Making A Murderer Part 1,UnKnown,2016.0,"I'm right here per your request, now you stuck in them shoes
No alliances with Meek, it's still fuck him too
Before we start, to the fans, I'm uncomfortable too
Stuck in the booth feelin' like y'all cause I got love for the dude
But now my phone blowin' up, they're like what I'm gonna do?
Show the world you shouldn't poke a man with nothin' to lose
All of this just because I wasn't in love with his 
Views
Whatever happened, I just know they got me fuckin' confused, hey

Mic check, mic check
One two, one two
Wait a minute!
Drake:
 I'm happy, I'm honored... I'm, I'm, I'm honored to be around you, man
Joe Budden:
 Yo c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Drake:
 Okay so I can't be honest on your network here? I can't be honest to your fans and say I'm honored to be around you?
Joe Budden:
 It ain't an honor to be around me!
Drake:
 We all used to listen to you so I don't even... you need to learn how to take compliments. Don't say that in vain, he's one of the best. You know that, right?
Other Person:
 What up? What up?
Drake:
 I said don't say it in vain, you know he's one of the best
Other Person:
 Nah it's all love
New Joe 
Budden!

Look, enough of the sentimental crap
Cool if you into that
Fuck all of these subs, who they intended at?
I won't believe it's me without forensic facts
They don't normally mention Black when pennin' their raps
But then I listen back, I heard a pinch of sass
Tender ass Teddy come around, he gon' get pinned to grass
I come around with every inch of the mag
I'm a wordsmith forreal, you thought Quentin was bad
You made me proud, lad, but it seems my child mad
With all the clout that he grabbed, it's still doubts from his dad
Look, this ain't promotional, you just emotional
No doubt you got Starbucks, with all that Joe in you
I part his reign lightnin' fast, just what Joseph do
A black cloud all over the 6, check the overview
You're so indirect, shit wasn't real clear
Either Jimmy actin' or he really miss a wheelchair
What he don't know is we the most kindred of souls
I should've did this two Kendricks ago
He wanna sing? Well let's get into the show, commence my role
For Jodeci, Boyz II Men, we at the end of the road
I figure he's that close to his death to know the reaper
In fitted sweats with old sneakers, the flow ether
Gassed cause he KO'd Omeeka, no Joe's deeper
Quick to put extension on singer, that's Moesha
Nothin' 'bout Rick slick, but show of the Caesar
My crust from the same old pizza as Mona Lisa
So how you callin' out the lyrical god?
Your face light up when you see me
, 
talkin' Miracle Watts
Cause your words ain't sayin' a thing
I kilogram without weighin' a thing
Nigga you baitin' a king
Tell you the way that Golden State say to it's team
Aubrey you gotta make a shot, you wanna play on the wing

Dem a call me a murderer
I never duck, just spray
I'ma never miss mi aim
Dem a call me a murder
There's some truth in that saying
Dem a call me a murder
Nobody seen nothing, nobody seen nothing
What I see, ayy

Look here, I just spit the facts, raging aristocrat
Shooters heard them words, wanna get rid of that
When they roll up, bet dude won't wanna live his raps
He'll see the 6 upside down and wanna switch it back
Wrath of a god sinner
I'm too real, I bet your star's tender
I bet a mil', I'll bet a star tender
But since the OG's Hov, here's what I wanna know
If ain't no real niggas allowed the fuck would I wanna go?
That's thinkin' back to Jay, now let's get back to Drake
Both too big to respond to all I have to say
Still with all their success and all their accolades
The universe makes it so they come right back to me
Here's a reminder that we go way back
I mean um, you know for me the kid is practice, Hova
I make these words flip as if they practice yoga
Okay practice over, back to Blacklist Hova
Nothin' personal, this Red Reddington
Shawn, I don't work for you, still I'm doin' the work for you
Payback, wire his jaw, reimbursin' you
Metal all behind his face, Sprite commercial you
Might have made a mistake out of this one
Can't Bell Biv Devoe your way out of this one, nah
So, warn your damn campaign that hammers rang
I just bought a New Edition, you can't stand the rain
Y'all say this soft nigga hard and that, I can't explain
Y'all think he's soul for real, I see candy rain
So Aubrey when you sub real MCs, you get murdered
And since you signed to five guys, makes you a burger

Dem a call me a murderer
I never duck, just spray
I'ma never miss mi aim
Dem a call me a murder
Nobody seen nothing, nobody seen nothing
What I see, ayy

Real quick, I don't wanna talk too long. I think you misconstrued the boundaries of this relationship and this friendship. Which in return, has caused me to do the exact same thing. I don't understand how you niggas, and how you in particular, how you can fuck shorty and I dap you and say you a real nigga, and I critique your album and all of a sudden we sensitive. I don't understand how you new niggas work. Maybe I'm out of touch with the rules of today's society. I'm clearing all that.
 
Now let me paint who I am before I allow another nigga to do it for me

I'm from the school of pussy don't get me punch drunk
Maybe it's different in the city you come from, look
I'm from the school of these hoes belong to everybody
No celeb exempt, goes for everybody
So when I seen you fucked shorty, not a bitter bone in me
I ain't think of how to handle the plan
Said I'm aware, have fun, understand that it's, fam
Told that to you and not her, that's just the man that I am
My nigga, kids got no respect
Odd cause you called me for the hoe check on every hoe you checked
That makes sense, bad bitches, that's what Joe do best
And I's the man 'round these parts when they ain't know you yet
Which kinda makes me your OG in Toronto
And I ain't charge once, that's for free in Toronto
I'm unsure how that came to be in Toronto
Nigga I don't even be in Toronto
When it rains it pours
All that means, dog, get please get a poncho
Subs fell short like a free throw from Rondo
So rude, he gay, so mean with all the Budden threats
As soon as we shoot at King, DeMarcus Cousins' next
This shit is truly a movie
You started a trend bein' a groupie for groupies
Shit, I had Bria in the coupe and out her way
Before you ever wrote an interlude about her
So who you playin' with, clown
I'm first shift at the bars, so only means I already made them rounds
They say that he the best MC and best flow'er
He cook better than me but you love my leftovers
Fire the kill shot, the fire still hot
Word to your Versace velours that Kyra still got
You playin' chess with the chrome of the pump
Let it blast, checkered past, shoulda known from the jump
It's whatever you wanna roll, executives got your soul
Sedatives, I'm repetitive with those records, show for
Regular Joe, sellin' records was never the goal
I never sold records, I kept records of what was sold
Might have made a mistake out of this one
Day's long, can't Trey Songz your way out of this one
So don't worry yourself, and before I go
Fuck a record label, I appear courtesy of myself, Joe",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-making-a-murderer-part-1-lyrics
Ordinary Love Shit 4 (Running Away),Some Love Lost,2014.0,"Tell me how long are we suppose to act like this?
We won't never get on track like this
How can I ever tell you how I feel if you react like this?
You call me over here to talk and I get attacked like this
It's funny
Got your track shoes on but what you running from
Shit I know where you going and where you coming from
That’s immaturity showing, its just the baby in you
One of the reasons why I never put a baby in you
Tired of hearing how you’ll never trust me again
How you love me, then you hate me, then you love me again
One minute I’m your soul-mate then it’s fuck me again
Until you get horny enough and wan' fuck me again, but check it
I just wan' treat you good and do better
You think I’m running round tryna be the hood's Hugh Heffner
Say I’m all about hoes, when I’m all about you
Even when I’m with my hoes, I tell them all about you
Say that’s just one reason I keep losing you
I don’t understand it, that shit is confusing too
You left me, I’m doing me, you doing you
So what the fuck is me doing me have to do witchu?
How dare you tell me it's tougher for you?
Like I don’t hear about them niggas you fucking with too?
I'd never knew you thought like that (dammit)
Who knew you was into sports like that
More prayers because they all players
You out there having a ball, player, ball player after ball player
I mean you with the ball players more than ball players
Hope they ain't fucking you and making you they ball-player
Come to me, I just get a hard time
Why they give one to you, is this what you wan' do?
With me you get an attitude, you get all stuck up
Start calling me a fuck up till I tell you shut the fuck up
Yeah, but the part I don’t respect is
You so cool with every other one of your exes
It's history between us, all ain't right either
Back and forth domestic, all ain't flights
 either
Be wanting you close to me, supposedly
You say you over me, that just comes across as a joke to me
'Cause you ain't got the kind of love that expires
Worst case, you’ll get tired, tell your friends I'm a liar
Tried therapy when we felt it going sour
That’s four-hundred dollars every hour
For him to come and mediate, referee, be our interpreter
Tell me I need to lower my voice, don’t curse at her
Says she’s only frustrated 'cause I keep hurtin' her
Tell me despite all that, he can tell that I worship her
Soon as you let your guard down, I get it up again
Fixing it is too much work, so I give up again
But I wan' spend the rest of my life with you
Make a wife with you, make it alright with you
But how are you ever suppose to think that I’m right for you
When all I ever do is treat you like a recyclable
Disgraceful and you want me to chase you
But it's easier for me to replace you, 'cause I see it like
If you can't deal with what we go through
I got bitches lined up, I got a ego too
And to them I’m everything, funny, I'm great and I’m charming
But to you I’m alarming, all I do is bring harm in
To you, I’m the cause of all your misery
Of course I disagree, you going off our history
All that arguing just ain't my style
'Cause that anger now got us like strangers now
You tell me I should get help and I’m sick in the head
You found makeup on the sheets, I had a bitch in our bed
But wait, I ain't love her though, I ain't fuck her though
I could dead that bitch right now man, fuck that hoe
You just think I'll get another and another hoe
Way you talk to me it's like I got a whole club of hoes
But I could switch gears, make 'em all disappear
You going through my phone like I got a bitch in there
We discussing chicks after they through
They don’t matter to me, but for some reason they matter to you
We keep having the same threesome
But not the kind that come as a blessing, nah
You keep bringing up my last girl like she ain't my past girl
Like you ain't the reason she present, check it
You ain't gotta worry about me and her
If I wanted to be with her I would be with her
Yeah, we hung together, strip clubs, had fun together
But that’s done, don't sweat her, uh
You the only one I wanna do a bid with
Live with, share my last name, have kids with
Can't be understated, anytime we ever dated
You compare me in your head to some nigga you created
I’m a long way from perfect, I got shit with me
Still I want you to love me unconditionally
Nine-years in, I don’t deserve what you giving me
Like you get a victory by acting like a dick to me
Want me to see how it feels, I get the trickery
Lesson learned though, you my missing piece
Give another chance to your ex
You don’t pick up the phone, you don’t answer my texts
Bitch, we ain't give it all that we got
Still ain't empty the clip, let's give it one more shot
Or we can go ahead on our own
I need you I can’t do this alone

But you keep running away
But you keep running away
But you keep running away
But you keep running away
But you keep running away
But you keep running away
But you keep running away",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-ordinary-love-shit-4-running-away-lyrics
Ordinary Love Shit (Parts 1 & 2),UnKnown,UnKnown,"My path for tomorrow is relaxing at full throttle
Born to be a leader but a tough act to follow
Bet on me at all costs in spite of my cash
So if I can’t afford the Waldorf, I can afford to fall off
Stories over greatness, no stopping my zone
I’m bumping ""Roman’s Revenge,"" but I’m plotting my own
Like a prophecy in case niggas haven’t learned not to bother me
'Fore you send your shots, just check my return policy
Could do without the leeches, shoes without the creases
Miami Heat hater but I do the South Beaches
For any drama I be calling up monsters
I ain't Gilbert I never met a Wall I can’t conquer
Ruger aimed if I’m who you try and belittle
I learned it’s hard to get justice when you try and be civil
Whatever the future holds I can live with the day
Some niggas will sell their soul but some will give it away
And that’s the devil in disguise they window of opportunity is minimized
Simplified, check what I exemplify
Bitch nigga, here’s something for you to generalize
Estate out by Tenafly, pool houses, winterized
Play in that water, you bound to get your feet wet
Only rapper with nuttin' to hide, me and G-Dep
My shorty might disagree with that sentiment
If I keep something from you, I promise it’s all innocent
Bitches gon get you with that fake out beat
I won’t let them Media Takeout me, a made nigga
Gotta know when dealing with me you gon' put up with a lot of hate
Before you say you love me, how much of it can you tolerate?
You can’t talk about marriage and giving birth
If you hit the dirt anytime you think I lift a skirt
It grows tiresome every time you get berserk
Plus if you abandon home over what was just a flirt (what?)
Without a care, I just chuck deuces
My skin'll turn numb and you’ll be stuck with what your truth is
Then you’ll feel a way, thinking I should have resisted
Then you’ll start to see a side of me you never knew existed
'Cause you never seen me act like a jerk
I know women will provoke you and get mad when it works
Rather reserved, and that always makes matters the worst
'Cause I go on about my business and not act like it hurts
But wait, it’s to the point I gotta ask myself
Why the fuck is it so easy to detach myself
Maybe it ain't you, just something I lack myself
But if these wounds are self inflicted I can patch myself
Now listen, I could give a fuck bout how them other niggas treated you
If your ass was that perfect they would be with you
I don’t care if you dime’d out
You’ll say you're the best I’ll ever have and I’ll say I’m willing to find out
Wait, I’m thinking bout our bond and what happened to it
If you ain't lifting the burden, you probably adding to it
She say my logic’s wild and it’s sick to her
She say I’m all for self and don’t consider her
She feel like she don’t have a voice in this relationship
I’m thinking boo you got a choice so why you taking it
Certain shit I wouldn’t stand for
I’m giving her my all but she demands more
I wish she would understand more
Certain shit you couldn’t plan for
I’m guessing if I love you and you're worth it
I should take some time out and figure if you deserve this
But you just think that I’m full of it
We both come from backgrounds of bullshit
I’m fortunate that ain't what you see in me
I’ll stop lying to you once you start believing me……

But I’m always who you wanna bring the questions to
It’s less about me hiding shit and more about protecting you
It’s totally different the way our minds are made up
To me flirting’s natural, to her it’s cause for break up
To me it’s human nature, she disagree with the logic
Confusing being monogamous with being robotic
I talk to other girls, I interact with 'em
You shouldn’t take that as tryna get in the sack with 'em
Just know how I act with you is how I act alone
I signed up for a girl not a chaperon
Besides that plan’ll backfire and I’ll dishonor her
She don’t take my word and now I feel I’m being monitored
And I want you to be the one that I endured the longest
Accept me at my weakest, support me at my strongest
Bring something to the table though, earn ya keep
Then I’ll triple it and all I ask in return is peace
Ain't with the arguing shit all the time
You see I’m honest to a fault but is it yours or mine
I put you through some things where you could have bolted
You want honesty or rather shit be sugar coated
I’ll put you on a list of people screaming fuck me too
Do you want a pretty lie or the ugly truth?
Truth is you got some things that you gotta learn too
When everything that concerns me don’t concern you
Truth is you gotta a couple tainted views
And you bring up my ex as if I couldn’t do the same with you
Truth is you want me the dude that kept it realer
Truth is you’re too emotional and need a better filter
No third party will ruin our plan
I’d hate for you to be the girl who’s too consumed with her man
So I want you to have your own plans
You to have you own ends, you to have your own life
You to have your own friends and I’ll be right beside you
I can tell that you pride full
Cause you don’t bring up problems that you got with me till I do
You say that I’m out a lot and that I ain't here enough
You take care of me and I’ll take care of us
I’d love to put a child in you and live lavish
But my baby momma scared me, let me tell you bout my baggage
We could have a son and break up and be done
And now I’ll never see him again
As you take him and run
You gon’ tell him that he’s fatherless
Tell him that I’m cowardly
You’ll have some resentment so you’ll start acting childishly
You’ll rape me in court cause of course you’ll have it out for me
To you it may sound absurd but for me it’s a reality
Still at times where it seems like you’re not proud of me
Though I’m showing you the best man I know how to be
But you keep saying show me more
You’d appreciate me better had you known me before
You’ve never been cheated on
Had another chick in your house in your bed
You, you ain't seen the worst time
Hit you with that old move
Take you to a flick that I’ve already seen with another broad
But pretend like it’s my first time
And, nah you don’t know how that sound
On the phone with you, while she quiet in the background
Bunch of shit that I ain't in a hurry to do
So before you beef, know that he got buried for you
I dont tell you that for points, nah, you can keep the brownies
I tell you so that you know I was mature when you found me
Tell you so you know that little boy shit that I get annoyed with
You should keep it coy with, cause all that is, is stress for me
I’m not ya ex baby girl, you not a catch for me
I mean respectfully, certain shit I’m not a glutton for
For every bad bitch, there’s a nigga tired of fucking her
But you could be my wife forever
Let’s grow old live life together
Vacay, catch flights, take pictures
Everything that my last broad always wanted but got a beef with me when she asked for it...",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-ordinary-love-shit-parts-1-and-2-lyrics
She Don’t Put It Down,No Love Lost,2012.0,"She ain’t got a leg to stand on
Don’t even trip

I can take you all over the world though
Even tell you pack light
The last slide couldn’t even get a cab ride
She don’t do the blogs, but if she did, she’d be on mad sites
Ass so mean that I’m always on her bad side
Uh, now she don’t ever stress me ’bout my whereabouts
Never seems concerned
With other birds that she may hear about
She mind hers, since mine's hers
That shit she barely care about
Look amazing on me, why I’m always tryna wear her out
She don’t ride like you, no, she don’t taste like that
Not with a waist like that, do I let her go to waste like that?
She a mix between Kama Sutra, yoga and porno flicks
Funny how her breath get shorter when I give her long dick
Uh, and I’m telling y’all straight up
Might think I imagined shorty even when she not made-up
She kill ‘em in Levi’s, see why? It ain’t even fair
Look good in whatever she wear
How could other women compare? They can’t

I done put another in your space
Damn, after you, it’s been hard to replace
I just want the same judge sitting on the case
She gon' hate, but she know
She don’t put it down like you, down-down like you
Down-down like you, down-down like you
She don’t put it down like you, down-down like you
Down-down like you, down-down like you
She don’t put it down like you
Girl, you working with the killer
Ain’t nobody fucking with ya
She don’t put it down like you, down-down like you
Down-down like you, down-down like you
She don’t put it down like you

I can see the stars in the day time
Bitch, I miss you, like a deadline
And the girl I’m with is just the girl I’m with
I mean it’s working out, so we’re staying fit
But you know love is nothing; ask Stan Smith
But I gotta keep a bad bitch, like Brad Pitt
Remember our first kiss? Or our last kiss?
I used to go dummy in that pussy; crash test
You be fuckin' that nigga like you was fucking me?
Ha, fuck that nigga! He can’t fuck with me
I’m Tunechi, bitch, and you know that
And that pussy throw back
But any given night, I’d still pop that ass, like a Prozac
Girl, you know you got that murder, a beast in that La Perla
And every time we cut, I used to shred her; Ninja Turtles
And I know you still love me, and I know you still for me
That’s why we still fuckin'
‘Cause she don’t put it down like you

I done put another in your space
Damn, after you, it’s been hard to replace
I just want the same judge sitting on the case
She gon' hate, but she know
She don’t put it down like you, down-down like you
Down-down like you, down-down like you
She don’t put it down like you, down-down like you
Down-down like you, down-down like you
She don’t put it down like you
Girl, you working with the killer
Ain’t nobody fucking with ya
She don’t put it down like you, down-down like you
Down-down like you, down-down like you
She don’t put it down like you

Love being around mine, no downtime
Still nothing else even matters
Can’t even walk slow through that mall
‘Cause paparazzi running after
Baby girl working it like a pro, slow it down or move it faster
Whether them lights on or them lights off
Like I’m sleeping with the clapper
Say she watching what she eat, yet that ass keep getting fatter
How I’m sexing her
Makes that ex of hers no longer be a factor
Plus her and I already know, you done turn them all to Casper
Climb with the former rather latter
You already know which one I’d rather cum on

I done put another in your space
Damn, after you, it’s been hard to replace
I just want the same judge sitting on the case
She gon' hate, but she know
She don’t put it down like you, down-down like you
Down-down like you, down-down like you
She don’t put it down like you, down-down like you
Down-down like you, down-down like you
She don’t put it down like you
Girl, you working with the killer
Ain’t nobody fucking with ya
She don’t put it down like you, down-down like you
Down-down like you, down-down like you
She don’t put it down like you",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-she-dont-put-it-down-lyrics
More of Me,A Loose Quarter,2012.0,"I give you my all
But it seems like that's not enough
Lettin' you get more of me
So while the world keep on changin'
The one thing remainin'
Is I keep lettin' you get more of me

My story, my pain, can't ail it
My tears overflowed, you can't pale it
My talent too immense, can't jail it
Niggas tried to cross the God, but they ain't nail it
My path, my walkway, you can't trail it
My ladder, my mountain, can't scale it
It's my life, my struggles, can't help it
I'm just grateful that He kept me alive for me to tell it
Check it, see the music industry changed me
It was everything that I'd have never guessed it was
So my discography is all full of hand-me-downs
I couldn't figure out another way to dress it up
So every verse spiked with the truth
Nah, no one know me better than this mic and this booth
It's no better way, I owe my today to my yesterdays
You live with regrets, probably die with 'em too
So I trust God more than myself, I'm tryna tell ya
Was drunk in the basement, now I'm in the wine cellar
I learned to never let the fear settle in
And now I'm more prepared than I've ever been
Not one ounce of hate in my glans
Just one of the things OG taught me way in advance
Said it's two types of folk in this world
Got the ones that's out doin' it, and those busy sayin' they can't

I give you my all
But it seems like that's not enough
Lettin' you get more of me
So while the world keep on changin'
The one thing remainin'
Is I keep lettin' you get more of me

You know some niggas never learn
Some learn and never apply
But wait, some apply but never teach
My only right to preach, I spent time being each
Grab that magnifying glass, I need y'all to look closer
At the only dude to do every drug and get lower
If niggas knew a third of all the weight that he shouldered
They'd know it an insult to think I'm only bipolar
I got a unique talent, don't know how I obtained it
How do I sustain it? Can't even explain it
I get more info from words that aren't spoken
More fixated on people or things when they are broken
I used to think everybody was pure
Now I'm busy tryin' to come up with everybody's cure
And that mindset led to close alarms
It be the people you help most, normally do the most harm
Baited my whole life, most times I ain't bite
So no need to stick to a script that I ain't write
Preconceived notions, nothin' less than a failure
Base you's off of the cover and miss the best-seller
While I'm at it, let me tell you 'bout this angel I met
She was fly, from every angle was fresh
And the way that she was jammin' to the song called 'I'm Not Perfect' made me wanna know what her imperfections were
Now listen, and they weren't hard to find, y'all
Both parents were addicts like mine are
Mi-nor, but her story wasn't new to me
Most her life, shorty was homeless like I used to be
Could tell she never felt appreciated
Looked too much like her dad, was her mom's least favorite
Picture a bond supposed to be sacred
Lookin' up at your mom's eyes and seein' hatred
Pop left when she was young
Well, she still young and he still gone, keep it a hundred
While I'm just amazed that a woman so beautiful
Could go through such ugliness and not become it
World keeps spinnin', learned sinners keep sinnin'
And I can't even tell her some fights ain't fight worthy
'Cause my pops got 20 years clean
But her pops got 20 years dirty
She moved to Jersey where he happens to reside
Thinkin' they'll be closer, but it's only fiction
'Cause she so young all it does is cause friction
God picked the right nigga though to teach about addiction
Years ago she shoulda been on homi' watch
So check the time out, just not on Mommy watch
'Cause someone beat her ass for years, someone calmly watched
Nah, stepdaddy beat her ass, Mommy watched
I keep her closer than ever, she always next to me
Bisexual, comfortable sexually
I’m talkin' more comfortable than she should ever be
Especially considered the fact she was molested three
Times, 
some things a picture doesn’t tell
Can’t be worth a thousand words or her pictures might yell
Y’all see a pretty face on Instagram
I see a girl that should be scarred, never lent a hand
There go God’s work again, how’d he know I need that?
How the fuck did he pick her to walk me through a relapse?
Believe me, shorty, I’ll kill for you if need be
And I need you much more than you would ever think you need me
What I do for you is tangible, shit that you can gain
You for me, not understandable, it's shit I can’t explain
Some folk don’t see the effect in that
Some say I’m usin' you, they’d be correct in that
But what for they’ll never know
It’s deeper than nude pics, it’s somethin' I would never show

I figured like this…
You came to me at a pool party
And I was two steps away from smokin' on that wet
My logic say to me, you came to me as a stranger and I hold you dearer than most people I ever met in my entire life, b
God’s work, not mine
You came younger and wiser, I'd have never known it
You don’t look your age
Younger and wiser when I was older and dumber
You came to me as nothin' I'd have ever wanted
But everything I'd have ever needed
I swear to you its God's work, not mine

So you'll never be alone again
What's mine is yours, you won't be without a home again
And I know you from Miami, so you hate the cold
But you been through much colder than me and I'm much older
You just ride shotgun, let a nigga chauffeur
I'll cut the grass, you just look out for the cobras
We'll be just fine, God set these on our shoulders
I'll show you a man, you showed me I could stay sober
Let the world talk about every picture we post up
And we'll sleep well every night, 'cause they don't know us

I give you my all (God's work)
But it seems like that's not enough (Talk to 'em!)
Lettin' you get more of me
So while the world keep on changin'
The one thing remainin'
(Sometimes you gotta stick around for the miracle)
Is I keep lettin' you get more of me
(Gotta wait for the miracle to happen
God's work, not mine)

I said, God's work, not
Word, I love you
I'm gone

Afraid (Drake Diss),UnKnown,2016.0,"What am I afraid of?
This is supposed to be what dreams are made of
But people I don't have the time to hang with
Always look at me and say the same shit
They say you promised you would never change

I just feel like you broke a promise to me
Only hurt cause I thought you were being honest with me
So I’m gon' try and do this honorably
Without the sponsoring fee what’s most alarming to me
This so emotional for you, robust such the calm in me,
Easy to put off notes in thugs harmony
Speak to his insecurity, acting so irresponsibly
And it's further impacted by the fact that you respond to me
See some of us know you as Jimmy barely old
He had the baby belly fro, nigga was frail up in his clothes
Barely got a hold and it’s seeming very outta control
Wish we could go back and grab the blackberry with the scroll, oh
Yeah Aubrey that’s the one we trusted
Not this new Aubrey with his stomach sculpted
I'm disgusted, you're such a fuckin' incumbent
Can't govern, trust in the public becoming a fucking puppet
It’s bigger than rap battles, a word for the digital cash castle Don’t let a glitch in the Mac crash you
Unrelaxed wearing political straps tackled
Now clash paths with dad, the original bad apple
I know where you at, shit I was there too
When shit was happening fast, word, I got scared too
Impossible feats, impossible to sleep
Making promises impossible to keep like

What am I afraid of?
This is supposed to be what dreams are made of
But people I don't have the time to hang with
Always look at me and say the same shit
They say you promised you would never change

Listen, alert the niggas that handle you
You fill up tour seats but you raw meat to the animals
Doggy to cannibal, morning coffee and sandal shoes
Can’t get this energy off me, it isn’t tangible
This shit is greater than me, Pitchfork and Fader agree
Complex I’m waiting to see, this between us, A and B
You on the cusp Rated G, film I ain’t paying to see
I’m patiently waiting with please
Thought you would take it in, breathe
Blatantly seein' his whole channel real A&E
Hard to sound empty inside and fill a vacancy
Get some advice, come over kick it and vibe
I’m here with hotels, strippers, Odell, all that shit that you like
We'll light some candles and some hookah
Hookers flickin' the lights
We'll play Aaliyah's greatest hits, you'll get all tickled inside
My nigga, It's no wonder you're losing all your friends
Poster child now for all that you had a wall against
And tell your mans I’ll be seeing him soon
He marched you right into this madness I got reason to assume
I creep in his room, sweeper consumed
Now his region of doom ain’t the legion of boom it's just me with a broom
Afterward I’m thinking we can resume a lesson in speaking too soon
How is it too late if I’m reading ya tomb
It's not, boys inordinate, ploys and ornaments
Show up at party next door with a noise ordinance
So off the hook of me, maybe y'all should be shook of me
Should know I’d kill him at even the slightest push of me
And when his team press up shirts, I’ll help 'em push a tee, Should it read, he pressed buttons but wouldn’t push a tee
Gotta be buggin', maybe he dunno where Pusha be
Or when Pusha push the agenda he isn’t pushed to see
If pushed to the streets, I see wood in your physique
Thinking you misunderstood my hood, this isn’t Meek nigga
This ain’t a standard that you couldn’t meet
Just from your views, you prolly couldn’t see
That's cool, that kind of success you could never plan for it
Heard the question nigga, I’ma help you answer it

What am I afraid of?
This is supposed to be what dreams are made of
But people I don't have the time to hang with
Always look at me and say the same shit
They say you promised you would never change

What am I afraid of?
What am I afraid of?
What am I afraid of?
What am I afraid of?

What am I afraid of?

Wake,UnKnown,2016.0,"New Joe Budden!
Good afternoon everyone. I'm Kenny Powers. If you're here and you're someone Shane cared about, or someone Shane loved. Or maybe you're just somebody who has no business being here at all who's just here because you think it's gonna make you more popular. You know, Shane and I used to fuck around big time. We fuckin' partied hard. We'd ride our vehicles around. Slay ass

My condolences, my condolences
Whole family in mourning send my condolences
My condolences, crazy I just spoke to him
Courtney dropping drinks all in Hooters
She losin' focus shit
Don't send a text, I don't care y'all mad
Shit, I waited 5 days nigga where y'all at?
For real, I'm calling Stunna
Cause all Summer 16, ain't heard a hot 16 'bout all Summer
Awareness is high, say attention I'm seeking
Since I'm reaching, it's offensive they're convinced I'm a demon
Such a thin disagreement, son my kin for a reason
Killing you is expected of me, I don't win an achievement
Somebody pinch me I'm dreaming, take this mental reprievement
Since I know the nigga, I know this ain't the man that I'm seein'
I heard it straight from the 'Bama's mouth, he won't pull a hammer out
Wasn't you at Hov's show scared to pull the camera out?
I'm seeing habits switch, magic tricks
You froggy behind that Apple fix
The passiveness in your manner I might react to it
Automatic shit
Ratchet kids at your crib that can't even spell Calabasas bitch
So I take all the guns, load half the clips
I just notice you run, we mention half the Clipse
I'll save that for another time I'll get back to it
I'm kinda shocked to look at what we've advanced to
Knew it'd get you dismantled, knew the issues I ran through
Sick of the scandal, or maybe I just misunderstand you
I kept it a buck, thought that, that was shit you could handle
You said that you wondered if anything you doin' was brand new, right?
I got him, no one help, father punch below the belt
Introspection means dig deep, let's look below the wealth
I wanna know myself
How you tell bitches know they self
When you don't even know yourself?
You wouldn't know yourself
Say he Canadian, maybe Asian, Croatian
Be sounding like his Jamaican friends, depend on what state he in
I think you rap good, but you a movie star
So that owl's appropriate, we don't know who you are
Where did the boy's brain change? Was it the club scene?
Now you sound like you use people and love things
But later for how you use people and love things
The entendres that upswing when I call you drug king
That record contract, leaves a lot to exam
Never dealt drugs in his life, but sold a lotta gram
That's too much baking soda, good thing my break is over
They thinking cause my paper lower, this for Rage to blow up
Or maybe they just woke up
You leverage your celeb, taking waves over
That's territorial takeover
Maybe he thinks nobody notices
Gucci wasn't home two seconds before you rode his dick
Bodied Versace flows, copy, that he stole
Ay dios mio, sorry Migos, adios amigo
Was that your plot all along?
Why you ain't do that vid with Fetty but you hopped on the song?
No really, we want a Party album
But you keep stealing all of Party's album
To go and put it on your party album
It's plenty reason to slay you
Kept going up Tuesday's and now The Weeknd just hates you
Are you lifeless? Sound like a zombie on the track
Remember ""Started From the Bottom,"" it was Zombie on the Track
Know who else started from the bottom? Zombie on the Track
How come after that joint I don't see Zombie on a track?
I'm from Jersey, so Zombie I got your back
Be alarmed the real is finally back
Get your guard up now, hope your heart up now
Battery in him, let's see if he get charged up now
I'm wake
I'm wake
We at the wake

Who's Goose and who's Tom Cruise?
Well now that Shane is dead I guess we know who is Goose. Shane is Goose. Cause in that motion picture, Goose dies, so Shane is dead so he would be Goose",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-wake-lyrics
Lost Control (Freestyle),UnKnown,UnKnown,"Soul of a 70's number man, I can throw a curve underhand
This for the streets, not Summer Jam
This ain't for the fans that wanna hear pop and snap
Drunk off Ciroc and the Yak, all y'all can watch from the back
This ain't for self proclaimed legends that nobody wanna hear from
Scared? Get a gun; come to peers, I got none
This ain't for bandwagon fans sit y'all asses in the same spot
Y'all the same niggas made Trinidad Jame$ hot
This ain't to Kendrick Lamar, the nigga Kendrick got bars
I heard his shit and wasn't offended at all
And as it played I heard him say I wasn't mentioned with y'all
Joell started it, only right I finish the job
So all that shit is revocable, from an overview
Only thing noticeable is how he barely gave me any quotables
I state facts, not to say it's wack but check the playback
Outrhyming A$AP ain't showing me where your weight at
I'm on my shit today, you the king of New York
You might as well had spit on Biggie's grave,
 
couldn't let that slip away
I'm in the court of public opinion, ready to click and spray
Light Jay Elec ass up, that's my Exhibit A
Bitch kill my vibe is what you wanna get into
Drown em all in a swimming pool, full of phlegm and drool
You renting jewels what's with all the fascination?
So when I ask you 'bout it that's my cross examination
This a scrimmage to me, all these blemished MC's
Infamously it's about image I see
But if it's bars, not about bread, to hell with the wealth
Put you inside of the bullet, just to see a shell of yourself
I mean uh, since rap has been accessible, they action been regrettable
This is what the net'll do
Chick sending message to tricks ain't get to see 'em
They ain't even artists and they get paid per diem
We talking bars, then this whole conversation changed
Fuck all the subliminals now nigga saying names
Some of these OG's I laugh at, y'all don't know me to half ass
To me it's just one Joey that's bad ass
King of New York,
 
my nigga stop it 5
Keep it funky Drake washed you twice
Tell me Tyler that fire with saliva? I reply don't bring a lie around
Run up on Meek with the silencer, nigga quiet down
Then ride off with his intro playing
Cause I get hype to that shit dog I ride to that shit
With nightmares, I wanna be at the root of em with the mag off
Know he love Philly so I'm leavin' him with Black Thoughts
You talking bars niggas better get help
They put they guts all on the track, still they never get felt
Lot of lower tier rappers tryna rep for they belt
Nigga there's levels to this shit, dog you said it yourself
But check it, when it comes to control, I might have lost a bit
Law abiding citizen style I'm coming for all of it
Running in your studio engineer that recorded it
Yes men that supported it, any blog that reported it
Any artist he tour with, snuff whoever bought the shit
Whoever thought of it, his mentor whoever taught him it
Interrupt with a sneeze, hiccup, fart, even cough or lick
If I got it twisted you coming to contort the shit
But the irony, y'all all inspire me
Y'all in a spot a lot of us aspire to be
We just striving my G, tip my hat so y'all know it's real
Fuck whoever mad, you said how we all suppose to feel
I know the game, some'll try to get amped
You push the envelope, some of us provided the stamp
Predecessors wrote the letter, others sealed it shut
Some was nice without the percs, before Amil got touched
It's Hip Hop, should blame on the mic these niggas hands on
Shades that they wear in the club, couches they stand on
You mixed credibility with dead ability
Raise the bar like you on par with this level of agility
Old UNLV Runnin' Rebel artillery, with Augmon at the 2
What sparring y'all wanna do?
Get to arguing with a Spartan, play it cool
I heard them alien voices, I'll knock the martian up outta dude
Separate the beast from the timid, it's hip hop
Fuck if your car is lease or rented, at least you in it
Foaming at the lips, looking like the yeast in women
Don't be facetious most of y'all been a feast from the beginning
This is for B.I.G., Suicidal Thoughts, Coogi printed
This for Nas, army jacket with the uzi in it
Not no Shiny Suit shit,
 
this that 92 Knicks
This for Hov's missing 92 bricks
For State Prop and Beans,
 
to when the L.O.X. first burst on the scene
For Queens, Pac and even 
E.D.I. Mean
This for the Mobb and the purple tape, word to Inspectah Deck
This ain't for the labels nah,
 
Wu said protect ya' neck
This ain't a diss, I don't want it to get spun wrong
And this for Big L, the block that Joe found Pun on
This shit is for Stack, I ain't talking a G
Nigga I'm talking a G!! My nigga talking on me
This is for every living rapper ever walked in these streets
And any outsider that happen to think that a portion is sweet
Niggas been killed for less and got a coffin for free
If you ever been in the hood, I think we all should agree
This for every nigga that took what you said in stride
I couldn't abide, some of us still take pride, check it
Limbs'll get crushed, hip hop's adrenaline rush
Men'll get touched, so if you feminine hush
Project benches I trust
, 
came from syringes and dust
So who you named shouldn't be mentioned with us
But wait, at least half of em', other half rapped around
Dual clips that wrap around, gather every rapper 'round
See what happen when niggas try to go toe to toe
This what happen when you let a blood bath overflow
Used to do lines, how could they wanna go blow for blow
I could overdose and still drag you niggas comatose
This is lightweight, put the bucks up
Cause if we talking bars lot of y'all should shut the fuck up
This is lightweight, put the bucks up
If we talking bars lot of y'all should shut the fuck up",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-lost-control-freestyle-lyrics

(But I know that whatever it is is completely inappropriate for you to do being while you're in a relationship.) So you don't know what's happening? (Of course I don't know. I'm not physically there—) But whatever is happening... (—to see whatever it is. Something is). Something definetly is happening, right? (Something is).

New Joe Budden
One and two was for y'all
This one's for me
Check this (talk to 'em)

I finally found a passion I lacked before
Can't believe I didn’t catch ya under the act before
I mean I voiced my complaints, that went ignored
A few things you felt that you was too attractive for
'Cause e'erything out your mouth said that you ain't wanna hurt
Love the lifestyle we lived, but you ain't wanna work
So I’d sit you down and say it's getting outta hand
While you shoot down e'ery idea, busy worried about a brand
When ya baby dad said all that shit that was trife
How you was married, requesting dick pics from Lyfe
Though it all seemed shady, maybe I was crazy
I ignored my gut feelin', nah, not my baby
Accusing me, but pretending yourself
I couldn’t catch it, too busy defending myself
Or was I wrong not seeing a life without you
Or taking e'erything that you said at face value
You packed up and left, dude, I was so glad
Should've questioned how you easily became a nomad
If I could do it all again, it wouldn’t’ve happened so fast
And it burns with every line jotted in this notepad
'Cause at first you resembled my twin
Fast forward, you gave me identical twins
But then you lost it, honestly that murked my soul
'Cause though we wadn't tryna have one, we got off the birth control
And we was right back at it, fucking like addicts
While you was disrupting what was seeming like a marriage
You never got embarrassed, interrogating me but that was just Yaris
Yeah, we beef and I dragged you off the bed
I swear to this day I re-enact it in my head
So I hemmed you up, wasn’t what I aimed to do
I ain't attack you, bitch, I was restraining you
But you was wifey, though I understand that it's not a game
Can you imagine my surprise when the cops came
Handcuffed me, you pressed charges
But I made bail, it's just heartless
You can't smash my laptop on the wall
And then think I wasn’t gonna react, scratch that
I mean you can't call my mom like can I crash at your spot, whattup
When I’m her son and you just locked me up
But wait, this is when it really gets deep
Judge says she get control of the house for a week
Filed a restraining order so she couldn’t come near me
The fuck else I do but go right back to Tahiry
I’m sleeping on her couch, not discussing shit
Staring at the fattest ass, not fuckin' it
I guess despite everything that she showed me
It felt good to be around a broad that really knows me
I missed all our arguin' and yappin'
Percocets and muscle relaxers in a napkin
Can't believe that it happened (why?)
I lost my unborn daughter when we fought
I’m thinking I killed Aspen
And that’s when I thought that we’d be dead awhile
But we decided to reconcile
So hungover from love and what not
How could you not expect us to take another shot
But during all this time we don't live together
Stupid me thought you'd go get your shit together
You know, get a job or if acting’s your career
Seems you’ve pursued the shit for a year from right here
And it appears, along with all the yelling and the screaming
We both at the table, but my side is leaning
But rather than end it, we tried to mend it
Fuck bein' a couple, let's work on a friendship
But then it got weird, I was stunned from that
You took it to a place where there was no coming back
Off my last break up, I was able to stomach that
Two weeks removed and you fuckin' with a running back
Life is in shambles, disguised as a damsel
Lies are a handful
Bouncing off of, different guys lookin' scrambled
Despised how it was handled
But when you ain't got a dime, why not decide to gamble
Said you’d be in L.A. doing business
I’m thinking that’s great, I can't fault her
Said you'd be with Jennifer the whole time
But you prob'ly didn’t think that I would call her
She said she ain’t seen you since you landed
And for days she been blowing up your phone like a stalker
And all I could do is laugh at myself
As I thought, why is old girl sucking off Derrick Ward for?
Said we was makin' it right, but you couldn’t
Was on the phone, I said Skype, but you wouldn’t
The puzzle starts coming together and it's brutal
Won’t Skype, Gmail chat, won't Oovoo
The whole time I’m noticing you actin' unusual
And I can't figure out who the fuck you being true to (nah)
Said the Wi-Fi was down in the tele
But you ain't say you was at hotel his house
Lookin' like a groupie
Or maybe I misunderstood when you said y'all two was makin' a movie
Looking at the shit pile I stepped in again
And to top it off your hoe ass is pregnant again? Not again
I been through the world so I suck it up
It's less about the lie more about the cover-up
So you busted, but you addin' to the friction
'Cause you deny it all but you do it with conviction
So you talkin' to me real disparaging
So what attitude, coming off arrogant
If I wanted a trophy wife, then you could be
But all it look like is that you renting out pussy
Less about you, nah, you ain't the one
You grown, you got choices, I’m worried 'bout your son
That’s what got me up being an insomniac
Little nigga can't control how his mommy act
As for me, I’m tryin' flush you out my system
So I counter by filming all my sexual encounters
Mentally not there while I’m screwing
And I only keep going 'cause that's what your doing
I’m tryna see how's it done, how's it possible
Enough to put a weak nigga in a hospital
Starin' at one ex, talking about another
But this one would kill if it meant I wouldn't suffer
But she taking little shots, I'm getting ridiculed
'Cause all she complained about, I went and did with you
Said she knew it wouldn’t last when I lived with you
""She’s not your type, she ain't got the right hips for you""
So you try and take some'in' for pain, it don't work
You still feel it all, the Novocaine don't work
Nope, so we good, I don't let it get me down
Not a pussy that good nor a titty that round
For anything to work, y'all trust is a must
And I learned, gotta let a mutt be with a mutt
So I dead that bitch and though the shit’s been over
Some situations don't end without closure",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-ordinary-love-shit-part-3-closure-lyrics

Hit this gin make things move slower

Ride it sound just like a newer motor
They're wondering how I get these mills and still live like a stoner
No other way, 
I get a 100k from each promoter
Or more than that, hold up
Money long it don't fold up
Let me get some gin pour up
Got some bomb weed roll up

And, wait I said that all wrong
She don't need to rock it when I put my hard in
My new nickname is just watch
Might not join might just watch
New yacht master just a watch
Doubtin' me I tell em just watch
Them diamonds yellow them beams are red
And them hands are tucked they don't show
Plus them shooters with me got the green light
So why the fuck you don't think they won't go?
Hold up, your chick traded post game
And no shame she felt your man
She probably on Joe Johnson
Cause I never be on that Elton Brand
It's YSL, she's fly as hell
Tell the come to go to my ride
You can't blame hoes ain't Peter Rose
Now she a thorn in my side, grow up
P-R-P-S is over my Timbs
Way shorty blew me at it was only right I showed her my bench

My main bitch like shorty
Got my top down, her hair out
Isolation and she clear out
Fast break, my bread straight
One hand shake and I bail out
Hit streets corner bitches calling tell em bring a friend

SlaughterMouse,All Love Lost,2015.0,"Yeah, yeah
Look, it was around '99, baby comin' while I was at rock bottom
Ironic shit, I was listenin' to ""Rock Bottom""
Pockets rabbit ears, no paper, lot of cotton
Had some charges stemmin' from me and my squad robbin'
Had to leave the hood, shit stayin', not an option
I bumped your shit forever, felt we had a lot in common
A rapper expressin' wit who spoke in depressive stints
All that introspectiveness, I couldn't measure what it did
Listen, I'm writin' to you now cause we don't get to talk much
'Cept for in the stu' when we be passin' through the halls and such
I wonder if you catch me stare at you in awe much
And we be busy workin' so I never share my thoughts much
Remember signin' four niggas with an attitude?
Well maybe we'll get your star power and his magnitude
All I thought was it was 'bout to be on
But I never guessed that I was 'bout to be wrong
We encountered some things, maybe we should've figured out all along
Who the fuck was I to be too vocal in my doubt for some songs?
Even I can't be that dumb to step over the threshold
And be the guy who says no to so many records sold
Whole career, I never bit my tongue, I let it go
Too many times bein' the rebel, ain't end in what's best for Joe
That second album came and added truth to the slander
But we learned what's good for the goose ain't good for the gander
Guess I'm askin' for advice right now
Experience and leadership to help suffice right now
I guess I'm askin', ""How would you do it?""
Before I do somethin' too stupid
Before my group lose it just to get our views lucid
Every other day these niggas want a new exclusive
Should I be in the mix more? Maybe I'm too secluded
Do you think you'd be as famous now
If you had to put out ""My Name Is"" now?
The way the game is now, awful lyrics, shit is shameless now
Just tell me how you'd maneuver if you came in now
It's just thoughts, everything is criss-crossed
Gotta be cool with Complex and Pitchfork if I wanna get my shit off
These simpleminded niggas won't think you fuck with us
If they don't see you poppin' bottles in the club with us
It's about fashion now, which I hate
Because I dress like shit, I'm just the best when I spit
But different times, I was feelin' like the odd man out
Like I should leave, they'd be better with the odd man out
Like when I wasn't on that intro, I felt a little weird
But that was for the team, so I didn't really care, for real
For the team, how I happen to be
When Bad met Evil, nigga who was happier than me?
Think back, the way that I was on that shit
You woulda thought it was my album and I was on that shit
Like fuck rap, happy to see a friendship get mended
Cemented and any frivolous tension get ended
Joell you my G, Weapon Waist you my OG cuz
Nickel you know I look at you like it's blood
Here's the flowers, before this end is covered in mud
We can disband right now and it's gonna always be love
For a brief period I tried to rhyme like y'all
I was high, maybe tryin' to prove that I'm like y'all
But I'm not, I suck at all that syllable shit
I'd rather make the pen bleed to see the feelin' you get
I'm bein' honest, we might never sell a million and shit
To me it's more value in keepin' it trill with my nigs
And to Em, one of the illest ever on the mic
We're less different than we are alike
This ain't about star power, I ain't on the hype
Never mind skin color, I see beyond the white
My whole life I fought trauma like you
Had ups and downs with my baby mama like you
I had my fair share of transgressions like you
Had a bad temper once and fought aggression like you
Did drugs, popped pills, fought depression like you
These are things you'd never pick up from our sessions in the stu'
I beefed with Hov, 50, Game and Wu
Got in my own way a lot, I'm sure the same as you
The whole label think I'm crazy, I been peeped it
I'm only mad I couldn't keep a better secret
Still when I hear your voice, my head goes wrong
Takes me back to that little boy with my headphones on
And the way you saved my life back then is how I'm savin' them
Plaques and charted tracks won't take me away from them
So I hope you understand
Fuck this record deal, you inspired me as a man
I'll cut it short, before I start feelin' like a Stan
HouseGang for life, word to the pig on Royce's hand
Success'll never disable me
No record label will ever label me
My morals ain't for sale, can't under-the-table me
I'll ride it out, even when everything ain't savory
My brothers love me, they won't enable me
And they won't kill me, they won't Cain and Abel me
It’s how I feel at the moment...",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-slaughtermouse-lyrics
Castles,No Love Lost,2013,"My castle started shrinking, something's gotta give
Ended up being the smallest place that I had ever lived
One of the reasons I would do away with fame, to say the least
Don't know who these people are, their names ain't on the lease
It's a different type of monster, entertainment is a beast
Was supposed to eat together, then I became the main feast
If you preying on my kindness, taking advantage of Joe's cool
I'd have to ask, what's your definition of soul food?
I bust my ass for my whole life, and I worked hard for my profit
And envy I know cuts like a knife, so you probably work hard to stop it
If you know me like you claim then how could you disregard my logic?
You know I cut my arm short and put my heart in my pocket
A pretty good judge of character, maybe I mistaked a few
Cut some people off, but had no choice, it's what they made me do
Why would you take advantage when it's something I'd have gave to you?
And in the long run, it doesn't take from me, it takes from you
You'll probably tell me I'm a fucked up nigga
You got it wrong, I just won't be fucked up with you
Which forces me get distant, and I never want to act a way with you
But passion and desire never blends with lackadaisical
No longer enable you, that's no longer favorable
But pride is on your sleeve so you'll just act like nothing phases you
Which can never equal good, in fact
So love can't be lost, I know exactly where I put it at

Word. Got no problem with nobody though
So have no problem with me. Figured
No beef, no malice. I got no vendetta with y'all
So I only want better for myself
Might even want better for y'all

My castle started shrinking, I tried my best to fight it
Don't know how it happened, don't know how they got invited
Was good with cabin fever, and maybe that helped create the space
Fuck your good intentions, more concerned with what's taking place
But everyone feels entitled, made up their mind they got a right to
My peers transforming right before my eyes into my rivals
Y'all can have the cars, yall can have the clothes, take all that shit that I don't love
I'm learning fast that recognition is its own drug
And what's worse than some of your actions being feminine
Is I got no way of knowing if your moves are really genuine
You there when it's bright, better be there when it's dark
You wasn't there for the ride, don't be there when I park
Figure I love niggas enough to let the world come and stay with me
And I'll stay trapped in this room to keep ya'll away from me
What's supposed to happen when I'm not hot anymore?
Your job rely on me being crazy, but what if I'm not anymore?
The funny shit, them molly's were cool when we all were doing em
But nobody recalled when I was the only one they were ruining
I learned a long time ago in life that not much is fair
So no love lost, but not much is there
Deja vu, this happened rapidly before
Every day's a constant struggle and you're a casualty of war
Which could only equal good, in fact
So love isn't lost, I know exactly where I put it at",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-castles-lyrics
Off 2 The Races,A Loose Quarter,2012.0,"And we're off to the races, places
Ready, set, the gate is
Down and now we're going in
To Las Vegas chaos, Casino Oasis
Honey, it is time to spin
Boy, you're so crazy, baby
I love you forever, not maybe
You are my one true love
You are my one true love

Let her know I’m here if she ever need me to be with her
As long as she know I can never be with her
She asks you why, I just need you to keep it G with her
Tell her I found a happiness that I could never see with her
Three years after that break up, should’ve had closure by now
We’d be best friends, you’da let this end, we’d be closer by now
But you want us upset, hostile, angry, evil, jealous, bitter, shit
Fuck makin' your bed and lyin' in it
You bought the house, live with it
I came to you for a second chance, you gave me your ass to kiss
Found another salad to toss, how the fuck is you mad at this?
Oh, I forgot, you not in love anymore
And I’d believe it, but see, I’m not on drugs anymore
That’s based on action; words I stopped believin', still I hear it though
Would you save them if you knew they became meaningless to me years ago?
But if happiness is the finish line, I beat you there
So Karma must be real 'cause since we broke up he ain’t treat you fair

And we're off to the races, places
Ready, set, the gate is
Down and now we're going in
To Las Vegas chaos, Casino Oasis
Honey, it is time to spin
Boy, you're so crazy, baby
I love you forever, not maybe
You are my one true love
You are my one true love

Remember our bad break-up? I rapped about it on ""Downfall""
But you know I don’t stay down for long
Remember you met that other dude
Who's smarter and more mature, with more bread
That you thought would be around for long?
Remember you pulled the rug from under me, left me to be alone?
I threatened suicide, begged, was crazy about you
But that stalker dude was deranged
To the point you wished death on his name
And when we speak now, you still say I’m crazy without you
My, my how the tables have turned
Or are they bendin' just a little? You resent it just a little?
'Cause dude that ruined your life made you doubt yours
It’s the reason that loneliness you gave me is now yours
Check it, in perspective I can’t even call it hatin'
You mad at the situation, really it ain’t even Kaylin
We both sympathized, that pain is felt and shared
To watch a man that you helped better display it elsewhere
Watch a man you spent years with, grew with
Come across as someone that you want nothin' to do with
To sleep in a bed with ""what ifs?"" instead of somethin' special
How can you get over us? The public won’t even let you
I know to wake up with that fear is gross
Love me from far 'cause you scared to get close
But what are you fearin' the most?
If happiness is the finish line, I beat you there
I always thought that when you’d put the baggage down I’d meet you there

And we're off to the races, places
Ready, set, the gate is
Down and now we're going in
To Las Vegas chaos, Casino Oasis
Honey, it is time to spin
Boy, you're so crazy, baby
I love you forever, not maybe
You are my one true love
You are my one true love
Uh, let’s bring it up to speed a lil' bit

Now a nigga ballin', you still tell me to grow some
Entertainin' threesomes,
 
you don’t think that it’s wholesome
Say that you can’t trust me, think I’m out here trashin' you
Got a lot of answers to questions I don’t be askin' you
I tried to be friends so I don’t see a problem passin' through
You welcome a nigga then paint it as me harassin' you
You must be misconstruin' my love and it’s gassin' you
Causin' you to wear our shit out and think it's fashionable
I'm thinkin' you should put our history in back of you
That would call for you steppin' outside of yourself and bein' rational
Come to friendship, you question me in that capacity
How would you ever know?
It’s not somethin' you ever asked of me
And VH1 just gave us another episode
So maybe it’s smart that you can’t let this go
'Cause love changes, a thug changes
And soulmates become strangers, word up

And we're off to the races, places
Ready, set, the gate is
Down and now we're going in

All Of Me,Mood Muzik Vol. 3.5 ,2007.0,"I give you my all, but it seems like that's not enough
Now you can get all of me
A lot of things have changed from what I see
Is this the way its supossed to be

Are you in that mood yet, one mo' 'gain
ARE YOU IN THAT MOOD YET
Look, they say tomorrow's not promised, but if it was I wouldn't get open
Wouldn't get souped, them shit's was made to be broken
'Member comin' up dudes talkin' 'bout hoes, boastin'
I was just a Juvenile movin in slow motion
I dropped outta school to be a dude with mad jewelry
Once I got it shit wasn't even cool to me
I dreamt of condos and video vixens
Until I learned most girls in videos is pigeons
I just wanted the world to see that I was for real with it
Wanted a deal, I got it and couldn't deal with it
I want me and my old homeboys to still kick it
I wish they saw me as Mouse and not a meal ticket
Let the beat play, I wish I could see a day wit no he say, she say, just wanna see Trey
Wanna play the hood and not fuck with the toasters
Middle child, wish me and my brother was closer
I wanna scream at her, catch myself before I start to
And then remember it takes two people to argue
All she do is provoke me, all I do is diss her
All I did was shake her, she say that I hit her
She just takin' everythin' I say out of context
I'm tryin' not to black, I'm like a nigga with a complex
Was mad as a fuck, didn't even show it
Yesterday was better off, didn't even know it
Complete role reversal so it's useless these days
TV got real, music went fake, please help her for God's sake
When I proposed to the game I figured life was merry
Five years later I'm feelin' like Tyler Perry
Maybe I'm exhausted, maybe I just lost it
Maybe I should pick up a pen and try n' force it
Same old story, guts and no glory
They tryna low ball me, do him like Joe Torre
I reintroduced myself to the world: I'm Jerz
I'm an artist, I paint pictures, I don't rhyme words
More than a rapper, I pay attention to detail
But how I do in retail tells me if I prevail
Leonardo ain't seen these trials and tribulations
Foul situations with some mild stipulations
I feel like being an addict is a curse
It's somethin' 'bout dude that makes bad shit worse
There's three types of niggas in this world, you know?
So you either gon' make shit happen (or)
Watch shit happen or (or,) not know what happened
So I couldn't just sit there like, fuck rappin'
It's dudes with problems I couldn't imagine havin'
If I had to have 'em I couldn't fathom me lastin', like
I used to bump into Tammy in the club
Few of them, she even helped a nigga get in
See a person long enough you know you bound to get fly wit 'em
Care for 'em, be more than ""hi"" and ""bye"" with 'em
Its been a while, I can't front like I ain't phased
She was my reality check, 'cause we the same age
I mean she put on a show that you can't stage
She made the shit sound effortless
I was damn near in tears checkin' my messages
I got goosebumps all over my skin
She said, ""Mouse, I highly doubt that I'll ever see you again""
Hope everything is well, kid
You see I'm just findin' out I have a brain tumor, but I never felt it
The doctor's giving me three weeks to live
Not three weeks 'til I die, that's three weeks to give
I just wanna tell you that I love you and I care
I wish you all the best throughout the rest of your career""
And then she broke into tears
I pressed seven, took the phone from my ears
Sometimes the simplest of things people need it
But I ain't call back in fear of being speechless
What was I to put her at ease with
I picked a real bad time to be strategic
I think my life's bad, picking up the pieces
Some folk already got they appointment to see Jesus
In this world full of diseases
I've learned not to bite my tongue or have seizures
Depression tells me I suck
So I reply, I ain't here 'cause I fell down, I'm here 'cause I got up
And then I'm goin' back and forth with Ransom
Shit came outta nowhere, was real random
According to him, I'm responsible for Jerz too
I never helped niggas, how the fuck you think they heard you
Motherfucka's got a lot of nerve, dude
I was the nigga believed in you spittin'
Had to con the industry just so they would listen
But go 'head, you just gon' rep yourself
How was you protecting me, you can't protect yourself
Keep the lies to a minimal, just read your interview
I can't help but ask what's gotten into dude
Media trainin' but he don't know how that go
It'd help you come across not soundin' like an asshole
In my past though been to jail, I ain't enjoy it
So why would I stand behind the mic and exploit it
I ain't ig'nant, just because I exercise spiritually
They try to ignore how I exercise lyrically
I thought I had a great job
Back when niggas loved the culture, wasn't in it for the money like a A-Rod
Even when I'm spitting 'bout current events
Its a sublime sayin', who's more current than him?
So I'm wonderin', if a higher power tryna under-man
When you shoot for the stars, sometimes your gun'll jam
I ain't been to Summer Jam
I learned from Lupe: when you dumb it down its just harder to understand
2008, foes is still near me
So you can think I'm tight as FUCK, I'm still weary
The Geto Boys say its all in the mind
Certain wounds only heal over time
No shame in my game, no pain, no gain
And since I ain't see a prophet I figured God would stop it
Waitin' on a alley, niggas just won't lob it
Still a risk taker let me put it in words
Can't steal second base and keep your foot on first
Been about ten years since I was high off the angel
Now I'm walkin' side by side with an angel
In front of my eyes that prize keep gettin' dangled
But can't grab at it, my pride is being strangled
Workin' shorty's nerves like a personal trainer
But its me, its personal, it ain't her
Friends keep tellin me leave her, I won't
Cause she sees somethin' in me that I don't
And I see somethin' in her that ya'll won't
If you never been in love don't tell me I'm wrong
See I preach gratitude, she keeps an attitude
Argue long enough and that shit becomes laughable
My norm now since for her it's so natural
Wish I could tell her that all them niggas after you
So not compatible, that we compatible
Its nothin' else in this world that we would rather do
Anybody out there relate to my pain
Turn the music up let me know that I'm sane
We broke up, bitches was starin' at my chain
Dude was fuckin' you but starin' at my name
But we ain't gotta entertain all that
Back like we never left, we overcame all that
Fuck who made better tacos or who's ass fatter
Let's live for now, right now, none of that matters
Keep bringin' it up its goin' backlash us
Why am I meeting so many back-stabbers?
Why when I'm about to crash I go faster? Past is a disaster
When your house is see through, learn to close your eyes
In case the Glass shatters
Just sayin', it's always a million more pages when my stupid ass keep
Thinkin' I'm on the last chapter
No tit for tat, I ain't equipped for that
Back in New York, chit chat with a Midget Mack
As I get older...I keep gettin' sick of rap
Wanna call it quits, but a nigga can't picture that...",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-all-of-me-lyrics

New Joe Budden!

Uhh
Please somebody help my soul
Please somebody help my soul
Please somebody help my soul
Please somebody help my soul
Talk to 'em (talk to 'em)

I let the Man have a talk with the beast in me
I'm holding onto my last bit of decency
I need a vacay, a change of scenery
But mama said wherever I'ma go, I'm taking me with me
I told her shit is on my mind and it's been eating me
She got me pissing in a cup, she don't believe in me
It's not the drugs that got me out of my zone
Going days without eating, in a crowd I feel alone, mama
Then she ask why it seems I never sleep at night
I told her when I close my eyes my brain just keeps the fight
She said my friends wanna have an intervention with me
I speak to niggas daily, that was never mentioned to me
She told me there's a higher power and a lower power
And that I'll die if I don't find the strength to overpower
Then I replied, ""well aren't we all""?
She said ""yeah, but that should be on God's terms, not yours""

My every thought is scary
And it makes it hard to breathe again
Like I'm blinded while I'm staring in the mirror
Asking God to help me see again, please help me
But He tells me I'm only human
And that I'll be back on my feet again, please help me
But they act like I'm more than human
I prove them wrong again
Don't fault me, I'm only human

Tryin' to weather the storm
I thought that black cloud was gone
It's been beside me all along, not the song
I wanna sit in silence, don't speak for a minute
Tired of being strong, please let me be weak for a minute
Kinda thought that my disease tried to kill your man first
It was easy to get my hands on 30 milligram Percs, worse
Can't be depression, couldn't have it this long
So many secrets I only told to a glass of Patron, my nigga
Speaking of secrets, that's when I got the Kaylin text
Read it and cried, couldn't believe what she was saying next
She said ""you're going through a lot
I'm hoping you ain't in the grave and dead
Cause not too many people know your brain's a mess""
Who knew that she was keeping track of it all?
I wrote back ""lol"" but wasn't laughing at all
I ain't tell her just the other day that that gun was in my lap
Pen and pad in my hand, and I was writing a note
Didn't get far, as soon as I wrote down ""mom"" I just stopped
Couldn't lie to her, couldn't figure out how to say bye to her
Couldn't explain the ""why"" to her
Couldn't picture her getting a call or somebody saying her son had died to her
And shortly after that my pastor called
Which at first I kinda thought it was weird
But that convo preserved me, 'bout God's grace and mercy
He ain't even say goodbye, he said ""let us pray""
And then he went into a prayer, gripped the phone, closed my eyes
Just so happy he appeared, nigga shed another tear
Maybe he could sense that something had the god devoured
Just thankful he shed some light upon my darkest hour
All my thoughts are corrupt, this shit is whack
If everybody calls you a duck, will you just quack?
Guess a part of me really gives a fuck, way in the back
Cause when I had that burner ready to bust, I didn't clap

My every thought is scary

But they act like I'm more than human
I prove them wrong again
Don't fault me, I'm only human

Guess I'm insanity's definition
Trying to step over in sanity's repetition
But I can't it got me tripping
Whatever love we had was dead that night
Looking back, we both needed cooler heads that night
Was going off no sleep, eyes red that night
While you was drunk texting me, I hope I read that right
You was beefing bout Giselle, beefing bout Alexa
Suddenly you was jealous, must've thought that I had sexed her
I was laughing, thought it was funny
Giselle's the homie, Alexa's twenty
With hip withdrawals
Nothing bout your story shoulda been sticking at all
I wouldn't dick her at all
I'm guessing, maybe you were insecure and never knew me
Was there for four months, yet you said this was a new me
In your head, guess the answer to this jealousy
Was to turn around and try to make me jealous, B
But the part that you neglect
Was never mind jealousy, this was 'bout respect
Y'all Instagramming pictures, trying to get me upset
You turned that into a night we both would never forget
We both said some things we both probably regret
You was lying to my face and them dots didn't connect, but cool
Only picked you up to try and talk sense into you
Now I'm fucking homeboy up, just off the principle
I guess he caught him self antagonizing me
But he's a young nigga, that's no surprising me
Shit I done fucked some of the baddest hoes
I left shorty weeks ago, you can have this ho
I guess the part where I lose
Is now they got my face plastered all over the news, I'm being falsely accused
And I don't understand, was this all part of a plan?
I guess I'll tell the whole truth when on the stand
How you go and tell the cops I had guns in my house?
Now they got a search warrant, just to come to my house
Question: were your feelings worth taking my tomorrow's, kid?
And 
you know Jersey gun laws, I'm talking hollow tips
So you can tell them niggas you roll with whatever you want
But you and I know what's going on
Nigga that whole night just replays in my mind
Your face is fine, this is a big waste of time
Let's get back to that jealousy
Now you got a nigga facing three felonies
All for what, cause we were no longer dealing
You attack me, but I'm the villain, over a fucking iPhone and feelings
Check, you never see me act like a jerk
I know women will provoke you and get mad when it works
Rather reserved and that always makes matters the worst
Cause I go on about my business and not act like it hurts, but wait
So now the whole world is watching me get burned here
Which is fine, there's a lesson to be learned here
Which is only fuck with strippers and the bartenders
Anytime there's a pole in the bar centered
So even though it's from afar now
I still wish you the best, I know your heart's tender
I'm sorry all, I just got my own scars to tend to
Signing off, truly yours, with love, God's sinner

My every thought is scary
And it makes it hard to breathe again
Like I'm blinded while I'm staring in the mirror
Asking God to help me see again, please help me
But he tells me I'm only human
And that I'll be back on my feet again, please help me
But they act like I'm more than human
I prove them wrong again
Don't fault me, I'm only human
My every thought is scary
And it makes it hard to breathe again
Like I'm blinded while I'm staring in the mirror
Asking God to help me see again, please help me

All In My Head,A Loose Quarter,2013.0,"Quarter on the loose
Loose Quarter
Few questions I ask myself

Maybe it started with Slaughterhouse, or was it tour life?
Maybe it wouldn’t had started at all if I had your life
Maybe it was needed, or was I thinkin' immorally?
If I wasn’t myself, could I say I gave the fans all of me?
Can’t decide if I’m more ashamed of what they saw of me
Than I am of ignorin' all the lessons that was taught to me
Headed up field but couldn’t dodge the last tackler
How could a forward thinker move so ass-backwards?
How could a dude with no regrets at all, willin' to bet it all
Not realize that quicker demise? How could I neglect it all?
I’m so seasonal, some of y'all knew I'd spring back
With a heart this cold, how'd y'all think I’d be receptive to fall?
I’m plenty comfortable when danger’s around
And even more so when strangers around
And the bigger picture is sicker
Don't know my triggers or know the alarm it forces
Don't know a nigga
Don't know my bouts with drugs and liquor or the harm it causes
Life or death, I tried to lynch myself
Thought I could keep it all a secret, I convinced myself
But really, the folk that loved me, they could tell I was locin'
I couldn’t see him cry me a river 'cause it fell in the ocean
Numb to my words now, maybe felt I was open
I cut so many people loose, do I need help with devotion?
That’s just some of the things I ask my Lord and Savior
And when He calls for me, will He have done us all a favor?

How did I make it here?
Who are y'all?
I feel so lost
Now I’m not seein' it clear
Is it my fault?
It’s all in my head

I’m lookin' around like this can’t be happenin'
Round of applause for the angry rappers
Lord, my girl cried me a flood, then me a river
That’s love, dependin' on me when I’m independent on liquor
I’m up in the shoe store, she got no love to show
You ever look at a bitch you was fuckin' behind your bitch back
Like, ""Fuck I was fuckin' you for?!""
I’m an artist so I’m intelligent
I would tell you to do some soul searching
But it’s hangin' up in my closet with your skeleton
It’s gotta be a God's work
Even a diamond gotta be polished first
A quarter's on the loose
And I ain’t been out here gettin' my dollars worth
I had to remove the goggles first
To see through the sippin' Patrón
And fifty phoners for I need to go get me a kidney donor
Guru, Nate Dogg,
 
go ahead blink a eye
The doctor told me, ""You close, go 'head drink and die""
Buried under the stone where the Patrón fifth sits by
That reads, ""Here lies somebody who never wanted to be this guy""

How did I make it here?
Who are y'all?
I feel so lost
Now I’m not seein' it clear
Is it my fault?
It’s all in my head

They say knowledge is power – great, 'cause every day I learn
As of late been havin' revelations 'bout this hate term
Hate the way they judged me 'til I got the case adjourned
Hated the belly of the beast 'til I became its tapeworm
When I said I’d stop gettin' high, tried to say it stern
Now I’m the type to walk through the fire to check the way it burn
They say my brain is off – I say, ""How can it be?
If I’m out my mind, how can I be in-sanity?""
The people used to say that I was scared of progress
They don’t know how hard a nigga tried to advance
But I don’t know who’s more to blame
Is it them for really not knowin' me?
Or is it me for never really givin' them a chance?
Get too close, be too big of a threat
Now it’s been little to no time, thinkin' why I ain’t get rid of you yet
Gotta recognize my maturity, gotta see I’m grown
Let all my skeletons out the closet just so I'd never be alone
Since I got trust issues I won’t discuss with you
Besides God, tell me who the fuck’s supposed to save you?
Pop won't have a man-to-man, was gone half my life
So somewhere in his head probably feel it ain't his place to
Plus more people will see me soon
I mean, I’ll be on national TV soon
So when I ask if people I have around are a cancer for me
That’s four million more that might be able to answer for me

How did I make it here?
Who are y'all?
I feel so lost
Now I’m not seein' it clear
Is it my fault?
It’s all in my head",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-all-in-my-head-lyrics
Broke,All Love Lost,2015.0,"We're broke, like skeletons, loving to the bone
Our heart's so delicate from hanging on too long
Nothing left to hide, nothing left to show
We're broke, like skeletons, loving to the bone

It's been a while, we ain't talk
We ain't seen each other
I guess that's how it's supposed to be
Maybe this is fake, maybe we'll never know

I mean, we started with love, the beginning was magical
Then it ended abrupt, how's it us that this happened to?
Was it all just a lie? How was none of it factual?
Even in our demise, it seems I'm always attached to you
They said: ""If you let it go, if it's real it comes back to you.""
She just called me a thief; I took it, never gave back to you
After all that I've done, figured you'd have some gratitude
Look how far we fell off, we can't even be casual
Guess we both had times we were being irrational
We both out of our minds, how are we not compatible?
Say I pushed you out the door, and you did what you had to do
Now you play the victim like I wasn't impacted too
Should be a movie star, ma, you so good at acting new
You like us as strangers, me, I think it's impractical

But she said that she deserves much better
For as long as she fought
Guess our bond wasn't as strong as I thought
We'll never know, come on

We're broke, like skeletons, loving to the bone
Our heart's so delicate from hanging on too long
Nothing left to hide, nothing left to show
We're broke, like skeletons, loving to the bone
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh… Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh…

I mean, we started with love, then we ended with hatred
The whole world in our business, clearly nothing was sacred
I know you down to your core, unless for years you just faked it
I know all of your flaws, see your soul when you naked
Now you got a new squad, all them bitches is basic
And even if they ain't, it ain't hard to mistake it
I think you running from love with me, you gotta face it
Are you guarding your heart
From a nigga that always breaks it?
Now you live in the club, maybe you tryna stay busy
You still call me every birthday to say that you miss me
You check to see who I'm with, ""Did anybody come after?""
But still talk like you the one, you say that none of them matter
I guess it is what it is, what about what it could be?
Do we try this again, just to confirm what it should be?

But she said that she deserves much better
For as long as she fought
I guess our bond wasn't as strong as I thought
We'll never know, come on

We're broke, like skeletons, loving to the bone
Our heart's so delicate from hanging on too long
Nothing left to hide, nothing left to show
We're broke, like skeletons, loving to the bone
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh… Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh…

I'm the one you hide
The one you can't forget
And you're the reason why
I lie awake in bed
You never felt so open
I never been so scared to death
We pushed so hard
'Til there was nothing left
Under my skin, gave what I had to give
We hit the end...

We're broke, like skeletons, loving to the bone
Our heart's so delicate from hanging on too long
Nothing left to hide, nothing left to show
We're broke, like skeletons, loving to the bone
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh… Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh…",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-broke-lyrics
You And I,No Love Lost,2013,"Feel like I have dated every woman in the world
Most were beautiful
Some were corporate
Worked in a little cubicle
I done some shit to some that I would never do to you
Cause some were tailor made but still wasn't suitable
Come to yours I see why you be elusive
Some took advantage off you, some were intrusive
Some put they hands on you, some were abusive
Most cheated on you must they think you were exclusive
Ain't gotta say a word, I already know it
Even if you scared to death it's ill that you never show it
I go to sleep with fear of losing you, don't wanna blow it
And I wouldn't be surprised if I did, that's typical Joe shit
I lie forever
Not only do she trust me, her body is a work of art
There's a beauty in every ugly
So for me as a friend though our past is so horrible
Together we'll never have to see em' again
I love you

You and I, you and I seem crazy
I would die, if you leave my life baby
No one else gave a damn 'bout us
Where we go, I don't know the future
I just know, I don't wanna lose ya
We just taking our chance on love, on love

I've been with every woman in this world, except a virgin chick
Some kept my soul alive just so they can murder it
We're both broken pieces, both been hurt and shit
Both took a chance on each other and it was worth the risk
She low maintenance but she deserves a grip
Give her the best of me cause she endured the worst of it
She been through so much, still she carry on
So if she comes with baggage, it's a carry-on
So in life without, I couldn't conceive
I tried to dump her one time, but she wouldn't leave
And I ain't want her to, so that was good to see
Soon as I uttered the word I damn near couldn't breathe
Been trough the run around, took her off the carousel
Still in shock that her passion's unparalleled
I know some exes must be mad as hell
But we were so broken down, we had to gel
I love you

You and I, you and I seem crazy
I would die, if you leave my life baby
No one else gave a damn 'bout us
Where we go, I don't know the future
I just know, I don't wanna lose ya
We just taking our chance on love, on love

I've been with every type of woman, some of the baddest ones
Some were cougars, but still they acted young
Some were gossip queens, but I ain't mad at them
You make bittersweet, today that shit matters none
Some I knew wouldn't last when that crash begun
Some played it cool, but wasn't half as fun
Some ain't over me, they just blame away
Some I ruined myself, others came that way
Some were modelesque, left, started gaining weight
Other waited to gain, but met the same fate
Some moved to the city for a change of pace
Some I never broke up with, just let it fade away
Some never witnessed love, don't know what we see in it
Was a stranger for you, so it's ill how you believe in it
Cause you done dated a few
If I'mma take a chance on love, I thank God he let me take it with you
I love you

You and I, you and I seem crazy
I would die, if you leave my life baby
No one else gave a damn 'bout us
Where we go, I don't know the future
I just know, I don't wanna lose ya
We just taking our chance on love, on love",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-you-and-i-lyrics
Love I’m Good,All Love Lost,2015.0,"To my dear dearly departed
Shit's becomin' all that I feared, here's where it started
Seems that nothing's as it appears, swear it's retarded
No wonder I get speared by my peers, yeah I'm a target
It used to take a nation of millions for niggas not to be
AmeriKKKa's Most gave America hope
Back when the music had a message in it
We was rebels against it
The best was intended to lessen the gimmicks
But now y'all made a mess of it
And somebody gotta address this shit
Rakim would never wear a dress and shit
I ain't a pessimist to say I ain't impressed with it
Your hearing's bad, you think it's alive, now that's the death in it
When it was all about bars, wanted to weddin' it
Surround yourself with bullshit, you'll be liable to step in it
Came here with one objective, gettin' it further
Now I'm watchin' my first love die, witnessin' murder
When Common stopped lovin' ol' girl, what was he tellin' me?
Cold world, now she won't dig you without a melody
Love nerds, used to be into niggas with felonies
We need a new president, where the fuck is Eric B?
Or did my wordplay confuse her?
Now I see her with Young Thug and Future
Like what did you niggas do to her?
Now, my generalization is this generation
The imminent state of this gentrification, desensitization
I call her, she's in Marvin's room, everything is awkward now
She moved more to south, deserted her New Yorker crowd
Met her with a cane, she changed, prefer to walk it out
Stopped eatin' meat when she heard I worked in a slaughterhouse
Now she's a new dame glued to the fame
She used to hate accessorizin', now she's wearin' two chains
Relationship too strained, I don't know who to blame
When I tell her, ""You changed"", she say, ""Who would be the same""
She right... cause this ain't the way we knew each other
Or do I face the fact that maybe we outgrew each other?
It took a while, but that's finally understood
She wouldn't change if she could
I swear if this is love, I'm good

Everything has changed, I can see it clear in fact
Starin' at these four walls, angry that they're starin' back
Took a while, now it's finally understood
Would we change it if we could?
I swear if this is love, I'm good

Look, I can't get with you at all, our issue is tall
You tied to every nigga now that dribbles a ball
Did I miss a red flag? You wasn't fickle before
I can't even ridicule y'all, that'd be a bitter resolve
Wanna talk about our history
I feel like everything you say is contradictory
Whenever you come visit me
I look at you and see remembrance, remnants
Plenty resentments, it's not you but there's resemblance
We diss each other all out of fun, shit amuses me
You threaten every girl I'm with, that just confuses me
Say you want kids real soon, now that's abuse to me
And I just write about it in song, you're like a muse to me
I wanna ask where you see yourself in five years
How you goin' about that, like what's the verdict?
I wanna ask if you ever replay the past over
And if you do, when you finished is it worth it?
I wanna ask if we love each other so much
How do we cause each other so much pain?
Still in all in each others lives
We've remained without a claim
I know some'll call that clinically insane
How do we remedy the games?
Was once enemies and then that energy refrained
Wasn't meant to be, the synergy had us mentally drained
Minimally sprained so relentlessly he aims
Despite when you said you never could depend on me again
Still we're here as none of this had ever taken place
Are we checkin' to see if someone's takin' our place?
As we front like we're takin' up space
I think currently the current we is makin' our case
But for what? Would that just seal it again
Did it all hurt so much? Do we wanna feel it again? I doubt it
Took a while, still nothing's understood
Would we change it if we could?
I swear if this is love, I'm good

Everything has changed, I can see it clear in fact
Starin' at these four walls, angry that they're starin' back
Took a while, now it's finally understood
Would we change it if we could?
I swear if this is love, I'm good

Look, I can see the pain in your eyes, I wanna fix it
But all your words are fuelin' my pride, so I'm dismissive
You think I wanna sit in this courtroom
Talkin' supervised, scrutinized by suit and ties? You a lie
You could cry, the conditions of you and I, can't escape it
Every lie she told you over the years, I'm face to face with
And now they manifested
You're overwhelmed and congested
But feelin' neglected, I gotta respect it
I can't explain to your so young brain
Since our first exchange you've been kept from me
Used against as weaponry
And as much as I hate her
I'd never downplay your mother like that
For you to judge her like that
Just a lesson later on that you'll discover like that
We not alone in this process, no, it's others like that
But you spew these sly remarks like, ""Why are we here?
Like why are you near? Like why do you care, how is this fair?""
I gotta eat that, see you got a grudge, lil' nigga
We flesh and blood, lil' nigga, no ifs, ands or buts, lil' nigga
You can think your dad is nuts, lil' nigga
I'm talkin' to you cause you came out of my nuts, lil' nigga
That's my stance on the matter, I won't budge, lil' nigga
And I'll tell that to your mother and the judge, lil' nigga
At our next court date, you gon' see that it's true
Funny, my condescendin' ways, I kinda see 'em in you
Mannerisms when I'm annoyed, yep I'm seein' that too
I'm smilin', admirin' genes, I kinda think that it's cute
I was you 20 years ago when pop popped up
But nothin' like you, sad how life'll recycle a cycle
You missin' intel only a dad can give
Can't expect you to understand, this doesn't matter to a kid
And since our situation's not understood
I would fix it if I could
I swear if this is love, I'm good

Everything has changed, I can see it clear in fact
Starin' at these four walls, angry that they're starin' back
Took a while, now it's finally understood
Would we change it if we could?
I swear if this is love, I'm good",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-love-im-good-lyrics
In My Sleep,Padded Room,2009.0,"Baby girl told me in my sleep I was talkin
So it's only natural I asked her what I said? (said)
She said she woke up when she heard
But she was so damn tired she couldn't make out a word"" (out a word)
She said she was tryin to see if eventually I would scream the name of a bird (bird)
I told her that's absurd ('surd), and then gave her the face like ""word?"" (word)
And then she replied yeah, said it was quite weird, said she was type scared
I said ""that's a side effect that you get
When you trade bad dreams for some great nightmares"" ('mares)
When I close my eyes (eyes), I escaped the Poltergeist
My escape from reality, just what I needed
Brings me to a place where shorty never cheated (hey!)
And even if she tried and succeeded
In this other world I wouldn't even get heated
Fuck (fuck) the details, I don't care about why
I'm chillin' with my grandmother, she ain't die
I was browsing online and seen Mike on a banner
That said ""you can be like me and beat cancer""
Anything I touched I'd feel (feel)
Know it’s fiction, but it seemed so real
Was leavin' out the casino with a nympho
Yes, Rae,
 
it can be so simple (oh)
Here's how I avoid a problem with my kinfolk
Learnt how to build me a house with no win—dows
And that's when I think I saw a ribbon in the sky but it wasn't from an in-tro
'Cause where I'm at is no rumors or gossip but still got love for Ms. In-fo
She said in my sleep I'd be laughin, but shit be funny to me (oh)
Look, my ice cream was two hundred degrees
If it dripped, I'd get a hole in my dungarees
See, my anonymity is my protection (what else?)
And me and hip-hop have no connection (what else?)
Which got me to reflectin, is that why the mirror won't show my reflection?
When I close my eyes, there's no dollars
So we can scratch that one as an excuse (or)
Or why folks do the things they do (or)
Or why people act so brand new (let's go)
I had wings on flyin out a prison with a ratchet
Was only there cause someone snitched
Look (look here), no one's poor but no one's rich
Just my way of creepin if life's a bitch
Took a walk on the ceiling just to get my mind right
That was yesterday (so), so in hindsight
Since I was able to haul off
I took it as God tellin me I'll never fall off (off)
Got rid of name brands in the jewelry (why?)
Most people just use it as medicine
Like it take 'em somewhere they ain't never been (but)
But here you better off not better than (oh!)
Stuck in the room with a elephant
Opened the closet and dapped up my skeleton
Had a convo with a man with no ears
And all of a sudden everything became so clear (clear)
Have no fear, I just bought a first class trip to nowhere - everybody goes there
But they don't stay the whole year, me? I got three hundred and sixty-five shows there
My girl said in my sleep, I'd be walkin (walkin), so I ask baby, where I go?
Uh, she said I be walkin slow
But she don't ever want to get out of bed, so she don't know
I went to see a man walkin on water (and)
Asked if he'd ever get things back in order (and)
I've been there two years, over a quarter
But everytime I open my eyes, it's like torture (torture)
He said ""please, I gave you a whole 'nother world for you to go do with as you please
Just so you appeased, mixed with a couple of signs about real life while you make believe""
So I (so I), teleported out of there with a grin
Met a bum with a mansion, invited me in
Then (then), we politiced, about politics
Said somethin about Def Jam, I ain't acknowledge it
I went to see a virgin with AIDS, yeah I thought about smashin that (why?)
Yeah her ass was fat
So appealin, tattoo on her inner thigh said
""she doin better than she was feelin"" (feelin)
I think I seen shorty before (like), maybe in a club or somethin
Or, maybe in VIP, but wasn't nobody there but me
And the club was all red (red)
Then she started playin with my head (my head)
And then I came
Then I asked shorty, ""what's her name?""
And it was weird cause she fucked around, disappeared (uh, 'peared)
Like what a cruel joke (look)
Cig lit but from it was no smoke
Flicked in the ash tray and seen Stack's face
Flash through a school hallway on a half day
Was gettin chased, couldn't tell by who (or)
Then a hallway turned into a cliff (what else?)
Screamin' piff before I was dead
Somehow I jump my ass up out that bad
Then baby girl told me in my sleep, I was screamin (screamin)
So I said that's a lie (that's a lie)
She put her right hand in the sky and said ""you was, but I don't know
Why, got to go, goodbye"" (goodbye, goodbye ...)",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-in-my-sleep-lyrics
Cut From a Different Cloth,A Loose Quarter,2012.0,"Look at me, King!
Look at me, King!
Soul
Kaylin on the couch sleepin'
She wake up, she gonna be like damnnnn

Come and spar with a titan
If you ain't knew it's true I'm Zeus and I marvel at lightning
What a marvelous sight, 
know the thought is enticin'
Flow stupid like 50 Tyson, don't trip with 50 Cent
I beat 'em all like Tyson, that's no coincidence
Ab-Soul, don't forget the hyphen, I might throw a fit
You think I lived in the Salvation Army but all it is
Is that we got a new 2Pacalypse Now
(When?) Before the apocalypse
Wow, how do you come up with this?
If you behind Ab, then maybe you can stomach this
Who could fuck with it?
I know you got a dick, but use your head, bruh
They sleepin' on me by a colony of bed bugs
Cut from a different cloth and no one knows my thread count
My mind is like a sword, you'd swore I'd have a hair cut
Soul and Budden, no discussion
Joe, you know it's nothin'
Wrote the score, and then I scored,
 
metaphor, and 1

I don't know about you, hey, I don't know about them
I just do what I do, they just do what they can
They be hatin' on the man, with a knife in their hand
Cut from a different cloth, cut from a different cloth
All these niggas on my dick, all these bitches on my balls
Cut from a different cloth, cut from a different cloth
Middle fingers to the fakers, middle fingers to 'em all

Y'all can hold the applause
I just did what these other niggas was scared to do
Tell me life is hard, I'll ask: ""What the fuck do you compare it to?""
Quarter on the loose, I'm blessed enough that I can spare a few
Told me I'd be dead, the fact I'm breathin' is a miracle
Y'all got Gollum, listenin' to all these dudes that y'all call lyrical
Excludin' under conclusion that you young and you dumb
If that's how they appear to you
I'd be lyin' if I said your words ain't bother me
Be lyin' if I ain't think it was trickery or reverse psychology
I came in on Rakim, watched y'all take the bar, y'all lowered it
Won't stay in line like a battered wife
Ain't too many spots y'all can go with it
How long y'all gonna febreeze manure
And think the fans won't notice it?
Nah, I ain't get angrier, but the chip on my shoulder did
Not to gloat, if I ain't one of the G.O.A.T.S.
Y'all probably missed my track record
Either that or y'all just ain't been keepin' track of records
I've just been waitin' till that sentiment passed
Y'all ain't even gotta be drunk to feel this genuine draft
I'm lettin' Benjamins stack
Shouldn't be hard to tell if the boy is potent
I'm the only time you'll see a madman be void of emotion
'Cause they fear me in any cypher the hear me in
Only rappin' with Soul for the outer body experience
So hats off, y'all fit for this, but y'all the type we laugh at
I'm way ahead, and when I aim for yours
Somethin' tells me he won't snap back
All I ever been was a outcast
This time in the moment I moved past that
But the burner name is Jackson and your alias is Baghdad
BLAT! It's not a game, try to execute
2K'D my old bitch, know I keep a ex to shoot
If anyone tried to do the math they'd probably be mad as fuck
Said I'd never amount to shit, now they tryin' to add it up

I don't know about you, hey, I don't know about them
I just do what I do, they just do what they can
They be hatin' on the man, with a knife in their hand
Cut from a different cloth, cut from a different cloth
All these niggas on my dick, all these bitches on my balls
Cut from a different cloth, cut from a different cloth

Skeletons,No Love Lost,2013.0,"I got some skeletons locked in the closet (Yeah, yeah)
And I've been dyin', dyin' just to find an outlet
And I'm hoping that no one finds out about it (Yeah, yeah)
Wishing maybe it'll disappear but I doubt it
I doubt it

I look over my shoulder not knowing where it's comin' from
But knowing that its coming, I was bugging as a youngin'
Now I'm runnin' from something that'll even out my dumb decisions
The night I shot and had him bleeding out his lungs and spitting
Do any sins go unforgiven? I hope not
'Cause most of mine were hunger driven,
 
nothing in my mother's kitchen
Stomach sounds like the clouds ignited and the thunder hittin'
So the well-screwed kid ended up with more than a couple missin'
So not a chef but now the cocaine forever cookin'
I love kids but now I'm selling to a pregnant woman
Stumbling through the projects in the AM with a cup in my hand
Gun on my waist and ""I don't give a fuck"" is my plan
You'll never understand my palm sweat
Followed by shortness of breath then my heart jets and I ain't find a calm yet
Go on, let shorty sing
'Cause ain't no way in hell this ain't Joell, that's brave enough to tell you everything

I got some skeletons locked in the closet (Yeah, yeah)
And I've been dyin', dyin' just to find an outlet (Yeah)
And I'm hoping that no one finds out about it (Yeah, yeah)
Wishing maybe it'll disappear but I doubt it
I doubt it

Fuck all that rappin', I'ma let the conversation rock
I got skeletons in my closet
The living dead live in a nigga head, behind a combination lock
When will the occupation stop and make it a vacant lot?
The black mamba when I crack vodka, I'ma take a shot
And hope them stowaways go away before the anchor drop
Yo, thanks a lot, I'm a bottle-drinking nutcase
Cover of XXL behind Em, I had the drunk face
I steadily dream about cleaning these demons out
In order to clean them out, you gotta scream and shout
All of your secrets out loud
It started as a kid at my school desk
Aced every quiz but I wanted to pass the cool test
Ain't nothing cool about school shopping at the thrift store
And living in an abandoned station wagon because you was piss poor
So I started stealing all of the clothes that the other kids wore
That's when the skeletons moved into my mind on the sixth floor
And more came through Crooked I's youth
I slowly started moving them out my closet into this mic booth
For real, bro

I got some skeletons locked in the closet (Yeah, yeah)
And I've been dyin', dyin' just to find an outlet (Yeah)
And I'm hoping that no one finds out about it (Yeah, yeah)
Wishing maybe it'll disappear but I doubt it
I doubt it

I thought I had it all locked away 'til forever
But no memories fade away, they seem to stay
Comfortable in my conscience you live in my dreams
They say time heals it all then why's the pain still with me?

Uh
See the problem is, I know it all
Or maybe the problem is that I just show it all
Maybe they that thinking I should be ashamed of my actions but really there's no remorse
Maybe the Lord will decide that I suffered enough and let me live with no withdrawals
Then again all it would mean is he deemed I'm much too important to focus on
We could talk about pain 24/7 dog, that’s my department
Inter city blues cruise and I’m blasting that Marvin
Skeletons ain’t in my closet, that’s my apartment
And they like to hide behind thousand dollar fabrics and garments
It's all bleak to me, tell my Pop, I ain't bothered
When he don't speak to me, I love you but it’s weak to me
On one hand life is short and there's no excuse to do it
But you was missing half my life dog, I'm kind of used to it
Modern day Son of Sam,
 judge but you don’t understand
Me against the world, I plan on winning, know I'm undermanned
Want to see through the eyes of a monster? Look through my glasses tint
My roommates can stay here, just take care of half the rent

I got some skeletons locked in the closet (Yeah, yeah)
And I've been dyin', dyin' just to find an outlet (Yeah)
And I'm hoping that no one finds out about it (Yeah, yeah)
Wishing maybe it'll disappear but I doubt it
I doubt it",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-skeletons-lyrics
Different Love,Some Love Lost,2014.0,"It go, off with my sabbatical
Took a few years 'cause Slaughter's what I had to do
 (What up?)
Which only brings me to now, and I oughta be erratical
I say that 'cause my autobiographical is more so just a graph of you
I ain't mad, you did more than what I asked of you
As for me, I did less than what I could've
So though we were a hit had to cancel that show
And now my standards so low I be amped when she not a hoe
But what you doing right now is real commendable, takes strength to do
'Cause between us there's some deep roots there
I gave you the best dick you ever got in your life
And stupid me thought it would be enough to keep you there
I thought you loved football, I was running through the hole with the stiff arm
But got disarmed, guess it was just harm
I ain't need to fuck, I was looking for a peer
They say once you stop looking what you looking for appears
You were stronger than I pictured you, much stronger than me
And almost just as strong as John
And John, oh, that's just a friend of my moms
With tubes coming out his nose, but shit I never knew why
But he was born with his heart on the right side of his chest
No, for real, his heart's in the right side of his chest
 (Word)
Doctors confused, ain’t much that they can do
But impute and say it ain't on the right side of his chest
Scared he might die in his sleep, deep
Every time he cough wonders if it's a cough or it's a symptom
Us, we'll get better later
He gon' live his whole life waking up every morning to a respirator
So I don't never say what I can't do
If he can be happy with life than nigga I can too (Fuck it, I can too)
While José wanna die
Ain't tell nobody, but eyeing his eyes feel I should probably identify
Said everyday he lives with pain and wanna end it
Something's wired wrong in your brain, you gotta mend it
Had a bad breakup and let it expose dude
But if she was getting you high then she would get you low too
So who's there to wait on me?
Y'all just get it off, y'all've put the weight on me
Nigga look me in my eyes, it was amazing to me
And said she don't understand, you not as crazy as me
You got gall, nigga, I'm the most mentally flawed nigga
You not even built to withstand all I've endured, nigga
You know shit about the thoughts in my head
Or the strength I need daily just to get out of bed
Just to open my eyes, nigga, open your eyes
The words spoken of wise, you just know it in disguise
We can end this right here, I got nuttin' more to say to ya
You ain't never met another fucking nigga crazier
Blank stare, couldn't believe 'em
Cat chastised me 'cause I got help when you need some
I could give less than a fuck and not a damn
I never be apologetic over who I am
I'm the same me, nothing changes when the riches do
But niggas wanna suck you dry just like the bitches do
They enter your mentions, 
sucks to be the center of attention
When you can't even center your attention
Yeah, so I'm fucking out of frustration
They love every second and accuse me of persuasion
Jam was a cancer to me, I had to rid it
Red got in her feelings fast, but won't admit it
Dawn I was bored then, never really smithen
V got threatened by the thought of competition
Malo wanna fuck all day, don't know how
She why I got a Viagra in my wallet right now
Steph kept it simple, loved me for my mental
B got a nigga, but she used me as her rental
And you, you just give me resistance
Say you need a comfort zone, for you it's distance
I tell 'em all I'm not available emotionally
They start giving me advice like they coaching me
I don't even ask it, it's something 'bout
Bipolar sociopath shit, they just find it attractive
Anti-social, but I mingle now
But I've been arguing much more since I've been single, how?
Tell me is this a relationship or just a fuckship?
Whatever situation it is it's all fuck shit
I'll admit, I might love a lil differently
As for them, they'd all love to see a different me
Some cried to me, some are begging for it
Some wanna see that change, but not be present for it
You just act so frightened
Ignoring all logic, now she won't buy in
Even in your absence my feelings are heightened
Though I know some love's lost, it's not on my end

It's not mine, it's not mine at all",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-different-love-lyrics
Playing Our Part,All Love Lost,2015.0,"Mic, mic, mic
Yeah we good now
Turn the vocals down a little bit, just a little bit
I want it loud

Here's my moment of clarity
I've been misleadin' you all, givin' you half of me
I've been blazin' a trail and leavin' casualties
I've diagnosed myself, I think it's apathy
So lettin' go became easy, grabbin' ahold that's the hardest
I know our expiration date soon as we start it
You come around and you feel safe while you're a target
You feelin' like I let you inside, while I'm guarded
It's genius when arrogance seems like it's modest
Look past the insanity, glance at the logic
Appears optional, all of it is stipulated
Watch and learn how emotions get manipulated
Now you in dire need of help
You the victim, made to think you did it to yourself
Speakin' of, rest in peace Sandra Bland
Me I'm believin' everything that wasn't on that cam
But back to you, beauty, let me address our lil' movement
You in therapy but I don't see the improvement
Oh whatever's been made now days is ruined
So every few months I ponder what the fuck are we doin'
Let me watch my words again
You easily got one of the best pussies that I've ever been inserted in
You real kind, real sweet, real nurturin'
Yet every time we link back up, you just get hurt again
You put all men in a box, I ain't one of 'em
Funny how you got all the answers and none of 'em
You only dated three men so I'm scared of you
Cause with no point of reference, what the fuck are you comparin' to?
You good one minute, psycho the next
No longer lettin' it ride, too much Jekyll and Hyde
Then you subtweet for weeks, busy settin' your pride
I'm grown, don't really need that sort of mess in my life
But wait, you of age, you old too
I control my emotions, yours control you
You bright enough to know when you get impulsive
For me, that's repulsive, how do you not know this?
And then we go our separate ways
Just to link back on better days
Though I know it's short term and you never stay
You always a sucker for that text that say

""Yo what up? Are you good?
Hit me up whenever you in the hood""
Then we fuck, and it's fine
Then you get all this bullshit on your mind
I'm waitin' for you to talk, but you won't
Then you wait for me to react but I don't
Then you go, and I watch
We know how this movie go, but we watch

Cause we just playin' our parts
You're watchin' how I perform and it's breakin' your heart
You home alone backtrackin', replayin' the start
You realize this whole script you've been playin' a mark
That ain't stop you from takin' a part
I guess we're both just playin' our parts

Yeah, and so the pussy ain't enough now
They keep thinkin' it should be enough, how?
Fuck sex, baby, later for that
This mind game I'm playin' is a greater climax
Not a franchise player, I can't pay you the max
I can't say it to you so I just say it in raps
I got a rep that I made all by myself
One I hate all by myself
That comes from decisions created all by myself
I can't shake it all by myself
See I grew up in the spotlight
Where your every move is eyed
The truth becomes lies when you're that scrutinized
No mentorship, I was unsupervised
Had to learn on my own every rule to survive
Still I manned up in caught those wrongs
Go ahead and judge Joe, I got my court clothes on
Y'all see the front, behind the scenes more goes on
Check my back catalog, it's in all those songs, forreal
So I can be at peace forever
I left the puzzle right there, nigga, piece it together
But back to you, beauty, small waist, fat booty
It's cool for the moment but don't permanently move me
They come through tossin' me ass like it's their duty
But who I was ain't who I am, I say it truly
Here I am shootin' 'em down without the Uzi
Unlike them niggas you know, don't try and group me
Watched myself on TV, was unruly
How the fuck they cast me wrong in my own movie
They say you are what you attract
Here I am, screamin', ""fuck all that""
Then I'm forced to believe I attract and adore
Bunch of unstable broads with character flaws
With plenty luggage, I greet 'em with their bags at the door
If that's true then it's some shit I'd rather ignore
Cause check it, whatever helps you get by
So when they hit me, I always reply

They always be like, ""what's up? Are you good?
Hit me up whenever you in the hood""
Then we fuck, and it's fine
Then you get all this bullshit on your mind
I'm waitin' for you to talk, but you won't
Then you wait for me to react but I don't
Then you go, and I watch
We know how this movie go, but we watch

Cause we just playin' our parts
You're watchin' how I perform and it's breakin' your heart
You home alone backtrackin', replayin' the start
Realize this whole script you've been playin' a mark
But that ain't stop you from takin' a part
I guess we're both just playin' our parts

Just where I'm at lately
Look at the monster this industry done made me
Shit I loved the most, I let it jade me
Cryin' out for help, somebody save me
But I can't let 'em know all that
They take it as weakness when you show all that
So I just live in my mind 'til this hoe call back
Every time I'm knocked down you see Joe crawl back, forreal
Nowadays they all the same
Enhanced body parts, smaller brains
They don't get a hi in fact
Mums the word, baby girl, it's now quiet for that, forreal
If you got nothin' to offer
Sorry Mrs. Jackson, gotta off ya
But as soon as you leave 'em alone
It's when they send that same text to the phone

They always be like, ""what's up? Are you good?
Hit me up whenever you in the hood""
Then we fuck, and it's fine
Then you get all this bullshit on your mind
I'm waitin' for you to talk, but you won't
You wait for me to react but I don't
Then you go, and I watch
We know how this movie go, but we watch
Cause we just playin' our parts
I guess we're both just playin' our parts
I play mine well
Better than you
And it go... baby, baby!",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-playing-our-part-lyrics
Momma Said,A Loose Quarter,2012.0,"Here we are, all alone
Who gives a fuck about what they say?
I'm sure I've heard much worse
People need to worry about them first
People need to learn to mind their business instead of mine
Here we are, all alone
Who gives a fuck about their dismay?
But still I'm face-to-face
With the one person I can't replace
One person I can't just tell I'm doin' fine

What up, Ma?
Been a while
Lot of catchin' up to do
Know you got a ear full
I'm listenin'

Momma said she loves me, said she cares
Said if I need her, she'll always be there
But even her sayin' that struck me as weird
Why did she feel those words I needed to hear?
Said she understands me, that was rare
'Cause no one understands me, not even my peers
And these just thoughts I never bother to share
So as I write, my eyes start to tear
I ain't tell her I'm tired, but still troopin'
Alone but I find myself regroupin'
Ain't say my brain now feel like a prison
Figured I'd shut the fuck up and listen
She continued, that was honorable
She said I get more and more irresponsible
For normal folks, she said that's a challenge
Luckily I mask mine behind talent
She said: ""You are no longer yourself
I don't know what to expect of you.""
Said I'm puttin' up with things I normally wouldn't
She don't know why it's acceptable
She said: ""People livin' in your house
Don't pay shit, not respectable.""
I told her they're folk I think highly of
She said: ""Well, they must think less of you
Must feel entitled, all you doing.""
I said I'll fix it, she said: ""No, you won't.""
Then I got defensive but still replied
I told her I need them, she said: ""No, you don't.""
Then she said: ""When's the last time you spoke to your father?""
I said he's self-centered, why bother?
'Cause he only really call about his needs
And I ain't got enough time to deal with his greed
'Cause my days are darker
Cut from a long shank but the blade is sharper
I'm makin' my not-so-vague departure
Tell pop I'm his son, not his Spades partner
Last time that we spoke
He wanted to use the crib, throw a party here
Which wasn't partly fair
My home need to feel like home even if I throw a party here
Then he catch an attitude
And I catch one right back at you
We adore each other but ignore each other
Think this is how the fuck I wanna act with you?
Things just ain't the same
But he sure will call about a Yankee game
Like, ""Call C.C. and get back to me.""
What's ill is he say it so casually
I love him so much he can have all the perks
Hurts so much I take all the Percs
Hurts so much, but fuck it, it works
Hurts so much that I can't sleep
Mom say I need to sleep more
Then again, she ain't on this stress level
So many people rely on me
I'm tryin' to get us all to the next level
Wait, told her I took baby girl to the doctor
It was only for a check-up though
And she gave me the face like, ""Now would be time
If there's anything I feel, I need to let her know.""
But that's just Mom again, just bein' a mom again
Looked down at the tat on my arm again
God, please give me the strength, keep calm again
She asked me if Kaylin was pregnant
I looked at her like she was crazy
'Cause that's my baby, what's wrong with a baby?
She said: ""Nothin' at all when you're not datin' a baby
Beautiful girl, I like everything about her thus far
I just don't wanna see you fall
Just a tad bit young, so she got some growin' up to do.""
And I replied: ""Don't we all?""
Momma said: ""Why can't you ever be alone?""
I said: ""What do you mean?""
Went to correct her, she did it herself
She said: ""At least that's how it seems.""
Pop ain't called, he's still mad
Still pissed, he's still angry
I'm still goin', no plan of slowin'
No way I'll ever let his immaturity taint me
Momma said that Tahiry called
That ain't shock me, they speak a lot
She's helpful and knowin' my ex…",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-momma-said-lyrics
Black Cloud,Mood Muzik 4: A Turn 4 The Worst,2010,"Nothing stays the same forever
Not even me
Uh, uh
Check this, check It

Something must’ve changed me, niggas might defame me
But things that used to taint me, no longer seem to restrain me
Strangely I’m no longer sad, mad or angry
Shame-ably it pains me, feeling like it just ain’t me
Mainly what do I tell all the people that thank me
Namely those who ordain me, aside from can you blame me
Motivation the ""Game"" was supplying me it's no longer providing me
Jason Williams something killed whatever was driving me
Worrying less about the past more about the now
Less about what I’m going through more about the how
It’s for certain spent 30 years being fit for hurdling
Now I’m a different person with nothin' to overcome and I miss the burden
For certain, got 6 figures in my sock drawer
And honestly this year I expect to make a lot more
It’s hard to live without a budget when life is corrupted
In a house that's so peaceful that I’m trying to disrupt it
Scream fuck it not because I have to but because I love it
Which makes me as fake as the puppets that I speak of disgusted
Without a paddle up shit’s creek
Dig deep and see it ain’t life it’s just me
So be warned as I’m putting on like I’m reformed
Only so y’all can accept it as being my norm
Maybe I quit working on me, maybe I given up
Maybe I been lying to myself maybe I give a fuck

It’s enough to make you black out, pull a Mac out
Aim it at the sky while I’m running from the black cloud
Every day we playing cat-and﻿-mouse
As I watch it hovering over my glass house
It’s enough to make you spazz out, pull a Mac out
Aim it at the sky while I’m running from a black cloud
Tired enough for me to pass out, tired of running from the black cloud

I say it loud hoping someone can hear me clearly
Trying to make my girl get it she don’t know that it’s very scary
But she’s a nympho she can be barely near me
She still want the God in her, think she Mary Mary
The prettiest bitches just want to service me
While niggas' prettiest bitches wouldn’t get a word from me
Some of you haven’t heard from me, some of you wouldn’t mind murking me
Find that news funny likes its straight from Ron Burgundy
These niggas ain’t never seen dough
They can dream though I bump into ‘em in between shows
People say I'm Emo, what that really mean though
Is though the song can’t breathe I actually make it seem so
I lost loved ones because they couldn’t deal with me
Cherish whoever still with me though the merit's been killed in me
Normally it’s just me and my lonely mind
Everyone storm is different so this forecast is only mine
Fans recognize my misery uplifted me
Shifted me to my epitome, guess the curse is a gift to me
Maybe its serendipity, maybe it’s weighing on me physically
Maybe I should man up and tell God not to solicit me
Been medicated, meditated, sedated, hated
Character assassinated, all theses years I masqueraded
Hard headed, if it was on my mind I had to say it
Tongue on the devil’s pitchfork to see how disaster tasted
Rap is fabricated, rappers are so exaggerated
Wouldn’t be scared of the truth if they weren’t castrated
Grab a mag, spray it, surrounded by people that shoot it before me
That'll unconditionally love my beautiful ugly
Now lemme speak to who I cater to
Would you love me the same if all my weeks were not favorable
Promised to maintain being unique but relate-able
All while suffering from a disease that can do away with you
Poetry on the beat, spoken-word for the masses
Therapy over Pro-Tools, every word is on acid
Consonants on Kush, every vowel is blunted
Highly wanted this whole organization privately funded
This is bigger than the Eiffle, this is alert the public
Had coppers bar our tunnels and our bridges with the rifles
Sentences meant to stifle, this is a man aching
This is the dam breaking, contraband in the making
This is panic unveiling, got potential but I never met it
He be trying to come over, it seem like God won’t let it
Either he never got my invite or he just dismissed it
But if all I’m hearing are the sounds of blackness, why am I pessimistic?
You’ll never progress if you’ll never try
All I ask, let every word I birth, never die
My wings spread, but when I met the sky
Weather didn’t change like I thought and had me petrified

It’s enough to make you black out, pull a Mac out
Aim it at the sky while I’m running from the black cloud
Every day we playing cat-and﻿-mouse
As I watch it hovering over my glass house
It’s enough to make you spazz out, pull a Mac out
Aim it at the sky while I’m running from a black cloud
Tired enough for me to pass out, tired of running from the black cloud",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-black-cloud-lyrics
(Intro) All Love Lost,All Love Lost,2015.0,"Just when I thought I can't dig any deeper
Said my last shit was trash and they dig when it's deeper
They ain't see what I see, I guess my vision was weaker
Or they buy me to hear me, so we can skip all the features, I'm like
Woke me up with the pinch
So it's in English now, since they ain't wanna hear French
Ain't wanna hear Wiz, ain't want me with Kirko
They ain't wanna hear me happy, now they lookin' for hurt, yo
They'll hate it before they hear it if they think it's commercial
And so they're patiently waitin' for my fortune's reversal
Check it... it's like ever since Bundles passed
Took the high road and watched everybody underpass
Truth be told, God been lookin' out so much
That I feel guilty when I ask him for more
Then I do it like the shit ain't ever happen before
This is all the while layin' on my bathroom floor
Hold up, I'm just askin' him, give me strength to grow up
By now I'm sick and tired of layin' in my own throw up
It's a given, then self pity hits me
And I start to feel like I don't deserve to be forgiven
Like when you can't think, talkin' when you don't drink
But sneakin' 'round your own kitchen cause you gotta get a swig in
I got issues, weed and vodka will settle some
Well ain't that the pot callin' the Kettle One?
I know niggas so broke that they embezzle funds
Too busy waitin' for a chance that ain't never come
But this is bigger than havin' a debt
I mean I can't stop my brain from imaginin' death
Then out the clear blue sky I cry random tears
Used to it, me and depression been a tandem for years
I suffer from self doubt, put a cramp in my fears
If there's a God, this would be the perfect span to appear
I'm not a street nigga, never claimed that sport
And some of that train of thought's insane, had to abort
So people say I changed, I believe I should
Even so the goal's always been to leave the hood
None of this should be a shock to y'all
Logic says if you're still there, that's a knock to y'all
Since you want a nigga furthest from his dreams
Love's gone, DOA once we left the murder scene
Joe

When the love goes, the trust goes
It's like you hit my heart with a snub nose
I don't give a fuck though
Where did the love go?
Guess it's all love lost
Been a hustle, a struggle
Say the truth hurts and then cuts slow
I don't give a fuck though
Where did the love go?
Guess it's all love lost

Now this might be the realest shit I ever said
Ever thought, realest I ever fought
Ignorance is bliss, you niggas were never taught
So when a challenge is sought, you niggas never retort
Me I'm too savvy, too witty
It's just too much moxy
No percs, just a few crushed oxys
But gettin' off was imminent
When my dick became numb I was impotent
Shit got real different then
Was out in Cali with a model, little waist
And double Ds, a pretty face and long hair, name's Vivian
Not the norm for me, askin' what's wrong with me
Tried everything we could, nothin' worked, couldn't get me in
We went on so many tours high
That chemistry we once had, did it all die?
Something's changed, I just can't put my finger on
And I'd be wrong to sing a song but let it linger on
Just know I'd die for my brothers
Take on the whole world, at least try for my brothers
Just wanna know that that's reciprocated
And if that ain't the case, nigga, say it
These just words from the heart
My life coach say I never finish what I start
Work, school and relationships become one
But if I took all I could, how'd I leave it undone?
I'm givin' all the love but not receivin' any
But then they mad I'm all for self and I don't bleed for many
Shit I done made a couple of you bitches
Just by tellin' folk I was a couple with you bitches
Befuddled and so now I don't want trouble with you bitches
Had I used my better judgement, I'd have muzzled all you bitches
I gave out careers, fixed your fashion
Did this shit so much you would think I got it patented
So many loved and mentioned me
Judged but can't sentence me
Real nigga never cared
Worth a couple mil' and started from an idea
Keep it candid in the booth, never panic, I'm the truth
God starin' down on me through a panoramic roof
I copped to the murder, red handed, ain't no proof
Love's dead but you never understand it 'til it's you
True colors never hide for long
When tables turn, ain't gon' matter what side you're on
And for me that's a reoccurring theme
Love's dead, I'm just walkin' y'all through a murder scene

When the love goes, the trust goes
It's like you hit my heart with a snub nose
I don't give a fuck though
Where did the love go?
Guess it's all love lost
Been a hustle, a struggle
Say the truth hurts and then cuts slow
I don't give a fuck though
Where did the love go?
Guess it's all love lost",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-intro-all-love-lost-lyrics
Downfall,Mood Muzik 4.5: The Worst Is Yet To Come,2011,"Yall don't know me
Honestly, I can't say that I blame yall
I don't even really know myself
But, yall probably shouldn't know me

Last thing I'm tryna be is the good guy now
I ain't never gave a fuck, why should I now?
Like the world's interrupting my song, with an interlude
Can't y'all see I'm busy trying to balance out my chemical?
Finishing up, what y'all ain't even begin to do
When your back's against the ropes it's either him or you
Y'all ain't so important that my words are meant for you
When did ey'body become so sensual
Caught up in the he-say, she-say, blog sites
Him and her, broke up, WorldStar, Nahright
Dumb fans, they believe, everything that y'all write
Found out, friends fake, couldn't even facade right
Pressures on, won't fail, nigga got too much to prove
Would've been, lost it, but I got too much to lose
Say what you want about Joe, but I stood my ground
Bitch, I get it up myself, you just put it down
They say, I put my whole life on display to my dismay
Stop it, you're carrying on without logic
Let me tell you this about Joe
I only say what I want you to hear
You'll only see what I want to show
Crushing up the Percocet, chasing the high, Talli
I couldn't make this shit up if I tried
The forecast shows a downpour
Y'all just made God cry, praying for my Downfall

This shit I'm talking 'bout right here
Let me tell you niggas something
You can be anything in this world that you want
Except for my downfall

I'm a victim of society, circumstance or just feelings
Was a nigga victimized? Or just willing?
No blinds, no bags, just dealing
No foundation or floor plan, just building
Check it, nights bright, but the days dark
Covered in tattoos, but hate art
These eggshells I walk on are razor sharp
Staring at the finish line, looking for a way to start
I've been called everything, an extremist
Is that a bad thing or what they really mean is
Anything a nigga do, a nigga mean it
And I won't let a person, place or thing come between it
An opportunist is how they paint me
But if the nigga only knocks once can you blame me?
Still I feel like my problems are great
Shit, if I don't never solve em' I'm straight
On the bright side God choose me to put a lot on my plate
So he had to figure I wouldn't be bothered by the weight
I'm trying to change the pattern but it's on loop
Even an outcast in my own group
What's it mean when ey'body standing next to you expects of you
Everything that comes wit a spectacle?
If everywhere I go, I just leave behind residue
Tell me, trust me, I won't think nothing less of you

I'm sorry I ain't around more
Come up with me, or stay on the ground floor
I don't need shelter from the downpour
Y'all can be whatever you want, just not my downfall
They tryna make me slow, tryna take me, no!
Can't be my downfall
They tryna knock my grind, I won't stop, I'm fine
Can't be my downfall

No moment of clarity
The next fight showing is a rarity
Severity in me against my growin popularity
Rappers won't rap, I'm forced to believe they scared of me
But can no longer use the scape goat, 'They not aware of me'
So y'all can go and throw your little pot shots
Some dudes dissed me and temporarily got hot
I'm getting my head right, recollecting
Y'all looking for some website resurrection
Being that I got too much to lose
Or maybe a slight chance that a nigga guilty of all that I'm accused
No longer amused, affected my loved ones
Now they startin' to bruise
And I don't want no parts of that abuse
Wouldn't wish upon my worst foe, a day in my shoes
That'll just eliminate any excuse
And why entertain em'?
Old me would'a lost my senses, y'all just helping the new me regain em'
Been punched in the face
It was either feed my family or hunt wit the .38
I ain't want brunch to wait
I've out grown Hip-Hop, it turned into a Day-Care
So next time some shit is on my mind, it'll stay there
I'm staring at the man in the mirror
But it ain't helping see the man any clearer
So I get M.I.A from around y'all
Till God stops answering these prayers for my downfall


Tell me what am I to do
If I ain't have a soul a nigga always had you, pardon due
But I gotta speak candidly
How the FUCK could you abandon me?!?
Wit 5 years of blood, sweat and tears
But it was obviously a disconnect
We turned that into a disrespect
Said she been holding it inside for years, she's unhappy
So the girl I wan' marry was afraid to come and tap me
So I went away on tour, and you went on one of your own
But while you was on the horn all day wit ol' boy
Did you ever think about what it would do to your home?
What's his name? Where's he live?
What is it he offers? What's he got to give?
And I love you so much that when I caught on to your fibs
I hit you like a man, you wore it in your ribs
I was heated
But had to be strong enough to remove the infidelity and see what's underneath it
Come to find out you felt lied to and cheated
Mistreated, and kept it a big secret
Or are you just loose?
And I'm so naive I'm tryna give you an excuse
Now that I refuse to believe, we life partners
Holy water on whatever devil come and try to part us
Can't use anything I ever gave you to bury me
You supposed to be the one to bury me
You wan' leave? Then goodbye
Think the grass look greener on the other side, but it's dye",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-downfall-lyrics
No Church in the Wild (Freestyle),UnKnown,2012.0,"Ugh, ugh, ugh
Uh-oh
That NJ bullshit, I'm on it
Joey
Can I talk my shit again?
Just wanna know
Just wanna know if I can talk my shit again
Ayy, couldn't blame me
I had to
Y’all can threaten me with ya thoughts, just never speak it
One gun accompanied by prayers I never need it
Burning flesh, skin peeling, slow inferno
Take away what we love, we’d all be Joe Paterno (Talk to 'em)
Reporting live from the city where they gun tote (Tote)
Sober in the sauna full of blunt smoke (Talk to 'em)
Y’all concerned with Drake and Common
(Me?) I’m concerned with niggas havin’ fake in common
Though I’m leading I don’t really know the path
But the future can’t be worse if you really know my past
Begged to be understood anytime I showed the wrath
But how could I expect third parties to know the half? (Ayy)
Like, when the temp rises, but you the candle wick
Sorta like Kyle Williams out in Candlestick
E'rybody shouldn’t grab the hammer by the grip, shit!
Billy Cundiff couldn’t handle the kick, shit
They say I changed since stardom
Can’t share the same success, we ain’t share the same problems
So, got big just to show ‘em what the gym does
Never mind shootin’: they ain’t show me where the gym was (Ayy)
That’s why I do a lot on spite
So if you look up to me, you got ‘em at the wrong height
I mean, I’m not a role model (Nah), I’m a piece of shit (Nah)
A product of never being given a piece of shit
Breaking day got the grind of a trucker
And my logic ain’t designed to intertwine with you suckers
Loaded nine is a buffer, but no time for you fuckers
There’ll be bodies in the sewers when my mind's in the gutter (Owww!)
Last night I had an epiphany
Then wrote it in my rhyme book in calligraphy (Ayy)
I see so many people looking for validity
That’s the wrong search if what’s lost is dignity
I certainly have grown since Mouse
Chrome under the couch (But I...)
But I’ll stomp his face to make it known what I’m about
If he on what he spout
Put my Nikes on his cheeks, now he foaming at the mouth (Get it?)
Ugh, reminded when I vent
Nigga, God designed it, it's in the print
Two memos for the spineless, one's repent
Second jewel: even my kindness is a strength, nigga!
No beef, no malice, not at all (Not at all)
I got no vendetta for y’all (I promise)
I mean I only want better for myself
Sometimes, I even want better for y’all, I swear
There’s no love in hip-hop
Irony, not even on 
Love and Hip-Hop
 (Nope)
Spacious closets, Persian rugs
Make sure I’m dressed at my best for the jerks that judge
Had a talk with my ex and knew for certain I was bugged
So I let the door slam feelin’ worse then I was
She said all I ever made her feel was hurt and disgust
Which in turn hurt cause that was my version of love, I cared
Clear, yeah, that you need better resolution
It seems the chances, we agree, are forever ruined (Ugh)
You talking 'bout how, I’m talkin’ about execution
You talking 'bout now, I’m talkin’ about evolution
Ugh, but better days gotta come
I’m a good amount of bad, right amount of so wrong
And Heidi Klum left Seal, which only prove my point
Shit can only be ugly for so long
Slaughterhouse founder, can't derail the captain
Ain’t enough niggas praying I fail for it to happen
'Cause on both sides of the coin you’ll get fed shells (Bow!)
In unison, hollow heads from redtails
I don’t wanna see your weapon
To keep me from what I’m destined
Some’ll see that as a blessin’ (Ugh)
And my dudes swear they’ll keep me happily from harm (So)
So I do the leg work, they carry the arms (Brrrat)
Check it, shorty I had over Saturday
Never act away, and squirt ‘til she oversaturate
She go hard in the dark, no chains
But see I’m gettin' it, even when the car is in park, nigga!
The hood is on some bullshit
So it ain't weird to see ‘em aiming at the pulpit
Fates are empty, collection plate, spirit in ruins
We used to a different type of communion
When guns take the place of the choir, tie up the pastor
If he scared, can't believe what he say ‘bout the life after (Oh)
The stained glass is bulletproof
Sometimes, a liar's mouth can be full of truth
I done heard gospel from a sinner
Told me to season my pride if that’s dinner
Said there’s no human that walks without sin
So we should probably call the gates, make sure we allowed in (Joey!)",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-no-church-in-the-wild-freestyle-lyrics

[Verse: Joe Budden & (

Look, I woke up without a heart beat
But I remember we was just in the car deep
Was at a light and got approached by a car thief
He pulled out but didn't ask for no car keys
A loud noise without a voice but I'm tryna scream out shit is not fair
I can't tell you where I'm at or how I got here
Surrounded by all white, maybe it's just cloudy
Escorted by two men who knew everything about me
Both of them so strong, kept saying hold on
Feel like my soul's gone, naked, no clothes on
I know this can't be my fate
I scream ""Wait!"", as they drop me in front of a gate
They left no trace, I can see my every breath
Like a cold day, 
stood before a man with no face
He said to me, (
""Please don't make this any harder""
)
""Who the fuck is you?"" (
""My child I'm your father""
)
""I only got one dad!""
 (
""Is that a fact to you?
He left you when you was young I brought him back to you
You're real close to heaven, few get to step in
Now tell me what you've done to deserve to be let in?""
)
""Look I'm far from a Christian, not big on religion
But ain't done too much wrong my entire time living
Never killed, never tried too, though I been lied to
Was once suicidal, never read the Bible
I always been a care taker tried to nurse people
At times it back fired, hurt people, hurt people
Plus I never use your name in vain
But you should know everything I'm being asked to explain""
(
""I know you stole from your mothers purse""
) ""You can't count that
That was way back when!"" (
""It's still a sin""
) ""But I was ten!""
(
""You robbed people, stole""
) ""Yeah and you made me see jail!""
(
""But I also seen you lay your hands on a female
Sold drugs to parents none of that was needed
Abandoned your child, on every girl you cheated
Done wrong to people that only want the best for you
Any time you thought you were alone I was next to you
""
)
""When it came to baby moms God you gave me the worse one!""
(
""But that was your second child Joe, you shouldn't have killed the first one""
)
""I ain't have a job, ain't have a pot to piss in""
(
""Look I gave you a gift and you made the wrong decision
Held onto resentments even in doing business
I lead by example, I teach forgiveness
Your entry can not be guar-an-teed
Not when you live with anger, envy, greed
Pride, sloth, lust even gluttony
Everything you shouldn't if you woulda joined my covenant"")
""Look I'm only human, I ain't perfect""
(
""That I understand, when I take you out a jam
You don't even think to worship
And when you do, you never talk about what you can do for me
It's what I can do for you
I blessed you with health, family and wealth
With all the blessings you received you still always want help""
)
""Yeah, there's been times in my life, I needed help to make money
But why everything I love you manage to take from me?
Yet you stand there an question a nigga that tries hard
And finds a way when you keep
 dealing them fucked up cards
You make mistakes like me far as I can see
I think its a mockery whenever rich niggas win the lottery
Gave us Bush twice, God, I hate to be rude
But you let skinny niggas starve, give obese niggas food
The nerve of you telling me I don't deserve to stay here
When you gave us drugs and guns, you put AIDS here!
Take a look at you, your actions are cold hearted
The harsh shit is you bring babies in the world retarded
I know most my actions put me in a cell
But how you mad at me when you put me into hell""
(
""See my child, you need gratitude, maybe just a sample
I never give a person anything they can't handle
Don't tell me about everything you had to go through
There's reasons for my actions even if I never showed you
Kept trying with you, all you did was hurt me
Still gave you chances to prove that you was worthy
And so I sat with you on a train
I asked you for change, you kept calling me names
Prolly didn't notice I was the store clerk
You put the gun to me, get money for more work
My child, I know you have it in you to indeed stop
This is not your final calling just a brief stop
Hope you heed my words and understand
So when I send you back you should be a better man
Look at life different the next time we see each other
There'll be no need for talk whenever we meet each other""

Unnecessary Pain,All Love Lost,2015.0,"I still picture your affection
I still hear you like we're talkin' on the phone
I Still feel it
Like you're right there holdin' on to me
But words cannot explain
We will never be us again
Everything has changed
Or is that just you givin' up again?
More unnecessary pain

I would ask how we ended up here, but I drove
And you allowed me
Or maybe it's only me that remembers it
Cause you're so easily told about me
But not once while we were on that road did you doubt me
Played your position, writin' out our books
I noticed a page missin', blame it on the age difference
I see you in the club, now days you're resistant
You used to get excited just to never pay admission
Lookin' for the old you, wishin' shit was normal
Tried to mold you and you ended up with it on you
Live around the corner, yeah we ain't even formal
So I'm askin' God, why you alive and I gotta mourn you
Word, I see you got a little crew now
A bunch of ugly broke bitches I know better than
And I ain't tryna say them hoes usin' you
Well actually who would I be kiddin'? Yes I am
I see your life from far and something's off with it
It's my fault and shit, I shoulda never altered it
I sold a dream when you couldn't have known the cost of it
Knew my love came with a pain and I still offered it
Seein' your weight loss, knowin' I'm the cause of it
If that ain't my signature, then shit, somebody forgin' it
But you think I ain't hurt, like it ain't no guilt in me
Like it ain't killin' me, I'm out here on a killin' spree
A sickness, I ain't found a way to nurse it yet
Like I ain't a nervous wreck, like it's no reverse effect
Internal bleedin' and the cuts run deep
Every time I leave one love, a loved one leaves
I wish I could take the pain away, but only yours
I'll be fine if I remain this way
See I deserve whatever punishment I get
You could sentence me to years
Of hearin' my vic's voice even when nothin' is there

I still picture your affection
I still hear you like we're talkin' on the phone
Still feel it
Like you're right there holdin' on to me
But words cannot explain
We will never be us again
Everything has changed
Or is that just you givin' up again?
More unnecessary pain

I done gone so long not givin' a fuck
That it's no longer erratic, now it's a normal habit
Even when I go my way, I gotta have it
Bury me with my sweats on and bitches in the casket
All the waiters and words, I let 'em loom on
Every verse real enough to write it on my tombstone
And so you know how real that paranoia be
Even make me think my demise is avoidin' me
The sick part is I withstand that abuse
Long as the fans are amused, am I a man or a muse?
Never sugarcoat it when I hand it to the youth
Fell from all over the world, and always landed in the booth
I hold music in such a high regard that
To this day I still feel like it's destiny
And to these fans that I once gave my life for
I gotta tell you that it's not much left in me
Yeah, and not that it's growin' old
But years of bearin' my soul is takin' it's toll
Took a father from his son, but is it best that way?
I'm so fucked up inside I can't regret that Trey
Hold my head up high at the gates after my time's up
They say you saved somebody's life by givin' mine up
Wouldn't be the first time that I went without
Chased my true love so much that I resent it now
You can put this in the scriptures like it's sacred
To live with it, but hate it is to giveth then to take it
Goin' through the motions, it'll strip a nigga naked
I guess it's for a cause if all the kids are gonna play it
Trust me, I ain't been the same yet
You'll stop and stare any time you see a trainwreck
And I'll take whatever punishment they give
You can sentence me to years
Of hearin' that fan's voice even when nothin' is there

I still picture your affection
I still hear you like we're talkin' on the phone
Still feel it
Like you're right there holdin' on to me
But words cannot explain
We will never be us again
Everything has changed
Or is that just you givin' up again?
More unnecessary pain

Still learnin' to live with
People coming in and out my life
The ones who matter show it over time
That's why they always stay on my mind
So I live in reality
Nobody else matters to me but you, you, you
Why try to hide the truth?

I still picture your affection
I still hear you like we're talkin' on the phone
Still feel it
Like you're right there holdin' on to me

Where Do We Go,All Love Lost,2015.0,"Good evening
How's everybody feeling out there
Y'all good?
I talk my shit again?

I really don't know where we should go from here
It feels like time is escaping
I don't want to waste it nooooo
But in the back of my mind
It feels like, like we should just let it go
Where do we go?

You ain't gotta adore me or keep it friendly
And even if you ain't for me, don't be against me
Your people tell you ignore me and say it simply
But you get lonely and call me, that always tempts me
We get caught in the moment and then we fall back
Then I get horny and you take that as a crawl back
Now there's an irony hidden if you can call it that
I walk all over you, yet you be on my doormat
And unbeknownst to you, that whole plan of attack
She sayin' only with me does her sanity lack
Her truth come out when she drunk, but I amnesty that
I talk logic and she screamin' profanity back
Now when I think long term, you can't hand me that
But for now she need a crutch
There I am to take advantage of the handicap
Just me givin' you truth, I don't demand it back
Guess I'm just a fan of facts, hope you understandin' that

I really don't know where we should go from here
It feels like time is escaping
I don't want to waste it nooooo
But in the back of my mind
It feels like, like we should just let it go
Where do we go?

Check it, I'm like royalty around y'all
Down to fall with niggas I feel as loyal as me
Which is prolly why loyalty is my downfall
Got few friends that be coyin' me to count more
But steel sharpens steel, let me sound off
Still gotta question your will and what you're down for
It's real, I question your wheels, wish they was round more
The ilk of your found cloth are you built for the downpour
All I try to do is lead by example
Seems some are content with niggas feedin' them a sample
Tried to create a path, know the streets can be a handful
Me I made it out without degrees on the mantle
Though my money good, I'm overseas gettin' ample
It'll never mean the snakes and all the leeches I can handle
The bond is broke now, I believe it's gettin' trampled
Gotta pick up your pants, wear your creases like a man do

I really don't know where we should go from here
It feels like time is escaping
I don't want to waste it nooooo
But in the back of my mind
It feels like, like we should just let it go
Where do we go?

It's been weeks now, maybe we both feel so weak now
Time's past, should be cool for us to speak now
And you got so much pride, was no surprise
I had to reach out, shit, you used to creep through my house
Outside of bein' fine, I always said you was cool
You would leave in time to get your son ready for school
And I'll admit, that was admirable
Suckin' me off every night without you ever losin' sight of what you had to do
Fucked for seven months straight, shit was magical
You broke it off over shit that wasn't factual
How could I fuck with you?
With you actin' so gullible and all, I'm reluctant to move forward
You fell in love with me quick, was down to wait for me
But that held us down, was like a weight for me
You wanted answers
Said we can't keep fuckin' without a title, you won't sit back idle
And to me it was intangibles
Reasons I couldn't be the man for you
Part of why a nigga ran from you
Part of why I was passive and dismissive
Why we had that awkward goodbye and I ain't fix it
Why I let your Bimmer pull off and I ain't miss it
I lied cause the truth was really none of your business
I felt like the hostings, was a hoe thing
Late nights, strip clubs, really the whole thing
But that's my own baggage in fact
Plus you slept with other rappers at that
Just some shit that tamed my own brain, this is after the fact
It's my bad, not yours, I know the past is the past
I'm hopin' all's forgiven, you not stuck in that time
Maybe we can fuck one last time, I'm playin' with you
Here's to bein' grown and communicatin' issues
We was never together but a nigga stayin' with you

I really don't know where we should go from here
It feels like time is escaping
I don't want to waste it nooooo
But in the back of my mind
It feels like we should just let it go
Where do we go

Where do we go from here?
What are we doin'?
Where do we come from?
Where do we go from here?
Can I talk my shit again?
Joey
Where do we go from here?
Parks let me get one more

I remember it like it just happened
Scratch that, can't dismember it, it just happened
Funny how one death'll let these mishaps in
That's exactly what's about to occur
I defer, here's the stinger
I'm right where I grew up and lost my finger
How we let it all linger?
Whole family in black where you used to reside
All here to say our final goodbyes
Them to you, me to them
My thought with every tear that I cried
Whole mornin' I was mournin' family that had survived
Now that you are gone, you took with you all of the magic that you performed
And so our issues of a much deeper root is born
The weight fell, don't know who it's on
And since our glue is gone, this is how we movin' on
Truth in song, all quiet like the mute is on
Speak to me from Heaven above if I'm doin' this wrong

Say somethin'
Just let a nigga know you hear me
Where do we go from here?
Rest in peace
What up?
Where do we go
Where do we go from here?
Understand me?
Do anybody hear me?
Joey
I love you
Where do we go from here?",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-where-do-we-go-lyrics
Love For You,All Love Lost,2015.0,"Just gotta get these thoughts off real quick
See I'm a thinker, it's like thinking shit
It's when you got..
You sittin' there reflectin', thinkin' shit
I peep it though

Look, you liked me better before you knew my history
Before you knew who I was
That's when reachin' our potential felt likely
Nobody like me
Besides see if I stop bein' who I am
I'm straight to it, who I might be
But you gotta look inside each song
That's where I proved it was really in sight all along
Bear it all so the privacy gone
Grab the pen, sit down and write these wrongs
Just how I right these wrongs, but look
You liked me better when I spoke usin' censorship
Before you knew I was really insensitive
That was back when it was you and me
Then curiosity killed you, you had to Google me
Now I won't call the headlines a liar
Some are true and some are false, that's for y'all to decipher
But look, on rare occasions some of what they say'll bother me
I liked it better when the 'Net was still a novelty
'Cause now people who ain't found themselves
Get an outlet, yet don't know how they sound themselves
They like me better when I'm silent and don't have an opinion
Pretendin' to blend in like I'm a minion
Say if Joe keep talkin' that shit, he'll get him shot
But if rappers can't tie my shoes, how can I not?
Thought I had my city's support, I couldn't believe
Jersey City liked me better when I couldn't leave
I take it back, that ain't set in stone
They more so had weapons drawn 'cause I left alone
I liked it better when I had nothin' to lose
The days when I felt like I had somethin' to prove
Shit, even for me that's unusual
If you don't give a fuck then who you gotta prove it to?
Just the world that I was born in
You gotta learn to form wins against the storm wind
They like me better when I fuck and never call again
Without it, they don't know what type of box I belong up in
They like me better without reality television
Guess they didn't need to witness the hell I was livin'
In my shoes, you too would seal a fate
Poppin' 20 pills a day, somebody gon' feel a way
Look, uh, and so these hoes just to pass time
After the past time, they don't even pass my mind
You liked me better way before you got lied to
But that don't really matter when you want me inside you
Your friends sayin' leave, they don't know that you tried to
You can't speak to them, I'm the nigga you cry to
I liked it better when nobody ever heard of me
'Fore pop had to get that knee surgery
Guess that affected his bladder
So when Jackie called me nothin' else really mattered
Was scared, sounded frantic, I ain't want no parts of that
Said the ambulance came, might be a heart attack
Was leavin' work nearly cryin' on the phone
I'm in rush hour traffic, just seen you dyin' alone
Look, I just pictured all the places that we never went
All the texts that were never sent
All the words we never spoke
Time we never shared, rewind so we can repair
Such an inspiration, all the holes that you dug through
Then you got released, God was watchin' above you
I'm thinkin' you healin', I don't wanna disrupt you
So I'm right back to never tellin' you that I love you
And I don't wanna act that way
If I take somethin' for granted, I don't wanna give it back that way
Forreal, that's how shit get lost, let me chill
I like it better when I'm not talkin' over my thoughts, now listen

I've done been down, been down, it's all for you
How you feelin' out there?
And I don't wanna get in your way
How everybody doin', alright?
Get you somethin' to drink
And I don't wanna get in your way
Get you somethin' to smoke, get you somethin' to light up
Whatever your vice is, we here though
Said this love is all for you
That shit don't be for everybody, man
Said this love is all for you

Now the singers wanna rap, the rappers wanna sing
Personally I liked it better back when rappin' was a thing
'Cause now if you wanna get the high notes
When that hook come, you gotta hit the high notes
The label wanna sell singles
I'm sellin' a story and that'll just taint the message
Bad marriage, we ain't got the same objective
Still I'm here cause real niggas in the game respect it
Look, they like it better when I let 'em live rent free
I never knew that once it stopped we'd be enemies
And though I come off as heartless, nigga
In spite of yourself, got love for you regardless, nigga
Now listen, I liked you better when you wasn't in the spotlight
Was too addicted to it, said some shit was not right
So when you work so much I couldn't complain
'Til I learnt she was gateway escapin' from the pain
The strippers talk to me like I'm their therapist
That scares the good girls away, don't know the hell I get
Whatever thoughts you contrive, I can't help you with
But you've been tossin' it for a year and I derail the shit
I'm self made, I don't do what I'm told
The type that needs free reign, to be out of control
Forreal, 'cause when that's gone I'm lost, let me chill
I like it better when I'm not talkin' over my thoughts, word

I've done been down, been down, it's all for you
Y'all don't understand me
I don't think they get it though
And I don't wanna get in your way
Don't know why you don't apply like, our experiences and shit
And I don't wanna get in your way
To like, my experiences with other people
Said this love is all for you, this love is all for you, ooh
Said this love is all for you",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-love-for-you-lyrics
Immortal,All Love Lost,2015.0,"What if the hunger was missin'? What if the passion was gone?
If we're truthfully speakin', never saw it lastin' this long
If the words didn't rhyme, what would I do for a livin'?
But I've been dead for so long, I figure I'm due for some livin'
They only see the effects, never pay no mind to the cause
My thinking is so complex, simplicity can get lost
What if everybody was real and I wasn't surrounded by frauds?
The moral in that is so priceless just cause I know what it costs
Lookin' back, damn near every problem, I had it
Never got 'em retracted
I combat it, problematic, every problem of an addict
But that's just the way the cards fell
Heartfelt but can you be cheated if God dealt?
Fuck this shit, only regret that I have is ever bein' regretful
I mean they all tried to kill me, none of them were successful
A few I knew for some years, some never met me and tried
But you can't kill nothin' that's ready to die

They say I live my own way, own way, and that's fine
I'm just livin' my own way, own way, like I can't die
They can't remove my heart, my soul might take it's toll
The air I breathe and the ground below
But no way, no way, let 'em all try
That's how it feels to be immortal
Immortal
That's how it feels to be immortal
Immortal
That's how it feels to be immortal

And now I'm feelin' like Steven when he was up in that hospital
Nigga shot him nine times, they got him thinkin' illogical
Crippled, feelin' immortal, he cheated death, he unstoppable
He just want that revenge, nigga, feel like dying's impossible
They want me to regress like I ain't been through the worst
Instead of me bein' blessed, they want me pinned in that dirt
If you knew me in the past you would think my winning's deserved
They never noticed my path and all the sins I did first
Both my parents did drugs, see they put them syringes to work
And I carry that same exact gene, but I never mention I'm cursed
Those prescriptions were murder, I blame it all on that nurse
She started my relapse way back, I developed a thing for them percs
Fuck this shit, only regret that I have is ever bein' regretful
Them fuckin' pills tried to kill me, none of them were successful
I close my hands on my knees, send these words to the sky
You can't kill nothin' that's ready to die, fuck this shit

Say I live my own way, own way, and that's fine
I'm just livin' my own way, own way, like I can't die
They can't remove my heart, my soul might take it's toll
The air I breathe and the ground below
But no way, no way, let 'em all try
That's how it feels to be immortal
Immortal
That's how it feels to be immortal
Immortal
That's how it feels to be immortal

See I'm so self destructive, hurt anyone that come near
Done it my whole career, was always one of her fears
Hurt her so much in the past, I'm supposed to be healin' her
But she love me so much, she say that it's only killin' her
Now she say she can't watch it, pill poppin', it's toxic
Promised her I would stop it, just go hide when I pop it
It's a shame we can never be the same, wasn't prideful
How can I tell you I'm nowhere near finished from bein' suicidal?
Baby that wasn't me, just some nigga that smelled like me
Fuck like you stuck by some nigga that felt like me
You watched me lose weight, you just waited there helplessly
You just offerin' help to me, I just dissed at you selfishly
When you left, I condemned you, really I should commend you
Not for havin' that in you, but for havin' the strength to
I make amends to you now, you shouldn't have seen me that high
I killed you when you wasn't ready to die

Say I live my own way, own way, and that's fine
I'm just livin' my own way, own way, like I can't die
They can't remove my heart, my soul might take it's toll
The air I breathe and the ground below
But no way, no way, let 'em all try
That's how it feels to be immortal

That's how it feels to be immortal

Who Killed Hip Hop?,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Can anybody pinpoint the day it went wrong?
I mean, I used to blame Reggaeton, I can’t front
I thought all that was corny, was it Ja’s fault?
Lil Mo said she ain’t get paid for ""Put It On Me""
Look, you bring it up and dudes get on some coy shit
Was it T-Pain with that funny voice shit?
Or was it Lil Wayne with that funny voice shit?
The whole game dick rode that funny voice shit
I can’t tell when it happened
Was it when Lil Jon showed dudes you could sell without rapping?
Was it Laffy Taffy? I thought they was kiddin’
Shawty Lo said ‘Dey Know!’, I really didn’t
Dancin’ became cool again, then came ""Walk It Out""
But I ain’t know what the fuck niggas was talkin’ bout
Unit kicked Game out, they ain’t give a fuck
Then we see the same shit happen to Buck
It was a few years ago, but I remember the summer
50 made fans start looking at the numbers
A&R’s won’t take risks, they won’t sign niggas
The word ‘swag’ came out and started to blind niggas
Rap dudes want reality shows
And my dumbass was thinking that reality sold
Did it start with the iPod?
Or when rappers had to pay DJ’s for them to do their job?
Now all the content is the same, it don’t differ
Everybody sold some drugs or pulled triggers
The more you think about, you gonna just get sicker
I mean, why the fuck would Nas wanna call his shit ‘Nigga’? NIGGA!
Was it when the Wu broke up?
Pac, B.I.G., Pun went to sleep, never woke up
Lupe was doing a tribute and choked up
Some of these stupid ass fans was like, “So what?”
Some them they ain’t educated
Fuck blaming the south, we ain’t segregated
I mean, it was all good around the Kiss and Beans shit
Took a left turn around the Kiss and Green shit
Maybe it all started when Roc-A-Fella parted
Ways, it’s natural to shift toward fame
I watched every last one of dudes shit on Dame
Kind of got that in common, I can dig that pain
When they gave Jay a desk and suit
They finally gave a rapper a chance to come execute
But somethin’ told me the suits at the tables was hurtin’
They Fired everybody, labels started merging
Far as sales? The decline is strong
As the experts, they’ll say that the climate’s wrong
I mean, some niggas prime is gone
I peeped it when niggas started puttin’ fake diamonds on
You can tell a dude, “I spit better than you”
But then he’ll say, “I’m richer for whatever I do”
I seen all this coming, I knew what we was in for
Back when Erick Sermon had jumped out of the window
Was it when Ma$e retired? He couldn't hack it
Tip could, he just needed some more ratchets
DJ’s, Producers, the one’s who get us the farthest
Said, “Fuck rappers!”, and they became the artists
I gotta talk candid
Did we start having issues around the same time Jimmy and Cam did?
Or was it when Chingy thought he ain't need Ludacris?
His Next album, found out that that was ludicrous
Papoose and Clipse both survived
Inking with Jive, then getting jived
Your man Jae Hood repped that D-Block gang
Then I seen dude dragging his D-Block chain
Or did one-hit wonders change it all along?
They made labels only want to sign a dude’s song
And you really don’t know shit
If you think the fans pick the videos on 106
I’m just stating the truth
Did it start when Fox stayed in the news
More than she did the booth?
Or was it when Lil Kim stopped exploiting sex?
The fuck is up with DMX?
I hope dude’s straight
Have an opinion and they gonna say you hate
I can’t front, I’m missing the old Clue tapes
Next thing, the underground sunk further
The feds was on Irv so The Inc dropped Murder
I never blame Fab, Jeezy, Rick Ross
Did shit get lost when Shyne went up north?
I’ll never understand the hiphop police
When hiphop is what hiphop needs to police
These blatant-ass radio attempts sound so bland
Twista kept trying to recreate ‘Slow Jamz’
Then we send the wrong message with our slang
Broke niggas blowing they rent to make it rain
So you walk in and give a bitch a few $20′s
She’ll smerk her face up, looking at you funny
This chick told me she only take new money
Man, I snatched my shit back sooo fast
Or did it start when rappers said, ‘Fuck it’
Sacrificed music and started raping they budget
Nothing wrong with dude’s being candy or pop
Something was wrong when Joc did the Candy Shop
We buying our own records, maybe no one’s to blame
Are we a business that we can’t afford to maintain?
Second week show that boy numbers ain’t high
I hate to break it to you, numbers always lie
Or when Ortiz signed to Aftermath
And Now he’s feeling the aftermath
Was it Fight Klub fucking with them battle raps?
Not too many of them gettin’ signed after that
I mean, some can’t stay afloat
A million Busta albums he’s still not mentioned with the GOATs
Fuck looking for answers, time will tell
Was it when Def Jam didn’t want to resign L?
A 15-year old told me Cass was ass
Rather than spazz, all dude could do was laugh
Or was it when the whole East Coast fell off?
Or got comfortable, maybe dude’s was too well off
The more niggas said they didn’t write down lyrics
The more it started to sound like they didn’t
But, do whatever you can to keep the lights on
But Dumbin’ down just became the new “DYLAN!”
Honestly, I ain’t know what to think
A few years ago we had the young kids wearing pink
I can’t blame the fans for not knowing a damn thing
When We trained them to be this way
I mean showed ‘em whatever to sell with no limits
Since the early 90′s, sold ‘em a false image
So when some shit comes that don’t fit the mold
It’s like mole and nigga you won’t even do Gold
They watch the videos
See you on the corner with a whole bunch of people and think that you hood
They turn on the TV
See these video bitches and they think niggas girls really look that good
I mean They get so many free verses when the album drops, the shit’s more like a bonus
Why pay for it? Why take onus?
With one click of the mouse they could own it
I mean some of them are fooled so easily
By whatever we say or we show ‘em on TV
But that was all part of the plan
Or was it when Eminem made ‘Stan’?
I swear some of these fans, they put they whole life on the line
It’s like they can’t like more than one rapper at a time
Less about the product, more about the digits
It’s a business, we got less fans and more critics
Maybe we at a cross
Canibus made one of the dopest diss records but some still say he lost
And I ain’t believe my ears when niggas tried to tell me
That KRS-One had a rap beef with Nelly
If rap was alive, we’d be trying to be the best rappers ever
Not the best rapper alive
But you won’t get accepted at all if you ain’t street tough
Onyx was the hardest ’til Sticky got beat up
Now ‘I’m A Thug’ is how I gotta behave
If I wanna be paid, if I wanna see praise
You know something’s wrong when niggas are getting shot
And you gotta sit and wonder if the whole thing’s staged
It ain’t REAL no more
Or did we just expand on our audience, maybe we appeal to more
Or, do we think ya’ll are just getting dumber?
We tried to make gettin’ older getting younger
Did we lose our hunger? Something’s gotta give
Did we outgrow ourselves? Is hiphop for kids?
If it is, they turn on MTV Cribs
And think, “That’s where these motherfuckers really live!”
Or, was it when Lauryn Hill dropped a classic?
So did the Fugees, til Wyclef tapped it
Songs don’t do it no more, the shit’s shocking
Seen it when “Lean Back” had the whole world rocking
Now it’s “Fuck your bars!” if your hook is fly
So we look at Crooked I with a crooked eye
Dope ass rappers ain’t seeing no dough
If everything’s commercial, where the fuck is the show?
But anybody making a dime, see ima wish well
Still we took a big L losing Big L
Or was it when YouTube came in the game?
Now nobody’s from their living room can make a name
Or when Indies like Koch came and blew up
Niggas at the majors they literally threw up
To some, it ain’t fun no more
You know it’s fucked up when DMC don’t talk to Run no more
To many egos, like we ain’t one no more
Shit’s predictable, niggas ain't stunned no more
We startin’ to see shit we never seen before
At one point, we even had the magazines at war
OR, was it street DVD’s like Smack?
Showed you just how stupid your favorite rapper would act
This shit get lifeless
When MTV made a list of the hottest and ignored the nicest
Changed the whole steelo
I mean the averaged fan never heard of Goodie Mob or a Cee Lo
But they heard of Gnarls Barkley!
And Dr. Carter still say we got a heartbeat
I ain’t gonna lie, I was scared to death, straight up
I started to hear rumors of an Outkast breakup
I was like, “That ain’t true, it sounds desperate”
Then started to see Big Boi and 3K separate
We had periods where it was drier than a desert
Are we all killin’ this shit? Is it a group effort?
Are we alive and well or barely surviving?
Is it R&B’s fault? Them niggas is thriving
Then a lot of people go and blame LimeWire
I don’t think it’s downloadin’ dog, the line’s tired
Did the fans just get tired of the outcome?
One dope single and a bullshit album
So they share albums with each other
Was it Master P with them ugly ass album covers?
Or when we started appearing in the news?
Timberland said they didn’t want black niggas wearing they boots
I mean, I know it got foggy, at least blurry
When the label dude got knocked out by Keith Murray
Or was it when we became obsessed with the brand names?
Had the kids trying to buy shit they can’t name
And some think the evidence is ample
Did it start when Puff took advantage of the sample?
Is it all watered down with no fire?
If you had enough money you can buy a ghostwriter
Or the Diamond District, with Jacob the Jeweler
Had to buy his watch to be looked at as cooler
Fucking with them trends
Our stupid asses wasted a hundred grand on shit that ain’t even in
Look, is the game now as bad as it’s ever been?
It’s not ringtones, just the songs that they represent
I heard all of ‘em
The sad part I wouldn't recognize most these niggas if I saw ‘em
I can’t explain it, I don’t know what to tell ya
Now goin’ Gold is look at as a failure
Maybe old heads in charge just weren't able
DJ’s is spinning now with no turntable
Maybe the fans are just bored of us
Or maybe there ain't enough room for all of us
It’s like, even a friendship will stop at a point
Mike Jones went platinum off of Slim Thug’s joint
But there’s so many ways to get fuckin’ rich
Supahead caked off by just suckin’ dick
Did we sell out just to get in demand more?
Did we go against everything we used to stand for?
Both are likely
There’s two sides to a coin, who you rollin’ with: Souljah Boy or Ice-T?
Some niggas wanna sit around and complain about
I rather analyze, seek how it came about
If we could rewind the world
We wouldn’t have to watch Flava Flav try to find his girl
Look, today it’s all about marketing and promo
I remember VH1 was just for old folks
But no ma’am
If I ain’t know better, I would think that mix show is now programmed
We let the power of the dollar annihilate us
Now the size of our chain gonna validate us
It’s too simple, they can’t think we’re really deep
I just heard Chris Brown on the A Millie beat
Seen a video, it’s called Lookin’ Ass Niggas
Grabbed the remote, tired of lookin’ at niggas
But that let a nigga know if we ain’t dead
Then we just half alive, maybe brain dead
Did it start when Capone left Nore?
Nah, he went to jail, that’s a whole different story
Or, maybe somethings really wrong with our ears
Obie Trice got dropped, so much for Cheers
Female emcees, they don’t ever hit the target
Somebody said they saw Amil working in a Target
The sad part is we already lost Remy
Or did we go wrong when E-v-e got skinny?
What’s up with Jacki-O, Rah Digga, that I can’t figure
And Trina ain’t been the same since Nan Nigga
I know it had to do something to his heart beat
When Lady of Rage started doing Steve Harvey
I know we caught a lil’ trama
Somewhere between Yo Yo, Boss, and Lil Mama
Lot of females found another way to extort
Most of our video models have turned escort
Do anything to see dough
So they’ll exchange sex with an artist or director for a lead role
Or should we get back to basics?
Where’s the Rakim’s or the Master Ace’s?
The Big Daddy Kane’s, or did we never recover
From Dre not being on the side of Ed Lover
Or when rap dude started signin’ their friends?
Instead of going out and tryin’ to find niggas with skill
Seen it happen when D-12 put out Purple Pills
And while the whole hood laughed, them niggas sold a Mil’
Some of us ain’t prepared for something so lucrative
I just heard Yung Berg say some stupid shit
Like we almost caught one in the torso
When each Bone Thugs member took they own crossroads
Some disagree, some gotta see the same
Or maybe Hip Hop died on Aailyah’s plane
If it relocated where did it move to?
I still Love H.E.R. the way Common used to
Or did Bill O’ Reily come fuck up the spirit?
With negative remarks about everybody’s lyrics
Spend all this time dissin us
Nigga you 95 years old motherfucker shouldn’t be a listener
Lost Jam Master, who was tougher then leather
Or did it start when Treach started fuckin Pepa?
As our jeans got tighter and our tee’s got longer
I’m trying to figure which age group we belong to
Or did we all go astray, the second Dr. Dre left N.W.A.?
I mean in my opinion we was on easy street
When he was beefin’ with Eazy-E
Or did we get fucked up when producers found a way to cheat?
Signin unknown niggas to start making their beats
If you sell your own shit it gotta go for cheap
Put my name on it and the price increase
Or, is it cause everybody’s so self-centered?
Is that the reason Hip Hop itself ain’t centered?
Or have we already seen this shit with our own eyes?
Rico Suave, Hammer, and Vanilla Ice
Everybody want in the game so in return
You got label executives fuckin’ their interns
And anybody lookin’ at that new Vibe bracket
Should see that they don’t know a thing about this rap shit
Or maybe we shoulda stopped being proud
When there was no more Rawkus and no more Loud
Tried to get conscious around Vote or Die
So they made it look like all our votes was lies
As the years go on it’s like we keep gettin more voids
We got lost when we lost one of the Lost Boys
I knew we was impersonating a fraud
When Kay-Slay smacked my man at the awards
Regardless, it’s our fault as artists
Runnin’ with entourages who act like they ain’t never left the projects
Who do we wanna target
Will they put an Uncle Murda cd in a Wal-Mart or a Target
We got the nerve to not wanna hear Ras Kass
But fuck with V.I.C. “Get Silly” and that trash
I felt ashamed
When J-Kwon told me he ain’t like Raekwon cause he stole his name
Was back when everybody in the club got tipsy
Now every contract gotta be 360
So fuck eatin’ better scrape the plate
Now every beat gotta at least have an 808
Did the lights get dim when we first heard Mims?
And said “Another New York rapper on the South tip”
Is it overcrowded?
They keep sayin “If it’s so fucked up, then do something about it”
I doubt it, there’s just one thing they don’t understand
That job is way bigger then just one man
Or maybe all of these pleas that it’s deceased
Is false and it’s right where it needs to be?
Maybe we built on something that’ll last forever
See ‘Face and Geto Boys just got back together
Maybe no one can stop us, even other genre’s now jock us
We even doing songs with the rockers
How is that the feelin’?
Kanye’s amazin’, Wayne just sold a Million
We closer to a ceilin’
How are we in a coma?
When we the only business you can excel without a diploma
Technology changed, made everything simple
Myspace is now a dude’s bio slash demo
Aside from this rap we generatin’ more money
We took it global and penetrated other countries
So let’s celebrate, sip some Cris’
Some more shit we embrace just to end up dissed
Go and buy the bar out so we can all get bent
Let’s go and cop a bunch of cars just to still pay rent
Or here’s another bright idea to entertain
Let’s go and put our face on the bottom of a chain
Are some of us just nigga rich, with nigga money
While Jews keep laughin, “Look at these nigga dummies”
Should Hip Hop be a steppin’ stool
Till we find another role we can step into?
Some of us doin’ movies as a matter of fact
And some never stopped to plan life after rap
I mean, as a whole did we stop movin’ further
Around the time Snoop Dogg went on trial for murder?
Or was it Scarface creatin’ these clonies?
30 years later everybody’s still Tony
Maybe anybody complaining is deranged
Can you expect something to grow and not change?
We’re socially accepted, deviated our old route
To simplify the term we all sold out
I think I figured out who’s to blame
Started out Obama, ended up McCain
So we Kurt Cobain’d ourself and we’re defeated
So next time they ask “who killed it” tell em WE DID!!!",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-who-killed-hip-hop-lyrics
Just Because,UnKnown,2016.0,"You wonder why I stop and stare
I gotta admit it man
Every time you are near
I have a confession to make
Just because
I love you man
Just because
Sometimes love hurts
Just because
It's gonna hurt me more than it's gonna hurt you though
I love you

Look, listen, fuck is up with us? How we ain't agreeing?
Sensitive thugs need hugs, just the game we in
But if we ain't a team, I know what anger bring
Angled in any language you want it, mons ain't a ting
Is this a cry for help, show us the pain you in
What's in your cranium, fuck it let's put the flame to aim
Then they'll ask why I made him his most famous meme
I just tell 'em love makes you do the strangest things
They play at stadiums, I play at Stadium
Shame, shame in 'em, really what's there to gain for 'em
I see it weird though, fuck it we here though
Order my Bane mask all glass to let the beard show
Ain’t been dark in a while, pardon my style
I mean, I think I hear my part in your style
I can attach different acts to different parts of your style
Yeah we let you act as if you had parts in your style, nah
That's retarded, it couldn't be any farther out
But really ain't shit about it that's hard to doubt
Ain't bothered 'bout it, you fathered your father's style
Which makes you a grandfather, a clock I highly doubt
You a hybrid, credited with the art of it now
Evolved with a style and re-dressed it in garments from now
So listen, that ain't my argument now
Just looking back through the years, begging me not to involve it ‘til now
So this a pep talk, shouldn't be no awkwardness now
Sweet as the birds and bees from a father to a child
Look, I know sometimes you gotta father your child
Like hit the yard for a while
But be back before it’s dark or pow-pow
Rage ritual with startling growl
Manufacturer of Coke, here go bars with a smile
The shots coming though, crew been at this bar for a while
The gun tucked, the snipe's out, you see us, cardigan down
Advance for the singing nigga and the margin is wild
Floetry, the same as Marsh' and them now
Too bad the martian is out
What song savin’ him when we in bargin’ in wild?
Singers lose, better go and check Debarge and 'em now
We heating up, you know the fire marshall in doubt
Iron and irony, I ain't spoke to Marshall in a while
He said ""Budden get your stuff together
You busy ruffling feathers""
Bound to happen when you target an owl
Now we not enemies, he just gotta bar up now
I'm still on energy, let's see if he charged up now
And I'll be sure he's in the secret garden I found
With lions, tigers, bears, Tahiry, dolphins, wow

You wonder why
Bounce
You wonder why
Bounce
You wonder why
Bounce
Just because
Come on
Bounce with me now
Bounce
You wonder why
Bounce
You wonder why
Bounce with me now
I just love you man
It's all out of love
You wonder why
You wonder why
You wonder why

Devil In My Room,#SomeLoveSeries,2014.0,"Last night I heard a voice say I've been getting in my own way
I think I'm falling off the deep end so I haven't been sleepin'
Last night I heard a voice in my head
Said it's an emergency, said he had some work for me

He said fuck the world or maybe he said it in jest
I told him that I already did multiple times
Truthfully I wasn't never impressed
But to contradict that matter again
To the point where nothing matters again
More money, more problems, more cases, more lawyers involved
And more fame just means more paranoia involved
I done made friends, lost friends, same hour
Tried to use my truths as a means to gain power
Uh, same tricks, same cowards
Why I be like fuck any nigga that ain't ours
Never slipping, never threatened
I think they forgetting for a second non-fiction ain't a weapon
Thoughts could be hypnotic, nah, just neurotic
Called oft psychotic, flawed by off logic, but I got this

Last night I saw the devil sitting in my room
And we greeted with a smile
Said that he'd been there for a while
Last night I heard the devil talking in my head
Said this an emergency
Said he had some words for me
He said

He said
He said one day your friends gon' be your demise
Said a few of 'em is me in disguise
Deceit in his eyes, said I like the teaching me wise
But the leeches I don't need in my life, please be advised
Real coy, listening, still annoyed
Said these hoes fill a void of holes you still avoid
Said you searching, you don't know what to do
You thinking you fucking 'em when really they fucking you
Look, said they see you and feast
Said you give the love to the ones that need it the least
But wait, you can't put me on trial for my errors
I learned, trial and error, the how I couldn't tell ya
You talking to the realest, nah, just a realist
Nah, you just a nigga don't recognize what the real is
Thoughts could be hypnotic, thoughts get out of pocket
You'll be powerless, get lost, you try to stop it, I got this

Last night I saw the devil sitting in my room
And we greeted with a smile
Said that he'd been there for a while
Last night I heard the devil talking in my head
Said this an emergency
Said he had some words for me
He said

He said, ""What you doin' this music for?
I got news for ya
If you don't sell your soul to me then you just gon' ruin your future, bruh
See, I just cracked open this Goose
And I mixed that elixir with juice then I was introduced to Lucifer
In a dark room, his tongue sharp as a harpoon
We started discussin' things
He told me 'bout his minions and his underlings
Told me that he was Geppetto of the ghetto
Had snake niggas on his puppet strings, taught him betrayal and other schemes
He ain't new to this, he true to this
Said he been doin' this since Jesus was crossed
For thirty pieces of silver and he sealed the deal with a Judas kiss
When Caesar was stabbed in the back
He was the one who placed the knife in Brutus fist
Now he got his hands in our music biz (he said)
Told me to ignore the war on the poor
Aim my music more towards the whores and drug lords
And the fans'll pour through the doors
Sell out my tours, get awards galore
I told him I just wanted to be the modern day Marvin Gaye
He said, ""You might wanna rethink that
'Cause I know where your father stay, I'll possess him
To pick up the chrome, pop you in your dome for tryna tell the people what's goin' on""
He said, ""That's where you goin' wrong
There's more demons than angels in this biz, you on your own
Wanna hit the big screen? Switch your sixteens
Get some slim jeans, forget your big dreams, I'll make your wrist gleam
Get your big cream, hope you're lis'ning""
I just had to switch to his team, uh, it was tempting
The contract was in blood
He said, ""I know you sick of trafficking drugs - sign it""
""Nah, I got this""

Last night I saw the devil sitting in my room
And we greeted with a smile
Said that he'd been there for a while
Last night I heard the devil talking in my head
Said this an emergency
Said he had some words for me
He said

Last night I heard a voice say I've been getting in my own way
I think I'm falling off the deep end so I haven't been sleepin'
Last night I heard a voice in my head
Said it's an emergency, said he had some work for me

I think the weed started fucking with a nigga",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-devil-in-my-room-lyrics
Remember the Titans,Mood Muzik 4: A Turn 4 The Worst,2010.0,"Yeah, yeah
These niggas losing their minds, you find that there's no reward
They say they already home, it’s really clear they abroad
They sound like they boxed in, it’s not just where they record
There’s a cost to be a boss they can’t clearly afford
Swear to the Lord, there's guns like a audience
You put on a show, my .40 clearly applauds
Sitting fifth row, I might appear to be bored
Plotting on a Kanye, but screaming, ""Where’s my award?""
Balling out of control, never won an ESPY
'Bout to buy a black ghost and name that shit SP
Flow outta this world, I’m coming for my Moon Man
You niggas slide back like that walking on the moon dance
No glitter glean, handgun with a beam
Have some boys follow you, Street Fam, Twitter team
Like you could fuck with me, oh did it seem?
Dr. King and Def Jam ain't the only ones with a dream
I’m a grown ass man, this kid a teen
You’re a spoof of me like if hip hop did a Scream
Audi coupe looking good so I went and copped it
Got that TT popping like a trending topic
My ride's matte black, my pride is that jacked
It might get ya dog shot, even a cat smacked
Anyway though, styles don’t apply to me
Jeff Goldblum couldn’t be more fly than me
Shorty say, ""Right after the suck, fuck, poof""
You hit it on the head girl, duck duck goose
You shoulda got the message that I chuck up deuce
Break 'em off and leave it, you seen my fucked up tooth
It’s fuck a bitch, it’s more fish in the aquarium
I rarely hear no, like when niggas ask you to marry them
There’s no lights in the place you buy your jewelry from
Funeral Fab, I’m just here to bury them

Reporting live from the Beacon, booth tired from the beating
Had foreplay all day, prepping the beat and the mic for a threesome
With my vocal bi-coastal, speeding 'til the ride's totaled
Mr. Wi-Fi, out a franchise go to magic, standby local’s
Watch the track bust once I show my dick size to the Pro-Tools
I teach you how to have models screaming, ""Get behind me""
E-pills and Maybachs ain't gon' matter if your tip is tiny
Never mind me, we could get knee deep in the beef
Seek me with the heat but you’ll need more to keep me on a leash
Here’s a CC for the peeps that wanna see me in the streets
Invest in Rockports and be easy on your feet
Give a few hammers, a few semi’s and a few snubs
To a few Crips, couple vampires and true Bloods
Gambling in casinos, have a honey handing me my c-notes
The modern day Gambino, I’m careful every step I take
You the nigga walk up in a shootout with some pepper spray
That’d be the last mistake you ever made
Me, I chop his head off from a rooftop
And race it downstairs just to see if I can catch his fade
Like groceries when I’m shooting at fags
Make sure the bread's separated and put the fruits in a bag
Withstand the hatred, dudes is fallin off doin all they can to save it
But everybody's run stops, ask Brandon Jacobs
What y’all call swag to me is all faggotry
Fours want blast at me, that’d equal more casualties
Abort the strategy or get attacked with that Duracell
They put in your back, now that's assault and battery
You can keep the bitching to yourself
There’s beams on every burner, these lasers, a petition wouldn’t help
What good is having shooters if they the type that miss?
Where I’m from, better be careful where you drive that whip
Niggas put they life at risk for pies they flip
In my town, Ben Affleck wouldn't try that shit
And if he did he’d get turned around, burnt down
Tell the new jacks it’ll be a while 'fore they eligible to earn the crown

Acid out the baggie, this is more than dope, flawless flow
Fucking off a sign every horoscope done wore my robes
Strapping up the corner cold, critical
Unquestioned, my opponents know
I shoot like Kapono, watch me own the show
Comatose, toasted, getting money while I roam the coast
Stones and boats, mansion homes and hoes
I deserve ‘em both, overdose
Time to earn my votes, watch me turn the volts
Voltage through a meter, this electric chair, danger
Yeah, I see ya, now make way 'fore it turn to diarrhea
Hear a microphone will give you 3 of everything I wear yeah
Models by the pair, swear, bottles, private Lear, steer
Style that's outta here, rare, thousands by the chair, square
Sleep with me, you came here, war with me is scary
Get beat silly trying to lamp here, better bring your fury heat
I got a drop damp here, niggas try me barely
No one breathes, I need an ant's ear, pressure's necessary
Got my mind on the cheddar, kill my haters together
Bury 'em in abundance and starve their families stomach’s
Paper come in my thumbage, brand new fifties and hundreds
On point, just like the drum is, I’m warning them baby mothers
Got the hunger of a broke rapper
Kill you while I’m rolling up then smoke after
Catch you at your show, snatch ya, empty out the dough faster
Bentley off the scene, magnum Mo' splasher, four packer
Southside nigga spitting coke at ya!

Nickel! This is for the fronters and the naysayers
I’m about to scare away the drummers and the bass players
They say I’m out of my league on this one, so when I get done
I want you to cut your fuckin' ears off and Twitpic ‘em!
Lord, I want you to leave this vicinity
You gon' be around here 'bout long as Justin Bieber’s virginity
This is Jesus identity, mixed with weed, Hennessy, Kennedy, King
Mixed with a kill or be killed killer regime, illest you seen, switch
Y’all write all that hard shit then you fall right off, it’s horrible
My oracle is all I offer, so before I borrow your
'Won’t be here tomorrow' flow, sorry, I will prob'y
Adiós my body wit' somebody toast, this shit just practice
Sickest rapping Baptist, kill your pastor
Steal your Chapstick, after that make you kiss a cactus
Then take your ho, make the ho give the whole clique fellatio
Everyone, that wasn’t the whole entourage on HBO
Then after that, I tell her, ""I can’t do much with you, shawty!
I just found out I could fly to Dubai and hire Buffie the Body!""
Don't call us if the bitches ain’t flawless
If they are then we can hang like Aretha Franklin bra-less
The drunk me can box like a sober you
The sober me be more nervous than Waka Flocka in the voting booth
We beef like being deep and dumping K’s
You beef like Lady Gaga and her stylist
Y’all get together to look good in front of a bunch of gays
My feng shui is a pump in the desert
You’ll come up shorter than an Asian jumping out of a trunk in the desert
While my wolfpack looks for strippers and cocaine
Niggas snitching, it’s a shame, we call 'em male tattlers
Fiends touching they noses more than URL battlers
It’s hard to spit saliva when you spit fire, so I’ll just
Pour sugar in your gas tank, put a banana in your tailpipe
Ah ha, so the car can fit the driver",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-remember-the-titans-lyrics
Pain Won’t Stop,A Loose Quarter,2012,"Oh, the pain won’t stop (the pain don’t stop)
Almost like it’s got a hold on me (on me)
Shackles and cuffs
I can be no more than a slave
And still the pain won’t stop
Like my demons got control of me
Won’t take me alive
I guess someone’s gonna see the grave

And it won't be me, and it can’t be me
And it won’t be me, I won’t let it be me
And it won’t be me, and it can’t be me
And it won’t be me, I won’t let it be me

I’m starin' at the pain in the mirror – or is it a facsimile?
Question hurts more than the fact that it resembles me
Thought I left 'em all in the past, I mean essentially
So when we side by side I just act like it’s all a memory
And then I got a whole market of fans
With no clue what I speak of, but some of y'all understand
If you knew about my woes you wouldn’t target the man
And if you did it’d be about more than a marketing plan
I got a heart that’s ice cold, I’ve been tryin' to melt
It's talent, honest to y'all all while lyin' to myself
Seem like I do the most damage all when tryin' to help
And no one asked for it, I decided myself
You think the road a nigga traveled
Has been long enough for y'all to see the winner in him?
Don’t know if I’m fightin' my demons or goin' to dinner with em
I sit across from that table just lookin' brave and tough
But it’s only right they get the check, figured that I paid enough

Oh, the pain won’t stop (the pain don’t stop)
Almost like it’s got a hold on me (on me)
Shackles and cuffs
I can be no more than a slave
And still the pain won’t stop
Like my demons got control of me
Won’t take me alive
I guess someone’s gonna see the grave

Fans say they waitin' on a break up, don’t want me at the altar
But how would their lives alter, I figure how could they fault ya?
Followed me in this business
You witnessed me go through torture
With my exes, so a death wish I wouldn’t want anymore
Begs the question what do niggas really want in me?
Couldn’t be as simple as misery lovin' company
Can’t be as cliché as bein' a gift and a curse
But how could you ever claim
To love someone, then wish him the worst?
It appears my happiness has some people resentin' me
Should I appreciate love that come with contingencies?
Y'all get mad whenever someone else mentions me
Ironic, got a ex that’s showin' similar tendencies
Spite stems from hate, I try to never be near it
Do you only want the best for Joe when we could share it?
That can become obsessive like you wouldn’t believe
Don’t take my word, just look at what happened to Steve
It got Raqi lookin' rocky, had 'em by me
And I watched 'em both deteriorate, was ugly
If you trust me, then you wouldn’t want to share their fate
And so it seems the people I'd jump in the casket for
Their mind’s playin' tricks, I wish they knew they mattered more
Would they ask for more or would that will subside?
Poured my heart out all these years, I’m shocked I'm still alive
Tell him like I told Stack, it gets no realer
You love somethin' too much, guarantee it'll kill ya, for real

Oh, the pain won’t stop (the pain don’t stop)
Almost like it’s got a hold on me (on me)
Shackles and cuffs
I can be no more than a slave
And still the pain won’t stop
Like my demons got control of me
Won’t take me alive
I guess someone’s gonna see the grave

I crashed a million times, still I’m without a dent
They come to me to air it out, but I’m without a vent
I have nightmares about the shit I thought I said
Cried enough that Posturepedic is a waterbed
Look at you like a nobody, it ain’t much I could ask of you
And I'd give you a hand, but what the fuck would you attach it to?
Finish one chore, God will throw you some more shit
It’s not enough I’m fightin' mine, still I battle your shit

Oh, the pain won’t stop (the pain don’t stop)
Almost like it’s got a hold on me (on me)
Shackles and cuffs
I can be no more than a slave
And still the pain won’t stop
Like my demons got control of me
Won’t take me alive
I guess someone’s gonna see the grave

And it won't be me, and it can’t be me
And it won’t be me, I won’t let it be me
And it won’t be me, and it can’t be me
And it won’t be me, I won’t let it be me",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-pain-wont-stop-lyrics
So Good,A Loose Quarter,2012,"Niggas be like
Niggas be like
They like, ""Why you cuffin' so hard?""
And I be like, ""Why you not?""
Grown man shit though
It's a cold winter, niggas they gon' keep you warm at night
Make you breakfast in the morning
And I ain't in love, love is in me, you hear?

I've been thinkin' 'bout you every day
These other bitches, they can't change us
And I don't need 'em in the way
'Cause no one ever fucked me so good
Your love is… your touch is…
My spot get…
No one ever fucked me so good

Look, let's talk a different type of lavish now
Not sure actually, a different type of baggage now
Your home girls quick to paint me as a savage now
You quick to know them bitter hoes, wish they had this now
Back to you, this song of mine, no it's unsung
Not a trophy, that'd imply I only won once
I'm off the pass miss if every guy before me once practiced
Then I don't need no real game to know
We should be more than just 
so on and done
And my baby like girls too
So every night we get in bed with another bitch
She start screamin', gettin' head from another bitch
And no, it's just a porno, in our heads it's another bitch
Yeah, but it's more than just the sex to me
Panic when I wake up and she ain't next to me
So I go out of my way to give her the best of me
Love me so much shorty even want the rest of me

I've been thinkin' 'bout you every day
These other bitches, they can't change us
And I don't need 'em in the way
'Cause no one ever fucked me so good
Your love is… your touch is…
My spot get…
No one ever fucked me so good

We hit the strip club, I respect a different taste
That's how stacks and ones end up in a disarray
These other broads used to transform my livin' space
Into solitary confinement prison space
They think we actin' though, I tell 'em we're not frontin'
Give her somethin' of everything 'cause she used to a lot of nothin'
We take our clothes off, get the spot, jump in it
She come multiple times like she forgot somethin'
Yeah, unlike any other guy she dated
She my world and I'm cool with bein' isolated
I swear to God all I need is you
If love hurts all I bleed is you
Tell me if you wanna see that through
We could coop it when I'm with you
Get back all I put in to recuperate an issue
Let me sum it up for those of y'all that ask why
I cherish the ground she walk on but she that fly

I've been thinkin' 'bout you every day
These other bitches, they can't change us
And I don't need 'em in the way
'Cause no one ever fucked me so good
Your love is… your touch is…
My spot get…
No one ever fucked me so good

It's really as simple as this
The woman that they would fuck I wouldn't
The woman I wouldn't fuck they would
What that means is the niggas y'all think is fly don't
So I move in my own pace
(So good… so good…)
Fortunately for me I done been all around the world and met
Met so many different types of women
I picked mine, I got the one I like
Even better than that, I got the one I love
Y'all get these other hoes
Been there, done that, wasn't that fun
(So good… so good…)
(So good… so good…)
You gotta be on some
You gotta be on some grown shit
To understand this shit that I'm talkin' 'bout though
You gotta be on some grown shit
To have the type of sex that I'm talkin' 'bout
(So good… so good…)
(So good… so good…)
Y'all bedsex niggas, I'm rooftop
Five star suite and I don't mean considerate and kind
Ya mean?
Love you, baby
I love you too, babe
Take 'em to church, uh
Here's a jewel, I'ma give it to y'all
Same way it was given to me
Real niggas don't fall in love, we stand up in it
Thank God for you",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-so-good-lyrics
Slaughterhouse,Halfway House,2008.0,"Joey what you said, 24 right
Aight cool, I got you
I define gutter - every time I rhyme
I climb up another notch, hip-hop got my spine smothered
But I'll be fine brother - my mind hovers
Above all you jive suckers wishing, that's word to my mother
You throw a shot at me, I'm throwing a shot back
Yours is on a joint, mine's whistling by your top hat
Yeah, I'm cool but you violate and I'll cock back
Open the mac's mouth and black out like I do not rap
I'm sick and tired of niggas lying
They fifth is lying in the second drawer next door to some bullshit they iron
Y'all be making up stories the little kids is buyin'
I do everything my Penn State like a Nittany Lion
I ain't gotta mention the streets on a song
To get in a nigga ass on these beats like a thong - pause
Veterans co-sign me, the up-and-comers scared
The pretty girls go, ""papi, here's my underwear""
Never in a hundred years I thought I'd be a rapper
But in less than a hundred bars I knew I'd be a factor
I'm PS4 in HD and the screen is plasma
You're Atari 2600 with a weak adapter
Between us the gap's so crazy
I'm Gucci, Louis V; you're Gap, Old Navy
I get coochie in the V, you attract no ladies
You're suburb, I'm gutter where the gats go crazy

Fuck a lecture, ain't tryna be Pun's successor
That term's done fucker, what up whatever
You birds is food, I'm about to pluck some feathers
I'm young and clever, plus clutch under pressure, yup
Who does this better
Walk around with metal all on me like the front of Shredder
I lust for cheddar you owe me
Leave holes in your vest that'll open your chest like a sunken treasure
I'm somethin' like a phenomenon
Dropping bombs for fun then dine in Hell during Ramadan
Whatever I'm rhyming on or whoever
I tear 'em apart; swear on my pops
No fear in my heart, shit been through it all
Done swam with the sharks, snapped fins with my jaws
I'm all that and a bag of the baddest piff
Off of a brick of hash mixed with acid hits like sick cracker shit
Get back, dumb birds I ignore the hype
Click-clack, Yung Berged if you flossing ice
Dawg, cross me twice, can't afford the price
It'll cost you, I'll off your life
You soft, I told you I'm raw white when I'm on this mic
Still mourn at night, don't wanna see mornin' light
And I feel like I'm forced to fight
When the CHiPs are down like Ponch fallin' off his bike
Of course my metaphors are type awesome, right
I got 'em in awe, my aura's Jordan like
What's really poppin', who diddy-boppin
You wasn't really, now you all Common and really conscious
I ain't with that silly nonsense, I really pop shit
My gun stay cocked like Biggie's optics
I stay evolving but grown bitter
On your grave they're carvin' ""Fucked with the wrong nigga""

I don't write I kill a pen, leak its blood on the page
I breathe bars like oxygen locked my lungs in a cage
Instrumentals get fucked on the stage
A pedophile unless I dig in the crates and fuck with somethin' my age
Forever vow, to never smile when I'm at peace
Only when I'm eating the deceased like quiche
Only when my enemy's internal organs are a smorgasbord in a feast
The Dahmer with melanin led 'em in the belly of the beast
You'll be missin' until fishermen see your corpse
I'll be in Michigan sticking a chicken in my Michelin
Ready to pigeon pitch again from Switzerland to New York
I was whipping Bentleys before them pictures up in The Source
I'm a gorilla behind these bars, on some zoo shit
Shoot you while you're talking on some news camera crew's shit
Sicker than flyin' in past tense on some flu shit
Day-old asshole flow, I drop new shit
Exclusive, you don't want it in fact
I'll have the doctors operating on the front of your back
Tryna keep your stomach intact
The spiritual you, leavin' your body, he don't wanna go back
That's when the tunnel go black
I send your soul to the atmosphere
Fuck outta here and your ringtone rap career
It's Crooked I: the face of Eastside Long Beach
Put your ear to the street so you can hear my heartbeat

Nickel, yeah
I hope niggas know I'll show up to your show
I'll show up where you go, show up to your do', foes will explode
Shells 'fore they hit the floor, I know niggas know
I got a open window flow, I air shit out
In the D they used to call me Mayor Royce
Now they call me Clay Davis
Guess why, ""sheeeeeeeeeeee-it""
'Cause when it come to them words you know I wear shit out
I write rhymes like, white lines on a nose tray
Ice cold Ice Cube flow like O'Shea
Ridin' shotgun with Chris Martin - my DJ
Not the White boy, but I'm down for the Coldplay
Forever stay violent, better stay silent
Hammers stay humming like strumming the mandolin violin
Speaking of, I done played a tune of violence
More than my nigga Charles Hamilton played Sonic
I wrap niggas up, clap niggas up, scrap niggas up
Either that or we gon' slap niggas up
Dump dirt on you right before I go
Into my Maino mode if I smell the scent of Yung Berg on ya
Til it ain't no mo', ain't no dough
Get into his ass cause I ain't opposed, I'm a livin' anal probe
I'm a lame-ophobe, matter fact my nigga JumpOff
Can I keep goin' (why the fuck not)
When I was a teen, I used to pack a three-eighty
Now I'm spittin sittin' between Shady and Jay
I pull the jeans down on my bitch and then wave
Cause the pussy Max B wavy when she ain't shave
I leave the booth smellin' like somebody ain't sprayed
I would talk about Kimbo but I ain't crazy
I'm like Marty McFly goin' back in time
And dissin' his momma nigga you can't fade me

They say he a bastard for real, then they see the ass on his girl
So they wonderin' why's he so mad at the world
I take it out on tracks, I R.I.P. it
So even to the producer it's hard to I.D. it
Bars tremendous, it's in your best interest
I insist your men just do your best Bush rendish
Endless, move more than two inches
My blood'll boil like I got a big skin cyst
So end this or see me mañana
Or see the speed of a llama, underground prima donna
That ain't hard to find, pop a E in a Honda
With hands like E. Honda, he a monster
I love war, it's like my pet peeve kinda
But for us to even beef you should be honored
My dick gettin' hard, I see vagina - pause
Nah, rewind each line each time
Speak mine and meet nine, mano-a-mano
When it rains it pours, grab a teflon poncho
You now fuckin' with Mouse, the head honcho
Nigga I could fit your house in my condo
I walk around like ratchets been legalized
Just me and the Desert Eagle, and an eagle eye
Closed casket, now you having a boxed wake
Zipper over your head, dude's callin' you Crotchface
So y'all could bump ""Swag Like Us""
But the next time rap's discussed add this as a plus
Don't nobody hit the pad like us
And would get up in that ass but the fag's might bust
And since poppin' tags is a must (what?)
I hit the bank all I do is withdraw
Chicks removin' their drawers now, your crew is in awe
How you ball, your jewels from a cubicle in the mall
You gon' need another processor to process it
I'll set it, I said it
So keep running around hot-headed 'til you get hot leaded
'Til everything but your torso on you is prosthetic
Digest it, niggas is pie-thetic
Rap what you can't afford, y'all must got credit
All you gotta know is Crooked I, Royce, Bless and Joell

No Love Lost (Outro),No Love Lost,2013.0,"Mic check, mic check 1-2 1-2
Made a lot of mishaps, lot of mistakes, lot of missteps
Grown shit though, is when you can recognize that
And I recognize that, and real recognize that
Talk to em...

Last word, check it, unbeatable force, insurmountable object
Bull should've known better than counting me out, I'm from the projects
So if I ever do it for greed, indeed something is wrong
Prepare for the future, remember I used to get heat from the oven on
They wanted to see Budden gone, fiend'd out on sour
But nobody helped put Budden on, had to bring my own power so
I'm having a private party, that only myself attends
And if the DJ plays the song to my soul, it'll give itself a cleanse
They telling me all the pain I ever felt was self-infringed
But I had help from friends, one even held the syringe
Architect of my own path, I'd like to think it's designed the best
Defied the odds, I never aged while giving time a test
No niggas on house arrest, I'm on a minor rest
You trying to call me or text me, don't even bother
I'm trying to give mind a rest
I got a treasure but its content is invisible
Was filled before with shit that I thought I treasured, but made me miserable
My affairs together, here forever, yeah I'm back to work
Learned in order to lose love, probably gotta have it first

My life's a crap shoot, my dice are loaded, ain't no stopping me
Most interesting man, a hard place is between a rock and me
I'm torn within, and my eyes are heavy
I'm born again, just means I died already
Means I survived already, so fuck they want with me?
World been against me so long, 
misery hates my company
Isolated my whole life, not many know who Joseph is
In order to reciprocate love, you gotta notice it
Gotta recognize it, gotta feel it first
Gotta be let inside it, feel its hurt and then kneel to its worst
If you contain it, don't hide it, gotta reveal it first
And when you think you hit rock bottom, gotta feel it worse
Or, my rule book is just dated
And for you to truly appreciate it, you gotta at least be hated
Mama I made it, if anyone know my way was hard
They prayed for my Downfall on deaf ears, I was praying to God
So God, I loved love till it resented me
And if it's still a stranger, then I love who it pretends to be

No Love Lost
No love found
They found a little bit though
I don't know where they found it out, but it was there
So I guess the moral of the story
Is as you mature, so will it
Just gotta find it

Dear Diary,Mood Muzik Vol. 3.5 ,2007.0,"It's five o'clock, I'm just getting home
Roaming on my own
What can I tell her
That she might understand?

The soundtrack to my life is like CNN first shit
Images like CNN but worse shit
I would down the whole Pinot Gris
But I'd see the group home without the Primo beats
And it hurts my soul
I'm a warrior so though the odds is against a nigga, Dirk gon' choke
Some people confide in the person that they sleep with
I've learned there's no such thing as a secret (oh)
I can't describe the feeling I get
You was riding shotgun, I was wheeling the whip
Shit, I even let you rock out, 
being Bill Belichick
Tapin' from the sidelines, stealin' my shit
But dawg, you was like a mini me, mocked me, envied me
Turns out you was blowin' hot air, Kenny G
But you was cool, accepted you instantly
Not a groupie but you had a few tendencies
And though we share a few memories
Couple wrong turns'll turn a friend to an enemy
See, phony people like phony people
Even you could be mistaken if you phone these people
, look
When you invite the nerds to the cool table
Shit is bound to break up like a pool table
So wack dudes'll start feeling like the shit
And you thinkin' it's you, it's really where you sit
Or maybe you was neglected
'Cause when you take the front down and strip a nigga naked, he's dying to be accepted (oh)
I did that, just the way you was
Now you a stranger, nothing like the way you was
But uh, you not real, you not Rachel
You not Worm, you not Dill, shit, you not chill
I thought you had some couth
Fuck the fake shit, I'm really feel that you tryna screw me
And you a little smarter than the average dude
So it took a nigga just a little longer to see
They tried to warn me, fought with my girl erry night about you
Shit only hurts cause she was right about you
She run around wanting to shoot you the fair one
I keep telling her ""chill, I don't care none""
I got another side I never showed to you
The side where everybody is disposable
See, relationships are never a threat
Cause I'll erase the history and act like we never met
Become done giving a fuck and done calling
I got your e-mail, I was done way before then (oh)
Dear Diary, I don't wanna keep shit inside of me
I'd rather just speak to you privately
Maybe it's my mood, as far as I can see
There's really no point in having this guy with me
Change from the days of us getting in your truck
It's bigger than one song, it's bigger than a buck
It's bigger than me, bigger than buck
Bigger than voodoo, its bigger than 
luck
, shit, it's bigger than us
I always call niggas fools for wanting to learn the hard way (when)
When I'm really the fool for tryna teach 'em
When the blinds leading the blind you can't reach 'em
If niggas ain't as hungry as you then why feed 'em?
Niggas ain't tryna be lead then why lead 'em?
Having big problems with your dogs, why breed em?
I'll keep my part up, keep my guard up
Was like Thundercats but changed faster than Cheetara
This a small part of a larger issue
Sometimes acceptance is so hard to get to
But we all equal, no one lower or above me
I love my team just as much as they love me
If not more
If I turn the knob we all going through the door, I ain't coming back for y'all
The whole crew feel the same as me
How could you ignore something so plain to see?
I'm being ig'nant, that get on my nerves every minute
What's plain to some is really Burberry printed
Being so real sometimes is a slow kill
We was one squad, you broke out like Mike Schofield
I want fillet mignon, you want oatmeal
Add up our differences equals up to no meal
No mills, yup, no deal, why you gotta chase sh*t
To know it's no thrills, for rea

A nigga still beefin' with his baby momma (BUT!)
Only thing my baby ain't a baby no more
Hit her on MySpace, maybe she ain't shady no more
Sent old girl a message, no reply but she read it
Some things are so embedded and our heads is
Looking for O's but get X's, dealing wit ya exes
I was one long line away from the Tetris
She sent me the L, that sent me to hell
To the point where I’m denied my son
I don't see him, don't talk to him, I don't greet him, don't walk wit' him
But I pay for him like he's an object
No matter how right I am, in court I can't object
Dear Diary, how could she deny me?
How she go to bed without it fucking with her psyche?
Is she wrong using him so I can come back? (or)
Am I wrong for wishing I could get my cum back?
Looking for sun, all I see is the hail
How I'm gon' trust? All I see is betrayal
It's like they keep trying more and more to subdue me
And only you understand, signed by yours truly",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-dear-diary-lyrics
Runaway,No Love Lost,2013.0,"I said all that I'll say, so I stand with no apologies
I've popped all that I popped, wasn't too recently that it got to me
Those of yall that love Joe, gotta admit the shit was a lot to see
Today I take all of the credit like I did away with modesty
I lost weight, lost faith, I got caught up in that vacuum
My stomach turned and my eyes burned, 
and I became best friends with the bathroom
Today it takes all the strength I have inside for me to avoid the rush
Face pokered over the toilet, all you hear is a royal flush
Was under the control, though they warned me about addiction
Mine manifested again in the form of a prescription
And it's funny what the effects of that little pill'll do
Funny shit that keeps you alive can also kill you
But it's my life, guess I'm stuck in it
Sometimes I wanna just be normal like them other kids
The demon I battle with every night is simply drugs and shit
But I'll runaway from it all if God deems that I've had enough of it

They say don't get lost, follow the leader
And don't do that, be a believer
When the sun goes down, you better hide
It's a dangerous world, better stay inside and
Run along, run along
It's a long long way, home from here
Run along, run along
It's a long long way, home from here, yeah

Uh, it go, look
How come they can roll? God tell me how come they can smoke, they can drink?
They get to do whatever they want and it don't interrupt the way they think
They all get to be regular, why is it only me this odd?
Me who can't even stand up straight
, me who can't even keep a job
Maybe I'm asking for too much, a tiny piece of normalcy
Or an answer to any one of my fucking prayers that's asking what's wrong with me
Maybe I'm tired of being unique, tired of being that outcast
I'm tired of me being the only one, 
so tired of you all not knowing about that
I'm tired of it all, want me to fall a spectacle, for the crowd to see
Or being the only one with faith, I'm tired of everybody doubting me
I'm tired of responding to grown ass folks that think so motha fuckin childishly
Aches, wish I could take my parents' genes the fuck up out of me
Tired of wanting to run somewhere, tired of having to bare it all
Tired of you fucks constantly taking from me and I'm willing to share it all
Tired of being objective, I'm tired of having to hear it all
But being alone is the only way I know to never be near it all

They say don't get lost, follow the leader
And don't do that, be a believer
When the sun goes down, you better hide
It's a dangerous world, better stay inside and
Run along, run along
It's a long long way, home from here
Run along, run along
It's a long long way, home from here, yeah",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-runaway-lyrics
Tell Him Somethin’,No Love Lost,2013.0,"Tell him something
Say whatever you think he'd wanna hear girl
If it don't come between me, you and this mirror girl
I don't care girl
Just tell him something
Tell him something
Tell him something
Let him know a real nigga is fuckin you
But that'll probably make you feel uncomfortable
Whatchu gonna do?
Tell him something
Tell him something

It's crazy, it's crazy
How he got your brain
But his body don't do a damn thing for you
Now oh baby, oh baby
Been trying to get away
Cause you know I do the things he won't do

You can tell him that we best of friends, or we just met
Tell him that you hate my guts, that was just sex
Can say we never kissed, those were just pecks
Tell him put your phone down, that was just a text
Or, tell him you cherish our bond on the weekly
Or how you jump in my arms when you see me
Tell him I threw on the charm it was easy
It's to the point now where your mom wanna meet me
Tell him I think you're beautiful
Tell him all the wild shit that I do to you
Would he approve of that? Or would his world be shattered?
And if you didn't care would it really matter?
Wait, could say it ain't the ride or the whips
But tell him the size of the ship
Or, just tell him you were tired of his shit
And I reminded you of how live it gets


Tell him you don't feel appreciated
Tell him with me it's alleviated
Incomparable
How I do things that he wouldn't dare to do
Or act like I ain't affraid to take it there with you
Wait, as a matter a fact
Tell him he could be mad at the fact
You finally met a nigga that ain't mad at your past
Or tell him he can be mad at the past


You get his call and he asks what you doing just say, ""With your friends""
And while you on that phone waiting for him to hang up, girl, I'll be here
Ready to take over
Your body's yearning for what he can't give
And I know just how y'all's story gon' end
Once I give it to you, babe


Tell him you mourn him, tell him you're on it, tell him you can't see, your life without me
Tell him he's deaded now, all because I'm alive
Tell him it's wetter now
 and you love it when I'm inside
Tell him you like your hair pulled, tell him you like my tongue there
Tell him in detail, make sure you not unclear cause he gotta know, cause he gotta know",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-tell-him-somethin-lyrics
The Way You Love Me,Some Love Lost,2014.0,"Turn me up in the headphone something
(New Joe Budden)
Look

First off let me shout out the fam, y'all so gracious
Been chilling in the room for growth, it's so spacious
Getting to the money, counting these old faces
Like I found the smoking gun in cold cases (nah)
Them dark thoughts never got to 'em still
I'm like the legendary Robin Will
Even though I understand
I never dealt with the pain like that
A knot from that same rope
But I don't hang like that
We had a couple break-ups
Gotta respect Cuzz and I'll hit the reset button
You try to reset Budden, it's real
My accomplishments
Already show 'em how I deal with the consequence
And you can ask Consequence
She reached out via text like ""What up with the guy?""
Which is weird, it's been a year
Since we fraternized
Still I made my way back in her life
Only to prove to myself I wouldn't fuck up twice
We reminiscing, thinking hella back
You had to watch me with her but to hell with that
Cause I think that me carrying that thought
Kind of washed me with her
And even that's cool cause me and you is not me and her
I took a little hiatus, hope you could see the change
I was too high to say this, how could I explain?
Though my mouth was quiet
My mind was like a Ferguson riot
Why it only get worse when I'm in private
Were we victims to the game
Trying to do it over
Here's the gift for an exchange
It's timeout for the public
These niggas won't know a thing
So we keep each other blocked on Twitter
It's not a game
Like a picture in a frame for now
Drunk models, couple Swishers and a stack here

Everytime I walk away, you need me
But your words don't mean a thing when you're not here
Tell me is this the way
The way that you love me
Tell me is this the way
The way that you care

She said she wanna set boundaries
Can't continue to have you surrounding me
Cause that'll lead to you on this couch pounding me
That'll bring them feelings back
That's just out of bounds to me
It's been years, last bitch ain't come around to me
Send my tone of voice down
Like you speaking down to me
Said I said some things to begrudge you
But I can't ask to not be judged then judge you
She said; all this time I've been screaming ""Fuck You""
When she implies I can't move on I'm stuck too
Blood flowing, there's an adrenaline rush too
Every time I'm tryna leave
It's when you're in a rush too
She said; looking back I can see how you was gaming me
Which is fine, I can see how you could feel there
Which means I just gotta ask you one question though
If it was game tell me why them feelings still there?
I know the answer to that: you still fallin'
You ain't never felt so strong, it feels foreign
Probably got me saved in her phone as Phil Collins
Hear it in the air of the night it's still callin'
Every time you see me a couple of bills on him
Got rich then did it again we still ballin'
You ain't gotta respond to that
If you did it would look like it's a con to that
I'm so far beyond of that
Chillin' with a couple of hoes that like hoes
That like niggas that don't act like hoes
I don't say that cause I'm vain
Or some strangers can know I'm the man
We not fucking
Sometimes it's better knowing you can't
She come running back
Every time she throw in the can
Just to holla when she feel like not a soul understand
Baby, I already proved that I ride out
You can't bear to be hurt again so you hide out
You ain't gotta say that, I know you inside out
We communicate so well when all the pride's out
You gotta give it one more go, we ain't tried out
Nah that love wouldn't a been real if it died out

Uh
Let the sample ride
Dim the lights in this motherfuckin booth
Uh

If I had a choice, I rather my higher power decide to take me first (why?)
I think the other way around would only make me worse
Rarely was I ever trusted without the suspicions
And very few could ever love me without some conditions (hey!)
Those the ones I care to treasure, ones I wouldn't dare sever
A bunch of my peers efforts been fair weather (if the)
If the deaf got great vision and a blind man could hear better
Figured since I lost all my senses that I would fair better
I'm not the social type, nothin about him socialite
Designed the prototype, how to unlove overnight
Flip side, I die for my niggas, put it the simplest
You give me your all and I'm a send it back with interest
This for my niggas that'll help me before I suggest it
I'm just tryin to send the flowers before you congested
The man in fact that I've become y'all had a hand in that
And I'll give y'all the world but I'm sure that y'all would hand it back
 - w/ ad libs
We will never be apart
It's like two bodies, livin with one heart
Together like a lock and key
Without you, there is no me
Things will never be the same
If you ain't here with me
I couldn't see
Livin another day
Wherever you go
You know that I'm going with you (with you)
With you (with you), with you
You know that I'm going with you (with you)
With you (with you), with you (with you)

I mean,...she was on the phone tryin to sound relaxed (what?)
But the words comin out her mouth ain't have the sound to match (nah)
Voice tremblin as if you were barely holdin on
Meanwhile tryin to be strong to protect your second born
Shit was scary to me
If somethin happened to you, it'll happen to us, like I'm livin vicariously
I seen your life flash, right past, my reaction buried deep inside
If you go, they'll have to bury me alive
How would I survive? Fuck a mom you meant more
Life coach and mentor, just a grim thought makes my skin crawl
Single mother, held it down when my pop was locked away
Cried every time I gave my mom a gift on Father's Day (talk to 'em)
But I'll be there for you, like you was there for yours
As she was layin, decayin, all her days spent prayin (uh)
Gospel music playin (uh)
A few days from death but always felt us on our way in, we was like her safe haven (ah!)
You always thought you were her least favorite child
Only sibling that showed up to at least make her smile
At least make her proud, not an obstacle that's too hard
True stars strive to be half of the person you are
Ain't never neglect, so I'll forever respect
I owe more than my life to you, I'm forever in debt, check
I mean my mother got cancer in her neck
But I'll be right behind you every step, what the fuck did you expect?
 - w/ ad libs

I'm like, damn, how you always know better than me?
Amazes me when you show me what I never could see
So the break up never really was a plan to me
In retrospect, I think I was complacent with insanity
We were so exhausted, bored with, tortured
But since I couldn't picture my life without you, I forded it (like what?)
Like we could get through anything, it's too much pride in us
Better off without each other, I'd have been deprivin us
At times you see people in ways you shouldn't portray 'em
Cause they ain't livin up to a title you shouldn't of gave 'em
Head shot, pointblank range, committed murder
Honestly thought I couldn't move on, then went further
Used to want to see you suffer for that pain you caused
Now when I see you gain, I applaud
What I'm tryin to say is (what?)
Don't complain about your path and where it took you
Cause you might end up with somebody to sing this hook to

Aftermath,Mood Muzik 4: A Turn 4 The Worst,2010," (*echo*)
You ain't gonna believe this
But you used to fit right here
I'd hold you up, and say to your mother
""This kid's gonna be the best kid in the world
This kid's gonna be somebody better than anybody I ever knew""
And you grew up good and wonderful
It was great just watching you every day, it was like a privilage
Then the time come for you to be your own man
And take on the world, and you did
But somewhere along the line, you changed
You stopped being you

It's, it's, it's that On Top Music!

Look, look, look, shout to all my fans, glad I can inspire y'all
Got a couple haters, still tryin to acquire more
You're prayin to a higher power, hopin I should fall
But even my writer's block, ends in a firewall
Everybody acts reckless, judgin by they past efforts
If they ran shit, why it won't show up on they track records? (talk to 'em)
How could the critics ever hear me and say I'm a suffer?
How when they play with words and I make 'em play with each other?
Choppers over the booth, ready for prime time
Become one with his thoughts, intertwine with his mind
Go toe to toe, blow for blow or do it rhyme for rhyme
Be competitive coke heads and go line for line
Honestly that crap of yours, you should raffle off
With me they gettin Genius Bars without the Apple store
Under the microscope, I rebut' the scrutiny
If I'm to be compared, it's only to who I used to be
Take a closer look at rappers and you might discover
These faggots talking boxing, avoid the Mike Buffers
Now you the type to cuff her, me I get tired of her
See you the type get hyped to hug her but won't try to fuck her
Them pencil thin bitches, me that ain't the style he dates
Mine sit on the bed and leave an imprint of a smiley face
To introduce the newcomers to my habitat
The calm's before the storm, this the debris from the aftermath (aftermath)

Let me tell you something you already know
The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows
It's a very mean and nasty place and I don't care how tough you are
It will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it
You, me or nobody, is gonna hit as hard as life
But it ain't about how hard ya hit
It's about how hard you can get it and keep moving forward

Check it, check, check it, let me change pace
The alternate route's a long one but you'll ultimately end up in the same place
So I tell aspiring artists ""think beyond greater""
I know some niggas with platinum plaques and bronze paper
But better livin should be earned, never fed or givin
So I traded my recognition instead for a vision
They always told me that I'd end up dead or in prison
Who ever thought that same dude gettin head while he whippin
That the chicks would hang up on? Give 'em the dial tone
Now buyin wild homes, straight cash without loans
I always managed to do better when there's doubt shown
I'll teach you how to turn them diamonds into milestones
Class is in session and look who's come to tutor
They passin the fake off as real like Brian Pumper's jeweler
Where I'm from niggas with fear gettin slumped by shooters
But my equal to dumpin Rugers is done by computers
I'm gettin bread, every verse like the lotto
Give 'em substance but they treat every word like it's a hollow (blaat)
My niggas off parole, I'm tryin to give 'em somethin pure to follow
Cause he ain't have a pot to piss in, just a urine bottle
I come from where so many people were raised with neglect
Cops tryin to meet they quota, thirsty to make an arrest
All my wrongdoings did, was put my faith to a test
Which made me much stronger, guess my mistakes were correct (oh!)
Ta ha
Ta ha (ta ha)!

Now if you know what you're worth, then go out and get what you're worth
But ya gotta be willing to take the hit
Not pointing fingers saying you ain't where you wanna be because of
Him, or her, or anybody!
Cowards do that and that ain't you!
You're better than that!",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-aftermath-lyrics
No Idea,Mood Muzik 4: A Turn 4 The Worst,2010,"Look, I was always told you can't make it make sense don't trust it
So I'll be out the country with the phone on fuck it
Grown from when I was dusted
But took something away out of every moment I suffered
So y'all can go on and judge it
There's a reason that I'm tellin baby girl she gotta practice patience
I plan on changing my ways I'm just procrastinating
Putting it off like I'll never be in a casket layin
With both my parents going crazy as the pastor's praying
Prideful, I don't even succumb when I'm defeated
All it do is get me mad, and I'm comfortable heated
I come from a family of drunks, I'm the one that succeeded
So nowadays I talk to God when nothing is needed
I'm sorry I don't speak the language of
Rappers in the closet, but they won't hang it up
I'm only trying to build what they attempt to destroy
We had a perfect game until it was Jim Joyce'd
Check it, what was once so majestic
Is now only adored by epileptics
I record to resurrect it, by my own accord I can't accept it
But when something gives you nightmares, can you afford to recollect it
If you can just know them odds stacked
Airplanes ain't shooting stars, you can't B.O.B. that
I found out when discussing paper
Some will sell their soul and deal with the repercussions later

With every curve they throw
Every shot that blows, I'm still here
It be the ones that's pretending to know that really have no Idea
I just let em all go ahead and speak my name
How far you gonna reach for fame
Go ahead and fuck up your career
I don't care, cause they have no idea

So sick it's livid, all pics are vivid
A stip of being gifted, gotta be equipped to live with
His critics, misquote him and miss tidbits
So he's mislabeled, misunderstood, misfit'd
Anytime I was misinformed or misguided
I went and got advice from a dude that wouldn't apply it
And he'll give out that lesson for free
Without a grudge, but I keep the past present with me
So every morning on the wake up, as she's applying make up
I'm pondering all the different ways for us to break up
Women have a tendency to get fickle
Predictable, lie and say his dick little
It be the ones you could see yourself with forever
Giving you a lecture talking about you neglect her
Couple years in, the strip club will upset her
And she'll act like you ain't have them same habits when you met her
When you can't take her
You start dropping hints for her to read between the lines
But she'll act like Fantasia
It'll be so much to be said but no one will convey it
The relationship will be over but no one will say it
A doomed fate, living with who you'd soon hate
Ex life partners trying to co-exist as roommates
Once you go through it you'll believe it
And you'll never give a woman more than you'll want her to leave with


How can the fans think us rappers are invincible
Can't find anything about that logic that's sensible
I'm thinkin they should know better off of principle
To them we're action heroes, to labels we're Expendables
My whole approach was apprehensible
Some started thinkin their 15 minutes of fame was extendable
They dont cherish the moment like they probably should
Once they star's submitted they act Hollywood
Gwapped up stacks to grip
Now you're being chauffeured in the back of whips, life style's immaculate
Out of touch with reality, I'll help you get a grasp of it
Success breeds change, but so does a lack of it
The homie's sending out subliminals
Since you a failed rapper, failed criminal, four bars is the minimal
Since you ain't from the streets I'll help and tell you the way it works
Say a nigga snitching, I'm saying show me the paper work
I don't get why the inferior bother to diss me
Heart of my city, when I go take a part of it with me
I think god will understand that was part of my misery
So instead of ""father forgive me"" it's ""father ya dig me?""
Spectated just to see if I'd get checkmated
Less progress brings less hatred which would segue way it
I learned the hard way somethings are better kept sacred
Fail at given em your all, you'll just be left naked",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-no-idea-lyrics
Sober Up,Mood Muzik 4: A Turn 4 The Worst,2010.0,"High on life (Joey)
J. Cardim, what up
Parks, what up
Dolla, what up
I think we got one with this one baby
Not really, I hate when niggas say shit like that (Joey)
Quick question though
Y'all in that mood yet?
Naw, naw they ain't hear me
(I said), y'all in that mood yet?

I broke down a while ago, finally picking up the pieces
Memoirs on how the undefeated, can feel depleted
I don't talk to God as a matter of fact I plead with
At times I hate my reflection and others I'm conceited
Half the time I'm arrogant, other times I'm vengeful
At times it's to convince me, at times it's to convince you
Done a lot of wrong but I ain't never felt resentful
It's been so many times, I lost track of who to repent to
Half the time 
I'm in the cut, don't want you to notice me
Grow with me and you'll see that I'm only awkward socially
Half the time I'm spiteful, double barrel rifle
I owe so many payback, I feel like I got a right to
So if you need a case in point, you can refer to Budden
And it'll prove the painkillers never murdered nothin
All it did was make me succumb, put ice in me, make me numb
When I revisit the places it takes me from, I'm sprung

(I ain't tryin to sober up)
Strong enough to catch contact by
You smell it as soon as you get in my ride
(I don't wanna sober up)
See with me the rules never apply
Don't tell me how I should live my life
(I ain't tryin to sober up)
Put your seat back, got it if you need that
You should really fuck with me
(I ain't tryin to sober up)
Tell me if you wanna ride or die
La la la la la la la la

Listen up as a sinner reports, my inner thoughts like an inner war
Headaches act as a tremblin force on my mental ward
Mental's distraught, every word from this sinister boss
Is brought to you by the people like your minister's Porsche
Tight ropin on dental floss, before the haters begin to get lost
Coke and weed got my temperament off
But why would my temper get lost, when as soon as the temperature frost
I'm probably havin intercourse in a resort
Criminal report, pricey condos at a minimal cost
My train of thought ain't as simple as yours
So if our paths happen to incidentally cross
I pray that you can overlook all my miniature flaws (ta ha)
Until then let's let the bass kick
Take a shot straight, I don't see a need to chase it
Tryin to fight the urge 'til there's somethin to replace it
I welcome y'all to be my co-pilots on this spaceship

(I ain't tryin to sober up)
Strong enough to catch contact by
You smell it as soon as you get in my ride
(I don't wanna sober up)
See with me the rules never apply
Don't tell me how I should live my life
(I ain't tryin to sober up)
Put your seat back, got it if you need that
You should really fuck with me

Yo, me and the gang would get so blunted
We'd order take out from the Chinese stores
Say make sure you bring change for a hundred, rob him
, 
safety on the metal's off
Figured if we beat the brakes off him
Then how the fuck was he gonna pedal off?
Some live and die by the high, I was born by it
Since Pop gave my mom the needle like go on, try it
Got me feeling like ain't a nigga could harm me
So I go and scoop a mami that wanna come join the army
She was so militant, disciplined, diligent
So I whispered to her ""bet you wouldn't mind chillin"" and
I got to know her on my sofa
I gave her my honorable discharge and she took it like a soldier
See she the type you gotta watch when she come around
Really she only get high, so she can come down
Lost her when I said she ain't gotta settle
Once you start ahead in life, you'll be on the same level, I bet you

(I ain't tryin to sober up)
Strong enough to catch contact by
You smell it as soon as you get in my ride
(I don't wanna sober up)
See with me the rules never apply
Don't tell me how I should live my life

Put me in your stainless, I'm brainless, I'm a hollow head
(My life was the craziest), surprised I'm even walkin
Can you blame me if I'm (atheist)? But I ain't Stephen Hawkins
I know God is in my (radius), I can see him often
In the face of an innocent baby but not when preacher's talkin (come on)
My people sleep in coffins, I miss 'em, I'm breakin down
In the face of a bad bitch that I'm 'posed to be takin down
(Baby ridin while I'm cryin, I'm dyin inside
Cause my pain is Poseidon or a giant Leviathan that I'm hidin from the world)
They hit me with everything but the kitchen sink
How ironic, same place I vomit when I liquor drink
Apparently I need to get a shrink
How can therapy take care of me when I don't give a fuck what niggas think?
(Pull em off from me Joey)

(I ain't tryin to sober up)
Strong enough to catch contact by
You smell it as soon as you get in my ride
(I don't wanna sober up)
See with me the rules never apply
Don't tell me how I should live my life
(I ain't tryin to sober up)
Put your seat back, got it if you need that
You should really fuck with me
(I ain't tryin to sober up)
Tell me if you wanna ride or die
La la la la la la la la",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-sober-up-lyrics
Last Day,No Love Lost,2014.0,"These niggas lied to me way back
Said this was where my buck stop
Ridin' right by in my fly shit
These niggas still at that bus stop
You'll never see these jeans sag
You would think so with this tucked Glock
And any nigga wanna go bar-for-bar
Know I’m always with that club hop
This your shit, y’all don’t know shit
Them hoes you with is just average
This four spittin’ that whole clip and my alibi is my bad bitch
So don’t be the first to get it
My life is like a movie and your bitch deserve the credit
I just stood there and directed
She just did what I expected
Doin’ me but you'd do me too
I’ll be me, my nigga, you be you
I guess that men can be groupies too
Recognize a winner – live like a born sinner
Catered dinners, finna have a pool party in the winter
Finna skinny dip bitch fuck them drawers
Her brains are killer and I love em' all
Said my head got a price on it
She come through and just suck it off
So if you scared get a weapon
Every day a nigga live like he prepared for armagedon

Now when they call me to them gates and they ask me how I live
I feel I ain’t have a choice like my stomach’s to my ribs
Niggas wanted me dead, I kept hammers in the crib
But nah, I don’t regret a fuckin’ thing I ever did
So I spend like it’s my last day
Club like it’s my last day
Ride like it’s my last day
Fry like it’s my last day
Fuck like it’s my last day
Fuck boys wanna blast me
This might be your last day
But it won’t be my last day

Yes sir
Juicy J, Joe Budden
Lets get it
Models by my side
Shooters on my team
Choppers with the beam
Countin’ up some green
Blowin’ on a blue dream
My life is like a movie and your bitch just made a scene
Me and your bitch just made a scene
Wake up and I smoke somethin’
After that, I poke somethin’
Bet she bad with a fat ass
Beat it up like she stole somethin’
Fuck two times then I roll somethin’
Can’t no nigga do it like me
All my chains is icy
All my clothes is pricy
In Louis Vuittons, no Nikes
I’m Nino Brown, you Ice-T
Snitchin’ equals dead bodies
Snitchin’ equals dead bodies
Nigga caught a death wish, think he caught me slippin’
I don’t play that bull, boy
I shoot like Scottie Pippen

Now when they call me to them gates and they ask me how I live
I feel I ain’t have a choice like my stomach’s to my ribs
Niggas wanted me dead, I kept hammers in the crib
But nah, I don’t regret a fuckin’ thing I ever did
So I spend like it’s my last day
Club like it’s my last day
Ride like it’s my last day
Fry like it’s my last day
Fuck like it’s my last day
Fuck boys wanna blast me
This might be your last day
But it won’t be my last day

I’m dressed up with my sport keys
My Rollie, bands, love short sleeves
Wanted man when I cross seas
All my bitches crossbreeds
These big faces talk Gs
I lace my H’s, walk free
I’m V-Sixin’ in V-Twelves
Ninety-three is my horse fee
Life’s a bitch I figured I’d bone
Smoke this weed while I get a little dome
Black star when it’s all said and done
Gotta put my name in the middle of the road
Open boxes, a pair a day
Mine don’t come in pearl yet
Got a party out in the UK
I’mma hit them hoes with my Euro step
Insomniac, gotta live my life
Where’s the pie? Gotta get my slice
I hommie shit, where’s the body bag?
Kiss my Maserati ass
Two thick queens in a king’s suite
Gettin’ energized off thin sleet
I let all my AKAs hit
They thought I was ten deep
Miss waitin’ on me get a hundred dollar tip
Pray to God, heard my number and I hit
Choose me, girl, make ‘em come in for the chip
When you doin’ good all the summers go quick
Trust nobody, got thunder on the hip
Shotty in the crib, don’t start no shit
Bad chick, ass and her stomach don’t fit
Know your lane, don’t come with no lip

Now when they call me to them gates and they ask me how I live
I feel I ain’t have a choice like my stomach’s to my ribs
Niggas wanted me dead, I kept hammers in the crib
But nah, I don’t regret a fuckin’ thing I ever did
So I spend like it’s my last day
Club like it’s my last day

I Wanna Know,Rage & The Machine,2016.0,"How's everybody feeling out there? We good?
Let's talk to the sample right quick, tah!
I always pictured we'd be
It go like this, listen

Let me tell you how I pictured this
A few houses, a couple businesses
Striving for greatness, we would be each other's witnesses
And during beef, we both would put aside our differences
Where I ain't flinch a bit making you insignificant
Maybe kids and shit, perfect arithmetic
Meaning we could build our own world and co-exist in it
She a synergy, sharing energy
Let our souls mate in the air if you remember me
Now here's what I did with it
Went out my way to fuck these stripper chicks
Lost good girls making them mistresses
Just savages, missed marriages
They all was my babies, I needed those miscarriages
My worthless self when Joe felt hurt
I went out and targeted women who had no self worth
I relate to praying nightly feeling no spell work
When you can do it, but a stranger gotta go help first
I called moms on the phone, here's what I told her real quick
I said my 20s flew by with no control of the shit
Her next sentence swear that I’ll forever hold with a grip
She said it go by even faster as the older you get
I wanna never dumb down, I'd have to lower my wit
Ain't gotta post this on the Gram for you to know what it is
A partner to trust, I'm thinking even bigger for us
Mom should've told me this when we had shit to discuss
Now neither one of us is how we figured we’d be
Sometimes the thought of what if still lives here with me
I always pictured we'd be

Nah'mean? That's how I see it in my head though
Ain't quite pan out like that... word up
Let me tell you about some more of God's work though

I wanna know what this life's supposed to be like
I wanna know, wanna know, ah
I wanna know what this love's supposed to be like
I wanna know, wanna know

Nah, I like it just like that, Parks, let it run
Lemme go right here, right here, right here

Look, Look
A love that's tideful, never prideful
If you're truly better without me how can I spite you?
As I yearn for the greatest love I ever had
Pardon me, kid, I'm still learning how to be a dad
We be in spots you shouldn't be in 'till you grown
I was absent so long I'm just not leaving you home
So nah, too much to learn, too much world out there
Let me teach you about these hoes, too many girls out there
I respect your mom's tutelage
But that's my weird and my brain, what's she gon' do with this?
Watch and learn, foolish kid
Eyes light up with surprise, you're just like I am
I think that you're enjoying this ride just like I am
Look, same pedigree, theoretically
Cut from a cloth that was gone, that's just genetically
One job in life to make you a much better me
Greater feeling than I imagine this shit would ever be
You be feeling strong when you diss me in songs
I did the same my whole career, would never tell you it's wrong
Whatever works out, whatever the price, get that embedded
Even if at my expense, I'll pay it, you take the credit
Had a power struggle when I thought your mom abused it
My hands were in bondage, useless
Beyond the excuses, calm through it
It’s crazy, our bond music
And we do it beautifully for our beautiful conduit
So right now I stand in a place I never stood before
Finally filled the void in my life, I wasn't good before
Fucking with these hoes, that energy I was putting forth
God, this is more like the fucking love I was looking for
Now it's better than we pictured it'd be
And the supervised visits, we'll never have to relive it
Little nigga we'll be, ha, tah!

This is greater than us, greater than me
Greater than anything I could ever imagine, man
I ain't talking to everybody? Trey, what up though? Tah!
What up? What up?

I wanna know what this life's supposed to be like
I wanna know, wanna know, ah
I wanna know what this love's supposed to be like
I wanna know, wanna know
I wanna know what this life's supposed to be like
I wanna know, wanna know, ah
I wanna know what this love's supposed to be like
I wanna know, wanna know",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-i-wanna-know-lyrics
Broken Wings,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Baby, don't understand
Why we can't just hold on to each others hands
Take these broken wings
And learn to fly again
Learn to live so free
When we hear
The voices sing
The book of love
Will open up and let us in

The voices ain't leave yet, they just getting they feet wet
Eyes red, I'm up, ain't been to sleep yet
Damn near two days, ain't even eat yet
If you don't wanna bounce, 'least take a little recess
And still I'm faced with the bullshit
Feeling like Willy D, Scarface and Bushwick
Dog, just when I gather its dead
I gotta knock on wood like Hank Gather's head
When I make small steps toward making it global
My tight knit circle turns into a oval
Filled with motherfuckas just pretending they know you
These snakes in the grass'll do whatever to coax you
Since they wanna hem you quick, I walk around like a Ginsu's tip
And that's just to get a mental grip
You don't feel what the pencil scripts
Then 8 times outta 10, you ain't been through shit
When you hear Joe you hear the conviction and diction
That open emotion, devotion is different
Real talk of when he ain't have a pot to piss in
He ain't have a car not one rock to glisten
I'm giving 'em non-fiction, conning his addictions
Ya'll got the easy job: just listen
I do it for my folk and those of another pigment
A little food for thought, you feeling malnutrition
But you don't hear a peep outta me
About the black face going on and the sheep leading sheep
It's deep, so I try to stay grounded like dad
Must be in City Island, I'm surrounded by crabs
Was once tight, grew apart for dollars
Was on the same panel, now we Star and Barbara
2 different views, 2 different lifestyles
I think along the way one of us got confused
Look, you a hustla, still attracted to the scene
Still doing shit I gave up at 16
You won't get a job, believing your own lies
You rationalize by saying you pursing your dreams
You damn near 30, nigga, you ain't got cream
Can't take care of you when you worried 'bout your team
My dude, want a hand out, wait in line
But the clock's still ticking, man, you playing with time
It's so sweet
Thought I was fucked up with no shoes 'til I met me a nigga with no feet
Tried to help niggas, some niggas I couldn't
That's my mom in me, I love niggas I shouldn't
Dudes wanna shoot 'em 'til he nailed
Some wanna threaten me, ruin my health
Let me teach you a little something 'bout depression
Ain't shit you could do to me I ain't already thought about doing to myself
I'm the voice for the youth that's living with no reason
Fuck record sales, I give 'em something to believe in
If your day starts in that broken home
Though we never met, 'least they feel like they not alone
Like I was back when I was trying to find dip
The tsunami came through my hood in '96
And tried to murder dog, I took a little dive
Then I got on my surfing board and kept sliding
Feel like A-Rod, some say his time's up
Boo a nigga at home, yup, I'm in my prime But
He by far the best player on the team
And then turn around, drop 'em to the bottom of the lineup
Should get traded, but he don't wanna move
Cause this the only city he got something to prove
And that's why I'm seen with heaters
Cause you can't be the man when you on the same team as Jeter, ya dig
It's like the game ain't getting suitable
Making me so sick I need Chicken Noodle Soup
Rappers 'Fly High', then got suicidal
Imitate Jim Jones, end up like Cory Lidle
I married hip hop, ignored what some was telling me
I started hearing rumors of infidelity
I ain't divorce 'er
All the other dudes is so whack that I ain't even feel a little jealousy",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-broken-wings-lyrics
Stuck In The Moment,Mood Muzik 4: A Turn 4 The Worst,2010," (*echo*)
How's everybody feeling out there?
Y'all good?
I wanna thank everybody for coming out
Sharing this moment with a nigga
It means more to me than it can to anybody else
Trust me (talk to 'em)

Check it, When the night falls and the smoke clears
Millions of miles away, yet they so near (uh)
I remember memories, so I'm never lead astray
When tomorrow comes I know it's only due to yesterday
Without a boundary (uh), check my latitude
New attitude, see I'm grateful for having gratitude
I'm not complacent (but), but got no regrets
Few hating niggas wanna see me regress
Deep breath, life is too short for me to be stressed
Interpret ice grilling as their way of saying he's blessed
You wanna hate, I got my own show, be my guest
Remember doctors used to tell me I was depressed
At the time was dating a model with double D chest
I thought, 'til she laughed that shit off and said these's F's
Before I bought my first gun, was already armed
Teach you about couth, little bit of class, heavy charm
Used to give my last, for a nice chain, heavy charm
High school dropout but went to every prom (talk to 'em)
Now everyone I went to high school with
Now they thirty years plus still on some high school shit (talk to 'em)
Seems like all the fly niggas and bitches that was well off (now they)
Is junk head high niggas, all the bitches fell off
From surgery, rapping for niggas that never heard of me (uh)
Burglaries, dapping up niggas that want to murder me (uh)
If you close minded, I call that an emergency
Blind fold yourself as if there's nothing more to further see (ta ha)
Honestly that's absurd to me
If the sky is the limit, then where's the urgency? (me?)
I embrace life (ta ha), I'm so carefree
But I won't judge y'all, if you don't care to be (uh)
Just know no matter who you are (what?)
The right system (it'll), turn a role player to a superstar (oh!)
I'm talking rock bottom, a whole 'nother tier
Stuck in the moment made me move through a whole 'nother year
How'd I become straight forward?
No baggage, 
y'all can run from the past, I'm a make my way towards it
Like (ta ha), nigga I remember stage fright
Back when I ain't know if I could rock the stage right
Who knew I'd end up being the nicest?
My point, hard to come up short when shit is priceless (ta ha, uh)
Hard to come up short when shit is priceless (oh!)
 - w/ Joe Budden ad libs
I can't explain it, I just gotta embrace it
That something got me feeling this way, yeah
Instead of running, I'm waiting here for it
Cause nothing ever been this great
I'm stuck in the moment
Stuck in the moment, the moment
Stuck in the moment, the moment
I'm stuck in the moment
Stuck in the moment, the moment
Stuck in the moment, the moment
I'm stuck in the moment

I say this with all certainty, people wanting the worst for me
Got to wait in a long line, it's not a first for me
Most of my defects have been put in my past
If you only see what I have, then you overlooking my path
If you knew about my hardships and the bloodshed
It'll speak for itself (trust me) and that's enough said
I carry heavy weight, who wanna try and bear it?
Hope to lessen it daily, if you wonder why I share it
Being stuck in that moment never appealed to me
You ain't live my life, so you can't imagine how real it be
I'm talking about the long haul
Put me on a high pedestal (then you), better be prepared to watch a long fall
(So) So the trampoline I adore
Got so much to say to the people I ignore
Dog, some moments you rather forget because they scare you
I lock onto them shits like a pit, they just prepare you
Photographic memory of deja-vu
The way I do, whatever I say I do
Nigga built Ford Tough, show facades what talent is (you could)
Get a different V, you ain't got to Dodge Challenges (oh!)
Emotional Roller-coaster, Vivian Green
Every event led to living a dream (or), or do I live in a dream?
Where there's no such thing as a crisis
My point, can't come up short when shit is priceless (oh!)


I've been through the struggle, been through the hustle
But never did it bring me down
I don't know where I'm going
But all I know is, I'm stuck in the moment
Maybe I've been, here before
But I don't see no need to change it
Don't know what life has in store
But I'm prepared to embrace it

Stay Schemin’ (Freestyle),UnKnown,2012.0,"Used to strive to be a G but that caper was over wit
When I wanted a M, this was all labeled appropriate
One I fronted for, one was heavy in the rear
Til I made that and realized that one was already there
Check it, They asking bout my well being, well I been fine
I just did some sets of 50 on the incline
I don't do the games, but if I happen to be into one
Burner to his melon, just my version of temple run
They tell me I'm crazy, they say that Joe's off
But I ain’t tryna grasp with new ideas using old thoughts
The whole premise of they argument is so forced
So what that say for you, if you concluded that wit no cause
That's just some lil truth for you no it alls
Nigga I can roof a bowling ball
I make a mirror change his point of view
And won't always show wit his face depends on who its pointed to
Now a bunch of groupie niggas want to join the crew
Models want to join the pool, it's funny what some coins will do
My regular sex'll be a porn to ya'll
Its wierd since I never fucked none of my friends porno stars
Wait..Forgot about that night up in the fountain blue
Decapitate that other bar, head I wasn't counted dude
When its normal for you, you ain't gotta play to win
Im more concern with how Melo's gonna play wit Lin
I took a break for a sec, I'm done chilling
Thought I lost my hunger, kind of had this numb feeling
Haters say I'm wack, paint me as this one villain
But I'll be nice longer than they gon be unwilling nigga!
Now I'm only chasing bills hard
You won't understand it 'til you face the right pill charge
Worry free cause my lawyer get it crunk
Told me i'd get time serve without ever hitting a bunk
I dont bother wit a Glock
Or haven't since I parted from the block
But if duke talking crazy then he'll do it to a cartridge full of shots
Find his body in a river down in austin won't matter if his father is a doc
Nigga!! Feet dangling from a small stretcher
Convo interrupted by a small heckler
Cause the boy feel like rapping again
You heard a Clue tape you know its about to happen again

Through My Eyes,A Loose Quarter,2012,"What if I told you grandma raised me, she was blind and all
I was trappin', little rappin', schools, 9 and all
Been to hell and back, couple ditches, all kinda falls
Fiendin' for them pills, I tried to triple that in Tylenols
Who's to question 'bout my hustle and the way I'm eatin'?
Got a family, no job, I wake up late for meetings
Early morning, all Momma dishes got the razor treatment
Gotta feed the team, God, I can't afford to pay the deacons
Man, I believe in a lot of things
But I really heard them choppers scream
Daddy a man, he ain't a vest, I went and copped the thing
Sinnin' since a gremlin, did some shit to make the doctor scream
Speakin' of my daddy, that’s another story
I'd really like to call that my mother’s story
I was rippin' and Crippin', chillin' it wasn’t for me
And I’d be lyin' if I say he ain’t do nothin' for me
Apologize if I’m talkin' 'bout me
But my fans say they wanna hear me talk about street
I could finish it by eight, I’d hit that block by nine
Perfect cubicles of work, we leave that office by three
Shit, shit, I got a whole beat to go
Long story short, we tryin' to see the dough
Ain’t mentioned my daughter yet, you should meet her, Joe
Just ‘cause you get a shot don’t mean you make this
Shit, it’s free to throw
Kinda smart, won’t say I wouldn’t have been nothin'
But it’s somethin' about the streets that make a nigga keep jumpin'
When they call, just ‘cause I leave won’t mean I make it back
My daughter three, I mean she’s smart, but try explainin' that

I see it my way
And it ain't gonna change
And you would know why
If you looked through my eyes

I mean, is sinnin' really sinnin'
When the end justify the means?
Am I wrong for wantin' for me and my team?
Southward! Cops ain’t really doin' shit
They just wearin' the uniforms and shit
Couple niggas dyin' every day
I mean, what else could you say?

So many things about this industry is misleadin'
Filled with so many feminine ways
You would think it’s a Miss leadin'
From all of my time in the streets, I never got dissed for no reason
Know I'm in Slaughterhouse now
Back then I wanted them pigs bleedin'
I’m who the kids see, but I ain’t a role model
Before I found the genie, he was hidin' in a coke bottle
And since you talk about your dad you ain’t discover
When you sign you’ll probably find
That most these rappers is your brothers
Who raised these niggas?
Higher learning, school daze these niggas
Since I can’t let a few graze these niggas
It’s one and the same, still got every cal I bought
Child support to runnin' in labels, beggin' them for now support
The shit just as foul as I thought
From steppin' out with weapons out
Loved ones in Heaven now
Persevered through Def Jam, through Lyor, through Kevin Liles
Got blackballed, bounced back, y'all
Now me and Royce be on 7 Mile
Hunger of a draft pick, even though I’m a legend now
And so I’m blind like Stevie
To the joy my son get when he see me on TV
But y'all think it's easy
I can barely walk in public, if you was in my position, Surf
Home and away games are played the same, just on different turfs
Nobody loyal, I’m a loner, I don’t have a clique
To top it off, rap money come slower than Viagra dick
Feel like all my prayers hit my loved ones with an asterisk
‘Cause rapper shit had me out the country
When my gram's was sick
No blog could ever let you know the half of it
Why the fuck niggas think I be on my passive shit?
So I can’t decide who’s the braver man
‘Cause you a slave to them streets and I’m a slave to these fans

I see it my way
And it ain't gonna change
And you would know why
If you looked through my eyes

You know what I mean?
Niggas be wantin' to switch places or trade places
Like shit is all good and all that
All niggas see is the cars and the hoes
See 'em in the strip club, lil' bit of jewelry on
And think everything gravy though
I almost punched one of these sucka niggas in the face last night

But the hood shit don’t stop
Don’t stop ‘cause you ain’t in it
They only think you take a nigga out the hood
You can’t take the hood out a nigga
Y'all don’t feel me though, young numb",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-through-my-eyes-lyrics
Poker In The Sky,Some Love Lost,2014.0,"[Intro: Joe Budden & 
Joe's Grandfather
]
Not too good, Joe. Not too good.  I tell it like it is. Nothin' I can do about it
So who's runnin' the poker games?
I don't know.  did a good job and he's retired. I don't have the game I used to have.  Uncle 
You can't, you can't give up, you can't give up poker

Just tryna explain the unexplainable
More than tryna attain the unattainable, try and make it sustainable
Collectin' all the parts, see if they interchangeable
Killin' me slow, but I'm glad it's entertainin' you
Every day it amaze me
The same thinkin' that pay me the same thinkin' that plagues me
How can I think I'm crazy? Sway me
'Cause to profit off of shit that aches me is actually pretty wavy
Uh, I'm paintin' the perfect picture
Only perfect 'cause the imperfections are highlighted
To gross currency off of that kinda sickness
Changes the meaning of mind my business
Givin' what was given to me
So the soldiers come over unsober and call me Yoda instead of Joseph
I be like ""why they come to me for advice?""
They should really come to me for a vice, I got 'em all
Got a counter full of liquor, pocket full of pills
The illusion of control, I can tell you how it feels
Accounts full of paper and the women I play wit'
All got criminal bodies, innocent faces
Come around and we have a ball, could have it all
Well, I ran out of Adderall, but that's a matter of a call, check it
Odds is they start tellin' me they hardships
Regardless, they end up wantin' hard dick, aww shit
You would think they'd been ordained
Got her legs in the air, she screamin' the Lord's name
I'm feedin' her more game, more game, more game
I started fuckin' her mind, that's when all them thoughts came
She keep sayin' if I want her I should fight for her
My plight for her, says I don't know if I'm right for her
Even so know there's a fire I ignite for her
Starin' at her ceiling, seeing me like I'm a nightcrawler
Uh, it's like she love me, but she don't (Word)
That's when she lose me, that's when she confuse me
It's what I get appalled wit', can't call it
She think I should remove her hurt since I installed it
But, I wish she knew I was perturbed too
Birds view, it hurt me more knowin' I hurt you
Even though it exists I don't ever bring it up
We don't be doin' nothin', but it's everything to us
Presently she bring up the past and it's filthy
You not talkin' to who I was or who I will be
But that's my own assignment
You wanna take all the feelings and the time spent and give it realignment
Check the catalog, lateral God
I self-sabotage, I'd explain further, but I'd rather not (Talk to 'em)
Salute, on me, everybody have a shot
I do it for the niggas they said wouldn't have a shot
But some days are better than some days
Still yet here I stand on numb legs
Women don't give a fuck that I have these scars
I'm fuckin' the same hoes that the athletes are
What a rollercoaster, we argued and we sexed (Uh)
Face in her box, James Harden in her texts
Nigga from the Clippers e'ry mornin' text her ""good mornin'""
She be sleep, he just be talkin' to me, my nigga
None of this is a pain to see
I only care about her if she pertains to me
Shit, I'm tendin' to emergencies with urgency
That urge in me is my daily fight in her purgin' me
Fuck hoes, I ain't got time to be sprung now
Grandpa's cancer just made it to his lungs now
In 2012, docs gave him few months; wild
He's alive somehow, outlived 2 sons, wow
So now their observation
Says he'll die quicker with chemo and radiation
He ain't strong enough to even go through operation
Know that death's comin', he just in the house waitin'
So you tellin' me there ain't a way to fix the shit?
Or is grandpa too old for you to give a shit?
Let's switch the shit, give you my predicament
Wonder how you would feel if I was tellin' yours live with it
And it's travelin' to his heart soon
Of course it all hit me like a harpoon
I was in shock and then it was all clearer
When he called me and asked me to be his pallbearer
I was floored
But then the next second was back to being self-centered, self-absorbed
And it became about me, fought it off long enough
I could help carry your weight, but I ain't strong enough
But why do I have to be?
This the shit I be naturally askin' me, I'm such a catastrophe
See me breakin' down with my father in back of me
So for me to attend, I'm tryna think of a strategy
But I'm happy for my dad (Why?)
He was incarcerated when his mama didn't make it
So for him to get that chance again witchu
Means the world, he could be there 'til it end for you
And me (What?), I bleed out through this pen for you
Can't carry this around, gotta vent, it's due
'Cause now, grandpa'll be closer to his wife
Have cards when I come, we playin' poker in the sky
[Outro: Joe Budden & 
Joe's Grandfather
]

You—you'll get it back
 Would you like to be a pallbearer? That's something to think about. Yeah, I'm not  Good to hear from you anyway. Take care
All right. You know I'll see you soon, Grandad
Oh, okay. Bye",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-poker-in-the-sky-lyrics
Nothing Changes,#SomeLoveSeries,2014.0,"So that's life and nothing can change it
It's up and it's down, you can't rearrange it
(Ain't that funny?)

Toast to the bitch that left me before I reached my peak
Ain't know they was offering meals, she only bought meeks
Blunt rolled, I probably faced the shit
Drive alone playin' 'Kiss
Stressing over a bitch that let Drake lyrics run a relationship
What a waste and shit
, still trying to make it hit
Industry won't listen to hood, say I'm hot as bacon bits
Went to stripper shows strapped up, parked that bull
The 24 verses with Gods and 
parks on the board
24 with options, got me feeling like I'm Yao
Right person, right place, would do this thing right now
You can take it how you wanna, if they sleeping let them slumber
Same niggas, same numbers, same Decembers turned summers
Joey said I need to chill, cool and calm, patient
Focus on the goal at hand, keep my mind vacant
Still keep that wild side, gotta time place it
So my 40 still good, I'm Sanaa Lathan
Budden like them young hoes, I'm more into cougars
38 or better, grown women, grown shooters (get it?)
I don't know what's what, let me get a few more fuck ups
Before I'm cuffed up


These critic commenters are switching fast, I did the math
I swam in the pool of sharks and now I'm just in a different class
These kids is trash, the garbage is getting bothersome
I wish I could see the past, I'm eliminating who fathered 'em
You could trace all the scars on 'em
Connect the wounds and you could say that it's martyrdom
Watch me tear out the heart of 'em, ain't nobody as hard as him
The God is him so Holyfield wouldn't spar with him
Just guard your chin
They told me I could replace a reverend
Walk through the fires of hell and get through the gates of heaven
It's Armageddon, you'll find this shit in the heart of legends
It's hard to bet him, you wonder where all these bars is headin'
Too far to get 'em, I'm saying it's just a different level
My thoughts have caused destruction, terror and twisted metal
It's just a ghetto, these bitches telling me step up
So rest up, a boy in the hood is giving their chest nuts
So guess what, the disrespectful even respect us
Fucking with women who couldn't cook, but they chef'ed up
I'm next up, these tales you couldn't relate to 'em
So when you talking it only feels like you fake to 'em
Come and talk to 'em


Look, she's asking, ""what was I supposed to do?""
Tell me who put that roof over you
Them Loubie sandals, trench coats for you
That new S Panoramic roof over you
I just need you to know the game, I can't keep coaching you
She think I wanna fuck bitches cause it's summer time
But I was on some fuck bitches, you was 
summer fine
I'm talking from experience, it's just what's on the mind
It's sounding foreign to you now, but that'll come in time
I'm a go-getter
I'm Mr. If-That-Bitch-Is-Bad-Then-Go-Get-Her
This is Wainwright up in the fourth of a no hitter
Straight from Joe scripture, bad business
I'm just giving you bars with no liquors
She tell me I'm coldhearted, ""how could you be this numb?""
Then she asks, how could she be this dumb?
But there's a transfer of energy
And your hand in its synergy
Is ruining my chance at serenity
This emotion versus logic
So let me put it this way so the arguing can stop it
Wanna know how you know if I really want to fuck that bitch?
Cause I'd go ahead and fuck that bitch
Wouldn't tweet her, wouldn't be a trace of this bitch
No pictures, wouldn't know the face of this bitch
That's real, you can't keep a grown man confined
Especially not a man of my mind, but let me handle this grind",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-nothing-changes-lyrics
She Don’t Love Me,UnKnown,UnKnown,"One
Uh, realest to ever do it
Joey
Uh, ha ha
Okay
It's, it's
Look

She don't love me
She love the power, she loves a man in my position
Loves the sex, loves a man of my positions
Love the pool, love the hot tub, my summer bunny
Both parents broke, but she come from money
And I don't just beat it up, I pound her
She reciprocates it with fresh grits and flounder
I counter by letting her put whatever on the counter
'Cause I never seen a ass better or rounder
Plus I never seen ass better around ya
No dollars, just ass, bet it surround ya
She don't love me, she love the way I navigate
Love the wordplay and how I make her masturbate
I drop her off and laugh at you while you chasing it
If I was ever in Marvin's Room, I was casing it
But dude be calling her right after I'm all in her
I be like ""Feel free, pick up, I'm watching SportsCenter""
I grew up poor, I never had shit
So now I don't hit the mall, I hit the flagship
I got her thinking that's her paper to burn
But when I lock her out, she won't doubt David is Stern
I mean, uh, they don't love me, they wanna send me Llamas
But I can understand why they envy, kinda
Friendly reminder, bank statements with plenty commas
Made it right in front of 'em, gotta thank Benihana
If you with these rap dudes, I may have tainted it
They blackballed me, I spray painted it
Been accused of cheating, but I never take the blame for it
They did all the fucking, my ass just entertained the shit
Yeah, I'm through the hood, red Porsche
They been mad, but I'm pistol whipping a dead horse
Now execs wanna hop on the phone
'Cause I snuck in the back door while they was watching the throne

I mean, uh, she don't love me, she just infatuated
She was the side chick, then she graduated
If she loved me, that would be unusual
I think she only say that shit to find out if it's mutual
]
Didn't you say you couldn't breath without me? Didn't you say that my bed without you in it is empty? I'm tryna get you to stay. I thought you said you loved me? And now my heart it broken. How could you do this to me?

Tell me
You still care for me

I'm in the zone, but I don't need MTV
I need pills, not percs, I'm on NZTs
Why the fuck would they mess with another guy's rhymes
If the stakes is high, nigga butterfly mines
I mean, hate my bars, but she love the way I say the shit
Hate my job, but she love it when I pay for shit
If she ever wild, tryna ruin my dictatorship
I put her in the oven (What that mean?),  let her bake a bit
Uh, one land, one take off
One's annoying, one demand make her take off
One’s a older nympho, get mad when I say it’s soft
But she feel a way for sports, cried when the Lakers lost
She don't love me, love the company I keep
But the fans don't love me, mean they wanna be the sheep
My motto is to do it for the culture, they not of the same gene
You want the current wave, stay on the main stream
Is it me or is what I'm hearing just pitiful?
Airwaves the same, even the stereo is typical
It don't love me, it love the models that I be with
But when I be talking about all of these models I'm poppin' at least you believe it
Wanna know the secret? I guess it's how you time the shit
You come with wooden jewelry, I give her diamond dick
I hit the booth and the track get nervous
If you say I sold out, try to track that purchase
If we shared the same life, nigga you would understand it
When no matter the charges you accrue, you never panic
You would take advantage, when I feel like you the ruler of the planet
Get some head, a little hookah on the hammock
Rodman with the trash talk, the Magic will Walt with the black ball
Way I bounce off the asphalt with cat paws
Tried to trap me 'til I started to roam
Tried to keep me out the game, so I started my own

I mean, uh, she don't love me, she just infatuated
She was the side chick, then she graduated
99 problems and a bitch is e'ry one of 'em
How the fuck I'm gonna give dick to every one of 'em?
]
If you really, really wanna go, and you say you're really gonna leave me, then I think we should have one last night together, 'cause those nights were crazy. You remember that? You used to lay me in the bed and  my body, touch me,  rub up on you, take your pants off slowly. Smells, touches, those kisses. Those licks and sucks that you love so much. You don't want that again?  crazy , throw me around, pull my hair. When you gave it to me from behind, and when I couldn't take it anymore and I had to slide down on your dick. Ooh, feels so good. I need that one more time. This  crazy. I wanna slide on it slowly.  so wet. I wanna cum like I never came before. When my hands are hanging tightly on the bed.  so, so good. Damn, you gotta give it to me one more time, I just can't stop thinking about it! I'm 'bout to cum right now! Yo, we gotta have one last night together, or you gotta fuck the shit outta me one last time.  you're never gonna forget me  shit was bad

Go ahead and judge me, I ain't gotta honor y'all
Shit, I told the judge I'll sit, never mind the bond
Nigga I won't budge in this bitch, it's like I'm a don
You can't con a con
Left from the long arm of the law
Actin' right as if my momma involved
My monologue say I'm back at it
One life, so son live it
I'm committed, never did it and wish that I undid it
Young kiddies listen, the one talkin' ain't really with it
Just forget it, would they be talkin' if they was really with it
Come visit and see that the loudest one ain't the one with it
And the one with it is the last one you want with it
Been stabbed and jumped slitted
Bad, then son ascended
And I pum-chika-chika-chika-pum-pum-ch-pum-chika
Every verse about me, worded proudly
Never worry or doubt me if you heard about me
Awake with nightmares, grew with murder around me
I'm still hitting my shmoney (shout) Shmurda and Rowdy
Ayyye, calling a bluff
I'm grown so I never think anything's more than it was like horrible bud
Never beefin' over these bitches cause it's more that I love
I ain't warring with cuz over what she's offering but
She got my hammer on rock, I'm like Thor in the club
While she semi off the Remy bitch got my dick all the way up

Now you judging me, they start some shit you got no proof of
It's not OK if I don't do as bad if I do too much
Still got nothing, what you expecting from me
Why else you checking for me
Got nowhere left here to spare, I guess that's my fault

Ayo by law
By law, by law
Guess I'm just a real nigga by law
Getcha, getcha, getcha hands high low, high low
Still gotta ride though, I know
Niggas 'round here we still live by code
Play this record if they kill me, yes the 5-0
I'ma always be a real nigga that's by law

See I'm somethin' like a phenomenon
Go ahead and judge me, I ain't gotta honor y'all

I'm committed, never did it and wish that I undid it

Look what the Lords been agin
Straight from the horses jaws of hay
With an enormous rage weighin'
Unfortunate we don't know the origin but it's important is all they sayin
This a formal statement
The airports are delaying got reporters waiting
Live from a caucus in a Secaucus basement
For Rage to leave the cage like a lawless agent
A psycho ward patient that's often pacing
Was Rage dragging a corpse like a dog with Steak-umms
For the organization's inauguration
I got shooters on call with the 4's just aching
In the four door Explorer with the awful gray tints
Notes over ya head, this a orchestration
How it is when the author give the authorization
Imploring you all to ignore the baiting
You gon' give ya opinion they gon' call it hatin'

Still gotta ride though I know

Dreamerz,Mood Muzik 4.5: The Worst Is Yet To Come,2011.0,"Check it
More questions, more answers
More ci smoke and more cancer
More arguing, more resistance
Its seems like the closer we get, its more distance
More angles, a million different looks
Was on the same page, just in different books
There's so much I want to say but I got no ground
Cause we ain't break up, more like broke down
Now that's pain and torture
Add that with restraining orders
Then add the soul of my slain daughter
None of this is how we planned it to be
One big insanity plea
Shit could never end amicably
I miss you trying, you probably think I don't try too
When you stubborn and prideful
Not much is insightful
But God was trying to show me something He ain't think that I knew
Sometimes shit that doesn't breathe can die too

Were we just dreamerz?
Waiting for our shot to shoot to the moon
Were we just dreamerz?
Spending our lives trying to see this thing through
Waiting to fly away
Waiting to fly away
Waiting to fly away
Waiting to fly away

How we go from thoughts of marriage
Thoughts of me copping karats
Talks of what we'd name her while shopping for a carriage
But when the dream stopped, who knew you'd see me like a savage
That you dreamt of vacations, but only woke up with baggage
All you ever did was love me, and look at where it got you
And when you wanted more, all I did was say I'm not you
Im selfish not selfless, and I say that with love
So in essence you're asking for what I'm incapable of
So now I find I'm going over choices I ain't even made yet
Were we clouded by good times or great sex?
Running fast towards an unknown fate
That altered when I introduced you to my unknown traits
In your dreams, seems you had me pegged as another man
But in mine, only you would understand
In our minds we were perfect
We witnessed our dream get murdered
Now reality is on trial and we both awaiting the verdict

But you'll always be close to me
Though you said this ain't how it's supposed to be
What we had was so real
But you said I don't care
Never thought this day would come
You said you gave your all and was left with none
But we can both be spared
But you don't think that's fair, thats fair


You can't see how you ever began to like a liar
You lost track of all the little things that I admired
But when the peace left, I knew we might retire
Thinking man, I live upstairs, 
I'm something like Somaya
Got memories, but at what point are they lost
You say we could work through it, at what point is it forced?
We shoulda never rushed
Cause it's like now we at a point where you won't never trust
And for me I can't believe that's all we ever was
The high's gone, need a better buzz
Cause we sleep in the same bed, but we never touch
My solution to every beef is to revisit
Though we'll have the same emotions we won't be so livid
Won't be so vivid
I think your girl secretly applauded our drama
We don't need those critics
We owe it to go over our foundation with a keen eye
Sad part to say you never have the same dream twice

We let love and all its possibility
Take us from reality
Made it hard to see that
We were bound together
Just to cover up the pain
Im wishing the skies were rain
And wipe all my thoughts away
Cause im tired of dreaming",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-dreamerz-lyrics

I swear I seen you some where before, are you sure
Are you sure we never met ?
Naw I'm not using it for some cheap pick up line
I really think you look familiar

She don't gotta a name, so for now lets call her Ashley
Had her gym clothes on, seen her when she passed me
Met her up in Exxon, body was the nicest
Cursing up a storm, she complaining 'bout the prices
She just left Toronto for Jerz, bought a condo
Know everything about her though we never had a convo
Pops wasn't around much, her mother raised her
Got so much in common that I don't like to face her
Her parents is dope heads, she dropped out of school too
Got the same tats at me and I found that unusual
Mad I smoke cigs stay they're bad for my own health
Said I'll never love me 'cause I don't love my own self
Gave me the ass the first night and I gladly tossed it
The best part was I didn't even have to ask for it
Her period don't ever come
And when I dick her down she always run

For some reason like it in front of the mirror
Let me make it clearer, she be making strange request
And I ain't talking bout just pulling on her hair
She be saying choke me like I lost all respect
And every time I do marks show up on my neck
She say punch her, smack her like I'm an attacker
I say ""you a fool"", I say ""just do what I asked ya""
I be going slow until she tell me do it faster
Every time I'm out with her these nigga just harass her
I don't understand it, she so unattractive
Shorty looking terrible plus she come with baggage
I'd tap it, though she below my average, it deceives me
She be talking marriage, saying she'll never leave me
I say I'm gonna bounce but I say I don't believe me

I be wanting to strangle her, throw her off the balcony, dangle her mangle her, how long have I carried this anger for?
How come when we argue, we gotta get physical
We crucial conflict, she ends up in critical
Habitual, happens daily, it's our ritual
But show your face bitch stop being invisible
Is it just my mental? Is she just a symbol?
There for me to look at everything that I resemble
Sometimes during sex I blurt another name
Do that mean I look at me and be ashamed
I'm cheating on me with a hottie, with a body
Who so happen to embody everything I so happen to not be
I be trying to leave her but then I get lenient
And since I'm in this room alone, she become convenient
Then we lie together, cry together
I swear I hope we die together

I finally grew the balls to tell shorty we should separate
Save your breath, nothing you can do to make me hesitate
There's no room for me and you to grow
Don't love me and leave me alone, do both
Then she apologize for anything that she did
Said without me she can't think of no reason to live
Said she'll miss getting piped down, the she picked up a shank
I had to tell the crazy bitch to put the knife down
Crying, eye shadow on her face, Filthy
""feel me, if you kill you, it's gonna kill me""
Really, she said ""you neglect me"", I said ""we the same
So whatever you do is gone affect me""
You know I can't let it be
So if we got to stay together just to coexist then so it is

Then I do it again
I stress in I got national geographics on my clothes; tune in

I keep enough of these words cos I know they be thirsty

Feeling like the game can't be weaker
It's why, homie rarely do the cameos and features
I'm good with my insanity and fevers
Cause Pac looking from heaven saying ""They ain't understand me neither""

I just let niggas get a head start
I walk to the finish, y'all spread out chase
Nah sprint out pace, and I'll still win the race (yep)
See I'm jogging
Other niggas legs starts wobbling, when opportunities start knockin
You got the crown, pass off like Stockton
It's time to work, I'm offically clocked in
He is a problem, weavin' and bobbin'
Through the speculation that his label tried to drop him
I can't leave, even though it's big options
Kev only signed me, to keep this shit rockin'
Don't ask me how I'm doin, I been better
Stuck in cold February, with a thin sweater
I'm far from a ""Yes"" man, I'm a trend setter
It's no games, just a Def Jam Vendetta
Don't put niggas in the same sink as me
I mean metaphors, story lines, deep shit, club shit, girl shit, world shit
They don't use the ink like me
Niggas don't even think like me
Who sees what I'm watching, he ain't poppin'
Don't deserve to drink water from the tub that I washed in
Wait, start again, it's a privilege to breathe the same air that I farted in
They want no parts with him
How dare niggas categorize me
If my name's on a mixtape, then capitalize me
I been stopped going to Mixtape Awards
Don't need them to tell me, the mixtapes is yours
I had other ideas, while hitting loot
I'm thinking red carpet, I went and copped a suit
See I'm thinking Grammys
Sunglasses on, with my 
On Top family
 and a bad bitch handy
He stayed at the ""W"" and felt like heaven
I'm at an actress's house, that felt like necking
R&B on, 
looked and felt like Meagan
Gave me headache till I felt like an Excedrin
Talk very fly
Least until I bought every pie, me me being war ready to my eyes
And these dudes might as well be Jamie Foxx
Trying to sound like somebody that already died
The kid keep a snub wit 'em, good pair of gloves wit 'em
Your first week ain't right, they can't fuck wit 'em
Now if you don't sell 5 mill, they had enough of 'em
Let me find out Hip Hop's turning Republican
I'll sum it up to what he is about
Still new to most, they still feeling him out
Things were type bland, Joey seasoned 'em out
I'm the nicest dude out since ""Reasonable Doubt""
Say it ain't so
Rest in Peace Luther, there's some other niggas gay on the low
 (oh)
So live, who can see 'em? No guy
I'm the Mets, was supposed to be ill in '05
As ill as the flow gets, need a pill or don't snitch
So if you can't tell, I'm preparing for '06
About to OD, anybody that know me
Can tell you I'm bout to make shit feel like it's '03
More like '99
No names should be mentioned but mine
Unless you talking 
Big Pun in his prime
Maybe 
'96 Jay, before Dame was throwing money around
Or 
2pac without Humpty around
Or 
50 before Em
, 
Nas talking like a gun in his song
Cam'ron during Children Of The Corn
Beans before the cops came through and try to grill 'em
I'm talking 
'95, Big L before they killed 'em
Em before 8 Mile
, 
Shyne before the jail shit
Canibus, no album out before the L shit
Talking bout 
Kiss
, 
DMX when he was fuckin' wit coke
Or ""
Cuban Linx
,"" Raekwon and Ghost
I do it all, who blending so well in the game
Talking Fab, back when he was still spelling his name
 (mang)
On my Diddy shit
, Memphis Grizzly shit
Like back in the day when Clue swiped all of Biggie's shit
Rappers don't need trouble with I
Unless it's 
Ras Kass before the D.W.I
Or 
Talib with Mos
, 
Common before ""Be""
If they any less common, don't put 'em before me
See, I'm not a rapper, I'm a prophet
Chill Joe stop it, skill will speak for you, don't pop shit
Fuck jail, I'm on my payroll cop shit
I call that bootleg cable, it's no box shit
All black, looking grimey in the crowd
Heat on him, no sir, don't try me when I'm out
I tote something tiny that'll blauh
Ain't gotta see Paul Wall, if you want something shiny in your mouth
I probably fool cats, cause I don't ride out in some big car
In the streets, like I ain't some big star
And these young mother fuckers is about to fuck up
Like leaving they whole career in some bitch car
No name, but it's no sublime
Nigga, you know who you are, I'll end it before it goes too far
Your buzz still fucked, you a liar money
I'm still spending ""Pump It Up"", ""Fire"" money
Glock for hire money, don't try to mug me
Call ASCAP, maybe BMI for money
Please, what's wrong wit 'em, something ain't the norm wit 'em
Ain't too many dudes out there, out-performin' 'em
Some acquire these skills, I was born wit 'em
Street's asking what's taking so long wit 'em
Jump Off, I'm the best to happen
He's the answer, the who's got the next in rapping
I suggest you ask 'em
If Hip Hop is all smoke and mirrors, then I'm the Windex and a napkin
New dudes is whack, 
some vets is has-beens
Some were Top 20, till I crept right past 'em
It's a wrap, Joey sealing it nigga
Cold out, long johns, still dealing it nigga
Still peeling it, nigga
If I only get 'em two times, just know it was the Derringer, nigga
It's that 'gnac music, don't know how to act music
Gettin' my Kanye on, putting out ""Crack Music""
Car jack music, got what they lack music
Send my little man, get rid of the pack music
That I'm back music, that click clack music
That A-Team, Muggs, that Fab
 and 
Stack
 music
Now who said they fucking with me
They just said that fucking with me, they didn't mean it",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-dumb-out-lyrics
Flex,Rage & The Machine,2016.0,"Shawty made me feel like the summertime
Feeling like the summer's mine
Yeah, she don't know the nights that a nigga went
To hang for a hundred grinds, a hundred grinds
She don't know the nights that a nigga been
Down for a hundred nights, yeah, down for a hundred grinds
I been on a mission, I been on a mission
I need you and shawty kissing, I been on a mission
It ain't too much that I listen, but I listen

Look, the text read ""At my place you wanna meet?""
Her mouth saying hello, her legs were saying peace
Her alarm in the morning when she wake up to the D
And now half of the bed wet as she lay naked on the sheets
Biting down on the pillows, swear she take it like a G
When we finish it's to the mission, gotta make it through the streets
We go our separate ways, take a break and let it breathe
Say the same about her face, with all that makeup she don't need
Listen, our conversation is best in the moment
That stimulation to me is greater than sex in the moment
Least until later when I know we'll have sex in a moment
She'll fake sleep for a second and then she'll press up on it (ayy..)
Sometimes I'll wild out and let her friends watch
Sometimes we'll pick a show and just binge watch
That's how we get to round four, we should've been stopped
Dead quiet when she flex, could hear a pin drop

Shawty made me feel like the summertime
(She made me...one)
Feeling like the summer's mine
Girl, you got something
Uh oh, I'm horny again for ya
You are the 4am flex for me (flex, flex)
You are the 4am flex for me (flex, flex)
You are the 4am flex for me (flex, flex)
You are the 4am flex for a nigga (flex, flex)
(I like that shit you be doing)
Light the weed, and like to go baby
(You know that shit you be doing) and baby
(I fucks with it)
I wanna get to know you

Yeah, I be out late tryna get it but you wait up for me
Miss dinner 'cause I'm eating, tell 'em put a plate up for me
They be coming sideways, you gon' get that straight up from me
It's always get your weight up not your hate up from me
It came to me from finessing, baby
By they time it get to you, it's just a blessing, baby
They tried to overlook me, underestimate me
Shining like a diamond, I guess I been under pressure lately
Makeup off and she still pretty
I'm on my way and I'm still litty
I like her 'cause she needs no practice
Don't wear panties, I like easy access
Know her role like she's an actress
Laid up with your boy, G's in the mattress
4am flexing on them lonely hoes
Sipping Bobby Brown, Tenderoni flows
My heart belongs to a Roni
She's my only lover, she's my only love
(One more again, it go..)
My heart belongs to a Roni
She's my only lover, she's my only love, hey...

Shawty made me feel like the summertime
(She make me...)
Feeling like the summer's mine
Girl you got something
(You know what you do to me)
Uh oh, I'm horny again for ya
You are the 4am flex for me (flex, flex)
You are the 4am flex for me (go ahead)
You are the 4am flex for me (I like it when she flex)
You are the 4am flex for a nigga (I like it when she flex)

It's obvious you got
It's obvious you got
Obvious you got (go, go, go, go)
Oh baby drinking, smoking and whistling please (uh, flex..)

Go ahead, FLEX...)

10 Mins.,Joe Budden,2003.0,"See what I'mma do is, like...
I just kinda wanna be able to, you know...
Smoke by myself
Without kinda being bothered by what a motherfucker had to say or
Without really havin' to do nothin'
So I'mma go buy this pack, of 100's
Take me about 10 minutes to smoke a whole 100
Yeah, I'mma snip one upside down
And I'mma take one out and I'mma light it...
Just give me 10 minutes
I just need 10 minutes alone
To not deal with a thing, to not answer my phone
Just to ig' my 2 way, ig' the shit in the streets
Just let me smoke this one cig in peace
Give me 10 minutes
Without y'all comin at me with that bull
Sometimes that's all it takes to ruin my last pull
And right now, that's what got the kid at peace
Let me smoke this one cig in peace
Look, now 'is a couple dudes that don't wanna see me poppin'
They sarcastically ask me 'when your CD's droppin'
Gotta keep my game face
They don't leave me no options
Can't lose my cool I know the streets keep watchin'
Dudes wanna see me lose it all
But I ain't come this far to fall
Let me talk to all of you dudes prayin that I lose it all
I ain't come this far to fall
And I ain't gotta walk around with my clip and nine
A real nigga just open his coat to me and said his is mine
He said call him with his problems
But he don't know that there's always problems, it only gets worse
Like, some dudes get threatened they can't stop me
So all they do is threaten to pop me
But go and get your weapon and cock, G
See it's real here, I dun been up and down the block all week and I'm still here
Look, you wanna know where the booze and coke at
Gangsta's, gorillas, damoo's and locs at
Where the bricks, where the dip, where the X, where the morphine be
Take the turnpike to 14B
But now it's back to this pussy dude threatenin' to hurt me
I didn't know all of this came with reppin' Jersey
But now it's no secret
If the thought of jump off doin it makes you so heated nigga so be it
But certain beef will be handeled if you're special
Only marble in the crib, is the handle on the special
My guns in the hood
I can't run from the hood
Nigga my sons in the hood
That should tell you what's what
Soon as I feel good you retards remind me
But son, it ain't hard to find me
I'm at ringside any time the fights on
And I'm in the big black truck with the Carolina lights on
Or you can hop on the Pulaski Skyway
I'm in the strip club almost every Friday
Kats is cornballs
Y'all dudes is bitches
Like I ain't got enough problems with this music business
Just give me 10 minutes
I just need 10 minutes alone
To not deal with a thing, to not answer my phone
Just to ig' my 2 way, ig' the shit in the streets
Just let me smoke this one cig in peace
Give me 10 minutes
Without y'all comin at me with that bull
Sometimes that's all it takes to ruin my last pull
And right now, that's what got the kid at peace
Let me smoke this one cig in peace
Some days I don't wanna be bothered
Some days I just miss my father (damn)
Some days I just miss my father
Some days I wanna relapse on redline
Cuz he'll be gone for 26 months fed time
I try to maintain through all this
And pray to god pop keep the same clean date in Fort Dix
My pockets 
flat
 kid
You do the math on $5.15 an hour full time after taxes
That wasn't good enough to keep my MO
Shit that wasn't good enough to complete my demo, for real
Some days I don't wanna be seen
And some days I don't shower, I don't wanna be clean
Look, sometimes the truth could hurt you
So I blow my cig smoke right at the Truth commercial
Some days I don't wanna be bothered
Some days I just miss my father
And even if by a miracle he makes it half way out
It won't be parole y'all, it be the half way house
 
but NAH
That's not the right path for a Budden
Cuz we're addicts, addicts can't do half of nothin'
Some days I'm reachin for the thing in the dresser
Some days I'm not invincible and I feel the pressure
Like if everyone's dependin on me, and I just stop
...
Then what the fuck happens?
I can't take that route and girl out
And sometimes I don't wanna hear my girls mouth cause
My hectic schedule, she ain't considering
So all I hear is the complaints and bickerin
Radio's, studio's, photo shoot's
She think I'm fuckin every girl that say I'm oh so cute, cute
Don't appreciate a man and you lose him
Worst thing to do to an innocent man is accuse him
And I ain't with beefin' with home's
Brand Nubian style, I had to love ma' but leave her alone
It ain't workin out, I'll see you aight
Just let go and let God see if we reunite
Cuz with yo shit added to the dudes that wanna see me fall
Nah, fuck it I won't fall
Let me talk to all of you dudes prayin that I lose it all
I ain't come this far to fall, fall
But listen, I'm fucked up now
Don't ask why y'all
Sometimes the best medicine is just to cry y'all
Know what I'm sayin?
Excuse my voice fans, that should be a sign that I identify with what I'm sayin
Cuz it's these type of thoughts that'll kill ya
If you smokin' with me right now, then you a good way from the filter
And I won't front like I ain't stressin'
Sometimes I need a hug, real shit, pain shared is pain lessened (nigga)
Just give me 10 minutes
I just need 10 minutes alone
To not deal with a thing, to not answer my phone
Just to ig' my 2 way, ig' the shit in the streets
Just let me smoke this one cig in peace
Give me 10 minutes
Without y'all comin at me with that bull
Sometimes that's all it takes to ruin my last pull
And right now, that's what got the kid at peace
Let me smoke this one cig in peace
Give me 10 minutes
I just need 10 minutes alone
To not deal with a thing, to not answer my phone
Just to ig' my 2 way, ig' the shit in the streets
Just let me smoke this one cig in peace
Give me 10 minutes
By myself, leave the boys at home
That's all the time I really need to enjoy my bone
If you sparked when the song was beginnin at that time
Then your stoge should be endin with mine
And to you know who...
Ma, I never saw me being with you
But sometimes y'all dreams come true
I'm like your number one fan
Damn, I ain't think Joe would see you
You's a fantasy
I wasn't supposed to meet you, NAH
Chances of that were so unlikely
And if we did meet, you wasn't supposed to like me
But look, I rap now and it just so happens
God put me in a spot where that was just so happenin, see
She had a man, I had a girl
I broke up with mine and around that same time
We was hangin out she never laid a hand on me
But I could tell from the way she glanced at me
Her looks said baby boy somethin hampers me
And it would go down but I got my man with me
Lord how can it be?
You know I never been the dude to come and break up a happy family
And these 2 looked so happy on the outside
They could've only been happy on the outside
We eventually started creepin'
But for me it's just sex
For her it's cheatin'
It went down, one time, two times, once more
Talkin real passionate, every time it jumped off
I'm in deep y'all she's more than a jump off
We both catchin' feelins, both startin to want more
But guess what, she can't leave him
Maybe it's somethin' I don't know about, maybe she needs him
Means I still gotta front like we ain't sleepin'
Still gotta shake his hand, I still gotta see him
How's he supposed to look, supposed to feel for me
He gotta know I'm feelin you, and you feelin me
How am I supposed to look at that man with respect
With Bleek singin 'Is That Your Chick In My Head'
Dru Hill - 'Somebody Sleepin In My Bed'
Aaliyah - 'If Your Girl Only Knew' reversed, but look
Here's why I'm down and out
I'm kinda worried y'all
I ain't heard from him much since he found out
Even if she wasn't mine y'all, she's still in the brain
And I know wherever she's at, she's feelin' the same
So 'till my fantasy dame pop up
Everytime the cell rings I'm prayin that her name pop up, for real
I know y'all, I ain't supposed to wife her
But it's God's fault, I wasn't supposed to like her
Sometimes I think, why'd I have to meet chick for?
And some times dog, be careful what you wish for
Some times I don't wanna be bothered
Some days I just miss my father
He's stuck in the system
Treated like a dude that's heartless
And they just transfered him, brought him up on new charges
Yeah folks I'm back to that
So I light another one and smoke back to back for real
I'm chain smokin' if you ain't on my page, listen
I'm stressed out, hopin' this one'll taste different
Dudes hopin' that I lose it all
I ain't come this far to fall
Let me talk to all of you dudes wishin that I lose it all
I ain't come this far to fall
Nah, I won't fall
Hopin that I lose it all
I won't fall, nigga (nah)
Hopin that I lose it all
I ain't come this far to fall
Nah
Nah, (ain't come this)
Some days I don't wanna be bothered
Some days I just miss my father (damn)
Just give me 10 minutes
I just need 10 minutes alone
To not deal with a thing, to not answer my phone
Just to ig' my 2 way, ig' the shit in the streets
Just let me smoke this one cig in peace
Give me 10 minutes
Without y'all comin at me with that bull
Sometimes that's all it takes to ruin my last pull
And right now, that's what got the kid at peace
Let me smoke this one cig in peace (peace, peace)",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-10-mins-lyrics
Just to Be Different,Halfway House,2008.0,"I feel like there is no need for, conversation
I wonder if the things I did were just, to be different
I would rather reveal myself than my, situation
I wonder if the things I did were just, to be different

See I don't trust no one (talk to 'em)
So stubborn 
I could dream a thousand paths, wake up and walk a old one
(Why?) And I follow wherever it take me
Instead of wherever the crew go like Tray Lee
They see distinguished
I see a nigga erasing that fine line between crazy and genius
Got the jewels out, see I'm on my Colorado shit
 (but)
I'd rather put the suit on and not follow it
 (look)
Everything is perception (I mean) everything is deception (but)
But niggas fuck with him cause I be the exception (look)
I got a warm reception way before any song hit
I think too outside of the box to be cornered
I'm too real to be fickle
Grounded but too fly
 
to meet a nigga in the middle,
 too big to be belittled
Wise way beyond my years, here's the motto of a man-child (what?)
Why try to fit in when you a standout?


Uhh, you in that mood yet? Why not?

Look, they said I had to make music that would have the kids fiending, screaming
Make nothing with a meaning, (but) I ain't know the meaning (ohh!)
They told him go Hollywood
For a split second thought I probably could (but)
But parlayed on, would I be understood?
They told me even if you not, able to cop cable
Anytime you hit the club you better have a table
Told me they would take me at my worst
Told me image is everything, so I told 'em I'd obey my thirst (whoa!)
Told me do what you gotta once you on
Hit the scene, make it rain, I told 'em I'm already in the storm
Everything's in a uproar (whoa)
They told me front, I said ""What for?"" (I mean whoa)
Said it again, I said ""Fuck y'all!""
I won't succumb to all the stereotypes
Won't sacrifice me for what the stereo hypes
They told me get in where you fit in, this is what's in demand now
So I told em why try to fit in when you a standout?


I understand something's off about me (but) but nothing's forced bout me
I never gave a fuck of what a nigga thought about me
I look down upon what some see as a must
Maybe I'm regular and the world needs to adjust
I mean I'm everyday people hood but still formal
I'm normally abnormal, taking life as a lesson
I'll leave the past in the past, tomorrow's not promised
And today's just a gift, I guess that's why it's the present
Did I outgrow me, or shit just didn't stick?
The baggier my jeans, the more shit didn't fit
(But I) Didn't quit, inspired by hate, even with homeless
When you a star you already down with the Joneses
My thoughts out loud (I mean)
Sometimes if the leader walk slow enough, he fuck around get lost in the crowd (but)
But he ain't gotta speed up, everything will pan out
(Why?) 'Cause they'll spot you from far when you a standout",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-just-to-be-different-lyrics
Three,Rage & The Machine,2016.0,"When you stay ready you ain't gotta get ready, Parks
Understand that

Microphone check, it's something new y'all rage
These views only prelude from the dude on stage
I'm old school, so my mind is in a New York state
Still feel like I'm the best rapper in the New York State
Though I'm a Jersey City product, we like two doors away
Maybe I'm just the best rapper whipping New York plates
Indeed it be the God
If Fetty is the face of New Jerz, then you see how badly we needed I
Young doing it my way, that's Frank Sinatra
I might hang with you bloggers, but I bang with the mobsters
See me right in Hell's Kitchen having drinks over pasta
Need the fake to love the real so let me thank you impostors Bicoastal early, y'all hit the Daytons and Impalas
Started buzzing around the time Sporty Thievz kept saying ""nada""
Emcees ain't even bother, and I don't know what's truly worse
Them wanting my spot or not knowing they gotta move me first

You are now entering the mind of the sick
About as remarkable as it gets
Here's what they think about you
Here's what they think about you
You are now entering the mind of the sick
About as remarkable as it gets
Here's what they think about you
Here's what they think about you


Now, Parks, let me get back to my shit right quick. Now turn me up in my headphones, let me get back on my rage shit right quick though. But turn the lights down in the booth, let's do this real quick. Look. It go

Few years, weights up, still sleep, wake up
Bitches know the stakes up since I beat my case up
Hip hop shit list, look at these bastard men dress
I'm just taking back what's owed, and adding interest
Maybe just my love died, loud lit above high
Slugs fly, eyes scrubbed dry, still a thug cries
All this paraphilia versus my necrophilia
How are they record dealing ya? I wasn't ever feeling ya
This feeling equates professional weapon, can't seal it, bruh
Deuce deuce, .380, a chopper Beretta millia
Hov said 30 is the new 20, me, I feel like 30 is the new 40
I bought 30 new 40s
A bitch moving pills get 30s to move off me
Just watch how you moving in Jersey, it's too costly
And memory with candles is where the energy laying you
Protect me from my loved ones, enemies I can handle
If you talking Slaughterhouse please refer to ""SlaughterMouse""
Think twice before you blink twice, you gotta roll with mouth
Got you birds popping, it's Korver or Kurt Warner mouse
And I be dolo, nobody gotta come warn the mouse
Used to take drives through the tunnel, we getting offers now
Smelled my man a soda, it's teddy, I bridged the water's mouth
Live from the Horror house, calling out
Done with all this drawing mouth
Duke with all the Terry Bradshaw about
Kill spree, cops should look after
Y'all be yelling free your mans, I yell at my man stop getting captured
And all my Irvington niggas over on Lyons put one in the air for Rev. Ron
You know we rock with the pastor, moment of silence

Put one in the air with me right quick. Bruh, we love you, rest in peace. All my Newark niggas what up? All my niggas over at Chancellor, what's good? Surf, I see you, on neighborhood. What up? Anywhere there's real niggas around, I'm right at home. Alright, bring my drums back in a minute. I like this bass though. I don't think that's gonna change no time soon though",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-three-lyrics
My Time,No Love Lost,2013.0,"The alternate route is a long one
But ultimately, in the end, it gets you to the same exact destination
Yes sir, the journey's been long
And the wins have been short
But today, none of that matters

The time is now, zoom, get close
The ego is gone, the room is for growth
But talent is there, the feeling is new
I mean, bottom is gone but the ceiling is too
I was higher than Whitney, headed toward the top again
Everything I write crack, like its with a Bobby pen
But it's more than what you hear in a song
The wings are extended, the fear is gone
Hold up, the clips are loaded, safety is off
The business is in the black, I ain't taking a loss
Hold up, standards are high, hoes never hold out
The touring is cool, the shows always sold out
The foes are mad, but fuck it no one else cares
The kicks are custom, you'll never see em elsewhere
The stakes are high, the risk is crucial
And they love to hate me, but I love it when they do too

I've been waiting here for so long
Gotta take what's mine
Since time will never wait
Who am I stand up fate?
It's my time, it's my time, it's my time

Look, I've been hurt, I could pull up scars
Now the earth is my pull up bar
The journey was long, the roads were slim
Though I thank God today, I probably owe it to sin
Streets were hungry, I was torn apart
Even though them jails were cold, they warmed my heart
Was living the worst, but prayed for the best
Ain't have a thing given to me, had to rape success
Had to be used for approval, had to use whatever was useful
Had to act old even when youthful
Money don't make me, that ain't what I kill for
Cause I was richer than I'd ever been, and was still poor
Some never thought he would propel
Some talked to me just to speak to themselves
Some broke their arm, all while reaching for wealth
So when you come into the game, make sure you leave with yourself
Joey

I've been waiting here for so long
Gotta take what's mine
Since time will never wait
Who am I stand up fate?
It's my time, it's my time, it's my time

We all got demons, a few I rivaled
Looked em in the eye, and they became suicidal
They thought it couldn't happen, they were too prideful
His head's an ornament on the wall as proof I survived you
Bills were high, money was low
Strip club was popping, wasn't money to go
Going nowhere fast, but drugs was a one stop
Couldn't shine selling that tan, I had my son blocked
Now I'm on acres, in a house, with a loft
The women are foreign, their blouses are off
It's a whole new me, I redefined my style
And since yesterday's gone, I guess the time is now

I've been waiting here for so long
Gotta take what's mine
Since time will never wait
Who am I stand up fate?
It's my time, it's my time, it's my time",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-my-time-lyrics
What Y’all Want,A Loose Quarter,2012,"I can see what they mad for, shit, I would be mad too
They wouldn't acknowledge me, shit, my name was taboo
Could fuck who I want now, should be my next tattoo
Passed up on your bitch, she'll settle and have you
You live in a basement, me I'm in a castle
And since I'm a drop-out, that's my cap and tassel
Closest thing to a rockstar, my friends call me Axl
To keep it a hundred I think the credit is past due
(What y'all want?)
I mean, shit's to be expected by now
When the top-tier MC's dodge, it don't annoy me
If they hearin' it like I am, it ain't a shock they avoid me
Come on! (What y'all want?)
Personally, I think you niggas is beat
He done battled a million times, he got yet to be beat
Signed to an M&M but it's these other niggas that's sweet

(What y'all want?)
Top down and adopted the crown and
I walk out, fresh kicks and all this hatred on me
And I won't give it back, so y'all gonna have to take it from me
(What y'all want?)
Shoulda got this dough by now
Or should I be that nigga, I could show you how
Been a few years, figured y'all would know by now

I see why they call him lame though, I would call him lame too
They wanted me out of here, but since then my fame grew
Used to be on house arrest, bracelet on my ankle
Couple million later and they shocked that I'm the same dude
Quick big up to Wu-Tang, deaded all that Meth stuff
Youngins go and look for beef, adults don't let it fester
Some of y'all still judge though, still believe in Esther
Y'all gonna let that ho stop y'all from hearin' what the best does?
Some of y'all don't know no better so y'all just neglect
So they'd rather compare my current girlfriend to my ex
They say I'll loose my mind if Kaylin leaves me, I digress
I think my track record should show
What y'all would think about my next
Countin' my money like it's gonna make you some
On my dick like it's gonna make you come, bum niggas
See it from my perspective, here's a little word for you
You make enough bread, it eventually goes to work for you

(What y'all want?)
Top down and adopted the crown and
I walk out, fresh kicks and all this hatred on me
And I won't give it back, so y'all gonna have to take it from me
(What y'all want?)
Shoulda got this dough by now
Or should I be that nigga, I could show you how
Been a few years, figured y'all would know by now

I see why they think I’m old though, I would think I'm old too
Reinvented mad times, I keep makin' old new
Now a nigga worldwide, back then I was local
And every dude y'all said was better than me then is old news
Modern-day present fans are fickle, it's depressin'
One single, one album, y'all gon' say he with the legends
The veterans be pissed when we pay mind to they selections
And the newbies get gassed every time they Jay Elect them
It’s niggas with more money and less respect
To me that tomfoolery's dead
Bottom line real niggas know what’s more important
And dollars ain’t in attendance when that eulogy said
So let’s get it clear first 'fore you compare 'em to me
Wait a couple years, make sure they don’t disappear first
It’ll save us some confusion, everything ain’t a classic
And everybody ain’t dope, some of that is an illusion
The funny thing about a label push
You never know, shit could go either way
Go ahead and run along side it, end up on the wrong side of it
When your life change it could be only weeks away
I'm a result of the fans and deadin' the middle man
With that logic I don’t got to rely on a good day
Did great on a label, did greater on my own
So pick the MC of the moment and ponder: could they?

(What y'all want?)
Top down and adopted the crown and
I walk out, fresh kicks and all this hatred on me
And I won't give it back, so y'all gonna have to take it from me
(What y'all want?)
Shoulda got this dough by now
Or should I be that nigga, I could show you how
Been a few years, figured y'all would know by now",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-what-yall-want-lyrics
Top Of The World,No Love Lost,2013.0,"You can catch me in a strip club, stacked up, I don't keep 'em visible
Won't see a man get thirsty cause I'm known to keep a bitch or two
Probably both be bisexual, I tell them chill and kick it boo
And never get uncomfortable these waitresses start kissing you
Y'all would call it birthday sex, I call it a ritual
If you seen it like me then I already know why y'all be miserable
You don't really want no problems, cause those shooters they're hospitable
And they gon grab them blockas while you try and keep it physical
Pool house or that guest house it don't matter where it goes down
Driveway is cobblestone, garage is like a ghost town
I ain't even touch 'em yet they feel like they've been hosed down
If you real then you gotta respect this shit, Gs up, hoes down

I'm chilling on top of the world (top of the world, top of the world)
Now you know all about me girl (about me girl, about me girl)
Tell them niggas I did it, look how I came up
Tell em niggas I'm with it, if they bring my name up
Tell em bitches I'm gone
Don't be callin' my phone (phone) if it ain't 'bout the money baby (baby...)

Hold up, let’s get back to my loved ones, those of y'all that been with me
Helped me to exorcise my demons, brought them to the gym with me
Probably why she text me to death like, ""Joe, I got a friend wit me
And I'd love to eat her out while you on top, putting a limb in me""
Let's get back to them things I like, let's get back to that stripper pole
Let's get back to her popping that, I ain’t even really gotta tip her though
It's bonjour while I'm on tour, I mean every night, different show
And if you a little bit too sober, just tell me your favorite liquor, ho
Wait, tell me your favorite, then lick a ho
We them dudes you wanna get to know, cameras up no pictures though
Looking for them broke niggas -- don't aim at me, there ain't none
To respect my position, gotta respect where a nigga came from


She know I like it when her hair curled, sun dress, little bit of make up on
Turnpike, Parkway, either way won't take us long
Hit the club, 20 minutes, deuces either way I'm gone
Be a fool if I stayed there wit an ass bouncing in my favorite thong
I came from nothing like my father was a deadbeat
Wasn't for that, I don't know if I'd say success is sweet
Top of the world let's let how I sustain maintain my legacy
Taking a bit of my soul but won't let it consume the rest of me
Now let's get back to this paper though, every day, same shit
Screaming RNS for life, some of y'all don't know that language
Living for you, never for them, best way to explain it is
I want the most because I had the least, that's why I'm on my game, biotch",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-top-of-the-world-lyrics
Are You in That Mood Yet?,Mood Muzik 2: Can It Get Any Worse?,2005.0,"Yo, I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knockin' at my front door
I'm livin everyday like a hustle, another drug to juggle
Another day another struggle, yo
I know it's fucked up what a lack of cake'll do
A few people wanna move in and stay wit you
You wish you could help 'em all, but you ain't able to
Cause the rent's a lil' late plus the cable's due
You and your girlfriend are beefin' in a serious way
You used to be faithful (NOW) you at a curious stage (for real)
Finally got your mind made on going your separate ways WAIT
Nah homeboy, her period's late now THINK
Your time's runnin out do it quickly (WHY?!)
Cause she starts crying, mood's gettin sticky
If I don't want it she'll want nuttin to do wit me
JUST GET THE ABORTION AND I'LL GIVE YOU THE 250!
But if you say that to her then you wrong
You ain't think 'bout that, you was gettin your groove on
Can't take care of myself nevermind a new born
I guess the pussy got too good for too long
Seems like my money goes by too easy
Why I hate that my job only pays bi-weekly
Hoopty done shitted, you spendin more money tryin to fix it
Than when you did tryin to get it (C'MON!)
Fridge is empty, but I survive the hunger
Who the fuck keeps callin from this private number?
There's crime on my mind and my nails are dirty
The floors are real cold in the jails of Jersey
Depression starts talkin and his voice is raspy
CAUSE HE AIN'T SHUT THE FUCK UP IN 3 AND A HALF WEEKS!
Look, beard is full, hair is nappy
These jeans ain't mine so they way too baggy
Priorities is fucked shit startin to gas me
It's like my lil' man's life slipped right past me (talk to em)
Startin to trap me, his name's Dwayne SO WHY THE FUCK MY SON KEEP CALLIN' HIM DADDY?!
Same shit that I feared after all these years
I gotta breathe I can't believe my ears
Wipin out my eyes I'm damn near in tears
But you can't be mad, you know you ain't been there (nah)
Grab his moms I throw her against the door
But in the back of your mind you know it ain't her fault (nah)
I ain't mad at all, I'm just bothered
I get honest for real I ain't been the best father like
Toys 'R Us, Chuck E Cheese
You know a lil' boy grow up wit these needs
New Year's or Christmas, even the birthday
At least bring the nigga to his school on the first day (OHHHH)
I can't believe it, this the same way that I was treated
So maybe it's history repeated
I know it sounds sick the idea of havin another kid
But this one it really feel like it's his (OHHHH)
It's the truth and I hate that fact
WAIT, shouldn't have said that I take that back
Look, I apologize let's rewind this whole story like NaS
C4 just erase that track (C'MON!)
I don't care if only the track trust me
FUCK! what niggas say only God can judge me
FUCK! what niggas heard or think or even thought
Tried to fix my shortcomings I just came up short

Man Down,All Love Lost,2015.0,"Joey
Mic check, mic check
It go

Okay the wait's up, waited up, really don't know where to start
Niggas fresh home want me dead and gone, I'm darin' y'all
It's in arms reach when I'm sleep, I'm prepared for y'all
Niggas bleed, BIG agrees, ain't nobody scared of y'all
Besides, let me summarize, they ain't got to wherewithal
I'm every where, they never there, when I'm gon' hear from y'all?
Y'all know me as Joe, don't wanna see me as Mouse
Let me address all these rumors so they don't leave out the house
I mean it started with Clue, that's when the bullshit begun
I was the best in my city, niggas knew I was the one
Ain't have a dime to my name, still niggas thought that I won
And niggas that never did it want to tell me how it was done
I'm hearin' some wanna clap, they don't fuck with me, nigga
They say I never go back, well that's a luxury, nigga
It's somethin' I can afford, so what they say get ignored
They pray I'm on the wrong end of that Ford

They want me man down
They want me man down

Okay let's start it from scratch, put it all on line
My character's been defamed, I put it all online
Told 'em that's where we were headed, said I was wrong all the time
And now we finally here, I waited a long ass time
Been called every name in the book, been a liar, a deceiver
A cheater, a woman beater, am I all, am I neither?
Been absorbin' the ether, robbin' Paul to pay Peter
High price to pay to strangers I been offering me to
I've been more than a leader, even with my back to the wall
Thought I was finished forever when I was practicin' falls
Now you second guessin' yourself, you gotta ask what you saw
They fishin', wishin' it's fiction, but ain't no actin' at all
Can't even fathom the gall, they mad I'm appalled
Too much passion to call, nothin' but bars, ain't no fashion involved
How is path ain't adored
How the fuck they laughin', I can blast through the door
Ain't fathom havin' so much cash in the drawer
First they love me and then they hate me, then they love me again
First it's lovely and then it's ugly, then it's fuck me again
Bitches don't text back and then they suck me again
But still it's none of my business what they think of me again
When we talk about skill, they just love again
I call 'em out for the kill, they just doubt me again
But I was born for the storm, I mean abnormal's the norm
Maybe they wanna know how long will they mourn

They want me man down
They want me man down

I'm wishin' this was a dream, maybe it's smoke in this mirror
Wish I could change it all just by blowin' smoke in the mirror
Been such a long ride, wishin' I was on the side
To get caffeine pills to stay awake with Sean Price
If I was by Eric Garner, I'd have yelled at the pigs
Gave him all my cash, he wouldn't have to sell that cig
Shout to Bobbi Kristina, let her know that I love her
Wish she was alive or didn't die the same as her mother
Maybe my thinkin' is off, when I blink I get thoughts
Of bullets shakin' the door, and tape around Chinx' Porsche
See it damaged my heart, I'd be right in Yams' car
To get the purp out his cup, and get his hands off the bar
Tell Stack that I miss him, see we losin' a lot
I wanna hear from Shakir, I still miss Stuart Scott
Chris Lighty, Robin Williams still to this day
I pray nobody ever feel that way, too many men die

They want me man down",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-man-down-lyrics
Follow My Lead,Mood Muzik 4: A Turn 4 The Worst,2010,"Uh, I got bitches on my dick, I don't want 'em near
Closet full of brand names, I don't wanna wear
Everybody got advice that I don't wanna hear
World in your palm but you don't wanna share
Still I'm followin you - are you leadin me with a weapon drawn?
Co-dependent on her but got me in bed alone
You say if you love it let it go, nothin set in stone
Plus every rock they throw, I use as a stepping stone
Got questions, say the answer's better left unknown
Though I may not never see you, I should know you never gone
So I break the mirror, cause everything it's showin me is wrong
Grab your hand and go along - cause I'm followin you
I say I should be pleased, what if I'm saddened?
Always say I've been through worse, what if I haven't?
But if that holds true, here's the lesson
If you keep your head down, you might miss out on the blessing, sing
 - w/ ad libs
I don't need the money (money), I don't need the fame (fame)
I don't need the lifestyle, I don't need the pain (pain)
I don't need the clubs (uh), I don't need the cars
None of that really matters to me (whoa)
I don't want the bad bitch, I don't want the strain (nope)
I don't want the highs, enough shit on the brain
I don't want whatever's gonna help me be sane
I just wanna follow your lead

You sayin follow my lead, follow, follow my lead
Brought me to my knees, he must wanna holla at me
When the world feel like swallowin me
When every decision costly and I ain't got a dollar on me
Check it, I don't wanna pretend, I don't wanna live a lie
I don't wanna be judged, don't wanna be criticized
I don't wanna talk, there's nothin I wanna say
The more I let 'em get to know me, the more they just run away
And that, must be your way of sayin we should stay together
I know how to fuck it up more than I can make it better
I figured folk around me would learn to take it better
Instead of tryin change me, I've been this way forever
Time will reveal more will be shown
You pushed it, I thought the door closed on it's own
But uh, nevermind what caused it
Livin a dream, nothin in this world powerful enough to pause it, sing
 - w/ ad libs

He's sayin follow my lead, follow, follow my lead (uh)
Cig in my mouth, prescription bottle by me
And even when I think you might be makin a mistake
I may not know the destination but I make it there safe
Check it, when I feel like I can't get weaker, uh
You always come and make a cameo or feature
I'm good with my insanity and fevers
Cause Pac's lookin from heaven sayin ""they ain't understand me neither""
A lot of times you leave me exposed
And laugh at me, still thinkin I could be in control
Help me weather the storm, altogether I ain't know him
Cause I always disagree, though you ain't never been wrong
Listen, I was feelin nearly unstoppable
And now I'm facin what appeared to be impossible
Feelin unimportant enough to have to bother you
But I'm down here alone nigga, all I got is you
 - w/ ad libs

Uh, follow my leeeead
Follow my lead

Check it (yaowa), I can't fit it all in a sixteen
The night that I was tipsy and all them bullets just missed me (oh!)
The day they rushed the block, I was strapped but they didn't frisk me
(Damn) Why I ain't fuck that stripper? Don't ask and now she's sick B
The drop on that jewelry store for fifty
And I backed out last minute like ""nah, this shit look risky""
One of my mans dead, the other one in Poughkeepsie (man)
Another one in the Feds, he'll be there until he's sixty (no!)
I want to thank you for the blessings and the gifts
And the lessons and the messages they left, I get the drift (I know)
Fuck the cheddar or whatever, it don't measure up to this (naw)
I mean never did I ever not remember you exist (woo!)
When I hop up out my bed, hands together and I wish
Swear to you it's from the heart, inside my chest you let it tick (thank you)
I love you from the soul with every spiritual molecule (word)
Fuck Twitter, all a nigga gotta do is follow you

Uncle Joe,Rage & The Machine,2016.0,"It's Uncle Joe in here
It's Uncle Joe, it's Uncle Joe, it's Uncle Joe in here
It's Uncle Joe, it's Uncle Joe, it's Uncle Joe in here
It's Uncle Joe, it's Uncle Joe, it's Uncle Joe in here

It's Uncle Joe, peep while the story is told
Look like I'm the last nigga to know I got old
Which is fine, as Uncle Joe I wear that age like it's a three piece suit
Can't get to this type of flavor without the seasoning, true
Every Sunday at the spades table slamming cards, hella hard
Spitting old Ruff Ryder or Roc-A-Fella bars
I'm telling stories of Khaled before he Terror Squad
Different from what they selling y'all, fuck am I telling y'all?
It's Uncle Joe, don't wear Supreme and jeans
Came up with Nitty and Webb, 
I knew Supreme in Queens
And Ross dropped ""B.M.F."" and y'all would sing in the streets
I'm a little different, I was thinking of Meech
, check this shit
I used to drive around the tunnel in the Lexus with the snub
Before Power 105 was sneaking breakfast in the club
Listen, young niggas learn up, I don't do the kiddie shit
I'm with the turn up, I just like Biggie shit
Fuck is you saying? Only been a sensation for only two generations
I'm like the minute the weigh in fight ready
Friends are forever changing
And all them niggas I came up in the game with done fainted in the entertainment I swear

They say the older you get in life the faster it happens. Me, I feel like I could still fuck with 25 year olds and their mom if they cute enough
So when I walk up in the day party and said, ""what up?"" all I hear is ""Uncle Joe"" in this bitch

Same way you know when you up, you better know when you slip
Studies based of years hanging with the boa constricts
I'm from an era where we ain't deal with all the trolling and shit
When we see you we just go in your shit
There's repercussions for actions, we demanded more, don't understand it, dawg
Question all these niggas with words they never answer for
Staring at you new niggas still from an older state
It's feeling like Oscar Robertson watching Golden State
Y'all hear Post Malone and think of ""White Iverson""
I think of Karl and how he could've got the title won
I keep my life off Instagram, I like my private some
I open albums for the credits, y'all just TIDAL 'em
It's Uncle Joe, it's Uncle Joe, it's Uncle Joe in here
It's Uncle Joe, it's Uncle Joe in this bitch
When there was problems with the game, I got to scoping that bitch
But they just kept talking about my hoes, I don't even notice the shit
I got a stash I never go in and shit, same emotionless kids
Stoic as if I'm just a motionless GIF
Normally in the club tucked in the corner, no one to mind me
You niggas go and look for these bitches, they come and find me
Y'all praise it, I be disgusted
'Cause I don't want the points for scoring on easy buckets (and what else?)
And I don't count her if she ain't alter my weekly budget
Or if she Snapchat every portion that we in public
That's awful, she need to cut it (she need to cut it)
Bria's in the W with Sandra
The escorts fuck with me, that's a double entendre
Both got fat asses, one's a double cup monster
Both used to mad attention, it's my subtlety they fond of

It's Uncle Joe, it's Uncle Joe in this bitch

Freedom,UnKnown,2016.0,"I can't really do shit cause they got me handcuffed
It's okay mommy
I can't believe they just did this, I'm fuckin'...
It's okay, I'm right here with you!

Now, what we've been doing is looking at the data and we know that police somehow manage to deescalate, disarm and not kill white people everyday. So what's going to happen is we are going to have equal rights and justice in our own country or we will restructure their function and ours

Let's take a moment to stand and observe the Hell we live in
No matter how high the fire it never melts the system
Some can help but didn't, we fill up the jails and prisons
You don't believe that's a business, only yourself you're kiddin'
But now they killin' our people, it's all on television
Them cops went home to their people, turn on the television
I tell my son, careful what you learn on television
He 15, he don't know what I mean
Don't know about yet, doubt and suspect, out sets of controlled outlets
From those who don't wanna let us out yet
Land of the free, the home of the brave (nah)
Can't let us be, we've grown from slaves
It's there if you wanna read, I mean it's all on the page
Say it's police, I just know when it's race
Now it's just thrown in our face....
Maybe I'm lost, signs are vital to me
Sandra Bland didn't come off as suicidal to me
Y'all play around, thinkin' we on safe ground
They killed Tamir Rice and his rights, right on that playground
Eric was selling cigarettes, ""I can't breathe,"" it was said
The bigger threat he was a nigga, I bet, but listen
Last year I went to church with my Mother Fay
We sat behind Ms. Garner, and it was Mother's Day
She sat strong, inside I cried for her
My eyes tucking the water as I was hugging his daughter...
Philando Castillo told him he had a weapons permit
Was murdered moments after without a complexion permit
That's bloodshed with his daughter in the car
I'm only upset for our sons and daughters tomorrow
Question, how many cities we gotta march through?
Signs we gotta hold up, or are they tryna provoke us?
Cause when them 9s load up, and land mines blow up
And the crime don't slow up, they'll chime in and say they told us
Or is it only a crime when done by poor us
Food for thought, my mind don't run off of cold cuts
Raw and evident, Alton was offed, heaven sent
Recorded the negligence, they just ignore the evidence
And make it seem as if we in y'all way
Maybe our government is governed by the NRA
That would make a diseased Capitol, in need of capital
They even legalized weed for the Capitol
But be black, sell in the street, they get mad at you
Casually clap at you, it's Uncle Sam sayin' taxes due
Our epidemic systemic
Black Panther fist at Olympics they just condemn it, hold up
Said the Klan marched in Piedmont
Even worse, they were protected by police arms
In Baton Rouge its pictures of them in riot gear
It tells me they know it's plenty reason to riot there
Yet we just keep on praying all while we feeling it
Racism still alive, now they not concealing it
It's revamped, shackles are gone, now we get house slippers
And all us millionaires are the house niggers
Irony, the only ones naked are urban outfitters
White people seeing us murdered are even down with us
They sayin' let's make America great again
I'm curious, what time would you like to place us in?
Were we degraded then? Did they enslave us then?
Or is it ignorant of me to even say again?
If it's civil war, then what are we civil for?
It's this is freedom to y'all, you better get us some more

Freedom! Freedom! I can't move
Freedom, cut me loose!
Freedom! Freedom! Where are you?
Cause I need freedom too!
I break chains all by myself
Won't let my freedom rot in hell
Hey! I'ma keep running
Cause a winner don't quit on themselves

And we're done watching and waiting while this invention called whiteness uses and abuses us, burying black people out of sight and out of mind while extracting our culture, our dollars, our entertainment like oil - black gold, ghettoizing and demeaning our creations then stealing them, gentrifying our genius and then trying us on like costumes before discarding our bodies like rinds of strange fruit",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-freedom-lyrics
1000 Faces,Mood Muzik 4: A Turn 4 The Worst,2010,"Now we were once two niggas of the same kind
Went to holla at a hoochie with the same line
Sorta, honestly Ill never guessed you were a hoarder
And all that would manifest cause of what we both thought of her
So I’m like “how could you get mad of what she thought of me”
I found out seasons don’t only change quarterly
Cause you got bitter, it was real fickle
With me saying “girls are a dime a dozen” to a nigga with a nickel
I guess nobody told him that gossip and slander is not the answer
Wish I’da known that she woulda flipped out of propaganda
Ice in my veins, some people are less skilled
And he brought me up on charges when his ego got killed
When my friends in doubt, they learned a valuable lesson bout
In 30 years I ain’t reckon how to reconcile
What hurts more? The act of getting cut off
Or realizing that your 2 cents wasn’t worth more

(So, you know it's hell, you know it well)
Now I'm forced to look behind
I'm forced to look at you
You wear a thousand faces
Tell me, tell which is you
(So, you know it's hell, you know it well)
Broken mirrors paint the floor
Why can't you see the truth
You wear a thousand faces
Tell me, tell me which is you

Nothing could help somebody switch up more then thirst can
I seen the ill effect that fame can have first hand
Am I to blame for the person that you became?
Were you’re already on that path? Its so hard for me to explain
Look, some indicate that im watching who I never met
I see some things happening now that you would never let
If you were in your right mind
Were you showing me the right person at the right time
Or were you trying to make it easy?
Did it really please you to please me
Did that make you change everything about you to appease me?
My prides in shambles, wondering why and when did you decide to gamble
Or are you competing with Mya Campbell
When did that become suitable
How could you make something so ugly out of what was once beautiful
Next time beauty’s headed towards me I plan to dodge
Until I see its not just being used as a camouflage


Only reason I continue to antagonize
Just my way of bringing truth into a pack of lies
Reveals peoples true colors, removes a bad disguise
Even though its something I predicted I just act surprised
That way the armor never chinks on me
Drunk mouth, sober tongue homie drinks on me
That way I’m protected, y’all got no choice but to respect it
Seen too many come and go to be affected
And how is it not expected
I’m hip to what its bound to be
And them relationships, combined ain’t weigh a pound to me
And so the bullshit, make sure its tasteful when its done
You can keep your 1000 faces, but try being faithful to one",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-1000-faces-lyrics
Walk With Me,Joe Budden,2003.0,"Come and take a walk with me...
I need all of y'all to come and take a walk with me...
I need for all of y'all to feel what I'm going through
And see what I see, if you got time to take a walk with me
Wait a minute now...
Shit ain't like I thought it would be
Come to Jersey from New York with me
I know you busy...
But take the time out to walk with me
Pay attention on this tour with me
Maybe I'm seeing something wrong
Come along and make sure with me
Come and take a short walk with me

Yo...I'm seeing a couple things wrong with the way that I'm living
So come and walk with me I just need a second opinion
Introduce you to my friends I got to see if you notice
If they loyal or if they all got an ulterior motive
See some snake niggas, me and them don't deal anymore
Ever since I got signed I don't know what's real anymore
I'm paranoid so excuse me if I seem to be nervous
But everybody from my past now they trying to resurface
Trying to rekindle, They don't think I know they gone limo
I got cousins I never knew they trying to pass me a demo
Maybe I'm wrong, like I told you main I need your opinion
Me and him never spoke before so I don't see whats so different
Dudes I don't know they recognize me start extending they hand
And I'm trippin ready for beef when he was only a fan (why?)
Cause these niggas in my hood say they don't like how I'm reppin'
Let me know how strongly you feel, will I be needing my weapon
As some sort of protection, should I carry a pen and pad
And ask everybody in the fucking hood for they suggestion
I'm letting the labels know that Jersey City is gifted (dog)
When they didn't know that Jersey City existed, but it's cool dog
Certain cats in Jersey City so hateful (Hatefulll)
And certain cats in Jersey City ain't grateful (Ain't gratefulllll)
All they say is I don't chill anymore
And ever since I got signed they don't think I'm real anymore
I'm told I shouldn't be alone cause I'm a star in my hood
Something might happen Mouse, they know who you are in the hood, they do
So I can't tell you how I feel anymore
Ever since I got signed I can't tell what's real anymore, you feelin' me dog


See to me it's heavy, but to you it may seem petty
Let's continue walking, I know you ain't tired already
I take you to meet my girl I got to see if you notice
If she love me or if the bitch got an ulterior motive
Why am I hated? Cause I handle my business
Ain't gotta look for a girl nowadays cause almost all these niggas is bitches
See 'em often while we walking, I'll show you the drug dealers
And some dudes that hate me word on the streets is they real killers dog
Where was the hate back when I wasn't on my feet
An alcoholic, school dropout, just a bum on the street
Where was the hate during my adolescence?
Back when that psychiatrist was trying hard to get me on them antidepressants
So man I don't recall none of this happenin' back then
And I don't understand I was still rappin' back then
So I got to ride with a gun
From trying to get my mom and pop up out of the slums and provide for my son
If you met my baby moms would you notice
If she was ready for a child of if her ass had an ulterior motive
I don't know what she's teaching Trey but everday he get older
Angie's bitter and feel like now that I'm successful I owe her
Cause she would hold me so tight when I was ready to relapse
Tell me to relax, I ain't know no better straight out of rehab
Bottom line I was lonesome
But we was wrong for each other, Angie I grown some
Got bigger issues, if you went to Def Jam would you notice
If they was out for my best interest or do they just see a dollar in Joseph?
(Ugh) Guess I ain't sure how I feel anymore
Ever since I got signed I can't tell what's real anymore
I mean them same record execs that wanted me in
Don't care that I'm the next nigga, they just wanna see spins I swear
Guess I ain't sure how I feel anymore
Ever since I got signed I can't tell what's real anymore, you feelin' me dog",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-walk-with-me-lyrics
Make A Deal,#SomeLoveSeries,2014.0,"Who knew that Lucifer was cutting side deals
I know he's coming for me so I keep my eyes pealed
Although my situation is never really ideal
If I don't find a better way then maybe God will
And he don't got no trophies for the runner up
The escalator's going down, but I'm running up
They told me I was goin' be nothing but a lost cause
Nigga you been down a couple years so how you coming up?
How you stop a nigga from leaving after the love is lost?
How you stop a nigga from bleeding after the blood is lost?
Yeah, I got a couple of demons, don't get no one involved
Yeah, I got some goals I'm achieving nigga I want it all!
The money's piling, I'm diving in it, I somersault
My stomach's crying, I gotta get it, I'm coming for it (damn)
Let's swap shoes, you can know how I feel
Guess I'm just a little confused, I don't know if it's real
Is it real?

If I only could, make a deal with God
Get him to swap our places
I'd be running up that road
I'd be running up that hill
I'd be running up that building
If I only could

I'd ask God how I last in this
Nah I'd rather kick it with him 'cause to ask him shit, I would deem as blasphemous
Pick his brain and try to see what his passion is
Knowing me, I'd debate whatever his ration is
Product of a hell, but I'm knowledgeable myself
I'd trade me for the business that is hospitals and jails
'Cause there's profits involved when they nail a convict
You create these diseases then sell us the fix
Or was it just to hinder me?
Every inch of me would make or break, or make great sense to me but then he try to censor me
But he can have that, that ain't even what I'm mad at
I would give him a stack back if he would give me Stack back
Let's trade shoes I tell 'em mine are hot
If I made in his likeness would he really mind a swap?
And if he did wonder if I would feel
Like I put faith in some shit that ain't real, it gives me chill

If I only could, make a deal with God
Get him to swap our places
I'd be running up that road
I'd be running up that hill
I'd be running up that building
If I only could

How could you make a deal without the devil in it?
Some people make mistakes then say the devil did it
Life is like a game 'cause there's different levels in it
You won't read the board if you're in court and you don't get acquitted
They say it's all metaphysics, why you lying if you ain't never did it?
If I don't walk through the fire then who the fuck will?
I think I'm on the right path it's all uphill

Or could it be the right path wrong time?
Right thought, wrong mind? Short success, long grind
They say even when he's late that he's always on time
Wishing we could switch places so he sees what's on mine
'Cause it's heavier lately, the water's coming down, but the levee won't break me
And this world as is I think you better sedate me
I'm just having sick thoughts 'cause you ain't met with me lately

If I only could, make a deal with God
Get him to swap our places
I'd be running up that road
I'd be running up that hill
I'd be running up that building
If I only could

I'd be running up that road (uuuuuh)
If I only could
I wanna thank you...for everything
Only by His grace and mercy
I appreciate it...help me",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-make-a-deal-lyrics
6 Minutes of Death,Mood Muzik 2: Can It Get Any Worse?,2005.0,"Millz break the block down from A to Z
I could supply you with work, little nigga, I'm like a temp agency
I'm in the kitchen, wood chair with the feet broke
Soft white got the table looking like a ski slope
Fuck going out, me and my money elope
And most niggas rap about money but they be broke
My man went to Morehouse and had strong blow
So I had him pitching in Atlanta like John Smoltz
Nigga, money make the world go round
And a stack of it'll make a nigga girl go down, clown
Patron and Grey Goose get the bitch loose
And after the crew, I'll have her licking on her sis, too
We getting money where I'm from, nigga (Harlem!)
We getting tired of your chick, tell her pack her shit
Come and get her, put her onto some shit, and get her grind right
Get her mind right, fatten the ass and get her spine tight
I'm the flyest
Most niggas want a deal with Nike
I'm like, dumb nigga, I'm tryna buy it
I need percentages, I don't care who the hottest
Little nigga, I think big like Christopher Wallace
And I won't stop until my grandkids' grandkids sitting on dollars
And I ain't even a father, nigga, call me Your Majesty
Young, black and fly
And when it come to dough I got a Jewish mentality
Little fuck niggas still trying to battle me
I go in their mouth like I'm a dentist looking for cavities
I don't know why your mans hyped you with that battery
I'll hit your whole team with caps, and I don't mean salaries, nigga
Already got dough, now I'm chasing the power
I'm the statue, stand tall cause I'm replacing the Towers
And these niggas washed up now, they faces is sour
Mad cause they broke and lonely and I'm making them dollars
With enough divas to spread out to ten cities
I can throw assists all night like I'm M. Bibby
Harlem got a fucking reason to front now
Uptown, let's go, we got a reason to stunt now
I told Joey and Stack shit ain't intact
Captains lost our city now we gotta get it back
Nigga, you can take it how you wanna
But ain't nothing impress me for the last three summers
I don't give a fuck how disrespected you may feel
Nigga, see me when you see me
It's whatever, it's Jae Millz, motherfucker

Nigga, the booth feel better when real 'round it
Still round it, dress square but a nigga well rounded
Grounded like I came home late on my curfew
And proved I was better than most niggas my first two
Lil' years in the mixtape league
Now it's bidding war time, I got a Bloomberg league
So the hood's overwhelmed
They know it's the voice of the hustle
Whenever they hear son up at the helm
Son give 'em hell like Daniel in The Advocate
The fans fiending for it, they got the addict itch
That's the bundles, put it all in your nose
These niggas is lil' me's, hear it all in their flows
Ho's, that's a topic you don't even wanna touch on
I face-fuck the ones you couldn't touch on
Hand brushed on see the denim, know what these 'bout
The Antik's, Red Monkey's, or Vi's out
Y'all bring the V's out, I can even splurge
GT's wasn't me so I'm leaning towards the Spurs
Leaning towards the furs a lil' more to my nature
Mink, coyote, fox all in the nature
I get it in blocks I'm the Seymour Cake-ster
I give it on the arm, you can get it from me
Cause if prices was any cheaper y'all be sellin' it for free
Paid 2-3 sell it for 2-2-5
McDonald's is making more for profit off Super Size
I spit the truth inside, niggas wrote the fake shit
These niggas practicing snitching, y'all on some jake shit
Millz spoke on it, I agree with him
Can't even spar with niggas, what's the reason for a gym
Ain't hot enough to even work up a sweat
I been fire since Wu days with The Purple Cassette
So when you mention my name these niggas get offended
No chain on, just a five star pendant
General of that Riot so Squadddd Up
Feeling real prestigious hopping out that Porsche truck
I'm on top of my game and still climbing
They're not fucking with him, can't even peel off his hymen

It's the nigga with the mask on that would yack dude for jewels
Ain't gotta say it, that dude the truth, make me put that tool to use
And these niggas that be in the game shakin like Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf
Not Tourrette's, gotta rep my team to the end
Lambos to Ferraris to the Beamers to the Benz
If I blam it'll kill, never ran never will
Only thing that bleed on me is these jeans on my Timbs
Hat low, it's not a weak link in my squad
I'm LL, in too deep, I'm thinking I'm God
Far as rappers, I'm thinking they're frauds
Call 'em all Rubix Cubes cause I really used to think they was hard
Ha! For once trust me, you don't wanna start problems
The pound will make you Eddie Curry with a heart problem
So if you on the block with only a few grams, man
Then you a bird nigga, Toucan Sam
And any beat, I'mma air that, rappers just gotta wear that
Fox Brown should be the only one that can't hear that
Hit you in the spine or the belly, gun on me
I ain't Sticky Fingaz, I ain't leave mine in the telly, smell me?
Thank god he ain't fucking wit that red line
Cause I'll murk any nigga that disrespect mine
If it wasn't Fed time, or lock up or rec time
Dude'll be a Daily News headline
You ain't the best, what memo got sent?
If you got dogs, what kennel they in?
So if you wanna get fresh like a Mentos mint
Then it'll tempt those men with clips longer than Leno's chin
There ain't no type of guts wit you
You Terrell Owens, them niggas that wear eagles
They don't even wanna fuck with you
Me, fam? I was pimping weed dirt
Back when niggas used to rock Simpsons t-shirts
I'll give it to any nigga, I mean any nigga
Big man or skinny nigga, dare a dude tempt me, nigga
Auto or semi, nigga; dump till it's empty, nigga
They don't even want you in New York -- you like Penny, nigga
Check the time -- it's around that hour
Little niggas, they ain't 'round that powder
They ain't super or Luigi or Mario, ain't found that power
Plus they couldn't spit fire if they found that flower
Cowards, know the toys bust loco
While they trying to dap my hand like the Boy's Club logo
And yea that 5 slide and clock
I'm the million dollar baby, but I won't die trying to box
Don't want a piece of the cake, I won't the pie and all
I don't believe 'em when they say that they supplying the raw
You don't move white, you lying, dog
That's a never-ending story without the white flying dog
Son, these dudes is broke, don't know the feeling of bread
They in debt, tampon niggas, still in the red
And the fans keep asking if ya man stopped beefing
I call 'em Mr. Fantastic, tell 'em, ""Stop reaching""

Ah-ha, stop reaching!
Killa BH, son!
I'm ready to rock
Yo, ah-ha
When I come through, I'm like...a something
I can't remember
I'm that nice
Like the spice
Ah-ha
I can't even spit right",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-6-minutes-of-death-lyrics
Idols,Rage & The Machine,2016.0,"You're now listening to AraabMUZIK

Look, long live your idols, may they never be your rivals
Rakim was like Jesus, Chuck D wrote the Bible
G Rap was God, I learned to punch from Kane
Lived in Queens so on Farmers we would see Todd James
Remember the cover of Black Panther with the fat gold chains
Then Slick Rick had a million of 'em, so I wanted a million of 'em
Yeah, back in my first days
When we ain’t know who was the nicest nigga in 3rd Base
Which emcee was the worst before my emcee search
Some niggas thought Pete Nice, me, I thought MC Serch
This before I ever met Em, way before ""Hammer Dance""
This when I was asking Carrie Anne to make me Hammer pants
Smooth B was dope, Greg Nice had character
Before I ever knew image would even matter, bruh
Ice Cube raised me, gotta mention Gang Starr
Me and Premier tight right now, we in the same squad
Always tell me stories on the game and how it changed, y'all
Life don’t always come full circle, I can’t explain, God
Teacher to student
The overlap and the generational gap I'm seeing is prudent
So when I speak of pursuing
What we deemed as mere dreams and illusions, albeit a nuisance
I’m brewing from eyes that have seen through it
It’s no time for even a body to be reclusive
Execs'll feed you excuses, and if its seasoned, you chew it
We got old ideologies, I think we should renew it
The psychology for some of that reasoning's even stupid
For me it’s deeper than music, much deeper than music
They stole our musical freedom, up next it’s freedom of music
As a tenth grade drop-out I'm watching the aftermath
Of everything streaming and doing the extremist
This is true shit, don't take a genius to see the genius is stewing
Ain't got the reach to do it, so let me reach who can do it
It go


Look, look
If you live long you see your idols be your rivals
Hov was like the GOAT, congratulations on TIDAL
Salute, you broke through many barriers for us
When we couldn’t move the needle you carried us for us
Look forward, maybe in 30 years they'll implore us
Push to the back of the red ignore us
I think we nearing that border
Mr. Carter, who gon' fare for the authors?
They only there to extort us
Who gon be there to record us, nigga?
Even deeper who gon' care for our daughters?
And our sons just the vultures
We keep handing them the culture
And the Hip-Hop that raised this kid is one that spoke up
I'm pessimistic, I won't even get my hopes up
But if it’s gon' all implode before it blow up
Need more than overcharging for what they did to the Cold Crush
Just a PSA in lieu of the movement
Can't get a quarter back now, what about future music?
Really

If we try, we can fly to a place in the sun
All we need is precious dreams and a friend we can trust
We can go anywhere we want, any road that we can take
And we're never too far from tomorrow today, everybody...

So if I'm gone when tomorrow come
The mission for my only-born when tomorrow come
How will we receive songs when tomorrow come?
Here's my study for understudies to borrow from
New Rage & Machine, nigga, we got this
Is what you hear when label ideas meet a plot twist
Used to be faded from the killer talk
Now we suffocating from the pillow talk
Every verse like, ""damn, y'all love chivalry""
They offered me fame, as a man, I chose dignity, uh
Guess everything ain't for everybody
Maybe everybody ain't for everything
It ain't a thing, I'm looking through my career
I'm more the long game dude on how I choose to prepare
Not the richest, just the sickest, ask the dudes in your tier
Knew if I made it to the top I'd hate the views from up there
We don't value the same shit, I spoke through a despair
Stood out before it was cool to be weird
My nigga, you just appear
Before these niggas hit puberty
I was online talking like it's just you and me
The foolery, but since we hopping like rabbits
Calling everything that's dropping a classic
With all this modern day practice
Tactics that should rot in the ashes
Some are cut from the same cloth
Some have forgotten the fabric, listen
Raised a nigga that you rather leave at bay
She ain't walking in naked, she ain’t fashionably late
Have her bring your good shoes
So you can dodge around the rumors
In a suit that light the room up like Robert Downey Jr.'s
Fifth to the court tell I did this before
Without a Baron ask Karen, nothing civil in war
It's civil war, to judging off the shit that I saw
I'm trying to leave it so our kids'll have more
Tomorrow is bigger than all

Far away, no never
One thing I can always be sure of
Far away, no never, the promise of today
'Cause we're never far away, never
One thing I can always be sure of
Far away, no never, the promise of today",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-idols-lyrics
Dream On,#SomeLoveSeries,2014,"Now tell her we gotta clean this whole spot out
I don't care who she got coming I need five chairs
Tell Elva give me a mint Hookah
Give me a couple a peach Cirocs
And tell Bernice give me 10,000 in singles
Parks, keep me up in the headphones
Let me talk some shit to them real quick
It go
Uh, uh

They tell me life's a bitch, I'm just celebrating fuckin' it
Table full of bottles, now it's looking like my bucket list
Forward thinker, I ain't one to regress
Payin' no mind to these bitches, they just come with success
I spent Christmases giftless, went too many Decembers broke
Never got a stamp but found a way to push the envelope
They told me I'd be dead, I'd never make it out
If I ain't accomplish shit else, least I erased the doubt
I'm so unassuming, I can't figure why I'm hated now
Even made depression seem like that wasn't a major bout
My dreams big, niggas tried to take 'em down
The jewel is in the perspective, not the other way around
See my persona is calmer, Obama blended with Dahmer
Ever ponder your karma? Manana could see a llama
And if a nigga do, won't be complaints from me
I'll be all good with it, I did all I could with it, let's go

Chasing a dream, doing what they say I couldn't have
Spending money the government say I shouldn't have
Uh, and I'm taking my team with me
'Cause if none of its real my niggas gon' dream with me
Dream on, chic-a chic-a, dream on
If ever one of you fall I'm here for you to lean on
Dream on, chic-a chic-a, dream on
Steel sharpens steel 'til the whole teams strong

This could've went totally different, see I could've been Heist
And Heist could've been me, we did the same B&E's
Same charges, same guns I popped off, he was away by then
Had to do seven in that eight-by-ten (Talk to 'em)
Came home to no belongings, everything to gain
And nothing to lose, I'm in the polar opposite shoes
He wonder why we ain't as close as we was
How can I say it's been years, I'm not the Joe that I was
He see the car, the crib, a few chicks, and think it's come to fruition
If he knew the tuition I paid would view it different
Then we'd be in agreeance, cash won't be a grievance
Downplaying my achievements, afraid of how you'll receive 'em
Our bond is forever, I ain't gotta hide that
If I got, then you got, you can tell your pride that
I'll share it all, no complaints from me
Sometimes we all need a hand, real niggas understand, let's go

Chasing a dream, doing what they say I couldn't have
Spending money the government say I shouldn't have
Uh, and I'm taking my team with me
'Cause if none of its real my niggas gon' dream with me
Dream on, chic-a chic-a, dream on
If ever one of you fall I'm here for you to lean on
Dream on, chic-a chic-a, dream on
Steel sharpens steel 'til the whole teams strong

See the fame I never asked for it (Word)
I'd have been cool in a RAV4 delivering packages door-to-door
Ain't ask for the scrutiny, the acts of buffoonery
From ma'fuckers that ain't never been in a room with me
Fuck my perception, all of it is deception
Can't fuck just to fuck, got to use my discretion
But, that don't take away from the blessing
Nah, I'd do it all over within a second
Providing for the fam beats riding in the Lam
Riding for the fans, feel like catching lightning in a can
Understand, was built for this, made for it
Prayed for it, forget I even get paid for it
Forced to learn the game on our own without the coaches
Talent went unnoticed, this is hope for the hopeless
They get it all, no complaints from me
'Cause they gon' love how it feel when the dream become real
Joey

Chasing a dream, doing what they say I couldn't have
Spending money the government say I shouldn't have

Three Sides to a Story,Mood Muzik 2: Can It Get Any Worse?,2005,"My name's Derrick, I'm from Queens right there on Merrick
Raised of honesty, loyalty, good merits
Got a lil' sister and my pops just perished
And I just came home so my freedom I really cherish
Young when they bagged me, seven in the can is torture
And I just did that for manslaughter
Odds was against me, murder in the second degree
Made it less cuz I gave 'em a plea
That's the past, now a dude home tryna clean up his past
When all niggas know me for is the past
And my mind's always thinking how to pocket some cash
They know if something ever sparked it'll cock it and blast
Now I'm tryna live straight and get my act together
But my moms struggling, she putting scraps together
Long time ago, when I wasn't home she was cleaning my room
Cried when she found a gat in the dresser
Says no child of her's woulda had dat, never!
But with all the dirt I was doing
I felt like I had to protect her, I had to protect us
'Stead of me sellin' crack forever
She rather me in ShopRite, getting bags together
Past endeavors, won't allow me to get work
Forced me to get work
On apps they ask if you ever been to jail, like if I say yes you'll hire me
NIGGA DON'T LIE TO ME!
I gotta lil sister that's nine
Plus moms is chillin', wit some new dude I think she feeling
But he don't help with the bills and I'm back on the strip
So we don't go broke, I'm back to this hammer that I have to tote
Stash ya kno, I'm killin' em, only nigga on the Ave. with coke
Only man in the house, I gotta bring in cash
And those two checks a month that mom get don't last
Lil Sally's real young, she developing fast
Oh, you thinking the same thing, it's a hell of a task
Then it clicked me, plain clothes, cops came to get me
But knew that I had mine on threaten to hit me
And I moved swiftly, said they had a warrant
They knew about it all they said they had an informant
I'm back in this caged up cell
With the apes in jail, now I'm back in this eight by twelve
See I tried to live right
But society ain't made for niggas to live right
Mommy just write
Mommy make sure Sally keep her shit tight
And I'll be home real soon, don't cry, it's aiight

I know it might seem like it's all good
But this is what it's like in the hood
I rep my set like you should
But this is what it's like in the hood
I know it might seem like it's all good
But this is what it's like in the hood
I rep my set like you should
But this is what it's like in the hood

My names Sally, and I'm from Queens I'm not happy
Dad passed away, moms remarried
I gotta big bro, but he's in jail
Moms said for some things that he used to sell
And I'm always with step-dad, his names Beau
And theres some things about him that my mom don't know
And he says if I tell that it won't be pretty
And I'm really scared of em, he's already hit me
He touches me places I don't like it
And I ain't talking bout a hug or goodbye kiss
I mean touch me places that's private
And he don't just touch he put summin inside it
He says the more he does that, I'll start to like it
Hand over my mouth so I'm quiet
Moms only wit 'em cuz our money is low
I'm sixteen but I'm shaped like a twenty year old
And my moms in love so she makes excuses
But she looks at me and sees scrapes and bruises
Why step daddy gotta take me thru this
Help, somebody, I'm getting raped I can't do this
Nobody understands I'm weary
Get goosebumps anytime a man come near me
Know how it feel to have a man use you for a cushion
All the while moaning and pushin
You try to push him, he's getting bothered
You yell and you scream but he starts going harder
Trust me, it's summin you don't wanna be apart of
Cuz even when it's over, your life, it'll scar ya
Visit my bro, he can tell I'm sad
Staring hard at my stomach he can tell I'm fat
He can tell I'm mad
But step daddy touched me, fucked me, you think that I can tell him that?
Beau called the cops on him, could I tell him that?
Yep, thought you'd agree so I keep it all to me
Baby on the way, and I'm not working
And I kno it's his cause I used to be a virgin
Derrick says he'll handle it, wipe my tears
He don't know, this is what it's like for years
And it falls on def ears
Damn mommy please come home, please mommy don't leave us alone
Some secrets are hard to keep
Some secrets make it hard to sleep
And sleep is the only time I feel safe
Still the act haunts me, and I know I'ma wake up with step daddy on me

I know it might seem like it's all good
But this is what it's like in the hood
I rep my set like you should
But this is what it's like in the hood
I know it might seem like it's all good
But this is what it's like in the hood
I rep my set like you should
But this is what it's like in the hood

My names Beau, gotta chick named Pam that I live with
But she's always in church, real religious
I hadda son he was young he was gifted
Til a nigga killed him a week before Christmas
Three shots close range with a handgun
I knew before I met Pam that it was Pam's son
I knew when I pulled the Mill out harder
And went on a manhunt just to kill they father
Derrick and my boy hadda mutual friend
That put me on doing what I gotta do for revenge
Derricks coming home now, and he's gonna get it
And I kno he'll be lookin for me with a biscuit
Not hard to find, got them TECs in handy, and
I'm in his house having sex with him family
I got his mom on the bed and the canopy
And I'm with his sister molesting her candy
Now he know it all
His friend probably told em, and you can't hide nothing in a hood so small

But then it came Sunday, Beau ain't hafta work
Just humped on Sally, Pam's in church
Derrick bust in, Beau just froze
White shit on his nose, Sally getting her clothes
Screams, ""Get ready for your funeral Beau""
And then he reach to his hip and let a few of 'em go
Cause he's packin but Sally starts gaspin
Holdin her stomach, I guess she started having contractions
Beau grabbed his, now they both got heat
Just gunnin, both ignoring the seed that's coming
Now Sally's in the crossfire, screams out stop
Holes in the wall, now the scenes getting hot
Next 30 seconds on the scene is the cops
Yellow tape up, now the scenes getting blocked
Barricades up, yep, you already kno y'all
Ambulance there, streets full of patrol cars
Cops on the mega phone, ""come down now""
But it all calmed down somehow
Beau comes out, hands showing, carrying his arms
Derrick comes down, little Sally in his arms
Yep, nuttin to say, she was hit by a stray
Nope! Shots done ricochet, cops take him away
And now some niggas miss em
But it wasn't the guns that killed Sally, nah it was the dumb niggas wit em
When we gonna learn to treat our people sacred
There's some type of way kid, we're all related
When we gonna grow and get rid of the hatred
Cuz this shit happens on a regular basis, this shit happens on a regular basis
This type of shit happens everyday kid

I know it might seem like it's all good
But this is what it's like in the hood
I rep my set like you should
But this is what it's like in the hood
I know it might seem like it's all good
But this is what it's like in the hood
I rep my set like you should
But this is what it's like in the hood",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-three-sides-to-a-story-lyrics
Family Reunion,Mood Muzik Vol. 3.5 ,2008.0,"Uh-oh (uh), it's that time again
It's been too long, it's family reunion (Mic check, mic check)
We gotta school y'all to the game
(One, two, one, two)
You know what? Let's talk to 'em
Let's go (let's go, the wolves is out, nigga)

Ain't nobody tryna rap or play me
I'll be at they crib with a couple hammers and a black old AV
Black gon' pay me, still get the smack off Baisley
'Cause I'm touching more diesel than Shaq old lady
Boy, you did it, I done it, I get it, I punish
The shit that I come with'll seperate a rib from a stomach
I'm the boss, when I spit it, you love it, matter fact
I'm a Viking, I need a whole village to plumage
Yeah, the nigga is here, the city is scared
You got the throne? Then I think I need to sit in your chair
We could really get physical here
And the sky's the limit nigga, I put your whole clique in the air
Baby, so quit playing, 'fore the clips spray 'em
And have his ass M.I.A. like Nick Saban
His whole shit caved in, my whole clique cavemen
Hard bodied nigga, my whole shit pavement
You can't spit if you dead in the ground
In the woods, where you had to be found
And it's good that you getting it now
In the precinct confessing it now
I can't fuck with the rest of you clowns, 

I am the silence before the storm, Lincoln Park, the Audubon
Slang rock on the same block that the water on
I be more than gone, run and get your order form
Next time I record a song, gon' put my daughter on
'Cause she realer than most niggas, I tote triggers
For you broke niggas and gold diggers with no figures
That why I palm the heater, for all you non-believers
I'm on your ass like white on Rice, I'm Condoleezza
Better con the preacher, you tryna get on a feature
Better get your casket bastard, I'm gon' eat ya
We ain't in the same weight class, your fake-ass
Couldn't stop a nigga with brake pads, I'm way past
Anything that you ever did, 
I'm better kid
And we never sweat a bid
, it's easy to get a SIG
In the bing, I'm like Ving Rhames, I bring pain
I sling 'caine off the wing like I'm King James
Y'all doubting who
When I spit the whole lead, they be calling Code Red like Mountain Dew
'Fore I count to two you could get your back blown
'Cause your gimmicks out of minutes like a TracFone
Get back homes, I'm back on my shit
I don't mingle, 
I'm like Pringles: stacking my chips
Clapping my fifth, you the test me type
Coming out with a Blade to get Wesley Sniped
So the cops could arrest me, right, it's not happening
You ain't ever gonna get on, so stop rapping
H20 coming this summer, so stop asking
All heat like Wall Street, ya stock crashing
Now the Feds want to read his rights
Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ, I got passion
I'm Black and all my niggas getting this 'feti
We in the Chevy and ready to pop tags
[Chorus: Joe Budden & 
Fabolous
]
So whatever you try and do lil niggas
I already done (Done)
And since you wan' live by it lil nigga
Then die by the gun (Gun, hol' up)
So whatever you try and do lil nigga (
Like we always do about this time
)
I already done (Done) (
D-d-damn
)
So how the fuck you gon' win little nigga? (
Yes
)
I've already won (Won) (
Let's go, uh-huh
)

Ayo, money is the root of all evil I thought
But when I'm broke is when I usually have the evilest thoughts
That's when the arms come out, like sleeves when it's short
With more bullets than your favorite wide receiver has caught
And that Randy Mossberg, ya Steve Smith & Wesson ya
The shoes pop up like Instant Messenger
You've got mail, nah, nigga, you got shells
And my MAC, you can't use for iChat
I've got that, confused that with lie flat
And my gat is on leg like thigh tat
I that nigga, who you dudes?
Some broke niggas who tryna get some YouTube views
So 'less you want a point blank, boy, you're too close
Bail's in pocket, this is Lawyer Lou Los
I'm pretty sure more hotties seen me in that four door ridey
Double pipes like a sawed off shotty, nigga

I flow sickly, riding, bumping old Biggie
Roll with me or lose weight, Nicole Richie
Fuck plat', if I don't reach diamond fame
I treat a nigga face like that old Simon game
Figured out why men try us, 
'cause we O.D
On rims and thin tires, for that we Len Bias
All it take is a punch, he ain't brave, he a punk
I'll put his family in boxes, meet the Brady Bunch
How y'all feel yourselves? Should kill yourselves
Us Cowboys don't need you, you Bill Parcells
And you ain't gotta empty your pockets when the K's out
Whatever you holding is mine, we my PayPal
See I don't get how this guy is a threat
I make his life inept for a pie to the neck
Ride or die, I do both nigga, ride to the death
I a cappella the whole left side of his chest
Not retiring, still got that pension pending
Tryna pop the hood and see the engine missing
Double barrelled shotgun, how your men get missing
She got pretty brown eyes and she in mint condition
Oh, the SIG in the car, you dissin' moi
Take the ratchet go home and just Chris Benoit
Tell a bird like it is, you promise the broad
I one line her, you Isiah Thomas the broad
I could send a clique cartridge at a nemesis target
And catch a R.O.R. on some Jena 6 charges
Nah, I'll put this thing away, 
I don't even need a
Whole hairdo to clip 'em, all it take is one finger wave
Been in the  for days, show you how I'm real
Come home to the truck with the Optimus Prime grill
Handed out crack, got the scene poppin' off
They not sleepin on 'em, the fiends is nodding off
All real, tell me how you a thug and you Superman
I just seen you in the club doing the Superman
A bunch of clowns homes, all I
Need in this world is the pound chrome, Huxtable brown stone
Major paper, cake by the layers
If these dudes is live, I'm the Create-A-Player
They callin 'em Kings when they so so hot
Something's wrong with that picture, must be Photoshopped
I don't promote violence, but when sparkin' the flame, blame
Arms start waving like the Carlton Banks dance
When them tools go pop, it move whole blocks
Come around with your dog and get Kujo shot
These MCs is lame, I try to be a MC with brains
These niggas is MC Brains
Being nice, rappers is far from being nice
I'm on the rooftop recording, niggas is being sniped
It's like

So whatever you try and do lil niggas
I already done (Done)
And since you wan' live by it lil nigga
Then die by the gun (Gun, hol' up)
So whatever you try and do lil nigga
I already done (Done)
So how the fuck you gon' win little nigga?
I've already won (Won)

Words of a Chameleon,A Loose Quarter,2012,"Check it, I'm the voice of every dead nigga's secrets
That's why the fucktards want me dead 'fore I can speak it
Y'all call it crazy, I'm the heartbeat of every aborted baby
High off every line snorted in the 80s
Let it breathe, no wonder why his thoughts ratchet
See the world through the shades that Stacks wore in his casket
I steal his body from the graveyard on foot, ain't no lookin' back
Bring him on tour with me and when it's over put him back
If you couldn't tell, the behavior
Says if a nigga send me to Hell it's a favor
I never felt that was major
God forgive me or don't, maybe He'll help later
Until I'll share Pac's nightmare post Quad's elevator
Which taught me not to doubt a coward for a thing
Yin-yang theory, shit Juwan Howard got a ring
All it takes is the smallest nigga in your camp to get eternal
Half a match book will transform to an inferno
And jail's so grotesque
That 'cause of my past I can't bask in my success
Peep how my brain masturbates
I mean, I wake up, walk on my deck
And stare at a beautiful yard that just reminds me of the yard
I unlock a cell, a buried man, wrongly accused
Bet it all, the judges to put him there, won't be amused
This ain't Joe y'all, more like the mind of every rape victim
Who can't retrace the face of the nigga that had his way with 'em
When my heart stops it crops
Every 9-1-1 call that took too long
But don't look at it wrong
'Cause the irony of my group's name is, though he seem the luckiest, where we lay our heads seems to be where it's bloodiest
To say we're rebels would imply we're against
That's a lie, nigga, we just convinced
So in case the puppet-masters didn't know Joe
They tried makin' us the guinea pigs
We just killed it and kept it as a logo",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-words-of-a-chameleon-lyrics
So Hard,A Loose Quarter,2012,"What I mean is
I was tryna be on the same page with you
I want no miscommunication and none of that
Ya know what I mean?
(I need that magic)
It’s simple

Ass fat but she eating right, Catch her up in whole foods
Fuck emotion, she the only thing I go through
I did some thinking fore the guard even approached you
Couldn’t beats the same, GD’s must already sold you
Moving like a stripper so I’m thinking like a nigga though
I’ll treat you like a lady so you know how it feels
She want a pole in the room, I said one is already there
I just need you to test it out and let me know how it feels, now check it
You who I’m tryna build that canope with
Relax, good Dick will make you lose your sanity quick
That beat hard enough to be your first round fantasy pick
But I won’t be coming up off bread on some philanthropy shit
Fuck for an hour, out the shower, look good as fuck when she lather
Got me using gay ass words like lavish
She rather me speak in code, really I think it’s sexy
So when I say, ""Times are hard"", she know how to respond correctly

I see you on top, screaming don’t stop
Me – just glued to you
Touching on every spot
Things that I can get used to do
You make it so hard
You make it so hard
You got me so hard
Got me trying grab another rubber
You got me saying (my dick hard as a motherfucker)
She said let it happen naturally, I ain’t force it
Practice control when she was feeling like I force it
Got a couple ex’s, you’ll go crazy so she lost it
The past is so foggy, well no wonder she’s exhausted
I guess the dum, that’s where the drama lies
A real nigga, I’d hate to see lil mama cry
I go up in it, she be shaking like she traumatized
Dick so hard it won’t bend, no it won’t compromise
I hit it from the back, that ass be sitting right
Almost wanna say I love you when I get inside
And I don’t think there’s a position that we didn’t try
Though we gotta be a couple that she wish we didn’t thrive
Sound moronic but she be on the Oxxy
Say even when it hurt it feel good so she don’t stop me
Call me on the horn to say your naughty thoughts are wrong
Anytime I send her pictures with balls shorts on

I see you on top, screaming don’t stop
Me – just glued to you
Touching on every spot
Things that I can get used to do
You make it so hard
You make it so hard
You got me so hard
Got me strying, grab another rubber
You got me saying (my dick hard as a motherfucker)

She keep a low pro, so subtle with it
So hard, probly why she having trouble with it
Uh, my baby far from a push around
And she don’t get it up unless you bout to put it down
We can make a movie if we wanted to
And a sequel, watching back to back, one or two
3 and 4, in every scene I be right under you
'Cuz I love how you ride for yours, now tell me what you wanna do

I see you on top, screaming don’t stop
Me – just glued to you
Touching on every spot
Things that I can get used to do
You make it so hard
You make it so hard
You got me so hard
Got me strying, grab another rubber
You got me saying (my dick hard as a motherfucker)

Oh got me so hard
Aye eh aye
So, you got me so hard
Got me so hard oh
You got me so hard
So, you got me so hard
You got me so hard baby
You got me so hard
So, you got me so hard yea
Oh oh oh uh oh oh
You got me so, so hard
So hard",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-so-hard-lyrics
The Hard Part,Mood Muzik 4.5: The Worst Is Yet To Come,2011,"Closer than close well
Closer than most
I just see so much in you
And I want a better view
I want to look deeper into you yeah
See God built everybody differently ya mean
Ready for The Hard Part(hard part hard part)
Everybody ain't got the same makeup
We ain't all built alike(built alike built alike)
Only thing is(hard part hard part) when you put in that spot
You can ask yourself What are you built for?

Uh I'm getting ready for the hard part
This the first time me and you have been this far apart
Uh not the first time that you packed
But the first time that you left first time that I just stood and watched
More like stood there shocked look at what I've done
The first time that I conceded and pride won
That was our first time in court together but not really (Why?)
Cuz I wasn't allowed to even look your way ('member?)
That's that paper work you filed right
Can't communicate with the woman bearing my child right
We both lost it shit was a wild night
Unfortunately we didn't go down without a fight
Always said that I wouldn't know what to do without you
Loved what I knew about you not what was new about you
You step back and notice shit got realer
Cuz y'all are closer than most but still ain't looking familiar

I'm doing 90 on the road hand on the 45
If I can't do nothing else but survive feel me
I got that Al Green playing I'm feeling on shorty thighs
And since I'm the one that y'all wanna try
Just know I'm ready to ride(Uh)
I'm on my grind till the clock stop
The shit is all happening on God's watch
So if you see me pulled over with the car parked(Uh)
I'm just getting ready for the hard part(Uh)

Uh I'm getting ready for the hard part
Well fuck it this what we all wanted (talk to 'em)
So I figured fuck it I can use another crack at
So what I ran from for 8 years I'm right back at
Fucking with a major now I got my group with me
Good cuz the scrutiny usually has me acting stupidly
And even though they all think that I'm a weirdo
When I look to my left and my right they right there though
They was naive when they said that we was all through
All walk a same path feel like we the Lord's group
The industry don't know the type of damage we gon' cause you
Same one y'all called flukes is looking like war troops
At The point where even legends give respect
Went from outside of the game to getting lead in by the best
'Cause yeah, won't stop till our title they can't argue
Though we closer than most still I gotta thank Marshall


Closer to family closer to my regime
Closer to Goapele, I mean closer to my dreams
I was closer to the block was closer to them fiends
So nah I ain't from the streets but we closer than we seem
Check it closer to comfort closer to wealth
But not closer than you can afford you gotta know yourself
Closer to a lead so it's murder in the booth
Say they closer to the real but that's further from the truth
And I'm closer than the people that's wishing for my demise
Fuck me worry bout that sickness you got inside
Figure I'm just a reflection of your miserable life
Since you less fortunate, you wanna picture him deprived
Why I stay to myself and get closer to rap
Cuz getting closer to you will be getting closer to that
And since that's a little ways I'm kinda closer to fruition
I just kick my feet back and got a chauffeur for the distance

Ha Joey ya mean y'all throw that shit my way
Right field center field left field
I'm a golden glove winner try it
Y'all throw that shit my way I'm totally built for this
Are you though?

Pray for me
Pray for me
Pray for me
Just pray for me
'Body pray for me
Need y'all to just pray for me (Joey)
'Body pray for me
Need y'all to just pray for me (uh)

Now if it goes to the wire
I will never fall, I got the soul of a fighter
Walk barefoot over the coal, through the fire
I thought the toll would be lighter but make sure that blunt's rolled a little tighter
I tell 'em I'm just lookin' for some peace of mind
But they say I'm only working with a piece of mine
If I'ma do it'll be of my own accord, no crush
Swear to God I never called upon the Lord so much
Play the corner of the club, laughin' at the wannabes (why?)
It's ironic, 'cause they 'erything I wanna be
Would light a ton of reef
But that's gon' unleash everything I'm tryna hide underneath
Uh, then I'd lose all I've earned
Uh, and if there's two things that I've learned (what?)
Is I'm the only thing at stake (two)
And when you the only thing real really you the only thing fake
Uh, must be time to escape from that
And fuck rhymes, might be time to escape from rap
Why should I be the only nigga to escape from the act?
So I lie since everybody just escape from fact
Yo, that sucker shit niggas be on, I can't dig it
Joe, won't lose even if you plan to rig it
Yeah, nuttin' to prove with no fear of how I'm depicted
I'm here, won't move, I don't care to be evicted
You don't like how I move? (Well)
Well, I ain't gon' keep still, any nigga want me killed
Wanna leave me in the streets peeled
Well, if it happens, it happens, I believe in free will
Just know that ain't how we built
I'll call niggas that will dead you for a cheap thrill
When the clip's empty, they gon' try and refill
And I'ma be the dude to try stop 'em like ""Please chill"" (come on)
Y'all know what I'm about
They keep puttin' up roadblocks, I keep findin' alternate routes
Now success seems likely everybody wanna try me
I’m all for it, can’t trip me up, won’t fall for it
I'm just a man without a care (what else?)
Neighbor to heartache, roommate with despair (what else?)
Reminded my past is darker
'Cause when AM died (nigga), I was starin' at Travis Barker
Wishin' there was something I could say to make him cheer up
(So) And so I prayed, and he teared up
I ain't wanna see him go through that
The same shit that I feel, I just never show you that
Guess it's none of nobody business
And it just makes you look weaker, every joke is just smoke
Gotta look deeper, never mind, don't bother
'Cause some of y'all are smart e—nough and got sense
That if you try harder you'll get a glimpse of everything
That I harbor, we all ain't got the strength to be a martyr
So to anyone who ever loved me (what?)
I apologize, and I'm sorry
Whole-heartedly, can't change
It's just part of me, it's not music, shit's art to me
Too fucked up to drive, here's the car key
I don't care where we go just get it far from me
Choices I don't wanna make but I know I have to
World's goin' faster since my ride or die chose the latter
Lookin' for a rush out of habit
Proof there's a such thing as too much for a addict
Ain't the nigga I'm belittled as, riddled ass
Nigga come from middle class, when you speak to me show a little class
Dropped out of school, 'cause a nigga couldn't sit through class
Learnt to fall asleep through the sound of a pistol's blast
I come from where dad taught mom to get high (can you hear me?)
But she strong so we still got by (huh?)
When I picked up the drug why the fuck was they surprised
If it wasn't for your genes I wouldn't lust the supply
I come from a whole hood tellin' me that I'm next
Handin' me a mag, must've noticed I was complex (uh)
They say that you a wild individual
You just not gettin' my style, you too typical
'Erybody got a word for me
Shit y'all deem important ain't pertinent to me, nigga
Put your opinion with a feather, and balance that
Grab medicine when the success and the talent match

Somebody please pray for them
Uh, pray for them
Need y'all to just pray for them

Need y'all to just pray for them

Fuck niggas mad at me for?
I ain't done shit to y'all
Just doing me like y'all should
Maybe that step got skipped to y'all
Maybe this lifestyle ain't fit for y'all
What this is for?
Work so hard so your kids could ball
When you go to the bank to make a big withdraw
It ain't shit to y'all
Now, minions' opinions are venomous
They know I'm infamous nigga I've been in the hood
Swimming in cinnamon women my living conditions
Of Benjamins spending are good
Sweet success I'm reminding them of
Always while they online in the club
While I'm inside with some white girls prolly getting drunk
Doing lines in the club, what we talking 'bout?
Made off like Madoff that shit they say be way off
No days off, you laid off, my car, my house both paid off
She already know what it is
Hop in my car, my house, I break her off
Her blouse, her draws, she take 'em off
My couch, get it hard then make it soft
Got hawks for all that talking when we walking
Just stay clear of that
See you when we see you we won't see you
You ain't where we at
You got aware, my back turned but I hear
Fully autos I bear it so if it ain't God I don't fear it

All these bitches is fiending
Guess they love my demeanor
They love the way I be leaning
I used to pop a few xannies
Blend it with promethazine
I started out by my lonely
And then I brought my whole team in
Now every show it’s sold out
Fans just waiting and screaming
We made it come to fruition
When we was broke and just dreaming
These hoes under-dressed to impress
In every section I be in
I understand why they hate me
I gave them plenty of reasons
What we talking 'bout?
Are we talking 'bout you?
Are we talking 'bout him?
Can't be talking 'bout me
'Less we talking 'bout them
They talking 'bout us like we neck and neck and I never knew
You check for check, she on check for you
She throw it back and I catch it too
Y'all gossiping juniors, keep my name and them rumors
We don't let them consume us, we go straight to consumers
So if you mad got aware, my back turned but I hear
Fully autos I bear so if it ain't God I don't fear it

Joe Budden Freestyles on Flex | Freestyle #008,Funk Flex Freestyles,2016.0,"My name is Joe Budden
One fourth of the group Slaughterhouse
And I came to tell the truth with Funkmaster Flex
Mic check, mic check
One two, one two
First of all I want to shout out to House Gang
Second of all and probably should be first of all, I want to shout out New Jersey
Third of all I want to shout out to Flex
I love everybody man

It's like my little dude smiled with excitement, asked if I know..
Wait, I stopped the whip, didn't acknowledge it
I figured most of these styles I godfathered it
That's Godfather shit, words be my only hollow tips
That moment like I can stop time like with that Hollow kid
Gospel with the Apollo shit, sorry I'm no apologist, wait
Here's a glimpse of my stake and then if you may
Niggas couldn't commence their successes without my mistakes
See I tend to think in opposites, never moderate
Look, momma, I made it this far without a scholarship
The drama bouncing multiple commas I deposited
All the more reason to look up 'cause I'm an optimist
Nah, I’m a protagonist, speak with such honestness
Bound to keep it funky with the blood stream of parliament
No argument, follow in the blueprint that my hood wrote
So every footnote put my foot in that quote
The way it appears the grading system ain’t fair
Same result as the turtle chasing the hare
Is what these races appear to differ
Paces to gear help at making that clear
You niggas ran off on the plug, not me, I stayed right there
So if it’s gotta be a thing the shotty gon’ be clean
You see the rage is even deadly outside of the machine
Anytime they thought they had me robbed, got nothing off me
Ninas had to drop uptown, brother was saucy
The Nina woke a dreamer right up, cup of coffee
Blink of an eye, Harlem niggas..

Fab what up though? Shout out to you
Araab what up I see you my nigga you couldn’t be here
But you here in spirit
And shout out to all the fans
And shout out to Jersey City, Albee Al
Check this out we gon do this like this

Listen, you never see how I handle the spot
Been on both sides of the fence, seen the hammock and cot
I give a fuck if young niggas understand it or not
Sometimes you gotta show the kids you really ran with the Roc
It’s like I’m back on Def Jam again
You niggas keep being deaf, I just jam again
Ya’ll see how I’m handling
New Benz, big boy coupe, seat reclining though
Black piping on white seats blastin' Domino
I pull up, honk that horn, she know it’s time to go
She take long, windows down, I’m screaming “vámonos”
Lately I’ve been dealing with hate, all kind of trolls
I’m just tryna stack this bread, Phyllis Hyman notes
But off that, my main point, back to rhyming though
Bitches get beside themselves like watching Quantico
And that fool get wet by the tool
Play superhero here, might lead to a dead pool
I'm surrounded by fuck niggas, always hated you niggas
I'm feeling like Trump, nigga, I'm writing the trump nigga
Them boys got you..
Jesus, Mary and Joseph
Listen, relax partner
Should back slap both you and the Snapchat blogger
Wish ya'll were a tad smarter
Besides you jabbed first, but both knew my jab back harder
A tad fast like zab at the sparring
, that magna carter
Look, for any man to bad bar up
The Joe can get hot, just ask Starbucks
Act of horror vs faggot's aura
Feel like a bad father that ain't been off the bar much
Listen, the bad charger to your Apple harbor
Meanwhile you're mortal, you're more magic marker
It's an issue, Joe make it a big one
Can't Bell Biv DeVoe your way out of this one
So I'm taking off Spring from my offspring
Since the young boy want jump, we get him all spring
Give him a reason since child don't like me
I'm seasoned, better ask Kyle bout Lowry
Listen, the top MC rep's over
My nigga, I keep shooting 'till nothing's left over
And while we're talking bout leftovers
Four niggas...

Quality of Life,UnKnown,2011.0,"Parks on the board
Klasikx on the beat
Hood on my shoulder
Im on some quality of life shit right now b
Just want my gas tank on F
I want Trey Songz away from all my hoes
Im fucking with you, we dont love these hoes

Some niggas drink away the pain
I think of ways to gain
And it happens so naturally you'd think its preordained
Straight from Lyor's Reign
Escaped from the ball and chain
Can't tell if I was in it for the long haul or fame
Im laying low on the island
Been learned the saying no is a talent
Niggas want beef but keeping up is a challenge
Can't tell if Im trying to get even or find a balance
But im much closer I won't front
Hoes love it so so but yet he so blunt
A charming asshole, warn them all the same
Tell them I feel the ice as its forming in my veins
Chasing the high so much that we both hurting
To the point it ain't even about the other person
So we even, Im in love with her rear and her pussy
And she in love with idea of what I could be
On top of the world but desire to fall
Cuz Whats the point of dreaming big if you've acquired it all?
But if lyricism is back, I helped it spearhead
If we ordering CL's make mine a year ahead
I skipped the club line and dont get turned around
So girls come at a high volume, I dont turn em down
No pregnant hoes and no minors
A-1 bars with Em as a co-signer
I filled the counter up without checking the cost yet
I ain't rich my nigga but check the way I off set
Dont get confused by the Bentleys and the Corvettes
Got stories from my hood that will rival those of war vets
Jersey City helped to mold what I amounted to
My only beef is they dont hold theyself accountable
So a few resent me, But I'm cool with it
They handed me the city before I knew what to do with it
This last chick that I put under the wing
Just taught me the younger the age, the younger she think
I mean, she shaped like a stallion with bomb sex
But dont understand me when Im trying not to be complex
Done raising my voice, I ain't with it
Fuck is the point of arguing if she ain't gonna get it?
Plus my future is now, hers is down the pipeline
And thats the difference between a good time and a life time
But my current situation
Is I keep meeting chicks who need a way out of their current situation
Some cool, some silly, some serious
They trying to come up, Im trying to come period
Na I dont do the pickup line
I give her the number to the chauffeur with a pickup time
One weekend its Vegas, the next its Turks
Hard to love a dude over him when he come with that many perks
I need a sign she attracted to more than designer fabrics
If by chance I am passed my prime, im trying to lap it
Too many checks to deposit
Smoke too many bones, no skeletons in my closet
But talking rap off the work that I got
If I ain't crack your top 10 you should reserve me a spot
Till then I play the strip club, and Jerz rockin
So when life lands before my eyes its all worth watching
Im about honor and respect
And boredom just made me rent a condo on the edge
Cause God gave me everything I was hoping for, doe galore
Trying to quit smoking more
Just me her, going raw
So how could we end up trusting each other?
When our bond started out with us judging each other?
Both fronting like ""yea, we just fucking each other""
But nobody getting fooled while we bluffing each other
Got one broad, theres too much history with
Another thats never happy, too much misery with
Another that will guzzle shots until she literally sick
And another that only text me to say ""give me some dick""
I swear, how could you ever say Joe went soft?
When if I told you my problems, you'd think im showing off
I keep it quiet, its all covered on my end
My quality of life is pretty high end",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-quality-of-life-lyrics
Forgive Me,Escape Route,2009,"[How many times have I hurt you?
How many times have you hurt me?
And how many times I've been on my knees
Begging begging please...
Forgive Me]
(Intro Joe Budden)
(Anybody who listens to Joe Budden
I never got off on image, actually
My image is not giving a fuck about image
My image is a regular, real live nigga
Who will always give it to you just the way it is
I'm never gonna fabricate, I'm never gonna lie
And I'm never gonna get outta character
Because the industry made me do so
Sooner or later you gotta take a step back
And really just look
At the situation, and analyze
Any really think about it
And you gotta say ""Is the risk worth the reward?""
Let's go)

Yo I'm only human, ain't to be worshiped (Nah)
I'm only human, I ain't perfect (Nah)
I might say some things and reword it
You could blame it on my roots, deep Jerz shit
Bet some things were never instilled
I might make threats I won't never fulfill (Why?)
Hoping you're smart enough to use some will
And do as I say out of fear that I will
They say time will reveal, but I'm jammed up
But I'm staring at the clock and the hands stuck
Ever so tender, it seems the things y'all never forget I never remember
Listen, it's your fault you assumed I grew
But if I'm all about me, then wheres there room for you?
Rather not rewind but fast forward
Forgiveness, all I can do is ask for it
Forgive me

[How many times have I hurt You? (have I hurt you?)
And how many times I've been on my knees?
Begging begging please...]
(Joe Budden)
(Uhh! I'm only human like y'all and shit
I ain't a robot, I ain't superhero
I'm entitled to shit like y'all niggas
Here we go, check me out, Talk to 'em, look)

Might say some things that's outlandish
But when I do, I'm thinking without standards
I apologize, take it as a letter
In spite of my actions just know I was raised better (much better)
I'm aware my opinions hated
So why the fuck am I so opinionated?
My bad Method Man, out of respect
I'mma scrap them 5 pages I wrote toward Deck
Cuz that ain't have anything to do with you
Till I made it have everything to do with you
Shutting up is unusual
So I'm back to letting my pen state
What I do to dudes (I mean)
Outside of music, outside of rapping
Cuz none of that should interfere with life happening
And you can look me dead in the eyes
If you don't know shit just
Know I took your advice, holla at me(Going Going Going Gone)

[How many times have I hurt you? (have I hurt you?)
And how many times I've been on my knees
Begging begging please...]
(Joe Budden)
(At least I listen though I'm open minded enough to
A nigga tell me something I'mma take heed to it
Only if its good shit though I be my own filter
It's that On Top Music
Think more niggas should be like that
Follow my lead, I left a trail for niggas, follow it)

Yo, y'all ain't looking at the man that you would see
Ain't looking at the man that you should see
Ain't looking at the man that I could be
Treat me like I'm new to the game, still a rookie
Like a newborn straight out the pussy
Or is everybody straight out and just pussies (faggots)
In a state of confusion, what I intended is never the conclusion
(talk to em!)
I'm losing, normally the one they accusing
Maybe that explains my seclusion
But when you grown to see that the stakes high
You at least know to never make the same mistake twice (look!)
They say the real is gone, I represent this shit
What you see is what you get, no representative
From now on get a redefined me
If ya see another mishap don't mind me
Forgive Me

[Forgive Me
How many times (have I hurt you?)
Forgive Me
How many times have you?
Forgive Me
How many times I've been on my knees
Begging begging please...]
(Joe Budden)
I know I hurt a lot of niggas
Words are piercing
Sometimes them shits hurt like bullets
I wanna make amends
Not to everybody though
Some of y'all niggas I mean to offend
Fuck y'all!)",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-forgive-me-lyrics
Hiatus,Mood Muzik Vol. 3.5 ,2007.0,"Two years, waits up,
 still sleep, wake-up
Girl gone, break-up, mind right, cake up
Friends came, friends left
Bullshit is endless, been next
Hip-Hop, really not impressed
Maybe just my love died
Sober, still above high
Slugs fly, eyes sucked dry, still a thug cries
I cried 'till I can't cry no more
Believe my own nonsense, I can't lie no more
Soul dead, breathless; I can't sigh no more
Wheels already fell off, I can't ride no more
I guess I pack up all of my belongings and just troop it
You know it's beef when a smart nigga gets stupid
Cause then it's justified, rationale nullified
Steven shot 8 times, almost thought my brother died
See he was raised different, I know his mother tried
His arms tied, I'm trying to teach dude to touch the sky
But still shorty wild, turned on by 40 Cals
Was young, never saw me wild, clutch Robert Horry style
No wonder I picked-up triggers to beef
I only ever fist fought wit niggas bigger than me
I never been the one to try and grab shit in my reach
Incompliant, you have now witnessed the breach
I feel like life is all written, understand my math
Got on my knees, told God I had a plan, He laughed
I mean... hours passed, no sleep, cowards get a slow leak
Showered twice the whole week, powerless control freak
Thinkin' about suicide, won't though I'm scrutinized
Life nigga; do or die, hood want 'em crucified
Jewelry on, fresh dressed, model broads excess
Phone calls, death threats, tell me what's the next step
What's what, who's who, paranoid as usual
Grippin' on my deuce-deuce, either way a lose-lose
All I need is one mic
, razor blades, gun fights
Room without no sunlight, understand son's plight
If done right, won't seek and fail
I don't follow the path, I'm creatin' my own to leave a trail
It's no rhyme or reason nor reason or rhyme
No more food for thought, shit deceasin' the mind
Now they doubtin' my desire, second guessin' my fashion
Like bringin' of weapons of mass in when you question my passion
I live for this, not the 
Baguettes
 and the fame
Got signed havin' an answer, then the question changed
Sayin' Jump Off don't sound right is blasphemous downright
I astound mics, music is just what feelings sound like
So even though when I do it it's flames
For a while felt like I was makin' music in vain
We don't do it same, I use it for change
Y'all do it for change, I use it for pain
But keep doin' ya thang' Soundscan skyrocket
Build all this hype 'bout it, prayin' people might cop it
This is just my logic, maybe it's psychotic
Though labels try to stop it this is my antibiotic
So lemme' start doin' what dudes like
A nigga in the booth feelin' fresher than some new Nikes
Dawg, and I cruise like cruise control
Fuck that! I can't do it, I might lose my soul
Even though it should help a nigga to his goal
Would defeat the whole purpose
Naw, that ain't what Jers is
Naw, that would be worthless
Bars soundin' nervous
A nigga much deeper than what you see on the surface
I'd rather resort back to snatchin' purses
Finally understanding what the gift and the curse is
If I was more concerned about a purchase
I would tell y'all it's about to go down like bird shit
It takes courage, me versus urges
A wordsmith that got caught-up in label merges
And what's worse is, I been deserted in the circus
Up-and-left the circuit, it's dead like hearses
Sicker than them pedophiles workin' in them churches
That ain't the type shit I deem fit for my verses
Dawg, so lemme' help niggas understand Mouse
Dawg, why try to fit in when you a stand-out?
It's no album, but the money never ran out
Aside from rap, I'm kinda' focused on land now. (You know?)
Cause I don't know whurr' the game is
I know we jus' been attacked by a Hurricane Chris
Some niggas can't fathom what money and fame is
Or some niggas get it by usin' they stainless
Or some niggas get it, but they can't sustain it
Me? I'm regular Joe, I don't let it change shit",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-hiatus-lyrics
Make It Through The Night,All Love Lost,2015.0,"[Intro: Joe Budden + 
Marsha Ambrosius
 ]
This for all my real niggas out there that never got to see another day. All my niggas out there still in the struggle, still tryna make it out, this for y'all
If I can make it through the night

Another collar, another dollar
Life's short but we live it cause we gotta
Another day, another blessing for a scholar
School of Hard Knocks, just reppin' my alma mater
That was back when I ain't have shit
God on my shoulder with the Devil on the ad-libs
Had to think some decisions through
When times hard, who the fuck you gon' listen to?
Toilet by the bunk, put you in a different mood
Locked up, Thanksgiving eatin' prison food
Back on the ropes, won't see a nigga budge
No bail for a felon so you gotta see the judge
They used to call us all lost niggas
Had the same dreams to make it 'til we lost niggas
Some was married to the game, I divorced quicker
But I can't judge, one day I'll see the lord with you

I'm feeling like I have my fate on the line
Heading closer to the exit sign
If I can make it through the night
This game ain't ever been no friend of mine
I'm just tryna make most of my life, my life
If I can make it through the night
If I can make it through the night
If I can make it through the night

Yeah I'm just tryna make it (HA-HAAAAAAAAH)
Note from the marshall, you can't even borrow
And it's sad cause they comin' with the padlock tomorrow
And for you to blame the world, gotta blame yourself too
Cause everybody feel you but nobody can help you
Bad thought get in your head, then you loop it
Stress build up then you do somethin' stupid
Put a mountain in front of you, you just try to move it
Count on one hand the couple niggas you cool with
Either they ain't pickin' up or they ain't got it
You learn the hard way when your actions are idiotic
Product of your environment, and you're the product
Home invasions, niggas is gettin' tied up
This is goin' through your head while you're in the bullpen
Backed into the spot but you should've pulled in
First nigga move and you're on him
But you're really prayin' for a R&R in the morning

I'm feeling like I have my fate on the line
Heading closer to the exit sign
If I can make it through the night
This game ain't ever been no friend of mine
I'm just tryna make most of my life, my life
If I can make it through the night
If I can make it through the night

They say tomorrow ain't promised, most nights I ain't want it to be
Nah a nigga couldn't front it to me
Too many nights for dinner I just ate an uncomfortable sleep
Had to open up the oven for heat
I was a born loser, thoughts of a sinner
Only made it out cause I fought like a winner
Threats all my life, I'm good, was all talk though
Death around the corner, all you gotta do is walk slow
Land of the haves and have-nots
Gun tucked, better to have it than to not
Try to make it out but crabs are in the lot
That'll plot, so if you take a stab you'll get shot
Look, I'm just proof a couple niggas said a prayer for me
Wasn't fair for me, God had to bear with me
Nothin' to live for, didn't have a care with me
Suicidal, had my mama sheddin' tears for me
Cause my son might need me
Life is hard but dyin' is easy
I thank God every day that I awake
I avoid another funeral, a homi' or a wake
I escape from niggas that lived through it
Better days ahead, we just gotta get to it

I'm feeling like I have my fate on the line
Heading closer to the exit sign
If I can make it through the night
This game ain't ever been no friend of mine
I'm just tryna make most of my life, my life
If I can make it through the night
If I can make it through the night",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-make-it-through-the-night-lyrics
Trade It All,House Rules,2014.0,"[Intro: 

 & Joe Budden]
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
, okay
It's that knock, right here
Word up
Just got a couple questions for 'em
Okay
It go

Uh, here's something I'd like to know (Uh)
Would you trade it all? Would you put a price on your soul? (Answer that)
You more about the outcome or the income?
Would you give up your dreams to feel like you're living in one?
Faced with decisions, would you ignore intuition?
Trade in whatever drives you for keys to an ignition?
Or would you go on like your life fine?
It's funny how a moment'll change your lifetime
Yeah, would I be held as a villain
If I never helped with feelings? Change to sell a million?
Yeah, wonder what these fans'll say to me
Still'll garner some bravery, money never dictated me
'Cause my morals for cash just ain't a trade to me
Respect is important, niggas know not to play with me
It's not a void to fill, it's no vacancy
Take it all, there's no taking me, Joey
[Chorus: Emanny & 
Joe Budden
]
I’m amazed
They always said I wouldn’t be here
So much in my way (
Uh
)
I’ve seen it all through these years (
Uh
)
It’s been give and take (
Been give and take
)
They thought I’d break (
But
)
But to trade it all (
Uh
)
Is no trade at all, at all

The ultimate contradiction
What started as a hobby now an honest way of living
Which took me to a genius from a pompous with a vision
Could do a dramatisation on the drama I've been given
Everybody says that, mine was kind of different
So every composition just to calm my inner prison
Armed and on a mission, strapped and only armed with my confliction
Never phased me, my only armor is this thick skin
Daddy talent (What else?), mama wisdom (What else?)
Master of deceit, I cheated through the honor system
Quit my temporary job, earned more
Left school, learned more, rehab then burned more
Tales of B&E's, toast and extortion
How my son was almost an abortion, I've been close to a coffin
Wouldn't do over this rollercoaster
Know it played out like it was supposed ta
 ( Joe)
[Chorus: Emanny & 
Joe Budden

I’m amazed
They always said I wouldn’t be here
So much in my way
I’ve seen it all through these years
It’s been give and take (
Not at all

They thought I’d break (
Talk to 'em
)
But to trade it all (
Let me talk to 'em like this
)
Is no trade at all, at all (
It go
)

Look, was froze over the phone
Waiting for you to change your tone while I was smokin'
But that never happened like I was hopin' (Nah)
Waiting for you to laugh, at least tell me you was jokin'
But you just kept on with the conversation
I'm tryna be calm and patient while pacin' around the room
Thoughts in my head are varied, that's you, grandpa and Mike
It's very scary, is cancer hereditary, Dad?
We had our little issues after ""Momma Said""
Glad that's behind us so we can cherish the time that's there
I got faith, I know the Lord'll have a say
But you got a daughter on the way, what more do I gotta say?
You got twins to raise, they just beginning to age
Tell God with a hint of rage it was meant for you to stay
If I gotta explain what should be understood
Yo, I'd trade me for you if I could, we all good
[Chorus: Emanny & 
Joe Budden
]
I’m amazed
They always said I wouldn’t be here
So much in my way (
Word up
)
I’ve seen it all through these years (
I seen it all
)
It’s been give and take (
 uh
)
They thought I’d break (

)
But to trade it all
Is no trade at all, at all (
It go

I Gotta Ask,Rage & The Machine,2016.0,"Look, standing in the cypher rocking
To driving some of the hottest cars New Jersey's ever seen
To dropping some of the dopest mixtapes that you ever heard
And it's all courtesy of weed, a couple of Percs, and lean, baby
I wish you niggas that would owe me
Some bread'll come and drop it off (word)
I wish she start tongueing a girl, but she won't pop it off
Wish I knew you wasn't with the shit, so what you hopping for?
When pussy's thrown your way every nanosecond it's not an option y'all
Normally a sponge, but this some shit I just cannot absorb
Why y'all are dressed like Metro Boomin? I wish you would knock it off
Wish the best MC didn't mean who is more popular
But I just booked my next nine months, ready to lock in more

Money there's a lot to grab
Before we get to it there's a question that I gotta ask
Where's all my niggas with the rubber grips? (bust shots)
And if you with me mama, rub on ya tits (and what not)

I hear they thinkin' bout speakin' my name
Bet if they could I'm takin bets
Money on my hood, money on me, I'm good
Money on the wood, money on wishin' that money would
That's him against the wild life
And I got money on the woods, baby
Two bitches, three's company, how I half with her
This Hennessy don't do the trick, then watch the Jack trip her
I'm tryna' buy a compound, I need the pad bigger
That's seven bed rooms, eight and half baths, I figure
Bad strippers, and fraudulent hourglass figures
Got every bartender thinkin' she'll get a glass slipper
You see a line of bottles comin', guess who orderin' 'em
I'm pointin' at one, they all coming in
Every rapper in the world, my crew is slaughtering them
Put vegetables in your house, nobody walking again
What time you get off, I'm showing up there
Nine in one hand, .45 in the other, 'round quarter to ten

I mean, the money there's a lot to grab
Before we get to it there's a question that I gotta ask
Where's all my niggas with the rubber grips? (bust shots)
And if you with me mama, rub on ya tits (and what not)

How many MC's must get dissed?
In the great words of Buckshot, my answer's ""why the fuck not?""
Come to bars, I'm the same nigga that love to club hop
Don't be the guy to  get your entire team in a rough spot
We the OG, thorough niggas, huggin' the block
Way down to the crooked businessman thats fudgin' them docs
The early teams in the hoods out there fuckin' with cops
Know they fuck with us back now, especially if you black now

Uh, talk to 'em

Feet are tired and the pain shows
It's such a long way to go now, such a long way to go
Gotta be strong by myself now, such a long road
My soul's so cold, weak in all my bones
But I gotta work hard just to reach my goals
Such a long way to go, so many miles left but I'm here now, yeah

Yo, yo, please Lord somethin gotta give (dog)
They say for every negative, there's a positive (dog)
But I ain't positive, for every buck deposited (dog)
We still in the hood, livin like hostages and never mind colleges
School of Hard Knocks scholarship, dealin with politics
I would just sell success in the store, if I could bottle it
But, I ain't a millionaire, won't see me in Forbes son
Life is like a (Beach Chair), when you can afford one (oh!)
Ruger loaded, just in case the war come
Might as well, everything is comin to the forefront
Need a clear head just to think
And fuck a (Drink N My 2 Step) nigga, I'm two steps from a drink
The pressure either bust pipes or it make diamonds
No matter how high up the mountain, I stay climbin
Freedom I keep chancin (oh)
So if I fall like Beyonce, I just get back up and keep dancin

(Yo Mouse, talk to 'em)

Never been a goal that I couldn't reach (uh)
Never been a lesson I couldn't teach
I done been through the World and back
Fuck school, I got all the facts
All I do is stand tall (stand tall)
When they got my back against the wall
When it's game time, all we do is ball
My niggas'll be here in one call (one call), one call (one call)
When shit get heavy, all I do is pick up the phone
Ain't gotta go through nothin alone
When shit get heavy, all I do is pick up the phone
Ain't gotta walk through this World alone, if I'm on my own

Keep on standin on my own two feet
Everytime that I cry, when I sweat, when I bleeeeed
See nothin can stop me, no nothin except meeeee


Uh, let me talk to 'em real quick, la-look, look
I'm chasin after pies With bags under my eyes
You lookin at my representative mask, it's a disguise
And I don't do things like I used to
The past is the past (but I'm), I'm presently thinkin about the future
Certain niggas bettin I fall
I'm speed joggin through the quicksand, I'm jugglin three medicine balls
See I'm comin up, used to share a room with two cellmates
Now I tower over the Devil but this ain't ""Hell Date""
Long way to go, I see my feet gettin blisters
I dare 'em talk to me like Mike Richards
Or play Don Imus and think it's cool to disrespect our sisters
I guess we got a while 'fore they actually get the picture
I think about Virginia Tech, think about Katrina
Niggas that caught Sean Bell slippin with the nina
A day before the wedding, safety off the weapon
Though all these things play in my head, I keep steppin (oh!)

Going Through the Motions,UnKnown,2012.0,"Verse 1: Joe Budden
If the charge is goin through the motions
Then I gotta plead guilty
If the sentence don't do it
Then the speed of which should kill me
Was told my options in this game was either death or prison
But I registered enough cash to change the repetition
Unknown they still don't know what to make of me
Rather than attempt it's much easier to say ""Fuck me""
They fake love me, observed and they judge me
Falsely as a rapper in the body of a case study
In my world even sure bets are not certain
Cause you'll get the picture then find out its the cropped version
Everything froze when they ran on me with Glocks squirtin'
So if time waits for nobody I doubt your clock's workin'
I told them buckle up, they said the ride's over
I put myself in other shoes they called him bi-polar (TALK TO EM)
But that only discredits what I'm tryna do
And you'll figure that out the moment you stop tryin to
Chorus: Joe Budden
On everything I love, right hand on the Bible
A Koran, be on whatever religion you suscribe to
I'm going through the motions like a drive-by
Way too many rules in this bitch I won't abide by
Uhhh, on pace, never stagnant
Only give em a fraction, this is a re-enactment
Don't believe what you see we just actin'
Or am I just rehashin'?
Truthfully am I goin through the motions?
Or are they goin through me?
Verse 2: Joe Budden
Check it, I'm just goin through the motions, born alone, die alone
The result of playin angry birds on this iPhone
Buyin some shots with some vicodin pop
That have you tell old girl you love her when you just like her a lot
I'm askin, how you gon' move forward, how you handle the pain?
If you leave behind more than you ever stand to gain
Same type of bitches in a different disguise
If I wanted to constantly hear their yellin' I'd just listen to Plies
Focusin on my old hoes as a sure way to make a quick endeavor
Ain't got an X that wouldn't rather be a different letter
That's how I end up in the words war
Picture the shit they gave me and continue to blame me and say they deserve more
But whatever my issue, the fattest ass is like a cure to me
Comes with a career path that never seems pure to me
When they say they model I'm not thinkin its for jealousy and security, entitlement, possessiveness, obscurity
Just goin through the motions, could tell I been here
It's so routine to me you would think that it's sincere
Screamin out somebody help
Destiny made a mistake and gave my fate to somebody else
Still I'm walkin round, hat low, holier than now
Just cause hoes be on my dial and they know me up in Child's
Just goin through the motions, but I do it in an armored truck
That way when I crash instead of spazzin I'll be calm as fuck
Chorus: Joe Budden
Verse 3: Joe Budden
I'm goin' through the motions, least I'm doin' it sober
Can't tell if I'm goin' alone or bein' chauffeured
The drivers on no rest, with no destination
Can't tell if this the test or its the preparation
Here's a message to the haters tryna stampede
You wanna kill the kid, you'll need a plan B
Voices in my head soundin' louder than the banshee
Callin' me a character, this ain't sponsored by Stan Lee
Uhhh, a pitfall of being famous
Sometimes you need a minute alone to get reacquainted
Spent so much time complainin bout the hand I was dealt
I damn near forgot how the mansion felt
Forgot what led me hear, forgot my history
Forgot I was a addict, forgot what that did to me
Forgot to count the cards, forgot how to deal
I was goin through the motions and they all, became, real

Good Enough,Escape Route,2009.0,"Baby, nothing's ever good enough
Nothing's ever good enough
Hollywood, think he too good for us
Nigga's emo, he ain't in the hood enough
How bout he's just misunderstood to us
Vision is fine, I can still hear
So I pop one more till everything is unclear
'Cause nothin's ever good enough
I'm just lookin for something, good enough

Wonder where his mind is
If everyone's impression is wrong then maybe mine is
Jury's out but the verdict's in
Case ain't been heard, so how they murdering him?
I appear to be arrogant, that's what they instilled in me
Took it as a weakness when I showed 'em humility
Insensitive, don't waste time tryna tell me what emotions is
I'm emotionless
I can't explain it, it come from home
Make me uncomfortable and you gon' put me in a comfort zone
Double is me, feel what I feel and know what struggling be
Tryna get depression to suffer from me
When your head's cluttered with noise you get lost
Am I isolated by choice or by force?
Listen, the fuck y'all expect from me?
Already given y'all the best of me, but it seem like...

Nothing's ever good enough
Hollywood, think he too good for us
Nigga's emo, he ain't in the hood enough
How 'bout he's just misunderstood to us
Vision is fine, I can still hear
(So I) So I pop one more 'til everything is unclear
Cause, just one wasn't good enough
Crushin it in rum wasn't good enough
The baddest girl wouldn't be good enough
All the cash in the world ain't good enough
(Why?) 'Cause you can go your hardest for your fans
But like you they only human so they may not understand that
I used to always try to be good enough
And couldn't figure out why I wasn't good enough
So instead of bein good enough
I just wanna be better, than good enough

The fuck's going on around here?
Contriving and conforming is the norm around here
It's tension, speak up and violence gets mentioned
In a world where everybody gets by off silenced opinions
And so I cut the red tape and the politics
Know it's there, I'm just the only nigga to acknowledge it
Learn from the acts that came before you and retain a lawyer
They told me, ""Once you get the fame you get the paranoia""
They say that he a has-been, irrelevant
But every word I say niggas get hella bent
Tell you why I'm off of the charts or on the bottom of your bracket
I rap through the heart and some niggas lack it
So I get why I'm greeted with spite
Got nerve being the truth, life's fine with them believing a lie
Even I no longer know what to expect from me
But y'all have yet to see the best of me, still it seem like

Nothing's ever good enough
Hollywood, think he too good for us
Nigga's emo, he ain't in the hood enough
How 'bout he's just misunderstood to us
Vision is fine, I can still hear
(So I) So I pop one more 'til everything is unclear
Cause, just one wasn't good enough
Crushin it in rum wasn't good enough
The baddest girl wouldn't be good enough
All the cash in the world ain't good enough
(Why?) 'Cause you can go your hardest for your fans
But like you they only human so they may not understand that
I used to always try to be good enough
And couldn't figure out why I wasn't good enough
So instead of bein good enough
I just wanna be better, than good enough

Check it, I want it all, that's why I strive for it
Diss me and you normally hear a reply for it
But I'm starting my maturation
And ignore em, let em continue they masturbation
Say my actions don't match what I'm spitting
So I tell em mind they business and let me stray
They say that you becoming a walking contradiction
I tell 'em people change every day
I tell 'em I've been making my own decisions since a teen
Tell me who the fuck is y'all to intervene, here's a lesson
I'm good enough for me, a nigga seem to be perfection
Fifty grand, V.I.P., Queens and perfection
Far from a beginner, nigga ain't a white belt
Cry me a river, and I'll turn into Mike Phelps
I'm just giving y'all the best of me
And y'all just turn that into stress for me, and so it seem like

Nothing's ever good enough
Hollywood, think he too good for us
Nigga's emo, he ain't in the hood enough
How 'bout he's just misunderstood to us
Vision is fine, I can still hear
(So I) So I pop one more 'til everything is unclear

Dreams (Interlude),A Loose Quarter,2012,"In all actuality
To work this hard for a passion is worth more than a salary
And it pay off hopefully to make my monthly look annually
So until this is a reality, I dream...
(Verse 1: Trev Rich)
I dream my way through life
Can't remember if I was awake or asleep
I killed my doubters with kindness
And force-feed them to taste the defeat
They're like this nigga been through something
How he rap like he ain't 23
Cause in my mind I'm 9, Millie's
Every rhyme you gon brace for this heat
My city big but it's so small at the same damn time
Where, failure and success is treated like the same damn crime
They gon hate you either way
Either way give them something to talk about
They must be talkin about us
Beause nigga we the only thing that's worth talkin about
And they said we next and I said we now
Sayin why and I'm sayin how
Thinkin up a way to make a million
Every time I lay it down
And my son and daughter they gotta eat
And that's even if my stomach hurt
My girl throwing up every morning
Low key, I think she gon pop the third
I was going through it with just two
Now I'm thinking it's three for me
But on every last one of them
I swear to God we gon get this cheese
Dreaming since a youngin writing poetry to pass the time
Never give me shit nigga
So think twice for you ask for mine
It's Gucci, Louis, Prada shit
We all about to be taking flight
I give a fuck if you high right now
I'm about to put you on a different height
I swear to Ma' they gonna get me mine
Lampshade nigga, just let me shine
Most go through life and cry
Nigga, I go through life and grind
My heart and soul on every beat
Cause that's what real niggas gonna do
Some shit might seem small to ya'll
But somebody out there going through it
Used to battle niggas at lunch
And try to sneak my food in class
I was writing raps and they was passin notes
And I still passed on they stupid ass
18 with no worries
My, my, how fast my story change
Just for me, been where I was from
Most motherfuckers could've swore we bang
That G5 shit was epic, but before all that I was such a loner
Every nigga try to fuck with us
Every bitch wanted to fuck on us
I'm just speaking realistic
And reality is so vicious
But no, I'm not bragging about
Making your favorite girl a statistic
Nigga what you know about splittin poles?
What you know about eviction notes?
What you know about multiplayer on that Golden Eye on that 64?
What you know about Walkmans? CD players? Stereos?
What you know about smart girls?
I never really been into centerfolds
What you know about riding hot?
Getting bunked and you had to go?
What you know about fingerprints?
And waiting on your bail to post?
What you know about struggling?
And sharing money just to get a meal?
What you know about hitting licks?
It go bad and the shit get real!
What you know about taking losses?
Bouncing back in the same week!
Shit you might know about all these
But nigga, what you know bout me?
(Bridge)
I must've fell asleep on top of the world, yeah
Having fantasies and having threesomes with success and my favorite girl
Yeah
But we've been going through it since...
(Verse 2: Trev Rich)
And I'll be drinking out this bottle like I never gave a fuck
She said she into whatever I'm pouring in her cup
Looking over the city feeling like this is for us
If we sleep don't let housekeeping wake us up, wake us up
Because we've been dreaming
For too long
I swear we been dreaming
For too long
They could never alarm us
They could never harm us
We ain't gotta worry about 'em we'll leave it to karma
But I swear we been dreaming
Too long....",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-dreams-interlude-lyrics
Bullshit Rappers & Metaphors,Mood Muzik: The Worst of Joe Budden,2003,"Whoaaa....yeah, it's your boy Jumpoff Beezy a.k.a. Regular Joe a.k.a. That Dude
Shout out to all the mixtape DJs and shit
Stack, what up nigga
Webb, turn my vocals up a little bit
See, what we gonna do is we gonna rhyme like the other niggas and shit
With the bullshit rhymes, putting a whole bunch of words together just because
And niggas is really listening to that shit like, ""Yo, he's hot""......NOT
I think niggas might have forgot what the word ""hot"" is
Fucking with all these metaphor niggas with the bullshit like
""I'm flat like plasma""
""I smoke like forest fires"" and all this dumb shit
""I'm cool like AC's""
""I bang like bangers""...ha...some dumb shit
SO.....we gonna have to teach niggas how to rap again
Niggas might have forgot -- go ahead and help them out
We recording?...... ARE WE RECORDING???
All right -- just making sure, man
Its, its, its that on top music!!!

Ok, moving on now -- we done with the no names
Now put the purple in the air like soul plane
Point blank when hammers is out
I'll have it right up on your skin -- it's like the plastic on your grandma couch
In the hood somebody's telling, cops cuff and arresting
So its somebody else besides 
Usher confessing
Spray y'all clip team
Y'all broke but the day y'all get cream is the day y'all meet the AR-15
Jason Bourne niggas sent right after a guy
The dudes that say word to they seed right after they lie
So when I spot 'em or see 'em
I'mma play the graveyard realtor in charge of every mausoleum
Buying 900 gallons of dip
In the crib the living room wall is 900 gallons of fish
The block is fucked up, my son's feeling is helpless
I see why everybody in slum village is selfish..nigga

Hard to imagine the game without me
Even mixtapes just ain't been the same without me
And anytime beef is on or the heat is on
I'm on some Nelly shit in New Jerz, getting my Eagle on
Niggas wanna rep, better watch your back
Even little niggas is 
jumping
 now they 
Robert Pack
And there's great artists out the struggling to get a joint across
While wack niggas need nine minutues to get a point across
When will you cowards learn, though?
I only fuck chicks looking like they off the Howard Stern Show
I love when black youths do they numbers and all
Make hits to make them little kids run to the store
But its like rappers ain't got no hunger at all
And niggas' albums don't leave you with a hunger for more
Say Joe, leave it alone -- accept it, they lost
But I'm a addict -- got a problem with beating a dead horse, nigga

Simple, man...see...two way ya boy next time you drop, man
No more mixtapes hit the street without the kid on them
Thats how we gonna do, 
y'all must've forgot like Roy Jones
That's one of then wack metaphors niggas be using, too
Yo, 
I'm hot like the sun
I am cooler than the other......oh yeah,

Better Off Without You,UnKnown,UnKnown,"You was the one baby girl I never been so sure
Ya skin so pure, the type men go for
The type, they drive a Benz slow for
The type they be beepin the horn rollin down the windows for
BUT! had to break up, I had to leave you
It was some things you needed to learn that I couldn't teach you
And those words musta hurt
But if you can't trust me, how am I supposed to trust it'll work?
Like I can't teach you to stand right beside me
Or the priveleges that come with that title ""wifey""
It's highly unlikely, and I'm concerned myself
I can't teach you you that bitch, you gotta learn it yourself
And I can't teach you swagger, can't teach you attitude
Can't teach you to talk, its a problem get at your dude
We both got some things thats upsettin us
If you don't hear from me, know I'm somewhere reppin us
Problems lets squash it, its senseless
Dont wanna end up lovin ma from a distance
We goin do it like uuuggghhh

I don't ever wanna do this thing without you
But I'm starting to feel
That maybe I'll be better off without you baby
(no matter what we went through
See no matter what we went through, we gon' do it like...)

What about the months that I left, am I seein it right?
And is this really how she acts without me in her life?
How could you have that fag on top of you touchin you
Like only I used to
Like only I'm used to
And I'm tryna figure it out, and you can't help me
How you naked 'round duckboy, you can't tell me
Pictures still in my mind, of THIS nigga feelin ya behind
Am I supposed to still feel like it's mine?
ANd you tense when you by me
You in the shower cryin tryna rub his prints off yo' body
Cause you feel nasty, and thats sad to see
But if that got you feelin that bad then imagine me
Knowin I'm a step ahead of these cats
And you tryin to force yaself to love dude ma you better than that
Tryna force him on you cause I took a step back from us like ""chill""
THAT was for us to build
THAT was for us it's real
Lets squash it its senseless, don't wanna end up lovin ma from a distance
We goin do it like ugggghhh


Now you got some new men in ya life, some new friends in ya life
That you act different wit
But baby girl thats not the chic that I'm gettin wit
You not the same as you was, maybe cause ya life changed from what it was
Havin you around ballplayers, wines gettin finer
Now you eat sushi, no more diner
Now you at a bench, short skirts and eyeliner
You industry now, everything's designer
Things changed everythings designed to
But maybe that life's not you and I'm the only thing that reminds ya
Say you love me but did you call me no
So is it really really love or am I all that you know?
Cause you quick to tell a kid to never call you again
With that said how can I call you a friend or anything more?
How can I see us havin anything more
If its that easy what we go through anything for?
Or..problems lets squash it its senseless
Dont wanna end up lovin ma from a distance

Russian Roulette,UnKnown,UnKnown,"What niggas don't know and what my friends don't see
Is while the world keep spinning, its a lens on me
So I sit and prophecize of what the ends gon be
Maybe a domino effect if you depend on me
Now the cool thing to call me is a asshole, is that so
Pill popping in a strip club with my hat low
Out of every battle, I ain't lost yet
Say I'm misunderstood, I say my points just ain't come across yet
Prince, all I'm missing is the little red Corvette
Feeling like a million though a nigga ain't in Forbes yet
All that shit go with the fame
The industry's the wrong complexion, tryna Sammy Sosa the game
Sharper than y'all without a days rest, he don't mind being a pawn
Then how the fuck you gonna mind it when I play chess
No beef with Beans, not a beef with Fab
Just fags that think I'm searching for a beef to grab
I'm too talented to reach for that
It take more than some tweets in fact
To get him off the leash, capiche
And if streets is so concerned about me and Somaya Reece
But they ain't got the whole puzzle all they do is try to piece
Reality ain't World Star, lets keep in private please
Me and her gon end up whatever we decide to be
Can you hear me, tired of niggas asking 'bout Tahiry
She can do what she wanna long as she don't do it near me
Y'all reading MediaTakeout, what I take out the Media is
Everything ain't what it appear to be
Leaking pictures of Fif feeling on your ass
But if you seen it like me then you be feeling like an ass
So I'm thinking I was fooled by watching you act a fool
Seeming desperate for attention, baby, take this as a jewel
And since we no longer, you and Cotto get the same advice
Need to fire everybody in ya corner
Niggas ain't worth my time, I won't respond to ya
Momma called saying, ""Who you gon get to sponsor ya""
Fans becoming less fond of ya
What they've concluded looking at me through a monitor is that I should be monitored
Wait! let me apologize if I'm alarming ya
Dreaming 'bout nightmares, fell in love with my insomnia
Or is my presence to blame, I live in the future
Laughing at y'all, still waiting on the present to change
Say my life's like the Truman show
But if niggas could care less then what they tune in for
I give em all access while creating a new sound
And you bound to run into hurdles when you breaking new ground
Got Jersey on my back, there were few folk beg to differ
I do it all by myself, ain't gotta beg a nigga
They like I'm better than son
And he a bad look for Jers, but a bad look is better than none
You now dealing with a visionary
Dog ya style doggie style, I rather be on top, I favor missionary
Them wack niggas that you say in they prime
Ain't seeing numbers, they dealing with Renee Divine
I thought I was unprepared for the fame and all the bears
Then I went to see my grandma and it all became clear
Cause she 90 years old, can't move, blank stare
Like she waiting on death, won't move up out that same chair
Yeah, listen, I'm outspoken, outcasted
When the odds was outrageous, a nigga outlasted
Look at what you making a issue
Difference between leaving the hood and taking it with u
Is the difference between watching from home and sitting courtside
Difference is I'm one up, you thinking the scores tied
Unh, simple-minded motherfucka
So if I'm Anti its cause I mind it motherfucka
Bar for bar, if you looking for a lil' trauma
If I acknowledge yo ass, nigga its still a honor
A bad bitch by my side that cause a lil' drama
Thinking she can ""pop up"" on me cause she my Lil' Mama
Say I ain't the best, that man don't know me
Never ran, never will, fuck Dan Antoni
But I'm planning my escape once I get off tour
And just know it's gon' be on my terms, not yours",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-russian-roulette-lyrics

Came from the crack house, back room, black out
Smoke hit they lungs, make 'em UFC Tapout
No plan B, it was nothin' else to map out
So we throw stones while we livin' in this glass house (glass house)
It's been a minute so they ask where the fire went
My kitchen clean but I still got the pilot lit
Made a fortune out of fumes, my MacGyver shit
Reality TV before Survivor, bitch
Yuuuck, put our lives on display
Who's thinkin' about tomorrow? We ain't promised today
This rap game fickle, we ain't promised to play
The last of the greats, pay homage to me

Yo, if my past had an encore, it'd be like an onslaught
A lot of niggas died, there's too many to mourn for
I'm thinkin' about my youth, us as little kids, am I wrong for
Havin' thoughts Bishop Eddie would Long for?
I got decade old wounds, that'll still bleedin'
That chapter of my life's closed, that y'all still readin' (still readin')
Straight face on, pretendin' to feel decent
Casket shoppin' for a loved one that's still breathin' (still breathin')
Uh, swear that shit got in the way of summer
Avoidin' calendars, since all your days were numbered
Laid out in the bed, could barely sit up (uh)
Those were your last breathes, I was mistakin' for hiccups (oh!)
Y'all don't get the picture (uh), when your medicine is liquor (uh)
I'm talkin' phone ringin', bein' too afraid to pick up
I know you in a better place and that joy is felt
I learned when death calls, it won't leave a voicemail (nah)
You would be proud, I'm due to be caked up
Wanna make your dreams come true? Gotta wake up (gotta wake up)
You groupie niggas, I don't see how you deal with it
Broke and starvin' but clingin' to your meal ticket (meal ticket)
Broke hustlers that bake that trash
Back and forth to they vacant stash
Still in all I know a few that'll make that cash
Quick flip (uh), even Rex Ryan ain't lose the weight that fast
Y'all should treat me like royalty (royalty)
Last of a dyin' breed, that puts money and power behind loyalty (word)
Careful, that bitch shit'll rub off
Me, I'd rather die with my balls, than have to live with 'em cut off (cut off)
Long winded, be patient enough to hear 'em
I'll give you the jewels, if you brave enough to wear 'em
But know before you swallow it up

You niggas want war? Trust me you don't want war
Homeboy, you don't know how serious it could be
Man, the feeling starts, it's a million man march
No games, all my soldiers as serious as can be be
When we pull up like, hey ya, hey ya, hey ya, ho
Then we run up like, hey ya, hey ya, hey ya, ho

Man, y'all done gone and did it, well come on with it
The fifth got a kick, but won't slip, I rubber gripped it
Wrap you in them sheets on Christmas, I'm double-gifted
Double barrel shotty, you double jointed when you flippin'
Ask about your boy, they'll tell you I'm not the fella
Tomato sauce whoever tryna shred up my mozzarella
I guess it's in my genes, no prints if I got the poke out
Man, let these nigga's reach, I'm Iverson with the blow out
Sometimes you gotta show out, just to show 'em what Joe 'bout
Give 'em the green light, well fuck it, where we even goin' now?
Got shooters on the scanner, you never know what we spoke 'bout
Picture Tony Montana with hammers runnin' in Sos' house
Ghost Town
Bullets in the beach chair, lines drawn, break the sand
Got bad news, sit 'em down, nah, nigga take a stand
Dirty crackheads run up on you, ""What you was sayin', man?""
It's lights out, won't even take a bath, ha

When we pull up like, hey ya, hey ya, hey ya, ho
Then we run up like, hey ya, hey ya, hey ya, ho

You dick-faced ass nigga's asked for it so, here they come

No matter where they from I disappeared and dump
No choice but to swear they dumb, 
but we're not dumb
I'm on my Luke Skywalker, get your Jedi spun
I'm on my DMC, I hear them things rev, y'all run
Guess it's begun, get the private jet, pilot set
Alibi in check, to the island head, make sure it's no survivors left
'Round up all the hostages, bum stiggity bum, stiggity bum
Hey, I mean a lot of them, shit be soundin' like Das EFX
I pay no mind to the talkin' 'til it's a heightened threat
Never baby nigga's with envy to give me my respect
I eject bullets from rifles wearin' a sniper vest
Find your body OTC, you're like a Prilosec
Y'all won't even hear me comin', Michael Myers' steps
Hear that thing ch-ch-choppin' 'til no tires left
Bulldogs bark, 4s roars like a lion's breath
I love new toys, so I invest
[Chorus: Joell Ortiz & 
 Joe Budden
]
You niggas want war? Trust me you don't want war
Homeboy, you don't know how serious it could be
Man, the feeling starts, it's a million man march
No games, all my soldiers as serious as can be be
When we pull up like, hey ya, hey ya, hey ya, ho
Then we run up like, hey ya, hey ya, hey ya, ho",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-serious-lyrics
Forget,Rage & The Machine,2016.0,"It's easy, to forget
A joke or game, someone's name
The day to day, what time to meet
A certain place, or one street

Faces be looking familiar, sometimes it's hard to know
I've been in a whole lot of places, I've met a lot of folks
Ain't had a window to open, needed a pot to throw
In my hood the story of Mouse is one you gotta know
Could ask ma to push the i8 Beamer
Can't remember where I seen her, I think it was La Marina
Singing all the words to Trina
Whole demeanor said freak like old pictures of Adina
But now all these broads shaped the same and waist trained
I'm on my third passport, I can't remember these niggas
Like all the faces is blurred of most these industry niggas
Mean game somewhile for an inkling of the fame
And I can spot them from their accents when I'm thinking of their name
I've seen dames sip pink champagne
And do drugs that'll put Charlie Sheen to shame
Off my penis until I came
The drugs over these years made its way to my mental
Pardon if I don't remember when you gave me a demo
Or that one night we met up in Aces
When it count 'em an accountant, I'm just better with faces
So it's regular Joe, a regular wherever if I'ma go
That's since forever ago, so it's however it could go, Joey",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-forget-lyrics
I Couldn’t Help It,Padded Room,2009.0,"(Talk to em) We had a beautiful relationship at one point (but then)
Then that shit changed with the quickness
Maybe because I was fucking other bitches (or)
Or maybe we had no business having business
Not the girl that I would want to raise kids with
But still that shit happen regardless (look)
I was so young back then so heartless
The shit I was thinking could have caught me some charges
Listen, I tried to talk to her normally (but)
That shit didn't work for a one second she was on to me
I tried to explain how I ain't have a dollar to my name
Pursuing this rap shit chasing fame
Young dude stressed in the hood
Like Jesus
I ain't ready for no child but she was
When you piss poor
Get to having sick thoughts
While the chick probably sitting there thinking about marriage
I'm thinking abortion like a savage
An on purpose accident to have a miscarriage
Her mother and mine I couldn't end up seeing (plus)
Plus what type of mother would you end up being
You already a psycho I went and let that pass
I ain't think life time bond I thought fat ass
All them times you was pregnant and miserable
All them fights we had that got physical
Every time I sent you packing, pissed at you
Like I ain't want to live with you
Yeah I kinda planned that
Inconsiderate
That sounds just like me
(Then you) Then out pushed something out that looks just like me
I grabbed my little dude up
Looked him in his eyes
You can't understand right now I apologize
How could I not want you here and be that selfish
Fuck was on my mind at the time my bad I couldn't help it

Naw mean I couldn't help it
(Talk to em right quick)
For real I couldn't help it
Even though I tried
Must have been something going on inside
No lie I couldn't help it
I couldn't help it

(Talk to em) Now this is how you know we go threw phases
(How) Cause he done sold millions of records
(And then) Plus they done been together for ages
I don't really know how I should say this
Me and ole boy done shared a couple of stages
But he wasn't around when I saw her in Vegas (ok)
She said remember me
I though I shouldn't lie
I looked baby up and down and said should I
Maybe she my ole broad maybe she a singer
I looked down and seen that chunky rock on her finger
She said I'm blinks wife how you been and what your doing here
(Look) I should have asked her that same shit
(Cause) Snoop already told me that bitches ain't shit
And the industry's so small
That's how the game is
When you famous
Everybody's a bilingual plaintiff
And the defendant speaks one language
But we exchanged numbers like fuck it (I mean look)
All we gone talk about is music (And then)
Neither one of us will ever use it (I was wrong)
Shorty she ain't hesitate to use it
Four A.M. where do I began
She's leaving the club I'm up at the Wynn
She's so aggressive like what room are you in
I ain't answer she said meet her downstairs in ten
So now we totally disrespecting his star
I'm with his bitch
She in his car she said hop in let's head to the strip bar
Bad ass friend with her (den she turned around and) and then she kiss ma
And now I'm so confused
She start telling me bout how she's so abused
How he beats her as how he takes that figure
And in my head I'm thinking about how I don't blame that nigga
We hit the club like everything is wonderful
She's touching me I'm feeling uncomfortable
And then the D.J. threw on something slow
I'm grinding on her friend now she wanting to go
Dude wife start whispering in my ear
I'm starting to see it clear she don't care
Shorty down with whatever
She said let's go to your room all together (and I'm)
I'm sure the two of us will make it worth your while
Now your friend looks great and I really want to fuck her
But I can't be your side dude can't be your lover
Called on my old school trick just to duck her
We got to the room told her I ain't have a rubber
I thought it worked at first (but)
One look disappointed and one looked hurt
But her trifling ass when and made shit worse
She reached down and pulled a few of those from her purse (bioch)
Got on her knees started playing with the head
All her dude's lyrics started playing in my head
Her friend jumps in probable feeling left out
I'm filled with guilt cause all I could think bout was
He has her on T.V. with your kids
I got her on the T.V. in her ribs
Please god forgive
Regret what I did
That ain't the life style I wanna live
Just then I couldn't help it
Ta ha, Ta ha, Ta ha
Naw
I couldn't help it
Mic, ma mic
I couldn't help it
Even though I tried
Must have been something going on inside
No lie I couldn't help it
I couldn't help it
Naw I couldn't help it

If I Die Tomorrow,Mood Muzik 2: Can It Get Any Worse?,2005,"Y'all in that mood yet?! (in that mood yet)
Y'all in that mood yet?!?! (in that mood yet)
If I died tomorrow
See if I died tomorrow
Yo, yo yo yo yo
I woke up around nine, day felt like no other
Kissed wifey on the forehead, told her that I love her
Thinking as I look for where my car keys at
I know it ain't promised I'll be back
See if I died tomorrow
Whether from a disease or from a bullet
I wouldn't be mad, I lived my life to the fullest
I drove cars that I never thought I would
I fucked broads never thought I could
See if I died tomorrow
I'd be in heaven with the folk that raised me
Grandma, Jimmy, Great Grandma Daisy
'Least I'd be around some people that's just like me
'Least I'd be around my Uncle Mikey
If I died tomorrow
I know moms would probably be hysterical
For 25 years she seen me be a miracle
Seen me come a long way just by being lyrical
Naw I ain't act religious but God know me to be spiritual
If I died tomorrow, wouldn't feel like it's wrong
I ain't expect to be here this long
They told me before I get 21 that they would have my
Grave handy
Two years later, nominated for a Grammy
Vibe Awards, Kev said I probably shouldn't go with him
He ain't think I wouldn't make it good at the podium
Fans wanting the best for me
I couldn't be there as I won but Treach all my Jersey
Heads rep for me
If I died tomorrow then what would it mean
Already feel like I'm livin my dream
Came across some pretty interesting folk
I met some new people
Ain't move alot of units, but touched a few people
So I might get frustrated fuckin wit the hood son
But everyday above ground is a good one
Walk out the door and leave it in God's hands
If I go it's just part of God's plan
If I died tomorrow
Will life carry out the same
Well at least my little man can carry out the name
And look, I can say I lived my life without stress
If I died tomorrow, I'm fine I been blessed, Yes!
I made some money, and true I could've had more
But he's happy and what more could he ask for
If it was no diamonds and no begets
I still would have no worries, I got no regrets
I made my mom proud, and pop feels the same way
But he's a man so he probably got too much pride to say
Can't count my blessings on one hand, more than a handful
And God ain't send nothin my way I couldn't handle

If I know I was called to go
I know one thing that's for sure
I'll be alllriiight.. cuz it was my time
And if its one thing that I know
I don't regret one choice I chose
I'm livin my life
If I was gonna die tomorrow

Yo if I died tomorrow
Throw a little liquor in the sky
I'm good here don't ask God why, don't cry
I did everything I wanted, left nothin unturned
Roll sumtin, light it, let it burn
If I died tomorrow...
Naw I don't wanna die tomorrow.. said I DON'T WANNA
DIE TOMORROW
Well just in case, remember my ways, remember my face
For all that remember my place
I love me
Best thing about dying tomorrow I won't see anybody I love leave
So if the Lord take me, don't re-incarnate me
I don't wanna come back, and please DON'T MAKE ME
Don't cry, just wave goodbye
Let all my songs rock, smile at me in the sky
Don't pour liquor, I'll save niggas some Hennessey
Just play a spades game, slame a card in my memory I speak my mind
I roll a blunt with God, know he smoke sumtin better than any weed you can find
So pass that Jesus
You gotta get high to think of all these diseases that
Put us right where he is
Damn I'mma miss my mans, miss my chick, miss my fam
Miss my fans
The world is like jail, this is like Debang
So now take it all back, I won't miss a thing
I'm feelin pretty wise
And death I can take off this disguise
When it come just let it be a surprise
I'd rather it quickly
I may not be remembered as the best, that's cool, long as y'all don't forget me
Now who the fuck you think is living to this day
I try to tell my young niggas crime don't pay
So I hope Ma Dukes can understand where I was
And hope Trey can be a better man than I was
I don't wanna live to be 80
Life's a cycle
The older you get, more you live like a baby
You could barely move, folk gotta be there for you
Diapers on, niggas gotta take care of you
Learn shit all over again
Skin wrinkled, ya memory gone, and you a memory gone
'Least in '03 I made a few folk dance
I wanna thank Def Jam cuz they gave me a chance
Wanna thank my street niggas
The show me the streets niggas
When it's your turn I'm at the pearly gates to greet niggas
When it was beef niggas
Snatch the heat niggas
Said 'Mouse you a star give that back to me' niggas
My nigga Big Perm, fuck being a hype man
Since Lincoln High School my nigga been my right hand
Dude MK already know that I love him
You like a third brother, you past being a cousin
The mother of my baby for giving me my baby
Naw, I won't trash you, you been aight lately
Heights, Still, and Du, can't forget Dub B
Held me down when I ain't know how to love me
I mean back in the days I felt so ugly
I can't say why, bitches always dug me
A lightskinned nigga, always kept a fresh line
My feelings like wine, just got better with time
So if I die tomorrow, and y'all choose to ignore him
Just say he repped Jers' like nobody before him
Look, I can say I lived my life without stress
If I died tomorrow, I'm fine, I been blessed, Yes!
If I died tomorrow, I'm fine, I been blessed, Yes!",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-if-i-die-tomorrow-lyrics
Find a Way (Whatever It Takes),Mood Muzik: The Worst of Joe Budden,2003,"It's ya muh'fuckin' boy (Yeah)
""Jump Off"" Joe Budden here
Clinton Sparks we gon' get familiar with it
We gon' get familiar together, matter fact, Boston stand up
Jers' stand up
Sparks, holla at ya boy
It's, it's, it's
It's that 
On Top music
!

Whatever it takes to find a way (Oh, oh)
To find a way, to find a way (Oh)
I'ma do whatever it takes to find a way (You know)
To find a way, to find a way
I'ma do whatever it takes to find a way ( fire)
To find a way, to find a way ( I got the soul of a fighter)
Whatever it takes to find a way (Walk barefoot over the coal over fire)
To find a way, to find a way

All right
I'm dealin' with some shit, homie, it's in the back of my head
And it's some shit, homie, but I just rap it instead
See I got Wolverine's bones in me, but the whole world's throwin' stones at me
Like they all got a bone with me
Got a child's mother, and I hate her to death
But that's my child's mother, so that's my mate to the death
It's wild how I love her (For) for puttin' little me here
And me and her can beef forever, she gon' still be there
Then there's some other niggas, I judged their character wrong
But they some other niggas, now let's get back to the song
I got a drug problem that I ain't tended to
Because I got enough problems, and my solution is to stuff problems
But if something goes wrong with that
Then it's back to PCP and so long with rap
See I'm depressed lately, but nobody understands
That I'm depressed lately, I'm sorta feelin' repressed lately
So y'all been hearin' and seein' me less lately
Like 'has anyone noticed the regress lately?'
Look deep, nigga, don't I seem stressed lately?
Seem disturbed, lot of regrets lately
Got a company that I'm signed to
But they ain't in my company when all I need is some company
When I start feelin' like e'rybody's done with me
They're tryna see what e'rybody want with me
Then the mistress, yeah, the girl from ""10 Minutes,"" it's her
Now I'm needin' 10 minutes from her
I can't get into it, but I want y'all to know
That I'll get into it
, 
but I'll save that for 
The Growth
And there's rap beef, but I'm so secure with me
It's only rap beef, I don't need security (Never)
Wanna get at me? Wanna go to war with me?
That's just one phone call for me, check the shit
I got a whole hood (That what?) that don't appreciate me
But it's not the whole hood that depreciates me (Okay)
What you gon' tell me when it's the streets that made me?
And I won't let the belly of the beast degrade me
And they just crap critics, they say all I make is dance music
But to almost anything you can dance, stupid
They ain't like the single (Nah), so they ain't copped the album
Wouldn't give a chance to it, not a second glance to it (Nah)
They say he whines too much (And) he's too bitter (And)
They call it complainin', (But) I call it explainin' (Y'know)
How normal niggas could get caught up in the game and
Lose they mind and y'all call it entertainment
There's some shit with me, but dudes been knew that
But I'm gamblin' a lot and I ain't used to do that (I didn't, nah)
Rap ain't payin' the bills, it's mo' money mo' problems
Or it's no money mo' problems
All enormous when you play at these stakes
That's how it feel to have a warrant on a famous face
Then the album pushed back, 'cause they say he need a single
At the moment, but what he needs is a single moment
Then I'm involved in the he say, she say
(That's) In my mind on replay, each day
(Then) Then it's the bullshit that she say he's gay
'Cause she wouldn't like to think that he ain't like her
Just 'cause she was throwin' it at me and I ain't touch her
She'll say anything 'side from I ain't wanna fuck her (Nah)
I don't feel good, so I don't wanna go to a club
Don't wanna go to a lounge, just wanna lounge (I just wanna lounge)
In the same sweats that I had on for days
Same tee I had on for a week, what I got on it speaks
What I got on, it reeks
No shape up, chillin', 'cause that's just how I'm feelin'
And one day at a time, it's God willin'
(See I'm) Tryna see straight but the fog keeps buildin'
Pulse start racin', the bulls startin' to hate me
But I gotta be a king, 'cause there's wolves tryna play me
Hoodie when it's hot like it's freezin' winter
Rap star, eating sleep for dinner (You know)
And it's hard tryna keep this in ya (Why?), so I write it all down (Why?)
So one day maybe when life is all sweet I remember
Then it's probation, I know we all go through it
We call it probation, but there's no pro to it
Yeah, my soul's achin', only a few peers know
Funny thing about the case is it's a few years old
Had some shit going on with my *cough* (Woah) that felt good, but it's bad
So I'm sittin' here like, ""What the bitch had""
It's not rap it's real, look scrappy, it's true
Go on whatspoppin, do he (I) look happy to you? (Nah)
Now if it goes to the wire, go the soul of a fighter
Bruised up and sloppy, or damaged like Ali
Up late talkin' to the fans on a website
That's the only thing that send your man off to bed right
Fuck the world, fuck my moms and my girl!
Well maybe not mom, just let me remain calm
This too won't last, this too shall pass
At least that's what I say y'all, that's what I pray for
And I'm the only thing that's standin' in my way y'all
But I gotta be with me, there's no escape y'all
I guess depression just stepped in
And took over shit like it's known to do
Guess it said, ""Hey Joe, I'm goin' home with you
Turn your phone off, I need to be alone with you
I need to be in the zone with you
'Cause I'm the only thing you're prone to, nigga, look, I own you, nigga
Been with you since 10, but you startin' to confuse me
'Cause it's been so long and you still tryna lose me
Like, how could you show me such cruelty
When everybody turns their back on you, Joe? It's you and me (Us two)
Joe, you don't want me to see you, right?
Then why you always come get me, how we reunite, huh?
I know you feel for me deep in your heart
Doctors, meetings, pills couldn't keep us apart
But now you got a deal and you wanna get rid of me
We roommates, I'm in your head, Joe, you live with me""
So I don't write for the fans, nah, I write to my man
In hopes that he'll just leave and understand
Like, like please leave the kid in peace
Let me smoke this one cig' in peace (Just give me 10 minutes)
Just leave for a second, man, it's been too long and I can't troop it
And long as you around I can't make that dance music

Whatever it takes to find a way (Oh)
To find a way, to find a way (Oh, oh)
I'ma do whatever it takes to find a way
To find a way, to find a way (You're now listening to the Growth!)
I'ma do whatever it takes to find a way
To find a way, to find a way
Whatever it takes to find a way
To find a way, to find a way",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-find-a-way-whatever-it-takes-lyrics
Now Or Never,A Loose Quarter,2012,"Racing time, it’s now or never
Here we are, here forever
(You can eat our dust, we’re playing ring around the world)

Nah, this ain’t the story of a soldier
It’s the story of a nigga they counted as being over
It’s just the story of Joseph
A new birth, so if you counted me out
On one hand you understand me but still you had one hand free
I used to do this to feed my son and my family
Now you need those other 5 fingers, they might come in handy
Sprinkle your weed on your blunts
Got haters breaking world records for the most words eaten at once
Just getting out of my self's way, been a sucker to slavery
Fucked fear without a condom, had a baby named Bravery
Old head said, give' em murder on the beats
And fuck going commercial, make commercial go me
If it’s a hurdle I’mma leap, niggas ain't threats anyway
Odds ain’t in my favor, but I’m taking bets anyway
Wasn't with me in the gym in Jersey, lost his team
But none of my shots touched the Nets anyway


Remember him, Jerz kid, new to some, old face
Fans matured, so did I, now my words, hold weight
Nerve of them doubting I, probably had no faith
Figured I’d be rapper after the fact that we’re soul mates
Long ago I done been enlightening to y'all
But they was getting fresh air when the writing was on the wall
Was fucked up a while, smoking 2 packs a day
But never mind that, rather talk about some accolades
Got rich twice, he got clean twice
Put hood bitches on covers of magazines twice
When they say it’s play favorites, shit don’t seem right
And my fans looking confused like, ""fuck you mean he ain’t nice?""
I've stared death in the eyes without shades on
Blink once, open my eyes and they was gone
Ignore the chatter and my crabs in the bucket turned to lobster on the platter
None of you niggas matter


This here is the victory lap and yet I ain’t even win
Where do I begin? How bout when they wouldn’t let me in?
Won’t address that setback, passed that shit
I got the blackball and behind the back passed that shit
Concerned with getting my pay up
Some never thought he’d be hot, figured I’d just lay up
But I don’t take the easy shot, from the grimiest Tabernacle
My peers can respect this bad apple


Never thought we'd be back here right?
Never thought we'd be back, hold up
Let my guitars ride out
Just a moody motherfucker
That MME shit, we on it
If by chance I’m past my prime I’m tryna lap it",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-now-or-never-lyrics

Okay, yeah, normal baller
We back on tizzy, on top
Jump Off, Dub B, Jersey
Stand up
GO!

Jump off you rap guys is a joke
I'm here to take the scoring title without the green light from my coach
Man, don't make me have to smack your lineup
I'm Michael Jordan y'all Harold Minor's that rap vagina
All black ski mask, gloves, tuck the thing
Drive slow, lights out like ""I love this game""
I live this y'all paint that pic
And like Magic I'm starting to believe y'all dudes ain't that sick
Might see ya boy scooping up a bird to get knowledge
Number one draft pick and I skipped college
Snakes in the trenches I peep those, get injured
End up like Grant Hill on the bench in your street clothes
Talk about he real, how he quick with a Glock
But like Kurt Thomas he ain't good for shit on the block
See the gleam from the shoes
Man, I don't mean to seem rude
Gunshots do you like Vancouver make your team move
(Let's Go!)
Chorus:
It's gone be the NBA never NBC (Yeah)
Rookie of the year slash MVP (Rap suckas, we back)
Never channel 4
We handle the 4
It's the number one draft pick (Yours truly)
Let your gat spit, nigga
(Repeat)
Can't treat me like a sucka
Gather up your five, man meet me at the Rucker
Put the heat to you fuckers
Half Man-Half Amazing with a clip in my boot
My 4-5 will make you ""Skip To My Lou"", think about it
Understand when I was younger I was all on my own
So when I said 3-2 I wasn't calling a zone
Nice truck, nice house and chain
I car jacked you like Shaq shooting a three man get outta your Range
This is regular hood shit
I put Don Cheaney under the arm and show him how to make a good nick
If you wack, you need to probably write
Either that or quit it, throw in the chair like you Bobby Knight
I work damn hard
But don't think I can't rob
Can't pitch, I still handle the rock like Shammgod
Still hurt you cowards
Still see me merking them Prowlers
And know they still call me Dirk in Dallas
I'm that nigga
(Chorus)
Man I kill lame queers
It still ain't clear
Never saving the tech like Bill Laimbeer
I got tools for rilly
With shells that make your temple hot and I ain't talking 'bout a school in Philly
I ain't a selfish player
Man, I help your weight up
Cuz only Riders in this game now is myself and Isaiah
Listen, you gettin dissed
While I'm screwing these miss's
I'm on cruise control you still moving your pivot
But I'll show you how mean this crook be
You and your dogs' like the Houston Comets, a team fulla pussy's
Creep
It ain't a game no more, it's a sport
If you ain't got heart to play then stay off the court

Take it as my success throwing shots at me (Talk 2 Em!)
Gotta calm the lions, tame shooters
Gotta catch a new body with the same ruger
We don't spit the same mucas (Naw!)
I'm a boss and you not, shit they even tried to kill Frank Lucas (Talk 2 Em!)
So nigga if I die tomorrow, you ain't gotta ask why tomorrow
Dog I done con the likes of niggas
You should neva' con with
Made bonds with niggas you shouldn't bond with (Talk 2 Em!)
Im sick, world in my palm shit re-peated convict
While the dogs trying to con Vick, shit
I guess what im tryin say, is niggas die running like Ryan Shay (Talk 2 Em!)
All the Lean Me niggas, got high hopes call them Dream Team niggas
Shit is in my blood its a keen gene nigga
I make you appear to be whatever I feel like Green Screen niggas (Talk 2 Em!)
So go and get suped off words, maybe do it for Jerz
Maybe dudes disturbed (Talk 2 Em!), maybe dudes no go, maybe dudes bezerked
So when I pull up in a tank, maybe you deserve (Me!) (Talk 2 Em!)
I get into dudes character defects, before your deal you was a character reject
Humble pie when you see a character regress
Fuck ya tape homie, I pass it up, eject (Talk 2 Em!)
Time to seperate the real from the lies
The hills have eyes, but when the hill of ya demise
I reveal at the skies in a hot Ferrari
Its a new Joe in town and its not Girardi (Talk 2 Em!)
Look, turn pink her face getting her Cam on
In the club man on, freak gettin her jam on
Hands on trying to put her hands on the ice
Cause its Saw part 4 dog, big enough to stand on (Talk 2 Em!)
When did rappers start acting this fly?
Say you top 5, they'll grab it and ride, but I'm humble
So even though I Am Legend, I can say Will Smith's the best rapper alive (Talk 2 Em!)
When they tell you, your doing ya thing
They taking your tampon out and pulling the string
How the fuck you a thug when you stay shook nigga?
More like a school boy, a facebook nigga (Talk 2 Em!)
Im just straving this can't be greed
Im not a drug lord, don't nobody hand me keys
Gotta drop a few branches off my family tree
Raised my sons all wrong, yes I'm Andy Reid it's me (Talk 2 Em!)
I can't put the jewels on without no chrome
I can't rock these Ice Cream's without the Cold Stone's
Im so focused, get on some long nose shit
And ill have the goons surround you on some Rose shit (Talk 2 Em!)
The more I get into, streets or instrumentals
Bum ass niggas remind me of Mr. Wendal
Me, on the horizen, I've been trying to bring pies in
More dudes then Verizon behind them (Talk 2 Em!)
Bunch of generals behind me, Im the crew chief
Busting off my Ricky Davis, thats the new Heat
Ive come clean about me and its a damn shame
Only Religions im into is a brand name (Talk 2 Em!)
Campaign going full thortal like a race
Feeling Funkdafied get a bottle to the face
Face, for you times is rough too (WHY?)
Cause ain't nobody buying ya albums but you (Talk 2 Em!)
From the sounds of everything I hear you lost it
Still rap aight, but ya peers exhausted
Fuck ya bunch of money, put ya ego to the side
And maybe its time to study ya understudy (Talk 2 Em!)
I mean, are we hustling or are we grown up?
Everytime I hear you, you changing ya tone up
When the new generation think about Jordan
All they remember is when Iverson crossed him (Talk 2 Em!)
Take off the blazer, loosen up the tie
Nigga fell in love and Superman died
Better learn to cover ya ears when the toys pop
I hate ya last single (pause) Boys Roc
Can we hear some new niggas with promise?
The new generation won't forget you we promise
We'll always pay homage
But let's get one thing understood son
Every Encore ain't a good one! (Talk 2 Em!)",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-talk-2-em-lyrics
Angel in My life,Padded Room,2009.0,"B: Hello
Mike: Ayo b what's hood yo
B: What's going on mike
Mike: Aye I've been trying to get in touch with mouse, you spoke to him lately
B: What you mean I spoke to him you ain't hear
Mike: Naw
B: Nigga got dragged out his house in a fucking straight jacket
Mike: For what
B: Cause he talking about killing himself and taking people with him
Mike: You lying
B: Then they found mad drugs in his system man this nigga's gone he's lost yo

Let look behind the Swarovski crystals
Behind the 50 calibers and the pistols
Misuse pardon self gotta excuse my issues
For me just to have them a ritual
But I ain't as crazy as I seem to be
It's just that nothing is the way that is seems to me
I'm feeling less than drugging him up with anti-depressants
In essence I'm threatening my character assessment
Truth told, I figure a few hoes mixed with some new clothes
Should cover my loop holes
If I'm misunderstood or misguided
Started when they passed the L, said, ""Just try it""
When I don't want to get out of bed I just fight it
Sometimes I don't eat for days I just diet
Only live once so if I just like it
I ain't even checking the price I just buy shit
I'm thinking that will just hide it
But all it takes is life to ignite shit
Thinking bout death wondering how I'm gone go
I can't be insane for just wanting to know
In my head I die often, I use to think of suicide often
Good suit on and a nice coffin
But that ain't something I would try myself
Still they locked me in this room all by myself
I need a, I think I need a...

Mike: I can't even believe this shit you saying right now
Yo that don't even sound like mouse
B: just like we was at the club the other night
This nigga ran out the club start shooting my man up
Mike: word!!!
B: For no reason then this nigga talking about he's the only one who can save him
The apocalypse is coming and he's the savior of all mankind
Mike: that's crazy
B: that nigga ain't his self no more

They say my symptoms are aggressive
They title me a compulsive obsessive slash manic depressive
They tryna tell me that I'm a con and I game niggas
That's one reason I don't even entertain niggas
Not important who they are I won't name niggas
They like to say I have a tendency to blame niggas
I keep fucking shit up but keep trying
If ya'll would just trust me I wouldn't just keep lying
If I had bread I wouldn't be in debt
Let me clarify get in-depth
I feel like every time I been less, whenever I invest
Whenever I am set, I feel like I'm inept
I try to make 'em understand but they just won't 
I'm telling 4 million other I am the template
There ain't a book that tells a story there is no index
We got some different type of cuts and no there not princess
All this indigest seemingly endless
How I take in stress when I always went best
Aching in my chest yet and still it won't break me
They say the room's padded for my own safety
But the cushion don't soften shit
They locked the door but still they let my thoughts in it
And no one can tell me why I'm here
I can't even see the sky from here
, I guess my time is near

Mike: ayo we really need to go see that nigga yo
B: hum... I don't know we could do that but last time I saw him
He wasn't looking good they had him in the room
I.V.'s all in his arm looking like he was in a daze like his body was there
Mike: you spoke to him
B: Mentally he was gone they wouldn't let me near him
They had a guard by him on 24 hour watch
Had all these prescriptions he was taking
Mike: damn yo that's ain't even him
B: I don't know what's going on with that nigga
I just gotta keep him in my prays hope everythings good",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-angel-in-my-life-lyrics

Mami - dude you love dick, caress and rub dick
Love street niggas, love a thug dick
But you don't look like you gettin enough dick
But do you fuck in public and suck dick
Are you down with a dick, clown niggas dicks
When they put it in do you drown niggas dicks
Profound a nigga dick, and when you go down
I hope you don't kiss all around a nigga dick
You gettin lame dick, all the same dick
Clowns who can't fuck, new to the game dick
Scared of a freak with a hall of fame dick
So keep fuckin your ex-man who can't quit
You need stronger dick, fuck seven inches
Get a longer dick, put it on the dick
A champion dick, a heavyweight dick
Have you 2-way a nigga every day dick

My Cris' and Mo' bitches - that ride it well
My strip show bitches - hope you ride it well
We can fuck in the house or in the car
But tell me can you ride dick like a porno star
My gin & juice bitches - that take it well
My in school bitches - cause you takin it well
We can fuck in the house or in the car
But tell me can you take dick like a porno star

A nigga need pussy, soft and sweet pussy
If your shit's tight, then I'll probably eat pussy
I'm a picky dude, don't need beat pussy
Strictly freak pussy, just to leak pussy
I need fine pussy, need dime pussy
Need rare pussy that hard to find pussy
Got a one-shot, I need all the time pussy
Up echelon, top of the line pussy
Need tight pussy, get right pussy
No sleep, break day, all night pussy
Fuck whack pussy, I'm lookin for that pussy
Bitch you cheated on me but I'm right back pussy
Pop lock pussy, stop drop pussy
Let me lay up when the block hot pussy
Never before pussy, straight raw pussy
Fucked ten times but I want more pussy


Look I love sex, kind of rough sex
Whip cream, honey out, handcuff sex
Never without sex, all about sex
Hard backshots, pillow in her mouth sex
Deep stroke sex, deep throat sex
Run around here like you don't need no sex
All day sex, it's foreplay sex
Your back on the wall in the hallway sex
Make me wait sex, third date sex
Just finished arguin, havin hate sex
Relaxed sex, missionary sex
Nails in my back sex, now that's sex
No hands sex, advanced sex
Why you come to my crib wearin pants sex
Unlikely sex, try me sex
You gon' fuck around and be wifey sex",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-porno-star-lyrics
Blood on the Wall,Padded Room,2009.0,"Whoo! (Uhh, welcome) Ohhh!
I'd like to welcome everybody, welcome everybody (yo y-yo yo yo)
To the motherfucking Padded Room (yo, y-yo, yo)

How many niggas fell victim to the streets
Rest in peace young nigga, it's a heaven for a G
I'd be a liar if I told you that I never thought of death
My nigga, we the last ones left (l-look) l-look (l-look)
I said - how many niggas fell victim to the streets
Rest in peace young nigga, it's a heaven for
It'd be a lie if I told you that I never thought of death (l-look look)
My nigga, we the last ones left; but life goes on
And I ain't gon' stop 'til a nigga see blood on the wall!
L-look, look, look, look
Maybe it started with the rims on the whip
Uh, I lost the Hummer, push the Benz through the strip
But I'll swim with the fish before I lend niggas shit
Cause personally, they ain't worth the phlegm that I spit
That's why, sometimes I think the end's coming quick
My old ass father shot twins out his dick
So, if they so happen to come up without a older brother
Won't be alone cause coming up at least they'll have each other
At least they'll have one another cause life's a motherfucker
But while I'm here my only job is not to see 'em suffer
Through dope boys, shootouts, stick-ups and undercovers
The world is full of suckers but don't worry, I'm your buffer
Buffer, like I shoulda been for BJ
Well he never listened to nothing we say
(It was) half past 12, midnight on a weekday
Not even 20 hours past his release date (lease date)
This nigga hit him up four times, one kick the heart
And that kicked my heart
Call his pops, niggas pick the phone up
So he can come find his son lyin in his own (blood) blood
On that block that we ran through
House we grew up in, corner we would post on
Shot dead in front of niggas we would be with
So how the fuck nobody see shit? (nigga)
And so I'm there to be a brother to his brother Lucky
Cause in the belly of the beast I know this shit get ugly
Get on my knees and have a convo with the Lord above me
Maybe sometimes I hear him wrong, I think he saying ""Fuck me""
Only he could judge me, care less what they thinking of me
Cause honestly I'd be aight if no one ever love me (love me)
I write ""I only fear Joe"" in blood
Smeared slow on my brain by my earlobe (earlobe)
And I ain't gon' stop 'til a nigga see blood on the wall!
Y-yo, yo, yo
All I tried do is raise the bar
See my, weeks is scabbed up, days are scarred
Still I love to see a motherfucker hate from far
More they talk 'bout me the more I pray for y'all
I mean, I don't get how Prodigy gon' acknowledge me
When the nigga 'bout as big as an apostrophe (ohh!)
For him to possibly think that he is hot as me
Is far from a prophecy, it's more like a mockery
Used to be hip-hop to me, 'fore you bombarded me
With everything ass like sodomy, 
it's gotta be drugs
Four-fifths and snubs, what's that about?
Nigga you can't lift the guns that you rapping 'bout (ohh!)
But real talk, 
I can't front on your old shit
Now you just old as shit! Not old and sick
'Stead of holding my dick, here's a better way (dawg)
Never mind me, worry about your Medicaid
... Shit's so unfair
Nigga beats carried yo' ass most of your career
Wanna blog, here's a reason How the FUCKS ""Murda Muzik""
Anybody ever diss this nigga is still breathing
Jay-Z

Saigon,
 
Nas
 
already peeled him
2Pac
, 
he ain't alive but you ain't kill him
50 signs the bum only cause where he was from
Put his stamp on a nigga and still nobody feels him
Not a murderer, a gangsta, robber
Washed up 90's nigga, now a gangsta blogger
Me that, underground flow strike like the pound blow
Your sound's old, not even worth a download
I would have niggas hunt you like a hound's nose
Problem is you pussy, the whole town knows
So why let the body count grow
For some fiend-out nigga now starring in a clown show

Hello Expectations,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Check
It’s time to educate a lurcher if you're featherweight by nurture
Looking for a fix, I’m here to medicate and nurse ya
Was putting this shit off, and know I hesitated further
Even me thinking bout it is premeditated murder
So, if when I levitate, it disturbs ya
You ain’t gotta ask who I dedicate this verse to
You brothers - I tried to see shit in all shades
So I’m prepped when they finally show they true colors
Ain’t gotta worry about who I’m trying to appeal to
If all I do is keep it in 5th, what up Philip Hughes
Public Enemy, I’m just missing Terminator X
Now who am I gonna terminate next?
Hearing all sorts of fables probly...
Who if you choose to believe will have you thinking I’m unstable
Contrary to belief, I weighed all I brought to the table
And decided that relationship wasn’t worth being faithful
Words from the wise: When you lie make sure the trail is gone
And don’t expect a happy ending less you in a nail salon
(Nigga)
A matter of time before the jerks'll start
It makes sense I’m being framed, I’m a work of art
But if you broke dog
Don’t blame the economy
Don’t come with a handout
Don’t try to E-Honda me
See, I never ask niggas to come and be fond of me
You met your match now, what up eHarmony
(Hook)
Hello expectations, know I had to greet you
It don’t matter where you at, I’ll always come and meet you
Hello expectations, we can skip the small talk
Probly thought I disappeared and thought that I was all talk
What you been smoking?
You keep getting higher
But that ain’t never been a problem, I keep getting nicer
Hello expectations, who do it like me?
I think you got a good idea of who it might be

Been in this game 8 years, ain’t fell off, no bragging
It’s just been a lot of John Doe and toe taggin
The jeans Taverniti, footwear is old fashioned
Barkleys, Jordans, maybe do some Bo Jackson’s
All I’m hearing is coke rapping with no passion
From dudes getting fucked like something Chris Stokes imagined
Black Benz, fuck an R-class, no wagon
Way I’m on that turn pike you will think the pope passing
If you got an assessment of what I represent (Dog)
It’s more then likely negligent if we was never friends
Popping shit online, haven’t even met me
You’s a pussy and a bush, Kardashian and Reggie
Hello expectations, I should look familiar
Every time we meet you tell me ain’t nobody realer
Whatever you expect from me, I always go beyond that
And you be looking shocked as if you thought we lost contact
So if you knew me, you would get why my manners are drastic
Strong minded, a lot of people can’t handle that tactic
To keep it real, politics always hamper the masses
And I rebel cause all I wanna do is hand them a classic
Boo body gotta be right just to lamp on the mattress
Till my accountant pull the trigger I’ll hamper they asses
I'm into fine linen, ma lay a hand on my fabric
Bad bitches, fast cars, no Danica Patrick
Audience is die hard so if my fans spazzin'
You might see the first drive-by from a bandwagon
I’m not a role model, I never claim to be - The
World would be fucked up - If
Yall was the same as me - I'm
Not to be copied off of
Not to be emulated
This music ain’t the club more
So to be stimulated
A nigga far from perfect when you hear my pencil state it
That I would try to be yours
That I would demonstrate it
The naysayer’s talking
It seems I been degraded
And tho I hear their words
None of 'em penetrated
So when its cold out - I
Maker sure I’m insulated
A little food for thought
Hope your mental can take it
(Hook)
Hello expectations, know I had to greet you
It don’t matter where you at, I’ll always come and meet you
Hello expectations, we can skip the small talk
Probly thought I disappeared and thought that I was all talk

But that ain’t never been a problem, I keep getting nicer

Short Summer,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Check it
No regrets, nigga no regards
I know the bar, raise mine, ya'll can lower yalls
What I lack in talent, I normally show in heart
Prolly why they want the encore before the show can start
So if you in my life, know ya part
That's the best way for us to never grow apart
Even through the mid-life crisis', ya'll know who the nicest is
Always tell it like it is in spite of it
Dudes frontin quite a bit, know I've grown tired of it
Sometimes you'd rather just watch the movie than write the script
Authentic, called cynic, raw scented
More vintage, ya'll mimic, all gimmick
I ridicule what's been done
See I ain't fooled by what's spewed bout they income
Lose some you win some
Perception, shit'll give you grey hairs and then some
Inception, are you living a dream or livin' in one?
Haters see me, get to thinking that it can't be all good
So I just kill them with the car, Brandy Norwood
And keep chasin success that ya'll scared of
Done carryin dead weight, I'm no longer the pallbearer
Check, I'm too grown for all the games I don't play with suckers
I'm on the sideline, just watchin the Dave & Busters
But when you think of Joe this is unrefutable
The painter's fucked up, but the picture gon' be beautiful

It's gonna be a short summer
'Cause most of y'all ain't built to last
It's gonna be a short summer
'Cause soon enough your shit gon' pass
It's gonna be a short summer
You had your fun but now it's done
It's gonna be a short summer
A new season has begun

What throne are you an heir to?
How can I be compared to, nigga, you fallin off with a parachute
Your stack short, got some earnin' to do
You're new school, just means you got some learnin' to do
I don't care to argue (nah,) you to easy to tear apart through
What I hear is partial, that whole project is Sarah Marshall (forgettable)
And I don't know what type of shit you on
I tried to make you get the point but you was Chris Duhon
So where's Ray Felton when you need 'im?
When niggas show you who they really are you should believe 'em
Catch me with the top down, turnpike speedin'
Bout to have Jersey on fire like Cleveland
With my back in the wall I ain't never got slayed shit
Lebron was king until that pressure got Wade/weighed
So if you marry the game I'll be at the alter waitin
With some niggas I don't call till it's an altercation
Less bail money, less court cases
More mile high, more vacation
More of my back rubbed, more of my feet massaged
Had me thinkin she invented face time, Steve Jobs
They can't stay afloat, they prolly need a mention
We in two different boats, but yours need an engine
Nerve of you niggas I earth you niggas
Took the meringue out of shorty, birth you niggas
Dog, I hear everything you say
You Steve Irwin to a upset stingray
A lighter to a upset Jean Grey
Now who's hotta, you notta
True scholar, new prada, a few dollars
Niggas want to hit em with the chrome like blaka
I'm waiting for them when they get home like Posada
How did he compare a stove to hells kitchen
That just make a man real mad, Mel Gibson
So death to all the bullshit by any means
Kill em all, hang em from the ceilin using skinny jeans
For aspiring rappers that want to pop a can
For the families of Sean Bell, Oscar Grant
Nigga ya heat wave is almost up
Playing for keepsake you almost fucked
So when you talk about Joe
When you done being critical
Say the painter was wild
But he made sure the portrait was original

It's gonna be a short summer
'Cause most of y'all ain't built to last
It's gonna be a short summer
'Cause soon enough your shit gon' pass
It's gonna be a short summer
You had your fun but now it's done
It's gonna be a short summer

Mic check, 1, 2, 1, 2
Old head said reality is fake and fake's the new real
Nothing prescribed to me, but taking a few pills
Ain't trying to be the dude that's raising the blue steal
Vic's help me escape, they give me a new feel
Unedited, ay'day is a newsreel, some cake and a few bills
Honestly, all it'll take is a few mill (for what?)
For me not to have to portray no true skill (but!)
But lemme just watch what I say, the truth kills
(So) Be careful what you wish for
If I'm totally ignored, I might withdraw
I used to be pissed off, piss poor
Money Chris Paul, (it was) like this short
It was kinda hard to get the whole puzzle working with half a jigsaw
I got mine, let me help you get yours without getting ripped off
I left a trail nigga, follow it

We are like birds of a feather

Make your own motherfucking footsteps nigga, don't follow mine!
Huh!? I got great problems though, my problems are good!
L-Look, look, look
New suit, dude nervous (what else?)
Old case, new judge, new verdict (what else?)
A new outcome like somebody reversed it
(I mean I'm) I feel like I'm a new man, a new purpose
(Oh!) It's like a nigga ain't feeling so worthless
Kneel down and worship, all them years was worth it
So when he opened his mouth, I was stunned
He said, You can't deny man his son. Be clear
So if he wanna be there, you let him be there
Be fair, I mean, I can see he wants to be near
I can see that he cares
I'll lock your ass up you don't oblige, beware. (I mean it)
She stared, she scared
My lil dude always get the world from me
And you want him to have the world, just not from me
Back like I never left, was never forced away
Got nothing more to say. Oh!

All these years, they ain't done you no justice

I mean you all fucked up, can't get cash
Still bitter over a past you can't get passed. (Huh?!)
Just sad, get mad cause my bitch bad
Ay'day she switch heels, switch bags. (Whoa!)
It's like we living on a dock nigga, big pad
You can't afford a deposit on my closet. (Not even)
Since you, all I ever known was fly shit
Unfortunately, you ain't fitting that logic
Cause you're much less
Sometimes you gotta stand by your failures to recognize your success
Still, I'll be the bigger man and wish her all the best
While knowing she'll never get it
So why would she ever quit it, it's ridiculous

Sometimes I think it's just useless
So y'all don't hear a lot of new shit
Clueless, dependin on what my mood is (ohh!)
Sometimes I wanna dress down
I mean I wanna let up, but y'all be let down
I'm so easily sidetracked
I just lost my train of thought, but besides that
I wanna stop somebody and keep it real
But know that they'll understand 'fore I tell 'em how I feel
I wish I knew how to feel
I swore I needed somethin from the store (like what?)
Got a call that I just ignored, my day is hectic
I'm overwhelmed with thoughts, leave a message
This Saturday I, planned on goin shoppin for my kid
Wanna smoke, no cig's, I'm like ""Where the fuck's the store?""
Got a migraine, but I forgot that I was sick
Cause these jeans don't seem to lay right over my kicks
And this'll be the last time I buy this brand
That I try this brand - oh shit, the bitch called me
She seems like the perfect girl to cheat with
Sleep with, I bet that she can keep a secret
I turned the radio on, and heard a beat sick
Know I can kill that shit better than he did
Sometimes I could be so analytical (why?!)
With no audience, so who am I a critic to? (nobody)
I'm so easily sidetracked
I just lost my train of thought, but besides that
I spent years tryin to figure out why is that
Beat of my drum thrown off by a hi-hat (ohh!)
I should hit the club, get a outfit
But fuck that, the lifestyle ain't about shit
That no longer gets me up, it don't arouse shit (why?)
See I'm on my OnDemand in the house shit
I've lost so many relationships
(Tell me) Is it, just because I don't relate to shit?
Me I (me I) I hate ignorance so much
I'm prayin for niggas that didn't grow much
Maybe our whole generation was raised wrong
I'm only responsible for me, I gotta stay strong
I'm so easily sidetracked
I just lost my train of thought, but besides that
I spent years tryin to figure out why is that
... Why? But besides that
Uh uhh, I'm so easily sidetracked!
Uhh, goin on nigga, I spent years tryin to figure out why is that
Why? I mean, I'm so easily sidetracked
Fuck is goin on?
Yo, cig's still unlit, lookin a pic of a man cross-eyed
On my way to kill the nigga 'til the thought died (uhh)
Or it's a lie, I'm just hogtied
Got frog eyes, cause chick with a phatty walked by
Nice complexion, nice tan
And so behind her I ran 'til I seen her desination was a man
(So) In the street I stand, with my heat in hand
For what reason, I don't remember beefin
Note to self on my hand, ""Get even!""
But I don't remember needin re-venge
Now anybody comin toward me I'm reachin
Leg bleedin - (so) fuck it
I'll retrace my steps followin the path of my blood leakin
Led me to Juan's house which I visit every weekend
To my knowledge, me and him wasn't speakin",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-sidetracked-lyrics
World Keeps Spinnin’,Escape Route,2009.0,"Yeah...
Escape Route
Let's go

And the world keeps spinning! 
I feel like the world keeps spinning 
And the world keeps spinning
It's like the world keeps winning
And to spite me the world keep grinning

I ain't trying to bother none
So how I end up bothersome?
Yeah you damn right I'm my father's son
Minus prison, minus over 20 years in the system
But don't take away the wisdom
Holy water won't cleanse him
Hardheaded, won't convince him
A nigga wear pride like it's denim
Fuck who don't get along with me
I'm alright with everything that's wrong with me
And that's how it's going to be
That opinion is mine, motherfucker, it belong to me
So get mad at it, half beast, half addict
Can halfass it and be better than rap bastards
Black 'matic, give me room asthmatic asthmatic
I spit high class acid, I'm positive, now that's magic
I'm trying to change shit like a Panther
Asking the right questions but getting the wrong answers


I could talk about how a nigga trade slugs
Boast about, toast and what the .38 does
But a nigga seen what happened to the fam of J-Hud
So I thank God for every morning I wake up
Wait up! I could front as if everything's fine
But my grandmother's dying, and shes 89
Older but her mind about as sharp as mine
If this world were mine I would rewind time
To a time when her heart didn't leak that fluid
She needs surgery, doctors talking stupid
Said ""she already lived her life so she can afford to lose it""
Talking like their tools is useless
Ain't that some shit, she gotta approve it
Grandma ready to go, she'd rather them not do it
No matter how much it might hurt me
Another lesson learned, some fights ain't fight worthy
Jersey


I'm waiting on a true revival
I'mma call you a coward if you alive and suicidal 
Either be grateful for everything God said you supposed to get
Or pull the trigger and get over it
Hip Hop's Poster-Kid
, all this weight on my back
But you ain't gotta spot me, I can shoulder it
Life's a rollercoaster, that ride gonna be easy
Why don't you believe me? My parents was high when they conceived me
Say I got a couple control issues
I disagree, I just like to control issues
My train of thought, my state of mind
Is I could change the world one state at a time
With the matters of every hater aligned
Got an agenda, I just feel like ya'll should cater to mine
Ideas brilliant, perservere, I'm resilient
Until the world change, I be right here chilling

Send Him Our Love,Mood Muzik Vol. 3.5 ,2007.0,"Listen, if you listen to this it's evidence you tryin to figure out if I'm due
Or maybe somebody told you I'm that dude
Or maybe you one of the few that disagree with me
And got your own views about who's really that dude
Well, the South movement got ten months left
And come Valentine's Day the game will merge to the West
And I feel it's absurd that the East is the sellin the less
Screamin 'New York. New York', the pioneers supposed to be the best
You blame it on the vets for our current state of the game
They won't retire, so the generation just remain the same
A bunch of opportunists that was given opportunity
To make a difference in music but gave no opportunity
Nothing new or fresh, it's just the same ass sound
Same old producers, with the same ass sound
Up and coming artists got identity crisis
Cause whenever you you, the labels turn you away
But when you me you think of a way
To cast the criticism aside, get on a track, say what the fuck you wanna say
The radio's goin to play, whatever the listeners say they should
And not what the listeners say they should, indeeed they should
Indeed I should, SMACK a few niggas like Suge!
But then there they'll blackball me
And that's a long story, no crossover so I wrote the Crossover
But if the album sell out, I'd be considered a sellout
The fans keep asking, 'When's the album going to come out?'
Ask your local execs, I'm out
 (*echo*)
We call this one ""Send Him Our Love""
Rest in peace to Stack Bundles

I still recall
A sad café
How it hurt so bad to see her cry
I didn't want to say goodbye

Uh
I know you up there doin it big
(DJ ON POINT)

Look, what up Ray? Was speechless, I ain't know what to say
Got the call like at 8 AM, with Nate saying
You had passed away
, I'm like why niggas stay playing?
Your MySpace page playing, it started my day aching
It hit me like a tumor, felt like it was too soon to
Thought it was a rumor, until it wasn't a rumor
Can't believe that it's over
But if God called you, I ain't even mad at him, he must've needed a soldier
I was like your mentor, you was like my friend, nah
When I seen you, I would treat you like my kin and more
We used to scream 'fuck these niggas!' like Tim Dog
You was the only rap nigga I would fend for
Was fiending for beats, stuck between your dream and the streets
You just wanted to be seen as elite
Cause you loved Far Rock like I love Jersey, so I feel ya
But love something too much, guarantee it'll kill ya
For real a

Send her my love
Memories remain
Send her my love
Roses never fade
Send her my love
Memories remain
Send her my—
Send her my love

You nah mean? 
I remember we
Was in the studio doing, doing ""You Know What'll Happen""
It was me, you and Cau (you know what'll happen)
You told me to keep my verses sixteen
I said, ""You know I can't do that!""
I went ahead and gave 'em mad bars, you was mad as fuck
You went and tried to stretch your shit out, I wasn't having it though, nigga

Look, 
Riot Squad keep your head up
Remember we would diss each other on tracks, laugh about it when we met up
I'm looking in your casket, praying a nigga get up
For a minute, I couldn't help but think that you was set up
No matter who you are, you got to answer when the Lord calling
I told you go and fuck with Jimmy, that's before ""Ballin""
Go get your cash right, hard to slow down livin the fast life
I just heard you on Flex show last night
Like was it old beef or was you gettin stuck up?
A line outside your funeral, Ran was really fucked up
And I was too but the difference is
I was more in awe at the ignorant value of life that living gets
Pulled the burner on you, but you fought that dude
I read the paper, it said the pigs caught that dude
It's sad another black man, taken by a black hand
Was your last night in the club, we could have saved your last dance
God damn!

Send her my love
Memories remain
Send her my love
Roses never fade
Send her my love
Memories remain
Send her my—
Send her my love

I remember like
I remember we was in Cancun
That was my first time out there in Cancun
Me and you was rollin together
You talkin about 'where the bitches, where the bitches, where the bitches at?'
Like nigga I don't know, you supposed to be ""The Gorgeous Gangsta""
Don't ask me nothin, I don't speak no Spanish
I love you nigga

I know the kids really need you
I keep telling 'em, Pac wanted to sign you and Big wanted to see you
Pun wanted to cypher
L wanted you to bring some of that good kush up and get a little higher
Go and help Jam Master Jay get the crowd hyper
Or maybe Freaky Tah switched up and needed a writer
Maybe Aaliyah single up there and need a rider
Know you and Rick James would set the studio on fire
You in a better place up there at the pearly gates
You could be ""The Gorgeous Gangster"" and niggas won't hate
Some niggas tapped the bottle, pour out a little Hennessy
I'm in the clouds, screamin ""Squad Up"" in your memory

Send her my love
Memories remain
Send her my love
Roses never fade
Send her my love
Memories remain
Send her my—
Send her my love

I remember when you called me that day, I think you was in Far Rock
And you had some bitch in your car and your car broke down
And you called me talkin about
'Do I got AAA and shit?'
I'm like 'nah, but at least that answer your question'
And you like 'what question?'
I'm like 'well, I just heard a song of yours
Talking about you wanted to know why she won't stay with you
And she want go ride with a G'
Haha, I love you nigga
Uh, and rest in peace",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-send-him-our-love-lyrics
Spring Training,Mood Muzik 4.5: The Worst Is Yet To Come,2011,"Nah, we ain't even in the same class
We ain't the same type of niggas
Yeah we both in the Escalade, but (spring training)
'Bout 40,000 dollars difference on this one (uh, uh)
You got me fucked up (y'knahmean, TALK TO 'EM!)
Check this, Joey (TALK TO 'EM!)

Look, we gon' need more than a block, we monopolizing
Nah, I'm not rapping, I'm prophesying
Quite simply, seat back, diamond white Bentley
Approach it I might empty, since I never gave a FLUCK
Ain't nothing you can say that might offend me
Not when only reason shorty's in the ride is to Karrine me
When you do a little better they begin to hate ya
So I keep animals with me, it's just in my nature
If you don't wanna hear the real then I ain't finna make ya
You just keep hearing what's coming from them incinerators
But when they show the hatred is when you know you made it
Me, I been to hell and back the shit is over rated
But every day could be your last, so if trouble met me
He'll be with a few of Viagras and a couple Beckys
You want a crash course? Know the damages
I promise y'all that if I got high I'd smoke Canibus
From best to worst, from legend to barely here
Since they repo'd your prime this shit ain't really fair
Losing his mind, somebody better set him straight
Lost Buckingham Palace, now it's Section 8
In '012, why rep that hard?
And who the FLUCK dug him up from Wyclef's backyard?
But off him, not a part of you is trife
And you can't afford the drama when your Arsonal's a knife
No heart in you to survive, nigga living like an orphan
Beefing 'bout Jersey but you living in New Orleans
I ain't even got to stab you, far from a threat
I don't get why a Hitman felt he needed to Holla at you
Come to rapper shit, you real bad at matching wits
I'm better with a badder bitch, how I'm not the catalyst?
When the shots finish flying I bury the biscuit
I fall off the same day Tyler Perry admits it
But what stifles me is how you sit back and idly
Call this a rivalry when your idol's me
How you throw a shot at everything you try to be?
Sad part is nothing in your life coincides with me
Now tell me that's your strategy son
The clip's extended, they looking like Natalie Nunn
Sayin' we can blow the shotties how is he supposed to stop me?
As a hobby I get high inhaling decomposing bodies
And if you decide to cross Joe, I'll be waiting with a crossbow
And feed his torso to my baby cane corso
Shit has gone far enough, it's time to finish this
Should stop starting chess matches 'gainst the limitless
Friends with my foes so my peers are annoyed
Everyday they just watch me cry tears of joy
I don't care for the ploy, came up from being hella broke
You think the fans are buying music, I'm selling hope
Here's some insight homie, fuck making a friend
My funeral gon' be by invite-only
By chance I'm going to hell maybe for selling dope
I want my own table sectioned off with a velvet rope
Might want to see Heaven, might need a telescope
A girl to restock anytime the wine cellar's low
Bottle service, maybe a couple whores
High ceilings, flat screens and double doors
I'm not a cult member, I'm not a worshipper
Just a Jers nigga trying to have a couple words with her
Strollin' through the hood 'til she seem outta place
Used to niggas blowing her up that'll cling to her waist
Me, I've never been a nigga that a fiend had to chase
Ask for Gucci all you gon' get is cream to the face
So I put my G stacks up against your little weed stash
A one time only event, won't get a recap
Aim it at his knee caps, have niggas in your crib
When you get home, your lil' girl in the back they think it's TCAP
So y'all can put all the blaming on me
But keep in mind this is training for me, tah

(TALK TO 'EM!!!)
Niggas put all the blaming on me
Keep in mind this is training for me, cock, sucker",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-spring-training-lyrics
Inception,Mood Muzik 4: A Turn 4 The Worst,2010,"The bars show you mad struggle
Along with detailed scriptures of my past trouble
That’s why they try to keep me quiet with a bad muzzle
Can’t take the same leaps and bounds as me
When they lack the hustle and the calf muscle
Words from a legend speaking from the heart
Said, if you going to war, weaponry is a start
Do your dirt all by your lonely, let it be in the dark
You givin birds bread then let it be in the park, Joey
Tip me wrong, mini mall when the semi’s warm
Bout my bread, so I spot it if a penny’s gone
And I’ll bet, learned that from the nets
If you tryna be a Billionaire get rid of any Thorn
Cause you’ll get f-cked if they shoot you, emptied on
It’s just they way of making a mini porn
I watch my haters get sick
If it’s that hard living in my shadow
Get off my silhouette’s dick
Tailor made suits, double breast fit
Set trip, get your name on the next clip
Sometimes before you can add you gotta minus
Some of y’all don’t get the math or the science
It means I’m aiming for wealth
Some say sky’s the limit I say you’re short changing yourself
So uh ha, uh ha, y’all ain't the same as me, I get bread
You lose Jackson’s, Jermaine Dupri
BS about Joe, refrain it please
You’ll just untame a beast, he just became unleashed
All who defame are deceased, so the topic should pass
An assembly line would show em I'm not in they class
Had some alright jams, them fans came and left
And you ain’t know they was one night stands
Let em testify, witness’s, hearin is indicative
Niggas is sick of it, let it go, and get a grip
(Hook)
I think I’m Sug’ Ray, Ali
Joe Fraiz’ who the fuck gon stop me
He think he Holyfield, Iron Mike
Fo’ fifth let em feel what the iron like
I think I’m Mayweather, Pacquiao
Screamin money ain’t a thing pullin stacks out
I think I’m Cotto, Shane Mosley
Slow death to anyone who oppose me
(Verse 2)
Sun I’m a always shine, yellow
Think I’m about to get up on that? HELL NO
Long as shorty keep my tip hard, shell toe
Certain I’m a stick to the script, velcro
Ringers?, fakers, thinker, faders, prosper
Without being linked to the majors
My only response is the finger to haters
Watch it get ugly, Mbenga, Lakers
So when they ask how I feel about hip hop
I sighed and replied take a lucky guess
Just being sincere, I ain’t talking pioneer’s
When I tell dudes I don’t think the Dougie’s fresh
Used to roll through the trenches, slept on cold benches
Holds on my expenses, smoke till I was senseless
Now the flow’s so relentless
Fuck CD’s it should be sold in syringes
I can’t explain it they love the sound
Subtle with the pound, you don’t want trouble clown
If I’m at the bar ordering a couple rounds
I’m in between 2 birds like a double down
Where I’m from they cock and shoot
Like it’s all logical, send a lot of work to them hospitals
Dress the AK up before they pop at you
Handgun’s, night scope, call it the Chopper suit
So if you tired of all the wack dudes, call me in
Rap historian, slash my class’s Valedictorian
Your future’s at a stand still
Must be a flat on that Delorean
I tried tellin them conceded the deals closed
They disagree they believe that they real close
Tough guys turn talk show like Steve Wilko’s
Scream fuck em eat dildos with each pill dose
All the rap dudes they got highly regarded
Tell me they psyche might be slightly retarded
Nowadays before the shows I buy me a cartridge
Those them phony ass dudes they like me to start with
Peepin how the vets wanna stop me
Money where your mouth is Ted DiBiase
And he won’t be able to reach for a biscuit
With O’s on his head like a B-more fitted
Black hoody and black tux
Tearin stacks up, with a model and her rack tough
Gettin my Extreme Makeover on
Knock that bitch down and build her back up
Think twice before you act up
Around flames, wrong time to be gassed up
You never heard blowing smoke from a grass hut
9 times out of 10 it’ll be your last puff
(Hook)
I think I’m Sug’ Ray, Ali
Joe Fraiz’ who the fuck gon stop me
He think he Holyfield, Iron Mike

Ready?
Check me out now

Come along, c-come, come along
But I don't trust niggas, so make sure you come alone
I hand picked you, you think sensibly
They friends with you, don't need 'em to be friends with me
Come along, I'm a take you to some spots that you might like
But bring shades, you gonna need 'em for the bright lights
Grab a drink, invite dykes that like Vic's
We always end up fightin, cause that's my vice
Come along, c-come, come along
And you'll see how it feels when you sittin on the throne
When you so much better but they act like it ain't known
So if somebody else is on it, it's a temporarily loan
Hard to compete when there ain't no competition
If everybody's the best, why I feel like comp' is missin?
Forced to find inspiration when I never had to
So I go against myself, it's a better battle
Now come along, c-come, come along
Turned up the volume on her favorite song (favorite song)
We got so much in common (except)
Except when it comes to rhymin
She feel like lyrics are so intrusive
But I feel about her, the way she feels about music
She's cute
She don't like the words, she just like the beat and I'm thinkin me too (biatch!)

Let it breathe
Come along, c-come, come along
Can we dim the lights? Let me get into my zone
Come along, c-come, come along
But I don't trust a soul, so make sure you come alone
Let it breathe

Check it, come along, c-come, come along
And watch these niggas that's doin it all wrong (whoa)
Throwback swag, nigga still doin rims (word)
Still doin throwbacks, you still doin Timbs? (word)
Lookin for a way to save, you ain't earnin no cake
Moved back in with moms, she won't turn you away
Then you all on the blogs, showin off a CL
When it's followed by the K, gotta know it's a mistake (baby)
Benefit of the doubt homie, if that ain't your daughter's car
I suggest you stop rappin about a Audemars
Cause in return, I'm a just call a fraud
Every time I hear a bar about the baller you are
Now listen, come along, c-come, come along
She gonna probably drop her drawers, if she step into my home
She gonna probably be on cock
It's big enough to get Lost in without Jack or John Locke (whoa!)
On the water like an island, thinkin she on the dock
So she puttin in work, I'm thinkin she on the clock
Uh, slow down baby girl, what you tryin to prove? (huh?)
When you live like me, it's funny what one night can do (AH!)
 - w/ ad libs

Come along, c-come, come along
Is you niggas out your mind? (nigga!)
Is it hard to recognize when you out your prime?
Maybe they can't imagine livin life without that shine
Walk around Hollywood like you so in demand
But when the labels stop backin nigga, so do the fans
Nigga you ain't a superstar, no allure about you
And when you talk about me, it says more about you
Now come along, c-come, come along
Wonder why when I ain't around niggas change they tone
That's the way it looks
Do they really think whatever they say behind my back'll manage to stay put?
We know the same people, go the same places
From the same hood, can only be so evasive
Come along, c-come, come along
When you're from where I'm from, you're gonna probably need the chrome
It ain't just me, it's like that where we all from
Thought some of them niggas just do it out of boredom
Some just preppin for the day they see a war come
Hangin in the wrong place if you never saw one
Now come along, c-come, come along
I don't know who you done dealt with in the past
Better be self sufficient ma, you don't get a pass
Cause your thighs a little thick and you got a little ass
You lookin for a sugar daddy, then go for it
Twenty somethin years old with nothin to show for it (show for it)
Talkin about she was raised different
Well get your own pockets bitch (biatch), so was I (OH!)
Now really, come along, c-come, come along
I don't call them verses, they similar to poems
Similar to scriptures, similar to pictures

You're not listening to this

Yeah... talk to 'em! Ohh
HUH? Joey!
It's, it's, that on top music
Must be I'm just avoidin the inevitable, dodgin my fate
So many things a nigga gotta escape
Autobiographical, I need my life to maybe hop on a page
That'll end with a sigh, goodbye, with my mouth open cockin a gauge
How you the greatest at your job, but they dockin your pay?
Guess when God's holdin a bar they start mockin your ways
Murder my fans while I'm rockin on stage
Naw let me chill, I ain't thinkin at a logical state
I catch 'em while they noddin they head, sayin the words
And start a blood bath, right as they repeatin the verse
At the show let 'em know that they help lead to me bein disturbed
I'm thinkin {""You're not making any sense""} ha ha, listen (OHH!)
How much longer you expect me to be degraded
By niggas who can't appreciate bein appreciated?
Y'all made this beef related
One less person to judge, just one more problem alleviated (HUH?)


Ya mean, uh, fruck's goin on?
Yeah! Listen
I'll stand before your honor, without a alibi, lost kinda
Just a product of a lost genre
Cuffed like I'mma cause drama, headline un-remorsed trauma
Sweat drippin from my head like I performed a concert
No alibi for my unlawful conduct
I need a pardon from the president, call Obama
And tell him I was goin all out
I was doin God's work, I thought the nigga called out
{""Snap out of it, you're not making any sense""}
They don't hear me, check it!
You lookin at a more honest improve in me
All of the comments and scutiny, drive him to lunacy
Committin hate crimes as if I got immunity
A opportune time to have opportunity
Not, but when he don't stop by it just ruins me
Pride is persuin me, why's it rebukin me?
I got demons by my door, staked out
I'm inside goin over my escape route
 w/ Budden singing along

Now I've had it up to here
Don't ever try that again
Why are you so quiet so suddenly?
Go on, have it
You're just dying to tryyyyy me!

Yeah, uh-huh-uh, uhh
Muh'frucker, uh, uh
Let me tell you
Yo, see I'm in search of privacy
On e'ry social network, but don't wan' network with society
That's, probably why my net worth ain't so high to me
These Percosets work, now they FUCKIN with my sobriety
I'm chasin a hit - all in Heath Ledge
+Dark Knight+ overdose, I ain't chasin the SHIT!
I got a audience, they just got me hatin this shit
Or is it how I view life, and how vacant it is
Watch me and see a horrible movie, bad reviews
Scattered views with a cold heart, wrong attitude
I ain't got a thing in common with these rapper dudes
Nigga! {""You're not making any sense""}
Okay, aside from some drawn-out thoughts, mags and tools
I don't think they know what it FEEL like to be battered, bruised
And still they can't see me with the ink
So try fuckin the world ain't as easy as you think, nigga!

I ain't worry about the win as long as I get the girl in the end! (girl in the end!) (Ho!)
Y'all niggas be dead, if looks could kill
My money taller than y'all; y'all spending Bushwick Bills
And y'all ghetto! (and y'all ghetto!) - Squeezing — you weak when I spark metal (whoo!)
You leaking, therefore you're squeaking to falsetto!
My shit is nothing like you heard before
Get it, right? My shit is knocking like our words be doors!

When he rhyming (whoooo!) off the pa-tron! - You might wanna quit trying!
He will burn you like Penny's mama offa Good Times!
I'm fly as shit, but grounded like the Gaza Strip!
But let's be honest, I'm surrounded by a thousand tits!
I claimed the town before I give you lames the crown
You'll get it soon as Snoop gains a pound
Hahaha! - We too vicious, plus we got pits in the back an'
""Dirty Money"" like them two bitches Puffy backin'
(Whooooooo-Aaaahhhhhhhhhh!)

Livin' off interest! - Stock exchange!

So I take mine elsewhere, I'm Rick Rubio!
Homie make sure you speak to me sober
One in the head - heat in holster don't care if you cross
Country! (yeah!) - I'm there before the weekend's over
And you'll be (YOU'LL BE!) swingin' at the air - no Wii controller!
But I don't care to speak on chrome
Hard to not live a movie when you got theater seats at home!
No wonder she wanna chill, seat back with her friends
She seen when I dump boo I let her keep that Benz!
Dick got 'em actin' like they on a relapse binge!
Start kickin' my door down like I don't need that hinge!
The realest to ever do it, he a must in the game (game!)
If you don't get the picture then readjust the frame! (Talk to 'em!)
It's simple mathematics, Einstein!
Learnt to walk a fine line off that battle shit, it's grind time! (grind time!)
Rap for hire! Call me if help is needed!
I got this whole shit covered - Darrelle Revis!
(AAAAAAAAAAGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!)
So if you lookin for me
I'm relaxing with a bird or Hell's Kitchen, asking for dessert! ('ey, 'ey!)
So when I'm recordin' dummies become non-important
They think the Book of Eli was written by Tom Coughlin
I ain't with the trash talkin', that's distortion! (that's distortion!)
Mass extortion! - All of your raps is appallin! (Nigga!)
Want see me dead?
I'll invite 'em to the funeral and they can keep the stains off my glass coffin! (Glass coffin!)
Yep it's Joe, irregular flow!
If your ones ain't Gayle King right next to a ""O""!
It's not a thing, just lie! Be the next to blow
I don't need a private jet, just a window seat, exit row!
And if I decide to peel arms - I'm interrupting
With no pardon! - I ain't Mike Wilbon!
From day one, he just speak his mind
Cause looseleafs don't come with subtitles, can't read between the lines!
But think anybody on your TV be
In your top of elite three, then CC me!
5th gear! - We kickin' up dust mothafucka! (DUST MOTHAFUCKA!)
We only competin' with us mothafucka! (FLOCKA!)
Hope everybody had a good time out there!
Huh?

Hey yo, I can't lie
Spent a few years trying to understand why
When, how is it now I'm so anti
Face asked if you've ever seen a man cry
I think before that shit ain't even pan right
So I don't look at rap dudes like you fans might
Rude, true it's skewed I got a slant eye
With God as my security guard that's why
I'm walking around feeling like I can't die
Or I'm feelin' like opportunity ran by (me)
And I'm chasin' it or am I facin' it
(NIGGA) No past, I'm erasing it
I'm an addict got a habitual habit and I don't avoid voids
Good at substitution replacing shit
I'm just trying to find my place with shit
Pacing quick I ain't go no patience with
Niggas that can't speak they mind
What the fuck they got a mouth for?
Me, I'm so full of rage so used to being caged
I probably shouldn't be outdoors
Everybody so scared of the truth
Look in my eyes you stare at the truth
They doing interludes and every interview
Talkin' bout they're prepared to shoot - bom, bom
How thoughtful, won't resort to gettin' near a booth
They awful what I do to them unlawful
Boss dude ain't got a higher up to resort to
Just giving yourself a bad name
Yackidy yack the threats in fact is that lame
You can't tell that acts arranged
Think I'm wearing a bulls eye
Just all them cats got bad aim I'll explain
I'm past real they past phony
Ignore the personal and physical attacks on me
I remain cool relaxed homie
Brand new I ain't got a scratch on me
So what your squad gonna do
Lay a hand on me I'll lay a hollow on you
Change hands tap his pockets run his wallet on through
Every club in New York nigga bottles on you!
Better tell 'em what reluctance is
I'm controlled by uncontrolled substances
Truth be told, I'll show him what substance is
Know I'm nice but when I boast I'm only rubbing it in (NIGGAS)
Got beat up ignored in school
Signed a deal niggas thought you was cool
Only take one quarter to slaughter your crew (SLAUGHTERHOUSE)
If your resume got deaded today they'd call you a fool (HOW BOUT THAT)
All them years rapping, nothing else happening
You need a new day to day
Old heads in the game with no other way to get paid
Gasping timeout take a break from the play or grab a Gatorade
Bad contract team can't make a trade
Majors fucking you in the ass you gonna stay a slave
5'9""
 
in my ear saying, ""Hey, behave!""
But shit is fucked up and I blame it on the way it was paved
I chill for the sake of your age
You great live but let me know when that stage get appraised
All in raising the stakes
Swear you and your label should pray
Thank God I was placed in this decade by mistake
I don't belong here dad fucked mom in the wrong year
Wrong peers amongst niggas with wrong ears
Wrong dancing funny sounds every songs weird
Wrong fashion its like everybody's gone queer
Be clear I ain't here to be friends
You can dislike me I ain't here to pretend
Run but you can't hide I can't lie
Told niggas in the first two bars I was anti
Oh!
Leave me running!

Ventilation,Mood Muzik Vol. 3.5 ,2007.0,"Time goes by, puffin' on lye
Hoping that it gets me by, got a nigga going crazy

Some niggas wanted to kill me, got locked up and never found me
So my goal is to catch a charge in that same county
Picture me gettin' bumped for a silly hand-off
The bullpen's fucked up, just ask Willie Randolph
See I could pop a few nickel plated Glocks too
It's easier to kill niggas than it is not to
I let the pot brew, then the plot grew
It the labels job to label you don't fit it and they'll drop you
Finally made a move on something, I been saw
Sometimes you got to lose the fight
If you tryin' to win the war, I'm focused on tomorrow
I'm done seein' my friends in the rearview, thinkin' we really closer than we are
Fuck the record label
No relation or correlation all my admiration just turned aggravation they say
How you sit so long when you spew classics
I tell niggas I can't understand that's, that blue magic
The rap game as is either you on some snap shit
Or plan ol' stuck in a different decade like the brat is
I hear niggas joints and take it personal WHY
Now everybody want to spit about their personal lives
Before that was non existent
Me I'm an addict with an addition for anything that seems to cause friction
Maybe I'm in a relationship with bad Karma
What her past the somber maybe I attract drama yeah
Undoubtedly my life is on some VH1 shit
Just adding some salt and pepper to reality
 while
Other artists is obsessed with more toys
Like Lex coup, Beemers, and Benzes -- they're lost boys
Un I kept brushing off my shoulder till the chip was going
Left the benz at the dealers till the kit was on
I don't feel niggas songs
So while ya'll at the awards
I'm loading up on ratches that's the tip I'm on
Flow is on acid, I swear I would have the game mastered
If I wasn't so busy carrying baggage
Calling god a bastard
Calvin look way different in person
Then they had him looking in his casket
I'm looking in his casket like he had no face
I was at a lost for words like Fiasco gate
So I figured I say a prayer for em got on my knees quick
And realized ""I DON'T EVER PRAY UNTIL I NEED SHIT
""
My soul achin trying to stay low maintenance
I'm stuck in hell waiting on, blessing with no patience
I done made the Ave hot, been had to stab shot
Waiting on my jackpot, always been a have not
Always been an under dog little guy still try
Cause I think I'm a cash cow they treat me like I'm milk dry
Juggling nickels and dime I'm walking a fine line
Sometimes you got to just breath maybe give time, time
Give me a sign kind of shock he won't
See I want another baby but my pockets don't
Normally that wouldn't bother me
Til I wake up and get the paper and
Read that some rich nigga won the lottery
Young black and shameless
Shorty keep beefing about the same shit
Almost like yelling her second language
Why do I entertain it
Listen we been arguing about everything for ages, do it ever change shit?
Wind up igging each other for the whole week
It's a lot of men in this world baby you chose me like I chose you
We been rocking for years you signed up
You not a victim, you a volunteer, it's weird
I'm not a cheater, on occasion still fuck a bitch
Who knows why, maybe just to feel coveted
I'm me, she's her, we both had enough of it
But won't leave, we the only ones who put up with it
In all areas its like my stocks crashing
Wishing all these old motherfuckers would stop rapping
Tryna be tasteful, not mad or rageful
Upset or hateful, not complacent, I'm grateful
And I don't wanna resort back to my old ways

Uh
 I'm on it
What us Jers? Clue, what up?
E, what up?
 real quick, check me out now, look

Shout to all my fans, glad I can inspire y'all
Got a couple haters, still tryna acquire more
Ain't gotta be abrupt
I tell em' like I tell my girl, you doing a great job, now keep it up
And I promise I'll take you higher then you ever seen
40 milligram flow, chased by Promethazine
Lack of competitors, yappin' 'bout etcetera
Can't tell if I'm listening to rappers or treasurers
And as a poet I feel like I owe it not to go astray
So everything inside me Ginuwine, no Solé
You gotta blame it on my upbringing
It goes back to when Tyrese was on the bus singing
Yeah, I guess that's why shorty's attracted to me
Self-made style, the label ain't attach it to me
Aside from when she comes through I get her ribs in order
And the neighbors would know my name if the crib was smaller
But no groupies, them walls are windows
The basement is the movies, pool by the jacuzzi
The hallways echo, the closet is a bedroom
The sauna fits five comfortably, plenty leg room
Like the La Montagne Carwash in the garage
She from the projects so she thinks it's a mirage
Told her I got my own concierge (But)
She was more impressed that she could do her laundry here
But all I'm tryna do is bust her, Flipmode
Problem is I think she seen too many flicks though
She said she'd only be impressed by a diamond ring (Or)
Or if I had a hot tub that's a time machine
These bloggers'll have you thinkin' that I'm abnormal
So when you read it can't say that I ain't try to warn you
I respond so mature, so unlike Joe
What they write though is all wrong, just a typo
I just learned to be alone without an Iso
All a nigga gotta do is take the high road
Two words for my enemies: die slow
Full-time pyro', could do this with my eyes closed
They say you doin' something wrong if all the critics love you
For some it's a career, for some it's just a hustle
Me, all I do is win, that begins
With not rockin' my Lebrons 'less the nigga got a triple-double (Talk to 'em)
Before youse rap dudes put me in ya verse
Assess your situation, picture it being worse
You askin' to get fucked, how could you not assume
It's like inviting Ricky Martin in a locker room
Hip-Hop just a journey
Most number one seeds got clipped just like the tourney
If it don't involve myself, then it really don't concern me

Thou Shall Not Fall,Mood Muzik Vol. 3.5 ,2007.0,"Look I'm on a war path
Tell the opposition
Naw keep it to your self, I'm my only competition
But keep the hate coming
I love the criticism
But understand I'm successful by my own admission
I never had shit
But a bad bitch
Naw let me stop lying mostly they was average
If you'd say my voice would be heard by the masses
A dust head nigga from jerz I wouldn't grasp it
Questions you can ask it
Teamed up with the Klasix
Working on a classic, smash hits, and that's it
Maybe niggas thought my knees gonna buckle
Newport in my mouth with two g's on the buckle
Got more now than them few g's when I hustle
Spanish broad with them two d's like I love you
But sexy lady it was nice to know you gotta move on
They can't chink my armor a nigga to strong
I think niggas is shady but the proofs gone
I put the jewls on case fools thought it was gone you've been warned

I tried to told dudes way back in 02
That eventually the game would go back to being soul food
I mean soulful while everything is woeful
I try to stay fresh like whole foods on the pro tool
But Mista F-A-B wanna mention him
Fell the fuck off I won't mention him
Only respect one Fab and I'm friends with him
Phonte back out I guess nigga pumped sense in him
They went in pumped slugs in my little brother
But dog I still love little brother
This other guy ain't know whose dude
Got glued to you tube I hit Jin asked him if he digested his food smooth
How you beef with Joey did queer with out ears to say he ain't show out of fear
Heathcliff ain't scared of the hoagie
The nerve of the young fork
Yosemite Sam is getting gun ho
Nigga bank account got one o
He could snort lines with his dick and won't come dope
They stringing you along
Don't take it and try to jump rope
Dog this how you know you shouldn't feel glory
Cause I ain't even show and end up being the story I'm sorry

Mic check
I need it to be known
I'm grown
I'm on some next shit
I'm thinking oil money, Texas
Not a necklace
You gotta to shot at mom dukes
Before the techs spit
I don't go out looking for drama like the feds did
Music with a message
But I'm no back packer
Some vengefulness in me
But I'm no back stabber
No baller in the strip clubs I'm throwing cash at her
I'm trying to help shorty and her goals attach faster
Was insecure growing up
Niggas laughed at her
Now she things she got some self worth because her ass' fatter
I told her give yourself the hay suss so
Next time that chain you up you can brake through those
Nigga call you out your name mommy break dude nose
Gotta get you where you going might take you slow
Maybe bend
But never let'em make you fold
Except your short coming baby
They gone make you whole

Better Me,Halfway House,2008.0,"I get a ghetto gospel, only right considering the ghetto was my Hostel
Memory is gone but I’m recalling all through High School
Even at my lowest I was sitting on my high stool, that’s what being high do
If I couldn’t do shit, was always able to tote
They told that a nigga would die before I was able to vote
Probably cause me and my constituents and all the shit we did
The M.R.I couldn’t tell you what the issue is
With my treason came a cause that I believed in
Is it really wrong if a nigga got a reason?
At times I had to take dough, nigga did whatever for a peso
Being from the hood ‘ll be my scapegoat
Or can it be, cause I wasn’t born into a canopy
Maybe I was prone to falling in love with vanity
Tell me shit you reap is the shit you sow
Tell God I’m better then the shit I show, I gotta grow

Another, Dig me up from under what is covering
The better part of me

Now niggas say I floss too much
So, has he changed cause I don’t think that thousand dollar T costs too much
All they should say is that he’s strong, came out the fire unscathed
Yea I carried on, Lou Vuitton carry on
Had the ‘matti’ on, but my blessings at a delay
Now to lace my chick at Esay is sort of cliche
Plane ain’t gon never land, unless it’s in Netherlands
20 on that gold face breightling with the leather band
Asked for a better hand
I tried colliding with my problems, yea, I never ran
That would make me less a man
I ain’t go from not having it to being arrogant
I dreamt, went grabbin it, just being passionate
Some niggas get complacent, why?
Dudes is new born birds just afraid to fly
If your foot's on the brakes, can’t ride
Me, I spread my wings inhale and embrace that high

Another, Dig me up from under what is covering
The better part of me

Give it away, give it away, give it away now!
Give it away, give it away, give it away now!
Give it away, give it away, give it away now!
Give it away, give it away, give it away now!

Part of me was gruesome, I ain’t change, I grew some
And if I did change I’d welcome that shit to come
Dudes that smoked trees with me, dudes that used to be with me
They say I switched up on ‘em and did a 360
Cause I don’t burn it down, but to me it’s common sense
Wanna see the other side? Gotta turn around
Show ‘em ya game face
I tell ‘em we was on the same track but wasn’t running that same race
We ain’t in the same space, but I ain’t gonna change pace
Something won’t let me slow down, I can’t explain fate
So don’t say I went from broke to bourgeois
I’m far from high end, I just know what suits me

Calm down...

Look, I was such a lost soul, just wanted to be down with something
Look at your son now mommy I amounted to something
You couldn't figure out, what I had messed with the streets for
Cause you saw my genius without a SAT score
I took drugs and laced it with things
But you a addict yourself
For you I was people places and things (how the fuck you thought)
Angeldust use to have me in the hallways twurked
I tried to hide it, but Visine didn't always work
I needed someone to blame in my mind
I thought if you and dad never used dope I would a came out fine
And so I igged you hard when you threw in advice
Like what I want to talk to you about you ruined my life
You the reason why I ended up a con and I knew it
The reason I filled my body with that bomin fluid, mommy
You the reason that my life's gone illegal
The reason I'm kinda different, don't think like normal people, not calm

Knowing you the reason why she ain't alright no more
But so young, I was like whatever
You use to chase me through the house with the knife like get your life together
Fucking drugs, how could I ever amp on you
And what made me think that I could lay my hands on you
I'm not surprised that you mad at me
Much as you hated my father, your youngest son is just like his daddy
Mommy I live life rude, how could you not understand it
On the same note I'm just like you
I got moms sensitivity, my fathers balls
His humor, his g, yet my heart is yours
Fuck school, cause I had my major
Come to grips that it ain't so much the drugs, it's the addict behavior (no)
Wasn't the dip jar, it's the cut that came with it
Wasn't really the smoking, but the rush that came with it (wasn't calm people)

She use to tell me to... calm down...
Calm down...
(but a nigga wouldn't) Baby just calm down...
You gotta hold your head up cause we gone make it y'all
(do it with me people) Calm down...
Calm down...
(try to understand it) Baby just calm down...
(those kind of things) Everything's gonna be alright
Calm down... (just bare with me for a... for a brief moment y'all)
Calm down...
Baby just calm down...
You gotta hold your head up cause we gone make it y'all

I felt so alone, I had a crew, but so what
Then when Angela stabbed me guess who showed up
And when people said I'd always be ill and twisted
And when the therapist had told us that the pills would fix it
Was sick of being sick, I was finally hurt
With all the praying that you did ma, it finally worked
God gave you a son back, I won't offend you again
Won't let the disease turn me against you again
Use to be high as ever, (but I) Joey Jr. got his life together
As a result, now we tighter than ever
So blessed, so grateful to be seeing tomorrow (see the whole world)
That's why I can't take a drink, not if even a swallow
I can't picture me twisted, like what I'm a do now
Haters I can't stop yet, my mothers to proud
Secure now, don't need to be down with nothing
Look at your son now mommy, I amounted to something
I'm so calm

I Might Need More Than 16 Tho,#SomeLoveSeries,2014.0,"Turn the beat up in the headphones a little bit
We in here
Parks on the boards, real nigga in the booth
Let's go
Let me talk to 'em, check this

I might need more than 16 though
Champion sweats, gold Rollie, Benz clean though
The Smith in the pocket, bag gang green flow
Some of these fan niggas fickle and it seem so
Still in my prime but this ain't Nickle or Primo
Look what these fuck niggas done to the game
A bunch of cool songs from niggas I can't name
The beat on every single is all soundin' the same
I'd explain but I might need more than 16 though
These hoes hurtin', busy tryna look like each other
They're sharin' surgeons just to get every sir and gent
In the city of fat transfers and body shots
If I gotta ask if it's real then it's prolly not
Pulse missin', uh, 
Pulp Fiction
Relationship quarrels, demons and drug addiction
I know, just some hurdles that I leap until my wealth is up
No time to fight, ma, I do that with myself enough
You gotta pardon me, I'm growin', it's progression
Playin' with her mind, I found her soul in a recession
Major part of why all shorty knows is my perception
Think cause she suck my dick there's an emotional investment
Father of Joseph, Joseph's father
A brother to some others that had no regard for
Got gone for a minute, I had to focus harder
Wanted me off my square, but I'm so unbothered
It's so much goin' on with niggas as of late
That I don't know where to start, I just go from the heart
But the truth can't be all that you want
How can it be so many misunderstandings, always thought I was bought
I thought that common sense, would always be the easiest
To comprehend, now I'm convinced
Fuck shit from fuck niggas, how their time is spent
And an epiphany for them would be a monument
Took a page out of 
Power
, did a homi' on a beat
If I'm Ghost in the club then Tommy in the street
I did enough cause every nigga by me gotta eat
I'd explain, but I might need more than 16 though
I learned to deal with hate
While y'all was nickle and dime-in', I purchased real estate
That was the first mil' I made
Pool parties, plenty models at the villa's lake
One of them hoes was high on coke and couldn't feel her face
They got confused, thought my hunger was gone
Cause I spend 300 thousand last summer alone
If she with you on IG, they'll think you jumpin' a bone
They usually wrong but I might need more than 16 though
Mono y mono, clothes like Mariano

Follow Your Lead,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Uh, I got bitches on my dick, I don't want 'em near
Closet full of brand names, I don't wanna wear
Everybody got advice that I don't wanna hear
World in your palm but you don't wanna share
Still I'm followin you - are you leadin me with a weapon drawn?
Co-dependent on her but got me in bed alone
You say if you love it let it go, nothin set in stone
Plus every rock they throw, I use as a stepping stone
Got questions, say the answer's better left unknown
Though I may not never see you, I should know you never gone
So I break the mirror, cause everything it's showing me is wrong
Grab your hand and go along - cause I'm followin you
I say I should be pleased, what if I'm saddened?
Always say I've been through worse, what if I haven't?

I don't need the lifestyle, I don't need the pain (pain)
I don't need the clubs (uh), I don't need the cars
None of that really matters to me (whoa)
I don't want the bad bitch, I don't want the strain (nope)
I don't want the highs, enough shit on the brain
I don't want whatever's gonna help me be sane
I just wanna follow your lead

You sayin follow my lead, follow, follow my lead
Brought me to my knees, he must wanna holla at me
When the world feel like swallowin me
When every decision costly and I ain't got a dollar on me
Check it, I don't wanna pretend, I don't wanna live a lie
I don't wanna be judged, don't wanna be criticized
I don't wanna talk, there's nothin I wanna say
The more I let 'em get to know me, the more they just run away
And that, must be your way of sayin we should stay together
I know how to fuck it up more than I can make it better
I figured folk around me would learn to take it better
Instead of tryin change me, I've been this way forever
Time will reveal more will be shown
You pushed it, I thought the door closed on it's own
But uh, nevermind what caused it
Livin a dream, nothin in this world powerful enough to pause it, sing

He's sayin follow my lead, follow, follow my lead (uh)
Cig in my mouth, prescription bottle by me
And even when I think you might be makin a mistake
I may not know the destination but I make it there safe
Check it, when I feel like I can't get weaker, uh
You always come and make a cameo or feature
I'm good with my insanity and fevers
Cause Pac's lookin from heaven sayin ""they ain't understand me neither""
A lot of times you leave me exposed
And laugh at me, still thinkin I could be in control
Help me weather the storm, altogether I ain't know him
Cause I always disagree, though you ain't never been wrong
Listen, I was feelin nearly unstoppable
And now I'm facin what appeared to be impossible
Feelin unimportant enough to have to bother you
But I'm down here alone nigga, all I got is you

I can't fit it all in a sixteen

The drop on that jewelry store for fifty
And I backed out last minute like ""nah, this shit look risky""
One of my mans dead, the other one in Poughkeepsie (man)
Another one in the Feds, he'll be there until he's sixty (no!)
I want to thank you for the blessings and the gifts
And the lessons and the messages they left, I get the drift (I know)
Fuck the cheddar or whatever, it don't measure up to this (naw)
I mean never did I ever not remember you exist (woo!)
When I hop up out my bed, hands together and I wish
Swear to you it's from the heart, inside my chest you let it tick (thank you)
I love you from the soul with every spiritual molecule (word)

Wrong One,Rage & The Machine,2016.0,"Let's get some shit out to the forefront
Better not talk behind the store front
You motherfuckers picked the wrong one
Big mistake, I think you niggas made the wrong one
These niggas talking about burners like we don't own those
Blasting this fully automatic, that's soul drums
You motherfuckers picked the wrong one
Big mistake, I think you niggas made the wrong one

They say if money didn't change you, you ain't make enough
They say if you ain't down to bust then never say it's tough
Got a black bitch with a body, name her Nina Skill
Don't do the back and forth racket, but Serena will
There's some couple rules I'mma share with you two
Know, niggas gon' hate you for whatever you do
To let it off you gon' need a right hand and the right wrist
And using the beam mean there was a chance that you might miss
A nigga wanna send me a message, have it delivered to me
Ticket on the coupe, sheriff ain't even give it to me
They want me killed, I'm ready for it
Means I've written my will, so I'm ready for it
But I'm real so be ready for it
Cans and Desi’s for sport
Camouflagin' the cameras and battery ramming doors
We ain't amateurs at all
I flew but sent my mans in the accord
That's a plan moving forward
Do I learn to get these hammers on board, dawg?

Let's get some shit out to the forefront
Better not talk behind the store front

Big mistake, I think you niggas made the wrong one
These niggas talking about burners like we don't own those
Blasting this fully automatic, that's soul drums
You motherfuckers picked the wrong one
Big mistake, I think you niggas made the wrong one

Tell them bitches they can all come
Three ain't mind sharing as long as I get them all to cum
One was an alcoholic, I swear she was drinking all the rum
Two live together Uptown, but be on Fordham some
Scooped them from the Bronx, in a small bed and breakfast fam
What was ironic was these bitches couldn't put egg to pan
Eggs to pan, thing got naked to tan
Or maybe to skinny dip but she ain't wanna wear the pants
I mean I pulled up to the block, swore I was never Neverland
Hardwood all over the crib, stepped in the Meadowlark
Gave her the ""I've been missing you""-dick, she never left again
Now the bitch depressed again, I don't need the stress again
Steal from Rage might as well send it back
I got shooters everywhere, where you gonna spend it at? It's murder
Still a reason they made the dress code
Figure I ain't wanna spread bloodshed on nice clothes

Let's get some shit out to the forefront
Better not talk behind the store front
You motherfuckers picked the wrong one

When It All Implodes,Mood Muzik 4.5: The Worst Is Yet To Come,2011,"(We know the air is unfit to breathe
And our food is unfit to eat
We sit watching our TV's while some local newscaster tells us that today we had fifteen homicides and sixty-three violent crimes, as if that's the way it's supposed to be
We know things are bad, worse than bad.)

They say the world’s coming to an end, homie I don’t care
Bullet proof in my closet that I don’t wear
Niggas talk behind my back as if I won’t hear
Back against the ropes like I won’t dare
Bitch I don’t tear
I know too many niggas facing 25 to life
I know too many ain’t make to 25 in life
Too many look up to me, I’m who they idolize
No soap opera, I ain't your Guiding Light
Worry bout my car and the kit, what up Michael Knight
I bared my all, you would think I’m bout to die tonight
I’m trying not to get stuck, lifestyle of a Trojan
It mean I’m tryna not to get fucked, what up

World keeps spinning as the drama unfolds
I’ll be in the front row
When it all implodes
(I don't have to tell you things are bad
Everybody knows things are bad
It's a depression.)
I got a pocket full of money and a room full of hoes
I’ma have a blast when it, when it all implodes
(Everybody's out of work
A dollar buys a nickel's worth
Punks are running wild in the street
There's nobody anywhere who seems to know what to do
And there's no end to it.)

They say the world’s coming to an end, I find it funny
Cause mine is just beginning
Mine is full of women
Mine's like a roller coaster
But I slow up the ride
Then they get sick to they stomach
But all they could throw up is pride
You talking bout a recession that I cordially ignore
Fuck a dollar if you morally poor
R R R all y'all adore and see is royalty
Nevermind income, spoil me with loyalty
It’s too many fake niggas, not enough real
There's too many emcees, not enough deals
Too many broke, when there's too many bills
Too many ways to attain wealth
Fuck a poor economy, blame yourself
Guess we can’t all leave the hood just rapping
They say society is twisted like it just happened
Nigga, I call bogusness
So if you fucked up, probably cause you just noticed it

(They're crazy
Just like everything, everywhere is going crazy
So we don't go out anymore.)
(We sit in the house
Slowly the world we are living in is getting smaller
And all we say is
'Please, at least leave us alone in our living rooms.')

They say the world’s coming to an end
Now everybody got a complaint
Everybody trying live like they some kind type of saint
Only nigga not trying to be something I ain't
That ain't the picture I paint
And if I did it’d be stained
Life’s a bitch, I’m fully ready to meet her
I’ll be in my best fit, I’ma have the fresh caesar
Since I’m eager, be in the room, dusting off the heater
Have a fully loaded 40 pointed at her when I meet her
Take her to the hood, gunpoint, bitch don’t tempt me
Force her eyes open, look at lives, vacant, empty
No wonder that they shower me with hatred and envy
I’ve picked the wrong nigga couldn't make it against me
Fuck your healthcare, health scare
Even though I’m well aware
Counting down till I pull the trigger, like hell yeah
I be the last time you impose
Legs crossed with my cig lit
Now watch it all implode


(I don't want you to protest
I don't want you to riot
I don't want you to write to your congressman
Because I wouldn't know what to tell you to write
I don't know what to do about the depression and the inflation and the crime in the street
All I know is that first
You've got to get mad
You've got to say
'I'm a HUMAN BEING, GOTDAMMIT! My life has VALUE!')
(I want you to get up now
I want all of you to get up out of your chairs
I want you to get up right now and go to the window
Open it, and stick your head out, and yell
'I'M AS MAD AS HELL, AND I'm NOT GOING TO TAKE THIS ANYMORE!')",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-when-it-all-implodes-lyrics
Stained,Mood Muzik 2: Can It Get Any Worse?,2005.0," The name of this shit right here is called Stained

I'm on the outside and I'm looking in
I can see through you, see your true colours
Inside you're ugly, ugly like me
I can see through you, see through the real you

Lemme talk to them real quick
It's, it's, it's what? It's that On Top music
Niggas said the only cat I cared about is myself
When shit's thick, don't nobody's whereabouts but myself
When you're faced with it all and your back's against the wall
You'll be listenin' but all you hear about is yourself
Tell me what you supposed to do when yourself ain't reliable
You're lookin' in the mirror but yourself ain't desirable
Need another nigga besides yourself on the side of you
Can't listen to yourself, all he do is lie to you
Now tell me who's supposed to have your best intrest
When shit ain't lookin' up, you start havin' less intrest
Tryin' to leave the hood but the slugs keep commin'
Keep chasin' the buck but the buck keep runnin'
I don't trust nobody, I don't love nobody
I don't fuck with nobody but me, I can't lose
No moves'll be funny and I never let myself down
How so? I don't expect too much from me

I'm everything the hip hop critics try to slight
Got no problem bringin' out the shit hip hop hides
So I do the club shit for the blind, they can't see
You write some substance and sometimes they can't read
Needle in the haystack, hidden jewel the most
So fly, down to earth, he's so cool to most
A regular hood nigga with he's two the most
And he's so smart, he's stupid. Still a fool to most
Tell me how could somebody so sane, be so off
So normal, he's not. It's so strange, he's so lost
And you're lookin' for someone to blame, there's no fault
Now you're feelin' all this pain, there's no source
Eyes open, I can't blink right now, I can't think right now
Bartender, I need a drink right now
Pen movin' but there's not enough ink right now
Nah ship you can't sink right now

T-shirt filthy nigga, eyes lookin' like a guilty nigga
Beard look like he's a Philly nigga
Fistball like somebody tryna steal me nigga
I pour my heart out on wax, you gotta feel me nigga
And no over the counter that can heal me nigga
Gun cocked like there's some nigga tryna kill me nigga
And try whatever it is you tryna deal me nigga
'Lest they got some new shit that might grill me nigga
I pull out like break me off, peel me nigga
The games short like I owe you, bill me nigga
Unless you're a thick bitch that might appeal to me nigga
Naw don't beat me down, don't drill me nigga
I'm like really nigga, I'm too ill to these niggas
How long you think this games gonna conceal me nigga
Even if I don't scan a few milly my nigga
I fell and I got up and I'm still me nigga

Chea...
Check

I always said when I make it, there's no going back
To where the toasters clap, and we can toast to that
Them niggas hate seeing me, I'm like an open scab
I'm OT in a Cabana with an open tab
I'm in the cut though, not too many notice me
I'm strictly baritone, I play it low key
While in New York, they'll say I'm crazy like Rodman was
In Jersey, I'm what Petrović, Dražen was
Politically incorrect, Fuck being proper
Because all the faces looking real like the Fila Prada's
And it seems like they the main niggas seeing dollars
Let me get that off my chest, So I don't need a spotter
Maybe now I see why Marvin just needed to Holler
And if you know me, treat a hurdle like I'm Iguodala
Raisin' the bar, fucking with the stakes
He'll get you that type of fame that your publicist will hate
So we can get the goons involved and have the triggers squirting
But since I'm well endowed, I'll be the bigger person
Throwing darts at a Mozart, you won't go far
Trying to help kill a legend, ask Solar

Nah, this ain't something to ride to
It's more like shit you get inspired to
See I can do anything I desire to
As long as the earth's round and the sky's blue
Nigga this ain't somethin' to ride to
This is shit that you pop pills get high to
This a warrior's anthem for survival
This is Mood Muzik, that's what I do

Check it... Nah, this ain't somethin' to ride to
It's more like shit for you to survive to
Roll a blunt do whatever you decide to
To celebrate my return, I'm sorry that I deprived you
Left you with tales of quick riches, thick bitches
Small timers talking that big business is fictitious
No rhymers, slow grinders, that mo' blind us
With skills so vagina, relying on co-signers
Now they mad at me, I keep going hard repping
Cause what's a Rampage to Rashad Evans
That mouth still haul off, we'll shoot at the tires
And you ride until the wheels fall off, Check it
I spent my youth in prison
I thought to get the 401K's a nigga had to do some pitching
But now I'm growing up, they say I'm too different
They tell me I've changed, I say that you didn't


Honestly this past year's been a burden on me
Unfinished product, God is still working on me
But shout to old girl, she's never to blame
The way she swallowed had me thinking that I never came
With me at the funeral, with me at the wake
Black dress, black shades, strictly for my sake
Our little man's two, to him it's all a surprise
I can't explain death when he don't understand life/
See grandma passed, about a week before mother's day
Forgive me, I was worried about my mother Faye
Bad as it sounds, wouldn't have it any other way
She was so ill, death could have only been her escape
(Talk to 'em) and gotta mask how that make me feel (Why?)
Since the streets is only asking about a Shady deal
If I knew now what tomorrow was gonna teach me
And I told you in advance, you probably wouldn't believe me",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-somethin-to-ride-to-lyrics
Why Would I,UnKnown,UnKnown,"You can always count on me

I got no time to be wasteful, treat my time like it’s rare
I appalled at the fact that you think I got it to spare
I got so many folk, pulling me every which where
They bombard me problems, niggas think that I care
They be clogging my air but I just dismiss it
They say I’m unfair, they depend on me to fix it
They say I don’t give back, they say that I’m evil
Help yourself 'least before you expect me too
I got so many hoes, that vie for attention
I ain't saying no names, they would die for a mention
They love my sense of humour, they say I’m a clown
They say I can be insensitive but they stay around
And it’s normally a model, nigga, shocked that I got ‘em
But way before the deal, women were never a problem
Y’all judging it wrong, you think this what I offer
But it’s all in the mind, more about what I taught her
I'm so low maintenance, no Victoria Secret
All I ask is that they make the bed when they leave it
We can be in the PJ, could be at the Clearview
You talk to the pilot from your seat he can hear you
Some niggas got beef with me but I’m an adult
So it’s not I’m afraid it’s that I know the results
And the song never changes get sung from the pulpit
My time is important got none the bullshit

I don’t wanna waste your time
I got so much I could be doing with mine
Why would I waste your time
You handle your shit, I handle mine
That way it’s all good
It’s all, it’s all, it’s all good
It’s all good
That way it’s all good
It’s all, it’s all, it’s all good
It’s all good

I can show you a mansion show you some cars
It speaks in volumes that I’m showing you bars
The money means nothing you make it you lose it
Some niggas stay broke and just make up excuses
I could be out the country hiding under the bucket
Shop when I land, I ain't checking no luggage
Instead of giving it my all, I can give you a quarter
But even in that I just be giving you Slaughter
I can be at the jeweler, could be at the theatre
Can be at the strip club or can be with the Realtor
I can wanna relax and vacay with dude
I can be anywhere that means away from you
From the kid on the block, selling dope
Now I’m in VIP behind a velvet rope
I tap shawty on the shoulder, tell her to go
She say she depressed, helping her cope
I can take her to Gucci, can take her to Mike Kors
But if you had the World what would you strive for?
It’s a gift and a curse everything is a drawback
I could be in green house but nigga I’m off that
It’s the size of your heart when your facing a wall
Are you afraid of heights or afraid of the fall?
The song never changes, get sung from the pulpit
My time is important got none for the bullshit

I don’t wanna waste your time
I got so much I could be doing with mine
Why would I waste your time
You handle your shit, I handle mine
That way it’s all good
It’s all, it’s all, it’s all good
It’s all good

That's my definition of a home body
Got a Rollie in her wrist and her tone cocky
Nonetheless I only check her 'cause her dome sloppy
Gave her all that she could handle though
She put her mouth around the Wiz, something Amber Rose
Get her naked and she look like Amber Rose
I was taping the whole thing 'til the camera froze
To this day her and I remain amicable
She even let me bust first, she so mannerable, HEY!

If you really dig me how about you leave here with me?
Come on, shorty, let me know
Come on, shorty, let me know
We can do whatever, promise, ain't no pressure
Hurry, girl, I got to go
Hurry, girl, I got to go

WJBOC 101.9, and I'm your host DJ Verified rocking out with you. Doing it for the grown and sexy out there. 35 and up, 35 and up only. Call us up, we're doing a live remote from Club Deco
Call us up, 1-800-We Too Old For The Fuck Shit
We wanna talk to you, come on

What's going on in this motherfucker?
See a lot of funny looks, made me think that something's wrong in this motherfucker
If I let the milli rock, it'll be a different song in this motherfucker
Two bitches in the club, can't we all get along in this motherfucker?
Rodney King and I'm gone in this motherfucker
Grown than a motherfucker

Been thinking about you for quite some time
And you ain't seen crazy quite like mine
Nah, I've been occupied, sike, I'm lying
You know how the saying go, out of sight, out of mind
Just kidding, could tell I like you
She just moved to Queens 
Hella prideful, everything I buy two
Everything his/hers, Jemele and Michael
Should've been left, but I'm still in here
Last place she'd expect to see a millionaire go (go..)
On and on and on and
Please, baby, no Tweets, put away your phone and
Ride and moaning to five in the morning
Had to Uber on the way right at you yawning
Coma zone, Joe cologne, Jo Malone
Or the Creed bottle, same color as provolone
If it's on Don Corleone go with the throne
Still I'm the best kept secret though I'm ultra known
In the focus homes
And that much real estate like the focus homes
When the clothes is gone
How he gon' bag that? Whole approach is wrong
And she ain't the type of lady to sit in coach for long
With me as high king she take her liking
To trim and piping when the 
kitchen viking
Quite surprising the pulse of my dreams
If Father Stretch appears like Ultralight Beams
Surmised by the size of her thighs, it might seem
Dreamy eyes get wide with the life of my stream, hey
Getting all up in her guts with it
Gotta bust multiple nuts with it
That's how it sound when we together
She my queen with her crown and she down for whatever, come on

If you really dig me how about you leave here with me?
Come on, shorty, let me know
Come on, shorty, let me know
We can do whatever, promise, ain't no pressure

Role Reversal,Mood Muzik 4: A Turn 4 The Worst,2010,"Joey Talk To Em
Hoping my true motherfucker know this be the realest shit I ever wrote
It's Its That On Top Muzik
I be at the mall, walk up in the store
Glance up at the wall, pick out a few kicks
I need 11′s in these
Matter of fact while you at it bring em’ in a size six
I take shorty’s shoes off
Like here try on these J’s make sure them shits fit
But in my head it gets thick, sayin'
Joey fall back, cause that's not your kid
I don’t know you lil nigga and plus I got a son of my own
But he’s at home and the ways he's being raised I don’t really condone
Naw, cause his pops been gone, fuck it
I'll explain it to him later when he’s grown
Old enough to have a phone
Askin' why mommy hate me
And he got the sneak to call me whenever he’s alone so
You wouldn’t know it but I got a soft spot for you
See, we would shared the same obstacles
Looking from the outside may seem like you neglect him
But when he slips up and calls me dad, I correct him
I protect him, when baby girl start ventin' about you I say, respect him
And though it seems out of order
My own mistakes have turned me into your biggest supporter
Fast forward, you wouldn’t believe
How I could love like mine what I didn’t conceive
Tryin' to help him reach shit what I never achieved
Am I doin' it for him or is it my own greed cause see
Me and my baby moms, we don’t do the conversations
Son cramped in the back, two bedroom shack
With seven people livin' there just congregatin'
So when your child with me, I’m over compensatin'
I’m talkin' eight bedrooms, seven baths
My son thinkin' that’s the shit that only heaven has
Mine's gotta keep it cool, yours get to see the view
White marble around the ground, heated pool
Mine's got to go to The Y
Shit, yours just got to walk outside
And the irony of it all, and it's just sad
Is you walked away yet, I’m the step dad
And then you get on Skype, sayin' how you being, whats the word
And I be on the background listenin' like
This motherfucker here got some nerve
He says, bye Daddy, I love you
I be wantin' to snuff you but wouldn’t want him thinkin' less of you
But, he's perceptive and this shit's wild
He picks up on everything and he's just a child
So through all my resistance
I’m afraid this two-year-old can already see the difference
He sees you don’t provide when you’re capable
Why we never fix things while were still able too
So you’re annoyed, it kinda of hampers me
Get my boy, I always wanted a family
Just to greet when I get to the door
You gon' have to take the L, I can't give you yours
I’ll do all the work, you ain't gotta be bothered
You can be his dad, I'll be his father
I relate though, so I know it hurts
Got to be uncomfortable when the roles reversed",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-role-reversal-lyrics
When Thugs Cry,Def Jam Demo,UnKnown,"How can you just leave me standing
Alone in a world that's so cold
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father: too bold
Maybe I'm just like my mother
She's never satisfied
Why do we scream at each other?
This is what it sounds like
When thugs cry

Yo, first off I got a seed coming
So I won't even front like I don't need nuttin'
Depending on record sales for me to see somethin'
But if that fall back how the fuck I'm sposed to feed little Budden?
I been to jail before, I been a bum before
But a nigga ain't never had a son before
I dealt with 'caine and fire, I done banged with fighters
But I ain't never changed a diaper, I ain't ready
Ever since I signed niggas been on my back
Like, ""Mouse, what up? When I'm getting on the track?""
And so the hood hates me, figured they'd be much kinder
Like, ""Joe, congratulations, and we comin' right behind ya""
Everybody in the hood I dap
Says I'm responsible for e'erybody in the hood that raps
They don't like how I do shit, say I changed
I'm the same nigga that y'all went to high school wit'
After all these years still the same drug addict
And it's fucked up, I'm sober with them same drug habits
I still pinch, thief, con and lie
Rob, shoot, difference now is I ain't high
Cats is after me, least I got a crew to warn me
I don't like walking around with this 32 on me
Least my mans is real, least my family's there
Is it worth rap, the answer's yeah, but I don't know

How can you just leave me standing
Alone in a world that's so cold
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father: too bold
Maybe I'm just like my mother
She's never satisfied
Why do we scream at each other?
This is what it sounds like
When thugs cry

I'm a survivor, I seen darker days
A mama's boy with my father's ways
But I had to see my mom in tears when pop went to the store
For them Newports that he must ain't find in years
My little brother lives in the same state, I ain't know
Shit, I got a little brother, I didn't know that
See I was never told that
, if so
I'd of been at the door with a basketball and a Kodak
Love my baby moms to death, she don't believe that
Shit, I ain't never there for her to see that
Don't wanna lose my wiz, begging her to do this bid
Not jail, but this music shit
And I know your family hate me, but we come far
Just us against the world unarmed, me and my girlfriend
Come a time when your mind ain't right and you palm a Luger
And you get used to not being used to
I'm cool with where the Lord place me
But I hold my heat and pray I never have to take it off safety
I pray for all my niggas pitching on the curb
Jersey City'll get the recognition it deserves
I pray for my son, he'll have genes like me
Pray that he don't have to go through everything like me
Pray to God: ""Bring out the things I never knew I had in me""
The rest of my mom and dad in me (Uh huh)

How can you just leave me standing
Alone in a world that's so cold

Welcome To Real Life,Mood Muzik 4: A Turn 4 The Worst,2010,"Yo, I seen shorty on the staircase, in front of an empty beer case
Weird face, almost like he was scared straight
Like he ain't have a care in life (uh), wipin' tears from his eyes
That already appeared to have been dried
We chopped it, said he was adopted
And there's a lot of shit he just tucks in his closet (uh)
Real calm, said he'd always feel harm
And all he want to do is meet his real dad and real mom
All the nice home and clothes do is remind me (how when)
In all these years, they ain't even tried to find me
Never mind love, I feel like they never liked me
If I thought there was a God, I would ask the nigga ""why me?""
But some things you better off havin' never knew
Maybe they wanted better for you than they could ever do
You got a family, I see that you don't care for them
But love gon' always be love, no matter where it's from
What if I said your moms couldn't give birth
Contemplated leavin' Earth, 'til you brought her life worth
Whatever you goin through, could always be much worse
Don't make a mistake, mistakin' your blessings for a curse (so)
So, told dude you in the right place, right here
Can't run to your corner when life don't wanna fight fair (talk to 'em)
Things'll become quite clear
When you decide to wake up and stop havin' fantasies about a nightmare
 (oh!), yeah

They don't see, who you are
They too busy posin' (uh)
But the front won't go far
Just thank God your fantasy ain't real (welcome to real life)
Fantasy to real life
You got everything but ain't got nothin'
Fantasy to real life
You got everything but ain't got nothin'
(Welcome to real life)

Yeah, you damn right she on her high horse
She say ""don't worry 'bout hers nigga, ride yours""
Before you talk, clean your own backyard
Souped up and sought after by the athletes and rap stars (uh)
Developin' a name, creepin to fame
She quick to trade her vagina for a seat at the game
And it's so foul, she don't see the shame
In the act or the fact that she view it as an equal exchange (oh!)
But she stay with the newest on, Louboutins
Buyin' groceries with coupons, sleepin' on a futon
No self-esteem to cover her lack of confidence
She get on Twitter, retweetin' all the compliments
Pretty face, nice strut with a nice butt
Disguise of a slut, only tryin' to get wifed up
But when it's party time, she won't be a second late
Once she leaves V.I.P., it's back home to Section 8
What confused me
Is niggas tried to kick it but she come across bougie, in her best friend's jewelry
Part-time mother (but), but somethin' real shady when her
Two year old daughter much closer to the babysitter (uh)
Cry when she alone, product of a broke down home (yeah)
Won't change 'cause she already grown (talk to 'em)
Already set in her ways, no need in tryin' to help (talk to 'em)
So she'd rather find wealth before she can find herself (oh!), yeah

They don't see, who you are
They too busy posin' (yeah)
But the front won't go far (uh)
Just thank God your fantasy ain't real (welcome to real life)
Fantasy to real life
You got everything (tah) but ain't got nothin'
Fantasy to real life (uh)
You got everything but ain't got nothin' (talk to 'em)

You can be what you want
But it's too much for ya to let go
Ain't got to be somethin' else (uh)
Better off just bein' yourself
Ain't gonna get you far (never)
When you gonna wake up and deal with the real life?
The real life
(Tah, welcome to real life)

Real quick, let me introduce y'all to Maverick
Lifetime addict, who recently kicked the habit (uh)
Lookin' for a job, companies won't let him have it
'Cause there's drug and gun charges up and down his whole jacket (uh)
Constantly rejected, can't deal with the aggravation (so)
So now he scared to be honest on the application
Past caught up, 'cause every door shuts like ""sorry we can't help ya""
Then it's back home to the shelter (oh!)
Nothin' to lose, givin' up like many other minions
Pendin' his trial in the court of public opinion
'Til he got a call from a temp agency
Said they had a void, asked could he fill the vacancy? (okay)
Unlike what he appears, been employee of the month for a year (I guess)
Self doubt is related to fear
And they'll never replace him
If ya gon' catch up with your dreams, gotta be willin' to chase them (oh!), yeah

They don't see, who you are
They just see your posin'
But the front won't go far
You can turn your fantasy to real
Fantasy to real life
You got everything but ain't got nothin'
Fantasy to real life
You got everything but ain't got nothin', nothin', nothin'",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-welcome-to-real-life-lyrics

We up niggas
Internet soldiers
I hope this nigga fight better than he can diss
You lose in both arenas, home and away, you like the Knicks
They call it fucking Slaughterhouse for a reason, nigga
Joey, nigga, fell for the trap, woo
Told y'all
Uh, Joey
Nigga fell for the mouse trap
Nigga put cheese right on the mouse trap
You came right to it, dick
Look, look, look

It's like a lose-lose, already my rep ruined
How I beat dude we know will accept losin'?
""Underachiever"" was a underachiever
Almost thought you would come with the ""Ether""
I know he got niggas in his camp like, ""spaz on him,"" gassin' him
Bafflin' him, real talk, some don't wanna see ya
That Scram shit'll put both hands around ya neck
Said you better get ya head fucked from under the cleaver
I'm the one that'll beast ya
You got a gut feelin' you hot (Me?,) I think you can't stomach a fever
Can't think of why a wack nigga want it with me for
I leave my mark on you like it's one of ya features
Nigga, ask how it feel to have Maino's face
I'm way ahead man, this ain't no race, stop playin'
I'm the bomb with the pen, I'm more like a bomb with no pin
How the fuck is Saigon gonna win?
He a loss of interest, talkin' 'bout my son is senseless
So I make sure the dude can't see, smell or hear
Can't touch, can't taste, now he defenseless
'Cause ain't a bullet in this world you can bench press
Speak Tahiry, I'ma speak Austin
The one that'll suck ya dick if you flossin'
Game old bitch that everybody was tossin'
The one that you literally begged for that abortion
So we both gone wild
Said, we both love hoes and that's just our style
But Sai if you think it's different, my nigga, you goin' senile
I just kiss mine and yours is the mother of ya child, blaow
Shots peel at ya entourage
Nigga couldn't get a deal on Entourage
So like, how is it harder to be me?
If I lose in real life, but you can't even win on TV?
Me I'm probably iller, probably wit' gorillas
In ya lobby with the shotty and chinchillas, 
you a rapper or a bodybuilder?
I'll have him in the E.R
With Doc trying to put him back together like a bodybuilder
Please tell me why dude Just Blaze signed
Can't even get a bassline outta Bassline
Look at the new kid sounding stupid
Nigga, I made Just more money than you did
The nerve of the loser
Keep trying to hide weak ass bars behind the work of producers
In the word of computers, is he M.I.A
'Cause he been fell off like Yung Berg on the scooter
So him and his bas' flow need to lay low
Couple red lights will ruin his whole stage show
Then put him on my payroll
How's he the Yardfather when I'm dictating where the grave go?
Been years, he's taking L's still
Turtle couldn't help him, maybe a shell will
Don't look like a winner to me
A small meal to a pitchfork, you lookin' like dinner to me
Plus ya diss track sound like a beginner to me
Ya whole shine's like a dimmer to me, fight who, nigga?
You better know how we get it in Jerz
Velcro his tongue, hope dude stick to his word
Nigga, you'll be in an ally covered
And you don't love the kids, you just wanna make us think that you Sally Struthers
I'll pit you with the worse kind of men
Dudes who become everything they condemn
You would think that jail learned him a lesson
Until he brag about e'rything he learned in jail
Nah, I don't think his struggle was lackin'
He did a long bid, came home and had trouble adaptin'
Afraid of adulthood, has trouble relaxin'
No choices, had to try his hustle at rappin'
Here's a jewel, maybe you should put ya first disc out on Amazon
Before you go fronting when the camera on
And the poor fans kept the hope
But prison was the only place he was next to blow
So he calls me a fag like he homophobic
'Cause they had him on his knees like, ""Homo, hold it!""
Run around, be screamin', ""Oh, don't poke it""
It's a small world, how you think Joe don't know it?
Guess there's where the lies get deeper
He went in a tight end and came out a wide receiver
There's bones in ya closet that you can't hide
Fans know you went to jail, me? I know why
Sai, you ain't brollic enough
Somebody better play third wheel and try to stop the fuck
'Cause I'll put it in fifth gear
, 
like who he gon' threaten next?
Fill his whole body with metal, now he Weapon X
Had the upper hand from go
Shirt always off, how does it feel D'Angelo
To get naked like a down hooker?
My dudes outta town'll book ya
Ya whole gangsta's brown sugar
With no point to his vlog, had the world waitin'
Flexing for 10 minutes like he had a girl tape him
Just co-signed for you, said you had a classic
Now he got no time for you, wrote you off on taxes
Now he lonely, vulnerable, lookin' soft
Tried to help him, I been in his shoes, I just took 'em off
To put it simply, how can he offend me?
I can teach 'em how to live real major on an indie
So picture dude upsettin' me
Stop complaining and take control of your own fuckin' destiny
He blames radio, blames Atlantic
Craig Kalman, but I can't blame 'em, they panicked
Nobody scared he's like hockey
Retired for a minute, came back and nobody cared
So for me to take this serious, homes
Get Mook, Loaded Lux, Jin maybe Serius Jones
To help write your shit, make it brand and new
If not, look for the nation who abandoned you
Be mad at yourself and ask yourself
You know I'm a rap giant, why Plax yourself?
Dude went ahead, axed himself
He cut off his nose to spite his face, Mike Jack'd himself
Bryan, how the fuck you think lesser of me?
When you easily the lesser MC
Thought it'd be fun but that's deaded to me
This point I'm battlin' my own perception, try and beat what's expected of me
Nino Bless said you was a bull, too
But I'm in widescreen, I ain't see that full view
I know how ya ho ass felt
Make it so you can't eat, put an extra hole in that belt
Ain't a gain in site
Cocoa Chanelle ain't the only nigga that'll put a pain in his life
Dead weight, get ya head straight
Cut the track off, listen to ya thoughts, checkmate",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-pain-in-his-life-lyrics

And even that's fine, I don't mind alright
Me, I had fine my whole life
You can find that anywhere
Its about lil more than that over here
Its more than just a after-sex
Call me when you want something else
From something else

Top off, trench coat
Slow it down, switch the tempo
White wine, in slow
Curtains open, let the neighbors watch us through the window
Lights out, candle lit
I'm tryna see whats up right now
Got me open as a fuck right now
Probably why I'm tryna fuck right now
Ill take that back, its the wrong impression
But I bet you 30 minutes leave a long impression
Hair pulled, with your back arched
I ain't even gotta ask whose this is
Foolishness, you heaven sent
And its evident how you do that shit
Got a compliment, yo confidence
Cause I love how you exude that shit
Already know you the illest alive
You don't even shine to prove that shit
Call it training day, I know wifey proud of me
Told her I had a draining day, she sucked the life right out of me
My turn, gon' eat it
Turn over, but I'm tryna keep it

Can't you see that I'm gonna give you everything you want
Everything that you need
What I really feel is
Sexual healing is what I am giving you
I know that I'm a pro, girl wait
Switch positions, switch positions
I know that I'm a pro, girl wait
Switch positions
Lets do it
Tonight lets get it lusty
I wanna touch you
And if it make you my girlfriend Im gonna cuff you
Maybe we can chill all day
Ride up on the beach and now I play
What you say?
(What you say?)
What you say? What you want?
What you need? Yea you know I like that fuck
Got that fire, anything I let you have
Just sex me

Full course meal, now the dinner gone
Closet full of clothes, still nothing but the skin is on
Don't matter if its your place or my place
But if mine, the patio got a fireplace
Trust me, you ain't seen shit just yet
Not compared to how shit can get
Me on top of you dripping sweat
And that don't matter, you drippin wet
Your turn, on top
And you can crash here, just promise me you won't stop

Can't you see that I'm gonna give you everything you want
Everything that you need
What I really feel is
Sexual healing is what I am giving you
I know that I'm a pro, girl wait
Switch positions, switch positions
I know that I'm a pro, girl wait
Switch positions
Lets do it

Two rounds might lead to four
All depending on how you feel though
We suckin' on you, all while you bitin' on that pillow
Same time next week but I asked her how she feel first
Said she wanted some days off, since she needed to heal first
She told me smack her ass like she was actin up
I told her put it down, but she backed it up
Our turn, one forever
Arrive separate but come together

Can't you see that I'm gonna give you everything you want
Everything that you need
What I really feel is
Sexual healing is what I am giving you
I know that I'm a pro, girl wait
Switch positions, switch positions
I know that I'm a pro, girl wait

Ohh! Oh yeah you fuckin faggot (okay)
(Haha) You fuckin' faggot, Game
You only a replacement till' Yayo come home, nigga
Game Over nigga
This not real, only got 8 months before The 5 Hearbeat run is over nigga
Stop that singin' shit, and you better be over Faggot

Dude wanna be Dre, Ren Ice Cube or Eazy
But, you ain't them aight dude? Believe me
Your sound's type trash, Tell Banks to ghostwrite
But then you sound like Fab, get a sound like BLAT!
Not real, never heard a sound like that
He's a bitch, probly sleep in a gown and nightcap
Got a big chrome friend that I tuck along with me
And I brung that since you like +suckin on 50's+
You's not Big and Pac, not East vs. West
Nigga, this is least vs. best
Wack west nigga from a sideblock, meanwhile
Against dude that fills an iPod with just freestyles
Let's do the math
You ain't sold shit, and I sold 500K more than that
Heard your diss track,but I ain't even play on that
Because I just seen dude, and he ain't say all that
In the same hotel, if dude wanted to do me
I'd have been Cassidy, gave him the room key
Got the guns and the vest out that I planted
And Game woulda had his chest out like Janet!
That's what I mean, dude's on that tough shit
Image for the public, but live none of it
Scared to speak street cuz he scared so he dap on some love shit
Then get in the booth on some thug shit (naw)
Go and put you in a verse
Nigga, this 4 will put you in a hearse
Now the hands will put you in the dirt
Cuz guns is like soap on a rope, it took a fag to start usin' 'em first
A to the K, Gem to the Star
Wanna play Kaiser Soze, BLAM! nigga, limp to your car
This fag can't be for real, he gettin' at me?
He 'gone need more of a shield than Vic Mackie
(So) Next time don't be a coward about it
Just get loud with this crowd to show everybody you bout it
Mr G-G-G-G-G, stop that
Homes, you only known for 5 Heartbeat hooks and gettin' popped at
(c'mon"") See no evil, I hear the people
They ask and I tell 'em I got your career on TiVo
And if the song sells, and you gone be poppin' them thangs
Maybe you could tell Jimmy he can stop callin Skane
I'm just trying to save your rep
Your not a rapper, you asked, they gas like you gone save the West
I doubt that, not him
You need help, is Dre gone put him on the shelf? Better learn from Rakim
So when I see you also, we can let the Glocks blow
Come through Jersey, or I'll meet you as Roscoes
Another fake thugs gets killed
100 red dots on you if you wanna be a blood for real, mu' fucka

Yeah! And that's it man
Game fuckin' over, I ain't gone keep doin this shit back and forth
50 stop sendin' your lil' fuckin wack ass pawns
And come holla at a real nigga man
The nigga's ass, fuck him, fuck Game, fuck Banks, Buck
And any of them other niggas Curtis tryin' to send over this way
Fuck the whole mother fuckin' G-Unit, a.k.a. the mother fuckin 5 Heartbeats
Fuckin' Banks, Buck, Yayo, Game and fuckin' Curtis, the singin' ass nigga
NIGHTS LIKE THIS! haha
Fuck outta here man
You know where I'm at, and you know where to get at me, nigga
And I heard the lil slick shit in the beginning of your shit
Bout you gone punch niggas in the face and all that
You was real polite when I see you
And tell Mya I say wuddup
I'mma save that lil trick from you tryin' to holla back in this

I tried to find myself but I'se your replica
I mean I only tried to be what you never was
Tell my older brother I'm bad at being a brother
I know I never told you just how highly I think of ya
Tell my grandmother man she's always been a friend of me
I would've visited more if I wasn't in to me
Tell tre I think his mother is an ass hole
When you get older you might understand how that goes
Tell the hood I left not for greed or wealth
I did it for my own sanity to keep my health
I tried to bring a few with me hoping we can cash in
But all they said is I ain't do it in a timely fashion
Tell music she saved me when shit was adverse
My first love I'd give my life so she could have hers
Tell my friends each one they taught me how to be one
I owe to them part of everything I've become
Tell fame I ain't want it naw keep it a hundred
I tried my best to go and get it but the nigga fronted (so)
I lie dormant Living threw torment
Tell cops I got warrants I don't warrant
Tell the therapist Look I never thought I'd get here
Somebody ask love why she ain't want to live here
So in this place there's a lota pride Anybody thinking they know me
I apologize
Grandpa is 80 plus Still being strong
Tell the fake niggas keep on keeping on
Faithfully tell everybody who hated me
Basically all it ever did was motivated me
They say I'm difficult so to put it simply
Tell the world I never cared it was against me
Tell god to be there in case I fall
Tell the fans I never jipped them I always gave them my all
Tell my girl she put me threw it
But if I had to go threw it with anybody
I'm thankful it's her
Tell every member of my family
For to long I hid behind my own insanity it got me caught up
And somebody tell currency I chased him to the death
I thought I'd catch the nigga till I ran outa breath
Tell my bruises I'm fine I'm good I normally heal quick
Tell the rain come down I need to feel it
I told the nigga give me a hand but he wouldn't
I kept telling myself I can't
Until I couldn't
If niggas want to kill me tell em I already died
Tell anybody that will listen I tried
Till the water ran dry tell the water get the fuck out my eyes
Tell the crust it taste great but I'd much rather the pie
Ask success what I have to do to succeed
Then tell my twin brothers I look at them like my seeds
Ya'll with be the mouths I feed
If a nigga ever tell me how to get rid myself of some of this greed
I tell em that I'm grown really I ain't finish growing
Look tell failure I ain't want to get to know em
Tell the stick up kids to come and get me
Tell the stereotypes I tried them shits on they didn't fit me
Tell who ever I wronged I apologize
They tell me though there bumps in the road
But still I gotta ride they tell me I got a lotta pride
I tell them how the fuck you gone tell me what I got inside
Then they wanna lecture a nigga tell me life is what you make it
That's when I tell them I beg to differ",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-do-tell-lyrics
Old School Mouse,Mood Muzik 2: Can It Get Any Worse?,2005.0,"You now listenin' to a different type of boss
Abstract, they cut him from a different type of cloth
Jers say that Mouse went a different type of soft
Only started when I was lookin' at different type of lofts
Told 'em, I'm a don, show me somethin' with a pool next
And I need four bathrooms, it ain't gotta be a duplex
White tee, boots yes, see 'em in a suit next
Or somethin' European shirt lookin' like a 2X
Runnin' for the ball like I'm Plaxico Burress
Or in Cancun breakin' a back on a brunette
Gimmicks down pat like they rehearse that much
I don't respond to a sublime, it ain't hurt that much
Yea I scream out Jers that much
'Cause these other dudes fightin for New York like it's worth that much
And these sitcom niggas caress and hold bitches
To them they Golden Girls, to me, they old bitches
Chicks lookin' to G you, cons lookin' to cheat you
Owe a nigga money, you know he lookin' to see you!
Niggas lookin' to beat you
Fiends treat the hood like its Saw part two, 'cause they just lookin' for needles
I wake up grateful that I'm breathin' first
'Cause dudes'll kill you, they don't need a reason first!
These niggas'll still hit 'em
They know the hood is too poor to hire CSI, and Gil Grissom
Nowadays, gotta keep his blue steel with 'em
I know about snakes, 'cause I used to deal with 'em
Used to give my heart, used to rob, steal, with 'em
Let 'em meet mom, share my last meal with 'em
To rap now, you ain't gotta have skill with 'em
Just appeal (with 'em)...with a little rhythm
A dude has that and ready to attack y'all
You gotta kiss ass or else you get blackballed
If you don't like niggas, still give 'em dap y'all
I swear to God this hip hop shit is a trap y'all
I don't even remember how I used to act y'all
Something's wrong with the math, I know I can add y'all
I came out screamin' Desert Storm everyday
And soon as I stop, he don't wanna play
Stacks sayin' what you did for Clue, shit I just laced it
I didn't even know that dude was doin' his tape, shiiiitt
He don't want the fame no more, it's fuckin' with me
Don't hear Reasonable Doubt the same more
I can't listen to Blueprint (naaw!)
Got a resentment toward Hov', tryin' to hate on 'em, throwin' in my two cent
They say don't bite the hand that feeds you
Even if I wanted to, I can't, no teeth to
Don't get me wrong, still I love Clue and Hov'
But they both rich, so what that gotta do with Joe?!
I gotta bring home food for Joe...Trey that is...
Like, fuck why I say that shit?!
C4 why you take that shit?
But it's just how I feel, so naw, don't erase that shit
Child support's a bitch, but I take care of mine
But the law just say that I ain't there for mine
And the judge I look at (what about?)
Don't wanna hear, nor do he understand that things got pushed back
I'm sittin' here with all this anger, stop me
He's like what about this thing called a Gangsta Party?
Must think I live life like it's a Gangsta Party!
I'm 10 seconds away from a GANGSTA ROBBERY, NIGGA!!
No four leaf clover, I can't luck up
Feel like removin' the seeds and gettin' fucked up
Feelin' quick temper, somebody bound to get fucked up
I feel like everyone around me's a FUCK UP!
Ratchet on me, I'm screamin' out ""what what!""
'Bout to live life like my last buck's up
I ain't got time to run around stuck up
Not when I just seen a group of niggas gettin' stuck up
So you damn right, I'm on my grind
Look like some shit is on my mind, niggas
Need to talk, but nobody to turn to
So I go to horoscopes in the Jersey Journal
It's always somethin' bad, I don't know why I read it
Then I play it off, it's fake, I don't believe it!
Smokin' like two packs a day
Still got about five cartons stashed away
And that's just were I'm at today
I'll be in a better place if I just passed away (sike!)
Just hop in the casket and lay
That's old school Mouse, move on, put the past away",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-old-school-mouse-lyrics
Ayo,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Ever felt like the World’s on your back and you need some love say AYO
And its hard to keep your life intact while they holding you back, scream AYO
When enough is enough and it feels like
No matter what you do, nothing ever goes right
If you feel like me, let me hear you say AYO

Nah, it ain't pills
So if I ain't myself as of late then it relates to another ordeal
Don’t suggest out ya mouth that maybe I’m stressed out
Or it's God tryna test Mouse
Everything about me is changing and its new to me
I’m 29 going through a new puberty
Unusually the niggas that make moves take cues from me
And sayin' that I’m acting real foolishly
Well let me just explain my state
See I’m thinking at a whole nother rate
I hungry but I’m ordering with my eyes so there’s too much on the plate
Which means I can’t digest what I just ate
Wait, I’m bearing too much, stop me if I pop me an oxy
I’m not me, will somebody stop me or copy
And tell me calm down nigga, relax
I tell em calm down let me relapse


Yo, they telling me, the change is significant
Standing in the front but can’t see what they witnessing
I’m tryna take criminals, litigants, goon type niggas and turn em into business men
Change thinking patterns, give em business sense
Make ‘em model citizens, hang me if it’s a sin
Watch the cash come, patience I’m past
I’m tryna create demand for a girl who never had none
Be more bright, you fighting me all night
We’ll if I died tomorrow I’mma make sure you be alright
Turn students in to teachers, followers to leaders
But I strain my arm the further I try to reach it
Don’t misread it, I ain't book smart but lets stay on the same page, let me be the bookmark
I know more, I can’t take no more so I show more
I kill me so you can have anything you hope for


Ay, you ever try pulling a hat trick without magic
Shit, I’m doing outta habit, it’s outta habit
Cause I’ll flair up, high temper I’ll react quick
And go and try to fist fight a nigga without a ratchet
It’s funny, we all go and ask for wealth
But won’t none of us, ask for help
Well maybe I need to get some
And I’m like fuck giving niggas a fish
Follow me and I’mma teach you how to catch one
Still they tell me I’m delusional
But there’s other niggas under this illusion too
It’s Karma catching up and misusing dudes
I can’t think straight, look at what confusion’ll do
So I sink my knees in the floor
God musta restocked, something new gotta be in store?
I make board outta bad hand
Trust me I got an exact plan
I’m a genius not a mad man",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-ayo-lyrics

Chea, talk to em, the top
Ohhh! Jared F on the track
JOEY
It's ya man, holla at him

Now look, look, look, look
They say once you get to a certain age
At a certain point you hit a certain phase
Become hard to break out of certain ways
No matter how bad you tryin' to impersonate
So I promised, I swore
I start doin things that I ain't never done before
Going against my core, I was sure my new chore
Would be to go and see some shit that I never saw
I.E, I swore that when I left man
I'd never say another word about a Def Jam
When you look at the big picture gotta figure that
No matter right or wrong they interpret the shit as bitter
Niggggas, they don't care its what they ask me
They don't care that I just answered this shit last week
And lastly, not a thing will slip past me
And most of these gangstas is bitches, ask apache
Nigggga

Uh uh uh, never
Uh, uh, never
Uh, talk to..., never
Nuh, uh, you already know
Never again
One quarter of the Slaughter

Yo yo yo
Modern day Hercules on the track
Even if it brings me to my knees
I still put Jersey on my back
I swore id never cheat cuz as hard as it made my girl cry 
Man that day I felt my world die 
Insensitive, so if you see me going through emotion
Most the time I'm going through the motions
I swore I'd never play the hood but the CL so good
If I change my mind I'm going through it ghostin
Forgive me father, I swore I'd never lie again
But couldn't fight temptation, I had to try again
Swore I was done with vicodin 'til I changed my mind's mind
And convinced him it was harmless, just vitamins
I swore id never make another song
Contrived to conform to some shit that didn't belong
Orrrr, how about I never say never
If I start today, can't expect me to see something that far away

Nahimean? it ain't tunnel vision or nothing like that
How the fluck...
Uhhhhh, uhhh
One more 'gain
How you sposed to see nothin?
You can't!
Its, its, its that amalgam music

Yo swore I'd never respond to haters
Honestly its draining
But on the other side its entertaining
Built a shield that would never let the pain in
Armed with an alarm to notify me if it came in
And some niggas say I'm changing
So I swore to never be with them even though I agree with em
For better or for worse like a wedding
You chillin with a chameleon, I just adapt to my settings
Take a Momento, and see a man without a memory
I don't remember me, mentally or facsimile
It's just me and my alter ego
Pardon us, swore to never dumb it down but fans won't smarten up
I swore it never be another Mood Muzik
Or it'd be a while, I ain't in the mood to do it
I helped the game do away with all the trash
Never live in the past, treat everyday like its my last motherfucker

Treat everyday like its ya last one
Tomorrow's not a promise!

Ghetto Burbs,No Love Lost,2013.0,"Always had big dreams
Everybody had big dreams though
I ain't never wanna stay here, I had no intentions
I never had no plans

Live my life
Gotta know how to survive
Just can't hide
These streets eat you alive
Ghetto burbs
Cause I'm from two different worlds
Ghetto burbs
Comin' from the ghetto burbs

Ghetto burbs, I'm from the ghetto of Jerz'
From where the peddlers serve, use hand gestures for words
Big-up to LA, they was ahead of the curve
My hood we gangbang, you can get left on the curb
Yep, I was raised here, but I'm tryin' to export
Police is crooked, the strippers is escorts
Like my homie Layla, really I can't knock her
Cause she gettin' paper, month ago she was knocked up
Baby-daddy a dope-boy, fresh home he was locked up
But he on the same shit, fucked around and got shot up
In my same mind, I'm like why he even bother?
At the same time, don't know what he was a part of
Layla over the casket, tears coming harder
The hood wins again, another son with no father
Gotta take it in stride, 'round here that's the usual
But I ain't accustomed, that shit I can't get used to
I'm trying to survive


Ghetto burbs, I'm from the ghetto of Jerz'
From where the ghetto's disturbed, you can be dead in a hearse
Say a prayer daily and end it with ""better or worse""
I lost faith, but grandma still keep her head up in church
Murder rate sky-high, employment is real low
Little kid try to rap, but will he get a deal? No
Cause poverty kills slow, belief is beyond you
7 out of ever 10 bitches here got the monster
Like my little homie Tanya, I met her at Freaknik
Freak shit, the same bitch them niggas be all out in the street with
Open, in love with the service
But she got resentments you won't see from the surface
Feel like so many women look great, so she worship
Caught AIDS from rape, thought her whole life was worthless
Ho couldn't know how gorgeous her curves is
She fucking 'em raw and hope to catch it on purpose
You better survive


Ghetto burbs, I'm from the ghetto of Jerz'
I ain't tryin' to act like my part of the ghetto's the worst
Niggas is tricks here, they'll buy stilettos for birds
How did I get here? They act like the metal don't hurt
You just getting high, guess they trying to escape it
Or commit suicide assuming they couldn't take it
The streets is cold, still we run around naked
Success is a void and we replace it with hatred
That's your homie from way back, from so many years old
But friends turn green, even that acted weird old
You think he cared? No, y'all used to share clothes
Now you struggle for rent and he got ice in his earlobes
Your man won't even extend a hand, meeting all his career goals
You need a whole 'nother plan, your career's froze
Valuables are more valuable
Than everything even value to dude
Cause you gotta survive


Coming from this ghetto burb
Coming from the ghetto babe
Gotta know how to survive, streets eat you alive
Coming from the ghetto burbs
Said the streets eat you alive, alive, yeah",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-ghetto-burbs-lyrics
I Want You Back,Mood Muzik: The Worst of Joe Budden,2003.0,"Let's go back to nine seven, seventeen though I looked like 20
And I was poor, I didn't look like money
Then I saw someone I thought who was mature, looked like she would shun me
And inside its like my pride had been took right from me
She loves to dance, dancin in the middle of the floor
So I thought I better get to her before
Other guys start to notice she was fly, had a brother goin wild
Tryna leave the club with the future mother of my child
(man) I can't believe it
Nice ass and cleavage
She's 23, she's somebody I can see me with
2 weeks pass, now I'm gettin wit her
3 weeks pass, I'm livin wit her
5 weeks pass, now I'm in love I'm so glad that I met her
She's dedicating love songs Brandy ""Have You Ever""
Have you ever had it bad but just a fad
It wouldn't last forever but still just like

Moms don't like her, but she adores me
Struggling artist, no job, she supports me
So alone, my only friend is boo
So when its me against the world, the world gotta be against her too
In a year we was homeless, stuck on the street together
Starvin, nothin to eat together
Times get hard, the fightin and the bickering starts
And now she's throwin in my face about how I can't get a job
Now she pregnant, another mouth to feed, add that on
Nah the condom ain't break, I ain't had that on
Tryna be a man, I went and got a job at 'the wiz'
Chill Angie, I ain't got the right job for a kid
Can't keep it, now she heated but we don't live lavish
It's a good thing you had that miscarriage
Cause I'm against killin kids but I'da did it
I was wit it, she's spoiled it, I'm 19 lookin at my bloody son in the toilet (damn)
We beefin, she likes to bring up old things
And anytime we beef, she likes to throw things
But that knife, I couldn't dodge it
But my love was too strong so after surgery I dropped them charges
She said I beat her bad, I took her by her feet and dragged
To this day I don't believe that fact
Can't see her bein heated and desertin me freely
I know you hurtin, it ain't workin I know you wanna leave me BUT

After all the court cases, blame is in order
She's scared of me, hence the restraining order
Had to break up but we made up, family mad at us too
Lets have a baby and then maybe they'll be havin a truce
She actin rude, havin her moods
Screamin ""I'm pregnant"", like that's an excuse
Angie I ain't tryna hear you now
I had to bounce, I can't be there for you but I'll be there for the child
TRE! they had to cut mommy phoned me to clutch you
She was drugged up still screamin ""Joey I love you""
Months passed, here come the cops again
She threw my clothes up out the window
And I end up in the building on the cot again
Naw not again
I see that she's my baby mother but she's not my friend
That was the last straw, it was apparent
We ain't workin as a couple but lets see if we can work as parents
TRE! you know that mommy used to use you against me
But she got a little better, she don't use you to tempt me
See me on TV now things got better
She's says I'm not the same man that I was when I met her
She don't like Joe Budden, leave that for the public
She want the same guy that she fell in love wit
If she could ever turn it back to like the past
That's all she ask when she prayin
If I came at her like ""I'm back"" I know that all she'll be sayin is..",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-i-want-you-back-lyrics

Is clear that the vision of some of these vets blurry
No shot at putting season in back with Steph Curry
Wait, some of y'all still doubt fam
I get a chick to do whatever I want without bands
Cars foreign, but the .45 from the block
So would've recognized you and go and hide from the cops
Hay makers for these great debaters and naysayers

And we a man suicide away for proving that

Way back, Emmitt still had Troy and Dallas with him
Before Pusha T lived good, still had malice in him
Lose some and you win some

If there's a price on my head I'll discount it if you looking to buy
This ain't the day to play, catch 'em face to face
Then surround them with chrome
And give them every chapter from 50 Shades of Grey

It's Joey
Slaughterhouse
Check me out now, look (it's that On Top music!)

Psychotic is what they call you, ignore you going by my logic
That allure’ll secure you looking through my optics
Yet and still put a pill in front of me, I'd pop it
Tried to stop it but couldn't look at my eye sockets
My God it makes me skyrocket
Realest to ever do it, you can believe that shit if I jot it
And if you couldn't tell I'm on my own time
Prisoner of my own mind, problem is I don't mind
Niggas askin' what I deem as success
Life's a bitch, I'm just lookin' up her dress, I could give a fuck less
All of a sudden they see me on Joe Budden TV and I'm goin' national
But they judge me and that's a broken gavel
Shocking to me how quickly niggas will go and bash you
Never had withdrawals, pitfalls, what coke and hash do
Never stood in place while everyone was going past you
Keep your opinion to yourself nigga no one asked you
Get used to me, far from what I used to be
Provided, still throw you aside if you not of use to me
Self-destructive I love it anything that abuses me amuses me
I just hope the whole world excuses me
Hip-Hop got him under all types of scrutiny
I think that the shit's dead neck into noose to me
Wholeheartedly don't want no part of what's a part of me
Moving lethargically still I dare a nigga to spar with me
What I aspire to be never inspired me
Big fan of karma, catch twenty-two's, irony
Y'all don't understand the types of demons that's inside of me
Rebel with a cause if I do it it's done defiantly
Raged looking for the machine aiming a Ruger
Old soul I don't fuck with the young'ns I ain't a cougar
Say a prayer for the losers aware of intruders
Everybody around me like the hair on Medusa
And so its time to make a move, exit
Rubber-band covering the bruise, left wrist
Faith in the man I can't prove, exist
I really got nothing to lose but a death wish
I ain't worried about jewels and a necklace
Me I live life shrewd, reckless
Nigga I ignore the rules and the message
Walk away from the shit smooth with a peck kiss
Y'all ain't hearing me, no fear in me
Only nigga brave enough to conspire against a conspiracy
Y'all want to be sick, get a MRI and mirror me
But minus any streaks not a peak gon be clear as me

Since they hopping on the same page, wait
Lemme go and write a new book, yeah
Let me show them what we 'bout Royce
Let me show them what we do Crook
They was under the impression we was underground, nah
We don’t do the spotlight and gimmicks
Dudes y'all listen to don't be getting it in
So I snatched every nigga that they mimicked
Authentic, y’all call it a clinic
Y’all race against time but I'm winded
Hip-hop’s son, Kool Herc's descendent (?)
Nah, nigga, never cared who we offended
'Cause they told me I’d be dead by now
Told me I was sick, I’m on meds right now
Shit’s pitiful, I’m lyrical, bitch, in the booth, nigga probably getting head right now
I wish it was a window
To what my mind be brewin’
Y’all pop the bottles or wine cooler
Either way don’t interrupt what I’m doin’
It's my tune it don't pertain to you
It’s not obtainable, this rhyme schooling
So after my latest should be labelled the greatest
And even if I’m not I’m signed to him
Always thought I only had to be myself though
All that ever got a nigga was the shelf though
Built my own legacy without help though
So now I need more room than just elbow
Now the angst is building and the buzz is high, shit is long awaited
Even though I run the risk of having songs be dated
Before I ever conform I’ll be constipated
What I mean I can easily pop off
Sell out and get the whole world to talk 'bout
I’d be rich right, but it wouldn’t sit right
So I hold my own shit before it’s forced out
Every line would be about pulling a Hawk out
Not me, can’t help 'em lower the bar
Label heads keep callin', they know I’m a star
Fuck the charts, I’d rather take over their hearts
Got paper just as long
Got a couple of fags that doubted, I don’t brag about it
I was raised to think that that’s wrong
Surrounded by thick strippers who don’t get the picture
As they poppin’ it to that song
But I’ll put a million worth in your brain
Before I put a single one in that thong
Maybe I’m just fabricating myself
Maybe I’m a sucker for some ass and some hips like that
Powerful enough to set you up with a career
Spiteful enough to snatch it right back
Man enough to never care what other folks think
Tell a chick pack up get done with the hood
But this new lifestyle so foreign to her, her new name Ms Understood
Built my own legacy know it’s fan made
Thousand dollar shades on, hand made
When it comes to pain, no they can’t aid
Maybe it’ll be a temporary band aid
Cause I came in blind to it all
Then I learned the game’s designed for you to fall
I don’t mind it at all, eating my ribs
Good meal, cause I stay prime through it all
I can tell from the whispering that these haters got it so wrong
Thinking bout my currency the only worry I see is which balcony to smoke on
And I know it hurts to hear a nigga persevere kind of man know how to stay strong
Just gotta shake the dice up and throw them shits without a care which side they land on
You’re hearing a legend, a leader
Still brought to you by Kevin and Lyor
Cig lit in the bed with my feet up
Mislead if you think you can keep up
At this point it’s the have’s against the have not’s
Nah we won’t ever share the same views, got different bread
Nigga the same dude has got different ones, went to the same school
The same folks, the same hoes
So it’s clear to me could be blurry to you
In the same regard they got the same heart
And I been there with you, in a hurry to do
We don’t move at the same speed, nah
Probably thinking I’ma cheat code
Unparalleled, it’s called beast mode
Had my real nigga ethics, G code",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-mood-muzik-the-box-set-intro-lyrics

Un4Given,Mood Muzik 3: The Album,UnKnown,"What I've felt what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be, never see
Won't see what might have been
What I've felt what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never free never me
So I dub thee un4given

Let's talk about the struggle, let's talk about the pain
Some people say they love you, but that don't mean a thang
Some folks is so naive, not me, I go insane
Some people dap you, they hug you, they do it all in vain
That's my depression talking, maybe it's really real
Maybe them doctors was right, and maybe I'm really ill
See I can't really chill without feeling the guilt of me
Stealing these pills, is anybody feeling me still? (Shit)
Except for the hood, nobody told me, I ever could, instead I pushed
Back when they told me I never would, looking at me, like I was just a crook
I express the hood and what I see on the daily
My scenery daily task force B&E's daily
A task y'all, being me daily they want to put, 3 in me nail me
This is stuff you only read in The Daily
Had product, but ain't supply it then, high off more than weed
So the product just got me higher then, product of my environment
Look at where they put me, and look where they telling me I gotta be
Stop and see, the robberies, the poverty naw fam, its not for me
It's got to be, an opt at least without dudes getting chased by police
So they gave us film, sports, and the gift to make a hot CD
Back to the wall, against the ropes nothings believable, feasible
They don't believe in you, you've been verbally beaten to
A pulp, so the result to you think nothing is reachable
Reasonable, I tell you dreams come true yeah haters, even you


Now take your hands, and wave 'em high, they told me I can't, but I said, ""Why?!""
Like, fuck it, I'll try not fuck it and die
See, this is real emotion we deal wit' often, and don't reveal it
Often we stuff it inside, but I'm like, ""Fuck it, let's ride""
I do what I do, because I do what I do what I feel
They do what they do, in hopes of what they do may appeal
They got a image and persona that they gotta fill
That they better do, for revenue, so labels will be thrilled
Kind-of-feel like a wanted man
I can't talk to folk 'cause when I ask 'em to trust me, all they wanna do is judge me, I'm feeling like they don't understand
I'm feeling like ain't too many people friendly
I feel like ain't too many people are what they pretend to be 'cause I'm in that zone, I feel alone like everybody is against me
Just feel like I'm worst enemy, and naw, its not a cry for no sympathy
I'm just thinking out loud to a crowd, I'm just trying to figure out some remedy
Almost like every lesson, it's like every jewel, every tool that's ever been lent to me
But the moment is gone, I'm like a new born I feel like a man with no memory
Slow it down for a second, make sure I'm not losing you
Or confusing you
I'm delusional, if you never been there, then you have no idea what illusions do
Through and through, I'm hoping these signs ain't vital
Or none of these rhymes inside the recital
Why do it mean, I'm suicidal? I ain't that Houston dude
But I'm a maniac
Don't get over, drunk or sober, this the same way I'd act
And I'm striving to pull together, but at least until these voices inside of me
Go forever, be alarmed I'm liable to do whatever",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-un4given-lyrics
Invisible Man,Mood Muzik Vol. 3.5 ,2007.0,"Can anybody out there hear me?
I feel like my voice is lost
Cause I know the whole World can't see me
Close to just fallin' off
But with everything I am, I still find a way to stand an' keep movin'
While I'm here so strong and still... like I'm invisible

When I'm alone in my room, sometimes I stare at the wall
With the phone off, now I'll withdrawal
Gotta' paranoia problem so I'm known ta' keep a trigger roun' y'all
BIG told me they'd be prayin' for a nigga downfall
I'm vacationin' on a beach wit' no sand (and...)
Try'nna check the time on a clock wit' no hands (what else?)
Feel like I'm gettin' close, but I'm nowhere near it
I touch it but don't feel, listen but don't hear it
Starin' out a project window under mad stresses
Me and my mental got two different addresses
One's national, Trump International, rational -
One is still stuck on the avenue
If you don't understand, fine
My body's playin' Heinz wit' the mind
Try'nna escape a landmine
Revamped, designs I search but can't find
Recant times when the future was a tan line
Damn, shit was much brighter then
Now it's just vitamins mixed in with Vicodin
If they gonna set'chu up to lose, why try ta' win?
Cause a scar don't stop nuttin' on a Vikin's skin
So niggas can come after me -
Even Intelligent Hoodlums (they) become tragedies
I move in silence - the Jadakiss of Jers. (why?)
So when it comes to Benjamins I don't say a word, ya heard?

Can anybody out there hear me?
I feel like my voice is lost
Cause I know the whole World can't see me
Close to just fallin' off
But with everything I am, I still find a way to stand an' keep movin'
While I'm here so strong it's still... like I'm invisible

See, I can can crawl into Cufflinks
Step-out, tear down a party in the club scene
But I think it's obscene
The lifestyles of the rich and shameless
I'd pick anonymity over being famous
From the start, even if they don't see it, I play a part
Rather than sell a record, rather do it from the heart
I'd rather put me before y'all
I know niggas might call it ""selfcentered"" -
I call that bein' smart
So I stand behind mics
Not even worried 'bout the lime light
That'll manifest when the time's right
If I was Kanye, I wouldn't have these problems (but then...)
But then I'd have Kanye's problems
Blessed wit' ay'thing they ever fronted on a planet
But lose the only thing I ever wanted on the planet
Back on the canvas, just lost my bandwidth
Granted, I'mma always counter, grant it
I been where you try'nna go, the God said it
So iggin' me's not strongminded, it's hardheaded
Thought I was on the right route, tacklin' the game
'Till they handcuffed my mouth, put the shackles on my brain
Popular stranger, gone, but still here
Handicap my career, I'll put it in a wheelchair
Let's keep the deal fair, nuttin' but real here (so!)
Amazed after all these years, I still care. It's weird...

Can anybody out there hear me?
I feel like my voice is lost
Cause I know the whole World can't see me
Close to just fallin' off
But with everything I am, I still find a way to stand an' keep movin'

Mic check, mic check
Ye'... y'all know who it is. Ta-ha
Oh! Uh. Uh-uh-uh
It's... it's... it's that on top music!
Look, come an' cruise wit' me
I'm good in any hood, no matter who's wit' me
My mind on gettin' money, bumpin' new 50
Or my mind was off music, 'till Clue hit me
An' told me keep it on the booth strictly
So I step in, watchin' my surroundings and my settin'
Then I let the Percocet set in
Rough year, lost five of my homeboys
I ain't worried 'bout it, y'all alive, just home boy
I feel like I'm the last real nigga left, or...
Or maybe all the real niggas just left
We growin' extinct, we like Dinosaurs
There's only a few exceptions, so minus y'all
The greatest rapper alive, is wearin' suits and ties
So you got a buncha' whack niggas sayin' they him
Used to be if you strive for so somethin' you could achieve it
Now just say shit, these niggas'll believe it
I'm done screamin' out Jump Off rules
Lost my girl, broke all of my Jump Off rules
Kept fu'ckin' the side chick, so a nigga lied more
Picked 'er up in the womans car, that I ride for
Creepin', I would hide more
Got confused as to who I'm 'sposed to fight for
I can't even blame the jump, it was my fault
Cause I gave 'er the gun and she killed the only bi'tch I would die for
So the noise is calt' for
When you goin' through Ts type of Pain -
Dawg, ya voice gets altered
Know it's hard to stay calm
Goin' need State Farm
When you fu'ckin' with a con
No, not Akon. (Let's go!)
I'm high off life, a walkin' napalm
Fastballs comin' at 'em from a Dice-K arm!
Ridin' suspended L
No wonder I'm on fire, I already been through Hell
So... when the the World's against you well...
Naw, I never snitch, but I'll let the pencil tell
I suffer from wrong thinkin' (so?)
So I avoid straightjackets
And the bi'tch that dumped Sean Kingston. (Hmmm)
Better they respect'chu then to fear you
I learnt' that starin' at the World in my rear view
But come get me, cocksucker I dare you
Rather box a felon than a nigga that's fearful. (Understand some'...)
Want a clear view, wit'out a clear view
I put the wall up but thoughts just tear through
God, I hear you, givin' me a earful (but...)
But I'mma cruise in 5th gear until I'm near you. (Oh!)
Eye of a Tiger, naw, a Sniper wit' great aim
I won't be another great slain. (Nigga!)
Takes planes, embrace pain
Ask Eddie Griffin -
You gun lose gon' lose everytime goin' up against a freight train
Niggas bleed like us, we in the same World
Keep the Patron comin' try an' make the day hurl
It's a few niggas checkin' out my chain pearls
Go ahead, try' an lift somethin' that'chu can't curl!
Far from Wayne's World
If life's a bi'tch, it ain't just R. Kelly an' Ush' fu'ckin' the Same Girl (nope!)
OG swag, walk gotta' limp in it
It's my World, everybody's payin' rent in it
I left Jers. see I took flight on 'em
Dudes tried ta' take the crown, (dawg...) didn't look right on 'em (naw!)
How you gon' fu'ck wit' a crook, heist want 'em
Play Vanilla Ice, I get Suge Knight on 'em!
Meanest Porsches, gleamin' crosses
Came from Queens to restore this
Deemed it in orbit
When the red carpet rolled out, that mean it's bosses
Don't get it fu'cked up, we had fiends before this
My third-eye sharp, so keen it's gorgeous (oh)
I've seen it all, even Halloween in August (talk to 'em!)
Gun in my hand
The game used to make you sell ya soul -
Now it gotta' come wit' a dance

{*clears throat*}
Ladies and gentlemen
I'd like to welcome everybody
Please take your seats
Please be seated
We have a great show lined up for everybody tonight
Special guest in the house tonight
Joe Budden, J.Cardim
Let's...GO

A wise man said we all wear a mask
At times keepin it on is too much of a task
Your face on the net, and your life's on blast
It might slip off, you gotta give me a pass
Sometimes I feel like a man again
But how they dress me don't make me the man I am
Nah the woes dont hamper him
They just lookin' at the clothes on a mannequin

Look, look, look
I want the best cars and the best flow
I want the best broads thats how that go
[I mean I want to be a star and collect dough
But even if I had it all it'd be just for show]
I want the diamonds to make my neck glow 
Lust for the next ho a love will never let go 
I want to run along from my shortcomings 
But I smoke so my breath gonna be short running 
I want to be in control, hands on
If I'm the pilot then we will never land wrong 
But I want to have faith, stayin' strong
Take the first step when I ain't got a leg to stand on
I got a lot to give but I want more
With numb thoughts, positive but I'm unsure
On the misplace, getaway and its disarray
And yall don't know the man just what he put on display 


I'm too annoyed to cope, tryna make a livin
Given I dont think that being a dope boy is dope
Out of every story, only 2 end in glory
Who am I to think I'm different than every hustler before me?
If I took my anger, became a gangbanger
I would aim to aim my anger at every stranger
Shawty wanna leave, honestly I can't blame her
Say the ones you love the most are always in the most danger
I talk a little slower so you have to hear
Dead man walkin, no tatted tears
Or realest to ever do it, cavalier
Hundred thousand dollar car, with rabbit ears
I don't welcome change even if it help 'em gain
Fuck a handout, I'd rather be self contained
L.V. everything, lookin' well arranged
Y'all would never know that I'm practicing self restraint


I been different, never mind I'm just indifferent
Ain't an old timer that would blame it on a skin pigment
Is it my imagination or a slim figment?
Origins ig'nant, probably why im indignant
Look at haters like 'why is it an issue?'
Is it because I'm sober but I'm on a high they can't get to?
God that was rid'culed fightin with his pride and his pit'ful
Guide I was lied as a kid too
Cursin' God out ""why he decide to pick dude?""
I big bulls but when I try its abyssmal
Die and keepin everythin inside me a riddle
But they blinded by the condo size and it's sick view
Whys, try and answer the whys
What good is havin eyes when everything you look at you despise? [can
Anybody hear me?]
Or do you need ears when you dont believe anything you hear?
Maybe it's just something in the air",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-clothes-on-a-mannequin-lyrics
Ransom Note,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Everybody's a killer but everybody's alive
When shots pop off everybody won't survive
Its obvious who will prevail if we collide
So I ain't beefin with Ran, he's beefin with his pride
Killin him inside, wanna box then I son him
Six years on mixtapes and Koch dont want him
Say your fingers on a trigga nigga pull it then
Instead of beggin for bread on these myspace bulletins
Whoa, might put him with the fishes and the lobsters
You online talkin to my bitches' imposters
Talkin' bout my baby moms and son won't help
This brother need a beatin, Im takin off my belt
Call the king a sidekick, thats suicide with the quickness
Gotta kill my own dog, thats Mike Vick shit
Your girl home sufferin from light sickness
Cause you couldn't take care of your daughter like Wick did
I love Hitch flow, think it compliments yours
Now, only yes men compliment yours
When you was A-team, they said you was trash dookie
Take it from your own squad nigga, ask Pookie
I'm looking at Randy like he a act movie
Some JC heads might wanna lash and do me
But shit was outta order when I came across the border
As a foreigner and hit the homerun like Matsui
This is pointless beef for the retarded kids
The nigga can't even tell you why he started the shit
I mean he can't make a record
The tapes comin out that nobody care about, you can't see that he desperate
The fans can easily solve my shit
If yall cop his tape, maybe he'll hop off my dick
Wanna be hard so bad, no identity left
So he run around committing identity theft
See the kid is confused
The nigga used to work at Home Depot, maybe thats why he spittin bout tools
You ain't hustlin on the steps
Before rap you was in culinary arts, hustlin to be a chef
Come on stop lyin Ran
You never been good with weight, you good with fryin pans
You not grimey you dirty, how long you think you gon rep Jersey
You not 25 you 30
And I ain't gettin shit outta this, I should stop it
But Tony Romo niggas stay gettin outta pocket
I won't cause ya goons harm I already see you tryna get me mad dog cuz his buzz like Boons Farm
I been in JC Since '92
They was the only niggas I could kick rhymes to
Before everybody wanted a label to sign to
You must got me f*cked up thinking im you!
See I ain't have no cash
I was learning from chaos, medicine cabinet and low cash
Sayin I can't come back is the worst rhyme
I was there when Jay Brown changed his name the first time
So now I gotta give lessons bout Jersey
Before wetland everything was 7 30 dog
You the fraud you tryna be hard, I was there when the feds kept chasin after shard
Not westside union, I live with bizzike
Went to st anthony's to go and check big ike
You think you cool wit niggas you say wassup to'em
Difference between us is I grew up wit'em
Rappin's my duty, I admired a newbie, I first meet deon sellin dude my uzi
And it worked out, he had beef and I was broke
But I never cocked it so I ain't see that it was broke
You a joke, watchu wanna keep talkin bout those guys dog
I ain't mad I risked my life for 0-5
You and Meedah fly you spit verses
I took him to the studio so he could lay his first shit
So you right, these young niggas dont know me
But do your homework, go ask a few OG's
Me and you see the hood way different
You glorify it, im horrified of it
Dont be stupid all your life Ran, be clear
I fuck with cats from the hood that wanna leave there
And this is when I know I heard it all;
His stupid ass proud to live on the third floor
He like ""Im in the hood all day, I gets it poppin''
You WHACK MOTHERFUCKER, you dont have another option
Talkin bout the city hate Mouse, are you serious?
We go through that once a month, its the new period
Nothin about you's tough, to say the least
Your fans think you a beast, I think you a feast
Keep lightin up the match, but he dont get hot
Scream Webb and Nitty name so he dont get shot
We both unsigned, you hate it, im loving it
Im busy, you bored, you beat, im coveted
Who believes him? bad enough his flows not seasoned
And when you came at Joe, the shit weakened
Push him off the deep end, how the fucks we even?
Your career fell bout short as a great weekend
At fight night, im in vegas when you wanna be
The only time you sit ring-side is on Tonellee
So much drama in the NYC
Liftin weights tryna fit in them skin tight tee's
And ya disses feel like they full of bitterness, anger
Cue the violins Miri Ben Ari
No one asked ya man Dread bout the toys in ya house
You Dougie Fresh'n it just makin noise wit ya mouth
Tell me how I'm a hater, nah I rhyme greater
Next to me you'll always be the denominator
Look I'm too fearless, thought I had a good understandin of who my peers is
Till you pulled this weird shit, careless
Put ya name in some good use, hold ya music for ransom cause we don't wanna hear it
Maybe you never heard Joe Budden music
You can't use my life in a diss it's just useless
So that secret shit you spoke about in a song
Nigga go and download, Where Did It Go Wrong
You can't ride no more like warn tires
You can go to Southern Cal right now to get on fire
Think, if I'm the label, why hire you?
Nothin even pops up when I limewire dude
This nigga's not a thug nevermind what I say
Ask anybody went to Club Spa on Friday
When you tryna succeed, how you a dope boy?
Couldn't support ya own habit I was buyin ya weed
I mean, but how dare niggas talk about the Game beef
When it was off wax, nigga that was gang beef
On Top the only one's that would entertain beef
Yall said he talkin about you Joe, that ain't me
So get lost all that gangsta shit soft
Even all ya songs wit features ain't piff dawg
What you do but go and get out shined by Rick Ross
When you gonna learn I'm the wrong one to piss off
You could put the mic down you don't want trouble fag
The chrome 50 put his brains in a duffle bag
He ain't a killa tell him show you all the hammers
Think he a gorilla tell him show you the bananas
Dawg, nigga came out look like a spartan
But keep gettin smoked, now he lookin like a carton
Cause I'll put the bars in just to create a margin
FUCK prime time he ain't ready for the sparrin
Us in the same weight class is mind bogglin
You goin at full speed while I'm joggin
Tryna get rich live young made and handsome
You'll go down as just another unpaid ransom
A few things in life that you ain't learn
And a few stripes out there that you ain't earn
Like you think niggas love you, think dudes respect you",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-ransom-note-lyrics

You'll be questionin' life after

Seems like ""yeah"", seems quite clear
But these maggots take your dream and make it a nightmare
You been waitin' for some years
But everything is fake, it's like a rear view mirror, nothin' is as it appears
Can't trust people cause it's all about tryina succeed
It's all about the backstabbin' and greed
It's all about the wrong things
Sucks, it's all useless
And it starts to interfere with your love for the music (Damn!)
Catch 22, most dudes'll give it all for their shot
For most niggas, this is all we got
Should you quit the whole thing?
Cause it's enough bullshit in the whole thing
To almost make you wanna kiss the whole thing...(Chea!)
Goodbye

So long, goodbye
Tired, of the game
Let's get there

Sometimes you think you better off with that 9 to 5
Til you remember all the times you got fired
Sometimes you wanna dress down, walk out with no jewelry (But!)
But you can't, you under real heavy scrutiny
You ain't got a truck that's hooked up with rims
Kids'll see you like ""damn, why I looked up to him?""
It makes some wanna quit, it makes some stand tall
If you don't sign that autograph, then it's one fan lost
Sometimes you don't feel like it
Everybody wanna be on you
Sometimes you just wanna be normal
Want the afore-mentioned
Sometimes you don't wanna be mentioned
Sometimes you just wanna blend in
Might think the statement's weird
When the world'll trade for your life (On some..)
Real shit I'll trade for theirs
Tell me now what's the answer
When they know you had a death in the family
And you still gotta smile for the camera
You thought everything would be all to the good
You ain't got as much money as you thought you would (Didn't blow!)
Some people sell out, fuck everything they shot
From their heart for that number one spot on the charts
That's what it is, I can't paint it no clearer
How you 'sposed to see straight when it's all smoke and mirrors?
(All smoke and mirrors)
Quit the whole thing, cause it's enough bullshit in the whole thing
To almost make you wanna kiss the whole thing...(Chea!)
Goodbye

Arrivederci!

Just when you think you wanna go on without the hype
Is when you go to do a show and see the crowd so hyped (And the...)
Die hard fans say ""you changed my whole life""
So I sacrifice mine and gratify you with the rhymes (Yeah!)
Folks from the hood, that see you as a stand out
Outweigh the niggas in the hood with their hand out
And goin' 5 days a week with no sleep's
A lot better than a cold park bench with no sheets
So fuck politics, fuck innuendo (Oh!)
Cause you never seen a dropout so influential
Quit the whole thing, cause it's enough bullshit in the whole thing
It's my choice so I'm with the whole thing (Chea!)
Like ""what""",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-so-long-goodbye-lyrics
Keep On,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Locks off the door, beast outta the cage
You know y'all done fucked up
Should've never let me escape
They say Joey, where you been
I tell em' I never left
Know my bed stay made, lil' homie I never rest
I keep on, I keep on, I keep on, I keep on
Now, now, now, I keep on, I keep on, I keep on

Streets still talkin'
I know blocks keep collidin'
Why my stock keep risin'
Y'all know I'ma keep riding till the wheels fall off
I don't trust a nigga, never, I'll be thugging it forever
And keep it tucked for whatever
Just, Run DMC'ing it, tougher than the leather
For the survivors in Haiti that was tougher than the weather
So, pray to God keep me safe from my travels
As I look at pictures of bloody bodies layin' in gravel
I see pain is a given
Got a better job and now the whole city hate me
I'm Lane Kiffin and the game is different
While my new bitch get on top, and ride out wit just the tip in
And stupid me be laying there trippin'
You think you on my mind then you insane or sniffin'
It ain't how I'm living, still on my same mission
While you Americans idolize lames dancing around
With their pants on the ground, me, I'm branding the sound
They old and washed up, Larry Holmes
So I usher in the new year screamin' Daddy's home
I seen artists fail thinking they would blow up
I seen niggas cry wolf thinking they wouldn't show up
Might, wonder what I scream Jersey for
Tryna show em' Jersey's more than Jersey Shore
Stealing cars, smoking herb
Won't stop till every deaf ear comprehends my spoken word, ya heard


Off rap it's a whole 'nother genre, a whole 'nother drama
A whole 'nother muh'fuckin' monster
Tryna get through to the masses
A lot bullshit out there, gotta shift through the traffic
I'm on my J. Cole, J. Elec, Blu, Grafh shit
Since my autobiographic might be too graphic for you to grasp it
Me, I know the diff-er-ence
So I perfer the hate, if they only gon' love me when I'm ig-nor-ant
You niggas is so hollow
Drake got hot, now y'all so big on Mascato
Blinds leadin' the blind
Who the fuck you supposed to follow
Keep up my full throttle, modern day Aristotle
So in scripted, prolly ain't meant for you to get it
More like encrypted, or need to be sent to ballistics
Not for dimwitted, it won't pop up in the statistics
Rebel in my own right, could give a fuck about logistics
Be advised, I ain't tryna silence any critics
Cause, the louder they talk, the prouder I walk
It's like it's a rappers job to lie, how they all ballin'
Some only got two one's on em', Jamal Crawford
Who spit hard as me? Very few arguably
Blogs wan' target me, I'm quick to they archery
Tell the labels Best in the World is how you market me
Lost my liquor license, bums won't get a bar from me
Far as birds, how I get them to the Telly maybe
Have em' on E, ask em' if they been to Chelsea Lately
Fuck Morton's, I take em' to the deli maybe
Should'a known she'd had me up and comin'
I ain't wealthy baby
Put it in layman's terms, way simple
Coming for my old spot back, Jay Leno
And not to let off a shot, but I'm better than hot

#1,Joe Budden,2003.0,"Joey! Let's go!

Back in the days before your present
Back when it was a little more pleasant
Before I knew this rap shit would ever lure me in
Let's go back like Mike Fox in the Delorean
Back in the day shit, back to the basics
When brass knuckles used to leave a nigga face ticked
Its back to the Diadoras and the Asics
It's back to the New Edition and The Take 6

""I'm number one—one—one—one""
Damn it feels good to see hip-hop say it's #1

Let's go!
Way back if you able to do the math, yeah
I'm talkin' bout the cool table in the cafe, yeah
When the strip was introduced to pedico
Commodore 64 and Coleco
Not back to Cali, back to the valley
Back to Dapper Dan y'all, back to Bally's
Back before Boomerang, Strange'
Before Zhané and go a little further back to Kwame
Damn, we came a long way

""I'm number one—one—one—one""
Damn it feels good to see hip-hop say it's #1

I remember break dancing cardboards and backflips
The royal blue and the orange Patricks
Wasn't like you homo suckas
I had the low top Converses, I could change my logo's color
I remember way back when every clan was stylin'
Flava Flav clocks and X-Clan medallions
In class see a girl you glance at her
Pass her a note, do you like me? Circle a answer

""I'm number one—one—one—one""
Damn it feels good to see hip-hop say it's #1

Winters not the best time 
warm it up Kane had came through
The eight ball jackets and Columbia Rain suits
We ain't pay minds to the length of our chains
Transformers was a dance 
Decepticons was a gang
Y'all I'm talkin bout sheep skins
Talkin' bout wearin' two pair of jeans when moms gave me a beatin'
After school three o'clock we was able to fight
Park dibs y'all two turn tables and mike like

""I'm number one—one—one—one""
Damn it feels good to see hip-hop say it's #1

What about when Public Enemy came out and they dropped a classic
Or the Pee-Wee Herman and the Roger Rabbit
And the nerds took our tests and they passed em for us
Back to the roof top back to latin quarters
The olds school's new school now it's the same ol'
It's back to Filas, gazelles and Kangols
It's back to 40 ounces back to OE
Not back to rope chains but back to gold teeth
I was the class clown just snapping at cats
Let's go back to the (?) with the matching hats
Remember the Real Roxanne, remember all the vets
Remember Kool Moe Dee remember Lord Finesse
I bumped Run-D.M.C. almost every weekend
The Bronx and Queensbridge just couldn't stop beefin'
Kept it on wax they ain't have to pack heat
Back to Ron G tapes, back to Black Sheep

""I'm number one—one—one—one""
Damn it feels good to see hip-hop say it's #1

Come on say it with me
I'm talking old Bobby Brown before he thugged Whitney
I used bring all my toys in the tub with me
A snotty-nosed kid eating boogers
It was Ultimate Warrior and Jimmy Fly Snuka, uh
Sometimes I read scriptures like Psalms maybe
And I didn't wanna go to church but my moms made me
TV made me laugh
I remember Knight Rider, Kit used to save his ass
Let's go back to spooning back to Black Moon and
Back to when wrestling had its own cartoon and
They used to sleep on us, now they demand us
Will Smith told parents they just ain't understand us
Back to playing the dozens
Back to humping our prettiest girl cousin
Psych! I'm buggin
N.W.A. was simply known
Let's get back on the block I'm talking Quincy Jones
I gotta Jones y'all

""I'm number one—one—one—one""
Damn it feels good to see hip-hop say it's #1

Let's go back before I burned the booth
When Tevin Campbell was ill before the whole world learned the truth
Hip hop had a message then, jewels was dropping
I never got what I wanted on back to school shopping
Think about it, used to be about shit
That was back when I still got Easter outfits
We all grew up all older folks
It's more than just the music, it's a culture, folks

""I'm number one—one—one—one""
Damn it feels good to see hip-hop say it's #1

Remember sugar water
What was the name of the fucking drink
That they said the fucking triple K
The Klu Klux Klan and shit had put some shit in and

Whipping bitches niggas black, ass like a cotton picker
Bomb through debris - 
I'm holdin two pistols
In the form of a cross yeah I am armed to the T
I put on for my city, I take off for whoever
Think I'm soft for my job of rappin, go back to clappin
Back to illin, back to dealin, back to coc-a-ina
Up the nose, that's the feelin, sky the limit, that's the ceilin
And the women is the whores, puttin numbers up for sales
It's the score into hell, it's the feel, it's the feel

Cordially they forcin me to act accordingly
When according to me my thoughts disorderly just like they outta be
It's more to me in accord to me
Just mad at the smoke and the mirrors, image, perceptions and the forgery
Everything is a fraud to me
So until the boys wake up, me and my boys make up
Be with the toy sprayers, aimin noise makers at the noise makers {*blam*}
Best group ever, group of whoever who do it better
Bets placed on it (nigga!) number one got our face on it
And I make a case on it, treason
Every twelve months it's huntin season
They call us Slaughterhouse for a reason!

 Crooked!

Piano face Audemars, you haters know the time
Drug abusin fourth-grader, I mean a loaded nine
Hits in the stash, Ferrari Spider, the road is mine
Like lap dancers and bad brakes, I'm on the grind
So tell Officer Crawford that this is (Slaughterhouse)
And I left the next black president in his daughter's mouth
Swallow my kids then I'm like, ""Yo I gotta bounce""
Ben Franklin's a math genius and every dollar counts
We takin over the game, go at you little wussies
(Why?) Cause that's the sweetest joy next to gettin pussy
Somethin bad is emergin
Slaughter's blowin up like a suicide bomber promised 70 virgins nigga

 Ortiz!

One quarter of Slaughter reportin to you live
From a corner where reporters stop by
Since somebody playin pow-pow
Shots fly out a Glock-9 'til you cooked like a potpie
Take a look at everybody in my crew
Bet you can't find a member of the squad that is not fly
Anybody say they can see us they either lyin
Or not wearin they glasses, apparently cock-eyed
We don't shit, we ca-ca
We don't spit, we emit lava
Got a grip on these hip-hoppers like a big lobster
Everybody know the deal when the hear the kid YOWWA!
Goo-goo, ga-ga, baby cryin 'bout the internet
They get on the site but they showed me and Joe the other night
Takin flights then lightin up a cigarette
Motherfucker we ill, not one insect step short of the best thing
Everything we touch make they head swing and, y'all ain't really interestin
Throw a shot, and our fans do the interceptin

That's what I'm trynna do
And I know I don't even gotta tell you, ""You fine"" but you...
But you got me fucked up
Look I wanna get next you
But I won't keep textin' you
And you think every nigga only wanna have sex with you
Baby, don't be stuck up

I done been around bad bitches my whole life
And I don't mean to be rude
But if I had to make a top ten list it wouldn't include you
I been around bad bitches my whole life
And reality of it is
I know you fuckin' with a nigga
And the bottom line you cute too
So while I get to know you
And you get to know me
Whatever gonna happen it'll happen slowly
There's enough pussy in this world for me to not need yours
So even if I hold you
Let you hold me
Even if we spend time together for the whole week
There's enough pussy in this world for me to not need yours

Now tell me what I'm supposed to do
Should I be like every nigga that you meet up in the streets?
And a beast nigga close to you
I'd much rather get the most of you
Instead of getting my dick sucked
We could hit the strip club and pour it up
Make a toast to you
So let me tell you I got through 'em
And I love already
You the person I be thinking of already
So if we took it further
That would lead to murder
She would find you
And you'd probably get snuffed already
Cause she gon' ask ""Who that bitch?""
So when I say ""She just a friend,""
I really wanna mean ""She just a friend.""

I always seem to take one step backward and five steps forward
Nothin to gain, it's like everything's mortgaged
Y'all can love me or y'all won't, go 'head and talk shit
Cautious, report shit (I mean) live out of hell
Since all my dudes either alive or out of jail (ohh!)
Won't fold, won't curl - no wonder all this weight's on my shoulders
I'm sittin on the bottom of the world!
They say, tears are words that your mouth can't speak (ohh!)
Rubber on every arm could fire but can't reach
I say, streets learn you what the schools can't teach
My job's to get a gospel that the church won't preach
Somethin like a rock star, keep the live band
Just sub my True Religions for those skin-tight pants (yeah!)
Ass on my wife, no nice implants
I mean no accessories, the crime's been an accessory
It's a thinkin man's world, shit is chess to me
So let the king move, meantime let it be
My blood is on FIRE in this muh'fucker!
Pack your bags, packin up for the weekend

You could feel the fire rush right through the veins
Look on the horizon
You could see the sun, but the night still controls the pain-yay-yay-yain

Yo... it's the Junk Yard Gang, Drew Hudson reppin Jersey
Reverse the psyche on life and do the mic dirty
Tired, hungry and thirsty, motherfuck fame
Matter fact, when this verse ends forget my name
It's the message not the man, the vision not the plan
No glitz or glam, just pure connection with the fans
Half your downloads get deleted with the spam
These dudes keep it so real, they come across fake
Straight boring, ignore these wack bastards
Approach us too forward, these frauds is ass backwards
I just vividly spit it to pick it differently
Rip all the vodka, swig it then pissin on negativity
The pen's mightier than the trigger, strike 'em when I spit
Real catchy, huh? I don't even like that shit
What I like, a rock flow that's lava
Melodic, with a high dose of more fire
The fire and the rain, the fire in my veins is hot
Can't be stopped with fire brigades
UHH! No image, I'm livin every synonym twisted
In this syllable spliff six of them hits'll leave you lifted
All heart and gut, feelin the hunts
Adrenaline rush, c'mon! Shit's heatin up


Uh-huh, l-look look; I wear a K as a weapon
Eye through scope case my foes at the top of my stairway to heaven
And I, pop a big step, dressed in my fly shit
IPod, headphones on bumpin my shit
I never cared, I was careless
Fear bein afraid (or) or maybe I'm afraid to be fearless
(Or) Or fear bein fearless but fearful
So even in my carelessness, gotta be careful
I'm like, who's that lookin threw my peephole?
When did my alter-ego get a ego?
He wants the rims chrome
Me I'm tryin to push the pedal 'til my FOOT'S on the ground like a Flintstone
Bluetooth, my girl on the horn bickerin
But even though when she SCREAM I hear it like whisperin
I been around noise all my life
I've been poised baby all my life, just let me live my life!
Live yours, make your own highlight
Then meet me at the top like a butterfly knife
Then you'll, learn how to see without eyesight
If, at first you don't succeed then try twice
See I don't write it I will it, reel it, real shit
Paint a masterpeice then unveil it, come I'm 'bout to reveal it!
Destroy it, rebuild it
Then conceal it before another nigga steals it (I mean)
Milk shit, not a pessimist, I'm a realist
When you think you on, I go and hit the killswitch
Drummer rockin, he's ill bitch
If they sleep don't wake 'em, just drill shit

Waited all this time
Stood my place in line and now
It’s here, I’m finally on
Clock was moving slow
Had some room to grow
Life is short, it’s time
I let these motherfuckers know

What up everyone that been there
Some of y'all know I never left, I been here
Text baby girl I’ll be back
Got some unfinished business to tend to
Gotta go sell out these venues
Y'all niggas just food on the menu
Doubt y'all know what I been through
But it’s funny watching all of y'all pretend to

Finally got me alone
Waited all this time
Stood my place in line and now

Flew a model broad in so you know I'm knee deep at the Hyatt
But careful see she be a riot
And she known to stab niggas like Keke Wyatt
Fuck rap, look what they leave me to ride wit
Joints that sound like feces compared to my shit
Pen game down they can't survive wit
Geico bars, a caveman could write it
Suprised they don't tote them things man
I got some AK's longer than Greg Oden's wingspan
Some of these slugs is for wanna be thugs
They soft, bitch made call em Summer's Eve Thugs
Son I'm that nigga, guns blast quicker
When dopeboyz is short I front em the cash nigga
I talk about birds cause my hun ass bigger
You in the pursuit of happiness, bum ass nigga
Got beef wit locals ain't been too vocal
To me it's jus a waste of protools
Me versus them is like Dolph Lundgren wit his hand crammed on Apollo
They get the sandman at the Apollo
Welcome to doomsday I'm Kobe in the clutch
Tiger wit the club, Van Damme at the kumite
Roll wit invisible men, but ya'll know
Keep them E-40's on him, I jus tell em when 2 go
I ain't the best that done it, jus a wreckless young kid
Wit Big L's wit & some Lord Finesse punches
My deep joints like a mirage of Pac's shit
Eminem insanity, wit Nas' knowledge
But nah, he ain't emo he more like a rap hero
Trapped like Nicholas Cage at Ground Zero
They don't like Jerz they wanna see J done
And they only lovin' New York on VH1
I can't front I'm terrified an era died
And if I made an error and its alive
Then it should probably be sterilized
I'm hella live, jus not on ya screen
They told me the Revolution will not be televised
And the fans sayin Joe you the truth
Mixtapes the glass ceiling and I broke through the roof
I'm more of a hood star
I never been this nigga to put out 20 tapes
Wit jus 4 good bars
You feelin loco lil deranged in the head
Be lookin like Ghost Rider when them flames to ya head
The hood sayin Joe don't pop in
They jus wanna street fight I'd rather stretch money like Dhalsim
Chillin on the Caman's, shot to the ceiling from the pavement
Whats wit all the grilling and the hatin'
When you get your 1st piece of jewelry
You'll probably understand why I'm walkin round feeling like Peyton
Got my seat back in that suburban reppin'
Since the album's becoming like an urban legend
But indeed its gon' help, I'm the only thing that keep gettin better
The longer you leave it on the shelf, uh huh, slight fever
Some different type heaters that's designed to hit every body part like Lever
And ya mans ain't gon have no time to warn you
Aside from that hoodie it ain't no 9's on you
And crime here's normal, wit rimmed up cars
Rugers & gem stars jus study the memoirs
You want it wit a con come see me
Shotguns'll be comin out the closet like John Amechi
They thought he wouldn't make that baretta go off
Cause his shoes Gucci, & his leather so soft
I know what you rookies about like Britney Spears
When I see you guaranteed pussy is out, ya heard?
You can't look for me locally, try Vegas
You need a plane ticket though you can't ride Avis
Hi Haters!, I'm sorry for the hiatus
You know I stay up in pussy like vibrators
Ya money that short homeslice why wage it
Don't bet check the bookie I'm a high favorite
Them beams out have that light set dead for him
& fuck hoes I'm too Right Said Fred for em
The goons by me I hand em the fo' fifth
You runnin like they ain't got the stamina to go wit
Them hammers unload quick, my new shit is
Home invasion find your wifey like Anna Nicole Smith
Nigga don't move less the cal is on you wait
Oh you mad cuz I'm stylin' on you
Play wolf til them real ones howlin' on you

Realestate,Mood Muzik 4.5: The Worst Is Yet To Come,2011,"Yea... Joey...
It's that on top muzik!
Yea, wait a minute!

Yo, I left the jumpsuit on a park bench
Slept there, smellin like the park stench
Freezin, covered with a dark trench
That room, more like the Kryptonite to my Clark Kent
Tired of all the IQ tests, and all the arguments
Nurses light the candles with the calm scents
I ain't been calm since, they actin like I ain't got any common sense
Too much time spent for a godsend
So I left on my own recognizance, handful of Klonopins
Lookin for a car jack vict', preferably dark tints
Seems you got to eat to get even and my odds slim
They say I'm a animal, cannibal, hannibal
Lookin at my past I see how that's understandable
So you god damn right I'm unmanageable
Everything I'm lookin at is a fuckin intangible
Got me thinking that I'm really a skits
Maybe that room didn't really exist, cause I left, but...

These walls still closing, and the room starts spinnin'
And the ceiling starts falling and the devil starts grinnin'
The floor starts droppin and my eyes get heavy
Then ears start bleeding from the lies niggas fed me
Then the door slams shut and my legs try to run
But my feet won't move then my body gets numb
And I ain't on pills, I can't explain how I feel
Will somebody tell me this ain't real?!
Realestate

My reality is reality
They reality is all perception
In my reality that's an infection
My reality don't want no part of that detection
So I pick it up and move it to another section
They reality you would think is full of perfection
Correction, they reality is all deception
In reality only few will make that connection
But if you like me you know not to take that direction
If reality is dead, I'm the resurrection
Nominate myself so let's skip over the election
They'll say I'm the wrong selection
Don't meet they expectance
But I ain't lookin' for motherfuckin' acceptance
Fuck y'all expect shit, the mud on ya white glove
Reality is full of rules, I'm full of objections
They reality is a big misconception
So I left just to lose my recollection! But still...
Realestate


Yo, they say money makes the world go 'round
But it really doesn't
Did I think I was in a room, when I really wasn't?
I thought I was on the move, wasn't really budging
But you ain't never wore my shoes, who you really judging
Some people are so judgmental, I'll allow that
You can judge anything but my mental
He don't know what I been through
From results of the pencil
Cuts from being resentful
Don't cover much of the stencil
When I couldn't walk, they ain't have a crutch to lend dude
So I say what I feel, fuck if I offend you!
Some fail, maybe some of succeeded
Some need to be wanted, some wanna be needed
I scream and yell; They don't hear my call
And it seems much as I fell, don't know where I fall
Not at all, I'm just actin out fate
But ain't much change since I escaped... All I know is!",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-realestate-lyrics
No Comment,Escape Route,2009,"Uh-ohhhh, uh-oh
Uh-ohhhhhh! That on top, ohh!
Ta-ha, Joey (yeah, shit go hard too)
No comment, no comment
Ta-ha, whole bunch of yappin
Jersey! That N.J. bullshit
Let me talk to 'em, l-look look look

Since the world don't revolve around me
(Then what?) Hoodie on, revolver on me
I'm the wrong one you wanna amp (why?)
Cause niggas could get missing
Like you straight out of LeBron's summer camp (ohh!)
Anytime the fed's see me
I tell 'em that the only thing FUCKERY here gets you an STD
My life, should be sold as a movie
From the *Slum dog* tryin to be a +Millionaire+, no groupies
When did the civilians decide to be a thug?
Motivated by the hate (BUT) inspired by the love
Rappers sayin my name like it's a bright tactic
*Jackson 5*, put your *Mike* in a casket
Let the fans gas you and tell you you're nice
Be a legend in RAP, but a failure in life
For real, I don't think these dudes is spectacular
Pretty Ricky thugs who move like spectacular, nigga!

What up with you and so-and-so? Heard you got a diss
Don't know about THAT, but I know about this nigga
No comment (what) no comment (what)
No comment, I ain't got a comment
Bloggers, Twitter, Budden TV
No comment, y'all ain't gettin nothin from me
I said, no comment (what) no comment
No comment, I ain't got a comment

So I been called a snitch (BUT)
But I been called worse by better so let's skip over the lecture
That's a common lie (why?)
Cause if I ever call the cops it's only gon' be to report a homicide
How am I in beef? I walk about free
They only talk about YOU, when you talk about ME
So go ahead and act hard
And somebody gon' grab chalk (and) and turn the streets into a blackboard
So I'm supposed to put niggas on a pedestal
For rappin 'bout a bunch of bullshit that they don't ever do
You look stupid when you go there
Say I'm only hot online you ain't heatin up nowhere
SHOT-gun in SHOT-gun, ride right past ya
Windows down, got every right to blast ya
No wonder he thinkin he'll provide a disaster
Cause bitches keep tellin him that size don't matter (ta-ha)
 w/ ad libs

Things niggas say I don't mind it
Say they lost respect for me, who the FRUCK is askin you to find it?
This is me practicing censorship
Since the new definition of real nigga is sensitive
In his interview, say I'm askin for a hearse
But couple months BACK he was askin for a verse
Only hurts is the team used to bump you
Now he look like a fiend, I should slump you",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-no-comment-lyrics
Now I Lay,Padded Room,2009.0,"""Pump it up, you came to get it crunk
A dame and shit and drunk, you came to get it on""
That's when it all got started, I mean
Back then I wasn't so cold-hearted
With every stanza came an extravaganza
For every question he got one less answer
I was tryin' to be more than cool
Nah, it was before that, maybe boarding school
That was back when I would want to endanger myself
Maybe it was just to entertain myself
I don't need help, I could change myself
Fuck ya'll, I ain't gotta explain myself
Death's around the corner, I could hear his footsteps
Does he think that I'm the only nigga in the hood left
So tell any listener of mine, for twenty-eight years been a prisoner of the mind

Now I lay me down to sleep, and I
I pray the Lord my soul to keep, if I
If I should die before I wake, then I
I pray the Lord my soul to take, I mean

Welcome everybody into the brain of a self-proclaimed sinner
Even when he can't win, that nigga won't surrender
Boones Farm put the wheels in motion
I felt every emotion except devotion
Message in a bottle in the bottom of the ocean
But I can't swim, dammit I can't win
So I don't care how you rate me
It'd take a long time to evaluate me
So if, this be the last time you hear me
Just know I got a loved one near me
Please don't cry, let an eye get teary
A nigga good, finally I'm somewhere care free
Past is frightening but the future's scary
And I'm, gettin' to the point that I fear me
In a class all alone, don't compare me
But I'll, blame God this is where he steered me


They tell me that eyes is the window to a man's soul
So what you happen to see a nigga can't control
And I turned a def ear
To anything an anybody that'll get my head clear
Why shake the dice if you never gon roll em
I told em, that the straitjacket can't hold em
I ain't psycho, don't belittle me now
It's just a title cause they couldn't figure me out
If you give a damn when shit hits the fan
Please know anything I ever did a nigga planned
Tryin' to better, high as ever
Since I learned how to lie to a lie detector, still I'm damaged
They say if you stay in that boat long enough you'll see where the land is
So I'm right where I need to be
Please believe it believe it please, let's get on our knees",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-now-i-lay-lyrics
Role Play (Interlude),No Love Lost,2013.0,"(Joe Budden)
Shit, goddamn is it tight
Shit baby, turn up turn up
Take that take that, look at look what you got
You got me doing Puff Daddy in this pussy

Slow down with this pussy

If I Gotta Go,Padded Room,2009.0,"If I gotta go (yeah, woo!)
Can anybody tell me where? (ohh!)
And if I gotta go (if I gotta go)
Does anybody even care? (ohh!)

L-look, look
We gon' party like it's 1-9-9-9
Somethin triggers makin my mind design crime when at times my mind's fine
Inclinded to find dimes, resigned from primetime
I need my stars to align when signs say they benign
Tell whoever cares if a stray happens to hit me
I need to take all the money I made with me
If I'm heaven-bound I'll put a hole in every turncoat
If hellbound I'm poppin shit through the inferno
My jargon is, I'm a arsonist
Since 11 when I found out what arson is
Look at me fully styled in that foreign whip
I get a high from it, I love that Johnny Carson shit
I got a fascination for the aggravation
True to my untruths, I love the fabrication
Waitin on a antedote, but I lack the patience
On a second thought, I got my own vaccination


All I ever dream's alone
That makes me wanna run and charge
Ohhhhhh...
All I ever dream's alone
That makes me wanna run and charge
Ohhhhhh...

Underdig this
Problem is I'm smarter than e'rybody
But too numb to show it; they too dumb to know it (nigga!)
Eventually my A's turned into D's
Eventually my O's made its way to E
I'm tense, I'm not at ease, there's niggas with degrees
That ain't never made it hot nor turned up the degrees
There's niggas with credentials, accolades, paperwork (but)
But couldn't figure out how to make they paper work
Me, I fight to stay alive, e'ry day is work
Especially when they say it's six million ways to murk (here's one)
I wish the whole world was more like me
More likely to see through the eyes that I see
Or be tired like I be, let's hide our ID's
There's holes in my arms, untied this IV
At times, wish the world would comprehend like I do
Know it sound like I don't wanna mend, but I'd like to


Forewarnin nigga, ya heard?
L-look look look look; I wonder what's behind the clouds
Flew all over the world, still I couldn't find out
Maybe I'm normal and e'rybody else isn't
Apron on over the stove in hell's kitchen
Uh, nails bitten, uh, failed livin
Another derailed mission for a nigga jail smitten
Enough to get the pound - if I don't like the shit around me
Maybe I should change the shit that I'm around
How that sound? Uhh",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-if-i-gotta-go-lyrics
Hardball,UnKnown,2018.0,"(New Joe, new Joe, new, new, new, new Joe Budden.)
Hey!
Hey! Mic check 1, 2, 1, 2. Turn the beat up somethin Parks

Look...
I'm seeing a couple things wrong with the way that I'm living
So come and Walk With Me, I just need a second opinion
Let me take you there, the crib, gotta see if you notice
There's plenty room in this mansion, but ain't enough room for Joseph
Now every thought is corroded, choices I blow it like I'm more than explosive
More than heroic, begged the Lord for some focus
Broke every law that was voted, told them to walk with a poet
I was so poor when I wrote it, you can't ignore the heroics (?)
I'm talking Star Wars, Star Wars, I'm talking Star Wars
The demons that come with the clothes, jewellery and car doors
Most be in a fight with themselves. Don't know they are at war
If you gone go to war for the art - study the Art of War
Think it was Carter 4 when y'all disregarded it all
I assumed if you bought the bars you was willing to (more than fall?)
I mean as far as I recall I'd of saw the coroner
While I'm thanking all of my niggas like this was our war
It's all about money but wasn't suited for change
Did these hoes really love me or did they use me for fame?
They made me out like a villain, I been a beautiful Bane
Painkillers no longer working, guess I'm just used to the pain
But now look at the way that we up, faces hard to keep up
Models with fake D cups thirsty waiting to see us
Calm, waiting to re-up, was calm breaking the weed up
Around the time Camron's mom was dating D Rugz
Was grabbed by Lincoln, we was high and was leaning
Looking like lying and scheming and wave riding for streaming
I'm waving hi to my demons, by my side like I need 'em
Shit, I rely on em even if such illogical thinking. It's my most
Innocent, intimate thoughts.  More than insensitive
Might offend and appall but there's no venom, enthralled
Ill-tempered, they said you might just get a sense that I'm off
Never meant for my temperament to be so different from y'all
Too many minions with opinions that's false
Rated me Shady way before Eminem called, just wasn't mentioning Pause (Paul?)
Too many symptoms to sort, throw in the ??? withdrawl
My average sentiments begins with what resentments has caused
I'm talking Star Wars, Star Wars, I'm talking Star Wars
The shit that come with the clothes, jewellery and car doors
Remember when we started from breakdancing on cardboard?
Now we pray to our Lord they don't give us what's ours Lord???
Star Wars, Star Wars, it's only Star Wars
With bats to the label when niggas was playing hard ball
Lucky if you make it, trust me if you know what y'all doin
They feed us crumbs when really we deserve far more
I'm hardball, GS and check
Success to me is when you look back on your past and you don't see a regret
If I didn't tell you I dropped out it'd be the least disrespect
Moved to work in Montclear but it's St Peter's I rep
Since we the only profession contingent on your discretion
But when you censor it's members then it's no longer expression
Long ago I was longing to get it on with depression
Another form of oppression, deadly and (four minute seconds / form in a second?????)
I wonder why we as artists just look to seek this profession
Develop hard skin for jargon while taking heat for suggestions
I think our deepest confessions lie underneath this aggression
The shit they never schooled me on it always teach me the lesson
Niggas injectin all these weekly projections, eager for media press to leave a request and then repeatedly press him
Only to see his transgressions, and y'all believe this deception / perception ???
And would agree it's upsettin, all of this greed and obsession
I often wonder why it's celebrated. Beside the fact that
It meant it probably mean you went to Hell if you made it
Selfish frustrated, they ain't help you create it, or are they jealous and hated
Do you need help with self hatred, or for the wealth that you traded?
It's hard ball and hard balls give me three outs now
Let it ring/rain ???, to be Ralph then it gotta be Ralph now...
Whose to blame, well if it's me well then I had method to my madness
Started even before me and Method had that madness
People saying I patronise...
Such a creative lie, we all outta control but appear stabilised
The way they self-medicate, shit. Hopin they survive
Watch how they killing themselves only to stay alive
Give me flashbacks, I was mobbin just gettin by
Now watch it solidify, throwing dollars up in the sky
You get bothersome, if problems get poppin we let em fly
My tolerance just ain't high if the tolerance ain't a high
My nigga hear tho, this is the part, like they don't hear Joe
Weirdoes in weird clothes, all of these weird flows
Weird though, where shares go, I came in bare though
Therefore shit like a jungle, might need a beard so

Happy Holiday,Padded Room,2009.0,"Chorus (Emanny)
Everydays the same to me
Seven days in every week
Some look forward to it
But I don't change just for the holiday's
You can have your Christmas tree (Hello)
Go get drunk on New Years eve
Some look forward to it (Can anybody hear me)
But I don't change cause every day's a holiday
Hey, Cause every days a holiday
Hey, Cause every days a holiday

Mic check 1212
Mic check 1212
If ain't tell me tomorrow was my birthday I would never know
Understand I'm kinda bad with dates
I don't need a party but a nigga need cake
I got to much on my plate to celebrate
Whole family unemployed
So incomes now a void
Footing everybody's bill
So naturally I'm annoyed
It's like the year kinda flew by
And like a fool I sat back and scrutinized
I'm high beaming on a dark road
All my goals now ashes on charcoal
I spark stogs
Disregard car's
Just cause my hearts cold
I'm carrying cargo
No offense
Don't need a phone call or a presents
I mean honestly I don't want none of ya'll present
Cause I won't pretend like my everyday struggles went away
So I'mma treat this like any normal day. Come On

Everydays the same to me
Seven days in every week
Some look forward to it
But I don't change just for the holiday's
You can have your Christmas tree (Hello)
Go get drunk on New Years eve
Some look forward to it (Can anybody hear me)
But I don't change cause every day's a holiday

If they ain't tell me tomorrow was Halloween I'd never known
I've never been the type to keep up with dates so while ah
Everybody is putting there mask on
Nigga I rock mine all year
Just to avoid stares
To come across like a nigga who cares
So to my peers I can look like I'm really sincere
Yeah
Everything's not what it appear
I fear being rare my costume aware
I swear I won't take it off like nair
It's weird
Even when I take it off shits near
To some my outfit is sheer
So I despise their jeers cause they know I see them all as mirror
Don't love ya'll enough to let you see me bare
Let you see how he's impaired
Naw I'm not there
We tend to run from anything weird
At least on Halloween ya'll would stay right there
Yeah

Everydays the same to me
Seven days in every week
Some look forward to it
But I don't change just for the holiday's
You can have your Christmas tree
Go get drunk on New Years eve
Some look forward to it
But I don't change cause every day's a holiday

If I didn't read it was Christmas I'd never known
Maybe I'm wrong I don't give a fuck about dates
So while everybody's unwrapping gifts
I'm trying to capitalize off mine
Just to get some shine
Outta recline while I'm still in my prime
To many time when the date came I ain't have a dime
So I look at my friends with envy
For some reason them getting gifts would offend me
Like there home was perfect
Mine felt empty
They say that it's the thought that counts
I had plenty
Like why
On thanksgiving my family would never visit
And even when they did it always seemed so scripted
Like they was forced to
Like small talk would resolve the 364 days they ain't call you
I should act like ya'll somebody I'm close to
Holidays don't make me socials
I hate to be vocal

Everydays the same to me
Seven days in every week
Some look forward to it
But I don't change just for the holiday's
You can have your Christmas tree
Go get drunk on New Years eve
Some look forward to it
But I don't change cause every day's a holiday",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-happy-holiday-lyrics
40 Licks,Mood Muzik 2: Can It Get Any Worse?,2005,"Look I can give a fuck about opinions, like 'em or love 'em
I never change up, if you don't like 'em then fuck 'em
'Cause I was brought up sayin' sticks and stones
Only let you know about whoever's doin' the throwin'
Dudes is far from what they pretend to be though
I done fired a few shots and got plenty to go
So nah, if it ain't love, let's begin to be foes
'Cause now my mind kind of off, I'm like Emily Rose
When I seen my first man get murdered
I took a little strike from the game like a transit worker
I can't, won't keep pushin' packs to get paid
And be a grown ass man with no accolades
And know the truth hurts I can't fabricate
So nothing's made up, just the facts I say
My son 'bout to have a brother
It's a different father, same mother, if it ain't one thing it's another
Sometimes this rap shit seems so easy
'Til you home lookin' at that TV
Pissed you havin' a fit, changin' it from MTV
'Cause you starin' at them, thinkin' that should BE ME
The game and myself is like Jessica and Nick, 'bout to leave
The folks thought we'd never ever split
Try to work through it all that we done for each other
Both talented but one is too dumb for the other
Let it go to its boiling point
Til it felt like a long episode of Boiling Points
But all I gots this mic and this booth while I'm in it
I figure might as well tell the truth while I'm in it
Latifa said enjoy my youth while I'm in it
I told her I do but the proof's still tinted
I'm like an old man with no friends or family
Tryin' to cleanse what he got left of his sanity
It's no happy dude here
I'm mad at the world while I'm wishing y'all Happy New Year
It's only fair somebody had one
New Year's for me always be like my last one
New year, same girl, she the same soldier
Think it's all good, probably 'cause I told her
But I got some resentment, shit that I ain't over
I don't trust baby girl far as I can throw her
Rightfully or wrongly she's gettin' quick sized
I'm on the horn askin' chicks for their tit-size
Face smilin' and there's tears in the kid's eyes
Hidin' it from hoes, by talkin' about my dick size
In the hood with the best of 'em
I'm still hood, just not hood like the rest of 'em
Where's the answer
Don't ask for a cig', I'm so self-centered I won't even share this cancer
Look to the sky
Talk to an invisible man and hope one day my prayers get answered
This shit gets hard with every pull from this cig' or cigar
More like what every lick from the guitar, GOD!",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-40-licks-lyrics
If All Else Fails,Mood Muzik 4: A Turn 4 The Worst,2010,"Mic check, one two, one two
This what the fuck I'm talkin about right here though
You ready Parks?

Check it (woo!), if all else fails, I get back to what I know
Ratchet for my foes (uh), watchin for informants, take a stab at it with snow
Long john jacket for the cold, some habits are hard to outgrow
I work so hard, you think the studio's my lodge inn
If all else fails (what?)
I don't have a doubt that I'd be back in that studio apartment
Gettin it in, closet size living room and the kitchen's my den
Playin lotto, hopin numbers'll save the day
Back to price checking, back to layaways
Since I ain't never hit nothin like a bad fadeaway
Back to the corner, takin a bag of haze to face
Basic flow, when I tried to get my cake to grow (what?)
I hit the pawn shop and turn into Trader Joe
Sheisty kid, yack ya jewels while they glistenin
Snatch the hearing aid from a senior, while they listenin
If all else fail, don't know where I'd be
Scratch that, probably at home, nowhere to be
Or probably fuckin a broad that, I treat like a floor mat
Ugly enough to cover her face when a gauze pad (uh)
And that's a step down from my New York rat
That ride it like a horse back (uh), with the horse back
But it won't fail, so if you try to rob the kid
Banana clips by the bed'll put a stop to it
Nevermind that, first you gotta beat the guard
I can change the channel on my TV and see the yard
If it all failed, I'm ready for the scam
Forgin fake checks screamin �Catch Me If You Can�
If all else fails, I'd be out pullin Jerz capers
Knowin me, I'd be best friends with my worst haters
Uh, I'd be dustin off the AR or be behind state bars, for jackin a bait car
If all failed, I'd be right back in them block cyphers
Just to show these local niggas I'm a lot nicer
Cause the less you succeed, the more you loved for it
While the more you achieve, the more you snubbed for it
If all else failed and my pockets were empty
Everything I despised, I'd probably envy
Ignorant shit rappers floss that offends me
Cause I wouldn't be able to attain it, it would tempt me
Frontin in my man's Maserati
I might bag somethin with a modest body, from a college party
Next morning hungover so she can't remember
I would deck my whole crib out from Rent-A-Center
If all else failed and I ain't get a break yet
I'd get unemployment while collectin a paycheck
Would it mean I wasn't built for the bright lights?
Say goodbye to front row seats at fight night
If it all failed, I'd have a pretty common future
From a Chart House nigga to a Ramen noodler
Would my girl say you no longer attract me
Pack up all her shit and head South with an athlete?
My name would hold no weight, so I'd lose the perks
OD on OxyContin, abuse the percs
I'd be a felon gettin my scriptures tatted on (uh)
First 48 star gettin ratted on
If all else fails, I wouldn't take precaution
New hooptie every month would be my way of flossin
And the crib would be an all night party
With six baby moms, then I'd Jet 'em like Cromartie
Uh, fantasizin the girls I could of dated
Hood referrin to 'em as the one that could of made it
Uh, I'd be the only one who cares
Or am I just recitin my fears as they appear?
Shouldn't of even put the idea in the air

Time Flies,Mood Muzik 4.5: The Worst Is Yet To Come,2011,"Look how life, life has changed
Movin up, to bigger things
Look how time flies by... 
(Ain't it funny how time goes by... )
I see the storm, thru the rain
As for you, your still the same
Look how time flies by... 
(Ain't it funny how time goes by... )

Check out your man who came up around the dope boys and backstabbers
A dropout whom some referred to as a backpacker
Dude they used to laugh at, 'member him?
Bad rapper, exactly why being on the cover of that mag matters
I chop it up with some artists I used to beef with
Glad we all grew to see how played out beef is
Besides, that ain't something we're all willing to afford
When your talented you try to get a million out of more
Made a killing on tour, so while I'm wheelin that Azure
I'm wishing all my black youths could know the feeling I endure
For some folks, my ceiling is their floor
Wondering where I'd be if I ain't feel like persevering anymore
Look what time does, need a reality check
It'll remind us, you can't run from it, it'll always find us
And that's the game I respect it
Rockin a different watch, but it gives the same message


Look, I used to see her on the TV
Now she textin' how she miss me and she need me
It's funny I remember when she couldn't take it
Now when she get naked
Shorty ride it to the point I'm thinkin she about to break it
It's a few broads that ain't agree with my style
Throwin' it at me, yeah they Cliff Lee with it now
I mean they ain't wanna smile at me, wouldn't say what up
So I have them face down but turnin their faces up
Same broads you grew up with... with no body
Is gettin work done... tired of being nobody
Fake tits and ass, changing their look vastly
Like niggas don't remember how they looked last week
I'll diss a broad in a second, don't put it past me
You don't want the truth? Bitch probably shouldn't of asked me!
Cause they be thinkin they really be on the mind
Though they rockin a nice watch, clearly got the wrong time


Look at ya man washed up
Lookin like he needs to wash up
Fell off now he just watch us
Was playin ball, something happened to the weight
Tried the dope boy shit, but I guess the same applied
Had a short fall from grace, how the fucks you a critic?!
Damn near 35, how the fucks you in a civic?!
Rimmed up, tryna stunt, lookin ridiculous
And he be dead sober, with them drunk lookin bitches
Frail ass nigga, life movin' slow, snail ass nigga
In the club before 12 ass nigga
And the nigga used to knock me, now his shit is just sloppy
Catch him in some jeans shorts, Issey Miyake
Smoked out son, you ain't get the memo?
Still believing your own hype, still making demo's
No grind, which lead to a short prime
But homie ain't got a watch, how he gon' know the time?

Things You Do,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Things you do, to make me wanna' leave you
To make me wanna' go somewhere and do things I ain't supposed to do
You got me going crazy, thinking I just gotta' get away
Baby girl, you're not that far away from a nigga leaving you
Yea

Alright breathe, let's talk for a minute, ain't gotta be naive
As much as we argue, for real he might leave
In your mind, you say your dude slacken'
But how we go from being soul mates to you packing
Or me leaving, me creeping, us beefin'
Going weeks without speakin' for no reason
How you gonna' ignore me or get a little jealous
Anytime a girl call me, making up your own stories
I been with you for years, supposed to die together
If I risk you for one night, I would hide it better
Now here's something you should think 'bout
You snatching numbers out my phone just to call bitches I don't even think 'bout
And the madness all started with a cute crush
You moving in, it all started with a tooth brush
Told you I'd walk out your life and never look back
You mistook that, so fuck it let's bring the hook back


Oh girl you know I'm tired of coming home to you
(Crying, fussing)
I can't even come home without you saying I'm
(Lying, bunting)
I'm better than this
Girl you know I'm sick of you
(Tripping, cussing)
You keep playing these games and girl you know I'll hit the door
(Quickly, sudden)
Oh, It's the things you do girl

Look, why scream and why yell
I'm so sure I'm where I wanna' be like Donnell
But that don't mean I can't go out with a friend, calamari and some cocktails
You puttin' curfews on a nigga but it's not jail
Spaz anytime the AOL say you got mail
Hit the club, you think I'm out being Akinyele
With nothing tempting me, sleeping with the enemy
Argue by yourself baby, I ain't got the energy


You wanna' fight about the dishes, the dog
Your workplace, the cable, my friends
Your parents, Myspace, is he faithful
There's two things cheating will do
Tell me we ain't meant to be or make me just appreciate you
Listen I'ma be fine, just need some me time
Not us or we time, since we can't rewind
You fightin' throwin' shit at me
I ain't scrapin' with you, fuck around
Lose the best thing that ever happened to you

Girl you know I can be
I can be what you want and need
Girl you know I can try
To give you everything you need from me
Girl all I need is a chance
To prove to you I can be your man
You should've let me
But I'm 'bout to leave",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-things-you-do-lyrics
Roll Call,Mood Muzik Vol. 3.5 ,2007.0,"Sometimes a nigga need theme music (uh huh)
Sometimes you gotta set a mood
Let's dim these lights in this motherfucking booth
Dim the lights out there too
I don't need to see you niggas too much (Jump Off ...)
Can't be Mood Muzik without a mood
But look (it's), look, it's what? (it's that On Top Music)

The name of this shit right here is called Roll Call

Niggas on my left (yeah), niggas on my right (yeah)
Does anybody wanna hear some real shit tonight (yeah)
Real as it'll get (yeah), holster on my hip (yeah)
Is anybody tired of that bubble gum shit (yeah)

They say hip hop is dead or on life support
Maybe not, that could be something I just thought
I just ought to jump in, fighting the sport
How you expect to be heard, when your mic is off
I would love to go and browse through the Robb Report
But ain't a car in that motherfucker I can afford
See niggas trying to block the road
Rather then my label drop ""The Growth"", they should drop us both (oh)
See I could scream Def Jam and what they used to be
But that ain't for me to say, that's for you to see (if it ain't)
If not Method Man or Redman, Ghostface, Young Gunz
Need I say Freeway, the proof is me
Still don't believe me, then where's Peedi Peedi
They ain't really giving a fuck unless you Jeezy
That's what my mind say
Just know if you ain't the President or Kanye, you won't see the time of day


I'm so thankful that
Come around these parts
We don't crank or snap, we aim and clap
Used to try to take the average rap fan, show 'em shit
But if they close-minded, who am I to open it?
Rather spend time with a bougie broad
Mean an actress, bad bitch, movie star
Shallow bitches, only into jewelry, cars
Still fuck with us, though that ain't who we are
Soon as my wife gone, they jump on the python
They ain't know I'm out to hit and run like Saigon
Putting back the ice on, had it screwed up
Finally figured out that hate is the new love
But I don't see how you get ahead that way
When you team up with Envy like Red Cafe
And all that blame is yours (nigga)
You trying to get a chain like floss
I'm trying to get a chain like stores
Find me in Jers, line for squeeze work off safety
Can't keep calm around these jerks, think beyond these words
Treat the hood like MySpace, either become friends with the Tommy first
So get found on the back of an empty carton
Spray semi larkins for the bread like Remy Martin
Don't mind me, ""Last of a Dying Breed""
Wanna take rap and bring it back to the '90's
+Juicy+ inspired me, +C.R.E.A.M.+ made me angry
+Get at Me Dog+ amped me, +Shook Ones+ ain't me
I already know it's a tough state to follow
When niggas use to stay up late to watch Apollo
Now it's ridiculous, all this shit's frivolous
Niggas ain't Macho Man, they Miss Elizabeth
Break a Corona bottle, make me an ill shank
Cut a bitch up like Bill Blanks doin still rank
 - (""that"" is replaced with ""this"" in last line)

The media'll say anything to get at you
Niggas is transparent, I'm lookin right past you
Henny is a bad dude, talkin 'bout he act rude
So my new tattoo is God with a gavel
Told baby girl if you wanna seduce me
Just know my brain works like a Bonaduce
My girlfriend say I use my charm too loosely
I tell her I'm too fly to have to con for coochie
Hella paper, tell a hater crib got a elevator
On the waterfront, so yeah I oughta front
Still times I feel like carryin chrome
Or cheatin the system like I'm Marion Jones
Tryin to +Sing For The Moment+, can't find the note
Put the game in a choke hold, can't find his throat
Hang with the big dogs, can't find the rope
They tell me it's alive, I can't find the pulse, so my


Oh, naw don't stop nothin (cocksuckers)
Taha, motherfucker
I don't even want shit (you in that mood yet?)
Keep my shit on
The whole point is fuckin have something to bitch about

Shout to whole On Top
Webb, Nitti
Cokeesi, what up?
Shout to my nigga Breezy, I see you
Skane Dollar, whole Desert Storm",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-roll-call-lyrics

We got some time and act like you isn't sure of that
C'mon don't tell me that we already endin'
And fuck I need to cheat on you for? I'm already winnin'

Once or twice maybe, forever you my lady my
You gorgeous but, it's more than just your hips that talk
Your strut, let's stall this for one more
It's how we laugh, you know shall we not
My better half slash your eyes the vibe we got, it's like

Nothin' wrong with arguin', but we havin' the same ones
Either you gon' ride out or you gon' spoil it
Either you gon' take a shit or get up off of the toilet
It's like

How many times I gotta tell you, boo, you all that I got
How many times I gotta tell you, be secure in your spot

Checkin' my two way, and goin' through my pants pockets

But when them tools go pop, and move whole blocks
Come around wit'cha dawgs, and get kujo shot

A good pair of shades on, you gon' always see me in disguise
Not for style, I don't want you to see in my eyes
Live for now

You see I just had to bury my man
Us two was on some brother shit (look)
But if I learned anything
If you take life for granted it'll grant you some other shit

I talk 'bout hardship like I discovered it (but I)

4 Walls,Mood Muzik 3: The Album,UnKnown,"See, me
I'm talking bout something called...
Something I like to call ""it""
Ain't really got a name for it
Only certain niggas suffer from this shit
Talking bout niggas that got like...
Niggas that got like a 6th sense
Sometimes you see shit that ain't there
Sometimes you hear shit ain't no body said nothing
Sometimes you think you somewhere and you really somewhere totally different
It's almost like you hallucinating
But you sober, you ain't high
No drugs and nothing like that
Sometimes you can BE high
Talking bout like some paranoia or some shit

Four walls, they surround me
Loneliness has found me
I'm waiting for you to return
Open the door, walk right on in
Darling let's start all over again

Look, I don't give a fuck again
Thoughts in my head
Looking like a nigga stuck with them
Wishing it abruptly ends
But God woke him up again
Everything is seeming so unfair, so unclear
Trying to reach out no one's there
Four walls tell em go run where no one cares
Screaming this too shall pass
Riding on fumes without gas
Bills piling up without cash
Tryna maintain and outlast
Pray for me, keep telling niggas patiently wait for me
Keep telling haters wait and see
I'm busy tryna fill a vacancy
Know a long time it's taking me
Muhfuckas keep mistaking me
Mistakenly, they caging me
Niggas never had no faith in me
Its like I'm one semi from death
I'm just a few pennies from debt
I got no identity left, victim of identity theft
Problems never new, it's revenue
Keep blaming 'em it's never you
Keep telling baby girl I'm gon' leave and never do
Cause even when a nigga needs space
When you looking for a little leeway
Somebody put it on replay
It's like it gets louder with each day, pray


Look, look
I'm tryna keep it formal now
But the pressure's on him now
I'll go ahead and warn you now
I'm tryna come across as normal now
All my life I've been called insane
Looked at as if I'm strange
Can't tame 'em
Can't blame 'em for looking at me as if I can't change
With that said, still I'ma rise
Though I keep it still in lies
Go ahead reveal your disguise
Maybe that'll kill the surprise
Sometimes I feel deprived
Starting when the guilt arrive
I noticed that the hills have eyes
When you on the heels of demise
And your man's on a ledge
Niggas tampering with my head
I ain't getting head in the Phantom
A phantom's in my head
Can't escape, figured I'd be a candidate
I ain't gotta upper-hand to date, can't be fate
Must think that I can handle weight
See I'm thinking of mansions, lakes
I was thinking Mandalay
Thinking I'd expand my stay
That's just the chance I'll take
Bow to my knees so the crowd's appeased
Put em in the mouth of the beast
Crazy they didn't make him out to be
I'm just tryna make it out at least, please


See what I'm talking bout
They ain't really got terms for shit I'm talking bout
I know they just diagnosed me with this shit
Like a, like an early age or shit
I don't mean four walls literally, nothing like that
Four walls, I'm talkin' bout
Ain't no windows. Ain't no sunlight. Ain't even a door
No locks, no nothing. Ain't getting outta that shit
You just try and get stuck
I'm talking bout four walls in your head baby
I know a nigga like me
I been talking about a nigga like me for a long time
Fucked up out here, can't even escape
We gon get em, nowhere nigga

Sing for the Moment Freestyle,Mood Muzik: The Worst of Joe Budden,2003,"Verse 1
Now first thing's first motherfucker, I don't know you
And lets put it in the air, get it clear, that I don't owe you
Nobody wants to start of from scratch with they own Pro Tools
They'd rather blow you, bring you to places you don't go to
The bad guy, because I refuse to remain local, or beef with the people I say no too, cause I'm the focal
I don't deal with you dudes who seem to think that I got my deal out the blue
Four years ago shit I was feelin' like you
With five bucks to my name, rips and tears in my shoes
Borrowin' outfits, no food starvin' that's mouse shit
But now that mouse on, nigga's act like the kitchen oven, didn't used to keep the whole house warm, I was without ohh
I ain't accept my flaws, beggin' the dealer for a hit, like please just accept my shorts
Nothin' mine except for my draws, they pegged me a loss, misguided, kid hopeless, they misquoted motherfuckers
Hook:
Sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear
Sing with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away
And A ohh ohh ohh
Walk with me
Verse 2:
The white folk, see my truck, start reactin' liking, get surprised, when yeah its a black kid driving
Thumbs up, now they start yakin, vibrant, asking me how'ss the traction they was interested in buyin'
Hood see me in it, say I don't deserve it, I'm not worth it, shouldn't have it, they should jack it
They think I'm flossing, with the windows down starin' at folks, you motherfucker, Joey sharin' the hope
And why in the mall, they eyein me for, like I stole items before, tah, nigga I could buy this store
And why when I'm walkin in the bank, tryin to get my good house and my mortgage and they think that I'm fraudulent
Think I can't afford it when the pores of my skin are dark and I'm a young buck, they think I got young bucks
Dumb fucks, so ignorant, think I only came to run muck, make me wanna resort to my ways somewhat
They say you soft when you move out the hood, so my goal is to make all of my loved ones punks
My pop, my mother, my son, his mother, my girl, my brother my entire squad, we'll be soft from afar
Haters wanna shoot me and graise me blocka
Caused I'm from the hood, but my mumma raised me proper
And if you hate Joey then you hatin the best
You hate yourself, you hate growth, hate success
Thinking of the hands on in the hallway cyphers
And I thank God, he knows he wasn't always like this
It gets better the more he guides us
You can tell cause the haters didn't always dislike us
Hook 2
Verse 3:
Joey offerin' substance
Without a mood or mind altering substance
That no longer alters my substance
I'm thankful for every single fan that I get
And just think, years ago, shit I was planning to quit
But nah, I'll keep troopin' it, for y'all at tripple dub Joebudden.com that type ""Joey keep doin' it""
Yall who though we wouldn't see shine in Jerz, for the kids that idolize me, just cause I can rhyme words
For y'all struggling, I know its hard getting by
For dude that said Calm Down, helped him stop getting high
For the gangstas, hustlers, mobsters that move weight
For dudes that followed Jumpoff from the first Clue tape
For all the credit that I'm not used ta, for the people saying I'm the future, thank you
Y'all help a nigga make it through the fake shit, even do it for the haters, you too can make it
For my niggas on the corner, giving me pounds and shit, for all the teachers said Joey wouldn't amount to shit
My mommy at my video shoot, she crying and all, for little man with the marker saying sign my ball
For all my true fans, all the people that support me, the people that adore me, when they could have ignored me

But one things for sure, we can have a rap discussion

Cut from a cloth that God made
Waring in the devils' land when I want to war knockin' 'I Pray'

Even through the mystici , keep the pope near
Was big out in L.E.S., this ain't Joe clear
Gossip gets deaded as soon as it hits Joe's ear
So the venom is caged, I'm underpaid
I can only give 'em minimum rage
I came up when all they respected is violence
If you know, it's something to be said in my silence
Only time we vacate is when we left for the islands
Stash in the bathroom, police severed the tiling
Got football numbers when the squad was pinched
Well deserved, we put Eagles in the cars and went
Listen, the fame you can keep
Some niggas became sheep
But before I ever snitch, I refrain from speech
All I hear is niggas talkin' bout Game and Meek
I'm in the crib thinkin' this entire game is meek
This shit has changed Ghost
They lowered the understanding
Prisoner of my mind claustrophobic in my mansion
But you and 'Kiss told me we gon' make it
Say whatever you want about him he don't fake it
You rarely see me out, I don't be most places
In bars it's still shit that real G's hold sacred, yeah
That's probably why they adore me though
Lastly before we go, 
rest in peace Shawty Lo",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-freestyle-lyrics
Warfare,Mood Muzik Vol. 3.5 ,2007.0,"You're now hearin hip hop at it's finest
I'm just criminal minded
The Ed Hardy with the fine fit (oh)
Track just started, no need to rewind it

Me, I'm bringin' fresh air back, I'm rap's heimlich
Got 'em all sick is that vomit?
Ew you nasty
Man I'll smack your skin if you feel you past it

It's like we lions against Lassies
Niggas ain't nice, they lyin, the flow ass cheek
I'm on the beat like Contra POW
Steamroll over shit, I'm in a Tonka now
This ain't about radio, see I'm beyond the dial
But still strong arm a nigga, E. Honda style (ow)

The inserts of your album put my ganja out
That sweeter than the lip gloss on Rihanna's mouth
Y'all sleepin, in pajamas on your momma's couch
I'm freakin, in the Bahamas throwin condoms out

Hold up dog, these felons ain't predicates, hands castle delicate
Metal spit, leave 'em on the field like Everett
 (oh)
I does my own stunts, like the Jackie Chan movie
Mismatch, belt Prada but the pants Louie
If you ain't fair to me, then your whole camp sushi
Rockin Iceberg when niggas didn't understand Snoopy
Damn moolies, chain of command's ran through me
You and your man uzi, +Slow Down+ like Brand Nubie
Can't do me, grant to me, like a man groupie
If that's the number one pick, then he Sam Bowie
And I hate to blow a homie on your mans
You ain't Kid Rock, can't box the Tommy with your hands
Motherfucker

I was really in the lobby with the grands tryna take guap
In the hallway, all day, is or it ain't hot
Listen to Hot 9, like what do they got
That I don't, With a blindfold I see everyone they say's hot
It's too easy, I'm feelin like I'm a cheater (why?)
The flow heavy, your's light like a slice of pita (haha)
When moms was pregnant she was lightin reefer
That's why I'm nice, in the middle of Alaska I'll write a heater
I'm just cool and rough, hoody matchin my Adidas
Pants with the permanent wrinkles like I am Ian Eagle
I will make every last one of you guys believers
Dudes is all lost, that's my word, I'm playin timer's keeper

Treat me like a big brother, slash fifth tucker
Let the cig snuff you, you a kid, fuck ya
Cocked AK, Mayday, listenin to +Dre Day+
Can't call me, dick in the mouth, somethin like Ray J
They like Steve Irwin up against the stringray
Heat up like Jean Gray, when somethin with the beans spray

Uh, take a sip of E&J, then a little puff or two
Get some butt, then kick out the slut, you's a bugaboo (haha)
Weak dressers, in the ring I'm Mr. Wonderful
Paul Orndorff, man y'all all soft and huggable
Y'all dealin with a pro here, that don't care
Y'all stiff and worn out like a closet with old gear
And I ain't goin nowhere
Producers know I'm the best thing over those snares
But you speakers whack, Ortiz I overdose like the needle's packed
I be's in a zone, then I give the speakers back

Hold up Joell, the +Ether's+ back
See I'm rap's Larry Johnson, redid my contract, now the Chief is back
So blame it on fatigue
Have you like Greg Oden, injured before your first game in the league
I'm spendin old faces, niggas took my style
Gotta steal my own shit back like O.J. did
Might size you and your spouse, have guys go in your house
With ridges on the nose of the rifle like Alf!

Outcast,The Album Before The Album,2007.0,"Stuck in the everyday struggle, only mines is hourly
Jungle full of wolves with a few lions that's cowardly
Used to make it hot, even that was too mild for me
School of hard knocks, tried to make the teacher proud of me
Sue me, script straight out of a movie
Toooolie, won't get kicked and pushed like Lupe
From groupies to housewives, from scams to skirmish
From sane to loco, from hustler to hermit
You let niggas plot and believe me they goin' try
My nigga been shot nine times and won't die
And so death threats become death threats
When they want you on your death bed and you ain't been put to rest yet
You in ICU
See the gunman in your head, damn can't wait 'til I see dude
Hate hospitals, I don't wanna go see dude
Know I love you to death, I feel it's no need to
In my mind there's bloody hallways and project windows
Dice games, thick clouds of project indo
Niggas creepin' off with the project nympho
Or plain clothes searching for some project info
Projects I resemble, so I don't stand out lookin' clean cut
Hangin 'round the project kinfolk
Cutthroats and liars, 
connects and suppliers
Fiends and they buyers, liquor store right by us
Kicks over the wire
If you Dave Blaine start choking in the water, send in the divers
Show dudes the real definition of survivor
In my mind I'm butt naked walking through the fire
Oxymoron, stubborn as a brick y'all
I'm a five star suite with the view of a brick wall
A high class scumbag, conceited nobody
Popular stranger, I see shit like nobody
A Tarrantino, Martin Scorsese
Coming up, I was that nigga they called crazy
In my hood, they like fuck em all, gotta pay me
Then get shot in the ass for thinking it's all gravy
I'm on my third C.I. now
And my bitch running round like she a P.I. now
Going through his phone book and his Levi's now
It's two choices, chillax or leave right now
That's how it be right now ain't ya ordinary rapper dude

Def Jam Diss,Mood Muzik: The Worst of Joe Budden,2003,"""Pump It Up"" came out, was a hit all over the country
And so I figured all over they'd want me (Yeah)
The buzz was there and the feeling was timely
And Kev said that he would put the whole building behind me (Yeah)
The whole office daps me freely
And Mr. Cohen always seems so happy to see me
I'm treated like a new man, musta got a facelift
This what I dreamed of welcome to the matrix
BET rated me ""Next"" we coming up Jersey
Air time, MTV Buzzworthy
If that ain't make things final
The song played all throughout the World Series and the NBA Finals
Wrap up ya album Joey it's goin out now
Only problem is my voice is goin out now
Doc said I need a surgery to fix it
And if something goes wrong it could be permanently TWIST-TED!
Now thats something I can't afford
So steroid shots in my ass just so I could record
The more I talk its ruining my cords and on top of it all
Now Def Jam wants ya boy on tour
This is important you can't back out
It's good exposure and 112's coming back out
I'm on their second single and they're on mine
I'm bout to shine June 10th yup it's time BUT WAIT!
Something must be wrong with the SoundScan
That's when it all started to go down man
Am I wrong or what here?
2 Fast Soundtrack did great and my song was on there
And things the way it seems
The Wow Vol. 7 commercial
Pumping It Up with my face on screen
Had to change my second single cuz theres two 112's/Joe Buddens
But theirs turned into 112/Luda
Lil Jon called me for the ""Get Low"" Remix
But Lyor was goin through some TVT shit
Then they went and kept Joe off of the ""Roc The Mic"" tour
Somebody probably thought Joey would rock the mic more
Left the country did a single with J-Lo
But with my luck I knew Columbia would say ""No""
Radio hates ""Fire"" nah they won't try it
But they love that Rah Digga song that sounds just like it
Wanna keep me under dog, I'm the underdog
And they don't want y'all to see up under the fog, so y'all
Tell every man in the hood
Gold album one single I'd say im doin hella damn good
Listen here Def Jam, are you deaf man?
Politics aside please don't interject fam
Listen to my shit now listen to the rest damn
I'm Taye Diggs, 
The Best Man
, thats without a ""Yes Man""
Three hundred thou budget I object fam
Did that the last time and I still repped damn
M.H. THANK YOU
Pharrell THANK YOU
Jim Jones THANK YOU
Lil Mo' THANK YOU
Sad part now is when I walk by
And I see Mr. Cohen he can't even say ""Hi""

Rest in Peace (In the Air),Mood Muzik: The Worst of Joe Budden,2003,"Chea, oh
Chea, uh
Chea, talk to 'em
Chea, G.C., rest in peace
Mojo, rest in peace
Champ gon' rest in peace
Little Reg gon' rest in peace
 Slick Senior, rest in peace
Keith gon' rest in peace

I need all y'all to rest in peace
All my niggas rest in peace, I need all y'all
I need all y'all to rest in peace
All my niggas gon' rest in peace


I know my dead homies watching upon us
But uh, I ain't gotta know a nigga to mourn
To see a real nigga crying is torture
Get the candles and the drinks, we gon' have our own wake on the corner
You could just vision (what?) all of the memories
Hennessy guzzlin' and you buggin' (why?,) because you was just with him
God called for his son, it was time
You got a beef with the Lord, wish you just saw 'im just one last time
Some think that nuttin' about it is good
He got what every nigga dreams of, he's out of the hood
So why we all sit in the hood cryin' liquor
He's in heaven laughing like, ""Look at my niggas
They all sobbing, them tears ain't stopping
God, throw 'em a sign that let 'em know I'm watching
Time passes and things get poppin'
Like he woulda wanted, if he was here that woulda been his option
It's back to old times as if he just popped in
If you had to take somebody, Jesus, not him
All my real niggas put a lighter in the air
There's a fighter in the air, that cloud right there
And I know my time is comin' like
Everybody elses, (but) but by then
I hope that everybody felt this, always that one
Hateful nigga make it seem like everybody's jealous
Somebody here don't like me breathin'
I know somebody here's tryna spite me steamin'
'Spite how I ride these sprees and dap me
Goin' to projects at the end of the night, I'm leavin'
One of my old mans who's now burnt out
Might off me, never know how things turn out
'Cause even your close friends'll steal ya
Come to think of it, I could be real cool with my po—tential killer
That's called taking the bitter with the sweet
The skip with the verse, the gift with the curse
Somebody wants to see the kid in a hearse
But I'd die for this rap shit, clips will disperse
Kill for this rap shit, it gets reversed
Murder you lethal, (so) so don't watch
If the convertible bleeds you
Take your pick with the clips, how you want it: reversible or see-through?
I be another locked dog in the fort
And another wake on the corner will be all my fault
Another body inside the Caddy
That'll make my moms right, 'cause I'll be in jail just like daddy
Daddy come home, somethin' ain't right
I think the Lord 'bout to call 'pon Uncle Mike
Mike got high and he wasn't too strong
Doc said he got cancer and it wouldn't be long
Said in another six-months he'll be gone
Pops still play that one gospel song e'ry morn'
Stopped gettin' high, so it's no more pipe
And they found medicine that would extend his life
Years pass and Mike's still here, he's not hurt
Gospel song e'ry morn', it's funny how God works
Wait! He's got the disease, he's different again
He's starting to get sick and shit's missing again
Now that monthly cheque he's spending again
Goddamn Uncle Mike is sniffing again
Dad, Mike's sprung and God put the cancer in his lungs
Like, ""Fuck that cure, you had a choice""
Disease is so cunning when you trippin' high
You can't throw away the gift of life, nigga, you take it or leave it
Nigga play it to keep it, nigga, sacred, treat it
'Cause if the Lord come take it you heed it
No funeral homes, not for you
And I don't really wanna visit in the hospital
Don't wanna see you like that, 'cause I'ma be too scared
I'd rather meet my own demise and meet you there
God, I can't make pretend
At least take me first, so I ain't gotta see you take my friends
Some things I can't even figure, like why you have to take him for?
Come on, God, answer me, nigga
Another tattoo, another name sprayed
On the back window of the car for a month
Another family shattered, in tears
Another night on my knees with a new name added to my prayers
Of all the things we still feelin', 'cause on a nice day
When the sky's clear I almost see y'all staring
Extend your arm, take this pound
To all my lost soldiers in the booth with me while I lay this down
C'mon

And I can feel it
Coming in the air tonight
Oh Lord
Well I’ve been waiting for this moment

All of Me Reprise,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Look, they say tomorrow's not promised, but if it was I wouldn't get open
Wouldn't get suits, them shits was made to be broken
Remember coming up, dudes talking bout hoes boasting
I was just a Juvenile, moving in Slow Motion
I dropped out of school to be a dude with mad jewellery
Once I got it, shit wasn't even cool to me
I dreamt of condo's and video vixens
Until I learned most the girls in videos is pigeons
I just wanted the world to see I was for real with it
Wanted a deal, got it but couldn't deal with it
I want me and my whole homeboys to still kick it
I wish they saw me as Mouse and not a meal ticket
Let the beat play, I wish I could see a day
With no he-say, she-say, I just wanna see Trey
Wanna play the Hood and not **** with the toasters
A middle child, wish me and my brothers were closer
I wanna scream at her, catch myself before I start to
And remember it takes 2 people to argue
All she do is provoke me, all I do is diss her
All I did was shake her, she said that I hit her
She just taking erry thing I say outta context
Im tryin' not to black, Im like a nigga with a complex
Was mad as a ****, didn't even show it
Yesterday was better off, didn't even know it
Complete role reversal, so it's useless these days
TV got real, music went fake..
Please help her for God's sake
When I proposed to the Game, I figured life was merry
5 Years later Im feeling like tyler perry
Maybe Im exhausted, maybe I just lost it
Maybe I should pick up a pen, try and force it
Same old story, guts and no glory
They try and low ball me, do em like Joe Torre
I reintroduce myself to the world, nigga Im Jerz
Im a artist, I paint pictures, I don't rhyme words
More then a rapper, I pay attention to detail
'Bout how I do in retail, tells me if I prevail
Been long since I seen this trials and tribulations
Foul situations with some male stipulations
I feel like being an addict is a curse
There's something bout dude that makes bad shit worse
Theres 3 types of niggas in this world, ya know?
So you either gon' make shit happen, watch shit happen
Or not know what happened
And so I couldn't just sit there like '**** rappin'
There's dudes with problems I couldn't imagine having
If I had to have them I couldn't fathom me lasting
Like, I used to bump into Tammy in the club
A few of them, she even help a nigga get in
See a person long enough, you know you bound to get fly with 'em
Care for 'em, be more than 'hi' and 'bye' with 'em
It's been a while, I can't front like I ain't phased
She was my reality check cuz we the same age
I mean, she put on a show that you CANT STAGE!
She made the shit sound effortless
I was damn near in tears checking my messages
I got goosebumps all over my skin
She said 'Mouse, I highly doubt that I'll ever see you again
Hope everything is well kid
See, Im just findin out I had a brain tumour, but I never felt it
The doctor's giving me 3 weeks to live
Not 3 weeks till I die, that's 3 weeks to give
I just wanna tell you that I love you and I care
I wish you all the best throughout the rest of your career'
And then she broke into tears
I pressed 7, took the phone from my ears
Sometimes the simplest of things, people need it
But I ain't call back in fear of being speechless
What was I to put her at ease with?
I picked a real bad time to be strategic
I think my life's bad picking up the pieces
Some folk already got their appointment to see Jesus
In this world full of diseases
I've learned not to bite my tongue or have seizures
Depression tells me I suck
So I reply 'I ain't here cuz I fell down, Im here cuz I got up'
And then Im going back and forth with Ransom
Shit came out of nowhere, was real random
According to him, Im responsible for Jerz too
I never helped niggas? How the **** you think they heard you?
Mutha****er's got a lot of nerve dude
I was the nigga believed in you spittin
Had to con the industry just so they would listen
But go 'head, you just gon' wreck yourself
How was you protectin me? You can't protect yourself?
Let's keep the lies to a minimal, just read your interview
I can't help but ask 'What's gotten into dude?'
Media training, but he don't know how that go
It help you come across not sounding like an asshole!
Then my past opened in Jail, I ain't enjoy it
So why would I stand behind a mic and exploit it?
I ain't ign'ant, just cuz I exercise spiritually
They try to ignore how I exercise lyrically
I thought I had a great job
Back when niggas loved the coach and wasn't in it for the money like A-Rod
Even when Im spittin bout current events
It's a sublime sayin 'who's more current than him?'
So Im wonderin if a higher power's tryin to undermine
When you shoot for the stars, sometimes you're gonna jam
I ain't been to SummerJam
I learned from Lupe, when you 'Dumb it Down' it's just harder to understand
2008, hoes is still near me
So you can think Im tired as a ****, Im still weary
The Getto Boys say it's 'All in the Mind'
Certain wounds only heal over time
No shame in my game, no pain no gain
And since I ain't seen a prophet (profit) I figured God would stop it
Waitin on the alley, niggas just won't lob it
Im still a risk taker, let me put it in words
Can't still 2nd base and keep your foot on 1st
Been about 10 years since I been high off the Angel
Now Im walkin side by side with an angel
In front of my eyes, that prize keeps getting dangled
But can't grab at it so my pride is being strangled
Workin shawty's nerves like a personal trainer
But it's me, its personal, it ain't her
Friends keep telling me 'leave her', I won't
Cuz she see's something in me that I don't
And I see something in her that yall won't
If you never been in love don't tell me Im wrong
See I preach gratitude, she keeps her attitude
Argue long enough then the shit becomes laughable
My norm now since for her it's so natural
Wish I could tell her that 'All the niggas after you!'
So not compatible that we're compatible
It's nothing else in this world that we would rather do
Anybody out there relate to my pain
Turn my music up and let me know that Im sane
We broke up, *****es was starin at my chain
Dude was ****in you but starin at my name
But we ain't gotta entertain all that
Back like we never left, we overcame all that
**** who made better tacos or who ass fatter
Let's live for now, right now none of that matters
We keep bringin it up it, it's gon' backlash us
Why am I meetin so many backstabbers?
Why when Im about to crash I go faster?
Past is a disaster
When your house is see-through, learn to close your eyes in case the glass shatters
Just sayin, its always a million more pages
When my stupid ass keep thinking im on the last chapter
No tip-for-tat, I ain't equipped for that

Freight Train,Escape Route,2009,"Yo, shakers, movers, haters, rapists, losers, liars, takers, shooters
With absurd dreams like Al who was 13
When he burst on the scene
That eventually hurt him
Got a tool, he stole from dad
Thought it'd be cool
To play show and tell so he took it to school
He in class with it, stylin for mad bitches
Nickle bag lifted, its sad cuz he mad gifted
But that biscuit will only lead to bad business
Moms on dope, dads just ridiculous
That leaves a Menace, wantin' to be Caine
But they one in the same both runnin' from pain
But the laughter it fell from his face
When it fell from his waist
And hit Ramell by mistake
Tried as an adult, facin a long bid
But the charge might change gotta see if the lil boy lives

Then it comes to be that the soothing light at the end of your tunnel
Was just a freight train coming your way

Yo, self-pity, chasin, wealth
Could be sickly if you fend for yourself in city like Nitty
Who sold dope his whole life, the nigga sold dope to his own wife
He knew her death would come soon
Bein real how much drugs could she consume
Even hid guns in his sons' room
But they don't know its a secret believe it
He don't want them to get hit the way that he did
House raided, drove by the house sprayed it
Ran in stole his stash, spouse naked
Its real here, he thankful that he still here
Caught'em nine times he'll easily take the wheelchair
Old hustla's can't escape old madness
Get the same results dealin' with old habits
Which makes Nitty a lifetime sufferer
Who thinks it'll be a'ight since he lives with his very best customer
Hook
Then it comes to be that the soothing light at the end of your tunnel
Was just a freight train coming your way

Yo, his spite is vintage, more so extensive
Revenge is best served cold but its expensive
Near steps, to revenge is near death
He disappears stressed reappears with a TEC
You kill his dog, he gone kill your cat
His pops killed his mother so he killed his dad
In his head he like god damnit he crept over
With the same gun his pop planted that he slept over
Raised as a killa from an age that's a thrilla
Age with no filta and that rage is familiar
Now fate has him sleepin' over that guy
Responsible for that black patch over his eye
Pillow over Al's face he leaned over and cried
He sighed and said ""Your parents won't know that you died""
Death penalty, no amnesty just insanity
Clock ticks on the last member of his immediate family

Then it comes to be that the soothing light at the end of your tunnel
Was just a freight train coming your way",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-freight-train-lyrics
So Serious,Mood Muzik 2: Can It Get Any Worse?,2005.0,"You niggas couldn't fuck the broads I choose
Couldn't push the rides that I cruise, niggas couldn't tie my shoes
I've been all around the world
You niggas ain't men, y'all are girls, niggas couldn't bench what I curl
Shouldn't be a question about your favorite rapper
And my label got me questioning my favorite rapper
So I, bogart, one man gang, no squad
No Cialis needed to go hard, listen
It's not rappin, I'm spittin bout everythin that happened
In a few bars, twenty five years get packed in
No regrets til my days up
Can't be Pat Ewing lookin back on that lay-up
When you hood like me, you pull up in that Taurus
Still turnin down pussy, you get too many offers
My guards up, too many crossed us
Nowadays, not enough chiefs and it's too many bosses
I'm forreal wit it
Everybody can't be a boss man
Everybody can't have weight
Somebody gotta have bags
Everybody can't have a brick, somebody gotta have an O around here somewhere!
Man lets just be forreal about it
As if y'all needed to be reminded
I don't look for trouble, I just help a nigga find it
A & R feel like everybody the one
I walk around feelin like everybody my son, one
Shorty feelin the God, I can't blame her
And kicked down the door and came through like Kramer (word)
Now find a nigga better than that
I walked out the movie ""Saw"" and started settin my trap
And I don't yap about how I move wit all the guns
Like a hustlers dance, can't do that where I'm from, son
Talk to me, if it's about a buck, heavy cream
On my Eric Benet shit, fuck everythin!
They thought I would go astray, but I won't
David Banner may have time to play, but I don't
Cause I spit the cane wit ease
And I can't just freeze not until this whole game's febreezed

Dear Angela,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Yo, what's goin' on?

Whatever we had going
Ain't showing anymore
Where there used to be laughter
Now there's only pain

I never thought it would end
Called you my soulmate (Uh-huh), thought you'd become my wife
Together forever, nobody could tell me otherwise
Now I look back (What?), remembering all the tears from your eyes
Those were the three longest years of my life, I had to put 'em in song
Should of known that we couldn't whether the storm
When you and moms ain't get along, how could you be the one?
Or maybe (What?) I was in need of your touch
Fresh off of a drug addiction, maybe I just needed a crutch
Inseparable us, no matter what looked out for the kid
I never thought you'd point me out to the pigs, my girlie special
Both of us was acting confused (Uh-huh)
Said we'd have a child together (Why?) so our families would have to approve
But prior to you miscarried (Thank God) I wasn't ready for a kid
I was only working stock at the wiz, it's backwards
I just wanted to help you
Couldn't take you comin' to me sayin', ""Mouse, there's somethin' I gotta tell you
Sit down""
[Chorus: Crystal Gayle & 
Joe Budden
]
Whatever we had going
I ain't want it like this
Ain't showing anymore
But I tried, I tried my hardest
Where there used to be laughter
But you slipped, you  some other shit
Now there's only pain
Listen

All I wanted in my better half (What?), I thought that I found her
Even though we argued the pussy was the best that I encountered
I tried to put the BS past me
So we could live in this same house happy (But then what?), but then you stabbed me
Ambulance, ER, don't know what I'ma do (Uh-huh)
Tube in my dick (Tell 'em), scared, still all I wanted was you
Damn my thinking was sick back then
I left the hospital, you came home from jail, we'll be united again
Bed ridden, I just wanted to see you (I love ya)
Pleadin' but you tryna leave, ""Don't go Angela, please, I need you""
I ain't think you'd throw it,  (Why?) but you gave me a motive
Look, I'm sorry, but I couldn't control it (I'm sorry)
I know I called you named I promised I'd never call you
(But) You said some shit, good thing my dawgs got me up off you (Uh-huh)
Left me with a lot of thoughts, every other day it's somethin' new
Like, ""Joey, we gotta talk, this ain't working out""
[Chorus: Crystal Gayle & 
Joe Budden
]
Whatever we had going
Nah, uh-uh, not again
Ain't showing anymore
I don't wanna hear that
Where there used to be laughter
I'll work it out, I'll fix things
Now there's only pain
 what happened?

You threw my clothes out the window (Uh-huh), what I did? Throw your clothes out the window
How the fuck I end up in jail? (I don't understand)
Just like that, ma, you at the precinct with my son
He ain't have to see his dad walk in cuffs like that (Uh-huh)
Learnt my lesson, on one hand you gave me such a beautiful seed
But on the other hand he's used as a weapon
Why things have to change for the worse? (Uh-uh, uh-uh) Scratch that
They really changed after birth, I guess you got what you wanted
A bad breakup's like murder, when it comes down to it
I know I put you through hell, you gotta know it's vice versa
But we ain't gotta hate each other (Nah), I tried to make it work
I wanted a family, not just a baby mother
Look, the lust was gone, the trust is gone
Come to grips with the thought of us is gone, it's more than just a song
I'm good now, you not the only one fed up (Uh-huh)
But rather than us talk about it I'll just write you a letter
Dear Angie

Whatever we had going
Ain't showing anymore
Where there used to be laughter
Now there's only pain",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-dear-angela-lyrics

""Biatch!""
""For you! For, for you! For-for you! For you!"" - ""Fresh!"" {*repeat 3X*}

Nickel! Of course it's I
The four ship come as no surprise
I'm loffin' my chauffeur drive
He married to the streets, he 'bout to divorce his bride
Now throw 'em up! Like you praying to the porcelain god
Joey!

I understand why dudes would wanna off me (why?)
It's small beef, goldfish to Jaws' teeth
Knick game, next to Spike, got the floor seats (talk to 'em)
Expired tin plate but the Porsche speeds
Home to wall-to-wall marble in the floor see, Nickel!
 + (Joe Budden)
Spittin at your eulogy
All you rhyme about is shine and jewelry
You should change your name from MC to Tomfoolery
This is new to me and I will mop a nigga ass UP!
Do him like clean-up
(Or split him down the middle, we could) Do him like a pre-nup
(I mean get him for his re-up) Hoes down, G's up

Clean cut, pour something hot on your mean mug
Star Trek guns outta this world, get beamed up
The last two that you want to see team up
Or link up, FUCK any rapper you think of
Matter fact, ain't a better combo you could dream of

 Street niggas gettin money, this is {""For you""}
 Jail niggas waitin on release, this is {""For you""}
 Hoh! Trap stars niggas, this is {""For you""}
 Fruck that, bad broads I'm doin it for {""For you""}
 WE, ARE {""Fresh""}

We killin the witness and anyone who maybe saw it
So the court date (they missin the day before it)
Lately flourish coupe, or maybe Porsche it
I'm aware that they hate me for it
I stay with the special like Katie Couric
Diss me, soon as they record it they be corpses

Flawless models lookin like my lady's porcelain
80's corset that can cause a baby abortion
Take her, to Old Navy or maybe Nordstroms
Get her pregnant, marry her or maybe divorce her
Crazy, if a nigga dandelion
I have him pushin up daisies in a fugazi orifice

I dress half hood, half corporate
If your closet ain't the size of a master bedroom you won't get the portrait

Bottom line I'mma sign like endorse it
Y'all niggas four different characters played out like Norbit
Of course it's the bosses, shoot it then toss it

Last Real Nigga Left,Mood Muzik Vol. 3.5 ,2007,"Look-
Everybody wanna talk about who's the nicest
A bunch of grown ass men in a midlife crisis (ughhh!)
I don't really see what all the hype is
You got some 'G-Money' ridin' around in them Chryslers?
Guess they still sleeping, bad case of the itis
Be Siegfried then Roy fuck around with them tigers
Listen...

I don't think its no real niggas left (ah huh)
I feeling like its no real niggas left (ohhhh; nahhh)
Or maybe all the real niggas just left- or
Or maybe I'm the last real nigga left
See I don't understand why nigga's act this hard
Some niggas is ""BALLLLIN"" with the practice squad
They don't holla at'cha mans
'Cause nigga hit and run like Carmelo, I'm assumin' they in La-La Land
I'm talking BLOCKA, man! 10 deep in that DollaVan
And won't leave until you Aqua, man
I done seen it all, done it all- what they gon' tell dude?
Once you try to marry the game, they Sean Bell you
Rather you in Bellview, cops wanna derail dude
Like Jenny Aniston up in that hotel room (ohhh)
One man chain gang, bitches wanna know what's his AIM name
Niggas wanna see about his aim game (talk to 'em)
All this yappin' about holdin' M's
Get ya weight up, you lookin' like the Olsen twins
A bunch of vague ass niggas, I'm WAY past niggas
Treat me like a Prince, Morris Day ass niggas
Hundred miles and runnin', duckin' a court summons
Albums? Just one in!; Livin' like Mr. Drummond
Nigga's gon' learn about puttin' me in they speech
When every dead president they own'll be impeached
(Even) J.C. murder rate'll be increased
Throw a nice suit on 'em, and let 'em be in peace, geez!

I don't it's no real nigga's left (nahhh)
I'm feeling like it's no real nigga left (ah huh)
Or maybe all the real nigga's just left- (ok)
Or maybe I'm the last real nigga left
He wanna pop shit, about how he cock it- its gossip; stop it!
Ain't nothing about you that says ""Brolic"" (nahhh)
I hear ya lil freestyles talkin' about you buy tools (dawg!)
You just a lil nigga, known you since high school
I made niggas, aside from that I'm a made nigga
Sent you to the store for me, you was like my maid nigga
You outta ya league, you fuckin' wit a Don
These Urkel ass niggas is turnin' into Stephon
How hungry, B? You scrub money to me
You livin' wit' moms, you more like Bud Bundy to me
Might clap 'em up, revolve 'em
You like my Lil Scrappy, and you don't want No Problem
He broke, you can't rob him
It's Joe, you can't stop him! (nope)
Not unless the feds grab me-
You want 60 Minutes? Treat 'em like Ed Bradley
And his squad know, I'm ridin' on horses
Yours is like Barbaro, how you want a part of Joe?
Can't get in this game, maybe at half-time
You not a livewire more like a flat line
You livin' in a mean world
Bitch niggas sit around hopin' for a deal, I'm callin' 'em all ""Dreamgirls""
Clap Joe? Never the day
And before you put my name in your mouth, have something better to say!!
I mean...

I don't it's no real nigga's left (nahhh)
I'm feeling like it's no real nigga left (ok)
Or maybe all the real nigga's just left- or
Or maybe I'm the last real nigga left
Look, you muh'fuckas makin' me laugh, at least chuckle
Weight of the world on 'em, knees won't even buckle
And dudes think they causin' an uproar- fuck Y'ALL!
And this impotent disses, ain't even gotta get up for
If I wanted you dead, I'd hire a nigga
Ain't gettin' my hands dirty, tryna fire at niggas (and- sooooo)
Fuck dustin' off the MAC again
When you meet your Final Destination, its gon' look like a accident
Niggas ain't making it hot, they might sizzle
And don't confuse Making It Rain, with like drizzle
Care less about what chart he on, I'm so far beyond
Wit' a heart like Omarion, for you maricons
Underground legend, ahead by eons-
Fitted white tee on, Couple hundred G's on
Pee on peons, skate off in your Scion
I'm coughin' up acid, you spittin' up Freon
Send slugs flying, have ya brains leakin' on ya chain
Since niggas wanna rock these Blood Diamonds (talk to 'em)
And anybody thought I fucked wit' dudes
Just lettin' me know- they took the short bus to school
Put some mills on that-
They say ""Hip Hop Is Dead"", but the real is back
Now how real is that?!
... I mean, uhhh

I don't it's no real nigga's left (nahhh)
I'm feeling like it's no real nigga left (ah huh)

The Future (MM2),Mood Muzik 2: Can It Get Any Worse?,2006.0,"How y'all feeling out there?
Maybe y'all ain't hear me...
I said how is everybody feeling out there!?!?
Y'all alright?
I'm feeling...
Dub B is sooo soulfulllllll
Nah mean..
This is what you call mood muzik right here..
I'm feeling....
(oh.....)
Incredible
(unhhhh)
C'MONNNN

Whoaaaaa..... that's what the future holds in me..
Don't you wanna stay

I feel like I'm ahead of my time, like I'm ahead lets rewind
I feel like I've never fell feel like I'm ahead of my prime
I feel like my feelings feel like they maybe feel intertwined
'tween incognito and shine I'm being caught in the lime
Feel like I'm stuck in a fight when the future ain't feeling bright
I put the pencil down, feeling unwanted, and go on strike
But then I'm struck by the light that ain't how you properly strike
But the ball be over the plate and they still don't call it a strike
I mean I honestly try, I feel like I try in vain
Start doing a little different shit always just stay the same
There's a good in every bad when there's loss I know there's gain
I appreciate the love but I'm living with all the pain
I hate when the sun is out, but love whenever it rains
And God be sending me signs like my future is preordained
My timing keep getting fucked, then why I still haven’t came
And all I do is object but my shit ain't never sustained
Wonder if I keep on trying then will I finally attain
Wonder if I'll ever feel like I got nobody to blame, MAYNE!

How's everybody doing out there?
Y'all good?..
I'm great

I told mommy when I was five that I would strive to be a lawyer
Or a doctor took the opt. to hanging out with the mobsters
Now he's a hip hop'sta, no more general Tso's
Ordering shrimp and lobster mommy look at how I prospered
Look at what I've become but still I feel like a bum
Emotional strain can't be replaced by any sum
Emotionally drained, insides prolly look like a slum
Just give me a bag of weed, just give me a shot of rum
No better yet give me none, no mommy I won't succumb
Not that- almost forgot I stopped that when I was young
Some people do it for pleasure some people do it for fun
But I remember it well, that dust used to have 'em strung
I wonder what I've become but why am I overlooked
I want 'em to understand but still I'm misunderstood
I keep on taking suggestions I'm wondering if I should
I know you see the potential, I know you see that I could
Bumping Ludacris, 'Child Of The Night' was well put
Why does everything so bad for me feel so good

I hope everybody still alright..

I know niggas that never made it everybody would sweat him
He jumped out the whole park, NBA never met him
What good is being open if the guards never fed him
He'd have been the illest nigga but niggas just never let him
Maybe Trey'll grow up and be somewhat of a star
Wearing all the latest things and pushing the latest cars
Maybe he'll hold me down same way I do for my father
Or really resent me, feel like why should he even bother
Maybe me and his momma will finally just get along
Maybe not, but the idea sounds good in a song
Maybe one day the world'll see how great he performs
Long journey to walk on my feet to take the corns
Open my mind, say you was right and I was wrong
Nah, that's wrong, one day I'll rightfully right my wrongs
And start over anew like that one night I was born
Show a girl I really care, one day that pride'll be gone
See he overcame a lot, he just the same as his pops
So one day he'll be alright when that rain finally stops, C'MON!!

How's everybody feeling out there?
Huh?
Aaaoooowwww
Huh?
Are you in that mood yet?
Maybe y'all ain't hear me
Are you in that mood yet???!!
Owww
I know I am
Talk to 'em

Something From Nothing!,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Sometimes I hear death knocking at my front door
I'm living every day like a hustle
Another drug to juggle
Another day another struggle
Yo, I know it's fucked what a lack of cake will do
A few people want to move in and stay with you
You wish you could help them more you unable to
Cause the rents a little late and the cables due
You and your girlfriend are beefing in a serious way
You used to be faithful you in a curious stage
Finally got your mind made of going your separate ways...Wait!
Nah homeboy her periods late
Now think
Times running out do it quickly
Cause she start crying moods getting sticky
If I don't want it she'll want nothing to do with me
Just get the abortion and I give you the 250
But if you say that to her then you wrong
You didn't think about that you was getting ya groove on
I can't take care of myself never mind a new born
I guess that pussy got too good for too long
Seem like my money goes by too easy
Why I hate that my job only pays bi-weekly
My hooptie done shitted
You spending more money trying to fix it
Then what you did with trying to get it
The fridge is empty but I survive the hunger
Who the fuck keeps calling from this private number?
There's crime on my mind and my nails are dirty
But the floors are real cold in the jails of Jersey
Depression starts talking and his voice is raspy
Cause he ain't shut the fuck up in 3 1/2 Weeks
Look, beard is full, hair is nappy
These jeans ain't mine so they way too baggy
Priorities fucked, nigga's startin to gas me
It's like my whole life just flipped right past me
Starting to trap me
His names Dwayne, so why the fuck my son keep calling him daddy?
Same shit that I feared after all of these years
I gotta breathe I can't believe my ears
Wiping out my eyes I'm damn near in tears
But you can't be mad cause you know you ain't been there
Nah, you grab his moms up throw her against the door
But in the back of your mind you know it ain't her fault
Nah, I ain't mad at all I'm just bothered
I get honest for real I ain't been the best father like
Toys""R""Us, Chuck E. Cheese
You know a little nigga grow up with these needs
New Years or Christmas even a birthday
Least bring a nigga to his school on the first day
I can't believe it, this the same way that I was treated
So maybe it's history repeated
I know it sound sick
The idea of having another kid
Cause this one you'll really feel like is his
It's the truth and I hate that fact, wait
I shouldn't of said that
I take that back I apologize
Let's rewind this whole story like nah C4 just erase that track
Check it, I don't care if only the track trust me
Fuck what niggas say only god can judge me
Fuck what niggas heard or think or even thought
Tried to fix my shortcomings I just came up short

The Soul,Halfway House,2008.0,"Same characters but the show's different
Just listen, it feels like the soul went missing
I remember copping that compact disc just to take off the wrapping
It was more then rapping
Read credits, till every name's embedded
One day, I'm a be just like them, bet it!
One day, I'm a come and lace the team
With their favorite things when I grace the screen, coasting!
I mean, it's nothing like what I was hoping
No emotion, we just going through the motions
I used to watch the videos just to see the new shit
Wanted to see it first, I thought I'd be exclusive
Remember getting hyped off my first Casio
Suped up writing my first verse, it was ass though
Acappella, no beat and a bad flow
Damn I miss the good ol' days, when we had soul

I remember each day putting my fav song on replay
But my tape deck would always eat tapes
I'd put my finger in the middle trying to fix it
Just for the shit to end up sounding twisted
Pressing clothes before school, I was matching
Liked the girl in class, got mad when she was absent
Wasn't a baller and I ain't have no game
So what could I do besides ignore her?
Or,my first fight with no brothers to get
I remember being scared as shit and he had all this lip
And I ain't have hands not a bit
Just knew that I ain't wanna get hit
So staring at the clock, I ain't trying to see 3 o'clock hit
But I never found the back door
Him? He ended up with a tapped jaw
As for me? I ended up with that bad broad
Damn, I miss the good ol' days, I wish we had more

Maybe I'm feeling like a kid today
I mean, I used to want to have a house party watching House Party, Kid & Play
I had the low tops, kicks and the fades
I remember my first piece of ass from a hot chick
Surprised she gave it to me, was shocked I got it
Ol' girl image of me was all ruined
Had to be thinking ""the fuck's this boy doing?""
So hard I flirted just to be all nervous
Wish she could see me now, I'm so perverted
I tell her ""I'm so glad I found you
Are you ready for round two? Or can I mount you?""
In old pics I used to look like a clown dude
When I had know idea what I'd amount to
A nigga used to be out of control
Man, I miss the good ol' days, when we had soul",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-the-soul-lyrics
Go to Hell,Halfway House,2008.0,"Joey!
Tahaha
That N.J. bullshit, I'm on it
I'm on the same shit I've been on really
Niggas probably just ain't know I was on it
Amalgam, look here
I mean (oh!)

Still regular, just stuck in a rapper's body
Made some bread off this shit but still rap's a hobby
I never got an invite, I had to crash the party
Now it's just models inside, I'm at the after party
I set trends, here's somethin for the fags to copy
Suc-ceed and everybody from the past gets salty (but I)
I get in the booth and own that bitch
Won't stop 'til all my brothers are Jonas rich
Or wealthy, not rich, fuck it, see I aspire to be Mr. Buffett
Warren, not from just tourin
I used to grind, hustle hard for some hot Jordan's ('til)
'Til my mind went beyond and all that got borin
The streets watchin but it's outlook is not important (nah)
I'm tryin to pocket a fortune without the stocks soarin
If you ain't into gettin paper, let it be (just know we)
Just know we too parallel to every meet, think about it now (oh!)

You can go to hell
You can go to hell
You can go to hell
You can go to hell

Ya mean?
I never really cared for what, mother, other motherfuckers had to say about a nigga
I ain't never really gave a fuck
I got a place all you niggas can go
A first class tickets for all you niggas
Not even coach (goin), cocksuckers

They say he can't come to the hood, he got ran out
How's he livin so good? His money should've ran out (nah)
Figured he'd be thirsty for a hand out
Or livin at his man's house, none of that ever panned out
Call him fake ass
Say ""he as fake as, his girl's fake ass""
Say ""we don't hear him on the radio and he ain't been out in so long
Dude can't even rap"", you couldn't be so wrong (Joey!)
Got a different type of censorship
So whatever I'm blessed with, I don't mention it (I don't even mention it)
That shit is soft (plus)
And my motto is when you get inside the end zone, act like you've been there before
Says somethin about your character to always brag
So if you never had, act like you always have, for real
Here's somethin to adhere to, be careful
Cause with so much dick in your mouth, it's hard to hear you, pause


Look what you niggas made me do
Had to pause somethin
Ya mean?
I don't even be on no pause bullshit neither
I'm a grown ass man, I ain't even got time for it but
Every now and then you gotta make an exception!

Look, they say don't argue with fools, me I do it for debate sake
I'm the nigga that embrace hate
Take a minute, think about how much ya cake weigh? (and then)
Then know I'm on your mind havin a great stay (and then)
Actually, I hope to never have to vacate
You see I'm much more vaca than AK
How you premeditate hate? (nigga)
At least have the balls to nay say when a nigga face to face
Let's see if you still wanna disrespect the King, savior (I doubt that)
I'll introduce you, in case you never seen a razor
All that mean behavior
Have whatspoppin.net at ya wake and use the pic for my screensaver (nigga)
See I ain't losin no sleep
You a small piece of bark and I'm on to the whole tree
And please, know there's never been a nigga more ""I don't give a fuck"" than Joe is
Even before show biz (oh!)


Cause what I always try to explain to a nigga
Niggas like a small thing to a giant
It's like minute, it's like
I'm lookin at so much other shit like
Fuckin mental midget niggas man

Mami, I'm there if you fine in the rear

And when I'm done slidin', you somethin' fierce
You ain't gotta go home but you gotta get the fuck outta here

I ain't got to tell homeboy, he know that
This is 'Matrix Reloaded' and Neo's back
I'm up, humble apologies, sorry clowns
I'm here for the long run, I ain't Koffee Brown
Get to know me, the man, the person
So by the time I'm on my fifth album
You should understand the first one
It's non-fiction, you deny you want proof
I only buck in the air when the sky's in the booth
You gets liable to shoot
This twenty-two release some extra keyholes on the driver's side of your
Coupe
Like, nighty night, here's your lullaby bitches
You might need just a lil' more than butterfly stitches
Get out of line and get stuck up duke
Lose your spines tryin' to touch us jukes
Get to the mall in a circle, guns out playin' ""duck-duck-goose""
This shit is kinda aiight till I fuck in the booth
I'm sayin', I'm here, got my nine up in here
Thugs wanna rumble, I don't mind, nigga yeah

And when I'm done slidin' up somethin' fierce
You ain't gotta go home but you gotta get the fuck outta here

Like I don't roll with niggas that'll lift 'ayn' chrome
Take a look at 'em, you can see they just skin and bones
Y'all talk about bricks when y'all know who move 'em
Us real niggas make withdrawls while y'all go through 'em
We carry long guns, we can contra on it
We talk about it, we live it, y'all ponder on it
Shit, ridiculously priced, us cons afford it
I'm talkin' straight cash, you might need a sponsor for it
But wait - ever met somebody that wouldn't chill
Every second he feel the need to let you know that he's real
Every second he wanna talk about his homies that died
And the people he killed and in the future all the people he will
Talk about who he stabbed and beat up, and he won't cool out
Yakety-yakkin', he's reminiscing on different shootouts
How he was there, shotties was blastin'
Cops came with body bags, and he's talkin', but nobody asked him
Naw - he want attention, he want his name yelled
Me and him always end up in the same cell
I'm pissed on the top bunk, I can't sleep
This guy ain't street, go 'head nigga I ain't beef
But feel me - stop there, who popped him where
Who you backed out on and had the whole block scared

Ma when I'm done pokin' you from the rear
You ain't gotta go home but you gotta get the fuck outta here

Ma - you real aggressive, catchin' me of balance
It's a turn off, don't you know niggas respect a challenge
Move a lil' slow gettin' at me
Treat the pussy like it's worth somethin', don't just go throwin' it at me
Cuz - while you doin' it at the same time
I'm thinkin' how many niggas hit you wit that same line
Or - how many other niggas you ran game to
How many niggas you fucked or you gave brain to
How many other dudes houses you done came to
With condoms on you hopin' that he find 'em on you
And - I ain't tryin' to catch nothin' from you
So I'm caught up in a Catch-22
If I don't fuck her then I'm not like guys she met before
So while I'm turnin' her down she's just likin' me more
But if I do get to pokin', hit her with long strokin'
I now have a girlie on my hands that's open
I don't want her callin' me constantly
Thinkin' cause I fucked her she got a bond with me
I don't want her misunderstandin' a one night stand
It was just a nut, I'm not your man

Ma - I'm there, if you fine in the rear
We can get into whatever if you don't mind boo be yeah
And when I'm done slidin', you somethin' fierce
You ain't gotta go home but you gotta get the fuck outta here

She said she wanna go somewhere (and get familiar)
Joe no good (but I want ya)
I know this girl ain't shit, but I'm still tryin to hit
I said I want a one night (ohh) a one night (ohh) a one night fuck
See I know this girl ain't shit, but I'm still tryin to hit

L-look, look; any place I visit I got hoes there
How you wan' go there?
Model face hopped on the scene stupid
Made for TV, should come with theme music
She play the club on a regular basis (I mean)
Had some work done in a few different places
I knew it when I seen how small her waist is
Tasteless, but no matter what y'all taste is
Y'all would wanna taste it; Macy's make-up
Shorty work the day shift, play like she evasive
You know her type, always front like you can't get it
Even though I heard the stories how my man hit it
My man did it in front of the cam wit it
He said he jizzed on her, sent her 'bout her damn business
I see her out and I don't even say hi
You Barkley and Wade her; put her in your ""fav' five""
But I'll be a liar to say that she ain't fine
So I answer when she call and hit me with that same line, c'mon
 w/ ad libs

Yo, she keep the shades on, lookin like she high or some'n
Love the strip clubs, I think that she bi or some'n
Brand named out, closet full of lavish furs
Cause dudes trick on her, she act like the cash is hers
Not at all playa, I'll still jump, not foreplay her (dawg)
She'll fuck you if you could jump, you know, ballplayer
Share taker lookin for a caretaker (to what?)
To lace her once a week, take care of that hair and make-up
Somethin like a cash cow, drink 'til she pass out
I think I seen her online with her ass out
Freak shit, but look better than broads
Give head better than broads, pussy get wetter than broads
So naw, can't come at baby on some cheap shit
Now e'rybody beat it, she come off conceited
Peep it, if she gon' be the one you leave with
Do it on the low and keep that y'alls lil' secret
 w/ ad libs

Knahmean? That be his favorite girl
Look - I mean B cup, C cup, D cup, curves
Groupie, chickenhead, jumpoff, birds
E'rybody onto me, so I already know when she come onto me
She gon' say she don't do this normally
You got her at the Steakhouse doin it formally (me?)
I give her takeout, she'll take the place of a porn for me
High-saddity ho, tryin to be in videos
Real popular, she the one the whole city knows
Say it to her face, she get defensive, lawyer
Sendin naked pics, exhibitionist, voyeur
Know the routine, so she leave when we finished
Then I lie every time like, ""I'ma call you in a minute""
F'real

It's obvious that the girl is poison
She already ran through all my boys and
I know that it would be best just to stay away
But she's tellin me
 w/ ad libs

What you doin tomorrow?
Oh you busy tomorrow? Yeah me too
Tahaha; how 'bout the next day?
You know I'mma just give you a call next week or somethin like that
And see what you doin
See if you free like next week or somethin

World Takeover,Mood Muzik 2: Can It Get Any Worse?,2005.0,"Whoever thought that, taking over the world would take
Longer than 3 years
I know I didn't shit
Matter of fact it ain't, it ain't been 3 years yet
Well the takeover is coming
I know you hear 'em coming
It feel like '03 yet?
You in that mood yet?!?!
I just like sayin that shit
That shit just sound good
Jersey!
The king of New Jersey
World Takeover
You got some wanna shoot 'em on site then there's some wanna *scratches*
Some wanna shoot 'em on site *scratches*
Some, some wanna shoot 'em on site *scratches* Some
Some wanna shoot 'em on site then there's some wanna shank me
Put him out to dry, you got some wanna hang me
Then I pissed 'em off, or made some of 'em angry
All I did for this hood I THOUGHT niggas would thank me
And I could give a fuck bout where none of you rank me
Him, him, them, son none of 'em ain't me
I worked hard to get here, now that I got here
They want me gone, they tryna treat Joe like a Yankee
*gun shots* 
Some wanna shoot 'em on site then there's some wanna shank me
Put him out to dry, you got some wanna hang me
Then I pissed 'em off, or made some of 'em angry
All I did for this hood I THOUGHT niggas would thank me
And I could give a fuck bout where none of you rank me
Him, him, them, son none of 'em ain't me
I worked hard to get here, now that I got here
They want me gone, they tryna treat Joe like a Yankee
Mic check 1,2
I say what I mean, I mean what I say what I feel
Do whatever I want to
Got into something you can't undo
I piss in whatever subway your train of thought gotta run through
I'm by my lonely, so I might let the hawk show
Any block, I double-park, get out and walk slow
And nowadays niggas like listenin to bullshit, its obvious
Even Tyra got a talk show
Left the Sidekick home, took the old school pager
I wanna believe there's no such thing as a hater
Do something for somebody, they expect something in return
Now there's no such thing as a favor
Soon as I stop smoking, blunts come out in flavors
I think of New Orleans when I step out in gators (talk to 'em)
Some dudes starving, their ribs just keep touchin
My shoulder nicknamed me Chicago, I keep brushing
E'ry nationwide artist ain't national
Rappers appear to be dicks that really vaginal
E'ry Capo out there ain't seeing capital
And everybody's rationale really ain't rational (oh!)
So when I'm toting the 5
I rep Willy's and Jers, I don't need to be on Ocean Drive
See the white tee wit my cig lit
I'm Larry Brown, New York is fucked up so they signed me to fix shit
When beef come I'm never tryna find me a biscuit
Late night I'm never tryna find me a quick trick
Call me I'll tell you how stupid a bitch get
I know they every move, see me on that kid shit
They wanna bring harm to you
Front like they really got a bond with you
Like 'member I went to the prom with you (nah!)
Fuck dude got not choice but to bong at you
Mans ain't gorilla, so better have King Kong with you
He's bitch see the lypo on him
Caravan might ride slow on him, mu'fucker
I might let this lil red light glow on him
Hope he walk round wit Geico on him, mu'fucker
Look, pardon you fags, Yea I heard part of your raps
It's all wack, how you start to get gassed
And this rap shit is like reality TV
It's totally different from what it's marketed as
Know the game's fucked up, no I can't call it quits
Can't knock me down, and I won't fall and trip
I gotta just milk this shit for all it gives
No chain on but 10 mortgages
So naw fam, don't wanna talk or just chit-chat
Fell down liftin the pound just from the kick back
Dudes got a problem wit me, just a snitch that
Ask anybody, I'm the wrong one to get at
Get that?
She so stupid, I'mma get her talk
Some of that good phone sex shit we be doin
Aight, take me from the mu'fuckin tippity",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-world-takeover-lyrics
Where Did It Go Wrong?,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Yo, niggas ain't lookin' for me like they say they are
But on some real shit, I pray they are
Cause niggas keep runnin' 'round acting like the AK far
I keep it nearby in case they start
Might catch 'em on a 'Friday'
Chill! they like Day-Day to the God
Think they already know it and it break they heart
With all the hate that he seem to get
Things jus ain't been the same since the A Team split
Got some hood niggas thinking they straight mutants
More like good niggas; straight A students
Dog it's no games, no intermission
Tell him I just seen him die and the premonition in him, listen
Can't eat dinner missing in the kitchen
Could smell but can't taste
I'm three laps ahead
You a snail in the race
Pale in the face
Niggas is lightwork on a scale with no weight
Wait, can't stand these clowns
Gave 'em everything they got so to me they just a hand-me-down
My dude, look around before you think about sparking
You're way outnumbered; go ahead and be a Spartan
It's stones getting thrown in here
Fuck these strip club hoes (nigga) I'll get Pacman Jones in here
I swear, it's getting harder to live with the anger
And home ain't home when you live with a stranger
Thought I knew you like the back of my hand
Fast forward three years and I got smacked with the back of her hand
Caught with my ass out without sagging my pants
Allow yaself to get caught like that with that man
Find out your wife that you sleeping with
Play herself start creeping with
One of your dudes
You confused you don't know who to get even with
Maybe you ain't the same broad that I was even with
When you cheating with dude I see and shit
Nigga I'm fly with, work with, we speak and shit
You the broad that would ride for me
Look me in the eyes transformed in to Shaggy
Bitch, how you gone lie to me?
Fell for the allure that's my bad you broke in something so
Secure
I'm now scarred, see, you make it type hard
For me to see the next broad
And not think that she ain't jus another hoe or slore
But thank you, see relationships in a different view, son
To get over the old girl gotta get a new one
Half of me still witchu and I don't care ya'll
Other half with her, I'm stuck, so I compare ya'll
Me and her's now, me and you got memories
Me and you got love, me and her got chemistry
She's like a friend to me, you like the enemy
Or maybe she's there just to cover that resentment B
Or maybe she ain't as fake as you and won't take me through
That same phase as you
Or, maybe it's simple
She seen all that pain I was in
And won't make the same mistake as you
I mean, (I mean) I never had an issue with trust
Never knew you had an issue with lust
We can get through anything in this world if the issue's discussed
Was it a whole separate issue or an issue with us?
But it gets bigger, you doubting you, you like, shit nigga!
Was his money longer or was his dick bigger?
You getting sick nigga
When you alone, and just you and your imagination, you paint a sick picture, (I'm witcha)",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-where-did-it-go-wrong-lyrics

Don't blame me, blame the syrup and the sprite
It's the new shit that they'll find me on
Maricon
Best rapper in the world but need help leaving no doubt
Now that Gwen Stefani's gone
Everybody's a Hannibal
Swallowing they eyes watching what they say
What y'all can do is pray
Before i got reformed nigga Glock went on the waste
Cross-dressing nothing but my mothers stocking on my face
Ain't the one u wanna try so fast
Talk crazy but walk the walk
Left a trail down a psychopath
Disturbing the peace
Swearing the v
Everyone word in my speech to heavy to bear
Become a burden on the beat
Look, I'm dealing with passive aggressive nasty women
That take me form humble beginnings to a happy ending
If it ain't about a buck then it's the wrong thought
You balling on a caps space you in the wrong sport
Attack me cause I say shit
That's they way of curbing that they had me as a favorite
They learning from Larry David
Chrome trigger u blown off the liquor
Prolly a tombstone will come quicker
Patron ain't your nigga
None of you dudes ain't soldiers
Ed helms when you lose your dog blame the hang over
Flame thrower
Get me when the label can't control ya
Can't say the chain smoker
Inside a propane holder
Currency is the plan to bury me where I stand
Fuck a record label I appear courtesy of my fans
And they can try to hurt me but they can't
I refuse to ball my fist while the heartbeat of Jersey's in my hand
So, I tell dude like I tell my nympho chicks
Keep it up and you bound to get fucked
Sounding real tough
Every line he move weight like he's a monster
I'm looking at his keys like Mashonda
Round up the troops
To tell him how he both in the booth
You don't sound like the truth
Wanna be on top of the world
Till he found in roof
Told dudes the old dudes
I'll be the poison on their fountain of youth
Nigga, I create it, you mock it
We know the shits belated when you jock it
Holding shit hostage
Penning that garbage
Before I pull the plug on em sending in hospice
Foreign to you American me
Got it locked its foreign, to you skeleton key
You taken em home
I give em the Sheridan key
You saving the birds Denzel
Pelican Brief
And I ain't tryna but what you selling to me
Done babying grown men
I'm done helping them eat
But they say u only rap about joe
Give it a rest
Grow a set
Dog i spit about what i know best
I got skin made of kevlar
Tough as steel say fuck the skill
And i far along blaze the house Russell built
Bring it on
Sing a long
Ring tone
Blank row
I come with a label that say don't try if seen at home
Just smart, figure i be less dark
Tell a model bitch lets part
Over a stretch mark
But being truthful's too brutal to do
So i lie like a bad teacher
Keep going till your pupils confused
Tired of hearing how you bust your hammer
Though this wouldn't be my public answer
Twice as nice as y'all
Though the fans love you grammar
They act like my bitches
Guess when it comes to me they double the standard
Fuck boy I ain't them other dudes
Pick whatever gun
Son found a problem that he can't trouble shoot
Notice I
So its like
Old school-esque poet like
Prototype
Since these niggas can't flow it right
Fans ain't falling for the madness either
You milking the game its from a bad breast feeder
Make you a believer
Doubt what i said

Dave, Mike, I see you
Joe Budden, Mood Muzik 3
Let's go

Now look, I'm in that 550 feelin like Chuck Liddell
Aside from Rampage Jackson it's ""fuck the world""
My lean came so mean, +So Fresh and So Clean+
Like a Sunday morning listenin to Joel Osteen
Like my beat down low, I'm rimmed up with the seat back
Boo with the sweet back, I definitely need that
Even if her body make a nigga want eat that
Bitch you don't +Make+ a nigga +Better+, better see Fab
I know a bird named Amy, love to tea bag
Set you up right for some loosies and a weed bag
Alcoholic, cute face but her weave bad
And she went to the Winehouse straight from the +Rehab+
The recap rappers and they G stacks
Fixated on imaginary ice like freeze tag
I speed past, ease past with my G swag
I'm at a level most niggas couldn't see past

On my grind, chasin dollars (chasin dollars)
In the fall or the summer (fall or the summer)
Streets are pullin me under (pullin me under)
And I ain't gettin no younger

Shout out to Paree
Jill, Grimstyles
Can't forget Jay, what up?

Whoa, whoa, some say ""sky's the limit"", still I'm tryin to reach higher
So on my deathbed, I'm figurin how to be fly
I'm talkin above heaven (but)
But talkin about death is me beatin a dead horse and a nigga love ""Slevin""
I'm a '80's baby with a '60's mind state, Yankee fitted backwards
Lookin at whippersnappers
Livin young and reckless, never mind who the best is (might as well)
They need to get rid of their style, put it on Craigslist (nigga)
Cause you ain't crazy, stop it
Even if you was wild like Randy Moss, start feelin Patriotic
How I'm gon' lose with Tom Brady in the pocket?
Beggin dude to come back like the Yankees did ""The Rocket""
And just like Clemens did
Reappear to get the most wins it in, damn dickheads is so sensitive
Pussies get hemorrhages, find a way to benefit
Even when it seem the whole World is against the kid


Whoa, I mean, the burner's in the air (is that what you want?)
Like J. Holiday I'll put you permanently there
It's +Bedtime+ niggas, weapon of mine niggas, Wesson or nine niggas
""Minority Report"", I'm ahead of your mind niggas
You wanted to beef, you got twenty with you, I got a hundred with me
Now this is somethin to see (oh)
Boogieman your whole squad, put you under some sheets
In that Dodge Richard Reid had under the sheet
On some Jetsons shit but if the shook type approach me
I'll fill 'em with metal 'til he look like Rosey
Niggas ain't off the hook like Joey
My feet is up cozy, at the end of my bed
Get on my Puff Daddy +All About The Benjamins+ shit
And turn my back on Danja/danger like Timbaland did (ya heard?)
Hoodie over my head, the snub showin
Fuck what the World's come to, where the fuck's it goin?

I'm feelin' fine, you see it
I know some folks probably messed up my kindness for weakness
Can't bring me down
Though I heard a few tracks
I'm a hundred percent healthy
Got my vertical back
You know the jump shot is wicked
And my defence is seeming so tight
Man, everything's just seeming so bright
I got my game face on
Ready to give back, pronto
Give back to the fans
Get back to Toronto
Going back to the basics
This'll be fun for me
No chase to the game

That's a dumb move like goin' to Brooklyn screaming F.B.I
Or going to Brooklyn playing F.B.I
Tryna shake the scene or tryna be Jayreen, nigga
And I ain't got beef with one gang
Just one clown dude who just got rid of his tongue ring
Put us in a room alone, give us room alone
He knows better, he'd never step in a room alone
When it's all done I'd be leaving the room alone

I'm not a killer, I leave that for my mans
Not a gorilla, leave that one for

Through the storm, through the light, (This is called The Growth)
When the storm went through my eyes
I been through it all and stuck in through and through
(We gonna do it like whoa whoa whoa whoa)

Look I want y'all to understand I never did nothing to hurt nobody
I might have shot at a couple a niggas never murked nobody
Kind hearted, everybody ain't as good see
I'm one of them niggas who try to help out everybody in the hood (Chea!)
Always stayed to myself, I ain't start wit niggas
A class clown dude, I ain't never bothered niggas
I did minor B&E's, I did minor hustlin
Minor stickups, as a minor, it was minor, it was nothin (nah)
Wasn't caked up, every week buying new sneakers
Nah I never been shot, don't aspire to either (not really)
Never had a ill car with the real thin tires
That all the popular girls that's real thin would admire (ohh)
Yea I always stayed real, some probably a stunt
I guess I never had somethin somebody'll want
Nah I never fronted hard as shit
And never had a nigga ride right on the side of my car and click!
Don't know dude, ain't seen him from the past or nothing (Let's Go!)
Wasn't tryna rob me, cuz he ain't ask for nothing
Had other people in the car that I was friends wit see
And he pointed at them first so was it meant for me, but stilll (What?)
God's got a major plan, and I don't need no other sign, God made it jam
So fam I ain't got beef with 50 nah I got beef wit Josh,(Yea!)
And I won't sleep till that beef is squashed (Fucker!)
Gotta get em, yea yea, I was thinkin that too
But here's my Timbs nigga, tell me what you think I should do
(What would you do if you me?)
Gun on me, all day I don't blink and I'm drew
Hand on it through the pocket, I dont think that that's cute, I Don't!
I never did that nah remember earlier I said I never lived that
But, gotta live that, I know where you live at
Sit back relax, gotta get at partner, this is get back Joshua!

How could a real nigga really wanna off with my wig
I give it back, I visit high schools, I talk to the kids, (Yooooo)
I do cleanup day in the hood
You gotta pay, so everyday, now is cleanup day in the hood, (Yea)
How could a nigga want my son growing up without a father
Maybe that you can answer me Joshua?
Josh is still some in the mag and I like sayin your name
It feels good knowing who was up under that mask (Fucker!)
So they say I ain't got sense, I'm giving nod to my henchmen
Like how I'm tryin to have revenge on divine intervention
Doing the hood a favor, make em lay face down
I'm gettin the jokers out the game y'all we playin Ace down!
I'm not sayin this thoughts is right
But all my life, I've been taught to fight
No recreation, I just bought a kite
Slippin, as if it was all good I was lamping
I was trippin, must have mistaken the hood for the Hamptons (Chea!)
Knowing the leaches is out
Whodini said it, at night the freaks is out
And they ain't leavin without
It's like a nigga need brakes
You left the keys in the Porsche
You in the hood like steak, like you ain't feed for the dogs
Like the wolves ain't hungry, won't get in yours
Can't hang out with pitbulls when you shit indoors
Then they can't wait to get in your bank
You can't be the only one above water when there's fish in the tank
I understand why niggas leave ain't they don't come back
It's either that or they family will grieve and they won't come back
Eulogy said and the caskets drop
You blew that young dude
I mean you literally had your shot (nigga!)
Niggas envy what they see
Out of sight, out of mind
So I'mma go on get ghost for a minute
You got a problem in your hood I can help you around it
Cause I've done been through it all I'm here to tell you about it

"Money, Power, Respect Freestyle",UnKnown,UnKnown,"They call me F-A-Beezy, sometimes Stizzo
The wrist on freezy, neck on glizzo
The coupe move easy at two-double-izzo
Truck look cheezy 
And it's jacked up like it sit on stilettos
Can't you see the glit' on the pebbles that sit on the bezel
None of you little scraps couldn't get on my level
Take more than a hot song to try to sit on the devil
Got respect when I killed ""Money, Power"" the first time
When they tried to knock down the towers the first time
And the only reason I'm talking 'bout it
Is so you know the real talk of New York's about it
I'm with a bitch, with a tight ass that shakes
Her suck game will one gulp: White Castle shakes
Got the home right past the lake
When I came home they stop us, this time might blast the jake
I'm the nigga on the couches in clubs
And I stand out from the rest of the slouchers and scrubs
Bottles and bottles with a train of pretty hoes
That look like they could be the mains in videos
We in the caps with the Yankee logos
Blowing on the stanky dro dro, the pinky snow-globe
And you know the link be so ""oh""
Niggas look fast but the blinks be slow-mo
I could spot a kinky ho though
All hood bitch, she just tryna make you think she SoHo
Plus I know the game like the back of my hand
When I'm lazy, you can catch me in the back of sedans
When I'm gone, you can bet I'm coming back with a tan
With the Mickey D signs on the back of my pants
And I act like the man, 'cause this my time
Plus the hood say they miss my dimes, it's young money

All you see me with is Coogi, dogs and long chains
Fucking with some bougie broads with long brain
Plus now I'm usually calm, the storm came
But still keep a toolie on like John Wayne
Catch me in the kitchen, dope bricks on the fire
Them niggas that be spittin, those pricks is some liars
Never been pitchin, sold clips to them buyers
Me? I hang on the block like broke kicks on the wire
The kid is so nasty with it
Copped a new Benz and only paid half to get it
I'm a gorilla that had to get classy with it
Your dumb bird gave me head because Fab was with us
Could care less who your bitch be feeling
I'm in a loft with nice floors and crispy ceiling
As long as I get it off and get these millions
I retire to smoke weed like Ricky Williams

Now your cake is gone, niggas wanna hate the Storm
Cause they know my team reign surpreme, and I'm Jason Bourne
Catch a case Im gone, just another face to mourn
Stay down 'fore the tre-pound leave your face deformed
Listen pal, you ain't really pitching vials
Just wanna rap back and forth like 'Kiss and Styles
Every other day, you could say I be switching dials
Fourty-grand, fifty-thou, and I got the fifty-cal
It's Hitchcock, Hannibal of rap
You ain't gotta see a show to see an animal attack
Im an animal a warrior in fact
With tre snubs, repping A-dub in the corner with gats
And Im in a fast car, with a crash bar
Built in the dash part sorta like Nascar
Outlast yall because I treat the track like a cell phone
I burn it down to the last bar

You're welcome
You ain't gotta thank me for what i did to the mixtapes
Make sure the labels get my shit straight
You ain't gotta pat me on the back (back!)
Just pack me in that 'Bach ('Bach!)
With a dime, fine wine and some blinds in the back
Curtains is too extra
Though the silk shirt's fucking with my chest hairs
I'm in love with the texture
The gorgeous one has spoken, clear stones in his hair
Pink in his eyes like Jesus has awoken
It's all in the belt buckle, a mansion in that
And if you call shorty, buckle, just imagine the neck
And the trousers Mugler, the shoes is Maury
These rap niggas startin to bore me
Most MCs square, so the button-up's MC squared
I'm insulted when they offer me ears
The babes want me in 
And you know the boys want me in states
I'm retiring pyrex - call me Seymour Cake!

Now niggas say they in the hood like Mister Softee
They in the hood getting treated like Mister Softie
“I clap the four-fifth”, if you believe that
Then you believe Rick James died of natural causes
I'm twisting up trees-chronic to switching up ebonics
Started in the fifth grade, switching up etonics
Know a few dudes that'll spit at your dome
So go see 'em if you really want invisible stones
Try and get at me to hit him
Just type forty acres and a mule in your navi system
My hood—they kidnapping your kids
See, we try and Tom Cruise and Jamie what collateral is
Whack dudes in the game is a problem
But they like Maurice Malone jeans, their name will stay on the bottom
Murdering that? Nah, heard him, he's sub-par
Coyote Ugly
 rappers, keep working at your bars

Cain got the heart of a soldier, mind of a general
Strategy is important, timing is critical
We wear tracks out, lyrically I'm a beast
From Brooklyn's backbone, epitome of the streets
Only the strong survive, if you physically weak
You get gunbutted, stabbed, shot, and critically beat
'Cause listen, ain't no shook hands in Brooklyn
Presidential with the matching bullet bracelet, it's a good look, man
Call me whatever, I hustle and I rap a little
You see the color stones chain look like a pack of Skittles
I give 'em anthrax, every bar is that official
I know I'm a gangster, I ain't got to pack a pistol
I don't rap in riddles, I give it to a nigga
Straight, no chaser, I'm like Hen' on the rocks
If it ain't the fifth, it's probably the Glock
I'm the nigga Clue and Duro call when they need the bodies to drop
If it ain't the chain, it's probably the watch
When I ride if it ain't the truck or sedan, it's probably the drop
Play the block, I don't party a lot
I'm the one who sent the goon with the snub to get the jewels from the club
I could never blow all my dough
When I get at least ten people robbed at all my shows
And all I know: money, clothes, birds, and cars
Running from Po's, champagne, furs, and R's
Quite sure you must've heard of the God
If not I'm Cain, Triangle Offense, I'm a third of the squad
I'm the first line of the defense, the star point guard
Is back starting, y'all be used to riding the bench
 fuck that ""no women, no kids"" shit
When the shotty blows, everybody goes, business is business
But dig this, fuck a guilty conscience
I'll put a slug in you, really give you something to live with
Fuck street fighting, I pull a hammer in a split second
The kid breathe fire, and speak lightning
These niggas ain't writing
All they did was analyze my flow, and use my style so their liking, nigga

Now the year's new, I laid my game flat
I want my spot back, take two, motherfucker",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-money-power-respect-freestyle-lyrics
Check Me Out,Halfway House,2008.0,"Check me out right here
Nahmean? Old school
Old school niggas used to be like
What they used to be like? ""Check me out now""
What other ad-libs these old niggas used to say?
Hahaha, I don't know but fuck it
Look

Now let me ask you a question
Who are you? Where you from? What you reppin'?
Is every bar about a burner or a weapon?
And now he all gassed up by his brethren (what?)
Some tell me that my music is depressin' (but a)
But, best rapper in the world, I was destined
Jump Off! Must be the exception (I mean a)
Am I the only one that's progressin' in a recession? (listen)
They tell me trickin' ain't trickin' if you got it
I never heard more false words spoken
So, if I tell you I'ma leave your wrist frozen
I was either lyin' to you or just jokin'
You could be in a wet T-shirt soakin'
You could, tell me how your shit get like the ocean (you could)
You could, jerk me off with a bottle of lotion
While ya legs open and have trouble gettin' a token
I grew up a little (see), see I'm much more mature
My rapport is one you can adore (ask around)
That wasn't always the case, so that's for starter
I'm enjoyin' the hood, the one after father
I used to invest in heroin
With money in Maryland, not Merrill Lynch
Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs
And now I'm holdin' stacks (as I), as I stroll in Saks
Sing it!

Uh, check me out now
Ya mean?
Nigga all grown up
How ill is this shit?
Now look, look

When I was younger I used to get ass for sport
Now I'm less about her sex, I'm more into her thoughts (yeah aight)
Nah, I ain't mean to cross that yet, I regress
I'm more into her thoughts on sex
And the property, fuck what's across my neck
Be clear, I'm more into her career than her hair
Her mind state, nothin is insurmountable (look here)
I'm worried about her account (I mean), is she accountable?
Real man shit, I'm no longer outlandish
The roof don't drop (but) but it's panoramic
And I know haters can't stand it (so!)
So I do it on purpose, still on my Jerz shit (oh!)
We don't fall flat and we never cave in
I lead pressure right to my doormat
All that adversity never worried me
If anything it feeds me, it'll nourish me (motivation)
I try to keep it a hundred, non-fiction
Lane switchin's in my True Religion with the double stitchin'
No fitted, T, Kid Robot
These rap niggas is ass and I don't dig Botox
Into enterin' clubs, dodgin' photogs
So they can talk shit about me for a whole blog
Go hard, no prob, that's the plan
I might laugh and joke son, but I'm a grown ass man, ya heard?

Uh, check me out now
Yeah, Joey!
Tahaha, I swear to God
If this roof came down
This shit be down right now, snowin'
And I'd have my, my motherfuckin', my shades on and shit
My hand out the window, smokin'
A blunt, next to the cops too
Fuck off coppers!

My Life,Mood Muzik Vol. 3.5 ,2007,"Hustling trying to get that dough
Another day, it's another struggle
This is my life
(My life, my life, my life, my life!)

You can take a kid out the slums, but never vice versa
Across the street from dope, two lights from murder
Ain't too many ways for me and pies to merger
Now that mickey d's just slinging fries & burgers
Had dreams of nice clothes, rolling in cars
I had never seen working at that golden arch
You see, I couldn't dribble much, jumpshot wasn't water
I started with weed, then flooded blocks with water
My pops not around, moms saying I'm hell bent
Hell sent, just tried to help with the rent
I'm paying bills at 16, you Gotta' love it
Offered mom the bread, she ain't wanna touch it
Said If I can't follow the rules, I gotta move
Find a new hangout, then ""Juice"" came out
Then tools came out, and I was feeling like Bishop
Might as well go all out, you got one life so live it

Hustling trying to get that dough
Another day, It's another struggle
This is my life
(My life, my life, my life, my life!)
So what if my pants sag low?
Just sit back and inhale that smoke
This is my life
(My life, my life, my life, my life!)

Look, It's not an album
Dropouts get drunk, smoke dust
Till you start feeling like you a falcon
Contemplating jumping while you standing on the balco-ny
Mix a little weed and this'll be the outcome
More haze I puff made me feel like I was brave enough to Bust
And ten grades was enough
Tried to scare me straight, took my kicks and threw 'em
Transparent lifers, I seen right through 'em
They couldn't get to 'em, my money still flowing in
Girls is watching, they now noticing
Like here we go again, oh! Po-Po again
On they walkie talkies saying ""We got Joe again""
Move at my own process, cool with every C.O
Just skipped getting processed, thats what I call progress
Digest us being America's Nightmare
Young, black and trying to get rich, we ain't quite there


I love Hip Hop culture, helps me get through my fans
We buy clothes too big, it made us feel little for years
Yeah, they tried to underhand us, we speak in our own slang
So only our niggas can understand us
And nah, I ain't pulling my pants up
Don't cross the street when you see me, nigga, man up
We trying to do everything they said we couldn't
Wear my hat to the side cause society say I shouldn't
I'm far from ashamed, I remember being yay' high watching ""Purple Rain""
The club owner sayin' ""They ain't understanding ya' music, things change""
How you tell Prince he wouldn't last in the game?
And we feeling the same, thats sort of like what they told us
Cause shits on our shoulders
We keep chipping at it as we get older
The temps dropping and shits getting colder
Throw my hood and boots on, going out like a soldier",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-my-life-lyrics
Stand Up Nucca,Joe Budden,2003.0,"-talking
Uh-huh
I just want everybody to kinda be clear
Of what's takin place right now
It's not an introduction, it's more like a beginning
It's like the calm before the storm
I guess you can sorta call it, the rebirth
Or the birth period... it's the growth
For all my real niggas... real people in general
It's never one-dimensional, it goes out to everybody
If you can though... just kinda take some time out
Relate to it

For all my mans that died, with grams at they side
Plans just to ride, gun jammed when he tried
Ballers who never made it out the hood
Cats who owed, but never made it out the hood
If they offered you pleas and you went to court with it
My dawgs doin time cause you got caught with it
Or if you need cheddar, blast heat whenever
And run from the cops cause you know the streets better
Dope niggas who rich cause they know connects
Or dope niggas who spit but got no connects
If you pitch to pay rent, but get no business
Life in the state pen but get no visits
Fend for yourself cause you ain't got no boys
Ride or die, really you ain't got no choice
If your alibi's straight when you're wanted on the stand
Soldiers that take they football numbers like a man
Hustle O-Z cause your product rich there
Hood know you snitch but you gotta live there
You held your man shot, you don't know where it hit him
And you tryin to buy guns, you don't know where to get 'em
If you strapped in the streets with your palms all black
Young G's that gotta see they moms on crack
Pop can't be found, hand me down
When you the oldest out of five, hold the family down
If you caught a body and your wiz hid you out
If you slept in the park when moms kicked you out
Or if you gonna die, you gon' leave with a slug
Idolized your big bro, but he was a thug
If you squeeze your leather first cause it never hurt
Street cats that never work cause it never worked
Or if you got your shit snatched, gripped, clipped the mack
Too small for the kickback, but gotta get your shit back
Killed niggas playin, but you was only boxin
Accept twenty flat as your only option
Calm in the jungle in between the system
If you high on parole and gotta clean your system
If you told 'em to stop, cause soon you'll lose it
Pull up your pants leg, bullet wounds to prove it
Or if you grabbed the liquor, swallow it hard
If they drive-by on you but you follow the car
Full clip cause your foes is lurkin; or the D's at your door
With a picture, ""Do you know this person?""
If you dead broke, but forced into extortin
Cause your girl pregnant and she don't want a abortion
Got charged before, strap a gun anyway
Took the state's lawyer, but you won anyway
Stand up cats beat the odds by far
Real recognize real, R.R.R
Don't mistake a amped up nucca.. for what?
For a stand up nucca.. I won't
If you a stand up nucca.. then what?
Then stand up nucca.. R.. R.. R
Basically, that's about it
Hope you people get a better understanding
And roll with me... geah!

Whole Monie Ave, I see you

Yo, my struggle's a little different
Y'all niggas was selling, I was sniffin
Sike, rewind it, I'm just kiddin (OH!)
I was hangin with old heads, tryna put my bid in
Same safe you was stackin in, I was tryna get in
Y'all was fuckin with pigeons (naw)
I was on Malcolm X, lookin for a jar for my cig to get dipped in (OH!)
Was still spittin, before the video vixens
Around the time Ewing had got dunked on by Pippen
Niggas was still pitchin
I was stealin money from my moms anytime she left her purse in the kitchen (that was fucked up)
Guzzlin a fifth and
I was high as a fuck, OD'n on Visine, so my eyes wouldn't glisten (OH!)
Moms still bitchin
She thought I knew better, but I didn't
She tried to talk to 'em, wouldn't listen (listen, wouldn't listen)
It's almost like somethin inside of me kept itchin
I thought the streets loved me, naw who was I kiddin? (kiddin)
God lookin like the devil (oh)
Sendin me to the pawn shop anytime I found shit that looked like metal
I dropped outta school, naw not to be cool
I was sittin there bored, thought all y'all was fools
Fuck I wanna read up on ""Romeo & Juliet""
Way back, I ain't even have my first toolie yet
Angie ain't even make that knife go through me yet (talk to 'em)
Matter fact, I ain't even smoke my first woolie yet
Tried to have it wrapped, but things wasn't a doobie yet
What was comin for me, but naw it ain't subdue me yet

Young niggas, know I used to be a young nigga
I used to pop off to prove I ain't the one nigga
B and E's, stick ups and dirty guns niggas
This before I finally had my little young nigga
Young niggas, God keep me from these young niggas
Not the smart ones Lord, just the dumb niggas
Might have me thinkin I'm still one of them niggas
Shit changed from when I used to be a young nigga


Yo, aiyyo
My first time locked up, I was a child
Met up with mad niggas I ain't seen in a while (yeah)
And it wasn't bad bein locked in with them (but)
But couldn't fathom lockin in at 10
Like fuck readin a book, sat on my bunk, mad time to get my thoughts straight
One month, one shower, still without a court date
Just bags of nicotine, rollin paper
Did pull ups, push ups, how the fuck'd I get here?
War stories, you hear a lot of shit here
Great place to visit, but naw don't wanna live here (live here ...)
Naw gotta get my mind in a new place
Grimy ass niggas stealin my socks and toothpaste
Can't ever remember feelin such neglect
But snakes get snaked (dog), what the fuck'd I expect? (expect)
I thought if anything I had earned niggas respect
But niggas hung up soon as they heard ""Collect""
Had my mag with the tits out
O.G.s said to me the streets don't love you, they'll be there when you get out
Bunch of the same people, still in the same space
A few of 'em'll die, a few will take your place
I prayed to God that I never catch another case
Cause CO's just treat us like we rats in a maze
You wonder why Joey always hype and smilin (why?)
I was this close to Rikers Island
Was bein on Rikers, wilin (wilin)
I've been through way worse shit than havin a few gripes bout my album (c'mon)

Had to prove it to the crowd
Had to Have the last word that Night
You Know what everything's about
You had to be a big Shot, Didn't Ya'?
You had to be a big Shot, Didn't Ya'?

Yeah Yeah, It's Ya' Boy Boy, listen to 'em
I think maybe the steroids is finally gettin' to him
Or maybe it's people believing all the hard raps
Or maybe it's the tank top with the bra straps
Maybe he's really believing he's a heathen
Like dude he stole his name from
Dude ain't the same none
Nothing's hardbody about him, He's like puddin'
So can't we all beat off all his white Goodmen
Now I can and just wait till his team dissolve
Or I can go and get you picked, no screens involved
I get you offed for a clip, no fiends involved
Or we can take it one further, get Queens invovled
Where they know he never went to Jail, never over a banger
He went to bootcamp, not in pop with the gansgtas
Sorta' like Yayo who stayed in P.C
And you can ask anybody up in MDC
But I guess he's a tough guy now that he's free
But doing that kind of jail time is easy
But it's not beneath me, really I gives a fuck
I could put the whole Unit on the next Nip & Tuck (But!)
He keep his dudes in check, I keep it real with him
Punched Banks in the face and he still with 'em
Don't worry 'bout me putting clips in the forty
To pistol whip Lloyd when 50'll do it for me

You had to be a big Shot, Didn't Ya'?
Had to open up Ya' Mouth
You had to be a big Shot, Didn't Ya'?
Had to prove it to the crowd
Had to Have the last word that Night
You Know what everything's about
You had to be a big Shot, Didn't Ya'?
You had to be a big Shot, Didn't Ya'?

Far as the kid Game, he lame to say the least
Mad he from the West, so he diverted to the East
All he talk about, him and his man that'll blast pounds
But when you see him, he just dancing in the background
I tore Game apart
Thought by now the asshole would have a change of heart
Especially since I got the tape of this GANGSTA on ""Change of Heart""
Teary eyed cause his shorty had a change of heart
But I smell something fishy, there's a con in the air
Slacks, his tongue pierced, streaks blonde in his hair
Who's he playing with? Keep saying shit
And ya' body will take the same tour Reagan's did
Still trying to get a buzz, embarrassed, the kid's hurtin'
Reachin', he's losin' his head, he's Nick Bergman
And far as Banks & Buck, I'm done discussing 'em (Why?)
I only beef with niggas who own publishing
Curtis you a bum, and you almost done
Same artist you was dissing exactly's what become
Saw him at Summer Jam, and all he did was stare
Walked on stage, all you heard was chairs/ cheers (they threw the chairs at him)
Don't be seen no more, he's a queen no more
And he can't even step foot in Queens no more
Selling his soul, Banks, hope you're proud of your father

Okay, the time has finally come, beautiful people
Yeah, I've been singing this tune for entirely too long now
For like, 8 or 9 years, something like that
But I'm here, only to present to you your album
Featuring myself, Joe Budden, hi haters

The time is finally near, it's getting closer I'm finally scared
Scratch that, the album's out y'all, it's finally here
I repeat myself for the haters, y'all, I'm finally here
Every street corner, jail cell, finally cheer
Cause it was y'all that voted me, y'all that noticed me
It was y'all that said I should've been signed to Def Poetry
It was y'all that said yes, y'all can floetry
Mama raised me proper, the streets just molded me
The streets coded me, made me a better pedigree
Now things are complicated like Avril Lavigne said it be
But I took some time out to get my shit straight
And present to you, jump off 70 minute mixtape
This here's for real, this here's the official
This year it's not a ""Best Of,"" this is the best of
How can I say this?
It's sorta like - Hov', 'Pac, B.I.G. blended with Bill Withers and Miles Davis
Let's add Al Green, folks, I miscalculated
Now it's Ludacris time, ""Move - get out my way bitch!""
A rapper's rapper, the kid can do this
To you ignorant motherfuckers, don't misconstrue this
Everything reversed now, I live in the matrix
So how can I stay anonymous, when it's my job to be famous?
A lot of y'all can't interpret when I'm speaking that language
But some better understand to the rest it's better you can't
Now, when you speak of the elite, I feel honored if mentioned
Because the goal is on top, never honorable mention
If Joe's purpose is due, here it is, it's no further anew
Enough said with no further ado",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-intro-joe-budden-lyrics

Aww yeah (Uhh, y'know)

You wanna get right, boo, headlights, blue
Don't no other mami give me head like you
I get you in the club, sit right in the Rover
Now you ain't gotta pretend like you like the promoter
We could lamp in the 5 with my hand on yo' thigh
You goin to sleep thinkin that this can't be life
Don't mistake my talkin modest
Still put you in the wi-ld bedroom with the walk-in closet
Bay, riverboats, if you wanna see water
Full length minks, get rid of that three-quarter
Ex-man never had you feelin that fly
Flat screens in the room with the ceiling that high
When them other cats call you, you can turn your phone off
New school your neck, take that herringbone off
Stretch 'Vee playin Manhattan
System old school, play 'em and had 'em
We makin it happen, oh yeah

Turn this off for a minute
We can do bigger things if you widdit
We can be me and you, I know you feel it
You can say, ""La la-la la, la la la la""
All you want, you can get it
You can have all my time, let's spend it
The way you do your thing, I can't forget it
Got me screamin, ""Ma ma-ma ma, ma ma ma ma""

Look, I need a wife too, feed her ice, blue
Got birds on the side, I don't treat 'em like you
I don't let 'em play with the wheel and when the check come
They already know they gotta pay for they meals
Say I'm, comin at you with lines, think they lies
Just because I don't match your compatible sign
I'mma let the world see, other boos can't relate
Let you walk in front, make the other dudes hate
When I put it on you, you throw it right back (ha ha)
Who else you know gon' poke it like that?
And ma I'm gon' show you like that, you be hollerin
""La la-la la, la la la la"" - oh yeah, look
Private party, it's just me, you
And the new India.Arie, you won't be sorry
Scoop it, we can do the all from Harley(?)
Y'all ask me hardly nah, I'm up to par


Breguet my miss, no less for my miss
And I never let a clown disrespect my miss
I need dat in my life, a G might cry
But you the only one that ever get to see that side
Look, my lady fresh, we ain't gotta rush
We can take baby steps, that may be the best
Hate to repeat myself, I know I already told you
But mom's sayin what's good I'm tryin to know you
If you been for lookin for the right one, well here he is
Ready to take things a little mo' serious
Ain't nervous no more, you heard it all before
Are you a Fifth Ave miss, but you workin that velour?
Stop, I'm tired of trickin, I'm tired of pigeons
Need a house with acres to put my wife and kids in
Chefs are good when they gettin right in the kitchen
Babygirl that's the life we'd be livin, overstand somethin

Baby let me be with you more, hold you more
Let me get the chance, I can show you more
Let me get to know you more, I'll be screamin out
""La la-la la, la la la la""
If I could, wife you out, ride this out
You're the only one I wouldn't ride without
I could show you what this life's about
I be screamin out, ""Ma ma-ma ma, ma ma ma ma""

This is the type of shit right here, listen
You gotta go to the car wash on this one
Hehe, you can't ride around dirty and dusty and shit
If it just went yesterday, when you wake up
Take it to the car wash
Don't just get the exterior joint neither
We need the-the-the works, the thirty dollar joint
And we need to get the little tree to put up in the rearview

Through The Wire,Mood Muzik: The Worst of Joe Budden,2003,"Now if it goes to the wire
I will never fall, I got the soul of a fighter
Walk barefoot over coal, over fire
Nobody's gonna love me like me, so I'm my sole provider
If it goes to the wire
I will never fall, I got the soul of a fighter
Walk barefoot over coal, over fire
Nobody's gonna love me like me, so I'm my sole provider

Nobody thought I'd ever be dope with the pen
Whole first album was real, all wrote from within
Got a little bit of fame, I'm in the five, top off
 lokin' again, nah, I ain't smokin' again
Maybe I was too advanced, or 'cause the masses
Didn't go through it firsthand maybe they couldn't understand
The trials of a kid who never graduated
Maybe they'd rather hear some bullshit that's fabricated
Like my rims keep spinnin' on the V on the ave
Fuck me gettin' shot at, or me gettin' stabbed
Fuck gettin' so high to the point that I was gettin' so high
Off of that high that I almost died
Fuck everything I've seen in the precinct that's indecent
Or the coppers tryna keep me in there for no reason
Fuck being homeless, rib cage showin'
Last night I had beef but had to go there to eat
Fuck me growin' up and not gettin' to see Dad
Fuck therapy, detoxes and rehabs
Dudes in the hood being wild undercover
Or me beefin' with my child's mother
Or fuck Joe Budden the Third, chill
'Cause if you fuck with Joe Budden the Third then, nigga, that's my word
Fuck the jealousy, deceit
Fuck the strong-arm and B&E's,  much older than twenty-three
Fuck what I'm rappin', fuck this and the pad
And nigga fuck me missin' my dad
Maybe if I rap 'bout buyin' the bar out, or all the jewellery that I got
Then maybe y'all niggas'll listen to that
But listen, know now that this is my whole style
And I can't rap that other shit, I don't know how
All the hate shit on me and the fakeness I see
I write the real and you can't take that from me

If it goes to the wire
I will never fall, I got the soul of a fighter
Walk barefoot over coal, over fire
Nobody's gonna love me like me, so I'm my sole provider

I don't write so my label can be on top
Nigga, I write so the voices in my head just stop
Nigga, I write my life and it's way too real
This is Pay-per-view, not the Dave Chappelle
Joey hated by many and loved by few
One of the last real niggas left, what you wan' do?
Trouble with my voice, but even without a voice
Still for every hood in New Jersey I'm the choice
Used to break up in a house for a TV
Two years later, look Mouse on TV
My story nonetheless
And it's a story of success, nigga, it's the story of the best

Nobody Loves Me,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Look here..
See I grew up around the projects
Grew up around the Glocks yes
Taught to fend for myself whenever Pops left
A good kid turnin' into a hood prospect, why?

If so, it was after the bread risin' (Right)
After I put the hood on like Lil Red Ridin'
The gangsta that's glorifyin'
And strugglin' bubbled number for a stack
And that's a fact...until that?

(Oh!)
And if they did, I never felt it
Spent a couple nights in a box, I couldn't help it (Dawg, I couldn't help it)
When niggas on the tier ice grilled, I had to melt it
Dream was on the right track...somebody rebelled it
Was taught cash rules, but I ain't have a dollar for livin'
No window, no pot to piss in (So!)
So all my dudes in they cells that's locked in prison, is it cause..

(Nope!)
Til I pissed a few niggas off like Bill O'Reilly (Right)
Exposed the game's soft spot like Maury (Ha!)
Showed the hustlers how we
Turned an advance to a grand finale (Heh)

Look here
I was doin' pull ups and eatin' pancakes (And then?)
And then I pulled up in that pancake (Talk to 'em!)
Suicide doors, iced the band and the face
Yes Jerze...(Ok)

Til I proved my name was a factor (How?)
Summertime, played the crate
Bathin' 8ths and chains that'll change the chill factor (Schieeeet!)
Two toned toy to antagonize the children (Right)
It's still Roc For Life like they kicked me out the building

But I ain't goin' nowhere, at least no time soon
So get used to me, real niggas rep, that's how it used to be
F-Y-I, still got the deuce-deuce wit' me
Why?

(I know...so?)
That's why I got niggas robbed for their jewelry (Right)
Brought heaters to where my goons be (Right)
My divas in (?) (Right)
My groupies rockin' that Juicy (Whoo!)
40's on me but usually
The roofless coupe's on the corner like a hooptie
(Right, right)
Oh!
I know!

It's like I didn't feel the love
Until I put the 645 on dubs
And sueded out the guts
In the belly of the beast, you make it out with guts
In that title, homeboys is naked without the trust (Ya Heard!)

Rep-wise I'm celibate, ain't a soul fuckin' wit' 'em (Uh huh)
Emcees watch they mouths like Chris Tucker wit' 'em (Heh)
Up and comer's owe me, until I'm paid, you stuck wit' 'em

Real Life in Rap,Joe Budden,2003.0,"I hate y'all duuuuuuudes
That get real life and rap confuuuuuuused
Don't get it fucked up, and don't get shoooot
Tryin to be somethin you're nooooot
-- my niggas want war, whatchu think you good for?

Yeah you talk like them threats is real
A pine box, closed casket and mommy's black dress is real
I only spit what I live, and I play my part, feds know
You just talkin burners cause your A&R said so
Don't play the game like it's just a scrimmage
Don't think that what you hearrrin is just a image
How your songs though? You never spent a day in the bing
Niggas is movin they mouths but they ain't sayin a thing
Half y'all vets is heartless and rep regardless
Only time you seen a courtroom was pressin charges
How you baggin up white, but won't scrap in a fight
Sheeeeit, c'mon mayne, shit ain't addin up right
When shit's thick, whatchu gon' do with that pound
But real recognize real, you must be new in this town
All I'm hearin is another nigga's life over tracks
And you lames ain't willin to lose your life over rap


Tired of hearin 'bout you rap dudes comin with the guns
Never caught a body, had the smell comin from the trunk
(And umm) I'm tired of hearin 'bout your 4's bust
While I was cuffed on a up North bus
Y'all fucked on a tour bus
All them stories 'bout you gettin money with gangsters
(Guess what?) The shit is pretty funny to gangsters
I'm tired of hearin 'bout that gat in your boot
Cause when it's said and done
And you finished that rap in the booth, it's back to the truth
And your shit is glass thug (and you) never outside
Cause youse a in the lab thug (youse a) pen and pad thug
It sounds good, you ain't pushin work in the projects
But you spittin 'bout it when you work on your project
Clown answer back, y'all never seen the hammers flash
Just photo shoots when cameras flash
All I'm hearin is another nigga's life over tracks
And you lames ain't willin to lose your life over rap


In direct beef between rappers, they be all thugs
See each other in the street and dap, it's all love
War stories ain't yours about the pounds your man got
Only time you move bricks is when the SoundScan drop
You ain't never cooked NOTHIN by that kitchen sink
And the only time you been behind bars was fixin a drink
You actin a fool, got real life and rap confused
With them ten o'clock songs, you just rappin the news
But I ain't mad atcha flow, he tryin to stack his dough
But everybody's a thug until them ratchets show
The same dudes that rap about (they get) stuck for all the 1's
And if everybody's a killer, where the fuck is all the punks?
I hope you gettin your loot; just remember
What you spit in the booth
There's other people that's livin proof
Y'all cats with all the mouth, just stay in your lane
And pray that a real NUCCA don't decide to call you out",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-real-life-in-rap-lyrics

Money’s On Me,UnKnown,UnKnown,"I’m the best that ever did it
Shoe in for the race
But I’m turning blue in the face
I been holding my breath
Waiting on the rest of y’all to get it
Then your whole perception of who you view as a legend
It’ll probably change
So it’s probably best they don’t admit it
They won’t televise the revolution
I figured out a solution
All you need now is the net to be a witness
Positive if you want to test him for the sickness
You’ll be begging for forgiveness
Meanwhile I push the pedal on the stick shift
Metal on the misfit just in case it’s ever on
CRACCCCCCCK, anything my breath is on
And if you misunderstood that get Rosetta Stone nigga
If you thinking I’ma respond to you, no I won’t
They say the devil wears Prada, no I don’t
Into the art and my passion for the bars
More then fashion it’s a mindstate that other stars lacking
If you and your team get bread, why hate
You’re not getting it, tell me why is there a wait
I’m talking to everybody in the tri-state
That’s New York, Connecticut, my state
Whatever hip hop has turned into is different in my mental
I let y’all continue with the minstrel
Et cetera, me I’m just a replica
Of what two turntables a mic by a cold park bench do
Stop it frauds, can’t mock it cos it’s raw
I’m the closest thing to cardboard boxes on the floor
Anytime the track is up, jail cells acting up
Living room bagging up, subway tagging up
And niggas say I lost my mind
I know where to locate it if need be, believe me
On Pandora with the rest of my kind
Now you owe cause I invested my time
When the gun blow
And the shots fall
And the smoke clears
We’ll be right here, screaming out
Whatever niggas wanna do
My money’s on me, hope your money’s on you
When the gun blow
And the shots fall
And the smoke clears
We’ll be right here, screaming out
Whatever niggas wanna do
My money’s on me, hope your money’s on you
It’s a man’s sport, damn y’all the show’s here
Y’all can camcord, backpacker without the Jansport
Tight jeans, weird style, I don’t rap politics
Socially aware, but I rather not acknowledge it
Sneaking in dorms, but wasn’t on no college shit
How they think I’m crazy, what I’m showing them is moderate
You damn right I talk a lot of shit (why?)
Cos I don’t mind playing dodgeball with hollow tips
No success having, living off old times
In 010 you dragging that old shine back from 09
I don’t get you, every interview my dick in your mouth
I wasn’t that blessed when I was with you
Why they wanna make c4 ignite
Benzino called him weird, he couldn’t be more right
Too busy trying to do what you incapable of
Time is money when it comes to mine take it in blood
When the gun blow
And the shots fall
And the smoke clears
We’ll be right here, screaming out
Whatever niggas wanna do
My money’s on me, hope your money’s on you
When the gun blow
And the shots fall
And the smoke clears
We’ll be right here, screaming out
Whatever niggas wanna do
My money’s on me, hope your money’s on you
New year, same old, bad broad, waist hot
Burner staying on his own waist high
Rumours fall by the way side
They try but ‘til I may die
Best rapper in the whole world til the day I
Take ‘em to the cleaners
I make sure there’s a nina
In arms reach of every locker at all the arenas
Ice cold, not hot, never buzzed, has been
Wanna be, never was, mask on, leather gloves
Niggas ain’t shit, how the fuck is they a threat to us
Start the fight, next minute screaming out they set us up
All the blogging ain’t solving a thing
Niggas wouldn’t want a problem if they knew what it’d bring
While the light on his tunnel keep dimming, Ima keep winning
Rookie of the year, about a buck what up B. Jennings
Pointing guns online don’t let me know what’s real
Sometimes silence is the best overkill
When the gun blow
And the shots fall
And the smoke clears
We’ll be right here, screaming out
Whatever niggas wanna do
My money’s on me, hope your money’s on you
When the gun blow
And the shots fall
And the smoke clears
We’ll be right here, screaming out
Whatever niggas wanna do
My money’s on me, hope your money’s on you",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-moneys-on-me-lyrics
Heaven or Hell,Mood Muzik: The Worst of Joe Budden,2003,"Gotta watch my back
It ain't safe at night
There's too much to do
Gotta get my paper right
And there's a lot of my dogs
They either dead or in jail
But if I kill myself
Would it be heaven or hell?
Gotta watch my back
It ain't safe at night
There's too much to do
Gotta get my paper right
And there's a lot of my dogs
They either dead or in jail
But if I kill myself
Would it be heaven or hell?

Yo, at this present time there's a lot of nonsense at stake
Too many ideas and decisions left to contemplate
Too much to deal wit, too much to make a nigga have to steal shit
And it's hurtin' 'cause I gotta feel it with too much anger
Too many niggas know me, but they don't know me
Analayzed popular stranger, and peep how niggas try to change ya
But I can't cope with no antidote, two options, one is slittin' my wrists
Go to the precinct with a clip my fist
So I keep a cig in my lips, shit is painful, fuck suicide
Done did too much dirt to know if I'ma be angel
So help me god, cry in my sleep
'Cause you ain't pull me out of shark infested waters to die on the beach
And I was told ""don't trust, 'cause they plot at the end'
So I treat friends as nobodies, and nobody as friend
Yo, it just seems like trouble's followin' me, lock and key
Stuck in the belly of the beast, and it's swallowin' me
With no cream, with no bundle to hustle and no scheme
No niggas to run with and no team
Tell me what its like to have ran out of options when you goin' all out
Or what it's like to be in love and fall out
Just want to put it behind me and breathe without the fuckin' 9 to squeeze
Without the weed and Hennessy to keep my mind at ease
Without rollin' over, coilin' myself, tryin' to sleep
Without bein' homeless and starvin and dyin' to eat
Shit wasn't like this in the youth house
Throughout my teen years been forced to grow up too fast, ma'fucker I'm not a youth now
Wish I could let a lot of people see the true Mouse
But I'm too scared to see him myself, what'd be the use now?

I done changed too much
I guess the water ran dry
Man I been put through shit
For most of my life
And I done lost my breath
But still I'm tryna fight
I can't take no more
'Cause I'm dyin' inside

From houses to gas stations, I've done robbed 'em all
Facing 10 to 20, that'll start a robber's fall
Jacked whips in parking lots, I got the drop from Fords
And this amount of victims coming out a shopping mall
I'm a totally different nigga when I'm copping the raw
Apartments with A.D.T., got through the locks in the door
I met some dollared out chicks, somehow I got in the drawers
Seen niggas die in cold blood, they had got shot in the war
Want a seed for the wrong reasons, to see me different
In hopes of me guiding so he'll never have to see a prison
But my shorty got it fucked up
Or maybe I just got it fucked up, somebody got it fucked up
What a nigga got besides his music?
Thirsty as hell, can't smoke the water, 'cause I know that I'll abuse it
And ma'fuckers can't afford to see that fuse lit
They can't afford to see a nigga on some new shit
And where my pops at? Nigga need him now
Show up later on when I'm black, and fuck, I'm bleedin' now
Showin' my moms another side she never seen in me
How the fuck she don't understand when it's her genes in me?
How'd I progress in therapy while wantin' to leave this world?
And I know how to beat the system, can't beat the world
I talk that ""take my own life to get off the scene quick""
Unfortunate that I'm too much of a genius to really mean shit

Gotta watch my back
It ain't safe at night
There's too much to do
Gotta get my paper right
And there's a lot of my dogs
They either dead or in jail
But if I kill myself
Would it be heaven or hell?

I done changed too much
I guess the water ran dry
Man I been put through shit
For most of my life
And I done lost my breath

So Lonely,Mood Muzik: The Worst of Joe Budden,2003,"See the haters is still soupin and
Y'all ain't happy to hear that I'm really couping it
Haters I'm really doing it
You can't step to me, I'm awkward, I box lefty
Nah, better yet I'm ambidextrous, I can do it with both
Haters tried to put a stop to it, I had to do it with toast
They don't like that I don't do it like most, muhfucka
Can't help the fact that I spit up acid
I'm from A Different World
Son I'm Dwayne Wayne without the flip up glasses, dog
A lot of you herbs be phony
I never said I'm the illest, but at this present time I'm Jersey's only
Trying desperately to wrap me up, started to fight with the game
Now what other rapper from my hood'll back me up?
And now they mad in the streets, but if I was wack it'd peace
And I never asked to be part of rap's elite
I was like y'all, struggling, I lived in my mom's crib
Then I dropped a couple freestyles and the people responded
And now when you flip about the stations
DJs holler ""let's take it to Jersey""
All you hear is, uh, ""salutations!""
I'm working hard on my grind I'm about to make it
See my cloud is raising, why can't I manage without the hating
The sooner the greater, if everything was peace
We could be a Unit like Flavor
Look around, you bout to ruin it hater
With a major, still I'm working myself
And I'm right where I wanna be so you only hurting yourself
Hoping I shelf, I'm promoting myself
And the bottom line is that hating is just self-centeredness just showing itself
Wanna bust off to hit me cause all the twenties in the loft is crispy
And all the streets want is Jumpoff and 50
Die traitor, asking me why playa
When I breeze through, all I do is look at you
Hi hater
Best friends become strangers, you shady dunn
And I done gave you some guidance, you chasing my baby moms
I used to feel I'm your man, know what that feel like my man?
How you look yourself in the mirror, still feel like a man?
Joey
Future greatest, I ain't twisted at all
And four albums down the line you can say you witnessed it all
Just think, you could say we had some business before
You could go as far as saying that we was niggas before
But it's just me and my box of bogeys I can't flock with you clonies
God damn being on top, it's so lonely
Sony say I sound like Grafh
I was signed a good year and a half before he popped up
Don't say I'm trying be something I'm not, what
Joe Budden dogs, I'm back in the circuit, the block is shut
This fall is a hot season
Def Jam invited me here and I'm not leaving
Just me and my box of bogeys, got my Glock as my homie
God damn being on top, it's so lonely",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-so-lonely-lyrics
Tipsy,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Check it… baby sweetie lady darling
It don’t, get no better than this
And I know, guys will go to any measure to hit
But I hope, you don’t use that as a measuring stick
They priorities is off, busy treasuring whips
I just like the opportunity of pleasuring miss
Since I never met another that get wetter than this
Anytime I'm tour you’ll forever be missed
Cause I knew she was a fantasy dream
Every Sunday all she worry about is her fantasy team
And anytime shorty speed pass in that E-Class
Body so sick that I always wanna tea bag
So I spend, hit a mall maybe Soho
Cause how she blessed me, swore her jaw broke though
Her sex to me, is like a midnight ecstasy
So the bar could be closed as long as she next to me

Baby I’m Tipsy, so let’s stay love drunk
Baby I’m Tipsy, so let’s stay love drunk
Oh Baby I’m Tipsy, so let’s stay love drunk
Let's stay love drunk, let's stay love drunk
See baby I'm Tipsy,so let’s stay love drunk
Baby I’m Tipsy, so let’s stay love drunk
Oh Baby I’m Tipsy off you, so let’s stay love drunk
Let's stay love drunk, let's stay love drunk

Check it.. see the beauty of it all is
We could both have whoever we please
But ummm, we’d only be fooling ourselves
Cause it seems without each other we would never be pleased
It’s much more than her body though I value her ways
See shorty knows the value of space, she don’t crowd me
Open minded, know she don’t got all the answers
When we hit the strip club she tipping all the dancers
I’m trying to show you things that you ain’t used to
Talking water front villas out in St. Lucia
Turn our cells off, nothing else matters
Took it slow but it couldn’t happen any faster
She don’t go through the phone
She say if that’s necessary than she rather be alone
Can tell she for real by the sound of her tone
Shorty grown, no chaser she got me in the zone


Best part about it all it’s not difficult
You such a standout, nowhere near typical
Plus you let me be my own individual
You know if you support me you’ll get every residual
And when girls try to tell you that I’m cheating
You agree saying they don’t even know the half
Cause how I got shorty, it ain’t even fair
Though it all adds up they can’t seen to do the math

No Henn’ or glass of Rosé (Rosé)
Could make my world spin around just like you do
They just don’t taste the same

First off, I'm not competin, I'm more like stampedin, I'm more like steamrollin (or)
More like puttin my foot on the neck of the game until I see it chokin
I hold on for dear life (I mean, uh), the flow is air tight and the bars are bar none
Regarded as the one, fuck music, it's a art to son
Let's rewind, see, I was born in the projects, left for a new hood
Jetted to a new state, lookin for a new pace
Diamond in the rough, I stood out amongst the fugaz'
Swear a friend a mine headlined every news page (cheah), with dreams of bein wealthy
You now checkin out the New Jersey version of Peter Petrelli
But wait, with a little Travis Barker on the side
Cause when it all falls down, I normally survive
I'm tryin to see a new tax bracket, so I'll never have to grab 'matics
I ain't concerned with no rap racket (ah!)
So y'all could take my name through the mud and drag it
Spread it to the masses, (I'm a), I still play it passive (yeah!)
I got no choice but walk around with the lead on me
Life is way too short, too many dead homies (or)

So if a nigga wanna go to war, wave hi to death
I mean he lives right next to me, so he ain't a threat to me

Still spit like it ain't no tomorrow
It ain't over y'all, underrated so I overcharge
Old Dodge, radio off, fuck a station
Get to know me through the music, not a publication (nah)
It's no justification, (but a), I mean enough with the waitin (I mean I)
I lost all my trust and my patience
That came without the crown or the chair or the robe
Nigga, I don't care what you sold (wait a minute!)
They let the beast out of the cage, look at the hunger
Got yourself into some shit, look at the plunger
I'm talkin cause I'm livin it (oh!)
Entrepreneur Steve Rifkind shit, though a few haters wanna hinder it
I'm comin with some different shit
And these offices all about my paper, that's that Dunder Mifflin shit
Rapper on 'roids, sick with the thoughts (but)
But managed to keep my name out the Mitchell Report
See I'm a, inspiration for a whole generation
Even when I'm gone but my message in syndication
Then you too can attain the unattainable (but)
But fuck tryin to explain the unexplainable

Nigga, fuck
Uh, done talkin to these niggas
Nahmean?
Who the fuck am I to try to explain some shit to niggas?

I'm Omar Epps, who got the ""Juice"" now?
Street love nigga, G's up nigga
You lookin for a loan on your re-up nigga
Haters might wanna put hollows in ya
When you're young black spendin like a lotto winner y'know
I'm grown up now, I'm done with Jake
When I say pounds y'all I'm talkin bout London cake
I can serve it to you uncut or somethin baked
Hope you ready for me folks, cause I'm comin your way, cause

Star Inside of Me,Mood Muzik Vol. 3.5 ,2007.0," (Suzy Q)
(A staaaarrr)
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
One two, one two
(Is inside of meeeee)
One two, one two
Uh, uh, uh
Nod ya head, if you want clap ya hands to it
It's just music, you feel like it dance to it
Uh, uh, come on
 (*echo*)
Name of this record right here is called Star Inside
Shout to Dub B on the beat
Let's go

If you feel like I feel it's all love, what up?
Now throw ya motherfuckin fingers in the air, (oh), yeah
Mr. On Fact, here to do it like on fact, this ain't about rap
If you ain't come to feel good, we gonna do it without you
Too low, turn the music louder, yeah
Turn the music loud in here
You understand that what y'all about to hear
Feelin myself, homie what?
See I'm a leader, won't show me up
Nah, see they won't slow me down, won't slow me up
Sky's the limit, 'til I die and I'm in it
But that's not the case tonight
Pop a case tonight
Like whatever you want do, it's okay tonight
See cause all of that salt we gon' shake tonight
Now bring the break aight
 - w/ ad libs
I'm just tryin to be me
Cause there's only one me
Strip away materials and seriously
These things don't make me
Nothin can break me
I shine because a star is inside of me
 (Suzy Q)
I write Mood Muzik, know a lot of you ain't used to
Jot my life on wax, I'm puttin you through it
No lies, it's all truth to it
Do the music cause it's (inside of me) 
Fans wanted the real, I went and gave it to 'em
I'm not a street nigga, nah just relate to 'em
I just relay through 'em
Show the way to 'em, never fake to 'em, that ain't (inside of me) 
Don't be afraid, show the World who you are
Go and show the World you a star 
Reach to the stars, go ahead show the World that it's ours
And then the World'll know that it's (inside of me)
40 acres and a mule to, 40 K's on the Mueller
See I'm just thinkin of ways to get my dudes up
They use to say we was losers
I beg to differ, that ain't me, now
 - w/ ad libs

Give it to 'em Joe
Give it to 'em Joe
Give it to 'em Joe
(You got it)
 (Suzy Q)
They say if you don't stand for nothin, you'll fall for anything
Cause of that there, I see the whole game on the ground
Watchin what works, we all chasin a hit
Instead of takin a risk, so we changin our sound now
Now we all chase jewels, big trucks and income
All that and then some, chase whatever trend come 
At least 'til the trend's done 
But that don't change within none 
And I'm not sayin to not have a Benz son
Rings that shiny, whatever things' timely
Those things help to unwind me 
But naw those things don't help define me
Aim at the basics, aim you can make it
Cause even when the whole game seems tainted
I'm a star without the chains and the bracelets
Cause that fly shit is (inside of me)
 - w/ ad libs

A glow is comin from my heart
Open yours and find a star
(Hey!) ...
(Hey!)

Pusha Man,Joe Budden,2003.0,"Say blood, heh-heh, what's happening?
What you mean blood? I got what you need (Pusha man nigga!)
Go around this corner with me real quick (ohh!)
(Fuck you thought?) Oh shit, watch out for thug (Pusha man)
Man you got to be cool blood
Gotta feel you right here, niggas down for whatever

Everybody's so gangsta gangsta, tell me how you do it
Keep the façade that real when you not that real, that's real!
The strip is hot so I don't hear my foes beefin
That's telling me that I bought all these burners for no reason
Come, get me thug I walk with a mini teeny-tiny eeny-weeny snub
And real niggas give me love
Besides, don't make me feel like you threaten my life God (why?)
I go and cop something that only come with a Tripod
(And the) Old school is puff puff, pass the spark up
And white kids got high, off of magic marker
Back when 40s was liquor (but now) now shorties is bigger
They wanna be down, y'all wannabe clowns, get a grip homes
Blasting the tool, you out of character dude
You not a felon or rider, you a fellow subscriber
Who is you telling them lies to, don't push it to a limit
To mimic you benefiting to what, the gimmicks up, BLAH

When shit get thick, clips start to spit (pusha man)
Push work wait wet and dipstick (pusha man)
You need product, I'mma be there, con of the year
Fuck giving my word, I solemnly swear
Swear to hold down the fort - I solemnly swear
Keep a straight face in court - I said I solemnly swear
It's pusha man - incognito from the feds in the precinct
I solemnly swear to this game I pledge my allegiance

Uhh.. it's killing me soft, jokers is actin like they really the boss
With a Milli Vanilli award cause they really a fraud
Milli's applaud if you ain't really my dawg
I crack Phillies with broads but now I'm sober they don't feel me no more
And G.P.s and V.I.P.s
I be O-T in D.C. with O-Zs so my time's up like O.C
Uhh, when I hustle they thought that I went soft
Cause y'all jerked them for the price, I took twenty percent off
I don't drive I like shotguns, never pulled L's
I like shotguns, hate .22's I like shotguns
Non-descrip's talking bout they got guns
Like tecs 4-5s and shotguns, really they never shot guns
Go 'head act like a gangsta, claim to clap like a gangsta
Saw Goodfellas, now he rap like a gangsta
Hate me or love me, dap me or slug me
Scream ""Fuck me"" when things get ugly I get gully


Look, a cock nina should get me a hot Beamer
Setting up shop in the suburbs, I'm getting that white cream that Noxema
I'm good at ducking the cops subpoena
Cats is shook when alone but come tough when the cops are between us
Stash house was never empty, had the cracks on up
Soprano came to see me, got baritoned up
Had clientele crazy, every borough I hustled
Remember back in the day when you had to be thorough to hustle?
Cats hustle to feed they kin
Now every combo with a package to try to pitch for some sneakers and Timbs
Shit back in the day, niggas looked at jail like school
Now new jacks is spitting bout jail like it's cool (dawg)
That ain't gangsta, I don't believe that, you don't believe it yourself
Gangsta's real, gangsta speaks for itself
A lot of gangstas is lifers and they gone right now
So fag cats is screaming gangsta, something's wrong right now",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-pusha-man-lyrics
For a Reason,Mood Muzik 2: Can It Get Any Worse?,2006.0,"Chorus:
Lookin back on the things ive done
Everything happens for a reason
Life is somethin u learn from
Everything happens for a reason
I gotta make a confession theres nothin im regretting
Lifes a valuable lesson to have to pull out a weapon
So dont make me
Life is something u learn from
Everything happens for a reason
Joey B, you know me B
It's the nigga that would tryn' get the blow on GP
It's the nigga in the hood on the low G3
It's the nigga some niggas want so does he please
Is it 'cause he make the flow look so easy
Or do he sit and count up all the dough that he see
Or do they wanna prove they OG and use me
To get the guns out, sending him to ODB
But what I ever did to a nigga? Aside give to a nigga
Try to show the big pic to a nigga
But I can't conclude how some niggas conclude
That the world is too small for them to live with a nigga
I don't regret dude trying me, dude keeping that eye on me
Then they gotta live with this thing called irony
And if I gotta live with the idea reminding me
Then they can't live when the iron's on me, yeah!
Chorus:
Lookin back on the things ive done
Everything happens for a reason
Life is somethin u learn from
Everything happens for a reason
I gotta make a confession theres nothin im regretting
Lifes a valuable lesson to have to pull out a weapon
So dont make me
Life is something u learn from
Everything happens for a reason
Things just ain't the same for gangstas
And so I bear my soul, my pain, my anger
I beg to the Lord, keep me far from mo' danger
Look I know 'em but can't see 'em, he's a popular stranger
If I never got stabbed, wouldn't remember Veronica's wrath
Standing in the shower looking at the scab
I wouldn't know the hints of a stick-up kid
If I ain't have that short stint as a stick-up kid
If dude never tried to kill me, I mighta went numb
To all the bullshit that goes on where I'm from
And if I never went to jail, wouldn't needed a bail
Woulda probly went on to graduate from Yale
Woulda been a prosecutor standing in the court of law
But then that goes against everything he stands for
And if I never met Glo, how would I really know
All the shit that comes with, when you dealing with a ho
See it is what it is to be
Or it is what it is, at least that's what it is to me
And so if I could ever go back in history
I wouldn't change shit, I'd leave it all just to be
And if my first album woulda did five when it dropped
I'd be chillin, instead of tryna' rise to the top
If I could reverse the roles, would I reverse the roles?
Would it be worth it to try to reverse the tolls?
Chorus:
Lookin back on the things ive done
Everything happens for a reason
Life is somethin u learn from
Everything happens for a reason
I gotta make a confession theres nothin im regretting
Lifes a valuable lesson to have to pull out a weapon
So dont make me
Life is something u learn from
Everything happens for a reason
I got a brother always keeps it real, his name's Guilt
Let's me know I can't stand however it is I feel
I got a cousin named Pride, nigga acts like a lawyer
Gotta a sister named Karma, I be tryna' avoid 'er
Gotta ex that's bitter, wants me to be her nigga
Hates my girl Self-Pity 'cause I'm always with her
But bitter's beef is valid, she don't like shorty 'cause she use me
One time she seen 'er verbally abuse me
Got a friend that's passive, friends call him Passive
He just says whatever hoping that shit passes
My Uncle Hindsight wears real thick glasses
Reminds me of where I been and how shit gets drastic
Got a Aunt named Humility, she speaks low mumbles
Don't care that I'm a rapper she keeps me so humble
In my head I'll debate it, outloud I'll never say it
I'm pretty sure it's a good reason we all related",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-for-a-reason-lyrics

I'm hearin all the talk of how you ride with a heater
Make sure I don't survive but when I see ya
Ya sleep with a broke heart like you went and took advice from Alicia
Tell me if you really wanna take it there
Best in the world if you ain't been made aware
Latest gear, loved? No, hated yeah
You and your scared style'll get aired out, Stars, stop and stare now
Change the trucks grill yeah the car got veneers now
Lot of rappers spitting shit, I don't wanna hear now
They talking Gucci but they shopping at Sears now
If you weren't prepared now? You ain't get the warnin yet
So I'm a go hard early call it morning sex

Tinted up, rims silly
If a nigga try and kill me chalk it up as the brother wildin
With mind playing tricks on you get off Shutter Island
Showin you somethin you never would see, I'm gettin checks every week
You tryin to meet your executive needs, I'm in executive suites consecutively
Somebody had to body ya, guess the job was left to me
So when I kill the track they can't charge me with double jeopardy
They asked you if I'm a boss and you say no sir
How you don't concur my gopher got a chauffeur
Standing on the couch in the club with a nympho
Repping Slaughterhouse see the blood on the window
I'm trying to get wealthy, being broke isn't healthy
So I ain't tryin to buy whatever shit they try to sell me
Got a broad up in the telly I could trust her what you tell me
Still bringin Lunatics with me yeah I learned that trick from Nelly
Cause I know it can get urgent, when they see you just splurgin
Strip club, in the private room tryin to fix the curtains
Wanna cause a big excursion run up on the kid squirtin
Make sure the Mac ain't broke and you ain't buy the Knicks version

Get the Picture,UnKnown,UnKnown," (Joe Budden Speaking)
Lord, grant me the serenity
To accept the things I cannot change
And the courage to change the things i can
And the wisdom to know the difference

Lord im trying to keep good faith
But it seems like I'm the nigga that the hood hates
Did my dirt, thought I was past that
Lord I feel like I'm being laughed at
I got some issues they making me wanna backtrack
I tried to talk about it, less as I could
But I'm starting to feel strange when I'm repping my hood
Some haters they trying to make me rumble
See me headed for the goal with the ball they trying to make me fumble
It's some bullshit, beef back around the way
Should I pick up the pound tre, blow these clowns away?
Catch 'em puffing on a ounce of yay
Drive by, let a couple of rounds spray, then bounce to VA?
Should I ask God to show me a sign, had to see something?
Totally forgetting about the fact I gotta see it coming
Worse case scenario is you and me dead
Cause some niggas dont get the picture 'til the eulogy's said
Lord I can't to talk to niggas, their ears won't listen
And if I do whats in my nature...there's no missing
See I tried to avoid beefing
But if I pop this nigga then fuck it...everything happens for a reason
Lord grant me serenity to not murder my enemies
Doing a 100 on Kennedy 'til the feds finish me
Mouse'll do the gat shit, put a tool to the bastard
Joe says to kill 'em breathing and pursue this rap shit
Fall back or cock back, I ain't fighting no more
I tried to show niggas love and they ain't like what they saw
Lord this gotta be me with 2 guns on my waist
Cause what I look like, running away, never the case
Throwing blows at my set gettin bold with threats
Only reason your block breathing is I sold my tech
Now snakes are gettin smarter
And when the haters wanna hear something in particular they listen harder
I left town looked that shitty coming back
But fuck I'm just tryin to put my city on the map
It's becomin to be a problem that I rap this hard
I tried to start the takeover and come back for ya'll
Lord should I start to war wit a bunch of felons?
Should I hold the city hostage put it under surveillance?
Somebody's trying to knock down the shit that I built
Is that enough to make me live with the guilt? answer back
What if I get off family grieving within?
Friends sayin what a great rapper he could have been
But Lord if that happens then revenge is next
What if my dogs get killed tryin to avenge my death?
I'm thinkin all love ya thinking the kid is nervous
I think partners, you think I reneged on purpose
Should I shed the blood of a cat I once shed blood for?
Should i kill a nigga that I once had love for?
Aight partner since you love to hate
Wanna play the ace of hearts like I won't cut with a spade
Figure worse case scenario is you and me dead

Vietnam,True to the Game Pt. 5: Duffle Bag Edition,UnKnown,"So many praying that Ran fell, you can't tell?
These people expecting Heaven but never could they withstand Hell
I Die Hard like Bruce Willis and Samuel
Sipping Champale and party harder than Manziel
Vodka and tonic got me thinking like Prophet Muhammad
I'm not an Islamic I'm a product of copping narcotics
I'm hot as a comet, hoes give me top til they vomit
Something exotic, Carribean, Dominican goddess
The shit is symbolic, powerful performances
Bars made of 24 karats, so fuck the choruses
Huh, niggas know I'm raw with the rhymes
Cause I'm known to off sides with these offensive lines
Leave em lost in the Vines, you thinking it's social media
I'm thinking it's deep in the jungle with hopes of leaving ya
Slitting ya throat and bleeding ya, you ain't got a chance to live
Smoke a nigga wig off, leave em just like a cancer kid (damn)
I know that I'm a little insensitive
Grew up kinda poor, we barely had any cents to live
Now it's Peter Luger's, cutting up an expensive rib
Cursing out the bums, cause I ain't got any cents to give
They saying I'm not the one
I leave em full of clips like the moon blocking the sun
When these goons cocking they guns, they don't even see the car
Roll around the mud in fatigues like I'm in Vietnam

Ya nahmean
Jersey's front court
Vietnam, I know
I'm gonna talk about it
Parks is Parks for a reason
Right here? Beautiful, look
I'ma need those fatigues since I'm out here like a bounty
Traded the green jumper they gave me when I hit county
Nah, I'm sorry, I need my pilot seat
I say that speaking from the clouds, these are pilot 
Probably why these model bitches wanna ride with me
If I can't say it publicly, then I won't say it privately
Just how real I could spit it, it's whatever you wanna bet
A nigga got a few million in liquid
Gotta stop son from peeling that biscuit
We'll always have more to lose dog, it's just a feeling I live with
With this one side bitch that'll mourn me if I let her
So don't call me for whatever but a orgy or better
I'm just standing on the ceiling they told me I'd never meet
Took the pop out ularity, in spots you would dare to see
God could take mine right now, let it be painful
Cause every dream a nigga ever had came true
Shooting 100 from the field, just a path I create
They told me I could never have it this great
So even with a million motherfuckers grabbing my legs
Still knock the barrel down so the crabs can escape
Made believers out the fakes, was Caesar to the apes
For niggas that wasn't sure that we would see another day, Joey
Self-employed, so if I'm on that island by myself
Self-deployed, don't help that boy, I'm good
Ya nahmean
It's simple
Simple shit
Just logic
Just talking logic to em
One and one make two

People can't relate to it, don't understand it
Cause they ain't never been there, they ain't from there
I understand it
 (*echo*)
As we wrap this shit up
We call this one +Still My Hood+

Even though they hate 'em (oh), even though when a nigga try to make a come up
(It's a), it's another nigga waitin just to run up
Though they sellin rocks for shorts
And every night around twelve you hear them shots go off (talk to 'em)
And know niggas is rats, some boys is wired
And the food in the supermarket's all expired (whoa)
Every block's a liquor store, an abandoned building
Drunk parents at the liquor store abandonin children (let's go)
Though the sky seems gray, we'll get through the weather
And even though they fill our grade schools with metal detectors
Some cops is crooked and police indecent
And you can catch a body up the street from the precinct
Though we got a lot of shit wrong, a lot of shit goin on
Gotta love it, this the place I was born, so I sit here dedicatin this song
This is still my hood
 - w/ ad libs
Now everywhere I roam, though they keep the chrome, it's no place like home
This is still my hood
And it's far from fine, I may like other places but they far from mine
Gotta love my hood
And I only know one place that be like that, if I ever leave, trust
I'll be right back
It's my hood
It may not be good, it may not be like it should
But let me get one thing understood, this is still my hood

Shout to Wyks on the beat
Can't forget NV, what up nigga?

You know they got them Macs out until ya time's up
And the barbers'll fuck ya line up (this is still my hood)
Hold up cause even though
You can't meet a girl ain't fucked a nigga you know (gotta love my hood)
This the same place you can't get a job
They look at you, like you young and you black
Get the fuck out of dodge (fuck out of here)
Get a gun, get some crack, feel like that's our only op'
Tell ourselves we'll fall back as soon as that money stop (oh!)
They feast on ya watch (and)
And dudes stand on the corner like if life passes us by at least we
Wanna watch (talk to 'em)
Clowns get extorted (whoa), gangstas get recorded (whoa)
Mami don't know if she should keep it or abort it (get rid of it)
Cops you'll never will catch me, I'm aware all my warrants
And I'm not goin down (naw), naw that's not goin down (nah)
Carjackings, shootouts is imperial here
And I dare you find a ratchet with the serial, yeah
Though you might have to raise ya gun, just to raise ya sums
This ain't the place you want to raise ya son (never that)
A few dudes'll argue about they favorite rapper
Other dudes sit and think of different ways they could yak ya
Don't take it personal, it's just the paper they after
So I keep mine on me, just in case I might have to
And still no other place that I'd rather
Gotta love my hood
 - w/ ad libs

If you've never been, you can't really know about it (naw)
System's fucked up, the jails is overcrowded (whoa)
Murder rates is up and as a matter of fact
A couple of close friends of mine have added to that
And I rate nothin above it, I know it seems odd but I hate it and I love it (naw)
Naw, I hate that I love it (yeah, yep)
The same things that seem to get me always pissed
As soon as I leave, I always miss, it's always like this
So small, everybody knows everybody
It's body after body, it's robbery after robbery
Hookers on the strip, some girls'll be a ho
We got a few local legends, I guess the world'll never know
From Jers to Little Rock, the hood'll never die down
B-More, D.C., Compton, Chi-Town, New York to VA, ya town's like my town
Let's go
 - 2X - w/ ad libs

Whoa!
This goes out to everybody in every hood man
No matter where ya at, where ya from

Vancouver, London, T. Dot
Wherever you at, I don't even care man (*fades out*)",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-still-my-hood-lyrics
Letter to Saigon,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Who knew
When he was introduced to the world by Webb
He'd be the greatest rapper in the World Wide Web
I mean, assholes' opinions are like assholes
I'm past those, so you could tell the world I said
Learned from Kanye about Common Sense
Make GOOD Music, gotta face the Consequence
They want me to reach for mine while the seat's reclined
How dumb would that be when I ain't even reach my prime
Speak my mind and niggas start feeling a way
Say what I feel, it ain't my fault they feel what I say
Seem like in every interview, niggas wanna mention dude
You took my good punchline, got it misconstrued
Ain't diss you then but nigga now I will
I'm just saying how I feel
Got your camera showing off your tiny townhouse and a girl car
Cause you ain't a world star, not even on Worldstar
The Greatest Story Never Told won't be ever told
Mixtapes never sold, leak the shit, let it go
How you gonna be a big name in the future
Not even big named as a loser
You backed by a big named producer who gave the smash to T.I
Can't even be mad at Just, cause I can see why
Which leads me to wonder what the fans would see
If we turned to Saigon TV
We'd see a artist struggling to get buzzing with the best production
And looked weaker, when that Jay-Z feature didn't help
Fronting with conscious spitting about conscious living
I see, conscious fiction from a contradiction
Listen, I see a insecure nigga trying to prove something
Getting desperate cause his music don't move nothing
So what he do, start flashing bread
You could tell he probably ain't used to having bread, listen
I see a nigga stay talking bout the kids
But wanted nothing to do with one when it was his
You would take her phone calls til she said ""it's yours""
That's when they got crisscrossed, you started getting ignor
I see a nigga just fiending for scrunity
So he show us pics of how musclebound he used to be
I have shooters loaded up at niggas
Put plastic everywhere Lola Luv ass nigga
To that other nigga that had me on my bullshit
Rule 1: don't get sheep into some wolf shit
Trust, I'ma see the MF soon
That ain't him behind the mask, he like MF DOOM
But let's get back to Sai, as far as SOB's
I'da done the same thing and been proud, I wouldn'ta cried
You jetted on tape nigga, how you gon lie?
So if you're feeling like a sucka then ask yourself ""why?""",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-letter-to-saigon-lyrics

We do this, Joe Budden
Yeah, Young Chris, what, what?
Yeah, uh

To the heart of North of 'delph, pour my spirit and flesh
Give me the crown, watch me wear it the best
I ain't hearin' the rest
Long gone, dancin' with bigger fish here
Fish scale advances for glitter wrist wear
Ch-chea, motherfucker this year Chris here
Homie the strong's so vital, survival of the fits here
Ain't shit sweet y'all, life about a bitch yeah
Say I drive her crazy though I ride that ho fifth gear
Talk so much poverty 'cause I live here
Talk facility 'cause my family's doin' a bid there
You ain't rappin' or ballin', we got our hustle out
That's what a thug about, anything to get the fuck up out
The ghetto, dodge the devil, prolong my demise
Got a green sticky lye, baby, 365

Hold up, a nigga went from lukewarm to hot
Scratch that, from coldest winter to hell's kitchen
Aside from predictable shots and shells spittin'
Wouldn'ta even known it 'cause nothin' felt different
E'rything dope in this game ain't on the radio
That proofs me, check the dames and the ratio
Brain like fellatio, I mean it used to be 'caine like Horatio
Fuck you, pay me though
Hood form, style in whatever I put on
Come from where you give a wrong look and you would look wrong
Broads off the hook for him
But I treat 'em like Subway, I give 'em 5 dollars and a FOOT long
Young niggas take your vitamins
Your 28-inch rims higher than watchin' me admirin'
JUMP OFF, e'rything that they aspirin' to be
But the bullshit gets tiresome to me
See, only one concern, gettin' my bread right
Hate to see you lose your Life over a website
I'll feel Sorry
Y'all'll only know what I show, I Chris Brown and Rihanna that real story
Off putting words together like Scrabble
Build your Monopoly, they just gon' attack you
Can't Pictionary it, they gon' think it's Taboo

, oh my god (Stack Bundles)
Real talk nigga, oh my god (Desert Storm)
 shit, oh my god (DJ OnPoint, Joe Budden)
 (let's go, DJ OnPoint)

They call me F-A-Beezy, sometimes Stizzo
The wrist on freezy, neck on glizzo
The coupe move easy at two-double-izzo
Truck look cheezy 
And it's jacked up like it sit on stilettos
Can't you see the glit' on the pebble that sit on the bezel
None of you little scraps couldn't get on my level
Take more than a hot song to try to sit on the devil
Got respect when I killed ""Money, Power"" the first time
When they tried to knock down the towers the first time
And the only reason I'm talking 'bout it
Is so you know the real talk of New York's about it
I'm with a bitch, with a tight ass that shakes
Her suck game will one gulp: White Castle shakes
Got the home right past the lake
When I came they stop us, this time might blast the jake
I'm the nigga on the couches in clubs
And I stand out from the rest of the slouchers and scrubs
Bottles and bottles with a train of pretty hoes
That look like they could be amazing videos
We in the caps with the Yankee logos
Blowing on the stanky dro dro, the pinky snow-globe
And you know the link be so ""oh""
Niggas look fast but the blinks be slow-mo
I could spot a kinky ho though
All hood bitch, she just tryna make you think she SoHo
Plus I know the game like the back of my hand
When I'm lazy, you can catch me in the back of sedans
When I'm gone, you can bet I'm coming back with a tan
With the Mickey D signs on the back of my pants
And I act like the man, 'cause this my time
Plus the hood say they miss my dimes, it's young money

Yeah, DJ Clue
Desert Storm (is this what you want, man?)
Y'all can't fuck with my wolves, man, for real (huh?)
Come on y'all, yeah (is this what you want?)

Now niggas say they in the hood like Mister Softee
They in the hood getting treated like Mister Softie
“I clap the four-fifth”, if you believe that
Then you believe Rick James died of natural causes
I'm twisting up trees-chronic to switching up ebonics
Started in the fifth grade, switching up etonics
Know a few dudes that'll spit at your dome
So go see 'em if you really want invisible stones
Try and get at me to hit him
Just type forty acres and a mule in your navi system
My hood—they kidnapping your kids
See, we try and Tom Cruise and Jamie what collateral is
Whack dudes in the game is a problem
But they like Maurice Malone jeans, their name will stay on the bottom
Murdering that? Nah, heard him, he's sub-par
Coyote Ugly rappers, keep working at your bars

(Yeah) Yeah, y'all know who it is
Uh-huh (SLK) 
Motherfucker, I'm Cain (Paul Cain)  fuck 

Cain got the heart of a soldier, mind of a general
Strategy is important, timing is critical
We wear tracks out, lyrically I'm a beast
From Brooklyn's backbone, epitome of the streets
Only the strong survive, if you physically weak
You get gunbutted, stabbed, shot, and critically beat
'Cause listen, ain't no shook hands in Brooklyn
Presidential with the matching bullet bracelet, it's a good look, man
Call me whatever, I hustle and I rap a little
You see the color stones chain look like a pack of Skittles
I give 'em anthrax, every bar is that official
I know I'm a gangster, I ain't got to pack a pistol
I don't rap in riddles, I give it to a nigga
Straight, no chaser, I'm like Hen' on the rocks
If it ain't the fifth, it's probably the Glock
I'm the nigga Clue and Duro call when they need the bodies to drop
If it ain't the chain, it's probably the watch
When I ride if it ain't the truck or sedan, it's probably the drop
Play the block, I don't party a lot
I'm the one who sent the goon with the snub to get the jewels from the club
I could never blow all my dough
When I get at least ten people robbed at all my shows
And all I know: money, clothes, birds, and cars
Running from Po's, champagne, furs, and R's
Quite sure you must've heard of the God
If not I'm Cain, Triangle Offense, I'm a third of the squad
I'm the first line of the defense, the star point guard
Is back starting, y'all be used to riding the bench
 fuck that ""no women, no kids"" shit
When the shotty blows, everybody goes, business is business
But dig this, fuck a guilty conscience
I'll put a slug in you, really give you something to live with
Fuck street fighting, I pull a hammer in a split second
The kid breathe fire, and speak lightning
These niggas ain't writing
All they did was analyze my flow, and use my style so their liking, nigga

Fuck (yeah), yeah

Cold World,The Album Before The Album,2007.0,"You are now listening to The Growth (haha)
Let me talk to them...

See I was always looking for an out
Knew what I ain't want to be about
Ain't want to fall victim to the crowd
'Street Dreams' like Fab, but not dreams like that
Cuz even his is better than the dreams I've had
They say you are where you're from, maybe to some
But I won't let a nigga label me slum and make me succumb
If I'm a grown ass man with no job, no money, that would make me a bum
It's not o.k. with me none
It's what they called me, I hated that y'all
Wasn't a 'College Dropout,' least Kanye made it that far
Tenth grade parted ways, like later for that y'all
I was bored with it, wasn't no paper in that, naw
So I pulled a few capers, that came to a stop
When I realized that ain't no bigger gang than the cops
Pray tell, I could rebel and blast a shot
Cuz jail's a revolving door, but the casket's not (ya herd)

Cuz everyday, of my life (yea)
I've tried so hard to get right (talk to them)
But nothing seems to matter when you
Got so much coming at you (oh)
In this world they say, just be strong
But it ain't easy when you hurt so long
And it's a shame
Nothing's changed no matter how far you go
In this cold cold world...

O.k., now we got little brothers that wanna deal on the strip (cold, cold world)
Or we got little sisters that feel they gotta strip
Swinging on the pole have us feening over tits
And a lot of us horny niggas, we ain't even gonna tip
BUT! Nothings wrong with it at all, I respect it
But we always take something short term and try to stretch it
Bread's gonna G a lot of niggas when they learn that fast
Money comes fast and it leaves a lot quicker
Nigga, we in a place that's to every extreme
In a place where niggas die over the pettiest things
And it seems to been deterrent shit
But we don't carry guns to kill now, niggas carry burners to live
So, God it's me a-gain, our father who art in Heaven
Hallowed be thy name, pray them hollows never hit my frame
Everyday I'm around it
Everyday I'm surrounded
Everyday I try to say grounded in this cold, cold world


We living in a place where niggas tooling each other
Where the President and terrorists are cool with each other
Sending millions in the war make us duel with each other
And hit Bin Laden on his cell like 'I got em making fools of each other'
Got us in a hole, pigeoned
Why I can't talk to niggas, that's just so indignant
People are so ignant
Till a wise man sat me down, like 'Joe listen'
You can't 'conversate' with a nigga with no diction
And I don't watch the news (nah)
I don't wanna hear about another kidnapping, another kid clapped in
Mom killing her seed, got another kid trapped
In the car, kid gasping like, *cough*
So you clowns can run around with your pounds and your war stories
But I ain't choose to be hood, shit was forced on me
It's not what I endorse homey
Cuz I know that's where they wanna keep us, stop us from being leaders (you know)",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-cold-world-lyrics
Only Girl,Mood Muzik: The Worst of Joe Budden,2003,"Still got Jerz on his Back!!
Matter fact Jerz is Back!

It's regular Joe Partner, Rap is so Popular
Swear we gotta be the highest rated soap opera
Now a days it ain't about whoever flow hotter
Its about gimmick, image and whoever gross dollars
While I try to be me. Just a Man with issues
They even complained then. Some fans is so fickle
Cause ya'll fall for it. Ya'll niggas believe em
Gotta learn how to read em. Gotta learn how to weed 'em
If somebody promoting gangsta, Dudes reaching
Cause Gangsta and Promoters are like two different regions
I'm so tired of beefing
Shit'll only end in another man leaking and another man Bleeding
Especially the rap beef. I Hate Rap Beef
Half these cats ain't real. They Only Rap Beef
Half these cats should chill. That's if you ask me
Cause if you catch em with the Mill Then its a track meet
Plus I feel like every beef is the same
Now Im caught in it Beefing with Game
And his image is the 'West coast Savior' Must of been the only weapon in Hand
I know Pac is in Heaven like ""damn""
But that's a small problem. Real little in fact
Fab Chill. Wouldn't put you in the middle of that
I don't need a nigga help. Nah niggas is trash
Five on one. But it ain't like one of them niggas can rap
And I got other shit to deal with like my little bro becoming a man
Gotta watch what he's becoming. He's fam
Don't know if he at the age where there's a gun in his hand
Cause he'll be done in a can. See, He's young. Understand
Little niggas too smart to end up in a building
But every nigga that I know That's in Jail is Brilliant
And they all got a story. Normally full of glory
A few Misteps. and a couple of regrets
They all tight in the mental with credentials. After all the shit they been through
Matter Fact. They all got potential
Matter Fact. We all got potential. Some of us don't use it
So having it is useless
He don't wanna be a 'Shoulda'' Coulda''Woulda'
But he didn't. Now he sent in. Bunkie asking how he get in
Now he Just it. Now he pissed in
He got loved ones but now we gotta visit 'em
Yeah, He's talented. But now its all hindering
Shit you would of gave to 'em. Now you gotta send it in
Whatever you doing young'n. Dog, It ain't fine
Without a Breathalizer, nigga, Walk a straight line
I gotta teach dude That Friends ain't Friends
And Love ain't love. No Matter how Heart shaped it is
You don't need friends The cars and Cake'll get
You need 'em when times are hard. They adjascent with
That ain't where you wanna be. And shouldn't Have Ta'
Wasn't in the before Flick. Shouldn't be in the After
Only trying to fuck you like incest
While you search like Credit Cards. For Who got ya Best interest?
And I don't wanna talk ya ear off about a whole bunch of shit I'm still learning myself
Play ya friends from far. And keep your enemies close
Cause I done been through enough for us both
(Slight Whisper)
Play ya friends from far. And keep your enemies close
Cause I done been through enough for us both

Play ya friends from far. And keep your enemies close

Extra small waist, top lookin like D's

So it's unlikely, I trick on her tryin to ball
Tattoo on her back said China Doll
Joey! Talk to 'em like Imus y'all

I'm in the 'tel with her, you just text her
You just chase her, you just sweat her
She played you out, you just let her
You just peck her, you protect her
I don't even understand them gestures
I undress her, throw her on the dresser (and)
Normally the room like like Esther
But if she act up, gotta check her
R.L. +Next+ her, that's just my regular
Et cetera, my service like Federer
The Rodger cat, now do you roger that?

Can we


How you doin tonight?
Matter fact, what you doin tonight?
If the answer's nothin
I'm hopin us two could get into somethin
So let me know what you doin tonight
Or, maybe I'm what you doin tonight
Call me up naked when she home alone
And make the tone long, now that's the phone bone
Look - I ain't gotta compliment you
Uhh, me bein me compliments you
So on the balcony or in the tub
On the plane join the Mile High Club
From the club to the bathroom stall
Whenever we'll hook up she ain't wearin no drawers
Ooh baby I likes it raw
But keep that behind closed doors, my door

The writtens I'm spittin sound like I'm fishin for a whale (uh-huh)
Of course I'm sicker, my flow off the Richter
I'm forcin niggas to get a bigger scale
I gotta excel, so I sell X
You're like Nextel, who you gon' tell next? (who?)
Can't grind off packs cause y'all watchin 'em
I ain't see a dime off rap cause y'all droppin 'em
I go hard on tracks, ain't get a buck from it
And as far as rats I hope the fucks plummet (fall)
I like to mix karate with gunplay
So all you dumb chumps get nunchucked to gun-butted

Uh, one of the last from the Garden State
That spit like he in a jungle goin hard with apes (nigga)

Comin up, used to grab the pound for a dollar
Overseas, now prefer the pound over the dollar
Fuckin with that water you get drowned somethin proper

Sober still, except for an occasional dose of pills
Show the steel, all of it 'til it's overkill
For Oprah bills I'll turn this bitch into Cloverfield! (nigga)
I understand why niggas ain't tryin to bond with me (why?)
Fresh as a fuck, e'ry day is like the prom for me
Rappers ain't fond of me, FRRUCK them, my mantra be
The game's fixed anyway - and you could ask Tim Donaghy
I'm on some all kinda weed, sleep where the piranhas be
And honestly (f'real) I'm e'rything dudes be tryin to be
I get money and haul off (now)
While they at rock bottom, the poor guys can't even fall off (Joey!)
I'm all Spartan, avoid the four sparkin

Fresh from Z the borough and Alliyah y'all
Thugs wanna act I dare y'all
Gassed off that haze and the Smirnoff
The answer to questions I hear y'all
Me and that dude don't compare naw
He's one rhyme song
While I'm Nick Cannon folks at my best when the +drumline's+ on
Beef is welcome I'll get my dudes
I'm not A. Houston I won't leave when the help come
Now wa-wa-wait just a minute
I think boo made a mistake just a minute
Two-wayin me like get her in the club
She must got me confused wit a nigga she's fuck
Cause I don't bring sand to the beach
So they don't get mad when other girls put they hands on me
If I do bring out for all the world to stare
It's cause I think she'll look better than all the girls here
Now wait, wa-wa-wait just a minute
I think dude's started to hate just a minute
He'll need a few 8-balls to fix those dropped out diamonds a few grades short

Hold up, wa-wa-wait just a minute

Hold up, wa-wa-wait just a minute
We gon do it like yeah y'all, yeah y'all

Somethin' that you might wanna hear y'all
What's with all the tough looks and the stares for?
Yeah I'm a boss so I'll always have hate
Why you playin' in the hood like you'll always have weight
Streets is fulla rats just waitin' to send you back
And we call 'em +fat man+ cause he's always wit Jake
Now wait, wa-wa-wait just a minute
I think that watch is fake just a minute
Both got Jacob's here's that ain't ya fault
Your bezel slim, mine's a lil' thicker
Diamonds in mine is just a lil' bigger
Your be's plastic mine's is all glitter
I keep it hot, but I'm like A-Rod
I'm the best but I let dude keep my spot
Now wait, wa-wa-wait just a minute
Get smacked wit the back of the 8 just a minute
Keep hearin' what dude said in the street
One elevator ride y'all are dead to beat
Yep it's me, wave to haters
Cause I'm like Arnold drop the guns and they made me Mayor
So next time they throw hate for a minute
Hold up, wa-wa-wait just a minute
Go on put ya hands high in the air
Wit that stuff that get you real high in the air
Soon as she say she gotta escape for a minute
Hold up, wa-wa-wait just a minute

I Don’t Wanna Know Freestyle,UnKnown,UnKnown,"How you with another man? How you gon' go out and kiss another man?
Lingerie on, lights out you strip for that other man (but)
But I'm a pimp, so I can't let you get the upper hand I'm like naw
Telling me you with another guy I'm like naw
Telling me he slide you the pipe I'm like naw
Cause I don't show affection while he keeps it wet still
He cops you La Perla, I take you to Wet Seal
I chill with the , that  you still don't feel different
So he must be real ill liquored but he don't dig deep with the real deal rhythm
But you lose me I hope you look real ill with him (no)
But I don't want to know where y'all go or what y'all do
Or where y'all at because then I'll be calling with the heater like, ""Where y'all at?!""
And he don't dare want that but I care come back

Somebody said they saw you
The person you were kissing wasn't me
And I would never ask you
I just kept it to myself

I don't wanna know
If your playin me, keep it on the low
Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if your creepin, please don't let it show
Oh baby, I don't wanna know

Oh baby
I think about it when I hold you
When lookin in your eyes, I can't believe
I don't need to know the truth
Baby keep it to yourself


Did he touch you better than me? (touch you better then me)
Did he watch you fall asleep? (watch you fall asleep)
Did you show him all those things, you used to do to me (do to me baby)
If your better off that way (better off that way)
There ain't more that I can say (more that I can say)
Just go on and do your thing and don't come back to me
(Stay away from me baby)

I don't wanna know where your whereabouts or how you movin
I know when you in the house or when you cruisin
It's been proven, my love you abusin
I can't understand, how a man got you choosin (yeah)
Undecided, I came and provided ma
My undivided, you came and denied it (why?)
Don't even try it, I know when you lyin (I know when you lyin)
Don't even do that, I know why you cryin (stop cryin)
I'm not applyin no pressure, just wanna let you know
That I don't wanna let you go (I don't wanna let you go)
And I don't wanna let you leave
Can't say I didn't let you breathe
Gave you extra cheese (c'mon), put you in the SUV
You wanted ice so I made you freeze
Made you hot like the West Indies (that's right)

Velvet Rope Freestyle,UnKnown,UnKnown,"The game is foul at both ends of it
There's no freedom of speech cause of this little thing that we call censorship
As if that don't narrow our content enough
We make it smaller, talking bout rims and shit
Getting jerked for the art, cause the art's now work
When you sitting start writing in penmanship
And now the radio's human, for it to fuck with
Now you gotta make friends with it
So I make some old radio crap
Since everything else on the radio's that
DJ spin this, maybe go plat
And if it don't play, they'll say he's so wack
I'm everything, controversial
Underground, gangsta rap, slash commercial
(I'm) introspective, (I'm) slash reflective
Call the shit whatever long as you get the message
Call the shit whatever long as it ain't neglected
Long as shit is respected, yeah
Wack dudes going hard to be nice
Nice dudes going hard to be wack, going hard for a plaque
Keep doing what you always did, keep getting what you always got
Joey always hot
And it may seem I ain't always On Top
But I am in more ways than I'm not
It's all twisted
Nowadays can't fail to make charts
Cause the stars made the sales now sales make the stars
Wish I could go back to the days of glory
It was all about music, less about the story
It's like a talk show, it's like one long episode of Maury
One long episode that bores me
It's like a talk show, more like a soap
Can't change the channel, can't find the remote
I call it pathetic, some find it as dope
Some call it hard, I find it all choch'
I find it to be a big screen full of smoke

What Yo Name Is?,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Fucking on the floor, how'd we get this far?
Legs over my shoulder, and im in it raw
I'mma stay inside you as I pick you up
Dripping down your thigh, bitch I lick it up
All that I remember, is I had on a tie
And that ass looked amazing, but you was acting shy
I ain't get your name, I ain't had the time
But I ain't even need it for the things I had in mind
And

We'd dip off together, I grab you
Whats weird is nobody said one thing
One last call, we know what we was on
Whats worse is I dont regret it

All I know is we'd been fucking all night
Dim lights, came twice, that ain't stoppin us
From going all night, damn lights, so right
We fuck like we know each other well
But what your name is?
And fuck who you came with
But but what your name is?
Bitch, I make you famous

Something about the look in your eyes
Will let me know you were down for whatever
And I know I could come inside
But That that will keep me around forever
But damn, it feels amazing to me!
You walk through that door
And the first thing that I saw
Was your thighs hugging my face
My mouth in places unseen
And we'll be one hour lovers
Adore the way that I fuck ya
But I hope nobody hears how you scream!

We'd dip off together, I grab you
Whats weird is nobody said one thing
One last call, we know what we was on
Whats worse is I dont regret it

All I know is we'd been fucking all night
Dim lights, came twice, that ain't stoppin us

And fuck who you came with
But but what your name is?

She said nobody ever got this pussy wetter than you did baby
I've been trying to figure out how I end up on this floor with you
And now im rolling on X, overdosing on your sex im so high I love you baby
And we'd be fucking all night
Ill be here all night with you
Roll around all night with you

All I know is we'd been fucking all night
Dim lights, came twice, that ain't stoppin us

Hate Me,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Check me out, I fell in love with the hatred
Love being hated, y'all should already know as much as I state it
Niggas ain't thinking, drugged or sedated
I could care less I give a fuck I made it
Best in the world, pull the plug on your playlist
Much that I dated, y'all cover parade with
Realest to ever do it, hate to interrupt the fake shit
If I said it I meant it, trust I don't insinuate shit
I turn a deaf ear to the feed back
You come from the bottom, I come from underneath that
Y'all hit the strip club toss a few G stacks
I invest it, and quadruple's what I see back
See I'm used to the all black ski mask
Grew to the louie duffle in elite class
Zero the speed limit I ain't going no where though, just mean they getting no where slow

Why you want to hate me? Why would you want to hate me, me?
Why you want to hate me? Why you want to hate?
Why would you want to hate? y'all can go on and hate me
Y'all can go on and hate me, me, y'all can go on and hate me
Y'all can go on and hate, why would you want to hate?

It's mental, it's all in your thoughts
If you a janitor, mop the floor like a boss
Push the ford like a porsche
Sell a ounce like a bundle
Treat your plain looking girlfriend like a model and the models gon' want you
Rock the tee like it's an exclusive fit
If she give the best head,(nigga) just act like you used to the shit
See I'm good at that, walk like your dick is that big
If you slip out make her put it back, Why you want to hate me?
(See) I'm in the club so low key that you barely know it's me
Don't even like rap, in the cars flow is tree I might jack
Butterfly both virgins I'm on it like that
Ain't the richest or the flyest, best dressed
Just the sickest and the nicest, best kept
So when they hate me it's fun, cause I wasn't even a threat till they made me one, check it


All I did was, take a small hood nobody knew about
Repped it, let the game know something new was out
Gave y'all my slang what you saying is old
Made it cool to be yourself, stop playing the role
Stood up to the label, said I'd rather have an opinion than sell my soul and be a minion
Majors gave him mad looks was a nice try, we gonna sell the same I just do it off of WiFi
When lyrics was in need around you
Slaughterhouse was born nigga meet the founder
All I did spit like a nigga from another world
Bitch was off  turned into a cover girl
Only dumb niggas hate on brilliance
Only dudes that won't last hate on resilience
I'm chilling just counting my blessings
I guess in essence I'm asking a rhetorical question",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-hate-me-lyrics
This Is For,Mood Muzik: The Worst of Joe Budden,2003,"This one's for the huh huh x2
For my own home yea
Now this one's for the streets, niggas holding blocks down for keeps
Selling their body trying to eat, yes now this is for my home
Where I lay my dome for rest, 
this is for my niggas smoking ses
(Hey) now this is for my block, running from cops trying to live
This is for my mom's shedding tears, (hey) now this one's for my niggas that have passed away gone
You better know you got to hold it down round here

This is for the streets and the hood, this for the people want to see what's good
This for the people that's down about being down and out and for my three strike niggas trying to flee on foot
For my niggas that a murk that K off or my dogs that a work that yay off
Or if you got to go to work no days off or if you ain't got a job got laid off
I'd fuck a million off rap, this if you dealing out crack or feeling out  I'm feeling you scratch
The city housing ceiling is cracked so if you boosting stealing off Racks, like fuck whatever mom's and steals cause you black
Now let's take the ghetto and go deep inside it, hoodie always trying to keep shit quiet
Keep shit private, keep dividing
They don't want America to see inside it, they don't want America to see the riots
Act a fool like when they blast a tool, like when they robbing they mobbing
Ain't no option, they be doing what they have to do
Dude's is snitching and there's narcs on the strip so they must have got a new suspicion
Dude's is tricking, cash is low so on the weekends probably got their main boo's stripping
Steak-outs, I need a way out and when I make out trust it I'm a stay out
And I'd be caked out that's a safe route, y'all can kill each other all day now
Cause I'm sick of all, from the bodegas, chinese joints, and the liquor stores
Like just get rid of it all, they only exhibit for niggas to fall
But niggas is quick to ignore, prohibit a niggas to saw
Or gripping the pistols and fours and getting you niggas in court and filling the prisons with y'all
These niggas is forgetting the system is  persistent on ditching the people
The  and the whores live with the pigeons up north, now what you petitioning for?
Etcetera, no the hood won't hold me down I stay one step ahead of ya'
And if it comes down to it I'd die for this, dude's loss they life over pettier
The muggings, the rapes, and the looting, the shooting, the danger, the rage and the fury the banger cage in the jury
They all out for me I got a mouth to feed so fuck stress my baby mama gives
Fuck stick up boys and the foes that know where my baby mama lives
I'm back in it that rented or that with the tax  stash in it
Trying to grow but I'm trapped in it nigga,  nigga
Bad tempered nigga, Blat at a nigga yea I'm pass betting nigga chill
Let me breathe, at times I get upset when I'm trying to rep
And there's always a nigga in debt and there's always a nigga to step
And there's always a nigga you met and there's always a nigga you let
Hood's filthy, verdicts in and the hood's guilty
Double edge swore, cause the hood'll kill me but the hood feels me
If you make it then put a glass up toast motherfucker, it's the oath motherfucker
It's the growth motherfucker!",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-this-is-for-lyrics

One's for the money, two's for the show
Three's for my dudes, four's for the (oh!)

Keep ya man in check, ma, control them guys
One's for the money, two's for the show
Three's for my dudes, four's for the (oh!)
My dudes play the wall and grab ya dick
And if she gets outta line the, smack that biatch

Now if he call you a 5, it ain't to say hi
It's to get you on ya back with ya legs high
He call you a ten like it's nothin' real major
He a smart dude, he settin' it up for later
If he spends time, y'all all over town hangin'
The more shit he buy you, the bigger the down payment
And if you get the house number on the spot
Then you finer than every girl he already got
Don't fall for the line, get grown in ya head
It's a lie if he hit you wit ""my phone was dead""
Or the old ""I was sleep"", them lines is so 
Y'all always fall for the ""I ain't have no signal""
If he don't answer when you block ya number
He probably got a wife and he blocks you from her
Condoms irritate him, and he wanna try raw
Chances are he's used that line before
If he breaks up with you like, right before Christmas
Then you not his main girl or you wasn't on the gift list
Couple of rules, just a couple of jewels
If he got a baby mama, don't ever make him choose (you'll lose)
On the weekends, you hardly with him
All you really wanna do is go and party with him

And if she gets outta line the, smack that biatch

Now if she call you all day, always leavin' a message
Then you pipe her better than whoever she mess with
If she's tight with e'rybody you know
Then she's prolly a hoe and e'rybody know
Up and coming model, and she goin' so hard
It's just a nice way of sayin' she got no job
If every time you call she turn off the ringer
Then you probably turned her off and she rather use her finger
She makin' excuses lately, nigga
No kids, but she gotta find a babysitter
These are lines made up from girly
She don't really wanna see you if she say she gotta wake up early
(Nah) Don't fall for the BS she try to feed ya
Cause she'll try to beat ya, she'll try to G ya
Have you heated, come back scorchin'
But you know a girl period don't come that often
Get back in the game
If she give you head, she expects that in exchange
And if she got a seed, nah, don't even bother
'Cause if y'all ever beef, she'll threaten you with the father
And shes a good trick, she won't let you hit
She knows pussy's power, wanna see what she can get
And if you think that nuttin' I'm sayin is right
Then at least know to never make a hoe a housewife, nah

Show me you know how to that girl
Like who's that girl taking over me, I'm the all as if that don't make her notice me
I don't Curr- 'bout her man, I don't Curr- if she faithfull
I only came out to see what I can Fanai-go
She got boots, Highlights she very use to
Lipgloss, Fragrance smelling like Cherry Nu-Gla
Everything that she rock she look fine in it
When she relaxing, baby is air clining it
I got it bad for diva, I holla back
But if she holla back, is proud as her Rep
Now, can we get it, poppin', Boo
Cuz you watching me, but I'm watching you

Oooh that girl, she's on the scene
She be my gangsta
She be my Lean
Oooh that girl, she's in the crowd
I see her looking, she wanna get down

Now things look a little more lively
I'm starting to think she really likes me
Her body is starting to hipnotize me
I'm 'bout to forget I got a wifey
Look how she clings to me, I'm picturing her doing bad things to me
Like up all ya is going down
Oh, Oh yo she's going down
But for real, for real, on the really real
You ain't got to go yet, don't be silly could chill
Hope later on if she feeling me still, I'm like ""What's really good, What's really the deal""
If you looking for that perfect man to hold you down ma
Then *sip* this nigga, slow it down ma
But holla if you need a ride back boo
Or just for the record, know that I'm that Nucca



Are you the type to give it up when you sleep with the rest
Or the type that like this and say it's deeper than sex
I know, You got a 2-way I need that contact
Let's hit the dace floor I need that contact
Ma, I got big plans for us
She's a freak, she's skandalous
Cuz the blue jeans I see Vicky Inprints
We can puff off like Nikki Infrants
Cuz I like how you do that, damn
Pretty lady gone do that dance
I got my fresh Nike's, Full pockets, and a crisp white Tee
Understand I'm feeling good 'bout me
By now, who's that, my side, all night
And no I'm not drunk, but I'm high off life
I tried to talk, but she ate me, dude
Cuz she big on me, like I'm big on... (Big on...)

Now wait a damn minute I done made you listen
I been in the Lamb sittin you watchin you Can’t miss it
Enjoyin all the fruits of my drive and my ambition
Man I gotta tell ya this a hell of a transition
If you ain’t got bands sittin then we understand different
Walk in the club showin her love you can hand pick her
Shaped like a mannequin hey what’s your name n****
Shorty wanna stay with me must think that I’ll stay with her
For the project next I’m thinking project sex
The crib is Project X shes from the products from that
She said “I hate when you treat me like an object in bed”
Bitch what you logically expect I got the top off a text
Now that’s a body in uh army the zombie and I kindly
Wanna party with Kehlani we at a party with Kehlani
But as soon as the flight touch down got one night in this town
How you think you got a right to the crown I Get Around

The Underground just don’t stop for hoes I get around
Closest thing round to 2pacalypse Now I get around
Ridin round with the mac and the pound I get around
Closest thing round to 2pacalypse Now I get around

I’m back on Def Jam again
You niggas keep getting def and I just yam again y’all see how I’m handlin
New Benz big boy coupe seat reclining tho
White pipin on black seats blastin domino
I pull up honk that horn she know its time to go
She take long windows down I’m screamin vamanos
Lately I been reeling with hate all kind of trolls
I’m just tryna stack this bread feel the homonym
Off that my main point back to rhyming tho
Bitches get beside themselves like watching Quantico
And then fools get wet from the tool
Playing superhero here might lead to a deadpool
Surrounded by chump niggas I always hated you niggas
I’m feeling like Trump niggas I’m right in the trunk niggas
The boys got you raising the bar won’t jump with ya
They tailored to be bad in the ring chump niggas
I don’t engage warring with words tongue slicker
I’m probably only aloud because I got to the trunk quicker
I’m not under ashamed Hunger Games but when niggas was full
Joey feel jack hip to the bull
I never sleep shit I get nightmares in the worst way
They say I’m missing screws wasn’t there in the first place
But when that flight touch down got one night in this town
They treat me like a knight in this town I get around

And you’ll be looking for something to do
She’ll be looking for somewhere to go
Sooner or later this club gon’ close
I’m the nigga you gon wanna see
Time the nigga you gon’ wanna know
Look, face is incredible, amazing
Had to notice as I passed on the way in
Gave her, she crashed where I was staying
I then had to tell her, relax we ain't dating
Can’t get the hotel suite with the fire place
Without Serena legs and the Mya waist
Good hair and skin like she should model more
Drunk off of shots so what would I buy the bottle for
In a Jaguar, she a couger only came her for the hookahs
Still a nigga brought the ruger
He ain't got no idea that I’m surrounded by them shooters
Never know if I’ma have to treat ‘em like he an intruder
Now back to the shawty though, she say it’s natural
Lipo scarred but its covered by a tattoo
Bounced on the girlfriend, they ain't even mad at you
Wouldn't even matter though, yeah I like that attitude

Now cut the lights down just a little lower
Just a little lower
Just a little lower
Just a little lower
Grab her by the thigh and get her to come closer
Let her feel a gun size in the holster
Then fill her glass to the top she too sober
Cut the lights down just a little lower
Then hit the corner, something I gotta show ya

Ride so clean where the fuck is my roof
Somebody girl gon gettin’ fucked in my coupe
No chain drippin’ lets give ‘em the Cartier
Ride up to the club we brings the party here
Where them hoes at, try to fuck something
New toya, bout to buck something
Know the haters out, gotta tuck something
Can't get the gun in the club I gotta cut something
Only pretty girls, no duck hunting
It’s that time of the whaat? Bitch suck something
Straight shots, peach Ciroc and I’m off
Before you know it, the party be in the house
Get up on that, get up in that
Open wide girl, get ya chin back
My type of bitch yeah, where you been at
Lights way too bright you gotta dim that

Shape, she should be on a poster
She get it in, a little jack, a little soda
And I’ll take it from the pole to the sofa
Send her back out with her pussy all re-upholstered
Shawty bad though, I’m talking dumb fined
All I need to do is hit it one time
Bet I be the nigga she gon wanna confined
Try to bring the cuffs out, now I’m feeling confined
I ain't chase her, other niggas fought hard
You thinks its scarier, marry her, courtyard
Me I beat it up, take the assault charge
Marks all over her body like a report card
I need a witness, come and look at all of that
Say she been around, I ignore pass
My bread is my bread I won't support her ass
All that mean is theres no rings in the forecast

And the beat go
Im the dopest nigga in the hood (x3)
Im the dopest nigga
Look...

The game don’t need changing
It just need to be remodeled or renovated
Yeah it need to be renovated
Said it twice, felt I had to reiterate it
You can’t rap, bump Joe; I can demonstrate it
Since I made it, changed my whole outlook on music
If it don’t make sense don’t make it
With no resources, options eliminated
Still look at all the income I generated
I've been degraded, now I’m imitated
But I’m too real, there’s no show, you can’t syndicate it
I know why they out there tryna mimic greatness
Cause when they look in the mirror they get intimidated
And that’s real appalling
They tried to blackball me I went and got a deal through Spaulding
Don’t play with a vet, place bets I’m fly
You Farve, Brett just get out the way of a Jet
Tee chucks is mean, like my deluxe with a beam
Get you clipped from the touch of a screen
If it ain’t about a buck or a C.R.E.A.M
Then my mind get Christina Milian
Dog fuck your Dream, go ahead oust yourself
Go to the top of the Empire State and Ron Browz yourself
Got the brain of genius, lie like a crooks mouth
Drive like a dope boy, eyes of a lookout
Great accountant, everythings off the books now
Temper of a shooter, no prints on the Ruger
And they’ll put it on my tab
And they’ll treat you like a new outfit
They’ll fold you and put you in a bag, dag
Hit the mall hard, ball hard, spending more yards
I’m a Nordstrom’s second floor star
Check the score card, homies hate that I ball hog
But can’t Street Fight with Balrog
From store robber to for sure copper
With a model, a jaw dropper, drawl dropper
And I let her walk in first to make sure I got her
Cause y’all won’t even get a hello when y’all stop her
Between old timers, and those minors
There’s no rhymes, but to they credit they need co-signers
Done beefin’, won’t respond to nobody
That’s a lie, just won’t respond to a nobody
See I’m just tryna pave the way
Get away from my ways, or put a new play on stage
Cause I used to cook up on a day to day
Put it in a pot, this is way before Rachel Ray
In a fashion, But I ain’t on the ‘Swagger’ van
Gave half a damn, when my aunt dated Dapper Dan
But If I see jewels (Juelz) on a dull lame
I’ma take his face off so he can rep the Skull Gang
Catch me when I’m flaring up
And I’ma make sure that when it All Falls Down, you staring up
Ain’t got a real chance
Your swag is like Real and Chance
I need about a few Mill in advance
I grind to earn me a bag of soft money
Pad and loft money, Bernie Madoff money
To see how a few dudes hate
I make more than a yearly income off my Youtube page
I think the haters love him, fans hate him
Chicks mad at his chicks ass, they can’t date him
Why carry tools, get mad at fools
And in New York they just a zero
Call 'em Larry Hughes
It’s the best rapper in the world wide web
And you can tell the world I said
Take off the wide web and it still applies
Sad part is I’m still on the rise

Niggas Done Started Something Freestyle,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Can't clone these thoughts
They tryna tear down the homie fort
It's a waste of time I stay on my grind, I'm Tony Hawk
Easy with the hate, let a nigga see a mill first
I ain't into local beef, get a deal first
I bubble these toys, the trouble me boy
But I won't fall off, I ain't Trouble T Roy
Fucker -- don't make me put the thing to your bill
Cause dog you like wrestling, I used to think you was real
Dog, I used to just chill in the hood with no stardom
Now I'm killing the kids, I suffer from postpartum
Don't understand how you cowards be eating
It's time to cough it back up, son it's allergy season
For real, too petty, sunny I move deadly
The jewels heavy, pearl's blue it's like the new Pepsi
And if I'm mad witcha, pull the gat quicker
That'll ruin your Grey Goose and I don't mean bad liquor
The underdog, son I move too greasy
They treat me like De La Hoya, thought dude could beat me
Nah -- I lay low in the coupe when I ride nigga
With a fly stripper and it's not cause I'm a nice tipper
Icy hot, I'm just getting my wealth
The baby's .45, we both contradicting ourselves
They probably more upset
See me ride by with Ortiz Claudette in a beach Corvette
If it's a problem son tell me now
Have band-aids over your face, you overdoing Nelly's style
Haters wanna get their click-clack on
If you don't like my music, it's alright brother skip that song

I wanna see how many niggas will rep
When I scream out Jersey, I ain't talking about Mitchell & Ness
I'm talking about getting respect
I'm talking about taking one cig out the pack and dippin the rest
You don't really want a problem with me
I hit your body with three and have you shaking like Mohammad Ali
Now you know you done started something
We three niggas from the hood, so you better bring your hawk or something
Can't hustle so you better get a job or something
I rather hit the block,  Jaws or something
Hitchcock, Ransom, and we involving Buddens
So if you got beef forget it because dog it's nothin
I walk around with the vest and the shotty
If I get locked up, they'll put me in the same section as Gotti
Come on dog you ain't catching a body
If I jumped in your arms you probably still couldn't catch you a body
Ain't a nigga tryna son Ran, cause that's dumb plan
When the gun blam, I give your body a sun tan, man

First of all, don't make me have to murder y'all
Second of all, don't make me put this weapon to y'all
Third of all, I never even heard of y'all
Last of y'all, don't make me have to blast for y'all
Cause if you sleep I'm a blaze ya, keep heat by my pager
If streets was my major, I would pass it all
I'm MVP of streets before I pass the ball
Shut down the game so I'm the last to ball
I laugh at y'all, talking about your cash and cars
Hitch ridiculous, spit acid bars
That'll melt your face, playa I'll belt your face
With my name on a buckle that'll welt your face
You the type to take the stand and help the case
Even your moms disowned you, you a felt disgrace
Hitchcock's a bastard case, that'll blast your face
Black niggas talking religious like Pastor Ma$e

Get shot like New York, niggas get robbed
Get got like New York, but they don't make the news
'Cause it's not New York
Hope you heard me, boy, look, I'm from Jersey, boy
Where it's still half off that Hershey, boy
I was driving, shotgun was Ike when that faggot on the bike
Rode by and tried to murk me boy
But chill, here's the head crack, I'm an O.G., I don't wet that
If you know me then you know it's get back, you nah mean?
The nah mean is tools gon' flare
In a society if you nobody then actually who's gonna care?
They won't call your next of kin, I'll make your family aware
And the whole hood is dipped up so having sanity's rare
I'm from where embalming fluid ain't stop yet and city hall's primary project
Is knocking down the projects, they ain't finished that yet
See, I'm from carjack central, niggas'll go in your ride
While you pick up the Jersey Journal, ""Damn, so and so died""
I'm from where the dope game is bad, so every hustler can't hustle
Tryna hustle them a rapper slash muscle them a rapper
They can find them a young nigga with a few bars to say
'Cause nigga, rap's the new coke, wet, weed, and yay
I'm from where  had it locked 'til dude had him shot
For everybody to see and everybody was relieved
I'm from where the blocks is dark, so walk the turf with ya gun cocked
And the hospitals will fuck you up worse than a gunshot
From where screws is loose, gunpoint dudes strip nude
And that ain't even half of New Jeruve, nigga

O-oh, o-oh
Stack Bundles!
Riot Squad!

From the last stop on the A train where the youngin let his thang bang
We shoulda left the two 
Where the skies is gray 'cause no stars around
 was the last star around
Home  in the street
40 niggas  41st side piece
Where Edgeman, Raw P, and Redford 
So get your shit  there's no gettin' it back (Nah)
We're from where bitch niggas go to jail and turn thug, and (What else?)
Crip niggas go to jail and turn Blood, and (What else?)
Niggas come home, flip a lil weed
End up with barbershops and music stores with CD's
From where niggas on 17th was gettin' it 
And they own workers left them uncomfortably
From where they argue 'bout whose fuckin' whose broad, and who's drivin' what cars
And niggas hatin' like he got that from insurance 
Where old heads was gettin' it, but kept gettin' robbed
So they wanted out the game and converted to God
Where niggas play the corners 'til they pecks is done
And out-of-towners come to blam blam the cannons and run
From the other side where Queen's niggas don't come through much (Nah)
The record exec's wouldn't sign us, said we'd done too much
So they ran over to Brooklyn and thought them dudes was to trust
I don't know what the fuck they thought, them niggas look, sound just like us
From where the streets get the best of you (Bruh), the beef's inevitable (Bruh)
When you come through half price, 
From where the soldiers fall and thugs we are all

I just turn their song off and think 'sticks and stones'
Click the chrome, don't pass that to me
Unless you're trynna make Joe the next Cassidy
I'mma addict, I don't cop one, I cop three
And females, I don't stop them, they stop me
And I don't go to parties for the music, the drink, or the dance
I go to watch them watch me
With no watch b, just my regular shit on
T-shirt, rubberband telling me 'LiveStrong'
R&B'd out, bumpin' Ideal 'Get Gone'

See I walk with a lean, got a mean diddy bop on me
Niggas know I keep a lil' bit of guap on me
I could buy this bar out but I'm not homie
Cause niggas know I keep a lil' bit of guap on me
I'mma call you right back, I got the cops on me
A black man with a lil' bit of guap on me
Stash box, I need something to pop on me
You know I keep that chopper and that guap on me

I'ma gambler
So I pull up in that CLS looking like a Carolina Panther
Philly Eagle on me to avoid the yank
Cops cuff my jackets like a New Orleans Saint
And the boys think something is sweet, I'm Lance Armstrong
Keep getting accused of something I beat
See me in the strip club looking for something to skeet
While watching you trynna wife something I beat
Just see how that guap get 'em, I got lots to give 'em
But not you, slide off boo, I'm not tippin'
I kept it real, told her 'I don't like how you're moving'
She gave me the finger, said 'I don't like your music'
I'm on my grind though I hate the action
And insomnia gave me a delayed reaction
I'm on a money hunt, can't take distractions
And these Os'll add up once I chase Manhattan


It's almost like I'm walking a tight wire
You can't con a con or lie to a liar
Look here, I'll fire
Just say what I feel like I'm Kanye live standing next to Mike Myers

The Pump,Mood Muzik: The Worst of Joe Budden,2003,"And he still got Jerz on his back
Two-oh-one
Nine-seven-three-nine-oh-eight

Hold up
 just spittin' that new school
And I ain't changin' the game, I'm just givin' it new rules
Straight from Jerz, it's that kid
And the whole hood was hype about ya album 'til we heard that shit, yup
Stay in ya lane, y'all fold, that's plain
As paper, nah, it's paper plane, nah, we ain't the same
Play Ashton, and punk me losers
And I'll dot ya face up, now you Punky Brewster
Light-years ahead and beyond, scratch that
'Cause I'm light-years ahead of my comp, scratch that
It'll take 'em like 'yeah', light-years to comp
And even that right there's a comp, now think about it
Niggas got lip, but it ain't no problem
I'll get clips that look like it ain't no bottom
Dudes run around like a heartless 
'Til I go and get the Maggy, not Marge's daughter
Niggas ain't nice, y'all are garbage all year
And I'm done with this game, here's a cartridge for ya
See him in a hoop, boys blowing ears all hard
Two forty's on his lap, not the sports bar
Industry is , Interscope's rockin'
Warner is now Def Jam and Def Jam's Arista
Speakin of, try to jerk me, well
Come back a buck fifty, not first week sales, nigga
Is this what you want?
Guys and ya metaphors, I'm tired of metaphors
Rummaged through your mixtape, I said 'em all
So as far as these new rappes? I bred 'em all
Gave 'em style to run wit', but now it's done wit'
That sounds old Joe
If niggas can't tell that I'm the best then they hatin', tryna clown ol' Joe
Or they PC prolly download slow, but
Keep talkin' 'til a John Doe spot 'em
Or you hit a nigga with the long nose like Blossom
Iron ain't a thing, I'm always by myself
Never no security, and I ain't in a gang
Know the bloods, know the crips, vice lords, and latin kings
Respect they theme, but I know blue and red make green
And I'm about a buck, I don't give a fuck
I'll beat Remy in battle, all you bitches with luck
Fucks, I got that ignorant shit you like
But Clue keep censoring the shit do right
Top of the gun slide, recline and revolve 'em
 and you'll have ninety-nine problems too
Truce? Wanna hit me on the cell, I'm T-Mo'
Or sleep with the fishes, you can help find Nemo
It's armies on the strip, and it's wars on the streets
So cop some'in' that help you be all you can be
Ya heard?

This will be my saving grace, that somewhere in the human race, there's a girl who can replace you - just a simple cut and paste - then I see your face... Where will I ever find another girl like you?

Every night I contemplate, the love you handed me was fake, if I can't bend I might just break - you just might be my last mistake, still I'm gonna take - a chance and try to find another girl like you
And I want her to be, a little kinder too, I just want her to be, - a little less like you!
I must admit, that I've been confused, and its gonna take some time to shake these blues - and step into the story where anything goes, it's always been this way, I suppose. Hoping I'm doing it right, I'll take my bows and bask in the light of the unknown

Yo
My struggle's a little different, y'all niggas was sellin', I was sniffin'
Psyche, rewind it, I'm just kiddin'
I was hangin' with old cats, tryna put my bid in
Same safe you was stackin' in, I was tryna get in
Y'all was fuckin' with pigeons (Nah)
I was on Malcolm X, lookin' for a jar for my cig to get dipped in
Was still spittin' before the video vixens
Around the time Ewing had got dunked on by Pippen
Niggas was still pitchin'
I was stealin' money from my moms anytime she left her purse in the kitchen (That was fucked up)
Guzzlin' a fifth and I was high as a fuck
OD'n on Visine, so my eyes wouldn't glisten
Moms still bitchin', she thought I knew better
But I didn't, she tried to talk to 'em, wouldn't listen
It's almost like somethin' inside of me kept itchin'
I thought the streets loved me, nah, who was I kiddin'?
God lookin' like the devil (Oh), sendin' me to the pawn shop
Anytime I found shit that looked like metal
I dropped outta school, nah, not to be cool
I was sittin' there bored, thought all y'all was fools
Fuck I wanna read up on 
Romeo and Juliet
?
Way back, I ain't even have my first toolie yet
Angie ain't even make that knife go through me yet (Talk to 'em)
Matter fact, I ain't even smoke my first bollie yet
Tried to have it wrapped, but things wasn't a doobie yet
It was comin' for me, but nah, it ain't subdue me yet

Young niggas, know I used to be a young nigga
I used to pop off to prove I ain't the one, nigga
B and E's, stick ups and dirty guns niggas
This before I finally had my little young nigga
Young niggas, God keep me from these young niggas
Not the smart ones, Lord, just the dumb niggas
Might have me thinkin' I'm still one of them niggas
Shit changed from when I used to be a young nigga

Yo
Ayo, my first time locked up I was a child
Met up with mad niggas I ain't seen in a while (Yeah)
And it wasn't bad bein' locked in with them (But)
But couldn't fathom lockin' in at 10, like fuck readin' a book
Sat on my bunk, mad time to get my thoughts straight
One month, one shower, still without a court date
Just bags of nicotine, rollin' paper
I did pull ups, push ups, how the fuck'd I get here?
War stories, you hear a lot of shit here
Great place to visit, but nah, don't wanna live here
Nah, gotta get my mind in a new place
Grimy ass niggas stealin' my socks and toothpaste
Can't ever remember feelin' such neglect
But snakes get snaked (Dog), what the fuck'd I expect?
I thought if anything I had earned niggas respect
But niggas hung up soon as they heard ""Collect""
Had my mag with the tits out
O.G.s' said to me the streets don't love you, they'll be there when you get out
Bunch of the same people, stealin' the same space
A few of 'em'll die, a few will take your place
I prayed to God that I never catch another case
'Cause CO's just treat us like we rats in a maze
You wonder why Joey always hype and smilin' (Why?)
I was this close to Rikers Island
Was bein' on Rikers, wilin' (Wilin')
I done been through way worse shit than havin' a few gripes about my album (C'mon)

Not the smart ones, Lord, just the dumb niggas
Might have me thinkin' I'm still one of them niggas
Shit changed from when I used to be a young nigga

For real
God keep me from these little young niggas, man
'Cause I'll fuck around and get a bid
Make me somethin' stupid as shit
Made me resort to bein—

See. (whistles)
You know it's not beef when a n*gga's whistling
This is just family bullshit
So we going to get into this shit real quick
I don't want to spend too much time on this shit
But real quick - ayy n*gga don't cut me off
Turn back up in the headphones
Real quick, I listened to the shit
I heard the little slick shit about, you know, you protecting my life and all this shit
That shit sound good on a record
Sound good on a record
I'll believe it when I'm dead, n*gga

First the A-Team break up, now every day I wake up
A n*gga got a problem with Joe
A coward n*gga don't like you 'cause his whole style recycled
And nobody wanna hear that flow
Listen, I mean this is how you know a n*gga looking for glory
Got my phone number, any problems, coulda called me
Heard the Big Brother shit, honestly, it bored me
How it go again? Here n*ggas, the real story
I met you and Hitch, had a couple of dope punchlines
Y'all was from the hood, ain't want them to be unsigned
Said I'd intervene, long as n*ggas stayed faithful
And the Envys, Clues, Big Mikes wouldn't play you
They said y'all was garbage, I said y'all was hotness
Did a whole tape with y'all and Nelly Nel dropped it
Got a little buzz gave n*ggas a little fame
Schooled n*ggas to the game, I gave n*ggas they name
No paperwork, stepped to y'all, ""what y'all wanna do?""
Was supposed to sign to me, y'all signed to Clue
I'm like ""y'all signed to WHO?"" you know a n*gga through
The harsh reality of all that is I was used
Then y'all two split. Can't front, I disagreed
I only put y'all together to make history
Feelings to the side we'll do the track together
We still alive dog, let's do it for Stack together
You see, I could care less about your beef with Hitch
I care about our well being, features, hits
So I'll tell you like I told your manager, kid
Just being real hoping you can handle the shit
Fuck how your Glock pop off, how your flock not soft
Gettin nowhere fast being a Lox knock off
I'll clear your mental
You signed to a n*gga on radio all week and he barely spin you
Like every bar about some shit, he rarely been through
Yeah you a gorilla and you looking for toasters
It's no wonder he ain't getting no bookings for shows
'Cause your fans is like mine dog, looking for growth
I mean always the same shit, whole image tainted
Now he wanna chase the south, all on Wayne's dick
Your fiends is invisible, they never took a hit
How you Duffle Bag Ran and you never took a trip?
Dogs, let's kick it
Kick any freestyle where you rip shit, I got you more buzz off my snippet
So keep going with your Jersey City war stories
You'll sell records on Ocean, maybe 440
I'm on my guard 'cause it could get drastic
Your tapes bang like hardwood, they not classics
It's me, I'll always want you to get a million
Same n*gga that told you to start spittin with feeling
You started your switch from your songs about water
Part of the reason now every song's about your daughter
I'm taking it light on you, I didn't wanna torch ya
The nerve of this young boy gettin out of order
Look, it's one king. How I'm under you?
Go check hiphopgame, you'll always be number 2
I'm like ""Ran comin at duke? the man got heart though""
Fuck me, worry 'bout Sam Scarfo
Serious Jones, Meedah, Bralick
It's too much history with me ock stop it
Or go keep being a murderer duke
I'm in the meetings, A&R's never heard of the dude
I'm just saying, the shit's looking like it's all promo
They put the battery in your back, it's all homo
Your own team know you couldn't see me on your best day
If you was on Diddy's album, still wouldn't press play
The shit's childish, y'all abort its slaughter
Never burn a bridge when you gotta cross the water
See if I reach Fab's level and you reach mine
Everyone'll be okay, we'll be fine
But you wanna go and put shit all in a rhyme
Build a little buzz, maybe get a little shine
The JC disease, you've been bit by the hate germ
Comin' the wrong way dog, I ain't your tapeworm
The whole hood'll hear sirens for the man
I take the shit as you admiring, you a fan
If it's violence understand
I'll drive down Montgomery playing Anthony Hopkins in Silence of The Lamb
Look, instead of wasting energy on some next shit
Lock in the studio n*gga and make a record
Do something constructive, start your career
I'll meet you at the top and we can argue there
I'm just sayin",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-heart-of-the-city-ransom-diss-lyrics
Cursed,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Ayo, I sold rocks, cause I love the rush of adrenaline
Pick locks, cause I couldn't go without Benjamin's
Lick shots, to keep my enemies from entering
Fuck with cops, but without the badge and gun, they feminine
Stay a step ahead of these niggas, leave 'em waiting
You think that you got a plot that I never heard? you mistaken
It's getting got, if I see that's it's there for the taken
I'm cursed, risking it all willing to slap box with Satan

Ghetto harmony, judges change hands like local pharmacies
Blazing  with my armory, no lie, real nigga loca
Snatch the face-off like John Travolta
Ain't nothing worse than a con with a holster
Shoot-outs is mandatory, I got made niggas to act satanic for me
Family to panic for me, enemies that plan to off me
And friends get cut because they ran before me
Therapists'd take their time out, he's tryin' understand my story
Niggas' be rolling deep, guzzle casket cream
Before we car jack or lamp in a stolen Jeep
Coalition do the same, before I came apart and knew the game
Now I laugh at the Jake's on the scanner, they don't know who to blame
They think demonic ebonic's is how we translate
Filled with a mans, hate, one thing authorities just can't take
Do what I have to, contraband, following my niggas travels
We watch each others back, never snitch, ignore the gamble

Ayo, I sold rocks, cause I love the rush of adrenaline
Pick locks, cause I couldn't go without Benjamin's
Lick shots, to keep my enemies from entering
Fuck with cops, but without the badge and gun, they feminine
Stay a step ahead of these niggas, leave 'em waiting
You think that you got a plot that I never heard? you mistaken
It's getting got, if I see that's it's there for the taken
I'm cursed, risking it all willing to slap box with Satan

Have you ever made a killer bleed?
Attacking nigga's a gorilla speeds?
Eyes are watching, tell the customer to make the deal and leave
I'm bound to erupt with my temper
Hold it back, I'm tired of fucking with public defenders
That's word to Jesus, me and the judge just made a 60 day truce
I told him I wasn't the one carrying the tre-duce
Impressed with my demeanor he made the charge a misdemeanor
Even those I failed the breathalyzer  drunk upon 
Had  hide the product, in her shoes, blue suits, steady pushing my luck
I gotta choose, should I bounce to nigga  or continue to bomb through?
My mind is faring away from the norm like Tom Cruise
Father say, say what you mean, and mean what you say
Plus when you going after yours crush anything in your way
Remain 'laxed, feeling like the whole world hates me
How long will it be before the cremate me, know I seem crazy
But check it, crooks can be deceiving like looks, didn't do it, but I'm feeding the jooks
Put down your gat so we can both act tough
Know my limits, keep my calm before I walk off in shackles and black cuffs
Young nigga's pushing explorers, that handle a biscuit, gamble for business
Train of thought, cannibalistic, bullet wounds and bodies over time, they get deeper than the grim reaper
Go searching to find all of the cheaters
Check,  parents having sex, it's apparent that I'm vexed
Maybe they should intense my therapy, want my truest to know
I'm one of the realest nigga's that you'll ever meet
Wounded deep in the heart, just me and my razor blade when I was sleeping in parks
Hoping they can weave through the dark
I went from stealing ten-speeds to open-mics for all the emcees
Riding the M3s, coalition getting the benji's

Ayo, I sold rocks, cause I love the rush of adrenaline
Pick locks, cause I couldn't go without Benjamin's
Lick shots, to keep my enemies from entering
Fuck with cops, but without the badge and gun, they feminine
Stay a step ahead of these niggas, leave 'em waiting
You think that you got a plot that I never heard? you mistaken
It's getting got, if I see that's it's there for the taken
I'm cursed, risking it all willing to slap box with Satan",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-cursed-lyrics
Let’s Get It (Freestyle),Hev E. Components #3,UnKnown,"Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
Yeah, you thought I was playing
Let's go!
Fuck you and suck my dick you rat bastards!

Who's the nigga in the sweatsuit and Air Force 1's?
Ain't worried 'bout beef, I got air force guns
A silent snub, I can hear your guns
I'm shootin' at dumb dumbs, y'all shootin' with dumb dumbs
Major league, all my mans braggin' now
Because everybody's on the bandwagon now
See us pullin' the Benz's and Porches out
For fun we pop the hood, let the horses out
The Bacardi dark, y'all copy art (Uh-huh)
And when the shotty spark it pierces body parts
Look, I keep bitches 
Clowns got a lil' lip in their rim, think they deep dishes
Wanna be real, nigga, never touch steel, nigga
Local cat screaming that he got a deal, nigga
Your cake lil', nigga, can't pay the bills, nigga
Steady playin' a demo that I don't feel, nigga
It's all hearsay, he's signed but he's independent
No promotion, no radio airplay
The jewels that I put on be gray
While you bummin' every week, talkin' 'bout it's laundry day
And a lot of rappers out can't rap worse shit
On a Neptunes track spittin' wack Earth shit
Know nuttin' 'bout rap if you think Joe Budden can't rap
Def Jam wasn't fuckin' wit' that",https://genius.com/Joe-budden-lets-get-it-freestyle-lyrics

Don't wanna go to the movies or take ya to Houston's
But every time I say that, a chick gets disgusted
You not my girl, I can't be wit' you in public
I ain't tryin' to put quality time in
And I don't care if we got anything in common
If you don't feel that way, then leave the house then (but)
I can't kiss you ma, don't know where ya mouth been
It's no , just wanna know if she's jumping off the building
No bungee cord
But she'd rather not jump off just to save face (but)
She know I ain't call her hear just to play spades (No)
Ugly broads here's why we ain't bone yet (cause)
You're not cute but got a great voice for phone sex (Ahh)
Since we met, I been trying to get them jeans off
What you think I go to Lobby or Eugene's for? (Or)
Discotech and chauff'
Find one that maybe give good neck and go
Lookin' for a jumpoff to take into the club
Cause the strip joint don't do nothin' but make you wanna fuck
And ma, I'm not trying to wife you
Don't wanna get to know you, I ain't trynna like you
Or get in your mind, (Just) just asking for two minutes of your time
(And) And you ain't even gotta be a dime
What's it really gonna be?
Don't make me call up one of my ex-girlfriends that I don't really wanna see
All cause I'm horny then after I'm hittin' that
Cause she just gone think that we really getting back (but)
You can meet me at  or the 
And if you wanna jump, all you gotta do is say so
I'm a OG so I know how these hoes do
I don't know your name ma, I'm not supposed to
