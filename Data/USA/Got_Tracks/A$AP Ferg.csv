A Hundred Million Roses,A$AP,2012,"Uh, when I die bring a hundred million roses
Pretty bad bitches making love to my posters

In my Cartiers, two lugged teeth
Threw ice in it, so I feel the breeze
Two thug bitches, thinkin about them G's
Who love the hood, they'll never leave
Four model bitches stay popping E
On that booger sugar, rolling up the trees
Spit hella game in her skinny frame
Versace frames, and her dirty bangs
She fuck her friends, then fuck my friends
This story go, it will never end, (it will never end)
It, it, it will never end
And if I die before I wake, I pray that A$AP will be great
My mama good and my girl be late
So there will be another me and the world be straight
Damn that nigga did his thang, he took over and changed the game
His silk shirt, Versace frames, his fly ass bitches
His tight ass jeans, his dirty Benz, his Cuban links
His big ass smile, his eyes is chinked
His brown ass skin, he was looking gold
He really lived, God bless his soul

When I die bring a hundred million roses
Pretty bad bitches making love to my posters
Roses, bring a hundred million roses
Roses, roses, bring a hundred million roses

Fergie, Fergie ?

Uh, tell that bitch that I'm Fergie Ferg
Remind her I'm rich but never flip a bird
Yes a nigga street, just like the curb
Young Bari high, fucking with the herd
Rest in peace to Selena
I listen to you sing when I'm rolling the weed up
Mix the Cristal with Tequila
Might fuck your bitch but I don't wanna to kill her
I beat that bitch, flash backs to Tina
I feel like Ike when I'm on the mic
And my Diet Butcher, Vera Wang
Vera Wang slang bitches for their brain
And 40 ounce bounce, thug bitches with the fangs
Who fill the block up with cocaine

When I die bring a hundred million roses
Pretty bad bitches making love to my posters
Roses, bring a hundred million roses
Roses, roses, bring a hundred million roses",https://genius.com/A-ap-ferg-a-hundred-million-roses-lyrics

He work hard, he put in work
He put in work, got these niggas going bezerk
Riding music, I see you riding to it
Bang 'em over the head, nigga that for talking foolish
Nigga, work hard, put in work
Put in work, got these niggas going berserk",https://genius.com/A-ap-ferg-work-lyrics

Choppas on Deck,Lord$ Never Worry,2012,"Medusa faces turn me into stone
Versace killers and Raf murdering Dior Hommes
My skinny niggas fuckin' bring the chrome
The only thing I'm killin' is a microphone
Now let my little niggas take you home
One straight to that dome
Betta ring the alarm, Fergy's home
Ever taste the chrome? Way far from a silver spoon
Sing your lullabies, watch your mother and your brother cry
Fuck your sister brains, causin' mental homicide
Motherfuck' your life, fuck your family nigga, fuck your wife
I be down for life (A$AAAP), my brothers for life
Big money, talk to me knots
Talk to me nice or don't talk to me at all
Grippin' that Mack now he grippin' the floor
Ratatatat—let it split through your jaw
Laid on your back, whisperin' Lord, bet he couldn't see his death
Berettas under the leather he couldn't see this Tec
Teflon vest for those who test
A bunch of niggas gettin' throwed call me Jazzy Jeff

Invite 'em in water like formula 50
I'm pipin' your daughter, muhfucker come get me
One clip to that brain, gone in a jiffy
I'm poppin' your dame, cum on the titties
Beef lo mein, all in her shrimpy
Oodles and noodles, hangin' out his fitted
Somebody done died, who knows who done did it?
Somebody gon' ride, bang em with the Smith and
Nines men in black, I will Will Smith him
Semi-automat', brattttt it would lift him
Preacher gon' sang, momma gon' listen
He was on that bullshit, Jordan or Pippen
So I had to pull shit, feeling so tempted
Rocks on his socks, Shawshank Redemption
Somebody gon' die, who knows who done did it?

Death B4 A Million,UnKnown,2012,"Don't wish me death before I see a million
Before I see these hoes and I'm up there tell my mom that I lived it
Before they dunk a flow, motherfuckers wanna talk but think they live it, no
I be ballin' stuck up in this pivot, where you trying to go?
Stuck up in this lavish living
Fucking with ghetto hoes truth be told it's money over bitches
Gotta get this dough I'm alone in this cold world
Let's go home cause we grown girl, let's get it on

Being broke this shit ain't fucking pleasant
My daddy showed me lots of money at the age of 7
Before he went to heaven
Papa knew I'd be this way
Fucking with different bitches
To bad he couldn't see the day
But he still watching over me
The devil try to take my wings
Bounce him over the head if he stand before me, shit
I floss with nothing but the real Gs, only real niggas
Introduced me to Supreme team, yeah them real killers
And I layed a couple niggas down for the real figures
I was born in this shit thats why I claim to be the realest nigga
Choppin' it up with all of the thugs
Mobbin' it up with all of the bloods
Bicin' it up with all of the homies
Sippin' it up with all the broads
How many times I've dreamed of cars
Dreams of me living large
Big stars like El Debarge
Money not a thing I'm grinding hard
Lord,.. deliver me my wishes please
I've been eating all this time can y'all niggas do the dishes, please

Don't wish me death before I see a million
Before I see these hoes and I'm up there tell my mom that I lived it
Before they dunk a flow, motherfuckers wanna talk but think they live it, no
I be ballin' stuck up in this pivot, where you trying to go?
Stuck up in this lavish living
Fucking with ghetto hoes truth be told it's money over bitches
Gotta get this dough I'm alone in this cold world
Let's go home cause we grown girl, let's get it on

Flossing diamonds to make them hate me more
Fuck the enemy
Die a slow death while you envy me
And I be ballin' like the MVPs
Motherfuckers cross me, now they're begging for my sympathy
Dreaming of millions of dollars and making bitches holla
Purple label collars and nothing but Devoni from product
Devonian nature got me caking
Every star you wanna see, in the belt, nigga I'm a make it
Stuck up in this californication
Got all the bad bitches swiping cards for that medication
And I get high, that's my meditation
All this determination got me
What in the world, nigga I'm a take it
So, give me what you got while I'm making it hot
Escalating to the top getting money 'til I drop
Sprinkle lavender then I roll up and I'm tippin'
Reminiscing on how the real Gs fuckin' did it
Thieving on niggas

Don't wish me death before I see a million
Before I see these hoes and I'm up there tell my mom that I lived it
Before they dunk a flow, motherfuckers wanna talk but think they live it, no
I be ballin' stuck up in this pivot, where you trying to go?
Stuck up in this lavish living
Fucking with ghetto hoes truth be told it's money over bitches
Gotta get this dough I'm alone in this cold world
Let's go home cause we grown girl, let's get it on

I be on the same shit Master Farak was teaching Elijah
I be with the same click shout outs to Bari and Elijah
Shout outs to Dev the young messiah
Shout outs to all of the young disciples
Shout outs to Rocky for pumpin' the fire
Toast up to the most high for making us higher
Those in the skies to the angels above
Don't feel the cries of them niggas below
Rollin' my eyes to the back of my dome
But I take one poke cause I don't really smoke
Hell if I could then I'd take one toke
Cause all of this pain ain't no joke
I feel the rain but my clothes ain't soaked
It's just no grub but it ain't got dope
If there's no bub then I ain't go hoes
Bitches dont want a buck if it ain't got Os
They want Os at the end up the bub
They want the Benz with the rims so gold
They want gems with the fancy clothes
And they went ham with the fancy clothes
Money on my mind and I shine
So all my niggas knew that they could get dough

Pull a chrome fifth when they murk them
Then murk off in Excursion
All cause a nigga be lurking
Big money shit we earning
A bunch of hooligans need churching
I'm the Hood Pope, these my children
And I'll be their Donnie McClurkin
Gold teeth when I'm smirking
Bunch of little kids running 'round need nurturing
Lord know that I ain't really perfect
All of these clowns run around this circus
Lord please, what is my purpose
Besides fucking these Persians?
Popping these bottles and popping these models
Please tell me where is the Sherman
And I'm smoking my weed, put me in my zone
Demons chasing me, cause they want my dome
And I carry the heat, and I sleep with the chrome
Cause I'm in some beef, and they want my dome

And they told you, told you time again
That ain't you gon' find your friends
You talking about you riding with them
And fighting with them, those ain't your friends
You dying, lying on cement, momma be crying ""Don't take him!
Gotta be trying but he sin, I promise he won't, ever again
God, he was a little child, he was a good kid for a while
He found the streets and then it got wild; God, I promise, never again
God, he is my only child, please awake him so he smiles""
But all she hear is lonely sounds, now he won't talk ever again

Study your scriptures and follow your God
Life in the trap I know times will get hard
I'll pick up your life, just abide by the Lord

Abide by the Lord
Abide by the Lord
Abide by the Lord (Alright!)

You 'bout to get it from a general, I don't know if they can hear me though
Don’t you niggas ever bother tryna see me, I'm a criminal
Oh Lord, once he's in the sight of a scope
I'ma let them have it when I sever
Damn, he wants to make me set it off
I'ma bury you motherfuckers without a coffin
Never taking no shorts, we never taking no losses
When you're dealing with my crew, A$AP, Bone, yeah, we bosses
Anybody with a bone to pick
Now when I level my charge, I'm damn sure to make it stick
You must be looking to suffer, well I'ma make it quick
Gotta train load of 'ish that’ll make ya sick
I'm here to wipe 'em out quicker than a pandemic
Bone came original, not a gimmick, can you dig it?
Hell yeah they can dig it while I'm sitting on my throne
Steady laughing at you niggas trying to get it 
(Get it, get it)

Man, I'm runnin 'til the end of this and I don't give a fuck if I was 86'd
A muthafucka play me like I'm Canibus
I'm ready for the battle like I'm takin' Diz
I'm never gonna take it in and nobody can break it in
As-salamu alaykum for the bacon
 and a little bit of coke
I put the cake in and it's certified dope
Having anything to do with it, we selling every rock that they can smoke
So take a toke and I'ma rake it in, Pillsbury the dough
To the dome like I'm seeking through the soul
Like I'm peeking through the soul
But I'm reekin like our reefer, rather keep up with her, go straight to the dro
Creeping on 'em, peeping on 'em, leave 'em in the zone
They don't even really know
Looking on 'em, keeping on 'em, taking every foe
For the love of the money, I gotta reap in what I sow
But I keep it what I know for the ending of the row, gotta go, will I go?
When I get it I'ma know to follow my known foe
Know Cali and know Coe, my caliber lock and load
Alabaster box
 when I cock and I crow
Got a Glock and I'm Bone Thug, where you wanna flow?
To the clock and the time zone
Spirit gon' fly, all y'all niggas dead to the life force cyclones
Right now when they hydro
What about the well known Cairo?

Got 'em stuck in the grave
I'm on the grind full time, never rest to get paid
A little hustling mothafucka put the brush to the face
I cut the braids, hit the stage, now they looking amazed
I went from cooking the yay to hundred thousand dollar shows
Got a booking today and I'ma split it with my bros
Gotta get it how we go, come meet me with the pros
No, I'm never gonna fold, watch the bank account grow
If it ain't about dough, then it ain't about jack
And I'ma take it like I want it, I ain't giving it back
I get us in with a stack and then I get on attack
I'm like the Tasmanian Devil
, 
nigga bigger than Shaq
Call the reaper, get the shovel, I'm a certified rebel
In a league of my own and that's a whole nother level
Nothing's free, I never settle, keep the pedal to the metal
When them haters in my rearview, hello, hello

Burn! Baby, let it burn, now it's my turn
I get in a nigga's system like a hundred vials of sherm
And then I kill 'em with two thousand words in two minutes
You never heard another nigga spit it like my niggas
Yeah, but you heard 'em try to get it but they couldn’t get it quicker than the realest
Man, they thinking they can deal with this and knock me out my rhythm
But I’m never gonna be the fuckin' victim
'Cause I’d rather be the suspect, haven't I given them enough yet?
Can't they understand they ain't dealing with a punk bitch?
One quick move and it's murder
And I'ma serve a nigga exactly what he deserving
A$AP, but wait a minute
I'm prolly one of the sickest niggas that ever did it, I'm in it 'cause I'ma win it
I'ma mothafuckin' lyrical tyrant, pivotal giant of this shit
And I do way more than just twist the words
You better listen and observe how I rip the verb
Niggas get the nerve to run up on me but my shit's superb
I’ll probably hit a nigga once 'fore he hit the curb
So get at me, I'm kinda trigger happy
When it come to shootin' my gift
, 
I'm like a .44 magnum, stag one
Backin' em up, body bag full of niggas' wack raps
That’s wack so I'm stacking em up
Kray Jack in the cut, still got a little bit of murder for 'em
Murderous poet, I create a bloody murder poem
So when they run up on me, nigga, be ready to show em
Redrum, redrum, redrum, redrum, rum rum rum rum

Yo, before this project
We’d like to thank the Most High
On behalf of the A$AP Mob, Bone Thug and all in attendance
Knowing that all things belong to those
For the cleanliness and the power, the first in the nation
To prove who they are
Through infinity, through eternity, through time span
Standing, one man, if you hold my hand, hold my hand
(Make sure it's a hand)
With all things around me, I will never win
I won’t win with angels, I won’t win with the brothers
I won’t win with Rome, I won’t win with Sodom and Egypt
(I keep a corpse close to my home)
Let us roll, tell them why we did what we did, if we did
In Jesus name, Amen",https://genius.com/A-ap-ferg-lord-lyrics

Reynolds,UnKnown,2013,"The last time I smoked, I think it was about a pound
I thought Lou laced my weed, I was about to pan 'em out
And he told me quietly, ""Nigga, you was on the loud""
I was running 'round the room, Rocky tried sat me down
I went to club with, and I seen Busta Rhymes with the red neck
And he looking at me like, ""Nigga, you sniffed a line?""
You heard this before, you probably would have lost your mind
But I had to change my lines cause TT didn't like my rhymes
Everybody always giving praise to the team
When all my niggas do is get fly and sip lean
Niggas think we're stupid, with all these designer things
We walk in Hilfigers office and hear that ching-ching
We get paid from Tommy the rest of y'all niggas silly
And walk in office meetings with camoflauge and a philly
And only get brain from the bitches that know the dealy
She rocked the mic and killed lipsync like Milly Vanilli

Being broke be the best thing that happened to me
It give me hunger pain, something strange happened to me
It fills my brain up with things so imaginary
Then I start to spit flames with vocabulary
My momma thought I wouldn't make it with this rapping shit
Lint in my pockets and I still ain't ask for shit
Dreams of traveling the world so lav-er-ish
Fuck a couple bitches that be fucking with them tab-a-lets
Lean sip' fabrics, you nigga is average
I'm about a mothafuckin' buck like Maverick
Fucking hoes in palaces,
 
posing for the cameras
Fans scream, ""Lord!"" like a mothafuckin' catholic
Hoes tryna snap a pic, while a nigga tapping it
Bitches love my words, on stage they try to grab my dick
I'm the best when it comes to this rapping shit
I eat a nigga sleeping like bed bugs in mattresses
Still up in the hood with them stragglers
Fourty calibers if a nigga talking blasphemous
Young Trap Lord, I'm going back to Nazereth
Lean got me slurring like I got Ty Nast's lisp

Excellent weekends are with kinky whores
Flow like meteor, your mediocre retard, 
put you in the ER
No CPR to bring you back,
 
when I pull out this Eagle
Squeeze her like kegel, sitting in a Regal
Blaze a blunt of sour, now I'm higher than a seagull
Never ever pass unless you're on of my amigos
'bout to have a trio, call that shit a sequel
Me fucking these hoes, we listening to Beanie Sigel
Ain't no way you're equal, nigga why you hating?
It's over for 30 seconds like gang initiation
Put dots between 'em like abbreviation
Put his ass to sleep like sed-ed-ation

Racks on top of stacks and stacks on top of them racks
Move like that on them cats, you move like that and get smacked
I wipe a hundred on my momma, I'm using that like Proac'

I got a hundred dollar bill to get the bump off your face
I got a hundred dollar bill to get them bumps off your face
I got a hundred dollar bill to get them bumps off your face
Got a hundred dollar bill to get them bumps off your face
Use these hundred dollar bills to get these bumps off your face
Now use these hundred dollar bills to get these bumps off your face
I got a hundred dollar bill to get these bumps off your face
Got a hundred dollar, got damn

Now I'm lookin' through the window and the sky's so blue
Lookin' through the window and my grass' so green
Lookin' through my window, hold on I know you
Hollup, is that Adam Levine?
Adam Levine, I got a hundred
Adam Levine, I got a hundred
Adam Levine, I got a hundred
Adam Levine, I got a hundred

I'm ballin', ballin', I'm shot callin'
Gotta brush the gold grills when I wake in the mornin'
You can smell that champagne when a nigga be yawnin'
And I'm straight shittin' on you cause it's lyrical on it
Got a hundred dollar bill for every bump on your face
I got a hundred dollar bill for every bump on your face
I got a hundred dollar bill for every bump on your face
I got a hundred dollar bill for every bump on your face",https://genius.com/A-ap-ferg-doe-active-lyrics

Toupee'd on a bitch like an old fella
Souffle on a bitch cause my dough better
Used to go to Mickie D's with no cheddar
Now my chauffeur I get fuckin' so feta
Now let's go to Sue's Rendezvous
Most of your crew be strange dudes
Two bitches like déjà vu
Blowin' that skunk like Pepé Le Pew
Make it hot in here like Nelly
Make her side burn like Ashanti's 'do
Murderin' Ink like I'm Irv Gotti

I came from the dirt up, and did the unheard of
Hoes say I'm the man, mm-hmm I concur it
I'm young and perverted
If I don't get the pussy or the payment, what the fuck is the purpose?
Don't call on my phone, unless you're the fam or my girl
I'm a just say it's no service, stay connected as cursive
I bet if you put my name on it that I make it bigger
She saying she wanna take a picture, I let her take a picture
But don't send it to me 'less it's fuckin naked pictures
Feel me, I'm into safe sex-y, latex-y, rubber stretch-y
Good weed, no stress-y
You can get your broke bestie, show your chesties
Tell your boyfriend to stay off my testes, lil' bitch
What he tryin' to say?
Make that 9 shake, pump up the crime rate
Pump up the value, make that bitch vibrate
Pump up the alcohol on the hydrate, she thirsty
And that's a damn shame
Red bone, white money, blue dream that's my campaign
I order Hors d'oeuvres, roll up more herb
I hit it, I bust, and throw it to Ferg, for sure

Fuck around and sing like I'm Ja Rule, hah

The first time I smoked weed, it was with Bloody Rose
Skinny black motherfucker cornrows to the back
Had a knack to say brrrrrat
Had three cigarette burns in his arm, he wore a gat in his clothes
He said, ""I'mma be blood 'til the day I die Fergie when you coming home""
His little brother Donny was my best friend and he was a blood
And his daddy in the pen and he was too
And his mom ya ya even she was a blood
Donny had a set called LN-Dub they wore a burgundy flag to show their blood-ily love
For 31 seconds in an elevator baa like a hundred niggas
Go nigga rep your thug
They came back with stories like we just got a popping
Still breathing hard cause that Glock 9 was popping
They hear bodies dropping, the opposites dying
Your son is gone and a few mommas crying
You know I ain't lying, Ferg satisfying
Shit done got turnt up and bullets was flying
Couple niggas got burnt up due to all this violence
All you hear is the sound of the doosh doosh but no sirens

On this side niggas got fat gats
Point them at the enemy and go bllllrat rat
Nigga nigga I'm from Bompton
If you grew up in the hood you got no option
If you ran into the hood then that's your problem
Hi mom I'm a blood now what you know 'bout it
On this side niggas getting DP'd
Get your ass whooped in front of all your hommies
This the type shit to have a motherfucking bitch ass nigga snitching on his homies
So I'm bicken back being bool (I'm bicken back being bool)

I was only fourteen years old in that pussy hair
It was drawings of bugs bunny on the wall
With Yosemite Sam his gun was tall
Backwards clothes on like Kriss Kross
Man this shit is looney toon who did this shit dawg
I was gang affiliated like Shakur
Rest in Peace to who ain't make it man, I'm pissed off
They live by it so they dying by the pistol
And they hate to see a nigga pop crystal
Shit dawg every time I think about that shit dawg
I pour another bottle, let the floor dissolve

Check out my walk because it is so amazing
Nothing like Bobby Shmurda's but I congratulate him
More like a gangsta lean let's get this picture painted
Drop it low then pick it up before you hit the pavement
I was confined to crime since I was about 5 years old
Now nigga make up your mind you gonna rap or sell dope
I was followed like crazy this rapper life a pillow
But don't sleep on this nigga because I'm hard as brillo
Nigga I ain't no game, I never played Nintendo
Through puberty, I was popping pussy and popping pimples
Popping cuties with heavy booties and pretty dimples
C'mon do the dope dance, man it's pretty simple

Now do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
A-do the dope-de-dope dope walk

I almost fell I gotta pick it up
I almost fell I gotta pick it up
Got a story to tell, let me let you know what's up
I got a story to tell let me let you know what's up
I was at Abyssinian playing basketball
But it was different from playing basketball at the park
Cause at the park the Dominicans had the packs of raw
That would make the fiends lean but they never fall
All that standing on the block just like a Pokemon (pika)
Dope dealers sitting like I gotta catch em' all
Uh gotta catch em' all like the theme song
I ain't Morgan Freeman, ain't no one to lean on
I'm a dope dealer, on a dope walk
Now the sky turn to blue gotta get this dope off
They’re like Menace II Society with O-Dog
Now the fiends leaning like he bout to touch his toe dog, look y'all
I'm the dope lord and y'all my fiends, y'all wanted this all your life
I’ve been coming up with hits like constantly, and you know my shit’s so tight
And all of y'all rappers got nothing on me, this shit I ain't even write
And all of y'all bitches they on my D, cause they wanna hit this pipe
(Yeezus style scream)

1,2,3 Go
A-do the dope walk, I just don't walk
A-do the dope walk, I just don't walk
A-do the dope walk, I just don't walk

Don't want you to run away from me darling
This life can be so cold
Now what you feel
Don't want you to run away from me honey
I want us to grow old

We talk about art then end up on sex
We text for hours, you're so complex
Not your average girl in spandex
Who chase Bent-e-leys and Rolex
You wear them baggy jeans like Aaliyah
Your body so mean, I can tell you got a booty like Selena
Girl, you're 'bout to have me catch a fever
I can't lie, I get happy every time a nigga see ya
The way you move, the way you groove
Is so appealing
I'm usually not that dude caught up in all these feelings
I've been around the world and dealt with all these women
Through all these different girls, this is the realest feeling

I'm tired of the waiting (so tired)
I think I want the real thing, I know you got it
I'm tired of lonely (so tired)
I think I want the real thing, I know you got it

What you feel
Don't want you to run away from me darling
This life can be so cold
Now what you feel
Don't want you to run away from me honey
I want us to grow old

Sort of 
afrocentric
, you been thick
Pearly white teeth like you live at the dentist
Impeccable freckle, you put a spell on niglet
Room full of syringes, she got me addicted
Body authentic, how do you bend it?
Got her too tempted
I don't know how to prevent it
I will go into it, party 'til I go limp dick
Run in that clitoris, like I'm in the Olympics
Swinging that diznick, til it's all in appendix
She be likin' it nasty, I like when you rinse it
Rinse it off like candy rain
Say my name three times like Candyman
Oh, cause our love so so real
That a nigga want to score like Shaquille O'Neal
And she fly like an eagle, so I call her Seal
Let nothing get in between what you feel

I'm tired of the waiting (so tired)
I think I want the real thing, I know you got it
I'm tired of lonely (so tired)
I think I want the real thing, I know you got it

Elijah smoking that smelly, ménages in the telly
Blonde bitch named Shelly, dick all in her belly
I met that bitch at a fashion show, she was rocking Margiela
I was with Kwasi Kessie rocking all that Versace
Might be in there sailing, smoking all that Beijing
Ten stacks in my pocket,  for no reason I got it
Fuck around and hit Sin City, tell that bitch to pop it
What's up with you and Purrp? I ain't into all of that gossip
He brought the funk into my crew,  you gotta ask Rocky about it
All I know is A$AP riding in them Maybachs
40. cal, we spray that, when AK brratt you take nap
Oh, Lord, that Hood Pope - oh, Lord, that Trap Lord
Why they call you Trap Lord? Cause you a rap lord to my casket
I ain't bowing to no time, Hood Pope on my gold shine
My dirty niggas wanna tote nine, but we talk rhyme
I tell 'em hold up

All I know is that Trap Lord, that Hood Pope
All I know is that Trap Lord, but you're a rap Lord to my casket
All I know is that fast Porsche smoking that good smoke

Riding 'round the city feeling like P. Diddy
Glock 9 in my silk shirt, nigga, no Pac, and no Biggie
Riding 'round the city feeling like P. Diddy
Glock 9 in my silk shirt, nigga, no Pac, and no Biggie

No reply when you call Lord, mama cry 'til her throat sore
Liechtenstein when I drunk four you was dying in this war hall
Body left near the staircase courtesy of the whole mob
Don't mean no fucking thing when I pull up in that Goyard
Shooked up from that toe star, ask questions like Nardwuar
Like can you feel your fucking legs? I bet that nigga cannot walk
Persian bitch stack coke hard, sniff white 'till her nose soft
I fucked that bitch with no rubber, cause that bitch be so raw
Puff-puff when the semi pump, nigga really gonna pop
Trunks when you see me duck, niggas really want
Y'all punks can't see the God trap, Trini' Lord
And I click like Donkey Kong when I hit this long
Better run when you see the mob, you be seeing God
Hear the drum when my niggas march, you gon' see Allah
You the son of a bitch nigga, you daddy a broad
You a bitch, little bitch nigga, probably wearing bras

And it comes to find out, his black ass couldn't even penetrate

Just got back from Bonnaroo, that shit was amazing

Express Yourself set the tone, by Diplo
Today was blazing so they taking off their shit slow
Show them titties, show them titties, 
me and Marty screaming
TJ on the 1 and 2s, he got the party heating

God got me on a mission, nigga, I'mma keep preaching
Lords Never Worry, point blank period
We divine and then shine through these dark demons
Flying vultures, bra leeches
Moment you want some pussy, they act like they can't believe it
They got a rap nigga like ""well, at least can I see it?""
Claiming you got a man, you was outside my trailer just fiending
Giving me celibate speeches, I got a hell of a penis
Give you that crack pipe, girl, who the hell is your dealer?
She laughing now, you acting mad cause I ain't let you beat it
I play myself anyway cause you the weakest
Now I'm straight off the stage into the tour bus
Had enough of these hoes, it's time to get focused
I couldn't figure what to write
Until I mumbled some words and started on the chorus

All of my life and all of my days
I never thought I would be here, I never thought I would be here
All of my life and all of my days
I never thought I would be here, and I feel it now, and my bones and my body wanna lift off

I spoke to Lauryn last night, man, she still got it
She performed Ready Or Not, the whole set was rocking
Skrillex brought me out before her set, I did Shabba
She said ""I watched the whole thing, Ferg, your shit was proper""
Damn, Lauryn was watching my show?
Plus I came out to Juicy and I fucked that Biggie flow
But it was cool cause the crowd caught the words for me
And when I did Work, they sung the whole shit for me
Coogi down to the socks, then the crowd applaud
I'm getting rich so I gotta stop the stage dive
Ain't smoked in a minute, but I sorta get a stage high
Especially when I'm done and the whole crowd stay live
I'm tired as hell, still come out for the encore
Looking fatigued, I'm out of breath, I need to run more
Then I hit my DJ like ""we got one more""
And we nod, yeah, then I go for it, like

All of my life and all of my days
I never thought I would be here, I never thought I would be here
All of my life and all of my days
I never thought I would be here, and I feel it now, and my bones and my body wanna lift off",https://genius.com/A-ap-ferg-bonnaroo-lyrics
Commitment Issues,Ferg Forever,2014,"I wonder why I can't commit sometimes
Somewhere along down the line, it's affecting my mind
I wonder why I can't commit sometimes
Somewhere along down the line, it's affecting my mind
I wonder why I can't commit sometimes
Somewhere along down the line, it's affecting my mind

Woke up, seen Daddy in bed with another woman
Thought that was Mama, ""hey ma""- hold up, that couldn't
Be her, what I'm thinking, cause she just went to work
It was a naked look-a-like and Daddy there with no skirt
See, Daddy was getting busy when I barged in
Then when I said ""mommy?"", he chuckled and grinned
Then I soon realized that the  crust in my eyes
Had the chick looking like Mama love from the side
See, Daddy was a player and I wasn't surprised
He would holla at the girls when we rolled with the guys
Should I hate or embrace these ties?
I mean, I praise this dude, god's sake, he's fly
He couldn't do no wrong in my eyes
But at the same time, I hated to see my mama cry
Ain't no wonder why I can't commit sometimes
Somewhere along down the line, it's affecting my mind

I wonder why I can't commit sometimes
Somewhere along down the line, it's affecting my mind
I wonder why I can't commit sometimes
Somewhere along down the line, it's affecting my mind
I wonder why I can't commit sometimes
Somewhere along down the line, it's affecting my mind
I wonder why I can't commit sometimes
Somewhere along down the line, it's affecting my mind

I've got commitment issues, did from when I was young
Wasn't tryna fit in my uncle's Timberlands, he was dumb
His shoe was too small to fit my big toe in
Ain't wanna walk in his shoes, he was just hoeing
He stayed broke, them bitches provided for him
Whether skinny, fat, black or tyrannosaurus
He was a gigolo, and never minded whoring
Guess the money gave him new ways to ignore it
Pussy is pussy, and new clothes the way he saw it
This ain't Enyce nigga, what she brought in?
To see him kiss her ass made me nauseous
Then he'd give her sloppy hugs like my baby gorgeous
He was just doing that for the new forces
All this fucking bullshit that had my brain distorted
Ain't no wonder why I can't commit sometimes
Somewhere along down the line, it's affecting my mind

I wonder why I can't commit sometimes
Somewhere along down the line, it's affecting my mind
I wonder why I can't commit sometimes
Somewhere along down the line, it's affecting my mind
I wonder why I can't commit sometimes
Somewhere along down the line, it's affecting my mind
I wonder why I can't commit sometimes
Somewhere along down the line, it's affecting my mind

I've got commitment issues, even with my craft
Didn't think Willie Lynch was that good at math
Took a lil' black baby 'way from mom and dad
Now he lost in the field and it's so sad
The mind of a slave, at a young age
Can't talk to a girl or know how to engage
He think being a gentleman is wrong and gay
But he feel that way cause that's how he was raised
He watched dad diss mom, she got play
And your uncle only had a girl when he got paid
All this shit put my life in a maze
Then when I grow up, marriage in a haze
Ain't no wonder why I can't commit sometimes
Somewhere along down the line, it's affecting my mind
To all the ladies, I'll just say it one more time
Somewhere along down the line, it's affected our minds

I wonder why I can't commit sometimes
Somewhere along down the line, it's affecting my mind
I wonder why I can't commit sometimes
Somewhere along down the line, it's affecting my mind
I wonder why I can't commit sometimes
Somewhere along down the line, it's affecting my mind
I wonder why I can't commit sometimes
Somewhere along down the line, it's affecting my mind",https://genius.com/A-ap-ferg-commitment-issues-lyrics

Old lady upstairs was snitching on him

Can't hold it back anymore
Let it go
Let it go
Turn away and slam the door

What they're going to say
Let the storm rage on
The cold never bothered me

Cop guns cause they stay in some beef
Then they ride with them guns in the street (All the time)
My niggas be uber the Jeep
Personal driver whenever we creep
Guns gon fly open whenever we meet
And I'm grabbing them guns out the seat
Cause I heard you got it for cheap
Got it for low, and we trying to eat
With my flow, I could rock you to sleep
And knock them birds off in a week
We ain't come for no games
Now my niggas ain't playing
What the fuck is you saying?
Motherfucker y'all paying
All them hammers is spraying
All your bodies is staying
Y'all niggas ain't show me no love
I remember they tried to act tough
Now when I walk in the club, I light up my weed, and them niggas they all want to puff
What the fuck is that stuff?
We don't rock like that, and ya niggas really ain't gon pop like that
They not like that, they don't fight back
Tell 'em shoot and them niggas give the Glock right back

Uncle,Ferg Forever,2014,"Let's ask a question of real life
How you gon keep it
You gon keep it trill
You gon keep it real
You gon keep it to yourself
Or you gon keep it away from what it should be
Ask yourself

You was devil walking I mean you never taught me nothing
Talking about you knuck if you buck
You walk through the block as if you was tough
You was always got fucked up
Oh, my uncle got stabbed?
Granddad, he never gave 2 fucks, claimed it was good for your ass
Oh no love from your dad, is that, the reason you act up
Grandma always spoiled you
Even kept your mac tucked in her mattress
How could you ask for trust?
You's a junkie smoked on glass dick and be holding glass nuts
Grandma was ""Ma"" and Auntie was ""Sis""
She was my best friend even taught me how to kiss
You was in and out always get up in some shit
Quick to lock a door, while that blood is dripping from your lip
I learnt nothing from you, you took my chain cause you said it glist
I was only 8 I still loved you cause ignorance is bliss
You's a bitch probably in the bathroom rubbing on your clit
Claim you committing suicide, motherfucker then slit your wrist
I'm different from you, because you live to die and I die to live
Good riddance for you, cause you a handicap with nothing to give
Go fuck yourself cause you better off not having a kid
Got two sisters pregnant now they brothers and cousins and shit
Confused as fuck, a lot for a toddler growing up
No wonder why I had anxiety in school throwing up
You claim you know my life but you don't know wassup
All you know is keeping it trill and that fucking stuff (what, what)

They walk back into my life
They walk back into my life
They walk back into my life
They walk back into my life
(They walk back into my life)
Don't walk back into my life
Don't walk back into my life
Don't walk back into my life
Don't walk back into my life
Don't walk back into my life
(Don't walk back into my life)

I wanted to be just like you
Wear Beef and Broccoli Timbs just like you
Army fatigue pants just like you
I wanted to get box braids be a man just like you
You had a move called the Psycho I wanted to dance just like you
You listen to O.D.B. that was your idol
And that explains your drug habit he was a man just like you
Always getting locked up with no plans for life
You drowned your life with 40 ounces, contraband with pipes too
My chain wasn't enough, you even stole my bike too
Claimed you'd bring it back tomorrow after that I ain't like you
Always running to my ma talking 'bout you got a job
But you still begging for dollars for a fucking metro card
But I still love you uncle even though times is hard
I know you see me shining somewhere near the stars
(5,4,3,2,1) 

They walk back into my life
They walk back into my life
They walk back into my life
They walk back into my life
(They walk back into my life)
Don't walk back into my life
Don't walk back into my life
Don't walk back into my life
Don't walk back into my life
Don't walk back into my life

To talk about oppression

Cause they don't give two shits about me
I mean we when I say, Ferguson, they talk about me
Little brown, Mike Brown
Shot down in Missouri
They keep us in misery
And get a desk job when the coroner leave
They don't even take they badge, a racist act
Just take a president to make 'em black
Hope that we live in bliss
And take a nap to create with the same brush that paint the past
Cause it's still the same shit
We don't run it up for no help
Cause you know we bound to get hit

Hate in the game
Be the same niggas that you made your friend
You give me a beat, they ain't play it then
Then you run around town like you made my name
Showed you nothin' but love

What about old friends that claim I change
I ain't changed, I'm grown about my change

They build you up to make the kill
To break you down, and claim you ain't real

Oh he moved on, dreamed the pay-off
Fly state to state, two white girls in his arms
Mr. Hollywood don't like us no more""
Nah, that's a lie
I like any girl with eyes, cutie pies
Fat ass, sumo thighs
Any complexion, girl you could be mine

It's an appetite for destruction out here
The mob is equipped with full-armed artillery
What ya gon' do?
(DJ Drama, fuck these niggas up!)

I was born in Harlem where them things pop
At the block parties, niggas had to run
And they caught the motherfuckers on the same block
And they all at the war with the gun
R.I.P. Lil Na, Sharon, why they kill ya son?
Damn it, if I could've did it, I'mma hit 'em with the ton
Clit-a-dick, little-dick, feeling shit, hot in you lungs
Turn you bitch niggas to a couple nuns (lay 'em down)
I came in the store and saw the whole thing
He said, I hope that you not one of them
Then I run around the corner, got the OG's
I told 'em, We got jumped by a couple punks
I swear to God, these niggas softer than the Brady Bunch
They gon' get it, man, this shit been goin' for a couple months
Then turn around the corner, seen a crowd looking stunned
With the all shaking on the floor, not saying nothin'

This just where we from
We all dyin' some day
At a picnic having fun
Probably dyin' by the gun
This just where we from
We prayin' every Sunday
When the killas gonna come
She about to lose her son, son

Let me D bop
Spanish nigga, everybody thought he black (From the block)
Used to wear a tank top with a fresh fade
OJ, kinda fat, (OJ give low)
Face stay greasy pollo all you eatin'
Thug nigga with the Cuban on the neck
Always carried a tech, Dominicano
Trappin' the bando, Orlando, he was Diablo in the flesh
Dimelo got into a little mess with D Bach
And he shot up the block with the Desert
'Bout to leave him messy but the bullets hit the belly
You could call me Hollywood, not ""the hood Tyler Perry""
Niggas making movies, more niggas getting buried
Niggas died, Desert, but this shit ain't really necessary
Caught up in the life, he got rich and got blurry
He took his own life and the one that he married, Ferg

Thug Cry,Ferg Forever,2014,"15 years of my life, I was locked in prison
Thought shit would hold me down, but the clock kept on ticking
Time kept on slipping, plus I just got sentenced
Now my collect calls got your bills going ballistic
I should've been there taking care of the children
And I worried about all them snot-nosed women
While I was in Carolina flipping birds in the kitchen
You heard that wasn't the only type of birds I was flipping

I can make a thug cry, tonight
Watch me make a thug cry, tonight
Cause that's how true love is supposed to be, ain't it?
When it feels so good it shakes all your belief, baby
I can make a thug cry, tonight
(I can make you cry tonight, tonight)
I can make a thug cry, tonight

Then I got married to you, Richard Porter didn't do it
He was too busy getting busy, all of which was foolish
I know you tired of all of my ""didn't do it""s
All of my promises and all of my ""I'mma prove it""s
You knew something was up when I all of a sudden took two trips
Two trips turned into too many excuses
I gotta hustle two more months, babe, just two flips
Meanwhile, you had me a child and he was toothless
I was living wild down south, had me a new bitch
Brought her ass a brand new car, lived in a new crib
Hmm, second child on the way, juggling two bibs
Then you got a call from shawty like ""bitch, who this?""
This is why it finished, baby mama, he got two kids
Tell his funky ass that I'm leaving, fucking doofus
Afraid to come home cause I know what I did was stupid
And you still forgave my stupid ass, uh

I can make a thug cry, tonight
Watch me make a thug cry, tonight
Cause that's how true love is supposed to be, ain't it?
When it feels so good it shakes all your belief, baby
I can make a thug cry, tonight
(I can make you cry tonight, tonight)
I can make a thug cry, tonight

There's something about you
Baby, we got to get lost in the moment
You and me only

And now that I'm locked up, I expect you to stay
Like somebody coming to kill you and expect you to lay
You stopped sending commissary durags upon me
Guess you figured that other chick'd take care of my ways
Don't you forget you're my wife, like that meant something
Then blow kisses in the phone like that did something
Then you stopped my visits, heard you got pregnant
By that nigga, I just act like, ""Y'all been fucking""
But I knew that wasn't true, you was just tired
And somewhere in your heart, my love sit higher
But a good man is what you desire
And this is what it sound like when a thug crying, I'm crying

I can make a thug cry, tonight
Watch me make a thug cry, tonight
Cause that's how true love is supposed to be, ain't it?
When it feels so good it shakes all your belief, baby

I was in Greensboro with about five women
Laying in bed, 'bout to fuck five women
Marty bitch choked cause she seen me in the linen
Put the Yoko Ono bitch like my name John Lennon
Tones got mad cause he wasn't really winning
Then he took his ass to sleep, that was only the beginning
He was tired, see, I swear
He was tired, see
I told them bitches ""let's play a game""
Weave on the floor, ass up was the aim
Take clothes off, I'm about to do my thing
She make it disappear like her name David Blaine, I ain't lying
All the bitches got bucking naked
She threw that ass on me quick, wait a fucking second

Niggas in the cut all of these bitches getting focused
She gon' pop that pussy for a G
The spotlight is on a 10, 20 inch D
I've recorded for my niggas just in case they wanna see
She whispered in my ear, she said that she a freak
Put my hand on her lips, told a bitch ""don't speak""
Keep it coming like a red nose, shake it for a treat
Said oh my god, damn it, she remind me of a masterpiece
Cause her body 'bout it, yeah, we crowd around it
And don't stop, she what, what, drop it like it's hot
That ho over the top, definition of a thot
She a threat, a threat, 
Like she tryna give me head
 shake it till your ass shots pop
After you back it up, then drop

I'm feeling like this one 'bout to pop
Feeling how Ferg was feeling when Work was 'bout to drop
Nigga, you know that feeling, that work you 'bout to cop
You paranoid cause they making you circle round the block
I jumped over you lames, I'm now hot
If I really wanted you dead already, you'd been shot
I ain't playing with you dames, I'm giving these fiends rocks
Spit it, I'm wicked with it, I cooked that up in the pot
Switching, twisting the floors, they wondering ""will it stop?""
Started off at the bottom and ended up at the top
Started off with a dollar and ended up making guap
All I had was a dream, been spitting since 17
Now I'm on all these 
And no, I ain't got time to diss you lame
Niggas, they ain't fucking with my pistol game
They want molly and coke, I bought Crystal Caines

Fuck hoes, need to get my life back
Fuck it, need to get my life on the right track
I bought you Alexander Wang, I know you like that
With a dinner at Felice with a nice snack
Them Twitter bitches lyin', I ain't pipe that
I'm 'bout to start a pussy riot, need a light pack
Cause I come with groupie bitches, they don't like that
Tried to fuck with groupie bitches, they don't like that
All I need is you for a night cap
Beat that pussy up then I'm gonna give it an ice pack
Damn, I think a nigga picked the right track
With a tough beat with a light rap
I'm tired of givin' you niggas a nice trap

DTM Awards 14',UnKnown,2014,"When my daddy died I went through deep depression
T Ferg was on the run, he was a felon
My uncle dipping T up in the cell and
He was in them shackles since an adolescent
Now he out them jumpsuits and that's a blessin'
When it's tough I tell him never get discouraged
I'mma take you out the hood, uncle, don't worry
And now he first class at different telly's
And he love that shit, nigga love that shit
Cause your nephew made it
Now we on them tourbuses, getting faded
Eight band in that sock, fucking Asians
All she know is sucky, suck, fuck what I'm saying
I hope this cock'll fit, that's what I'm praying
And baby if you hear this song I'm playing
Japan was fun as hell, all that I'm saying
Kawaii to my pretty Asians
Shout outs to my mama, 
rest in peace to my daddy
Shout outs to uncle T, I'mma put you in a caddy
Shout outs to Pretty Flacko, Yamborghini and Jabari
I'mma let y'all ugly niggas know I love you

Ain't no rewards for that
Ugly ass niggas, I love y'all
Yeah, ain't no rewards for that
I swear

That verse right there, was for my momma
Shouts out to the lady, I'm thinking you did it
She grew me and raised me and tutored me daily
Cause school was crazy
And who would've knew that Ru would've made it
The blueprint you laid it and we conversated
Heated and debated on what I would do if school didn't make it
I dropped out of school and ooh you hated
You didn't want me to look foolish, nigga
Who would be bigger than Yohji Yamamoto
Fendi and Versace, blue is her favorite
You didn't want  to take me
I get it, you didn't want to lose your baby
But now your friends say ''who your baby?
The one with the crew and them dudes is crazy''
Especially Marty and Lou be hazy

So I'm back in New York and we talk on the phone
She tell me that she want me back can I keep it at home
I got a growing career can't just leave it alone

Art Basel night out but I'm caught up in the spot
Left the Pigalle party, I'm in the crib tryna plot
I can't even sleep, I'm tryna get the guap
I'm thinking all I need is a big tour with RiRi
And a couple more radio hits to get TV
Just hit Virgil to try to get Yeezy
He working on the album so it ain't gon' be easy
Damn, and my girl just caught a nigga
Rolled up unannounced she ain't even call a nigga
Seen shawty through my door and got in all her feelings
Going crazy, hope she don't get your boy evicted
Shit and I ain't even call them niggas
It's been a long time since I even talk to niggas
Couple childhood friends turned to awkward niggas
Cause when you get Benjamins there come in all the villains
More money, more problems, this shit is real life
The game is WCW real trife
Dumb, broke up with a good girl who had my back
Now it's gonna be hard to find a real wife
Time to deal with the snakes and all the fake loving
Why every time when she fuck me she always want somethin'?
Always asking 'bout ""who's who?"" and ""who's that?""
And oh, I do's this, do you rap?
Opportunists are opportunists becoming fluent
Cleopatra in every factor, she never losin'
She will juice them until his empire come to ruins
Sometimes I think, ""what the fuck am I doing?""
I'm strong but I'm only human
And my tolerance is low so I'm never using
Sometimes I wish Yams was never using
When we toured in UK I knew I'd lose him
Yeah, I know I'd lose him
He went to rehab the year before and he seen improvement
But the fame and access is what abused him
But he in heaven now and I know God'll use him
Yeah, I know God'll use him

And this world is a whack bitch, she never faithful
She would fuck any rich nigga for diamond Jesus

And this world is a whack bitch, she never faithful
She would fuck any rich nigga for diamond Jesus

Play you, play you, play you

Shit feeling too hard to get far
Feeling like a butterfly, shit, stuck in a glass jar
Wanna be the man, you gotta risk it all
Girlfriend's friends and even your good Lord
All the sacrifice got me thinking 'bout a vice
I wish my daddy was here to give me some advice
I’m thinking ‘bout Jamaica to live the rest of my life
Get money, leave the game and live me a new life
Shit, I could live me a new life
Disappear like Pac and marry a good wife
The pressure getting to me and all I can do is write
Giving back to my hood, hope what I'm doing is right
I know what I'm doing is right
I mean, what I'm doing is, like...
A couple Ferg health fears, few songs on the mic
Inspire these kids to change their wrongs to right
This is what I'm doing for life
What I'm pursuing in life
I'm suffering from survival's guilt
How I made it out the hood and how Noah got killed
Why my friends ain't make it and they so ambitious?
Why they get distracted by the parties and bitches?
Why I ain't get stuck doing the dishes?
At Ben and Jerry's, free scoops for the bitches
Went from ice cream to ice and creams
Gotta pinch myself cause I'm living the dream
But this life ain't all it seems
To get my nigga back, I give all these things
Yeah, Yamborghini, I know you see me, I know you see me
I know it's a couple little kids that wanna be me
I worked hard to get where I am, it ain't easy
Yeah, and this shit ain't easy

Tatted angel, I'm cuffed to hell with diamond bangles
And this world is a whack bitch, she never faithful
She would fuck any rich nigga for diamond Jesus
If you wanna get in the game watch how she play you
Play you, play you, play you

Sometimes I wish I wasn't famous
Sometimes I wish I wasn't famous
Wish I wasn't famous
Then I would know who's really by my side
Sometimes I wish I wasn't famous
Swear to God, I wish I wasn't famous
Oh, God, I wish I wasn't famous
Oh, God, I wish I wasn't famous

Amca-T iyi durumda, eski bir hücreden 1. sınıfa
Federallerin içinde 15 sene geçirdi, hiç posta almıyordu
Babam öldü ve de kuzenimde
Onları hiç hücrenin dışına salmadılar
Tüm mahallemi işe soktum, şimdi duramam

Woo üstümdeki ekstaziyi yeni çektim, tanrı biliyor ki daha yeni stoğu tazeledim
Yeni özel tasarım kıyafetler ile Dib ve dab dansı yapıyorum
Bu yarı gözükmeyen ile dib ve dab yaptım
Kırmızı halının üzerindesin ve etrafın pop yıldızı dolu ama sert davranmaya çalışıyorsun
Üzerimde actavis tutmalıyım, zenci, ve onu karıştırdım
Bu orospunun içinde sigara içemeyeceğimizi söylediler

With slacks and shoes on, with the TEC-9 on
Just - you know what I'm saying? Just scoping out for a bit
Yeah Psych, you used to have the TEC with the good pants?
You know, we was just hungry like that
Too tired of shooting in the air cause I can't get my way and shit

Grandma hid that hammer in her mattress from my uncle
He would listen to Wu-Tang 'fore walkin' in the jungle
Army fatigue jacket, kitchen knife, hope he don't cut you
With a deuce-deuce up in his boot in case he get in tussles

(And he will!)  Let it bang, let it bang, let it bang
(And he will!) Let it bang, let it bang, let it bang
(And he will!) Let it bang, let it bang, let it bang

Lightpost workout, how he turned out
Granddaddy tried to help him but he burnt out
He screamed, ""Lazy fucker, won't you try to get a job?""
Block party where the hoochies turned out
They would dance and sweat they perm out
If they scream, ""We got beef"" he would handle with no prob
Cologne and liquor was his odor, fragrance of a ridin' soldier
ODB was his persona, he was high on Mars
40 ounce and then some marijuana
When grandma died from pneumonia
Now his life a roller coaster, put that shit on God

18 slangin' that Coupe Deville
Young nigga, young nigga move that dope

12 years clutchin' that steel
Pop a nigga more than them pills
Pistol under sheet when I sleep
Body niggas like I do beats
I ain't talkin' bout my uncle, this me
Made another million this week
Swagger make a Bentley look cheap
I'm the reason why your momma OD'd
I'm the reason why your homies ain't deep
Now you wanna talk about peace
Pimpin' bitches all in these streets
Wonderin' why you rubbin' her feet
If you got high off what I sold
How his teeth platinum when he on shit row?
Big belly ballin' like I'm still gettin' throwed
Leave a nigga flat 'til his body get towed
Sad that the curtain got closed
Leave him with a hole in his skull

And he took both kids to the ghetto ass park

He used to have the braids with the cuts in his body
Most thugged out, kept the hammer with his mami
Grandma had the arthritis pain in her body
Kept the burner in the mattress, so her son don’t catch a body
Danced and he danced, smoked crack with his posse
Front flipped through a building window, land in the lobby
He was cut like Bruce Lee but he didn't know karate
He came home bloody screaming, ""Nobody can stop me!
Nobody can stop me, I'm the baddest survivor on this planet
Fifty niggas better kill me, nigga, 'cause I will do damage
Checked outta the psych ward, I am nothing to manage

Hungry Ham, fuck around and get killed
When he got kicked out of his bitch crib
And he had nowhere to li-zive
Always find his ass on the benches laying at the park
After dark

Don't get it confused Uncle Psych, I love you to death
Just wanna get a couple of things off of my chest
Growing up, you always was buck-wilding with stress
And though I'm older now, I don't know how to forget
I used to wear your Timbs around the house when you left
And if you had an open soda, I would finish the rest
Pretend I'm older, I like the liquor odor you left
Then put your camouflage vest on like I'm holding a tec
Then point it at the mirror like I'm holding your rep
Through that mirror wasn't me, but it was you I reflect
Wanted to be like you, jail tat on the chest
With the rugged cornrows and a stab on my neck

I'll rob shit like that you know
Cause I'll rob anybody, I, I don't care
It was a 9 to 5 for me, you know
It was like a hobby to me, I was the gunman
I was the dancer, entertainer, you know what I mean? I did it all
Like I said I had a death wish, I'll rob anybody
Ay, hold up motherfucker, you see I'm talking, right?!",https://genius.com/A-ap-ferg-psycho-lyrics
Back Hurt,Always Strive and Prosper,2016,"I'm a lucky bastard, my car like Dukes of Hazzard
I never had a ghostwriter, I'm afraid of Casper

Big bowl of money, I look like big bowl of money
Got a Tommy on the Kawasaki, blowing out an onion
Takeoff Frank Lucas, I got 'em itching
They addicted to Bobby and Mr. Whitneys
And they drinking on Actavis what a feeling
Momma told me drink water, flush out my kidney
I'm a lucky bastard, dab, ooh, dagger
Your bitch a happy camper got an iPhone she a snapper
I know some rappers but know some more trappers
They got more money than you rappers
Talk like that actor you smoking tobacco
My Louboutins stomp you out like I'm a Kappa
I’m gonna do my dab like the Heisman
I wanna coach, I’m Quavo O'Ryan
Look at the feds I know that they spying
I'm gonna disappear like I'm the Mayans
Hop in my rocket I bet they can't find me
Fuck all that bullshit and stop with this nonsense
These Benjamins and Jacksons got something in common
All of my niggas about money and violence
For real, for real, for real, this territory shit is real
Fuck how a nigga gon' feel, I'm just gripping on the steel
Think I might go in Beverly Hills
Get a mansion about 28 M's
No Jack and Jill but I done been on the hill
Count it then I pop a seal

I'm a lucky bastard, my car like Dukes of Hazzard
I never had a ghostwriter, I'm afraid of Casper

Monday up in Magic City
Sucking on them tig ol' bitties
Diamonds dancing on me like they Diddy
I've been feeling gritty but I'm looking pretty
I been popping bitches like I'm Pretty Ricky
Got a bad bitch and her name is Nicki
She be with the ménage and come from Philly
Yeah, swear that my father's killing me
All of these racks breaking my back
These dollars signs is crippling me
Yeah, I look in her eyes I'm an enemy
I come from the trap, my niggas attack
You won't recognize your family

I'm a lucky bastard, my car like Dukes of Hazzard
I never had a ghostwriter, I'm afraid of Casper
I fucked her one time, then my homie fucked right after

I’m tryna make a dollar, get my ass up out of Harlem
Cause you know the haters watching and the bullets ain’t cool
Ain’t you, attracted to a powerful motherfucker
Don't wanna be compared to these rapper dude motherfuckers
Who turnin' so passionate when they battling motherfuckers
But never get a crib up in Malibu motherfucker
And I don’t want to wind up like him
He can't afford that Tom Ford, you won’t like that man
Grinding that old food, no AC or fan
No trips to Jamaica, babe you gets no tan
I wanna pull up pull up in a 4-4 or Benz
A Sprinter van, with the TVs in
Your crew jump in, I’m getting those jeans
If we keep on, fuckin’ fly to Japan
You say that this shit mami, ‘cause you my girl
You say you just need me and need no one else
But I'm full of ambition to take over the world

Funny how it all go go, you never could know though
What happened to Tiger was Kobe, you know hoes
Get caught in a photo, lipstick on your polo
And all the trust that you builds right out the door door
Y’all went from lovebirds to looking like Dodos
And that shit gon’ last, for months it’ll go go
And that shit gon’ drag, drag on like Komodo
Over a bitch that look like Quasimodo, god!
Now you calling and checkin' in
All the time like your ass still on parole though
Wondering if you just better off solo
You paying a price, but is that what it owe though?
Praying up to god about shit that’s not even holy
You like “she tripping over bitches saying that they know me”
Then she put the pussy on me, swear that shit control me
That shit control me, man that shit control me

She tried to tell me that the world is mine

Let You Go,Always Strive and Prosper,2016,"She questioned my lyrics
My love for your music is bittersweet every time that I hear it
Your great-sounding art helped build my walls
And pushes me away so I won't fall
I'm thinking in my head ""shit, oh my lord""
She texted me last night with all my faults
Downloaded your mixtape, it sound so good
But why you gotta say things that make me sound so small?
You talking 'bout your experience with other women
How you think that be looking?
My daddy and whole family hearing
Where's the respect? I don't feel it
And if you lose me, would you fear it?
Would you take back the silly acts that you was sharing?
About how you deceived and cheated with no caring
The honesty in your music is fucking overbearing
I feel you, babe, I understand where you coming from
Just hear me out, just understand where I'm coming from
I'm not dumb, I know what I write
I don't wanna hurt you and I hate to fight
I'm conscious of everything I recite
Cleanse the soul through fingertips when I write
I don't really know if it's wrong or right
I feel like God put me here to shed the light

But I don't ever wanna let you go
'Cause when the smoke clears, you'll still be here
Through the pain and the tears
All these years
But I don't ever wanna let you go
'Cause when the smoke clears, you'll still be here
Through the pain and the tears
All these years
You ride for me
You lie for me
You would die for me
And you cry for me
But I don't ever wanna let you go
'Cause when the smoke clears, you'll still be here
Through the pain and the tears
All these years

My open letter to my girl who got my back
Who's affected by the real shit in my raps
What's that name of the song, the Jay Z track?
I was just fucking them girls, I was gon' get right back
Still tryna figure my place in this world
Ain't mean to hurt the heart of my beautiful girl
See, I talk about the real so my niggas'll learn
Try give 'em motivation so my niggas'll earn
So I talk about how I shine and fuck on dimes
Rolling in the Maybachs, seats reclined
I know it sounds kinda harsh when I speak 'bout mine
And you'll be crying in the dark and wanna leave sometime
But I don't ever wanna let you go
'Cause when the smoke clears, you'll still be here
Through the pain and the tears
All these years

But I don't ever wanna let you go
'Cause when the smoke clears, you'll still be here
Through the pain and the tears
All these years
But I don't ever wanna let you go

My high heel shoes from a Sunday mornin' service""

Street name was Sterlin, smell like shit, vomit, urine
When my bitches come over they have the look of concerning
Like why he stand in the hallway with a milk carton and be lurking?
Why he jumping for joy when the whole building was just burning?
What about that nigga’s sash? Wore the socks on his hands
Purple coats in the summer, with the Glock in his pants
And he stabbed his own mama, how you do that to your fam?

Teach your kid how to eat and teach your kid how to farm
Watch what you put in your body so you can live it long
Mind, body, and soul in tact, proud and you strong
This rap ain't no lap it's more like a marathon
This track ain't no track just something I set it on
Live life in harmony, put love in your arms
Forgive to receive the blessing of peace and calm
Just a product of Malcolm X and Farrakhan
Martin Luther and Marvin Gaye came all to do a ghetto song

Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
People, people, people, people
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
People, people, people, people

Beautiful people can be defined by
Her hair, her eyes, her body
Beautiful people
Beauty is behind the surface
It is the soul, the spirit
That lies beneath the soul, the skin
It is the power of that beauty that holds us
That strengthens us
It is the way we dance when we wanna cry
It is our mind that creates the definition of the beauty
Clear your mind, clear your body
Reach for the strength within
We are all beautiful people

All my beautiful people, all my beautiful people
I'm the ghetto apostle, come on, follow I'll lead you
Tell them put down the pipes, liquor bottles, and needles
Treat your family right, your mommy and daughter need you
Grandma, auntie and cousin, OG told you about thuggin'
But he ain't amount to nothing, he on top of that oven
Then on top of that corner his little niggas be drummin'
Blicka-blocka they buck then they finna hit you with somethin'
Jack-o'-lantern with him as they finna open your pumpkin
Popping your collar pimping and this ain't nothin' 'bout stuntin'
If you ain't talking thuggin' then you ain't talkin' 'bout nothin'
Bullshit, I'm the pope, I think I am onto something
I wanna empower people, wanna empower people
White, purple and yellow, and all of my browner people
We can be positive, don't let negativity kill you
First start with your friends then move a whole town of people",https://genius.com/A-ap-ferg-beautiful-people-lyrics
Grandma,Always Strive and Prosper,2016,"Ugh

All I ever wanted was a minute with my grandma
I would tell her how I made it, listen to me grandma
Security wasn't workin', he failin' his job
He look at God
And I got a call from Universal like ""hey this Ferg?""
But Rocky told me if them labels call just curve
I'm sittin' here like ""damn Rocky you got nerves""
He got us this far so I'ma trust his word
Then  call me, ""What's up homie?
Got a deal for you like two milli'""
When Rocky asked get money
Too much money, this half only
Two mill', two mill', I don't know
Grandma, I ain't lie
Then Geno called like 
Got a deal for us like three milli' at Polo Grounds
That label deal A$AP Worldwide, this shit unreal
Now we signed signed it
Grandma, now we signed it
Wish you was here to smell this air
And I could touch your pretty hair
We could talk for two more years
Push you around in your wheelchair
Momma say hi
""Hey mother, dear""
Your birthday on Christmas
And we shed a tear like every year
Celebratin' your happy years
Hopin' that your spirit clear
When  feel it you can touch my nose and brush your clothes
Light flickerin' from the chandelier
You see she blew that candle near
What you don't know you shall feel
But I know my grandma, I ain't scared

Grandma
I'm talkin' 'bout my grandma
Grandma
Grandma
Talkin' 'bout my grandma
Grandma

Grandma ain't gotta go through pain no more
Arthritis and pain and sores
Bleedin' red, they paint your gauze
Many nights you pray to God
Lord help me, I can no more, I can't endure this pain no more
What about my husband? He want more
Can't stand up cook, can't stand at all
Times I heard 'em down that hall
""I heard you down that hall""
It was times I heard 'em down that hall
""I heard you down that hall""
Don't be slick you fucked that neighbor
Tell me lies, you tell me fables
""You really think I'm stupid?""
 I hate you
Take advantage, I'm disabled
What about time I fixed your table
All of them times filled your naval
Coulda had a guy that fixed that cable
But I know you and I love you
Yeah I love you, you spoiled motherfucker
Fuck them other bitches sucker
Let them other bitches love ya, bitch
I'm good and know my kid love me
The only reason why I still really wanna breathe
Even though you love me unconditionally
And I understand the circumstance when it come to me
(I'm sick)

I'm talkin' 'bout my grandma

You ain't recalling what you claiming to be

You talking about me in the streets and I don't like it
You running with them people I don't like it
If she ain't got no cheeks I don't like it
She ain't bringing no freaks I don't like it

No face, no case, dab, no face, no case, dab
D-Brown these hoes, dab, D-Brown these hoes, dab

Setting up that hook, jab, setting up that hook, jab

French, Ferg, and who? Fab, came back with a new bag
Frank Lucas blue bag, came through coupe black
Uppercut, two jabs, paid for, two stacks
LV's, no strap, hearing them, who that

My bitch is too bad, her booty is too fat
The new 2 Live Crew, dag, me, French, and who? Fab
Goyard my boo bag, Dior my shoes, damn
Iced out my tooth and I Baped out my durag

From BX to Harlem, ending up in BK
You don't want no problem, cook beef like cheesesteak
On me so freaky, ella dice dique
Balling on some new shit, this NBA 3K

Still go to the PJ's, fuck a bitch where she stay
Can't come to the new crib, she ain't getting no leeway
Probably fucked your new bitch, don't believe what she say
But the bitch a klepto, I seen my shit on eBay

If you want me to blow the bag, I don't mind
If you want to come fuck my swag I don't mind
All through the night (I don't mind)
I said all through the night (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
If you want me to blow the bag I don't mind
If you want to come fuck my swag I don't mind
All through the night (I don't mind)
I said all through the night (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Put 40 on my neck, and 20 on her wrist
Black card in her ass, and you can sweat like this
She in love with my crew, but I don't give two shits
And I ain't wear no vest Fab, you can snipe my bitch

Blowing up my phone, wow, showing up to my home, wow
How I'm posed to stop, how, stop acting crazy, how
Whip on my wrist, wow, whipping my wrist, wow
Got me popping that Crystal, like its '96 now

I pull up out that pussy tell her hold up
Pull up to the club getting paid like a promoter
We pull niggas throw up, you got a bad bitch, I got 30 of those
Red bottoms cost 30 Jordans

If you want me to blow the bag I don't mind
If you want to come fuck my swag I don't mind
All through the night (I don't mind)

Rebirth,Always Strive and Prosper,2016,"If I die before I wake
At least I lived life my way
Hope that you remember me
Came up fast, bittersweet
Please prepare me mentally
‘Fore you take my soul and empty me

Now that you’re no longer a lord that’s trapped
You have graduated to the Hood Pope
You have made it to represent your people
Show them another way
Be the voice of the people who couldn’t make it out the hood

Make sure my family good, my ma still in the hood
I ain’t rich like they think cause I copped me one mink
They think I got me a house with a big couch and a gold sink
With a model bitch with a gold ring, big ass fish in a fish tank
Haha, you laughing, just put me in my casket
I ain’t even into nagging, it's what it is, I’m passing

And though times is hard now, your success awaits them
I’m no different, we all the same
Ferg made it out? Well, I can play that game
You’re not exempt from the growing chain
Niggas forget who’s afraid to change
Yet a trapped lord, I will remain

Hood Pope, I’ma teach these confused folks how to maneuver
Through folks and attention, get you choked, you know
Slim model girls sniffing the coke
Fiend on the block sniffin’ the dope
I wanna help, I don’t know, tell me the, antidote
How you hood and a pope
Conscious thinking, ghetto though
I’ll teach you how to build a grow tree
Life like a bike and pedal slow

Now you’re the voice of the guys on the corners
And the kids who have no direction, guide them
Through the trials and the tribulations
Teach them the world can be accumulated with patience

If I die before I wake
At least I lived life my way
Hope that you remember me
Came up fast, bittersweet
Please prepare me mentally
‘Fore you take my soul and empty me",https://genius.com/A-ap-ferg-rebirth-lyrics

A lifetime supply of Adidas
Sneaker deal, getting Franklins like Aretha
Uncle did fifteen, still got him a visa
He got through Canada, next year is Ibiza
Oh now my Twitter fingers working
Album about to drop, had to warn 'em before I murk 'em
Kirk Knight on the beat (Kirk Knight)
Feel these vibrations through your feet
It's like a bad bitch with some bad toes
Cause I never felt defeat
And I never had to reach
Put in work the elite will fuck with me
I know y'all seen the Kanye tweet
Just as long as Jay and Kanye peep
Haha, that's fine with me
In time the world is mine, you'll see
I call Khaled for the motivation
He hit me with the cloth talk, he told me get some patience
I know I'm ill but I'm steady waiting
Already cooked the album up but I'm still baking

Kirk Knight on the beat right
All night, alright
Yeah
Come on, come on

Third year at Coachella
Phlegm still in my chest, I'm going gorilla
Flacko tell you how they did him, he sounded so fed up
Fergie here and next week we doing mo' better
Should have hit 'em with Work and Shabba
I better, New Levels and do it proper
I probably do strive and start to gossip
Bring Missy out, I'll probably bring Diddy out
Man I'm repping New York, they'll probably bring the city out
Probably get Janet Jackson to pull her whole titty out
Breakfast with a billionaire, Turkey Bacon at Diddy's house
I could have fucked my life up with the Bobbi and Whitney route
God bless 'em them drugs is a weapon
Yammy was so high that I had to learn my lesson
Man I came a long way from depression
To dealing with oppression, to higher upsetting
Trump win, I'm flying off the soil
I'm going back to where they treat us royal
All this fuckin' bullshit make my blood boil
Just know that I'll put it all on the line for ya

Ride with the mob, Alhamdulillah
Check in with me and do your job
Ferg is the name, Ben Baller did the chain
Tourneau for the watch, presi Plain Jane

Yamborghini chain, rest in peace to my superior
Hermès link could feed a village in Liberia
TMZ taking pictures, causin' mad hysteria
Momma see me on BET and started tearin' up
I'ma start killin' niggas, how you get that trife?
I attended Harlem picnics where you risked your life
Uncle used to skim work, sellin' nicks at night
I was only 8 years old, watching Nick at Nite
Uncle Psycho was in that bathroom buggin'!
Knife to his guts, hope Daddy don't cut him
Suicidal thoughts brought to me with no advisory
He was pitchin' dummy, sellin' fiends mad ivory
Grandma had the arthritis in her hands, bad!
She was poppin' pills like rappers in society
I fuck yo bitch for the irony
I'll send Meechy at yo ho if yo bitch keep eyein' me

I'ma explain why you probably never seen me
I'm in a sunken place, no Instagram, I'm watchin' TV
I think I trade my breakfast, lunch, and dinner for some kitty
Please believe me, I see RiRi, I'ma eat it like panini
I go dumb up in the broad, hit the walls like graffiti
Indian burns all up on a nigga wee-wee
I think I need a foursome, Bella, Kendall, Gigi
It'd be easy if Reneezy hook it all up on the leezy
I go crazy in my Yeezy, Kirk Kneezy on the beat
I told 'em now we finna glow up in the street
Rappers talk subliminal but they don't talk to me
Put 'em in a Jersey shore like Pauly D

What Do You Do,Still Striving,2017,"[Chorus: NAV &

What do you want? Cut my grass low, see the snakes, all in my lawn
Tell me what you want, got a party inside my trunk
What do you want? All my haters mad that I'm on
A$AP with XO, tell me what else do you want?
What do you want? Is it a car, with the stars?
Tell me what you want, what do you want?
What do you want? XO with A$AP, tell me what else do you want?

She lickin' the tip, she put it on her tongue
She smokin' my dick, she coughin' up her lung
Please don't run, please don't run
She open her leg, I eat that thing for lunch
I get in her zone, I give her the bone, I tell her, ""Let's have fun""
A couple of rounds, a five to four to three to two to one
They come to my house, that booty bounces like it's three to one
Feelin' my touch, fuckin' that bitch and she's lickin' my nuts
It's no love, ridin' that coupe 'cause she's fillin' my life
Baby, it's my life, snakes in that grass and I tell you no lie
You ride or die, tonight
Don't tell me no lie, look in my eye

Try to diss me and take my lean, you won't go far
Got an ounce and the hammer inside my Goyard
Went from raw papers to smokin' by the jar
Just 'cause it's Japanese don't mean that that's a foreign car
Growin' up in Southside Rexdale wasn't fun
Giuseppe walkin', know some people on the run
Shouldn't have a clean record with the shit I've done
I won't say shit 'cause I know how to bite my tongue
I flew Frost to L.A. when he landed, get whatever he want
I'm smokin' by the pound, with him, I'm smokin' by the ton
Gave him a diamond chain 'cause I'ma make another one
Switch your girl, she saw me in a Ghost, I asked her what she want

I go hard, won't ever settle
""Go in for the kill"" what they taught me
Boy I'm movin' that Shark Tank
In this bitch like I'm Clark Kent
Got a deal with the devil like y'all say
It's for the love of the money, what y'all think?
Fuck a wack bitch what I won't do
Make a bill with these vocals
And the Pro Tools, thought I told you
Pedal or metal, I try to slow down but I can't
Fuckin' yo bitch and she kissin' the dick
And I'm startin' to feel like I'm Tank
Chasin' the commas on commas
Embracing the drama that come with the fame
Put that on my momma, the llama’ll
Hit ya designer and pardon your brain, so stay in ya lane

I bust in her mouth cause she parched
She throwin' it back with an arch
You cuffin' that bitch like a narc

Two birds on my boat, I'ma start

Ask around, I'm intercontinental
I was in the rental with a seven
No concealing, you can see my weapon
Count a million, never see me stressin'
Ten or better, never any lesser
Who you know got it like I do?
I know the trap and I know survival
I already killed your main bitch
Tell her best friend she could die too (Ahh)
Only foreign when we slide through, huh
I blew a check on the fit
Look at my neck and my wrist
I wanted a million before I hit thirty
So now I can flex in the whip
What are you on? I ride with a bomb
You gon' think Flex in the whip
I got respect off the rip
I got no respect for a snitch (No)
I'm talkin' incredible shit (Yes)
This Sprite got a medicine twist
It ain't hard to tell that we rich

I feel like Olympian, I'm runnin' now
'Cause I'm runnin', runnin', runnin' to the money now
I be gunnin', put the dick up in her tummy now
She in love with the crew, she with my buddies now
I feel like Olympian, I'm runnin' now
'Cause I'm runnin', runnin', runnin' to the money now
I be gunnin', put the dick up in her tummy now
She in love with the crew, she with my buddies now

Used to say I dressed so strange
Now I'm in the Wang, campaign
Jiggy, ain't a damn thing changed
'Bout to cop Cam, pink Range
Huh, yeah, I'm on a new level
Certified gold, at work with platinum
Already put mama in the house
Now it's time to build Fergie a mansion
Pelle jacket with the Trap Lord
In the back of the Marc Buchanan
I was nine in Versace
Wore Gucci with the Vans then
Used to Harlem Shake with the big shirts
Now my diamonds do the dancin'
My life is a movie, Steven Spielberg, Ferg
Nigga, light, camera, action
Mackin' bitches from a pageant, put that pussy in a casket
Tell Serena that I love her, fuckin' on my tennis racket
I could live in her palace, prolly put her in some Palace
But I'd prolly fuck it all up with a 
Love & Hip Hop
 ratchet
Huh, now I'm a loner, fuck 'round and blame it on Mona
Rich but I still love me a hood Dominican bitch with a Corona
Flexin' with a Tec and all the weapons
, that is not your persona
My flow is hotter than a sauna, makin' all you rappers bipolar

I feel like Olympian, I'm runnin' now
'Cause I'm runnin', runnin', runnin' to the money now
I be gunnin', put the dick up in her tummy now
She in love with the crew, she with my buddies now
I feel like Olympian, I'm runnin' now
'Cause I'm runnin', runnin', runnin' to the money now
I be gunnin', put the dick up in her tummy now

Tango,Still Striving,2017,"Makin' money for the long term
Off of these words
Yeah, give me one more, one more
We're gettin' more and gettin' more
We gotta get more, yeah
Make a dollar out of these words
And I'm just tryna find the real words
So I try to find an angle
Yeah I try to find another angle
So we can tango
I try to find another angle
So I try to find another angle
So we can tango with these words
So we can tango with these words
Yeah, real life
Ain't nothing like real life events
Now talk to 'em, yeah

Just found out my daddy died for the wrong reasons
Wasn't the the kidney that took him, it was the bad treatment
Ain't go to court because our heart was still bleedin'
Family grievin', no money could fix the pain that we feelin'
Lil' nice, done leveled up, you wouldn't believe it
And my momma always reflect when I was younger teethin'
Now it's gold grills glisten every time the teeth in
And all my idols listen every time I'm speakin'
Timbaland and Missy lose it when I load the beat in
My life a party, everyday is a weekend
I swear my whole life changed last weekend
But this game strange, it'll throw you off the deep end
Speak to Yams' mom on the daily, beautiful lady
Feelin' of her losing her baby drivin' her crazy
She say that I remind her of her son
She make arroz con pollo and cook every time I come
I get the 'itus, she tell me to go sleep in his bed
And maybe some of Yams' visions come to your head
Life's a dream, momma knew that I was somethin' special
Never settled, tunnel vision, pedal to the metal
Momma in first class, she actin' all boujetto
Now it's PBS specials, thought I was too ghetto
Singin' Christmas carols with Miss Universes
She slide me her number, you know Fergie gon' put the work in
Re-real life, I be livin' out my verses
Reflect when Dove ran out, I used detergent
The one you clean dishes with
And now we at award shows all gettin' lit now

Sometimes I like to tango, tango around these words
Dance all around these words
If I don't speak, it might get worse
If I don't speak, it might get worse
Sometimes I like to tango, tango around these words
If I don't speak it might get worse
I'ma dance all around these words
If I don't speak, it might get worse
Sometimes I like to tango

Sometimes I like to tango dancin' with these words
But I can't accept my thoughts so it's gettin' worse
I gotta let it out or my brain'll burst
I'm busy tourin' so I can't go to church
The only option is put it in the verse
Express it to my fans so they be alert
Yeah, Fergie put in work, Fergie put in work
I wonder if I gave it up, would I miss the perks?
Would I miss the groupie hoes with the short skirts?
Would I miss these rapper niggas? Nah they all jerks
Some I came up with, don't desire to speak to
Fake hugs and love every time when they see you
They scream ""R.I.P. Yams"" and that's just to please you
But his mom know what it is, just know that we see you
I got the heart of a lion and the eye of a eagle
I gotta speak the real, it ain't no time to tango

Sometimes I like to tango, tango around these words
Dance all around these words
If I don't speak, it might get worse
If I don't speak, it might get worse
Sometimes I like to tango, tango around these words
If I don't speak it might get worse
I'ma dance all around these words
If I don't speak, it might get worse
Sometimes I like to tango

Dance all around this words
If I don't speak, it might get worse
If I don't speak, it might get worse
Sometimes I like to tango, dance all around these words
Dance all around this words

Bir trap ile büyük bir hayal
Sert gidiyorum, asla durmayacağım
Bana öğrettikleri ""öldürmek için gir"" idi
Dostum bu köpekbalığı havuzunda dolaşıyorum
Bu orospunun içindeyim Clark Kent gibi
Şeytan ile anlaşmam var hepinizin dediği gibi
Bu para aşkı için, siz ne sandınız?
Bu kaçık fahişeyi becer ki yapmayacağım bir şey
Ve pro tools, sana söylediğimi düşünmüştüm
Pedal veya metal, yavaşlamaya çalışıyorum ama yapamam
Fahişeni sikiyorum ve siki öpüyor
Ve Tank gibi olduğumu hissetmeye başlıyorum
Para üstüne para kovalıyorum
Ünle gelen dramayı kabulleniyorum
Annemin üstüne bahse girerim ki, silah

Ağzına boşalıyorum çünkü susuz kalmış
Kavis ile siki geri atıyor
İspiyoncuymuş gibi tokatlıyorsun
Ooh oğlum başlamak istemiyorum
İki kuş botumda, başlayacağım
Nuhun gemisi gibiyim

Senin imzaların için vaktim yok
Senin kafanı dart gibi hedef aldım

In and out with a shawty, she beat me for actin' naughty
And my daddy, my daddy, he a savage
Fuckin' bitches, the baddest and buyin' whips to just crash 'em
And my uncles, my uncle, one name is Psycho
T-Nice cooked the white slow, thank God he ain't do life though
And my grandmas, my grandma, one hit the hammer
One and them dressed like Hammer and was an African dancer

Family tree
Yeah, family tree
Bring it back
Yeah, family

I hate it when my mama curse me out in the public
My daddy had the silver mink matchin' the Benz
T-Nice introduced me to some killers for friends
And Pschyo was a Pschyo with a deuce in his Timbs
My grandma had the arthritis, holdin' the hammer (Yeah)
She kept it in the mattress, kept my unc' out the slammer
The other had a caesar with some pants like Hammer
She kick her legs up, she a African dancer

Family tree
Yeah, family tree
Yeah, family

Life's a tightrope, the fam give me balance
With me as I climb the mountains of the rich and the the famous
Grandma, holy moly, she dancin', I see Marcus Garvey on the wall and say ""damn it
Who he starin' at?"" My grandma say, ""Lord of the planet""
You can tell she is a fan of the Black Panthers
T-Nice ran with a posse, only do damage (Right)
That's what I'm sayin', drug game like a cancer
He was wearin' pandas, minks coats, now he in the slammer (Yeah)
And I can't stand her like ""Dirty Diana"" (Right)
Life's a bitch, you's my grandma, grandma
My fathers cross cost an arm and a hammer (Right)
People think they broad is all from Atlanta (Yeah)
Was never home and showed up to be Santa (Ah)
I used to hang out with gang bangers like Santana that wear bandanas
And red clothes with pit bulls, the red nose
Keep the ""Smith &"" if you slippin', you got rich, just let me get it

You leave me with a big neck scratch when I hit it from the back
Pillow under your stomach‚ you like it like that
They catch you half-sleep so you can't fight that
We go for hours‚ fuck in the shower, pussy devour
Foreplay in the kitchen, bend it over the counter (Mm)
You taste like candy‚ I eat it like Sour Power
You be likin' it rough, your body soft as a flower (Yeah)
And when we finish, you be holding me (

Got your head on my chest‚ you consoling me (

Quick to close the blinds when I'm hitting that
But I'm hoping you leave it open, so they know it's me (Damn)
From the beginning, you said it was mine
And I can tell the way you said it that you weren't lying
You see me text her (
Yeah

And I can still feel the tingle up and down my spine

I'm in a dream, fairy tale, fantasy when you're around me (Ooh)
I must be losing my mind
Dream, fairy tale, fantasy when you're around me (Ooh)
I must be losing my mind

You know you belong to me
You can bring your whole squad plus three
You don't like to get told what to do
But you like it when I put you on a leash
All fours for me, on the floor for me
Have you scratching walls, parkour for me
And every night, I'll hit it right
I'ma bring you on tour with me (Yeah)
You the one for me
And even if you're wrong for me
It's a good mistake, even when I'm wide awake

Why you so reckless? Why you won't play?
Are you talkin' to the nigga with the grown-ass face?
You don't even vibe with the homie
You can't even lie to me, no way

Diamond Dust,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Diamond Dust oooo it's so cold
She don't feel her face, and he don't feel his nose
D-D-D-Diamond Dust It'll leave you cold
Where yo body heat? Ooo now his feet is swoll
D-D-D-Diamond Dust, Living in this cold world
Fuckin with that China White, Ooo that's his old girl
Lookin for that new bitch, to make his toes curl
Dope bitch, fucking up his whole world!

I'm so high as fucking hell, That I can kiss the sky
The Devil tryna grip me, I can hear the angels cry
That's my momma and my auntie screaming ""You just a bunch of lies""
And my girl just caught me stealing, I just bought her the new iPhone
Drugs are my new friends and they just getting tall
My boss just caught me beaming, so you know that I got fired
And my clothes is getting old and my hair used to be wavy
Shit, this the life of crack, when you growing up in the 80’s
And I’ve been smoking, Lord please help
Cause I’m going out of my mind
I can hear my heart beat, think I’m running out some time
Where do I go from here, do I lay here and just die?
I can see pearly gates, matter fact I’ve just changed my mind
I don’t wanna go, go, think I’m going out of my mind
I can hear my heart beat, think I’m running out some time
Where do I go from here, do I lay here and just die?
I can see pearly gates, matter fact I’ve just changed my mind

Hi my name is Becky, and I used to wanna be famous
I sniffed away my brains, and the itches make me insane, oh
And I used to hang with Dana, used to party with the Lakers
Used to travel with the Indiana Pacers
I used to wanna cheer but they didn't wanna take us
Cause now I'm faded, now my whole world is jaded
Damn I thought I made it, living out my dreams
But this whole time I was faking
I was faking
And this is what that diamond does
And this is from that diamond dust
And this is from that diamond dust
And this is what that diamond does",https://genius.com/A-ap-ferg-diamond-dust-lyrics
How To Rob The Mob,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Feel like Fifty after them bullets had a party
All I want is revenge, these rappers getting hommied
We could get it shaking like Muhammed Ali
Might take a shot at myself like Pac in the lobby
But I will never shoot myself, no Cheddar Bobby
But I’m getting cheddar ‘cause my flow crack like Bobby
Not from Miami, but I roll with a shower posse
Teena and Kalani who’s pussy you’ll get Dasani
Two credit cards scheming bitches from Brooklyn, kinda grimey
Their pussy’ll get wet if you’re even talking about money
Flatbush finest, your royal highness
We supposed to be scheming, but them bitches stay the highest
Bitch, why don’t you pay attention to the plan?
First you can get Nast ugly ass then go after Yams
And Addy think he a gun boy so I’m gon’ watch his hand
And Dominic Lord was his best friend so I’m gon’ watch his man
He got kicked out of A$AP early on ‘cause he was schemin’
Telling record exec’s he started this, you wouldn’t believe it
I stay on top of my game, my foot stay in the pivot
And Bron Bron still a don you other niggas was cheatin’
Bumping y'all gum, you little niggas is teethin’
Spit Miami Heat and you little niggas is steamin’
Tell Rocky that I’m cocky, I’m going off for no reason
Twelveyy going off for no reason
Y’all might hate me, I’m going out with no treason
No, I don’t smoke, don’t hand me no trees then
Don’t care about molly, don’t give a fuck about leanin’
Just wanna throw bullets, I’m feeling like Willy Beamen

40 Below,UnKnown,UnKnown,"It's cold in the winter, baby
And I don't know when I'm coming home
The moon is shine, under the sun
Let me walk, you can run
Something tells me you're not the one
Maybe you just don't understand
So why you wonder where I keep my gun
It's in my 40 Below's

I like chicks in spandex and 
lumberjacks
No hat to match
, 
razorblade in the doobie rack
Just in case a bitch act, she get her wig pushed back
Catch a fucking bullet like Warren Sapp
Cause she stay with the mac, and fuck a backpack
She rather roll up on 5-6 and headcrack
And her mom always catching fucking heart attacks
Talking 'bout, ""Fuck D Ferg, he ain't worth splat!""
Cause I dropped out of school and I drop slack
Missed work, gotta get up and hear my moms yap
Just 7.15 ain't doing it
Seeing niggas chrome-out 6, and they doing it
You see the street got corners and they using it
Momma told me not to be a fool and don't loose the shit
It's cold, 40 below, gun in the boot and shit
Ready start shooting shit, like I'm Bishop Juice'n it
And you don't want to end up like Steve
With steel to your grill because you didn't wanna fucking peel
Shit is real that I kick, I'm dead broke
Can't afford to smoke so I get high off of lead choke

Have you met Mr. Lee, oh, you gotsa meet her
Back shots off the meter and the hair adds to her features
She don't wear sneakers and she don't like reefer
Classy-ass bitch and she know when I kiss her
Love when I pull her hair low when I beat her
Hit it from the back and she sing like Aretha
First black nigga that she ever pursue
She loved my dick game, and chilling with the crew
It's true, we met back in junior high school
But didn't pursue to knocking boots, but she the truth
So I respect her, Beretta in the lever
Just in case a bitch is getting clever, however
She do what I tell her, 
make me a grilled cheese
She ask, ""Babe, swiss or mozzarella?""
 She 'bout tell her

Bang, bang, let a one squirt
Givenchy my body, Ksubi my colleagues
Versace, my eyelids, Yves Saint-Laurent me
Twelvyy in huaraches, and Margiela on Rocky
Yohji Yamamoto for Ty Nast and Ty Beats
Fuck bitches that's on me, wack bitches move kindly
Last niggas of a dying breed, yeah me, myself, and Irene
Nigga hear them sirens when that four-fif' and that nine squeeze
China bitch sip sake, while I chop that ass with that Tommy

Ridin' in the streets, uh

Ms. Meagan Meagan Good you looking good on the t.v screen
This movie making me sick I think I need some codeine
Dr-Dripping from the tub and make me zone into a dream
Where one day you'll become my wife and we'll maybe have some mini me's
Laying here drowsy, and it's hard for me to see
That I've become infatuated with your perfect T
And those perfect lips, and them ass cheeks
Come into my funeral before I past cease
Cause i'd rather be dead than not in your possession
I'll meet you after life in 1 second
To hell if she ain't fucking with me
Oh, to hell if she ain't fucking with me


Hell ain't what I thought it was I wanna come back
Raping all these hoes while the devil just laugh
And it's hot as fucking shit, hotter than when I got clashed
Fuck your worshiping these bitches you know god done slack
I wear wool patch with a gasoline hat
Top of the hill made a track but the money made back
That's the devil favorite song he wrote that shit until it finish
In-love with every second, and hopes the shit is finished
But the shit keep on spinning and spinning and spinning
And if I spray ""Rawr"" then a nigga catch feelings
A re-precaution crew, 6,000 deaths
And if I pick this gun its a thousand left nigga
