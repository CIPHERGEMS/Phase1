The Light,Like Water for Chocolate,2000.0,"Yeah, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-d-doo, diggy-doo, yo

There are times
When you'll need someone
I will be by your side
There is a light that shines
Special for you and me

I never knew a luh, luh-luh, a love like this
Gotta be somethin' for me to write this
Queen, I ain't seen you in a minute
Wrote this letter, and finally decide to send it
Signed, sealed, delivered, for us to grow together
Love has no limit, let's spend it slow forever
I know your heart is weathered by what studs did to you
I ain't gon' assault them, ‘cause I probably did it too
Because of you, feelings I handle with care
Some niggas recognize the light
But they can't handle the glare
You know I ain't the type to walk around with matchin' shirts
If relationship is effort I will match your work
I want to be the one to make you happiest
And hurt you the most
They say the end is near, it's important that we close
To the most high
Regardless of what happen, on Him let's rely

There are times
When you'll need someone
I will be by your side
There is a light that shines
Special for you and me

It's important we communicate
And tune the fate of this union to the right pitch
I never call you my bitch or even my boo
There's so much in a name and so much more in you
Few understand the union of woman and man
And sex and a tingle is where they assume that it land
But that's fly by night, for you in the sky I write
For in these cold Chi night's moon, you my light
If Heaven had a height, you would be that tall
Ghetto to coffee shop, through you I see that all
Let's stick to understandin' and we won't fall
For better or worse times, I hope to me you call
So I pray every day more than anything
Friends we'll stay as we begin to lay
This foundation for a family, love ain't simple
Why can't it be anything worth havin' you work at annually?
Granted we known each other for some time
It don't take a whole day to recognize sunshine

There are times
When you'll need someone
I will be by your side
There is a light that shines
Special for you and me

It's kind of fresh you listen to more than hip-hop
And I can catch you in the mix from beauty to thrift shop
Plus you shit pop when it's time to
Thinkin' you fresh, suggestin' beats I should rhyme to
At times when I'm lost I try to find you
You know to give me space when it's time to
My heart's dictionary defines you, it's love and happiness
Truthfully it's hard tryin' to practice abstinence
The time we committed love, it was real good
Had to be for me to arrive and it still feel good
I know the sex ain't gon' keep you
But as my equal, it's how I must treat you
As my reflection in light I'ma lead you
And whatever's right I'ma feed you
Digga-da, digga-da, digga-da, digga-digga-da-da
Yo, I tell you the rest when I see you; peace!

There are times
When you'll need someone
I will be by your side
There is a light that shines
Special for you and me

I'll take my chances
Before they pass
Pass me by, oh, darling
You need to look at the other side
You'll agree",https://genius.com/Common-the-light-lyrics
I Used to Love H.E.R.,Resurrection,1994.0,"A-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop
To the beat, y'all, and you don't stop
Yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
A-one, two, y'all, and you don't stop
A-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop
And to the beat Com Sense'll be the sure shot, come on

I met this girl when I was ten years old
And what I loved most, she had so much soul
She was old school when I was just a shorty
Never knew throughout my life she would be there for me
On the regular, not a church girl, she was secular
Not about the money, those studs was mic-checkin' her
But I respected her, she hit me in the heart
A few New York niggas had did her in the park
But she was there for me, and I was there for her
Pull out a chair for her, turn on the air for her
And just cool out, cool out, and listen to her
Sittin' on a bone, wishin' that I could do her
Eventually if it was meant to be, then it would be
‘Cause we related, physically and mentally
And she was fun then, I'd be geeked when she'd come around
Slim was fresh, joe, when she was underground
Original, pure, untampered, a down sister
Boy, I tell you, I miss her

A-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop
To the beat, y'all, and you don't stop
A-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop
A-one, two, y'all, and you don't stop
A-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop
A-Com Sense y'all, and you don't stop
A-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop
UAC, yo, we gotta be the sure shot

Now periodically I would see
Ol' girl at the clubs, and at the house parties
She didn't have a body, but she started gettin' thick quick
Did a couple of videos and became Afrocentric
Out goes the weave, in goes the braids, beads, medallions
She was on that tip about stoppin' the violence
About my people she was teachin' me
By not preachin' to me but speakin' to me
In a method that was leisurely, so easily I approach
She dug my rap, that's how we got close
But then she broke to the West Coast, and that was cool
Cause around the same time, I went away to school
And I'm a man of expandin', so why should I stand in her way?
She probably get her money in L.A
And she did stud, she got big pub, but what was foul
She said that the pro-black was goin' out of style
She said, ""Afrocentricity was of the past""
So she got into R&B, hip-house, bass, and jazz
Now black music is black music and it's all good
I wasn't salty she was with the boys in the hood
Cause that was good for her, she was becomin' well-rounded
I thought it was dope how she was on that freestyle shit
Just havin' fun, not worried about anyone
And you could tell by how her titties hung

A-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop
To the beat, y'all, and you don't stop
A-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop
A-one, two, y'all, and you don't stop
A-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop
And to the beat Com gotta be the sure shot
A-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop
If you don't check it, mm-mm, bust it, bust it

I might've failed to mention that this chick was creative
Once the man got to her, he altered her native
Told her if she got an image and a gimmick
That she could make money, and she did it like a dummy
Now I see her in commercials, she's universal
She used to only swing it with the inner-city circle
Now she be in the burbs, lookin' rock and dressin' hippie
And on some dumb shit when she comes to the city
Talkin' bout poppin' Glocks, servin' rocks and hittin' switches
Now she's a gangsta rollin' with gangsta bitches
Always smokin' blunts and gettin' drunk
Tellin' me sad stories, now she only fucks with the funk
Stressin' how hardcore and real she is
She was really the realest, before she got into showbiz
I did her, not just to say that I did it
But I'm committed (girl, he's committed) but so many niggas hit it
That she's just not the same lettin' all these groupies do her
I see niggas slammin' her and takin' her to the sewer
But I'ma take her back, hopin' that the shit stop
‘Cause who I'm talkin' about, y'all, is hip-hop

To the beat, y'all, and you don't stop
A-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop
Mainframe, yo, they gotta be the sure shot
A-yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
To the beat, y'all, and you don't stop
A-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop
A-one, two, Com Sense is gonna drop, haha

Glory,Selma (Music from the Motion Picture),2014.0,"One day when the glory comes
It will be ours, it will be ours
One day when the war is won
We will be sure, we will be sure
Oh glory
(Glory, glory) Ohh (Glory, glory)

Hands to the Heavens, no man, no weapon
Formed against, yes glory is destined
Every day women and men become legends
Sins that go against our skin become blessings
The movement is a rhythm to us
Freedom is like religion to us
Justice is juxtapositionin' us
Justice for all just ain't specific enough
One son died, his spirit is revisitin' us
True and livin' livin' in us,
 
resistance is us
That's why Rosa sat on the bus
That's why we walk through Ferguson with our hands up
When it go down we woman and man up
They say, ""Stay down"", and we stand up
Shots, we on the ground, the camera panned up
King pointed to the mountain top and we ran up

One day when the glory comes
It will be ours, it will be ours
One day when the war is won
We will be sure, we will be sure
Oh glory (glory, glory)
Ohh (glory, glory)

Now the war is not over, victory isn't won
But we'll fight on to the finish, and when it's all done
We'll cry glory (glory), oh glory (glory), oh (glory, glory)
We'll cry glory, oh glory, oh (glory, glory)

Selma is now for every man, woman and child
Even Jesus got his crown in front of a crowd
They marched with the torch, we gon' run with it now
Never look back, we done gone hundreds of miles
From dark roads he rose, to become a hero
Facin' the league of justice, his power was the people
Enemy is lethal,
 
a king became regal
Saw the face of Jim Crow under a bald eagle
The biggest weapon is to stay peaceful
We sing, our music is the cuts that we bleed through
Somewhere in the dream we had an epiphany
Now we right the wrongs in history
No one can win the war individually
It takes the wisdom of the elders and young people's energy
Welcome to the story we call victory
The comin' of the Lord, my eyes have seen the glory

One day when the glory comes
It will be ours, it will be ours
One day when the war is won
We will be sure, we will be sure
Oh glory
(Glory, glory)
Oh (glory, glory)
Oh glory
(Glory, glory)
Yeah (glory, glory)

When the war is won, when it's all said and done
We'll cry glory, oh glory (glory, glory)",https://genius.com/Common-glory-lyrics
Stay Schemin’,UnKnown,2012.0,"My motto is: Chicago, bitch
Everybody know you sweet, what the problem is
Don’t play dumb, I’m the one that acknowledged it
Son of a bitch, I imagine what your father is
She said, “How you make your opponent
The rapper of the moment?” His style, he don’t own it
Acting all hard when he hardly like that
You gon’ mess around and make me catch a body like that
Awwww, don’t do it
Cause every song you make, Joe, is really ho music
I heard you said you wasn’t a bitch because you sing
You a bitch because you cling like a bitch that’s eighteen
Can’t say my name but rap about a nigga’s wife
You so black and white, trying to live a nigga’s life
I’m taking too long with this amateur guy
You ain’t wet nobody, nigga, you Canada dry

Soft nigga. Make no mistake, I’m talking to Drake
It’s the remix. Rick Ross, Common, and that ho-ass nigga
No, man-to-man, don’t hide behind them other niggas
Nah, this man-to-man. You can’t run behind them man
This is some real man shit right here

Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
If you ain't running game
Say my name, say my name
You acting kinda shady
Why the sudden change?
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
If you ain’t running game
Say my name, say my name
You acting kinda shady
Better say my name",https://genius.com/Common-stay-schemin-lyrics
Love Is…,Be,2005.0,"How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
It's a place I got to be
Loving you is loving me
How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
Gotta reach that frequency
Loving you is loving me

Yeah, you know what love is
Even found it on the ground where the thugs live
My man had to dig deep to find his
Couldn't sleep cause on the real he had five kids
Live nig's, real niggas express and taste it
At crap games, black dames and big faces
Cases in court, fam' showing love and support
You and your baby's mom thought that love was a sport
As men we were taught to hold it in
That's why we don't know how 'til we're older men
If love is a place I'ma go again
At least now, now I know to go within
At times it can take ya for a spin
Heartbreak hotel then you're home again
I've seen love make a nigga soul pretend
Like a story that he don't want to end, yo

How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
It's a place I got to be
Loving you is loving me
How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
Gotta reach that frequency
Loving you is loving me

It's all love where we come from
In the hood love we was told to run from
That same hood where the guns sung
We holla love, hoping it'd become one
Crack got so many lives undone
From lack of love many hide, some run
I knew this girl with a son who dreamt of acting in plays
Demonstration with her man had her trapped in a maze
Trying to find herself again, much of that she'd have gave
Love can free us, to it some of us react as a slave
Funny, we love 'em more when they're relaxed in a grave
Wonder if a thug is raw, is he actin' afraid?
Everybody loves sun, why do I attract shade?
Heard of the love of money, but compassion it pays
Talk about it with my youth so she'd understand
What it is to be loved by a man

How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
It's a place I got to be
Loving you is loving me
How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
Gotta reach that frequency
Loving you is loving me

Some say that I'm a dreamer 'cause I talk about it often
Seen the hardest nigga soften wit' his homie in a coffin
We walk and stand in, fall in it
With the right companion we all in it
Mary sang a song about it, having broad limits
In the game of life, it's the scrimmage
Reminiscing on letters I wrote in my small days
A letter to the people, love always, yeah

How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
It's a place I got to be
Loving you is loving me
How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
Gotta reach that frequency

If I'ma do it, I gotta change the world through her

Demons and old friends, Pops, they hauntin' him

Aston Martin king, Luther with dreams
The young Denzel the way I move through scenes
I’m like a preacher that once was a fiend
A story of change that came with wings
Pretty as the skyline, the sky is my eyeline
Son of the most so from up high I shine
Suited in Prada, stay mellow like lala
Young, fresh, with dollars, ladies go gaga
I’m the cum-lada, top of the class
Black Wall Street so my stock will never crash
Given what I ask, pure religion and cash
From the windows that open, I’m raising my glass
Daylight beams, night life schemes
This is my inception, I’m writing my dreams
Immortal view of a star doing what I’m born to do
I see the blue sky, see the Lord's coming through

Ohh, in the sky we'll find the light
Ohh, ain't too high, we'll shine at night
Now we in the skies, blue skies
And we going higher, that's right

I wanted to be Run–D.M.C
The Lord put the blessing upon the MC

Open my eyes, yes sir this is what I'm made for
To go hard in the paint like D. Wade or

Red carpet magic, taking pictures with the president
Told him for health care, my music is the medicine
My name holds weight, I am never hesitant
Different state resident, this is hood elegance
SLS classic, pursuing my passion
NOVA Fashion, now I'm Oscar party crashing

Ohh, ain't too high, we'll shine at night
Now we in the skies, blue skies
And we going higher, that's right

Silhouettes of dreams that we had high, huh
Even now it don't seem so bad, ma
Close my eyes to see things in front of me
I'm gone now, imagine what I'm gonna be
Dirty to worthy, now I'm all wordy
My broad up in Paris
, looking all purty
Immortal view of a star doing what I'm born to do
I see the blue sky, see the Lord's coming through

Ohh, in the sky we'll find the light
Ohh, ain't too high, we'll shine at night
Now we in the skies, blue skies
And we going higher, that's right

I had these dreams in my head of an endless sphere
I could see it from my window
Wouldn't take that long to get me there
Keep running til' I can go
Remember the beautiful things that life could give me
Crazy how I'm the one
Could've been anywhere, but I'm sitting in the air
With the wheels up staring at the sun
Ohh, in the sky we'll find the light
Ohh, until high we'll shine at night

Cinderella fancy, but she still look hood
Butt naked in the kitchen flipping pancakes
Plus she trickin' off the dough that her man makes
We got our own handshake, her titties ain't fake
Fucking in the car cause we just can't wait
To get home, early in the morn' getting stoned
Pretty with her eyes low, money by her Bible
The type of bitch that B.I.G. said he would die for
Is the type that I ride and stay alive for
Tats on her back, looking all tribal
She know shoes like she know survival
Well put together, she weathered the storm
Seen her brother die so forever she's strong
Hear Beyonce's song and she gotta perform
Whether fucking or fighting: we getting it on

Ass is a weapon and it's hard to conceal it
Baby in one arm, the other is a skillet
Fried chicken, macaroni, raised on the back of Stony
Ghetto Prince, she's my Apollonia
Like chick that had the back of Tony, Montana
Reminded me a me of my, of my mama
Knowing the drama like she know when to joke
Steal a nigga's squares, not wanting me to smoke
I poke my head out of Benzes
My tweets is the streets that I know who my friends is

I notice all my flaws when it comes to writing rhymes
Subject matter be changing too quickly at times
So I keep it strictly 'bout dimes and stick to the story
Call me a pro in the pussy category
Had explicit experiences I shouldn't mention
For me, getting women turned from sport to addiction
Powerful women playing the roles of submission
Lawyers on leashes, congresswomen inflictin'
Pain onto my game, wanted and I'm sadistic
They liked it, they dyked it, devices twisted
'til I get a nice chick, to get me on some nice shit
Crib raising kids, Labrador behind the white fence
But I'm still single, looking for Cleopatra
African Queen, yo look at me, I'm a bachelor
Y'all niggas in trouble, keep your girls behind closed doors
Cross your fingers, be happy I haven't chose yours
She love glamour, bought her Vera Wang sandals
Valentino bags is my etiquette, my manors
Half hood half class, photographers' cameras
Caught us out there, the spotlight, hope she can handle this
She can join me, red carpet at my next non-profit

The Food,UnKnown,2004.0,"Yeah! It's been a long time comin'
You know what they say Kanye
Slow motion better than no motion

I walked in the crib, got two kids
And my baby mama late (uh oh! uh oh! uh oh!)
So I had to did, what I had to did
'Cause I had to get (duh-ough! duh-ough! duh-ough!)
I'm up all night, getting my money right
Until the blue and whites (po po! po po! po po!)
Now the money comin' slow, but a least a nigga know
Slow motion better than (no-oh! no-oh! no-oh!)

You love to hear the story, again and again
About these young brothers, from the 
City of Wind
Like juice and gin, in the city we blend
Amongst the hustle, titties and skin, fifties and rims
Y'all know the Sprewells and trucks that's detailed
Heartless females that wanna ride in 'em
Felt the Southside venom in raw hides and denim
Pimp minds collide with 'em, a system that tries victims
We livin' in, my man in the fast lane pivotin'
On the block white is selling like Eminem
On the block it jump off like Kim and 'em
On the block it's hot, you can feel it, in your skin and then
Shorties get the game but no instructions to assemblin'
Eyes bright, it seems like the fight is dim in 'em
Call my man Cuzo, like I'm kin to him
He tryin' to stay straight, the streets is bendin' him

I walked in the crib, got two kids
And my baby mama late (uh oh! uh oh! uh oh!)
So I had to did, what I had to did
'Cause I had to get (duh-ough! duh-ough! duh-ough!)
I'm up all night, getting my money right
Until the 
blue and whites
 (po po! po po! po po!)
Now the money comin' slow, but a least a nigga know
Slow motion better than (no-oh! no-oh! no-oh!)

It's all good in the hood, like rats in gyms
Throwbacks and Timbs, blacks and rims
Whether on ball courts or tires of all sorts
We never fall short, with us it's all Force like Air 1's
Some waves, some air guns, the days of the fair one is over for
Cats is colder than four below, with self I go toe to toe
Wondering if it's for the art or for the dough
Though I know to grow a nigga gotta learn to let go
Though I know the dough I got to bring back to the ghetto
Arrows on tarot cards pointin' to the grind
Po' livin' in more prisons, pointin' to my mind, shine the light up
Clench my fists tight, holdin' the right up
Freedom fight in dark gear for the years to get brighter
Situations, and jaws get tighter
My man trying to get his weight and height up, c'mon!

I walked in the crib, got two kids
And my baby mama late (uh oh! uh oh! uh oh!)
So I had to did, what I had to did
'Cause I had to get (duh-ough! duh-ough! duh-ough!)
I'm up all night, getting my money right
Until the blue and whites (po po! po po! po po!)
Now the money comin' slow, but a least a nigga know
Slow motion better than (no-oh! no-oh! no-oh!)

I, I know I could make it right
If I could just swallow my pride
But I can't run away or put my gun away
You can't front on me
I, no I can't let it ride
No, no, not tonight
See I can't run away or put my gun away
You can't front on me

Yeah, I break bread with thieves and pastors, OGs and masters
Emcees and actors that seize and capture
Moments like the camcorder
You ain't killin' it, yo that's manslaughter
Though paper can't change a man's aura
It can feed a man's daughter
I stand for the blue collar, on the side makin' a few dollars
Like Sam Jack they maneuver through drama like

I, I know I could make it right
If I could just swallow my pride
But I can't run away or put my gun away
You can't front on me
I, no I can't let it ride
No, no, not tonight
See I can't run away or put my gun away
You can't front on me

If I could just swallow my pride
But I can't run away or put my gun away

That's right He got - I got to take him off of here. That's right. I 
gotta
 take him off of here. 'Cause there's only one, and that's me, you understand? 'Fore all of that fightin', you understand? The sucker think he good, the sucker think he can whoop me. And I knew he can't whoop me, huh? Hey, boy, the nigga whole style is chump, you understand? When it comes to me, you understand?

For your nation, yeah (8x)
One two, yeah
Coming through, yeah
Fa' sho'
Ha, Com Sense, yeah
Southside, yeah
Niggas be outside, yeah
Now bust it out, Chi-Town

A bitch nigga with an attitude named Cube
Stepped to the Com with a feud
Now what the fuck I look like dissing a whole coast?
You ain't made shit dope since 
AmeriKKKa's Most
Wanted deceased from the Midwest to the East
On the dick of the East for your first release
Your lease is up at the crib, house niggas get evicted
In videos with white boys talking you get wicked
Natural born killa
, nigga you natural born God
Read, rich, got the nerve to say you rob
Hyprocrite, I'm filling out your death certificate
Slinging bean pies and St Ide's in the same sentence
Shoulda repented on the 16th of October
Get some beats besides George Clinton to rock over
Rap career is over, better off acting
What trouble I see in managing WC and Wack 10?
You backed into a four corner hustla
Lying on your dick, said you was fuckin her
Use higher learning, don't take my words out of 'text
Went from gangsta to Islam to the dick of Das EFX
It'll take the nation of millions to hold me back
From giving you mouth shots or hit with the pipe that Ralph got
Chris Tucker ain't around, it's your Friday, it was good
I wasn't salty, she was with the Boyz N the Hood

I see the bitch in you when you don't speak your mind
The bitch in you, looking me in my eyes lying
I see the bitch in you, to be hard, you trying
The bitch in you it's coming out (
BITCH!
)

The ump of this rap shit, Cube, I'm calling out
I break in and smack niggas that's in the Slaughterhouse
This ain't no East Coast, West Coast, none of the above
I'm from Chi, I went to Cali (and what?) niggas gave me love
There's a thin line between the fake and the real
Grafted-ass nigga, I see through your glass shield
Had skills once upon a time on this project, yo
I'm a have to wreck a HO'Shea
I heard a ho say you her favorite rapper
(So what?) so I had to slap her, uh
And violate you (you), a Muslim drinking brew (brew)
Your nigga ain't no Mack 10, he's a 22
I seen you (Mack 10), you ain't say shit in ATL
Cube, I like that diamond charm, I might cuff it, then sell-
It out, like you sold Kam and Threat
A year ago, you wasn't talking shit about the West
Guess you knew your shit was done 
plus the one got you cable
Hoo-bangin'? You ain't banging shit but the table
And the Circle MAAD ain't got no choice but to fight
Ain't none of y'all motherfuckers got a chance on the mic
Any time you come out, joe, I'ma talk about you
Until you let that bitch in you walk up out you
Any last words before I hit the switch?
From the immortal words of one: ""a bitch iz a...""

I see the bitch in you when you don't speak your mind
The bitch in you, looking me in my eyes lying
I see the bitch in you, simply hard, you trying
The bitch in you, for sho', it's coming out (
BITCH!

Sample
 & (Common)]
Faithful to the end
 (we got to be)
Faithful to the end
 (I want to be)
Faithful to the end
 (yes, it's for the people)
I'd like to be her very best friend
(God moves, yeah)

I was rollin' around, in my mind it occurred
What if God was a her?
Would I treat her the same? Would I still be runnin' game on her?
In what type of ways would I want her?
Would I want her for her mind or her heavenly body?
Couldn't be out gettin' bogus with someone so godly
If I was wit' her would I still be wantin' my ex?
The lies, the greed, the weed, the sex
Wouldn't be ashamed to give her part of my check
Wearin' her cross, I mean the heart on my neck
Her, I would reflect on the streets of the Chi'
Ride wit' her, 'cause I know for me she'd die
Through good and bad call on her like I'm chirpin' her
Couldn't be jealous 'cause other brothers worship her
Walk this earth for her, glory, I'm grateful
To be in her presence I try to stay faithful

Faithful to the end
Faithful to the end
Faithful to the end
I'd like to be her very best friend

He worked with her, she was his lady's best friend
Even if they don't try some ladies test men
And this was a test that was bigger than him
Some believe its the nature that is given to men
He had a good gig, a wife, a kid, a decent home
One reason or another couldn't find peace at home
She asked, ""Why do men always have to stray?""
He said, ""I'm bad, not as bad as Eric Benet""
""I used to take 'em out to eat but they wasn't really eatin'
Mighta got a little head but I wasn't really cheatin'""
It's hard when your lady don't believe what you say
And what you did in the past you gotta live with today
She asked if they could spend the night together
He thought, and said, ""I'm tryin' to get my life together""
Went home to his lady, these were his confessions
""Baby you a blessin' and my best friend""

Faithful to the end
Faithful to the end
Faithful to the end
I'd like to be her very best friend

Faithful to the end
Faithful to the end
I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be so faithful
I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be so faithful
So, so, so
So, so, so
So faithful
So, so, so
So, so, so
That's what I'm gonna do

That's what I'm gonna do

The Corner,Be,2005.0,"Memories on corners with the fo's and the mo's
Walk to the store for the rose, talking straightforward to hoes
Got uncles that smoke, and some put blow up they nose
To cope with the lows, the wind is cold and it blows
In their socks and their soles, niggas holding they rolls
Corners leave souls opened and closed, hoping for mo'
With nowhere to go, niggas rolling in droves
They shoot the wrong way, cause they ain’t knowin' their goals
The streets ain’t safe cause they ain’t knowing the code
By the foes I was told, either focus or fold
Got cousins with flows, hope they open some doors
So we can cop clothes and roll in a Rolls
Now I roll in a Olds, with windows that don’t roll
Down the roads where cars get broken and stole
These are the stories told by Stony and Cottage Grove
The world is cold, the block is hot as a stove
On the corners

I wish I could give you this feeling
I wish I could give this feeling, uh-uh
Uh-uh-ugh, on the corners, niggas robbing, killing
Dying, just to make a living, huh?

We overstated, we underrated, we educated
The corner was our time when time stood still and
Gators and snakeskins in
Yellow and pink and collared blue
Profiles glorifying them

Street lights and deep nights, cats trying to eat right
Riding no-seat-bikes, with work to feed hypes
So they can keep sweet Nike's, they head and they feet right
Desires of street life, cars and weed types
It’s hard to breathe nights, days are thief-like
The beasts roam the streets, the police is Greek-like
Game at its peak, we speak and believe hype
Bang in the streets hats cocked left or deep right
It’s steep life, coming up where niggas is sheep-like
Rappers and hoopers, we strive to be like
G's with three stripes, seeds that need light
Cheese and recite, needs and BE strife
The corner, where struggle and greed fight
We write songs about wrong ‘cause it’s hard to see right
Look to the sky, hoping it will bleed light
Reality's a bitch, and I heard that she bites
The corner

I wish I could give you this feeling
I wish I could give this feeling, uh-uh
Uh-uh-ugh, on the corners, niggas robbing, killing
Dying, just to make a living, huh?

The corner was our magic, our music, our politics
Fires raised as tribal dances and war cries
Broke out on different corners
Power to the people
Black power
Black is beautiful

Black church services, murderers, Arabs serving burgers
As cats with gold permanents, move they bags as herbalists
The dirt isn’t just fertile, it’s people working and earning this
The curb getters go where the cash flow and the current is
It’s so hot that niggas burn to live
The furnace is, where the money moving, the determined live
We talk shit, play lotto, and buy German beers
It’s so black packed with action that's affirmative
The corners

I wish I could give you this feeling
I wish I could give this feeling, uh-uh
Uh-uh-ugh, on the corners, niggas robbing, killing
Dying, just to make a living, huh?

The corner was our Rock of Gibraltar, our Stonehenge
Our Taj Mahal, our monument
Our testimonial to freedom, to peace, and to love
Down on the corner",https://genius.com/Common-the-corner-lyrics

My name is Common, No I.D

Ferrari Testas, Armani dressers
Exquisite thick bitches that body bless us
Rest assured, we getting festive in Miami now
Told my nigga Ye, I'm about to win the Grammys now
Getting Johnny Cash old white folks know me now
Standing close to the mic like I'm Kobe now
We celebrate with shots of the hate because we got love
It's the pop life, a lot of faces pop up
Known to tear the club and the block up
Going through the airport with more lye than an opera
Knew crooks who move books like Harry Potter
Get cleaners to get it cleaner
A legend like John, Lennon, I'm a dreamer
Tried to fuck the world she only let me finger
Mind trips to Medina to visit the redeemer
A hero, I'll drop out like Hiroshima
Off sangria with two broads at La Esquina
Still opening roads for Omoye and Amina
I'm a dreamer

It's for the world, world, world, world, world
Dream on

We take, uh, we make, uh, paper
And build skyscrapers
Walking on water, building my faith up
Niggas with no heart, I'm the pacemaker
Get the beat from No I, feel the pulse of the Chi
Survival of the fit with hope in they eye
Taking notes from the sky to fly above understanding
They notes from the most high, so I gotta land them
Career ain't random, make anthems, streets chant them
Rock roles like a phantom
Mad hoes like they throwing tantrums
I tell them I need space like Richard Branson
Dancing, with wolves and stars getting full at bars
And then pass out like a pamphlet
Never taking Grants for granted
It's Common, I'm high above standard
Fly nigga, keep my feet planted
To rock the planet, I don't stop for panic
Maybe I'm a hopeless Hip-Hop romantic
I'm a dreamer

It's for the world, world, world, world, world
Dream on

He introduced me, I stepped to the podium
Said peace, gave thanks to the holy one
Put my water up, thought about my daughter for a second
The youth, the living resurrection
Reflections of the sun glaring through the window
Now the audience staring at my mental
Feeling like the world, the world is at my fingers
'Bout to speak to an auditorium full of dreamers
Kinda took me back to when I first had a dream
To be like the king that sang Billie Jean
Now it's gold records, and I'm on silver screens
At the mountaintop, you still gotta dream
To the dreamers

If I dream you're here
And you dream I'm there
We'll be nowhere near
You should just come here
If I wake you up
Only difference is
You can live the dream
Just believe in it

Once you find your shoulders dropping
And your speech gets slow and hazy
You better change your way of being
Before you found your brain got lazy
You can build a better future when you join the winning team
If you desire a bright tomorrow, you must build a brighter dream
Dare to let your dreams reach beyond you
Know that history holds more than it seems
We are here alive today because our ancestors dared to dream
From Africa they lay in the bilge of slave ships
And stood half naked on auction blocks
From eastern-Europe they crowded in vessels overloaded with immigrants
And were mis-named on Ellis island
From South America and Mexico, from Asia, they labored in sweat shops
From all over the world, they came to America
Many shivering in rags, and still they dared to dream
Let us dream for today and for tomorrow
Let us dare to dream",https://genius.com/Common-the-dreamer-lyrics

Ye' you know how we do, we do it for the people

And the struggles of the brothas
 
and the folks
With lovers under dope, experiment to discover hopes
Scuffle for notes, the rougher I wrote, times was  harder
Went from rocky starter to a voice of a martyr
Why white folks focus on dogs and yoga
While people on the low end trying to ball and get over
Lyrics are like liquor for the fallen soldiers
From the bounce to the ounce, it's all our culture
Everyday we hustlin', trying get them custom rims
Law we ain't trusting them, thick broads we lust in them
Sick and tired of punching it, I look on the bus at them
When I see them struggling, I think how I'm touching them

Got back stage, and 
I bumped into Stevie

Can't leave rap alone the streets need me
Hunger in they eyes, is what seems to feed me
Inside peace mixed with beast seem to breed me

A gift from the skies, to be recognized
I'm keeping my eyes on the people, that's the prize

It’s Your World (Part 1 & 2),Be,2005.0,"Night blows, stoves don't work, hoes at work
A warrior, so I wear 'em on my shirt
Wish I was free as Che was, I spend a day buzzed
Trippin' on heights, wishin' for Nikes in different flavors
The age of Kane and Big Daddy, short-body Caddies
Uncles named Larry, that never really grabbed me
My mother gave birth but she really never had me
Left to the hood to play daddy
Raised by niggas named Butch, Scoot or Bae-Bae
With weight so they weigh they status on the streets
License plates that say they, motto
This is Chicago in the heyday
Similar to Good Times, I guess that I was JJ
A skinny nigga, young girls with Penny figures
So many niggas, stacked upon each other
It's the black upon each other that we love so much
Wonder how many of us, these drugs gonna touch
Used to gangbang, ain't really thug that much
Rather have some thick broads and a dutch to clutch
Went to school in Baton Rouge for a couple of years
My college career got downed with a couple of beers
Came back home, now I gotta pay back loans
Same nigga, same block, same shit they on
Only thing different, quicker, they click that chrome
In my defense, yo, I had to hit that zone
Man to man, I'm good workin' with my hands
My generation never understood workin' for the man
And, of being broke I ain't a fan
Now I stand in the same spot as my old man
My life I planned not to be on this corner
I still wanna see California
But this is my world

It's your world

Life and death flow around us
Four pounds and pounds of bird from out of towners
It's hard to stay grounded
We stay high, that's why old folks down us
Lost, nobody found us, the force that surrounds us
Ain't with us, they get us on the ground and hit us
We paint pictures of the chains under their names and scriptures
Removed from Earth, only to return through birth
Knew this girl sellin' her body, wish she knew what it was worth
Between God and trash, lookin' in every car that pass
With a walk that suggests head, to milk niggas she was breastfed
She know dairy so she say cheese to get bread
In the area where it's more weaves and less dreads
Kinda scary, amongst thieves and base-heads
Said it was her toes, but I could tell her soul hurt
She was cold turk, growin' up she got to know hurt
Very well in a world where self hate is overt
Her stepfather thought he was Ike, so her mother he strike
She got to like like-minded niggas, who liked crimes and figures
Doin' white lines and liquor, see hard times had kicked her
In the ass, it used to be thicker
Life is fast, some choose to be quicker
I remember in high school she had a passion to sing
Now she see herself in a casket in dreams
These are the children of crack and rap, blacks that lack
Self-esteem, yo we forgot the dream
On our Jeffersons y'all but we forgot the theme
In the Chi, we even rootin' for a garbage team
This queen never seen herself on this Corner
She still wanna see California
But this is her world

It's your world

I wanna be a pediatrician
I wanna be a governor
I want to be a artist
I wanna be a veterinarian
I wanna be a model

I wanna be an actress
I wanna be a superstar

Be, be here, be there, be that, be this

Be little black Sambo with bad hair
Be aware of Willie Lynch-ism
Be, be boundless energy
Be a four star ghetto general, be no one except I
Be a strong academic student, be an A student in Sociology
Be food for thought to the growin mind, be the author of your own horoscope
Be invited, be long-living, be forgiving, be not forgetful
Be a proud run, only to return to fight another day
Be peaceful if possible, but justice at any rate
Be high when you low, be on time but know when to go
Be cautious of the road to college, taking a detour through Vietnam or the Middle East
Be absent of wars at any past or present fought amongst themselves
Be visual of foreclosure over your shoulder while beggin
A nation built on free labor for reparation, Be a cartographer
A map maker, be able to find Afro-American land
Search thoroughly, it may be close to black land
Be amended 5/5ths, be amended 5/5ths human
Be the owner of more land than is set aside for wild life
Be cupid, to world government
Be found among the truth, lost tribe
Be at full strength when walking through the valley
Be not foolish as temporary king of the mountain top
Be a brilliant soul, sparkling in the galaxy while walking on earth

It's unseen or heard, a king with words
Can't knock the hustle, but I've seen street dreams deferred
Dark spots in my mind where the scene occurred
Some say I'm too deep, I'm in too deep to sleep
Through me, Muhammad will forever speak
Greet brothers with handshakes on ghetto landscapes
Where a man is determined by how much a man make
Cop Cognacs and spit old raps with young cats
With cigarettes in their ear, niggerish they appear

Ran so far from the streets that you can't come back
You tripping with nowhere to unpack, forgot that

In front of two-inch glass and Arabs I order fries
Inspiration when I write, I see my daughter's eyes
I'm the truth, across the table from corporate lies
Immortalized by the realness I bring to it
If revolution had a movie I'd be theme music
My music, you either fight, fuck, or dream to it
My life is one big rhyme, I try to scheme through it
Through my shell, never knew what the divine would bring to it
I'd be lying if I said I didn't want millions
More than money saved, I wanna save children
Dealing with alcoholism and afrocentricity
A complex man drawn off of simplicity
Reality is frisking me
This industry will make you lose intensity
The Common Sense in me remembers the basement
I'm Morpheus in this hip-hop Matrix, exposing fake shit
[Chorus: Bilal & 
Prodigy
]
And you know, yes you know
""This is rap for real, something you feel""
And you know, yes you know
""This is rap for the black people""
Heeeeyyyy, heeeeeyyyy
""This is rap- This is rap for real""
And you know, yes you know
""This is rap for the black people""

Some days I take the L to gel with the real world
Got on at 87th, sat by this little girl
She recited raps, I forgot where they was from
In 'em, she was saying how she make brothers cum
I start thinking, how many souls hip-hop has affected
How many dead folks this art resurrected
How many nations this culture connected
Who am I to judge one's perspective?
Though some of that shit y'all bop to it, I ain't relating
If I don't like it, I don't like it, that don't mean that I'm hating
I just want to innovate and stimulate minds
Travel the world and penetrate the times
Escape through rhythms in search of peace and wisdom
Raps are smoke signals letting the streets know I'm with 'em
For now I appreciate this moment in time
Ball players and actors be knowing my rhymes, it's like
[Chorus & Outro: Bilal & 
Prodigy
]
And you know, yes you know
""Thi- This is rap for real, something you feel""
And you know, yes you know

Heeeeyyyy, heeeeeyyyy

Yeah, I appreciate that, I appreciate that, sister. You know, it's like I think we gotta portray women in a better light. You know how- you know most rappers is talking all this other stuff, making women look bad. You know, I was raised by my mother. You know, I got a daughter, so it's like-
Wait, 'scuse me- hold on- hold on- 'scuse me, one second, sister- 'scuse me, one second, sister

They don't know

They say a nigga lost his mind
But in the scheme of things I never lost a rhyme
The thin line between love and hatred
I'm the black pill in the Matrix, the saturated life
They say life is what you make it
So I wait quick on a spaceship so I can take it
As high as the stakes get when paper get low
I be tellin' Derick, ""Tell Cara get us a show""
Little Com, I make righteous bitches get low
The richest man ain't necessarily the nigga with dough
They say ""You ripped"" ""Wow..."" Yea, that's what they say
My niggas couldn't tell it was me, like Jamie in Ray
Paintin' a day, wit focused crime, broads, and good wine
They say ""Dope is sour so it's homework and hood crimes""
I stood mine, for forever and a day so goodbye

Groupie love now, gotta be them wheels!
Haters back down, gotta be that steel!
I know they can't wait till ya outta ya deal!
Look how they did D'Angelo ask him how do it feel!
My best friends worry bout me
'Cause they know when you famous
And you had made cash
The media aims at us
And you be up so high
If you ever fall off, it feel like a plane crash
But God don't ever give me nothin' I can't handle
So please don't ever give me records I can't sample
So I could vacate where it ain't no channels
But it's quite okay for a gangsta to wear sandals
They say because of the fame and stardom
I'm somewhere in between the church and insane asylum
I guess it's messin' with my health then
And this verse so crazy when I finish
I'm just gon' check myself in

Amongst the lifeless, in a world crazy as Mike is
On my paper, whether its weed or Isis

Writin for my life 'cause I'm scared of a day job
They say ""Sef kept the hood together""
I tell the young, ""We can't play the hood forever""
Play my cards right, they say I went too left
They showed me strange love, like I was Mr. F
Played chess in this game of, pawns and knights
Now I claim ""King"" like Don, or Frank White

Testify,Be,2005.0,"She walk into the court her knees buckle
Saying for a man to survive he needn't hustle
Seen and been through struggle her whole life
Made a transition from being his ho to his wife
Stifling, the night upend the ATF bust in
Her daddy was a hustla, so she love them
Looked at the jury how can they judge him, she screamed

Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away
Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away
Please let me testify

Fear in her chest her face in tears
Had her man's back he was facing years
In her name though the place was his
They tryna take everything except the kids
For years she been through stumbling fights
While he tryna hustle that white
Up all night wondering if he's alive
Seeing him tried she bubbled inside and screamed

Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away
Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away
Please let me testify

The judge yelled for order the court
Reporter making her words shorter
His lawyer sat next to him
She could see how the trial was affecting him
It hurt for her eyes to connect with him
Using her lies for protecting him
They arrested him for murder and gun possession
As they read back her confession, she screamed

Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away
Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away
Please let me testify

The court awaited as the foreman got the verdict from the bailiff
Emotional outbursts tears and smeared makeup
He stated, he was guilty on all charges
She's shaking looking like she took it the hardest
A spin artist, she brought her face up laughing
That's when the prosecutor realized what happened
All that speaking her mind, testifying and crying
When this bitch did the crime, the queenpin

I Want You,Finding Forever,2007.0,"Once the love was strong
Now it’s long, long gone
Cause the pain, came down like a storm
I remained, holding on
Cause I want you, cause I want you
I want you, I want you

I’ve been thinking bout, I’ve been thinking bout
I’ve been thinking bout you lately
Thoughts take me to when we were close
Addicted to your love, feel I need another dose
I know it’s a feeling that should be long gone
Things seem to come up when I hear our song
Golden brown girl, it seemed so long
Since I heard your voice, where did the king go wrong?
Emotions that, that they linger on
I guess cause I never knew a love so strong
So many hot girls, I need your warm
The taste of your mouth, girl, I need your warm
Good food and love I need your warm
This here was made before we were born
A dreamer so I’m a keep dreaming on
It’s kind of like ‘The Breakup’ with Jen and Vince Vaughn

Once the love was strong
Now it’s long, long gone
Cause the pain, came down like a storm
I remained, holding on
Cause I want you, cause I want you
I want you, I want you

They say you don’t know, know, know what you got
’Til what you got is gone
Yeah I like such and such, yo a lot but the feeling’s not as strong
We were like 2 birds that were able to fly
I try to pick the right words to say to the sky
Some days I would try but wasn’t able to cry
I never been good at saying goodbye
I take a deep breath when the times is hard
When I reminisce over you, my God
I spent many years trying to be the heartthrob
I guess it’s only right that I got my heart robbed
The scent of a room that reminds me of you
A hint of perfume it reminds me of you
Take a look at the moon it reminds me of you
Hope the stars and the gods align me and you

Once the love was strong
Now it’s long, long gone
Cause the pain, came down like a storm
I remained, holding on
Cause I want you, cause I want you
I want you, I want you

We do what we do and we do what we live
I love this way cause I got it as a kid
With so much to give from it, I never hid
The love that I wrote on the mirror it got smeared
My friends say it was a change for the better
But I say, girl you changed my forever
Relationships they can be as strange as the weather
Rain or sun we can sing this together

Cause I want you, cause I want you
I want you, I want you
Cause I want you, cause I want you
I want you, I want you

Letter to the Free,Black America Again,2016.0,"Southern leaves, southern trees we hung from
Barren souls, heroic songs unsung
Forgive them Father they know this knot is undone
Tied with the rope that my grandmother died
Pride of the pilgrims affect lives of millions
Since slave days separating, fathers from children
Institution ain't just a building
But a method, of having black and brown bodies fill them
We ain't seen as human beings with feelings
Will the U.S. ever be us? Lord willing!
For now we know, the new Jim Crow
They stop, search and arrest our souls
Police and policies patrol philosophies of control
A cruel hand taking hold
We let go to free them so we can free us
America's moment to come to Jesus

Freedom (Freedom)
Freedom come (Freedom come)
Hold on (Hold on)
Won't be long (Won't be long)
Freedom (Freedom)
Freedom come (Freedom come)
Hold on (Hold on)
Won't be long (Won't be long)

The caged birds sings for freedom to ring
Black bodies being lost in the American dream
Blood of black being, a pastoral scene
Slavery's still alive, check Amendment 13
Now whips and chains are subliminal
Instead of 'nigga' they use the word 'criminal'
Sweet land of liberty, incarcerated country
Shot me with your ray-gun
And now you want to trump me
Prison is a business, America's the company
Investing in injustice, fear and long suffering
We staring in the face of hate again
The same hate they say will make America great again
No consolation prize for the dehumanized
For America to rise it's a matter of Black Lives
And we gonna free them, so we can free us
America's moment to come to Jesus

Freedom (Freedom)
Freedom come (Freedom come)
Hold on (Hold on)
Won't be long (Won't be long)

Resurrection,Resurrection,1994.0,"""Resurrection""

Yeah I'ma get this one off for 87th Street
South Side of Chicago, Chicago everywhere, check it
It's like come on, y'all, get live, get down
Common Sense is in your town
I said come on, y'all, get live, get down
Common Sense is in your town

I stagger in the gatherin' possessed by a patter-in
That be scatterin'
Over the global, my vocals be travelin', unravelin' my abdomen
It's slime that's babblin' grammatics that are masculine
I grab the men, verbally badgering broads
I wish that Madelyne was back on Video LP
I went against all odds and got a even steven
Proceed to read and not believin' everything I'm readin'
But my brain was bleedin', needin' feedin', and exercise
I didn't seek the best of buys, it's a lie to textualize
I analyze where I rest my eyes
And chastise the best of guys with punchlines
I'm Nestle when it's crunch-time
For your mind like one time
If poetry was pussy I'd be sunshine
'Cause I deliver like the Sun-Times
Confined in once-mines on dumb rhymes I combine
I'm hype like I'm unsigned, my diet I un-swine
Eating beef sometimes -- I try to cut back on that shit
This rap shit is truly outta control
My style is too developed to be arrested
It's the freestyle, so now it's out on parole
They tried to hold my soul in a holding cell so I would sell
I bonded with a break and had enough to make bail
A Mr. Meaner fell on his knee for the jury
I asked No for his ID and the judge thought there was two of me
Motion for a recess to retest my fingerprints
They relinquished Sense, 'cause I was guilty in a sense

""Resurrection""

I ride the rhythm like a Schwinn bike when in dim light
I use insight to enlight devices hit the skin tight
Words of wisdom wail from my windpipe, imagination's in flight
I send light, like Ben's kite, I've been bright
Get open like on gym nights and in fights I send rights
Don't hook with skins my friends like, I spend nights up in dykes
In spite, I've been indicted as a freak of all trades
(Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo) I got it made
I bathe in bass lines, rinse in riffs, dry in drums
Come from a tribe of bums hooked on Negro and mums
Had to halt with the, malt liquor
'Cause off the malt liquor, I fought niggas
Now my speech and thoughts quicker
Cruise the Southside streets with no heat and no sticker
UAC got my back and we don't get no thicker
UAC got my back and we don't get no thicker
UAC got my back and we don't, now check it
I'm a ho but not a ho nigga, ain't scared of no nigga
When it's my turn to go, I gotta go
And I'm gone with the storm

Kingdom,Nobody’s Smiling,2014.0,"I do dirt, in search of a clear mind
Money talk, somebody's gonna hear mine
Grind early before 9:30
Got the nine and the thirty
Kiss of death, you heard me?
My world ain't worldly, any time could be my time
I get high, but still ain't seen Chicago skyline
In my prime, stakes is high cause it's beef
Out here in these streets
Everybody tryna eat off the same plate
Dead presidents, we want the same face
And to think, me and the president, we from the same place
Four-hundred and twenty-one murders, ain't tryna be of the same fate
If I die and go to heaven, will I make it through the main gate?

Help me get, get the keys to the kingdom
Ooh
Help me get, get the keys to the kingdom

Ah yes, my Lord, Ah, Oh
Ah yes, my Lord, Ah, Oh

Second row of the church with my hood on
My homie used to rap, he was about to get put on
At his funeral, listening to this church song
His family yelling and screaming, I hurt for ‘em
A cold world that’s why we pack heaters
Listening to this preacher as he tryna reach us
I’mma need to go back, I gots to get 'em
Back and forth in these streets, that’s the rhythm
Revenge is supposed to be the Lord's but I use my own accord
When I seen him on the porch, cost my man his life, I can’t afford not to hit him
Shots ripping through his True Religion denim
These streets was my religion
I stood over him, his life is over then
Now these keys got me locked up with older men
Thought these was the keys for me to roll a Benz
They ended up being the keys for my life to end

Now I'm in a hearse, what's this cash really worth?
My whole life I had to worry about eatin’
I ain’t have time to think about what I believe in
When the days of the kingdom for Chicago gon' come?
I’m coming back like the Prodigal Son, and I got a son
And I don’t want my ways following him, the streets swallowing him
And I don’t want no hollows in him, his momma said she see his father in him
Hope it’s the good things, ‘til life was over is when I understood things
Standing at the gates ‘cause I know you’ve forgiven what I’ve done
I’m your son, do I have the keys to get in?

My sinning father see, got a shipment by the seas
See my niggas tryna eat, eat whatever’s on your plate
Save some for me, the worst things in life come sitting six feet
Tryna hop the gate to heaven ‘cause I couldn’t get a key
But these niggas play for keeps and I gotta hold my own
Tryna watch my back ‘cause these stripes ain’t free
We still wading in the water, cocaine, blunts, marinating in the water
Leina took a puff and then she gave it to my father
Used to take the bullets out so I could play with the revolver
Satan serenading ever since I was a toddler
Tell ‘em talk is cheap, niggas living for the dollar
So in God we trust, leave the praying to my momma though
Another motherfucker out of control
Just walking my soles low
, lit up with the abuse
They wasn’t for show, I promise every pistol was used
See I was waking up afraid to see my name on the news
Broad day, bare faced, giving niggas the blues
Nigga who you? They know me on the streets where I grew

Cloth,The Dreamer/The Believer,2011.0,"We were from different cities on the same block
Grew up in different circles in the same spot
Like raindrops we fall in love giving our all
Showing her ring off like a player at the ball
I recall the walls that I had up
Attracted to women for things that didn't matter
Ka-clow boom pop! Sound of my heart when it drop
The night that I met her, it might be forever
I hear people saying that they like us together
I ain't afraid to gamble when life is getting better
With you, I admit I had issues
Like ebony, your essence,
 
your pedigree, your presence
It's more than clothes can say for you
When I shop I gotta spend more than a day for you
I pray for you and us, that we imbue through lust
And accrue the trust, let's shake off the dust
From the cloth

Oh you're worried about when people stop and stare
That's just a tear on those beautiful clothes you wear
Cut from the same, cloth you just want to wear
But that's just a tear because girl I can get you fresh
La la la la, la la la la

This is tailor-made love, fit like a snug
Anything we can bear so let's have some cubs
You were there when my cuz passed away
Not only does love, but life hatches day
I appreciate the hugs and the days I breed with you
Strong seeds I can see with you
, the good word I read with you
Looking at things that we've been through
Things that seem simple
I know when to go hard and when to be gentle
Sentimental laughs and expressions
Let's stay in the present, no time for second guessing
You said it's this cloth that makes you feel naked
The truth we address it, that's so unexpected
Yeah that's the thread that helps us move ahead
Your hunger for affection will always be fed
Thank God we never sped and let love take its course
Cause what's inside of us, no need to outsource
The cloth


Hey lover we can cover each other
Through the coldest nights, tight never smother
It's two things that seems to hold us together
God is our tailor and forever
It's two things that seems to hold us together
God is our tailor and forever
It's two things that seems to hold us together

Real Nigga Quotes,One Day It’ll All Make Sense,1997.0,"Real nigga quotes I tote
Got some shit on the free but this is shit that I wrote
Legendary like The Goat, who got game?
Give it a quarter rest while I make these quarter notes
My album, niggas was expecting, now my water broke
Before it, I was sort of broke
Get the paper for the funnies, sports and the horoscope
Order curry goat like Fluke Stokes order coke
You sharp with your rings and chain but you short of rope
At the end of the road trip still, I'mma hold shit down like syndrome
Rappers are like Fox Brown trying to get home
Barely get your touchdown, I'm in the end zone
You can't honor what I'm on, then bitch nigga get gone
Fuck the wind storm, my pen told the street folklore
Body language spoke raw
Don't talk to broads that are spoke for, that provoke war
Stand out like cold sores, claim you hard but you ho-core
George Bush and CIA you moving O's for
I write like Richard for publishing while you sold yours

Com got rhymes, Dug make beats
Sound complete, plus unique, the shit be sweet
You know the shit be real

Chicka-chicka-M chicka-C chicka-M am I
People call me Com and collective with perspective
I draw crowds, go off like car alarm sounds
Bomb like 'Nam sound, tell your bitch to calm down
Must want to give me skull asking me to take my hat off
I'm ill, raps I spit as if I had a bad cough
This crank nigga stole a style and ain't take the tag off
Playing yourself, you can't come with it, so you jack off
More heart than an artery, jones in my bones
To see thugs in harmony, it's gonna be some drama
If you try to sit Com down, this ain't comedy
Shit is real like a station property, crew is forming colonies
Commonly, I hear these rats thinking they mahogany
On every rap hook, sounding like a dog to me
In a reservoir, I flow and go
On and on, like Erykah or etcetera
Designated not to make hits but hit home
Out of proportion, hit makers get blown

Com got rhymes, Dug make beats
Sound complete, plus unique, the shit be sweet
You know the shit be real

R&B studs kill me with they hardcore ballads
Love songs is violent, them niggas whole style is silent
I hate to staple the singers together
But in my head it's been ringing forever
And a day if you grew up on Marvin Gaye
While all you singers booty this and freak me baby, it gets me
Emcees be insecure, like them little ho niggas immature wearing bobs
If I got a show in your town, I'm there with mob
Bukeing niggas and pulling broads is they apparent job

A Dream,Once Upon a Time in 2006,UnKnown," (Sample from Martin Luther King's 
""I Have A Dream"" speech
)
(I have a dream) I got a dream
(That one day) We gonna work it out
(That one day) We gonna work it out
(That one day) We gonna work it out
(I have a dream) I got a dream
(That one day) That one day
(That one day) I'm a look deep within myself, I gotta find a way
(I have a dream)

My dream is to be free
My dream is to be...
My dream is to be...
My dream is to be free

In search of brighter days, I ride through the maze of the madness
Struggle is my address, where pain and crack lives
Gunshots coming from sounds of blackness
Given this game with no time to practice
Born on the black list, told I'm below average
A life with no cabbage
That's no money if you from where I'm from
Funny, 
I just want some of your sun
Dark clouds seem to follow me
Alcohol that my pops swallowed bottled me, no apology
I walk with a boulder on my shoulder
It's a cold war, I'm a colder soldier
Hold the same fight that made Martin Luther the King
I ain't using it for the right thing
In between lean and the fiends, hustle and the schemes
I put together pieces of a dream, I still have one



The world see me lookin' in the mirror
Images of me, gettin' much clearer
Dear self, I wrote a letter just to better my soul
If I don't express it, then forever I hold
Inside, I'm from the side where we out of control
Rap music in the hood play the fatherly role
My story like yours, yo it gotta be told
Tryna make it from a gangsta to a godlier role
Where it scrolls and stow slaves, 
and Jewish people in cold cage
Hate has no color or age
Flip the page, now my race became freedom
Write dreams in the dark, they far but I can see 'em
I believe in heaven more than hell, lessons more than jail
In the ghetto, let love prevail
 with a story to tell
My eyes see the glory, and well
The world waiting for me to yell ""I Have a Dream""",https://genius.com/Common-a-dream-lyrics
Black America Again,Black America Again,2016.0,"Here we go, here, here we go again
Trayvon'll never get to be an older man
Black children, they childhood stole from them
Robbed of our names and our language, stole again
Who stole the soul from black folk?
Same man that stole the land from Chief Black Smoke
And made the whip crackle on our back slow
And made us go through the back door
And raffle black bodies on the slave blocks
Now we slave to the blocks, on 'em we spray shots
Leaving our own to lay in a box
Black mothers' stomachs stay in a knot
We kill each other, it's part of the plot
I wish the hating will stop (war!) and the battle with us
I know that Black Lives Matter, and they matter to us
These are the things we gotta discuss
The new plantation, mass incarceration
Instead of educate, they'd rather convict the kids
As dirty as the water in Flint, the system is
Is it a felony or a misdemeanor?
Maria Sharapova making more than Serena
It took Viola Davis to say this
The roles of the help and the gangstas is really all they gave us
We need Avas, Ta-Nehisis, and Cory Bookers
The salt of the Earth to get us off of sugar
And greasy foods; 
I don't believe the news
Or radio, stereotypes we refuse
Brainwashed in the cycle to spin
We write our own story, black America again

You know, one way of solving a lot of problems that we've got is lettin' a person feel that they're important. And a man can't get himself together until he knows who he is, and be proud of what and who he is and where he come from, and where he come from…

Hot damn, black America again
Think of Sandra Bland as I'm staring in the wind
The color of my skin, they comparing it to sin
The darker it gets, the less fairer it has been
The hate the hate made, I inherited from them
But I ain't gon' point the finger
We got anointed singers, like Nina, Marvin, Billie, Stevie
Need to hear them songs sometimes to believe me
Who freed me: Lincoln or Cadillac?
Drinkin' or battle raps? Or is it Godspeed that we travel at?
Endangered in our own habitat
The guns and dope, man, y'all can have it back
As a matter of fact, we them lab rats
You build the projects for, now you want your hood back
I guess if you could rap, you would express it too
That PTSD, we need professionals
You know what pressure do, it make the pipes bust
From schools to prison, y'all, they tryna pipe us
Tell your political parties invite us
Instead of making voting laws to spite us
You know, you know we from a family of fighters
Fought in your wars and our wars
You put a nigga in 
Star Wars
, maybe you need two
And then, maybe then we'll believe you
See black people in the future
We wasn't shipped here to rob and shoot ya
We hold these truths to be self-evident
All men and women are created equal
Including black Americans

You know, you know, you know, one way of solving a lot of problems that we've got is to let a person feel like somebody. And a man can't get himself together until he knows who he is, and be proud of what and who he is and where he come from, and where he come from…

Retrospect for Life,One Day It’ll All Make Sense,1997.0,"Yo, we gotta start respectin' life more y'all
You look at your brother man you gotta see yourself
Gotta see the God within him
We brothers gettin' changed real quick over nothin'
We losin' too many of ours
Gotta recreate y'all
Yo, check it

Knowin' you the best part of life, do I have the right to take yours?
Cause I created you, irresponsibly
Subconciously knowin' the act I was a part of
The start of somethin', I'm not ready to bring into the world
Had myself believin' I was sterile
I look into mother's stomach, wonder if you are a boy or a girl
Turnin' this woman's womb into a tomb
But she and I agree, a seed we don't need
You would've been much more than a mouth to feed
But someone, I would've fed this information I read
To someone, my life for you I woulda had to leave
Instead I lead you to death
I'm sorry for takin' your first breath, first step, and first cry
But I wasn't prepared mentally nor financially
Havin' a child shouldn't have to bring out the man in me
Plus I wanted you to be raised within a family
I don't wanna, go through the drama of havin a baby's momma
Weekend visits and buyin' J's ain't gon' make me a father
For a while bearing a child is somethin' I never wanted to do
For me to live forever I can only do that through you
Nerve I got to talk about them niggas with a gun
Must have really thought I was God to take the life of my son
I could have sacrificed goin' out
To think my homies who did it I used to joke about From now on I'ma use self control instead of birth control
Cause 315 dollars ain't worth your soul
315 dollars ain't worth your soul
315 dollars ain't worth it

I never dreamed you'd leave in summer
You said you would be here when it rained
Why didn't you stay

Seeing you as a present and a gift in itself
You had our child in you, I probably never feel what you felt
But you dealt with it like the strong black woman you are
Through our trials and tribulations, child's elimination
An integration of thoughts I feel about the situation
Back and forth my feelings was pacin'
Happy deep down but not joyed enough to have it
But even that's a lie in less than two weeks, we was back at it
Is this unprotected love or safe to say it's lust
Bustin', more than the sweat in somebody you trust
Or is it that we don't trust each other enough
And believe, havin' this child'll make us have to stay together
Girl I want you in my life cause you have made it better
Thinkin' we all in love cause we can spend a day together
We talkin' spendin' the rest of our lives
It's too many black women that can say they mothers, but can't say that they wives
I wouldn't chose any other to mother my understanding
But I want our parenthood to come from planning
It's so much in my life that's undone
We gotta see eye to eye, about family, before we can become one
If you had decided to have it the situation I wouldn't run from
But I'm walkin', findin' myself in my God
So I can, discipline my son with my rod
Not have a judge tellin' me how and when to raise my seed
Though his death was at our greed, with no one else to blame
I had a book of African names, case our minds changed
You say your period hasn't came, and lately I've been sleepy
So quit smokin' the weed and the 
beadies
 and let's have this boy

I never dreamed you'd leave in summer
You said you would be here when it rained
Why didn't you stay
I never dreamed you'd leave in summer
Now the situations made things change
Why didn't you stay",https://genius.com/Common-retrospect-for-life-lyrics
The Believer,The Dreamer/The Believer,2011.0,"I believe in the light that shines and will never die
Oh I believe the fire burns, we stay alive
They will talk about us
Like they talked about the kings before us
They will talk about us

These are the words of a believer
Achiever, leader of the globe
Feeding souls of those in need
I bleed the blood of the struggle
Walking over troubled puddles
Hustles in my chest, no hustle no progress
Extremities of life and it's process
Birth of a son, death of another
With love I caress both mothers
And told 'em, who’s in control is the one that's above us
I walk where money talks and love stutters
Body language of a nation going through changes
The young become dangerous, pain gets spent into anger
Anger gets sent through the chamber
It’s tough when your own look like strangers
We are the sons of gangsters and stone rangers
If he could how would Ernie Barnes paint us?
Look at the picture, hard not to blame us
But time forgives in the Chi where the young die often
Do they end up in a coffin because we haven’t taught them?
Is it what we talking, we really ain't walking?
Dues hustlers pay, how much did it cost 'em?
Find myself on the same corner that we lost ‘em
Real talking, in they ear like a walkman
Thoughts spin around the corner to the world
When I see them, I see my baby girl
Believe!


The lord lives among us, 
the younguns hunger
Become a means to get it by any ways nece-
-ssary,
 under pressure, children feeling lesser
With the steel up on the dresser 
killin' will aggressors
Destiny’s children survivors, soldiers
In front of buildings they eyes look older
Hard to see blessings in the violent culture
Face against weapons, sirens, holsters
That ain't the way that Langston Hughes wrote us
Soul controllers on the shoulders of Moses and Noah
We go from being Precious to Oprah
Cultivated to overcome ever since we came overseas
Today and the way that you can see we determined
Solar keeps burning,
 shawty’s know to keep learning
Lesson’s in our life are like stripes that we earning
Took gramps' advice that Christ is returning
Like a thief in the night,
 I write the beacons of light
For those of us in dark alleys and parched valleys
Street hits spark rallies of the conscience conquerors of a contest
That seems beyond us,
 
even through the unseen
I know that God watches
From one King's dream, he was able to Barack us
The prophets, nothing can stop us

Diamonds,Nobody’s Smiling,2014.0,"Ohh
Walk up in the thing, got my campaign poppin’
Champagne poppin’, bad thang poppin’
Headed to the door, and ain’t a damn thing knockin’
Nooo
Walk up in the thing and everybody with me mobbin’
Campaign poppin’, champagne poppin’

I wrote this on my born day, it was a warm day
Niggas gotta eat, we gon’ do it gourmet
I’m hearing fuckin’ voices, like when porn play
Stay, stay on your grind like foreplay
What more can I say? Diamonds are for the day
That means to shine, you find a way
Stayed on porches, backyards, and gangways
Learned strange ways between Cole and Langley
Champagne ambitions
I pour it out for my man who made  his transition
Wars about paper, pussy, pride and ego
Born to fly, call me the bald eagle
Open shows at the Regal for Daddy Kane and Eazy-E though
Boys in the hood is hard like kilos of heroin
The hero that came from zero
My bars and my PR like Puerto Rico
This bra from the DR said I was frío
That’s Ice Cold like Dre, triple three yo
Pinot noir style, better with time
I’m gambling with watches getting better with time
So I’mma ride this out for long as God allow me
They say “time is money”, forever is my salary
I shine tomorrow with what I do today
Yo, get this money, put the diamonds on display

Ohh
Walk up in the thing and got my campaign poppin’
Champagne poppin’, bad thang poppin’
Headed to the door, and ain’t a damn thing knockin’
Nooo
Walk up in the thing and everybody with me mobbin’
Campaign poppin’, champagne poppin’
Hit you with the street sweeper now you gotta get to moppin'
Nooo

Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Tryna get it every way, every day, day, day
Tryna get it every way, every day, ay, ay
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Tryna get it every way, every day, day, day
Tryna get it every way, every day, ay ay
Tryna get it every way, every day, day, day

Bars in alignment, stars in alignment
Raw off consignment, God’s in the diamonds
Evolve from the science, power and refinement
Read between the lines, hard to define us
Niggas that’s behind us, throwing up signs to signify us
In the Benz leaning like we biased
I’ve seen Len Bias, that shit scared me
You can go pro and blow everything you have in a flash
The moment is to live it like your last
Moments that we have never living in the last
My time, man, precious like diamonds
Look through the glass, see what I magnify man
I'mma be shining 'til I die man
I’m a rare diamond that’s hard to find man
Climbing to the mountain top, MLK day
To the streets I speak my piece like an A.K
47 to 87 to the hundreds
Jewels I could run it for the hunted and the blunted
Dreams reflect clarity, ain’t no disparity
Between peace and prosperity, so marry me
Diamonds

Reminiscing when I had everything on layaway
I’m rolling with me and my partner like it was Training Day
Way before the ballin’ that was back off in the training days
I used to hit the barber chair and say “I need that fadeaway”
Had a crush on what’s her name, the feelings never fade away
Older brother gang bang, banging like an 808
Said you can’t take his chain away
Real player you can’t take this game away
Slang away, walk up in this thing like a real Rockefeller
But you can’t take my dame away
Devil in a red dress, but she got that angel face
I could teach her how to get it day-to-day-to-day-to-day
The G code is my combination
Catch me off in the bank thumbing through all kinds of faces
Catch me off in court, beating all kinds of cases
Weed, money, pussy, liquor, that’s my favorite compilation

I tell 'em ""fuck 'em"" like I do to police
The beast is runnin' rampant
I'm in between sheets tryin' to have sex that's tantric
For the ghetto, tryin' to make a get-up stand-up anthem
You spit hot garbage son of Sanford
What you rappin' for to get fame or get rich?
I slap a nigga like you, and tell him ""Rick James bitch!""
With your Hollywood stories, on porches
We polly hood stories about who became rich
And whatever light they hit, we wanna hit the same switch
You didn't know where to aim it, you still remain bitch
I'm forever puttin' words together
Some'll sever mothers from daughters and fathers from sons
The name Com', has never been involved wit' run
Unless it's DMC, or runnin' these broads to bein' free
I'm harder than the times, you hardly scary
Holdin' gats inside, you cats is Halle Berry

Tell the law my Uzi weighs a ton

On the streets they try to beat us like a drum
In Cincinnati, another brother hung
Again he won't see the sun, with his family stung
They want us to hold justice, but you handin' me none
The same they did Kobe and Michael Jackson
Make them the main attraction
Turn around and attack them
Black gem in the rough, you rugged enough
Use your mind and non power, get the government touch
Them boy chat chat on how him pop gun
I got the black strap to make the cops run
They watching me, I'm watching them
Them dick boys got a lotta cock in them
My people on the block got a lotta Pac in them
And when we roll together, we be rocking them
To sleep
No time for that, cause there's things to be done
Stay true to what I do so the youth dream come
From project building, seen a fiend being hung
With that happening, why they messing with Saddam?
Burn a bush,
 
cause for peace he no push no button
Killing over oil and grease, no weapons of destruction

You know this, rap shit we 'bout to own it dun, for real

Ay, it's like a ritual
You been invited let the mortal body stimulate the place
With the grace, nevertheless, I stress
Let the music put a smile on your face
As for the ritual, when it comes to spiritual excellence
You know I always leave you with the taste
I know you like it hard to the core
That's what you ask for, you aching for the best
Hurtin like a sore in that ass, like a ritual
Conversation with the most high makes me wanna cry
I wonder why, you wanna get to paradise
But that itty bitty part of you don't wanna die
So pay attention to my word, cause it's the truth
Meditation ease the mind, and brings the youth
It's like a verse you could never read out of a book
Dropping the line in your mind like a fish hook
Word is birth, yo I do it till the break of day
Pay attention to your art, never go astray
Word is bond

Yo we do it and we don't quit
Sucka nigga you don't want it, it's Thelonious
Owning this rap shit, super microphonist and we known to spit
I spit fire like Esther on Sanford and Son did
I'm raw duke, more juice than Sunkist
You want this, see when J get to saying the rhyme flawless
Shit fly like MJ in his prime, Off The Wall with mines
I'm grabbing my balls when I rhyme, nine-nines busting plus
Ball all the time, now stay on your mind like great sex
You ain't on my mind I'm thinking bout paychecks
Niggas large like an 8X Avirex jacket
Connant Gardens
 they bust like latex sex packets
Emcees they don't rhyme and ball, they lyin' to y'all
They dyin' to ball, the rhyme we do all the time
We do all the fine bitches they fall in lines
Me and my mans is something like the Source Sports
We gettin money a long time and y'all short
My niggas bounce and full rise and y'alls fall
You funny duke, cause really you think you can do me
When you roll a 500 that's really a 320
Should of let somebody else hook it
Numbers look crooked like King Kong shook it
I'm from where niggas bang gats when they celebrate
That's how they play, don't let it be a holiday
Thelonious niggas, if you testin us we get you laid back
Show you the definition of a payback",https://genius.com/Common-thelonius-lyrics

Yeah, Dilla

Two DJs, one microphone
We freestyle, we write at home
It don't, it don't, uh-uh, we go on
You the one I can't leave alone
You grown? I know you groan
When I'm in you, I feel home
We in the house of love, no lie
Appreciate you more as time goes by
When it's truly true, it don't die
I see you in L.A., I see you in N.Y
I see you in the A, I see you in the Chi
I hear you when JAY still make the song cry
Truthfully, I wanna rhyme like common sense
You the one that gave me that confidence
You the one that told me 'bout consciousness
And said see beyond my metropolis
You put the booga-booga loop, pop lockin' this
We too far, ain't no stoppin' this (We're too far, now)

Who knew? Who knew that we would take it this far?
I, I love you, so just be who you are
Who knew? Who knew that we would take it this far?
I, I love you, so just be who you are

Here, here, here, here, here, here we go
They say that, that love makes you grow
You've been sen-sen-sensational
Instrume-e-intational
In my life, you've been vocal
But at times, I felt like I didn't know you
Now I know you had to grow too
And experience life so you can know you
We all change, for what it's worth
You an angel and still down to earth
In many ways you like my religion
When no one else did, to me you listen
Gangstas, gods, you hugged and kiss 'em
No matter, you stayed in my system
Your eyes glisten, you talk vision of partyin'
And gettin' people out of prison
Through the struggle you taught us to Nipsey Hussle
That's why we all love you

Who knew? Who knew that we would take it this far?
I, I love you, so just be who you are
Who knew? Who knew that we would take it this far?
I, I love you, so just be who you are

You gave me a voice in the world
It's been hard to choose another girl
They trip when you mumble, they trip when you sing
But you gave us a chance to dream
In young thugs, you see a future
You recognize little uzi ain't here to shoot ya
At 21, you knew I was savage
But you said, ""Common, you will never be average""
It's a cold world, we need JAY
If you could dot com, you could dot K
You rock two chains, keep your mind free
You see a Malcolm X in a YG
You told me I'm the mane like Gucci
With a chance to rap and make movies
You gave mills to the meek, to inherit the Earth
Before me too, you said, ""Ladies first""
Things get rocky, you there ASAP
Rocky or Ferg, you there to swerve
I want you to get the love you deserve
My will made it on a mic' with words
With no name, I was a hard MC
Love and hip-hop, on some Cardi B
Now you a part of me, creatin' Tyler style
A future ain't odd to see
Free spirit, with young will like Jaden
When I see you, you never agin'
Made in America, for the world to see
You everybody's but you my girl to me
I'm forever yours, to the tic-toc
I'm still talking 'bout you, hip-hop

G.O.D. (Gaining One’s Definition),One Day It’ll All Make Sense,1997.0,"After bein' 25 you know just trying to survive in the world
About to have a little boy or baby girl. Who knows?
Anyway just when you start gettin' that little age and experience to you start thinking about stuff, trying to make the right moves
So bust it out this is what I was thinkin' check it

Yo the education of the Lon chicka Lonnie Lynn
Began, began with time
Being my bloodline is one with the divine
In time brother, you will discover the light
Some say that God is Black and the devil's White
Well, the devil is wrong and God is what's right
I fight, with myself in the ring of doubt and fear
The rain ain't gone, but I can still see clear
As a child, given religion with no answer to why
Just told believe in Jesus cause for me he did die
Curiosity killed the catechism
Understanding and wisdom became the rhythm that I played to
And became a slave to master self
A rich man is one with knowledge, happiness and his health
My mind had dealt with the books of Zen, Tao the lessons
Qur'an and the Bible, to me they all vital
And got truth within 'em, gotta read them boys
You just can't skim 'em, different branches of belief
But one root that stem 'em, but people of the venom try to trim 'em
And use religion as an emblem
When it should be a natural way of life
Who am I or they to say to whom you pray ain't right
That's who got you doing right and got you this far
Whether you say ""in Jesus name"" or ""Hum do Allah""
Long as you know it's a bein' that's supreme to you
You let that show towards others in the things you do
'Cause when the trumpets blowin', 24 elders surround the throne
Only 144,000 gon' get home
Only 144,000 gon' get home
Only 144,000 gon' get it, baby

I've lived and I've learned
I have taken and I've earned
I have laughed, I've cried
I have failed and I have tried
Sunshine, pouring rain
Found joy through all my pain
I just wanna be happy with being me

Let me voice my concern
So many of my fellow brothers have given themselves a title that their actions didn't earn
Our ignorance is in the same breath as our innocence
Subconciously, seeking to find an impressionable mind to convince
I've finally come to the realization why Black people in the worse place
'Cause it's hard to correct yourself when you don't know who you are in the first place
So I try to find the clue in you
But evidently, White folks know more Black history than we do
Why're we being lied to? I ain't know our history was purposely hidden
Damn, something in me wanna know who I am
So I began my search, my journey started in church
It gave my heartache relief when I started to understand belief
Hustlin' was like a gift spent my share of time in the streets
Taught me survival from this evil I'm just gonna have to deal with
And I felt like a fool when I tried to learn it in school
It almost seemed like a rehearsal when the only science and math are universal
Takin' elder advice, read the Bible, the Koran
Searched scrolls from the Hebrew Israelites
Hold on, this ain't right, Jesus wasn't White
Some leads were granted with insight
And it's all in the plan, but it took me some time to overstand
He still created with the imperfection of man
So, with following I disagree
By no means have I forgotten or forgiven what's been done to me but
I do know the Devil ain't no White man, the Devil's a spiritual mind
That's color blind, there's evil White folk and evil niggas
You gon surely find there's no positivity without negativity
But one side you gonna have to choose
Any chance to speak I refuse to misuse
So how can you call yourself God when you let a worldly possession
Become an obsession and 
the way you write your rhymes and can't follow your lesson
If a seed's sown, you make sure it's known, you make sure it's grown
If you God, then save your own, don't mentally enslave your own
If you God, then save your own, don't mentally enslave your own
If you God, then save your own, don't mentally enslave your own

I've lived and I've learned
I have taken and I've earned
I have laughed, I've cried
I have failed and I have tried

I just wanna be happy with being me",https://genius.com/Common-god-gaining-ones-definition-lyrics
Real People,Be,2005.0,"Yeah, yeah, you know how me and 'Ye do

Real People walk in the streets, 
the streets is talkin'
Often it's beef this city never does
People walk and talk in they sleep
Cold sweats and wet dreams
On how to get green our faith is all in a jeep
Black souls raw and they deep
Hypes tryna talk with no teeth
Shorties sayin' ball or retreat
A lesson we all speak at one point or another
What you expect from one who smoke a joint with his mother
Anointed hustlers in a fatherless region
Through the pain wish they know that God was just teachin
'
We want decent homes
So dreams we say out loud like speakerphones just to keep em on
It's like a colored song that keep keepin' on
I guess knowin' I'm weak is when I'm really bein' strong
Somehow through the dust I could see the dawn
Like the Bishop Magic Juan, that's why I write freedom songs
For the real people

I wonder if the spirits of Bob Marley and Haile Selassie
Watch me as the cops be tryna and pop and lock me
They cocky, plus they mentality is Nazi
The way they treat blacks I wanna snap like paparazzi
We're the children of a better God searchin' for better jobs
We could cop ghetto cars tryin' not to catch a charge
They say the dope game is sour
Now they doin' homework that's when they follow you for hours
Come to your crib and devour all that you work for
Must be more than paper these niggas hurt for
Through the purple haze I circle days I rhyme that work for pays
Tryna reverse the slave's mind and insert the brave mentality
Heard that it's drama at home
Can a dude break free and still get honored at home
I was told by a chief it's the games nature
When you're glowin' some will love and some will hate ya
It's real people

Black men walking wit white girls on they arms
I be mad at 'em as if I know they moms
Told to go beyond the surface, a person's a person
When we lessen our women our condition seems to worsen
The weary cursin' the sky, talkin' to themselves
Givin' the version of why help and hurt in they eye
I live across from it, some of it I do be in
I be showin' niggas lives like

Relationships with men have been so damagin

Dreams of doing scenes with Terrence Howard and
Broadway plays and dancin with Alv and them
The ones that make it always ain't the talented
Some dreams get lost never to be found again
At first strippin seemed so empowerin
Most every girl wanna do it now and then
But bein meat every day is devourin
Cats puttin paper where she put powder and
Life would break her, now she powderin
She was high when she fell down and then
Crowd surrounding and, heart was poundin and
She fell into a deep sleep the siren sounded and
Seen bright lights in the midst of clouds and then
Talked to God, feeling like his child again
Said Lord let me live so I can make you proud again


The life we lead, will always lead us
And we pray that he, will never leave us
It's the price we pay, I guess that's the reason

A Song for Assata,Like Water for Chocolate,2000.0,"In the Spirit of God
In the Spirit of the Ancestors
In the Spirit of the Black Panthers
In the Spirit of Assata Shakur
We make this movement towards freedom
For all those who have been oppressed, and all those in the struggle
Yeah. yo, check it-

There were lights and sirens, gunshots firing
Cover your eyes as I describe a scene so violent
Seemed like a bad dream, she laid in a blood puddle
Blood bubbled in her chest, cold air brushed against open flesh
No room to rest, pain consumed each breath
Shot twice with her hands up
Police questioned but shot before she answered
One Panther lost his life, the other ran for his
Scandalous the police were as they kicked and beat her
Comprehension she was beyond, trying to hold on
To life; she thought she'd live with no arm
That's what it felt like, got to the hospital, eyes held tight
They moved her room to room; she could tell by the light
Handcuffed tight to the bed, through her skin, it bit
Put guns to her head, every word she got hit
""Who shot the trooper?"" they asked her
Put mace in her eyes, threatened to blast her
Her mind raced till things got still
Opened her eyes, realized she's next to her best friend who got killed
She got chills, they told her: that's where she would be next
Hurt mixed wit anger, survival was a reflex
They lied and denied visits from her lawyer
But she was building as they tried to destroy her
If it wasn't for this German nurse they would've served her worse
I read this sister's story, knew that it deserved a verse
I wonder what would happen if that would've been me?
All of this just so we could be free
So dig it, y'all

I'm thinking of Assata, yes
Listen to my love, Assata, yes
Your power and pride is beautiful
May God bless your soul

It seemed like the middle of the night when the law awakened her
Walkie-talkies crackling, I see them when they're taking her
Though she kind of knew
What made the ride peaceful was the trees and the sky was blue
Arrived to Middlesex Prison about 6 in the morning
Uneasy as they pushed her to the second floor in
A cell, one cot, no window, facing hell
Put in the basement of a prison with all males
And the smell of misery, seatless toilets and centipedes
She'd exercise, paint, and begin to read
Two years in a hole, her soul grew weak
Away from people so long she forgot how to speak
She discovered freedom is a unspoken sound
And a wall is a wall and can be broken down
Found peace in the Panthers she went on trial with
One of the brothers she had a child with
The foulness they would feed her, hoping she's lose her seed
Held tight, knowing the fight would live through this seed
In need of a doctor, from her stomach she'd bleed
Out of this situation a girl was conceived
Separated from her, left to mother the Revolution
And lactated to attack hate
'Cause federal and state was built for a Black fate
Her emptiness was filled with beatings and court dates
They fabricated cases, hoping one would stick
And said she robbed places that didn't exist
In the midst of threats on her life and being caged with Aryan whites
Through dark halls of hate she carried the light
I wonder what would happen if that would've been me
All of this just so we could be free
Yeah, I often wonder what would happen if that would've been me
All of this just so we could be free
So dig it, people

I'm thinking of Assata, yes
Listen to my love, Assata, yes
Your power and pride is beautiful
May God bless your soul

Yo, from North Carolina her grandmother would bring
News that she had had a dream
Her dreams always meant what they needed them to mean
What made them real was the action in between
She dreamt that Assata was free in their old house in Queens
The fact that they always came true was the thing
Assata had been convicted of a murder she couldn't've done
Medical evidence shown she couldn't have shot the gun
It's time for her to see the sun from the other side
Time for her daughter to be by her mother's side
Time for this beautiful woman to become soft again
Time for her to breathe, and not be told how or when
She untangled the chains and escaped the pain
How she broke out of prison I could never explain
And even to this day they try to get to her
But she's free with political asylum in Cuba

I’m thinking of Assata, yeah
Listen to my love, Assata, yeah
We’re molded from the same mud, Assata
We share the same blood, Assata, yeah
Your power and pride, so beautiful
May God bless your soul
Your power and pride, so beautiful
May God bless your soul

Freedom? You're asking me about freedom? You're asking me about freedom? I'll be honest with you. I know a whole more about what freedom isn't than about what it is, because I've never been free. I can only share my vision with you of the future, about what freedom is
The way I see it, freedom is-- is the right to grow, is the right to
Blossom. Freedom is-- is the right to be yourself, to be who you are, to be who you wanna be, to do what you wanna do--",https://genius.com/Common-a-song-for-assata-lyrics

Here's a little story that must be told (*beat scratches*)
From beginning to end}

I got so much trouble on my mind
So I take time out my day
To pray and I say, now lay me down to sleep
Hopin' that I keep my soul
Peep, I'm gettin' old and this a cold, cold world
And I ain't even got a bomber
Livin' with my momma, it's the same routine
Keep my room clean, I'm lookin' to do some new things
But ain't shit to do
I'm twenty-two, catch
In the prime of my life, I have no time for a wife
I funnel through the tunnel, disgruntled
Tryin' to find me some light
In the rim of darkness, I too sing
I may not be the darkest, brother
But I was always told to act my age, not my color
Not knowin' that my color, was out of the original
So now I sing the new negro spiritual
It goes, 'get up, stand up
Stand up for your rights
Get up, stand up
Don't give up the fight
It's like, how can you understand the pain
When you never had to stand under the rain?
When it rains, it pours
And it's about to come down hard, thank God
I found you

As I walk down the road of existence
I get resistance from all angles
I tangle for cash
Hopin' it'll last 'til the end of the week
But all I eat is fast food
And you know how junk food goes right through ya
So I return *to* the a-rab, then on the way back
I stop- at the liquor store, grab me a six pack
Knowin' that once I'm done with that I'll be back
To get some more
Once I get started I don't wanna stop (ahh...)
And I can't turn around, brew- I can't turn it down
Ironically I turn it up, my liver I burn it up
It's my life I live it up, the cup I gotta give it up
One day
I'm cruisin' down a one-way street
And I done passed *fun* day- three blocks ago
It itself, life is an obstacle
As I maneuver through the manure I try to be responsible
I want a job but I ain't lookin' (how come?)
I ain't tryin' to degrade myself, bein' nobody's Calvin I'm a couch bum
What makes it bad, I had incentive
But that disintegrated to a state that stagnated
I procrastinated
I can't recall a day without bein' intoxicated, or blowed
I'm dealin' with a full deck, at any day I can fold
What makes it bad, I wasn't dealt that bad a hand
And I had a plan
But things didn't go through
The way they were supposed to
Thank God I found you

It's like a jungle, sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under, I ponder
And try to keep my
Concentration In this idiotic nation
They say become a doctor, but I don't have the patience
Adjacent to that situation
I want an occupation that I'm into
Cause yet have I begin to
Live to my potential, I went to
School for fourteen years and my best teacher was experience, I reminisce
And wish, I could go back in time to eighty-nine
When there was just' 'sunshine'
But now it's like, I'm gettin' older there's so much strain and stress

Made in Black America,UnKnown,2014.0,"Uh, yeah
Made in Black America, metaphor for a predator
Been to the Mediterranean, on my papers like a editor
I flow like a reservoir, dog
Rap Tarantino, off the chain like Django
Still let the chain glow, where they bang though
And niggas get shot like camera angles
In rap videos put up on Vimeo
I'm where the buck 50 bicentennial perennial all-star
Fruit that don't fall far from Islam
When rap is dead, I had the fluid, that embalm
I speak, you know I'm in the building like an intercom
Enter Com, the world's most
Intricate, integrated with imminent
Domain, I'm feeling myself like a sentimen-
-Tal letter written to myself
Aspirin' for greatness, wellness and wealth, I'm cold, I'm hard to melt

Uhh, I'm more than a hot song, or a hot album
Ask my ex, I still live on like Malcolm
My spirit and style done a transformation
Make room, nigga I don't need reservations
You sweet as a hotel, I stay presidential
Strange to be sinful and know that Heaven sent you
To rearrange the mental, I've seen things we've been through
It's hard for a man to claim gentile, let me change the tempo
I be with broads that got they shit together
Even if it ain't meant forever, still smoke the spliff together
The essence of the herbs, the presence of the words
Yeah you got a chest but I'm treasurin' your curves
You walk past, I'ma look behind you
Look you up and down to find you
Can see I was designed to, give you power and refine you
You fucking with me we can grind to
Gather the better Black America

Yeah, made in Black America, takin' threats from a terrorist
We will never meet but the media feed hysteria
And I be inferior, if I be in fear of ya
More godly than gluttonous but my supper's superior
You know the difference 'tween the kids with the lunch tickets
And the ones with the money, in the cafeteria
I break bread with with my brethren like a pizzeria
Spinnin' dough, you'll find red dots over cheese, be a-
-Ware of your whereabouts, don't be feeble
I'm pissed off, tinkle is the onomatopoeia
You's just a little star (twinkle) sure ain't me
Been a superstar since ma made me
My president is black (uhh)
I wonder if Pac thought we was ready for that or did we move too fast?
I don't give a fuck, shit, my grandpa glad
They pass that gun law or not, niggas still gon' pop up dead

Yeah, I'm the Morpheus in this hip-hop matrix, exposin' fake shit
Used to borrow dollars, now my sense ain't so common
Went across the whole nation screamin' Hiiipower (HiiiPower)
Never been a racist, but I love horsepower
I'm hot, that's why I got the fans in the stands
Em fans googlin', enemies shakin' hands
Restorin' the balance, detourin' the malice
We kill you motherfuckin' mice with a mallet (uhh)
This is Huey P Newton with a QP
Bobby with a Seale, Fred Hampton on pills
In the Hamptons, now that's ill, what's happenin'?
I'm just trying to teach my homies 'bout the Emerald tablets
Stop the war in Syria over a bowl of cereal
Kill a instrumental then book a flight on Expedia

Gold,The Dreamer/The Believer,2011.0,"So we made it to this same end of the road
And we picked up lots of chicks and pots of gold
How I made it out with my soul

Ashtrays and cigarretes, last days, indigenous people
These are adventures of young black millionaires
I am the voice of the meek and underprivileged
The smell of success, I want y'all to get a whiff of this
On the move like black slaves through the wilderness
I write it, and still get invited to white Christmases
When I was born, three wise men came to visit us
One a hustler, one a king, one a prisoner
They cracked the bottle then started giving gifts
You from Chicago, we want you to deliver this
Show the walking dead who the true and living is
Separate the fake from who the real reals is
Hot tub time machine, back to the Sybaris
Hats from liquor stores to avoid syphilis
Frivolous spending, drunk nights with storybook endings
I guess it's my addiction to women
I was in France, in to see Hennessy blending
Writing my own scripts like I'm Tennessee Williams
Now it's new beginnings like a born again Christian
On the mic, victorious, story is redemption

I'm sitting at the top, I'm not alone
I'm standing here with my soul

Feed our souls with two fish and five loaves
Teach a man to cook it for survival
My dad said it rained on my arrival
Now a storm of the brain make these guys drive slow
Like I was 5-0,
 
but my creed's Apollo
On the rock and roll with the coldest live show
For those before I came, I made the song cry for 'em
Lyrical gymnast, you set the bar low
This is the Kilimanjaro
, 
like Twitter you can follow
It may be hard to read like hieroglyphics
Written on the walls of Cairo
, check my youth revival
Truth inside flow, I stand like Em did with Dido
Crash parties, any live yo
Is libel to get banged like things that rival tribal slang
From the pride we'll reign, kill the game and watch it die slow

Love is not a mystery, it's everything

She was the type to watch Oprah and the Today Show
Be on the treadmill, uh, like OK Go
Had a body, A body that you can't pay fo'
That mean she had some Ds on her but they wasn't fake though
Had a drive for a drive for Rodeo
She spent pesos on those labels
Spin class at the gym, strip tease on a pole
She was so obsessed with her body and clothes
To every party she goes, tryin hard to be chose
They say it's hard for a pimp but extra hard for these (hoes)
Readin Us and People mag, tryna get the scoop
Chasin a actor for a Bentley Coupe
She been through the ball player from the Clippers, then came the pumps off
All thinkin she number one where she was just a jumpoff
Doin all she can for a man and a baby
Drivin herself crazy like the astronaut lady


He had paper since we was in we was in high school
Pop was a doc, mom taught at my school
Lock with the rocks, in his ears he kept jewels
One of the Diddy types, da D-D-Dame Dash dudes
Pushed a Maserati sport, reading the Robb Report
Wanted to be Mike but he was never live at sports
Since golf is in he was on the drivin course
To live the rap life is what he was strivin for
Spendin cash at the bar to get credit
Drinkin Chaundon just because Big said it
They say Ye is but dude was big headed
Rocked the fur in the summer so somebody'd pet it
He had a fetish for shoes that's athletic
Pathetic on his MySpace page half nekkid
It's a shame what they do for fame and to be respected
Joe, you coulda got it if you never woulda stressed it


They was one of them couples, people said they were the it
Unbreakable, like Bobby and Whit
Or Ryan and Reese, or Kimora and Russ
Relationships can be dead but look live to us
I guess we all been through it where we try too much
Losin yourself and you're lyin and stuff
Wishin for the diamond cuffs, in search of a ring
Where love is not a mystery it's everything


Gets me down
Gets me down
Gets me down
Gets me down
Gets me down
Gets me

Raw (How You Like It),The Dreamer/The Believer,2011.0,"Bow! Bow! 
I came through the door
With the raw Martin Margiela
Superstar status, everything stellar
With some bad bitches and some ex-drugs sellers
Niggas already jealous
We in this joint like Bob Marley and The Wailers
She already wanna pick, bitch don't be so over zealous
Go to the bar to get around like a propeller
The barmaid's name is Stella
I'm so appalled like McCartney that you would card me
Am I really mad? Hardly, I'm here to party
Wanting y'all to give me body like Lati-fah
Niggas in the corner smoking that ree-fah
Seen a girl she had bottom like a spea-kah
Wanna put some hands on her like a prea-cha
Hmmmm!
 Well let me take my time
She ordered Bacardi, getting twisted in the limelight
Seen that ass cause I got hindsight
She was lit shining bright in a fit that was tight
'Bout to get that invite to a night over Egypt
She said ""You rap?"" Yea mummy
I'm Tutankhamun kicking and spending this rap money

Feels so good
I wanna touch somebody
So let's go, go
Wanna feel you close, keep touching
Feels so good
I wanna touch somebody

She was all couture, in a Tom Ford
Security guard let me in 
cause I'm lord
Of finesse, the under,
 
the rings,
 the dress
Code is to always stay fresh
Aware of a chest cause I stay abreast
She was extra cold, I'm here to de-congest
This nigga next to us was slopped and made a mess
Knocking over bar stools, I hoped that he carpooled
I'm locked into my mood, 
long as dude don't disturb my groove
I won't have to take it back to high school
Rewind! 
No need to take me back in time
Keep my mind on the grind and the great feline
Cause what's in front of me is this behind
Up north, she's thick; down south she's fine
Tuned in to what I'm doing
I'm so unassuming when I'm pursuing
The ladies, the ladies, 
a soldier of love like Sade
Showing love to this lady when this nigga tried to play me
Saw me talking to slim and started acting shady
Dude got foul like crack in the 80s
Uh, uh, uh, uh! You don't wanna test this yo
You never know who got a Tec up in the disco
""You Hollywood."" Nah nigga, I'm Chicago
So I cracked his head with a motherfucking bottle

Feels so good
I wanna touch somebody
So let's go, go
Wanna feel you close, keep touching
Feels so good

I'm writing shit that I feel
Raps are black steel in the hour of commotion
The motion of Com is like that of a ocean
Devotion 'cause I'm the Earth, Wind, and Fire of hip-hop
By Rakim and Short, I've been inspired
My shit knocks environ...ments of cats with seventeen's
Tint, time is money, the mind is funny, how it's spent on getting it
I'm sitting with descendants of Abraham
Who say the jam is ""money, cash, hoes""
I went from bashful to asshole to international,
 lover of self
Word to the mother on my last record cover, it's felt
Now deal with it

I wanna get into it
Let’s do this
I wanna see you move it
So move it
So let’s just get into it
Let’s do this
Can you feel the music?
The music oh ah, can you feel the music, the music

In this never-ending battle to please
Niggas, magazine writers, emcees
Who request hot shit, I freeze
And tell them where I was rose, we always said cold
Hold your horses and your carriages
This never-went-gold nigga rocks shows carat-less
You not gon' respect self, at least respect the heritage
Affecting lives is where the wealth and the merit is
I realize what I portray day to day, I gotta carry this
And beats, rhymes and life is where the marriage is
Had dreams of fucking R&B broads, it came true
Journalist I wreck, shared the same view
Picked up a fallen angel on the path that I emcee
Familiar voice, come to find out the angel was me
Some say ""You changing, Rashid""
Times are, we still close
I rhyme far, away away away
From what you accustomed to hearing everyday, uh-ah
You know the dope-choppin, gun-poppin, homies dying
I'm amongst it, save the war stories for Private Ryan, INI

I wanna see you move it
So move it
So let’s just get into it
Let’s do this

The music oh ah, can you feel the music, the music

Women cry, children laugh, men dance
I refuse to lose self and try to win fans
Over
, weight on my shoulder fluctuates like Oprah's
My refrigerator poetry's magnetic like ultra
You couldn't hang if you was a poster
Posing like a bitch for exposure
It's rumors of gay emcees, just don't come around me with it
You still rockin hickies, don't let me find out he did it
Got my eyes on the tiger, eyes on the prize
Eyes on the thighs, of Mary J. Blige
Imagining how good the cat must be
Stop eatin meat, lost weight, but I still rap husky
My verse depth, is that of a baby's first step
Or the old lady who died and the nurse wept
I flow like cursive writing
, inviting you and yours to my openess
Shows allow me to cop range like a vocalist
But man does not live on bread alone
What good is a range when it's time to head home?

The Neighborhood,Nobody’s Smiling,2014.0,"Thousand lives ago, we were young and we didn't know
We were trading our crowns for our souls
Made the sacrifice, headed back to the light
But be careful don't drown in the gold
I know it glows but it's cold

I'm from the other side of town, out of bounds
To anybody who don't live around
I never learned to share or how to care
I never had no teachings about being fair

Have you ever heard of Black Stone around Black Stones?
And Four CHs, Vice Lords, Stony Island on Aces
The concrete matrix, street organizations
They gave violations, hood public relations
It was the basics to get big faces
Stay away from cases, bad broads, good graces
The hustlers was the taste makers and trend setters
They the ones that fed us hopin' that the feds don't get us
The era of Reagan,
 
the terror of Bush
Crack babies, momma's a push, we were the products of Bush
I'm wishin' for a Samurai Suzuki and a little Gucci
A bad ho to bee-bee-bee do me, you heard of Flukey
Stokes, it was folks and coke and dope
Fiends choked off of smoke, herringbones and rope
Rare jewels of a generation
Diamonds, blinding us of real shit we facin'
Forties wasted on 'ceased
, 
Dion makin' the beats
When they air it out on at the parties we escapin' the heat
I could break it down like whatever you need
He squinted his face and rolled the weed

You know they don't see sometimes that in the neighborhood, it's the exact same thing. It's the same thing over and over again. Feel me?

Have you ever heard of no limit, three hundred, six hundred?
Folly boy, O block, eastside
Where it ain't no conversation they just let them heats ride
Can't nobody stop the violence, why my city keep lyin'?
Niggas throw up peace signs but everybody keep dying
Used to post up on that strip, I look like a street sign
I've been out there three days and I got shot at three times
Felt like every bullet hit me when they flew out each nine
I be happy when I wake up and I have a free mind
I know haters wanna clap me up, watch the morgue grab me up
But they can catch me later, I been cool, chasin' paper
Where I come from ain't no hope if you was claimin' that was major
Small crib, big fam, mom was workin', granny raised us
No food in the refrigerator, I was bangin', pullin' capers, that's real shit
Same niggas from day one boy, yeah I'm still with
Better watch out for that jump shot cause they will hit
Homie take your shorty lunchbox, and won't feel shit
I came from a place where it's basic but you won't make it
Feds buildin' cases, judges who racist and full of hatred I mean
You ain't never seen the shit that I seen

Yo, just relax, take it easy, slow down
I had this—I had this friend of mine
Who, just, you know, he was moving too fast, you know what I'm sayin'?
I told him to slow down, he said the sun don't chill
I said, I said still, I said still, you gotta
Just appreciate life, sit back, don't let it fly right past you
No matter what go on I'm still gettin' mine
No matter the year, no matter the place, no matter the time

Check it
It's like I'm fighting for freedom, writing for freedom
These record company niggas I don't like when I see 'em
My ancestors, when I'm writing I see 'em and talk with 'em
Hoping in the promise land I can walk with 'em
Shitted on so many rappers it's like I'm in the stall with 'em
Molest concepts
, 
stalk rhythms
, 
paid dues, bought wisdom
As legends fall my godmother answer heaven's call
Preachers' daughters get fucked in the reverand's hall
MCs reckless eyeball, why y'all wanna go and do that?
Must've thought I was solo, the name just ain't the 
U-Ac
No mo', still together
Like in the ghetto 
photo with one nigga in the chair
Holding liquor in despair, gang signs in the air
I shine in spaces where time is just a glare
Hold the mic like a memory
Niggas say I'm nice with metaphors but these are similes
Street ministry
, 
my poetry's a penitentiary, track is visitation
Sentences is life,
 
I'm like chief up in this demonstration
Still...


You squirm with discomfort, wiggle and cough
Six days of madness and you might throw me off
On this great ball of stress that they call the earth
I'mma show y'all in rhyme just how much shit I been through
And all the places I went to, always played the low
It's like a competition, this mission here I'm telling you
Slip up and rhyme-ass niggas here is felling you
Crash courses, slow down you can't learn that quick
Cause I'm the dead eye, 
with the red eye
, from Chi to L-I
I thought y'all knew, every year I grew, I'm still growing
And in a year or two I hope my girl'll be showing
A male seed,
 
praise God I name him Moses
I lead people I want him to, that's why I chose this
Now is the glass half-full or half-empty
Common, why they tempt me
The 
king of the simply, bore in mic
I always stay on top cause I give niggas what they like
I know y'all hate that why I feel I owe y'all everyday
If y'all hear it a thousand times, it's gon' be the same way
The 'Dat-Father, go farther, why bother
Now I'm a peaceful man, I don't want no stress
You know I'm still...


Yo yo, some get Range Rovers, some religion change-over
Angel on my main shoulder telling me remain sober
Token nigga, game's over ain't no payola in freestyle
In battles, I'm warring like a G-Child
Searching for the child in me, this style in me
This release is like the piece that's now in me
They tried to 'sassinate me god, like Martin on the balcony
Lyrically I put a hit on 'em, cause I'm the style ""Nitti""
Catch a flick at the Liquid Kitty
Trying to get a chick to kick it with me 
till the tilt
Told her my chamber's like Wilt
Built with her for a sec, let her know I had respect
Less than a hour she was giving me neck

You think different and understand how I float
Got cribs on both Coasts
But, I'm a Chicago-getter
You get down, but you ain't a golddigger
You got the soul with the figure to match

Creative with the gifts, plus he hit it from the back! (Ugh!)

Turn over in the morning, make it warmer and better

Making a Name for Ourselves,One Day It’ll All Make Sense,1997,"Yeah, yeah, me and my man Common Sense
Rallying troops like Joseph Stalin
Where you at, yo?

I'm about to make the name Common Sense a name you fear
Y'all niggas is scared, I'm your worst nightmare squared
And I'm a make the name Canibus a name you fear
Y'all niggas is scared, I'm your worst nightmare squared
That's double for niggas who ain't mathematically aware
""Catch another sucker duck MC out there""

I can tell by how you write, you the type to run in a fight
I hold mics while you hold spite
Like a broken-hearted bitch, don't give no fuck who your team or who you started with
Cameoed or charted with, I house niggas like apartments with
Mic mechanisms, I dissect a rhythm
Move crowds with kinetic wisdom
It's like a Malcolm X-orcism, fuck the rhythm, I hit him
I want him got and I get him, auction his wack ass off, then bid him

I'm creating the ultimate verses with perfect lines
Putting together the web of my rhyme one thread at a time
So you niggas need to stop testing me
Because you know you can't ""F"" with me, stepping to me with insuperior weaponry
Exposing yourself to the verbal radiations
Saying you can defeat me is nothing but speculation
Lyrics unravel, faster than bullets travel through barrels
Niggas be digging my styles like fossils of pterodactyls
Who wanna battle? I'm bad to the bone marrow
The Earth got one sun, but I walk with three shadows
With Allah, my supernatural bodyguard
Niggas couldn't touch me if they gave me a massage
MC's will compete with lyrics and beats get crushed
I'll hit you in your chest so hard, your shoulders will touch
What?

""Stepping to me is like going to the county being a neutron""
""I ain't scared of no nigga""

I pursue sound fairs, relaxed like Dru Down's hair
Other nigga's rhymes are like gang signs, I throw down theirs
On knots, I landed, players get played like Hamlet
Supposedly nice, taken for granted like life
I write twice and drop singles in record pools
Niggas I'm dunking like when cops mingle
Fuck hip-hop jingles, rhyming big words and not saying shit
The clique that you came in with accent your flavor with
Like moose, I go to the caves and get niggas off all fours
I'm the shit that's uncalled for, the shit that you fall for
Far more advanced than a rapper whose career
You could only take a glance
Couldn't make the transition from B-boy to C-note stance
I stand in a circumference of humbleness
But in the Chi rumble it's
Mistaken as a weakness, when poetry's in motion
Like a picture, I'm the main feature
Amongst hard working teachers and corrupt preachers
I make my living off of singles like Latifah
In between sheets like reefer with blunted senses
You couldn't make a statement if you was from a sentence
I'm cold with numb intentions

""Fucking with Canibus""
""Fucking with Canibus""
""Fucking with Canibus""
""Fucking with Canibus""
""Yo, sick with it""

Yo, the Canibus is a animal with a mechanical mandible
Coming to damage you, spitting understandable slang at you
I be the all seeing lyrical, hammerhead shark peripheral
With three-hundred sixty degree visual
When the signal was given, MC's get bitten
With venom from a poisonous algorithm liable to kill 'em
My style will get in 'em, way up in 'em
My face don't belong in The Source, it belongs on the Shroud of Turin for certain
I grab mics and murder shit
It's wickeder than Satan worshipers going to Catholic church services
You heard of this, the lyrical verbalist slash herbalist
The wrath of my cold-blooded verses is merciless
Rap snap, get your ass cracked like bear traps
Contaminate your air sacs like tear gas
And I swear black, try to battle me, you won't last
I'll turn your ass into ""The Artist Formerly Known As""
You gay-ass fag, I'll blow you to ashes with tactics
Strip you naked, then make you hug a cactus, you bastard
So fat to be a rap star, taking pictures at music seminars
People know who you are
Now I got mad shorties that wanna call me because they saw me
Up in The Source chilling on page forty
Put this in your CD-ROM
WWW-dot-Canibus-dot-com
You can find me on the internet talking to chicks
That was sweating me off the ""Music Makes Me High"" remix
I be talking mad trash, trying to get 'em to laugh
See, if I click and drag long enough, I'll get the ass
Bring it back to the lab on Mount Prospect Ave
Let your chicken suck me off and send her home in a cab
You know how we do, liquid aluminum like the T2
Beasts from the East part two, coming to see you

It's time I made the name Common Sense a name y'all fear
Y'all niggas is scared, I'm your worst nightmare squared
Now that I made the name Canibus a name you fear
You still scared, I'm your worst nightmare squared
That's double for niggas who ain't mathematically aware
""Catch another sucker duck MC out there""
Since I made the name Common Sense a name y'all fear
Y'all niggas is scared, I'm your worst nightmare squared
And since I made the name Canibus a name you fear
Stay scared, I'm still your worst nightmare squared
That's double for niggas who ain't mathematically aware

Ooh that boy he radical
Talk that money talk emphatical
Who in the game had the baddest hoes
Niggas seen Badu's ass and said ""I seen what you was on""
Home grown with no home phone
From the city of wind nigga, win or go home
It's the Chi bullshit I'm on
Make a dome from a brick and a pocket full of stones
Hit them cones, clips and crones
I don't play away games, I got hitters at home
I'm a dime like six in the morn'
Me and Muhammad speak in similar tones
Go hard like pyramid stones
Stand the test of time cross the burning sands
With aggressive rhymes, I'm blessed to rhyme
I invest in time
Like Superman, stick out my chest and shine, I'm

Yeah yeah, I'm black, I'm magical
I ride fun facts that's actual
Keep it one hunnid that's natural
To get them new blue hunnid niggas strapped with flow
Shout out to black and DC make it capital
I done made enough. I don't have to rap no more
Tell the truth, that ain't what I'm rapping fo'
Got a whole lot so we can have some mo'
So rosey go to red diamond make 'em clap some more
Clap clap, 
home of the original gang bangers,
 gun clappers, no lackers, rack stackers

Let It Lie,Smallfoot (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) [Deluxe Edition],UnKnown,"Um, where are you takin' me?

Aha, so many questions. I think it's about time I give you some answers

Wow. What is this?

You see, Migo
There was a time when Yetis lived beneath the clouds
We were alive and we were thriving till we came across a crowd
Of 
Smallfoot
, 
that's right, we used to live down there
But there were actions we could not forgive down there
And though they used a different nomenclature
Man, or human, they showed us human nature
A dangerous species that we approached with wonder
They attacked with their spears and their 
smokin' sticks of thunder
They called us Sasquatch, they called us abominable
They chased 
us
, pursued us, their persistence indomitable
We had no choice but to run and hide
Otherwise, we surmised we were facin' genocide
So we climbed this mountain just to stay alive
You see, we knew that up here, Smallfoot cannot survive
So it was here the first law was written in stone
It was named and proclaimed as a truth to be known
Our world is an island, it floats on a sea of endless clouds
That's how it would be
And then we wrote more laws, more rules to obey
For the sake of us all, it was the only way
To protect us from all of the human ravages
Heaped upon us by those human savages
(Now you know, now you know, now you know)
(Now you know, now you know) And new rules apply
(Now you know, now you know, now you know)
So it's best just to 
let it lie
 (Let it lie)
(Now you know, now you know, now you know)
(Now you know, now you know) And you can't deny
(Now you know, now you know, now you know)
That it's best just to let it lie (Let it lie)

But my Smallfoot, he's not like that

They're all like that. Tell me, when you found him. Did he greet you with open arms?
They don't care about us. They don't care about anything but themselves. Which is why we must do the same if we care about our future

Wait, we're below the clouds

Or so it would seem, but look closer

Those aren't clouds, it's steam

The stones are working

The stones?

Every job and every task is pointless as it seems
All of it ensures that this important machine
Keeps turning and turning and spinnin' around
So those below don't look up and those above don't look down
And they'll look 'cause even if they hear of these atrocities
The only thing stronger than fear is curiosity
(Now you know, now you know, now you know)

Wait
 so, so none of those stones are true, they're all lies?
(Now you know, now you know, let it lie)

Good lies to protect our world
(Now you know, now you know, now you know)

But they need to know the 
truth

Oh, do they?
You feel emboldened by your noble quest to find the truth
I chalk it up to the naive innocence of youth
So let me share a secret that you'll learn as you grow older
What's true or not true is in the eye of the beholder
So do you wanna prevent our own annihilation? (Yes!)
Then our only goal should be to control the flow of information
Unless you wanna see the Smallfoot conquer and pillage (No!)
Then protect the lie and you protect the village
Lives are at stake, Migo. Your friends, your father, Meechee
She's curious and you know what they say: curiosity killed the yak

So what do you want me to do?

Tell everyone you were lying about the Smallfoot

But they've already seen it, they--they're not gonna believe me

You'll be surprised at what they'll believe
You think knowledge is power, Migo?
(Now you know, now you know, now you know)
(Now you know, now you know)
Question is
(Now you know, now you know, now you know)
What are you gonna do with that power?
(Hmm)",https://genius.com/Common-let-it-lie-lyrics
Lovin’ I Lost,The Dreamer/The Believer,2011.0,"I remember (REPEATS)

I remember she sit there with her thickness
Never played a game but I heard about them sisters
A wise mister said love is ""gonna get'cha""
But that ain't what I read in the scriptures, God be with us
It was hard for me to take down the pictures
I was tripping, I even called her sister
I could be someone you could talk to, each and every day
But you were 'bout to marry, be on your merry way
I'm singing through the pain like I was Mary J
Cause we break up to make up like Mary Kay
Rumors leaving tumors on my heart now
We fell in love huh just to fall apart now
I get your calls and I try to disregard now
What was easy for us now is hard now
Huh? Who do it better, we used to move together
Now we not together, is this our new forever?


Hell nah, I'm waiting on your call
Told you be I'll be back, had to break down some walls
Issues that I had
Some say it comes from not seeing my dad
Keep moving on
Hard for me to stay away and stay in touch
Girl, my heart is broke and I need a crutch
Thought I was okay but nights that I stayed up
Ass got me layed up, girl I never gave up
On you and us, I tried to take it day by day, and whew its tough
I know your young and you gotta live your life ma
I thought it was the right time for me to wife ya
I must confess, I miss the days of you laying on my chest
So confusing losing love, I'm saying god bless
Who do it better, we used to move together
Now we not together, is this our new forever?",https://genius.com/Common-lovin-i-lost-lyrics
Windows,The Dreamer/The Believer,2011.0,"If your eyes are the window to your soul
Open eyes bring the cold
If your dreams keep you warm in night
Baby just keep 'em closed
If your eyes are the window
I can sneak in at night
In your eyes I can see your soul
Staring back into mine

She was a beautiful rose
From the concrete and heat she grows
In the dark room her life was exposed
Her picture of men, we walk on all fours
Heart opened and heart closed
Every now and then she sparkles
You can tell she was hurt by the words that she chose
I'm thinking like Lauryn, a rose is still a rose
Even when the door close, there grows a new one
I told her it's some good men, she asked me if I knew one
Her daddy left a hole because she never really knew him
Ok, sometimes from commitment, we do run
Rocking Lou Vuitton, said she focused on the Christian
I'm speaking to her trying to enhance her vision
But not to be married with kids she was wishing
Shhh, 'til your soul just listen

If your eyes are the window to your soul
Open eyes bring the cold
If your dreams keep you warm in night
Baby just keep 'em closed
If your eyes are the window
I can sneak in at night
In your eyes I can see your soul
Staring back into mine

She said daddy take me ice-skating
Looking at the rear-view, life's waiting for her
Gotta be there to support her
Can't really wait for a court order
She got the type of aura that's fun and vibrant
A lot of love inside, got to help guide it
Daddy will protect it, God will provide it
We all will be there so your soul ain't divided
Man, how quick she grows
Looking like her momma but she got my toes
I suppose it's the age that she really really need me
A lot of girls without, they become needy
""Come on, Dad, I'm too old for the back seat
Can you come and get me, are you coming to my track meet?""
As she begins the race of life and love I told her
""I can't run it for ya, but God know's I'ma coach ya""",https://genius.com/Common-windows-lyrics

No one knows just what's inside
Doing dope and doing time
Why they messing with your mind
Black maybe...

I heard a white man's yes is a black maybe
I was delivered in this world as a crack baby
Hard for me to pay attention and I act crazy
Gotta get over from the tip, I watch the fat lady
Sing a song, on how we guerillas in warfare
And I'm the kingest kong
They say we dreaming wrong
Them same strips that them older cats lingered on
Now the Walgreens is gone, hope is killed fiends are born
We leanin on a wall that ain't that ain't stable
It's hard to turn on the hood that made you
To leave we afraid to
The same streets that raised you can age you
With other black birds that's caged too
A rage up in Harlem and the southside
Brothers is starving with their mouth wide open
Floating across state got the workout plans so they can move weight
The fate of the black man, woman, and child: maybe

Can't come around
They gon' wanna bring you down
No one knows just what's inside
Doing dope and doing time
Why they messing with your mind

He had game since he used to hoop at Chatham
Neither the ghetto nor defenders could trap him
The stones had his back and they'd pat him
He was living a life they couldn't fathom
Colleges getting at him with all type of scholarships
Even if he went they knew he'd leave college quick
For the pros the one from the hood that was chose
The black rose that grew in the jungle
But humble stud still had rumble in his blood
Women all around giving him trouble love
You know the love when you up they down
Cause you wrap a ball they round
Your win is their crown
Dudes in the circle he known for years
Shared beers and cheers but chose different careers
When paper and fame came they ain't know how to react
Them same studs shot him in the back
Now that's black...maybe

Can't come around
They gon' wanna bring you down
No one knows just what's inside
Doing dope and doing time

When we talk about black maybe
We talk about situations
Of people of color and because you are that color
You endure obstacles and opposition
And not all the time from... from other nationalities
Sometimes it come from your own kind
Or maybe even your own mind
You get judged..you get laughed at... you get looked at wrong
You get sighted for not being strong
The struggle of just being you
The struggle of just being us... black maybe
Black maybe...

Can't come around

Forever Begins,Finding Forever,2007.0,"Victory won, in a world of Henessey and guns
Too young for the marches but I remember these drums
The stark reality of wars and battles
We fought for ours, caught in ghetto tragedy
I talk to my aunt named Mattie Lee
And recognize the importance of family
Hand me a joint, good music, and room to breathe
Those that doubt Com' will soon believe
Can't judge the weave, my lady had one
I'm more like a fool for soul and passion
The price of gas rises, street life is pumpin' fast, lives is
I watched Crash and realize that we all survivors
No religion or race could ever describe us
My guys do dirt, move dirt, but never really talk about it
Forever begins just because I thought about it

Living once again
We live
Then you're gone
Living once again
We live
Then you're gone
Living once again
We live
Then you're gone
Living once again
We live
Then you're gone

Ashes and snowfalls
I wonder when the roll call for heaven gon' come
Forever gon' come
It's a cold world and I can never go numb
Look fear in the eyes, say I never gon' run
Sooner then later, I know the cheddar gon' come
For now I write the world letters to better the young
On tree by jury, together we hung
Now we let our chains hang and gang bang to maintain
'Ghanistan goin' through the same thing
It trickles down, at each other we aim pain
I shoot for stars, peace and exclusive cars
Through the ride I learned to earn hard
Watch gangstas turn God in the midst of war
No matter how much I elevate, I kiss the floor
It was in the wind when she said Dilla was gone
That's when I knew we'd live forever through song

Living once again
We live
Then you're gone
Living once again
We live
Then you're gone

Origin is forever
Well, well well
Here we are back in the studio again
Look at that
Hey I don' need no cue cards
They got the engineers holdin up the cue cards
What that say?
Oh they say, just talk, don't sing
Son, I bet you feel like you and I've been here forever
Through these red eyes, beholding red eyes
I see my world's tears
Yeah, origin is forever
Every peak will have 2 valleys
Hopeful eyes in the comfort
Of true protection and admiration of a child
That's forever
Forever is to strive
A place of endearment
Forever is what I leave
My I-self contribution
Damn, what I'm gon' leave?
Ok...
I'll leave my one and only grain of spiritual sand
To universal scales of humanity, all humanity
Forever is finding a solution to a solution
Tsunamis, hurricanes
Following the trails of the African slave ships
War, war, and more war
Floods, Columbine, global warming, earthquakes
Another somebody done me wrong, son
Virginia Tech, is not an, ""Oh, what the heck?""
We're still, did you place your one grain
Of spiritual sand forever?
Confusion need a solution
Blend and stir, stir and blend
The pot of humanity; sift the ingredients
Of acknowledgment, apology, amendment, atonement
We gonna work with the four A's here

Niggas know they can't fuck with this
Turn this shit up just a little more

I walk the night in rhyming armor, bomb a nigga like a winter coat
Have him on Death Row searching for an Interscope
Yet I sparkle like Irene Cara
Symbolize dope, like sirens do terror
Mary Lou just had a baby someone else decapitated
Flashbacks of past raps make me so glad I made it
Players is getting traded
I drop a gem on, them who's style is jaded
My juice is grated
Shit is so banging niggas say it's gang related
On philosopher's rink of thought, I've skated with precision
Crews is getting split like decisions
Com'a let it ride and collision
Vision like Coleco or intele, I battle stars in stellar
Regions, my thought scheme was my like my offspring
Now, it's teething
My reason to rhyme applies to season and time
Seizing the mind, body and regions divine
In mom's cookouts, I'm leaving the swine
Verbal vegetarian, squash beef with Ice Cube
Came in this rap life nude
Now I'm fully clothed with flows
You tricks can't hide behind expensive cars and clothes
Old niggas I expose like Luke does hoes in videos
With classic material, imperial and rugged like
Got mag, but my slugs a mic
You fake like a smile, like a hug I'm tight
Skip ladies, this is rip a muthafucka night
Auricle air-outs, niggas don't even run for cover right
Downtown interracial lovers hold hands
I breathe heavy like an old man, with a cold can of Old Style
Hold a Stone Isle profile
Mix between Malcolm X and Sef when I go wild
Hold mics like a second nut until the second coming
Humming coming towards you with power like forwards do
Hip hop, you my bitch and like a Ford, I'm exploring you
Some wack niggas be cool, with them I stay cordial
Flow at room temperature, cats is presumed miniature
Like golf, soft like Tiger Woods
At real nigga angles I've stood with ways that's geometric
Don't need to rob banks with dyke broads to set it
I levitate to the occasion, lounge like a lyricist
Rhyme wise, you a rest haven
You sat by the door spooked like I was Wes Craven
You need to do more deleting and less saving
A praise in hell, raising heaven
As the bill on my pager leavens
What you should have known from day one
You will on day seven

When we wash all our pain away
We say, ""Oh, my Lord""
When we can't make it through the day
We pray, oh, my Lord
It's a test coming to my faith
We pray, oh, my Lord, mmh
Will my people ever be safe?
In the land that takes us and breaks us, I can't be sure

Walking with the Lord, I see footprints
My mama always told me use my good sense
Common always looking for the good sense
Since we all got good in our essence
In the hood sense, we all good anyway
That's why you always hear another dollar, 'nother day
I see the day as a new beginning
Movement of the people, movement of the women
To get the Earth spinning in the right direct
This movie of life, sometimes might project
Acts, scenes that don't seem serene
I light palo santo, put on Love Supreme
And get into the being of the great I am
That's when I get to seeing just how great I am
Many many times from mistakes, I ran
But I'm just a cake, let me bake, goddamn
I pray I don't forsake my man
And whenever I fall, on faith, I land
Imperfections, resurrections
In the mirror staring at God's reflection
Reflecting on my aggressions
On my progressions, on my obsessions
There's a lesson in not feeling less
And in seeing life itself as a blessing

When we wash all our pain away
We say, ""Oh, my Lord""
When we can't make it through the day

Giving my enemies something new to see
My community, they be fueling me
In the struggle of us, there's a unity
The moral universe stay schooling me
Will the king of kings really rule in me?
I'm an instrument, stay in tune with me
This orchestrated by Karriem, Samora, Boom, and me
If agape had a Cupid, she'd be shooting me
This rap here is fear's eulogy
Escape rooms with glasses of wine
Just another crutch for my brokenness
A term that I got from my therapist
As a black man, I feel I should be sharin' this
In the hood they say we crazy and we derelicts
But we needed for our kids and our marriages
The old folks say we don't do that
But taking care of self is the new black
Unconventional ways, unconditional ways
Mediation, mindfulness, it's just given to praise
I'm in a phase, all I see is victory
You on that wave, then come and get with me
I only want what's meant for me
And say the things that's sent to me
In penitentiaries, I met the most enlightened
Finding the losses, Heaven's excitement
I write with a force of a kid that wanted to
Be in The Source, but that changed, of course
I maintained the sauce and became a boss
I apologize if I came across
As judgmental, or self-righteous
'Cause in you, I see his likeness

When we wash all our pain away
We say, ""Oh, my Lord""
When we can't make it through the day

Well I'm a two timer of women that are three times a lady
May Sadie say Sade 
and may Ms. Goldberg say
""Yo Whoopie, there it is""
Call me E cause I equal MC squared
In the Biz, marks know I got the key, to get the girl's noses
Open like the vapors
, more pub than the papers
More papers than the press, oh yes, I gets paid

Yes, check it
I didn't grow grow up up po' po'
But once you get grown, and out on your own
Bills upon bills upon bills is what you have
Before you get your check then you already spend half
See I make money, money doesn't make me
I'm a reflection of my section and my section 8

Enough
I own 8 sections of the world, where I'm sexin' 8 girls
To have them comin' in (ohhh yes) 8 seconds
I told Victoria her secret you suck, like Sucrets
I Ultrawhite my secretary, I went to Tibet
To bet on my horse you bet your life
Mine was better and now your deader
Than a (door knob) 
eah
 wrong

(Ynot) So what's your name?
(Common) I'm the Com, the broke Com Sense
And when I don't got scratch, I do feel tense
And if you givin' your papers to a broad you'se a dummy
(Ynot) Cause without no money
""Ain't a damn thing funny""
 (3x)

Rhymes I exchange like stock, I'm live like stock
I rock like Prudential, making (haha) from O
That's mucho dinero, like Robert De Niro
A robber's dinero, 
a hero like the sandwich
A Manwich has mills like Stephanie Mills, dills like pickles
I'm fancy, man, I tickles like the French
Not 
Johnny but like Bench
 
I press on like Lee
I stan' like Lee, while you stagger like Lee
Most likely I'll dagger that bull-ish I pull ish like a magnet
Or Dragnet, I don't drag I gets net income
Yo, bums I rush like adrenaline
I'm royal when I flush, your highest hush'll get mushed
Like a sleigh dog, I slay dogs who are under me
I'm over men; call me Doberman, cause I'm a Pinscher of pennies
That's pretty, leave your city green from all the money I spent
I stay fresh like a mint from mint
I meant my mint, know what I mean? I'm nice
Real friendly like an officer, friendly and a gentleman
Friendly like neighbors, not Jim
But like Gomer I got piles of loot
Attention salute, I kill loot but won't dilute
Even if I threw garbage on the ground I couldn't pollute
Man, I'm too rich for that, bitch!
(Ynot got the money)

(Common) So what's your name?
(Ynot) I'm Ynot, I own a mansion and a yacht
I got essentials and credentials and honeys at my feet
And when I walk the street, I'm never lookin' bummy
(Common) Cause without the money
""Ain't a damn thing funny"" (5x)

Ynot, let me tell ya a story
Okay it was a black man a white man and a Chinese man
The black man of course he was po' (yeah)
The white man, he was rich (uh-huh)
And the Chinese man, he owned a sto' (aight c'mon)
Okay the black man lived on Beat Street
The white man lived on Wall Street
And at the Chinese man's store is where they all meet
Not really on the good foot
Cause the white man kept steppin' on the black man's toes (damn!)
And in his shoes there were holes
But the white man didn't care, shit;
He didn't have to wear it (uh-uh)
The scratch that he had, he got from his parents
With his tight ass, he woulda been poor white trash, but anyway
Everyday the black man would ask him to spare change
But at him, the white man would stare strange
So the black man got fed up
Cause wasn't nobody feedin' him and feedin' him
And took red by his neck and started beatin' him and beatin' him
The Chinese man got 'noid and broke out like a peon
And now the black man own the store
And the name of it is Leon's
(...What's that?)
Barbecue, that is! (Oh...)
Rib tips, hotsauce, mild sauce, fries, and chicken

(Common) So what's your name?
(Ynot) I'm Ynot, I own a mansion and a yacht
I got essentials and credentials and honeys at my feet
And when I walk the street, I'm never lookin' bummy
(Common) Cause without the money

Raised by game where niggas ain't phased by fame
Come to the crib, get banged, they take your chain
Stay in your lane, Brokeback ain't the way of the game
My brainstorm is like I stay in the rain
My favorite was Kane, now I'm dope with weight in the game
You was hot but can't stay in the flame
Ghetto pain and windows crack
, the fist is like a symbol for black
Can tell the real by how the real interact
In the middle of whack my soul sticks to a track
Kickback records get kicked to the back
I want big cribs and my man Ronnie to get his
Child in a good school and know what her gift is
It's global warming, the world is shifting
Watching Sweet Sixteen, Bitchin-ass rich kids
Who don't know in life you gotta go the distance
Whether yoga or doja, we all get lifted in the Game

I never kissed the ass of the masses, I'm the black molasses
Thick and I lasted past these rat bastards
They try to box me in like Cassius Clay
Hey I'm like Muhammad when he fasted
Opposing the fascist, make cuts and got gashes
Scratches over third eyelashes
Punchlines are like jab hits to rappers
Whose careers now ashes it's too many slashes
In his name, came in the game these gun-clappers
From weak lines to clothing lines to an actress
I seen 'em dashing smash hits
I yell run nigga run while I cook up classics
The weak hearted, become Babylon puppets
Making it hard for real hustlas
Touch the sky now and then, with a lady friend
Give thanks to the most that's how the day begins in the game

I just wanna be like Akeelah, an achiever
From the streets of the Chi where some get high for leisure
Selling weed out of cleaners
From rocks to barber shops and beemers
Chicks with blond weaves and strong legs like Serena
The demeanor of the Ghetto, to never stay settled
Aldermen and corrupt men play Pharaoh
GOOD bring business to the hood like Harolds
Five year olds walking by them self in the street
The young die of cancer, I stop eating meat
Greet the gods on 87th St. like peace
Even though it's war to G, got 'em facing the east
The game ain't tasting as sweet
Cats flow is still, and they complacent with beats
My radio station is deep, so eff 'em
Progression, counting paper and blessings in the game

Pyramids,Black America Again,2016.0,"A nigga told me only rhyme for 19-year-olds
Nigga, you should rhyme wherever the spirit goes
Here it goes, lyrical miracles
These are pyramids from the imperial
In theory though, low end scenario
And sound boy burial drove me to classic material
Aerial nights blew my mind out of stereotypes
For ethereal heights, I write like Richard
Invisible man,
 pictured below
With 
the hieroglyphicable prolifical flow
On the walls where the mystics of Kemet would go
Supreme wisdom in my system is the 
kick in the door
I don't rhyme for the sake of riddlin' though
This is a ritual for those depicted as low
Now I passed life like I've been here before
The reincarnation of 
It Takes A Nation Of Millions To Hold
Us Back
, coldest raps, for me, the globe is like a culdesac
Around the world in a day, 
find forever
 and I stay
I'm from the weather where they spray, 
there's gotta be a better way
People dying every day, wonder what would heaven say
Devils need to get away
From Chevrolet to Escalade, from evergreen to the everglades
I kneel where the rebels prayed
Seen 50 grey, but they need better shades
Niggas rhymin' like their whole style in retrograde
, 
the escapade I'm on
Is like when the sun, moon and stars was born
It's hard to explain how these pyramids formed

Talent that I got will riz-ock the spot
MCs I'll be burning, burning hot
Talent that I got will riz-ock the spot
MCs I'll be burning, burning hot
Talent that I got will riz-ock the spot
MCs I'll burn, I'll burn, and I will burn, burn, burn

I arrived on the planet, never took the Southside for granted
Smoke a little, keep a high standard
The Roots are my niggas so got a fly band with
Son of the sit-ins, you know who I stand with
Dude said I was a hero, I ain't nothing but a sandwich
A gluten-free one at that, close my eyes see my raps
My bio is feedback from what we need rap
On some Marshawn Lynch, let me run it back
And come with that new black spiritual
Every rap's a miracle, condition now critical
Can't lack lyrical, we need black generals
Holy war, tap into you like Savion
But I'm a orator, the corduroy boy
Came the door-to-door name down the corridor of fame
I walk like an Egyptian
 on a mission to listen to conditions
Envision a vision of what we wishing
I've been commissioned to deprison the prism of your mind
Spit the wisdom of the one devine
Close encounter of the wonder kind, front a line
Shift the paradigm with a pair of rhymes
Styled by Michaela in the suite with Caroline
Getting dressed up under pressure, 
Alabama Shakes on
Incense rising from the dresser
Child of a fresher God
Influenced by the life of the former, Joanne Chesimard
Assata Shakur
, I gotta do more
The light-skinned spook who got in the door
I got in here for the same thing Cassius Clay uses pottery for
I'm on a world tour with Muhammad the prophet, my man
And where we land the pyramids stand

MCs I'll be burning, burning hot

With a little communism

Chick-a chick-a I'm
Chick-a chick-a on
Chick-a chick-a my
My, own shit
Like an entrepreneur, that stepped in manure
Man I'm newer than a Jack I went up the hill with Jill
And Jack Jill's big bootay
We did the booty up, I told the Bitch she Betta Have My Money
Or step to the AMG
You know Com Sense, oh yeah him be
That nigga that be making all the bid-by-by-bye sounds
But since then, Common calm down!
I'm on some calm shit watch Com get complicated
Simple motherfuckers say the way that Com communicated
Was too complex, I got a complex not to complain
On my brain no complain and so will my community
And I prefer compliments
So I complement at an angle, of ninety degrees
It's the nineties, and music got known for the grease
I got a sense of direction and a compass
Com passed emcees with no compassion, though I heard the screams of
But I ain't shy, so why shall I comfort?
Com should have been at the fort with Jeff I'm so ill
But I chilled in my compartment with no company and no meals
Now Com could get the penny, but I want my own company
And Com is on a mission not to work for commission
It's a common market and it's so much competition
But to me, competition is none
To my comp I'm a ton I get amped like Watts in a riot
My compact disc is a commodity, so buy it
Instead of competing with Pete
Com compromised, Com made a promise
Not to commercialize, but compound the soul
With other elements, compelling sense into Communism",https://genius.com/Common-communism-lyrics
Rewind That,Nobody’s Smiling,2014.0,"Rewind that one time please
Rewind that one time please

Should it be, can it be simple?
Life is like the tempo of a No-I instrumental
Things that we been through define who we are now
Since ""Can I Borrow a Dollar?""
Ooh, I'm a star now, coming from Chi-town
We was the first to do it
Me, No I.D., Twilite Tone on the music
The city on our back, we was the opening act
Throw our tapes in the crowd, they throw 'em right back
But we stayed on track, they stayed on the tracks
I stayed on the raps 'til we made it on the map
By then, No I was my main guy
He and I was like Chi-town's Gang Starr
We had came far together, with a long way to go
Seeing a bigger picture, but now from different angles
Tangle of the hustling, survival in the game
Felt I had to leave home to be a household name
Show money low, needin' to stack fast
City did have my back, now it's a backlash
Was I a slave to the cash and wanting it so bad?
I just became a dad, rap was all I had
So I moved to New York, to make it pop
Did Like Water for Choc, that album changed a lot
But my man who I started with, wasn't a part of it
And his presence I didn't even acknowledge it
Knew I was wrong, he shoulda at least had a song
It wouldn't be me without No I.D., and Twilite Tone
Wishin' I could get that time back
Oh I can, yo man, rewind that
Me and Dion back in the zone, I'm doing shows with Tone
For the future of the Chi we gon' bring it back home
Rewind that and we could do it again
No I.D., Twilite Tone, where the story begin

Rewind that one time please
Rewind that one time please

This one's for my man J Dilla
As I say these words, my eyes fill up
Cuz wasn't non' realer than James  Dewitt Yancey
So I'mma dedicate this to Dilla and his family
In Q-Tip's basement, I first met Jay Dee
I still remember the first beat he played me
He came to the Chi laid three that was crazy
Didn't even know me and gave 'em to me for free
I got the the D, ""peace yo, big love""
Cook up some hot shit, then go to the strip club
Then we made ""The Light"" and times got brighter
I said ""turn it up"" Jay'll take it higher
One day, I noticed he was tired quick
That's when I found out, Jay Dee was real sick
Things got worse before they got better
I said, ""Come to L.A. for peace and good weather""
We got an apartment just so we could spark it
MP in the front room, records in the closet
The beats got iller, but the sickness was still there
I'm wishing I could will him out of his wheelchair
It was hard for me to come home every day
And see my homie Jay's life fade away
I stayed away some times, in other words I ran
Til one day J brought me this TV stand
It was a gift so I couldn't refuse it
It came from his heart, I regret I didn't use it
The lupus got worse and, for what it's worth
I wanted him to have a Grammy before he left this earth
Wishing we could have that time back
Oh we can, yo man, rewind that

Rewind that one time please
Rewind that one time please

You never gone, you live forever through song
I feel it when I seem 'em with them Dilla shirts on
I know you're still shining, from heaven you watch me
Watch me put this Grammy on the stand you got me

(Common)
That's the infinite team right there, me and Jay Dee, I'mma work with him whenever I can, cause he's just like, constantly progressing and growing. He's one of the greatest producers... greatest musicians of our time. For real, I really know that
Like, I used to be able to wake up in the morning and hear J Dilla beats being made. You know, I really, really used to walk by and be like, ""Man, I'm blessed."" I really felt that, like, during the time when he was making it, not like, I don't look back and have to say ""I was blessed, I know I was blessed."" But during that time I looked and say man, I'm gonna see Jay Dee make beats every day, you know, as long as he was healthy, he was making music

Invocation,One Day It’ll All Make Sense,1997.0,"Envisioning the hereafter, listening to Steve Wonder
On a quest for love like the Proceed drummer
I strike like lightning and don't need thunder
Inhale imagination and breathe wonder
That's your lady, I used to run up in her and G weed from her
It's a cold world and niggas need summer
At times my going forward seems like retreat
As I rewrite rhyme after rhyme and throw away beats
Growing into my britches, outgrowing the streets
There's a thin line between war and peace, whores and jeeps
Ignore MCs like beeps, scribbling freedom on pages
My third eye is like pink eye, seen and contagious
Redeeming the ancients with ageless rhyme jargon
I feel Mexican, hip hop is my garden
Don't give a fuck where you charting, certain shit I can't honor
It ain't that you selling, it's your karma
Rappers I monitor like a chaperone, you large and haven't grown
Poetically perform live-bys, another rapper gone
The stage becomes a catacomb, I rap like a mummy
Not for the money, I could have sampled Diana Ross a long time ago
My mind of flow is like motor key 20
Youngblood said he had dimes, I prayed that he see twenty
Hollering at the brothers, either you gon' be a thug or a man
Flip drugs and get land
I can see my man was tired as he described how the bucks hit him
And said slugs was still stuck in him, when it rained, it fucked with him
This bucket interrupt wisdom and asked when my album was coming

These nuggets, these nuggets, these nugget ugget uggets
With some peas and a hole in the bucket (cool, cool)
Dear Liza, Minelli, I jam like jelly 
and I got
Helly what, helly what, helly rhymes
I can remember times when for a 40 I had to beg for bucks
Nobody really gave a, so I had to beg for fucks
Now what do niggas do when they got not food
Skibbidy skap and busta bust a rap
So I pick up the pen and then begin the thoughts to get to pumpin
Hopin like all the people let me talk, let me say somethin
Cause nothin for nothin leaves nothin, I got nuthin to lose
I put, nuttin in my notes, I'm not your host when I got nuttin to use
Dues gettin credited, now I debit my bank account
Not on a blind date, could I see me taken out
By some glutteus, glutteus, maximus, maximus
I'm spas-ta-gis-a-mister-gis a mister-gis-ta-spas-ta-gis
Spectacular, the papes I Count like Dracula
You can't cut the rug, because you suck, MC Vacumn Up
Rappers I stiff arm like Walter Payton
Their ain't no way or half-step, and flex a rhyme like a bicep
Some steps with concepts, but umm, WHO cares
Not even the damn 
People Under the Stairs

Interruption, interruption
True b-boys runnin shit
Unamerican Caravan, beatin you down

I'm comin around the mountain high as lower than a valley
I'm the cat, from the alley, from the back, I'mma rally
And tally up points, rollin joints, risin to the tops
Somewhat of a playwright, cause like a stage I got props
My crew's a strange brew, a drink a day'll keep the stink away
We been through AA, but hey, what can I say?
Say say say, what you want, but you'll pay the con-se-quences

Even if your name ain't Ripley, cause Ripley don't know diddley
Hit me one time, two times, for the U-AYYY-C
Heyyyyyy, but anyway
I hit a skid, and I peel out like MC Eiht, damn I kill it
Earn my money the old fashioned way - I steal it
Stop thief in the temple, I hit em with a blow
Somebody done stole my beeper but I'mma steal the show
I'm throwin a Heidi Ho into a bro and tellin her
Go for what you know bruh, the people before me go under
Yo we gotta gotta get we gotta get we gotta get
Gotta get, gotta gotta gotta get get over
Somewhere over the rainbow, I'm still the same old same old
Ringin around the collar, borrowin a dollar, check my balls
Dirty drawers, see the kitty suckin titties
Video watchin lush from the city
I'm the extra-terrestrial, rappers phone home
 cause they have to
Them marks be callin', Ork, come in Ork, Nanu Nanu
The perfect stranger, comin in to a, fuck a new land

It was a dream day, met her on spring break
Look like the type that be like ""No hable inglés""
She said you look like you rap, where's your bling'e?
And yours clothes is tight but you don't seem gay
I said naw, thats dude from NSYNC'e
She wasn't married, kept her ring on her pinky
She said ""You know I dont be datin' rappers""
I said I got my SAG card, baby I'm an actor


Seen her again at All Star weekend, she ain't have tickets
And she ain't into hoopers, she was there to kick it
With her roommate who was a video vixen
Spend so much on outfits she's about to get evicted
Said ""I'm married to this rap shit, looking for a mistress""
You can be by my side like Flavor and Delicious
Long as you ain't scared of the kitchen and the dishes
She said ""you one of them fishes, I know your mind switches"", and


Time revolve, 
we fell in love as crazy as Nas
And them broads was textin cuz I stop calling them
I met the parents, watch the game with her father and
Questions of marriage and I start dodging them
What happen to me happens to lots of men
Get deep in love and then your needing some oxygen
As far as wives I was thinking like Solomon

Uh huh, with the ya ya, yeah

I thought we would record something tonight
And I do want to dedicate it to two very outstanding people
I live the spirit of
Gentlemen Crispus Attucks and Mr. Marcus Garvey
Thank you so much
The Believer
If I were a believer, I believe I would believe in the beginning
Everybody's beginning
Mine, that my very first ancestors were front row and present
When God stepped to the mic
I believe from the creation of the Garden of Eden
The separation of the tribes
Our long marches across the desert
Being Yacub's kids
For instincts born in caves of ice
All, each and every one, the souls of one God
Granted earthly existence to allow each to earn
The blessing of transcending, time-traveling throughout the universe
With the blessings and well-wishes of my fathers, prophets of my own
No search, no fear no mysteries
We inherit the power to turn nightmares into dreams
For those of us who come from less than enviable circumstances
Dreams, good dreams, sweet dreams, dreams come true
Truthful dreams, truthful dreams become life
Life becomes belief, belief becomes live!
Live the life you believe
The American dream, the black American dream, the universal dream
For the sake of the unwritten laws of humanity, I believe in God
I believe in my ancestors, I believe in my offsprings
I believe in Dr. Sebi, I believe we must stop Willie Lynch'n each other
I believe in the truth, truth
See you next lifetime",https://genius.com/Common-pops-belief-lyrics
The Day Women Took Over,Black America Again,2016.0,"There's something 'bout this day that seem good to me
When niggas I ain't like is showin' love to me
Good food and the mood and the hood is free
Peace and free is the frequency
This is the day women took over
No longer over your shoulder do you have to look over
Imagine, war is now over
Mothers get medals for being courageous soldiers
On dollars, it's Michelle Obama, Oprah and Rosa
The mayor of the Chi is Liz Dozier
Hoods feel safer, families feel closer
We all drunk in love with no need to be sober
Ladies get their hair done, and men, we notice
You get high grade Indian weaves, at the lowest
Prices, chivalry is no longer lifeless
We openin' doors and pullin' out chairs again
Things are merry and there's more marryin'
Monthly free doses of Motrin and Valerian
For your menstrual, it's no more minstral shows
Depictin' women as ignorant simple hoes
It's more love songs on the radio
Respect for the ladies, you can hear it in the flow
Egos aside, for each other we rise
Since they done give us a life, the whole world feel alive

Oh, when women take over the world
Oh, every man, woman, boy and girl
Oh, maybe one day, we will see
Peace and unity the way it's meant to be

The day women took over, let it continue
Now women get paid as much as men do
Dr. Angelou's lookin' from Heaven's window
Tellin' young girls phenomenal woman is in you
Body is a temple, men don't prey
Mother earth's arms around you sayin' it's okay
Toilet seats down, that's a no-brainer
Monuments in Washington of Fanny Lou Hamer
Harriet, Sojourner's truth is marchin' on
Women preachers and world leaders, it now the norm
Healthcare, payin' for nails, jails and fill-ins
Intellectual buildin', intersexual healin'
No stickin' movers, and no quick shooters
After 15 minutes, callin' you a Uber
The New World Order is fathers lovin' their daughters
And baby's mamas supported and ladies gettin' courted
In court, kids can't be tried as adults
And women, they called bitches because they a boss
In all shapes and sizes, beauty is recognized
Goddess and queens is what we use to describe
Now Michelle Alexander wrote the new constitution
Beyoncé made the music for the revolution
Imagine it, a world more compassionate
The balance of the feminine and masculine, I'm askin' if

Oh, what if women took over the world
Oh, every woman, boy and girl
Oh, maybe one day, we will see
Peace and unity the way it's meant to be",https://genius.com/Common-the-day-women-took-over-lyrics
Congratulations,UnKnown,2013.0,"Flowers bloom, the early part of June
Noon is the time
Stay in tune, there's a lot going through my mind
Got up this morning, smelling like fumes of wine
My man had his bachelor's, an exclusive time
We're getting ready now, he 'bout to walk the aisle
A pimp's funeral, but we're gon' walk in style
I'm feeling proud, yet I'm feeling funny
And it ain't cause his niggas still owe me money
Cause it's my buddy here
We've been through lots of years
Lot of beers, lots of fights, lots of nights
Dreams about our career
Now we're here in these tuxes
I remember back when we was hustlers
Move work, doing dirt, girls say we ho'ed around
Still doing it, we're just older now
Fixing his bow-tie, his collar, I fold it down
I'm the best man, I'm supposed to hold it down
We're sober now, but I'mma be lit tonight
One of these bridesmaids, I might have to hit tonight
He said ""The Light"" is his first song, I'm honored
It's already been drama, she don't like his momma
Maybe that's karma, huh, he's a good cat
A good cat ain't supposed to be with a hoodrat
I knew her back, back, when we went to FAMU
And like a black college, a lot of niggas ran through
Scandalous, the type you can't trust
Whatever you get her is just never enough
Plus, about her, I know too much stuff
Of being straight bogus, she's on the cusp
I'mma hush, cause today is his big day
These colors we're wearing, yeah they're a bit gay
But anyway, I told him when we first started
Now we must toast for the sincerely departed
Am I being jealous-hearted, I'm debating
Maybe cause my guy's in love, I'm just hating
We're waiting on Reverend Clayton and for her to get ready
The church bells is ringing and the ring is real heavy
Heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy

You remember that, man
You remember that, yo
Yo, I ain't even, I ain't even gonna lie
Yeah, I can't really make it in step with this girl
Nah man, it's what a man's gotta do
It's a good thing for you, man
Yeah, we gon', yeah
It's gonna be right

It's a Black wedding, you know it started late
Family members arguing on who gon' get a plate
His relatives saying they just can't relate
To her being his Mrs., it's a big mistake
I feel the same way, I'm tryna be supportive
It's hard when I think of ball players she then courted
But I ain't gonna agitate, I congratulate
It's like a weave, half is real, half is fake
They knew the caterer, so they got it half the rate
Her father, Mr. Cook, looking like he half baked
Pimped out in red velvet, his suit match the cape
Looking at his watch, damn, how much these pastors make?
But wait, oh shit, there go his ex-girl Shawna
Man, I hope it don't be no drama
That lady in the big hat, that's his grandmama
For him taking a step, I at least gotta honor
Cause maybe she changed, and I'm just tripping
We're walking down the aisle, the CD is skipping
I read between the lines, see, that's the sign
Kind of mixed about when it will be my time
To settle down
Her little niece Sherice throwing petals down
Looking at marriage
Narrow is the aisle, as they were saying their vows
A ghetto phone went off with the song all loud
Wiping my brow, cause now I'm nervous
She looking beautiful in her dress, I'm looking at her curves
It's natural to look, I try to look off
He said, speak or hold your peace, I gave a good cough
""Are you serious?"" The reverend smelling filthy
But on the real, I'm the one feeling guilty
Cause if this was court and I had to tell the truth
I should have told my man before he said I do

I gotta tell you what's good, think it's all bad
I congratulate you like it's all that
Got my dress, I'll stand up for your celebration
Even though it's love imitation
Imitation, imitation
Imitation
Congratulations, my man
For real, good luck with that
Hey, you can't appreciate the sunshine
If it never rains
And it's gonna rain",https://genius.com/Common-congratulations-lyrics

cause see, I'm like Bowser
Kickin it with the sha-na-na-na, the t-shirt
And the trousers,

I'm left with the gift, open it up, SURPRISE!
Big Mac, filet-o-fish, quarter pounder, french fries
Icy Coke, milkshake, sundaes and apple pies
And a cup? Nah, that's enough of that

Wild, tried to live how I had to fluctuate
To a state, and matriculate, yo I had to elevate
You can tell it's great, cause I'm state
Off 87, the South side of Chicago
Five-oh-one come follow me yo, everywhere that I go
And I know I ain't did nothing 
The district think I be just a lil trick kid fronting
UAC got my back if there's any contact
In the back is a track from Immenslope soul cat
And it's phat, sorta like Oprah before she lost weight
I put my rhymes in good hands, hey like All State
And I'm all in a state of ease, utopia
I'm the Spiderman, givin bug MC's arachnaphobia

Break her arm and feather, whipping the wonder when she activates
Hold up! My drawers are in my crack,  pass the tape
Time to activate, and ejaculate
This is the period where I menstruate (What!?)
I meant to say demonstrate
I'm in a state, where I've had too much eight, ball
In the corner pocket, count em, buck it

We the only ones in the house
I can help you body wind down
Make this bottle disappear right now
Get comfortable, comfortable
Get comfortable, comfortable
Get comfortable, comfortable
Let's stay in for the night
Maybe take a walk outside
Let's distance your pride
Me fall in love with your mind
If I look deep in your eyes
I can guess your zodiac sign
We ain't got nothing but time
We can just chill and unwind
Get comfortable, comfortable
Get comfortable, comfortable
Get comfortable, comfortable

Freedom is the road less traveled by the multitude
The mood, it's the mode, it's the culture
Where there's food there's vultures
More Tony now, back then I was Sosa
I was sent like a penny in a loafer
The 2Pac Deepak Chopra
On a plane drinking wine with Oprah
When I missed the dap I ain't mean to insult her
Black Caesar, ey o amo roma
Tuto biene vino rosa
My dominican girl she loves soca
Take her to Minetta take her to the MOCA
Most of my friends at home that I'm close to
When they talk, put it on stone like a sculpture
Used to be a hooper, now I'm a hoper
Thoughts I bring to life like an ultra sound
I'm bound to the underground
Breaking walls down for the black and brown
A activist is active now
How far will you go for exposure?
Little homie in the paint tryna post up
Don't make me have to put you on a poster
Posterized by what I vocalize
Weathered the storm like I know the skies
Yea we wear the mask but I know no disguise
These signs of the times are notarized
Written by the lord of the skies mortalized
In us, I got cold through cruel winters
Grandmas, defenders, Fred Hamptons agenda
Never been good with pretenders
They lying on the king like Simba
Dinner, branzino and red wine
Quality shared time
Fucking and laughing 'til its bed time

Red like my lips
Blue like past thoughts
Brown like your eyes
Just enough time
I can't think now
You're too close and I…
Might be too nice
These New York nights
Got me taking chances
I think your hands
Might look just right
If they held mine
Get comfortable, get comfortable
Get comfortable, get comfortable
Get comfortable, get comfortable
Get comfortable, get comfortable
Get two glasses
Now I'm swimming
Off the deep end
Heightened senses
No pretending
Make my head spin
I like dancing
In my bedroom
It's just me and you
Put that tape on
Tell me what you want
Let's just make time feel, long
Get comfortable, get comfortable
You could just stay for the night
Here, let me turn down the lights
Get comfortable, get comfortable
You can let go
Passion comes from down below
We go together like so
Get comfortable, get comfortable

And check it out, ha

My raps do laps around tracks and adapt
To any environment.. I'm the comma comma chameleon
I use to pop a wheelie on my blue and gray stingray, it had mags
That was when bitches had Gucci bags
And wasn't rockin' Starters, looking harder than niggas
Hoes wore clothes, that exposed they figures
8-7 stepped in the jam, next the police come
Fights there would be one, numbers I'd get at least one
We'd come to the get-together with whoever
You wouldn't know how deep we was, we all didn't sit together
Eat up all your vittles, drink your brew
And then step to the next cue, let's do it again y'all
That was when mad was tall and phat was cold
The days of Old Chicago and Fun Town
As shorties we run 'round, play strike outs till sun down
But the shit ain't as fun now, and the city's all run down
We'd troop down to Jew Town, talk a cat down on some gear
Have enough for a Polish and car fare
I stare, at what use to be better
And think about who use to cop our liquor
(Who?) Our neighborhood father figure

I'm out with my crew, ain't nuthin' to do but uh

Ain't nowhere to go, so I hook up with a ho while I
(Niggas be rollin)
Gotta make a stop, take a leak and get some tops, cause um

We gonna hit the streets for some brew and some eats cause umm

I got more rhymes than The Manor got folks
Had style since I went to McDowell, wearin' boats
And penny loafers though I had the nickel in mines
We use to hoop in my yard but now I dribble the rhyme
It's like rain drops couldn't make our game stop
Skeeter would hit from the same spot
'til Marlon tore my shit down, get down
Put your body in motion only the strong survive
But on the 6 or the 5
Live is how the sets used to be, at the Racquet
Ball Club with music by, Andre Hatchett
Or either a beat by Pharris at them country club parties
We'd be hot as hell and House studs would yell ""Aight, now money!""
Sauers I would go there, hip-hop clubs were so rare
I liked the music anyways and it was always hoes there
Whitney Young and Kenwood was said to have the best chicks
But mostly Hyde Park and V hoes is who I messed with
The best shit was troopin' to the loop in your precisions
Cut class to get ass, but still go to division (I remember that)
Over Yamela's crib while his old girl was at work
Bust a spoolie on the spread, but still have some on your shirt

I'm out with my crew, ain't nuthin' to do but uh

Ain't nowhere to go, so I hook up with a ho while I

Gotta make a stop, take a leak and get some tops, cause um

We gonna hit the streets for some brew and some eats cause umm

I tuned into BMX, and taped Farley on the tonemaster
Took the 6 instead of the 28 to get home faster
Then HPK was the only station that would fuck with rap
You was on The Shore by yourself cats'd (would) say ""Up your hat.""
What you could you'd make of it, if you was a gump they'd take your shit
Either fight or break for it, we'd go to the lake and get full
My drink then was Boone's and Red Bull
I remember swimming in Avalon, and peeing in the pool
I thought I was cool, with my ""Members Only"" and a 
bald fade
Walk to Walgreens to get the Sportin' Waves pomade
And soft brush, as we got older we 
would stalk, rush, and bang fags
Go to Marshall's and change tags, I snagged 'nuff niggas
In games of Off the Wall
, and softball, 
""Piggy one""
 I would call
When I first got my three way callin', I caught marks tryin' to lie
Home of the original gangbangers, and ain't nobody shy

I'm out with my crew, ain't nuthin' to do but uh
(Niggas be rollin)
Ain't nowhere to go, so I hook up with a ho while I

No mustaches, no beards
Probably had the same aspirations as his
On a mission, staring in the distance
It never stop like the Muslims and Christians
We under-21 gun salute them
Just to go back and recruit them
I'm talkin' 'bout war

To all the killas and the hundred dolla billas
Real hittas who ain't got no feelins

There's a war going on inside, no man is safe from, goin on
Going on, there's a war going on inside, no man is safe from
Or can escape from, take one wars from the same place that hate from
Gang wars used to be about the nations
Now it's cliques with clips and hittas is missing
They hit the innocent now they families miss him
Death do kissed him, in his last breath he wishing
But no option so he assume position
It don't stop, hittas killing women and children
Angels cried, that's supposed to be God's decision
Collisions of cliques named after rap groups
Except wearing Jordans instead of black boots
Black troops trade war stories reminiscent of Glory
Walk the walk of those before me since I was a shorty
Seen slugs and drugs and unemployment
Terror town y'all was my first deployment
The life of a soldier ain't nothing to toy with
I'm living in this shit while the world exploit it
War


My basic training was aiming, hustling, banging, changing niggas up
Cause of what they did to us, nigga, I don't give a fuck
It's do or die in the Chi and I ain't lived enough
Hoping for some visitors of war, I'm a prisoner
Politicians they did enough, want to get rid of us
Hopped in the back as soon as the shots hit the truck
Looked at my son I could see his soul
Shot and killed at three years old

War, war, war, war!
We are at war!

The direction was we, we came up with this concept, Nobody Smiling was really a thought that came about because of all the violence that was going on in Chicago, or that is going on. I like to say ""was"" cause we gon' bring it to fruition wishing that it's gonna stop. You know and uh, all the violence that was going on - it happens in Chicago but it's happening around the world in many ways. You know, it may not be to the numbers that's happening in Chicago but it's happening in the inner cities all over America so we's talking about the conditions of what's happening when I said ""Nobody Smiling"" but it's really a call to action",https://genius.com/Common-war-lyrics

Say you got guns, then bring that shit
Say you got ones, then bring that shit
Cause you need a lot more ones and guns for this
Me and my mans is bout to spit some hot shit
Yeah, one two
Bout to spit that, hot shit
Huh whoo! Yeah
Turn it down nigga, hot shit
Yea

Messenger in the Metropolis; apocalypse here and now
Niggas know the ledge, so they don't come near the style
I appear in clouds on some heaven to earth shit
Fake niggas drown the deeper the verse gets
Deep as a skinny girl's cunt - I surface with the purpose
To let y'all niggas know the demo
Voice is a instrument that's monumental
You couldn't fuck with the style if you was a nympho
Raised in the temple of Chi,
 taught to look into the eye
I identify with dobbs and weaves, and niggas makin moves
That bob and weave, and niggas with jobs on the side sell weed
I feed off the hunger that a bum or abandoned child gets
Freaky, like Marv Albert
, in outfits, by Chaka Givens
I lecture how I got God but don't got religion
Got a clip for these niggas on the net, sellin my shit
Let's just say you Ramone and I'm Spit
In a habitat of Cadillacs and battle raps
And people that travel at the speed of need
Never agree with the ways of the world
Cats say anything - like they say to they girl
How you bringin it when you sit Indian style?
Niggas know me as Com it's time hear me go wild
With hot shit, yeah
Hot shit, yeah, one two
Came to bring it boy

You say you got ones, then bring that shit
Cause you need a lot more ones and guns for this

What? No doubt hot shit

Old men see visions young men dream dreams
I rock the planet - 
recognize - I'm the C.R.E.A.M
Com Rules Everything
 and everything is
How yo' man pullin yo' weight - he ain't carryin his
Scary the biz is like ""The Blair Witch Project""
Experiment in rooms on some bare bitch project
State senators, life twirls, most sell out
- like a dread with a white girl
You want me to cypher with you and the Gods?
I just did a show - I'm pursuin these broads
Everyone I ain't tryin to fuck
Wanna feel female presence and conversation a touch
You'll get split like a date that's dusk scuffed and scraped up
Taped up for tryin to say what - ever you was about to say
You rap like a nigga that's about to spray
Get a mouth shot, for openin your mouth to say
Feel my heat in the night - it leaves you without the day
What I write is a passage for niggas to travel through
Before defeatin me - Joe, you better battle you
I tap into my own zone like it's my home phone
Turn the cell off and let my dome roam
Shame I gotta do white labels to keep my life stable
I write fatal bringin niggas to life
A wise man came in the thick of the night
He said BRING THAT SHIT when you pick up the mic
I said, ""What shit?""
He said HOT SHIT, hot shit, hot shit

Little Chicago Boy,Black America Again,2016.0,"How should I begin?
This is the story of a boy named Lonnie Lynn
As I say it, the spirits enwhip me
He was raised in the belly of the city
Chicago, discovered by du Sable
A Black Frenchman that I had to mention
Extensions of a young man livin' on a low end
47th and Michigan, lackin' a little discipline
Know Grandma Mable did the best she could
You know how young niggas want a testy hood
There he stood, taller than most black boys
One of the best ballers out of Illinois
College in Ohio, this is like his bio
Talks that we had, man, they was never idle
He talked about readin' the Quran and the Bible
He talked how he smoked dope and sold it for survival
He talked about the ancestors, in our lives; they're vital
He said y'all niggas love the bang 'cause you tribal
Spiral of life, Chicago to Denver
Anywhere he went, of attention, he's the center
6'9"", big heart, big mind
He he spent a lifetime tryin' to be big time
He did in a way, he made to the ABA
And the things he say on my record
When I was a shawty, he bought me ""The Message""
It was his messages in the life I would step with
Didn't see him much, spirits are connected
The Father creates it, the son can reflect it
His perspective: sometimes seemed crazy
His perspective: sometimes seemed brilliant
His perspective: somehow it shaped me
His perspective: undoubted I feel it
He'd walk around in them Air Jordans I gave him
I said, ""Pops, them from Mike, man, you better save 'em""
The fight that he had with cancer was a brave one
Took Dr. Sebi's herbs instead of medication
Breathing heavy, he talked reparations
He said, ""Son, we live through our generations""
Offspring, coughing, Gene Ammons playing
In the background, he was talking, I was praying
Our Father, take care of my father
As far as he went, may I go farther
May our dreams and legacies live through our children
Though I can't touch him, I can still feel him

You know the other day I got a phone call. I got a message says pops you been gon from home too long. So I set my bags down and headed to 87th street. I was just back in the neighborhood ya know cruising the same street that I used to cruise in my long black Fleetwood. Listening to the Minister and Dr. King and my beloved brother Malcolm. First thing is see I'm boundless with spiritual energy. I wanna talk about the moral necessities of human justice. The power and the action of God-given dignity. One can not enter the gate if you hate. You gotta take the lead for the rest of the world, 87th is the street of knowledge. The streets of knowledge are all over the world. We got a possibility again of leading the world. Chi my Chi we gon ask you for safe passage for the kids to walk to school. Alright, my young homies, we got a mission to finish. We got the unborn that we got to provide the truth for

I gotta be honest it's so much different without you here
But I have no fear
I'll see you when I get there
To that city bright and fair
You were all I needed you to be
And now I thank you for all you gave for me
So Father, I stretch my hands to Thee
No other help I know
If you withdraw yourself from me
Somebody tell me where, oh where shall I go?
Father, I stretch my hands to Thee
No other help I know
If you withdraw yourself from me
Tell me where, oh where shall I go?",https://genius.com/Common-little-chicago-boy-lyrics
(Lately) I’ve Been Thinking,America Is Dying Slowly ,1996.0,"Intro: Common
Yeah, one two, bless
Yeah yeah, check it
I got my mellow Sean Lett
He gonna get down for y'all Chicago style
Eighty-seven, you know the bidness, check it
Chorus: Common, Sean Lett
After eight years of my life, of smoking and drinking
The world keeps spinning, so lately I've been thinking
After eight years of my life, of smoking and drinking
The world keeps spinning, so lately I've been thinking
Verse One: Common
Nearest to the go gothic, a cash flow prophet
Methods of gettin scratch and talkin slick I've adopted
Palms in the lock with stunts whose hearts be game
Hoes in the stable, none do I claim
Niggas with nothin to shoot for, at they only aim
Gramps in the choir singin it's gonna rain
In the midst of precipitation, I make the power
Manipulations, so my offspring'll be straight for generations
Got connections in the nation
To incarceration, to general population
More lyrics than Jason, look me in the face when you speak to me
You got a tattoo? Bitch youse a freak to me
Seeking the, good sess material
Asking when's my next video
Bitch get a job and get your ass in somebody's university
Enroll your youngun in a nursery
And cleam him up, comb his hair, cover yourself
You want a man to love you you ain't loving yourself
I'm discovering wealth watches wisdom in ways
To make it in the last days, now bring it on
Chorus
Verse Two: Sean Lett
I feel blessed I survived two decades in this world
Then Ninety slid in naked now I got a baby girl
Ain't this a bitch, myself still a child
I want to hang on eighty-seven corners act wild on Stoney Isle
Better school her, so presence is your seed in society
Parks of envy jealous niggas crack fiends yes indeed
I won't misleed and you can best believe
I'm just a blink away shorty anytime that you need
See I know right now, you're just too young to understand
Asking questions, why pops and moms don't be holding hands
Don't you worry about it yet, in due time we'll explain
Why having you, created just an everlasting shame
Bringing joy witcha smiles, tripping when you first walked
Knowing somebody's child is gettin outlined in chalk
Just relieved it ain't you, I got much love for you boo
Cause it ain't nuthin that these skanless niggas in these streets won't do
Stop me if I'm lying, see my race is steady dying
Short methods to making cream, bullets sprays and shatters dreams
See basically, Chi-town's game-related and designed
Niggas store up theirs and down opposite signs
Chorus
Outro: Sean Lett, Common
It's like that y'all (yeah yeah)
Common Sense and dirty mizer on the set y'all
Sean Lett
We gonna get down like that
My man Eddie C on the board
We coming through y'all for eighty-seventh street
Seventy-first and everybody in South show
We coming through for niggas on the West side
Down in the ickies, all up and down state
We gonna keep it straight like that
We straight out for gold
You call it Chi-town it's still our town
Holding it down like this with that eighty-seven sound
We talking about rocking niggas state to state nationwide
On the real it's like that
Straight up South side is where we loaf
Shit be real around these parts, I'm serious

You know what? We out though",https://genius.com/Common-lately-ive-been-thinking-lyrics
Dooinit,Like Water for Chocolate,2000.0,"Mo'fucker move back, I pursue rap at the pace of a New Jack
This miscellaneous numbers and shoes stack
Bruise rap I deliver for the hungry and underprivileged
Something different from these hollering and grunting niggas
This is business strictly, step to my business is risky
'Specially when you as bitch as Missy
Back to back LP's that sound the same, I surround the game
With a four-pounded brainstorm
To make niggas dance in the rain, scared to take a chance in the game
Used to breakdance, it's a shame
What money do to a nigga brain
If he lose his soul what did a nigga gain?

""Doin' it, doin' it, I am doin' it""
""C O double M O to the N"" (cut and scratched 4x)

My train of thought is that of a hustler, or a nigga with his shirt off
Trying to get his work off to customers
I rap with a chip on my shoulder, squeezing Coronas
See shirts that say ""We gotta get over""
That jiggy shit is over, the war is on
I only want to be a soldier, I'm holding on, to a culture
Focused like Gordon Parks when it's sorta dark
For niggas that's flooded with ice, my thought's the ark
Performing warming arts with some shit for the heart
Don't fuck with radio, ignoring the charts
I could give a FUCK what you made in a year, nigga, you wack
A soft nigga on a hard track, in this new rap
Generation I ""X"" cats like a Muslim
He fell off cause I pushed him
Let his Bently and his weak crew be his cushion
I catch him on the streets, in front of the bodyguards and rush him

""Doin' it, doin' it, I am doin' it""
""C O double M O to the N"" (cut and scratched 4x)

You wasn't saying you was a thug before Pac came
Ten years ago you had a high top trying to be like Kane
Then Snoop released and it became a G thang
Claim sets, your city ain't got gangs
Niggas ain't hate you, they ain't paying you no attention
In a circle of faggots, your name is mentioned
With six degrees, I separate MC's, from a business man that's good
From a nigga that was raised or just lived in the hood
From what a nigga says to what's understood
Keep my shit tight like them boys in ""The Wood""
Dick is always hard like the ""Boyz in the Hood""
Peace to Dug Inf, No I, Sean Lett, the whole Chi
At the crib some cats give me the cold eye
I'm a bitch slap the next one
Let him know the world is my section for taking
You got to use aggression

""Doin' it, doin' it, I am doin' it""

Strange Fruit,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze
Strange Fruit

Dance little brother, dont give up the fight
Hang on 'til tomorrow, the truth will come to light
Dance little sister, don't give up today
Hang on 'til tomorrow, tonight we celebrate, celebrate

Black bodies on the wall, color from years ago
It's spiritual the way that them tears they fell slow
Roots and bruises so deep, found it hard to sleep
Souls lost in the heat, pray to God to keep
Fast forward to my pop, he nod and geeked-off the Heron
Still he was dead to bear arms
Thats where I'm from, my story ain't that different from yours
A blood line, a hard time, prisons and wars
With struggle it came rain, when it rains it pours
We stayed between liquor stores, and ""praise the Lord""
Singing ""we shall overcome"" cause we came for more
We were dancing for it to rain no more
Though hurricanes and waves they came ashore
Takin' lives of the brave and poor
They'd ignore, us once again
But it was lessons in the wind
Of change that came from within
So...


Wonder if I make it to heaven, will I get a chance to party
And celebrate with the great black bodies
Im talking bout Marley, Nina, and Marcus Garvey
Similair to Africa the streets is our safari
From shanties in slums, is children with guns
AIDS and poverty killing our young
Gramps keep sayin a savior gon' come
For the meek and the humble favor gon' come
From the same trees we were hung, we can see the sun
In the darkest hour, our power begun
I write from the same place they were bleedin' from
I'm emceein they done until the streets is won
So far we've come, with so far to go
To do the impossible only God will know-how we do it
I speak it and I put it in the music
The struggle lives through it, its a movement so move it

Dance little brother, dont give up the fight
Hang on 'til tomorrow, the truth will come to light
Dance little sister, don't give up the day
Hang on 'til tomorrow, tonight we celebrate
Celebrate...celebrate...celebrate...celebrate...celebrate
Oooooo you got to
Dance little brother,(oooh) dont give up the fight.(Dont give up the fight)
Hang on 'til tomorrow,(oooh) the truth will come to light.(will come to light
Dance little sister,(ooh) don't give up the day.(dont give up today)

I try to keep it out my head, it's not that simple to me

Why don't I take the time and then adore my baby doll?
Why don't I take the time to get you anything you want?

Love never gave a limit, wait a minute, stay up in it
Every day we give it, play to win it, way we live it
My heart, you came to visit
Stay extended
The lap of love we lay up in it
Days is vivid same incentive
The way we hit it's like Will and Jada did it
A house is not a home unless we staying in it
Stay committed
I used to get around now I'm staying centered
Angels ascended, grounded, stay cemented
The mentality, we all casualties
I can't do this casually actually you challenge me
To balance me
Paid dues and salaries
Been through truths and fallacies
The unfamiliarity made me loose calories
In a house with wine playing Amy's ""Valerie""
Then I realized the past ain't my reality
On love's balcony, you standing out for me
This is alchemy, unashamed and undoubtedly
Now I see

What you doing to my heart is unfamiliar
I try to keep it out my head, it's not that simple to me
And what you doing to my heart is unfamiliar

This love's alive, it clicks the way that T.D. Jakes described it
Vivrant thing the way that Tip from Tribe would sing
So many things that you provide the king
You too fly, never should you hide your wings
The awakening, let's keep breaking things
Breaking rules, breaking laws, breaking through
Breaking walls, sacred thoughts
Are the oceans that we make it cross
The truth is a naked cloth
No need to take it off, the wait is off
Love we make and do is unbreakable, relatable
State in you relating to the faith in you
Awaken to what faith can do
Fate is inescapable, super friends, we capable
To take it to a greater view they say is unattainable
I paint for you a picture I'm forever in it with ya
Love it when we hang, in my life, you're a fixture
A mixture of love, laughter, scripture
The right elixir, my spirit I pour to enrich ya
I'm with ya

Home,Black America Again,2016.0,"A man whose genius and freedoms and—
Ability to communicate and—
To talk, and to touch chords—
A man who has the ability and the audacity
And the unmitigated gall God to stand up, to stand up

I heard the sound of the trumpets, the voice on the throne
Seen the twenty-four elders and I knew I was home
I was told to write a song for the people
Take the original Hebrews on an Exodus of Black Excellence
Tell them to invest in us and make testaments about each other
On how we sisters and brothers
Cover the land and corners with poems and stone
Go hard with it, let 'em know you God with it
Even though I authored it, let no one margin it
And make it all about paper or first week's sales
Though this is from Heaven give 'em verses from Hell
Those that fell off the path, bring 'em back to the math
Your staff will be your microphone
Your name is Common, you was born to fight the norm
Take house niggas outta darkness 'til they lights is on
I'ma put a hyphen on your name: rapper-actor-activist
You the one that can reach into the black abyss
Stars that's asterisks, show 'em what a classic is
Freedom riders need passengers
In your lyrics use scriptures and passages
To make them rise like Lazarus and resurrect it again
They'll put disrespect on your name and respect it again
Every section you in, bless 'em and keep bussin'
If they don't like it, shake the dust and say ""fuck em""
Until you get home, I'm the one you trust in

I'm happy to be in any place
Where God's name is remembered

Soon I will be gone with the trouble of this world
Trouble of this world, trouble of this world
Soon I will be gone with the trouble of this world
Going home to live, going home to live
Going home to live with God

Go into the wilderness like Musa on a pilgrimage
Streets are villages, speak with diligence and authority
The fake are the Pharisees and Sadducees
Give them that Garvey free from the Black Odyssey
Yo pardon me, you the God bodily
Functioning on earth as a part of me
, that's why I gave you artistry
Go into the hoods with the shooters and the strippers
Forget the New World Order, New Jerusalem is with us
Tell sisters they earths and goddesses
If they got bottom, don't get caught in a bottomless
Pit, there's a lot of us fit for the kingdom is near
You can tell by the wars and how the seasons appear
You'll appear in the circles in Hollywood
, 
I birth you
In Chicago, you know how to parlay good
You'll get Oscars, Emmys, and Grammys, give those to your family
Don't get caught up in the vanity or the world's insanity

Soon I will be gone with the trouble of this world
Trouble of this world, trouble of this world
Soon I will be gone with the trouble of this world
Going home to live, going home to live
Going home to live with God

7 Deadly Sins,Nobody’s Smiling,2014.0,"Gluttony, baby
To me, it's what I see
Gluttony, baby
Is us, it's hard to see
It's knocking
Gluttony, baby
To me, it's what I see
Man, they gon', they gon'
Man they gon' knock this
And ride out to this

It sit deep in my chest, so let me express
Grew up on 868, oh, y’all don’t need the address
It was ‘round CVS, we were so devious
The city never sleeps, it be needing some rest
The streets was a mess, and they still are
Feel our pain, the bigger picture, we was all framed
But the game is the game, so let it begin
In these streets, these are the seven deadly sins
Now, the first is pride, though some call it vanity
A hustler's insanity can break up the family
Pride can have a man stuck in his ways, not subject to change
Knowing that he'll end up in a grave
It's the arrogance, they say, in us Americans
Messes up marriages, many sins, pride is parenting
Like the second is something we all have
Or felt, than Cain or Khan, it's called wrath
I seen a boss take it out on his staff
Seen a crip take it out on a blood, causing a bath
Never seen a man making money while he mad
So hustle plus wrath? Y'all do the math
Now the third, you probably heard from MOP
They say use them rocks to make 'em envy
Envy, the cousin of jealousy, on the streets it's a felony
When niggas fucking with you but commit infidelity
They hate it, to see you celebrated
Counting my paper, nigga, you could have made it
Let me stay with that thought, takes us to the fourth
Where niggas is lazy, that's what we call sloth
Want you to break em off, getting money it costs
For you to be a boss, ain't no taking off
Now the myth about the fifth: it only happens when we eat
It’s gluttony, this is how it happens on the street
It’s a dude that’s getting paid in full, cars and jewels
So his plate is full, but the way this nigga move
He is never full and he gon' want your food
Don't overdo it, that's an underrated rule
The sixth is a fix that's in all of us
When I get drunk and want to bust, this is what we call lust
When the drawers go down, the guards go down
Cause a pussy is somebody getting robbed right now
Okay, the seventh is a seed that many believe
Is the cause of 'em all, this is what we call greed
Knew some cousins that was hustlin', one of em ended up bustin' the other
Greed is a mother, it’s greedy motherfuckers like Madoff
Cops getting paid off, greedy companies got my people getting laid off
Before I sign off, in the sins we livin'
The good thing is we can be forgiven

Feel the ghost of Notorious, tell me who the naughtiest
She get live like an audience
I do what I do, no need to state the obvious
Poli' with girls with bodies, uh
Poli' in hotel lobbies
Light a J, it's just me and Marley, look at the poster
Do what I supposed to for the culture
Early b-boy, down with d-boys, build and destroy
My pride and joy is my daughter named Omoye
'Ye, that's my nigga from back in the day
All that whoop-de-wah-whoop, man fuck what they say

Popular girls always wanna pop in my world
I pop out in the boroughs and go to L.A. to get hay
In the middle of the barn with a princess I laid
Yo, this type of shit happens every um, once in a while
You know I won't front with the style
Bring life to the party like a woman and child
From the land of the humble and proud, summers is wild
Ah! Made the unmade-able
Ah! Go to parties I'm paid to go
Me and cuzzo talked the hustle
About doing good business like Rick and Russell
You I know I guzzle red wine till it's bed time
On my paper like headlines, she want the head shine e'ry time
My time, the streets is watching like a Rollie
Do it for the hometown and the homies, uh

Hustle Harder,Nobody’s Smiling,2014.0,"Black and blue outside her soul
Carries a heart of gold
Her misconception 'bout what love is, she passes on
The child she brings in to the world don't know
Right from wrong
Her soul is sore, she deserves more

Red lipstick bo', French press col'
You know she queen bee by the way she wear her gold
Honey gettin' money the ass is stupid
She far from a dummy funny I thought she came from money how she makin' money
At the club going hard like liquor
Shots of Ciroc she can out drink a nigga
Niggas dig her think they can take her to the crib and break her mover her shake her you can't fake her
She knows time is paper
Glaciers on her neck-uh
Pleasures on her finger
Gucci purse carry notes like a singer uh uh
Go to the steam room and she carry a steamer
Beamer benz she got friends
She got friends in high ends
She know trend she know when
She go in like an investor
Yes sir, never getting gassed like a Tesla
Ain't about all that extra
Destiny brought her to where niggas bought her, a lot of shit
She ain't caught up bitches taught her to hustle
Hustle harder than a nigga

(Uh huh)
She hustle harder than a nigga (True)
She hustle harder than a nigga (Uh huh)
She hustle harder than a nigga (She get get get)
She hustle harder than a nigga (She get get get)
She hustle harder than a nigga (She get get get)
She hustle harder than a nigga (She get get get)

She bad, uh uh, she bad
Don't complain about it but she let you know when she on that rag
Swag like Angelina or more like Angela Bassett
Many aspects emphasis sophisticated and ratchet
She fasted for a week that's stronger than most
If she had kids she could mother father them both
Prominent host throw a party and she know everybody
Devil in a tight dress something that is golly
She know what niggas want she know how to make 'em hunt
Hotel suite at the Trump
The way she walk in them pumps
Talkin' 'bout takin' over the world while holding a blunt
She hold her man down when her man get locked up
Prada keep movin' she movin' and shake it like Parkinson's
Used to seel hot purses and network marketing
Eye shadow darker than them dudes she like
An actress her life is so movie like
She hustle harder than a nigga

(Uh huh)
She hustle harder than a nigga (True)
She hustle harder than a nigga (Uh huh)
She hustle harder than a nigga (She get get get)
She hustle harder than a nigga (She get get get)
She hustle harder than a nigga (She get get get)

Uh, Dreezy
Look
I be livin' like I need a Lamborghini
I make it happen I would never need a genie
Went and got zucchini
Threw away that fettuccine
I been going to the gym I'm tryna get in that bikini
I'ma, smart chick but I never went to Harvard
I'm like a Nina got designer for my armor
Lookin' for a presidential nigga like Barbara
I'm harder, at these niggas heads like a Barber
This is for my ladies whose single but got a baby
Who Probably driving a Honda but saving for that Mercedes
This is for my pretty women that know that they independent
You say that her shit is rented she probably get offended, man
The new kid like a transfer
I'm known to set trends let them copy like the answers
I could be a lady in the streets but in the booth I pull triggers
Shots fired I got harder than a, nigga

Afternoon, breezy afternoon too, the winds out west at fourteenth gusting at 22 O'Hare

A Film Called (Pimp),Like Water for Chocolate,2000.0,"Yeah, yeah, yeah
You know, they call me a pimp, and you know what that mean
I'm a Person In Making Profit
See, I pimp internationally
I'm nationally recognized, locally accepted
I pimp with the truth, that's the only method

Seen her on Madison where Vice Lords be travelin'
And Chevy windows be rattlin'
And badder than any other broads that I've seen in these parts
Her body language spoke like a smart remark, eyebrows arched
Thick lips, blond wig, nice tits, ass the size that I dig
Asked her the name, one way to approach her
See she had game, she needed me to coach her
Expose her to some paper, freedom and culture
The way a righteous pimp is supposed to

As he came closer in his eyes I seen fortune
I ain't having it like abortion
Walking with this stick holding his tip
Looked like a Black Panther that was trying to pimp
It was cold as shit, I'm waitin' on my ride
Act like I didn't see him I tried

Motion denied (pause)
I felt the vibe like Roy Ayers
She was used to seeing pimps in furs and gators
Told her I'm an innovator, a gentlemen of leisure
That's in tuned with nature, hold Common's hand
I'm a take you to a pimps promise land
Where no man can break ya, break ya, break ya

Pimps, ho's, hustlers, plans, dealers
Customers, and bodies stuck in it, Oh my god
Pimps, ho's, hustlers, plans, dealers
Customers, and bodies stuck in it, Oh my god

(Hey girl, come on over here, check it out)
Make your next move your best move, choose me

How I look working for a nigga in a kufi?
If I was on a track you couldn't produce me
With them shits on your wrist looking goofy

(Yeah, OK)
I pimp without a pause, for the cause, I'm a rebel
You been on the streets I'm trying to take you to another level
You used to the same game, cats saying the same thang
Nigga you gone ho underground or ho mainstream

Nigga, you must not know of me
I'm the mack here
Ought to have you ho for me (Common: Get real now)
Pimp yo' punk ass, have you write me poetry
I'm from a lane called cash, you too slow for me

You know why?
I'm thinking bigger than baguettes, furs, and slick cars
Or have you on the corner trickin' in strip bars
If you become mine the world would be ours
Respect the game, and universal laws

What, I oughta pimp slap your ass and make you fall against the wall
(Common: Try it)
Why you in the game if you ain't even trying to ball?
I know pimpin' ain't easy but damn, you barely surviving
We can't ride together 'cause you ain't driving
(Common: Oh, it's like that)

Pimps, ho's, hustlers, plans, dealers
Customers, and bodies stuck in it, Oh my god
Pimps, ho's, hustlers, plans, dealers
Customers, and bodies stuck in it, Oh my god

(This, this, this really how I look at it, check it)
You and I together is like Ashford and Simpson
Picture us elbow to elbow at the hustler's convention

Think I'm gon' risk my ass then give you the cash (Common: Yep)
That shit is the past, I got my own stable (Common: Where at?)
I oughta pierce your navel and put you on the track
Matter of fact I been looking for a ho that's abstract

Girl, you getting beside yourself
I'm trying to guide you
Help you see inside yourself
I pimp with vision, I'm a help you see the light
Have you covering your body and have you eating right

(Is that right?)
I'm pimp ho's, pimp pens, (Common: Say what?)
Pimp rhythms, pimp flows
Pimp men (Common: And pimp what?)
Pimp systems
Got stores called Big Pimpin' (Common: Where?)
Down South
In Texas I ran the best ho house

(So)
I pimp from Brazil to um, Tokyo
Have Japanese broads sayin Choushi wa dou
(MC Lyte: Yeah right)
Bring 'em back to the States to turn dates from Europe
Made the dirtiest of hoes seem purer

(HA ha ha ha ha ha ha ha)
(Common: Why you laughin'?)
I'm laughin' 'cause you funny
I make bitch niggas like you have my money
I get six hundred off yo' skinny ass weekly
You'll get all them righteous hoes in that dashiki

Yo, whatever happened to loyalty?
Don't you want to become royalty?
On the streets selling ass and oils for me
But you on this ho-asis and really I can't reach you
Fuck you then I'm about to be a preacher


Well there you have it y'all
The story of pimps and hoes, y'all know how it goes
It's been the oldest profession
The whole thing is like a lesson
Ain't no second guessin'
Pimps y'all, hustlers
All that good shit
Yeah, yeah, 2000 and forever
It'll be here

Rain,Black America Again,2016.0,"The wind against my face, tells me that I must go
Can't stay around too long before my tracks gonna catch me
When they do, I've got to be somewhere in LA
So I can look at the sun and get my thinking done
And if it's gonna rain tomorrow, let it rain

The last note I sang was in Beaver Falls, PA
At some old and shabby bar, I never knew the name
But I knew I could and work that  all on my dreams
They tell me find that place, find that place

And if it's gonna rain tomorrow, let it rain
Let it rain, let it rain
Let it rain, let it rain

Deep in my destination, trying to find my destination
With LA so far away and I'm soaking cold today
Constantly it's on my mind
I'm only halfway there, I'm not caring how much frustration
Oh, I've got to cross this nation

And if it's gonna rain tomorrow, let it rain
Let it rain, let it rain
Let it rain, let it rain

As the rain falls down from the heavens
Think of how far I came since '87
Took my hustle and made it a weapon
I was always told ""in the pain there's a blessing""
Mistakes that I made, they mirrored the lessons
Talking with God, I asked clearer questions
Dear Lord, is this what I'm destined for?
If so? Then what am I stressing for?
We tight, then why can't I let it go?
Everything gon' be alright, it's more than a metaphor
Let it rain cause it's ancestral
Cleanse my heart so they can see the best in you
Let it rain and come down visceral
For those no longer here in the physical
Let it rain cause it's like tears from you
Just like the rain, I'll do what I'm here to do
Let it rain, I know that it's purposeful
So that it can service you and return to you
Let it rain, let the rain surround me
And never drown me, I was lost when it found me
Now in a dream is where I'll be
Imperial reign came down to crown me
Now in a dream is where I'll be
Imperial reign came down to crown me
Imperial reign came down to crown me
Now in a dream, a dream is where I'll be

And if it's gonna rain tomorrow, let it rain
Let it rain, let it rain
Let it rain, let it rain
Let it rain, let it rain
Let it rain, let it rain",https://genius.com/Common-rain-lyrics

Wanna feel the vibe, wanna feel the vi-ibe!
Uhhh.. wanna, what? Yeah
Wanna, what? Uhh, yeah (come on)
Every-bod', c'mon, uhh
Yo, yo.. (all night long)

During divine hours, I use mind power to refine
Flower girls, and make 'em feel like black pearls
Get they minds off acryllic nails and the rap world
It's a lot you can find in the lost black girl
Ma-sons build in lodges, we be in garages
Discussin' who we boned and who God is
Pro-black like Craig Hodges with my dashikis in the cleaners
I kick it for the Chevy ridin' head to backstreet leaners

(let me get a piece Bee) niiiiiight..

Check it, check it
I was born underwater with three dollars and a cocktail
Tryna make the Garden of Eden, out of Auckdale and Rockwell
Locked in this Grid like a 2Pac tale
Wild hair and rock smells make the cops tail
My third eye is my rail, on this L of thought
With afrocentric stamps I'm mailin' thoughts to my Gods held in court
I dwell where rebellion's taught, and emotions seldom walk
I try to walk like an Egyptian, but Hieroglyphics fail to talk
I guess the hustlin is the unspoken Gospel
Love that I'm an apostle, feel the holy spirit of Chicago
E Bottom, here's the bottle
I think I, need a cup of a tea, because I'm novel
(come on bay-bayyy) Bust it

Iahhhhh jus' wanna rock you
Alllllll night looooong

A portrait of the Artist, formerly known as Sense
The brain-wash, with my vocal tones I rinses
Opportunity and the beat knocks
Women, give me rhythm like beatbox, but it's the year
Of completion, I want a Queen to complete Rash'
Who's flavored from stacks, to Reeboks
Send blessings to the family of Ice Mike
Shit like that, don't help me write right, but I got site/sight
Like a construction worker, when it's time to build
Get off like Sam Jack' and it's time to kill
In perserverence I'mma find a meal, and provoke

I walk downtown to tempos and never lose the beat
Some people got ignorance confused with bein' street
On the, street of desire my body and soul meet
Arguin over thick broads and meals with no meat
Had the cold feet for a second
Mega-niggas in my box throwin suggestions
Had me checkin' myself and double checkin', I popped the resurrection
In the mirror I only heard my reflection
Let me hold mics, while you hold dicks and CD collections
And at MusicLand and Coop's, we can make connections
I meditate with confidence, to not chomp on cents
Outspoken like 30's but yet I guard my lips
Writin niggas with stripes, I hold posture with
Poppin shit to fat broads, wearin os-trich
Givin em voicemail, tracks are like County
To them I voice-jail/gel, if you believe in Heaven
Why is the choice Hell? Why is this choice Hell?
Why is this choice Hell?

Time Travelin’ (A Tribute to Fela),Like Water for Chocolate,2000.0,"*Singing in Spanish*

What what, we do this time
Rock rock....
Yes, let this music travel through you
Talk about feelings, yeah yo

Yo wassup world?
Yo what's happening?
It's the C-double-O and I'm back again
Take this back and then, tell a friend
Spaces and places you been, time travelin *echoes*
Time travelin *echoes*

Yo, I was a piano player in my last lifetime
Now I write rhymes, sip white wine and let my light shine
Out the dark space, with the world on my mind like Scarface
Though my sex drive like a car chase
More than a uhh, it's the piece of mind I chase
Stakes are high, like my uncle is
We both got problems, he never confronted his
Under the bridge I wrote, some shit to stay afloat
And paint a picture, raw like the first coat
Send my old man a note to keep his phone on
My little cuz'll know cheap tricks are homegrown
Travel to a place sweeter than home, listenin to Nina Simone
Repeat this psalm, to the sky I'm keepin my palms
Facin the east, actions macin the beast
Embracin the streets, my guy caught a case cuz he beat
His lady down, it's two-thou
That ain't the way we lay it down
Souls get, found and lost at the roads they cross
Many paid dues, but few knew the costs
I ran through the Moss like Randy
Touching down with God, close friends, and family
Recognize the voice in the wilderness
Com Sense, '92 and I'm still in this

Time travelin, took my time in hand
My rhyme learn and plan
Jealousy, money and pride can burn a man
Some walk but never learn to stand
Still, afraid to expand what they feel
I'm dealin wit, wakes, marriages
ATM's, Ericsson's
Loud niggas that whisper carelessness
If we livin in Revelation
Why should the people of the sun have to run?
Come to Esau in a year, he'll have freedom
He ask why I hadn't been to see him
Really, I ain't have a good reason
He said, ""Rah, give back what you receivin""
In a race against time, I was caught
In the same game as you, but long live the sport
It's time travelin
It's the C-double-O and I'm back again
Take this back and then, tell a friend
Spaces and places you been
Time travelin *fades out* time travelin....

Yo wassup world?

I’m from Chicago, nobody’s smiling
Niggas wylin' on Stoney Island
Where the chief and the president come from
Pop out, pop pills, pop guns
On the deck when the opps come
Pop some, ops run
This ain’t a game nigga, ain’t no options
Nigga selling on the block like an auction
Dig into my pockets, see a profit
Where the money and the bitches is where the guys is
Godfathers in the lodges, at the spot holding money like a hostage
She went ostrich, from the projects with posture
I draw with the goddess like an artist
Getting paper with no margins, money gods
I do it for Hadiya and Trayvon Martin

Thinking of ways to get money
Drive down Lake Shore, scheming how to make more
If we ain’t eating together what is this cake for?
Ain’t nobody giving it, that’s what we take for
Niggas is broke, what I need to brake for
Glaciers of ice, lasers, and lice
Let the chains glow heavy, we paid for 'em twice
Made for the life, fall out like we out of bounds
Bars and guns, niggas got a lot of rounds
Tripping like you from out of town
The four pound will leave you on the ground without a sound
Ain’t no fathers 'round, sons of anarchy
Fighting attempts, trafficking, and grand larceny
At the party with the thots with the extra body
I’m in the inner city, it’s an out of body experience

Face on T-shirts with no hashtags
Just big ass trash bags tagged hash
Out here shit been trill
Fake ass gangster, quick to take a fag’s cash
Five versus six, Star Wars
No stickers, real bullet holes in car doors
Out of ten people that was shot, 7 ate 9’s
Two trey 8’s, and one 45
Tryna get to 23, numbers game
Then here come the fame
But they won’t say no names
Are these celebrities way too shy to be loyal to the town
I take my publishing check and spread my royalties around
Popes, bishops, disciples, stones
Counts, princes, lords, queens, and kings
They drilling on my land but ain’t no oil to be found
I might be part of the problem
I guess they just tryna prove they can back that shit up
Most of them can’t even moonwalk
My little cousin Bump J don’t know what he did when he introduced that goon talk
Is there a Scarface casting at the crib I don’t know about?
So many shortys have tried out for the role
That’s why he slide out and ride out with the pole
Now I see how my daddy felt the dark day he discovered that black power didn’t keep the lights on
Right on, the dearly departed still rapping to you
Looking for some yellow, white, red, black, brown flesh to write on
How long will they mourn me after I’m out of mind, out of sight, gone
A crash, a head-on collision affects both riders the most

They just actually ghosts",https://genius.com/Common-nobodys-smiling-lyrics
"Geto Heaven, Pt. 2",Like Water for Chocolate,2000.0,"God bless...

Know I love my baby; my baby loves me
Day gets so hectic, need a little company
It's quarter to eleven, time to get some Geto Heaven
Geto...

Searching for a love, throughout the ghetto
Young girls is thick, righteousness is narrow
I got my third eye on the sparrow
Want my peoples straight and to rock sweet apparel
The mother of my child, we're not together
Baby, it's your back, I got forever
As the weather, talks to us
Henrock and the Holy Spirit walks through us
The blunted eyes of the youth search for a guide
A thug is a lost man in disguise
The rise and fall
Of a nation, even when the buildings tumble, I still stand tall
I walk through the valley with a life preserver
Feeling at times, that I might just murder
Yo, but that ain't what I was sent for
I want folks to say his life it meant more
Than any car, any rock or any broad
He found Geto Heaven in himself and God

Geto Heaven
It's time to get some Geto Heaven
Geto Heaven
It's time to get some Geto Heaven
Geto...

Love, your happiness don't begin with a man
Strong woman, why should you depend on a man?
I understand you want a man that's resourceful
If he pay your bills, he feel like he bought you
Talking to a friend, about what love is
Her man didn't love her, 'cause he didn't love his
Hugged her from afar, said what I felt
You'll never find a man, till you find yourself
Time helps mistakes, you can learn from
'Cause one man fucked up, men you shouldn't turn from
You want a certain type of guy, gotta reach a certain point too
At that destination, a king will anoint you
Going through the storm, anybody seems warm
That relationship died, for you to be born, you worth more
Than anything you could cop at a store
For you to grow, he had to go, so what you stopping him for?
Not even I could ignore being alone is hard
Find heaven in yourself and God

You know I love my baby; my baby loves me
My day, it gets so hectic, need a little company, yeah

(Time to get some Geto Heaven)
Geto Heaven (Geto Heaven) it's time to get some Geto Heaven
Time to get some Geto Heaven, oh...

This music is so much bigger than me
As far as happy, joe, it's like a trigger to me
Dealing with crab rappers, and groupie broads
Record execs, at times it do be hard
But to choose words, and be heard across waters
Doing something you like to support daughters
Keeping your guys from collecting court orders
Conveying messages that the ancestors brought us
Thought of things to say to become the in thing for the day
Somehow, that didn't seem the way for me to make it
Music is a gift that is sacred
I opened it and used it hoping you could grow to it
Whether servant or a surgeon, you gon' go through it
Can't imagine going through it, without soul music
It's like Donnie Hath' helped me see Lonnie's path
On my behalf, let's take whole steps towards hotep
And show depth, as we make people nod
Find heaven in this music and God
Find heaven in this music and God
Find heaven in this music and God

Let them pussy niggas get in your mind like unh
Baby boy you could do it take your time do it....
If you get the chance
To be a man in a b-boy stance and advanced from the go
I'll trace outer space with a unh
The baby-sitter of styles - I've traveled miles with
Bitches and....I've traveled miles with.....
I've traveled miles with bitches and brew the ritual
Of the real unh
Your platinum but real unh's don't feel you

I've never been.. the type of nigga..
To take.. a broad to the courts
As a shorty I was always into sports
Now I talk to drums and walk in slums and thoughts that's ohhh
Instinct to hustle-divided by the struggle
Plus a couple of scuffle's and up to high shuffle
Even when it sound muffled..
I bust through.. narrow gates..
With king-sized thoughts that's sparrow shaped
Before I came up I had to elevate
Let a nigga move where he wanna move up to
You don't like how I'm livin... well fuck ohhh
I stuck to what I was on... a star is born on a cusp
Many angel's fell to the dust

No Fear,Nobody’s Smiling,2014.0,"Sitting on stairs, in street affairs
Jordan Airs, he got at least seven pairs
His voice rare, talk with a mumble
Chicago Bear hat, quarterback the huddle
Call an audible of trouble came
His name Chris, black as his hustle name
Reaction to his chains, it's like a basketball game
Watch him winning, hope your team do the same
A menace, he O-Dog, Caine
Wish a nigga would go against his grain
Used to staying but moved up in the game
Take a nigga spot, take a nigga fame
The fortune of a caine, long live his reign
He do it for a son, he do it with a gun
Whatever he do, yo, he do it till it's done
A team full of hitters, so they hit and run
The priest don't even want none
Walk with the G's cause the G's never run
Something to be from the slum and be the one
This is where he at, this is where he from

Putting that truth in my baby girl's ear
Told her that dudes gon' want some ass
And whatever you do, do it with class
She wanna E, but to me, you gotta earn it
You can't circumvent life, you gotta earn it
It's the circle of life, that's why we're turning
Yo, I hit a choir and a sermon, our messiah is returning
With a tile around my neck, a style around respect
Know the smell of good pussy and the sound of a tec
They fire, drill, stop dropping roll
I popped out the cold hip-hop, that was gold
The way of the road is our ode to the legacy
C'mon dog, you know my pedigree
Finding Forever, Be, the sun never set on me
Many reign, but the game never weather me
If I'm in the building it mean I got equity
Wearin' articles of black like Ebony
Since I was a shorty I was thinking longevity
No fear, I say that with levity

Joy and Peace,Black America Again,2016.0,"For his goodness and for his wonderful works
Unto the children of men
If my people will lift my name tonight
I will come in! I will be exalted!
I will be glorified! I will be lifted up!
Welcome him in tonight
Can't you feel him? Yes, yes
There is liberty
Open your heart tonight
Welcome him in, put them hands together
Fellowship, joy and peace

All praise to the all-eye seeing supreme-being
Giver of joy and peace, love supreme freedom
See him in your son, see him in the daughters
The mountains, the waters, all divine order
The king unseen, one dream that I had, I was talking to my dad
He said, ""Things ain't as bad as they seem""
Is this a God dream the way 'Ye sing it?
The dream seemed to go on as the day lingered
The meaning of life, you can't frame or name it
True stars remain like the name of David
Niggas get foreign cars and think they made it
It ain't yours 'til you create it
In the image of the beneficent, merciful, universal, versatile
My verses go 'til Heaven and Earth become reversible
Christ particle, so anything is possible
Fuck big brother, father, mother, God is watching you

And I want the joy, joy
And I want to know the peace of mind
I'll make a way, a way to see
Through it all and all, living for joy and peace
Still in awe in the night when it hurts
And your bed feels like snow, there's a joy in the rain
In your heart, there's a way
Turn your light on, turn your light on
Turn your light on, turn your light on
Turn your light on, turn your light on
Turn your light on, turn your light on
Turn your light on, turn your light on",https://genius.com/Common-joy-and-peace-lyrics
Sum Shit I Wrote,Resurrection,1994.0,"Marks I erase like racism, I'm as large as a bigot
Brew is my escapism, when I'm bubbly I just kick it
What I need from you is understanding that I'm standing
On my own two, down with my own crew
Told cancer, I'm bad to the bone too, I'm prone to snap off
When I'm off that Cognac I can't hold back like a masseuse
I get loose like a screw turned from left right to tight
Man, when it's time for some action I get red, tonight's da night
An eye for an eye, a life for what's right
Dissect it I'm on hi-tech shit computers want to bite
Your style is Pascal, mine is Basic and just instinct
I'm went to F.A.M. and ran scams, me and Murray got up on big links
And if knowledge is the key, goddammit uh I'm the locksmith
Studied the missionary waitin on my life, the mic I rush like bostage
I switch styles like a channel with controls that is remote
Engage in a page, and with words I elope
Walking down the aisles with styles I freak the vow(el)s
That tie knots when I rocks like a Z-28
At any rate, brothers gain interest cause I loaned them microphones
They couldn't house the shit so they had to rent to own
It's like that, coming from the Go rapper
I wanna bone Jada Pinkett and that ho Patra
So keep on, and you don't, now come on
Ah keep on, and you don't
When I'm alone in my room sometimes I stare at the wall
And in the back of my mind I hear a wack-ass rhyme
And I catch Alz-rhymers, then forget it, I get charged
Like a nigga in position with a stolen card of credit
Fuck flipping the script, the rap scene I'm trying to edit
My mellows call me ""Never"", they be like ""Never's going to get it""
Never's too much, I'm much too, I do justice to poetics
That's why cats be like ""Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you!""
Other studs come through to see what I am up to
They be on the dick of crew giving us weed and buying us brew
Like Kareem I got the hook up, brothers look out cause they look up
Rest in peace to Harold, I'm washing tons of rappers like Booker
T.
 told me ""You gotta get out of the crib, get into the world""
How you going to come off with the style that's sterile?
It's like that, keep on, ha ha
It's like that, keep on
My foundation is a black block of niggas that rock they hat cocked
I'm real like a fight with my rap, rappers I slapbox
Back I got my rap cocked get your Glock out the black face
Got tall flavor with fat taste, the rap race is a rat race
Just cause you got Adidas with the fat laces and the fro don't make you
Hip-hop
You sorry excuse for funk rap
Why is there so many cranks trying to rhyme, yo funk that
The real shit's starting to come back
The Go is where I'm from and where I'm at, jack
I started eating cat when I was 10
Before then I was getting big dog like Glenn Robinson
I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind
But comes a time when you gotta come off of that booty
The facts of life I didn't learn from watching Tootie
But living in the big city but I still like Tootie cause she got big titties
My style is steep, I rip rhymes on the incline
Splat guts bust fat nuts and lay up like a crip line
I'm slamming, jamming on the one
I'm a bad man, you're just a good son, come on",https://genius.com/Common-sum-shit-i-wrote-lyrics

Wear the prophets on the shirt, yeah, yeah that's the creed
I can give a fuck if it's real or a weave

Jordan 3s on the feet as we breeze down Lake Shore

Y'all fucking with this like porn
Put your fists up, 'cause you know I ride on

State of the mind, state of the city
I contemplate and rewind
State of the art, state of the mind
State of the city
I contemplate and rewind

I put the line down when I put the rhyme down
Lost on my own Stoney Island that I'm found
I ride around town like this is my town
Rapping to myself, trying to see how I sound
Kinda arrogant cause I’m from Chi Town
East bound & down, that’s how we get down
At the bar taking shots like they live rounds
My lifestyle is it’s good to be alive now
Lot that surround me, places all cloudy
Came in the Audi, pied piper rowdy
You in the 'Raq where it's war like Saudi
Youngins carry the iron man, like Robert Downey
Pound the ground we own the concrete jungle
Surround me loudly, wildly is how we came up
Think about the come up
That’s why I’m always on edge when the fans seem to run up
Hair all done up, we can spend the summer together
But when the weather change, lady friend
You may be forever stranger lines seem to blur
Yea I like you but I still love her, uh uh uh
I come from the under, wonder why they slumbered on a nigga
Now I see the bigger picture, pour a little liquor
The rich get richer, my dick get bigger
Cause I’mma go hard, g-go g-go hard
The more I know self, the more I know God
Coppin’ land from my bro Monar
Good to do business with the bro-gods, let the dollar circulate
Lower the murder rate but still kill this shit
In touch with the crib that’s why you feel this shit
The willingness to grow, the willingness to blow
The willingness to know that I don’t know shit

But I still wanna know
What the fuck you on girl

Enrichened souls, visions, goals, mission grows as I do
It was written like a haiku when I was seventeen
I used the syllables, y'all, to forever dream
Now I’m a Champagne King like Evelyn
Young hearts run free and forever sing
Yea

Tell me what the fuck you on
Cause your heart is sayin’ ohh, ohh, ohh – run

It was red, I guess it had to be the bloodshed
Love shed, ‘nough said

But I still wanna know
What the fuck you’re on
Cause your heart is sayin’ ohh, ohh, ohh – run
And I’m down to jump the gun with you
Tell me what the fuck you want
Cause your heart is sayin’ ohh, ohh, ohh – run
And I’m down to jump the gun with you

What the fuck I’m s’posed to do, you not around
I’m not talkin' 'bout when you're high I mean on the ground
Always hold you down in and outta town
Maybe I’m a clown got me crying out in front the crowd
On the inside but it feel like a fuckin’ cloud
Out my fuckin’ mind, I’ma fuckin’ drown
Girl but I’m not gonna fuck around
I’ma fuckin’ marry you and learn to swim
Let me carry you I need to hit the gym
Young hard jab but the difference is
Got young love but I’m not young
Faith in love but I’m not dumb
I don’t need to give a fuck about the outcome

God Is Love,Let Love,2019.0,"The unconditional, critical mission, listen to
The indivisible, mystical, it was meant for you
And meant for me, infinitely
Even been to prisons to visit you
Ask, ""What would Christians do?""
Well some are harassing Native Americans
If God is love, why is hate in the air again?
Search for Samaritans in the hood, misunderstood
A savior comes, will he only come for the good?
The lost tribe of Shabazz and the second class
God, I see you in the streets where the checks is cashed
Hear you in the heartbeat, hopin' that love'll last
I know you in the words, ""Where the first is last""
They try to use math to quantify you
In 2005, you saved lives by the Bayou
I know you in the mouth of the spouse singing, ""I do""
The most vital is how I describe you

Even when the hard times come
I'll be standing in your love
Grateful, grateful for this life
You turned on the light (Hey, hey)
Even when the hard times come
I'll be standing in your love
Grateful, grateful for this life
You turned on the light

We were Buffalo Soldiers, dreadlocked Rastas
Praying to Jehovah, Rafa, in the back of cop cars
Even then we knew that love was not far
It's in the passion of the teachers and the rockstars
The muslim sisters singing ""allāhu akbar""
It's coming from where Maya and Pop are
It's in the grandchild's stare up at Papa
""Love is love"" became the mantra
The montage for creation, we need it in relation
When two ships pass, one love is the flotation
It's what God used to put the planet in rotation
It's what the culture used to build a hip hop nation
From the basement to the attic, where cookie show for magic
It's what we told the world when we said our lives matter
Turn the student to a master, hustler to a pastor
That's why I'm a rapper, it's all that I'm after

Even when the hard times come
Yeah I know that
I'll be standing in your love (Yeah)
Oh, that's why I am
Grateful, (So) grateful for this life
You turned on the light (Hey, hey)
God your love has taught me that
Even when the hard times come
Oh, I know that I'll
I'll be standing in your love (Hey, and I am)
Grateful, grateful for this life (Grateful)
You turned on the light
You turned on the light, yes you did

When it's hard (Yeah)
I know you're right there
Tell me where would I be?
Placed it all
Without your love
At your feet
Where would I be?
I don't know
Without your light
What tomorrow brings
Tell me where would I be?
Without your grace
What I know is
I am so grateful, I am so grateful
Oh oh, oh I know (Oh-oh)

Rap life's like a dream that seems for real
A nigga wake up, superstar, with no acres
After travellin the world to see paper's just paper
Streets take ya back and forth like a shaker

Braggin how they don't eat meat and abstract

With a rhyme scheme to escape frauds

Like Kunta Kinte, I'm kin to the Lynn crew
My great, great, grandpap done been through
So much it's in my hemoglobin to be a ill nigga
So I figure like a father... that I'mma Turn This Mutha Out
But Common you ain't hittin in New York
I don't know what you thought hops, but chief I got tall props
Some cats think I'm six feet I'm so deep
Some stunts be thinkin I'm six-fo', my shit be hittin like switches
Bitches, ask, why my, britches, sag
I ask the bitches, ""Why your titties saggin?""
Put your nipple to the bottle I bust rhymes like breastses
I can get down, d-d-d-down like pessimist
""Ring the Alarm"", I got Charm like a neck-a-lace
Tell the truth, tell the truth, y'all had to move your neck to this
Didn't you, didn't you... and it, and it, and it
And it don't stop, bust it

Show Me That You Love,Let Love,2019.0,"Embedded in emotion, I'm open, hopin' whoever's
Calling's all in for the low-key, it was O-M-O-Y-E
I read my daughter's name slowly, I'm asleep, sleepin'
With the TV on, two in the morn', ""Who the hell is this?""
On some Biggie Warn', something's wrong, what's going on?
You should be under covers, warm, is there a thunderstorm?
Someone done you wrong? Words stumbled on, she mumbled on
Something's on, oh shit, she lit, a habit she got, legit
We talked a bit, truthfully I was tired
Youthfully, she was high with her friends, I said bye quick
The phone collided with my sleep again, three minutes later
But there's another layer, she said I didn't care
She said I wasn't there when she was younger
Summer tour buses wasn't enough to show what love is
She said I did things that a dad doesn't, and that she had questions
If I'm a good father, why all the bad judgement?
I'm looking past judgement, about to ask somethin'
But she was bag bustin', inside I'm mad, cussin'
Inside I'm sad, dustin' off my pride
I thought that I did protect and provide, and I'm a father that's live
What about them rides with you in the backseat?
You tellin' me if it's a wack beat, I came to a few track meets
Weekend movies, I got you tickets to Lil' Uzi
Truly I try, she said
""It's the things that you didn't do, not what you did""
It hurt her spirit when she saw me with another woman's kid
Peeled back and thought, to love her, I gotta listen
Now love and action is the new vision, she said
""Dad, let your actions be your loudest speaker""
And now my daughter is now my teacher, with love

Show me that you're there
Show me that you care
I've been looking for you
But you don't wanna share
I've been looking for you
Even over there
Will you stay around this time
Or should I be prepared?
Show me that you're there
Show me how you care
You like to come around here
(You know actions speak louder than words, right?)
Show me that you love me
Show me that you care
This space is feeling empty
But you don't see me there
You won't feel the pain
And you won't take the blame
How you come around here
And you just stay the same
Show me that you love
Show me that you care
When is the time for
You to pull a chair?
And tell me who you are
And tell me you'll be there
And show up when it's hard
And show me you care
Show me, show me
Show me, show me, show me
Show me
Show me, show me, show me

Heaven Somewhere,Electric Circus,2002.0,"Phone rang
Screen said caller ID blocked
But for some reason, I decided to answer it
On the other end, was a French accent
He told me we needed to rap quick
Cause he had did some bad shit
And would be gone for years
But spending these last two days with his momma and his kid
When he spoke, I wasn't trying to hear it
Cause I knew he was a real good person
And this didn't seem like it was in his spirit
He couldn't believe as much as I couldn't, what he had done
He said now it's time for him to turn himself in
For no longer could he run, from life, from God
I started thinkin, ""Why is doin' right is so hard?""
I thought back to when we was in London
Discussin' the New Testament, and how our lives related to it
And how we could make the best of it
My voice became desperate, so I asked him, ""Why you gotta go?""
He said, ""You know, turn to Matthew 24""
He said, ""No one knows the hour, nor do they know the day
But the kingdom is near; don't let anything lead you astray
As long as God is with me, everything will be okay""
So right about then, we decided to pray

Just lying back, making the smoke disperse away
Deep into clouds (deep into clouds)
It's making things appear to me so clearly
Deep in the clouds (deep in the clouds)
Just lying back, making the smoke disperse away
Deep in the clouds (deep in the clouds)
It's making things appear to me so clearly
Deep into clouds (yeah)

Your time, is a terrible thing to waste!
For there's, not one of these possessions
That you can bring to space (yeah, it don't matter)
It's a challenge
But the chance of seeing it, is quite a dream to chase (yes it is)
I hope, I remind God of him
When he sees my face (yeah he will)
He gon' see it!

Higher (keeps on)
This feeling just keeps on, hehe, lifting me higher (ever)
And it's ever flowing, it's ever flowing (keeps on)

But I keeps on going
I keep on going (he keeps on going)
I keep on going on, ohh

All mighty love, watching over me
A smile, brilliant
All over, constantly
Warm, comforting (comforting)

No fear of destruction, oh oh oh oh

His name is Christ, yeah (oh oh oh oh)
Heaven, Heaven is to me
Wisdom, understanding, knowledge
Oh (understanding)

Streets of gold and pearly gates
Halos wings all dressed in white
Hah (hah) hah (hah)
Angels sing and cymbols glare
No one's rich, no one's poor
Hah (hah) hah (hah)
People dreaming they live free
Making love while they in love
Hah (hah) hah (hah)
Wonderful dream
Wake me when you're home
Hah (hah) hah (hah)

Heaven? Heaven is being Pops
Heaven is spending a day with the grandchildren
Listening to they voices, and laughter and play
And then at the end of the day
We hug, we kiss, and slowly they walk away
And then suddenly, they turn and rush back to me
And hug me around the knees

A Bigger Picture Called Free,Black America Again,2016.0,"Living in a glass bubble, the fast hustle
The masked struggle that I'm in, the same one that you in
I knew inside when I was outside on the south side
Had to take it a step further the way that Ralph tried
Oh that's my stepfather
He stressed harder to make that bed and lock them doors
For the perfect picture, I forgot to pose
Used to rock Jabos and go out with bros
Tryna get lots of hoes till I got exposed
To a bigger picture called free, in the picture, it was me
Al-Hajj Malik Shabazz, Muhammad, and Noble Drew Ali
A side of Erykah Badu and Andre 3000
Telling me what I can't be
But you can't paint me
Black is the color of my true love spirit and I do love lyrics
And I used to love Harold's Chicken and I dance pretty good
And I feel at home in the hood and I get lit in the club
Still I love

If you look in my eyes, you'll see love deep inside
When I look in the sky, I see freedom
If you look in my eyes, you'll see love deep inside
When I look in the sky, I see freedom

If you hear this rhyme, it's coming from division 9
The toughest in Cook County
They count me out cause I did a crime
They say it's violent time in human beings
But being they ain't seeing me as human
In this big business called prison, I'm the one that's consuming
Illuminati illuminate me, fume and hate me
Mutilate me from my family, society, and loved ones
I wasn't raised to love guns, well maybe toy ones
My pops, y'all built and destroyed him
With prescriptions of poverty, dope, and unemployment
When will we see enjoyment?
I smile when my little boy get to visit for about 30 minutes
But we ain't never spent Christmas together, tryna get it together
What I'ma do when I get out? I don't know what it is to live out
Just reminiscing of the big house, I'm the one justice chose to spit out
My life story is written in a prison sentence
Wonder if this cell got room for forgiveness?
Still I love

If you look in my eyes, you'll see love deep inside
When I look in the sky, I see freedom
If you look in my eyes, you'll see love deep inside
When I look in the sky, I see freedom

It's gonna be you and me
When you're feeling free make you feel alive
What you got inside make you go outside
The change in I, it's the realest high
It's the realest high

Reminding me of Sef, what?
Fat fat thick booty, what?
You say jack that big booty, yo
He say OOH OH
I heard the boy he said OOH OH
The party people he said OOH OH
Uhh uh uh uhh yo yo yo
Check it, check it

Driftin' on a memory
Brought forth from a fifth of Hennessy
As in times of '89 they envision me
Warm days and the cold beer chemistry
Eventually, broken up by responsibilities and such
Sometimes, this era mentally I reconstruct
High school I came out it
Cats with clout at graduation got they name shouted
Go to Great America, me and my lady rock the same outfit
My niggas be fuckin' girls that she hang out with
Round then Guy came out with, 'Piece of My Love'
Arguin' over if he said, ""Dumb bitch""
Everyday the same old with rainbow, watchin' the sun twist
Cool as a Mig Dry, that in the trunk shit
Afterparties in Wendy's parkin' lot
Unfamiliar faces got marked a lot
Showin' off for hoes in bricks and rows had us charged to box
That demo sorta stopped once A.C. got popped

This reminds meeee... mmm whooahhh yeahhh
This remiiiiiiinds me... heyyeahhahh, uh-huh

Check it
Before these minds got ahold to some drugs
And start thinkin' they thugs
We'd be at the 
Bismarck
, and the 
Racquetball club
Plugged with Gucci promotion, so we got in free
Against the wall me and my guys formed a colony, Ron'll be beatin'
Saved my day, dancin' on speakers
Flames snatched I was born this way
87th Street and Hyde Park was warrin'
Over gossip, Kenwood broads was pourin'
Suited in three-quarter Jordans, pro-models
And Starter coats out the back of Beauty Shop Sevalas
Buy the dope, put my name in they verse, 
EPMD I would quote
 Stolen leathers I'd sell, like a child of broke
Behind the beat, I took my first shot of Henny
It hit me in the chest like when them marks shot Benji
Shame on the girl that left her Fendi around crew
Either go through it or, take it, we was bound to
Travellin' like Vice Lords, down to the Taste
Not wantin' to bring my lady around crew 'cause they would snake
House parties was the lick, behind bars we'd come up
At 'em I did the Hooper dance with my thumbs up


There go the break
To get the break go, it go OOH OH
Yeah, it go OOH OH
You heard the people they go oh oh oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh
Yo, check it, check it

Nowadays, niggas is fake, like that party at McCormick Place
I don't draw with 'em, 'cause they was born to trace
At times, I contemplate movin' to a warmer place
Then the Lake and skyline give me a warm embrace
Remindin' me of the pointed parties 
Moe
 used to make
Six deep in the Hyundai bumpin' Twilight Tone tapes
Come home late, callin' broads, hang up on they mother
If it wasn't nowhere to scrap at, then we would fight each other
Get a room at the Dunes, havin' bakeouts
We'd eat at Giordano's and break out
Then, everybody thought that they could spend
High rollers had the MCM blazer blend
Girbauds and Guess jeans we was takin' and
Cranes and freight trains we was breakin' and
Tim'll be basin' Mike down at I.I.T
Rememberin' numbers depended on how high I'd be

Cats knock my tape like boots, I'm as fresh as fruits
You pussy MC, it's you I rebuke
Repent! You burn up, you got me bent
I'm current as an event, got on big hoes at Freaknik
Frequently you're telling me Whoopty Woo can rock it
So? He ain't put no scratch in my pocket
Yo herb, with my hand I cock it
And rock it like that brother in Colors, 'cause I want y'all to live
My crew is too live, we sneakin' to the rear
But I can't get us all in free (What?)
It's just another case of that 2-dollar emcee
I rock the same clothes 3 days straight
To you they wrinkled but to me they straight
Now I'm straight; are you straight?
I'm straight as long as I got beer
I thought about it, Jack, and now I'm outta here

I need me some new socks (uhh), I need me some new drawers
I draws attention, like a letter to a sergeant
There's a few good emcees, the wack I'm giving code red
Slim say I ain't got no body, but when they see me at the party
They be like, ""Go 'head, go 'head""
'Cause I got's the cuts like Bobbitt, rappers are dickheads
Shoppin' they demo, I do 'em like Big Red
My office hours are from 9 to 5
While you avoid the party I make it live
The fellas nod and the chicks dance
While I'm coolin' in my jumpers and my big pants
I'm as dope as PCP; MC's see me and they start having flashbacks
I don't flash scratch, I gotta watch my back
Nowadays blacks don't know how to act
Besides Larry Fishburne, Charles Dutton, and Wesley Snipes
Marks wanna test me because I test the mics
But I check 'em like sound, and like Goose, I'm down

And house more hoes than Spelman
Words I'm weldin' like James Johnson
My brains sponsorin' speech on the mic, I'm like a Jackson
Rappers I'm fondlin', they try to settle out of court
But I could never be bought
What type of rebel eats pork?
I'll take the cat and never get caught
U-AC together we fought
'Cause I can't see my mellows boxin' and me not boxin' wit' 'em
I don't care who started it, I'mma be a part of it
Regardless of the odds of how hard
It's been many times we was outnumbered and we still got with 'em
I got rhythm from some boogers and some foxes
But a 5 becomes a 10 when a brother's off some gin
I got juice, and this nigga scared
I'll F your head up, like the LA Four
When I flow like cash I go for broke like Melba Moore
Why should a male with a B.A. get more than me?
When Rashid got an MC degree
And a doctorate in rockin' shit, I go to Dock's to get
A fishwich with cheese
I don't mix with MCs, 'cause I just don't like them mother—

Representing Chi Town to the fullest, raps are bullets
See them rappers? They be duckin'
When Comm be buckin' in the kitchen, fuckin'
On the sink, got my momma a mink
Think Common is the link
Thought the game was extinct
Lady, them jeans is as slim as Shady
Brought them back from the 80's
Now, let's make some babies
Freestyle paid off so Lincoln paid me
Now we can push more whips than slavery
Alex Haley of this rap shit, my roots is deep
You heard the bitch in you, yeah I know what's beef
Let it cook and I pop like grease
You thirsty niggas can't shock my feast, ugh
I still love her, she be needin' the dick
When it comes to hip-hop, it's just me and my bitch


Baby, you're like, ""What the-- fuck? There is no other""
Valet crashed my Rolls so quickly I bought another
Sorry, Mr. Williams moved out the building
Spot to the top, 50 feet was the ceiling
(Slow down, son, you're killin' 'em) Well funded it was not gangsta
Came to shitty deals, reminiscing gives me chills
When Puff was with Biggie, Versace on every niggie
The backpacker copped the Porsche and drove through his city
Now, all the little bitties, from ugly to pretty
I was the magician, mesmerize 'em, made 'em listen
My dick is like a blow-pop baby
And it get stiffer than some Botox baby
But show out baby, and show me you gon' act right
And I'll be pedaling backwards like a track bike
She don't know the Casio cost a hundred
It's been two years since I done it, now all the rappers want it
What?


As I sit back, relax with Chicago on my back
Unzip the backpack, pull out a fifth of 'gnac
I probably go to jail but naw, that ain't me
I style crazy and net like Jay Z
The black Kojak ""I get money"" and want more stacks
The rap photographer, the way the flow snap

Yea yea, I'll philosophize on top of ya",https://genius.com/Common-announcement-lyrics

South Side of Chicago, Chicago everywhere, check it
It's like come on, y'all, get live, get down
Common Sense is in your town
I said come on, y'all, get live, get down
Common Sense is in your town

I stagger in the gatherin' possessed by a patter-in
That be scatterin'... Over the global
My vocals be travellin', unravellin' my abdomen
It's slime that's babblin', grammatics that are masculine
I grab them in, verbally badgerin' broads
I wish that Madelyne was back on Video LP
Raps I make up like blacks do excuses
I feel like Noah, hookin' my mellows up on deuces
If a broad ain't got a mind, a job or crib, she useless
Acoustic basslines embrace rhymes while I chase mines
They say signs of the end is near
I wonder can I walk a righteous path holdin' a beer
Got more verses than a Kramer, go off like a pager
Skills uglier than Craig Mack in your ear, I'm the flavor
My old bird said some of my songs sound like noise
Don't watch the Bulls as much (Why?) They got too many white boys
A million black men walkin' towards one direction
For sure, the cream of the planets... resurrection

A prophet, raised among Black Disciples and Vice Lords
Who don't give a fuck about mic cords, 
at night, swords
Get up, together black wrists get cuffed
I'm wishin' for a change but my man want his change in a cup
Yes Sir, I'm in the Mix-a-Lot
Bitches put 'em on the glass while I'm puttin' stickers on they ass
I rule everything around me like cash
On the rocks of reality, dreams get splashed
In jams, I mash like Alan Alda
Niggas nod, thangs say ""Hey"" as if I was Little Walter
87 strip walker, taught the code of the area
By stayin', within the barrier
Exposed to Stony stimuli, with that I identify
Brothers went through my rotate solidify the realness
Skull caps, Smurfs, Puffy jacket, Lugz boots on
Steppin' to me is like goin' to the County being a Neutron

Don't hook with skins my friends like, I spend nights up in dykes

Come from a tribe of bums, hooked on Negro and mums
Had to halt with the malt liquor, 'cause off the
Malt liquor I fought niggas, now my speech and thoughts quicker
Cruisin' South Side streets with no heat and no sticker

Been through the PM just to see the dawn
They say it never rains in Californ'
That done changed 'cause of global warming
Depends on what you use for a lens
I was told God used rain to cleanse
In you I got a friend, your kin is my kin
I prayed for a woman, so I say amen
A gift in my life that can't be boxed in
You don't complain when I watch SportsCenter Top 10
Over and over again, no more holding it in
Let's write a love story, we don't know where it end
I'm beginning to understand and understand women
Yeah, understand forgiving, understand commitment
Understand living in love with no division
Understand she gon' be like, ""Nigga, just listen""
Girl, in me, a King has risen
So close, the future don't seem as distant

So fancy free, 'cause I wanna be
To understand part of me
So fancy free, 'cause I wanna be

blow
Red carpet looks I tell you when they coals
Use no stylist, you know I joke childish
My Gambino is black not Italian
Let's watch ATL, drink wine, and order Postmates

You juicin'? Don't lose too much weight
Mind full of Gotti, Soulcycle for the body
Your hero's Angela Davis, mine's is Ali

Relationship journey is spiritual, lyrical
Written in the sky above, it's a higher love
If it get ashy, we can start applying love
We can work, we can laugh, we can cry in love
Let's get gray, then we can die in love
Tell the first responders, this is a fire love
Gratitude, to the Most High above

So fancy free, as I wanna be
To understand part of me
So fancy free, as I wanna be
To understand part of me

You my partner, da-na-na-na-na-na
You are part of, da-na-na-na-na-na
This is sparks of, no matter what they call it
This is God's love, our love
You get spicy, any time I act like a Pisces
That's the only time you really wanna fight me
Can't copy sex, still you can bite me
That could be the start of our black clan like Spike Lee
You help me with my lines, tell me when my raps are wack
When I'm sick you got remedies to battle back
Your jellyfish theory we could master that
I love you this lifetime and after that

So fancy free, as I wanna be
To understand part of me
So fancy free, as I wanna be
To understand part of me

Aquarius,Electric Circus,2002.0,"Yeah, yeah

Nigga deep in the rhythm, experience speaks
I'm keepin' the wisdom, the life hustlers seek
I seekin' it with 'em
I'm dope, the streets need me to hit 'em
With some of that (revolutionary rap) 
revolutionary blunted rap
My peoples want hits, I hit it from the back
Under the cherry moon, I hold notes and carry tunes
My guys pack heat, enough to bury June
On my feet, I'm getting married soon
Walking in the clouds like Mary Bethune
The fumes of a real nigga seep into your room
Or through fifthteens of the Jeep that you boom
Son so many cats, they call me high noon
Offerings to Oshun, hoping war is over soon
Guard your grill like George Foreman
Time to build, as far as building, I'm the doorman
Opening doors, my blood I expose on the floors
Tell them the game ain't only the score
Hold on to your life as I carry these styles
To have you tapping your head like Darius Miles
You ain't supposed to rhyme, better off with a clothing line
In this business of pimps, many hoes get signed
Opposed to shine so me holding the blinds
Mixing golden seal and wine, holding a nine
In the age of Aquarius

The water that arrives (do-ba-ba ba ba)
To purify the world (do-ba ba ba)
Flying through the night (do-ba-ba ba ba)
So watch out, here he comes (do do-ba-ba ba)
Aquarius (Aquarius, Aquarius)

Between churches and liquor stores, my mic leaks
With raps, all over your head like Tweet
Playing with yourself, thinking the game is just wealth
Hot for a minute, watch your name just melt
Same spot where it's joyous where the pain is felt
As you build and destroy, yo remain yourself
They say I'm slept on, now I'm bucking in dreams
And rhyme with the mind of a hustler scheme
Or the struggle of fiends
I flow over water that's as troubled as teens
For the love of the team, trying to double the dream
Be grateful like the church psalm my grandmother sings
I'm rubbing my rings across the domes of clones
Punchlines like Roy Jones with poems
While you and your dogs foam at the mouth
Thinking rap is the only way out
The black human genius will never play out
I take you way out, where you never been before
Been it since birth,
 sent to replenish the Earth
That truck that you roll is like a miniature hearse
I deaded your shit before you finished a verse
From niggas to gods 
from bitches to earths
From Nat to Truck Turner that lives in my verse
Realness is an act that you cannot rehearse
Holla back, but listen first
We in the age of Aquarius

The water that arrives (do-ba-ba ba ba)
To purify the world (do-ba ba ba)
Flying through the night (do-ba-ba ba ba)
So watch out, here he comes (do do-ba-ba ba)
Aquarius (Aquarius, Aquarius)

Hot for a minute, now you just a ""remember him""

Stick to sayin'
No gimmickin' and no mimickin'

Pelican brief these niggas on who I be
Before the paper and the fame niggas knew Rashid

Young who? Oh, he the openin' act

It's a festival in hip-hop, we do it non-stop
Pop your bottles
Chicago niggas do it in staccato
Choppin' notes for my homies, fuck a motto
And Ferragamo shoes givin' dudes the model
Think fast, drive slow, survival is the throttle
Your live show is hollow, should've kept it local
Rappin' over vocals
Soundin' soft as JoJo
With twelve monkeys on stage it's hard to see who's the gorilla
You was better as a drug dealer

Half of it is what you say and half is style

Struggle music mixed with weed to make the ghetto react
I know they wanna Resurrect but I ain’t pedalin' back
They gangster stories just as real as Kevin Federline rap

Kinda wish it was some real niggas there that just snapped
Meanwhile in the mean world, hoes cry freedom and fiends url
I’m standing supreme like the Dreamgirls
And I’m tellin you like Jennifer Hudson

And you don't stop, 
with the heidi heidi ho
Hi ho, or bye ho, if you're lookin for a sucker
(What are you?) I'm just another motherfucker
Pucker your lips, 
do flips like Mary Lou
Just because I fucked you doesn't mean that I'mma marry you
Bury you, I will do, after, I bill you
Kill you, ho, cause your shit smells like mildew
Pe-ew, think you need some soap and a rag
Or better yet Black, Flag, you scallywag
Tag, I didn't mean to diss dis... ho butt
But you need to stay such, do not touch
Much disrespect goes out to you
And your parents, too, for having you
Haven't you been introduced to a douche?
I guess you said fuck footloose, and got your pussy loose
No juice, you shoulda dried up, like a prune-a
Mister mechanic this place needs a tune up
For the pink cadillac cause it's block is off
And have more use, than a public park
For recreation, giving up the body is a hobby
I'm tellin Santa Claus you been naughty (sing it)
Ho ho ho, Merry Christmas
Aiyyo JuJu, I just had to diss dis

Heidi Heidi Ho, huh, the Heidi Ho

An undercover trick, a toe a tac a tic
Naked at, frick-a-frat, plus her puddy wat
C'mere k-k-k-k-k-k, yo c'mere you little puddy cat
What, your booty black is so indespicable
You squaw-pie, tack-haired, motherfuckin jiggaboo
You can suck a dick or two or three or four or mo' here
But first get curlin iron burns off your forehead
My nigga Coe said, that you're an around the way girl
You're fuckin everybody around the way, and been all around the world
And you still can't find yo' fate
But you had a couple of babies I mean a Bunch like Brady
The lady is a tramp snake ho yo and all of that

Forever Your Love,Let Love,2019.0,"When the day breaks, I display grace
Through infinite takes, and heartbreaks
The ground shakes, talks around race
Through birth quakes, I keep my crown straight
And bow face to you, it's salutations
I hold you high, you brought me in creation
You were patient with me dribblin' in the basement
And said, ""Where's your common sense, boo? Don't waste it""
The pain that you had, it was hard to place it
For my dad, I couldn't be a replacement
I yearn for plates with catfish and collard greens
You got me into school, off of Mama schemes
I know I can lean, on you for anything
Ain't have to want for nothing, you my everything
They say we don't get to choose our mothers
Somehow I know our souls chose each other

Saint something, please protect this family
Give cover, from the world's insanities
I know you got a lot on your plate
The stress is on a lot of your faith
And no matter what's coming
I will be there, I will be there

Jesus walked across my lawn
And told me you the mom I'm supposed to have
Nobody in my life is as close as that
If I'ma write you a song ain't no holdin' back
Now, I wasn't raised in no cul-de-sac
You said, ""Stay in school,"" 'cause you ain't know I rap
Teachin' me in moments I ain't know was class
That's why every girl I go home with be showin' class
When I show my ass, you gave me a whippin'
The paradigm shifted and parentin' is different
Black woman strength in search of vulnerability
You did everything you could and did it willingly
Instilled in me values of what a child do
To say you my Ma, I'm ever so proud to
You wrote me letters to get myself better
I still cherish when we pray together
That's a time I really feel the Lord
I thank you for the your declarations and your vision board
It hit a chord, when they rolled you into surgery
Mama, you the sky and earth to me

Saint something, please protect this family
Give cover, from the world's insanities
I know you got a lot on your plate
The stress is on a lot of your faith
And no matter what's coming
I will be there, I will be there

Out on Bond,Nobody’s Smiling,2014.0,"Fresh out the county, shoes with no laces
Plastic bag carryin', no two paces
IPhone, belt by Gucci
Bands with loose change and some car keys
To the Maserati, license plate read ""God Body""
Passenger side only ride hot bodies
When we was young as we wanted, show our bodies
Cadillac come from the Southside army
The army now, don't try to harm me now
It's my time, you can't alarm me now
I ball, bitches wanna palm me now
Vacation in palm tree style
In the morning where the dons be now
Drinkin' lattes, over breakfast I pray and end it with a Ashe
Cops say we lookin' for a nigga thats dressed nice
Seats be goin' way back like Just Ice
Black leather wearin' ""justice"" on the collar
Change is we only ain't trustin' the dollars
Try to get me, get wet like bed sheets
Probably with technique, and let the Tec speak
Like the led conference I rap off the head conscious
Freestyle, free trap niggas from bondage
Every word you heard is bond is
Double-0 87, on some Bond shit

Preposterous chains, top notch dames (I'm out on bond)
Preposterous chains, top notch dames (I'm out on bond)

Fresh out the county, shoes with no laces
Los Padrinos to juvenile placement
Known for C-notes, the feds confiscatin'
Back to that block with brains on the pavement
Paid restitution, O from the lootin' enter
Cause they did it, you was influenced
Your mind gone, life don't seem much bigger
Than your time zone, broke as the rich get richer
Blunt burnt lips and a worn out liver
That's everyday livin', guns everywhere chillin'
Got you feelin' like this money comin' sooner than later
'Til then I'll be runnin' from the judge and the bailiff
Crime commitin' cause these women love a man in Mercedes
I never save for when it's rainy, hope Jehovah can save me
While I'm out on bond tryin' to buy my time
'Til I hit the main line in that cell confined

But you just wanna rock me, ah-eh-eh, ah-eh-eh

But you just wanna rock me, oooh, check it
So get your rattle rattle thunder clatter boom boom boom
Because I gotta gotta get some, el-bow, room
So I can Bang-kok, better yet, knock Italy
But raindrops keep fallin on my couch, try to sit with me
Tamperin up my program, so I play another slow jam
It's not an ancient Chinese secret, you should know man
But you insist on stay and playin Genesis
I gotta put an end to this, balderdash, EEE haul ass
And don't come knockin my door, with the cockle-doodle-doo
I'm talkin the his and his and hers, Three's Company too

And don't come back now, hear?
Ahh to the break y'all (break y'all, yeah)
Ahh to the break y'all (break y'all, made it!)
To the break y'all (break y'all, NAHH!)
To the break y'all (break y'all break, BREAK!)

But ain't no haps (UH-UH) your dick isn't there
You're thinkin that, ""Oops, I made a mistake""
You say, ""Fuck Nell Carter, c'mon Jimmy, give me a break""
You made a mistake on the first take
Tryin to break a leg for take two
You shoulda ate your Wheaties
And Petey mighta made a breakthrough
You say to hope that things might bloom, so you assume position
Wishin he would listen, so you start to kissin
It's alive, and up goes, and up goes you're adrenaline
You aimed, you fired, THERE YOU GO, limp figures
So you take ? and then play the role of friend and talk
Try to tell her it's her fault, when Jack your Been wouldn't Stalk
Baby Bubba you's a goner, ahh, you's a goner
It's fucked up, when Your Dick Is Playin Tricks On Ya
So you pop fizz, what a relief, beef strokin'-off
My man, got your thing, in your hand, say, ""I I think I can!""
Damn this never happened before, yeah sure that's what they all say
Uh-oh you better get Maaco kid, cause old girl is salty
What was sweet to eat, has now dried up and rotted
It's a pile of pew, pick up your glove and say, ""Yo I got it!""
Hopin you won't drop you thought you had it made like ?Kay?
What more could go wrong - you got the right one baby!
Uh-huh, let you tell it, everybody and their momma knows

Walkin up and then down the strip
Lookin for some hip so I can skip
I spotted this honeydip, and her friend tried to sell me a script
That they were in a rush to catch the bus, but that was the OLD Gus
So I'm gettin a bus, as I thrill at the disgust
Since old girl was with this, I told her friend to kiss this
And listen physical fitness use your brain and mind your business
Dippin from a distance, in an instance I got the digits
And blew a kiss to her
(THAT OLD STANK HOEEEE) was mad I didn't speak to her
I hooked up with the one that looked NICE
Took her mind, like an ICE
'Til her friends gave her advice to think, twice
Before with me she slept, my rep was kinda ill
They told her to keep that booty still
I been through more hoes than the pill
Still I overcame cause I got game like a athlete (UHH)
In less than a half week, she was with it to do the nasty (BREAK)
The drawers dropped, the top off, and the boots was gettin knocked
I heard the door unlock, it was her pop he was a cop
So I stopped dropped and rolled, so I wouldn't inhale a shell
Broke like a fingernail, on my trail was the smell of tail
Bailed back around the flat, to wash off the smell of cat
Like a belt, everything was strapped
'til my homey asked, ""WASSUP WIT DAT?""
The dat was like dis G, I told him I got busy
This was the spy who dissed me cause he told it like a sissy
THAT WAS FOUL, I went to him lost in the mind now it's a dead end
The little red Corvette that locked the door and I can't get in
No more no more no more and now I know and now I know

The Ladder,Catch the Throne: The Mixtape,2014.0,"Littlefinger
: 
The realm, do you know what the realm is?
It's the thousand blades of Aegon's enemies
A story we agreed to tell each other over and over
'Til we forget that it's a lie
Varys: But what do we have left once we abandon the lie?
Chaos, a gaping pit waiting to swallow us all
Littlefinger: Chaos isn't a pit, chaos is a ladder

The rain came upon us,
 
we played the corners
Like Richard Sherman the best, I'm still learning
Scriptures turn to pages, pictures burn in rages
Outrageous, the big world, the stage is set
Threats coming from different ages
Death is ageless, life is dangerous
Change is the only thing guaranteed
I ain't afraid of the opps cause I know they bleed just like us
In the Seven Kingdoms ain't nobody righteous
A massacre at the Red Wedding, the lifeless
Laid on the ground, now who wears the crown?
A rope tied around by the power we bound
Sound the trumpets, I got soldiers by the hundreds
We all want it with our eyes on the summit
Chaos is a ladder and some fall from it
Some get tall from it, high like they all blunted
But this the year that we doing it with no fears
God in both ears saying ''be sincere''
Some are laughing, some of 'em be in tears
If this the end let the games begin

I think about it when I'm in my zone
This life is like a game of thrones
I sit and think when I'm in my zone
This life is like a game of thrones",https://genius.com/Common-the-ladder-lyrics

Men and women at work, cranes in the sky
We gon' keep building for our children's children
Doctors keep pilling, love is a drug then drugs can't heal 'em
But listen to Lauryn for the healing, peeling back layers
Pops used to hoop, I'm from a bloodline of players
Love and sunshine like Roy Ayers
Put your mind on the phone, I ain't coming back home
I felt the death of what it is to be alone
Everlasting love, money can't buy
Can't hide from the truth even when I pop the lock
Can't work it away, can't drink it away
Can't laugh it away, can't think it away
That pain come up on you like a thief in the day
Searching for the sun, I found my Issa Rae
Insecurity cold, imperial robes
I used to wear my heart open like Ethereal Rose
Now I'm carrying loads of baggage I don't claim
If she start tripping I'm hopping on the plane
Cranes in the sky, I know how the metal sound
I never settled in life so it's hard to settle down
Staying on my square trying not to get around
Hold my lady hostile, she could rebel down
Don't touch my hair, I'm baldheaded
Kept my love locked down like it was all dreaded
Wishing for wings again so I could spread it
But now it's in a plastic cup of false beverage

I tried to drink it away
I tried to put one in the air
I tried to dance it away
I tried to change it with my hair

I ran my credit card bill up
Thought a new dress would make it better
I tried to work it away
But that just made me even sadder

I tried to keep myself busy
I ran around in circles
Think I made myself dizzy
I slept it away, I sexed it away
I read it away
Away

Away, away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away, away

Well it's like cranes in the sky
Sometimes I don't wanna feel those metal clouds
Yeah, it's like cranes in the sky
Sometimes I don't wanna feel those metal clouds

I tried to run it away
Thought then my head be feeling clearer
I traveled 70 states
Thought moving round make me feel better

I tried to let go my lover
Thought if I was alone then maybe I could recover
To write it away or cry it away
Don't you cry baby
Away

Away, away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away, away

But it's like cranes in the sky
Sometimes I don't wanna feel those metal clouds
Yeah, it's like cranes in the sky
Sometimes I don't wanna feel those metal...

Away, away, away, away, away

Next Time (Just Wright),UnKnown,UnKnown,"I'm gonna blow your mind, hold you close
Squeeze you tight, the next time that I see you
I'm gonna tell you I love you, cross my heart
And I hope I die
The next time that I see you

I grew up, talking Chi-town slang
Never played soccer but loved to kick game
Loved chicks with thick frames
And big-lipped dames
Might see 'em on my arm
Cause I charm like thick chains
I was at the Knicks game, they were playing the Nets
Courtside so I could hear the shit they say to the refs
Thugs, this type of stuff you can't express in a text
See the section of girls who be dressing for checks
That's when she stepped in front of me
Light-skinned, long hair like a school days wannabe
A big 'ol (whoo) let's just say she was blessed
She had got it from her mama, God gave her the rest
We was being introduced by mutual friends
Like Kobe in the 4th, that's when the game begins
Game begins, games begins
I'm from the windy city, so I play to win

I'm gonna blow your mind, hold you close
Squeeze you tight, the next time that I see you
I'm gonna tell you I love you, cross my heart
And I hope I die
The next time that I see you

We conversated tough about life and stuff
Told her, tonight was just right for us
She was, flavor most and I can spice it up
Be my black Victoria Beckham once I wife it up
Asked when the next time we could speak
I might Khloe you, marry you in 3 weeks
Seen cheeks, she was like 'she don't remember my name'
That's when I realized ain't no gender in game
I thought, like ""Man! You don't know me?""
I'm the black guy in the flick with Angelina Jolie
Boldly, she told me 'Oh you got moves'
Her friends said 'No, really though, he's a good dude'
After couple months of dating and pairs of good shoes
Being snapped by the papps, we shared the good news
We were engaged, though many was confused
I'm from the windy city, so I will not lose...come on

I'm gonna blow your mind, hold you close
Squeeze you tight, the next time that I see you
I'm gonna tell you I love you, cross my heart
And I hope I die
The next time that I see you

She had a dope figure, y'all can go figure
Should of listened to 'Ye, cause she was a gold digger
I ain't a dumb nigga, she was able to pull it
Love happy, blindsided like Sandra Bullock
Or could it be, things go the way that they should
From the, unexpected, love could be understood
And in the real game, only love can win
I got to win, cause I fell in love with her friend

I'm gonna blow your mind, hold you close
Squeeze you tight, the next time that I see you
I'm gonna tell you I love you, cross my heart
And I hope I die
The next time that I see you",https://genius.com/Common-next-time-just-wright-lyrics

To go up to the boat - and start robbin' old folks
Now see you done messed with the wrong old lady
You done went wild; yo, check it...

There was a Hardy Boy mystery I tried to solve again
Dude that broke in my crib - it wasn't involvin him
Four in the mornin, my phone ringin
I'm thinkin, ""Who da fuck is this,"" on the other line screamin
Told em, ""Geek down,"" but they was breathin hard
It was my grandmother tellin me that she had been robbed
I told her hold (hold) tight (tight), I'd be right over
Freezin but this situation made the night colder
Knew this was the night (that what?) that she played poker
With some friends in a club at the boat gettin bub'
Said she seen these thugs on the boat for a while (uhh)
Not gamblin but every now and then they'd smile
Then BLAOW! They up mags
And told everybody, ""Put your shit in the bag""
Made people strip naked, quicker than a Luke record (what?)
Had the place took in a minute and some seconds
Asked her how many of it was em? (How many of it was em?)
Said she couldn't remember
She was spooked and buzzin, couldn't describe em
Cause it happened too fast (what?) said they looked like me
With they pants hangin off they ass
Got her some water - and begin to think
How these niggas take her wig, her bracelet and her mink?
Somebody round the crib know the deal (uhh)
Whoever did it better have Blue Shield for real
'Cause yo, it's the big payback..
{*cuts n scratches*, Com ad-libs}

Later that day I went to the 'shop, to see what was up
Them niggas probably knew somethin plus I needed a cut
Walked in they was playin Jigga (jihh-gga..)
Discussin how Da Brat titties done got bigger
These niggas next to me, was talkin bout the heist
Whoever did it even got Jordan for his ice
Said that it was done so precise the cops ain't know nut-nin
Had to use all my might not to ask no questions
Put down the magazine, went to the pop machine
Noticin these cats, had the Bling Bling
They wouldn't be talkin if they did it; it could be they team
A week ago neither one of these niggas had a ring
This hype came in, sellin CD's; said the BD's
Was braggin bout robbery they had done
By now, I'm thinkin bout my gun if I
See gramps bracelet
I'mma play racist (and what?) and make niggas run
It's the big payback..
{*cuts n scratches*, Com ad-libs}

My imagination roamed as I got in the chair
Thinkin - when shit went
Down, I wish I was there
Fuckin with fam' - who you are, I don't care
Have your guys pourin liquor witch'ya name in they swear
These chicks claim they was there, knew the niggas who done it
Said it was Smoke and them from the Wild 100's
Eight million stories got me runnin in place, it's gettin tricky
(Like who?) Like dude, that do drum'n'bass
There was a air in the place, that made me suspicious
Normally, they'd be
Talkin like bitches
My barber cut me with a quickness (what?)
Asked him where he got the new bracelet
He said it was his sister's - I knew then
What made it official, he gave me my change
The money clip had gramp's
Initials (c'mon)
As I, whooped his ass up, six niggas masked up
Pulled up in a Cadillac truck
{*gunfire*}

...we have an arson, three-alarm fire, murder in a possible homicide
The building is entitled ""The Ultimate Barbershop""
There are six unidentified bodies in the building
They are all presumed dead
I repeat they are all presumed dead
However there are no suspects
I repeat, the subjects are at large
We might need some backup..
Inform O'Malley that we need backup, over...
The skit definitely needs more siren added to it
Plus a new writer for the script, thank you...
Someone get Prince Paul on the phone please...
Thank you...",https://genius.com/Common-payback-is-a-grandmother-lyrics
Summer Madness,The Pursuit (EP),2011.0,"Is the sun in your eyes?
It's me again, No I.D. again, yeah, uh...

Black heat on the streets of desire
Some got rich and some got priors
My dogs hop barbed wires and steal cars with pliers
Wanna see more and be more like the wire
Live Via-Com from the city of Chi
But it's never quiet, huh
This is the noise of suppliers and buyers
Gangbangers that should've retired, food from deep fryers
I'm getting high thinking how to reach higher
Bald but these broads is my Delilah
Samsung pictures, more spit scriptures
Shorties hold liquor, flows get richer
It gets thick like my bro's little sister
Hormones got 'em thicker quicker
Pure souls that become boa constrictors
Mixed up like elixirs, trigger happy in the midst of
Summer madness

Is the sun in your eyes?
'Cause you're missing all the sights
But it's gonna be alright

It's summertime, niggas bring the heat out
Gun talk is how summer start to speak out
Shorties bear arms 'cause don't nobody reach out
Young frames leak out, aunties freak out
The front porch is sorta like the beach house
Niggas running bases with their cleats out
Every week now I'm getting texts about death
Leaving me out of breath
I gotta step to the stairway to heaven, it started on 87
Barack was playing sermons riding Reverend Clay Evans
I never really took it in like them youngsters
It's how I looked at them, maybe I should look again
'Cause death and prison sentences ain't how their book should end
When you go outside you still gotta look within
You can't scare 'em straight 'cause they keep a crooked grin
I hate to say it's fate, look at what could've been
It's summer madness

Summertime got you blind
I prefer your goddamn mind
Yeah, it's summer madness
But it's gonna be alright
It goes on in Chitown, yeah
It's gonna be alright
It goes on in Detroit, ATL
It's gonna be alright
To my peoples up in Brooklyn true, yeah
But it's gonna be alright
Out there in New York, Queens, Harlem
My West Coast people out in L.A., yeah
All the way to Alabama, you know, up there to Seattle
You know you got hoods all over",https://genius.com/Common-summer-madness-lyrics
Forever Black America Again,UnKnown,2016.0,"Come look into the eyes of a man named Gucci (Uh)
Got me peepin' out the blinds like Malcolm with the Uzi
 (Yea)
The government, the church, and the world is so polluted
They callin' me a criminal when I'm a revolution (Huh)
Woke up in a prison cell and I had a revelation
That my life's a testimony, I could be an inspiration (Yea)
From the 6 to the Chi, got so much in common
Gucci Mane and Common, did you see this comin'?
 (Go)
Nigga with an attitude, a hundred miles and runnin'
I done did some things so dirty that I wish I never done it (Wow)
All eyes on me, America's most wanted
It's so hard to be a Black man in a white man country (No)
Product of the slums with rich white folks' money (Yea)
And the police got no love for me, but I'm not scared of nothin' (No)
Mass incarcerate us, man and then they call it ""justice"" (Wha)
""Gucci how you feel?"" I'm so tired of the fuck shit 
(Wop)

Look me in my face, If you wanna know, yeah, yeah
I'll take you to a place, I know you wanna go
Black America, yeah
Black America

The Black diaspora
Supreme math into the after
Life, I live it for the master
Truck drivers passed us
Like Jeremiah and Jasper
Children of Zimbabwe and Madagascar
Africa unite, we on the move like runaway slaves through the night
I write, ""Freedom ain't far""
My North Star's more than a sports car
Taught by the ancestors who fought for our
Liberation army
Islam palmed me and calmed me
So the world couldn't blond me
Lectures by Kwame Ture
The ambiance of pan-Africanism
A man after wisdom of the ancients
I paint with words like the brushes of Kehinde Wiley
Black and proud, we wild
We wowed the world with Black magnificence
A symphony for the divine
And we the instruments, Black innocence

Look me in my face, If you wanna know
I'll take you to a place, I know you wanna go
Black America, yeah
Black America

I confess, I've been part of the problem
As of lately, I'm tryin' to solve 'em
I sold dope and I still talk the jargon
Just like Malcolm 'fore the X was on him
All these years later, we still the target
Look at Ferguson, Brooklyn and Charlotte
Sellin' CDs, reachin' for wallets
Trayvon'd be in his last year of college
I still mourn for Christopher Wallace
What happened in Dallas does not give me solace
So I acknowledge my flaws, apolige
Hey young world, just givin' you the knowledge
The knowledge

Look me in my face, If you wanna know
I'll take you to a place, I know you wanna go
Black America, yeah
Black America

I'll take you there, To get in, oh
Black America
Look me in my face, If you wanna know
I'll take you to a place, I know you wanna go

Pop’s Rap III,Like Water for Chocolate,2000.0,"Hey, hey old bean
And you to baby sweetness
Yeah, this is Pops, and I'm back in the studio
And I didn't have to break in this time
I'm back as a special guest by special request
And I want to thank my son for loaning me this microphone once again
They may have to rassle to get it back
You know, as a result of my son Common touring the world
Pops has acquired a wonderful extended family
From around the globe
He has returned with positive messages to my earlobes
From all my children From Mexico, Brazil, Italy, Japan
And of course in the motherland
Even in the orient, they know what I meant
Nanaan, tanaan, tinaan, hanchinaan
So I didn't come in here to give any shouts out
I came to give praise and honor and to identify my children
Who've been saying and doing the right things
You know they sat on those nines of 1999
And kept them from turning upside down
And teaching the babies
To love, to be able to give love
And to enter the new century with their own prophecy
The century of amends
You see I deal with the premise that all children are ours
And that we all travel the same path
It's just that we don't get there at the same time
(See you next lifetime) See you next lifetime
And to my children running around here
Talking about how nice is they ice
That they've already paid for twice
What karat is they gold
That was yours before you were done in the hole
Or that crew from 1629, buy some land
Think agriculture; beat that neighborhood
Which you claim you love so dear
Are you mankind or what kind of a man?
See, Pops is straight out of the garden
From when the world was starting brand new
Hip Hop, Hip Hop, the language of the Underground Railroad
In it's purest form
Yeah true hip hop is just like the Underground Railroad
If the message is not for you
It can sit on your nose and your brain remain froze
So when you see me traveling on a spiritual high
I'm flying high with Cee-Lo
Or maybe watching my long's heart dancing to a De La flow
Everybody knows there's no fruit on the tree without The Roots
And Black Star said we are what we are
The Knowledge Of Self Determination
And my little homie KG
Up there in Minnesota milking 10000 lakes
Keep the heat on em', we got to be kind to the growing mind
So if your heart is real
You will hear Big Will, and Mrs. Lauryn Hill
If your love is true, you will hear Badu-ism
And you can't go right until you go left
And get some ingredients from the music chef Jazzy Jeff
Children, I've traveled this globe
North to south, east to west
And whenever my soul appears lost
I follow the musical sounds of a Tribe Called Quest
Okay, we ready to get out of here
We ready to take it home now
Just so everybody knows
When Pops get ready to say something good
I mean when it's time for me to lay it on the wood
And it ain't no time for no shecky shecky
That's when I turn to a Black Girl Named Becky
Y'all looking for the only truth and it doesn't exist
I just come to give love and peace and honor to all my children",https://genius.com/Common-pops-rap-iii-lyrics
"Between Me, You & Liberation",Electric Circus,2002.0,"She rested her head upon my chest
Sensed liberation in between breaths
Wonder if sex is what she found it in
Peace, found it laying down with men
Wasn't there to judge her, many ways I loved her
It was more than bodies we shared with each other
We layed under the cover of friends
A place where many lovers began
I began, to feel her body shake in my hand
Body language, it's so hard tryna understand
Usually after sex, it's a good feel
Took by silence, emotion stood still
I could feel, her tears spill from her grill
Hurt from before that began to build
She told me, ""Hold me"", a story she assembled it
Tellin' it, trying not to remember it
It was a story of innocence taken
Thought she could redeem, through love makin'
When she was eight, she was raped by her father
And tried to escape through multiple sex partners
Felt pitiful, she had only learned
To love through the physical, inside it burned
My heart turned, I thought of what this man did
She forgave him, she grew to understand it
Her soul was tired and never really rested
Only through men, through aggression
Said it was a blessing and it happened for a reason
By speaking it, she found freedom
Between me and you

Sometimes I wish a, careless whisper
Still could be heard, without speaking a word
Because of you I'm stronger, I'm afraid no longer
I feel so alive in me, you help liberate me, me, me

She laid, I watched her breathe
Happy to be here, not afraid to leave
I couldn't concieve her not being here
Death in her face her not having fear
Less than a year, she was diagnosed with it
Memories of that year, so close and vivid
Happiness, would only visit, once in a while
To watch an adult, becoming a child
Somehow, I knew she'd make it
The life of one so given early, would God take it?
Hurt she placed in, hope and prayer
Hurt she placed in chemo and lost hair
I stare with my eyes closed
Wonder when the body leave, does the mind go?
Watchin' Jordan became less important
Seeing this disease eat away my aunt's organs
According to doctors, there's no cure
We went through doubt, and cases of insure
Wish I knew then how to heal with herbs
Knew a part of her I could heal with words
But the creator was sending for her
What seemed like the end was the beginning for her
Like that, she didn't want us to remember her
No more medication did she want us to give to her
It spread from her liver to her lungs to her last breath
Only to be freed through death
Between me and you, between me and you
Between me and you, between me and you

Sometimes I wish a, careless whisper
Still could be heard, without speaking a word
Because of you I'm stronger, I'm afraid no longer
I feel so alive in me, you help liberate me, me, me

He spoke with his eyes, tear-filled
A lump in his throat, his fear built
My whole life it was instilled
This ain't the way that men feel
A feeling, he said he wish he could kill
A feeling, not even time could heal
This is how real life's supposed to be?
For it to happen to someone close to me?
So far we'd come, for him to tell me
As he did, insecurity held me
I felt like he failed me
'Til his spirit yelled help me
I'd known him for like what seemed forever
About going pro we dreamed together
Never knew it would turn out like this
For so long he tried to fight this
Now it was no way for him to ignore it
His parents found out and hated him for it
How could I judge him?
Had to accept him if I truly loved him
No longer he said had he hated himself
Through sexuality he liberated himself
Between me and you, between me and you
Between me and you, between me and you

Sometimes I wish a, careless whisper
Still could be heard, without speaking a word
Because of you I'm stronger, I'm afraid no longer
I feel so alive in me, you help liberate me, me, me

Liberation, peace",https://genius.com/Common-between-me-you-and-liberation-lyrics
Gladiator,Universal Mind Control,2008.0,"Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
Nothing you could do (straight up)
There's nothing you could do (you know the boy is serious)
There's nothing you could do
I don't even know why you wanna play with it
There's nothing you could do

They say he's a radical, he don't fit the game
A heart full of glory and a fist of pain
A couple of battle scars but shit's the same
Are you not entertained?
So all the onlookers and the bystanders
Wait 'til intermission, run, buy your cameras
Record the moment, cause it'll be platinum
And you could say you seen Common rock the stadium
The gladiator

I was told by a wise old to come from the heart
Though I might've did ""The Light"", I don't run from the dark
The dark knight to spark mics and start fights
The warrior archetype like Kimbo Slice
It's strength in the beard, am I loved or feared?
A beast amongst boys, like Paul I'm revered
Vroof, vroof-vroof vroof-vroof-vroof, well
Like Jacob Jewel, I keep clientele
You frail on the mic like you might break a nail
I might smoke a joint but I won't take the L
I knew a fat broad that broke the scale
Still touched down cause I was off Martell
Had dreams of breaking Mike Vick out of jail
Took the underground rail to the NFL
I rebel in YSL
Here to leave a trail like Nelson Mandel'

There's nothing you could do
Man, why you wanna go against me?
There's nothing you could do (you've seen where I'm from)
There's nothing you could do (you've seen what I do)
There's nothing you could do

They say he's a radical, he don't fit the game
A heart full of glory and a fist of pain
A couple of battle scars but shit's the same
Are you not entertained?
So all the onlookers and the bystanders
Wait 'til intermission, run, buy your cameras
Record the moment, cause it'll be platinum
And you could say you seen Common rock the stadium
The gladiator

My words is the sword, my skill is the shield
My life is the style, I stay dressed to kill
A legend like Will, Smith with the steel
I could save the world when shit get for real
The skinny George Foreman, all in your grill
My rhyme style is blind, it's all in the feel
Touch it and watch the blood fall with the steel
The weak raps you wrote you could call that your will
My drive (VROOM!) is how I stay the livest
Your guys got you gassed, my flow is a hybrid
Crashed I survived it, gashes over eyelids
You easy to take out cause you hot garbage
I'm amped like wattage—the truth, nigga, honest
Any moment opponents drop out like college
Kneel and pay homage to the rap Ziggy Stardust
Stadium, hands in the air, fists balled up

There's nothing you could do (you know what it is)
There's nothing you could do (the boy is raw)
There's nothing you could do (so who next?)
There's nothing you could do

They say he's a radical, he don't fit the game
A heart full of glory and a fist of pain
A couple of battle scars but shit's the same
Are you not entertained?
So all the onlookers and the bystanders
Wait 'til intermission, run, buy your cameras
Record the moment, cause it'll be platinum
And you could say you seen Common rock the stadium
The gladiator

Feet in the dirt, blood on the shirt
Scars over bars, symbols of the work
Tight clothes the armor, center of the drama
Defeat your whole army like this is Sparta
So don't violate or you'll get violated
Some of you model bitches is so overrated
Don't mean to underrate it but damn it, I made it
In the water I waded, on the corner I painted
Draw blood like we related
MCs get de-decapitated
Syncopated is the style that I fight with, write with
Mr. Excitement, change your face up like a white chick
Then light shit, up like a dread with the herbs
Get sex in the city and head in the burbs
These are the words of a radical
The crowd applaud, I'm bowed, I'm proud
To be the gladiator

There's nothing you could do
How could you even question this?
There's nothing you could do
There's nothing you could do (now you know)
There's nothing you could do (the future)

They say he's a radical, he don't fit the game
A heart full of glory and a fist of pain
A couple of battle scars but shit's the same
Are you not entertained?

Dug Inf on production, my man Com for the discussion
Check it

One day, I was tryin' to be myself
The same day this thug say, ""You gotta come hard!""
Nigga, times is hard, I'm tryin' hard to make it
It ain't hard to tell, it's hard for me to fake it
Plus, it's hard to be me, it's hard to stop drinkin'
I guess it's hard for you hard niggas to start thinkin'
Pussy MC's stinkin' so I can't get hard
Some, become MC's cause it's hard to get a job
Hard for you to trust people, you don't trust in God
Even harder to be the Gods we created to be
This Western way of life ain't native to me
Put one nigga in your Pulp Fiction and relate it to me?
I hate it that we, the only race that call our women hoes
Niggas, be too hard to say ""ho"" at the shows
I rose like a florist to bring the flavor like a Taurus
Might not have the murderous verse, but I stay hard to the chorus
Took this girl to work, she say I ain't have a real job
Like that dick you had last night, baby, I work real hard
Simple motherfuckers tellin' me hard is criminal
Niggas you thought was hard, you pourin out your liquor for
Years ago, I thought I was hard, in high school fightin'
Now, I'm the hardest man working in show business
Handle your business or shut the fuck up

It's just one too many niggas got cars and no land
One too many niggas with cash and no plan
One too many niggas that's tryin to MC
That's one too many niggas comin up to me
That's one too many niggas
Just one too many niggas
That's one too many niggas
That's one too many niggas
Just one too many niggas
""One, two""
Forever, I ain't gon' be rappin
Shit that happened to me, I gotta let niggas know
This mark asked me do I know his cousin Jimbo
Nigga, I don't even know myself
You want me to get you in
Jack, I'm trying to get through the do' myself
Opportunity knocked, but he ain't call 'fore he came
Yeah, I got a name, but only twenty dollars to it
Next album you gon' blow, up my ass, you done blew it before
Being in my video, what's that gonna do for your life?
Get you some pussy? you should be gettin' rump off GP
Quit that you look like you say I seen you on TV
I be readin' niggas but readin' be makin' me sleepy (Hey!)
So strong am I, A Hundred Styles and Runnin
Niggas stuck on one and then I ran by
Claimin' they fly but they stand-by
I come truer than a dream, and you's a damn lie
With that anti-rap, complainin' about this and about that
Sounding bitch-like, that ain't gonna make a nigga get right
I'm number one

One too many niggas tryin' to tell me bout they theory
One too many niggas that ain't tryin' to hear me
One too many niggas doin' shows that don't happen
One too many niggas life depend on rappin'
That's one too many niggas
Just one too many niggas

Fifth Story,Let Love,2019.0,"They dated three years before they got married
Lived next door to my homeboy Merry
Right in South Shore where the bodies get buried
Her family Jamaican, she nice with the curry
Like Steph, she step back and splash spices
Kit Kats and cakes was her vices
Vanilla icing with the strawberry
She was lactose so she rarely ate dairy
Her husband named Terry, knew where to get the good cake
Vegan, black-owned for the hood's sake
Today was one of them days, she couldn’t wait
And she got off work a lil' late
Shortcake, after a long day, the smell of perfume in the hallway
Terry open the door like, ""What up, bae?""
Nigga actin' like it’s just another day
She dropped her bags, quickly kissed him
She was on a mission, went straight to the kitchen
Looked at the cake and noticed it was different
Thinkin' to herself, ""Why this nigga get this one?""
Opened the box there was two pieces missin'
Is it just suspicion or a woman's intuition?
Terry moved positions to give her a hug
Right then, she noticed lipstick on the mug

Damn, this muhfuh-
Supposed to be the nigga that loved ya
If he did this, that's fucked up
You know we gon' lie like Russia
Now I gotta spy, asked a few things and he did reply
Tryna see truth lookin' deep in his eye
I'ma need proof or he gon’ deny
Pissed thinkin’ 'bout a bitch feedin’ this guy

It's crazy, I was thinkin' you were my baby
Wasn't looking both ways, you played me
Now you running away from blamin’, so crazy
You gon' make me wanna go and get real again
You gon' make me have to go and get real again
You were driving me crazy and now I'm feelin' it
So don't speak I don't wanna hear your synonyms

She like, ""Damn, damn"" like Kendrick from Compton
Wonderin' if her man on some Tristan Thompson
Is it reality or in her conscious?
That's wild if they did it in they apartment
The nerve of this nigga
She gon' have to swerve on this nigga
Put the clothes on the curb of this nigga
He even changed the shirt, 'cause this nigga
Must be into something
Whole house clean, could tell he was frontin'
She went to the back, the trash, he had dumped 'em
The bedroom, the bathroom, trash, he had dumped 'em
Usually 'round the crib he don't ever do nothin'
Huntin' and sniffin' around for what's relevant
Might get to sniffin' his nuts like a elephant
Some niggas is anti-intelligent
That bullshit, he kept on selling it
Like a traphouse
His story was the neighbor got locked out and had to come over
Birth of a salesman, he almost sold her
'Til she saw strands of blue hair on the shoulder
Sittin', cussin' on the couch at her spot
Saw ""Love & Hip Hop"" was recently watched
Something that he wouldn't watch
She thinkin', ""Terry, you shoulda kept ya dick in a box""

Damn, this muhfuh-
Supposed to be the nigga that loved ya
If he did this, that's fucked up
You know we gon' lie like Russia
Now I gotta spy, asked a few things and he did reply
Tryna see truth lookin' deep in his eye
I'ma need proof or he gon' deny
Pissed thinkin' 'bout a bitch feedin' this guy

It's crazy, I was thinkin' you were my baby
Wasn't looking both ways, you played me
Now you running away from blamin', so crazy
You gon' make me wanna go and get real again
You gon' make me have to go and get real again
You were driving me crazy and now I'm feelin' it
So don't speak I don't wanna hear your synonyms

When she stressed out, she start eatin'
Went to the kitchen for that cake she was tweakin'
He gave reasons, now she believin'
He care too much to be out here cheatin'
Like she freezin', his arms wrapped around her
From wild wild, to a calm that's around her
Terry thinkin' he gon' put her on that counter
She like quiet, he gon' make her get louder
She found a knife for the cake to start cuttin'
Terry said ""Stop"", all of a sudden
""Baby, I must've been on one
This got dairy in it, I got the wrong one""
The phone rung, it was the bakery he got the cake from
To make her feel good, he put it on speaker
So she wouldn't be insecure like Issa
The clerk said, ""Mr. Terry, yo, you left your VISA
And it was really real good to meet your wife
Her blue hair was fresh, her perfume was nice""
Things got ice, ice
He about to feel that spice, spice
She remember goin' up flights smellin' perfume
And seein' blue hair in the bathroom
As Terry mumbled, tellin' his story
She pushed him out the window of the fifth story",https://genius.com/Common-fifth-story-lyrics
My City,One Day It’ll All Make Sense,1997.0,"This the city of Chicago
The state of confusion
The style I'm using is free
Or at least it would be if my mind was
Peep I'm behind cause
I didn't handle my function while in high school
Although I was cool
The hood I live in ain't that proper
Cause a cop a stop ya
And have you at a hundred and eleventh before you can say not guilty
I'm not filthy
Nor am I rich
Ain't that a bitch
Like life is
Not your wife is
See that your better halve
Do your math
And peep that two halves make a whole
And all I have to hold
Is my self pride
So these streets I strive
Like a Black Panther
Asking can the
Situation get much worst
All I do is try to appeal to the masses
As the phrase keep it real passes
The teeth of too many phoney individuals
Snakes, that smooth like criminals
They create chemicals
That the Earth hate
Doing their damndest to decrease my birth rate
I'd settle for lesser knowing I'm worth wait
Or at least my weight in precious gems
So I'm steadily steadly steadly
Trying to lose my religion, like R E M
Created in His own image so are we him?
And through all this crises
Shid(Shit) I wonder where Christ is
Well he damn sure not in K town or the wild hundreds
Where they broadcast G.D. till the world blow-up
And Stone run it
Hunted by police for display in state vile cages
Come out to make minimum wages
And with a desiese that are contagious
It is fucking outrages
The amounts of Black and Brown they lock up
But the Most High encourages me to put the Glock up
And Stock up on do for self knowledge
A brother couldn't afford to go to collage
So I had to learn form the school of hard knock
On the hard blocks of the Chi
Even I, think about moving out to River Oaks
As my liver soaks
In mad Hennesy
Cause I got a bad tendency
To do a lot of drinking
But now I do a lot of thinking
Blinking, was your third eye
When you heard I
Was one of the chosen one
Industry doors keep closing
(sing) Watch the closing doors
Niggas want a record deal
But can they deal with a record?
Cause once they get rich
They tend to switch
Like a sissy
Please miss me
With all that bullshit you popping
This knowledge I'm gonna keep dropping
Even if you had one of them red octagon
Motherfuckers say Malik how you make your living?
I say by breathing oxygen",https://genius.com/Common-my-city-lyrics
I Am Music,Electric Circus,2002.0,"Candy sweet, your words of bedtime
I was just saying to myself the other day
Most don't believe in the magician, but you're bewitching
Because of this I must say
I (I) I (oh I)
I, appreciate what you give to me, yeah
(I) I (oh I)
I, appreciate what you give to me, yeah

People say I got soul
, 
look at all the records I hold
The lives I've affected, connect and control
With me in your basement your mama got blowed
I provide the vibe to keep the strippers on poles
Through me the black experience is glorious told
From a school that's old, bold, so I rock gold
And platinum, some cats I hold notes and cash for them
On streets I rap with them, in ghettos I blast for them
Mash with them, at the party and all
Be the universal language that's embodying all
Put the Billie Holiday, Bob Marley in y'all
Y'all feel most high, when I be in y'all
System,
 
with the rhythm I up jump the boogie
Shame I rely on record labels to push me
Since the bush, I been y'all way to escape
Through eight-tracks, wax, CD's and tapes
I am music

You can feel me all over alive
, I help culture survive
I opened the eyes of many
Styles y'all wrote in the skies with your lows and highs
Open your mind to hear me
In the streets I beat cops and obsolete
On every station that's hot, you can't stop my heat
I taught 
Jay
 and 
Dre
 how to rock the beat
On what's going on today, yo, I gots to speak
I take the stand, yo, you could feel me bam
Whether in Larry Graham or Steely Dan
Live I be killing it man
For how long I survived, yo I'm realer than man
Got a soft side but I'm still a man
For me, women cry, and children dance
I'm tryna eat, I coulda got a meal and ran
But like Sly for the fam, still I stand
I am music

I been here since the beginning
Beginning of time, yo, beginning of time
Deep in the mind of the ancient ones
Everybody love me like they do the sun
I shine at times, yo, at times I'm dark
You can't categorize me, my mind's a art
Inside my heart, it ain't about climbing charts
I'm the one you roll with when you're riding smart
The change that came, the change that comes
I change with chords and I kick it with drums
Get blown with horns and did it on the one
Riffed for guitars, for the Lord I sung
Spun around the world at parties and weddings
Wherever I go, I create the setting
You know me from lessons or your pop's collection
Whether whole or half stepping, I'm a blessing
Yo, I am music

Play Your Cards Right,Finding Forever,2007,"Yeah... ohhh... (3x)

Ohhh...
Everything's gone be alright
If you play your cards right
Everything's gone be alright...

It's do or die, your looking through the eye of a revolver
I revolve around the world, a problem solver
Alter your ego, and the way your walkin'
Talk to people, still I stay regal
Read through the bullshit
Sometime to make peace, you need a full clip
Roll dice with niggas who got bricks at a good price
Talk shit, give good advice, rollin' through the 'hood right
It's the good life, like T.I. said
Gettin' it, how could I not be fed
Get bread, get dough, get fed, get mo'
In the old school Lincoln, thinking I sit low
Let problems burn slow away
I yearn for the day that it won't go gray
Remember we were kings, back in the day
Still can be, depending on the cards you play

If you play (if you play), your cards right (cards right)
Everything... gone be alright (well... alright (3x))

I ain't playin' with a full deck
The government won't let me get a full check
I'm taxin' marks, I got more heart than clubs
The black spade, givin' 'em darker love
Make 'em strip, like poker poker mag in his face
You tried to smoke my ace, you know the stakes
It's high like the ace is
Get your squad face down like cards, before they get a facelift
You get robbed, better yet jacked for diamonds
Leave you nickle-less, like Jack in ""Shining""
Blocked your bluff, now your respect is stolen
Took your chips, let my guys in Texas Hold 'Em
Rolled the strips of Vegas, with money boss players
Stacey Adams of different flavors, we major
Gangstas and hustles, living moviestar life
Dealt a bad hand, but I played my cards right

If you play (if you play), your cards right (cards right)
Everything... gone be alright (well... alright (3x))

Ohh...
If you play (if you play), your cards right (cards right)
Everything's... gone be alright (well... alright (3x))

8 Minutes to Sunrise,Music Inspired By the Motion Picture Wild Wild West ,1999.0,"Yeah, yo, yo, yo-yo, yo, yo
Yo, a touch of jazz y'all, yeah, yeah
?? y'all, yo they got us on the run, like

8 minutes to sunrise
Oh baby now, what are we gonna do? (I don't know..)
Pressure is mountin'
Oh baby now, how we gonna get through? (I, don't, know)
Can't go left (uh-uh) can't go right (uh-uh)
Don't know, how we made it through the night (c'mon c'mon c'mon)
7 minutes to sunrise
Oh baby now, what are we gonna do? (Do it, do it..)

It was once said by Black Thought that Things Fall Apart
Knew I shouldn't have been messin with dude's girl from start
But I pimp from the heart, the art of it made it interestin'
Plus me and sister blend before we got intimate
Friend or no friend, my man caught wind
This chick is payin' me, it'll either cost me or cost him
Told her she shoulda lost him (when?) a while ago
'Cause dude'll drink a pile of Mo' and defile her yo
I ain't here to start on this  for me to wreck his broad
You could tell what I thought of this 
Nickname was Smoke, don't know if that was 'cause of cigarettes
(or what?) or guns he tote, he called shots on the deck
So I wasn't tryin' to call his bluff, by his persona
You could see, he think he tough!
If that wasn't enough, old girl had his son
This is Wild like the West I'm like Jesse on the run, uhh

6 minutes to sunrise
Oh baby now, what are we gonna do? (I don't know..)
Pressure is mountin'
Oh baby now, how we gon' get through? (I, don't, know)
Can't go left and (uh-uh) can't go right and (uh-uh)
Don't know, how we made it through the night (yo, we got..)
5 minutes to sunrise
Oh baby now, what are we gonna do? (Do it, do it..)

I understand that time is runnin' out, I'm thinkin' of town-skippin'
Got a Chevy but the alternator be trippin'
I'm hittin' rum straight, thinkin' of a route to truncate
The streets is watchin', out is one way I put myself in his Nike's
His position is, ""Aight man, somebody bonin' my lady""
Probably snap like Rod-man
My plan was to meet at this bar called the Tiki (when?)
'round four, when she was comin' she would beep me
I sat deep in the corner, drinkin' zombies, becomin' one by now
Wonderin' if my style would support her and her child
Out the corner of my eye saw this stud I recognized (who?)
One of Smoke's guys, to stay out of sight I tried
Told Jill Scott to meet we coulda picked a better spot
On some ""Nobody's Supposed to Be Here""  like Deborah Cox
Looked at my watch,  I don't even got a watch
Felt for my Glock, damnit I don't even got a Glock, yo

4 minutes to sunrise
Oh baby now, what are we gonna do? (I don't know..)
Pressure is mountin'
Oh baby now, how we gon' get through? (I, don't, know)
Can't go left and (uh-uh) can't go right and (uh-uh)
Don't know, how we made it through the night (c'mon c'mon)
3 minutes to sunrise
Oh baby now, what are we gonna do? (Do it, do it..)

Pressure puh-pressure what? The pressure's cookin'
It ain't good lookin', like a black promoter I'm talkin' bookin'
Not that I'm spooked of dude, I could whoop him
But he was on the horn informin' the rest of them hoodlums (aight)
Usually I wouldn't fight over a woman, old girl had a sun-shine
Was messed up, on Smoke's payroll was one-time
My pager went off, it read one line: ""Come get me
From Halsted"", I'm thinkin' this is monkey bar 
Went to the phone quick, called her (what happened?) Her line was busy
Situation number nine, got my mind dizzy
Wondered if this plan was designed to get me
I've been drinkin' too strong to be thinkin' too long
Like 40 goin' North I'm doin' 50, headed for the spot
Askin' God to be with me, and lately
She has been actin' shifty -- (but what?)
But then it hit me (hit me) it hit me (hit me)
It hit me (hit me) it hit me

2 minutes to sunrise
Oh baby now, what are we gonna do? (I don't know..)
Pressure is mountin'
Oh baby now, how we gonna get through? (Yo -- I said I, don't, know)
Can't go left and (uh-uh) can't go right and (nope)
Don't know, how we made it through the night (yo, we got)

Oh baby now, what are we gonna do? (one-one, one.. ha?)

""Gimme a pound, thank you man""
""Gimme a pound, thank you man""
""Gimme a pound, thank you man""
""Gimme a pound, thank you man""

I'm as ""bad, bad"" as Leroy Brown-Brown
Yo I'm a pro-pro, but not a noun-noun
If you got beef beef, then you'll get ground-ground
Cut up and sold-sold, by the pound-pound
I'm going downtown like Julie Brown, I'm the round mound
Not of rebound, but like a hound, I get down-down
Never wore a leash but I get loose
Producin somethin fresher than fruits
Got more soul than combat boots
Diggin two scoops of raisins for the troops out of some blazers
So amazin like Luther everyday Joe but not Bazooka
I used to be a hooper but now I troop to shoot a free flow
Me go with mi amigo, to see the man named Chico
The legal alienaeno, I roll the instrumentals
Like Jack I be like Nimble never gentle to a bimbo
Not your sex symbol so save that soft stuff for the Care Bears
The way I freak the funk OHHHH the Monkees sayin, ""Hell yeah""
Correction, ""Hell yes""; old folks wanna cuss
On how I walk talk and dress, they say my life's a mess
But I'm straight, are you straight? If you straight, then I'm straight
Rock me tonight, just for old time's sake

Back to our regularly scheduled program, program
I am so damn flam, I slam a slam, BAM, I slam
Like Conan the Barbarian, if you talk loud, I'll play librarian
Cause see I want it quiet in here...
I Mark a Marky and a bunch of funky Uncle Thomases
Play like Christopher Williams cause I gotta keep my promises
To stick to my roots and not dilute cause G this ain't two colors
I'm tired of seein these non rappin dancin motherfuckers

""Gimme a pound, thank you man""
""Gimme a pound, thank you man""
""Gimme a pound, thank you man""
""Gimme a pound, thank you man""

For a record sale a nigga'll sell his soul to go gold
And reach a large scale, sellin for the pale male
And I can't tell, why for a ho you grow a tail
And stop drinkin ale, the booty probably smell
Ain't no pussy worth a sale at least not for the kid to do a bid
Shit you musta flipped you lid, you was wit you slipped you slid
Got doodoo skids on my paper cause I got rhymes up the ass
If I pass gas, ducks fast or gets trimmed like a mustache
I must ask what's goin on with rap, white kids actin black
It's like McDonald's sellin fatback
Get back to your Mac, that stuff is wack with all these dancetracks
I'm hearin rap from Anthrax, my time the Caravan cracks
You're wack, that's the only thing that's black Scooter
When we was on the streets, you was at home on your computer
I'mma shoot a diss well like a fist to all these wack groups
Rhymes are wack as hell! And they sample wack loops
I'm wonderin how the hell they get a deal I still can't see that far
I feel like Cypress Hill, I could just kill an A&R
Or whoever's in Charge, it surely ain't Charles
But you ain't G-in hip-hop, cause it's ours

""Gimme a pound, thank you man""
""Gimme a pound, thank you man""
""Gimme a pound, thank you man""
""Gimme a pound, thank you man""

It's sick you sick I'm sicker, I flick a flea flicker
Think of that boa constrictor but the venom I inflicta
Is stricter, I stick I stick the stinkin to a stunk
If soda was a forty dog, then I would be like drunk
If if was a fifth I would lift the fifth and a spliff
It's not a myth about our dick width
I'm swift and I shoot the presents
In essence count your blessings I got a Wessun if you riff
I'm a nigga with SOULLLLLLLLLL
My last name should be Smith-sonian
I'm gassin girls heads, just like petroleum
Get em ready to bone me and, then I play custodian
And turn off the lights this is the likes of a
Ticketing wallowing high jumping radio rumping brother
Got Seoul like Korea gimme an inch I'll take a liter
A chick is a chick that's how I treat her
Never go pop I'm not a two liter
A true leader, don't choose to follow, choose what I swallow
Whether water or a beer bottle, of course I play the lotto
Wear em? No, share em? A ho
I like the girls the girls I share a life with a bro
Cause U-A-C is family, much tighter than foundations
That holds up the walls, so you better proceed with caution

Memories of Home,Let Love,2019.0,"My first memory, my birthday on a party bus
Pops wasn't there but that wasn't obvious
In Mom's arms, in God we trust
Black Mama love, everything marvelous
I didn't know what I was missin', part of a system
Pops is gone, Uncle in prison
Inside wishin' for men to teach me 'bout girls and religion
Made my own rendition of grindin' and kissin'
Weekend calls to my Dad I'd listen
Still I felt distant, distant like love
There's only so far that words could really hug
Didn't wanna be a thug, older niggas I banged with
I learned a lot from them cuts in the basement
The smell of blunts laced with a little bit of spice
Wise, high niggas, giving me advice
We go out and start fights, scuff up our Nikes
Come back to talk crap and shoot a little dice
This is a slice of life and memories
Sittin' in my mind vividly, often they visit me

Oh baby
Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da (Oh, oh)
I'm just tryna find a way to understand (I'm tryna understand)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
How do I rewind the tape and live in it? (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Stayin' out late and playin' in Wonderland (Ooh-ooh, oh-oh-oh)
Is it in God's plan?
I'm just tryna find my way to understand it

Metaphors can't explain how far I came
A young man at work, I made my own lane
Steered away from pain, relied on drive
There's a old saying, ""Don't cry, survive""
As I kept building there were cranes in the sky
Certain memories my brain would deny
A tear laid in my eye, I was afraid to reply
To the hurt that was callin', it came from the sky
An older play cousin, of course I trust him
But he was touchin' where he wasn't supposed to be touchin'
What's a kid supposed to do?
When they goin' through, what I was goin' through
Don't know who to go to
You want to tell somebody
In many ways, I failed somebody
That somebody was me
Now I'm talking to little Rasheed
Incarcerated heart, man, you gotta be free
I felt it, when I told my man I would help with
Things he was dealin' with I really hadn't dealt with
Emotions meltin', I began to release it
Things you can't change, you could come to peace with
At least get it better for the children of forever
I read the Lord's letter, I forgive our debtors
They don't talk about it, maybe sharing their story
Memories of home, shared pain and glory

Oh baby
Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da (Oh, oh)
I'm just tryna find a way to understand (I'm tryna understand)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
How do I rewind the tape and live in it? (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Stayin' out late and playin' in Wonderland (Ooh-ooh, oh-oh-oh)
Is it God's plan?
I'm just tryna find my way to understand it

Said I'm tryna understand, understand, understand, understand

Pop’s Rap,Resurrection,1994.0,"I just dropped by the studio, see what my son does
My main man, my son Common Sense
They used to call me no sense
Now they say I got plenty sense - about 6,000 years of it
You know, I’m just checking him out
See what’s going on, cause I’m always sitting around telling him about
What we used to do back in our hood, you know
We used to be down and run this town
And it was all at PC Pub
You know, and I’m shaking
And they working on it, and they bringing it back
I see harmony, understanding
And they working on that love thing too
Cause they be down with it, you know?
Now I hear them saying things like, whoa whoa, I get a good feeling
I be saying “keep it up
Keep on moving with your groove, you’re going the right way""
Cause it’s got to be in your heart
And I can tell by your beat you got it
See there, I can do a little piece, put them together there
Yea, we used to be running this whole town, here
We used to be basketball playing brothers, you know
Now everybody’s playing basketball
I wonder where they come from? What they claiming?
Gonna make an old man get his shoes out
And throw one down to slam dunk on them
Every time the leaves start turning brown getting through the fall of the year
I can say yea it’s time to play some
What these youngsters talking about, they running out of breath?
What you say?
Well I tell what, we’re gonna try something brand new here
Cause everybody like new things
We’re gonna work on something new, and I’m gonna call it ‘peace’
We’re gonna pretend like its 6 years old
And we gonna build it and mould it
And nurture it and culture it
And grow right into our society for all of us to have
Do you believe in the peace?
Not that piece, but do you believe in the peace?
Alright, I see you raising your hand - you believe in the peace
OK, bring it
See if I can’t talk common sense into them
Let’s cruise on down to 47 St. where dad used to hang out at, you know?
Eh remember in a few years when we moved from 47 to 87
47 was my hood, 87 was his
Touchdown
What’s the name of the bangers in this town now?
Has everybody calmed down?
Back in my day, they was showing up, now they finally woke up
I hear they leaving it alone

Yeah, you really make my day
Ahh-haah-ohh...Ohh-ohh-ohh
Yeah, I think I like her
Cause she really makes my day
Yeah, she really makes my day
Ahh-haah-ohh...Ohh-ohh-ohh

Seen her on the beach, she was wrapped in a towel
Her body's so endowed, seen her ass, cracked a smile
Enjoying the Nile, taking the breeze in
On some cat and mouse and she was, just cheesing
The sun eased in our conversation
California dreamin' 'bout Californication
Said she had some drinks in the cooler and I had an invitation
If I wanted I could brew up, this is just an indication
Of how cool she was
A couple chicks came up with their groupie love
They ain't want no pictures, only to be hugged
I'm thinkin' DAMN, damn, that's really cool because
Sometimes I wanna chill
Sometimes the best things in life are not in your plans
You came to the sand and got more than a tan
Baby girl, I'm a man and we can do this my way
Take a ride on the highway and 
pretend like it's Friday and it is


She was at a barbecue
Pretty painted nails, she took off her shoes
She was 'show and tell' like it was grammar school
Sipping on some ale, I'm thinking, ""Man, she cool!""
Sun smiling on her hair
Hey, they playing spades and we can be a pair
She had a spread on her, I can see it from her chair
I love it when it's sunny, girl, you could be my Cher
It's, Independence Day and free is in the air
We danced and danced away, yo
Showed her how to step, it's like a tango
From her body angle, I can tell she like me
She got me a flav, girl you're sweet as Icee
Spicy talk, the sauce drip from my lips
Take tricks and let's dip, we can do something hip
Take a trip around the world in a day, play Fiona A
Let your worries blow away like it's all okay, and it is!",https://genius.com/Common-make-my-day-lyrics
Belly Breathe,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Breathe
Sometimes the monster that’s inside you
Is a monster that is mad
It’s a monster who is angry

When your monster wants to grow things
And your monster wants to shout

Belly breathe gonna breathe right through it

Belly breathe this is how you do it
Put your hands on your tummy now you’re ready to begin
Put your hands on your belly and you slowly breathe in

Next Time,UnKnown,UnKnown,"I'm gonna blow your mind, hold you close
Squeeze you tight, the next time that I see you
I'm gonna tell you I love you, cross my heart
And I hope I die
The next time that I see you

A cloudy day in the Chi
I was downtown getting my license
Money ain't a thang but hey, fame is priceless
Waiting in line, yeah that's one of my vices
This lady recognized me and moved me through the line quick
To number one, said sign this for her son
I drew my name with a Bible and a gun
One of her coworkers had a cousin in rap
Can't knock his hustle, but I be doing him like Skinny Pete
In the back, they was playin' light jazz
Spotted this woman with light plus she had a bright ass
I was checking her out trying to act like I ain't checking her out
She could see that I was checking her out
On some Roy Ayers, we was vibing a bit
Told her my next album gonna be live with the hits
She did a skit on how she don't be dating rappers
Said I got my SAG card baby I'm an actor
And after the laughter I said, ""naw for real""
She said, ""naw for real, forreal?""


Some days it's the sun, some days it's the rain
Some chicks you forget, some stay in your brain
Somehow in my mind this broad still remain
Three days later, I'm about to get on the plane
In the security lane, the thing kept beeping
It's probably these hard raps that I be keeping
Speaking of the goddess, I picked up my metal objects
You know how you can bring to life what's in your conscience
Slim with the pompous attitude from the DMV
Happened to have a beautiful ass in front of me
Yup, I'm looking and she sort of took it in
That awkward moment of ""damn, damn, that's him again""
I start telling her how beautiful her thoughts are
A man walked up, she said ""this is Walter""
I looked at a little Walter as he stuck out his hand
Said since Borrow a Dollar, he been a fan
Said he met me at a show about four years ago
I'm thinking Goof Troop, I don't remember that shit
I told him that I didn't so I ended that quick
On the Ice Cube tip, like stay off my dick
And tell your chick to come here
Yeah, I gotta word I want to give to her ear
And it goes like


I can't be lusting another man's woman too long
I picked up my pride to the gate, I moved on
With the nike airs on, stepping into first class
Wondering why these flight attendants don't be having no ass
One asked if I wanted a drink
I laid back and just said naw I wanted to think
About how and why old girl was affecting me
Opened my eyes her and dude was right next to me
Was this destiny like the Jackson Five?
I was shocked inside, but I reacted live
Told her every time I think of her she actualize
I said fate baby ain't something to rationalize
Seen passion in her eyes as my words hit her
She said Walter wasn't her nigga, he just work with her
We dipped to the bathroom so she could try my love
Now she's a member of the mile high club",https://genius.com/Common-next-time-lyrics
Food for Funk,One Day It’ll All Make Sense,1997.0,"What, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
Yo, yo yo yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
Check it, yo
You say a one for the trouble, two for the time
Come on y'all, let's rock that, uh

I can feel the funk

I come to grips with mics
I come to grips that a lot of mic users is dikes
I come to grips with the likes of Fred Hampton
Cold, so I'm lampin, with no need for spotlight
When I got light like an intersection, you talk
But you came to my town with protection
Election year, had the block hot
I scream ""fuck the world"" but having a baby girl sorta cock-blocked
I write rhymes like I come from the windy city
With my crew, I click like simply, stand midi with reality
Casually, I walk through these war games
Some claim saved but then they take on whore names
If that's the way your sex drives, stay in your lane
If you're a man, I can't tell like if the door rang now

Now, to the ladies in the house when you come in the place
It ain't a bunch of niggas all up in your face
The music is thumpin and you're feelin the bass
What you wanna do girl(wanna shout)
To the brothas when you come in a jam, it ain't a bunch of niggas
It ain't high tech and ain't got free liquor
You jackin his name and stick to make you jones get thicker
What you wanna do man?(let go)
Yo, check it

Some niggas be on the mic, sounding like dikes
Allow me to get on and bust like Spike(uh)
Lee, I'm in the majors with no rotation
Through stations of bullshit, I see through like a pager
In the age of Aquarius, various things
Is gonna carry us in intellect and what have you
Street astrologists interpret point stars and half moons
Then end up on garages or walls in bathrooms
Every black moon, a rap tune move me
The rap sun, I rain more than Rudy, that unruly shit is played
It don't stop
It's time to get it, get it made
I got my mind made up like Foxy Brown's face
I know how the underground tastes
I want a crib from the ground up, rooms spin at a round pace
Get down based on true story, through Corey, came close to the teachers
Colder as the Iceman, posted before it start wrinklin
Linkin with cats, who don't react to change in the years
Fulfill prophesies in rooms full of emptiness, now

I can feel the funk
I came through the corridor, with the aura
Raw Chicago mora, scope the horror
Read between the lines and know the border
Some pop wines for juice, I wait in the water
Waitin for you Big Willie niggas to have a show at The Crib
We gon get with your glamour, long as we know where it is
Tell you ain't a player by your sweater doused with wack feather
The Crib got the gangsta playa shit patent like black leather
I rap better than you, you, or maybe him
But I am like a tree and every lyric is a timb
Spilled brews and greasy foods got my car smelly
Some be so high, they believe they fly like R. Kelly
But then they fall off, dusted niggas is gettin sawed off
They fall soft, my mental lift is for me to haul off
I kick ass

I can feel the funk",https://genius.com/Common-food-for-funk-lyrics

We keep going so you can, yo, you can rock on
We keep going so you can, yo, you can rock on
We keep going

Nigga breathe, I can tell by how you rap you don't believe
Ain't hungry no more, so off me you feed
I hustle at a speed between greed and need
On the streets where intuition and weed are breed
Shoot the gift and viff, at the myths uplift
My rhyme the clip, it's like the boom bip to tip
In gangways where cats that rhyme the same way
Spending nights over Egypt to learn a brave day
Paint a picture of the ghetto like JJ
You're the Ray J of this rap world
I travel the globe with a black girl named Becky
Grand like Auto Theft 3
Style so developed, the law can't arrest me
You walk with blood on your shirt like Jesse
Jackson trying to test the reaction of the people
See through, tryna out act Don Cheadle
I speak to original Hebrews, you know how we do
And bleed through the needle with truth
That needs no preview to proof, it's in the people
And how they react, still in the business of smacking
Rappers is wack, you had a dope track, I guess opposites attract
My mind state is black, black like Bernie Mac
No cowards, soul power in the words we rap

As, as
As we walk together

Picks with fist
, thick grease, dark nipples
My guy buy ice, I search for the dark crystal
Racing for paper, these broads is starter pistols
I spit through gang wars and strange doors
Out the sky, flames pour, the beats claims war
I see niggas with flags, who they waving them for?
I'm the nigga, that you put the chain on the door for
The nigga, that you started changing the laws for
Orator of hardcore and more
My raps the portal for the blue collar
You made a hit and came up on a few dollars
I'd rather listen to silence than you holla
Borrowed your persona from the late that made Dear Mama
My realness is my armor that I wear up in this boy
For truth your a decoy
Common Sense is like the future of the B-boy
I fall down and get up like Don McClurkin
Hit push and listen to it whistle while I'm twerkin'
Break it down like herb
The nympho of info, I'm fucking what you heard
You ain't ready for war, you're stuck in the reserves
I mastered my high so I'm bucking at the birds
I've been wanting to fly so now I do it with the words
For those in the fast lane, I'll show you how to merge
Get your own
You see, it's like home grown herb black economics
The people we serve with soul power

As we walk together

Sway ABFF Freestyle,UnKnown,2016.0,"Hot damn, black America again
Think of Sandra Bland as I'm staring in the wind
The color of my skin, they comparing it to sin
The darker it gets the less fairer it has been
The hate, the hate made, I inherited from them
But I ain't gon' point the finger
We got anointed singers
Like Nina, Marvin, Billie, Stevie
Need to hear them songs
Sometimes to believe me
Who freed me, Lincoln or Cadillac?
Drinking or battle raps?
Or is it God's speed that we travel at
Endangered in our own habitat
Them guns and dope, man y'all can have it back
As a matter fact, we them lab rats
You built the projects for, now you want ya hood back
I guess if you could rap, you would express it too
That PTSD, we need professionals
You know what pressure do, it makes the pipes bust
From schools to prison y'all, they tryna pipe us
'Til your political parties invite us
Instead of making voting laws to spite us
You know, you know we from a family of fighters
Fought in, our wars and your wars, you put a nigga in Star Wars
Maybe you need two, and then maybe then we'll believe you
See black people, in the future, we wasn't shipped here
To rob and shoot ya
We hold these truths to be self-evident
All men and women are created equal, including black Americans
Yeah, that's black America again

We go here, we go here, here we go again
Trayvon'll never get to be an older man
Black children, they childhood stole from them
Robbed of our names and our language, stole again
Who stole the soul from black folk?
Same man that stole the land from chief black smoke
And made the whip crackle on our back slow
Made us go through the back door
And raffle black bodies on the slave blocks
Now we slaves to the blocks cause on 'em we spray shots
Leaving our own to lay in a box
Black mothers' stomach stay in a knots
We kill each other, more than the cops
I wish the hating would stop
We are at war, in a battle with us
I know that black lives matter, do they matter to us?
These are the things we gotta discuss
The new plantation, mass-incarceration
Instead of educate, they'd rather convict the kids
As dirty as the water in Flint, the system is
Is it a felony? or a misdemeanor?
Maria Sharapova making more than Serena
It took Viola Davis to say this
The roles of the help and the gangstas is really all they gave us
We need Avas, Ta-Nehisis, and Cory Bookers
The salt of the Earth, they get the salt with sugar
And greasy foods, I don't believe the news
Or radio, stereotypes we refuse
Brainwashed in the cycle to spin
We write our own story, black America again",https://genius.com/Common-sway-abff-freestyle-lyrics

It's a frantic situation
It's a frantic situation
It's a frantic situation
It's a frantic situation

Extra salty 'cause whoever beat me, got me for this 31-inch
And this Alpha Bailey jacket I had just bought me
Out of snapping, my guy tried to talk me
But what could get me half way calm was this Donny Hathaway song
The tape that it was on I had wanted while I was gone
But forgot to pack it, in fact it was in that jacket
This demo, it's time to track it and lay it down
Either it's somebody I know or somebody I stay around
Day before I broke out, niggas was over my crib getting smoked out
No telling who had the place scoped out
Dot had brought over some niggas I didn't know
I'm asking who are you, they said I'm here with them all
If it was them, soon I'm a collide with them
And they better not be rocking no new Iversons
Then it could have been this hype that usually shovel my snow
If I'm out of town or not, by my car he would know
Now it might have been this stripper I met at Pinkhouse party
Thick, but my furniture wasn't worth her body
What if it was this nigga I let sleep in my crib?
They had a set of keys, but that I wasn't trying to believe
But I couldn't put it past him or those other bastards
It'd be assed backwards for me to ask if they did it
'Cause whoever did ain't gon' admit it
The blunt and dirty disses is my only exhibit
Wondering if I should give it a rest and through the wind it might surface
Cause telling the law, Joe, is worthless

Hey sucka nigga, whoever you are
Hey sucka nigga, whoever you are
Hey sucka nigga, whoever you are

Fuck waiting under my skin, the situation is scraping
Somewhat like the girl X-rating
It's hard to be patient with no VCR or PlayStation
Knowing your Rockports, somebody may be lacing
Make me wanna leave the city when I can't take a vacation
Without somebody breaking in my demonstration
For some South side information, I search the Nigga-net
It's certain things about this I ain't figure yet
Dirt, the guy who stayed with me and had a set of keys
Because his job had been stopped smoking weed
Thursdays his off days, he usually watch his seed
For him to have done it, a babysitter and a car he would need
The stripper broad, my TV and couch she couldn't carry it
Unless some nigga helped and that's who she'll get buried with
She was vegetarian, she wouldn't have cooked chicken
I confronted her with it, to her story she was sticking
The plot thickens, as we drove in search of this 
hype
Who I ain't know by name, but I knew by bike
Chances of him breaking in, chilling and eating
Are about as slim as he is, though I knew where he lived
In this house with three kids, one I was cool with
As we rolled, I told the guy turn on the music
Just as I thought I closed in on one suspect
The nigga who did it popped the tape in the deck

-Just tell me why. Don't lie to me, man, just tell me why!
-It's the money, alright?
-Just tell me why!
-It's the fucking money, alright??

There was a Hardy Boy mystery I was trying to solve
Can't understand who the fuck was involved
Back from a show I had came, hopped off the plane
In my mind home was pictured and rest was the frame
My guy came to grab me in something less than a Caddy
Go buy them gas and food was less than a cabby
As we approach my tilt, paranoia in my bones had built
By the lock on the door, a hole was drilled
I opened it to the kitchen floor my heart knelt
In my shit, somebody had broke in like a mitt
My mind started swinging and who I thought the glove fit
As usual, niggas is suspects
Who did I tell I was going out of town?
Not too many people, I guess the word got around
The people upstairs should have been disturbed by the sound
Must have came in during the day when at work they was found
At the mound I stand vocal pitch high, asking who done it
Fuck Hitchcock
, 
I got the fifth cocked
, 
about to go Wild Hundreds
Whoever did it had the nerve to chill, and get blunted
And left a roach in the ash tray I had cleaned out the last day
Before I left, this thief decided to play chef
Overlooked beef in the fridge to cook chicken breast
I'm kicking what shit was left all around the house
Thinking whoever came in on me is out

It's a frantic situation
It's a frantic situation, yes it is

Are you alone? Is your shorty sleep?
Hold on, that's okay, ignore the beep
For you, my love is immortal deep
You are my queen but I can't ignore the freak
Let's let our bodies talk, and our auras speak
Hold on, gotta get the toiletries
As our waters reach distances unheard of

As the candle burns, when desire's lit
Makin' love knows no distance or environment
When we (ahh!) I feel the most high in it
I feel you touchin' me and I begin to rise from it
Your love is stuck in me
Our minds are so alive and thick
Picture my hands on your waist as I stare in your face
Your mouth half open, your love I can taste
Embracin' you, life I let go
Gotta switch phones, cause this one is ghetto
Another level of love we create when we take it to

Opportunity knocks, I'm lookin' through the peephole
In my daughter’s laugh, I can hear a deep soul
E was my first love, now I'm on the sequel
Heart stay open, in you I keep gold
Crossroads of beast mode to peace mode
Southeast cold, Avalon to Eckersall
Too much on my back to set it off
From the offset, I just wanna be, be, be
Like Cardi or 'Oncé, or Harry Belafonte
Whenever I eat, my peeps get the same entrée

Robbin' in Baskin, our heroes ain't masked men
When I do it, Com' do it with passion
My compassion for brown and black skin
In the hood I used to backspin
Now I'm spinnin' back in the hood
When I'm back, ""Yo, what's good?""
If you stand up, then that's understood
I tell the black sheep, ""Don't react to them wolves""
Crib love, our heroes are on murals
So five Euros get told in their earlobe
That they can let fear go
Souls clear the way, let these palms pirouette

Sweetheart, can you give me another round?
Sweating like you losing pounds
Touch the ground, making sounds
Suga ooh Suga, you wear the crown


All that dancing, Suga
Make me want to do ya
The way you move and shake it
Ah ah, on the dance floor
Wanna touch and feel ya
We can get familiar
The way you move and shake it
Make me want you some more

Ooh, you making my nature rise
We can do more than fantasize
Let's do the do, me and you
We can whoa-oh-whoa and whoopty whoo
Your physique brings out my freak
I like the way your body speaks
I want some of you every day of the week
Suga Suga, you ain't nothing sweet, uh",https://genius.com/Common-sex-4-suga-lyrics
What a World,Universal Mind Control,2008.0,"What do you see when you look at me and I'm just standing there?
Shit that make a robot twerk, that’s what's in my blood
And I won’t stop until I drop, cause my life's just burning out
So I'll keep climbing and won’t look down until I reach the top
What a world, what a world, what a world, what a world
What a world, what a world, what a world, what a world

A little boy from Chicago had dreams to be a star
And make a way and get some pay and drive a fancy car
Though his mama used to say to him, “Aye boy just go school”
But whether it was old or new, in school he broke the rules


Now his whole life he told his boys, “Hey y'all I'm going to rap”
So when he got a rap contract, it wasn't no turning back
Now his mama she would say to him, “You need to get get back in school”
And all the trash that the peoples say, he was using that for fuel


And the story goes on and on, it goes on and on and on
They say, “Hey boy, you rap real good, but you ain't making no hit songs”
So he'd tell him self, ""Yo yo yo, self, you gotta do it the way you do
And make this music from your soul and make it fresh and new""


Then the game it started to change, they say music, it ain't the same
Though he remained, the song he sang is, ""Keep your drive stay in your lane""
Inch by inch the people came, they started to know his name and say, ""Do your thang""
Now the whole whole world singing his song from Chicago a star is born",https://genius.com/Common-what-a-world-lyrics
The Hustle,Electric Circus,2002.0,"Na-na-na na na na na
Ohhhh

My eyes watch God from a place, where times is hard
Hard times we embrace, everybody want a yard
Cause a yard means space
Being broke is odd and leaves an odd taste
In the mouth of the metropolitan, the hustle is hollerin'
Beautiful minds grind, grind for the dollar and
Whether dice scholarin' or white collarin'
We all taught hustle to profit like Solomon
The young play corners, Sean John modelin'
They get it from they momma, black music is fatherin'
Blue and whites flash lights like parliment
In court non-whites, wishin' they had Cocharan
Tell your guy and them, yo the blocks hot again
Aunties walking to liquor stores in moccasains
My guy got a gig, on the side he barberin'
Married a foreign chick so she could get a green card up in the hustle

First to the third, I'm close to the curb
Toast to the bird, now I'm posted to serve
Heard is a verb when you pour dirt on the floor
Bill collecters and the roaches working your nerves
It's a ghetto truck for a ghetto boy
To get in them ghetto streets and get him a ghetto toy
So he can come, so just work, murder rate is increasin'
I don't give a fuck long as my coke is decent
And my rims blind the whole damn precinct
Everytime you see a head in my lap, you know she sinked
I know I'm dead in this trap, that's not how we think
Fifty shells all around on the ground, can't catch a weak blink
Five went through me, two stayed in me
To do my duty, only thing that subdued me
Two weeks, same corner, new freaks
New geese, all white, AND1 new sneaks

The war is on, who you fighting for?

It's like funk to rhythm and punk to rock
Loud like shot that come from a Glock
Pick up your mind, run from the spot
Revolution jumping in the parking lot
Shit is so hot, that the sun watch
Children by the window with the gun cocked
They cooking the raw to start to lump knots
Monkeys dance around for MTV spots
I lock into a- (

Rock into a rhythm of street and ancient wisdom
Experiment in stereo loud

All traces of life, in our guts we carry
That's used to dress humanity (

it's the new wave, dig it!

Clean up the choirs, tell me they shouldn't be
The times are reaching to the end (
it's a new wave, come on!

This life is precious, it's goddamn marvelous
Before it likely ever ends (
come on, come on!

I lay terror in this era like Che Guevera
For the people to make or wait is better
In a room called real, I stay forever
Everyday I lose something, I gain forever
Meditate on how I can change the weather
My brainstorm for some is like planes, umbrella
Where bullets and lies both spray together
My mind scream like Al Green ""Let's Stay Together""
How could a nigga be so scared of change?
That's what you hustle for, for the currency exchange
Y'all rich, we could beef curry in the game
Out your mouth, ain't nobody hurrying my name
You seen what happened when the Com go bang
Wouldn't have a shot, even at a gun range
Seen hype become fame against the grain become main
Stream, it all seems mundane in the scope of thangs

From a land of shit talk, porn stars and pitchforks
Didn't really see white until I went North
Getting bent off in backyards
Wishing in the air for a black god
Where the people fix cars and clap hard
And look to the stars for rap jobs
I walk through the black fog with reflectors on my boots
Smelling war near, I'm connected with the troops
That master anger, it ain't afraid to shoot
Through poured liquor, fallen angels they salute
(Whew! Whew!) Feel the wind blow
A new wave, people with they hair trimmed low
It's two ways living in this world of techno
This new age can't really save the ghetto
I pause for the rebels, who rock heavy metals
And tell them that they pharaoh so let go
Come on!

We dealin wit some very critical and crucial times
Some of the most critical and crucial times I've ever seen
I was on Stoney Island with my guy
He was tryin to tell me about the S-I-E experience
Tried to tell him about the C-S-E experience, you know?
Yo I'm the rap profession, I go the session
Study MC's like a god do lessons
Mic testin in the rain, I brainstorm
You feelin me out nigga? We got the same form
I drop heavy in spots you scared to put your weight
There's only so much ice you can skate on
Shit cats write for you, you say wrong
No time to debate on, who's your pop and who's not
Or who shot Big and 2Pac
Or who this stud fuckin or how much this crew got
That's ho shit
That ain't me or the type of niggas I roll wit
I Cold Get Dumb, like a brother in prison
Who hasn't had a chance to hold his son
Sacrificin like Abe did his oldest son
Tryin to hold my come, I think of raps
Seen the BDP cover and I start thinkin back to

All your homeboys are biters, so what's up wit that?
Your producer pumped the track
Told him, ""Naw, I can't fuck wit that""
Nice way of sayin ""Big, bring a rougher track""
My boy in my ear said ""Enough of that humble rap""
Now every single you drop I'mma double that
Jigga-jigga Joe cut the record down to
My sound surround you like racism, you feel it all around you
I go into a soundproof booth and change flows
Track the strange hoes wit headwraps and Bangles
Hip-hop is gettin strangled by this Puff Combs syndrome
Niggas Been Around The World actin like they never been home

We can go, toe to toe, with the blows to the temple (NOT)
Not the Temple of Doom, so make room
For the Unamerican Caravan (who you down with?)
The B-Boys, Immenslope, Twilite Tone, Derrick and then some
I don't get rid of some faces
While marks be lookin hard, and they be beggin bases
They have too many cases, 
and now they got courage
Sorta like Goldilocks, tryin to take Pop's porridge
But I got, the story straight
Plus the name, I got rep, don't dare sleep
Slept and got, crept
An AC/DC spider went up the wall we mount
Now came down the Common the Common Sense, and now the spider out
(BOOM) A blackout, power failure
I ain't the Burger King, but I got a whale of blows
Uppercuts jabs hits and hey niggas
Cause I'm weird they call me Lemonhead, but I'm a Jawbreaker
And I break a Bean, but I'm not from Boston
I'm stronger, and faster, than Steve Austin
Common'll keep the camera movin -- I'm kinda fast!
I'm from a town called FRESH OFF A NIGGAZ ASS
And I'm about to go on like Stephanie Mills
YOU MUST be poppin pills, tryin to step to me
Cause to the left of me, WE got the U-A-C (whattup)
And comin up to the right of me, WE got the U-A-C (come on)
And in back of me, yo WE got the U-A-C
And in front of me (BAW!) is a dead man G!
We hit em hard!

Kick it
A duck tried to buck, but the vic got vicked
So I picked him, he's another victim of a circumstance
He did a dance like Ali (SAY WHAT?)
But he floated like a waterfly and stung like a C
Ya see, I ain't out here, tryin to be a bully
Nor am I pretendin to be a two-shoes goodie
(WORD IS BOND) that I got big balls homes
And if a player try to press me, I gotta break the zone
Here to stage a, OOH SHIT, up in the sky
You better watch out, I'm tellin you why
Common Sense is breaking, marks down, ah-follow-me-now
Yo Common Sense is breaking, marks down
Uhh, check it, check it, check it
I huff and I puff and I blow (WHAT?)
The motherfuckin house down, I guess you didn't know!
Homeskillet, WHERE YA BEEN? Are you the boy in the plastic bubble?
Ooh you in trouble!
A tisket a tasket, you're gonna get your ass kicked
You better know what's in my jacket, fuck the basket
Oh, God damn CHILD, I mean it's drastic
You end up on a stretched cause I stretch you like Plastikman
Fuck with me (""you end up the in the cas-ket"")
You flow ass pussy nigga, sucker duck bastard

This Grape tried to step to me, with his arms down
Lesson number one - when you're ready to throw
Never step up talkin - that's like tryin to pitch, but you're balkin
And I'mma steal first, not the base, but your face
You can call me Pencil Petey cause the marks I ERASE
In case of emergency, it's urgent see, that you see a doctor
You tried to 
Gamble, but I'm the Proctor
I knock that ass, bringin it down and then slash
Tried to play me with a skit, but now you got a gash
You character, for ya inherit a, neck brace
Makin ya thousand deaths times worser than a Screwface
But they call me Screwneck and I do wreck shit
So next time he push up in the jam, BOY YOU BETTER EXIT

U-A-C in the house
7-D in the house

Blood clot boy, you get bucked, tryin to fuck with the

Mission upon the loves, gettin kisses, and hugs
But then we runnin to a scrub that tried to bug
He's out to get some what they call em stunts because we bunt
(WHAT?) But I don't bug, I just slide her, and hit her
Some be rumpy chump, with the chat chat chitter
Yo we did her but I betcha know I'm better on it
Now you got a 100 percent beef, it's just a beatdown

Brother your best bet, is to cover your eyes, like Dee Brown
(Cause it's a bum bum bum, bum-rush)
And if I ask who popped shit, the Caravan gotta bus
Sing it (""on that defense"")
But our bumrush is well done, not medium rare
It's rare to see, an enemy within play
True indeed a lot of shit, is over he say she say

Just Blaze...
It's love...Common...

I never knew a love, love, a love like this
It's sorta like the love that's played in tennis
Limitless, when intimate friends express it
I talked to the Most, and I know he blessed it
The cadence of destiny, patience, and ecstasy
We can be fresh on the cover of Ebony
But this is somethin' special we ain't tryna exploit
With a couple actresses, now I'm in the tabloids
Like bad boys, real love moves in silence
About out bih'ness, family bih'ness stay private
Don't sweat the small stuff, girl, cause we both giants
I looked into your eye's and I see divine vibrance
The way that Prince, Minnie Rip' and Joni Mitch' described it
A beautiful package, what's even better is inside it
Alive with the feelings that I'm feelin' with you
Forever became real, but even realer with you - it's love

It's love, it's love every time I think about your smile
Anytime I need you by my side, you were there for me
'Cause you are the light that shines
And I want the world to see that you are the light
That shines, you are my life
Love...

It's important we communicate
And watch this relationship illuminate the world
Black pearl in you is a lover and friend
Picture how your name will sound with the last name Lynn
Put a prayer in the air, that it never'll end
And if so, when we come back, it'll be better again
I will be by your side through the smile & laughs
The child we have, even when the clouds is bad
I know your heart had been broken by a love that pass
And when you're not lookin', that's when love can grab
Sometimes you gotta ask, ""Are we movin' too fast?""
Ain't no limit to a love, that's given from above
Mean fish, collard greens, corn bread, you be rockin' it
Similar values, though in many ways we opposite
Attracted to your 'uh', and the way that you be poppin' it
Brighten my life reminded me to stay positive - it's love

It's love, it's love every time I think about your smile
Anytime I need you by my side, you were there for me
'Cause you are the light that shines
And I want the world to see that you are the light
That shines, you are my life
Love...

It's kinda fresh you listen to more than hip-hop
Pop, rock, and Green Day, respectin' what the King say
For me to give a ring, hey, only a queen may
Invites to loved ones, imagine a dream day
Walkin' down the aisles sayin' vows, us eternal
Til thus do us, for now, we stay fertile
Chicka-uh, chicka-uh, chicka-chicka-ta uh
Let's keep creatin', baby, what we makin' is love

Love is like a melody
Looked into her eyes and see
A night that shines as bright as day
All my troubles drift away
The light, the light, the light
(Looked into her eyes and see)
The light, the light, the li-hi-hi-light

It's love, it's love every time I think about your smile
Anytime I need you by my side, you were there for me

And I want the world to see, that you are the light
That shines, you are my life

Put 'em close, let em know...

Somebody hit me with a little, baseline or groove, knahmsayin?
Yeah, breakfast food, UHH!
 When you wish

 Upon a star
 Upon a star
 To follow what?

 And where you are!
 And where you are!
 Party over here, party over there

Look! I made ya look, ya dirty crook
Then picked your pocket, watch me

...like Guinness
 
I'm a Menace, so call me hip-hop's Dennis
So open wide, and say (AHHHHH)
And I'mma slide my yolk, in your throat, and watch ya choke
On the Uh the Ah the Uh the Daddy Long-Stroke

Stroke Long Daddy Money, if my name was Sunny
I'd share a scoop, 
Runnin shit like Rebels
You can call me Barney, cause I took your Fruity Pebbles
Dibble like an office on Top Cat
, top that, I'm fat troop
Drop the loop, then a scooper hoop ya like a hula
To school a fool or be sent a church to repent
I get you Guess'n like jeans, you're just a hill of beans
I'm all that jazz, and I kick, kick, kick, kick..

The razzamatazz oh please oh please just give me just one more blast
I +Gett Off+ like Prince, but I don't have to show my ass
Pass the rest, like a test, if you slip then you'll get ripped
With your handicapped pass rap, and Tales From the Crypt
I whip on that ass like base ba-bay
The Sense is good-GOOBELY-goo, ask Grady

Or Lamont, or Rollo
, down at the, Apollo
Come follow me now (BO! Where's Sue?) I don't know
Even En Vogue, be tellin me ya don't go
When it's time for show (yea) everyone says
Ho (ho) ho (ho) couldn't be a slider
'Cause I never slip, kick it like a Damme Van flip
So don't come with your judo, cause you're just a Menudo
Emcee gettin chewed like vegetables

Ahhhhh cabbage is a cabbage, a lettuce is a lettuce
I'mma tear this whole joint into scraps
I bust raps, perhaps caps, and trap the wack tracks
Givin the max, for the minimum, not the minimum for the max
Get more sex than Wilt the Stilt so you can call me the Stiltest
You're takin shorts like Arnold, so what chu talkin bout, Willis?
 Bout Willis?
 Yeah Willis
 Willis ain't talkin about nuthin!
 It's Different Strokes
 Let's get back to umm, breakfast foods
 because it's, early in the mornin..
 Well you can have your Wheaties
 You can have your Flakes
 You can have your Kix
 And you can have your Trix
 You can have your PANcakes
 You can have your Loops
 But you still gotta get your Two Scoops!

To keep the hot raw, I'm rollin, rollin
Bowlin - spare me! Fuss ya hushed mouth mush
Lush alcohol's excessive 
like a Jefferson
Movin on up
 -- progressive
One time for your brain
, cell
And when I get through, you say -- aww hell man!
Styles that I free won't, stop til the end
Paper I go on and go on with the pen
Get a max of funk, attack or sunk *huff, huff*
One blow, and emcees are gone with the wind
Kickin the dumber rhyme, 
I'm not a prince
But I'm fresh, heatin up like the summertime, summer rhyme
I'm a dime a dozen, but I keep you buzzin
Like a bee, a dozen attempts is in the toilet
'Cause I flush the dime and 
I'm not a Leader
'Cause I Busta Rhyme, a rhyme
If I kick with Rakim, you run for cover brother
But I kick it with Petey cause I'm just another mother (sucker)
Blo Pop time (it's Blo Pop time)
It's Blo Pop time (it's Blo Pop time)
In the mix, the dimension, J.B., and Chico
It's seven, not six, my shirt extra-large
But I wear, I wear, I wear it well like DeBarge
To the finish, makin ya eye pop, like you ain't spinach
Then it's, time to let you know
We count it up, one two three and fo'
 UHH! Count it up
 Nah we gon' count it down
 Nah man, we're gonna count it up
 Mmmm, let's get back to that umm, food tip though, the breakfast tip
 Food tip? Well you just check
 'Cause you know what we need
 What can I have?
 You can have your Life
 You can have your Bran
 You can have your Puffs
 You can have your Pebbles
 You can have your Krunch
 And you can have your Loops
 But you still gotta get your Two Scoops!

Around and round and upside down and upside down we go
WHOAHHHHH! I'mma sneak in the front row
Not Jethro, I'm not a Jethro, on skid row
I don't wear Monie's hat, but I was a Monkey +in the Middle+
Hey diddle diddle, you can Kibble a Bit
I take a squat, and booty MC's be sayin OOOOHHH SHIT!
Yo, I turn Bucktown into Fucktown
You're just a field goal kid, and I'm a touchdown
With the next point to the next joint, so tell Spike about it
I'm all that, that your bitch be writin home about it
Shout it out, praise the Lord, hallelujah!
This could be love, but umm, don't let em fool ya
'Cause when I do ya, come down, come down after me come
Yeah sorry Sugar Plums but umm, I gotta run
Run Jesse Run, keep hope alive
I'm down with the B-boys, FUCK the Jackson 5
You jive-ass turkey, a-pit-apitta-a-aperk be
You can get ill, but don't, HURT ME, HURT ME
Or irk me, cause see I'll outsmart you like the Urkel
B-boys at the school of hard knocks, in a circle
Pass the sess blunt, yeah stud, you ain't know?
I wanna go bang, I said, bang-o, bang-oh bang-oh
Or bojangle, jingle jangle, run the jewel
Hip-hip, hooray, oh now you wanna be a Luvabull?
Don't push or pull, or you'll see, I'mma wreck it out
MC's be checkin in but they don't be checkin out
I leave em out on the canvas

High Expectations,Soul in the Hole  (Original Music From and Inspired by the Motion Picture),UnKnown,"Come on, let's get started.  Don't listen to that street talk.  That street talk is dead.  Don't be talking about no drugs and no popped Uzis around here.  If you ain't got no basketball in your hand and wanna shoot it out, you gotta go somewhere else
 (x2)
I don't expect you to be something you're not
All I expect you to give is all you got

Yo, yo, check it
Unattached and calm, sundaes and pills I palm
With intentions to make it to the league
Intrigued by two-letter cars, SE's and GS'ses
On the court, niggas I leave like messages
Plagued by this ball-player exorcist
It's sort of foul how the world be reffin' us
Kenny is our Moses in this five-on-five Exodus
For the game of life, full courts ain't preppin' us
Schools want me, but the ghost of Manigault haunts me
Plus they wanna crib me, way out in the country
I'm city like street lights and some games that be fights
Never worked on my left so it's hard to be right
Either rich, poor, or Mike is who I wanna be like
Story of many black males that I refuse to rewrite
 (x2)
I don't expect you to be something you're not
All I expect you to give is all you got

Yo, brothers opinions is Bias-ed, like Len
That I'll end up like Ben... Wilson—still, some pretend to be friends
Beneath the grin, I see the jinn spoke of in the Surah
More so than my soul, my jumper is purer
People play juror.  I witness the fall of legends
Once was the joint—now they resin.  Got a God-given present
My gallant talent is like a magic
Trick turned by a chick with a bad habit
Opportunity to move, I grab it
Me and my moms had static.  Now I reek Hennessy and havoc
Man to man talks with Kenny send me to a zone
Been on my own for so long, my vocal tone's grown
Competition gets blown like speakers
When I cross her like Jesus out of bleachers, broads, and beepers
Yeah I boogey it's all good, but it could be better
Want to stay eighteen forever
But now I stay on point like Rod in this Strickland
If Brooklyn courts was a campus, then I would be the big man
 (x2)
I don't expect you to be something you're not
All I expect you to give is all you got

From thoughts that pennies bring, 
I assemble teams like the Kenny Kings
Think fast over breaks, dialect I'm dribbling
Remembering night posters of Moses and the Supreme Court
Realizing that rap and life are team sports
I follow these thoughts
Moves never receive thought, lyrical Johnny Cochran
Cause of the way I free thought
The system make a nigga think to make it that he need sports
Or either to the tip he gotta resort
My seed'll be taught to start his own in the George Carter zone
Don't wanna be a dope MC living in his momma's home
Or speaking to my fans in a starving artist tone
Unknown zones I roam with mind architecture
Spark the lecture, emphasizing: let God direct ya

Doo-doo-doo, mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm..
Doo-doo-d-doo, diggy-doo YO..
I never knew a luh, luh-luh, a love like this
Gotta be somethin for me to write this
Queen, I ain't seen you in a minute
Wrote this letter, and finally decide to send it
Signed sealed delivered for us to grow together
Love has no limit, let's spend it slow forever
I know your heart is weathered by what studs did to you
I ain't gon' assault em cause I probably did it too
Because of you, feelings I handle with care
Some niggas recognize the light but they can't handle the glare
You know I ain't the type to walk around with matchin shirts
If relationship is effort I will match your work
I wanna be the one to make you happiest, it hurts you the most
They say the end is near, it's important that we close..
.. to the most, high
Regardless of what happen on him let's rely
There are times.. when you'll need someone..
I will be by your side..
There is a light, that shines
Special for you, and me..
Yo, yo, check it
It's important, we communicate
And tune the fate of this union, to the right pitch
I never call you my bitch or even my boo
There's so much in a name and so much more in you
Few understand the union of woman and man
And sex and a tingle is where they assume that it land
But that's fly by night for you and the sky I write
For in these cold Chi night's moon, you my light
If heaven had a height, you would be that tall
Ghetto to coffee shop, through you I see that all
Let's stick to understandin' and we won't fall
For better or worst times, I hope to me you call
So I pray everyday more than anything
Friends will stay as we begin to lay
This foundation for a family - love ain't simple
Why can't it be anything worth having you work at annually
Granted we known each other for some time
It don't take a whole day to recognize sunshine
There are times.. when you'll need someone..
I will be by your side, oh darling
There is a light, that shines
Special for you, and me..
Yeah.. yo, yo, check it
It's kinda fresh you listen to more than hip-hop
And I can catch you in the mix from beauty to thrift shop
Plus you ship hop when it's time to, thinkin you fresh
Suggestin beats I should rhyme to
At times when I'm lost I try to find you
You know to give me space when it's time to
My heart's dictionary defines you, it's love and happiness
Truthfully it's hard tryin to practice abstinence
The time we committed love it was real good
Had to be for me to arrive and it still feel good
I know the sex ain't gon' keep you, but as my equal
It's how I must treat you
As my reflection in light I'ma lead you
And whatever's right, I'ma feed you
Digga-da, digga-da, digga-da, digga-digga-da-da
Yo I tell you the rest when I see you, peace
There are times.. when you'll need someone..
I will be by your side..
There is a light, that shines
Special for you, and me..
(I'll) take my chances.. before they pass..
.. pass me by, oh darling..
You need to look at the other side..

(Hiccup!) This is a good place for a stickup
So throw your hands in the air and say hell yeah
I Can Beat Mike Tyson, plus I'm Fresh-er than the Prince of Bel Air
And I Blossom, In Colour is how I'm Living see
Some pretend to be afraid of me but they're my Public Ene-ma
Picture this, like a cinema; I'm winnin a contest
I knew you was a loser when you bought your girl's prom dress
I'm just, another one of the nigs, take a swig
I can sing, brothers'll work it out without a gig
The gold mud in my blood, I'm a stud smokin blunts
Not a fuddy dud if rhymes were pecks, I'd be Woody Wood
They're after pestly hoes and that's the hoes I sex and don't collects
Rockin a Rolex, preferrin sex instead of Soloflex
But I pump skill, to build what I can build and still feel good
The baddest hoes be sayin, ""Oooh you're real good""
Fella a city dweller, it's poison salmonella
Auntie's name is Stella, style as def/deaf as Helen Keller
Nail a flammer with the Hammer for comin incorrect
Not with his grammar or bad mamma jama similar, to Bruce Banner
So don't get me angry, or maybe you won't like me
Kid just in the nick I kick more ass than Bruce Lee's Nike's did
Just in the nick I kick on the geek stick, flick a Bic
Dick a chick, Slick-er than Rick around the clock I tock to the
Tic tac toe, rip up my rhyme my mic's my lasso
Shit, I got rhymes comin out my asshole
I'm in a pole position sole position you're in no position
To be dissin it's a, Rainbow Coalition
I'm kissin ass, goodbye, rockaby, here's your lullaby
Like Georgie Puddin Pie but baby baby don't, cry
Feed em I heat em and eat em if I don't need em then I leave em
As leftovers, packin the weak MC's into ?septober?
Til I was older, I couldn't hold a rhyme folder
Now I dare ya to try and knock this mic off my shoulder
If I'm sober I won't hold a skunk, but when I'm drunk
I might let her bunk in my bed, heads be sayin I'm a hunk
Like a duck I'm slammin ham MC's MC's I'm servin
Makin the people jump like my man... Julius Erving!!!
Those deserving props are gonna get theirs
Grip, there's something on your lip, oh that's my dick hairs
I'm the biggedy biggedy Bear ya scrub Cub with a demo tape
Tryin to catch me catch your breath before you hyperventilate
For air you're gaspin, your best bet is to take an aspirin
I bash it, crash it now you know so stop askin

Hey give it Boogie like the BX, sex regular booger bitches
Get the backseat, G-bumps'll make you buy tapes
Ex-cape the fire tonight, switch like Jekyll and Hyde
And shit, wreckin we live and shit
This swamp water style'll keep em dirty and wet
I bet mills on the rhyme skills, we walk away set
Rich like topsoil, connect coin with currency
Places that I couldn't pronounce, and then bounce
Illegal ain't illegal if it's less than an ounce
Keep it come in T. La Rock amounts, see +It's Yours+
Study scrolls that includes the clause
Get your dirty paws out my bowl, your hustle's too old to deal
With the shuffle, you exhaust me like a muffle
Get zapped and zipped in the duffle
Came to the set splashed, no Roley on the wrist
To Hell with a guest list, we all up in this!
A two dollar somethin got your eyes on him
But yo she pinching my ass so we go, limb for limb
Lights studio dim, it's EXACT tonight
So we can drop the Rap Delight, on one!

Just dance, you know you gots the feelin
Just dance, ah come on and get down
And just dance, you know you gots the feelin

Underground under pressure, my style is the child
Of a lesser, God, I Master like Farad
Persona in between the El Rook'n, and El DeBarge
Metaphorically massage, verbal hajj
I take over breaks and chop loops
Glorifying, one-eighty hat cats can rock in my troops
Wisdom like a tooth, mock new shits I knock loose
Dating game Thursday's I spot juice, Plug like Posdnuos
Before you get a style, let's get a style
My style pans the crowd back and forth
You were soft as the tracks you rappin off, I pop shit
You tried to laugh it off, actin like you had to cough
And didn't hear it, my spirit sustains in the same pattern
Emcee, familiar sample period; spotting where you sampled
Your rhyme scheme from -- I ain't clearin it
I drop science and experiment -- contractually
Came to terms of endearment with my label
Want to pick out a day to smack wack niggas, I contact niggas
Like P.O.'s, you spit background lyrics, I rip Lee flows
Wiping your nose like you need blows
Claiming it's a allergy, I react allergic to cats
Or is it how they word it
If you had weight it must have been some pussy you served with
Thoughts fermented, I rode rhythms and words tinted
Many lip profess, I'm verb centered

Just dance, you know you gots the feelin
Just dance, ah come on and get down
And just dance, you know you gots the feelin
Just dance, ah come on and get down
And just dance, you know you gots the feelin
Just dance, ah come on and get down
And just dance, you know you gots the feelin
Just dance, ah come on and get down
""Just get on down..""

It's like rip y'all, add it on to lip
Wonder Why's upon this, just to flex my strength
I was the one who killed wackness so I had to do a bid
Of twelve years on the mic, before parole with Tommy 'Kid'
Infinite landscaper, green paper maker
Leap far from home with chrome rims and trims
Man these people still taking rappin for a joke
The pimp, I rock it one-double-oh percent
Some of you MC's should be called CM's, Carbon Monoxide
On the mic exposing your polluted bloodtype
Y'all niggas need a visit from the Brain Fairy
Walk around dead, like your physical's buried
Wrote the rhymes durin a earthquake, cause your style's
Shaky as SHIT! Just need to come clean and admit
That yo' quick draw fails the test, and mine was flawless
My DJ gave the scratch, yours was clawless
Your crew couldn't even measure to mine
That's why yo' bitches is busted, and mines is fine
Performing with an upper design, so back on off the plank
We bringin this Big and Bad like Hank

Just dance, you know you gots the feelin
Just dance, ah come on and get down
And just dance, you know you gots the feelin
Just dance, ah come on and get down
And just dance, you know you gots the feelin
Just dance, ah come on and get down

Separate the fake from who the real niggas is
Hot tub time machine back to the Sybaris
Hats from liquor stores to avoid syphilis
Frivolous spending, drunk nights with storybook endings

Writing my own rhymes like I'm Tennessee Williams

We say the facts and if, they lie
We comin' back for them
They might say... but they don't know!
(They say, They say...)
They don't knowwwww

They say a nigga lost his mind
But in the scheme of things I never lost a rhyme
The thin line between love and hatred
I'm the black pill in the Matrix, the saturated life
They say life is what you make it
So I wait quick on a spaceship so I can take it
As high as the stakes get when paper get low
I be tellin Derick, ""Tell Cara get us a show""
Little Com, I make righteous bitches get low
The richest man ain't necessarily the nigga with dough
They say ""You ripped"" ""Wow..."" Yea, that's what they say
My niggas couldn't tell it was me, like Jamie in Ray
Paintin a day, wit focused crime, broads, and good wine
They say ""Dope is sour so it's homework and hood crimes""
I stood mine, for forever and a day so goodbye
They never could say - tell 'em, J


See my life was kinda simple like Nicole and Paris
'Til i started making dollars like I rolled with Paris
Then we went our seperate ways like annulling a marriage
Cause they talk behind my back even worse than the past
Cause while i tried to make it happen they preferred an excuse
And that rubbed me the wrong way like a pervert masseuse
Cause nothing free about juice when you go to the market
So how you using mine just to corner the market
Now I'm more of a target than the items in Target
And matter fact homie I'm tired of talkin'
So if you got them killers what you need to do is send one
Otherwise start calling me Ben cause i been one
Cause 'Quence getting stung ain't in this package deal
So I'm screening all my calls like the actors deal

Tch-a-ch-tchk, c'mere boy, I said it's play-time
It's time to play with the mind of a slimmie
I don't wanna be a freak, but it's the dog in me
I don't pretend to be the open door roses type
I open the door for myself, and I close it right
In your face, now you wanna taste my food, what?
You got your own food, get a attitude
You get left, call the ref if you think it's foul
I ain't tryin to hear that, so have a Coke and a smile
Cause after awhile, I'mma wanna get BUCKwild
And now months laters, I'mma say it ain't my child
I'm sterile girl, we ain't never did nothin
Cause only you and I know that the Common Sense is bluffin
Little Miss Muffett, that's how the ball bounces
Sorry you gotta bounce the ball eight pounds and two ounces
That's how I'm livin, just like a rottweiler
When I was a shorty, I was a lot wilder
But then I got milder,
 and settled down with a harem
And when I can't bear em, I share em
You see it's like no, pass it off, pass pass the puss
I ain't a nerd, but WE'VE GOT BUSH
So cut the bush brat, and let's move it like a U-Haul
Forget the grindin shit, I ain't tryin to get the blueball

I'm a dog -- HERE KITTY KITTY

Zippidy-doo-dah, a zippidy-zippidy-day
Unzip your zipper baby, and come my way
I'm Jack the Ripper, na-nah not Jack Tripper
Cause Three is not Company when your other two friends are thicker
So come one friend, come two friend, come all
United we stand, divide your legs so I can fall
In your bowl of cherries, Kerrie is so very
Thick thicker than the Dick Tom and Harry
Tom and Jerry (WHAT?) A Woody Woodpecker
You need body work, I work that body, I'm a bodywrecker
Intersector, I'm the nectar plus the plum
I manage to take advantage, cause some of these hoes are so dumb
If you got some, just an eensy BIT of game
Then it's safe to say it's that bet you can get a dame
I shoot, aim the same game, yo obedientally
Tell em that I get the drawers come off immediately
Here comes a nut slut, and we can do the Beat Street strut
And be that I'm a mutt -- so what?
No but if's or maybe baby, look who's talkin to
It's true when I'm drunk I might bone anything that's walkin
Down the street, watchin ladies
Nobody's watchin you, because you got a baby
I ain't tryin to be a stepfather so I don't bother
Word to mommy dearest, I look farther
Down the road, to a road not taken
I'm tired of all these same bitches, I need to take care
A new flower, so Joe can take a shower
And get wet, and then jet
Like ahhhh, seven-forty-seven
I tell the girls my number 7-7-7-ninety-three-eleven
Then I'm steppin, so when they call me, you'll hear
""Is Common there?"" Uh-uh, sorry
You got the wrong number, if you wonder I'm the lumberjack
Choppin down the cherry tree and never comin back
It's like that and it'll be like that
Because a dog is a woman's best friend black",https://genius.com/Common-puppy-chow-lyrics
I Got a Right Ta,Electric Circus,2002.0,"Yeah, hah, yeah
We got it, uh-huh

Y'all cats know the abstract nigga with a attitude
Pass the booze and let's build on it
I'm rolling in a Cadillac with the grill fronted
I ain't even smoke no bo but I feel blunted
Yo I'm toking on the freedom, stepping to the AM
Cats is toting in the BM, tell them players I'm the GM
Told my team let me get my plays straight and I'ma feed them
They need me like I need them, you see the streets is bleeding
Had a meeting with my mind on how I can be divine and
Stay on my grind
I'm grinding until I get blue balls
Every day, same shit, new stall
Don't make me act like where I come from cause it's brutal
It's a place that you run from if you neutral
Hustlers in Volks, customers and smoke
I kiss the sky feeling high off the stuff that I wrote
I wanna

Ride in my car, smoke my shit
Keep my head high and let the chrome spin

Keep my head high and let the chrome spin

I'm the only cat in hip hop that can go to a thrift shop
Bring that get up to the ghetto and get props
If you gon' get that kick-a-box, make sure that bitch knock
If you gon' get that Glock, don't be scared to lick shot
Hip-hop is changing, y'all want me to stay the same?
Sort of like Barkley on how I see the game
I recognize game like a scout
Ayo, I'm bound to wreck your lady as I turn your lady out
I ain't about that, messing with no other man's woman
Because of jealousy, then a man go under
Understand, a man and his mental
Listening to Joan Mitchell with the fan in the window
Can it be so simple then?
I rock Rockports, you rock Timberlands
I want a Rover but I'm thinking long range
I ain't switched over, I just made my own lane
Cause Charlie, I wanna

Ride in my car, smoke my shit
Keep my head high and let the chrome spin

I got the right to (feel high) I got the right to (just ride)
I wanna

Like a pimp to a hoe, I connect to the track
I feel it in my neck, and my back
A thug came to me, said it changed his life
Said the love of his life, he used to bang to ""The Light""
I'm trying to do better, I ain't claiming Mr. Right
I'm a grown man, too old to fist-fight
Stay on point like trick dice
You tweaking like a sound man you need to switch mics
Soundin' bitch like, I know the block is hot but we just can't get ice
Want our children's children to sit nice
I sing the song to make the fiend's strong
King Kong ain't got shit on me
I train days to rip emcees
I'm vegan but I still gotta get that cheese
You on some monkey bar damn chimpanzees
Mobbing through Chi-Town so feel the breeze yo
I wanna

Ride in my car, smoke my shit
Keep my head high and let the chrome spin

Pop’s Rap Part 2 / Fatherhood,One Day It’ll All Make Sense,1997.0,"Hey, Hey old been, and you too baby sweets
I'm back in the studio, you know, I drove up
In the parking lot, and the parking lot was empty
Wasn't no cars out there like nobody wasn't even in here
All the doors were locked from the inside
But, I found a window cracked on the first floor so now I'm in here
Let's rap
So, I come in here, talk to my son, you know?
But, but, his next album he got comin' out
You know it's been such a spiritual feelin'
I had to come back in the studio just to see what he was doing
Cause I was gettin' those vibes all in the rocky mountains say, ""I got to go,""
You know? I understand I'm finna' be a grandfather
And I'm so proud
I can say that in many ways, I can say I'm so happy, I'm so proud
You know? Son I wanna give you, you know?
Any direction in parenting at this stage
Because I think it's gonna come to you, just like it came to me
See you came to me and your mom from the spiritual world
We're just the physical parents, you know?
God loaned you to us, as God's spirit
We're the physical parents, you know?
Like I say, I'm not gonna give you no directions, you know?
But, I know when you started teaching me
See we talk about the life and education of one Lonnie Lynn
I think I'm the one that got taught, I do believe that, son, you know?
And I know when you started teaching me too
You know, I was hanging out, mad at the world
My professional basketball career was over
And I didn't believe in the red, white and blue anymore
And I was dissipatin' heavily, I wasn't experimentin', you know?
And one morning you looked across the table at me, it was like ""What? Whatchu' gon' be? Whatchu' gon' do?
You got the responsibility to teach me the right things
You got the responsibility to teach me truth and respect and love, and safety""
You know? And my knees started gettin' a little stronger, you know?
I said, cause I can't get past these eyes man, it's just the eyes of a babe looking at me
And I couldn't look it off, I couldn't even play it off, you know?
And immediately I started gettin' the road maps seein' like how am I gon' do this?
I had to thank The Almighty for the strength, that he sent to me through you
So, I'm here to say, you know, thank you son
I'm here to say I'm so proud and numerous other things
Cause you've been a teacher to me, just like, I have supposed to be a teacher to you
Cause a lot of people think that parenting and raising a child is a one way street
But, you taught me continuous numerous lessons
And I love you my son",https://genius.com/Common-pops-rap-part-2-fatherhood-lyrics

He got a job, used to move rock steady
Windows shaking when the bass drop heavy
Nigga driving like he the black Tom Petty
All fast, extra tint on the glass
Way past the limit when we was past the (?)
(Woop-woop) We heard sirens
Swear I never liked police better than the firemen
Here they come harassing us, off the GP
Maybe cause the car looking like a teepee
Easy easy easy, they approached us
Hand by their holsters, close to their toasters
Us against them man, that's the culture
Try to look sober before they get close to
The window, hoping that the wind blow the smell away
Been through hell today, don't need a felony
Asking my guy for his license
Damn fam, you ain't got a license?
At least for the weed he got a license
They shining the light right through my iris
Got us out the car, put us on the curb
Going through the car looking for the herb
Must've found something because he acting all awry
Found a pound stashed in the laundry
Then they started asking whose was it
Split us up so they can ask more questions
Am I the buyer? Am I the supplier?
Am I rich? Do I have any buyers?
Once they realized that they couldn't move an inch us
That's when they divide and try to Willie Lynch us
Said that my guy said it was my shit
Oh I'mma fall for that (?) shit?
C'mon man I'm from a Chi environment

Smoking Bob Marley but I ain't gonna wail out

In-inhale, in-inhale

I breathe deep like an old man in a deep sleep
Or Indian peace pipe in a tepee
The beginning, the end; the first, the last
Breath into eternity the verse will last
Got a chick in the south that be cursing fast
When it was a drought, I knew the thirst would last
Hunger of a homeless, microphoners
Played the game and got a bonus, man cause the plan is
To master like Tiger, so much drive
I am the definition of a rider
Daughter's name means 'survivor', from a tribe of
Colliders, just one word can't describe her
A scribe of the streets, and a good life that we all want to reach
I'm hotter than a beach
Flow is so deep, even underwater
I can inhale to put the world in order


Gasping for air, and everlast
Still raps that are rare, I write with Christ
Passion to stair-way to Heaven is to stay in step
Breath is deep like my man Johnny Depp
You never know the next one God could have kept
So I find it hard to accept
I came from a gang, now I'm a star with a rep
Just to get-- by, 'cause I was slept on like a red-eye
Like Rastafara, I knew to keep my head high
Blessed by the father, son of the author of life
So rap became my wife
Like love at first sight or  in his first fight

Through the woods, through the 'burbs
Through the mud, through the bricks

Got with four acres and a forest of words
Plant and grown them, for the young seeds to know them
Trees is blowing, we see change in the wind
It's a new day and I got to take it in
See a black man run, we need him to win
Young eyes search, search for a better tomorrow
That belief lead the way and the angels follow
Open doors for the hopeful to go through
Cause I was chose to and I'm supposed to

I know that change gon' come
The race begun
We're almost there, oh yea

I spoke like a child, I wrote like a child
Always smiled, let my mind float like a child
Wishing I was smart as these kids are now
All grown up still wishing I'm child, again
Church song reminded me to stay grateful
Omoye reminded me to stay playful
Days go by, my life on high
I lead on my wall so the fight don't die
In me, I found purpose why I emcee
Inspire a young world to be greater than me
I fall awake and I dream a song
So the little shorties will sing along


Welcome children, welcome me
Your sentiments is felt in me
I see the future and the walk you have
Don't let these fools take you off your path
Laugh if you need to, smile if you need to
Life is a trip, ride along and proceed to
Drive to believe to do what you want to do
Remember your kings and queens are still humble too
Life is in front of you, no need to look back again
Victory can be claimed while you still battling
Travel along with the food I provide you
To awaken the voice that's inside you

No pop, no pop, no pop, no pop
We gon'do this thang till the sky just drop
Lock into ya mind away we rock
In a rocket is the 87 astronaut
Top of the soul, dove and I got in a hole
At the moment they were saying, ""It was outta control""
Strap in to your mind, why eyes see some recline
You'll see in time your season to shine
When the stadium is dark, emcees are defined
Get ready, on your mark, put your feet on the line
The race is on to space beyond
You gon' get there by doing what you want
Sometimes the most famous feel all alone
So we drift to a place that we call our home

I had a dream, a dream since I was a kid

I'm moving, yes I'm moving on, the motor turning over
I met her when I was 10 as I began to grow older
Exposed to the culture, culture that would change me
With the mic check I paint a picture like Banksy
Concrete rose going through hoes and blows
On a paper chase, I found out I was chose
A fetish for clothes, success, and blessing the hood
The struggles of an MC progressing through the good
Music for the 90s, 2000s, and beyond
It started with me wanting niggas to say me could rhyme
And now it's my time, then now it's forever
Change the world, raps and styles getting better
Revolutionize and rising above the game again
My career is fading in, like a DJ on a blend
Women love the voice, brothers dig the lyrics

Behind a mask they wear
Jimi was a rock star
Searching for that magic place
That he could touch in the sky
Just to get his people high

Life is so colorful
Reds, blues and dreams
Jimi lives in a purple haze
In a psychedelic maze
Playing the streets like an instrument
Pulling strings wherever he went
Angel sent from the sky
Just to get his people high

Women all around
Fast cars and sound
And freedom he was bound
Couldn't see the ground
Jimi, come out why don't you set me free? (set me free)

So high, born to fly
Getting high off his own supply
With the most highs of the sky
Everybody follows the same lord
Choosing his light to guide the way
You do, but who do you choose?
Some try things but few die so young
Something among Jimi was stung
Everyone hides their faces
Behind a mask they wear

Sun and the whips kissing our black skin
Strange fruit hanging, smell the jasmine
Rock to Coltrane, listen to jazz then, back then

Redeemer of the people
Songs for the heaple

Do niggas want to eat or are we scavengers?
In the Jeep, two deep, I'm the passenger
Rolling with my guy to pick the package up
His main broad, he kept his stash with her
He trying not to look, she got an ass on her
Got out the truck, blasting BDP
These young bucks wasn't up
They barely heard of me
It's the Ickes where it's murder and debris
The nature of the place
To move birds and trees, the days felt strange (?)
Walked to the courts to watch the games (?)
Dappin' niggas up like Group Home
I'm saying to my man we gotta move on

Let's move
Yeah, we gotta move
Y'all niggas know we gotta move
Cause we paid dues
It's time to make moves

Trucked up ten flights of stairs, yo
Out of air, gasping for air, help
Down pissy hallways, that's their room
I'm saying this bitch better be there yo
Music loud out apartment ten oh four
With her nipples all hard just by open the door
Gave her a hug and said what up though
She said take your shoes off, just mopped the floor
She and D went to the back to handle the stack
Her uncle laid on the couch with a bottle of yak
Talking smack, smelling like crack
In less then a minute I heard a yell in the back
He said where the fuck is my money yo
The bitch came out the room running yo
Her uncle jumped up and reached for his chrome
I'm thinking on him, we might have to move on

We gotta move
Let's move
We gotta move
The state productions gonna move",https://genius.com/Common-lets-move-lyrics

Don’t Come My Way,Whiteboys (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack),UnKnown,"Yeah yeah
You know, Slick, why do he wanna come crib
Acting like he know how the brothers live?
We have to let 'em know
We have to let 'em know
Heeeeere we go
Behold a pair of white horses on the Death Wish course
Been watching MTV, reading articles in The Source
Lost on the other side of the river
Where death approaches the livest nigga
I wonder why this wigga
Would even come around my tilt
With grandmothers cry, uncles get high, and cats get pealed
My guys will deal with him, he got no rhythm
So let the steel hit him, we speaking jail diction
Ho work and day oppression
Turn up the bass and let the system thump
So my neighbors won't hear the sparks as the lead gets pumped
Its a pre-(?) agreement in the cement jungle
Kill each other over money and white boys for fun

Don't come my way
Hawks feel the day
Things don't change, oh no
Don't you come my way
Come my way
See the day, oh no

Little family so a junky living act as
Started smoking crack to fill the void within my black ass
1999, rolling as some broke cat
These white kids asking questions
About where to buy some coke at
Kinda shock a dude, Ruler turn a sucker to
Show 'em where these cats at, maybe earn a rock or two
Retarded, not knowing the kid hardest trife
Kill 'em, asswipes, I'll have a new start in my life
Till the drug lord knock upon their (?)
Disprespected, ""Washed up rapper, what the fuck you want?""
The often asked, I could see others laugh
I got my man he wanna a buy a half a ki off your ass
Scolding 'em, sleeping and sold on 'em
Gimme the cash
Let me flash it through this peephole on 'em (Check it out)
He got hyped quick, pursued in the tight crib
Emptied on their asses, including the white kids

Don't come my way
Hawks feel the day
Things don't change, oh no
Don't you come my way
Come my way
See the day, oh no

Yo, How'd dude go cop a brick when he ain't got the loot
Ricky D, get the heat and 'Treat 'Em Like a Prostitute""
This wigga gots no heart from his Iowa start

And a Section 8 cat, he don't want any part
I put two in there, ruin their, pursuing their souvenir
Nigga, what the fuck is that white behind DOING here?
Won't you say you wanted to slug 'em
""If your not here for the cable or the (?) ya BUGGIN""

Lights flooded the scene, there was blood and si-reens
(sirens)
The cops shot the brother, I still hear him scream
Black mans reality, white mans bad dream
Familiar scene from the Ickeys to the Cabrini-Green
Its pissy hallways, broke elevators always (ya know)
Ain't no place for our children to play
I try to go out in the summer and be feeling the day
These broke and stupid niggas, yo they still in the way

One of the mightiest slang, and plus the night is young
I got long term money draining ideas from
Since they far, I'll find your brown sweetheart
Just being white your like golden goose around these parts
Hey retard, better hurry in, my name is Father Marion
I'll hold that American Express card your carrying
Put your nose up, don't, shut up, provoking and woke up
First where do you live, how much money your folks got?

Don't come my way
Hawks feel the day
Things don't change, oh no
Don't you come my way
Come my way
See the day, oh no
Don't come my way

Things don't change, oh no
Don't you come my way
Come my way

Common Sense will 'em hit where I hit 'em
Common Sense will spin 'em check it out
I guess I did 'em where they should to be done
Ain't nothing new about the wonder rap son
Closed styles like captions yo its time for some action
Man, I get bread, niggas get me sled
When I come up off their head, it was said
For that, yo, it's like this
Common Sense'll strike this, mic this

No stress it can't hear me, a fist full of fury
No dollars no jewelry, a Chicago story
Place that can kill me is one that can cure me
Hard to ignore me 'cuz we livin' loud now
Fire inside me and things that go ""Bow Bow""

""Common Sense in a ghetto in Chicago""

Yo 
Tekzilla
You know I ain't the type to play killa
But this day still arrives in my mind like a flight on down
Thursday night had plans to be out
Till the night served daylight
But it ain't happen
Rappin' to myself cause there wasn't noone to rap to
This feeling came to me like somebody lookin' at you
There was these cats who me and my crew boxed against
Got a, spot and a Glock, now the nigga's got some confidence
Cause I'm Common Sense and I rap consciousness
He was prop to dis mad cause my guy used to knock his bitch
I could sense he was tryin' to bring it
But I wasn't ready to receive it
In fact I made him leave it
Before he could achieve it
As we rolled through the streets of Cottage Grove
And reach the stoplight
Behind me, he flashed lights bright, sorta cop-like
I'm thinkin' 2Pac-like cause he got out the car
I was taught only to fight in defense or the in will of Allah
And ain't no talking when it's time to spar
So before he popped some shit I did ??I act my shit is solo??
Back his lady trying to hold him like big pun
I stowed 'em and told 'em
I ain't a shooter I just punch a lot
Between blows this nig' tried to up his Glock
His brother watched spooked like a daddy on teenage love
He got 'buked til my tape I got sing like a dove
Got his dome into her
My fist brought back the one hand
Tried to pop it musta been a Nas cause the gun jammed
Unplanned I disarm this trick nigga
Pistol-whipped his ass, his lady's I was palmin' it
Hollered 87 reign dominant
Needed a fight that night
Me and my woman had a argument
""I guess I should tell you a little something about myself""
""I bang with the big boys, those who hold game""

Hey now why you gotta hold yo' thang?
Scared to shoot, scared to shoot
Shoot for the revolut-

Them there!    (And you don't stop!)

I'm not tall, but can I bust?
Like the double dutch, going down the street
I rap to myself when there ain't no one to rap to
And to me, yo, my shit be sounding sweet
It's like doo wop, doo wop, oop
I chew with my group, eating chicken and we're couped in a hoop
Deee! Somebody's breath is smelling boo-
Teee! Tone, is that you? (I don't think so)
I'm one time, two times, three times a lady
Bay-beh, bay-beh, bay-bee
Ha! I be making happy, ladi de, ladi da
When I was a boy I said ""Oh"" but now I'm a man saying ""Ah""
Cha cha cha, who knows where the mouth goes
Yeah nigga, I'm fly, so keep your fucking mouth closed
Ralph goes ""Rasheed"" and I be saying ""Boo!""
Bitches welcome back Common with the ""Oooh oooh ooh""

This is how I wreck it, do doo doo do doo
Now one two check it, I'm as Def as a Leppard
It could be, it should be, it is?  Holy cow!
I'm grand slamming slamming like the ?common Billy section?
Not the Godfather, but I lounge like a stepper
Breatha, breaks it, 8, we wait
(Ch ch chaa) I got scratch like a DJ
I used to want to be like, I used to want to be like
Mike, but the man in the mirror don't know if he's black or white
And that makes me mad
(Backwards scratching) Who's bad?

Now can I bust in this era, I'm a plus like addition
And listen, I'm dishing out ish like a chef
The love is the Late Show, showing you the ladies
You late on the show? Oh we the greatest show? You right
To might right, raise, to my left, boom bap
In the back, Blazay Blah, so get the fuck out my face
Oh what a disgrace, you can't disgrace
Boys I'll erase you boys to mincemeat
Human means T, O's, N's, why's this is just a tease before my album
No bum acts out, I'm out to parlay you Fritos
Corn chips off the block, so bust it down, just bust the sound
Exciting as a big zap
I frighten those biting when Lord jabber tighten when tighten taken to loose
Ynot's no loser but I lost your real mind
I find you, finder's keeper's so you mind too
Your mind can't match mine when I do mine
Call mine, my mouth is a fucking gold mine
Bought y'all like monster malls, I get ate like the balls
I got to rhyme, too, I climb you like a stepson
No weapon, but I got a rep, son, for taking fakes to the towel
Snakes in my file
Foul ish, I'll sit down all stand-up comic rappers
Who diss now but don't understand fashion
Fasten your seatbelts til heat melts to ice
T.O.N.Y.'s backwards, nevertheless
I attack nerds, fuck what you heard, hambone
Hey, gone when I finish, women and niggas say ""Damn, Tone""
That's busted

	Common Sense you know is running things
	Late Show you know is running things
	You ain't seeing us though we running things

Usually I'm the second voice, this time I'm the first choice
In the rhyme, I'm no prancer, so what?
Momma mock me, here's your time to jock, G, no jacking
Don't pack no axe like a savage
I ran the track stars back to their crate, create craters
In they ass, I'm holding one for fun
One tht plays golf, can't raise play tennis
Women plays croquet, and Blazay plays the cut
Still make the women say ""Hey""
Yodle lay hey hee hoo, in my way dead
Yo I lay she hoo, in my bed
Ask Common, I did your momma, nah I took it easy
Gave it hard hell, on a scale from 1 to 10
I'm rich, I own a Jet, Ebony, and Essence
And Essence say I'm strong cause with the pen I've been a Bad Boy
A sad boy, I call your girl 13 cause she's good
Should I say more?  I see more, I see more
]From sea shore to sea shore, I sell my yacht and play Yatzee
Ynot's the posse, dressing tight, yo I'm friendly
Who's the master, the weak-minded say I rock too strong
The short-winded say I rhyme to long
So niggas told me, ""Please let me go to the peasants""
No, let me stop, chow, baby

Baby, baby, baby, POP!
Kids call me coffee because I *jugga jugga jugga* drop!
And you don't stop, don't put on the red light

I'm getting bigger than the lips on Martin Lawrence

A Sermon like Erick, did a B.A.P. just like Tists
Well, I'm not Jehovah, but can I get a witness?
I shoot the gift rapping, then wish you a Merry Christmas
With he quickness is how I rip this, can you dig it?
Well if not, then dig this, this is the way the way that I flow
The pimp of hip-hop, I make you say ""Ho!""
I know you hear me knocking, like I said, like I said
And this is the story about a man named Jed
Got some lead for those hefiers, and those heifers yo I rip it out
My weapon, double decker, come from 1, I'm from 87
And I do work undercover like a cop
Stop in the name of Com before I break your arm

Memories on corners with the fo's and the mo's
Walk to the store for the rose, talking straightforward to hoes
Got uncles that smoke, and some put blow up they nose
To cope with the lows, the wind is cold and it blows
In they socks and they soles, niggas holdin' they rolls
Corners leave souls opened and closed, hopin' for mo'
We know where to go, niggas rollin' in droves
They shoot the wrong way, cuz they ain't know and they goes
The streets ain't safe cuz they ain't knowing the code
By the foes I was told, either focus or fold
Got cousins with flows, hope they open some doors
So we can cop clothes and roll in a Rolls
Now I roll in a Olds, with windows that don't roll
Down the roads where cars get broken and stole
These are the stories told by Stony and Cottage Grove
The world is cold, the block is hot as a stove
On the corners
Hook:
(Kanye West)
I wish I could give you this feelin'
I wish I could give this feelin'
On the corners niggas rob or kill
And dyin' just to make a livin', huh?
(Spoken: The Last Poets)
We overstated, we underrated, we educated
The corner was our time when time stood still and
Gators and snakeskins and
Yellow and pink and
Powder blue profiles glorifying them
Verse 2: (Common)
Street lights and deep nights, cats tryin' to eat right
Ridin' no-seat-bikes, with work to feed hypes
So they can get sweet Nike's, they head and they feet right
Desires of street life, cars and weed types
Its hard to breathe nights, days are thief-like
The beasts roam the streets, the police is Greek-like
Game that is deep, we speak and believe hype
Banged in the streets has cop left for deep life (?)
Its steep life, coming up where niggas is sheep-like
Rappers and hoopers, we strive to be like
G's with three strikes, seeds that need light
Cheese and recite, needs and BE strife
The corner, where struggle and greed fight
We write songs about wrong cuz its hard to see right
Look to the sky, hoping it will bleed light
Reality's a bitch, and I heard that she bites
The corner
Hook:
(Kanye West)
I wish I could give you this feelin'
I wish I could give this feelin'
On the corners niggas rob or kill
And dyin' just to make a livin', huh?
(Spoken: The Last Poets)
The corner was our magic, our music, our politics
Fires raised as tribal dances and war cries
Broke out on different corners
Power to the people
Black power
Black is beautiful
Verse 3: (Common)
Black church services, murderers, Arabs serving burgers
As cats with gold permanents, move they bags as herbalists
The dirt isn't just fertile, its people workin' and earnin' this
The curb getters go where the cats flow and the current is
Its so hot that niggas burn to live
The furnace is, whether money movin', the determined live
We talk shit, play lotto, and buy German beers
Its so black packed with action that's affirmative
The corners

I wish I could give you this feelin'
I wish I could give this feelin'
On the corners niggas rob or kill
And dyin' just to make a livin', huh?

In the climate, of locked dreads, corn-rows, torn souls

I'm hard to read like graffiti so it don't phase me
My days be spent, behind dream's tent
Through the sun the divine being is sent
It's the Sun God
{Verse Three}
Letters from prison sayin we need a better religion
I'm a rebel that listens from a eighty-seven position
I can't crystalize the mission lies within
Born to die even in death we begin
It's heavy 'jo learnin what we already know
And carry low swing on a chariot slow
Brothers stick though remindin me of revolution
If the drama comes I'ma have to uhh pop his gun

""AKA Black, Black, Black, Black, Black""
Have they lost they fuckin' mind man?
Know what I mean?...

A bitch nigga with a attitude named Cube
Tried to step to the Com with a feud
What the fuck I look like dissing a whole coast!?
You ain’t made shit dope since AmeriKKKa's Most
Wanted deceased, from the Midwest to the East
On the, dick of the East for your, first release
Your lease is up at the crib, house niggas get evicted
In videos with white boys talkin' you get ""Wicked""
""Natural Born Killa"", nigga you natural born God
Read, rich, got the nerve to say you rob
Hypocrite, I’m fillin' out your death certificate
Slangin' Bean Pies and St. Ides in the same sentence
Shoulda repented, on the 16th of October
Get some beats besides Parliament, to rock over
Rap career is over, better of actin'
What trouble I see, in managing WC and Wack 10?
You backed into a four corner hustla
Lyin' on your dick, said you was fuckin' her
Use higher learning, don't take my words out of 'text
Went from gangsta to Islam, to the dick of Das EFX
It’ll take the nation of millions to hold me back from giving you mouth shots or hit, with the pipe that Ralph got
Chris Tucker ain’t around, it's your Friday, it was good
Wasn’t salty she was with the Boyz N the Hood

I see the BITCH IN YOU, when you don't speak your mind
THE BITCH IN YOU, lookin' me in my eyes lyin'
I see THE BITCH IN YOU, to be hard you tryin’
THE BITCH IN YOU, it's comin' out, check it
I see the BITCH IN YOU, when you don't speak your mind
THE BITCH IN YOU, lookin' me in my eyes lyin'
I see THE BITCH IN YOU, to be hard you tryin'
THE BITCH IN YOU, yeah, check it yo (yeah)

The ump of this rap shit!
Cube I'm callin' out
I break in and smack niggas that's in the Slaughterhouse!
This ain't no East Coast, West Coast, none of the above
I'm from Chi, I went to Cali, niggas gave me love
There's a thin line between, the fake and the real
Grafted ass nigga, I see through you glass shield
HAD SKILLS, once upon a time on this project yo (hop on dudes son, hop)
I'ma have to wreck a HO'Shea
I heard a ho say you favorite rapper...
So I had to slap her!
And violate you, a ""Muslim"" drinkin' brew
Your nigga ain't no Mack 10, he's a 22
I seen you (Mack 10), you ain't say shit in ATL
Cube, I like that diamond charm, I might cuff it then sell-
It out, like you sold Kam and Threat...
A year ago, you wasn't talkin' shit about the West!
Guess you knew your shit was done plus the one got you cable
"" Hoo-Bangin' "", you ain't bangin' shit but the table
And the Circle mad, ain't got no choice but to fight (know what I mean?)
Ain't none of y'all motherfuckers got a chance on the mic! (no wayyss...)
Any time you come out, joe, I'ma talk about you
Until you let that bitch in you, walk up out you
Any last words before I hit the switch?
From the immortal words of one: ""A BITCH IS A BITCH!""

I see the BITCH IN YOU, when you don't speak your mind
THE BITCH IN YOU, lookin' me in my eyes lying
I see THE BITCH IN YOU, to be hard you trying
THE BITCH IN YOU, it's comin' out yo
I see the BITCH IN YOU, when you don't speak your mind
THE BITCH IN YOU, lookin' me in my eyes lying
I see THE BITCH IN YOU, to be hard you trying
THE BITCH IN YOU, chill, check it

Good Morning Love (A COLORS SHOW),UnKnown,2019.0,"It's a test coming to my faith
We pray, oh, my Lord, mmh
Will my people ever be safe?
In the land that takes us and breaks us, I can't be sure

Yeah
Walking with the Lord, I see footprints
My mama always told me use my good sense
Common always looking for the good sense
Since we all got good in our essence
In the hood sense, we all good anyway
That's why you always hear another dollar, 'nother day
I see the day as a new beginning
Movement of the people, movement of the women
To get the Earth spinning in the right direct
This movie of life, sometimes might project
Acts, scenes that don't seem serene
I light palo santo, put on Love Supreme
Get into the being of the great I am
When I get to seeing just how great I am
Many many times from mistakes, I ran
I'm just a cake, let me bake, goddamn
I pray I don't forsake my man
Whenever I fall, on faith, I land
Imperfections, resurrections
In the mirror staring at God's reflection
Reflecting on my aggressions
On my progressions, on my obsessions
There's a lesson in not feeling less
And in seeing life itself as a blessing

When we wash all our pain away
We say, ""Oh, my Lord"" (Yeah)
When we can't make it through the day
We pray, oh, my Lord (Yeah)
It's a test coming to my faith
We pray, oh, my Lord, mmh
Will my people ever be safe?
In the land that takes us and breaks us, I can't be sure

The jubilee of a newer me
Giving my enemies something new to see
My community, they be fueling me
In the struggle of us, there's a unity
The moral universe stay schooling me
Will the king of kings really rule in me?
I'm an instrument, stay in tune with me
This orchestrated by Karriem, Samora, Boom, and me
If agape had a Cupid, she'd be shooting me
This rap here is fear's eulogy
Escape rooms with glasses of wine
Just another crutch for my brokenness
A term that I got from my therapist
As a black man, I feel I should be sharin' this
In the hood, they say we crazy and we derelicts
But we needed for our kids and our marriages
Though some folks say we don't do that
But taking care of self is the new black
Unconventional ways, unconditional ways
Mediation, mindfulness, it's just given to praise
I'm in a phase, all I see is victory
You on that wave, then come and get with me
I only want what's meant for me
And say the things that's sent to me
In penitentiaries, I met the most enlightened
Finding the losses, Heaven's excitement
I write with a force of a kid that wanted to
Be in The Source, but that changed, of course
I maintained the sauce and became a boss
I apologize if I came across
As judgmental, or self-righteous
'Cause in you, I see his likeness

When we wash all our pain away (Yeah)
We say, ""Oh, my Lord"" (Yeah)
When we can't make it through the day
We pray, oh, my Lord (Uh)
It's a test coming to my faith
We pray, oh, my Lord, mmh (Yeah)

It will be ours, it will be ours
One day when the war is won
We will be sure, we will be sure
Oh glory
(Glory, glory) Ohh (Glory, glory)

Hands to the Heavens, no man, no weapon
Formed against, yes glory is destined
Every day women and men become legends
Sins that go against our skin become blessings
The movement is a rhythm to us
Freedom is like religion to us
Justice is juxtapositionin' us
Justice for all just ain't specific enough
One son died, his spirit is revisitin' us
True and livin' livin' in us, resistance is us
That's why Rosa sat on the bus
That's why we walk through Ferguson with our hands up
When it go down we woman and man up
They say, ""Stay down"", and we stand up
Shots, we on the ground, the camera panned up
King pointed to the mountain top and we ran up

One day when the glory comes
It will be ours, it will be ours
One day when the war is won
We will be sure, we will be sure
Oh glory (glory, glory)
Ohh (glory, glory)

Now the war is not over, victory isn't won
But we'll fight on to the finish, and when it's all done
We'll cry glory (glory), oh glory (glory), oh (glory, glory)
We'll cry glory, oh glory, oh (glory, glory)

Selma is now for every man, woman and child
Even Jesus got his crown in front of a crowd
They marched with the torch, we gon' run with it now
Never look back, we done gone hundreds of miles
From dark roads he rose, to become a hero
Facin' the league of justice, his power was the people
Enemy is lethal, a king became regal
Saw the face of Jim Crow under a bald eagle
The biggest weapon is to stay peaceful
We sing, our music is the cuts that we bleed through
Somewhere in the dream we had an epiphany
Now we right the wrongs in history
No one can win the war individually
It takes the wisdom of the elders and young people's energy
Welcome to the story we call victory
The comin' of the Lord, my eyes have seen the glory

One day when the glory comes
It will be ours, it will be ours
One day when the war is won
We will be sure, we will be sure
Oh glory

When I don’t even know their name
Just seen what flick they was in
As the world and the DJ spins
Hittin' Cranberry Blends
Girls in the club with their friends
Lookin' for men
Dancing with each other
And treat by the chance that they love us
Brothas talkin' in my ear like they got tracks
Sistas in my ear talkin' like they got black
Movements for me to move with
Bad breath mixed with music
These good times so let me use it, yo yo


Let the poppas pop and the breakers break
The hustlas hustle and the shakers shake

The aesthetic is ultramagnetic
B-Boys sweat it, Off
With their hats feathered, set it, Off
Raw like footage, with no edit
In the club, at the bar, Broke headed
With my guy who got the block glocked and dreaded
I rap, I'm expected to be cheddared
This chick rockin' a fur like she want to pet it
Better food, somebody should of fed it, the move
Ghetto, get eclectic, mellow but yet festered
Minds molested by music
Good times defuse with buds smoking speakers
Run nose thugs quote their favorite song

To song and dance

The Remedy,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Yo, we all got different things we got to deal with. we always are trying
To put the blame on something else rather than sometimes looking at
Ourselves, recognizing a lot of the stuff that happens...but if we look
Within ourselves, we could prevent a lot of this nonsense. it's about
Relating back to the essence, where it all stems from. i'm-a do my thing
Over this drum, like a native tongue
Verse one
Q-tip:
Do what you will, if you feel that your steeze is real
Complicated with the skills over reel to reel
Brown skin is what I feel, my mind and body's appeal
Is to the no-frill mills, who hear the beats to chill
Constantly, I'm hearing black americans just sneering
Looking for a leader who can fill us up with either
Hitting us up with great emotional chat
About the fact
That the black
Is constantly held back
Like 50 tracks back in a relay race
And the white team's ahead
So let's keep up the pace
And I be needing something
To feed my logical taste
At the end of the race is there a paradise place?
Yo, we can't get involved in what the next man is doing
Material gain we put too much in persuing
Yo duke, I need this dough so we can step to this party
But we can all mardi grati
Minus that shit in our body
What that got to do with that
'cause kid that's the essence
Your physical presence
Embodies every lesson
You can't run the rolls royce if the engine is busted
Can't even life the knife to cut the mustard
What we need to do first
Now listen to this verse
Let's concentrate on our spiritual plate
Recognize your existence in this vast blue space
From a tiny cloud of blood
To the human beings with taste, sight, touch, smell
And sound
Let's deem it profound!
And prioritize this cause it was allah's wish
Allah? I'm god
No I ddon't believe that. that's a mystery
If God is so good why does shit be happening to me?
There's divinity within
Because we come from the divine
A froce that's not seen but you feel it every time
When the wind blows, and the world turns
And the rain drops, and the baby cries
And the bird flies, and the ground quake
And the stars gleam
So many things are eident of it's existence
What we need to do is link it with persistence
Once we recognize that, we can move ahead
Native tongue, common sense yo he's hip-hop bred...
Common:
From the spiritual world my former life has developed
First person I lost close to me was stella
Some of my mellows
Lost their mothers and their brothers
For them I feel empathy
But I ain't pouring out no liquor for no niggas
I pour my heart out when I see dot out on the deck
Knowing two weeks ago he slapped-box with death
I hear of niggas dying in the wind-in the news
But when it's somebody you know it hits you
And emotions get bruised
I ain't been in your shoes
I won't judge you for knocking
Because the spirit of the ghetto says you gotta!
They snatch you again from rock flippin'
Give back into the neighborhood, you better start kickin'
Stickin' stores
On the strip
I'm tired of arabs giving me my change back
Devil bomb my yesterday
My tomorrow he never gave back
I lay back, looking at the ceiling
Wonndering what can I do
So my homie won't have to be dealing
Not cause you serving and I'm rapping I'm better
Just different pieces to the puzzle of black life
That we have to put together, better ourselves
Cause families we gotta raise
No matter how long the money
Shorter become the days
Men become like women
And no difference in the season
If you got popped five times
You breathing for a reason
Let's put the five tenure plan into progression
Before we count our paper
Count our blessings",https://genius.com/Common-the-remedy-lyrics

Memories on corners with the fo's and the mo's
Walk to the store for the rose, talking straightforward to hoes
Got uncles that smoke, and some put blow up they nose
To cope with the lows, the wind is cold and it blows
In they socks and they soles, niggas holdin' they rolls
Corners leave souls opened and closed, hopin' for mo'
We know where to go, niggas rollin' in droves
They shoot the wrong way, cuz they ain't know and they goes
The streets ain't safe cuz they ain't knowing the code
By the foes I was told, either focus or fold
Got cousins with flows, hope they open some doors
So we can cop clothes and roll in a Rolls
Now I roll in a Olds, with windows that don't roll
Down the roads where cars get broken and stole

Street lights and deep nights, cats tryin' to eat right
Ridin' no-seat-bikes, with work to feed hypes

Desires of street life, cars and weed types
Its hard to breathe nights, days are thief-like
The beasts roam the streets, the police is Greek-like
Game that is deep, we speak and believe hype
Banged in the streets has cop left for deep life (?)
Its steep life, coming up where niggas is sheep-like
Rappers and hoopers, we strive to be like
G's with three strikes, seeds that need light

Balance the motions, soft and hard as the oceans

Tim Westwood Freestyle,UnKnown,2019.0,"Yeah, ah, rock

Common, Tim Westwood, right here on Capital XTRA
You should understand the rap texture
They say you grime like Skepta
I let 'em know, I disrespect-uh
A emcee that got it
Get on hot, hot topics
And let you know I go through the tropics, and I rock it
I've been spotted as the one that was alotted to
As the chosen
I came from the land of the frozen
And I know them
Who's the shogun?
Is it Common?
I'm the place that you know
I keep bombing these styles up
Wild up, you could-you could a smile up
Yo, turn your smile up and turn up
You could learn or
Yo, you don't need a burner
I could earn a buck, but I'd never get it stuck
When I came to conduct
Yo, I came to the U.K
I told you Tim, yo, he's the DJ
And in the best hoods, yo, to Westwood
I go to West sides and it's all good
It's all understood where I come from
I told you, yo, my name hung
On them streets, over them beats
I came and let 'em know I was staying at Embassy Suites
Tryna get this deal, it was for real
Yo, I just had to built cause I'm from go-ill
And that was for real
I went to N.Y. and said: ""yo, man I gotta get this job""
They said: ""why""
Yo, I, I looked 'em in the eye and said I'm a emcee
You should never know I'm never been flimsy
With these things and with these dreams
Yo, if you rolling with Com' and Tim, this kings
You should see that
Yo, you can get that bio feedback
Even on your computer, I ain't been a shooter
I just been a executer, with different type of gifts
And this is what I do, they said: ""boy, you uplift""
Why I inspire, get 'em higher, I got the fire
Yo, keep it hot when we cold through the spots
Yo, I should've been at Glastonbury
Yo, they should've asked me different, very, various styles, I got it
And let you know when it came down, I came to rock it
Yo, this ain't that boy from Houston
This the boy from the Chi, yo
Real rap rhythms, real rap wisdom
When it come down to this, yo, I got -isms
I got them -isms that go down
And this is how I hold down
Down with my man Dilla, he's from Motown, rest in peace
Yo, I got the beats and I take it to the streets
Shoutout to the East, and South part of London
I'ma keep comin' with these styles and you know who I hung with
That was my boy Tim, we was back in the days
Going through that maze, sort of like Frankie Beverly
Yo, who can better me? this is how I do forever see
And this boy Com', yo, I'm finding forever free
Free the mind and see the rhyme
And we design, these things and see in time
That I'ma keep climbing mountains, I've been doing it
Pursuing it, I've been on this music tip for a second
You like: ""man, come through""
We seen you kick ass in John Wick 2
I should've been in 3 but, I emcee
So I just came and let you know I had to do it free
When I came to Capital, yo, I guess rap I'm rapping too
Let you know this ain't casual, I'm asking you
If I need it, then I just proceed with
These types of styles that I make emcees bleed with
A little bit of 'em, a little bit of gems
A little bit of 'dems, yeah, a little bit of rims
They used to roll around, hold it down, in my town
But that's how it is when we roll in Chi-Town
That's where I told you, that's when I hold you
Get your gold tooths and let it shine, boy
Yo, I came to climb, boy
Listen to the rhyme that I design, boy
I find joy in it, when I come down, I stay on Bennett
I was the tenant that buzzed there
I housed those who know- that- run there
Tried to run there- fun yeah",https://genius.com/Common-tim-westwood-freestyle-lyrics

Now you got to tell me right now is you man or meese?
Is it man or beast cause I plan to release
The rent essentials what's my name, confidential
Na nah don't tell a soul but I sold my credentials
Skipper off my team, everybody Top Gun
Fortify the army, you can't beat us with a pop gun
I stop one allowed with one thought on my mind
Number ten is a hero take that one and make him zero
That's law, word to Shapiro, Infinite's a colonel
Now put that in your journal better yet in your eternal
We heavy like a sledgehammer, with Know the Ledge grammar
A bad mamma jamma all the way to Alabama
Chi-Town, where we don't fight over coasts

Didn't grow up ghetto where I'm tryin to get to is the same as you
I ain't a player, but I'm in the game with you
It's people in my city, that's just as lame as you
Laid the framework now at the door my name work
Free drinks attention paid, that's how the game work
My flow became land, with mathematics
I reign supreme like the Rainman
Piss in unknown spots, givin dap with the same hand
Raps overlaps and fill gaps in the rap industry
For those whose tired of the same similies
Hood stories, and songs to homies in penetentiaries
Chances I take over breaks, to make shit interesting
My city'll hold it down like bends in intersections
Wanted to say Fuck the Police, I ain't had no protection
Got the License to Ill, the real one got suspended in time
Brother you'll see it ain't all about the promo

Computer program the ill chatter
Brain stimulize sparks everytime I reply

Ninety-seven time to rock it, grown man status
I'm pushin three-zero, I plan to be the baddest
Like hip-hop hero in the game MC
And makin sure that what you seein opens up your mind
When I kick the hard to find, strategic, rhyme design
Supersede your average line, intertwine when I combine
Elevatin mankind, attract a scholar
I convert poetry to dollars, a risk taker
Money maker got no collar, this one nigga asked me
Well who you be? I be a store ownin real-estate flippin MC
Just makin beats on the side
Another way to survive, I turn around artists
Portfolio diversified, it's obvious
I ain't your average hip-hopper
To get up on the microphone and can't come proper
I be the MC to keep the clubs cold jumpin

Down, da, down, check it, check it
There was a Hardy boy mystery I was tryin' to solve
Can't understand who the fuck was involved
Back from a show, I had came, hopped off the plane
In my mind, home was pictured and rest was the frame
My God came and grabbed in something less than a Caddy
Go buy them gas and food, was less than a cabby
As we approach my tilt, paranoia in my bones had built
By the lock on the door, a hole was drilled
I opened it to the kitchen floor, my heart nailed
In my shit, somebody had broke in like a mitt
My mind started swingin' and who I thought the glove fit
As usual, niggas is suspects
Who did I tell I was going out of town?
Not too many people, I guess the word got around
The people upstairs should have been disturbed by the sound
Must have came during the day when at work, they was found
At the mount, I stand folded than tie askin' who done it
Fuck Hitchcock, I got the fifth cocked, about to go wild hunted
Whoever did it had the nerve to chill and get blunted
And left a roach in the ashtray, I had cleaned out the last day
Before I left, this thief decided to play chef
With the beef in the fridge to cook chicken breast
I'm kickin' what shit was left all around the house
Thinkin' whoever came in on me is out
It's a frantic situation, it's a frantic situation, yes, it is

Remember when we used to watch nick at nite
Saying everything was gonna be alright
But then you started selling rocks and smoke at night
Man
Let me feel alive for a minute
Go back a few years, then my world starts spinning
We never went to church, so i had no limits
Tryna make the best of me with what i was given
I was so alone in my room
Wishing help was on it's way soon
Baby
I was five feet below
I was underneath the water
Underneath the undertow
The days start skipping now
How ya living?
Tryna find my way, tryna learn to start forgiving
Every other day, a day that i was missing
Every night alone, it's only useless wishes

How'd you really get that life

How'd you really get that life

Everything you taught me
Everything you wanted
Everything you did without me
Everything you said
Stuck in my memory, even though its faded
I still see it cleverly
If you do it right the first time you won't get it wrong
You're my only son, ima sing it like a song
You will grow up and be humble
Always take care of your mom
If you're feeling down
Always stay strong
I don't really know what i'm doing
Passing time, living in the music baby
I've been here for a minute
Tryna live my life but there is no winning
Tired of being lonely and i feel like quitting
Your life is a gift, but life isn't perfect
Life isn't gifted, life can be surfaced
When we get together
(We can get through this)
We can get through this
