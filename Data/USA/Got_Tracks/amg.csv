I wanna get ya butt booty naked can I wreck it baby?
(HEY!)
I wanna see your big booty naked can I wreck it baby?
(HEY!)

Well I'm a big booty sticker
Honey dip licker
Baby you can try me if you want to trick a
I'ma do her from the backside and drive ya nuts
Spank you on the fanny while I'm digging out ya guts

They call me Mo Bee I bend ya over if ya lonely
I'm AMG and I'll be ya homie if ya bone me
I'm an expert
I'll make your body jerk
And if ya wanna flirt
I'll put that ass to work

I'ma lay you on a mattress like a bedspread
And if it's that time of the month, baby use your head
A touchdown, a home run, another point scored
You might need some Tylenol from your head hitting the headboard

I'ma hit the hootie mack and hit the bootie crack
And if you want the big bootie smack, grab my nut sack

Yelling out ""Flexzure"", now you got the feeling
Yo G this is Soul Train, I'm Don you Cornelius


I'm the big ding dong
King Kong
If you wanna bring your friend along, baby it's on
We can have a three company and while you're humping me
I'm a lone licker like porno flick

Well I'm Flexzure I wanna sex y'all
Bump, hit the skins step back and let the coochie jump
Like a gang of brew when I'm like banging you
Have you screaming silly sounds and saying ""oooooh""

If it's tight I'm right, if it ain't I can't
I'ma go up in ya till faint
Or until my nuts ache
Your legs in the air, booty everywhere
Call me Mr. Dairy Air cause right now I'm in there

I be the pop wow, yippy I aye
With the rudest set, honey dip crack your legs
And be ready for the big backstroke
When the big jim pokes, wicked on the bed Pee ain't no joke


I'm the freaky
Deaky
Brother when you see me
Be ready to drop your drawers baby when you meet me
Wreck the panty poom poom
We gonna use the whole room
Pee Wee Flex  makes the booty poom

And all I wanna do is zomma zoom zoom zoom
And get ya butt naked in a hotel room
I like ya style
I'm making money by the pile
I make ya smile
I can stay a little while

Baby you and I can catch a thrill
From the man with the big diznill
""Poon"" is my nickname, game for a dame
I'm a freak in the sheets, Flexzure has no shame

Now in the bubble bath I make ya laugh
Baby with the champagne I got booty on the brain
So catch me like a lover not another
I lick ya from ya toes to ya dome

Around the World,Ballin’ Outta Control,1995,"Hi daddy, it's Nicole
When are you coming home?
I miss you baby
I hope you're havin some nice fun

I been around the world (what?) and it's A Million Girls (true)
I been around the world (what?) and it's A Million Girls (true)
I been around the world (what?) and it's A Million Girls (true)
I been around the world (what?) and it's A Million Girls
A Million Girls

Yo it's funny, hoes wanna give you they heart
When your jam's at the top of the charts
But you can't play me like a game of spades
Cause the A.M. is afraid of babes
I seen many come and I seen 'em go
I came with a few and released my flow
I'm back, but without the booties I'm chillin
I used to get that feelin I'm stackin A Million
Now baby, I'm used to the hoes and tramps
Livin in the home of the one night stand
Jump in the ride, then I'm dickin you down
You couldn't tell me nothin, I was more than a hound
Redbones and jiggable pies, big booties in the thighs
Long haired freaks with pretty eyes
I was on the road, ballin' outta control
Pockets on swoll, then I lost my soul
Now give me that joint to hit
Every girl was a bitch and a bitch ain't shit
The world was a pussy and it's all for my dick
I had it goin on, then I started to slip, why?


It used to be a three-oh-fo' thing, a big ol' hoe thing
State to state, fly hoes to mate
Up under the covers, lover lovers with rubbers
If they knew my name, then they knew my fame
And the game was tough, didn't know who to trust
Love wasn't a must, just a cutie to bust
And it got kinda lonely, cause they really didn't know me
But they knew I was the one and only, and
What goes up, must come down
And when it came down, nobody was around
The freaks and the fleas and the G's was gone
No crew, no boo, so I sing this song and uh
I gotta get back on track
Cause a nigga didn't know how to act
Livin in the fastlane makes you go a little
Insane in the brain, but it's all the same


Nowadays, I'm lookin for the one love shot
Not with me cause of what I got, or what they think I got
Cause some ladies wanna choose and abuse
But I ain't gettin used, like them other fools
Buyin cars and, treat 'em like movie stars
Baby do you even know who you are?
You can't step to the A.M., and think you gon' play him
I ain't sayin no names, but I probably should say 'em
And a lot of y'all probably can't handle this
Cause you don't think y'all act scandalous
And you never been checked like this
So when I'm gone, baby you can reminisce
But really though, you're just a silly hoe
And you gots no shame, and you to blame
But you're young, and you're full of cum
And they say, ""Go on girl""
But bitch I been around the world
I been around the world..
I been around the world..

I been around the world..",https://genius.com/Amg-around-the-world-lyrics

One time for you mind
Uh, uhh, uhh
Youse a.. sucka..
Yeah, yes
I once met a nigga who was cool and shit
So what?  So I let him hang with my click
Said he pimped hoes, and he knew how to make ends
Said he even had a Benz
And a house in Atlanta, G-A, and in L.A
And he fucked different hoes every day-ah
I said, ""Nigga since we all in the same game
Might as well let our motherfuckin nuts hang""
But shit got funny when it came down to makin money
Found out he was a dummy
And the pussy made him sway
And it wasn't no different hoe each and every day
But trip, that ain't it, he went out like a bitch
Sayin my shit was his shit (nah)
Now he's on the way to player's court
Gettin charged for fakin the funk
You little punk, youse a sucka

Nigga, youse a sucka for love
Nigga youse a sucka for love (nigga youse a sucka)

Nigga youse a sucka for love..

I got a homey who calls me a captain
Cause I get a lot of hoes from the rappin
But I ain't no trick, I'm into hoe hoppin
But guess who I see in the mall shoppin?
Diggin way down deep in them Kani sweats
Spendin dough on a hoe that he ain't bumped yet
And he don't wanna see me, but I make it known
Cause the hoe that he with I already boned
And the bitch actin like she don't know a brother
And this nigga holdin on to her like he love her
I looked him dead in the face and said, ""Whassup Trace?
(Nigga) Ask you girl how my dick taste""
And he wanted to fight, talkin bout I ain't right
(Nigga please) Nigga flyin like a kite
Now he got two babies by her and he still
Callin me a liar, she's his wife and he's a sucka for life

Nigga, youse a sucka for love
Nigga youse a sucka for love (nigga youse a sucka for life)

Nigga, youse a sucka for love (and y'all hoes out there..)
Nigga youse a sucka for love..

Now in ninety-fo', hoes gettin lucky
Like a four leaf clover, but I'm still a Rover (woof)
And it's kinda strange, when you see 'em rollin in the Range
With a coach bag full of cash
Wearin Donna Karan but I ain't sharin my money witcha freak
You can call me cheap
Or you can call me crazy, whatcha gonna do
When your ass get fat and lazy, house full of babies
And don't blame it on your baby's daddy (uh uhh)
Cause you let him buy ya, then you let him try ya
And when he left you was broker than a joke (uh uhh)
Lookin for another, so you can pucker
Up your lips, and kiss him on the thang thang
Whip it on him real good, and it's the same game
So who you tryin to fool and clown

Somethin for ya to.. ride to
So uhh, let it bump in the trunk cause

It's all to the good
When you're bumpin in the leather and wood
It's all to the good
When you're bumpin in the leather and wood

I jumps in the Lex-o, on the way to L.A
Had a payday, now I need a boo-tay
Too many freaks rollin with they top down
I'm a hound, so I clown and turn up my sound
Light a beadie up, see a hoe I wanna know
So I speed it up, hope she eat it up
Too quick on my dick, then she jumped in
Star struck little hooker with a rump
Lookin like a melon
She knows I get paid for sellin my spellin
I'm tellin ya, 17 was the age of the P-Y-T
Hey you need to ride with me
She said as my head shook no
Park the bucket you tramp and don't slam my do'
As she got in, all I had to say was
Damn Cube, today +was+ a good day


Had a early booty call about 10:30
Got the eight-five-oh, cause the Lex' is dirty
Had to go and get the hooker from the Wood
No drama, cause it used to be my hood
Hit the horn for the hoodrat to come out (c'mon)
Long hair, redboned booty no doubt
She's the freak of the week, that's what my homies say
Thinkin I'm a trick and a treat, like a holiday
But I gots better plans for mine (what?)
I ain't even tryin to pass the time
Took the hoe to the beach y'know
Got her high off the bomb ass indo
And the bitch got naked in the B-M
Then I rocked that ass, like a coliseum
And that's how it goes you know
When you fuck with the three to the oh and fo'
Cause it's


Check this out, yeah
Feelin grand in the blue Cherokee
Sippin on a little Coke and Hennessey
Pager blowin up and lookin like the voicemail
Tenderoni wanna meet me at the hotel
On the way to the spot, I see Poppa LQ
And Girbaud, with a car full of hoes
And they want me to stop, but I cain't cause
I'm on my way to see E, to get the bombudd
Get the smoke then I'm headed down Pico
Bust a right on the way, to the Nico
Lookin fly in Kani walkin through the lobby
Bout to go to the suite and hit my favorite hobby
As I walked in the door to get the booty Hobbes
She fell down to her knees and gave me props
And she's lookin like a queen to me
Got a number two fiend for the jeep to creep

304 Thang,Ballin’ Outta Control,1995,"It's a 304 thing
Let me see your body swing... swaaaang
Let me see your body move
Don't just sit there get your groove on
It's a 304 thing

Pagenet Nationwide on my side
Never miss a beep from a freak with a big behind
Who wanna bump and grind with the bigga nigga?
I need a hooker who's quick to lick a dicka
Take a sip of liquor, Hennessy and Dom Pérignon
Gettin' high with the bone
Lookin' for the late night hype
Player haters huggin' on they hoes so tight
Trick of the Month, trickin' on a stunt
Thinkin' you's the mack 'cause your pockets on fat
I'm the reel-to-reel, got the steel to deal
And, put my fist to your grill and will (damn!)
Take your hoe to the honeycomb hideout
Give her this mighty love, then I slide out
I'm the wham-bam thank ya m'am king of the underground swing
Baby it's a 304 thing

It's a 304 thing
Let me see your body swing... swaaaang
Let me see your body move
Don't just sit there get your groove on
It's a 304 thing

I'm just a nigga from the motherfuckin' what?
Used to make ends with the birds and the bud
Before I made a demo, before I rode a limo
They used to call me Spend, paper to the pen
Beats to the tape, sittin' in the studio
Niggas try to act it, but they never knew me though
Just me and mo' doe, never in a four-do'
He me low keyin', Cherokee'n
Now it's '94 and, A-M' is the name
Fuckin' up the game, steppin' on the lames
Niggas wanna gangbang but I wanna make ends
Fuck a '6-4 put me in a Benz
With a redbone bad mamma jamma
With the thumps and the bump like my nigga Hammer
And it's real good, comin' with the California feel good slang
Cause nigga it's a 304 thing

Let me see your body swing... swaaaang
Let me see your body move
Don't just sit there get your groove on
It's a 304 thing

Nigga who is you? Guess ya don't know about my crew
Will put you in a twist and they don't miss
Too many to name, but they don't want fame
Just a piece of the game
And some wanna get high but I gets fly
From the Coast with the most to the best thigh
And I can't forget Chicago and Frisco
Houston where the Geto Boys is thick yo
Atlanta, GA where the players play now
One more gen for my niggas that locked down
And all the rap superstars and they crews
You better get yours, before they get you
And to the ladies, I don't hate ya but I love ya
But a few of y'all, oh yes I'm through with y'all
So if ya like what ya hear let me here ya say HO!

Pimp of the Century,Ballin’ Outta Control,1995,"With the mad funk..

AMG, on the go
Back on the motherfuckin microphone
It's the pimp of the century
So bitch pour the Hennessey!

(Aowwww) I got a new bone to pick
And hoes, I got a big bone to lick
And niggas been ridin my dick, like an Amtrak
Niggas thought I fell the fuck off, but the G's back
The dog from around the way
Uhh (L.A., Cal-i-for-ni-a)
And baby I bust 'em in
Hoodrats hoes can't even just ride the dick
And niggas been houndin me
I'll be out, they surroundin me
But never is they clownin me
And this ain't ""Bangin on Wax""
But let me get straight to the facts
I ain't no blood or crip
But I got a Glock 23 with a couple of clips
And gold diggin hoes get the 22
(Buzzin) buzzin and you bug my crew


(Aowwww) I used to drink Olde E, now I sip Moet
Hangin with the jet set
And the hoes know my records sell (records sell)
So they all eat a dick up well
From state to state, they can't wait
For me to rock a show, then I'ma knock your hoe
Countin dates in my gated estate
(Ya fool) I got your girl naked in the pool
(Aowwww, hittin that indo) What?
(She just called her friends so)
So we can have a big Three's Company
Two big booties in front of me
Put my rubber on, before we get to humpin
Hit it from the back, like she stole somethin
Bust a big nut, then I'm snorin
Cause when the hoes get to talkin, they borin
And it's a shame, niggas fallin for the okeydoke
The whip appeal is a joke
And like I said, I'll be your personal 304
When I'm done, hit the do'


(Aowwww) I'm just a player on the run, havin fun
In the California sun, hit me one
And the leather and wood, I got my boys in the hood
And they ain't slippin while they grip trippin
Bumpin hoes and, baby if you're fly you're gettin chosen
I scoop a freak like you're frozen
And I like 'em when they got a little game
No drama, just a fly little hot momma
Ready and willin, big booty for the killin
(What what?) But don't be catchin no feelings
Cause a hoe is still a hoe, and I can't be witcha
If 20 niggas done hit ya, bitch
I got the 4-1-1, on your hoochie cootchie
Just a groupie, thinkin you can soup me
But you gotta be more than a trick tramp big booty hoe
To fade this nigga though",https://genius.com/Amg-pimp-of-the-century-lyrics

You got a C-note, ho, you can take the test
And bring big fat titties and lots of back
You got the woody, and I got the axe
I'm no joke when I stroke for a client;
Bitches need dick, so they buying it

Open up your Coach bag, bitch, so I can get paid
And take off your G-string drawers
Bitch eat your Wheaties, cause I don't pause

I ain't a prostitute, but I'll knock the boots;
Women love me, they say I'm so cute
Girls wanna get with me, I'm tender;
A big old butt, and a smile and I'm wit'em

Packs 'em out like a shotgun
Licks my johnson, so much satisfaction
She gives me tonsil action
Without asssskin, she does what others won't do
Yo, she keeps the residue
And if I ask her to do it again she says ""when?""
With goo gums and nut drippin down her chin
Baby baby come and suck it up (Ahhh shit)

Then I seen her motherfuckin lip twitch again
I thought it was me, like BBD
I counted to three, then the bitch freaked
Was I to... A, run
B, stay and trip
C, smoke a philly
Or D, shoot the bitch
Gat was in place, finger was inching
Fully loaded, dick was still twitching
Wanted to run, so I dropped my gun

And when I’m rollin’ in my ride kinda high
Females be on my tail because I’m so fly
Eyes are open, checking the scenery
When on Cloud 9, no one can get with me
I can go 10 different places at one time
I can jump in my ear and walk through my mind
Psychedelic P-Funk for the buddha heads
Light it up, little nigga, go ahead
And if you see a big gat, pick it up
Tits draggin’ ass O.G., stick ‘em up
And if you have a vertical joyride within reach
Do the right thing, eat the peach
So hit the thai, stick and listen to this
It’ll have you buggin’ like you wish you wasn’t
I’m AMG, the host of the most if you’re high
I’ll be your tour guide on this vertical joyride

Yeah, got a big ass sack, sounds bumpin’, coolin’ out
Check this

Now hoes, I love you without your clothes
When you’re puttin’ ‘em on, I wanna see you gone
Because my dick don’t eyes, I know you’re mesmerized by the size
So eat ‘em up like a burger and fries
‘Cause you’re a hoe, a tramp, a slut, and you suck dick
Giving up the lips in between your hips
You want me? A nigga with dick for days
Cash that pays, and hoes with big ass that sways
And I’m looking for a new Janine
To be my one and only dick fiend
PHAT—Pussy, Hips, Ass, and Titties
And I’ve got much big dick for the nitty gritty
I may swing and sing, jam like Teddy does
Some say you was a sucka nigga—no, never was
AMG, inhale deep so you can get a little high
On the Vertical Joyride

Yeah, shit is fuckin’ me up

Tha Booty Up,Bitch Betta Have My Money,1991,"Check it out…

If you’ve got big ol’ booty
This new dance’ll be real groovy
(Shake it baby, don’t you break it
It took your mama 9 months to make it)
Bring me that big derriere
The one who’s got all that fake hair
And then we’ll see who can do this right
Y’all step back ‘cause I can do this all night

The booty up, tha booty up
Who can do the booty up?
The booty up, tha booty up
You can do the booty up
The booty up, tha booty up
Who can do the booty up?
The booty up, tha booty up
You can do the booty up

Way way way past O-eight-double-O
I’ll do the booty up 'til 10 o'clock tomorrow
But I need a booty that’s big and round
Just like the bass comin’ out my sounds, yo
Skip all the rigmorale
When I’m at a show, no bougie or hoes
Big butt girls are gonna clap for me
(When I stick out my booty, and mack to the freaks)
It’s better than a brand new exercise
Don’t close your eyes ‘cause you’ll get a surprise
Somebody mighta ate too much of a burrito
And then broke wind, again and again
Because a brotha like G don’t pass no gas
When you do the booty up you gotta watch your ass
Because united we stand, divided we dance
And if you got a lotta booty in your pants, then you gotta do…

The booty up, tha booty up
Who can do the booty up?
The booty up, tha booty up
You can do the booty up
The booty up, tha booty up
Who can do the booty up?
The booty up, tha booty up
You can do the booty up

Ha, my fellow booty up brothas and sistas, ha
I want y’all to get out on the floor
And we gon’ commence to do the booty up
We’re gonna do it on the count of one
No, we’re gonna do it when we wanna do it, ha
Come on y’all and let’s do the booty up

You can do the booty up doggystyle
And remember never trust a big butt and a smile
Take it from a man who studied Bootyology
I can Monopoly and still do it properly
Everywhere I go, and everywhere I turn
I say the booty up, and people wanna learn
But I just laugh and say I gotta go
(‘Cause I gotta rest my booty ‘cause it’s kinda sore)

The booty up, tha booty up
Who can do the booty up?
The booty up, tha booty up
You can do the booty up
The booty up, tha booty up
Who can do the booty up?
The booty up, tha booty up
You can do the booty up",https://genius.com/Amg-tha-booty-up-lyrics

Yo, licking my dick is a specialty
To a girl named Janine—oh, what a dick fiend
She likes to suck and suck but no stickin’
Break out my dick, and it’s like finger-lickin’
Of my bone right down to the base of it
She just blows it when I ask her to Stuffit
Down in her throat, and if she choke
That’s her business—nut in her mouth until I’m finished
Yo, ‘cause I came to cum, brush your teeth
Here’s a stick of gum—do you want some?
Hurry up and lick your lips, clean your throat
Pull down the zipper, here we go
Not too hard, not too soft
Brace yourself, yo, ‘cause you might cough
‘Cause my dick ain’t nothin’ nice
And when I’m done, put your lips on ice, ‘cause…

You can ask my main man T-Money
She do the shit free, no money
‘Cause when I got first done by the bitch
I pulled out my dick and her lips started to twitch
Then I thought to myself, ‘I got a live one’
No jive, I had to go and slide some
Some of this big ol’ black beef
In between the teeth of a dirty old cum thief
But she ain’t old, she kinda young
Kinda sprung, on a dick that’s kinda hung
That’s me, the dick holder, the money folder
Last year, I woulda sold you a boulder
But this year it’s all about 12 inches
For the radio and the bitches
And no matter how many records I sell
I still go to the hoe that’ll serve me well, ‘cause…

Janine… (""She swallowed every inch of it down"")
Janine… (""She swallowed every inch of it down"")
Janine’s a dick fiend (""She swallowed every inch of it down"")

Givva Dogga Bone,Bitch Betta Have My Money,1991,"All the hoes in the say “me” if you’re down with AMG
All the niggas in the house say “ho” ‘cause, yo, here we go

Shazam, the G is who I am
I like girls with long hair and big derrieres
Some people try to label me a nut, but hey
You are what you bust
‘Cause every time I see a freak I think I wanna freak her
Like every time I see a mic, I’m looking for the speaker
But that’s another story to tell
And right about now I got records to sell
And bitches wanna give me the pussy like it ain’t nothin’
And I’ll be huffin’ and puffin’ while I’m steady stuffin’
Dick into their mouth, into their coochie or their anus
Niggas are dogs—hey, can you play with us?
And after I fuck, yo, I don’t know ya
Respect you not as soon as the panties drop
‘Cause you ain’t really nothin’ to me
A bitch, but you gave me pussy for free
So give a dog a bone

Givva dogga bone, givva dogga bone
Givva dogga bone, baby baby baby, givva dogga bone

Part two, back in the day I got dumber
Fuckin’ number leavin’ with a fake phone number
‘Cause that’s how a nigga was livin’ like
Treat ‘em like they wanna be treated? Yeah, right
‘Cause a bitch’ll run you over in a minute
Get your ass sprung on a pussy and now you did it
Now you’re doing everything for the hoe
While she out fuckin’ another niggaro
But G ain’t even for that bullshit
You better hit of the shit you was fuckin’ with
‘Cause you ain’t even coming for roni
Niggas are niggas and hoes are hoeing
Like I said on my last song, my dick is long
And I can slang my muthafuckin’ thang like cocaine
And if you ever ever ask on my name
Save up your money ‘cause you got strung
So givva dogga bone

Givva dogga bone, givva dogga bone
Givva dogga bone, baby baby baby, givva dogga bone

We got Boss in the house, we got DJ Quik in the house
We got Second II None in the house, we got…

Bitches and hoes are like new clothes
Yo, once your sport ‘em, you wish you ever bought ‘em
But I play hoes like a banjo, I fuck ‘em and I fuck ‘em
You say a little something while I’m nuttin’ on they belly button
Just to think, if a bitch had a dick
She would probably try to fuck a nigga and jet quick
Just like a nigga would do
Hoes ain’t true, and niggas, that’s you, too
But the bitches are talkin’ the most
Niggas ain’t shit—well, you’re kinda close
Just remember, the next time you’re getting fucked
You think the nigga’s in love? Well, don’t press your luck
Because pussy ain’t nothin’ but a hole
And most bitches ain’t nothin’ but hoes
Don’t forget that fact when you’re laying on your back
Bitch, and remember to moan when you give a dog a bone

Givva dogga bone, givva dogga bone
Givva dogga bone, baby baby baby, givva dogga bone

Bitch, for the ’91 and ’92, AMG is in the muthafuckin’ house

I wanna be yo ho

Lick ‘em low is my motto
Sit on my face, and baby I’ma swallow
I’m just a freak for you, and you and you
I’ll lick your toes until they turn blue
I got a new exercise for ya
Guaranteed not to bore ya
Can I kiss ya lips? The ones in between ya hips
I’ll make you cum ‘til ya cum
And rub your back like I oughta
This is what I do to your daughters
So fathers, don’t get too mad
You did a pretty good job, dad
‘Cause your little girl got a big ass, a cute face
And direction to my place
So you can’t say shit, I like the bitch
So I let her know…

I wanna be yo ho, I wanna be yo
(I wanna be yo) I wanna be your hoe, I wanna be your ho
(Come on now) I wanna be yo ho, I wanna be yo
I wanna be yo hoe, I wanna be yo ho

Be your hoe, indeed I can’t wait
To feed you big dick ‘til your back break
Because you asked for it
What’s up? Give a dog a bone or a nut
Yeah hoe, I eat kibbles and bits and shit
So introduce your lips to my dick
And don’t be trippin’ when I stick ya
‘Cause you’ll be drunk full of dick liquor
And no not Erkin’ and Jerkin’
I’ll have you smellin’ on dick while you’re workin’
AMG, baby, stands for “All Man”, and G stands for “Give it to me”
And baby you know that I’m a giver
How my dick feel way up by your liver?
Don’t answer that
‘Cause I know that you know that you know that I know that

I wanna be yo ho, I wanna be yo

(Baby baby) I wanna be yo ho, I wanna be yo
(I wanna be your hoe) I wanna be yo hoe, I wanna be yo ho
(Check it out, let me break it down)

Since you the bitch and I’m the nigga
I’ll play the hoe ‘til you get sore, and yo
(Put in your booty and your mouth)
And baby, your big fat booty just drives me crazy
So have a dick and a smile, Compton style, freak
I’ll see you in the swap meet
And when you see your name on my tape, don’t say it was rape
‘Cause you know the shit was great
And when I bent ya over, your name was Rover
When you was on top, you said “Don’t stop!”
And when you sucked it long and strong, how could I go wrong?
AMG just had to make a love song
About a girl like, you honey color coated
And your pussy ain’t corroded
So that’s a plus, and big butts I nut
Word to the stunt, I wanna be yo…

I wanna be yo ho, I wanna be yo
(I wanna be your) I wanna be your hoe, I wanna be your ho
I wanna be yo ho, I wanna be yo

Lick ’Em Low Lover,Bitch Betta Have My Money,1991,"(Lover…)

My homies always wonder I keep a girl on my tip
I ain’t the cutest muthafucka and I got big lips
But when I do with what I got with a freak on my side
Get your hoes in check, and yo, what the heck
I eat pussy, and you can even call me a pro
Let me get a napkin and knife and fork—where’s the hoe?
A connoisseur, I’m ready, willing, and pure
A long tongue to get a bitch sprung
Because I’m the type of nigga that won’t say much
But if you got a big ass, fill the glass
With a little more Hennessy
And the pussy right now is looking pretty to me
So come on, girl, get your ass under the covers
And let me show you first hand why I’m the Lick ‘Em Low Lover

(Lover…) Lick ‘em lower, lick ‘em lower
(Lover…) Lick ‘em lower, lick ‘em lower

Papa was a candy layer, so you can call me Baby Snickers
And we had plenty of visitors
‘Cause anytime mama was gone
Daddy had it goin’ on, to the break of dawn
I used  to peep in the hole of the door
And all I saw was feet in the air, and my daddy’s face below
And we was suckin’ and suckin’
But I was tryna figure out why they wasn’t fuckin’ (yo, yo)
But back to the matter at mouth, I mean, the matter at hand
And all I could say was just “Damn!”
If he doin’ what I think he is, lickin’ pussy like a sucker
And that was the birth of the Lick ‘Em Low Lover

(Lover…) Lick ‘em lower, lick ‘em lower
(Lover…) Lick ‘em lower, lick ‘em lower
(Lover…) Lick ‘em lower, lick ‘em lower
(Lover…) Lick ‘em lower, lick ‘em lower

In high school, I was voted “Most Likely to Go Down Under”
And I had more hoes than a street corner
They used to call me Daddy Long Stroke
It was an inside joke ‘cause I was pumpin’ the throats
I mean, hoe after hoe after bitch after bitch
I got a little rich and then came a freak bitch
Named Erica, legs and long hair and a
Booty that’ll make a nigga think she was wearin’ no
Panties or nothin’, bumpin’, I wish she was
She made me an offer that I couldn’t refuse
Butt booty naked I got, she was hotter than hot
I had to licky-licky-licky-licky-licky-licky
Lick her where the sun don’t shine
Took a sip of wine, and prepared for the tongue grind
I licked her up and down and she was mine
I bit her pussy and had her screamin’ and fartin’ at the same time

You gotta be a clean hoe, use soap
And if you feel like I feel, be for real
And if I don’t make you cum, who will?

Big fat butts and a face full of nut
And a tight pussy with a kung-fu grip
Bitch, I’m a journey not a trip
And if you think that you can hang
Suck this dick then pass me a hot wing

Aerobics ain’t shit to a dick like mine

Gray hair on her coochie, titties that sag
I mean, really, she tried to fuck me to death
Ben-Gay on her body, Tums on her breath
I said, “Oh no, yo,” she wouldn’t let go
Big ass strong hoe—what you doin’? Yo

Knocked out the senior citizen with one stroke

I’ll put you on the hood and be damn good
AMG, GMA, gangsta mack, ain’t it
I whipped out my dick and all the girls fainted
One by one, two by two
And those who didn’t fall—come on, y’all
Would you like something to eat?
Come on down, let me feel the beat
‘Cause that’s how I’m livin’ like
Those who don’t wanna bone, you want me take ya home?
Yeah, bitch (Yeah, hoe, sike)
‘Cause you’ll be one walkin’ muthafucka
On a late night stroll like a Compton clucker
And I ain’t even goin’ out like that
You better quit frontin’ and jump in the back, ‘cause…

I rock Backseat Queens, I rock the Backseat Queenz
I rock Back seat Queens, I rock the Back seat Queenz
(G rocks the backseat queen)
I rock Backseat Queens, I rock the Backseat Queenz
I rock Backseat Queens…

And while I’m getting the best of the opposite sex
Hey, I like the play all the dope tapes
Eeny-meeny-miney-mo, let me pick a good one
Break out the stick and dip it in the pudding
Honey colored girls with big butts
Ooh, you make my tongue go nuts
And if you’re good to go, to me, that’s a plus
Yo, dick to coochie, and nuts to bust
‘Cause I’m a young nigga (I got a lotta energy)
Pull down your panties (so I can be your friend indeed)
And like Quik said (Girl, I got that feeling)
Don’t be shy (put your feets on the ceiling)
And get into the good old missionary
I bump the coochies, bald or hairy
And eat ‘em on up like a hoe cake
I can’t wait until I get that first taste
But back back back to the gold seat
To make a hoe come within an oldie
And if I do, I can be the newfound king
Getting busy with a gangsta lean on a backseat queen

I rock Backseat Queens, I rock the Backseat Queenz
I rock Back seat Queens, I rock the Back seat Queenz
(G rocks the backseat queens)
I rock Backseat Queens, I rock the Backseat Queenz
(Get in your cars and vroom…)
I rock Backseat Queens, I rock the Backseat Queenz
(I rock the backseat queens, yo, 304 rocks the backseat queens)
I rock Backseat Queens, I rock the Backseat Queenz
(Yo, DJ Quik rocks the backseat queens, yo, Second II None rocks the backseat queens)
I rock Back seat Queens, I rock the Back seat Queenz
(Hi-C rocks the backseat queens, Moe Doe rocks the backseat queens)
I rock Backseat Queens, I rock the Backseat Queenz
(Trace and Court rocks the backseat queens, and Greedy Greg rocks the backseat queens)
I rock Backseat Queens, I rock the Backseat Queenz

Yo, so jump in your rides, uh, roll down the ‘shaw
And get a freak with a big ass, yo…",https://genius.com/Amg-backseat-queenz-lyrics

Call me the new hoe on the block
Some do like me, some do not
I get paid to lay all kinds of ways
Smoothed out fade with knack for hoe rap
And some said flowin’ to me, was not you
Nigga hoes just went deep for ‘92
AMG almost gold for ‘91
And when I kidnap rap shows, I pack gun
Yes, me, sea to sea, coast to coast
William Mo’ takes care of my dough
I roll Benzos, truck for the snow
Sippin’ something cool like a Bacardi Breezer
And then jim gets greeted by a skeezer…
But anyway, when I grab M-I-C
C-O-O-L A-S I-C-E
Oh, I guess not, no, in or out
Fast, not slow, and smooth not rugged, so
I’m kinda like sex
MC’s receive broke necks when I mic check
And peace to the DJ’s
I ran rhyme marathons for three days
Kinda like tongue relays for the Lick ‘Em Low Lovers
Word to the D, brothers

Now, can you feel it? (Trunk o’ funk)
Now tell me can you feel it? (Trunk o’ funk)

Can you feel it? (Trunk o’ funk)
Can you feel it? (Trunk o’ funk)

Since our last meeting, I’ve been eating
Bombudd cookies, made by Cookie
You see, my mind got escalated by something I love or hate it
But then…I just did it again
304 supplies the tool
Moe Doe will check in hand, he’s the band
Beats by the ounce, dozen, and pound, rhyme for rhyme
Verb for verb, noun for noun
I’m like down for a big fat butt
Pretty lips and hips, and a fat sack of
What is that, Dr. Lovejoint smokes herb? (Mary Jane)
Uh, have you kicked to the curb
So lay back and hit it ‘til ya cain’t
And if you got a bitch wit’ ya, fuck her ‘til she faint
‘Cause your dick ain’t got a brain, punk
So when you’re finished fuckin’, throw her in the trunk
I’m outta here

Now you got rug burns, and sweatin' out your perm
Tellin' your friends how I got it good
Spreadin' my name all through your hood
And I'm glad you ain't got a man
And I'm glad you ain't quit the band
And I'm glad you ain't nobodys baby mama
Cause a nigga don't want the drama
Sittin' lookin' pretty in my silk pajamas
Blowin' me kisses, eatin' left-over Benihana's
And I can't wait 'til you're through
Cause I got somethin' that I wanna do, ooh

Soak me baby, give me that good thing
Make it go round and round
Make it come all way down
Soak me baby, give me that good thing
Make it go round and round
Yeah yeah

You got the kinda look in your eyes
That makes me wanna marry you
But first let me carry you... to the California king
How many carats do you want in your ring?
Do you like ice cream?... Let me licky-licky
It's gettin' sweet, cum 'til you sleep
Later you can beep me or leave a voicemail
With your lil' moist tail
And you know I'll be back cause I love the act
Of makin' love, fly like a dove
Intelligent lady with class
You make me wanna tattoo your name on my ass
Cause I love the way that you do it all
Summer, Winter, Spring and Fall
And you look so good to me
Sometimes I wish that I couldn't see, ooh wee

Soak me baby, give me that good thing
Make it go round and round
Make it come all way down
Soak me baby, give me that good thing
Make it go round and round
Yeah yeah

I wanna get you wet like you wanna get
When I dip between your hips with a thousand licks
No tricks, no hands, AMG is the man
With the plan while I'm hittin' the back and, prepare for the mackin'
I'm stackin', but it ain't your business
I'm goin' up in this - from the CPT to Venice
The 'G got a thousand sluts, that can get these nuts
From they face to butt, say what, say what, ah ah

I used to get sex up in my NSX
Now it's a four-door Benz, for you and my friends
And you got us playin' musical chairs
Baby could you drive while I lick yo' pubical hairs?
I like your pretty freckles, pre-cut speckles
Droppin' player 'phernalia while you lick the genetalia huh
So come out of that sweater and don't worry 'bout the stains
Cause I got a gang of black leather in the back, make it wetter

Make it come all way down

Is it really what I want, or more than I need?
I can make it right, baby, just follow the speed
I know you a freak, I got you up in the suite
I got Q on the beat, I want you in the sheets
Don’t be playin’ with me, you can play with yourself
Livin’, lovin’, and wealth, 30 years on the belt
Shit, I’ll be a gentleman, at least once
Or it’s just my imagination and these blunts

Throw her in a drop coupe, not the Jag
Made it, livin’ lovely, poppin’ bubbly
Home in the country where the money be
I love it when she do her thing
Damn near got me looking for a ring
But when I want what I want she gives me what I gotta get
Pimp to the lip and hip
Slippery as a ship, hit the coochie in the whip
She called me a dog, I called her a…(no, no)
Pretty toes made me buy her the rose
She was coming out her clothes, and I’m tryna drive slow
I couldn’t say no—who would I be then?
My only wish is if she had a twin

When we get together, ride me like a rodeo
Check the portfolio…oh
Do it to your soul, we can make a video
Other niggas want a taste, but you crack they face
Wishin’ they was huggin’ on your waist
With you I could never lose

She’s Paid,Bitch Betta Have My Money 2001,2000,"Dru Down... players up, tricks down
Bosko, AMG mayne
Let's get some green out these tenders mayne
Cause they got it
More doe, more green, she's paid by the game I laced her with
Draped her with, ready to be like me but yet a soldierette
(Raided knee deep in this) Stolen wallets
Fake checks, burnin' the daddy, all cash for that ass
And she knew this, if it wasn't her it was a new bitch
Game don't stop for a pimp, pursue this
Break yourself bitch, the trap broken
She wanted to know why I talk like this (I'm outspoken)
Coughin' off the weed chokin', hop in the back of the two-door
Drive Knievel before I see the penelopes
We weave, don't have time, for the po-po's
But we got all the time to where as I speak right now ho
My Vogues oh, my suit boots and pinstripes
Recouped up on meth the next night
And plus um, at the house I got a new one, you know like major
The new big head bitch Ben Franklin chaser

She's paid, and I like it
She's paid, and she makes me rich
She's paid, rollin' down the avenue
She's paid, she always brings my money through

(She's just my fantasy)
Convertible XO, Gucci and Diamond XO
(Like an image in a magazine)
Sex me like R. Kelly plus pays for my celly
Lobster in my belly, jeans from Pelle Pelle
Private sponge baths so a playa's never smelly
Beach house in Malibu I can always swing through
From breakfast in bed plus head and tails too
Not your gigolo, Bosko's a playa pro
Fo sho' not diggin' but I ain't mad at cash flow
We be bouncin' out a stretch, stratosphere Las Vegas
The rich chose me and choosies can't be beggers
I'm, down to Bone like Thugs-N-Harmony
(For the love of money!) Plus chicks and Mastercard
See, she love to spend and I can't complain
Cause like I told ya before man, the hood has changed

She's paid, and I like it
She's paid, and she makes me rich
She's paid, rollin' down the avenue
She's paid, she always brings my money through

Now the pimps ain't dead, the hoes just scared
And every time we end up in bed I'm well fed
Money don't make me, hoes they can't break me
Pimpin' ain't easy, baby please pay me
You got the lips, the hips to coach bag money clips
And while you're countin' your chips ya like to sip
Cappuccino, but I'm far from a hero
Used to be less than zero
Now I'm multi-million, playa with no children
Livin' in estates, acres with the gates
Ferrari 512, playa haters go to hell
Hoes pop for show-n-tell, can I rock the bells?
Uh, who could it be now? The nigga AMG
With my homie Bosko and Dru Down
California sounds - bumpin' all in the trunk
Cause I'm wreckin' plenty hoes with that physical 
funk, BITCH!

She's paid, and I like it
She's paid, and she makes me rich
She's paid, rollin' down the avenue
She's paid, she always brings my money through
And I like it, yes I like it
I like it, and I'm her perfect playa
I like it, yes I like it..

It's a 304 thing baby
Snatchin the hoes and the loot..
Smack it up, flip it, fly honey dip it
I never bone alone, I got a nine in chrome
I used to be out of luck, now when I get a boner
It often means vagina miner get to the moaner
I mean really cause it's silly ? bumps that I broken
I guess you're gettin dumber ? in the summer
I didn't know a rap song could make your jock that long
Where's your mattress, is it strapped off?
I got a girl, now my dick it need a little rest
Can't be a freak, AIDS killin niggas every week
So when I see the booty on a cutie
Got to turn the other cheek
Word to the diggidy diggidy D
So now I got damn groupie on my snoopy
A year ago, now you're up in the butt
Though I didn't know, that I would know, so many is good hoes
By the look that you chose, you're undercover pros
Praise the Lord, bless your soul
In your Gap and your tight clothes and your fake gold
I forgot the hair, gettin paid for your derriere
Shakin it and bakin it, while a nigga steady takin it
For a ride in a Benz or a Beamer
304 have you seen her? Have you seen her?
AM, pump with the trunk of funk
Won't luck fuck for a trunk of stuff
Wouldn't give me the play when I was Jay, now I'm G
She got the okay, she seen my CD (bitch)

Tres with the bass, mo' go 304 is a groupie
Stompin, AMG ain't from Compton
Better yet Bed-Stuy, N.Y
Some of ladies wanna know why I say bitch
To get rich or to make a point about a trick
A bitch is a woman who sucks and fucks
A dumb nigga for his duc's and bucks
A ho is a girl that'll do the same
With no shame, and less game
And baby, I don't want neither
Bitches or hoes, I keep my shit in my Girbauds
Or wrap it up tight in a jimmy hat
For a red bombudd and a hootie mack
L.A., home of the one night stand
Like playin craps with your dick in your hand, you understand?
So this is for the college and the high school crew
Cause y'all be out fuckin like a zoo
You better quit, before your dick goes

I switch it up, now you see I’m rocking 23s
I’m counting paper but you know it is not loose leaf
Riding round a round in a two-seat
Yeah we riding, yeah you know we flying
Always riding, she always got me dying
(She’s just like a lecture)
(You don’t wanna impress her, she’ll lay you on a stretcher)
Lay me on a stretcher, I’m dead as ever
How many times does it take, don’t remember
But my head hurts (yeah)
I can tell i’m in a maze
I think I’m stuck in a phase
Just like Travis I’ve been down and lost for days
You see I’m trying to look at my face
But I cannot impress her
She is like a lecture
Boring as ever
Running and now my legs hurt
Yeah my legs hurt, ‘cause I’m always Running from you on a daily
I know what I want you can't phase me
Dreams and reality start fading
I think that I’m going crazy
But I can’t, life is amazing
And I wouldn’t even change it if I could
Think the evils taking over all the good (Yeah)
Doing things I never thought i could
But I am falling (yes I’m falling)
(I don’t wanna impress her, she’d lay you on a stretcher)
I don’t wanna impress her
She’s just like a lecture
Boring as ever
Running from you and now my legs hurt
Get out my face just like yes sir (yes sir)
(She is like a lecture, boring as ever, Running from you and now my legs hurt)",https://genius.com/Amg-lecture-lyrics
