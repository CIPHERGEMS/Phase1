(""Yooouuu better watch your step!"")

Hey yo
It's all love, but love's got a thin line and Pun's got a
Big nine, respect crime but not when it reflect mine
The shit I'm on is wrong but it lasts long
Pull a fast one on Pun and wake up with your stash gone
I'm mad strong, and my cream is fast
, smoke the
Greenest grass, my bitch got the meanest ass
And a taste legit, I don't have to waste a whole case of Crist'
All it takes is my pretty face and my gangsta wit
Lace the clique, 'cause we all share, it's all fair
Like love and war, 
thug galore with the long hair
Big Pun, Pun the name that makes the kids run
Like spelling murder reverse it deliver redrum
Come one, come all, if you wanna brawl 
I'm the mighty
Thor clotheslining motherfuckers like Steven Seagal
'Cause all you're gonna get, is your ass kicked or up in a casket
That's it (That's it?) That's it

Punisher
Bash it, at last it's rappers that really blast shit
Cats getting Big Willie niggas like 
Billy Bathgate
Up in Jimmy's Cafe, having caviar
Crackin Cristal at the bar, smokin' cigars, livin' large
We rob and steal, run with the mob, doin' jobs for bills
I'm hard to kill for real, nigga, guard your grill
I like to chill, spark an L and get high
I'm one hell of a guy, 
fly pelican fly

Whattup Duke-o, you know, politickin' papi chuco
I'm out here, 
watching for Jake
, getting this loot though
Shoot bro, I got a waterproof suit yo
Swervin' like a A.K.A. in Beirut yo
Squeezin', out of automatic M3's
 and
Please, you ain't seen no thugs like these
I can tell you lots of things that'll make you believe
In Corona, yo, it's better to take than to receive

Your career's on life support, and I'mma pull the plug
And have every thug shootin' that Beatnut drug
In they blood, no escapin' this, 
niggas is
Goin' over their favorite shit (for what?) to be tapin' this
World premiere, loud and clear
Lah and beer,
 get the dough, blow up the show
Disappear, jump in the Cavalier
Feelin marvelous, street pharmacist, 
twist arboles
For pleasure, bring your territory terror
Keep my workers under pressure got em sayin' ""FUCK LESTER""
But that's aight Duke-o, my heart nowadays too cold
Don't give a fuck where you been, what you done
Where you go, you know, peep this statement
In black shades like a secret agent
We're night thieves, 
roll up on you like sleeves
We light trees, bust these and stack cheese

Aren't you? (Mmm hmm) Don't you wanna fuck me? (Mmm hmm)
But first...""

A'ight, and away we go
You got the World Famous Kool with the smooth-ass flow
I’m speakin' about what I get with or stick on the reg
Got you running round in circles fiending for the third leg
But baby, don't you go yet, cause you ain't really strong
You haven't even had a taste of my motherfucking tongue
I say motherfuckin' 'cause your mommy was a victim
Your cousins, sisters, aunts, oh yeah I licked 'em
I tricked em and they all come back for the treats
But I don't eat the cake before I frost the feet
And you get weak like S W to the V
Soaking wet victim in between my J sheets
And ain't no freak could lick you up and down better
Even if his tongue was silk, he couldn't get you wetter
Find space on my face, give me all that you got
So I can get up close and kiss that pretty twat

Get hit on by jailbait but pay it no mind
Because I never ate a dish a day before its time
Now I'm givin' brothers in my town the fucking blues
'Cause 'fore I knock the boots I wanna lick the shoes
Get dirt on my chin, still puffing a bunch of smoke
She screaming shoot her cream, right down my fucking throat, nope
I never let a dark honey pass
I just slam my face in that fat Onyx ass, gasp
The chick was 69 not 61
That's when I bust a nut but the bitch never cum
Hum mmmm mmmmm
I gots to have it cause my tongue wants
To keep her going like that fucking rabbit, just grab it
But say no and I won't be pushy
Just make me change your mind, so I can lick your pussy

Cause I can dunk like that fuckin' Harold Miner
After I see you here now you're in for a suprise
My lips are suction cups in a fucking fat disguise
Rise up off the bed in a twist
I make your head spin like the fucking Exorcist
Miss Mary Jane, you blow for a change, come on
Act insane and suck out my damn brains, the main
Vein is up for spring cleaning
Trick licking on my balls, yeah now you got me fiending
I'm dreaming, I'm in the cemetary sucking breasts
I pet the clit and put the pussy to rest

Dripping out my mouth baby

Aiyyo my song's on, I gotta get my grub on some to-to
(I love to-to) Order three buckets of Mo'-Mo'
We gettin' more dough, off the books (you gettin' jelly)
Pullin more hoes off the looks (you gettin' jelly)
You wan' hate me? Cause your wifey, wants a autograph?
From the look in her eyes, I can see she wants more than that
When I see fat asses I make fat passes like quarterback
Beatnuts is ALLA THAT, your shit, ALL THE WACK
Open can-dela, if you foolin' wit my cheddah
Hardrock, ever since, junior high escuela
Fly fella, takin my beats, to make your crowd get up
I'm fed up, niggas wanna bring it -- WHATEVER!
I'mma storm your pa-rade (pa-rade) blow your legs off
With a gre-nade, now you flappin', like a mermaid
Yappin off, bitch you cough at the lips
While I'm at the bar, baggin', the bartender tips
Then I bag this chick, with a, ""Hi,"" and the eye
She did the butterfly, rubbin' her ass, against my buttonfly
I could already imagine my shit stuck inside
Everytime I strike, haters be like, ""Dat fucking guy!""

How's that yo? It's hard for you to swallow
It don't take much for us to let the metal holla
Lead's bustin out of a old black Impala
Thug nigga only fuck wit, muchacha malla
Big Ju, dimelo el coño, how we do?, how we do? (How we do)
(How the girl don't only love me, they love you!)
Whatchu gonna do? (What, what, what?)
Nigga whatchu gonna do? (What, yo)

Here's to my pollyin' niggas who campaign
To the killers who be lovin' the chicas and champagne
Thugs who get wild in the club and snatch chains
Players who be pimpin' the hoes with no brains
Front watch a nigga get shot from close range
The most range, crazy motherfucker won't change
Beatnuts, forever diehard, you want pain?
Cause you walkin' outta here breathin' is insane
Flip a beat fast, you leave the club with a heat rash
You got a weak stash, came in the club with a free pass
I ain't even know they made a Roley for your cheap ass
Makin me laugh, you was in jail wearin' kneepads
Now the beef has gotten over your head
It's over you dead, Ranger Rover, both of your legs
Till both of us said, platinum gettin' took this year
Cause for real, there ain't nothin' but crooks in here, nigga

How's that yo? It's hard for you to swallow
It don't take much for us to let the metal holla
Lead's bustin out of a old black Impala
Thug nigga only fuck wit, muchacha malla
Big Ju, dimelo el coño, how we do?, how we do? (How we do)
(How the girl don't only love me, they love you!)
Whatchu gonna do? (What, what, what?)

Oh, oh, oh! 2 G's mother, uh!
The Beatnuts y'all, uh!
Uh, oh! Juju, Psycho Les, uh, oh!
Turn it out oh, oh my god oh!
Oh, oh, it's the hardcore b-boy shit!
Hard to the core motherfucker, no keyboard shit!

Aiyyo the Nuts landed, so pack it up
Pass the mic to big Psych, the manufacturer
The architect, bringing you the art of wreck
You used to hate my click, now you want a part of it
We coming with more hits that funk like Parliament
Comparing me to another's going to lead to an argument
The heat we fry you with, straight from the armory
Guerilla army, we kill tracks in harmony
My Nut orchestra blowing fuses
Your amp can't hold this music, it's booming
I'm in my truck cruising, 97 tuned in
The latest news is the Nuts new album is ruling
Y'all vs. the Nuts, you have a big chance of losing
(There's no escaping this) Or confronting the union
So stop fooling yourself, and feel these Nuts
Cause (No one's ready to deal with us) What?
(No escaping this) (Repeat 3x)
""No one's ready to deal with us""

Don't be humble, it's better to pull
Belive you eligable, get left like a vegetable
Man it's crazy and there's no escape
It's turned into a police state
The average cat don't even know his fate
Walking round like he hurting something
And there's nothing that he got to say that's even worth discussing
Listen to me, it's better to be
Lying dead with honor, soldier, than to never be free
Young niggas out here losing they dads
In the battle, others turn into fags
Every other country burnin' a flag
Don't let history repeat itself
That's how the devil plan to keep his wealth and feed himself
I'm the New York power hitter
Hit the devil in the fucking shitter
Take his manhood and all his glitter
Got guns ready to bust
""No one's ready to deal with us""
(No escaping this) (Repeat 7x)
""No one's ready to deal with us""
""Can't get away, there's no escaping this!
Surrender now, come out with your hands in the air

Oh, no! Turn it out oh!
Oh my God oh! Turn it out oh! (Repeat 4x)

Swing a bat on you like the devil himself
Put it on us, sickness or health
Making you could only breathe wit help
I ain't playin', you don't wanna hear what you sayin' yourself
Hit the street wit incredible beats
We renowned for tearin' it down
Never have you heard a similar sound
Like a drop off when shit pop off, feel a hot one
Side scorching from a hot gun
Niggas get lost in the buildings wit money and the children
Not the type to talk too much and catch feelin'
Dominican flag over the bed on the ceiling
Protect everything I rep, that's the first thing
Many things follow, bullets stay hollow
You actin' like we don't chew, you can't swallow
Niggas try to change my plans, I'mma beat you till I break my hands
Ju the German every place I stand (""Se Acabo"")

All day everyday (""Se Acabo"") mothafuckers!
Step up front! What's goin' on?

Aiyyo it's Big Psych, baby you don't want no problems
Suckers want war, and yo bomb em
Bring the heat, squeeze the flame torch
Then peel out in a convertible gray Porsche
Just in case your snitch wanna get payed off
I'm three miles ahead of you, I took the plates off
Pull out the chainsaws, It's a Musical Massacre
Cut the head off the driver and the passenger
Sic my dogs after ya, have you climbin' in a tree
Just another crime in the street
Ain't nuttin' better than findin' a beat
So if you find that and try to blow my spot up

Huh, ready, willing and able to rock cradle
And rock steady, when I get the drop I drop heavy

Do You Believe,Stone Crazy,1997.0,"Ayo, it's ill when I'm heated how my heart stay cold
Write a rhyme that make the gats around the 
world
 explode
Now behold the burning malice of a treacherous soul
First time I shot a gun duke, I was 12 years old
But since then, I've never put it down my friend
She go to war when I tell her
Fuck a who, why, when , til the end
Indeed its good to have and not need
Even better when you can shoot back and not bleed
Take heed, 
poppin like an El full of seed
My team is gettin bigger, got more mouths to feed
Shorty let me tell you bout my only vice
It got to do with lots of money and it ain't nothin nice
It ain't nothin nice

Ay, you believe in God?
You do, tell him to save you
Cause me and these niggas here
We ain't tryin to pay you
Regardless of the fact that its close to home
I gotta finish your life, so I can start my own
My own nigga

Ayo , my audios guaranteed to lift the audience
It was that time again
So we gathered up 40 men
40 ounces, trees burning, heads bouncin
Dollars is the mission
Sittin in the yoga position
Isolate my mind from your bitchin
Pulp fiction
Lose you in the mix in
Lets get this poppin, lock down the top 10
Knockin pretty boy cats on they ass each time we drop kid
Yeah, you know how we comin'
Raw grooves with the funky drum drummin'
And when my song goes off
You'll still be hummin'
Noddin' your head, or singin my chorus
The after midnight feen
The 4 in the morning blunt feen
Peelin dutches
Fill em in like taco shells
Willing judges
Wheeling jake with half a cake in my coat
Pointin gats like remotes
At cats with federal notes
Tossin bodies off boats

Reign of the Tec,Intoxicated Demons: The EP,1993.0,"It's the hard little pistol-packing punk dope smuggler
Lethal when I kill, I go straight for the jugular
Back again to hit ya with the junkyard funk
Shit gets out of hand, I got a Tec in the trunk
Let's flip the ill shit kid, yo he looped it
Hardcore, straight to make you brothers act stupid
Now I'm on a rampage, prepare for the slaughter
Lyrical monster busting nuts in your daughter
Slaying competition is the real beat digger
(Clank) Hit you with a shovel now you're dead, nigga
Freaking the funk, I be the ill funk freaker
With the diabolical sound coming through your speaker
Bulletproof ready for action, no fronting
Fully loaded Tec, chump, ready to go hunting
So sleep and watch me let off and catch wreck
""John Wayne couldn't even stand the reign of the Tec""
When I pop the trunk, hit the deck
""John Wayne couldn't even stand the reign of the Tec""
Head for the hills before you get wrecked
""John Wayne couldn't even stand the reign of the Tec"" (Repeat 2x)

Here I come up your block, drivin' drunk
Smoking skunk, waiting for a fucking punk
To beef, so he can get killed by the psycho thief
Retarded like Biz, eating cats like Heath-
Cliff, light the spliff, crack the quart and
If I kill you first nigga, be a good sport and
Die, don't give me no hassle
I snatch up your bitch, take her to White Castle
To crack her asshole, so I can fuck her
Hit that doo doo brown, then buck her
The crazy rapist smelling like much vaginas
Carjacking punks, pulling 'em out they Pathfinders
It makes me want to scream, but I just chill
By the end of the week, how many punks must I kill?
I'm sticking up picnics, I'm robbing 'em good so after dark
Stay the fuck out the woods (You fucking punk!)

Head for the hills before you get wrecked

Come on girl, don't give me that shit
Blast my nine to your spine, take your money then split
Audi, now your ass is ghost to me
Beatnuts on the loose sticking Hindu grocery shops
So what's up hops?
I shoot you with no problem, I'm used to shooting cops
I'll let you go this time, but next time you pop
That shit, your ass gets dropped

Yo, it's the gun-slinging lunatic demons outta hell
Intoxicated punks letting off bad smell
Beatnuts forever, die hard motherfuckers
Low-key deadly, taking out all suckers
Before you even step and try to play me, son
Bring heavy ammunition so you don't have to run
Take heed, this ain't something you should laugh to
Yo I'll shoot your moms if I have to

Finger on the trigger low
Quick to lick a shot for that bigger pot of gold
Lock and load, my heavy metal rock and rolls
If you gotta go, you gotta go
That's part of the show
My heart is cold like Antarctica, nailin niggas like carpenters
Stalkin the hardest squadrons
Spark them from New York to Arkansas
Watchin the projects how I got my logic
Economics is pickin pockets then we split the profit
The only shit I pop is when my Glock spit
Watch for the cops since we spark the chocolate
Cuz the blocks are hotter than the fuckin tropics
In topless bars, college girls with no bras
My whole squad got blowjobs smokin Godfather cigars
Live large like Scarface
Parlay in a far place
No car chasin, she's watchin all the stars in space
Safe in sound in my playground with my trey-pound
Got eighty rounds just in case clowns wanna play around
I lay it down for them non-believers
Them non-achievein niggas that wanna be leaders but can never beat us

Fuckin with me, you outta your mind, get outta your jeep!
Know I'm gonna beat you till the police come
And tell niggas who the fuck I got that Rollie from (The Beats)

Jump in the Pit
Beatnuts fuckin up shit
Ju hold my gun and the clip
As I smoke one and spit
Ammo over the piano
For a man's show, you don't understand bro!
You do, don't make me laugh at your ass
Cuz you don't even know the HALF of the HALF!
When I crash on the scene
You know it's me and a bunch of crazy cats outta Queens
So hide your shine, hold your bitch and stop smiling
Beatnuts will never stop wildin
Pit Fighting and rockwilding!

Picture a king
Wit heater, holy book, and big rings
Real niggas doin big things
Interpreting dreams off of Jim Beam
Ain't shit Sweet but Sixteens
My gods got the block sewn to the inseem
I'm on the other side tryin to get green
So I fast at grass and ass at least a day
War with self I battle the Middle Eastern way
Bring heat like the months that's east of May
Casted in the role and saw a new school nigga that knows the old
G memory I hold the scroll, my flow is a Road
Less Travelled, you rock but been through less gravel
My mystique suggest battle, and what have you
Rip a nigga from New York to west coast, Chicago
Don't give a fuck where he from
He'll get beat like a drum
Till this rap goes numb, seekin the hot producer for circu-lation
I strangled his string music and suffocate his drum
Wanted to be a star until I seen I was the sun
Got my weight up like Pun
Improvise to get ass, emphasize to get past
Fuck a mic check, I bring my flow in cash

Props Over Here,The Beatnuts: Street Level,1994.0,"Sho nuff with the funky bass in your face
New York City have mercy, have mercy one time
Introducing the crew...

Hey, you ain't really you and you ain't really down
Plus I'm tired of seeing your fucking phony face around
Cause when I sit back and think back on how you flam me
It make me react and be at my fucking jammy
Now I don't cock, though my mind's in the sewer
I just kick back with six-packs and then I do her
But she gets stuck on clawing like a cat
And cause them toes got sucked on she don't know how to act
Back in the days, I.S. 237
Used to run with Kevin, bagging hoes was like heaven
Eleven years later I try to hide
And hope they pass me by like I'm the the Pharcyde
Just let me puff and lounge with my niggas
Don't have no time to fake funk with triggers
Don't believe in kids with that puss cat scent
Fuck around with Fash and get your whole shit bent
Spent crazy years with the Blues paying dues
Before I met the Psychos and the Junkyard Jules
But now the crew combined and we can't be stopped
Going round the globe to collect our props

When I'm in New York, you know what I wanna hear
(Yeah you get props over here)
Come on, out in Cali, you know what I wanna hear
(Yeah you get props over here)
When I'm down in Detroit, you know what I wanna hear
(Yeah you get props over here)
Now when I'm out in Philly, you know what I wanna hear
(Yeah you get props over here)

I get stoned every day I got nothing else to do
I'm getting drunk with my niggas til the night is through
And when the night is through I won't have a fucking clue
Of what tomorrow will bring so I maintain (true)
Yo life's kind of funny
If you don't make money then your days ain't fucking sunny
Excuse me for my language but I'm trying to get my land stitched
Together, and build a crib for me and my damn bitch, I never
Had it like I deserve to have it
I whip it, I stab it, I grip it, I grab it
You silly rabbit, I'm coming at you pure
Tracks by the stacks, video and brochure
I'm sure, unlike others wanna pop
You's a piss drop, talking that shit you need to stop
Cause when I approach and you can't back up what you said
(Toma!) Fly you fucking head like that

Now when I'm in Atlanta, you know what I wanna hear
(Yeah you get props over here)
Texas, uhh, you know what I wanna hear

When I'm out in Chicago, you know what I wanna hear

Out in DC, you know what I wanna hear

Real niggas do real things and that's a fact
And real niggas could leave big holes in nigga's backs
And your life sounds like a heavy price to pay
For some bullshit that you ain't even had to say
But don't sweat that, cause I'mma let you keep your head
If I wanted you killed, you'd already be dead
I got a lot of things to do, a lot of money to make
I got no time for you and all the moves you fake
Taking care of business yeah without no doubt
And I'mma make a million dollars kid before I'm out
Yeah I gotta give a shout to my peeps in Corona
Going hand to hand getting loot on the corner
Life is full of stress and it wrecks my brain
So I puff the buddha bless and destroy the pain
I got a lot of things to do, a lot of money to make
I got no time for you and all the moves you fake

When I'm in Japan, you know what I wanna hear
(Yeah you get props over here)
When I'm out in London, you know what I wanna hear
(Yeah you get props over here)
Hey when I'm in Norway, you know what I wanna hear
(Yeah you get props over here)
And when I'm out in Paris, you know what I wanna hear

Look Around,A Musical Massacre,1999,"1999
Beatnuts, dead prez
CHORUS:
Everytime I look around, I see so much drama goin down
Everytime I look around, I see so much fakeness goin down

Why I'ma, be stingy when I can share
Why I'ma, be hateful if I could care
Why would I hate my own, and forsake my home
Why would I fuck around and get a jake my chrome
I wouldn't have to stick you if we all could eat
It wouldn't be no need for beef, dyin over streets
We don't even own anyway, you could get bucked off any day
We behind enemy lines, y'all still writin Henessy rhymes
While I'm tryin to get a good price for a nine
Feel like my life on the line
That's why a nigga be hype all the time
Ready for the revolution at the drop of a dime

I got a duty to have security for my niggas
My duty to serve the beautiful black sisters
A duty to stand with anybody that's with us
And fully criticize all bullshitters
There should be awards presented, to niggas who fight back
Like Panther jackets, or sisters who like gats
I'm a full blooded warrior, ready for change
Recognize any soldier that's doin the same
Because I love who I am, and that means everything to me
My life ain't worth
A damn unless I'm dealin with reality
When I look myself in the eyes it's
Just me
And I ain't gotta tell nobody no lies I feel free
And I would
Rather deal with the truth than falsehood
Than bein fake with my people and
Claimin it's all good
You can't run away from yourself so that's
Useless
If your word is bond then you don't have to make excuses
CHORUS

Yo as I sit and contemplate about the fate of my kids
If I die, is the state gonna snatch up my kids?
City life, no choice but to live by the knife
Put food on the table at whatever the price
My beautiful wife, all the time cookin precise
When there ain't no meat, she bless me with the eggs and the rice
Never think twice, I love you for the rest of my life
That's why I taught you how to shoot when situations get trife
Save the children from the evil that we smell in the air
Used to bein happy, now the feelin is rare
I'mma soldier in the struggle just tryin to prepare
Cuz when the revolution comes it ain't gon be fair

Yo it's the Beatnuts, dead prez, we connect like Tetris
How we comin at the world on some Malcolm X shit
So turn it up, so we can drop these gems quick
If you on some bullshit, then nigga hit the exit
There's enough cash, grass, and ass here for you and me
You wanna be greedy, sayin fuck the community
Watch out cuz life's gonna change very soon you see
I really don't believe we could ever have unity
This shit is serious we all tryin to have a milli stash
But love life cuz that's all a nigga really has
Love your fam, cuz that's all you really have
And handle your biz and stop bein a silly ass
Ayo it's gettin, gettin, it's gettin, gettin it's gettin kinda hectic
Slugs burn, so naturally thugs learn to stay vested
You need to learn a Psycho Les-son
And treat others the same way you wanna be respected, because...
CHORUS
Live together
Feed each other (feed each other)
Die together (die together)
Love each other (love each other)
Eat together (eat together)
Show each other (show each other)
Fight together (fight together)
Know each other (know each other)
(*2X*)
CHORUS

Bring the power back to the streets, where the people live
Bring the power back to the streets, where the people live
Brother, brother, there's too many of you dying
War is not the answer
Too many mothers crying, oh this is a revolution, yeah yeah yeah",https://genius.com/The-beatnuts-look-around-lyrics
Hit Me With That,The Beatnuts: Street Level,1994,":
We got that funk on lock ""Ya, ya better, ask somebody""
:
HARDCORE, coming with the beats and rhymes
GOT YOU HUMMIN', now you wanna press rewind
BEATNUTS COMBINE, going line for line
Ay yo, Juju ""Hit me with that shit one time""

It's the hardcore funk, come get your fill
From the pistol packin' punk, raisin' hell with the thug grill
Nobody cares what I think, so I drink
Causin' mad trouble, pullin' guns in an eye blink
From the depths of hell, I make it known son
My mind frame makes MCs swallow their own tongue
I dismantle competition, it's a sick shame
When I lose my composition and inflict pain
Doin' what I gotta do to obtain cash
Accountable for more dead bodies than a plane crash
I make it clear that I'mma never be forgotten
And you couldn't find another MC that's more rotten
It's the junkyard nigga, get your shit straight
Peace to all my niggas in Queens pushin' big weight
Ric Man always taking care of buisness
A shout to Corona and I'm out with the quickness

...Ay yo Fash ""Hit me with that shit one time""

I got so much of this, and ah so much of that
And so much just fucking cool in my act
That niggas be stressing me trying to mock the steelo
Me though, born just one smooth negro
I got it like that, I make a bitch wanna dress up
Watch me slide in, and see your fuckin' hoes press up on me
Box like an army, it's crazy, they swarm me
But me just from my ballin' baby
I see like my section and ah, wanna perfect and ah
And slide my shit up in her motherfuckin' rectum bro
Erupt let off nuts just like a cannon
I'm standin' in the same damn spot I fucked Shannon in
Laid that ass hoes a wanta break want a drink
Did that 6-9 shit, I'm suckin' clits, she's suckin' dick
But stickin' back and lay way back don't try to fester
Who posess more chicks than fuckin' P.M.S

....Ay yo chocha
A-yo Psycho ""Hit me with that shit one time""

Splash, wet that ass like a jacuzzi
Niggas all say ""Who's he, the nigga with the uzi?""
The hardrockin' up the blockin', state of mind
Just finished puffin', about to sniff my second line of coke
Frequencies float like a fax
See blunts and six packs
Enjoy the fuckin' tracks
Blastin' for your listenin' pleasure
It's got a two-bar loop, with the funky measures
I can rock it even if it ain't for the pocket
You need to wake up bro, and smell the fuckin' chocolate
Hocus pocus, you can try to focus
But you won't see me, I see you like fuckin' Oprah's
Fat ass, up on a fat-ass screen
Slice your Adams apple, kiwi strawberry Snapple",https://genius.com/The-beatnuts-hit-me-with-that-lyrics
Ya Don’t Stop,The Beatnuts: Street Level,1994.0,"You don't stop, you keep on!

It's the Junkyard nigga, kid, you know what I'm about
Puffing on a fat one, guzzling a Guinness Stout
Boning bitches on a regular
My game is lethal, that's my word, I'm telling ya
Living foul like a motherfucker
That's the way it's been ever since I was a shorty, sucker
So don't even try to flex
I'll put a round in your chest and leave you in a fucking mess
Niggas know my style, they be playing
If I have to catch a body I will, know what I'm saying?
Niggas from Corona don't be having it
You put your face in my grill I'll be stabbing it
You fuck around and catch a bad one
I'll kill you like a six-pack and put you in a bag, son
And I still ain't fronting
Fully loaded Tec, chump, ready to go hunting


I come equipped with shit that's fucking wicked
Damn, niggas can't fuck with the program
I take a stand and look down the clip
Take a swig and spark up the spliff (boom!)
Niggas know the time with the Beatnuts funk
John Wayne got smoked when I popped the trunk
Punk, I told you once and I won't tell you twice
I smoke the blunts and we won't pay the price
For pussy or any fucking mass
But the raw dog style in your girl's ass
(Ho, ooh!) I think I just came
Stud's break didn't work, I guess it's all in your brain
Shit smells like demon spirit
Learn from Exorcist, punk, you can't come near it
So fear it or you'll go out like the priest
Don't you know, man I'm the wicked nigga from the East Coast


Ooh child, motherfuckers down with the licks
Oh shit, I'm hitting niggas sick with my tricks
So throw up styles that blow up whiles I go
On with the flow, better act like you know
But I won't take no prisoners, got shit for his-n-hers
Fucks up you all when the nuts have a ball
Cause we don't play, blast brains with the smoker
Get fucked up when we toke with the joker
And, never let me see you crying
Heads start to flying, it's time for the dying
And I'mma get real deep, fall into a sleep
Knock a freak in my sheets, man, fuck counting sheep
And come on, step on up and meet my Tec
Either fill you full of wholes, or wring your fucking neck

It's the crook with the shit look causin' mass danger
Torturing crew like Jews in gas chambers
The angel of death - street smart, lyric arranger
Complicated, my styles change, I get stranger
Freak flows, let opponents know
That I combat the stats and defeat the foes
Gots to get money kid, you know how it goes
And I'm still livin' foul even stickin' up hoes

Equipped with the Beatnuts funk
Ain't another brother kickin' phat beats with spunk
Duck tried to test me but his ass flunked
I rolled him in some Bambu and threw him right in my trunk, punk
I told you once and I won't tell you twice
I freak the stunts and I won't pay the price
For stickin' in her paradise, cause it's all good
I know you wish you could

You got the blues but the Kool is your saviour
Down to just daze ya, Beatnuts wanna blaze ya
Raise ya, give you junky juice that was major
(And you don't stop)
Comin' from the soul, cause the heart is the funk spot
Diggin' through shit that I found out in the park lot
Talk not, bustin' crazy shots at the dope squeeze
Ju, come down spray these niggas with that funk please

Somebody said you were looking for static G
Those who try to play me close could die tragically
I got a merciless flow that's emphatically fatal
It attacks the brain automatically
Unleashing lyrical wrath to leave you open
Crew that choose to bite might find yourself chokin'
Dirty and low, I never do what the pope says
I'm tryin' to get money like Felipe Lopez


With a 1-2-3, a 3 and 2-1
Only type of twat a preacher could eat is nun
Hon, don't it sound sweet to the drum?
Drum, trip as I flip 'til it's done
Son, act like you recognize dad
Run to poppa come get what you never had
I'm (superbad) and ducks get mad cause it's all good
I know you wish you could (get funky)

We got you wanna more puff from the Nut
Go on take a hit from my shit but it's a rough one
Bust one, remember what they said never trust one
Use to be two in the crew now it's plus one

Competition is none

Niggas got me steamin, bout to flip my lid
Fuck around, and I proceed to blow your back out, kid
(Boom!) Not to say I'm on a violent tip
But my hand stays on my gun, in case you start some shit
Cause I been rhymin since way back when
Straight up and from the heart is how it's always been
Now punk niggas wanna test me
But all that tiggedy-tiggedy tongue-twistin shit don't impress me
It's just a phase, and you know damn well
That you'll fall off in a minute, cause that shit don't sell
Funny how you think you could surpass me, or outlast me
With that bullshit style, you're fallin fast, gee
See, I suggest you go back where you came from
(Your mic, and my mic) Come on, don't play, son
See, the days of payin dues is over
I'm a little fed up, and it's time that I show ya
We battle one time, you're dead, no sequel
Your mic, and my mic - come on yo, no equal
You know we're number one
Competition is none

The wiggedy-wicked Psycho Les drops it like a lunatic
Steady back-breakin bitches with my super dick
Hat's on the jim, sometimes I nut in em
St. Ides fucks up their eyes, and I pin em
Down, while I'm flowin to this nutty sound
Open up the knapsack, check out what we found
H-h-horns, bass, lines
Beats get chopped in the Nut Shop, we don't waste time
Yo, I'm 'cold lampin' like Flavor
Floatin at the top while you sink, and 
'nothin can save ya'
Just like the Biz said
Remember - uugh! - styles I drop to be, what is it?
(The shizzit) Word to your mama
I bend your girl like a comma
Do the Lambada, I think I gotta
Stop, because the bitch said, 
""para!""
So I nutted, and I got out
(Boom!) No matter how hot you claim to be, you can't roast this
Nut, what's up? You wanna get eaten up like a hostess?
'Cup', 'cake', you know my words are lethal
(Your mic, and my mic - come on yo, no equal)

Every line I connect, my literature's perfect
Per minute, per second, and yo, you gotta reck-
On with Fashion, cause by the way I'm rippin things
Whoever thinks I take a loss has hamster brains
Young dames, I shoot em and Jimmy aims to knock her
Sex with this flex, best thing tends to lock up
Yeah, really bad ass, smokin past you niggas
The chicks I stick shit with, I love your figures
Triggers, I pull em with no remorse for bodies
Fash pumps the hotties, chumps pump with shotties
Shoot em up, bang-bang! Miss targets rarely
Mics I touch up, I fucks em daily
Barely another who can test the cool Fash
Asses I kick in the ashes, dumpin trashes
So don't riff, cause I flow swift like the Nile, son
Tame is for plain Jane fame, I'm a wild one
Auto-matic-ly I let loose the
Fierce MC-i-n-g force in me
Cool Fash, sendin a blast to rap people

Knock knock, who is it? What my moms is the wizard

So open up, let me in, then
Check out the ill motherfuckin Les swing
Wickedy wicked, your girl's tit I lick it
And shwin-g it, like my man Wilson Pickett

Rip a show, get the dough, and stick the ho with my super *dick*
It's a AHH nut, then I be ghost
You got ta be clean everything not gross
I bust a ill style that your ears are not used to
Beatnuts make tracks for the crowd to get loose to
So honies in the house if you're hot rip your blouse off
My brothers if you're thirsty, crack the forty ounce
Beats I smack em out the stadium I never bunted
I rock all night, you got a light, let's get blunted
So light up, and pass it, so I can puff
You can't get enough of the rugged and rough

Hardcore, crazy bad breath like a demon
Retarded from birth see I ain't got no class

Freakin' mad styles catchin' seizures, yo
It's the Psycho Dwarf killer with a caesar, bro
Ugly like shit, my style's crooked
Any piece of ass I ever got is cause I took it
Yo I'm invisible, niggas can't see me kid
I did a short bid and came out cock diesel kid
Junkyard JuJu so you know
Strap a metal jacket every fuckin' place I go
So play Dionne Warwick's song and Walk On By
Or maybe stick around for a Colombian Necktie
Whatever the fuck you do, just get out the place
I got some shit to blow that smile right off in your face
I wanna fuck, drink beer, and smoke some shit!
Fuck, drink beer, and smoke some shit!

""Get on down""

Ah-ah-ah, I just ripped, out the dirt from my coffin
Flippin' through loops like a lunatic dolphin
I'm back, reincarnated
Psycho Les runnin through the graveyard intoxicated
Thuggin', titty huggin graf art muggin'
Keep ya where your worst nightmare snuck in
Yeah! Ya think I'm buggin here's my Glock 10
I have you singin like New Edit-it-edis-distion
Punk, play and get yo, smoked
I put two caps and I laughed up then joke around
I gets down, like Kool and
The Gang my slang got your girlfriend droolin
Yo I flip, and, land in the split
Then pop, man, bust your whole shit
Like a Shaolin Monk I kicks the grand funk
Drunk and I'm still fat out the trunk
I wanna fuck, drink beer, and smoke some shit!
Fuck, drink beer, and smoke some shit!
I wanna fuck, drink beer, and smoke some shit!
Fuck, drink beer, and smoke some shit!

Cuz the moon look bloody and the gat's too strong

Better gates R.O. style
Black escalades
Fucking with gats they gonna find you in the everglades
Me and looser
Smoked about a pound of buddah
(gunshots) that's what I'mma do to ya
Hard-hitting, leave you with your shit splittin'
Half you niggas out now is just be shit spittin'
Top-notch
Left hand holding my crotch
The other one on the glickitty-Glock

Heyyo Psycho's the name
Let me remind you
You a snake in my grass don't make me come find you
My whole click starving like a jail cafeteria
While you on the block sucking cock up in Siberia
Crack a cold one
Blaze a hot one
Turn the mic up let me drop one
When I release this, u better go cop one
If I hear my dogs barking I reach for the shotgun
We stand tall like the twin towers
And we pssss... piss on u cowards

(Scream and gun click) Hammer Time!!
(Scream and gun click) Hammer Time!!(2x)

I hate niggas that claim thug and won't be it
I'm tired of niggas yelling cops when they don't see it
They shouldn't be here
You won't see me when the smoke clear
3 blunts, 2 shorties, and a cold beer
Big Moon
But I smoke too soon
Spitting heat
Rhyme to the dirtiest beats
Love the streets that's the life and I like to live it
I got a right to get it, I'mma shine in the turn??

Soon as I touch down
Hit the deck splattering ya'll
Blast ya'll imitators
Know I'm badder than ya'll
Baddest than all ya'll, fall
Deader than the presidents
And shoot down New York
Like that nig ???
Milly cats
So sit on them cats
Four five we feeling ya caps
Inferior scraps
Shit, I'll fucking blast you to Nantucket
Chick you gotta love it
Now grab the dick, suck it

Kevin Killaz be that nigga straight murdering tracks
Herbing them cats
That can't flow on beats for shit looking at raps
Hurting they raps with powerful paragraphs of punishment
Believe me when I tell you, u don't want none of this
Front on this and get your snot-box rocked like Charles Dutton
That's the P.R.O line u though I wasn't still fucking
Predict with this hypnotism
Got ya'll niggas under a spell
Heat tucked under my belt
Front and it's felt
Straight up and down with no preservatives
Act like you heard of this
I'm from BK where they murder kids
For little to nothing hammer time
Niggas start ducking
Chickens start clucking
In the club when the gat start bucking

(Beatnuts Talking)
Hammer time ya'll
Feel this come on
Iraq nigga shit you heard
Come on...",https://genius.com/The-beatnuts-hammer-time-lyrics
Are You Ready,The Beatnuts: Street Level,1994.0,"Intro-
What we gonna do right here is......
Yeah, yeah, come on, come on
Yeah, yeah, come on, come on, come on
Check it out, check it out
Yo, yo, yo Who the fuck is that nigga rhymin' on the mic?
WHO IS THIS MOTHERFUCKER?

It's the wicked, nigga with the super dick
Fuckin' ho's like I'm supposed to be in a flick, UH!
One time, I tap yo mind, I got you hummin'
Now you want to press rewind
I pour rhyme in your ear to develop suds
Slice the fuckin' Philly and break up the buds
Who's Buddha? I don't know, is it a special
Stick a fork in your neck and pop a blood vessel
The hispanic shaft packs a gat, too
Permanent scar your ass like a tattoo
Slam dunk the funk in your trunk, punk!
Da Doom Doom, Do Doom

Yeah, cool makin' moves nigga so smooth
Scarin' ya, hangs up in the 'Skills
But Queens is like the area
I stare at ya, tear at ya, break that back
Now crack the fuckin' sack and roll that shit black!
Act like you want a nigga and watch me hit him
Then I have my shottie' let my brother Divine get him
We got him, ho's comin' through in the clutch
She said I only suck that dick cause I love you so much
Said I only lick them balls cause you so game tight
And you keep my ass climbing the fuckin' walls at night
So hit me, hit me one time, let me flex it
Crew's still makin' moves but now I've gots to exit
 4x
::Are you ready? Y'all ready for him?::

Hold up, you know I gots to get my wreck off
Fuckin' rugged like a dog about to bite your neck off
Police still puttin' fear in the hearts of mad crews
Leavin' people lyin' dead in the street with no clues
Soul like a mother got the funk on lock
You can hear my sounds echo through the urban block
Got stacks of stocks, and fat beats to knock
Got you open now you're hopin' that the junkyard rocks

Okay here goes the blow, the bag, the mint
Grand time to represent flavor so strong
Fills the room like Buddha stick, uhuh, don't like choke
Gotta get paid so we're tryin' to go for broke
Beatnuts hit the rhythm and I join right with 'em
Niggas can't see this flow so it's time to down sit 'em
I kick the flow for the niggas with the bald heads
Dreads, and 'fros, honey's, but no ho's
Oops! I didn't mean to call you ho, bitch
But when you try to clock the pocket that's that bullshit!
So let's get down with one of New York's finest
Seed to the brain like Primatine to clear the sinus
Grand Puba, Stud Doogie with the mad style
Beatnuts comin' with the rugged(Hey You, watch out now!)
It's on motherfucker, can't you see that?
No shame in the game, so Doogie where the weed at?

Beatnuts Forever,A Musical Massacre,1999,"Psycho Les.. JuJu!

East to West, even if you wearin a vest
They gon' find you with a crowbar dug in your chest
Look at the best, 
still only second to Les
And even he said he don't want it with me, figure the rest
Bigger distress, whole crew avoidin the rest
You know the name of my click, nigga it start wit a tres
Dog that'll reload and bark with the best
Dark with a cold heart spittin darts through your flesh

You know the street code, stash the kilo
Jump on a speedboat, blowin weed smoke
Countin G notes, I made off the Chino's
But this one Chino wanna play cochino
So he standin in front of me lookin stupid like a moron
Crept up on him (CREW) caught him with the forearm
Called up Big Ju, M.A. nigga, the war's on
(Fuckin with this bitch dog, let me put my drawers on)
Chorus: Beatnuts (repeat 2X)
Got my eyes on cheddar, as I strive to live live and better
Cause all the shine will be mine forever
So it's now or never, we get down whatever
Four-pounds and leather, Beatnuts'll let off rounds forever

Bite your face off, pull your heart out, flood it with steak sauce
Chop you up, til there's no limbs for me to break off
Kick your stupid ass it's just tragic nigga and take off
Go kill everybody at work and take the day off

And pay you a visit
And knock your door down, strongman with the four-pound
Put the joint in your mouth and push your jaw down
(Oh) You ready for war now, lacin your hightops?
Toma
, one in the head, now who's the cyclops?

No peace, niggas want beef, you know we love it
Champagne under the arm, gun in the bucket
Never seen it comin like that, you had a chance Pah
Now you like, ""Oh shit! Guns on the dancefloor""

Corona Queens, where half of my crew be at
You didn't expect this booby trap cause I'm such a groovy cat
If you my dog then I got you with a Scooby Snack
If you a ?, fakin a movie jack?

I let the mac off, finish the act with the hack saw
The plan is you vanish, like you standin on a trapdoor
I'm back for what is rightfully mine
I spitefully rhyme, every word a trifle design
Chorus

Yo it's the livest nigga you ever heard, that's my word
Like a demon spittin Hell at 
thirty-three and a third
You wanna do it with Ju, you gotta find me
And if you do FAGGOT, better sneak up behind me
See that's the only way that you gon' get me
And if you wet me I'mma turn around and laugh so you never forget me
To my double-gat niggas who talk shit and bubble crack
This year, y'all niggas gon' hear me on a couple tracks

Spittin like a thirty-eight caliber
Any challenger? One stands up, get handcuffed, to the banister
Beat down your manager, now leave with my dough
You can't be mad at the, hustler from the Queens borough
It's Big Psych', we can go at it, like a pit fit
Everything I spit tight, go out after midnight
Like a vampire, call me your messiah
""To burn my kingdom, you must use fire""

Three, four you better lock your door
Five, six beatnuts in the mix
Seven, eight now let's get it straight
Nine, ten for everybody that slept

Biz Mark Beatnuts we about to rock it
Now pull it out your pocket
Pull it out your pocket
Psycho Les baby, I'm about to drop it
I'm just a villain
Chillin in my gangster stand
I cop all my threes from Amsterdam
I make them Black Eyed Peas kids say 'That's the jam'
Beatnuts baby back by popular demand
Drop another jam
Sock you and your man
If you don't know by now, BLAM
Y'all small soldiers wanna blast back
Like a wedgie I'm gonna get up in that asscrack
Feet first
Whip a concert with no rehearse
You wanna spit you gotta talk to me first
The ringleader
Blow your cover
You think we cool cuz I know your mother?

Yo, elegant flow, stomp you like an elephant tho
You only got a little money and you spendin it slow
Anything you gotta say is like irrelevant yo
I need money like I gotta let the President go
From a hostage situation that's surrounded by smoke
In a trailer in the middle of hell, nobody know
It's the junkyard hannibal lec
Snatch the first grabbable tec
And look for any catchable wreck
Back in effect, slap you in the back of the neck
I've been holdin this down for a while, show me respect
Rainin the tec and all of that, breakin your neck
It's off the hook this year, two niggas called me collect

*phone rings*
Who's this??
Who's this??
This is a collect call from... a clown


YOU'RE A CLOWN!!!!

I saw you at a party uptown
Nobody even know you, you just standing around

YOU'RE A CLOWN!!!!

Don't even try to step outta bounds
Cuz if you drink and start a fight nobody holdin you down

YOU'RE A CLOWN!!!!

Lookin through the records I found
It takes more than that for you to duplicate this sound

YOU'RE A CLOWN!!!!

My heat'll lift your feet off the ground
Live niggas throw the bacon and move it around

I follow recipe
Over on sesame
This time the kid.... Psycho Les'll be
On top of the industry
This one's for my niggas in the street
I'm lookin at the situation so I gotta flip a beat
Make your heart skip a beat
So we can all eat
Went from a project kid with a calculator watch
To a rollie, to cashin them royalties
You must be a fool playin with this hungry dog's food
Snap at you with a rude attitude
My troops landin parachutes I hit you with phatter loops
And y'all clowns better show us gratitude
Werd up

Me & les rock the house
MC's rock the house
The Beatnuts rock the house
The rain with the tec rock the house
It's the Biz Markie as you can see
I got more rhymes than Muhammed Ali
I'm one in a million just like Aaliyah
You look at me and say Mama Mia!
I sing funky records most definitely
Ain't no other MC that can mess with me
I know my man Les you remember music factory
With rhymin big Sam rest in peace you see
I rock the mic and you will know
That I rock the mic and go ohohohohohhoh
Sing a funky record MCs'll say
Ain't no other MC like B I Z M uza A
From New York york L I I
New Jersey z I am fly
Straight out the DC and Maryland
Gotta give a shout out to Virginia with the skins
Singin funky records most definitely

Here I come, to the rhythm of the drum
Hook you up on some of that shit that got you numb
Open up hon, I just want to see in
The shoot my semen, the intoxicated fucking demon
Shoots the load at home or on the road
Baby doll i buss a style to put you in the mood
Tanqueray with the lemon, ice with the tonic
Want to place an order for a samwich bag of chronic

It's the mad Puerto Rican with the beats in command
Hold the 40 with my left and keep the blunt in my right hand
My game is tight, I got the flow
And my style's a mystery that niggas will never know
Rolling in my jeep mad deep
With a live crew, of crazy motherfuckers that don't sleep
(So don't try and sweat his route)
V.I.C. yo

P-P-P-Presto
Another Kool Whip with the magic, so tragic
I'll beat your little ass, fucking faggot
It's the season of the hunt, fucking runt, I get buck and
Blast when I buss your ass sittin duck
So back up, how the hell you ever get gassed
Break fool, and I'm a kick some Kool in your ass
Puff up your chest, inhale, you're dreaming
Now whip out your brains with intoxicated demons

Yo niggas try to pull my card and disrespect
Get blown the fuck up cause I ain't playing with a full deck
I ain't the one, kid, you wanna fuck around
I got 50 niggas in here now holding me down
Never be running outta ammo, i got more so
I may just empty the clip into your torso
Step back, watch the body drop, ain't it funny
Now you said all that to say what, money?
""I keep flowing to the beat of the sure shot
My favorite jam of all time is ""The Body Rock"" (Repeat 4x)

So fucking lay back and I thought you knew
Shit get cold when the Kool come through
Hey but only with my style cause only Fash can do it
Through it, yeah, catch on bake you blew it
Blow me, or shut the fuck up, you can't hang
See the slang, drips from my lips with the bang
Boom, got a box of lead for a nigga
Cause before you lick off *bang bang* I pull the trigga

Yo I came to get mines, straight up, fuck the game
I'm all about mad loot, guns, and fat chains
Act like you want, don't front or feel the fury
I catch a homicide charge and see the jury
Quick to put a head out, kid, let me remind you
Bury that ass where God can't even find you
Fucking with the Junkyard nigga's like a bad move
I keep my finger on the trigga I can't lose

You know that I know who's a friend, who's a foe
Best believe I know who's my girl, who's a ho
It's the klepto, dropping verses while you dance
Blow! Blast you, call the ambulance
Owww, bitches all say while I'm steppin
What happened? You forgot to load your little weapon
Oh no, now you lay on the floor

Droppin' bombs on heavy base, ""BOOM!"", now your speaker's gone

It's the original Psycho any other one's a clone

Look in my eyes it ain't hard to see
I pump fear in every goddamn coronary artery
Big guns, big drums both bangin'
Allstars gonna have big wing coach dragon
Metal man bloody and junk, it gonna happen
Jihad intoxicated overlord rappin'
Come on money what you hearin'
Whole hood'll be X-Filed when niggas just start disappearin'
JuJu make it hard to breathe I understand
Niggas couldn't have heart if it came in a can
Niggas act funny, I just love money
And my life is a reflection of that, A'ight? Dummy!
Scary expensive my wardrobe very extensive
Let's face it Jerry's eccentric
Who want to rumble with the K'ah
No good to playa, no hood to slaya
Your flooded in my daylights
They lose pay'otch, do chaos
And if you with it from the junk do say'os
See me my more, find your spleen on the floor
Punk one, dunk one, got your team on the floor
You never seen me before
Needled in with your men's
You don't know me like you'all gonna see my face again
You see my face again if you'all about witnessin'
You a judge, DA, you tongue Glock kissermen (kiss noise)
One shot whistlin', lead bore glistenin'
Crack your dome you faced off like Nick n' him, son
Out the cage you saw my rage
It's big boy toys, baby talkin' Glocks and gauges
And my hock's contagious, spit flues till I'm thru

Swept you home like a broom, then I roll that witch
Switch over to the right hand or back to the left
See, whichever one I use, yo, it still spells def
D-E-F, And I do work with these
Lift a chick with my dick like I'm Hercules
Jerk me please, help me let off some of this cream
Comin' down on you in drops just like pieces of a dream
Seems like I am a mother, so word to me
Burnin' mother-fuckin' rappers in the third degree
Servin' thee, or a so-called superstar
Cause no matter who you are, you still catch a bullet scar

Click, click, BAM! Let off a couple
One for the beef, two for the trouble
Three for my niggas that are ready to set it
World's famous...Man, forget it

Still livin' foul, yo, ain't nothing changed
So I'm a hit you with a rhyme-shot at point-blank range
But still hardcore and everything that goes with it
Gettin money plus I'm bagging all the ho's and shit
To the critics, tryin to sweat the life I live
I got a fully loaded clip and no love to give
So don't stress me, cause I ain't tryin' to hear that trash
Come test me and I'mma have to bust yo, bust yo, bust yo...",https://genius.com/The-beatnuts-let-off-a-couple-lyrics
Yeah You Get Props,The Beatnuts: Street Level,1994.0,"You know sho' nuff, Nuts got bass in your face
Take a taste, World Famous trio in the place
In a race, cock and blast for your sugar
Bucking niggas off just like I was picking boogers
I heat up, now I got the competition fired
Said he better than the Kool then the nigga's fucking lying
Cause I'm a trip up, when I slip up, maybe rip him
He with his man then I gotta fucking dip him
Pa-pow, give him one right to the kisser
Used to peep a shorty and I think her name's Clarissa
I miss her, plus the way she freak when I'm sleeping
But I'm out to get the loot so I gotta keepin keepin
Keeping on, til the props come rolling
In, a billion women, I be like holding
Folding up my Glocks cause the Fashion's def
I bring my homeboy in, I just kicked my last breath

Yeah nigga, get live, it don't matter
I got the double-oh shottie, 12 rounds to make your body splatter
With the ill-type flow, a wild renegade
Blowing niggas up for dough and just getting paid
Yo my style eats through, it's like cancer
Eliminating your whole crew and your dancer
Never front, I do work, believe that
Now I wonder why you and your crew couldn't see that
You know what I wanna hear, you know what I wanna hear!
(Yeah you get props!) (Repeat 4x)

Uh, pass me the M-I cro P-H-O-N-E, tracks we got plenty
To spread, yep, 
I had to fuck up Fred
Cause he caught me fucking Wilma donkey style on his bed
Fucking red-handed, the Nuts have landed
Busting nuts in bitches guts and then leaving 'em stranded
In an abandonded house, no blouse trying to escape
Got the bitch on video tape
You should have saw her trying to scratch the face on the villian
Told the bitch to stay the fuck out the woods but she chillin
So with no hassle let me catch you by my castle
If you're a bitch I'll fuck you, if you're a nigga I'll blast you
Ask a question, 3 seconds to answer
Kill a photographer shooting as a freelancer
On a mission trying to peek over my shoulder at the vinyl
The wino, coming at your ass like a rhino
Punk you know what I know, who deserves props
See you couldn't figure B out with an autopsy
Huh, it's like that, we could never be the wack
Black it's like this, step up and get dissed
You know what I wanna hear, you know what I wanna hear!
(Yeah you get props!) (Repeat 4x)

Yeah word up, this shit goes out to my niggas Edison and Slam up North
3CF Mob in effect, kid

Yeah, to all my niggas, all my niggas upstate, youknowhatimsaying?
Counting months, my brother Devon, the whole crew, youknowhatimsaying?
Curry Clan, my nigga Sam Dean, you know what

Psycho Les:
Holy shit! Jack got the house jam packed
World famous Beatnuts makin' moves that's alike
Black 24 track EQ the fuckin' bump
You stare too long and your ass will get jumped
Chump smack you with my elbow
Watch the el flow takin' crews down to hell hole
Mak the dead become active, 40 ounce
So I could pronounce every as it is
Right pass the light so I can spark it
But you wanna puff? Bring on the chocolate bag
Your tail wag where the lighto
I bust at your ass trying to shoplife my item (superbad)
Shame on you fuckin' boo, but I don't sweat it I deep my cool

Talking:
Ha yeah that shit sound right word up yo Fash run that shit!

And to the back and make it cool ass Fash cause I be blastin'
Wettin' niggas up and shit
That pussy good so I'm a be all up in it, fuckin' it
I dive in sluts on the reg
Got one for your head punk even if your lead cause I'm cool
And you can be cool if you tried
Just hate it when them dumb motherfuckers act fly
Well I went down pulled nut my fuckin' jamma
But shit started gettin' thick so I had to cock the hammer
Like Boow! There you go on the floor
Now you can't fuck around with these nuts no more
See niggas fakin' just hangin' with the funk
But in old eyed junk can always swant with the funk
Check it, trunks get popped in the nick of time
SO you suckers back off cause you can't fuck with mine
Hook:
""Yo we the Nuts that make you sream nuts""
""With the diabolical sound comin' through your speaker""
""When you need the funk in your trunk bump the Nuts""

JuJu:
Yo I""m comin' out my face like a mad scar
I'm all about the money the bitches and drive around in a bad car
Cause I ain't takin' no shorts I play for keeps
I stay strapped cause I ain't got no time to roll deep
Rugged and raw kid my heart pumps acid
Through my veins watch your brains get blasted, What?
I came to freak the funk on the real tip
The junkyard niggas like still I don't feel shit
And all the hoes out here just be frontin'
So I proceed to hold my own and maintain
And get mines those that try to front can catch pain
You know my style so prepare for the slaughter
Your shit is underground my shit is underwater
Cause I was crazy yo even before I started rappin'
And I'm a pull your card if you think it can't happen",https://genius.com/The-beatnuts-superbad-lyrics

(Come on down)
(You're listenin to the world's famous)
Beatnuts y'all

The wiggedy-wick-ed, Les starts to rip shit
Beatnuts makin' crazy noise with some hip shit
24-track, e.q.-ed to attack
Pump mo' watts than any Radio Shack, Black
I stick to bein' ruff and rugged
Anti-pop, I guess I'll stay broke (Fuck it!)
A crazy hispanic, Psycho Les panic
Nah, not me, I just pull the automatic
Out the knapsack, and cold point it
Blast ya, and leave your punk-ass disjointed
Yo, I ain't goin' out like a punk
Nothin but fat rhymes and beats for your trunk to pump
I make you wanna jump (jump) like Kris Kross
(Beatnuts gonna blow up!) Slow down on that Crazy Horse
My hand's tied from the mic it holdes
I'ma jet up the block before the record shop closes

V.I.C., droppin styles you ain't used to
Nice with the lyrics, when I produce I get looser
Beats I got plenty, they come a dime a dozen
I got more beats than Puertoricans got cousins
Diggin every day, I'm the breakbeat doodle
I got the funky shit, ask my main man Ju-Ju
Jump in the trunk, we Audi on a mission
(Guess where we're goin?) Philadelphia, beat-fishin
There's always one store niggas always get stuck on
I know a lotta spots that are ain't puttin ya up on
Find your own beats, you're a real snuffalafagus
Lazy muthafucka, you're always bummin off of us
You know there's no one finer
Diggin for shit from here to North Carolina
The name is V.I.C., it's time to dilly-dally
First I hit Texas, then I'm 'goin back to Cali'

Ju-Ju, the true blue funk nigga
Ill with the grooves, it's the real beat-digger
(Buyin old records is a habit) Diamond D
But if I can't afford to pay, I'll bag it
You can laugh and joke, but you'll never see me smile
Ruff and rugged, kickin' the hardcore freestyle
Flavor-filled funk, bust the way I word it
Punks who pop junk, kid, tend to get murdered
Not a violent kid though, prefer to freak the flow
Check it, loop a funky 45 and I'll wreck it
Face it, here's somethin' to make you jump around
(Jump around!) And 'get down, get down'
Honeys always sock me tryin to get my attention
Flexin, schemin' on the caramel complexion
Ju-Ju, the beat man, under God's protection
Beatnuts makin moves like a mob connection

Yeah, yeah
Gonna send this one out
To cool-ass Fash
My man Daddy Rich
Can't forget Lucien

Find a nigga up with the dough, where the toast is
Hoes say I keep it up like posters
Slap the first nigga that plays me the closest
Still drunk, still grabbing chochas
Dark and sneaky like the rats and the roaches
Careful in the way you cats approach us
Cause playa, you more out of shape than the coach is
Junkyard nigga, collect yourself
You're letting that persona effect yourself
That's not enough armor to protect yourself
If we catch you, coming through the projects for delf
So be smart duke and spread the wealth
We got cannons looking for a head to melt
Hit you with eight shots 'fore the first one's felt
That's how we do it around here situation dealt

It's the Indiana Jones
Funky stone city cabrones
Names ring like cellular phones
Look back, fall back, catch a heart attack

Your the type to draw a weapon, just to draw attention
I pull your heart out, and leave you with your chest flaming
With no special effects by Wes Craven
This Psych Les reigning, Tech and the Mac spraying
Duck, before you be on your back layin'
Nahmsaying? You asked for war
I'ma take my gloves off and smack your jaw
I just got back from tour, niggas running their mouth
Like they're gorillas, till the guns in their mouth
Now their not killas, they not mad at me
Now they just screaming, ""Don't kill me, I have a family!""
It's big Psych I push it down like gravity
And bring the pain to your brain like a cavity

Straight from the cemetery, with bass like Ron Carter
What's up cus, you forgot who I was
Slept on THE BEATNUTS, now you're shocked from the buzz
A crazy hispanic, no need to panic
Drop words over beats, clear, no static
Backflips, pullin' honies with the hips
After a show, you say yo he really
Ripped shit up, people all get up
Treat your girl like a puppet, stick my fingers in up
But, naw, I'm joking, Buddha smokin'
Never chicken chokin', just donkey strokin'

And, bring me back in
So I can do my thing, with a Beatnuts ring

Mentally asleep

I freakin' hard with your moms & your sister
I hit her hard from the back, then I dissed her
Foul and rude, that's my style
I hate to smile,  I like to drink
Bust shots and act wild(Boom, boom, boom, boom...)
Now's my time, I'm gettin' paid
Drive around in a nice car, gettin' laid
Havin' mad fun, cause you know it don't matter
It may sound bugged, but I'd like to live fatter
Feel the vibe, check the flava
You caught in a trance, now nothin' can save ya
You lose your mind, then you lose your soul
If it get's wild, then you lose control
Yeah you can run, but you can't go far
Everywhere you look, right there's where you are
You hoped and dreamed to be a big rap star
You dreamed your drivin' and you crashin' a car

Sparked by desire, you know what I mean

Pull the chocolate thai stick get off the brick

What up, real pimp niggas on the cut, what up
Uh huh, let's blaze it
Yo check it out yo
I hit the world unexpected like a meteor shower
Twist L's, Hennesey sour, pass on the powder
Make an entrance like a vigilante wit a vengence
Fight for independence, like my descendants
Write a whole chapter, compressed in one sentence
I blast in an instance, America's most makin a toast
Fine women playin us close
Underground to the street level
Money and jewels we embezzle
Never play the fool for the devil
The temptation is there to hug you like a grizzly bear
Fuckin wit the wild life, beware
Willie Stubz the underboss and I move wit force
When po-po take a loss I have no remorse
You know the deal, only blazin shit that could feel
Beatnuts be movin the crowd like blue steel
Cho-cha-cha, that's the three course meal
""Cha cha cha, forward back
Cha cha cha cha, back forward""

Yo I pop up like sicles
When you ain't on point like hard nipples
I flow, y'all clowns merely trickle
Like hot sweat down a fat bitch ass cheek
I'm so nice that I'm not, call me nasty
I bite my toenails and spit em at wack niggas
I used to sell crack, now I'm gettin rap figgas
Too Hype to be Unsigned,
 so I unwind, puffin on vines, baby and nines
Till the spotlight is mine, pullin up in the Lex truck
Wit four chrome rims, ha for the best buck
Three TV's and twelve-changer cd's
Bumpin everything from Beatnuts to the Bee Gee's
Ain't nuttin funny like Missy wit her hee-hee's
MC's get popped but not wit no bibi's
Swing calhoun and styles like Sassoon
Vidal, fuck a trial give me hundreds for miles
""Cha cha cha, forward back
Cha cha cha cha, ?
put it on me
?""

You don't know the half so
Sit down fatso, watch me blast boats like gas blows
Outta assholes, I'm on a roll
So butter me, bitches wanna mother me
Take they bras off and smother me
Irkin me, for an appointment
Cuz they love jerkin me off of the ointment
It's Pyscho, the new pimp, the new pimp
Dead all the bullshit, get wit this new hit
As I hit the bong so, stay Puff like Sean Combs
Bang heads like bongos, you get the *gong sound* like The Gong Show
Catch you comin out the tree spot
Cripple you wit a knee drop
Now you struttin real cute like a peacock
Personal injuries when faces run into these
Y'all niggas need more treats, fuck them keyboard beats
Hip hop hippy, jump in my whippy
Light up the clippy and let the vibes hit me, c'mon
""Cha cha cha, forward back
Cha cha cha cha, back forward""

Yo I used to spit outta anger, now I just spit out a banger
Flip and pull your lungs out wit a hanger
I'm not a trouble-making nigga, but I handle my beef
You on some Eric B. shit, like, ""What happened to peace?""
Got no problem wit smashin teeth, fuckin your wife
Robbin you nigga, kidnappin your niece
Bless your cheek wit a permanent crease
I'm a problem you don't need
Y'all probably go run for police
Y'all could sell all the drugs in the world
Hang wit all the thugs in the world
Won't be the first hole that I dug in the world
Taste dick when you kissin your girl?
Well you should cuz she swallow more nut than a squirrel nigga

Throw the truck on the sidewalk
What, no rules and regulations baby girl when it comes to the butt
Show a real mutha-fucker some love
Let's get some blue and wines and somethin' I got some trees in the glove
Shorty smellin' like dignity, I ain't gotta do a thing today
So I'm a let you hold the Pinga, okay?
Now put it in your pretty little mouth
Sit back and comfy like you was in your house
Brown skin Boricua with the sexiest scars
She nice, wanna fuck me on the hood of the car
I'm a hit her like she's goin to jail, leave her ass sweaty and pale
Open like the dick is on sale
What you thought Ma, you fuckin' a man
Hit it as hard as I can, suckin' toes ain't part of the plan

Fuck, what?

Your mother sucks cocks, and your father

I beat too savagely, it doesn't even matter to me
I hold this down like gravity, reality
Is unloaded, the foul mouthed brain exploded
The gun-totin, the Charles Manson pres votin
The bitch chokin, the hydro cheeba smokin
Leave ya witcha nose broken, the ill spoken
Killer, fuck your little girl like Magilla
The wild Gorilla, gun down Barney Miller

Can't shoot a cop son!

Here's my ultimatum, niggas don't have my shit laced
No question, little did you know, you came here for confession
Cross-examination, my organization stack figures
And when you fuck up we chop heads, no fingers
Fuckin around, with those Beatnut niggas
Now you missin body dumped in different rivers
Full-fledged rapper with the Stone Crazy singer
I'm comin at you with the ice pick yellin ?Bre vega?
Because I perceive you a sneaky, analyzer
Touch the equalizer, get shot by the tranquilizer
Who shot ya?
Who? The bilingual mandingo, roll trees
But prefer leaves, don't give a fuck about drug beefs
Peep the headlines, stay high
Twenty-four/seven, lali out with the red eyes
*singin* You must be stone crazy (repeat 4X)
Intoxicated, intoxicated, intoxicated
Fuck you was thinkin nigga? Fuck you was on?
Round and around and around and around

While shorty's in the front row, trying to squeeze my baby-makers
Off the anchor, wake up and smell the sancor
Bitch wanna sit on my lap like I'm Santa in the VIP
Getting my dick sucked by a red-head with big juggs
Taking pornographic pictures, let's make a sandwich
Pull down your panties, crack open your buns so I can spread the mayonnaise
Haha, delicious, (yo that shit is crazy)
Yummy, bust nuts in your tummy

JuJu:
Yo, on the real honey, let me let you know about me
Cause ain't too many people who can talk about me
See frontin' ain't nothin', who they tryin' to jerk
Half of them niggas talkin' can't pay for the work
They in my pocket, this flow, they can't stop it
Shit, 20 bricks and a dream team to mop it
Who wanna knock it?
Get blown out the socket (Hey, who's gettin' money?)
Remains the topic
Stay true, somethings in it for you
I know you wanna get down, Martinies and Malibu
That's a dream, pay attention to the scheme
Follow the rules and we could all get cream
Hook:
Baby if you give me the ass (baby if you give me the ass)
Maybe you might see some cash (maybe you might see some cash)
If you think I'm moving too fast (if you think I'm moving too fast)

Pyscho Les:
Where you from?
Q-Bourgh, harsh and rugged like Marlbourgh
Beatnuts new joint (what?)
Give it to you radio style, so heads can groove
Gotta make this move in 9-7
Attack with the most hunger
Got mouths to feed and we ain't gettin' no Younger
No doubt, mix the Guinness Stout, with the Colt 40
Toastin' the majority, stay bent
With tobacco spilt on the pavement
Feelin' my beats from the basement, on this one cut
No killer shit (shhhhh)
That's why we hit you in the head with a joint you familiar with
Hook
JuJu:
Yo shortie rock we can wine and dine
But in time let me remind, eventually I plan to be
Somewhere behind you, mind you
Never the less here to refine you
Take you outta deaf and dumb and unblind you
No game shortie, don't laugh
It's all math, material things just don't last
So light this L and parlay with me
Cause tonight shortie rock you gonna stay with me
Pyscho Les:
Son this beat is mad hot, 100 degrees
Slide back the sun roof, catch a breeze
Let out the smoke from the trees, torch our beat
Surrounded by strink G's
As I count Ben-G's, I clocked off this track doin friendly
Kick it to this chick in spicy like Wendy's
Tried to touch her tata, honey said ""ah-ah""
Turned down the Chupacabra
But I was like...

And I knew then I'd hit 'em

Once I plug the plug in
I have them ruggin' for the druggin'
I'm a animal under the sheets
When I'm bangin' you

In my system
Switchin' lanes on the streets
Keep you close on
When you have clean one steam one
Not she wanna suck a mean one

Right here that's where you need to be kneeling
Come on girl sex you with sexy
Poppin' that thing all over the plexi
Take my money abuse and molest me

Maybe you can make a man fall in love with a blink

Baby, I be S-T-O-N-E Crazy, red Mercury blow your spot up
I keep one eye on snakes the other on jakes
3rd eye on my money with no time to take a break
They only break I make is when I gab the breed and jump in the get-away

Pop my CD in your Sony play, twist a fatty, kick back
And enjoy what I got to say, cause this type of shit you don't hear
Everyday

Big Ju, rough and raunchy, never nonchalantly
And huant me to live in this world that don't want me

Murder for the smallest amount, money to count
Cuban cable givin' cash around the table
My record label watchin' the sons steady and stable
Bit my shit, but you wack and wasn't able

Get they ass ripped, that quick, trying to play me like a camel
Fuckin' with my moola, telling me to change my formula

Looter, bag your whole store like my shooter
Click back, put a hollow point cap in your temple
We get caught, it's strictly mental
A stone crook, I don't go by the book
You can't fool me with your gangster look
I truncate a Judas on my turf for wet pay
When I roll a blunt, they better rollerblade out
And don't try talking bold
Cause 
I'll smack you with a bat like ""Walking Tall""
What? You punk, who's gonna defend you
When I bumrush your ass and stick an icepick in you

Don King sized hand

Slept for a while on my style now I'm stunning 'em
Bagging 'em, plus I hit their hoes in the mean

Seen crazy niggas get lost in the shuffle
With dreams turned to rubble then bust like a bubble

Niggas fuck around and get shot for no reason
Junkyard nigga, represent every time
Corona's in the house and yo Gab!

My rhymes quake up to a 9.4, ready for war
Come forth, I bust my fronts with your spinal chord
Thought he got the drop, I possessed inside
Better off trying to survive under a cyanide landslide

What the fuck? The fuck is this?

Puffin' on a cloud feelin' high
Happens every time whenever I'm with my guy
Trippin' on love and it feels so good
I can't help myself and I wouldn't if I could

Off to the Poconos with a couple hoes
In high heels with open toes
Blowing smoke out my broken nose
Bent at the cafe like smoking Joe
Ask me if I'm choking no!
I'm seriously bout it like MP I'm a shout it
Come early and rowdy cause it's gonna get crowded
Hold on to your honey (why?) we all about it
When we start that puffin' watch the place get cloudy you can't breathe
After the show honey screaming Les you can't leave
But I gotta, so I grab my main squeeze
And bounce to the telly to drink and blaze trees

Puffin' on a cloud feelin' high
Happens every time whenever I'm with my guy
Trippin on love and it feels so good
I can't help myself and I wouldn't if I could

Yo, I only fuck around with you cause the rest would tell
You know you love it plus we do it in the best hotels
Ain't nothing like them niggas you had
You be sad, Ju the nigga you could never introduce to your dad
Nobody keep it realer then you that's so true
Body any man who dares to put his hands on you
Expense paid vacation for two surprise boo
Make you scream like a gypsy when I'm putting it through
Leave it swollen go tell all your friends Ju is holding
Guaranteed to make honey nut my shit is golden
Never folding like twenty boxes of trojans
Hard like an iceberg honey thinking it's frozen
Make you get sweaty and hot ready or not
Laying up in tellys with plenty of pot
Dru Hill don't know what I got they better stop

Puffin' on a cloud feelin' high
Happens every time whenever I'm with my guy
Trippin on love and it feels so good
I can't help myself and I wouldn't if I could
Puffin' on a cloud feelin' high
Happens every time whenever I'm with my guy
Trippin on love and it feels so good
I can't help myself and I wouldn't if I could

Surprise the tri-state unexpected like a blind date
Crime rate goes up every time we drop
We can't be stopped every time we chop beats like a meat shop

I'm a monster for music so prepare for a creature double feature
Take a seat I'm gonna teach y'all
Take notes forget them Cristal clowns
Beatnuts baby how real hip-hop sound
Refresh your memory with a Psycho Les melody
Yo what the fuck you telling me?
What the fuck you selling me?
I only cop it if it's that potent thing grown in Poland springs
And one very very important thing
Always quality and not quantity
Unless it's not the hy-drilly and naturally better look out faggot

But dead that issue, time rip you like tissue

I humble pros who go thinking it can’t happen tonight
What better time than now? Make you a distant memory
My pedigree specialize in cheddar cheese

Alot of blood gushes around, my silencer crushes the sound
Jigged out patch your glazy suits, pimpin' hoes in daisy dukes
Beatnuts flip the most amazing loot
I love it
(Psycho Les)
What you love, losin' with a push and a shove
Who you think lent OJ the glove?
I love it
(JuJu)
When we bang hardcore
Make you slam on the hard floor
And do a backspin on the cardboard
I love it
(Psycho Les)
Show me your love
Jump from 20 stories above so I can write my name in your blood
I love it
(JuJu)
Why? Cause we own cribs, own whips and chrome rims
Bone skins with silicone tits
I love it (I know ya do, I know ya do)(Repeat 4x)
(Psycho Les)
You gettin' fidgety
Thinkin' of ways of gettin' rid of me
I scream on bitches like you
You ain't shit to me
I'll punch you while you talk on the phone
Walkin' alone
Park, even wait for you in front of your home
You should stop it
You can't even rhyme
Seen you front like a million times
Plus your knuckles ain't fuckin' with mine
Can't live without crossing the line
Busted my nine so money if you want it just follow the sign
(JuJu)
Huh, it's the beat programmer
Flip a beat
I'll flippin' beat ya sweet old gramma
(Psycho Les)
I'm in it 400%
Anybody gettin' it bent
Get hit with a block of cement
(JuJu)
Yo I stay high like a stewardess
Fuckin' with this, it's ludicrous
I just boned your bitch
Now she makin' me tuna fish
(Psycho Les)
I whistle you a rhyme offbeat
Try to listen everytime I speak
Bite my meat
(JuJu)
Oh, that was you?
Pickin' up the gold lobster
I thought you one for droppin' and poppin' the most caca
(Psycho Les)
Yo I spit it with the deli in ten
I don't really care who it offend
None of you niggas is payin' my rent
(JuJu)
Yo I hope you talk and lots of green
If not, why you stoppin' me?
Pullin' my arm, like a slot machine
(Psycho Les)
Yo take the money and run
Ju stay on some cowboy shit
Give me some whiskey and a fuckin' gun
I love it (I know ya do, I know ya do) (Repeat 4x)",https://genius.com/The-beatnuts-i-love-it-lyrics
Who’s Comin’ Wit Tha Shit Now,Take It or Squeeze It,2001,"Magnum!

My Glock will make the whole fucking block rumble
Y'all niggas need to watch who you approach in this jungle
See I ain't even got a pot to piss, watchin you homo niggas pop that Crys
Drop by me hangin out that rich
See if a nigga don't chop it off
Y'all niggas talk too much shit, y'all need to knock it off
Catch your mom comin off of the train
Put an ice-pick in the back of her brain, its that plain
I want everything or nothing at all
Give your (smash) a whatcha-ma-call
I give love when I shop at the mall
They always at your throat or down at your feet
Always actin like something is sweet
You don't know me homey
I'm lifeless, always gettin caught in a crisis
The only way out now is to write this
Everybody kiss my ass, cause I'm only flying business class
So if you can't afford it nigga, don't ask
If it ain't Psycho, its Juju, and if it ain't Juju it's Psycho
Who's comin' wit tha shit now!
If it ain't Juju, its Psycho, and if it ain't Psycho it's Juju
Who's comin' wit tha shit now!

Ayo, niggas wanna ban me like dice play
So I grab my nuts and tell 'em have a nice day
They wanna hate on me all day, talk shit like its okay
And my reply is no way Jose
You poppin' so much wool, I’m ready to say “Olay!”
We drop the illest joints, that gets no play
All these industry cats, can't stop the funk
So hit the deck when I turn this up and pop the trunk
And circulate, the state, like a trolly-car
And peep the party, people's hands up like volley-ball
It's Big Psych, makin big money stacks
Retaliate on you funny cats wit murder tracks
Like if it ain't Psycho, its Juju, and if it ain't Juju it's Psycho
Who's comin' wit tha shit now!
If it ain't Juju, its Psycho, and if it ain't Psycho it's Juju
Who's comin' wit tha shit now!

Head bob to the beat, put some rocks at your feet
On the block with a fleet, bass rattles the concrete
Spit heat like the summer, let it clap like thunder
I'm always in and out of the hood, politicin what's good
Let my pen write on paper, party in the skyscraper
Who's the amazing, Willie Stubz blazin the hazin
Hot like the mutha fuckin hell that I be raising
Pimp shorty short be like please don't deport me
My life story's well, I'm just out to get the glory
Three heavy-weights, on the tripple-beam
Its seems don't every pre-judge
They finally decompose in the mud

It’s Da Nuts,Take It or Squeeze It,2001,"(Little kid)
It's the Beatnuts
A world premier (2x)

What you thought, I couldn't afford another drink
So I went up to the bar, stole a bottle
Watch me slide through the crowd in place
To chill backstage, anybody acts strange
Smack them with the black gauge
I flow smooth to this, while you don't even know how to move to this
But it's the Beatnuts, we don't have to prove shit
Anything we drop is the shit, certified blazing
Hittin' honeys like Marie Jason
Bless and seven days at the Holiday's Inn
After each show, the telly is like a peepshow
Doggie steelo, is how we hit each Ho
If I don't get you now, I'mma gonna get you next tour
Shortie looking like she wants to explore
Shortie looking like she wants to have sex raw
Shortie looking like enough of that, enough of that
Dull as they seem none of that, you don't got a ride home
Call your mother back, it's like that
Follow the rules and later you can swallow the jewels
Bragging to your girlfriends
How you sucked it and I fucked it in the mini-chopper
Cause she just wanna have fun like Cyndi Lauper
Chorus:
It's the niggas that you play is hate to see
You know they run up in your girl from 1-2-3
It's the nuts (2x)
In the crib, in the club, and the SUV
It's the Shhh you wanna hear every place you be
It's the nuts (2x)

How much you wanna bet? I get as close as I wanna get
Anybody gets tough, see if I'm a threat
Catch me in the club sittin in the shadows, bottle of J.D
Surrounded by some bad ho's treat them bitches like bodyarmour
If there is beef in the club I shoot right through your body mama
Why everybody hates so much? It's real out here but I can only take so much
I'm everything you love to hate
You mad you the only one that fake (2x)
Chorus

Ha
Yo, what it is, what it is, can I touch this up
A smidgen yo like my addicts can I drug this up
Drift flow to be sporadic, strictly bombs and such
How much for these fanatics want the dome to the gut, gone to clutch
Watch how these chickens jump a double like dutch and then what
How these niggas walk and duck in their trucks (What's the drive?)
Yo, I'm gonna keep you cats on your toes, ah yo fuck the gun play
Just some niggas and ho's for some party and shit
La-di-da-di shit, my niggas lift the clip
My ladies lip the dick and that's it
Now the party goes cardiovascio, cermonial masteral
To keep that factual, keep that a hundred nuts
Bust them with whatever yo, show off the hook
You crooks just stand shook, blow you niggas to bits
If you witnessed the fits, strictly kick the hits
On and on the shit, like what

- Eh, say what?
How you going to enjoy good music without good marihuana?!)
No doubt
The World F...
3CF Mob kid

It's the crook with the shit, look on your turntable
Amped like a fuse to burn down your whole label
Now niggas wanna do me in but aren't able
Stressin themselves out while I remain stable
Freak flows let opponents know
That I combat with gats to delete my foes
Gots to get money kid you know how it goes
And I'm still livin foul, even stickin up hoes

Beatnuts comin at you with that filthy skunk
Ain't another brother kickin fat beats with spunk
Duck tried to test me, who could the best be?
Psycho make you Dizzy Gillespie
Spin that ass like a DJ table
Forth and back, spark a Phil', then mack, black
Whether ( ? ) or ( ? ) it's all good
I know you wish you could

Get funky one time for your mind, oh yeah
Throw your hands in the air like you just don't care
Wave em round and round, to the front and back
World Famous in the house, catch a heart attack

Catch a heart attack, muthafucka, push the button
Cause you've fallen and you can't get up all of a sudden
You're stuck on the floor, hip-hop crazy raw
While you niggas be singin that bullshit (bullshit)

You got the blues, the Kool is your saviour
Down to daze ya, but the Nuts wanna blaze ya
Raise ya, give you junk that juice that was major
(Funky)
(And ya don't stop)
Come on
Comin' from the soul, the heart is the funk spot
Diggin' through shit that I found out in the park lot
Talk not, bustin' crazy shots at the dome, squeeze
Ju come down, spray these niggas with that funk, please

Somebody said you was looking for static G
Those who try to play me close could die tragically
I got a merciless flow that's emphatically
Fatal, it attacks the brain automatically
Unleasing lyrical wrath to leave you open
Crews that choose to bite might find yourself soakin
Dirty and low, yo fuck what the pope says
I'm tryin' to get money like Felipe Lopez
(Get funky)

So what's that fat shit you be freakin to?
Hey yo, who the fuck you think that we be speakin to?
Keepin you open like a suitcase
Now you taste the Psycho fuckin bass in your face

With a 1-2-3, the 3, the 2-1
Only type ( ? ) preacher could eat his nun
Hun, sit on the wood as the drum
Trips, causin turbulence on your dumb
Tits, act like you recognize daddy
Run papi chu, get what you never had, he
Roll a fattie, backseat of a Caddy
Cause it's all good
I know you wish you could
(Get funky)

Brothers and sisters, check the Nuts status
Kool not the baddest but at time rhyme the fattest
Maddest anger on the remix
Re-fix kicks, got your number one picks
Chicks want the licks cause of the facial
You're interracial, no matter, I'ma date yo
Hit your fuckin neck with that shit we drop
Beatnuts turn it out and you don't, don't stop
Like that

Like that, tha-tha-tha-that
Fuck go off the top, let's go off the bat
The Junkyard nigga represent if you want me
Scream one time, a-get funky

Psycho Les:
To fiends my product be their drug
When they see me they give me a pound and a bear hug
Solute and bud, never sober
Nigga Ju scooped me up (in what?) in the black Nova
When we link up, we throw shots, drink up
We conversate in the background bangin'
Is a funky break, with my arm hangin'
Middle finger to State Troop and leave them behind me
Going 90 down the express way, fuck Carlito
Gonna do it the Big Ju and Les way
Beatnuts, got a plan that's brilliant
Gonna blow up the safe that holds up our building
JuJu:
Yo here’s the key son, money and power they’re synonymous
So I'm a take mine and form a fortune that be bottomless
Yo never shot a miss, to lose is our the question
Your life could be taken as quick as a suggestion
Killing is deep, well lavishly orchestrated, I hate it
Stated, that I'm never be forgotten
And you still couldn't find an MC that's more rotten
Hook:
Strategicly we maintain in all reality
Live with the guns to cover all the technicalitites
And crush the falises taht frontin' is legit cause
(real niggas don't talk shit) (X2)
Psycho Les:
Yo dun, there's money to swipe, the juice come thicker
Then Sunny Delight, and my leather black seat reclines
So I can spin around; Pull down the blinds, crack open the wines
My click holds serious faces
And only crack smiles when I pull the briefcases
Out the closet, in the middle of the process, even if I know you
You get shot for spreading gossip
To niggas I don't associate with, if I don't blast your head off
I'll simply break it
Aluminum batted, melon splattered, so unique
Now who the FUCK wanna critique
JuJu:
Yeah it's lovely, yeah man it's lovely indeed (it is lovely)
Bubbly off the Heiny and weed, you can't live
You be lucky if I let you breath
If it ain't about profit nigga I can't see
Try not to blow my high with conversation
Conflict my lead to many assassinations
Blunted in a black Sudan with two Hatians (watching)
While the D's hemmed up these Jamacains, thinkin'
How we gonna carry your ass, and where the FUCK niggas
Gonna bury your ass; See it's over
I could never let that go, say who gotta let niggas know?

Put the crowd sip and wake em up make em' come
Drop a beat make em fuckin' like when I take a slumb
Okay, shorty's actin tough we don't wanna stuff em

Make you feel your career's a mishap
Ya'll fake men, really what you need is a bitchslap
Unattach, carry guns to mismatch
And all fully loaded just waitin' to dispatch
But with this track, I'm closin' a big gap
The truth will unfold, young and old will dig that
When I spit that, you feel the pain
I make niggas uptight like a chair on a plane
I'm pissed off like a bear on a chain

Story,Intoxicated Demons: The EP,1993.0,"(“Here’s a little story I got to tell…”)

I met this girl, she was Miss Alabama
“Hello, come in my room, drop to your knees, bitch” mama mellow
She said “a’ight”, grabbed the Dutchie, sucked it
I aimed at her twat with my dick and cold fucked it
“UNH”, that’s all ya heard when I pushed it in
Did her so good, the bitch wanted children
I said, “No, no, baby, it’s not like that”
I coulda sworn she was a DJ how she was scratchin’ my back
Deep throats, wet licks to the head
The next thing you know, she wanna go to … goddamn!
There I was, layin’ with my 9 inch
Crazy fat, crazy thick, like the NYNEX pages
She wanted to go through the Beatnuts stages
Popped off her bra, POW, they were outrageous
Twenty pounds each and my luck, two watermelons
Bigger than Sandra’s, but smaller than Helen’s
Yow, I do ‘em well so they catch orgasms
At least 20 minutes before I splash ‘em—BOOM!
Rode it like a bike, my dick was the peg
She wanted doggystyle so I humped her leg
Pissed on the carpet, shitted by the door
Psycho Les is out, you don’t wanna hear no more
It’s like that y’all (that y’all), it’s like that y’all (that y’all)
The hooker put scratches on my back y’all (back y’all)
(“Here’s a little story I got to tell…”)

We’re downtown bound with Mark makin’ tracks
In the Max’, kickin’ facts
The Willie Bobo, about the hoe strolls we’ve been to
Then I looked out the window
“Hola, senorita—or is it senora?
Miss or Mrs, I still got somethin’ for ya”
Wasted no time with the small talk, no frontin’
Picked her straight up like a nigga out in Compton
I says, “What crib we goin’ to—your one or my one?”
She said, “Who needs a bed? This car’s just fine, son”
Mark tried to step when the bitch grabbed my penis
She said, “Don’t leave, honey bun, you gotta see this”
Kicked off her panties, slid back in the recliner
Opened up her legs and said, “Welcome to the diner”
Took a whiff, shit smelled kosher
Loaded up my banger, aimed it then I smoked her—BOOM!
Sucked her tits and I pounded her clit so
She made noise like chinks in Jiu-Jitsu
Ooh, you’re daddy long dick, she really started screamin’
So I muffled up her mouth with some semen
It’s like this y’all (this y’all), like this y’all (this y’all)
I bust a Beatnut then I take a piss y’all (piss y’all)
(“Here’s a little story I got to tell…”)

It really don’t matter ‘cause to me it means nothin’
Next time I’m feelin’ rough, I’ll just snuff him

Kill the president, kill him, kill him, fuck him",https://genius.com/The-beatnuts-story-lyrics

Ju got the canyon, Les the grenade launcher
I blaze ghanga like Jamaicans in Kingston
And shit on you and leave you stinkin
Light a match
U don't want it don't want it

I don't love hoes who catch me on the Ave with a snub nose
Late night ridin a bike watchin for po po
At a red light right in plain sight
On a summer on the low on the dead night
Y'all niggas don't want it with us
And they ain't really shit to discuss
All that shit you be spittin', it sucks
Step to you with the steel out
Juju ain't the type of cat you wanna feel out

Catch you with the cross bow
Right through your torso

Before I wack em I crack a cold pepsi
Click back all leave the space messy

Blowin guns like Jesse
Pulled my Glock out who wanna test me
I feel like the devil just possessed me
Burn more weed, I'm moving at hyper speed
Always carry two knives with me
For y'all niggas who be trying to hate

You know these are the records you be dyin to make
Think you're hot nigga yeah right
Hot in the ass fuck around get shot in the ass

Eat at the spot like Pac you could believe it or not
In the streets in the drop you know my boys is hot
We spit fireballs you in my click, I'mma die for yours
Hammer quipped we die for the strips defy the law
We the squad that do the job and beat the charge
A gold T with a whole key will beat the job
You never know when you're bout to go
You never know when you're about to blow
Niggas get locked when the block is slow
On my pops we gonna pop the Mo
Pop the Crys and cock is clicked
Til Seis get killed by the apocalypse
Ain't no stoppin this
We splurgin and mergin
Icein up the verse so nice they call me surgeon
Fuck what they heard twin
We the truth smoke weed on the roof
Puff live on the deuce get live off the 1-5-1 proof
You never know this ain't a rapper bein phony
With the white gold and big boulders and cuban zircony
Frontin like you don't know me, homey
This scene is getting ugly

The smells of the ghetto, and especially the sounds of the ghetto, you know?""

Yo....my nigga JuJu what's up baby?
(Psycho Les, Psycho Les)
(JuJu, JuJu)
Let's get this money, let's get hung ya na'mean? (big thugs, big thugs)
Niggas crazy man!

I'd rather die like a man and live a coward life
At a night moving the fangs the crooked up and powered white
You know me, I was OT
Getting it lo' key, remembering what old timers told me
The first law you wanna hold heat burst yours
Props to seek have you sleeping in hurst doors
The conversation indicated props are sharp
He said he never hold many cause it might be marked
It's like this give me mine or I'm a take what's yours
Make love war, spray up doors, say no more
Instead of picking weight up more, I'm picking mic's up
Lounging on my mothers sofa, kicking my Nike's up
Like Koobi Agi who could stop me
Your coke is doodle papi
My people said they need they cash back, cash that son
I caught a flash back the crimes and the whip times change
Niggas shine me, I sparkle like a diamond ring

YOU CRAZY, thinking you gonna stop the rule (Psycho Les, Psycho Les)
TOO LATE, we get your heart rate out control (JuJu, JuJu)
THINK BIG, now live bigger baby that's the goal
And maybe a little later, WE'LL BE HOT TO HOLD
YOU CRAZY, thinking you gonna stop the rule
TOO LATE, we get your heart rate out control
Here's my outlook, bitches put out with no output
Cause see a little later, WE'LL BE HOT TO HOLD

Let me get a EQ (inaudible) up, beats is clear
You say you flipping pies, you must work at a pizzeria
No need to fear, The Nuts is here
And it's about to be off the da hook this year
Let the buzz in your ear, like the fuzz in your rear
Every time you see me, I'm guzzling beer
Blazing them trees, counting up gee's
Old school on the pro to bouncing a beat
What's my name? (He said) You know da game? (You fine)
Every time I swing my fists I hit right (Right)
The professional boxer, knock you out of ox-y-gen
Now you out the game, ob-so-lete
Hit you wit the shit you ain't used TA
And (inaudible) snakes all in my head like Medusa
But I won't let them get the best of me
You can smell what I'm cooking but you can't have the recipe


Look homes, I'm trying uplift this shit
Make history, something for the kids and shit
Put my heart in my music for as long as I live
Nigga the sound of the ghetto coming out of the crib
Hard-core to art form bigger than rap
All I know is that a lot of new niggas in crack
Sounding like dummies man niggas should act
It's wrong and where I come from biting is wack
Maybe that's why niggas never walk through the hood
They ask, there intentions never been any good
Little bitch ass niggas if I catch them I would
Put my foot up they ass man as far as I could

Risk they freedom, and buck back at the poor life
Nothin's guaranteed like when you roll dice
Keep your eyes open, with no time to snooze
No time to lose, no time to choose

The logo's a target for any hip-hop cabeza
That wanna purchase it, pop it in your CD
And get thoughts (I'm a murderous...)

It's unbelievable what niggas gotta do to survive
If you scared better keep it inside
Guarantee you I'm a eat you alive
There's no where to run, no where to hide

Ay yo, this is that shit, that thugs love rockin
This is that shit that have your neighbors knockin

They next smash, and collect cash, and get sex fast, and get passed
Day by day I, pray, under the grey skies, enough play time
Let's get serious, like Jermaine Jackson (yeah)
And prepare for the main attraction

Make an LP for beers and chips, makin everyone who hears it flip
Catch a contact, feel this shit

Thinkin’ ’Bout Cash,Stone Crazy,1997,"People are so busy listening to the music
They don’t see what’s going on right under their very feet
Below the ground…

Ha…yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together
Screwball, Beatnuts collaboration
Be a screw to a ball and a beat to a nut, what
Check it, be a screw to a ball and a beat to a nut, what

Who’s the culprit? No shame in the game
Feel the pain but my rhymes get you numb like cocaine
It’s the black rose, the life I chose
Getting hoes, pushing cum right out they nose
Check the visuals, kid, as I illustrate, flow with hate
I suffer but never get enough of this ghetto livin’
Can’t give in, gotta get in where you fit in
Black blood within arm, picture which is written
Gotsta spill the beans, I’m lurkin’ out in Queens
Where niggas carry submachines under their jeans
Pumpin’ heems, Jake separate into teams
Flashlight beams, they spotty, K-9’s, pistol-grip shotties
G-locks while thugs carry rocks in their Reeboks
See lots of what’s going on, holding on
But that’s the last straw, I can’t take it no more
The world is sick and Queensbridge got the cure
Word up (Queensbridge and Corona)
Check it…

If you thinkin’ ‘bout cash, then you’re reading my mind
If you thinkin’ ‘bout cash, then you reading my mind
To all you jum jugglers, pimp hustlers, murderers
Cops who’s corrupting us, life of crime
If you thinkin’ ‘bout cash, then you’re reading my mind
If you thinkin’ ‘bout cash, then you’re reading my mind

Yo, how the fuck you gon’ do what I do? You ain’t me
You niggas hate me, you niggas keep your guns on safety
And lately, you fuckin’ with my nerves and shit
With the way y’all been fuckin’ up my work and shit
You heard right, my team put it on dirt bike
Money hungry Germans with no life who gun fight
We love this country in the worst way
We gon’ bleed the bitch, corner to corner, Friday to Thursday
Jump off the highway when you see ten bikes
Poppin’ wheelies from Corona to Washington Heights
(You heard right) fuckin’ up my money ain’t cool
Now I gotta lift you, you know this game got rules
Yo, Po, what’s up? Tell me what’s on your mind, son
Word…

Check it, I’m going all out, no doubt, let me begin
Time to release the beast that rages within
I flips the script, I rip rhymes like none other
This is for my niggas, they buckwild for my brother
They’ve been fiendin’, while I was sitting back schemin’
Meditatin’, 9-7, fuck a waitin’
A lotta niggas might seem rough
But they’re a cream puff underneath that gangsta lean stuff
I’m the authentic, come check my lyrics
Ain’t no gimmicks or record company image
Rappers get blown up trying to take me out
I bust ‘em open and make all their flavor leak out
My rhymes are razor sharp, nothin’ to play with
The beats are nuts, so you critics can’t say shit

Light the lah, we got mad trees (roll beez)
Lifted, in a cypher of parolees (the clique)
Crazy sick, done visit
The wrong place at the wrong time and catch blizzard
Approximately 20 deep, Spanish kids
Tall boys are mannequins, Jake start panickin’
Calling in for backup, useless
Pigs get smacked up, UH, left toothless
Cut off their walkie talkie conversation
I’m a big figure, you a crab nigga, that’s the situation
Pull out on your ass like a futon, crush you like a crouton
Bag you like Louis Vuitton (my shit)
Tremble the walls of your neighbor
Transaction, pushing more keys than Paul Schaffer
Set for action, smashing chickens with fat culos
Beatnuts and Screwball here to do y’all
Like that, baby—what

And even if you don't know me, you know I'm someone importante
I love raps since 
Roxanne Shanté
Now it's time to throw me in the mix with Beyonce
Crazy in love for the Golden Platty
Here's a drink toast up and light a fatty
I had to roll around the block because shorty had a fatty
Take a second look looking sporty in the Caddie
So fresh and so bling mang, doing the damn thing mang
We pack those metal things that ricochet like bing bang
I sling slang for a paycheck with the same tec
And even if I wasn't a trainwreck
I couldn't fall off track, I'm all that, fallback
Chu ch blow! ?caldat?, lines is busy call back
I'm very busy in fact, all you haters in the back
It's a big disgrace
You need to do like Kanye and fix your face

You buggin, mean muggin, you must be buggin'
You buggin, mean muggin, you must be buggin'
You buggin, mean muggin, you must be buggin'
You buggin, mean muggin, you must be buggin'

You're too corny man, you're too ?von dutch?
I'll show you how to smash it up
Cause homie if i'm not popping the trunk, i'm popping the clutch
It's Junkyard the all-time great
The one with the uncanny ability to flip all breaks
This year we going to do what it takes
And that includes beating niggas down and extorting they cake
It's our time, we overdue
The streets is starving for this shit so we bringing it through
I spit heat like I'm supposed to do
And that's for you and anybody that's close to you
It's Beatnuts la crème de la crème
If shorty acts up then you know i'm going to bend her friend
From her mouth straight to her rearend, then back again
I put it down like that boy again and again

I been blessed with a gift it's only natural floss
That's why they call me el jefe, head honcho, big boss
Fact remains I been in this game since day one
They call me Hot Cool & Vicious with my rhyme and my tongue
Just for fun I talk shit to see the expression on your face
But then it turns into business when I start rocking the place
Once again I'm 
Fantastic,

She was with it, giving me signals to hit it

Fluid,Unreleased Material EP,UnKnown,"	BOOM!

I take a stick of dynamite and put it to my mouth
Light it up, then I blast off like Alf
I be off (off) into another world
Got no time to be strapped to a freaking girl
?Blood stones? I pop, let 'em fizz out on top
On my lizard tounge like a donk with the zert
I hung to the like break of dawn
Six-packs for the 'Nuts leave the baker

I want to get wrapped in the sheets so I can sleep or sleepwalk
Mumble when I speak, but when I freak I speak talk
Get married to Juana, dip for my oink
Always on point to bumrush my joint
See the party can't last with the glass on the vineyard
So I put some yellow liquid and some dump on the menu
One two, to the like one two, my vision's hazy
Don't test me now, this paper's got me crazy

Ayo you be buggin' off the styles I be freaking
Dusted, keep you in a daze when I'm speaking
Stutter to be butter, but if you want I make it milky
A twenty bag of chocolate and a blunt, is you with me? (Yeah!)
Blowing smoke like a dragon, my mouth is dry and my eyes is sagging
So I flew, cause I felt I could do it
Do a dog, 40 ounce and fluid
	And fluid, and fluid
Puff a cloud and drink the fluid
	Puff here, puff there
	World famous Beatnuts puff everywhere!

Stimulation, feel the junkie sensation
It keeps the funk in rotation
Sluggards you're moving slow
Take a hit and act like you know
Now I'm open for business, call a hon with the quickness
To get some physical fitness on
Gettin' that all night long
Intoxicated Demons in the house, I'm gone

It's like a blast to my brain when I trip
Those lights and the sights at night make me flip
And then I want to slip to the magic kingdom
Some bitches in the stable, *lyrics played backwards* raid 'em
Cause I can make a movie with a sis or a buddy
And I'm a eat the cake no matter if it's chubby
Run up the line, double time, I'm ready
And I'm a get your gas chick like my name was Geddy

Girl, want to pull a cloud?
Pass it around the crowd when the music's loud
Can't talk, you don't want to see me walk
Great minds as I fail in front of the park
I don't know what's going on
I feel upside down like a Pharcyde song
See keeps on buzzing me
When I'm through it, puffing and swimming in fluid
	And fluid, and fluid
Puff a cloud and drink the fluid
	Puff here, puff there
	World famous Beatnuts puff everywhere!",https://genius.com/The-beatnuts-fluid-lyrics
Originate,The Originators,UnKnown,"(I originate)	--] Greg Nice

It started off one '89 morning
Prepared to bumrush this spot without warning
Dufflebagged up, we was there to conduct
Our bidness, clear it and never leave a eye witness
Barry White triplets, I'm grabbin em
Plus the Eddie Floyd Stax album in the back by the bathroom
Knowin all this shit no one knows
Way before radio played ""Throw them bo's""
We was out there gettin em
Beats, plus spittin em
Bars, I'm Large, about the streets, I'm hittin em
Junkyard Psycho style
Keep them chickens from back there because they might go wild
Wants to get quick dose of this, try on ferocious
Blow and pow like 4th of July explosives
30 day notices gettin sent out
To all you greaseball rappers, this is world renowned
(I originate)

It's the originator
(Who got the funk?) Not the imitator
You just a french fry, I'm a hot potato
Big Psych, the drunken operator
Computer data broadcastin live from the buddha chamber
Future Flavas, so turn it up
Aiyo, that new Beatnuts shit is burnin up
Charts across the global, my vocal's
Like a yodel, Large Pro showed up
With three plates of soul food
Funk tracks, on point like thumb tacks
It's the raw, baby, bangin out of drum pads
Like oh, shorty asked me if I sniff blow
I told her hell no, I just puff 'dro
What's my muthafuckin name - Psycho
Junkyard and my nigga Large Pro
-fessor break it down like
(I originate)

It's Big Ju, I come through with the final component
Loaded and ready, just right for the moment
Serve it up raw, uncut and quite potent
Niggas still sleep with the do' and lights open
Me I dig deep, real deep in the earth
Find the right records, be freakin em first
Some say it's an addiction, some say it's a curse
I'm married to this beat shit for better or worse
I hustle till the work is gone
Go in the booth, get on the mic, go bezerk, it's on
Then whip up the perfect song
Cause really, if it ain't about the music then the shit's just wrong",https://genius.com/The-beatnuts-originate-lyrics

My man L, E-S is in the house
Beatnuts are the best, you know we're in the house

Third of the trio, is in the house
And I'm about to flow, and turn it out
So here we here we go (Fashion Ju and Les I make a third of the trio!)
Check it out
Pa-pa-pa-presto magilla, ya slim gorilla
Ya baby monkey - Don Fashioney gets funky
On the or, F or, a big score - better believe Kool Fash has m-met more
I'm going d-d-d-d-deep with styles so s-sweet
We roll up into your van or catch when ya sleep
Slurred some words, through with a stutter
So smooth on the horns, I was the real b-b-butter baby
No D-I-S respect I meant but with enough low flows, who's ???lent
Catch my scent, fuck a wave
That ass of a hey or wind up in a grave (grip-a-grip-a-grave!)
Soft and shallow, but never hollow
Eat up tried swallow but fail to follow
The O-R-I-ginator, who's greater? Huh, tip the waiter? I'll see you later (later!)
Chorus
Fiddly fi, fiddly fy, fiddly fo, fiddly fum X2
Fashion, Ju, and Les, I make a third of the trio
Fiddly fi, fo fum - ha! Call me famous
Now who can blame us, for kicking anus (World Famous)
So mic check 1, 2, effects I run through
Diggity did what I done, not the one little son, you
Copy the cat that, started the fat track
D-d-drop the dreads from the head now do that jack
Sex appealing and what I'm feeling
You can feel on the alarm but no woman I'm stealing
I'm not a crima-nim-minal, that's what I said in the first short
But I smoke Joes and make dough as a sport
So hop off James, you no names you can't win
Cause if you fuck with Kool Fash, diggity Das - the end
Chorus
Fiddly fi, fiddly fy, fiddly fo, fiddly fum X2
Fashion, Ju, and Les, I make a third of the trio
I seen my man Kico, and got Purrico
Then hit the slopes with little hops and Chico
Crack! The biddy iddy up to consume
A crazy hit of that boom without doom in my room
But knock knock, who's there? Hope it ain't a burglar
Lucky me, it's my bin-oys with Masta and Sugar
Now time for some chick stick, a 40 and picnic
Got the ? herb, but what chick will I get with
Femme fatale, slim dim and figure
Got my hand on the trigger, if she has nigga
So sleep on this get slapped like a miss
I drop punks pull out dilack and piss
Kool, Ass Fa-na-na-fashion
Peace, I'm ghost, that's all - I'm done
Check it out, a little bad-da-da-ass track, bad-da-da-ass track

U Suckers Ain’t,UnKnown,1994.0,"Hey yo, my lyrics are terror kid
They roll like thunder
From the murderous mouth that I hold the mic under
Punks wonder, and try to figure out where I'm comin' from
Talkin' like they got mad game but ain't runnin' none
A street soldier slingin' dope or pushin' spots
Hang with live niggas, go to war over city blocks
The drug game is like ill, ain't no way to stop it
Hustle til I get my fill but let me change the topic
Triple rhyme that's hard leaves a nigga broke
Sexin' while I puff mad blunts havin' bitches choke
I be movin' like a killer in smooth 
Rockin' Timberlands, ski hats and goose coats
Droppin' flava over grooves that be bumpin'
Lightin' niggas up when we would try to say somethin'
So step to your business kid and stop frontin'
(Suckers don't like me cause you're all about nothin')
(We came here) (Just to say a little somethin')
(You suckers don't like me cause you're all about nothin')

(You suckers don't like me cause you're all about nothin')

Don't sweat it, I bust a flow that tastes like gravy
You're crazy imaginin' you can phase me
Amaze me baby how your comeback was  that
You get the oohs I refuse to get with that
I'm wicked and I get lifted like a picket
Sign, when I design a way to stick it
I'm, gonna do what I said I was
Gonna do, and rock your ass for hours
 and one in the back
Took ya back, here's my shank, so just walk the plank
I gotta thank all my peeps from the jump that were with me
Hump the world's famous, one time fuckin' hit me
Uh! Back in the place with the funk shit
Took a strong hit so you can function
Black! Act like you know who's winnin'
Kick a psychedelic flow and be ghosts like linen

Yo the shit I come up with it, it always fucking has it
Like a back spasm or crazy orgasm
Kicking on back, weed sacks I pull
Tote some fucking smoke now my lungs are full
Pffff… I let it out flow on to the next
Now my special effects when I flex gives me sex
X marks the spot, intox like a demon
She's schemin' tryin' to get a shot of my semen
Dreamin' about some soul or that Beatnut funk
Now I'm muggin' off that dust and I'm high-grade skunk
Punk your pop chump, come on don't try to riff
Cuz ya fuck around (and get pushed off a cliff)
Spliff, yeah I roll 'em, down some Amaretto
Got the Tims and Girbauds with the village-look leather
Whatever you do, don't forget the name
Let's cut that shit and tell 'em why we came

Call me Les Dibiase, I'm Psycho like a Nazi
Playin with a hottie while you home playin Yazzy
Camilo on the 1's and 2's movin the party
That's when the waitress brought a Kamikaze
I was like, ""No! Pass the Courvoisi""
10 minutes later cerveza under the meza
She was horny for the pony, so I had to bless her
I shot sperm in her perm, I don't have to tell you
I was like, ""May the power of Psych compel you""
I'm stone crazier than any nigga from Bellview
I know you see my monster truck in your rear view
Musically I'mma always be the shit
I'm not only the producer, I'm the nigga that spit

We keep diggin in the crates (back to back)
Hittin state after state (back to back)
We keep rippin these shows (back to back)
We keep spittin these flows (back to back)
Coppin drug after drug (back to back)
Rockin club after club (back to back)
Five million dollar cribs (back to back)
And all we do is make hits (back to back)

Hip-hop cats, they know I'm the nutty one
They don't wanna buy tracks, they just wanna study them
Pull you out the hat like (Hey!) you the lucky one
Everything classical, fuck the money, son
I got this bad chick uptown, she's my slutty hon
Even on her period we can still have some bloody fun
Nuts is back, so spread the rumor
Rock this in your set and be a happy consumer
Perfect for a bus or a train commuter
(D-d-)download if you in front of a computer
Spark the buddha, ""Get out the way bitch,"" like Luda
Pull up to Wet Willy's on a scooter
Who the - fuck wan test Psych Les, QU's finest
Once the king puts his thing in the nappy

Treat$,The Spot Remix EP,1998,"This is only the beginning that ain't got no end, nigga
Only the beginning, baby
This is only the beginning that ain't got no end

Let off a couple, for all my niggas startin trouble
Souls are lost up in the shuffle, now apocalypse will bubble
When the sky begins to crumble I'll exist amongst the galaxy
The suns, the stars, the moons, in its universal majesty
Simply verbal mastery is absurd when I spit this
This lyricist stay on mad judge and DA's shitlist
They try to prosecute me but I murk they only witness
Now go and get your critics, they favorite rappers and mimicks
While I leave em with a slitted wrist, stick up em at they tickets
With my niggas Psycho Les and Corona don nigga JuJu
My style move crowds like ( ? ) in Honolulu
Holdin mics like how the Source is, ram a fork through your fortress
Nogoodus be victorious, you other rappers get off it

It's the narc'ie, taggin up places with a sharpie
Faces in the dark be blazin ( ? )
When they see us, World's Famous Beatnuts, they greet us
Honeys wanna meet us, duckies try to defeat us
But that's Impossible like a Mission Tom Cruise couldn't even accomplish
I'm leavin after I bomb this
Properly, bring the noise to your property
You probably call the cops on me, it's gotta be
The Beatnuts if it's rare to the ear
This year and every year, we gettin props everywhere
I don't fuckin care what you claim hip-hop is
My production bounce pretty like brown titties that are topless
It's the horniest, Psycho bulgin
Son be the corniest like Michael Bolton

...part of me probably
Cause a catastrophy, me and my faculty
Actually it was extinct till when we linked
And to think these bitches pack millies in the mix
Makes me proud to be aloud and speak on how
And what and like Rakim I'm movin the crowd
I hold my gun with a psychotic grin, my metropolis
Populates a gang of arsonists
Build like a architect, the street publicist
Hey yo, this is the issue
I wet bodies and rip tissues, my niggas miss you
As I get hold a few things be gettin harder
Many kids be gettin larger but I'm keepin my guards up
To protect myself from a wealthy environment
Not to face my dark side is my first assignment
But I can't face that with a mack or a squaw
It takes myself and my mind to take charge
But since I'm a outcast, no American Dream
Brains to work, cause I'ma search for a scheme
I hang with a gun cause everyone has one
I move along with the world cause there be no re-runs
Nigga

You know the circumstance said to me: You don't stand a chance
I cause a avalance to put you in a ambulance
You lost sight, makin the moves you frostbite
Same cowards that be duckin to the sounds of exhaust pipes
Scared to tell, paranoid in this ghetto life
Razor blade, gunplay is how they settle fights
We into witchcraft, quick cats, they flip fast
Stocking cap, facin a gun through a thick class
The bankteller make you richer than a gram seller
You in the jam, fella, doin time like Mandela
But check the consequence, ain't too late to switch plans
They say I'm broke but in my mind I'm a rich man
The way I strike you recognize that you need time
Don't need no psychics, through your eyes I can read mines
While you feed swine, while you breathe wine, while you eat crime
I take the time to make rhymes to make my seeds shine
With efficient flows, so duck when the pistol blows

Let Off A Couple ll
( *cut up* )
(Let off a couple) --> Psycho Les

I'm into stackin papers, I'm smackin fakers if they rappin haters
I'm jackin bakers takin dough plus I'm crackin acres
My throughts are intricate, magnificient, significant
Infinite spittin it on behalf of those are innocent
My tongue's a instrument, makin my larynx a clarinet
Never to fumble or stumble, stayin away from arrogance
The mic's a sacrament, I bring to life while you surrogate
Lyrics are holy, I write this poetry in arabics
So let's get head up, dead up, step up and you get wet up
Up in a set up, you bleed for real, forget the ketchup
And you can tell I'm proper, rap the planet while you sellin copper
You cross my path I have you hangin from a helicopter
Step in my world but I ain't down with hittin Blondie
Livin with zombies got me starvin hungry like if I was Ghandi
You try to set it, yo, I regret it, I'm fly poetic
You die pathetic cause you sweeter than a diabetic
Lyric historian, crown valet victorian
Rap in memoriam, been doin it since the auditorium
Visionary, missionary, you get the picture scary
Squish you like berries, have your name in the obituary

We got no feelings for ya
We're breakin hearts, choppin breaks apart
Technically we grab you with the state of art
Let it start, pause your camcorder
I fear we slam harder with this lyrical manslaughter

Hey yo, I stay hustlin, bustin, I'm disgustin
Only got a few friends and I don't even trust them
Those cats who wanna see power I'm gonna crush em
Affiliated, got all the work flowin through custom
Frankly, better make your mark and enforce it
Look at me, the end of my sleeves remain frosted
I lost it, took the ball and ran when they tossed it
Blind shit, not even care how much it costed

( ? ) undercover and judges, druggin is rugged
Jailtime walks in expensive halls
Fast calls, killers and mad weight for high stakes
Snitches behind gates will become shark bait
Train pitch, you on my hit list, public enemy, different identity
A chameleon towards civiliance
Warfare political government affairs
A madman who declares a share
A piece of the action, a percent, yo, you gotta pay rent
Or catch dent and facial gat imprints
Man, even our señoritas be carryin' heaters
Now how you gon' beat us or delete us
You bunch of half-way achievers
By ( ? ) apartment leases the dough increases
Out of this world contact just like ( ? )
See, we keep pieces strapped on the waistline
But too many jokers in the world of crime so now I keep mine
And the sh... never mind, forget that
Don't even sweat that

Hardcore to the middle
Big Jus, Psycho Les & Skribble
A nigga really stars fallout
And leave the rap game cripple
Beatnuts forever, die hard, you know the model
Shut the hell up then and buy another bottle
Get the party started correct-

Keep it smooth like pearl jam bugs
Make you fiend like drugs
Scheme like thugs with  tight mobs
We pitfight all bitches that call us scrubs
Triple one's on my back
??? guns on my chest
Beatnuts stay hot to death
Fool for the chef
Who do the best ? Call me your highness
Cause when you find this I'm probably blinder than the smoke	
Chillin'in miami drinkin heinys on the ???
Yo the streets are wild, I never let'em see me smile

I'm patient but believe I got them hammers on call
Cause as soon as I feel my back touch the wall
The music gon' stop and everybody gonna crawl
And the sheet rock and body parts start to fall
It's madness, Niggas wanna push and push
Till the torch comes out and turn their brain to mush
I'm a top shelf nigga burning Cali kush
In a mink with some tangerine Nikes I'm like swoosh
So many women, I don't gotta tell y'all shit
It's a given you crunchy I'm livin', but Ju's gonna do his thing
Diamonds clear blue in this ring, like thirty two in this ring
And the cash flow, just as sure as the grass grow
My hussle is global and I'm traveling fast yo
First class, grippin' that Izod
Drinkin' like my god, reclining with the forty gig Ipod

Whatcha gonna do when there is madness
Madness, madness baby, madness, madness
Whatcha gonna do when there is madness
Madness, madness, madness, madness

Madness, come on
Hey yo, niggas start thumpin', I'm breaking it up
Big mouths on the side instigating it up
Big Psych never ever ever fakin' the funk
An yo its been a long time now I'm makin' it up
I smell somethin' in the eir someone's blazin' it up
I'm feeling shorty right there the way she's shakin' it up
For my hustlers on the grind keep cakin' it up
Coppin' pounds, chop it down and weighin' it up
This is madness (madness) to make you get up
This is madness (madness) new keep your head up
I got my peoples on the streets waiting for the beats again
I'm hungry for your plate and I'm back to eat again
So finish up your food before I reach your table
And if you have a problem you gon' be disabled
Make you hot under the collar when I hop out the Impala
Put the Glock to your cara and pop you with a bala

I wanna fuck, drink beer, and smoke some shit!
Fuck, drink beer, and smoke some shit!
Who up in this piece?

A bunch of thug vandals, runnin drug scandals
Pullin hons by their love handles
Take their funds, mug their man too
Chop their head off, put it on the mantle
Beats programmed to stand you and slam you
(Wicked man!) Yeah son, that's the ticket
Nuts gettin funkier than Wilson Pickett
Watch me kick it, Grand Imperial lunatic
Get the dough, set the show, wet a hoe with my super dick
Nut, then I got ghost
You got ta be clean in between, not gross
I bust the illy style your ears ain't used to
The Nuts make the music for the crowd to get loose to
So honeys in the house if you're hot, lift your blouse
Brothers if you're thirsty, crack the forty ounce
Beats I smack em out the stadium, I never bunted
I go all night, you got a light, let's get blunted
Light up, pass it, so I can puff
You can't get enough of the rugged and rough
Anti-pop, we ain't singin like klutz
Check it, World's (World's) Famous (Famous) Beat (Beat) Ugh

Well it's the Junkyard nigga with the funk flow screamin
Hardcore, crazy bad breath like a demon
Retarded from birth, see, I ain't got no class
I used to fart in church and tell the preacher kiss my ass
Freakin mad styles catchin seizures, yo
It's the Psycho Dwarf killer with a Cesar, bro
Ugly like shit, my style's crooked
Any piece of ass I ever got is cause I took it
Yo, I'm invisible, niggas can't see me, kid
I did a short bid and came out cock diesel, kid
Junkyard JuJu, so you know
Strap full metal jacket every fuckin place I go
So play Dionne Warwick's song and Walk On By
Or maybe stick around for a Columbian Necktie
Whatever the fuck you do, just get out the place
I got some shit to blow that smile right off of your face

Yo, I'm from a unclean place, my son scheme papes
And as a youth I always tried to keep a dumb mean face
My lungs seen waste, the live flame keep my records framed
All my bitches tame, pen and pencils named, it's all a mental game
Haha, y'all make me laugh, bitches takin baths
With niggas doin stinky maths, so keep a safety stash
Cowards turnin crazy fast, let off a hater's blast
Let's show em they really sensitive like newborn baby ass
Strictly blazin hays and grass ( ? ) verbal massacres
Slash your wrist, make you laugh and piss, you don't know the half of this
My style is great, I annihilate a pile of weight
Try to take what's mine - mistake, you ain't dyin late
Chop your head like a cake and fry your face until your eyeballs dilate
Don't ever think you violate, word up, knowmsayin
Ain't no one comin in between me and my shit

It's the wicked, with another winner hit
Stickin ho's like I'm supposed to be, innocent (Ugh!)
Once again, let's get this set poppin
I got your head noddin and there ain't no stoppin
This here, crystal clear, pour it in your ear and let it sot up
Gimme the cash and just shut up
Tell me who brought those streets from Queens that bud special
Chronic choke, pull it, it pops your blood vessel
The hispanic Shaft packs a gat, too
(What else?) Produce and rap, too
Bless you like I hatchew
Basslines I'm throwin at you
Like pshhh, du-du-du-dum

I bust my gat lovely, low down, dirty and ugly
Shortly developped a taste for good bubbly
Don't bug me cause all the girls love me
And a lot of you cats is gettin wrapped in a rug, B
You all late, why you mad I got my own plate?
Think you niggas wouldn't catch it for the long case?
Ghetto pro, now you know, get the name straight
Holdin it down since them cables with the name plate

Okay here goes the blow, the bag, the mint
Grand time to represent flava so strong
Fills the room like Buddha scent, uhuh, I don't like choke
Gotta get paid so it's time to go for broke
Beatnuts hit the rhythm and I join right with 'em
Niggas can't see this flow so it's time to down sit 'em
I kick the flow for the niggas with the bald heads
Dreads, and 'fros, honey's, but no ho's
Oops! I didn't mean to call you ho, bitch
But when you try to clock the pocket that's that bullshit!
So let's get down with one of New York's finest
Seed to the brain like Primatine to clear the sinus
Grand Puba, Stud Doogie with the mad style
Beatnuts comin' with the rugged (Hey there, watch out now!)
It's on motherfucker, can't you see that?

Some incredible shit, some incredible shit uhh
Twist that baby up in here

'Ey yo Big Psych

What up, what up mami

Get on the mic and rock the M.I.C

Light a hell up, puff to my eyes swell up
When it comes to the green we got hell up
(My music bang, from here to releswelup (?) )
Bang you with the music, or bang you accapella
Like my shorty ran up, said get the cheddar
I'm making to much I'm getting hated by the tela
I'm making so much I'm getting customized leather
Brand new shoes, twenty-twos and better
So I pass those talking birds like berreta
Heavy rotation like a propeller
Every station saying this is something you never
Never heard before
So crank it up and hit the art-core
(art-core) (art-core) (art-core) (art-core)
Yo, yo next up

Yo I believe that's me

Armaretta, Rock the M.I.C

Invisible being gangster on the game
If this about hottest bitch then you know my name
See me in the street better bring the theme
Brooklyn representitive, the road to fame
I sit back, laid back thinking 'bout all my gats spittin'
Host to your cat man, as long being tapped man
In the club my niggas never left me
Go be getting out with knives cuz security ain't checking
Thread me stupid better think twice
He don't know how I get when I'm in the bar nice
Hot licks no ice, everything look right
Here dun hold tight I dig hopping ass hoes man as
Build and see life's about getting paid
About getting laid, at the hard getting sprayed
BK build up, white fox silled up
You expect us to live
Six hundred a crib
Now who's next

Yo I believe that's me
Passing the tree to Armaretta ripping it constantly
I specialize in distributing raw sixteens, tokem faries
Sending emcees out the frame
Like pigeons of my x-game
Intoxicated demon over skeemon
Only hit the key to club jumping
Niggas in there trucks dumping
Mammis look that jump and then they truck humping
Jumping in my whip
All on my dick
It's flash booties like watertheme amusement
Jump on her producers
Hit the exit, the tunes is dumb soft
My lungs cough
Opens allergies and metaphoric
Parafurnelly or lyrically taking care of you
Who else could it be, but that nigga named Problemz
Alias capping camons with the flif up in your feelings
Be easy and fall back like an extra
And don't be extra, or catch extras
And see your extra large fitted
Whenever I spit it automaticly
And quit it problemo, fowl pass me the demo's
Next up

40 oz,Unreleased Material EP,UnKnown,"Coming straight out the forest, rapping shit like a Brontosaurus
I lost him, I don't know where the hell my dinosaur is
Must be the weed, babe, I forget
Down a 40 on the set with my man Bobba Fett
Now it's 12 midnight and I'm looking for a victim...
Aiight, he stops at the red light
Two carjackers pull up on both sides
Raw, Bam pull open the door
Put my gun to his jaw, throw his ass to the floor
Or, sometimes these fools want to fight back
Bam, that's when I got to bust a freaking cap
Click, blow, out his temple
Don't think carjacking punks is simple
So when you see me coming, step on the gas
Punk, or I'm a bust that ass
I'm a bust that ass yo, I'm a bust that ass
If your ass don't step on the gas
All the fellas in the house if you're puffing on an ounce
And your ass gets thirsty (Crack the forty ounce!)
All the ladies in the house if you're hot and if you bounce
And your ass get thirsty...                                 (Repeat 2x)

The mack, fast cuts back, so what you say hops?
Drops the funky hits right in your party house
Can trick a cool fat cat just like (smack)
Freestyle's all that, got enough without a hat
Raw daog, whatever, she butter on my bag and hits
Clits with my dick like a black Jimmy Swaggart
I never boned a chick that I did make wonder
I never puffed a phil that could put me under
So light up and give me that good cheeba cheeba
I greet a senorita with a little mira, mira
Peace to Juan coming down your block
Knock boots in the shop with the butt of my Glock
Cock back, oh shit, that demon got a hammer
Salmmer, don't make me have to bust that whole fam up
They call me Bruce because I freak it so that you know
I rock so hard brothers think I'm doing Judo
All the fellas in the house if you're puffing on an ounce
And your ass gets thirsty (Crack the forty ounce!)
All the ladies in the house if you're hot and if you bounce
And your ass get thirsty...                                 (Repeat 2x)",https://genius.com/The-beatnuts-40-oz-lyrics

Max out
Prepare to blackout here comes
Open candela
Once again it's off the cadena
Tell you with confidence I don't believe in promises
Niggas slippin with the dough

Get ready for more problems like Puff and Tito
Everyone's a gambler nobody plays fair
You wanna be stupid paid
Well you're half way there stupid ass

I go click click pow off of the snare drum

Headed uptown to cop the finest

All my music is timeless
Gotta keep the pretty girls shaking them asses for ya highness
Juju could you buy me a beer
What the f**k's happenin here
No drinks til I'm tappin the rear

Get the f**k up outta my ear

And hear them gems from inside my crate
If you like a niggas style that's great
But please forget about my cake bitch

Black, I stick to bein ruff and rugged
Anti-pop, I guess I'll stay broke (F**k it!)

Nah, not me, I just pull the automatic
Out the knapsack, and cold point it
Blast ya, and leave your punk-ass disjointed
Yo, I ain't goin out like a punk
Nothin but fat rhymes and beats for your trunk to pump

V.I.C., droppin styles you ain't used to
Nice with the lyrics, when I produce I get looser
Beats I got plenty, they come a dime a dozen
I got more beats than Puertoricans got cousins
Diggin every day, I'm the breakbeat doodle
I got the funky shit, ask my main man Ju-Ju
Jump in the trunk, we Audi on a mission

I know a lotta spots that are ain't puttin ya up on
Find your own beats, you're a real snuffalafagus

Cause me and my niggas throwing rocks at your glass house
Put the trash out we coming to crash out
Become a norious style pulling mats out
Why you playin now I'ma put the flame on you
Ju got the canyon, Les the grenade launcher
I blaze ghanga like Jamaicans in Kingston
And shit on you and leave you stinkin
Light a match
U don't want it don't want it

I don't love hoes who catch me on the Ave with a snub nose
Late night ridin a bike watchin for po po
At a red light right in plain sight
On a summer on the low on the dead night
Y'all niggas don't want it with us
And they ain't really shit to discuss
All that shit you be spittin, it's us
Step to you with the steel out
Juju ain't the type of cat you wanna feel out

It's all you you can hate if you want (u don't want it)
Beatnuts keep blazing the blunts (u don't want it)
And beats banging the truck (u don't want it)
Gettin money worldwide we provide them up front (u don't want it)
All you women in the club we know what you want (u don't want it)

Catch you with the cross bow
Right through your torso
What you said (nuttin) thought so
Pass by your crib riding a horse slow
Just checkin out the negocio
Time to collect from the inner streets belly
Nigga wanna come short like Joe Pesci
Before I wack em I crack a cold pepsi
Click back all leave the space messy

Blowin guns like Jesse
Pulled my Glock out who wanna test me
I feel like the devil just possessed me
Burn more weed, I'm moving at hyper speed
Always carry two knives with me
For y'all niggas who be trying to hate
You fucking fake man
You know these are the records you be dyin to make
Think you're hot nigga yeah right
Hot in the ass fuck around get shot in the ass

It's all you you can hate if you want (u don't want it)

Eat at the spot like Pac you could believe it or not
In the streets in the drop you know my boys is hot
We spit fireballs you heard my click got my thousand yours
Hammer quipped we die for the strips defy the law
We the squad that do the job and beat the charge
A gold T with a old key will beat the job
You never know when you're bout to go
You never know when you're about to blow
Niggas get locked when the back is slow
On my pops we gonna pop the Mo
Pop the krizic cock is clicked
Til Seis get killed by the apocalypse
Ain't no stoppin this
We splurgin and mergin
Icein up the verse so nice they call me surgeon
Fuck what they heard twin
We the truth smoke weed on the roof
Puff live on the deuce get live off the 1-5-1 proof
You never know this ain't a rapper bein phony

Big Ju, rough and raunchy, never nonchalantly
And huant me to live in this world that don't want me
A foul nigga maybe the foulest you'll encounter
Murder for the smallest amount, money to count
Cuban cable givin' cash around the table
My record label watchin' the sons steady and stable
Bit my shit, but you wack and wasn't able
Silence, we bringin' the violence from the cradle
Fatal when I see a bitch nigga and face, you like a foreigner frontin' in a
Dangerous place
You in Corona, Stone City and Babalona
Dominicians got a tight grip Isatona
Pyscho Les:
Catch me in Corona, on a corner, hotter than Daytona
Sippin' Arizona, power moves on a celly phona
Touch tone flip, 9-11, the click, we connect like internet
Cash checks, blast techs, that burn holes to lest bet, faggots
Get they ass ripped, that quick, trying to play me like a camel
Fuckin' with my moola, telling me to change my formula
Alcohol and lye be the perfect combination, my organization move the nation
Like automation, with no hesitation, no doubt son (naw mean?)
It's off the books (it's off the books baby) It's off the books this year
Baby
