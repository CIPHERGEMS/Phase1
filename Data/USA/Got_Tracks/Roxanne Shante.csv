Roxanne’s Revenge,Def Mix Vol. 1,1985,"""Roxanne, feel it!""

Well, my name is Roxanne, a-don't ya know
I just a-cold rock a party, and I do this show
I said I met these three guys, and you know that's true
A-let me tell you and explain them all to you:
I met this dude with the name of a hat
I didn't even walk away, I didn't give him no rap
But then he got real mad, and he got a little tired
If he worked for me, you know he would be fired
His name is Kangol, and that is cute
He ain't got money, and he ain't got the loot
And every time that I see him, he's always a-beggin'
And all the other girls that he's always tryin' to leggin'
Every time that he sees me, he says a rhyme
But, see, compared to me it's weak compared to mine
A-every time I know that I am sayin' somethin' fresher
In any category I'm considered the best
And every time that I say it there ain't nothin' less
And everybody knows I will win the contest
So, then, after that came The Educated Rapper
His fingers started snappin', and my hands start to clappin'
Every time-a that I see him, everything he say
A-every time he says, he says it dumber this way:
He said-a, ""Yeah, you know your mother's name is Mary,""
But all he want to do is just-a bust a cherry
Every time that I see him, he's sayin' somethin' new
But let me explain to him what he should do:
He should be like me, a fly MC
Don't never have to bite, we're always right
I have the freshest rhymes that I do recite
And after that, and you know it's true
Well, let me tell you somethin' else about the Doctor, too:
He ain't really cute, and he ain't great
He don't even know how to operate
He came up to me with some bullshit rap
But let me tell you somethin'; don't you know it was wack
So when he came up to me, I told him to step back
He said, ""You call yourself an MC?"" I said, ""This is true,""
He said, ""Explain to me really what MCs must do.""
I said, ""Listen very close cause I don't say this every day:
My name is Roxanne, and they call me Shanté.""
But every time-a I say a rhyme-a just-a like-a this-a
It's something that you MCs just won't-a miss-a
And if you think it's cute-a, and you think it's all right
But, see, you said it in a language so you wouldn't have to bite
You started talkin' Pig Latin, didn't make no sense
You thought you was cute, yeah, you thought you was a prince
You're walkin' down the block, a-holdin' your jock
But everybody knows that you're all on my yacht
I'm just the devastatin', always rockin', always have the niggas clockin'
Everybody knows it's me, yeah, the R-O-X-A-N-N-E, yeah
Down with everybody fresh and everyone that I possess
And every time I do it right-a, everyone is sure to bite-a
Every time I do it, yeah, you know it is-a me-a
Rockin' on the beat-a that you can see
And every time I have a DJ like Ice
He ain't right, yeah, he ain't nice
Because a-everything he does is off-the-wall
Compared to my man Marley Marl
The way he gets on the tables, yes
Everyone knows that he is fresh
So, the UTFO crew, you know what you can do
Lemme tell you one for me, and then I'll tell you one for you
Every time you sayin' somethin' just-a like-a this-a
It ain't nothin' that I don't want to miss-a
And if you're thinkin' that I'm bitin' your beat
Well, then you just better know, and a-listen to me
Because my name is Roxanne-a, and I came to say
I'm rockin' to the beat-a, and I do it every day
I'm conceited, never beated, never heard of defeated
I'm rockin' to the beat-a, and you know it is-a me-a:
The R-O-X-A-N-N-E-a
And if you want to play a little game for me
Lemme show you what you can do, baby
'Cause with a twist of my cheek, and a twist of my wrist
I have all the niggas droppin' down like this
Yeah, I am fly but don't take this
And everybody knows I don't go for it
So, if you're tryin' to be cute and you're tryin' to be fine
You need to cut it out 'cause it's all in your mind
Tryin' to be like me, yeah, is very hard
You think you are God, but you do eat lard
Tryin' to be cute, and you're tryin' to be fly
Don't you know you wish you could be my guy?
So I can take you home, make you relax
And everybody knows that you're out there, tryin' to tax
Like corn-on-the-cob, you're always tryin' to rob
You need to be out there, get yourself a job
Yeah, you're tryin' to be in search of a Roxanne
But lemme let ya know--you're not a real man
Cause a Roxanne needs a man, and yes:
Someone fresh who always address
Someone, yeah, who will never fess
And then I'll say, yeah, the rest
Cause everybody knows how the story goes
There's no ifs, no ands, no buts, or suppose
No coke up your nose, no dope in your vein
And then it won't cause no kind of pain
But yet, and still, you're tryin' to be fly
I ask you a question, I want to know why:
Why'd ya have to make a record 'bout me
The R-O-X-A-N-N-E?

I want to be your man

Big Mama,The Bitch is Back,1992.0,"Save all the drama
Cause here comes the Big Mama
Any bitch who rip Shanté, I bomb her
Cause y'all weak-ass hoes got me fed up
So hookers, get your gloves, and yo, let's go head up
Wall to wall y'all, all will fall
I don't stall cause in this brawl, it's winner takes all
A title bout for all the clout
Any hooker trying to step to this, it's lights out
One hit, your head split, throat slit
Think you're Miss It, but I started this shit
At 14 years old I was going gold
While I was on tour, you was touring the ho stroll
Sucking dicks and turning tricks to get a quick fix
While I was putting dope hits in the mix
Ripping shows with Kane and Biz Markie
Fucking up Roxanne and taking out Sparky
Niggas came in flocks from blocks and blocks
To watch the Rox knock bitches out the box
And every place I played, I headlined
Strictly big names on the topic read mine
The q-u-double e-n
Queen of emceeing
Whenever I flow it's poetry in
Motion, so you can save all the drama
And get the fuck out the way, here comes the Big Mama

(Mama - mama - Aww!)
(I gave birth to most of them MC's)

Rhymes are deadly, so hooker, write out your will
Here comes the queen foot-first to your grill
Reciting poems that hit like boulders
Smacking your head dead off your motherfucking shoulders
So nip all the talk in the bud
This ain't no game, boy, I came to draw blood
At any hag thinking that she could last with me
It only takes one blast, and that ass'll be
Wrecked, ruined, damaged, ripped
Cross my path, your ass'll get whipped
Cause Shanté ain't about no games
Matter of fact, yo, I'mma start calling off names
First up is Latifah
You roll up, and I'mma smoke that ass like reefer
Cause you ain't never in life been a star to me
Sold the fuck out trying to go R&B
Now that shit is shady
You say ladies first, well I'm the first lady
And all y'all hoes are phony
Try to get flipped, I'mma rip you and your girl Monie
You're illegitimate, tryin to get a little bit
And I'm about sick of that 'Monie-in-the-middle'-shit
Your album cold garbage
Had one good jam, now you think you a star, bitch
Breaking your neck trying to be in the limelight
But give you a mic, and you can't even rhyme right
So get the fuck off the scene
Cause I got a M-16 that says 'Shanté's the queen'
And all you bitches got your style from me
The capital S-h-a-n-t-é
Used to go to my show, analyze how the sound flow
On the down low, fuck around, lay around, ho
So save all the drama
And make room for the Big Mama


The real queen's in effect
Whenever I come, yo, I come correct
And niggas give me the utmost due respect
And any hag that try to last
'll cold get smoked like marijuana cause her ass is grass
I dig ditches for you bitches
While I collect riches and give you a head full of stitches
Cause in a beef I don't sleep or lollygag
Sending you hags offstage in a bodybag
Cause Shanté is a rebel
You say you're ""Lyte as a Rock,"" you get crushed like a pebble
One word, and I'mma bag her
Watch the bitch stagger, cause I don't dig the bulldagger
To me a butch don't deserve a mic in hand
Somebody tell her to stop acting like a man
She needs something real thick to help her out quick
(What?) And that's a good piece of dick
Now as for that West Coast slut
With fake-ass hair, contacts, and a padded butt
Instead of ""stompin to tha 90s"", use your brain
And stomp your ass down to Jack LaLane
You better hurry and hop on a diet plan
And keep the pork chops out the frying pan
Yeah, I said it, so what?
You roll up, slut, you get a fucking gun buck to your gut
I'm bringing tears to all my peers
I ain't new, I been doin this shit for ten years
Bring any ho, and I'll wreck her
I rip the nicest, from Isis down to Salt-N-Pepa
And now you know that I'm the star of the show, ho
While I get dough, you're giving up the yo-yo
You say a nigga can't play with it
You got another job? Well bitch, you better stay with it
Cause you ain't shit in this here
Shanté's the queen, and I'm making it clear
Kicking flavors the way it's supposed to be
That's why no other emcees coming close to me
I leave em all in the dust
From crumbs to crust
It's a must that all opponents get bust
So get the fuck off the stage and save all the drama
And make room for the Big Mama",https://genius.com/Roxanne-shante-big-mama-lyrics
Have a Nice Day,Bad Sister,1987.0,"Some people call me Shanie, some people call me Rox
And those who try to diss I just knocks them out the box
Cos I'm Shanté and y'all know the routine
And here we go again, so all hail the queen
I left you for a while but it was worth the wait
Because it gave me just enough time to create
A funky rhythm that's guaranteed to move the world
Have the party people screaming out, ""Go on Girl!""
Just like Diana Ross, I'm the boss
And those who disapprove you can go for yours
But to think a girl like me, ha, is easy to take
You should treat me like Nell Carter, give me a break
Cause I'm the super female that's called Shanté
And like Hurricane Annie I'll blow you away
Whenever I'm in a battle, yo, I don't play
So you best go about your way and have a nice day

A lotta MCs today really know how to please
But I gave birth to most of them MCs
So when it comes around to the month of May
Send me your royalty check for Mother's Day
Because yo, ya know, ya can't deal with this
I'm Shanté the microphone grandmistress
A pioneer like Lola Folana
With a name that stands big like Madonna
Speaking of Madonna, some girls on the mic
Rap like virgins and get real tight
But I get loose with the rhymes I produce
That's why I'm queen of the crew with the juice
Cos I'm the super female that's called Shanté
And like Hurricane Annie I'll blow you away
Whenever I'm in a battle, yo, I don't play
So you best go about your way and have a nice day

Shanté, the baddest around
And a name like that can be broken down
As Supreme Highness Almighty Noble Topics Exponent
And any title for a girl, you can believe I own it
Cause to me there ain't nothing fresher
For me to rock..my pleasure
I'll pick up the microphone and start rocking
Say the funky rhymes that have the people clocking
Me, the S-H-A-N-T-E
Good looking, never tooken female MC
I'm five foot four, maybe a little bigger
Brown skin complexion with a nice figure
Yes, the super female that's called Shanté
And like Hurricane Annie I'll blow you away
Whenever I'm in a battle, yo, I don't play
So you best go about your way and have a nice day

You may remember the voice from a few years ago
When I first came out and dissed UTFO
I chilled for a while, I put down my pen
But now some suckas from the Bronx got me started again
Now I'm not out to diss the whole Boogie Down
Just a featherweight crew from that part of town
You made a little record and then you start fronting
Tried to diss the Juice Crew but ain't hurt nothing
Now KRS-ONE, you should go on vacation
With that name sounding like a wack radio station
And as for Scott La Rock, you should be ashamed
When T La Rock said ""It's Yours"", he didn't mean his name
So step back, peasants, popping all that junk
Or else BDP will stand for Broken Down Punks
Cause I'm an all-star just like Julius Erving
And Roxanne Shanté is only good for steady serving",https://genius.com/Roxanne-shante-have-a-nice-day-lyrics
Def Fresh Crew,UnKnown,1986.0,"We came here tonight to get started
To cold act ill or get retarded

I'm Shanté and the rhymes are def
Just rap so fresh 'til I get out of breath
Now this is somethin' that we do have to do
And this is a team that I must introduce
I'm Shanté, he's Biz Markie
We rap so fresh that they think it's three
Three of us who rap together
Strong as a bond that is tougher than leather
My name is Shanté and yes, I'm top choice
And you can tell by the sound of my voice
That the way that I rock that I am the best
Higher than the rest, plus considered fresh
Threw on my Filas and my Fila suit
Stepped out my house, I just knew I was cute
Bumped into Biz, he had on Filas too
I said, ""Yo, 
Biz Markie.
 What ya wanna do?""
He stepped out the house chillin', yes ya know
Went outside, it's kinda cold ya know
So I threw on the 
bomber
 so I could get loose
Matter of fact it was my black Goose
Stepped outside, everyone was on it
I said, ""You like it, baby. Don't you want it?""
They looked at me, they thought it was funny
And out of my pocket came a mint of money
Me and Biz went Uptown, yes
Chillin' around cos we know we're the best
And then this guy came up to me
He said, ""We want you to make a record, you see""
Looked at Biz, said, ""Do ya wanna do it?""
He said, ""Yeah, Shanté. There's nothin' to it""
I said, ""Alright,"" and time has passed
""I saved the money""
""Ha ha!"" and we laugh...

""That's not enough...
Things are gettin' tough and sort of rough
If you're not paying me ten G's or more
Then you might as well take your contract out the door""
He looked at me, he got so mad
And then when he left we were sort of glad
No, we don't sniff coke, we don't get high
All we do is dress real fly
Hang out at a party 'til the mornin' light
Chillin' all the time while other MC's bite
I say my rhymes, he does the beat
And you know me and him could never be defeated
We never sing Beat It and no, we don't Eat It
And if you do not like it, well yes you can bite it
And don't you go and get excited
I'm Shanté, he's Biz Markie
Side by side you know it's we
No, I don't speak French, when I say ""we""
I mean us two, not ""Yes, sirree""
Everyone knows that I am much better
Come on Biz Markie, get it together
Talk to the girls, you know they are wack
Tell those crabs they sound like cats...

That subject's cute and it's sort of fine
But another subject just came in my mind
It's sort of crazy, it's sort of wack
I'm talkin' about five-dollar cracks
Runnin' 'round town just stickin' up each other
Ready to rob each other's mother
Gettin' little capsules, don't wanna choke
And all you do is sit down and smoke
Your jaws move in, your body gets skinny
You spend your money to your very last penny
You walk around town in the same old jeans
And yes you know just what I mean
No, you're not cute and you're sort of wack
You're gettin' really skinny, only big as your hat
And if you wanna beef I'll tell you so
And here's a few things that you should know
Yes, it's crack, then it's Peace
Come on y'all, take it from me
I was told to stay away
This is a message from Shanté
You wanna dress fly and have some cash?
Well stay away from it because it's like a rash
Once you get it you start to itch
It's attached just like a (Hhhuh!)
Let's continue with what I said
Cos this is somethin' playin' in your head
Cos we come to party just to have action
Just to prove to you that I'm not Michael Jackson
Rap so strong and rap so def
Rap 'til I get out of breath
Now we have introduced to you
Me and Biz, the Def Fresh Crew...

Me and Biz, the Def Fresh Crew
That was def. See you later...",https://genius.com/Roxanne-shante-def-fresh-crew-lyrics
Queen Of Rox (Shanté Rox On),Def Mix Vol. 1,1985.0,"Why'd you have to make a record 'bout me?
The R-r-r-r-rrrrrr R-O-X-A-N-N-E
(Oh my goodness!)
Why'd you have to make a record 'bout me?
Why why why'd you have to make a record 'bout me?
Why why why'd you have to make a record 'bout me?
Why why why'd you have to
Why why why'd you have to make a record 'bout me?
The R-r-r-r-rrrrrr R-O-X-A-N-N-E
(Oh my goodness!)
R-r-r-r-rrrrrr R-O-X-A-N-N-E
Let me tell you a story yes
How I got to be so fresh
It happened one day you know
When I was sitting upstairs listening to the radio (hmm)
They said there is a contest
We'll give the most money to the girl who's the best
I said you let me enter
'Cause I know I am down
And everybody knows
It was all around town (huh)
And when I entered I came in first place
You should have seen the reaction on my face
They said said, ""Yo you won with that song
We gonna call you back so don't wait too long""
So I waited bout a week a week or two
And then they finally called me but the song was though
'Cause I could not remember not a word that I said
'Cause you know that night I made it up on my head (yeah)
They said well, could you sit down
Can you write this for me because it's all around town?
It's the most requested record that is on the radio
I said ""Yeah I'll do it"" he said ""Yo throw""
So I, got on the mic and started to say
Listen to me, because I'm fly Shanté
And when I started rappin' like this
It is something that they didn't want to miss
Then I had a far, far way to go
With a little bit of help (hassle?) from U-T-F-O
About saying, yes, that I'm Roxanne
And then they got so mad they said ""ish got damn""
She is making the top of the charts
You know she didn't even break our record, she broke our hearts
I said ""Yo, Kangol I'm so sorry
He said I'm going upstairs I'm gonna play Atari""
I said, well you do that 'cause you know that you chillin'
And everything you know, yo I am always willing
He said ""Yeah you know we got our own Roxanne""
I said yeah I seen that girl, she got face like a man (huh)
Tell me something else don't you see
I had to watch my language 'cause I got so many beats (huh)
Now you know what else happened
I went to Marley cuz he was a close friend
I said I want to make a record yes
He said come to my house and let me see you confess
I said ""No not that way, no not today""
He said ""You know I'm just playing Shanté""
I said all right I'll be up there tonight
He said ok but just say you rhymes and please don't bite
I said you insulted me you know
I never have to bite because I always throw
He said all right I'ma give you a chance
And then when I started rappin' I put him in a trance (huh)
He started cuttin' he doing alright
He said ""Yo come up here tomorrow night""
And then the next thing I knew I had did my part
And then I had got a call from Pop Art
He said ""Yo baby that jawn is fresh""
I said thank you very much because you know that I'm the best
He said, ""Yeah you know that you're at the top""
I said when I start to rock don't you know I never stop
Then he said ""Yo baby you got the cutest eyes""
He said where did you get them I said I don't know why
Then he said ""Yo who's your manager Ty""
I said ""Why-why-why Ty?""
He said ""OK you get by""
I said well a let me tell you I'm not finished
When I start to rockin' then I really start to ?
When he said ""Yo baby don't you know that's right""
I said yeah that's me I never bite
He said well tell me this could you please sit down
I said no 'cause this ain't my part of town
So then, I got this feeling when it was sort of chilly
I met these dudes name Don and Willie
It started a commotion, I felt this ?
And then the next thing you know it started a commotion
'Cause Dana came over in the middle of the night
I was listening to the wall, all I heard was a fight
So I said let me stay in my room
Then Marley broke out with a big ass broom
He said ""They ain't getting this outta here""
I said ok I'll stand over, right over there
And then along came Magic to save the day
You know what he did? He just ran away
'Cause he's a runaway...
Why'd you have to make a record bout me?
The R-r-r-r-rrrrrr R-O-X-A-N-N-E
Why'd you have to make a record 'bout me?
Why why why'd you have to make a record 'bout me?

Roxanne Shanté vs. Sparky D: Round One,UnKnown,UnKnown,"(Intro)
RS: Excuse me, but who would you be?
SD: Yeah that's right, I'm Sparky D
So listen my girl, what you have to say?
RS: Get it right, baby, Roxanne Shanté

Hi Roxanne, and how do you do?
My name is Sparky D, and I'm pleased to meet you
Let me tell you something, girl, that you should know
I'm Sparky D, and I'm running this show
You got braces in your mouth, you're full of disgust
Don't bother drinking water, 'cause your mouth will rust
You went to the doctor, and what did you hear?
The doctor said ""Rox, you got gonorrhea""
So you went back home and said ""Help me please""
Your man looked at you and said ""You gave me fleas""
You went back home, and started to nag
You started looking at your 
He said ""Damn, where you get this from?
Sparky D was right, I am a crab ""
So listen Roxanne, here's something to learn
You had a right guard but it made a left turn

A right guard? A wrong turn?
This is something that you must learn
'Cause you took it too far, and that is right
Now it's my turn, yes, to get on the mic
To prove to you that I'm the best
When I say my rhymes, I prove they are fresh
To let you know how far you'd go
Before I let everyone know you're a ho
I got you off the stroll in case you didn't know
And if you do not like it, I ask ""You wanna throw?""
Cause see, I don't play games
And don't call me no names
The words that you say do not make me shamed
Now I don't play with girls like you
Frankly when you say that I am through
But listen here, you know you're whack
Took a half-assed bite and you're much too fat

Oh such a pity, you're really too skinny
You're only fifteen, and you're just growing titties
You think you're a star with a size A bra?
And if you don't believe me I'll show DJ Marley Marl
You call me fat but I'm also fly
Say it once again and I'll punch you in the eye
I drag you, ho, up and down the streets
Then you know Sparky D can never be beat
I was walking one night, all alone
And I happened to glance by the funeral home
I rubbed my eyes, what did I see?
The R-O-X-A-N-N-E

I told everybody you was all on mines
See, there you go, sayin' my lines
The R-O-X-A-N-N-E
Stay off my shit, Miss Sparky D
I tried to tell you, don't mean to yell it
Do I have to break down and spell it?
Will you learn? It's my concern
Cause it is you I play to burn
You think I'm playin'? Listen to what I'm sayin'
You think that I'm jokin'? I don't need a token
Just listen to the words that I have spoken
Yes you live in Brownsville, and you are ill
Me and you could never be chill
'Cause you can't hang, that's right, I'm Miss Thang
I'll knock you out, with a boom and a bang
Now yes, you're a heavyweight, and that might be great
But you're the only one who'll be leaning over the gate
Getting fucked in the ass listen to 
And you're the only girl who ain't got class
'Cause they told me, you didn't think I'd hear
But they told it straight to me real clear
They tell me all about you
And all the niggas in Brooklyn that you screw

I'm Sparky D, and you should know
I've got pretty long hair and yours can't grow
I met this girl, and you know that's true
I'll explain this doll all to you
Her name was Shanté and she is wack
You couldn't hardly see her, she was too damn black
'Cause she got real mad 'cause I am too fly
If I was that crab I'd rather just die
Her name is Shanté and she is a dog
She's always on the border and she leaps like a frog
Every time that I see her, she's too young
She's too young to even make a man come
Every time that I see her, I'm the best
I'm Sparky D, and the case is dismissed
So listen my girl, this is something to dig
You cut your hair so you wouldn't wear a wig
Listen my girl, you're too skinny
If I was you, you're worth a penny
A penny

A penny? A nickel?  yourself then, 
Everyone told me how you did it
And if you did something like that, God forbid it
'Cause we all know that you're not with it
And when you  they spy your 
But he couldn't hit it, and you couldn't get it
So it's time for you, to get down with it
Now you must be blind, deaf and dumb
When I walk down the block I make Spyder come
Everyone knows just how I am
When I get on the mic, I don't give a damn
If you see that I rock, don't you see it is me
The R-O-X-A-N-N-E
Now you made me mad, you got me started
Now I bug out, cold get retarded
The rhymes I say: devastating
And yes you know you'll be imitating
And everyone knows that you're perpetrating
Now if you've never encountered an MC like me
I'll bust this shit here Sparky D
When it comes to rhymes I say
You can't hang with me, Miss Shanté
When I say Miss, I don't mean bitch
And this is something for a switch
I'm a girl, and I'm a 
You's nothing but a low-life scamp
I call you a scamp instead of a tramp
You walk down the block with your panties all damp
Everyone knows that that is right
And the doctor met you the other night
I went to his office, and there you had 
But you told him that he's reading my chart
When he read to you, don't you know what it said?
""Damn, I want to get that girl to bed""
When he read your chart straight to you
He said ""I'm sorry, Sparky D, but your pussy is through""
He didn't know what to give you yet
To fix your shit to make it fresh
Because yes your cookie is all crumbs
You's the only crab lowlife bitch who's a bum
You live in Brooklyn, you ain't good lookin'
Yeah I heard about your cookin'
I don't play games, don't call me no names
I'll say some shit to make you feel shame
I already talked about you with 
I talk about you, and that you suck dick
I told everybody how I rock a party
And when they see you that you're totally nobody",https://genius.com/Roxanne-shante-roxanne-shante-vs-sparky-d-round-one-lyrics
Independent Woman,Bad Sister,1989.0,"Ladies listen up, I really hope you're ready
Cause what I've got to say is far from petty
We've come a long way, baby, so maybe
Shanté can help a sister that's way be-
-hind, lost in the mind and can't find
Her way to a better day, you know the kind
So wrapped up in fairy tale dreams
So naive that every male seems
Honest and loyal, ready to spoil
Buying him gifts as if the boy's loyal
But Shanté is here just to say a few things
Some you heard before, but some are new things

So lend me your ears, dry up your tears
And let's hear the cheers for the years
Of the independent woman

(Yeah)
(Louder)

How many runny-nose kids can you have?
How many nights can you work on the ave.?
Your so-called man has a car and a Visa
He's living large while you're living on pizza
Unemployed while you wait for the perfect mate
Let's get one thing straight cause it's getting late
What you're waiting for is really never coming
No one hears the sorry tunes that you're humming
I'm here to bring the news, that if you're singing the blues
Everyday, it will not change the views
That people have of you, they say you're lost
Nobody forced you to quit, your future's tossed
You put your faith in the guys with the hazel eyes
You thought you would get a prize, all you got was lies
Now you're stuck in a room with a mopping broom
Did you assume that one day you will find a groom?
Are you dizzy? Who would ever marry you?
You're looking for a man that will carry you
And buy you nice things, like diamond rings
You're amazed at the truth that my rhyming brings
But the truth is the only way you'll ever see
That the life that you're hoping for will never be
But the race isn't over, put down the rope
Shanté is here to say there's still hope

So lend me your ears, dry up your tears
And let's hear the cheers for the years
Of the independent woman

(Yeah)
(Louder)

So much to live for, she wants to die
Life's full of pitfalls, maybe that's why
Her pops went to jail, her mother tapped her vein
City took custody and trapped her in pain
Feeling so alone in the room with a stranger
Hates her own blood and nothing's gonna change her
Angry at the world cause it doesn't play fair
So much despair does she feel, no one to care
Not a single family member will remember her
Smoke's in her eyes, and the past is a blur
She's on her own now, living with some other girls
With the same damn lives, but from a different world
These girls are lost, how the city is full of fools
So many years, no guidings, and no kinda rules
No love to give, yo, they need love to live
If not instead, they'll ponder in a bed
Sex is the thing that makes her feel wanted
Love and care, for she's undaunted
Because whoever is laying there won't really matter
Such a sad song when young dreams shatter
I really don't think glue is gonna fix it
But homegirl can walk the right path if she picks it

So lend me your ears, dry up your tears
And let's hear the cheers for the years
Of the independent woman

(Yeah)
(Louder)

The black woman role grows larger each day
Nothing in the way so what we teach may
Somehow help those young sisters that doze
And sleepwalk through life with their eyes closed
You don't need a man, all you need is to know you can
Then you can stand on your own two feet and
Achieve anything that you want out of life
Do for yourself, then you can be a wife
And you'll feel so good that you wanna shout
Because you got to the top and got there without
Relying on Tom, Dick, or Billy Dee
You don't have to turn the lights on to really see

So lend me your ears, dry up your tears
And let's hear the cheers for the years
Of the independent woman",https://genius.com/Roxanne-shante-independent-woman-lyrics
Brothers Ain’t Shit,The Bitch is Back,1990.0,"Brothers ain't shit
They lookin' for the next big ass they can stick
But this here chick's not on your dick
Pulling your cars up close by the sidewalk
And got the nerve to get mad if I don't talk
Stay schemin' on how they wanna stick it from the back
A young muthafucka sellin' crack
Go home and go to bed son
Your just coming from the barber shop and tryna' get your head done
Take your ass downtown on 10th Avenue
Because a sister like me is not having you
Playa, going round tellin' other brothers that you laid her
So I guess I'll see your ass later
Some brothers approach you while your shopping
Their girl's not around so they're going ho-hoppin'
From one girl to another
You turn your head for a minute, he's tryna kick it to your mother
Stop smilin'
I know all you wanna do is hit
And I really don't give a shit
They get mad cause I always look serious
So they swear I'm on my muthafuckin' period
I'm not impressed by the jewelry and the mink, dummy
Why don't you put some of your money in the bank, sonny
And if I hurt your feelings, I meant to
Cause these here pants, huh, you can't get into
Matter of fact I'm tooken
So you brothers in the Jeep can keep lookin' but I ain't hookin'
Yes I'm giving you the slip
All you can do is trick
Word
Cause brothers ain't shit
Brothers ain't shit
Brothers ain't shit
I'm on my way to the mall with a couple of friends
Some niggas pull up in a blue Benz
A kid named Mark with dark glasses
Talkin' about ""Yo, y'all got some real fat asses""
I kept walkin'
Tracy stopped and started talkin'
With all these motherfuckers hawkin'
With that dumb looking grin
Bitch gets in the car that was carrying three men
I know the whole game well
They spend a little money, you end up at a hotel
Well that's how they planned it
She didn't wanna screw so they left her ass stranded
That's what she get for whilin'
Cold left the dumb bitch somewhere out in Long Island
Next time she'll act decent
And her moms won't have to come and get her ass from a precinct
Remember Shanté told you
Drugs is not the only thing a girl can say no to
You gotta watch every move that you make on the street
Word up, cause talk ain't that cheap
It may become a bad habit
You see a brother with a little bit of dough, you wanna grab it
I get approached by a man sometimes, I throw a fit
Word
Cause brothers ain't shit
Brothers ain't shit
Brothers ain't shit
Brothers ain't shit
Brothers ain't shit
So don't honk your horn keep rolling
No I don't wanna ride cause the shit might be stolen
Anyway, I know your number
You got a ""gas, grass, or ass"" sticker on your bumper
Go ahead and say I'm stuck up
Cause I ain't doin nothing that'll make my rep. fucked up
Cause it happens to the best of us
Fuck the rest of us, niggas keep testing us
A man can make you wanna kill him
Or late at night, make you wanna thrill him
He'll give you money, you can even be fly
But he still has to cheat and you wanna know why
That's the dog in him, 'woof, woof!'
That makes him get up in the middle of the night and go 'POOF!'
You say 'Yo, yo where you going?'
He's cheating and he's skeezing and you're not even knowing
But this is what they usually do
Suck on the ting and they make you go 'WOO!'
And then he hits the door
And for the rest of the night you don't see him no more
He's got shit at your house, here's what you do
You should do some voodoo, hmm
Make his dick small
Make him see spiders on the wall
Then make him throw a fit
Why?
Cause brothers ain't shit
Brothers ain't shit
Brothers ain't shit
Brothers ain't shit
Brothers ain't shit",https://genius.com/Roxanne-shante-brothers-aint-shit-lyrics
Straight Razor,The Bitch is Back,1992,"One bad bitch, throw your hands up
Ain't goin' like a sucker, come on motherfucker stand up
I'm givin' out Frankenstein stitches
So come all at one time, I got somethin' for all you blind bitches
Wanna fight me for the dumb shit?
But as soon as you comin' out your mouth fast that ass is hit
See bitches get out of hand for nothin' at all
Small talk about somebody wanna fuck your man
The nigga ain't all that, he abuses you
And cruises through Manhattan with that stupid-ass hat!
Thinkin' that he's some kind of villain
They shot up his man, the duck motherfucker ran from the killin'
And you's a stupid-ass ho
For thinkin' that a nigga that be banging crazy doe won't let you go
But this here's another story
Cause see that I walk with a gun no matter who runs the territory
Cause see hoes be jumpin' fast
But I just pull it and put a bullet inside your ass
Sometimes you're in a jam
Can you deal with the fact somebody else is fuckin' your man?
And it happens kinda quick
Your bust in the house, another bitch's mouth is suckin' on your man's dick
What do you do: think straight? Or do you run to the back
Open the trunk to the nickel-plate 38?
""Wait wait, baby, please""
That's the shit he's coppin' when he's down on both his knees
And to you, the girl's a slouch
So you pull the trigger, her brains fell behind the couch
Now, you're facin' 25-to-life
For what, a slut? When you wasn't the nigga's wife?
Now, your ass is in a ditch
He doesn't accept your collect calls, ain't that a (bitch)

You cuttin' up bitches like a maniac
You losin' it, girl. Ain't a nigga in the world worth all that
No matter how many minks he buy, how many drugs he supplies
He has his eyes on another girl's thighs
That's why he flies to the streets
Meetin' up with another bitch, and takin' her to eat
Girls to him they come a dime a dozen
And they probably fucked his brother, fucked his father, fucked his cousin
How many more can I name?
You givin' all his relatives the pussy, it's a fuckin' shame
So you grab up the crab
On top of that, you get a dagger and went and started to stab
This motherfucker in his sleep
It's either that or pull a trigger on a nigga you can't keep
For self. Look out for yourself and stop worryin' about the rest
Go 'bout your business, tell the kid go 'head with his self
That's how it's done in a minute
He's goes on a roll and patrol for a hole to put his pole in it
And it ain't nothin' new
Just think of all the dirty shit he did to you
You say ""Please stay,"" but he still goes
He says ""Bitch, you wanna own a dick you gotta go buy a dildo""
You see, he don't give a fuck
Because he's all about makin' a quick buck and gettin' his dick sucked
And yo it ain't gonna change
A nigga like that is impossible to rearrange
So what you do: fuck him, fuck the money, and the blazer
Give that nigga a straight razor

So you can kill all that hand bit
And save it for the grave because it's dead and you can die from that man shit
Lock him up, well I doubt it
A nigga can hump every cunt and ain't shit that you can do about it
You're better off to forget him
A nigga don't wanna dig in his own ditch, then bitch don't fuck with 'im
You got a nigga that plays, ya walk around with a razor
Cause you got that you can fight like Frazier
So you duck him. Tell him good luck, and motherfuck him
And if your butt's still stuck, you better buck him
Tell the buck you don't need him
And read him up and down, don't frown
To beat him, that's how you defeat him
Scream and shout until you pass out
And if he lives in your crib, then throw his motherfuckin' ass out
Fuck what bills he pays, leave him in pain for days
When you give him a straight razor",https://genius.com/Roxanne-shante-straight-razor-lyrics
Bite This,Def Mix Vol. 1,1985.0,"The rhymes you're about to hear me recite
Are dedicated to all of those that bite
Put stolen beat and lyrics on the records that sell
Not only MCs, DJs as well
Come to my jam with your pad and take note
 you're at a party with the rhymes I wrote
Doesn't that make you feel just like a jerk?
Taking my rhymes and all my hard work
It's going around like a new disease
Biting my rhymes, those cubby skis
Running around thinking that they're choice
Saying my rhyme with their very own voice
Talk about how they're so devoted
Take my rhymes, you swear they wrote it
You wanna keep biting, you wanna persist?
What should they do Marley Marl? (Bite this!)
(scratches)
Talking bout how they're so devoted
Biting my rhymes, you swear they wrote it
You wanna keep biting and you wanna persist?
Tell em Marley Marley what to do (Bite this!)
(scratches)
Time to get it straight, time to make it clear
The real Roxanne is standing right here
When I look at myself, what do I see?
The R-O-X-A-N-N-E
Talking to all the guys and girls out there
You can bite this here, cuz I don't care
You can bite everything that I say
And tell everyone you got it from me Shanté
Because you took it too far and it's time to stop
All the other MCs are gonna drop
Run DMC, and I met Joe
You know what I said to him was so
Because I really don't care and I do not share
And to let you know, I'm known everywhere
When it comes to the mic and I do it like this
Just to give all others MCs a dis
They talk about how they're so devoted
Take my rhymes, and swore they wrote it
You wanna keep biting, you wanna persist?
Tell em Marley Marl what to do (Bite this!)
(scratches)
I'm getting aggravated and sorta upset
Just to make all you other MCs regret
The way I feel right now, you see
There ain't another MC in the world like me
Because the rhymes I say put me at the top
That's why all you other MCs had to stop
Stop this yes, because I'm the best
And everyone knows that I am fresh
Now if you haven't heard me once before
After you hear this you won't hear it no more
Cuz I don't play games and that is right
And just to let you know when I'm on the mic
And I start to rap and I do it like this
I got something MCs can kiss
But no I don't say things like that no more
And yes you might have heard it before
And they talk about how they're so devoted
Take my rhymes, you swore they wrote it
You wanna keep biting, you wanna persist?
What should they do Marley Marl? (Bite this!)
(scratches)
When I say bite it, I don't mean write
I mean take my words and try to recite it
Every word that I say don't you see that's right
When I say B-I-T-E, bite
When I say bite I mean take the beat
I mean do everything, take the movements of my feet
Take the spinning that I do and everything else
And then try to copy it by yourself
Now I'm talking to all you MCs out there
I'll say your name cuz I don't care
We got the Real Roxanne, Sparky Dee
All the other Roxannes imitating me
We got Run DMC and Kurtis Blow
Where do they come from? I don't know
And frankly I, don't really care
Because I'll say the other things MCs wouldn't dare
Like LL,  thinking that's all, but he needs a beat
There's other MCs out there in the place
That just make me feel like a disgrace
To be part of, yes, the MC race
They make me feel, such a shame
Thinking they gotta def record cuz they're playing a game
Like Inspector Gadget ain't that something
Frankly I know that rap ain't nothin'
If it was left to a girl like me
It would be at the top of the rap industry
Now I am known to have the freshest rhyme
To say everything so they get on mine
Yes, I am new, in the crew
But frankly I know just what to do
First, I grab a mic and a pair of 'phones
And just from there I'm in my own little zone
My own little zone with the freshest rhymes
Where every beat that I say gotta be on time
With the freshest things you wanna hear
Comin' out straight to you and real clear
Now I'm sorta mad and quite upset
And this is something for ya all MCs to regret
Talk about how they're so devoted
Take my rhymes, but swear they wrote it
You wanna keep biting, you wanna persist?
What should they do Marley Marl? (Bite this!)

Deadly Rhymes,The Bitch is Back,1992.0,"Deadly rhymes the pages of rage strikes again
Killing men, women and children
Til defeat, types of shelter, helter skelter
Nobody's around here to help ya

Up in flames, the brainstorm rain drains your veins
The only remains is rains of brains
Fixed to mix, Shante's lyrics cause conflicts
I'm bookin' my rhymes like convicts

God prayed for a death wish? Come on, step up
Some tried to keep up, but never kept up
When I roll, nobody can't hold me
So they all told me to make 'em die slowly

The warning signs of danger read ""please take precautions""
I'm giving your baby rhymes abortions
Hit the deck when I wreck, one got shot in the neck
Poison escaped through the tape decks
Confusion, havin' a need for a blood transfusion
She couldn't stop my intrusion

You're in the path of a lyrical tidal wave
Sound waves take you straight to your graves
Pain remains in your head, suffocation
Strangulation, wipe out a whole nation

On stage tryin' to recite like me
But what I really see is Creepshow 3
I size em up to die and pulverize 'em
So bad, her own mother won't recognize her

This goes for those, that oppose like foes
But I don't diss (I dispose)
Somewhere right near nightmare right where you might hear
Songs are long like light years

So here's a taste of the lyrical greats of all time
WHAT? Deadly rhymes
*Chorus*

Attack, ready to track the wack rappers who slack
I attract, cause you lack, you sad sack
The microphone fanatic comin' in with the impact
In fact this track, to subtract, I pack
A pile of stacks back in the sack for snacks
But I react, right and exact, cause I'm black
Got a taste, and treble and bass you can't chase
In case you wanna race the pace I got haste
To ace in your case, in your face just like mace
I replace, wreck the place and then erase, sho'!

I captivated, those that violated
Alienated, styles annihilated
Rappers, evacuated, faded, vacated
Waited, for my spot to be isolated
Crash and smash and bash you in the trash
In a flash, I whiplash you burned to an ash
A mass defeat, delete, rhymes are like concrete
Rap athletes all retreat to my beat
Except they don't step with pep, they get carried in a stretcher
Done by the treacherous rap wrecker

Start tearin' and scarin', what you're hearin'
Will put fear in, so I'm comparin'
You get tossed across like Kris Kross
To force, you fell of course, boss (so now you're lost)
All rhymes are organized like crime
That's why I titled this here design

Feelin’ Kinda Horny,Bad Sister,1989.0,"(This is definitely happening)
Ladies and gentlemen
Cold Chillin' Records proudly presents
Roxanne Shante featuring Q Neighbor, formerly Chilly Q
With Rich Joseph, Todd Sherman and my man Corey on that assistant, y'know what I'm sayin'
Special thank you goes out to Bobby from Tower Records
Yo, I'm feelin' kinda horny right about now
So, Shaunie, kick some flavour for me

Well it's about time the R-O-X-A-N-N-E
Grabbed the mic and stole your man and have you pissed at me
Just like old times, remember how they used to be
I was the only female on the mic that you want to see
But times have changed and I'm taking you a ride
Lookin' past the buildings and just after you reach the sky
I want a man who's a one woman kinda guy
My son Kareem is a lot but he doesn't feel the side of me
That needs to be released, you see
I want a man to relieve the beast in me
Come if you will but just come correct
And if you're really sure of yourself, then place your bets
I got Q ball standin' 'bout oh so tall
Nice cameo, cut
Here's your beeper, make a call
Jae Love is on the side, and never looking corny
Fellas blow the trumpets 'cause I'm feelin' kinda horny

Shanté's feeling horny
Shanté's feeling horny
Shanté's feeling horny

When I say horny I mean the horns that I'm playin'
Go real well with the words that I'm sayin'
Produced by Jae Love and the neighbor Chilly Q
I'm hooked upon the sounds that they gave to me to bring to you
It leaves you wonderin', just how is it?
Rhymes so dope, so short it's like a visit
There many MCs, or should I say wannabes
Touch the microphone without grace and ease
It's the way you move, you gotta show n prove
You know what you doin' or you're bound to get boo'd
But not Shanté, I'm sure to do it the right way
Collect the money, rock the party, start up on a new day
It's just a talent, that's got to be god given
Sucka MCs, tell me how you livin'
It's a damn shame that your rhymes are so corny
Fellas blow the trumpets 'cause I'm feelin' kinda horny

Shanté's feeling horny
Shanté's feeling horny
Shanté's feeling horny

Going back to what I said, first paragraph
Me needing a man? Now that's a laugh
Shanté is solo, ete numero uno
Speaking from the top, et cetera et cetera, eh you know
You get the picture, I'll smack ya little bitch-ya
You tryna stay on base but like a batter I'll hit ya
Gotta run? 'or you might get tagged, sid
Matter of fact, tag me 'cause I'm it
Miss thing, yeah, stamp it on a diamond ring
You get your free food 'cause your girl's Burger King's daughter
But you both are sort of corny
Fellas blow the trumpets, 'cause I'm feelin' kinda horny

Shanté's feeling horny
Shanté's feeling horny
Shanté's feeling horny

I'm in love with a trumpet, is that possible?
Chilly Q I must be buggin', call a hospital
Horny: a word used by the wind section
If I was a man it would be cause for an erection
Standing up tall, slouching not accepted
Jae gave me the beat as a gift and I kept it
Got so much to say but so little time to say it in
Give me a dope beat and like a gangsta I'll do it in
Gotta go, gotta go
But I'll be back again, see you at my next show
Or maybe at the movies, eating pop-corny
Peace and love to ya 'cause I'm feelin' kinda horny

Fatal Attraction,Bad Sister,1989,"Just gather 'round, this tale is rather chillin'
What I mean is thrillin', so listen if you're willin'
Cause Shanté has been through more than the average girl
Now I will send your mind through a twirl
Now usually I'm narrow-minded, never blinded
By any man, but some how I got binded
I mean caught up, he wasn't all that fly
I can't lie, he was cute in his suit and tie
But he wasn't my type, I mean he didn't own
A dope Benz with a rag top and a phone
He wasn't out gettin' paid by the mile
He was a different kind of man with a different style
He didn't sport a fat rope, and that was strange
He had a job at the New York Stock Exchange
Down on Wall Street, workin' 9 to 5
He was a man with a mind and a will to strive
He had a wife, but acted like she wasn't there
Long hair, they really made a lovely pair
But Shanté was ready for some real action
And this is the beginning of a fatal attraction
So I saw him nearly every day, what could I say?
""Hi, I'm Shanté, and could you leave the wife, by the way?""
I wasn't with it. He had to take the first step
I have a rep, and good is how I want it kept
But then it happened, one day he started kickin' it
And just to think, I thought that he was chicken shit
He gave his name, he couldn't give his number though
I gave him mine, and beat it like a drummer so
He wouldn't think I was on it but I really was
The same night, he had the nerve to give a buzz
And I thought, ""Damn, what a bad brother""
He said his wife was out of town with her grandmother
Pay him a visit—I said ""Yo, I'm not a dummy""
I know that's not the only kind of pay he wants from me
But I went, and somethin' told me not to go
But when I got there, he seduced me slow
Now I'm not the first date type
But this night Shanté was quite hype
And quite ready for all kinds of action
Soon you'll see why this is a fatal attraction
And so it happened, boy did it ever
I never been touched like that, I mean never
The whole weekend was very romantic
Then came Sunday, and I got frantic
Cause it was time to run, and I was havin' fun
He touched my cheek, and then he said ""See ya, hon""
I went home and thought it was short
Time I realized that I was caught
And for the next four months of us dating
I kept anticipating and waiting
Because he told me he and his wife were through
Finished, over, I just had to wait a few
So I waited, and time kept passin' on
Three more months, and still she wasn't gone
I got mad, I asked him what the problem was
We sat down, and bust what the brother does
""Sorry, baby, what was I thinkin' of?
I have a wife, and that's who I really love
And as for us—"" ""Please, don't even run it
Cause if you loved her, you wouldn't've never done it""
I started breakin' and he was about to see some action
And feel the pain of a fatal attraction
Well, this story has such a sad ending
And I hope these men stop pretending
As if they're single, and try to mingle
Cause one day you might feel a tingle
Between your legs, and when you look down to check
Ha, surprise! Go 'head and break your neck
Search high and low, look near and far
But what you're lookin' for is somewhere in a pickle jar
Just like him, cause he's in a hospital
He had a big one, but now it's kind of little
So little, he can't stick it any place
He tried to play me, and he lost the race
But that's not that he lost
Jimmy's gone, and that's the cost
Of my fatal attraction",https://genius.com/Roxanne-shante-fatal-attraction-lyrics
Trick or Treat,The Bitch is Back,1992,"So you say you got money but ain't spendin' it?
Well if that's your move, fool, Shanté has been in it
You gotta peep what's on display, honey
And I ain't sleepin' around for sneaker money
Picture me lettin' a nigga get his dick soaked
Then splittin' and hittin' a mother fucker cold broke
I gotta look out for self, dear
Give me the riches you can keep those other bitches on welfare
Where's my props and all that?
Yeah you're goddamn right that I'm a spoiled-ass brat
""But Shanté, I love you, baby.""
But what the fuck have you done for me lately?
I'm not sayin' I got a fee
I'm just sayin' that the pussy ain't for free
I ain't tryin' to play you like a sucker
But if you get in these pants, believe you paid for the motherfucker
It ain't about a nigga peepin' me
It's all about a nigga treatin' me and eatin' me
Playin' niggas in the streets
You either lick or you trick or you treat

A nigga can't play me like I'm soft
Steady flashin' all that cash, nigga pass off
'Cause there's no layin up if niggas ain't payin' up
I'm out for the bucks, I ain't playin' ducks
I'm shallow in the gifts than men give
I need a place, 'cause my taste is expensive
So if you crack a lot on the drug lot
I want diamonds big as motherfuckin' Plymouth Rock
I'm  that slack
And when their pockets ain't fat, I make em scat like a cat
Shanté likes a candlelight dinner
But that just ain't enough to get up in her
Make me glitter if you want to hit a home run
No money, you're gettin' left on a bone, son
And I'll be  'cause ain't nobody stiffin' me
Ain't no ho-hoppin' without shoppin' at Tiffany's
It's not about havin' a man up in my fanny
And goin' home broke and wet all in the panties
There ain't a motherfucker THAT cute
To knock Shanté's boots without spendin' loot
So if you make a lot of bank
Remember you don't get the pretty pink without a mink
So if you see me in the streets
Holdin' hands with a man then he's a trick or a treat

Send me a limo, fuck the cabs
I'm only up for grabs if you got tabs
So I'm tellin' all you cheapskates
You can't get the case just for takin' me to beefsteaks
You think 
But you gets one of these without G's
So before my legs can crack, hit me off with a stack
Or step your black nigga ass back
'Cause I got money I have to make
And if you can't play the rate, then your ass'll have to masturbate
It's all about the gimme-gimme
You say you want to get with the slimmy but yo your jimmy ain't goin' in me
You gotta get 'em for the bucks
'Cause you only get stressed messin' around with broke fucks
You want ass, the cash is first
You got dead presidents baby, I got a hearse in my purse
So call off Washingtons and Lincolns
I want the Grants and the Benjamin Franklins
So I hope your pocket's steep
You  dick, use a trick or a treat",https://genius.com/Roxanne-shante-trick-or-treat-lyrics
Shanté Gets Wicked,The Bitch is Back,1992,"(""Let me tell you somethin'"")
(""Shanté's performin' and it's gonna be wicked"")

Shanté gets wicked as I kick it
Booty MCs better ease 'fore I stick it
So far the  can't even find it
Music is my business, and so you better mind it
Cause if I see your nose, end it I'm a bend it
Send it to the hospital to be mended
There's too many stank skanks wanna be top rank
 MCs are gonna be shanked
Sucker MCs I despise, who try to rise
Up with the same old style as 
Boom is the sound of the bass and I kick it
In your face, in the place, MCs get a taste
But before you eat it up, let me heat it up
And wash your face, just in case I wanna beat it up
You can't sit, you wanna get with the shit
That makes you have a fit 'bout every time you hear it
I drop rhymes hard as  on your head
Sleepin' MCs are already in the bed
This is a wake-up call as I break up all
Bullshit MCs in the rap world
You can't test the  this
And I don't miss, I just bust you with a fist
Blood, pus, and other stuff is gonna ooze out
Girl you're gonna lose out, break the  shoes out
And you still can't go up against me
I'll have you livin' on the 
WKRP, now what kind of  will pose a threat to me?
Not one, son, they all got done
Cause none of those sorry MCs are number one
Ah, here we go see kick it
Cause Shanté gets wicked

Shanté gets wicked as I kick it
(""Get wicked!"")
(""Let me tell you somethin')
(""Shanté's performin' and it's gonna be wicked"")
(""Go on, girl!"") (""Get wicked!"")

I get wicked 'til the jam is done
Somebody yelled out ""The bitch got a gun""
But yo, look again, that's not what I'm holdin'
Just your attention and the mic. I rolled in
To the party, I didn't have to reach
They already had a mic so 
Just the , what a joke
I pulled myself together, then I broke
Fool, I took em to school in a duel
So I taught as I fought, and it's a 
Understand the ways that my mind works
And what's at stake cause I break when I find jerks
Holdin' a mic, but they're not hype enough
Cause that's the type of stuff that makes me ride 'em rough
And that's why they're in a cat's eye
And I'm unannounced when I pounce to to the rest. Try
To escape the hills they're heading for
Ride it for life and I might keep sheddin' more
Than you can take, so put on your darker shades
And here we go cause I'm gonna spark the page
And rip parties apart with a passion
I move your butt and that's what brings the cash in
I saw you run for the dance floor and when your pants tore
You just kept movin' like ants or
Beetles were in your drawers, watch the needle 
With the  is gonna cut into my jaws, pause
Stand clear as the mic is grabbed
The girl is here and MCs is stabbed
Not with a knife but a rhyme and 
And something you care for and therefore you shank
Egos are bleedin' three rows of rappers
Pleadin' that I hold back but I'm proceedin'
To give a bunch of rhymes and the punch of
A champ, as I  to the hunch of
Victory, it's no small trick to be
Rhymin' off strong, yo that sounds slick to me
So I'ma drop somethin' really really rough on ya
I know you want it, don't even try to bluff on it
Yeah, you didn't think that I could kick it
Cause Shanté gets wicked",https://genius.com/Roxanne-shante-shante-gets-wicked-lyrics
Runaway,Def Mix Vol. 1,1985,"It's a story, I came to say
To tell you just about those runaways
Oh you run away, and you leave home
Just thinkin' you're grown, want to be on your own
But yo, I came to stop you, right in your tracks
I am your conscience, for you to turn back
I came to tell you, what it's about
How you should stay in and you shouldn't go out
Now I wanna tell you yes, how the story goes
Just in case you didn't get the knowledge and you don't know
I want to tell you just how it is
Out there in the streets and all the other biz
This is what happens, straight to you
And don't stop me until I'm through
First you run away to a city yes
Sayin' I'm gonna live and be super fresh
But it don't work that way, don't you see?
So come on listen, straight to me
'Cause I am your conscience and your guide
Sayin' don't run away straight from the inside
You're a runaway


Now I am the spirit, inside your body
The one who makes you want to dance at a party
I'm the one who lets you have fun
Who always tells you to go home, at quarter to one
And when your mother told you, to be home, yes
I'm tellin' you my decision is best
If you don't want to listen to me
Let me tell you how it is, out there on the street
First you meet the pimps, the pushers yes
They always sweep you up and tell you ""You are fresh""
They buy you all clothes, give you coke in your nose
But where do you go?  No one knows
See I can foretell the future, just in case you don't know
And this is the way, the story will go
First you live over here, then you live over there
Then you live in the streets, won't be livin' anywhere
You'll have no kind of income, comin' to you
And now you know your life is through
You should've listened to me, straight from the start
Because I'm givin' you advice, right from the heart
You're a runaway


I will tell you, the straight up truth
And now we're sittin' out here, with no juice
We're just sittin' on a corner, just like this
And it is home that we don't miss
I tried to turn you around, once before
Before you walked straight, out the door
Before you threw down the key, you should've listened to me
'Cause now we're out here, just livin' in the street
You're a runaway

Why did we run away?

We ran away, we did it this time
That's the whole purpose of me sayin' these lines
I had to let you know, just how it would go
You don't listen to me, don't you think I know?
I kept telling you, just how it would be
I am your conscience, just listen to me
I am a friend, I am true
And since it's happening to me you know it's happening to you
Runaway

Why does she run away?

Listen to me, this is no lie
You coulda stayed in school, could've went with that guy
Remember the guy, he was sitting down?
The one that wanted to take you out on the town
Why are you ruining your life?  You could be his wife
You're stabbing me yes, like you're using a knife
You're not really doing, you're hurting yourself
But listen to me, 'cause I'm good for your health

My Groove Gets Better,Bad Sister,1989,"My groove gets better and better now don't it?
My groove gets better and better now don't it?

I got the skills to deal
All the funky shit, plus the hips that just don't quit
My name is Shanté but you can call me Shannie
Makes no diff' word up, word to mommy
I'm still the queen up on the scene
So fly that I cause your man to fiend
Now hold up, this has gotten outta hand
There's a posse of witches f-ing up the program
So grab your brooms and prepare for flight
Because I'm back and this time I'm more than hype
I'm causing raucaus ???
Action's what you want they might give it to me
I gotta give to live to my personnel
I'm the director, directing the party well
So come along and step in my dimension
And bob your head to my funky invention cause


The microphone passing, indeed we can do this
And when I'm done, you're gonna be shoeless
Cause I'm not an amateur, I make you get down
So you better have much soul when I'm around
I go off, get loose like a master
Deal with Shanté, gimme a glass of milk
I treat MCs just like cookies
Chew 'em up, spit 'em out, to all rookies
Be on the look out in other words look twice
All competition, huh I put on ice
Fickle and feeble opponents I find them
When you in line with me you can't win
I'm just too advanced, a typical hot pose?
I do damage, yes to the utmost
So hold up, step back, you ought to think twice
Just think again cause Shanté is too nice
On beats like this god damn I get nifty
You must be nuts, trying to get with me",https://genius.com/Roxanne-shante-my-groove-gets-better-lyrics
Queen Of Rox (Shanté Rox On) Street Version,UnKnown,1985.0,"Why'd you have to make a record ’bout me?
The R-R-R-R-RR-R-R-R-R-R, R-O-X-A-N-N-E
(Oh my goodness!)
Why'd you have to make a record 'bout me?

R-R-RR-R-O, R-R-R-O, R-R-O-X-A-N-N-E
Let me tell you a story yes
How I got to be so fresh
It happened one day you know
When I was sitting upstairs listening to the radio (hmm)
They said ""There is a contest
We'll give the most money to the girl who’s the best""
I said ""You let me enter
Cause I know I am down""
And everybody knows
It was all around town (huh)
And when I entered I came in first place
You should have seen the reaction on my face
They said, ""Yo you won but with that song
We gonna call you back so don’t wait too long""
So I waited bout a week, a week or two
And then they finally called me but the song was though
Cause I could not remember not a word that I said
Cause you know that night I made it up on my head (yeah)
They said ""Well, could you sit down
Could you write this for me because it's all around town?
It’s the most requested record that is on the radio""
I said ""Yeah I'll do it"" he said ""Yo throw""
So I, got on the mic and started to say
""A listen to me, because I'm fly Shanté""
And when I just started rappin' like this
It is something that they didn’t want to miss
Then I had a far, far way to go
A with a little bit of hassle? from U-T-F-O
About saying, yes, that I'm Roxanne
And then they got so mad they said ""shit god damn! (huh)
She is making the top of the charts
You know she didn't even break a rec' she broke our hearts""
I said ""Yo, Kangol I'm so sorry""
He said ""I'm going upstairs I'm gonna play Atari""
I said ""Well you do that cause you know that you chillin'
And everything you know, yo I am always willing""
He said ""Yeah you know we got our own Roxanne""
I said ""Yeah I seen that girl, she got face like a man"" (huh)
He said ""Yo baby that's what she got?""
I said ""Yeah she couldn't even fuck with pop!""
Tell me something else don't you see
I had to watch my language cause I got so many 'B's (huh)
Now you know what else happened?
I went to Marley cuz he was a close friend
I said ""I want to make a record yes?""
He said ""Come to my house and let me see if you're fresh""
I said ""No not that way, no not today""
He said ""You know I'm just playin' Shanté""
I said ""All right, I'll be up there tonight""
He said ""OK but just say you rhymes and please don't bite""
I said ""You're insulting me you know
I never have to bite because I always throw""
He said ""All right I'ma give you a chance""
And then when I started rappin' I put him in a trance (huh)
He started cuttin', he w'doing alright
He said ""Yo! come up here tomorrow night""
And then the next thing I knew I had did my part
And then I had got a call from Pop Art
He said ""Yo baby that joint is fresh""
I said ""A thank you very much because you know that I'm the best""
He said, ""Yeah you know that you're at the top""
I said ""A when I start to rock don't you know I never stop""
Then he, said ""Yo baby you got the cutest eyes""
He said ""Where did you get them?"" I said ""I don't know, why?""
Then he said ""Yo who's your manager, Ty?""
I said ""Why-why-why? Ty""
He said ""OK you'll get by""
I said ""Well a let me tell you I'm not finished
A when I started rockin' did I really start diminish?"" 
When he said ""Yo! baby don't you know that's right""
I said ""Yeah that's me, I never bite""
He said ""Well tell me this could you please sit down?""
I said ""No, 'cause this ain't my part of town""
So then, I got to Philly where it was sort of chilly
I met these dudes name Don and Willie
It started a commotion, I felt this 
And then the next thing you know it started a commotion
Cuz, Dana came over in the middle of the night
I was listening to the wall all I heard was a fight
So, I said let me stay in my room
And then Marley broke out with a big ass broom
He said ""They ain't gettin' this outta here""
I said ""OK, I'll get over, right over there""
And then along came Magic to save the day
You know what he did? He just ran away
Cuz he's a runaway
