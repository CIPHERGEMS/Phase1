Lil Tunechi got that fire
And these hoes love me like Satan, man
Yeah, fuck with me and get bodied
And all she eat is dick
She's on a strict diet, that's my baby
With no makeup, she a ten
And she the best with that head
Even better than Karrine
She don't want money
She want the time that we could spend
She said, ""'Cause I really need somebody
So tell me you're that somebody""
Girl, I fuck who I want, and fuck who I don't
Got that A1 credit, that's that filet mignon
She said, ""I never want to make you mad
I just want to make you proud""
I said, ""Baby, just make me cum
Then don't make a sound""

Can't treat these hoes like ladies, man
Pussy, money, weed, codeine
She said my dick feel like morphine
I hope my name taste like sardines to these niggas
She wake up, eat this dick
Call that breakfast in bed, 69, 96
I feel her heartbeat, I chest-to-chest with this bitch
Now turn around, face down; I'm arrestin' this bitch
Yeah, all my bitches love me, and I love all my bitches
But it's like as soon as I cum, I come to my senses
And I would say these hoes' names
But then I would be snitchin'
And these haters try to knock me
But they can't knock me off the hinges

Believe Me,Tha Carter V (2014 Version),2014.0,"I'm the only one that get the job done
I don't know a nigga that could cover for me
Yeah, got some game from my dad
He said she might say she love me
She don't love me like she say she love me
Believe me, believe me
I'm that nigga, boy they love me in the streets
I'm not tryna find nobody else to beat
I'm the one they come to see because they all
Believe me

Yeah, rip, rip rip
It's been me and Young Tune off the rip
That's the man that put me in this shit
If a nigga fuck with him, I'll put him down quick
Got a verse for anybody wanna talk about the clique
I've been takin' shit light, you don't wanna hear me trip
God damn, do y'all really know who y'all fuckin' with?
Yeah, I mean you can't blame me for wonderin'
Doesn't matter, could be winter or the summer
On the road, I do One Direction numbers, I don't fuckin' miss
Yeah, Stunna and Mack know
When Wayne was gone for eight months, we put this thing up on our back
And I was snappin' off on every single track though
Collect call from the boss like where we at though
I was like, ""Hah, it's our time, nigga""
He left Rikers in a Phantom, that's my nigga
And I'll been rockin' with the team 'til Carter IX
And we YMCMB, waitin' on somebody to try us, nigga
Yeah

I'm the only one that get the job done
I don't know a nigga that could cover for me
Yeah, got some game from my dad
He said she might say she love me
She don't love me like she say she love me
Believe me, believe me
I'm that nigga, boy they love me in the streets
I'm not tryna find nobody else to beat
I'm the one they come to see because they all
Believe me

Lord knows I'll murk one of these niggas, yeah
His and hers Ferraris, nigga
One for me, one for my daughter, nigga
Waitin' for someone to test me like a Harvard nigga
I tote a 223, two Michael Jordans, nigga
Come on, fight these shell cases like a lawyer, nigga
Find out where you stay, and act like we found some oil, nigga
Out of duct tape so when he prayin' I ignore the nigga
All I gotta say is ""sayonara, nigga""
Drop dead gorgeous but the bitch ain't dyin' for a nigga
Where the real queens at? Shout out Capone and Noreaga
We can shoot it out and see who live to tell the story later
Diamonds in my Rollie face cannot be exfoliated
They think I'm associated, I'm the one that orchestrated
Yayo get her ass whipped, whip that ass like horses racin'
Ain't 'bout what you walk away from, it's 'bout what you walk away with
Dead Presidents, them coffins vacant
I must be doin' somethin'

I'm the only one that get the job done
I don't know a nigga that could cover for me
Yeah, got some game from my dad
He said she might say she love me
She don't love me like she say she love me
Believe me, believe me
I'm that nigga, boy they love me in the streets
I'm not tryna find nobody else to beat
I'm the one they come to see because they all
Believe me

Had to get it poppin' off the rip
Rich young nigga that ain't never had to trick
Slim Thug flow but you know I like 'em thick
If she get a job at DOA, I drop her off a tip
I had to get it poppin' off the rip
I'm the one they tell yah been reppin' in the 6
Come into the city and yah niggas get to trippin'
We'll take yah to the Scarborough Bluff and drop you off a cliff
Well damn, just be happy for the man
Nirvana, Coldplay, nigga got bands
Ink from the money, got it all over my hands
Goin' out to Houston, spendin' all of my advance
V Live just took me for a cheque
""Drake you know I love you, you just took me outta debt""
Yes, right now you are lookin' at the best
Mothafuck award shows and mothafuck the press like that

Mothafuck the rest
When they jumped off the porch, I was stumblin' up the steps
I'd give what I collect before I give up my connect
It'd be a cold day in Hell, icicles made of sweat
One finger, slidin' 'cross my neck
Niggas know what that mean like they deaf
Nigga I'll fire this nina like it's her first day
On the job and the bitch overslept
Tune stay humble, nigga I'm a king
Need a horn and a drumroll
They throw mothafuckin' roses at my feet, nigga
I don't step on one rose
I'm the only one that get the job done
I don't know a nigga that can cover for me
Tape a couple kilos to the bitch stomach
She look like she got a bun in the oven from me
Preheat,
 believe me
All you gotta do is pay me every week
I had these bitches havin' babies every week
I'm the nigga, see me skatin' in the streets
Gone

Mona Lisa,Tha Carter V,2018.0,"I got a story to tell, you know that I cherish thee
Hope it ain't too many feelings involved

I see niggas in this bitch
Stuntin', poppin' bottles
Gettin' drunk with these bitches
And when they leave they get followed
Fall asleep with that bitch
And really don't know much about her
Then she let us in, we take all of your shit
And when you wake up, she help you try to find it, I love it

I be with bitches that be with bitches
That be with niggas with riches
I tell her, ""Get him,"" she say, ""I got you""
I say, ""No, bitch, I said get him""
And they so pretty, and they hair lengthy
He hit it and sleep on her titties
Then she give us the word, we come through with AKs
It's a stick-up, she scream like a victim
Now you feelin' so silly
I smoke color purple, I'm up in here feelin' like Celie (Ooh)
Nappy-ass dreads, what's that you say?
Watch your mouth, Milli Vanilli (Ooh)
You can get snaked, you can get faked
Out by the bitch that you feelin'
'Cause you thought that she was an angel
That bitch ain't no angel, I treat her halo like a frisbee
And you tellin' your business, she tell me your business
You tell that bitch what you feelin'
All of the beans you be spillin'
To you, she lie through her teeth cavities, fillin's
She know where you hide it tell me where it's hidden
She know when you're gone, tell me when to visit
We break in your home and take the specifics
And meanwhile, the bitch is on vacation with him
So she don't get blamed, we don't snatch chains
We find out addresses, and we don't leave messes
You'll only know that it's gone when you check it
Then your first thought is to start second guessin'
She say, ""What's wrong?"" He say, ""Nothin', keep restin'""
She say, ""What's missin'?"", ""How you know somethin' missin'?""
He scratch his head, she say, ""Get back in bed""
And she gave him some head
Boy, you can't trust them bitches, and then she say—ooh

I see niggas in this bitch
Stuntin', poppin' bottles
Gettin' drunk with these bitches
Then when they leave they get followed
I be with bitches that know the bitches
That's with the niggas we followin'
Get them on the line, stay two cars behind
And tell them hoes, ""Don't be so obvious!""

Mona Lisa, long hair, don't care
She handle the business and don't ever tell
She bite the bullet and cough up the shells
She tell 'em, ""Ooh, daddy, let's go to your place!""
And if he say yeah, then we meet him there
She feed him lies with his silverware
She don't want love, she just want her share

I know a bitch named Liz
This nigga think she his 'cause she tell him that it is
So he tell her all his secrets, he tell her all his fears
And then she tell me and I be all ears
And then I go and tell my people and they already know him
And then I call Liz and she say he comin' over
I say, ""Good girl, just remember what I told ya""
She gave me the salute, I say, ""Girl, you're a soldier""
We're waitin' outside, watch him pull up
Walk up to the door and right before he knock
She open the door naked, she left it unlocked
They started French kissin' so he didn't see moi
And then she let him in, they stopped on the couch
Music up loud with his head in the clouds
Turn that shit down and I scared the piss out of him
Piss a nigga off, put a gun to his frown
Nigga, turn around, I ain't here to fuck around
I ain't here to fuck around, caught you wit' your pants down
You know what it is, put your fuckin' hands up
Liz, that's enough, you can put your hands down
And then he looked dead at her and he shook his head at her
She a good actress and you a dead actor
You'll be dead after we get what we're after
If Liz call you daddy, she about to be a bastard, oh
I got way too many bitches that do anything for me, nigga
But think for me, nigga
Send her to you like she ain't for me, nigga
I hope you alone like bankruptcy, nigga
She pour you a drink, that drank on me, nigga
She slip somethin' in it, now faint for me, nigga
Mona Lisa, I done painted the picture
Mo-Mona Lisa, out the frame on these niggas
Pussy got you out of character, nigga
You fall for these hoes off your ladder, my nigga
Take everythin' that you have 'til you don't even have an opinion
We have your attention
And now you're lookin' down a barrel though, nigga
Now she lookin' for her pantyhose, nigga
We just lookin' for the casserole, nigga
But she gon' show us where you stash it though, nigga (Mona)
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar & 
Lil Wayne
]
Ah, every day she wake up with a different color makeup
And a promise he gone take her to the movie and the mall
Chillin' with the Laker, on the floor, fourth quarter
Four minute on the clock, Black Mamba with the ball
Paparazzi lookin' at 'em both poppin' up and take a picture, uh
Probably on a Internet blog
In a minute, he gon' be admittin' that he love her on his mother
Man, he want to meet her mother by tomorrow
Mona Lisa
Pussy good enough, it got him sinnin' in the walls
And he diggin' in it like he livin' in it
Make a new religion with it, man a nigga 'bout to go against God
Poetry in a pear tree
Sweet tone like a hummingbird when she asked him
Did he want to make love in a yellow taxi
Never gave two fucks, jumped in the backseat
Woke up in the mornin' to 
The Great Gatsby
Then he dogged it again like the bitch Lassie
I'm a dog in the wind, I'm a pit laughin'
I'ma call up again like I did last week
Make good with the friend and I'm all jazzy
Britney with the twin and the girl Ashley
Found out that I fucked, he was unhappy
Bitch, I never let the bullshit get past me
Better yet, I wanna break up, don't you ask me
'Bout a motherfuckin' double standard, actin'
Fuckin' on another nigga, that's a negative alone
But you sucked his dick? That's just nasty
Matter of fact, bitch, gimme your phone! (
No!
)
You fuckin' with Wayne's? (
No!
)
Bitch, gimme your phone! (
No!
)
Let me, let me take this call real quick
(…
 lick me like a lollipop
) He on your fuckin' ringtone?
Is that the shit that you do? [
sniffing
]
Touchin' yourself, lookin' at Kendrick videos
Jump on the internet, watchin' his interviews
I don't know what the fuck lately got into you
Tell me who love you, I bet I love harder
Forgot all the shit that I did for your daughter?
The Pampers, the Pedialyte and my momma
Daycare after school and she never did charge ya
You scandalous as fuck and I hope you blow up
You know what? I give up, let me go get my gun
I got one in the chamber I'm plannin' on aimin'
Goddammit, you know that the damage is done
Bitch I'm emotional 'cause I'm in stress
I'm not supposed to go through this, I guess
So in conclusion, since you like rappers that's killin' that pussy
I'm killin' myself

She say, ooh, Daddy, ooh, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Ooh, fake smile, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
She say, ooh, no emotion, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa

Swagger down pat; call my shit Patricia
Young Money militia and I am the commissioner
You no wan' start Weezy ‘cause the 'F' is for finisher
So misunderstood, but what's a world without enigma?
Two bitches at the same time; synchronized swimmers
Got the girl twisted ‘cause she open when you twist her
Never met the bitch, but I fuck her like I missed her
Life is the bitch, and death is her sister
Sleep is the cousin—what a fuckin' family picture
You know Father Time, and we all know Mother Nature
It's all in the family, but I am of no relation
No matter who's buyin', I'm a celebration
Black and white diamonds; fuck segregation
Fuck that shit, my money up, you niggas just Honey Nut
Young Money runnin' shit, and you niggas just runner-ups

Okay, I lost my mind, it's somewhere out there stranded
I think you stand under me if you don't understand me
Had my heart broken by this woman named Tammy
But hoes gon' be hoes, so I couldn't blame Tammy
Just talked to Moms, told her she the sweetest
I beat the beat up; call it self-defense
Swear, man, I be seein' through these niggas like sequins
Niggas think they He-Men, pow, pow, the end
Talkin' to myself because I am my own consultant
Married to the money, fuck the world; that's adultery
You full of shit, you close your mouth and let yo' ass talk
Young Money eatin', all you haters do is add salt
Stop playin', bitch, I got this game on deadbolt
Mind so sharp I fuck around and cut my head off
Real nigga all day and tomorrow
But these motherfuckers talkin' crazy like they jaw broke
Glass half empty, half full, I'll spill ya
Try me and run into a wall; outfielder
You know I'ma ball 'til they turn off the field lights
The fruits of my labor, I enjoy 'em while they still ripe
Bitch, stop playin', I do it like a king do
If these niggas animals, then I'ma have a mink soon
Tell 'em bitches I say put my name on the wall
I speak the truth, but I guess that's a foreign language to y'all
And I call it like I see it, and my glasses on
But most of y'all don't get the picture 'less the flash is on
Satisfied with nothin', you don't know the half of it
Young Money, Cash Money
Paper chasin', tell that paper, ""Look, I'm right behind ya""
Bitch, real Gs move in silence like lasagna
People say I'm borderline crazy, sorta kinda
Woman of my dreams, I don't sleep so I can't find her
You niggas are gelatin, peanuts to an elephant
I got through that sentence like a subject and a predicate
Yeah, with a swag you would kill for
Money too strong; pockets on bodybuilder
Jumped in a wishin' well, now wish me well
Tell 'em kiss my ass, call it kiss and tell

Word to my mama, I'm out of my lima bean
Don't wanna see what that drama mean
Get some Dramamine
Llama scream, hotter than summer sun on a Ghana queen
Now all I want is hits, bitch, Wayne signed a fiend
I played the side for you niggas that's tryna front, and see
Son of Gun, Son of Sam, you nigga's the son of me
Pause for this dumber speech, I glow like Buddha
Disturb me, and you'll be all over the flo' like Luda
Bitch, I flow like scuba, bitch, I'm bold like Cuba
And I keep a killer ho, she gon' blow right through ya
I be mackin', 'bout my stackin', now I pack like a mover
Shout to ratchet for backin' out on behalf of my shooter
Niggas think they high as I, I come laugh at your ruler
Cash Money cold, bitch, but our actions is cooler
Wayne, these niggas out they mind
I done told these fuck niggas so many times
That I keep them bucks steady on my mind
Tuck these, I fuck these on your mind, pause
To feed them, on my grind, did I get a little love
Keep throwin' my sign in the middle
Hit 'em up, piece on my side

Pockets gettin' too fat, no Weight Watchers, no lipo
Money talks, bullshit walks on a motherfucking tightrope
And I make that pussy tap out, I knock that pussy out cold
Nigga you get beat the crap out, but that's just how the dice roll
These hoes want that hose pipe, so I give all these hoes pipe
She get on that dick and stay on, all night, like porch lights

Call me Mr. Sandman, I'm sellin' all these hoes dreams
Got a white girl with big titties, flat-ass TV screen
I keep a bad bitch, call me the B.B. King
And you know I got that mouth out her
Then put that bitch out like a house fire
I'm killing these hoes like Michael Myers
I eat that cat just like a lion
And I can't trust none of these niggas
Can't trust none of these hoes
And I see your girl when I want, I got that ho TiVo'd
Got a red-ass bitch with a red-ass pussy
Nigga try me, that's a dead-ass pussy
Since y'all motherfuckers so blind to the fact
To tell you the truth, I don't care who's lookin'
All I know is I love my bitch, that pussy feel just like heaven on earth
Six feet deep, dick shovelin' the dirt, RIP — Rest In Pussy
Light that shit, then pass that shit, we gon get so smoked out
And then I went got locked up, every night I dreamt I broke out
One time for them pussy niggas, that's that shit I don't like

Haters can't see me: nose-bleed seats
And today I went shoppin' and talk is still cheap
I rock to the beat of my drum set
I been at the top for a while and I ain't jump yet
But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now jump up on that dick and do a full split!

Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
And looked back and told me, ""Baby, it's real.""
And I say, ""I ain't doubt you for a second.""
I squeeze it and I could tell how it feel
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here
Baby, you know the deal
And she bad, so maybe she won't, ugh
But shit, then again, maybe she will, yeah
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now
She will, yeah
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now
She will, she will, she will, ugh
Maybe for the money and the power and the fame right now
She will, she will, she will (Ugh)
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now
She will

Yeah

I tell her, ""Now go and pop that pussy for me!""
Haters can't see me, but them bitches still lookin' for me
And you could take it to the bank and deposit that
Put your two cents in and get a dollar back
Some people hang you out to dry like a towel rack
I'm all about I, give the rest of the vowels back
I like my girl thick, not just kinda fine
Eat her 'til she cry—call that ""wine 'n' dine""
Try to check me and I'ma have 'em checkin' pulses
They say, ""Choose wisely,"" that's why I was chosen
Rockin' like asphalt, it's the cash fault
Looked in the face of Death and took its mask off
Now, I like my house big and my grass soft
I like my girl face south and her ass north
But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now hop up on that dick and do a full split!

Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
And looked back and told me, ""Baby, it's real.""
And I say, ""I ain't doubt you for a second.""

And go anywhere but here, baby, you know the deal

Uh, but shit, then again, maybe she will
Do it for the realest niggas
In the fuckin' game right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas

Young Money!
You dig?
Mack, I'm going in

A millionaire, I'm a Young Money millionaire
Tougher than Nigerian hair
My criteria compared to your career just isn't fair
I'm a venereal disease, like a menstrual bleed
Through the pencil, and leak on the sheet of the tablet in my mind
‘Cause I don't write shit, ‘cause I ain't got time
‘Cause my seconds, minutes, hours go to the almighty dollar
And the almighty power of that ch-cha-cha-chopper
Sister, brother, son, daughter, father; mother-fuck a copper
Got the Maserati dancin' on the bridge, pussy poppin'
Tell the coppers: ""Ha-ha-ha-ha
You can't catch him, you can't stop him""
I go by them goon rules: if you can't beat 'em, then you pop 'em
You can't man 'em, then you mop 'em
You can't stand 'em, then you drop 'em
You pop 'em ‘cause we pop 'em like Orville Redenbacher

Motherfucker, I'm ill

A million here, a million there
Sicilian bitch with long hair,
 
with coke in her derriere
Like smoking the thinnest air
I open the Lamborghini, hopin' them crackers see me
Like, ""Look at that bastard Weezy!""
He's a beast, he's a dog, he's a mothafuckin' problem
Okay, you're a goon, but what's a goon to a goblin?
Nothin', nothin', you ain't scarin' nothin'
On some faggot bullshit: call 'em Dennis Rodman
Call me what you want, bitch! Call me on my Sidekick!
Never answer when it's private, damn, I hate a shy bitch
Don't you hate a shy bitch? Yeah, I ate a shy bitch
She ain't shy no more, she changed her name to My Bitch
Yeah, nigga, that's my bitch, so when she ask
For the money when you through, don't be surprised, bitch!
And it ain't trickin' if you got it
But you like a bitch with no ass: You ain't got shit
Motherfucker, I'm ill, not sick
And I'm okay, but my watch sick,
 yeah, my drop sick
Yeah, my Glock sick, 
and my knot thick — I'm it

Motherfucker, I'm ill

See, they say I'm rappin' like B.I.G., Jay, and 2Pac
André 3000, where is Erykah Badu at? Who that?
Who that said they gon' beat Lil Wayne?
My name ain't Bic, but I keep that flame, man
Who that one that do that, boy?
You knew that true that, swallow
And I be the shit, now you got loose bowels
I don't owe you like two vowels
But I would like for you to pay me by the hour
And I'd rather be pushin' flowers
Than to be in the pen sharin' showers
Tony told us this world was ours
And the Bible told us every girl was sour
Don't play in her garden and don't smell her flower
Call me Mr. Carter or Mr. Lawn Mower
Boy, I got so many bitches, like I'm Mike Lowrey
Even Gwen Stefani said she couldn't doubt me
Motherfucker, I say ""Life ain't shit without me""
Chrome lips pokin' out the coupe, look like it's poutin'
I do what I do, and you do what you can do about it
Bitch, I can turn a crack rock into a mountain — dare me
Don't you compare me, ‘cause there ain't nobody near me
They don't see me but they hear me
They don't feel me but they fear me
I'm illy,

Don’t Cry,Tha Carter V,2018.0,"Yeah
C5

Don't cry, don’t go
Won't lie, I fuckin' love you, whoa!

Why y’all staring into the clouds
Am I rising or they comin' down?
I see death around the corner
And the U-turn sign's lookin' like a smile
What do I do now? Who gon' find me, how?
Nowhere to turn but around and round
Just another nigga that done lost his head
No, a fucking king that forgot his crown
I am not number one, it's true
I'm number 9-27-82
Color blind even if I may be blue
A lot on my plate, ain't my favorite food
But I’m hungry, so hungry
Need my family tree next to a money tree
With a bunch of leaves in the Garden of Eden
With a bunch of Eves, no fruit punch for me
I sip from the Fountain of Youth
So if I die young, blame the juice
Bury me in New Orleans
Tombstone reads: ""Don’t cry, stay tuned.""
Bring me back to life
Got to lose a life just to have a life
But if heaven's as good as advertised
I want a triple extension on my motherfuckin’ afterlife
Rest in paradise

Don't cry (Don't cry, don't cry), don’t go (Why, oh why?)
Won't lie, I fuckin' love you, whoa!
Don't cry (Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry)
Don't go (Why, oh why, oh why, oh why?)
Won't lie (Don't cry, don't cry)
I fuckin' love you, whoa! (Don't cry, don't cry)

Talent is God-given, be grateful
Fame is not a given, be humble
And conceit is self-driven, drive carefully
Stay in your own lane, seat buckled
And sometimes when there is no music
We toot our own horns, rum-bum-bum-bum
That woman carried the future
And Tunechi was born like, ""dun-dun-dun-dun-dun""
Don't call it a comeback
It was dark, now the sun back
Hit me hard, but I punched back
The wheels fell off, I rode the hubcap
Is it suicide or it's do or die?
It's newer days and it's bluer skies
I told myself, ""It's just you and I""
Then the breeze came and it blew my mind
Lord knows who I'm there for
I give my last breath of air for
Mama tell me to be careful
Voice in my head give me an earful
But I got mind control over my control
I lost control but knew I'd find control
I let God control what I cannot control
Can't control the tears, let 'em drop and roll

Don't cry (Don't cry, don't cry)
Don't go (Why, oh why, oh why?)
Won't lie (Don't cry), I fuckin' love you, whoa!
(Triple extension on my motherfuckin' afterlife, rest in paradise)
Don't cry (Don't cry, don't cry)
Don't go (Why, oh why, oh why?)
Won't lie, I fuckin' love you, whoa! (Don't cry)

Ugh, gunpowder in my hourglass
Niggas faker than some flour in a powder bag
Yeah, I put it down like my hands hurting
I'm on a natural high,
 but I land perfect
Some of us are lovers, most of y'all haters
But I put up a wall, and they just wallpaper
So love or hate me, I stay hate-free
They say we learn from mistakes; why, that's why they mistake me
I got some weight on my shoulders, to me it's like feathers
All hail Weezy, call it bad weather
I stick to the script, I memorize the lines
Cause life is a movie that I've seen too many times

Times have changed, but fuck it get a new watch
I still got the vision like a line between two dots
Young Money's eating, the label getting fatter
And yea, the tables turned, but I'm still sitting at 'em
I'm a bad motherfucker cause the good die young
Everybody selling dreams, I'm too cheap to buy one
Man, when that cookie crumble, everybody want a crumb
Shoot that hummingbird down, hummingbird don't hum

Who else is really trying to fuck with Hollywood Cole
I'm with Marley G's bro
Flying Holly Grove chicks to my Hollywood shows
And I wanna tell you something that you probably should know
This that Slum Dog Millionaire Bollywood flow and uh
My real friends never hearing from me
Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
That's why I pick and choose, I don't get shit confused
I got a small circle, I'm not with different crews
We walk the same path, but got on different shoes
Live in the same building, but we got different views
I got a couple cars, I never get to use
Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in twos
And these days all the girls are down to roll
I hit the strip club, and all them bitches find a pole
Plus I be sipping, so this shit is moving kinda slow
Just tell my girl to tell her friend that it's time to go

Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven is right above it
We on, it's Young Money motherfucker
If you ain't running with it, run from it motherfucker
Alright, now somebody show some money in this bitch
And I got my b's with me like some honey in this bitch, you dig
I got my gun in my boo purse
And I don't bust back, because I shoot first

Meet me on the fresh train, yes I'm in the building
You just on the list of guest names
And all of my riders do not give a fuck, X-Games
Guns turn you boys into pussies, sex change
And I smoke 'til I got chest pains
And you niggas know I rep my gang like Jesse James
Women are possessive, and they wanna possess Wayne
I been fly so long I fell asleep on the fucking plane
Skinny pants and some Vans
Call me Triple A, get my advance in advance, amen
As the world spinning, dance in my hands
Life is a beach, I'm just playing in the sand
Uh, wake up and smell the pussy
You niggas can't see me, but never overlook me
I'm on a paper trail and ain't no telling where it took me
Yeah, and I ain't a killer but don't push me

Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven is right above it
We on, it's Young Money motherfucker

Beautiful black woman, I bet that bitch look better red
Limping off tour, cause I made more on my second leg

Ball on automatic start
I can hand it to Drake or do a quarterback draw
Wildcat offense, check the paw prints
We in the building, you niggas in apartments
Uh, now come on be my blood donor
Flow so nice you ain't gotta put a rug on her
Do it big and let the small fall under that
Damn where you stumbled at? From where they make Gumbo at
Kane got the fucking beat jumping like a jumping jack
And you know me, I get on this bitch and have a heart attack

Puff, puff, bro; I don't huff though
Yellow diamonds up close, catch a sunstroke
At your front door with a gun stowed
""Knock, knock. Who's there?"" is how it won't go
This the jungle, so have the utmost
For the nutzos, and we nuts, so

We throw up gang signs, she throw up dope
Dreadlock hang down like you dun know
Put the green in the bag like a lawnmower
Hair trigger pulled back like a cornrow
Extra clip in the stash like a console
Listenin' to Bono, you listen to Donald

Swizzy, he the chef, I like my lunch gross
Just look up, bro, there the Scuds go
I see the shovel, but where did bruh go?
Hmm, to the unknown
Only way he comin' back is through his unborns
If you see what's in my bag, think I'm a drug lord
It's empty when I give it back, now where's the uproar?

Hate in my heart, love in my mind
I seen nights full of pain, days are the same
You keep the sunshine, save me the rain
I search but never find, hurt but never cry
I work and forever try, but I'm cursed, so never mind
And it's worse, but better times seem further and beyond
The top gets higher the more that I climb
The spot gets smaller and I get bigger
Tryin' to get in where I fit in, no room for a nigga
But soon for a nigga it be on, motherfucker
‘Cause all this bullshit done made me strong, motherfucker

So I pick the world up
And I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Bitch, I'ma pick the world up
And I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
And I could die now, rebirth, motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker
I'm gone, motherfucker, I'm gone

I know what they don't wanna tell you
Just hope you're heaven-sent, and you're hell-proof
I walk up in the world and cut the lights off
And confidence is a stain they can't wipe off
My word is my pride
But wisdom is bleak, and that's a word from the wise
Served to survive,
 murdered and bribed
And when it got too heavy I put my burdens aside

So I can pick the world up
And I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Bitch, I'ma pick the world up
And I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
And I could die now, rebirth, motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker

It hurts, but I never show
This pain you'll never know
If only you could see just how lonely and how cold
And frostbit I've become
My back's against the wall
When push come to shove
I just stand up and scream: ""Fuck 'em all!""

Man, it feels like these walls are closin' in
This roof is cavin' in, up it's time to raise it, then
Your days are numbered like pages in
My book of rhymes;
 got 'em cookin', boy
This crooked mind of mines got 'em all shook
And scared to look in my eyes
I stole that fuckin' clock: I took the time
And I came up from behind and pretty much snuck up
And butt-fucked this game up
Better be careful when you bring my name up
Fuck this fame, that ain't what I came to claim
But the game ain't gonna be the same on the day that I leave it
But I swear, one way or another
I'ma make these fuckin' haters believe it
I swear to God, won't spare the rod
I'm a man of my words, so your fuckin' heads better nod
Or I'ma fuck around in this bitch and roast everybody
Sleep on me, that pillow is where your head'll lie
Permanently, bitch, it's beddy-bye
This world is my Easter egg, yeah, prepare to die!
My head is swole
My confidence is up, this stage is my pedestal
I'm unstoppable, Incredible Hulk
You're trapped in my medicine ball
I could run circles around you so fast your fuckin' head'll spin, dog
I'll split your cabbage and your lettuce and olives, I'll fuckin'—

Pick the world up and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head

If I die today, remember me like John Lennon
Buried in Louis, I’m talking all brown linen, huh

Talk stupid, get ya head popped
I got that Esther, bitch I’m Redd Foxx
Big B’s, Red Sox, I get money to kill time, dead clocks
You fucking with a nigga who won’t give a fuck
Empty the clip then roll the window up
Pussy nigga sweet, them niggas Cinnabon
I’m in a red bitch, she said she finna cum
200 thou' on a chain, I don’t need a piece
That banana clip, let Chiquita speak
Dark shades, Eazy E, five letters, YMCMB
Bitch ass nigga, pussy ass nigga
I see ya looking, with ya looking ass nigga
You know the rules, kill them all and keep moving
If I died today, it’d be a holiday, hanh

I’m not a star, somebody lied
I got a chopper in the car, so don’t make it come alive
Rip your ass apart, then I pull myself together
YMCMB, double M, we rich forever
The bigger the bullet, the more that bitch go ""Bang!""
Red on the wall, Basquiat when I paint
Red Lamborghini till I gave it to my bitch
My first home invasion, papi gave me 40 bricks
Son of a bitch, then I made a great escape
Ain't it funny, momma only son be bakin' cakes
Pull up in the sleigh, hop out like I’m Santa Claus
Niggas gather round, got gifts for each and all of y’all
Take it home and let it bubble, that's the double up
If you get in trouble, that just mean you fuckin' up
It’s a cold world, I need a bird to cuddle up
I call the plays, motherfucker, huddle up

I’m not a star, somebody lied
I got a chopper in the car, yeah",https://genius.com/Lil-wayne-john-lyrics
How to Love,Tha Carter IV,2011.0,"Cut the music up
A little louder

You had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in a corner trying put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had a love

When you was just a young’un, your looks were so precious
But now you're grown up, so fly it's like a blessing
But you can’t have a man look at you for five seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself, so when you got older
It seems like you came back ten times over
Now you’re sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder

See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in a corner tryning put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had a love

You had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn’t your fault, wasn't in your intentions
To be the one here talking to me, be the one listening
But I admire your poppin' bottles and dippin'
Just as much as you admire bartending and stripping
Baby, so don’t be mad, nobody else trippin'
You see a lot of crooks and crooks still crook

You had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had a love

See I just want you to know that you deserve the best
You’re beautiful, you’re beautiful
Yeah, and I want you to know
You’re far from the usual, far from the usual

You see you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
See you had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in this corner trying put it together
How to love, how to love
See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever

Two middle fingers that's up high to whom

Who knew that I am the guru with voodoo
That sued you to high hell
With shooters that shoot through the iron, man
And see through the con man and now he a dyin' man
I turned a goddamn into a God's Plan
Go over the diagram and get to the job, man
Watch for the spy cam
Sit back and watch and do not watch your watch hand
Give me some time, man

I am gon' swim 'til I come out on dry land or on the fryin' pan
No, we did not land on Plymouth Rock
But it landed on our land, now I'm just buyin' land

To keep it solid as a you know what I'm sayin'

If I taught you some shit, that's like Harvard, lil' bitch

I brought in this shit, the starters get benched
The orders get sent, then targets get hit
Billion dollar smile
I sell myself short if I grin, I'm bargainin' then

In the foreign car that I could talk to and shit

I'ma need a coupe, I won't need a roof
Flyer than Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice
I got the flow, I'm tryin' to see the roof
Didn't wear a bulletproof so I got shot and you can see the proof
Blind eyes could look at me and see the truth
Wonder if Stevie do?
But I'ma leave it to God, not Beaver, neither you
Cause I'ma murder Y, kill O, and even U
Man, I got Summer hatin' on me cause I'm hotter than the sun
Got Spring hatin' on me 'cause I ain't never sprung
Winter hatin' on me 'cause I'm colder than y'all
And I will never, I will never, I will never Fall
I'm being hated by the seasons
So fuck y'all who hatin' for no reason

Two words you never hear: ""Wayne quit!?""
Cause Wayne win, and they lose
I call 'em April babies, cause they fools
And when they snooze, we up!
Feet up, like a paraplegia
Or paraplegic? I parallel park
In that red-and-yellow thing; old school Atlanta Hawk
Like I'm from College Park, but I'm from Hollygrove
Now all my Bloods scream ""Soo-woo"" and ""Da-da-doe""
I know my role and I play it well
And I weigh it well, on my Libra scale
I suck a pussy, fuck a pussy, leave it there
Long hair, don't even care

Is that not why we came? And if not, then why bother?
Show no mercy in Murcielagos
I'm far from bein' the bastard that Marcy had fathered
Now my name's been mentioned with the martyrs
The Biggies and the Pacs and the Marleys and the Marcuses
Garvey; got me a molotov-cocktail flow
Even if you box well, can't stop the blows
Kaboom! The Roc Boy in the room
The dope boy I just came off the spoon
Also, I'm so fly I'm on auto-
Pilot, while guys just stare at my wardrobe
I see Euros, that's right: plural
I took so much change from this rap game, it's your go
(Hey Mr. Carter) Young!

It's my go, yeah… And I'ma go so opposite of soft
Off the richter, Hector, Camacho Man, Randy Savage
Far from average, above status–quo, flow so pro
I know, I ride slow, and when I pass
They say, ""What up, killa?"" Man, stop bringin' up my past
And next time you mention Pac, Biggie, or Jay-Z

It's gonna be on both feet, never knees in the dirt
And you can try me, fucker, but when I squeeze, it hurt

At the funeral parlor, drippin' tears down my sleeve

My country 'tis of thee
Sweet land of kill em all and let em die

The end of time is like a hour away

Damn, military minded, lost and can’t find it
The stars on the flag are never shining
Uh, I saw a butterfly in hell today
Will I die or go to jail today?
Cause I live by the sword and die by the sword
Heard police was lookin' for me, I’mma hide by a broad
Shootin' stars in my pocket; bitch, sit on my rocket
I’m wired out the socket, but still shocking
Everybody wanna tell me what I need
You can play a role in my life but not the lead
If there’s food for thought then I’m guilty of greed
Mama said take what you want – I took heed yea
Now let it breathe, yea

Back to life, back to reality
Been eating my girl and she’s so sweet, got cavities
Granted we do it for vanity not humanity
But what’s appealing to me is under banana trees, love
I go so hard, I tried to pay homage but I was overcharged
Ain’t that a bitch? I’m just a nut tryna bust a nut, in a nut shell
Used to say fuck the police, now I say fuck jail
Same shit, different air freshener
I don’t play, boy, I ain’t Hugh Hefner
Tryna be a step ahead, but a few feet behind
Two fingers to my head, pop! Peace of mind
I be in the cloud, cloud number 9
And I just fucked the clock and let it come to time
It’s a cold world, I put on a mink
There’s a chain of command, I’m the missing link

God bless Amerika
This ole' godless Amerika
I heard tomorrow ain’t promised today
And I’m smoking on them flowers, catch the bouquet

Here we live by the sword and die by the sword
Heard police was lookin' for me, I’mma hide by a broad
Shootin' stars in my pocket; bitch, sit on my rocket

Unless you go and take the neighbors' food
And be afraid of who, I made the loot
When money went from army green to navy blue
I said salute, bulletproof, I gave 'em proof
Sometimes feel like my head a screw, twisted like tornadoes too
Man, I'ma need some Krazy Glue
Her walls is what I'm breaking through
Her nails, she gone break a few
You can never break me down, and I can't hit the brakes for you
(errr!)

You cannot break down what can't be broken
Out of all the rankless, I was chosen (Yeah)
When all of the lights, they get low (Low)
And all of the curtains, they close (They close)
You cannot break down (You can't) what can't be broken

G-code, G-code, we can't break the G-code
We bros (Can't be broken)
We bros, we bros, we can't break for these hoes
G-code (Can't be broken)

I ain't finna break or fix the brakes
You emulate, I'm laughing in your face
Now fix your face, I can't disintegrate, 'cause I facilitate a mil' a day
For like a million days
At least the bills are paid, the children safe
Want to get away? No, I'm here to stay
I'm really great, but don't discriminate
'Cause I done seen a mirror break behind a pretty face
You stickin' out your chest, your titties fake
Don't make me pick your fate
I'm pickin' out a mate, she get replaced
The heart was built to break
I'm smoking icky, watching Ricki Lake
I got a lawyer that turn any case into a pillow case
My killers straight, let's do some Q&A
You saw the news today
Got news to break and rules to break
It hurt to say, they want to get Lil Tune to break
It's worth the wait, commercial break

You cannot break down what can't be broken

Out of all the rankless, I was chosen
When all of the lights, they get low
And all of the curtains, they close

Woo, this that shit they didn't want me on

Don't need sugar, I need cream, I'm dark and strong
The garbage man puttin' on cologne, aroma wrong
I'm on, I'm on, this that shit they didn't want

Black your eye like will.i.am, you Willy Wonka
That's me in the Lamb', I'm disappearin' like Jimmy Hoffa

French kiss a bitch, she don't speak French, can't kiss and tell
I push his ass in a wishin' well, then wish him well
Sippin' syrup like ginger ale, but I'm the quickest snail
From here to Hell, I hear them hail, I give them hell
I'm spittin' hail,
 
I'm Clinton, well, I did inhale
These niggas frail, they Chip and Dale, they little gals
Watch me act a donkey, then pin a tail, spit out your nails

I know how to hack a jeweler ward and not computers
I meditate like a Buddhist, holy ramen noodles

I been a boo-boo since ga-ga goo-goo and Dada, FUBU
Make everybody that knew you boo-hoo, I got them spooked too
I drive in neutral, shock the future like Dr. Luther
I'm not a chooser, your mom a cougar, I'll sock it to her
My cocaine white as a white beluga,
 
I like bazookas
I'm high as lunar,
 
I'm wilder than tigers, Nikes, Pumas
Woo, this that shit you didn't want me on
My weed louder than underarms and car alarms
Cheers, I said, ""Surprise,"" but couldn't party long
I got to get back to the grind and the drawin' board
But all this fuckin' artist drawin' is the art of war
These niggas soft as teddy bears, talk to Marky Mark
I wet your block, leave it a waterpark, broad or dark
I whip the work like tartar sauce, you want it hard or raw, huh?

Uh, glory, hallelujah
Holy shit, I'm the shit, Porta-Potty Tunechi
Unload the Glock profusely when sortin' out confusion
Your motor mouth keep vroomin', I'm goin' Tony Stewart
I'm on the fluid, I'm ruined, I'm cold as Boston Bruins
Lost in the shoo-shoo and who's who and I lost influence
Lost my point of view 'til I find a mirror, start talkin' to it
It told me the truth, it said I'm the shit and you party poopin'
Lord, oh, Lord

Am I talkin' crazy? Too much coffee maybe
I smell like money, I know broke niggas feel nauseated
The broads elated, my boys are faded, my car's the latest
My bars the greatest, they rated X like Marvel made it
She caught the babies, she barfed the babies, they orphans maybe
We got that white girl like in the '80s, that Marcia Brady
I dicked Tracy like Warren Beatty, I'm warm as Haiti
I'm armed and lazy, I'm sprayin' until my arms is lazy
Pardon my mental, I'm higher than Continental
Went from flyin' cockroaches to flyin' without credentials
That's private,
 
tell the pilot, ""Be quiet, we need our privacy""
Throw you off this bitch if you wired, justifiably
Hustle wit' a motive, you know this, I'm wit' my whoadies
No snakes, no rodents, no ad-libs, no chorus
No stress, no worries, hook you to a respiratory
It's self-explanatory, the glory is mandatory, glory

Uh, glory, hallelujah
Holy shit, I can't hold this shit, my bowel's looser
My towel's newer, my powder room is for powder-users
You see rolled up dollar bills filled wit' snot and mucus
My tires Lucas, my driver's cruisin', my partner's ruthless
My flower's rootless, my pocket's roofless, she poppin' roofies

It’s Good,Tha Carter IV,2011.0,"You who are rich and whose troubles are few
May come around to see my point of view
What price the crown of a king on his throne
When you’re chained in the dark all alone?

I’m real as they come, I follow the rules
I’m still in the hood but I probably should move
Made enough money, I don’t fuck around
I just felt they needed me so I stuck around
Feds got my man, shit is real son
'Cause my godson just became my real son
Think life is a game but all you get is a turn
You live and you learn, either you freeze or you burn
Kush in the air, I’m pushin' the gears
Love turned into hate, hate turned into fear
If it ain't right, I don’t sign the deal
Shoot me in the watch, I got time to kill
Gasoline, propane
Ain't no salary cap in the dope game
Ain't no collective bargainin' on cocaine
So in other words, nigga, do your thing

Mind in one place, heart in another
Please pardon my brother, he’s just angry at you niggas
Who don't have your heart in your rap shit
And got too fuckin' comfy
'Cause we still fuckin' hungry, Young Money, got the munchies
Faded, fuckin' faded, aw yeah I'm fuckin' faded
They tellin’ lies about me, aw yeah, I must've made it
Rikers Island on this flow, eight months for that pistol
But at least they had some bad bitches workin’ in that shit hole
Three visits later, I went and did it major
So fuck the judge, and the jury, and the litigator
Watchin' all these kids who thought they had it figured out
And then November came, they let my nigga out

Uh, stop playin', I ain't with that bullshit
Niggas act like bitches, Sheneneh, oh my goodness
This is Wayne’s world, and y’all are just some tourists
Give me three wishes, I wish, I wish, I wish you would bitch
Brand new pussy, pussy good as baby powder
Two Glock .40′s, nigga you got 80 problems
Swimmin’ in the money, I'ma need some fuckin' goggles
It's better to give, but we don't give a fuck about 'em
I just came home, shit done got real, ho
Lil' Weezyana, the boot nigga, steel toe
I ain't workin' with a full deck but I deal ho
I just touched down, kick the motherfuckin' field goal
Talkin ’bout baby money? I got your baby money
Kidnap your bitch, get that ""how-much-you-love-your-lady"" money
I know you fake nigga, press your brakes nigga
I’ll take you out, that’s a date nigga
I'm a grown-ass Blood, stop playin' with me
Play asshole and get an ass whippin’

How to Hate,Tha Carter IV,2011.0,"She owes me everything and she knows it
I've seen all the scenes in this movie, and she blows it at the end
She keeps talking to me, cause she knows that I'm a friend
But I can't keep hearing it over and over again
I was the one that you came to
When you broke up with your boyfriend, man, fuck him
Girl I was the one, that told you fuck them other niggas
And you still went and fucked them other niggas
Most people learn from the bad things
I hope that you learn and don't crash and burn in the fast lane
But if you read this letter then you caught me
This should explain all the ways that you taught me

How to hate a bitch that owe you everything
At least a wedding ring, moving on to better things
So don't you call me talking bout them other fools
I'm not good enough for you, I thought that we was cool
If you need a shoulder to cry on, girl I won't listen
I'm through fucking with these bitch ass bitches

And I don't love them hoes
But don't fuck up with Wayne cause when it ""Waynes"" it pours
No really, I'm on my ""fuck that bitch"" shit
You used to be the shit, but now you ain't shit, bitch
I had a red bone, but she be tripping though
All that bullshit is for the birds, she was pigeon toed
She used to always say, fuck my niggas
And when I went to jail, she fucked my niggas
Well, I guess I'm single for the night
And you can sit right on my middle finger for the night
And if I sound mad, then you caught me
But this shit explains that you're the one that taught me

How to hate a bitch that owe you everything
At least a wedding ring, moving on to better things
So don't you call me talking bout them other fools
I'm not good enough for you, I thought that we was cool
If you need a shoulder to cry on, girl I won't listen
I'm through fucking with these bitch ass bitches

Coconut Ciroc
Forgive and forget, bitch I already forgot
I'm over the bitch, and she over the top
They say love is the key, somebody changed the lock
Well, and I wish I never met ya
And I heard you're doing you, and you heard I'm doing better
And all I had to do was put two and two together
But that just makes four, but not forever, damn
So much for being the perfect couple
I put in overtime, I was working doubles
I wish you the best, good luck boo
Weezy F, for ""Fuck you""

No ain't nothing going on
Girl I'm moving on, just take your ass home
Get away from here girl, I'm so glad you're gone
This is the last song I'm writing for you
Now I see how you can be
I don't want you 'round you me all you do is down me girl
How many years I tried to get ya
Don't even text my phone when it hit ya, cause girl done taught me

How to hate a bitch that owe you everything
At least a wedding ring, moving on to better things

Ever since I been famous my time has been racing
My motives are basic, this life I've been chasing
These hearts I've been breaking
And these girls I been tasting don't never get naked
They like it in a head lock fuck 'em from behind
Fuck 'em with their clothes on, put it to the side
Feelings to the side like a don do
Get 'em wet, let it slide like a sunroof
Got goals, got dreams, got a hotel-crib
Got niggas that'll die for the prince
Got my city on lock, XO 'til the death

I'mma leave that ass smoking like a Amsterdam tourist man
These hoes love Wayne, got a bunch of dimes, that's chump change
This shit is target practice and your bitch is my gun range

My tongue is a uzi, my dick is a AK
My tongue is a uzi, my dick is a AK
My tongue go brrrr, my dick go bahh
My tongue go brrrr, my dick go bahh, bitch!

Lay on that bed, open your mouth
This pussy so clean like soap in your mouth
I do my lil' dance, he scoping me out
If that dick like a tree watch me build a treehouse
Ok, the baddest bitch in this bitch, got the fattest clique in this bitch
You might drown, you better start doggy paddling in this bitch
I'm Trin, B nigga? Queen nigga, sleep in this pussy, dream nigga
I stay on that dick like a fucking balance beam nigga
Hair pull, neck grab, don't fuck with hoes that backstab
Don't fuck with niggas that ain't got shit, if I fucked a nigga then that's my dick
My mouth a jacuzzi, my pussy a safe place
Fuck me 'til daybreak, then you can go skate, Trina",https://genius.com/Lil-wayne-wowzers-lyrics

Shout out Guru for sendin' me the beat, too
Young Angel, Young Lion
More Life, no dyin'
Yeah, alright, I got it, yeah

Super Bowl goals, I'm at the crib with Puff
He got Kaepernick on the phone, he in a whole different mode
Angel hair at 2AM for Bey and Hov
Just to show 'em how I treat the city like my humble abode
Ayy, tell me if TD Bank is approvin' loans
I'm thinkin' of payin' Wayne what Universal owes
My nigga spent a lifetime goin' platinum and gold
He should own half of the label, shit outta control
Somebody get Larry Jackson on the phone
I need some ownership if we pressin' go
'Cause business is boomin' on behalf of me
I need a bite outta the Apple like Adam and Eve
We gon' have to break the billi' curse
I need my paper long like ""A Milli"" verse
Or too long like a sentence from a Philly judge
Fuck is the point in all the beefin' when we really blood?
Nobody wins when the family feuds, nigga
Everybody gotta eat, we can't exclude niggas
I make the crib, expandin' pools and expandin' rooms
Addin' Hammam Spas with tannin' booths, nigga
That's truth, no boost, nigga
But this isn't all about callin' truce
I'm still dishin' out verbal abuse
That shit could get re-introduced
If somebody got somethin' they urgin' to prove, nigga
Inspirin' to the youth
New Years Eve, lookin' like a royal flush
Wait, we all in the same suit
I'm Hall of Fame in the booth, nigga
My karma makin' the news, nigga

If I ever see Trump, he better salute niggas

I could care less 'bout your squad, I don't connect when I'm flyin'
I'm on a jet and it's mine, I just hope the weather is fine
I took the jet to Dubai, I took the jet to Milan
I took the jet way to Africa, shout out my nigga Akon
Your bitch sweatin' my squad, please get the sweat out her eye
I put the dick in her spine, I fucked the bitch in her prime
Don't get my credit declined, give all the credit to Moms
I flipped the bird at the Bird – hey, what's for dinner? Popeyes
These chickens got bird flu, and they chirp, chirp too
Always sung, never flew, these boys Hot Girls too
If money grow on trees, I climb and rest in that bitch
Build a treehouse and knock the bird nest out that bitch
Stuck my neck out and shit, then got the heck out that shit
And when I did, I took the special effect out of that shit
Tunechi F 'round this bitch
The best thing left 'round this bitch
All you niggas some bitches, I feel like Hef 'round this bitch
You call her Stephanie, I call her Steph 'round this bitch
Now back to whippin' the baby on some step mama shit
I come direct with my shit, I come correct with my shit
A blank check on your face, put some respek on my shit
Branches startin' to shake, here comes the leaves, get the rake
I want my piece of the cake, it should be sweeter than cake
Here come the leaves, get the rake, and we ain't leavin' the rake
We made the cleanest escape, although I bleeped in your face
You playin' wit the right one today
Your flag is a white one today
You wearin' em tight ones today
Check me or write one today
You playin' with fire today
The Angel and Lion are greats
Oh my God, lightning strikin' twice in this place
Should we make a wish or should we make it right in this place?
All this motherfuckin' beef, I need some rice on this plate
Talked to your wifey today, she feelin' triflin' she say
Talked to the sniper, he say he aimin' at diapers today
Pick you off like pickin' peppers, Peter Piper today
So tell your squad I say ""BLAOW"" like Spice 1 would say
It's Mortal Kombat tonight, it's Street Fighter today
I'm Major Bison, Drizzy lit like Raiden light up the place
You see blue face hundreds 'til you white in the face
Oh my God, it feel like I done life in this place
But swear to God, I got money doin' life in my safe
Put on the gloves like MJ, go from OG to OJ
I make you pay attention then rip your receipt in your face
This for Cita and Nae, this for my people and bae
I got three sons of a gun, them niggas keep me on safe
Hol' up, I am the black god to the church
I am the fat boy to dessert
I am the landlord to the first, got two bangers
One of them go ""bada boom,"" one of them go ""bada bing""
I taught these hoes how to love, I taught these boys how to lean
I'm high in the sky and I twinkle
The eyes don't lie 'til you blink 'em
Keep the iron for the wrinkles
The mansion came with the sprinklers
I want Arabian wealth
You snakes come make me a belt

Yeah, was on the outside, looking in this bitch
But now I’m in this bitch
Yeah, I'm in this bitch
Tunechi, you a genius
Looked in the mirror said
""Don't let the money come between us""
I’m loaded, loaded at my earliest convenience
But fuck 'em, I feel like I got ten middle fingers
I'm sippin', sippin' in this bitch and poppin' uppers
Girl, take this, this that shit that give a flower color
And some bitch named Wonder Woman told me not to wonder
The crumbs, you only see 'em when the cookie crumble
Real shit, nigga, my candle still lit
Had to swallow my pride, though, swear it tastes like spearmint
Big up to my nigga with a strap on 'em
I never turn my back on ’em
’Cause nigga act like they cool with ya
But a lot of these niggas be transformers
A lot of these players be bench-warmers
The game ain't easy, but it’s fair, nigga
I'mma sit in this throne so long
'Til it's a fucking rocking chair, nigga
Bad bitch play with my hair, nigga
Said, ""Relax, Tune, baby don’t stress out""

Please swallow, I had my share of dirty diapers
Real shit, pussy niggas on that guilt trip
It'll be on in a heartbeat
You can't hear no pussy nigga's shit skip
I fear God, never fear men
Give back, never give in
Beat odds, never beat women
Keep an open mind, let 'em peek in it
Reach highs, never reach limits
Need minds, I don't need plenty
This C5, this for BI and Left Eye, and T-Boz
When I seen Chilli at the Floyd fight
I almost asked her to creep with me
But I was young, and I held my tongue
But with that tongue, I just keep spitting
So it all worked out

And now I'm in this bitch
And life said, ""Tune, you knew me for way too long""
I never change, you know I been this bitch

""Let it all work out, let it all work out"" (Yeah)
""Let it all work out, let it all work out""

Tunechi, you a monster
Looked in the mirror, but you wasn't there, I couldn't find ya
I'm lookin' for that big, old smile, full of diamonds
Instead, I found this letter you ain't finished writin'
It read, ""I'm sorry for even apologizing""
I tried, compromising and went kamikaze
I found my momma's pistol where she always hide it
I cry, put it to my head and thought about it
Nobody was home to stop me, so I called my auntie
Hung up, then put the gun up to my heart and pondered
Too much was on my conscience to be smart about it
Too torn apart about it, I aim where my heart was pounding
I shot it, and I woke up with blood all around me
It's mine, I didn't die, but as I was dying
God came to my side and we talked about it
He sold me another life and he made a prophet

Yeah, and he said
""Let it all work out"" (Yeah)
""Let it all work out""
(I'm still in this bitch)
""Let it all work out""
(Yeah, thank God 'cause I'm still in this bitch)
""Let it all work out""

""Let it all work out""

CNN, I got news for you haters
I'm a nasty ass nigga, ask your bitch, I ain't lying
69, that's a favor for a favor

Them hoes bitin' they lip, cause when I say shit like that she feel some type of way
I hit it from the front, from the side, from the back, I hit it all type of ways
She throw it at me like I'm just one strike away
Sometimes life is hard to swallow, but she like to taste
Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding my lawyer fight the case
I got them flowers in me, I feel like a vase
Monsters in my closet no more closet space
Niggas want to be this fly, too many flights to take

Enough with the small talk, my girl pussy is a water-park
Every little thing I do turn her on; that's autostart
I kiss every single body part, her body is a work of art
I'm way too high, her skirt too short, I think I love her, it was just a thought
I pop up in that coupe 'bout to go back to the future
And she said, ""Tune, not in my mouth,"" damn you should've said it sooner
I be shittin' on these niggas, like I'm sippin' Metamucil
And we smokin' on that gas, pass it like ""excuse you""
And it's 6-6-2's Piru all day, my nigga
Before these niggas play with us, they'll play dead, my nigga
And if you lookin' for me, I'll be on these bitches' mind
These niggas chicken and I've never seen a chicken fly
My bitch been fussin' at me about nothin'
Ain't no tellin' what she'd do if I replace her
Like bae, I'm straight, there's plenty fish and I'm bait
We can't even have a decent conversation

I pop the seal on my sip and she be like, ""See, you gon' drink your life away""
Bitch it's my life, my life, my life shout out Mary J
And tell them boys that beef tastes like a slice of cake
And old folks get shot too, they write down license plates
I hope that ho don't call sayin' her cycle late
All this fucking gotta stop, but I need tighter brakes
And don't run from this dick girl, I don't like to chase
I wax that ass, she make that Mr. Miyagi face
And she ain't all that pretty, but I like her shape
They say numbers don't lie, she shaped like a 8
She say she ain't no dyke, but she gon' dyke today
It's curtains for these niggas I feel like some drapes
.
We turnt up niggas, burnt up, stop the microwave
This shit might cost us our life, but that's the price we pay
I'm hotter than the peppers Peter Piper ate
This that Dedication 5, whattup 5?

Ay Tune' I gotta turn up on the D5 man!
Hustle Gang, bang, green mean, anybody get it
Anything we'll do for the paper
And we live this shit, talk slick get kill't
Got nothin' but a tool for a hater (Spent 100K on my wrist nigga!)
This flooded rollie make you feel some type of way (I know it do!)
Your ho be on me, know you feel some type of way (I take your ho!)
The car I'm drivin' make you feel some type of way (They can't afford this nigga!)
The cash I gettin' make you feel some type of way 
(Bankrolls-R-Us!)
This type of way, know you feel some type of way (Hustle Gang my nigga!)
That shit ain't hot, we out here poppin' that's all I can say 
(G.D.O.D!)
My only problem is tryin' to decide what I'mma drive today 
(Hustle Gang my nigga!)
We shine all in they face, I know they feel some type of way
I wake up in a multi-million dollar crib get dressed I plan on having a nicer day
When these punk ass rappers keep my name in they mouth, like they some type of gay
You know me dog, so watch what you say (You better watch your mouth!)
We ain't playing no games with your lame ass nigga, fuckboy you can die today (I swear you can!)
I keep a chopper in my backseat, actually it's my Glock partner (My Glock, partner!)
Play crazy if you want to, fuck around and get shot partner (Get shot partner!)
I don't like these niggas, and really fuck these niggas
Talk crazy in ya raps if you want, when you see me you won't touch me nigga! (Won't touch me niggas!)
Ball all around in my flip flop, you think TIP soft? Well then why don’t you try me
If you really gon' be dramatic, we gon' to need some music, they queuein' the violin
I'm talking slow singing, flower bringing
Empty a clip in you earing, and you chest thing, and you out the door
This flooded rollie make you feel some type of way (I know it do!)

Fireballs reflect off the frames of the pictures
She's not at all impressed with the flames or the flickers
But take her for a walk on the moon she wear her slippers
The end of the world is coming soon, I’ma miss it
The sky is falling down, I am falling for her quicker
We hide amongst the clouds, then we pardon the enigma
High above the ground but I'm under her charisma
Her sound is in surround when I'm in her solar system

Praying to the ceiling
I bless her
As if she sneezed
Must be the weather

Wow
Leave her
To me and she'll be smiling
Every single time you see her
From ear-to-ear
I want to be beside her when she sleep as she lay
Or we can stay awake and watch the next day

Panties are debated
Einstein; her head is the greatest

Oh yes I love her like her dad told her
No man
Would ever love her

I better be the only man

Lickin' it like an envelope
Mailin' it, sealin' it, read it
I have written down Victoria's Secret
Don't tell nobody
Don't share your body with nobody
Not even a finger
I will cut it off and let him keep it
That ass for Weezy, baby
And at my station
We have sex orientation
When I hit it she squint like them Orient Asians

Roll, like sushi""

Jumping off of a mountain into a sea of codeine
I'm at the top of the top, but, still I climb
And if I should ever fall, the ground will then turn to wine
Pop, pop
I feel like flying
Then I feel like frying
Then (I feel like dying)

Only once the drugs are done (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Do I feel like dying, I feel like dying (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Only once the drugs are done (Hahaha)
Do I feel like dying, I feel like dying (Psst!)

I can mingle with the stars, and throw a party on Mars
I am a prisoner locked up behind Xanax bars
I have just boarded a plane without a pilot
And violets are blue, roses are red
Daisies are yellow, the flowers are dead
Wish I could give you this feeling
I feel like buying
And if my dealer don't have no more
Then (I feel like dying) yeah

Only once the drugs are done (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Do I feel like dying, I feel like dying (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Only once the drugs are done (Hahaha)
Do I feel like dying, I feel like dying",https://genius.com/Lil-wayne-i-feel-like-dying-lyrics
You Song,Dedication 5,2013.0,"Shout to Chi-Town!
Dedication 5!
Since '05!
Know that!

You feel like Kool-Aid in a wine glass with your fine ass
You fine as two grapes gettin' stomped out by a giant cask
You the best dressed with your breasts showing
Like a salad, no dressing
, 
take you to your favorite restaurant
Ask for the bread, then fuck in the restroom
They don't ask for a pass when your ass waltz in my dress room
You the best bride and I'm the best groom
Wedding presents got my best man at the Best Buy
Buyin' the Best of 
Fresh Prince
 for the bedroom
And I'ma buy a summer house, with a rec room
And a car with no backseat and some leg room
And some strawberries and some chocolate
And a fridge and some broccoli
'Cause I know you like vegetables even though I don't
I won't say I won't eat it if you chef it
Fuck it, I'll hire Geoffrey to get a beverage if you should ever get parched
You feel like Ruby Dee to me, great and powerful Ossie
Who's behind the man behind the curtain?
 
Foxy, coffee
Brown as the bosom I flew in on
Nose round like the wheels that my rims spin on
Lips full like the light on the dash was flickin', oh wait, it wasn't
Oh, and I forgot, I'll take a microwave or oven
So we could kick the butler out and we can make a muffin
Maybe bake a dozen
My homeboy like your sister, maybe they can bake some cousins
Ooh, isn't that sweet?
You feel like Kool-Aid in a wine glass

This is not a love song, this is a you song
I just happen to love you
This is not a love song, this is a you song
I just happen to love you
This is not a love song, this is a you song
I just happen to love you
This is not a love song, this is a you song
I just happen to love you

Give you the world if it was for me
My diamond grill make it hard to see, I'm lying through my teeth
And now I'm flying on my PJ, looking at the clouds
Thinking about yo ass and how it look like a big smile
I get mental flashbacks of your ass crack, lemme get back on track
You say I act like I don't miss you, that's because I don't act
But anyway, we can role-play or get straight to it
Sorry, my mind in the gutter—better yet, sewer
And when you say I love you, I stutter, ""I-I love you too""
It's Wayne's world, she say, ""What is this world coming to?""
And she know me and whoever together, she hope we comin' loose
She told me that if she ain't the one, she gon' throw up the deuce
I laughed at her, we took a bath together and splashed each other
Then she got serious and said, ""Tune I gotta ask you something
Do you really love me?"" 
I tried to change the subject
So I said some crazy shit to her like
""What if you and I were just letters?
That'd be unfortunate, we'd have to rob a fortune teller
But I swear, I think I love you, fingers crossed in my pocket
Okay, that's a dead subject, you bring it up, that's a zombie
You remind me of... my memory ain't what it used to be""
She said she ain't trippin', I know, because I move my feet
And when she figure out that she been swindled
I'll be cleaning that love bird shit off of my window
I-I love you too...

This is not a love song, this is a you song
I just happen to love you
This is not a love song, this is a you song
I just happen to love you
This is not a love song, this is a you song
I just happen to love you
This is not a love song, this is a you song
I just happen to love you

I mean how many times
How many times I gotta
How many times I gotta say it for it to count?
Are you counting?
I loved the pictures
I needed that, I swear I did
I was just thinking about you when you sent them too
You don't believe me? I know
D5, what up 5?
I-I love you too...I do",https://genius.com/Lil-wayne-you-song-lyrics

I'm a douchebag to these pussy ass niggas
Hammer in my drawers but I nail your bitch
Blunts like fingers, I'm 'bout to make a fist
Everybody die, gon' bury me alive
Grab life by the horns, put the bullshit aside
Glock clip full like the moon in the sky
I'm at the gas station adding fuel to the fire
Life ain't shit but bitches and money
I pass that weed, like I studied
Bury me in fire and watch me phoenix
Highway to Heaven, I'm taking the scenic
You tied to the track of my train of thoughts
And controlling my thoughts is like taming sharks
And these hoes wanna kick it with me, I'm a sensei
And I got fat pockets, you niggas in shape
Tools on deck, tattoos on necks
Life is a bitch, I'll make her your ex
Better turn to God 'fore I turn to Godzilla
How the fuck you gon' talk shit to diarrhea
Motherfucker it's on, I'm just rubbing 'em wrong
Put a bug in my ear, but not in my phone
I'll have a broke motherfucker run in your home
For a crumb and a bone

Eyes hella red like chlorine in 'em
I was gettin' that pussy, I was gettin' that money
Long hair, don't care, Hacksaw Jim Duggan
Too high to take a breath, too high to take a step
Two rights don't make a wrong, three rights make a left
The cops on my dick, the feds on my nerves
I walk it like I talk it, got legs on my words
If she don't suck dick I don't give her that dick
Got the world in my hands, I'mma dribble that bitch
Money is the issue, full court pressure
I like my blunt Nutty Professor
I'm a straight rider with a getaway driver
Hit you dead on the money, now you dead on arrival
I don't fuck with these niggas, too old for new friends
But never too rich for new money
These niggas buying Haterade by the twelve pack
Like two stomachs
I'm laced up like two shoes, Miss Goody
Keep that ratchet, nigga
Trigger finger itchin', I'll scratch it, nigga
Blow your fuckin' brains out in traffic, nigga
Got green, New Orleans, St. Patrick, nigga

Living in a house of mirrors

Nightmares of the Bottom,Tha Carter IV,2011.0,"Sleeping at the top, nightmares of the bottom
Everybody wanna be fly until you swat ‘em
But who am I to talk? I ain’t shittin' roses
We in the same picture but we all got different poses
Now I’m looking in my rear view, I see the world in it
I try to slow down, and I get rear-ended
Pause, like a red light, I’m dead right
Highway to Heaven, God, do you see my headlights?
They say you don’t know what you’re doing 'til you stop doing it
Well, call me clueless 'cause I do this
Attention all shooters: I’m a shooting star
Life is a course, and I'ma shoot for par
Searching for today, instead I found tomorrow
And I put that shit right back, man, I’ll see what I find tomorrow
Young Money, CMR, Blood like a scar
Weezy F. Baby and the ""F"" ain't for ""Flaw""

Uh, uh
Yep, yep
Yep, yep

It's like I have it all, but I don't have to worry
Married to the money, a true love story
Only God can judge me, I don't need a jury
Nothing standing in my way like nothing's my security
Back to my journey, that bullshit don't concern me
If I knew I was going to jail, I would have fucked my attorney
If you sleeping on me, nigga, then I hope you toss and turnin'
I'm so cold I'm hypothermic, ask your bitch, she will confirm it, yeah
Now what we doin' with it?
Keep opening your grill, I'm barbecuin' with it
I know my shit already tight so I ain't screwin' with it
Some say this game is a joke, well I hope they get it
Okay, I'm walking on needles, sticking to the point
Yeah, the streets is talking, I'm familiar with the voice
I'm a gangsta by choice, I hope my sons choose wiser
And don't call me ""Sir,"" call me ""Survivor""

Uh, yeah
Uh, haha
And they go ""yep, yep""
Yep, yep

Uh, call me ""Killer"" 'cause I make a killin'
I got this shit wrapped up, bow and a ribbon
That's them twin Glocks, you can call them siblings
And them bullets travel, better hope I keep dribblin'
I touch the sky, get the clouds out my fingernails
These bitches think they fly like Tinkerbell
But they all on my wire like Stringer Bell
I let them be, 'cause you know how the sting’ll feel
Know how to whip that white girl, I can spank her tail
And I fuck up any track: train derail
Know how to roll, never need training wheels
And when the truth hurts, I pop pain pills
Uh, all or nothing or nothing else
I bleed reality, I should cut myself
Just had a bowl of riches, and a cup of wealth
And the ""F"" is for ""Fuck yourself""

Uhh, yeah
And I ain’t doing nothing but getting my share, breathin' this air
And Mack moms told me she gon' keep me in her prayers
So I’m feeling alright, I’m tryna stay aware
And if you wanna trip, then I'ma meet you there
To my niggas in the game, keep the game fair
Players play, coaches coach, and cheerleaders cheer
I’m trying to keep spirit when the ghost disappear

She ride me like a drive by, I'm real these niggas Sci-Fi

She said she tryna be different but she just like the rest of these bitches
But that's neither here nor there, and my dick is her chair
It be sexual warfare, I be loaded like software
Got so many hoes I'm hoeing

I ain't tripping, but she be tripping
They ain't got shit on me, but she keep sniffing
Look, girl, just gimme that brain, and I'll return the favor
Them hoes say I'm a dog, but how come I don't chase 'em?
I lick her with no chaser, I pick her out a line up
I just wanted some time, she say, ""Okay I'm your honor""

'Cause I can't do it by myself, I need a ass-sistant
I got that good-good, that get right
That early morning, that midnight
I beat it up like a fist fight, one, two, three, four, five, 6-9
That dick all in your windpipe, some of her friends I dislike
Some of your friends, they alright, sometimes I think y'all all dykes
But fuck all that, I'm on one, don't wanna be with the wrong one
That cold head, that warm tongue, my third leg run marathons
I feel you like I'm blind, girl, can't you see? It's meant to be
So come to me, then come for me, my game cold, one degree
I'm rolling with two bad bitches 'cause misery loves company
One sweet, one sour, my honeybee and my bumblebee
I miss you in the worst way, ride that dick no speed bumps
No red lights, no stop signs, just get to Lil Tunechi

Girl, you know it need some help, it'd make a nigga's day
If you said you on your way, eh, eh
Should I call somebody else?
Cuz girl it's almost twelve, and this dick won't suck itself
Girl you know it need some help, it make a nigga's day
I just hope you know the way

Open Letter,Tha Carter V,2018.0,"Ah-em

Sometimes I feel like I ain't shit
Sometimes a nigga feel like shit
Talkin’ 'bout some real life shit
Goodbye letter, ""Dear Life"" shit
So if a nigga kill me, hope he mean it
I just hope I die for a reason
They probably won't miss me ’til they need me
Have problems with admittin' that they need me, Lord
I'm talkin' 'bout some real life shit
Goodbye letter, ""Dear Life"" shit
Way too concerned to be conceited
I live and I learn, then die tryna teach 'em, Lord
Die tryna reach 'em
They care more about how much I leave than
Where I leave it
I hope I leave more of an impression on my kids
To be destined to have blessings to believe in, Lord
Just got off the phone with my son
Told him, ""You're a son of a gun""
Just got off the phone with my daughter
Told her, ""I won’t hesitate to fuck a young nigga up"", Lord
A few bitches left me, that only got a new bitch elected
My old bitch was too disrespectful
And only get my new bitch respected
That’s power, yes, it's now or next
Can’t lie though, I tried though
I'll die tryin', that's a common death
We was such a team, we was chasin’ our dreams
Then it stopped, now I'm outta breath
Now they try to tell me I need rest
And I'll find love again, I ain't find it yet
Oh, but I guess it is what it is as it appears, oh shit
The object in the mirror is more near than it appears, oh shit
And sometimes I fear who in the mirror, that nigga weird
He done died so many times but still here, why am I here?

Dear Life
What is my meaning? My reason?

Naked bitches really love ones
Sometimes our loved ones don't love us
I'm fuckin' more than I'm makin' love
Sometimes I make my rubber wear a rubber
I just tell my lady, ""Nothing's easy""
Even though I make it look easy
But understand looks are deceiving
Lookin' like I'm lookin' for some grievance
'Cause I been through way too much, don't wanna think about it
Cranky 'bout it, gotta drink about it
Gotta synchronize it, tranquilize it
Doctor ain't prescribin' what he ain't realizin'
Pain inside me got me thinkin' 'bout me
Tryna hang my body, sanctifyin'
I'm a gangsta dyin' 'cause all gangsters die
I can't deny it, you can't tame my lion
I'm a angry lion hangin' by a string, I can't describe it
Feel like a anchor tied to my finger
Got me sinkin' to the bottom of my drink
I know a lotta niggas think I got a lotta niggas
There's strength in numbers but it's honor over strength
I talked to God the other day, he say he got a nigga
So, I look death up in her eye and then I wink
It's way too real, the shit I'm talkin' way, way too real
I hope it gave you chills
The dirt under your feet could be the grave you fill
You don't know how dead you feel 'til you're dead for real
Gettin' high after I paid the bill, lower than a Navy SEAL
Show up with them Navy guns, I hope somebody prayin' for 'em
Price tags no mistakes, somebody payin' for 'em
Ice bath when my face numb, no expression
What's the life expectancy when you don't expect shit?
Mama told me, ""Fuck the world and be so aggressive
Be self-fluorescent, watch these hoes 'cause they so obsessive
Don't get too high to look over blessings
Never come in second, make the most of your seconds
They so precious""
'Cause if we could buy time, every store would sell it
If you want me to read your mind, need correct spelling
I keep it real, niggas better keep it copacetic
Where the weed? I feel like I'm gettin' a sober headache
Lookin' in the mirror at the one that know me better
I was too busy to talk, I wrote an open letter

Dear Life
What is my meaning? My reason?
That's the question I ask the reader, God bless the reader
Dear Life, what is my meaning? My reason?
That's the question

Shoot that motherfucker till I get arthritis
I'm a beast, I'm a ass, I'm ahead of my class
I'm a diamond in the rough like a baby in the trash

And if it's too nasty, spit it back at me

Bounce right back on them bitches, like Magic

Uh, fuck that nigga, ho-ass nigga
Leave that nigga with a toe tag, nigga
Barrel so long you can pole dance, nigga
Run up in ya house, where the dope at, nigga?
Murder she wrote on a notepad, nigga
Light that nigga up, smoke that nigga
Stomp that nigga, roast that nigga
I walk around with this shotgun
And this bitch bigger than me, nigga
Don't open up your fuckin' mouth
'Cause I'll pull the trigger like teeth, nigga
Shoot 'em up then leave, nigga, I smell Summer's Eve, nigga
We shoot first, it's better to give than receive, nigga

Hair trigger on the gun, I pull that motherfucker's hair
It's like, man, you can't trust nobody
I don't even have a trust fund
Don't buck, nigga, don't stunt, nigga
Don't duck, nigga, 'cause I duck hunt
Bitch, rock with me, that Glock with me
That chopper with me, obviously
I'mma empty this motherfucker
That's fifty shots, approximately
Now fuck with me, get fucked over
Emergency room, rushed over
Hollow tips, in the clip
My gun loaded, yours sober
I pull your card like a lawn mower
Fall back or I'm goin' forward
I see you got your gun drawn
I'll send you back to the drawin' board

You don't talk back, when I cock back
That's my gun walk, nigga, that's my gun walk
Yeah!

Walking 'round this motherfucker limpin'
'Cause the nose on the pistol 'bout as long as Scottie Pippen's
On the molly and I'm twisted, throw your body with the fishes
Double back around that corner and embodyin' the witness
Uh, real niggas don't talk much, do drive-by's and walk-up's
Lame rappers that talk tough get a broke jaw, star-struck
I don't fuck with lame niggas, I got good aim, nigga
Pop a pill, pop you, my nickname is Pain Killer
I'm still that same nigga; Eastside, I rep that
Pussy niggas better get right, or where I see you, you get left at
Use the rifle as my crutch, that's my gun walk
Or we can hold a conversation, let the guns talk

Green Ranger,Dedication 4,2012.0,"When this shit dropped I was like 16
Tryna get some head from a mixed thing, big dreams
Say goodbye to ripped jeans, nigga got a job
Had my little wad, worst fear was getting robbed
For my last 50 dollars that I had left over
Five dollars and they pop a nigga in his left shoulder
Minimum wage, $5.15
13′s on the whip, kept my shit clean, uh
Actually that was my mama shit
But I’m drivin' 'round town on my Obama shit
Middle-class my ass, just to get a tank of gas
Had to run the guns up the street and pawn the shit
But yeah, I’m headed for a scholarship
Little scrap game, but I got a lot of lip
That's why them niggas don’t like me and always wanna fight me
A dumb nigga hate a smart mouth, most likely, uh
I know the game, I’m an expert
Nigga, how you gonna jump me if my legs work?
Nigga I’m gone,
 showed up at the crib tryna bone
And I ain't fuck yet 'cause her mama always home
God damn, Lord have mercy
Please God, don’t let this little broad have herpes
My nigga say she fast like Jackie Joyner-Kersee
Gold medals if we gave hoes medals
No rose petals on a bed in the ghettos
Spiderman sheets, got her singing falsetto
Tall white tee’s, can’t believe we used to wear those
White folks looking at us like we’re weirdos
But we was only kiddos
Grabbing titties in the club, pocket full of skittle
Tryna get the kitty was like tryna solve a riddle
Tryna get to Diddy, 'cause I murder instrumentals
This that good old fashioned Mark Jackson
Fucked then I’ll pass,
 y’all Utah Jazz-in'
Ya borin’, 
I don’t play nigga, I’m Mark Madsen
That's why my knots thick like a fucking Kardashian
I’m not askin', my nigga I don’t need favors
I’m in the streets with the fiends, I done seen danger
My team major, we party like teenagers
I’m in the green Range, nigga I’m the Green Ranger
I fucking ran outta breath, heh
Team major, we party like teenagers
I’m in the green Range, nigga I’m the Green Ranger

Uh, bitch I’m not old news, I’m more like gold shoes
She eat my whole dick, she like Whole Foods
They say I’m old school, but I dropped out
Drop ya body off at a cops house
They throwin' up them bricks, you better box out
My niggas got enough white to build Barack house
I got my drawers on, Sam Rothstein
.44 on my waist, Rick Ross jeans
I’ve been faded, stone wash jeans
New pussy, new money, New Orleans
50 up in that uzi, G-G-G, G-Unit
I murk you with that bitch, scratch the serial number, re-use it, uh
I’m from the N-O, stretch niggas out like limo’s
Uzi go zit-zit-zit-zit-zit-zit-zit, that's pimples, uh
I’m bout to go banana puddin’, hehe

On God, 
Dedication 6
On God, yeah

25 million on a nice big ol' mansion
And, bitch, I still haven't invited your family
When you walk in you see the art and gold Grammys
I'ma just kill that pussy, now it's just a closed casket
25 million on a mansion, so precious
Bitch, be careful when you're bringin' your besties
Satin sheets, I ain't got time for no messes
That exorcist told me my wifey possessive
Adderall just so we can go restless
We fuckin' all, all night long, no breakfast
No confessions, no questions, we both professionals
Now ride me like an open road, no pedestrian

You bought a car for the bitch
I buy the narcs for the bitch
You buy apartments and shit
It's nice, I just walked in this bitch
You buy the art for the bitch
Y'all argue too often and shit
You always startin' some shit
That should come off of the bench
Shout out my homies I miss
Nino and Tony and Mitch
This ain't no cordial shit
She wan' come snort all this shit
She wan' go hard with a bitch
She know what happens today
She know we always forget
And she just posted the shit
And he just saw his lil bitch
Tell him I want him to trip
Tell him my guns gettin' skinny
Tell him they're starvin' for this
Give me the check, give me the throne
My hair is a minute too long
My bitch look like Vivica-Berry
Your bitch look like Rosetta Stone
I made my bitch go get a clone
Fuck 'em together and then on they own
When they catch feelings, I’m gone
I'm whippin' the Winnie the Coupe
I'm drivin' and sippin' the soup
The shit made me drift in the coupe
As long as I get to the stu'
Ruler clip, Rick the Ruler slick
Pull up on your bitch, you just called your bitch
Got that ""Who is this?"" She don't know you exist
She on her Mula shit, that's that truer shit
Make you eat your words, make you chew your shit
Then we knockin' out every tooth you pick
Nigga, fuck you, and fuck who you with
Yeah my bitch broke, but her booty fixed
Wait, I just popped a Perc, another for dessert
I washed it down with syrup
I just left planet Earth, ran into Captain Kirk
I pop a Perc, I'm trippy, call me Perc Nowitzki
Just call her Lewinsky;
 blurry, blurry vision
Blrrp
— ""Hello, who is this?"" I just hit the line
I got a bitch in mind, I call her anytime
She taller, but it's fine, together we 6-9
I hit her other line, he like, ""What other line?""
She like, ""Never mind,"" and she can tell a lie
And I can tell she's lyin', that's no lie
That's my awesome lil bitch
Got me a saucy lil bitch
Got me a bossy lil bitch
Left her for a bossier bitch
It cost me a arm and a dick
I got me a naughtier bitch
She suck on the balls and the stick
I'm about to play golf with the bitch
I'm way on Mars with the bitch
She fuckin' with Martians and shit
You shoppin' at Marshall's and shit
And yeah, your bitch gettin' trippy with me
Want a quickie with me
Say she wish that I had Nicki with me
Say she'd lick her with me
Wish you wish I had my nigga with me
Bitch, you washy-wishy, y'all can't trick me
She said ""God, forgive me""
I say ""Nah, I'm busy""

I got 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 bank accounts
Plus a main account, with insane amounts
That's somethin' to think about
Plus the drank in route, now I'm hangin' out
With 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 bitches ready to drink me down
Ready to drink me down, ready to drain me out
Plus my main in town, and she came around
Said they ain't her style

25 million on a nice big ol' mansion

Ride for My Niggas,Da Drought 3,2007.0,"Ahem
Weezy F
Young Money, Cash Money
This is Da Drought 3, ladies and gentlemen
And you know me
Let's go

You know I ride for my motherfucking niggas
Most likely I'mma die with my finger on the trigger
They tell me don't get high and I should try to make a living
I tell 'em I'm a hustler and I'd rather make a killing
My eyes get so wide as it rise in the skillet
I let my bitch bag it, if she steal it I'mma kill her
I bulletproof the ride, now I feel like armadillas
And fuck your hospital, Young Money, we the illest
And I ain't gotta lie when I tell you I'm the illest
My flow is nasty, like c-y-philis
Self-made G, and them bitches know the business
Relying on rap, but in the kitchen I'm a chemist
And when I was five my favorite movie was the Gremlins
Ain't got shit to do with this but I just thought that I should mention
You looking for divine and a little intervention
And them birds don't fly without my permission
I'm probably in the sky, flying with the fishes
Or maybe in the ocean, swimming with the pigeons
See my World is Different, like Dwayne Wayne
And if you want trouble, bitch, I want the same thang

And you know that I’m gon' ride with my motherfucking niggas
Most likely I'mma die with my finger on the trigger
Don’t worry about mine, I'mma grind 'til I get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
The sky is the limit, the sky is the limit
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
‘Cause the sky is the limit, the sky is the limit
And if you look high, you'll see that I’m gonna be in it
The sky is the limit

Buck-ten in the coupe, and your bitch love it
Switching lanes faster than she switch subjects
Tell a bitch, don't talk to me
And if you're talking to them niggas, don't talk for free
And I hate when a nigga say talk is cheap
'Cause I'm the type that let money talk for me
My flow is art, unique
My flow can part a sea
The only thing on a mind of a shark is ""Eat""
By any means, and you just sardines
I got the 40 cal. tucked in my P-R-Ps
What do you expect? I'm from New Orleans
The majority of my city is riders
They tried to make a brand new map without us
But the tourists come down and spend too many dollars
And no matter how you change it, it'll still be ours

And I'mma ride with my motherfucking niggas
Most likely I'mma die with my finger on the trigger
Don't worry about mine, I'mma grind 'til I get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
The sky is the limit, the sky is the limit
And I'mma tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
Because the sky is the limit, yeah the sky is the limit
And if you look up high, you'll see that I'm gon' be in it
'Cause the sky is the limit

And you don't want to fuck with a soldier
Use your head or I'll take it off your shoulder
Run up in your house and shoot everyone that's sitting
On the living room sofa
(That's fucked up, haha)
And you don't want to fuck with a soldier
Use your head or I'll take it off your shoulder
Mail it to your Moms with a dozen of roses
(Hah, now that's fucked up)
And I'm a G
And you ain't got to know the alphabets to see
I know my whole city is depending on me
And I forget a lot of shit but I cannot forget the street

So you know that I'mma ride with my motherfucking niggas
Most likely I'mma die with my finger on the trigger
Don't worry about mine, I'mma grind 'til I get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
The sky is the limit
Don't worry about mine, I'mma grind 'til I get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit

Because the sky is the limit, yeah the sky is the limit
And if you look high, you'll see that I'm gonna be in it
'Cause the sky is the limit
They tell me don't get high and I should try to make a living
I tell 'em I'm a hustler and I'd rather make a killing
'Cause the sky is the limit
Hands up in the air, because the sky is the limit
Can you see me up there? The sky is the limit
The sky is the limit
If you don't remember nothing, man, the sky is the limit",https://genius.com/Lil-wayne-ride-for-my-niggas-lyrics

Chopper knock your face off
Black shades, Ray Charles
I be killing them hoes
I got your ho up in my graveyard
I ain't working with a full deck
But I pull out that Ace card
She grab that dick with 2 hands
Like she about to pray for it
Clips hanging, no curfew
Fuck you and who birthed you
I'm shining like church shoes
Birdman Jr.: y'all birdfood
I'm bout it.. I said I'm about to cum
She opened her mouth: water fountain

Nina shut up, that bitch got a silence
Top of the gun there is a scope
I close one eye, I look like a pirate, fuck it!
TRUKFIT my bitch up, Tunechi leave big nuts
I'm getting my dick sucked
I blow weed like it's dust!
Spacehead: love pussy, hate feds
Just bought my girl a Ferrari Spider
Told her drive it like it got 8 legs
I'm a made nigga: Makaveli
That Mack-11: necessary
I'm a hard head: I pop the cherry
No pussy no rats, no Tom and Jerry
They say your friends are your enemies?
Well, my friends are imaginary
I'm the motherfuckin resolution like the 1st of January
My ride cold and my bitch hot
I'm tired as hell but my dick not
I don't gas no bitch, no pit-stop
Smoke Barney and Baby Bop!
Y'all niggas act like lady cops
My niggas smoke like coffee shops
That's syrup gang, wafflehouse
Gunfight, I'll knock you out
My bitch titties is poppin out
We poppin up and we get it poppin
Mask on, gloves on
Like Mickey Mouse, clips stickin out
Like Nicki's ass
Smoking on that sticky bag
Weezy F: I'm big and bad
Small feet, but I kick your ass
I'm the trigger man, and that shooting star
Eat that pussy like caviar
She treat that dick just like a straw
How you like them apples, Microsoft?
Now wipe it off..
I do Liv on Sundays: church!
Step off in that motherfucker fresher than some Certs
Uuh! Who the fuck is Stevie J?
I got the ball, playing keepaway
Kidnap your ass, kill your ass
Then hide your ass like an Easter Egg!
It's Hollygrove to my deathbed
Just make sure my pillow's fluffed
Hit a nigga with a million shots
What you call that? A million bucks
Good weed, we pass around
Money talks: mine got a nasty mouth

Til the motherfuckin day I'm Cashin Out!

Uhh

Hollygrove, Hollywood, Hollygrove, Hollywood
Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood

Find out where your parents stay
Tell my goons to go straight to your momma room
What's in your pockets? What's in your pocketbook?
We think the Bible's a comic book
Bitch this Hollygrove, too far from Hollywood
Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood
I got cocaine that's so good, need a name? Call it ""Milk""
Because milk does the body good
I got this heat on my waist
So somebody better monitor the thermometer
I just eat pussy and pussy-ass niggas all day
And I ain't even kinda full

Hollygrove, Hollywood, Hollygrove, Hollywood
Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood

Woo! I went from Bourbon to Beverly Hills
Show me your tits
I'll show you my weapon and grill and heaven is real
I get an actress into my bedroom
She lay down and say ""Let's make a film""
I be like ""Action,"" I hold her head down by her neck
This how breathtaking feel
Family first, you'll get your family killed, that's if you squeal
Pop-pop, close range, hold that gun
Like the photographer hold the camera still
Bad bitch riding my dick
She swerve 'cause another bitch grabbing the wheel
I ask 'em to chill, they both look at me, say ""Shut up""
I say ""My lips are sealed...""
Oooh! I come from Hollygrove, I done went Hollywood
I was a match made in Heaven
When Hell was a pile of wood
I run through Hell with gasoline drawers on
Stop, tell the Devil that God is good
Entrepreneur in a Bentley droptop Azure
Vagina connoisseur out the hood
I come from Hollygrove, every day Halloween
We shoot your block up and just say we shot a scene
This is a robbery, I let the chopper squeeze
Turn you to cottage cheese
Been on my beast since I was wearing Wallabees
Where paparazzi? I need my privacy
Fuck your photography, I react violently
Make sure your camera get my good side of me, Lord!
I come from Hollygrove
Hollywood should make a movie 'bout Hollygrove
Woo! Whoever play me
Should get a Oscar and a Golden Globe
This ain’t no movie, this is real shit
I don’t need a script 'cause I know my role
My Hollywood bitch just overdosed
All she could snort, more coke than Pinocchio
I come from the streets
But got ""superstar"" written all over my face
That’s why these hoes in my face
I come from Hollygrove
I moved to Hollywood just to Californicate
Bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop
I ain't finished shooting, tell 'em don’t check the gate

Hollygrove, Hollywood, Hollygrove, Hollywood
Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood
Hollygrove, Hollywood, Hollygrove, Hollywood
Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood
Fall asleep to the gunshots
Wake up and smell the embalming fluid
I come from Hollygrove, my bitch from Hollywood
When I fuck her she say “Hallelujah!”
Hollygrove too far from Hollywood
Ohh, but I done went Hollywood

Hollygrove, Hollywood, Hollygrove, Hollywood
Hollygrove ain't far from H-Town
We used to drive back and forth with the work praying
""Lord please don’t let this car break down""
Hahahaha
H-Town! Lord, I done went from Hollygrove to H-Town
Hollygrove to Houston
Got a bad 5th Ward bitch that be boostin'
Sometimes she doze off, that’s the lean, I excuse it
She said “If it ain’t ch-chopped and screwed, it ain’t music""
She say I never take her out, we went to eat at Houston's
Sometimes I doze off, that’s the lean, I'm just snoozin'
I still got Actavis, nigga, that's exclusive
Kill you for a pint, that’s a PT Cruiser
I see way too many hoes in my future
I'm gon' nail all them hoes, I'm Freddy Krueger
Grew up on Bun B, Pimp C was my tutor
Pimp Squad for life, had to do this for Houston
Hollygrove ain’t far from H-town
We used to drive back and forth with the work
Praying the car don’t break down
Ohhh, Hollygrove ain’t far from H-town
We used to drive back and forth
With, codeine, cocaine, the pills, and pounds
Yeah, and we got back home safe and sound
If you got pulled over you don’t give police no names
Or get killed and never found
Word, but I kept some money to bail out
Momma used to say if I ever get caught
They gon' put me under the jailhouse
Damn, I'm too Hollygrove to go Hollywood
One to the chest with this chopper
Leave you with just arms and a head like a octopus
I got this chopper protecting my livelihood
I'm so good, I'm so straight, I’m secure

Hollygrove, Hollywood, Hollygrove
Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood

I’ll bring it to your front door like you ordered me
Back in this bitch, but a lot more rich
On my Papa Bear shit, need hot porridge
Got a lot more shit than you can ever fathom
A big-head nigga couldn’t even imagine
The shit I do, most doers never done
I'mma fuck this beat, ya bitch, ooh, ya better cum
Bet I run this shit, I don't run from shit
I'll still beat your ass like a fucking drumstick
Weezy Fucking Baby, baby, make the ladies come quick
The money can’t fit in my pockets but I'll bet that gun fit
And I’m so unfit 'cause all I eat is rappers
And these rappers ain't shit, I like my fast food faster
Syrup got me slow like a turtle 'round this ho
And I'm flyer than the highest-flying bird around this ho
What's the word around this ho? You'll get served around this ho
Yeah, you'll get served like a fucking hors d'œuvre around this ho
I don’t splurge around no ho, no I don’t shine in front of no bitch
'Cause after she get off my dick I be like ""Find the front do' bitch""
I don't know why in the fuck your bitch keep coming by
I done fucked your bitch a hundred times
What the fuck your bitch got on her mind? My fucking dick
I call her dickhead, 
spicy like a Big Red
Strike you like a Bic head, your flow sick? My shit dead

Mr. Officer, stop arresting your bitches
Stop lettin' the messy hoes mess with your business
Mickey Mouse cheese, hip-hop Walt Disney
Sheesh, gosh, Oshkosh B’gosh
Smokin' on that Bob Marley, listenin' to Pete Tosh
I-I-I do me, no, I do three at a T-I-M-E
Why when we say we Young Mula
The bitches leave y'all and relay run to us
And payday comes sooner than later 'round here
And you see my sharks like they got some bait around here
Hey, you better stop the hate around there
Before Tommy, Mac, and Nina debate around there
Yeah, you see it in my face, I don’t care
Whole court hearing, trial, and the case around there
I'm the best thing yet
, I know I got that thing wet
Everybody wanna be fly but don’t know where their wings at
Huh, had to pause for a minute
Now I'm right back in it, like the drawers of the women
On a scale of one to ten-n my girl be a twenty
My girls so bad make a nigga think he's sinnin'
My goons so gritty, my goons is so with me
Haters gotta go on iTunes to go get me
Gators, matadors, baboons, and those grizzlies
All come out me when I'm on the micropho-N-E
Mic check, two, three; I am different like blue pee
And my girls be half naked like Betty Boop be
Like a hoopty, man, the boy been ridin'
And I ain't gassed up, 'cause I'm more like a hybrid
You think I'm stuntin', but no, I'm just survivin'
And I’ve been here, but my soul is just arrivin'
Look up in the air, it's a crow, it's a robin
No Ceilings, full dose, I'm prescribin'
Medication free, and for meditation we
Smoke some better tastin' weed that you’ll ever taste or see
S-H-A-R-P, as a tack, hotter than
Riding through the desert on a camel back, I done been
Riding through wherever with the hammer strapped, I ain't lying
I can do whatever if I'm planning that
So I got my guns, let's dance, like FannyPack
And we cook the hard, cut the soft and bring the whammies back
Mafio, bitch, where your motherfucking family at?
Call my nigga Gudda if you trying to get your mammy back
All up in another nigga's woman, I be ramming that
Seeing through these see-through niggas like they're laminate
Hip-hop so contaminate, I swear, just examine it
And I'm such a philanthropist, the God to these Evangelists
I dress so Los Angeles, but I love Miami though
I act so New Orleans, yes, I go Pistachios
That means I go nuts on any beat they throw at me

Cocaine on her navel, lick it so my tongue can go HAM
Put my face up in her pussy and my thumb in her ass
Make her do the jumpman, ayy
I put her face down in the pillow, 'bout to smother her ass
A fly yellow bone to me, I told her to come get a tan
Now she butter pecan
Oh, I got a Draco in the sofa, an Eggo in the toaster
A cradle in the chocha, the yayo doing yoga
And I wake up, smell the Folgers, I don't know how I woke up
'Cause I was in a coma, but now I'm in the moment
Wearing high socks on the front porch
Two cups with the mud flowin'
The plug ain't charge me nothin' for it
I cried tears of fuckin' joy
LVs on my luggage, boy
Don't ask me where I'm fuckin' goin'
I pull up with my skaters
Make 'em beat you with their fuckin' boards
Sharp shooters like pool sharks
Shoot you down in the Walmart
Shoot you down in the parkin' lot
Shoot you down in the food court
Hit your crib in the Steamboat
Then disappear on the speedboat
Act a jackass like Steve-O
Then disappear like Neo
Leave a red flag on your screen door
Leave a red flag around your queen's throat
Leave a blood stain on your mink floor
Like a red stain on clean snow
That money gang, 500 gang on that money train
And we walkin' around with bloody fangs
Playin' hunger games; mmm-yummy, man
And we storm the block, lightning and thunder came
When my youngest came, that's your mother's name
Hit the address, knockin' down picture frames and other things
Throwin' up Eastside like stomach pains
Sugarcane get took to Spain, a kilo fell and it shook the plane
A nigga screamed, the hoes wouldn't complain
I brought the AK with the knife, so the butcher came
And the Nina came, and her sister came
And what's her name, it’ll go Buka Bang
You don't even know where to put the blame, that's cold

Nigga tell me somethin I don't know
Like where the fuck did my heart go?
And show me somethin I haven’t seen
And give me what helped Martin sleep
On the same night he had a dream
And take me to where I’ve never been
But not to where I never be in
I ain’t never scared, but I’m scared of me
Me vs. Me, I need a referee
Need weaponry, especially if the treasury in jeopardy
Fuck deputy, big letter B
Need equity, need credit cleaned
To trafficking from peddling like everything
From amphetamines to medicine

I’m music to these bitches ears
I hit that ass like the wrong note
My bitch bad, with corn rows
With boots on in farm clothes
You can find me prancin in the finest mansion
With the finest dancer with a height advantage
She want cocaine, pills, and weed, liquor and dick

Life is a rollercoaster, but still unfair
A blessing in disguise is right before our eyes
But since it is in disguise, we don't know that it's there

And I, see you with your palms in your pants
But me, me, see me, I got the world in my hands
I make it spin on my finger, I'm a critical thinker
I'm a hell of a smoker, and a bit of a drinker
I know your name...

Ah...
O—OK

I got this chrome on this Bugatti, I'm strong in this Bugatti
Two V8s, ain't no such thing as driving calm in this Bugatti
Bitch, I’m bad, I'm worse, I'll pass the purp
Don't fuck with me 'cause right now, I'm higher than Captain Kirk
I swear, I be the sickest nigga, you can ask the nurse
And if you throw it in a bag I bet I'll snatch her purse
OK, I spaz, I curse; you last, I'm first
I'm on your ass, like dirt; behind that cash, get murked
I'm talking big shit, nigga, join my hit list, nigga
What's the matter? Check your bladder, I'm the shit, piss, nigga
Shoot the witness, nigga
Hold court in the streets and convict this nigga
Ol' dickless nigga
Man, I'm running with the blocka, Young Money, motherfucker
You think we gon' do our thing? Well, ain't it sunny in the summer?
And we coming for the commas, and whoever among us
And you know I'ma bust my ass until my crew very humongous
I said, T.I., hold your head, and Mack, hold your head
Wish I could but I can't say some other names 'cause of the Feds
And to my Bloods, code red, man, you know how we play it
And if it costs to be the boss, oh well, I guess I gotta pay
I—I'm a New Orleans nigga, I don't take no shit
Take the brain off the whip; now, it don't make no sense
Stunt hard on these bitches, I ain't promised tomorrow
Now, women kicking it with me like Nomar Garciaparra
Fuq' roll them killer plants, the Little Shop of Horror
And we roll them bitches thick, make 'em look like Toccara
Man, I'm too much for these niggas and three much for these hoes
The world is in my hands, and I keep my hands closed
I love my baby mamas, they get my highest honor
Gotta take care of them kids, man, I know you heard Obama
And I live on an island, Atlantic in my backyard
I just tell my pilot to land it in my backyard
Quarterback, shotgun, you don’t get any sack yards
Bitch, I ball hard, breaking all the backboards
Pretty Boy Floyd, step up, I will crack yours
And even at the White House, we pull up at the back doors
Walk around like I'm 30 feet tall
Tiger Woods, all these hoes tryna birdie these balls
In the Porsche 911, like emergency calls
Man, I just be chilling, I'm cool like Lou Rawls
Young Money in the building, I'm putting up new walls
Nigga take your Mrs. Officer and set some new laws
My flow is like rubbing two logs
Young Mula, we the new shit, new drawers, ugh
Now, get off my dick, I ain't fucking with you
Watch me shoot to the bank, I'm a money pistol
Weezy beat the beat up like Sonny Liston
Redbone do me good, then her friend assist her
I mean, a bitch she never met, her best friend, or sister
I leave the pussy micro-soft like Windows Vista
Young Tunechi, pop that coochie for a goon, ho
Bullet in you boys' memory, now you act like you don't know
Eastside who I do it for, Eagle Street, right by the store
Katrina wiped the city out but couldn't fuck with Hollygrove
Lost some real niggas I knew from a long time ago
But Heaven or Hell, I'm hoping that they be where I'ma go
Take a nigga gal and make her come give me a private show
Still ""long hair, don't care"" like a Navajo
I'm the hardest shit, go in your ass and search
I smash this verse, and I swag and surf

Big Bad Wolf,Dedication 6: Reloaded,2018.0,"[Intro: DJ Drama & 
Lil Wayne
]
I'ma just leave this right here
The greatest mixtape series of all time
Uh-uh-uh-mmmm
Care to debate me?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, sick shit
I thought so

Keep that shit on Twitter, y'all ain't lit, y'all litter
Keep that shit in your shitter, or eat that shit, don't spit up, rrr!
Keep my bad bitch did up, keep my main bitch put up
Watchin' me do push-ups
She was playin' with herself and I looked up, damn
Your thot need to get her look up, ugh
You're plottin' on me, my foot up, ugh
Your squad ain't hard, that's cushion, ugh
That ain't sauce, that's pudding, ugh
Tunechi 'cross her bosom, damn
Shooting up the jurors, damn
Don't name my pistol, I named the trigger
""Benjamin Button,"" push him, bam!
Y'all just pussy, get buried together and let 'em play footsie
Y'all just wussy, I got some bullies
Gon' pull up in hoodies and come take a look-see
Better play hooky, I got some hookers hookin' up with politicans
And some athletes, and some college niggas
Send your missus on all kind of missions
I'm the sickest nigga skippin' doctors visits
But my pots is pissy, smokin' hockey sticky
Put a stockin' on my face and hit a lick and
When the shit get ugly, I go Pretty Ricky
I don't fuck with rats, neither Minnie, Mickey
I don't fuck with cops, that's the piggly-wiggly
Fuck my bitches' friends, and they friendly-friendly
While your bitch is giving me her twenty-twenty
Like she tired of Mickey-D's, Wendy's, Denny's
Like she tired of Macy's, J.C. Penney's
I got bitches gettin' tired of spendin', spend it
If we winning, win it
I know dreamchasers that ain't never dreamt it
So I had to tint it and I had to rim it
And I worked the lanes like Shaq and Penny
It's the Blood gang, it's the money gang
Red rags to riches, need happy endings
Then it's back to business, and we laugh at sentencing
Hungry lawyers make a snack out witnesses
Hungry artist or a starving artist
In the kitchen, restaurant, and cafeterias
Don't make a difference if you taste the difference
Better pay the difference to the racketeerers
Now, your good luck looking like you cracking mirrors
Now the artificial become sacrificial
That's a body count, where the mathematician?
Where the wettest clitoris and fattest nipples?
With an ass that jiggle with a grab or tickle
With a throat deep enough to land a missile
If your nigga miss you and he have opinions
Tell him two cents is only half a nickel
Now, we at his villa aiming at his pillows
Hair triggers, fingers finna act like bristles
And I catch a triple, flip, kick, jiujitsu
Throwing pool parties, she don't have a swimsuit
Neither of her friends do, I think that's official
Got my neighbor's eyes bigger than The Simpsons
And her man a simper, so I had to pimp her
And she had potential but he lacked credentials
So give me a sec, I'll go at your neck
And send you back lookin' like the Dracula bit you, rrr!
Yeah, cannibalism, going animalistic in a land of civilians
These niggas clones, copycats, and chameleons
Once they dead and gone, no paraphernalia
When she left her thong, that's paraphernalia
Sound familiar? My plug Sicilian
He the one who told me that sometimes
You gotta leave your la familia behind the millions
Rhyme or reason, I'm the reason
Got their eyes wide, but too blind to see it
With friends like those
It make me text all my enemies and tell 'em I don't need 'em
Hallelujah, power intruders
Bitch walking 'round my house like Hooters
Towel user, power user
Molly mixed with white girl, Molly/Susan
Niggas talking out their bowel movers
Turn their homies into flower choosers
Turn your kids into father choosers
Make your bitch a widow and your mom a cougar
I'm a silent shooter with a silent shooter
Clap at you, if you don't die, I'll boo you
Tell a doc that's tryna save your life
And running wires through you, he could die next to ya, rrr!
I'ma make the nurse ride me like a giant scooter
Let her partner shoot it
We put out the movie, win awards
She got a Golden Globe head and an Oscar booty
Niggas prostituting
These rappers ain't talkin' 'bout shit, not even 'bout pollution
Ain't got a house to live in, ain't got a pool to swim in
Change in their pockets, nor a couch to lose it
En route to Houston with the contribution
Full of Monster juices, Mazda too slow
Macho, Cujo, macho mucho
Big bad wolf, watch the moon glow, rrr!
I got a Greek freak, she call me Antetokounmpo
Just follow the coupe, ho, and I know that you know
I'm hotter than soup, she still swallow my soup bowl
I'm out of my loophole, you out of the loop though
Got all these niggas on silent and mute mode
The power to do so, 
my pockets is sumo
Getting the mula by the minuto
Mafia Nouveau, I am the uno
Real boss nigga, should model for Hugo
Fuck with me, I go Lollapaloo-zo
Pull up, trigger finger, holler, and pull-o
Pow-pow-pow,
 sound like a symphony
Or opera, two-door, hitting some new notes
And I am the maestro, and you just a typo
Private flight, don't fly in too low
I'm wiser than you know, a private school flow
I got me a new ho, and now it's a duo
One went to college and one went to JuCo
I had to ask 'em, ""What's four plus two, though?"" Rrr!

My ultimate basketball dream team
The starting five would most likely be umm
Of course I'ma have to start with 
Kobe Bryant

This gone take a minute, umm, 
Chris Paul
Uhh,

Something You Forgot,The Drought is Over 2: The Carter 3 Sessions,2007.0,"I've been lonely, I've been waiting for you
I'm pretending, and that's all I can do
That's all I can do mama
The love I'm sending
An't making it through to your heart
I hope you hear me

Pain! Since I've lost you, I'm lost too
Nigga feelin' like he at the bottom like a horseshoe
Sorry for the trouble that I put you and your heart through
God knows that I'd do anything for a part two, or to
Be prayin' for the day you come back to me
Sayin' that you forgive me, 
give me another chance
I'm needin' it like a kidney
, I don't wanna advance
Give me back her hands, give me back her touch
I don't ask for much, but I fucked up
I know I fucked up, I admit I fucked up
But everybody fuck up, now this other nigga lucked up
Tell him me and my clique don't give a fuck
'Cause, um, we from New Orleans, she was from Georgia
She was my down chick, I was her soldier
I was her gangsta, she was my shoulder
You were the pistol to my holster... BANG!

You've been hiding, never letting it show
Always trying, to keep it under control
I see you hidin' it, mama
You got it down, and you're well on your way to the top
Keep doin' your thing
But there is something that you forgot

You forgot about the house, you forgot about the ring
I remember everything, I just wanna hear you sing
I remember the love, right after the fights
You can't tell me you don't remember those nights
And if I would cry, then you would cry twice
To me, you are the brightest star under sunlight
See, take away my title, take away my stripes
You give me back my girl, and you give me back my life
Give me back my girl, and you give me back my life
See, this is just a nightmare, so I blink twice
Open up my eyes hopin' she be in my sight
I remember the time, I wish I could bring it back
What she mean to me is what I mean to rap

You've been hiding (
Y'know
)
Never letting it show
Always trying (
I see you hidin', it mama
)
To keep it under control (
But I know you know
)
You got it down (
I know you do
)
And you're well on your way to the top
But I wish you and yours nothin' but happiness, shawty

But I hope you haven't forgot about me—
Up in the living room, watchin' 
SportsCenter
You were cookin' dinner, I was such a sinner
But the Lord is a forgiver; you know, they say if you pray
Then you can get your blessings ordered and delivered
And your boyfriend is not like me
Ma, you even went and got a teardrop like me
I remember we would sit at home all day
You called me ""butter,"" I called you ""babe""
My momma asked about you, my partners did too
I know your daughter will be so amazing like you
And I know you probably wish you never met me
And I just wish you never forget me, 
and let me say:
Please don't worry 'bout the women I have been with
No engagement can amount to your friendship
And I hope that nigga know he got a queen
And all I can do is dream
, damn!

I've been lonely, I've been waiting for you
I'm pretending, and that's all I can do
The love I'm sending
Ain't making it through to your heart",https://genius.com/Lil-wayne-something-you-forgot-lyrics

I'm over here smoking that really good fire
Eyes so low I look blind
But the stove on my waist cook fine
I be with niggas that took lives
And niggas that'll take it outside
And niggas that'll take it to your crib
Take the baby out the crib and rape housewives

That pussy boneless, that's Chick-fil-a
I fuck with real riders and they tickets paid
For them dead presidents, we will start digging graves
I swear my momma trust my work
So I give these hoes that work
They say the best things in life are free
That's why it cost for you to get murked
And my pants sagging like fuck it - I'm still on my business
Spent my birthday in jail, I was making bad decisions
Saw my enemy at the light, shot him up before it turned green

She got a nigga but he ain't me bitch
I'm the original gangster, he the remix
Girl, do you use that same mouth to kiss yo momma?
I say, only God can judge me, fuck your honor
And her birthday suit is her pajamas
She say, I didn't know your dick was a recliner
I'll punch your man in his eye, give him a shiner
I'll blind him, him and whoever cosign him
I get Adam like Yolonda
Young Money Cash Money, Obama

If he twisted, I'll unwind him
And this pistol came with a silence

But I swear to God he heard it, yeah
And I swear to God I ain't nervous, nah

Two hoes in the bed, it's hard to wake up on the wrong side

Few bumps in the road, a little bump and grind I don't mind
Please know, for your fuckin' piggy bank you could get hog tied
Two Ninas on me, you fuck with me, them girls goin' wild
Guilty conscience pimpin', make my ho sit through the whole trial

'Bout to throw another pool party, nigga
I told a op that wherever this gun point is holes, lil nigga
Stayin' on my feet, no tappin' on my toes, like Moses, nigga
I told the cops that my car is too fast to pull over, nigga
Cool as fuck, keepin' my cool before my composure, nigga
That's poker, nigga
Playin' the cards I was dealt, and that shit almost broke a nigga
But I could be broker, nigga
But I’m watching Oprah, nigga
In my white house layin' on my sofa, keepin' it soulful, nigga

Tell 'em never question greatness
I just do it
I'm so high I feel weightless
All my shooters are courageous, and

Ain't a moment 'til I make it
It ain't a moment 'til I make it
Have my cake and eat it too, I want a bakery
And see lately
All I've been doin' is celebratin'
Don't even know what I'm celebratin'
I know why you ain't celebratin', cause you ain't sellin' nathin'
They got niggas catchin' cases, while we out here catchin' breaks
And I'm gon' shoot it if I wave it, shoot it if I wave it
(Shoot it if I wave it)
Do yourself a favor, save yourself cause I can't save yah

Know you see me in that Rolls Royce, glass house, that nigga, hands down
No givin' up, no layin' down,
 
all red, ant pile
My oldest son just turned five, I said ""Lil nigga, you a man now""
Ride around with that strap out cause my Rolls Royce, glass house
I just got a text that said ""Baby I just cashed out""
Whack weed get ashed out, 
put Persian rugs in the crack house
All y'all that lashed out, I'll come see what that's 'bout
But you don't need to call the fireman, to put a mothafuckin' match out
I can't remember my last drought,
 
all my niggas' smashmouth
Got pure coke, brand new birds, we get 'em as soon as they hatch, slime
And you know the driveway too big when you ain't gotta back out
Paper chase like cat mouse, my nigga it

Ain't a moment 'till I make it
It ain't a moment 'till I make it

Do yourself a favor, save yourself cause I can't save yah

Know you see me cause my roof all in my trunk
Know he dead when the horn honk
Niggas say they kings, they lyin', boy you talkin' to a card shark
I already made my mark, please don't think I just pop corks
Got these voices in my head screamin', can't believe they're not hoarse
Bitch I've been a beast since cartoon sheets
It's real on the field, I need new cleats, outgrew these
Catch you while you sleep, turn your sheets to maroon sheets
Them choppers turn your homeboys into amputees
And that's not a good look, 
momma was a chef
, but daddy cooked the work
Said ""I know it stank but it's good""
Look, we treat them triggers like repeat buttons
Leave it all out there, or leave nothin'
Like the world a crystal ball, I keep rubbin' it

Ain't a moment 'till I make it
It ain't a moment 'till I make it
Have my cake and eat it too, I want a bakery

Still drownin' in the fuckin' money, y'all niggas look like y'all swam out
In this bitch, gats out in this bitch

All I know is paper, I don't know these hoes
I like mouth in my lap and pussy on my nose
And I'm bringin' home the bacon, it's fryin' on the stove
You hoes can't drive me crazy, keep your eyes on the road
Got the money on my mind, and bodies on my nine
And I swear every day, I'm on my Ariana grind-de
I got that yay,
 
I got that la-di-da-di-da
And a kamikaze squad, and you chicken parmesan
Lord, I'm a free man like I come from Amistad
No, I come from Hollygrove, turnin' Os to octagons
I get money while I'm 'sleep, I dream that I'm in Heaven
I dream I saw Lil Beezy and smoked a 'gar with Wessy
All my niggas, rest in peace, and my enemy, rest pleasant
So when my niggas creep, they catch him when he least expect 'em
Mama told me ""If you run these streets, run these streets correctly""
Well, feet don't fail me now; I never knew my feet to test me
Lord knows I wear new clothes to the mall
Two hoes on my arm
Fur boots when it's warm
Church shoes to play ball
I'm spittin' this shit like bird food to a dog
Urkel to big Carl, y'all don't hear me
All I love is paper, I don't love these hoes
Boy, that vest won't save you, neither will heroes
Lord, they better hope you save him, better catch the holy ghost
Holy moly, hockey mask like Halloween like OVO
Lord, all I know is strippers, all they know is poles
All they sell is pussy 'cause they been sold they soul
Boy, you go zero to sixty, I go one-and-two-zeros
Pedal to the metal, I call it rose gold
Lord, all I know is paper, big fat money rolls
Look at how big my safe is, that bitch got double doors
I was runnin' outta patience 'til I heard ""All aboard""
They mad 'cause I be skatin' at home on marble floors
Lord knows I drive fast in my driveway
I pop tags and throw 'em down and make the ground shake
Goddamn, a pint of lean almost 5K
I be spendin' 25K every 5 days
I sent my girl on a spa day
'Cause Hood just came with them chickens
I don't want you in the house, bae
Plus we need the kitchen
Lord, trap house in abundance
We got trap houses in London, y'all don't hear me

(We got London on da Track)

Hol' up, had to switch the flow up
Had to pour up, roll some more up
Watch me go up, my doors go up
When I show up, why you show up?
Pick my bro up, pick a O up
Hit the store up, get a soda
Get us four cups, split a four up
Then we slow up, yeah, you know us
Then we toast cups and we post up
Don't approach us, we got toasters
That's my slime, like we ghostbust
And we both bust, give no fucks
Take no stuff and take your stuff
Then ho hunt for some chocha
I know a ho who'll rock the boat
But I row her, I'm Noah, Lord
I remember when I was no one, Lord
When I couldn't find jack in no one's cards
Ms. Cita, I remember goin' in your gun drawer
Puttin' it to my chest and missin' my heart by centimeters
Oh Lord, I remember dyin' on her room floor
And wakin' up in some police's arms, he died recent
So I hope Heaven made more room for him, and I hope he see me

So ride to it y'all, vibe to it y'all, damn

Goddamn, Mix done hit a nigga in his head with this one
I'ma paint the city red with this one
I'm ahead with this one, see you fucking with the boy
Who tote toys way before Christmas, no assistance, just
That persistence, with that commitment, if
I don't get it, somebody gon' die tonight
I know my vibe is tight, and I deserve the throne
And if the kid ain't right, then let me die on this song
See I be riding, just riding alone
With my daddy on my mind, like, ""You gotta be kidding""
How the hell you ain't here to see your prince do his thing?
Sometimes I wanna drop a tear but no emotions from a king
Shall be, so I be, who I be, that's me
That's Weezy F Baby, and please say the mothafuckin
So I be, who I be, that's me
That's Weezy F Baby, and please say the mothafuckin...

I'm taking these chances
My head to the sky, my feet on the ground
My fingers to the judge, if the money don't move
Then I won't budge, won't budge
No I won't budge, no, Lord

Money is the motivation, facing the avenue
Back touching the wall, got the weed, got the gun
Got to run when I hear the bird call: (Brrrr!) Damn
Hop in that thing and merk off, swerve off
You know me, they call me Birdman Junior (Ah-ahh)
Anybody's murderer if Birdman sponsor it
Phantom of the Opera, all black, guap tent, locked in
I can let them shots out, you can't get no shots in
Bulletproof, leave a nigga with a bullet-roof
Shoot ya in your mouth, Leroy, they call him bullet-tooth
I'm like, ""What it do, what it do""
There's a full court pressure, I'm just going for the two
If I'm open for the three, I'ma take it in a second
Even if there's one second, I'ma make it, it's nothing
I don't take it for granted, I don't take it for nothing
I take it for what it's worth, to the dirt, motherfucker, yeah!

Baby, you gotta know that I'm just out here
Doing what I gotta do for me and you

And I promise if you try me, he gon' have to rewind this track
And make me go back, that thing'll go rrrat!

Got Nina in my palm, and I'm masturbating
Black Peter Pan, fly 'til I die, what you saying?
Bathing Ape, Yves St., Evisu what I stay in
Got me feeling like Scarface, light the Cohiba

I want Tina and Nancy, I get Nancy and Tina
Never question myself, unless I ask, ""Am I dreamin'?""

I used to fuck and get tired, now I fuck her ten times
She used to make me dick rise, now she make me ribeyes
She used to make me six-nine, now she make her friend try
She used to make me love her, now she make me realize
It's money over bitches 'till the day I dizz-ie
Keep it on the East Side, 
keep it on the B-side
I feel like Ivan Drago, if he dies, he dies

Find out where he reside and find out where he hide
Run up in that bitch like, ""Hey,"" pop-pop-pop, peace sign
Percocet, promethazine, you can call me P-Rod
Taking shots at my team, you must be getting senile
You goin' at my slime then you're going at me, slime
Your blood all over the scene, it look like red cheap wine
I'm smoking on a key lime, you look like tea time
Look like honey to my beehive, I close your sweet eyes
Shoot ya in ya head, give ya ass three eyes
And you still ain't seen a fucking thing until you C5
I remember you, I was never into you
I tell my shooters, shoot you and whoever resemble you
And every member who had been a friend of you or kin to you
They in it too, and bitches too, they mention you, they dentures loose

I just ignore you niggas, I don't bro you niggas
With my bros will smoke you niggas, like we grow you niggas
Kill your ho too nigga, and your go-to niggas
I've been riding 'round the city with the safety off
Glock nine and it's pretty like a baby doll
You niggas bitches and it's pissing all the ladies off
My finger sitting on the trigger like a La-Z-Boy
If there was beef, I'm in the kitchen with the apron on
Put his words on the plate, that nigga ate 'em all
And I ain't wit' the talking, but damn now he talking
Nigga spilled the beans, damn, now it's coffee
Looking for your pussy ass like I got a warrant
I throw on the ski mask, that's a private party
Bullets jumping off your ass like they shock absorbant
Rock your bells, LL, nigga locked and loaded

Who rebounding? Who gives a shit?
Fuck that, I got 27 years of this
Hit or miss, I hit your Missus
You are local news, I’m 60 Minutes
I hit the target, I hit the witness
I work out in my office, guess I’m fit for business
Too many visions, completed missions
Still icing out crosses, keep it Christian
We consistent, the streets commend it
Weezy F. Baby, the 'F' is for 'Forensics'
From start to finish, Usain Wayne
OK, you're doing your thang, well things change
You Plain Jane, I’m diverse
I save the world second, and I get high first
I’m a mind freak, check my time sheet
Bitch, I bring the noise, where the lions sleep
Your flow never wet, like Grandma pussy
I’m always good, like Grandma cookies
Yeah, call me the spleen or the spine fixer
It's going down like the Catalina Wine Mixer
She going down like the hands on my time-ticker
I’m always strapped; Vietnam, nigga
We are fine, nigga, like Amber Rose
We ball, nigga, like Jalen Rose
Better tell them hoes, I got a million flows
Label me the hardest nigga in civilian clothes
It's Young Money, baby, and the building grows
As we look up, where did the ceilings go?

Marvin’s Room,Sorry 4 the Wait,2011.0,"Dana texted me and said she wanted to see me
Then sent a picture of her in the mirror
No clothes on, of course and she want that dope dick
Hello, world, I'm the dope dealer
I love it when she talk crazy
That dick make her walk crazy
That last time was awesome
All the lines, we crossed them
I ain't a killer but don't push me
I OJ Simpsoned that pussy
Yeah, that's the shit
Pussy taste so good, make you smack your lips
I don't know about you, but I'm a beast with mine
She said she waiting for the Carter 69
I told her ""Sorry 4 The Wait""
I value her time like an Audemars-Piguet
And we gonna stay current like the water in the lake
Yeah, we gon' fuck around like we fucking in a circle
Pardon the slur, that's the purple
It feels so real like it's virtual
Any kind of position, she's versatile
And she take it every way except personal
Yeah that's my bitch
Pussy wetter than a wishing well, I wish
I was in it right now instead of making this song
Hut one, hut two, I run it in the end zone
Don't trip when I say I can't see ya
And she say she working on her career
Smoke got our eyes looking like we from Korea
We floating 
but I'mma rock the boat like Aaliyah
RIP,
 shorty got me
Shorty knows I fucks with her, hardbody
Shorty fine by me, Spend some time by me
It's a jungle out there, come and climb my tree
I know what's on your mind, fine
We can do whatever that is
She tell me that it's mine, I said, ""Fine""
Shit, I was taught to live and let live
So live it up baby, giddy-up baby
It's your world, ain't trying to interrupt
But maybe we moving too fast
But fuck it, let's crash
One day we gonna have to leave our love in the past
But for now I feel lovely, I feel great
I slide in: safe
Yeah, yeah, all that good shit
No, I ain't a player, I just play it by the bullshit
And I know what I'm doing, she loves how I do it
She throw that ass back and she never over-do it
She call me ""baby"" and I call her ""bae""
Sorry for the wait, Carter 4 on the way!

Aye, it's Cash Money Records, man, a lawless gang

Un-fucking-believable! Lil Wayne's the president
Fuck 'em, fuck 'em, fuck 'em, even if they celibate
I know the game is crazy, it's more crazy than it's ever been
I'm married to that crazy bitch; call me Kevin Federline
It's obvious that he'll be Cash Money 'til the death of him
The ground shall break when they bury him—bury him?
I know one day they got to bury him
Better lock my casket tight, baby, so I don't let the Devil in
People, it's just me and my guitar
Yeah, bitch, I'm heavy metallin'
You can get the fuckin' Led Zeppelin
Niggas is bitches, bitches, I think they full of estrogen

And I stayed on my flo' at Cash Money, like a rug
Tied to the fuckin' Birdman like a lug
And dear Mr. Ronald Williams
To you I shall forever give thanks like a pilgrim
Cash Money million-heir to the throne
Goin' at their heads, like hair in a comb
Sittin' by the window, I just stare at the storm
Know I'll make it through it like hair in a comb
Young Money over bitches
, my niggas trust my senses
And I will take a dasher as the Lord is my witness
And you all have witnessed, but I am not finished
So keep your mouth closed and let your eyes listen

The only time I will depend is when I'm 70 years old
That's when I can't hold my shit within, so I shit on myself
‘Cause I'm so sick and tired of shittin' on everybody else
I try to tell you like I'm sayin' somethin'
I'm from the Dirty like the bottom of my pants cuff
And now nothin' gonna stop me, so just envy it
Hey, I'll accept a friendly quit, ha ha

We put your ass on Nightline

Pussy on my mind, on my breath and on my fingers (But hey)
Niggas try to bite my style, but my style a jalapeño (Hey)
I got skinny ass jeans, trucks on the pocket (But hey)
Money talks, nigga, I'm caught up in that gossip (But hey)
You know all my bitches badder, and all my swishas fatter (But hey)
I milk this shit like cattle, that's my word like Scrabble
And yo main girl is a ho, I go Wayne's World in her throat
She swallow so many nuts, you fuck around, find a squirrel in her throat
I go tapeworm in that ho, let my snake squirm in that ho
Nigga we take turns in that ho, these niggas so green they glow
I am the best thing since wet pussy, on my private jet with my chef cookin'
So big-headed, my neck crooked, my niggas foul when the ref's lookin'
My big bro is Mack Maine, so much weed I got grass stains
Deez nuts, that's baggage claim, I'm on them trees like Candy Canes
Lil Tunechi (Hey)

(But hey) Yeah, 2 Chainz (But hey)
I might book me for a show (But hey)
Charge my ass the low and pick up the whole dough (But hey)
That's hustlenomics, I was high in my class pictures (But hey)
I like math, all I did was add bitches (Hey)
Swagga galore, got your girl on all fours (But hey)
It's not doggystyle, I call it froggystyle (Hey)
You dog her out, I tell her, hop in (Hey)
2 Chainz, my first chain had a twin
Gas in my blunt, watching ESPN
And, if that pussy good I wanna see her again
Yeah, I'm from College Park and I got ya broad with me (With me)
Salt water pool, I can put a shark in it (Damn)
Everything authentic (Tru), plus I named my pistols
Last name ""Fuck,"" first name ""I Don't Give A"" (Bah)
Pockets look pregnant, they 'bout to deliver
So when I start pimpin', you know the procedure, yeah

You leave your home for days and days
Alright, uh (Hey)

All my niggas gangstas, all my bitches freaks (But he—)
I tickle her pussy, got that pussy tickle pink (Hey)
I'm the heart of the streets, and I just skipped a beat (But hey)
And if that pussy sweet, I want that candy, trick or treat (But hey)
I got diamonds in my teeth, so all my words are precious (But—)
I'm so fuckin' hot I sssssss, I'ma need some more S's
Man I'm on some other shit, I want another bitch
That want another bitch, and I don't cuddle bitch
I hit her with that shovel dick, I got in that pussy and dug a ditch
Some people gotta punch the clock, man I rather punch a brick
'Cause I'm that nigga, and I'm so cold I just shivered
These niggas think they hard, these niggas just nipples
I pop a nigga like a 'sicle, drop a nigga like a missle
Mo' money mo' issues, I size you up then fit you

Yeah
Yeah

I'm in the crib butt-naked, bitch
She say my dick could be the next Black president
Americans hate that I'm American
Medicine, I treat it like peppermints
Ugh, I'm in the ocean getting shark pussy
Shoot you in your fucking mouth and make you talk to me
Yeah, sometimes, I need someone to talk to
'Cause I am not a human being—part two!
Getting paid show money for walkthroughs
Letting all these hoes ride my dick: carpool
My bars passed the bar exam, no law school
Cash Money Army, veteran with my war wounds
Ugh, what your man doing?
I pop his motherfucking top like a canned good
And all my niggas that I roll with are hella armed
And last night, I took a transformer
And had a dream that my dick turned to Megatron
But my girl was sleeping with Decepticons
Money talks, man, and mine talk lecture-long
P-U-S-S-Y: my second home
I be grinding on them hoes like a half-pipe
She say, ""Tunechi, you the shit; you need your ass wiped""
I say, ""Before you gas me up, check the gas price""
Then I make her take this dick like advice, hahaha
She seesaw it, she suck it and enjoy it
I stick it in her ass like some fucking steroids
Jose Canseco, make no mistake
Like a white boy wearing black paint, you're a fake-ass nigga
Brake pads, nigga, wait
You ain't in my weight class, nigga
Looking for the motherfucking man in the mirror
Running this shit like a faucet: Farrah
Barra-cuda, who the fuck you-uh?
I can make your bitch root for me like I grew her
Bodies in the sewer, tampons in manure
90 billion bitches on my stick like a skewer, that's swag
I'm a true Blood, bitch, no fangs
Been went pro, now I'm going pro-pane
Tell a bitch, ""Get off me!"" Bitch, get off me!
I got her over here blowing me like coffee
Decaffeinated, hand me that paper like I graduated
And I get head while it's decapitated, haha
Think it's a game? Nigga, come play
I'm with my killer Bs, fuck bug spray
Yeah, Young Money so gangsta
I personally know strangers, 
it's so strange
But this girl named Dana like to go anal
Shoot him in his head—what's that? A no-brainer
Plain ol' nigga, but a break from the norm
I wear my heart on my sleeve, so don't be breaking my arm
I'd rather wring your fucking neck before I ring the alarm
I dream to meet a serial killer that'll bring me along with him
I gotta hit 'em like redbones with long hair
Fuck with me, your ass is grass—get a lawn chair
I was fucking before my dick started growing hair
Bitches sweating me like John Mayer or warm air
Man... Nuts and bananas
You know how the tables turn, where are your table manners?
If you fake, put a egg in your shoe and scramble
No rubber, I just fucked this piano, nigga!

Vizine,RGB 2,2018.0,"Why me? Oh why, oh why, oh why me?
Why do I look up and see my feet? Am I rising?
But why do my peak look like it's out of my reach?
Why can't I trust what I see? (MonstaBeatz)

My-my scene just a crime scene
Got the high beams and the sirens, yeah
My team, we divide teams
Talkin' dirty money? Check the hygienes
All the dirty money get dry cleaned
Talkin' dirty money, Sam Rothstein
Had my goons kidnap your offsprings
While I was working on my golf swing
Ooh, sweet dreams, sour nightmares
It's a cold world, I got an ice grill
No one man should have all that power
If he can't afford to pay the light bill
I got a forcefield over my heartbeat
The window seal with no door key
I'm poppin' pills to feel more me
Cut off the wings now I'm soaring
And I never feel like poor me
I'd rather feel like the old me
I was born with wheels and I roll deep
I could make the devil get cold feet
Don't light the clove unless it's four leaf
Get a pussy wetter than a coral reef
On my face, I tatted me a fleur-de-lis
Should I get it covered with a coca leaf?
I could tell you better than you showed me
I could show you better than you told me
I'm an OG up in OT
And it's no sleep 'til it's roast beef
I better not hear a Little Bo-Peep
Better go figure, better go deep
Pass no judgement, pass your weed
I'm the GOAT nigga, no goatee

Why me? Oh why, oh why, oh why me?

Why can't I trust what I see?

Mmm, sippin' on purple like it's herbal
Bad brown bitch, Lisa Turtle
On turbo, you don't wan' disturb him
Momma put too much sugar in my Gerber
Damn, I done dropped too many ashes on my turban
I done seen so many titties on Bourbon
Live a different kind of lifestyle
Different color diamonds, got a nigga lookin' like sherbert
Stepped to the plate, knocked it out the park
Eat a nigga face like a tiger shark
Dressed in all red like Olajuwon
My niggas hit your safe like the Holocaust
My niggas catch a case, feel like I got Moss'd
My nigga treat the K just like a loft
Got a lawyer and an agent but I'm the boss
And my heart always racin' but never lost
Hello? I was the illest nigga on child support
Now I'm lookin' at the riot report
Went and looking at the final score
Bedroom got revolvin' doors
Bitches in and out smilin' more
Than children smilin' at a carnival
Ain't got nothing in common but the common cold
Big Bs nigga, honor roll
Hold up, I think I found the flow
Started from the bottom bitch
Never been monogamous, never been monotonous
Never been anonymous, money is eunonymus
Always had accomplices, always had conglomerates
Always let the chopper clip stick out like a bottom lip
You runnin' out of time so you better know what time it is
You runnin' out of tears and you runnin' out of volunteers
Young Mula bitch, I die for the logo
Cocaine price low, call that a low blow
Tunechi like Pablo, kis in the rowboat
Tunechi in the yacht though, still don't showboat
Sippin' on the slowpoke, movin' like a tugboat
Smokin' like a steamboat, fuckin' on a love boat
Better read the ransom note before you read the love note
Don't know if it's sore throat, deep throat or cut throat

Why me? Oh why, oh why, oh why me?
Why do I look up and see my feet? Am I rising?
But why do my peak look like it's out of my reach?
Why can't I trust what I see?

Oh why am I so kamikaze
Why can't I stay in my seat? I'm so hyphy
Try me, why do I see these bloody bodies?
Why do I love what I see?
Why me? Oh why, oh why, oh why me?

And they can’t blindfold what my third eye see
Yeah, I was locked up, but like a bird I'm free
And the coupe transform, no Tyrese

I'll take your bitch and make her everybody bitch
Backed up by a bunch of G ass niggas
And I just bought your girlfriend some knee pads nigga
Eagle street where the real niggas hung
I'ma rep that shit 'til Kingdom come
Yeah Short brang the drank, I bring the blunts
Fucking with me its blood, brains or guts
Fuck y'all, for real, though
Sleep with the hammer under the pillow
Get into the room, bend her over like her elbows
Soon as I’m done peel off like velcro
Gone, baby I'm stoned
Smoking on the strong, got a huge ass bong
Swag off the hook, you can’t use that phone
Stopped at the light and put my roof back on
One time for the G’s
The niggas got it locked, the niggas with the keys
The niggas on the block, the niggas on they P’s and Q’s
Put your bitch ass on the evening news
Jumping in the game better read the rules

We act like we strangers

'Cause love don't live here
But I'm here, and she here
She tell me stay all night
She just want a refill
And then she want to start fights
'Bout ""What about how she feel?""
She tell me I'm a cheap thrill
I know she don't mean that
She think I feed her lies
But I don't get no feedback
As she watch me pack
""Baby where my keys at?""

Hold up, wait
Let me set my alarm
You say ""Don't sweat your alarm""
And now the pressure is on
So now there's sweat in my palm
But her reception ain't warm
So my deception performs
And then that silence is awkward
Like am I deaf or alone?
I got a jet in the morn'
And she upset and I'm calm
And when a woman is scorned
Is when your welcome is worn
And now her temperature's showin'
And I just weather her storm
And she expect me to stay

If sometimes you see that I'm mad
Don't you know no one alive can always be an angel?
When everything goes wrong you see some bad

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

Uh, what’s understood ain’t gotta be explained
But you don't understand me, so let me explain
Stood in the heat, the flame
The snow, please, slow down, hurricane
The wind blow, my dreads swang
He had hair like wool, like Wayne
Huh, dropping ashes in the Bible
I shake 'em out and they fall on the rifle
Scary, Hail Mary, no tale-fairy
All real, very extraordinary
Perry Mason facin' the barrel if he tattle
My God is my judge; no gown, no gavel
A hound, a rebel, down to battle
Now or never or whenever
And the F for ""Fucking fantastic"", fuck if you agree
I'm bright, but I don't give a fuck if you see me

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

What's understood ain't gotta be explained
So for those who understand, meet Dwayne

Now it's Young Money baby, keep the change
My momma say ""Fuck em!"", and we the same
So hello motherfucker, you got some sheets to change
And ain't it funny how people change like Easter Sunday
You know, church fit, then outfit
Bright pink and green chest look house-lit
Bright pinky rings, but that ain't about this
What you 'bout, bitch?
Excuse my French emotion and my passion
But I wear my heart on my sleeve like it's the new fashion
What are you askin'? If I don't have the answer
It's probably on the web, like I'm a damn tarantula
But I know you don't understand
'Cause you thought Lil Wayne was Weezy, but Weezy is Wayne

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

I was watchin' TV the other day, right? Got this white guy on there talking 'bout black guys. Talking about how young black guys are targeted. Targeted by who? America.
You see, one in every one hundred Americans are locked up. One in every nine Black Americans are locked up. And see, what the white guy was trying to stress was that the money that we spend on sending a motherfucker to jail, a young motherfucker to jail, would be less to send his or her young ass to college.
See, and another thing the white guy was stressing was that our jails are populated with drug dealers. You know, crack cocaine? Yeah, stuff like that. Meaning, due to the laws we have on crack cocaine and regular cocaine, the police are... only..., I don't want to say only right, but shit... Only logic, by riding around in the hood all day, and not in the suburbs, because crack cocaine is mostly found in the hood. And um, you know, the other thing is mostly found – You know where I'm going... But why bring a motherfucka to jail if it's not gonna stand up in court? Because this drug ain't that drug. You know; level three, level four drug, shit like that.
Mhm... I guess it's all a misunderstanding. And um, I sit back and think, well shit, us young motherfuckers, you know, that one in every nine: We probably only selling the crack cocaine just because we in the hood and it's not like your suburbs. We don't have the things that you have. Why? I really don't want to know the answer. But, I guess we just misunderstood huh? Yeah.
You know, we don't have room in the jail now for the real motherfuckers, the real criminals, you know: sex offenders, rapists, serial killers, shit like that. Oh, don't get scared, don't get scared, I know you saw one of them sex offender papers! Don't trip, he live right on the end of your block, mhm. Yeah, that nigga live right down the street from you. Sex offender, on the level 3 drug. Convicted, ex-con, yeah, check him out.
And what you got, you got daughters, son, what you got? Yeah, well you know what? (coughing) Don't stop the track, that's the good weed.
You know what, I have a fucking daughter. You understand me? And, why the fuck would you bring my neighbor to jail just because the reason why he live next door to me ain't the reason why I live next door to him. Meanin', he didn't rap his way to my fuckin' neighborhood. He sold crack cocaine to get to my neighborhood. You move him out, bring him to jail for life, and then you move in a sex offender, hahaha. Then give me a paper, haha. Is that a misunderstanding? 'Cause I don't understand it.
Another thing; let me take my glasses off, 'cause I want to see the reaction on the faces when I say this. Uhh, Mr. Al Sharpton: here's why I don't respect you, and nobody like you.
Mhm, see, you're the type that gets off on gettin' on other people, haha. That's not good, no homo, and rather un-human, I should say. I mean, given the fact that humanity, well, good humanity, rather, to me, is helping one another, no matter your color or race. But this guy, and people like him, they'd rather speculate before they informate, if that's a word, haha. You know, ""'spec before check,"" anyway. Meanin', I'd much rather you talk to me first and see if you can learn an opinion before you make one. Just my thought of good humanity, Mr. Sharpton, haha.
Hold on, I ain't finished wit' you man. Gotta pluck the ashes, mhmm, hold on, um...
Mr. Sharpton, and anyone like you, you don't know me. So, if you're not gonna try to, then what you say or think about me, or whatever I do, is totally Casper the Friendly Ghost to me. And, it doesn't make you a good person to criticize before you improvise. Doesn't necessarily make you a bad person neither, but the characteristics fall heavily into bad's way, haha!
But, since I am human, I am good and bad as well. But I try my hardest to stay good. And some of the things I do and say may be bad, or just, not too good. But I do try. So with that said, I don't fault you. I mean, you're only human. Good or bad. but I also don't respect you, and I don't care if that's good or bad, haha.
You see, you are no MLK, you are no Jesse Jackson. You are nobody, to me. You're just another Don King... with a perm. Just a little more political. And that just means you're a little un-human than us humans. And now, let me be human, by saying fuck Al Sharpton, and anyone like him.
Fuck if you understand me. I love being misunderstood. Haha, why? 'Cause I live in the suburbs, but I come from the hood. Bring the hook in!

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood",https://genius.com/Lil-wayne-dontgetit-lyrics
With You,I Am Not a Human Being,2010.0,"Shawty badder than a three-year-old
Keep playing and I'ma eat her like a pita roll
I'm just saying, with my love I could feed her soul
Two-day getaway and we don't need our clothes
We at the pool and she looking like a center fold
Two tattoos but she say she getting plenty mo
She got Indian in her family, Seminole
Me and shawty go together like chemicals
And she get mad when I call other women hoes
You send her rose, I pick some flowers and send her those
Tall glass of Merlot get her in the mode
Two tall glasses of Merlot get her out her robe
I whisper in her ear then lick round her lobe
And when she check her watch, it’s never time to go
And with her brain she should make the honor roll
And when I came she caught me like a common cold

Damn you the shit
And I'll rip my heart out and hand you the shit
And I don't really know how to handle this shit
But tonight its moonlight and candles and shit

With you baby
With you baby
With you baby
With you baby
With you and only you

I say damn I must be left
'Cause you the best I ever seen, right
Shawty put me on, you got me going like some green lights
See you with your girls, they probably telling you that he ain't right
Bet they be the same bitches at the wedding throwing rice
Let's get together over night
Shawty I'm a pro and you are looking like the prototype
Ms. Cita, I took your advice
Sometimes you got to blow it twice then shake it up and roll the dice
I'm cruising on the road of life but I need a passenger
Appetite for loving, ma I'm hungry like a scavenger
I be on that lavender
I be in the bath with her
Then I gotta go under that water like a mariner

Damn you the shit
And I'll rip my heart out and hand you the shit
And I don't really know how to handle this shit
But tonight its moonlight and candles and shit

With you baby
With you baby
With you baby
With you baby
With you and only you

Now she don't know about me but I'ma put her on it
And she ain't sure about me but can't go without me
We probably ain't supposed to be together
But I wonder if our love affair could last forever
And shawty I'm with you
Smoke a lot of weed but I could never forget you
Then I told her to her face
If everyone was like you, the world would be a better place

Damn you the shit
And I'll rip my heart out and hand you the shit
And I don't really know how to handle this shit
But tonight its moonlight and candles and shit

With you baby
With you baby
With you baby
With you baby
With you and only you

Damn you the shit
And I'll rip my heart out and hand you the shit
And I don't really know how to handle this shit
But tonight

My nights is a mess, my life is a mess
My life is a mess of happiness
Lust, sex, obsession, desire with no love
Fuck it, my bae is a mess
My side bitch a mess, my wifey a mess
I guess, my bae is obsessed
My side bitch possessed, my wifey careless
But you gon' have to excuse my mess

She gon' have to excuse my ex
I'ma have to excuse her pets
She gon' have to be juicy wet if she gon' ride on this Tune Express
I'ma have to excuse her text
She gon' have to exclude the rest
She gon' have to tell dudes to step
Nigga, to the left, nigga, to the left
Messy, messy on some Percocets
Smoking purple veggie, that's my herbal essence
With a curvy, sexy woman hurting extra 'cause I'm working extra
I just heard her lecture, but I swerved the questions
And reserved a section with a bunch of bitches that prefer the pleasure
It's quarter-to-seven
They just heard the shower water runnin' in the morning
Dirty Devil, I'm a mess

But I'm sorry babe, but I gotta let go
Now she feel like she on death row
She don't believe in ghosts 'til I get ghost
And I can hear her teardrops echo
Her teardrops turn into XO
Put yourself in my shoes but you got to tiptoe

I guess, my bae is obsessed
My side bitch possessed, my wifey careless
But you gon' have to excuse my mess

Yes, no pressure, it’s a jungle out here
Fell in love with a stripper, Lord, I know she got bills
But I'ma make it rain until she see a flood of ideas
Got me all up in my feelings without knowing what I feel
I'm a mess
And now she over talking about staying over
And she ask could she call her clan over?
I say that's the shit and now we asshole-ing
Now fast forward 'til the morning time
Broken glasses with a bunch of ashes, makeup, and lashes
Out of place mattress, shit happens 'cause my days is a mess

I'm sorry babe, but I gotta let go
Now she feel like she on death row
She don't believe in ghosts 'til I get ghost
And I can hear her teardrops echo
Her teardrops turn into Petrol
Put yourself in my shoes but you got to tiptoe

Niggas call me Hi-C because I'm high as you can see
Niggas say they paid they dues, well I'm checkin' your receipt
Might as well go stupid since this is a stupid beat
Grab the owl out the tree, and ask that bitch, who but me?
Got ya bitch bent over nigga, hands to her feet
Tell that pig and that cow I'll go ham if it's beef
Cause all my niggas well rounded
Don't fuck with none of these square niggas

Why you wear Victoria Secret
You don't even believe in peace
I'm fuckin' you with both my fingers

Baby I'm out your league, bitch
You know there's no more me's, bitch
You need to show more cleavage
V-neck polo tees, bitch
You need to patch your weave, bitch
You need to pack your things, bitch
You on some ""I had a dream"" shit
It's back to reality, bitch
She don't even roll the weed
All she do is roll her eyes
All she know is social media
We don't even socialize
I feel like North Korea
Even though we oceanside
All I say is ""Mama-mia""
She don't even know her moms
All she say is ""This your pussy""
She say that to most of the guys
She don't even know it's dry
I can't even open fire
She don't even close her eyes
She don't even close the blinds
She spit all over the D
I'm sticky like porcupines
She don't even compromise
I still make her cum three times
I still make her snort some lines
And make her look so surprised
I still her make her recognize
Make her exercise to a sexier size
Then I tell her how to tell better lies
Now her extra guys think she never lie
We got a better bond, we have a better time
She got a wetter pond
I cum ahead of time, and a second time
And in record time
I'm a New Orleans nigga, I make a second line
I'm a Megatron
I got her legs up like the Omega sign
And I know she rolling 'cause I checked her tires
Then I checked her eyes, she a little rough around the edges, fine
Like Checkers fries
And the X was mine
She requested five
So I gave her two and told her stretch the high
We had sex 'til nine, ate breakfast tired
Fell asleep eye to eye, thigh on thigh
Then she woke up high, like ""Oh my God"" and tried to rectify
But if you naked, why?
If you mesmerized be mesmerized
If you scared of love, I'm death-defyin'
Got to make your mind, I'ma make the guap
Got to take your time, I'ma take the shot
I'ma wake the block, I'ma break the lock
Then rape your thot, then shake the spot
I'ma shake your hand when I see you out
I'ma shake my head when you turn around
Cops shake they head when they see your house
We shot it up, but look like we burned it down
Hor-Horror scene, bitch
Everyday Halloween, bitch
Kidnap, hide and seek, bitch
I'm a legend like Socrates, bitch
I aim at your collard green, bitch
Bada-boom, bada-bing, bitch
I'm looking for a solid, clean bitch
I tell her ""Look, honestly, bitch""

You ain't gotta lie to me
But you might have to lie for me
You might have to trap for me
You know I got mouths to feed
You know they got bitches that'll die to be
The bitch that'd die for me
Stickin' to a nigga like Siamese
And you just on the side of me

And you don't even like Adidas
Why you wearin' Yeezy sneakers?
She ain't never had a threesome
I dont' even believe her speeches
She don't even believe in freedom
But all she giving me is freebies
You don't even believe in peace
I'm fuckin' her with both my fingers

No Type,Sorry 4 the Wait 2,2015.0,"'Cause I ain't got no type, no
But when I met codeine, there was love at first Sprite
Counting dirty money all night, where the wipes?
I like my Swisher Sweet fat as fuck with cellulite
Yeah, my bitch got a wife
Yeah, got me walking 'round feeling like Dolemite
And these niggas talking crazy, but they don't get out of line
They pockets saying vacant, and my shit say occupied

Yeah, bad bitch on my team, mmm
Bad bitch on my team, just like Katniss Everdeen
Got lipstick everywhere
I got her shaking on this dick-dick-dick-dick-dick-dick like a electric chair, lawd
I got liquor, I got cigarettes
And these pussy ass niggas just got PMS
I don't think you should see him, nor live off per diem
She just took off her clothes and said you ain't lyin'
She pretty like the bride of Frankenstein
She kill it like she married to the mob
I can't let one of these hoes lock me down mama
She said don't worry son I'll help you make bond
'Cause these hoes throwing pussy like hand grenades
Don't let it blow up in your face now
Had to buy my dick a barricade
And a mothafuckin' K9
Diamonds in my teeth, I'm eating carrot cake
So hard for me to put on a fake smile
I had to buy my dick a barricade
And a mothafuckin' K9
I got cocaine, I got cigarettes
I don't do neither, it's at my bitch request
She like bad boys, I'm her crook in the neck
Her suicide note say she love me to death
Ooh, for her Lewinsky is so critical
And I didn't mean to get political
I watch her, let her figure slither
But I don't look into her snake eyes

I ain't got no type, no
But when I met codeine, there was love at first Sprite
I been counting dirty money all night, where the wipes?
I like my Swisher Sweet fat as fuck with cellulite
My bitch got a wife, got me walking 'round feeling like Dolemite

They pockets saying vacant, and my shit say occupied

I been counting dirty money all night, where the wipes?
I like my Swisher Sweet, fat as fuck, with cellulite
My bitch got a wife, got me walking 'round feeling like Dolemite

Outro,Tha Carter IV,2011.0,"Yeah, when I step in the spot, motherfuckers say ""who that?""
Big Bun Beeda but you already knew that
Live from the state where they chop it and screw that
You hatin' on the trill OG, where they do that? (for real!)
Motherfuckers need to get off the dick, man
Fall the fuck back like a bike with no kickstand
Get out my mix, man, just gon' get you stuck
Deeper in the quicksand with no easy fix, man (damn)
No tricks, man, those is for kids
Kush in my cigar and hoes in the crib
Drank and the 20 ounce froze in the fridge
You fuckin' with P.A. so you know what it is
I'm sittin on the fours that clack
Comin' down candy in the golden 'Lac
We gettin' to the money like it's Goldman Sachs
Said we do it for the Pimp so no holding back, let's go!

Look who crept in, crept-crept in
Look-look who crept in, look-look who
L-l-l-look who crept in with automatic weapons
Reppin' QB 'til the death of him
That nigga that inspired lyrical tyrants
Like Kanye West and Em
Track record, goes back to the Essence
Smack adolescents who ask who the best is
I'm nasty like gas from a fat man's intestines
I pass it, you gaspin' for breath and you die fast
Gut 'em like a gastric bypass
But ya Nas advocates actors seem
To get typecast in the same role
Since 16 I ain't grow a day old yet my brain grow
Cocaine white Range Rov'
Tats on my body like an art exhibit
I did real good for a project nigga
Was once a Bacardi sipper
Now it's Chandon, fat blunts in the car with strippers
Guns in compartments hidden
I was real young, little youth, a novice nigga
Blessings, bowed down, respected
Chowed down, now my food's digested
Pow pow, with my shooters are Techs
That'll bust louder than the noise that I just spit
Let's get one thing straight
That my crown ain't for testing, testing
Chop heads off like King Henry the Eighth
Guillotine to your neck, bitch
I'm a king in this thing, don't be dumb
Been in this shit since '91
Niggas can't fuck with the style I use
Your fate is sealed, no Heidi Klum
Calm now, was a wildin' dude
Studied Taoism and made power moves
Watched Wild Planet, seen lions devour food
You can say that's how I move
A monster nigga, and I don't really like doing songs with niggas
But yo, my nigga Wayne
Let them niggas hate, 'cause like my nigga Drake say
""We ain't got time to respond to niggas""

I'm a villain, I'm a villain, all that happens in the street
Poverty and desperation made me everything I be
I'm a shotta when I pop up with them poppers, burn ya block up
Call the judges, call the coppers, we takin' over Gotham
Word to Poppa, Blood, Bl-Blood gang, five
It’s that Blood gang five but green is the bottom line
I run this town, I ain't gon' lie, they run they mouth, they ain't gon' fire
They actin' like they ain’t gon' die, until I let them 'llamas fly
Flatbush to Bed Do-or-Die, from Watts to Larry Hoover Chi
Poverty and heroine, it’s no place for a juvenile
Put greed in our heart, it’s the green that we want
Cash Money is the company, and Weezy the boss!

They say I’m underrated, but un-compete-with-able
Hm... Understandable, being that my rating levels are unreachable
Anything said other than that should be silenced, unspeakable!
And the thought of you being nicer than me, unfeasible!
They ask is what I do ever gonna stop, this shit will never end
That’s when you hear a car crash in the vocal booth
Got 'em sayin' ""There he goes again!""
See now, they nominated a nigga to come and flatten everything
Now let me dominate it, nigga run
And they be knowin' that I be blackin' on everything
And make it complicated like a nigga constipated with a gun
I gotta make it what they want and wake ‘em when I come
And shake 'em and bake 'em and take 'em to another place
Ain’t no fakin’, ain’t no kind of mistaking
How I be breakin' up everything
And be creating a s-s-s-situation when I'm done (Damn!)
You see I spit National Treasure, discography rich
And I done killed more cats than curiosity, snitch!
Most of you niggas sorry and owe apologies, quick
What the fuck you niggas still hangin' around here for, you apostrophe bitch?
Okay, now enough of that, see now I’m out the door
Tunechi, thanks for giving us a whole 'nother classic with ""Tha Carter IV""",https://genius.com/Lil-wayne-outro-lyrics
Dr. Carter,Tha Carter III,2008.0,"Where's my coffee?
Good morning, Dr. Carter (Hey sweetie)
Looks like it's gonna be a long day
Ahh, another one huh? What we got
Your first patient (Yeah)
Is suffering from a lack of concepts (Uh-huh)
Originality (Ugghh)
His flow is weak (Another one)
And he has no style (Ughhh)
What you got for him? (Tssss, okay)

Let me put my gloves on, and my scrubs on
Dr. Carter to the rescue
Excuse me if I'm late, but like a thief it takes
Time to be this great, uhh, so just wait
Your style is a disgrace, your rhymes are fifth place
And I'm just grace, one, uno, ace
And I'm trying make your heart beat like bass
Hmm-mm, but you're sweet like cake
And I come to fix wherever your shell break
Where is your originality? You are so fake
So picture me like a gallery, capture what I say
All I need is one mic, all I need is one take
Like, hey! Brighter than a sun ray
Got a pistol on a playground, watch the gun-play
Like, no kidding, no kids in the way
But the kids do watch, gotta watch what we say
Gotta work everyday, gotta not be cliché
Gotta stand out like Andre 3K
Gotta kick it, kick it like a sensei
You gotta have faith, you gottta, gotta
Wait, wait, I think I, I think I lost him
(Flatline)

Good afternoon, Dr. Carter (Nurse)
I don't know about this one. His confidence is down, vocab and metaphors needs work, and he lacks respect for the game
(Uhhhh, let me see)
You think you can save him?

Okay, respect is in the heart, so that's where I'mma start
And a lot of heart patients don't make it
But, hey kid, plural, I graduated
'Cause you can get through anything if Magic made it
And that was called recycling, r-e-reciting something
'Cause you just like it, so you say it just like it
Some say it's biting but I say it's enlightening
Besides, Dr. Kanye West is one of the brightest
And Dr. Swizz can stitch your track up the tightest
And Dr. Jeezy can fix you back up the nicest
Arthritis in my hand from writing
But I'm a doctor, they don't understand my writing
So I stopped writing, now I'm like lightning
And you ain't Vince Young so don't clash with the Titan
Fast and exciting, my passion is frightening
Now let me put some more vocab in your IV
Here, take this Vicodin, like it and love it
And confidence has no budget
So pay me no mind, I don't walk it like I talk it 'cause I run it
I don't do it 'cause I done it, and I'm in the emergency un-it
God dunnit I've lost another one
(Flatline)

Good evening, Dr. Carter. It's been a long day. But this one looks much better than the others. His respect is back up, concepts sound good, his style is showing strong signs of improvement. All he needs now is his swagger
Okay, let me take my gloves off then

Swagger tighter than a yeast infection
Fly, go hard, like geese, erection
Fashion patrol, police detection
Eyes stay tight like Chinese Connection
I stay tight like pussy at night
Baby, don't get me wrong, I could do that pussy right
But I'm too wrong to write, too fresh to fight
Too paid to freestyle, too paid to freestyle
Had to say it twice, swagger so nice
And don't ask me shit unless it concern a price
And I don't rap fast, I rap slow
'Cause I mean every letter in the words
In the sentence of my quotes
Swagger just flows sweeter than honey oats
That swagger, I got it, I wear it like a coat
Wait, as I put the light down his throat
I can only see flow, his blood starting to flow
His lungs starting to grow, this one's starting to show
Strong signs of life, where's the stitches? Here's the knife
Smack his face, his eyes open, I reply ""What a night""
""Welcome back, Hip-Hop — I saved your life""

He looks good, his vitals are up
He's looking good, he's looking good
I think we got one, Dr. Carter, I think we got one
Yep, yep, we got one, we saved him he's good
He's good, we got one, he's good
(Heartbeat)
He's good, we got him
We saved him, he's a go
He's good",https://genius.com/Lil-wayne-dr-carter-lyrics

That nigga right over there, that nigga's from another planet""
Cut the weed, pop-pop
Insanity shit, niggas from this planet can't see
U-u-u-u-uhh

Hot's what it is, watch what the kid drops
I'ma get the prop if you're not with the biz
Not only other regions, I really popped at the crib
So hatin' motherfuckers, you better stop with the jibs
Off of the thizz, but I'm boss
It don't matter what the cost
When I live right across from the Wiz
Killa City will have a nigga lost in the Mid
Leavin' nothin' but mothers stuck and plus a coffin to give
What is happening is a merger, different levels of murder
Lil Weezy cookin' and I'm a server
Further, that's what I'ma get doing this
Remember when eating Gerber
Mama said to kill 'em all and I heard her
Thank you Baby for what became Lil Wayne
He's gettin' all the people knowin' that Strange in the game
I been really able to hang in the fame
But when he shouted my name, it's been a change in my lane
I'm a Klusterfuk and lovin' nothin' but to get your brain
And I be stuck in lust and quick to a bust a nut
And take a nigga's dame with no shame
Really be bussin' up, they thinkin' they thuggin' tough
But never do knuckle up, you in the gang, you bang
You drug and touchin' every thang, you lame
Sucka, you cannot sustain the reign
Tech N9ne is such a cuckoo in this
Ballin' nigga, Strange Music, crew threw swishes
I know a lot of you prolly never knew who this is
Well, you listenin' to Tecca Nina, Soo Woo bidness

Today, I feel electric gray, I hope tomorrow neon black
I tell a nigga, ""All those flows are borrowed""
It’s the pharaoh, Three Stacks
I woke up in Cairo, lookin’ at stars
So bright in the sky, I thought they were marbles
No car doors, whatcha call those?
AA whole carload, of raw hoes
In a Jeep Defender
Please remember, don’t feed the Simba
Three’s assembled like nobody
He's a symbol of what's safari
Pulled her ponytail to my body
She’s the only girl that was smart e-nough
To call me 'Mr. Benjamin' in the middle of a wild party
Skin was cinnamon; I pound it harder
How come the only girls that are thought of
Are the light ones? Well tonight then
We gon’ do it, do it, do it for the dark ones
It’s important that you are more than

Change my name, I ain't like average Joe, nigga
Up above wit' my above average ho, nigga
Tight frame with a tight cameltoe, nigga
I got killers on the front line, you on the sideline
Follow the guidelines or you be in the skyline
Killas on the inside, and on your blindside
Shoot you right between your motherfuckin’ eyebrows
Ooh, kill 'em - It's that ""Carter V"", let me get 'em
I'm feeling like John Gotti Lennon
And you gon' respect my mind and my sign and my emblem
You got money on your mind and we aimin' at your temple
Check me out or just be quiet in the library, nigga
Or the flowers on your grave gon' be dyin’ every winter
And as long as I’m alive I'm a financial wizard
Long as I can make a dollar out a dime and a nickle
Thank the Lord I’m not a broke nigga

I get money, I'm a hustler
So if you buyin' what I'm sellin’, you a customer
See I can get it to you anywhere, anything
But it's point-blank range when the pistol bang
I mix it up, I fix it up and I switched it up
I locked down this end and got it twisted up
See I'm a dog, but I loc with my locs
They say, ""You are what you smoke""

I grew up around dope niggas
Uh, uh, uh, dope niggas
I grew up around dope niggas

Yeah, I grew up around dope niggas and cold killers
And most niggas was both, nigga, two sport niggas
I was no different from those niggas, but I was chose, nigga
See those niggas somewhere with me in these hoes, nigga
Momma was a go-getter, a coach, nigga
Taught me everything I know, nigga, a soul sister
Taught me how to be a goal tender, support system
For that bitch, you played her role with ya and those children
I ain't lyin', slime, all my niggas balling, it's a fuckin' team sport
I could change the world, but I done lost the remote
All my niggas balling, that's how it's supposed to be, ho
I could change the world, I'd rather change to beast mode
Coke sniffers and dope stickers
And most niggas was both, nigga, explode, nigga
Pop a motherfuckin' cork, nigga, to those niggas
'Cause life's too fuckin' short, nigga, get old, nigga
I ain't lyin', got a gold mirror just to see my goals clearer
Be a role player, role model, while you roll with 'em
They say you don't need to be with us, stay on the road, nigga
That way I wouldn't come to the end of the road with 'em
Man, all my niggas targets, that's includin' me, ho
I could change the world, I'd rather change the people
And definitions 'cause we're defined by our legal roles
All your haters fuelin', my needle broke
Lord, I ain't a broke nigga

I thank the Lord I ain't a broke nigga
I thank the Lord I ain't a broke nigga

I get money, I'm a hustler

Make me sick to my stomach, I feel nauseated
All you haters hold hands and jump off a building
I could still taste her pussy, memorabilia
Backpack full of artillery, one me, no equivalent
These niggas acting like lil bitches
I don’t understand this shit like you scribbled it
Took her clothes, step back and exhibit it
Then tear her ass up like a parking ticket
The end of the road is at walking distance
Have to get that blood off my hands, left the faucet drippin
In yo face like a airbag in a car collision
My weed man so consistent
I’m stayin rich, tryin not to make poor decisions
Everything I do I plan it out like a solar system
Nigga if you clumsy you gon slip and fall a victim to me
Your bitch is sendin' naked pictures to me
Then she shoot over to my house, I scoot over in a bed
I shoot off in her mouth then she bit the bullet uh
Skatin on em like I’m Lil Wayne
And the weed so strong I can feel veins
Write it down, take a picture, now I feel framed
The drugs got me so numb I can’t feel ashamed
And my girl at home with the mood swings
Girl I gotta make a few runs like Usain
Wish I had a penny for my thoughts for some loose change
Hungry niggas going at yo neck for that food chain
Pop some pills that make me sleepy
Hoes creep me in they Teepee
I hope that pussy taste like kiwi
Hope it’s nicer than Tahiti, hopin I could get a freebie
Leavin a nigga body floatin with a mouth full of seaweed
What's in my Louis backpack, that’s E.T
Snitches give me the heebeegeebees
I hope they’ll disappear, where the fuck is Houdini?
I got niggas on my side, you got niggas on yo back
I’mma yell timber, money grow on trees
Money over queens, fuck you blow me
I sit back enjoy the breeze, hoes prettier than please
I don’t really do shit but sit back and call the shots
She poured out her heart, I had it on the rocks
Red beam on yo head, that’s a cherry on top
You don’t wanna keep your cool, I know niggas that’ll die uh
I danced with the devil in my dreams
When I wake up I still hear the same song
Make me wanna blow a motherfucker brains out
Flood warning nigga, I’m about to brainstorm, lil nigga
I’ll take yo main ho, make her call her homegirl
Make em share the same dick
It’s that motherfuckin Dedication 5
I just hope I’ll be alive to see a Dedication 6
Lil Tunechi

Ayo it’s levels to this shit, levels to this shit
Been doing MIA since Levels was the shit
And niggas know I’m on another level with this shit
I’m pedaling the 6, full metal when it hit
All I need is a shovel and a ditch
You done dig me a hole then you show me where it is
Run in his home and show me where the kids
Put one in his dome while he going in his fridge
That’s me, him nigga
Black piece AP, gold trim nigga
Black jeans, grey tee, old Tim’s nigga
Backstreet, everything go for 10 nigga
Keep quiet, beef we deep fry it
I’m in the streets like Rodney King’s riots
Mommy opposed their lead tight
On that old bullshit, Pete Myers
They scream and seize fire
My audible like Godfather meets Wire
A felon in the whip
Rollin 3 6’s, devil on trips
Shots whistled like a kettle when it’s lit

I knock your head off – Fumble
Homeboys be cutthroat
That shit got me with a lump throat

Young Money was my best investment
Going harder than my predecessor

Niggas stab me in the back, I owe 'em

With mountain lions and coyotes
Semi, I keep that semi
And friendly, I can't be friendly
Freckles, them bullet holes look like freckles
You look like Wendy's
House in the hills jumpin' like Jordan
I can't swim but I'm throwing pool parties
I got a bitch over there, and a bitch over there
A young nigga starting to feel cornered
My LA house jumpin' like Jordan
My Miami house jumpin' like Jordan
Can't forget about my house in New Orleans
So sorry for the wait, I'm sorry
I want my new bitch titties enormous
With a backyard and a pretty garden
With a pussy more pink than a orchid
Young nigga gonna treat it like a florist
I got my side bitch feeling important
I got my main bitch feeling immortal
I got my ex bitch feeling insulted
Cause wifey get money like Kimora
I got a fine bitch feeling exhausted
Cause I'mma put this dick on her 'til tomorrow
I'mma pull up on a bitch in a Gallardo
Then I'mma take the top off like a barber
I go down and kiss her Pearl Harbor
She's so down with this New World Order
Fuck the shit out her in a sauna
Sweat her hair out, she look like Al Sharpton
Got a goon named Fernando
At the front door your condo
Knock-knock, who's there?
He don't care, he's psycho
Bad bitch with a nice throat
She ice cold and she like hoes
Ooh, she just my type
These other hoes just typos
Young nigga coming back like Jordan
So sorry for the wait, I'm sorry

Young nigga drank lean like water
Young nigga smoke weed like Marley
Young nigga on the Moon like Warren
Young nigga on this shit like Charmin

You could still smell the kitchen on me
Nigga I'll have your homies
Singing ""Damn I miss my homie""

I got mountains like Wyoming
I got a bad bitch and she foreign
She always mad with me, I'm sorry
She say ""Damn why you can’t call me?""
""Cause they be taxin' for that roaming""

You got fake juice
Even Slick Rick the ruler know I break rules, ooh
Got the gas out shootin' like Jordan
I'll put your homeboy face on a T-shirt
And put your own face on a milk carton
Busy, I’ve been so busy
Ain’t even got time for quickies
That’s why my bitch been so bitchy
I’m out here tryin' to get me
I’m coming back out jumpin' like Jordan
I’m so sorry for the wait, I’m tardy

So you've got so many diamonds
You wear all the finest clothes
And your grill is shining
As you're driving down the streets of gold
But you can't blame me
If I set this stage on fire
Ha!

Ha! Momma always told me I was crazy
And my hoes say I'm amazing, but I don't listen to a lady
But the bitch say I'm hot, and I say ""No bitch, I'm blazing""
Like, what the fuck you expect? I'm a motherfucking Cajun
I feel caged in my mind, it's like my flow doing time
I goes crazy inside, but when it comes out—it's fine
Like wine; wait, watch...
See? I get better with time like a watch
Osh B'Gosh, Posh Spice husband
Couldn't kick it like I kick it, bitch! I Kix it
No cereal, like a landing, I sticks it
Wherever she asks me, after she licks it
""That's too explicit""; well, why you listening?
*Sniff* I smell smoke, and something's sizzling
That's her pussy
So, hey, pussy: play with pussy or play pussy

But you can't blame me
If I set this stage on fire
Hahahaha!

They say, ""You're nobody 'til somebody kills you
Well, where I'm from, you're nobody 'til you kill somebody
And you know what they say: when you great
It's not ""murder,"" it's ""assassinate""

'Cause I'm doing the same shit Martin Luther King did
Checking in the same hotel, in the same suite, bitch
Same balcony, like, ""Assassinate me, bitch!""

I don't rap, I film movies
With my rap, you could call me
""Mr. Director's Chair,"" yeah, and that's a wrap
Cut! On to the next...
Not the next scene, bitch, the next check
Some say the X makes the sex 'spec-
So play with the pussy or play pussy

So you've got so many diamonds
Hey, pussy, lay pussy
You wear all the finest clothes
Do what I... say, pussy, and I say, I say

Lay pussy, lay pussy, lay, pussy, haha
As you're driving down the streets of gold

Hey pussy, don't play pussy
If I set this stage on fire!
Get 'em!

Straight off the corner of Apple and Eagle
Braveheart, bitch, like the times are medieval
Married to the game, divorced the cathedral
Standing on the corner selling porcelain to people
Forced into evil, it's all in your head
It's all so cerebral, call me Knievel
You follow and I lead you, straight to the needles
The bottles, the battles, the beetles'll eat you
Momma named Cita—I love you, Cita
'Member when your pussy second husband tried to beat ya?
'Member when I went into the kitchen, got the cleaver?
He ain't give a fuck, I ain't give a fuck neither
He could see the devil, see the devil in my features
He could smell the ether, you can see Cita
You can see the Cita, see the Cita in my features
And she don't play neither

The sky is falling
 and the only thing that can save us now
Is sensitivity and compassion
Da da da, da-da-da, da da da
Da da da, da-da-da, da da da, ooohh
But I know one thing's for sure
I'm gonna get my kicks before it all burns down

Yeah, some say tragedy's hard to get over
But sometimes that tragedy means it's over
Soldier, from the academy league of rollers
I deny being down though they seem to hold us
My shoulders are strong, I prove 'em wrong
I ain't doing nothing but moving on, let the truth be known
But they talked that freedom at us
And didn't even leave a ladder, damn

I work at the corner store
We all got problems, problems
No one's gonna fly down low
No one's gonna save us now
How you feel you're not alone
We're all just jealous, jealous
We don't reach the sky no more
We just can't overcome, no

You tie my hands, what am I gonna be?
What have I done so bad? What is my destiny?
You tie my hands, what am I suppose to see?
What have I done so bad? What am I gonna be?

I, knock on the door, hope isn't home
Fate's not around, the luck's all gone
Don't ask me what's wrong, ask me what's right
And I'mma tell you what's life, and did you know
I lost everything? But I ain't the only one
First came the hurricane, then the morning sun
Excuse me if I'm on one
And don't trip if I light one, I walk a tight one
They tryna tell me keep my eyes open
My whole city underwater, some people still floating
And they wonder why black people still voting
Cause your president still choking
Take away the football team, the basketball team
And all we got is me to represent New Orleans, shit
No governor, no help from the mayor
Just a steady beating heart and a wish and a prayer
Let's pray

These friends they come and go
But I got family, family
These kids so fast they grow
They learn so quickly now
That there's nowhere to go
That there's no future, future
Don't make this here so low
And we can't overcome, no

You tie my hands, what am I gonna be?
What have I done so bad? What is my destiny?
You tie my hands, what am I suppose to see?
What have I done so bad? What am I gonna be?

Yeah, and if you come from under that water then there's fresh air
Just breathe, baby, God's got a blessing to spare
Yes, I know the process is so much stress
But it's the progress that feels the best
Cause I came from the projects straight to success, and you're next
So try, they can't steal your pride, it's inside
Then find it and keep on grinding
Cause in every dark cloud, there's a silver lining, I know

Yeah, yeah, yeah
See right now we just riding on love
A shot in the dark
We ain't tryin to do nothing but hit the heart
We need love
That's all y'all, that's all

You tie my hands, what am I gonna be?
What have I done so bad? What is my destiny?
You tie my hands, what am I suppose to see?
What have I done so bad? What am I gonna be?
You tie my hands, what am I gonna be?
What have I done so bad? What is my destiny?
You tie my hands, what am I suppose to see?
What have I done so bad? What am I gonna be?

Yeah, born right here in the USA
But due to tragedy looked on by the whole world as a refugee
So accept my emotion
Do not take it as an offensive gesture
It's just the epitome of my soul and I must be me
We got spirit y'all, we got spirit
We got soul y'all, we got soul

Riding 'round like Pablo
Still talking that blanco
My Nina sing soprano
So we gon' leave on a high note
Come out my shell like Rafael
And crack yours like a taco
Lil Wayne tougher than John Wayne
Make him change his name to John Doe
It's me and my lil brother Capo
Lil Marly G and my bottom bitch
If I'm falling, it's bottomless
If I'm tripping, it's a power trip
Her pearl tongue like the pearly gates
And with that said, I climb the fence
My other bitches gotta ride the bench
And with that said... bitch you jealous
I'm fly like my dreadlocks propellers
I think I should headline Coachella
My woman a Queen like Coretta
And nigga you sleep with the Devil
I couldn't be Junior forever
I don't mean to ruffle your feathers
But I had to spread my wings
Ain't trying to get lemon-peppered
Got too many pistols, too many issues
Too many mistakes, too many miscues
Only made me better, it turned me into
The man I am today, I'm new and I'm improved
I got my shit right, it's just you and a tissue
Suit yourself because this suit is a rental
Now the snow is just coming in
Like I broke a window to an igloo
Slow a bitch down like ""Un momento""
I'd rather get screwed than scrutinized
I'd rather get used by a cutie pie
If she ain't fucking it's Uber time
I'd rather be advised than supervised
You do the math, we do the numbers
We pour champagne and expensive wine
In water guns and shoot each other
I get high, meditate like a monk
Preposterous when I get drunk
And my goons is wilder than Gronk
My do's is as bad as my don'ts
Met a kinda-cute bitch with a donk
As long as the bitch got a donk
And I smell like; pussy, money, and weed
She say ""Ooh, I like your cologne""
The last niggas tested us flunk
So please study hard, study long
Kill your wife, then take the bitch phone
And text you to please hurry home
And the rain drops turn into blood
Look like you just come in from a storm
And if all pussies come with walls
I hope you run into your own
Nigga
I come with that heroin flow
I come with that never before
My CMB days are dead
I ain't worried 'bout ghost
I married the MOB, we divorced
Hoo, and all that shit dead without me of course
It's nothing; a zombie, a corpse
You burnt yourself and was supposed to pass me the torch
Fuck it, I'll see you in Forbes, nigga
I'm sorry for the fucking wait
Was busy, searching my calendar for better days
I found 'em, you either turn the page or tear the page
Y. M., Young Money; never age

Bitch, you jealous, woo
And I was right, yeah
Tell a fuck nigga ""Bitch, you jealous""
Stuntin' on niggas
Stunt, stunt; the shit niggas don't like, yeah
Bitch you jealous
I'm sorry for the wait, apologetic, hey
Bitch you jealous
Now give us our cash and our credit, hey

Dreams And Nightmares,Sorry 4 the Wait 2,2015.0,"Turn the music down in my headphones, yeah
That noise in the background, that's my skateboard
That nigga Mack crazy
Yeah, uh

I put my shooters on they feet
I just give 'em your address, then go to sleep
The money turned my niggas into monsters
The white done turned my niggas into Nazis, Lord
The money turned my face into a stocking
Don't make me turn your baby to a hostage, boy
Don't make me turn the kid to a foster
My woman turn my dick into a Mazda, Lord
Body parts in the duffel
The bullets turn your body to a puzzle
The money turn my bitch into a monster
She know how to get a check and turn a zero to a comma, Lord
The money turn my niggas into killas
The sugar turnt the cocaine to vanilla
The money turnt the bitches into hoes
The money turned my niggas into foes, Lord
I put my shooters on they feet
Give 'em your address, then I go out to eat
Had that snowman in the hood like Jody Breeze
She from the hood but look like she from overseas
I said, ""Girl you know I love you and I care for ya
I got some new shoes and a bag of hair for ya""
She say, ""Fuck these other niggas, they ain't half of ya
Just keep laughing to the bank, it's hilarious""
I got a stay-at-home gun and a travel gun
Boy, we could sell white, in Africa
It's like, I can't explain, y'all asked me to spit
And now I'm drooling on my chain
""What happened to Wayne?""

I'm like, hold up, wait a second, y'all thought I was second?
Hating on a champ, throwing salt and not confetti
We pull up and we shoot, then we park the car and edit
Watch me pull up with no roof
Tthat's cause I walk the dog and pet it
I'm like, hold up, wait a minute, y'all thought I was finished?
Shoot you in your head, then just walk off like I didn't
Let my money talk so much, put my jawbone outta business
Doing numbers in this bitch, I'm like a smart phone with the digits
Bitch!
Riding 'round with the volume down
With the windows up and the choppers down
Soon as we get to your block
It's the motherfuckin' other way around
My bitch say I'm too wild
She don't even know why she stay around
I get home and I dick her down
Now she talking 'bout exchanging vows
If these bullets was paintballs
I could fuck around and I could paint a house
You could tell I'm pimpin'
Tthe way I hit the blunt with my pinkie out
I bring wine to Amy house
We smoke it out and we drank it out
And talk about these pussy niggas
Tthat ain't about what Wayne about
I'm hangin out a Mulsanne without a brain, it's out of its mind
I pull over, I push a button, it change like Optimus Prime
Speaking of change, it's a shame how these lames droppin' them dimes
We aim at your grape, knock it off, now you just vines
Blood Gang, red rain on these niggas, hot if you dry
My gang top of the line, hollerin' out ""Squad, take it outside""
I'm a taxpayer,
 I'm a axe player, gettin' in through the back well
Red devil to the blue collared, un-enveloped blackmail
Fed up with the fed shit and Fed-Ex lost my package
My white girls say ""Yeah, nigga!"" My white homies act blackish
Ain't tall enough for the NBA, I ain't big enough for the NFL
Should've  been in N.W.A., fuck the police, Five-0 and 12
One time for your mind, bitch, never say ""Nevermind,"" bitch
You a penny short of a dime, bitch, no nonsense
Had a nine since I was nine, bitch
Yeah, born to murder
Bank account on fat, bustin' out the girdle
Tell 'em boys ain't nothin' sweet, it's sauerkraut, ya heard me?
They find ya body in New Orleans on Mardi Gras on Bourbon
Like, oh, Lord, Humphrey Bogart
It's a bird, it's a plane, it's a crowbar

My heart races on

Uh, I'm priceless
Remember me like they remember the Titans
Reality bit me, and continue to bite me
Got no degree, but where I'm from that’s the original climate
Where you can’t tell a fiend a crack rock isn’t a diamond
Hold on
Lord, if my Bugatti come to a dead-end
I've already been everywhere except Heaven
And tomorrow’s not promised
When I'm gone but not forgotten
I hope my homies calming down my mama, Lord
I guess I'll see you on that other side
Where the flowers never die the angels never lie

I just hope my contribution will be memorized

Never looked into my daddy’s eyes

Searching for better days before a better person

I purchase
My children gifts and I just keep the curses

'Cause I'm never in my right mind

Life is just a race against time so have a good time
Heart racing, thoughts racing

I turn around and run backwards
To see what second place look like
Oh Lord, what are we running from?
The police, 'cause they already killed enough of us
Stay out them streets 'cause they don’t fuck with us
They hunting us
We in a race against racists, that’s a color run

I ain't a killer, but don't push me, like a red button

With real views and fake eyes

Your bears is cubs, your crocodile's toothless

Retire like Ewings, I'm high like I flew in
And my wife lookin' Jewish, wait
My money look Arabic, blunt lookin' Cuban
My eyes look Korean, the coke look Peruvian, wait
She European and she from Aruba, she from the States
Ass overseas, pussy foreign food, we overate
We throw them B's up high as the moon, suwu in space
I come from Mars, but I act like I'm from the Planet of the Apes
Mansion with a gate with some nice landscapes, the Atlantic across the way
Don't ask me what I make, I'ma be answerin' all day
Got a hammock, I'ma lay with a naked bitch with just a bandana on her face
And I just psstt, took off, errr- and landed on her face
I cannonballed her face
Fuck her to some Diana Ross and faint
Damn, I lost the faith
Don't judge me, I took the stand and fought the case
You can't avoid the Drac'
Drip Bayless, I'm feelin' Shannon Sharpe today
Big rocks in my mouth, can't remember how many asteroids I ate
Your pastor called today, I told him that your casket on the way
Now pass the phone to bae
I'm bringin' a pole, you dancin' on his grave

Fly to death, and your bitch just flew in
You a ref, my nigga, you blew it (You blew it)
I don't sketch, but the pistol, I drew it
Told myself to continue my duties
I got money from 2002, that I ain't seen since 2002
Me, Sean, and Brazy, my nigga, we boolin'
Ballin' so brazy, I dribble and shoot it
Just like I play for Emilio Pucci
I treat the Wraith like that bitch is Suzuki
I need a favorite woman like The Fugees
It's me, Sean, and Baby, we lit as Three Stooges
My skate stance is goofy, my bae ass is stupid
No fake asses truly, I'm makin' her moon me
Blatt, blatt, blatt, blatt, blatt

I don't talk shit, bitch, I do it (I do it)
They say, ""All facts,"" but don't prove shit (I knew it)
You in my way, need to move, bitch (Move bitch, huh)
Shut the fuck up, no excuses (Yeah, yeah)
This a win-win, swear I'm so choosy (Yeah, yeah)
Money spread on me like Boosie
Real ones ride for me, no cruise ship (Yeah, yeah)

I don't really sleep or take naps, no snoozin' (No snoozin')
All of these burners here hot, but we coolin' (Yeah, snorin')
I was playin' dumb, they was thinkin' I'm stupid
My accountant just called, said, ""Shit been movin'"" (Yeah)
I don't talk shit, bitch, I do it
My accountant just called, said, ""Shit been movin'""
Fake money, should keep your two cents (That mulah)
Catch a body like Ray Lewis (Yeah)
If you weigh me down, then I gotta remove you
If you in my way, then I gotta go through you

Fly Away,Dedication 6,2017.0,"Ahem
I'd like for you to take this time
And remember where you was
The first time you heard 
Dedication
If I asked you how many times you've listened to 
D2
Could you tell me?
Dedication 3
 was the first mixtape you heard when we had a Black president
D4
 and 
5
, we got back to business
Y'all done copied the rhymes
Y'all done stole the artwork
Tried to emulate my shit-talkin'
Weezy and Dram' — we are the Mixtape Blueprint
Hahaha! You welcome
A Dedication

I got Doja, Narcotics, and Actavis; that's DNA
Got a Dyke-ho, Nympho, And your bitch layin' next to me and bae
Eazy like NWA, they make me feel A-OK
Feeling like Tony, ""Grr-rr-reat!"";
 
feeling all on me, TSA
She got Dollars, Nut, and Alcohol all over her T&A
She snort all this KKK,
 and this broad need AAA
Let's enjoy some NBA,
 
y'all lil boys NCAA
Yeah we got A-M-M-O, but you'll get beat like MMA
I got Dracos, Ninos, Automatics; that's my DNA
You'll get beat like Sugar Ray, TKO,
 O-H-H
I smoke O's, I sip Ace, I pop whole Xanies straight
I got P's, I got weight, I got kis, I got gates
I got moonrock, molly, ecstasy, inside this weed, it's laced
I smoke doobies, don't smoke J's
Don't watch movies, don't go to plays
I watch cuties, porn, and play
I got Uzis on the way
I don't be choosey, I don't be safe
I don't get woozy, I get the waist
My bitch ballin' like Zhané,
 
Erykah Badu with the fade
Capital-WNBA, I just teach her how to save
I been sleepin' with my AK, with my finger around her waist
I been dreamin' I caught a body —
That's some sweet dreams, who want a taste?
Give the American dream to a bitch that ain't even from the USA
That's the land of the Free, it's the home of AJ
Got a whole brick of some yay, I put one line on the plate
She's gon' take it to the face, like ""thin line between love and hate""
I got Dealers 'N' Associates, call that my DNA
All these diamonds, all this gold and shit, call that PB&J
I got Bloods in LA, I got Bloods down in the A
I got Bloods everywhere you lay but ain't no blood in my filet
Hit the court, shoot the DA, treat beef like USDA
OMW to your trap, 
(Blap!)
, now I'll be On My Way
I got plugs I ain't got to pay, I got shit I ain't got to say
I got cribs way out of state, I ain't got no more pocket space
Sippin' slo-mo at my pace,
 
lean like I wear a brace
Queens want to be embraced, Kings want to be an Ace
I remember Ace of Spades, I remember the Goose is Grey
Now it's Bumbu by the case, nigga, fuck you, fly away
Six shit,

Dedicated
To the culture that Tunechi birthed
To the sons and daughters of Weezy
Y'all niggas still watching a master at work
I already got...
D6

I already got the Ganja
I already got the Fanta
All black like Uganda
Hair back like E. Honda
, wait
Hardhat like a condom
Your skull crack, then we crowned you
Shark bite to a flounder
Bar fight to a bouncer, wait
All Franks like Sinatra
Face been painted, they ain't never clowned him
Everybody rakin' cash like it's autumn
Y'all boys sweeter than Whatchamacallit
All y'all take a seat on this toilet
Y'all ain't shit, but y'all piss-poor, and
Sittin' in the foreign like I'm on a Harley
Keep bloodsuckers away with the garlic
Alone in a mansion, I'm Macaulay Culkin
Thought about your coffin and started barfin'
Thought about your orphans, how they probably starvin'
Thought about this artful shit, how I'm so thoughtful
Walkin' on the marble, feelin' like Ricardo
Walkin' 'round like the campus of Harvard
Shoutout my nigga Swizz, niggas gettin' smarter
Try to hit the books, and nigga hit the target
Sittin' on the charter, talkin' 'bout the targets
Waitin' on departure, waitin' on a sculpture
Make sure my vultures keep an extra cartridge
And make sure my Barbies keep an extra Barbie
My dick is her electric chair, feel the voltage
And her pussy better smell like a orchid
Wetter than a wishin' well, need a quarter
Damn, I wish I was a lil bit taller
Damn, I wish I drank a lil more water
Damn, my weed stank a lil more harder
Damn, I pull up with a redbone, scarlet
With a yellowbone car
Smoke green, that's Marley
Purple and the orange, you seen, that's horror
No Eve in my garden, F-R-uh, F-R-uh
All the Gs in my corner, them boys so warriors
Believe we deserve every leaf in the forest
Kis and quarters layin' around my headquarters
Borderline hoarder, you a mortal, I report her
World on my shoulders but it's lighter than a clover
I'm your bitch, baby, hold me tighter than a stroller
System so solar, got white like Crayola
Nut like granola all in your bitch rollers
You never been in jail, I never been in a Corolla
Then I roll a blunt 'bout as thick as a Samoan
This is that six shit, the sickness is showin'
The sickness is spreadin', the disease is growin'
The bitches is hoein', the witnesses knowin'
The dollars are torn, they're fishin' for coins
I continue goin', 
I get to the boar and
I rip off his horns, six in the mornin'
Then I just yawn and forget to mourn and
Give to the star, it's 6, the reward",https://genius.com/Lil-wayne-fly-away-lyrics

I tell her that that pussy for me, just in case she thought it was ours
And she say cool
And if you like it I love it
If she like it I love it

See we ain't got much in common, so we don't do that much talking

New Slaves,Dedication 5,2013.0,"I got old money, take a bath in hundreds
My way or the highway and I see traffic comin'
It's Tunechi in this ho, watch them hoes go crazy
Pass that weed around, like that shit contagious
And I got news for all these snitches, tell them feds stop bitchin'
If pussy lips could talk, I'd go down there like it's whisperin'
You know life is so uncertain and death is so unwanted
My navigation system say, ""It's death around the corner""
I got a condo for a stash house, a condo for a stash house
Get that boy a mirror, so he can watch his damn mouth
See I get it from Sosa, he got it from Frank
And Sosa alright, but I'm tryin' to meet Frank
He said business is well, he ain't got no complaints
You'll be Batman and I'll be robbin' the bank
I know I ain't gon' fall, even though I'm power trippin'
Glass house nigga, you see how I'm livin'
I know that we the new slaves, I know that we the new age
Ain't no such thing as too paid

Like it's freezing and you naked, shake that ass ho
Shake that ass ho

When we throw a pool party, we put sharks in the pool
I got Bloods in the cut, so don't throw salt in the wound
AK wet niggas up, I don't throw water balloons
Better call the platoon
If it's fuck it then fuck it, 
now you speakin' my language
Put your dead body under them white sheets with no blankets
I'm so rich I go pour
Champagne and don't drink it
Ice on my neck like I fainted
These are the thoughts of the brainless
No new friends, we don't talk to strangers
Man I'm so serious with this pimp shit
Full clip in my Mac 10
Ain't no exit out the game, nigga cut off your blinkers
And if she married I fuck her, if she lonely I fuck her
If she crazy I love her, y'all just don't understand her
She say you got it made, I say no I got a butler
They tell me to turn up, but I'm the knob on the oven
I got a knife in my pocket if there's a fork in the road
I'm the man of steel, but I won't say what I stole
Bring that coke to the stove, and whip it like a new slave
Whip it like a new slave

Whattup five
Take that coke to the stove
And whip it like a new slave, whip it like a new slave
Like it's freezing and you naked shake that ass ho",https://genius.com/Lil-wayne-new-slaves-lyrics
Fuckin’ Problem,Dedication 5,2013,"I love all my bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
A two dollar bill is still a couple dollars
And if any one of them niggas got a fuckin' problem
I'mma milk all of 'em cause they fuckin' cowards
I love red bitches, there's just something 'bout 'em
But I'm gettin' better pussy from a brown one
Been schoolin' y'all niggas, I'm your alma mater
I'm the shit, where the fly swatter

I know you dykin' who you eatin' on
Make me think about all them nights we got a threesome on
Make me think about how you suck it like your teeth are gone
If your friends hatin' on you, fuck 'em to each his own, yessir
I do my drugs then I sleep 'em off
Like it just be callin' me, I need to turn my ringer off
Ain't a fuckin' singalong unless you brought the weed along
That kush, okay I got it, that kush
Cop pounds and put my people on
We can take the stairs up to the stars that's where we belong
Fuck that shit you talk, I beat that pussy like production
Or like Rocky, beat the Russian, or like Jordan, beat the buzzer
Nigga, gimme what you've got, take that money like an usher
One man band, all you hear is repercussion
Told a bitch, too much selfish gonna lead to self destruction
She looked me in my eyes and said
Man, I ain't worried 'bout nothin', I said shorty, you a beast

I love bad bitches, okay, what's the problem
If she thinks she gonna come up then I'mma fuckin' drown her
I'm wilder than public schools and public housing
Can't afford failure, I'm just browsing
I was 15 with $100,000
And if you talk trash I'mma fuckin' possum
And nigga, if your bitch got eye problem
You know what it is, armed robbery
Tunechi

I heard 'em tell me ""Go get 'em, young""
I haven't seen a movie since I started livin' one
I be in a room full of bitches gettin' drunk
Smokin' like a point guard, no look, passin' blunts
Fuck you talkin' 'bout? Euro, this and that
Wanna walk in these shoes? Have the outfit to match
And niggas schemin' on what I had, but
We gon' put money in the bag or a body in the bag (You choose)
And all these new bitches old news
Throwin' stacks at 'em like ""That's prolly gon' bruise""
And every dream girl that I fucked came true
Now every night feels like deja vu
And the hatin's no use, she ain't waitin' on you
I tell a baby, ""Tell ya man kick rocks with no shoes""
And I murder that pussy, and I ain't leave a clue
Cause I put her on her knees and made her swallow all the proof
That sick shit, I'm ill, yeah, I'm a fuckin' problem
I'm fine wit' it, though, bitches like fuckin' problems
And I can't solve shit if I'm the fuckin' problem
Just know I got 'em, let me know if there's a fuckin' problem
Out the city, but you can't take the city out 'em
I know these hoes well, see the water spittin' out 'em?
Long story short, money always colorblind
She blew the team for some Red Bottoms
(Euro)

I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin problem
Had a few ugly bitches but I had to hide em
Can't live with em, Can't live without em
Can't trust them hoes poking holes up in condoms
Put a S on her breast, she a supermodel
If you swallow these kids, does that make you childish
Now she say I got a fuckin problem
Because I fucked her once and gave a fuck about her
Her hair blown out like the 80s
I drive these bitches crazy, mental asylum should pay me
I ain't looking for a lady, call Will Smith to get you hitched
I ain't looking for a wife, I need a one night trick
That can ride it like that, suck it like this
Hit it from the back in the back of the whip
I'm a mac, I'm a pimp girl
You don't need make up, put this mac on your lips
She drive a X5, beefin' with her ex man
Baby Ima dog and a DMX fan
Told myself I wouldn't mess with my ex again
Popped a lil x then i tried explain
I keep it too real to ever be a lame
Too many girls in this world, you all be lame
She all on my dick cause I got street fame
Told that thirsty ass bitch don't speak my name
Kidd Kidd, a nut from the 9
Tell em don't worry bout me I'm just fine
Girl if you comin' with me then let's ride
I know you want money so don't waste my time
Uh, wear that ass out fuck her till we pass out
Fuck a hotel, we goin' to my mans house
Scratch that your baby mama was an Amtrak
We treat that pussy like some good weed and pass that
Yeah, to my niggas, she fuck my niggas
Bought some bitches, and she was wit' it
With you she wasn't, but she did it
She let you lick it, but never stick it
You be trippin, you say you fallin
Nigga you slippin, stupid ass nigga tryna' fall in love
If i fall it's gon be from too many drugs
You asking questions, bout what she was
With the rider game, she told you in the club",https://genius.com/Lil-wayne-fuckin-problem-lyrics

Cocaine, like co cripple
Heard niggas been waitin' on me, well I might as well go and tip 'em
I'm smokin' on that Hulk Hogan
I call shots, you call forward
I pimp my ride, my car's ho-in'
And all my bars be barcoded
These YMCMB stars glowin'
Hate a ho-nigga, like anchovies
My young bitch keep on snappin' on me, I told that bitch I ain't posing
That pussy feel like a pot of gold
The money old and the night is young
All them niggas keep talkin' shit
I make you eat your words and bite your tongue
And when the guns ring I'm the ring leader
Got those ho's on pins and needles
I'm so high I left Earth
And ran into Venus and Serena
Get head like a mind reader
You washed up, I'm the dry cleaner
Don't worry about me, nigga I'm one-
Hundred like a high fever
Got pounds takin' up closet space
Guns all in my bitch crib
Since all you nigga's fly now, bugs all on my windshield

And if she tense, then I'mma rub her back
She alright, I think I fuck with her
Man, I wish a motherfucker would
I feel like a hockey puck nigga
Way too cold to die young, way too young to die sober
Way too cold to die young, give these niggas the cold shoulder
Sleepin' with a bad bitch, another bitch when I roll over
We fuck until we fall asleep, wake up and do it all over

I pull up on em bumping Keith Sweat
Them niggas never see me sweat
And tell the press I'm not depressed, I just had to press reset
I just had to get me set, and I'm not playin' skip recess
I'm a different Weezy, and I'm drippin' Fiji
In a Lamborghini with the seats wet
Hardest lesson is regret
Snorting powder on the P jet
Ask the pilot are we there yet
He said we on the ground, and we ain't leave yet
Had to step back and take a deep breath
It's hard as heck to show 'em respect
I love 'em to death but they ain't dead yet
Don't know how long I'm able to repeat that
Me I'm just tryin' to see the bread stretch
These niggas tryna see dread stress
Me, I'm just tryin' to see the dead rest
And I can't rest if I ain't pray yet

Father forgive them for their wrongdoings
For they do not know what they are doing, Amen

Can't lie we blessed, safe deposit box where I hide the check
Wear a hockey jersey just to hide the vest
I talked to God he deny the stress
I make women cry when they next to me
They say they blessed to be next to me
Give my kids my heart, put my mind in my music
And I let them hoes get the rest of me
Can't let this cold world get the best of me
Got the recipe for my destiny
Yeah I want them mills like Stephanie
Want the blue face hundreds preferably
This is the bounce back this is God's work
This is hard work, this is our work
This is all night graveyard work
Man this beat is godly
So I'm takin' off like a screechin' Harley
Watch the women wave cause I'm freakin' gnarly
Percs and purp got me sleepin' calmly
So I wake up and I chase the check
'Cause we ain't promised life, but we promised death
But we gon win, and I promise that
Young Money Records, you should honor that
And my vicious city got respect for me
Got killas to get at yo neck for me
You get the best of me, until the death of me
And the second me gon be the better me
Be grateful

Hittas,Tha Carter V,2018.0,"Is it true you performed with Willie Nelson at the Country Music Awards?
I don't know, but I know I did perform at this bad ass bitch birthday party recently. She was crazy, stupid thick

Mack in here
Pooh in here
Scoob in here with me

Tell them hoes get they mind right, tell them niggas back up
Man, I heard the truth is hard to swallow, do you have cups?
Used the rope to hang myself to tie a money bag up
Tell ’em get they iron right before Iron-Man come
Tell 'em bring my car around, tell 'em bitches lap up
I’ma cut this music down, tell 'em put they APs up
Tell 'em throw they pride out, roll the windows back up
Money in the air, who said white men can't jump?
Catch that nigga late night on the phone at a gas pump
Let me get the phone and the car once it's gassed up
AK-47 make a sittin' duck stand up
I could let it blast, but I much rather have one
Tell 'em bring my car around, tell 'em bitches lap up
Then them hoes get passed down, then them hoes get passed up
Sittin’ on this money to me feel like a cactus
I’m stickin' to this shit, you would’ve been have hopped yo' ass up

Tell 'em, I got hittas woadie (Hittas woadie)
I got, yeah I got plenty woadie
I got hittas woadie (Hittas woadie)

Goddamn, these snitches nosy, goddamn, these snitches nosy
Nigga, I'm a ass with that semi; call me semicolon
Yeah I got hittas woadie, yeah I got plenty woadie
They kick the door and kill yo’ ass and leave the children snorin'
I'm sippin' lean out a glass, make me feel important
I made some green in the past and now it's good as golden, yeah

Clearly, Lil Wayne answers to no one

I got hittas, woadie

I got hittas, woadie (Hittas woadie)

I'm so lifted, I'm so lifted
I wrote my will in hieroglyphics (In hieroglyphics)
Weezy, where you been? The people miss you
Crickets
I got hittas and they not kidders, that's my niggas
You got niggas but they not hittas, they got jitters
They get hit up, I'm placin' figures on your niggas
Takin' bidders, yo' bae, yo' niggas, don't make a difference
I got shooters, on pharmaceuticals​, they armed and brutal
Armed intruders, 'cause we don't doodle, we draw conclusions
I got sprayers, all type of sprayers, we gon' need Google
I got paper, on top of paper, we gon' need rulers
I'm effective, been doin' numbers since Roman numerals
Strong as sumo, we armed as usual, my hittas hungry
Charleston Chew you, bazookas chew you, just like Bazookas
Don't confuse 'em, we only hittas, y'all only humans
Don't get hit up, woadie (Hit up, woadie, hit up, woadie)

I just licked my thumb and thumbed through that pussy like a catalog
All my niggas wanna fuck, and she gon let us like a salad bar
Yeah that's right, real shit, murderer, I kill kill
Cash Money, cash cow that never cry over spilled milk
I'm way high on the highway, my girl call to get my lies straight
That machine gun go ""brrrrr"" like I got that bitch on vibrate
Niggas think they hot, I cut off the hand they fan with
Call me DMX, cause I keep me a bad bitch
T called some of them hoes up, Marley G roll up
I'm gettin' bread like cold cuts, she suck dick till her nose run, yeah
A rich nigga that that shit they don't like
All you niggas pussies, none of you pussies tight
Gettin' head while I drive make me run lights
These hoes wanna ride my dick you gotta hitchhike
No lie, I'm fuckin' bitches and gettin' paid
She suck my dick for 60 seconds and swallow all my Minute Maid
No lie, I'm gettin' paid and fuckin' bitches
The Feds on me, gotta switch plates
In the streets we call that washin' dishes
Left hand on that steering wheel, right hand on the nine-milly
T-roll my blunt long as a lifespan then I kill it
Eatin' pussy, tongue kissin' and all that
She ridin' a nigga so fast, my dick feel like it's been carjacked
Two guns drawn, art class, what that is that's y'all ass
Mo' money, mo' money, we gettin' mow like tall grass
We are not one and the same
Blood is the gang, it run in my veins
I bagged your bitch then fuck her
Now come get your bitch from baggage claim, nigga!
Dr. Carter, fuck her harder
All my homies bald, nigga
And guess what? I'm the barber
I'm too high; if I come down my fat pocket's my shock absorber
Like Hank Gathers I'mma die a baller, you flamin' faggots put him out with water

See 1, 1 makes you realize
2, that’s when the game became ours
See 3, that’s when we showed you the future
This here, it’s for the sport
Some of you niggas mad the sport normally happens to be skateboarding
But that gives us 4 wheels to roll over you niggas
D4, and dedication!

She’s so sophisticated
She'll catch a nigga nut and then refrigerate it
I wear a rubber and we fuck 'til we dehydrated
I pull it out bust on her face and call her cry baby
I kiss her neck, I kiss her stomach, then I kiss that pussy
And then I eat it from the back, but I don’t do crack
And then I get this monster hard and ask her where to put it
She tell me, Tunechi, hit it raw, I tell her bitch you crazy
Don’t want no HIV, don’t need that Honeymoon In Vegas
It’s YMCMB the fucking alpha and omega
The presidential double R, call that Ronald Reagan
I fuck your bitch, we come together call that congregating
I be balling on these niggas, Sports Illustrated
Tough in the streets, but you in the court with a statement
Ain’t that a bitch and I kill everybody but the babies
Give that bitch nigga the blues 'til he fucking navy
Yeah, man I be riding round with that yopper
I pop a nigga like 
All you hoes get topless, suck this dick 'til it’s spotless
Too many hoes: I got options
I ain’t never tripping, you could have the bitch
And I’ma send her back with her pussy lips, looking just like camel lips
You fucking with some real nigga, blow your fucking head off
They say life is a bitch, I hope that bitch a redbone
All I know is get money, bitch ain’t getting shit from me
Fuck a six pack, six bullets give you six stomachs
Tell her how that pussy tastes, she been eating pineapples
Throw her back like a quarterback, hit that ass like a linebacker
Put that pussy on me, we caught up in the moment
AK with a hair trigger, nigga don’t make me comb it
This like a full time job not to kill niggas
Some of my homeboys' job is to kill niggas
Yeah, cause I’m still on probation
Write your name on a bullet that’s a Dedication, 4

Y'all ready?
Yeah, welcome to Dedication 4

Oh yeah I do, yeah I do
Who the fuck is Stevie J?

Don't be lookin' for no donations
You get dick, then reservations
I get pussy then hibernation
I start humpin' soon as I wake up
I woke up in some new punani
He woke up bleedin' like ""who shot me?""
I kept shootin'; Boo said ""you got 'em""
Now, all we gotta do is get rid of the body
But anyway I woke up in some new punani

I was drunk as a bitch, drunk as a bitch
But not drunk as that bitch
I got in that shit acted donkey in it
Junk in her trunk, hope my trunk key can fit
Then she jumped on my dick like a monkey and shit
Monkey see monkey do, banana clips
Shoot at them niggas, no camera glitch
Wax that ass, no candle stick
And I run with some killers I eat with the mob
Got some shit built up I keep it inside
Red in my eyes, Mount Everest high
Look dead in my eyes, see death in my eyes
The TEC on my thigh and my aim so good
I could shoot a fly or a bull in the eye
Hold up, all bullshit aside
A nigga almost died but I'm outchea
Fuck around with a real nigga get murked
I been paid my dues will I get reimbursed?
Love it when she make faces
Pussy feel like vacation
Eat it like I'm dyin' of starvation
I'm at the finish line, her heart racin'
Give her to Fuke if she Caucasian
My niggas wild as Jumanji
You can call me an S.O.B
Cause its skateboards over bugattis
I used to be at them Heat games
With better seats than Pat Riley
Don't stop, pop that don't stop
Pop that Ollie, Tunechi

Sippin' on dumb, puffin' a J
Met her tonight, fuck her today
You tuck her away, I'm fuckin' her face
Wine head, she's guzzling grapes
Back shots, I'm holding her waist
Freaky, I always freak...
You know Tune my bro, but he ain't tryna meet ya
Just bring your friend, both of us'll eat her
Hater niggas be hungry
Got a hundred shots to feed 'em
Her panties are down, her legs is up
We finally fucked, she starved for months
Don't give a fuck, still I'll hit
Never no feelings, no love for these hoes
No flowers, we're simple, we fucked in the Rolls
No flowers, we're simple, we fucked in the Rolls
Royce - trick!
Now they mad, I told they was
Bitches'll be lying, I did the same
Far from a square, don't mistake me for lame
She's suckin' me off, I'm pokin' her brain
She tell me keep goin', I'm doin' my thing
That pussy so wet, I'm calling it rain
I'm giving her hundreds, she's keeping my change
I keep it a hundred, you do the same
Most women front, but who do you blame?
I gave you dick, you gave me pussy
It's safe to say it's an even exchange...
Bitch!

Don't be givin' out information
You know niggas still on probation
I get higher than expectations
You know this is the Dedication

Uh, I'm wildin' out on my skateboard, she ridin' dick like race cars
My blunt longer than spacebars, I'm gettin' higher than quasars
I beg your pardon, I egg your noggin, got Nin up in my glove compartment
I'm so short, yellow bus retarded, my flow hard, these niggas carpet
I'm Tunechi, I do me, smoke doobies, tote uzis
I make that bitch cum 'til she come to a conclusion
I'm ill as an illusion, I got B's like a student
Bitch I am not a human
 and this dick is therapeutic
She say, ""Tunechi give that dick to me, smoother than a symphony""
Two bad bitches at the same time, symmetry
Murder you no sympathy, got medal like olympians
Tee put the weed in the blunt like a parentheses
Fuck y'all niggas I'm gettin' me, is you kiddin' me?
That big booty, them pretty feet
Them swishas' sweets with that purp
Church - with the priest
That red-boned get licked to sleep, she'll wake up and get dicked to sleep
Pickled meat, freaky deak, I test these niggas with a cheat-sheet
Her clit look like a jelly bean, I'm on that promethazine
Blow your ass to smithereens, kush strong like Mr. Clean
I'm a king I have a dream, money flippin' trampoline
Money flippin' balance beam, fresher than the prince, the king, and the queen
That's your bitch if my celly ring and I kiss her belly ring
Put that dick up in her spleen, I shine like afro sheen
And I eat pussy, she suck dick at the same damn time
That's a 69, then pass her to my slime
I'm skatin' and rappin' at the same damn time
I said I might retire, but y'all know I be high
I did that time, I paid that fine
Fuck around and go to jail for the same damn crime
For the same damn crime? Na, murder this time
Potato on the end of the barrel, french fries
I'm rich bitch, Trukfit in Macy's!
And you pussy niggas hatin' like a racist
Totally dude, I'm white boy wasted
She can't wait to take her drawers off like braces
Yeah, Scooby got another one, smokin' on that bubble gum
Two dutch bitches, double dutch, I'm the shit, bubble guts
Nigga get your duffles up, don't know if it's love or lust
Tell that ho to suck it up, she got lips like rubber ducks
That pussy whack, I'm one and done, trouble some I'm troublesome
Got two bitches off twitter, Tweedle-Dee and Tweedle-Dum
Single ladies, double cups, I'm tighter than a cummerbund
Smokin' on that strong, my blunt a fucking muscle punk

Fuck with me wrong I'll put your head in your hands
There'd be blood everywhere, I got Bloods everywhere
I'm a alien, I hope you ain't the Prince of Bel Air
That's real nigga talk, these niggas speechless
Cut off his arm and leg like I charge for my features
Hammer on my side like I work in construction
Your bitch hit that head so hard we get concussions
Niggas can't see me, not even a glimpse
Too many banana clips, I feel like chimps
South Beach bitch and her tan line stupid
You could find me on Collins like Bootsy
I ain't on no fuck shit,
 
I be on that Truk Fit
Your girl do tongue tricks and you sweeter than one six
All I ever see is Ben Franklin face
I chase the bank, I don't bank with Chase
You fuckin' with some niggas that'll murk y'all
Nigga you softer than a motherfuckin' Nerf ball
Bird call, brr, what happened to that boy?
He was talkin' shit, we put a clap into that boy

He's dead chap, that man's dead back there
It was worse than dead, his brain is gone

Smiling, laughing, screaming my name like that
I never see your crazy face (Mula)

Dead man walkin', through a dead plant garden
Red ants army, Caveman Spartan
Die, come back to life, shaved and corporate
I paved and carved it, made man forfeit
Laid and chalked him, I slaved then bossed it
I don't need flowers around my grave, I need maids and doormen
We not one and the same;
Casper the Friendly, Tunechi Cobain
Ask how I'm livin'? I can't complain
Like, it's hot in hell, but it never rain
Shit never sweet, him never changed
I'll always be the MF'er Wayne
I been lost conscious, I never regain
Bitches wanna sleep with my remains, lawd

Them Xans got me walkin' 'round like a zombie
I just double parked the hearse by a fire hydrant
They throw flowers on my body, allergic to pollen
Rest In Peace to the Cash Money Weezy
Gone but not forgotten, no

Dead man walkin', the weed I'm sparkin'
Stank like corpses, got a young nigga coughin'
I was larger than life, should've got a bigger coffin
Bad bitches in my coffin, suck dick 'til they cough
How long will they mourn me?
I had a Rolls Royce Ghost
Now I'm feelin' like that motherfucka comin' back to haunt me
We are not one and the same;
I fumble my brain, I'm nothin' but strange
I punctured my veins, I'm loving the pain
I'm ugly and vain, now go get that shovel and dump it on Wayne
Throw dirt on my name, picture on a shirt instead of a frame
I'm dead as a doorknob and I got it locked
So fuck every key on your key chain, boy

Them Xans got me walkin' 'round like a zombie
I don't know if I'm comin' or goin', Lord, I'm undecided
Throw flowers on my body, allergic to pollen
Rest In Peace to the Cash Money Weezy, gone but not forgotten

And they look like they saw Lucifer
Rrr
Welcome to the funeral
We not welcome, we intruded, though
You wanted smoke until you blew the smoke
(Phew)
That's just unexcusable
Welcome to the funeral, where we from, we ruin them
We been to quite a few of 'em
The reverend talk, we booin' him
We throw up the Piru at him

Welcome to the funeral, closed casket as usual
Soul snatching, that's usual
Amen, hallelujah though
Whole family delusional
Niggas cryin' like two-year-olds
Bullet holes come through the doors
I just crossed my heart, then I threw a rose
Damn, welcome to your funeral
Everybody knew you, bro
Ain't nobody shootin', though
Gotta die to see who you know
Damn, welcome to the funeral
Where we from, we ruin them
The preacher preach, we shootin' him
Now we need one for you and him
That's why they should cremate ya
Hope when you die they commemorate you
Life is a movie and it's in theaters
Some of y'alls already went to cable
Get shot from afar, you can get a facial
Black gun, chrome gun, interracial
Weed so strong, need ventilation
Funeral home need renovation
I got your mom's teary-eyed, that's precipitation
Nigga, when you died, did your bitch a favor
Nigga, we gon' mob like the Genoveses
Nigga, fat mob, I'ma Jenny Craig 'em

Snipers never hit a baby, crib or cradle
Sit tomatoes on your head and split tomatoes
From a hundred feet away, now it's a halo
That's tomato sauce, Heinz 57
Catch up, nigga, you behind, where I left you
I hate your bitch, your mom, and your fellas, kids, cousins
Uncles, aunts, and your nephew (Pfft)
Shoot a pussy nigga in the face, closed casket
Look his pretty kid in the face, poor bastard
Tears runnin' down his bitch face, romantic
Two straps on me like the old Bo Jacksons (Bah)
In his face, closed casket
Send him on the highway to heaven, no traffic
My lil' nigga just caught a body, he ecstatic
He cried tears of joy, then he got 'em tatted
Welcome to the funeral, closed casket as usual

What kind of cologne do you wear because all I could smell is fear nigga
Y'all don't want no problems up in here
Boy I'm from New Orleans where the dope fiends kill niggas
Brains came out his fucking ear
I got a full clip, I empty the whole thing up in here
Now I'mma keep a pill and a blunt
I might pass the motherfucker but most likely I'mma flunk
Tell my bitch I could do bad on my own
She say ""You gon' miss me nigga."" I say ""Bitch the thrill is gone""
I ain't drove it look better in the driveway
Married to the MOB, man you niggas just some bridesmaids
Bitches give me head instead of playing mind games
Tattooed tears for my homies, it's a cryin' shame
You could get a Dom P bottle to your face
Niggas just construction workers, trynna build a case
Males shouldn't be jealous that's a female trait
Why your bitch blowing me up? If I answer, I deflate
Motherfucker I'm like
Y'all don't want no problems up in here
I fuck her 'til she cry, make that ho drink her fuckin' tears
Lord, I hope she swallow more than tears
Then her homegirl came in the room and volunteered
Man, dreads hanging out the ski mask
Run up in your house, the couch potatoes getting mashed
Run up in the kitchen get your stash out the oven
You wonder how we know? stop talking while you cuddlin'
Ain't nothing like some pussy when you going through something
Just called a bad bitch, I said I'm going through something
Bugatti sitting still, look like it's going 200
Pussy nigga keep your mouth closed like you chew onions

Rather be judged by my jewelry, not a jury of my peers
And I got some kush to hide in her brassiere
And we only selling what the boat bring here nigga
Y'all don't want no problems up in here
Cause I got shooters on the roof like some fucking reindeer
And I'm probably with the model of the year
I'm about to go Pac with the nose ring up in here
Uh, lifestyles of the rich and famous
Young Money motherfucking Entertainment
And y'all know Marley got the chopper up in here

Treat the pussy like revolving doors
Ran outta rubbers at the corner store

Well, give me brains since you a smart-aleck
Fuck her all night and don't smell it
Open her mind like a watermelon, haha, you jealous

Kobe Bryant,UnKnown,2009.0,"I want to be the best
I want to be the best, simple and plain
That's why I play the game
And to be the best you have to win
And that's what drives me

He's the best player in the game
It's just that simple
There's nothing that Kobe Bryant can't do
He will defend your best player
He will shoot from the perimeter
He will get all in yo' mug
He will do whatever it takes
He is the most complete basketball player
In the game today - bar none
He has an assassin's mentality
I said this week, I said this when the trade went down
And I will repeat it again
Who's starving more for an NBA World Championship
More than Kobe Bryant
There is no one
This guy is highly motivated
What separates Kobe from the pack
More than Kobe Bryant, there is no one

Kobe doin' work
2-4 on my shirt
He the greatest on the court
And I'm the greatest on the verse
Going for the fourth ring like it was his first
Gotta get the gleam
Do it for Kareem
Two-four so nice, my flow so mean
Catch me at the game sitting next to Goldstein
Kobe Bryant Nikes, purple gold strings
Kobe in the game dunkin' on the whole
Black Mamba, attack, conquer
Basketball beast, rap monster
Crossover good, or turnaround jumper
Or just drive the lane and dunk on dunkers
You know where it's goin', it's goin' down yo
This is the Lakeshow, but don't drown though
I call him King Bryant, now let the crown show

I'm definitely, I'm just lost for words
I mean, he's amazing

Pass me the damn ball
I don't need a pick at all
And don't worry 'bout my shot
Cause I'ma get that off
Yea, I drops 40 on your double team
Then I drop 81 on another team
Yeah, you better guard me with caution
And watch I work 'em like a auction
No such thing as exhaustion
No time for resting
Cause I don't take breaks
I just break records
And I prefer the ball with three seconds
And I bet we gon' win it all in three seconds
Ya dig
That is a guarantee
Apparently
And please tell your defense
Don't ever man to man with me
Double team, triple team
Your defenders sick of me
But, I never let 'em get to me
Literally
Step back and give 'em a three
Ain't no defending me

One guy certainly envious of the way Bryant's playing lately, LeBron James
I've been quoted saying that
He's definitely the best player in our league
Um, to me, in my eyes
The best scorer in our league
And there's not another guy in our league
That can accomplish some of the things
That he's doing

Never take a day off
Catch you at the top of the key
And get a J off
Baseline face time
Tongue out like two-three
Even two-three gotta love how I do me
Practice while you sleep
Practice in my sleep
Straight outta high school
Tha brackets ain't for me
I will be jumpin' over you
Like I got a mattress at my feet
And all is Phil Jackson say is you
Better be passin' it to me
I put the master in the piece
Attack you like a beast
And I am starvin' for victory
And that means I'mma eat
And when they ask you who's the best
Then the answer should be me

Seckbach: Who's the best player in the NBA
Mikael: Um, I'll say Kobe Bryant
Seckback: Really? Why
Mikael: Because you never know what you're gonna get!

Call me Mr. Clutch or Mr. Automatic
I can post 'em up, or Lamar go get the alley
I'm going for the ring
I'm going for the ring
I went to Beijing
And came back with the bling
Who they want
They want Kobe
And what he want
He want the trophy
The victory
And the glory
No Shaq
No Robert Horry
Now break 'em off, Kobe break 'em off, yeah
You better be where that Laker don't, yeah
Just give him the ball and he take it off, yeah
Or he properly dishing it to Gasol, yeah
Or give it to D-Fish on the wing, yeah
Or just let lil' Ariza do his thing, yeah
Cause I'm great, and so is my team, yeah
Uh, do it for Magic
It's your time baby
I see nothin' wrong with doin' it four times baby
I'm the best yes
And he the best yeah
Don't worry LeBron - get 'em next year
Now what's defense
To an assassin
Killer instinct
Murder the basket
Then steal the ball back
Hold it for ransom
It's more than a game
This is a passion
Been a all-star, been a champion
Free throw line, you hear 'em chanting
MVP, MVP
Kobe Bryant aka MV-me
In knee deep, smash any D
Whoever he is he can't guard me
He can't guard me

""So, there you have it. The overwhelming answer was ... Kobe Bryant""",https://genius.com/Lil-wayne-kobe-bryant-lyrics

Stop playing, I'm fresher than a Degree stick

And I ain't even mention cigarettes or airplanes
So grab a Sprite, here's a pint we can share, Wayne
Yeah mayne, tastes so sweet
And I ain't gonna have a seat cause I don't wanna fall asleep
So just pour it in my drink and I'ma sip until I lean hard
Drank got me moving slower than a retard
So press record, and hear these hot raps (You know I got 'em)
I'm in the booth, cup on me like a jock-strap
 (I ain't lying)
And I will not nap until the bottle's empty
Then I pour a little more for Pat, Screw and Pimp C (Rest in peace)
And I would stop but believe that I can't
So 'til Short is gone, it's just me and my drank, my drank

Up in the studio, me and my drank
Me and my drank, me-me and my drank
Up-up-up in the studio, me and my drank
Me and my drank, me-me-me and my drank
Up in the studio, me and my drank
Me and my drank, me-me and my drank
Up-up-up in the studio, me and my drank
Me and my drank, me-me-me and my drank
[Outro: Lil Wayne & 
Short Dawg
]
Me and my drank
Up in the studio, someone pour another four
Oh, oh, yeah
I told the bitch one more ounce will make me feel so great
Wait, now I can't feel my face
Will somebody please, please double cup me?
And tell the world please, please don't judge me
Will somebody please, please double cup me?
And everybody please, please don't judge me
You sit on 24's, we sip on 24's
You sit on 24's, we, we, we
Drop a four in the 20 ounce and call it 24's
Drop a four in the 20 ounce and call it 24's
Yeah, I'm in the lab, no pad, no pen
Just a styrofoam cup I can pour a four in",https://genius.com/Lil-wayne-me-and-my-drank-lyrics
Cannon,Dedication 2,2006.0,"Howdy do motherfuckas, it's Weezy Baby
Niggas bitchin' and I gotta tote the (Cannon)
Listen close, I got duct tape and rope
I leave you missing like the fucking O'bannons
One hand on my money, one hand on my buddy
That's the AK-47, make his neighborhood love me
Bullets like birds, you can hear them bitches humming
Don't make that bird shit, he got a weak stomach
Niggas know I'm sick, I don't spit, I vomit, got it?
One egg short of the omelet
Simon says: ""shoot a nigga in his thigh and leg""
And tell him ""catch up"" like mayonnaise
Um, I'm the sickest nigga doing it, bet that baby
These other niggas dope, I'm wet crack baby
Yes, get back, get back boy, this a setback
Clumsy ass niggas slip and fall into a debt trap
Them boys pussy, born without a backbone
And if you strapped we can trade like the Dow Jones
Wet em up, I hope he got his towel on
I aim at your moon and get my howl on
Some niggas cry wolf, I'm on that dry kush
And when it come to that paper I stack books
You heard what I said
I can put you on your feet or put some money on ya head
Life ain't cheap, you better off dead if you can't pay the fee
Shout out my nigga Fee
See every motherfucka at the door don't get a key
You're outside looking in, so tell me what you see
It's about money, it's bigger than me
I tell my homies: ""don't kill him, bring the nigga to me""
Yeah, don't miss, you fucking with the hitman
Kidnap a nigga, make him feel like a kid again

Straight up, I ain't got no conversation for you

You trolley, get bodied, keep nina and shotty in the whip
If a nigga try to stick me I'mma blam him
Sing along now, di-di-dadi, I'm Free, got the butters
Got the green, he got the tan, got the whole enchilada
Owe me dough, I'm inside of ya house, tie up ya brother
Make the prick call up ya mother, she might know where to find you
I am on top of my job, the heavyweight champ of the flowers
Flow like the ocean, open water, ya drowning, I will
Four-pound him and sink him, heat him, then leave him stinking
Sharks surround him and eat him, nice to know him, I will
Roll over your squad like I'm ""One Punch"" Carr
You chumps, you best call General Motors, I will
Take control of your soldiers, you won't miss 'em
'Til I toss em in the wok like chicken, General Tso, uh-oh!

I make it hard for rap niggas, I'm peer pressure
Matter of fact I'm motivation to rap better
I showed niggas how to act, how to dress better
I stay fresh, more fitted caps than bad catchers
I'm the crack, the smack, the gun, the rule
The gat, the strap, the gun, the tool
The motherfucking (Cannon)
Other words, I'm the real, for real
We can go check for check or bill for bill
We can go chick for chick or skill for skill
The deal is sealed, niggas ain't real as Will, 'cause I'm a (Cannon)
And I handle well, pedal like Cannondale
And I got the 50-cal mag, its a handheld (Cannon)
I'm telling you niggas, I pop, put a shell in you niggas
My nice watch'll Helen Keller you niggas
I got whores in the Canon camcorder bendin' over
Blowing 'ghan by the quarter, weed odor in the Rover, nigga

Detroit Red gettin' change like them white folks
Dump it out the window of the Range with the rifle
Pain like a bitch like the first day of a cycle
You better scurry when I pull the (Cannon)
Tracks burn the streets like a truck do the gas
I love head and caressing a voluptuous ass
I ask ya baby mama is she up to the task
She like ""Damn Red, it's bigger than (Cannon)""
My attire makes the ladies say ya man is too fly
Imported oils from Iran and Dubai
Get caught slipping with ya mans and you die
Where I'm from niggas be quick to squeeze the (Cannon)
Detroit Red always got some shit for ya ear
Show me love but keep it moving man, cause if you get near
I'll say, get off my dick and tell ya bitch to come here
'Cause you sweating me and my DJ Don (Cannon)

Legs spread far out, you know how I'm standing
Yeah I'm posted with the big homie (Cannon)
I got niggas who don't like rap lovin' our shit
We got niggas who was stuck on Pac bumpin' our shit
These niggas can't see me like I ain't been around lately
A good batter when they at the mound its gravy
Niggas salty, I'm pepper, no Spinderella
Just a cigarillo, filled with Tropicana
Yeah, Vic found that lick now we not smoking no more regular
Keep ya mid-grade, I don't think you know no better
They love ""In Da Trunk"", now they wanna hear more shit
I play it modest like ""nigga that's some of our old shit,""
Got niggas I ain't never met wanting to fight me
Got hoes that's in love asking ""why you don't like me""?
Bitch I'm married to the game and I love my wifey
Steppin' over competition, man I love these Nikes
Yeah, I'm hot, they fanning
Niggas try to copy my style like the Canon
Don't try to compare I'm in a league of my own
If I ain't listed at the top, nigga the stats is wrong
All the data is off, ya info ain't valid
Artist of the century the competition ain't balanced

Lock the CEO up, and I'm the CEO, fuck
Prison in February, and I ain't in no rush

Ball so hard, man, I gotta go pro once
Hit 'em with the shotgun, call that shit the stop button

Flowers for the dead, here's a bouquet
L.V.'s, nigga, on every suitcase
Y.M., nigga, it's a new day
We the champions, nigga, hoo-ray
Yeah, hammer in the Louis duff
Take a nigga bitch, she gave me brains until I knew enough
Bullet come too fast to adjust
I don't give a fuck about my roof that much
So I put it in the trunk and then the coupe sped up
Take the chopper out the trunk and just shoot that up
I'm Weezy F and the 'F' is for Flame
Eat these rappers, chef of the game
Shit on the track, shit on the train
Murder the beat, the beat was slain
Rest in peace, that's a shame, he kill anybody's song
Versatile as fuck, I switch it up like Dennis Rodman's dome
No homo, you rockin' wrong, rest in peace my styrofoam
Now they wanna know what I be on
Get the fuck off my dick, my cock, my bone
Big money, my pockets long
New Orleans, I got my home
And they got my back, pause; no homo, no maricón
Smoking on that private grown, it put me where I belong
All about my cheese; cheddar, mozzarella, provolone
Fuck her for an hour long, let her take a shower, gone
Sorry baby, but I'm in my I-don't-wanna-be-bothered zone
Yeah, you're a groupie, get on your duty
Two women give me head, call that ""Two-face""
Bitch I'm too great, take your food tray, I was born on doomsday
Ain't no nigga like me
""What's up"" to my gang, big B's like a Breitling
Take a nigga bitch, she ride my dick like she cycling
Then she can't walk, run, or jump, like white men
Fuck you niggas wanna do?
No Ceilings, let the bullets rain on you

I gotta bitch named Keisha she a real dick pleaser

But shawty from Cuba, still workin' on her visa
Her girlfriend Lisa, met her in Puerto Rico
How she don't suck dick, but expectin' me to eat her?
That ho crazy, man, you don't wanna meet her
But her homegirl Nita swallow cum by the liter
She look good in boy shorts and a beater
But this other girl Quita way sexier than Nita
I ain't lyin she the, hottest bitch, heater
But I'm a fuckin' freezer, yea, I'mma fuckin' leave her
Yeah, I'm a fuckin' eagle, flyer and deeper
Smoke like a Cohiba, your ho give me cerebral
Now get low and touch your toes for my people
And if you ain't fuckin' them, then you ain't fuckin' me either
You think your man hot? Well, fuck it, me ether
Heard I got guap, wanna kick it like FIFA
Every day Christmas, cause I'm smokin' that wreath-a (reefer)
Keep a lot of bitches like Queen Latifah
I am southern-land, not Kiefer
Y-M-E for Young Money Entertainment, ha
Run, dummy, finna bang it
You want beef? Then my money will arrange it
I am not fuckin' finna aim it
But that Nina Ross shout for me when I'm angry

Sloppy like Joe, you better go get G.I
All my guns knee high, M-O-N-E-Y
Thats what I rely on, I'm gone
He high, yep, I'm three-high
Im just schoolin' these fucks like DeVry
College institution, finals and confusion
Stop with your excuses, hip-hop, I am seducin'
Beat ya like producers, eat you like produce
Man I'll fuck your girl till her pussy got no juice
Now she can't produce, so you won't be needin' that baby
Cause all you really need is Weezy F. Baby

Alright let me vent for a minute
See, the problem I got with the game is
There are no gatekeepers in hip hop
Who is letting these wack niggas in?
I mean, can someone please put a combination lock on the door
And stop giving out the code?
God damn! Hey, Millz, show 'em how it's done

I knew this freak named Tammy from around the way
She used to go to Catholic school back in the day
Now she strippin' in Sue's for a stack a day
But she bring it all to Daddy, so that's okay
I got bitch named Lola, true dick-smoker
Part-time broker late nights, she work at Strokers
Her cousin named Mocha, got a insane spine
But it's crazy 'cause I fucked 'em both at the same time
I even got a bitch in the bay named Jessica
I swear, she might give the best mouth in America
Vanessa got a attitude, but her ass meaner
She remind me of this ho I used to fuck named Sabrina
Ugly little thing, from the home of the Ravens
I only kept around 'cause her ass was amazing
Tiffany and Emily, my bonafide sluts
When I cum, they touch tongues and share that nut
Got a white chick down in Florida named Sasha
On my momma, her head golden like an Oscar
And I met her through Tasha
At the condo she let me fuck her on the washer
September nigga, so you know he nasty
And if she nasty, we do the nasty
Now, I tell a bitch like this
You gotta take 10 dicks before you meet the president
Young Money!

I know this one honey
I call her track star, cause when we fuck she run from me
And I'm hella fly, and her dude dumb-bummy
And I don't get girls, I make her get one for me
My weed real plummy, and real gummy
And my flow is harder than an anvil, honey
Shoot these niggas with the handheld, honey
I paper chase, fuck standstill money
Niggas kill with me and kill for me
Best believe we ridin' if the fan belt runnin'
Leave a mothafucker just layin' there bloody
I'm from the dirty and I make it rain, damn, that's muddy
She just wanna be my cuddy buddy
And on these tracks I go nutty-butty

So I guess I gotta work with the little bit I got
Now I'm like ""Hey, I like the view from here!""
I'm so high I can't see you from here
Both eyes on the money, it's looking back at me
Man, these bitches just looking for a daddy
Pussy and problems, can't live without 'em
The weed too loud, turn up the volume
Richer than a bitch, but I can't buy tomorrow
That's why I go hard, ho

God bless the world, and most people in it
It's anybody's game, but nobody's winning
Mona Lisa smile, that bitch barely grinning
Take you off the face of the Earth like a blemish
We went from Boyz to Menace, Menace II Society
Now we get higher, call that shit karate
Blame it on the money, the money is the bad guy
Smoke so much good, I don't even have a bad side
Yeah, I got a pussy hangover
Bitches eat me up like my name is Russell Stover
Murder the perception, make 'em get it right
If I'm flirting with perfection, I'm fucking her tonight
I'm a Southerner's delight, Louisiana pride
The belly of the beast, it ate me alive
Tell them bitches they'll never take me alive

That's why I go hard, ho

Uh, and we all kiss our mamas
Cause promises are broken but tomorrow isn't promised
Think I'm gettin' sick, I'm feelin' illegal
And not having money is the root of all evil
Life is a midget, so try to live it up
It's Dr. Carter, bitch, I got this shit nipped and tucked
If these walls could talk, they probably won't shut up
I need some wallpaper before they start to fuss
Yeah, pick up the phone and call your bluff
Human growth hormone, now my pockets all buff
I don't think about the future, it comes soon enough
Motherfucker, I don't shoot ya; bitch, I shoot ya up
I ain't like these niggas, I don't like these niggas
I just roll another joint, like Spike Lee, nigga
And I woke up this morning, got the coal out my eyes
And then I took a walk outside and...

Gas to the floor, I'm pressin' fast forward, I race a NASCAR
Transport just what you asked for
Don't ask me what I asked for if you can't answer
Now who them Xans for?
I'll pop DANs for muscle relaxation, I'm a patient
Pick up the pace when I feel too adjacent to who I'm racing
Yeah, I'm spacin', I'm spacin' out
Oh, you faded? I'm faded out
Oh, you made it? I made it out
But you shady like 8 Mile
8 Ball from Orange Mound, letdown, I lay her down
Like an eagle, she spread it out, ate it out, yeah, I ate it out
I'm a Libra, I weigh it out
Hope the reaper don't take me out
I'm too eager to wait it out
Stuck the heater in Satan's mouth
Pray polices don't raid the house
Pay my taxes and baby moms
Ain't no cappin', don't play around
Hate me back then, they hate me now
In my lap is your face, I got napkins to waste
I got mansions with gates, feel like I'm NASA with space
Don't feel like answerin' my phone, I feel like thrashin' today
I put my ratchet on safe, and I feel actually safe
Catchin' spasms and aches, from all the hands I done shaked
And all the cash I done counted and all the blunts I done rolled up
I stunt when I rolled up
With a bad bitch sittin' in the front with her nose up
You know what's in my soda
And your trap house closin', your glass house broken
And my madhouse open and my lighthouse glowin'

Mahogany dashboard, do the dash, boy
Mahogany dashboard, do the dash, boy
Mahogany handle on the gun in my hand, boy
Brains all over my mahogany dashboard

Mahogany dashboard, I do the dash, boy
I think in my backyard, I need an airport
Mahogany sand, boy, I start a sand storm
Mahogany skin, touch me, I cut your hands off
Mahogany door handle to match the floor panel
Mahogany sand, mahogany Dior sandals
Mahogany dash, slime, I do the dash, slime
Sit the coke on the glass, slime, she snort a flat line
Good times, no hard times, uh-oh, it's that time
We at war, I check my Chopard for the exact time
Bang, bang, brrat time, I'm reppin' Fab Five
Flag high, red, red, red, bloody vampire
Plug was a fucking Arabi, it's no cap, slime
Judge gave me time, I did that time like nap time
Mahogany skateboard, I parked the Wraith for it
I kick, push straight forward, I hear Lupe flowin'
Under the skully, these bright mahogany dreads showin'
Let's get in bed and break these mahogany headboards
Oh, woah, mahogany, yeah, woah

And fly with the tongue, so if you feeling froggy, leap (c'mon)

Don't get murdered over your song before you ad-lib it

Not to put no fucking fish tanks in your Civic
Fuck getting your ride pimped, you'll get hog-tied, wimp
Have you in the trunk curled up like fried shrimp
It's been a good year, maybe I should ride blimp
Cause your boy just stay above the game
They tryna tag him, spray a brother frame
But your shots can't reach me, I'm way above your aim
Go 'head, nigga, say another name
Take this family for a joke, play them Wayan brother games
And I'ma Git You Sucka, I be schemin' with this Keenan
Aimin with this Damon, I'm putting that Major Payne in

For Nothing,Dedication 6: Reloaded,2018.0,"[Intro: DJ Drama & 
Lil Wayne
]
Gangster, gangster
DatPiff dot com, world premiere
Okay
Yeah
I'm reloaded (gangster grizzils)
Trill outchea
So after D6, I text Weezy
It's rough
I say, now it's time for a vacation
Guess the iPhone autocorrected
And he thought I said ""now it's time for a Dedication.""
Now you want it?  'Cause we gon' bring it y'all
So now y'all got a twenty pack
What's your address?
You're welcome
And not your email address neither
D6: Reloaded
Front door, leggo
A Dedication!

Looking in the mirror, all I see is money
Bop-bop,
 but if I was blind, all I hear is runnin'
Plug went to jail Saturday, 'posed to meet him Sunday
He said his bitch flushed the work, time to do some plumbin'
Gotta love the way we comin' though, we keep it comin'
Wolves never cry wolf and you could feed us onions
Pledge allegiance to the region that's beneath and under
The southside from your blind side, Stevie Wonder
Hunger Games, ain't no games when we speakin' hunger
We greedy fuckers, eat your supper, pick our teeth, and mug you
The pockets bustin' out the muscle, bitch, I'm bleedin' blubber
And I been drunk and I can't trust you 'cause I'm seein' double
And I been ballin' like the Rucker, nigga, triple-double
And now it's war, and they want peace, but it won't fix the puzzle
You drop the ball, if you a beast you won't be quick to fumble
If I'm too deep then get a bigger shovel, dig a tunnel
If you a beast then that bitch can't get a nickel from you
I'm the only one that speak when we in the huddle
Make a pussy nigga leak, then jump in the puddle
We comin' deep to your street, 'bout to rent a shuttle
Every day of the week, if I hit the streets, I gotta hit a hustle
Every day of the week I gotta get loaded-loaded, skip the bufferin'
I got it made, and with that said, I gotta tip the butler
I like my bitches mustard, business hushed, and Bentleys custom
Bitches sufferin' 'cause the system fucked 'em, now they fuckin'
They can't hide their battle scars but they can hide their stomachs
Niggas like Niagara Falls how their mouths are runnin'
But we making caviar out of flounders, guppies
Stand tall, but I'm a munchkin to my pile of money
Got down and dug it, found a nugget, made a mountain of it
Don't need a crown, gown, or nothing; I'm the king of subject
Chocolate, brown, cream, and fudgie, and I'm peanut buttery
Fuck the fuckery, I go skullduggery, it get ugly
Niggas thuggin', we got babies smugglin' in their Huggies
Niggas jugglin' different kind of drugs, Feds strugglin'
Sippin' Actavis, activist like Fred Douglass
Goodnight, sleep tight, watch the bed buggies
She give me ass, she give me head, I call it head-buttin'
Walk in a room full of buttons, press the red button
Blow this bitch to shreds, get my skateboard and shred somethin'
Lead pumpin', you dead, pumpkin
Go 'head, dump 'em, redrum 'em
Goin' hard in the paint, Andre Drummond
Headhuntin', Good Will Huntin', still stuntin'
All or nothin', Warren G to Warren Buffett
Stormin', floodin', lightnin', thunderin'
Carter comin', like karma comin'
My bitch pussy's the warmest oven
Need morning lovin'
She foreign, Donald might bomb her country
Thick as fuck, no panties when she got on her onesie
Whoa
Time to get this paper though
You ape or ho?
Bitches in line to get this snake fo' sho'
We take the dough
If they don't pay the dough, and that's fo' sho'
We make 'em vegetables, and we don't even like vegetables
These niggas extra broke, we break a nigga down to decimals
We up in México to see the plug, and not electrical
High cholesterol, you niggas salty, I'm the pepper though
Your bitch ain't half a ho, she wanna be in my next episode
I'm a steppin' stone
And that .380, that's my chaperone
It blow like saxophone
And when the smoke clear I'ma stand alone
I'm from the terrordome
Yeah, that's New Orleans, home of methadone
Cops on megaphones
It's so much bad luck, ain't no leprechauns
I been called a stone, pocket full of stones
On the corner moving stones, Papa was a rolling stone
I'm so stoned, in this bitch, waitin' on Babylon
Bible on the dresser, next to the gun and Tylenol, silence off
Spike a bitch drink, like volleyball
Olive Oyl skinny bitches can't get in the ride at all
Not at all
I'm involved in a real private war, time to brawl
Niggas don't want Lil Tune to take these diamonds off
I'ma talk crazy to a deaf nigga, these niggas blind
I'ma still throw up my set, nigga, steel toe in your chest, nigga
""Hell no"" to a yes-nigga, ""Fuckin' right"" to a bad bitch
She can fuck around and get her ass licked
Still can't get her ass kissed
Black fist, middle finger to taxes, the police and their actions
I'm still pickin' out mansions
Still dickin' down such-and-such, still fuckin' with so-and-so
Still fuckin' my bitch's friends, never fuck my woadie ho
Still talkin' about Hollygrove, still talkin' about coke and dope
On the set in that OVO, on the jet in that OVO
I don't threaten, I go for broke, wanna step and go toe to toe?
No bullshit at this rodeo, and all my clips Pinocchio
Tunechi, bitch, for nothing, drops mic

Well, I can't technically 'cause it's connected
But, but, you get the expression, Mula
Welcome, thank you for joining
Dedication 6
, this some sick shit
Umm, first of all, I wanna thank Drama for doing this shit again, and always doing this shit for his dawg. My nigga, one time. Thank everybody involved, everybody involved. My team, my team is my fam. Everybody who put they fingerprints on this shit, 'preciate everybody
So the definition of 
Dedication
 has changed for me since the first one, since the second one, since the third one, whatever. It's because, umm, whenever I put it out, umm, it's life.
 
And since I don't write none of my shit, I'm coming from the head.
 
And what happens is, when you rap so long or when you do it so long, all the things in your head, you done used up. So what happens is you gotta start using something else and coming from somewhere else, and that somewhere else is ten times out of ten your heart. And, umm, that's what this 
Dedication 6
 project is
But, uh, yeah, the definition is always different because I'm always going through something at that time of my life, you know what I mean. I prolly was fucking your bitch on 
Dedication 4
, and the whole fucking shit was dedicated to her, you know what I mean. I dunno. Whichever one that wasn't, that didn't do as well as all of the rest of them, that was definitely the one that was dedicated to her",https://genius.com/Lil-wayne-for-nothing-lyrics

I go hard for my baby
Psycho ward for my baby
Swipe that card for my baby
Bodyguard for my baby
Bobby Brown for my baby
Lock it down for my baby
I knock that pussy out and then I growl for my baby
Even psychos need love too
I save all her text messages
I smell her panties while she in the bathroom
And taste whatever she left in them
I take pictures of her when she not lookin'
Study 'em microscopically
Marry me and then bury me

It's all about the Young fuckin' Money
It's a war in these streets, I need a Humvee
That AK-47, that's my trusty

Another one bites the dust 'til his gums bleed

Me with no money's like a bunny with no front teeth
Fuck me? It's fuck you if it's fuck me
I hit the kush, blow it out like a bum knee
Where the haters? Point 'em out and ask 'em what's beef
Stack of hundred dollar bills in a scrunchie
Oh Lord, kamikaze, kidnappin' killers
Screaming ""Fuck the other side!""
She ride the dick, the dick gon' kill her, vehicular homicide
Oh Lord, 
I'm Sorry 4 The Wait, nigga
I'm sorry for them other guys
Lay a nigga down, Nina sang his ass a lullaby
Wave your white flag all you want, bitch, I'm colorblind
Bad bitch with me got thunder thighs and her mother's eyes
Li-li-li-lick my lollipop like it got gum inside
Miami in the winter, Cali in the summertime
My bitch is independent, she don't ask me for a dime
Love it when we makin' love, hate it when it's fuckin' time
Disrespect the caterpillar, rave about the butterfly
Bullet ain't got no name, nigga, but you could get it customized
Run up in your house, undisguised, why you look surprised?
Motherfuckers better fuckin' hide, I feel like Mr. Hyde
Athletes still gettin' jacked like they missin' tires
Oh Lord, one of the wildest B's in my hive
I'll sting a bitch and die anytime
Hate it when the fuckin' police shut the session down
We just talkin', we just skatin', we just messin' round
Tell them niggas that be hatin' we ain't messin' round
They just barkin', they just fakin', they gon' settle down
We got bitches, we got beer, we got Bobby Brown
Skatin' underneath the bridge, dead body found
Do a trick over the body, hope he smilin' down
Do a trick off of some stairs, land on solid ground
Grizzly Gang in this bitch, check the grip tape
Nigga came on your bitch, ooh milkshake
Chop a cocaine brick like a sensei
Break the great white down to a fish plate
Woo! Pockets on inflate
Got the Yay locked down like Kim K
I been sippin' codeine since 10K
I be cussin' while I'm bustin', ""Die motherfuckers""

Straight to the money, no short cuts

Goons in this bitch, leave a nigga on a stretcher
It's all there papa, you ain't even got to measure
Laughing at how my old bitches look jealous
Well what goes around comes around, propellers
Money Over Bitches, M.O.B, goodfellas
Cut our ears off, ain't shit you could tell us
Write your name on the bullet, that's a fuckin' love letter
If I ain't a trendin' topic, I'm a fuckin' trend-setter, I'm on

chasin' a leopard

I ain't on that bullshit, shorty fine as fuck though
Now she kiss me on my neck, I hope she ain't cut-throat
Cut down on the syrup cause it made me fuck slow
Shoot so many times I'mma choke off the gunsmoke

I cock back and aim at your membrane
Broad day, no mask, close range

I should probably do better but probably, whatever

Your bullshit is stinkin' up the place
Me no tek bad up, me a done de place
Can't let these bitch niggas slide and touch base
I make her cum so many times, call her ""nutcase""
It's Young Money baby, take your clothes off
Give me them three holes, bowlin' ball

Keep them bitches cummin' and she gon' do whatever

And taped up my heart and wiped off my eyes
Without you, without you

How you doing? I can tell, yeah
How you doing? I can tell
You look like yourself
I'm by myself",https://genius.com/Lil-wayne-without-you-lyrics

Fuq' got the weed,

They say numbers don't lie; bitch, I'm not the one
Hammers in your face, this is not a dream
And you're getting every page of this magazine
Bumping UGK, talking about a murder
We roll a Dr. J and then we light that Julius Erving
I got pussy on the way and pussy on the way out
Life is a beach and these hoes trying to lay out
Tunechi, Tunechi, tote the toolie, fuck around and pop ya
My homies got that white girl, call it Lady Gaga!
Glock 4-tini, nina colada
Suck, swallow; semen, saliva
I am going at your collar; fuck you hoe niggas

Diamonds in my teeth like I'm a fucking dope dealer

Back where I started on my set, in black
All chrome Glock looking like a platinum plaque
We don't pack extra clips, we pack extra Gats
And all my hoes dirty like welcome mats
'Til the wheels fall off; I can fix a flat
If you're scared, go to church and get a scripture tat
Guns the size of children; now, don't be childish
Be with wild-ass niggas, and I am the wildest
I'm a motherfucker; call me Weezy, baby
And on the end of the barrel, I got a sweet potato
My life is a movie, I got a leading lady
My rooftop drop back like Tom Brady
I got the world in my hands, skateboard and my Vans
And all my boys stay strapped like we live in Iran
I know what I can do, so, bitch, I do what I can
Dropped that Sorry 4 the Wait, man, I'm just saying

Living Right,FWA,2015.0,"Livin'

Nigga, that's me in that nice-ass house
Butt-naked bitch with a nice ass
Walkin' 'round saying, ""You got a nice-ass house""
My phone keep ringin' though, my bad
I think my girl got me on spy cam now
My homies call cocaine ""white trash""
Charge you double just to take my trash out
I cannot fuck wit' you, bitch, 'cause you gon' get a nigga busted
Worryin' 'bout the wrong things while I'm hustlin'
Put the dick up in your mouth while it's runnin'
Bitch, don't ask no questions
Soon as I heard this, a young nigga killed it
'Cause I go too hard, I eat beats, mmm, scrumptious, delicious
Shoot you in your kidneys
I hope you see blood when you pissin'
We run up in your house on Christmas
And don't ask no questions
Just shoot whoever's present
While they open their presents
Oh please, Lord, forgive me
I just talked to my Reverend
Asked him if I'm the Devil
He said, ""That's these bitches""
See, I'm from New Orleans, that bitch is infested
Shootouts like the Westerns
Kill you and your bestie
Pay niggas to do it correctly
Two Ninas, they lesbians
I gotta shoot you with both or else one'd get jealous
I make money, not exceptions
Take pills like breath mints
She just get dick and refreshments
Free all my dogs in corrections
We all we got, don't need extras
We don't expect shit
We don't get mad over pussy
I'm probably lyin' in some pussy
While fools out here dyin' over pussy
And that's what I don't understand

'Cause a young nigga livin' right
A young nigga livin' right (Livin')
Yeah, a young nigga livin' right
A young nigga livin' right, mmm (You see me)
Don't get me wrong, I had to get it right
But now a young nigga livin' right, yeah (Livin')
Bitches see me and start gettin' right
Because they know a nigga livin' right (You see me)

Standin' on the top, I got a
Lot of observations
Young nigga, lot of options
You, you
Runnin' through a check
Buyin' all the champagne, blowin' up the net
And settin' all the trends, showin' niggas what's next
I was drinkin' coffee, smokin' weed on the jet
Probably wit' your wifey in the back for pillow talk
But we ain’t talkin', gettin' top while ain't no top
Swear to God, I had a chopper
Now the gun biz are the friends hoppin' out a helicopter
I be rollin' up the doctor's wishes
Countin' up the money, kickin' out the bitches
'Cause they all up on you, but be gone when it get real
Bitches ain't shit but a brick through your windshield
Shows in the evening, business meetings in the morning
(Ho)
Goons on deck, don't make a nigga sick 'em on ya
(Go, go, go)
Niggas talkin' shit, gon' make a nigga get pneumonia
Wrist so cold, think it's sick and got Ebola
Crib so big, got a bitch in every corner
Joint smoke good 'cause I showed her how to roll it
In the morning, I got meetings with my lawyer
Arguments I'll never be a part of
Love pussy and some good conversation
And that money, we'll never see a shortage
Nigga run up on me, he gon' be a goner
Bruce Wayne whip, I got a new favorite bitch
I got a joint I just rolled that got a Liu Kang kick
I gotta do it big, that's just how I do things

Uh, 'cause a young nigga livin' right
A young nigga livin' right (Young nigga)
A young nigga livin' right
A young nigga livin' right, yeah (You see me)
Don't get me wrong, I had to get it right
But now a young nigga livin' right, yeah (Livin')
Bitches see me and start gettin' right
Because they know a nigga livin' right, uh (You see me)

My homie got the pistol and he might spazz out
Lifespan, motherfuckin' lifespan
That shit all depend on how tonight pan out
Ooh, I swear these hoes ain't right man
I left my shady bitch, I got a nice tan now
Red bandana in my right pocket
So if I pull the trigger, I can wipe that down
I just put my gun up in her Coach bag
I won't hesitate to pull it right back out
Life coach? I don't need no life coach
To coach me through my motherfuckin' ups and downs
Tell a bitch don't ask no questions
My money so old, I tell my new money ""Respect your elders""
I'm startin' to get jealous of my own reflection
The young nigga sexy, a young nigga healthy
A young nigga flexin', I'm countin' my blessings
""Achoo,"" ""God bless me,"" ""Thank you,"" ""You're welcome""
I talked to my Reverend, asked him if there’s a Heaven
A Heaven for a G, because me and my Gangstas
Done done it all, but never tell
He say ""We already in Hell,"" I say ""Ain't that a bitch?""
'Cause I work too hard, but still thankful as if this shit came as a gift
I just pray for my niggas that's out here still slangin' that shit
Keep my distance, I can't take that risk
I hope they understand

'Cause a young nigga livin' right
A young nigga livin' right (Livin')
Yeah, a young nigga livin' right
A young nigga livin' right, mmm (You see me)
Don’t get me wrong, I had to get it right

No brake lights on my car rear

I rap like I done died and gone to heaven, I swear
And yeah, I'm a bear, like black and white hair, so I'm polar
And they can't get on my system 'cause my system is the solar
I am so far from the othars, I meant others
I just eat them for supper, get in my spaceship and hover, hover

Try Me,Sorry 4 the Wait 2,2015.0,"Okay I'ma throw a tantrum on this beat
Now who wanna play fetch?
When it comes to the drugs, boy we shop at Payless
Shawty came too many times, left the whole bed wet
Mack the thinker, I'm the Blood - Method Man, Redman
A scared man a dead man, can I get a amen
You done bought all of them guns and ain't nobody dead yet
Catch your pussy ass in traffic, aim at the headrest
Got your bitch on her knees lookin' like she legless
Like I can't trust my iPhone, I can't trust the clique I ride for
If I see 'em in the streets I'ma have to treat 'em like a rival
I'm a pleasure to your eyeballs
I'm so fly I shop at Skymall
Mama never bought me knockoffs
Lord I need some wood to knock on
Lil Tunechi, I'm a movie, get your gummy bears and popcorn
I got somethin' very hot on my hip, I get my hip hop on
And this little red dot gon' help me hit a nigga spot on
Point guard with the bullets; you say Rájon, I say Rajon
Yeah, hold up; we them boys, we them wild boys
I hold a pistol sideways when I shoot, that's for style points
Menace to society, menace to myself though
Bend but don't break, my niggas call me elbow
And you don't want no problem, I'm a problem
My AK just keep shootin', it's on autopilot
Tunechi what's your fuckin' problem? I got fuckin' problems
Bad bitch on top of me, she started from the bottom
On that Cognac and that loud pack, that loud pack
You gotta shoot the rat when it get too big for the mousetrap
Shoot at me and I'ma smile back and then I'll ""Pow"" back
Flip you over like a kayak, bitch it's combat
Bitch I'm Tommy Gun Tunechi
Favorite color ruby
Made enough to quit but I keep makin' up excuses
Triple A dick, that's Amazin' And Amusin'
I'm sedated and secluded
I'm the greatest and improvin'
But my baby mama say I'm livin' wrong
Well if I die then I guess she dead right
Catch me walkin' on this mothafuckin' water, nigga
I'll catch your pussy ass at a red light
And you gon' hear that blocka, that blocka
I represent my killers like Johnnie Cochran
We kidnap mamas and toddlers
We don't give a fuck if they ass adopted
Brief moment of silence for Chris Wallace
Soulja Slim, Pac, Pimp C, I hope they smilin'
And Weezy still hot as tamales
My private plane got that wi-fi and that wireless
I'm so sorry for the wait

Spread your legs, girl, I'm tryna break the headboard
I'm a fiend for the bread, I want the whole Dej Loaf
My Chinese chick just want a blunt and some yaka mein
She a squirter so we don't fuck on my Versace sheets
My whole crew'll skate on you like a hockey team
It's like Wayne Gretzky meets Jeremy Shockey
We Young Money Mafia, I rep what I rep
Try to throw salt on my name and I'll put pep in your step
Put your gloves on, nigga please get you a grip
And I bet you rest in peace when I let this bitch rip
The money runnin' like water, check the cash flow
My weed funky like armpits and assholes
Potato on the nine, when we creep we mash slow
And make sure them kids get everything they ask for
My bitch in London said she's a Mack Mainiac
And her sister love Tune, she a Wayniac
It's like she's two different persons; she be chillin', she be cursin'
Cry a river, squirt a ocean
Fuck fast, in slow motion
Man I know Soulja proud of me (ya heard me?)
Man, I know Soulja Slim proud of me (ya heard me?)
Tha Carter 5 a classic, sorry that it's late
And I ain't apologetic, but, sorry for the wait

Together we stand, and fall on y'all
Balling with my Bloods, call it B-ball
These dames ain't shit, Young Money is
I got Mars bars, 3 Musketeers
Come through, coupe same color as veneers
And you know I'm riding with the toast, cheers

Father forgive me for my brash delivery
I-I-I would try you, I wouldn't lie dude
I must be sticky cause them bitches got their eyes glued

Strong-arm rap like a nigga did a hundred curls
Rockstar biatch, check out how we rock
And if this ain't hip-hop, it must be knee-hop
I'm higher than a tree top, she lick my lollipop
I still get my candy from your girlfriend's sweet shop
Spitting that heat rock, I'm smooth, not Pete Rock
And my, and my money on et cetera, three dots
Still get a stomach ache every time I see cops
You better run motherfucker, cause we not
You better run 'til your feet stop
You ain't even a fucking alphabet in my teapot
Colder than a ski shop, holding on to the top

Bed sheets so nice, bed bugs don't bite
I ask her do she wanna fuck, before I ask twice, she say
Yes I am a beast, I swear I needs to be tranquilized
Yes I am a giant, next to me you are just ankle high
Yes I eat that pussy, oh, how do I love that panty pie

I’m at peace, joggin' pants cost at least about a grand
I'm advanced like Japan
Got more sand than Sudan, Lord

And life ain't nothin' but a long day
And tomorrow ain't nothin' but a long way away
You know that haters come in all sizes, all shapes, 'kay
That's why I had to get a little more trunk space
Got insurance on the trap house, Allstate
Got the trap house pumpin' like a heart rate
Got the trap house pumpin' like a 808
Boom, like a 808

I could fly around that bitch, need a tarmac
I just landed in Cuba, need a straw hat
I gotta get the raw back, I need a format
I put the shit on horseback and start my own ranch
From where they don't talk smack, they just snort smack
I'll turn your head to an open hot sauce pack
I tell the bitch some true lies and some false facts
Boy, I'm drownin' in the syrup like a short stack
Ooh, 187, 211
Hockey mask on, Wayne Gretzky
Stunt my ass off, chain heavy
Your bitch get passed on, chain letter
Train smoker, smoke plain, never
Had a date with the Devil
Then I changed schedules
I'm a trained killer
Like a paid killer
Better yet, Saddam Hussein nephew
Nigga, no love
That's from the bottom of my heart
I pull up and paint your whole fucking block red
Then get out of my car and admire my art
Then smile at my thoughts
My bitch from Atlanta got eyes like a hawk
She see why I'm a boss
I just got another speeding ticket on the Bugatti
While it was parked
Now I don't wan' talk, bitch, I don't wan' talk
Lean in my punch,
 I decided to spar
Anybody want war?
I'm excited to start
Get indicted tomorrow
I be out by the morn
Before I even yawn
Stay in ya lane, I remind these lil' boys
This is victory lane, now do I need a horn?
The struggle is real, and the Bible too long
I'm writing my will, and I'm typing my won'ts
Lord, please
Kilos, OZ's
'Cause my bitch high class, she like Pinot and cheese
I dropped out of class so I'm zero degrees
I can out-think a shrink, she can deep throat a tree
I can hijack a Brinks, 
so my sweet soda pink
I'm a freak show to freaks
I'm spitting these bars, hope my bar tab is cheap
I'm a hard man to reach
I'm newborn and deceased
I'm too hard for this beat
I'm the heart and the beat
The Chong and the Cheech
My blunt long as a speech
Roach look like a leech
I'm too long for the brief
I'm too wrong for the priest
With this chrome on your teeth
That get blown out your cheek
Like my bitch mixed, like Long Island Tea
She don't hide her figure, she don't hide her feet
I'm the head nigga, like Prodigy
And bitch, I'ma shine, like Connery
Yeah

And life ain't nothin' but a long day
Tomorrow ain't nothin' but a long way, away",https://genius.com/Lil-wayne-street-chains-lyrics

So I'mma do this shit
No Ceilings!
Yeah, hahah
I'mma run this town tonight
Alright now

Nigga, we are so ready for the war
C-A-R-T-E-R, put the beat in ER
I'm colder than B-R, add another three Rs
Watch me like DVD/VCR
Pump to your chest, I ain't talking CPR
Riding this track like a motherfucking street car
New Orleans coroner, his name is Frank Minyard
Fuck with me wrong, you’ll be waking up in his yard
Man, I go crazy on the beat, I go Nimrod
Man, I act a ass, treat the beat like a hemorrhoid
Man, I go to work on the beat, call it employed
Man, I kicks it, bitch, get your shin guard
Young Money run this, towns, countries
I still eat rappers; mmm, scrumptious
My goons tote thumpers, they pump 'em like krumpers
Anybody beat, I'm gon' go Archie bonkers
Tunechi be the wildest, let's run the metropolis
I pop like lollies, you drop like eyelids
The money keep calling, I hear the shit dialing
And they say money talks, you can hear my shit hollering
You softer than ny-lin; oops, I meant nylon
Perfection is the goal and I’m headed to the pylon
Crown fit me good, I ain’t even got to try on
The pistol mean business, that bitch should have a tie on
T done told me do this shit, so I had to do this shit
I get superhero money, call a nigga ""super rich""
Keep it ""super"" for a while, let me get on my ""super"" shit
Super ill, super sick, dog, I go super Vick
Ran into a super-woman, turned  her to a super bitch
Hit her with that super dick, she be coming super quick
Super Millz, Mack, Tyga, Streets, Neli, Super Nick
Super Drizzy, Gudda, Chuckee, Twist, that's the super-clique
Now I’m off that ""super"" shit, fuck that shit, I super quit
Running circles 'round the game like a hula hoop and shit
You're gonna have to loop this shit, there won’t be a duplicate
And my blunts be super thick, I'm higher than a Supra kick
I’m the bomb, baby, watch me nuke this shit
When I leave the booth, they gotta scoop this shit
My apologies, diabolically
I’m the prodigy, do you roger me?
I look in the flames and see a hotter me
But how come I’m still colder than commonly
Yeah we run this town, like a lot of feet

Still Got That Rock,Dedication 5,2013.0,"Nigga I be hard on a ho 'cause a bitch ain't shit
And every ho I done fucked done sucked my dick
I had to pour out some drank for niggas I miss
I hope my weed ain't too loud to hear the snakes hiss
It's Dedication 5, medication high
I gotta clean up after these niggas 'cause they be wasting time
And boy, my hoes don't get in line because they stay in line
I'm shining on these hoes so hard they getting tan lines
It's Tunechi, I go hard, I put in work
Twin Glocks, the gift and the curse
Dirty money, no footprints in dirt
We geeked up, the revenge of the nerds
I swear, play with these niggas, that's that shit I don't do
As long as money talks, I got someone to talk to
Watch my dogs treat the beef like dog food
I got the power, but a short fuse, let's go
I can't trust my iPhone, I think Siri the Feds
You know snitches get stitches, nigga, needle and thread
You better walk it like you talk it or we cut off your legs
Pretty please don't kill my vibe, I ain't too proud to beg
Alright, fucking right, shoot you up at the light
Straight take all your possessions, call that shit Poltergeist
And my homie, he a sniper, we call him Wesley Snipes
I call my bitch Plane Jane 'cause she catch nut like a flight
I'm on a mission to get movie money, stick to the script
Your bitch leaking information, I just follow the drip
Soon as I get that coupe, I'mma go get the rims
Toss the keys to my homie, tell that nigga it's his
I feel like He-Man when I'm in your ho
And tell that bitch give me my space, like a telescope
In her throat like Ricola, my system solar
I'm too young to die sober, your man a cobra
Watch that nigga, let's go
Boy, my bitches got bitches badder than your bitches
But I can't trust none of them bitches though, like magicians
Straight blowing money fast, I'mma get a ticket
Soon as I get off paper, I'mma smack a nigga
No broken mirrors, I can't see myself broke
Right back pocket, flag redder than a velvet rope
Never say never, she might do her friend, you never know
Shorty make that dick stand up like it's telling jokes
I swear to God, I put in work
I'm on them shrooms, my goons on alert
I spit these bars, this a uni-verse
You better duck, like Dooney and Bourke
I'm telling ya, shout out Turk
It's Hot Boys, bitch, the block is hot
If I ain't have the keys to success I would have picked the lock
Diarrhea, shit don't stop, until my fucking casket drop
Still got that crack, maybe one day I'mma pass the rock

Pure Colombia,Dedication 5,2013.0,"I can't trust these niggas, throw some water on 'em

They tell me ""Go to Hell,"" Okay I know the owner
Strip clubs gettin old all the strippers hoein'
All these bitches think they dimes, watch me flip a coin
Thank You Jesus, My dogs is off the leashes
Had to leave my spanish bitch 'cuz she was startin' to get suspicious
Tell The Beef I mean business, suit and tie nigga
You and all your dogs can get euthanize nigga
Trigger happy nigga, I just can’t stop smiling
Thank God I’m fly, I had to thank my pilot
You think you’re calling shots, you got the wrong number
I love Benjamin Franklin more than his own mother
Throw that pussy, throw that pussy
And I don’t want no throw back pussy, man fuck these pussy-
Ass niggas, I lay back and ash Swishers
My new shoes is ass-kickers, she drink cum like she had hiccups
Rest In Peace to my last victim
We be passing blunts, they be passing judgement
5 blunts of that strong, call that strength in numbers
AK’s with Chiquitas
, you shell-shocked like Adidas
Whoever find your body, finders keepers, yeah
It’s that pure Colombia
’Cause soon as the bitch tasted it her tongue was numb
It’s loaded, so I just let her jump the gun
It’s that Dedication 5 and another one, I love it!
Tunechi

Yeah, free Scooter, I'm outchea
Let's get it

I done lost a couple hoes but I'm still a pimp
This change of face on my Rollie, shout out Lil Kim
Park my cars in front my house like I ain't got no garage
Just looking for a bitch to stay down like I'm throwing knives
Mac so paid we 'bout to start calling him Macintosh
I really beat that pussy up them niggas shadow box
These niggas sending threats, I'mma start sending hits
Bring me his head, so I can make sure its him
It's lonely at the top, it's lonely at the top
I think I'm 'bout to jump, niggas phony as a prop
Ain't nothing on me but this chop, turn you, your homies into slop
Put your brains all over the window, people passing window shop
Like ugh, this that pure Columbia
It's just us, fuck the rest we got insomnia
Most likely I done fucked that bitch that's laying under ya
She said she trying to see me, bitch that's Stevie Wonderful
You better, mind your business, hitman with a hit list
YMCMB, the world is ours, seconds minutes
I'm a movie motherfucker, camera man, are you getting this?
Burning blunts like bridges, turn up, missing
Ahhhhh
We out here with that clean work, these niggas selling remix we got clean work
Kill everybody ya'll gone need a limousine hearse
You see I'm armed like a fucking short sleeve shirt!

C5, D-Block, L-O-X
You know?
Yeah, yeah

Say the judge or the jury can't spoil this
Nah, two thirds of the world's most loyalest
I'ma shoot em, I'ma pay the bail, I'm sure of this
I'ma kill em, I'ma get the witness, teach 'em more of this
We never sing, not even on a song, where the chorus is
Dig the hole, get the wood box, bring the florist in
Tell the pastor, tell the family, we was just warnin' them
38's, 45's, all type of Tauruses
About to hit the bong, pour the Holy water in
Celebrating', for participatin', in the slaughterin'
Eatin' steaks at the same spot, they killed Paulie in
Frank White's three in the quarter, tapin' your daughter in
Columbia with the connect, puttin' the order in
Nigga act, we gon' clap, like we the audience
Make sure you wipe down the strap, get rid of all the prints
Do your homework on, whoever you go to war against

I had 20s on my Benz, lend it to all my friends
And everything was all gravy, everything was all gravy
And if I need somethin' call Baby, I need something call Baby
And the streets was callin' me, but a nigga had call waitin'
And yeah we all went through our phases, we all went through our savings
Some niggas stayed on point, some niggas was point shavin'
And sometimes we had to be vegetables
That mean we had to stay patient, 'cause they say you are what you eat
I took the star out of starvation, bitch
I come from a Third World, started rappin' in the fourth grade
Started trappin' in the sixth grade, went platinum in the tenth grade
Dropped out, a nigga gettin' paid, this when Birdman had a fade
This when Hummers didn't come stretch, but Birdman had 'em made
This when pretty bitches set you up, and niggas didn't give two fucks
You had two guns and two phones, you could waste time and get a new cup
But this when niggas had pimp cups, and new rappers got hemmed up
And all them niggas that's bitin' got they fins cut

I know real niggas gon' fuck with this
Like, ""That's that shit I be talkin' 'bout""
I know real niggas gon' fuck with this
Like, ""That's that shit I be talkin' 'bout""

And we gon' be around 'til yo motherfuckin' body rot
And if the Feds bring us in, we get the same time Gotti got
And if the Feds bring us in, we get the same time Gotti got
And if the Feds bring us in, we get the same time Gotti got

Uh
But this when niggas had pimp cups, and dirty money got rinsed up
And the early birds in the wormhole would get so fat that they'd get stuck
We'd clean our fingerprints up, we'd clean the shit we didn't touch
This when niggas called Diddy Puff, lettin' Biggie bump
While I'm sittin' up in that big body, I can show you a dead body
Lotta niggas got pinched, and the snitches ended up dead lobsters
Wrap the birds in red tape, call them bitches Red Robins
Pops had kilos, I needed one ki I would've made copies
Free my niggas down and Rest In Peace to all my dead partners
I smoke 'bout a pound in like a week, and fuck the Weight Watchers
Got my self a brand new triple beam, just to weigh options
I stumbled upon a gold mine, I thank God that it ain't copper
Some niggas were late bloomers, but, boy, look how they've blossomed
Don't know niggas that wear wires but I know niggas that go haywire
I know hoes that play possum, and will bring us to y'all mailboxes
And dead man can't talk and the Feds don't have séances
Look, you put a knot on the end of a condom full of drugs and put it in her pussy
And get through customs, 'cause last time we just took em
I rather be blind before I be the nigga that stand around just lookin'
And you can beat around the bush and find a nigga layin' behind them bushes

I know real niggas gon' fuck with this
Like, ""That's that shit I be talkin' 'bout""
I know real niggas gon' fuck with this
Like, ""That's that shit I be talkin' 'bout""

And we gon' be around 'til yo motherfuckin' body rot

And hi, your name is? Not important
Who cares? Not Weezy Baby, uh

Wake up, I see bad bitch, bad bitch, bad bitch
Makeup on my pillows make me mad, bitch
Without no makeup, I see that bitch as just average
Uber, Uber, Uber, Uber, Taxi
Looking at my Rollie, I got boogers on my Rollie
'Bout to hook up with my whoadies
Got the hook up on that codeine
Got the sugar for your nose ring
Got the blooka, I'm reloading
And according to my darling this dick feels so damn rewarding
I'm reporting out of shorty, she so naughty, me so horny
Kilo on me like I'm Tony, break it down to Rice-A-Roni
Take her out, look like she lonely, I'm gon' candlelight the moment
I'ma vandalize the pussy, she told him ""My phone was roaming""
She be moaning 'til the morning, I be goin' in
I be on it, I be in it, I'm like Foreman on the grill
And I got doormen at the entrance
They got pistols in they trenches
They got rituals, religion
And I'm like, bitch, you know I'm sipping
'Til I die

My name is, Lil Wayne, bitch
Weezy, F. Baby, ha
Her name went, from whatever-it-was
To ""Lil Wayne's bitch"", now that's crazy
And I, I camed in, regained strength
Rebanged it, rotation
Her guy, he's nameless, he ain't shit
Always on the same shit, poor baby

I pour up so much they call me Pour Baby
Kush man, I need a sack like Charles Haley
Sipping to the Big Moe, I'm the Barr Baby
Sip got me moving slow but my thoughts racing, err!
My long days give me short patience
My heart vacant, awards taken
What in tarnation? No information, no statements
Young mula, old mula, mula all ages
Ha-Hallelujah, I'm the Hollygrove 2Pac
Roc-A-Fella, new rock, hundred K in a shoebox
AK and a new Glock go wap-ba-ba-loo-bop
Pray the vest you got save you like a coupon
Hustle 'til my dreadlock is grey as some Poupon
Every day is my birthday, I'm a newborn
Stay on my toes, ask a shoe horn, I ain't got no roof on
Gettin' my No Ceilings 2 on

And hi, I'm brainless, I'm stainless
Entertainment, his lady
And, um, if she ain't thick, then she ain't it
I can't fuck wit' a slim lady
I tried, but Superhead keep complaining
Bitch ancient, bitch shady and she tired
Okay then, I'm skatin'
Doing tricks, call me 'trick Swayze

Okay, In other news and other niggas' hoes
Your wife taste like Honey Nut Cheerios
I'm in the mirror, like ""Ooh, baby""
Who needs a miracle when I got you, baby?
Pimping in my last life, I'm the shit you ass-wipe
Beat the pussy, cat fight, my teeth look like a flashlight
Weed is like a airline, 'cause easily I'm that high
Fistful of money, mix some green in with your black eye
Greedy like a fat guy, I'll eat a nigga franchise
I beat him by a landslide, a leader like a rabbi
I'm leading by halftime, he bleeding, I'm a vampire
His body in the trunk with his feet all on my Alpines
We the niggas, that's right, we all that and fries
Y'all on standby, my broads got cat eyes
Traphouse land lines, boom like land mines
All my bitches allies with Tune on their backsides

So hi, my name is, on her anus
On her cranium, bitch cravin'
And I'm fly, and I'm wavy
And her name is Bust It Baby
And hi, my name is in your mouth, it must be tasty

Beat the odds like mosquitoes

So my open mind got a screen door

But before she do, bitch, wash yo' hands good

You can't make a fist 'cause I'm a handful

But still grew up to be the big bad wolf

But take a good look at what you are lookin' at
You never know when it's your last look
It's written all over my face
It's tattooed, it can't be erased
One of a kind, I can't be replaced

From the brightest flower out the darkest skies

Damn, and if the red dot spot 'em then the hollow head got 'em
Knock his top to his bottom jack
Yeah, you see we grind from the bottom
Just to make it to the bottom at the very bottom of the map
Lil Weezyana piranhas everywhere you at
You gotta wear ya extra condom and a extra gat
Your bitch can get it for actin' like a man
And niggas in Pakistan ain't packin' like your man
I backwards hand your man on command
In front of niggas he cool with them boys on fan
I'm on hot, I adjust in different climates
Ducking the animal keeper runnin' with my primates
You ain't did it till you done it like in five states
Weezy hustle no blubber I put on weight
And in the drought I go on a diet and stretch more
Lose all that weight leave a nigga with stretch marks
You don't even come up to a nigga chest pa' sub par
What the fuck they play it in the club for
Real shit I'm ducking bombs from a drug war
No religion but the cops swear that I'm a drug lord
Father forgive 'em for they know not who they pushin' Lord
Father forgive me if I have to send em to you Lord
I'm just tryin' dodge the shots they send to the God
They ridin' up highway to heaven boulevard
Damn, them niggas pussy and jive
Not even in a eye exam, they ain't lookin' for I
The A and the K will make your face crook to the side
Now when you smilin' everybody gotta look from the side
Cause when you wildin' you ain't lookin' you just lookin' high
And when we hungry you look like pie
Sweet potato-ass nigga, you lemon merengue, apple custard
Cherry jelly, don't make me get the biscuit busta
What up, Gizzle? You my distant brother
Real shit, nigga, same father, different mother
I skip the frontin' and stick to keepin' it trill
You not know me for nothin' other I'm somethin' other
Than people you feel I'm deeper for real I'm deeper than skills
My speeches can kill, rest in peace

Yeah, you underdig, shawty? It's all about one thing nigga
If you bout money, nigga, come fuck with us
If you ain't bout no money, get the fuck from 'round us, nigga
And whatever you bout, we bout it
However you wanna get, we can give it to ya, nigga
All runners, bitch, you underdig? Put your prints in, nigga
Put your feet down and your nuts on the concrete and let's roll

You sleep in the field for trying the dude
I'll bust ya head to the meat turn ya mind to food
Food for thought, think I ain't lyin' to you
I lie his body in grease, set fire to em
I tie his body in sheets put the tires to em
Make em feel the Escalade put his feet in the blades
Damn! I'm the heat in the blaze
And niggas keep they ways when I'm in the streets wit blay What!
My nigga hungry he'll eat the plate
And if I ask the homeboy'll eat ya face, yea!
And though he got me, you can ask I'm like a pool table
I keep the eight, my side pocket side ways
When I pop it leave a nigga sideways for five days
Birdman talk to em

Yeah nigga, I tell em, I'll tell em again shawty
If it ain't bout no money, get and fall the fuck from 'round me nigga

Check my swag, I travel like sound dawg
You play hard and I’m gravel like ground dawg
I'm underground, call me groundhog
Lay down laws, call the ground law
Don't confuse me wit' the law, naw
But just confuse me with my pa because I am the Birdman J.R
I ain't trippin' nigga, I play the corner like Ripken nigga
With the forty Cal Ripken nigga, rip a nigga
Flip your vehicle, split your windshield
Whack ya baby momma but I'll let the kid live
And people say that I am a kid still
Cause the lil nigga still ride on big wheels
You feeling animal then come on and get killed
The Sig peel bandanas like bananas
Say I'm slight bananas I blow a weekend in Havana
In my Cabana wit my bottom bitch from Savannah
Man a train couldn't stop ya man
I man up and you not a man, I stand up say I got my land
I'm the man of my land call it Lil-Weezy-ana
That's the new plan

Yeah nigga, you bout some money get at me nigga

I need a daddy, daddy
Would you be my daddy, daddy? (No ceilings)
Come and make it Wayne down on me

Wide receiver Weezy, throw the pussy at me
The pussy lips smiling, I make the pussy happy
Take them panties off, the pussy lookin' at me
I'm the pussy monster, now get the pussy ready
I like to kiss. She like to kiss
I deep stroke and make her bite her fist
The lights is on, the night is grown
We get it poppin' cause we know we can't when wifey home
California kush - strong as a Titan - is what I'm lightin' on
We get high as fuck then we ""Just Do It"" put your Nikes on
Tattoos on her waist, she like the tattoos on my face
And if there's something she'd like to say
I let her say it on my microphone
She love my style...but that's expected
She coming back to you? The chances anorexic
I knew she had it in her, so I got it out her
She give me neck around the clock: I call it ""round the Carter""
She rub my back, she say I'm tight
She cook, fuck and clean
And still make her flight!
First-class pussy, crystal glass pussy
I get it wetter than bass pussy

I likes it thick and red
Ralph Lauren spread
Lady in the streets, porn star in bed
She like to fuckfight, so we spar in bed
She got that pink pussy, I beat it orange/red
I fuck American pie and I get foreign head
She sit down and ride like I'm a thoroughbred
She kiss mine, and I kiss hers back
If she's a bad bitch
She deserve that
She send me pictures to my iPhone
Then I gotta clear em cause my girl be checking my phone
I'm in the Bentley with the mind blown
When I'm in that pussy, honey, I'm home

I dun been wet, but I can get wetter

I'll test a lion before testifying
All I got is hitters in my squad

I could get you killed, it just take a head nod
I want you dead by tonight, that's a real deadline
Zero fucks given
I make her come to the condo butt naked 'cause, bitch, ain't no stealin'
She still come visit, she don't wan' leave
She compared it to me leaving a witness
I said, ""I get it,"" I keep some cocaine on me for the bitches
And this AK is not for decoration
Fuckboys give me the heebie-jeebies

With hopes that maybe I’ll get a chance to see you
When I close my eyes
I’m going’ outta my head
Lost in a fairytale
Can you hold my hands and be my guide
Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
And I hope it rains
You’re the perfect lullaby
What kinda dream is this

You could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I, don’t wanna wake up from you
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your loves to good to be true
My guilty pleasure I ain’t going no where
Baby long as you’re here
I’ll be floating on air cause you’re my
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I, don’t wanna wake up from you

Yo, young money right here
Bike here, throw it up, no high chair
Cold like a white bear
Freddy Krueger I'm a rap bitch nightmare
And I’m rich I could buy you
Kill bitches leave their body in a bayou
More brain than a IQ
More head than a dread (my youte)
And my bank account ain’t hardly empty
That’s why I come through in a Barbie Bentley
So please mamacita, please no envy
When you come around it reads no entry
Who’s next to go
My flows so flexible
Get gas, then get at me, Texaco
Shoot yourself in the leg, Plaxico
White jag with the twisted lip
I ain't Mike Jack but This is it!
B- b- b- boo I'm everywhere
You're like balloon boy mama you was never there!
I am the Kung Fu Panda
Fuck all your blogs, fuck all your propaganda
Good for the goose then its good for the gander
Nicki ain't a rapper, Nicki is a brander
Please you can never compare to me
All these bitches is scared of me
I am who they couldn’t even dare to be
So that's all folks, badibadee
I go hard, pause
Hospital flow, get more gauze
I'm a bad bitch on all fours
The President be like, ""It's all yours!""
Weezy and Nicki bring the A-game, high stats
Go together like Ricky and his eye patch
Go together like a team in the gym
Kareem and the ring
, the queen and the king

You could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I, don’t wanna wake up from you
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your loves to good to be true
My guilty pleasure I ain’t going no where
Baby long as you’re here
I’ll be floating on air cause you’re my
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I, don’t wanna wake up from you

Kush it out, red bone pussy mouth
Eat you up, spit you out
Fuck your girl in your house
I’m terrible be careful
You might want say a prayer or two
So cold I need theraflu
I'm so high I need parachutes
I'm error proof, I'm never spooked
Got my coupe, heaven blue
And my flag red as hell, think your sweet as devils food
I never lose
My weapons use
Fuck with me wrong, shit get ugly, Devin Dude
And she’s the queen
Two’s a couple, three’s a scene
Weezy that nigga that you see in your dreams
Get the pussy wet Abita Springs
, huh, I'm Easter clean
Shout to my home girl Mika Means
Anything we want we redeem
You niggas gassed up ‘93 supreme
Nicki Minaj is the hardest bitch
More than an artist bitch
She talk a whole lot of shit
And walk around like she President Carters bitch
She be on her Barbie shit
And me I'm on The Carter 6
And I can turn crumbs to bricks
And I can turn nuns to tricks
Young mula baby
Fuck your feelins'
And this is No Ceilings
Yeah…

You could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare

Look at the bullshit we been through
Had our niggas sitting on top their roofs
Hurricane Katrina, we should've called it Hurricane (Georgia) Bush
Then they telling y'all lies on the news
The white people smiling like everything cool
But I know people that died in that pool
I know people that died in them schools
Now what is the survivor to do?
Got to no trailer, you gotta move
Now it's on to Texas and to (Georgia)
They tell you what they want, show you what they want you to see
But they don't let you know what's really going on
Make it look like a lotta stealing going on
Boy them cops is killas in my home
Nigga shot dead in the middle of the street
I ain't no thief, I'm just trying to eat
Man fuck the police and President (Georgia) Bush
So what happened to the levees, why wasn't they steady?
Why wasn't they able to control this?
I know some folk that live by the levee
That keep on telling me they heard explosions
Same shit happened back in Hurricane Betsy
1965: I ain't too young to know this
That was President Johnson but now it's (Georgia) Bush

We from a town where (Georgia) everybody drowned, and
Everybody died, but baby (Georgia) I'm still praying with you
Everybody crying but (Georgia) ain't nobody tried
There's no doubt on my mind, it was (Georgia) Bush!

Now, I was born in the boot at the bottom of the map
New Orleans baby, now the White House hating
Trying to wash us away like we not on the map
Wait, have you heard the latest
They saying that you gotta have paper if you tryna come back
Niggas thinking it's a wrap
See we can't hustle in they trap, we ain't from (Georgia)
Now it's them dead bodies, them lost houses
The mayor say don't worry bout it
And the children have been scorned, no one's here to care 'bout 'em
And fat shout, to all the rappers that helped out
Yeah we like to thank all of y'all, but fuck President (Georgia) Bush
When you see them Confederate flags, you know what it is
A white cracker muthafucka that probably voted for him
And no he ain't gonna drop no dollars, but he do drop bombs
R.I.P. Tig' cause he died in the storm
Fuck President (Georgia) Bush
See us in ya city man, give us a pound
Cause if a nigga still movin' then he holdin' it down
I had two Jags, but I lost both them bi-tches
I'm from N.O. the N.O. Yeah!

We from a town where (Georgia) everybody drowned, and
Everybody died, but baby (Georgia) I'm still praying with you

Yep, I'm a motherfuckin' trip
I'm a trip to Japan and buy some brand new shit
900 to a grand, get you 28 grams
If you talking bout bricks, I'm the interstate, man

Walking a thin line, gotta defend mine
And with no pen I'm sorta like a bomb ""Boom""
Young Tune, yeah that's what my people call me
50 thousand for the cross, tryna keep the reaper off me

Big money for the grill, so I'm never cheap talking, yeah
Keep talking and the flame leap off the hip
And keep sparking, pap pap sleep softly
Yeah, nap nap, nap sack, three forties

Young New Orleans nigga, nigga just don't be retarded
We done lost everything and you looking like a bargain
Purple weed, purple drink, Purple Heart sergeant
I'm the best rapper in the game, no arguing
And I don't even write, pause
Un-pause this, so keep your bitch ass lines inside the margin
Lil Wayne dot com bitch, log in
Put a pillow under your knees and keep ya jaws in
All in ya girl mouth, use her like a toilet
They usually want a baller and the young nigga ballin'
Mike Jordan, pardon my swag
But my father rich as fuck and all my brothers left the family
We said ""fuck it"" - bought 2 houses in Miami
I can't wait to do Cribs; MTV, come on, get at me
Any rapper wan' get at me, tell ya label contact me
Half a hundred for a feature, wanna battle? I'll beat ya
I'm a beast, I'm a creature, I'm the son of Miss Cita
Mom dukes, my Jeter, she the reason, she the reason
Everybody woman wanna be the boy diva, not even
There's a 305 dime I wanted ever since I seen her
Got a topic of this evening, hotter than a tub steaming
Gotcha girlfriend dreaming of one day being Trina
Not a sim simma, 10 keys in the Beamer
Got a white girl driving: couldn't do it much cleaner
I'm fly in the sky like that motherfuckin' ribbon
Bitches got my name on em, and the nigga still livin'
Spend a condo in the club, one bottle won't do
Two bottles won't do, bottles for the whole crew, thanks
And bring me that Patron, I don't play
No ice I like my drink straight, not gay
And bitch that bank come everyday, I'm paid
I wish a nigga come invade, get sprayed
I stomp a nigga out like I got ten legs
Then they fish the nigga up out the lake in ten days
Behave, no ho, I'm on that rage flow
Cash Money, Young Money, ho that money age old
And can't a cage hold this animal from Hollygrove
Sorry mami I be stoned, I be, I be, I be blowed
Got me copy rock star, Weezy Baby fuck these hoes
Gotta pay me now for me to even take these hoes
Price rising for a show and the flow
So either Drama is my nigga, or that boy got dough
Go figure that's my nigga, that's my nigga, my nerve

Suicide, it's a suicide
Tell 'em seek and you will find 'cause I'ma lose my mind
Kick a nigga ass, then give him my shoes to shine
It's do or die, I come from where we used to crime
The Uzi 9 more important than school supplies, the pools is dry
My niggas and the food is fried, the news is lies
The pigeons is too spooked to fly, the rules denied
All the toughest goons is mine, that's Tunechi's slimes
They kill you and go do the time, we unified
Young Money revolutionized the new design
We had to leave the flukes behind and supersize
The numbers through the roof and sky
Don't look too surprised, look through the lines
We makin' moves and strides, grooves and vibes
I'm too alive, these hoes need to be supervised
They put on a cute disguise, you grooms is blind
She get dick and an Uber ride, number two with fries, I'm pimpin'
Now, who am I? I'm who and why
I'm rude and kind, my cars are computerized
I'm cruisin' by, smokin' blunts Ruben size
You fools can try, these tools getting utilized, you euthanized
Brrt, skrrt, shoot, then drive
Now, who survived? We comin' back to rewind
I'm usually high, sippin' on the Houston wine
Feel humanized, I want my throne to recline
Jackie red, Julie blonde, they Cuban fine
I bruise they spine, 
I leave and they snooze 'til nine
Superglued to the grind, my crew my tribe
These bitches try to divide, we too divine
Got the drugs to provide the coolest highs
The greenest green and the white with the bluest eyes
The syrup and the juice collide, the two combine like suits and ties

Leave the beef in the streets and bring the bread home, nigga
Yeah, tell the doctor, ""Step aside, please""
Dr. Carter, gasoline in your IVs
Strong dry weed, make my eyes bleed
Strong-arm rap, I rock a iron sleeve
Ugh, I'm in the zone like the secondary
No lie, bitch, I’m flyer than a pet canary
I’m a dog on the beat, fuck the vet-inary
Two women praise me like Mary Mary
Ugh, I'm in the zone like college ball
Spit fire like I’m sipping on a Molotov
Loose bowels, this shit so easy
I might send this to the Mixtape Weezy
 (Ugh!)

Knuck If You Buck,"Young Money: The Mixtape, Vol. 1",2006.0,"Young Maine for President
I'll probably paint the White House black if it was my residence
Bush back in office, some niggas feel that's irrelevant
Cause they still pedalin' this medicine, but anyway, anyday
I can zurk off quick and make my semi spray
Send some of my men away just to blow your men away
Stephon Marbury type bullets, they like the penetrate
Young Money, we outta school, but we got chemistry
Young Spitta, Young Maine, Young Cop, Young Mobb, Tez Poe
We don't pass the rock nigga, we ball hog
Mad slow in the Escalade nigga, y'all all fall
Jack your fresh ass Caddy and steal your white walls
Nigga, we don't like y'all
Hell yeah, we will fight y'all
We ain't on no Tyson shit
We ain't tryna' bite y'all
Knuckin' if you buckin', probably bustin' at your cousin
How youngins' that spout something
Y'all niggas ain't 'bout nothin'

Nigga we bussin', and bussin', to the bang of buss
No, we don't run for the Olympics, but the flame with us
I got that tussin', that scummy, and that angel dust
So pick your high, I will supply and correct changes, what's up
We bring the bussin', we bussin' like this thang for us
You niggas is sleeveless man, you can't hang with us
I got a bitch who speak Spanglish
She keep her bangles danglin'
And the cocaine is right up in her anus
Old Wayne is right up in the spot where he supposed to
Be, got Hova at the game and now he coachin'
Me, but I've been the champion, happy as I ever been
Lampin' in the Hamptons like, what the fuck is a hammock
The chef up in the kitchen like, what the fuck is a sammich
I'm like, we gotta find middle ground, we need balance
Challenge me, that be to my advantage
I'm outstanding, like standing outside up in the twister and walking not damaged
Standing outside up in the blizzard and walking hot handed
Serving nicklebags in Iraq, bet I will not panic
Swerve the nickel black, if I wreck, bet I will not panic
Cop another one the next day and drive it crazier
The seats will be lazier, shit'll be gravier
Nina Sarafeena my girl, so then I baby her
Wavin' at her at 2 crazy, Fugazis, I'm too brazen, 3 brazees deep
We got .380s and P80
9s, 9s, M-10ss and M1s and 12 gauges
Shell cases, money put up for jail cases, bail make it
My momma say, tuck your chain son, they'll take it
I hit her with one of them stale faces, like
I'll be damned momma, they know who I am momma
I'm still your little boy, but to them, I'm the man momma
Fuck with your boy, man Hollygrove the hood, nigga
Throw it in your face 'til you get that understood

Niggas know I'm heavy with the coke, with the coke
In the Impala SS and sittin' heavy on the spokes
Never am I broke man, I'm playin with some change
I get a nigga soaked like he playing in the rain
And everywhere I go, a ho starin' at my chain
I'm the most valuable player in the game
All these haters wanna ride me
Cause I got more kicks than niggas with black belts in karate
Keep a redbone with a real nice body
Just copped a 'Lac and a yellow Maserati
Niggas ain't fuckin with the dawg
When Young Money shoppin', we don't leave nothing in the mall
These niggas ain't as rich as us
Man your rims too small, get your motherfucking inches up
Cause I copped me a Benz today
Just to go on 106 & Park and hand the keys over to Free and AJ

To listen to me whine?""
She's askin', ""who's on the other line?""
You diss me everytime
I tell her, baby I'm a star, shit, I'm above the stars
And now, I done got so high, I done forgotten who you are

I tell her
I'm in love with you
But I can't be with you
Tomorrow I'll be back up on the first flight
Right up out of town

Hop back in my spaceship
Girl, I gotta drop your ass off
Cause I just come to take it
Then you know I gotta take off
But I'mma be here next week
So call your company and take off
Cause she say ""Wayne you ain't shit
You got me all impatient""
Cry me a river
I can hear my conscience while I sail off

Boy you got a problem
And you ain't foolin' no one but yourself
You're like a hot revolver
But you ain't killin' no one but yourself
And soon she's gonna find someone to love
And you gon find yourself, so all alone

One minute she love me, the next minute she hate me
That's two minutes of my time she done wasted
She say she pray she have Weezy F's baby
And I be having seizures, but she say she can't shake me
And my homies say she's cuter than my other bitches
And every time I'm in that pussy it feel custom-fitted
I swear I like her more than she think I do
Girl, when I think of you
My dick just start to jumpin' like a fucking kangaroo
I suck and fuck and finger you
But you want me to cling to you
And I ain't asking you to change
Cause I know I can't jingle you
I got my ways...
And you have your days...
And we gave it our best shot
But I just got grazed

Cut your tongue off, leave you speechless
Put some money on subpoenas
Could've gave that to Miss Cita
Nigga stunner, he a skeezer
From the heart and out the speakers
I was young, I heard the preacher
I grew up and met the reaper

She snort two and want a threesome
She snort three lines, yell ""Adidas""
When I bust I yell ""Eureka""
When I bust I yell ""Eureka""
When she bust she yell for Jesus
Drop her off at the cathedral
She come back with a bunch of singles
Phones are tapped, we switch the lingo
Hustle where the grass is greener
Clean the blood off the walls
Then break out the Stanley Steamer
It's a drought on cocaina
I know routes through Pasedena
I got two keys of that Bieber
Call 'em Justin and Justina
Sippin' on that Angelina

White power from a negro
Spent some money on my legal

With a bride and no tuxedo
I'm a bitch magnet, Magneto

Run around this bitch like Ezekiel
Good Quality coke, that's GQ

Took her out the game, sent her to the bleachers
Kick her out in style, Balenciaga sneakers
Broke up with my bitch, I feel like shit, my dog
She kept talkin' fifty-fifty, had to split, my dog
She kept on fallin' in and out of love, I tripped her dog
Told me eat or get ate, so I sipped her dog
I'ma go platinum, she single
She blow up my phone, but the bitch got no ringer
Bought her a ring but I left with a finger
Stack up my cake and I bust down some zingers
Hello, ho, you gots to go, ho
I'm on the road, ho, high profile, movin' work on the low

I ain't snitching, your honor
Hate bitch niggas, bitches with power
Vacate when that kitchen get hotter
I just sit on the counter, open the cabinet, close the cupboard
Put that jar in the skillet, drop a four in the bubbles
I remember being young, tryna hustle my dope
Tryna tell the old junkies that my crack ain't soap
Tryna to tell you 'fore you jump that my Mac ain't broke
You ain't tryna see how far that black back lane go, no!
Call me Pac-Man, your ghost is blue
I got my red-river rubies
 and my ocean blue jewelry
Usually I'm a hooligan for the money
Yeah, I'm eating, but I got a tapeworm in my tummy, oh!
Make harm and I bomb you in public
Hit you with the straight-arm, no warning, nothing
Look, it's morning, no yawning or nothing
I ain't sleeping, I'm up, tryna take a nigga lunch
You gon' make a nigga break a nigga fronts
Then shake a nigga shorts and we taking what we want
I'm so 504 you got to kill me here
If you ever looking for me, bitch, I will be here
Cash Money is an army
, Navy Seal me here
Lot of niggas ran from me, but I still be here
No chrome on the Continental, I'm so fundamental
Crack the Phil', crack the roof and roll up the windows
And my hood love me, they tell me ""Bring it home""
That's why I holler ""Hollygrove!"" on each and every song
You leaping at a dog, a dog with no bark
Just a bite like an old shark

I miss you and I know you missin me, Gizzle, but

Man, I miss my dawgs, many nights club poppin
Many nights we were blowin trees, many nights we were hustlin

I had already made my name in the clique
But you got famous and shit
I got my soulja rag and dangled my shit
I was honored just to hang wit you, shit
And I banged to the boogie-bang-bang with ya clique
And I ain't even from the 3, my hood was angry at me, shit
But I rose to my feet, played the post with the heat
At them shows while you performed and posed
I was waitin for a nigga to jump, see I was patient
But was ready to dump, cuz you my brother, chump
Real Gs never buckle up
But every family ain't filled wit gangstas that's real
And that's real and I would never turn my back
Or turn ya down, even if you turned around, muthafucka

I miss you and I know you missin me, Juvie, but

Many nights we were blowin trees, many nights we were hustlin
Man I miss my dawgs, me and you through thick and thin
Me and you through the very end, for only you I'll sin again

You was my nigga, my nerve, my joy, my hurt
My main muthafuckin man Turk (oh!)
My other, my partner, I was teacher, he was father
I skilled, he schooled, we chilled, we moved
We thug, we hung, we ate, we slept
We lived, we died, I stayed, you LEFT!
Remember how we played to the left?
And we stayed out of trouble 'cause we stayed to our self
'Member B and Slim would leave and the keys over?
Tell us not to go Uptown and we went straight to tha Nolia
While I watched you reunite wit yo souljas
And yo mom and brothers, while I lied to the Stunna
Yeah, those were the times my brother
Now I recognize real and I eye my brother
Yeah, nigga, Semaj my brother, the Sqad's my brother
The niggas you left behind is my brothers!

Plus these bitches be stalking trying look for a fortune
In the Chi we say church when the pussy gets purchase
Got a bitch so bad she make a player get nervous
Now good ain't good enough and my hood is hood as fuck

Wander around 'til it found me
You know like, the gossip found me
Then why don't try provin' it?
How? You don't know how to prove it?
Well, what you just do is, stop
(Streetrunner)

Stop hatin' on a nigga
That is a weak emotion, the lady of a nigga
And you can get tipped like you're waitin' on a nigga
Put a body bag and a apron on a nigga
I give my all behind the mic
But you can never see if you sit behind the light
And you don't have to pick me to win the title fight
But I'mma wear that championship belt so tight
And if I'm wrong, there is no right
And if I'm wrong, there is Snow White
I'm tryna be polite
But you bitches in my hair like the fuckin' po-lice
And my flow is rare, these other rappers nice
These other rappers bark, some of 'em even bite
But I'm much more bright, I give the game sight
So before you dim the light, you just might, might wanna

Think it over
Ooooh, think it over
Think it over, baby baby (Get 'em)

Stop! Analyzing, criticizing
You should realize what I am and start epitomizing
Legitimate, I got the heart of the biggest lion
I'm confident, like fuck 'em all, pull out my dick and ride it
My flow sick, so sick, it's like my shit is dying
It rains a lot in my city because my city's crying
Because my city's dying
Still I emerge from all of that, I am a living pion–eer, near Zion
Fear God, not them, steer my robin coupe
Through the streets of the Boot, and soo-woo!
And then I leak blood in the booth, I leave a bloodbath
Sorry, there's a tub in the booth, now where the drugs at?
I'm twisted like the strings on a shoe, no, nigga, fuck that
I'm twisted like the strings on a boot, now where New Orleans at?
I feel hip-hop stole me like a bus pass
So in your possession, I-I-I must ask

Hey, haven't I been good to you?
(Think it over) Tell me, haven't I been sweet to you?

Drag my name through the mud, I come out clean
Cast away stones, I won't even blink
A gun is not a math problem, I won't even think
Just leave you dead like the mink under my sink
Don't believe in me, don't believe me
I graduated from hungry and made it to greedy
My flow is like pasta, take it and eat it
But I'm gon' need cheese if I'm baking a ziti
You niggas want beef, I want a steak, and, uh, we be
Lost in Amsterdam or Jamaica where weed be
Hardbody nigga just takin' it easy
All about my paper, 'bout my paper like E-Z
Wider wrappers, why do rappers lie to fans, lie to rappers?
Lot of rappers lie like actors, cut the motherfuckin' cameras
Cut the check, nigga, fuck your props
And make it out to ""Mr. Hip-Hop""

Everyday We Sick,Dedication 6,2017.0,"Everything was meant, everything was meant
I took a L, what comes after L? My nigga — Ms
That AK with the twins, that's Mary Kate and sis
My shooters, they don't miss; fade away, then swish
Dedication 6
, and every day we sick
Treatin' medication scrips like some Revelation scripts
I thought yesterday we quit
But you know, every day we spent
Then we celebrate the win like we'll never play again
Lord I just talked to my hitman, he say that he made a list
Nigga always breakin' in, and he never leave a print
And I never shaved a brick, OK, now I'm talkin' shit
Where that bakin' soda mix? Raise my Arm & Hammer fist
And my yellowbone, she thick, and her belly don't exist
And she never saw the gym, she stay healthy 'cause she strip
Doin' very late events, and I never paid a cent
Pussy never leave a scent, Toni Braxton, breathe again
Every day, all week, we lit, you know every day we sip
And we having steak and shrimp with some naked waitresses
Told that bitch to bring a friend, you know that we make 'em kiss
She know if it's goin' down, I keep a elevator lit
Now where the elevator music? Yeah, they better play the hits
I can serenade a bitch, you interrogate a bitch
If we interrogate that bitch, we be like ""Where that safe at, bitch?""
Put that barrel to her tits, and if she hesitate, that's it
I need that combination bitch, 'cause I ain't got no patience bitch
I hate to do it, but the line between love and hate is thin
You know every day we win, you know second place ain't shit
You know that we take the kids, just like Freddy, Jason, IT
You know that we spray and dip, one-eight-seven, eighty-six
While you eatin' bacon grits again while police takin' tips
You know every day we drip, drippin' wet Mercedes-Benz
Drippin' wet and glazy clit, you know every day she drenched
This that 
Dedication 6
, you know every day we sick
Give me wet, a life, a gift, catch a body like the Lyft

I tell her pussy ""Take your lick"", I'm big-headed, make it fit

Don't we make a cute couple?
To a broke heart we look like 2 bucks
I got a posse full of hitters
And a pocket full of ""In God We Trust""
It's been so long since I said ""It cost too much""
I'm so addicted to the fast money lifestyle
And withdrawal sucks
And dead presidents act immortal
But I know you see money's not a problem
Bal' like a butch bitch

Top peeled back like the skin of a potato
Seat way back, listening to Anita Baker
Riding by myself, smoking weed by the acre
Hollygrove gator, ain't nobody greater
Leave you with some bullet holes the size of craters
You ain't heard the latest, Weezy F. the greatest
Battle anybody, nigga, fuck over your favorite
It's a new game, and I'm the coach like Avery
Leave it to the flow, we getting dough like the bakery
I don't really want to, but these niggas makin' me
Put a motherfucker on ice like the Maple Leaves
That's a hockey team, and I ain't on no hockey team
But I'm a champion, where's the fucking Rocky theme?
Damn, rest in peace, Apollo Creed
I'm a monster, every day is Halloween
A lot of syrup, lot of pills, and a lot of weed
And I keep my pockets green like a pod of peas
And if you hating, baby, you can get a side of deez
Deez nuts in your mouth, and can you swallow, please?

Hundred thousand on a bottle champagne
Half a million for a watch with no diamonds
Brought cash to the jewelers, still had change
Ooh, sharks in the crib and in the backyard
Elevator in the house, never got stuck
I just looked in the mirror, got star struck
I just looked at your bitch and got eye-fucked
Who the fuck wanna race? Put your money up
All you see is license plates far in front of ya
I gave a bad bitch a taste of the good life
She licked her lips twice and told me that I'm yummier
Glass house on the block, five floors in it
Got a picture on the wall that cost more than it

Judge mad 'cause a nigga make more than him
Ignoring him, I know you can't ignore the rims
I'm going in 'til I'm pouring in more than M's
I'm courtin' swimsuit models that don't know who I am
And foreign twins, I tell 'em that I star in films

When I ain't trippin' then my lawyers is
So what the charges is?
Put it on my tab, baller shit

Looking in my son's eyes
Only time I see a upside
I tell him he gon' be a tough guy
Never be a punchline
Tell him never wait in one line
Tell him not even a lunch line
Pray more than sometimes
When the cops come, you tongue-tied
Take dirt, make a mud pie
Lookin' out the window
In the coupe with a bimbo
Talking 'bout who she resemble
Bitch, you in a Enzo
Stop being so simple
Now fuck me like we in a limo
I ain't got time to kill, I got voids to fill
I got ocean views, I got water bills
I got cards to deal, I got hearts to steal
I got larger wheels on my automobile
I lost appeal
The bullshit cost me a mill
It brought me to tears
I came home and bought me a crib
I walk through that bitch
Strapped when it's dark in that bitch
And through hell and high water, I just walk on a bridge
I got a full cup of lean that I saw in the fridge
I started to swig
But end up drinking all of that shit
'Cause I deserve it, I be working hard for all of this shit
I step into a Rolls Royce when I walk out the pen

Gave all five fingers a sun-tan
Haters upset, that's a fun fact
I got pussy in my lunch bag
I got soap and I got towels
Bullet showers lead to bloodbaths
I got hoodies that say 'Young Money'
I got bitches that steal them from me
They go home and then they send pictures
To my phone with nothing under it
What am I to do? I'm lovin' it
I run a bad-ass bitches company
That's my company, my bitches humble me
I saw your bitches, that was comedy
I got the romedy, oops I meant remedy
I got the chemistry, and the amenities
Up in my bedroom, holding assembly
They leave feelin' good; physically, mentally
Meditate, meditate; think about yesterday
Fuck what that nigga say, think about yesterday
I can't do everyday, I could do very late
Just hit me up and now go check my resume
Get out that Chevrolet, jump in this better Wraith
I know you see the doors open like Heaven Gates
She think I'm Heaven sent, and I would not forgive every sin
But I forget everything
Thanks to the medicine, thanks to the purple stuff
I'm finna pour it up, I'm finna stir it up
If I had a heart it'd be a purple one
Pockets too fat, I'm pulling my girdle up
Shots of Bumbu, I'm finna serve 'em up

I've been on my feet since the day I started walking
Bitch, I think I'm MC Hammer, put the nail in the coffin
Sell coke in a drought, sell pussy at an auction
Bullets got a nigga running fast enough to race horses
Around here you sniff these lines, you don't cross 'em
Kill your ass and leave you behind like an orphan

Still getting baseball money; Barry Larkin
Around here we play for keeps, yeah, we eating, but we starving
I get me a little money, try to spread it margarine

I say I go into my beastmode - rapping niggas, I eat those
I tell a bitch take a deep breath then bend them knees like a freethrow
I don't want me no good girl, I fell in love with these freak hoes
In my bedroom I make a movie, it's starring me with that Lee Rose
Cause I ball hard like D-Rose

my stash on closet
Racks in my pocket, these racks I deposit
Got racks on my conscience, money on my mind
I got shooters on my team, they got bodies on their nine
Look at that bad bitch right there, see that body on that dime
I ain't swimming in no ho, you know I'm probably on that grind
All these niggas hating on me, me, but I ain't on that time, time
Cause I be in the back, nigga, and I ain't talking about swine
I'm talking 62 West, they say a nigga too fresh
You a rat, your homie singing y'all should do a duet
Shawty told me she loving my swag, I make that pussy too wet
You niggas banned, and my hoes and I'm like why they'd do that? Go

Uhm, I don't have a conscience, all my friends are monsters
They visit me so constant and talk to me about nonsense
Like stabbing you and then watching you fight for your life like you boxing
Bitch, deuce deuce, I smoke that OG killer Bobby Johnson
I'll olly over that bitch head, it's Hollygrove til I'm fucking dead
I did a bid for that toast, so fuck with me I'll treat you like butterbread
But I still go hard with no regard, 
Earth ain't shit, bitch, go to Mars
Leave a nigga dead in the gutter
I'll just beat him with a bloody ass bowlingball
I'm fresh as hand sanitizer, don't hate the game, just analyze it
Two xanax', I'm fantasizing about fat bitches' panty sizes
Take a bullet to the chest, be a man about it
Stop acting like a little bitch nigga, most of y'all niggas is bitch niggas
I got a tiger in the basement, Big Tigger
My hair long, my dick bigger
My hair long, my dick bigger

Car parked by itself, robot stunting
And it’s voice activated, I just tell it something
I ain’t even gotta press a button
Viper with the rally stripes, I don’t eat no Rally’s
I don’t eat my words, nigga, I don’t eat no salad
I got too much on my plate, I got too much on my palate
Never seen my car before, it’s like a unicorn in traffic
Too much fucking talent, rap Shakespeare, go Hamlet
You other boys could kiss the game goodbye, be romantic
Please don’t worry, Nancy, all my weed is organic
If my children end up smoking
I'll whip they ass if they don’t pass it
Hold up, I just got a package
I let my bitch test it, with flying colors, passed it
Burning money fast like fire on the plastic
You dead man walking throw some tires on your casket
They say niggas in wheelchairs is half dead as it is

Boy, I think your whole clique’s Summer’s Eve, Massengill
Monastat 7, Vagisil

And my flow don’t need no ad-libs

Boom – It’s my shot like Biloxi
Even my shadow don’t trust me
Big dog in this shit, like a Husky
285, 20 pounds of musty
Stopped by the spot, had to serve Pooh bear
He buy one, I front him one, so I left two there
In a two-seater, pull up popping 2Pac
Didn’t have a safe, so I stashed it in my tube sock
Eat so much Benihana's I need nunchucks
You just a old nigga always saying, ""Big bruh""
You a bad bitch always saying, ""Big Daddy""
You a real nigga talking ‘bout you want a selfie
Uh, a baby bottle with my shit in
And my role model was a kingpin
I say, ""Let’s work,"" he say, ""Let’s work""
Let your next work be your best work

And it’s that Sorry 4 The Wait 2
And I’m so sorry for the wait, too
From New Orleans to the A, TRU

Going zagga zow off of zagga xans
From the middleman to the Macho Man
I've been talkin' shit up in Diddy house
Went to Disneyland, talked to Mickey Mouse
Then I figured out how to figure out
What I was figurin' out, you figure it out
Got a trigger man with an extra hand
My bitches sleep by my bitch's house
So every party is a slumber party
Sky is the limit, head in the clouds
While you runnin' round, I'ma run it up
You dumb it down, I ain't dumb enough
I hit the courtroom and stunk it up
High comin' down, plug comin' up
You gon' hold me down, you gon' hold me up
You don't know me, but you know what's up
And the coke was cut with some extra coke
Showed her more than love, she just shoulder-shrugged
She don't know it's love, it's not important love
As long as we can keep extortin' the plug
Just let him bleed and ignore the blood
Just let him be and ignore the buzz
Pour it up, catch a sugar rush
Chopper full of rust, but it still bust
Bust good as fuck, every bullet struck
Like a hundred holes, got a hole-in-one
Safe full as fuck, money full of dust
And I'm pulling up in that ""What the fuck?""
That's a muscle car, got me lookin' buff
If you look enough, you a mussel, punk
That's a Bugatti on steroids
Bugatti on Chevron
All-white like an Altoid
All these rings on, call me Bellboy
From the Teflon to the Kevlar

A bitch back at the crib tryna live
A pool in the back, I let her swim
I give her phone back and let her film
Free will like the goodwill
She real thick, waist real lil
Weed real bright, it look teal
Coke real white, it look clear
0 to 100 to a mill
From nothin' to somethin' to a big deal
Got to keep it trill in the field
I ain't Cash Money no more
And I put some carats on my bitch's wrist
Put some carats on my bitch's fist
Put some carats in my bitch's ears
I came fast money, let's go
And my heart goes out to Vegas, keep it real
I just met some strippers on the strip
Flew 'em to Miami, take a trip
Flew 'em back to Vegas with some gifts
That's just how it is, is, is
Ain't trickin' if you got it, nigga rich
I feel like satan, nigga lit
Dedication 6-6-6
G-Wagon on six wheels
They in they feelin's, fuck how niggas feel
Coke in the car, I'm in a snowmobile
I'm sippin' that Evander Holyseal
This is that codeine overkill
My mud colder than Soldier Field
In love, but all these hoes is weird
These hair triggers, I might grow a beard
Brazy, yeah, but you know the drill
I'm way up there, you right over here
Have you ever seen the light hit my grill?
I stand there and smile in the mirror
Snap my fingers, dollars appear
Out of nowhere and I don't do L's
And I married the mob when I was like twelve
Turned out well, like Tom and Giselle
Ain't readin' texts 'cause I'm readin' checks
I don't text 'cause that is finger sex
Then I'm turnin' off my ringer next
Airplane mode, no I'ma need a jet
I'm dope, babe, I need a needle set
Chains rock it, can't see the neck
Pockets crowded like the Beatles set
I drop it off and gave Ms. Cita that
Whip milky, I'ma sip filthy
I sip this shit just like it's healthy
Who spilt it, wait my bitch guilty?
Uber, Uber; she'll be missed dearly
Sincerely, yeah it's yours truly
Call me Tune, the hoes call me Tunechi
Rockin' Louis while the pot brewin'
With a Chinese bitch that look like thot suey
Told the straight hoes I'm taken
Told the gay hoes I'm vacant
Took some diamonds out her old bracelet
Put 'em on the quotes in my statements
I'm a born slanger, a born slanger
One more time, I'm a born slanger
Draco like a volcano
You can fuck around and get your star spangled
Barbaric, yeah your bitch starin'
I look very good, good very
It ain't all about the werewolf
It's all about what the wolf wearin'
You a popped cherry, yeah a Cherry Bomb
We everywhere like the Marriott
Shots sprayed like Malaria
Hit your head like a Triceratops
For my dawg, I'll kill you and your ho
Yeah, me and my dawg, we put another on the road
Hold up my female dawg, she 'bout to put on a show
But to get my dawg back, I'd give up all of these hoes",https://genius.com/Lil-wayne-my-dawg-lyrics

That's been my hood since a snotty-nose
I come through the hood, suicidal doors
I used to come through the hood on the handlebars
Gat in my draws, money in my pocket, crack in my jaws
I hope it don't dissolve
And you know I'm ducking Five-O and my moms
Young'un quick to go off like car alarms
Now, the young'un keep his mind on the Parmesan
Them other niggas ain't eating, like a Ramadan
Spit the shit that make you feel it in your chromosomes

And when you're rappin' as
Vivid as I, your limit is the sky, so I
Study B.I., I bang 2Pac
I hum Aaliyah, and Soulja Slim was a leader
Who am I not to follow greatness?
I give these MCs hell like they all atheists
Tell them hatin' niggas, ""One!"" like they in The Matrix
And tell the cops I can buy my own bracelets
I'ma keep the paper running like a pair of ASICS
Used to sport the Gucci Bucks, nigga, no laces
Striped Polo, five-pocket Girbaud
Mama got her tubes tied and rocking dolo
I used to have the starter jacket with the logo

Now, nothing gets cleared without me signing my name
I'm just headlining the game
Won't quit until I'm A-Rod in the game
They riding the bench, they not in the game
I misplaced the key to the lock and chain
My spot remain, like a bleach stain, or cranberry
It's Murder She Wrote like Angela Lansbury
I remember being small, man
New toys when my mom would win the card game
Got my gifts before Christmas—didn't have to wait for them
I had a ten-speeder, scooter, and a skateboard, haha!
Then we moved to the suburbs
Me and lil' Toya Johnson was lovebirds, aww, man!

With the fully-automatic Tec
Thinking 'bout you girl
I was working my juug girl

Uhh, bow-wow-wow, yippie-yo, yippie-yay
Can't trust these dog-ass hoes today
I say bow-wow-wow, yippie-yo, yippie-yay
Can't trust these dog-ass hoes today
But I got one I really fuck with
She makes my heart skip a beat
She dropped her drum stick
Sometimes we fuck forever, sometimes I cum quick
I eat that pussy 'cause it's sweet, as sweet as one-six
Sixteen bullets in a clip, but more than one clip
Shoot a nigga sixteen times until I'm convinced
I got strawberry cocaine as sweet as Fun Dip
You know I keep some nose candy for my young bitch
I love my young bitch
'Cause she don't give me drama
You don't want no drama
My goons waitin' for you, to snap
Like some photo bombers
Yeah we leave a nigga flat
We leave 'em horizontal
And then my lawyer tell your honor
On that morning, I was –

Chilling on the set
With the fully automatic Tec
Thinking 'bout you girl

I was chilling on the corner about to get fucked up
My nigga T got a 40, and he brought two cups
That nigga Mack was chillin', Po was home talkin' on the phone
Lord, it's been such a good-year we need some Armor All
That nigga Hoody on the set, he got his hoodie on
Euro the future, fuck your future, like I'm reading palms
Wayne Chong, chinky eyes like I'm from Vietnam
Got my bitch with chinky eyes like that bitch Nia Long
Lord, I know I do my thing, can’t let my thing do me
Lord, I know I ain’t a Saint, still rep that fleur-de-lis
Lord, just keep Lil Reginae away from birds and bees
Let her be strong as the woman that gave birth to me
Fuck your degree, this murder in the first degree
I got that Tec under my arm like Right Guard, Sure, Degree
Lord, sometimes I just be so gone I be like ""Earth to me?""
I burn some weed, I burp some lean, I served a fiend
While I was

Chilling on the set

While I'm tryna get them demons, out of my demonstration
I'm like fucking right I'm flexing on these pancake ass niggas
These niggas must be nuts, I castrate these niggas (pause)
Then she stuck out her tongue
Well since you act like a dog I'mma fuck you like one
I got this Tec in my draws, and I murder for fun
Man all these niggas the same, it's like we watching re-runs
And I am salt in the wound, I am soap in ya eye
These bitches thinkin' they fly, I tell em' roaches can fly
Even at my low bitch I'm high, I'm tryna stay focused I'm fine
But if I crack one of these niggas like a glow stick he shine
But it's Trukfit: skate or die,
 them bitches wasting my time
And when they ask me where I'm from I say the Great State of Mind
OK that loud got me stanky, that lean got me cranky
They tell me think it over over and I end up over-thinking, agh!

Cause I don't know how fake feel nigga
Cause all my life I've been a real nigga
Yeah all my life I've been a real nigga
Kidnap yo wife, fuck her and still kill her
Yeah and I don't wanna take pills nigga
But it's either that or take chances nigga
Run up on you, click-clack: pay yo taxes nigga

I like her pussy tighter than my fucking schedule
Man I love hitting yo bitch, like a Lucky Seven

Yellowbone pussy, uh lemon squeeze

You faker than yo bitch ass
Weed good, bitch bad
Fat mouth, slim chance
I see you niggas hatin', with ya hatin' ass
I'm just lightin' up, like laser tag
Chopper clips is too long, send you back to where you came from
Yeah, pussy niggas get banged up, I wish you would give a name up

I'm a bad motherfucker, I got this nigga's back

Woah

She say ""Watch these hoes, 'cause they leeches like Robin"" I say, ""No, Robin Givens""
She was sittin' on my lap and you know a nigga strapped, I know she feel it
It's crazy out here, I'm just protecting myself, you know I'm winnin'
She say ""I get it, and if anything was to happen to you, I'd be livid""
""You ain't gotta worry 'bout that, I'll kill a pussy nigga, put his head on exhibit""
Come up missing, think they caught a big fish 'til his body come up drippin'
I treat her legs like like a grand opening, smiling while I cut the ribbon
I took a pill, she took a pill, we was chilling, 20 minutes, now we feel it
She say ""I know you probably hear this shit a lot, but you the shit in my opinion""
I said, ""It never gets old, thought I'd never say never, but I did it

Guess I could fuck her once then I'm out
Fucked so many times a nigga lost count, Lord

Back from the 80's,Dedication 6: Reloaded,2018.0,"I keep the blammer in the drawer with the pajamas
I keep the ammo in the bananas
I keep the standards high as the Canyon
I treat the Grammy's like some medallions
I treat the randoms like some companions
I treat the weed like some azaleas
I got more value than I got failure
I got more flings than I got flair
I don't dream if I do not have nothing to wear
You see what I mean, and that's why you stare
I know you believe, I know you beware
I know she a fiend, and this an affair
If momma a queen, and poppa a bear
You run out of steam, you run out of stairs
I run in Supreme and get something rare
She run to the team, and now she a player
We live on the edge, we die in the air
We sick in the head, but pockets is well
We tiptoe on eggs, we out of our shell
Our vision is red, the eyes are as well
We can't pay attention, we got to pay bills
It doesn't make sense if it's not making mills
We do not take pictures, we're not taking L's
If y'all love to listen, then I hate to tell
If y'all scared to visit, then I take it there
If heaven is real, then y'all fake as hell
Cut off your heels and bounce on your tail
I'm on a mission, survival is real
Man, fuck how I fix it, admire the repairs
I'm talking six but my mind is on twelve
Poppin' prescriptions on top of the hill
Even the devil advised me to chill
I told that nigga, stay out of my hair
She just want to fuck in the throne
Shit get too deep and they dug up your bones
I'm sippin' that Sleep and I'm smoking that Gone
When you reach your peak, we gon' cut off your arms
She sniffin' that King and she mix it with Kong
Her clit got a ring, and my dick got a horn
This is what I call a risk and reward
We cutting it close, give the ninja the sword
Fuck what they think, man these niggas don't know us
This shit is sick and it get in your pores
And then you a corpse, and then it's the morgue
Me, I'ma hustle until it's the Forbes
I swore, it was no more than a chore
The house by the water, condo by the shore
I'm sure, I'm all about that manure
Cooler than leather and hot as velour
I'm not the one, when it is war
I'm on the front until combat is done
And I got your tongue, stomp on it once
Then smile at your young, they see I'm having fun
Shit don't get brazy 'til I say go brazy
Run up on your haven and pop at your nasal
Your baby gon' take me straight down to the basement
Gun to the head, she get down to the basics
No dramatization, we popping these gauges
Even the neighbors gon' feel the vibrations
Behind desperation, it's just in our nature
So cold-hearted, perspiration turn to glaciers
Ovations, better be loud and bodacious
And then I'ma take me a bow and be gracious
Wipe the gun off with my towel
Throw it in the crowd and then take a pow at the spacious
I'm out of my mazes, I'm out of my cages
I'm out of the labels, I'm kind of escapist
I profit, I praise it, I spend it, I save it
I buy me a nation, you renting on Avis
I'm in it, I sit it, I did it, you said it
You killing, you playing, I'm friendly, I'm faded
I get way too high to get through the hiatus
You look in my eyes and my pupils dilated
I'm true to my ratings, I'm glued to my statements
I just want to dive in the pool of my payments
I'm in and outrageous, I'm rippin' out pages
You runnin' your mouth, seein' how quick you can chase it
And then you rephrase it, we stick to invasions
The stick is malicious, equipped with a laser
The temperature blazin', the tension is raisin'
You smell the dead once, gotta live with the fragrance
Sickness is real, the meds is too tasty
Death is related, happy we made it
Keeping it dirty like Sanford and Grady
The Young Mula Baby, I'm back from the 80s
Dedication, sick, shit

My favorite movie quote is ""You got 14 bricks in that bag right there?"" That's my favorite movie quote.

The Sqad pop 'em I'ma fuck with the hottest
Diamonds droppin’ temperature, bitch I'm one of the finest
And to be honest, I got all these hoes stocked up like sinus, now who you fuckin'?
Ice shining colorful, like a sack of fruit or something
With no heart for bitches like ??? or something
I be the true to nothing thorough nigga, young, raw, and famous
Get money 'til I'm dead or 'til the day of my arraigning
Spittin' game through the platinum smile
You can see the fuck I be saying from half a mile
How I hop out of the colossal Tahoe filled up with models
Poppin' bottles with pussy poppers that gobble until they swallow
See I'm a pimp Playboy when it come to these hoes
Cause all I give is cum to these hoes and run from these hoes
I comfortably roll in the latest sleepy eye Mercedes
Heat up for the haters speed up for the ladies
Miss, so watch your back, and watch your mouth cat
Weezy shit, this our click
You 'bout that? I send my Sqad to where your house at
All of a sudden niggas gs, why the fuck is you trippin'?
I cock and shoot up one of your knees, why the fuck is you trippin'?
You listening? I'm official pimpin'
Be lowkey dippin', Range Ro' be twistin' on blades
I'm O. J. Simpson, pretty limpin'
Big fucking cannon, holding me back
With some shit from off the Discovery Channel on my back
My niggas drowned in smoke, underground, pound daily
My hoes like Nelly cause they go ""Down, down baby""
I used to dog chickens, cluck 'em, fuck 'em, and duck 'em
But now I'm more mature, I fuck 'em, fuck 'em, and fuck 'em
Stuck inside of the game for damn near two decades
And I'ma make you see the insides like a x-ray
Aww fuck...
Huh? Drunk off Cris', mami on e
Weezy on e, mami cummin' on me
The diamond long links sparkle, tough in the light
You do a lil' something tonight, I buy you something with ice
And I ain't stunting a price, shawty I can afford it
I been had dough before I was recorded
Started to order you a Mercedes C 240
But I thought it would be more nice for you in a Ferrari, peep me

It's whatever, holla
I ain't stopping, I ain't stopping
Check it, check it

Muhfucka bet' not fuck with this nigga
I'm itching, clutching the trigger
Muhfucka you can end up in a river, shit
I'm like a tornado I’m twisted off of shit
And my pistols off my hip but I give a shit about who I hit, fuck
I'm fucked up, I'll fuck you up for fucking up
Guns up like ""What's up?"", get your fucking guts cut
Tough luck bruh
Wonder why your bitch act stuck up?
Cause the slut got Weezy nuts stuck up in her fucking butt
Yung mack flip crack quicker than acrobats, get at me man
Look call me Wayne a. k. a. Big Daddy Kane
Nigga can't tell me nothing 'bout the game
Been in that deep shit, every year I'm M. V. P
It's just in me
Rims on the 'Lac like 22 inches
Play with me, I open up your back like 22 inches
Guerrilla pimpin'
And it really isn't wise for niggas to start poppin'
At any given time them niggas could start droppin', peep it
I'm off the strip muhfucka what you want?
This a freestyle coming from off the top out the trunk
Niggas be like Mase and go to Church
But I go to the trunk and then I go to your shirt
Holla at me, I'm the don bitch
Look we can get it on bitch
Gotta get another rap to flow on bitch...
Hold up, aight, aight, aight
Listen, playa, all I do is get bread, I'ma head to them cowards
And if they ever try me, I'll bring y'all the head of them cowards
This big spending, see the heads on them dollars
It's big pimpin', you see your bitch lipstick red on my boxers
Choppers pop at any time for any given reason
Leave 'em not breathing under cement for one disagreement
Freedom, we ride on them bitches, rollin' through sittin' high on them inches
My mission's to make sure Squad get expensive
And if anyone of you niggas better get defensive, your care will get intensive
Shot put humps on top of your head like Bart Simpson
I spark instant, now who want it? I'll light your set
Cause I'm all about money cocksucker, my life a check
I'm spectacular, I let the Tec tackle ya
I spit 16 after ya like I rap with y
Put your chest in the back of ya
You would think a truck hit 'em, it's Weezy, don't fuck with him
Better lock me up or get me to the graveyard quick
Come and get me I spray, spark, spit, it's straight war bitch
Niggas is hoes, like they take long dick
I wave chrome shit at home, shit, make domes split
And may I say these fake niggas on some Ray Charles shit, blind to the fact
9 to ya cap, blat, put your mind in your lap
I ride with the gat for hard times, crimes, and rats
It’s rhymes of the crack, my Sqad, I'll die for that
I climb in the 'Lac, drunk off 190 ?
Don't try me cat, I take this shit beyond the rap
And this Ecstasy is why my eyes are black
Don't like baby moms but the X make her thighs look fat
But fuck the bullshit I grind for scratch, I scrape and scruff, bake and cut
You hatin' us? We tape you up
I spin ya corner make you duck from blazin’ bucks
Bandanas, braids, and cuts, I'm gangsta'd up
Muhfucka

Oh, oh shit, oh shit
What they want?
I dont think they want Weezy. Do you think they want Weezy?
Check it, check it

Lil' nigga pass slow in a S 430, ya ho be like ""That's so purty""
Fuck with me I'll show your chest no mercy
Sqad get so dirty, but still we do it clean
Bring action to these fake ass niggas like movie scenes
I pop so much X man I feel like Wolverine
Wake up in the morning, lips burning, can't move my spleen
See this lil' dude is mean, strapped up with tools and things
I'll get you different drugs mixed up like Smoothie King
The heavy platinum jewelry bling over the white tee
Watch your wifey, she's mostly likely to blow me pipey
I'm so exciting
Money, murder, steal, kill, rape
You should do like the Internet and start to Bill Gates
This whole world gon' end up with some bad fucking tumors, listening to these Cash Money rumors
I'll blast, bust, and shoot you, hit your block without the mask, fucking screw you
Treat you like a bitch, bitch look at me while I do you

Ok, ok, homie, ok
Peep it out, Squiddad
Let me catch my breath, let the Danger track roll
And let me holla at you, now let me holla at you, check it out
S-Q-A-D

Don't fool with any niggas like me
We pull triggers like weeds
Swigger off the Piña Colada
Dreams of having cream and the power
You need a problem? I'm the meanest to start with
And got grams the size of the head of Gina on Martin
For any discomfort the Ninas is sparking
Be in your apartment, many assault men and semi-revolvers
Keep it clean, I'm a young Sqad street teen, only into green
If you intervene I'll leave your ass colder than Winter
And y'all just look like bitches
You get fucked then I nut up
And just like bitches, I leave you face down and butt up
Nigga what up? I just bought a record to say fuck Hip-Hop
I spit it for them niggas who grip Glocks
Dip cops, flip rocks, and when the bricks drop
We fix blocks, suddenly watch the income
Fuck with me, watch the outcome
Niggas don't wanna hear the Glock rung

That's that real shit, that's-
K, ok, ok
Yea, holla at me, holla at me

Slide out the shit, cool, frostbit jewels like igloos
See Weezy gets loot, that be why your bitch choose
But dude, I ain't got nothing for her but some dick juice
I stick tools in the pocket of the S. Q. leather
They gon' have to rescue this fella if he stress my pleasure
I tells you once, I'm the don, you can trust my word
I say with a Herpes dick, nigga fuck the world
I be with niggas that could get me years
I be with hoes and bitches that favor Britney Spears
Listen here, you see the Sqad Minked up, Platinum S. Q. linked up
With a freak that drink nut ‘til my dick shrink up
You think it's soft? Let the thing bust 'til I'm seeing pink guts
Niggas watch them pigs come, they trying to sink us
You know who I be, Weezy Wee muhfucka
I ain't gon' stop the flow until the end
K we got a new game, I'm running, punting, I ain't passing the ball
You other niggas just be crashing the boards
With a team full of great players, but I'm a veteran, all-star
And let's be real man, I'm better than all y'all
I'm the truth, I'm the reason, I'm the meaning, I'm the shit
I'm the alleged convict in any Sqad incident
Last name Carter like Vince and shit
But I don't slam balls and goals, my life's money, cars, and hoes
Cadillac white walls and 'Bauds, pimpin' partna
Plus I can get more work out than a fitness doctor
Let's get this partna, I'm the young don these niggas honor
And those of you who ain't cheap can't buy a vowel
It's cause the child's mom will eat me up like Jeffery Dahmer
Libel to find my condom inside of dry vagina
I'm kinda calm, drama goes with my persona
A minor with intentions to harm ya, holla

Ok, ok
Switch it up right here, switch it up, switch it up
Listen, listen, take this money, make this money, get this money
Puff holla at me

Homeboy it's Sqad shit

Blast 'em, watch em stop, drop, and roll like they firemen
Seriously man, I got enough money to buy ya men
Turn 'em against you and make 'em kill ya mom and them, don't fuck with me
Buck 50 on the dash of the box but that's only approximately cause it really do like two ?, blue fire
Wrist looking like blue fire
Piña Colada got me spiked like barb wire, Weezy Wee, Sqad rider
Holla at me, you know you know me

Blow me some dro, nah I ain't smoking I stopped that

Oh shit, I ain't finished

Get down or you dying, niggas tote iron
Got that coke flying like birds, not the ones with feathers, I'm talkin' weight like birds
And you might get served if it’s proper enough
Or find your nerves on the curb if you a cop or something
A baller blocker or something, I'll send your noggin a hundred
Have the whole block sprinting, dashing, jogging, and running
Type of life I live, Gotti would love it
Sqad property buddy, some young niggas with a mafia budget
Can't nobody put nobody above it
And if they do, they find they body with your body above it
Fuck it, let's take it public, nah leave it the gutter
Fuck it, let's go and dump 'em, nah leave 'em in the gutter

But I'm like Iverson dawg, I be ballin' but very street
Keep my name out your yapper, or you gon' have to try to keep my flame out your cappa
I ride around with like two bodies framed on the clapper
The tool cocked for he, do pop for beef, move out for chiefs
Supply two blocks a piece two blocks a piece
My crew watch for cheese and I do stock my cheese

Dude, dude, who you know fucking with me man?
Check it, check it

What up world? This here your people Weezy, holla at the don
Real nigga dude, I promise that to God
When I swallow half the Dom I go loco, stressed, hoping I'm not cursed
Walk around with TECs poking out my shirt
Niggas show off for them hoes, try play hard, with they chest poking out they shirt
Try me and I send shots, leave they chest poking out they shirt
Yes, expect the worst when you fuck with the Squad right
Pull you out your car at a stoplight
Catch you in the waist, make you my height
This shit's not nice, I'll have you chopped twice for a hot price
Or I can take off my ice and hit your block and stop life
Can you see that?
Properly under my seat is where the heat at
Directly in your head is where the bullets meet at
I be that cat who make sure my Sqad ball gracious, 'til the Lord take us

My real father is a ho, my attitude is fuck pops
I'm living it up in a nice home, riding in trucks, tough drops
And I'm a young nigga, I don't even know how to do the bus stop
But I got my money right
When I hit the club, make it a sunny night
See the fake flossers, bum ballers, is a funny sight
Watching dudes front for these hoes in they Chevy right?
Pull up next to 'em in a 500 bumpin' Betty Wright
Keep my shit spaghetti tight
Playboy put the hood on that
We buy sports cars and put the fuckin' hood on that
My bank got too hot to sit on so I stood on that
Any place, you be careful cause I could own that

Fee Fee Favorite

Flippin' in a whippa
Peel the top back like a zipper
Skippin' on them chrome dip slippers
Rippin' on the lips of a stripper
If that's your bitch mister don't kiss her
If so you might as well kiss a pistol
Cause all I do is shoot off in her whistler
She finna get my name on her shitter
And I ain't even hit her
My nigga Fat did her, and slid her to the rest of the Squidda
Forget her, another bitch just paged in
Weezy blazing, come through in something amazing
I ball so good I need a sports agent
Look at me and squint your eyes like Asains, what's wrong?
My jewelry's like a white boy, always stoned

Homie I go hard, push a whip with no hair on its head
So all I'm feeling is air on my head
With some ho that you might know, she sucking all the air out my head
Meet you close to knock you square out your head
Sip the Cris’ to clear out my head and try to get my loot up
In Cuba with a translator ?? coke newer
Plus the prices is cooler
I come back through the hood with that dirty
And tell 'em I'm like Tiger Woods, all I got is birdies
Got bitches in they 30s calling Weezy poppa
But Weezy not daddy bitch, cause Weezy in and out ya
Weezy never spouse ya, Weezy give shit about ya
And Weezy don't Master Suite, Weezy living room couch ya
How about you be a good bitch, and take these pies I just cooked up
And tape 'em to the pelvis, arm or your thighs

But a main focus to remain focused, they ain't focused, muhfucka

Holla, shit, holla, oh shit, oh shit
Boy, boy, boy
Ok

I spit it for them niggas who run the corner, palm the revolver with honor
Any beefs involving homie, your momma
Homie we swarm out the Eddie Bauer, thoughts to devour
Spark and shower, we get more stupid than Austin Powers
Smell the aroma of marijuana, Coronas when upon us
We do just what the neighborhood have shown us
We murder opponents and don't think about it, forget about it
Niggas won't do shit about it
Wave the pistol, get the bitch up out 'em
I'm off the hinges, 
chicks on my dick, proper than Cindy Crawford
Any problems I pop the chopper and knock the appendix out him
Hit the block with bricks of powder
What you know 'bout doing that?
And splitting a key with flour, making it two in fact
Dawg I'm all street, if you want Hip-Hop, here's what I give you instead
I'll make you hip out when them fuckin' bullets dig in your leg
Positive niggas talking spooky, y'all ain't scaring nobody
Y'all love Mos Def, I love fucking John Gotti, holla

Yeah, yeah, yeah

I wish that there was no taxes, no cases, no police, and no racists
No rapists, wish they had a 700 Mercedes
Wish my Sqad live happy
I wish my kids grow stronger than me
I wish my momma live longer than me
I wish the cops stay off the corner this week
I wish the gutta, ghetto neighborhood hunger would cease
I wish them niggas who ain't got shit would stop hating on niggas who got shit
And you know I wish for Pun, Biggie, and Pac shit
I wish that I could get high but when I'm high I wish I wouldn't get high
Sometimes I wish I wasn't alive
I wish for Heaven gates to enter
Wish for Lakers' tickets at the Staples Center
My seats, floor me
Wish Chris Childs wouldn't of hit Kobe
When I see Lauren, I wish I knew why my heart burns
Wish 22 inch rims wouldn't rub on sharp turns
I wish these hoes stop lying

Wish dope heads stop using, as if they not dying

Fuck it. That's just some shit I wish for, fuck it
Aight. That what you want?

Fuck, I wish I ain't have a jail record
Wish every bitch gave head

I wish I make money 'til I'm a dead man
I wish my chain wasn't heavy around my neck
Wish hoes wouldn't suck dick and try to kiss down my neck
Wish I ain't have to get locked up for slapping her to the ground for that
Bitch I wish you wouldn't wanna be down for that

Guzzled Belvedere ever since we heard Jay
Be dying the worst way
Who want it? Your bitch, you
Sqad is the official shit
Pistols spit behind little shit

Die for respect and hope, look beyond I’m a celebrity
Hold minds for ransom, head sold separately
I’m a ape dawg
Trapped in the jungle, can’t escape dawg
But I bet you be the last man standing like a 8-ball
And I ain’t worrying ‘bout ballin’ no more, I’m past that stage

We peace nothing cousin, this here is war and we battle
Big guns with deep barrels, bullets leap and leap at you nigga

I’m sorry
What the fuck is “find him dest”?
I meant, “If someone frontin’ you find his death”
Death

Holla at us, check it

Pistols burning
Pop the barrel, turning
It got the faggots squirming
We closing any open shop we ain’t concerned in
Coke the size of Sherman Klump we flipped and doubled
And dropped the whip on dubs and dipped in Bubble
Get a bad bitch to hustle and move product
And split them niggas quick as fuck if them dudes try her
Not behind the ho, but only behind the dough
And behind the dough I kill whoever stand behind the door
You ain’t tryna go that route with the Sqad, it’s rough, I promise
We kidnap your mommas and sit our johnsons on her tonsils
We reside inside the S. Q. bombers
And we leave families emotional like Carl Thomas
So stay from ‘round us
And to be honest, ain’t nothing for me to do away with you
I be the same nigga that blow a Tre with you
Then let a K hit you
Fuck you nigga, I ain’t got no love for none of y’all

I speak from the shit that bleed on the left side of my chest
Take heed to the shit that gleam on the left side of my waist
Or take three to the left side of your face
A multiplatinum artist still riding with TECs and 3-8s
A hustler, you can see the crack residue left on them plates
They fucking with me, I’m predicting death on them snakes
I ride in a frenzy
Ride in a Benzy
Fuck it, tryna fire my enemies
Fire a sack, recline back, and feel me

And clocks with beams cocked and fuck with me - seeing doctors
The Sqad be in monster trucks with screens and bobbers
Passing green and brown chocolate like John Stockton
Who stopping these lil’ niggas? Nobody, it’s impossible
Find me in a Benz – aqua blue
Rims colossal dude
And right under the seat’s a Glock or two
Don’t make me pop at you
And got two Hawaiian tropical bitches that will swallow you
People ask me “Weezy, why you do it so big?”
I pop my collar, drop the roof off the 6, then shoot up the bridge
Listen, I’ve had loot since a kid
I ain’t just start having dough
As a matter of fact, I started having dough
I’ma be fancy, send some warnings at folks

Unleash this pop one in your bitch Victoria Secre-
‘Atures creepin’ without the lights on
Doo rag, G Nikes on
Hope the choir sing your ass a nice song
Niggas ain’t tryna collide with the Squiddad

Pull out, cock, pop moms
Drop bombs

Have you parents in the front emergency room pacing
Crying an waiting for the doctor to come out and say

*Moans* all y’all better know no disrespecting Weez’
Come to your fucking street and kill families

Infected with a raw disease, call it H. I. V
That stands for Hoes, Incoming Violence
That’s what I die with
I pop shit, don’t fuck with Sqad shit
We on some mob shit
Some lil’ niggas who seem harmless, but nah bitch
Glocks spit behind anything
Bitch lick anything
‘Cause I got plenty change like Bill Gates’ piggy bank
Got a young pretty thing sitting beside me in the whip
With Limo tints to hide me in the whip
Told mami you can keep your clothes on, I wan’ see where your head at
In other words I don’t wanna fuck, I wan’ see where your head at
You can catch me laid back in the cut with ounces and bundles
Bouncing from hustles, doubt me I’ll fuck you, fuck it
Lounging in bubble
Rocky watch resemble mountains or something
Fronting get your body found behind some mountains or sum’n
Aye, when you fuckin’ with me you fuckin’ with cheese
You fuckin’ with Streets, you fuckin’ with heat
You fuckin’ with Sqad, you fuckin’ for free
You touching your knees
And if you hate, you’ll be lucky to breathe
Now how you like lookin’?
When the double gauge is ???? you get your fuckin’ life token
Despite the business, fuck rap
Picture block on a motorcycle wheeling
But the Glock ain’t right for kidneys
I don’t like you bitches, I hate you hoes
Date you hoes, bust nuts in your facials hoes
Then replace you hoes, that’s the type of shit that makes you hoes
All the women in this nation hoes
Hot since my creation woa’
Who the fuck want him?
Bitch niggas with no nuts on ‘em
I got pistols with blood on ‘em

Niggas with chips and drugs on ‘em
Got bitches with hips and tits on ‘em
Lips with dicks on ‘em
Chicks with bricks on ‘em
Chicks with chicks on ‘em
I’m big shit homie, wide body chrome 6
Get dome while driving home, shit, shit, shit

Holla at me, I’m still not done
Holla at me, check it, I’m still not done
Nigga holla at me, holla at me
Listen, listen, listen

Don’t get it twisted ‘cause I’m younger than most
I come with the toast
Get it hot like summer was close
I’m hanging out the Hummer with Sos’
Exploding missile Glock ringing at the front of your door like Jehovah Witness’
Sober? Forget it
This C. M. B. thing, I’m over committed
The youngest soldier come with it
Cock back, guns put holes in your fitted
Nigga I told you to quit it
I load it with 50
I blow ‘til it’s empty
The dro and Henny got me lokin’ and limpin’
Ropin’ up when I drink ‘til I’m over the limit
Hoppin’ out the Rover with Semis
Wildin’ out, go straight to your momma’s house
With a rag on my face with more 9s than dialing out
Now who hating?
Niggas cheapskating, underestimating
The heat take him, put him under extra pavement
Some one week in Jamaica, come back with a accent like -

Whoo, whoo, fuck it
That’s 10000 bars for y’all bitches
Holla at me

My flow is retarded, I think I got a birth defect
Highway to heaven Bow! Where the fuck the chauffeur at?
These niggas softer than the pillows on my sofa set
I'm fighting myself cause I don't see no competition
I don't write, I draw that pistol make your face a composition
So please walk away before we stomp your ass
Everyday is halloween and you can get your pumpkin smashed
The ones you think your friends is really your haters
So just do me a favor.. and don't do me no favor
All I need is a blunt and a cup of purple
I put this together, I could've been a construction worker
Niggas looking funny, well I'm just getting blunted
And everybody's wondering if I'm really with Young Money
Well is a pig's pussy pork? Do bears be shittin'
In the woods and wipe they ass with a rabbit when they finish?
Turn my swagger super mean but my bitches bad too
And my flag bright red but Lortab blue, Oop!
Isn't it ironic I tell Tunechi pass the chronic
Purple syrup, yellow Fanta, you can call it Magic Johnson

Gone off the shrooms, I'm stoned like tomb
Bitch, I do what I do like the groom
Looking death in the eyes, kissing fear on the lips
I'm so faded my nigga I'm 'bout to disappear in this bitch
Like poof, there go my roof
Pow, there go my hammer
Come around here stuntin', get jacked like O'Lantern
Two times for them haters, head shots for them snitches
If the best things in life are free then why the fuck we pay attention?
Uh, pockets on nine-months, I go dumber than a dunce
Too many pills, too many blunts
Two bitches named such-and-such
It's Young Money we out chea, we turnt up 'bout that life
My pockets fat like Jack Black - If I go broke, I'mma jack whites
My bitch bad as fuck nigga, my goons 'bout that trigger play
Murk one of these soft niggas, now I'm in court for a pillow case
This is the magic show but Tune ain't no trick ho
Fuck niggas no Chris Stokes, it's me, Flow, D4
Fishtailing out the parking lot like salmon
She swallowed all my kids, bitch we could of had a family
The way I make the purp disappear, straight vanish
Smoke fire, spit fire
Puff the magic dragon

Funny how the heater make a nigga freeze up
We smoke a tree down til it's just a tree stump
That Eastside nigga, bang on you bitches
I'm going at your neck, strangle you bitches
Got a long-ass list full of bad-ass bitches
And I stay burned out like a bad transmission
I'm on, like the lights I light up
The kush, knock out, Tyson fight
I'm talking about ass and titties, Sex and the City
Weezy F Baby and the 'F' is for ""forget it""
I'm loving my shine, sipping on fine wine
Up in some fine dime, then she give me Einstein
Young Money motherfucker, yeah we picked a fine time
I'm a 17 nigga. Bitch, I don't mind dying, man
I just ended up on every bitch's sex list
Genie in the bottle, get a muthafuckin' deathwish
Thugga in this bitch, he say fuck y'all niggas
Breaking buds down the size of a football nigga
Red beam, gimme the light, no Sean Paul nigga
Let Nina bust in your face like a porn star nigga
Yeah I keep a Brian Pumper, no homo
The shit I'm on got the world moving in slow-mo
Man, I told Mack I was gonna do it
Above the law, but under the influence
Man, I was on the skateboard, kick push swagger
Got my girl to the room, got behind her like a shadow
I had her ass up in the air
I swear I got, I swear I got the largest clip in the world
Right here in my gat
And I wish a nigga play
I'mma bust a nigga ass

I still dick her right down, hit her with the pipe bomb

Waiting for the chance to get to tell her
I'm the one she should be with
She's popular wit all the guys, so innocent in my eyes
I can see her in my life, she woulda had the world if she were mine
But see, she had other plans, I couldn't understand
Her and her stupid friends, Varsity's biggest fans
Never forget the day she laughed and walked away
And I couldn't stop her, I guess she had it all

She had it all figured out when she left me with a broken heart
Fucked around and turned me down
'Cause she didn't think I could play the part
But now the prom queen, the prom queen

See you never know how
How everything can turn around

When they can hardly remember her name

She finds herself alone, askin' herself, where did she go wrong
She didn't realize she chased the type of guys
That don't believe in ties, tryin' to apologize

Shoot a nigga on his porch and make him fall in his kitchen
Copped a big-boy Porsche with all the specifics
And I keep that torch, baby, call me Olympics
Red, white, blue pill, 
flip my skills like gymnasts
And never give a bitch money, blood or kidneys
When the gun goes pow, I be at the finish
With my medal round my neck, autograph on my tennis

Never talk to those that sat on the benches

I’m here to distinguish the bears from the penguins
Life is just a gap—get some money in between it
Glocks like police, pumps like Finas
This beat getting totaled, Pam, Keisha, Kima
Sitting on the world, thinking 'bout a girl
Pistol on my side, paint you like a mural
Digged in my pocket, pulled out a party
Be cool 'fore you get stomped and pulled out the party

Looking for a bad bitch, I give her dinosaur dick
Big, bad flow Weezy, fuck the polices
Church, like a choir and a couple of old priests
Elevator in my crib 'cause it's five floors
I'm not expecting you to have one inside yours
Vince Young, suicide doors

Got shit I need to work on, a nigga been workin'
I know you uncertain
You ride for me and I drive you crazy and I know I've been swervin'
I know you've been nervous, I know I've been reckless
And now you all heartless, and now it's all worthless
I don't deserve ya, you don't deserve this
I turned a blessing into a burden
I'm really sorry, I know it don't fix it
A nigga been wishin' that I could reverse it
I know it don't help it, I know I look selfish
And looks are deceiving, but you lookin' further
And you lookin' past me, I'm just a has-been
How did this happen? What is the current? Where's your endurance?
You actin' like you've never been in love, like you just a tourist
Shit was the purest 'til you got curious
You know that love don't come with insurance
I blame the jurists who put me on trial
They was sick of your smile, now we just cured 'em
That got me furious, people that knew of us
Tell me they sorry, I said that make two of us
Wonder what ruined 'em
Wonder how beautiful you look at your wedding when I'm at my funeral, goddamn

(
Love me or leave me
)
Love me or leave me
(
Let me go my own way

She love me or leave me
I gave her a reason, she don't want a reason
She don't wanna see me, she don't wan' believe me
I tell her that's cold, I'm already freezin', my heart ain't even beatin'
Just talked to the reaper, he put me on speaker, he told me to keep ya
So I tried to call, but I couldn't reach ya, you blocked my number
I feel like James Harden, you blocked my jumper, goddamn

Who you lovin', who you wanna be fuckin'?
Since it ain't me, just tell lil' homie he lucky, I'm lonely for nothing
I'm starin' at the phone and the button to call 'em to come in
I'm starin' at the walls, I been punchin' these walls, did me nothin'
I'm thinkin' 'bout the ball I've been fumblin' when stars were abundant
Then shit happened, and all of the sudden the toilet start flushing
Try to avoid the confrontin', enjoy the consumption
With outside noise and seduction, it's harder to function
Look up at the angels, they hoverin', they show me the light
They told me that I know that I'm wrong, but I don't know what's right, goddamn

(
Love me
), you must hate me (
Or leave me
)
Love me or leave me
(
Let me go my own way
)

She love me or leave me
I gave her a reason, she don't want a reason
She don't wanna see me, she don't wan' believe me
I tell her that's cold, I'm already freezin', my heart ain't even beatin'
Just talked to the reaper, he put me on speaker, he told me to keep ya
So I tried to call, but I couldn't reach ya, you blocked my number

Way I’m Ballin’,Dedication 5,2013.0,"I got shotguns under my staircase
Rob yo ho ass bare face
Been had this bitch on lock, I’m bout to get this bitch a cellmate
All my life I been this cold
All my nights I spend with hoes
I keep change on me now
‘Cus this shit’s startin to take a toll
I just flew 2 hoes in, oh how time flies, clip its wings
Make you spit that safe combination, out like Listerine
And even though I’m not an artist this is where I draw the line
We don’t feel none of you niggas
Y'all some fuckin porcupines
I still got residue all on my dinner plates
Real niggas in my inner circle
None of my checks come late, I ain’t having that, I give em curfews
Dressed up like a old lady, uzi under my church dress
Surprise yo ass like a baby… taking his first steps
I’m too good for just any bad bitch
Smoke like I’ve been kissing dragons
That milk carton show her missing panties
That pussy felt like a hidden valley
Thank God that I’m so gifted
I wouldn’t return a single gift
But all good things must come to an end
Like this blunt burning my fingertips
Lil' Tune

This ain’t what you want
Put that gun to yo ho head
Make her tell me what you don’t
Got some moon rocks in my pockets,
 
that’s a pocket full of stones
Fuck with me cuz I fuck around and got that shit from Neil Armstrong aw!
Neil Armstrong aw! Neil Armstrong
Fuck with me cuz I fuck around and got that shit from Neil Armstrong!
Got some moon rocks in my pockets, that’s a pocket full of stones
Fuck with me cuz I fuck around and got that shit from Neil Armstrong aw!

I pour up a lot, I pour up a lot
Me and my niggas, we go up a lot
We so up, you not
D'usse, D'usse, when I get home I'mma throw up these shots
When I got home I was so drunk I knocked
So drunk I knocked and the door was unlocked
Went in the kitchen and grabbed me a pop
Got my codeine and I poured up a lot
I pour up a lot

I pour up a lot
I got more than a doc, my soda gonna pop
Strong as boulders and rocks
My shoulders gon' drop, you know I know I'm so high
I could have swore I saw Pac
Could have swore I saw Spock
My motor don't stop
I stay on my feet, no hole in my socks
You know I'm on deck, when there's snow, I'm on top
I'm stored up on stock
I'm way up, but I'm sure you're not shocked
Cause you know how I rock
And you know that it's cocked
The .44 with the dot
I'm a pro with the Glock, don't you go to the cops
Or your throat gon' get chopped
Then your folks gon' get got then your ho gon' get shot
Kiss that ho if she hot
Hitting notes on my cock like Do Re Mi Fa
And all you lookin' ass niggas look at me now
I'm sure you gon' watch, you boring, I'm not
I'm scoring a lot, ignoring the thots
I'm pouring a lot, taste like euphoria, uh
Russian AK, do what I say and nobody die
I open the soda, I get the codeine and I pour up a lot
I pour up a lot
I sew up the block, make you go off the block
I'm getting twisted with 2 bad bitches in my bedroom
Leave them hoes in a knot
Stomach in knots, thought I need some drank
I'm stuck in my bed and the dopeman said all he got is red
If I don't do red, Lord, I don't do red
I don't do yellow, no, I don't do that
I don't do Qualitest, I don't do Hi-Tech
I need that Act
I don't do yellow cause it make me scratch
As soon as I seen niggas sippin' green
I was like, ""where they do that""
Bring that shit back, let me bring this shit back

Chinese AK do what I say and nobody die
My soda so dirty, I can't even lie
When I need peace of mind I just pour up a lot
I pour up a lot
Me and my niggas, we go up a lot
We so up, you not
D'usse, D'usse, when I get home, I'ma throw up these shots
When I got home I was so drunk I knocked
So drunk I knocked and the door was unlocked
Went to the kitchen and grabbed me a pop
Didn't even measure, just poured up a lot
I pour up a lot

I run in your building and hold up the spot
Give me what you got, the keys and the gwuap
Make everyone get on their knees and then count
My bitch talking 'bout kicking me out
Cause every time she want the soda we out
Bitch, I don't want no lip, I just want some mouth
I just want a sip, I don't wanna drown
I just want the lean, I don't wanna bounce
I just wanna chill, I don't want a crowd
I just want my check, I don't want a trial
I just want some neck, I don't want no mouth
She just wanna love, I just want lounge
I just smoke loud, she just drink brown
I just drink purple, she just smoke hookah
Quit cigarettes, concerned ‘bout her future
I pour up a lot, past, present, future
Syrup and sprite, turn that shit fuschia
Hawaiian Punch, Alo-hallelujah
We got that white girl workin' like Hooters
My shooters don't listen
I tell 'em you cool, but still they don't listen
I cut on the news, and they say you missin'
And I can't stop grinnin' like, ""nigga, we did it""
And they show police fishin'
And searching under bridges when they say no witness
I start hopping around like Jiminy Cricket
And I can't stop sippin'
And she can't stop stripping
Cause she got an infant and her man in prison
Lord, she can't stop ventin'
And I can't stop drifting, she worry a lot

Cream  soda, Sprite, Seven-Up
Fuck it, here we go again
Medicine, medicine, yeah

It can be room temperature or lukewarm
All I need is ice to make the perfect storm

Hood boss, what's up?
6, 6, 6
 (Gangsta Grizz-ills!)

Big body on brabus, that's all I know
Big shotties in the closet, that's all I wore
Screaming ""money over power,"" quote, un-quote
And if the bread get too low, kidnap John Doe (Hold up)

I just fucked your bitch in some Young Money flip flops
I'm smoking on that loud and you can hear a pin drop (Hold up)
I just kissed my bitch and I left codeine in her mouth (Yeah)
Swimming in my money, I smell chlorine when I count (Get 'em)

Skating and mating, I'm spinning like Daytons
I'm winning like Peyton, I'm Christian like Laettner
I'm putting some straightener into all of these Satans
I'm wilder than Nathan, Goliath on David
I'm quietly waiting, I'm trying to be patient
But they want me to wait for Simon to say it
But I am too faded, so talk to my agent
Or they talk about you to your congregation
Man, no conversation or negotiation
No affiliation by association
I need confirmation for my compensation
Or we make a corpse out of your corporation
I need my donation, take drugs in rotation
That AK gon' sound like a standing ovation
They landing your facial, bandanna, rosacea
I'm all about numbers, comparisons, ratios
Collateral, collateral
Xanax and Adderall got me unparalleled
Me and your bitch compatible
Go together like a parachute and a ""geronimo""
This dick is mechanical
But he get too casual up in the vaginal
I pop a Viag-a-ra, she hop like a kangaroo
Suck like a snaggle-tooth
I ain't got time for no rumors
When I am not human, or you men, I'm booming
I'm fucking her, fucking her roomie
I'm platinum versus aluminum, I'm shrooming
I visualize what I'm assuming, my vision is gloomy
But fuck it, I zoom in and now I see movement
And I'd like to thank all the niggas that schooled me
But I still might shoot up my class reunion
I'm sipping that Houston like it's communion
Smoking some weed, bright as a petunia
I'm walking around Miss America
Like I'm the King, King of Zamunda
Been hanging around with my shooters
When you was still hanging out with Mr. Cooper
Which one of you niggas want beef?
I'm putting your name all inside the chalupa
Money since the Mayans, thuggin' since the riots
Six, exemplifyin', higher than Orion
Lion off the diet, eat the whole safari
Pop a cork or body, keep it soft and sour
Watch the market tower
Find a wooden counter, knock on it twice and count 'em
Competition, clown 'em, opposition chowder
Watch the bitches shower, optimistic mama
Common sense ain't common, top position scholar
So far from the bottom, they can't hear me holler
All I say is our, all I say is our, our father
My lil' bae a model, pussy taste like cobbler
Make me ""As-salamu alaykum"" about her
What more can I say about her? Pray about it
I just race the 'Rari, left it way behind me, taste the mileage
Loud-ass blatant diamonds, I think they the loudest
Waking zombies
Break a face or promise, give me steak lasagna, hate your honor
Still my mama's baby; and my baby mamas, they some riders
Can't deflate them tires, I'm still chasing commas
Nigga I made Big Tymers
And I'm still taking time to make it timeless
Dedication problems
Sick shit, ayy, yeah, yeah, yeah...

The nicest thing a fan can say to me when they approach me on the street is any fucking thing true, anything real. You know what I mean, that's the nicest thing. I mean like, even if its cliché, cliché I can still tell when that cliché was straight from your heart and that's all you could think about, all you could think to say when you saw me or if you meant it, like even if it's that, like I said just when it's real. You know why? 'Cause sometimes people can say things that's so real to them that they don't even know that, you know what I mean, some of the things they are saying isn't fact, you know what I mean, official. But you know, things like so what I mean like example: you might walk up on somebody, I might walk up on somebody on the street and they might, uh, they might... shout out the valet from today, umm well yesterday, shout out the valet from yesterday, before you opened the door of my car, you're looking in my eyes, you're a young cat too, you look me in the eyes and you say ahh, and he couldn't, his English wasn't all that, he said: I like the new album, I really like the new project, and I said to him I was like thank you man, he meant that, 'cause he looked me in my eyes and he even opened my door before he said it, you know what I mean, so I was like damn you know when I got in the car I was like damn it's not a project. You know what I mean I don't even consider that, it's damn sure not an album just a mixtape, you know what I mean, but to him that was real, that shit was real, could be a project not an album, so shout out to homie.

Brand new coupe
Driving crazy than a mother
Sittin' low in the seats
With the burner sittin' under
Got my tank top, top down
It probably ain't summer
But I ride like that 'cause I'm hotter than the others
Damn, there's no keeping up with the brother man
I could spell my name in burnt rubber
I'm gone!  Leave me alone
Now the dog is at supper
You could wash my plate and put it back in the cupboard
Ahem, I'm so far ahead of them suckers
I'mma have to start rappin' in numbers
I promise, the flows don't stop
They come rapid like thunder
I bet you hide under your covers

Riding 'round the city
With some brand new heat
Brand new car
Brand new feet
Brand new seats
Brand new smell
Put out the roach
Light a brand new L
Fuck you bitch

Where the fuck is Robin Leach when you need him?
A rich nigga can't even buy freedom
That's why I give my white bitches everything but freedom
I do my white bitches anything but beat 'em
And if they like rat poison, then I'mma feed 'em
I'm sophisticated, fresh from Antarctica my wrist just made it
I'm rich bitch, I ain't broke no more
But I will still chop you up and feed your ass to the poor

Cream,Dedication 5,2013.0,"Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M get the money
Dollar, dollar bill y'all

I've been having these nightmares of losing time, with no reward
Momma would call the Lord, before she call the law
Then I went and found time in a Audemars
Time is money, so I spent it all trying to order more
They say beef is a poor man's sport
Behind the money, get that rhyme report, fuck it


Uh, I don't cut the work, droptop on 20's
Soon as I learned how to talk I talked business
Nigga's ain't safe, all 9 innings
And to you it's just change, I want every JC Penney
And I walk up in your funeral late, suit rented
Lift a mini skirt, get behind her like Benny
Goin' at your neck, get the rope, tie a noose
This a gut check, now who do I write it to?
I'm dirty like ENT, shout out to Murphy Lee
Gotta cut up the credit cards, plastic surgery
I'm a God, mercy me, I'm higher than Mercury
Smokin' on that strong, full of that Hercules
Bartender, hurry up, hurry up with my drink
Niggas pullin capers like they come with a string
I'm standing over the stove with my gun in the sink
Cause I don't know what niggas thinkin, but I know how they think
Uh, catch a skateboard to the jaw
I'm in that pussy, she in awe
And this here is my homeboy, Quick Draw McGraw
I'm even on both sides of the seesaw
You can get your head cut off with a saw, yeehaw
Kill you and your right-hand man, southpaw
Money over bitches, and above the law
Money over bitches, and above the law, money


Uh, pocket full of money, with a posse full of hitters
Black and white Porsches, like a Nazi with a nigga
Money make the world, 360
We throw them dollars up, them bitches better be Frisbees
Pounds in the freezer, 50 rounds in the sweeper
Counter full of coke, naked bitch baggin' up
And if the bitch stealing, I know where her Mama live
I love this shit so much, I got on a tux
Man, it's been a minute since I seen my nigga Bubba
Some niggas fade away, some niggas hit the jumper
Kidnap your niece, don't cry, call your uncle
We don't wanna hurt ya, baby, we just want your uncle
25 lighters on the dresser, yessir
I ain't hearin' that bullshit, I'm deafer than Leppard
Somewhere out wherever, they find your body severed
You know they findin' niggas guilty like they finding treasure
But get your money on occasions, I get too wasted
It's an occasion
I heard a nurse say, ""Thank you for being so patient""
I know my nigga's got me, we good forever
Get the cheese nigga, please, avoid the shredder
Turning good to better, gotta pull it together
I wish that blood on the floor, was rose petals
Real gangstas die of old age
And old money, get paid, my nigga, Tunechi",https://genius.com/Lil-wayne-cream-lyrics

Ooh girl, I love you so
Good lord almighty, I’m in love with a whitey
I call her Aphrodite, I call her when I need her
And she give me good love til my nose start bleeding
Life is just like moving mountains
When I can’t cope, I’m hittin’ that slope
That great white hope, and it ain't no pressure
I can’t feel nothing, but I never felt better
Hmm, but you were just no good for me
Killin’ me softly, that girl is poison
Huh, I had to let you go, take things slow
Just so you know

I’ll do it all again if I had the chance
Don’t feel the pain (don’t feel the pain)
Like novacane (like novacane)
I’ll take the whole world on, I’m feeling so strong
Don’t feel the pain (don’t feel the pain)
Like novacane (like novacane)

You used to make me feel so good
Like I was on top of the World
Sorry I gotta stay away from ya
But that's what the doctor prefered
My Friends told me leave you alone
And I just told 'em leave me alone
It's sad our thing had to end
The relationship was short and sweet, Nia Long
And I see her in the streets
But I can't bring her home
Man, I was on her line all day, no phone
Hah. No Arm & Hammer in my Tony Montana
And truth is...

I’ll do it all again if I had the chance
Don’t feel the pain (don’t feel the pain)

I’ll take the whole world on, I’m feeling so strong
Don’t feel the pain (don’t feel the pain)
Like novacane (like novacane)
Like novacane

Sweet sugar hill, yeah I used to climb her
I never imagined she'd turn out to be but a cheap thrill
That sweet turned to sour, she gave me power
The world was ours
I used to feel invincible on that flour
But I had to change, Yeah, I had to change
So I left it for a bitch named Mary Jane
Now everything's cool, everything's fine
Girl, I'm moving on, I left you behind
Every now and then you pop up on my mind
I might fuck you one last time, cause

I’ll do it all again if I had the chance
Don’t feel the pain (don’t feel the pain)
Like novacane (like novacane)
I’ll take the whole world on, I’m feeling so strong
Don’t feel the pain (don’t feel the pain)

And we'll be round ya all day 'til we ""400 Degreez""
And you see when it get dark, nobody be on the porch

A fistful of dollars
A list full of problems

Yeah I'm from New Orleans
The Creole cockpit
We so out of it
Zero tolerance
Gangsta gumbo, I'll serve 'em a pot of it
I'm wealthy, still fucking with that block shit
Wet your ass up, head to feet, 'til your socks drip
Don't slip, you might fall and bust your ass
No snakes at the Carter
Tell the gardener cut the grass
I hear 'em, but they talking under masks
Stop throwing pebbles at a bulletproof glass
That's Cash Money honey pie
We ain't running, we don't hide
Screaming ""Fuck the other side""
Don't get caught on it
This the deadliest grinds
I put your heart on it
And walk on it
The chalk's only for the art, homie
How they trace ya
After I erase ya?
Look around
We at war
And you still in preparation
I'm riding for them reparations
No patience
Slow paper
Is better than no paper
Fast money don't last too long
You got to pace it
You got to know that paper
If you got it from a caper
Got to blow that paper
Got to know that

No Kodak moments

I don't do too much posing, got a cool killer look

Get your career took
I'm back, like a brassiere hook
Bitch, cheer
Camouflage gear
The hunter's here
Better play it by ear
You ain't nothing but a deer
Around here
And this here is Tha Carter
Serve it while it's hot
Out the pot to your mama
And Slim tell me ain't nobody hotter
But get your boy some dipping sauce
I want the whole enchilada
I got 'em by the collar
Watch me drop 'em
On the head, at the bottom
And you ain't got to shoot 'em
'Cause I already shot 'em
And I ain't got to get 'em
'Cause I already got 'em

Security don't check my niggas, all y'all niggas gon' respect my niggas
Either that or get a whack or get a bat to the back of the neck my nigga
Yeah that shorty with y'all with y'all, cause she never met a big dog 'til she met my niggas
Got a big dream, from a small town
Got a small circle, you never get around
Old hoes thinkin' I'mma put 'em on now
Room full of bad bitches, I'mma put 'em all down
Always been broke, who's rich now?
I ain't never had change, why switch now?
Money talks nigga, I ain't never heard shit
Til y'all heard me spit, now everything loud
Got a mojo, with a flow-flow
Got a whole load, don't know if it's a promo
Never cuff hoes, hell no that's a no-no
Coolin' in the cut with a bud sipping romo
No love for the po-po's
Gotta pour more for my niggas in the hell hole
Never tell though, I'mma need a little more dope for my uncle
Cause I sell flows and he sell dope, nigga work

Yeah, Euro
What up this Mack the fortune teller
The nigga that put y'all on Miley Cyrus
Negrodamus my nigga
Predicting futures
You need some lottery numbers holla at me nigga I got you

Put a nigga in that hearse, long ass K no nina
Word to Martin I'm cold with this homie buck shots
Like Pam make a nigga say, ""Damn Gina""
Millzy! Money don't mean nothing, my youngin'
I'll kill you for some sneakers
This Dedication 5, no vacations slime
We in the endzone and they in bleachers
Cheerleaders, we ain't worried 'bout nothin', nothin'
Nigga act dumb, push the button, fuck 'em
Get 'em out of here like the 6th foul in the NBA
Little nigga no discussion
Boy I'll close ya case, like judge Millz Lane
All y'all wack ass niggas stay out of Millz lane
Big guns that go over the shoulder dog
My team strapped, no overalls
So please don't make me do it, got soldiers and shooters
These bullets will swallow like shots of Kahlua
When we light up the weed then we fly like a rumor
Then hop on the plane and fly over you losers
Put racks on your head now you sleep in the sewer
I'm not from this era that beef on computers
Look boy if it's war, then all we comin' after you
Special I'm smashin ya, somethin' like Gallagher
Shots in your challenger, shots in your passenger
Hittin' your girl then I'm passing her
Jae Millz ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Young Money ain't worried 'bout nothin'
D5!

We ain't worried 'bout nothin' (Young Money)
Nigga we ain't worried 'bout nothin' (Jae Millz)
Nigga we ain't worried 'bout nothin' (not a thing)

This ain't a dick, this a motherfuckin' python
And if it's war call me, fuck Tyrone
You know what? It's time for y'all niggas to sit
Big ass house, no room for bullshit
Such and such told me, ""Chuck, you ain't rich!""
Well tell such and such they can suck my dick
Cause I got a lot of sperm if you need it, sperm if you need it
I made you go crazy for no fuckin' reason
I beat you pussy niggas up 'til you start bleedin'
Menstrual cycle, fuck it, go ahead bleach 'em
Diarrhea, I'm running this shit, I'm just gettin' my laps on

Got paper like a fuckin' school folder
If her grass ain't cut, get the lawnmower
Tony, tell them bitches it's Libra gang
Vocal lessons, let the nina sing
Before I leave up out this bitch, they gon' know my fuckin' name
Birdman Jr. Junior! Fuck a dog, bitch I got a puma

Lame ass boys don't want no trouble, pussy niggas just a bunch of suckers

Pull big willie out my pants and all them girls say, ""Hercules!""

I been snorklin' in the cash, going Krogers with the bags
I done went blonde, goin' Hulk Hogan on they ass
Tell my shooters ""Count me out"", and I end up doin' the math
I been fuckin' in the shower so my dreads soaked
I been fuckin' on the counter 'cause my bed's soaked
You know my lean nice and cold, like some dead folks
You know my eyes nice and low, like I make egg rolls, oh
I got them pills, we call 'em illies
I got the wet, I'm water whippin'
I rob his ass like Robin Givens

BET, that's how I'm livin'
I got three hoes followin' me
Ho, ho, ho; I'm down the chimney
Hello, I make her throw away her pussy toys, yeah
Ain't got a job, I make her look employed, yeah
She do the money count in just her drawers, yeah
I make her count out loud, I listen hard
I been fuckin' models, they been walkin' 'round in towels
They been snortin' powder, I been in here takin' downers
They been countin' for hours, getting kisses by the thousands
Money and the power, they be in here watchin' Power

They don't want the fame, kill your ass then fly to Spain
Ding-ding, coke and ice cream, that shit got a nice ring
Put my face up in the pussy, I'm just sight-seeing
Yeah, starin' at the world through an automatic
Sweet mother of pearl, sweet Jesus of Nazareth
Quickly, quickly, quickly, gettin' slow, baby
I could turn your baby to a poor baby, sure baby
Look, I cannot sit down without gettin' down
What's new in town? Let's do it now
A couple marbles ain't been found
A couple screws been screwed around
My father ain't been 'round, my heart ain't missed a pound
The system of a down, and it's been up and down
A psycho, all I'm missin' is the gown
Sippin' up, I piss enough to drown, twistin' up a pound
High as fuck, a Bentley truck on clouds, y'all so underground
I break a whole bunch of fuckin' vows
Come to hunt you down
All up in your section
Use protection when you fuck around
Possession of deception, imperfection, no affection
No correct your transgression, turn depression to aggression
Got an obsession for expression
With no pressure, no discretion, and the F is for the
""Flesh of all the fleshless ones, I left 'em, F 'em.""

Your bitch open so we run in it, any club, got my gun in it
I ain't even got to touch you dudes, I'll get you killed young nigga
Eat, sleep, talk shit, rap, brand new AK, all black
Tunechi gave me this gift wrapped
Your bars sweet, candy, Kit-Kat
Hope you pussy niggas get mad
Keep the voodoo on me, witchcraft
Off-White, Gucci, mix match
All my diamonds drip, shit splash
Black BMW, your bitch gave me top at the W
She told me Dollaz I'm over you
These bitches way too emotional, uh
So much perkys, I'm barely sober
Diamond choker, crazy, bipolar
Keep my niggas with me, I tote 'em
Never be committed, I told her
Enough with you niggas, I do not fuck with you niggas
I know I'm stuck with you niggas
Grew up with you niggas
We all was swipin' cards, scammin' it up with you niggas
Miami ballin', it's a hobby, call a nigga Joe Robbie
Haitian food or hibachi, ATV's, walkie-talkies
Chris Paul, we load the rocket
Eight ball, corner pocket
Ah man, nigga stop it, you know it's Dollaz
When it comes to rap, no problems
Haha, hold up, talk to 'em
I'm the hottest out in my city, Bad Boy too, ask Diddy
Hundred foot yacht, jet skiin', bitches kissin' bitches, lesbian
Niggas talkin' beef, let's see 'em
Y'all don't want beef, y'all vegan
If so, come, no semen

Future put me on, he from Atlanta
Niggas in my city crabs in a barrel

Give her dope dick, now she under the sedation

Catch us at the game sitting on the baseline
We can call a timeout, take a lil time out
Pockets too deep, shorty, you gonna have to climb out
Faviana prom dress with your spine out
And I live on the beach, you can get that panty line out
She wants to own me and I ain't trying to fight it
She said it's her dick, she got it copyrighted
And I don't pay for pussy because her pussy's priceless
I go fishing in it, and I ain’t a Pisces
Gucci only to the grocery store
Stop playing, bitch, we balling like Okafor
And now we headed to the dealer
I'm going to cop my baby something with no ceilings, ahh!

Shoot, or get shot, or a nigga choose for you

I pace and turn and she'll face the thermos
First birthday wish was getting caked up
Shoot a nigga, wake up on the wake-up
Lay down in a model bitch A-cup
Then I put pearls in a bitch like Jacob
Play tough, tape off of this tape-up
Race off like some motherfuckin' makeup
Take off, looking for something to take up
Get the paper or you goin' in the paper?
Not horoscopes, but in the horror scope
Pray to God you see tomorrow, nope
They gave my nigga thirty for a jar of dope
But do a nigga dirty with a bar of soap
Blowing so much, you sneezing dick
Believe in me, I don't believe in shit
Y'all pinching pennies? I'm squeezing drip
It's Young Money 'til I'm in the freezer stiff, bitch

First degree murder
Beg them nuh push it further
This a nuh beef, we make burger
The youths, dem strapped with dem burner
First degree murder
Beg dem nuh push it further
This a nuh beef, we make burger
'Cause the youths, dem strapped with dem burner

It's all about the money, nigga, fuck the fame
Where we come from, shots ring, nigga, broad day
Lil' woadie said he had a chance, he'd do this shit again
Poppin' pills for the pain, but still won't feel a thing
It's deeper than this rap, I'm in the back soaking game
Cartier frames got 'em looking at me strange
Why pre mostly heard and I'm rarely sane
Low-key can still get a brick off my name
Now I'ma tell you this here for my youngin 'nem
The same ones I hung the corners with, do numbers with
If it ever was a problem, watch 'em pull up quick
Caught an L sticking to the script, you know I switched
We now switch

First degree murder
Beg dem nuh push it further
This a nuh beef, we make burger
The youths, dem strapped with dem burner
First degree murder
Beg dem nuh push it further
This a nuh beef, we make burger
'Cause the youths, dem strapped with dem burner

And everybody know I'm sharp when I ride
Hop out that new Ferrari with that little horse on the side, yeah
Zoom-zoom, bitch, ride a nigga broom, witch
Half a ki, wet, stinking up your whole room, bitch
Now, break out the perfume, bitch
And niggas come from off that beach

I ain't never scared, I'm protected everywhere
And if a nigga disrespect me, then he shall be buried there
That's my word, got a urge to hit a nigga and swerve
And them birds in the tree get shot down to my feet
It's me, motherfucker, what's better to see?
And when you greedy like me, ain't nothing better than beef
See, I would meet each one of you niggas in the street
Then eat, and pick you little bitches out my teeth

Stuntin’,Dedication 3,2008.0,"(Dramatic, nigga!)
Well, alright, here I go

I'm a rapper turned singer, and you can tell that he smoke
But I don't need my vocal chords, 
all I hit is c-notes
N.E.R.D. flow, I spaz if I'm pre-voked
I'm about to change the fuckin' game, pass the remote
Money is everything, and it's every other thing
I'm part of the choir, that's the motto that my brother sing
Cash is the right now, women are post game
MoneyOverBitches dot com, check the domain
It's comin' too soon, album on the way
People ask me if I pray, I say, ""Yeah, once in a blue moon""
Oops, I mean a red moon, I did it again, Tune
Let me leave a space in for your Blood affiliation, I state
Heavy metaphors, flow so overweight
I could rap around these other young'ns like a cobra snake
Frostbite Drizzy, nigga, nobody as cold as Drake
Keep your ass in-line, don't be tryna to roller skate
Fuck all the discrete shit, I get on some deep shit
I am 21, tell me, who do I compete with?
I'm on my elite shit, you could tell I'm real
Cause I'm gettin' hood love and I ain't even talkin' street shit
Young Angel, Young Lion, I'm done tryin'
I'm just doin'
, who's drinkin'? cause I'm buyin'
It's on me, everything is on me
And my girl is still down like she's fuckin' Jon B
And when I go dumb, I tend to do dumb shit
I just listened back and now I'm sounding like a trumpet
This for all the strippers 'cause I know that they gone bump it
Tell 'em ""Back it up and dump it, back it, back it up and dump it""
Ain't no pistols here, your money will disappear
My accountant will feed his family off my fiscal year
Tax brackets and back-and-forth faxes
My money coming full circle, get up on my axis
Maybe I'ma kill 'em, only 'cause I promised
They think I'm bein' cocky, but I'm only bein' honest
I'm swallowin' the Goose, got a model gettin' loose
And I never party 'less I got some bottles in the booth
I just walk up on the scene, I'm about to take this
I'm just havin' patience, cause I want it to make sense
White cup, orange pop, Tennessee State shit
Drop a four in it and appreciate the greatness, Drizzy

(Gangsta!) I just want y'all to remember
That this is the first mixtape you bumped
While you had a black president

Yeah, p-p-pass the dro
I am such a beast and you can ask them hoes
And they might even say you should leave me alone
And homie's scared, cause his bitch like me
Stuntin' is a habit, get it from my daddy
Just like Shaggy, I tote that boom-bastic
I'm a rude bastard, I don't give a fuck 'bout y'all
I ain't talkin' marbles, you can pluck my balls
And yes I'm fallin', but up I fall
And if your bitch in heat, she could fuck my dog
I went from penny pinchin' to private planes
Never sat on any benches, I got in games
Starter, Carter, ball harder
Ten girls, penthouse suite, ya'll order
Whatever y'all please: wine, crackers, and cheese
They take off their clothes and put on my tees
The supplement I've taken got me feelin' mighty
My gun and money don't split, call that shit Siamese
Yes, my watch make the frickin' time freeze
Your girl bless me, she suck my dick and I sneeze
Cheap-ass apartment, just the kitchen I need
And 18 Gs is why the chicken crossed the street
Whatcha know 'bout it? My niggas so bout it
If you kill everybody, they can't go to court about it
Weezy, I ignore the liars, baby, I ignite the fire
I am like a Michael Myers, leave your body in the dryer
Got the shotty on the side of me, my bad boys follow me
I'm a bad boy, obviously, pop one at your Ivy League
I don't have a rivalry, if so, you'll have a cah-sualty
Oops, I meant a casualty, oops, I meant catastrophe
Oops, I meant, actually, you niggas is just ass to me
And big wet pussy is more like what I'm rathering
Welcome to the gathering, welcome to the burying
Or I hang you on the wall like a art gallery
You got short salary, and I got long money
I got Cash Money, I got Young Money, bitch (Gangsta!)

See I told y'all it'll be well worth the wait, right?

Boy that chopper keep drumming like brrrat-at-at-tat
Or pa-rum-pa-pum-pum, and I'm so young
But I'm a giant, like ""Fe-Fi-Fo-Fum""
Just bought a new crib inside Sodom
Got some money put away in case the hurricane come
I'm a fucking shame, huh? Yeah I know, yeah I know
I go out the country to get all my clothes and my hoes
I go out my way just to get my dro and my dough
'Cause I love it more than I love my hoes, yes I does
I got gasoline coming out my pores, I'm a torch
I got glasses like that white boy Scott Storch, and a Porsche
I got license for the scorch, snipers at your porch

You ain't satisfied 'til your son'll be calling
Telling you where to leave the money in the morning
OK, you want a zombie movie instead
That's when you walk in your house and everybody dead
Yeah, I could take a shit where I stand, where I stand
And watch you pussies piss in your pants
You ain't a man, you're a ho, I could kill him with the flow
And then play the guitar at the fucking funeral
Big guns so they drinking big shots
And my gang go Saddam Hussein and missile launch
The Korean call me Wayne Chang, now listen ma
I don't know karate, but after the brain, I'll kick you out
You niggas suck like Tony Romo, no homo
And I'm all about my money, I get paid for promo
Yeah, I'm the man in this bitch
They say money talks, well I'm the ventriloquist
And if I ever jump, I'll probably land in your bitch

Boy I'm more cooler than a fan and a mint
And when I'm done this track will need a couple bandages
I be with savages and I'm above average

And you know I'm gonna score like Deion after picks
I'm rollin' on a pill, she get that morning after dick

It come back, run around the gang, yeah that's some dizzy money
The Humpty Dumpty, she get on that dick, she's very comfy
I put a Rolie on her wrist, she used to wear a scrunchy
Party times, Tunechi wise
Wifey's size, truly lies
Booty, thighs, bougie pride
Gucci slides, moody, tired
Woozy, high, movie night
Jacuzzi time, ooo-ee, ahh
Dinner, prime; sushi, wine
And for dessert I have the cutie-pie
Lied about the price to the spender
And I lied about my height on Tinder
And if I hit it one time I won't remember
But can't forget it if she bring another member
Double date, double date
In a Wraith, in a Wraith
Bitch, I'm eatin' full plate like November
In a Wraith, in a Wraith
In a different mind state
Let her sniff some snowflakes and call her Winter (yah)
Fuck with him and get the money
Then come fuck with me and split the money
I'll fuck her when she with her buddy
She guzzle dick and kiss her buddy
She said I love you when he send some money
I said I love you give your pimp some money
And she don't ask how much she just come dump it
And I don't ask how high I just start jumpin'
You ain't know I kiss below the button, what
Girl close your eyes and let me show you somethin', what
And if you ride me like the road is bumpin', what
I leave my key in and the motor runnin', what
Oh my god I hope they kissin' cousins
If they not it's gon' be consequences, repercussions
Woah, I just count a hundred thousand hundreds
And I told my babe ride the wave, Cowabunga
Lied about her night to her nigga
Her vagina 'bout to cry me a river
If she ask me for advice and I igged her
But she know it wasn't me, it was the sizzurp
Gotta wait, gotta wait
'Til I wake, 'til I wake
I wake up and tell bae how much I missed her
She looks straight in my face then start pointin' to the space
Where she want it on her face, she's particular

Y-O-U-N-G with money, yeah
We Y-O-U-N-G with money
Y-O-U-N-G with money

And the inspiration is you pussy-ass niggas
I just realized y'all can't fuck with me
And you never will, bitch-ass niggas
Weezy F. Baby, believe that
Haha, yeah

I got them 24 inches, sitting on them Joe Buddens
And the trunk straight jumping, bitch, I can't hear nothing
Or I might do the Spurs, sitting on them Tim Duncans
And in that Lamborghini I do donuts like Dunkin's
How come every bad bitch with a pussy wanna fuck him?
But I just feed 'em drugs and just watch 'em fuck each other
My neck was a hundred and my wrist was another
It make her pussy wet, I leave that bitch with a puddle
I'm a beast, I'm a dog, I should rap with a muzzle
Peyton Manning flow, I just go, no huddle
Baby girl getting straight dick, no cuddle
You know I'm out this world, I just bought a space shuttle
I'mma put some D's on that bitch
And these hoes starting to get like fleas on my shit
Have you seen her? Who? Nina, she's on my hip
Yellow-white diamonds, call it cheese on them grits
You niggas ain't ballin'
Real talk, you niggas can't guard me
Two niggas can't guard me, you looking at Jordan
From the side, like Spike at the Garden
I got the hardest bars, call me the warden

I break a bitch down like Tonya Harding
Bitch, I'm col', not dude off Martin
Pockets just fat like the Klumps and Norbit
Bitch, I'm fly like a magic carpet
And bitch, I'm fresh like a pack of Orbit
See, I'mma take it and go bring it back to New Orleans
And bitch, I'mma shine in the land of darkness
In which I'mma grind 'til my stacks is tall as a wall is
And I'm high, don't wanna know how deep the fall is
No, I can't come down
And every time I send my girl out of town
I put some keys on that bitch, I'm a certified gangsta
Haters make me nauseous, the money make me anxious
Listen how my words are poetic like Langston
Dreads down my back like I come straight from Kingston
But I come from Hollygrove, seventeen, danger zone
So many C-notes, I can sing a song
T-top coupe, looking like a thong
Your girl love my dick, she treats it like a bong
I don't wanna be right if gettin' high is wrong
My eyes so low, I look like I'm from Hong Kong
Boy, I got more green than the Bishop Don Juan
OK, I'm not a rookie, I'm a pro — methazine fiend
Make the homies say ho, and make all the girlies scream
I am a vegetarian, man, I only eat beats
Wear a lot of carats, and I smoke the best greens
No beef in my grocery bag
Just some Swishers and a whole bunch of cans of whoop-ass, ha
I'm strapped, like a bookbag
So anyone of y'all can come on and get a foot tag
D.O.A
Ride all night; sleep, no way
Sleep when I lay
Six feet deep, and until that day
I'mma be living like it is that day
Yeah, I keep holding on
I said, bitch I been hot, bitch the stove been on
If you don't like it, I roll over and roll alone
Fuck you and the horse that you rode in on
Yeah, some cool shorts and my Kobes on
Looking slicker than the lane that you bowling on
If they ain't tell you I'm the shit, then they told you wrong

In a styrofoam

Very few are chosen
Looking at the wall
You can feel them close in
Baby what the fuck is wrong with them
What the fuck is wrong with them

Mind over matter, money over all
The world is on my shoulders
Should I dust my shoulders off?
Uzi rat-a-tatter, knocking over walls
Fuck the bullshit but just don’t fuck it raw
Man pussy has a pattern and I know where I’m going
And if you got beef I turn it to a tenderloin
Sanity kills so I live the crazy life
I wonder if they'll pay attention if I change the price
Life is my wife, till death do us part
Man I’m fly as fuck, you ain't even next to depart
Quick draw McGraw, I hope you like art


Stepping on the bullshit, you can be my doormat
Y’all ain't going nowhere with that hating shit, four flat
Disrespectful on the beat, Borat
Fuck the system and the pussy wasn’t all that

Hip-hop was washed up so I brought some change to finish my load
I load millions and more millions
Money to the ceilings? Nigga, NO CEILINGS!

The world is waking up, you can hear the pigeons yawning
I'mma get that worm now, tell 'em it's my turn now
Y'all niggas need a lesson on some ethic; you gon' learn now
I do this for the love of it; saliva, cause I love to spit
And I juke it; for my future records, y'all gon' love to spin
Fucking with my brethren, 10 years strong

Oooh oooh, oooh

Oooh

You're in

Uh, more beautiful than the world
Word, matter of fact beautiful ain't the word
Unexplainable is the beauty of her
And I will be the race car hitting her curves
Errrrr
I drive her crazy, stupid retarded
Yeah and then I park it
She got a smile on her that put a smile on me
She cater to me she get all destiny child on me
She ride for me even though I got miles on me
She gon ride till the day they put flowers on me
Thats my darling
And I love it, yeh
Thats my, yeh
So sweet she bad for me
But she so good I'll take the cavity
Falling for her like how safe is gravity
I'll make your girl about face and marry me
Hahahaha, yeh
I do, do you

But ahhh, the things I'm willing to do to her
I wish I could have a threesome with two of her
I would sing a love song if I knew the words
But I'll be damned if another nigga do it first
Cos you the one, damn I think I see the sun
I guess that mean you gotta run
Well holla at me when you done

Can I dig it
When you baby
Woop woop woop
My darling baby

Uhh
She nothing like every other dime
I think about her and couple things come to mind
Thoughts like if she end up my baby mother fine
Cos we only use a rubber like every other time
Oooh, I bet she so embarrassed
I had to take her ass to Paris
Give her the moments that she cherish
You know

Yep
She got it coming to her like an heiress
And anything she want I Will like Farris
Oops I meant ferris and in the coupe I tint very light
So them hating bitches can see me and you at every light
Oooh, and I hope its one of them long lights
I mean I hope its one of them long nights
No wrong turns, ain't no such things as a wrong right

Uh yeah
You make me feel so good
And every time we cut I swear it heals so good
Its been over a year that shit is still so good
No adjusting for you, you know just what to do and all
Yea, oh and I love it
See I'm trying to make it public
I think the glass slipper does fit

And yesterday I told her she a muthafucker
And how her new haircut is so becoming of her
Oh thats your girl, well I'mma make a women of her
Never do to another what we do one another
Now thats a numbers for ya, and i'll give up my summers for ya
Yeah I'll spend my winters and my springs on it
And put a ring on it, eyy


Uhh, just say yes not no
The club is overrated baby lets not go
Lets stay home and burn a couple calories
Fuck the house up and make the maid earn a salary
Yeah I cook you dinner if you cook me breakfast
They say that nobodies perfect but you look perfected
I really love to be the one you took a step with
So trust me when I tell you it'd be worth the effort

Shes unbelievable like a purple leopard
Just give me the formula watch me work the method
Hehe, Weezy F, I prefer the best shit
And babe you the fucking best
You deserve a trophy
You could be my four leaf clover
Her clothes aren't tight nigga their cosy
And when she turn around they say Whoa like Joey
Thats my baby

Let ’Em All In,Dedication 6,2017.0,"I realize you niggas is like the objects in the rearview mirror—
You really appear 
much
 closer than you are
Got a long way to go, young boy
[Verse 1: Euro + 
DJ Drama
]
Uh
Uh
Check
(Catch up, niggas!)
Let 'em all in, bet 'em all in
Put me in the jungle, I get us all minks
Don't play with my wave
Know what? Let 'em all sink
I don't need therapy, I got so big
Even when they talk crazy I still don't shrink
I'ma black out, Michael Blackson's skin tone
Homie gotta sit for a while back home
Hotline bling if you get his phone
Gotta own up or you get disowned
Eyes dried up, I don't really cry much
And the gold chain match everything I touch
Whip gotta match every bitch I fuck, foreign
Y'all niggas talkin' 'bout what? Borin'
Bane from it, I came from it
I'm raised by it, I'm stained from it
Shot for the stars from the darkness
I aim from it, now change comin'
Who'd have thought a nigga shake somethin'?
All these records, I'ma break somethin'
Playin' my shit around the graveyard
Y'all fuck around and wake somethin'
Mean mug like I hate somethin'
Hit the stu' and I ate somethin'
Great rapper or a great hustler—
Promise you I die a great somethin'

And I am beginnin' and endin'
A nigga run in kickin' and flippin'
A nigga worth spendin'
A nigga with the semi admittin'
Glock is definitive on 'em, iron Emmys
Got an eye on 'em
Still on these niggas more than any one of you
We knuck if we buck, if you my brother we up
If not, I don't give a motherly fuck
Only in us we trust, you fuss we hush
They rush we bust, adjust, and dust and flushed 'em
If you don't know what my salary is
You 'bout to know what a fatality is
What the reality is
If I don't know what my calories is
Then nine times out of ten
You won't never know where your cavity is
Hit a forty, know it had to be his
A dude foul with a smile
They would never know how mad that he is
They don't ever know what pattern he is
He gotta be from Earth 2, or somewhere from out on Saturn he is
Now I'm goin' where no gravity is, some other galaxy shit
But we'd rather talk about the MAC and the bricks
We takin' on all names, it ain't no more games
I'm a stand up nigga, Cory Kaepernick bitch
I don't know what to call you
Niggas claimin' they loyal to the soil
But boy I'm loyal to the oil that boil
To court with the all you
You cannot avoid it when I'm gonna destroy you
Work from the ceiling to make sure that I fall you
I'm dedicated to this rhyme shit
S double, the militia gang, they don't ever try them bitch
I got a nine and click, a high been brick
A bottom bitch, I buy them thick
Drivin' stick, life's a bitch, and I give dick
I ride the five, my partner crip
Shout out the East, we parkin' shit
I just revive, I don't remix
I don't remind, until 
C5
 we got 
D6

The best things in life are free, not cheap, free 
C5
Message, no reply
Rest In Peace, no peace sign
I keep an eye on these guys
My third eye give her sweet eyes
The bird eye's view keep spy
But I can get your wings deep fried
Try, try again, keep tryin'
All the traffic hours, you a taxi driver, we some maximizers
Ever heard of San Francisco 49'ers, we some masterminders
Made it to the top just to get sniped from the floor at the very bottom
Ain't that a bitch, man tell me about it
But I ain't trippin', unless the trip is private
I sip in silence
I tried to make it beautiful, and this shit came out perfect
Let the guns speak for they self, I ain't never been a loud person
Walkin' 'round the house in the turban
These niggas washed up with no detergent
Take your heart and I am not a surgeon
Pullin' triggers like shower curtains
Ain't got no soul because my baby sucked it out of me
Me and my whoas in Las Vegas playing the thot machines
Stick to my goals, expectations like a soccer team
Waiting to exhale only to let out some steam
Girl let's make a movie, what's a movie without a shower scene?
Treat my semi like an Emmy, need some nominees
Taught me how to count before they taught me how to read
I knew all my OG's before my ABC's

But uh, I guess I'll go ahead and show these niggas
What to do with one of the beats, mane... listen

I like my seat down low and my window slightly cracked
Ridin' with a bad ho, with her girlfriend in the back
I like to get real high and I never look back
And you don't wanna try me, and don't I look strapped?
I come from the hardest city, ain't nobody fuckin' with it
Got a black-and-gold soul, with a fresh New Orleans fitted
And a collared polo and a pair of Bally Bucks
Young Money, motherfucker, know you worried 'bout us
Cash Money, motherfucker, CMR I trust
Never had my jaw broken, but his jaw I bust
And I probably got your girlfriend on my bus
What happens on my bus, stays on my bus
And that 
white widow weed
 out the jar is a must
If you give me a cigar, then a cigar I'll bust
Put that white widow weed in the cigar and puff
Look ma, I'm tryna make a porno, starring us
Well not just us, a couple foreign sluts
Yeah, we make this some ménage à troisin', y'all in?
I be with Jim Jones and we be ballin', ballin'
Yeah, baby, we ballin', like Rawlins and Spalding
Pint of DJ Screw and that Hawaiian
I am leanin' like a 3 legged lion, climbing
Right to the top of the motherfuckin' mountain.. counting
I'm gonna need me an accountant to count it
Mannie got this fuckin' beat poundin', it's poundin'
But it was just lost, until I found it, I found it
Stole it like a scoundrel, Hollygrove hound it
Put this bitch to sleep, fuckin' right, I night-gowned it
Niggas talkin cheap, tell them niggas, ""Pipe down, bitch!""
Bloods in the building, now everybody soundless
Beatin' up this track like a muthafuckin' round-fist
Blind, deaf, or crazy, I'mma spit like a long kiss
I am just a Martian, ain't nobody else on this planet
I know, see I live by my only
Say, where my cheese, nigga? Where my macaroni?
Baby, I get up in dat ass, and act a donkey
Candy on candy, nigga grippin' the grain
See, I'm the only fire that can live in the rain
I am so so New Orleans, like 1825 Tulane

Hahaha.... see, you gotta be from New Orleans
To know what the fuck I'm talkin bout
And if you don't... fuck you

Pray to the Lord,The Drought is Over 3: Who is the Predator,UnKnown,"Before I sleep
I pray to the Lord my soul to keep
And if I should die before I wake
I pray to the Lord my soul to take for goodness sake
Before I sleep
I pray to the Lord my soul to keep
And if I should die before I wake
I pray to the Lord my soul to take for goodness sake

Yeah, I wrote my will just the other week
It was funny, it was only one sheet
And I know there's only one me
But I hope I am everything my son be
I'm trying to live right, stay on the drum beat
But I'm in the fast lane, in the front seat
I wonder will I lose control of the Maserati?
And hit some tree, just being young me
Is there a heaven for G's and soldiers?
I can't go to hell, cause I'd take over
I feel it approaching but I ain't scared
I made that bed and I should rest in peace

Before I sleep
I pray to the Lord my soul to keep
And if I should die before I wake
I pray to the Lord my soul to take for goodness sake
Before I sleep
I pray to the Lord my soul to keep
And if I should die before I wake
I pray to the Lord my soul to take for goodness sake

Yeah, and every time I see the sunshine
I drop down and give thanks at least one time
I'm feeling like I'm living on the front line
I'm feeling like every second is crunch time
I've had breakfast, will I make it to lunch time?
And I ain't joking so don't be looking for punchlines
Will I be the next victim of a gun crime?
I don't know the answer, that's why I brung mine
Riding by myself late at night
Pistol on my lap at every single red light
I made my bed right, so when I do I should sleep tight
In peace I rest

Before I sleep
I pray to the Lord my soul to keep
And if I should die before I wake
I pray to the Lord my soul to take for goodness sake
Before I sleep
I pray to the Lord my soul to keep
And if I should die before I wake
I pray to the Lord my soul to take for goodness sake

Bury me a gangsta cause that's what I live
Don't cry for me I gave the best I could give
I can only do me, so that's what I did
And I cherish every breath of my kid
And I don't wanna go before she grow, that ain't cool
But in this game of life, I don't make the rules
Shit, so that's why I get twisted
So I can't feel it when it hits me
And my moms don't need that on her
But I see death around the corner
And if he, so happens to make his way around the block
You gotta answer the door when he knock, believe that

Before I sleep
I pray to the Lord my soul to keep
And if I should die before I wake
I pray to the Lord my soul to take for goodness sake
Before I sleep
I pray to the Lord my soul to keep

Probably watchin' 
Baller Blockin'

Where ya ass was at? You was in the drought, boy
I was probably at the fight bringin' out Floyd

Said she love me 'cause I'm laid back, she outgoin'
Opposites attract, pockets fat, like Samoan
I just told my goons I got it, I just waved 'em off
I just told Tunechi, ""I got it"" and he said, ""Of course""
Lose my mind, the only time I'd ever take a loss
I work too hard for taking off,
 
rrt, I'm taking off
Really 'bout to see a billion, I'm in arm's reach
Sleep on a hammock in the middle of two palm trees

Found the treasure chest, inside was a heartbeat
And Katrina had us hustlin' out a RV
We had to stash and still balled, Steve Harvey

And we set a nigga up like eHarmony
And your bitch plain, nigga, and your car cheap
And we leave your brain right there on your broad cheek
And we leave some stains right there on your offspring
And the purple rain right here in the soft drink
Yeah, the purple rain right here in the soft drink
And to fight the pain, nigga, like a horse tranq
And we don't complain, nigga, and we don't blink

And he dumb as hell, and I swear his ass don't think
I think he run with 12 and I think his whole squad linked

Call her from the jail phone

Talkin' 'bout you thinkin' 'bout some ass shots
Taking all these snapshots, different backdrops
Dancing, posting pics after you cash out
Ever since you got them titties you

Saying you feel like one of my side bitches

Every time that hotline bling
You just need some time to think, yeah
Don't care what your friends think
Them bitches want that diamond ring
But ever since you met them bitches
You knew you, you're a new you
Forgot to tell you I fucked them bitches 'fore I knew you
I guess they forgot too

You shouldn't call me from your girl's phone
Cause she ain't gonna delete my number
Press me when she know that you're gone
That bitch is gonna hit me right up
And do I still have my own private ring?
Oh, now you keep your shit on silent ring
Damn, why you think I let you keep your diamond ring?
To remind you of when I was king

I used to call you from the jail phone
And you would press one and receive my love
Used to call her from a jail phone
Phone sex 'til it beeps, time’s up
Girl, talkin' 'bout you thinkin' 'bout some ass shots
Taking beaucoup snapshots, different backdrops
I still fuck that pussy 'til you blackout
Take your tap out, no ceilings",https://genius.com/Lil-wayne-hotline-bling-lyrics
Love Me or Hate Me,Tha Carter III,2007.0,"Thank you

The fails, the falls

I am agri-culture
Swagger so mean it might insult ya
Hah, I'm like an ultra-vulture
I fuck around and catapault ya
Torture
Thought ya parents taught ya?
You guys is chocha
I'm gone, buenos noches
Flow scorcher
And I don't even write
No author
So harder
So smarter
All about a dollar
Like four quarters
Oh Father
Will tonight be my last?
And if so
Make sure my kids see my cash
And I know
I'm solid like an elbow cast
And my future will be better than my past
Weezy!

You can love me or hate me
I swear it won't make me or break me
I'm going wherever the money take me
Until they funeral and wake me
And don't wake me
'Cause I'm sleeping
I'm dreaming
I know that there's a better way
'Cause I've seen it, Lord
But this faster money is so convenient
And I need it
Say I need it

C-A-R, T-E-R
I spit movies like a VCR
I spit rounds like the Tiki bar
And if I got beef I'm the meat cleav-er
And I are
The illest nigga Martin Luther King died for
And I ride for
Hollygrove, One-Seven, Eagle Street
And I'm higher than an eagle's feet
But I believe in me
Apple is the cross street
I am just an offspring
Born in the ghetto
That's why I can't let go
One call I'll have my dogs on ya like an echo
Baby, I am the real deal, no pickle
Uh, spit sickle-cell psycho
I go
Off, like a motherfucking rifle
And I'm from
The underground baby, like a pipe hole
And I will stand tall like light poles
Until the light blows

And you can love me or hate me
Baby, I swear it won't make me or break me
And I be going wherever the money take me
Until they funeral and wake me
And don't wake me
'Cause I'm sleeping
And I'm dreaming
See I'm just hustling
Living what I believe in, dog
And it's a problem when our homies not eating
And I'm greedy
I'm greedy

Share my blood
Feed my family
My flow will have to plead insanity
So sick I need Gray's Anatomy
Acid, like a bust open battery
I'm cool like L.A. nights
I'm tight like ballet tights
Ay, Juelz
I swear the other day I pissed Cristal
These bitches tryna kick it like Juntao
I gotta watch my head in the battle
I'm just trying to stay ahead of my shadow
And I'm floating like a boat and a paddle
Alligators and rattlesnakes
But I promise I will take a nigga off, like a Saturday
Got money to validate
I'm icy like carrot cake
Different colored diamonds make me look like a salad plate
I'm straight out the alleyway
It's the nigga ya daddy hate
Weezy F. Baby—great!

I know they love me then hate me
But I'm a G –
It won't make me or break me
And you can find me wherever the money place me
Yeah, until you're riding to the late me
And don't wake me
'Cause I'm sleeping
And I'm dreaming
And me and my Lord got an agreement, y'all
And so I thank him every day for my achievements

Come check with Dram, and do ya job

I'm not worthy of your controversy
I'm not thirsty, baby, I'm allergic
Colder than a hockey jersey, dirty like Kentucky Derby
I was lying on a gurney, I don't wanna die early
I was screaming ""Fuck the world,"" you was singin' ""Like a Virgin""
Never be concerned or worried, 2 girls, like Laverne and Shirley
Wake up in the morning early, tell 'em that I love 'em dearly
They say ""Oh my God, have mercy,"" shinin' like I got on Jergens
You can hear my diamonds screaming like they just met God in person
Oh my God the squad alerted, I confirm it
They hop up like Kermit, come to bless you like a sermon
My house lit like Pee-Wee Herman's and you know I bought it furnished
I'm determined like attorneys, y'all lil boys ain't got attorneys
I just hope she not a burden, I just hope she got a purpose
That first week was power surgin', oh my God, the socket workin
I been listening to the money, it been telling me it's coming
Sound like music to my ears, like a symphony of hundreds
Mama told me I'd be special, Grandma told me I'd be something
I made sure they wasn't guessin', made the most out they assumptions
Being everything but simple, stretch a dollar like a limo
Got a grill in one dimple, got my deal without a demo, Tunechi

Ride with Mula, yeah that's the mob
Come check with Dram, and do ya job
Thanksgiving is the name, IceBox did the chain
Rolex for the watch, motherfucker, Plain Jane

I got issues, I got problems, we got missiles in the chopper
Got a hoe from the Bahamas, let me swordfight with her tonsils
Brought the hoe up in the condo, had a party with Fernando
I got condoms in the dresser, Percocets all on the mantle
All they handle, name a bitch that I ain't fuck and I'ma bag her
Keep it real, if I ain't fuck then my bros Tune and Mack done had her
Got a bitch cook like a chef, I had a hoe from out the Memph
She like to suck dick wit no hands, she say she do shit with no help
Control myself, I been working overtime, I owe myself
I like my bitches thick and quick to go and lick below the belt
I brought a Ghost to Hollygrove, flew your ho out to my shows
What happen on these tour buses? Like Vegas, nobody knows
Got a plug on line one, had to put momma on hold
Talking numbers tryna see how I’m gonna get Mama that Ghost
Talking big money for sure, I don’t trick money to hoes
I’mma keep running 'til I’m getting three hundred a show
Yeah bitch, ride with the Mob, slob on my knob
Get some bitches back to work and do the dishes, that’s yo' job
I’ve been sipping, if they say I ain’t that nigga then they lying
I put coca on the table, made her read between the lines
I sit back waiting my time, now I’m flexin’, now I’m winnin’
I’m at Saks or I’m at Lenox, credit card ain’t got no limit
Got a Mac with a extension, want see murder? Be a witness
Y’all lil boys just mind yo business 'fore y’all swimmin with the fishes
Wait, yeah, I got the wave, I got the juice, I got the sauce, yeah ho
Smoking the green, really it’s verbal, so I’ll be calling it hard
Woah, South Beach with a bad bitch, I was just in the trenches
I was just in a Honda, now I’m skrrting in a Bentley, Jones

Why don’t I use social media? Hold on. That’s why! I’m way too high for that shit, man. I will be pressin' all kinds of wrong shit. I can’t follow ten- two fuckin' directions . Everytime I try to fuckin' order something, uh, you know what I mean, if it got two extra fuckin' screens that you gotta go through, I’m straight. You know what I mean, it’s just too much. Probably gotta be the same button to pressed to accept the shit, or deny the shit. I wouldn’t know
That’s why I don’t fuck with social media. There ain’t no other reason you know what I mean? People probably think I got like a real strong reason. Like, you know what I mean, no, ‘cause, nah man, I just don’t know how, and I be way too twisted. Like, way too twisted to be fucking with that
I don’t really text, none of that, like it’s just tough
It’s just, like, I’m not tech-savvy at all, I’m just sorry

Destroyed,No Ceilings 2,2015.0,"I think I’m seeing things
When I don’t see a thing
I woke up and realized
All the nightmares that dreaming brings
Let my people go
I know y’all hear 'em screaming things
Now load up choppers
Point it at the coppers
Let-let freedom ring
I like the sweeter things
So what bitch, no needle strings
I wake up, stretch my feet and wings
My life has no deleted scenes
I pop-pop-pop and leave the scene
Leave the scene Noxzema clean
Sippin on that lean cuisine
Incredible Hulk on creatine
My nigga
Fuck the world
And may I mention, fuck the world again
But I wanna go around the world
Tune, you down to go around the world again?
I am
And you can trust in a nigga like fam
I’m hitting these licks with my niggas like stamps
Giving these hoes headaches like rams
Yes ma’am
And I
I just might call your girl a friend
But fuck her like she my girlfriend
Talk to her like she my girl
Like, oops you look like my girl’s twin
I sin, I'm bad, I meant ""My bad""
I’m lost in future, present, past
All those drinks I had
I speed, I'm fast, I blink, I crash
They say it’s my time
I’m racing time, I think I’m last
And if Tune mentions lean again
Then I might drink his stash
The underdogs understand what I lay over tracks
New school, but all I listen to is older raps
Bitch I still
I still been drinking on the low
I never think because I know
And pimpin haven't died and money getting old
And now the wrinkles starting to show
My rims twinkle like a toe
I’m tippy toeing wit' your ho
One thing led to another, and then the pencil broke
I got that; handgun on the table, shotgun in the closet
Police in disguises, I don’t like surprises
I don’t like tomatoes, I don’t like tamales
Shoutout to my plugs, I pray the rats don’t chew the wires
Straight ballin, you niggas just bald spots
When they tried to read my palms the pages were torn out
And you pussy niggas get hauled off
No cough drops
I’m tryna make the same cash off rap they made off pop
I’m off topic
I killed more than I did with a gun with a skill
I’m no role model
I’m rollin' with models, rollin' off pills
I’m rollin' over
Whoever's not rollin' with us, then road kill
Tryna get Uncle Phil cake
In case I die tryin' I wrote Wills
I’m chillin', for the moment
'Til I can’t figure out the code
To get the motherfucking safe open
Who the fuck left the cage open
Stage of rage
I’m liable to blow your fucking face open
Every bone you could break, broken
If I go broke, every home I could break in, broke in
Pussy look like a steak smokin'
Niggas slippin' like the lake frozen
And I hate rodents
And I stay chokin'
Off the straight potent
'Til it make no sense
Niggas talking shit
Nigga I can get you wacked
Nigga you can picture that
'Til you break your lens
Nigga take your ends
Nigga fuck your ho
While you cutting your grass
Nigga cut your throat
Taking out your trash
Pull up on you slow
Going nowhere fast
When you got nowhere to go
Nigga hung 'em by a rope
Dump 'em by the boats
Fuck 'em, adios
Fuck 'em, I don't care
Got a bad bitch naked
And she just asked
“What you gonna do to me that I ain't done to myself?”
I say “Ooh talk dirty, but don’t talk long""
You leave Wayne’s world it’s a long walk home
My pockets on that growth hormone
I call them shots, can I get a dialtone
Yeah
Mula, can I get a million
'Til the heads or tails
'Til I get a full coin
Full fledge, full house
When your friend gon' join?
Got a friend in the cut with a gun by the groin
And what are friends for
I’m still the boss, don’t get sent for
Roger that, 10-4
Nigga send me, point 'em out
Where he at, I got 'em
We don't wanna see you back in court
The weed so loud bitches get ignored
Cause I ain't got time to go back and forth
I told that bitch don't question me
Bitch, if you do you asking for it

Feeling like A-rod after ‘roids

And I don't mean basketball, when I say I don't know Yao

Play with my money money money: O.K. Corral

I'm a paper chasin' dog, check my toenails
And I never miss a game, no Shaq O'Neal
More like Brett Favre,
 
just like Brett Favre
I been shot two times; just wipe that off
But I thank you for putting me right back, Lord
And to you, Father, I would give my life back for it

Make ya so-called soldiers just run like Gore
Yeah, Frank that is, from San Francis

Ten addresses and I dresses

And I'm about to bubble and she catch that fizz
And I'm straight from Claiborne, nigga; just ask Liz
Check ya neck, there ain't a crook like this
From the city where the judge throw the book at kids
Burner in school, in my bookbag hid
Talk stupid at lunch and we havin' ya ribs
If you are not home, then we havin' ya kids
And if you can't come up with half, I'll send ya half of ya kid
Back to the board, an extravagant crib
I'm on the toilet watchin' Martin, just laughin' and shit
Don't know why I get high, but I get high
I get high like every single day
We do shit that them other women can't
Mary Jane, what is it you've done to me?
I pop a beat and start rollin'
And then I smoke it like a muthafuckin' stogie
Peep how I wrote it, 
I was rappin to the

I need all my funds, yeah, all my money baby
Black diamonds and pearls
, believe that
I made bling bling
 and 
my chest look like a mural
I'm nuts, just call me Squirrel

My fetish is the girls, but the women, not the girls
Act your age, not your shoe size, maybe we can do the twirl
I'll be the Prince of her Pearl-tongue, earring in her pearl-tongue
If she come, let her girl come, give her a pill, give her girl one
Party time, excellent, yup, Wayne's World
Campbell's soup on the wrist, just call me Earl
Lil' Marl, don't shoot em, ya heard?
I get high, my words slur, I start callin 'em Merle
Hey, Merle, light that firre
And I know this old, but I'm really ""Hot in Herre""
I went with the Phantom, my niggas coppin' the spurs
My hand's in the pot, I'd rather eat and stir

It's I against the world, and I'm strapped... yeah
I bring all my guns... shoot mothers, fathers, babies, damn!
Black hand guns to serve, we could see
But we are so blind to the signs they tryin' to lose the world
And we will walk right up with our guns, yup, hand n' hand, yeah
We'll march right after the

Bitch I won the race

All I ever wanted was to tell her she was all I ever wanted
Wake up to her every morning, last night we can't recall it
Every day she catchin' feelings, every night I throw a party
She done died and went to heaven, I forgot to close the coffin
I'm just lookin' for lil sexy to direct me from the horror
They ain't promisin' tomorrow but she promisin' she loyal
So I promise to be faithful
Yeah, Lil Weezy; ""F"" for ""Faithful, Funky, Freaky, Freshly Flavored

I just tell my main ting ""Since you my main ting
You can turn your phone off and let your name ring
We can take them clothes off and let that thang breathe
Hold me as I doze off, you know I drank lean""

I just poured a whole deuce inside a 16
Cried my whole heart out, she cried with me
She like to put the top down and tell me ""Let 'em see""
She like to leave the doors up, they look like referees
She like to throw it back until she got back pains
She got her own little special contact name
She take it in the ass, ain't worryin' 'bout the crack game
Me, her, plus another bitch, she don't care if the math change
Yeah, I just poured a whole deuce inside a 16
Got her reppin' suwoo, she reppin' big Bs
And she ain't worryin' 'bout fuckin' on a private plane
And she don't do the phone thing, she do the finer things
It's all about deserving things and not designer things
She all about her certain ring and not all kind of rings
All about the sure things and not the shiny things
Man, she so tired of swervin' niggas, need a tire chain

All I ever wanted was to tell her she was all I ever wanted
Wake up to her every morning, last night we can't recall it
She lay down and close her eyes, fall asleep open hearted
She done died and went to heaven, I forgot to close the coffin
I'm just lookin' for lil' sexy to direct me from the sorrow
They ain't promisin' tomorrow but she promise to be loyal
So I promise to be faithful, but I'm prolly not gon' chase you
Sit down on my dinner table, eat that pussy like it's catered

I just tell my main ting ""Since you my main ting
You can turn your phone off and let your name ring
You can scratch yo' goals off and you can thank me
Hold me as I doze off, you know I drank lean""
I just told my main thing ""Since you my main thing
Let them have the fame thing 'cause it's the same thing
You can take them clothes off and let that thang breathe
Hold me as I doze off, you know I drank lean""

I just poured a whole deuce inside a 16
Yeah she reppin' two countries, yeah she mixed breed
Got her smokin' rapper weed, tryna spit Vs
She been goin' 30 minutes, she just switched knees
Uh, pimpin' ain't easy but it's necessary
Pimpin' ain't dead, check the cemetery
If I tell you that I love you, I ain't lying girl
So worry 'bout yourself and not the other bitch I'm tellin'

All I ever wanted was to tell her she was all I ever wanted
Wake up to her every morning, last night was all recorded
Every day she catchin' feelings, every night I throw a party
That's that ""Fire and Desire"", I forgot to throw her water
I'm just lookin' for lil' sexy to direct me from the horror

I’m A Go Getta,UnKnown,2009.0,"Michael Phelps, this for you, baby!

I'm goin' for the gold, my heart is in control
My mind is on succeed and I am in the lead
Don't buy into the schemes, the science or strategy
Just giant N-U-Ts brings triumph and belief
I'm a lion or a dean, 
inspired by the green
Never tired or fatigued, never defiant to my team
Never lying on the thing until I'm lying on the thing
Hooked to wires and things; I'ma die as a king
If I don't do it now, I'ma try it again
And when I do accomplish it, I'ma try it again
I'm a riot, insane; 
I'm a lion, my mane
Hangs down to my strings and they're tied to the game
I stay dry when it rain, I'm tired of the fame
Got everything to gain and I'm proud of the pain
The pride and the plain, the wise and the strange
Denied by the sane; besides, we're the same
Who's guiding the train? Who's flyin' the plane?
Who's driving the lane? 
Who dies when it bang?
Who fires when it bang? Who lies in the aim?
Two lives in the drain
; 
who cries when they sang?
You hide but you can't; you high but you ain't
I advise you to think; you'll find what you can't
Revive what you taint, survive what you paint
Super-size what you shrank: 
the fries and the drank
Admired as a saint, defined by my rank
Combined with my strength, my time and my length
I'ma iron out the kinks; yes, I'm on the brink
And in the eye of my wink, I'ma retire in the bank

Yeah, and 
I'm no quitter
'Cause I'm a go, I'm a go, I'm a go getta
And I'm no quitter
'Cause I'm a go, I'm a go, I'm a go getta
Yeah, I'm gon' get it, I'm gon get it
Yeah, I'm gon' get it, yeah
'Cause I'm a go, I'm a go, I'm a go getta

Victory consistantly
Train all year to be the enemy's misery
No stress visibly, neither does it enter me
I think positively; you can't harm me mentally
Not physically, not spiritually; you'll never get rid of me
I am the epitome of ""this is what you did to me""
Nothin's what you did for me, nothin's what you give to me
I take whatever I'm visualizing, now break all of the limiting
Now shake all of the gimicking, the fakery, the trickery
""Nurse, how sick is he?"" ""Worse, I am sickening!""
I'll be at the finish line first, ""how quick is he?""
I'ma make sure they mention me for the next century
I ain't with the bickering, I am full of dignity
I am full of energy, pull out the inner me
Or bull after dinner meat, I stood in the winter heat
It could be the end of me, but good be defending me

Yeah, and 
I'm no quitter
'Cause I'm a go, I'm a go, I'm a go getta
And I'm no quitter
'Cause I'm a go, I'm a go, I'm a go getta
Yeah, I'm gon' get it, I'm gon get it
Yeah, I'm gon' get it, yeah
'Cause I'm a go, I'm a go, I'm a go getta

I'm allergic to cheatin'
I hate failure and I'm in love with achievement
Above and beneath it, a hug when I greet it
My eyes on the prize and I love when I seek it
Done with the speakin', begun with the preachin'
Now pray, until I am one with the deacon
Now play, until I have won whatever we win
I play, until I have won, and then I re-win

Yeah, and 
I'm no quitter
'Cause I'm a go, I'm a go, I'm a go getta
And I'm no quitter
'Cause I'm a go, I'm a go, I'm a go getta
Yeah, I'm gon' get it, I'm gon get it
Yeah, I'm gon' get it, yeah

Yellow PT Cruiser, yellow 'Lac on rims
Drop yellow 'Vette and a platinum Rolls Royce
That's seven different cars, everyday I got a choice
On my way to pick up Joyce, she be making me moist
Giving me head while she humming, she can play with her voice
And she got nice thighs, a big plump ass
She could ride a dick too, make me cum fast
I like them modeling bitches, I love them swallowing bitches
Where them hoes headed at? I'm 'bout to follow them bitches (let's go)
I know you with your folks, but that nigga is broke
You might as well open your legs up and let a nigga poke
I'm a show you what it is not to be a window shopper
Mama you can have Fendi, mama you can have Prada
All you gotta do is break a nigga off proper
You could be with your man, I ain't tryna stop ya

With them twenty-two inch chopper blades
Diamond face, diamond brace
More colors than the game Simon Says
Go, 'hind me
And mami on forty-fifth she told me ""I'm a lez""
And she ain't like too much of dick
But give the bombest head, and so I took it anyway
But bitch I got a Phantom, don't need your pussy anyway
OK, let's talk about this ice that I'm carryin'
All these karats like I'm a fucking vegetarian
Niggas play, I bury them, y'all already knowin'

Catch 'em solo, they geezy, don't shock me dog
Well get the fuck, slide on out the way
And let B.G. ease down the shinin' linen
Let the diamonds and the jewelry light shit up
Each piece of jewelry I own, I ice it up
You don't wanna put your vehicle next to us

Stop Playin With Me,Funeral,2020.0,"(
Chill Stump on the beat
)

Ooh, I got a plus sized model
But she my lil' mama
I make her bust it open for me like a piñata
And as the world turned, she was my spin doctor
'Cause when I was down, you all got lost on me like Bin Laden
I know that times changed, I don't think I've changed
I changed my mind a bunch of times, but that's just mind games
Baby, stop playin' with me
Do I look like I'm playin' with you?
I was runnin' from myself, and that's just who I ran into
Closed my eyes last night and had a dream I was dyin'
When I woke up, I was surprised, and I hate surprises
I hate to love, they love to hate, but when it's all synchronizin'
It feel just like the flames have died up in this cold state of mind
Promethazine tranquilizers as I say my goodbyes
Paid them no mind, and as I wait for my receipt
I just got my face tatted and it felt orgasming
I got on a straightjacket, then it must be fashion week
I just look like this, ho, don't be comparin' me
Shit is so embarrassing, low-key flattering
They'd rather battle royale, way before they battle me
Long live my skateboard and rest in peace to Adam Z
Motherfucker, stop playin' with me

Stop playin' with me, bitch, stop playin' with me
Stop playin' with me, bitch,
 it's been a long time
For a long time
Time sure flies but it's on a long flight
No I don't need air time 'cause I got hang time
You think it's play time? Well bitch, it's game time
And you gon' stop playin' with me
Stop playin' with me, bitch, stop playin' with me

Ooh, I've been feelin' like a killer since the diapers
I've been feelin' like a hitter since the minors
Sticky icky like a itsy bitsy spider
They say to be or not to be, bitch, I'm indecisive
I'm in the buildin' like the interior designer
You in your feelings like a bitch when she get her cycle
Ain't that a bitch, ain't that a bitch? I'm yellin', ""Please don't wife her""
Dwayne Carter, niggas wanna be the DC sniper
Well, fuck it, I'm thuggin' on the low, I'm ballin' on the high
I'm fuckin' on the floor, she can crawl but can't hide
I'm Bloodin' with my bros, goin' hard with my slimes
It ain't nothin' to a GOAT but the roar of a lion
Jungle book, ho, it's another book show
No car keys needed, button push, go
We gon' ghost ride in the whip, then she believe in ghosts
I'ma snowplow on that bitch until she freezin' cold
She gon' slope style on the dick until she eat the snow
Put my foot down in this bitch, these niggas twinkle toes
Nigga, sit down, you a bitch, I heard your seat unfold
Way up in the nosebleeds, hold your head back, squeeze your nose

Nigga, stop playin' with me
Stop playing with me
It's been a long time, a long time
Long, long time since she loved me long time
Told her stop playin' with me
Stop playin' with me
No, I don't need air time 'cause I got hang time
You think it's play time? Well then it's game time
You gon' stop playin' with me
Stop playin' with me, bitch, stop playin' with me
Stop playin' with me, bitch
Yes, I've been on time, for a long time
And time sure flies, but it's on a long flight
And you gon' stop playin' with me, yeah",https://genius.com/Lil-wayne-stop-playin-with-me-lyrics

Get with it!

Squad poppin' like the Pentagon
Squad poppin' like the renaissance
Squad poppin' like the Thriller song
And you pussy ass niggas thrill is gone
My squad lit like a strobe light
Squad lit on a slow night
Squad ain't got no type
Cinderella, Pocahontas, Snow White
My squad poppin', my bitch shoppin'
My niggas thuggin', my bitch robbin'
I'm inside cuddlin' with the chopper
Workin' on the stove, like a novel
Diggin' in my pockets, tryna find the bottom
Codeine got the drink all soggy
And your queen got my dick hard body
There's a stick up in my drawers, armed robbery
My squad poppin' like the white house
Squad never need time out
Squad way up on the ninth cloud
Way up here we got iCloud
My squad lit like a strobe light
Every night, any night, all night
6 hoes and they all dykes
And all they need is one mic
My new attic full of dead bodies
Old attic full of dead bodies
Bedroom full of red bodies
I got your main bitch headlinin'
She cry to me, said ""You're no fair""
Cried to me, said ""You're low fare""
Dry pussy with no hair
So we showered together and the soap fell
Then I ask her how the dope feel
I don't care how the ho feel
I kick her ass out the dope house
And she can ask her ass how the door feel
Squad pop like the Pentagon
Thot talk like Jenny Jones
Smokin' loud like an intercom
I'ma keep it summer all winter long
Squad lit like the sunlight
You gon' have to squint or use one eye
No Mike Tyson, this a gun fight
Had to hide my guns 'cause they gun-shy
Squad pop like the Pentagon
Had to put a few killers on
If you don't want no static
You gon' have to put some antennas on
Wait, drop-top with the titties on
Bitch bounce like a tennis ball
Pussies hatin' like menopause
Its a jungle out there, Senegal
Wait, drop-top with the tinteds on
It get ugly when I'm pretty stoned
Fat pockets with the skinnies on
I'm dead right, but I'm livin' wrong
No red lights, my limits gone
My meds right, I'm Trippy Jones
My wave right like Billabong
My diamonds dance like Diddy Combs
Her headlights, I turn 'em on
She wanna go to Mars, that journey long
I'm gon' fuck her hard 'til her sternum gone
My diamonds sing, she learn the songs
I woke up, like this ho
I'm burnin' pot like Crisco
She a Crip ho but she a nympho
And we color blind, and you know love is blind
In each other's eyes, we butterflies
Rock and roll like Hummer tires
I don't even got to be her number 1
I'm her number 6 and she my number 9
Get it?
All these drugs scientific
All these boys science fiction
Softer than a flying ribbon
Walkin' all 9 innings
Talkin' shit while I'm shittin'
Defecation expensive
Destination exquisite
Dedication 6th senses
I'm the shit up in the restroom
Guess who up in my guest room
Smack her ass, leave a flesh wound
Weezy F. Baby, test tube
The Martian get high as Neptunes
I fuck your bitch, how is that news?
And you ain't shit to a raccoon
I go ape-shit on these baboons
The diamonds still doin' dance moves
The money still makin' fast moves
6 feet or 3 pair of shoes
You still underground where the grass grew
Headshot, that's a hairdo
Blood drop like shampoo
Young Vidal Sassoon
Oh well, no Shamu
She clap her ass and the lamp blew
We catch your ass gettin' fast food
It happen fast, then we vamoose
Rat-a-tat-ta-ta-tat, poof
I go Apple Jack to the Froot Loop
I got milk, sauce, and the Ragu
From the body on the side walk
I chucked to the chalk in this kids classroom
Six shit

Craziest shit Drake ever bought me as a gift was um probably some, some jewelry or something like Drake buy real extravagant gifts like so, I don't, you know, forgive me for saying I don't remember but it's like the gift be so extravagant meaning like I probably use it every day so when you use something everyday you totally forget who got that shit for you,I 'm sorry you just do.  and so he get you those type of gifts when I say extravagant I mean like uh the house I probably live in was probably bought by Drake you know what I mean shit like that",https://genius.com/Lil-wayne-sick-lyrics

It's get rich, go to jail, or be a murder victim

I feel like a Black Republican, tote the MAC in the public
AndAct so southern n' die for my brethren

One life to live, never ask for a mulligan
Streets cold but the heat make me feel covenant
Been had cake, you late like Ed Sullivan
Fly like an eagle, but no, I'm not Donovan
Boy, you better go eat some soup with your mama 'nem
And my mind is on another continent
I am real Cash Money, no counterfeit
I don't parking-lot pimp, I just politick
But I get all in her mouth like Polident
New Orleans representer to the inner
Come from the city where the glitter don't glimmer
The sun don't shine, and the guns don't sleep

Like a mack in a suit
Still on my toes
Not a crack in my shoe
Rappers talking 'bout me
But I don't give a hoot
These niggas still lying
I'm the motherfucking truth
Talk tough
'Til I knock off your kuf
And I own my team
I'm like a Maloof
They hating on me
I'm just trying to be Weezy
Just like Young Jeezy
In a lima bean 'Ghini
Smoked out my mind, baby
Now I'm seeing 3-D
Dope boy fresh

""You can't sleep on life""
So he popped a X pill
And didn't sleep all night
I ain't worrying 'bout you

Last album did two
I'm just trying do three
I am what every pair of eyes ought to see
Bitches wish they could just call and order me
My Momma used to tell me ""Get a nine-to-five""
Cash Money made her say ""Never mind, I'm fine""

Cry Out,Unreleased Songs,2016.0,"Yea... Yea
Yes
Ima call this here... real rap
Cause this rap is real... ya know?
I hope you ain't too tired to cry
And I hope you know you ain't never too live to die
Listen

I grew up where them people called them people on us
Think we slangin, but we just got beepers on us
Grindin' all day like we got sleep insomnia
Livin' like the videos write a treatment on us
Stuck in the hood like they put cement on us
Ghetto birds still shittin on us, government still quittin' on us
Lost a few homies and the grief still sittin on us
So we got the names writtin on us
White folks still spittin' on us
And them bitch ass police canines, teeth still grittin' on us
But we smoke, ashes still gettin' on us
Older bitches still hittin' on us
I remember well, Beezy roll the L
Beezy ain't here... where's Beezy at?... Beezy got killed
And that was my nigga, I go way back wit my nigga
But I know thats how it happened my nigga
Shit is much deeper than this rappin my nigga
But now they all rappin, my niggas, so now I must make it happen
So I'mma play the captain, sail boat flappin my nigga
No fingas I'm snappin', happy for my nigga Lil' Tiggas
Cause even though we couldn't, The Lord saved him
Last time we seen him was when Katrina hated
Found his body like a month later, Rest in Peace boy
He was a East boy, and so was Wesy West
He was a good nigga, so I know he blessed
And his daughter is a princess
This shit is harder than a bench press
But I'mma keep goin, and I swear I got a lump in my throat
But I'mma keep on pumpin the flow
So if I cry dont stop the beat
I feel like my heart just stopped the beat
My nigga Lil' Derrick is quick to cop a key
Either that or load the gat and go pop a G
And because of that he's just a name in a rhyme of mine
I pray his family and his mama fine
So much shit just sit on this mind of mine
I think about it all the time
I drink about it all the time
I smoke back to back
Cause if my thoughts got to me I'd be in this rap
Or I'd be in the can, thank God I had dreams of being the man
Yea
And fuck a man with a badge
Cause he ain't shit to a man on the edge
The five o killed naughty good boy dead
Man you woulda thought they killed corn bread
Shot 'em up face down on the lawn
Not to mention with his handcuffs on
Not to mention they had plain clothes on
And the complaint goes on
But don't nobody do nothin' bout it
The jailhouse and the morgue is too fuckin' crowded
And haters at an all time high
Everybody gotta hate, it's like a fuckin iPod
Shit and they tried to burn my phantom up
But I got my gun license, I got my hammers up
I'm ready to shoot like a camera
Stay still mothafucka I'mma have to write my will this summer
Cause if they don't kill me, I'mma kill this summer
Yea
And you can put that on my late father
Or my late grandmother, Ms. Mercedes Carter
Or my grandfather Larry Bosock
The old man hustle 'till his heart stopped
And all I know 'bout my real pops is that he had money
No bank account, that brown paper bag money
Yea he might hit me off wit a little brag money
But the nigga still wouldn't be a dad for me
But look how I turned out I hope he glad for me
But thats why when I see him I acts mad funny -
Cause he's a joke to me
Don't message, don't call, don't talk to me
It's just me and my mama how it's suppose to be
And I make sure she paid like she wrote for me
And I know she gets all hope for me
And 
I don't ever want to see her mope for me
Hopefully, but truthfully there is a day that's due for me
But we gone pray it's as far as the future sees
You are listenin' to the future Wee-zy F. Baby
Amen",https://genius.com/Lil-wayne-cry-out-lyrics

Got my bandanna 'round my head and pants to my feet
And got my eyes fire red and Glock on my seat

Cause I lost my father, and got a daughter, plus I'm on probation
I'm drinkin liquor like it's water, gettin pissy drunk
And stayin away from them lil' broads they tryna get me stomped keep a chopper in the trunk and my heat on my waistline
Duckin the law, cause I ain't tryna' do no Fed time
Sometimes I just wish I could be away
But I gotta take care of Ginae and keep Ms. Cita straight
So I just maintain the struggle and I keep tryin
But how can I when my closest people keep dyin'

And now she trippin talkin 'bout I need to be in church
And my lil' girl whole family tryna lie in court

And whole family deny me of what I do cause I'm a 'thug and stuff'
Plus, my niggas keep fallin to them drugs and stuff
That dope got these niggas meltin' away
Man they got clowns right around me, killin' they self everyday
We keep fightin' but they so strong

And grab ya nuts and let 'em know that we don't give a fuck

Dawg I swear it's very rough out here for the youngstas
Like everybody against me cause I'm a young thug
Dear Rabbit, why they have to kill Rabbit?
But I'mma keep you alive, nigga, I'm Lil Rabbit
That's why this lil' nigga be buggin like it's no tomorrow
I only can depend on macita and C-M-R
I try my best to make it through the night and live today
But I'm upset so I'm steady wipin' tears away
And police got me under surveillance when and wherever
Wrecking they brains, tryna' figure where I'm gettin that cheddar
I tell my family just leave me a-damn-lone
I can handle all'a my business, this lil' man grown
But I try to forget about it and just stand strong
But if everythang was cool I wouldn't write this damn song
Fuck the world

Hit Em Up,Tha Carter II,2005.0,"Yeah
I tried talk to him

Quit talking, I’ma hang you by your tongue, yeah
Any motormouth could get hung high
We don’t fuck with niggas, like fungi, we don’t even hear ya
Hollering bullshit, nigga, cut the diarrhea
(Get 'em!) Pistol lie inside of the arm rest, umm, yes
Lay a nigga down in his own mess, don’t mess
Player fuck around with the homeless, charmless
You can leave out here armless, no homies
(Go!) Honest, you niggas is harmless
I’m calm as a Don is supposed to (be), Cosa Nostra
Don’t ever approach him, don’t get close to him
Shootouts ain’t nothing but rock-n-roll to him
Leave your blood on the dash, call it rosewood
‘Nother murder, ‘nother page out the notebook
It ain’t nothing, and don’t make it if you no good
I tried to talk to him, but then a nigga had to

Hit ‘em up, hit ‘em up
I ain’t even wanna hit ‘em up, really I was tryna be calm
But uh, that chopper rock, put his head in his arms
And man, I tried to talk to him, I tried to talk to him
Hit ‘em up, hit ‘em up
I ain’t even wanna hit ‘em up, fuck it, make a nigga get loose
He had too much talk and not enough proof
I tried to talk to him, I tried to talk to him
Hit ‘em up, hit ‘em up
I ain’t even wanna hit ‘em up, hit ‘em up
I ain’t even wanna hit ‘em, but I hit ‘em up (Gunshot)
I tried to talk to him, I tried to talk to him

(Y’all) Take them shoes off your teeth, stop runnin’ your mouth
No shoes, no feet, I’ll run in your mouth
I’ll come to your house, me and my goons
Loading up bangers, riding under the moon
Throwing up fingers, saying, “My side rule”
If a nigga disagree, that’s what my side prove
That Maybach Coupe a cock-eyed fool
And I’m in it like Bennett, ho, aren’t I cool
But if the thermostat switch and that needle move
Then the attitude switch and that heat’ll move
I got that Chiquita banana clip for the tool
Meet a disaster, pity the fool
Eat a catastrophe, swallow the truth, belch reality
How does it taste? Powder your face, you a bitch nigga
All pussy, stop coming out your lips, nigga
I tried to talk him, but then a nigga had to

Hit ‘em up, hit ‘em up
I ain’t even wanna hit ‘em up, really I was tryna be calm
But uh, that chopper rock, put his head in his arms
And man, I tried to talk to him, I tried to talk to him
Hit ‘em up, hit ‘em up
I ain’t even wanna hit ‘em up, fuck it, make a nigga get loose
He had too much talk and not enough proof
I tried to talk to him, I tried to talk to him
Hit ‘em up, hit ‘em up
I ain’t even wanna hit ‘em up, hit ‘em up
I ain’t even wanna hit ‘em, but I hit ‘em up
(Gunshot) I tried to talk to him, I tried to talk to him

Real talk, boy, chill with the talk, boy (yeah)
That Tommy gun’ll tear your neighborhood apart, boy (blatt!)
Yeah, leave your feelings in your heart, boy
You start with the wrong boy, it end with a song, boy (oh)
With your friends to carry you along
To a concrete mattress and a fluffy tombstone (yeah)
Fuck the discussion, I ain’t into it, boy
I just get to it, let’s do it, rip through a boy (bah!)
Big Uzi, just shoot a boy
I’m inside looking out, you just an intruder, boy (get em!)
You need sutures on your smoochers, boy, but
I tried to talk to him, but then a nigga had to

Hit ‘em up, hit ‘em up
I ain’t even wanna hit ‘em up, really I was tryna be calm
But uh, that chopper rock, put his head in his arms
And man, I tried to talk to him, I tried to talk to him
Hit ‘em up, hit ‘em up

Ride me like a horse, Bitches call me Charlie.
Swear to god, I never met a nigga with enough money
I'm riding around in that new thing with no roof like a hush puppy.

Better ask 'bout us, we been a fool
Shot of weed with the one with the pounds of the weed
And the quarter keys of middle school
Beeper, sneakers, tennis shoe, that’s all we was hustling for
When I pull this strap, you don't do what I say
Nigga that's what I would bust it for
I don't take your shit, ain't nothing, bruh
What's all the discussion for?
I'm the motherfucking king and I'm doing my thing
Ain't my fault you can't fuck with us
You know a counterfeit case make years in prison
Got back out, got back to getting busy
Keep playing 'round with it, on the real you can get it
Let a goon get a quarter mil', that'll kill it
Couple racks on that Versace suit
Just in case they watching fool
Sophisticated, my surveillance pics just like a photoshoot
Givenchy, Balenciaga, YSL and Prada
Tom Ford, LonBon, you name it, I got it

Literally 'cause I'm menaging when the feds watching, ha!

Weezy Baby, y'all
Don't get shot
Rapid fire, what you know bout it?
I brought my homie along for the ride
He strapped, he getting ready to come out the back room
Rob!

I heard some shouts, like, ""Down on the floor!"" (bow!)
Then—even louder—""We got shooters (yeah), shooters! (yeah)""
I turn around, I was staring at chrome (hello!)
Shotgun watches door, got security good (check!)
Jumped right over counter, pointed gun at, wink
He tell her, ""I'm your shooter, shooter, shooter"" (let's go!)

My hands up (yeah!), my hands up (yeah!)
They want me with my hands up
Oh, ""Shooter!""
My hands up (yeah!), my hands up (yeah!)
They want me with my hands up
Oh, ""Shooter!"" (get 'em, yeah!)

So many doubt cause I come from the South
But when I open up my mouth, all bullets come out
Bang! Die, bitch-nigga, die! I hope you bleed a lake
I'mma play x-ray, helping y'all see the fake
I'm just trying to be the Great, trying to get a piece of cake
Take it off of your plate, eat it right in your face
They got a whole lot to say but I don't listen
Call me Automatic Weezy, bitch, I keep spittin', pow!

All these bitches and, all these bitches!
But ain't no lovers around
They thinking about shooting! Them shooters
Got the guns, girls. Ladies, them gunners that
Shoot shoot shoot shoot! Shooters!

My hands up, my hands up
They want me with my hands up
Oh, ""shooter!""
My hands up, my hands up
They want me with my hands up
Oh, ""shooter!""

And to the radio stations, I'm tired of being patient
Stop being rapper racists, region-haters
Spectators, dictators, behind door dick-takers
It's outrageous! You don't know how sick you make us
I want to throw it up like chips in Vegas
But this is Southern, face it
If we too simple, then y'all don't get the basics

Lady walks into a shotgun surprise
Dropped to her knees, saw her life before her eyes
He said: ""bitch is gonna get it, everybody gon' regret it
I'm your - shooter!""

My hands up, my hands up
They want me with my hands up
Oh, ""shooter!""

Socks soaking wet, I been running y'all, I reload
Every hundred yards, I'm comin' forward
You better know me, Lil Wayne, just call me Lord, hard
Take pain like Tylenols, raw, way past par
Far, I'm some shit you never saw
I take you to the shootout, baby, win, lose, or draw
And then they ask who, when, where, how, and
My reply was simply, ""Pow!"" C'mon!

Mama, I tink dat, ay!
Me tink dey want me to surrender!
No! No, I'm sayin'
Mama, I tink dey, ay!
Me tink dey want me to surrender!
No, no, me won't surrender

We do our own thing, we don't act like y'all

We don't breed them kind, but they bleed just fine

If ya can't, boy, read my nine
I'm going hard in the paint like Diesel time
Either I'm the illest cat doing it or these cats is losing it

Pallbearer is moving his dead flow, I'm through with it
I'm the sh--naw, naw, I'm sewer-rich
Weezy F Baby, I do's this



An old school gangsta, mack like the 80s
I look like Cita and act like Baby
You play with me, I react like the navy
Or better yet the army, you gon' need them for me
Yeah, and your head is a bleeping target
You don't want me to see you with my peeping Tommys
Wizzle Fizzle, I keep in New Orleans
Sleeping with women that sleep with the Hornets
A country boy in something foreign
'Bout a hundred thousand more than what you're in
You're not 'bout it, you freeze up like popsicles
Pop up on bicycles, pop y'all like spot pimples
Wizzle Fizzle, original Hot Bizzle
Still Lil Wayne, but the dividend's not little
Don't be surprised how the crown fit him

I'm all about the money, what the fuck you think I do it for?
Bitch don't act like you don't know, I'm killin all these rap niggas
Custom made caskets for yo' motherfuckin funeral
Keep the women with me, shit I gotta keep like two or more
Party everyday, like we won the fuckin Super Bowl
Chillin wit my nigga Mack, he keep bitches handy
White girl on the table, let 'em sniff the nose candy
When I'm walkin by, the women sayin, ""Who is that nigga?""
I replied, ""Hi, I am Gudda Gudda, that nigga!""
I was raised in the home of the cap splitters
Whip on 24's, watch it crawl like a caterpillar
I come with a toy boy like a Happy Meal
And you's a motherfuckin duck, Daffy Dill
I'm from the school of hard knocks, where we scrap and kill
Pick the knife or gun or you can get the package deal
I'm hot nigga, burnin everything around me
I was lost for a minute, took a while but I found me
The streets say I'm king but the game'll never crown me
Realest nigga doin it just ask the niggas 'round me
So you cain't size me up or try to clown a-

My pockets on fat like Joey Cartagena
Stunt so hard, it's all y'all fault
And when it come to beef, give me A1 Sauce
I ain't worryin 'bout shit, everything paid out
You could catch me courtside in Dwayne Wade house
With a high yellow thick bitch wit her legs out
Cash Money president, but we in a red house
Who the fuck want it? Make my fuckin day
I blow your candles out, now nigga cut the cake
I gotta eat, bitch! Like a runaway
Y'all niggas ain't eatin, stomach ache
Okay, all these bitches, and niggas still hatin
I used to be ballin, but now I'm Bill Gatein
Fuckin with my iPhone, bumpin' Illmatic

Hit ya baby mama and the house door
We making house calls, I'm an outlaw, in the south ward
Knock your ass out if you talk stupid
Got a big dick so I walk stupid
She got that hit-it-quick-in-the-car booty
Hold on, bad hoes need to get a raise, lame niggas tryna get away
But all ya diamonds need to get appraised, you in the way
Too many nights I was out lurking, mind in a daze, nowadays
I'm on Ocean Drive with a bad bitch lyin' in the shades
Sipping Minute Maid, gotta penetrate, let me demonstrate
Got the Jones soda with the drink in it
Got a backwood with the dank in it
Party ain't popping if we ain't in it
Go Blake Griffin, might flex on 'em
That's too much sauce, I bet them hoes know who I are
They treat a nigga like a superstar and that's what I am
I got your bitch but that's my bitch
So that's our bitch and that's all cool
When you trip out, wan' dip out, she just call me and I fall through
And that's bad news, hold these nuts, cashews
Vroom, I flew past you, new whips here, what the bags do
Past cool, young Jones

My enemies should get a good breakfast and a cup of coffee
I know refugees that don't rush things, they kill 'em softly
My closet still got Nike boxes and a couple corpses
Look, even though I'll never sell my soul, I got a couple offers
Don't think about it, I smoke about it, I drink about it
They wrap the body, then rap about it
Sink the body, then sing about it, zip the body, then sip about it
Fuck the world, I'ma still get some cool things up out it
If a CEO wanna dance all in my videos, I need a big deposit
Swerve, swerve, I'm back on 'em
My bad, I'm turning my back on 'em
I fuck, then see if Tune, Jay Jones, Hoody, or Mack want 'em
Real shit, I've seen good girls go to airports with that pack on 'em
Trill shit, I've seen bad bitches with good genes but I slack on 'em
I ain't focused there, Gotham City, got Batmans and Jokers there
I'm in the club but I'm in the cut

I'm magical with chemicals and smashing stuff, Metallica
Satanical like Skeletor, you greener than a salad bar
I leave from here to Africa to read some Maya Angelou
Impractical, you acting all DiCaprio; we trap and go for casserole
We back and forth in traffic with that Macklemore
That magic snow, it's always cold and my freak on that molly water
I met this bitch on Collins but she out the hood, her mama cook
I'm on the way, I'm on a stage, the Magic show, I feel like Dave
I walk on water, float in air, I'm over there, I'm in your face
I pop up out of nowhere, bop-bop at your doorbell
Disappear in thin air, all we leave is smoke there
Smoking roadkill, she on coke here
Stash is sticking to her nosehair
I'm a magician in the motel, moving tricks for wholesale
Hold on, abracadabra, the data don't matter
We rata-ta-ta-ta over the chatter, we got mo ammo than grammar
Hammers and hammers, pull up in Lambos
Shoot up the cameras, die in pajamas
Find you with Sam and your wife and your mamas

It's the Carter motherfucker, I came back around
It's the Carter motherfucker
Let me show you my building man, it's the Carter
I'ma show y'all the ins the outs, the ups the down, know what I'm talking 'bout
This is me, fourth solo album baby, I came back around
By myself this time, back off the wall
Guns up in the air in the middle of the street like bang, bang, bang bang, welcome

Welcome, this is the Carter y'all welcome
Hard as Malcolm, 
dark as The Falcon,
 Lord help him
But y'all felt him, and that make you a part of me and pardon me
If a part of me is what you wanna be what you oughta be
Doing, recording me, I'm just acting accordingly, I give orders
To the commander in chief, just the commander in me
Handling streets in the Mandarin V
I hear you haters slandering me, I just hand 'em to P
Any drama, I pace it like Indiana
I take your grandma pacemaker and just hand her the piece
Not two fingers I simultaneously pop two bangers
You do not want angus, USDA prime beef, you're dead meat
I'm so ahead of these trendy rappers speed up
I'm already hot when another one starting to heat up
Got Mannie hot with me cuz I always beat his beat up
Y'all cats wit y'all feet up starting to look like V'd up
I'm G'd up on the re-up up, in the truck I gotta put my seat up
In the trunk I got my bass and I ain't speakin about no speakers
What's leaking up out of your speakers is the speech of Weezy F. Baby
No more no less Baby, so forth and so on, (let's go)
Front door, living room young nigga switching weed
What you need? Get you crack, get you weed
Make your way to the back, look ahead and see
White bitch in the bathroom giving head for speed
But don't you turn your head at me, the president been doin it
Then he tried to ruin it
, 
but I built this building from the ruts
I own all the corners and the cuts in this motherfucker
And the feds know just what's in this motherfucker
Made niggas so they can't bust in this motherfucker
So with that, let's keep it movin'
Onto the kitchen where my witches keep it brewin'
Uh huh, look at how my bitches do it
Bucky buck naked, look at all my bitches booties
They handle all my pharmaceutics
I got it from Promethazine to Metamucil
I'm crucial, don't mean to spook you
But, this is New Orleans, so my queens do voodoo, ya know?
So the things just move through
I feel your pain, I got things to soothe you
There's fields of 'caine, so Wayne and neutral
Don't hate the game hate the institution
There's fields of 'caine, so Wayne and neutral
Don't hate the game hate the institution, fucker

Shot to the Heart/Something You Forgot,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Since I've lost you I'm lost too
Niggas feeling like he at the bottom like a horse shoe
Sorry for the trouble that I put you and your heart too
God knows that I'll do anything for a part 2
Be prayin' for the day you come back to me
Sayin that you forgive me
Give me another chance I'm needing it like a kidney
I don’t want to advance
Give me back her hands give me back her touch
I don’t ask for much, but I fucked up
I know I fucked, I admit I fucked, but everybody fuck up
Now this other nigga lucked up
Tell him me and my clique don’t give a fuck
Cuz um, I'm from New Orleans, she was from Georgia
She was my down chick, I was a soldier
I was a gangsta, she was my shoulder
You were the pistol to my holster. Bang

You've been hiding, never letting it show
Always trying, to keep it under control (I see you hiding it mama)
You got it down, and you're well on your way to the top (You doin’ your thing)
But there's something that you forgot

You forgot about the house, you forgot about the ring
I remember everything, I just wanna hear you sing
I remember the love right after the fights
You can’t tell me you don’t remember those nights
And if I would cry, you would cry twice
To me you were the brightest star under sunlight
Take away my title, take away my stripes
You give me back my girl and you give me back my life
-Give me back my girl and you give me back my life-
See this is just a nightmare so I blink twice
Open up my eyes hoping she’d be in my sight
I remember the time I wish I can bring it back
What she means to me is what I mean to rap


But I hope u haven’t forgot about me
Up in the living room watchin sports center
You were cookin dinner, I was such a sinner
But the lord is a forgiver
You know they say if you pray then you can get your blessings ordered and delivered
And your boyfriend is not like me
Why "" Ma you even went and got a tear drop like me ""
I remember we would sit at home all day
You called me butter, I called you baby
My momma asked about you, my partners did too
I know your daughter will be so amazing like you
And I know you probably wish you never met me
And I just wish you never forget me
And let me say, please, don’t worry about the women I have been with
No engagement can amount to your friendship
And I hope that nigga know he got a queen
And all I can do is dream. Damn


I shed tears ‘cause I'm told that they’ll heal
To tell the truth I don’t know how to feel
Never felt alone in a room full of friends
Got big plans but you leave 'em in suspense
Pray for me, patience wait for me
Pay dues, trust me they ain't comin
Way back it was hoops, now it’s Maybach coupes
And we all took a vow, no squares in the loops
Now we lookin at each other, sittin in a court room I'm laughin, cause it’s lookin like a cartoon
Never snitch, got it tattood by kartoo?
(somebody switch) by my rules we all lose


Flippin' through magazines, ridiculed for my life
But they keep takin' pictures of my jewels in the light
Hundred g’s in the night, entertain big timers
Cause my one-liners rule these dynamers
Smellin' Rosé on my breath, an ex-brisco fell asleep in his bed
Habits we developed livin' lavish stackin' mail up
Clothes come from big n tall …………?
Got live life, I'm tryna live life
Penthouse for a pimp, only drove the Benz twice
Convertible to the cars, cause I murdered all of ours
Get fifty collect calls from dawgs behind bars


Fortune and fame are pleasures you couldn’t fathom
But fortunately for me my fortune built me a palace
Benjamins by the pallet, I'm spendin ‘em mighty daily
I know I'm under surveillance ( I look at it as a talent)
Millions I gotta manage, lil talents up in the rappin I'm such a threat to these n*ggaz (you never know what could happen)
I started without a coin, not knowin which way I'm goin
Now I'm chatering boeings n readin a few poems
Weathered all of the storms, now its time to see the light
And I never felt this way bout anything in my life
Determined to be the best, not lookin back at regrets

Feel Me,Tha Carter II,2005.0,"So ""Little Wayne,"" what's your motivation?

Is that really a question?
Do you really have that written down in your notepad?
You should be ashamed of yourself
You smell me girl
I smell like money
See, thats what they don't understand (Tell 'em a god damn thang)
To me it was always get money or die
I come up under Birdman, the Number One Stunna
You know what I mean I'm Stunna Jr. thats all I know thats all I ever knew
Get money or get nothing you know what I'm saying
And I feel that way
Foreal

So hard I go I keep pushing
The game so crazy I'm in it like deep pussy
I got chip from trying to get the whole cookie
Used to make a thousand dollars everytime I played hookie
Dwayne Carter absent keep looking
I'm present on the block
I'm a legend on the block
Ice so bright like heaven on the watch
Yea nigga I done dropped one eleven on the watch
So watch and see what I do
Breeze by you so fast got you sneezing hachoo
They got the shivers 'mayne I got the fever
I got to bring the hood back after Katrina
Weezy F Baby, now the 'F' is for FEMA
Sick nigga bitch I spit that Leukemia
Yea no cure no help
So me so good so hard so felt
Feel me

And that's just my point right there
That's what I'm always trying to stress know what I'm saying
If you don't understand me if you don't feel me then you ain't real
In my eyes, and that's all that count to me you know

So, is your music considered the voice of urban America or America period?

I mean, I would say the voice of the hood cause thats who I speak for
And myself, you know what I mean, my family thats who I represent
My homies, my girl, my life you know

C'mon, bang this shit nigga pump my shit
You gotta bang that wimp and go and dump that bitch
You gotta claim that strip and go and flood that bitch
You gotta aim that shit and straight bust that shit
Like motherfuck them niggas what they wan-do I'm ready
Tevin Campbell, no homo, black Rambo
Fucking with the boy baby that's a gamble
If he won in Vegas leave him on the crap table
I'm willing and I'm able to come run up in your stable
Like nobody make a sound where the paper where the paper
Gotta get it gotta have it
Once I got it I'mma spend it
Then its back to doing any damn thing just to get it
The re-ups be like birthday parties
No room to park the cars in the garages
So outside the cribs all you see is arayis
If I ain't say it right fuck it I ain't foreign
Feel me

And see thats where everybody get me wrong at, you know what I mean?
I got that heat rock, foreal

Why do you think other rappers lack the impact of your music?

Thats because they ain't got that heat rock like me you know what I mean
They ain't spitting like me
They spitting, but, know what I mean, they ain't got colds
I got the flu over here man, foreal
I need relief, y'all help me
I know y'all sick of me, cause I'm tired of y'all foreal

And based on the bank, I'm doing much better than alot of these niggas
I'm tired of these niggas
Yawning when I see them make me stretch and pull the burner
I'm cocking back and passing
They catch 'em in they sternum
Ooh ooh that gone probably burn ya
That gone probably learn ya
To never ever ever - ever ever ever come around here no more
Rich gangsters over here you gotta die with the broke bitch
I'm the God I should ride with the Pope
But the boy so hood I just ride with my ho yeah
Yeah, and tell 'em bout Hollygrove
Tell 'em bout my last show
Tell 'em bout my last ho
You know, just born to mack
Call me Deion Sanders, bring the corner back
I'm in my prime, niggas falling back
That's right I'm coming baby yeah hard as crack
Feel Me

And thats just what it is nigga
If you don't like my shit then fuck you and your shit man straight up
That's how I was taught, that's how I was brought up
And that's how I'mma go down
Cash-Money Young-Money in your motherfucking throat bitch
Swallow slow

Steph Curry, boy, I'll take the shot (Bop-bop)
Then I'll pull off and wave goodbye
I'm ready for the war, I'm not afraid to die

Them sticks go ""Boo-ya-ka""
Make a nigga say ""Uhh na-na-na-na-na""
I got money on my mental
Got them niggas in my rear view
I'm a dog, I'm a dog
Rottweilin' on these Shih tzu's
Drop dollars on your temple
Pop collars like a pistol
Drive back and forth for codeine
Put some mileage on the rental
Money talks like Jimmy Kimmel
Jimmy Fallon and Jay Leno
I'm straight N.O., the U-N-O
Fast life, so uptempo
Ooh-wee, Presidential
In the Backwood, eating Mentos
Smoke that loud like crescendos
Rep the Mob like De Niro
Fucking like a nympho
Save her info like a hero
Write your name on a bullet
She wrote my name on her dildo
Smoking on that kill though
Got me happier than Gilmo'

I just fucked your fucking ear hole

No ceilings, woah

Holler at them bitches, Lucci Lou

Give a fuck about you haters
More concerned with stacking paper
Smoking bog and sipping Lakers
Watch your girl 'cause I can take her
Drop the top, no ceilings
As I'm plottin' on millions
With my niggas in this bitch
They like ""Fuck it Lucci, get 'em""
I'm from that East side of New Orleans
Polo T's and Jordans
Where niggas dream to push foreigns
And all the hoes want ballers
I got the cheapest price on pearly white
If you need it, nigga, just call us
Long as you talking them dollars
I got it, nigga, just holler
Still no job – bitch, I ain't hurtin'
Put a ho on the stroll and told her ""Get to workin'""
She dropped a Xanny in his drink, the Rolly in her purse
Then brought it back to Daddy, man I swear this pimpin' work
I pop the clutch and hit the gas, I love the way it skrrt
She popped a bean and poppin' ass, can't keep it in her skirt
I beat it up, she eat it up, no feelings
It's Lucci Lou and Tunechi, nigga, no ceilings

No ceilings, bih, like an astronaut
Turk and Wayne back at it, nigga, we ain't gon' stop
Thuggin' nigga, it's thug life, 2Pac
My youngin with me, they stay strapped with two Glocks
I'm Molly turnt, but so uptown, throwing threes up like slime
Pussy nigga keep hating on me, keep hating, I ain't got time
Too busy chasing this paper, got money on my mind
Fuck you and your favors, know you seen my grind
I kicked the habit, never thought I could
That shit had me since fourteen
I was shooting up, nigga, on tour, fucking up my dreams
Fucking off my green, fucking off with these hoes
Could've died over a million times, I swear only God knows
Now I'm back nigga, like a hungry dog at the doorstep, let's eat
Tell you pussy niggas that slept on me
""Hope you bitches die in your sleep""
Free my brother BG
I'ma scream the shit til he hit the streets
Til my brother Ralo RIP, I got that nigga

I fuck a clit up on everything
I put some sip up in everything
You hit your bitch up, she never came
She was with me up in Neverland
I hit your clique up and everything
I take two clips up in everything
I'm coming, I'm shooting up everything
I just bought my woman some Vera Wang
I just bought myself Alexander Wang
I just bought myself some new Louis frames
I got 'em prescribed cause I'm blind as fuck
Or is it that I just don't wanna see you again?
Got 'em prescribed
I got a prescription

I fuck a clit up on everything
Tie my bitch up to the bed frame
22.5 for the Venus
11 flat for the Serena
Drink codeine like it's Aquafina

Fresh out the womb I knew I was a leader
Who keeping score 'cause I beat 'em

And I got some really big wings
Flying over New Orleans
I pull some really big strings
My wingspan like Yao Ming
My eyes tight like Yao Ming
I smoke some really big greens
I sip the whole sixteen

And still got really big dreams
Your bitch a really big fiend
Your bitch a really big fan
But I ain't got no ceilings
I ain't got no ceilings
I ain't got no ceilings
I ain't got no ceilings

Man, what a high
Born to be alive
I'm sippin' lean
And TMZ said I died

I run with bitch-slappers
Your hate don't impact us
Our bitches' dick-grabbers
Your bitches' pic-snappers
You just a camera rapper
But we don't point cameras at you
We point them hammers at you
More bullets than hammer dancers
We take the pineapple
And we fill it with purple, we never settle
We take the Mac-11
We point that bitch straight at your cerebellum
Bah!
Yeah, and this world is mines
Yeah, I'm gettin' mines
Yeah, I'm sippin' lines
Sippin', oh we talkin' lean?
Oh, we talkin' lean?!
Oh, you pourin' up?

Look at the smile on me
Spent a couple hundred thou' on it
And the game been drove me crazy
Over hundred thousand miles on me
Damn, said she gonna lie for me
I said you just lied to me
She tell me that's my pussy
I say bitch you just lied to me
That's why I fuck 'em all
Still love 'em all
With a rubber off
Cause they husbands' dogs
And to top it off
All the tops is off
And it's winter season
But the seats is heated

And I got some really big wings
I got a really big regime
Been part of some really big schemes
I just popped a really big bean
I just popped a really big bean
I rock some really big bling
I sleep on a really big king
With a really thick queen
I sleep with a really thick queen
On a really big king
She belt out really big screams
She say I got a really big ting
She say I'm doing really big things
I should be doing really big scenes
On a really big screen
You see, I got really big dreams
And what a grind...
I fuck a clit up on everything
I put some sip up in everything

She said she jog everyday so she can cum on herself

And she sucked my dick like it’s about to melt
She drink Vitamin Water, say it’s good for her health
She can wrap my whole dick around her waist like a belt
Then there’s another bitch, her name was Ayesha
She ride that dick good and make a mean cheese pizza
One time it was so good, I told her to order one mo'
She said it’s not Domino's -- its DiGiorno's
There’s another bitch I met her at the Gong Show
Got her to the crib and turned it straight into a thong show
She do my dishes, wash my clothes and fix my corn rows
She do my dishes, wash my clothes and fix my corn rows
I can't forget about my bitch named Meaty-boo
She’s a young project bitch, I used to bring that hoe to school school
So I brung her to the school  we standing on the yard
The bitch asked me if I was from the 17th ward

Niggas know my rhetoric; bitches know my preference
Young God, baby: all them other niggas reverends
Sittin' in my big house surrounded by my weaponries
I keep them away like I got leprosy
Chopper right next to me, loaded up with pepper seeds
Got an extra clip, but that's only for my especiallies, yeah
(Dramatic, Dramatic) This is especially for you
Just respect a nigga game, what kinda referee is you?
Swallow your whistle, make a nigga ride with the pistol
Cause the fakest niggas ride with the pistol
Even if I die old, I'mma die with the pistol
And if you stand over my body, I'll probably kill ya, yeah
Now I feel it, Weezy the realest
I wear a lot of Bathing Ape 'cause I be with gorillas, yeah
He what they talkin' bout: topic of the conversation
Product of determination, yeah
Stop playin, you are not up in my situation
I get money like a Caucasian
The car red, so the car Cajun, stop hatin'

Sitting back strapped, cocked
Plotting on your man next
Jack a nigga for his work
Then stretch it like some Spandex
He hesitate, I spray and leave him
Like a Tampex - oops, I meant a Tampax
Bitch, I keep that anthrax
I can get your man wacked for a couple tan packs
Shoot off your Sedan Lac
Nigga, I demand stacks
I ain't playing black
Bitch, I be spraying Macks
All type of guns with accessories
I'm like Cosby for the bills
I need mills like Stephanie
Pussy niggas can't stand next to me
I've got dope and ecstasy
Keep em floating like both of the levees breached
Eighties baby but my soul from the seventies
Worldwide game like a traveled the seven seas
Niggas ain't OG, scary lil bitch, please
Put your pussy in the pan, Friskies

I got ten up on my pinky ring and twenty on my bracelet
Now these niggas kissing ass, but they can't say shit
I'm just here to separate
The real from the fake shit
I told you, I was coming in
I'm sorry for the wait
I gotta get this money man
It's right here in my face
I got the Devil on my back
I don't wanna be up in that place
My grandmom tell me to be safe
I just keep running in these streets
I can't stop fucking with these hoes
When I say I'm just doing me
Bitch, I'm a Ninth Ward nigga
Mason street, D & G
That Florida right by the D
Need to free my nigga B
I ain't the type of person to be
Running from no beef, those fucking guns
Are gonna be bursting, knock somebody
Off their feet
So watch your fucking mouth
Before you end up on that floor and stop
Acting like you're hard cause
You know you've been a ho
I told you out the gate I'm not the fake
I gotta say, please excuse
Almost forgot man, I'm Raw Dizzy by the way

Money over bitches, bitch I'm coming for the check
Vampire living, bitch I'm coming for your neck
Raw, I'm sharp, my swagger like an X
I'm a motherfucking monster, I rap like I'm possessed
Call me Mr. Still Smoking, smoke it in a paper
The game is a bitch, hold that down and rape her
Yes I am a Blood but I be riding with my skaters
We probably smoking flavors bumping Tyler the Creator
I'm an Eastside native, all my niggas Soo Woop'n
They went brazy when they heard I had a song with Lil Tunechi
Bitch, get some ice and pour my Sprite
And light my bong and my doobies
Fuck your producer, I'm the one who be
Producing my music
I'm a hippie surrounded by a lot of pot
Cock the semi
Drop you like an Otterbox
They sleeping on me like I'm rapping with a blanket
Kill a nigga, have him thinking that he planking

All-red plaid shirt, skinny ass jeans on
Them goons at your front door, choppers out: ""ding dong
Didn't I change the game and put my motherfucking team on
Now let my chopper ring, blaka is my ringtone
Fuck you ho-ass niggas, I get money and get over hoes
We hold court with them heaters, pop case open/closed
Looking for a bitch to hop up on my totem pole
And my blunt be stupid-fat, double-stuffed Oreos
I get loaded til I motherfucking overload
Been rapping, flows still tight like aerobic's clothes
Ask them bitches, I told em hoes
They back it up like Sonny drive in Bronx Tale, Calogero
Lighter in my pocket, light the sky rocket
Pull them hammers out and run them nigga's like stockings

Umm to help these multiple generations that look at me as the reason they started rapping or the reason why they rap and into music is ... uh ... it's unexplainable. There isn't a word for it. You can't describe the feeling. Um if there, you know what I mean, there's words that's probably close to it, and when I say close I mean light years away from it, words like amazing, awesome, that's probably the closest, and like I said, that's light years away from the feeling, you know what I mean. I can't explain it, it's crazy just to turn on the television, just to see my own children walk inside and be like, you know what I mean, singing something you know like what is you talking about right now, what are you singing, what are you listening to on that iPad, what are you watching? And they be like ""such and such"" and I be like, you know, what is that, and they be like, you know what I mean, ""he loves you Daddy, he loves you Daddy, he always shouting you out Daddy, he always..."" and that's when they put me on, you know what I mean.

Cause she bad, so maybe she won't but shit, then again, maybe she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will
Maybe for the money and the power and fame right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will

I tell her ""go on! Pop that pussy for me""
Haters can't see me but bitches still looking for me
And you could take it to the bank and deposit that
Put your two cents in and get a dollar back
Some people hang you out to dry like a towel rack
I'm all about ""I"" give the rest of the vowels back
I like my girl thick, not just kinda fine
Eat her til she cry, call that ""wine and dine""
Try to check me and I'mma have em checkin pulses
They say ""choose wisely"" that's why I was chosen
Rocking like the asphalt, it's the cash's fault
Looked in the face of death and took it's mask off
Now I like my house big and my grass soft
I like my girl's face South and her ass North
But I'm Ray Charles to that bullshit
Now hop up on that dick and do a full split!

She just started to pop it for a nigga and looked back, told me baby it's real
And I say I ain't doubt you for a second, I squeeze it, I could tell how it feel
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here, baby you know the deal
Cause she bad, so maybe she won't but shit, then again, maybe she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will
Maybe for the money and the power and fame right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will

Pandemonium, she cause that
Toss it up, and I stuff 'em where her draws at
That's on everything like feets that's on my floor mats
Red bottoms, spikes on 'em, that's dos stacks
Speakin' Spanish while she tannin', body no fat
Shawty body body got me on my 4th stack
Pink champagne, order Moët
Rollin' airplanes, where I land at?
I levitate over numbers you niggas never make
The Columbians callin', I tell 'em ""perate""
Every summer I celebrate with a new estate
Let's get the fuck out this club, call it the great escape
She wrap her lips 'round a nigga, just like a chinchilla
Crap table Bellagio, I'm a big tipper
My life a stage I need her just to stand on it
Every time she look back, I toss a band on it

She just started to pop it for a nigga and looked back, told me baby it's real
And I say I ain't doubt you for a second, I squeeze it, I could tell how it feel
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here, baby you know the deal
Cause she bad, so maybe she won't but shit, then again, maybe she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will
Maybe for the money and the power and fame right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will",https://genius.com/Lil-wayne-she-will-original-lyrics
Grown Man,Tha Carter II,2005.0,"What's up baby?
I ain't trying to do nothing but get my grown man on
I ain't trying to hurt you
Only if you want me to
Yeah, something like that

Yeah, what's happenin' baby I'm Lil Wayne from New Orleans
Fresh out the navy, now the captain of my own team
Hop in this machine, vanish from the scene
Goddamn it I'm so mannish
Handle it like a standard
So put yo panties and yo pants my the trash can
Romance on the floor plans, yeah
We hold hands while we rolling, just trying to keep up with the program
Just trying to sneak up on ya, like how you doing ma'am
I'm a old soul, and a young man, we got to it and
We didn't stop 'til the birds hit the block
And she ain't never had it like that

Girl, you are so fine
I wish that I could get you over here, girl
Tonight, so I can get my grown man on with you
You don't know about it, I'm on my grown man

Now I don't really hit the club but tonight I'll make an exception
For some reason I can't seem to keep my eyes out your direction
I'm lookin' at you so hard, I could probably catch a charge
Feelin' the way you walk when you move yo booty applaud
I gotta keep my composure
I gotta attack my mission and handle business like a soldier
Young man, Young Money but the money long
Curren$y, The Hot Spitta so grown
And your perception of me is so wrong
Don't worry about what you heard about me and them other birds
Might have done a little dirt and left a few of them hurt
But whatever has occurred they all got what they deserved
And you don't rock like that, I can see it in your eyes
If you ain't good for me then you wearing a disguise
Cause tonight you looking like Miss Right
And I swore to be a player for life, but I'll change for you

Girl, you are so fine
I wish that I could get you over here, girl
Tonight, so I can get my grown man on with you
You don't know about it, I'm on my grown man

Baby girl, living in a ladies' world
And I'm a grown man, the women understand
See what I go through, is what I owe you
So you should throw that ass back to me right now
Fly boy baby sit back, relax and
Cruise with a nigga, destination satisfaction
Whose is it baby? She say, ""Weezy Fuckin' Baby""
I say, ""Yes in-fuckin'-deed,"" she say, ""Don't you ever leave""
I say, I say, ""But I got money on my mind""
Then I tell her never mind and we do it one more time 
For a large amount of time, long and won't stop 'til daytime come home

Girl, you are so fine
I wish that I could get you over here, girl
Tonight, so I can get my grown man on with you
You don't know about it, I'm on my grown man

Damn, look, that
Oh, that right there?
That's the sunset girl
Get your visor, where those Chanel shades I get you, you always losing things
And I'm always buying new things, I come a long way huh, remember?
Remember that block, look at you, you think you all grown

You ain't no woman you a baby girl, living in the ladies world
And I'm a grown man, the women understand
See what I go through, is what I owe you
And you should throw that ass back to me right now",https://genius.com/Lil-wayne-grown-man-lyrics
Back to Sleep,Dedication 6: Reloaded,2018.0,"Beep beep, beep beep, beep beeeeep

They can't touch you Tunechi, Poison Ivy, man
I roll up, I'm smoking like some hot tea, yeah
I woke up and couldn't believe I got sleep, damn
You woke up and then you try to live the dream
But before you check yourself, check my history
I ain't never been a stormchaser, or just a fly on the wallpaper
I ain't never been a tailgater, always been a bail-maker
If it heaven sent right now, she gon' give a nigga hell later
If you don't get the shit right now
You gon' love to hate the smell later
I tell her hold up, your pictures don't entice me
She told me pull up, and then she heard a light screech, yeah
I woke up with a white bitch under white sheets
She got a black heart, telling white lies through her white teeth
Black eyes from always tryna fight sleep
Ran into your wifey, she say, ""Tunechi, wife me""
Hello, I'm so spicy, I got her sweating like Keith
Though our time brief, she be on me like briefs
Ethika, Ethika, Ethika
Heffanie calling me Hefner
F-ing her all in her exiter
If he textin', I'm killing the messenger
All hail the death in America
Your ex be hatin' like eczema
That nigga fake as a wrestler
I poke him straight in his retina (Pssh)
Anyway baby, I'm feeling ya
Feel like I slipped and I fell in ya
But that nigga slipped and he fell for ya

I can get you your own area
Helluva, helluva, helluva
Girl the way you be taking this D from me
You act like you spelling something
Man this D put a spell on her
I'm deadly as my cellular
My diamonds sing like Mahalia
You gotta make a name for yourself
But these niggas fake as an alias
I don't see no comparison, no barbarians
I am not a human being, and you a humanitarian
I ain't trying to get booked again
Don't fuck with no librarians
Fell asleep in her wet pussy
I woke up in that aquarium, hold up

Woke up to niggas lookin' like me, damn
Throw up and go my ass right back to sleep, ugh

My friendship with Mack Maine is far, far, far, far, far, far more than a friendship. That's my fuckin' brother. I've known Mack since the hood, Hollygrove. He had the biggest house in the hood, it was right on the corner. I'm not sure if the whole house was theirs but it was huge, and he had a big ol' basketball court on his backyard and everybody used to play ba-, ball in his backyard. And umm, since he lived on the corner, like, you can always go and chill and play basketball on his backyard and then, like, always be right there on the corner in case some shit pop off. So yeah, me and Mack been down since the hood. He went to a good school, I didn't go to a too good school but then we ended up goin' to the same school, the school is actually called Mack Maine, know what I mean, and then, umm, he got known for fuckin' over niggas freestylin'. You know I mean, you know, Mack is cold at ribbin', I don't know if y'all call that roastin' or what all that shit y'all call it, but uh, he cold at that, period.

Haha! Cut the music up, please
Oh no, no; oh, no, no; oh, no, no
Hahaha
Geah!

I play the bullshit from the backseat, champ
Yeah, I'm in the backseat, still got the seat back
Feet back, stay from where the fake be at
Niggas snitch for the shine, where the patience at?
Nigga make his own brother face his back
Give love and take it back
Good grief! Man, this world is quite heavy on my aching back
Cops killing for crack; you know the story—snakes eat rats
Face the facts: you can't change him
Can't shoot it if you can't aim it
Can't miss him; if he kill you, then you can't blame him
That's just how the dice roll when you can't fade him
Get too deep up in that water, and they can't save you
Me, I come out of that water like I was just bathing
And watch my step on the wet pavement, yeah
I'm from the hood so I rep 'em where I can't take em
""Hollygrove, Hollygrove"" was his last statement
So nigga, get that look off your face
And recognize you got a crook in the place
They call me W-E-E-crooked letter-Y, I'm so high
I skeet-skeet in any nigga dime like she's mine
Streetsweeper in the back of the hatch, make me pop the latch
Leave you bloody with the cops to match
Bullet holes in your speakers from the chopper blast
Like... Hahaha!
That's bullet holes in your sneaker,s got you hopping back
It all stop when they hit you in your top and back
No cocking back, silly motherfucker, you ain't heard 'bout this
The clips hang down to the dick
That's a automatic shotty from a drum they call Tommy
Guaranteed to get you bitches from by me
When I hit every piece of your visible body, he leaking!
Mortimer is no longer leaping—he's sleeping
While you pussy niggas is sleeping, I'm thinking
Deep in thought, the boy ain't even winking
Bob Marley got me stinking
Stacking figures, I'm standing firm; life's a Slinky
Pipes is filled with crack cocaine
And the dope go inside of the veins
From where I came, though I bear a name only one can live with
Coach, they won't knock me off my pivot, forget it
I'm sicker with it; pick a city, buy a condo
Find a fine ho, let some time go—chill
What you know about a bongo having her mind go
Over a convo about dough? Nothing!
Man, the four-wheelers look so good on the sand
Tee or tank top, pocket fan
No pocketknife, no handgun in sight
Just that rat-tat, tat-tat-tat, t-tat-tat, BOOM!
Haha! Tonight, I might...
Just boost my feature price
'Cause to each his own, and the lights is bright
And I'm feeling like Mike at a Tyson fight
I'm from Cita house, big momma's house
She told me to shoot you right after I knock you out
And he ain't getting up after them shots
If you hit him in the right spot
Hold up... the beat might drop

Young veteran, soon to be OG
Plus I spit like a crackhead with no teeth
I hear you little niggas barking, want more beef
You like a nigga with no guns, you gets no peace
And when it comes to money my shit is obese
Like Della Reese, I need celery
More money, what the fuck these niggas telling me?
I'm young Lucifer, take em all to hell with me, yeah
Drop 'em off in a fire storm, YM riot squad, get our riot on
If he testify like Common, see the fire bomb
If you know what's best, mothafucka, get your quiet on
These niggas starving out here getting they diet on
While I'm eating, nigga, gripping on my styrofoam
One man game, nigga, I'ma die alone
For now, I'm with your girl, getting my Rowdy Roddy Piper on

Willie the Kid, pull guns like a hamstring
No bull, I push Pro-Vs like Pantene
Blow like a trombone, funny niggas, tambourine
Players get jumped like a trampoline, tangerine
Gators day, nay-sayers, mascara wearers
And my niggas on paper, getting paper like ballplayers
No blood no foul, yeah, my heart cold as Moscow
We nap ya kin like a hot towel (Gangsta!)
All my hoes hostile, not me, never tell me ""not now""
Rap niggas, forty-cal. to your brow (Ugh, ugh)
Roof-remover, we leave your brain with more air
Maneuver, I leave your bitch with a moist chair (Gangsta Gri-zillz!)
Seduce her, yeah, you rappers should be tired of lyin'
But I know it's hard like a tire iron
But yet it's complex, like it's Mayan science
Or Aztec math, I'm crazy as a mesc' tab
I feed niggas like a mess hall
And yes, y'all, It's Willie, how I address y'all
Or like a stylist, nobody's fly as this
You crazy? I'm getting brain like a psychiatrist

And I'ma keep fucking this world

They say powder makes you hyper, reefer makes you calm
Cigarettes give you cancer, woo-woos make you dull
While I sip the purple harlot, thick as my Southern drawl
Put me on the ocean floor wit a mermaid wit no draws
They got bats up in the cave, upside-down
Blood rushing to they head, they reacting off sound
As I stand on the mound, pitching for the crown
Uptown-bound, face painted like a clown
Reciting scriptures from the chapters, Proverbs, Leviticus
Old-ass rappers complaining what the business is
'Bout the state of hip, soundin like some bitches
Hop your ass up off a rich nigga dick, it's ridiculous
The new school nigga, what you need to do is become a resident
Under conditions, get your ass up off your ass
And get your ass up on a mission, become some competition
Like Federer and Nadal, Young Money, nigga, we ball
Like Kobe or Chris Paul, forgiving a wack cracker
Still sipping Cristal, waving the lifeline
Since life's a bitch, y'all, raising up the skirts of Jezebels
For no cash, like, ""Bitch, gimme that ass""
Or pulling up to the lot like, ""Gimme that Jag'""
No, pulling up to the lot like, ""Gimme that Lam'""
They study me, yeah, they cram, like I'm a final exam
If I hit you in your back, tou'll need a spinal exam
I'm something like a rhino or ram, animal, beast
Irritating you pussies like chlamydia, yeast
YM militia, you niggas better retreat
Or be like this beat, R.I.P., deceased

'Cause I'ma kill 'em, I'ma kill 'em
Yeah, I'ma kill 'em, yes, I'm kill 'em
And I'ma kill 'em, I'ma kill 'em
I'ma kill 'em (Gangsta Gri-zillz!)

Yeah, already, you better call every pallbear-ier in y'all area
The ball carrier gon' get popped, if I'm coming around the block The in-swing drive gets stopped, he gon' drop like a flop
On the court, I love sports, that's why I play my bitches
'Cause I got game, that's why you pay my bitches, yeah
Same hustle, new money
I'm just hip-hopping like two bunnies (Gangsta!)
Who run it? Bitch nigga, moi
That was French, nigga, not a kiss, nigga, nah
Ha, no homo, rappers get ate like four and four
They say I fucked so-and-so
And I be like ""So, so and so""
Nikes on they neck, they like, ""Let me breathe""
I'm sorry, but I can't, this is how we feed (Gangsta Gri-zillz!)
This is why we hot, this is how we freeze
Too fast to follow, this is why we lead
And the money in the pocket isn't why we Gs, see
This is how we shoot and this is how we leave (Gangsta!)
You know we tote steel, this is how we ease
You can get the steel if you try these thieves, now
Pass me the Swisher, let me climb these trees
And them haters say we couldn't, this is why we bes
This shit like pudding, putting it down
Like gravity's pulling, putting it down
Like gravity's pulling, putting it down
Like gravity's pulling me to the ground (Gangsta Gri-zillz!)

Told him I don’t think that I can please ya
But I got a bunch of killas wanna meet ya

All of my niggas is real, all of my niggas is solid
All of my money is in rubber bands, I do not carry a wallet
All of my bitches stay ready, soon as I walk in she gon pop it
Everyday I be floating, forever on autopilot
If that nigga ain’t got my money though
Wrap him up like a mummy though
Regular wolves howl at the moon
My wolves come out when it’s sunny though
My niggas ain’t got no words with police
You tell the cops what they wanna know
This shit right here is my dummy flow
No Ibaka but I bring that thunder though
Your girl a jumpoff, I holler ""Geronimo""
Slam in that pussy like dominos
That boy Millz he got beats and all kinds of flows
What you think Weezy signed me for?
Stayed down and I’m still down
True definition of loyal

From birth to now, heart Big like L, Notorious, and Pun
I want what I deserve, and some

The flow is like meth, it’s like crack, it’s like heroin
Yes I am spitting this dope
I am the future, I’m seeing right through you
I’m so New Orleans but I do not know voodoo
My piece will come face-to-face with you like Oovoo
Have niggas searching for you like it’s Google, I’m brutal
I’ve been slept on for a long time
Been patient for a minute, now I want mine
I hear a lot of niggas talking down
I’ma put my mothafuckin foot where the sun don’t shine
Can’t rhyme in a cypher like this
I’ve been rockin with the best
They don’t put me on the list
I’m an underground king
Underrated in the streets favorite
Every street corner gonna speak bout this
Rest in peace Pimp C
Still got the muddy cup full of Morgan Freeman
Yep, lean on me
Like Wu Tang, cash rules everything around me
You know I got the cream on me
Gun barrel smoking like hydro
Middle fingers up, fuck five-o
Still repping B's like a H-town nigga
When I’m finished in this bitch call Geico
You looking at a god man, I put that on the Bible
Killin’ everything fuck rivals
Hundred round drum on the stick
When I let the bitch off man it sound like pyro

Oh it’s way past midnight
Shadows in them streetlights
Gotta trap for them niggas tryna act like
A bitch ain’t got a whole team right
Yeah ahh
He think that he gone take it from me
He said I should give it up cause he got money
Told him I don’t think that I can please ya
But I got a bunch of killas wanna meet ya",https://genius.com/Lil-wayne-duck-lyrics

Shout out to the Vice Lords, and to Disciples
That's that gang talk, you need subtitles
We sendin' Scud missiles
Your bitch in love with us
We simply mud sippers
More cane than a cripple
Look I am nobody, 'cause nobody's perfect
Abracadabra, I make a ho out a virgin
I treat her like a servant
Thanks for your service
I'm cold like sherbet
Got it sewed up like a surgeon
It's me and Mannie Fresh back together, bitch we mergin'
The jokes on them and we smirkin'

Got too many bitches flirtin'

I’m A Beast,The Drought is Over 2: The Carter 3 Sessions,2007.0,"Rapping is my hobby, my house has a lobby
My bitches act snobby, because I feed them thousands
I know that didn't rhyme but I'm only being honest
You can't pay me in cash now I'm only seeing commas
I swear I got on Saks 5th boxers right now
I'm trynna milk the game as if the game was a cow
I had an Eddie Bauer Expedition seven years ago
My grandma used to tell me that she swear I been here before
I used to wear braids like Jason's Lyric, whoa
Spent a bundle on the cross because I'm spiritual
And I can never pass a physical, I stay high
High as the voice of Akon
And make mine a straight with no chase
Hold the ice, I got enough on anyway
And when they see the boy, they hyperventilate
I got 'em running after me like I'm about to win a race

Cause I'm a beast, I'm a dog
Bitch I'm a beast, ho I'm a dog
Yeah you know that I'm a beast, I'm a dog
I'm a beast, ho I'm a dog
You know that

No, never entertain the suckers with the hating bidness (Nah he never did that)
I'm on a yacht playing table tennis
Expensive linin, women sinning
Adultery - compulsively
I'm an arsonist on the beat, blaze fire
The door close to the booth, I feel like a caged lion
Yeah let me loose, now let me get 'em
Cause I ain't going back and fourth like badminton
No I will never drop the ball like bad mitten
And I ain't being conceited, I'm just admitting
I flow cocky, got hand rhythm
I got this bitch on lock like San Quentin
I'm tough daddy, what's popping gangster?
I'm trynna keep my pockets fat like opera singers
So sharp, if you touch me I'll chop your fingers
I'm on top of the game like helicopter angles
I see you niggas, I hope you having fun
I hope you have a gun, this shit is crazy
It's little Baby, I'm here to take it
And it's looking vacant


Ok, now I'mma go off on 'em, at first I was going soft on 'em
But now it's time to go hard, busting, banging Bogard
Take a shit in yo' yard, take a piss on yo' broad
Make a list of yo' boys, and go and murder them all, huh
Life is short, yeah a midget told me that
And I always thought I was fly like I had a pigeon on my back
But I got decisions on my back, vision on my back
So don't you try to run up on me, I got precision with that gat
I don't rat-tat-tat-tat-tat, all I got to do is tat
Bet I hit my tar-get, like a fucking dart mat
My address is Cloud 9, seek and you shall find
Weezy on da grind, 
I'm bout my Frankenstein
You know me, yeah, from my Lincolns to my Franklins
See I make that money stretch and connect like an anklet
Keep the bitches running in and out my house like a banquet
And I don't even speak their language, haha
And if the bitch boyfriend get angry
Then my niggas turn around and tell his whole click

From a Cadillac window, baby
Hoping this girl in my passenger don't act funny with me
Get her to my home, we get naked like some new born babies
I'm ready to perform and she's gon' be my audience
And she said ""Bravo""
And I said ""I know""
And she said ""Encore""
Girl, I'm really big on you
So what you wanna do?
Too fly you need a parachute
But that just means you're falling in love

In love with a skater
Five six seven, man, I already ate her
She had a coffee mug and a pair of Uggs
Got some makeup on my shirt when she gave me a hug
Shorty got me open
Pussy so good wish I could smoke it
Where your mans at?
Remember me like this one time at band camp, yeah!
Like that man, 
she on my mind all day, check my CAT scan
Hey, where you going with all that?
I fuck her till she whine and then I drink a tall glass


Girl you gon' make me take you
To your desired destination
Left leg, right leg, segregation
Cause I know you like that shit, cause I love that shit
Girl that's my hole, I dug that ditch
And when it gets cold, I'm there for her to hold
She climbs my pole, beat that pussy like she stole something
And she so fine
From the front from the side from behind
Pop that pussy like a cork and I'mma fuck you till you whine",https://genius.com/Lil-wayne-staring-at-the-world-lyrics

She would do anything she could to feel the flame
When everybody know your move and the things you pay
She finally made all her dreams come true and then she screamed

Oh no, this ain't paradise! Oh no, this ain't paradise!
Oh no, this ain't paradise! (Yeah)
Oh no, this ain't paradise! Oh no, this ain't paradise!
You know, this ain't paradise

He was a young boy in pursuit of money and fame
And he would do anything he could to kill the pain
When everybody know your moves, they speak of your name
And oh, all over the late night local news I heard him scream

Oh no, this ain't paradise! Oh no, this ain't paradise!
Oh no, this ain't paradise! (Yeah)
Oh no, this ain't paradise! Oh no, this ain't paradise!
You know, this ain't paradise

Woah
I say the sun don't shine forever (Oh oh oh oh oh)
And everything that glitter ain't gold (Ahhh)
I say love don't love forever (Oh oh oh oh oh)
And everything that's new gets old (Rahhhhh)

Sometimes we try to find the road to the riches
Need roadside assistance
Blisters on my knees, from beggin' for forgiveness
Ain't no dollars on my trees, but mileage on my feet
'Cause I been climbin' to the peak, and runnin' from the bullshit
I'm tired of playin' the same song, who told the DJ bring it back?
Dead Presidents, bullet in Abraham Lincoln hat
Starin' at big poster, I swear that he be winkin' back
Cut school, sell crack, sorry I'm just thinkin' back
Call me crazy, I've been called worse
It's like I have it all, but what's it all worth?
Ha ha, I'm probably better in my afterlife
I should cherish life, but this just ain't paradise

Oh no, this ain't paradise! Oh no, this ain't paradise!
Oh no, this ain't paradise! (Oh, ohh ohh ohh)
This ain't paradise; no, this ain't paradise

Play with fire, you get burned
When the heat was on, I turned
Turned to trouble... trouble

Yeah, yeah, C3, yeah
New Orleans baby
A street called Eagle
And everybody's ill
Yeah, ill-egal
People steal cars
We steal people
We eat like dogs
But we still people
And even when ya lost
Trouble still see you
And even if ya dead broke
We are still equal
One time for the lil people
Eat ya meal, don't let ya meal eat you
(I run with trouble...)
StreetRunner we crazy with this one
I, run, with, trouble

And just the other day my nigga Chris killed his self
I pray to God that I never feel the way he felt
Where do we go when there's no help?
He figured heaven, so he went left
Y'all know that ain't right
Plus he was high as a plane on that same night
Shit I probably been on that same flight
Shit I probably had that same fight
I just kept swinging
Twelve rounds coming, bells ringing
(I run with trouble...)
Introduced to the game when I was just a child
Mama loved a drug dealer, straight quit her job
They took his life
And along with him I died
And she died
We died
Then came my daughter to my bedside
Told me ""Daddy, don't cry, I'm alive""
I look her in the eyes
And see me with no sins
But this is how the note ends

(I have walked a bitter line
Chosen second over cheap wine)
Ya know
Just kick it back
(Still I look for brighter times)
I can't call it

Ya know? Heheh
Yeah, yeah

The tooly poke out the jeans
The coke smell just like a bunch of coffee beans
Ya na mean?
And everything ain't what it seem
Ya na mean?
And don't play that game without your team
Kill for my bread, kill for my cheese, kill for my cream
I will have that red beam on high beam
Now I hear sirens
Wait I think I see one behind me
I ain't trippin baby, money got me

And fuck the police, fuck the feds too
I ain't jumpin' in that jumpsuit
A one-two, I'm on my one-two
Check me out
I fuck around and check you
Respect due
Pay yours nigga
Mine's under the seat
By my feet
Where yours nigga?
Too much hoarse liquor huh
Too much pressure, too much force
Too much money
You never heard that before
Shit
And we stop the snitches at the door
Cut that tail off the rat
He won't rat no more

That's right
Get trapped fuckin' with my cheese
Keep shooting 'til I burn my sleeves

Represent New Orleans like a fleur-de-lis

I'm a pill poppin' animal, syrup sippin' nigga
I'm so high you could'nt reach me with a fuckin antenna
You're fuckin with his man, you could be his man dinner
The nine gimme brains but the ak add liver
Your rapper is the same flowin like a bad river
Make yo ass quiver like you naked at winter
Hollygrove honcho, hardtime giver
I'm a shark in the water you just long john silver
I got a girl you wanna meet her?
Her name is nine millimeter
Feed me rappers or feed me beats
Uptown New Orleans like always
Cash money boys shine like bald heads
Big bezzel make my watch look like a hog head
But all I do is smoke trees call me log head
I'm butter on the bread like parkay
And I am all about me like do re
I'm in the hood, in the hood like dope yay
Nappy ass hair like buckwheat otay
Hollygrove, Eagle street be my damn hood
Or you can get murdered for free like canned goods
I got 12 Barbaros under that Lam hood
I could bring Kentucky derby to the damn hood
Sunshine diamonds, call me tanned goods
And now I let it blow, like a bad wood
I call brisco, I'm on South Beach
Thirty minutes later Opa-lacka is where I be
Feed me rappers or feed me beats
Man I'm so Hollygrove
Stand strong in the water like a commadore
Black holes in your white tee, dominoes
Me n brisco cash money carnivores
Hehe, I am New Orleans like carnival
And in the hood call me Weezy the honorable
These other rappers so ironical
And if I ain't in the mansion then I'm up in the phantom oh
Yea, you know it, listen up man, dj cinema, cinematic
Whatever you wanna call him, I need you to spin this thang crazy
Spin this when I tell you not to, talkin about 8 in the mornin
To 8 in the mornin', ya feel me, yea, can fox holla at cha boy

Just Chill,Tha Carter V (2014 Version),2018.0," got a haircut
Mu in this bitch, Scoob in this bitch with me

So much shit on my mind, I just hope I don't smell like it
The motherfuckers pointing fingers
Be the same ones that have nail bitin'
Real niggas, still real niggas, you new niggas, just lil' niggas
When ya shit fall, don't be surprised
Acting like you didn't hear timber
I'm caffeinated, I'm half-sedated
I started from the bottom, I gravitated
I'm validated, I'm a trigger happy nigga
And it's sad to say it, but I had to say it
I had to do it, I had to stunt, act like I had what I had for once
With all of my thank yous added up
I still can't thank Birdman enough
, I woke up in a new Tyra Banks
I've been gettin' money since Shabba Ranks
The car I'm in brand spankin' new, it just got spanked
Real niggas say rest in peace to DJ Screw
Rest in peace to Pimp C too
Fuck your bulletproof vest (blat) I still need proof, my nigga
I hate you like mustard, I'm disgustin'
I'm aiming at your chest, hit your face, I'm just rusty
Cherish every step that we take, some of us clumsy
Lookin' for a breath of fresh air, it's hidin' from me, fuck
Mall roll it up in the leaf, weed stronger than Zangief
I last longer than an antique, her pussy cummin' like a stampede
She cooks, fucks and clean, the type of bitch that every man need
The type of bitch that every man leave
That ain't cool, and she wearin' sleeves, but chill, just chill

Girl, you gotta chill, uh, I just gotta tell you how I feel, yeah
Girl, you gotta chill, uh, you know that I'll always keep it real
You just need to chill, oh, oh
Girl, you gotta chill, girl, you gotta chill (gotta chill)
Girl, you gotta chill, girl, you gotta chill (gotta chill)
Yeah, girl, you gotta chill

You could fuck all these bitches, except my bitches
Yeah right, I wish, with all three wishes
Man I swear she got too attached, had to cut the umbilical
Man I swear I'm so armed, I feel like I got tentacles
Niggas bumpin' their gums, I feel like Orajel
Got 'em scratchin' their head, combin' out broken nails
See I give 'em my love, but I'm an indian giver
Got my ear to the streets, I hear the enemy whisper
I break the bank with a sledgehammer
Cellphone rings like Saturn
Bitch let a nigga breathe, breathe like a dragon
I hide money everywhere, that's my hidden talent
One time for them gangstas, fuck that, two times for them gangstas
If you got a problem, I'll fix that like, yeah nigga I'm maintenance
Got a bad bitch and she anxious, bitch, you just an acquaintance
I'll ask a rat, ""Why be a rat?"" then kill him while he explainin'
Tell your foot soldiers to walk light, handful of real niggas left
And if any nigga wanna step to me tell 'em hurry up and take bigger steps
My bitch deep, I get in depth, that's what the fuck I'm talkin' 'bout
She dyed her pussy hair red, she said she had to roll the red carpet out
That's real
So real

Yeah, you know that I'll always keep it real
You just need to chill, oh, oh
Girl, you gotta chill, girl, you gotta chill (gotta chill)
I just gotta tell you how I feel, yeah, girl you gotta chill
Girl, you gotta chill, girl, you gotta chill (gotta chill)
Girl, you gotta chill, girl, you gotta chill (gotta chill)

6 shit

I said I wasn't gon' love these hoes
I ate my words like a pussy hole
She suck my dick and my bullet hole
And got on my dick, did the tootsie roll
She know how much I love candy though
She know how much I hate pantyhose
I know how much she love animals
But she let me stomp on her camel toe, damn

Girl what the deal, though
Put up them dildos, fuck with a real one
Fuck 'til the sun come, we can still chill, though
Kick it like field goals, lick it like mail, though
Sleep by your mailbox, IG yo' G spot
I kill yo' pill spot, I give a cheerleader somethin' to cheer 'bout
I get you too high, I hear yo' ears pop
You hear my key chain, you hear the birds fly
All gold dust, pull the pills out
You take your clothes off, you tell me go hard
I tell you ""No duh""
And we both smoke so I rolled up
And we pulled up in my gold tub
And you woke up with soap suds all up in yo' chocha
Fuck it, shawty, it's yo' fuckin' birthday
Almost fuckin' drown me, little fuckin' mermaid
Damn, fuck it, shawty, everyday yo' b-day
And if you want this D, bae, everyday is D Day, boom
I'ma lay you on your spinal cord
And you gon' take all this dinosaur
Yeah, I'ma lay you on your spinal cord
And you gon' take me on your private tour
Hol' up, I'ma lay you on your pretty face
And 
hit it from the back like you hit the brakes
Got a pretty face and a pretty shape
Tryna be a star and I'ma give you space
Wait, 1, girl, let's start this shit, 2, girl, yo' heart just skipped
3, girl, and you will see, 4, how good this D can be
5, I love to do you right
And 6 ain't shit if it don't end with 9
Invite yo' friend that's friendly fire
Bitches ain't shit but yours and mine
Ooh, girl I love you so
That's why I always fuck you slow
All these little hoes they come and go
She was just a flame, went up in smoke
And I told myself not to love the bitches
Hard to stop fallin' for a bitch when you trippin'
Hard to stop sleepin' on a bitch when you sippin'
When you sippin'
Can't trust these hoes, can't love these bitches
Then my heart get cold, middle finger with the mittens
Bitches lie through they teeth, I never wanted to be a dentist
Might as well keep spittin', it ain't love it's business
Hoe, watch that hoe you sleep with, bitch ass hoes be creepin'
Watch that hoe she be wit', who she prolly sleep wit'
Damn, but you know that ain't cheatin, we should have a meetin'
Watch that hoe you eatin', food for thought, I'm thinkin'

I said I wasn't gon' love these hoes
I ate my words like a pussy hole
She suck my dick and my bullet hole
Got on my dick, did the tootsie roll
She know how much I love candy though
She know how much I hate pantyhose
I know how much she love animals
But she let me stomp on her camel toe, damn

And her clit got a hair trigger
Damn, and her clit got a hair trigger
And her clit got a hair trigger
But the bitch gotta spare a nigga, damn
Watch that hoe you sleep wit', bitch ass hoes be creepin'
Watch that hoe she be wit', oh, nah, they ain't speakin'
Damn, that's that silent treatment, I don't wanna know the reason
Watch that hoe you eatin', food for thought, I'm thinkin'

She walkin' around in a Young Money Tee without a bottom
She squad
It's a 
Secret society, these niggas tiny, I'll be your body
Screaming, Money Team, Money Team, Money Team, Mula
Screaming, Money Team, Money Team, Money Team
From the rooftops

Young Tune winnin' now
You know I been winnin' then and now anyhow
Anyway, don't start no shit if you can't finish loud
I've been away, I've been around
I've been busy doin' business
Mind your business 'fore I shut your fuckin' business down
She say my lyrics like a lifeline when she down
She checkin' bitches off my timeline when she down
But all them bitches on the sideline, out of bounds
Watchin' us play around

Stephanie and Weezy now
The birds birds birds are you singing now?
They gonna' keep a lil Puerto-rican out
A lil' souvenir gotta get me now
Haul ass on a bitch all in the fast lane
Turn Xan on your bitch you are just Plain Jane
I just laugh at the shit with my bad bitch gang (gang gang)
Cause' you ain't a bad bitch without a YM chain

I second that shit you ain't lyin' that's game
I tell your nigga meet me outside in the rain
I shoot him up like a hundred times then again
Again and again, are you not entertained?
Ain't no better drugs than the ones I know

I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
And right now I'm both, got me talking bout you hoe

Fuck your team, fuck your team, fuck your team, Like 2Pac
Sip slow, no blowin' highs, no killin' vibes
We touch each other, touch the skies, she rub her eyes
She cry 
Money Team, Money Team, Money Team,
 Mula
She cry Money Team, Money Team, Money Team
Then I zoom out

I said ""Tell me who you loyal to?""
Is it Weezy? Is it Wayne? Is it Tunechi? Is it gang?
Or these no-names hanging with a nigga with a name?
How you poppin' pain pills and you living with the pain?
You can't tell me that ain't horrible
And my love always free when the lights get dark
I know love isn't cheap I got a nice-ass job
You look priceless to me, I'll rip your price tag off
Baby ""Tell me who you loyal to?""
Do you start with the money or the man?
Does it end with your heart in your hand?
Fuck it, if the money bag in the other hand, that was the plan
Let that nigga spoil you
I guess somebody else on grind mode
But a nigga that provide though
Put his pride to the side though, and you my slime, so

See, this Dedication mixtape series is so important to the culture because they say it is. It's plain and simple, plain and simple. I don't label it important to the culture. If I have ever labelled it important to the culture I was feelin' myself and smellin' my drawers -- uh, pause -- I'm old, my mama used to always say that, my grandma used to say that ""You smellin' your drawers."" -- but anyway, I don't know if y'all people say that, I'm from the south -- but yeah, the Dedication mixtape series is important to the culture because the culture say it's important. So that's why I still jump my ass in these motherfuckin' booths, wherever I can find a booth, most likely the same one, and do my motherfuckin' thing. And I gotta keep doing my thing and that's why I do my thing because the culture say it's important. They say ""We want that, we need that, we gotta have that."" It make the-it make the world know what I mean? It make the music world spin, and that's what it's all about, and it's 'cause they say it",https://genius.com/Lil-wayne-weezy-n-madonna-lyrics

Cleaner than laundry mats, jumpin' in somethin' from
Other countries, companies, junkie, you cannot order that!
I flew that into the water back
Order, 
go to Iraq and get a car with gas and tell them crackas war with that
All I need is an automatic: tick, boom
I'm a goon, I go zoom; smell the fumes from the vrooms

I would never be another groom unless I assume
The bitch ain't givin' up the womb to him and whom

I pop early like firecrackers in the last week of June
I'm gettin' my lunch like noon, I gotta eat

Nobody knew my name, they only knew my face

Lord, protect me from my friends, I can take care of my enemies
I come from where the niggas just kill to save energy
Sorry, world, but my mommy drop me where the clinic be
So if you tried to mimic me you'd probly catch some sick disease
Six degrees, leanin' on that promethathathathazene

Fuck the head of the state, fuck the gates surroundin' the prisoners

Tough as Bamm-Bamm from Bedrock; I'm tied to the game like wedlock

Anybody you lost, put 'em on your heart
Because this rap is real, you know?
Light it up for 'em
I hope you ain't too tired to cry
And I hope you know
You ain't never too alive to die, heh

Listen, I grew up where the people call them people on us
Think we slangin', but we just got beepers on us
Grindin' all day like we got sleep insomnia
Living like the videos, write a treatment on us
Stuck in the hood like they poured cement on us
Ghetto bird still shittin' on us
Government still quittin' on us
Lost a few homies, and the grief's still sittin' on us
So we got their names written on us
White folks still spittin' on us
And them bitchass police K9's teeth still grittin' on us
But we smoke, ashes still gettin' on us
Older bitches still hittin' on us
I remember well, Beezy rolled a L
Beezy ain't here — Where's Beezy at? Beezy got killed
And that was my nigga, I go way back with my nigga
But I know that's how it happened, my nigga
Shit is much deeper than this rappin', my nigga
But now they all rappin', my niggas
So now I must make it happen
So I'mma play the captain, sailboat flappin', my nigga
No fingers, I'm snappin'
Happy for my nigga Lil Tagus
'Cause even though we couldn't, the Lord saved him
Last time we seen him was when Katrina hated
Shit, found his body like a month later
Rest in peace, boy
He was a East boy, and so was Wessy West
He was a good nigga, so I know he blessed
And his daughter is a princess
This shit is harder than a bench press
But I'mma keep goin'
And I swear I got a lump in my throat
But I'mma keep on pumpin' the flow
So if I cry, don't stop the beat
I feel like my heart just stopped a beat
My nigga Lil Derek was quick to cop a ki
Either that or load the gat and go pop a G
And because of that he's just a name in a rhyme of mine
I pray his family and his momma's fine
So much shit just sit on this mind of mine
I think about it all the time, I drink about it all the time
I smoke back to back
'Cause if my thoughts got to me, I'd be in this rap
Or I'd be in the can
Thank God I had dreams of being the man
Yeah, and fuck a man with a badge
'Cause he ain't shit to a man on the edge
The 5-0 killed Naudy, good boy dead
Man, you would've thought they killed cornbread
Shot him up, face down on the lawn
Not to mention, with his handcuffs on
Not to mention, they had plain-clothes on
And the complaint goes on
But nobody do nothing about it
The jail house and the morgue is too fuckin' crowded
And hate is at an all time high
Everybody gotta hate, it's like a fuckin' iPod
Shit, and they tried to burn my Phantom up
But I got my gun license, haha, I got my hammers up
I'm ready to shoot like a camera —
Stay still motherfucker
I'mma have to write my will this summer
'Cause if they don't kill me, I'mma kill this summer
Yeah, and you can put that on my late Father
Or my late Grandmother, Miss Mercedes Carter
Or my Grandfather, Larry Balsock
The old man hustled 'til his heart stopped
And all I know of my real Pops is that he had money
No bank account, that brown paper bag money
Yeah, he might hit me off with a little brag money
But the nigga still wouldn't be a dad for me
But look how I turned out, I hope he glad for me
But that's why when I see him I acts mad funny
'Cause he's a joke to me
Don't message, don't call, don't talk to me
It's just me and my mama, how it's supposed to be
And I make sure she paid like she wrote for me
And I know she gets all hope from me
And I don't ever wanna see her mope for me
Hopefully, but, truthfully
There is a day that's due for me
But we gon' pray that it's as far as the future sees

But I can't be with you
Tomorrow I'll be back up on the first flight
Right up out of town
Young mullah baby
She sayin', do you have the time
To listen to me whine
She askin', who's on the other line
You diss me everytime
I tell 'em, baby I'm a star
Shit, I'm above a star
And now, I done got so high
I did forgotten, who you are, are, are
Oh oh oeh oh oh eh eh, ah ah...
I'm in love with you
But I can't be with you
Tomorrow I'll be back up on the first flight
Right up out of town
Young Mullah baby
Hop up on my spaceship
Girl I gotta drop your ass off
Last night, yeah we were spaced girl
You love it, girl I gotta take off
Cause I'mma be here next week
So call your company and take off
Oh oh oeh oh oh eh...
Cause she say ""Wayne Wayne""
So she got me all impatient
Cry me a river, I can hear my conscious
While I say aloud
Boy you got a problem
And you ain't foolin' no one
But yourself
You're like a hot revolver, hot revolver
But you ain't killin' no one but yourself
And so she's gone to party town, on her own
And you go by yourself, so all alone
I told her I can be with her
But I can't be with her
As much as she like me to
She like me too much, that's the problem
Oh my god then, shorty be wildin'
And when I say I got to leave
You wouldn't believe all of the things
That she'll do and all of the things
That she'll say to make me stay
And I be like, daaaaaammmmnnnnnn
I been that boy for forever
I'll be back someday
But she wanna go with me to outer space
So we made love in the Milky Way and then I send her on her way
Boy you got a problem
And you ain't foolin' no one
But yourself
Your like a hot revolver
But you ain't killin' no one
But yourself
And so she's gone to party town
On her own
And you go by yourself
So all alone",https://genius.com/Lil-wayne-hot-revolver-lyrics
Used To,Sorry 4 the Wait 2,2015.0,"[Intro: RiFF RAFF & 
Drake
]
Boys, now listen, we got more motherfuckin' TV screens
On the outside the damn tour bus than on that motherfucker
Boys playin' PlayStation
We come through motherfuckin' hang gliding
Off motherfuckin' Versace skyscrapers
I don't get it, what more can you ask for?
Yeah—sound, sound, sound
Yeah, real 6 side shit
Sickos, ah man

Yeah, when you get to where I'm at
You gotta remind 'em where the fuck you at
Every time they talkin', it's behind your back
Gotta learn to line 'em up and then attack
They gon' say your name on them airwaves
They gon' hit you up right after like it's only rap
Jewels look like I found a motherfuckin' treasure map
And ain't told no one where the fuck it's at
Shout out to the G's from the ends
We don't love no girls from the ends
I'm gon hit 'em with the wham once again
I'ma always end up as a man in the end, dog
It's just apparent every year
Only see the truth when I'm staring in the mirror
Lookin' at myself like, there it is there
Yeah, like there it is there man, whoo!
I ain't tryna chance it, I be with the bands
Like a nigga went to Jackson State or Grambling
Young Nick Cannon with the snare drum, dancin'
Watch the way I handle it, uh
Bring it to the bedroom, you know that shit is candle lit
She know I'm the man with it, uh
With the bands like I must've went to Clark, went to Hampton
I ain't playin' with it

I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to (What you say?)
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to (What you say?)
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to (What you say?)
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to, man

When you get to where the fuck I'm at
You gotta remind 'em about where you been
About all of the money that done came and went
About the two cents I ain't never spent
When they say you're too famous to pack a gat
I gotta remind 'em about where I'm from
Not about where I'm going, about where I've gone
Stepping on a Swisher roach like a stepping stone
Goin' at a nigga throat like a herringbone
Boy, do I smell beef? Mmmm, pheromones
Got a fuckin' halo over my devil horns
Trap pumpin' all night like Chevron
Suck a nigga dick for a iPhone 6
Fuck my nigga Terry for a new Blackberry
You can get buried for a ounce of Katy Perry
I was only five, but still remember the drought in '87
Lord, tell 'em bitches I ain't got no times to play games with 'em
I ain't got no time
Tell her that I love her and I hate her in the same sentence
I'm fuckin' her mind
I got, mind control over Deebo
Parmesan my panino
Promethazine over pinot
And when my bloods start shootin' that's B-roll, bitch

I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to (What you say?)
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to, yeah (What you say?)
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to (What you say?)
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to, man
[Outro: Drake & Lil Wayne, 
RiFF RAFF
]
Yeah, they don't love you like they used to (What you say?)
In the city with the- windows down
Like I used to, yeah (What you say?)
Like I
Take some to getting used to (What you say?)
Man, they don't love you like they used to, man
And I'm so sorry
Let's just let bygones be bygones, okay?
Let's just go ahead and just let bygones be bygones
I pull up lookin' like a damn cyborg, weighin' 224
Oh man, these boys don't even understand
Listen when you see OVO Jodi pull up on the scene with Drake
For goodness sakes, well for goodness sakes
You see this mixtape you listenin' to? This an album
Yea, we could have, we could have sold it to you for 17.99
Or 29.99 with the shirt, buy it at the Target
These motherfuckers trippin' so hard I had to look down and double check cause I thought they had their shoes tied together—motherfuckers got they shoes tied together
What more could you ask for?
Boys harassing me with these questions
How about this? How about don't ask me no more motherfucking questions? We ain't doing no interview!",https://genius.com/Lil-wayne-used-to-lyrics

Lighters up, lets get 'em

Though, though I'm missin you (straight to the head man)
I'll find a way to get through
I know livin without ya is impossible (yea)
Gone... I know you gon live on (cry momma, ya momma)
Cuz you were my brotha and I love ya, and I miss ya

Stay strong, be tough, that's what the preacher tell ya
He never really felt ya, so he can't even help ya
Need a shoulder to lean on, somebody to cry to
It's like everything's gone, but I'm a survivor
Standing on stage in front of thousands
Don't amount to me not havin my father
That's real talk, I know a lot of y'all got 'em
But you need 'em way more when you gotta go without 'em
And I'm without 'em, but that's life y'all
Sometimes you gotta learn to swim with no lifeguard
I'm alright, God, shit, I'm still breathin
But losses hurt like bullets, I'm about to start bleedin
Throw me down some comfort, cause my heart need it
Tryin to cope wit my chances and meet 'em
There's a dark road ahead, but I'm tryin to take it easy
Rest in peace Lil Beezy, my nigga
 (Lil Wayne in the background)
Though, though I'm missin you
I'll find a way to get through
I know livin without ya is impossible
Gone... I know you gon live on
Cuz you were my brotha and I love ya, and I miss ya
I miss my dawg I can't believe that it's over
But I'm a soldier, so I gotta over, can't stay sober, I'm just tryin to get over

Smoke kush all day and pop painkillers
Fuck who don't understand it, this what the game did us
This what the streets showed us
This how the block made us
The same block where they layed 'em
I pray every time I cross the spot on the pavement, save me
Lord, will I be next for the taking? Take me
I know I'm livin like I know when I'm comin
But I'm just livin cause I know that it's comin
And the end is comin, but I ain't runnin
I ain't hidin and duckin
I'm in the middle of a war, I'm alive and love it
I'm just speakin from the heart of the dyin' public
We still beatin, we gon rise above it
Though it seem like they cheatin and we losin'
We survive if nothin
They could never take the stride from strugglin
I gotta ride,
 and sometimes that ride get bloody
But I just think about my buddy
And go after that money
But uhh..
 (Nikki and Lil Wayne)
Ohhh, we gotta get over, we gotta get over, gotta get over
It's almost over, and we gon be alright


Straight Patron out the bottle to the head now
We gettin read now, bitch my nigga dead now
And all the things I never said, I gotta say it now
I shoulda said it then, now I gotta talk to clouds
Now I gotta walk around
Brim down
Just tryin to find my way to the next day
Escape
Ya birthday could be ya death date
So I'm livin like it was just yesterday
Let's pray
Ten fingers together
Can't bring 'em together
It's murda-murda, I don't think it get better
So be a competitor or get out the weather
Me? I got a umbrella and a Berretta
I'm just tryin to make sure my daughter future progressin
And behind that, I'm shootin excessive
Trust me
The beautiful dead, we livin wit the ugly
I just tell my pops wait for me
I'm comin

Russian Roulette,Funeral (Deluxe),2020.0,"Yeah, mula, uh

I pray so hard for my enemies
I wish them well with no other intent (Amen)
Life is not promised, no guarantee
No guarantee, but you get what you get
It's like Russian roulette (Yeah)
It's like Russian roulette (Baow)
It's like Russian roulette (Yeah, baow)
No guarantees, but you get what you get

Yeah nigga, pistol to your ear nigga
Have my big homie kill your lil' nigga
We heard the bricks comin' on the boat
We at the dock, we at the pier nigga
You won't even spot or hear niggas
But when they get here nigga
We gon' pop up and appear nigga
On some DMX shit, we gon' be like, ""We right here, nigga""
Even though we right here, we far away, we light years, nigga
And my AK got diarrhea nigga
I'm promethazine, mixed with gasoline, mixed with antifreeze
And you just some light beer nigga
Sig Sauer spit a wig for ya
Sip oil better than an oil rig, dig?
All your bust downs sparklin' like foil
And the coke got me sweatin', keep a towel on my shoulder
Like I used to coach the Georgetown Hoyas
I would walk down and draw down on you
Tell your woadies pray for you
And your shooters better be some fuckin' Golden State Warriors
I'm gettin' older, other day I told my soldiers
Spare nothin' except the strollers, but my heart used to be colder
Never sober so a nigga prolly higher when he sober
I be higher than the solar system
Get rich and control the system
I was servin' it, like Anna Kournikova
From a Nissan Pathfinder, now I have to find a chauffer
I got alphabet bitches, I do numbers, I do digits
I hear gunshots at my door, hold on, who is it?

I pray so hard for my enemies
I wish them well with no other intent
Life is not promised, no guarantee
No guarantee, but you get what you get
It's like Russian roulette
It's like Russian roulette
It's like Russian roulette (Hold on, right)
No guarantees, but you get what you get (Uh, look)

You niggas do anything for fame and clout
What would you do for your freedom? Might give a statement out
I'm from a city, nobody think they'd make it out
Got a key and a Glock, I took the paper route
Gave my people the block, straightened out
And I'll be back by mornin'
Whip the bricks until your back side's soarin'
I just bust the AP, that's a fact, mind's water for my bracelet
Dropped twenty like Jordan on a bad night, scorin'
'Gnac pourin', I just pulled up in a matte white foreign
Stick got a drum in the beam and the flashlight on it, yikes
Yeah, my shit's bad like Lauryn, I ran a tour
On my last night tourin', I'm a Mack, like, hol' up

I pray so hard for my enemies
I wish them well with no other intent
Life is not promised, no guarantee
No guarantee, but you get what you get
It's like Russian roulette
It's like Russian roulette
It's like Russian roulette (Butcher comin', nigga)
No guarantees, but you get what you get

Bust it down 'til the scale break, did a buck thirty on the beltway
Caught a bomb, Travis Kelce, 'fore we touch down, it's a tailgate
Piece lookin' like a milkshake, had to back up, give myself space
Fake statements and my health straight, I can't give a fuck what no one else say
So deep it's like a jailbreak when the coupe slide down MLK
That's a bulletproof CLK, fire lands on the shelf case
Turned felons into executives, made a half a mil' and it felt great
Y'all niggas just a lil' late, got a big house on a lil' lake
And we both know how the smoke go, shots peel straight through a steel plate
Never throw stones when you know you livin' in a glass house like you Bill Gates
Good on both coasts like I'm LJ, Bape store out in LA
Bougie nigga even when I'm dead 'cause I'ma die and get to hell late, ugh

I pray so hard for my enemies
I wish them well with no other intent
Life is not promised, no guarantee
No guarantees, but you get what you get",https://genius.com/Lil-wayne-russian-roulette-lyrics

And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever mayne

Shit, nigga, this what I does

This is my tub and I'm dirtier than the summer, bitch
Weezy F. Baby, always lookin' like I done some shit
You ain't on nothin' bitch, better know who you fuckin' with
Try to fuck me, I'll kill you and who you comin' with
No homo, T, I had to go stupid
I'm on them high heels and I am no Bootsy
Collins Avenue, ridin' with the Phantom roof gone
Or the Maybach two-tone, and my rims are too grown
That mean they 24's boy, what are you on?
I'm richer than a bitch without the grey poupon
Yeah, I'm talkin' out of my head
I make a blue-eyed bitch just admire my red
I'm a blood muthafucka, a blood muthafucka
Forever like E-T-C, period muthafucka

There are no holds barred, there is no love lost
Nigga, this that crack and you know drugs cost
So P-A-Y-U-P
I don't think you'll ever find another nigga like me
Never L-I-E, I got everything I tell 'em I got
This young nigga showboat like I'm sellin' a yacht
Ya heard me?
Who else tryna smoke? Yeah, nigga, me too
Cause take my mind off the preasure is what weed do
Your girl wetter than the bottom of a ski-doo
And take a bitch from any nigga is what we do
So bite down ho, or get the right dentist
I told Wayne I'm goin' in like a life sentence
And understand I send shots at who it's meant for
Never had a mentor, copy that: 10-4

It may not mean nothin' to y'all

Put on my OJ gloves and go and kill this shit
Make a plumber throw his plunger like, ""I can't deal with this shit""
They say I'm throwed off, I stay on pitch
The flow ain't formal, I don't slack on shit
Bitch I'm back on my shit like a fly
Since you wan' be fly, throw you off the roof, fly
Like Pookie, take a dookie on the rapper loose leaf
And throw his trash ass through the window like Mookie
To a shark you just sushi
You ain't hard, you're coochie, Wally Oochie
Soft as newborn booty
Said I'm movin' slow, I'm just thinkin' fast
Look back, I ain't behind you, I'm 'bout to lap your ass
And nigga I don't rest, I'm up 'til my time's up

Uhh so beautifullll
Truly cold
Shawty need a movie role
I am not an actor but I'm stickin to da script
And Tony Montana had me stickin to the blimp
But now I got an actress stickin to my hip
And she hit me with her fubbb
You can roll the credits, and shawty is my fetish
And you know I like em redish and shawty is reddish
You know I like em fast and shawty is the last number on my dash
Uh, speedin like a cop behind me
Tryna catch up wit this girl like some 57 Heinz
And you deserve lobster mami
So how bout I make reservations at crustaceans for now
Table for two, just me and you, some drinks and some food
Couple yeah I know's a couple jokes
A couple cries a couple girl I know you lying, lines
Cup of Patrón
Cup of Dom Pérignon, cup of hound
Cup of moans, couple groans
Couple ground, and we get our couple on
And her goodies so good I can't make a bad sound
And her pussy so good wish I could wear it for cologne
And her pussy so wet I wish I slip and break my neck
And I took her to Rodeo she shop all day-o
And I fucked her Hollywood ass like she was from Vallejo

I wish they all could be California girls
California ca ca California
Man I wish dey could be Californa girls
California ca ca California
She my California love
My California love
That girl's my California love
My California love

Uhh but shawty got the nerve doe
Cuz now she telling me to stop, now she said she wanna stop
Now I'm callin one stop, where the purple? Like where the purple?
And my mama told me never hurt a woman but what if that woman hurt me
And they say love is priceless but right now it's dirt cheap
And we say we will fight this until round 13
But just like Mike Tyson we were not sure thing
We were only biting on a dream
In that boxing ring
And in dat box is a ring... a ring
Now somebody call Don King
And tell him shawty give me back my ring
Shawty give me back my ring
And the bell went ding


Uhhh my Cali's consist from Compton to the Valley
A few stallions in Rancho Cucamongo
So run those they say waitin patiently like a drumroll
From my area codes got em all from 213 310 323
Oh, I got bad one up in Carson
Soon as we met her heart stuck, she gorgeous, I'm falling
Can't fall though never been my morals, just plenty oral
I'm young though so before we start get ready to bounce like a 6-4
Now what's ya info? Sexy text me like using a pencil
And your friends been know, I'm real GD
Young Money baby no rental
But b4 it all end though, just remeber, I'm dat uhh
You exited on now tell ya friend to enter

Hit him up, hunt 'em down, hurry up
Shoot him up, shut him down, shut him up
Eat her out, dick her down, cuddle up
But bitches comin' 'round with the funny love
Lick me up, lick me down, done enough
Eat her up, spit her out, bubblegum
Treat her right, treat her out, trouble come
Got some cocaine and a couple blunts
It's ashes to ashes, dust to dust
.44 plastic, the rubber bust
We don't wear masks, 'cause it must be us
I got the Holy Ghost in my Backwood
On my tippytoes and them flat-foot
Bitch pigeon-toed and her cat good
I know her pussy hole like my MacBook
She Tootsie-Roll on the black wood
Get her own page in the black book
And it's startin' to feel like I'm attached to her
If it's that good, I put a stamp to her
I'm a warlord to these fuckin' boys
Double-edged sword and a bubble, boy
I just won a war in a Hummer 'fore I'm 'bout to come to yours
Lookin' for a war, I am nothin' more than somethin' more
Than much more as the punch pour
And I slunch more with my lungs sore
I smoke you and your blunt blowers

Telephone like a telethon
Bitches workin' bitches like a Peloton
Finish yellow bones dizzy, very long visits

I'm at home sippin', and I'm gone sippin'
Got a Draco with my arm in it
Shoot you in your heart, put some charm in it
Sorry, gotta leave your mama tormented
""Bah, bah, bah"" if she commented
Cops pulled up, and they vomited
I am not finished, hope they long-winded
Money long-livin' with a strong finish
Dead presidents, wasn't born with it, I'ma die with it
I'm amor with it, didn't start livin' 'til the war ended

I see you little doggs just shaking out fleas
I kill dogs like I'm making Chinese, food
Rude only when I gotta be
Sometimes I gotta tell myself not to bother me
""Tell Lil Wayne not to bother Weez!""
Shawty won't be on my team, she could cheerlead
Shit, like ""Go, Wayne, go!""
Ice on a white tee, I make a snow angel
Y'all niggas squares, but ain't got no angle
My shit's so tight you can get strangled
It's Young Money, ain't no such thing as plain clothes
Polo jammers, Louis slippers
Call them ""private plane clothes""
I'm taking off, going to another land
Call her misses, never going to another man
Shabba Ranks Weezy, muthafucker, I'm a lover man
Yeah talk that shit Tune
I gotta wipe my diamond grill with a tissue
I'm talking too much shit
I eat pussy and you suck dick

They call me ""Lil Nut"" but my nuts aren't
The same. No homo, that's how I came in the
The game, I married Mary Jane, I seen the
Spidermane, the shit that made Pinky blow
Out the Brain brain. Told Lois Lane
I can't be a Super Mane, my whole
Suit black like bat mane and I keep that iron, mane
Any woman yellow flag me, throw me out
The game, I'm back at the halftime
Like it's just an ankle sprain
Ain't no one could do it better
More hits than Eddie Guerrerra
The flow like ? at the competitors
It's mass hysteria. Historic in
Your area, 51 alien, what planet is he from
Huh? Ain't no fun when the rabbit got the shotgun
Picture Bugz with the shotgun up to Elmer Fudd
All my thugs get dirty like we running
In the mud, we 7:30 livewires
Plug off the chain, utterly untame
Put the gun to your frame, bitch a bloodstain
Hard to come out, like a love-stain
I came from nothing, fucking calling hoes
And flying planes; who the fuck could complain?

So you mad cause I'm styling on you?
Lights off, mask on, creepy siding on you
Get violent on you, you a sissy like Sisqó
Gudda: I'm the East gang schizo
It's no coincidence, man, I bet your bitch know
How I knock her down with the Kosher dill pickle
How I yell a nigga but my heart dark like nut skin
Bitches aiming for the pockets? You get nothing
Let me get back in it, bitch
I just go ahead first, you be on that timid shit
Get head first, then I be on my Jimmy shit
Shitting on bitches with that Chris Brown
""Don't give me shit!"" Niggas in the streets say
""Kill them all!"" Bitch, you know we got guns
Like the Pentagon. I'm just eating nigga
I'm getting my dinner on
And your bitch licking: getting her lizard on

Talk reckless, I don't give a muthafuck
I make you do what you is, bitch nigga, duck
Come for you and your kids like nigga what
Niggas with elephantitis ain't got bigger nuts
Young Money nigga: big dicks, big trucks
I'mma smash a nigga if he try to diss us
Go to court: the case get dissmussed
Cause if we did time, your main bitch would miss us

It's Mack Maine: ain't shit to discuss
I get up in a bitch throat like hiccups
I Chris Kringle bullets with niggas like Christmas
Then turn to their female dog like ""bitch, what?""
My niggas squeeze triggers like they got arthiritis
My dick big: that's why I walk like I got tendonitis
I spit nasty on the mic like I got gingivitis
The doc said I got a case of ""real"" nigganitis
He ain't got a vaccine or cure strong enough to fight it
See, I'm a warrior. They compare me to Leonidus
I got a set fee: I ain't about discussing prices
Cause I ain't tryna go broke like Hammer or Mike Tyson
Wish you could see my face now
Feel like I'm poltergeisting
See me in streets, be Street Fighting like
Blanka or Bison. Slicing, dicing
Like w butcher knifeing. Wifing
Bitches? Never, that shit is trifling
Young Money the fucking nicest
Put words together like a fucking hypen
Nigga don't make us start fucking rifling
Nigga we got a lot of rappers striking
Standing by the harvest for fruit
Waiting for the fruit to ripen
We run up on niggas and jack the for their stipend
Catch me in Minnesota like I'm a Viking
I'm with every video vixen you liking
I'm the reason your bitch dyking
How I get like this?
I'll pump a nigga breaks, something like Midas
I try to be modest, nigga I'm honest
And this is what I did for my birthday, bitch
I ain't get no pussy though",https://genius.com/Lil-wayne-my-birthday-lyrics

Fuck what ya’ll say I spit raw hard yay
Millz twisting up the sticky not that barnyard hay
We just getting to the money then get on our way
Yep, 3 whips back to back
Followed by a Cadillac
Trucks, sluts with us, fake tits and their asses fat
Gudda ain't your average cat, I’m something like a savage that
Came up in the jungle and adjusted to this habitat
I’m sick of nigga garbage raps
I ain't bout to battle rap
Grab the gat, hit 'em in his chest make a cabbage patch
I’m after that chedder cheese nigga
Where the cabbage at?
Gudda Gudda motherfucker there’ll be nothing after that
I’m bout to go HAM on this motherfucking track
In fact I’m better than a lot of niggas better get your raps intact
See me on that big screen and think shits sweet
Diarrhea music when I let this hot shit leak
Uhh, take heed and listen when a real nigga speak
Or slide on a razor blade up shits creek, nigga

Take money like a pimp make money like a mint
Gettin money is the only time life make sense
People like me, but people like spiders
And spiders eat flies and you know what flies eat

That bullet travel hit a gut
Then hit your fitted up
Hit your whole city up
Hit you while you laying down
Shots leave you sittin up
Run in the bathroom on your girl and get a titty fuck
Right after I bust a nut I bust the gun get rid of her
Y'a bunch of pussy’s having a pity party
My guns look like they in kindergarten
I’m the dirtiest seed in any garden
Got more stripes on my sleeve than any sergeant
The paralyzed feel me, the blind see me
And the deaf can hear me
And the smart fear me
Wh-which side you on?
Hi-highway to heaven, I would drive you home
Uhh


Eagle street where them twenty’s go for 25
Bitch I’m a boss I got ya ho in my assembly line
Here’s Weezy F and the 'F' is for finish line
I saved us from hip hop genocide
Medication in my cup, it's cause my flow's sick
Got a syringe in my drawers, call it dope dick
And my girls say you niggas can’t fuck with me
Check my footsteps look like there was couple me’s
We ain't promised tomorrow, but I feel immortal
Bullets beat yo ass up like Miguel Cotto
I’m the real Zorro, Rest in peace Toro
And when I die, bury me in all Polo
Kanyeezy’s on my feet with two pony tails

What's harder? Life or Mr. Carter?
Balling 'til my hair is as white as 
Johnny Carson
You don't have to beg because I'm fresh out of pardons
Little voices in my head said, ""Don't mind the little voices"" (Woah)
What's sharper? Spikes or Mr. Carter
I ride for this shit like a knight in shining armor
I pile up the swishers, roll 'em tight like 
UnderArmour
Coming from this neighborhood, it's just like coming from comas
I got-
What's harder? Life or Mr. Carter
Balling 'til my hair is as white as 
Johnny Carson
You don't have to beg because I'm fresh out of pardons
Little voices in my head said, ""Don't mind the little voices"" (Woah)
What's sharper? Spikes or Mr. Carter
I ride for this shit like a knight in shining armor
I pile up the swishers, roll 'em tight like 
UnderArmour
Coming from this neighborhood, it's just like coming from comas

I got homies from the old school and we been lost our diplomas
Got some hoes from California and they shit smell like begonia's
Got a bone to pick, I'm boneless, that's a bonus
Tim Duncan, Tony Parker, pop up at the spur of the moment
How you want it?
When in Hell, I'm a Roman
Head on fire, I'm a comet, heat up out my abdomen
And you know it, man I'm all about my business
Business handle business for me
I know you know life's a bitch, I turned her to a business woman
Mind your business, I'm like-

What's harder? Life or Mr. Carter?
What's higher? The price or Mr. Carter?
Should I call you Mystery 'cause I'm right here to solve you
If you start this here off right, I spray that on you
I made it, I made it with you
You hit it, I made it on you
You know the streets talk, my nigga, I made 'em argue
Niggas faded away, I light one and get faded for you
I'm reclining Weezy Baby, lazy boy do they enjoy you?
I'm like-

What's harder? Life or Mr. Carter? (Yeah, uh)
What's shorter? Life or Mr. Carter? (Ha)
I asked, ""What's harder? Jail or Mr. Carter?""
School or Mr. Carter?
Rules or Mr. Carter?
Man, ""What's harder? Drugs or Mr. Carter?""
Judge or Mr. Carter?
Mr. Carter, huh?

What's harder? Love or Mr. Carter
Especially when these hoes ain't right, these hoes ain't loyal
Shit, what's wrong or right? And what's the order?
I know this AK will get shit right and fix the toilet
I'll be a-okay as long as my wife could cook a quarter
The type of shit I won't take for granted, need the marble
See, you can't believe in all of the hype you hear at the barber
If the odds are stacked against us, they're likely to stack 'em on us
Lil Tune, aka no cartoon, no Hanna-Barbera
I ain't steal it, I took it, I ain't crooked, I'm cat and cornered
And if my fruits of labor were ripe, I would have an orchard
But I'm nauseous from my ups and downs and back and forwards
Shit, Mr. Carter, eyes are always on ya
Throw a five in the air for C5 like, ""Hi, how are you?""
Shit, what's harder? Drugs or Mr. Carter?
The world is on my shoulder, I shrug to get it off from shit
What's harder? Life or Mr. Carter?
Tune in this bitch, let's spike the Holy Water
Tryna stay grounded, my flights said no departures
Shit, what's harder? Murder or abortion?
Woah, what's harder? Death or Mr. Carter?
Is it easier to play deaf or to listen harder?
I'm like, ""Girl, what's harder than life for Mr. Carter?""
Shit get hard, but I'ma termite to turmoil
Was it easier to change diapers or back to normal?
Times are changing like Father Time just lost it's father
What's harder? To ask for sorrow or to borrow
Or to propose and get ""I don't know""?
I don't know

What's harder than being Mrs. Carter?
What's harder than being Mrs. Carter?
What's harder than being Mrs. Carter?
What's harder than being Mr. Carter?
Uh, what's harder than being Mr. Carter?
What's harder than being Mr. Carter?
What's harder than being Mr. Carter?

Female basketball players with cornrolls
And I don't like short-haired girls, no not really
If I do, she gotta look like the old Halle Berry
Or the broke Toni Braxton, the first Lil Kim
But I still take hood rats and work with them
Put yo ass in a jag and I drop ya quick
Give ya ass a lil game, if ya smirk ya in
I'm a pimp, not a simp, like ice in my drink
And I don't think twice or blink cause I'm focused
Rollin in the whitest mink like I'm polar
Bear, yea, let down my hair
Get jazzy on a bitch like Fred Astaire
Rose gold in her face get her red as glare
My Bentley plum, my Mercedes pear
I am lookin for a freak, mama take me there, yea

Hoes, let's just talk about hoes
Can we talk about hoes, these hoes
I don't love 'em
Hoes, let's just talk about hoes
Can we talk about hoes, these hoes

Bang Bang,Dedication 3,2008.0,"Shooting till my mother fucking hand fall off
Ya track-stars; the gun shot ran y'all off
I pop like a soda watch the can fall off
I can kill y'all and y'all boss
Shotguns, handguns, louder than a band drum
You fuckin with the drum major, lemme play you the anthem
Bang-bang-bang-bang, call it heavy metal
I say bang bang, bitch, I make you feel every letter
B-A-N-G, B-A-N-G
G-A-N-G, we spray then leave
We play when we, no, we play N-E-
V-E-R; C.P.R
Doctor Carter,
 are you the disease, boy?
Young Money, motherfucker, these these boys
Bitch is you crazy? We's retards
Watch Nina, Mac and Tommy have a brief menage like
(*bang-bang*, *bang-bang*)
Like (*bang-bang*, *bang-bang*)
Yeah, Soulja Boy on the beat
But you can call me Chef Boyardee
Cause I'ma heat this shit, and I'ma eat this shit
Planet Earth is my toilet, you're beneath this shit
Then I flush and wipe my ass, gunslinger like I pass
I cock back and throw a bomb, now, Hail Mary
You tale-fairy, fairytale, very frail
And yeah, we got them hammers, try and hit every nail
Let them sail up the river with that ho shit
Or leave them face-down in the fucking ocean
I ain't on no other shit, bitch, I'm on some more shit
That, ""Hello, how you doing? I am at your front door"" shit
That, ""Aww, naww, he got a gun! Oh shit!"" shit, shit

Okay, it's Young Money, what you know 'bout it?
The semi-auto will rip open your body and tear the soul out it
And all that fronting shit, nigga, I don't know about it
Call me Master J, bitch, I'm so 'bout it
Even my ho 'bout it, and don't doubt it
'Cause we both would be Angelina and Brad'n
Spazzin' and blastlin', blastin' and rat-a-tat-in'
And nah, I don't cook, but like potatoes I mash 'em
I don't give a fuck about your money or your fashion
Shots through the window of your brand new Aston
You get out, try to run, now ya chest where them bullets crashin'
Pine box niggas, no crutches, no casts
No wheelchair, just the two-door long black wagon
Flowers on the side and four wheels to steer
I ain't never scared, and I ain't never care
So fuck what they doing over there, I'm doing it here
You're nothing like me, fuckboy, don't be outlandish
We gorillas in the mist, y'all just some Kung-Fu Pandas
Sweet like Fantas, my blood is the same as Bruce Banner's
Hit record on the cameras, motherfuck all the bullshitting antics
They saying he ain't gotta get a clearance from Wayne, that's a disadvantage
Being broke is a foreign language for me like Spanish
Musically, we direct thrillers, call me John Landis

It's the 504 slaughterhouse blood-bath
Little nigga stand tall like a giraffe
One-man gang, animal, cannibal
Eat rappers for dinner, my nickname ""Hannibal""
Guns for days I show you what this cannon do
Hit you, split your mothafucking man in two
I grab the chopper, South Park, that’s how I hold the toy
I aim and crank that bitch like Soulja Boy
I’m in the streets one deep, I can hold my own
And shit, it’s only one seat and I control the throne
Look, bitch, I’m on my crazy ass shit
You see the gun poking out like Sheneneh lips
Watch your lips when talking
Cause I be on grave nigga leaking in your coffin, rest in piss
When I die, let me rest with clips
Rambo, I’ma go out on my Sylvester shit, bang!",https://genius.com/Lil-wayne-bang-bang-lyrics
No Quitter Go Getter,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Michael Phelps
 this for you baby

I’m goin’ for the gold
My heart is in control, my mind is on succeed
And I am in the lead
Don’t buy into the schemes
The science or stratege
Just giant N-U-T’s brings triumph and relief
I’m reliant on redeem, inspired by the green
Never tieing off of fatigue
, 
never defiant to my team
Never lying on the thing until I’m lying on the thing
Hooked to wires and things I’m a die as a king
If I don’t do it now I’m a try it again
And when I do accomplish it
I’m a try it again, I’m a riot insane
I’m a lion my mane hangs down to my strings
And they’re tied to the game, I stay dry when it rain
I’m tried of the fame
Got everything to gain and I’m proud of the pain
The pride and the plain, the wise and the strange
Denied by the sane besides we’re the same
Whose guiding the train, whose flyin’ the plane
Whose drivin’ the lane
Who dies when it bang, who fires when it bang
Who lies in the aim
Two lives in the drain, who cries when they sang
You hide but you can’t, you hide but you ain’t
I advise you to thank, you’ll find what you can’t
Revive what you taint, survive what you paint
Super-size what you shrank, the fries and the drank
Admired as a saint, defined by my rank, combined with my strength
My time and my length, I’m a iron out the kinks, yes I’m on the brink
And in the eye of a wink, I’m a retire in the bank yeeaahhh

And I’m no quitter cause I’m a go, I’m a go, I’m a go getter
No I’m no quitter cause I’m a go, I’m a go, I’m a go getter
Yeeaaahhhh I, I’m gon’ get it, I, I’m gon’ get it, yeah I’m gon’ get it yeeaahhh
Cause I’m a go, I’m a go, I’m a go getter

Sshh, victory consistantly
Train all year to be the enemy’s misery
No stress visibly, neither does it enter me
I think positively
You can’t harm me mentally
Not physically, not spiritually
You’ll never get rid of me
I am the epitome of this is what you did to me
Nothin’s what you did for me, nothin’s what you give to me
I take whatever I’m visualing
Now break all of the limiting, now shake all of the gimicking
The fakery, the trickery, nurse how sick is he, worse I’m sickening
I’ll be at the finish line first
How quick is he, I’ma make sure they mention me for the next century
I ain’t with the bickering, I’m full of dignity, I’m full of energy
Pull out the inner me or bull after dinner meat
I stood in the winter heat, it could be the end of me, but good be defending me yeeeaaahhh

And I’m no quitter, I’m a go, I’m a go, I’m a go getter
Yeeeaaaahhh and I’m no quitter, I’m a go, I’m a go, I’m a go getter
And I’m no quitter cause I’m a go, I’m a go, I’m a go getter

Yeaahhh I’m allergic to cheatin’
I hate failure and I’m in love with achievement
Above and beneath it
A hug when I greet it
My eyes on the prize
And I love when I seek it
Done with the speakin’ begun with the preachin’
Now pray until I am one with the deacon
Now play until I have won whatever we win
I play until I have won and then I re-win, yeeeaaahhhh

And I’m no quitter, I’m a go, I’m a go, I’m a go getter
Yeeeaaaahhh and I’m no quitter
I’m a go, I’m a go, I’m a go getter
I’m gon’ get it, yeah I’m gon’ get it, yeah I’m gon’ get it yeah
And I’m no quitter, I’m a go, I’m a go, I’m a go getter
Yeeeaaaahhh and I’m no quitter

And then we shot that BB gun
And they lost, and they lost
Til we took they shit, now it's time to floss (We lock and load!)

22-year-old 17th Ward vet
Life in the fast-lane, little red corvette
Little red handkerchief, hangin out the right side
Back pocket jeans fallin, cover my Evisu sign
Yep we do shine, and they gon' hate
But they hated Jesus baby we won't break
So we ride like four Pirellis, so secured
No security, no protectin no comparing
Locin' and heavy, Ocean 11
Aviators, vote-takers, so fakers, ah!
No playas, I'm Holly Grove to the heart
Hollygrove from the start, don't cross Earhart
Boulevard where the ward I come from
One-seven, one shot? Never that, blum-blum!

What the fuck! Hollygrove, stand up! Duck! (Nigga!)

We won, we won

Get 'em, get 'em, Weezy! Hit 'em where you kill 'em, easy
Sit 'em in the river, leave em, they find 'em tomorrow evening
Sinkin, I'm prob-ly drinkin that syrup
Thinkin I won't slip, even though I'm leanin like a broke hip
He don't know I got the nina wit the full clip
That's a somersault, backspin, full-flip for ya
Push this button, I flip out and hit something
Miss nothin, I'm just bustin until this scene clean
Twelve hundred for the jeans, stop playin
Hundred dollars for the Glock in my pants
Who the man? I am when I stand with it pointed right at ya face
Knock the brains from the back of ya neck for lack of respect, I
Strap a jet black gat 'til the death
Tell the mama to bury me with that, no bullshittin'
My hood getting kinda crazy where I be
So Ronnie's with me cuz he's the OG (Nigga!)

We won, we won
And then we shot that BB gun
And they lost, and they lost
Til we took they shit, now its time to floss (We lock and load!)

Fresh out the back seat of the Phiggity-Phantom
The haters, I make 'em madder when I wave at 'em like, ""What up?""
If it ain't about money I keep goin
I'm tryna get that green, niggas tryna mow my lawn, but fuck--
Them boys, I got the shottie on my arm
If them boys run up, I leave their bodies on the lawn
And duck the fuck outta there, 'cause baby, it's outta there
If this was a movie, it's time to roll the credits, cut!
Its all over, all of ya brains is all over the motherfuckin' block!
I'm a motherfuckin' rock!
Hardbody, Eagle Street, seventeen shots
Night vision double-clip, hot steady beam Glock
Pop! Drop, little man, drop!
This is not for little bitches, you man or a fox?
I'm layin in the drop, thinking of more money

Rest in peace Fredo Santana
Say that she used to be a lifeguard

So much fake love, I been drowning, drowning

I've been so hot, tell a nigga come find me
Been at the bottom, look down and I bet you gon' see diamonds
So much fake love, I been drowning, drowning
Pop me a perc, in my zone and it's timeless, timeless
I've been so hot, tell a nigga come find me
Been at the bottom, look down and I bet you gon' see diamonds

Don't ask me for shit but this blunt or this dick
Fake love in the air, love bugs turn to ticks
That's more than enough, Pink Floyd in the cup
Brrrrrp, I always pick up, 'less she callin' my bluffs
Smell it, like it, buy it, light it, hit it
Mix it with some molly now we gettin' scientific
Bought another house just to put more pots to piss in
Bitches got they hands out
I shake it like we just did business, this just business, wait
Oh my God, I'm drowning in her kidneys, she like
(Oooooohhh) I just listen
And the higher notes she hit it, I know I sound like a grizzly
And the cocaine look like crystals, that's that white girl, call her Chrissy
Hol' up, listen, see, you fuck it all up, you put that wall up
You feelin' yourself, but I can't hate, 'cause you got that soft touch
Okay, you standin' in rain and driftin' it
You lookin' for change but penny pinch
You swallow your pride, I'm sippin' it
You drown in your tears, I swim in 'em, 6 shit

So much fake love, I been drowning, drowning

Robotic coupe while I'm pullin' up
Was feelin' down so I spiked my cup
Was in need of you so I hit you up
Hollywood, I'm in a loft
Catch a plane, Randy Moss
Bag 'em up, ship 'em off
Fuck the law, what's the cost?
Please don't be freaks on me, ooh get the snakes on me
Been ""What's the cost?"" Get 'em in, get 'em off
Pop a perc I take off
Got a bitch , then she claim she from Mars
That bitch a liar, though
Say she a rider, bro
Say that she also a model, bro
Say that she used to be a lifeguard, savin' you
You don't see me drownin' hoe

Marley don't shoot 'em, but I still keep a chopper on me
Trap in silence, if they want you know that I'm a-(ooh)
Niggas hatin', debatin', don't wanna see me prosper
My flow is ill as fuck, niggas better call a doctor
Over when the fat lady sing done sing like an opera
Back in the G, 
I was flippin', runnin' through the projects
In the backyard with Tune ballin' in a pair of Balmain's
Last time I bought my bitches, I swear I love 'em all, mane
I be high as fuck, I be fly as fuck
My bitches is nasty, fuckin' her from the back, she callin' me daddy
With two in Miami, all for the family, do it for granny

Droppin' Choos, wearin' jewels
Couple thou' on the shoes

The craziest place I've ever seen a Lil Wayne tattoo on someone is... you ready? So, I'm 'bout to explain it, um... inside the lips of their pussy. Um, that's just the craziest place. So like, even when you see the pussy, she can show any man her pussy, he won't see it. She has to literally open her pussy up for you to see the name. Shout out- shout my homegirl, that's my homegirl, one time for her. I love you, girl. What's the craziest place I haven't seen a Lil Wayne tattoo is when people come up to me and say ""You know I got your name on me, but, like, I can't show you right now 'cause I'm in work,"" or, ""I can't show you right now 'cause,"" whatever.

She got my tour dates, she also got a man
But even homie gotta understand
She got (one night only )
And no one gon take it from her, nothing's gon' make her miss it
And when I go she'll miss it
But she'll never forget that (one night only )
Next day another city, she's never coming with me
I'm nothing more than memories
Memories she keep forever
She always dream about me, wish she could sleep forever
She get her fit together, she get her shit together
After my concert, she wanna get together
I get her on my bus, we chill and sit together
She has no curfew, I can take the bitch wherever
Come off a bit respectful, I'm on a different level
I got her feelin special, then she remember
She got (one night only )

But I can make you love me forever
Baby I can make you love me forever
Now all the hoes hate her, the dudes wanna date her
Her nigga saw her leave, she deal with him later
Right now she with the greateast, I'm even homie's favorite
How could he even blame her, she doin him a favor
She let that nigga love her, she let that nigga save her
But when I come she let a nigga take her
Take her for (one night only )
She turnin off her phone, she turnin off her pager
Tell hime that shit on roam, that nigga goin in labor

He waitin at the table, no breakfast at the table
He ask her where she been, she say stop trippin it was (one night only )

But I can make you love me forever
I can make you love me forever, yeah

But every woman in this world was you before
See everybody wish to porn that superstar
But when it come true, how true you are
You got the (one night only )
See, I can't be her man, and she can't be my girl
Oh, but we fuck like it's the end of the world
And we got (one night only )
I got a wife, she knows, my wife ain't on the road
When she come to my room, she take off all her clothes
Say anything goes, tomorrow same clothes
We probably order movies, we probably lay together
But we can't stay together, that's when I gotta tell her

I have no doubt, that I could love you forever

Flow crazy, I need a counselor, I’m Hip-Hop’s announcer
I’m in the gun club, do you want to meet the bouncer?
Been a beast and still I am, now I rock and still I jam
Few niggas with me got that white girl like Will.I.Am
Look up bitch, ain’t no ceilings
See me at the top controlling things
Anybody beat, it’s a mothafuckin' murder scene
I do it

Let’s do it, let’s do it, let’s do it, let’s do it
And do it, and do it, let’s live it up
And do it, and do it, and do it, do it, do it (yeah, haha)

Quickie in my roofless car, bust a nut and blew the horn
When she snort this Loius Vuitton and she keep the new ones on
Life in living color, she the one I spend them blue ones on
And it's right where you belong, girl, he make you Uber home
When he calls she threw the phone, I just cut the music on
Waiting for some Dominos, listenin' to some Commodores
Acting like some carnivores, after that we comatose

Told her, more money, more Prada, and the more the better

Skateboarding these days is going awesome. Umm, new tricks I've landed. Umm, y'all don't really know nothing about that shit.

Dipset 2,Da Drought 3,2007.0,"Kush, good kush, yup
Weezy, dip dip, Wayne set set
And I grip Tecs, leave 'em water bed wet
And I know just where to put these hollow tips
His chest, his chest, his chest
Yea, ayo, I take on a gang of gangs, anything, animal, orangutans
Gorillas turn to Bathing Apes, when I make it rain
I got a whole collection, I got a dope connection
I got a coke connection, I got a dough infection
No homo, my flow is as hard as an erection
So that's why it's ""fuck the world"" with protection
Haha, pay attention to the lecture
My words carry life, like a stretcher
Yeah, you know young Wayne in here
Smellin' teen spirit, like Kurt Cobain was here
Yeah, yeah, we got them thangs in here
And we will bang in here, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And the bank is here Lincolns here
Grants is here, Jacksons here, Franklins here, them dead motherfuckers
And the drank is here, dank is here, stank in here
Gangstas here, wankstas fear... that red motherfucker
And my city hot, ride with the itchy cock
Coupe with the titties pop, motherfuck a city cop
And I got the hater like, when will he stop?
Maybe a minute after never, set ya clocks
I'm a nut case, Uptown my birthplace
They feel me coming like the weekend on Thursday
We got Vegas chips, nigga bet bet
I hope you boys ready, because I'm jet set
And when I come up in the building, you already know bitch wet
Bitch wet, bitch wet, fuck now
Hahaha
Yes, um, gloves, draws, socks, tees
All made by Ralph Lauren
No shades, just my eyeballs watching them
Tattoos on top of them
Igloos for watches and champagne for breakfast
And sports car for lunch and pussy for dinner
I eat rappers and call it pussy for dinner
Yea, ask the paparazzi, I'm in the Maserati
Ridin shotty, bad bitch, Clyde and Bonnie
I call her Kami, that short for kamikaze
She call me Daddy, and never short with Daddy money
It's Weezy Baby, shine like a brass monkey
I'm never broke, never have a cast on me
Always paid, always got cash on me
I gotta feed, the pockets in my pants hungry
I'mma Phantom hauler, a shooter, not a brawler
And your girlfriend's a determinded Carter caller
Control a bitch and let a nigga hold a bitch
I put her on the corner shit, I let her make a porno flick
She will play the role again, whenever she roll again
Pop a pill, then roll again, now we on the road again
Yea, I work her, work her, tell her be my slave
Bitch I'm paid, out my cage, I just Can't Feel My Face
With Santana, we well riders, like Al Qaeda

Before we shake your hand, we'd rather slap you with the strap
A million cash in hunnids, now they bring it to the door (Racks)
20k for a coat that I ain't even wore
This bitch so bad, I let her shop, I made 'em close the store

Long money Gucci, ask your bitch 'bout me (Ask)

You think about mistakes, that's when you made 'em, yeah
The water's runnin', baby, I ain't chasin'
'Cause only in still water we can see our faces
Real shit, I told my nigga

""Boy, you better watch them hoes when you sleepin'
Nigga, them dog ass hoes be creepin'""
I got a few Ms put up for safe keeping
Long hair, don't care like I was raised in a tipi
Nigga, gun hurt, Nina said she 'bout to go streaking
Niggas 'bout to go to missin', niggas 'bout to go to deacons
Niggas 'bout to get high as airmen from Tuskegee
Niggas blind to the fact 'cause they don't wan' see me
Niggas don't wan' talk, niggas don't wan' reason
Niggas don't want peace, niggas don't know the meaning
Nigga said ""You're a bitch, nigga"", bitch European
Nigga we Herculean, nigga, skate service skiing
Nigga really overseeing, y'all niggas sight seeing
Tomorrow is what a nigga ain't guaranteeing
New Orleans had a sheriff by the name of Harry Lee
When he died, niggas shouted out, ""Tha-thank you, Jesus""
Cruising down the street and I ain't Caribbean
Ain't terrified and I ain't never been
Sippin' H-Town, lookin' like Jeremy Lin
I'm movin' slower than a fuckin' Maryland terrapin
I ain't got time, patience very thin
I will fuck a nigga bride on the day she marry him
I'm a bad samaritan, I'm a black American
Got white like a fuckin' Aryan, and

I don't need no pot to piss in, I just need a pot to whip it
I don't need no fuckin' help, I don't need no Scottie Pippen
I don't need a lot of niggas, I just need a chopper, nigga
Grave yard or penitentiary, I keep runnin' out of niggas
I ain't runnin' out on niggas, no

Now beam me up, Scotty
You gon' find your mommy chopped up in a tub
With ""Stop snitchin"" written on a note by her body
I picked up your ho and she wore something tiny
I wore something simple, she like that about me
My dope from the nineties, my dope ain't consignment
My coke ain't that diet, I hope you a client
These hoes be relying, these niggas be lying
These niggas who snitching we throw to the lions
Ain't no testifying, you know 
that's as
 quiet
So scream until you give your throat laryngitis, we so terrorizing
You caught up too much, you choose hoes to confide in
I know where you hide and that ho verified it
I told my homie, ""I know where to find him""
He said, ""You late, we already got him
And by the way, it was an honor""
That made my day, made me so proud
I bought my bitch some shit from her favorite designer
And a chihuahua
What's the occasion? Don't worry about it
I don't fuck with snakes except Kobe, the Mamba
Might cut off my hair 'cause these hoes is Delilah's
Let me check my wallet, my pulse and my vitals
Call me the greatest or call me retired
It's up in the air, like carbon monoxide
Bitch, we in the building, we started from outside
My dick is my third eye and she call it cock eyed
My bath tub lift up, my walls do a 360
She get so wet, it gave me sea sickening
Niggas expect some sort of leniency
I'm in high def, but why are you screening me?
I'm Weezy F-U, with a sick dick
Hop on my skateboard, do a quick trick
Playin' my role, even with a thick script
Waitin' on a revolution, hope I get a big tip
Smoking on Cee-Lo Green, lighting up a big gift
Every bud get nipped, life is so vibrant and the suns just trip
Anything can happen, put the ""Whats"" with the ""Ifs""
But what's with the ifs?
Just pass that weed like flying colors
Light green teal turquoise, purple
When I'm in a room, if these walls could talk
I'm sure they'd prefer to be non-verbal
Poppa was a rolling stone, worthless
Momma said I wasn't on purpose
That's why I got a ice box where 
my heart used to be in this cold world
I'm a monster, a cold blooded monster
I'm colder than fuckin' Moscow, kilos, ounces, Grammies, Oscars
Knock you off your fuckin' high horse
Like a cold blooded jouster, fighting for my life
Praying to the ring-side announcer

It's so simple that it's complicated, yeah
You think about mistakes, that's when you made 'em, yeah
The water's runnin', baby, I ain't chasin'
'Cause only in still water we can see our faces
Real shit, tell 'em

I don't need no pot to piss in, I just need a pot to whip it
I don't need no fuckin' help, I don't need no Scottie Pippen
I don't need a lot of niggas, I just need a chopper, nigga
Grave yard or penitentiary, I keep runnin' out of niggas
I ain't runnin' out on niggas, no

I ain't runnin' out on niggas, no
I don't need a lot of niggas, I just need a chopper with me

OK, I spit that, get back

Even the paralyzed feel my impact, as I...
Skim back over my words that's on the page
I'm lyin', I don't write, I get high and ignite
I got a serious mental plan and dental plan
And you don't want to bring the giant out of the gentle-man
Gee, golly, gigabytes, and a gorilla's hand
To the side of a nigga face like I don't give a damn
Even if he's with his mans and thems
I put his plans and limbs all over his pants and Timbs
And I wasn't fortunate to grow up like The Sims
But instead I blew up before I grew up, haha!
I spend eight and put two up
'Cause you never know when I have to do what
Do when? Do who? Do you and you two
And you too, woohoo, haha!
Now, I'm cuckoo like birds with my words

Uh, whose badder, give 'em a ladder
Tell them climb on up here and watch me get at her
The badder part about it is, these niggas hate
But you won't even get a bar on my mixtape
I'm probably on a boat feedin' a bitch grapes and crepes
By the way, that's French pancakes
Je parlons Francais trés bién
Garçon adore chaude lesbiennes
Pardon my French, pardon the stench
But I smoke that Grinch 'til my eyes squinch
I meant ""squint,"" I'm so bent like a dent
But bitch, I'm still no Clark Kent

Not to let nobody fuck with me

Not to let nobody fuck with me

We the ones who had good girls, by the pool snortin' up lines
I'm the reason all the bad college bitches never showed up on time
We the one who had Cristiano in Japan throwing up signs
Born to lose but I built up, always knew growing up
I think I'm made for this shit

Wait, I think I'm made for this shit

Hoodybaby in the kitchen when the smoke clears
I can clear 200,000 like my throat, yeah

Trick or treat, live or die? Let my bro decide
All this trapping in my Jesus piece like show you right

Moms was hard on me with grades
Had to turn them B's to A's
Now im turning words to paper
Turning birds to haters fry their wings and legs
I prefer a leg, I deserve a raise
Should be overpaid, I just toast the bread
I ain't burn the bread
Made it gold instead turning more than heads
Take a lemonhead, turn it into bread
Got the golden dreads, got me on the meds
Had a talk with Tez about me on the meds
Forgot the shit he said, I'm out here on the edge
Don't try to sell me, Reg
I'll knock ya off the ledge
I'll pop off on sketch
Spraying like pledge, bullets gon' spread
Catch 'em like Dez, all in ya ass
Handguns in the console
I'm a shark in the fishbowl
Running plays on my rich hoes
Sunny days in the North Pole
I'm a play, play my part hoe
Turn a rock to the charcoal
Heart throb but my heart cold
Short ride on a long road
Long days and them long nights
Big dogs and we all bite
Big words just all hype
Small talk, large price
Alright, not nice
Heart cold, hot ice
She sucks, she wipes, she swallows, drops mic
Stop light, stop running your mouth 'fore I run in your mouth
From a hundred dollas to a hundred accounts
Got fuckin problems, tryna figure 'em out
Niggas run in your house waiting on my count
Bitches in they house waiting on my call

BET Cypher 2016,UnKnown,2016.0,"Ladies and gentlemen, yours truly DJ Drama. For the first time ever, a one-on-one cypher, a one-on-one battle, two MC's. One has sold over 80 million records, a thousand features, numerous Grammy's and BET Awards, and the other one, hasn't done a goddamn thing. Let's go

Forget all my adversaries, I puff the baddest mary
Watch your vocabulary, cause I go Conan Barbarian
My watch is like Halle Berry
Man I watched my dad get burried, man I watched my ex get married
I used to pop X with Paris, I made her lay next to Sarah
We used to have sex on camera, I used to pop X and viagra
And act it was natural stamina, double cupping like Pamela
Double up her like a gambler, streetsweeper, I'm a janitor
Y'all weak like a calendar, heh, beyond weak
Yeah, I'm getting close to a billion in arm reach
Yeah, all I could see from my building is palm trees
Yeah, Katrina had us trapping out a RV
Heh, we dripping, and y'all weak
I leave your brains right there on your broad cheek
And bloodstains all over your offspring
I think the gang and police they all linked
Hold up, why you flinching slime? Call your henchmen slime
You know I draw down, you draw attention slime
Fiend searching in a haystack for syringes slime
D-boy got em flipping like some ninjas slime
See em tweakin', see em crying, see em limping slime
That some symptons slime, I can prevent em slime
Split your head right in two like split decision, slime
I been through hell and back, came back in mint condition slime
Hold up, now its time to drop the window, slime
Toss out your demo, I ain't even like your intro, slime, haha
I go hard, like Kimbo, slime
You know my M.O. slime, spit that A-M-M-O, slime
Hold up, I go hard, like Kimbo, slime
You know my M.O. slime, spit that A-M-M-O, slime
Tunechi

(Whoo)
I'ma make it real simple and qaint
Before I start, shout out to my brother, my man Kevin Hart
Go see his movie What Now?
Ay Drama (What's up Droppa?)
Y'all are like a old man walking down the street in a Pamper
I'm about to shit on these niggas (What?)
I guess that all depends
Wordplay, figure it out
Let's get it

Gritty grimy grits on your lady tits
Sloppy Joes, I'm spreading it, one all you hoes
Droppa's insane, the rest of y'all, are lame
I'm taking back what's mine, I'm talking 'bout that fucking fame
Whoo, you did it to yourself people
Droppa back, 'bout to do it to you people
Uh, that anger's at an all-time high
Yeah, I eat my bread, I'm talking rye
Uh, money coming out of duffel bags
Yeah look at your boy, in the duffel bag
Got the trash bag, dark green
Coming 'round the corner in that pure mint green
Hatian, switch it up, sak pase tou ka te te
Coming back in different languages and I don't play
Uh, Droppa, Droppa, Droppa
I'm talking 'bout my car, the old one
Matter fact, take the gun, take your son, you better run
Switch my flow up, let me get real serious
Cause when Droppa come hard, I get delirious
What Now? It's my sound
I'm not playing, I'm taking it down, come back to my ground
Whoo, Drama, drop the beat twice
Matter fact tell everybody I hate mice, ow, uh
Rodents make me sick, they can kiss my ass
Come back one time, Droppa, first not last, let's go

187 bars in two minutes
It ain't never been done
I did a time, get your money or let your check get you

What He Does,The Drought is Over 2: The Carter 3 Sessions,2007.0,"Yea, but she always say, but she love my style
And if I stay out late I'm coming home rich
Thinking bout that pussy on the grind got me home sick
Them dollar signs on my mind got me on this
If I don't hustle then what happens in the morning
Do the sun even rise, do the birds sing
When I can stand over the stove and make the birds sing
You think about that I'll be right back, ring
There she go baby call right back click, ring
Then she call right back click, ring
I toss the phone in the back, quick think
Shit you all I got, but if you leave me where you left me than be on that clock
Gettin' it, and when a nigga hittin' it you lovin'
No crying no fussing, just a simple I'm coming
So when you baby boy out there running
Don't cry don't fuss it's simple I'm coming

I know what he does
(I know what he does)
But ohh I'm in love (so in love)
(My baby), that's my baby, have his baby someday
And yes it's hard (so hard, ohhh)
But that's my baby
And I love him, I love him yall

Yea, I roll up on her in that earth toner
She can smell the work on me when I work on her
I see through that smurk on her, it hurts sort of
But I been in to deep since my first order
I just tell her don't expect the worst
She say she don't wanna be stuck standing next to a nurse
I say I don't wanna be stuck standing next to a curb
She said she don't wanna, I say shut up you pressing my nerves
She say, who you telling shut up, then she get up
Start packing her shit up, start calling her sister
Sister dosen't pick up, the tension start to pick up
She crying, she got hiccups, I'm tellin her to cheer up
I'm laying down she tell me sit up, I sit up
She push me down I sit up
She push me down I get up
Then I act like ima hit her
But I'm a better nigga
She can't find a better nigga, nah


I think about you when I'm riding dirty
Said I love you for I left, I hope you heard me
Case I never make it back, I hope you heard me
And if you ever have twins name em bright and early
Cause I'm up for the money I hope you down with it
No this ain't game but I can be found in it
And why be in it if I'm not gon win it
So I be playing til the last minute, you don't get it
See that ground hurt when you hit it, I wouldn't lie baby
But fuck with me and you forever fly baby
So far from the buttom I swear
Smell the work in the air, I'm there
You can never take that from me
And what I been through you can't take back from me
If I offend you then mama get back from me
But if you love then I know you coming back for me, you love my style",https://genius.com/Lil-wayne-what-he-does-lyrics

That Ain’t Me,I Am Not a Human Being,2010.0,"Cut the music up please
Yeah, I shall never leave Hip-Hop
Controlled by my two hands, they go tick tock
Around the clock, yes it’s my time, my throne
Better know the time of day in any fuckin' time zone
I’m feelin' like I’m on top of the rhinestone
Pullin' the ladder from heaven, about to climb home
Mental thoughts are sharper than a pine cone
In this world of numbers, I keep my nine on
And I don’t go to church because the lyin' long
And the preacher, he be gettin' his shine on
But I know my Lord — I am God’s own
Back to my hands, tick-tick; a time bomb

Yeah, don’t you know I’ll be (I’ll be)
Yeah, don’t you know I’ll be (I’ll be)
I’ll be here cause I won’t quit yeah
You can try lock me up
You can try to break me down
But I stay strong
It’s my own throne
Can't stop now cause that ain't me
You can try lock me up
You can try to break me down
But I stay strong
It’s my own throne
Can't stop now cause that ain't me

Tryna stay afloat on my inner tube
When they turned my city into a swimmin' pool
Before that, it was a livin' cesspool
We gotta get on our shit, like gnats do
Polices be on my tip, like hats do
But I stay strong like blacks do
Never saved by the bell in a black school
And I stay in trouble like Zack do
And in this game, nobody’s on my plateau
Therefore my name remains, like a tattoo
Yes, I take giant steps in Shaq boots
B-I-R-D-man Junior, or — Weezy F. Baby, baby

Yeah, don’t you know I’ll be (I’ll be)
Yeah, don’t you know I’ll be (I’ll be)
I’ll be here cause I won’t quit yeah
You can try lock me up
You can try to break me down
But I stay strong
It’s my own throne
Can't stop now cause that ain't me
You can try lock me up
You can try to break me down
But I stay strong
It’s my own throne
Can't stop now cause that ain't me

That ain't me
See I won’t stop, that ain't me
I won't quit, that ain't me
No, I won't stop, that ain't me
Cause that ain't me

Alright; alright, alright, alright
I’m in their conversations
The title's up for grabs, I’m into confiscation
Punch, shot, and stab; now you're the doctor's patient
Wild like an Arab from the Islamic nation
I get money 'round the clock, ain't got no time for hatin'
And these niggas ain't shit, like they're constipated
I get the coupe with the kit, watch me lobster red it
Drop the top at the light, that's when I be headed
So far ahead of them I feel outdated
But I feel electric like I’m Rayden
Used to play Mortal Kombat when I was a couch potato
And now I’m coming out the faders, no homo

Yeah, don’t you know I’ll be (I’ll be)
Yeah, don’t you know I’ll be (I’ll be)
I’ll be here cause I won’t quit yeah
You can try lock me up
You can try to break me down
But I stay strong
It’s my own throne
Can't stop now cause that ain't me
You can try lock me up
You can try to break me down

On My Own,Tha Carter,2004.0,"This is what they call me

Eagle, Eagle Carter man
In a '96 Regal contraband
On my way to the east to the laundromat
Got to wash that money and get on my ass
Gotta flip them bricks it be gone so fast
I got to do something I done blown my last
Dollar holler at your boy on the ave
In that Jeep pidico is what I'm known to have
Shit tend to be slow I put on the mask
And make it Halloween and take all your bags
I say Holly-holly grove won't you go and stand up
And make these motherfuckers understand
I say: ""Look coach they pitching at me under hand""
But I'm a designated hitter I adjust so fast
Ya'll men designing women, I'm a woman's man
I'm the Cash Money prince blow the trumpets band, and
They say they want the drugs to stop
But I'm a major set back when my album drop
I got that wet crack flow out ya mami's pot
I got that jet black four at ya mami's spot
I'm trying to get back door I demand it now
Yeah, panic now, you better pan it down
'Fore the neighbors they overhear me tear it down
Yeah it's Weezy F. Baby and his crown, the prince

This is my town, my home
This is my crown, my throne
This is me on my own
Let's get it on

And the hand gun is so included
Don't get it confused I want no confusion
And keep ya ho I don't want your contusions
I make my hoes stop and let the dough keep moving
A bitch over some money is a hungry nuisance
It's money over bitches that I am going to keep proving
It's Weezy F, I got ya momma groovin'
Out of all the Hot Boyz she say I'm the coolest
I bought my bag of oranges its time to juice it
This game is a bitch and I'm trying to seduce it
I floss, a awful lot of haters try and reduce it
But the laser on the 45 is eyeing you stupid
One shot to remind you who is
That fly little nigga that's behind the trigger, Wizzle
I'm off chronic combined with liquor
But niggas'll never see me like Momma Tigger
A 80's-baby a fighting nigga
I got it on my mind like a psychic nigga
I'm something you call pepper like a Viking slick
See me over the viking stove I'm whitening bricks
Or in the middle of the shoot out untightening clips
Pop another one shoot back while lighting a spliff
I do this you catching my drift
Representing with my section on my belly and shit
I am the prince


So roll the carpet out cause you fucking with a nigga from the royal South
See you either in or you out and if you out stay in cause them warriors out
Those vultures, them cops, and the lawyers out
I just open up the gate and let my hoyas out
No nigga I never call your house I'm probably somewhere taking Toya out
Not answering my phone, man, ignoring ya spouse
She leaving messages about me enjoying her mouth
Hey I'm ready to knock a boy in the mouth
Give me the name naw better yet point him out
Hey, me and the streets got a joint account
I'm from the streets that you need to be warned about
New Orleans whoa they put the gat in your mouth
And we tote a lot of iron to flatten you out
Few roaches but never had no rats in this house
Never tell on one another leave that in the house
Always been a small hustler moving my packaging out
I ever run into some trouble send them savages out
These niggas talking sweet I get them cavities out
I got graveyard fliers man I'm passing them out
Hey bitch nigga get ya ass on the ground and bow down to ya majesty now I am the prince",https://genius.com/Lil-wayne-on-my-own-lyrics
How Can Something,My Face Can’t Be Felt,UnKnown,"How can something so right, go so wrong

I used to love her, fuck it, I still do
Cause love never die, but it can kill you
I pray to Heaven's sky, that it never kill me
It can get you real weak, but fuck it I'm a little G
My baby girl thought I was fucking every little freak
But darling, I was raised by a woman, that ain't the real me
Still, she managed to to spill out a little me
Watched the doctors wipe the blood, from her little feet
And goddamn she resembles me
She's my forgiveness for every sin and penalty living in me
She should be living with me
But what am I to do when her mother disagree?
I do me, but...


I even took your hand, and walked down the aisle
It takes a strong man, to do that young and wild
Look at your wedding band, that's 17 thou
But still she took the stand, now I pay for my child
And there comes divorce, mama I had to file
And as sad as it sounds, mama, I'm happy now
And my other girl got a new baby daddy now
And retaliation hurts, she getting married now
And when I lay down to sleep, I feel like I have died, I can be carried out
And buried now
But hear me now, I am here and now
So appealing 'til I disappear, but still, it got me feelin' like...


I'm in my early 20s, now all the ladies dig me
They like that baby face, they like the Baby in me
That's why it's Weezy Baby, and please say the baby
You know that nigga baby, yeah, he done paid me crazy
I won a few Source awards, I haven't won an a Oscar
So I don't know how to act, like my sweet ain't sour
So I run to my mama
She let me smoke and fret about my drama, then give me power
I'm a go and use all my knowledge and get acknowledged
If the pro tools stop recording, I'm still ballin'
I know you probably don't care about where my heart is
But just to let you know, it's where yours is

Let Us Pray,I Can’t Feel My Face-Off,2002.0,"Like I dropped straight from heaven
Five strong words: rest in peace Lil Kevin
And this ain't how I was born
But this is how I live
So that's how I'll die, and do not close my eyes
So when you see me in the casket I'm a look right back at ya
Cause I don't trust none of y'all
Fuck every one of y'all
Now which one of y'all wanna brawl?
And overall I got that pistol under all of my garments
Torment, torture
Tragedy, catastrophe
No battery, just murder in the coldest temperature
And that means first degree
Even deaf motherfuckers done heard of me
I ain't gonna let you motherfuckers worry me
And tell that beef I'm Burger King
I represent that saint's sign
I'm so high I can paint signs
And if she ain't fine, she ain't mine
Thank god that I'm alive
But if he end it all today, I have done more that I can say
(Amen)

Let's pray (let's pray)
Ten fingers (ten fingers)
Together for forever (forever)
Let's pray (let's pray)
Together (together)
Forever, forever

The Lord is my shepherd
You haters can't harm me
I walk with his blessings
The angels be my army
Of course there's a weapon on my waist within arm's reach
That's my baby keep it strapped in like a car seat (yes)
Though I walk through the valley in the shadows of death
Forgive me Lord I had to carry my tech
I touch cash and get cheese
Play with that cash I bust mags, indeed
Forgive those who trespassed against me
For they know not what they do until they history
Gone, memories
Lord grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change
Like what happens when I get up with my enemies
Paybacks, penalties
Bang back, send em' these
Funerals, these people got to waste more Hennessey (yeah)
They got to pour it on the floor for ya
Maybe next time they'll pray a little more for ya


I pray to God not Lucifer
Devil I'm rebuking ya
Lord have mercy on my soul when I'm suited up
Daddy was a hustla, mommy was a Christian
Momma said prayers, daddy steady cookin' chicken
If I'm living life wrong, I don't wanna be right
Send me blessings to the cloud, hope I make it through the night
Dear Lord as you lay me down to sleep
I pray to the Lord my soul to keep
If I shall die before I wake
Then I pray to the Lord my soul to take
There shall be no other god before thee
Lord please forgive me of my sins if I O.D, slowly
I know I should not kill but I will
If a nigga try to shoot me and lay me still
I'm so sorry for the wrong thing's that I've done
This the end of my prayer we all say amen


Dear God
As I begin this day, my thoughts turn to you
And I ask for your help and guidance in everything I say and do
Give me the patience that I need to keep my peace of mind
And with life's cares, I hope dear God, some happiness to find
Let me live but for today, not worrying what's ahead, for I have trust that you
Will see I get my daily bread
Give me the courage to face life's trials and not from troubles run
And let me keep this thought in mind ""Thy will, not mine, be done.""
And if some wish I do not get though I have prayed to thee
Please help me to believe and understand you know what's best for me
I've failed you many time, I know
But tonight when I rest
I hope that I can say, ""Dear God, I've tried my best....rapper alive.""",https://genius.com/Lil-wayne-let-us-pray-lyrics

Drama, holla at your nigga
I won't lose me ya'll
This is the Dedication!
Rest in peace!

So now, I'm burying the burner in the bomber
I carry the concerns of my mama
I'm married to the money and the power
And still got guns on my side for my private affairs
Yeah, I know that water get cold but I dive in it bare
And swim through it alive and aware, I been through it
You probably never been to it, so now I dip through it
And they respect me like a pistol, I'm hip to it
I gets to it, like just do it, I miss doing it
A hundred shot drum, play 'em some clip music
I am the drum major, the drum section waiting
All it takes is one signal—you can get a cadence
You can get it catered, I'm at your service like a waiter
When it's beef, I become a nigga neighbor
I put potatoes on the heater, no labor, later
Now, how me make mashed potatoes
French-fry niggas, I bench, then fire niggas—bye, niggas!
I wet 'em up like rivers—now, flow by, niggas
I'm dripping-dry fly, now, squint your eyes bitches
I Dempsey-Tom bitches up out of new Bentleys
I'm old school like a loose Winston
Like, since when they make bulletproof skin?
I put it to your chin, and grin, and sin, and then, I...
Sin again; then, I'm gone in the wind
And I'm dumping my Scarlett O'Hara in the canal
'Cause I'm not getting stopped with cop paraphernal'
Now, I'm preparing to ill, not preparing to fail
'Cause my flow is for real, like the Sahara and Hell
Comparisons is irrelevant, I'm a arrogant male, yeah
I can handle it, I can graduate Yale, yeah
They featherweight, I sporadically ill the fuck out
And you can automatically killed, yeah
Peep the narrative of the New Orleans heritage
You can go get your evidence, I tell where and tell you when
I was prescribing medicine, you was getting your lesson in
I was getting my adolescent in
Lesser than God only, better than my last is what strive for
Dwelling on my past, I get high, so I light it up and smoke
Keep that Mary Poppins poppin' like a toaster
I'm Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
Can't forget that purple potion, oh, shit
You ho niggas is ass—that's ho shit

Poke Her Face,No Ceilings,2009.0,"Um, She said can fuck me right, I made her fuck her friend
She say don’t call her a dike, well that's gay
Haha, I met her on Monday and fucked her all week
Cause every time she leave she come back to the tree
She know I love brain so I treat her like a geek
She love the way I spit so I made the pussy gleek
Wylin' wit my niggas, and I don’t give a fuck
So I circle the bitches, we roundin' them up
I treat her like I need her, Im knowin' if I eat her
She gon' tell Quieta, and Quieta like the media
Woopty woo to the bloods, her lipstick match my flag thats swag
Weezy F Baby got nuts that drag
I put em' in your mouth till you choke and gag
I poke her face off and now she faceless
I poke her so much I deserve a bracelet
Young Money!
I poke her face off and now she faceless
And I just gave “Poker Face” a facelift

Chi Town girl, bag match her heels
Her ass hella fake, but it feel real
And it felt great when we had sex
I tore her out the frame, with pics of my ex
From my aspect, I love your assets
I love your mini skirt, that's easy access
Pipe game, never mediocre
So that relationship is over, once I poke her
She said she wanted a tour of the tour bus
So I gave her a tour of the tour bus
It was all us, on the tour bus
And she did all us, on the tour bus

Do My Thang,I Can’t Feel My Face-Off,2002,"Well, alright, I can't feel my face, I'm going first

And my grill is ill
Ice bright white like Jaleel
Did I do that?
Throwing up signs, like I'm in a frat
Eagle Street, bitch
See me when you want to, find me, I'm the owner
Them yellow diamonds looking like a fridge full of Coronas
Own us, you see through like cubic zirconias
And me I keep it funky like pubic aroma
Hit em' with the Glock
Put em' in a coma
Now what that boy got? Umm, glaucoma (Haha)
My weed is stronger, I smell great
I like promethezine, I'm in a snail race
And my watch reminds me of '88
Because I got crack rocks in the watch face
Bitches stick to me like scotch tape
Plenty colors in da chain nigga fuck Bape
Yea, bitch I'm cold like up-state
So icy like a motherfuckin' cupcake
Ya, these hoes feel my feng shui
And wanna eat me alive I'm like an entrée

Everytime I do it, I do my thang
Do my thang, my motherfuckin' thang
And everytime I do it, I do my thing
I does my motherfuckin' thing
Everytime I do it, I do my thang
Do my thang, my motherfuckin' thang
And everytime I do it, I do my thing
I does my motherfuckin' thing, ya dig

Santana bandana on tilt
Back seat with the heat, I'm warmer than a quilt
They lookin at me like they drink spoiled milk
Money tall: Jack and Jill
Like they sittin' on a hill
Ice on the neck of me, ice on the wrist of me
Ice in both hands bitch I'm lit like a Christmas tree
Different color stones you could call it a mystery
Big dookie rope, you would think they was lynchin' me
Chain on top of chain man I look like Mr. T
I pity the fool the day he try to get with me
Fresh Prince, got banks like Hilary
And I hit docks with the hickory dickory
I make the girls run fast like Benny Hill
Rims go round and round you can call them my Ferris wheels
Pockets full of bank rolls, money long as train smoke
And it come faster than a nigga fuckin' J-Lo
I don't play games I shoot it up like Halo
Got more paper than your job's got payroll
Still I'm ghetto like no frills
I clean the dirt out my nails 100 dollar bills
Cause

Everytime I do it, I do my thang
Do my thang, my motherfuckin' thang
And everytime I do it, I do my thing
I does my motherfuckin' thing
Everytime I do it, I do my thang
Do my thang, my motherfuckin' thang

The Other Side,Dedication 3,2008.0,"Aww, yeah
L.A.D.!

I'm all about that cheese, swiss or mozerella
Muenster, Colby, American or cheddar
When it come to robbery, nobody do it better
Notorious L.A.D., fresh Coogi sweater
The cleanest, lyrics is the meanest
Understand my English, nigga I'm a genius
Ice like a snow cone, writin' in my iPhone
Went from sellin' crack to sellin' ringtones
Straight out the projects to million dollar homes
Inside the Carter, cookin' 36 zones
36 O's and I break them all down
In and out of every trap, all through the A-town
The Embassy A.M.G, Young Money merger
I'm a Young Champ Like Ben Roethlisberger
S.S. Chevy with the big block engine
Rims and paint cost me a whole pension

I don't need none but my niggas and enough weed to go around
A tinted sedan, some grams and a loaded pound
Fuck what another nigga think of me
I'm thinkin' multi-millions, he thinkin' Gs
Nigga please, get your mind right
Fuck tryna be fresh, get your grind right
Cuz I'm like, so in another league
I throw my pitches at different degrees
And I spiril my pigskins at different speeds
And I hit threes cuz at different times I release
My shot cold, nigga, I'm hot, don't be tight cuz you not
Just be happy I'm lettin' you breathe
I'm the good, I'm the bad, I'm the devil, I'm Jesus
It's Young Money, bitch, the game needs us
Gudda Gudda, what it is nigga?
Kidd-Kidd, Chi, get it how you live nigga
My nigga Mack Maine just left the dealership
And Weezy just ripped the drop Phantom so they feelin' sick
Diamond rings, diamond chains, royal suites, private planes
Palm trees, big change, I can't complain
I made a promise to myself that I'll never be have-not
Nigga fuck being broke, shit
Before that day come, I'll A.K. stamp ya
When there's beef, I'm in the center like Tyson Chandler
Fuck what you heard, in the booth I goes off
Like the lights if you ain't payin' us the third
And you already two months late witcha bill
Clown nigga you's a lame, bitch nigga, I'm Millz
Young Moola

If you didn't, now you know
It's the million-dollar nigga with the million-dollar flow
Icicle chain got a million dollar glow
Quarter mill for the gang if you tryna book a show
Temp plates on the Bentley, ridin' through the 'jects
Got a pocket full of money nigga, Hand on my tech
I'm demandin' respect, I'm a man to respect
Disrespect your man, put my hand 'round his neck
Its no other than Gudda Gudda man
Still bout my money nigga, fuck another man
I'm on the paper chase, all about the hustle man
I be climbin' through your window like I'm fucking Bruh Man
Look, I'm Shady/Aftermath, put your head in a scope (Interscope)
A bank roll with bucks is what these young niggas killin' for
The game dirty on the streets tryna deal Yayo
Fifty clips at his hat leave a peeled potato

I call my nina bay like San Diego
Get me twisted and I'm a turn into a tornado
And all my riders ridin' like a Winnebago
You stay, but I'ma let that A.K. go
Rawer than a qualo, 
shoot you like Halo, give ya ass a halo
These bitches walk around actin like they J.Lo
But man, I remember when these bitches was just ""hey, ho""
Hey ho, how you doing? Me, I'm doing every fuckin' thang
Smokin' them dykes, I'm on that Mary fucking Jane
This shit so Tom and Jerry to Lil Wayne
And you MC's are just milk and cherries to Lil Wayne, ha
And bitch I'm greedy
But if I keep eatin' you rappers, I'll get sugar-diabetes
Sweetie, I'm a different species
I'll crush your two fingers into a million pieces
What the fuck do I be thinkin?
Kill, kill, murder and Benjamin Franklin
Your girlfriend is into them gangstas
And me being a gangsta, I get into your girlfriend
I stay still when the world spins
And ain't nobody flyer than the Birdman
You heard me? You heard him? Him being me
And we are better than all you y'all bitches, niggas, hoes
Enemies, foes, threes, twos, ones
But these dudes won

Won
The South, for real
Shout out the Dunk Ryders
Spcial shoutout that red flag
All the time

Ask 'em bitches, ask them niggas, Weezy baby, that's the nigga
Catch me mashing in a V, matching seats, matching feet

Niggas want peace, I make 'em leave here, piece by piece
Fuck me? Fuck you! What it is? What it do?
I been ready since '81 and I was born in '82
Hollygrove where I'm from, but we call that bitch the Zoo
I ain't never trust a bitch since she ate that forbidden fruit

Quarterback Weezy, baby, shotgun, run and shoot

I hope when we kiss we make you sick to your stomach
Stuntin' like my daddy and yo momma eat rubbers
I bet that I can do the mouth to mouth with your woman
My house is a dungeon
Yellow diamond ring looking like a little Funyun
Stand on my toes you can call me Paul Bunyan
Touchin up my flows like a nigga do construction
The microphone wet cause my words like seduction
And when we on the jet you don't come up in our discussion
And if you say you ballin we probably don't trust ya
And I know plenty freaky hoes that probably won't fuck ya
Even if you payin boy they probably won't fuck ya
Only if I say that she can touch you like Busta
But she might touch ya and burn you like Usher
Me and my clique be in red like Russia
I shit these rappers out and sometimes I forget to flush ya
Grand daddy purp or Bubba kush crush ya
Explode in a bitch mouth like a Gusher
Cash Money, Young Money, check the production
I am just a Martian prepared for abduction


I walk it out like crutches
Two girls jumped me like double dutches
My nigga T-Street know a girl name Dutchess
And every time he see her in the street she be cussin'
I told him he should wave the black flag cause she buggin'
He said the pussy good he said ""Ya dig?"" so I dug 'em
I'm looking for a real bad bitch with a husband
I give her much dick and a whole lot of nothing
I'm spittin like I stumbled on a gold pot or something
And when I was six I saw my role model hustlin
So I gotta hustle
These rappers talkin' 'bout a whole lot of nothin
You drive me out on Saturday, I sold out on Sunday
Fuck is the argue 'bout, nigga Tha Carter out
This is what I call a drought.. 3
And we don't walk it out, we drop top Porsche it out
They better walk 'em out, before we chalk 'em out
We chalk it out, we chalk it out
We chalk it out, we chalk it out
We chalk it out, we chalk it out
We chalk it out, we choke 'em out
They don't want it nah-uh
No they don't want it nah-uh
You see they phony I'm not
Oh yeah they phony I'm not
I Eastside walk it out, I bring New Orleans out
I am a Saints fan, oh yeah we marchin' now
Like we're a saints band, I play the organs now
And if they talkin' most likely I'm what they talkin' 'bout
My nigga T from the East roll up that forest now
Man I'm just trying to get my peanuts I'm like Charlie Brown
Ok that Uzi make the holy sound, take two of these and walk around

I learn something new every day (What it do?)
More money, more problems!
Haha! Ayy, you already know
I always knew I was gon' make it
Yeah, listen, man
But you never know what you gon' go through
Yeah, my nigga, we got this shit
I'm glad to be here! But sometimes, you wonder
Yeah, ayy-ayy, I tried told 'em
Is it worth it? But I done dedicated my life to this shit!
Cash Money millionaire!
It's nowhere to turn! (Ya know!)
So I'm in it for life!
I can't feel my FACE! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah, yeah!
And this what we do!
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Hahaha! I told em!
I told y'all! (Shout out to Bun B!)
Pay attention! (Yeah!)

Yeah, straight up D-Boy Seventeenth ward
Miss Katrina turned my city to a seashore
I keep going for them coins like Lyor
They gon' either respect me or: E.R.
Burnin' them bitches like a ci-gar
Punk, put a hump in your back, they called it Igor!
War? This shit is hard, any yard where we are
We call that cocaine rice, I got that Condoleezza
Huh? You fuck with me, chump, I rock your teacup
I say, before you spend a dollar boy, put up the re-up
Yep! Get up, 'cause we up, foot up and knee up
In the game, put up or shut up, I hit your head up
Bukka-bang; the Birdgang and the Birdman J
Lil Wayne, here to hang, other words, here to stay
Feel my pain! Fireman, I spark in the rain
I walk through the flames, yeah, all for the change, yeah
Call it insane but I'm a hustler to the muscle
And them new drop Bentleys look like pussy in the summer
So I'm fucking that, hugging that block like I'm loving that
Never sell a crumb where my mother at—run with that
You can come at me for beef and shots come with that
Your bitch come at me for wood and I'm the lumberjack
I come in that Similac Maybach, shades black
Looking like I'm tryna bring yay back, ASAP
Give it to 'em raw, no Ajax, taste that
Heh, fuck around and make your face crack
I know niggas that shoot dope, arms looking like a racetrack
Nigga missed a vein in his neck, his whole face fat
You can't take that? Well, I can't take back
Where I come from, so I learned how to make that
Yeah, turn that straight to a G stack
Stack up my cheese, now I'm screaming ""Where the keys at?""

Big shout to the Dipset movement! (Trendsetter!)
Shout my nigga DukeDaGod! (Cannon!)
Shout my nigga Hell Rell!
I can't feel my face!
Twin, what up?
I really don't think they ready for this
(The Aphilliates, nigga! Pay attention!)
OH!

I'm live from, block one, five-one
Where my young niggas on the rise to get a name, don't try them
Wayne, I feel your pain and I see your stress
How they think your people 'posed to get through Katrina
Off a FEMA check? (Nope!)
Coke in the Pyrex (Yup!); dope and the ice, yes (Yup!)
Mind on the highway, road signs, right, left (Yup!)
And that's the mindstate of kids growin' up
Still they wonder why the crime rate's goin up
Throw it up: Eastside, Westside, Southside, Northside
Fuck with my money, I torch guys, off guys (Gangsta!)
Hire men, fire men, send 'em to a higher man
(""There he go"") Torture 'em: vice-grip, pliers, man
Niggas turn to tinfoil when they see the iron, man
Pressure bust pipes, I apply it and
Move like a lion through the jungle, yes
There is none higher than me
Don't slip up and end wind up in the lion's den (rrr!)
Big body Benz idlin', higher than
A chick that flight-attend or Air Force flyer, man
Bad bitches, I fly 'em in, fuck 'em
Send 'em back home hyped, feeling like they on nitrogen
Just call me the Pied Piper, man
Still get the coke through the pipeline
Then off to the piper stem (Piper stem)
And I'm still getting paper back in rubber bands
I still got paper bags coming in
I still got that mattress with the paper bags under it
Comic books, Playboy baby mag under it, still!
I still got ties with my guys who don't speak no English
Them vatos, they got those cheapest (Cheapest)
Got no green card, got no visas
And got those Pablo features (Just watch!)
They drop off and pick up; I pick up then drop off
Then drop off what's picked up, and then what? I do it
Gangsta Gri-zillz!

And like that, we gone!
I told y'all!
I'm so dedicated!
Nothing can take me out my zone!

I'm light years ahead, gone
They give her bread, I give her head
I'm light years ahead, gone

I know she gon' hold the gun for me
Hold it down in court, and hold her tongue for me
She swallow all my kids, then pop a gun for me
Makes some runs for me, all the way cross country
She love me, she even rep the blood for me
I said the plug trippin'
She gon' pull the plug for me, I love it
And all she know is Young Money
Her ex is always trippin', nigga is too clumsy

Make up on the pillow, make me wanna kill her
But she naked in the villa, taking E I call it Sheila
I took half of a half, she took 3 like Reggie Miller
I just feel her like chinchilla
, had to kill her, Bryson Tiller
I know they gon' play this over, 
ankles
 on my shoulder
My face all in her chocha, for my bae go South Dakota
But my bae go even lower on that roller coaster
She just want a Tesla roadster, I'ma get her somethin' slower
Bet a Bentley Truck to show her, tinted up to hide her ass
Who in that Wraith behind her ass, you ain't even got to ask
She ain't even gotta dance, thinkin' boutta a wider ass
And she already gotta an ass, leave it in the doctor hands
Other niggas, not a chance, she already gotta dare
When I be in and out your ass, baby you sound like jazz
You ask me can your partner crash, you ain't even gotta ask
I'm breaking out the powder bags, turn into Iron Man
What happens in this house stays in this house
Don't worry 'bout that
If what happens in this house gets out
Go check your girl 'bout that
I'm 'bout to put you in my will, where my attorney at
I ain't the type to turn my back, got every type of Percocet
I'm working with the perfect bitch, her body like 187
Then we come together, then we cum together
Rainy weather, ain't it heaven
Ain't no telling what I think, I think I'm ready
My lil married homie Terry talking 'bout a gangster wedding
Oh my god

I know she gon' hold the gun for me
Hold it down in court, and hold her tongue for me
She swallow all my kids, then pop a gun for me
Makes some runs for me, all the way cross country
She love me, even rep the blood for me
I said the plug trippin'
She gon' pull the plug for me, I love it
And all she know is Young Money
Her ex is always trippin', nigga is too clumsy

He give her bread, I give her head, I'm light years ahead, pyoom
He give her bread, I give her head, I'm light years ahead, gone
He give her bread, I give her head, I'm light years ahead, gone
She lie in the bed, I lie in the bed, the shower instead, yeah
We got out of the shower, got back to the bed
That's flowers in bed, that's magic
She lie in the bed, then cry in the bed, I lie on her leg, damn
See they give her bread, I give her head, I'm light years ahead, pyoom

I know she gon' hold a gun for me
Always down in court and hold her tongue for me
She swallow all my kids and pop her gun for me
Make some runs for me, all the way across country
She love me, yeah
Even wrap the blunt for me

My favorite person to debate sports with is, um, Skip Bayless off top. Like Skip Bayless, that's just the homie, you know what I mean. Like when I say the homie, I mean, like when you goin' to Skip Bayless, when I go to the Skip Bayless show, there's always more conversation off camera, and its always like he can't wait for them to say 3,2,1 and we off. For him to engage in a, um, more whatever, realer conversation, I don't know if real is the right word, a more real conversation, just things like that, so you know
My favorite person to debate sports with Skip Bayless. I do have a second favorite as well, if it's not even a second favorite, but another favorite person I love to debate sports with: Max Kellerman. That's my dude.

Gotta get back up on my ransom shit, and put you (in the trunk)
So you lay on top of speakers
Holes all in you like an old pair of sneakers
Before I do a day on the edge I will leap first
Bet you any money that I will land feet first
Married to the Benjamins, battle all my enemies
Riding with Bigfoot, Harry and the Hendersons
Godzilla, King Kong, and if I have to park
I will open up my trunk and it will be Jurassic Park

You gonn' wake up all alone and you will see, see, see
I'm at an all time low, we don't talk no more

Now talk to me, talk to me, talk
Walk with me, walk with me, walk
I know these things that we said
How can we stop and leave all

How can we ruin something so perfect, so fluent
We was young, We was dumb, We ain't know what we was doing
But now that we older, older
Lets take these things slower, slower
Reset the button, button
And start it all over, over
I cannot stop what I feel, You ain't a notch in my belt
I ain't gonna lie to you girl, I want you all to myself
And forgive for being stingy though
Take you all the places that you swear you never been before
Why is this so difficult, This should be the easy part
Believe me if you need me, Ain't no way we finna keep apart

No matter where I go, No matter who I'm with
I always think of you, Cause baby you the shhh
I love your body girl, There's no denying that
I will not rest, I will not sleep, like an insomniac
I keep you up all night, You know I get it right
I give it to you fast or slow, Or anyway you like
So give it one more chance

Emmett Till Apology,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Dear Till Family:
As a recording artist, I have always been interested in word play.
 My lyrics often reference people, places and events in my music, 
as well as the music that I create for or alongside other artists
It has come to my attention that lyrics from my contribution to a fellow artist’s song has deeply offended your family.
 As a father myself, I cannot imagine the pain that your family has had to endure. I would like to take a moment to 
acknowledge your hurt
, as well as the letter you sent to me via your attorneys
Moving forward, I will not use or reference Emmett Till
 or the 
Till family
 in my music, especially in an inappropriate manner. I fully support 
Epic Record
’s 
decision to take down the unauthorized version of the song
 and to 
not include the reference in the version that went to retail
. I will not be performing the lyrics that contain that reference live and have removed them from my catalogue
I have tremendous respect for those who paved the way for the liberty
 and opportunities that African-Americans currently enjoy. 
As a business owner who employs several African-American employees and gives philanthropically to organizations that help youth to pursue their dreams
 my ultimate intention is to uplift rather than degrade our community

And my living room is white, my lies are much whiter
My darkest secrets are bright, I'mma need a sun visor
187 make your bitch run my errands
At the bar with the Dracula, ordering Bloody Marys
Got a house on the prairie, got a corpse in the basement
I see Hell out my window, Lord, this view is amazing
If I go back to jail, Persian rugs in my cell
Got the world in my hands, it got all under my nails
People under the stairs, better not fuck with my feet
I be so fucking faded, who washed the colors with bleach?
Niggas biting my style, hope it gets stuck in their teeth
I been had the green light, now please don't jump in the street
C'est la vie

 watch me french kiss the sky
Then ask, ""What is that smell?"" That's the shit on my mind

Keep a brown rifle for niggas like you
Kill you in a drive-thru, then go viral
Ooh, I don't like you and niggas like you
And Nino Brown's still my idol
The Glock 17 is still a minor I'll kill you over something minor

Go at your head like a rhino, leave your shit bloody red like albino

Twenty-two's, thirty-eight's, forty-four's, forty-five's
Tucked in my thirty-eight, mack on my back I am
So ready for whateva that awaits me
Run up in your place while you're sleepin, awake thee
Calicoes, ak's, Uzi-machines
Got ya misplacin your arms and losin your knees
I am takin names, so who wanna leave
Out this bitch with your brains and your dew on your sleeve?
I got the hood with the names of the crew on they t's
And I might make a funeral sweep, I ain't bullshitin
AR hit ya truck got ya hood flippin
Feet by the engine, head by the transmission
And I be right where I am mista
Me and my damn pistol
Me and my girlfriend
In this world alone, so bring it on
And imma have to sing you this song nigga
 2x
I shoot your arm, leg, leg, arm, head
The heater burner bruisa is on my hip this year
I shoot your arm, leg, leg, arm, head
I wish a motherfucker would trip this year

I got the scope on the tool I can see what you do
With a little red dot nigga peek-a-boo
Shhh the silence will speak to you
Hit you from across the street wile you tying ya shoe
Like Bang! Bang! say breathe nigga breath I stand ova the body with the boy in his tee
Say Bang! Bang! say breathe deep breath I stand ova the body with the boy in his chest...Clear!
Now the boy is a mess and the block in fear cuz ya boy up and left
Life is short enjoy what eva's left
Before you run into a nigga like me and meet death
In less than three seconds I'll pull a three-eighty
Three feet from my waist
Three inches from your face
Make no mistake Weezy neva hesitate
I'll pop till your shit separate like eewww!
 2x
I shoot your arm, leg, leg, arm, head

I Know the Future,The Drought is Over 2: The Carter 3 Sessions,2007.0,"Straight from the bottom of the cut
I give it to these bitch niggas like momma taught me
One man with no weapon at war, but I'm an army
My flow is captain: attention, lieutenant
Your penny pension and they demolished that invention
You better get your dollars up, and guess what, I was up
I get my cheese like Mickey Mouse, or else you better Donald Duck
Like a shootin' range target, I get all kinda bucks
Be my shootin' range target, nigga I got good luck
Nigga bye bye good luck, got your momma shook up
Lil bad ass nigga, who thought Popeye wasn't tough
I'm on that la la, twist it up, I'm on that syrup, slow it down
And I like four freaks too, and I ain't Yung Joc but its goin' down
I buy a marijuana field, then I just mow it down
Big bad wolf, yes, I just blow it down
No homo and to Hollygrove, I will hold it down
Like a circle of knives, I got the sharpest flow around

Future (I know)
Future (I know)
Future (I know)
Future (I know)
Future
I know they can't fuck with me cause I can't fuck with my damn self

Bitch I'm Mack Maine
I got the heart of a king, blood of a slave
Feel like I been there before, my second time to the grave
But it's one life to live, that's why I'm gettin' paid
Off a flow that's priceless, I just got it appraised
Spit like I need a raise, blaze as I gaze
At the stars and ask the Lord, why the culprit's at the pulpit
It make me sick to my stomach, that's why I rap
Like a pregnant woman, I don't spit I vomit
So pay homage, me and Wayne two G's
Like twenty hundreds and we keep the semis blunted
And we live like brothers from another
So fuck with him and Mack gonna react like you did me somethin'
That's a hint to you Davids, throwin' shots at Goliath
This the New Testament, where the victor is the giant
So you should get your weight and lose the hate
Remember males shouldn't be jealous, that's a female's trait",https://genius.com/Lil-wayne-i-know-the-future-lyrics

Crazy,Da Drought 3,2007.0,"I remember then, back in December, it was winter like '89
Shit I must have been 7 goin' on 8
And comin' from da kitchen was an echo from all the bass
And I ain't talkin bout speakers
I saw my daddy in there I would stare, but I wouldn't touch
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
Shit, I just knew too much
So I stop bein' lazy, and I became creative
And I learned how to create it
And all that pot's for me
So come see, or come eat
And I hope that she is having da ride of her life
No red lights in sight
Just a bare room with green lights
Come on now
Who did you, where did you, why did you what did you think she was
That's your ho
But does her water help your garden grow... no
Yeah I know that was crazy
But I think you are more crazier than her
Cuz she is no daisy
Shit she jus pottery
With no seeds
So she can't eat
My heroes had the broads and the cars with big ol' rims
And I could remember slangin', thinkin'
I wanna be like them
Ever since I was little, ever since I was little
I lived life numb
It made so much sense for me to run
When da 5-0 come
Cause I ain't dumb
And that shit I hated
Like early 90's late 80's
I was hustlin' as a baby
You can ask Eagle Street, about me
I'm a G
Ever since I was little, ever since I was little I tote my gun
Cause it made no sense where I was from
To walk around wit none
Shit, nigga you would be crazy
Cause niggas is crazy
And I'm a 80's baby
You should be proud of me
Cause in them streets
I'm hot like da 80's
And my temperature's raisin'
I'm at 100 I'm blazin'
Somebody shower me
Please, pretty please
You can call me wizzle, or you can call me Wayne, man either one
But it's Weezy Baby for your slut
I told her Weezy Baby, I told her more than once
But she just say, ""Baby"", she just calls me ""Baby""
She just screams out ""Baby!"" when she's on top of me
And the sheets be stickin' like pages
And the bed is so stanky
If she say that is my baby, shit it is possibly not for me

Weezy motherfucker, what it do? Holla at me

I'm a money man, yep, I get it from my daddy, ho
And boy, we can beef like Magnolia and Calliope
Hollygrove my barrio
, let that automatic go
Test me when I'm chillin and I kill you from my patio
Bitch, my shadow look good, I'm just feelin Weezy
Hop in my shit and say goodbye 'cause the ceilings leavin
Believe me, they ain't tryin to see me
Tell 'em I be the nigga with the burner in the beanie
I'm the fireman, she just call me when she steamin
I wet her up and put her out and leave the bitch dreamin
Niggas say they hot but its really not steamin
If these guys bad, then I gotta be a demon
Wayne/Wayan's getting money like Damon and Keenen
Try and take it from me and I'm aimin and beamin'
Bangin and leavin stains on the cement
Slide the crackers something so they tame the policemen
Left in a Porsche, 
came in a Koenigsegg
I'm fresh, yeah, the Gucci sweats came with the creases
I'm hot but I'm cold, I just change with the seasons
Tryin to put some cheese on my pieces
If you lookin for your nigga, I be where the water gets deeper
Huggin on that money, tryin' to put it in a sleeper
Yeah, I'm here, who the fuck wanna say somethin?
Leave your whole head empty like a straight pumpkin
Make no assumption, I'm hustlin
Your girlfriend guzzlin when you thought she wasn't
Name still buzzin even when I'm doin nothin
But I'm never doing nothin 'cause I'm always getting money
That simple, jackass, if you don't get it, you're a dummy
And them niggas that diss me ain't nothin but pure pussy
Sure, honey, I done heard what you said
But if a nigga really cared, tou'd already be dead
Just a young ass nigga with some old ass bread
Yes I keep them dollars running like them bitches got legs
Now my nigga Tez Po been ridin with me since pegs
And my right wrist is looking like a cracked open egg, that's
White and yellow diamonds, adjust your lighting
I got 'em so mad but, oh I think they like me",https://genius.com/Lil-wayne-they-still-like-me-lyrics
I’m Raw,The Drought is Over 3: Who is the Predator,UnKnown,"Mic check, one, two, on the way to third
Flow sick, put a straitjacket on my words
So sick, they think that something's in the herb
They think I'm gone, but I'm fine, like a woman’s curves
My personality is far from your reality
I'm closer to your girl, now come on, ho, don't embarrass me
There is no comparison, this right here be kerosene
Carousel, parasail, I'm higher than everything
What I spit? You can't drink it, like you're 17
I can show a million pair of eyes what they’ve never seen
And I can do this in whatever the weather brings
Picasso couldn’t paint a better scene
Colossal, now give me the mic and I rock like a fuckin fossil
I'm mad at the track and I beat it like Hector Camacho
What's poppin? What it do? What's happenin'? What's crackin'?
Que pasa? The hospital, mi casa su casa
Bad, I'm rad
And these niggas just squares like plaid
And if they’re cool, then I'm cold
I gets money all day like the toll, bitch

I'm raw, I'm raw, I'm raw, I'm raw
I'm raw, I'm raw, I'm raw, I'm raw
I got my brim low, all I can see is the flo'
I got my brim low, all I can see is the flo'
I'm 'bout to murder this shit
I'm 'bout to murder this shit

I'm a BET soldier, an MTV gangsta
I will be on VH1 when I'm done being famous
Explain shit, I have made my way
And you are just a stain, bitch, you will fade away
And I only leave my house to paper-chase
Yep, off to the jungle, where I feel safe
Like a home run in the bottom of the 9th inning
And I'm fresh like I'm by Mennen
I'm on the clock like 5 minutes
Tryin' to get passed the line of scrimmage
Yeah, and before I leave her thighs bendin'
She give me face first, like she done dived in it, haha
And if she tall, I can climb in it
I usually don't have a time limit
And eatin pussy ain't a crime, is it? If so
I should start working on my jail visits, you know
I'm in the game, they just sell tickets
Man, I got old bread, like stale biscuits
You feeling froggy, all you gotta do is yell 'Ribbit'
Turn ya ass to a statue, like an exhibit
Now let's get it!
Let me at 'em, leave my cage open
With no pyro, I leave the stage smokin'
Yes, it's Weezy F, bitch
The best thing since breath, bitch! Suffocate!

I'm raw, I'm raw, I'm raw, I'm raw
I'm raw, I'm raw, I'm raw, I'm raw
I got my brim low, all I can see is the flo'
I got my brim low, all I can see is the flo'
I'm 'bout to murder this shit
I'm 'bout to murder this shit, yessir!

It go; Uptown, Uptown, Operation Shutdown
Wake up to polices, go to sleep to the gun sounds
And you're not a gorilla, you're a dead monkey
'Cause I got a banana clip in these Red Monkeys
What you said? Don't be afraid to say it twice
And they say life is cheap until you pay the price
It's just like shaking dice, better hope you roll a winner
And if you are a rat, you're just a cobra's dinner
Y'all ain't fuckin with me, you niggas under a G
Like the light part of my feet
And so what them niggas left me?
When it get cold, I turns into Wayne Gretzky
I do's it like it never been done
So you can suck my dick with a elephant's tongue
Bitch, it's Weezy Baby
Motherfucker, I spit rabies

I'm raw, I'm raw
I'm raw, I'm raw
I'm raw, I'm raw
I'm raw, I'm raw
I got my brim low, all I can see is the flo'
I got my brim low, all I can see is the flo'
I'm 'bout to murder this shit
I'm 'bout to murder this shit

I murdered that shit
I murdered that shit

Thats so muthafucking good, feel like a treasure in a pussy
I’m a shovel in a pussy, or devil to them pussy

Before they start to shoot
Then do it for the troops
It’s Young Money salute

So sick with the flow
Yeah your cowboys know that Lil Twist
Been a pro way before Romo or T.O
No Witten, Cowboys to a Piston
A.I., no Wallace, your kids gettin' demolished
I’m bookin' on your suckers like I'm just leaving college
But smart, very smart - too smart for your knowledge
Too smart once more, Wayne called me a genius
It’s YME, nothin' gets in between us

Tell Wayne I’m goin' in like somebody bout to bury me
In this rap game, nobody could ever bury me
That's why you see me on stage rockin' with Young Money
I told my team I got us man, it’s all on me
Like Volume two B.G., I got my crew with me
Twist, Mack, Millz, Gudda and my baby Nicki
Every time I’m on the track it’s ransom
Can’t find us anymore, it’s random
When Young Money come through you better salute us

Better strap up your boots
Before they start to shoot
Then do it for the troops
It’s Young Money salute

Hey I solemnly swear if it ever go down
You ain't never got to call me cause I’mma be there
Let's get to the point like elbows, my crew harder than shell toes
Strapped like Velcro and is we running hell no
And truthfully, aimin' for number one, oh do we
You ask why I reply 'cause nobody remember two or three
Cross YM out of him we'll make a movie
We all we can be, respect the army and salute we

Young Money army, we marching
We coming forward, no warning
We got these boys running like Forrest
So salute me like a general
First place, never last
Always on top and I’m a chief like a Seminole
Got the game in a stranglehold​ no letting up
You can get the top of your can popped like 7-Up
Knock knock let us up, Young Money applaud me
And we’ll take the game out your hands like a joy stick

I’ma need my badges and my ribbons
Maybe it will make up for everything that I wasn’t given
Everything that I’ve given, I swear I’ll never give in
Just look at what I’ve been in and this is just the beginning
I d-d-do it cause I did it for my ballerina girls
Blowing kisses to the soldiers, I am Marilyn Monroe
But we shoot shoot shoot em up, camouflage me
Cause Young Money is the Navy better yet the Army

Better strap up your boots
Before they start to shoot
Then do it for the troops
It’s Young Money salute

Commander-in-Chief
One hand on the World, one hand on the brief
I stand on the world, bitch I stand on the peak
Of the game, and the girls, and the guap, now that's G
Don’t ask me about shit but money
Fuckin’ right my money long I got that 10-foot money
I get it fast when I get to the money
When I walk, it sounds like 10 foots running
I meant feet, I’m in deep like wet pussy
I’m a purple heart proven war vet, rookie
You can’t even sit next to me
Now bring money or death to me, or don’t step to me
Now don’t step nigga, march with me
To the steps of the court building
Like ain’t we God’s children?
I know at all times gods feel me
So I play my part until the war kill me

Ain’t I,Dedication 3,2008.0,"I'm the real, I'm the authentic, the fact and the truth
It's Jae Millz, brown skin, but I'm black in the booth
And for the green or that white, you'll see red
Mushroom bullets hit your body then they spread
Then your ass dead, no need for a hospital room or a bed
Just tell his momma to get him some nice threads
So at least he'll be a bitch ass nigaa dyin' in style
He didn't want to look up to me now he gotta look down
Somebody better tell em on these beats I'm a beast
Half-man, half-animal like King on Tekken
I'll wreck him, hell yeah, Young Money is what I'm reppin'
Respect 'em or I'll put you on that highway to heaven
Matter of fact, pussy, you'll get your own lane
With no speed limits so you can get there in a minute
It's Dedication 3, there's no replacin' we
That's like askin' a group of Muslims where that bacon be
Straight Grand Patrón flow, there is no chasin' me
And that amnesia is what my medication be
That's that Amsterdam grade A, I'm smokin' in the Netherlands
So high that I'll probably fuckin' never land, bitch

Muthafuckin' psychopath
Young Money cavemen, muthafuck a Geico ad
Four-four, bulldog, fuck around and bite your ass
Shittin' on you bitches, now lemme flush the toilet'n wipe my ass
Bitch, I'm ballin', I like my cash, no, I'm lying, I love my dough
Got them hoes fallin' like a hundred million dominoes
But I don't eat pizza, I eat pussy
When he wouldn't
Holla at ya guala, yeah bitch it's me
Kickin' muthafuckas out the kitchen heat
I'll put you where the fishes sleep
And when they wake, you'll be the fishies' feast
Yeah, I'm a shark, you see my fin, ho?
Bullet leave a hole in ya face, not a dimple
Straight from the N.O., it's no problemo
To put a nigga brains on the muthafuckin' window
Ugh, damn right I'm nasty
How I come through in that white eyed Aston
The leather guts and might I add in
It's black on chrome like Darren McFadden
Yeah, and don't be comparin my swag with
These wack-ass niggas thats o-so-swagless
Yeah, and call me Mr. Swag-more

Or open like some fuckin doors

Done what I shouldn't did what they say I couldn't

Hung where the other hustlas slung at
Waiting on the get back

Now my niggas is blowin up aves
If I tell 'em you niggas is holding up cash
Rollin up stepping outta the phantom's ass
Put cha litters away ur talking to a can of gas
There's nothing to say no matter who comes to ask
And murder ain't funny but we do love to laugh
Shit we just living take money take baths
Take a nigga bitch and fuck her
And send her back wit nothing
Now isn't that disgusting
Give him back his sista give him back his cousin
Yea, go make a stack or something
Go and buy yourself a spine and give back the frontin'
Yea and to end that discussion
I been had strength I just got the muscle
Fuck ya, this that 'n' the other
I see my people struggle wish that they wasn't
The government try to put us in a muzzle
But you're two fingers ain't the pieces to da puzzle
Shit say to each his own hustle
And I hustle all night and then go home to the fussin'
Then wake up to the fuckin'
Breakfast in bed don't forget my english muffin
Hawaiin punch tastes like robitussin
A nigga jus livin jus breathin jus puffin'
Come on mama drop

Dick millimeter cock back and murda
Aye senorita we cannot go any further
If my girl catch us both in the spot she will merk us
Pussy niggas talkin all that slop we will merk cause
Hungry ass niggas I tote two hamburgers
Who want beef? Who want beef? I bring it to your front door and now you seem nervous
Two seater swervin'
Traffic to hell wit it
Shit you can't die with it can't go to jail with it
Might as well wild in it passin and feelin' it

Give them niggas somethin' to tell them bitches
Smellin like money at a full court scrimmage
The fam at the table got a four course dinner
Young money cash money dump confetti on da winner
And yet he understood us so when we told em' break it off
Cause gangstas don't' talk one word'll be a war
And yo platoon can't handle the destruction
Hard body baby killin' sound like seduction
Them niggas chase dope bitches follow the instructions
Sometimes you gotta put the whole rooster in the oven
So tell the public I'mma do my thing
Just as soon as I hear dat bing
Gotta come in
Comin' up

And runnin' up'll get you in that wheel chair forever

I Hate Love,UnKnown,UnKnown,"She was the sweetest ever
Whatever happened to forever
She never say never, she rather say whatever
I’d rather stay together and she’d rather chase the devil
Now I’m left to race the rebel
Bartender make it several
Turn up the bass and treble
How bout I make it metal
I’m such a fatal fellow
And shes the reason why
Because without the muthafucker I’d die
I’d die, I’d die
So bury me today or tomorrow
Cause I’ve buried myself away
In the sorrow in May
I die before I wake
I pray I’m resurrected for her nightmares sake
But you love me
At least thats what she said
That whole weekend in my bed
But there was a speaker in my head
Saying “seek and you’ll be led”
But instead, instead I loved you
I was weak and mislead
I was deeper than dead
I was sinking in dread now I’m thinking in shreds
So I inked this in red
But she loves me
She loves me not
I hate love
Yeah I hate love
Oh my God
I hate love

I used to tell myself I wouldn’t do this to myself
Until I proved it to myself
And now I’m losing myself
I used to have my shit together but now
You see now, I with whatever
And now, you see, now, you with whoever, forever and ever
And everybody know I ain't acting like I’m supposed
I’m attacking my own soul
I’m back in a lone mode
I’m back on that long road
And that road goes forever and ever
I don’t wanna love no more, spare me
You can have my heart its only dead beat
I’m sick of the love songs and the bullshit
When reality bites like a wolf bitch
She’s on top, she wanna kiss
She won't stop, she don’t wanna quit
Then I woke up and I wish I could sleep forever and ever

She loves me, she loves me not
I hate love
Yeah I hate love
Oh my God
I hate love
And I don’t want love, I don’t want love
I don’t wanna love no more
So if you see her you can have her
She’ll be outside my door
So tell a preacher, tell a doctor
I curse the very day you were born
Tell my lawyer to tell a judge that I’m guilty",https://genius.com/Lil-wayne-i-hate-love-lyrics

Flow more rare than finding black sand
And I just want some brain like a fucking cat scan
I just want some paper like a fucking trash can
Life is a maze, so hows it hanging pac man
I seem to amaze, as well as advance
I’m so far ahead I gotta save the last dance

Get it strait like pans as I enhance
M.O.B I’m all about my chips like Lance hehe
I be with animals, with animal tactics
I swear I’m backed up like New York traffic ha
You dumb fucks, you're nothin’ but lunch ducks
Big nuts here swinging like nunchucks

I been on the grind nigga you are just a tourist
Flowers for the dead, say hello to the florist
Fuck with me wrong, bet I rush ya like Borris

I kick it with lil flu and he rollin’ up a forest
Can’t be compared no, I’m not a thesaurus
Can’t be banned I’m sorry Miss. Delores
Fuck Wendy Williams the bitch look like a dude
Her body look chewed and her hair looks glued
But let me get back to my food
Eat the track up and leave the mic barbecued
Why in 30 lives would you ever war with I

Turn the music down and tell the broad what kind of sauce I want
Scratch off quickly to a main street, intentions to make cheese
Let the windows down and let the purp' scent clear out

And, no I never choke but I strangle beats
And, I am just a player in this game we be
So go blame the referee, don't complain to me
And I used to have a cutlass on stainless feet
Passin' all day up Latoya's Street
Back when Scarface used to sing to me
Had me feeling like a G was the thing to be
Back when I was pedaling my ten-speed bike
Who knew I'd be pedaling the six-speed white
Big dog through the yard where the little dogs bite

It's Young Moolah, applaud my team
And we prefer red carpet if the floor's not clean
It's Mister, it's the microphone fiend
And they running with my words like I'm writing on jeans
Yeah, and if the lights could all scream
They'd sing my song, I like to be seen
I deserve to be heard if anything else
So I fear God and the world going deaf
Can you hear me now? Heh
Even the hip-hop vets tell me I'm the..

Scary!
Don't stop the beat Diesel
Cause I got the heat Diesel
Like diesel, yeah..

Heh I put it down like it's too heavy
But how can I with the world in my hands
Heaven in my plans
I swear I am important like the evidence I'm saying
I'm just trying to make my alphabets as heavy as I can
How do I live, whem I'm as deadly as I am?
I get props and every other extra credit that I can
Cause see, I respect the merit of a fan
No homo but please blow me to Japan
Okay I'm getting hotter I'mma need another fan
I keep going so here I go again
Always trying to be better than I am
Label me the best and in the throne I will stand
Why? Because I'm just a standup guy
Your hands smoking me cause I got your hands high
I pop a bean and bang Ja Rule when I Cry
You only know me but God knows I try
No x-ray show my insides
And I gotta stay in touch with my pimp side
So, tell your girl I said what's up.. I said hi..
She like that's what's up.. like the sky..
Byrd Gang taking off bitch watch em fly
And paint the sky red like the Crimson Tide
Flow retarded, Special Olympics kind
That gold medal heavy but it fit just fine
So, I just had to spit this rhyme
Spit like I'm trying to tongue kiss this rhyme
Some say greatness gets better with time
So I bought a zillion watches but don't watch mine
You little fucks are so i-ron-ical
Nickel plus fo' is a nine millimeter
No starch but I tote i-ron
All out in the open like I'm in I-ran
Young, champ-i-on, like a lamp I'm on
But um, I could clap and then lights off
Take no nights off but my days the same
And people change but fuck it nothing stays the same
And naw I ain't speaking so don't wave the blame
Lock me up but you could never cave the blame
Gasoline, can you invision if our gaze was flames
No you can not stop my vibe, couple page a game
Dang, a game? Yep, well gimme some baby flames
And if this camera shoots me dead, Lord save my chains
Lord save the rings, I am way too vain hehe
Listen to that Kanye again
I play the game like I made the games
You playing like your trying to get traded mane
And you ain't gotta call me the greatest mane
But I am more of a dog than the greatest dane
You boys acting like ladies mane
Crying like you bout to have babies mane
And you can find me grinding on the days we playin'
And that's because I know the sun'll raise again
And when it do I'mma praise the mane
They say you crazy Wayne, but I just bake em mane
And that's Ms. Baker saying, that I'm the...

Hehe yeah
So, now I got..
I got the, I got the, I got the R&B vets saying I'm the..

Grew Up a Screw Up,Lil Weezy Ana,2006.0,"Grew up a fuckin' screw-up
Got introduced to the game, to the game
And fuckin' blew up

I blew up before I grew up
Got introduced to the game
Now I'm at they head like crew cuts
Suit up and lace your boots up, it's war time
It's Weezy baby, no crying, no lying
These motherfuckers is slippin', they better hold on
They trippin' like Cedric and Solange
I flow like I'm headless, no mind
I can say don't rhyme and it's gonna rhyme
I'm so fresh, I should be smacked like Dee Barnes
And you get smacked like a baseball by B. Bonds
I'm to the point, I could kill a nigga with three lines
Watch this
With, three, lines
We got that Tussin and blunts is dipped three times
We light them motherfuckers up and get tree high
And in the game I'm manning up like Eli
R.I.P B.I


Believe that
I say, I say believe that
I got my nigga Tity Boi
Duffle bag boss
Yessir
(Weezy whats happenin')

Gucci belt, Gucci glasses
Four door coupe and the roof no magic
Voila
So don't worry 'bout my other profession
Cause it, I send shots in the other direction
The old me the Rollie, the new me the ruby
Jacuzzi, the movies
The groupies, the two pieces
And all the animals that dearly departed
Know that my mink game is really retarted
I pumped a few packs, caught a few charges
Made a few stacks and drove a few carses
I go to the mall and buy a few closets
The rap Fernando Vargas
Got my hand on my strap
Aimed at my target
Duffle bag boy in some high-top Pradas
Get it, straight killin em'
I push weight and move pack

When I Sleep,UnKnown,2011.0,"Let you know something about me
I'm a Southern boy! Know what I'm talking about?

I remember all the days stuck in December
Caught in the rain, all the pain, having no money come my way
But now I'm making money even when I sleep
Eyes wide awake, but I really need a dream
We hustle, hustle

I go by Weezy, baby, so call me ""Lil Weezle""
My city is New Orleans, baby, my street is Eagle
And that's my nigga's ?
He like to break a piece
He got the gun, I got the rope, my nigga pick a tree
Ain't talking money, I let the nickel speak
Niggas think I'm cheap, 
you ain't gon cent to me
The only thing to be: a picture on your shirt
No homo: I put your dick in the dirt
Flip em like a shovel with that wrist work
I stop ya, heard? I keep em coming like clockwork
J cool with the jump, it's an outburst
And we gon' be from South Philly til the South dirt
Baton Rouge, Lafayette or the Outskirts
It's lilWeezyana stay in your house jerk
,
This ain't a concert, this ain't a hot verse
This a lot worse, so hear the shot burst:

Every hustle, we hustle, hustle - hey!

Straight from the bottom, now I'm high as a mountain
From the city where you need way more protection than a condom
Had a dream but I'm conscious, see the veins in my sockets
In the sky, wishing I could turn this plane into a rocket
And just leave here, more money but the problems still live here
I feel the pressure from my lil peers
Cause I'm about to blow, Swisher Sweet breathe in
One hit, lose your breath, all I do is (breathe) win
Big fish swimming in the deep end
No present, fuck I'm into pretense
I remember rainfall in the street
Now I'm in the club: watch me make this bitch precipitate
I promised to myself I would be the best
You could say I'm crazy or a mess
Just hand me a wrench
And it's nothing you can tell a ho
Life is just a bitch, I'll forgive her but I'll never forget",https://genius.com/Lil-wayne-when-i-sleep-lyrics
Moment of Clarity Freestyle,The Prefix,2004,"Fix, Nigga
Change mind sporadically, same time compatibly
Wayne Carter, graduate, bang bang academy
Change my reality, thank God for grabbin' me
Sort of like him, cause they can't stop the wrath of me
But, Hell have no fury, Neither I
I would walk up in the Devil's Kitchen, eat a pie
Greedy eye, never full, getting fat
And bitch I got an itch, so don't let me catch you with the scra-scra-
Scratch y'all niggas off the face of the Earth
Even Mase came back for the money outta church
So with that on my mission for that money, I'mma work
My divine intervention might be in that woman's purse
Tryna find a better system, but I'm running out of perks
Baby daughter tummy irks, then daddy heart hurts
So daddy pop at 'em until they heart burst
For my baby girl candy I make her starburst
9/11 was a fucking shame, I done saw worse like
What if that bullet would have hit my heart first
Life, would it be different, I be still fuckin' 'round with death
Cause I got shot after that, and after that I grab the empty case
And then tried to throw that bitch back at they faces, Cita I made it
My nigga Real was on the ground like ""naw"", I got up and looked around, and grabbed the spot like ""ahhh...""
I""m hard to kill, hardy har, cut the music back up and keep the party goin'
Fuck 'em, and I don't need no crease, I'm a motherfucking gangster off Eagle Street
I don't need the Hot Boys, I still keep my heat
And I ain't gotta squad up, I still keep my feet
They call me Michelangelo, you paint them so street
But you remove that wallpaper, bet that sheet-rock weak, (haha)
And you and I know what's goin' on, you probably riding to a different song
I'm probably riding on some different chrome, I'm probably high in a different zone
But when I'm off, we can get it on
I take no days off catch that shit for my friend
I clock out when I punch in, I'm shootin
Reel you ain't gotta block out, it's goin' in 'em
Them rats stop hatin' on the snake, the boy venom
The cat like Payton for the Lakers gon' win 'em
I'm certified stamp, I'm a champion
Like Buju Banton, I shoot you nine times like you was Fifty
But you won't be as likely as Fifty, I light me some Piffy
Light hella bright on the Infi, like what nigga, like me or lift me
I don't duck I be right in the city, for them bucks
I take me a flight, and come and get right, right in ya city
Yup, I'm just like Diddy, and nothing like Puff yeah
I'm something like city, he something like Young Wizzy
My Nike's is spiffy, I'm hardly a Gotti
I'm slightly a Nitti, all of a Carter
Bitch niggas never bitch me, bum niggas never ditch me
Shit I gotta get me, man I'm raw, slip me

Stand over the stove and then I whip it like a slave


B double O, Ohhhhh
In that coupe like don't whip me no more
Look how I whip it ohhhh, called child abuse
Let 'em out the cage, grilled chick filets
Pyrex looking like a glass of lemonade
Snow white, no dwarfs, just snow flakes
Stainless steel stove match the microwave
Metallic lambo, inside suede
Program to get it, I run off double A's
I whip it like I
I whip it like I
I whip it like Joe Jackson used to whip Mike
I whip it like Penny got it on Good Times
Sunrise cook them yams up sunny side

Whip it like a slave
Whip it like a slave
Stand over the stove and whip it like a slave

I'm talking 36 ounces
Treat 'em like Chris Brown
Enough bricks I can build a townhouse


Okay new day new yay
Then I whip it like Kunta Kinte
I'm talking sugar talking dough like a beignet
I take a brick karate chop it like a sensei
Haha, I does it the YM way
A bunch of drugs, bunch of money, bunch of 
templates
Bunch of ice, bunch of guns, bunch of switchblades
Fuck with my bunch of bunch of niggas up in his face
Check my pockets more money than lint
Check my kitchen every spoon in there bent
Check my dishes residue like a bitch
Big boy weight my residue like half a brick

Challenge me, that'd be to my advantage
I'm outstandin' like standin' outside
Up in the twister and walkin'
Not damaged
Standin' outside up in the blizzard
And walkin' hot handed
Servin' nickle bags in Iraq
Bet I will not panic
Swerve the nickle black if I wreck
Bet I will not panic
Cop another one the next day
And drive it crazier
The seat to be lazier
Shit'll be gravier
Nina Sarafeena my girl, so then I baby her
Waving her at two crazy
Fugazez I'm too brazy
Three brazies deep
We got 380's and P80's
Nice 9's, M10's
M1's and 12 Gauges
Shell casings
Money put up for jail cases
Bail making
My momma say
Tuck your chain son!
They'll take it
I hit her with one of them stale faces
Like, I'll be damned mama
They know who I am mama
I'm still your little boy
But to them I'm the man mama
Fuck with your boy man
Hollygrove the hood nigga
Throw it in your face

Poppin Them Bottles,Dedication 2,2006.0,"Now ever since I could remember I been poppin them bottles
Pop, poppin them bottles, pop, poppin them bottles
Now ever since I could remember I been smokin that dro
With my motherfucking pistol in my hand

When it comes to the bread, I got the keys to the bakery
These niggas out here trippin, sellin ki's to them agencies
My bitch keep saying that the judge got a date for me
I tell the silly bitch and ya honor, they can wait for me
I'm gone in the coupe with the roof steady chasing me
Shine so hard like the fucking sun facing me, basically
Take it how you take it, I be making you be hating me
Loving me but hating me, ho you got to pay for me
Riding in the big boys, sitting on them grown folks
Every time I park, it's a motherfucking car show
I guess I'm the number one Lakers fan
Yellow bottle, yellow bottle, purple bag, purple bag

Now ever since I could remember I been poppin them bottles
Pop, poppin them bottles, pop, poppin them bottles

With my motherfucking pistol in my hand
Now ever since I could remember I been poppin them bottles
Pop, poppin them bottles, pop, poppin them bottles
Now ever since I could remember I been smokin that dro
With my motherfucking pistol in my hand

Well they know me as the Curren$y, but some call me the Hot Spitta
Sittin in the Chevy on three wheels like a tricycle
Always been a fly nigga since I was a little one
Bottle pop like the NBA finals is what we won
I puff a lot of blunts with my nigga Weezy B
One night I was so high I thought that I forgot how to read
Young Money flyboys, mami, weed a different breed
Throwing parties at secret locations somewhere on the beach
We off in Prive, Patron shots for the models
And send a bottle of that Cris' up to the DJ
I live by these rules, only money over bitches
And it been like that ever since I could remember

Now ever since I could remember I been poppin them bottles
Pop, poppin them bottles, pop, poppin them bottles

Now ever since I could remember I been smokin that dro
With my motherfucking pistol in my hand

I just copped me some purp, I'm bout to open up
I put my heart in my prices, see I'mma show you love
See I front you an ounce to get you started clown
And you ain't got to go to Mickie D's for quarter pounds
I be in A-Town, livin' la vida la loca
Throwin that money on chichas, spendin' a stack up in Strokers
Yes I'm an animal, to be frank I'm a dog
If it's that time of the month, baby girl I need some skull
Some mouth and lip service, that'd be perfect
You saw the rims on the Benz and you got nervous
But I'm a G, yep, I pop my collar, hop in Impalas
Ride for the dollars, hit the club, go straight to the bar, and pop my bottles

And when I hit the ground I sunk
Yeah they thought I was down, I'm up
I was lost now I'm found, what's up
I came too far around to give up
When I was down on my dick
Everybody was missing, they thought I would miss them
But I got in that kitchen and cooked up this wisdom
I started a system
If you really love your niggas you'd never risk them, yeah

Your child is so precious

It was paternally mine
But karma is a message
But I'mma try to test it
And scream for a blessing

And one day you would come fallin
Out of the most highest cloud
Then ill be there to catch you

I'm so bad, my shadow chooses not to follow
Little nigga, but see me as a fuckin' rhino
Lil Weezy hit this bitch like Rocky Marciano
It's a drought ain't it? How the fuck would I know?
Nigga, I've been getting my share in like Sonny Bono
I ran the streets... check my bio
I started high with two O's just like Ohio
I'm fuckin' nuts; cashews
But I'm so DC like fat shoes
I skate away, like ""Later dudes""
Never get caught, baby, I'm mashed potato smooth
And just when it stopped, I made it move
Respect me nigga I'm a dog; no Asian food
I wet up the party, so have a bathin' suit
And daisy dukes you bitch ass nigga

Keep talking that shit that you talking
And we gone have to get into some gangsta shit
My nigga... keep talking that shit that you talking
And we gone have to get into some gangsta shit
My nigga... Cause you ain't really even 'bout all that
You ain't really even 'bout all that
And don't you forget.. I know ya, you ain't 'bout all that
You ain't never been about all that... fall back

Niggas must want Joey to lean on 'em
Flash the binky, splash his dreams on 'em
Let 'em sleep on it, it's nothing to Crack
Lay the murder game down back to hustlin' packs
Yeah Weezy homie's got your back, whether raps or macks
Either way they both spit like BRRRRAT!
Nigga... them muhfuckas is broke like them levees
And we done sold so much dope ain't shit you tell me
Nigga... how you want it huh coke or dog food?
My shit'll have you running naked like in Old School
And yeah we 'bout it 'bout it, and you ain't ridin' on me
Unless ya got a whole fuckin' suicidal army
And I'm a rider homie, and you can find it on me
That 40 cal'll get your shirt picture ironed on it
This shit is funny to me
All these niggas wanting war but they runnin' from me... Crack!


I had 'em as lil' niggas, raised 'em 'round real niggas
Poppin' bottles fuckin' with them bitches nigga
Made money to the ceiling, me and my young nigga chilling
I'm in the streets, hustling, getting money nigga
Changed all my new shoes nigga, got some new tools
Nigga got some more jewels, we was getting money
And ain't nothing ever changed, still doing the thang
Still getting money, still spending change
We hustling from Sunday to Sunday
And we grinding everyday like the money ain't coming
Nigga... yeah we riding woodgrains and minks
Got the dope in the Hummer cold case for that thing
I hate the law for what they done did they broke in niggas cribs
Wish I woulda caught 'em Idda split they fuckin' wig

No, no, staying awake

She got a pussy like the Garden of Eden
I tip-toe through the tulips
And I'ma do me, scratch me off my to-do list
I got flies all on my new shit
Loose lips sink the cruise ship
Even gigabyte get their two chip
Havin' a pillow fight with a cute bitch
With a body like a belly dancer
She say you scared of this pussy cat, well if that's a panther
I hope it's pink, I read her mind, yeah I read every chapter
Sit on this dick, feel like you flyin' on a pterodactyl
I ain't got time to play no games
Gimme mind, don't play no games
She say she'll slit me if I'm vain, I said ""objection, sustained""
This shouldn't affect my affection
She say she sent from Heaven
That's why all flights were connected
I still use protection, if she's a blessing in disguise
But I swear it's a damn good disguise, because I can't tell
She wish she had me on lock
But there's so many other niggas doin' time
In her brain cells, damn, uh

No, no, staying awake
Am I sleepin' with the devil?
How the hell should I know
No, no, staying awake

Uh, am I sleepin' with the devil?
How the hell should I know
My heart beat echoes 'cause my insides are hallow
If anyone have a towel, wipe the guilt off my face
My high's comin' down like my stilts about to break
She tell shit I never heard when I thought I heard it all
Like you perfect but not flawless but you got the perfect flaws
And what goes around, comes around, out a swirly straw
Then she put that shit on me, I feel like some dirty draws
She say ""just don't leave me Wayne, 'cause life is short""
I say ""I'm touched but baby, pimpin' ain't a contact sport""
She dyed her hair, I asked her ""when's the funeral?""
She laughed and said ""you crazy,"" I said ""look who's talking""
And Gisselle may leave her house without makeup and still be pretty
But I wonder if I leave yo' ass, would I still be shitty?
I pour champagne on her, she put cocaine on mine
And we forget everything and six-six-six nine, alright

No, no, staying awake
How the hell should I know, am I sleepin' with the devil?
How the hell should I know
No, no, staying awake

Oh, how well do I know that I'm sleepin' with the devil
Hot pussy loosie, she be goin' at my neck
But I be shot, puttin' loosie, and I sweat when I'm around her
Regret when I'm around her
Ask me ""would I die for her?"" I say ""dead before designer""
'Cause I see through her flames and she see through my snow
She gon' be singin' the blues, hope she could hit them high notes
Pour me a drink of some few and let me spit on this ho
I told that bitch to be cool, like the temperature low
With yo' fine ass, she tell me ""gimme some more""
Like high grass but I just trim it and go, I'm on my nigga shit
I call her wifey, she call me a polygamist
And I swear that pussy taste like Devil's Food Cake
Give me a toothache, I feel like fool's gold on April Fool's Day
But I ain't a fool for love 'cause play with love, you get hurt
Play with pussy, get wet, play with fire, get burn, the roof

No, no, staying awake
Am I sleepin' with the devil? Hell if I know
No, no, staying awake

Jumping in the painted thing on them dang-a-dangs

You now I'm armed we can mash man it ain't a thing
You know I'm calm but I'm a gorilla ain't a game
I got a banana clip for all you orangutans
Let's bang!


Aye (oh!)
It's young Weezy can't none see me dawg
I get you done easy with one easy phone call
And the sawed-off make your arms fall off
Like a short sleeved polo, won't bother me no more
Ice like strobe light, look like I'm moving slow mo'
Ferrari look nice on low pro Yokohomas
With '20 inch chromes poking out 'em
Chrissy till the dome tote the ganja
Red-bone in the shower
Hello! Pocahontas give a long stroke poke for hours
Floating vagina hoe, I'mma holla
Sold coke in the '90s,  I'm honest man
Nothing big maybe ounces, grams
But I know how to double, and sometimes it's scams
But I know to hustle, and some Glocks'll jam
But I know how to bust 'em, and some drops'll slam

Momma ain't teach me no better but to get this cheddar
And that I do and for it I get at you
I consider you all fools, you niggas is hilarious
Young Money—bitches don't wanna fuck us, they wanna marry us
Now, ain't that some shit?
I can't have one bitch, but I just got one dick, and no—
I ain't fucking with the fake
I load my handgun with hand towel to touch a nigga face
I am something like a safe, I will never crack
Ain't no combination, nigga, never that
If a nigga ever said anything about Weezy and meant it
He gon' get it that same evening, pimpin'
I'm backseat riding like I'm Mr. Daisy
I am Weezy F. Baby, don't miss the Baby
I kiss the lady on her hand
I'm a fly young man, check my wingspan
This year, I probably do everything tan
Buy a crib on the sand, gotta float to the land, but
Don't get it twisted, I'll still die for me
And do a bid for my man, keep it real as I can
'Cause I'm strong, strong with a will and a plan
Where there's a will, there's a way, so make way for the fam

I bet I'll take more than one with me
I know it don't take more than one shot
And for that reason, I'm gon' shoot more than one shot (Gangsta Gri-Zillz!)
I be clicking when the gun stop, I make the body hot
Then spit on it when the body drop
I get on it like a pot of crack, I get at your bitch
Then, I tell her like a rapper: ""Holla back!""
I'm still asking, ""Where the dollars at?""
I will smash you if you got 'em Jack, I'll peel faster
The lil' bastard in the Maybach
A young nigga, I still think saving is wack
I eat, sleep, shit, and bathe with my gat
I'm like, ""Fuck pimping; slaving is back""
They like, ""Yes, master, you the best, master""
My hoes need me, I'm like test answers
You don't need me, you might catch cancer
Come back from treatment looking like Van Axel
No, I don't like baldhead hoes
I like a long-haired diva with the bossiest goals
I'm a all day pleaser, your boy can't go
He too proud, I go where your boy can't go, oh
Nasty ass lil' boy
Put my feet up on the dash, pass the  grass, enjoy
Get the coke up off the glass, get the money out the drawers
Get the weed out the jars, and we do it like stars, haha

I wake up in the morning
Take a knee and thank God
Then go to the mirror, look myself in the eye
Today I didn't wake up with a woman on my side
Yesterday I didn't wake up with a woman on my side
Neither the day before that, nor before that
I just remember the moments, call me Kodak
And know that I do miss ya
But it's your denial that I must hold against ya
Since you've been gone, I've been all alone
But alone is steroids, cuz it made me strong
Girl, hurr gone in the wind
You cheated on God's son
Baby girl, that's a sin
But I forgive you
But I can't give you
Another chance, ma, you're in my rear-view
And I put that ring on your finger
I was all in
But now it's just a symbol of what could've been

I gotta love for em that I don't show

And me and Juve never really got along
But you still would let yo nigga come get on yo hottest song
Damn, I fuck wit ya for that
I fuck with ya Lil Wack
And me and Skip go back

When you see a real nigga, you gotta tip yo hat
And since I'm a real nigga, I do just that
I had my own lawyer working on Turk's case
After I heard him dissin me on the mixtape
Cause he's locked up, and I'm free
He got a lot more to worry about than me
I ain't trippin

I remember back in the day
When an ounce of coke was four hundred
And them bitches was gay
But now these niggas is gay
And you could probably get an ounce for eight
Shit, if you spend eleven hundred you straight
And now the niggas with money is the niggas that hate
And bitches want a broke nigga cause them bitch niggas fake
But that's why me, and my hooligans debating, ho
Which one of these rich niggas we taking?
I gotta make it, Lil Layla's six now
My little brother J.E. wanna cop bricks now
And little Marley, he just hold his chick down
Get 'em a Benz so he can roll his chick round
I blow big in a 'Lac like a big dawg
I keep that sig in my lap like my dick dawg
Shit make me bust a nut in yo face
Tell ya girlfriend, ""Bitch
Wipe the slut off yo face, ho""
Where you from? I'll put you under your state
Then I go and throw a party at Bungalow 8
Yeah I'm something so straight feared I
Knock a nigga right up in his queer eye
I ain't playing nigga this is the year I must excel
Fans sending in cards say you must get well soon
Because I'm sick, so sick sick mean
I be with a cute thing
And she do her lip thing
Well as a matter fact I think you know her well
Everytime I'm with the girl you always blowing up her cell
What, would you stop me and shorty tryna chill, man
Shorty tryna feel on my eel
I shock her like Silk
I Chaka like I'm managing a Ludacris
Handling the uzi like a camera
Choose ya flick, ya strike a pose

Nasty stuff, look up! I took her
Sweet street pusher, give me that gusher
Nasty stuff, look up! I took her
Sweet street pusher, give me that gusher
Nasty stuff, look up! I took her""

Tell 'em how it go
It go; Hollygrove, Seventeen, Carrollton, Eagle Street
Runnin' with my hood 'til my feet get sore
Run up on them boys and you ain't runnin' no more
I am from the jungle, the mighty jungle
And the guns go... Hah
While your boyfriend actin' like secret service
I'mma get you by yourself and get my secret service
I'm on that purple-urple, and all the earth is bouncin'
I've climbed the highest mountain
And baby girl that coupe is fountain blue
You see them green and yellow diamonds, call it Mountain Dew
I got the crib in the sky with the city view
And I'll take a skinny bitch if her titties new
Now what it do?

""Sweet street pusher, give me that gusher
Nasty stuff, look up! I took her
Sweet street pusher, give me that gusher
Nasty stuff, look up! I took her
Sweet street pusher, give me that gusher
Nasty stuff, look up! I took her
Sweet street pusher, give me that gusher
Nasty stuff, look up! I took her""

Get 'em
OK, Gucci shoes, Gucci buckle
Gucci belt, Gucci bucket
Sharper than a yellow number two
I does in what I do
And if you didn't know, now you knew
I am the Fireman, red truck, yellow suit
And I treat money like glue
You know I got to stick to the paper, you know I'm like a staple
That's why I got that Cash Money right above my navel
Young Money is the label, money, bitches and cable
We multiplying money sitting at the time table
So holler at a nigga when you see me on the grind
And bust that pussy open like we runnin' out of time
And don't say a word, just act like a mime
The girl may be yours but the pussy is mine

""Sweet street pusher, give me that gusher
Nasty stuff, look up! I took her
Sweet street pusher, give me that gusher
Nasty stuff, look up! I took her
Sweet street pusher, give me that gusher
Nasty stuff, look up! I took her
Sweet street pusher, give me that gusher
Nasty stuff, look up! I took her""

Act a ass wit it, back ya ass with it
Act a ass wit it, back ya ass with it

You know them hoes love Weezy, say he cute, small, long hair, big dick
Weezy bring to y'all, don't y'all lip quit
Put your lips on this dick, let me get on some livin'
Spit all over ya chin, Weezy be on some pimp shit
I see 'em, peep 'em, meet 'em, beep 'em, later on if she ride
G 'em, freak 'em, by the weekend she be fuckin' the squad
I ain't got no loves for broads, I ducks and dodge
I grab 'em on their butts and all
She fucks my dog, slut sucks nuts and all, and nothin' small
This dick make 'em hit the floor and touch the wall
Call my hoes defensive linemen, cause they rush the balls
Let Weezy bust they jaws (blurrrpp)
Never have no picks and chooses, I hits and lose 'em
And go to the hotel and switch for ruggy
Like a hot, spicy, fire, project girl to thug with me
I'm so gangsta prissy chicks don't wanna fuck wit me

Titty bop, drop it like it's hot, make it fall slow
Now walk wit me, shake a leg, catch the wall ho
Ya gotta back ya ass wit, act a ass wit it
Gotta back ya ass wit, act a ass wit it
A c'mon, tear it down, catch the wall
Get naked, show me some
Tear that dick down bitch, start buggin and
And bungee jumpin'
Ya gotta back ya ass wit it, act a ass wit it
Ya gotta bend ya ass wit it, act a ass wit it

That's right, act a fool bitch, do what you do, ho
After I finish, don't get up, gotta let Weezy go
You get your props your pussy fire, girl you a pro
So when I'm speakin' I'm creepin' and come get some mo'
You better recognize, you better realize
This is the nigga Geezy, I ain't nothin' nice
Love when you reach out, grab, stuff it straight your mouth
Start suckin 'til that middle come out
Ride me (ride me), put that dick inside you (inside you)
After that wiggle your ass gimmie that loose-loose
I'm a donkey, better yet a veteran
At the same time I can fuck you and your best friend
The Number 1 Stunna, Baby he raised me
Pumped in my head - never let a bitch play me
Always get the clique, make you fuck 'em all
Wrap a chain 'round ya neck and walk it like a dog

Titty bop, drop it like it's hot, make it fall slow
Now walk wit me, shake a leg, catch the wall ho
Ya gotta back ya ass wit, act a ass wit it
Gotta back ya ass wit, act a ass wit it
A c'mon, tear it down, catch the wall
Get naked, show me some
Tear that dick down bitch, start buggin and
And bungee jumpin'
Ya gotta back ya ass wit it, act a ass wit it
Ya gotta bend ya ass wit it, act a ass wit it

See me, Lil Wayne I put that dick down, biznites can't even walk, can't even sit down
Wipe your mouth off and let me hit now
That Rum got me feelin' real good
The dick hard like real wood
I put it in slow and work it real good
This Lil nigga have a lot a sex, so do me slow, get out the Prada dress
I Come when you wanted to like private jets
I'm on blast ma', why you take it slower than its fast time
Flip ya back over, make that ass right
Weezy make ya suck it then taste, that's how the pimp play
Make her friend eat me and this bitch up like shrimp plates
Bouncing in the club rollin' on X, eyes pitch black
I got 2 more 'nites is you wit that
Fuck it let's go, we pop a bottle of the Moe'
Drop the top part of the 'Dro
Later on I'm touchin' the throat, bad wit it
Where them hot girls that like that nasty shit
Make them act a ass wit it, back ya ass wit it

Titty bop, drop it like it's hot, make it fall slow
Now walk wit me, shake a leg, catch the wall ho
Ya gotta back ya ass wit, act a ass wit it
Gotta back ya ass wit, act a ass wit it
A c'mon, tear it down, catch the wall

YM Banger,I Am Not a Human Being,2010.0,"Ok I'm leanin' to the left, flag in my right pocket
Star Trek fly, unidentified flying objects
Extraterrestrial, I'm all about my decimals
Retarded in the booth, they say I got a special flow
Sicker than your average you rappers is ass backwards
Gudda spit crack and you niggas is crack addicts
It's simple mathematics; you cut the check
And I rake in the green like I'm rakin' the grass in
Pretty bitches damn near faint when they passin'
Call my whip Martin, but the first name Aston
Potatohead niggas get mashed when I'm spazzin
Think you fuckin' with me? Put your cash in
Nah, I doubt it;
I was young and reckless when P say he was about it
You niggas is Ducks, Howards, Cowards
Kill the competition and shower niggas with flowers
This rap shit is ours, Gudda, bitch~!

Uh, Uptown back in it, Hollygrove black menace
Black clothes, black tennis', black semi'
I've never sat in the Hemi, that will offend me
Try Maybach or Maybach, bitch I got stacks
Yeah, 
Paychecks on paychecks and I still want payback
I still don't play that, I kill on ASAP
And we don't do shit but get money all day
Put some shoes on my bullets now they runnin' your way
YM, Young Mula, Young Money all day
Where the drugs so sweet like honey on yay
Which one of y'all say you want drama? I'm honored
I blitz yo' ass like a mothafuckin' lineman
Stack of paychecks with a whole bunch of commas
Still wear red like an old 49er
Fuck shittin' on ya, dump the whole toilet on ya
Weezy F baby, bitch I'm hotter than Uganda
Uggh!

Let-let go
Mo-momma ain't make me to make homies, she made me to make history
So doin that my extra-curicular activity
Bulldozer boy and my target is the industry
Two things in the world I love - good head and victory
You ain't doin' it big, I'm grown, stop kiddin me
Your whip ain't up to date and your hoes look like Mr. T
This is Misery, no Kathy Bates
Come at me sideways my money'll slap you straight
Yeah, I'm a big joker so you know I'll smash your ace
Leave the club with ya girl send her home with a ashy face
Love is a gamble, but it's my casino
And tonight you're the loser, I hope she got Aveno
I hope the game got life insurance cause I'mma kill it
And all you whack ass rap niggas dyin with it
I'm so Harlem, eatin but still starvin'
Po-pockets fat as fuck like all they do is eat margarine
Millz!

Say, put the flow
Say, put the flow in the pot, crank up the notch
Burn the song from a stove top, this finger lickin hot
His pick flip cause the nigga flopped
My shit hit like the pitch was soft, niggas cottonballed
She dropped drawers cause she poppin off
Her pussy crossed guard but, I don't stop at all
I smash in the car, like fuck the fuckin law
Her baby daddy gone, who wanna meet the Don?
That Rocky shit up on the arm-arm
Shittin on 'em like hay in the barn
Hey wait they say Money talks and, man you don't speak at all
You shop at mini-malls
My style two thumbs up like using analogs
Ha ha~! I wreck shit for the recognition bitch
Jesus as my witness, Saan vision
Eyeball you niggas, flame flicker

They label me a problem and I probably am so I dont knock em
I pop up in a broccoli Lam' on choppers
With an ol' school bitch, she got on door knockers
And she knock on your door for that raw partner
Hollygrove Wayne, that boy a monster
Jacked for a Mazda come back in Mase-rati
Like how he? Why he? Cause I be
Moving through the city like an I.V
Tryna be monogamous but I got bitches on my dick
Like I'm the shit cause I'm the shit
So I only promise this: to my little girl I will give you the world
And to my unborn I'm tryna reason with ya moms so
If I'm not with her when you get here, its already clear
Yeah, and for their sake I'm a ball every year
I'm a pause every tear
And tattoo it on my face
Niggas know, that I got that black music on my waist
Make me put it to your ear and get that b-b-b-b-bass
Bluka bluka to ya face, closed casket
Mama can't remember shit but last saturday, what a tragedy
Flowers for the family
Powder in my nap sack
Running through the projects, tryna get a stack back
I got my SK bout to get my MAC back to pap pap at niggas who yap yap
Yup yup! and I rep that 17 hard, you know
'til a nigga ain't nothing but tomb quotes
Raw Tune, who you know go harder than dude
See these is the clues, part of my shoes
I bleed with them dudes I'm part of the crew
Don't move cause you right in the route of the gun mouth
When it talk, you know what come out- barreltone
Nigga y-y-young Wayne from out Carrollton
Yeah, I got my eyes on the sparrow
Though my path is narrow, my angels are shadows
I saddled up, and get the fucking battle
Automatics up, like nigga fuck whoever
You touch and reach, you get fucking bleached
Above the law niggas put you underneath
You call the law nigga? You fucking leech!
You Saved by the Bell, you fucking Screech
My bucket screech through the streets like a R&B singer
You ain't pimping until you fuck a R&B singer
I walked in this building with all these bangers
And all these niggas look like targets to me
What's a drought to you may be a bargain to me
Cause I just may be sitting on a carton of Ki's
I got important people thats trying to market me
So I'm gon' stop talking 'bout the white, Sike!
I know I'm not walking without a fight
So I'm swinging with all my might
We can go all night
I'm a blow all day, and I'm a blow all night
Do a verse today and do a show tonight!
Fuck a ho today, and fuck a ho tonight!
Im' a live my life like there's no tonight
I might go tonight so mama pray don't cry
Cause your prayers maybe working, mama they gon' try
Yeah,and we rock to the same lullaby
Nigga I got 10, nigga I got 5

With them light brown we in the back seat
Shawty body shaped like a figure eight
Yeah that pussy great
She bout to get ate

It was a Friday
I was on the highway
Riding to that Kanye
That's when I saw a bad bitch ridin right behind me
And I slowed down so she can be beside me
Like beep beep Shawty you sweet shawty Best pullover in me shawty
Gas station that's on me
And you know that ain't cheap shawty
You deserve 93 shawty
You deserve me shawty
So tell that other nigga
He can leave like a tree falling
And when it comes to love Baby I'm free falling
Did I leave my eyes In yo pussy cause I see me all in, it
And I put her to bed
And know she sleep walking
And she never answer her phone
Not even if E.T. calling
Man you should see darlin
She like a sea dolphin
Splash splash shout out bird gang
She balling
And I just try to be her
Tol ya somethin
Cop' her 20 hand bags
Out of coach or something
First class flight
Get her out of coach o something
How bout vacation
Round my by bon voyage
And With no snowtra something
Yeah
And tell yo man he don't
Owe me nothing
Tell him open his eyes I gotta show him something
Uh
I started riding
Like a dirty dozen
Uh
Have a feeling like she Oprah cousin haha
But fuck money
I give her mostly loving
Then I'm gone before it's sunny


It's next Friday
I'm on the high way
Ridin to that Sade`
I se a bad bitch up in a Hyundai
I said ""baby you supposed to be up in my place""
She started laughin
I got the joke late
Look I just want ta tie u down with this rope braid
Lil mama so cold
I call her Snowflake
I fuck her so good on that coldplay
Now what you kno bout it
What you know about it
It ain't what you know about it's how you go about it
An I go about it like I kno about it
Like I'm sho about it
Like I'm so about it
Baby I can take you
Farther than your fantasy
Maybe one day I can be the father of your family
I can handle all the extremities
She remember me ohww

Oh! 
Ohhh

Oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

I've been lonely, I've been waiting for you
I'm pretending, and that's all I can do
(That's all I can do mama) the love I'm sending
Ain't making it through to your heart...
(I hope you hear me)
(Lil Wayne)
Since I've lost you I'm lost too
Nigga feeling like he at the bottom like a horse shoe
Sorry for the trouble that I put you in your heart too
God knows that I'll do anything for a part 2
Ought to, be praying for the day you come back to me
Sayin that you forgive me
Give me another chance I'm needing it like a kidney
I don't want an advance
Give me back her hands give me back her touch
I don't ask for much, but I fucked up
I know I fucked up, I admit I fucked up, but everybody fucks up
Now this southern nigga locked up
Telling me and my click don't give a fuck
Cause I'm from new Orleans, she was from Georgia
She was my down chick, I was a soldier
I was a gangsta, she was my shoulder
You were the pistol to my holster, bang!

Up in the living room watchin sports center
You were cookin dinner, I was such a sinner
But the lord is a forgiver
You know they say if u pray then u can get your blessings ordered and delivered
And your boyfriend is not like me
Why you even go and get a like me
I remember we would sit at home all day
You called me butter, I called you babe
My momma asked about you, my partners did too
I know your daughter will be so amazing like you
And I know you probably wish you never met me
And I just wish you never forget me
And let me say, please, don't worry about the women I have been with
No engagement can amount to your friendship
And I hope that nigga know he got a queen
And all I can do is dream. Damn

I shed tears 'cause I'm told that they'll heal
To tell the truth I don't know how to feel
Ever felt alone in a room full of friends
Got big plans but you leave 'em in suspense
Pray for me, patience wait for me
Pay dues, trust me they ain't comin
Way back it was hoops, now it's Maybach coupes
And we all took a vow, no squares in the loops
Now we lookin at each other, sittin in a court room
I'm laughin, cause it's lookin like a cartoon
Never snitch, got it tattood by kartoo?
(somebody switch) by my rules we all lose
(Lil Wayne)
You forgot about the house, you forgot about the ring
I remember everything, I just wanna hear you sing
I remember the love right after the fight
You can't tell me you don't remember those nights
And if I would cry, you would cry twice
To me you were the brightest star under sunlight
Take away my title, take away my stripes
And give me back my girl and you give me back my life
-Give me back my girl and you give me back my life-
See this is just a nightmare so I blink twice
Open up my eyes hoping she'd be in my sight
I remember the time I wish I could bring it back
What she means to me is what I mean to rap

But they keep takin pictures of my jewels in the light
Hundred g's in the night, entertain big timers
Cause my 1 liners rule these dynamers
Smellin rosé on my breath, on ex brisco fell asleep in his bed
Habits we developed livin lavish stackin mail up
Clothes come from big n tall …………?
Got live life, I'm tryna live life
Penthouse for a pimp, only drove the Benz twice
Convertible to the cars, cause I murdered all of ours
Get 50 collect calls from dawgs behind bars

Fortune n fame are pleasures you couldn't fathom
But fortunately for me my fortune built me a palace
Benjamins by the pallet, I'm spendin 'em mighty daily
I know I'm under surveillance ( I look at it as a talent)
Millions a gotta manage, lil talents up in the rappin I'm such a threat to these n*ggaz (you never know what could happen)
I started without a coin, not knowin which way I'm goin
Now I'm chatering boeings n readin a few poems
Weathered all of the storms, now its time to see the light
And I never felt this way about anything in my life
Determined to be the best, not lookin back at regrets
How many people you blessed is how you measure success

Money ain't shit cause my Rottweilers drink Moët
Diamond baguette bracelets for my lovers
Player, I use Cristal to lubricate rubbers
Who got shit on his wrist that cost three nickel
Who got the project on lock when that nigga slanging pickle
Who got a Benz, a Prowler, playboy, and a 'Vette
Tell the truth -- who fucked you on the same night when we met?
Now, who got baby mamas from the N.O. to New York
Who got every bitch's attention in this motherfucker when he talk
Now who the fuck we talking about, look -- y'all dont know?
I'll give you a hint: see that bitch you with?
He fucked that ho
Now look here, y'all ain't seen my watch, it's like 'Harlem World' video
White diamonds, red rubies, blue baugettes, I don't know
Shorty, when the next time I'mma be up in your bed
I love you? You love me?
Well go 'head on and gimme some head

Loud pipes big rims
Wodie that's our life
When we pull up at the club
Sorry that's our night
I know a lot of haters out there saying
That that's not right
But our diamonds are much bigger
So that's our life

Wodie that's our life
When we pull up at the club
Sorry that's our night
I know a lot of haters out there saying
That that's not right
But our diamonds are much bigger
So that's our life

I told 'Soul' I need something
With some hell of a ice
Nigga came back with a hell of a price
That ain't nothing, these hoes doing hella wrong
Calling these niggas on our cell phone
Bitch riding Benz on 20-inch chrome
Give me the key, the car, ho, and the alarm
For my Prowler, my Jag, my Benz and my home
Bitch you'll never ride 20-inch chrome
I love to shine, that's why the chopper's mine
Hit my block in my Benz, ho, with stretch tires
Bought a new car that I couldn't drive
Bought it to tunes before a nigga could drive
When I put the Bose system right behind my eyes
With the VC's and TV's so a nigga could shine
Let my ice bling bling like a 9 to 5
And tell all my hoes they don't need no job

Loud pipes big rims
Wodie that's our life
When we pull up at the club
Sorry that's our night
I know a lot of haters out there saying
That that's not right
But our diamonds are much bigger
So that's our life
Loud pipes big rims
Wodie that's our life
When we pull up at the club
Sorry that's our night
I know a lot of haters out there saying
That that's not right
But our diamonds are much bigger
So that's our life

I ride the best, from a Benz, to a Jag, to a Beamer, to a Lex
Might fly first class on Delta, helicopter or a jet
I'm a stunter, I'm a repper, Geezy like to shine
Drink Don, Moët, and Crissy, see that's the finest wine
20 inches is the only thing I sit my shit on
Don't bring yo bitch around me cause my dick she'll wanna sit on
And I ain't gonna tell her nothing different, that's your issue
But after she come back, your best out is not to kiss her
Whole city sayin damn, look at Fresh pinky ring
Look at B.G. watch, that bitch bling-a-ling-a-ling
I'm a ice wearer, trust me, you will never
See me sporting nothing that ain't 20 G's or better
Me and Wayne take the left, Juve and Baby take the right
It's dark in the room, we hold up our watches and it's light
Cash Money Millionaires living a hell of a life
Like my nigga Weezy said, we surrounded by ice

Loud pipes big rims
Wodie that's our life
When we pull up at the club
Sorry that's our night
I know a lot of haters out there saying
That that's not right
But our diamonds are much bigger
So that's our life
Loud pipes big rims
Wodie that's our life
When we pull up at the club
Sorry that's our night
I know a lot of haters out there saying
That that's not right
But our diamonds are much bigger
So that's our life

Whoa, whoa, whoa
Now I'm shinin' beamin' glossin', Big Tymin' stuntin' and flossin'
Lamborghini sitting on broaders with two more in my garages
Plus a blue and black ferrari 
with Nintendo and Atari
Man I swear the car is awesome, vroom! Sorry, we lost 'em
I'm back, I pull up smelling like dime sacks and cognac
I leave in the Hummer, hour later I'm flying back
Whoosh, private jet's about to land
The women fall out when I let them touch my hand
I get out the plane into a Mercedes Benz van
TVs all over with chrome 20-inch fans, damn
Goddamn, man, I am, L-I-L, Weezy, off the heezy
But still in awe, ice floodin' on my watch
And in my grill and all, Porsche Box', front blocks
Skrrt! Peeling off, me and Slim in the Rover
Beatrice brick holder, Cash Money young soldier

Loud pipes big rims
Wodie that's our life
When we pull up at the club
Sorry that's our night
I know a lot of haters out there saying
That that's not right
But our diamonds are much bigger
So that's our life
Loud pipes big rims
Wodie that's our life
When we pull up at the club
Sorry that's our night
I know a lot of haters out there saying
That that's not right
But our diamonds are much bigger
So that's our life",https://genius.com/Lil-wayne-loud-pipes-lyrics
So Gone,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Shut Up!

Who am I, I'm doing mine
Gave me the chance; I won't letcha go
I wanna be more than just sexual
But every time I'm so gone
Gone -on -on , soo gone
Cause you gone, it's forever now

Young Mula Baby
I'm a blood, I'm a pro, I'm a G
In a different world, outerspace with a freak
But that don't mean Neptune on the beat
Cause its Nu Jerzey Devil from Black Wall Street
Weezy F baby from Young Money baby
Like the Easter bunny, baby wanted my candy
So I gave her my lollipop then she made her body pop
Then that made me kinda hot
I'm lying that made me sauna hot
But please stop sweatin on me, women scream ""get in me""
And what do I do I get in 'em , I put on my boots and I step in 'em
Right left in em Mr. Excedrin
Head all the time, it may sound crazy but I got head on my mind
Lay it on the line or just lay on young Carter!
And yeah I hear you screaming but my name ain't harder!
Girl I'm nasty I do my thing and have you calling for me like Lassie


I'mma flirt man I really don't care
I tell the women whatever they wann hear
Mommy I'm balling I'm so sincere
Is that your home girl sitting right there
She can be my monday
You can be my tuesday
After shorty done I can squeeze ya'll in today
Three is not a crowd I don't care what you say
My women come in twos like shoes with a cute face!
My girl gotta girlfriend, her girl gotta girlfriend
Bring her to the crib I'm a show you how I work it
Little man in the boat here come the serpeants
Slide your body down the pole and let me see you twerk it
I'm with my thursday junk she a real freak
A hundred grand fitting right up in her butt cheek
Mrs friday go easy cause she just learnin
But saturday be having mr devil's toes curlin",https://genius.com/Lil-wayne-so-gone-lyrics
Never Get It,The Leak 4,UnKnown,"Hat to the front
Lookin' like I'm lightin' up a bat for a blunt
I'm stickin' to the script, tryna kick it like a punt
My life is like a movie and I do my own stunts
I'm the Birdman Jr.,
 call me young Baby
Coulda been a killer but Cash Money saved me
Remember I was little but the cash money made me
Big dog bitch, no tramp, no lady
Young ass nigga had a thing for old ladies
But as I got older I began to like 'em younger
To heavens where I brung her, 
My wing she was under
She said ""Daddy they, daddy they, daddy they, daddy they
Daddy they can't do it like you can""
I get chips like Vegas and I am not blue man
Too much ice on my wrist and now I got a blue hand
And if I sing Prostitute she gon' need some new pants
And if I sing Pussy Monster she gon' need a new man
Hello world, I would you all to meet me, her new man
I vow to stay on top of my Somers like Suzanne
And I hustle everyday, everyday, everyday, everyday
Everyday I'm hustlin', fillin' up my cup again
Wit that purple stuff again, I can't get enough of it
Point me in the direction of a swisher and I'm stuffin' it
With that purple stuff again, I'm on some same color shit
After you do Wayne, it's time to do Wayne's brothers bitch
I get money like a fuckin' Wayans brother bitch
I get good with Gorillas and stay away from the rattlesnakes
And the jakes, and the fake, and the hate
Interstate 10, no cops in sight
And I'm coming back with a whole flock tonight
Lord, don't let me get stopped tonight
Or I'mma have to shoot it out with the cops tonight
I swear, and tell the jack boys not tonight
Cause I ain't 'N Sync, but I will Pop tonight
Yeah, that's right, if you ain't got that price
Then go thataway, not a way we can even negotiate
Big money heavyweight, on my way to Heaven's Gate
So if that be them open gates, flow so appropriate
Don't associate me with the bullshit
One wish, I wish a motherfucker would trip
Like a engine, I come from under the hood bitch
But now a nigga gettin' paper like a booklet
They ain't help me with it, but I took it
And now they never get it, never get it, never get it, never get it
Never get it back, yeah that's my word
""Bling-Bling"" in the dictionary, yeah that's my word
And for me Ja Rule made it just like Irv
Sometimes I still go through the hood just to kiss my curb
Cause I love that block nigga, Eagle and Apple
Old G's, young G's, leaders and barrels
But God found me like a needle in a barrel
And I'm so ready for war cause I'm a Jesus for the battle
Money on my mind, that's all I think of
Married to the game, never takin my ring off
M.O.B., yeah that's my theme song
Smokin' two L's, rockin' bells like ding-dong
Haha, yeah I got my wings on
Flyer than the rest, I don't rest I keep goin
I just I-G-nore 'em
Like anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway
Anyway it goes, I'mma get gold
And I could see the top, the way I'm climbin this pole
A nigga with the flu ain't rhyming this cold
And nigga I'm hotter than a ""fire in the hole""
Steppin' out my shower like a lion in a robe
Eyin' these hoes, iron in my hol-ster
Surp, purp, sure
Let's elevate and get away, accelerate and never hate
Dedicate this, to the blue eyes and blonde hair
I'm on top of my green like a lawn chair
Don't worry, I'm straight like arm hair
Don't worry, I'm straight like combed hair
This world fucked my Pops and I was born here
From the cell to a jet, call it Con-Air
I told my niggas that we would see
Better days yesterday, and today is a better day

Oh yes I love her like... egyptian
Want a description? her body's sickenin
I can be her prescription, I can be her physician
Sexual healing, I can be her religion
And now shes kneeling, praying to the ceiling
I bless her as if she sneezed
Must be the weather, I dress her, I am her sleeves
I am her feathers, shes fly
Flyer than you, flyer than me
I love her, she loves me too
I love her three... times more than her mom
Time will tell that I'm the nigga
That she should, we should
Be wherever she wanna be
Be on her late night, mid day, AM
Just say when and I know I be with cavemen
But never... mind them
Shes poison and I am Michael Bivins
See I know y'all don't hear me
But she does, we does
What grown folk do when they had too much to drink
And I think, we had to much too drink and...
(Oh yes I love her like...)
Pussy, Money, Weed, Pussy, Money, Weed, Pussy, Money, Weed
Oh yes I love her like I ought too
I see you at the alter mrs. carter
I see you with my daughter
Or son, more than one
Maybe five like the jacksons
Or john pacson
Just don't let them f*ck up the mansion
And daddy will be home later on
Smelling like the cologne
That I put on this morn
And I hope that you smell like woman soap
And shampoo and lotion
And perfume and candles
And I'm a run thru that pussy like a vandal
Yes I'm nasty as a Scorpio
But I'm a lucky Libra
Got her wet like shes sweating out a fever
Leave her to me and she'll be smiling
Every single time you see her
From ear to ear
I wanna be beside her when she sleep and she lay
Or we can stay awake and watch the next day
Clothes are overrated, panties are debated
Einstein... her head is the greatest
(Oh yes I love her like...)
Pussy, Money, Weed, Pussy, Money, Weed, Pussy, Money, Weed
Oh yes I love her like her dad told her
No man would ever love her
Oh and I better be the only man
Sticking it, licking it like an envelope
Mailing it, sealing it, read it
I have written down victoria's secret
Don't tell nobody, don't share your body
With nobody, not even a finger
I will cut it off and let him keep
That as for weezy, baby
And at my station we have sex orientation
When I hit it she squint like them orient asians
I do me, I say hey miss chung lee
I like to see your booty
Roll like sushi, I'm tryin to dip my celery
Up in her blue cheese
Ah's, oo wee's, wa la's, ta da's
Mhm's, ah ha's, oh yes, never oh no's
Until I have to go, and then it's never oh no
I tell her don't cry, I be back like the electric bill
And when she butt naked she dress to kill!

And if the weed man ain't got no more 
onions I'm a cry
And if if was a fifth, then I'd rather drink wine

Shit... I'm a take my time
Now am I crazy or just lazy
Cause I'm tired of ballin darlin
And I roll with my riders like it's a harley bar
And we roll with them choppers like it's a harley party

I was ballin in New Orleans way before the charolette hornets
I'm an X-Man bitch and I ain't talkin marvel comics

Ay, let me slide in the Benz with the fished-out fins
Hit the mall wit my girlfriends, dish out ends
Cause you know it ain't trickin if you got it
Copped baby girl what she desired
It's chump change ma, marijuana scholar
Know'n what I got up in my styrofoam cup - that purple stuff
It was given to me at birth to stunt
So that's why I cop the Bentley with the leather and the furry cups

Hey, hold on mami them whips on dubs
Cadillac Truck, 28's, no rubs
Slide in the Benz, fins, bubble-eyed lens
Car show in New York, y'all know who wins
It's the Birdman daddy, with the Gucci Prada
Slant back Cup Truck, no rims - can't holla
It's that Louie Fendi on Ostrich streets
It's the tailor-made daddy, mami do you love me?

Baby, I'm a stunna
I ain't gon change it
Don't.. you.. know.. it's a way of life?
Mami, do you want it?
Cause I'm about to bring it
Oh baby, can't stop the stun, no, no

Pop one, pop two with the new Nike shoes
Royal blue jag on 'em 22's
Slippers, white to breate, 500 Degreez
In that Cadillac Truck on 'em 23's
I'm the boss of the game with the money and fame
All these, naked women that pop champagne
And these, marble floors stay high as Rick James
If you know my name then you know my game

It's lil whoadie from the hot block with serious flow
Gotta get dough, cha'll won't feel me broke
But, y'all don't hear me though
Til I'm rolling down my window where my grill is show
And you know I probably pump it through the hood on them 24's
Word, rims poking out the side of the err
Glock, have ya ribs poking out the side of your shirt
I'm a 17 nigga and I ride through the turf

Baby, I'm a stunna
I ain't gon change it
Don't.. you.. know.. it's a way of life?
Mami, do you want it?
Cause I'm about to bring it
Oh baby, can't stop the stun, no, no

Hey, and my pinky glow cause my rings is so...
Blingy blingy, yo stop blinking though
We smoke stinky stinky dro
And we don't cop them incy wincy o's
And we don't stop, nah, we blow
Fuck the pee-ple
Everywhere we go we smell like ick yo
Birdman, my Paw so that make me go.. fly like an eagle, fasheezy

See they think cause I stay English turn
That stunna don't ever OZ to burn
I go in each over and ball like a dog
Me and my niggs ball like a dog
Cars on my streets, all on the lawn
Ice in my teeth, all on my arm
Tats in my face, my back and my arm

Tats in my face, my back and my arm

Mami, do you want it?

Oh baby, can't stop the stun, no, no

Yo, there it is, ya lil' low life
See, I'm a Bro-fessional - you a rookie
Fuck, a game so serious I could sell a hooker some pussy
That's some serious shit
Oh yeah, believe that

Apology for Stepping on the American Flag,UnKnown,UnKnown,"""I didn't step on the flag on purpose! It's a scene in a video where the flag drops behind me and after it drop it's just there as I perform""

""It was never my intention to desecrate the flag of the United States of America. I was shooting a video for a song off my album entitled ""God Bless Amerika"". The clip that surfaced on the Internet was a camera trick clip that revealed that behind the American Flag was the Hoods of America. In the final edit of the video you will see the flag fall to reveal what is behind it but will never see it on the ground. In most people eyes including my own who were raised in that environment, the Hood is the only America they know and the only America I knew growing up. I was fortunate from my God given talents to escape the Hood and see the other beautiful places this country has to offer but most people who are born in that environment don't get that chance. That's their view of their America. That was Dwayne M Carter from Hollygrove New Orleans view of America. That's who I'm speaking for in this song"".",https://genius.com/Lil-wayne-apology-for-stepping-on-the-american-flag-annotated
Ain’t Got Time,The W. Carter Collection,UnKnown,"Rolling stocky, kinda brocky on the streets where niggas watch me
If you plotting I'mma prol'ly get to pop at your noggin
I'm a Hollygrove problem, like ""Follow me yeah
Come and be my death volunteer,""
That's why I'm here, I come to get that scratch
I done been to jail twice and tell them crackers I ain't never going back, huh?
Rode through the city with the metal on my back, huh?
Gave me a shot and I sent several of 'em back, huh?
Gave me some money, they won't ever get it back now
One million, two million, three million: I'm stacked now
No more crack now, it's in the back for now
Just in case she crack down
I never back down, shit bitch, I might react now
But, 4 million, 5 million, 6 million: I'm that now
Where you at clown? I'm high in the sky
You at ground, so set down you bitch you

Money on my mind, pistol on my side
I make a nigga hide that pride
I ain't got time for you bitches, I'm trying get these riches
Real niggas know that vision
I ain't time for you haters, I'm trying get this paper
Real ladies know that labor
I ain't got time for you snitches, I'm trying get them riches
Real niggas know that vision

You motherfuckers know what I'm out here doing
And you ain't gotta buy it, if you not into it
Dope block influenced, blue pale light, scream
I'm on that same ass block letting the bell ring
Looking for the boy, the one in the back
I could get your stomach out of your back
I could make you shit better, this better, than what them selling
They need drugs no penicillin and I'm the medicine man
Yes I am him, yup-yup
Hip-hip, hoo-ray, 20 hard came today
And two large was the pay, and the Coast Guard said it was okay
Bring them barge to the bay
And my bitch looks like a DeBarge so I call her bait
She put packs in her bra, and the keys in the case
If she ever try to skate with the cake, and relocate
I got her social and her birth date, bitch please


I talk like a hustler, walk like a hustler
Stripper attitude, only money make me move
Dapper dan status, I'm the stunner part two
I got an image to uphold, and my image do, too
I'm off the scrimmage line like Emmitt 2-2
Why would the quarterback give it to you?
I gotta hundred sacks, and a hundred women; French twist
And we don't even talk, we just French kiss, I could never get pinched
I'm rocking like a big pimp
Momma only dated hustlers, so I could only commend them
And never roll with a dummy on your hip
Have the judge giving you a run-on sentence
Never that, I keep the gun on for that business
And when I'm not, I'm at business
See that's that, mad business, peep the simplistics

She know that it's ""bye"" after I'm through then it's another girl
I can make your wife and your sister fuck your brother girl
Rockstar biatch, 
check out how we rock
And if this ain't hip-hop, it must be knee-hop
I'm higher than a motherfucking chronic leaf treetop
I make that Nina sing like, ""Shooty-do-dee-wop""
You want the facts, Daddy? Well I truly do me, Pop
And I get my candy from your girlfriend's sweet shop
Still get a stomachache every time I see cops
You better run motherfucker, 'cause we not
Yeah, you bitches better run 'til your feet stop
And I'm so fed up with street cops
I'm colder than a ski shop, I'm holding onto the top
And even if I let go, I still won't d-rop

I am the rhyming Oasis
I got a cup of your time, I won't waste it
I got my foot on the line, I'm not racing
I thank God that I am not basic

I am not a human being

Hahaha! Rockstar, baby
Now come to my suite and get lockjaw, baby
I can knock your boots and your socks off, baby
Newsflash: your boyfriend a knockoff, baby
Okay, real shit: you can get knocked off, baby

Staring at a mountain like, ""Bitch, I will climb you""
I stand tall like I'm motherfucking 9'2""

This the School of Hard Rock, I'm a rockstar grad
And my kids are proud to have a rockstar dad

Don't jump into my water 'cause you not gon' last

I was dead wrong, I deserved to get out
But you just talked it over with my mom and got it situated in due time
Told me get the paper instead of high
So now I take that advice and shed light over my whole life dog
I wanted to be just like you my whole life dog
I can't believe them niggas stole ya, that shit's pain to me
But don't trip, I hold you down, you still remain through me

I promise I won't ever put nothin above you dog
So I live my life in dedication of you dog
I know you see me happy on the outside and hurt within
Make me wanna grab that gun and burst again
But I know they got a reason why I'm here
And I know they got a reason why you gone
And therefore, I'm succeedin on my own
But you ain't never left me, nigga, you still dwell in my heart
I can't forget you kept it real from the start
And until my last breath I exhale, I'm a keep you with me
And when we do meet again, I'm a keep you with me

Bullet find a home in ya arteries, pardon me
But them niggas won't touch not a part of me, bet on it
Them niggas belong in a sorority, ain't that a bitch
Burn they bodies up for the authorities, no evidence
You gone stop fuckin' with them warriors from New Orleans
And, I really think that it'd be better if
I just hit your block with that beretta and hop out and let her rip
Let her bang, let her bust, etcetera, etcetera
You niggas is scared of the, southern part of America
Here it come, got a gun, never come without one
Niggas wanna ball, so I guess I gotta bounce 'em
Smokin' on an ounce of that shit from the mountains
People say I need to stop, no I need a counselor
And down here you are gonna need a chopper
And I'mma need a lawyer, and you gon' need a doctor (Why? Because...)


Get at em we hit 'em up if they rattin'
Niggas ain't fuckin' with the boy them niggas softer than satin
I'm feeling awful and aggy, yes I walk with the maggy
I tell him park in a alley, and leave 'em parked in the alley
Niggas talking about me, but they ain't talking it at me
Cause if they talkin' it at me, then I'm just talking to caskets
All that talking is pussy bitch you better make ya words strong
Cause the shit gettin' chiseled on ya tombstone
What they do I got a chopper in the UHaul
Make a real nigga bring it back to '92 dog
Bring his ass to the river drop the fool off
Hope he can swim with them concrete shoes on
I got the gun right beside me who don't
Got beef homie I was just getting hungry
When you come bitch you better bring an army
We can do it in the streets and throw a gansgta party nigga (Why? Because...)


Thirty shots in the clip, nigga let's trip
Line 'em up, put 'em down on the guest list
These niggas 'bout to make me go Rambo
I'mma take the shit as far as it can go
War is the answer if ya questioning the general
Snap shots at you baby you are just a centerfold
And less Kenny Cole, niggas seem plenty bold
Pull that bitch out alright don't make me get my fishin' pole
Them niggas hoes, really doe
I would swing down there with any O, Forty-Fo' and let 'em go
Let 'em know, that I ain't never been sweet and won't be
Yes I'll be right here on the ground when you want me
Make a nigga have to come back like Rufus Mack

She got that shit I just can't avoid
She so addictive
And she know that I do anything that she tell me
I am her personal sex toy
And then, 
I pop the bottle of that Cris
I had a glass, she had a glass
I had a glass, she had a glass again
Ya know, then she was ready, got to it
One time, two times, hit me up and I tap that ass again

Say girl...
I see ya walkin like the cameras on ya
I love ya backshots
I'm like a crackhead, and you got your crack out
See, we got chemistry baby, we like cat and mouse

Pin ya to the wall, give ya couple of back bites
Give ya couple of thigh bites
Then here comes the highlight
I could make ya act rrright
Take a ten minute break, then get back right

Yeah, I told her
Ya mama gotta be a model, or sum'n
And if you was a wine bottle, I'm drunk

Shyeah, I ain't lyin girl
I could make ya little pussy start cryin girl
You on fire, girl
You know the fireman could put out the fire, girl
Are those applebottom jeans ya wearin?
She said these is Donna Karen
So tight, she can't even let air in
Man, I swear, I saw a blind man starin
No lie, and I hope she take her clothes off

And she was a beast
Woman so bad, it's illegal to speak
She say she like me and she was eager to meet
And I was just as eager as eager as she
Body so sick you can eat off her feet
Go to the hospital, die in a week
She say she was a model, well obviously
'Cause I can sure picture her between my sheets
Baby was a flower with rose pedal cheeks
And every time she talk it's like a gold medal speech
Intelligent, she should teach
And if so
I will be a nerd like screech

I told her I would write a rhyme about her and it would be sweet
I said I need the perfect track, she said, ""That's deep""
I worked on it all night didn't get no sleep

She said her name was Lisa Marie and she was discreet
Her picture's in the dictionary next to elite
I told her we can get away we can retreat
Cut off my arms put 'em on her seat
Cut off my legs put 'em on her head
So I could run through her mind like she does mine
And every time she smile it make me feel like a child
In the supermarket on the candy aisle
I saw a picture of her with her panties down
I fall asleep and dream, I'm a camera now
I would love to be the water in her shower
Or one of her bath towels

I told her I would write a rhyme about her and it would be sweet
I said I need the perfect track, she said, ""That's deep""

She was unique, exquisite
Like x y z, she was complete
And I think she like butterflies
Because she got one on her upper thigh
And her face is like summertime
Birthday the same month as mine with a different sign
Virgo, I go wherever her go
If she say so I'm on her like a fur coat
In November, she colder than December
She got me fallin' like timber

I told her I would write a rhyme about her and it would be sweet
I said I need the perfect track, she said, ""That's deep""

See that's why I need to start growing my own weed

If you sober, don't judge me, leave it up to the jury
Smoke medicinal weed like I'm tryna cure shit
And I feel better than alligators with pure skin
She roll my weed for me, hold my weed for me
She hold that shit, them other bitches got weak stomachs
I don't smoke hookah, I don't know the future
But last night was nuts, and it never got new either
It go smell it like you buy it light, and hit it

I don't smoke regular like I don't eat whole wheat
I don't smoke men either
I got two bad bitches named Indica and Sativa
And we 'bout to have a threesome, alright
I'm in need of light
My high coming down, I feel like I'm eating right
Marijuana should be legal, I'ma fight for equal rights
I think I can, I think I can, got a nigga thinking twice
Coming straight from Cloud 9 like a lightning strike
Hit the blunt two times, then go nighty-night
She just want to open up, girl this a blunt for you
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said ""Girl, that's all that we do""

Fell asleep with another chick from my buildin'
Kick her ass out and have breakfast like a muh'fucker
I'm with another bitch by supper
Yeah, me and hate that's an odd couple
Hehe, you niggas fake you wouldn't pop bubbles
You can act stupid, bitch, I'm dumber

Have a ball 'til I fall though
And if I die today I bet the world end tomorrow

And I got blind money, money you will never see
And only in the mirror's where you'll find a better me

I don't know how I made it for this long in this condition

Knew I would score like Shaq did in school
Knew I was stupid, knew I looked like a big fool
I must have had the flu, I thought that shit was cool
Knew you would fall in love with me and the shit I do
But never knew you would murder me—what did I do?
Knew you was right for me, knew I was right for you
Knew I would help you sell, knew I would write for you
Knew I would keep you well, knew I would fight for you
Knew I would pull out my heart and bring it right to you
You knew all about me, baby
But you wasn't about me, baby, damn...

Felt like I was at the bottom of the seashore

Ugh, five karats on her finger, got her hand smitten
But everybody get a ring, even Scottie Pippen
Everybody got a thing, but I guess mine isn't
What my vision
So I just sits in my Lamborghini, let my top vibe with me
Kick back and get high with me, chyeah
And if she still get me
I hope my wife know she got a playa for life
And that's no bullshitting, heh
I push love to its full limits
Do a hundred-ninety in the lane called ""Memory""
And I know you in that lane with me
But when the light change, you didn't change with it
And now, I'm honking my horn
Got to get that dead grass off of my lawn
As I mose' on
The champagne's never froz-on, as it pours on the floor

I coach the winners they throw Gatorade on me
Silent four five, potato head on it
Ask me how I’m doing, I’m day-to-day homie
These bitches on my back, I fade away on ‘em
Young Tune, no Bugs Bunny bitch
And as long as I got a voice, I’m talking Young Money shit, nigga


Young Money bitch
Young Money sick
Now shut the fuck up and suck a Young Money dick
Velcro on my Asics sticking to the basic
Black white, and black pinky ring
I’m looking like a racist?
I’m higher than a satellite
You just a hermaphrodite
I’ve been real since BC, guess this is the after life
Drop out from heavens like, just to raise plenty hell
Boy I’m tryna touch a billion bucks before 2012
So that mean I’m focused
Beat my demeanour
These bitches talking dirty to me
Take ‘em to the cleaners
They say men are from Mars
Say women from Venus
But I’m in my space shuttle
Bout to serve em like subpoenas
The niggas keep me laughing like hyena’s
They only show they guns, Gilbert Arenas
Wassup Serena, you could be my baby momma

Kisha,Tha Block is Hot,1999.0,"Got a early call from Kisha, Kisha wanted me to meet her
She said she thought it was time to make the relationship get deeper
Said cool then I'm gon' beep ya
What would be a good time to reach ya
She said what about ten but l thought eleven would be sweeter
Cuz she wanted me to see her, said I needed a teaser
But shit who got the keys to my Beamer
I rolled me up a blunt and got the Cristal out the freezer
I hopped in the two seater, left Nae-Nae with Macita
Vroooom speed up run faster than a cheetah
Only thing on my mind is how l'm gone get all in this cheap slut
Should I use a rubber cause I heard she was a freak but
They say she keep it cleaned up, but I don't want HIV bruh
I drop my top on da drop-top (I'm bout ready to meet her), her name's on my beeper
I called her on the Nokia
And told her come pick me up
As soon as I got in the house she got on her knees and grabbed my penis
Ate
It up like some peanuts
I said ""oooohhhh Kisha""
Chopped off like a millimeter
She drunk it like a 2 liter
She blow like a pro, oh no I got to keep her
Told her l'd be back about eleven I'm gone creep her
But don't go you to sleep, I got some more meat to feed ya

Now I'm hot, I wonder what's up with Kisha tonight
I'm gone give her a call, see if it's alright
For me to dip through, she said it's all gravy
First I got to get somebody to watch my baby
(Baby) it's all good, I'll be there in a minute
But she didn't know I knew Wayne was already hittin' it
Soon as I pull up I see my dog runnin out
He saw me peepin at him, but he didn't open his mouth
Soon as he pulled off
I knocked on the door
Sayin to myself look at this dog ass ho
Its cool what you do
You know I like my shit sucked
For you to swallow the cum and put ice on my nuts
Caught my nut, now I'm up
I'm gone holla at ya Kittie
I got studio tonight, me and da H B'eezeys
I can't be late, I'm gon' see ya when I could
Hit Juve on the hip, let him know it was all good

Ooohh Oooh there she go, on the way to the corner store
Lil Turk let me know, we done fucked the same bitch before
Say lil mama where you headed, she told me forget it
Hop in the back seat of my car and she spread it
Say baby slow down I don't wanna fuck ya first
I want you to suck on my dick until my nuts will burst
She was a fool with it
She said she had a good teacher she went to school with it
Cuz she knew what to do with it
I didn't want the bitch to have my car all smellin
So I took her in the alley with some K Y Jelly
Pull your shorts and your draws down to your knees
Put the rubber on the dick handle that please
I hit it she sucked it
Hit it she sucked it and sucked it
I got tired of the pussy and mouth and I said fuck it
Hey ho, I gotta ride
My baby moma beepin me and she stay way on the other side
I hit B.Geezy on the celly
And told him that the bitch was all good up in the alley
Not the telly

This ho don't know I know she fucked three of my dogs
I caught her walkin out the alley down by the mall
She fucked Wayne, Juve, Turk, I know she ain't got no walls
But they told me she'd do a damn job on the balls
She provided the number later on gave her a call
Told her what I was thinkin and she was down with it all
Can't deny it she was a fool kept that dick standin tall
What she'll do a nigga, should be against the law
That's how Hot Boys play it when we finish we toss
Baby when you finish Manny Fresh down the hall
After this episode that ho won't be able to walk
After two or three steps that ho might just fall
Now you know then Hot Boys sad ha
Get in the bitch head, end up doing somethin bad ha

And before they cross me, they’ll nail me to it
And I'ma dance when it's hammer time
My insides fucked up, and it feels so good to be vandalized
And these bars is handlebars, 'cause when I spit, I handle mine
God made dirt and dirt don’t hurt, that’s a lie
Cause I come from that dirty-dirty, and I know pain like raps and rhymes, my nigga
Doing big things, big wings, dragonflies
If I don’t live to see tomorrow, all my kids got daddy's eyes

I hustle, hustle like the rent was due yesterday
Muscle car got more muscles than a heavyweight
Take these bitches breath away, resuscitate
And the weed I smoke is strong as pepper spray, that strong
Pussy walls I interior decorate
All the police ever say is stay behind the yellow tape
Put in over time, that’s why I get paid the big check
Tote a .45 'cause they ain’t make the .46 yet

Got all my niggas with me, that’s a no brainer
Fuck around and you can get shot up, like a low angle
Old ass money, I been ballin’ my nigga
And I been stop wearing Versace
'Cause I was wearing Versace when Pac was wearin' Versace

Uh, real niggas say, ""Woo woo""
And such and such kill such and such
The streets talkin', bullshit walks on crutches but it strut the strut
Niggas panic, button pressin', the end is coming, count your blessings
We livin' in the day and time, where the Ten Commandments are now suggestions
How depressin', how unpleasant, click-clack, pow intestines
Bad bitches in flower dresses with tight pussies, I found the crevice
High socks, and tie-dye shirts
My fashion statement is a run-on sentence
Pussy niggas still making me sick
Kill all them niggas, no more symptoms

I’m smokin' weed in my tool shack
I'm gettin' twisted like Allen wrenches
Bitch, come dance with the devil nigga like ballerinas in catechism
Got a AK with a shell-catcher
And I'll pistol whip ya 'til your head swell up
No Xanax, just coke and Henny
I had to kick that shit like 4/20
And I hit yo' ass with the SIG Sauer (Boom)
Had them put you back together like a jigsaw
And I'ma still bring that bacon home
I don't really give a fuck what the pigs thought
A pussy-ass rat, that's Tom and Jerry (Yeah)
I was gettin' fat off of commissary (Yeah)
And rest in peace to my nigga Soupy (Yeah)
I've been goin' in since Slime was buried (Suwoop)
And in jail, them snacks like bags of money
Just imagine what I had before a bag of cookies
A new deck of cards and a bag of coffee
Get you poked up dead in the shower, bloody
It's fucked up but it's safe to say
For the last seven months, I felt right at home (True)
And with the same pen that they stabbed you with
I'll wash that bitch off and go write a poem (Ugh)
Niggas sleepin' on me, had to shoot one time just to see who'd wake
I don't see your fate but I can see you fake
I gotta light my grass just to see you snakes
Bitch, life is a gamble
Pay up what you owe boy
No drive-bys like they did Ricky
I'm hoppin' out like Doe Boy
(Do-do-do-do-do)

Hustle like the rent was due yesterday
Muscle car got more muscles than a heavyweight
On the edge, just one step away so step away
And the weed I smoke is strong as pepper spray, that strong
Pussy walls I interior decorate
All the police ever say is stay behind the yellow tape
Put it over time, that’s why I get paid that big check
Tote a .45 'cause they ain’t make a .46 yet

Got all my niggas with me, that’s a no brainer, yeah
I got all my niggas with me, that’s a no brainer, yeah
Got all my niggas with me, that’s a no brainer, yeah
Blow your fuckin' brains out, that's a no brainer, hahaha",https://genius.com/Lil-wayne-no-brainer-lyrics

Ooh girl, you got me so weak
Ooh girl, your body unique, Amen, yes Lord
You

When you pass out wave and applaud, baby on call
Late at night spent on a beach
Hold hands and gaze at the stars, I play the guitar
When we fuck it's crazy, bizarre
She say I'm raising the bar
Her legs is ajar, her hair is a mess
She raising her arms, I stare at her breast, then I caress
And now she impressed, she say I'm the best, and I say I guess, and now she obsessed
And now she just text, with a request, to come be my guest, I said be my guest, have her W-E-A-K F-O-R W-E-E-K-S, I'm serious
I eat that pussy 'til she delirious, then she blow me like helium
Her tongue long, reptilian
Make love long, resilient, and then we spoon like cereal
And I came like four or five times, she just swallowed whole familia, and now I'm weak

She suck it slow, suck it fast, squeeze her cheeks together

But a lot ain't enough, so I got an occupation

Cause you probably won't live, to see the motherfuckin' cradle
Your past left a scar, and the future's lookin' fatal

When they put your homey to sleep, it's gotta be a wake up
You move in the hood, then you gotta meet the neighbors, damn

I'm tryin to get the pot to piss in in the mornin'

Like like, then kill yourself: 7 pounds
I’ve been to hell and back, and made it back fine
Black diamonds killin’ them, black-on-black crime

Well, shut the fuck up and steam the purp
Drink it all, I’m dead, so I throw some ice in it
And belch when I finish
(‘cuse me, ‘cuse me)

Fire up that wood, let the jets blast off
To another World, right next to that white moon
Fly in the sky, tell em we’ll be back soon

Uh, its the martian and I come for all
I swear I will go head up with all y’all, bumper cars

Smoke some kush and snap my fingers in case you got cat lives

Only smoking that real grass, no arena turf

He always out of town, he say he on the grind, he say she on his mind, she say you ""always lying""
He say ""Baby don't you see I'm out here on the rise?""

Don't I dick you down and make you holla like a soccer mom?
Don't I give you peace of mind, wa alaykum salaam

And if a nigga decide to test, their chest get completely took off
And if you wonder who the fuck are them killas with the money nigga
We be the squad. It's so serious like
It's like ain't nothin' but 10 hot shellys
On the block everyday sellin' rocks and shit
Choppin' bricks - give the damn cops a dick
We cop a whip and drop a brick - that's how we do it
Weed, liquor, money, and guns how we do it
Freak bitch to swallow cum like fluid
Who it be? Through his feet, Dubbs
Ain't nothin' sweet cause I can't keep trust
Lil' nigga - worth well over a mill, nigga
Real nigga - come around and show up where you live, nigga
Better hide the kids nigga parents and all
Wayne 'bout to damage your home
Look up out the window, see the man and his dawgs
Hoppin' out the van with bandanas and all
Cannons went off
News cameras takin' pictures of your family when your abdomen’s gone
Damn, it's a shame how the bullets slammed in your brain
How the ice slammed the pain, rammin' your dame
That's because she ran into the game
Nigga, stop playin' with Lil Wayne
Come on!

It ain't a game, nigga - I don't know who told you it was
I put holes in your mug if you're holdin' a grudge
Try to take 'em when you get the gun and load
And the slug check ya low when I bust
Come to show you no love
Uh, fuck with me now - they can't fuck with me now
No! They can't fuck with me now - they can't fuck with me now
Stop playin' with me get it understood
Cause I know if you know what's good for ya
Come around your hood for ya

Catch me on the ave with the crack and a 'matic
Hopin' that the law don't pass me - stash it
First of the month, just snatched me a package
Bag it - 'bout to get this motherfucker crackin'
If a nigga think about jackin', please believe
I be clip-slappin', click-clackin'
Pull the bitch back and run up on his parents
Kidnap for his snacks, and then whack him
Shit get drastic
That's why I try to stay as fars away from beef as I could
Grab me a freak to eats on my wood
Transport coke from each of my hoods
Weezy Wee - CMB's in my blood
Eagle Street 17's where I'm from
And I ain't got no feelins for none of these womens
Scrilla, Dough, fetticheese is my love
You know the streets made me
And I don't give a damn if you hate me
Nigga better be S-Q-A-D
Until the day the man do take me
Squad shit!
You don't want no violence to keep the quiet
We call my people wild, and then we beef in quiet
Or we'll creep in houses, we'll sweep your momma
So, please stay out it, or you leave in silence
Come on! What!

It ain't a game, nigga - I don't know who told you it was
I put holes in your mug if you're holdin' a grudge
Try to take 'em when you get the gun and load
And the slug check ya low when I bust
Come to show you no love
Uh, fuck with me now - they can't fuck with me now
Uh, they can't fuck with me now, them can't fuck with me now
Stop playin' when ya get it understood
Cause I know if you know what's good for ya
Come around your hood for ya
You don’t know me, I’ll kill everyone who should love ya
You have them motherfuckers lookin' all up in the woods for ya
Uh, fuck with me now - they can't fuck with me now
Uh, they can't fuck with me now - them can't fuck with me now
Come on!

It's too dark for ya's
I ain't got no love for ya's
Let gunshots smoked ya's
Who fuck with us?
Weed, liquor done corrupted us
Wet a nigga like umbrellas
Take the woman out a man; stomach out a man
Pump and bust, the guts comin' out a man
Runnin' out the Hummer with guns in each palm
If the motherfucker sleep, call him come get it
Niggas be kiddin' – me awake, DOA
Gun-spray - bullets damn near took off your son face
Oh, shit - niggas on that ho shit
Fours spit so quick like that lil' nigga ain't got no sense
Slow this shit down - let me get back down to reality:
I cause fatalities for any technicality
Wipe off your family randomly - U Understand?
It ain't a motherfuckin' game, and I ain't fuckin' playin'
Come on!

It ain't a game, nigga - I don't know who told you it was
I put holes in your mug if you're holdin' a grudge
Try to take 'em when you get the gun and load
And the slug check ya low when I bust

I point it at you and tell that motherfucker fetch
I'm fucking her good, she got her legs on my neck
I get pussy, mouth and ass, call it triple threat
When I was in jail she let me call her collect
But if she get greedy, I'ma starve her to death
Top down, it's upset, been fucking the world and nigga I ain't come yet
You fuck with me wrong, I knock your head off your neck
The flight too long, I got a bed on the jet
The guns are drawn and I ain't talking bout a sketch
I pay these niggas with a reality check
Prepare for the worst but still praying for the best
This game is a bitch I got my hand up her dress
The money don't sleep so Weezy can't rest
An AK47 is my fucking address, huh

I'm not a star, somebody lied I got a chopper in the car
I got a chopper in the car
I got a chopper in the car

Load up the choppers like it's December 31st
Roll up and cock it and hit them where it hurts
Cause if I die today, remember me like John Lennon
Buried in Louis, I'm talking all brown linen, huh

Big black, and an icey watch
Shoes on the coupe, that got a Nike shop
Counts the profits you could bring 'em in a Nike box
Grinding in my Jordans kick em off they might high, swish!
I'm swimming in a yellow bitch, boss
In the red 911 looking devilish
Red beam make a nigga sit down
Thought it were bullet proof till he got hit the fifth time
Drop ?
Make it come back even harder than before
Baby I'm the only one that paid your car notes
Well connected I got killers in Chicago

I'm not a star, somebody lied I got a chopper in the car
I got a chopper in the car
I got a chopper in the car

Load up the choppers like it's December 31st
Roll up and cock it and hit them where it hurts
Cause if I die today, remember me like John Lennon
Buried in Louis, I'm talking all brown linen, huh

Talk stupid get ya head popped
I got that Esther, bitch I'm red fox
Big b's, Red Sox
I get money to kill time, dead clocks
Your fucking with a nigga who don't give a fuck
Empty the clip, then roll the window up
Pussy niggas sweet, you niggas cinnabun
I'm in a red bitch, she said she finna come
200 thou on a chain, I don't need a piece
That banana clip, let Chiquita speak
Dark shades, Eazy E
Five letters, YMCMB
Bitch ass Nigga, pussy ass nigga
I see ya looking, with your looking-ass nigga
You know the rules, kill em all and keep moving
If I died today it'd be a holiday

I'm not a star, somebody lied I got a chopper in the car
So don't make it come alive
Rip ya apart than I put myself together
YMCMB, double M, we rich forever
The bigger the bullet the more that bitch gon bang
Red on the wall, Basquiat when I paint
Red Lamborghini till I gave it to my bitch
My first home invasion, pocket gain and 40 bricks
Son of a bitch, than I made a great escape
Ain't it funny momma, only son be baking cakes
Pull up in the sleigh, hop out like I'm santa claus
Niggas gather round, I got gifts for all of y'all
Take it home and let it bubble thats the double up
If you get in trouble that just mean you fucking up

Fresh of work, seeing this light-skinned jerk

While you getting bub, I'm getting pub
These songs I mean, these songs be mean
Got your label warring, Cause I'm making quality quantities
I got the holy spirit, but no father son

Now everybody know I'm shining in the coupe
No roof while I'm shitting on em
Rolling through the eastside, Hollandwood is hitting for
I'm all about my hustle, need my chips so I could stack it up
Gone on the pill got me rolling like a acura
Young money nigga, Yea I'm back like I left something
You niggas is jaw jacking, watch me sidestep son
Young nigga, got my money running like Barry
Bitches want my baby cause they heard about my salary

And all she ever wanted
Was for young Weezy to love her
But all I ever wanted was to cum easy and dump her
But that didn't come easy
'Cuz she ended up being my baby's mother
And then I felt smothered but little did I know
I'd never find the same girl inside another
But I never thought that I'd be looking for her
And I never thought that late at night
When I'm in the mix...laying down with some chick
That suddenly it'll click
How this broad in my drawers dont know shit
Bout what I did 'fore I was big
When's there's a woman with my kid where I should be
She screamed to me (What?)
My love, my patience, my pain (OK)
Nigga please

I got the young'n blues y'all (da-da-da-da-da)
I got the young'n blues y'all (da-da-da-da-da)
I got the young'n blues y'all (da-da-da-da-da)
I got the young'n blues y'all (da-da-da-da-da)

I met her after the fame
And she ain't even like me but I got her after the game
Mami was a nice piece, young Cali sweet thang
Made her into wifey and then reality changed
It was going good...I was happy again
But then things got rapidly strange
And it had to be Wayne
She was still a virgin
What more could I ask from a dame
But I was a bastard...I asked for the pain
Now my ass in the rain
And she got a new life...the picture flipped
And none of it includes Weez and all his bullshit (Shit)
And I remember the Bahamas for the weekend
We was freaking in the suite
And she looked sweet enough to beat it up
Till we began to sleep and I
I'm dreaming 'bout the Victoria Secret lingerie
Told me keep it..she ain't want moms to see it
And just think I once saw it on the girl's body
Now all I'm seeing is nobody

I got the young'n blues y'all (da-da-da-da-da)
I got the young'n blues y'all (da-da-da-da-da)
I got the young'n blues y'all (da-da-da-da-da)
I got the young'n blues y'all (da-da-da-da-da)

You see I never really ran, but no gentleman
All I know is big pimpin' ma'am
I'm just tryna be Weezy
And the perfect husband just might be too hard to find in me, Weezy
Baby girl you gotta work with ya boy
'Cuz all of that cursing it be hurting ya boy
Look for the better not the worst in ya boy
And maybe I can be ya boy...Ya know what I'm sayin'
But see this here is not your everyday love tune
It's the story of your everyday thug dude
And in your mind you prolly thinkin we don't love you
But on the real we just not used to what love do
And please consider that
We were taught to love money, ice, cars, and clothes
Love pussy but you dont love them ho's
Love ya niggas love ya children
Now if they got a bitch you could love that
Holla back

I got the young'n blues y'all (da-da-da-da-da)
I got the young'n blues y'all (da-da-da-da-da)
I got the young'n blues y'all (da-da-da-da-da)
I got the young'n blues y'all (da-da-da-da-da)

She say it feels she's up in a cell block
And I open her cell lock, I'm the (Postman)
Just come to make my mail drop, more masculine than him
I'm nastier than him, I'm passin' her and him
In something faster than them
And then he like, ""Damn, there go that bastard again, he the (Postman)""
And she correct him, and I respect her
And he protect her, and she neglect him
And he caress her, and she molest me
He must be weak cuz me, I'm just the (Postman)
And when her man home, I'm the ghostman
Why you think she holdin that pillow close, man?
Why you think she won't open the bathroom door?
She's no whore, she want more of the (Postman)

I'm at your walls like a thumbtack
So Miss Humpback, I know what to do with all that
Fall back, I'll put you a sinner, in the (Postman)

But I'm walkin' without reply
She got her legs up, she tryin' to walk in the sky
She callin' for God, and she callin' on I, she say (Postman)

He's here baby!"" She like, ""Yeah baby!""
Heres a chain letter and some magazines

Yeah, she love my gangsta, she feel my swagger
I'm there every week just to give her her package
I pick up her bills and I pick up her taxes
You might find a few stamps on your mattress from the (Postman)
She want young holly grove in a envelope
I'm her private note and you ain't gotta know
I'm her fantasy, she always got letters on the canopy
Waiting for the (Postman)
No postal service, I just got my social workin'
And your girl is lurkin', and this world is dirty
And your girl is nervous, to give me head in the convertible

She love me in her, and I love that plenty

Lights Off,Tha Block is Hot,1999.0,"Cut the lights off nigga (Cut 'em off)
You know what time it is (What)
You know what time it is (What)
Strap -Up (Gun Cocks)

Alot of niggas better move out
Cause here I come with my click
With the tools out
All of a sudden all these cowards
Startin to spook out
It's warfare a buncha of niggas
Bout to lose out
It's time to load up them thangs
Hit the spot run in his house
And make 'em show up then thangs
Take 'em in the room go in his pockets
And then blow up his brains
No matter the weather
Rain, snow, sleet, or hail
I'mma slangin' that metal
So tell 'em niggas in yo' hood
To get it together
Cause I'm with tola, mario
And we down for whatever
Never underestimate or you goin under, see
Y'all can keep playin with Lil Wayne
But that lil' boy trouble
And plus dis shorty be full, wodie
Be scorin bundles, then start wildin'
Hit the block and let his toys rumble
And it go ratter-tatter
Ya be suprised how niggas scatter
When the M-1 shatter
And everybody on the block
They get bout' ten in they bladder

Tell 'em lights off
Mask on
Creep silent
Your life's gone
We done left the block quiet
Tell 'em lights off
Mask on
Creep silent
Your life's gone
We done left the block quiet

Look, look
When it's time to ride
It ain't no time to play
It could be time to die
At any time of the day
And i'll be godammit
If I let a nigga steel me
It will not happen
Ima fire about a hundred and fifty shots at 'em
And got my Glocks rammin'
Leave a nigga spot damaged
That's how the beat made us
I chief three blunts
So I can get a head rush
Then come around the corner
And your whole day crush
I'm sick and tired
Niggas choose to test the water
They get hit and die
Some of 'em scared of man slaughter
So they stay inside
And watch they partners get lit up
And then they ask why?
That's cause you played wit' me
They could'nt of known im'a guerilla
Drama stayed with me
Ran in his home went to kill him
Took his head with me
You better get it right or keep it right
Or lose your whole town
Tell em' lights off
It's about to go down

Tell 'em lights off
Mask on
Creep silent
Your life's gone
We done left the block quiet
Tell 'em lights off
Mask on
Creep silent
Your life's gone
We done left the block quiet

Massacre all these streets; block it off
Lil Wayne is in yo hood
With something like a rocket dog
And I'm after ya
I don't pass beef
I stop at all
That boy got a head on his shoulders
I knock it off
I'm highly intoxicated mixing krystelle and vodka
Somebody call the doctor
Cause my chopper done went blocka, knocka
Nigga out the way man
I'm sorry but us guerillas we can't stay tamed, say it man
Are you ready, ready
Ready for warfare Wayne, Turk, Juve, and BGeezy they all there
We all flare, don't care, dog they all tear
Give the guns to the one with the long hair
Dem block burner
It gets quiet they see the rims twenty four seventy
(Breathes)they breathe heavlily
Bullets they come steadily
You better stay off the block
Cause you might fall
You better stay off the block
Cause the lights off

Tell 'em lights off
Mask on
Creep silent
Your life's gone
We done left the block quiet
Tell 'em lights off
Mask on
Creep silent
Your life's gone
We done left the block quiet
Tell 'em lights off

Creep silent
Your life's gone
We done left the block quiet
Tell 'em lights off

You Ain’t Never Gotta Ask,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Target practice, baby
Only thing is
I'm not the shooter
I'm the bullet bitch

They say your attitude determines your latitude
I'm high as a motherfucker - fly as a motherfucker
And still the motherfucker you love to hate
But can't, because you love what I make
Now ain't that about a bitch
And I'ma talk shit until I'm out of hits
They don't want to turn they speakers up they claim I ain't deep enough
All that talkin' I feed off of, keep it up
I'm relaxin' my feet is up, I'm leavin' you haters
Like when Shaq left the Lakers just to Heat it up
I state the stats to stunt, I don't need to front
Make black history e'ry day, I don't need a month
The survey says, by the streets according
Kanye's just important as Michael Jordan
Was to the NBA when he was scorin'
Ralph Lauren was borin' before I wore him and..

You ain't neva gotta ask again
How we got the world to listen
It ain't easy to pretend
I know you lost your cool
And it starting to come back again
Wake and stop it's just the beginning
You ain't never gotta ask again
Baby this is what we do

Yeah, what you want
And if you strapped, we can trade like the Dow Jones
Wet him up, I hope he got his towel on
I aim at the moon, and get my howl on
Some niggas cry wolf, i'm on that dry cush
And when it comes to that paper i stack books
Yeah, You heard what i said
I can put you on your feet or put some money on your head
Life ain't cheap, you're better off dead
If you can't pay the fee, shoutout my nigga Fee
See every muthafucka at the door don't get a key
You outside lookin in, so tell me what you see
Its about money, it's bigger than me
I told my homies, ""Don't kill him, bring the nigga to me,"" yeah
Don't miss, you fuckin with the hitmen
Kidnap a nigga, make him feel like a kid again

You ain't neva gotta ask again
How we got the world to listen
It ain't easy to pretend
I know you lost your cool
And it starting to come back again
Wake and stop it's just the beginning
You ain't never gotta ask again
Baby this is what we do

Now, e'rybody wanna be the king of the South
When, they ain't runnin a damn thing but they mouth
No doubt, it's all good, y'all just statin y'all opinion
But in the South and in the hood it's understood without sayin
It's a given, and ain't because of what I'm doin for a livin
It's more because of what I do and how I'm livin
Not to mention when I'm rappin I'm just hurtin niggas feelings
(Niggas feelings) And still chillin on somethin that's into healing
Made provisions for the clique to continue keepin it pimpin
Whether crack was in the house or record sales was through the ceiling
So say what you want, and do what you please
But for fun, I shoot 22's from your shoes to your knees
I run a record label and a crew of G's
So, niggas'll come and look for you if ya sneeze
Or even breathe the wrong way, you better do what the song say
And be easy, or else it'll be a long day

You ain't neva gotta ask again
How we got the world to listen
It ain't easy to pretend
I know you lost your cool
And it starting to come back again
Wake and stop it's just the beginning
You ain't never gotta ask again
Baby this is what we do

They say an eye for an eye, we both lose our sight
And two wrongs don't make a right
But when you been wrong and you know all along that it's just one life
At what point does one fight? (Good question right?)
'Fore you knock the boy, try to put your dogs in his
Ten-and-a-halfs, for a minute-and-a-half
Bet that stops all the grinnin and the laughs
When you play the game of life and the win ain't in the bag
When your options is none and the pen is all you have
Or the block, niggas standin tight, there's limits on the ave
Tryin to cop or shot-call theyself cleansin in the cash
But can't put they name on paper cause, then you on blast
Mr. President, there's drugs in our residence
Tell me what you want me to do, come break bread with us
Mr. Governor, I swear there's a cover up

See you can choose me, choose Mack or Gudda Gudd
Streets, Drizzy Drake, Tyga Tyga, or all the above
But no falling in love
We just fuck until we fall out and we fall asleep
You want a uptown hustler, you can call on me, I'm Jae Millz
For my money I make moves, like a R8 on the open street
I know you're nasty, I can see it in your eyes
I can tell how you move, it's written all in your vibe
So fuck your man, 'cause what he living is a lie
He commercial, it's only 10 seats on them planes that we fly
Plus I'm fly, and no exaggeration
But I'm so fly, fuck a plane, I'll get you to your destination
Holla at ya mizzann, it's Young Money
Life is good, fuck the forecast cause everyday is sunny

They ask who I go with, I say, ""Whoever wanna go!""
And we can go wherever you like
They ask me am I single, and I tell 'em, ""Hell no!""
They ask who I'm fucking I say 'whoever wanna know'
And I can fuck whoever I like

Got my two fingers out the roof, see me repping out
The Levi's is skinny, so I'm walking with the weapon out
Two bitches on my arm, get my Don Juan on
Watch the hoes go crazy when the boy song on
Multicolored stones on, we getting money, yeah
I get my Styrofoam on, my cup muddy
Yeah I walk down on ya bitch, then I run away with her
Let her do what she like, then I have my way with her
I ain't trying to play with her, I ain't trying to stay with her
I'm just trying to dick her down, nigga, you can lay with her
So give me MySpace like dot com
I'm Funkmaster Flex, with the flow, I drop bombs
""Young Gudda Moneybags,"" that's what they calling me
Shitting on you boys like I'm sitting on the toilet seat
Y.M.O.B. we on that Soprano shit
Every day, we blowing cash, we be on that Hammer shit

Like you can't touch this, like you can't touch us with a pipe
But we can touch whoever we like
You could even do Lil Chuckee, Lil Twist, KY, Bobby V
Lil Scrap, didn't say me, 'cause I got a wife
So, sorry, not tonight

Take ya body as a sacrifice
You see them flashing lights

She won't learn her lesson until she end up in the cop car
Yeah but I don’t want to take it that far
But I know she sue me if she end up with a cracked jaw

That's right
Everybody in the crowd put your tree'z up
Yeah, put your tree'z up
Let's go

3 in the mornin, I ain't home yet
Shawty blowin up my phone like a bomb threat
What's goin on baby?
Why you on that?
Knowin when I make it home I get ya thong wet
Okay I'm on my way, speedin windows up
So have my food warm, and have my pillows fluff
She been through the water, shawty guerilla tough
Shawty take all them shots like the Louis cup
I wanna give her all, and never give her up
I told her when it died down we could live it up
Where would you be, be without me?
Don't doubt me be about me baby, I'm like...


Yeah, I'm like
As soon as I come home, I was workin long
She wanna know what I was working on
So I play her this song
And I make her feel wrong
But still in all in my eyesight, she passed right
I can't trip cuz no one loves the fast life
Or sittin in the passenger seat, hold tight
When she gives a whole platter to me, her whole life
But for me that's too much to eat, in one bite but
I'mma chew and just do what I gotta
Other bitches get the boot like a high top Prada
Where would you be, be without me?
Don't doubt me be about me baby, I'm like...


Can I talk to her, yeah, um
Leave the drama on daytime television
What is this detention?
It feel like elementary
I wish I never injure
Hurt or scar you
When I think of my future
Baby that are you
I mean that is you
Part of my fears
You know, part of my mental
See what I'm into?
See how I'm in too deep in the shit too?
It ain't just you, it is us two
I trust you, you gotta trust me
Cuz in them other bitches eyes I'm a must-see
Now where would you be, be without me?
Don't doubt me be about me girl
It's killin me
Wooooo
I must like it when you question me about it baby

Gotta have somethin fast just to get out them jams
Got a big ass crib with a flow lil fuck
Got a roof all glass and that bitch split up
Got a house built look like a Mercedes booth
Ferrari sofa set with the Lambo' wrench room
Leskitted up kitchen set and Rolls Royce wall
Jaguar floors and fuck all yall
BMW lights, projectors to watch fights
Caddilac Benz, white fox for threads
Chin cheddar for Chi tower, ain't that crazy
I don't give a fuck homie, that's how I play it
Refridge designed like a Lexus with legs
In the fridge, it's quarters to replace the eggs

Too many prayers for forgiveness
Too many smiles when you hurtin'
Too many thoughts on your mind

And you always read your horoscope
Tryna figure if the nigga that you talkin' to the one
And your friends say no, dealership say no
But fuck it you got a body that'll pay the car note
Thirty percent for the down payment
Pull out the lot girl now you famous
You on your own and your'e doin' just fine
Every check stub wanna buy you time

It ain't hard when you feel it
Cause' when you feel it you kill it
Your pride gone now you willin'
Tell the world they in danger
Even tell a stranger

You all for the feeling
Yes you all for the feeling
You all for the feeling
And you ain't never walked away from that feeling

Take a breath and say something
Go on ahead, talk about it
Money over discussion
Make a little something out of nothing
And all these promises, they all bluffing
Water the seed till the soils muddy
Uh, and every holiday you work
And when I have time you be at work
Damn, I guess you're looking for better
But I'm digging in that pussy like i'm lookin' for a treasure
And the feeling don't die if you don't let it, but you don't let it
That's why I give you credit, and today my lucky day
Today she doin' nothing, so when we get together
I put it in her stomach she say

Tunechi I feel it
She feel it when I kill it
Her pride gone now she willing
Tell the world they in danger

Go on ahead, talk about the weeks
Talk about the months, talk about the pussy niggas
Man they all punks, live for the moment
Life ain't fair, sorry for the feeling
No grey hair, you ain't worried about nothing
Turn nothing into something
And never let that go

Tell the world they in danger
Even tell a stranger

You all for the feeling
Yeah you all for the feeling
Yes you all for the feeling
God willing
You never walk away from that feeling
You all for the feeling
Yes you all for the feeling
Keep your head to the ceiling
Kill it when you feel it
Cause' you all for the feeling

But you ain't gotta say nothing
Because, your eyes say everything
They asked me why I did it

Living in a world a fantasy

His back against the wall
Cut the music up in my phone
Living in a world a fantasy
(Living in a world a fantasy)
Perfect
His back against the wall

Straight off the corner of Apple and Eagle
Braveheart bitch like the times are medieval
Married to the block, divorced the cathedral
Standing on the corner selling porcelain to people
Forced into evil, it's all in your head
It's all so cerebral, call me Knievel
You follow and I lead you straight to the needle
The bottle, the battle, the beetles'll eat you
Momma named Cita, I love you Cita
'Member when your pussy second husband used to beat you?
Remember when I went into the kitchen got the cleaver?
He ain't give a fuck, I ain't give a fuck either
He could see the devil, see the devil in my features
You could smell the ether, you can see Cita
You can see the Cita, see the Cita in my features
I am her voice and the world is my speaker
I'm speaking

Living in a world a fantasy
(Living in a world a fantasy)
His back against the wall
Living in a world a fantasy
(Living in a world a fantasy)
His back against the wall

With my spine up against these tagged up brickwalls
Flip grams, quick hand, quicksand, pitfalls
Big balls intact through error Syntac's
The stormy weather where the trees don't bend back
Left home at 16, I ain't never been back
When it come to being broke they say I never been flat
A punk ass bitch, I ain't never been that
Reminisce on daddy's caught a schlitz in his lap
And it's Newport Box with only one stick left
Snort heroine, then he shove me in his chest
Used to really believe I'll never be the best
Hell must be on my shoulder cause the devil sing the rest
Right on it through his bignes with them poisonous syringes
Beating on my mama, kick the door of the hinges
I wish I was old enough to stop him when he did it
So long ago, but even I can't forget it, so listen

Living in a world a fantasy

His back against the wall
Living in a world a fantasy
(Living in a world a fantasy)
His back against the wall

Demonic in my presence, street corner like a reverend
Trying to find the change, shining lightining light in heaven
Triple 7, triple 6 - tribulations, triple trick
Triple grip, triple spitting like I had a triple lip
Let's make simple sense of the main difference
Angel of Death swing, got a sinner in a clench
Revolver in my fist, earthworm to a fish
Bait on the line, watch me catch 'em with this
Coke fly off compound, off round white rock
Balling like Earl Manigault in his high top
Third eye cyclops, beaten down my five cops
Left for dead and this ain't even my block
Thinking of my pops, thinking of my moms
Rather be just blazing listening to Saigon
Cause when you think up God strike you down
Body full of current, lightning never hit the ground

Did It Before,The Drought is Over 2: The Carter 3 Sessions,2008.0,"Ohh, this feel good, alright, Ye
Carter Trey, all day, let's play, haha

Okay
I know two girls that done did it before
But I wonder if they know that we did it before
If the other girl know that we did it before
Shit I wonder if she know well if she didn't hell know
That we did it before yeah we did it before
Shit I wonder if she know well if she didn't hell know
That we did it before yeah we did it before
Shit I wonder if they know that we did it before

Okay, put your hands up if you did it before
Now your girl lookin' at you cause she didn't hell know
And now everybody sayin' that you did it before
And you know that's because they probably did it before
Cause if they did it before it would be different though
I wonder if Tammy knows, that I did it before
With Nisa, I wonder if she didn't hell know
That we did it before I know they did it before
The day we did it but oh, if they did it before
And we did it before, we can get it fa' sho
Cause if she with it, I know she should be with it fa' sho
I'm a tear that pussy up, like I didn't before
And after I did it they be history though
When I see em I act like I didn't hell know
That we did it before like we didn't before
But we did it before, hehe

Okay
I know two girls that done did it before
But I wonder if they know that we did it before
If the other girl know that we did it before
Shit I wonder if she know well if she didn't hell know
That we did it before yeah we did it before
Shit I wonder if she know well if she didn't hell know
That we did it before yeah we did it before
Shit I wonder if they know that we did it before

Yeah, so if you did it before, be a pro
You gotta act like you didn't before
And everytime I meet a girl
They say that she didn't before
You know I gotta act like I never did it before
But she would be dumb if she didn't hell know
Cause I did it before and she will be dumb
If she think that I didn't, hell know
That she did it before, she probablly didn't go low
So we did it some more and we did it some more
Like Busta Rhymes said, she holla ""give me some more""
So we did it some more, yeah, we did it til' four
And when four-o-one came, she was hittin the door
Not fixin' to go but she was hittin' the door
And I was probably butt naked just twistin' an O
Then I call my homies up, kick the shit how it go
And I know they gon' laugh cause they did it before

Okay
I know two girls that done did it before
But I wonder if they know that we did it before
If the other girl know that we did it before
Shit I wonder if she know well if she didn't hell know
That we did it before yeah we did it before
Shit I wonder if she know well if she didn't hell know
That we did it before yeah we did it before
Shit I wonder if they know that we did it before

Okay, a lot of folks don't like to say they did it before
Wishin' that everybody didn't hell know
That they did it before, like if they did it'd be low
Or if they did it with more, than one, or did it for dough
Well if you didn't, then so, be cool with it and flow
And just rock with everybody, that done did it before
I know I did it before, you know you did it before
How come you ain't with it now, but you was with it before
Oh, that's your best friend, yeah, ya'll kick it I know
Ya'll probablly did it before, she probably licked it before
Like it was liquid before, yeah, I can vision you both
Like I done did it before cause I done did it before

Okay
I know two girls that done did it before
But I wonder if they know that we did it before
If the other girl know that we did it before
Shit I wonder if she know well if she didn't hell know
That we did it before yeah we did it before
Shit I wonder if she know well if she didn't hell know
That we did it before yeah we did it before

While I sit on your girl bread like her last meal
I blew up before I grew up
Got introduced to the game, now I'm at they heads like crew cuts
Suit up and lace your boots up
It's war time

Fuck Today,UnKnown,2010.0,"Sitting on my porch, sippin’ on Jim Beam
Read the newspaper, man, guess what I seen
Shit bad enough to make a grown man scream
And then I woke up, it's not a bad dream
Eh, I don’t really wanna talk about it
Cause every time I talk about it, I go off about it
And every time I get like that, I wanna start somebody
This world really got you thinking that you on somebody
So what, you got a gun, I don’t give a fuck about it
I would take every bullet and every buck up out it
So, motherfucker, cock it back and please buck away
Cause right now I’m feeling fuck you

And fuck today, fuck today

Cause I’m feeling like I had about enough today
Cause I’m feeling like I had about enough today

Don’t you see that this whole world is my stage
And I must perform to the best of my abilities, yeah
Motherfuckers talking away, but we don’t care what they say
I'ma take this shit day by day

Man, I woke up on the wrong side of the bed this morning
And my tank on E, plus the gas prices soaring
Baby momma trippin', tryna get me for my money
Now she laughing to the bank and ain't a damn thing funny
My momma lights off and my daddy don’t call
And my nigga got killed, man damn, I miss my dawg
The landlord buggin' and the rent keep coming
And the heater broke, I gotta warm my house with the oven
Every time I think about it, man, it get depressing
And the stock market down, the whole country in recession
Plus the cops got a warrant out, they trying to arrest me
Man, this whole day startin' to stress me, nigga so

Fuck today, fuck today

And I must perform to the best of my abilities, yeah
Motherfuckers talking away, but I don’t care what they say
I'ma take this shit day by day

Okay, these are the days, the days of our lives
Well, do you have a calender because I lost mine
Uh, I lost mine, uh, I lost mine
I’m the sickest virus on and offline
Imaginary line, you don’t wanna cross mine
Found a clock in the street, I’m making up for lost time
Third eye blind but it’s still fuck the bullshit
Knowing what I got but more conscience of what I could get
Tired of the same shit, don’t know who to blame, shit
And we knew a black President wouldn’t change shit
Money still a language, well ain't nobody talkin’
They found my calendar in the garbage, so

Fuck today, fuck today
Fuck everything gon be alright, fuck okay
Cause I’m feeling like I had about enough today
Cause I’m feeling like I had about enough today

Fuck everything gon be alright, fuck okay

And I must perform to the best of my abilities, yeah
Motherfuckers talking that shit
We gon have to see what I did
Cause I don’t give a fuck about it
And I don’t give a shit about you
I don’t give a damn about you

No more Lil Tunechi, no more king of rap
Life can be gone in a blink of an eye

Holy,Tha Carter V (2014 Version),2019,"I just bought myself a 9 and my brother a Tech
Got too much on my mind hit the blunt and reflect
When I was under arrest my bitch was under the rest
I bet she fucked while I was gone, then I double the bet
I smoke weed in Amsterdam, and I smuggle the rest
I act like I'm shaking your hand and you get punched with the left
And you can get killed for shit you said under your breath
And if you do choose to bark, it ain't none to a vet
Man, fuck these niggas, I ain't stuntin' these niggas
Yo bitch about to swallow a bunch of me's, nigga
I got a white girl fucking, sucking me, nigga
While I'm thinkin' 'bout the days that it sucked to be niggas

Bought myself a 9 and my brother a Tech
Nigga, keep your head up like that gun in ya neck
And my bitch was scared to fly 'till we fucked on a jet
Fucked her in the cockpit, all these buttons to press

I just got myself a blonde with the puffiest chest
I just bought myself some time, rolled my Rollie a check
Ridin' in a double R, just Regretting Regret
Getting loaded more than once, no Russian Roulette
I just left King of Diamonds, I just fucked a baguette
I ain't called her since that day, I just wasn't impressed
Move with a nose ring, startin' a bunch of BS
Hide the gun, knock on yo door, dressed like UPS
Man, fuck these niggas, I ain't stuntin' these niggas
I'm a bear coughing up a bunch of honeybees, nigga
Got hoes under me, like a submarine, nigga
Got a bitch with a clit like a butter bean, nigga (uh)

Bought myself a 9 and my brother a Tech (yeah)
Bought my sons toys and my daughter a pet
Bought my homeboys choppers and my woman a dress
And to catch me if I fall, I bought my mother a net
Let's go

Anyone could get knocked off
Any bitch could get knocked up
Baby daddy get locked up
Sell everything, put the house up
Don't say anything, keep your mouth shut
Except two words and that's ""How much?""
If I do get out, we're skipping time
She said what about her mama
I paused
I said ""I gotta do what I gotta
Is you gon' ride with me or you not""
And she start cryin' and said ""I'm not""
And I paused
I said ""It's probably what's best
Well, I'll be back when pigs fly
So they can follow on my jet""
I tell my pilot where to go next
I bring that problem to your doorstep
I catch you slippin' while you tired
Like the road wet
Like it's no sweat
I'm Tunechi, hi, I'm here to collect
They wondering why I ain't getting no rest
'Cause that's just too close to arresting
And to far from certain protects
Oh, Police, read me my wrongs
Or just leave me alone
Rubbing, squinting my eyes
I still don't see where I'm wrong
Sold my soul to the streets
They bought it previously-owned
Went to jail for a Glock
And soon as I got home

I went and bought myself a 9 and that new MAC 11
You talk shit at 10:59 and make the news at 11:00
Bitch, I'm the wildest motherfucker on a team full of rebels
Young, wild motherfucker to a MILF, cougar, leopard

I'm a lion, motherfucker, to these hoes 'cause you can sweat a little
Euro my secret weapon like Mark, Jackson and Stephen
I see plain clothes pigs and unmarking trappers
My bitch believe what I say
I told her ""Salt, what's pepper""
I'm cold as malts and metals
Sell stolen parts
Whatever
Put three holes in your head like a bowling ball
Don't spare 'em
And all my niggas in jail
That's bullshit, I smell ya
Remember Destiny's Child
My favorite one was Farrah
Man

Bought myself a 9 and my brother a Tech
I know you don't want war like you just a cadet
Tell a motherfucker who next
""Motherfucker, you next""
I'm the best
Rapper alive and they love me to death
Bye
Yeah
Fuck these niggas, I ain't stuntin' these niggas",https://genius.com/Lil-wayne-holy-lyrics

How come every bad bitch with a pussy wanna fuck em'
But I just feed em' drugs and just watch em' fuck each otha
My neck was a hundred, and my wrist was anotha
It make her pussy wet I leave that bitch with a puddle
I'm a beast I'm a dog, I should rap with a muzzle
Peyton Manning flow, I just go no huddle
Baby girl gettin' straight dick, no cuddle
You know I'm out this world, I just bought a space shuttle
I'mma put some D's on that bitch!
And these hoe's starting to get like flea's on my shit
Have you seen the who nina she's on my hip
Yellow white diamonds call it cheese on em' grits

And every time I send my girl outta town
I put some D's on that bitch!
I'm a certified gangster
Hater's make me nauseous, so money make me anxious
Listen how my words are poetic like Langston
Dreads down my back like I come straight from Kingston
But I come from Hollygrove, 17 danger zone
So many c note's I could sing a song
T-top coupe, lookin' like a thong
Your girl love my dick, she treats it like a bong
I don't want be right if gettin high is wrong
My eyes so low I look like I'm from Hong Kong
Boy I got more green than a bitch of Don Juan

Ok, I'm not a rookie I'm a pro; Methazine fiend
Make the homies say Hoe, and make all the girlies scream
I am a vegetarian man I only eat beats
Wear a lot of carrots and I smoke the best green
No beef, in my grocery bag
Just some Swisher's and a whole bunch of cans of Whoop Ass
I'm strapped like a bookbag
So any one of ya'll can come on and get a foot tagged
Eat all day
Ride all night
Sleep no way
Sleep when I lay
Six feet deep
And until that day
I'mma be livin' like it is that day
I keep holdin' on

If you don't like it I roll over and roll alone
Fuck you and the horse that you rode in on

Bloodline,500 Degreez,2002.0,"The streets make the hustlas
Hustlas make the world go round
The world is made of keys, ounces and pounds
The keys, ounces and pounds is made from hustlas
See how shit come back round for ya
Gotta cop it, chop it and cook it
See how shit come back round for ya
Gotta kick in the oven now watch it bubble
And you can knock on my door
But you can't knock the hustle
But I- it's like a game of twenty-one and I got nineteen
And my J butter put more 'd' on me
Lil Weezy Wee gon eat that's how it is
Got insurance on the floor man I'm that positive
And I'm shaggy in the saggy lens
Me an my squad in the paddy wagon tally Benz
And you know I put the mags on that
.45 mack with the flash on that
Who want it
Everybody sing along

Now I'mma ride cuz I got riding in my bloodline
And I'mma shine cuz I got shining in my bloodline
I get that dough cuz I got hustle in my bloodline
I bleed concrete

And when I move, I move out with the raw
I move out with the squad
To his album we ride we so mob
I throw lives and lowest to live
For my loaf of bread the people's player
I did what the culture said
And I live by La Costra Nostra said
Fuck around I'll knock your shoulder from your head
Get it right I'm a soldier till I'm dead
This kid is white with buttonholes inside that bled
I'm pumping o's with lots of hay
I'm so high and really I don't even know why
And oh I just go buy a whole house
And lay my mat down lay her back down
But I never put my mack down
You see the thug in me
You know Weezy he the young son of Bubba-B
Buy my basketball shorts with a thunder B
If you want it then come to me
I'm right here


I'm G'd up
Only follow the code of the streets
Live bad to die good
Know how to move when hustling by the days with no food
But just so I can eat
And ain't it a bitch
And if you see me getting fat I'm probably getting rich
And you probably can see me for some crack before six
And after that it's all bricks
A fake and my palm is wrapped around this eight
And my arm because the dirty south is straight Vietnam
I skate with the bomb
I'm asking you don't play with me at all
Shots hit your ass and make three of y'all
It'll take three of y'all to fill one of my shoeprints
Cuz I did and do shit that's better than new shit
Fit for two clips

Awww man, he's inspired by his own gangsta music

Without the patch on my eye
Take a patch out the sky, cause I’m fly
I say that a lot and Imma keep on
Thousand dollar jeans on nigga keep going
Keep walking, piece on
You won’t find me in my beach home
I’m out ya reach arm
I got a speech for ‘em, um
Fuck them and whoever know ‘em, one
I’m stepping in Roberto's with a nasty ass virgo
She feeling my gangsta, I ain’t even have to game her
But that came natural sort of like magical
I disappear when I dip in the bathroom
But I’ll be back soon fucking wit them raccoons
Like Jackie Gleason on his honeymoon
What up Fuke?

Hot Spitter in the building
Young Money in the arena
Ya catch me with two bad bitches between us

By any man I’m in fact, ha ha
And its like that
My impact so hard if I die
I probably bounce right back
I walk around with a mice trap
Niggas wit cheese don’t like rats
And despite that
I been around a few gold fish
I’m still a shark out the ocean
I wear the fuck out the 0 6, 4 sent flow
Like I’m 4'6"", left arm so stiff
Yall don’t shit about this stuntin’ business

Smoke Session,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Damn I can't believe she left me like this
I mean I brought her to the airport but I can't believe she jumped on the plane and left me like this

And I would leave but I had to take a minute in the smokin section
Tryin to let the pain ease
Watchin her plane leave
Trippin in the smoking section
Tryin to regain me
How can I get a grip when I lost my main squeeze
And now im stuck inside of an ashtray
Like a cigarette
But my heart pumps gasoline
And this she know
I just crashed and burned
Now here come the smoke

Find me where u left me burnin in the smokin section
Up in smoke
Whats left u'll find it in the smokin section
Find me where u left me burnin in the smokin section
Up in smoke
Whats left u'll find it in the smokin section

I gave myself a hour to sit at the gate
I booked us yesterday flight 378
U think I gave him enough time to change my mind
I love him but I couldn't this time
I packed it all up in my two bags and one carry on
U would think I was sure but it feels so wrong
A piece of me is strayed over still with you
I guess ill smoke my last stuck wonderin what I should do

Find me where u left me burnin in the smokin section
Up in smoke
Whats left u'll find it in the smokin section
Find me where u left me burnin in the smokin section
Up in smoke
Whats left u'll find it in the smokin section
Im like hold on whats up
Shorty what u goin for
She packed up
Dipped out
Now she left me all alone
Back up in the smokin section
Damn she got me really trippin
Weezy tell me what u sippin
I f**ked up on this situation
Please pass me a cigarette
My nerves back calm down
She always used to promise if she leave she'll be back around
I guess its sum things as a man that im missin
So at the end of the night u can find me in the smokin section

Find me where u left me burnin in the smokin section
Up in smoke
Whats left u'll find it in the smokin section
Find me where u left me burnin in the smokin section
Up in smoke
What's left you'll find it in the smokin section",https://genius.com/Lil-wayne-smoke-session-lyrics

Money on my mind
(what the) fuck a nigga thought?
He ain't even thank
He didn't even see me with the pistol in the shade
Walked up to him put the pistol to his tank
Pussy nigga faint
Pick that pussy up
Naw let him lay
Where I'm from we see a fuckin dead body everyday 
Hammer in the draws
Hammer in drawers
And ya'll ain't nothin but nails in the wall
Posters, holsters
Empty like a muthafucka
Off my hip, clip empty like a muthfucka
Hehe, ok simply I'm a bug- lover
It's fly carter, duckin the fly swatter
Simply, I'm a muhfucka
Pimpin' ain't dead, because I'm pimpin like a muhfucka
Now where ya ho at?
Wipe ya feet on the door mat
I'm a bring in, no back
Like em to go with no back
I'm a-go forward, the top can get lower, them hoes 'gon get cut
Like a sword, I know it
You ain't gotta tell me
I already smell it
You pussy niggas eatin' peanut butter and jellys
Ya los' like angeles
But you can find me in the white tan Ellis
Just like Van Halen
I'm a rock out bitch
I'm a wear that Glock like a fucking outfit
I don't care what you know
You ain't no nothin' 'bout this
And I hope your ass choke when you suck my dick

Ok, I’m strapped up
Im strapped up, downtown many acts straight jackets ain’t strapped up
And scrappin we could do, see scrappin what we do
And I’m like let me at em! Call me Scrappy Doo
Hazardous to scrap with you I ain't lookin stupid
You beat me? Too bad, bitch, I’m comin back shootin!
Fool I’m a fool, I do what I do
It’s like fixing broke cars, which tools i'mma use?
Tha Tech or the Uz, the Mac or the Rug
Catch you when it’s just you, You’re like “it wasn’t just you!”
I guess i’m just to real for niggas to adjust to
Fuck me? Naw bend over nigga, fuck you
See I know what’s what, who’s who, and who is you
Move you lose you move an inch and more ligaments that you could lose
I’ll put you on the 10 O'clock news
One, two, buckle ya shoes
Here come the Kid who
Ooo gloves Uz will fill up your old wounds
Dudes using more tools than Tim from Home Improve
Then I play it cool, smooth as James Brown shoes
Don’t play with him cuz shoot he’ll shoot

I’m playin duck duck goose, boy I’m slick like mouse

Homie roll with game and he wear a lot of jewelry
You lazy women bore me your baby mama call me
Little pig fucker so they call me John Coffee
See a flock of women i'mma run through 'em softly

I Don’t Need Her,Unreleased Songs,2018,"I Am Not A Human Being
Part 2, Check me out

Yeah, Uh
I fell in love with a pedestrian
'Cause she walked right over me
I should run over that bitch at a crosswalk
In my new Mercedes, I forgot to dance when she played me like a ukelele
Huh, just another sad love song
Like Toni Braxton, should've played you like a saxophone
At least we coulda made music, instead of trippin'
I bought the bitch a dozen 
roses
 with eleven missin'
Huh, she said she wanna be a lifeguard
Bitch, you can't even save yourself, fuck you talkin' 'bout?
Huh, I park my dick up in her garage
But I shoulda treated that pussy like a parking lot
Yeah, the players fucked up
She was loose as a goose but I should've ducked
Her, and sure, I still hit her up, but only to say I fuckin' hate you, bitch

I gave her flowers, but they weren't roses
So she threw them back in my face (Yeah)
And now my life is lookin' up now (I-I fuckin' hate when I'm insecure)
And she's already been replaced (Fuck)
I don't need her, you know I don't need her
I don't need her anymore (I fuckin' feel like I'm about to cry)
No, I don't need her
She know I don't need her (Like when Tom Hanks lost Wilson on Castaway)
But now she's seemin' insecure (Damn)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Uh, okay I got a new one
And she never pissed me off
That's a toilet bowl, no urine
And I used to think about you when I be wit' her
Oh, now you fly?
Bitch I knew you when you were a caterpillar
And homicide, crosses my mind
Once or twice I admit
I feel like an asshole, that ain't never have shit
Now some say love is a drug I beg to differ
'Cause I sniffed her, and I smelt another dick on her breath
And still kissed her
Fuck I'm stupid
I kidnap cupid
And teach him how to hate
Then teach him how to skate
No, you ain't on my calendar, but at least I got a date
To drown you out I buy a house, buy a beach and buy a lake
I fell defeat to my mistakes, but who doesn't?
I heard your man was gay
Does that mean you have 2 husbands?
You fuckin' slut
I'd do better fuckin' sluts up the butt
Then let you come and kiss the shit out my dick, pucker up
Ha

I gave her flowers, but they weren't roses
So she threw them back in my face
And now my life is lookin' up now
And she's already been replaced
I don't need her, you know I don't need her
I don't need her anymore
No, I don't need her
She know I don't need her
But now she's seemin' insecure
Yeah, yeah, yeah

See, when times get hard
So does my dick
And for some funny reason
I think of you
And um
I just wanna grab a rifle and
Shoot myself in the head because
I-I-I just can't get rid of the thoughts
Bitch
[Chorus 3 / Outro: Ben & 
Lil Wayne

I gave her flowers, but they weren't roses
So she threw them back in my face
And now my life is lookin' up now 
As a matter of fact, let me take that rifle
And she's already been replaced 
And I'ma um
I don't need her, you know I don't need her 
I'ma swing by your crib
I don't need her anymore 
And um
No, I don't need her 
I hope your man is there
She know I don't need her 
I-I still got that key
But now she's seemin' insecure 
That you gave me

Split swishers with my thumb

Cause I ain’t promised day two
Throw that pussy at me
Bitch I think I’m Babe Ruth
Drop top Maybach on the way
Yeah that’s that new Landaulet
She let me into her jungle
I’m gonna hit her with that rattlesnake
Guns clap like patty cake
Blood gang, red bandanna face
Make them pussies pop they-self
You can call that “masturbate”
I don’t front no fabricate
I get high, I gravitate
Weezy F Baby bitch, the F is for Fascinate

The coupe blue like the ‘do on Marge
Ridin with a bitch prettier than a Debarge
Mommy want a soldier, baby I’m a Sarge
You can’t have me but we can have a menage (that’s 3)
Now rub me wrong and fuck up my massage
And it’s flowers for the dead, better get em a corsage
Yeeaa, head nigga in large
And everything I do, I San Diego Charge
While you niggas just starve
I’m eating so much I'mma fuck around and barf
And, red is the color of my scarf (B's up)
And understand – to a giant, you’re a dwarf
My flow’s throwed off
I’m so sick all I got to do is cough

Bitch I come from the bottom of the map
New Orleans, Louisiana, we love to pack gats
We love to count stacks, we love to pump back
I love killing the track; me, Wayne, Ronny, and Mac
That’s some Hollygrove shit, yeah
And I'mma bang it in your ear until you get it clear
You heard that? That’s my word, and I meant that
Don’t tempt me, I leave ya bent up in your Bentley
Believe me

Yeah it’s Ronny, back in the game
Straight off the block, back in the game
Now run, tell you heard me rapping with Wayne
Run, tell you heard me rapping insane
Yea, I’m off in this bitch, puffing drogas in this bitch (bitch)
I’m leaning in this bitch, we got freaks in this bitch
We deep in this bitch

I got a thing for them big trucks
Big, fine bitches with good jug and big butts
5, 4 mommies with nice head and fake tits
That don’t get loose off Goose and probably act up
5, 7 bitches with bowlegs that take dick
All they really need is like two pills and 6 blunts
Wake up in the morning and count money and make grits
She don’t really know no English so we don’t say shit
(Mack Maine) Yeah, Wayne said let it rain on them (I did)
Mother nature with the paper, doing a Mack Maine on em
Like, there go 1000, like swoosh
Like, there go 2000... (ballin)
Now shake that ass like you can’t
Pay your cable bill and you tryna watch the Saints
On the 60 inch Hitachi, living like Liberace
Sporting the latest Versace, shotty and Maseratis
Dodging the paparazzi, AC cold like the heart of Nazis
This here a classic like old school Hirachis
Then get your grill cooked like it was Hibachi

After Katrina, after the towers
We holds our heads high after disaster

When the levees broke

What's going on my nigga, the same shit
After Katrina, after the towers
We holds our heads high after disaster

They couldn't kill me holla if u feel me
Hurricane Katrina victim in the building
Okay, day time soldier, night time rider
911 survivor, yeah I feel you
And who am I to try to keep hope alive
When I'm seeing dead babies floating by
Damn, burning buildings, flamed up
They couldn't take da heat so they jumped
Man, they want to want to transform the streets we grew up on
A deck of cards with no aces: luck gone
Uhh, tower 1 fell, tower 2 fell
Now everybody screwed like loose nails
I'm like what are we to do with a house with no roof
Look up and pray to whose above you
God, yeeup, now just look in your seat
Black people, white people, all covered in debris, yeaah

What's going on my nigga, the same shit
After Katrina, after the towers
We holds our heads high after disaster

Try to keep our head up, and not get fed up (nope)
But it seems like they won't let us live
Yea, and I was told that life ain't shit and this world ain't neither
This is why I scream fuck the world not the people (nope)
Yes, but in the belly of the beast
People get swallowed like meat, eat
And your president was lying while my people was dying
In the helicopter flying looking down reading signs
Help! SOS, somebody save us
Ten dead inside, where our savior
And, I've seen tragedy I've looked it in the eye
Hate being at my lowest so I choose to get high
High, so high, that my name should be sky
It's a bird, it's a plane, no it's I
Yea, I holla five on four till they bury me man
I'm the father of New Orleans and I'm a family man
You heard me

You know the same shit

We holds our heads high after disaster

After Katrina, after the towers
We holds our heads high after disaster
Now, if I should die before my time, Lord
Take care of Jew Jew and his mom (please)
Take care of little Jah (please)
Take care all the kids (please)
'Cause through us they live
Yeah, lord please keep your eyes on me
And if I die, I pray my soul you keep
And I don't want this world to kill me, but I'm getting so weak
I can't take much more, I just want to be free
Free, they said they knew there was a problem with the levees, and they did nothing (nothing)
Clinton approved the money, and Bush did nothing (nothing)
So, Katrina hit, and three days later, Fema just comin'
I'm feeling like what the hell is really goin' on
Planes into buildings, what's next King Kong?
I wish we didn't even have a reason for this song (but we do) Moment of silence for the people that's gone (Shhhhh)
To those restin' in peace, those dead and deceased, soon again we meet (soon)
Or 'til I'm high and drunk and my car swerves off road, haa
I'll meet you at the crossroads
Lord, please keep your eyes on me
And if I die, I pray my soul you keep
And i don't want this world to kill me, but I'm getting so weak
I can't take much more, I just wanna be free

Fuck them foes up

Tell my bitches it’s show time, tell my niggas it’s go time
Sipping lean, I’m on a slow time, choking off the weed like it’s a bowtie
Shoot your ass up in no time, and all my shooters gon’ cosign
And all you haters get paid no mind, money talks, I told it speak your mind
All my niggas for-lifers, and all my bitches one-nighters
And all my hoes curvaceous, and all their clothes are enticing
None of my bitches got prices, none of my niggas got licenses
I’m on my 56 Nights shit, I fuck with that Future like psychics
I’m in the suite eating snow crab, I’m in the street like the dope man
We do drive-bys in Mopeds, smoke strong like Popeye, Conan
I beat the pussy up, I just throat jab, I got her legs in the air, that’s a toe grab
I make the bitch call me Macho Man, I’m sipping on lean bumping Slow Jamz, hey
Tell my niggas it’s show time, tell my niggas it’s show time
Sipping lean, I’m on a slow time, choking off the weed like it’s a bowtie
Lights, camera, action, got a nice tasty fashion
Got some nice tasting bitches, and I like tasting bitches
And I like taking money, I don’t like taking pictures
But I like naked pictures, I saw your wife’s naked pictures
I saw your homies with the cops, and I don’t like snakes and snitches
You know it’s lonely at the top, it’s just me, kites, planes, and pigeons (hi neighbor)
It’s just me, life, rags, and riches, I didn’t have a pot or pan to piss in
Now I’m like Ice Man, I’m chilling, laying on white sand, she sniffing
Laying on satin sheets, I’m comfy, I came from the backstreets, that’s bumpy
Now I’m like Wall Street with money, and bitch don’t call me for nothing with your broke ass
Tell my niggas it’s show time, tell my bitches it’s show time
Sipping lean, I’m on a slow time, choking off the weed like it’s a bowtie
Lights, camera, action, lights, camera, action
My bitch like the camera action, just like Pamela Anderson, ohh
I tell my bitches it’s show time, I tell my niggas it’s show time
And all my niggas gon’ throw signs, we gangbanging nigga, fuck your side
Lights, camera, action, lights, camera, action
I’m the main attraction, my bitch sexy and attractive
My bitch sexy and attractive, fancy, flexible, elastic
We have sex while we in traffic, we have sex then re-enact it
She take X and she do acid, she took X amount of classes
My bitch classy and she ratchet, sassy and nasty, and romantic
My bitch sexy and attractive, she'll collect the 
And she healthy and she sweet, I eat it like vegetables and candy
My bitch sexy and she crafty, my bitch sexy wearing glasses
My bitch sexy wearing khakis, my bitch never wearing panties, no
Tell my bitches it’s show time, tell my niggas it’s show time
Tell them niggas we lit, lit like the Apollo sign
Getting money and getting so high, Versace shades, that’s 4 eyes
She suck the dick till her throat tired, I fuck the bitch till we both tired
My bitch look like Kiki Shepard, your bitch look like a German Shepard
Got 2 hoes with me, salt and pepper, and you can’t have salt without pepper
Took them to my spot like a leopard, I fucked them soon as they stepped in
Your niggas ain’t goons, they yes men, these niggas ain’t Tune, I’m special, lord
I told my niggas it’s show time, and we ain’t finished, we need more time
I just want some ass and a blowjob, my bitch want an ass and a nose job
I spent some bands on a bowtie, I give her bands, tell her “go shopping”
I need my check from my old job, I need my check from my old job
Watch out lil bitch or get clotheslined, I say “take off your clothes,” she say “sure, fine”
They say my mind is a goldmine, I say “no shit,” I say “no lie”
I’m on my shit, in control slime, I’m on my shit, I control mine
I told my bitches it’s show time, I told my niggas it’s show time
Lights, camera, action, lights, camera, action
I’m the main attraction, my bitch sexy and attractive
My bitch sexy and attractive, my bitch sexy and attractive
She say I’m sexy and I’m handsome, I got a Jet Ski and a Phantom
I got a condo and a mansion, I got a main hoe and companion
I got a plain hoe and a dancer, I got a lame hoe and a fast one
Imma finesse and pull a fast one, I got connects from here to NASA
Got a direct line on Jigga, but I don’t text or harass him
But when I do holler at him, it ain’t never about you rappers
Cuz y’all just rap about shit you never did and shit that’s never about to happen
And I’m so tired of these lil dudes, excuse me if I start napping
And then my 3 wishes was granted and that was lights, camera, action, I’m gone

We are coming for the crowns
We are kings and queens 
(Uh, yeah)
And we gon' be rich forever 
(Mula, baby)
We gon' be rich forever 
(Yeah, Mula, bae)

Rich forever, sitting on leather
If you hating god bless you like you sniffed some pepper
I'm on an island where it's quiet and the fish is speckled
With a bitch I call JJ for jiggling Jello
Lord rich forever, kiss the bezel
Rubies in the watch face, it came with the freckles
Got a black card to pay for all the incidentals
And my house so big I hear my whispers echo
Lord rich forever, forever and a day
Trying not to confuse the gas pedal with the brake
I just made a multi-million dollar settlement today
I'm talking shit, you can't imagine all the peppermints I ate
A couple hundred thousand here, it keep the federal away
A couple hundred thousand there and now I'm settling a case
Walked straight up out the Rikers like I never spent a day
And the money like pussy, it's better when you chase, lord

Gotta chase that money 
(Yeah)
Gotta chase that green 
(Woo)
We are coming for the crowns
We are kings and queens 
(Amen, yeah)
And we gon' be rich forever 
(Mula, baby, ah)
We gon' be rich forever 
(Yeah, Mula, baby)
Gotta chase that money 
(Yeah)
Gotta chase that green

We are coming for the crowns 
(Yeah)
We are kings and queens 
(Can't stop money, nigga, no you can't)
And we gon' be rich forever 
(I-I woke up this morning and I looked in the mirror and I told myself, I said Tunechi)
We gon' be rich forever 
(Mula, baby)

Rich forever, lit forever
I'm higher than pitch and treble
I just sip and I twist them pedals
My bitch is special
I stay busy, she be salty like a twisted pretzel
Lord busy schedule, misfit rebel
When the money come, the bitch sing Christmas carols
Pistol several, rich but careful
Still wondering when they gon' make a triple barrel
Got money on my mind and I don't see a limit
Tell my girl I'm coming right now, I'ma be a minute
She said ""The money more important"" and now she offended
I say ""You damn right,"" she say ""Stop agreeing with me""
Niggas copy me and mimic, they just comedy and gimmicks
Put your money where your mouth is, I'ma be the dentist
I swear I'ma get the money constantly consistent
I'll be rich forever, I'ma be a minute, yeah

No more late notices for the electric bill
No more  and we can barely get our fill
No more scraping by
No more living just to die

Gotta chase that money 
(I'm a chase it)
Gotta chase that green 
(I'm chasing, I'm chasing)
We are coming for the crowns
We are kings and queens 
(And I won't be complacent)
And we gon' be rich forever 
(Mula, baby)
We gon' be rich forever 
(Young Mula, baby)
Gotta chase that money 
(I'm chasing)
Gotta chase that green 
(I'm chasing, I'm chasing)
We are coming for the crowns
We are kings and queens

And we gon' be rich forever

Get Off the Corner,Lights Out,2000.0,"The block is hot, the cops is swarmin a neighborhood heavy
While niggas off in the neighborhood sellin, with penitentiary chances
The dope roped up in the cup of their pants
Fiends flock like spazzes come get this candy
I got heroin in bundles, them Highland O's
Plus a cooked slab, chopped up, dimes is swoll
If I spot the law's comin', hey, it's time to roll
Candy Carter got a line of parole, out of control
The first fell a Tuesday this month oh sweet thang
Plus it's a sweet day, me next score for three days
One time they say what you mean, I gets the green
Break up the block like Maurice Green, ya feel me?
In my predicament I'm guilty until proven innocent
Hustle ridiculous, I'm tryin to get this dope continuos
Ball til I fall, one thing, I ain't tryin to fall
Want everybody numb like anbesol

Like fuck that nigga, I let my pump subtract niggas
You beef with me I guarantee your mams be missin
With a note behind demandin three chickens or she gets it
Do not twist it because lil man is trippin
They could have ya body in three different places
Ain't nothin gravy, but save it
Cause I'm a ride and hit the nigga street
Weezy go to war like Sadaam and Clinton disagree
While I'm shitty from the weed
Like were them bustas be
I promise ya never fuckin sleep, I clear the set
Come outside late at night to your surprise I'm here with Tec's
Two shots knock off the niggas necks, it's so realistic

And the law don't bother me, I give the pigs a couple of G's
Shit, I hustle strong to push this work through the streets
I'm tryin to deal with every nigga, and sell the birds up cheap
I'm greedy, if there's any money bein made from drugs I need it
Twenty bricks two weeks completed, you can't beat it

Shoot at the driver side knock his body to the backseat

Di-diamonds and —

Get 'em
Like five, six chains on
Slick Rick, no patch just frames on
Marc Jacobs Aviators and a V-neck
Ten bitches, ten pistols on the P-jet
In a drop top Madina with the top up
I'm in that bitch getting neck like a shot put
Hundred thousand for the grill, if I lie, I die
Flow sick, so sick, see the cyanide
And here's my most funniest joke: I'm broke
Don't worry 'bout me, the money got me
And I keep the burner on me like an I.D
The Lamborghini orange like vitamin C
And leave a bitch stuck like a kite in a tree
Weezy F.B., the money is the matter
I'm working like a bad bladder, M.O.B


Hailing from the bottom of the map
But standing at the top of the game
Kush got a nigga looking like I could really use a nap
But I'm still out wildin' with the gang
Got diamonds in my chain, more colors than the Northern Lights
Life is a traffic jam but I'm on a motor bike
Zig-zagging past these bastards, laughing at them
I got them suicidal like the doors on the Phantom
Yeah, hot spitter nigga, who you thought it was
Bitches want to hold me in the morning like a coffee mug
I don't try to lock them down cause I am not an officer
I just knock them down in groups of ten
As if I'm in the lane aiming for bowling pins
Then the style switch so quick
Have you thinking that the disc skipped
Pimping serious
Make them bring it back like pass interferance
 (x2)

Speed boat, wife-beater
Ballin' like Derek Jeter for every reason
That Testarossa can get ghost like it never seen ya
The same color as sesame-a, diarrhea
The pioneer-a, I am here-a, right here-a
The watch nasty like gonorrhea
Money long like Nia, I appear-a via satellite
Whomever don't like the premiere, he a hermaphrodite
Vegetables up in my ear-a, get it clear
Pretty women want this nigga right here-a like Richard Gere
I switch the gear, and steer and disappear
And if I ever jump off a pier I would probably fly

We talked about love and shit
She looked me in my eyes
And said the next dick she take would be her husband's dick, damn
See, I had the steak
She had the lobster
I say, ""I want you on my team""
She say, ""I don't join rosters""
Oh, believe dat
And then the drinks came
And then the mood changed
And then her answer switched
She let her hair down
And lit a cancer stick
She saw it turn me off
And said she tryna quit
She went to the ladies room
And I hopped on my phone
Most likely she doin' the same thing

Like, ""Girl, what you think?
Um, should I do it?""
She say, ""Shit, I don't know
You know these niggas, he probably used to it""
Her other friend grabbed the phone and said, ""That bitch just hatin', you better fuck that nigga
That bitch just hatin', you better fuck that nigga""
And then she said, ""If you do, you better fuck him good
'Cause if another bitch could, she gon' f—""

We had dinner, we talked about the future
She said I could have chose any bitch, I would beg to differ
But beggars can't be choosers, yeah, hm
And see, I had the shrimp, she had the pasta
She say she don't like rappers, we got something in common
I said, ""Especially that nigga Wayne""
We both laughed and then the wine came
And then her mind changed
She loosened up her blouse, her smirks turn to smiles
It was a full moon when she turned around
She used my restroom, she say, ""You know, girl stuff""
She left the water runnin' and hit her girl up

Like, ""What you think?"" (Ha-ha-ha)
""Should I do it?""

We fucked all night long and shit
We fell asleep naked
So when we woke up, she wanted that morning dick (I gave it to her too, hm, yeah)
I had the grits, she had the waffles
She say she drank too much last night, and I should have stopped her
I say, ""Believe that""
And then my phone rang
She saw my girl name
And then her world changed
She put her clothes on and said, ""I'm going home, Wayne""
I said, ""Lisa, chill""
And that was the wrong name
She hit her girl up and said, ""I hate rappers""
And then her girl laughed and said, ""Bitch, what happened?""

And she said, ""What you think?
Fuck, why did I do it?
Bitch, I bet that nigga knew he was gon' fuck from 'Hi, how you doing""

Someone to close his heart
Someone to die for you and more

Okay, come be my appetizer
My fruit, my apple cider, my colada

I told him don't bring me a plate
If it don't have a rapper on it
Chef Angel on the beat
And me I'm just snackin' on it

Bowl of french of fries
Tell 'em bitches bonjour

Finger lickin' good never been a thumb sucker
I eat your ass good, never leave a crumb sucka
Never been a club hopper I'm a club jumper
That mean I get the club jumpin', I'm grubbin
Rappers say, ""Hello Wayne"", I reply, ""What up supper?""
I could fry your ass up a saute
Marinade ya all day
I like my shit saute
'Cause all the rappers salty
'Cause all the rappers fault me
For bein' the best of all thee
Rappers call on me
'Cause I'm the best rapper rappin'
Rappers you can call me
The best rapper rappin'
I'm a dog I'm a beast
I'm a feast
Carter get it in order
Order me I oughta be an artery
'Cause I'm a bloody buzzin' B
I'm a beast I at least
Should get a piece of that pie
Before I die
Because I if no one else deserve
Now where is my dessert?

And now for dessert...

Yes, this is dessert
For his and hers
I'll take his her
Kiss her
Make her pussy purr
Wet zipper
Never tip her
Never fall in love with a stripper
Like strawberries, I dip her
In whip cream, I whip her
I let her melt, then sip her
Like sizzurp, I'm tryna quit the sizzurp
'Cause moms say quit the sizzurp
But my auntie mom trippin', she a tripper
And I can eat you quicker
But I'm gonna take my time with it
Like a 3 legged cake I gotta climb in it
But ain't shit sweet when I'm in it
When I'm in it, I told her you gonna miss me
If I hit it
I'm done with it
And can't nobody else  do what I done with it
Not what I done did it

I prolong, and hold on
To it like a trombone, I'm so blown
And um, I got that cock back, I don't need that thumb bone
So come on, you get the one with the drum on, it
That's that one that goes dit, dit dit dit dit dit dit dit
I'm so terrific when I spit, put my foot up in your ass
Now I'm kickin in your shit
Now I'm pitchin at your bitch
And she catch it with her lip, naw she catch it wit her mouth
And since im the president, she tried to catch it on her blouse
I tell her whoa, easy baby
I'm king cake, so she eat the baby
Wait, shit gets way more crazier
We flipped the bitch like she was in the gymnasium
I ain't fuckin with them bitches with that stadium
Thats no dome, bitch go home... b bi bitch, bitch go home

Bitch I spent a hundred winters on my snow cone
Lil nigga walking like he get his bowl on
Boss man, pimp stroll, pimp stroll
I can let my money go when the wind blow
Bet it come right back like a rental
And bet them bitches understand me like 10-4
Niggas is simple, like instrumentals
I bet you bitches understand me like info
Get your top chopped, and get trimmed low
Sumn like my Benzo
Riding with my friends hoes
No I mean my hoes friends
Fucking all my hoes friends
Takin all my hoes ends, that what make the globe spin
I tell these young niggas; pimp or die
Dont get that Benz, if they dont split them i's
Dig them thighs, thin them ties
And if you reach at I
I don't preach I speech and give you beef wit them fries
Come to the beach and find
I live where all the little seagulls fly
See, baby I'm so high
All I need you to do is just shut up and ride
Bitch bitch shut up and ride

Look, and me and Mac was just two niggas from the same hood
Fell from the same tree, cut from the same wool
I'm just the lion and he the young bull
Not Sammy the bull
That pistol on my hip then I got a hammy to pull
I had a Lammy in school, I think it was diablo red
I'm T.I. red, I'm t.i.red, you d.i.ed because of what you said
Chea, I'm as sharp as an image
And I keep it bumpin like a motherfuckin blemish
Two twins drink me up like Guinness
When I'm finished I say ""Brilliant!""
When I'm finished they say ""Weezy you killed it""
I hop on your shit and they say ""Weezy you healed it""
So fly, got wings tattooed on me, the gun glued on me

They made fun of me cause I was a odd fellow
See I was half skate park I was half ghetto

Beef with me, you're swimmin' in water with sharks and piranhas
Revolvers and choppers got all your partners callin' the coppers
And for the grand finale, I might pull up in a tan Denali
When I hop out, in my hand is a Calico sprayin' your family

Don't play with me - I wish you would
I'ma hit your hood, then split your hood
You bet' not play with me cause I cock my gun
I pop my gun
Better hide and run
Niggas bet' not play with me cause I wish you would
I'ma hit your hood, then split your hood
Niggas bet' not play with me cause I cock my gun
And I pop my gun
Better hide and run

What is this that done got me in your district? Twist it
Now everybody got dots on they heads like Egyptians
I'm tipsy - I've been sippin' on that Hennessy, people
Then it get deeper, I start shootin' up innocent people
Seventeen Creeper is who I - what I - be, dog
The clip slide in the four-five, then it blow five
In heat, dog? It's your life or me, dog
On four tires, or feet, dog
I still be on the block sweepin'
Nobody is not sleepin'
Got me in all black with a gun in a palm
Run in his home, start shootin', hit his son in the dome
Dummy, it's on - ain't gon' be no relaxin' and stuff
Cause when I come through mashin' the truck, I'm blastin' a pump
And passin' a blunt - me circle once to see if he dead
Gotta be sure cause niggas promised me a ki if he dead
But, dog, you get it raw if you war with the kid
I'll push your baby momma car off the bridge
Huh?!

Don't play with me - I wish you would
I'ma hit your hood, then split your hood
You bet' not play with me cause I cock my gun
I pop my gun
Better hide and run
Niggas bet' not play with me cause I wish you would
I'ma hit your hood, then split your hood
Niggas bet' not play with me cause I cock my gun
And I pop my gun
Better hide and run

You might catch me with bandanas and strapped T
On the back street of your block in the back seat
I'mma cap three at the first coward I up and see
I'mma bust the piece and knock his body a couple of feet
When I rush your front door, you get a few to your stomach
Hope they dress you up nice because your funeral Sunday
Nigga shouldn't've played tough - wouldn't've got his head bust
Now your whole livin' room is full of pink and red stuff
Now you're gatted up, full of that vodka and weed added up
Fresh platted up, your T-shirt all tatted up
Crack in the tongue of my kicks
Plus I got a gun on my hip, and I'm runnin' the strip
I know you see me: Little Weezy kill 'em all easy
A hundred rounds from the chopper leave 'em real sleepy
You know how we be smellin' weedy up in our clothes
Cutthroatin', connivin' killers, but that's all I know
Huh? Huh? Huh?

Don't play with me - I wish you would
I'ma hit your hood, then split your hood
You bet' not play with me cause I cock my gun
I pop my gun
Better hide and run
Niggas bet' not play with me cause I wish you would
I'ma hit your hood, then split your hood
Niggas bet' not play with me cause I cock my gun
And I pop my gun
Better hide and run
Don't play with me - I wish you would
I'ma hit your hood, then split your hood
You bet' not play with me cause I cock my gun
I pop my gun
Better hide and run
Niggas bet' not play with me cause I wish you would
I'ma hit your hood, then split your hood
Niggas bet' not play with me cause I cock my gun
And I pop my gun
Better hide and run
Don't play with me - I wish you would
I'ma hit your hood, then split your hood
You bet' not play with me cause I cock my gun
I pop my gun

"Her, Him, & Me",I Can’t Feel My Face-Off,2002,"What's up
It's me
Yep, uhm
I've had plenty episodes with various women, but it's just this one I must tell you about...

I met her in Victoria's
She was hotter than a crown victoria
On my block on a friday at 6:00 yep
I was on her yung joc
She made me lean and rock
I tried to tell her my name but laughed more so
Because she looked like tell me somethin I don't kno
So I told her my number and I got hers also
And of course she knew I had a girl, I wouldn't be in the store
So we hooked up that morning like around 4
And at that time I knew what she was down for
Yep
Soon as the door opened, war opened out
She was such a soldier, purple heart pokin out of her fatigues, and she's never fatigued
And with her, whatever I say she believes
And my girl know I got a magic show up my sleeve
But with her, I can disappear when I need
And she say...

She don't even care about my girlfriend
She said she just wanna do the thang with me
And who am I to tell that girl no when this world is so cold, why should I be
Shit
And she don't even wanna be my girlfriend
She said she just wanna do her thang with me
And she gonna do her thang with me, with me

(let me tell you bout this bitch I got tho)
I met this bad bitch last month
Bona fide freak, we been kickin it for the past month
Or should I say I been hittin it for the past month
David blaine, magic stickin it for the last month
She got that coke bottle ill shape
Thicker than a McDonald's milkshake
We don't go on dates, we have field days
She let me play on her field like a bill's game
And she don't even like football, she just sits home
But she love it when I run it in her inzone
She love to role play and put them wigs on
Yeah, she be gettin her lil' kim on
With me, she can be as freaky as she is, but with him she gotta be as sneaky as she is
And with her, I can be as kinky as I'm gonna be
Upside down, handstand's how I wanna be
She said...

She don't even care about her boyfriend
She said she just wanna do the thang with a g
And who is he to tell that girl no when this world is so cold, why should he be
Shit
And she don't want him to be her boyfriend
She said she just wanna do her thang with a g
And she gonna do her thang with a g, with a g

Chillin by Elz
And we smoked a hundred L
We spoke about gals
We joked about tales
No homo
But I meant like a storytale
Ya dig

Let me tell you bout this bitch name Loreal
Light skin, long hair
I call her slaughter mouth
Thick and juicy like steak meat, porterhouse
And bein freaky is somethin she knows all about
She keep askin me if we can put a porno out

I know that bitch too
I say we give her a call
And see what that bitch do

You got that bitch number
Well call that bitch through
I got the rubbers
Got the dutches
Hell yeah, we can jump her
Ya dig

Yeah, hello
Hey mama, wat up?
How you?
Yeah this weezy
Hey listen, I got Elz right here with me
We bout to come pick you up
That's cool?
Cool, we good
Yessir

She don't even do this with her boyfriend
She said she just wanna do the thang with him and me
And who are we to tell that girl no when this world is so cold, why should we be
Shit
She said she would even do my girlfriend
She said she just wanna do her thang, be free
She said she just wanna do her thang, be free
Her, him, and me",https://genius.com/Lil-wayne-her-him-and-me-lyrics

Let's make a Princess
And you know time is money, time to invest
Talkin’ shit to her, without bad breath
Told her ""I could take you there without MapQuest""
Thinking ""Should I fall back, or forward progress?""
You know love is hard to swallow, and digest
Pause
She gon' have to take my love from me
But if I fall for her, you could call me clumsy
If I hit it and crash, I'm a crash dummy
I might just eat her up, I got an empty stomach
And you know drinking is bad, on an empty stomach
So we both get drunk, and just eat each other
We in the bedroom, I guess it’s one of those
I think you overdressed, in your underclothes
I confess to you, give my best to you
I told my last name, I'm tryna give an S to you
I think you a beast, without a leash
You could ride me, baby, like I'm the streets
I got a black eye, from your heartbeat
Make me change my lifestyle, call Robin Leach
I'm ready

I'm ready, (you know I'm ready)
To love you (to love you)

Hey love now
Come and love me forever more

Yeah, we just thuggin, illin'
Puffin, chillin' on some shit that make us touch the ceilin’
If it’s just a feel feelin, what a feelin'
We invest in power, we progress like flowers
We’re in love, now we need something else to conquer
We go Casablanca, I'm your vagina monster
You know I get in that pussy and go Waka Flocka
Sexual healing, you know I'm your doctor
I'm a kill it, and I hit you with that Johnny Cochran
I’m the hottest topic, when you and your girlfriend talkin'
Tell her how I knock it, until we exhausted
You give me sloppy toppy, I eat it till I'm nauseous
I beat it like percussion, the neighbors think we arguing
Cupid hit the target, we use the whole apartment
They knockin' at the door, and she answer that bitch naked
She make me get an erection in a split second
She do tricks with her tongue, they so impressive
Am I trickin' too? um, that's a trick question
She asked me am I finna cum, that's a dick question
And she ain't fuckin' with you bums, give her indigestion
Can't you tell I've been ready?

Cap & Gown,Unreleased Songs,2018,"Oh my goodness
Uh

I turned my mansion to a juug house
I did a TV show with Jesse off of Full House
Oh lord, I turned my mansion to a ho house
I did a show way in Haiti, bought the Zoes out
I rolls out in the car with the head missing, the hoes out
Closed mouth, don't get fed shit in the cold drought
Old south habits, I pour it up, you pour it out
I left the court house with a stroll, bounce and no doubt
I know I'm no slouch if Hov vouch, my doors sprout
I help my bro out and get him out the dope house
I never sold loud since that old couch that fold out
Like the pronounce that I am on a whole ounce
Stank so loud like old trout and toes out
Make these hoes crouch, then roll, bounce, then roll out
And kick rocks, I started with six rocks, oh lord (Woo)
Let it breathe
I started off with six rocks
Made 30 dollars, thank god for hip hop
Didn't stop, I was gettin' guap, gotta diddy bop
And hit the block with my palms itching like chicken pox
Bop jiggy bop, my niggas hot, my bitch a fox
All you niggas mock, you bit my swag like little crocks
Don't give diddly squat 'bout any man or city cops
Pistol in my sock, no lollipops, we lickin' shots
Moms cooked dinner and then the pots went to my pops
He was whippin' rock around the clock, oh, how I watched
Then I got shot and then I dropped, then went in shock
Laid up in that hospital room, soon as the doctor knock
You know I hopped up, bounced back like boom shakala
Got rich at 15 and moved momma out
Got lit at 15, ooh, cotton mouth
Started off with six rocks, it's a mountain now
Ooh, and I ain't climbin' down
I never been a fan of common grounds
I been gettin' green since Bobby Brown
Been meaning to write my wrongs, but I been too busy to jot 'em down
And when you visit, I'm not around
I hope your view isn't from out of bounds
I come to do business, so for your new niggas disguising frowns
When your crew fishing, your body's found
Oh lord, I turned my mansion to the White House
Did a movie with Forest Whittaker, got my lines down
Ooh, but my mansion still a ho house
Did a show at home, bought my bros and no foes out
I rolls out in the coupe with the doors out, the whores out
My flow is like a shoe with the soles out, Dr. Scholl's vouch
I knows how to move with my nose down
Keep my nose out of people business, news and hoes' mouth 'cause these hoes foul
My pops from the goose, I'm from Eagle Street, Hollygrove child
I used to have the Nissan with Bose sound, I drove around
Chrome 44 with the gold snout, take your crown
Extended clip that poke out, reload rounds
Sex with a bitch, deep stroke, ouch, she so aroused
Next to the bitch is a coke pile, your hoes mouth
Mine goes down, swallows child with no chow
That mean no teeth, holy cow, slow it down
Yeah, I guess I'm hoin' now
I never been a fan of knowin' vows
I been gettin' green, I mean more than cows
Been meaning to settle down, but I be jugglin' hoes like a clown
And if she gullible, I like her style
If she bisexual, I dyke her out
And if she flexible, if she flexible, I'll wrap her 'round
Get head and pussy, call it cap and gown
Oh lord

No ceilings
No feelings
You all in your feelings
I'm like fuck your feelings

Damn, I fuck with ya for that
I fuck with ya Lil Wack
And me and Skip go back
When you see a real nigga you gotta tip your hat
And since I'm a real nigga, I do just that
I had my own lawyer working on Turk's case
After I heard him dissing me on the mixtape
'Cause he's locked up and I'm free
He got a lot more to worry about than me
I ain't trippin'

Y'all niggas left me by myself, but I can't front
(I like it)
And so, now I became the President
Of the spot y'all left me at
A lot has changed, but, I can't front

In the kitchen tryin' make a 20 turn in to a 100 (yea)
The pot runnin over wit hot water
Throw a 8 ball in it watch it come back harder (harder)
The come back kid come back carter yea
That's what they screamin' loud as Aretha
And for them Franklins we pop at the ceaser
Ridin round with the whole block with the speakers (yea)
We in Miami we stoppin at teasers (yea)
Have a cigar and a shot of tequila (patron)
I use to wear two socks with my sneakers (hey)
Back when i was puttin all my rocks in my sneakers
Yea but now i'm rockin ya speakers

And for the rest his life we keep an eye on 'em
Bussiness bad, fuck you pay me
Oh you had a fire, fuck u pay me
I'm might run through 80 in a week
But i can make a quarter million dollars off 1 street
Top in the game off one feet
Then i landed on two and i walked on through
What can you do when you living like me
Get fly in the house leave the pimpin in the street
As quiet as a mouse when you dippin through the street
If you lookin for some work you probably run into me
And on the humble the number still cheap
But the judge got numbers for a nigga to steep
Yea from a youngin to a g

Never Really Mattered,Tha Carter V (2014 Version),2019,"[Intro: Lil Wayne & 
Birdman

80s and 90s money, boy
Money
Just ball, baby, just ball, baby
Ain't nothing to me
Money ain't never been nothing to me
You understand me?
Ain't nothing to me
Ain't nothing to me
Spend as much as you feel baby
I told the bitch it's just money
[Chorus: Lil Wayne & 
INOJ
]
It never really mattered too much to me, to me
Jesus saves, I spend it, nigga
It never really mattered too much to me, to me
I told the bitch it's just money
It never really mattered too much to me, to me
Jesus saves, I spend it, nigga
It never really mattered too much to me, to me
Yeah

I'm about to start using hundred dollar bills to twist a kill, that's for real
We've been on the road to riches, I told Stunna pass the wheel
Man, I just bought a painting for half a mill, that's a steal
Shit, when I'm an artist myself for crying out loud, that's a tear
In a backyard, where the dog at? Driveway where the hogs at?
Can't beat this shit, nigga, Lord knows I fought back, I fought back
We live nigga, let's broadcast, you caught that
New car get brought back if that motherfucker don't haul ass
I swear I had a Lexus coupe, it was Pepsi blue
It was shockingly gorgeous, it was electro-cute
I need a screw, the loose change extra loose
I just give my bitch some loot, that shit like pressing mute, fuck it

Ain't nothing to me, money don't mean nothing to me
It ain't nothing to me
I told the bitch it's just money
It never really mattered too much to me, to me
You understand me, love? You can take this jet
I know you ain't been out your neighborhood
Jesus saves, I spend it, nigga
It never really mattered too much to me, to me
You understand me? We going to another country with this chopper, this is ballin'
Yeah
You understand me? Blow a quarter mill

I'ma park my Royce on the grass at your bitch house
Talk that shit, I'm shit-mouth
I flip this money, baby
Watch that perfect dismount
I say thank God all my bills paid
Knock on wood, my mama good
Knock twice 'cause she gave me life
Don't forget that, your honor could
Man, niggas be jacking these days
Only thief I know is Robbin Hood
But I'll pay for that trial nigga
Gotta protect my lively-hood
Look at all the bullshit I've endured
My lawyer said I matured
Talking 'bout them dead presidents
Breath smell like embalming fluid

Vacation, vacation
Keep the weed in rotation
Don't give up the location
I'll send you back to population
Man, I feel like making donations
And I don't need no standing ovations
I bought my bitch some new shit
And told her I don't care if you break it, it's just money

It ain't nothing to me, money don't mean nothing to me
It ain't nothing to me
I told the bitch it's just money
It never really mattered too much to me, to me
You understand me, baby girl? You don't have no worries no more when you fuckin' with this
Jesus saves, I spend it, nigga
Money's never a problem
It never really mattered too much to me, to me
[Verse 3: Lil Wayne 
with Birdman

I got money to burn, fire hazards
Lil Tune the monsoon
Cash Money 
mascot, it's hot under this costume
Got rugs I never stepped on
Beds I never effed on
I'm in that upper echelon
Your empty pockets echoing
I still ride for my niggas
Money don't change a gangster
And when I'm asked to pull a few strings
I pull 'em until they untangle
And I like nice things and bad bitches with cab fare
More money, more problems
I'm surprised I still got black hair

I feel like a vacation, vacation
We gon' need vaccination
Don't give up the destination
I'll send you back to population
Man, let's leave out our situations
Leave our tribulations
I got old money, generations
Where's my cheque book? I'm spending pages, it's just money

Birdman

It never really mattered too much to me, to me
Some niggas might call it trickin', we call it takin' care of your broad
Jesus saves, I spend it, nigga, yeah
It never really mattered too much to me, to me
I told the bitch it's just money
It never really mattered too much to me, to me
I swear to God we gon' ride high, and stay fly, and stay high
Yeah, yeah, yeah, money don't mean nothing to me
You understand me, baby?
It never really mattered too much to me, to me
Ain't nothing, money don't mean nothing to me (Money, money)
It ain't nothing to me
Just ball, baby, just ball, baby
[Outro: Lil Wayne & 
Birdman

It don't mean nothing
I already paid that price
Money don't mean nothing
We do this shit every night
Yoppas in the middle of the ocean
Helipads, chefs
You understand me?

The mall will come to us

Leanin’ Low,The Leak 5,UnKnown,"{LIl Wayne- Verse 1}
Im walkin thru the street
Wit 24s on my feet
A nigga got whips
Like a farmer got sheep
And as a matter fact
I got sheeps like a farmer man
I ain't playin
I jus bought a brand new lamb
T tops like a old trans am
Pull up at the light on a bitch like BAM
N from the side view she still kno who I am
A smokin nigga and bobbin my head to my jam
Im prolly on that deaf
Im prolly on that cam
All pink diamonds lookin like spam
All white porshe lookin like the clam
All white seats lookin like a gram
You cannot stop a flow
Not even wit a dam
Im fresher than a mufucka
Cleaner than a sham
And a bitch couldn't pass me
If she crammed
An what I am im (im sittin on 24's)

Six speed coupes the only thing that the boy order
Im paid n full so im stuntin like rich porter
Y pull up 2 the club in a charger
When I can pull up in a damn super charger
No tints chromed out chub super larger
My money sittin high
Ya money leanin low
U need 2 play the lotto
Cuz u need the dough
C ya in the lotta
Cuz I b the dough
Artermarv standout like a pornstar
My maserati roxy reynolds thats my porn car
So take ya top off
And ya bra off while I wait to the telly right here it pop off
And to the dealer n drop that loot
500 cash on drop and coupe
And shorty that im wit yea she drop dead cute
But she kno that my coupe is (sittin on 24's)

I told ya
I roll on dub
4's
N I gets much love
Red diamonds on me
The color of cold blood
White diamonds on me
The color of soap sudds
Light brown leather like im sittin on mud
We might bust caps
But we never ride hubbs
Pocket full of leaf
Car full of wood like im ridin in a tree
But im higher than a tree
I ain't flyer than a bird
But im ridin on a wing
And a bird can fly until u can't see his wings (haha)
Big car
Big rims
Sucker what
Lips pokin out
Look like they puckered up (Gimme Kiss)
N I b ridin by myslf
Leanin so low you think my car was drivin by itself
N when I sail through the street
I do it bigger than Shaquille O'neal's feet (sittin on 24's)",https://genius.com/Lil-wayne-leanin-low-lyrics

Say it's cool, you can believe me, I like how they treat me
I'm doin' what ya say, don't let a nigga try me
And I don't let a fine, pretty broad get by me
Don't let nothin' pull me off track from my hobby
Oh yeah, and I don't leave my room sloppy
But the same thang make ya laugh, make ya cry
And everybody that ya love it's like they have to die
I pray to the Lord everyday and ask him why
And ask him to bless your soul everytime I pass by
I know he doin' it, and leavin all the love to me

Suffix, people
Chyeah
You know
You, you, you already
Yeah
C'mon

Kicking rocks on the block, telling all the OGs
""I be coming for your spot when you're not looking""
Hot cooking, mama got it on the kitchen table
I thank God we were always able to
Get the leather couch, big screen, cable too
Nintendo when them good grades came through
Then the cooked Ks came through
Some soft, some stepped-on, but we kept on
And I slept with the work plenty nights
Thought I heard niggas coming, thought I saw the cop lights, but
I was dreaming, then I woke
The junkies was still fiending, and I had coke so
I had hope; you may say that its wrong
But I ain't talking to your child, I'm talking to this song
I'm just doing a buck down memory lane
If I crash, just pick up my brain
And yes, my niggas the same, but they quicker to bang
And if they do, then I'm the nigga you blame
So I shoot first anyway, and I would do the honors any day
And tell your honor he a bitch to his face
And whip through the stage like I whip through the yay
Show your ass how to take four and get eight
And it don't take four niggas to get straight
The only Hot Boy eating off this plate: Young
Weezy Baby, that's what your bitch say
Give her ass a location and a template
Show her how to work the interstate
Stop working with that thinner weight, get your brakes fixed
Stop playing, 'cause all we know is gunplay
Trip while you full and my clip gon' be empty
When the stomachs get empty, anything's tempting
Ain't nobody safe when it's for the kids' sake
Hurricane wiped us out like a earthquake
We tryna save face, but we ain't got a place
To stay, so they made us evacuate
We on our way, pussies, relocate
Y'all know us, when you see us, put your jewels up
Put your cars, put your clothes, put your shoes up
It's that serious, homie, pick the news up
It wasn't good, nigga, think about the hood, nigga
The people who ain't never had shit, ain't gon' never have shit
Bullshit, 'cause they still gon' try to manage
Niggas doing anything, like, God gon' understand 'em
But please understand this: niggas with money lost mansions
Niggas with nothing lost families, lives lost in traffic
Water up to the attic, there goes the stashes
But a nigga got passion
Even though the bounce-back seeming like magic
Shit... Well, call me Siegfried
Watch how I turn one key to a hundred Gs
Yeah, dear summer, summer breeze:
Summer, please, know I live for you
Throw on the wife-beater, let back the lid for you
A few years I probably hear from you, but now I'm here for you
I know niggas that shed a tear for you
Behind bars, tryna get to you, and probably never see you
This that real talk if you ever heard it, homie
Shit hurts so much, might have to hurt you, homie
No commercial, no fronting, no curve on it
No cut; tell life, ""So what?""
The drought's here; not only white's slowed up
The weed's slowed up, we can't even roll up
Fuck it, put a dent in the money too
But that's the last thing 'cause hustle is what we do
Hustle with what? How we getting on?
Where he sitting at? What he sitting on?
Stand up if you know it's true
The end of the world coming, and my city the proof, damn
Shit... And this is after disaster
This ain't rap, this a recap
Stepping off the G4, still strapped
Bust your head in the air, that's a sky-cap
Have my car pick me up where I arrive at
Drop the work off, 'cause it don't go where I reside at
Garbage bags filled up with dollars
Dead presidents, gotta dump the bodies
Birdman, as long as we gon' eat
Then everybody eat off me
Feet off ground, fingers to the stars, reaching
And I'ma get there through these bars, believe me
I'm down for the cause, even
When everything pause, I'm proceeding
I'm a leader, meet the son of Jacida

I ain't thinkin' normally, nigga
Bring a tank and all of that with you (Come on)
Cause you know I'm from New Orleans, nigga
All I gotta do is just borrow, no limits
Cutting up in a brand new Ferrari my nigga
I'ma get one for all of my niggas
You know I influenced all of these niggas
I just see y'all as my minions
I just see y'all in my menu
I just see y'all as civilians
I don't see y'all as competition
I can see God when I'm squinting
I can't see y'all in my position
I can't see y'all from my condition
I'm wasted
Pill poppin' and pacing (Yeah)
Prescription medications
Like redemption, revelation (Yeah)
She pill poppin' and naked (Ooh)
How can you blame her, she waiting for it to kick in
I kick back when it kick in and let her do what she came for
He don't let her do what she made for and that's messed up

And it ain't trickin' if you got it, nigga
I do all these tricks, I'm a skater
It's all about money and power, nigga
The pussy and shit gon come later (Yeah)
No time for drama on my conscience
And my shoulders too small to put weight on
And my hoes take too long just to wait on
In the bathroom putting her face on
She say my pole just too long to put bait on (Yeah)
These niggas be getting their  on and that's cold (Yeah)

This here's real man
Harsh but hard
If you can't take it
You damn sure can't take the weight

Momma had to hustle cause my pop was jive
Momma had 1 son 2 jobs
What a woman! Come from where the women gotta work like men
So we ain't need dad we got money like him
No school clothes no child support
And next year I'll probably be up in a Robb Report
I'm important so is my clique I'm riding for them
God lead us not into dividing waters
Guide my daughter see that she walk a straight one
Them fake guys, please see that she don't date one
I live positive stay away from snitches, haters and broke niggas with they face hung
All the folks are ready for whenever that day come
Got a cool two million hiding until that case comes see me just a a riding to the bass drum
So if you feel me put ya blunts in the air
And blaze one and don't cry

(I,I,I, don't want you to see me cry)
Pass the weed lemme take it to the head
Hope the smoke turn my eyes red, my eyes red cause
(I,I,I, don't want you to see me cry)
And if you happen to see a tear that don't mean I'm afraid baby I'm just a man

Pass the weed lemme take it to the head
Hope the smoke turn my eyes red, my eyes red cause

I'm on the grind like all the time
I got money but murder don't cost a dime
So I'm flossing mine and if jacking me cross ya mind you done lost ya mind
All sorts and kinds of car jewels clothing
I'm looking like a porcupine
How sharp am I?
But niggas wanna bring out the dark in I
But me I'm so bright I keep walking by
Keep barking hater yeah ya talk a lot but me I'm at the top and I ain't talking down
Man they acting like they don't know I'm from Apple & Eagle
But the eagle will bust ya apple fo sho
So I'm gonna let it rock
Until they let Bubba out the cell block
Ima hold it down let the whole bottles pop
And light the weed up
Straighten ya collar
Fix ya G up and don't cry!

Pass the weed lemme take it to the head

And if you happen to see a tear that don't mean I'm afraid baby I'm just a man and
(I,I,I, don't want you to see me cry)
I remember the look on your face momma when them doctors told you I made it your son is gonna be aight he made it
I remembered then they come in there and they asked me did I wanna see you
I told them no
I was only scared
This some crazy shit
(I,I,I, don't want you to see me cry)

I got shot when I was 12
Lost my pop when I was 14
Shot again at 20 will I shake these old dreams
Lord wake me up to holy water on my face and 3 blood drops dried on the side of my eyes
Why we gotta kill our own kind when we rise
Got me looking down the ladder now when I climb
Pulling up on my nephews
And they don't wanna drive
They wanna learn how to work the tool
And who am I not to do the duty
Just think if pops advice get sent from black ink
And that stinks but homie that's real
And in the hood even steaks smell bad on the grill
I remember when if you was a hustler you was a winner
Now that's like raking up leaves in the winter
And that ain't even cool to miss a few summers
Shit
I'll take a bite out the onion like
Fuck it!
(I,I,I, don't want you to see me cry)
And won't cry

Pass the weed lemme take it to the head
Hope the smoke turn my eyes red, my eyes red cause

And straight level vodka's the potion, makes me spill my emotion and

From stuffing rocks in my ho lil bra, stash
From in her purse to in her house, yeah

AK with the telescope, filet with a cherry coke
Enjoying the fruits of my labor, I pop that cherry hoe
Kush loud as a stereo, I got all these medicals
Powder bags of heavy snow, Eskimo, I'm askin' more
All that gas like Texico, all that ass you sexy ho
To my white girl, to my weed, that Mary Jane, that Mary Joe
Private planes and heavy doors, meeting bitches in metaphors
Like these singers poor like Singapore
From heaven's gates to the devil's doors
I'm joog, I'm hustling baby
All my money, I custom-made it
Numbers don't lie but people do
That's why they turn their back on you like 180
Degrees, please, I run with Gs
They got my back, I front me some keys
I smell a rat, they stunk up the streets
Now my peeps 'bout to come with them pumps, like Febreze

Joog in a hundred degrees
Joog in the cold winter breeze
This yayo almost to my knees
I play in the snow til I freeze
She play with the snow til she sneeze
She way up, she in the nosebleeds

Just made another bitch love the dick
Just made another bitch cum cum
Who the motherfucker? I'm the motherfucker (Me)
Here come the undercovers, better run for cover
And when we under pressure we get overheated
And we overheated we turn on the army
And bring a hurricane to a thunderstorm
And leave your block looking like a slumber party
Too much stashed in my undergarments
Too much cash, that's an understatement
Too many hoes I could understand
But I'm losing all my wars to the undertaker
And I'm 'bout to make these hoes shake their money maker
And I fuck a bitch til she making funny faces
Jooging like that motherfucker Freddy Krueger
I'm jooging like that crazy motherfucker Jason
I'm jooging, these other niggas jig
You see not me, I joog, drive horses in that hood
Come through that bitch like vroom, vroom

Pistol On My Side (P.O.M.S),UnKnown,2018.0,"Me and the twin ninas have menage ??
Pistol on my side, don't come at me sideways
When the 5 sprays, he paralyzed (Bye Legs)
Bust til' the Glock hot enough to cook fried eggs
Most niggas my age been stopped liking rap
When they found out them niggas rappin, ain't write them raps
And they ghost writer ain't write it, that nigga typed them raps
In his phone, text it to holmes and he recite them raps
But on any type of track, I go dummy on it
The game dumbin down cause a bunch of dummies doin it
My weed got somethin' funny on it..
It make you feel a lil weezy, so they spendin cash money on it
You see me baby out here chasin the check
But you can go from makin connects to makin collects
If you rappin,  hear me rap it..  it can make you depressed
Cause you tryna be street that don't make you the best
It's some shit holmes said I can't wait to address
I'm the greatest I should ghostwrite for Drake and Em next
I'm so nice I can make them upset, but I dont give a hell
Louder guns, longer clips, bigger shells
So the hole big as hell when I smoke shit
Ha, me if I let the tommy hit you, you a ghost bitch
I did my own remix cause this dope Swizz
I roast this, I can't wait to post this..... BARS

Pistol on my side, trigger finger on the job
Pistol on my side, trigger finger on the job
Pistol on my side, leave a nigga on his side
Mr. Always High, but nigga, you can call me ""Slime""

Drippin' Avianne, Fiji, I'm a water slide
Pockets fatter than a greedy nigga on a diet
Nina on my side, but she say you can call her ""Nine""
Divas on my side, so many they could form a line
Strippers on my side and I got 'em performin' live
Hot girl in the bed and she prefer the warmer side
Pistol on my side, I'm talkin' 'bout the Army kind
Cita, that's my moms, only had her and father time
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear it harmonize
Numbers don't lie, the Number One Stun- never mind
Tunechi in this bitch, eyes lookin' like Konnichiwa
Swizzy on the beat, I'ma beat it like policia
Burr, burr, burr, man the Uzi needs speech lessons
Pistol in my briefs, you don't wanna get this brief message

Oh, oh, y'all think it's a game (yeah)

Pistol on my side, you don't want that thing to scream at ya
Laughin' when you die, boy, my pistol a comedian (brr)
Pistol on my side, now he lyin' like the media
Clips longer than encyclopedias, you're readin' 'em
Double barrel, long barrel, short barrel, medium (brr)
We ain't hittin' licks, we beatin' 'em and then repeatin' 'em
Sugar in the coffee, sugar in the Morphine
Sugar sweet codeine, it ain't purple, then I'm barfing

Let the thing talk like it's sittin' on Maury (burr)

Please, no more zip locks or shoe boxes

All of the teachers in the school got fixed

I ain't riffing or raffing or rapping or yapping
No I ain't from the Nolia, but I'm clapping
No I ain't into coke, but I have it
No I ain't into dope, but I stock it
Like I ain't got the po in my pocket
No I don't like they clothes but I cop it
The white man looking like I ain't fit to go in my pocket
No I ain't fit to stop I'm still poppin
Holla, like I ain't at your throat
I'm a turtle neck collar
Our purpose is respect with a capital R
Whoever don't die today, they'll be back tomorrow nigga

 Well holla at me nigga, talk to me, let me know something
Cause right now I'm tired of hustling
And these rocks ain't doing nothing
And to tell you the truth I feel like I be out here for the fun of it
I swear if I don't hit a lick by next month, I'm done with it
 Understand, but you ain't listening you just talking

 A Z-28, boy go head, once I get change

 Well look I ain't fucking with you
You too young from the start
 Man that ain't even got anything to do with it
Its dedication and heart
 Dedication and smarts
Don't put your heart in this game
Cause when you fall to deep in love you get caught in this game
 Well correct me when I'm wrong
And acknowlegde me when I'm right
 Lil' bitch, if your hard head ass listen I might
 B, I'm all ears
 Get your ass in this car
 Unlock the door

 Don't holla at me

I’m Gangsta,The Carter Files,UnKnown,"Hey, take a real good look at the boy
And tell me if you see just as much gangster as I feel, Y'know?
Cause that there is all I can be man
That there is just me man
W-E-E-Z-Y
WE! Hey!

Wayne deep in the grova, out comes the small soldier
Alcohol and douja, bother my composure
Oh lord, am I supposed to be this way?
Do I live no good? This may be wrong but it feel so good
Far from home, I still feel so hood
I got the set on my belly
That shit gon' be there till a nigga get buried
I ain't scary, bring it, I'm ready
I be on them Antera's to the cranberry
Handle the whip like Andretti
And I handle a bitch like my man Nelly
My nick(?) gotta go down down baby... till I uh oh, y'know!
I move a rainbow lambo on mo-mo's
As far as dough go, I'm up like no-do's
Bet I never sweats no ho
I don't get no type of threats from no foe's
I don't threat the po-po's cause I don't respect the po-po's
Many say that I possess a dope flow, and I accept
Cause when I'm being Weezy I'm at my best

And even if I wanted to I can't change... I'm gangsta!
""Just as sure as my name is D'wayne"" (Tony! Toni! Toné! sample)
I say I'm gangsta.. y'know

I ball hard like a small guard
The small boy sliding out a large toy
Me fall off? Naw boy, I'm a stand through it
The flow deserving ovation so clap your hands to it
The flow is real so A-man to it, jam to it
..been a minute since Block is Hot, this is man music
..had opinions for Block is Hot but this is grand music
..hand, blew it because the bands who damn igloo it
..and I ram the damn dick to your people's people/
Get mo' booty than Benzino's single, from bi-sexual to bi-lingual
After I sex you up it's ""bye skeezer""
And I see you later baby, I'm a player
The chrome wide, fee on the five g/
I sit deep wit my heat 'case shit gets steep
Weezy a dirty south boy, I eat pig feet
I'm just me.. foreal, I'm just me

And even if I wanted to I can't change... I'm gangsta!
""Just as sure as my name is D'wayne"" (Tony! Toni! Toné! sample)
I say I'm gangsta.. y'know

And nah I'll pro'lly never kill nobody, but I've pointed my pistol
And those of you who I pointed it at, I'll still kill ya
I'm still familiar wit the hustle
I could go dope, weed or coke, bet I'll never see broke
And I know to never say never but whatever, I never felt better than now
I'm 19, I'm a veteran now
When I.. step out my house I need weaponry now
Fuck around and I bet it be bloaw, YEAH!
And they.. wondering how I get so rich as a child
Remember, I was before Romeo and Bow Wow/
Shit, I had O's way befo' Romeo or Bow Wow
But no disrespect my daughter crazy bout 'em
And.. notice how you notice nothing's fake about me
There's something great about me
And I'm still young so there's plenty more to break about me
And people brace yourselves, place yourselves in these 7 and a halves
You don't know the half, and tell me who can walk my path
Not a soul
Your boy live his life on the edge.. Geronimo

(click clock) What you got? Glock. (Look)

Nigga I'ma tell ya straight off the bat
I got a mac in this bag with 20 grams of crack
And I'ma sit in the back seat of yo' 'Lac
Just in case I gotta snap, a firette to the chest
If I don't know shit, I know cars and broads
I done ordered plenty hits and watched heads come off
And I done saw my nigga get life behind them bars
To them dog hoes, nigga, we scream ""fuck 'em all!""
I hustle hard in these city streets
I got my block on fire with my HB's
Spinnin' Benz in these drop tops double r
Cook a brick, flip 'em up, now I got 'em hard
And you can find me
Right up in them hallways, holdin' and totin'
Got the whole motherfuckin block loaded and smokin'
Nigga know one thang: its some uptown shit
If a nigga get it fucked, then we killin' a bitch

Nigga I'ma tell ya this, straight off the bat
I got a mac in this bag, with 20 grams of crack
Well let's go nigga, see we can slide nigga
'Cause if you hot, then I'm hot, let's ride nigga
Look, I'ma tell you this, straight off the top

Let's go nigga, let's slide nigga
If you hot, then I'm hot, let's ride nigga

Better pay attention now so you don't forget later
I run the damn block, I oversee all of the paper
Don't make me take ya, play ya
I cock the Glock and spray ya
Call it a caper, won't be no as-salamu alaykum
And J, he got the gauges, they cocked and ready
Make me run up in ya places and pop ya daddy
Got them bricks rocked and heavy, let it be known
I cook it hard and cut 'em in zones and the money be gone
Then I hit a blunt to the dome, and ride when night falls
Supply the white raw, if there's a problem, knock ya wife off
Lock the spot down
Respect it young nigga, I'm creepin' over
Now cut it with just a little bakin' soda, breakin' boulders
I take it out my holster and bakin' soldiers whenever
Nigga it's whatever, tell ya ma to call the reverend
You see me on the block with crack, gats, and weed
Rats, plats, and ki's, that's practically me

Let's go nigga, let's slide nigga
If you hot, then I'm hot, let's ride nigga

See I'm a hustler, cut-throat, put rhymes in mom's muffler
You can't even count how many times the 9's bust at ya
Some of the, niggas that you run with are, suckas bruh
None of ya, won't leave, without some bullets up in ya
Niggas can't hold me down, wodie wild
'Cause all that they can hear is loud screamin' and explosive sounds
They show me how to cook that brown and rock that white
No school, put that book back down, pick up that knife
See that's the real reason I hate to be on tour
I'd rather be back on the block with a bird of that pure
Niggas got it all wrong, thinkin' I'm all song
But yall gon' twist it and end up all gone
Dog-gone cocksuckers, you not thuggers
I pop dozens of Glocks, cousins, in my struggle
So stop frontin', it ain't gon' get ya everywhere
I'ma start bustin', and bullets hit ya everywhere

Nigga I'ma tell ya this, straight off the bat
I got a mac in this bag, with 20 grams of crack
Well let's go nigga, see we can slide nigga

Bum bum, these niggas they so whomp whomp
Watchin' me and all they missin' is some pom poms

Cellulite all on that ass, I call it lump sumps
But baby girl, tell me why you actin' funny
Every time I come around, you gotta ask me for money
See really, trickin' off ain't my thing
But I might give you somethin' if you change the game
Now, the only money I probably spend
Is on holidays, like Holiday Inn
And girl I can see it all over your face
That make up ain't making up for the mistakes
You know one thing, you ain't gettin' no money
You stump with your friends and all of them wan' fuck me

You hoes should be paying me now
But I'm priceless

Why you actin' bad with all of that ass?
Why you actin' bad with all of that ass?

Wait, baby hold up, baby wait a minute
Don't confuse me with these niggas, I done got offended
Don't confuse me with these niggas, I done got offended

Let 'em know how you've been thuggin

All I was taught was murder murder
Kill drama, and nothin' less
I strap tha Smith-Wess, and bust.. it in they chest
I had ta hustle hustle hustle hustle
Grind and struggle for success
Hid grams in girls' breasts, stick bricks.. under they dress
Them niggas there with big Willy

Hope when I catch them slippin'
Him and they daddy's trippin'
Shorty can hold it down
Shorty be totin' rounds
Smellin' like a pound on school grounds
Shorty, wow
Hair... all over my head
Bandana 'round my braids
Eyes bloodshot red
Briches down to my legs, guns up in my trench
When niggas play, they get drenched
My pockets is full of lint
So, nigga, stay off the bend, I'm young with bad nerves
Since I lost my father, I've been troubled hurt and disturbed
So Ion even hesitate to leave 'em on tha curb
And wet them niggas shirt, nigga, get 'em for them birds

Ain't been home in two weeks

But all I got ta offer is drama, and many problems

Lemme tell 'em
You remember that there nigga use to be thuggin' it out (Out!)
Blunt in his mouth, would stayed masked up in the drought
Run in your house, ""Lay down! Nobody move! (Move!)
Tell that slut go get your stash, and empty your pockets, fool!""
That's how it was... crime, struggle, drivin' for scrubs
Lots of thugs... make niggas count the ants in the mud
Some niggas choose ta come back for me, ride around my set for me
Might start jackin' because I got that SKS with me
!Okay! (!okay!)
Listen, all you ballin' niggas betta !relocate! (!'locate!)
Cause, see, ya'll got it
I gotta make my cheese !rotate! (!rotate!)
And Right now I'm doin' bad
So just give me with whatever you have, my stomach hurt, I need a bag
I'm street-livin'... week for week
No-sleep livin'
Look outside ya window in tha mornin', your jeep missin'
My heat sizzlin'
I'm ready to sweep these niggas
Geezy... make 'em remember Weezy, nigga!

Remember he? Tha little G, never die
Took one to tha chest, but Weeze Wee never die
Remember he? Tha little G, never die
Have B.Geezy on his side, so Weezy Wee never die
Lil' Weezy Wee... had ta steal, hustle, and jack
Weezy Wee roll with K's, Glocks, and MAC's
Tha little G, he was raised keepin' it real
That's my lil' nigga, I taught him to get it how he live, nigga
Remember he? Tha little G, never die
Took one to tha chest, but Weeze Wee never die
Remember he? Tha little G, never die

Got a whole lot of money, and a bunch of ways to make it
I'mma country ass nigga got diamonds in my teeth ho
Chopper that I'm toting make me feel like Deebo
Rock a nigga boat then speed off on the speedboat
Take a nigga ho and skeet all in her speedo's
Take a nigga ho and show her how to break a kilo
Show the bitch how to turn a bird into a beetle

Just money, hard dick, no foreplay
Standing in the court way, fuck what the court say
There's money on the corner baby, welcome to my workplace
Sippin' with my drink laced, you know how I get down
I promise baby I'mma fall asleep if I sit down
Uptown his town, Hollygrove hizzound
Fuck with the little man, you will never get found
211 187, I'm on a mission
Mother fuck whoever higher, but I gotta get mine
This time I'm going for the big climb
And the boy about to incline, Jigga man I'm nearby
When it come to realize, the sooner they'll feel mine
But I ain't on that, I got money on my mizz-ind
Little ass niggas, stand tall like I'm 6'9""
Cash Money, Young Money, meet you at the finish line, bitch nigga

See all these new rappers got me missin' Biggie and Pac
And all these fake Jacobs made me get rid of my watch
And Hollygrove you can't get rid of my block
With all these big-heads, you'd think this was Benjamin's block homie
Cinnamon drop hop out spit at your pops
Behind mine, I'll do 10 in the box nigga
My neck of the woods is Uptown ask for me
Young Maine, Young Money, Cash Money, Fast Money
Had the fiends hittin' the wall thinkin' that they crash dummies
While you little petty hustlers struggling for gas money
I'm on a full tank, bitch I'm bout me
You'll probably catch me and Weezy Baby on South Beach
In back of the Phantom the TVs playing
The game about to start, some bitch singing the National Anthem (fuck)
Whether it's the streets or the CDs, y'all gon' R-E-S-P-E-C-T me

If you lookin' for me I be with your bitch nigga
Ho I done fucked and she done sucked my dick (yea)
If it ain't 'bout dollars (yea), then I can't holler (yea)
And everybody know the Birdman the king
And he love his son Wayne so he give me everything
And that's the logics nigga watch it
Keep my name up outta that nigga gossip
Money gon' drain like a brand new faucet
Aren't you conscious? alert for the coppers
They give us the work then throw us in jail
Don't smile for the cameras gotta know when to sail
I'm blowin' an L, low in the 12

You could be my rocker mommy
I could your chilly pepper
You could be my hot tamale
Have your ever made to a rockstar
In a hot car with the top off
In the middle of a parkin lot
You don't care who see, who look, or who watch ya
Pretty face
And the body soft as baby skin
She hopped on me and rode
I thought my name was Harley Davidson
You got your tattoos
I got my tattoos too
We stayin all night and do what rockstars do
We got the music
Bumpin thru the system
The room is real smoky
Highlights in a mansion
You loving all day
You sleeping all night
We up and hit the mall
Sweats cus you on bait
Try and imitate us
But could never duplicate us
Pull up in the Ferrari
Saying hello to all my haters
Have you ever mad love
To a rockstar
In a hot car
With his guitar, playing on the side
Have. you. ever. mad. love
You drive a fast car
I drive a fast car too
Suicide doors with the topless roof
Now were cursin
Glasses on the face
Cus he ducking paparazzi, they high speed chasin
We gotta mazaretti but we driven in a range
Cus we don't give a damn
Switch rides by the day, day, day
Now this is what I call rockstar love
This was the question I was thinkin of
Have you ever mad love
To a rockstar
In a hot car
With his guitar, playing on the side
Have. you. ever. mad. love
I'm a R.O.C.K star
And I can play
Like I play my guitar
Call me Weezy F. the best you ever saw
She the best you never saw
Cudnt even loook at me
Got a chauffeur
But he ain't even look me
In the back seat poppin like fried chicken cookin
And in tied to the
Like eyes on bugizzy

And no I won't play hooky
But no not never
Put my feet on the pedal
And make that guitar go medal like

Shit is a drug stuggle when you niggas upping prices
I hug the Glock like a turn buckle
Can't get stop by the vices, no license
Rolling like dices on the street
Where the eyeses hide
Where the crime is life
And the life is time, and the time is jail
And in the jail you stressin
The judge probley hit me with an algebraic expression
But I get away free like oceans elevan
And i'm motioned to meddle, like a pro-fe-ssional
And when i;m rolling expecially like a pimp suppose to
Watch how you sit down somethings in that sofa
If she with me, you know theres something in that ho bra
She's a foreigner so she say coca
I get broke off and they get brok-er
They like so what, i'm like so when?
We going know then how the turn in turn out
Cause we going shoot back till the burners burn out
Till the burning burn down every house the block hold
I'm hollering at you niggas with every shot the Glock hold
You can't see me there's a thousand blind folds
And my mind state just put a thousand on top of those
Chea, I do school and do lunch at popadoes
They want beef I'll turn to that to sloppy joes
Copy cats brrrrrrat, copy those
Had a strong relationshp with expensive cloths
This stuntin shit is expensive and intense
Like pulling up in something Americans can't invent
Chea, I make them fall back, they gotta indent
Like a paragraph, the first sentence, shit

Straight from the womb to pro, prolific

And I love all women (if you know what I mean)
Yes lord, I love them dark, I love them light
Short, tall, thick, thin and back one more again (alright)
But there's this one particular situation I need to tell you all about
I met a honey about a week ago
I got a little but I need some more
I ain't the only one to learn her curves
Matter of fact, forget what you heard
She's all, she's all that and more, oh yeah
Yes she is
Her reputation ain't squeaky clean
A little gossip ain't phasing me
So go ahead say what you want
You can give a damn, but I don't
Cause I'm gone, I'm already gone
Yes I am
Don't you know she's
She's my, redbone girl
A bitter sweet, but she's my world
Coffee cream, thick and lean
My redbone girl, redbone girl, yeah
Our baby hail from the Oakland Bay
Got an east coast vibe but a southern mind
A devil mind with an angel face
She'll leave and make a nonbeliever pray
For a chance, just to get some something
Yes she will
Uhh, you don't know what you do to me
But you're killing the girls in my history
I need a shot just to let her hit
She give me 2 when I need a fix
Lord knows I've tried, but I swear I can't quit
Don't you know she's my
She's my, redbone girl
Redbone but she's my world
Have you seen, my chocolate dream
My redbone girl, redbone girl
She's my, redbone girl
A bitter sweet, but she's my world
Coffee cream, thick and lean
My redbone girl, redbone girl, ooh
I like the long hair thick redbone
I do it so right, she say I'm dead wrong
And now she in love, like phase on
Now I'm in my zone, I got her head spinning, spinning like a cyclone
And it's them red women at my red eye zone
I'm high and my girl high yella
Fine as wine, put her in a wine cellar
Roses are red, do you mind if I smell them
What can you do, Consuela, Consuela
I like them light skin, lighter than a feather
And if she red hot, I'm biting that pepper
Tighter than my leather pants, let them say
She the same color as my flag – suwoo
She's my, redbone girl
Redbone, she's my world
Have you see, my milk chocolate dream

Handcuffs and whips I'm a sex slave
No wraps on ma back, rah, whatcha name?
I yell kunta rah kunta kinte
With one foot off I still try to escape but who can I run to like escape
I guess I got some attention to pay
The girl blazin like a doughnut on a early sunday
And I could be the chocolate on top of her sundae
She lookin at me like a fat bitch infront of entree


You see she wreckless eye baller feelin a nigga swagga
If looks was fuckin no telling how many kids we done had
Got me feelin like Missy, cause she all in my grill
And be face off the peel time to give her that whip a peel
Betcha I can get her home, 4 shots of patron
And then I know it's on tell my niggas look I'm gone
Ma you grown so don't worry bout your girls tryna criticize
One night with Mack & babygirl you'll be dick-notized
Fatten up your hips and thighs
Help that ass bout out
And on the next song tell her give ma dick a shout out
See she could be ma sockee
And I could be her plug
Or she could be ma fiend and I could be her drug
No disguise


All I do is ice grill em
Then he get hard again
He know my pussy stay warmer than a cardigan
Slippery, slimey, excuse me don't mind me
Say it's too fat for me to be this tiny
I'm such a maniac, lemme get some brainiac
You know that special head, like I'm in special ed
Got me givin you these nasty looks
Stick me up with the uh, that's the nasty jooks

That’s Not Love,UnKnown,UnKnown,"That’s not love
That’s not love
That’s not love

Snakes in the grass, so I stay in the pavement
Survived the battle with animals and cavemen
And dead animals and dead men
I’m all in and my only friend is Amen
Keep your mouth cosed, you wanna know why you die
The answer’s right under your nose
Exposed to the street, in the game I don’t cheat
I just play my position, get MVP
I get money, don’t shit come free
It’s my life and I run it even when
Keep my business in my pockets, don’t wash with bleach
And I never show my hand, not even to me
See…


Say what’s on your heart if you’re real
Cause the scars you can’t see be the hardest to heal
And I used to chase money, now I have it brought
Cause you can only chase something that you haven’t caught
If there’s a summertime in hell, it’s not as hot
You empty clip niggas ain't got a shot
These diamonds on my neck are an eyesore
Now you decide if their to die for
Advice to my haters, do what I say now
Report to the nearest roof and take the fast way down
Thought it was love, how foolish of us
I do me, she do her, sometimes we do eachother


Look, as the crooked World revolves
Love spelt backwards is evol (evolve)
And Evil spelt backwards is live or live
And when death comes you better have lives to give
I spit that real talk like knives to ribs
And rats die ugly, die with kids
These niggas is snitching and still living
I hope my words are like razors to the bitches
Niggas pretend like they actually in
But when it go down they fuck around and be them
That blood look familiar when it’s leaking
If you scared, go see a Deacon nigga
That ain't love


Life is but a dream
Ain't always what it seems
Meanwhile get your cake red velvet butter cream
Raise your glass and lets toast to when we didn't have
Hustle plus muscle equal success, I did the math!
I see these haters in passing, yeah they ’round
I be on the way up, they be on the way down
Now I can sit and talk shit like Skip Bayless
You looking for these shoes baby you can skip payless

Bunch of bad bitches in an Ipod playlist
Just anothger page in my success story
I make my worst enemies wish the best for me",https://genius.com/Lil-wayne-thats-not-love-lyrics

Grown Man (Lights Out),Lights Out,2000.0,"Dawg you gotta feel me on this one
What it be like dawg? I'm on some, some adult grown up type shit
Look who I be around nigga, look who I been around nigga
Jeezy, Juvie, Turk, B and Slim dawg pay attention dawg

Age is nothing but some digits, nigga trust me on this
Cause I think I speak for everyone when I say life is a bitch
I ride D L in the C L, gun right in my grip
I slip a clip in every whip cause haters likely to trip
Come home to my future wife and every night she'll flip
She end up catching rights to her lip behind diapers and shit
But I like me a spliff drink henny without the ice when I'm pissed
Go to the club and start a fight thinking I'm Tyson and shit
But I'm a man so I'm able to handle my situations correctly
And I know I might be young but nigga gone definitely respect me
But in the mean while I'm fighting gun charges in court
And in a couple of weeks our next tour about to start
Its like I'm never happy now
Except for the fact my daughter saying I love you daddy now
And that kinda juice me up, but I smoke bout 3 blunts
And puff a cooler boost me up
And say a prayer for everyday
Just so I get through the stuff, but I be like

Awww man, it's complicated doing everything on your own man
Being responsible for everyone in ya home man
And when you feel like everything is going wrong man
I'm gone stand cause I am a grown man
Awww man, it's complicated doing everything on your own man
Being responsible for everyone in ya home man
And when you feel like everything is going wrong man
I'm gone stand cause I am a grown man

I try to keep my head up, but I die to keep my bread up
And usually I'm fed up thinking everything's a set up
But I get up this stick out my chest and clutch on my nuts
And I get hit up with all kinda stress
And put up wit the stuff, just trust me it's tough
But I maintain to climb through it all
And I still manage to be Lil Wayne therefore I shine and I ball
And dawg I live for today and hope and pray there's a tomorrow
And I borrow confidence from out my heart when things get awful
And I'm often on the edge stuck without a solution
Someway I still pick it out and shuffle out the confusion
And I don't need nobody so keep yo advice and just doubt me
Cause y'all cats don't really know me, y'all just know about me
But my dawgs be on my side they keep me covered with spirit
And plus I know my fathers watching and my mothers the dearest
And I ain't never say I thought they ain't appreciate what I do
But just know if I wasn't a man we wouldn't make it through, but I be like

Awww man, it's complicated doing everything on your own man
Being responsible for everyone in ya home man
And when you feel like everything is going wrong man
I'm gone stand cause I am a grown man
Awww man, it's complicated doing everything on your own man
Being responsible for everyone in ya home man
And when you feel like everything is going wrong man
I'm gone stand cause I am a grown man

Who would have known that this was someday turn out so hectic?
But I chose my own life so I gradually accept it
And I'm influenced and effected by the way it became
And I don't play with it at all so I don't say its a game
And even though I grew up hard and I have gracefully changed
I'm always street so I'll forever be facing a change
And I'll keep the slang brutained on the waist of my pants
And I demand respect from all if not then I'm wasting a man
And if I want it, then I get, and if I need it, I have it
Take care of them family first, plus the liquor and weed is a habit
And ever so often I'm congratulated for the succeeding at last
But when they turn they back I just have Jesus leading my path
And I ain't ask for you to like me, I don't care if you hate me
But don't mistake me, no other man can never make me or break me
Now I be faithfully inspired by the hood til I'm gone
And I dawg I do believe I'm grown so I'll be good on my own, but I be like

Awww man, it's complicated doing everything on your own man
Being responsible for everyone in ya home man
And when you feel like everything is going wrong man
I'm gone stand cause I am a grown man
Awww man, it's complicated doing everything on your own man
Being responsible for everyone in ya home man
And when you feel like everything is going wrong man
I'm gone stand cause I am a grown man
Awww man, it's complicated doing everything on your own man
Being responsible for everyone in ya home man
And when you feel like everything is going wrong man
I'm gone stand cause I am a grown man
Awww man, it's complicated doing everything on your own man

I keep thinking of you, I keep, I keep thinking of you, I keep thinking of you
Girl, I keep thinking of you, I keep, I keep thinking of you, I keep thinking of you
I keep, I keep thinking of you, I keep, I keep thinking of you, I keep thinking of you
Girl, I keep thinking of you, I keep, I keep thinking of you, girl

And we ain't even gotta go far, we ain't gotta talk about the war, we can just (Get it (7x)
I said we ain't even gotta go far, we ain't gotta talk about the war, we can just (Get it (7x)

Damn I'm just thinking home 3 winner
Chirping late night, she had the light up antenna
Voices far from ?
13 speaking like we 23 sometimes I would even miss dinner
Cause talking with you felt more important than Jordan's release when the 17's, remember
I get em, similar to any girl I've mentioned
They only thought I'd mention I'm only playing with your intuition
Your senses sensed that I was different
But too flashy for boyfriend material
But I beg to differ
And this is it I'm showing you more material
Now listen, let's Kiss, like Gene Simmons
I've got a vision, fuck a title
We the perfect image, you and I
No eyein' them, them girls, you be eyein' them, cause they be eyein' him
They water stronger than vitamins
Loving you to death, I didn't expect
Beautiful girls, make you suicidal
I guess I'm dyin' then..

Up jump the boogie, and shorty said she feeling my flavor
And even when I ain't looking, I got her on my radar
And yes I know man I am so, so blessed to have her
So yesterday, today, and the day after; I keep thinking of you
I keep thinking of you


Shorty said she feeling my swag
Shorty said she feeling my style
I keep thinking about her
About you, about you
I keep, I keep, I keep thinking of you, I keep, I keep thinking of you, girl
I keep, I keep, thinking of you I keep, I keep thinking of you, girl
I keep thinking of you, I keep, I keep thinking of you
All the things I could do, I could do them to you
And I'm thinking of you, thinking of you

Damage is Done,The Suffix ,2005.0,"Runnin' from the scene, Hammer in my jeans
Dead bodies behind me, the cops'll never find me
Arm & Hammer Clean on my way to the honeycombe
Hustle all night tell my bitch I'm never coming home
Be there in the morning, stop cryin' bitch
The sun is home, drop it on the living room table
Bitch the money home, I know you ain't gon' stay once the money gone
So while I'm rich I pull my dick and get my fuckin' on
Youngin' on some real ""Gangsta Gangsta"" shit
Blame it on the neighborhood I was sanctioned in
But I'mma make sure we get them acres
Tell 'em fuck computers, we good with paper
Tell 'em fuck the world cause I'm hood by nature
Feelin' that way is how the hood'll make ya
The hood is vacant, the streets are empty, yeah
Mr. Bush, rebuild the city, but

Yeah, over like yesterday floatin' to the floodgates
This is New Orleans, welcome to the blood state
A blood bath, and you ain't nothin' but tub bait
No political justice not even the judge safe
If his ass can't swim he get a closed case
We need our own space, I ain't talkin' about Jupiter
No luck, no help and we the fuckin' future
I'm a hoosier, usually the cool one
But when I need it, I turn into a looter
God forgive, but do he forgive the brutal
Even when it's for the better of your junior
Soon you see that life's just another movie
And the main character dies at the end, usually
There's nothin' that haven't been done that you can do to me
I been hit, I been shot nigga shoot at me!

Yeah, money on the mind, murder in the plans
Disturbin' if you may, but it's dinner for the fam
Hustler by law, support when I can
Hustle when I can, tell me nothing I'm a man
Smell my shit as I walk off the stand
Nuts to my feet with my heart in my hand
Pardon my G, but I'm one of a kind
Been shot two times, here to put it in a rhyme
Slow lane, move the Coupe like a 5
If I get pulled over, bitch I'm gon' do time
And I know my niggas love me, but they can't do mine
So I gotta be smart, get bread or get behind
Get lost or get in line
But the carpet's still fine
So keep tryin', the whole world turnin' back
But we keep tryin' until we get our piece, no piece
Keep Firin'

What I do is, I don't go out to the clubs
And when you do see me in the club, trust me, I have been paid to be there for those thirty minutes that you enjoyed with me
I don't stay inside for nothin' couse my house is nice
I don't just get in my cars and just ride around neighborhoods where no girls are at, because my car is nice
I don't do that
What I do is, I go to studio
And I just stay in the studio
See you have to understand the difference
The difference between me and you is to you, this is your job
To me, this is my life
The club; that's my job
The mall; that's my job
Your neighborhood; that's my job
This studio; this is my life
This is what I do better than anything

Hello world, I'm the dope dealer
I love it when she talk crazy, that dick make her walk crazy
That last time was awesome, all the lines, we crossed them
I ain't a killer but don't push me, I OJ Simpsoned that pussy
That's the shit, pussy taste so good make you smack your lips
I don't know about you but I'm a beast with mine
She said she wait for the Carter to 69, I told her ""Sorry 4 The Wait""
I value her time like an Audemars Piguet
And we gonna stay current like the water in the lake

Pardon the slur, that's the purple, it feel so real like it's virtual
Any kind of position, she's versatile
And she take it every way except personal
Yeah, that's my bitch, pussy wetter than a wishing well
I wish I was in it right now instead of making this song
Hut one, hut two, I run it in the end zone
Don't trip when I say I can't see you
And she say she working on her career
Smoke got our eyes looking like we from Korea
We floating but I'ma rock the boat like Aaliyah, R.I.P

Shorty knows I fuck her with her hard body
Shorty fine by me, spend some time by me
It's a jungle out there, come and climb my tree

I said fine, shit, I was taught to live and let live
So live it up, baby, giddy up, baby
It's your world, ain't trying to interrupt but maybe
We moving too fast but fuck it, let's crash
One day we gonna have to leave our love in the past

Slide in you, safe

Duckin rat packs like Sinatra and Sammy

Stop through my honey chrome right along the beach side
Ay, how can I answer at your sweet mind
Tell me 'bout your day

Hah, okay, I'm waitin' on my fourth time
And later on the 5th, so I don't forget
I got my lady in the whip, she got my name on her hip
And she don't let another name out her lip, uh huh, gangsta
See, if I don't play 'round and she gon' stay down
So last summer, I retire my number, ho
So no, I can't jot you my number though
My nigga real think you hot as a mother, but

Baby girl, I know that we can make it through the weather
As long as we strong, everything will stay together
When times get hard, long as we call upon the Lord
Everything will be fine, everything will be fine

I will ne-e-ever leave you girl

Full time mother, you work hard everyday
I wake up beside you, thank the Lord everyday
Oh, beautiful woman, I look forward everyday
Just to see that childhood scar on your face, hah

If your girl get out of line, she a manner chick?
If my world get out of line, she program my shit
I know my shit do stink, but she can stand my shit
I got the flip-flop paint on her standard shift
Dot 6 Range Rover, I advance my bitch
How you gon' go get some pants like that
With an ass like that, you know I'm bad for that
But you ain't gotta answer that
Long as every time I call you answer back
I said


Ride with a G and come join me on this adventure
Hop on the beat and put your ass on the 20 inches
I'll slide you the key, you wait for me after the concert
I promise I'll leave straight from the stage to under you skirt
Got riders with me, but don't mind them, they only homies

I bag the caine quicker, and sprinkle like rain, nigga
Flood the av quick with the quarters and halves, nigga

Give me the yay, or else I'mma put her in her sneakers
Wow (wow, wow) you can catch me in all black with no smile
Me, Turk, Geezy, and 'Nile - chicka-POW!
How come these niggas keep burnin the world?
And why the hell this nigga Wheezy keep firmin your girl?
Turnin the wheel on the orange and teal Bentley drop
Then I'mma put that up and hop in the van and hit your block
Tell your mom to get the cops cause y'all gon' need 'em
When you see them bullets that my Glock pop, y'all gon' eat 'em
See this for all my niggas in the pen, I hope for freedom
And this for all my niggas buyin bricks, I got 'em cheaper

Nasty case, nigga run up in your crib, crash the place
Mask the face, automatic attach to waist
You bastards play? Then it get awful and bad
There will be no more walkin for dad, and it's off with your head
And they gon' either get it right, or they get it at night
And when they spit, it lick his ass twice like 20 damn dice
Henny and ice is what I prefer, but light on the rocks
I pack them clips tight on them Glocks and light up your block
And if there's coke involved, then your throat's involved
I get the toaster and roll up and smoke most of y'all
Me and my nigga, Super Sosa, run up in your crib
While your grandma watchin Oprah, jag her up and rope her
If you wan' grudge, chances slim like Ethiopia
If you want drugs, I got more flavors than Fruitopia
Recognize it's real and nothing other than that
Cause one from the mac'll have blood coverin your back, ha?

Who wan' beef with 'em?

Unreleased Freestyle #1,UnKnown,UnKnown,"I'm a feen for the green yea I'm addicted to money
I gotta feed my addiction that fat bitch is hungry
Since a youngin I've realized it's all about the benjamins
I like Abraham Lincoln and Thomas Jefferson
But every day I'm constantly disrespecting them
Cause I stay wipeing my ass with dead presidents
I am a veteran spitting better than all of these rookies
They think they harder than woodies but they softer than pussy
I'm like a big red button u really don't wanna push me
I stay with the burner I'm always ready to cook beef
I always got them good treez I stay blazing
On the mic my style is bananas like the AK clip
In real life I'm a sick fuck like aids is
With all these banana clips u betta hope I don't go ape shit
I'll give u a face lift for free
I'll leave u witta dry mouth if u tryta spit with me
Victory is wut I am used to
So I'm a just do me u do u
I'm koo koo u think u gotta couple of screws loose
Don't worry I'll tighting that up with my tool dude
I push fat bricks but if u a bad bitch I'll pull u
Don't waste your time tryna battle me cause you'll lose
I'm not playin this ain't a fuckin game to me
I just aim and squeeze and brains'll leak
Veins'll bleed and just stain the streets
No rat but I'm always chasing cheese
My flows nuts so squirrls always rush the booth
I'm into that beastiality yea fuck the bull
If it ain't bout makin money I don't budge or move

Boom Bap,The W. Carter Collection,UnKnown,"Take 'em to church

Momma don't cry
I know papa gone away
Grandpa gone and grandma ain't coming home today
But
Don't worry cause your son’s still the one
Though I'm under the gun I'm aiming for the sun
Dwayne Micheal Jr, born that
But I changed my name to Wayne
And nigga I ain't goin back
I'm kinda little but I figured I’d be bigger if I sold crack
So I sold that
OG’s from the block told me ""Youngin hold that""
So I held dat
Got on front street and then I fell back
Became well at cookin it til it smell flat
Vaseline it up
 and ship it out in gel packs
I failed at what the teacher used to yell about
Junior High was prison
High school was the bail out
But my momma knew her baby boy was fresher
Than a baby bottom in new Pampers on campus

This that boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
Fresh just hit me with that (He hit me in my face)
That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
But can you bless me with that (Bless me in my chest)
That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
Aye, Fresh, just hit me with that
That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap

That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
Fresh just hit me with that (He hit me in my face)

But can you bless me with that (Bless me in my chest)
That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
(Cause I'ma kill 'em with the flow, I'ma kill 'em with the flow)

My Mama Mia ain't raise no Fredo
And Rabbit showed me how to make more out of quelo
You gotta make that thing flow like a ?
And keep getting money like I'm on the payroll
And if anybody slowing the payroll
I gotta turn his fitted cap to a halo
So get adapt to the case loads of crack
The yayo, the smack
The face blows, the gats
Photogenic, 
we expose a rat
And turn that ho into tomatoes or plants
And yeah I smoke back to back to back
Like I’m on two tracks but you ain't feeling that
I'm ducking the county boys with they billy bats
I got my dogs with me lookin out for silly cats
Ball with me
Weezy where the city at
And If I fall stay up
Cuz I’ma get it back

This that boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
Fresh just hit me with that (He hit me in my face)
That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
But can you bless me with that (Bless me in my chest)

That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
(Cause I'ma kill 'em with the flow, I'ma kill 'em with the flow)

People always tell me I'm heavy I say believe that
But I don't get all full off the feedback
I'm where the G's at
We like “where the G’s at?”
Kick door, hands high or get your knees blacked
If I don't take everything I'ma be back
And I'm stickin to my word like bees wax
He acts an asshole for these stacks
C Notes not B Flats, ya understand me
Few leaves left the sole tree standing
Just as quick as the wind blew they went too
I’m in too deep, my roots go deeper than the spot
Where their bodies shouldn’t sleep
I probably shouldn’t speak like that
But it be like that
Never let a nigga with a knife see my back
I’m outta here
Let me see my hat
And I rock it so low I can’t see where I’m at

This that boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
Fresh just hit me with that (He hit me in my face)

Straight murder that boy and every pussy that's with em
Sit him in the trunk, tell him, ""Let's have fun""
No noise fat potato on the end of the gun
My boy’s get that paper just as quick as it come
And if you're standing in the way then mama missing her son
I remember back in the day it was me and Brandon
Cut school, smoke weed, I was strapped, he had one too
Rest in peace from the Hollygrove crew
Tell ya momma I will do whatever she need me to do

Lil Beezy we use to get red-eye
Can't believe my nigga dead ah

I'm an apple street killer, a eagle street soldier
Lil Spitter i'm a ropa, silver duck tape her
I'm a kidnapper, if ya bitch look good bet I'm a get at her
She see me in the coupe I put the petal to the metal
If ya boy wanna trip I put the ratta to the tatta
Everybody scatter tryna get the fuck away
Sparks fly, glass shatter, situation gets sadder
Daddy I'm a pitcher, who's the next batter
I whip it like gadda and I throw it right at em
Junior high school, high school when I had em
Had 10 dollar bags 25 dollar package
We ain't even in the same lane, stop lacking
Damn even Mack Maine tell me i'm macking
Nigga stop trippin, bitch shake ya laffy taffy
This is New Orleans classic, young Wayne the main attraction

I got that goose in my system
Somebody gone be my victim

Talkin with ya bitch, meeting with ya bitch, creeping with ya bitch Now I'm sleepin with ya bitch, you can keep her, she a bitch
I don't love her, I don't trust her
Nigga own mother told me the bitch loves to hustle
Gotta get that paper baby, gotta get that cake
Cop a black Lamborghini, put gold on the plates
Home to the beach, sand at my feet
R1 one wheel hanging off the seat
My nigga Lil Naughty was a downtown G
We use to blow 2 or 3, tell me all about the streets
My nigga Soulja Slim had a motherfuckin message
Magnolia head busta, Uptown legend

Lil Naughty we use to get red eye
I can't believe my nigga dead ah
Lil Soulja he meant what he said, ah
I can't believe that nigga dead, ah

My nigga Lil Spitta that's my nigga all day
First bullet out the barrel nigga better guard your face
Say my nigga Lil Spitta he in the game let's play
He about to take over for my half time break

Now once upon a time not long ago
He was in the hospital and damn near broke
And all he had was a mask and a Glock
A box of baking soda and a couple of pots
The streets was empty, the fiends was hungry
He wanted to give em just what they wanted
To get cheap coke all he needed was connect
So he called his homie Wayne from the Hollygrove set

Yes, then I got his call, I'll be on the way
Don't worry about nothing but that money to be made
Met up with Spitter we got the shit straight
And I gave him the dope and I kept the yay
Now we on the grind and the bitches know who we are
I come through in the car like gosh
My posture as delicate as fur, I'm all hers
Cut niggas head like barbers, fruity ass niggas is Starburst
Throw em in the ceiling fans

And it shoot a bunch, you just lunchin' and Monch like Pharoahe
Bloodshot eye's on the sparrow
And I stay high, but on-point like an arrow

Jumping like a bungee no rope
Even in the dungeon I glow
Even if it ain't sunny I glow
If it ain't about money I go
Nowhere I'm nailed to the floor
Money controls where I go
It is the sail to my boat
And it's going down it's going down
Like there's a whale in the boat
See you can smell that I smoke
And yep I sip that lean
You hit me with that combination that make my eyes bleed
I'm a shark in the water yep I swim with the big
So I don't have time to deal with Willy the squid
L-lilly pad niggas l-look at the monster
Y-you don't want to crash like la la labambas
I got them 24 inches, sittin on them Joe Buddens
And the trunk straight jumping, bitch I can't hear nothin'
Though I might do the Spurs, sittin' on them Tim Duncan's
And in that lamborghini, I do donuts like dunkin
How come every bad bitch with a pussy, wanna fuck 'em
But I just feed 'em drugs, and watch 'em fuck each other
My neck was 100, and my wrist was another
It make her pussy wet, I leave that bitch with a puddle
I'm a beast, I'm a dog, I should rap with a muzzle

Holding my coast by myself never folding
Throwing the SQAD 7 up lettin' em know it
Wizzle F toting floating
Notice the stroke in my motion, strollin'
Toke and a poke and a smoke got me loaded
Put a purple ocean in my soda make potion
Pull a rover over by some hoes make noise
Roll ya body like a snake slow for all my boya'z
Wizzle hotter than ya hottest gat but so poised
Bodies flying in the air while I whip the Harley
I'm hardly seeing you playa you can't see me
I'm a gangsta I supposed to be on TV, really
And the rolls gold bezzle show clearly
Fee where you at you gotta feel me Daddy


See I look to my side and Lil Gudda say peel ya

Nothin' but flavors man
Nothin' but wages man
Nothin' but paper
I'ma fuck it and take it and show all of my homies
Drop 20's on the 'Rari
Scratch off at parties
I'ma make your hoe grab all her shorties up in the Escalade Suburban
Snatch off that lingerie
I'ma make y'all boys back off the army
Put that hammer to your dome
Now come off that arm piece
And I like that chain
I'm feeling that heck
My papi's Ozzy Ozbourne
And I'm feeling like Jack
Gimme dat!

That's wassup
Man, it's weezy F man

I Don’t Like It (Light),UnKnown,UnKnown,"[Intro: Lil Wayne & 
 Imogen Heap
]
I don't even know what that bitch saying
But I don't know what most of these bitches be saying anyway
Most of these bitches don't know what the fuck they be saying
It's not even light out
Yeah, let's go
[Verse 1: Lil Wayne & 
Imogen Heap
]
Uh, I break the leg off a bitch
And kick her in the ass with her own shit
I'm getting tired of my own dick
'Cause it keep me up all fucking day and fucking night
It's just fucking all fucking day and fucking night
I can't believe this butter butt fuck a butter knife
My dick get hard when thunder strikes
I need help, I need a light
I know they gonna cross me if they crossed Jesus Christ
I cross my heart, hope to die
Met a bitch that was rich who never seen roaches fly
I took her to the South side, left her ass outside
Legs open mouth wide
I get high like them niggas on that movie How High
Or maybe higher  die or live in fear
I hope new rappers disappear
But I ain't worried 'cause they will in a year, haha
It's not even light out
You appear to be a queer
I leave you in a swamp crying crocodile tears, haha
As the crowd cheers, thank you
I thank God every day because I ain't you, haha
[Bridge: Lil Wayne & 
Imogen Heap
]
But you've somewhere to be
I'ma let that bitch sing
No hesitation
No, I've never seen you like this
And I don't like it
I don't like it
But she's always talking to me Lord
I don't like it
I don't like it
I don't like it at all
Shit, you still ain't finished?
I don't like it
[Verse 2: Lil Wayne & 
Imogen Heap
]
Alright, kiss me on my bullet wound
Before I jump the broom, I'd rather jump over the fucking moon
Your girl just told my girl she wanna lick what's in my underoos
And every time I tell her ""Leave,"" she hate to go like summer school
I spit, I vomit, I pukes, I shits, I number twos
I makes money, makes moves and make fun of you
I jump off her clit and I land on her face
I squeeze on her tits 'til her implants deflate
Bet I jump off some shit and I land on my skate... board
If life is a bitch, mine is Betty... Ford
They try to make me go to rehab
Rest in peace Amy Winehouse
I hope I sign your autograph before I sign out
Merlot color flag with my 9 out
It's not even light out
I cock and shoot, look like I'm calling time-out
But I'm not
[Bridge: Lil Wayne & 
Imogen Heap
]
But you've somewhere to be
I just shoot her
No hesitation
Pow
No, I've never seen you like this
Pow
And I don't like it
I don't like it
I don't like it
She don't like it
I don't like it at all
She know she like it
[Verse 3: Lil Wayne & 
Imogen Heap
]
Shanell just walked in
They find your hand sticking out the water like a shark fin
When I was young, I used to cry because I had dark skin
Martin Luther King gon' slap the shit out me when I die, man
I can make any bitch shit in my hand
And mush it in your face like a pie pan
I used to fuck your girl, but that pussy feel like dry land
Smoking on that good make me look like I'm from Thailand
Fuck y'all niggas, not literally
My girl from Italy
But fuck that shit, I'll make your bitch swallow my little me's
I make the healthiest motherfucker sick of me
And hoes wanna have my baby like Billie Jean
But beat it
Get it? Jerk it off, beat it
It's not even light out
Yeah, and dry pussy tastes better when it's bleeding
Now tweet it
I can't believe I said ""Tweet"" in a rap
But you've somewhere to be
I thought I'd never say that
Fuck, I hate this song
No hesitation
No, I've never seen you like this

Yeah! What they talkin' bout Fee? they ain't saying shit
Nigga, we could hold court like Stan Smith
Or Judge Judy, you niggas better shoot me
Cuz I bought my mans a Glock, and I bought myself an oozi (brrr...)
Don't confuse me
No, they don't amuse me
I come after the money, like wednesday come after tuesday
I told stunna I'm wildin', he say 'don't worry I gotcha'
He told me 'cut they heads off, and bring them back to papa
Yeah! Them niggas getting scurred! Wurrd?
All that talk was just a whole bunch of verb
Pussy ass nigga got a whole bunch a nerve
I have em puttin' your picture on a bunch of shirts
Cuz I smoke a lot of weed, and drink a whole bunch of syrup
I like brain, so I fucks with a whole bunch of nerds
(Hehe) 
I am number one, cuz two is not a winner and no one remembers third


Money is the topic baby
See I'm a giant, all these other niggas mocking baby
They microscopic baby
Big crib, I can't even hear em knocking baby
Headed to the top, like I'm tied to a rocket baby
To all the foreign women, lets make a tropic baby
I got so many bitches, I could make a compilation
I'd like to thank the haters, for your cooperation
I got that doctor chopper, if you want operation
Niggas this is my crusaders, kill for confirmation
We all got on masks, we bout to toxic waste em'
I hope they mama's raised em', (why?) cuz they got bitch ways
If they don't pay for you, they get you back dead
Real talk, stop walking on your back leg
Step into the lime light, bullshit backstage
I used to tote a 32 up in my crack days
I tote that AK47 in my rap days

Yeah! Come and get it (tell em), anyone can get it
But since I'm the president, I be a little more politic ha
I chillin' in the clinic
And guess how many nurses I got working on my dizick
Snakes in the grass, rats, and lizards
But round here snitches don't exist like wizards
Ho this ain't punch, I'm sippin' on some syzurp
I roll a fat joint and do my fingers like scissors
The game so cold, I done had my share of blizzards
And now I got that big money running like rivers
Nigga, I'm here to get my shit straight
Burner on the hip waist
Leave a nigga street full of bones like a fish plate (aow! )
Yeah I'm from the hood, but now I'm living in a rich way
That's why I got on my knees and thank God for this day

G-series out in the streets right now
Hit a nigga on MySpace or somethin' man
Holla
(Sample)
Day dreamin'
I fell asleep beneath the flowers
For a couple of hours
On a beautiful day
Day dreamin'!

You already know
What the fuck is poppin'
Baby I'm what's hoppin-a
I keep a Zip-Lock bag full of 'Dro
And I keep a bad bitch wit' me on the low
I'mma be a G until the day that I go
I can feel it in the air
The reaper's comin' slow

Shhh...
I can hear the reaper comin'
But I ain't scared, oh, no, no, I ain't runnin'
Now when I walk past, you might see an extra shadow
Angels on my shoulders are usin' me for a battle
Spiritual warfare, good versus evil
I even fought the demons as a semen
Yes I was brought there, cursed ever since my day of birth
Got a Heaven-sent flow, though it's Hell on Earth
So, with that in mind, I don't live for Prada
I'm trying to stack and mack, and got stigmata
Tryin'a get the same fan base as Big Poppa
Sometimes, when I flow, they say the southern Big's popped up
They tell me ""don't get murked, or get locked up""
But I'm from Holly Grove, I can't give the block up (Holly Grove)
So til' the day they drop my box, fuck
I'ma ride with my Glocks up
You already know

(Bring it home mang)
I'm hitch hikin' on the highway of life
You might see me on the side of the road
(Who knew this nigga could sing?)
I asked the Lord to be my coat and umbrella
'Cause outside it's rainin' cold
It's so cold
It's so cold
It's so cold (America)
It's so cold

I say, Miss America, Land of the Free
You ain't never do nothing for a brotha like me
You sold me a dream of 40 acres and a mule
Then you turn that half-a-acre that I had into a pool
You get up on the news, lying about how the levy's broke
Now Weezy lost 2 Jags, and spitta's Chevy broke
Flooded out engines, messed up suspensions
You took everything we had, Uncle Sam, you Satan fan",https://genius.com/Lil-wayne-day-dreamin-lyrics

And no chargin' that wodie

See that red dot comin for

Cause I wants mine
I needs mine
And I'm about to get mine
But these dying
Look lil' daddy
You ain't got to worry about none of these other niggas
You needs to be worried about when Juvi comin to get ya
Look, I make a phone call to the big dog
Y'all bitches better handle y'all business before I hit y'all
Even though a nigga rich and I rock ice
I still bust a nigga head on the block aight?

It's enemy turf that I'm on
So I'ma play it how it go
Cock the hollow points

Cock the hollow points
And tote my black calico
My lil' brother Weezy

My big brother Juvi
Both hit tha blocks
Strapped up with the Uzis

What, What, La
Gun for gun
Eye for eye
Better move yo' wife and son
Cause I ride or die
Cash Money Hot Boy, bless me when I'm gone
But until then, load up the chrome, cause it's on
I been bout it
Put a boot up in my lip and put my thirty up in a clip
I drop the top and then I dip I hit his block and make 'em flip
And I be full of that trash
I be the first one to jump out the jag bust at 'em fast
Watch the bullets chop off the head
And make 'em fall in the grass
One move they all die
Lil Weezy a small fry, but gorilla when it's war time
Y'all better learn
When this nigga shoot it'll be all hell
Well then let 'em burn
Hold 'em fo' ransom, hear me smart boy
Seven churn and I be damn if I let 'em go
If I don't get my dough
Then hell will be all blowin'

And how to strap up
When it's time shoot it
Cock yo' heaters
Tie up yo' bags
It's time to do it
Blaze the blunt
Shut off the lights
And cut down the music
Roll down the windows
Turn the corner
And let loose with the bbbbrrrrrr
If ya don't know now
Then ya never will learn
You can play with Lil' Wayne
And yo' block get burned
You must love to go swimmin
Cause tha water gets deeper
See I bust you wide open
And take 'ya daughter with me
Here come the beat boy
Shoot out the street lights
Time to bring on the heat boy
If you ain't really wit it
Then you better get back
I open yo' chest
And make it look just like a wet cat
This is a death trap
I'mma a guerilla and I mean it
Leave ya' head still in a beanin'
Lyin' on the cement
Calicoe steamin'
Red dot beamin', dressed up suspicious
Play with Lil Weezy, you'll be dinner for the fishes

Watch how you dap me off, the strap might go off, POW
And I can take it back for y'all
Like the old '77 Cadillac with walls
I be peepin' in the back, Maybach for y'all
Weezy dope like crack dissolve
Ain't no cases round here gettin' cracked or solved
Cause ain't no boys around here 'bout to crack at all
Baby girl, what's really good? I'm trynna crack that off
Leave your man where he at, and ain't a Mac get off
Man, I got the dreads in the rubberband swingin' in the air
Got this thing in my other hand, ain't bangin' in the air, naw
And I ain't singin' this for help
I mean what I say, and say what I felt
I lean cause the K heavy weight on my left
Yao Ming couldn't block these shots himself

Stay deep 'Cedes Jeep big feet
Gator seats polar bear floors
I faithfully hold to pimp whores
You ate with me and you gon get yours
This eight with me that's bullets through doors
Got haze in me now I'm so tall
Come blaze with me cuz Beaky got more
And now or later I'm major player
I ball right I need an agent player
Ay ma you tight you need to page a player
That's so tonight you can taste a player
I got the burner on the waist if you flinching
My shit turning on 28-inches
My shit burning like 500 plus
And this album's a three permer and a clutch

24/7 (Yes, sir)
I go hard (Go hard, go hard, go hard)
Not here

I claim squad game till no more Wayne remain
Bang my thing till no more lane remain
Use the left lane man cook up the cocaine
Dudes a lil game and get her to do brain
That boy Weezy is a bad mother-feezy
Me and Young Jazze at the back of one tweezy
I'm so breezy off the Velvie and the perk
Now I'm getting head on the balcony on Bourbon
Apple and Eagle is the street that I shop
The Birdman my daddy and we fly south
And we don't go to work man we get work out
And the bricks may go as low as ten up in the drought
Niggas is selling and you should be buying
Niggas is telling and you should be dying
Niggas is yelling Cash Money till they kill me

You know if I'm doing it I'm probably doing it for the block
I'm out here bitch I got this here on lock
Come out here bitch I bet this here gon pop

Tap tha phones that you talk on
Jam ya up and take your arms off

With a crate of Crystile, couple of blunts, and a condom
Let him know if (let him know if) he down bad, that ain't my problem
Let him know if he come at me bad, then I'mma chop him
Ch-uh.. chop him
Put tha flame to him
All of a sudden tha thing hits straight through him

Thugged out, pants fall to my shoe strings

Lookin for my rocka girl
Baby I'll rock your boat
Rock your bed, and rock your world
But you gotta be as fly as me
You gotta know how to rock your stuff
VH1 Brett Michael, Be my rock of love
VS 1, big stones
Lemme rock ya
Maybe marriage, baby carriage
Lemme knock ya up
I could be your rocka daddy
You could be my rocka mommy
I could your chilly pepper
You could be my hot tamale
Have your ever made love to a rockstar?
In a hot car with the top off
In the middle of a parkin lot
You don't care who see, who look, or who watch ya
Pretty face
And the body soft as baby skin
She hopped on me and rode
I thought my name was Harley Davidson

You got your tattoos
I got my tattoos too
We stay up all night and do what rockstars do
We got the music
Bumpin thru the system
The room is real smoky
Highlights in a mansion
We lovin all night
We sleepin all day
Wake up and hit the mall
Stay fresh and rock our way
They try to imitate us
They could never duplicate us
Pull up in the Ferrari
Saying hello to all my haters

Have you ever made love
To a rockstar
In a hot car
With his guitar, playing on the side
Have. you. ever. made. love

You drive a fast car
I drive a fast car too
Suicide doors with the topless roof
Now we're cruisin
Glasses on the face
Cus he ducking paparazzi, they high speed chasin
We got a maserati but we drivin in a range
Cus we don't give a damn
Switch rides by the day, day, day
Now this is what I call rockstar love
This was the question I was thinkin of

Have you ever made love
To a rockstar
In a hot car
With his guitar, playing on the side
Have. you. ever. mad. love

I'm a r-o-c-k star
And I can play with that pussy like I play my guitar
Call me Weezy F the best you ever saw
She the best you never saw goo you ain't even lookin
Got a chauffeur but he ain't even lookin
We in the back seat poppin like fried chicken cookin
And I'm tied to that pussy like flies on my duce
Shawty got class
And no I won't play hooky
But no not never
Put my feet on the pedal
And make that guitar go madder like
Told ya girl
I could play with that pussy like I play my guitar",https://genius.com/Lil-wayne-rockstarr-lyrics

Before I sleep I pray to the Lord
My soul to keep and if I should die
Before I wake, I pray to the Lord
My soul to take for Goodness sake
Before I sleep I pray to the Lord
My soul to keep and if I should die
Before I wake, I pray to the Lord
My soul to take (Heavenly Father)

Yeah, I wrote my will just the other week
It was funny, it was only one sheet
And I know there's only one me
But I hope I am everything my son needs
I try and live right, stay on the drum beat
But I'm in the fast lane, in the front seat
I wonder, will I lose control of the Maserati
And hit some tree, just being young me?
Is there a heaven for G's and soldiers?
I can't go to hell, 'cause I'd take over
I feel it approachin' but I ain't scared
I made that bed and I should rest in peace

Before I sleep I pray to the Lord
My soul to keep and if I should die
Before I wake, I pray to the Lord

Before I wake, I pray to the Lord
My soul to take (Heavenly Father)

Yeah, and everytime I see the sun shine
I drop down and give thanks at least one time
Feeling like I'm living on the frontline
I'm feeling like every second is crunch time
I've had breakfast, will I make it to lunchtime?
And I ain't joking so don't be looking for punchlines
Will I be the next victim of a gun crime?
I don't know the answer, that's why I brung mine
Riding by myself late at night
Pistol on my lap at every single red light
Yeah, I made my bed right
So when I do I should sleep tight
In peace I rest (Heavenly Father)

Before I sleep I pray to the Lord
My soul to keep and if I should die
Before I wake, I pray to the Lord
My soul to take for Goodness sake
Before I sleep I pray to the Lord

Before I wake, I pray to the Lord

Bury me a gangster 'cause that's what I live
Don't cry for me I gave the best I could give
I can only do me, so that's what I did
And I cherish every breathe of my kid
And I don't wanna go before she grow, that ain't cool
But in this game of life I don't make the rules
Shit, so that's why I get twisted
So I can't feel it when it hits me
And my moms don't need that owner
But I see death around the corner
And if he, so I just gotta make my way around the block
You gotta answer the door when he knock
(Heavenly Father) Belee that

Before I sleep I pray to the Lord
My soul to keep and if I should die
Before I wake, I pray to the Lord

Bank so easy, niggas you know me
Bitches talk sideways get smacked the fuck up
I'm a pimp, but I don't move with a pimp cup
I'd rather keep my drinks in a thermos
Told yall before I was an advanced learner
Cops tryna send me off to camp like Ernest
Yeah, but I ain't going for that walk
Fuck around with me and I just let that gat talk
Yeah, I'mma let that heat spray
Right where you standing that's where you gone lay
Still play it cool, get off the streets
Cops came to the house, moms told them I was sleep
Cause she memorized the script to a tee
Told them that I had the flu and I was in the bed for weeks
Yeah, another victim of a murderer
Got your family running asking people have they heard of ya
All over, putting up posters
Like you got an album about to drop
But there ain't nothing bout to drop but that casket
Label me a bastard even though I know my pops, yeah
Rap game said I fell off the scene
Though I'm coming back like I forgot my keys, yeah

It's a shame how I gotta duck shots
From these hating ass niggas and these crooked ass cops
Fuck it, it just make me grind harder
Now I'm signed to young Carter
P89 be the answers to the my problem
Benchwarmers getting mad, I'm a starter
Number 1 draft pick, laughing in a black 6
Talk big shit and still turn bricks like back flips
Young Money be the circle that I ride fo'
Nigga we live to stay fly on you ass holes

But I got so much love for the south
Where the women be most thick and give great mouth
And love all the shit that a thug be 'bout
Now let these things ling out
YM bitch, now it's time to bang out

Gorilla with the flow, nigga finna blow
Ice everywhere, chinchilla to the flo'
Escalade trucks with the chromed out buggy
Type of shit I got since the nigga got paid
Nigga gained a little weight but the hoes still love me
Still let a nigga put the dick to they face
Run up in your crib, put the burner to your face
Leave the scene with out a trace at a earn hard pace
But no I ain't bail, I ain't tryna hit the wall
Tryna mack a little broad and get her back to the place
Yo man trip, I show 'em what the Ruger hold
Catch a flight to Jayville, can't miss the Super Bowl
Then it's back to the hood cause I love the streets
Better find Noah's Ark, bout to flood the streets
Young Money, that's the clan
Young Maine, I'm the man
Getting money is the plan
The Rugers don't jam

Weezy F. kinda nice with the Glock
But I'm better than that with the rock
Tryna land me a spot at the Roc
And my city got word of that
Niggas want me to hook them up with Fox
I done got young Mal off the block
Now the haters don't know where he at
Tryna do the same thing for Cap-
That's my young brother, he got shop
If a nigga try to jack
Then we coming back like Hip-Hop
Got the bullets coming out the pump
Running through your stomach back like a Running Back
I ain't got the Emmitt Smith bitch I got the Dorset
AR-33 shooting like a Cowboy

Roll with duct tape and r-r-r-r-ride with the Mack
Roll with duct tape and ride with the Mack
Roll with duct tape and r-r-r-r-ride with the Mack

Slide out the Ferrari, I came to wet up the party
And baby I can shoot like Robert Horry or Corey Maggette
Ready for the impossible, I'm colossal, fool
And y'all niggas just molecules
Don't know how to build a house but I got a box of tools
I'm talkin' 'bout that ""pop pop, pap pap, bang bang, blocka boom
That is for Tune
The coupe I'm in say ""va va voom"", then it go pe'hune
Nigga I'm gone
I'll see you soon, on the moon
Put me in the dirt and watch me bloom
Put me in the jungle, bet I'm coming back with all the food
Put me in the streets and bet I'm coming back with money
Yeah, bitch nigga run it (3x)
I'm heavily blunted, me and my gun loaded
She ridin' with me 'til the muthafuckin' road end
Yeah, and it be like that
I don't got papers on that Glock
But I got papers on that Mack


I ain't have a body on it, but don't nobody own it
So anybody can get it if anybody wants it
Homie, I'm not your homie
You fuck around and end up wrapped up
In the trunk like a fucking mummy
Phony, I'm far from phony
I'm only about my money
And I keep enough of work to feed a thousand junkies
I stay strapped cause I keep a couple thousand on me
And I know these little cronies that's plottin' on me
But I ain't never scared
I ain't never runnin'
I got my own back
I ain't never frontin'
And I'm forever thuggin'
I'm like a pair of somethin' (?)
No heart, I don't care for nothin'
And no sir, I ain't here for nothin'
Then I'm trying to bring it back like the record's jumpin'
I got my system pumpin'
And I'm riding with the Mack and the duct tape in case I gotta carry somethin'


I got real fucking blood flowing through my pulmonary veins
I play the kitchen, call me ""Culinary Maine""
Y'all niggas bitches, ya'll hustlin' on the scary train
While we move everything, from heroin to Mary Jane
But let me fall back, I know the Feds like rap
(There's an echo in the headphone)
That's how I know the mic tapped
When you don't brush your teeth
The only time you touch plaques
While we got too many on the wall
Yeah, it's like that
I got chicks that like me that don't like rap
Ask your girl who her favorite
I bet she say she like Mack
I tell a dark-skinned chick I'm allergic to chocolate
So if we eating use the plan and you can keep on walking
Hi Yellow Mamis, I don't eat red meat
I'm busy killing tracks
Yeah, this is a dead beat (rest in peace)
No child support
I pay with my heart, I kill it
I probably never be the best
But one of the realest",https://genius.com/Lil-wayne-ride-with-the-mack-lyrics

Mona Lisa (Demo),Tha Carter V (2014 Version),2019,"I got a story to tell, you know that I cherish these
Hope it ain't too many feelings involved

I see niggas in this bitch
Stuntin', poppin' bottles
Gettin' drunk with these bitches
And when they leave they get followed
Fall asleep with that bitch
And really don't know much about her
When you really should sleep with a choppa
'Cause you gon' wake up and see me with some choppas

I be with bitches that be with bitches
That be with niggas with riches
I tell 'em, ""Get him,"" they say, ""Yes, daddy""
And they don't care how we split it
And they so pretty, and their hair lengthy
He hit it and sleep on her titties
Then she give us the word, we come through with AKs
It's a stick-up, she scream like a victim
Now you feelin' so silly
I smoke color purple, I'm up in here feelin' like Celie (Ooh)
Nappy-ass dreads, what's that you say?
Watch your mouth, Milli Vanilli (Ooh)
You can get snaked, you can get faked
Out by the bitch that you feelin'
'Cause you thought that she was an angel
That bitch ain't no angel, I treat her halo like a frisbee
And you tell her your business, she tell me your business
You tell that bitch what you feelin'
All of the beans you be spillin'
To you, she lie through her teeth cavities, fillin's
She know where you hide to tell me where it's hidden
She know when you're gone, tell me when to visit
We break in your home and take the specifics
And meanwhile, the bitch is on vacation with ya
So she don't get blamed, we don't snatch chains
We find out addresses, and we don't leave messes
You'll only know that it's gone when you check it
Then your first thought is to start second guessin'
She say, ""What's wrong?"" He say, ""Nothin', keep restin'""
She say, ""What's missin'?"", ""How you know somethin' missin'?""
He scratch his head, she say, ""Get back in bed""
Then she gave him some head
Boy, you can't trust them bitches, and then she say
""Ooh, daddy, ooh,"" woo
She say, ""Ooh, daddy, ooh,"" yeah
She took off his pants and his shoes
He opened his eyes and saw that barrel goin' boom
Nigga, yeah

I see niggas in this bitch
Stuntin', poppin' bottles
Gettin' drunk with these bitches
And when they leave, they get followed
I be with bitches that know the bitches
That's with the niggas we followin'
Get them on the line, stay two cars behind
And tell them hoes, ""Don't be so obvious""
Mona Lisa, long hair, don't care
She handle the business and don't ever tell
She bite the bullet and cough up the shells
She tell 'em, ""Ooh, daddy, let's go to your place""
And if he say yeah, then we meet him there
She don't want love, she just want her share
She feed him lies with his silverware

I know a bitch named Liz
This nigga think she his 'cause she tell him that it is
So he tell her all his secrets, he tell her all his fears
And then she tell me and I be all ears
And then I go and tell my people and they already know him
And then I call Liz and she say he comin' over
I say, ""Good girl, just remember what I told ya""
She say, ""Yes, daddy"", I say, ""Girl, you're a soldier""
So we're waitin' outside
We watched him pull up, and walk up to the door
And right before he knock, she open the door naked
They started French kissin', but he didn't see moi
She left it unlocked, they didn't make it to the room
So they stopped on the couch
Music up loud with his head in the clouds
Turn that shit down and I scared the piss out of him
Piss a nigga off, shoot him dead in his frown
Nigga, turn around, I ain't here to fuck around
I ain't here to fuck around, caught you wit' your pants down
You know what it is, put your fuckin' hands up
Liz, that's enough, you can put your hands down
And then he looked dead at her and he shook his head at her
She a good actress and you a dead actor
You'll be dead after we get what we after
If Liz call you daddy, we call her a bastard, oh
I got way too many bitches that do anything for me, nigga
But think for me, nigga
Send her to you like she ain't for me, nigga
And if you alone, she bankrupts you niggas
She pour you a drink, that drink on me, nigga
She slip somethin' in it, now faint for me, nigga
Then you wake up and see guns in your face
And Mona Lisa out of frame on these niggas
Pussy got you out of character, nigga
You fall for these hoes off your ladder, my nigga
We take everything that you have 'til you don't even have an opinion
We have your attention
And now you're lookin' down a barrel though, nigga
You more terrified than a Fatter Joe, nigga
Don't be a pussy for pussy, my nigga
Don't be a asshole over pantyhoes, nigga
Quit playin'

She say, ooh, Daddy, ooh, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Ooh, fake smile, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
She say, ooh, no emotion, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Now he get the picture, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, yeah

Ah, every day she wake up with a different color makeup
And a promise he gone take her to the movie and the mall
Chillin' with the Laker, on the floor, fourth quarter
Four minute on the clock, Black Mamba with the ball
Paparazzi lookin' at 'em both poppin' up and take a picture, uh
Probably on a Internet blog
In a minute, he gon' be admittin' that he love her on his mother
Man, he want to meet her mother by tomorrow
Pussy good enough, it got him sinnin' in the walls
And he diggin' in it like he livin' in it
Make a new religion with it, man a nigga 'bout to go against God
Poetry in a pear tree
Sweet tone like a hummingbird when she asked him
Did he want to make love in a yellow taxi
Never gave two fucks, jumped in the backseat
Woke up in the morning to The Great Gatsby
Then he dogged it again like the bitch Lassie
I'm a dog in the wind, I'm a pit laughing
I'ma call up again like I did last week
Make good with the friend and I'm all jazzy
Britney with the twin and the girl Ashley
Found out that I fucked, he was unhappy
Bitch, I never let the bullshit get past me
Better yet, I wanna break up, don't you ask me
'Bout a motherfuckin' double standard, acting
Fucking on another nigga, that's a negative alone
But you sucked this dick, that's just nasty
Matter of fact, bitch, gimme your phone! (
No
)
You fuckin' with Wayne's? (
No!
)
Bitch, gimme your phone! (
No!
)
Let me, let me take this call real quick
(
… lick me like a lollipop
) He on your fuckin' ringtone?
Is that the shit that you do?
Touchin' yourself, lookin' at Kendrick videos
Jump on the internet, watchin' his interviews
I don't know what the fuck lately got into you
Tell me who love you, I bet I love harder
Forgot all the shit that I did for your daughter?
The Pampers, the Pedialyte and my momma
Daycare after school and she never did charge ya
You scandalous as fuck and I hope you blow up
You know what, I give up, let me go get my gun
I got one in the chamber I'm plannin' on aimin'
Goddammit, you know that the damage is done
Bitch I'm emotional 'cause I'm in stress
I'm not supposed to go through this, I guess
So in conclusion, since you like rappers that's killin' that pussy
I'm killin' myself

She say, ooh, Daddy, ooh, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Ooh, fake smile, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
She say, ooh, no emotion, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Now he get the picture, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, yeah",https://genius.com/Lil-wayne-mona-lisa-demo-lyrics

I'mma throw up on one of you boys
How would you like that, huh?
Get trashbags for you, cause you're garbage

It's your boy Weezy, from Hollygrove I'm still loc'in
I'm Mannie fresh from the t-shirt to the Forces
Pink got my feet wet, bitch I'm still soakin'
Steppin' out ashy, I need a little lotion
You niggas funny, you gotta be jokin'
My Glocks speak out and the bullets outspoken
I take a week out on the map of the ocean
Way in the middle of the Atlantic I'm tokin'
Just in case one of these niggas jaws open
I jaws 1-2-3-4 bow him
They say he gotta be seasick, how he spit
Keep kickin' it, but you'll never see my knee bent
They got a  that I'm deep in
Little niggas I started went off the deep end
But I ain't trippin', I just keep my gun
I got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one
I got 99 partners and a snitch ain't one
I got 99 bitches and I don't love one
My 1999 bitches I been done
In 2000 it was mine, now that's his son
Go Weezy, that's what the freaks say
He like head when he ridin' on the freeway
And them threeways on a weekday
I stopped fuckin' with a girl on her P day
I'm playin', I take you to a whole 'nother land
Get you a Tiffany band
Yo, I got one with a  band
If you're sick of me stuntin' then I hope you die sufferin'
In the city dolo most of the time
Since a nigga say I want most of the shine
I hit your head really open your mind
Rude boy dreads, I'm red smokin' a pine
I take a bath with your ho and mine
And make a little butter so it go in fine
I flow tough, you can't go with mine
Message to Miss Cita, I'm focused mom

If y'all see them boys tonight
Wait 'til they come up out of them lights
Make 'em come up off of that ice
Bring it back to the hood and flip they shit twice

Get your shit sliced
Boy, get your ho card swiped
Credit or debit pussy, I decline your life
 payin' your pipe I  Medula
Writin' to Rocafella, protectin' the mozzarella
With the toaster strudel, you niggas is noodles
I'm just tryin' to get my palms on that parmesan
You know the usual, pop smoke and neutral
Cop coke and move, no hustler 'til my boot 
We are not mutual, we are not pupils
We are not peoples, you are not eagle
You're not Cash Money or Young Money either
You're thinkin' I'mma beat you, I'm thinkin' where should I leave you
I'm legal, respected like a Visa
Kick early game to your bitch like cold pizza
Yeah, I let you know 
I am a product,  behind 'em yeah

Young Weezy Baby
Come to tell you all today about a lil’ problem I be having, oh man see its like…

When I’m down in the studio tryna make a track
My girl be at home all over my back
And every time I say that’s what I’m doing
She don’t think it’s what I’m doing
When its her that I’d rather be doing
But right now I’m in the studio making this track
My girl at home all over my back
She blowin’ up my phone
She tells me she’s alone
I say I won’t be long, let me finish this song
But right now I’m in the studio eating this track
My girl at home begging me to come back
Okay I’m coming home, and when I get home
Girl I’m gonna kill it like I’m killing this song
But right now I’m in the studio

Man just record me
And even with a equals sign you couldn’t pause me
Haha
Yeah, this is the office
Come be my secretary baby this is the office
And my office hours are 9 to 5
But you can be my 6 to 10
I’mma say it again
My office hours are 9 to 5
But you can be my 6 to 10


Man just record me
My girl at home all discombodied
Lady, but baby I’m just recording
And you gotta know I’d rather do this than party
Man, don’t get me started
You think I’m crazy, my bitch retarded
But that’s my bitch regardless
Yeah


Man, just record your boy
If I sound a lil’ pissed, disregard ya boy
My baby girl really acting like a baby sending text
Stressed, tryna make it hard for ya boy
I’m like shawty better use your toy
See a nigga never absent but I might be taughty
Lordy, Lordy, I likes to party
See I could be with two freaks about to have an orgy
Or I could be with Pamela, could be with Audrey
Instead I’m telling the engineer: “dude just record me”
And as soon as Angel records me
That’s more Gucci, more Prada, more Louie V
See every verse bring us closer to our dream house
Now we closer to the things that we dream ’bout
And when I get home I ain’t tryna go to sleep
You know I’mma dig deep but right now I’m OT in the studio",https://genius.com/Lil-wayne-down-in-the-studio-lyrics

Freak ho, specializin in givin me deep throat
Really don't care how (?) shorty

Niggas can't take it when they shake an make me rape 'em
White girls I video tape 'em and they enjoy it
They love it when everybody saw it, it's off the chain
High yellow Mexican bitches they all for brains
But watch them hoes that want the change, it's not a game
Or a short cuban ho, with a fat ass though
Bet I'll treat the bitch just like Fidel Castro

Tell me what you like, let me tell you what I like

Put the pickle in the middle, make it wiggle for y'all
Might be small, but that dick ain't little at all
I like a short thick broad, fat ass and shit
Like sassy, flip like Trina, ""Da Baddest Bitch""

Now you can ride til you feel it get a nut, get a nut
Shake for ya hood, bounce for ya baby daddy
Twerk for that nigga got you pregnant in the Caddy
Slide with the KY, hold up, pause
My bitch got thongs, yo' bitch got drawers
My chick like to swallow, yo' chick like to spit
If yo' chick was my chick I'd still love that bitch
Hold up, wait a minute, chill out, stop
My ginseng, viagra, and a strawberry pop
See I'm gettin kinda bold, won't ya bring a friend
From vagina to the asshole do it again

Yo mama loved a Tymer but now you welcome

Kill you in Harlem hit the turnpike in lower Philly
And these little niggas ain't got books in their book bags
Your next neighborhood killer might be who you look past
Get it right before you get left
And sent to the upper room cause your ass couldn't calm down
Rewind me back and you notice I'm trying to warn you
Before your collarbone be what hollows are getting torn through
Play gangasta tonight and you won't see the morn' dew
And the whole next month would be something mother mourn through
God forgive me I know Thou shalt not kill
But id rather him than Millz so if I gotta I will

I'm from New Orlean where the water never clean
So ima gonna shower in some fuckin gasoline
You fuckin with the monster everyday is Halloween
My choppers ain't no doctors but they taking out your spleen
No my riders ain't no robbers but they taking everything
From Mamas to baby Mamas to Papas and we goin to pop up with poppers and leg warmers, barrel way down my jeans
My nigga ain't no fire but I'm a blaze everything
I'm that hollygrove roster and my number 17
Eastside bitch, thats where I come up as a teen
But now I'm the man, and now I'm the man
And this is my land Lilweezyana and New Orleans In the City

H-Town sunnyside this my playground
Home of ... candy paint 808 sound
Styrofoam here it is If you make my syrup spill
Ima put my hands on you like a steering wheel
And we dont feel to kill cause this the pace to cop the work
The cop's a jerk got it so hot its comin out my shirt
You get your mama merked, You know the Glocks will squirt
Cause niggas going out the shrooms and those hoes will pop the purse
Houston Texas who harder than us
With a hundred thousand flipped dope boys get a rush
Hunch of codine and we pour it in the cup, now everybody slower than the short yellow bus
Now everybody know that the boy is the truth
Stay down I team next door to the booth
Ill tell you 16th east exits side street right past is where we roll is where you find me",https://genius.com/Lil-wayne-in-the-city-lyrics

Open up the spot
Take off her drawers, and ""let me see the cock""
""Don't stop"" Lil Weezy, Weezy ain't nothin' nice
Baguettes in my Jesus Christ, nothin' but ice
When they see me at night
Behind tints I stay high
Snatch yo' wife
Run up in her with the K-Y
But it's on man
Ever since I was born Wayne
Nigga get out of line
I get dirty like John Wayne
I'm bout stuntin', flossin'
Whatever come wit it
And I don't shoot guns
Unless they have a drum wit it
At first they wasn't wit it
Thought that I was jokin
Now I got 'em all payin attention like they owe it (Whaa?)

On the Grind,Lights Out,2000.0,"Whaaat
You can find me on the corner with stones, quarters and zones
Or dope and powder broke, and our sale's soap and flour
And most of our customers come up to us daily
Yet and still I cut this stuff crazy - a hustler, baby
What can I give you? I distribute ki's to the kings
And z's to the fiends, and ecstasy and weed to the teens
You need to see Weez - anything you like and I have 'em
From crack to Viagra, and Vicodins, Valiums
I'm the nigga they point to when you hit my av
So get all your money together, come and get my slabs
I get my cash, put some aside, and flip like half
And still enough for me to TV and deep-dish my Nav'
And you can tell the law that I say they can kiss my acid
For the white people
When I get two bricks for ten, I know the right people
And I keep a nine on my waistline
And I'mma be right on the corner, wodie - I'm gonna grind

I tell 'em, ""Whaaat!!""
You see me hustlin' on the block all the time
Sittin' at the table, breakin' ki's down to dimes
Sooner or later this neighborhood gon' be mine
Nigga, I'm tryin' to grind
I tell 'em, ""Whaaat!!""
You see me hustlin' on the block all the time
Sittin' at the table, breakin' ki's down to dimes
Sooner or later this neighborhood gon' be mine
Nigga, I'm on the grind

Nigga, y'all gon' respect Weezy, or else the tec squeezin' shots
I have your chest steamin' hot, and your sis' screamin', ""Stop!""
I hang out on the block, nigga, with rocks and weed
On the corner 'til the mornin', see the cops and flee
And if we beef, we don't beef long cause we gon' creep all night
So I hope you don't sleep all night - we on your street all night
Say, aw aw, I don't want your boy to get me shoes
Cause I spit tools, and put him tissues in his shoes
And the bricks move every followin' week
So if you need to get it, too, then holla at me - got powder or d
And I shower your streets until your av pass out
More bricks than ""The Three Lil Pigs'"" last damn house
Stack crack and lay back, and just laugh at droughts
And issue work for half and just grab that south
For real, nigga - Weezy Wee tryin' to shine
From daybreak to nightfall I'm gon' grind

Tell 'em, ""Whaaat!!""
You see me hustlin' on the block all the time
Sittin' at the table, breakin' ki's down to dimes
Sooner or later this neighborhood gon' be mine
Nigga, I'm on the grind

You see me hustlin' on the block all the time
Sittin' at the table, breakin' ki's down to dimes
Sooner or later this neighborhood gon' be mine
Nigga, I'm on the grind

Start from grams to ounces to quarters to halves to ki's
Takes seconds to minutes to hours to days and to weeks
Gotta grind, work, hustle, struggle, and get it
Gotta buy, cook it, cut it, sell it, and flip it
And I flight everyday and night from the corner to the avenue
And I'll sleep next week, man, I got yay, dope, and crack to move
Ask them dudes when Wheezy open shop, I ain't got a bag to lose
Especially if I don't like who sent 'em to me and I'mma tax a dude
Duck the Feds and drama like I duck my baby momma
Sometimes I play it sour - what you thought was yay was flour
I pull whatever for the cheddar - nigga gotta flash and floss
Drought come around, then it's jack the cost or jack the boss
Cock the gun, then I push rocks 'til I spot the sun
All day I hung the block, I see the cops and run
I'm tryin' to get rich cause I wan' shine
You can find me on the block, nigga, all the time

I tell 'em, ""Whaaat!!""
You see me hustlin' on the block all the time
Sittin' at the table, breakin' ki's down to dimes
Sooner or later this neighborhood gon' be mine
Nigga, I'm on the grind
I tell 'em, ""Whaaat!!""
You see me hustlin' on the block all the time
Sittin' at the table, breakin' ki's down to dimes

Bitch I got the cash in a rubberband
I got the Glock already cocked, boom!
Fucking with a nigga meet my muthafucking goons
Sorry for the wait Carter IV coming soon

It's Young Money mutherfucker game over
Shots leave ya body looking like she is doing yoga
And Lord knows I am a sinner pain pills for dinner
Bitch I am getting money like I got a money printer
I got a chopper and a trimmer shootin' like Jimmer
You coming in that water boy, you better be a swimmer
I ain't worrying bout ya'll, sittin' in my hole
While Miss Anita Baker say you bringin me joy
I came straight outta jail and did my thing on these boys
And we all yell 'fuck you bitch' and kept going
I am on and that's right baby
I am ain't going out this bitch without a fight baby
One request please don't bite baby

I ain't lying, I'mma shine like a nickel or a dime-and
I smoke a lot of weed to keep them bitches off of my mind
Girl stop talking that shit goin' suck a nigga dick
For a new outfit
And even if the sky come falling

I got faith in my weed man

She say all she wanna do is get wild and have fun
My hands in her panties, find a diamond in the rough
If they bottled her up, I'd be a lousy ass drunk
Tell her, ""Rivers run deep, I'd rather jog than run though""
Tell her, ""Swallow that pride, I ain't cutthroat""
Then she sit on the dick proud, like the front row
And we don't care about what you haters care about
So we don't hear about what you hating about
That's why we gon' move in a bigger ass house
With a whole bunch of rooms with no room for doubt

Not out to get nothing but bread, I said I
Slide out the whip, looking like a million bucks
Don't touch bet this fucking full clip fill ya up

Make the chef pull the stove off the hip, cook em up


If I was to let the barrel spin
None of you niggas be standing
I pull this burner out my drawers
You gonna piss in ya panties
On the block as a younging
I was working that jelly
Knew fat niggas kept bundles under their belly
I’m a motherfucking Young Money
A motherfucking Cash Money
Millionaire, Cash money Machiavelli
They say dress to kill, but I look better at it
Ready for anything, its covered like spaghetti
I’m a nice young d-boy baby
I digest your man like a t-bone baby
Keep on I got the heat on 80
At 90 I’m shooting, at 100 I’m blazin
Concrete jungle the wild-life pavement
That’s my life, my life, my life baby
Don’t get caught up in the twilight craze
Or you'll be just another highlight baby


Before I had my aim
I still had a pistol
Missing ya whole chest
Hitting ya whole temple
Like 95, 96 getting it in the rental
So short I had to sit on a pillow
Let the whole quaker sit on the griddle
Cook em up and shoot em out like missiles
Boot em up and call em out like bitches
They ain't nothing but bitches
They ain't fucking with this shit
They swinging and missing
My angle is different, they ain’t seeing me
Look into my music, that’s the window to my soul
See the g in me, long hair all black like Easy-E

Moral of the Story,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Ah-em

Baby mama say I ain't shit
Make a nigga feel like shit
Talkin' 'bout some real life shit
Goodbye letter, ""Dear Life"" shit
So if a nigga kill me, hope he mean it
I just hope I die for a reason
They probably won't miss me 'til they need me
Have problems with admittin' that they need me, Lord
I'm talkin' 'bout some real life shit
Goodbye letter, ""Dear Life"" shit
Way too concerned to be conceited
I live and I learn, then die tryna teach 'em, Lord
Die tryna reach 'em
They care more about how much I leave 'em
Where'd I leave it?
I hope I left more of an impression
And all of my blessings for my kids and Miss Cita, Lord
Just got off the phone with my son
Told him, ""You're a son of a gun""
Just got off the phone with my daughter
Told her, ""I won't hesitate to fuck a young nigga up"", Lord
My new bitch left me
She said she felt too disrespected
It made no sense to me
But not to the people closest to me
And that's why she left
My smile just left
Can't lie though, I tried though
I'll die tryin', that's a common death
We was such a team, we was chasin' our dreams
Then it stopped, now I'm outta breath
Now they try to tell me I need rest
And I’ll find love again, I ain't find it yet
Oh, but I guess it is what it is
As it appears, oh shit
There go the tears, there go the drank
There go the pills, you know the drill
Sometimes I fear who in the mirror, that nigga weird
He done died so many times and still here
Why am I here?
Dear Life
What is my reason? What am I here for, that's the question?
My children, that was easy. So easy
Sometimes our loved ones don't love us
I'm fuckin' more than I'm makin' love
Sometimes I make my rubber wear a rubber
I just tell my lady, ""Nothing's easy""
Even though I make it look easy
But understand looks are deceiving
Lookin' like I'm lookin' for some grievance
'Cause I been through way too much, don't wanna think about it
Cranky 'bout it, gotta drink about it
Gotta synchronize it, tranquilize it
Doctor ain't prescribin' what he ain't realizin'
Pain inside me got me thinkin' 'bout me
Tryna hang my body, sanctifyin'
I'm a gangsta dyin' 'cause all gangsters die
I can't deny it, you can't tame my lion
I'm a angry lion hangin' by a string
I can't describe it
Feel like a anchor tied to my finger
Got me sinkin' to the bottom of my drink
I know a lotta niggas think I got a lotta niggas
There's strength in numbers but there's honor over strength
I talked to God the other day, he say he got a nigga
So, I look death up in her eye and then I wink
It's way too real
The shit I'm talkin' way, way too real
I hope it gave you chills
The dirt under your feet could be the grave you fill
You don't know how dead you feel 'til you're dead for real
Gettin' high after I paid the bill
Lower than a Navy SEAL
Show up with them Navy guns
I hope somebody prayin' for 'em
Price tag, no mistake, somebody payin' for 'em
Ice bath when my face numb, no expression
What's the life expectancy when you don't expect shit?
Mama told me, ""Fuck the world and be so aggressive. Be so fluorescent, watch these hoes 'cause they so obsessive""
I don't get too high to look over blessings
Never come in second, make the most of your seconds
They so precious
'Cause if we could buy time every store would sell it
If you want me to read your mind, need correct spelling
I keep it real, niggas better keep it copacetic
Where the weed? I feel like I'm gettin' a sober headache
Lookin' in the mirror at the one that know me better
I was too busy to talk, I wrote an open letter

Dear Life
What is my meaning? My reason?
That's the question
I ask the reader
God bless the reader
Dear Life
What is my meaning? My reason?

No cap, jet gone, jet fuel, kept going
No cap, jet gone, get on then get left home

Ball like the playoffs
Can't take a play off, can't take a day off
Working my A' off

"The Bad, The Sad & The Hated",UnKnown,UnKnown,"No one knows what it's like
To be the bad man (When Eminem created Slim Shady)
Behind the lies (DJ Cinema)
No one knows what it's like to be hated (He really started to connect with people across the world)
To telling lonely lies (Have outraged just as many people as the won over)
(Mardi Gras)
There's a certain mystique when I speak
That you notice that's sorta unique, cause you know it's me
My poetry's deep and I'm stillmatic
The way I flow to this beat
You can't sit still
It's like tryin to smoke crack and go to sleep
I'm strapped just knowin any minute I could snap
I'm the equivalent of what would happen if
Bush rapped I bully these rappers so bad lyrically
It ain't even funny I ain't even hungry
It ain't even money you can't pay me enough
You to play me
Is cock-a-mani you just ain't zany enough
To rock with shady
My noodle's cock-a-doodle
My clock's coo-coo
I got screws loose
Yeah the whole kit and caboodle
I'm just brutal
It's no rumor I'm numeral uno
If Assuming
There's no humor in it no more
You know I'm rollin' with a swollen bowlin' ball in my bag
You need fag to come a tear a new whole in my ass
No one knows what it's like
To be the bad man
To be the sad man
Behind the lies
No one knows what it's like to be hated
To be faded
To telling lonely lies
Damn I ain't never kill nobody I promise
An I promise if you try me
You gone hafta to rewind this track
And make me go back that thing'll go 'lack''
That boy'll lay flat so flat
That act is what I perform amongst you haters
Got nina in my palm an I'm masturbatin
Black peter pan fly till I die
Wat u sayin Bathe in ape
Eve Saint - evie sue what I stay & gat me feelin'
Like scarface light the cohiba
Streets reply I look right in a four seater
You know I be high get right in the four seater
Top floor of the four seasons
Four of them whores
An they all know how to cook it up
An look I got some and only one know how ta bag
Bitch bundle up
See it's a cold world so homie bundle up
Clean on this grind full or not get your hustle up
No one knows what it's like (I know that you put a lotta pain in your music)
To be the bad man
To be the sad man (Some of it comes from def jam)
Behind the lies (bein frustratin with other niggas)
No one knows what it's like to be hated (Some of it comes from my chick pissin me the f*ck off)
To telling lonely lies (I'm feelin a lotta pain)
(Mardi Gras)
I'm dealing with some shit homie
It's in the back of my head
An it's some shit homie but I just rap it instead
See I got wolverines bones in me but
The whole worlds throwin stones at me
Like they all got a bone with me
Got a childs mother and I hate her to death
But that's my childs mother so that's my
Mate to the death it's wow how I love her for
For putting little me here
And me and her could be forever
She gonna still be there
Then it's some other niggas
I judged the character wrong but
They some other niggas
Now let's get back to the song
I gotta Drug Problem
That I ain't tending to, cause I gotta enough problems
An my solution is to stuff problems
But if something goes wrong with that
Then it's back to Pcp and so long with rap
See I'm depressed lately
But nobody understands
That I'm depressed lately
I'm sorta feeling repressed lately
So ya'll been hearin and seein me less lately
Like does anyone notice the regress lately
Look deep nigga don't I seem stressed lately
Seem disturbed alota regrets lately
Yeah
No one knows what it's like to feel these feelings like I do
An I blame you
No one fights back as hard on their anger
None of my pain in the world
Can show through",https://genius.com/Lil-wayne-the-bad-the-sad-and-the-hated-lyrics
My Reality,The Laxative,2010,"Ayo Tim, I like this
I told you I’m on some other shit
Check it

My reality is bigger than your dreams are
Got your dream girl riding in your dream car
She wants me, she wants me
Plus I got it all
Bitch tell me what you don't see

I got 25 lighters on my dresser
Got the girl and a girl to undress her
My guitar strap is leather
My life is better than ever
I got women all up in my condo
And my drug dealer comes pronto
Got a registered pistol in the console
So, so, don't try me now
Don't try me now (now)

Yeah just riding feeling lovely
You can hate but your girlfriend loves me
Yeah I'm too G like a Gucci belt
Hot Gudda baby girl, I can make your coochie melt
I keep your lady wet like she took a dip
And if you looking for her, you can follow the drip
I'm slick like Rick, the ladies pulling my wrist
I just walk in the spot and out with my pick
I'm gone like a trip with a nice thick redbone
On the phone getting head, call it headphone
Pimping all over like Ludacris
These hoes love me, I'm wanted like a fugitive
(hahaha, yeah)
x2

What do you not see? You must be blind


What you need, contacts?
Tell me what you don’t see
What you can’t tell, I’m everything that he won’t be
Talking about your boyfriend, bitch you need a man friend
Even when you ain’t sittin' down you can’t stand him
Dirty dick bandit, luxury car whipper
Crib on Dolphin Island, backyard full of flippers
This is my reality, your man just be dreamin’
Wake up in the morning, bedsheets full of semen
I mean he’s wet dreaming, while me I really do it
Coulda, shoulda, woulda, baby girl you shoulda knew it
And fuck the paparazzi, I don’t ever kiss and tell
I’ll be your genie out the lamp or your wishing well
I’ll be your fishing pail and you can be my yacht buddy
Take you from A-Z, I’ll connect the dots hunny
Day viewers got money, baby cause I got money
I like it the B-5050, what you got for me?
It could be some bread, nah it ain’t gotta be cash
I’ll take a little head or I’ll take a lotta ass
I’ll take a friend or two, we can have a 3D weedy
I could toss you a Gudda Gudda or Lil Weezy, Weezy
Or my nigga Peedy Weedy, or my nigga Tity Tity
Fuck you on the hood of red strip and green Lamborghini
Go head and take this x-pill, that there buck you up
Probably have you walking round like “Damn, what the fuck”
Lady in streets but in the sheets girl you such a slut
Smash you on a top bunk, that’s a banger uppercut
And everyday we do brunch, everyday we do lunch
You do me, I do you
Baby we could do us and I ain’t gotta say no more
I don’t talk too much
Thus far, phew I feel like I’ve been trying to sell a car
Is you buying?

Haa, cause I ain’t got no time for a test drive
Do you want to go with me to the final frontier?
Don’t you see, I have everything but fear
This is not a dream, no this is real",https://genius.com/Lil-wayne-my-reality-lyrics

Don't forget the baby is what I tell the pilot
Don't forget the liquor store is what I tell the driver
Twenty dutchmasters and straight level vodka
I can pedal backwards and still move forward
Look under the mattress, you might find four of 'em
I can go though the atlas without touring
I can fuck an actress and never been in movies
Chea. I'm a cutie, An offspring of mamas beauty
I did overtime, I took papas duty
I'm a man in every sense, I got cents
Since I got rich I got tints on every Bent'
Since I know tension come out them like vents
I vent, and show no relent, money well spent
I'm a hell raiser, blaze a L right in
Front of the laws, I'm tougher than yall
Never really had a pop, so I never had to check in
But I get enough checks, I fuck around and check him
Look, check him out, these is Evisus
America ain't even let them out (ha ha)

Whisper in ya ear this Wayne pussy, say it back girl
Now she in the whip with homes
He listening to the same songs I fucked her on
Yeah. I lay back, I'm comfortable
Yeah. Weezy baby boy, lazy boy
Yeah. I did my service in the Navy
Now I'm just a veteran, they forever pay me
Dig me like a shovel, Mama I'm a rebel
I come from under that rock and turned into a pebble
Baby I'm trouble, so turn up the treble

Niggas that's 'bout beefin' - lettin' them K's spark
Knockin'-it-off-your-shoulder soldiers - them real niggas
Niggas who did time - hard-to-kill niggas
How you live, you get it is the way a nigga play it
Niggas ain't fightin' no more - niggas bustin' your head
Sendin' you to your grave - it's do or die, cousin
Aimin' straight for your head, makin' sure you die, cousin

Ridin' four deep strapped with choppers and macks
Not givin' a fuck, gettin' your cut, lettin' it bust
You get hit, that's on you, my nigga - you're outta luck
You're stuck like chuck - wodie, you're assed out

I was wrong for a lot of shit that I'mma take to my grave
Continuously whippin' niggas like a runaway slave
Must was meant for me to be thuggin' - I stay in some beef
Baby and Slim keep tellin' me, ""Juvenile, stay off them streets.""
I can't help - I draw attention; they be fuckin' with me
I'm hot in the ass and can't get enough of these streets
A lil' nigga in the Rolls screamin', ""Fuck the police!""
Peelin' out in front the club, about to duck to the east
Now play yourself, you gon' find yourself by yourself
In a nice place ducked off with fucked up health
I done been strucked and snuck, but never fucked and stuck
My life is four hundred degrees, so I bust 'em up
Still stickin' to the g-code, Ree's, and B's
Quit drinkin', but I will smoke some weed indeed
All they understand is my project English
And if you don't like it, you can kiss my penis

You a killer, nigga? (Eah?) Ain't no fear in my heart
I'll go toe to toe with ya or take ya to war
I'll even go K for K with ya - now make your choice
Better know when I'm in beef that I be creepin', nigga
Better know that I'm a snake, and I'mma sneak ya, nigga
Each time I hit the corner, I be leavin' niggas
Momma upset - can't even go on and grievin', nigga
Nothin' change - I'm on TV, I don't play with you niggas
Still the same that'll spin broad day on you niggas
And empty a hundred out that K
Where you're caught hangin' is where you're left stankin', ya heard me
I've been in the game - niggas know what I'm 'bout
So many murders under my belt, I done lost count
If you wanna be another number, my nigga
Go ahead, drop your nuts, and run up, my nigga

Hello, world
I zip through fast in a yellow pearl drop Porsche Boxter
Young mobster, wild and obnoxious
Pop some in your dreadlocks - What? Me not no rookie, boy
Glock cookin', boy
I'll turn your forehead to a pussy, boy
Off the gate, cousin, you niggas gon' make me stalk and spray somethin'
Spark or lace somethin'
Park the car, get out, walk, and spray somethin'
Taught to stay thuggin' brought up in this shit that we call America
And in my hood the laws are scared of us - we are too terrible
If I live to be old, it's a miracle
Cause the way a nigga hatin' or bitch plottin', the shit's hysterical
That's why I keep me two big guns on blast like a stereo
Come to your burial and kill anybody else who care for you
Don't blame me, society changed me
You haul white, you smash powder all night for the fast dollar
Cut off lights, we masked riders
The hood trash got us in a position we can't shake
With bars we can't break, and due to that you ain't safe, bitch

We done hit you up, lit you up, twist you up (Ooohh!)
Now, we done chopped you up, popped you up, boxed you up (Ooohh!)
Look, we done hit you up, lit you up, twist you up (Ooohh!)
Now, we done chopped you up, popped you up, boxed you up, nigga (Ooohh!)

We hit you up, lit you up, twist you up (Ooohh!)
And we done chopped you up, popped you up, boxed you up (Ooohh!)

Niggas talkin breezy n run outta breath n get weezy
Thinkin those messages is for themmm jus because they been gettin cc'ed
You wanna BATTLE dog? Fuck that, lets compare catalogs...
Compare bank accounts, compare travel logs, compare passports, n THEN have a talk

Cos the niggas who ain't got cars will tell you they rather walk...Haa!
Yall niggas is avatars....to be honest, I ain't even mad at ch'all
You pour ya cup n mafuckas jus rather grab a straw.....
They like fiends, the way they rock back n forth

Niggas can't act mature.....
N everybody think they TU-pack Shakurs
Niggas brave after two packs a Coors, Two packs? OF COURSE

And I probably am so I dont knock em

With an ol' school bitch, she got on door knockers
And she knock on your door for that raw partner
Hollygrove Wayne, that boy a monster
Jacked for a Mazda come back in Mase-rati
Like how he? Why he? Cause I be
Moving through the city like an I.V
Tryna be monogamous but I got bitches on my dick
Like I'm the shit cause I'm the shit
So I only promise this: to my little girl I will give you the world
And to my unborn I'm tryna reason with ya moms so
If I'm not with her when you get here, its already clear
Yeah, and for their sake I'm a ball every year
I'm a pause every tear
And tattoo it on my face
Niggas know, that I got that black music on my waist
Make me put it to your ear and get that b-b-b-b-bass
Bluka bluka to ya face, closed casket
Mama can't remember shit but last saturday, what a tragedy
Flowers for the family
Powder in my nap sack
Running through the projects, tryna get a stack back
I got my SK bout to get my MAC back to pap pap at niggas who yap yap
Yup yup! and I rep that 17 hard, you know
'til a nigga ain't nothing but tomb quotes
Raw Tune, who you know go harder than dude
See these is the clues, part of my shoes
I bleed with them dudes I'm part of the crew
Don't move cause you right in the route of the gun mouth
When it talk, you know what come out- barreltone
Nigga y-y-young Wayne from out Carrollton
Yeah, I got my eyes on the sparrow
Though my path is narrow, my angels are shadows
I saddled up, and get the fucking battle
Automatics up, like nigga fuck whoever
You touch and reach, you get fucking bleached
Above the law niggas put you underneath
You call the law nigga? You fucking leech!
You Saved by the Bell, you fucking Screech
My bucket screech through the streets like a R&B singer
You ain't pimping until you fuck a R&B singer
I walked in this building with all these bangers
And all these niggas look like targets to me
What's a drought to you may be a bargain to me
Cause I just may be sitting on a carton of Ki's
I got important people thats trying to market me
So I'm gon' stop talking 'bout the white, Sike!
I know I'm not walking without a fight
So I'm swinging with all my might
We can go all night
I'm a blow all day, and I'm a blow all night
Do a verse today and do a show tonight!
Fuck a ho today, and fuck a ho tonight!
Im' a live my life like there's no tonight
I might go tonight so mama pray don't cry
Cause your prayers maybe working, mama they gon' try
Yeah,and we rock to the same lullaby
Nigga I got 10, nigga I got 5
I hope you got yours, cause nigga I got mine

Gone ’Til November (Excerpt),UnKnown,UnKnown,"Day One Up in This Bitch!
I’ve never been one who doesn’t take full responsibility for his actions, but damn, I really don’t deserve this. If I hadn’t traded my blue Marc Jacobs jeans, white polo, and gray Vans for green onesies, I wouldn’t have believed this shit myself.
I had to talk to the prison psychiatrist when I got here. I told her that I shouldn’t be talking to her because I’m not crazy … but I ended up really enjoying her conversation. Is that crazy? We talked about traveling the world, where we’ve been and where we would like to go, BUT both of us were in jail … crazy!
My next conversation didn't go so well. As I was being led to the captain's office, I was still just trying to figure out what I was about to go through. I got lost in the thought of how each step that I made was one step farther from everything that I love. And to what? A world of dysfunction, disrespect, and distrust. Come to think of it, it is sort of like the music biz only without the female groupies.
As soon as I sat down in the captain's office, his exact first words to me were, ""Don't fuck with my staff!"" Damn! Definitely won't be getting any celebrity treatment from the captain. The whole conversation was him telling me, “Don't come in here trying to be what you are. You're not gonna ‘Lil Wayne’ up this mothafucka!”
All I was thinking was, Since there's nothing else to explain here, I'm done with this dude, so just take me to my cell and I'll stay out of your way. After the captain's great words of discouragement, I was handed a towel, two sheets, a toothbrush, toothpaste, and a green cup. Oh yeah, and a cell, cell 29.
As soon as I heard the cell door lock behind me, I just sat on the back wall and the tears began to flow as I took my first glimpse at my new digs: three buckets, one bed, one toilet that was surprisingly kind of clean (emphasis on kind of), a rusty-ass sink with a mirror the size of a small notepad, a desk, and a window. A clothesline was left hanging in the cell. I decided to leave it because I figured it would come in handy.
I got in just in time for chow, which is the overall term used for what they call breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I only ate the veggies because I wasn't too sure what the other stuff was.
I wasn't in the mood to do much socializing, so I kept the first-day meet and greet short. I guess not everybody on staff got the captain's memo because two C.O.’s were suspended for trying to come up and see me ... females of course. Maybe there will be some female groupies in the bitch after all.
Fuck ... one down!
Welcome 2 Da Family
Woke up at 4 a.m. for breakfast ""chow."" I had coffee that was given to me along with some other ""goodies."" The guys on my tier made me feel like I was a part of a family ... like a brotherhood. I was the new brother and they showed me love just like one. All in all, they gave me magazines, tea, some better soap than the prison's soap, an earphone radio, and extra chow.
There's Chris, who gave me the radio. He looks 15 years old, like he's in here for stealing gum. There's Lawson, who gave me the magazines and taught me how to use the phone. Twenty-one minutes every five hours. Sheesh!  There's Herb. He gave me some advice on how to do this time. Shit like, make sure to stick to myself, and to create a daily regimen to keep myself busy every day. He suggested working out, but I know my body ain't built for that. There's Al, whose cell is across from mine. He's 50-something, but he acts 20-something. Reminds me of an old Mafia guy. Then there's Coach! The guy that likes guys ... you know it had to be one of those. But he can and will get anything you need. I guess you can call him a ""sweetheart,"" haha!
Now, as far as the C.O.’s, there's one who really stood out. White dude. He's loud, funny, and mad cool. He kept it so real with me from the jump, like, “Stay away from all these bitch-ass niggas ... none of them are your friends.” Him being a C.O., he knew why everybody was up in this bitch. Let's just say that he pointed out all the dudes who became gangstas mysteriously overnight when they found out that I was coming ... haha!
And then there's Ms. Burke. Owwww! She's so sexy! She has a head full of gray hair, but she's not old. I'm not sure what caused it, but she said that her hair has been gray since she was 13. My first impression was that it's just her swag and she dyed it gray on purpose. That's how cool it looks on her. I mean she's fine as hell. I'd definitely hit it!
Still Got It!!!
Shot hoops with Al in the yard. I sucked. He was much better and he's 57! No sooner when I got back to the cell at 2:45 p.m., I was back out to take the test for the suicidal-protection aide job. I passed with a 100, no lie. Guess I still got it. And I guess I still get that moola, baby, because SPA is the highest-paying job an inmate can get. The job is basically to monitor the tier for an eight-hour shift and if someone wants to hang up (meaning to kill themselves), to not negotiate with them or try to talk them out of it, but just to alert an officer. Yeah, it's that real.
When I got back to the cell, I wrote some rhymes and did some push-ups until about 4:30. Ended up playing checkers with Dominicano. Lost!
Then I had to get ready for my visit, which was Tez, Mack, and E.I. That was a great visit. I miss them niggas. Had chow when I got back. It was this chicken special that Coach and LL make. Shit was great! Also made my own rice and noodles with it and put it on a tortilla wrap. Shit was awesome. I felt fat.
Used the phone cautiously. Spoke to my little man D.M.C. III, he said, “Da-da.” Fucked up that I had to hear it for the first time in here, but still, Yeah!
Showered up quickly then had tea. It's 10:45 p.m. and I'm back in my cell listening to a game in the earphones as I write this.
Push-ups, prayer, sleep. Another day gone!
Jailhouse Rap
Read fan mail. Got some nice pictures today and Marisa sent me some Marc Jacobs cashmere socks, yeah!
Some people write the most bugged-out things. Everything from wanting to fall asleep with my dick in their mouth, to that I rep my city “astronomically”! Crazy, man! I love it! Also read the new Rolling Stone and I was in it. Yeah!
I rapped for the first time on the yard for Charlie and Jamaica. It's crazy that I've performed in front of millions of people since I was 8 years old, but for some reason I was nervous as hell. Rapping has always been second nature to me, but my creativity has definitely been put to a test since being in this bitch. I absolutely refuse to rap about being in jail. It's not who I am AND it's not who I'm going to be! I hope they liked it. I think they did.
Chris gave me two bags of Doritos. I gave him some bubble gum. It wasn't a trade, just two generous guys. But yeah, someone blessed me with some gum, a Now and Later, and a Jawbreaker today. Yeah!
As a Man
I woke up still feeling fucked up about the fucked-up day that I had. Hell is what it was! I'm used to arguing with my girl on a daily basis, but finding out that she fucked Drake was the absolute worst thing I could've found out.
As a man, honestly, that shit hurt, and not because it was Drake. It could've been any man and it would've hurt the same. She said it happened way before we got together, but she just never told me. When Drizzy came to see me, he was like, ""Yeah it's true ... don't fuck with her like that ’cause I did fuck her."" Damn!
This is the type of shit that a man never wants to find out while he's locked up. Or maybe so, ’cause only God knows what I would've done if I wasn't locked up right now. As soon as I found out, I told them to just lock me in, and I've basically just been by myself in my cell for the last couple of days.
Not sure how long I would've stayed in there if it weren't for Charlie. His fat ass wasn't going to let me just sit up in this bitch and not eat. He was like, ""I don't give a fuck what you're mad about, we cooking no matter what, nigga. Come on man, let's eat!""
As a man I'll admit it: That shit really fucked me up, but hey, fuck that ho!
Love is blind, that's why I say make sure that bitch is a seeing-eye dog.
Another one gone!
He Runs the City
I woke up feeling like today was going to be different for some reason. I couldn't put my finger on it, but there seemed to be a buzz in the building. I had my morning coffee like usual and chilled in the dayroom waiting on my visit. And what a great visit it was. Diddy kept his word and visited me today. It was total chaos! Every captain in the building was down there! Even the deps and the warden! Everyone just wanted to see him. It was kind of aggravating, but it is what it is.
Here No More
Today started out on some regular-day shit, but that's definitely not the way it ended. Jamaica got deported. We were just chilling in this bitch and they just came and got him like he had a visit. The only difference was, they were like, ""Jamaica, pack up your shit."" Damn!
The fucked-up thing is that Jamaica and I have become ... damn, do I dare use the ""F"" word in jail ... but really have become like friends. He was always asking me if I could help him out with a lawyer or something just to keep him here because he was facing deportation.
At first, I would just brush it off, but it got to the point that I reacted as if he were one of my homies that I grew up with. I was like, “Nigga, don't ask me for shit just because you know I got it. It's because of me that we're eating right up in this bitch. Don't stretch it by asking for a lawyer and shit.” That's really how I looked at it at the time. I really didn't know it was that serious. I guess he really did need a better lawyer. Damn!
The whole ordeal made me realize how there are no real friends in jail. As fucked up as that sounds, that's the reality. I remember when White told me that. He was like, ""Y'all niggas can be as cool as you want in here. You niggas can fight together, eat together, play ball together, and all that shit. But nobody ever gets out of this bitch on the same day. And whoever gets out of this bitch first ain't worrying about nobody ass that still up in here.""
I pray for everybody in here, but I really don't see myself keeping in touch with anybody but a couple of C.O.’s who never acted like dicks toward me.
What a day … at least it's another one gone!
What's Really Real
Damn, I woke up this morning missing having normal conversations about everyday shit. The only time that I can have anything close to a normal conversation is with a C.O. I can't even begin to try and have that type of convo with an inmate because they're always lying about whatever they're talking about.
I'd have to be the most gullible mothafucka on the planet to believe the stories that these niggas tell me up in here. I mean like everybody in this bitch is a king, a boss, or a killer ... Everybody either has or has had a billion dollars. It's kind of sad because I know that they're just trying to boost their egos, which is probably why most of these mothafuckas are in here in the first place. Your life has to be crazy as fuck when jail is the place to boost your ego.
I don't ever want to come back to this bitch! There's absolutely nothing cool about jail. It's nasty. It's dirty. Everything is fucking used. Getting something new in the bitch is like winning the lottery. You have to be a certain mothafucka to get new shit. And since I get new bedsheets and shit, it's a good thing that I'm that certain mothafucka!
When I got back from the yard, I just stayed on the phone as much as possible. I was really craving some normal conversation. I'm sure this was all caused by this dude telling me to slow down because I was beginning to act like an inmate.
I got into an argument on the yard and went straight gorilla. I was as un–Lil Wayne as I could get. I was in a nigga face like, Fuck you, nigga, what's good? Niggas had to hold me back and shit. That's when this dude was like, ""You go home to something nobody else in here goes home to ... dude, leave that nigga alone. He'll be back in this bitch next month. You don't want to be back in this bitch, man. Don't act that way. Go home, bro. You're a millionaire. You're a superstar. So act like one."" I couldn't argue with that shit ... damn ... and yeah!
The Remix, Baby
Who knew that my spirit was about to be lifted through the roof! Tez was like, “We want you to be on Drake's remix.” I was like, “How?” And he was like, “We're going to do it over the phone.” I'm like, “Shit ... I don't have anything else better to do up in this bitch, so let's go!” After I finished running it, I was kinda nervous on how it was going to be received. This was the first time that I haven't been in the studio to hear the playback before a song goes out.
I can't front, I'm really bugging out knowing that I can record a song AND it would be on the radio and everything. My main thought is, Damn ... if I can do this, I'm about to go to the studio every night. I told Tez to have the mic on standby from here on out.
Nothing else that happened today mattered. Nothing can touch how happy I am. My creativity is at an all-time high right now! I'm actually looking forward to tomorrow.
Writing, writing, and more writing! Another one!
So Blessed
Just got back from my visit. I have the best friends, fans, and family in the world. I've been in this bitch for a good minute now and have never missed a visit yet. You get two visits a week and I haven't missed one yet! That shit is incredible ’cause I've never seen Jamaica get a visit. The only visit I saw him get was the mothafuckas who deported his ass came and got him. Coach has never got a visit. Dominicano has never got a visit. Charlie has never got a visit. I got every visit I was supposed to get. I've been able to look forward to seeing someone every chance I was able to see someone ... THANK GOD!
I even feel blessed when I argued with my girl during visits because it would become the topic of my day. And by the time we spoke later that day, the argument was so amplified in my head that I couldn’t wait to jump on the phone with her. Being that she was dealing with real-life shit and not up in the hellhole, she would normally have forgotten about the whole thing and be on some ""I love you, Baby"" vibe ... I'm like, BITCH!!! That shit might sound crazy, but it's awesome to have something to look forward to that takes your mind out of being in jail!
I told her I didn't want her to wear any panties so I can look at her pussy and shit one time. But since I never wear the same T-shirt, boxers, or socks more than one time EVER, my nigga E.I. always brings me new T-shirts, boxers, and socks every visit. And they have these extensive-ass searches before you come in here, so they made her put on a pair of boxers because they knew she didn't have on panties. Damn!
I have to give props where props are due ... big shout-out to Diddy, Chris Paul, and Kanye for coming to see me, especially with their schedules. I know that they had to go through some extra shit, because you just can't walk in this bitch and say, ""I want to see Dwayne Carter.”
It's lock-in, so push-ups, Bible, prayer, slow jams, and sleep. Another one!",https://genius.com/Lil-wayne-gone-til-november-excerpt-annotated

I'm so fresh, like sex in the sheets
But I'm from the dirty dirty, like sex on the beach
The checks on my Nikes they match my carneesh
The button up shirt match my button seats
The AK-47 match my fuckin' heat
Watch your fuckin' feet cause I'm hot in the streets
A quarter thing is how i got in the streets
I had money ever since that week, young Weezy!


17 gangsta, Hollygrove solider
Got a lil money, got a lot more colder
My top don't roll up, it fold up
My money don't fold up, it build up
You niggas ain't fly, get your gear up
Copped my bitch the Mark Jacob boots, and the ear muffs
Got her lookin' like Kamora or somethin
Brought Kamora to the South now Kamora stuntin'
Yeah we big business pimpin', chyea
Walkin' wit a limp, talkin' with a slur
Barkin' at ya' bitch, bet her pussy cat purr

Moral To The Story (Open Letter Demo),Tha Carter V (2014 Version),2019,"Baby momma say I ain't shit
Make a nigga feel like shit
Talkin' 'bout some real life shit
Goodbye letter, ""Dear Life"" shit
So if a nigga kill me, hope he mean it
I just hope I die for a reason
They probably won't miss me 'till they need me
Have problems with admittin' that they need me, Lord
I'm talkin' 'bout some real life shit
Goodbye letter, ""Dear Life"" shit
Way too concerned to be conceited
I live and I learn, then die tryna teach 'em, Lord
Die tryna reach 'em
They care more about how much I leave 'em
Where'd I leave it?
I hope I leave more of an impression
And all of my blessings for my kids and Ms. Cita, Lord
Just got off the phone with my son
Told him, ""You're a son of a gun""
Just got off the phone with my daughter
Told her, ""I won't hesitate to fuck a young nigga up"", Lord
My new bitch left me
She said she felt too disrespected
It made no sense to me
But not to the people closest to me
And that's why she left
My smile just left
Can't lie though, I tried though
I'll die tryin', that's a common death
We was such a team, we was chasin' our dreams
Then it stopped, now I'm outta breath
Now they try to tell me I need rest
And I’ll find love again, I ain't find it yet
Oh, but I guess it is what it is
As it appears, oh shit
There go the tears, there go the drank
There go the pills, you know the drill
Sometimes I fear who in the mirror, that nigga weird
He done died so many times but still here
Why am I here?

Dear Life
What is my reason?
What am I here for? That's the question
Hmm, my children
That was easy, so easy, uh

Loved ones say I don't love 'em
Make a nigga feel like nothin'
A bitch said we never make love
Make a nigga feel like fuckin'
I just tell my kids, ""Nothing's easy""
Even though I make it look easy
But understand looks are deceiving
Smokin' all this motherfuckin' weed
'Cause I been through way too much, don't wanna think about it
Cranky 'bout it, gotta drink about it
Gotta synchronize it, tranquilize it
Doctor ain't prescribin' what he ain't realizin'
Pain inside me got me thinkin' 'bout me
Tryna hang my body, sanctifyin'
I'm a gangsta dyin' 'cause all gangsters die
I can't deny it, you can't tame a lion
I'm a angry lion hangin' by a string
I can't describe it
Feel like a anchor tied to my finger
Got me sinkin' to the bottom of my drink
I know a lotta niggas think I got a lotta niggas
There's strength in numbers but there's honor over strength
I talked to God the other day, he say he got a nigga
So, I look death up in her eye and then I wink
It's way too real
The shit I'm talkin' way, way too real
I hope it gave you chills
The dirt under your feet could be the grave you fill
You don't know how dead you feel 'til you're dead for real
And I'm higher than a cable bill, lower than a Navy SEAL
Show up with them Navy guns
I hope somebody prayin' for 'em
Price tag, no mistakes, somebody payin' for 'em
Ice bath when my face numb, no expression
What's the life expectancy when you don't expect shit?
Mama told me, ""Fuck the world and be so aggressive
Be so fluorescent, watch these hoes 'cause they so obsessive
I don't get too high to look over blessings
Never come in second, make the most of your seconds
They so precious""
'Cause if we could buy time, every store would sell it
And I never leave my grind, that bitch so magnetic
I keep it real, niggas better keep it copacetic
Where the weed? I feel like I'm gettin' a sober headache
Lookin' in the mirror at the one that know me better
I was too busy to talk, I wrote an open letter

Dear Life
What is my meaning? My reason?
That's the question
Hmm, my children
That was easy, so easy
Yeah",https://genius.com/Lil-wayne-moral-to-the-story-open-letter-demo-lyrics

Trap stars with the dough, mami we be running through it
Now Weezy got my dough bigger
If your woman in the club then homeboy you better get her
Cause I'll take her in a minute Imma dog her when I finish

Operate On Me,The Drought is Over 4,2007.0,"Prada jeans... 300 dollars
Gucci slippers... 500 dollars
Spending all your money to make these white folks rich... Priceless

They said opposites attract, so here I am
With my pistol in my pocket, hidden right under my jacket
They said opposites attract, so here she is
With a Masters and a Bachelor, she just became a doctor
Operate on me, I need that open heart surgery
Cause the way my heart is feelin', I can't make it through the night
Operate on me, I need that open heart surgery
Cause the way my heart is feelin', I can't make it through the night

Pocket full of money and some dark shades
Flow so current, he can start waves
Game like butter, he Parkays
Love me some head like chardays
Coppin' quarters like the arcade
Get high with my animals in our cage
And you can see us if you star gaze
Creole boy, baby I sautees
On your mark, ready, start race
That's just you makin' my heart race
And I may be the opposite, but I'mma let you operate


And I know she want a D-boy
So I'mma pop up on her like 
I got that magic, like Bruce Leroy
And if this isn't it, then love has a decoy
Her body sicker than a retard
And I bet I got the medicine she need for it
And i bet I got the medicine to keep goin'
She shoots me with happiness, and I bleed joy
No Band-Aid for me boy
A loss of blood, yeah the girl got me weak boy
Yeah, I see you, and I see you
When I see you, girl, you're the one, can I be two?
And if your love is clear, then I see through
Then they yell ""clear,"" and I pull through
You saved my life, baby I would too

Go down girl, give head, go down
Now go down, girl, give head, go down
Go down girl give head
Now, momma's a hoe met her at a video with her face ready to go waiting for cameo
She say, i can tell you hustle, i can smell the coke
The money, you got a lot, i can smell the dough
I told her, keep her nose outta business of grown folks
She been to New Orleans twice never been through the Grove
Now her pocketbook nice, and her dress coal
But her teeth pearly white and her lips was swole
She bad, have you seen her?
My n*gga said I might aswell marry a diva, like Trina, I pleased her, she please me the same, hey
What's the beauty without the brain?
Now go down girl, give head, go down Go down girl, give head, go down Now go down, girl, give head, go down Go down girl give head
Right on the club, right in the club, shorty popped an x and gave me head right in the club
To be honest, I don't think we gonna go to my truck cause her cousin's with her and she looking better than her
Yeah, she's fat in the ass, slim in the waist, kinda pretty and she down to take the shit in the face
Licking all on her lips, cause she love how I taste
It's dripping on her chin, hope it don't fall on my ???
Yeah, I'm glad I found ya, can't wait to bring Wayne and Mack Maine around ya
Gave me head in the pool and I damn near drowned her
Before I'd kiss that hoe, I'd rather kiss a perahna
Now go down girl, give head, go down Go down girl, give head, go down Now go down, girl, give head, go down Go down girl give head
Now I ain't saying she a dick sucker, but she ain't bout to get a kiss from us
Now I ain't saying she a dick sucker, but she ain't bout to get a kiss from us
Now go down girl, give head, go down Go down girl, give head, go down Now go down, girl, give head, go down Go down girl give head
All my little divas, pay attention, just listen
If we ain't in Paris, then we ain't French kissin'
I'm tryna feel your tounge, I'm just tryna be the one
Give it to ya from the back and make you cough up a lung
Or give a little brain and cough up a sun
I bust two times and then I toss up a one
Now shake it baby, it took your momma 9 months to make you baby
Enter the bedroom, we won't make a baby
Get your kneee pads on, no skating baby
So get your aprons baby

Smoking the good marijuana, man

We was raised by

Satan, Hellraiser
Stunt like Jason Statham, the J's awaiting, that's my crazy patients
I got what they craving, they place the payment just to taste their favorite
Now I got 'em raving about my latest, you should check the ratings
Separate destinations for the extras making extra paper
Never giving statements to the agents during interrogation
Well aware with proper preparation skipping devastation
Devil never sleep, no sedation until heaven make us
Dreaming 'bout being in better places until hell awake us
We well aware of jealous haters with their allegations
Don't need them to validate us, need their gals to date us
Need their girls to serenade us with their salivators

That's your bitch asking to come over, she shall overcome
Oh look my homies showing up, your homies know what's up
It's gon' take some cojones, hope and luck to cope with us, look
We hung right by that corner store with pumps, a lot of dope and bucks
And opened up that box Pandora shut like, keep it closed for what
We keep our noses up to smell the beef
Smell like a rose to us
And all roses must die slow as fuck, we speed it up
We slow it up because we pour it up, you know we pour it up
Trying to coexist with older thugs got us growing up
Knowing much but never know enough, now we loading up
Secret code of trust, keep us holding up and bold and tough
Chin high, eyes forward, shoulders up, protocol, overall
Fight like there’s no tomorrow, soldier (Soulja) boys, you!
Boy you just fuel to all of my fools
I give you little dudes the slaughterhouse rules
Pardon my drool but yall look like food
All that I do is charter my moves
Sparkle my jewels, harbor my goons
I'm hard on my boos cause all they wanna do is come to my room and walk on my moon
All these lil dudes wanna walk in my shoes
And argue about news that’s all about Tune

My Miami hideaway ocean view will catch you
I bring sand to the beach and still build a castle, nigga
You turn hoes off I take those on
A magnum latex goes on the pace goes on
I take a bitch to a island you take a ho to the mall
I holler once and shake a ho to the alphasician

Icey white sneaks ice is bright over the same black tee
I sit down at night over cheese cake and black tea
And don't think I just think it
Hit a track and I stink it
You ain't met a nigga like me in while my type extinct, bitch
That's like Noah with no arc
They calling my thoughts the Maxwell house so dark
Step up on the mound with no bark
Pedro Martinez with my mean ass
No matter how old a nigga
I Peter Rolle a nigga
I Fish Pole a nigga
I beat a hole in a nigga
Either holding a pistol or I'm holding a gun
You rolling with me?
Niggas is fraud I got the exposure with me
Yeah niggas is broads ho in they features
And a war paint script in my face to let em' know I'ma creature

Gimme that watch, gimme that chain
Empty them pockets and pay the toll
I hang with killas out on parole
Catch ya cut, run and hide
Evacuate, murder-for-hire
Kinda like Omar from the wire
We'll chop ya up like garlic cloves
And cook ya ass, like Elmer the chef
Take ya last breath, put on ya vest
But I'm aimin at'cha head boy, not'cha chest
Now pack the iron, I'll start'cha dyin
Hit them legs and crease ya up
Then I hit the spot with a bad bitch
That'll slob a knob and piece me up
And when ya wake up, in the morning
To the sounds of them choppers roaring
I wear the heat, just like Alonso
We'll leave ya whole family in mourning
I'm in the hood like wig shops
I'm on the grind, on the block
Posted up like Yao Ming
In a low post, I'm on the box
We'll chop ya up like a Screw tape
And have ya hollerin like the Opera
But with my side-kick goin off
I ain't talkin about no T-Mobile partna

And you still can see the grill wit the lights burn out
Nothin' lil' about the wheels on my bright orange drop
I'm thuggin and pimped out, flossin and glissed out
Sit my arm in warm water, I'm thawin my wrist out
Got quarters in this house, ki's in that van
Got ounces in her ride, and G's in that bag
Shhh, You hear that, here come Weezy on his way in a platinum leer jet
We gamblin' nigga bet, bet nigga disrespect and he get dampled and wet
Whole goddamn family get trampled wit that

Alright I bounce for the 17 and jump for the Grover

Slump the bitch over, cum on her shoulder
Bet I make the slut eat it up like yogurt
Wrists is ferocious, dick is just bogus
Fuck a ho watch she come back like a chorus
Like one named Deloris met her in a taurus
She like to snort coke, you should see the size her nose is
We really the ones controllin', no choices
And we got Guns and Roses, Rolls Royces
Beefin' ain't fake, not to mention
All our rides are dubbed like blank tapes
I really think my jewelry and lights have somethin' in common
Cuz everytime you put them bitches on they start shinin'
The shit is mind blowin'
As a matter of fact I got a bitch that's mind blowin'
She give my head a blow job, I guess she's mind blowin'

We done came this far, I'm so proud of my niggas
Every house I got came with a lounge for my niggas
I make mountain tops fall to the ground for my niggas
Hit your town with my niggas
Shut it down with my niggas
We fucked the same bitch, that's a pound with my nigga
I'ma let my nigga shine, I'ma let my nigga shine
And if you ain't my nigga, you a cloud to a nigga
Man I'll cop a key before a plea my brother
Break it down and sell it just to feed my brother
Guerrilla warfare, bitch, I feel like King Kong
Got the world in my hands like a screaming white woman
Dad, why the fuck did you leave my mother?
Rich as a motherfucker, me and my mother
Can't trust her, can't trust her
If she ain't my mother
Can't believe these hoes
Can't believe it's not butter
Can't believe these niggas
Can't believe they're 100
Can't believe the drugs 
Can't believe it's not cut
Can't believe it's real love
Can't believe it's not lust
Love is blind, love is blind
With his eyes wide shut
I ain't lyin'
You gon' get your bitch kidnapped
You don't answer the phone, you gon' get your bitch whacked
In exchange for yourself, you can get your bitch back
Love is blind, love is blind
'Cause my heart is pitch black
Think fast, blam back
Bullets fast, Amtrak
Get your shit ramshacked
Get my bitch man jacked
I'm too high to backtrack
It's too good to pass back
Shoutout to the weed man, never sold a bad pack
I'm just sticking to the code, I ain't tryna crack that
Actin' bad on these boys like a bitch with bad cramps
And somebody said ""hell"" and I caught a flashback
Of that one-man cell, then I had to snap back
Like ""fuck that shit my nigga you around all your niggas""
Around all your niggas
With a Nubian queen, skin brown as the liqueur
Brown as the liqueur
And the brand new machine coming down like a missile
Coming down like a missile
Brand new machine gun, brrrrr stick em'
Brrrr stick em'

Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my niggas
The money look so beautiful walking up the aisle to a nigga
Tryna figure how an empty background become a crowd full of niggas
And the bitch right next to me feel like she miles from a nigga
At least we all smile for the picture
Them niggas that's been there
Them niggas my niggas
I need 'em to bring me more rounds for my niggas
We up, I don't have to look down for my niggas
I paid dues, show the amounts to them niggas
She told me she'll only go down on her nigga
And then she looked up with a mouthful of niggas
Doubt that I'll ever be doubtful my nigga
My stamp on the game, send it out to them niggas
I wanna be like Lil Wayne when I grows up
Smile full of bling-bling when I blows up
I  what they did to the 
Fuck the man, now he owes us
Fuck the man
Couldn't pass, had to come up with another plan
Couldn't ball 'cause I couldn't dribble with my other hand
Fuck the man
No really girl, fuck the man
I'm the man
I don't give a fuck about another man

Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my niggas

Much More,The Dedication,2005.0,"There is no peace
I ride 'till is not wheels
Till there is no streets
Like where is my piece
They dying in them cells or already dead
Or tryna kill themselves
I rep my niggas, I love my city
I feel myself and she feel my wealth
So it will not help, I gotta get me
And money like pussy and I gotta get deep
So I gotta get street cause it's riding on me
My niggas can't drive, I got riders with me
And nah I ain't in to that back and forth chit chat
As a matter fact I'mma end that...
Prone to destruction, home is corrupting
Stones in my dungies won't do the justice
Them hundred dollar homes is in abundance
Hustle on a mountain, hustle in a tundra
Get that money or don't function
Punctuation exclamation exclamation period
That's the way I have to make it
S to K, you better take it, idiots period
Bull shit, I pity it
Them guns shot so loud you would think I MIDI'd it
I shot more than once, I'm ab-libing it
Oh well you been in hell so what, I live in it
I'm giving it all, I got for them incentives
Riding for them benefits and now it's back to 10 a brick

Cut off a nigga head make him suck his own dick

You had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in the corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love

For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare, the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had love

When you was just a young'un, your looks were so precious
But now your grown up, so fly it's like a blessing
But you can't have a man look at you for 5 seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself so when you got older
It's seems like you came back 10 times over
Now you're sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder

See you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love

Me dejaste en mil pedazos por no saber amar como amar?

Y tu tan inocente me tenias locamente enamorado, me tenias locamente enamorado
Y ya lo ves, lo que fue ya fue te marchaste poco a poco de mi lado y yo sigo locamente enamorado aqui sigo locamente enamorado
Te fuiste pero nunca me dijiste adios me dejaste en mil pedazos por no saber amar como amar?

You never retire out of what you do
Meaning, if you put so much into--if what you do is your life, like mine
You know what I mean like, my career is my life
So I could never retire out, even when I stop rapping
I'm going to still be in some kind way or form or fashion in it
You know what I mean like
When I die there's going to be rappers at my funeral, hopefully
You know what I mean
But, you know what I mean that's just how it is
Or, y'all gonna remember that that was a rapper
But hopefully, I'll go down known for something different--
Not different, but known for something else also, you know what I mean

Pussy MVP,The Drought is Over 2: The Carter 3 Sessions,2007.0,"You gonna love me, baby!
Fresh checkerboard Vans and a T-shirt
And it's going down but she first
My flow sweet, make my teeth hurt
I spit ice cream bars, that's dessert
To me there's no such thing as a G-1st
Yea, my feature price high like a mink purse
I smoke a whole reef of the reefer
Drugs are bad but I beg to defer, sir
I just take a look at her face
So she can see that
My shades are Versace and she purr
Cause I'm a cool cat per say
So I give her my life and now I got eight, word
She asked me to go over her place, I said sure
She said shes been horny all day, I got the cure
I'm on her like turf
Now bring that ass, bring that ass
Bring that ass hurr, ya digg?
I, I, I don't know that you been told
But I can tell you something 'bout me
I smoke weed, I drink and I roll

I've been trappin' on the low low
Just me and my woe no

Captain on my logo, that's me and my bro bros
Promethazine a no dose, a recipe for oh oh

Trapping out the 4-door, traffic moving so slow
I just come from cholo, cholo got that coco
My Iphone bout' to blow though
They looking for that coco
They know I got that coco
I'm never a no-show
I'm never with po-po
And it's always on the low-low
And it's always for the low-low
I look out for the poor folks
I'm sipped out I'm a slow 
I'm swagged out for the gold rope
I pull the cash out scream ""yolo""
Till I get a sore throat nigga whoa whoa
I tell my hoe no before my woe woe
Fuck her till she scream ""No more go slow""
I like when bitches scream ""Go go go though""
And ride me lika a  Volvo
I got keys in this  Volvo
And I'm keeping a low pro fo' sure
I done made it to the money and it feel like Christmas
I tell a hoe ""Ho ho ho""

Stop talkin' when you cuddle
Hoe this ain't no love boat
Smoking like a tug boat
I get in the  and I go for the gun store
I go for the gun store
I don't fuck with young hoes
My bitch swallow cum though and even blow a bubble
I just be like encore
This shit is a blood sport
We shoot you in your muscles
And leave you like a puzzle
AK-47 and the nina has a couple
Numbers don't lie I shoot you a hundred times
Long hair don't care
Bitch it's Weezy not Rapunzel
I'm on these trees bitch swinging in the jungle
And I was born there like Tarzan
I was dealt the hard hand
But now they call me Starzan
And I just pop the bar exam
Penitentiary flow my bars hard
Too hard for a cell mate
So all these other fucking rappers to me ain't nothing but a jail bait
Too much coke make the skill shake
Too much coke make the skill shake
It's Lil Tune aka Jim
That's what they call you when you sell weight
The feds watching with a stale face
The hoes watching with the Yeah face
We fuck all night make up on the pillow
Wake up in the morning see a real face
Ben Franklin with the blue face
Lil Wayne tattoo face
Bad bitch with a cute face
I fuck her and her room mate
The work just came today
I break the birds down to 
Then she let me hotter than a  I love you baby

And trapping on the low low

Realized,Lights Out,2000.0,"What?
What?!
Look-
Okay, let's cut the crap
I'm straight gangsta - forget the rap
I only stick with that cause my ma don't wan' see me flip the crack
And I'm quick to click and spit the gat
I be dipped in black
Sip the Coke mixed with Jack - Calico, clip to match
Like: where them cats who trippin' at? - Point niggas out
Cause right now I'm full of that spinach that'll knock Lennox out
The Mack-10 is out, as well as the gauge and the pump
You turn the page on the newspaper, see my face in the front
I lock it down for all my niggas that still caged in the dump
So if I come, nigga, just save me a blade and a pump
I'm raised in the slum where the bad grow
Unlike no other, I'm real gutta like bad bowls
I stash O's in the drawers of my trash hoes
I flash dough at the laws when they pass slow
I mash low in a stolen hot RAV-4
The Macks blow bullet holes for my cash flow
Is that so?

I don't think you realize what's happenin', dog
That lil' boy's 'bout to come 'round here blastin' at y'all
If you don't get the hell when he swervin' by
That's your issue - God bless ya - you deserve to die

Look
Which one of these niggas playin' with me?
I'mma strap up and slam his parent's street
When I blast, bullets spit faster than MC Hammer beats
I be damned if he get a chance to sleep
I clamp the magazine in my gun and cut his family tree
I flash the piece at your lil' woman and make her dance for me
Then jam the freak with a broom - blood leak from her panty crease
There has to be some explanation for this insanity
Yeah, y'all niggas faker than that boy (fill in the blank)
Now give me the dank
Niggas claim they want war when I suggest you live in a tank
What's your kid gonna think?
Come home and find your wig in the sink
I dig in the bank, and pull out eighty, then cruise to Haiti
For fifty G's I get ten ki's and straight out weight it
I lock my area down - you can ask these boys
They know Weezy got more white than the Backstreet Boys
Never catch me unattatched without them plastic toys
It get drastic, boy
Niggas that's askin' for it
Weezy, nigga
It's Weezy, nigga
Who? Weezy, nigga
It's Weezy, nigga

I don't think you realize what's happenin', dog
That lil' boy's 'bout to come 'round here blastin' at y'all
And if you don't get the hell when he swervin' by
That's your issue - God bless ya - you deserve to die

I hope y'all niggas understand that I ain't playin' or jokin'
Bust shots, make you think the Grand Canyon open
Leave a busta bandana smokin' from hot hollows
Me and my niggas flip your coke, then cop hot hoes
Two pistols, desperado gun busta
Pump one under your chest and knock a lung from ya
Hung under them killers and duck the pigs
And all of our diamonds shine, and our trucks are big
And, nigga, I don't really care if I don't sell a million quick
Cause right now I'll quit and go and sell a million bricks
I sticks to what I love, and that's the street
And stay away from what I hate, and that's police
And I keep a trigga somewhere on me to start blowin'
And leave a nigga somewhere lonely with his heart showin'
When we all knowin' that Weezy have never been fake
The metal will spray and let the bullets tear up your face
Who want this Weezy, nigga? Who want this Weezy, nigga?
Weezy, nigga; Lil Weezy, nigga

Say, I don't think you realize what's happenin', dog
That lil' boy's 'bout to come 'round here blastin' at y'all
Say, I don't think you realize what's happenin', dog

Look, I fucked the bitch with a broomstick
The same broom that I didn't clean my room with;
Yeah, I'm on her peach like a fruit fly
Last Night I bumped into God, I be Too High
Like ""Excuse you,"" I said, ""Who are you?""
He said ''I'm  the motherfuckin reason you are you''
Really? Wow, You're the reason?
And all these time I thought it was Bitch ass Dwayne and Cita
Ehh, My Niggas nutty as a fruit pie
Shoulda Woulda Coulda mama should have got her tubes tied
The only job my bitch ever had is a boob job
Commit to the bitch? I'd rather commit suicide
I once knew a guy who knew a guy who had some weed
He turned out to be fruity, tried to suck my johnny apple seed
I ripped his fuckin heart out
And gave it to my girl on valentines day
And she still fuckin broke it
You hoe' bitch I hate you
Matter of fact, I love every bitch that ain't you
I heard they kick you out of heaven for dyking with angels
Ughhhhh!, I said I'll never think about you again
And you gave me brain, You're playing mind games
I tattoo these tears cos you a crying shame
I know you fuck niggas who on my team like Mama James
I fucked you raw and now a Nigga pissing fire rain
And now my dick mad at me, fuck!

I ain't crazy, these hoes crazy
Crazy as a Road Lizards

Man, Have you ever seen a road lizard?
As soon as the get stuck in the middle of a road
Like, Cars keep passing
Like, It don't know where to go, because everywhere It go
Its like a tyre to the left, a tyre to the right
Its like its going crazy, Road lizards!

Ughh
Iguana Vagina, Reptile
And that Sissy ass Kid ain't my step child
Should slit your motherfuckin' throat and make your neck smile
T. gave me Insomnia and made me calm down
And when my high came down, I burned the home down
I ain't on cloud nine, i'm on my own cloud
My friends are white, I might be hanging with the wrong crowd
Get it? Hangin'?
I'm titty-banging a bitch who still wear a training bras
I ate her fuckin heart out, it came with fries
And my soft drink, I don't blink, I see it all
My dick a ballerina, let me stick it in your Leotard
How the fuck these bitches gonna call me a dog?
Hold my dick above your head like a MVP award
Ahh, I head you're back fucking your old Nigga
I get into my car and run-over the motherfuckin..

I Like It,The Drought is Over 4,2007.0,"I sit here alone everyday
Everyday at my window, my living room window
Thinkin' 'bout you
I watch the kids as they play
What happened to Nintendo? Where did it go?
No time for video games, no time for SEGA
Oh no, but I'm in space
I don't know if it is this girl face
Or how she taste, but I like it
 (x2)
(Good God)
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know what I got myself into

But I like it, ooh I like it
When you doin' it, how I like it
So keep doin' it, how I like it
Cause I like it, ooh I like it

I like sex in the mornin', I like sex at night
I like sex on the weekends, is that alright?
Alright, alright, all night, alright?
Come on, I got shampoo chilled
Took off her dress but kept on the heels
Damn baby, you so exotic
Holler my name loud when I'm inside it
No shame, I ate her pride
Tickled the pearl tongue and came up smilin'
Two dips a dip, and now we ridin'
Bed to the sink, sink to the shower
Back to the sink, back to the bed
It's 3:45, now I'm gettin' some head

I get cold, I get goosebumps
And I head out the door, that's similar to her name
I'm so cold, but with her, all alone
I'm so high, I'm nearly hittin' the flame
She told me her name is Crazy
And I said ""Hi, they call me Insane""
Crazy and Insane is so high up in the tree

I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know what I will do
I guess I, I guess I, would just die
Go to Heaven and wait on you

Ooh, I think I like you
If you was a poem, I would recite you
The bed could be our ring, I wanna fight you
Put my key in your ignition, let me ignite you
The cops keep comin', the cops keep comin'
To my front door like I'm trynna do somethin'
They don't understand that I'm involved with a woman
That love to make noise when she feel it in her stomach
I'mma have to talk to the neighbors
Matter of fact, let me take a walk by the neighbors
I don't know what the hell wrong with the neighbors
And what they expect when an animal is matin'
Knock on the door, like chicky-chicky-check it
Life is a party, don't ricky-ricky-wreck it
Y'all will call the cops and report a domestic
When I'm just trynna kill a problem called erection
Head in the coupe, call it sex on wheels
I'm a big dude, I treat sex like meals
She ride me for breakfast, I'm on top for lunch
And behind her for dinner, for dessert she say ""yum""

I sit here alone everyday
Everyday, everyday in living room window
I watch the kids as they play
What happened to Nintendo?
No time for video games, no sir
No time, no time for SEGA
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know what I got myself into
But I like her, I like her, I like her
And if she leave, I don't know what I'll do
I do know, I'd go to Heaven
And darlin' I'mma wait on you

Come on, come on, come on, come on
Ain't nothin' nice or sweet (Huh?)

Look-
Now when I crawl up out the Rove' I got quarters and O's
Forty-fours under my clothes, I'm drunk and blowed
And I done told them boys if they play I dump their mothers
Now they findin' niggas everyday slumped in gutters
I come through on the block strapped, bumpin' Bubba
For the summer in a bright orange pumpkin Hummer
Stumblin' from the Courvoisier, and lots of hay
And make me run in your place and take your pops away
See, they got niggas in my hood who can't cop the yay
So I can get it understood and have you chopped today
And not to say I could even hit your block and spray
And try to knock all the bone structure out your face
Stick a potato on the head of my nine, it's deadly quiet
Leave a nigga redder than swine, you damn pig
The plan is to take everything and kill 'em all
Young or old, nigga, big or small
Ain't nothin' nice

Ain't nothin' nice around here, stupid
Keep playin', you won't see next year, stupid
And in the van there's a box in the back full of plenty of tools
And when you see me on the block, I come to give 'em the blues

Look-
Now we all do dumb things
Playin' with Wayne doesn't have to be one of 'em
I'll murder his father right in front of him
None of 'em are ready for the trouble I'm 'bout
Pull up in a bubble, hop out, then let a couple pop out
I got two double Desert Eagles, bustin' at your peoples
Cussin' at polices, and roughin' up your nieces
See me just off the meters
Don't leave without the heaters
Believe this, my nina's got more shelves than Adidas
You see the slick jackin', believe it's Glocks and millimeters
Run up on your family and pop your senioritas
A lot of Hennessy, just twist that lil' baby
Damn, them hollow tips just missed that lil' baby
This is definitely, step to me, get a hysterectomy
Technically I'll murder anyone who disrespectin' me
Seventeen Carollton, mess with me, I bury one
Three-eighty, I carry one
Come to kill up everyone
What!

Ain't nothin' nice around here, stupid
Keep playin', you won't see next year, stupid
And in the van there's a box in the back full of plenty of tools
And when you see me on the block, I come to give 'em the blues

Everybody freeze and drop when Lil Weezy cock
And niggas be like Q-Tip cause they breathe and stop
Believe or not, the ki's ten G's a wat
Until I die apple and Eagle that be's the block
And he's so hot that four hundred degrees the spot
And weed and vodk' got me wanna beat a cop
I grease the Glock, the scope with the beam and dot
And I'm hangin' out the Beamer top releasin' shots
Follow me, everybody in the family die sourly
Niggas drop hourly ruinin' your economy
Liquor power me, now there's nothin' that can bother me
Creep up in your window while you're sleepin', take your child with me
I'm wild, and Wheezy more violent than Dennis Rodman
Slide up in a blue truck and shoot-up a whole lot of men
A lot of heat, a lot of fire, a blazer like Stoudamire
Ride around your neighborhood and you wake up with bodies by your house

Ain't nothin' nice around here, stupid
Keep playin', you won't see next year, stupid
And in the van there's a box in the back full of plenty of tools

I'm a thunderstorm I wet shirts
Plus I'm right up in the Gulf so it can worse
Put my white up in her bra, and my burner in her purse
She get right past the law, shit we might smash tomorrow
And if there's nice cash involved I'm right there with y'all

Captian hard I got that hard white
Shit look marble under certain light
Who that IS?...
Weezy F. Baby ho word it right
Homie spit cool bars like Klondike
My 9 right here....I ain't lyin
He can stop the track and let me shoot one time if you don't believe me
I'm so nasty how I did them Carmelo Anthony's with the jewelry to match it...
Look like a mural on my chest
Two or three chains I plural the best
Yes...and fresh is how I'm dressed
Floss on a rack, Lacoste on my set
The easy pair of Pradas, the mean three quarters
You know the ankle lengths, no socks wit them...
Aye Stunna, them niggas better pack up
Tell em that your son be out front with backup
Bitch back up

{Verse 2}
And I am, feeling like a million dollars
No, really like a billion dollars
Curt Schilling how I pitch the powder, in a mist of riders
Still sending kites to lifers
I feel like my ice the brightest
Why I feel like my Nikes the whitest?
Young nigga tuned up like Midas
I'm ill like hepatitis, we appeal when they extradite us
Take death to fighters
And even that won't bite us nigga that don't move us
Our backs is glued up we too stuck
And you ask why my bitch stuck up?
Blood, she got crack up her butt
I back up the truck like Sonny in Bronx Tale
Or Gotti in Southside, highly intoxide, That high
Ridin on the Wildside, our side
Tell the law that I'm in a 300 Thou ride
Fuck around and my seats be cow-hide
I'm so country, my flow husky
Repo Man, faget you owe something
He must not know the repocussions
We so struggling like we po'
Cause ain't enough dough to get us equal with the white people

No pocket knife, no pocket iron
Pots and pans make the pockets wider
Dig em a hole, let the property hide em
Build a house and throw a party over your dead body
Never said I'll never fail, but never dropped an assignment
Gotta finish what you start or the cops'll find it
Dinner in the park, yeah may seem cool
But me,I'd rather not let them see my food

Lookin at the ceilings like I'm a get it for realer
I'm a get it regardless, hard as it is
Who wants to be a millionaire, know how I'm a get a million
(A million?) and I'm in a pavilion
Chillin' with my woman but I don't speak Sicilian
(Sicilian?) But we both count the same
As long as when I send'em with it they come out the same
As if I went up in with it then I'm out the game
Them niggas tryna get me canned, damn
You know the feds are my biggest fans
Gotta watch what a nigga sayin' damn
They see my mommy & they wanna pull over
Cause she ain't got no number on the back of the Rover
Like she ain't got no business in Colorado
Just enjoying the snow, she was hittin' the slopes
She from the South, she ain't never skied before
And I heard she didn't fall go Cita go
And I'm just like her, I'm an easy pro
I am a gladiator call me Hustle Crow
Touch'em no, I'm just bustin', bust some mo
What's the 411 1 ya done
Once the pro rush come run ya gone
Youngsta know how to punch the gas
In an 84' with the cut-back ass
On 84's with the custom rag
Top drop at the second line & bust they ass
Got me lookin' like Hot Spitta (Yeaaa)
I'm a big spender, therefore I stunt
You niggas city slickers, we call it country dumb
A Southern boy, all I do is bake cake
And guess where ya bitch comin' after spring break
Blessed with the gift so I gotta bring faith
A less nigga tell more love than hate
One of the best to do it
Yes kid you are young MJ I'm checkin' Du mar
I give it to y'all the only way I know
And that is too raw, like no cut on coke
Ay, baby girl sit on this butter soft & take a tote
Don't choke, it ain't attractive, just smoke
And when I'm done you ain't a factor just go
And here I come so get it faster, land hoe!
Man nobody's gonna help you out
So you gotta help ya self, if you can't, kill ya self
Yup, that's how I feel & how I felt
That's how the hand was dealt no handing help
No handing outs just me & that abandoned house
With the hammers out, I remember
I had lil Tootie watchin' out
No lie we was high off our own supply
Teenagers with that cocaine eye
But we quit cause we learned that's how Tony died
It is only I, the son of a God
The Birdman baby that fuckin' guy
I love that fuckin guy
Now I'm the Birdman Jr so fuckin' fly
Hold up, I'm just tryin' to kick it with my nigga Boo
(I'm ridin' with you) yeeeaah

With the exotic Coupe with the divided roof
We on Mel Rose we like models too
Like how ya do? You eat fruit?
Me too! Isn't that a shocker
I live in the skyscrapers hi helicopter!
And that chain is very aqua
And sir that watch is very vodka
I'm lookin' like a watermelon mamba
Like Canneries fly down by them
So I got it, wrapped like a condom
Protecting my self from the drama
No more baby mamas, shout out to my only baby mama
Our daughters growin' up real fast we gotta watch her
Daddy now is gettin' real cash
The deal was proper, the saga continues

You treat it like a blemish
Stop trying to be pretty, if you don't know anything baby

Just know I love you, just know I love you baby
And if it don't work out for some reason
""I tried"" is an understatement
But just know I love you, you know I love you baby
If it don't work out for some reason
It's probably your fault 'cause you always tripping and I'm always listening

We always bickering, Lord knows I'm sick of it
I can't continue this, I just want happiness
You just want benefits
How can I benefit from this whole situation when I'm limitless
When it comes to my feelings and my willingness
To blame your ignorance on an experience
Still take you serious, I'm such an idiot
I'm fucking risking it fucking with you girl, fucking with you girl
Should've know you was just something to do when there's nothing to do girl
Now you talking this shit 'bout my new girl, acting like a lil girl
You are now no longer in Wayne's world, welcome to the real world
I'ma just move on, you should just move on
It ain't about who right or who wrong
It's about living the type of life you want
No need for us to go back, there's no moon walking in this bitch
I tried too hard to make this shit work but it's too gone
So let's just be friends and bury the hatchet and read what it say on the tombstone
It says...

Just know I love you, just know I love you baby
And if it don't work out for some reason
""I tried"" is an understatement
But just know I love you, you know I love you baby
If it don't work out for some reason
It's probably your fault 'cause you always tripping and I'm always...
Just know I love you, just know I love you baby
And if it don't work out for some reason
""I tried"" is an understatement
But just know I love you, you know I love you baby
And if it don't work out for some reason
It's probably your fault 'cause you always tripping and I'm always...
Just know I love you, just know I love you baby
Just know I love you, just know I love you baby
Just know I love you, just know I love you baby
And if it don't work out for some reason
It's probably your fault 'cause you always tripping...
And I'm always listening

Dear, I fear we're facing a problem
You love me no longer, I know and
Maybe there is nothing that I can do
To make you do
Mama tells me...",https://genius.com/Lil-wayne-understatement-lyrics

Gangsta music, you know how the gangsters do it
Bangers, exlcusive
Shankers and uzis
I got Maine in the booth
Wayne in the booth
Money on my mind, that mean I'm thinking of loot

Shit, ain't it the truth
Money is the top prio-
""Money Over Murder,"" that's the title of my bio
We cop drops like it's part of the policy
This hardbody, baby, y'all softer than wallabies
So hush puppies, let the big dogs ride
Don't jump on that field when it's kickoff time

And I, fresher than the Frebreeze bottle
Coming at the shit full throttle
And I power ball like lotto
Do it with my eyes closed
You niggas is all soft, soft shell tacos

And eyes go deeper than pot holes
For that money, bet I'm running like a snot nose
No Kleenex
Dark shades, V-necks
Bitch, I ain't playing no recess
We reps YM, baby, that's that shit
And it's fuck the world like a nasty bitch

Fuck raps, I bust caps for snaps
I fuck white, I fuck blacks, I fuck Japs
Now what's hap?
I make stacks, ASAP
I take that from the safe and I replace that

Stay strapped
I stay low, stay back
The judge handing out L's like Pat Sajak
And I'm all about my team like an apex
Make you niggas turn your seats into a Playtex

Yes, member of a fly society
Style, I got several varieties
As a child, this guy memorized ""Scarface"" in it's entirety
The 80s drug era inspired me
That's why I dress how I dress, walk how I walk
That's why I rep what I rep, talk how I talk
Two rope chains, both of them gold
With a gloat like I just came home

Flow touching the pedal in that F-5 yellow
Just moving through the city like blood in the vessel
I'm a fucking professional, so intellectual
It's Mr. Fat Stacks, my pockets got high cholesterol
I need vegetables, is weed vegetables?
I'm past commas, right now I'm seeing decimals

Step to you, the opposite of my environment
Out of all the dogs in the yard, I was the quietest
I had a little bark, I had a little bite
Was surrounded by niggas who snap and don't think twice
To kidnap your enemies, dress them up as Santa Claus and drop their bodies down their mamas' chimneys
Water to your kidneys
My class G like the Bendz G

My truck waving and my rims speak
I got burners on my rear seat
See, I don't say too much, so if talking becomes part of the ballgame, money talk for me, yeah, my ends speak
Yeah, what you expect? I'm from the Hollygrove area
Where we see more redskins than Steve Spurrier
We know the clock ticking, so we planning hurry up offense
Hustling on the park bench, caution

The major bison of the boulevard
The barracuda, fighting off the fish and raw
Yeah, I get around like a business car
And you can see me everywhere but the prison yard
I'm on that sissy hard, and that kush tough
Weezy stay high, just look up

Shook up like a can of Coca-Cola that fell down five flights of stairs, man
Can't hide that you niggas so scared, man

Pain, since I've lost you I'm lost too
Nigga feelin like he at the bottom like a horse shoe
Sorry for the trouble that I put you and your heart through
God knows that I'll do anythin for a part two, art too
Be friends with her, then you come back to me sayin that you forgive me
Gimme another chance I'm needin it like a kidney
I don't wanna advance, give me back her hands
Give me back her touch, I don't ask for much
But I fucked, I know I fucked up
I admit I fucked up, but everybody fuck up
Now this another nigga locked up
Tell him me and my clique don't give a fuck
Cause I be from New Orleans, she was from Georgia
She was my down chick, I was her soldier
I was her gansta, she was my shoulder
You were the pistol to my holster, BANG

You've been brave, never lettin it show
Always tryin to keep it under control (I see you hidin it mama)
You got it now, and weather your way to the top (you doin your thang)
But there's somethin that you forgot

You forgot about the house, you forgot about the ring
I remember everythin, I just wanna hear you sing
I remember the love right after the fight
You can't tell me you don't remember those nights
And if I would cry, then you would cry twice
To me you are the brightest star and the sunlight
See take away my title, take away my stripes
You give back my girl then you give me back my life
Give back my girl then you give me back my life
See this is just a nightmare so I blink twice
Open up my eyes hopin she be in my sight
I remember the time I wish I could bring it back
What she mean to me is what I mean to rap

You've been brave, never lettin it show
Always tryin to keep it under control
You got it now, and weather your way to the top

You know, I see you hidin it mama
But I know you know
I know you do
But I wish you and yours nothin but happiness shorty

But I hope you haven't forgot about me up in the livin room watchin Sportscenter
You were cookin dinner, I was such a sinner
But the Lord is a forgiver, you know they say if you pray
Then you can get your blessings harder than delivered
And your boyfriend is not like me
Ma you even went and got a tan drop like me
I remember we was in that home all day
You called me ""Butter"" I called you ""Bay""
My mama asked about ya, my partners did too
I know your daughter will be so amazin like you
And I know you probably wish you never met me
And I just wish you never forget me
And let me say please don't worry about the women I've been with
No engagement can amount to your friendship
And I hope that nigga know he got a queen
And all I can do is dream, DAMN

I've been woundin, I've been waitin for you

Dec. 4 (Freestyle),The Prefix,2004,"The people asking me ''Wayne, what's crackalacking''? I can't kid
I ain't smelling out my ass, mama, I ain't shit
But you can't tell my mama that I ain't the shit
And if you talk about my mama bet I'm all in your shit
All of the things go to my mama cause she brought me in this
And ever since I never miss her, never called in sick
I go to work, I don't quit, mama taught me this
''You go berserk for that crib, baby boy, don't slip''
I'll murk you for them chips and make Frito Lay
I'm trying to come up on the fortress, split it 3-4-ways
Hey - Mama say ''don't let 'em see your page''
Don't let 'em copy you off your paper, let 'em see yo' ok
And you ain't gotta do nothing but be your age
But mama how can I? I will be so paid
She kept me with money, I keep her with money, she like
""Long as you investin' in something,"" I'm invested in her
I got my weight up

Pops passed, I had to get off my ass
Had to put it in little bags and get off my grass
Nigga coming at me sharp my ass
I'm just trying to play my part like Cass', smart like Taz
I used to carry off-white like cash
Now I tote handguns like bags
Ain't too much changed
Still pitch and give 'em a split or a change up
I never up and change, I just get my change up
I'm greasy with the game, Joe Casey gave me, I'm an animal
And niggas hate me like rabies
But niggas taste this and lick nuts like ladies
I get ape quick and hit up like I get
I deflate the game and insert my dick
That mean I fuck the game so fuck the game
I grind to the money, say fuck the game
Man, niggas wonder why I got out, I won the game
I'm a champion

And when I got paid I gave back what I owed
So don't be mad when you see me in the Maybach or the Rolls
Making haters taste crack when I'm attacking the roads
Sitting so far back with the seat I'm in the trunk with the coke
You know what's under the seat, I got the Combat 4
Gave a nigga one, bet he don't come back no more
Nope - it's Weezy F and the 'F' is for flow
I spit blood on a track, call me Dracula dough
I get it sacking, act like I came back from coke
Not guilty or Jesus, let rabbit go
Wow, that's my daddy if ya'll ain't know
And I love him with every second my hard day go
Buck - remember when the bullet caught lil' bro?
Who you think got that blood up off that flo'?
Who you think made that boy come off so cold?
How you think that young boy come off so old?

Three phones and my pagers go berzerk

I'm talkin' work, enough to make you a clerk
Rubber bands, hard plates (what else?) big spoons
That whip got the plug out in mid June
Early July, I'm early like the bird that fly
Even Martin got a piece of that pie
I Eddie Murphy laugh at nigga, throw that piece in the sky
Drop the top on the Mercy, and bench streets with my tires
Make it dance like Percy, kids they on the sidewalk
Used to stash weed in my momma's Buick Skylark
I talk only full prices, negotiation
Rumination, fuck the police station
And if you got any association, then murder all close relation

Grocery bags on the counter, no grocery store
Couldn't fit a half a mil in the Gucci tote
Hit the lights, watch the roaches say ""good night""
Stomp twice, say goodbye to the mice
Cook nice with a little bit of slice
And watch them dope fiends put that fire to that ice
Surely that dog's tail wag, it will bite
Man I'm just trynna get my scratch on these lice
When I was young, I had a flag on my bike
And then I went and got them mags on my bike
Momma don't wait up for me, I lost a bundle runnin' from the cops

I say I gotta get Nae-Nae lunch money
I say I gotta get Nae-Nae lunch money
It's Hollygrove till they bury me cold
Who's to say if they gon' bury me old?
I live that street life

Back to the struggle, born trouble
Like trynna find strength in a torn muscle
Young as scum, Daddy gone
But youngin' run the streets till he pull the gun
Pull they arm, all-all black hoodie on
Talibon strapped with the gat like a bomb
Red storm, handkerchief head on
Fuck around and them bees swarm, be calm
Better know what street you on
Don't you come on Eagle, are you Evel Knievel?
Crackheads got pipes and pistols
Now run up on that crackhead and fight the pistol
This is the street, nigga eat
Where the birds don't tweet, the birds go cheap
And niggas don't sleep, you may have heard of MLK

Murder capital, bitch it's time for some action
Niggas want peace, but we give them ho's a fraction
-Of the murder rate, Don't be a part of the percentage
Now break me off my penny, you piggy

(Yeah, i'm so good)
If I ain't gettin' dough, then I'm probably dead baby
The grass gotta grow, the bears gotta be fed
Don't come near the cage, if you ain't got no bread
We ain't nothing but a gang, and i'm the honcho head
I ain't never had nothing, but some money to turn to
Some bitches to toss up, some weed to burn through
If this real shit, then this don't concern you
The days of my life, i'm just free to journal
Thumbing through the pages, i'm tryin' to learn you
It's hot down south, keep your heat in the thermal
It might be a surprising cuz the shit ain't normal
Man the shit just terrible, but the shit ain't changing
Look how one band  make the changes
The city wiped out, now the city famous
But Lil Wayne is the city's angel
Guess who's remaining after all that drainage

Gangsta shit, get your game up, boy, for real

The clock is ticking, the cops is sitting
Waiting on me to pop the ribbon so I can get locked in prison
But I forgive 'em, they don't know I got the bishop
Giving me a future face, they cannot prevent it
Sky's the limit, I travel but I tries to pivot
Look in my eyes and combine the spirit, time'll end it
If it's not a couple of Gs, it's dimes and pennies
If I don't break a knuckle or knee, my shine is finished
I'm climbing in it, but I could fall down the chimney
A hound is in me, so don't come around or near me
You clowns is really fucking up, ya bound to get it
I sit a barrel on ya tongue so round and pretty
Fought my ticket, now I'ma skip town and kick it
Dress code: just some khaki brown lil' Dickies
Got them pounds and chickens stuffed in coffee grounds and fishes, nigga

He's probably with Rodney, or probably with Roney
I go by Trill Rill cause he be up in the morning
See, that's that penitentiary shit and he been out for a minute
But I'm up!
Birdman keep asking me to stick
22s on the Rolls and I keep telling him no, but
If he keep playing then I'ma have to show him
And come through this bitch on 24s
Like what up?!
These hoes keep asking me to marry 'em
Knowing that my ex-wife'll bury 'em
So bitch, shut up!
I'm blowing on that berry like Marion
You knowing what the fuck a nigga carrying
Get bald head like a Aryan
I think a nigga bout to buy a Marriott
Now all my hoes, put up!

Move light, walk, step, talk, squeak, holla (I hear 'em)
Pull a tool, nigga sweet like peach cobbler
Shoot twice, don't check, let them people find him
I'm the screw face to this rap game
Weezy put me on, new face with the same name

Oh yes I did, get 'em, kid, if I ask ya
Just bring me the bastard with his head unfastened
Faster than a panther goes the lead from the clapper
Round up ya boys, get this round of applause

They say I'm two faced, look, nigga, I ain't changed
Cause if I feel played, I'ma let the iron rain
Rrrang, bang bang with my gang, mane
Know how to slang 'caine, whoa, I can maintain

Bang bang, cross my chest
Bang bang, you cross ya chest
Toss ya chest in the mess with the rest, damn

And she looks a whole lot better and more
Looking a choice just waiting to be chose
I chose her and (It's been a week) but, um...
It feels like I know the girl so well
I don't know how but (It's been a week) and, um...
It's like we do whatever we shall like good pals
But um... (It's been a week) True!
But it's like I know her when I hold her, you know?
(It's been a week) But I, but I still told her how I told her
When I told her what I told her

It's been a week, but, oh, it seems like a year (It's alright)
It's been a week, but, oh, it seems like a year (It's alright)
It's been a week, but, oh, it seems like a year (It's alright)
It's been a week, but, oh, it seems like a year (It's alright)

Could it be love at first sight? First fuck, first fight
And it's only been a week but it feels like
A year, like, two months or something like that
I'm lost in the calendar but she know where I'm at
It's been a week man, but, um...
You dont know but I bet you know where she at
'Cause, it's been a week, but, um...
She's in that Carter with Nino in her back, yes
Damn, it's been a week, but, um...
It's like two trains that were on the same track, haha
It's been a week and, uh...
She changed her name to ""I'ma call you right back""
Damn, and I say...

It's been a week, but, oh, it seems like a year (It's alright)
It's been a week, but, oh, it seems like a year (It's alright)
It's been a week, but, oh, it seems like a year (It's alright)
It's been a week, but, oh, it seems like a year (Flip it)

I saw a girl at my show, in the front row
Standing there looking like she waiting to be told
I told her that and a whole lot more
And now she standing there looking like she waiting to be chose
And she say (It's been a week)
And I say, ""Yeah,"" say no
(It's been a week) And I say, ""Please, say no""
And I say, and she say, and we say

It's been a week, but, oh, it seems like a year (It's alright)
It's been a week, but, oh, it seems like a year (It's alright)

Secretary,Lil Weezy Ana,2006.0,"She is so sick, and I would love to be her patient
And I will work every day as long as she's my occupation
Be, be, don't you wanna be
Be my secretary, she's my secretary
He's just secondary, we do what we wanna
He don't have the slightest
He thinks she's the nicest
I think she's so nasty
We do it so often
It seems like a job now
Like a nine to five now

Don't you wanna be (don't you wanna be)
Be my secretary (be my secretary)
Come and work for me (come and work for me)
Whatever's necessary (whatever's necessary)

She's my employee of the month
Because of her I never learned how to role a blunt
She do everything for me, roll magazine for me
Shawty act like she gotta run away from him for me
Wayne, lemme quit talkin' and watch where I'm walkin'
I don't wanna step on toes, 'cause her homey gettin' angry
Overtime at the job is keepin' his girl from home
Nine to five or regular hours, but her shift's six to ten
She goes home at ten to be happy with her man
Till I need her too clock back in

You can check her resume and see what you will find
She has never missed a day and she has always been on time
When he's not in, that's when she clocks in
And if the bible says it's wrong, God don't forgive us for our sins

No lie,Wasted Bars,UnKnown,"Y, colorful like Chapel paint
You hapless fakes should know I'm the master bate
After dates: my place, innate to take out wrappers straight rappin' great
Keep spitin' till my lips bleed
Bury you 6 feet, got your girl fist deep
Your shit's weak, Ripley says mines risky
I take the stick out her mouth, just to let my chick breath
This'll make you spend your rainy day savings
I radiate rabis and I'd maybe date Brady's wife
She's a Brazilian baby from the 80's
Maybe be my lady, spit crazy and amazing
Lately, I been blazing cause I'm sicker than the chicken pox
Hit you with a Sunny Liston shot when the whistle stops
You write simple plots, mine are outlandish
I got a gifted cock, girls say its outstanding, yes-
I'm moving forwards while you stay stuck in sleet
I got a bunch of needs, S.May cut the beat
I'll run this game even if you cuff my feet
Fans love the heat so viewers be like ""fuck a beat""
I'm just a beast who will punch a G till his stomach bleeds
Gut check, tough set when your something's weak
Since puberty, weed has been a cash crop
Mad hops on the black top you work the snack shop
The definition of sloppy, ask Webster
Pay attention you copies, I roll the best herb
My brain is lifted, your plagiarism not fresher
Than me throwing 1 down as a catcher
Worship the wordsmith you're worthless and nervous
Surfing the surface with a surplus of servants
Look- I require your undivided attention
Around me don't mention, affection or prevention
Rapin' beats raw dog, like the cats in straw dogs
Hard bars, spit flame like Charzard
I smoke Ivysoar till my eyes are sore, buy some more
Smo
Fuck the rental house, I'm coming through to buy the whole block
No need your temper down, you know we 'bout to party non-stop
You try to rap but you chop, callin' fouls but you flop
If this is Famersville you're the pussy beggin' for crops
You a bottom feeder, Spongebob is your next door neighbor
Easy haters, save it for later, I'm your father Darth Vader
That's a joke invader Zim, I already run the world
No need to say it again, no need to say it again
You see I spit rhymes and dish dimes like my name's Steve Nash
You see I clip mine from the beanstalk, I don't spend no cash
I just watch that ass, as your bitch is cooking breakfast
I'm sexting her best friend, telling' me ""wear no protection""
She molested my mind, went on the Maury show to prove it ain't mine
Smokin' blunts all the time, or maybe spliff bowls or papers
Bow to your creator, no time for the bullshit
I'm out I'll see you later, I'm the man like Slater
Getting' pussy and your mascot is the masterbaters
You mad cause I stained her, you a little bitch so you stayed there
I'm the dog trainer, better yet call me the Whisperer
She's suckin' on my dick, and I ain't kiss her
I'm a baller, stackin' money like Griffin off the Clippers
Your a weird mother fucker lookin' for dragons and wizards
Fag well we figured, no need to stop at the bank
I get my money delivered in the same truck as my dank",https://genius.com/Lil-wayne-no-lie-lyrics

Hold up, you now under the deep cover of the lil' slugger
Callin' me head busta
Run with me K - blucka
Niggas done fled from-a...
...me infrared, sucka
If him wan' play, busta,...
...come make me dead, busta
Beanie'-a half-way out my nappy head
But I don't care - I just grab my clip, slap and spray
Anywhere - it don't matter where a nigga stay
Just believe me when I say, 
""Guerrilla warfare""
I swear, it be some more drama about these bags
Niggas in black drive Jags - camouflage rags
Niggas' domes get bust wide open with blood and sweat
Niggas ridin' off in Hummers - laughin', drinkin' Moette
You know me: Corlleon, standin' four feet
I'm to-tin' cannons, wearin' Rolies
See, these lil' boys, they ain't really up on my game
But once I run into that nigga playin' with Wayne, man
See, when I spin-a you bend then I be on you block
But when me jump out with the chop-chop, my nogga, you drop
Now where your niggas at, comradie? They not with you now
I guess they heard that when I'm ridin' I make the crew stop
Now, is you 'bout what I'm 'bout?
If you 'bout what I'm 'bout, you 'bout drama
Thuggin' in broad day with four Glocks, a knife, and a chopper
I'm runnin' away, don't get in my way

Callin' me head busta!
Caller callin' me killer!

Them lookin'-a down the street, them think they see Wayne truck
Him whole block don't scare me cause me get me thing and bust
Them know that Hot Boys known to be dangerous
Now U.P.T. come down - chopper city in the ghetto, my man
Now who that be in the car with the chopper? Oh, it's Lil' Wayne
I get my K - cock, aim, and put holes in your brain
Give me that rag, you ain't no soldier - wipe the blood off my chain
Gettin' blisty...
...off in a black F-150
'Bout to do the old usual - hit your block, just spittin'
Heads spinnin' like a set of seventeens or somethin'
Respect me for who I be: seventeen, head-bustin'
Because-them

Check!
Original Hot Boy - land-cruisin' with guns
I shall be the one who burn the block up
Never miss when I distribute anger up out my Cali'
Hundred shots automatic
Leave ya hopeless in the alley
Now, when a nigga runs up
If the nigga love his life he would have his guns up
Just because of the simple fact that I'm a Hot Boy,...
...and got boys that got toys to stop noise
See, when me ride off in the Hummer, leave him set empty
Now him catch three cause him want beef
Now, me tried to tell the stupid boy, ""Don't mess-a with me.""
Now look at him - open up his casket and see
Click-clack my mack, twist my Philly cap to the back
Jump in the black and scream ""war"", and just ""pow! pow!""
How you love me now?  With five barrels to your eye
The scene gets wild, and everybody gon' die
What the dillio? Fill a four-four clip
You'll get flipped for runnin' off at the lip
Who behind the gun flame?...

...and twistin'?
It's Mis-ter Wayne
Come splittin' when I spit

Whole club and they rocking

I'll leave his heart beating at his own feet
Take his car keys, ride around til it's on E
My homies all know that it's on me
And if it's on me we gon' eat like we never ate
Have a second plate, nigga gotta eat everyday
Feeding heavyweights
Nigga trying to see better days, lord knows
Ain't no such thing as second place
No such thing as yesterday, ain't no such thing as tomorrow
And promises is for hoes, and diamonds is all gold
If you fucking with my squad though, it be clean up, aisle 4
That's just how it go, niggas slipping like Dial soap
Either I'm too high or the clouds low
And I go Michael Myers, psycho lion, hyperwire, mic on fire
Bad bitch, tight attire, treat me like I'm siar, like a giant
Play below the belt and I'm Orion
My oh my, my flights is higher, price is higher
Life inspired by the riots, I'm a rider, can't deny it
Can't describe it, can't disguise it, advertise it

I'm smoking on the good kush, sipping on the codeine
Spitting all this fire, living off the proceeds
My bitch got that good juice
My plug got them low fees
I'm laughing to the bank though
'Cause these lil niggas joking

You ain't gang, gang, gang
You ain't squad, squad, squad
You ain't gang, gang, gang
You ain't squad, squad, squad, no

Gang, gang, gang, gang, gang
Gang, gang, gang, gang, gang
Squad, squad, squad, squad, squad, squad, squad up
Tied up, job done, woah

Smoking on the good kush, sipping on the codeine
Spitting all this fire, living off the proceeds
Tipping on 44, pimping all your hoes
We gon' do  it bigger than she ever did with your ass
Sleeping on Polo, I don't got no doors
Can't forget she in love with the coco
Hustling on the low-low, duffle bag, YOLO
And I'ma laugh to the fucking bank, bitch no joke

You ain't gang, gang, gang

Moment of clarity, yeah that's my diamond game
I keep a fine bitch, 'cause I like the finer things
He-haha! ...Fuck with me slime
No brain on the whip, I've got nothin in mind, haha

Pull out the garage in a Lotus
No it ain't the newest model out but it's hard to notice
I got more ice than a super-sized drink
And I know I'm the shit, I don't care what you think

Shine for Life,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Catch me I'm stumbling but no I'm never slipping
I come up out that water with nothing dripping, who fucking with him
I'm the guy they call the Carter the slaughter house
I go hard don't try cause I ride like the Marlins
Come buy I supply you with quarters
And bricks if your money that thick
I ain't running I'm running this bitch, sun on my wrist
I rock that, That rose ? parkay with the crock strap (Damn)
I stroll every single day with the Glock strap (Blam)
I'm spittin like Pac back (Wham)
I got that Bentley GT same color as rock crack
Interior stock black, but don't get popped at
I watched half my neighborhood get kept back
The other half sleeping where its best at
Minor set backs, this is grown man talk minor get back
I just had to stress that, talk to 'em B

You better know about the game of life
Cause When you hustle you can shine for life
You better know it could happen tonight
When your hood rich living the life
You got the money that could change the frame
And have a bitch just loving your game
You Got a Benz and a brand new Range
With 26's all over them thangs

Hey, I made a few adjustments, but for better justice
I get that cheddar fuck em.. maybe motherfuck 'em
I'm handing nothing to 'em but a plate of murder
It ain't beef if you can't make a burger... Nigga
I'm on the streets you on the curb
Ain't no talking to police cause we don't speak the same word
Who that, Tryna take the Carter for a new jack
I'll pistol whip you on your block 'til your blue black
(laugh)... Till your blue black (listen)
Alot of niggas like to touch other cities
But my city like to touch other niggas (yea)
You come down for the Essence and the Mardi Gras
But I got here thats where your partys are
Dont shine too hard, watch behind you god
That chain looking like a sign that say ""follow me home""
I'm a desperado from the Hollygrove side
Where alot of folks ride, and a lot of folks died


I'm on the corner with my work in the mailbox
One foot out the grave one foot in the jailhouse
I done put my foot in the flow
To fast feet my cash, get my feet out your ass (yea)
I told momma im gone; I'll be back with money
I came back with the throne; she very proud of me
I tell her pray for me; cause everyday for me
Is a struggle to make of it
They got my nigga Big Blake in the state oven
But he gonna eat a nigga plate when he escape from it
Please label me real cause I ain't make it here faking
Neither was it vacant; take a nigga bacon (shit)
Break bread or we break heads
Put the pump to your stomach turn your face red
Pump a nigga dome now he a bass head
Hit him one more time like stay dead

We ease out the Rolls and proceed forward, ain't a soul I'm passing twice
Feeling like a Graduation with all of these Flashing Lights

You damn right a lot of wives gon’ get smashed tonight
Red carpets, cameras, I say: “Millz yikes”
Shit this must be what victory feel like
Got you niggas stuck like still-life’s

Young Money got 'em about to hurl like Garnett
I throw my hands in the air and scream: “Top of da world''
The champs have arrived thanks for the applause
You are far too kind, now pass us our award

Pass me that H20, I'm in the H2
Passing all my old bitches they hollering out I hate you
New bitches that I don't know like, Mack I wanna date you
Walt Disney on Ice, every time I skate through
I got that blue flame flow, its inferno
Chlamydia type of words, they will burn you
Your flesh is what I burn through, I’m son-ing you niggas, I'm paternal
I ain't going' nowhere, like Joe Paterno
I'm still calling shots from the press box
I make you niggas cough up a lung like S. Dot
Put hot sauce on my bullets, now ya flesh hot
Glove over my shooting hand, when I feel the Tecs hot
You niggas on da bench y’all gets no P.T
Because you can't ball hard like B.D., you niggas wanna be me
When you at home you listen to my CD
And roll your eyes every time you see me
I used to bump to B.G., I got a White House that ain’t in D.C
Try Atlanta nigga, me and my brother Toon
We riding round in Phantoms nigga, and Maybachs
With wheels that cost a fortune like Pat Sajak
And we still got that Vanna White
We done made it from Hollygrove to this, nigga this a Fabulous Life
Honeycomb hideout, Young Money beehive
Let me move to the side here comes the best rapper

And I will not lose

Call me first place Carter, I live in the lead
I’ma die with the title, and winning is vital
Women is after we get that money right now
My paper chase me it’s on my heels like some white socks
I’ma just go, cause I don’t really like stop
Pull this bitch out and shoot you once in da right spot
Y’all niggas phony, the top is so lonely
I had to tell the Devil you gone have to postpone me
Right now I’m in a race, in a race against time
Cause everybody else is like a race against mom
But momma kind a fast though, momma told me smash though
So I’m about to smash yo motherfucking ass ho
Motherfucking asshole, yeah I know this
But when you get cash out da asshole you got to be on some shit
Future billionaire, yeah I got to be on da list
Got a runway in my pants, cause all the models be on my dick
Young Money, Young Money, swallow that shit bitch
Santa Claus killer with a holiday shit list

Greedy I never full gettin fat
And bitch i gotta itch so don't let me catch you wit that scra-scra-scratch
Yall niggas off the face of the earth
Even mase came back for the money outta church
So wit that on my mission for that money imma work
My divine intervention might be in that woman's purse
Tryna find a betta system but im runnin out of perk
Baby daughter tell me erks
Then daddy heart hurts
So daddy pop at em until they heart burst
For my baby girl candy i make her starburst

Cause my god son just became my real son
Think life is a game but all you get is a turn
You live and you learn, either you freeze or you burn

Love turned into hate, hate turned into fear
If it ain't right, I don’t sign the deal

Ain't no collective bargaining on cocaine

Now clip that, take it back to the projects
I obsess over trying to be the best
But if it's no struggle, then it's no progress
And that's a hard pill that I try and digest
I just kill them off soft like Wyclef
Rooms in the sky, dead men fly
These type of words make a grown man cry

If we ain't talking money homie I'll see you later
Kinda faded with this thick bitch looking like Jada
Take her back to the truck, then we fuck
Then I ate her, made her nut

Nah, I'm lyin', shorty on my mind
Shorty like a fryin', pan, and I ain't got
Nothin' but sweat inside my hands
(All around the world, girls, all around the world
This goes out to girls all around the world)
So I dig into my pocket, all my money is spent
But I don't need a cent, 'cause shorty priceless
I tell it like this, I been (all around the world)
So baby I can take you (all around the world)
I roll up, this is a hold up
It's young money man, shorty made me smile
When ain't a damn thing funny
He heh, but still don't nothin' move but the money
So baby if I move then we move with the money
(All around the world, girls, all around the world
This goes out to girls all around the world)
Which is my favorite dish
But if I taste you that'll probably switch
And then we will probably switch
(All around the world
This goes out to girls all around the world)
Now I'm walking up the street, whistling this
Can't get you off my mind
You're like my favorite song (song)
Just want to turn you on
And rock you all night long 'cause I (oh I)
(All around the world, girls, all around the world
This goes out to girls all around the world)
I just want to be your man (I just want to be your man)

This goes out to girls all around the world)
Can't get you off my mind
You're like my favorite song (song)
Just want to turn you on

Let It Rock,The Leak 4,UnKnown,"I see your dirty face, high behind your  pussy stache nigga
Collar
What is done in vain, truth is hard to swallow
So you pray to God
To justify the way you live a lie, live a lie, live a lie
And you take your time and you do your crime
Well you made your bed, I'm in mine

Because when I arrive
I bring the fire, make you come alive
I can take you higher what this is, forgot?
I must now remind you let it rock, let it rock, let it rock
Now the son's disgraced
He, who knew his father
When he cursed his name
Turned, and chased the dollar
But it broke his heart
So he stuck his middle finger
To the world, to the world to the world
And you take your time and you stand in line
Well you'll get what's yours, I got mine

Yeah! Wayne's world
Planet Rock, panties drop
And the tops and she gonna rock 'til the camera stop
And I sing about angels like Angela (rock) and Pamela (rock)
And Samantha (rock) and Amanda and Tamara
I'm in here up like bitch what's up
Mechanic, me, I can fix you up
I can fuck you up, I can fuck you down
Shorty we can go wherever just pick a town
And the jewelry is louder than an engine sound
Big ass rocks like on the ground
Dirty like socks that's on the ground, Weezy

Just let it rock
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock, let it rock
I'm back like I forgot something, I'm something
Rollin' Rock rubbing rap running
Miles like I'm trying to get a flat stomach
Like Wayne the personal trainer
My aim is perfect I'll fuck ya, period, like the reminder
I wish I could be, as cruel as you
And I wish I could say, the things you do
But I can't and I won't live a lie, no not this time",https://genius.com/Lil-wayne-let-it-rock-lyrics

Everybody, just move your feet
All you ladies, come and shake your money maker with me


Up in the club on the Hennessy
Fake booty clowns are shakin' on me
I can barely stand up

Love when we hit the back
You let me hit from the back
And back to floor, lookin' for more

Seen my cousin get popped and got focused
I noticed the route that I've chosen could bring fortune
Plus sometimes it rains too hard so watch where the road is
I hear a lotta hoe shit
Gotta lil something but I'm tryna get some mo' shit
I'm a still thug it out I tell my body's so stiff
Ridin with my slugger I'm feelin kinda bogus with no motive
My main goal is to ball like Lamar Odom
And haul cocaine and use this rap shit as a token
Stress got me smokin a jo' totin a fo' fo' and
Scopin to kick somebody's no' in

Right now, man
The streets of New Orleans is real fucked up, man
But, don't look at it like that cause
I ain't gonna lie, it's so back --
It's not back to normal, cause it'll never be
But, I mean, it's back to a way
That you probably didn't think it would be back to
So, you know what I mean
People are living
People are breathing
But you know what I mean
That shit still was fucked up
And it's gonna always be fucked up
And people are still fucked up about it
And people are still fucked up over it
People died, and that's what's real about it

Scottie Pippen (Version 2),UnKnown,2020.0,"It's so simple that it's complicated, uh
You think about mistakes, that's when you made 'em, yeah
The water's runnin', baby, I ain't chasin'
Cause only in still water we can see our faces
Real shit

Now beam me up, Scotty
You gon' find your mommy chopped up in a tub
With ""Stop snitchin"" written on a note by her body
I picked up your ho and she wore something tiny
I wore something simple, she like that about me
My dope from the nineties, my dope ain't consignment
My coke ain't that diet, I hope you a client
These hoes be relying, these niggas be lying
These niggas who snitching we throw to the lions
Ain't no testifying, you know that's as quiet
So scream until you give your throat laryngitis, we so terrorizing
You cuddle too much, you choose hoes to confide in
I know where you hide and that ho verified it
I told my homie ""I know where to find him""
He said ""You late, we already got him
And by the way, it was an honor""
That made my day, made me so proud
I bought my bitch some shit from her favorite designer
And a chihuahua
What's the occasion? Don't worry about it
I don't fuck with snakes except Kobe, the Mamba
Might cut off my hair 'cause these hoes is Delilah's
Let me check my wallet, my pulse and my vitals
Call me the greatest or call me retired
It's up in the air, like carbon monoxide
Bitch, we in the building, we started from outside
My dick is my third eye and she call it cock eyed
My bath tub lift up, my walls do a 360
She get so wet, it can be sea sickening
Niggas expect some sort of leniency
I'm in high def, but why are you screening me?
I'm Weezy F-U, with a sick dick
Hop on my skateboard, do a quick trick
Playin' my role, even with a thick script
Waitin' on a revolution, hope I get a big tip
Smoking on Cee-Lo Green, lighting up a big gift
Every bud get nipped, life is so vibrant and the suns just trip
Anything can happen, put the ""Whats"" with the ""Ifs""
But what's with the ifs?
Just pass that weed like flying - colors
Light green teal turquoise, purple
When I'm in a room, if these walls could talk
I'm sure they'd prefer to be non-verbal
Poppa was a rolling stone, worthless
Momma said I wasn't on, purpose
That's why I got a ice box where my heart used to be in this cold world
I'm a monster, a cold blooded monster
I'm colder than fuckin' Moscow, kilos, ounces, Grammies, Oscars
Knock you off your fuckin' high horse
Like a cold blooded jouster, fighting for my life
Praying to the ring-side announcer

It's so simple that it's complicated, yeah
You think about mistakes, that's when you made 'em, yeah
The water's runnin', baby, I ain't chasin'
Cause only in still water we can see our faces
Real shit, tell 'em

I don't need no pot to piss in, I just need a pot to whip it
I don't need no fuckin' help, I don't need no Scottie Pippen
I don't need a lot of niggas, I just need a chopper, nigga

I got corner honor
Ain't been to court since 2004
Looks like I got it goin', your honor
I'm a lone rider, grind for my own dollars
They was in front, but I blow by 'em
I'm all holes like corn-rolls, open toes
Fake titties, yes, I bought both of those
Hold your nose, I'm the shit, can't be flushed
I got the toilet stopped up, call the plumber up

Lock and load, pull the triggers and roll, yeah
The bigger your mouth, the bigger the hole, yeah

They lawn chairs, baby, quicker to fold
But me, I'm quick on my toes, I remember the code

Still rock too much ice, shoulda got you a visor

Fresh like I just stepped outta the drier

 the whole block's behind me
Yeah, stay low, the cops are spyin'
But they could never figure out the rocket science
No pocket knife, no pocket iron
Yeah, pots and pans make the pockets wider
Dig 'em a hole, let the property hide 'em
Build a house and throw a party over your dead body
Never said I never fell, but never dropped an assignment
Gotta finish what you start or the cops'll find it
Dinner in the park, yeah it may seem cool
But me, I'd rather not let 'em see my food
I'm stayin' strapped like Fila shoes
Bet I bust a motherfucker till the enemy move
C'mon, it's my game, nigga, get in and lose
Ya'll niggas never did what I do
I do me..

Streets'll swallow you in this
So many bricks that you could build a mansion
With the house guest house, and a room for expansion
Twelve rooms, eight baths, don't make me laugh
Twelve rounds on my hip, don't make me blast
It ain't no secret, hoes is about it
Was flippin' that soft white before I ever became famous
A few tried, but they shall remain nameless
Lunar eclipse, they try to block my shine
Say what the fuck you want, can't stop my grind
One million, two million, three million, four
What the hell, maybe it's twelve
So listen little mane, this before the rap game
Before them videos, before all of them shows

Hello Brooklyn how you doing
Where you going and can I come too
And if I can I'ma be your man
You could be my lady and have my baby
And drive my car and drive me crazy
Wherever your going baby girl just take me
Cause I'm so taken if you taken
I'm just saying baby I'm just saying
Like a mamma you birthed me, Brooklyn you nursed me
Schooled me with hard knocks, better than Burkley
They say you murked me by the time I was 21
That shit disturbed me, but you never hurt me
Hello Brooklyn, if we had a daughter
Guess what I'ma call her, Brooklyn carter
When I left you for Virginia it didn't offend ya
Cause you know I only stepped out to get dinner
And I'm eating, so much I bought extra
So much so that dinners now turned into breakfast
I only roll Lexus to hug your road
I love your corners, I'm half your soul
Hello Brooklyn

Hello Brooklyn
Whats your story, she said she's eating on the run but she ain't Nore
She said she's got a man but he ain't worried
But baby I'ma have to rob him like Orie
She said she love B.I.G. and she likes 2Pac
And when I said Jay-Z she said it's the Roc
I'ma leave it like this like this like that
Where Brooklyn at, where Brooklyn at
Have you seen her, and when she tell you something you better believe her
She told me she like my new Orleans demeanor
And so I said goodbye Katrina and hello Brooklyn
But baby you are the sweetest site eyes could see
I said hello Brooklyn, but baby I hope you never say goodbye to me
I said hello Brooklyn, but baby you are so damn fine to me
And I remember the time, place and the weather from the day you said hi to me
And I say hello Brooklyn
Brooklyn you crazy look how you made me
Razor blades in my mouth walking 'round behaving
Or demented black hoodies and timberland'd
Always scheming you see the gleam on that niggas pendant
Hello Brooklyn, you bad influence
Look what you had me doing
But I ain't mad at you, look at my attitude it says my life's too real
Check out my ice grill baby I'm cold as ice
I come from Brownsville but my ""beds in the 'stye""
Blow la la ""flatten your bush"" till we smoking c.i
What up to the boy d.i. you know I handle B.I
I don't half step on the 'caine, ask the dreads 'bout I
How you want it slow she like it hard cold
So I grind slow iller than out in square mall back in the 9-0
My fine hoe we got some victims to catch
So in a couple years baby I'ma bring you some next

But baby you are the sweetest site eyes could see
I said hello Brooklyn, but baby I hope you never say goodbye to me
I said hello Brooklyn, but baby you are so damn fine to me
And I remember the time, place and the weather from the day you said hi to me
And I say hello Brooklyn",https://genius.com/Lil-wayne-hello-brooklyn-20-lyrics

I just don't wanna fight anymore, even forever but on you and for
And if you think this is the way to be, I'm sorry this ain't no worth on me
And I know, I know, that no one's perfect
But what's the purpose, if we can't even make it through the day
Without fighting, we can't even get along
I would just rather let it go, cause you soon already know that
I'm a lover, I'm a lover, I'm a lover, I'm a lover
Not a fighter, not a fighter, not a fighter, not a fighter X 3
Don't even matter, what you sayin'
Right now I just need some time so I can do some thinking
Will this be the end of me and you, whoa, whoa
All I know is that I'm stressed out
Seems like we've tried everything I gave me best shot
Now and every time for us to go in the town
I know, that no one's perfect
But what's the purpose, if we can't even make it through the day
Without fighting, we can't even get along

Girl love is a must, so don't put up a fuss
I'm hard as steel, she wet, making rust
With you nobody, and I'm somebody
... around it, yeah, haha
All we do is fussin, don't start honey
And I put that ... and make you up funny
Yeah, PJ, young money, New Orleans, and it really don't start nothing
Won't be nothing, let me say something
I'm a lover not a fighter, but I think I told you that
I know, that no one's perfect
But what's the purpose, if we can't even make it through the day
Without fighting, we can't even get along

And let me geranimo geranimo all up in your cameltoe
Girl i got the antidote
Let me medicate you and get vetenarial
Imma eat you like a lion eat an antelope on an animal planet show
Shes on to me now
We born to be wild
She sworn that she vow imma only denial?
Catch her on the rebound
Animalistic sexual tendencies express them tremendously
And work out the chemistry enjoy the intensity, serenity
We bout that wild life
We bout that high life
We get higher than eyesight
And then we just skydive
Mentality in a phase radicals in a rage
Valuables in a blaze hot animals in a cage
(Jojee)
Medicate me like a mental case
Cuz I'm an animal in a cage
In my bed we'll take the stage
Cuz we're just animals in a cage
(Lil Wayne)
You know you know you know
Under my wing its so different
You know in that cage I go Nicholas
Up in that cage I go Johnny
And I pull this elephant out
She lookin edible now
Like she ain't been pet in awhile
Yeah I pull this elephant out
She put on a sexier smile
Like she ain't been fed in awhile
Animals in a cage
Cameras in a cage
Dont be naked and afraid we some animals in a cage girl
Got candles lit in the cage girl
And we lit in the cage girl
(Jojee)
Medicate me like a mental case
Cuz I'm an animal in a cage
In my bed we'll take the stage
Cuz we're just animals in a cage

Animals in a cage
Cameras in a cage
Dont be naked and afraid we some animals in a cage girl
Got candles lit in the cage girl
And we lit in the cage girl

Sleazy,UnKnown,UnKnown,"I don't need you or your brand new Benz
Or your bouji friends
I don't need love looking like diamonds
Looking like diamonds

Okay I'm young and I'm tatted
I get them bucks like an addict
In this Christian Dior, I spend so much on my fabric
I got a wifey at home and what she wants she can have it
And she in love with my stick, she say I work it like magic
Okay no need to panic, I'm on a beach where the sand is
Somewhere smokin' on medication, no I won't need a bandage
Some would look at my age and try to say I'm young and I'm handsome
I say I'm filthy fucking rich, so I'm an old dirty bastard
And my cribs a disaster and my kush is the master
I was in my yellow car but my Ferrari go faster
Sounding like a band in it and my diamonds the dancers
On the remix with Kesha, bout to go see the cashier
On the grind so now my watch has got a lot of diamonds in it
I look down and see a hundred thou' and think its time to get it
Brought a lot of marijauna and I'm here to share it
No it's not a problem, better get it, then I won't be here tomorrow momma
 x2
I don't need you or your brand new Benz
Or your bouji friends
And I don't need love looking like diamonds
Looking like diamonds

We start out so cute in our baby pictures
That momma shot for our daddy so that HE wouldn't forget you
He forgot anyway, but hey, one day he'll remember
If not he's human, I'm human, you human, we'll forgive him
God gives him his ultimatum, can't see how momma hates him
He's such a cool ass guy, then wonder why she date him
I'm only 8, I'm not old enough, guess it's complicated
Two parent dwellings, expelling have got so underrated
I only say this in cadence so it don't get negated
I was gon' save it for later but later look like maybe
This crazy lady named Kesha is guessing my Mercedes
Would be all new and through through, but its the 1980s
But now that we are cool cool, she sippin' Irish Baileys
She say ""Stacks, you're true blue?""
I said ""Nah, I'm Navy""
I call her Kesha, she like it, because it's hood to her
She call me Andre 6000 because I'm good to her
 x2
I don't need you or your brand new Benz
Or your bouji friends
And I don't need love looking like diamonds
Looking like diamonds

Hey Kesha what up boo its me
Do you know what to do wit me?
Bad bitches, I got two of me
Well you better make it two or three
Bad bitches know me so don't bother introducing me
They want me more than diamonds
Wipe me down bitch, I'm super clean
I'm hella cold, mega paid, making moves doing things
Bitches stay queued and they all wanna do the king
I'm ballin', royalty, knew it when I seen her
I was gonna take her, make her my new royal penis cleaner
My demeanor something special and this dick is so impressive
Bitch I bet you take it off and take it with you if I let you
I ain't trippin', I'm just here, couldn't catch you when I catch you
Bitch my swagger super natural
Get you pregnant looking at you
I ain't nothing like them other dudes
I'm an atom bomb, they a molecule
Still paint ballin' out the frame, stuntin' like a fool

I don't need you or your brand new Benz
Or your bouji friends
I don't need love looking like diamonds
Looking like diamonds
Rat-a-tat-tat on your dum-dum drum
The beat's so fat gonna make me come
Um, um, um, over to your place!
Rat-a-tat-tat on your dum-dum drum
The beat's so fat, gonna make me come
Um, um, um, over to your place!

We be on that shit that no one be on
Thats what we one, smoke that neon
Kings of Leon, Dynamite Napoleon
Got some skinny's and a tee on
And some vans and my mans got the ratchet
While I'm laying in some pussy you be laying in a casket
And I'm just saying, I'm just spazzing
Im just smashing, Im just nasty
If you 'bout it, bust it open
Oh you fancy man, I got so many flows like mansion
Catch a tantrum, know a girl called Cleopatra
She a throw that pussy at ya
I'm financially straight like a lion
I ain't lying
And all my hoes on they toes
Ballerina, Black Swan
Man we on Ciroc, Grey Goose
It's Weezy baby, sleazy baby
Young Mula baby!

You drive me crazy, I got road rage
My top down in the rain, it's a cold day
Gave you my heart, you let me die, that's a cold case
They say we running out of time, I walked the whole race
I walked the whole race
All I ever wanted was someone to call my own 
(That's all)
All a nigga need is for you to call my phone 
(That's all)
All that talk about true love, truly wasn't true
And all that shit you you loved, you just wasn't you

And I know that you ain't used to hearing me at a tempo this slow
But I just had to slow it down and break it down
So you can hear me when I say

I need you
I'm nothing without you
A zero without you, baby
I need you
I'm nothing without you
A zero without you, baby

You ain't even told me ""Happy New Year,"" yeah
You starting the year off with that bullshit
Fuck it, I'ma take a shot for you, cheers
I'ma do me better than you did
You don't like it when I talk like that
But you don't bite, you just bark right back, with your dog ass
I feel played, you rained on my parade
But that's on me, I should've checked the forecast
And you don't like it when I talk like that
Hang up in my face and call right back, with your crazy ass
But that's okay 'cause when he throw you away
One man's treasure was another one's trash

And I know that you ain't used to hearing me at a tempo this slow
But I just had to slow it down and break it down
So you can hear me when I say

You drive me crazy, I got road rage, I'm fucking up the curb
You gon' get what you deserve, a house on a hill
A man to pay the bills but that nigga ain't real
Tell me what happened to trust? What happened to us?
You said you'd walk me through the bullshit like a crush but left me crushed

We don't even talk no more
We ran out of words to say, yeah
We don't even laugh no more
We ran out of games to play

Still armed and dangerous
Real nigga, take my own charge like LaDainian
Wild like a, Tasmanian devil, metal your cranium
I got my guap in a headlock; wrestlemania
Ha! man, I do what I do, look at all the bullshit I been through
Some call beef with you know who - but I turn that to beef stew
Rapper eater eat you, and if we stop the beat
You can probably still hear me picking rappers from my teeth
I’m the last of the elite
I got money, fuck a friend
Got them goons on deck like pitchers in the bullpen
On them Lil Weezy Ana streets, nigga fuck where you been
On a scale of 1 to 10, shawty I’m a 10

Thug-ass niggas that love to bust, it's strange to us
Y'all niggas be scramblin', gamblin'
Up in restaurants with mandolins and violins
We just sittin' here tryna win, try not to sin
High off weed and lots of gin
So much smoke, need oxygen
Steadily countin' them Benjamins
Nigga, you should too, if you knew
What this game'll do to you
Been in this shit since '92
Look at all the bullshit I been through
So-called beef with you-know-who
Fucked a few female stars or two
Then I blew like nigga move like Mike
Shit, not to be fucked with
Motherfucker better duck quick
'Cause me and my dogs love to buck shit
Fuck the luck shit, strictly aim
No aspirations to quit the game
Spit yo game, talk yo shit
Grab yo gat, call yo clique
Squeeze yo clip, hit the right one
Pass that weed, I got to light one
All them niggas, I got to fight one
All them hoes, I got to like one

Please feel me, Sqad Up nigga, (For Real)
I'ma dig deep folk, Dig deep dogg, (Its Real)
Now listen, Now what you is?
(Verse 1)
I am what you call a survivor, like trouble with drama
But I recover with power, and love it with honor
Discovered as a son of a problem
Remember smugglin powder throught the doors of my high school
To force up they nostril, 'til it got full
But now they pop for a pill
Lil one here's what's up, Drugs could kill
But drugs could heal
If ya, ahh, ill for that good feel
And it feels good when them fields pull
We wheels quarters through the real raw parts of the streets
My hearts in the streets, So watch what ya step
When ya run from the gunfire of Glocks and Tech's
Specials and Pumps, Vests is for chumps
Eat ya chests for lunch, munch
Young country dude, hunt ya down with tools
Repsect my presence, I step with weapons
You fall in seconds
Its all in the code of the streets, we go by it and stop from it
Real nigga talk, No frontin
Heh
(Chorus)
Do you understand the words that are comin out of my mouth?
If ya dont its because I'm speakin real nigga
Real nigga, This here is real nigga talk
Real nigga talk dogg, I hope you feel me
Let me talk to you dogg, You gotta feel me
I hope you feel me, You gotta feel me
Listen
(Verse 2)
Chrome's hidden inside of my tires
You should see the size of my tires
Ridin' on Mark McGwires, I spark the fire
Got me higher than a late flight
From L.A. to New York twice in the same night
Got some shit in my bag to make ya vein white, Cocaine pipe
Watch homie's brains get rain whipped
Thats the type of sight to make Wayne right
They sayin life is short but money is long, And money is life
So for now I'm runnin the lights, in the 600 with pipes
Hop out, Collar Polo, and under the stripes is something that bites
We will be thuggin for life
And can't nothin pursuede or change us
We gangstas, we live it, I'm in the post without a Pippen
But fuck it, I'm just shootin when I can't move
Who'da knew I can't lose
And truthfully through the loot that's Young Money Entertainment
You get it arranged then holla at me
(Chorus w/ minor variations)
(Verse 3)
I burn in the winter, stand up in the fall
Stand up in the stands, and stand up for my dogs
Them asses I will spall, the plan is too ball
But the stuff I got in my pants cuff
Is enough to make'em put my hands on the wall
Work, push on the strip, I'm pushin the whip
Fat back pockets, my cushion if I'm lookin to slip
I'm hookin ya lip, If ya play hookie with my chips
Put that ass kitchen, bitch, when ya cookin that shit
Dodge hoes, jukin and shit
Cause I can see beautiful women, but I'm not lookin for shit
I'm from the hood where you tooken for shit
So you gotta take the shit, and make ya shit
I had to bring home the bacon bits
Cause Pop's was fakin, and he left a nigga bakin shit
Now my heart ache and itch, from all the flagrant shit
I gotta take in, and thug out

Young Money in this motherfucker

There is no peace
I ride 'till there is no wheels
Till there is no streets
Like where is my piece
They dying in them cells or already dead
Or tryna kill themselves
I rep my niggas, I love my city
I feel myself and she feel my wealth
So it will not help, I gotta get me
And money like pussy and I gotta get deep
So I gotta get street cause it's riding on me
My niggas can't drive, I got riders with me
And nah I ain't into that back and forth chit chat
As a matter fact I'mma end that
Prone to destruction, home is corrupted
Stones in my dungies won't do the justice
Them hundred dollar homes is in abundance
Hustle on a mountain, hustle in a tundra
Get that money or don't function
Punctuation exclamation exclamation period
That's the way I have to make it
S to K, you better take it, idiots period
Bullshit, I pity it
Them guns shot so loud you would think I MIDI'd it
I shot more than once, I'm ab-libing it
Oh well you been in hell so what, I live in it
I'm giving it all I got for them incentives
Riding for them benefits and now it's back to 10 a brick
I like 'em thin and thick
Really I like 'em thick, high yellow and shit

Hot Spitta, nigga, flow so sick
Sidekick talkin' to my older bitch
I had to leave her, 'cause she was too controlling and shit
I'm like ""you can't have me, I'm too young for you bitch""
They got these niggas in the street tryna 
That's cool, bring it, I got guns for you son
I'm talkin' about 17 other Glocks with the beam
Homie, I guarantee that I don't miss
Hot Spitta ride slow
Two burners on the seat

Hold on, hold on, hold on
Yeah, well not because of my size
Hey, yo, hey, yo hey, ho, haha
I might as well get me a bitch to say my name on all my songs

Nigga, I'm young as a motherfucker
But money a motherfucker
Young Money motherfucker
Get it in blood puddles, shit
I'm in the South, where we livin' in mud puddles
Shit is a drug struggle when you niggas uppin' prices
I hug the Glock like a turnbuckle
Can't get stopped by the vices, no license
Rollin' like dices on the streets
Where the odds is high
Where the crime is life
And the life is time
And the time is jail
And in the jail you stressin'
The judge probably hit me wit an algebraic expression
But I get away free like Ocean's 11
And I motion the metal
Like a pro-fiessional
And I'm rollin' especially like a pimp supposed to
Watch how you sit down, something's in that sofa
If she wit me, you know that something's in that hoe bra
She's a foreigner, so she say coca
I get broke off, and they get brok-er
They like ""so what?""
I'm like ""so when?""
We gon' know then
How to turn in, turn out
'Cause we gon' shoot back
'Till the burners burn out
'Till the burnin' burn down every house the block hold
I'm hollerin' at you niggas with every shot the Glock hold
You can't see me, there's a thousand blindfolds
And my mindstate, is put a thousand on top of those
I do school and do lunch at Pappadeuax's
They want beef, I turn that to sloppy joes
Copycats brrrrat, copy those
I got a strong relationship wit expensive clothes
This stuntin' shit is extensive and intense
Like pullin' up in somethin' Americans can't invent
I make 'em fall back, they gotta indent
Like a paragraph, the first sentence
Shit, I'm way smarter, man, I'm more gifted
Straight from the womb to pro, prolific
I'm so, I'm so so, I'm so lifted
High in the sky, me and pops takin' pictures
That's my vision, until my vision is vivid
I'ma give it all I got

Watch my fingers make a capital B
I throw gang signs up and don't care where they land
I know the whole 17 got my back
The backbone of my hood, I'm the spleen of my trap
I know some niggas that think it's Iraq
There is death in the air, you might catch a contact
You may need to shorten the lean after that
Man, I swear I drunk so much of lean, I almost passed
Not tryna say I've been clean after that
But let's just say that is a thing of the past
But can you picture the scene after that?
No more Lil Tunechi, no more king of rap
Life can be gone in a blink of an eye
Lord, I guess I just be blinkin' too fast

Can't believe its real love, can't believe its not lust

In exchange for yourself, you can get yo bitch back

I can make a broke bitch rich
But I don't fuck with broke bitches
When a rich nigga want you (want you baby)
And your nigga can't do nothing for ya (no, nothing)
These hoes ain't loyal
These hoes ain't loyal
Yeah, yeah, let me see
With ciroc in the system
Ain't no telling will I fuck them, will I diss them
That's what they be yelling, I'm a pimp by blood
No relation, I don't chase 'em, I replace 'em
LVs, Hermes, Dolces
Them hoes ain't loyal. Man, they rotate
School me to the game, now I know my duty
Put her in a Lotus
She was riding in a hoopty
Fuck that bitch
I got my own hoe
Fuck your weed
I got my own smoke
Had to put my mink back on
Tell that bitch
Put a ring back on
Montana
Come on, come on, girl
Why you frontin'?
Baby show me something
When I call her, she gon' leave
And I bet that bottom dollar she gon' cheat
Come on, come on, girl
Why you frontin'?
Baby show me something
You just spent your ring on her
And it's all for nothing
When a rich nigga want you (want you baby)
And your nigga can't do nothing for ya (can't do nothing for you)
These hoes ain't loyal
These hoes ain't loyal
Yeah, yeah, let me see
When a rich nigga want you (want you baby)
And your nigga can't do nothing for ya
These hoes ain't loyal (they be playing games)

Love Affair,UnKnown,UnKnown,"I'm dealing with this love affair
It used to be just physical
But now it's just too emotional for me
I wanna confess but I can't
Tell my girl what I want
So what do I do
Let it burn inside of me
Will I get away
Or will it end in tragedy
Fatal attraction ready for action
She had a body like Ms. Jackson
I knew there was trouble when she passed by
But she was so fly
She invited me over
So I hopped in the Rover
Then my lady called the phone
And I should of went home
But I let the phone roam
And it was like
Oh
I can't keep my shirt on
I swear it's was like
Oh
I can't keep my hands to myself
I'm dealing with this love affair
It used to be just physical
But now it's just too emotional for me
I wanna confess but I can't
Tell my girl what I want
So what do I do
Let it burn inside of me
Will I get away
Or will it end in tragedy
I swear that I was done
I'm never going back
Then she called me up
She said I left my hat
You know I can't live without my hat
I got an excuse double back y'all
So you know I'm gonna have a ball
I said I'm going back y'all
Believe me that's not all
And now I'm like
Oh
I can't keep my shirt on
I swear it's like
Oh (Young Money)
I can't keep my hands to myself
I'm dealing with this love affair
It used to be just physical
But now it's just too emotional for me
I wanna confess but I can't
Tell my girl what I want
So what do I do
Let it burn inside of me
Will I get away
Or let it end in tragedy
Uh, I got a main bitch and a mistress
I'm trying to work it out, I'm on my fitness
Probably won't last, but I'm optimistic
One makes me happy, the other one makes a difference
I ain't a player, but I love a lot
She loves me, she loves me not
But it feel good, and it's not supposed to
I eat her insides, mm soul food
She put her head back, then her eyes close
We stuck in the moment like the time froze
Then my girl call, back to reality
But I keep her in a picture in my heart gallery, oh!
Oh (Yeah)
I can't keep my shirt on
I swear it's like
Oh
I can't keep my hands to myself
I'm dealing with this love affair
It used to be just physical
But now it's just too emotional for me

Grenade,UnKnown,UnKnown,"And I don’t mind when we fall out
As long as we fall back into it
I hope we never put an end to it
Even though you not that into it
Heaven, have you ever been to it
Cause you look like you never been
You’re more like a Hell’s angel
And for you, I’d rather sin
Broken heart, Love you with a broken heart
For you I’ll jump off Noah’s Ark
Love is blind and hope is dark
But why does pain feel so good
Love is science, live for you
Die for you, and I’ll die smiling
Easy come, easy go
That’s just how you live, oh
Take, take, take it all
But you never give
Should of known you was trouble from the first kiss
Had your eyes wide open
Why were they open?
Gave you all I had
And you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, you did
To give me all your love is all I ever asked
Cause what you don’t understand is

I’d catch a grenade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Throw my hand on a blade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I’d jump in front of a train for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know I’d do anything for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, oh
I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for ya baby;
But you won’t do the same
No, no, no, no
Black, black, black and blue beat me till I’m numb
Tell the devil I said “hey” when you get back to where you’re from
Mad woman, bad woman
That’s just what you are, yeah
You’ll smile in my face then rip the brakes out my car
Gave you all I had
And you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, yes you did
To give me all your love is all I ever asked
Cause what you don’t understand is

I’d catch a grenade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Throw my hand on a blade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I’d jump in front of a train for ya (yeah, yeah , yeah)

Oh, oh
I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for ya baby;
But you won’t do the same
If my body was on fire, ooh
You’d watch me burn down in flames
You said you loved me you’re a liar
Cause you never, ever, ever did baby…
But darling I’ll still catch a grenade for ya
Throw my hand on a blade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I’d jump in front of a train for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know I’d do anything for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, oh

Why you in your purse when I want to tell you something?
Why you on the phone after 2 in the morning?
Who the fuck you talking to at 2 in the morning, girl?
I feel it's over, you know it's over with
You get my feelings and time and shit
I'm in my feelings, it's all over
And you know what is right, so come over tonight
Don't want fuss and fight, let's get right
Right now a nigga feeling so nice
And I feel like I owe you something
Let me show you something, girl

Girl I, girl I just wanna
Just wanna keep you satisfied

That’s Not Luv (Remastered Version),UnKnown,2016.0,"That’s not love
That’s not love
(On the real side)
That’s not love, (You dig)
Not real true love

Snakes in the grass, so I stay on the pavement
Survived the battle when Adam was a cavemen
And dead animals and dead men
I’m all in and my only friend is Amen
Keep your mouth closed, you wanna know why you die?
The answer’s right under your nose
Expose to the streets, in the game I don’t cheat
I had to play my position, get MVP
I get money don't shit come free
It's my life and i'm runin' even with numb feet
Keep my business in my pocket, don't wash with bleach
And I never show my hand, not even to me, you see

That’s not love
That’s not love

Look, as the crooked world revolves
Love spelled backwards is evolve
The evil spelled backward was just live or live
And When death comes you better have life to give
I spit that real talk like knives to ribs
And rats die ugly, die with kids
These niggas stitchin' and still livin'
I hope my words are like razor's to them bitches
Niggas pretend like they there to dig in
But when they go down and fuck around and be them
That blood live for millon when it's leakin'
If you scared go see a deacon, nigga

24′s so you know we roll heavy
Welcome to my hood
They outside playing hopscotch
And every know this is the hot spot
Welcome to my hood
Them boys will put you down on your knees
(Woop, woop) That’s the sound of the police
In my hood
Audemar on my wrist
Diamond, look like they glowing
50 stacks, all singles, I make it look like its snowing
Black unmarked cars, gotta peep how they playin’
Treat ‘em like jack boys, catch ‘em slippin’ then slay ‘em
Lord forgive me for my sins
That’s my confessions if they put me in this benz
I got possession of a federal offence
I’m talking pressure in my criminal intent
So wear ya vest’s and I’m still gon’ stunt
Like it ain't no tomorrow, fuck ya house note nigga
Blow that bitch on a bottle
The Ferrari just a front, got the Lambo in the back
Tell you “we the best forever” DJ Khaled handle that

I know some niggas from my hood that would rob Norieaga
I’m talkin’ Norieaga, nigga, the real Norieaga
If you ain't from the hood, bitch, than stop impersonating us
And tell congress when you see ‘em bitch I’m stealin’ cable
And leave the D-Boys alone ’cause they motivate us
And why is the half of my whole hood on papers
Some are on house arrest, some are on child support
Some of ‘em did they bit, the other half waiting to go to court
Mr Landlord we gon bust your ass with an eviction note
Better have the police with you dog, if you came to repo
I’m talking strip clubs, I’m talking liquor stores
We throw our money round here, but y’all can…

Bitch I’m on probation, so my nerves bad
And they say time fly’s, well mine’s first class
I landed in the sky, I fell from the streets
I talk a lot of shit and practice what I preach
Back from hell, cell 23, tell the warden kiss my ass
Pockets on Monique
Bitch I’m from the murder capital
Hoe, I’m far from practical
Shit happens and since I’m the shit, I’m who it happens to

I spit it for niggas who will never see mercy
Throwback New Orleans number 17 jersey
Bang bang eagle gang early
If you heard a verse thirsty, I got your cup
I put killa flow on ya plate eat it up paw
And every slow song needed
My shit already seasoned
No pepper added the boy is acid
Fee yelling from the sideline ""boy he don't pass it""
I tuck and scramble and 100 yard dash it
I tuck it handle coming out my pants
Its like fucking animal, blame it on my past tense
You niggas running trying to catch up wit my past tense
Ya need your ass kicked, maybe your run faster
Dumb bastard, this is Young Money and me I'm the young master
Ask for Weezy shit
Im SQAD Up niggas telling me to kill it
Knowin when we come out we gone dumb out
Glocks rung out, shots rung out
Party flyers reading no party if the SQAD come out
Cuz it's no party when them nines come out
When you're trynna dance and your man's spine come out
My tec did that
Not me, my tec did dat
I thought it was a bitch song but niggas is yelling ""my neck, my back""
I ain't respecting that
Petty ballers step with that
We major just cope, we neglected crack
U.S. lets get Clinton elected back
Cuz Bush got the hood on a hectic lack
But I'm good at this I practice techniques
Wrestle the streets Cactus Jack
How black is that?
My flow a civil rights act attack
The spine of the neighborhood back is back
That Weezy; That Baby; That Hot Boya
Have your lady that hot and bothered
That gangsta that pimp that balla
Name ringin in the streets like a black tomas
Name ringin hustle like I gotta smack bonas
Name keep ringin till the feds smack on us
Name ringin in then game like I clash Jordan
Young field still young, name 
ringin in the school classroom like I'm Zach Morris
Team ringin in New Orleans like we are that Hornets team
I got the maybe peach? under garments clean?
In a Bentley limousine, know what I mean?
Weezy is king

Sex In The Lounge,UnKnown,UnKnown,"I think I gave him a discrete name; he replied with a street name
P.R. at the heat game, no ball, repeat game
He addicted to hustle; I'm addicted to fame
Though he packin' that muscle, I'm addicted to brain
I'm addicted to chilling, make a hell of a killing
Don't I stunt on these bitches? Man I'm bad as a villain
Get the gun, I'ma hunt 'em, when I'm done, I'm a don 'em
When we leaving the lounge, I'ma keep it a hundred
It went down, enough said, pull off in that thing, and it's blush red
Sex in the lounge, girl, I'm gon' take ya down
I'm gon' have you screaming, girl, they gonna hear the sound
Of our sex in the lounge
I can't believe this has happened to me, girl
Happened to me, girl oh why
So caught up in this girl
Shawty, got me hooked right now
Keeping true to myself, cause I'm so into her
Cause we doing it like nobody's around
And when we doing it, I can hear her make a sound
Shawty was singing like me
Had that girl singing, singing like me
She be like, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh why
She looking at me like she want it
I'm over here
She climbing on top of me
I'ma make her scream, her scream

I'm gon' have you screaming, girl, they gonna hear the sound
Of our sex in the lounge
I can't believe this has happened to me, girl
Happened to me, girl oh why
Sit that pussy on my bottom lip
Then, after that, you know we gotta switch
My house so big that bitch came with a lobby
We didn't use a rubber, but I came on her body
I lay her down and kiss her neck and talk dirty to her
Like I get that pussy wetter than a dirty sewer
Fuck with me, turn around and bust it open for me
Get on that dick and get that money, go Oprah for me
All you girls don't like me, cause they know you love me
But if you scared, go to church, it's open Sunday
I-I-I dig, I dig in that pussy, guess what I find
Tunechi Lee and Nicki, sex in the lounge
Sex in the lounge, girl, I'm gon' take ya down

Now she should change her name to Mrs. Wayne
Cause she say every time I'm gone she miss Wayne
But she has a better man at home, but she say I'm better than her man at home
I understand, and I like the way you look when you walk
Cause you switch like the sand and the hook and hope you mean err thing you saying in the hook
Cause I'll steal your heart and show your man what I took

And everybody puttin' them over things
Fought with 'em both, we can bring it on

I could give a fuck if you agree with me
'Cause I don't see nobody giving up no greenery
And everybody wanna be up on the scenery
Nigga look me eye to eye but he ain't seein' me
And all these niggas run around sayin' they seen a key
Ain't got a motherfucking thing, ain't seen a G
But always got they mouth open when it comes to me
I wanna know what the fuck you niggas done for me (Tell me, tell me)
Pussy motherfuckers probably run from me
Make me slap ya in ya mouth to get a gum from me
And you know it's only real niggas that run with me
So if I die, probably little niggas will come from me
Shit, it's gonna take like 10 million just to come for me
Yeah, I'm eatin' but I still feel hungry
You know I don't give a motherfuck, yeah I done this shit
And I'm done with it but don't fuck with me

And everybody open they mouths but they ain't 'bout what I'm 'bout
We can bring it on
We can bring it on

Look, and I ain't worried 'bout the law neither
I ain't got nothin' on me, bitch, I'm all legal
And niggas sayin' what they saw talkin' to them people
They got my people in the place without them charges on 'em
And I get charged every day in my charger, homie
And I don't beef with niggas 'cause they all below me
And I don't eat with niggas 'cause we all ain't hungry
It's time to get this money, nigga, fuck your feelings
Who the fuck is gonna take care of your children, shit
Who was there when we were on top of them buildings, shit
I'm over my head, I'm on top of the ceiling
But I'm being real and that's how a nigga feel, fuck
And motherfuck how a motherfucker feel, yeah
I'm tryna feel how I feel to touch a meal
And everybody tryna get a deal
But my mind on these bricks and I'm on the bill

They tryna get me stuck in a hole
Only got one soul, I know

To listen to me whine

Shit, I'm above a star
And now I done got so high
I did forgotten who you are

Oh oh oh, ah, oh oh eh eh
Ah ah
Oh oh oh, ah, oh oh eh eh
Oh oh oh, ah, oh oh eh eh
Ah ah
I'm in love with you
But I can't be with you
Tomorrow I'll be back
Up on the first flight
Right up out of town
Young mullah, baby
Hop back in my spaceship
Girl, I gotta drop your ass off
(Oh oh eh eh)
Last night, yeah we were spaced girl
You love it, girl, I gotta take off
(Oh oh eh eh)
'Cause I'm a be here next week
So call your company and take off
Oh oh oh, yeah oh oh eh
'Cause she say, ""Wayne, Wayne""
So she got me all impatient
Cry me a river
I can hear my conscious
While I say aloud
Boy, you got a problem

And you ain't foolin' no one
But yourself
You're like a hot revolver

But you ain't killin' no one
But yourself

On her own
And you go by yourself
So all alone
I told her, I can be with her
But I can't be with her
As much as she like me to
She like me too much
That's the problem
Oh my God, then Shorty be whillin'
And when I say I got to leave
You wouldn't believe
All of the things that she'll do
And all of the things
That she'll say to make me stay
And I be like, 'Damn'
I'm not going for forever
I'll be back someday
But she wanna go with me
To outer space
So we made love in the Milky Way
And then I send her on her way
Boy, you got a problem
(Problem)
And you ain't foolin' no one
But yourself
You're like a hot revolver
But you ain't killin' no one
But yourself
And so she's gone to party town
On her own
And you go by yourself
So all alone
Now she's not picking up the phone
I don't know what to do
Thinking about visiting her home
Landing my space ship on her roof
Going through her bedroom window
Only to find a man shoe on the floor
Oh no
Oh no
Oh oh no
And I'm like
Who am I to blame
When she was pleading wayne
If you ever leave again
I don't wanna see you anymore
Hop back in my space ship
Hope that I don't spot you at all
Eh eh oh
Because baby if I see you
I'm a probably knock your ass out
Eh eh oh
Put you in the trunk
Throw him over the bridge and take off
Boy, you got a problem
(Problem)
And you ain't foolin' no one
But yourself
You're like a hot revolver
But you ain't killin' no one

Soo Woop,UnKnown,UnKnown,"I hate gossip… and I don’t walk around
Looking for it ya know
But yesterday it seemed to just wonder
Around until it found me
You know like gossip found me
And why don’t you try it
Huh, you don’t know
Well what you just do is…
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop
[Lil Wayne
Verse1]
Stop, hating on a nigga
Dat is a weak emotion, da lady of a nigga
And you can tipped like ya waitin on a nigga
Putta body bag and a apron on a nigga…
I give my all behind da mic
But you could never see if you sit behind da light
And you don’t have to pick me to win da title fight
But I’mma wear dat champion belt sooo tight
And if I’m wrong there is no right
And if I’m wrong there is snow white
I’m tryna be po-lite but you bitches in my hair
Like da fucking po-lice And my flow is rare
These other rappers nice, these other rappers bark
Some of ‘em even bite
But I’m much more bright I give the game sight
But before you dim the lights you just might, might, wanna

Think it over, think it over (Oooooo)
Think it over, think it over (Baby, baby)
[Lil Wayne
Verse 2]
Stop… analyzin’ critacizin’
You should realize what I am and start epitomizin’
Legitimate, I got the heart of the biggest lion
I’m confident like fuck em all pull out my dick and ride it
My flow sick, so sick, it’s like my shit is dyin’
It rains a lot in my city, cause my city’s cryin’
Because my city’s dyin’
Still I emerge from all of that I am a living pion-eer, near Zion
Fear God, not them
Steer my Robin Coupe through the streets of the boot… and
Soo-woo
And, then I leave blood in the booth, I leave a blood bath
Sorry there’s a tub in the booth, now where the drugs at?
I’m twisted like the string on a shoe
No nigga fuck dat
I’m twisted like the string on a boot, now where New Orleans at?
I feel hip hop stole me like a bus pass
So in your possession, I, I, I must ask…

Hey, haven’t I been good to you? (Think it over)
Tell me; haven’t I been sweet to you?

Drag my name through the mud
I come out clean
Cast away stones
I won’t even blink
A gun is not a math problem
I won’t even think
Just leave you dead like the mink under my sink
Don’t believe in me
Don’t believe me
I graduated from hungry
And made it to greedy
My flow is like pasta
Take it and eat it
But I’m gone need cheese if I’m bakin’ lasini
You niggas want beef?
I want a steak and uh, we be
Lost in Amsterdam or Jamaica where we be
Hard body nigga, just taken it easy
All about my paper, bout my paper like Easy
Why do rappers Why to rappers, lie to fans
Lie to rappers, a lot rappers lie like actors cut the mothafuckin camera
Cut the checks nigga fuck your props

James and the giant peach,UnKnown,UnKnown,"My names is James and I am a little boy
Who used to have fun and lots of joy
Then my parents were eaten and died
I was lonely and wanted to hide
I had to live with two aunts, that was old and mean
I didn’t know, “Better days was going to be seen”
I felt sad and I ran away
That was the beginning of a better day
I met an old man that gave me a gift
It was going to make my life great and swift
Running home fast as I could
Not as careful as I should
The gift of green things came pouring out
I knew they was gone without a shadow of a doubt
They were absorbed in the ground
I was sad and didn’t make a sound
Before our eyes, a peach began to grow
All my aunts could think about was making some doe
People paid to see the peach
It was fenced out of everyone’s reach
I could not come out or get fed
I had to stay inside on my bed
I was made to go outside to clean
It was amazing what my eyes seen
The peach was big as a house
I was amazed and quiet as a mouse
To my surprise there was a hole
I was curious so I became bold
I touched the peach and crawled inside
Not knowing I would be going for a ride
Inside were lots of life size bugs
And i thought who are these mugs
All of them knew my name
And I thought what a crazy sick game
They started laughing and talking to me
Oh my God, a better life was going to be
They were friendly and kind
They are going to be friends of mine
No more sadness and tears
I was going to have some happy years
As the peach began to rock and roll
I knew a story would be told",https://genius.com/Lil-wayne-james-and-the-giant-peach-lyrics

Take a knee and thank the Man then get back to the money

Where ya goin'? I gotta get back to the money
You ain't know I gotta go
Where ya goin'? I gotta get back to the money
To the money

Nigga I ain't got a money printer
So for this paper chase I'm out runnin' sprinters
Yes the last two Cash Money members
Shout out to the new Cash Money members
Baby and Slim still point guard and center
So much money on my mind it's all I remember
And I just bought a gun wit' a extender
And that bitch hold me up like suspenders
Cut like a blender sharper than a bitch
They got so many pussy niggas I can make a list
Niggas wonder why I stress that I am the best
'Cause even bobble heads tell me yes.. haha
Put it on the hood I'm Hollygrove to death
I'm already good I'm workin' on my left
A jungle on my wrist a circus on my neck
Don't forget the Baby no don't forget the F

This is a Scott Storch and I'm a hot torch
And gettin' money is my sport
And understand the rap game is my court
So I shall walk and come forth like a Rockport
Or some sort of... matchin' slippers or yacht shoes
See I don't cruise control I control the cruise
Yes... I gets throat on a boat
And I vow to never fall like soap on a rope and
(Chorus 1 - Lil Wayne)
I got a lot of loot and I ain't lookin' for a lady
And you can never pay me I'm from Uptown baby
I wake up in the mornin' take a piss and wash my hands
Take a knee and thank the Man then get back to the money
You ain't know I gotta go
Where ya goin'? I gotta get back to the money
You ain't know I gotta go
Where ya goin'? I gotta get back to the money
To the money
(Verse 3 - Birdman)
Fresh wit' the hustle so we bounce back on them suckers
Blowin' big doin' gigs got it ran in hundreds
They reppin' layin' here we stuntin'
On the grind all the time homie gettin' money
3rd Ward soldier 13th gangsta
17th hustler known top ranker
Money go getter them clowns can't figure
Poppin' at the mouth like this cutter won't split 'em
Know how to survive hustlin' stayin' fly
My whole hood cried when my lil' brother died
Know I had to ride never let it slide
It's just the G in me and I'ma get it til I die daddy
(Chorus 2 - Lil Wayne - 2X)
You ain't know I gotta go
Where ya goin'? I gotta get back to the money
You ain't know I gotta go
Where ya goin'? I gotta get back to the money
To the money

Like some butter on a motherfucking bagel
Like tomatoes, a egg yolk
I walk it like I talk it with a sore throat and my legs broke
I go hard like I'm dead broke
I'm fed up and my head hurt
This choppa in my pants leg got me limping harder than Fred Durst
You ain't doing shit, I've said worse
Dirty south, that red dirt
I ain't doing shit without getting bread first
And you ain't leaving until I wear it first
I put the choppa in your mouth watch your head burst
Ooh lil mama with the hand work
And she suck a nigga dick until my leg jerk
Then she swallow all that shit, then burp
Then she swallow all that shit, then burp
She ask me to fuck her friend first
I said ""why not?"", I said ""yeah sure""
Because her boyfriend be getting on her last nerve
Pussy ass nigga need a pap smear

Cook it up, chop it up, racks served
Cook it up, chop it up, racks served

Only come outside just to make more
Same clothes, anything goes
When I'm in cake mode
Take more
Lord I'm in chase mode
Same clothes
Watching for them police in them plain clothes
We don't break code, we break your face and hoes'
We got that base, that blow
You fuck with basic hoes

I ain't into backing up, but just in case I'm backing out
Now look how she reactin', now I put it in, she asking ow

When my main ho act like a pee hole
And that feel, that's Sub-Zero
I say one time for that bitch who just want dick and summin' to eat
Only want a number three, that's my pussy custody
I want a slim fine woman with some twerk with her
She ain't got no nosy friends, just a purse with her
She ain't got a lot of ass but I can work with her
Nigga, that's my cup of tea, ha, burnt my tongue
Oooh, she got a popcorn booty
Verytime I see that ass it make me wanna watch a movie
It's supposed to be a lot of hard working going on
But who the fuck can focus with all this twerkin going on?
Say what the fuck going on, man it must be twerk season
Something in the air, it must be twerk season
Cuz they dancin', dancin', for no reason
Man they dancin', dancin', dancing for no reason

I'm like I'm fuckin her right now

Got ya bitch tip-toein' on my marble floors
Red bottoms only for the centerfolds
Big bodies I got 10 of those
Whippin' work it smelling like they dinner rolls
Told that bitch take your shoes off, look don't even argue
Got your bitch tip-toeing on Italian marble
They on that bad batch, too much pork around it
Shorty ass fat you gotta walk around it
Big body got ten of those
Cars, cribs that's eight hoes
Nine piece that's dinner rolls
Wild freaks, that centrefold
Hundred on my shine
You don't like it fine
Got ya bitch tip-toeing like Gregory Hines
Cashing out with that nina
Ten days you ain't seen her
She ask for it, I beat her
You greedy nigga you eat it
These ? niggas all on my dick
Princess cuts all in my wrist
Hundred rounds all in my hip
200 grand all in my whip

Shoot you in ya head like Abraham Lincoln
Stuntin' on them bitches like Birdman
Roll the weed in white sheets, Ku Klux Klan
Put it on the scale, watch it do numbers
Playing with them keys like Stevie Wonder
All my hoes pretty, all my niggas brazy

Call me Tunechi Lee or don't call me at all
Man fuck all you niggas, pause

2 Chainz, that's your best answer
Cup filled with pink, I'm supporting breast cancer
I might do that walk for the 5k
I get paid every time I leave my driveway
Got yo girl tip-toeing on my marble floors
Sitting by the pool, jumping off the diving board
Getting to the money I'mma need a money counter
So many acres, my neighbours stay in another county
Ted Dibiase in Versace loafers
All you talk is shit nigga halitosis

We get money and we smoke like candles
When we do it I let her keep on her sandals

Ghetto Rich,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Shit, we tryna get it for real
Oh, Rich Boy, you niggas better get focused
Get money, muthafucka, get money, muthafucka
Let me take ya through my hood where I was born and raised
Where niggas tote semi-automatics, bustin' them K's
Heavy guns and dope boys harassed by the police
Still gettin' pulled over and asked by the police
'Bama wasn't made for a nigga to win
See the color of ya skin get 'cha put in the pen
It's real life, over dice, Dwayne dead and gone
Sendin' niggas to the pen or the funeral home
I be feelin' like the Lord'll never answer me back
So I'm holdin' on my gat just in case they attack
Bullet holes in ya house'll make it hard to sleep
Ya see the fiends on the street want the hard for cheap
'Lotta niggas doin' life from under covers and fake friends
It's real how them penitentiary bars'll break men
Niggas doin' life from under covers and fake friends
It's real how them penitentiary bars'll break men
It's where you live, it's where you play
It's where you learn your favorite slang
Your world is ghetto
It's where I live, it's where I'm from
It's where you had to tote your gun
Your world is ghetto
Can't explain how I feel growin' up in the gutter
Told my mama that I love her put nobody above her
Doin' crimes, a hard time for food on the plate
Know a couple of niggas ain't never comin' out the gate
Movin' weight the only thing them street niggas know
Servin' thangs at school, they never teach 'em, don't show
But a 44'll get 'cha money fast from robbin'
Do or die situation when ya tired, be stavin'
Government'd never send me a dime for school
So I went and started workin' like my nine my tool
I'm a leader for the South, pa, open ya ears
Young kids where I'm from wear permanent tears
It's where you live, it's where you play
It's where you learn your favorite slang
Your world is ghetto
It's where I live, it's where I'm from
It's where you had to tote your gun
Your world is ghetto
I'm a product of the block, watch the fiends come back
Got a couple white packs 'cause they fiend for that
Early five in the mornin', pigs showin' they badge
Real niggas in the street still showin' they rags
Speed bumps in the road start slowin' me down
See them fake niggas actin' like they know me now
Got a chance to advance, so I'm makin' my move
Couple o' people still thinkin' they got somethin' to prove
Pay the card for the South, yeah the hood my home
Told my mama I'ma leave the dope game alone
On my knees every night conversatin' wit God
Niggas dyin' everyday 'cause they wanna be hard
Still totin' my piece 'cause it ain't nothin' like the movies
I'm wearin' my vest in case they hit me wit the Uzi
Even if I take a trip around the world and back
I'm representin' for the hoods where they feel me at
It's where you live, it's where you play
It's where you learn your favorite slang
Your world is ghetto
It's where I live, it's where I'm from
It's where you had to tote your gun
Your world is ghetto, your world, ghetto
Throw 'em up if you know what the hood like
Throw 'em up if you lookin' for that good life
Throw 'em up if ya ghetto, shit
Your world, ghetto",https://genius.com/Lil-wayne-ghetto-rich-lyrics

Lost in a fairytale
Can you hold my hands and be my guide
Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
And I hope it rains
You're the perfect lullaby
What kinda dream is this

You could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I, don't wanna wake up from you
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your loves to good to be true
My guilty pleasure I ain't going no where
Baby long as you're here
I'll be floating on air cause you're my

Bike here, throw it up, no high chair
Cold like a white bear

And I'm rich I could buy you
Kill bitches leave ya body in a bayou

More head than a dread
And my bank account ain't hardly empty
So I come through in a Barbie Bentley
But please mamacita, please no envy
When you come around it reads no entry
Who's next to go

Get gassed get at me, Texaco
Shoot yourself in the leg, plexico

Put the Desi to his chest
Homey going die tonight
Then his jaw dropped like Napoleon dynamite
Jack boy I been since I'm a toddler
My Dad was sleeping I was running through his pockets
Oh yeah you ready for war then what's stopping you
I hope you know them Bentley doors not chopper proof
And they go Br are-RR Ta Tat
Just like them bullets dancin'
Come up short wit my doe I'm bout to pull a Manson
Take your kids for ransom
Yeah it's Payback Nigga
Next time I front you some birds you better pay Crack
What shit, I don't know nothing
He might be the police coming up with assumptions
All I know is this nigga hear is about to meet god
If you don't bring me some keys or bring me fifty large",https://genius.com/Lil-wayne-profit-lyrics
No worri,UnKnown,UnKnown,"You can look me in my face (I ain't got no worries)x3
See the sh-rooms keep me up (I ain't got no worries)x3
You see money right there, yeah that's Tunechi right there (turn up)
Yeah that's Mack Maine right there, and we ain't got no worries
You see pussy right there redbone mangos right there
See them sh-roomies right there we ain't got no worries

Tunechi in this bitch, errybody should be worried
Them pussy niggas be purring, bitches be diggin' me I feel buried
And if she make this dick hard, she woke up a sleeping giant
Man your bitch speak in tongues every time we speak in private
Hope your barber shop open cause we got hair triggers
Smoke so much that Smokey the Bear’ll have to bear with us
And that Jeep with the doors off that means that bitch sleep
All these bitches think they’re the shit, I’ll send them up shit’s creek
You see Tunechi right here, give me brain ideas
It's ok if you turn up just don't turn off my light years
All I know is I do it what I'm smoking I grew it
B’s up, Blood Gang; Piru it, and all rats gotta die even Stuart
On my private jet and my stewardess is your bitch nigga, bitch Nigga
I know gold-diggers and ditch-diggers
You don't get dissed, you get disfigured
She say sorry I didn't shave so that pussy a little furry
I put that pussy in my face: I ain't got no worries
Tunechi


We ain't got no worries
She bad as a hooker, so she ain't got no worries
She want me to eat her sugar, I say ""Why you in a hurry?""
She say ""Why you asking questions?"" I say ""Bitch you trynna be funny!""
Now take your fucking clothes off, let me see that Donkey Kong
I swing your ass back and forth, back and forth on my monkey bar
That camel toe that camel toe, no worries no panty-hose
These niggas falling off like baggy clothes, I smoke more than a magic show
I swear I saw my ho, I swear she was with my ho
You know I fuck them both, sore pussy and sore throat

Life in the fast-lane, little red corvette
Little red handkerchief, hangin out the right side
Back pocket jeans fallin, Couple my evisu signed
Yep we do shine, and they gon hate
But they hated Jesus baby we won't break
So we ride like 4 Pirellis
So secured no security, no protectin no comparing

Thats a somersault back spin full flip for ya?
Push this button, I flip out and hit something
Miss nothin i'm just bustin until this scene clean
12 hundred for the jeans stop playin
Hundred dollars for the Glock in my pants
Who the man? I am when I stand with it pointed right at ya face
Knock the brains from the back of ya neck for lack of respect
I- strap a jet black gat til the deck
Tell the mama to bury me with that, No Bullshittin
My hood getting kinda crazy where I be
So Ronie's with me 'cause he's the OG

Fresh out the back seat of the figgity phantom
The haters I make em mad em when I wave at em like what up?!
If it ain't about money I keep goin
I tryna get that green, niggas tryna mow my lawn
But Fuck, them boys I got the shottie on my arm
If them boys run up I leave their bodies on the lawn
And Duck the fuck out a there, 'cause baby its hot out there
If this was a movie its time to roll the credits, cut!
Its all over, all of ya brains is all over the motherfuckin block!

And this one right here is for that ghetto girl with the bad perm
That just burn baby, burn baby, burn
Pop open a malt liquor
Smoke something until your scalp gets killed

Gangstas and pimps
Love lobsters and shrimps
Kool-Aid and chicken
Flashy things and women
All I need
Is Remy and weed
Somebody not afraid
To go some for my Escalade

I'm just pimping
Baby you got a rule for me
Put your mink on and slide in a cool for me
Hey you gotta get high and go low for me
It's Cash Money young money never know money
It's 500 Degreez it's not fool
But it and the dro got me so scummy
And to drum hole a whole hundred
Can I put a whole hundred in your whole tummy
Hehe, man Weezy's a legend
You can tell by the bottom of my sleeve when you see what's in a bezel
And he be on a level that's so terrific
I'm in this bitch hold your pictures
And hold your bitches cuz she gon want a part of me
Cuz she never see the roof of my car with me
And you never see a tooth without a diamond on it
This is game at its finest homie
Peep it


See I was born from a gangsta
Pa gave me a whip
Ran numbers with pimps and I laid down cents
One of a kind Birdman I shine
22's on it?

I gave it all to her

Flash from hard times from that coke and dope
Put cars in moms name just to duck white folks
We eat lobster and shrimp

Pop bottles of Mo

Ain't no mountain high enough

Bleed for ya I'm the heart of New Orleans
Hear you're fucking with a gangsta foe
Hope you never close your eyes I'll bang your ho
All she need is some guidance I'll tame your ho

Part of my anger is I'm caught ina tangle
Like we know each other
Roots in the graden of strangers
She make my heart feel tha strangest
But I like it, I love it
I'm tryin to make something of it
She make me feel better than tha best rapper
I'm a need a best man an your best pastor",https://genius.com/Lil-wayne-like-this-lyrics

Why Stop Now,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Every single time I get up in the building
Then I touch it, and I get it poppin'
You can never stop it
And how long it got 'em hung in
And they're wonderin'
On how my nigga does it
When I'm blackin' every hood and every street and then I flood it
Makin' every dj wanna bring it back and they robbin
Makin other niggas starve n ain't no food up in the cupboard
See the way I got 'em spittin'
Now I gotta nigga runnin
From the way that I be gettin' on the beat and I'll be
Dumbin' (i'll be dumbin')
Lemme gibble in
And a dabble with the flow
Lemme show you niggas
How I really mix it up
Im a slow it down a little
Naw think ya betta meta flip it up
(kill 'em!)
Switch it up
I'll probly pitch it up
Dont wanna see ya
Bottles in ya hands
Nigga get it up (ho!)
Throw my money all around
Until it hit the ground
I'ma makes shorty work before she pick it up (whoo!)
You know the shit was kinda dead '
Fore I had to
Step up all up in the spot
And really lift it up (damn!)
And soon I busta nigga head in
And then I throw a little coke up shoot until they sniff it up
And see they know'
When I come
I hit it up
I kill it '
Til a nigga 'body get the stiffin' up
Ya need to betta know
That I can do anything that I want
Niggas already be knowin'
I'm a give it up!
All right, I'm a let you niggas calm down for a minute and get your shit together!
Here's what I need y'all to do!
Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap
Let's go!
Ok, come around
See me put it down just a little bit
Ball and I'm heavy
Y'all already know exactly what to do
Somebody better get the crown when the nigga spit hurry!
Make sure you polish it a little 'fore you bring it to me
While I get it down with another hit (you're ready)
And you ain't even gotta ask
When you already know another bang is what you gonna get!
Yeah! better bounce when a nigga say so its like magic
When the nigga spit pressed out
And if you're really with me, and you're ready, let's go!
Rhyme with a nigga
Like we're on a metro
Y'all already know
I kill anyone
Anywhere, anything
From the very intro
And I beat the most
Everything
And you shoulda
Knew that form the very get go!
Just watch 'em close
See how they bug
On how the god delivers
Now we're blacking in this bitch
Until the police come and get us!
Watch so you could see! (the conglomorate)
Who fucking with us?
I could shit and fart all on the beat and kill a couple niggers! oh, oh!
Everybody know what the fuck it is -true!
And then I think I'm a beat
Them in the heads
Niggers know I do it till I split a couple of wigs
And you know that when I got him
And I hit him from the bottom
You don't want a nigga really though!
And I'll be doing anything that I want
It don't matter where we're at, I'm a let it go!
Yeah! we can do anything
Walk into anywhere and buy anything!
I'll be chilling, I don't worry about anything

He a G,Lil Weezy Ana,2006,"My swag is in order, nigga, immage is a must
Six didgits on the car, nigga, that's a plus
Six hundred for the jeans, I neverr pull my pants up
Already there, why you tryna get your grams up
I put your hoe in handcuffs, I take her hostage
I see you walkin round, short arms, deep pockets
I live to see a profit, you down to break even
I'm really in the clear, you niggas stay leakin
You niggas just ain't eatin
Pick another lane
Rap game, crack game, you should pick another game
I'm headed for the jeweler, bout to pick another chain
Then I go to the pad, bout to stick another dame

I rock, I roll
I'm fly, I know
You broke, you mad
Turn your swag, turn it up
Turn it up, turn it up

See I'm a rock and roll all-star, a hip hop ledgend
I eat the track up, now where is my bevrage
I belch bars, excuse my presents
And I charge for every letter, like a fuckin text message
Chroam on, shades on, game on
And my V-Neck is pushed like Mason
You can't fuck with me, man
You're like Weak Man to me, man
What up, blood
What up, blood
What up, gangsta
Belt game banging, chain game slanging
Weezy F Baby, the shit still stankin

I rock, I roll

You broke, you mad
Turn your swag, turn it up
Turn it up, turn it up

Fat boy go hard, you not like I
You dope man fresh, I'm kingpin fly
My team on point, my swag on ten
My doe don't fold, my cash don't bend
My doors go up, my sounds up loud
You are nothing, but another face in the croud
Corner store John Doe, lookin for a name
The shit you provide me, is nothing to the game
I'm the leader of the pack, you can tell by the talk
I'm a bonified star, you can tell by the walk
One hand on my nuts, the other on a stack
You lookin for doe, I can show you where it's at

I rock, I roll
I'm fly, I know
You broke, you mad

Tha life of Dizzy a true story give me 2 thumbs up
I runs up slanted grill wit 2 guns up
Slangin bullets like 2 nun chucks

Get a grip niggas, don't trip niggas
I dun turned gangstas ta bitch niggas
My name ringin like a dead singer
Tha head banger, givin hatas tha mid finga

Ya kno it wouldn't be right wit out tha boy
Let me speak on it...
Keep heat underneath tha seats up in tha jeep
Wit tha feet chrome it no retreat when tha beef on me
I'm to deep in tha streets homie
Put tha trees and tha leaves for me
And tha leaves to relieve on me
No seed just proceed to blow weed and mo weed
So high I dat I got a nose bleed

Nuttin but G's up in here and I swear I returned one wit tha most pos wit tha crow team
So I get more cream
Long ride in tha hoes spleen
Got a hoe on tha floor givin me a blow job and its so mean
And if I told you who you'd be so confused
But don't mind gatta whole week
Don't mind I'm a hoe king
One line make a hoe dream
One time make a hoe drink
Get her to tha crib make tha hoe eat
Then make tha bitch fuck tha whole street
Dude rich but he's so street
Fuck a bitch yea I'm O.B

Run from tha dude cuz he will clap quicker than a mutha fucker
He may be a rap nigga but tha boy gutta

How on Earth do the jeans conceal that?
I gotta get a clearer view, she working in the mirror boo
Drop it to the floor, shake that body like Shakira do
Other women copy, I knew 'em 'cause you imitate them
Try to get a player right, jiggle with that cellulite
Shortie look surprised because I'm part of the who's who
Or maybe wanna choose you, a kinda girl I'm used to
Face like Nia Long, skin Tov Lo, yeah
Body like the 'licious, money like Oprah

Knock me up when we alone, make my black slave known

She be raking in the cash, take it in the ass
Janet and Janine, now take it in the jaw
Nobody like to fuck 'em 'cause they like to take the balls
And it's blowjob Kate, her head game's great
Her tongue run on me, like the bitch vibrate

Nightmares of the Bottom (My Version),UnKnown,UnKnown,"Sleepin' at the top, nightmares of the bottom
Everybody wanna be fly til you swat 'em
But who am I to talk? I ain't shittin' roses
We in the same picture but we all got different poses
Now I'm looking in my rear view, I see the world in it
I try to slow down, and I get rear ended
Pause! Like a red light, I'm dead right!
Highway to Heaven, God do you see my headlights?
They say ""you don't know what you're doing till you stop doing it""
Well call me clueless cause I do this
Attention all shooters, I'm a shooting star
Life is a course and I'm a shoot for Par
I'm searching for today instead I found tomorrow
And I put that shit right back man I'll see what I find tomorrow
Young Money CMR, blood like a scar
Weezy F baby and the F ain't for ""Flaw""
(Uh)
(Uh)
(Yup, yup, yup, yup)
It's like I have it all
But I don't have to worry
Married to the money, a true love story
Only God can judge me, I don't need a jury
Nothing standing in my way, like nothings my security
Back to my journey, that bullshit don't concern me
If I knew I was going to jail I would have fucked my attorney
If you sleeping on me nigga, than I hope you toss and turning
I'm so cold I'm hypothermic, ask yo bitch she will confirm it, yeah
Now what we doing with it
Keep opening ya grill, I'm barbecuing with it
I know my shit already tight so I ain't screwing with it
Some say this game is a joke well I hope they get it
OK, I'm walking on needles, sticking to the point
Yeah the streets is talking, I'm familiar with the voice
I'm a gangsta by choice I hope my son's choose wiser
And don't call me sir, call me survivor
(Uh)
(Yeah)
(Uh)
(And they go yup, yup, yup, yup)
(Uh)
Call me killer 'cause I make a killing
I got this shit wrapped up, bow and a ribbon
That's them twin Glocks, you can call 'em siblings
And them bullets travel, better hope I keep dribbling
I touch the sky, get the clouds out my fingernails
These bitches think they fly like Tinkerbell
But they all on my wire like Stringer Bell
I let 'em be, 'cause you know how that stinger feel
Know how to whip that white girl, I can spank her tail
And I fuck up any track; train derail
Know how to roll, never need training wheels
And when the truth hurts, I pop pain pills
Uh, all or nothing, or nothing else
I bleed reality, I should cut myself
Just had a bowl of riches and a cup of wealth
And the ""F"" is for fuck yourself
(Uh)
(Yeah)
And I ain't doing nothin' but getting my share
Breathin' this air
And Mack's mom told me she gonna keep me in her prayers
So I'm feeling alright I'm tryna stay aware
And if you wanna trip than I'm a meet ya there
To my niggas in the game, keep the game fair
Players play, coaches coach and cheerleaders cheer
I'm tryna keep spirit when the ghost disappear

Fall the fuck back like a bike with no kickstand
Get out my mix, man, just gon' get you stuck deep in the quicksand
With no easy fix, man
No Trix man, those is for kids
Kush in my cigar, and hoes in the crib
Drank, and the 20 ounce froze in the fridge
You fuckin' with DA so you know what it is
I'm sittin' on the fours that clack
Comin' down candy in a golden 'Lac
We gettin' to the money like it's Goldman Sachs
And we do it for the pimps that hold 'em back, let's go

L-l-look who crept in with automatic weapons
Reppin' QB till the death of him
That nigga that aspired lyrical tyrants
Like Kanye West and Em

Smack adolescents who ask who the best is
I'm nasty like gas from a fat man attested
I pass it, you gaspin' for breath and you die fast
But I'm like a gastric bypass
Bunch of Nas African actors seemed to get typecast in the same role
Since 16 I ain't grow a day old, yet my brain grow
Cocaine white Range Rov
Tats on my body like an art exhibit, I did real good for a project, nigga
Was once a Bacardi sipper, now it's Chandon
Fat blunts in the car with strippers
Guns in compartments hidden, I was real young, little youth
A novice nigga
Blessings, bowed down, respected
Chowed down, now my food's digested
Pow-pow, with my shooters are Techs
Bust louder than the noise I just spit
Let's get one thing straight, that my crown ain't for testin', testin'
Chop heads off like King Henry the 8th, guillotine to your neck, bitch
I'm a king in this thing, don't be dumb
Been in this shit since '91
Niggas can't fuck with the style I use
Your fate is sealed, no Heidi Klum
Calm now, was a wylin' dude
Studied cowards that made power moves
Watched Wild Planet, seen lions devour food, you can say that's how I move
A monster nigga, and I don't really like doing songs with niggas
There go my nigga Wayne, let them niggas hate
I love my nigga Drake say ""We ain't got time to respond to niggas""

But he never knew, niggas be cheese, just like us

Cut like a blender, chopper like the feegy
They got so many pussy nigggas, they starting to police me
I don't give a fuck, if you be in the cut
With the choppers, so dap m up, eat m for lunch
Shootin out the window saying Young Money, motherfucker

Skinny nigga, fat pockets
Shoot you in the back, just to get your back poppin
What you know about fat profit
Cause I got that bitch, in my back poket
Went straight to the grove, skipped college
Yeah, you know, me and Mack, had them streets poppin
Stylin on you, I unload this volume on you
Young B, with 2 gloccs
Make a nigga see double off, one shot
Rocks in my chain, like Barney Rubble
This ain't an axadent, I was born to hustle

Cut like a blender, chopper like the feegy
They got so many pussy nigggas, they starting to police me

So if they ever thought the South and the North was gonna collide
That's what they thinking!
Guess what?We already did

Go!

I'm feeling like a Black Republican, naw, I can't call it
More like a Black Democrat runnin' 'em out of office (Get out)
Young Barack-a Obama, I'm all for it
The Rock of Gibraltar has now fallen on you
I protect my land like a farmer
Pockets stay chubby like Toccara (Yup), huh
Or should I say fat like the Parkers
Tote big guns like I'm still playing

It's get rich, go to jail, or be a murder victim
Ayy! Now all y'all listen
If you can't take the heat, get out the kitchen

I feel like a Black Republican, tote the MAC in the public
AndAct so southern n' die for my brethren
Money, money-money, like Money Mackin' Publishing
One life to live, never ask for a mulligan
Streets cold but the heat make me feel covenant
Been had cake, you late like Ed Sullivan
Fly like an eagle, but no, I'm not Donovan
Boy, you better go eat some soup with your mama 'nem
And my mind is on another continent
I am real Cash Money, no counterfeit
I don't parking-lot pimp, I just politick
But I get all in her mouth like Polident
New Orleans representer to the inner
Come from the city where the glitter don't glimmer
The sun don't shine, and the guns don't sleep
Wake a nigga ass up like he got somewhere to be

I feel like a black Republican, drug money comin' in
I'm a volcano filled with lava 'bout to erupt again (Ehh)
I stay with the iron, don’t make me plug it in (Nope)
Stay outta rich kids' business, don’t be butting in (Ahh)
Stay with a chick that's ready to unbutton it
Forget a tongue, she put a lung on it (Ha), ha
My Listerine come out, she start guzzling (Gaaa)
I’m above you dudes, I’m hovering (Ffff)
""Juelz, why you ducking them?"" Duckin' who? (Who?)
I’m in the hood like, “What it do?"", comfortable

Second class, rich nobles
Third class, everyone else

""We don't want to pay taxes
We want a better social status""
Lets change us, let's change the system

Only way to get things done
But maybe things have to come to an end
People are tired, and they don't wanna play pretend
Lets start a Revolution
Revolution, Revolution
It's the French Revolution

The only way to end this era is to kill King Louis
He's got to go
The whole country in debt
No more living like this
They chopped his head
Happy he was dead
It's over, new beginning

It's the Old Regime everyone

This Is The Way We Sqad,SQ5,UnKnown,"I'm Weezy Baby, back on tha scene, underground king
Pimp C and Bun, you my fathers im your son
Group on 21s, barkin' up tha ride
But really I ain't trippin' I jus' like ta be high
Nigga we SQAD, we real, we pure
Baby blue ferrari of tha Nellyville tour
And we could all eat til our belly get full
If not we show our teeth and Mack 11's get pull
But that's another story, lets get back ta this thang
Righ na me and Fi negotiating buy tha Saints
We might buy tha Rams, we might buy tha Hornets
It's scary boy young money cause all them bitches garbage
Your beef it better squash it caise right na we jus' marching
If ya ain't in tha band on expand it cost a margin
My hands is often frosty cause tha band on tha corner fifty grand on my fortress

This is the way we SQAD
And we like ta floss
Weezy is tha boss
I represent that dirty dirty dirty dirty Souf
And we ridin' chops
Tha ones that never stop
Tha Young Money boys and we SQAD this shit out

It's Gutta Gutta
Streets representer
Big Benz whiper
I like Lion Hearts but I rather ride spinners
I'm smokin' on that killa, I'm higha than a bitch
We signed ta Cash Money, Young Money got rich
Now you see we ball, now you see tha SQAD
We pullin' up in 10 different color bubble cars
I'm on a world tour and don't gotta album
It dont make sense but i make a lotta cabbage
I'm tryna get rich
I'm tryna get paid
I rip tha damn show and get head backstage
I'm livin' in tha range, like I'm in a cage
I pull that thang out and send a couple ta yo brains
I don't like tha cops man mothafuckin' Feds
I represent Sqad Up til I'm muthafuckin' dead

The Ballad of the Human,i’m off topic,UnKnown,"Take some clay and a little dirt
Mold it up give it shape
Breathe in life, make it hurt
Show it love, let it escape

The day he escaped was the day he died
In the sun shined rays of thought
The day he died wouldn’t be the last time
But when he ran was when he was caught
Have you seen the inside of love?
I’ve only asked this question once before
Have you lived in the world up above?
Everyday I speak as I’m ignored

Take some clay and a little dirt
Mold it up, help it stand
Breathe in life, make it learn
Never reach out to take its hand

The day she found him was the day she died
A world is never clear with intentions
The day she died she gained her pride
Her decision marks her incomprehension
Who do you think of right away?
I heard someone close is gone
If I haven’t thought of them once everyday
To the creation is where I have withdrawn

Take some dirt and a little clay
Serve its purpose, mold it up
Breathe in life, watch it decay
Let me love and corrupt",https://genius.com/Lil-wayne-the-ballad-of-the-human-lyrics
Tell Me You Need Me,The Drought is Over 3: Who is the Predator,UnKnown,"I'm holdin' on a rope Got me ten feet off the ground And I'm hearin' what you're saying But I just can't make a sound You tell me that you need me Then
You go and cut me down, but wait Tell me that you're sorry Didn't think I'd turn around, I say hey

Okay, I'm talking 'bout a good girl gone bad
Crooked world, wrong path; right Mom, wrong Dad
I sing this song mad but not mad enough to shoot you
But it just eats me up, like some barbecue from Luther's
In the morning with the roosters
On the corner with the boosters
And she's the fresh-cut and they're on her, like sutures
And I wanna talk to her, but her momma has to school her
I wanna see her better, she's the weather of my future
I don't wanna see another hurricane
Baby, you can kill the pain
If you just let me explain, trust me, I know what I'm sayin'
You will end up on the track of an on-comin' train
Stuck in the passenger seat, travelin' through the fast lane

Well, once upon a time there was a mom and a dad
Who on the outside, had everything people wished they had
A beautiful daughter, two-story house, two-car garage
And a white picket-fence wrapped around the front yard
See, Daddy was a doctor and Mommy was a banker
Mommy's job got outsourced, so now Mommy's a dranker
Daddy had a malpractice suit, now he's a snorter
And all this shit is takin' place right in front of the daughter
She says, ""Daddy, what's wrong?"", but he's just too high
""Mommy, what we gon' do?"", she just get drunk and cry
Caught in the middle of two wrongs, tryin' to do right
Looking for answers all alone in the darkness of night
Shit ain't right

I'm holding on a rope
Got me ten feet off the ground
And I'm hearing what you're saying
But I just can't make a sound
You tell me that you need me
Then you go and cut me down, but wait
Tell me that you're sorry
Didn't think I'd turn around, I say hey

You say that it's too late to apologize
It's too late
I said it's too late to apologize
It's too late",https://genius.com/Lil-wayne-tell-me-you-need-me-lyrics

I'm far from bein' the bastard that Marcy had fathered
Now my name's been mentioned with the martyrs
The Biggies and the Pacs and the Marleys and the Marcuses
Garvey; got me a molotov-cocktail flow
Even if you box well, can't stop the blows
Kaboom! The Roc Boy in the room
The dope boy I just came off the spoon
Also, I'm so fly I'm on auto-

I see Euros, that's right: plural
I took so much change from this rap game, it's your go
(Hey Mr. Carter) Young!

It's my go, yeah… And I'ma go so opposite-of-soft
Off the richter, Hector, Camacho Man, Randy Savage
Far from average, above status–quo, flow so pro
I know, I ride slow, and when I pass
They say, ""What up, killa?"" Man, stop bringin' up my past
And next time you mention Pac, Biggie, or Jay-Z

Los Angeles Girls,UnKnown,UnKnown,"{Pre-Chorus}
(Los Angeles girls, Los Angeles girls
I ever need you, and you be on my brain
Yeah)
{Chorus}
Los Angeles girls , They be trapping in my hood
They be going for my wood, And they made me understood
That these girls are all lying, And they love it when your dying
Keep you talkin till you tryin, When your close they leave you crying (Its all fake tho)
Why she coming on so slow? Why she dont wanna go?
Hanging with the rest I’m like a ghost
I go insane, She in my brain
She must be tamed, it ain’t my job, but I’m in love
And that’s a curse and it hurts
They say it’s better for the worst
I am around her she gone flirt
My money be going down
Give it all to her she proud
Think she got me feeling sound
Now the people make you think that the money is insane
And it keeps you in your lane, and it makes you start to gain
But once the racks started coming in i felt the same
That i was empty all inside (all inside)
And I put the Wraith in park and ran right up the stairs
Got inside the studio and started diggin in my hair
Tryna find the best lines to make all of this be fair
Yeah I’m pretty fortunate but the victories ain’t there
I wanna live right now
And I’m tired of the pain, they be hittin me right now
She down to hang right now
Right after i glowed up and the $’s comin in right now
And now I’m flying
I see you lying
Don’t mess with me not more
Please no
