Why?,The Champ Is Here,2004.0,"Yo, why is Jadakiss as hard as it gets?
Why is the industry designed to keep the artist in debt?
And why them dudes ain't ridin' if they part of your set?
And why they never get it poppin' but they party to death?
Yeah, and why they gonna give you life for a murder?
Turn around, only give you eight months for a burner?
It's goin' down;
 why they sellin' niggas' CD's for under a dime?
And if it's all love, daddy, why you come with your 9?
Why my niggas ain't get that cake?
Why is a brother up north better than Jordan
That ain't get that break?
Why you don't stack instead of tryin' to be fly?
Why is rattin' at an all time high? Why are you even alive?
Why they kill 2Pac and Chris?
Why at the bar you ain't take straight shots instead of poppin' Cris?
Why them bullets have to hit that door?
Why did Kobe have to hit that raw? Why'd he kiss that whore?
Why?!

All that I’ve been given
It's this pain that I’ve been livin'
They got me in the system
Why they gotta do me like that?
Tried to make it my way
But got sent on up the highway
Why? Oh why?
Why they gotta do me like that?

Why do niggas push pounds and powder?
Why did Bush knock down the towers?
Why you around them cowards?
Why Aaliyah have to take that flight?
Why my nigga D ain't pull out his Ferrari?
Why he take that bike?
Why they gotta open your package and read your mail?
Why they stop lettin' niggas get degrees in jail?
Why you gotta do 85% of your time?
And why do niggas lie in 85% of they rhymes?
Why a nigga always want what he can't have?
Why I can't come through in the pecan Jag?
Why did crack have to hit so hard?
Even though it's almost over, why niggas can't get no jobs?
Why they come up with the witness protection?
Why they let the Terminator win the election?
Come on, pay attention!
Why I sell in the stores what you could sell in the streets?
Why I say the hottest shit but be sellin' the least? why

All that I’ve been given
It's this pain that I’ve been livin'
They got me in the system
Why they gotta do me like that?
Tried to make it my way
But got sent on up the highway
Why? Oh why?
Why they gotta do me like that?

Why Halle have to let a white man pop her to get a Oscar?
Why Denzel have to be crooked before he took it?
Why they didn't make the CL6 with a clutch?
And if you don't smoke
Then why the hell you reachin' for my dutch?!
Why rap? ‘Cause I need air time
Why be on the curb with a ""Why lie? I need a beer"" sign?
Why all the young niggas is dyin'?
‘Cause they moms at work
They pops is gone,
 
they livin' with iron
Why they ain't give us a cure for AIDS?
Why my diesel have fiends in the spot on the floor for days?
Why you screamin' like it's a slug? It's only the hawk
Why my buzz in L.A. ain't like it is in New York?
Why they forcin' you to be hard?
Why ain't you a thug by choice?
Why the whole world love my voice?
Why? Try to tell 'em that it's the flow, son
And you know why they made the new twenties?
‘Cause I got all the old ones — that's why!

All that I’ve been given
Is this pain that I’ve been livin'
They got me in the system
Why they gotta do me like that?
Tried to make it my way
But got sent on up the highway
Why? Oh why?
Why they gotta do me like that?",https://genius.com/Jadakiss-why-lyrics
We Gonna Make It,Kiss Tha Game Goodbye,2001.0,"Fuck the frail shit, uh, 'cause when my coke come in
They gotta use the scale that they weigh the whales with
Carlssons on the jeep, Bugatti made the prototype
Hoped you'd get the picture but you just can't photo life
Determined niggas make it
Kicking down the door and we burning niggas naked
The house costs a million, sitting on the beach
And the only thing I know: if it's furnished I'ma take it
My bathtub lift up, my walls do a 360
We got the shit that the government got
Talking money then you rubbing the spot
Real niggas say that they be wilding
We on the Cayman Islands on a yacht with our favorite albums
A bad ho and a plate of salmon, smoking and drinking
Nigga is you thinking that our fate is violent?
I love my nigga for the fact that he real
And nobody on the faculty squeal
And if you facing capital pun, pass me a gun
And I'ma give you time to run while I rapidly peel, uh

We gon' make it
We gon' make it, we gon' make it
We gon' make it
We gon' make it, we gon' make it
We gon' make it

I learned the game quickly, and I don't like to rent
So when I fly now, I bring my cars on the plane with me
In this case who's the loser?
Ran through enough coke for Castro to build schools in Cuba
Teaching kids how to read and write and use the Ruger
Motherfuckin' niggas is back, Jada and P
We got water, X, haze, plus weight of the D
And I'm tired of hearing about old niggas that had it
And be the same old niggas that ratted (Who cares?)
Talking 'bout how we hawk niggas in they fuckin' back
Gun work's official but niggas don't be wanting that
(Why?) 'Cause they puss and they mans is lame
We Soul for Real in the hood, we make Candy Rain
I could easily send you to God
But come and see me at the Plaza Hotel I might give you a job
If you can't remember the name
All you gotta do is ask the dame for the niggas that deliver it hard

We gon' make it
We gon' make it, we gon' make it
We gon' make it
We gon' make it, we gon' make it

Jada-MWAH, I'll kiss you, you bitch ass nigga
Bet the hood won't miss you, you bitch ass nigga
Might find your man dead in the ocean (he be aight though)
You know dead rappers get better promotion
Why we don't laugh at death, and cry at birth
Never say you can't do it 'til you try it first
Be the young niggas eager to pull it
But it's a message in everything, trust me, even a bullet
Go to war with the 8 and the pound
Think you got your ear to the street now
Put your face in the ground 'cause my shells is expensive
You'll know exactly why when you yellin' in intensive
My fellas is offensive
Lucky 'cause I got guns that crack your back
But that's not what I prefer, I manufacture crack
And niggas turn bitch when you show em the steel
But we know how to bid so y'all go 'head and squeal
I'm comfortable far from home
Eating right, getting good rest either on the bar or the phone
I'm the reason niggas got deals the past few years
""Sound anything like Kiss? Then sign right here!""
And, y'all just talking, I'm doing it well
Jadakiss, motherfucker, I'ma see you in hell

We gon' make it
We gon' make it, we gon' make it
We gon' make it
We gon' make it, we gon' make it
We gon' make it",https://genius.com/Jadakiss-we-gonna-make-it-lyrics

You made history! 1.1 million in a short week!
Ha-HAA! Screw a press conference!
Press this on your conscience!
D-Block, cheers! YEAH! Ah-ha-ha
I ain't mad, I don't wanna sound mad, I feel marvelous
D-Block, Double R
, fuckin' faggots!

We gon' handle this like grown men, you won't win
You don't even feel comfortable in your own skin
I rap my ass off, I'm fightin' the champ with the glass jaw
At the Garden or Nassau (Uh-huh)
See me, couple hood niggas behind stars
I heard you put a couple good niggas behind bars (Preme!)
I might never sell that much
But you can bet your last two quarters I never tell that much
Picture 'Kiss not come out swingin'
It's like going to see 50 at a show
And he don't come out singin' (C'mon!)
Yeah, you got a felony, but you ain't a predicate (Nuh-uh)
Never the King of New York, you live in Connecticut (Haha)
You don't be in the hood, you be in the woods
Fuckin' with me, it's where you really gon' be for good (Ugh)
I hold the 4-5 myself (Ch-chk)
And hop out the Range on 1-4-5 myself (What up!)
This is a true fact
Since when has it become cool to get shot and not shoot back? (Never)
Trackmasters shelved you (Ugh),
 
Bravehearts helped you (Ugh)
Then everybody felt you (Uh-huh), now I gotta melt you (Yeah)
And don't try to pull rank on 'Kiss
‘Cause the niggas I'ma send to do it ain't gon' miss
Be layed up stiff,
 
I spit straight up piff
I did real songs with Big, no made-up shits (Ah!)
And I don't got a problem with clout
You ain't get shot again yet
So what's your second album about?
 (Nothin'!)
Your raps are pre-school
You made a lot of money, now be cool
'Fore I swell up your lips like seafood (Mmm)
Can I get a mic check?
You don't stand a chance at the dance with me, dawg
Your steps ain't right yet (Uh-uh)
Block is just fine, homie, the D's straight (D-Block)
Most likely, your new CD is a weed plate (Haha)
Bunch of love songs, 100% pure garbage (Garbage)
Just somethin' to break up buds on
You should just sell clothes and sneakers
‘Cause outta your whole camp
Your flow's the weakest (Garbage)
I'm in the town where the young boys is clappin' (Clappin)
You runnin' around with the lieutenant and captain (Haha!)
It'll take a lifetime to see 'Kiss
You had to get shot 9 times to be rich

Rat-ass nigga, you's a animal
You's a motherfuckin' animal
Pig-ass nigga, you's a animal
You's a motherfuckin' animal
Snake-ass nigga, you's a animal
You's a motherfuckin' animal
Matter of fact, you ain't no animal
I'ma show these motherfuckers how to handle you

By Your Side,Kiss of Death,2004.0,"[Intro: Jadakiss & 
Barbara Lewis

I'll be by your side, I'll always find a way
General, we got these niggas
Fucking cockroaches, you wanna go to war? HA-HAAAEEH!
I love you too much to lose your sweet touch and your love
I'd find you

(
By your side
)
It makes me strong
It gives me the strength to bang out and make these songs
If I do it on the spot or if it takes me long
They can't stop me, even if my brakes was on
I'm still (
by your side
)
I'm always here, nobody’s perfect, life ain't always fair
I used to not give a fuck, I ain't always care
When it’s too hot for the hammer
You know the hawk is right (
by your side
)
Until you get to the car
And you gotta get through the D before you get to the R
If I don't get you today then I'ma get you tomorrow
As soon as you come out your crib I'ma be right (
by your side
)
Where I’m supposed to be
Close to you, with the toast close to me
And screw it if it’s the right or the wrong thing
When you in the sight of that long thing
You wish you had a strong team (
by your side
)

I love you too much to lose your sweet touch and your love
I'd find you
By your side, by your side
I love you too much to lose your sweet touch and your love
I'd find you

As long as you need me
I'm down for whatever homie as long as you feed me
I pull the big joints out as long as the TV
Or I can play my part and just breathe easy, right (
by your side
)
As soon as something happen to you
Your niggas are bouncin' and you thought they were scrappin' witcha you
Now you cleanin' your cuts with peroxide
And you wake up in the ER with the Doc, right (
by your side
)
Puttin tubes in you
And you can’t even eat right, they puttin’ food in you
Your body’s getting colder, Devil on your shoulder
And your moms is in the room but you just wanna hold her (
by your side
)
Nothin but realness
That's why everybody in the world could feel this
I'm on top and y'all under me
So when it's over; if I ain't in the front
At least I'm gonna be (
by your side
)

I love you too much to lose your sweet touch and your love
I'd find you
By your side, by your side
I love you too much to lose your sweet touch and your love
I'd find you

Until they finish me off
If they don't get us both you'll be sending me off
And please just do me this favor: stick to our little plan
And fuck the money, just keep my little man (
by your side
)
And show 'em there's hope
And he gon' think he know how it's going
But show him the ropes
And if you bring him to the Gucci store, show him the loafs
Hood niggas I'm just showing you growth
But I'm still right (
by your side
)
You know Kiss
Don't gotta aim his gun at you to be focused
And if you broke now nigga when you see those chips
Watch how many people come out of nowhere
And try to be (
by your side
)
The answer's plenty
'Cause when you, handling business you can't be friendly
And if you, tryin to stack something can't be pennies
Most likely Grants and Benjies
And you better keep 'em (
by your side
)

I love you too much to lose your sweet touch and your love
I'd find you
By your side, by your side
I love you too much to lose your sweet touch and your love
I'd find you
By your side
By your side
By your side

Welcome to D-Block,Kiss of Death,2004.0,"Welcome to D-Block, the city of broke down dreams
Where things ain't always peachy keen as they seem
City of dope dealers, killers, pimps, pushers
Panhandlers, hustlers and doped out fiends
The sun don't shine here, in this part of town
But we all got a town that's similar to this too
Say every city's got a ghetto, every ghetto's got a hood
Take a good look around you cause there's a D-Block near you

Place where ain't nobody that proud, it's a fucking black cloud
That got people under the impression they can act wild
Working around though, cause if you can pull a trigger on the pound yo
5 minutes flat, the whole town know
Lotta assuming in niggas' salary
More lies than truth definitely more rumors than reality
Only way you beating a body is technicality
Other than that catch 'em in Clinton on the gallery
The determination and dedication and discipline
Listening and catching the jewels that you was missing
And they still doing coward shit
You know the hate is gonna always be heavy but the love overpowers it
Something in the air but the older they get
They kill you quicker over a girl than over a brick
We don't play with the lizards, we make phrases up and say 'em exquisite
Anytime you can pay us a visit

Welcome to D-Block, the city of broke down dreams
Where things ain't always peachy keen as they seem
City of dope dealers, killers, pimps, pushers

But we all got a town that's similar to this too
Say every city's got a ghetto, every ghetto's got a hood
Take a good look around you cause there's a D-Block near you

Welcome to D-Block, the mighty mighty D-Block
The place in New York City where Diddy won't even walk
Its D-Block, the part of Yonkers
 I wouldn't be caught
Without two pistols on me that'll be cocked in each pocket
D-Block don't even stop to talk, you just keep walking
Stick up kids every block who watch for every opportunity
As soon as you leave out that jewelry shop
And you won't even notice your mind will be so
Preoccupied with that new watch you just copped
You won't even see that ride pulling up alongside you
You'll be shot 'fore you even realize you were spied on for three blocks
D-Block the place where O.G.'s get knocked, locked up
Get out come home for a week and get re-knocked
You won't even see cops, 
hip-hop police don't even stop
On D-Block, where everybody wants to be 'Pac
And you can get popped over the new G-Unit Reeboks

Welcome to D-Block, the city of broke down dreams
Where things ain't always peachy keen as they seem
City of dope dealers, killers, pimps, pushers
Panhandlers, hustlers and doped out fiends

But we all got a town that's similar to this too
Say every city's got a ghetto, every ghetto's got a hood
Take a good look around you cause there's a D-Block near you

If you bust and your gun got niggas on the run
And you rep where you from nigga you D-Block
And you trying to come up and your pockets is light as a cup
And don't give a fuck, you D-Block
Aiyo bang bang nigga, let's get it on
Always been a monster, but its worse now that my son's been born
And every nigga where I be, I put in work for free
It's D-Block mothafucka, hey yo grab this P

Welcome to D-Block, a place where little niggas is killas
And the mother's raising the sons to turn into gorillas
And the hallways is pissy as hell, all we do is get bigger
More ignorant, you send us to jail
My niggas shoot anything that'll move
Sell drugs, from the rise to the sun to the fall of the moon
I'd die the way I stand with my man if I can when the shells come
This is D Block, ya'll welcome

Welcome to D-Block, the city of broke down dreams
Where things ain't always peachy keen as they seem

Automatic or revolving

Most beams is infared, but mine's is flourescent
No matter where you go, I'mma spot you
No matter how many people you put me in front of, I'mma rock you
And if you try to be the hard top, I'mma drop you
I got to, treat you like the clutch, and pop you
Creep threw, in the 4-20 with your honey
Cuz you ain't nuthin' but a playboy that turned bunny
And the only the thing left to discuss is more money
In these bullshit games these chickens, try to run me
Ya'll know ya'll can't touch us, I flow lushes
It's so real I make her hop out, and get the dutches
I'm sittin on a thousand birds, and I hide from the cameras (why?)
Cuz a picture's, worth a thousand words
Since ya'll herbs, ya'll get what ya'll deserve
Ya'll do the catering, while we just get served
And you got some nerve, for P-Hing
Jason, 
do you have any idea who you facing?
Just something about my shit, you'll never figure out

You trying to buy property, set it up for growing coke
Niggas making a movie, so I came to edit
Wiping everybody out, right before the credits
I'm a hard guy to get along with, get on a song with
When shit be going right, I flip into the wrong shit
The prime artist, expect me to rhyme hardest
Slash con artist, gonna get mine regardless
I ain't even big and I size niggas up
Cuz they eyes give em up, look at em and see they butt
I'm 22 with 10 ends
 so there that go
You hear that flow that 
drove the underground wacko
Every since 12 I've been spittin like tabacco
Relax though, Pop the tape CD and the wax though
They wonder how, but the thing about ours
We open up 24 hours
Niggas don't sleep with eat so when they speak it mean power
So you should keep quiet, you a coward
About to be layed out flat, and pushing up flowers

Uh, yo

Dear Christopher ""Frank White"" Wallace
Yeah it's your boy Kiss I just want to holla
In your memory I keep the Coogi in my closet
Kangol on the rack, a fresh pair of Wallies
You know I'm still the liquor and the weed child
And still got Branson on speed dial
And everybody's the king now
You ain't gotta be nice getting shot is the thing now
Mafia was doing their best, they separated
Now Roc and Gutta doing a stretch, uh, yeah
Kim is still in it to win it
I seen Money L awhile ago but I ain't heard from Cease in a minute
People in power is queer
I could go on for a year 'bout how it would be if you were still here
The game got cheaper, rappers is more commercially successful now
But the heart's a lot weaker
You know me still got the flow that'll pop speakers
First option on offense the top feature
It's easy BIG all you need is a pro-tool set
And I ain't touch the paper that I was supposed to yet
Everybody that's somebody show respect
Only a matter of time before they notice that
I'm an impeccable lyricist
And with the right mechanics, I could take over be clear of this
They well aware of Kiss the light of the city
And I ain't on the label no more but I'm tighter with Diddy
I got my own plan handle mine like a grown man
Long as I know I'm nice, fuck it I'm my own fan
Remixed the joints you had
But, they could never ever duplicate your swag (Never)
Meanwhile I'm a keep it so on my lil' plans
And you might bump into a few of my lil' mans
Up there stepping with God
And down here Mister Cee in BK still repping you hard
T-yanna so pretty, CJ turned into a Lil' Biggie
Just a little lighter but so witty
On your born day, we get the highest
Groovy still the best with the garments, he keep me the flyest
Tonight, Patron is dead
Only right that I take a bottle of Bacardi Limon to the head
And before I end it, I gotta say thanks
Cause not only was your time well-spent, it was splendid (thanks)
...Miss you, my nigga
One Love (So we tried to hard to understand)

So we tried to hard to understand, why you had to go away
(That was my letter to B.I.G., nahmean?)
You were everything - you were everything
(I felt it was only right, I really smoked with them niggas)
 (Jadakiss)
So we'll just keep our heads to the sky (Drink wit 'em)
(Sat wit 'em, talked wit 'em)
Cause we know we're gonna see you in the next lifetime (Real shit)
But it's never easy saying good-byyyyye
(See you when I get there, Biggie)
Saying - good-byyyyyyyyyyye (Love you)

So we tried to hard to understand, why you had to go away

I'm taking it right there, they leave me no choice

And if she took her pins out
Then her hair would drop down to her calf
I knew her man, he was just up North
And would've got left up North, but he was the chef up North
Anyway I'm K-I-double
All I do is get dough, spit flows, try to stay out of trouble
If you ready we could move, just lose your man
Or hit the dance floor, I'll show you how to do my dance
Or I might let you play in the garden
Or sit up in that white thing and listen to the greatest of Marvin
The estate got 6 locations
Take so long to get to the front once I missed probation
And I hate to brag
I know ya man really wouldn't like the Beretta but he'd hate the Mag
And yeah here go a blank check, rock yourself out
But in the mean time girl - knock yourself out

Oh you modeling momma? (knock yourself out)
Wanna let ya hair down? (knock yourself out)
Oh you ready to move? (knock yourself out)
What you wanna sit in the Coupe? (knock yourself out)
Wanna keep on dancing? (knock yourself out)
Wanna run in my mansion? (knock yourself out)
Sit in V.I.P.? (knock yourself out)
Bitch you just wanna be seen (knock yourself out)

Now you can knock yourself out like you boxin yourself
Or you can get real freaky, start popping yourself
And my watch got so many rocks, when you look at the time
It's sorta like you watching yourself, uhh
Front if you want, I puff a few blunts
And take a cruise in a Porsche with the trunk in the front
She had the Jocko Broshure sandals, told her hop in
The coupe blew her mind when she couldn't find the door handles
Attitude very high maintenance; 
check this out ma
I'm running out of my patience
Don't sleep with me? Then don't speak with me
And never talk bad about niggas that eat with me

Oh you modeling momma? (knock yourself out)
Wanna let ya hair down? (knock yourself out)
Oh you ready to move? (knock yourself out)
What you wanna sit in the Coupe? (knock yourself out)
Wanna keep on dancing? (knock yourself out)
Wanna run in my mansion? (knock yourself out)
Sit in V.I.P.? (knock yourself out)
Bitch you just wanna be seen (knock yourself out)

Ayyo, honey know I'm waiting to leave
Keep dancing, cause I like how that ass shake in them capris
I'm like Big with the murder mamis up in Belize
But I'll still fuck a chickenhead like Lil' Cease
I don't care if they model, bet they all goin' chill
First nigga to cook base on a Foreman grill
And you might win some, but you just lost one
Kiss miseducates 'em like Lauryn Hill
Oh you modeling momma? (knock yourself out)
Wanna let ya hair down? (knock yourself out)
Oh you ready to move? (knock yourself out)
What you wanna sit in the Coupe? (knock yourself out)
Wanna keep on dancing? (knock yourself out)
Wanna run in my mansion? (knock yourself out)
Sit in V.I.P.? (knock yourself out)
Bitch you just wanna be seen (knock yourself out)
Oh you modeling momma? (knock yourself out)
Wanna let ya hair down? (knock yourself out)
Oh you ready to move? (knock yourself out)
What you wanna sit in the Coupe? (knock yourself out)
Wanna keep on dancing? (knock yourself out)
Wanna run in my mansion? (knock yourself out)
Sit in V.I.P.? (knock yourself out)
Bitch you just wanna be seen (knock yourself out)
Oh you modeling momma? (knock yourself out)
Are you ready to move
Wanna keep on dancing? (knock yourself out)",https://genius.com/Jadakiss-knock-yourself-out-lyrics
Can’t Stop Me,The Last Kiss,2009.0," (Jadakiss)
Oooh babe, oooh babe, oooh babe (Gets even better) Baby
Oooh babe, oooh babe, can't stop me baby!
Oooh babe, oooh babe, oooh babe, baby
Oooh babe, oooh babe, can't stop me baby!

Ummm hmmm yes I does that
Stays hot I ain't gotta get my buzz back
What everybody tryin to be now I was that
They could never stop me, that's why I love rap
Been livin the life, crazy ice
Hit the baddest chicks in the world, maybe twice
The swag, the gear, the bread
All the whips is a year ahead I only fear the feds
Forty five on the other side of the peep hole
Head shot from point blank call it a free throw
Funny cause I had the +Vision+ since Coleco
Back then, still ain't reach my peak though
Louis loafers, Polo peak coat
Call me, whenever the bosses meet yo
Uh, I drove papi crazy
So the industry never 'gon stop me baby

You can't stop me now you can't stop me
No you can't stop me now you can't stop me
You can't stop me now you can't stop me (You, can't, stop, me baby)
You can't stop me now you can't stop me
No you can't stop me now you can't stop me
You can't stop me now you can't stop me (You, can't, stop, me baby)

Yo, I'm a call it confidence cause I ain't cocky
I just know one thing they can't stop me
Whether I'm on 5th or L.A. at the swap meet
It's all good cause I know the gangstas got me
First things first the jars are broccoli
I treat the rap game like a large monopoly
One on one, niggas can't guard me properly
And when they double team me the odds are sloppy
I move like them eighty milograms of oxy
Send your sister back to your family knock kneed
Got too hot for the grams who got weed?
In the rap bracket he remains the top seed
Revolver holds six, quick to blow three
Audio heroin so you don't O.D
Shooters know you, but you don't know me
The block is crazy can't stop me baby, uh!

You can't stop me now you can't stop me
No you can't stop me now you can't stop me
You can't stop me now you can't stop me (You, can't, stop, me baby)
You can't stop me now you can't stop me
No you can't stop me now you can't stop me
You can't stop me now you can't stop me (You, can't, stop, me baby)

Yo, once I start, I ain't 'gon stop the squeezin
And the gauze ain't 'gon be able to stop the bleedinN
And your girl ain't 'gon be able to stop the wheezin (nah)
When she get that phone call from the doc, we even
You could not stop me, so stop believin
Ringtone rap, this is not the season
Punch lines hard enough to stop your breathin
And the ladies'll still pay a lot to see him
I'm a get rich long as I got my freedom
Usually when you get hit it's for a reason
If you in the hood, better dodge the Ds'and
Watch your Qs'and, be on your Ps' and
Thank y'all all for comin out this evening
Havin a good time with your liquor and treason
Even if they knock me, then continue to watch me
They still wouldn't be able to stop me
What?

You can't stop me now you can't stop me
No you can't stop me now you can't stop me
You can't stop me now you can't stop me (You, can't, stop, me baby)
You can't stop me now you can't stop me
No you can't stop me now you can't stop me
You can't stop me now you can't stop me (You, can't, stop, me baby)

Uh, uh, uh, Neo, Da Matrix!
They can't stop me
(You, can't, stop, me baby)
I'm too strong, too strong! Way too strong
(You can't stop me babyyyy...)
They can't stop me! Hahahaha!

Time’s Up,Kiss of Death,2004.0,"Yeah, yo, I'm the nigga with the perpetual oyster bars
Mother of pearl delivery, voice of God
And it's hard just being the boss
Being I can't go to jail 'cause them years will cost me
Don't get me wrong, lay a nigga down if he force me
Rather just sit back and roll a dutch
Think about how I'ma put the game in the cobra clutch
Think about how I'ma get the 'caine over Customs
Never underestimate niggas or over trust them
Uh, yeah, them M's is right in my face
I just got to throw my Timbs on and tighten my lace
If it don't jam, the TEC will spray
When I spit everybody gotta split like pepper spray
'Cause I'm a nigga that hate to settle
And I'm a man of the Lord but I still can't shake the devil
Moved away and still can't escape the ghetto, what?!

The time to talk is up
So bring the heat, playtime is over
While you running your mouth I'm creeping up over your shoulder
A gun, a knife, a bat, a brick, anything I can get my hands on
Call my bluff, 
start acting up, and I'll leave you underground

I know how to get my peers off me
They can cry and die from high blood pressure 'cause tears are salty
It's a symptom if you bobbing your head
You know that he's sick
You know the flow is ridic', now throw him a grip
When I get it, you already know I'm throwing them bricks
Putting purple everywhere
, daddy, I'm throwing them nicks
That's right, homie, you can't move me
I ain't going nowhere, I'm in the hood like bootleg movies
All you shooting is the breeze,
 a bootleg Uzi
I'm just waiting on a q like Suzie
, don't lose me
These penitentiary chances that I take
Should be able to get the mansion by the lake
But I invest my bread into something else
Into something else that'll make something melt
You just got to feel the kid
If not rap for the fact of how real he is, what up

The time to talk is up
So bring the heat, playtime is over
While you running your mouth I'm creeping up over your shoulder
A gun, a knife, a bat, a brick, anything I can get my hands on
Call my bluff, 
start acting up, and I'll leave you underground

Ayo, niggas know the champ is in here
He took it from crack to rap, now he put out two anthems a year
And I just want to rock for a century
And then chase the book with the documentary
If you, can't do nothing other than flow
Life's a bitch like the mother from 
Blow
, let's go
Don't make me put your heart in your lap
Fuck riding the beat, nigga, I parallel park on the track
Hop out looking crispy, fresh and new
In the six, but it's a BM, and it's Pepsi blue
And, I don't know you
But I know a man becomes a man from all the shit that he go through
Y'all ain't fuckin with
 
Jason
After I cash in, there's really no justification
Of how I'm gonna change the game, so don't get out of line
'Cause this little nine will change your frame, what up

The time to talk is up
So bring the heat, playtime is over
While you running your mouth I'm creeping up over your shoulder

Still Feel Me,Kiss of Death,2004.0,"Uh-huh, real life shit
Na'mean, true story
Feel me, matter of fact still feel me
Uh, yeah

Ayo, past few years shit got so ill
Kinda hard for the God to laugh through tears
I went through something with momma, no drama
Something that came and went, real life karma
My pop think his son is deserting him, its hurtin him
Guess I gotta be the man, sit down and work with him
My little boy 7, he the sequel to the thug
So I told him the money will never equal the love
Listen I'm grown y'all
When it comes to my family it ain't never a problem, it's only a phone call
They tend to take that and run with it
So every other month I be on some new phone, new number shit
They violated Stay again
Gus totaled the Beamer and broke Kay leg again
Shhh, let us pray again
And I ain't get enough of hanging in the local bars yet
Had to let the thing off, 'cross town in the projects
All these rumors and shit, I ain't get robbed yet
Bitch ass niggas ain't stop acting like broads yet
In arm reach off a gun and a mask
Somebody clipped me for a hundred in cash
Still feel me, I hit the road try to get more grip
It was cool 'til a muh'fucking tour bus flipped
Uh, no charges brought up, bitch popped up with a kid
Got caught up, then I put a court up
Now the road to the riches is taking me longer
It ain't kill yet so it making me stronger
I don't know if its the hate, frustration, or hunger
That keep a nigga going, rapping for a reason
Shit don't just don't happen, shit happens for a reason
I'm that dude, like it or love it
I do my thing in the hood, and get right with a budget
Ain't afraid to give my life to the public
And when you see me next time maybe we can further discuss
How my 16's give you a visual
I know you thinking he ain't really selling, how he live off residuals
But right now the game is pitiful
Niggas is lonely, they need company 'cause they miserable
Yeah, uh-huh shit it still real B
That's why I want you to still feel me

Still feel me, one, I'm out",https://genius.com/Jadakiss-still-feel-me-lyrics
What If,The Last Kiss,2009.0,"Yo, take a second
What if we could rewind the hood?
Better yet, what if the LOX woulda signed with Suge?
What if Puffy never signed us?
What if Oprah made them comments like Imus?
What if you designed this?
Thought like I did, said it like this
What if Peyton was fightin' dogs instead of Mike Vick?
What if Arnold woulda just let Tookie get Life?
What if BIG missed the party?
What if Pac missed the fight?
What if you was caged in?
What would you change then?
What if there was no Rockefeller law for made men?
What if the hate ran through me?
And what if Portland woulda drafted Jordan instead of Sam Bowie?
What if you really had to be nice to get a deal?
What if all of these rappers ice was really real?
What if I hit you wit the razor from cheek to chin?
What if Mike Jackson never woulda bleached his skin?

What if you neva knew things that you needed to know?
What if you neva been places you needed to go?
What if you get there and learn them as you go?
What if is the question, can I ask them once more?

What if the pain went away?
What if you changed in a day?
What if you could eliminate all the games people played?
What if Shyne beat the case?
What if Diddy did a dime flat?
What if Nelson Mandela could give his time back?
What if Malcolm was silent?
What if Martin was violent?
What if you could really sneak a Uzi on the Island?
Yeah, what if I made you kiss the nina?
What if a brick was only just a misdemeanor?
What if Manhattan was hit by Hurricane Katrina?
What if a Black man was the one controllin' FEMA?
What if we ain't never let emotions come between us?
What if the last time we rode somebody seen us?
(Hook) Jadakiss 2x

Yo, I flow calm but don't push
What if Saddam hung Bush?
What if 'One Mic' was called one hook?
What if the Bridge never showed me how to hold a weapon?
What if I ran up in that sick chick with no protection?
What if I never wore an Army jacket?
Carhartt to match it, unlaced Timbs
The hood on my first album cover under plastic
What if I was another corny rapper?
What if I went instead of Notorious?
Who would tell my story after?
What if I love less and lust more?
If Obama was on Rushmore
Would Ali give Tyson a bust jaw?
What if I never glared out that project window?
Would neva be scared for the life of me and my kinfolk
What if that gun pin broke?
I would never laid back in the Enzo, all red
What if real niggas was all dead?
What if Hilary and them was Reptilian?
And 2012 was the end of men and all world civilians?

I’m Sorry Ms. Jackson (50 Cent diss),UnKnown,UnKnown,"When it's all said and done
After they said I've won
All I'm going to say is...

I'm sorry Ms. Jackson
I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson
I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times

Tried to diss kiss to the world
And it's your fault cause she said she saw you kissing a girl
The hood was behind her for her whole career
But now they've slightly starting to disappeared
Something about that
She's always angry
Might have been when them girls trying to push her scalp back
Needed some head room
So she went out and bought Tyson's mansion with 18 bedrooms
She's a domestic boss
That don't leave no marks though, you got to digest those scares
In fact think you got to tell her to get back
Because every kiss rap is similar to a bitch slap
Too hard since way back in the school yard
She's hollywood though all she needs is a boobjob
Girl in the bubble, didn't mean to trouble her
Man but im a Calico, im double her
Really think you should tell her to chill cause
My resume is longer than a doctor bill was
I did the song with ja rule bigging the city up
She did the magic stick remix with olivia
She got more money but I get busier
Think somebody going to end up killing her

When it's all said and done
After they said I've won
All I'm going to say is...

I'm sorry Ms. Jackson
I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson
I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times

Hood had love for this bitch
Cause she came from south side queens with a thug ass click
Bitch got change, and she changed
Now she don't fuck with the hood, probably give a nigga brains
Bitch got boogie on a nigga
Went from the hood to hollywood got a movie on a nigga
Bitch talking greasy like new york sting
Sucking down south dick that's some new york thing
And the bitch used to be cool, hood even liked the bitch
We used to listen to her gettin’ the weed
She had stories of many men, times in the club and niggas that was wanksta but the truth was to see
Bitch ain't shyt, she was real good at bluffing it
Ordered protection on the niggas she was fucking with
Now that's a ho that you just can't trust
Hired cops, that's a ho that you just can't touch
Bitch moved out new york when they were swinging them Glocks
Bitch got a deep voice but she would be singing a lot
Bitch would sell her soul just to get on the charts
Want to front like she's gangsta but she got no heart
And she going to get hit by the mac and
All in the back and this time i bet the jaw will be cracking
She's going to get broken to fractions d block is the faction
All i can say is im sorry ms. jackson

I'm sorry Ms. Jackson
I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson
I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times",https://genius.com/Jadakiss-im-sorry-ms-jackson-50-cent-diss-lyrics

I've got a couple rappers heads on the wall of my crib (Real talk)
Head huntin', so that means they goin' all in your wig
I make millions, when I die, I leave it all to my kids
One eye in the scope, just for accurate zoomin'
I'm in the hood with the live bait and tackle for humans (I got it)

All the record label cheat codes, none for me though
Shout to Ebro
, and fine rhyme lovers who don't buy it
Petition but don't riot, the critics be so quiet
To question my content is nonsense
It undermines all I've accomplished
They say all's fair in love and war
You say I moved the line just to score, head shot to keep Adidas pure
One man army like Ason
Threw more powder in the air than LeBron
I'm sellin' Avon, that means the foundation is caked on
Y
ou know what this commission is based on

A yo, the crib got your friends working
We travel to France for french curtains, you was there when I was on the bench hurtin’
Now that I own my team, it’s only right that I condone my queen
Try to show her my dream
And I can’t let her get lost now, she carries the money
The hammer and material across town
And understand she fine, understand she mine
She understand the grind, cooks, clean, and irons
And whatever she wanna push I’mma cosign
And if I ain’t got it already than I’mma go find it
I guess I’mma lucky don, and she’s a lucky queen
Cause her jewelry box look likes Lucky Charms
All color stones and she know that I’m in the hood
But she also knows that I’m coming home
Mr. Raspy, thought I was in love with money
‘Til the first time we getting nasty, ah

Gave you your income tax checks so I can get on with
Those were the days, these are the times
You held me down with nearly damn near everything, even my rhymes
I will play a song for you and you will let me know exactly
How the ladies will respond from a women’s point of view
And that’s why my girl is with me
I love it when she layin’ in the bed with a Pearl Long Vickie
The next best thing to a soldier
Go hard with a fat ass and a head full of rollers
Just look in her eyes and tell she’s real
Just imagine the way she smell and the way she feel
The sex was crazy then and crazy still
And you know I’m from the streets so its crazy ill
And we waiting on the New Island, we been to all them
Four-five times, come on, mommy, you whilin’

And till we catch u stretch u like u elastic


Daytona she want me to bone her
Damn all I bought her was a shot and a corona
Smoking on that good you know the aroma
I guarantee if you don’t die it leave you in a coma
Niggas hate they home I fall
I get the love across the board
I got pills in west Virginia
I got dope in Baltimore
NYC I'm heavy here
I got bitches everywhere
You know you can count on me to drop an anthem every year
I'm in the hood I’m in the trap
I can hustle I can rap
Be in barney's, be in bloomies, be in neiman’s be in sakks
We be working with them hawks
We be playin with them gats
Put my young boys on the strip
We been playin with the packs
Never that, bring that cheddar back
If not hear the baretta clap
Your fault you shoulda measured that
Bad white bitch guess where I met her at..


Real bout shit kick back wit my feet up
All day I dream about stacks adidas
My double cup runneth over, and I ain't talkin' lean
Forgiatos rollin', Im thinking on a bean
Everything exotic, I ball with Resilience
The whip the italian my bitch she Brazilian
Cut color clarity ice game is brilliant
Ferrari moon walking no floors no ceiling
Oops my bad I shit it on the ho
Check got..spit it on the low
I know dat was disgusting but the watch'll make you sick
Cuz the perpetual moving roley don't tick
All black everything call me Darth Vader
Got an old black bulldog I make it bark hater

Smoking Gun,The Last Kiss,2009.0,"You're the only one I love
The only man I know that I can trust
And if I ever should need you
I know you'll come ready to kill
With a smoking gun
With a smoking gun
Uh huh, uh huh, with a smoking gun
Uh huh, uh huh, with a smoking gun
Uh huh, uh huh I know you'll come ready to kill
With a smoking gun

Yo, shorty is courageous, going through the stages
Of where her body is more mature than her age is
Far from the daddy's little girl type
Can't even imagine what her world's like
It all started off from a young'n
Stepfather used to touch her and she couldn't say nothing
The more she in held to the pain, it kept coming
Eventually, it scarred for life as a woman
And then he just kept touching her
Inside, that was crushing her
I got something to discuss with her
I'm coming with the tech with the air holes and the muffler


Yo, now she really stressed bad, baby by her step dad
Her and little man all alone up in Westhab
Tough road and without a car, it's a tough walk
Worst part about it is her mom think is her fault
Word get around yall, you know how the town talk
Babygirl is innocent, labeled her a town whore
Suicidal thoughts on her mind, even now more
First the abuse, now she gotta raise her child poor
And that's why I feel for you
That's why I'm ready to kill for you
That's a black girl lost for you
Call me, I'll come through and let it off for you (Blaow)


Yo, it ain't your fault boo, I'm always here for you to talk to
Hold your head high when you walk though
Sometimes the devil's temptation will force you
But one thing about the lord, he'll never cross you
Look at all the bad things that they tried to do to you
And you still queen of the earth and you're beautiful
Everything happens for a reason
If you ever need me, call me, I'm coming through squeezing (Blaow)",https://genius.com/Jadakiss-smoking-gun-lyrics
Put Your Hands Up,Kiss Tha Game Goodbye,2001,"Turn the fuckin beat on!
Ha!! Yeah, we back! S.D.!
I had to switch back to Dom Perignon in rap baby!
Cock-and-run to stay in the business
Son of a bitch! Double R, look at me now motherf..
Two-thousand-and-one, ""Kiss the Game Goodbye"" - let's get it on!

It's the J-A-D-A, I got beef with the feds and the D-A
I got footage of the game, press replay
I got bitches in the club all over me, ma take it ea-sy
And y'all scared I can tell
That I'mma get Bucks like Milwaukee, cause like Sam, I ca' sell
I'm that nigga y'all know that
Bang you in tha yard then slide off on the early go-back
In the streets I flash the cannon like Kodak
And I spray threes, so say cheese
I already told you I'm lookin for enemies
Double R, so of course it's better
I love cornrows and Farrah Fawcett feathers
It's a message in a glass bottle read the letter
Money in the bank, membership, Visa sweaters
And we ride or d-i-e together

Uh uh, come on, put ya hands up
Nah, fuck that, put ya hands down
 Come on, put ya hands up
Nah, fuck that put ya hands down

Y'all know I got the master flow, fast or slow
Y'all wanna know who the best is? ask ya ho
The honies don't lie they love it
And they cop for real, so trust me dogg, the thugs will dub it
'Kiss hit you with consecutive hot shit
Therefore nobody ever gon' spit like I spit
Get money just to walk through, off the books
So when you mention my name, shit is off the hook
Shirts is off, titties is out
And you know when I'm there, hardest niggas in the city is out
I'm in the club, ice over the thermal, waitin' for you to try me-
When the lights get low I'mma burn you
Start with straight shots, and then pop bottles
Flirt with the hood rats, then pop models
You gotta slay two or more, ma, that's our motto
And y'all might get down with the team if y'all swallow


(Muahh) Kiss the game goodbye, the game is mine
You thought wrong? change ya mind
I'm the nigga that'll pop the king, and scoop the queen
And take over the town with a ruthless team
New S-Type wagon, future green
Gun heavy, pants saggin, I'm used to cream
Who you know can make a million dollar bail on cash?
Never did a day and got the jails on smash., K-I double
I move the perico quick, and let the manteca bubble
'Kiss been a boss, y'all just start workin
Now put ya hands up 'til ya'll arms start hurtin
And don't put 'em down 'til I tell you
Whoever wanna be hard headed'll find out what the shells do
Now you can put 'em down if you want

Ain’t Nothin New,Top 5 Dead or Alive,2015.0,"Seeing if a seven-digit check cleared
All in the connect's ear
Driving cars that come out next year
Block lit, all I did was come out for some fresh air
Big chain, nice watch, fresh gear, heck yeah
Killers respect killers, soft niggas respect fear
Crazy 'cause I love it but I hate it that I rep there
Sad part about it is that I made it when I left there
Sorry to whoever anticipated my death here
You die, they hope, don't sleep, stay woke
The more money you get, the more it's your fault they broke
Catch a bullet in your culo
In the hood that's how they do though
'Cause ain't nothin' new, yo, what?!

This ain't nothin' new, this ain't nothin' new
To nigga like me, man, this what I do
And you got lied to if they said this ain't what I do
This ain't nothin' new, it ain't nothin' new
Nah, but maybe to a nigga like you
'Cause round here man, see, see this an everyday thing
No, it ain't nothin' new

Never turn down when it's on, I'm front line
Always respected what's real, I want mine
Anytime they shot up the hood was go time
Once you start cuttin' in life, you so live
If you have some smut on your name, you can't grind
Over reputation and pride we gon' die
When the police asked for the truth, I told lies
And when I finally got in this booth, my soul cried
Once you off the stoop it's through, you no child
Ain't make no excuse for your youth, or no size
See me, I graduated these streets in '05
Still live and die by these rules, you know why?

This ain't nothin' new, this ain't nothin' new
To nigga like me, man, this what I do
And you got lied to if they said this ain't what I do
This ain't nothin' new, it ain't nothin' new
Nah, but maybe to a nigga like you
'Cause round here man, see, see this an everyday thing
No, it ain't nothin' new

HA-HAAAEEH!
Nah, the bars are still lethal
You ain't the top 'til the stars are underneath you
God shuffles the deck, but the cards come from the people
Speakin' from a place where the odds are under equal (Y.O.)
Yeah, end of discussion
Ain't nothin' new, I vocally destroy any production (woo!)
Go get your crew, put my prints on the semi, I'm bustin'
Grateful, I know the difference between plenty and nothin'
I'm on the block, on the crate, sippin' Henny and puffin'
And even though it's all love, keep your enemies lustin'
Lick a shot off then let two go
Let me off the leash, I'm like Koojo
This ain't nothin new yo, what?!

This ain't nothin' new, this ain't nothin' new
To nigga like me, man, this what I do
And you got lied to if they said this ain't what I do

Death Wish,The Last Kiss,2009.0,"They must got a death wish
Cause they was on the road to the riches
Back in the day, but they got off on the exit
Real disrespect shit
Whenever a nigga try to fuck up your investment, it's hard to digest it
These young niggas don't wanna get punched in they faces
So they keep the burner on 'em, and catch a bunch of cases
These old niggas still think they living in the 80's
And shorties that they knew since they were babies turned crazy
The bitches still holla at anybody lookin' like they gettin' a couple dollars
Could fuck, suck and swallow
Ain't nobody winning, but everybody can't lose
The dirt's still there, funeral home ain't move
Going in, coming out gang affiliated
You'd rather go back before being humiliated
A black cloud over the hood, you can't escape it
Dust smoking niggas walking 'round in the matrix
Loyalty is thin, the tension is thick
Look at a broke nigga's face when you mention a brick
Stick-up kids come around when they sense that you rich
Candles and lizzle get lit when you get hit with the fifth
Niggas that used to hoop dream is now selling the piff
And they still ratting but you can't tell if you stiff
Especially when the Tec spit
Fuck around get your head, and your neck hit, looking for a death wish

Talking out your mouth, all reckless
To a nigga that you know, that'll let it off, that's a death wish
When your heart stops, and your body gets breathless
And help don't come in enough time, that's a death wish
When you see the blood and realize that your chest is hit
And don't know where it came from, that's a death wish
When you know a nigga, whole style's on some next shit
And you violate 'em that's a death wish

Young Money!
Ahh, I be on that way left shit
Better get right or get left shit
Better hit right or get left hit
Even if you threw the best pitch
Yes bitch it's Weezy-F bitch, I'm the best bitch
Motherfuck your guest list, I be like, let's just
Kill him and get breakfast, neck slit
Next shit expect this, every time you check this
I'm exit, I mean, excited to be your death wish
Bitch I wear this G shit on my heart, not my necklace
And I keep the Heckler for the hecklers
And I'm from the Mecca of the reckless with a record-breaking death list
The reckless and neglecters think the election won't affect us
I'm high above you, above law, above average
Niggas snitching, put niggas in a can like a beverage
Damn! I 
pop
 at your head, fuck up your memories
I put a bullet in Nina head and let her reminisce
Yeah, if you don't remember shit you goin' remember this
I'm knocking niggas down this year, I'm on my timber shit
Big lion growl at you niggas on that Simba shit
I'll be on that ""Fuck yo' clique, I'll kill every member"" shit
Cold as December shit, bang in any weather shit
And they could buy your bag with body parts sold separate
Yeah, that's a bet bitch like Russian Roulette bitch

Takin shots of Patron, gettin top on yachts
The medallion's a mountain, rock on rocks
The whole world wanna know when this lock gon' drop
Without a doubt, she acknowledge the wealth
Since she ain't give brains, I told her let me get some knowledge of self
Then I told her be proud of yourself and dig deep
And try to see what you could get out of yourself
After all that, I told her to fall back
The Ferrari truck parked in the back is all black
Next time, bring some friends and more 'gnac
It depends how I feel in the morn' if I call back, what

Some rhyme with a name, some rhyme nameless
Don't try to treat me like I ain't famous
My apologies, are you into astrology?
'Cause I'm, I'm tryin' to make it to Uranus
See that's a little Don Juan game
All across your chest like Sean John name
Niggas tryin' to figure out since Kan' came
Who the rookie of the year, me or LeBron James?
They say whoa, don't get caught up in the hype
Ain't no tellin' they gon' love you after tonight
Well if tonight's the night, pop bottles, fuck models

In just about the time that I'm coming out of jail
You'll be coming out ya coma
And guess what Ill split your fucking head open again

When I ain't chilling, I'm killing
So there's no competition
A real nigga with money
That's one hell of a composition
Only costing me five, make it look like it's twenty
They say I look like my mama, I say I look like my money
You can't tell me I ain't looking like a motherfucking million
Played my cards right, now I'm the motherfucker dealing
Got the LV on like a Runnin' Rebel
Duke chain, got cross full of blue devils
No college or nine-to-five, but I'm a grinder
Not the kind of nigga who major in something minor
My shooters like recruiters, they'll come and find ya
Heat every day, I call them the summertimers
Truth be told, you niggas never told the truth
I'm guilty of getting money, and I show the proof
Buy a car like fast food, roll up to the booth
Then I order a new coupe and tell them, hold the roof

I get mine by the seconds, nigga
Shining on them out here 24-7, yeah
Don't trust nothing but your weapon
Get your dough and don't sleep

Get it like I got mine
And they all gon' respect it

I had the crown for so long, can't put it up in the closet
I get millions of dollars, I make heavy deposits
Ain't no if, ands, or maybes, I probably let it go
The one who fathered your style, the guardian of your flow
If your dope is a nine, it's hardly ever slow
I'm in Versace again, probably head to toe
I keep my hands to myself, but I know how to touch you
They say I know how to rap, I say I know how to hustle
Trying to get wavy on me, but I know how to brush you
And now you think you the shit, but I know how to flush you, yeah
Shhh! Quiet money off of loud packs
Watch out for Kentucky, cause they some wild cats
Kingpins turn to wild rats
When you get that paperwork, that's wild facts
I was raised on a hard block
Flipped it twice, get the drop and the hard top
What?

I get mine by the seconds, nigga

I hate you suckers with a passion
Man of the ugly, plug me in
I come to win, kingpin win, I'm mashing
Screams while I'm stepping through
Some kind of respect is due
Chief with the spear like the Seminoles, FSU
Countin' on my higher power, I don't trust a soul
Put all my enemies together and crush em slow
First I need a statue, then I need it dumped in gold
Flyer than all that new shit, in something old
Fuck your statement if it ain't about a payment
If you see me make mistakes, I'm glad to see you've seen me naked
Take a look at how I'm living
Live my days like my last
Last time I was there
There were tables of cash

I get mine by the seconds, nigga

But when I do they don't notice the heavy downpour
Haters praying on my death, on my downfall
They got me looking for my shadow like the ground hog
It's get frightening, all you see is the lightning
Niggas ungrateful, bitches is just trifling
Can't be real with yourself, you're not right then
Different from everybody else, we're not like them
Need the respect gotta have the power
If I squeeze this TEC, that's a scattered shower
Guaranteed that it's gonna touch you
Hoes wanna fuck, niggas wanna hustle
No offense but y'all better D up
Whenever it rains is the best time to re-up
Niggas you wanna kill, family members is ill
Shit that you think about as each drop hits the seal
Crib paid for, the kids get a couple mill'
You smoke a lil' weed, you might pop a couple pills
Sharp as a Ginsu, everybody's against you
Things that you get yourself into is all mental
It's a lot of pain in my tears
Dark thoughts turn into criminal ideas
Shit like, where do you see yourself in five years?
I've always been a superior to my peers

I'm all about a profit, I pull it out and pop it

Make it feel chill like you need ya Pelle back on
I'm cosmic, I'm full storm from the projects
Yeah, it's in the air, you ain't gotta tell 'em who Nas is
Skies is red, winds is 7 miles per hour, light showers
Visibility clearly, no one real as me, cowards
Never speak to cops, only speak to attorneys
Had to leave the block, took the whole hood on my journey
Hear these niggas talking, who they talking to?
I ascended from heaven, I can walk on the moon
Everybody's a killer, guess everybody's a goon
Not every don is a don 'til a don walk in the room
Right? State of emergency
Autumn leaves, Mother Nature, feel the urgency
The reign, I rain hot spring
Nueva York, they throw salt
Kama sutra in female thoughts, I'm stalked
So I pray like it's Jumu'ah, it rains...

All you want is the shine, but the sun is on strike (damn)
The cash comes in then the love stops (over)
Ice in the bezel, that's a flood watch
Heavy precipitation (uh)
There's nothing you can do that could better the situation

Wouldn't care if I hit fifty-three cops
Guliani might as well be murkin' niggas
Cause the time that he givin' out is hurtin' niggas
And all these record label's jerkin' niggas
And you never was a thug, you's a workin' nigga
And you heard that shit right there? I started that
Don't make me put somethin' up in your Starter hat
No matter who you are, or where you from, screw all of that
I'm not tryin to hear that, son

Don't you be that clown nigga in the back of the whip
That's gon' get the second half of the clip
And all I'm sayin, it'll be da other nigga in the front of the da whip
Runnin his lip, wit a gun on his hip, feel me dawg?
Everybody walk da walk 'til they run into Kiss
Then, they get stabbed, or hung, or stung wit da fifth
How you think ya man hard when son on my dick?
Cuz I can get his ass body, plus front him a brick
Got a chick named Superhead, she give super-head
Just moved in the buildin', even gave the super head
I cop big guns that spit super lead
So play Superman, end up super dead
Call me Kiss, or da kid from The Lox
That'll twist ya moms out and do a bid wit ya pops
We was in jail, you probably won't get no mail
And if you pumped on my block, you won't get no sales
When ya CEO know you can't fuck wit I
I make a million by June, I'm sayin fuck July
And I beg you to try me while I'm holdin da Tommy
I'mma have ya body all over da lobby
I already helped y'all, I'm about to melt y'all
Tell the truth, dawg, I ain't never felt y'all

If it ain't Double R, who da hell else is hard?!

I make so much fucking money, yeah I go Forrest
These rims ain't for sale, bitch
This whip ain't for sale, bitch
And this Cuban ain't for sale, bitch

500 feet on the fucking water
Ten fucking karats for my baby daughter

HA-HAAAEEH! Yo
I'm just one of the five, I'm just one with the vibes
Even niggas is jealous so they just want you to die
They don't want you to rise, they just want you demise
So I be crossing my T's and I be dotting my I's
You on the opposite side, shots gonna fly
Best part about it, I can stay right up in Yonkers and hide
Keep a gun in the door, that's all in the ride
'Til my niggas come home, free all of the guys
This shit is all a facade, thought it was all a surprise
I heard of the stories, seen all of the lies
Long as the work is official, and the corner supplied
At the end of the day niggas, we gonna survive, what?

Can't figure it out or they don't wanna decide

Since you asked, I'ma hit you with the butt of the nine
Bullets soaking in pine, let 'em open your spine
Use your brain a little, my nigga open your mind
If you ain't in the circle, for a square I get you line
I know niggas is telling, I don't care about the time
Yeah I got weed on me, I don't care about the fine
From a hood where niggas don't give a fuck by design (Y.O.)
Yeah, it's real life, it's not a rhyme

Without You,Consignment,2012.0,"From third grade to the stage
Getting arrested and thrown in the same cage
I'm a little older, but we still the same age
Really the only one to tolerate my strange ways
Yeah, that's why I would die for you
Everybody gonna die
But, who gonna die loyal?
Sometimes I be wishing I could do that time for you
My spirits ain't the same, always got my mind on you
Thought I had the right plan
Up until the Feds amputated my right hand
The money started blowing away, just like sand
And whatever was left all went to the white man

Then I just bear down
Cause I know he'll be back, but he ain't here now
Damn

I ain't wanna do one of these joints so I grabbed two
I ain't have a good night sleep since they grabbed you
On the way to get your passport when they bagged you
I'ma hold you down, you my nigga, I'll be glad to (got to)
And they don't be letting niggas go
But if you never would've had the ratchet, they'd of had to
Shit that they been doing
Hate when a nigga come at you, how K doing?
Pshh, staring at him like a weirdo
Tell him he doing better than niggas out here though
Are you being nosey?
Or do you really care dough?
That ain't something I wanna share yo

Then I just bear down
'Cause I know he'll be back, but he ain't here now, yeah
Then I just bear down
'Cause I know he'll be back, but he ain't here now, yeah

The time is now, it's gonna be up in a minute
You look a nigga in the eye, you could tell if he timid
These fake rappers gettin by with these hell of a gimmicks
They act like it's all love, only love is your money
So when it's over nigga, are you a thug or a dummy, I'm neither
But I been hot so long, it feels like I got a lifetime fever
And I ain't gotta spit, I could cough and still eat ya
And fuck rap I make mils of reefer, I'm a man first
Tired of punching niggas, so I'mma shoot niggas cuz my hands hurt
And God is great, guard ya space
One hand wash the other, both wash the face
And I head crack so much, it's hard to ace
.38 revolver flow, its hard to trace, what!

Fuck that, pop off till nothing in the clip left (pop off)
Till nobody in his clique left (nobody)
Hole in the head, slashed or the split chest
If they asked what happened (tell em it's the Kiss Of Death)
Hustle hard till none of them bricks left (nothin left)
Stick it up till not a crumb on the strip left (take that, take that)
Make sure ain't a chain or a chip left (uh uh)
If they asked what happened (tell em' its the Kiss Of Death)
Tell em Kiss (THE KISS OF DEATH!)

This is LOXville
And even White America'll let y'all negros know Jada got skill
You a Jackass like Johnny Knoxville
So I can just imagine how ya pops feel (damn!)
And you ain't worth my shells
So you should just imagine how the ox feel
A lotta niggas is thousandaires
Walking round town, fronting like they got mils
For what it's worth, I'm one myself
But my strength in the hood outruns my wealth
But you still might catch Kiss in some Hot Wheels
New Bentley coupe, with the stock wheels (Haha)
Look how I get back to it, I send my young niggas to do it, in the black Buick
I don't spit bars, or distribute the crack fluid
All I'm really waiting on is for niggas to act stupid


To all my real niggas, sorry for keeping you waitin', (sorry)
It's ironic, but the god was beefin with satan
I love y'all tho, my niggas for even relatin', (i love y'all)
This ain't Kiss talking neither, I'm speakin for Jason, (mwah)
When you a problem it's harder to keep them from hatin
Niggas jaws is like laws though, easy to break em
If I wasn't on some shit, I'm gettin on it
Come to me with ya hand out to me, I'm spittin on it
I don't wanna hear what happened, matter of fact, I don't even care what happened
Might as well declare the clappin
Cuz my bones is old, gotta lotta wear and tear from scrappin

He Goes In Freestyle,UnKnown,UnKnown,"I'll tell you this much hip-hop is not dead
Change gone come just like Barack said
Money, power, respect, like The Lox said
You'll be the man of the house, my pops said
Now can you picture me rolling like Pac said
Do it for the inmates and all of the hotheads
Heat the streets up right quick, its all timing
Gucci everything, Sierra Leone diamonds
Tell you this much 
This ain't even a rap, it's a controlled substance
(Yeah, hold on)
(You can curse, You can curse)
(Oh I can curse?)

Head-on-head collision, I'm a problem
And nobody can solve 'em, I'm long division
On the road of success but it's more of a mission
They said I would be dead or I was goin to prison
Know one of them is certain but the other one isn't
I made rare decisions, rock diamonds that impared your vision
Even supplied ya'll for years with listen
Like I'm just starting but I got years of wisdom
Stripes I got nigga, it took years to get em
Whenever you see him notice his same peers is with him
He destroys tracks the minute he hears the rhythm
Not only a hell of a flow but his ears forbidden
And if you think this is a ring tone, yea you kiddin
Fifty thousand records sold, right yea you kiddin
It was his time to go he ain't care who did em
Didn't appreciate life and got aired for living
PCP by the liter, good cheeba
Sergios tech sweat suits, good Adidas
The jewels is invincible that we was suppose to get from them
Use to send them to the store, now we blowin piff with them
Nowa days it's different, I was fortunate
Cause I did alot of listening, the new era is missin it
Everybody three fifty seven and four fif'n it
Drug program two to four, three to six'n it
Feds send niggas way out by lake Michigan
Put the coke in the tires only if they Michelin
Never talk on the fone only deal with official men
You don't even know homie that put you in the shit you in
Gotta busy schedule and I don't think I can fit you in
What's good for me ain't good for them
No matter what set you claim or what hood you in
I hit you and I find you a wood box for them to put you in
(Yeah, and you don't stop, and you can't stop)

Yo, a lot of niggas lost their pops to the drug game
Other niggas lost their blocks when the thugs came
They knew how to box, ain't know bout the slug game
As soon the money get right, that's when the love change
Niggas know who to call when they want raw
Kiss is the cornerstone of the corner store
D-Block general, he stay shining
In the back of the van, 2K9'ing
My dope so strong its giving fiends the hiccups
Coke so high it got niggas doing stickups
Found out another nigga dead, light the piff up
Make sure one is in the head, load the fifth up
Play my hand right, baby, I held aces
Nothing on the scene but blood and shellcases
Nike gloves on the team, they can't trace us
Snitches in the witness protection getting facelifts
These niggas will never be able to fuck with me
Say my grace before I give em a buck fifty
The whole hood with me, they hating we all spiffy
Everything's a short shot, nothing iffy

Yeah, ride out, if I ain't got no money
How I'm losin' weight (

) HA-HAAAEEH!
Ride out (
D-Block!

[Verse: Jadakiss and 
Styles P
]
Gather 'round, y'all, 
it's goin' down, y'all
Block work, twenty-eight for the pound, y'all
If he the king, I put a round in his crown, y'all
He just talkin', but he pussy in the town, y'all
I air 'em out, then put 'em 
in
 the ground, y'all
Hit him in the church if he prayin' on my downfall
It's either this or you wicked with a round ball
It's a burial whenever we sound off
Hands to the no-hander right after the 
round off
Peanut butter guts, chocolate brown Porsche
Word to Spanish José, we was movin' the most yay
Had my boys runnin' and gunnin', sound like 'Coach K'
Listen, duke, you can shoot, but you know that it's both ways
My gun splash brothers, I call 'em Curry and Klay
In a hurry to get buried ever fuckin' with J
Ah, Dave, come on, nigga, I see you ridin' the wave
Brave like the crackers that helped hide the slaves
Keep talkin', I kill you, then slide in your babe
You got a homie up top
, I have him die in a cage
And you trigger-happy, can't wait to fire the gauge
Go out on your shield, or you die in a blaze
Gunfire
, one liar, 
gon' put the truth in a maze
I got the truck off the sour
, got a coupe from the haze
In the telly down south, I got me a few dames
We ain't fuckin', but we stuffin' they pussy with cocaine
Whipped out, 
fuck around and hop on the 2 train
Robbed the first and last car to show you some true pain
Wolf on the phone when I show you a few fangs
It's a different kind of hot, my nigga, it's blue flames
Dudes is startin' to get out of pocket; loose change
Hard part: tryin' to stay still, move things
Right before you about to murder someone, 
your mood change
We came up like ninety bricks
We had the city under siege since '96
Go online: still won't find these kicks
Like Frank White when he did the Chinese hit
That's it, it's us, then everybody else 
after
Our part of the good book's a rough 
chapter
Everything dead serious, enough 
laughter
Fronto leaves, Raw papers
 and Dutch Masters, 
yeah
You re more, you see more
They tearin' shit up on the streets in B-more
Some people don't know what it's like to be poor
The hood is a one-way, 
ain't no detour
You know the love course
, the hate come free, y'all
Those who protect and serve
 will knock your seed off
The energy is negative
, it's not to feed off
Shit'll cool down when we
 knock the heat off

Get it? R.I.P. Freddie Gray
Rest in peace homie that they shot in the back in South Carolina
Eric Garner, Mike Brown, Glennis, rest in peace, baby girl

Yall niggas fuckin dead, you heard what the fuck I said
I talk shit cause I walk shit, start shit, New York shit
The hawk shit, spark shit, the dark shit
And it been that way, fuck how a nigga live it's gon' end that way
Niggas is part of a game that I don't play
Never catch dog carrying what I don't weigh
That's three 45s, one 38, 173 pounds straight out the gate
I don't hate, got no beef but knock a nigga off quick
And I'm mad like a bitch and a nigga with a soft dick
Get off this, fucking with X, but on some other shit
Why the fuck you fucking with X? You must be fucking with X
Go catch a chicken, fucking with me you gon' catch a whippen

Un-hunh, here we go again - 8x

Look don't try to apologize on your two way
Sympathy don't amuse me, go get your uzi
And let's make a real movie
Play bad guy and good guy til the hood die
Toast yall cowards
Now I know the reason why Pac ain't really like most yall cowards
Im'a show you how to swing the chrome for real
Dog this year we gon' bring it home for real
What you wanna bet the llama'll squash you
I been had a white fan base before the signing of Marshall
Your  boy Kiss is thorough, hit your girl
Put it all up her stomach til she hurl
Yall niggas ain't nice ya lucky
So fuck it Im'a sell dope long as the price is lovely
And it ain't only the voice it's the bars of death
DMX and Jadakiss nigga guard ya chest


When is they getting off our dicks, them niggas is clowns
How many dogs you let go up, still getting down
Like 'face said, Last of a Dying Breed
For stomach and I feed still trying to eat
Lead by greed that's when you fuck up
Yall niggas gonna know when we hungry, you get stuck up
(What what?) What's up? Fuck a nigga yelling
Y-O motherfucker for real, yo 'Kiss tell 'em

Shoot to kill, stomp niggas out boot to grill
I'll give you a 
Reason
 why 
I'm The Truth for real
Niggas can't fuck with Kiss, I meanie that
Had to stop eating red meat cause I ate too many Beanie-Macs
I'm not one of them niggas and since you so righteous
Don't make me send your ass to Allah quicker
Niggas gas you to force your hand
Realistically you just a worker and your boss is my man

One More Mile To Go,Top 5 Dead or Alive,2015.0,"Y'know, you gotta roll with the punches (uh-huh)
Take some bumps, give some bruises (exactly)
Its easy to just give it all up, or just quit and say fuck it
Its hard to keep going

When it all seems hopeless, real hard to focus
Simple dilemmas become hard for you to cope with
Taking things personal, easily insulted
Doing dumb shit, and don't care what the results is
Ain't scared to die, but you thinking 'bout a coffin
And quitting ain't an option but you think about it often
Saying to yourself, how this ain't fair
You got the strength but the energy, just ain't there
That same vision that you used to have just ain't clear
The storm gets heavier, the sun disappears
You just hoping that there's light, at the end of the tunnel
Either that or oil money at the end of the funnel
Get a different mind-frame once you been through the jungle
But you can stumble on a hit, and get rich on a humble
Least now you know, they love the style and flow
We almost there, just one more mile to go

When the storm is over and the clouds have part
Keep your head to the sky, don't give up
We got one more mile to go (go, go)
We got one more mile to go (go, go, HA-HAAAEEH!)
We got one more mile to go

First the depression kicks in, then you get animal-like
Hate can turn to motivation if you channel it right
Its like you at a seminar, on the panel of life
If you don't reach the destination they don't hand you your stripes
And the work is just keeping my name alive more
All I'm tryna do is finish the game with a high-score
I done laughed and cried and then laughed and cried more
And I know what I want, so don't ask cause I'm sure
From a cloth that no longer exists, self-cut
Every time you look back you just throwin' yourself up
At least now you know, they love the style and flow
We almost there, just one more mile to go

When the storm is over and the clouds have part
Keep your head to the sky, don't give up
We got one more mile to go (go, go)
We got one more mile to go (go, go)
We got one more mile to go

And even if I lost everything, I'll keep going
And even if they try to break me down
I'll keep hoping for better times, hey
Lemme hear you say, ho
Lemme hear you say, hey
Lemme hear you say, yeah

When the storm is over and the clouds have part
Keep your head to the sky, don't give up
We got one more mile to go (go, go)
We got one more mile to go (go, go)
We got one more mile to go (yeah)
We got one more mile to go (we ain't gon' never stop)
We got one more mile to go (ha ha ha, I know they want us to)
We got one more mile to go (you know what it is)

All Falls Down,The Champ Is Here 3,2010.0,"One thing y'all know about me
I don't play, so just beware
You catch me up in V.I.P
Up in the club, that's my atmosphere
Because I got money to spend -- I keep getting it in
From the hood, so I don't play fair
And I'mma keep living it up, keep getting it up
Keep throwing it up until it all falls down

Break the P's down to onions, money in abundance
I'm in the lower millions, I'm trying to get in the hundreds
Niggas' pants too tight to fight, so they don't want it
You pay for somebody to protect you, so where your gun at?
Been there, done that; seen the coke come back
Seen niggas come home from jail, then run back
Singing the same sad song, my nigga -- one that
Negative energy stick to him like a thumbtack
Real hustler, probably sold a million and one packs
Niggas think they smart and nice, but they dumb wack
It's only 'til you crack they skull, give them a mum' wrap
When it's cold, I reside wherever the sun's at
Son's back, what?


Top of the league, 3-piece suit or fatigues
All I got to do is look a certain way and you'll bleed
4 words describe me: ""Niggas can't fuck around""
Fish scale verses: prices go up and down
Put it out there, see if it taste right
Young Jewish bulldog keeping the case right
Apartment on the 4th floor, keeping the base right
Jacksons and Benjamins keeping the safe right
First and the 15th is when we break nights
Bunch of red beams on your head like brake lights
Bitches that fucked everybody turned into fake dykes
Was biting the whole day -- it's gonna be a great night


Dice hitting the wall, decks getting shuffled
Nines getting wiped down, Tecs getting muffled
Perico in the plastic stacks in the duffel
Niggas coming through getting racks on the muscle
You asked me for money, I ain't ask you to hustle
The industry is hurt, they looking for the next Russell
The hip-hop cops outside waiting to cuff you
The Bloods is on Rikers Island waiting to cut you
Niggas on the outside just want to abduct you
Dudes turned they back on you that you look up to
Keep throwing mine in the air, I got enough to
And I don't like spending my money, nigga...I love to",https://genius.com/Jadakiss-all-falls-down-lyrics
Gov’t Cheese,Ignatius,2020.0,"One thing about pain, pain is universal
It don't matter how much money you got
It don't  matter how bad your financial situation is
Pain is the one thing that everybody in the world can relate to
You can't run from it, you can't escape it
It's really a part of life
It's all about how you deal with it
Them decisions you make on how you deal with it will determine
Just how bad your next experience with pain will be
And that's a fact

Started trappin', Mama said she ain't got it
Reason why these niggas wild 'cause it ain't shit in their wallet (Gang)

Drinkin' heavy 'cause I seen my man cap get twist (Damn)

You think you know, but you don't know the shit we livin' through (Gang)
Shit, I've been out my mind since my brother died
Eyes rollin' back in his head, starin' above the sky

The ammo, the artillery, the knifes I bought
Waking up sore the next day from fights I fought
In the hood cuz I fuck wit the thugz
Tryin to figure out, why the money never added up to the love

Lucky they get a Uber, I usually iron horse 'em (yep)
As far as the dope boys go, I endorse them, what!

Killin' these niggas like it's a sport now

Killin' these niggas like it's a sport now (what, nigga?)
Foul as a Rockefeller or Rothschild (uh)
Tailor made cloth on my body, holdin' the fort down

Evil thoughts comin', should I re again? (what)
Havin' talks with the Devil, it's just me and him (what's up)
He ain't never crack a smile, but I seen him grin (haha)
In my man-cave, watchin' CNN (mmm)
Yeah, I do it 'cause I'm built to
Bad day for me is red wine on a silk suit
I can make a call and have a nigga bring a mil' through (bring that)
I associate with the niggas that coulda killed you (kill kill kill!)
At the table, the round or the square one
At the clear-port, playin' cards 'til the Lear come (c-note)
Havin' money talks, too large for your eardrum (mmm)
Death penalty, that's when the needle or the chair come (Kill kill kill!)
Best shape of my life, check the endurance
Got the guns in the attic for homeowner's insurance (hahaha)
You know, preferably, rather the chrome for my performance (chrome)
Still murderin' shit, knowin' damn well that they on us
We like fuck it, though, what!

Killin' these niggas like it's a sport now

Uh, uh-huh, uh

Yo yo yo yo
Ayo, never will it stop
Handguns with double digit shots
I move work on other niggas blocks
Leave out the club wit a another niggas watch
Body that man and let other niggas watch
Only thing worse than a coward, is a coward with power
Gotta kill him in the shower, our
Beats is knockin, hooks is rare
Earned my spot, nobody ain't put me here
Burnt my block, I had a fiend cookin wit beer
Like the Bobby Womack of crack
Might see me in the burgundy thing, or the black on black
Matter of fact, go get ya chrome
'Cause I rather be, broke together than rich alone
Clappin em' down, backin' em' down (uh)
Fuck what ever happened before, I'm whats happenin' now

Now gangstas live, gangstas die
Grab ya guns, soldiers ride (show discipline nigga!)
Kill ya moms, kill ya pops, kill ya seed
Kill ya girl (Its principle nigga!)
Sell ya crack, sell ya coke
Sell ya E, sell ya smoke (you hustlin' nigga!)
Grab ya nine, grab ya pound
Grab ya TEC, grab ya pump (you bustin at niggas What?)

We Bravehearted, I had bitches tryin to poison me
Niggas who kilt loyalty
Set me up, vested up my move accordingly
I ducked icepicks and nightsticks by cops who rookies
Hard to be righteous, and when life can just stop for pussy
Niggas killin over hoes, guns concealed in their clothes
Bodies at funerals, touch them they feel like they froze
Speech, totally calm, holdin dead rappers dome in my palm
Burnin flag, plus its on the qu'ran, its on the bible
Plus America cause that every car thats drivin
Holdin the homeless sign you focus you know its Nas, the
Prince of the globe, leave no prints of the toast
Played with Ouija boards, burned frankencense with a ghost
I've learned, to do good plus erase the evil
And do what it takes to keep a smile on the face of my people
I was raised by the apes in this dark creepshow, but yo


Yo yo yo yo yo yo
Think bout when I splatter ya mask(yea)
My niggas is happy, ya momma is sad
If ya niggas is riders, the drama will last
If ya niggas a snitch, been judgin my ass
They said I'm too famous to run
So when I empty out this clip, I'm changin the gun
The realer the beef, the longer the clip
Murder ya mans, I'm gone in the mist
Caught his girl after dark so we talked to bitch
We ain't care cause the whore wasn't shit
Doll, I ain't takin the L or waistin a shell
I bring the heat like I'm satan itself
Fuck if you hard, fuck if you soft, long as you lost
Dick in the dirt, shit in ya drawers
Ill make ya grandmother get on the floor
Tie you up, then beat you to a pulp, say this is a war

Step on your toes, mess with your hoes, shoot up your mans
Come through the block tryin to screw up your plans
Cuz I still rob niggas for coke
Understand I'm the first one they call when they gettin the dope
I'm the one who prick your finger when they give you the oath
I'm the one who made the hit when they bring you the toast
Like Pacino and DeNiro 'cept they call me Paniro

Load the tech up and go shoppin my nigga
And I don't mean the mall or no Gucci store
You know what the fuck I want, bricks of raw
And I'm too old to make less than a hundred a year
If it means wavin the hammer and leavin you there
If it means grabbin your kids out daycare
Somebody losin a seed, pay or bleed
It's Sheek Louch, I ain't got no heart
I shoot broad daylight right in front of the mark
I put 28 holes through the icy car
Fuck around, like the God won't squeeze
If I don't see the badge I'm clappin the D's
LOX motherfucker, the OX motherfucker
The reason why you shouldn't cop drops motherfucker
Like it's something for me to shoot your pops motherfucker, what


Ayo the dope's in the rice, the coke's in the pyrex
Over the stove and I'm bout to hit it with the ice
Runners love to pump the bomb
Ain't no more fair ones, now niggas'll jump your moms
The god, minus the 12 disciples
I pop up, all you see is shells and rifles
If I don't like you, I'mma kill you not fight you
I bite a little piece of your ear off like Mike do
And everybody gon' follow me now
Down 8th in a new Z, mahogany brown
Faggots want you to kill 'em in a hurry
It fucks me up, like they ain't got no money to get buried
You could flip, I'll survive m'kay, motherfucker
In my block still doin twenty-five a day
Know you work out, chest and your back all nice

Ain't no benefits when you part-time

From here on out, we on smart time
The love and hate joint is different from the chalk lines
'Cause real niggas are built off hard times
The odds were against us
So either I'ma be a point guard or
I'ma sell hard 'til they pinch us
Senseless, they couldn't box us in so they fenced us
Now we pullin' off the lot with the Tempesta
Some niggas traded, other niggas faded
Some are still around, if you don't see 'em, then they hated
That's usually how it go though, the journey is for the chosen
Throughout it all, all I can do is remain golden
Right and left wrist and my neck will remain frozen
Word to Nip, ten toes down and we ain't foldin'
Can't say you're doin' your thing when you ain't holdin'
Movin' that water in the spring but it ain't Poland
Alkaline, yeah, I'm out for mine
I share thoughts with my son, he got a alpha mind
Long as he think out of the box and stay out the lines
He get a nice piece of change and a house of mines
Yeah, it's just work to me, that call is action
All these Bergdorf bags and all this Saks and
All this money I'm makin' and all this taxin'
You get the picture, I just gotta finish the caption
So Raspy so you don't gotta keep askin'
One head shot, so you don't gotta keep blastin'
Before you pick up speed, you gotta get traction
To see yourself bleed is a different reaction
What you want and what you need is a different attraction
End of the day, long as you gettin' your back-end
Before we split the profit, we puttin' it back in
In the name of Ignatius Maurice Jackson

Yeah
Icepick Jay forever
We love you
We miss you
We gon' keep this shit solid
Your kids are straight
Everything is intact
Believe that
On everything I love
Uh, in the book of Ephesians, chapter six, verse ten
The apostle Paul says
""Be strong in the Lord in his mighty power
Put on all of God's armor so that you will be able to stand firmly
Against all strategies of the devil
Put on salvation as your helmet
And take the sword of the spirit, which is the word of God
Pray in the spirit at all times and on every occasion""

Depening on the mood I'm in, I might holla
I love seeing niggas get shot and I like dollars

It's funny because my criminology is white collar

Bow down to no man, no need to stress them
Stand up and pray just to receive my blessings

I just don't give a fuck about niggas emotions
I'm well determined, dedicated with devotion
Never a smooth sail, it's rough water in the Oceans
Higher in the ranks, I'm hotter than you think
Throw the chinchilla in the fire like Frank
Money is a issue, respect make you much more official
But you can lose them both from a pistol
A nigga nobody is next to
There's never a drought, the joints just go up a few points extra
I was point guard, you was poindexter
Maybe the same cloth, definetly different textures
I took the base route, you took the pace route
You got accepted in, I got chased out
Routines with Sheek, haircuts from Safe's house
Dustheads naked in the hallway spaced out
I'm on a higher echelon
My niggas do pushups with the cards till the entire deck is gone
You already know we extra strong
And the AK is on the same dresser that the tech was on
Godfather, .38s in the restaurant
Headshot, so you can go an keep your vests' on
Money that you want to imagine
Snowball fights out in front of the cabin
Gourmet dinner with my neighbor in the Aspens
Or either in the jets, can't sleep take your aspirins
Next hot nigga or a has-been
Whoever is in the race, won't past him

Summer time in the coupe, only roll two deep

You ain't got enough heart, your soul's too weak
Probably scared to get dirty, your clothes too fleek, ha!
What I smoke, you can't burn it
The crown has to be passed down, you can't earn it
Shit that I do in the booth, you can't learn it
When the knife is stuck in your neck, you can't turn it
No wonder you need a point guard and a true center
You confused, used to be a dude, you Bruce Jenner
Sad thing is, we just gettin' started, you finished
I was chillin', gettin' dope money for two winters
Real nigga' what's the definition
And I do it for the hood not the recognition
No state number, but heavy respect in prison
'Cause I'm drop dead nice with the mechanism
Mob style street wise with the message in 'em
And I slap-box the beat 'till I wrestle with 'em
And told y'all before about messin' with him
He a G, I don't know why you're F'in' with him
Hit him with the double TECs like the ref'll hit 'em
Line man call his man in the yard and he left it in him
Say every real leader got a lesson in him
He do these right here with no effort in 'em

All I want you to do is feel me...
Why take time out, to give you the real me...
Uh, uh, uh

Ayo I grew up very athletic, hard headed
Thought I knew everything, wanted to do everything
I was spoiled, stubborn, the only child
So the only thing I could do was hold it down
Now this is somethin' that I could tell you that's no bullshit
I always been wicked with the flow since a lil kid
My first addiction, GI Joes and icies
After that it was light skinned girls and Nikes
Breeze through junior high school, then high school
Couple of semesters of college and then night school
Moms start riffin', talkin' 'bout how she can't support a grown man
So the God start flippin'
Pops used to say shit, but never to me much
Was like he wasn't even there 'cause we ain't agree much
Used to be gone for whole weeks at a time
Puffin' one eleven, used to roll three out a dime
Then I found myself sleepin' in late, doin nothin'
Fuckin', runnin' with the niggas that was hustlin'
Shop wasn't open then, niggas was workin' for a pair of Jordans
The next two weeks they was broke again
Me and K keep havin' talks of gettin' coke again
But the block was crowded we waitin' for an openin'
Meanwhile shit still slow we still flowin'
Never stop or look back we still goin'
Bypassed the demo to Mary then she passed it to cousin
We thought it was on but it wasn't
And we can't blame nobody
Look at us now dog, we came in the game nobodies
Double R and Interscope, put that cake up
And we ain't go platinum but we made niggas wake up
Got 'em all talkin' 'bout pumpin' the brick
And they only go and see papi to get somethin' to sniff
I'm 'bout to fuck the game up for real like in the World Series
Nigga that parachute down in the field
I don't rap I provide you bars
And the pain is invisible, but you can't hide the scars
So y'all never be on the level that we're on
Ability to have dope thoughts and spit heroin
I'm good just wakin' up

Shining like I just came home, but I never left
Most of them is loving me, some of them is hating me
Say he's underrated depending on whose rating me
I be destroying niggas on tracks, blatantly
Basically I'm patiently waiting for a vacancy
It ain't hard to tell, they all scared to challenge him
Money power respect, I learned how to balance them
Watermelon over the pump, the hood silencer
Couple hundred thousand a month is a good calendar
Yeah, they love to hear the Don speak
That's because my dialogue ain't in arms reach
Nah, I ain't with the coward ish
First the skinny jeans, now they wearing blouses
Don't ever confuse wireless for powerless
A nice red wine, haze and a sour mix
I'm in the trap with the blicky
Cigarettes, pills and the sticky, if you need something hit me
When it's popping I breeze quickly
To ya door step if ya copping at least 50
Never mix my feelings with my dealings
I'm house shopping for wood floors, high ceilings
200 or more on the dash if I'm wheeling
Really these niggas just mad 'cause I'm chilling
Face on the Master is mother pearl
I maintain 'cause I dominated the underworld
If you sick to ya stomach that mean you wanna earl
The moon and the stars'll tell you that son is thorough
I'm getting better every week
And I don't talk too much, the longevity will speak
They ain't selling you nothing you think its better 'cause its cheap
With the push of a button I'll get you wet up in the street
Its never been even, I'm one of the best breathing
Y'all red shirts might be ready by next season
And the spread is too high is nothing I just tease 'em
More celebrating this year and less grieving
But I'm always down for a funeral
For nigga hating while I'm trying to do my numerals
Screw faces, side glances
6 shooter, headshots, 5 chances, 25 large or 5 dances
As you can see I'm fascinated with the finances
Nah, he don't play
And he'll forever be Top 5 D.O.A., nigga!

""Tell me where, you coming from""
(Load up nigga, wooo! HA-HAAAEEH!)

Yo, can't really figure this clown out
Where is he from, Jamaica Queens, Cali or down South?
I could let a L.A. gun hit him
But Grape Street already told me you payin' to run with 'em
I could let a New York knife poke him with one of my throw aways
But I don't want to see no cops smoke him, uhh
Somebody tell Pa we ridin'
And get ready to auction off the car he die in (eBay)
Never we bump heads, since you like havin' people with you
Get you a hospital with bunk beds
Without Dr. Dre, you would just make slow jams
Come up out of that witness protection program
Hov' don't really respect you, get in your place
If B.I.G. was alive, he'd probably spit in your face
Nas was doing just fine without you (Esco)
And Pac probably would've made an album about you
So I guess that just leaves me here to get rid of you
And Rakim and them, they don't even consider you
Em know you ain't got nothin' for Jada
And I know he appreciates all the money you made him
It's two thousand-five, nobody fights fair
I just know an instrumental's your worst nighmare
But you tough and you bad, too bad, you mad
Probably been in your old hood more than you have
Yeah, you sold more records than me
But in the streets you gon' always be second to me
We was damn near feelin' you
Even though your career is based off somebody damn near killin' you
Shit you be doing ain't even considered rappin' to us
This is probably the best thing that happened to us
The best Wanksta, internet gangsta
Magazine mobster, shit on your whole roster
Get ready to say Hail Marys and Our Father's
Get out your black suits and hard bottoms
Haha, don't worry, I got him
He ain't a problem child, just a child with a problem

""Why can't you be man enough""
(We love it, nigga, let's go)
""Tell me where, you coming from""

D-Block, don't think it, nigga
Take a piss in your Formula 50, drink it, nigga
Get shot out the Reeboks nigga
Got shot and ain't shoot none back, you'se a biatch nigga
If I would've got shot on grandma's stoop
I would've had somebody grab my duke, right!?
In the streets they say, ""50, who shot ya?""
Named three niggas soon as he came out the doctor
And you far from a gangsta, nigga
You was talkin' 'bout yourself when you made Wanksta, nigga
Listen, why work out, cock guns on the DVD
Run around with cops from homicide and TNT
Nigga you can suck my dick
Come around without cops, shit's on, you gon' get touched quick
Cause, I was at the VIBE when it jumped off
Put fifty grand up, you pussy you ain't even lift a hand up
Your man stabbed somethin', police grab somethin'
But besides that, I ain't seen nobody man up
Shit, what the plot is about?
Cause you know that, you don't need a dentist to get shot in the mouth
And the hood hate ya shit, but you hot in the south
It's the crackers that buy the album, what's the plottin' about?
Many Men make a wish, but we ain't many men
So you gon' get death when we let them semis spit, what?

Matter of fact, I can do it 3000 times
Call me Mr 3000

These rappers need to take a lying course
Hit a hoodrat put her on a iron horse
Just remember, you the worker, I'm the boss
Little niggas, go to your room, and do your chores
I can get anything, nigga, if I want it
Make a gentleman's bet and put a pie on it
Treat the track like shit, and talk fly on it
I ain't watching the throne, but got my eye on it

I invented movie's matinee
If rap didn't that work then it was back to yay
In an hour like EP, MD, Yeah biggie the best, nigga, then me (and me)
And Louch, still bang you out cherry red M3 Coupe
Still with the niggas that I grew up with
Couple niggas threw up shit, Blew up shit
All this for a vehicle, blew up kids
Condo downtown with a new tough bitch
Best friend cook crack good and suck dick
Probably the rap nigga girlfriend that I fuck with

Uh, can't firm, this is wavy
Blowing out loud packs with the prince of Haiti
Welcome home to my nigga 80
I was moving them things, you was just a baby
I'm in the mean zone
I spit mean poems
For these mean clones
Forest green foams
The needle of a thread flow need a seam song
Hard plastic, blue steel and mean chrome
I'm no hater, you're no greater
I'm accustomed to crushing the bodega
Buying all this new shit, with old paper
Silk Versaces, Go with them old gators
Turbo with a white hemi, Grey goose, Patron shots of White Remy
Over the years I've acquired some nice pennies
Violate, So I could fire this nice semi
Suit taylor though, nigga, hand made
Your girl spinnin on my dick like the fan blade
Blowing like the AC
Been nice as Biggie days, fuck it we on a rampage
Jay to the mwah, I'll ghost you
Say good bye to whoever you close to
Always been top 5, now I'm in top one
Fly nigga, make a model with a shotgun
Roll a dutch, be happy that you're shotgun
I know alot of gansters, your man's not one
With the jeweler or the dealer at the lot, hun
And I get a lot of paper and not one's
Always been the hardest, now I'm just way better than every fucking artist
Everybody's a target, we ain't on a intake
Your girl sucking the seats out
I've been straight
All she see is templates
All I see is permanent money
Go ahead and spit game cause
You're learning it from me

They tryin-they comin' for my head po (uh)
They're tryin' to put pressure on me man
Huh, short notice (uh-huh)
Got sumpin' for them niggas though (uh-huh)
Yo

I'm like the Dow Jones of rap, my stocks is high
And it never was all love so stop the lies
Mothafuckas'll blow your brains out and watch you bleed
The same niggas that you trust, let 'em watch your seed
You got a dead niggas money don't stop the greed
That's why now I gotta rock my vest, pop my 3
And whoever die first, may god forgive
The nigga who lives, sometimes you gotta handle your biz
To my niggas when I die, keep inhalin' the lye
And come to my wake high, when your tellin' me bye
What goes around comes around, am I comin' or goin'?
All I'm tryin' to do is leave you numb, gunnin' or flowin'
I might cock-back the gauge, and start shootin' at 'cha people
I'm lookin for the devil 'cuz money's the root of evil
And 'Kiss won't be happy 'til my bezel look see-thru
Until I flood N-Y with perico and diesel
Catch me with the top, off my whip
Bust my gun while it's still tucked so you could hop, off my dick
I run with a few parolees, all thieves, that rock ice
Blue pacholies and rolies
At the mob meetin', keep quite when the God speakin'
Squeeze my joint 'til my mothafuckin' palm squeakin'
And nevermind who the lox'll sign to (that's right)
What difference do it make nigga?
Just listen to the tape nigga (c'mon)

Jay to the mmwwaa, hustle coke, ride or die (uh)
Kiss hand-wash money, let it drip dry (uh-huh)
Jay to the mmwwaa, keep cowards on their toes (yeah)
Kiss push the drop, rock the ice, get the hoes (uh)
Jay to the mmwwaa got the smash on the block (uh-huh)
Kiss got the labels tellin' niggas not to drop (tell 'em)
Everthing you get (uh-huh), you really don't expect (naw)
'Cuz when you Jay to the mmwwaa, you kiss to the death

Yeah, Yo, Yo
I wanna know, is the promised land heaven or hell?
'Cuz the niggas that made promises, most of them fell
If you hungry, then I got some niggas servin' the shells
With no sauce, and they silver, only take one to kill you
It's a small world, so you better guard your secrets
And it's easy to get money, but it's hard to keep it
Never been the one that like to hound no bitch
All I do is try to keep niggas around me rich
Screw all-a-y'all cowards, I consider you lames
Had to save my lunch money just to get in the game
That was back when I used-ta have a mean back-spin
And no mack-10, it was just bats then
You know, beat a nigga down, take his rope
Now we-a, heat a nigga down, take his coke
And you can call me if you wanna bye them thangs
I get 'em half-price 'cuz papi know my name
Call me, Jay to the mmwwaa
And everything you got in your livin room, I got in my car
'Cept for the bar
I try to put a little money away
'Cuz you know they say, tommorrow ain't promised today
Either bubblin' or strugglin', nuttin between
Or have a grimy nigga like me, fuckin' ya Queen
And the Kiss only do shit with niggas I know (that's right)
And the outside nigga can't fuck up my flow (c'mon)

Jay to the mmwwaa, hustle coke, ryde or die
Kiss hand-wash money, let it drip dry

Where I’m From,#T5DOA: Freestyle Edition,2015.0,"Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh, yo

I'm from where the hammers ring, they damage everythin'
Niggas' tell, 
sign states
, get on the stand and everythin'
I'm from where the cops beat you, after they put the cuffs on
Where niggas get naked after they hit them dust joints
Where you can get somethin' to eat out of the backyard
And all they got is EBTs, no Black Cards
Local bars, you can knock off yay
The sun be out, but the sky still be charcoal gray-ay
Shorty just tryin' to get his bread back
I'm from where they cop the new Jordans after they next pack
I'm from where they put forty in it after they head crack
I'm from where these bitches'll fuck you until the bed crack
(Yonkers) From where them crackers'll get you straight
Uh-huh, the second-highest conviction rate
Real talk, and I'm talkin' United States
They send one informant nigga to buy the base
Indictments, and they ain't even worth rumblin'
The DA just lyin' and your lawyer just mumblin'
Old head tryin' to put his numbers in
Yeah, my man got twenty-six summers in
Salute, from where they do a lot of wonderin'
Uh, he's a boss, it's a lot of dudes under him
Bunch of raw talent here, physically and mentally
They'll never make it 'cause they slack academically
From where they lack identity
Violation of the G-code is a penalty
Like when the NARCs take your keys and mess up your house
Handcuff you, find the work while you stressed on the couch
New jail, second floor, you the next in the house
When they first arrested you, you wasn't next to your house
Couldn't find the Forty Belows, I'll take the Chukkas
Girls from the projects, they loved us, couldn't wait to fuck us
I'm from where the suckers hate, but I hate the suckers
It's gon' take a mean army and some cake to touch us
You hear me? Lost Borough, but the heart is won (Y.O.)
Cough up a lung where I'm from, Yonkers, son
Ain't nothin' nice

(Cough up a lung where I'm from) Yonkers, son
(Ain't nothin' nice) there many places, but I'm New York's own

(Ain't nothin' nice) there many places, but I'm New York's own
(Cough up a lung where I'm from) Yonkers, son
(Ain't nothin' nice) there many places, but I'm New York's own

Look at you now. (yeah)
Don't let this cold cold world,(uh-uhhh)

I know your queen got her eyes on me
I got my eyes on your queen, The SMG is Heineken green
Mad thing is you know before long that we gon' get it on
My kit costs thirty and ten to put it on
No tints, windows clean - heavy Windex
Gears on the steering wheel, I shift 'em with my index
Real life - it's just in another form
Kiss of Death, it's about to be another storm
I'm a goddamn raging bull
Stay out of jail by just tellin' myself the cage is full
Got niggas on the payroll, just to squeeze
You're in no position to challenge my expertise
They get a bonus if they leave you

Boss of the bosses, so please don't violate or cross him
Or you'll be the corpse of the corpses


Uh- Huh, You know the word anger
Is just one letter short of the word danger, and I ain't no stranger
Never use a gat more than twice if you don't clean it
And never say fuck something if you don't mean it
And when it comes to life, the route you've been using thus far ain't working right?
Take the scenic
Whatever faith you got, put in a crook
Wanna hide something from a nigga? Put it in a book

There when they broke the pies down, they was baking them
My enemies, I wish them all luck, and I pray for them
Cause when ever we cross paths, that'll be the day for them
Thompson's, M16's and AK's for them
Can just get one, bullets like Frito Lay for them
Close casket, leave nothing but legs for them

Real nigga just to let ya'll know

Realest niggas in the game left
Realest niggas in the game left
Realest niggas in the game left

More money, same nigga
Better frame, same picture
Feds is watching, why they ain't get ya?
They ain't ya niggas, they ain't with ya
You don’t see em and they say they missed you
All the bad luck and hate they wished you
You and your homie, different casket
Same pastor, same scripture
I’m in the hood where the drugs is, never that far away from where the plug is
Homemade corn liquor in the tub is
Down bottom to its hot where the bugs is
Object is to rise up above this
Why you think all the real niggas love Kiss?
Cause the 'Gram got people so caught up with likes motherfuckers forgot what real love is
Check it, right off the back of the big 18 wheelers
As soon as I get it it goes to the dealers
They been fucking with us, I know that they feel us
Ain't too much to say 'cause they know we the realest

Air it Out,Kiss of Death,2004.0,"Work wit me
I wanna thank y'all fa comin out
Tonight
Dis iz sum reel' shit
Ah--hah

First things first
When a nigga money ain't right
That makes things worst
Now he's just breathing he can barely manage
And he's way past starvin
He's really famished
His right-hand man is up north, that's hurtin em
His cellphone bout to cut off, Sprint jerkin em
And his baby moms startin to do her thing again
She left him for a nigga pumpin e up in Binghamton
If his money is right than maybe he can diss her
But he can't, and niggas is breakin his little sister
His pops just passed
His mom use to be an occasional sniffer
Then she started fuckin with the gas
Dude use to be a star back then
He had the Benz CL something
But he just turned his car back in
Mad carets pawned all his rings
Took this thing next thing I know
Money pawned all his bling
Now he just like everybody
With the same old plans
That can't get over the hump
With the same old grams
They was on the block making fun of him
He slid off came back with his hammer and killed everyone of em

Cause when I come through clear it out
Play the sideline and observe how a real nigga air it out
When I come through clear it out
Play the sideline and observe how a real nigga air it out
When I come through clear it out
Play the sideline and observe how a real nigga air it out
When I come through clear it out
Play the sideline and observe
On D I go man to man
I know niggas with an asshole
Full of parole that go hand in hand
Fuck hot thats humidity
And you can't mix money with stupidity
Even though I get my coke from Colombia
My cars from Germany
And my guns from Sicily
Nothin personal but I was raised different
Hold my joint sideways so I blaze different
Give it to anybody fuck an age difference
From those in the world to those in the cage riffing
Rub the kite on your chest and swallow the stamp
At the end of the day they still gonna follow the champ
It ain't about being lyrical
Cause when I get in the booth
I make miracles and I ain't stared at you
But I'm in tune with the hood so I'm better than you
And when you see me comin you know what is better to do


Can't lie all I got is my balls and my vocals
And the only security I roll wit is my social
It don't look decent
It's like niggas left they crew in the hood
And went on the road with the precinct
Had it up to here with this fake shit
They don't even want a nigga to earn his
Just give and take shit
Just make sure you mention my name in da top brackets
And make sure you mention your name as the top faggot
Trust me this go around I will not have it
I putting niggas heads to bed like Craftmatics
How you think your man died
More money than respect
And it wasn't close it was by a landslide
Listen my nigga your work is sloppy
And I don't love them hoes but the purple got me
If I don't don't do it with music I'mma do it wit poppy
Just play the sideline and observe and watch me
Let's go",https://genius.com/Jadakiss-air-it-out-lyrics
So High,Top 5 Dead or Alive,2015.0,"I’m so high you can barely see me
Do you know the feeling of being so high?

Between love and hate it’s a fine line
So I stay parallel to the sky line
THC levels is through the roof
When you floating in the clouds you can view the truth
Hush feel the rush from the altitude
Looks down on em see what they about to do
So you already know what not to do
That Moroccan hashish is like rocket fuel
Yea sometimes it better not to see the ground
Yea sometimes it better not to be around
Always keep a couple dollars and a P around
I might experience turbulence when I see the town
The worlds under me
I’m where the lightning and the thunder be
Cause down there ain't no fun to me
With that said I ain't going back
I’m bout to blow a sack and I all know is that

I’m so high I can’t see the ground
My life shines so bright can you see me now
Ohh I’m so high I’m not coming down
I won't fade away

Rollin up tryna get folded up
How you gonna say you cold as us
Can’t smoke enough
Diamonds in my chain nah homie they 14 karats
Lil nigga that ain't gold enough
Staying on top while this haters praying I stop and
You niggas waiting on cars while I pull em strain out the lot
Catch me rolling that reefer I stay on that pot
And I’m always repping for my gang I know I say that a lot
Cause I can remember the days before I got paid
Me and my niggas was trying to make our way
We getting on fuck what y'all say
Made some millions and got niggas with me tryna do the same thing
I Make moves bossed up in the game
Ball hard don’t get crossed up in the game
Seen a lot of dudes get loss up in the game
That’s why every time you see me

I’m so high I can’t see the ground
My life shines so bright can you see me now
Ohh I’m so high I’m not coming down
I won't fade away
I’m so high I can’t see the ground
My life shines so bright can you see me now
Ohh I’m so high I’m not coming down
I won't fade away

High as the towers before they knocked them down
Teflon like Gotti before they locked him down
Word to the mollies niggas in popping now
But I’m just chilling just passing the pot around, light up

I’m so high I can’t see the ground
My life shines so bright can you see me now
Ohh I’m so high I’m not coming down
I won't fade away",https://genius.com/Jadakiss-so-high-lyrics

A lot of your careers was over (before they started)
It take a special nigga to notice (where your heart at)

(A whole nation of thugs that embrace this)
These niggas tucking they tummies and getting facelifts
(They still trying to ball) I'm James Naismith
Yeah, 12 cylinder pushers
And this bubblegum rap (is just killing the woofers)

Tech on the dresser,) AK still in the bushes
Settle it in the street, (we ain't tryna do court)
New scratch-offs, (bootleg liquor,) loose Newports

(all times) two P89s in the coupe door
(The dark comes) the sun go
(I try to be dumb ?) because these crack babies is gung-ho
Floor seats at your funeral (in the front row)
Get 'em the new Jordans (they letting the pump go)
If they could sell it (they could sell it), put the pressure
On, more than likely (they'll tell it), smoking

That's me motherfuckers, yeah the champ part 3 motherfuckers

All praises, all burners, all razors
Hands down nigga the game is all Jada's
Something hot drop I get 'em in all flavors
He's a dick, you pussy y'all neighbors
Yeah, two extra whores
I'm in the new Aston with two extra doors
With a quick flip I don't try to stretch for more
One hundred percent powder, extra raw
And I get it from Giuseppe, either him or the eses
I've been smacking these rappers around for a decade
Still tryin to get mami to sacame la leche
Know if I take her out I could pop her the next day
The Black Mamba of the vocals, MJ of the Pro Tools, anti social
Phil Jack on the track but I can't coach you
This is just audio of shit that I go through
Guns in the couch, money in the mattress
And I would have got the Bentley but I had to pay taxes
Settle for a polo fit and some air maxes
Your flows a light sprain, mines is a fracture
Uh, but the X-rays negative
You a coward, in jail you could never live
Nah, You barely living out here
Im the reason you Breathing it's like im giving out air
I got stocks in the block and im giving out shares
To niggas that don't talk cause they giving out years
I don't know you, you ain't familiar
And I don't care who shot you cause they ain't kill ya'
As far as the word play, I'm a son of a bitch
These niggas is decent, but ain't none of 'em Kiss
MTV y'all know, I'll punish the list
Them niggas' jewelry is fake and ain't none of 'em rich
Notice they keep watching 'em, there's no stoppin' em
V neck, crush linen, suede louie moccasins
They won't dry up but you can't buy luck
Cashmere sweats with the gucci tie ups
Overlooking the city my nigga I'm high up
And I could get your brains blown out for five bucks
Im always in the hood, thats cause I rep that
My paperwork good niggas already checked that
Im probably just comfortable cause thats where I slept at

Things I’ve Been Through,The Last Kiss,2009.0,"Uh huh. I just wanna thank y'all for takin' the time to listen
(Ah-ha)
I appreciate that

Yo, from regular TV to cable;
 
from bouncin' label to label
Just tryna get the horse out of the stable
Was once part of a dynasty, at least I was tryna be
Think it was the time in my life when I was findin' me
Sittin' in the spot with the dimes
Willin' to do anything just to be a Bad Boy at the time (That's right)
Then I rolled the dices, nah the money didn't add up
But just that whole experience, it was priceless
No free rides to the bank, on top of that
Was the untimely demise of Frank (B.I.)
Then the 'No Way Out' tour, we was smoking outdoor
Made 80 stacks off Cee-lo, that's without tour
Videotaped it all, I still watch it now
Travel the world, learned how to rock a crowd
It ain't much but it beats poor
Things that I've been through is all I can speak for

I can only speak for
The things that I've been through
I can only speak for
The things that I've been through

Now I'm on Ruff Ryders, Interscope, same shit
Partnership, joint venture, fifty-fifty, same split
Jimmy put that money up, two singles off of *We Are the Streets*
Then after that, seemed like he was done with us
But it wasn't over yet, Stout had a plan from the jump
Which was to come out with my solo next
Things a little better, these the niggas that I've been doin' it with forever
So I'm like whatever
First album dropped, promotion was hella
Every stage I rocked, the performance was stella
Had the whole world ready to Ryde or Die for me
And I wasn't even platinum, I was just side money
X was bringin' in the moolah
I was in the hood in the kitchen with the digital ruler
I can't tell you about the evil that men do
I can only speak for the things that I've been through

I can only speak for
The things that I've been through
I can only speak for
The things that I've been through

As far as The LOX, we all fine, cellar is all wine
Selfish for me to say Roc-A-Fella is all mine
'Cause it ain't, I'm just another employee that's on line
Trying to get my act together and do it one more time
Twenty-one gun salute with all 9's
And I know it's on me to make sure that we all shine
Fall back, let the weed contact your mind
Could find bullshit in any contract you sign
But if you from the streets though, there's plenty of loopholes to eat, yo
Once they let you in, you 'sposed to keep dough
But I can't give you the formula, I'm on it though
Expect the worst, the outcome is enormous though
Stay humble, still keep your heat for insurance though
Things that I been through to get it weren't norma,l yo
Yeah, this is what my heart beats for
Things that I've been through is all I can speak for

I can only speak for
The things that I've been through
I can only speak for
The things that I've been through",https://genius.com/Jadakiss-things-ive-been-through-lyrics

Rock a gold sky dweller and a thick Cuban
Gave away more hits than Rick Rubin

Before niggas sleep, they gon' camp out and snipe you
Wipe you off face of the earth, your face on a shirt

But not happy when they took my brother, the government kidnap

That’s why I get on shit you with and I vomit

Knee deep in the street even when its drastic
Them things come wrapped still neat in the plastic
All he doing is bringing heat to his demographics
Thank God the OGs is holdin' him
Short fuse, his complex Napoleon
You can try and talk to him but he ain't there
He done did a little bid so he ain't scared
Yeah, but when he get to drinkin' that's when he gets to thinkin'
Bout them bitches got him tweakin', baby moms is freakin'
Hustle all week to get fresh on the weekend
Now he going off the deep in

The mayor saying the crime slowed down
That explains why there's so many cops in my town
I done did so many years in the struggle, man
Don’t know how to live out the gutter, man
Them youngins taking over the old land
And gang banging done moved down south to expand
See all them little kids packing muscle, man
And they take it real serious when they hustle, man

Learned how to clap before he learned how to stack
Now he doing 30 something years in the max
With numbers like that it take years to relax
And its violent so its mandatory years on the back
Ruthless I’'m just tryna tell you what the truth is
He ain't even want to hustle he just wanted to shoot shit
Get high, get some pussy, run around stupid
Really a good kid he just always wanted to do shit
Drop on the jux, you can give him a quick call
But kicking it with him is like talking to a brick wall
Comes from a good fam so his books stay right
He only 23 he got a chance to see daylight, what up?

The mayor saying the crime slowed down
That explains why there's so many cops in my town
I done did so many years in the struggle, man
Don’t know how to live out the gutter, man
Them youngins taking over the old land
And gang banging done moved down south to expand
See all them little kids packing muscle, man
And they take it real serious when they hustle, man

Don’t be playing em close
Keep the work away from the guns
Keep the money away from them both
Keep it trill with your set
Make em feel your respect
No matter what you do never reveal your connect
Don’t be running your mouth, you know what it is
If you ain't never tell it how would they know what you did
That thing on your waist got that thing out the lot
You still gotta eat dog if you banging or not
Frustration builds up then gotta release
When the crime slows down the dollar increase
Hundred grand in the duffle, them youngins will buss you
And they take it real serious when they hustle, what up?

The mayor saying the crime slowed down
That explains why there's so many cops in my town

Cuz We Paid,Consignment,2012.0,"You know popes in the Bible they say
Money is the root of all evil
Need I say more

Staring at the clouds looking out the jet window
Puffing on the loud thinking bout my dead kin folks
I was always taught to let it go until the pen broke
Would the outcome have been the same if i'd been broke
Still going through it tho flow still fluid tho
Money can’t stop the pain it can sooth it though
You don’t’ maintain your sanity you can lose it yo
Tricking all on a coke whore or music ho
Business is all risky, at the end of the day hundreds is all crispy
Yeah nigga, I’m in that thing you can’t miss me
A bad bitch on her way to come twist me
That don't mean shit tho the pounds and the bricks go
Dealing with some issues that currency can’t fix though
Stressed out so we smoking that and drinking that
Meanwhile you probably looking at us and you’re thinking that

Just cuz we paid
That don’t mean everything is okay ,hey
No, and just cuz we paid, just cuz we paid
That don’t mean everything is okay

Death is guaranteed, sometimes it’s a warning
So I wake up and try to make a million every morning
You ain’t gotta rap to feel the way I'm on it
Hustlers mentality is still the way I’m on it
Frowns, smiles, tribulations, trials
Heroin in the bags , crack in the vials
So raspy tee ,snap back in the khaki's
If he got all the money why he ain’t never happy
If real recognize real , why he never dab me
He follow me on Twitter but he never @ me
New seven series wishing they made a wagon
Situations be real more than you can imagine
Royalty is something you can’t worship
And loyalty is something you can’t purchase
Going through it so Im smoking that and drinking that
And when you see me automatically, you’re thinking that

Just cuz we paid
That don’t mean everything is okay hey
No, and just cuz we paid, just cuz we paid
That don’t mean everything is okay

All praises to the most high
Without a doubt hands down we’re the most fly
Whole group and the truth nigga no lie
Chipped in first advance bought a whole pie
But a nat to infinity I’m just one third of the trinity
Top five when you think of rap
Now that you know you can stop thinking that

Just cuz we paid
That don’t mean everything is okay hey
Just cuz we paid, just cuz we paid
That don’t mean everything is okay",https://genius.com/Jadakiss-cuz-we-paid-lyrics
Two Curse Words Freestyle,#T5DOA: Freestyle Edition,2015.0,"Scared of pain so you fear hurt
I don't celebrate 'til the bodies near dirt
Go to hell they gon' tell you I was there first
Every opponent will tell you I was their worst
Having bad hungry pains and severe thirst
Have you earth in all black in a rare hearse
Hmmm, too sticky to let the drama slide
And the sight of the blood will leave you traumatized
I can't do no wrong least in my mama's eyes
I go a gun in the trunk that's Lil' Mama's size
That boy died from vocal-hicular homicide
The voice, the flow, and the way that he harmonize
Those that's real see the truth beyond the lies
In real life I'm living proof we on the rise, yeah
I was too smart to play with the dummies
Rather you kill yourself, save me the money
From the bottom, I don't mind if you pay me in twenties
They pop a lot of shit but as soon as you see them they mummies
Ha ha ha you guys is funny
We fresh as death they alive and bummy
Plug told me three words: supply the country
I told him that the bullets in the .45 is chunky
That's why they say you can never get to comfy
Trips outta town my lump sum comes monthly
Might as well all team up and come jump me
This is uneven, I'm the only one breathing
Everybody gets their turn, it's sun season
I'm only here for that paper, one reason
Nobody cares though everybody a weirdo
Dudes watching your back tell me who watching theirs though?
All you gon' see is the fire from out of the air hose
Stick-up kids get the desire they hit your ear lobes
Left lane all you hear is my gears yo
Crown been in my closet for a couple of years yo
Okay, enough with the foolery
And the costume jewelry
Ain't much you can do to me, nah
The art of war ain't new to me
Lil' nigga you better Google me
The city was mine after they said Big's eulogy

Feds in the precinct lookin at our picture
If rap don't work we gonna get it like Guy Fisher
I was taught to ride with them niggas that'll die with ya
Headed OT? Then bring some pies with ya
Buy your man a lambo and tell him to fly with ya
Or throw the nigga jewels and tell him to shine with ya
I shine
You shine
Like smith n wesson
 you don't wanna feel the ghost
Or the kiss of death n'
Tubs still lift up
So do the sink now
Pablo escobar shit
Buyin a clink now
Dead presidents shit
Robbin the Brinks now
100 shot tommy guns
Hell of a stink now

Cause the P will hollow the gun to holla at son
Muah, im that nigga ya'll know that
Do it Holiday Style
Double R is Comin for War

On the average day we smoke about a quarter
And everything is bad for a nigga nowadays
So we drink a lot of water
Talk about you so rich
Nigga you so bitch
That your parents probably think they got a daughter
Yeah we them boys that bring all the terror
We persevered through all the eras
Lay niggas down with all berettas
Everything in the bag--chains, watches...
...all your leathers
So you can act funny with yourselves
I'm in the hood with dope
Sacks is filled twenty after twelve
A sign of the times kitchen cook 38, 38 treys

Anything to do with the hood

Battin you down
Knifin you up
Stompin your jaw
Bail a nigga out for stealing something out on the tour
And they makin technology to try and screw niggas
I'm good long as an old gun will kill a new nigga
Yall dudes with 9 lives got one life left
And controversy sells but it ain't like death
So pop him in the head till his brains start to fizz on him
I ain't sell my soul to the devil, I bought his from him
Waitin on the day they say jesus is gonna come
So god bless yall niggas cuz i'm sneezing with my gun

Imma shoot back 10 feet

I think it's me and you tonight ma, lets go (Uh, uh-huh)
You see every good woman needs a thug

Go baby, you so wavy
And I ain't never felt this way 'bout no lady
Considerin goin half with you on yo' baby
Somethin about you, makin me go crazy
Know if I ain't soured up, I'm so hazy
Me and you on the same page, so amazin
Need your love girl, so many ways
And you could only hold in out for so many days
And, got enough points to score but you shavin
Hell yeah I'm anxious, but you cravin
Time keep flyin, I'mma keep tryin
Bottom line, I need your L-O-V-I-N

Lil' mama that's your place, keep holdin me down (Hey)
And you can help me spend this cake, right by my side
Ride with me, all I need is you right by my side

He such a small fella, to recognize the Mason Martin Margiela
What could I tell her
Man I swear you got to see her to believe her
Then maybe you could understand why I need her
Besides her bein a diva she wasn't bothered by the chiba
Zodiac sign was a libra
Definetly a keeper, I just wanna put her in a sleeper then fall out underneath her
Wake up, take a shower, then get deeper
Juice up get some power and then freak her
After the feedback then I could G Mack
But it's somethin about her love makin me need that, come on!

Yeah I made no mistake, right by my side
Lil' mama that's your place, keep holdin me down
And you can help me spend this cake, right by my side

Long as I got you, girl it's nothing
Baby, it's nothing - I'm good
When these streets, girl, come what may (what may)
Shorty, we do what we do, so it's nothing
Baby girl, your love is something I need

Yo, they say every good woman needs a thug
I totally agree, that's why I need your love (yep)
And I can't help it, if I'm selfish
Cause I need your love and nobody else's
Startin to taste it, pardon the bracelet (pardon)
Chance of a lifetime and I can't waste it
If being beautiful was a test, should've aced it
Her skin is flawless, her hair is waist length
Hi I'm Jason, ma I'm patient-ly waitin for us to have relations
Kissin me is just history in the makin
Squeezin and huggin I need your lovin, come on!!!

Yeah I made no mistake, right by my side

Crazy 'cause I'm sitting on green, puffing the lavender

The old heads don't give a fuck, it's the youth that care
They standing by the tree but they don't see the noose that's there
They telling lies to our vision tryna boost our fear
I get my hands on a gallon of that juice, I swear
Every time that a nigga threw a deuce, I squared
Find every auxiliary and Bluetooth I paired
All the truth I share, every booth I aired
Sometimes I go over their heads so I lose my peers
Work out and eat right so I don't lose no years
But I don't feel no remorse so I don't use no tears
Just a MAC-11, trey pound seven my (Baby)

As far as the ice go, yall niggas don't want it with him
Just for Jacob coming home, spent a couple hundred with him
Handguns everywhere even out in London with him
Might be in OKC he got the thunder with him
.45 ACP, you know he brung it with him
He don't never go over budget 'cause he under bid him
As far as connects go
Takes one to know one
You gotta be kidding me
30 for a whole one
Rather kick back, light a sack, and drink a cold one
Cuz niggas don't even wanna cop, they wanna hold one
Bitches still sucking dick, niggas actin funny yo
War about to pop off ain't over no money though
Something stupid gon happen the first day it sunny though
Ima have my feet out low shorts and my bungalow
Still transporting the Audi
No good at the line so crunch time it's important you foul me
Baltimore style, get yourself caught in the alley
Tried to hide out in LA and got caught in the valley
I'm just tryna get richer son the according to sally
At times I be talking to dirt think I'm talkin to mally

I done shot it out wit niggas
I been in the strap

Shits is all tight
10 hour ride when you could've took a flight
Nothing looking right
Feeling all alone
Thinking bout home
Being charged with a black pistol but you had a chrome
Ya co-de is scott-free you ain't even downstate
And you might not hear a word from him for a pound cake
Other words 5 years
Now you tryna hide tears
Cuz u gotta do whatever now to survive there
Even though the letters spray there gotta be a better way
Coming from the hood jail or death is the only getaway
You already locked up, options is limited thinking to yaself
Would you be able to finish it

So I'mma always be able to burn my strip
Cause my bags be stuffed and I burn my tips
And it ain't no tellin what the snub'll do
So when y'all go and cop vests cop one for your mother too
And I'm way better than them other dudes
But I'm stuck wit, what I'm stuck wit, cause I don't suck dick
Sat with the players and I stood with the coaches
And I'mma always be in the hood like roaches
Flow is ferocious, dough is ferocious
Two guns by each lung with no holsters
And I control all the fishscale in the city
And still make your first week sales look pretty
I come through, all you hear is chip in the muffler
And you could ask anybody if the Kiss is a hustler

J: I always hold it down, gettin bankroll in 4, 5, 6 in trips
S: He's a gangster
J: I always make the paper and the FBI got me on they list, that's why
S: He's a Ruff Ryder nigga, Ryde or Die nigga
J: By the way, did I tell you that my name is Kiss?

And I don't understand how a broke nigga could chill
When a two liter of dust juice’ll get you a mil
Yes I got loose ends, poppin out the sunroof of the blue M
I'm like Lou Sims
And I'mma make sure they hit you wit both shotties
I think this summer's gon be the most bodies
You never ask a nigga in jail if he chillin
Just make sure you make all the sales in the building
Cuz now niggas think it's all right to tell
And you could put out some garbage and it might could sell
Alotta niggas be petty and sheist
But that's only til you treat 'em like a video and edit they life
This is a threat, when I talk you listen to death
And if I run out of money then my wrist is a bet
And the streets said they wanted more Kiss
Up north niggas pop me in, and do a hundred more dips
CHORUS

Yo, whether it's dope money or rap money, gamble the shit
Trey pounds of Mossbergs, handle the shit
Got too big for the city, cops brought in the feds
So we moved across the map and brought in the bread
Niggas chill for a month and a half, no ruckus
Got the pictures of baggers and all of the gun busters
And you know how it go, cuz it rarely'll change
Everybody got a license and a alias name
We don't smoke when we hustle and none of us talk
Back to back til we home, we can front in New York
Cuz some of us is runnin from court
Smokin weed, mumblin thoughts
Tryin to stay humble for shorts
We could do this the mob way and kiss you on both cheeks
Or do it the hard way and shoot through your gold teeth
Stand on any block, play cee-lo and craps
And break niggas for they pack money, then give it back, uh

""Such-and-such was lookin' for you""
For what?
You're never gon' see me, you're never gon' hear from me
I ain't got no rap, no holla, I don't wanna conversate

Money conversations so we can't kick it (Uh-uh)
Said I'd never make it, now my cake different
Way I'm pullin' up, boy, you can't miss it
Watch on water, yeah, my shit drippin'
Rollin' the loud, she love my style right now
Man of the town, I ride around top down
High as a cloud, I'm rainin' cash on the ground (Cash)
Losin' them pounds, but pockets fat right now (Uh)
Rollin' the loud, she love my style right now (She love it)
Man of the town, I ride around top down (Jada)
High as a cloud, I'm rainin' cash on the ground
Losin' them pounds, but pockets fat right now (Ha-ha)

Weed connoisseur slash lyrical expert (Uh-huh)
Started off with that white girl, lettin' the TEC squirt (Uh)
The plugs loved a nigga, plus I knew how to network (Yeah)
I trimmed up a little then I tripled my net worth (Ha-ha)
Then the hate came for whatever the reason is (For what?)
'Cause I got the top down whatever the season is (Okay)
Came through there in that thang and they don't believe it's his (They don't believe it)
We gon' beat the odds then show you what gettin' even is
Ahh, my two mans in the back
They pre-rollin', you know it's two grams to a Back' (Roll 'em up tight)
They was trappin' the grams, I brought the grams to the trap (Okay)
Caught a diesel connect, I made my bands off the smack, what?

2 Chainz

Yeah

Man of the town, I ride around top down
High as a cloud, I'm rainin' cash on the ground (Them pianos sound like angels gettin' pedicured)
Losin' them pounds, but pockets fat right now

I Rubik's Cube with the blocks
In the same room with the cops
Had to move smooth like a mop, had the same move like a opp
Right now I use my jewels for a prop
Baptized the fork in boilin' conditions
It snowed so much they couldn't pass their missions
In my right mind, but I had the wrong intention
Had so much class I even had detention
This the off-season flow, yeah, I work on my shit
Come and be on my team, I average forty assists
'Cause I'm the 2 God, yeah, the 2 God, Mr. Woosah
Extra croutons, first bed was a futon
Now ask yourself if you're dope or not
If you could rewind time, would you have gold and ice?
I had three bear, hair like Goldilocks
Strip club 'em in a circle where they showin' box
I pull my joggin' pants up just to show my socks
G's all on that shit, just like my block
See, I'm a vet now, you a step down, you get exiled
Designer reptile, they tried to bite it like a ant pile
It's Deuce here, I do the shit for real
I told 'em Lego, maybe we can truly build
Nice view, but phones don't work in the hills
Oh, is that my excuse for textin' you how I feel? Yeah

Money conversations so we can't kick it
Said I'd never make it, now my cake different

The highway is on fire
Diesel in the doors, coke in the tires
It’s the price that you pay when you’re a supplier
The lord knows I’m just trying to make it to the buyers
Seat belt on, 2 hands on the wheel
I break it all down, it’s least a couple mill
Get rid of the weight, keep all of the pills
I ain’t gotta be here, I just do it for the thrill
A nigga waitin on me say he want the whole shit
Never spend the profit, put it on the whole flip
Those that like to gossip, they don’t really know shit
What you gross this year, I made in ’06
When I hit the crib, I’ma smoke a whole zip
Cause I made it back safe from another road trip
And I’m gone

Jada’s Got a Gun,Kiss Tha Game Goodbye,2001.0,"In the streets (it's real)
Shit is fuckin real out here (no doubt...)
Niggas be hatin', violatin' (fo sho, fuck it)
But you need to know... owww!

Jada's, got a, Jada's, got a GUN
Niggas, clear out, bitches, duck and RUN
Jada's, got a, Jada's, got a GUN
Niggas, clear out, bitches, duck and RUN

And I been had one so don't forget that
357 Magnum wit no kickback
Put 'em all in your six pack for a big stack
And I never keep the money where I keep the clips at
Violate and get you one in your throat
You still datin your heat, but me and my guns elope
When I die bury me with the toast
In case I run into a little bit of drama wherever I go
And I won't hesitate, make you levitate
Hit you with the titanium, 38, and it's featherweight
Bullets like good dope how I keep 'em coming
Kill a couple niggas then everybody want 'em
Who gon' shoot and who gon' brawl
If push comes to shove everybody know, you gon' fall
And I got mine on me
The automatic or the 40 cali, or even the black Glock nine on me


I got a gun wit 200 shots
I'm the reason you moved your family to a whole new other block
I got shit that could wake up the deaf
That'll knock down the door and break up the steps
Don't even bother wearin a vest
Cuz these ain't the kinda slugs that's gon' get lodged in your chest
Gotta nighttime scope that could see through the walls
So just to get shit crackin I'mma tear up your dog
I'mma show you what's dumbin out
And you could believe whatever I shoot it's comin off or comin out
And don't even try runnin out
Cuz the 44 mag'll leave your ass by another house
This is Jadakiss, I'm sprayin everything I see in my radius
The kids stay blazin shit
Which gun is my favorite
I don't know I got 'em all from the old to the latest shit


Guns and the sneakers made Jada
The bitches and the reefer came later with the money and the haters
But I'm a humble kid
Still put the pump in your baby mother mouth make her mumble where you live
25 years no felony I'm tellin y'all
Why you think I saved it, to blow a nigga melon off
As a young boy always carried a cap gun
Fell in love wit it first time I clapped one
Now I'm a grown man more mature and pleasant
And like hittin niggas in the jaw with the desert
And everybody got a gun, why not me
You gotta keep it on you now it's just like I.D
And I never seen a man cry til I seen a man shot
Fuck pride, bullets is too damn hot
So if you ain't got one then you gotta run
Handle it, or tell the whole world that...",https://genius.com/Jadakiss-jadas-got-a-gun-lyrics
I Know,Ignatius,2020.0,"Hey
Let me pour a round
Everybody knows
Everybody

Let me start this by sayin' that you're the one I want
A mistake ain't a mistake if you do it more than once
Like the pain don't stop, we been through it more than once
'Fore the streets could tell you, you already knew it from the jump
I'm never home, I'm on the road, partyin' and stuff
I fucked up, yeah, I know, ""Sorry"" ain't enough
Heart beatin', mind racin', Ferrari on the hutch
It's a shame, 'cause we done came too far to give it up
Three beautiful boys and there's a part of them in us
Cuts turnin' to scabs, and then the scars shrivel up
At the end of the day, my plans are to live it up
It's nobody to blame, it's just me, trust me

Nobody ever told me, it'd be easy
Nobody ever promised me no pain
Nobody ever said, ""There's always sunshine""
Sometimes, it's gonna rain (Trust me)
It's gonna rain
Oh-oh-oh, I, I know
It's gonna rain (I know)
It's gonna rain
Oh-oh-oh, I, I know
It's gonna rain (Yeah)

Ignatius Maurice Jackson, if you knew him, then you loved him
When you seen him, you would dap him, then you hugged him
Good energy, everybody dug him
He dealt with me when I was hard-headed and stubborn
Yeah, now I'm givin' you Jason
He helped me see the light in some dark situations
Bought hits, told me that only needed the vocals
You could feel the vibes the minute that he approached you
I was seein' money, I wasn't seein' the wealth
He seen things in me that I ain't see in myself
We built somethin', you gone, now I'm seein' it melt
And it's crazy 'cause the Lord knows I needed your help, damn

Nobody ever told me, it'd be easy
Nobody ever promised me no pain (Damn)
Nobody ever said, ""There's always sunshine""
Sometimes, it's gonna rain (I know)
It's gonna rain
Oh-oh-oh, I, I know
It's gonna rain
It's gonna rain
Oh-oh-oh, I, I know
It's gonna rain (Pain)

If you wanna go to Heaven, you got to take the chance
You crash and burn, oh, yeah
If you looking for real love, don't be afraid
That it might hurt

Nobody ever told me, it'd be easy
Nobody ever promised me no pain
Nobody ever said there's always sunshine
Sometimes, it's gonna rain
It's gonna rain
Oh-oh-oh, I, I know
It's gonna rain

Spending all these hundreds though, Smoking on that fuckin O

Fuck, the way I'm living is so different than those dudes
I get my weather from old-timers, I'm old school
Louie flip flops, Automor tic tocs
Racks by the ziplock, tell me who was this hot?
A made nigga with made niggas I'm way richer
He can't shopping the corporate flyer than Blake, nigga
Whoever, don't matter, can get it whenever, however
Whenever is not just uncovered is the way that I put it together
Life of a superstar, now I'm living luxury
Niggas call me bro now, really they don't fuck with me
Bitches call me bro now, who really wanna fuck with me
That's why I'm always in the house and I don't want to company


Homie I'm chilling, OG status
My pockets on swole and my bitches be the baddest
So raspy, you already know who that is
Came from the bottom of the hood, where the crack is
Sleeping on the king size Vera Wang mattress
Catch me coming out the Mandarin with an actress
Yeah I'm chilling, better getcha Nina
Or leave me with the money like Bobby Christina
I have your mom in the front row, in a black dress
Two mill cash any time all access
Told you I'm chilling, enough of the small talk
Sleeve rolled up, linen pants on the boardwalk
Watching a bracelet, straight from the district
Popping out the big boy toys, with a biscuit
Still down to earth though, keep it realistic

You ain’t getting no money, that dumb shit is senseless
I’m moving that dog food from Maryland to Memphis
Before I sold a record I was platinum in the trenches
Before I got in the game, I started on the benches
You minor league, I’m Ivy League, Princeton
I get it off the boat, after they sail them, Winston
All you have to do is add water, instant
Niggas'll kill you over a quarter, or 10 cents
That’s when your conscience starts speaking to your mind
Start looking for shit, seeking you should find
Up all hours of the night, peeking through the blind
Now you only communicating by speaking through your 9
Constantly waking up sweating and you’re cold
You don’t wanna die but you regret on getting old
Keep thinking whoever got knocked musta told
Either that, or maybe it’s a nigga on parole
Put them on to you, you get them all for him
Figure with you gone, fuck it, it’s more for him
Besides, he don’t wanna go up north again
'Cause that ain’t no place for a nigga as soft as him
They ain’t even on to you yet, but you running
You don’t know exactly when they coming, but they coming
When you love dealing you get a gut feeling
Feet above water, money above ceiling
Least a quarter million in a Damier duffle
You know me, I’m bringing the army and they’ll touch you
Light that, pass that, nigga where the hash at?
Bill Gates headaches, Scarface flashbacks
Nah, ain't no comparing that
Foreign attitude, so I'm wearing that
That little heart you got, I’m putting fear in that

Yo I don't go to church much but I need Him a lot
And the Ryde is Ruff that's why I got D on my Block
So you can't even get it unless I give it to you hard
And everybody don't get a dap, some niggas get a nod
I done brung niggas shopping
Brung niggas touring
Those with high bails came home by the morning
Kept niggas with Nikes on niggas lights on
Not on no sucka shit trying to make it right for them
Then you try to show 'em shit
The average nigga don't appreciate nothing so
All that shit is over with
Entourage light up more shooters than fighters
People that's there to work instead of there to divide us
No more royalties, lawyer fees
The less headaches it is
More for me
I'm a grown man
It took me a minute to figure out
My career is in my own hand


Yo, as far as the industry goes
Everybody's a foe
Only a friend when they want you to flow
I done came straight off the plane into another mans session
And spit pain and ain't charge him a thing
Had to make my line of respect real thinner
Started getting real hungry
I needed a real dinner
Send whoever you want, I'm kissing them all
Did a track with everybody except Mr. Shakur
To me a plaque ain't nothing
But some shit for the wall
And I ain't hating on the people who got 'em
I got a lot of 'em
But I don't got the money they got
So I ain't proud of 'em
I'm proud of me
Cause only I can get the guts out of me (what)


Even though I'm strong
The bullshit be still penetrating
It ain't nothing personal y'all
I'm just ventilating
It was starting to make me tense
How I put a dent in the game
And came back to make more dents
More than one hand on the gun
Just makes more prints
The older I get
The Bible starts to make more sense
When I drive by and give you the horn
I ain't flip, I'm just handling my business
And keeping it going
Instead of pieces, I'm getting the lumps for real for real
And get a nigga ass like I did from the jump
Cause usually a problem would help
And you always gonna need somebody
But all you got is yourself that's why",https://genius.com/Jadakiss-im-goin-back-lyrics

We could trade places, get lifted in the staircases
Word up, peace, incarcerated Scarfaces

My thug related style attract millions
Nobody is safe, no man, woman, or children
Clips, already filled 'em, head-huntin' civilians
Stay up in the spot, the bread comes to the buildin'
Wanna be hot? The lead comes wit' the feelin'
Hustlin' and rappin', two things I'm skilled in
Uh, yeah, the choice is yours, baby, pick one
Broke elevators, turn the lights out, stick one
Tom Ford suit on in the White House, sick one
You ain't never had a brick, let alone flipped one
Know a couple off here and there 'til the piff come
Other end of the barrel, yeah, you the victim
Uh, good deed for four quarters
Bentley SUV is on order
I just threw my thing, I'm a king wit' a don aura
Shout to my UK fam, D-Block Europe
All my enemies, every nigga that got tore up
Y'all want to play games, I'm puttin' the high score up
This right here is that shit that they need more of
Runnin' your mouth to a stranger, you get caught up
Puttin' your life in danger, at least sort of
Classroom could never compare what the streets taught us
Don't just watch me, nigga, peep all us
Shallow minds usually drown in deep waters
I do it for the souls of all the deceased ballers
If you ain't never wit' us, how could you be for us?
How could somethin' that's so tarnished be flawless?
Told you, life's a bitch, but she's gorgeous
Once you press play on her, you can't pause her
Rap's my house, tell these niggas to pay mortgage
Got work doin' the drought, it's no shortage
You know me, fuck the law, I'm lawless

Now, yo, yo, what up, yo? Time is runnin' out
It's for real though, let's connect politic, ditto

Yo, Poobs (Yeah)
Fuck that, we back baby

I ain't ask you to fear it
Mandatory you think about it after you hear it
And it's the evil that's gon' make you have to compare it
You know me, I swing back through and see who got hit after I air it
But it ain't about shit
Niggas mumble about my outfits
But I'm humble, I keep my mouth shut
Lacin' 'em well, it was destined for Jason to sell
I could make you a reservation to hell
Then blow you out of the water
I'm out of your order
Me verse any rapper is slaughter
Somethin' like a poet and a author
The only difference is that I make slick talk wit' pain & torture

One false move'll cost ya
These lames'll cross ya
Don't let the game extort ya
Try to learn from what the game has taught ya

They rappin' wit hostility meanin' they wack
But then again I feel 'em
Knowin' that they up against a nigga just like myself that'll kill 'em
Gotta spend a buck at the dealer for suede ceilings
Lotta bodies drop because of betrayed feelings
What other rappers you know made it and stayed dealin'?
Smart niggas just fell back and they saved millions
These are pedestrian bars for the civilians
Shoes is Italian, handgun Brazilian
Open it up and see what Kiss brought cha
Slick talk, pain & torture

Yo, I flip words around sorta like birds and pounds
Rub shoulders in the industry wit' nerds and clowns
Give it to whoeva deserve the rounds
Hollow tips move organs and nerves around
Get money, fuck riffin'
I'm definitely cut different, I twist hunnies, puff piff in
Get my insight from a O.G. wit' a good job and all that but he loves sniffin'
Shit talker, Playboy British Walker
Rappers be home like, ""God, please get 'em off us""
After the sunshine it gets darker
Yeah, slick talk, pain & torture

Aiyyo we four or five niggas with furs on
Up top gated up, big tables got the reserves on
Blowin on saxophones, the band is rough
So much ice on looks like my wrist been cut
And we just made it back from Beijing
Seen my jeweler, told him melt the bird down to eight rings
And the music stopped, Jada stood up (yeah)
Before the speech, he had everybody raise they cups
He said, I been in spots where I can't even mention it
""Don't drink the Cris', Ghost mighta pissed in it!""
Romanian dude, black down, pourin the saki
Face slumped to the side like Rocky
Then Strahan came through, with his bullshit ring
He said YIKES, when I pulled out my monster bling
Don't be afraid of the New York street talk
I switch gear all day bro, like you do on your peach porch
The chairs is suede, the walls is velvet
Marquise ballroom, so live I felt it
Fat asses in fishnets, shakin they pelvis
Playin with they pussy, middle finger drippin, I smelt it
Poker tables, crap joints just for rap niggas
Me and Sheek, walkin around bitch-slappin niggas
There go Rae, there go P
Yo Chop whattup! Whattup?

Sam Cooke writin hand, all of my lightning, damn
Used to rob niggas in Sam's, buy shams
For my dude's baby shoe or booster baby, rollin with steel
Eatin Jamaican food under the wheel
You know the deal, book somethin then blow
When from a O to a low, little apartment in Brookdale
Gold was my motto, lotto numbers is what?
Had it in me, rolled down coolin with coke
That's the 90's, Chef era take over America
Bag Ugly Betty up, make her Ms. Guerrera
Pinky wench in sweaters, cortex burnin the mic booth
Travel right past my heritage
Them old school niggas is me
Taught me how to read, get skee'd, everybody missin a ki
Yo I do this with a natural movement
Catch me by the munition (aha!)​, scope on me, fuck it I'm losin' it

AH-HAHHHH! Uh, yeah, yo
I did it my way, lights off on the highway
Greek statues on both sides of the driveway
Word to the stamps on the diesel
The way these niggas is lookin either they got cramps or they evil
One go we all go, D-boy fresh but hard dough
Cashmere and suede cargoes
On top of the beige Wallo's
45 government edition clippers, straight hollows
My Clientele is Supreme and it's proven
That I'm Only Built 4 the Link if it's Cuban
I'm a pioneer, I'm not a vet (uh-uh)
""Last Kiss"" is a French one, it's not a peck (uh-uh)
Movin powder, piff and a lot of wet
You're gonna die, that's a promise, not a threat

Uh, please believe
I'm a pimp girl
C'mon, let's go
And I'm a hustler, a hustler
Do it, do it, do it...

Yo, I'm a gangsta, cuz I do gangsta shit
Matter fact from now on call me gangsta Kiss
You already know I handle my business
Slay you then your man before the first candle's finished
Feel good when I walk through the hood
Best part is, I don't gotta flow I just talk to the hood
And I do alotta readin, and only eat pasta
Shrimp fettuccine, and penne alla vodka
Came here talkin slick, all that real shit
That's why I'm somethin to deal wit
Even though I wanted Gore to win
I can fuck with Bush though, cuz he gon let the raw come in
Bigger the boss, bigger the picture
Bullets is bisexual, cuz they hit niggas and bitches
In a Deville with dubs in the back on a cell phone riffin
I'm all of the above just listen
HOOK

Yo, I'm a thug so I blow on weed
Get money like it grow on trees
Have all these hoes roll on E
Some of my niggas even stole on D's
Work 12 hour shifts, just gimme the word
I get 12 cowards hit, never givin a fuck
18's on the Coupe, deuce O's on the truck
Tell P hold the hammer while I handle the dice
Shoot him in his bandanna he ain't gamblin right
I need a 360 Medina, charcoal gray
Treat my guns like my dogs, let 'em bark all day
In a three floor condo with the spiral stairs
Made it past the front desk, then the rifle's here
I'm the motherfuckin big shot, I get down
Wit a 17, 16, 10 and a six shot
Fuck with Kiss get your wig rocked
And if you're smart you'll bounce when my motherfuckin shit drop
HOOK

Yo, I'm a pimp, girl
Catch me at the bar with a bottle of Cuervo
Mami's rubbin my webbos
And this is what got me the ass
Honey said her drink was hot so I put my watch in her glass
Then she ain't even wanna get breakfast
She just wanna hop right up in the truck and get reckless
Top from the club all the way to the exit
Ask me her name, couldn't tell you if I guessed it
My bitches don't know nothing, don't say nothing
And they pay for everything, I don't pay nothing
I'm a white tee pimp, fresh headband
Dirty denim, Timbaland, or a Nike pimp
I like to eat shrimp, and I don't keep a broad long enough to love 'em
Now dog that's some deep shit
Cuz I don't believe in hoes explorin
No matter how bad you are, you gone in the mornin'

It's nuttin like when a thug get at you and spit thug literature
Your fanbase wanna get rid of you
Still in the hood doin it
I don't know why I'm doin this, we don't eve move a lot of units
But ain't no threats, don't stress me dog
You gotta let me hear somethin to impress me dog
When I spit I put rappers in line, then smack 'em around
I got 'em all home practicin now
You know 'Kiss be, icey hard and crispy

I'm from the street with a mean vocabulary contents
Whoever you send I'll send back
Y'all all been wack; 'Kiss is makin a strong impact

Dirty denim and a cinnamon fox
Bitches'll follow, gangsters'll ride, gentlemen watch
Buy the bar, leave drunk, shoot up the block
You might hear 'Kiss spittin, but after the show
You might hear clips spittin, we after your glow
Things'll never be the same again
When your frame get bent, link get worn, change get spent
Confiscate your whip - you think you a player?
I could confiscate your bitch, take her and slay her
If a nigga nicer than me, then Christ is here
You got somethin in the bank? Then the dice is here
I could show you how to gamble your money, handle a gun
But be a family man and go home to your son
Light a candle where you stand, cause that's where you died
And if you heard 'Kiss spittin, then you know it was won, uh


Yo, yo
Hey yo the voice got a lot of people heated, peep it
The flow is like methadone - lot of people need it
Seen it all happen before
Feel like I'm still hustlin; cause the way I'm rappin is raw
You could put your jewels on it
You might just see me in the lightning pickup with the 22's on it
The stakes'll cost you; understand one thing
I do great field work plus I'mma boss too
Loyalty is hard to come by
Y'all know who the streets is run by, could only be one guy
And that be who but 'Kiss, no security
The burner and some niggas that I grew up with
And the brand new 911, fuck a dime
With a fine eleven at stop signs I'm revvin

Razor work mean, buck-fifty the long rips
At any moment it could get funky as armpits (ha!)
When they comin' so fast that it fuck with your conscience

Shots fired before I could write a will
A shot back, the Boss is hard to kill
And I never wear it twice, lobster over rice

Fuck y'all niggas talkin 'bout huh?
Get it right, you faggot niggas heard Suge Knight
Double R's the only niggas he respect and, y'all niggas shook right?
Y'all get on Hot 97 and, talk wit a baritone
Wit two niggas downstairs with licensed guns to take y'all home
Scared ass niggas, you think they gon take a life so they can get life 
Ask Puff they ain't tryin to hear that nigga
For no cake, and y'all can get at us on Labor Day
We make stones that say pay ya debt on your moms labor day
I'm in the hood so we can link up, any place you think of
Handheld don't hold prints plus I burnt the tip of my fingers
I'm a Bronx gangsta nigga, double R's hoodrat
The nigga they come get quick bitch, on this hood shit

Y'all bitches think the Ryders a joke, well I don't play 
I blow you whole fuckin shit up like Tim McVeigh
Gimme the needle, not tomorrow, but today
Cross comin y'all better get the fuck out the way
I ain't the shit that you see that's on the top of your church
I put a bomb in your baby carriage, brick through your hearse

Tell your CEO, don't call my CEO apologizin
I'm at your wake in the choir standin harmonizin
It's Infa-Red the shit that be on top of the heater
The best thing in New York since Steinbrenner signed Jeter
Hold Camby sister the hostage, then send 'em a reef
So stop frontin vegetarian, y'all scared of beef

Yo, ay suck my dick bitch, the way this chick spit ridickliss
Here we go again, only we on Kiss shit
We comin and you keep runnin
You keep claimin you the best that done it
Pussy let me see somethin
Fake niggas screamin ""Ride or Die""
Same niggas we run up on and make 'em cry
Outta all the camps in this game, nigga
We the champs in this game
Who kick the real shit before the fame
Fuck you fat ass, fake bad ass niggas
Still play the hood while you ride past niggas
Coward trust me, we keep it gutter
Hope you stay mad a hater cuz you can't touch us, huh
""It's Time I See You""

Ayo, I ain't got a care in the world
Kidnappin your kid, maimin your mom, and airin' your girl
And like, you ain't got a care in the world
I'm hopeless and numb, I can't see but I can focus my gun
And I'm back to smokin blunts to the head
My nerves is shot, my paces is short, I dump in your head
I'm the hardest nigga out you outta know it by now
I'm the nigga that they talk about goin to Chao
And my name ring bells, my blade stay bloody
If you heard about me beefin dog I leave the most shells
The nigga to salute, the quickest to shoot
Holiday Styles, motherfucker, givin you hell

What? Like I won't run up and break your jaw
Like they make a vest for your head to stop the 4
I'm tired of rappin, let's get the mack and send niggas on vacation
Right in front of the radio station
Motherfuckers ain't quiet til the Tec go off
Arteries hitted, hawkin, they neck is shit
I'm the motherfuckin hardest
I smack the shit out of any one of your artists
Whatever the label
Y'all niggas don't want beef, y'all want meat at the table
And I don't give a fuck, Sheek'll do life in the box
Before any of y'all bitch niggas front on The LOX
What? Motherfuckers, c'mon

Yo, If I miss your head and your neck, I'll hurt your chest
If you from the streets betrayal is worse than death
And I'm known for gettin money, not known for wildin
But I'm real I could rock both phones in the island
This is how we even the bets
I kill everything you love dog, right now, even the pets
Everything got dubs on it, even the vets
50 close, then 50 wide, even the sets

When they start hurtin, that means they workin

Nobody gotta know who did it
Two-thirds of the L.O., where the X at?
Hoodie under the suit jacket, double-breast that

Lame niggas cuffin them whack whores
Use of the pick goin back door, no more for the fake
Just stand there and I'mma dish it back off
Might lay it up, might not
Niggas don't be in the wrong place cause it's me in the right spot
I'm quite hot, y'all niggas is quite pop
The record don't sell then I still got light rocks

Shank up (yeah) niggas leak enough blood
To fill a motherfuckin H-2 tank up
Getcha bank up (yeah) who you rank up
Get off his dick and get you a brick (woo!)

Fuck a pimp cup, get a plastic one (no doubt)

You need a gimmick, go run around the block with Puff
Get a Black Phone, rent some of Jigga's stuff
I'm like T-Dub, you wanna be dubbed (no doubt)
I was there when a lil' nigga re'd up
You ain't Willie, you just act G'd up

Yeah, uh, yo

In the glass seam bags you can pull the stamps out
Nigga the champ's out, we don't rock loud colors
We pop loud guns nigga to stand out
You know what it is kid, your man got the money in his crib
Then we gon' go in your man's house

Now we shinin' hard just like we wanna do
Grindin' day and night, so we can kick off our shoes
And there's the glamorous life; look what we made it to!
We some real live bosses, got 'em lookin' at you
We grind hard (oooh-ooh!) To play harder (oooh-ooh!)
We touch the stars (oooh-ooh!) That's what they call us (oooh-ooh!)
We grind hard (oooh-ooh!) To fight 'em all off (oooh-ooh!)

Ha-ha! Yo!
Twenty-four seven, three-six-five
If we ain't breaking 'em down, then we lettin' 'em fly!
Nah - never I, always we
I came in the game dividin' the pies by three
Then we got famished, so we set standards
Very similar to the +Ten Crack Commandments+
Some couldn't take it, others got lost and couldn't make it
We wanted to floss, but couldn't fake it!
The Hood embraced it, the rest is basic
No need to rush, be extra patient!
The new four-door Porsche is extra spacious
Same entourage, no extra faces!
Hands down, the best - no explanations!
And to the top is the next destination!
And ain't no time-outs! Death is the only time
We gonna sign-out! So we gonna grind out!
What?!


Ha-ha! Ugh! Yeah! Yo!
Top 5, Dead Or Alive's what they consider him!
Soon as them things come in, we get rid of 'em
+Mo Money, Mo Problems+ - gotta live with 'em!
Only thing they care about is what you givin' 'em!
Not the energy that you wasted in the game
Or the tears that trickled down your face from the pain
The time your jaw cracked, you wasted the 'caine
Had to do two shifts to make it the same!
That all changed, as soon as you tasted the fame
And it was all worth it, after you made you a name
Thanks to Our Heavily Father
We fly on the jet now, 'stead of the charter
Leave a nice tip in the front for the gardener
Do a lot of listenin', so we stay smarter
Everybody's a hero, when they get scarred-up
It's my ball - check it up, y'all better guard-up!
Let's go!


When we step up out that car
The whole damn world's lookin' at us
Cause they knew what's from before
Now we ain't hurtin' no more
""You can bring me the bill, I'll sign my name!""
Now we're flyin' private planes and such
Lookin' like a million bucks

Love to hate me 'cause you know I'm gonna

The party starts tonight
My friends are comin' over

I shine like Neptune, Venus, and Mars
In yo' face in yo' state, in and out of cars
In a state, with a date with one of my broads
But you gotta leave that bitch before she gets your dick hard
That's what shinin' about and when you get the hoe
You can tear her linin out, what you whinin' about?
You in the presence of pimpin', I'm walkin' while limpin'
And holdin' on the drink that I'm sippin', I'm flippin' the script and
I'm slidin' while I'm dippin' my whip in, out-of-traffic
It's so drastic, boombastic, this shit's a hit
Jadakiss, matter fact nephew, this bitch is a classic
Pass this ayo locy loc' let's blow some dope
Better yet let's go for dough, hoe for hoe

And I ain't hatin' for nothin', but it be so funny
How cowards be wantin' see me with my eyes and nose runny
I got nouns and verbs while you got pounds of curbs
And one of us got a place if we around the burbs
I'm fittin' like a Lego block
You bullshittin' while I'm sittin' in an eight-o-drop
These suckas tell me ""keep it gangsta"", but they don't know
When they ain't lookin' I be hearin' population control
Then I'm lookin' for a breezy with a whole lotta soul
So I can have a malfunction in my wardrobe
SIP! not the Jada with the Smith
It's the Jada with the fo' fifth, clutchin' on the fifth
With Snoop be in the front and his jewelry shinin'
All through his clothes and lil' niggas in the back on the low...
But I still shine though!

House shoes, Khakis, tee shirts, I adapt to my surroundings

City lab a-fitted, that's when I'm back in the town and
Don't get it confused I'm proud to be gone
Be home in a year with duffle bags out on the lawn
So much money my niggas keep countin' it wrong
So many hits I can't keep count of the songs
And we still grindin', stainless steel nine and

Found out another nigga dead light the piff up,make sure one is in the head load the fifth up(every verse deserves a pullback 3x)
Play my hand right babe I held aces
None on the scene but blood and shell cases
Nike gloves on the team they can't trace us
Snitches on the witness protection getting facelifts
These niggas would never be able to fuck with me
Say my grave before I give em a buck 50
Whole hood with me they hating be on spiffy
Everything is a short shot none iffy
Feel dancing with the devil on occasions
My delivery is incredible and amazing
Listen when ain't selling records am sellinq haze in
Bout to have the sour and the kush in a couple dayz in
Back to these faggot ass industry niggas, everybody consider yourself enemy niggas
Headshot same way it did Kennedy niggas

Everyday is a struggle, we all hustle & we grind

Do your history & find out
Kiss will be the last representative of authenticity
Officially, came in the game nice, initially
Money & respect over fame & publicity
Sicker than the sycamore tree burning piffery
Know they say ""Ain't nothing sweeter than a victory""
Mob like I'm from the West side of Sicily
A true lyricist, I am the epitome
Typically speaking or just speaking typically
If rap is a cologne you niggas couldn’t get a whiff of me
I dare one of you chumps beg to differ me
Your forehead's where the back of the .45’s will be
This ain't an art or craft, this is a gift to me
I’ve run right through em, just send the list to me
Smoke like hickory, unsolved lyrical homocide is a mystery

Look here: stay on your grind
Everyday is a struggle, we all hustle and we grind
Lil bruh, get yours, come on stay on your grind
Only the strong survive you know we ride until we grind

In the hood, it’s a different kind of love
Cause if you create a spark you can get yourself a plug
Some niggas turn it down, but some niggas turn it up
Hit the highway and burn it up
Trunk full of white shit, dayshift, nightshift
And I’m dead wrong but my kids need the right shit
All that and them some
Get your hands on the work, then give your men some
Generate some income, save some, spend some, lose some, win some
Fuck it, rent something until the Benz come
Never associate with the frail dudes
Cause time is money and weight make the scale move
Take a great white shark to make a whale move
Separate all the marks from all the real dudes
Little something on your wrist to tell the time
But whatever you do, don’t ever get off your grind


Probably sold every drug on the menu
Cause the thugging is in you but the struggle continues
Always bring it the same way, no matter the venue
And keep it brief with niggas cause they’ll try to spend you
The love goes by quick but the hurt's long
Rich niggas smile, broke niggas get their smirk on
And I’ll admit I gotta lot of shit to work on
But now I’m in the spot till the work's gone",https://genius.com/Jadakiss-grind-lyrics

Yeah, I'm just doin' my 1, 2 and shit
She's shakin it, doin' that St. Louis shit
With her back in it,
 so I put my bones in it
The Rose gold prezzie got the pink stones in it
Why you want drama with me, I ain't gon' blast you
Before I put the money on ya head I'ma ask you, nigga

Wow, what you so mad at now?
Go get yourself a drink, let's all get down
Roll somethin', smoke somethin' let's blow this pound
Know if somethin' jump off we gon' hold this down
Wow, what you so mad at now?
Go get yourself a drink, let's all get down
Roll somethin', smoke somethin' let's blow this pound
Know if somethin' jump off we gon' hold this down

Yo yo yo
I'm everything controversial
Underground, gangsta rap slash commercial
Ya but still all it takes is a long dutch
For me to get your wifey up out of her 
Von Dutch
As far as the funeral, we got it, its on us
Niggas ain't crazy, they just on dust
So let me get another round
Now Hypno and Clico will sit a brother down
Haze'll have you feelin' like you in another town
Then its time for the gangstas so get the rubbers now
K I two of them swirled things
One more drink and ya boy might be doin the earl thing
Ma, it's me, you and whoever ya girl bring
Meet me in the back, I'm outside the pearl thing
I got the trey pound hooked on my waist
When they mention my name around other rappers
Look in they face and say

Wow, what you so mad at now?
Go get yourself a drink, let's all get down
Roll somethin', smoke somethin' let's blow this pound
Know if somethin' jump off we gon' hold this down
Wow, what you so mad at now?
Go get yourself a drink, let's all get down
Roll somethin', smoke somethin' let's blow this pound
Know if somethin' jump off we gon' hold this down

Can't knock a nigga that didn't make it if he tried
Far as me though, my spot is solidified so when I hit my number
I'ma hit it high and when I'm dead and gone
They gonna say I did it live
'Cause I done been too nice for way too long
They can't hold me back I'm way too strong
Double R and D-Block
That's what it is and that's what its gonna be
We gettin' it on, I just wanna know

Wow, what you so mad at now?
Go get yourself a drink, let's all get down
Roll somethin', smoke somethin' let's blow this pound
Know if somethin' jump off we gon' hold this down

Hood rich, I could light the stove wit a new face
And as far for feds, they gon have to get me at the top
When you see me, you betta ride if you got the drop
Cuz I stay wit the magnum, the 3-5-7
And, I can get the diesel, own T by 11
If you wanna do the math, don't come back til' you sold every gram for a hundred and a half
Uh, keep up if you could follow the verse
And I never seen a brink truck follow a hearse
So that's why I'm an inforcer, the coop is V-10 five point five with five hundred horses
Before long, I'm gonna catch ya

You'll be after equity now, my checks look like destiny child's

From Now Till Then,UnKnown,UnKnown,":
Niggas broke off some rabbits
Went up north with habits
And then turn from boss to average
Can't afford, then you ain't got what it cost to have it
When a love of a family members' loss its tragic
Digging in my pocket tryna find a knot
Moved a little minor rock
Cause they was only scrapping on a minor block
Playing in the building, Transforming pain into millions
Off dimes of chocolate, What a feeling
High-top harlems with the strap still on em
No baggies, capsules, wrestlin' and slap skills
Everybody bussed it
Fried baloney sandwich with the mustard
Shit, either you ate or you flushed it
Think about it those were the best days
On the phone with shorty
While you ironing your clothes for the next day
Lunch money turned into pack money, Dudes I was cool with starting to act funny
Honeys wanna hit, So they starting to scrap for me
Imagine what its gonna be when I get this rap money
Looking up to whoever was known for cooking up
You could be taken in, or you could be tooken up
Stand firm like a man , Never get shooken up
Swear you can make it my nigga...Just look at us
What goes around comes around again
Know the same rule applies from now till then
:
Yo... Now its getting spooky
It switched to the Acura, Integs and Suzuki's
'Lotta Ninos and Pookies
Dapper Dan... Silks and Bally's
Ropes Dookie
Whoever was in office was letting it flow loosely
Sent crack, Some niggas came home then went back
Thugged out, shit wasn't the same so they bugged out
I don't wanna rush into it
Looking at my uncles and cousins do it
Thinking to myself, ""There's nothing to it""
Now I gotta pager, And the minor rock turned major
Cause the fiends is looking for the flavor
Nice little run with the crew, Money wasn't coming fast as i wanted it to
So I fell back, Took a deep breath
Inhaled rap, Waited for a spot to open up and held that
Even tho, it's still a lotta bumps in the road yo'
Everything is well-earned, Nothing is old though
Think about it, while cleaning and loading the 4-4
Reality is, Death is convienent to most folks
The torch is lit, And me? I'm just fortunate
To be in it for this long still scorching shit
Every verse is food, Every song is dinner
I belong with winners, Only the strongest finish
So you could be cool or you can wild till the end
But the same rules apply, From now till then",https://genius.com/Jadakiss-from-now-till-then-lyrics
Nasty Girl,Kiss Tha Game Goodbye,2001.0,"C'mon
I need a good girl
I need a good girl
I need a good girl

Eyes all chinky
She be coming through in the new Cadillac Escalade on twinkies
Ma got a perfect face, brilliant ass
Her hands and her feet look like a mill in cash
I love when I call and she still in class
Instead of down in Bloomingdales stealing bags
And you know ya man Jada shoot through the hood
She look so good that the chickenheads can't hate her
Ever seen a dime? she a hell-a one
Still make her hop out and cop me a dutch, a vanilla one
Taught her how to murda the highway
Put her up on mean shoes like Roberto Cavale`
Even though she look real ill in the Gucci
Now you might catch her in Emilio Pucci
Since she a good girl that attend college
I don't let her give me brain I just let her give me knowledge

She's a good, good, good, good girl
Such a real fine lady and a lucky girl
I don't want no nasty girl
I don't want no nasty girl

I'mma show you the Kiss of Life sorta like Sade
G-class 5, the seats go sideways
Wit the see-through roof, OOF!
Rims so big they leave dents in the highway
My good girl ride wit me
She take over the wheel everytime I pull over to piss
She shake it up in the club when I'm over them hips
Waking up to the turkey bacon over the grits
Orange juice and the newspaper over the clips
Later on she gon hook up spaghetti
She ain't worried 'bout Hermes shit she got it already
She said she knew about the game cause her father was heavy
Then she asked could she borrow the Chevy
I could zoom in the jag
She going shopping need room for the bags
I sped off in the joint like it's Raspy's world
Cause (I don't want no nasty girl}


She's a good girl, I love her for that
She got mad dough, I love her for that
Her moms is cool, I think her lil' brother a rat
Everything else is straight though other than that
She dont play no games, I love her for that
Or hang wit no dames, I love her for that
I told her roll for dolo, leave the chicks
Attitude, reflex leadership
And the sex is incredible, I love her for that
How she fit me in her schedule, I love her for that
And she like making love by the lake for hours
Or just chillin' on the block, on a crate for hours
This Jadakiss, and Timbaland
This is Raspy's world
And I don't want no nasty girl",https://genius.com/Jadakiss-nasty-girl-lyrics
Still Grind’n,#T5DOA: Freestyle Edition,2015,"(This is the remix)

Look here and stay on your grind
Everyday is a struggle, we all hustle and we grind
(Looking mad at me for? Get on your grind, nigga)

I got a different kind of mind,  I'm a different kind of sign
I'ma Libra but my hustle is a billion dollar grind
I don't moved a lot of weight, got money every state
I'm sorry I've been too busy to notice if you hate
Why your money never up, why ain't no liquor in your cup
You ain't buy it but when I see you, you always lighting up
You a roach, fuck first class
Be happy in this coach, we the same
Just me and you ain't take the same approach
I don't buy nothing cheap and I don't even roll deep
I get money night and day so I don't get a lot of sleep
Gotta let the nigga know, every time you work the pole
She ain't a hoe cause she stripping nigga, she grinding for her dough
We did it on our own, they ain't throw the LOX a bone
I'm just not given grown man loan
That's the shit I can't condone
16 in my chrome, loyalty is hard to find
LOX and D-Block stay on our grind

Look here: stay on your grind
Everyday is a struggle, we all hustle and we grind
Lil bruh, get yours, come on stay on your grind
Only the strong survive you know we ride until we grind

Sell what you gotta sell
Get back up though you might of fell
Think about it, get a drink, light a L
Go harder, you might as well
If the decision is yours, how you decide the trail
Either you receiving the letters or you provide the mail
You're nothing on the streets but the man in the jail
Elbow grease, that's hammer to nail
If you fail the plan, then you planning to fail
The horror is similar to Amityville
A real hustler gonna grind cause he can and he will
Tryna do whatever to put an end to these bills
Y'all already know that the trinity's trill
I just wanna know how infinity feels
You knew what it was when you entered the realm
Pay attention all the way to the end of the film
And I'ma stay on my grind and continue to kill

Grind
Everyday is a struggle, we all hustle and we grind
Lil bruh, get yours, come on stay on your grind
Only the strong survive you know we ride until we grind

Stay on your grind, money is on my mind
The plug is on my line
But we don't say a place, just a time
I don't 
Half in concern cause I'm smart and my arm is strong
Got shooters that'll ride
You wanna know the shooters, well it's me, myself, and I
And that's as far as it's gon' go on this info I provide
Cause I never been a snitch and I never been a snake
Anytime I had beef, I ain't never went to Jake
Always been a real nigga, I ain't never been a fake
They said I was a  that it wasn't in my face
Stay on your grind, niggas stay off the swan
I see you in the park in the morning like nine
Or maybe it was Megatron
 depending on
Stay on your grind, nigga I'm on mine
Rolex tell the time
It's D-Block set til we die

Grind
Everyday is a struggle, we all hustle and we grind
Lil bruh, get yours, come on stay on your grind
Only the strong survive you know we ride until we grind",https://genius.com/Jadakiss-still-grindn-lyrics

Diabolical word play
It's only the mixtape ladies and gentleman
Sour and chambers, my nigga, save your applauses
(Green Lantern drop that shit)
:
This is for the black ra-dio, niggas that play C-lo
Always on the d-low, with dreams of a kilo
It's nice if Jordan hit the jumper on Craig Ehlo
Show a stranger love hate on a brother we know
A lot of niggas got killed because of their ego
Either over a bitch or a couple of c-notes
It's rough in the g-h-e-t-t-o
Got to learn how to hear no evil and see no
I spit nothing but acid like amino
Still good for your skin though like aveeno
Honeys be amazed how my Hershey kiss ring glow
Miss being with my grandmother playing bingo
Whole album is crack not just the singles
Its garbage if u put it on your tongue and it don't tingle
I still be in the hood nigga I let the thing go
Bullets gone burn but the razor gone sting though
Do this for niggas in Coxsackie in a swing yo
Got a team out in Louisville like Patino
Kill you in 88 minutes like Pacino
Connects show me how to play dominos and pokeno
21 nigga I'm robbing all the casinos
Name ring bells from Rikers Island to Chino
Little niggas with choppers hopping out the Camino
Who ever didn't get hit evacuated the scene yo
You know that I don't fuck around let your team know
Or one day when you’re out of town I'll let your queen know
I mean what I say, and I say what I mean yo
Send you to the hospital first then your spleen yo
And I ain't trying get funny money I need mean dough
Niggas can't fuck with the God come clean yo
I shit on niggas dreams yo, kiss my ass

This is for the black iPid-od, niggas who still kid-ar
Those up north in the yard on the bid-ar
Whoever throw a 50 of weed in they cigar
Couldn’t except when the Jets got Brett Fid-ar
True New Yorker need money like A-Rid-ar
Get out of ya place and your face a get skid-ar
Use to blow weed with Big out of the jid-ar
Ya man could get pluck like a string on the guitar
You could be this year’s bird and get killed-off
If I'm on the road it's me busy and hit hard
Real ironic that I get busy and hit hard
Hop in the big ass van and drive fiz-ar
Real hood nigga so never call me a stiz-ar
More like the sun and the moon ask the giz-ard
Can't understand tight jeans big skid-ars
Niggas look half way gay mad bizarre
Buck shot daily I'm up in the juice bizz-ar
Nice on the mic like Cool G, Kane, and Izzard
4-4 bulldog I’m knocking a nigga rib off
12 gauge shotgun tearing a nigga lid off
Kidnap a girlfriend dropping a nigga kid off
Connect with the bricks they droppin a nigga shit off
Drop top then get it popping when it skid off

It's chess baby, the pawn and the rook is out

They was shaking then the Feds came and shook 'em out
I remain raw, I know exactly what you came for
The wordplay that make ya brain sore
Massacred, no chainsaw
Your main chick is the gang whore (hahaha)
Different telly, same tour
If nobody don't die then it ain't war
If a fiend don't die, then it ain't pure
If you don't at least try then you ain't sure
But just know that when you rise, they gon' hate more
And make sure that when you die that you ain't poor
You get back what you give, don't expect more
Pills, weed, coke, dope, that's a connect 4
Right next store, another hunnid coming in on the next shore
Sure, strategize the block killers
Ratters filled to the top with the cop killers
Distributors of the heroin, the top billers
You gotta be paralyzed to not feel us
Small fries in the eyes of Godzilla
By now you should realize the God's Iller

You feel the same? Get your coat get your friends
The truck right outside
Listen ma I wanna ball out
So when I nut I expect you to suck it all out
And let my man tear your walls out
Cause he just came home and he need pussy to fall out
I get it crump ask the fellow players
Kiss hit more hoes than they list in the yellow pages
It's never to cuff 'em share 'em right after I fuck 'em
To come clean I'm a mellow gangster
Pass a chick like a baton runner to runner
Been through a million thongs from summer to summer

I just wanna hit you from the back and watch the Apollo
And if the pussys all that I might holla tomorrow
But you acting like a rabbit how you cling to the carrots
It ain't the bling it's the nigga ma get it and stash it

 I wish I didn't have to be here
 It's not that bad..
Could always be worse, ya na'msayin?
All you gotta do, is stay in school
Anything you wanna do you could do ya na'msayin baby?
No matter what though, gotta keep your head up to the sky

This goes out to, all the infants
In this cold world that was born addicted
And to all the section 8 kids
Just remember these four words y'all - we gon' make it
The government keep on tryin to fool us
The system, keep on tryin to lose us
And all we can do is keep buyin computers
And log on now 'fore it start goin down
We gotta hold our head, keep our pride
Though it hurts when I see people sleep outside
Little babies with no socks on, eatin popcorn
We all know what they moms and they pops on
Out go the love when the drugs come
They never got nuttin for Christmas, and they ain't Muslim
This is a jewel, a lot of us was them
This is a jewel, a lot of us was them

Your head to the sky.. my my, my
You can win - you can win - if you keep your head
As long as you keep - your head - your head to the sky
My my, my..

Uhh, to my lockdown niggas keep your head in the sky
To my shot down niggas keep your head in the sky
I don't know if it's better to ride, or better to die
And that's why there's red in my eye
Cause people don't know what the ghetto is like
Either you make it out, or the terrible life
I don't wanna be a broke bastard
And everybody in the hood got somebody in they fam' with a coke habit
You work for minimum wage
I'mma get in the game, get shot or a bid in the cage
It's a risk I gotta take - and I'mma be the nigga
With the bricks and the stash and the biscuit outta state
And even though I'm blessed with the gift
I gotta move cause the pain and the sickness gotta wait
I go extremely hard - why let up?
And I can breathe long as I keep my head up
 w/ minor variations

Uhh, uhh - uh-huh, uhh - uh..
Aiyyo I come from a place where it's three strikes out
And your life's on the line, so we iced out
Summertime gettin money, three dice out
Tanktops, and jean shorts, we Niked out
Headbands, and four wheelers
Jeeps and Coupes and convos, about who know more killers
It's all wrong but it's all right
It's a small world; matter fact it's a small life
We all trip but the way to survive
Is hold your head and make sure you fall right
And it's a quite fact, that whatever goes around comes right back
It's just like that
And we tryin to touch major paper
Everybody in the struggle it gets greater later
Never say can't, it's better to try
And you can breathe long as you keep your head in the sky

Don't you let nobody stop you, mm

I scream D block, cause I know my niggas the realest

You know niggas that murder I got a couple of killers
My brother's kissing the Dom, niggas'll lick at your mom
And if I ever go to jail, they'll get up the bond

Said what the fuck is this feeling,i had to count it again
We can skip in the Porsche and go bounce in the end
I get high in the crib that the fountains is in

Hustler of the year now my name is just because


First I counted a dollar, then I counted a million
My new connect is from Haiti, my old connect was Brazilian
I got two occupations and thats rappin and dealing
Got the team full of shooters, but personally I be chillin
Still got base heads that owe me, I let em go by the O.Z
Yellow gold or the rozzie the big face on the Rollie
D.I.E. from my fellows the J O or margielas
Co signed by Biggie so what the fuck can you tell us
First my palm started itchin and then I started twitchin
When that money is coming niggas start feeling different
They ain't hear you at first, now they starting to listen
Cause when you're standing out, a handouts a tradition
Ya heard me",https://genius.com/Jadakiss-count-it-lyrics

Jadakiss, motherfucker, from the, the, the block
Top five dead or alive, it's still the same
Said the real niggas is back to kill the lames
But somethin' ain't right, it don't feel the same
At this point in life, I'm too real to change
Dipped in my stash, splurged on the dweller
S550 coupe light yellow
Outside, I'm good for three; Mike Miller
If I get a DM from your girl, I might drill her
Hand-to-hand, I sold more grams than 
Thriller
All I fuck with is ballplayers and killers
Niggas is just gettin' ill, I been iller
Bank account similar to Ben Stiller's
I dick down chicks, all emerged in my veins
After I get 'em, send 'em with birds on a plane
I'm tryin' to be beefin' with all these nerds in the game
Purple haze and heroin merged with the 'caine
Messin' with Jada, another rapper found slain
Usually they actors that try to act around dames
I've realized that you cats are wowin'
I can't stop them, my stacks are Yao Ming
'fore you even know it, murder, BANG {*gunshot*}
I ain't seen shit and I ain't heard a thing
You heard the name

Ayo,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Uh collision, I'm a problem
And nobody can solve em, I'm long division
On the road of success but it's more of a mission
They said I would be dead or I was goin to prison
No one of them is certain but the other one isn't
Made rare decisions, rock diamonds that impared your vision
Even supplied ya'll for years with listen
Like I'm just starting but I got years of wisdom
Stripes I got nigga, it took years to get em
Whenever you see him notice his same peers is with him
He destroys tracks the minute he hears the rhythm
Not only a hell of a flow but his ears forbidden
And if you think this is a ring tone, yea you kiddin
Fifty thousand records sold, right yea you kiddin
It was his time to go he ain't care who did em
Didn't appreciate life and got aired for lying
PCP by the liter, good sheba
Sergios tech sweat suits, good Addidas
The jewels is invincible that we was suppose to get from them
Use to send them to the store, now we blowin piff with them
Nowa days it's different, I was fortunate
Cause I did alot of listening, the new era is missin it
Everybody three fifty seven and four fif'n it
Drug program two to four, three to six'n it
Feds send niggas way out by lake Michigan
Put the coke in the tires only if they Michelin
Never talk on the fone only deal with official men
You don't even know homie that put you in the shit you in
Gotta busy schedule and I don't think I can fit you in
What's good for me ain't good for them
No matter what set you claim or what hood you in
I hit you and I find you a wood box for them to put you in
Stay away from the people that act scary
The Maserati Gran Turismo is black cherry
People that control the world from black berries
But you will never know cus they keepin the facts buried
Before I had a deal I was movin them packs freely
Made a couple million of of rap & then I got greedy
Competition got so garbage it got easy
Then the internet kilt the game and it got greezy
Download upload before the dutch rolled
Not only that all the rappers got went into suck mode
Soon as the plague is done with, you know son spit
Let you get ya mind right, bypass the dumb shit
Before I hop in the league, you gotta pop it and leave
This is somethin you can pop in and leave
And I Know it's theraputic but be careful how you use it
Cause the flow might make your ear drums pop and then bleed",https://genius.com/Jadakiss-ayo-lyrics

So when you see me, think about a funeral home
A lot of niggas get fed to the crabs
And yeah I'm a boss, four hoes give me head in the bath
Pound of weed is like a medicine bag
I look at my son different
Gun spitting head in your back, stand over the body
And fire again, send Sigel a wire, I'm riding again
We getting it on, throw your man' leg on a loan
He can't walk, put your brother' tongue in a mail
He can't talk, kissing the ring or kissing the dirt?
I'm in the back of the limo, lifting her skirt, ripping your earth
Blowing weed in the Corona deluxe
Phony niggas wanna roll in a truck
But they don't know what's up

I'm shoot over to Cali, na'msayin? Check this movie out
Then I'mma check honey out
Then I'mma fly back to N.Y., see what's goin on in the projects
Then I'mma shoot down to Atlanta
See how it's goin down in the Dirty Dirty
Then I'mma shoot over to New Orleans, Detroit, Chicago, Seattle, Miami..

I'm on my way to Cali to see my bitch (say what?)
I'm on my way to New York to see my bitch (that's right)
Down in Atlanta done seen my bitch - now
I don't know, what you've been told
But I'm on my way to Philly to see my bitch (say what?)
I'm on my way to Texas to see my bitch (that's right)
Down in Miami done seen my bitch - now
I don't know, what you've been told

But I'm on my way to Cali to see my bitch
And do a movie but first I gotta read my script
After that I get it poppin at the La Mentage
I'm gettin skull in the Ferrari, bottom garage
Then it's back to N.Y. to my project bitch
She like to do it anywhere, a real hardhead bitch
And she enjoy riffin when I'm gone
But love when I say I'll be there in a minute, listen for the horn
{*beep beep beep*} I'm down in Atlanta to see my bitch
She go to college, she model, and she got chips
Rock La Perla lingerie
Tattoo on her ass that say that this belong's to Ja'
Now I don't know, what you've been told
But 'Kiss be blowin they mind and spendin they dough
And I'm goin on a lil' trip, I'll be back
Anybody lookin for me, just tell 'em that I'm


I'm on my way to New Orleans, for one whole month
To see my shorty in Magnolia, she got gold fronts
We don't kiss; matter fact I only hit that once
But she chill and she like to smoke big fat blunts
Then I'm swingin through Detroit to see my boo
You think you got every color mink? She got two
And she just slapped a hundred on the toy
Honey was a gangstress for real, gettin money off the board
Then I'm hittin Chi-Town, soon as it die down
Lay up in my chick's house, break a couple pies down
Nobody can do this but 'Kiss, freeze..
.. music please {*ahhh-hahhh!*}
Ahh, where was I? Oh yes
Off to the Valley so I gotta go West
My chick got the gold Benz and the gray Lex
I hit her with a shirt on cause she got fake breasts, c'mon


That I'm on my way to Philly to see my bitch (yesss)
She talkin shit on the celly like she that bitch (yesss)
And this how you know it's definitely real
When you drop the CL-6, then you knock Stephanie Mills
When I get there, she gon' show me more than some brotherly love
Top piece 'til I cum in her mug
I'm tryin to leave and she givin me hell
Told her bend over; I'mma crack that ass like the Liberty Bell
{*BONG!*} Now I'm on my way to Texas to see my bitch
I oughta be there by breakfast if I leave by six
And ain't nuttin stoppin Ja'
I'mma get the puss, catch the Rockets game, then be on my way
Now I'm down in Miami to see my bitch
She got her own beauty salon, and she strip
I'm proud of the girl, backside's out of this world

Come on, two-step, uh, yeah
Now let's work, ha-ha, HA-HAAAEEH!

Yeah, we can do it up, just the two of us
Me and you shorty, we don't need the crew with us
You know my hammer large, I'm the man in charge
I like your Louie bag, the Monty camouflage
A little Zinfandel, a little Ace of Spade
I'ma roll the purple up, let you taste the haze
You know I gotta thug it, Olympic size swimming pool
With the mosaic towels at the bottom of it
You could spend and keep spending, I ain't got a budget
I can put enough away and I ain't gotta touch it
Don't worry about nothing, Kiss got it covered
You're now rocking with the best girl, gotta love it

Girl (two stepping with my gangsta self)
Oh girl (two stepping with my gangsta self
You're now rocking with the best, you don't need no help)
You're now rocking with the best of both
Girl (two stepping with my gangsta self)
Oh girl (two stepping with my gangsta self
You're now rocking with the best, you don't need no help)
You're now rocking with the best of both, girl

When you're at the top, there's no stopping it
Take a second realize who you're rocking with
Just noticed the color car that you're shopping with
Take pride in the joint when you're mopping it
Kiss melts in your mouth like chocolate
Make sure it's hot whenever you're dropping it
Right now we got billionaire guap to get
You ain't in the boys club, you just copped the fit
I'm two-stepping in, honey popping in
Your first was the worst now it's the opposite
Yes, I must confess girl
You're now rocking with the best, girl, uhh

Girl (two stepping with my gangsta self)
Oh girl (two stepping with my gangsta self
You're now rocking with the best, you don't need no help)
You're now rocking with the best of both
Girl (two stepping with my gangsta self)
Oh girl (two stepping with my gangsta self
You're now rocking with the best, you don't need no help)
You're now rocking with the best of both, girl

Get your glass up, 'cause I'm back again
What it do shorty? What's happening?
You know this beat jamming, it's remarkable
Everybody looking, what you gon' do?
(Now move closer for the) kid (one time)
(Closer for the) kid (one time)
(Closer for the) kid (one time)
Back that ass on the kid (one time)
(Now drop it like you do it for the) East (one time)
(Drop it like you do it for the) West (two times)
(Drop it like you do it for the) North (three times)
(Drop it like you do it for the) South (girl)

We could stay around here, we could take a trip
I take you to the block show you how I make it flip
And I spend it so fast 'cause I make it quick
All I ever knew how to do is make it sick
Pop another bottle ma, let's take a sip
Close your eyes, blow the candles out, make a wish
And just forget about the rest of 'em
'Cause you're rocking with the best of 'em

Girl (two stepping with my gangsta self)
Oh girl (two stepping with my gangsta self
You're now rocking with the best, you don't need no help)

Yes sir !
I don?t care who you are
I don?t care what you do
There comes a time (uh huh)
Everybody?s life (yup!)
When?
You just gotta tell a motha fucka
Chorus:
Yo, If you blatantly hatin' and waitin on my downfall
Then just be patient, and kiss my ass!
If you didn't believe and you had a problem
With my previous l.p's, then kiss my ass!
If you downright spoiled and feel I don't do enough for you
That's right, kiss my ass !
Pop off when you see me, keep it movin or breathe easy
Whateva, kiss my ass!
Verse 1:
Yo everybody love him
Every body know him
He gettin money now
Everybody think he owe em?
They stay askin him for weed plants like he grow em'
They know if he catch em? violatin he'll blow em?
Always wanna know what he doin where he goin
What chain was he wearin, what he drivin ,was he glowin?
Who givin him head, who he hittin, who he go wit
Who u seen him in the mall, or creepin out the mo? wit?
Roc-a-fella, def jam, the right label to go wit
And when the album drops, are they really gon promote it?
Is L.A behind the project and are you focused?
I just smile and ask them back, why you wanna know this?
Everybody got they hands out, here we go again
You ain't buy none of his albums, you downloaded them
He ain't got no security, the pound?s holdin him
And if he never told you before, you now know it then
Chorus:
If you blatantly hatin' and waitin on my downfall
Then just be patient, and kiss my ass!
If you didn't believe and you had a problem
With my previous l.p's, then kiss my ass!

Pop off when you see me, keep it movin or breathe easy
Whateva, kiss my ass!
Verse 2:
I don?t care about your hair or your nails
I ain't got no bails and no lawyers for niggas that caught sales
I don?t care about your rent or your mortgage or the cocaine shortage
Or how many times you been distorted
And I ain't got a dime for the limo, for your prom, betta get it from your mom
Or get up on ya grind
I don?t wanna hear the garbage about how u need your car fixed
Or money to get back and forth to the doctors
Don?t try to seduce me cuz I ain't got a quarter for a Lucy
Just give me a dap or salufe me I don?t wanna hear the sorrow I ain't got nothin to borrow
I?m goin on tour so I won't see you tomorrow
I don?t care about the drought, or how much the price change
What u almost did with the bank, at the dice game
And I?m sorry if I forgot, to tell you how I felt but I really mean it a lot
Chorus:
If you blatantly hatin' and waitin on my downfall
Then just be patient, and kiss my ass!
If you didn't believe and you had a problem
With my previous l.p's, then kiss my ass!
If you downright spoiled and feel I don't do enough for you
That's right, kiss my ass !
Pop off when you see me, keep it movin or breathe easy
Whateva, kiss my ass!
Verse 3:
Yo you outside standin around, front of the club
Coulda been went inside, it only cost you a dub
What u tryna wait on me to get in free
Only thing is we ain't spoke since 2003
So I act like I don?t know you when I see you in the town tomorrow I gotta blow you
This is what I go through
Now I got a lawsuit and u got a velour suit
Some bullshit jewelry from canal and a 04 coupe
The car coulda been better, for that to be the case
The scar woulda been better
Screw a vendetta, you show it you betta pull it
But since u tryna count my money then count bullets
Soon as u allow it instantly you become a liability to cowards
Cheaper to send them flowers
By now you should know it, this is how I feel and how I?ve always felt
Even though I don?t show it
Chorus:
If you blatantly hatin' and waitin on my downfall
Then just be patient, and kiss my ass!
If you didn't believe and you had a problem
With my previous l.p's, then kiss my ass!

Yo, we gon hit something
I'm cutting the rug wit love
Or I'm on the wall pressed up against something
You should let em know the boss is back
So y'all niggas that went wood go get more shalack
I see bowlegs backing it in
I put it on her wit the ol' school two step, clap and a spin
Filled up her cup, slid her a dutch
You know what's happenin then (what?) in
And all I did was having a grin
Off top let her know I ain't one of these dudes
Rhyming to lose, naw ma I'm rapping to win
Yeah! yes! They know the God be fresh
I'm on that ass blowing purple on the washing set
And even though I came wit thugs
You still might catch a few of them 'Stepping In The Name Of Love'
Uh! It's D on the Block, the Ryde is Ruff
And you wit the motherfucking Billionaire Boys Club!

Would you go to jail, LIGHT ME UP!

My wrists and my neck be gleamin
Whatever I got cost, Honey look hotter than Hot Sauce

Then she get dropped off, told her that the whole block pop off
She come through, take them rocks off
And therefore, wanna know, what would they stare for
They heard about the work, it's as white as your Air Force
Maybe it's the voice that the world got an ear for
Most of these rappers, I just don't care for
So I be on the honies wit the big ol' asses
Hypno and Cleako in big ol' glasses
We could do the damn thang, order the champagne
Honey's Head of the State, and I'm running the Campaign
If you coming, c'mon, if not I'm gone
Other than that, yo Pharrell, sing my song!


Hey yo, Honey got a goon thinking
That ass like that, she could have the room stinking
I - picked her up in the maroon Lincoln
Blew her back out until the moon sank in
Spend the profit, hold on the to the re
Lock me up, hold on the to key
I want you to wake up in the morning wit me
I got it bad for ya, breakfast and a cab for ya",https://genius.com/Jadakiss-hot-sauce-to-go-lyrics
Dinero,The Compound Gold Project,2016.0,"[Intro: Jadakiss + 
Beanie Sigel
]
Welcome back Beans, this history baby
Broadstreet bully set free
Compound, compound
Top 5 dead or alive, raspy
And it's a shame what they'll do for that legal tender

Money is the root of all evil is what they teach you
That's what made Nino rock his brother's keeper
That's what made Alpo slaughter Rich Porter
When you got a big supporter and your mafia tight
Money, power, respect, comin' at order
Dollars ain't shit without the knowledge
Mike got robbed, I robbed him
Hammer got hammered, too much stylin'
Too many cars in the garages
Too much flauntin', 100 man entouragin'
If money make your world go around, you got a problem
But let's make no mistake, let's get it straight
I've done seen paper take mothers off section 8
They say the early bird get the worm
So I left home to earn
And left no stone unturned
As a young buck I hit the bricks, took the street route
Y'all dudes are still in the nest with your beak out
Whoever learned you dudes is incorrect
Cause I don't trust no chick, mom no disrespect
And you done wiped my ass and I done fed off your breasts
If you dealin' them cards boo I'm cuttin' the deck

So you think money is the root of all evil? Have you ever asked what is the root of money? 
Those pieces of paper which should have been gold should are a token of honor
(Jadakiss: That's why they love you when you don't got it
Then soon as you get it they hate you)

Haha!
All four pockets, bankrolls that can't be tucked
It's strange I done seen money break families up
For 500 cash even seen your man get cut
Postin' pictures on the 'Gram all bandaged up
If you do get it, don't take it for granted bruh
The counters are all marble and granite bruh
If it's done right you can get a flower from a seed
And the root of money is power for more greed
Sad part about it, it's somethin' we all need
I know ex-kingpins that's working at Wal-Greens
Know a team of young swipers, shake up the mall scene
Anything to get the money, they need it like morphine
They give you lump sums then they tax you for it
People ask you for it or they'll clap you for it
Soon as you build it, they destroy it
Then when you need it you can't get it
You get it? You can't enjoy it

Money is a tool of exchange which can't exist unless there are goods produced and men able to produce them. Money is not the tool of the moochers, who claim your product by tears. Or of the looters who take it from you by force. (Money)",https://genius.com/Jadakiss-dinero-lyrics
I Tried,The Last Kiss,2009.0,"Every day, something in my way, I try
Shit ain't going right, I try to see the light, I try
Ohh, it's like my eyes got a cover on 'em
And something holding me back
A better man, better level, better know I try

Uh-huh, get off me
HA-HAAAEEH! Uh, yeah yo
Listen, I done played with the snakes in the grass
Paid for my mistakes I made in the past
Everybody ate when I came with the cash
At least I tried to ride the wave 'til it crashed
Same wood on the gun handle is on the dash
All the hoods that son ran through is on smash
They can't identify you with a mask
And the Bible'll tell you nothing is gonna last
The name of the game's survival
If you make it alive when you ride through they make it arrival
My boo is gon' ride, you know I'm gon' ride too
Make an M every day, I'm gon' try to - let's go

Every day, something in my way, I try
Shit ain't going right, I try to see the light, I try
Ohh, it's like my eyes got a cover on 'em
And something holding me back
A better man, better level, better know I try

Uh-huh, get off me
HA-HAAAEEH! Uh, yeah yo
I tried to tell niggas I'm willing to blast for it
I only try to give it to niggas that ask for it
Got them things on the scale, I'm still weighing 'em
Thought my dues was paid, I'm still paying 'em
Couple Eleanor's and the Goose, I'm still Bay'ing 'em
Semi's and the fully's, know that the truth stay with him
Wolves and gorillas is loose, so don't play with him
Something's holding him back, nothing that you could say to him
Popped champagne with Biggie at the Palladium
Put that good hawk work in with the titaniums
Shit switch around when them heats get fired
And ya peeps just died, but at least he tried - let's go

Every day, something in my way, I try
Shit ain't going right, I try to see the light, I try
Ohh, it's like my eyes got a cover on 'em
And something holding me back
A better man, better level, better know I try

Uh-huh, get off me, HA-HAAAEEH!
Uh, yeah - watch the game get tooken over
I'm still on the same side of the fence, I'm just looking over
A solider, from the gravel to the grass
To the obstacles in life I traveled in the past
Whether I'm holding a mic or holding a MAC
It's like an invisible force is holdin me back
But I ain't letting go of my pride
After I get the dough I'll slide, better know I tried
Let's go, uh

Every day, something in my way, I try
Shit ain't going right, I try to see the light, I try
Ohh, it's like my eyes got a cover on 'em
And something holding me back
A better man, better level, better know I try

Here come another day up on me
Put the pressure on me, here we go again ahhh
I try to do what's right when life is so wrooooong
I want a better way, I see a better day
'Nuff what the people said, I want a better me
God knows that I try but time won't wait for me

Every day, something in my way, I try
Shit ain't going right, I try to see the light, I try
Ohh, it's like my eyes got a cover on 'em
And something holding me back
A better man, better level, better know I try

I tried, hey!",https://genius.com/Jadakiss-i-tried-lyrics
Gone Too Long,I Love You (A Dedication To My Fans),2011.0,"It's been too long and I can't do this baby (nah)
Said you're coming home but you've been gone too long (I'm sorry)
Its been too much (I know, I know) of the same thing baby (you right)
I can't take no more, you been gone too long
It started off asking you to pray for me
Now I'm on the phone begging you to wait for me
I've completed a lot of programs
So when I see the Board now they should have a day for me
Hear it in your voice that you're getting tired
When I ask do you Love me you getting quiet
One day at a time I'm just getting by it
When the meter runs out time get expired

This jail shit is corny, really startin' to bore me
And you gettin' fed up, on top of that you horny
Knew that it would happen, cause u couldn't assure me
Dealt with a nigga that did time way before me
You ain't look happy to see me when you saw me
You don't even write me back you just ignore me
You don't even answer the jack you just record me
Guess I been gone too long you can't support me

In the penitentiary my name ring
When I come home it's the same thing
Guess you gotta take what the game brings
Niggas change but a lot will remain wayne
Thinking about it while I sit here
Besides life ain't shit fair, I ain't heard from her this year
Guess I'll try to make it better when I get there

See I been holding you down for a minute
And its been like forever since we did it
And the nights have been hell without You baby
And everyday I feel like I'm going crazy
Cause you told That this would be the last time
But u said the same thing last time
And I promised myself that I'm through crying
So I guess I'ma have to kiss you goodbye",https://genius.com/Jadakiss-gone-too-long-lyrics

And she said she do X, I gave her one and a half
Let her get her roll on and made her jump in the bath
I left her standin there sayin.. haha
""I wanna.."" come through in the orange M5
And I got them things in the trunk and they goin for ten-five
It could and it will get ugly, but so what?
No matter how it go down, the hood'll still love me
Never cut broads, I let everybody hit 'em
My bullets is like chicken pox, everybody get 'em

She got in her mind that, she gon' get some Fendi if I bone her
(eh-eh) Backshot was murder from the rear
And she gave me mean top, while I blew the purple in her hair
Oh yeah, after I nutted I was a goner
And still got honey thinkin that
""I wanna.."" automatic start on the Aston Martin
Can't beat 'Kiss cause you ain't got half the heart an'
Get you hit on the inside for half a carton
Couple of suits - dawg, we fuckin with loot
I got enough dough to chill in court
But I know dudes with twenty-five in and they still ain't short
But never mind that, we can't lose

Al Qaeda off the top, I can give them the scope
But if I don't, just another nigga living with hope
You know, bigger the shipment, bigger the boat
Old head told me, groceries was bigger than dope
I run this shit, no, maybe not with the sales
Definitely in the streets, up top of the jails
And I do a lot of thinking, listening, observing
I know how to play my position, that's my word
I mwoah, by far, flow five star
Blow my weed and buy cars
Yeah, hard to live it fierce yo
Can't say competition is none, it's definitely scarce though
Know they say quiet money, boost yo' stash
Handling things, gotta let the roosters pass
Might have seen me in the M if the roof was glass

Fly gangsta nigga, stay blowing the vanilla
Life is a bitch, and if I ever meet her, I'mma tell her
Give it to anybody, on beat, acappella
Keeping yourself above water without sinking
Looking a man in his eye without blinking
If I ain't on Ocean or Collins, I'm on Lincoln
I run this shit, what the fuck is you all thinking
Bars is way too strong for you all weakling
Stay in the booth and stay out of the precinct
Cause my new hawk need blood on it
My back is killing me, I got New York on it
Only right that I give it to them, New York want it
Know the game will change in a New York moment
Even if my performance is local
I'm still considered the Michael Corleone of the vocals
I run this shit

New York City
Don't get it confused
Still the home of the Spitters
Jada, talk to them

K-I Double Shah
These niggas is nice, but I guess I'm double hot
Besides money, all the respect and the love I got
At this point in my life, who would expect me to hug the block
Guess it's just something in me that I love a lot
If not, probably have my hand in another pot
Get the Porsche from there and the Lambo from another lot
See if I can take my career to another notch
But in the meantime, you all know I run this shit

Put Ya Hands Up,Kiss Tha Game Goodbye,2001.0,"Turn the fuckin beat on!
Ha!! Yeah, we back! ?
I had to switch back to Dom Perignon in rap baby!
Cock-and-run to stay in the business
Son of a bitch! Double R, look at me now motherf
Two-thousand-and-one, ""Kiss the Game Goodbye"" let's get it on!

It's the J-A-D-A I got beef with the feds and the D-A
I got footage in the game press replay
I got bitches in the club all over me ma take it e-asy
And y'all scared I can tell
And I'ma get Buckss like Milwaukee cause like Sam I Can-sell
I'm that nigga y'all know that
Bang you in the yard then slide off on the early go back
In the streets I flash the cannon like Kodak
And I spray threes so say cheese
Already told you I'm looking for enemies
Double R so of course it's better
I love cornrows and Farrah Fawcett feathers
It's a message in a glass bottle read the letter
Money in the bank membership Visa sweaters
And we ride or d-i-e together

Uh uh come on put ya hands up
Nah, fuck that put ya hands down
Come on put ya hands up
Nah, fuck that put ya hands down

Y'all know I got the master flow, fast or slow
Y'all wanna know who the best is aks ya hoe
The honies don't lie they love it
And they cop for real trust me dogg the thugs will dub it
'Kiss hit you with consecutive hot shit
Therefore nobody never gon' spit like I spit
Get money just to walk through off the books
So when you mention my name shit is off the hook
Shirts is off, titties is out
And you know I'm there the hardest niggas in the city is out
I'm in the club ice over the thermal waitin for you to try me
When the lights get low I'ma burn you
Start with straight shots and then pop bottles
Flirt with the hood rats then pop models
Gotta slay two or more, ma that's our motto
And y'all might get down with the team if y'all swallow

Uh uh come on put ya hands up
Nah, fuck that put ya hands down
Come on put ya hands up
Nah, fuck that put ya hands down
Kiss the game goodbye, the game is mine
You thought wrong change ya mind
I'm the nigga that'll pop the king and scoop the queen
And take over the town with a ruthless team
New S-Type wagon, future green
Gun heavy pants sagging I'm used to cream
Who you know can make a million dollar bail on cash
Never did a day and got the jails on smash, K-I double
I move the perico quick, and just let manteca bubble
'Kiss been a boss, y'all just start working
Now put ya hands up 'til ya arms start hurting
Don't put 'em down 'til I tell you
Whoever wanna be hard headed then find out what the shells do
Now you can put 'em down if you want
But soon as the hook come back put 'em up
Uh uh come on put ya hands up
Nah, fuck that put ya hands down
Come on put ya hands up
Nah, fuck that put ya hands down


(Jadakiss) Whattup little man? What's the matter?
(lil' man) I wish I didn't have to be here
(Jadakiss) It's not that bad..
Could always be worse, yaknahmsayin?
All you gotta do, is stay in school
Anything you wanna do you could do yaknahmsayin baby?
No matter what though, gotta keep your head up to the sky
(Jadakiss)
This goes out to, all the infants
In this cold world that was born addicted
And to all the section eight kids
Just remember these four words y'all - we gon' make it
The government keep on tryin to fool us
The system, keep on tryin to lose us
And all we can do is keep buyin computers
And (?) all now 'fore it start goin down
We gotta hold our head, keep our pride
Though it hurts when I see people sleep outside
Little babies with no socks on, eatin popcorn
We all know what they moms and they pops on
Out go the love when the drugs come
They never got nuttin for Christmas, and they ain't Muslim
This is a jewel, a lot of us was them
This is a jewel, a lot of us was them
(Chorus: Ann Nesby)
Your head to the sky.. my my, my
You can win - you can win - if you keep your head
As long as you keep - your head - your head to the sky
My my, my..
(Jadakiss)
Uhh, to my lockdown niggas keep your head in the sky
To my shot down niggas keep your head in the sky
I don't know if it's better to ride, or better to die
And that's why there's red in my eye
Cause people don't know what the ghetto is like
Either you make it out, or the terrible life
I don't wanna be a broke bastard
And everybody in the hood got somebody in they fam' with a coke habit
You work for minimum wage
I'ma get in the game, get shot or a bid in the cage
It's a risk I gotta take - and I'ma be the nigga
With the bricks and the stash and the biscuit outta state
And even though I'm blessed with the gift
I gotta move cause the pain and the sickness gotta wait
I go extremely hard - why let up?
And I can breathe long as I keep my head up
(Chorus) w/ minor variations
(Jadakiss)
Uhh, uhh - uh-huh, uhh - uh..
Aiyyo I come from a place where it's three strikes out
And your life's on the line, so we iced out
Summertime gettin money, three dice out
Tanktops, and jean shorts, we Niked out
Headbands, and four wheelers
Jeeps and Coupes and convos, about who know more killers
It's all wrong but it's all right
It's a small world; matter fact it's a small life
We all trip but the way to survive
Is hold your head and make sure you fall right
And it's a quite fact, that whatever goes around comes right back
It's just like that
And we tryin to touch major paper
Everybody in the struggle it gets greater later
Never say can't, it's better to try
And you can breathe long as you keep your head in the sky
(Ann Nesby)
Don't you let nobody stop you, mm
Heyy, heyyy, yeahhh!

The young boss of the cross for four quarters
And from three point land, he's all water
Matter fact, call him the king
The way he breaks down the defense
Its like he got the ball on a string
And he will blow by you fast
Penetrate and dish it off

Ya hesitation to stop and pop will be somethin' else

So I keep it genuine, fresh, and always introspective
This pen and pencil should be a Ginsu, my shit will get through
 you bitches foul and we official
Nigga, find a new position
You niggas on the couch without no fucking Jeremy Lin moves
Fast bitches in a slow limo
Rather that 62, but the shits so big, I do forget doe
I could use this tempo
Got a model joint, high heel, she 6'4""
But it don't mean shit though
When a nigga call I bet she gon get low
Ha, DC up to YO
The writer of the ribbon in the sky could see that I'm dope

Right when everybody else turned down we turn up
Bottles poppin' and we smokin' the loud we turn up
Lookin out and see you wondering how we turn up
By the time they get me poppin and now we turn up, turn up

Ice T's, one layer players over dungarees
Fresh cut, iced out, true blue number 3s
Everybody smokin' good, we just got a hundred piece
Tryna stay sucka free, still runnin' from the Ds
Ballin' just a hobby homie, we ain't tryna get you mad
Baddest bitches in the world in the lobby catching cabs
Nothin' on the arm, everything paid for in cash
Perforated leather on the seat, suede on the dash
Lotta niggas like to spend, yeah, well I love to stash
Muthafuckin' chopper in the trunk, gloves and the mask
Most niggas get guilt, couple niggas get a pass
A few niggas hit their number right before they hit the gas

Right when everybody else turned down we turn up

Lookin out and see you wondering how we turn up
By the time they get me poppin and now we turn up, turn up

They watching me like paparazzi
They wanna know if I'm really in Versace
I'm with this bitch, I'm watching hockey
They got my swag on copy
They wanna know my every move
What kind of girls I like, what kind of girls I do
Can't nothin' prepare you for fame, it's not a game
You gotta be mentally sane inside your brain
Any drug that I ever did, I never became
I never let it get the best of me, the stronger I became
Hard as I work you can never take from my name
I'd been in the mud and felt the fire come from the flame
These rappers asking around out of town, did I slang
I can't respond to these comments, I can't convict my game
I talked to Jada one day and knew I had made a change
I used to listen to LOX screaming I bought a Glock
I pledge allegiance to Biggie I'll never talk to cops
I'll make this rapping an easy 3 bands until I drop

Even though the love's frail the thug's real
All you gotta do is just follow the blood trail
Much harder fightin when the battle is uphill
- Whatever the knife can't handle the slug will
Keep a good lawyer that's smart work on cases
Still gotta run from the NARCs, they gon' chase us (run)

You 'gon make them boys dump, it's like that for real, it's like that for real

Yeah shorty wild, tre pounds, forty cals
At the dice game with brand new hundreds forty thou'
Stay fly work out, all we eat is Halal
You'll never catch 'em dirty cause all they keep is a smile
When they caught 'em with a gat in the car you beat it in trial
He don't say too much, never eager to style
Remind me of Gotti, Shyne with the shotties
Lawyer so good paid a fine for a body
Heroin and B-more, crib by the seashore
Car service to the G4 Fila Velour
Piff rolled in the dutch or the Cuban cigar
Tryin to expand the brand so he could see more
Everybody love him from the Crips to the B-dogs
Leave niggas for dead, let 'em have a bleed off
Four-four to the head, will tear a nigga meat off
And he don't show no emotions when he lettin that heat off
 (50 Cent)
I don't wanna waste time talkin to fellas
Who run up on me talkin that bullshit
Instead I let them talk when my goons get hellish
The only way they talk is with a full clip
You 'gon make them boys dump, you 'gon make them boys slump

Niggas dyin, I ain't prayin, I don't even fuck with 'em
Card game shuffle; hundred grand in the duffle (woo!)
Blackjack, poker, pinochle - you win, fuck you
Niggas tryin to lie on me, they sayin I'm grimy (yeah)
Fo' hundred mil' and I still can't chill (fuck that!)
Call me G, double barrel, N - GOON!
Boom! I do it like a 'Natti nigga do (what's up?)

Shell-case muffle, make me come touch you
I finger-fuck my firearm, we intimate, I'm into it

Yo, yeah...
If you hit 'em in the head with the dummies, then you good
Funeral homes make the most money in the hood (Uh)
Either usin the chrome, pearl handles or the wood
Animals tryin to get away with whatever they could
It's spooky, how you could get rich off ?loosies?
Four stacks for the jacket, sneaks cost a deuce-y
You see the five stars, I'm a general, salute me
They want a nigga to disappear, they tryna poof me
I'm just in the crib countin gwap, up all night
I got a new crew, DOS - Dump On Sight
I be in and out of the country I jump off flights
Four-fifth is room temperature, the pumps on ice (Ice)
Handle shit accordingly, whenever it comes to you
Do the right thing or the get the right thing done to you
Whatever you do, I just hope you got a gun with you
The +Tommy+ is like a live band when the +drum+ hits you
DUMP!

Happy to be Here,UnKnown,UnKnown,"This for the babies, the bums, the crackheads, the ex-convicts
C'mon
Its another one, I'm just happy to be here
I ain't Hollywood, but the hood put me first
So I don't worry about nothin cuz it could be worse
Good things come to those that wait
Hot things come to those that hate, I know you can relate
I keep nothing less than a hundred grand upstairs
My conversations is deep with the man upstairs
I'll be rappin to y'all, he be rappin to me
So at the end of the day I'm just happy to be
Look, I dont need a Grammy, only thing I need
To make history is a budget and the Dean family
Firearm close to the jock
My life's just like a verse, I dont punch though, I go from the top
Shit just happen I ain't plan it
I'm thankful though and won't take shit for granted
So all that greasy talkin y'all can can it
Bottom line 'Kiss is the champ, understand it

I'm just happy to be here (I'm just happy to be here yo..I'm just happy to be here ya know?)
I'm just happy to be here (I'm just happy to be here yo..I'm just happy to be here ya know?)
Yo I'm just happy to be here
When I went to get some sneakers they gave me a free pair
And I got a hoodie n jeans (so what?)
So I gotta slide through Brooklyn then boogie through Queens
Then I head to Harlem and the Bronx
Then I'm on a first-class flight to Miami tomorrow
Hit the club then the strip club
They pop off pop E, I smoke weed and get my motherfuckin dick sucked
Then I hit both of the liners
Show ID cuz Kiss ain't hittin a minor (nuh uh)
Now I'm in the A-T-L
Get loose, get crunk, get drunk at the one-one-deuce
And niggas know J gotta go to LA cuz ain't nothin like some Cali weed
Then I'mma rent a Lamborghini, take a trip to the bay and hit Webber on the cell cuz they playin today

C'mon, lets get it on, lets do it
I'mma show you how the K-I-double S do it
I learned to enhance the pain, so I can't complain
Now that I understand the game
And I got loot too, but so what?
I be in the hood often, y'all just shoot through
We do it all, pull them thangs out, fight
Freestyle off the head sit down and write
And the world ain't ready for this outfit of our
The burners, the jewelry, the houses, the cars
Anybody with ears can bounce with the bars
I'm the hottest rapper out come and bounce with the god
Time's up, kiss the game goodbye
Nines up when I came for mine
So makeway for the new don
23's on the Yukon
All that shit that you've seen on the cover of the DuPont

Get it off nigga, hustle like a muh'fukcer
Fuck the law nigga, hustle like a muh'fucker
Hustle, hustle, yeah hustle like a muh'fucker

Blue suits hate me
The narcs can't stand me
The DA hoping she catch a nigga with the swammy
Im just tryna make a few dollars to feed my family
The gears are slipping on the hoopti
I need the tranny
I'm out here, in a track suit
And some shell toes
The work ain't potent
But its strong enough to sell though
Can't even lie dawg I'd rather be on Melrose
But I got a quota to make before Chanel close
The connect hold me down, if I debt him then I'm a gonna
The work is half gone and the rent is around the corner
Ain't nothing like getting a nigga when you dont wanna
That just means that I'm a be in the trap untill the morning
Cause I hustle
 X 2

Started with an 8-ball
Ended up with kilos
For the bricks like the louisville players
Rip the team off
Carlo Gambino with a coke pot
Same G in common of the dope block
Thirty thirty off the roof, faggot make your throat pop
Or your head pop, Yall little niggas is funny like Redd Foxx
Or Eddie Murphy or Richard Pryor
See the team over there, the whole click fire
Until they sick and tired, of being sick and tired
I dont even talk when I deal, incase the brick is wired
Gun is like me in the booth, shit is spittin fire
Buck another sucka, hustle like a muh'fucka
 X 2

Uh jumped up off the porch, but ya'll was only seventeen
So inspired by them zoes, getting major cream
Fucking bitches, twenty-sixes came from triple beams
Dont recognize you in the hood, my youngest play the scene
True story, words to ma momma hommie
Them killers show up at your Christian ceremony
Cold hearted, chiefing like Bob Marley
Black ten ones, never did that Ed Hardy
I was out here, still a nigga out here
Hustlin like a muhfucka with my strap in there
I was paranoid, ducking 'em color boys
They catch me slipping, might just send me to Illnois
Shit done got real I just need a meal
When you broke, ain't nothing funny, dont know how it feel
Niggas snitchin like them bitches, must I keep it real
I never been no pussy Im a die trill",https://genius.com/Jadakiss-hustle-like-a-muh-lyrics

And the whip out of control taking a slip
Any jacker run up on me he taking a clip
If I hit the head he ain't finna get back up

Elegant wrist wear, Turbian movement

Forty cal kick back different when it's chrome
And now I react a little different cause I'm grown
Sour come out when the piff is all gone
Stay given them hell, keep heaven with me
I seen the game wear the rim out, that's a trip B
Comin down 7th in a new 750

Determined niggas make it
Kickin' down the door and we burnin' niggas naked
The house costs a million, sittin' on the beach
And the only thing I know if it's furnished I'ma take it
My bathtub lift up, my walls do a 360
We got the shit that the government got
Talkin' money then you rubbin' the spot
Real niggas say that they be wild
We on the Cayman island
On a yacht wit our favorite albums
A bad hoe and a plate of salmon
Smokin' and drinkin' nigga is you thinkin' that our fate is violent
I love my nigga for the fact that he real
And nobody on the faculty squeal, what
And if you facin' capital pun
Pass me a gun
And I'ma give you time to run

Ran through enough coke for Castro to build schools in Cuba
Teachin' kids how to read and write and use the Ruger

We got water, plus weight in the D

And be the same old niggas that ratted

Talkin' 'bout how we hawk niggas in they fuckin' back
Gun works official but niggas don't be wantin' that

'Coz they puss and they mans is lame
We so for real in the hood we make candy rain
I could easily send you to God
But come and see me at the Plaza Hotel I might give you a job

That the hood won't miss you you bitch ass nigga
Might find your man dead in the ocean
(He be aright though)
You know dead rappers get better promotion
Why we don't laugh at death, and cry at birth
Never say you can't do it til you try it first
Be the young niggas eager to pull it
But it's a message in everything trust me, even a bullet
Go to war with the eight and the pound
Think you got your ear to the street now
Put your face in the ground
'Coz my shells is expensive
You'll know exactly
Why when you yellin' in intensive
My fellas is offensive
Lucky 'coz I got guns that crack your back
But that's not what I prefer I manufacture crack
And, niggas turn bitch when you show 'em the steel
But we know how to bid so y'all go 'head and squeal
I'm comfortable far from home
Eatin' right, gettin' good rest either on the far or the foam
I'm the reason niggas got deals the past few years
Sound anything like Kiss then sign right here
And, y'all just talkin', I'm doin' it well

Pop in ya favorite movie, you can picture how I live
Soon as you die, know they got a scripture for you kid
But it ain't gon say nuttin bout the bitchin that you did
My type of fun will annoy them
Death by electricution or either poison
Life is a movie, its just how you play ya part
Alot of niggas got a mouth, but I got a heart

(I'm in the streets getting money)
(I'm in the streets getting money)
(I'm in the streets getting money)
I'm in these streets, hustlin' every day
(I'm in the streets getting money)
(I'm in the streets getting money)
(I'm in the streets getting money)
Yo, I'm on the block faithfully
Got it so good if I'm late they'll wait for me
Mama please pray for me
The devil does things in the worst ways
In the ER waiting to hear what the nurse say
I dun' payed for more funerals than birthdays
Finish a whole one and a half by Thursday (word)
So just imagine what I'm sittin' with
And I ain't splittin' it, I'm out here gettin' it

I'm in these streets, (I'm in the streets getting money)
I can't get away (I'm in the streets getting money)
(I'm in the streets getting money)
(I'm in the streets getting money)
I'm in these streets, (I'm in the streets getting money)
Hustlin' everyday (I'm in the streets getting money)
(I'm in the streets getting money)
(I'm in the streets getting money)
Organization is smooth and ran with a tight lip
Get rid of the work, hold the bread with a tight grip
Trust fund baby in the cut with a white chick
Was in a choke hold, now its in a vice grip
And even though my arm still strong with the dices
Drug dealer, I don't do jooks or heists
The fame is alright but the game is priceless
My heart beating but I'm still out here lifeless

Start off with a wish if you wanna grant shit
I was never a worker, I always ran shit (true)
They was doin' shelves, I did the stand smiths
My hair used to be nappier than Durant's shit
Where they got the work at, and how much the grams is
Build it up to a key that's what the plan is
You ain't got no fam just you and your manses
Out here taking penitentiary chances

I'm in these streets, hustlin' every day",https://genius.com/Jadakiss-in-the-streets-lyrics
Run,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Pss, yo, yo, yo (yo son roll!)
Oh shit, yo, yo, run!
Aiyo, I jumped from the 8th floor step, hit the ground
The pound fell, cops is coming
Runnin' through the pissy stairwells, I ain't hear nothin'
Buggin', only thing I remember was the bullshit summon
So I stopped at the 2nd floor, ran across, cracks is fallin'
My pockets is lean, clean when I vanished off
Took off, made track look easy
The walkie talkies them D-E-T's had, black, they was rated P.G
Run, I will not give up, no, quick flag the car down
Take me to, Ghost here they come now!
Er! Pull off quick, back up, hit the bitch, dog
Turned down Hill, light the Marley spliff
Run! I will not get bagged on the rock
Run! I seen what happened to Un, they bad with they cops
Run! They am' shit, plan shit, destroy evidence
Fuck a case, I'm not comin' home when I'm fifty six
Die with the heart of Scarface and take fifty licks
Before I let these crackers throw me and shit
Bounce if you a good kid, bounce, do the bird hop
Curse, swerve to get served, these cocksuckers got nerve
Heard I was killin' shit, they must got word
That I told the chief on Rich Port I don't wanna merge
I skated through the back of the building, hit the steps up
Ran up in Kay crib, lay daddy rest
I had to break free, police on me and they F-B's
Yelling ""I think his name Lex, that's his aunt, freeze""
That's when I hit the window, indo' coming out the back room
Boom, Pretty and his man, Black Caesar
Damn, they saw me and they bustin' at me
Cab just missed me, plus them goochie frames, foul, that's six fifty
Stop back at suite, them leaf defense slid through my man garden
Yelled out 'pardon', kept it moving, peace
Build be gone, ain't no honor amongst thieves
Please, plus they heard I'm getting Parmesan cheese
And I won't stop moving til the metal dig me
Say word, yo, make 'em work for it, young rookie, y'all need me
That's when it is, what it is, if it's that or the cup
But in the ill gangstas book what they niggas do is

Run! If you sell drugs in the school zone
Run! If you gettin' chased with no shoes on
Run! Fuck that! Run! Cops got, guns!
They givin' out life like by the tons
Run! If you ain't do shit, you it
That next felony, nigga, it's like three zip
So, run! Hop fences, jump over benches!
When you see me comin' get the fuck out the entrance!
Run! Fuck that! Run! Cops got guns!
Ah-hah! I might gotta take my shirt off (yeah, kid)
I like that one (uh-huh, go in, go in!)
Yo, uh, it's Task Force Tuesday, the NARCS is in the black car
I got five hundred, hundred packs in my backyard
Clear twelve-twelve's, that look like stuff shells
I'm cuttin' niggas throats on the sails, while they puff L's
Don't leave nothin' unbagged, shave everything
I learned from the O.G.'s to save everything (to save everything)
They come by one more time, they gon' hop out
They two deep, and one is a bitch, she gettin' knocked out
Then I can get rid of the pack
But I just copped this pretty chrome thing, so I'm dippin' with that
Uh, down-shiftin' on 'em like I got gears on me
(Run!) Besides that, I got about 5 years on me
(Run!) Scared to death, runnin' like I got bears on me
(Run!) My Timb's start feelin' like they Nike Air's on me
(Run!) It's hard for me to slow down, it's like I'm on the throughway
My belt's in the crib on the floor by my two-way
Now I'm try'nna hold my hammer up, and my pants too
If they don't kill me, they gon' give me a number I can't do
Rather it be the streets, then jail where I die at
And I'm asthmatic, so I'm lookin' for somewhere to hide at
But they too close, and I got this new toast
'Magine if I would of let off a shot or two, you know what I gotta do
Free hold east coast whole, boxing the Philly down
Down to Dela', when y'all rarely toting the milli round
I bring the milli to ya house, I was just down south
Carolina had the milli down there
Pearl Beach had the heater in reach, and four freaks
In Hooters, I made 'em lose it when they heard freedom of speech
Told them freaks that I gotta run, I'm on the run
But they tried to make me stay, they showed me two hooters a piece
I stayed for a second but you know I gotta skate
It's like a race, cops chase me, I'm chasing the moon
Before I left the premise, saw two more bitches
They told me they was witches, told me hop on they broom
I did, and then we went zoom
Don't you know them witches got me outtie wit the quickness
I'm buggin', I'm trippin' in reality I'm skitzin'
The cops got me trapped in the Audi wit the Smith and

D-Boy, yeah, Birdman Jr. in ya building, people
I'm a let you know how it go on my side of the mountain, whoadie
It's sure about does that you heard me
And I dropped in effect since 9/11
I'm on the avenue with nines, elevens, I'm a two times felon
That's why I keep the top up, on my 9-11
Pele, in New Orleans, ain't got no Rico law
So I keep that heat in the car, but they don't know
I had that 'dro in the seat of the car
But it's hot right now, so you can see me tomorrow
Ay, Ghostface, the youngins on the block duckin' blue and red lights
While your boy bypassing fare light
But if them cock suckers ever get me dead right
Three hots and the cops swallow weed and a knife, right?
I speed at night, take it easy in the day
Go hard wit the dough, take it easy wit the yae
Yup, Lil' Weezy, I get my loot up
But at the pull up, come, I say my crew run run, boy",https://genius.com/Jadakiss-run-lyrics

I'm in the lower millions I'm tryin to get in the hundreds
Niggas pants too tight to fight, so they don't want it
Pay for somebody to protect you so where your gun at?
Been there done that, seen the coke come back
Seen niggas come home from jail then run back
Singin the same sad song my nigga won that
Negative energy stick to him like a thumb tack
Real hustler probably sold a milion and one packs
Niggas think they smart and nice but they dumb wack
It's only 'til you crack they skull give 'em a mumwrap
When it's cold I reside wherever the sun's at

All I gotta do is look a certain way and you'll bleed
Four words describe me, niggas can't fuck around
Fishscale verses, prices go up and down
Put it out there, see if it taste right
Young Jewish bulldog keepin the case right
Apartment on the fourth floor keepin the base right
Jacksons and Benjamins keepin the safe right
First and the fifteenth is when we break nights
Bunch of red beams on your head like break lights
Bitches that fucked everybody turned into fake dykes
Plus bitin a whole day it's 'gon be a great night

Calico's in the plastic stacks in the duffle
Niggas comin through gettin racks off the muscle

The industry is hurt they lookin for the next Russell
The hip hop cops outside waitin to cuff you
The Bloods is on Rikers Island waitin to touch you

I Need You,UnKnown,2018.0,"I need you, not me
It's not me, it's who got me
To hold me
To scold me
(That's some deep shit right there, Nino)
'Cause when I'm 
(Yonkers to Harlem)
(You a bad mother fucker)
You ready, 

Growin' up with an older mental, your destiny really depends on what you been through
Wordplay, breath control, controllin' the tempo
In the hood it's like respect is your only credentials
Weed, liquor, and a gun are the only essentials
'Til you do somethin' dumb 'cause your homie convinced you
Put two behind the walls, they waitin' to  you
Plus you all washed up, they just waitin' to wrench you
Tryna stand up straight but the hatin' will bend you
In a different tax bracket, how can they offend you?
If everything they drop is ratchet, how can they continue?
Master of the ceremony, I'm ownin' the venue
The sword is might but I know you know what the pen do
Kinda hard to figure out but you know that it's simple
Catch a bullet in the head, that's a hole in the temple
This a fucked up game but it's so influential
Come across the same sample, its coincidental
I pay a flight, room and board with no incidentals

Tryna get it all right 'fore I leave you
This rap shit is my life and I need you
If I did it out of spite, I ain't need to
Words of advice, the team heeds you
Tryna get it all right 'fore I leave you
This rap shit is my life and I need you
I could feel it in the air when I breeze through
I don't really care what it leads to
Tryna get it all right 'fore I leave you
This rap shit is my life and I need you
Never bite that hand that'll feed you
Go livin' off the land if I need to
Tryna get it all right 'fore I leave you
This rap shit is my life and I need you

Uh, growin' up with a older mental
So official that I'mma pull in a roll of tissue
Mo' money, mo' problems, little niggas know the issues
The same happen to me, then the homies know to get you
So much sun, I'mma make it and you gon' watch me do it
It's just all about focus and you can't stop us doin' it
You can't stop, just like the cops can't stop the shootin'
Comin' at me is a no-no and I'm not refusin'
Been up and coming for a minute and I'm still leadin'
Y'all know I'm in and out the trap, I heard they still fiendin'
You was never ballin' with us, you was chair leadin'
Niggas think the trap is dead that shit is still breathin'
They say, ""Nino Man, you act like you don't know nobody""
I said, ""Nah, I just act like I don't own nobody""
They see the different color belts like I know Karate
Didn't greet me when I was broke, now they know somebody
They know before I ran the block, I controlled the lobby
And I already know what's up, don't gotta know to find me
Tryna be here for a while, not breeze through
This rap shit is my life and I need you

If I did it out of spite, I ain't need to
Words of advice, the team heeds you
Tryna get it all right 'fore I leave you
This rap shit is my life and I need you
I could feel it in the air when I breeze through
I don't really care what it leads to
Tryna get it all right 'fore I leave you

You booked a session for me to lay something for the album to hop on the joint
But this 'rona shit is dead serious
They're telling people to stay inside, it ain't safe
Shit might be airborne or whatever, so
I ain't gon' be able to make it
But I was gonna say some ill shit

They got me Googling my own name every two weeks
See what they got to say about a nigga, any new leaks
Shit poppin', shit is real, shit's droppin'
Lookin' for our black leaders, but they TikTokkin'
Flip-floppin', the bosses are now threatened
A time in the world where a cough is now a weapon
Appreciate all them tough times, that was a blessin'
'Cause those that had to grow up soft is now regrettin'
Why in the black neighborhood the virus hit different?
Then when they find the vaccine, it got the chip in it
The money comes and it goes, the love is infinite
Some things ain't gotta be touched to put your strength in it

Couple birds in the bag couple bags of the kush
Gucci Mane and Jadakiss, yeah we armed and dangerous
Got to be a dope boy, weed seller to hang with us
And this purp is really loud and my diamonds really loud
Turn the shit down, passing kush out to the crowd
And I'm too turnt up you can't really turn me down

Sunday night and I'm not working so I drop my top on purpose
I got white I got green I got purple I got brown
Clientele all through the city nigga Gucci get around

No you can't come in
If you sell a nick nigga I want in
Got two hundred pounds that just came in
She just popped a pill and it just kicked in
I used to sell breakdowns until nights end
Now I got a trap house on that dead end
If you ain't buying dope then you ain't my friend
It's a pool full of sharks nigga go dive in

Bottles every night different women every night
Pool full of sharks nigga screaming for his life
If it's loud enough I can move ten of 'em tonight
Balling, Imma Jeremy Lin-em for the night
You don't really know him never send him for the white
Say the Lakers need to trade Kobe send him for Dwight
Lil' something for your nose, lil' something for your Sprite
Get it how you live you can pump it all your life
Getting two for fives, yeah, three for tens
If you ain't coppin' hell nah we ain't friends
King of New York that's what I've been
If a nickel bag sold in the park I want in

Pop off leave them boys paralyzed below the waist
Dope money, street money, even more up in Chase
Lawyer money on deck ain't worried 'bout a fucking case
We let that sour burn, we been the nicest in the game for all these years and I still don't feel it's our turn
Rollie underneath the cardigan, thousand single in my hand
Let them stripping bitches know it's on again
And my chain gon' keep on glowing, popping pills, Dutch blowing Any hood that I'm in you see that Desert handle showing
I'm a beast mother fucker, you can't do it like this

Hard like Willis Reed I'll keep the score and the lead

Beside family the only thing that's on

He got love for the game
His start was huge
And you seen him play hurt cause his heart is huge

And ain't no payment plans its full purse-full


A'yo I'm dealin with this mami from Quebec
When she fly out I pull the boat out and blow scomie on the deck
Shootin at the stars, Tommy and the Tek
Soon as the dutch finish you can find me on the neck
No foreplay, bustin the pound raise me
Middle of the ocean, bustin her down crazy
You know me, I ain't on no star shit
I just came to hurt the market
Then squirt the Larkin
Put your hands up, matter fact put your mans up
Put your medina's and your lambs up, your grams up
Talkin bout buckin each other
Probly fuckin each other
D-Block dawg, we stuck with each other


A'yo Full Surface, Swizz Beatz is in front of him
Got alot of problems but money ain't one of 'em
D 12's and up, thats our M-O
Tell me what you know bout a jet ski limo
Waterproof knockin it, ain't no stoppin it
Automatic respect whenever D-Block's in it
Or we can take it to the avenue too
Bring the Porsche GT out, lavender blue
Shit change, Kiss came its all extortion
Everybody meet, except for smaller portions
For real though, behave yourself on some grown shit
It ain't enough room dawg, I'm on my own hit

If you want it, come get it
If you want it, come get it
If you want it, come get it (New York City must be)

Yeah, you can dance if you want to
But you really don't have to dance
See you got your eyes on the hustlers, you just wanna touch us
C'mon with the lump in your pants
See, I ain't gon' stress ya
But I know my glow got you under pressure
You already know that the flow is extra
Stand right here so the blocks can catch ya, listen

C'mon, c'mon.. naw, uh-huh
You know, AH-HAH! Uh, yo
If you wan' take a picture with money then stand right here
You see all eyes is on the man right here
Us hookin up is the plan I swear
And you ain't gotta dance, you could stand right there
Nice hips plus she got an ass to lean on
Type of honey that you wanna flash the green on
Real New Yorker, brilliant author
The work still on the same scale as Orca
Still sellin the kush and lightin the sour
Still in the hood gettin right with the powder
So it ain't no need in fightin the power
Cause the flicks'll be up on every site in an hour, c'mon


Uh-uh, uh-huh, know, AH-HAH!
Uh, yo - J to the MWAH
I'm one of the best in world ma, that's what they say on the blogs
Look in the garage, half of the cars
Off the bars, and the other half off the mall
My entourage is large, so hard
'Kiss run the streets, my niggas run the yard
Whoever disagree could bet they get scarred
We keep it so rugged but we still so suave
Just seen your girl, 'bout to give me a massage
Her friend wanna join, 'bout to make it a ménage
Let the desert off for the sake of the mirage
Cause it all look good, until the Louis 
lands far
, yeah



Uh-uh, uh-huh, you know, AH-HAH!
Uhh, yeah, yo - flow extra, dough extra
They recognize the glow no matter who he's next to
Recognized your ho, then he probably sexed her
All my hood niggas gettin money, throw your sets up
You know what it is with the kid, put your bets up
Honey wanna slide but I got her under pressure
Keep tryin to tell her that I ain't tryin to stress her

Double R, ride out

Inquiring minds wanna know
Everybody wanna blow, every nigga that hustle wanna O
Every RnB diva's a freak on the low
Take a real special nigga to grind and get it slow
Most dudes get caught in they feelings
And react off emotions, damn near resort to killing
See me i'm strictly 'bout my bread
Niggas and family, everything else is dead
After the state, everything else is feds
After the hawk everything else is lead
Outside of the bentley coupe
It's milk white with chrome stocks, everything else is red
Yeah, Kiss shit blazin, i copped your new shit
I hated the songs but the skits was amazing
Back by popular demand of the hood
Mean oufit half ounce hammer and I'm good
Better start using your head
And I can't name 10 hot rappers without including the dead
I can move the haze and hard white and be fine
But after 10 years i just want what's rightfully mine
It's a shame that i feel like that
But the truth is June 15th I'ma feel like Gap, what
Just, just warn 'em, whoever ya'll think can spit I'll spit on 'em
Niggas tryna drop they shit, just warn 'em

I know where you stay and where your kids rest
You know my name yo 
I ain't playing games ho

Cause ain't afraid to put 50 on your brains ho 

Kiss is a hardcore nigga in general
Cause I slap you five and still put ten in you
And I'm still in the hood right there clocking em'
Shorty got the pack but I'm right there watching em'
Can't wait for one of ya'll faggot niggas to come through
So I can let the 40 cal stop a nigga oxygen

Kids in the microwave baby mother in the oven
After we made love and
Now that's what I call thuggin' (3x)

Some of us is out here, some is in the pen now
Buttons (?) cost six sacks cost ten now
One nigga violate they all could get it 
Burning up in a old jail the walls are sweatin
Find your way in the D-Block

Champ is Here mixtape!
Green Lantern, Big Mike
Jadakiss, ah-hah!
I'd like to thank y'all for coming out tonight
You know, I'd like to thank y'all
For rocking with me
Supporting that Kiss of Death album
Supporting Ruff Ryders
Supporting D-Block
But right now we 'gon go back
You know I ain't that old or nuttin'
But I got a keen memory ya heard
Ah-hah!

My aim is to get y'all open
Early 80's, coke was fluffy, way more potent
Moc necks, knitteds, BK's, British
One big party, 
Plus the EK's was out too
The way money was coming
No way they could doubt you
BVD's over the white tee's
Kangol buckets, pinstripe Lee's
Then niggas switched the set
To the college hats, Avia's, Discus sweats
It's coming back clearer
Niggas was pushing the big 9-8's
With the little dogs in the mirror
They gotta argue while they gamble
Before the philly and the dutch
Niggas rolled up in bamboo
Reason everybody was fresh
Grams was like 17 dollars or less

Way more beat downs than pistols popping

Time’s Up - Nate Dogg,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Yeah, yo, I'm the nigga with the perpetual oyster bars
Mother of pearl delivery, voice of God
And...it's hard just being the boss
Being I can't go to jail cause them years'll cost me
Don't get me wrong, lay a nigga down if he force me
Rather just sit back and roll a dutch
Think how I'ma put the game in the cobra clutch
Think about how I'ma get the 'caine over Customs
Never underestimate niggas, or over trust them
Uh...yeah them M's is right in my face
I just gotta throw my Timbs on and tighten my lace
If it don't jam, the Tech will spray
When I spit everybody gotta split like pepper spray
Cause I'm a nigga that hate to settle
I'm a man of the Lord but I still can't shake the devil
Moved away and still can't escape the ghetto, what

The time to talk is up
So bring the heat, that time is over
While you running your mouth I'm creeping up over your shoulder
A gun, a knife, a bat, a brick, anything I can get my hands on
Call my bluff, start acting up, and I'll leave you underground
I know how to get my pairs off me
They can cry and die from high blood pressure cause tears are salty
It's a symptom if you bobbin your head
Know that he's sick, know the flow is ridic', now throw him a grip
When I get it, you already know I'm throwin them bricks
Puttin purple everywhere, daddy, I'm throwin them nicks
That's right, homey, you can't move me
I ain't goin nowhere, I'm in the hood like bootleg movies
All you shootin is the breeze, a bootleg uzi
I'm just waitin on a que like Suzie, don't lose me
These penitentiary chances that I take
Should be able to get the mansion by the lake
But I invest my bread into something else
Into something else that'll make something melt
You just gotta feel the kid
If not rap for the fact of how real he is, whatever

Aiyo, niggas know the champ is in here
He took it from crack to rap, now he put out two anthems a year
And I just wanna rock for a century
Then chase the book with the documentary
If you, can't do nothin other than flow
Life's a bitch like the mother from +Blow+, let's go
Don't make me put your heart in your lap
Fuck ridin the beat, nigga, I parallel park on the track
Hop out lookin crispy, fresh and new
In the six, but it's a BM, and it's Pepsi blue
And, I don't know you
But I know a man becomes a man from all the shit that he go through
Ya'll ain't fuckin with Jason
After I cash in, there's really no justification
Of how I'm gonna change the game, so don't get outta line

A'yo the crib got your friends workin
We travel to France for French curtains
You was there when I was on the bench hurtin
Now that I own my team
It's only right that I condone my queen
Try to show her my dream
And I can't let her get lost now
She carries the money, the hammers and material across town
And understands she's fine
And understands she's mine
She understands the grind
Cook cleans and irons
And whatever she wanna push

And if I ain't got it already
Then I'ma go find it
I guess I'ma lucky don
And she a lucky queen
Cause her jewelry box looks like lucky charms
All color stones

You let me know exactly how the ladies would respond
From a woman's point of view
And that's why my girlie is hear with me
I love it when she layin' in the bed with her ____ Vicky
The next best thing to a soldier
Go hard with a fat ass and a head full of rollers
Just look in her eyes and tell she's real
Just imagine the way she smell and the way she feel
And the sex was crazy then and its crazy still
And you know I'm from the streets so it's crazy ill

When it comes from the heart it's more pleasure
And for the fact that you trust me still
Thus far I appreciate what we've built
All the minks that I bought you that drag the floor
And all the nights that you sat up and bagged the raw

You're not dead lil' bruh
You are brown when this world is black and white lil' bruh
I know how it sounds low lil' bruh
But you'll be alright lil' bruh
At times I know life can seem miserable
But lil' bruh you got a lot of more living to do
You gotta go get it, they ain't gonna give it to you
Just watch what you say, and watch who you deliver it to
Put something away, cuz you'll never know when it rains
And you could never feel the love without knowing the pain
Bracelet and the pinky ring, go with the chain
These the different kind of jewels though, that go in your brain
Pray for your downfall, when you doing your thing
If something happens while you in charge then you was to blame
The less ? the better, stay fly get chedda'
Don't expect the V I or letter
When you get 'em never let up, when you fall get up
Wipe the tears off, get the blood and the sweat up
If you don't say nothing, can't be set up
Always stand tall, make sure you hold your head up
Hold your head lil' bruh (you don't stop)

You are brown when this world is black and white lil' bruh

Yeah, ain't nobody gon' front you
There's money out here and you could get it if you want to
Or you can keep sitting around, saying what you're gonna do
If you don't pay attention, it's gonna come back to haunt you
Make saving one of your habits
Never keep the razors and plates under the cabinet
You can get further in life by using manners
Not only are these cellphones tapped they using scanners
Never use your own address, use your nana's
And if you ever have to pull it out, use your hammer
Yeah, white paper or dutch it
Ha, automatic or clutching
Once you put it away don't touch it
Let it come to you don't rush it
Accumulate more than enough shit
Then you get in the building and crush shit

Take pride in the joint when you're mopping it
Kiss melts in your mouth like chocolate
Make sure it's hot whenever you're dropping it

You ain't in the boys club, you just copped the fifth
I'm two-stepping in, honey popping in
Your first was the worst now it's the opposite
Yes, I must confess girl
You're now rocking with the best, girl

What it do shorty? What's happening?
You know this beats jamming, it's remarkable
Everybody looking, what you gonna do?

Niggas hitting me, texting me, emailing
I'm like ""for what?""

Coming home, a little bigger with waves and paroles

Gangs in new York, a lot of soft niggas signed up
Nothing like the feeling you get, when you bust the K
I can do back to back bullets, won't touch a tray
Me Gus and K, rude pimping
And a big shipment of something that taste different
Hollow tips turn grown men back into infants
Two trap houses, Greensboro and Winston
Some is behind a wall, other niggas is fenced in
Couple of em just touched down that just did ten
Cut ain't bad enough for staples you get stitched in
Lucky that the doctor was even able to fix him
Yeah...What the fuck did you tell me?
Red and green stripe on the capital LV
If I don't make it all that means is I failed me
So either I make a hit record or sell D
I'm tryna do both
Bars, top of the line, 'bout a nine or the dope
Balcony, looking at your mind through the scope
Devil telling me ""do it""but the angels saying ""no""
Made it out the jail, you lucky nobody cut you
You going to the hole, screaming and nobody touch you
Looking for the foul, and that's where the trouble 's at
Say death comes in threes, but I can double that
Any narcotic in the world, I can bubble that

You know they say if you don't stand for nothing
You'll fall for anything
Preferably I'd rather hustle than do stick ups
Call me, your number's blocked, I ain't gon' pick up
This is much more than you seeing
And you touch more when you ringing
I'm in a four door european
Still going through the nonsense y'all
Listening to niggas bullshitting on the conference call
Till you leave them with open flesh
My base got the fiends damn near
Smoking they self to death
You can feel it inside you heart
My life is a double edged sword
And both sides are sharp
It's facts in the talk
I'm the only nigga right now
That can bring the game back to New York
And I don't wanna hear jack
You got a gun? Where it at?
Coupe is the same color as the nine-five Air Max
Yeah I'm a gentle boss that'll send you back to heaven
Make a nigga dental floss with the Mac-11
In front of the store, breaking down on a crate
I'm working out now and not eating after eight
Let 'em know I'm a monster right now
And the empire's about to be conquered right now
And all you gon' hear about is Yonkers right now
And I own a couple pair of shoes...
Yeah but I'm the don of Nike Town
The haze is purple, the diesel is sour

I ain't just up here, rappin' and tappin'
Spittin' and skittin' and shit, naw, not me
I'm not you, I'm not you rapper, I'm not you, Pusha
I keep that ziploc bustin' at the stitches, culinary chemist
I serve the malicious to break the fiends fixes
One give you the sniffles, the other leave you with the itches
Transport, airport with the vaseline
So I can fulfill my dreams of passion as green
More cash then ya seen within Ashton it's green
Me drivin' up fast with the lean, zonin' family
Keep youngin's in them rented Camry's
Door panels full of shit and I ain't full of shit
Reckless ass, God forbid they don't crash
From the panel to the dash, it's four pounds of slab
Naw, bitch we don't believe in air bags
Cars turn tricks like them Ringling brother skits
Whether bitch hop out or the Glock pop out
Ya know, what I'm about
Blow to ya sinus 'til the snot drop out
Whoever said birds fly south for the winters, a damn lie
Got 'em right here and if I don't like you the grams high
Take it or leave it, soon as a fiend, taste it, they need it
They could smoke it right in front of you to make you believe it
Prolly think, I won't murder you the way I smile
But I'ma take a lota shots, A I style
Jada, the name is filthy but so what
The motherfuckin' game is filthy
You know, what? My mom and my pops really did a good job
But it was the Montega and the Cane the built me
So I could never hate on another brother
God is great, the devil is a motherfucker
When you broke but they think you got money
Crackers start showin' you love, ya own people act funny
I tear niggas heads off, I don't discriminate
Waves, cornrows or dreads, I will eliminate
I'm far from a noodle, nigga, I stab up block reps
And turn quiet streets into hot sex
Nigga, that's funny you say you a killa, how?
What is it the return of the killer clown?
You don't put no fear in my heart
I make ya people say, 'wow', that didn't look like my man
They flipped upside down, the coroner did what he can
He got hit wit ten rounds at pointblank and pointblank
Coldchian left that nigga stankin'
Half static and face I got the wrinkling, slugs all in it
I had my eyes on his mink and I didn't give 'em
A chance to blink when I dodged up on 'em
Pressed the forty up on him shocked 'em
Made his head stand on end and like a baby I rocked 'em
The Coffin, the cradle, you can't bite the hand that made you
That's the beginning of the end and you a thug that pretends
Carl Coldchain, suit the nigga, I got a great vision I see through men
And squeeze triggers wit' bullets that go through men
Fuck wit S P, that's ya date with death
Got bullets that'll grape ya chest, no sleep like I hate the rest
I'm in the hood like it's my fate to rep
I hold it down any place I step and I love gettin' slept on
'Cause I'm rawer than dope fresh outta Africa that never been stepped on
Dog, I'ma clap at you the minute that you rep wrong
Holiday, the ghost the main reason why ya set gone
Why I love riffin', the war you wouldn't understand
'Cause my God is different than yours
If the world spin in a circle, I want 'em to learn move backwards
Kill niggas the first minute they jerk you
What you keep the toaster for creepin' through the hood
And shit ain't really good but I'm deeper than the ocean floor
Higher than a plane and meaner than a baller
Want ya insides out so I mean it when I pull
Rappers is talking to me as if, come on
We in the same boat, I tell them quick, no, I move Coke
And you and I don't share no common bond
So forgive me if I don't receive you with open arms, no
It shames me to no end to feed poison
To those who could very well be my kin
But where there's demand, someone will supply
So I feed them their needs at the same time cry
Yes, it pains me to see them need this
All of them lost souls and I'm their Jesus
Deepest regret and sympathy to the street
I see them pay for they fix when they kids couldn't eat, so sorry
And with this in mind, I still didn't quit
And that's how I know that I ain't shit, I ain't shit
My heart bleed but that's aside from the fact
I live from my kids and their's and them youngin's after that",https://genius.com/Jadakiss-im-not-you-lyrics

Eh-heee (Green Lantern)

Yo, it's too hot, no hammer just two hawks with me
Call me when it's no coke in New York City
Call me when it's no haze in Washington Heights
Crispy hundred to a crackhead for washing a bike
You could get yourself murdered just for squashing a fight
Usually could get away from the narcs in your nike's
I don't give a fuck if you do wrong or do right
Go to Willard catch a  do life
I'm out here with these fat asses and this ice
And this money, and these whips nigga rolling a dice
Industry is somewhat like controlling the heist
Couple crackers you'll never meet controlling your life
The other niggas is corns, sworn in pawns
Secret society of devils with no horns
Counting stacks in the back of the villa
With the chrome I'm the 44 caliber killer
Leave your dome right there on the side of your pillow
Nobody is iller, I'm a wolf mixed with a gorilla
Puff a joint while I'm sipping a Miller
On a mink sofa sitting on chinchilla
Every verse deserves a pull back
Listen up I don't represent that bull crap
Every verse deserves a pull back
Listen up I don't represent that bull crap
Love is a good strong hug and a full dap
For some people death is considered a full nap
And I'm anti ringtone, I still move around with the thing holmes
The money's tax free that I bring home
Shout out to the state pens, all of the fed joints
Either the hollow heads or the regular lead joints
Fresher than Easter, still give 50 a feature, yeah even in a recession
I stay happy even in a depression
It ain't safe around me in a session
Niggas better get out and vote or learn a lesson (vote)
And get off your ass and stop stressing
Or just watch the coke rise
Crib on the water, everyday is a boat ride
If you're Tony, guess that must make me Sosa
This is the D-Block, La Cosa Nostra
Devilish bastard, tell niggas to find something to fall back on besides the casket

Be ghetto like fishin' a nigga's 6 l's down in soup
Nuke palm size,45, just came chrome
You don't know the streets is mine, you just came home
Even though it's def poetry, this ain't no poem
I'm the motherfuckin' champ, nigga, ain't no throne
Just a whole, blood and tissue, ain't no bone
Because a hallow tip shattered it, but life goes on
Number one debut, they think I'm another man
Counting so much money, I need me another hand
Niggas is still schemin', atleast they still tryin'
If they ain't doin' nothin' else, atleast they still dyin'
Coke is still highin', purple is still movin'

Lay Em Down,I Love You (A Dedication To My Fans),2011.0,"(I just wanna tell you that I love you)
(And I appreciate everything you've done for me thus far)

When they ask we don't play around
Load up, roll up, and then we lay 'em down
Niggas hustle on the block with them thangs round
Keep the fast cake, keep a choppa' just to lay em down
If he try, give that lame a lullaby
Make him touch the sky, and if he gotta we lay em down
Trust me, if I gotta spray the pound
I won't hesitate for one second, to lay 'em down
Another man down let me see you try to live through 'em
I had the whole town talking 'bout what you did to 'em
Funny how quickly they forget what I give to 'em
Life or dead situations I had us live through 'em
Still let the ? off
Couple more to pick off
When the drama is lit you can't cut the wick off
Streets taught him well, learnt it until it cost him
Reciprocated the hate and turned it into a fortune
Never woulda tried his hand, but they forced him
So right after they fried his man, then they off'ed him
Yeah you know the trees, the mink stop right below the knees
Four door shit from overseas
Underboss from the other side
Blame me when you hear that they killed his whole mother's side
Never the money, always for the love of it
After you put 'em to bed, I sing 'em a lullaby
Mwah

Give that lame a lullaby, bed time story
You wouldn't die to do fed time for me
You gon' fuck around and make the headline story
Bitch in the whip, lettin' it redline for me
Fuck ? get somethin' on the freeway, sucka free
Five less than twenty for the bird, nigga fuck wit me
Three less than six for the P, get it on the arm
Organic dope, cuz you can get it on the farm
I'm a Godfather, I'm a Don
My ? is my word, word is my ?
Can't be stopped in the first, or the fourth quarter
Work coming in on the dock, now that's a boss order
Big diamonds, clear like VOS water
Payin' money to the judge fuck a court order
Do it big like Frank White
And the K 'll put your brains on the floor, like it ain't right",https://genius.com/Jadakiss-lay-em-down-lyrics
Illegal Business,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Cocaine business controls America
Ganja business controls America
KRS-One come to start some hysteria
Illegal business controls America

One afternoon around eleven o'clock
It was freezin cold, he was standing on the block
Sellin cheeba, nick's and dimes
Sayin a rhyme just to pass the time
The cops passed by, but he stayed calm
Cause the leather trench coat was keepin him warm
But this time they walked by real slowly
He thought to himself, ""They look like they know me""
They drove away, but he didn't stay
He jumped in the cab and he paid his tab
But guess who he saw when he hit the block
It was the same cop car, the same two cops
They jumped out quick, they pulled a gun
They said, ""Don't try to fight and don't try to run
Cooperate and we will be your friend
Non-cooperation will be your end""
He jumped in the car, and while they rode
They ran down the list of things he owed
They said, ""You owe us some money, you owe us some product
Cause you could be right in the river tied up""
He thought for a second and he said, ""What is this?
You want me to pay you to stay in business?""
They said, ""That's right, or you go to prison
Cause nobody out there is really gonna listen
To a hood,"" so he said, ""Good!
I'll pay you off for the whole neighborhood""

{*DJ scratches ""What can we get for 63 cents?""*}

A guy named Jack, is sellin crack
The community, doesn't want him back
He sells at work, he sells in schools
He's not stupid, the cops are the fools
Cause everyone else seems to go to jail
But when it comes to Jack, the cops just fail
They can't arrest him, they cannot stop him
Cause even in jail the bail unlocks him
So here is the deal, and here is the facts
If you ever wonder why they can't stop crack
The police department, is like a crew
It does whatever they want to do
In society you have illegal and legal
We need both, to make things equal
So legal is tobacco, illegal is speed
Legal is aspirin, illegal is weed
Crack is illegal, cause they cannot stop ya
But cocaine is legal if it's owned by a doctor
Everything you do in private is illegal
Everything's legal if the government can see you
Don't get me wrong, America is great place to live
But listen to the knowledge I give
Cocaine business controls America

Hey yo Part 2 AI and Jadakiss presenting the A6 from the wrist

Soon as you try to guard up you ain't got a chance to stop it
Any given time he can pop it
The Reebok A6 is hot go cop it!

For 2K3 I rock the A6 my new kicks
Take a few hits, it ain't nothin I'm used to it
Tryin' to build a team I'm the player ya need
Heart like Willis Reed top thief and scorer in the league

There's no way to disguise your dream
Besides family the only thing on his mind now is a ring
He got love for the game his start was huge
And you seen him play hurt cause he has heart is huge
Six foot 165 call Iso anytime he want he'll split your 5
He play to win he don't play for stats
Brought the hood to the game, and they love him for the braids and tats
Yeah Trackmasters AI and Jadakiss
Make sure you go out and get a pair of the A6!

What It Is,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Game wasn't half bad until the faggots came
Got the weed man meeting me at baggage claim
Been the same way never has the status changed
So when I tell you I love you that explains
Why I'm trying to get the pesos, moving the ye slow
Sam Quentin bars with the Pelican Bay flow
Tougher than a lackey, chucks and the khakis
Representing for niggas chino to ??? ???
Sales took a decline I got the dope workin'
Who else better to be the hood spokesperson
Knife to the neck got your throat squirtin'
Hopefully you dead on arrival closed curtains
Ya, I'm a be in the red faded
Rip a Dre track like I was there when he made it
Everywhere you look I'm right there and you hate it
If it's good then cop it I don't care what the weight is
It could happen so don't chance him
I make goon music and they all anthems
Some niggas pay bills some niggas pay ransoms
I don't just sell my bricks I advance 'em
I don't just break new artists I enhance 'em
Any time I'm with the devil I'm dancin
Ya, I got extra jewels on
A lot of these niggas be pussy plus they move wrong
That's why they be the dudes that get moved on
Big picture of them when they turn the news on
Work comin from The Bay and from Towson
In case a nigga get in the way you know what to do to 'em
Move on to the next mission
I'm gettin money though nah I ain't set trippin'
I'm just sayin that's what it is
You ain't going to have a problem paying if you love the kids
Bar shit homey
In the Beverly center with the four fifth homey
I was holding a cig
East side 400 strong over the bridge
Dust jewels too powerful to go in the fridge
I'm a go in your girl's mouth then go in her ribs
Besides money I ain't bring shit
Except for the 3 piece and the wing tips
Pockets square and the ????

And everybody ate but he ain't even had dinner yet

State yo' name gangsta (Jadakiss nigga)
Where you representin? (East coast dawg)
You gon' hold it down? (Why wouldn't I?)
Enough said then nigga (Let's go)
(Let's go)
If you f*ckin wit the 'Kiss, you ain't gon' breathe
The only time I lick in the air is New Year's Eve
Sonny from ""Bronx Tale,"" you can't leave
Get kissed on yo' cheek then you meant to die
Cause when the gun start poppin then my temperature rise
You know my style; 20 niggas wit 40 Cals
Nine years ago you was hollerin shorty wild
Now I'm in the rap game twistin these honies out
Never left the crack game still on a money route
I run through the industry looking for enemies
Y'all niggas sound sick and Jada the remedy
Get shot in yo' eyes and mouth
Can't see can't talk when you f*ckin wit the heart of New York
And that's fouler that swallowin pork
And to f*ck wit the feds dog
You know I push the prowler to court
Toast on my lap, got the East Coast on my back, UH
How many times must I tell you motherf*ckers
We ain't industry niggas
We in-the-STREETS, niggas - you motherf*ckin right!
Ruff Ryders forever, yeah bitch - now what?
Ryde.. or.. Die.. you talk it, we live it (East COAST!)
So Ryde.. or.. Die.. you want it, we give it (West COAST!)
So Ryde.. or.. Die.. you start it, we end it (Dirty SOUTH!)

My Buddy,The Champ Is Here,2004.0,"I don't take a lot of advice
My lifestyle's product and dice
And guns that'll target your pipe
It's sort of life approaching the don
Wrong word, wrong vibe
Four-five will leave most of you harmed
Move coke through the ocean
Paid off the coast guard
Sailed out to Cuba made dure shit's potent
Violence with caution
And ain't too many niggas you know
That got polished transporting
Egg-nog whip, four door Ferrari
Two M16's, I beg ya'll flip
I'm the hardest nigga you know
Check it out, turned forty keys to eighty
When I get in the dough
So I flash like cameras, blast like hammers
I worry 'bout you lil niggas just like your grandmas
Get shit jumping like the play offs
Every twenty minutes a day
Give or take, I knock a K off
Been in the hood for real long
Catch me anywhere and I got a half a mil on
Jada, kiss you now, you die now
Why later? Double R and D-Block

All these sweet ass niggas give me space
Basic look, something light but I'm heavy at chase
Let the nine blow out your face
Better hope I roll 4,5,6, cause it's on if I ace
Motherfuckers ain't hard, you pussy god
I treat the whole New York like the yard
Stick to myself, nigga front, Sheek pulling his card
I don't think these niggas got brains
Knowing that I'm working with, ahh, little bit of change
And will hop out the drivers side of the Range
And shoot all around like a young Dan Ainge
Sheek get it popping like a dope head's veins
With two dancers with me but not like Kane's
You as fake as these T.V. shows
I ain't watching but I know how the ending goes
Mad holes through the side of your Benz
Everybody running off, nothing like the finale of Friends
You talk greezy but it's only talk
You don't mean no harm like George do Weezie
When Sheek have beef it's like Dre and Eazy
Big and Pac, somebody better leave me
It's D-Block, celebrate nigga
Everything cool, I got my smoke and lil bit of liquor",https://genius.com/Jadakiss-my-buddy-lyrics

He felt that line just as well as you felt it
This is when I was thinkin’ about it
That was a pat on the back for me
I felt good getting a call from one of my colleagues that I got a lot of respect for to feel that bar right there
That probably helped to get him on there, liking that joint.""",https://genius.com/Jadakiss-about-eminem-times-up-rhyme-lyrics

Take a flight, hustle all the time, from the day to night
Im on my come up, these cowards wanna take it light
Take a homie I can make it right
Take a quiet trip, nigga to a poppin' block
Burners on deck, perimeter good, got it loud
These dudes is taking in shit real, have 14 shooters in 2 days
Brick city, my mind state is stuck there
Until I get to get away, and get enough air
Try to feel me, so many safari tales
Got the hammers there, homie so we
I dont do a lot of talking, I ain't for words
Smoke my herb, never pay attention to these nerds
Kee it moving if it ain't about fetti talk
Out of line, get my young boy to let the Desi talk

You ain't gonna suffer so you ain't got to worry
Ima give you that strong shit, doctor Murray
Catch me over the stove, my work of glass
I dont care about your name nigga, first or last
Im just here to damage your future and hurt your past

Fifth by the pelvis

Try to talk to em and give em something, they helpless
Old school with the rebuilt engine
And they look like Levis but they rebuilt denim
Look a coward in the eye, you could see guilt in em
I done dealt with a snake, I could see real venom
And I ain't got time for the slammer
I ain't worried bout the 3 years, I'm worried bout my hammer

Why - Anthony Hamilton,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Aha
It's dat real
Yo, why is Jadakiss as hard as it gets
Why is the industry designed to keep the artist in debt
And why them dudes ain't ridin' if there part of your set
And why they never get it poppin' but they party to death
Yea, and why they gon give you life for a murder
Turn around only give you eight months for a burner, it's goin down
Why they sellin' niggas CD's for under a dime
If it's all love daddy why you come wit your nine
Why my niggas ain't get that cake
Why is a brother up North better than Jordan
That ain't get that break
Why you ain't stackin' instead of tryin' to be fly
Why is rattin' at an all time high
Why are you even alive
Why they kill 2Pac n' Chris
Why at the bar you ain't take straight shots instead of poppin Crist'
Why them bullets have to hit that door
Why did Kobe have to hit that raw
Why he kiss that whore
Why

All that I been givin'
Is this thing that I've been living
They got me in the system
Why they gotta do me like that
Try'd to make it my way
But got sent up on the highway
Why, oh why
Why they gotta do me like that

Why would niggas push pounds and powder
Why did bush knock down the towers
Why you around them cowards
Why Aaliyah have to take that flight
Why my nigga D ain't pull out his Ferrari
Why he take that bike
Why they gotta open your package and read your mail
Why they stop lettin' niggas get degreez in jail
Why you gotta do eighty-five percent of your time
And why do niggas lie in eighty-five percent of they rhymes
Why a nigga always want what he can't have
Why I can't come through in the pecan Jag
Why did crack have to hit so hard
Even though it's almost over
Why niggas can't get no jobs
Why they come up wit the witness protection
Why they let the terminator win the election
Come on, pay attention
Why sell in the stores what you can sell in the streets
Why I say the hottest shit but we sellin' the least


Uh, yea, yo
Why Halle have to let a white man pop her to get a Oscar
Why Denzel have to be crooked before he took it
Why they didn't make the CL6 wit a clutch
And if you don't smoke why the hell you reachin' for my dutch
Why rap, cause I need air time
Why be on the curb wit a ""why lie I need a beer"" sign
Why all the young niggas is dyin'
Cause they moms at work, they pops is gone, they livin' wit iron
Why they ain't give us a cure for aids
Why my diesel have fiends in the spot on the floor for days
Why you screamin' like it's slug, it's only the hawk
Why my buzz in L.A. ain't like it is in New York
Why you forcin' you to be hard
Why ain't you a thug by choice
Why the whole world love my voice
Why try to tell 'em that it's the flow son

Times Up (’93 Shit),The Champ Is Here,2004.0,"I’m the nigga with the perpetual oyster bars
 pearl delivery, voice of god
And it’s hard just being a boss B
And I can’t go to jail cause them years’ll cost me
Don’t get me wrong, lay a nigga down if he force me
I’d rather just sit back and roll the dutch
Think about how I’ma put the game in a cobra clutch
Think about how I’ma get the caine over customs
Never underestimate niggas or over trust them
Yeah them M’s is right in my face
I just gotta throw my Timbs on and tighten my lace
If it don’t jam the Tec will stray
When I spit everybody gotta split like pepper spray
Cause I’m a nigga that hate to settle
And I’m a man of the lord but I still can’t shake the devil
Moved away and still can’t escape the ghetto

It’s plain to see niggas can’t change me
I’ma be a nigga for life
I could’ve went all commercial on niggas
But I kept it in the hood
D-Block motherfucker that’s right

I know how to get my peers off me
Make ‘em cry or die from high blood pressure
‘Cause tears insult me
 if you bobbing your head
You know that he’s sick
You know the flow is ridic’
Now throw him a grip
Y’all get it? You already know
I’m throwing them bricks
Putting purple everywhere daddy
I’m throwing ‘em knicks
That’s right homie you can’t move me
I ain’t going nowhere
I’m in the hood like bootleg movies
All you shoot is the breeze, a bootleg Uzi
I’m just waiting on a Q like Suzie
Don’t lose me
These penitentiary chances that I take
Should be able to get the mansion by the lake
But I invest my bread into something else
And there’s something else
That’ll make something melt
You just gotta feel the kid
If not rap? For the face of how real he is

The countdown to armageddon
You done did it now
I’m on a all time high
Ain’t a glass of milk out
That could bring it down
Pay attention now
Make ‘em squint when I spit
Like “You heard that shit?”
That nigga Lou zany
I ain’t the trainee I’m a general nigga
I could break the streets down
To a minimal nigga
Kill you quicker, you don’t wanna bleed

Nice pair of sweats and a ponytail just give me the chills

And she know how I like my pancakes
Off white three piece with the tan snakes
Eighty large make her ring finger stand straight
Now I could have a good time wit her
Chill wit me in the spot used to grind wit her
That's on everything I kill for her
Say what you want that's just how I feel for her

I gotta play it cool, mosaic tiles at the bottom of the pool

Bitches lean a certain kind of way when they walk
Nahh! Uh, yeah, ah-yo
I got a wet haze, coke, and a p-blow block
But y'all still missin the point like a free throw shot
Get it? This ain't some'n you learn, this is some and you earn
Turn it up and give me somethin' to burn
That boy 'Kiss is a hell of a man
Treat your life like a cell phone, so try to get a helluva plan
'Cause most dudes left the hood broke
A couple knew what they was doin, so they came back like good coke
Down South they'll tell you 'Kiss is good folk (that's right)
Up North I hit my niggas off with good smoke
Out West they ridin with me, now I'm back hard
I'm just worried bout the rats that's in my back yard
Hated by many, confronted by none
I trust two guys, one's God, and one is my gun
Jada is the nice guy, 'Kiss is the monster
D-Block and Double are is my sponsor

Cowards don't mean what they say when they talk
Cowards lean a certain kind of way when they walk
Cowards don't mean what they say when they talk
Cowards lean a certain kind of way when they walk
Fuckin' cowards!
Niggas can't be fuckin' serious, y'all niggas pussy
Niggas pussy - y'all don't like it? BRING IT, BITCH!
Just a lil' somethin' man, to let y'all know
To niggas know man, matter of fact
Matter of fact y'all niggas, excuse my back man!
Straight up y'all niggas, pardon my back!

Five time motherfuckin' champ!

By my side - main,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Right by my side
B. Hudson, Jadakiss, Ne-Yo
I think it's me and you tonight ma, let's go
They say every good woman needs a thug
They say every good woman needs a thug
Go baby, you so wavy
And I ain't never felt this way 'bout no lady
Considering going half with you on your baby
Something about you, making me go crazy
Know if I ain't soured up, I'm so hazy
Me and you on the same page, so amazing
Need your love girl, so many ways
And we could only hold out for so many days
And got enough points to score but you shaving
Hell yeah, I'm anxious, but you craving
Time keep flying, I'ma keep trying
And bottom line, I need your L-O-V-I-N
Come on!
Girl, make no mistake, right by my side
Little mama that's your place, keep holding me down
And you can help me spend this cake, right by my side
Ride with me, all I need is you right by my side
Such a small fella to recognize the Mason Martin Margielas
What could I tell her?
Man, I swear you gotta see her to believe her
Then maybe you could understand why I need her
Besides her being a diva she wasn't bothered by the chiba
Zodiac sign was a Libra, definitely a keeper
I just wanna put her in the sleeper, then fall out underneath her
Wake up, take a shower, then get deeper
Juice up, get some power and then freak her
After the feedback, then I could G Mack
But it's something about her love making me need that
Come on!
Girl, make no mistake, right by my side
Little mama that's your place, keep holding me down
And you can help me spend this cake, right by my side
Ride with me, all I need is you right by my side
When the drama comes my way
Long as I got you, girl it's nothing
Baby, it's nothing, I'm good
When these streets, girl, come what may
Shorty, we do what we do, so it's nothing
Baby girl, your love is something I need
Yo, they say every good woman needs a thug
I totally agree, that's why I need your love
And I can't help it if I'm selfish
'Cause I need your love and nobody else's
I'm starting to taste it, pardon the bracelet
The chance of a lifetime and I can't waste it
If being beautiful was a test, she'd have aced it
Her skin is flawless, her hair is waist length
Hi I'm Jason and ma I'm patiently
Waiting for us to have relations
Kissing me is just history in the making
Squeezing and hugging, I need your loving
Come on!
Girl, make no mistake, right by my side
Little mama that's your place, keep holding me down
And you can help me spend this cake, right by my side
Ride with me, all I need is you right by my side

Zero tolerance for that fake shit
Get shot playing, that's how we on it
Yeah its rap til we start spraying
When you see the nozzle on that k
You should start praying

I dont wanna waste time talking to fella's
Who run up on me talking that bullshit
Instead I let them talk when my goons get hellish
The ony way they talk is with a full clip
You gon make them boys dump
You gon make them boys slump

Leave you and your man slump
You gon make them boys dump
Show them with the right one
You gon make them boys dump
It's like that for real

Here shorty wild, tre pounds, 40 cals
At the dice game, brand new hundreds, 40 thou'
Stay fly, work out, all we eat is halal
You'll never catch em dirty cause all they keep is a smile
When they caught em with a gat in the car, you beat it in trial
You don't say too much, never eager to style
Remind me of Gotti, yeah, shine with the shotty
Lawyer so good, paid a fine for the body
Heroin and B-more, crib by the seashore
Car service to the G4 (?) valour
Piff rolled in the dutch or the cuban cigar
Trying to expand the brand so he could see more
Everybody love em from the cribs to the beat dogs
Leave niggas for dead, let em have a bleed off
44 to the head, will tear a nigga meat off
Won't show any emotions when he let the heat off


Yeah yeah, my nick name change
Call me tre when I'm snubbin' them
Billy when I clubbin' them
Bop when I'm cuttin them
Niggas dying, I ain't cryin' I don't even fuck with them
Card game shuffle, hundred grand in the duffle
Black jack, poker, p knuckle, you win, fuck you
Niggas try and line me say I'm grimey
Four hundred mill and I still can't chill
Call me G double barrel N doom, boom
I do it like a natty nigga do
Wassup, New York city's pharoah
Potato on a barrell
Shell case muffle
Make me come touch you
I finger fuck my firearm, we intimate, Im into it

Hit em in the head with the dummies than you good
Funeral homes make the most money in the hood
Either using the chrome, pearl handles or the wood
Animals trying to get away with whatever they could
It's spooky how you could get rich off Loosies
Four stacks for the jacket, sneaks cost a deucey
You see the five stars I'm a general salute me
They want a nigga to disappear, they tryna poof me
I'm just in the crib countin gwap
Up all night, I got a new crew, DOS, dump on sight
I be in and out of the country I jump off flights
Four fifth is room temperature, the pumps on ice
Handle shit accordingly whenever itt comes to you
Do the right thing or the get the right thing done to you
Whatever you do I just hope you got a gun with you

Dear Christopher Frank White Wallace
Yeah it's your boy Kiss I just wanna holla
In your memory I keep the Coogi in my closet
Kangol on the rack, a fresh pair of Wallies
You know I'm still the liquor and the weed child
And still got Branson on speed dial
And everybody's the king now
You ain't gotta be nice gettin shot is the thing now
Mafia was doin there best they seperated
Now Roc and Gutta doin a stretch, uh, yeah
Kim is still in it to win it
I seen Money L awhile ago but I ain't heard from Cease in a minute
People in power is queer
I could go on for a year 'bout how it would be if you were still here
The game got cheaper, rappers is more commercially successful now
But the heart's alot weaker
You know me still got the flow that'll pop speakers
First option on offense the top feature
It's easy BIG all you need is a protool set
And I ain't touch the paper that I was supposed to yet
Everybody that's somebody show respect
Only a matter of time before they notice that
I'm an impecable lyricist
And with the right mechanics, I could take over be clear of this
They well aware of Kiss the light of the city
And I ain't on the label no more but I'm tighter with Diddy
I got my own plan handle mine like a grown man
Long as I know I'm nice, fuck it I'm my own fan
Remixed the joints you had
But, they could never ever duplicate your swag (Never)
Meanwhile I'm a keep it so on my lil' plans
And you might bump into a few of my lil' mans
Up there steppin with God
Down here Mister Cee in BK still reppin you hard
Tianna so pretty, CJ turned into a Lil' Biggie
Just a little lighter but so witty
On your born day, we get the highest
Groovy still the best with the garments, he keep me the flyest
Tonight, Patron is dead
Only right that I take a bottle of Bacardi Lim��o the head
And before I end it, I gotta say thanks
'Cause not only was your time well-spent, it was splendid (thanks)
...Miss you, my nigga
One Love (So we tried to hard to understand)

So we tried to hard to understand, why you had to go away
(That was my letter to B.I.G., nahmean?)
You were everything - you were everything
(I felt it was only right, I really smoked with them niggas)
 (Jadakiss)
So we'll just keep our heads to the sky (Drink wit 'em)
(Sat wit 'em, talked wit 'em)
'Cause we know we're gonna see you in the next lifetime (Real shit)
But it's never easy saying good-byyyyye
(See you when I get there, Biggie)
Saying - good-byyyyyyyyyyye (Love you)

So we tried to hard to understand, why you had to go away

This the celebration after the fight
You know what I mean, Green Land, DJ Drama
The Champ is here part three (it's an invasion)
The bar is open, everybody in the sweet
Let's go

Nicki got em ready to take half the year off
Rihanna got the bitches shaving half their hair off (Riri)
Niggas is so wack, I took half the year off
Roll up the bamboo, pass the smen off
Dope is intended, take awhile to wear off
Keep straight full by the mild and veer off
Solid gold chandeliers, the champ is here
Big cups and liquor, cans of beer
I rep' Y/o hard, right up to the square
And I can pull a town card, right up to the lear
Hopping out all rugged, LV on the luggage (louie)
D block chain, you think I'm playing for the nuggets (nah)
Nah, I'mma boss son - I ain't Ty Lawson
And even though I'm on, I still got them things off son
All black attire, rapping fire
In they raps, just try reenact the wire
Ain't yo' fault the kids think you wack, they by us (they by us)
And these young cats easily adapt the liars (easily)
It's written on a blackboard
Death is a trip that we all have to pack for
Ain't no coming back ya'll
Still can't fuck wit the god, it's a fact ya'll
Flow is like Asthma, the way that I attack ya'll
Take ya heart away then rob the Yay
Do you like Frank did Arty Clay
Bought cribs in April, buying cars in May
Bullet wounds tomorrow, knife scars today
Game look easy but it's hard to play
Many niggas got a career, it's hard to say
How many win, when high demand - it's hard to lay
You don't want em to know you scared, it's hard to pray
Yea, now they calling you gay - it's The Champ (Pt. 3)
You can call it a tray, off this to NY all the way to the A
Then take it from Miami all the way to the Bay, hey

I be getting all this money why u pocket watching chill mane

Verse 1 : me and my niggas ball hard like kobe do
Switch to the motherfucking lakers like lebron dude
We on you 
Badda boo ping pong poo
All my niggas is on juice
And no it ain't bishop
Ill put the chopper to ya throat and give u hiccups
Damn me and my niggas live up
Got a motherfucking 40 in the bag its not liquor nigga",https://genius.com/Jadakiss-real-pain-lyrics
Willis (Jadakiss Verse),UnKnown,UnKnown,"(Jadakiss)
Everybody hustle, everybody catch bodies
Be the same niggas that I see at every party
Talking bout they got the 4-5th under the ruggy
But he on the dance floor, he doing the ""Dougie""
Everybody got work, everybody plug me
Everybody lookin' fine nothing is lookin' ugly
Everybody's rattin', everybody's po-po
Everybody got a block but everybody broke though
That's just how the hood do
So do what you could do
All downs a bet, and everything is good too
Hits me with the war stories, everybody lyin'
If anybody violate everybody dyin'",https://genius.com/Jadakiss-willis-jadakiss-verse-lyrics
