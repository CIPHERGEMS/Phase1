Passin’ Me By,Bizarre Ride II the Pharcyde,1992.0,"Now in my younger days I used to sport a shag
When I went to school I carried lunch in a bag
With an apple for my teacher 'cause I knew I'd get a kiss
Always got mad when the class was dismissed
But when it was in session, I always had a question
I would raise my hand to make her stagger to my desk and
Help me with my problem, it was never much
Just a trick, to smell her scent and try to sneak a touch
Oh, how I wish I could hold her hand and give her a hug
She was married to the man, he was a thug
His name was Lee, he drove a Z
He'd pick her up from school promptly at 3 o' clock
I was on her jock, yes indeedy I wrote graffiti on the bus
First I'd write her name then carve a plus
With my name last, on the looking glass
I seen her yesterday but still I had to let her pass

She keeps on passing me by
She keeps on passing me by
(Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on passing me by
(Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on pa--

When I dream of fairytales I think of me and Shelly
See she's my type of hype and I can't stand when brothers tell me
That I should quit chasin' and look for something better
But the smile that she shows makes me a go-getter
I haven't gone as far as asking if I could get with her
I just play it by ear and hope she gets the picture
I'm shooting for her heart, got my finger on the trigger
She could be my broad and I could be her nigga
But, all I can do was stare
Back as kids we used to kiss when we played truth or dare
Now she's more sophisticated, highly edu-ma-cated
Not at all overrated,
 
I think I need a prayer
To get in her book
 
and it looks rather dry
I guess a twinkle in her eye is just a twinkle in her eye
Although she's crazy stepping, I'll try and stop her stride
'Cause I won't have no more of this passing me by

Time for me to voice my opinion can't be pretending she didn't have me
Sprung like a chicken,
 
chasing my tail like a doggie
She was kind of like a star, thinking I was like a fan
Damn, she looked good, downside: she had a man
He was a rooty-toot, a nincompoop
She told me soon your little birdie's gonna fly the coop
She was a flake like corn
 
and I was born not to understand
By letting her pass I had proved to be a better man

She keeps on passing me by
She keeps on passing me by
(Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on passing me by
(Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on passing me

Now there she goes again, the dopest Ethiopian
And now the world around me begins moving in slow motion when-
Ever she happens to walk by
 - 
why does the apple of my eye
Overlook and disregard my feelings no matter how much I try?
Wait, no, I did not really pursue my little princess with persistence
And I was so low-key that she was unaware of my existence
From a distance I desired her, secretly admired her
Wired her a letter to get her
And it went, 
""My dear, my dear, my dear, you do not know me but I know you
Very well now let me tell you about the feelings I have for you
When I try or make some sort of attempt, 
I symp
Damn I wish I wasn't such a wimp
'Cause then I would let you know that I love you so and if I was your man then I would be true
The only lying I would do is in the bed with you""
Then I signed ""Sincerely, the one who loves you dearly, PS Love Me Tender""
The letter came back three days later: Return to Sender, damn

She keeps on passing me by
She keeps on passing me by
(Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on passing me by
(Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on passing me by
(Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on pa--
(Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
Passing me by
(Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
(Nevertheless)
(Nevertheless)
(Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on passing me by
She keeps on passing me by

Can't keep running away
Can't keep running away
Can't keep running away

I must admit on some occasions
I went out like a punk and a chump
Or a sucka or something to that effect
Respect I used to never get
Cause all I got was upset
When niggas used to be like
(""What's up, fool?! Nigga, what's up?!"")
And tried to sweat a nigga like the Lip
For no reason at all I can recall niggas throwing Cs in my face
Down the hall I'm kickin' it in the back of the school eating chicken at three
Wondering, ""Why is everybody always pickin' on me?
I tried to talk and tell them, chill, I did nothin' to deserve this
But when it didn't work, I wasn't scared, just real nervous and unprepared
To deal with scrappin' no doubt
My pappy never told me how to knock a nigga out
But now in '95 I must survive as a man on my own
Fuck around with Fatlip, yes, ya get blown
I'm not tryin' to show no macho is shown
But when it's on, if it's on, then it's on

Can't keep running away
Can't keep running away
Can't keep running away
Can't keep running away

One, two... so listen here...
There comes a time in every man's life
When he's gotta handle shit up on his own
Can't depend on friends to help you in a squeeze
Please, they got problems of their own
Down for the count on seven chickenshits don't get to heaven
Til they faced these fears in these fear zones
Used to get jacked back up in high school, I played it cool
Just so some real shit won't get full blown bein' where I'm from
They let the smoke come quicker than an evil redneck
Could lynch a helpless colored figure and
As a victim I invented low-key
Till the keyhole itself got lower than me
So I stood up and let my free form form free
Said I'm gonna get some before they knockin' out me
I don't sweat it, I let the bullshit blow in the breeze
In other words, just debris

Can't keep running away
Can't keep running away
Can't keep running away
Can't keep running away

It's 1995
And now that I'm older, stress weighs on my shoulders
Heavy as boulders, but I told y'all
Until the day that I die I still
Will be a soldier and that's all I told ya
And that's all I showed ya
And that's all I sold ya
And all this calamity is rippin' my sanity
Can it be (that I'm a celebrity
Who's on the brink of insanity?)
Now don't be wishin' of switchin' any positions with me
Cause when you in my position, it ain't never easy
To do any type of maintainin'
Cause all this gamin' and famin' from entertainin'
Is hella strainin' (to the brain and)
But I can't keep runnin' I just gotta keep keen and cunnin'

Let me freak the funk, obsolete is the punk
That talks more junk than Sanford sells
I jet propel at a rate, that complicate their mental state
As I invade their Masquerade, they couldn't fade with a clipper blade
10 years in the trade is not enough, you can't cut it
I let you take a swing, and you bunted for an easy out
I leave emcees with doubt of exceeding
My name is Bootie Brown and I'm proceeding, leading
They try to follow but they're shallow and hollow
I can see right through them like an empty 40 
bottle of O.E
They have no key or no clue
To the game at all, now they washed up
Hung out to dry
Stand there looking stupid, wondering why
(why man?)
It was the fame, that they tried to get
Now they walking around talkin' about represent
And keep it real, but I got to appeal
'Cause they existing in a fantasy when holding the steel

Drop!

Rock-a-bye baby
Listen to your heartbeat pumping to a fine
Ravine of all things it's a vain of a shrine
All missions impossible are possible, 'cause I'm
Headed for a new sector 365
Days from now, I'll wipe the sweat from my eye
And each and every true will stick or fall from the skies
Of my cloud nine
From homies all the way to chicks, no matter how fine
Controlling is a swollen way to wreck a proud mind
You hold it in your hands and watch a man start crying
Tear after tear in the puppet man's hands
Every time you take a stance you do the puppet man's dance
And the world's at a standstill, deep in broken-man's-ville
Trapped in the moat with an anvil, still
Killing yourself, and dogging ya health
You ain't amphibious, so grab a hold of yourself

(Shit is-shit is ill)
But through my will, my flow still will spill
Toxic slick to shock sick like electrocute
When I execute acutely over the rhythm
On those that pollute, extra dosages is what I gotta give 'em
Got 'em mad and tremblin'
'Cause I been up in my lab assemblin'
Missiles to bomb the enemy
Because they envy me and the making of my mad currency
Currently I think we're in a state of an emergency
'Cause niggas done sold their souls, and now their souls is hollow
And I think they can't follow
They can't swallow the truth because it hurts
This is how I put it down, this is my Earth, my turf
The worth of my birth is a billion
And you know what time it is I'm gonna make a million
Yeah, you know what time is it?

Ya mom is so fat (how fat is she?)
Ya mama is so big and fat that she can get busy
With twenty-two burritos, but times are rough
I seen her in the back of Taco Bell with handcuffs
The sad fact (what?) ya mama smokes crack (what?)
She got a burning yearning and there's no turning back
Her knuckles drag down to the ground when she walk
Spit comes out that bitch mouth when she talk

Naked on a mountain top, tootin on a flizoot
Ridin on a horse drinking whisky out a bizoot
She's got the wings and teeth of an african bat

Ya mama look like she's been in the dryer with some rocks
With the big bust nose sucking dirt out of socks
Held up the ice cream truck with a slingshot
She grabbed a bag of Cheese Corn and a soda pop
Ya mama root'n'toot and stole my loot and my suit
She may have the muscles, but no, she's not cute
She's not pretty, oh what a pity, got the glass titty
Filled up with Kool-aid, just for the kiddies

On a cliff butt naked, tootin on a flute
Ridin on a horse drinkin whisky out a boot
She's got the teeth and the wings of an African bat

Watch out, I'm thinkin about your mother to a funky beat
I went to your house, and she licked me on the cheek
I said excuse me lady, but I remember seeing you at the Palladium
Way back in September
Cause you was beatboxin for Lou Rawls
In some bright red boxer drawers
You said ya moms was pretty and young
But she's old as dirt and got hair on her tongue
:
Ya moms, ya moms, she uses Brut
Ridin on a horse drinkin whisky out a boot
She's got the wings and teeth of an african bat

Awwwwwwww, ya mom is so fat (how fat is she?)
We rode up on her back to get some burgers from Wendy's
And her skates went flat; I got stuck in her butt crack
They thought I was lost but I was caught by the G-strap
Heaven forbid a giant fart would give way
Cause that would blow me round the world in a day
We drove into the drive-in and she didn't have to pay
Because we dressed her up to look just like a Chevrolet

Ya mama jacked the Kool-aid man for a sip, nigga
Ya mama was walking down on Sunset with a 99 cent sign on her back

Oh Shit,Bizarre Ride II the Pharcyde,1992.0,"Little Sally Walker, sittin' in a saucer
Oh, how I tossed that ass up
Like a mission in the woods, woody woodpecker would if he could
But I didn't want to pass it up
To the next man had my walkman bumpin' on
The fifty yard line and my adrenaline pumpin'
Like a killer thriller driller tiller out with the miller brew
Filler up, took it 'til the damn Dutch puked
Luke Skywalker ain't a sweettalker so I got ill
With my lightsaber that came in one fancy flavor
My strange behavior led to an outburst
The night felt good but the day got worse
I thought I was alone, slim Tre the stowaway
With a brown-eyed bombshell that was dope enough to pay
I looked over my shoulder and my cover was peeled
By my whole school sayin ""ooh"" and I'm busted for real
(He came and went at the same time)

Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit

What to say the least
I'm so slick that they need to call me grease
Cuz I slips and I slides when I rides on the beast
Imani and your mom sittin in a tree
K-i-s-s (i-n-g)
Yo, first comes the tongue
And then come the she my homey's m-o-m what (m-i-e)
Yo, and to think from day one in my eyes I show fear cuz
I stepped into his house his, Mom's grinnin ear to ear
Gigglin and winks for weeks
I would encounter from this female
She's sizin me up for the kill
Oh what the hell is what I said to myself so that I wouldn't worry
I'm sittin' on the couch and wish Greg would please hurry up
She offered me a cup of ripple broke out the titty
Squeezed her nipple, said, ""Suck it if you like but please don't bite it""
I had an urge to say fuck it but I knew I had to fight it
Before I could say alakazam par dick ma wah
I took this old bitch in a doggie style
Greg walked in the room that nigga cold had a fit
But all this numbskull could say was, ""Oh shit!""

Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh

One fine summertime Sunday evening
Crenshaw Boulevard was in full swing
Perfect example of how looks can be deceiving
Rolled up to what I thought was a pretty young thing
Rollin in a purple samurai Suzuki dookie braids was an aid to her sex appeal
Dude, she was dope, man, real dope on the real
Well anyway I went toot toot she said hey a beep beep
The next day rolled down to the beach, deuce deep
Me and my new Crenshaw cutie
Coolin' on the beach and now she's rubbin on my booty
Suck suck suckin' on my neck like Dracula
But it wasn't all that spectacular (why?)
Cuz everytime I tried to touch upon her tay-titty
She would be like ""Quit, B""
Bitch was frontin' but I didn't say nothin'
Then all of a sudden as if someone pushed the button
I got a funny feeling like something was real wrong
Looked at her shoes and her feets was real long
Then it hit me, oh please god no
Don't let this ho turn out to be a John Doe
He pulled a fast one on me, yo
I guess that's one of those things that make you go: shit!

Yeah, bam, bam, bam, heyya, whassup, yeah
We was like that you 
know
Yeah, and I bet you got laid back
Yeah, I'mma uh, I'm a just sit in here for a couple of hours
Man, don't sweat it, yo, we gonna catch some stuff, dude
Oh no, I'm kinda tired
Nah, we got a basket, we're gonna fill this basket before we go, yo
Aight, bro
'Cause the otha fish is better...

It took a second to register up in my branium
My dome, my head, my skull, my cranium
My eyes have had enough, it was time to do some talking
I had to creep through the hound-dogs that were stalking
This slimmy caught me peeping
This means she wasn't sleeping on who I was
So she crept in like a hawk
In a minute's time, we adjourned to the floor
Ooh! I hit a high note 'cause of the way that she was walking
We got into the groove, I didn't bust no, uh, hip-hop moves
I just kept it nice and smooth
Next thing you know, we got together, word, I thought we'd be forever
Didn't have an umbrella, now I'm soaked in stormy weather
Whether two birds of a feather fly or fall it'll be together
Never simp, pimp, and leave your love life limp
There'll be no suicide attempts for this slim-trim kid
'Cause you know there's other fish in the sea, that is, in the sea
In the sea that is

In the sea
You know there's other fish, in the sea, that is
In the sea, sea, in the sea that is
You know there's other fish, in the sea, that is
In the sea, sea, in the sea that is
You know there's other fish, in the sea, that is
In the sea, sea, in the sea that is
You know there's other fish, in the sea, that is
You know there's other fish in the sea

I reminisce, try to clear up all the myths
For an imaginary kiss with you again
Not even friends, though I wish that I could mend
Like a tailor and be Olive Oyl's number one sailor
I ams what I am, still I falls like an anvil
She's heavy on the mind, sometimes it's more than I can handle
But men aren't supposed to tumble into the den, B
Macho
, but a honcho like Pancho will give in
Family oriented, but not Oriental
A dame is supposed to claim ya even if you drive a Pinto
A hero is a sandwich, and a Manwich is a meal
A marriage is a paper; are they fakin' or for real?
What's the deal, dabbers? Will you go tumbling after
Your man and take a stand or will you help him roll faster?
The reason why I ask you is because I'm sick of this
Bitch licking drip drip from a nigga's benefits
He doesn't even suit you and he's surely not your size
I'm surprised that you slept on a heart that's worldwide
And when ya open up your eyes, babe, my mate, I really wish
That you don't bruise a limb, as you swim with other fish in the sea
In the sea that is

In the sea
You know there's other fish, in the sea, that is
In the sea, sea, in the sea that is
You know there's other fish, in the sea, that is
In the sea, sea, in the sea that is
You know there's other fish, in the sea, that is
In the sea, sea, in the sea that is
You know there's other fish, in the sea, that is
You know there's other fish in the sea

Now, if there ain't no mountain high enough
Why ain't you climbing up?
My hand has been extended ever since the day I lent it to ya
I thought I knew ya, but I didn't even know ya
Bro, you're stupid, 'cause ya thought you captured Cupid
And you found that love ain't two bits of shit
So I resign and quit
It ain't even about the hips, or the lips or the tits or
Even the pussy whip,
 
Elizabeth, this is it
Because I slipped and I tripped into a shoe that didn't fit
And now the next man is stealing my heart away
I'd charge him like a bull, but his pull never fades me
The kid is going crazy, they stepping with my lady
They're working on a baby, I'm pushing up the daisies, but
Hey diddle diddle, I won't play second fiddle
To no man and stand firm on this
And seal up on the bliss with a big juicy kiss
Just call me Big Gibraltar, miss
No, I won't diss, I'm just like off to other fish in the sea

In the sea, baby

She Said,Labcabincalifornia,1995.0,"I guess everybody needs somebody to love
You can't leave love lonely
Cause being naive to it you can just lose it like that
See kisses for bruises don't make it heal back
It be's the sex appeal that's from the next and not necessarily the sex and
One might appeal to the intellect having a greater affect on how they feelin'
Stimulation breaking down their shields for the real and
As it stands mysteriously curiosity it kills the cat and
Offsets them mentally so they're trapped in behind
These fantasies with no action searching for a remedy
Now she loves her man but there is just a different type of chemistry
That flairs when her desires on fire
Quick is the fuse, another loves for hire

And she said...
It'll be good if you stayed with me tonight
So I granted her wish
And she said...
It'll be good if you stayed with me tonight
So I granted her wish

I was high like the vocal tone of my nigga Bootie Brown
Decided to take a ride to see what's really going down
Up on the North side of town
Of course I bought a quarter pound
Of bomb hemp, feeling alright like Johnny Kemp
On a Friday night
Looking right cause my shit is tight
Blazing blunts to city lights on Sunset and Crescent Heights
Bounce to the House of Blues then I slid in free
With tennis shoes, sweatshirt, jeans, and no ID
Soon as I step inside the plizace I recognize the fizace
Of an epp with an iz-ass more amazing than grace
So I waste no time to kick my line
I say, ""How ya doing?"" She say, ""I'm doin' fine""
So I commence to macking to baby to see what's cracking
So maybe I get her back at the cabin and start attacking
Threw back a shot of yack and started jabbering
Jibbing, fibbin, and ad libbing just to get her to my crib then
We was chilling on the bed, bumping some Isley
Thought I was about to spread the thighs but she surprised me
When she said, ""Oh like that? You know I don't get down.""
I know my homies gonna clown cause I let her stick around when—

And she said...
It'll be good if you stayed with me tonight
So I granted her wish
And she said...
It'll be good if you stayed with me tonight
So I granted her wish

Now Daddy's home
But she's been waitin all night so we could be all alone
This is an everyday thing so we hang out by the phone
Trying to build something real, working fingertips to the bone
So much love's gone astray that it won't be coming home
No time soon
So I dance with the silhouette beneath the moon
And she said, if satisfaction's guaranteed
Nothing else could come between the flight of a new love baby
Maybe we could be cool
Instead of sharing this here ship with the fools
You know that, right now, right now, right now, baby
Right now, right now, right now, baby
And she said
I'll give you the world if you want it
I'll give you the world if you need it baby
And she said
You know that she said
And she said

Fix it up eat it down throw it in the gutter
(Gutter dreamed it) sour, (creamed it) gotta
Skinny-dipped into her ass as if it was a pool of water
Now the water's gettin hotter so I bought her a new ring
Maybe a love ballad is the song I sing
I gotta kiss her ass my tongue I hold before I curse
If you really want me BITCH, take me for better or for worse
*phone rings*
I mean nah, just
*phone rings*

Well this is the final chapter 
Of me, we're going to rack up 
In tune, in tune, in tune, a button 
A button, a button! Oh c'mon, honey 
Would you come along with me down 
The lane and I will pick your brain 
I won't be good like you think I will 
I'll take a hammer and start to drill 
Your skull, and then I'll really start 
Picking, your brains cells, I will be 
Licking, mmm mmm mmm mmmm! *slurp*

Yes yes yes, you trusted me, now

DULL?? A little very exciting

BITING, and then I scraped the meat 
Off, the bone, of your leg 
Ahhahhh, you tried to make me beg 
But I had to insist, I had to insist
Iayaay, run up your pussy with my fist 
Okay, I think we've gone a little bit 
Overboard, don't stop it yet

Pack the Pipe,Bizarre Ride II the Pharcyde,1992.0,"[I dedicate this to buddah...this is our song dedicated to
Smokin' weed, 'cause we smoke lots of mad weed all the
Time...mad mad mad...so Tre, Tre since we smoke a lot of
Mad weed...you got what you want Copenhagen
Give the people buddah...indoe gentlemen...a lovely yell oh
That old boy...you must love the buddah...listen man your
Mother's (weed beat) is hip-hop...you gotta (scrosho
Bard)...man]

Trapped in the cockpit at forty thousand feet
The sky is the limit, but we supersede
The greed for the speed is like way beyond limits
I grab my parachute with like forks and spoons in it
And I'm falling, I'm falling, my heart rapid rushes
Death before my eyes, oh why did I trust this?
My reactions are repeated over and over and over
Oh it seems like I will never be sober
[Get up, pack it in...high...I love gettin' high...Im'a get high
'till I die...can I have a light my brother...where is my bud]

The pipe, the pipe
Let's pack the pipe
The pipe, the pipe
Let's pack the pipe
The pipe, the pipe
Let's pack the pipe
The pipe, the pipe
Let's pack the pipe

I look in every hip-hop magazine it seems
That the blunts are being passed around the scenes in teams
And the ganja man with contraband in lesser amounts
I guess 'cause understands he has his chance passes like Fouts
But his pass is incomplete 'cause I can tell in the smell
To let the dutchy pass me by, let the left catch hell
If I wanted to smoke tobacco I'd get a skinny white bitch
I know that Fatlip carries a pack to cure the nicotine itch
Because the only itch I have is for the indo or sens
So don't pass me that mess or try to even protest
That it's adding to the flavor 'cause the old one was fine
Won't you pack the pipe and keep it moving down the line


I got a big ol' blunt, I'm lampin' on my front porch
About to put a torch to it, then Coco said don't do it
Please don't hit that shit in front of my little four year old son
She sent him inside the house meanwhile my Sheri steadily rolled one
After the other, then another, 'cause I'm rollin' in the dough
So we rolling the indo as if the kid didn't know
He's lookin' through the window, yo why we tryin' to hide it?
To make a boy grow to be ignorant and misguided
About the bud!?
 Now I have to play the part of the adviser
Because the bud is just the tasty tantalizer
The bud not the beer 'cause the bud makes me wiser
(Figaro) So I said come're little man
And with his little hand, he grabbed the pipe
A lesson in buddah blessin', not too young, just right
So he started blazin', it was amazin'
My lungs are black and shriveled up like a raisin
But who am I to deny the kid a try
At nature's little way of sayin' hi?
So pack


Twisting turning burning
Rings of fire when I come into ya layer
Say ya pay yer fare for the fee
I see
The pipe, the pipe is what I like
I'm Imani and I'm hype give me the pipe tonight
I really wanna smoke it, I really want to smoke it
I choke it
The endo no jokin'
I'm doin' it like this
[I hope I do not get this by anybody
By anybody
By anybody
By anybody
What? uh huh uh huh
Well where's Quinton, Quinton, Quinton where are you?
Yo Quint, Quint come're who got a lighter?...Imani got a
Lighter...ah kick somethin' on the mike]

Why does your mother smoke pipe
With crack on the inside
She likes to take a bus ride with a sherm stick in her mouth
Preachin' about
What the world's goin' on
I don' know what's up
The bitch smokes
A lotta heron
Every day a hard
Basehead
I don't' know what to say

Let's pack the pipe
The pipe, the pipe
Let's pack the pipe
(x3)
Who packs the booty on the side (wipe)
I crack
I've lost track
It's a cheap fuckin' pipe
I saw ya...

Well, I am the nigga in charge over here
Sack the quarterback to make a cheerleader cheer
I fix my funk like Thelonious Monk
Stayin' true to the game 'cause I ain't no punk
Never been a bitch so I don't act bitchy
Smooth on the vinyl like Lionel Richie
And for creeps that's asleep you better ring the alarm clock
Don't dig what I'm kicking? You can suck on a warm cock
Originate trends, my rhymes they get paid
So I'm making ends and beginnings, see, I'm never afraid
Of a pancake MC 'cause I flips when I sways it
Housin' motherfuckers like a real estate agent
Douse you with my lyrical liquid for this hip-hop era
So I suggest you fetch an umbrella for my reign of terror

Resisted from persistence

Hour after my flow, she wasn't shocked with my swing
But a little too much weight to be a new jack man
Got more rhythm in my toe than a whole blues band
'Cause when I rock the people roll when I recite from my scroll
Play the beat nigga forever mind body and soul

To last me clear to the ends of my term
I hate worms, so I'mma bring in the fish
And induce my backhand to refrain from my fist
Yeah I wish that I change then I could shed all the mains
You trippin' on my ego but all my shit is sustained
Order order, I cross the border for a spot in the sun
I'm so down with myself, bitch I could chill as a bum (ho hum)
Drum, I'm so burnt that I'm beat
I got my fears on my nerves and the crowd on my feet
The only one who has my back is me, in reality, see
I'm constantly fighting heavy when we journey through the sea
Oui, oui monsieur, I'm true to the game, I believe my friends you slip me
I might have the ego but you'll tell me who're tripping
I know and it shows, I can look at your nose
And just tell that you're effected by the e-g-o

I woke up in the mornin' to a girl who's butt's soft
Gotta brush my teeth, clean my nuts off
Put on the gear that I'mma wear throughout my day
But before I take a shower I ain't ashamed to say
When I think of the night before, and the heat of passion
Your big brown booty, my mind starts flashin'
I'm lookin' in the mirror with my cock on rock
Should I pursue to do you or just stroke my knot
While my girl is asleep I'm caught in a jam
Went to the bathroom with cocoa-butter in my hand
Closed the door behind me, locked it very tight
Thinkin' of all the nasty things we did last night
Slipped out my underoos sat on the toilet bowl
And let the hand I hold the mike with take control
Closed my eyes tight so it would seem more real
I'm thinkin' about the crazy ways you made me feel
As my thoughts get deeper and a little more intense
If you don't know what comes next, well you're just too dense

On the downlow
On the downlow
On the downlow

He's chasin' me, scrapin' my knee on the cement is what I did
What dug, look under the rug and I got it
Hit him in the heart with my night -stalker slug, but know, this nigga had to go
Peep this, I was asleep, he climbed in my window
Grabbed me around the neck said scream and you're dead
I thought it was the devil cause his face was glowin' red
He was a brother but this brother had the devil in his eye
He was out to get I-m-a-n-i
First I took my trigger finger with a wiggle
The devil jumps into my eyes and then I giggle
In the back of my head you know Imani feels no shame
I've got my nine I said, with my millimeter go bang
I got him, he's crippled so he crawls across the floor
He's bleeding everywhere and now he's reachin' for the door
Bang bang bang, yep I got him again
His story's soundin' sad like the movie Ben
But um anyway I'm just protectin' my shit
Cause if it wasn't me he's killin' then my moms mighta got it
It's on the downlow
Don't tell nobody I killed him all right?

On the downlow
On the downlow
On the downlow
Cause you should know

Flip fly caught you soarin sky high
But a fly slip wash you up fly drip my
Eyes cry, tears fear
A baby eagle seagull shit falls quicker than a local hero
Zero from zero leaves nothin', now ain't that somethin'?
And all this time you been wantin' somethin' for nothin'
The crew has pushed your button cause your frame is on recall
The homeys kick the fact cause its wack to let you fall
(why doesn't what) you're rollin in the 'hood so niggas that don't wantcha
And you're fucked, crazy fucked, like the slut Heather Hunter
(with me) the one that punches shit, I know you'll get the pick
With the cars and the girls and the ego and the loot chief
I'll make this brief, I'd be lyin through my teeth
If I told you you was dope and your benefits was reaped
From my ego, those (libro) kids are creepin' with the steel
And you're cappin' 'bout this rappin' and they're cavin' in the grille

You got to tell the suckers what's up boy
Yeah ha-ha

I got a letter from the DMV
The other day
I opened and read it
It said they were suckers
They tried to tell me that my license was suspended
I got offended
For a minute then pretended
That I never even got the damn letter
It's nine o'clock
On the dot
So I think I'd better
Scoot off to school
Cause in class there's a test
I gotta dress fast
Grab my glasses and my vest
Oh damn
As hardheaded as I am
Hopped in my hooptie ride
Pumped up the jam
Put it in reverse
Into first
And disperse and
From that very moment on my day got worse

As I was standing in the street
I suddenly seen the smoke
I know that Derrick's on his way
I ran to get my coat
And a bag from the room
It took a minute, boom
Hopped into the car
We drove away in a zoom
I assume doom
As we were drivin' on the gravel
At any given minute we could have a shortened travel
So I ramble
About my life (is that's a) shambles
Should of took the bus
A bus without the silence or some old Nikes
I wish we had good bikes
We need to exercise
Maybe we could take a hike
An' you could give Sheri back those car keys
Because everywhere I walk I would not have to say please

Please
Don't pull me over Mr. officer
Don't pull me over Mr. officer please

Away
To our destination
No license no insurance
Not even registration
Tags on the plate say December '82
Car's so dirty it looks gray
But it's really blue
Who would
Think we're up to good
Four black niggas ridin' through the neighborhood
In hats and glasses
Makin' funny passes
Like drivin' slowly
Playin' low-key for asses
Knowin' damn well one-time will harass us
And all the while
We see girls jog
Sheri's little car is pourin' out smog
Then we made a right and I spotted one in tights (ooh)
(yo baby what's up, pull over)
(you live with your homeboys? Yeah I live with my
Homeboys, that's where you're takin' me to your house
Where your homeboys are? I mean but they're not

Lights, action
Without the camera
Si-reens and high beams
Two to a tee

Hot on the tail of an innocent being

I'm wishin' that the coppers would get off my ass

Y? (Be Like That),Labcabincalifornia,1995.0,"Be like that, it just be like that
Baby tell me why it's gotta be like that
(x4)

I wasn't sleepin I was creepin’, slidin', hidin'
I would like the girl behind me roll up a bad time thinkin'
Mentally sinkin’, presently brinkin’
Two decades and a half makin’ a path for mine to follow
The world is hollow, yet it's full of crap prepare to gamble
I give you a handful of chips and tips
For what's to come, I cried a ton of tears
Drunk a ton of beers, that's fun at first
But learned to persevere throughout the years
Kept my ears open, eyes scoping mouth locked
Don't rock the boat if you can't swim
Nobody may be there with the limb to lend
This is the end
, still I can't explain the fact
Why the fuck shit gotta be like that?


Know what, I said it
Hear me clearin' over so severe and dreaded
That they need to be beheaded
Why? I'm readily, steadily stimulating and mutilating
All sloppily copied imitations, cause they irritatin'
So I'm intimitading them over the snare
With simply a stare
Bringin them turbulent terror
And they know this ‘cause they can feel it
He knew that it was mine still the sucker tried to steal it
So I had to reveal it, through provin’
That I am astonishing and fly
And by just blinking my eye
In a flash I flush out the face, layin' low-key
Trained eyes locate to focus on the phony
Mister sometime-homey, why he act like that
I thought he had my back
I thought he had our backs
But it was him who I should've never trusted
And not at least till he got his attitude adjusted
Or mouth busted for acting all dusted, but bust this
Now when I'm out I seek and thought out the whole scene
For all sinister types, sneaks that scheme
They come into my face, I send them tightmen home
When they be suffering from the double-agent syndrome
Why it gotta be like that?


Sometimes this world means everything to me
The inside is lovely to these eyes I see
And sometimes in my mind all I wanna do is cry
Highly up-set but nothing drops from my eye
Those drain out my skin cause I'm pissed from within
I see a situation now and all I do is grin
People think I'm high but I'm mentally travelling
Aging is your times cause life's unraveling
While I'm straddlin' walls up this fuckin' mic
I hate to be a pilot crashin' in a flight
People need to know about this thing called life
Cause if you see the light then life's alright
So can you dig it?


I jumps inside the jeep as I embark on my dark mission
Popped in my freestyle tapes, started reminiscing
About my little homie, who was raised in Wyoming, wanted to be famous
So he came to Californey on the microphony
He was super bad and what not
But he was the kinda fella to follow fads that was hot
He became too fascinated with that gang related flavor
That he modificated, rearranged his behavior
He hooked up quick with the influential slang
Gangsta-stroll, cornrolls; the whole shabbang
Braggin' and boastin, boastin' and braggin
How he mostly be hangin' with baby gees I was baggin'
Like why you tryin' to ride up on the bandwagon
Hopin' they'd hit him in the head, but he steady saggin'
Like he a hog
Creepin' through the smog
Smokin' on some indo sippin' on a cup of O-Dog
Like most who come to this West Coast society
Try to be because they think it's fly to be a menace
So what a relic way to end this
Got rolled up when he was strolling
On a Sunday at the Venice
Some niggas never listen they gotta learn their lesson
The hard way I'm guessin' yessin'

With the rhymes, and the loops
Stomping out wack troops in my big black boots
Collecting respect and the loot
From the way I grab the microphone and execute
""Iaph's"" think I'm cute

(SAY WHAT?)
Yo man, I pay them no attention I stay deep into the cut
Cause I leave the tricks alone cause the name is not David
Copper-Filled pockets, never made it don't hate it
So let it be stated
Niggas 
couldn't fade it with an edit
And Xerox M.C.'s are pathetic
They tryin' to duplicate but they're comin' out synthetic
The name is Bootie Brown and phony M.C.'s forget it

I step toward the MIC grinnin'
The lyrical imperial award winnin'
Rhymes like a balloon that got a pin in it
Because my shit be poppin'
Like gin and juice I seduce these iahps to get loose when I'm droppin'
These rhymes on drums like my nigga Def Jef
My style is more unknown than what happens after death
I come fresh like your breath after your brush
Wack MC's like that orange soda get crushed

Well it's apparent, that many are so transparent
You can't believe ya eyes when ya staring
It's ghostly and mostly the wise who
Yeah, they just run this game before ya eyes to
To tell you lies in gold glitter
For many moons I've been a go getter
Took miles of manure from the purest bullshitters
Now them muthafuckas ain't wit us to get us
M-walk shake the cut through their neutro-transmitter

You must respect me cause I come directly from my internal
While my eternal infernos steadily towering
And over-powering, all sour-sounding
Wishing, wishy-washy competition
Definitely wack and lackin' any stable ammunition
Change ya mission, men and listen
My way of salutations get no validations
Just rejections and ejections outta my Hitachi

Come on and taste the real, step on inside
And confide in the feel I reside
By steel waters just a gear on the wheel
No fear on the steel just a

You gotta get on up off of that bullshit, stop fighting that feeling
You gotta get on up off of that bullshit, stop fighting that feeling
You gotta get on up off of that bullshit, stop fighting that feeling
You gotta get on up off of that bullshit, stop fighting that feeling

Let me entertain you
And interphase you, with the new sound
Sound is the side and the Phar is the cyde
And no matter who you are, you know you can't hide
Not from the eyes of the sun or the moon or the stars
No matter who you are (Da-na-na-na)
Come in, and commence to the sound of my drumming

You gotta get on up off of that bullshit, stop fighting that feeling
You gotta get on up off of that bullshit, stop fighting that feeling
You gotta get on up off of that bullshit, stop fighting that feeling
You gotta get on up off of that bullshit, stop fighting that feeling

Time to go all the way with it
Don't just sit there and stare or play with it
Cause we're committed to the seeds of the new breeds
The mothership of dreams where fiends breast feed
Step through reality into reality
So surreal you'll feel you never knew reality
Until it stood still now your far from a lie
When the truth tantalizes your eyes, see we already in the skies
Or outer space, standing here on the face of this earth
To the state to the grid of my turf
Where my mom gave birth
To all that she loves
Be it small to others, but yo, it's bigger than love
They did a cross examination of it
But you can't duplicate the state of our relations through translations
That's not the ticket
Breaking codes in Heiroglyphics
Trying to get down to the specifics

You gotta get on up off of that bullshit, stop fighting that feeling
You gotta get on up off of that bullshit, stop fighting that feeling
You gotta get on up off of that bullshit, stop fighting that feeling
You gotta get on up off of that bullshit, stop fighting that feeling

Yo, when money talks fools are always checkin'
Depositing their two cents
Foolishly convinced, blinded by their ignorance
That becomes a hinderance for them to rise
When they going to recognize, time waits for no man
When you going to stand and
Get up off of that bullshit, and stop fighting that feeling?

Now let me change the topic just a bit
Talk about the ips with the fat ass and tits
Comin' to the club, looking for a star
Ain't got ten dollars for a drink at the bar
Scoping around, looking for the best dressed
Smelling for the indo passing up the stress
Sniff sniff, yo, what does the ip smell?
A brother like Suave with a pocket that swell
Action was thrown, the ip was blown
Next thing you know, I had her at my home!
All alone, object to get paid
Only thing that happened was a ass got laid!
Now no ends and her ass was sprung
Used a little tongue, but believe I'm well hung
So lesson well learned for all you club hopping hoes
It ain't about the stardom and it ain't about the dough, so

You gotta get on up off of that bullshit, stop fighting that feeling
You gotta get on up off of that bullshit, stop fighting that feeling

Groupie Therapy,Labcabincalifornia,1995.0,"I was standing, one of the cast of many
I would give anything to swing hand in hand
With her but it was just a blur
I couldn't blame her, why give up fortune and the fame
For a nigga who can barely afford his name
So the dame kept aim at the stars
I'm often thinking about her
When I'm waitin on calls across the border
Made sure my rhymes in order cause
That moment could be near and it was
Now my attorney is tellin' me to sign here
So I appear and perform international
The time came she stepped to me I thought rational
But she knew I wanted it
She walked around and flaunted it like a peacock
I knocked the Reebok Now she jock
Blowin up the Pactel and the doorbell
Had to check myself as well love boat won't sail
Cause I'm no captain let them know from the start
I let you break me off but I won't let you
Break my heart

So I'm surrounded by bitches
Now this is the most incredible shit in Slim Kid history
So watch if you will the moment some good
Shit pops and they be foggin up ya grill
Overly thrilled to get you in ya ass like massingil
Still burnin shit now and I'm still learnin how not to fuck
With ya baby or make ya my old lady
You just overcasting ya ass is shady tryin to block
The sunlight with all of that hype and now I'm discontinue'n
All of this pipe that I've been layin as long as you keep
Swayin to anotha crew's tempo I gotta let you go and that's
Simple so get it through ya two temples because I'm
Tryin' to live fatter than a blimp ho
And you're exempt and I won't symp on a write off
So step out my world and turn the light off

She was my high school sweetheart down from start
When all I had was high hopes my health and my art
But when I got fame she became unsure
If I could still feel the same when I came off tour
I said ""for sure"" cuz what God gave us, girl, I'm grateful
No need to be insecure baby your nigga's faithful
So now I'm off doin' dates in a gang of states
And as my status elevates I see the baddest eights
At the backstage gate lookin' great straight
Waitin for a nigga so now I figure
""Hey I only live once I'm goin' all out today""
Made a call out to L.A. to say what had to say...
Now I get back the very next week only to learn
The tables turned like a technique twelve hundred
Last thing in the world that I wanted was my girl goin' out every
Night gettin blunted
And zooted with a clique of well known
Reputed groupie hoes from all the hip hop shows
Backstage with her little backpack tryin to get chose
By anotha nigga with talent wealth and fame
Oh I suppose I guess I got myself to blame
For turning her out into a hip hop freak
Now I seek counseling
From a therapist twice a week

So let me speak about the freak So let me speak about the
Freak
Instantly she made another selection
Because he was in the lime plus had
The money connection ""correction""
""way more paid"" is why she laid and played
A charade in the game of deception
This Miss-mysterious mistress is just an actress
Of the mattress cuz she's a wanna be mack-tress
Well built-but equipped with the tackiest of tactics
And I hate it why this is dedicated to all of them
Type of women who still be swimming Lost and confused
In the lake of illusion with no values is why they're
Constantly losin'",https://genius.com/The-pharcyde-groupie-therapy-lyrics
Devil Music,Labcabincalifornia,1995.0,"The way that momma raised us was pure faith
So diablo wouldn't faze us or daze us
Or lay us down to sleep
Know the wolf from the sheep
Or the sheep who cried wolf
And threw the deadly hoof
While the wolf was asleep
I keep my mind a ghost
Follow my heart the most
Don't play fools too close
Sleep with my eyes at post
So Diablo won't be hostin the game of life
The knife sits by throats of the young
And blows death straight through the lungs
As the mind gets washed by visions of sugar plums
But we shall overcome cause we ain't dumb
But we ain't smart, they got the girls by the hearts
And the niggas by the nuts
Ear, tongue and butts
Yeah, they're trying to fuck us up
But, shit, you know what's up
We gotta get with the movement
And move men soon
They consume every womb who bares
Beneath the stairs of their doom
Before they let a new soul bloom
Best believe they're gonna shove em in a tomb
Chorus: repeat 4X
Cause everytime I step to the microphone
I put my soul on 2 inch reels
That I don't even own

Early Saturday mornin I was cartoon gazin
Slowly broke into the kitchen
To fill a bowl with some Raisin Bran
As I ran up and down the TV stations
I witnessed Indian Joe
Getting tricked out of this nation
By a silly hillbilly
Who laughed as the shit happened
Everything's the same
The game continued into rappin
Deception is at an all-time high
You give a piece of your soul
To receive some crumbs from the pie
But you know I keep on rappin til the break of dawn
Even though it is my soul that I do not even own
Chorus: repeat 4X

I was po', black and broke
Beyond a shadow of a doubt
Ass-out, wide open waitin for my shit to come on out
Speakin about the time before I got signed
I was coolin behind Coolio in the County Line
My big brother used to say I was an asshole
Didn't graduate, couldn't handle the hassle
Of high school, why fool
Wit' foolish rules and guidelines
Fuck the cap and tassels
Said forget the trade and tried rhymes
Hooked up with J-Swift, got with 2-4-2
Me and my nigga L.A. Jay back at S.C.U
I grab the MIC one-time
Check it, 1-2, we in
Freakin' major flavors with my fellow Nubians

This one here goes out to my man Pooky (?)
This one goes out to the (?)
And all those who passed away (?)
And we go round and round
Life is just a moment in time (x4)

I recall being three when Sunny passed away
One of the greatest in my eyes till this very day
Too young to understand but understood the ways of good and evil
Life and death was in the breath of times fate
And God only knows what kept Peggy straight
Cuz in the very next year my Aunt Dorothy was the late
More beautiful than the word it was like killing a mocking bird
She was so young like the new year was all you heard
Almost saw it so clear the good times that we had
When my Momma showed me pictures life wasn't so bad
I got baby sat By Pat when Bedie was a small guy
And in our cousins eyes we were both small fries
Jazzywazzys growing up to be a big girl now
Father figure understands a man might like her profile
I let sink in a while and told let 'em like ya style
Both you and Ebony I be damned if this short life
Ain't heavenly peace and harmony family season and it goes...

Somethin that means somethin
Somethin that means somethin
I gotta kick somethin that means somethin

Wasn't a black prophet wasn't in it for the profit
Had a talk with Charlie Brown, he was like ""yo man get off it""
It's a business
The record companies are quick to end the fantasy
Your trapped in and he tapped into my frequency
Now I'm frequently going
Over such and such ends that such and such owes
It's later for the fly girls and hoes
Cause in this capitalistic society money is all
Fuck continuing college, I was too small to play ball
So I grabbed the MIC device never thought about it twice
If you think this is a game nigga you better think twice...

I gotta kick somethin that means somethin
Somethin
Somethin that means somethin
Somethin that means somethin

Time is just a faze and
Life is just a riddle like
If you build a twinkie there's
A man in the middle with a
Chick on the side that's along
For the fun so I see
Her as a stallion and I
Ride everyone, ban together
If your in the same level
Most of us are free based
On bring rebels fightin causes
Against the devil in the
Heart of round meadows either
Verbally or with these stilettos
Eyes cold as dark parks or
Steel metal the world is never
Settle cause it rotates like
Ho cakes under glass, it's all
About ya future yet it's all
About ya past like how many
Faces did ya mold in ya mask
Before your free at last
Eye ask, to be or not
People like ta see ya rot and die

I'm the ""F"" the ""A"" the ""T"" the ""L"" the ""I"" the ""P""
And everything I say be either fat or fly cuz
You best believe I put in time to conceive
Deep concentration from sunrise to eve
And even in my sleep sometimes
Rhymes formulate
Free form, lyrical storms falling
From a cloudy brain
In my dream like state
Then I awake
To make these silly saps collapse
As I dilapidate the wack
When it comes to rhymes I'm kind of like a mack
I got these flows strollin up and down the track
So the dough I stack up in piles and piles
For my lyrical creation
Travel miles and miles
To reach my destination
Been through so many trials
And many tribulations
But I do this shit, I do this shit, I do this shit
For the people of my nation

Hey You,Labcabincalifornia,1995.0,"Beam me-beam me-beam me up, Scotty
Not as to where I have no control of my body
Tweaking diodes I walk the roads like karate masters
Most the time my mind be ghost like Casper sinkin faster
But coming up in this shit sometimes I'm alienated, underrated
Suckas hate it that I made it as a misfit
But you know if the shoe fits I'mma wear it like a glass slipper
Hike to the big dipper, dip like a skipper, no top could be tipper (say what?)
But fools be tryin to rape friends to make friends
And that's one big twisted ass picture
Like Jack the Ripper
Caught up in the net like Flipper on a tuna protest, yeah, where's the focus
Got me fuckin with these friends and they crackin' my lens
And now, shit be'z foul as a mutha
Word to my sistas and my brothas and my color

""Hey you""
Can I take up a moment of your precious time
To realize and define the whole truth
""Hey you""
Yeah take up a moment and clarify this for you

Because of my high altitude, the attitude of this one dude
Was just so lewd that he was viewed as rude and pursued by the Cyde
He was booed and chewed like food in the feud
Ending a career way shorter than an interlude and dude
The word I heard is that your vision is blurred
That's why you be speakin' the word so absurd, but
You get exactly what you deserve
As I hit and you swerve to hit the curb
Cuz you be totally guilty of the filthy-type phrasing
Faltering for sure under pressure
Overhyped and unamazing


You know what time it is 1995, 1997, 1999
Nigga its all going, velocity in Chicago, you know what I'm sayin
This is another Lab Cabin production
Instructions are as follow
Don't try to follow
Nor swallow, nor bite
Nor nibble, what I write
You know what time this is, that shit ain't right
Yeah, uh, I gotta give a shoutout to my man M-Walk
You know what I'm sayin my man Schmooche Cat
You know what I'm sayin my legacy
My main man Tre, Fat Lip, Bootie Brown, Imani, Pharcyde
Forever, and it don't stop

Knew U,Humboldt Beginnings,UnKnown,"And I still, gotta ask
You could've told me

And I thought that I knew you
Better than that, better than that
Better than that, better than that

So, So, So
From the beginning it was known
Had a brother here, but now he's gone (real gone)
He's not six deep, find him on 6th Street
His mind now mincemeat, sleeping on concrete
Can tell when she went to sleep, she's still weak
About a big bro, overdid it one day
Decide to hit her, no booz, no drugs, no playaz
No thugs, no luv no hugs
When she caught me, found the stash in the coffee?
Call me from the payphone speaking real softly
That I've broken the seal of trust
On her way to her momma's house
On the bus, it was old for us, don't make a fuss
She said, as the tears shed, explained that she felt
Misled, she couldn't take the pain if I was jailed
Or found dead ...or from one upside the head
I tried to convince her, only happens to a few
How could I question, after all she'd been through
She said she felt bad, but there was nothin I could do
I thought I knew, I thought I knew
 - 2X

Yeah, me & my man's go back way before the music
I'd never thought that he would lose it and do that
All year he used to be in my house, but now I can't wait to
Smack the taste out of his mouth
They say that money is the root of all evil, but not having money
Is the root of all evil
, chilling, talking, walking with my people
Talking the walk about how shit goin' be, we gonna rock under
Any circumstances, when I'm on the microphone

To give thanx that I'm still existing
Still insisting
That my people open up their eyes up
And wise up so we all can rise up
WAY ABOVE the rim of the muck
But we can't if we're stuck
In I don't give a fuck
And lost in a daze Lost in a maze
Trapped in amazement
And hard as cement is the head
And that why soon everything'll be dead
And red is the color of the blood that's spilling
And hella amounts is the totals of the killing
I'm tellin' ya is the sky is falling
But all you're worried about is sky bailing
You're failing way outta control
And you ain't doing nothing but losing ya soul

I got no need for jewels cars and clothes
Need to slow my roll but can't grab control
It's unpredictable when we will go
I don't really know but it seems it's coming soon
The way that niggas actin we headed
For our doom but we assume that we immune
To death while niggas
Drippin sweat tryin to hold their breath
But aah! they slept while the time just crept
Now they tryin to awake but it ain't much left
Sometimes I think we blind either
No hope or faith my people can't wake up
We sleepin through the day
Think it's all great but to me it really ain't
When its time to face reality we turn to a drank
Or some dank then we can't think straight lets
Try to make a change for its gets too late cuz

Bumping my beat but they try to defeat, My cause, but I'm a

So I can't pause, But all these laws (All these laws)
Why, up is where I try to keep, But shit still gets deep (deep)
How deep?, Deeper than a 6ft grave
And it's about that time I be more than a slave

High above the plains but still remains equal
Livin on, no matter how fly there is no sequel
I am not a supreme being, freeing people
'Cause many minds are zombified, that's why they never rest
Fightin for the light and fightin' holes in their chest
Merely scavengers but no one who'll confess
But in time, they will all undress
Livin in the lost & found, trapped without sound
Dappin' ass a pound means it's way underground
No, calculating 'cause it's all round
Round like a figure, in old school calligra-phy
So figure that you don't wanna see
Far greater than the eye so you can fly Cali
Used to have a tax on teens now they got a tax on me
But that's if you can find me
I'll be trippin with the scene with the pan-de..monium

Or Sodom, I shoulda shot him but I didn't
Right then, to me my man hit it
Just because I'm tenant reason why they hit me with a rotten label
And use trickery to put my cards upon the table
So they can COPY, but they're UNABLE~!
They come SLOPPY, ill equipped to grip the sacred cables
Stretchin' out, that age old fable
How they're not really my friends
They can't wait to infiltrate and get me for my ends
It's been trend-in, in everything I do

Main reason why I, resist whack guys
And let 'em know they couldn't wrap with me aluminum

On a daily basis, to the point we embrace this
(What?) Demonic debauchery
Negatively affecting the psyche, that's why we like to see
Some type of monster chasin'
Erasin' people from the face of the Earth like Jason
When that was just a movie merely illustrating
The illy type of shit that they really got waitin'
And I can't be condonin' 'em (Why is that?)
Sick minds perpetuatin' pandemonium

On my terrain, they remain in the same frame of thought

To reconcile with the present, peasant
Meaning unsliced conditions
Like the ninjas on my trail, you will fail in hell
The young male will prevail when all hell breaks

We gotta hustle ya'll, we gotta hustle
We gotta hustle ya'll, we gotta hustle
We gotta hustle ya'll, we gotta hustle
...

Lookin to advance in this world that's monopolized so I utilize
Careful not to jeopardize on my chances
Some niggas pack 17 to stack their advances
I had a couple of homies that went to Kansas and Colorado
I never been one to follow
I'm a lone desperado on the come up who rather sum up
Siskel gets paid to sit down with his thumb up
Asshole, watch cash flow take a downfall when your shit not on the ball
Who you gonna call?
Hustle hustle hustle hustle

First you see a flash & then you smell smoke
Schmooche cat, controllin the whole scene
As my people choke, the hustle
I want to be down & all off into it
Like Russell Simmons, I like the women's
The hers not the him, Ipass L's to my bredren
In my pocket stacks ends
But I always find myself saying, please excuse me sir
Place down your
Bottle
I didn't mean to step upon your eypps throttle
And get her overheated ready to be treated
For the Schmooche Cat addiction affection
To her state and being I had her seeing triple visions
Blue mountain tops and purple valley
Wantin' to hang with her eypps in my alley

Some do it illegal, others just want more than their equal
Tryin not to get caught up in the evil This goes out to all my hustling people
Just do it, do it, do it
Do it, do it, do it
Just do it, do it, do it
Do it, do it, do it

Smokin doja in the south central streets keep me noid
Til I puff bomb E T just to fill the void and recollect the word
Of a Vet once put me down with Be about your paper mack and
Watch
The folks you clown with life's a hustle have money have heart
My matrimony to this playa shit is death do us part
And chasin papes from the nine six to infin
Blazin endo stems sippin yack and straight Hen
Gettin twisted out of shape like a pretzel Comin wit more cross
Over appeal
That Van Exel and I hope to God that I don't go to serve no
Cavi stressin to maintain self preservation up in Cali
My partners of mine are skyballin out of control
But I ain't feelin that part of the game so
Slow your roll and pump your brakes for goodness sakes
I spot the fake the scandalous dulo one-time popo & the jakes
Would love to ship my ass to Foledad or maybe Foesome
But I recognize a trick-a-ration so I mob by my lonesome
And see my status as a playa elevated as the hustler anthem
For all the haters is regulated

Some do it illegal, others just want more than their equal
Tryin not to get caught up in the evil This goes out to all my hustling people
Just do it, do it, do it
Do it, do it, do it
Just do it, do it, do it
Do it, do it, do it

You see back in the days crime pays
But now rhyme pays, so I had to hustle in many ways
Now let me break this down
I used to pack pipes like Wesley Snipes, and new jackin like
Nino Brown
Puttin suckas in fear
Lettin ya know Big Boy is the nigga in charge over here
I'm buying new shoes and new clothes
Give me one of them two of these aw fuck it
Nigga give me three of those
My homie Shaun Juan used to give me 5 for 1
Back in the days that's how my hustlin' shit was done
Then that game went astray fools droppin dime
Catchin time and brothas gettin blown away
So Suavecito my Negrito put me with the Pharcyde
Tours and pours of Hennessy by the barside
Makin papes makin tapes doin dates

Emerald Butterfly,Labcabincalifornia,1995.0,"(People singing)
Bah dah bha bha bha bha bha
Bha ba da da da bhum bha bha
(repeat 2X)
(Slim Kid Tre')
You see the moon has a way with young idle minds
And idle time is the playground
Where old professions lay down
Like sweet sugar stays brown and on the mind
Gals whose whispers blow through tender lips like wind chimes
They tingle quiet ears with seductive words that I lust
And enjoy, for you fly boys to look and not touch
It ain't much but bet your dollars
Cause they holler
Without saying a thang
And she ain't saying no names
And I'm fond of an intent
Rock hard and she was skin flint
Working on a flame
It seemed like every move she made was some good ass game
I had to keep my focus tame
Cause it's a doggone shame
To see them endless
And friendless
Will us when the pride feels great
Cognac watered down to its last tender state
And emerald butterfly disappears from the skies
It seems the moon can't fight the sunrise
CHORUS
Feeling high, on the emerald butterfly (repeat 4X)
(Slim Kid Tre')
I was the mack of all times blowing their minds
In a world of fantasies when I'm casting my line
They would bite the bait and I would keep my ship sailing
On my crusading others would be out wading
In the water (water), more enticing than the farmer's daughter
As the imagination makes you wetter than her order
Though sweated her 
so tough , so rough out here
See you can't jump into the picture unless you chose to lose an ear
More nocturnal than the night itself the mystery's clear
Smears of venom all up on your denim smooth as cashmere
Steer in thoughts of feather beds and lightheadedness
Abyss it gets deeper (you know) so be a light sleeper (sleeper)
The grief is like autumn rain (autumn) washing your needs away
Now all this gold is what I need to say about glitter...

Just Don’t Matter,Labcabincalifornia,1995.0,"Same as it ever was...

Don't you ever try to get with this
It just don't matter, ya still get dissed
Don't you ever try to get with this
It just don't matter, ya still get dissed
Don't you ever try to get with this
It just don't matter, ya still get dissed
Don't you ever try to get with this
It just don't matter, ya still get dissed

In times recent I haven't been content
Since my ears and years realized the abstraction of content;
Lyrical
All across the continent they took it and they filled it with   Some moralist material
Way back in the days it used to be varieties like cereal
And to bring it back I think it's gonna take a miracle, reason
We brung the fresh to get ya hung
So all tongues of gibberish, I wish they'd be done
Run, away far with no tussle
Cause it seems like all these guys are paralyzed
Up in the mental muscle
What they need to be is muzzled
Imani got the pieces, but I still feel puzzled
Phonies run out fast cause all the gas gets guzzled
But what time reveals is that he steals the rest
They're all stealing that will when they're under pressure
Dealing in stolen treasures for their personal pleasures
And that's wrong, you know that's not right
That's why every night I go in my room and I write
In the boom, in my room
Cause it's all good, G
And that's the way that everything should be

Don't you ever try to get with this
It just don't matter, ya still get dissed
Don't you ever try to get with this
It just don't matter, ya still get dissed
Don't you ever try to get with this
It just don't matter, ya still get dissed
Don't you ever try to get with this
It just don't matter, ya still get dissed

Many kingdoms rely on its people
That makes the balance equal so we all make moss
Serving common duties of the man on his block
Making ends meet the means into fiending at the park
Now black zeus stole crack, got beat with bumper jacks
And cats too laid back got jacked
Seeing a sister almost pass on my grandma's grass
Because the brother tried to stomp the fuckin juice out her ass
I never knew the real story
Grammar break bone
They going to wash away the sins in evil men
Gave up Pratt and a her pimp
Too much crime, the wretchest shit
And the places he'd been; I won't quit
Cause those who pose about the streets just lie in the pits
Where the shoe fits em, and yo
I can't get with them due to the fact that life is just
Somethin' they lack and they won't confess
They need a little somethin' like soul in their chest
And some love up in their shit, and they will be blessed
And ya don't stop, just some cultivation of the crops
And none of this shit is for the props
Straight from the top, so now don't ya miss
Cause all of you suckers will get dissed

Don't you ever try to get with this
It just don't matter, ya still get dissed
Don't you ever try to get with this
It just don't matter, ya still get dissed

To me you ain't nothing
Gone with my weed, the done deal
The best rapper in the world blowing right now, forreal
You call that shit skill?
Nigga, please suck my dick
In one hand I got a mic, in the other an open fist
What? You want to get wrapped up or smacked
Like a  Innocent victims of my show
But it ain't their rhymes punk, cause Buckwheat said so
I'm penetrating, escalating my devastation
Proves that I removes emcees like prayers to Satan
Rebuke
Cause you blowing up? It's a flook
I'm doper than that fool that you hide behind in your group
Loop the last two lines I just said
Play it over again ten times in your head
Weak link, like a midget in quicksand you sink
I out-think ya, see through your whole outfit
I'm irresistible, unmissable, Buckwheat's the shit
Like an elephant, bitch rapper don't forget it
Steppers like pulling blenders in gunfights, you with it
Rhyme riddler, making niggas hail me like Hitler
Insane, everybody do the Kurt Cobain, the greatest rapper

Trust,Plain Rap,2000,"Where ya at, where ya at? They keep asking where ya been
We been preparing for two thousand and beyond, Pharcyde
Yea yea

What's the gripe, clown, turn that hype down
You had your chance but wasn't able to advance
Now you're stuck in a trance
All caught up in our rhythmic avalanches
Biting our sound like sandwiches
You fucked up your chances
Due to certain circumstances that you could've controlled
But had no real substance so under pressure you fold
Freak the peak of this lick, sleek ghetto chic over fresh beats
Overexposed and cheats with verbal traction like cleats
Trying to get skeets, huh
Yup, they trying to get mine but I walk that fine line
Cause fools carry heat like sunshine
Damn! Pharcyde's popping, they hipping and they hopping
And it ain't no stopping, repeated shots to they noggin
Banging until they jaws is dropping, again

When it seems there's no one to trust
You can always count on Pharcyde to bust
We readjust, combust from dawn to dusk
Leave fly girlies with a crush, wack MC's on hush

Waiting around, it's like a hot day to burn it up
With another hot plate, got your neighbours irate
Volume way past 8, keep me booming in your system
From your residence to your auto, niggas envious
Green like an avocado, no beef, only equals cattle
Por favor, give you what you want and more, got you hunting
At the record store, first letters 'ph' as in phosphorous
Learn to enrich my mind, working on being prosperous
A fool with money is quick to part
Some things start off sweet and end up tart
I sneak in the funk like a  fart
When you was expectant it the crew and I connected
Keep it collective from first to last
Is it banging is the question that they ask


Impressed with the wrong impression
About this rap shit, it's more than my profession
It's heartfelt, this life dealt a deadly hand
Life's lessons, hard times made a deadly man
Out of the soft, stressing, I fall down to my knees
And count up all my blessings, push my wants aside for a minute
Cause greed had me testing my own faith
My own self-worth and how it goes to waste
All these things that I'm supposed to face
It gets scary on my planet sometimes
My intuition in the back of my mind
Tells me right from wrong
Giving me strength to write this song
I might not be here long
So I take it serious and stop chasing a dream
Cause it made me delirious

Keeping up with the Joneses, got your pockets leaner

Yo do it in the burbs with the female shakin'
Your head banging on walls, making collect calls
Like Tia and Melissa trying to keep in touch
The same homies used to hit up for lunch
Are the same ones leave ya' in the cool, in the crunch

Could it be that .. Don't be sure now
Could it be that .. You can't just struggle
Could it be that ... illusion

Damn so many brand new friends
But, when I didn't have no Benz
It was so new to frown and those who get down
You used to having everything sugar-coated
Though you hear the radio up
And take it with the arm and roast it
I Hate when niggas be trying to act all hard
When the cameras on
When the lights go off, they soft like
Lamps in the camera hair
Pharcyde gonna play the air and take you there
You know the routine, you know the episode
Take ya' cream, take your whole team to
A new city, gotta a new persona now

Every persons popularity and MTV
You're barely 26 minutes, a yacht in the sea
Hustling the streets, coming home at three
But what about a nigga locked up with no plea
Only seventeen rushed to emergency
Didn't make it he's a boy, he struggled for, he'll never see
I felt hella bad when his girl let off at me
There's mice upon your man, give it all to the G's and Feds
I'm a do away the work will be in advance
It was on consignment, so the city ya' fled
So much shit is wrong that you wish you was dead
On the escalator to heaven with the one night ticket
They say you got the blues like Wilson Pickett
You can't kick it, cause you're hot in every hood
Got hyped on the game, but you misunderstood
The lights and the shine, champagne, all the dimes
Caught up in the candle light, and infiltrate your mind
The cash and the clothes, fake fans, real foes
Wrong placed, wrong timed, well played, real close
Get the bullshit outta my face
Get the bullshit outta my face, huh
Get the bullshit outta my face
Get the bullshit outta my face
Ya, ya

But you ain't really takin' care of nothin'

Stop using all them smoke and mirrors
You need to focus
Hella, please, don't make me laugh ...

Known to stay true with the flow
And cruise on like a cruise ship

Living on the frontline (x2)

Who could believe in you if what you say isn't true
If he's deceiving me then what's he see for you
When they raise the flag who do I pledge allegiance to
Life in paper bags, sometimes they fall through
Best love I ever had was this world when it was new
Back in nineteen-seventy all the way to eighty-two
Things were heavenly around the town where I grew
Family love was the sound that I knew, or ran home to
Don't it make your brown eyes blue?
When somebody loves you just for you
With no competition testing you
What's the proposition of our disposition unable
You said that I'm a finish, my style won't replenish
You reckon I'll diminish, fuck a demolition
I'm steady on a mission with no intermission
Cramped up in rough conditions like a Cessna in a hurricane
I get my best nuts standing on virgin stages
Feeling timeless and ageless
Seen those like embryos in our invasion
It's universal, God is amazing

They mad cause my rhymes even sound fresh a capella
Hella fellas is hella jealous, had me feeling uncomfortable
Cause they're unacceptable while we're the exceptional
Here to let you know they're influenced by the phenomenal
While you're unable cause you're too unstable
All of your progress is minimal and that's the inescapable fact
Verbal rhyme visionaries equipped with stacks of wax
Rhythm that varies and carries like the wind
Travelling and elevating towards unattainable heights
Exercising my rights and just trying to do what I feel is right


There's a lot of players in the game
And they seem they can't remember why, forgot their goals
Lost then stole like skipper in the minnow
Now they got a long face like Leno
Stressed, feeling gray, nervous
Asking what they did to deserve this
Maybe it's not what you did but what you did not
You're like snot, uncomfortable, agitated
We inter raining what was said in the past
Nigga could buy a Benz and can't afford gas
Getting nowhere fast in a hurry
My visions not blurry, to quote Mr Flave:
Don't Believe the Hype unless his last name is Williams
Then it's guaranteed play, am I lying?
If you ask me how I'm doing, I'm trying
To stay above six feet outside of the bars and the concrete
Love pumping grass making a bomb beat
This is for my niggas on the late night creep
Watch where you sleep, watch where you sleep

Pain,Chapter One: Testing the Waters,2000,"No man is safe from (pain)

Broken arm, broken heart, shattered dreams
Tongue piercings lost at rates
Punched in the face by the local thug
Bent over, caught the stomach flu bug
While hitting it from the back burnt your knee on the rug
Last hug from the homie
Before he flies out to Pelican for the long stretch
Tattooed sketch takes two days to complete
Father never was around, deadbeat nigga
Tossed in the Hudson with concrete feet
Yoga master hypnotized known to defeat
And remain calm, blisters on the palm
Then only bring home half pay
Need a fix, locked up in the halfway
S&M freaks add a little when they do the nasty
When I die, pray that it's done in a fast way
Don't want no long stroll down pain's pathway
All life long playing the game in order to gain
Taking in the pain
Chorus

Well I guess you want to place your rays
Or have wild escapades, let your tongue
Cut the truth down like sling blades
Hard to rest your head on the mess that we made
Better let it go now while there's lessons to save
Every day's a close shave, cause I'm on
Somebody might take you to the grave
Cutting off your light of life, picture me a slave
Shit, shelters always cave and eventually
The inner trap's set me free from pain

To most pain is unappealing
But pain is what we're feeling
Needing healing, so much pressure is building
In the presence of pressure
We keep building until the ending
The love child runs wild
Through the concrete jungle
Trying to stay true to self and humble
Trying to make the money pile
Cats used to walk over me like a tile
But now it's them that's going down in a spiral
Cause they're trapped in denial
We keep ours as swift as the feet of Mercury
Or the arms of Hercules, yours is weak as an Achilles
The people feel these like a summer breeze
]From city to city, international
Multiracial faces in all places
The sun shines brightest on smiling faces
Today is that day when the pain erases
To most pain is unappealing
But pain is what we're feeling
Needing healing, so much pressure is building
In the presence of pressure
We keep building until the ending

I bet you got get-up-and-go power
It's time to grow, flower
Let the rain wash the pain from plains of indigo
Hard to tender when defending your name off pinnacles
Reclaim in intervals until you're strong again
Strong and sane with the stronger aim
My eyes dilate to see all the gain
And it's all the same, we're all to blame
For giving and receiving hate
You best believe in pain",https://genius.com/The-pharcyde-pain-lyrics

The way that momma raised us was pure faith
So Diablo wouldn't faze us or daze us
Or lay us down to sleep
Know the wolf from the sheep
Or the sheep who cried wolf
And threw the deadly hoof
While the wolf was asleep
I keep my mind a ghost
Follow my heart the most
Don't play fools too closely
Put my eyes at post
So Diablo won't be hostin' the game of life
The knife sits by throats of the young
And blows death straight through the lungs
As the mind gets washed by visions of sugar plums
But we shall overcome 'cause we ain't dumb
But we ain't smart, they got the girls by the hearts
And the niggas by the nuts
Ear, tongue and butts
Yeah, they're trying to fuck us up
But, shit, you know what's up
We gotta come with the movement and move men soon
They consume every womb who bares
Beneath the stairs of their doom
Before they let a new soul bloom
Best believe they're gonna shove 'em in a tomb

Every time I step to the microphone
I put my soul on 2-inch reels that I don't even own

By a silly hillbilly who laughed as the shit happened
Everything's the same, the game continued into rappin'
Deception is at an all-time high
Give a piece of your soul to receive some crumbs from the pie

Didn't graduate, couldn't handle the hassle

Well-seasoned like curry from India or Jamaica
Bring yuh gal to de show mi posse may tek her
Then cake her, how we're flipping thoughts skipping
Ready for the sabotage while the entourage

Resurrect em like they're holy, holding blessed communion
Redesign laws of union in a revolution
Connect the eyes to energize cause evil lurks in lies
Steals your breath and then you die, no one heard you cry
Now he's off to the next man's urging eye
Our excursion eliminates those folks that's purging
Like virgin we be conquering, reconstruct with surgery

On tight beats we lurk, to drive you berserk
Leaving suckers shook, what a skirt
Companies perfected how to jerk
Crews come together, put some love back in it

Cover your ears, your clothes, your eyes then look alive

And kick emcees in they teeth with steel cleats

Then you got attacked and attracted to this matter it's

Two majestic rap bands exploring foreign lands
With the mic in hand I cold took command
You here to destroy, we here to build and plan
Hella faded from the trees we bought, beware
Cause you can get caught by the all-out
Verbal assault, Pharcyde and Black Thought

Pharcyde make mad hits, see ya man through
Some lab test, grab vest while I commence
To execute with acute precision, cause collision
Got caught up in the head bobbing, neck jerking
And trying to get my polished shine networking
Merging, converging to split your melon
Have you screaming yelling, crew bail in

Venom when I spit it, backdraft when we lit it
Blow like chemical contents, I exercise this convent
Who done this cause we did this, booked and fingerprinted

Rub me down like lubriderm, we the cure and you're the germ
Embalm you with the fluid, make you do it like sherm

But, uh, excuse me sir, I begs your pardon
Can't you see how low the hole has gotten?
Apple's completely rotten with the worm in it
Dying, still we're relying on who?
In this case I face the grace
Of my unseen God
Even the taste of what's seemingly odd
Relieving what stress I manifested
From the weight of the world on my chest
Feeling restless, ready to hurt someone
But a hurt that size never eased the eyes
To no one, it's no fun
Selfless shades of living
Got to feel each day that's given

Now what the world needs is a love
That's sweeter than the melodies
That makes you go around and round and round

In too many situations I'm finding more complications
Than childirth but this my earth and I'm a
Conscious creature of creation
Here/hear with my imagination
Living for my son, dying for my son
Walking into the Sun, each one teach one
And it's love that completes the mission
And adds to everything that you thought was missing
Listen, you got to keep your mind, body and soul in check
In this land of no respect, where it's all about the cheque
I'm looking for a better day
Thinking that there's got to be a better way
Ask Tre, when I'm challenged
I use my talents to balance
And to rise like helium
Using love to find that happy medium
Forget that hostility
Cause with love there's always a possibility


Attempts at convincing me
To downplay another man's form of expression
That's not what I'm here to do
I fear it too but the future is now
And how can I make a song
That makes the world sing songs of love
And peace
When everyday's a fight with hate and the beast
On what seems like unfair grounds
Everybody I know is loading up rounds
For protection, well being and safety
Which is capitalised
Watching out for niggas fantasizing that they're 2Pac
With only two cents, way too tense
Looking to prove and convince
That they're big balling
But their neighbours was calling
Now they're hauling that ass out to Chino
Got a girl with the bambino on the way
Due like a library textbook
Writing letters, praying to God
That my son is not the next crook
Sent out to join Poppa
Wish life was like a soap opera
With the happy ending
But you know love is always recommending


Do we believe that we're civilized, sophisticated or advanced
So quick to draw blood if given a chance
We dance with the Devil and romance with his rage
With a curse on our mind our prayers seem vague
The plague that sweeps across the garden is fear
Scared of our questions for the days that come near
So we stand guard over our bag of fool's gold
Never bowing our heads for the souls that we sold
And it's cold for the heart that stays towards itself
And only feels love for the abundance of wealth
But you can't pay your way through the gates of paradise
And you can't camouflage your grief from God's eyes
But lucky for us the Creator sees clear
With visions of times when we shed few tears
When our smiles have stretched from ear to ear
All the steps that we've travelled from year to year
And he loves who we are deep down inside
Forgives all the hatred, the greed and the pride
It's the same kind of love that could keep us afloat
When we all realise we need the same boat
With our hands interlocked we could carry the Sun
And bring forth the light where the damage was done
So let's do the raindance and water the seeds
And pray that the harvest brings what we all need",https://genius.com/The-pharcyde-world-lyrics
Rush,Plain Rap,2000,"Rush, rush, rush, rush

What gets your adrenaline pumping?
Overtaking?
Mental thought process move diligently to attain
And acquire
That state of being all desires seen
Some get theirs nostril skiing!
The old men chasing nothing over nineteen
For some the rush is good but not the right thing
Too long or too fast, gonna spend it on cash
Brakes you mash, gotta make it dead

Rush, through my veins I can feel the blood gush
Gushing, adrenaline rushing, cause I'm rushing increased heart beating
Pulsating, no time for debating, you eightteen! rush
Like getting busted, butt-naked fucking, rushing to have sex. Rushing death, that's suicide
Pharcyde give you a rush like holding a gun on nitrous oxide!
Or like rolling (...) man, looking right into my eyes
How women feel when the tongue slides right up and down her thighs
Ever tried bungee jumping? I had a real surprise
Try flying high in the skies, then jumping out and parachuting
The way a man feels prior to an execution, rush
Eyes bulge, face flushed, scared of heights?
Try being stuck in an elevator freefalling (...)
Beware of the rush
Look out for the rush
Everybody's in a rush

Under pressure we hold it steady
Nothing will be delivered before it's ready
(Rush) If so? It's okay, later they'll pay
Rushing to do nothing, rushing trapped in traffic
Gridlocked, speeding up corners
Stay (...) but they cannot rush
Rushing to flush the rest of the evidence
A pure rush like turbulence
They wanna hurry me, and try to worry me
But they can't hurry me unless it's an emergency
And if it ain't, huh, then please stand by
Imani needs to take time to plan mine
But if I gotta do it on the fly I'll do it on the fly
But why, why? Rush, rush, rush, rush..

Smoking blunts, driving ninety racing on the Pasadena 110
First drop on the colossus, it settles in over shadows
Engraved in the eyes when a real MC battles
With his opponent
I use it as one component, linked to the drive to improve when the beat is dropped
I wanted the force to move, but the rush turns your brain to mush
Stimulation lush, with danger we brush
Sometimes it's the only thing sustaining us
It's the rush
Look out for the rush
Everybody's in a rush
Beware of the rush",https://genius.com/The-pharcyde-rush-lyrics
I Smoke,The Prof. in... Convexed ,UnKnown,"Lyrics to
I Smoke Feat. Bootie Brown
(Intro)
Yeah, check it out, one two one two
It's the br-b-b-b-b-browwnnnn
Yeah,It goes like this man, yo
(Verse 1)
By now, I probably already puff my weight
In the finest dosier you can locate
From Morocco to the back of Del Taco
To hook up with your man before you seize that day
I recall pinchin pops
Coco Tye
20 mins in
It’s Beddie By
Euphoric, Cruise control
Rollin' on dubs, Stinkin' up Clubs
Motor vehicles, 
temporary residence
Ashes left is the only evidence the blue suits find
Maaaannnnn
We blaze all the time
On the reg
I used to tape to my leg
Triple Ziploc
With the vacuum seal
Open the shit
It smells like a field of skunks secreting
I made some bad judgments took a beating
Canadians competing
With brothers from south of the border
Always in reach of a least a quarter
Of a P
I make it summer sault with a triple-back
Gone are the days of the nickel sack
Old school tokers can remember that
.9 for a dub
That shit is hella whack
Man but you know it all good
Cause I
(chorus)
I-I-I-I-I Smoke
Spent my last even if I'm broke
Lets piece on together so we can toke
Lets go, Lets gooo smoke!

(Verse 2)
I’m on a 747 doddie reeking
Blood shot eyes
I giggle while I’m speakin'
I used to donate a Lincoln
To the cause
So let’s us elevate
Chop it with the farmers
While I delegate
Tulip token
Only demonstrates
Quality control
Love to carry weight
Like muscle men at Venice
I’m a pothead not a menace
I’m a pothead let me finish
If the bowl is dust I replenish
With the condiment the connoisseur
Take a step beyond appreciation
Guilty by affiliation
Gather with my congregation
I know I speaking to a 1/5 of the nation
Those who ain’t tried and you burning with temptation
Beat banging in the studio what a sensation
It’s the shit after relation
Peace after altercation
I pothead in this X generation
I hired to respond to bring some
Clarification
(chorus)
(Verse 3)
I-I-I-I-I-I got some Bubble Berry
You got some Widow
Run to the store we can split down the middle
Add some hash
From where they bombin' Osama
We blaze and politic about the drama
For hot sec
It brings us together
We try to put it in perspect'
Not for everyone
You could suffer a side effect
Rapid heart beats
Cold sweats
A fear of going to sleep
With no waking up
I had all that shit
Happen when I was just a pup
Barking
Cause I took
To big of a hit
‘Til this day I still do that shit
How I love to smoke the crip the chron
I sip on java that straight from Juan
For the wake and bake
A slice of space cake
Begin the daybreak
Jump in full force
Make it shake
Til it crack
Day over
I roll up the whole sack
Create a hot track
That makes you dip back in the cut
The score
Northern Cali Pacific shore
Redwood protected
Sun shine basted
You know why when you taste it
Why I

Somethin’,Plain Rap,2000,"I sleep wit one eye open, that's my third, that's my word
Gave it one try hoping to fly the whole bird
Turbulence occurred
Cause shit was turbulent and terminal just like an illness
How to be real with myself to even feel this
In grip with my controls to wheel and deal this
Chinks upon my jugular vein
Tryin' to kill this immaculate state of harmony

He gave me the impression that he was making real strides
Thinkin' of real progression
But only spoke on worthless earthly possessions
Brainless, dealing with the strainless
Needin' a correction for this infection
A Brand Nubian direction that left me in true shock
Like when 2Pac got shot
The whammy
I drop my secrete scripts of the uncanny
Broadcastin' live and direct throughout the galaxy

See I don't think you value what you got
See look in your hands
I'm just tryin' to be I hate to spoil your plains
We from separate destinies and separate trails in the sand
Even when we walk together side by side, hand in hand
You need a ride? Hey, are (are) you going my way?
Now we can kick it for while don't know how long I'll stay
But the key is to love you for that day
Can't control what we found or what's around the way
(Chorus) 4X
And I... I don't know what it is... but
Somethin's got to give

Runnin' low on the resources
Heinie missions, future conditions
Don't look bright for the next generation
Temperature's rising
So are the prices
You strung out on the vices
$2 million dollar ad to entice us
We live to want sometimes forgetting what we need
Overwhelmed with greed
The creed is so misleadin'
The plan seems to work and we're right on time
Got us like crabs in a bucket, all tryin' to climb

We lookin' for those critical signs in these pivotal times
Where it is not time for at-ease
The mission is the collection of G's
So please understand
If you remain man, take a real stand like a man
And don't follow the masses caravan
But for you it could already be too late
Cause your lost (lost) and it ain't no stoppin'
And going out at all cost is your only option

As I remember relations unfold
Good ol' day stories are always told
He was optimistic
Everyone falls under ""search"" statistics
Callin' on the mystics, psychic vibes, to add some insight
Air sicken, mid-flight
No turning back, leave you fall prey
On the attack, a contact with the sack to ease the pain
Completely fall victim to a game
In debt to retain
Balance always ricochet to regain
(Chorus)
Oh I... I don't know what it is... but
Somethin's got to give

And I... I don't know what it is... but
Somethin's got to give round here...",https://genius.com/The-pharcyde-somethin-lyrics
Passin’ Me By - Hot Chip Rmx,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Now in my younger days I used to sport a shag
When I went to school I carried lunch in a bag
With an apple for my teacher cause I knew Id get a kiss
Always got mad when the class was dismissed
But when it was in session, I always had a question
I would raise my hand to make her stagger to my desk and
Help me with my problem, it was never much
Just a trick, to smell her scent and try to sneak a touch
Oh, how I wish I could hold her hand and give her a hug
She was married to the man, he was a thug
His name was lee, he drove a z
Head pick her up from school promptly at three o'clock
I was on her jock, yes indeedy I wrote graffiti on the bus
First Id write her name then carve a plus
With my name last, on the looking glass
I seen her yesterday but still I had to let her pass
She keeps on passing me by She keeps on passing
When I dream of fairy tales I think of me and shelly
See shes my type of hype and I can't stand when brothers tell me
That I should quit chasing and look for something better
But the smile that she shows makes me a go-getter
I haven't gone as far as asking if I could get with her
I just play it by ear and hope she gets the picture
I'm shooting for her heart, got my finger on the trigger
She could be my broad, and I could be her (nigga)
But, all I can do is stare
Back as kids we used to kiss when we played truth or dare
Now shes more sophisticated, highly edu-ma-cated
Not at all over-rated, I think I need a prayer
To get in her boots and it looks rather dry
I guess a twinkle in her eye is just a twinkle in her eye
Although shes crazy stepping, Ill try to stop her stride
Cause I won't have no more of this passing me by
And I must voice my opinion of not even pretending she didn't have me
Strung like a chicken, chase my tail like a doggie
She was kind of like a star, thinking I was like a fan
Dude, she looked good, down side, she had a man
He was a rooty-toot, a nincompoop
She told me soon your little birdies gonna fly the coop
She was a flake like corn, and I was born not to understand
By letting her pass I had proved to be a better man
She keeps on passing me by She keeps on passing
Now there she goes again, the dopest Ethiopian
And now the world around me be gets moving in slow motion
When-ever she happens to walk by, why does the apple of my eye
Overlook and disregard my feelings no matter how much I try?
Wait, no, I did not really pursue my little princess with persistance
And I was so low-key that she was unaware of my existance
From a distance I desired, secretly admired her
Wired her a letter to get her, and it went
My dear, my dear, my dear, you do not know me but I know you very well
Now let me tell you about the feelings I have for you
When I try, or make some sort of attempt, I symp
Damn I wish I wasn't such a wimp!
Cause then I would let you know that I love you so
And if I was your man then I would be true
The only lying I would do is in the bed with you
Then I signed sincerely the one who loves you dearly, PS love me tender
The letter came back three days later, return to sender
Damn!
She keeps on passing me by She keeps on passing",https://genius.com/The-pharcyde-passin-me-by-hot-chip-rmx-lyrics
Misery,Plain Rap,2000,"Uh, I know you
You used to ride up high on your green steed
Usually after they come down
Fools come back around
Sniffing out the weed
In dire need of just some
Simple conversation
For some inspiration
Well accustomed to being unwelcome
Exclamation, no comma
More drama from your common
Or regrets that keeps coming back like
Shadows at sunset
Some sweat while we move
They try to blackmail this black male
With weak stories and frail ass tales
Your worthless
Ruthless, movements won't do it
So don't do it
Your envy is hungry like the wolf and duran duran
And your plan is see through like seran
Dried in the Sudan
You need to come with a new plan
Your loneliness was the cause of all of this behold
It was no real reason for all that to be told
Your brain is twitching, stop bitching
Intertwining mine like stitchin'
You and your uncontrollable, gullible, emotional conditions

And misery (misery, misery, love)
Why you wanna take me there? (company) With you, with you
And misery (misery, misery, love)
Why you wanna take me there? (company) With you, with you

Claimin' to be a friend in need
Troubles interwoven like tweed suits
What's lower than soles on boots?
A partner, you told to get his shit together
Stayed in co-hoots
Aggravated, agitated, misery he scoots
Cumbersome, isolated, bad villains migrated
Tryin' to take me down under
Treat me like aborigines
Knock to ground like tees at the matches
Who realizes the turn disasters
Got me thinking negative
With things developing the bonk
And brings a whole new pitch
Changin' my frame of thought
Caught by the misery you brought
And always wanna bring
Love to cling like static
Start static
You exist to create a panic, sorrow, ruin the mood
Random craters destroy the good vibe
Words can't describe, portray
But I'm not down with your forte of disarray
You make my spirit decay
Cause my focus to stray

And misery (misery, misery love)
Why you wanna take me there? (company) With you, with you
And misery (misery, misery love)
Why you wanna take me there? (company) With you, with you

I ask myself this question: Is freedom what I really want?
Soaking in a boola pain
Dreaming what my love has been
For life
I recall being born again twice
Cause every time I reach for what ain't real
I fall on the knife and die
Or drown in my tears around the reasons why
We ain't achieving it
Instead of just believing in
God almighty, not the almighty dollar
Selling souls for bargain prices
Always make me holler
Smart enough to be a scholar
Dumbfounded on the dollar, though
One step for mankind
Makes a million miles of trying for
Once you live in luxury, a million things are dyin'
A million voices lying
Never add up to the truth
Ninety-eight percent of that makes me want the other two
To complete this love
Wishin' to help my condition
Every day, I'm wishin'
And every way, I'm hopin' and wishin'

And misery, (misery, misery ahh)
Why you wanna take me there? (company) With you with you
And misery (misery, misery, love)
Why you wanna take me there? (company) With you
And misery (misery, misery love)
Why you wanna take me there? (company) With you, with you
And misery (misery, misery love)
Why you wanna take there? (company) With you, with you",https://genius.com/The-pharcyde-misery-lyrics
My Agenda,Chapter One: Testing the Waters,2000,"Now she was fresh dressed like a million bucks
Stepped to the scene in my (????)
What she would manifest would self-destruct
Revealing legs beneath the dress and pushing up her breasts
Making it hard for other women to pass this test
See that, why we always fiending for flesh?
Fantasies, aromatherapies beneath these canopies
Seductive situations make me weak in the knees
Game harder than Gs, rapt like emcees
Act and direct drama like they're winning Emmys
More than Demi, they say it's something in me
But it's not and all women is just a disease
That's airborne, since they're torn from reality
Not trying to cut you down but it sounds to me
Like you're headed in directions where you're
Bound to see and bound to be, feel me?

Same shit but different day
About three million different ways
It's hard to love you and it's difficult to say
And how do you expect for me to let you come and stay
With that agenda?!

When I first seen you
Personality was a principality
I was thinking casualty, killing serving
Backbone curving, twisting
Knocking it out like Ali did with Liston
You claiming that you Christian
In church with a hangover that you got
]From a shindig that you just left
A couple of hours ago
I'll do everything in my power to show
That I'm Worthy like James
When he was in his prime
But since I scooped your scheme
I wanna roll back time
And pay attention to the sermon
It seems I'm never learning
I should have seen your eyes burning
With the bad intentions
Like the triple-k out lynching
Now I practice prevention
Like Smokey the Bear
Don't get twisted by the pretty toes
The long hair till the ass crack
I've seen bitches run over niggas like a halfback
Getting laughed at, yo I can't have that


I ain't fooled by the appearance
You still get no clearance
Cause it's clear it's ignorance
You get no certificates
Cause you tampered with the sacred
And angered the energies of the ancients
And you can't escape it then
All emotions went vacant and then
Love vanished so you must be banished
And banned forever, from entry
Bust as soon as we, meet eyes I remember thee
Sensations, then the temperature of the temptations
Begin to exceed at the speed of speed
Racing through my bloodstream
Fucked up as a drug scene
Sometimes my measures may seem extreme
When I'm balancing in between
The problems and the pleasures


La la la la (and whistling to fade)",https://genius.com/The-pharcyde-my-agenda-lyrics
Freaky,Chapter One: Testing the Waters,2000,"I wanna do the nasty
Massage me in my body, don't pass me
You be thinking that I'm tripping like I'm on LSD
But I want you all over my body like LSG
Cause it's known, you be hitting all my erogenous zones
With full knowledge of the pleasure principles
I'm making advances, undressing this sexual enchantress
Been lusting after this luscious, voluptuous mistress
The best sex is when it's just about sex
And it's triple-x and it's got the sound effects
Loud as LAX, knowing exactly what to expect
Respectful, reckless passion
My hot lust is scandalous with secret plans to bust
Leaving you speechless, I love it
Fucking like I'm fresh out of 9500 (hella blunted)

It only happens when you least expect
Never dreamed this could happen
Only seen it onscreen

No matter how hard I try just can't forget
And I know you feel the same
Enflamed like candles in a monastery
I melt at the mere thought, when we fought
To get our clothes off, in a lustful rage
To wait another minute I just can't
I wanna taste your sweat
Sweet breath pant on my shoulder
Ice makes it colder, honey makes it tasty
Hours ahead of us, no need to act hasty
We take our time, whispering terms of passion
I know your spot and I'm asking except to continue
Healthy imagination helps us try things brand new
Incense burning, curtains open, city breathing
Educate the onlookers at the gaze
Pay them no attention, dizzy from the praise
Look into each other with the eyes ablaze
Burning with desire
We freak it on the bed, on the wall, by the fire


I thought of all the possibilities in my facilities
I heard the best situations roll in fives and threes
And my eyes received the message faster than FedEx
Read tantric texts trying to master the sex
And all its effects and what that projects
On one's true limit, like those too timid
They pose and then expose when they hid for a minute
Come to find that it was something that they did for a minute
I always rushed but never waited
Pleasant rubs anticipated
So I move in closer and brush between it
As if Mars were close to Venus, nothing can intervene us
Lust saturated every thought I ever dreamed
The temple of our motion made emotions kinda cream
In a crazy way, releasing her stream in amazing ways
Drifting to extremes in amazing ways before we did anything",https://genius.com/The-pharcyde-freaky-lyrics

There jealous ass fellas got me thinkin' about a vest
Imani:
I'm avoiding you and you crew for the obvious reasons
Because you and your man always be schemin'
Straight hatin' mine
You ain't relatin' to mine

And you tryin' to intervene on mine
Go in-between the guidelines
Yo ass is now straight hatin' from the sidelines
Cause you flyin' sidewind
Bootie Brown:
Every funny style
You know there's many people out there livin' in denial
Have a smile like it's AD but shit be like a rain cloud
No use for being loud
Talking bout your skrilla
But you askin' me for a dub to buy some killer chronic
So I find it behind at this rap shit but it's got you excited

Funny style are the true geeks
Yo Imani please use feet

Reminition is to make the ends blend and meet
But sometimes to incline can be too steep for the feet
And sometimes we might even find it feek (keep it movin')

Listen to the words I speak (keep it movin')
You only fall in deep cause you sleep

Evolution,Plain Rap,2000,"Yo..inhale, exhale
Been a long time coming, still a long way to go
Evolution of manhood
Evolution, revolution

Born with sight but became sightless
Rehabilitated visions from being frightened
In the dark, just bits of light when
Lightning sparks, thunder rumbled
Chasing courage from the heart
Searching for solitude without a solitary card
Knees bleeding but proceeding to pray to God
Forever humble but before a man boys stumble
Before there was peace vast lands had crumbled
Apart - from the truth a great distance
Met with many guides to provide assistance
To shorten that distance with me and the Maker
The mind was overthrown by the Undertaker
The Devil's a faker, see he lied to me
Singing sweet sad songs to mesmerise
But my eyes have seen four dimensions
Now gather your strength for all these bad intentions

That you seem to get when you get a little older
Days a lot colder, used to cry upon my mama's shoulder
Til pop finalised it, I analysed it, can fantasize
With your manhood, make your plan good
With the back up, unfortunately niggas act up
Seems to be no solution, too many facing execution
Then I know many ready to leave the revolution
On their evolution to manhood, manhood

When a boy becomes a man
Takes time to understand
The ways of the world today

Step by step, day by day
Don't let the negative vibes lead the 'Cyde astray
We keep the positive vibes till everything is okay
On the evolution to manhood, to manhood

We realised it then re-devised it then excercised it
Got connected and we checked and it's correct
That the soul extends far beyond this fleshy existence
The rest is still trapped in ignorance, giving resistance
From a distance, interference from far away
But neither Tim nor Anfernee had a harder way
On getting here, I'm spitting clear
Connecting with the energies from near and far away
Karma, karma come back like a riccochet
To hit ya so I'm coming with the scripture
For the fixture, get the picture?",https://genius.com/The-pharcyde-evolution-lyrics

You better stop!

It takes at least one woman true said
Though which rain doesn't calculate the fate
Sliding through the secret garden, I beg the pardons
Regarding the odds with my snake, he's such a slut
And every will of God it gets marked as a winner
Diggin in the hoes and the soap like a tenor sax
And baby got backs
Spread the fenders no one hinders yo I can't hold it back
In the darkness, many play like they won't get caught and
Every day we be up there stalkin
Pay attention when you're harkin embarkin
Territories never throws until we see the dolphin
Caught in the tuna net, cause you will get
A birds eye triple high noose to the neck
Yo, who's read to go?
When Slim brings Grim to the show?
You better stop!
And think about it

You better stop!

The beauty of the booty got me in a trance
In my pants I be squirmin, like Pee Wee Herman
From a single table dance but she knows I beez
No Pee Weed, cause I beez
Kingin like Kong cause my ding-a-ling's long
With my ding dong I make crotches sing songs
Make the guts say praise I'll pays for the duty
The day I go sliding, bare in a room
In a butt hot greasy slot
Without my unraveling what knots
What I gots is a plan and a plot
Already got the crotch, hoppin like scotch
Ready hot and willin but I know the penicillin ain't killin
This Public Enemy, so it's gonna be
Doomsday for the gift I flip
Gotta get a grip, crip, blood be trippin when I'm whippin
Asses like cream, I know what you mean
I try to comply with the gameplan don't ask me why
I zips down my fly and pry open the thigh
Here's where I catch like fish
Without using my wack ass prophylactics
You better stop!
And think about it...
(repeat 2X)

Not feelin very smart as the Doctor tears the chart
With my heart in my neck, oh heck
What have I done? Thrown all my cards on the table
For just one night of fun, I wish it wasn't cable
But the second time around in a town we performed at last week
Yeah needless to speak
Spotted the physique that caught my eye
Next morning woke up butt naked and high
On life not my wife like a knife I stab
Placed them on tabled still I did not grab
Now with a gown I wear and a frown I stare
Into the light, prayin that the overnight passion
Will not cash this ass in, so I'm askin
God it won't be odd cause I've asked before
Just right then the Doc entered the door
Hey, welcome back again Mr. Robinson!
Now see ahh, have you ever thought about ahh, using those...
Roll me on

L.A.,Plain Rap,2000.0,"Yo, I dedicate this to you and you and you
And you and you and you
And you right there

Yeah, broadcasting live and direct from sunny
Sunny sunny shiny Southern California
Where it never rains, I’ve warned ya
About the G’s, and the palm trees, and the convertible lo-lo
G-rides, bitches, and beaches, and britches and bean pies
Freaks with green eyes
Guys wearing disguise, used to be men
Now they women trying to blend in
Yeah, all from the town from the sound
Known for the niggas that’s known to get down
And isn’t it ironic
It’s more to L.A. than drive-by shootings, carjackings and 
The Chronic
Yeah, look a little closer
Move real slow and do what you’re supposed to
Got a poster with Kobe-Kob’ and Shaq
Home of the Lakers and the money-makers, that’s a fact

And we’re living in the lifestyle
Living with the rich and famous and the poor and aimless
Living where life’s wild
Doing the same old same and we do it again

LA LA, the city of smog
Some gangstas wear suit and ties, some drive a hog
Went to the same high school, even shared a class
One quick to sue, the other quick to blast
Me, I don’t ask what’s wrong or right
Nubian queen turned hoochie in the night
Also turn vampire and they bite, leaving marks to switch
Rollin’ on Wilshire with the poor and rich

Never gave me the time of day
Now I’m just a rhyme away, from the summit
Now they tryin’ to find a way, to spark somethin’
After we done marked somethin’
Like dogs do, already involved
Embers in the dark shed light into the park
So we can play again
Heart’s been astray, now I know the way again
Big old price to pay again
After layin’ ‘round, you know the sound

And we’re living in the lifestyle
Living with the rich and famous and the poor and aimless
Living where life’s wild
Doing the same old same and we do it again


Shielded by the spirit of debt
1-5’er, 1-9’er, ’71 is when the mission begun in Irvine
I’ve been all around but I really love the Cali sunshine

See, it’s a very small world (where we’re from)

No place like it in the world (where we’re from)

Hustlers and fly girls trying to get some

Welcome to the place where the sun submerge
The sky’s not the only place where stars emerge
On dreams we purge, to kill our urge
Aspirations embedded like handprints at the Chinese
Convertible down, warm Santa Ana breeze
While you’re cruisin’ on the 10, from sand to sand
Some represent with the ‘W’ on their hand
Often I say “dude”, I’m talking to my man
Grab the tan in the laid back land
There’s nine million stories and every game ran",https://genius.com/The-pharcyde-la-lyrics

Pass it around so we all could

Dream of other styles, captivate, (meditate)
Open a bag that hasn't been touched
A pile of bud, a sack of blunts
Get backwoods to get back, good
Fools...
...number one cash drop
Five g's to drop
With no seeds to pop
Time to recop
Throw the stress in the trash can

At the afghan
Of the herb i'm a fan

Can't you see i'm
Gonna get some

Fuzzy like gerbals

To the paper i stick it
Fine lime fruity smell makes even staights wanna kick it

Clipped and transplanted

Rockin weed, kool aid punch, neslie crunch
Crunch buds

But I didn't want to pass it up
To the next man had my Walkman bumpin' on
The fifty yard line and my adrenaline pumpin'
Like a kill thriller, driller tiller out with the miller brew
Filler up, took it til' the damn Dutch puked
Luke Skywalker ain't a sweet talker so I got ill
With my light saber that came in one fancy flavor
My strange behavior led to an outburst
The night felt good but the day got worse
I thought I was alone slim trade the stowaway
With a brown-eyed bombshell that was dope enough to pay
I looked over my shoulder and my cover was peeled
By my whole school sayin', ooh and I'm busted for real
Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit

'Cuz I stepped into his house, his mom's grinnin' ear to ear
Gigglin' and winks for weeks
I would encounter from this female
She's sizin' me up for the kill
Oh, what the hell is what I said to myself
So that I wouldn't worry, I'm sittin' on the couch
And wish Greg would please hurry up
She offered me a cup of ripple, broke out the titty
Squeezed her nipple, said suck it if you like but please don't bite it
I had an urge to say fuck it but I knew I had to fight it
Before I could say alakazam 
I took this old bitch in a doggie style
Greg walked in the room that nigga cold had a fit
But all this numskull could say was, oh shit

Come on
One fine summertime Sunday evening
Crenshaw Boulevard was in full swing
Perfect example of how looks can be deceiving
Rolled up to what I thought was a pretty young thing
Rollin' in a purple Samurai Suzuki
Dookie braids was an aid to her sex appeal
Dude she was dope man, real dope
On the wheel
Well, anyway I went toot, toot she said hey, a beep, beep
The next day rolled down to the beach
Tuesday me and my new Crenshaw cutie
Coolin' on the beach and now she's rubbin' on my booty
Suck, suck, suckin' on my neck like Dracula
But it wasn't all that spectacular
Why?
'Cuz every time I tried to touch upon her tay titty
She would be like quit B, bitch was frontin' but I didn't say nothin'
Then all of the sudden after someone pushed the button
I got a funny feeling like something was real wrong
Looked at her shoes and her feet's was real long
Then it hit me, oh please God no
Don't let this ho turn out to be a John doe
He pulled a fast one on me, yo
I guess that's one of those things that make you go, shit

Feeling,Chapter One: Testing the Waters,2000,"It's the Cyde that you feel still
When you're sexing
Getting hyper, trying to chill
Clean you in thrills, collect mils
Leaving suckas at a standstill
Instead of going out we're going uphill

Yo, we come tri-annual, haters check your manuals
Pharcyde beats are labelled as 'highly flammable'
You're running loose like a wild animal
Lawless, thinking you're flawless
But they bought this from Hawthorne to Hollis
You're too faded, you can't do what we created
That shit is way outdated, they can't contain or explain
The way we come with a real flow, we still glow titanium
Hitting you hard in your cranium
You look like you need some wheat grass
Some calcium or some Java juice
What's good for the duck duck goose is good for the gander
Take a gander, fuck the red tape and the propaganda
The real shit is rare like a panda
We're trying to expand on the previous
Trying to get the shit together like staples or seams
Cause niggas got dreams


When I hear a tight beat I get anxious, ready
Like fifty niggas out the County at a Luke party
With 151 Bacardi and a stick of the stickiest
Meticulous when it's got to represent us
I can't trust in no kay, come with it or forget it
We move on to improve on and keep warm
While suckers only want to get a slap of reality
And some change, they call us strange
But worldwide we range coming to a city near you
Pharcyde here you entrancing, memorizing
Stem realising, instant malignment evil
But we're cerebral, I know it's torture to await
The reemergence of the Cyde
Banging in your club, tilt and your ride
Trying to bubble like peroxide
And heal the wound of the hip-hop neglected
And keep working to perfect it


You're too near me to hear me, cross-eyed to see clearly
Side winding like a snake and yet you try to steer me
Veer me into oncoming traffic, hold up, dearie
You're looking kind of leery, I'm trying to stay cheery
While you're tired and weary, unable to stay stable
Unable to keep afloat, unable to rock a note
So you bring a good friend down by the throat
And most of y'all bite on anything like a goat
And when you're hot you're hot, when you're not you turn cold
Lack of understanding what that provokes
Not loyal to the movement of the militant folks
But you're good at blowing smoke up my ass like I love it
Glad to rise above it, I don't need this shit
Too many jackasses to deal with
Like pleasure isle, we lace the mic with style and finesse",https://genius.com/The-pharcyde-feeling-lyrics

Flakin on your girlfriends
Gettin' lost on carol anne

In between the social margin

Who rocks who rocks unorthodox
Methods to wreck it so expect shit to get hectic

The fly hits bullseye respect it

And still get attention
And still it should be noted
They all folded from me and potent quote yeah
We rock words unorthodox awkward
Hey you gotta get it together or leave it alone
You gotta lead the way or be the clone
Stand there before the world holdin' microphones
You gotta freak what ya feel cause to each is own
Don't like what I kick you can't see my zone
I'm from deeper galaxies than regions unknown
And my legion is grown in amazin' ways
Preparing for these crazy days hey

Gotcha Lookin,UnKnown,1996.0,"(“Got an eye on every move I make”)

Back in the day I had a friend
He thought that he was the one who would bring me within
The spirit realm and beyond
But then I found out that that friend, his whole mind was gone
The devil that he served tried to bring him through
But I tell you this, the Lord has come true
In my heart and he blocked that thing from happenin’
Yo kid, that’s why I’m rappin’ in
The studio with my brothers though I don’t really understand
But yo, I have command
And authority over spirits that try to block my mental capacity and come near it
They can’t touch this, they cannot come true
My name is Raghib Ismail, child of God to you
Don’t ask me this, or that, or those
Because those who you see on the ground were my foes

Why does it feel like somebody’s watching me?
(“Got an eye on every move I make”)
Why does it feel like somebody’s watching me?
(“Got an eye on every move I make”)

They say I’m off my rocker, I’m funky like a locker
In a school gymnasium; like Captain Kirk, I’m phasing ‘em
Stunning ‘em, crazy games, I stopped running ‘em
Like red lights with the warrants, because they’re watching
Anticipating, and called what’s worse, fighting and hating
Both cause for jealousy, due to lack of attention
They try all means to get it
Some get lucky, but 99 percent forget it
Because of my occupation I’m always under observation
Constant surveillance, and I’m losing my patience with this
See, they wanna see it, be it, from the view of a rifle scope binoculars
Right down to the microscope
And that ain’t dope (Nope) but still there’s hope
While I wait at the crossroads with faith
Me, myself and all eyes open, hoping for the best
Yes, and to this there’s no contest, yes

Why does it feel like somebody’s watching me?
(“Got an eye on every move I make”)
Why does it feel like somebody’s watching me?
(“Got an eye on every move I make”)

Simply put, go ahead and take a second look
Since you’re always checking my every move I make
Don’t you like everything you see?
Why does it feel like somebody’s always watching me?


Yo, give us your undivided attention
And listen in and understand the entire transmission
Image is nothin’ so stop frontin’
Image is nothin’ so won’t you please, please stop
What you make is fake as an extension
Weave, trying to make me believe make-believe, please
All of y’all priorities is out of alignment
That’s why you wonderin’ where your quality time went
Yeah, you just don’t know
Yeah, big mackin’, actin’ cool with the flow
Yeah, big mackin’, actin’ cool, but you’re my description of a fool

Don’t overlook the details, pick up the pieces
Fools are getting caught, now they’re looking for a Jesus
Make you, up your time real wisely
Despise me, but I shake ‘em like ivory
When they try to tag along, they know they end up only keep persisting
I keep resisting their assisting to create
An illusion of their own
I know I’m not alone, I know many smell the danger
The eyes of a stranger that’s lookin’…
