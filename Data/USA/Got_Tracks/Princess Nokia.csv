Hop in the whip, hop in the truck
I do whatever the fuck that I want
I'm not a ho, I'm not a slut
I like to fuck and I sure like to suck
I am that bold, freezy like ice
I'm not a wife, so talk to me nice
You ain't my type, I don't like you
You a broke boy, look at your shoes
I am the player and I am the pimp
All of them boys, make 'em the trick
All of them boys, they on my shit
But all of them boys, they make me sick

I do not see you taming me
'Less them, they're entertaining me
They just tryna p-play with me

Dibble in this, and dibble in that
Get on his head like I am a brat
Play with his balls when he up to bat
Make daddy real proud like I'm Kyla Pratt
I'm taking a shower, he makin' the bed
When I leave the city, I leave him on read
Go get the next, like I get the bread
He coming with questions, I call him the feds
He let me plead the fifth
'Cause he know this box a gift
Eating breakfast, not at Tiff'
When I curve him he get stiff
I go beast mode
Ball like free throw
Game like cheat code
Pounds like kilo

I like him, like him too
He my man, he my boo
He my type, he so cute
I want him, and I want him too

I cast a circle in white and I can vanquish your spite
And if you hex me with hate then I'ma conjour the light
Your evil ways put no fight,

Tituba! Voodoo slave girl who graced us with her 
black magic
You made her a slave
Before that she came from a great tribe, the Arawak
She gave it to your girls of Salem
A gift repaid with betrayal
Maybe you ain't heard the news about civilization starting in Africa
We more than just pins in dolls and seeing the future in chicken parts
Been reading too many tourist guides, hm
Everything you got, you got from us",https://genius.com/Princess-nokia-brujas-lyrics

You don't practice, you preach, I get applause when I speak
It's a difference for me, people comin' for me
I gotta show them that heat so they regret how they be
They take advantage of me, and I'ma put them to sleep
You never shit where you eat when you was eatin' for free
I really say what I do and ain't got nothing to prove
Prefer the sweetheart chick to my bitch attitude
People did me they dirt when I sat and did work

I'm that weird girl that's runnin' shit
I'm a boss bitch runnin' big shit
Got a company, need a couple mil'
Ain't no rap talk, this my real life
And that's on God, I almost died twice
So I go 'head, and I get mine
And I cash checks, and I get fly
Pelle Pelle with the BB belt
Skinny jeans and a studded belt
I've been fly, never needed help
I been me, ain't nobody else
Skinny jeans and a pair of Vans
Pants sag 'til they hit my ass
Lit, lit, I'ma do my dance
Like a raver bitch goin' in a trance
Avril, I'm a sk8er boi
Anime and a lot of tours
MySpace, made a lot of noise
That's middle school and I'm actin' coy
Back of the class, they sending my ass
Roll up my skirt and they think that I'm fast
I got no ass and I got no titties
But all of your dudes, they hit me to hit me

Hold up a minute
You know I ain't did it
That is your man
And that ain't my business
So come for me different
You can make fun of me
But my bank account statement is somethin'
Is somethin', is somethin' to see
I've been down with the shits
The rap shit I do it, you bet
I ain't the best
But damn I'm the best
You might get hit
Or you might get checked
So don't disrespect
Or it will be hit for the neck

This shit is the illest
This that Scream 3, finna kill shit
I'm a rap boo and a misfit
And I throw 'bows in the moshpit
I bump bump that Gangsta Boo
That Loco, that La Chat
I respect that trill shit
And them OGs that really rap
I'm already back with some new shit
You Dionne and I'm clueless
I got my own movement
I do this, I move shit
I change rap forever, man
It's me who had the biggest plan
Ain't no average bitch, I've been the man
I've been the G.O.A.T, eatin' off the land
It's me who took the weirdo shit
To another level, and I'm killin' it
They ain't want me, that's beginnin' -ish

Bart Simpson,1992,2016.0,"Rotten apple to the core, damn, I been a fuck up
Gettin' picked for last in gym, I can't even do a lay up
Writing on my sneakers, being sneaky with my teachers
Smokin' weed under the bleachers, cuttin' out and gluein' pictures
Carryin' my CD player, suckin' on a Now or Later
Sour Apple was the flavor, scribblin' on doodle paper
Tryin' hard to pay attention but I have no real direction
So I say, ""yo, fuck this lesson,"" spark the leaf, my back is stressin'
Who I am and where I'm headed, cuttin' school and actin' crazy
Foster care done got me crazy, living with a crazy lady
Every day I'm always late, puffin' on a skimpy J
Staying in my grandma house, wasn't even far away
But I guess that's what I do, makin' life more difficult for me and you

Ay caramba
Bart Simpson with the shits
Ay caramba, man, you can go and suck my dick
Skatin' down the street, being mischievous as shit
This as good as it gon' get, always cheat on yo' tests
Don't you be like the rest, I ain't no teacher's pet

Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
If that don't work then, deny, deny, deny
Lookin' to my future is like lookin' at the sky
Inner city orphan with my hand in apple pie
A liar, a schemer, a cheater, I do it all
I used to switch schools each comin' fall
I skipped all my classes and still managed to pass them all
Readin' comics in Forbidden Planet
I go home to a place of fantasy outside my own
Always been a loner, never had a solid home
I really like Marvel 'cause characters look just like me
And women don't have roles that make them look too sexually
I lie a lot from gettin' beaten and put off food, I'm not eatin'
Eczema so bad I'm bleedin', but I smile and keep it cheesin'
A nerdy girl with nymphomaniac tendencies
Everyone's offended but nobody here offended me
90's mami dressin' like Aaliyah, quite apparently
I'm heavy with the theory, I move with the groove
I'm Black like Shaolin, I tang with the Wu
Africa, my guy, with the bantu do
I'm stupid, fuckin' crazy nuts, loose like a screw
See, I know my money, got raised by the Jews
I'm a New York Puerto Rican like a rough kinda dude
I'ma hit the barrio and eat some Spanish food
And sit in Central Park, I'm in a New York mood

Bart Simpson with the shits
Ay caramba, man, you can go and suck my dick
Skatin' down the street, being mischievous as shit
This as good as it gon' get, always cheat on yo' tests

Mine,1992,2016.0,"Um...is that a wig?
I'm confused, is that a weave?
Is that your real hair?
No, you can't touch my fuckin hair! You ain't got no manners!
Oh my God!

It's mine, I bought it, it's mine, I bought it
It's mine, I bought it, it's mine, I bought it
It's mine, I bought it, it's mine, I bought it
It's mine, I bought it, it's mine, I bought it

I like the Dominicans who rock they weaves innocent
Shout out the Boricua girls who rock yaki ponytails
Big up to my Africans who braid, many hours spent
They own they own businesses and work while they care for kids
You know I love auntie girls with Sunday best bonnet curls
And love to my Asian chicks who make hair go straight as shit
I love how West Indies do, it's gossip with hair and food
I love how West Indies do, it's gossip with hair and food

Bundles, bundles, bundles, hit that plug up for the bundles
Beauty shop supply, cashier ringin' up them numbers
Rock my many styles then go natural for the summer
Hair blowin' in the hummer, flip the weave, I am a stunner
Bundles, bundles, bundles, hit that plug up for the bundles
Beauty shop supply, cashier ringin' up them numbers
Rock my many styles then go natural for the summer

It's mine, I bought it, it's mine, I bought it
It's mine, I bought it, it's mine, I bought it
It's mine, I bought it, it's mine, I bought it

Look how I stunt, look how I stunt
Look how I stunt, look how I stunt, in my lace front
10's to the floor, 10's through the door
10's to your face, 5, you a bore
Pick up the pace, spit in your face
Dawson, your creek, Joey to pace
Glue in my weave, Ms. Destiny
Lil Banji, bruise on my knee
Dip on the dip, makin' a trip
Wanna talk slick, I blow them a kiss
Glue in my weave, Ms. Destiny
Lil Banji, bruise on my knee

Bundles, bundles, bundles, hit that plug up for the bundles
Beauty shop supply, cashier ringin' up them numbers
Rock my many styles then go natural for the summer

Bundles, bundles, bundles, hit that plug up for the bundles
Beauty shop supply, cashier ringin' up them numbers
Rock my many styles then go natural for the summer
Hair blowin' in the hummer, flip the weave, I am a stunner

Please do not ask me or any Black or Brown women if our hair is real or not. If it’s a wig, a weave, extensions, braids, don’t fuckin' ask. It’s very rude, it’s extremely personal to be put on the spot like that. How we choose to wear our hair is our personal choice, ok? We bought it, it’s ours, so have some manners and keep your curiosity to yourself",https://genius.com/Princess-nokia-mine-lyrics

Sometimes it works out for people
Sometimes it really just doesn't
Don't do this shit to be famous
I do this shit 'cause I love it

You have to rise up above it

How you want what I have?
You ain't workin' yourself

Ain't really good for your health

ABCs of New York,1992 Deluxe,2017.0,"A is for the apple, take a bite and spit it out
B is for bodega, eatin' on your mama couch
Low bazooka with a Puerto-Rican chula
Says she workin' in the city and she gettin' moolah
C is for the crib, the cats that call you catch
CBGB's babies sneakin' blondie through the back
D is for the downtown kids that's hittin' licks
Skater boys in the park tryna fuck some white chicks
E is for the East Side, Ruff Ryder Ride or Die
Motorbikes from every side
Flyin' down the FDR, breakin' Dutches in the car
G is for the ghetto girl and Rainbow clothes
Baby hairs and well done toes, single mothers carry those
Bummy sneakers, what are those? Get in goin', golden go
Hunts Point got the hottest hoes, inner city, tragic woes
Splattered streets, the bloody holes, shorty dancin' on the pole
Casually it's casual b, bloody hands with the anatomy
Jehovah witness at your door, actin' like nobody home
TV off, all alone, kick the door in, mama Jonesin' on the phone
Bata and a doobie on, waiting on her tax return
Low lives lightin' Ls, pourin' down for ones they love
Tompkins Square, lower east, Delancey for the deli meats
You don't come to C or D
I'm in Manhattan like I'm Woody Allen
Jewish, Puerto-Rican and a little bit Italian
Sittin' on the steps outside the Natural History
New York fuckin' City and I love the history
Everything a meltin' pot, every block is fuckin' hot
83rd the train stop, open cases, old as shorty braces
Pick you up on warrant squad, now they runnin' faces
Pick you up by the park, we was voguing by the pier
Paris burnin', full of Queens, hit the Village every year
Rollin' now to the rave, Village Voice, six page
I was diving off the stage, going now, every day
Stickball in the summer, you know it's summertime
Schomburg, eatin' soul food, singin' Doo-Wop every night
Subway trains goin' by, squad is sittin' St. Marks
Shootin' up in Tompkins park, know it's dirty after dark
Tunnels takin' turns, playin' tag on the curb
Touchin' on some titties, takin' change out your purse
Undercover agents I can spot them all away
Yo, I hate the fuckin' cops, NYPD get away
Underground are MTA, close my eyes and ride the train
Back and forth on everyday, anywhere, anyway
Xerox copied Zines stapled onto poser trees
Got a show, come and see, New York is the place to be
Here you go and live your dreams
Livin' in the city you can't be a xenophobe
This the melting pot, and the soup is never cold

Gemini,Everything is Beautiful,2020.0,"I am Gemini, super fly, fly guy
I am Gemini, two heads, one eye
I am Gemini, like Pac, André, Lauryn
And Kanye, Boy George, and Anne Frank
I am Gemini, but no, I'm not fake
I am Gryffindor, but don’t move like snake
I am Gemini, people love to call me crazy
But they judging, and they hating, and I'm too grown for explaining
I am Gemini, June 14th
And all the famous rappers got a sign like me
And all the famous rappers got a heart like me
But I know that I'm different and they’re not quite me
I'm the horoscope ho, I'm the planet and moon
I'm the rising ascendant, fifth degree to the Moon
I'm the witch of your dreams, I'm the voice in your head
Your husband sent me a DM and I just left him on read
My planet's Mercury, my element is air
I'm such a free spirit that I don’t fucking care
If I got a blunt I ain’t moving out my chair
You can kiss my derrière 'cause it’s shaped like a pear

Little zodiac, ginger snap
Pretty little shorty with the snapback
Tarot deck, Ankh set
Like to get her feet wet with Keith Sweat
The freaknik, from Harlem to BX
I clean up like Kleenex
Spinelli, I'm recess, kickball to the deep end
The public school era, it's old-school forever
The moon and the tides really control the weather
The sun and the moon, yes, it do go together
A spiritual being that rides any weather

Riders on the storm, riders on the storm
Yes, I'm on my own, tryna find up my home
Riders on the storm, riders on the storm
Always on my own, tryna find up a home

Intelligent, adaptable, agile, communicative
Informative, creative, and everybody hates it
Imagination colorful and I just entertain it
A poet and a dreamer, I’ma seize the world and take it
Of course, there is the bad, I'm really superficial
I ain't called you in three months, still I maintain that I miss you
A Gemini with issues, social, isolated
I pray that I'ma make it or at least that I can fake it
And like a Gemini, I'm really prone to changes
I'm really indecisive and I really fuckin' hate it
Picking food or picking clothes, it always make me anxious
But thank God I'm androgynous, 'cause boys clothes what I stay in

Riders on the storm, riders on the storm
Yes, I'm on my own, tryna find up my home
Riders on the storm, riders on the storm
Always on my own, tryna find up a home",https://genius.com/Princess-nokia-gemini-lyrics
Goth Kid,1992 Deluxe,2017.0,"I’m goth as fuck, even when I’m not in black
Gothic is the pain you feel and not the clothes that’s on your back
Don’t give a fuck about the fun you make of me
I’m not the type to play your role so get the fuck away from me
You make me sick and all I was was just a kid
You picked a flaw in all I did and go and make me feel like shit
I swear to God, you have no clue to how I lived
In foster care, abused as kids

Playing under my desk, a comic book in my bed
I fuck with Emily Strange and I got pins in my bag
I’m Wednesday Addams to you basic ass hoes
Marilyn Manson to you corny ass bros
I was sleepin' in the cemetery
Kinda cute, a little scary, goth as fuck, a little Carrie
You don’t know shit about me
You go assume and doubt me, I’m just like Ginger Foutley
The world was born of innies, and I was born an outie
You gonna see a side of me that you've never seen
My mind is kinda sick, and my jokes a little mean
Just a little gory, like a bloody fuckin' spleen
I been hangin' out with prostitutes and fiends

I’m goth as fuck, even when I’m not in black (goth as fuck)
Gothic is the pain you feel and not the clothes that’s on your back (that's on your back)
I don’t give a fuck about the fun you make of me

I swear to God, you have no clue to how I lived
In foster care, abused as kids

I just landed from another planet
And I think it’s time to start the madness
Stupid hungry boy, I’m famished
Take a plate of food, if moms is askin'
I’m in the project chillin' with my boys
I’m talkin' grown ass men who play with toys
Mom’s asleep, don’t make a noise
Extracurriculars is havin' sex and smokin' weed
Stealin' clothes and climbin' trees
Hustlin' kids and buyin' Ps
Duane Reade, stole the triple C’s
Trippin' hard, I try to breathe
Trippin' hard, I go to sleep
It’s a dirty game, and I’m nobody’s fool
I’d rather be myself, pretend I’m fuckin' cool
I’d rather be at home, than party where there’s hate
People makin' fun of me while smilin' in my face
I’m a nice kid and the world ain't
Got the knapsack and a fat sack
Said I’m gonna quit today, ha ha, fat chance
And at first glance, I’m so small and cute
Haven’t seen me pukin', drunk on my own shoes
I’m a big slob, I got a big job
I know who I am, I’m a real hog

I’m goth as fuck, even when I’m not in black
Gothic is the pain you feel and not the clothes that’s on your back
Don’t give a fuck about the fun you make of me

You make me sick and all I was was just a kid
You picked a flaw in all I did and go and make me feel like shit
I swear to God, you have no clue to how I lived
In foster care, abused as kids

Yellow cab, yellow bag, little sad, copped a bag and took a drag
Dwelling on the things I had, things I lost
Paid the cost, actin' stupid now, I'm tossed
I didn't mean to be mean or act obscene
I know you've had enough of me
Don't blame you every time you run away from me
A monster, see? A monster, I’ve come to be
I'm a bad kid, fuckin' rancid, burn like acid, Manson, Charlie
I'm the class clown, everybody’s favorite asshole
Unreliable, plagiarized, I am liable
It's undeniable, maniacal, I really am
Manipulative, all my teachers are frustrated",https://genius.com/Princess-nokia-goth-kid-lyrics

Rollin' up the pack, party sound wack
Think I have to pass, park, I'm smokin' gas, mom jean on my ass
Get the last laugh 'cause my name you'll never drag
Miss me, boy, the best you ever had
Drawstring on my bag
Let the pants sag
Petty, never mad
Leave it in the past
If I dwell I'ma never have the life I worked hard for
The city to explore
The money come in more
Stuck in the crib, stuck in the crib, I'm a big little kid
I'm the bottle, the bib, the baby food lid
The nipple, the lid, and I did what I did 'cause I live how I live

For $2.50 I could go anywhere I want

And I show ya my world and ya seen how I live
From the womb to the crib
And the crib to the school
And the school to the rave
And the rave to the games
Patsies for the eats, Casablancas for the meats
La Tropenzas for the bread
Went to 
Hajis
 got a philly cheese instead
Round the corner to Ollin 'cause you know I'm Mexican
Drink 
horchata
 with my peeps, hug my auntie in the street
You could find me and jeff on the court
Playing ball, football, and track
And I still play them all even though that I'm wack
Pleasant Ave, Italianos, Gottis and the Lucianos
Raos sittin' on the corner, ever been inside?
There's a guy at the table, eats fazul as he cry

Receipts,1992 Deluxe,2017.0,"No, I am not that hoe
20K, first class for a one day show
And I made so much back with the merch I sold
I am a business man, I'm no average hoe
I am the headliner, not the support, bro
I think you got it twisted, let me show you though
I am a rockstar and I'm twice as cold
These little doo-doo boys they could get up and go
I took this shit hostage and I won't let go
I am the real deal, not some SoundCloud hoe
Oh you really doin' numbers? Ask about me though
Oh you think you're hot? Let me prove you cold
Little boys, oh you think you got toys?
Little boys, oh you think you make the noise?
Little boys, oh you think you got the heat?
Little boys, oh you think you from the street?
Nah bro, shut your dumbass up
Y'all them goofy hypebeasts with your double cups
Everybody in your squad, but it's just three blunts
Oh you waitin' on that sour, boy you fuckin' up
Pay attention, pay attention when a grown up talk
You are not fuckin' rich and you don't hold no work
All your music's fuckin' corny and it sound the same
Let me guess, you just waited to put on your team
I am sorry, I am sorry, I am not this mean
All you circulation cuttin' off them skinny jeans
You're all the court jesters and I am the queen
All y'all do is walk SoHo and y'all act like fiends

Double XL done featured me, well
How the fuck does that feel? No you don't wish me well
No, you hope that I fail, but I won't 'cause I can't
It's 
Return of the Mack
 and I'm lit to the max
And I really count stacks, this a tour back to back
And I got a catalogue, it's iconic as fuck
Three albums in three years, damn I'm good as fuck
It's 2017 and you out of luck
This is Princess Nokia, I don't give no fucks
I just light my L and I do my work
Make a big exhale then I turn and burp
You don't like my style? Well okay, that's cool
'Cause my money real long and I am not like you
I'm an old school hoe with a new school flow
I refuse to be supportin', got my own damn show
I'm a headline that, that's my racks on racks
I'ma send it all out and I'mma make that bag
See a bill full of dudes, I don't play that shit
I'm a motherfuckin' superstar, you heard me bitch
I'm a motherfuckin' legend, not some lit rap bitch
And I refuse to open for a dude that really ain't shit

Laughin' at the rappers who got ego in they pocket
Always talkin' money but they never ever got it
They always gotta flex it, if you rich then you don't stress it
The less you show, the more you have and let that be a lesson",https://genius.com/Princess-nokia-receipts-lyrics
Look Up Kid,A Girl Cried Red,2018.0,"Smash my heart in pieces, it looks so good on the floor

Days slip into years of wounds that bleed fresh
Suffer in silence, is what you do best
You have no guidance, no person to tell
You're bleedin' on the inside but ain't nobody here can tell
Your smile is a mask, you wear it so well
The darkness you carry has given you hell
I know it gets scary but you will be fine
You won't have to deal with the voice in your mind

Look up kid
I see your face, you are going through something
Look up kid
It gets better but you won't even know it
Look up kid
I see your face, you are going through something
Look up kid

Don't forget the darkness always turns to light
You will have to fight for the sanity you find
Go and find a corner, a place where you can pray
And hope to God you'll make it, with every second that you make
Destiny's callin' and I call your bluff
Tell me you're tryin', you can't give up
Moments that count 'cause in the end
You'll say you made it, you'll say that you'll win

Look up kid
I see your face, you are going through something
Look up kid
It gets better but you won't even know it
Look up kid
I see your face, you are going through something
Look up kid

Don't hit the ground, don't turn around
I won't come back 'til you're safe and you're sound
Help you calm down, make you come 'round
I'll never leave you, I promise I'm down
If I'm out of town, if I'm out of bound
I will come get you sooner than now
I'm beggin' you now, I'm beggin' you now

At the Top,A Girl Cried Red,2018.0,"Fuck a co-sign, doing mine, I was made to shine
Lights so bright, little bitch, and I could make you blind
Don't nobody care in this world, everything is cold
Like my heart in the morgue, everything's a tag a toe
I ain't suckin' dick for no play, must be out your mind
Gettin' on my knees, tryna please, must be suicide
We won't get along 'cause it's wrong, I'm not tryna change
They would do you dirty in a hurry, wouldn't have to wait
I don't want your clout or a pic that's a fuckin' joke
Some make me sick with the shit that they tryna smoke
You can play pretend with your friends that I ain't the shit
You can keep ignorin' all the facts and what I really did
You can try to front all my life that I came up
Million off a mixtape, that's a fact and I don't need to front
People think I'm wack, but they suckin' dick
The money I'm gettin' makes everyone sick

It get lonely at the top and I do it by myself
I got everything I want without anybody help
Do you think I give a fuck? Only care about myself
I'm a stone-cold killer, couple notches on my belt
It get lonely at the top and I do it by myself
I got everything I want without anybody help
Do you think I give a fuck? Only care about myself
I'm a stone-cold killer, couple notches on my belt

I don't front for the 'Gram, this is just who I am
I don't ride on no wave, I don't tag on no plan
I don't fuck for no clout, I don't beg for no man
I don't care about fame, I just care about bands
I came out of the mud and I smile 'cause I can
People look down on me, on account who I am
And they point and they judge, they do not understand
And they talking on me but I don't give a damn
Back to back tour, even more, I'm a superstar
Throwin' shots at me, bitch please, I see everything
Only problem now is your grind make you look weak
I am fuckin' grown, ain't no little girl in the street
I'm nice to all, I don't gotta beef
I just want the bag, and you can have the street

It get lonely at the top and I do it by myself
I got everything I want without anybody help
Do you think I give a fuck? Only care about myself
I'm a stone-cold killer, couple notches on my belt

Voices in my head, monsters under my bed
I'm alone again, I lost all my friends
Wanna play pretend? Hope this never ends
Talkin' to myself, know I crashed and burned (I crashed and I burned)
Think they hate my guts, yeah, what I heard
Everything my fault, when will I learn?
Three days in the house, feelin' sick and disturbed

Bring me your flowers, I'll bring you my rope
Play all the records that we love the most
Bring me your flowers, I'll bring you my rope
Play all the records that we love the most

Fighting my demons, they keep tryna win
Life of a loner, I want it to end
Hurt myself and I gave it three nights
Told her I love her, I thought it'd be nice
It was my fault and I live with regret
She was a beauty and I paid my debts
Flowers and rope had appeared on her chest
Thought she was different but she's like the rest

Just a Kid,Everything Sucks,2020.0,"Got the beat by Powers and we just made a banger

Now damn, I'm just a kid
Thinking 'bout everything I ever done did
Things I wanna do and things I've done lived
Everything slow, but I really wanna live, now say
Damn, I'm just a kid
Thinking 'bout everything I wanna do and did
Thinking 'bout if I go far or go big
Thinking 'bout if I go dumb or go big

I'm a child just like no other
When I get scared I hide under covers
On a sad day, man, I really miss my mother
Only get one and you never get another
When I was a child, I was barely loved
Mommy passed away and my daddy was on drugs
Granny took me in with her 5 kids
And up until 8, that's where I always live
Granny got sick and then she passed away
And biggest heartbreak that I ever did take
Things were so good, man, things were so great
And then in one day, my whole life had changed
Suddenly, I'm out here adopted
No one from my family gave me the option
To live with my family or someone familiar
Gave me away to a person with hidden agendas
Passed to stranger who needed the money
She was a psycho, she never loved me
Damn, my whole life, everyone had to fuck me
Wow, I guess I'm just lucky

Now damn, I'm just a kid
Thinking 'bout everything I ever done did
Things I wanna do and things I've done lived
Everything slow, but I really wanna live, now say
Damn, I'm just a kid
Thinking 'bout everything I wanna do and did
Thinking 'bout if I go far or go big
Thinking 'bout if I go dumb or go big

I never mattered, nobody ever cared
Gave me to strangers who claimed me as theirs
I was abused and I was aware
She told me to lie and say that I had fell
Damn, I got marks on my face
Disassociate and my thoughts go erased
Numb in my soul, I feel so out of place
Long way from home, I need out of this place
I'm the sad kid and the bad kid
I'm a disappointment and I'm average
Never make her proud, all I do is damage
Called me a burden, but she took advantage

Now damn, I'm just a kid
Thinking 'bout everything I ever done did
Things I wanna do and things I've done lived
Everything slow, but I really wanna live, now say
Damn, I'm just a kid
Thinking 'bout everything I wanna do and did
Thinking 'bout if I go far or go big
Thinking 'bout if I go dumb or go big

She said she loved me, she didn't like me
I wasn't special and I wasn't likely
Wasn't that cute, no one would want me
Nobody cared, in that, I was forgotten
Left as an orphan, no other options
She hit me again and I want her to stop it
The place of my soul has grown microscopic
They take me on weekends and act like they care
I lived in fear, I was young, I was scared
The scars of my childhood have followed me here
The patterns repeat and they come back right here
The patterns repeat and they come back right here",https://genius.com/Princess-nokia-just-a-kid-lyrics

Accomplished shit that you bitches could never
Who cares if you bad 'cause I'm smart and I'm clever
Act nice just to get by
Deep down, I hate you guys
You guys are not my type
Don't fuck with your dumb hype
19, savage
Last year, that was practice
New new, action
Fuck the game, I got passion
Glowing up, satisfaction
New year, reaction
Been down, it was tragic
Now I go hard like it's madness
I'm a rockstar, I like fashion

Glove off, mask off
Real soft, me
Glove off, mask off
Real soft, me
Glove off, mask off

You know Princess be the mood board
You know Princess be the mood for
Industry bitches who wanna be different
You still selling pop, who the fuck is you kidding?
But they copy and paste, but they can't erase
My right or my place, I show them my face
I give them the eye, people said I was a witch
Now I'm taking what's mine
I'm that little witch girl with your name in the pot
People wanna do me evil, now you see what I got
Now I'm flying on my broom, going straight to the top

Blogs, Vogue
Front row show
Campaign, let's go
Politics, no-no
Hip-hop, high school
Rap game, shit show
People don't give me my props
Fuck, I don't like them big opps",https://genius.com/Princess-nokia-practice-lyrics

Paved, the streets are mean

Stitches in their face

She don't wear no chain, play no game

Don't abuse the muse, 'cause art the one they use
The butterfly's too good
And she deserves better, and when you did her wrong
You started off the ticking bomb
She's young in age but knows her sage
She knows a page or two from the book of the luck
Destroy even the baddest hook
She puts a good fight, escaping in the night to do what's right
Sweet little child, who daydreams of suicide
Don't cry a little, gumdrop eyes
You'd be surprised who will demise
The chosen poison, she's sweet when she's unnoticed
To the sky, she is the closest
She don't consort with mortals
She don't consort with mortals

Like to make jokes, but they think that I'm crazy
I know that I'm perfect the way God had made me
And I thank my parents for the life they gave me
Have you told your parents that you loved them lately?
I look like my mama in the 1980's
If I been bad, well, please forgive me
I remember when my granny used to hit me
Public school and two Thanksgivings
Purple corduroys with the matching ribbon
Lil' puffy jacket and the T-shirt gilded

Wake up in the morning
Look into the fridge
Grab some eggs out

To accept the things that I cannot change
The courage to change the things I can
And the wisdom to know the difference

Enjoying one moment at a time
Accepting hardships as a pathway to peace
Taking, as Jesus did

And supremely happy with You forever in the next

I'm talking to my God, yes, it's righteous
And everything is fine bless, is fine bless
I blow the trees with no stress, I focus
I'm getting back to oldest, the oldest

No ego, no ego, no ego
No people, no people, no people
Let me go, let me go, let me go
And I am free, and I am free
And I am free, and I am free
(No ego, no ego, no ego)

I've been letting go, I've been blowing off some smoke
I've been climbing up the stairwell, Heaven, coming back from Hell
Like the Ring, Girl from the Well, I was put under a spell
I had lost myself a little, had my heart locked in a cell
Now I open up my soul, give you heart, and teeth, and bones
And my heart is all exposed, from my mistakes and my woes
Woman, I am strong, woman, I do belong
Woman, I take the hate, and, yes, I make into a song
How many times I fall? How many do I get up?
You think opinions matter, but I just don't give a fuck
Crazier than the weather, unwavering like the sea
Impulsive like a fire, but my roots was made from trees
The blessing from He, straight from God
I pray for enemies, but please don't think that I forgot

No ego, no ego, no ego
No people, no people, no people
Let me go, let me go, let me go
And I am free, and I am free
And I am free, and I am free
(No ego, no ego, no ego)",https://genius.com/Princess-nokia-i-am-free-lyrics
The Conclusion,Everything is Beautiful,2020.0,"I don't sing well, but, fuck, I'm a genius
I turn my heartbreak to poetry when it shatter in pieces
Don't fall in love with a poet, they really are leeches
Kissin' Kate Barlow and a jar full of peaches
I'm just like Zero from 
Holes
, a foster kid and it shows
And I make fun of my woes, 'cause I be doped up on hope
Here is the conclusion, I love making music
Even if it didn't make me money, I would do it
I love writing poetry and I love acting stupid
I take my experiences and I go out and do it
I'm bad at spoken word, so I became a rapper
And sometimes I'm a model, and sometimes I'm an actor
I've played with many looks, and sung in many songs
Everything that I release is something that I know
All my albums differ, and I am really proud of that
People think it's silly, but I will never dial back
'Cause I like to experiment, and I see nothing wrong with that
I like trying different things, and I like spreading out my wings
You see, I don't care what people think or what they speak of me
Hi, my name is Destiny, and I'm a good person
I see that you're mean to me and I did not deserve it
I survived from trauma and I'm living out my purpose
And I'm sure you are too, we're really not that different
I hope that when you listen to this album, you just listen
And find it in your heart to listen to the words and rhythm
And excerpts from my diary that were my mental prison

The girl cried and it rained
The sun started to come out
The girl cried and it rained
The sun started to come out
The girl cried and it rained
The sun started to come out and",https://genius.com/Princess-nokia-the-conclusion-lyrics

Got some good in my heart
Got the stars in my eyes
Got some plans for this art
Got some things I wanna say
And some things I hold back
Got some tears I done cried

I been faking since young
I been holding it in

Lemme touch myself
Pass and step back
Kiss myself, c'mon
Get it on, you be screaming my name
Mad I'm getting honey at the foreign exchange
While your man jerking off to my pictures
I'm in meetings round town making boss decisions
Oh, you ain't know let me score this pigeons
I got a rhyme that barks like a dog that hiccups
And a flow that's so hot it can get your dick up
(?)
Cuz' this princess lifestyle is hard to keep up
Wearing Nauti, acting loopy
On my nookie, new Suzuki
Say he sweat the coochie, wanna buy me Gucci
Sport the new Perruci wrapped up in the Pucci
Italian imported like the counter at Balducci
Watch me when I step on carpet , Armaretto
Italian leather, and the Timberland Stiletto
Here they call me princess like I'm Tony Daughta Meadow
A made bitch to these wise guy fellows
Classic to the cello, money green and yellow
Sonny sends his love, and papi says hello
(Chorus)
When I pull up in the spot
(Put your hands up!)
If you talking to me hot
(Bring your stacks up!)

She's so naughty
At the party in Bulgari (x2)
Versace Hottie, Mafioso Mami

God Mother, unlike the others
See these dudes move like feds cuz' they straight undercovers
You a joke and you make me laugh
Claim you gettin money but you get no cash
Claim you bag chicks, but you chicks is trash
Fast to pop shit, now look at your ass
I was Eve with the apple, you a snake in the grass
When it's all said and done , you a ghost to the past
The best that you had, cuz' your new bitch is mad
You try imitate everything that we have
So i move on ,and bore with borders
You outside with change looking for quarters
I'm inside the range, flippin' the focus
On my way to the stage, fixing my Rolex
Here's the stage , pay like a warbuck
And they all know my name, Paris to London
That's why my pay is bigger than yours son
Triple your income, see I know where I fit son
Flirt with the mobs, you don't want no problems
Tie you and wack you when I don't even have to
Cuz' i'm not even mad boo, but I know that you're mad too!

Prior to the magic, I caught you like a magnet
Electricutic tactics, in and out of madness
Now you gotta have it, before I didn't have shit
With youIi dream of lavish, but love is so dramatic
Fight the power dashing trades by the hour
50 for this hour, love for this dollar is

The screams becoming louder, we hop into the shower
 a bed of flowers, disease is called the lala
You scream i'm screaming louder, believe you trying harder
I shriek and say ahaha, I mean whatever yaya
For me it's me and power, yeah, yeah
Fooled you, could've fooled you all these years
Boss ass bitch, no time for the tears
Matter fact get your money up i'm balling
Hold up baby my up the shawty's calling
Back to the future, bring me the galactic
I could take your girl, watch this shit happen
Why you sitting stuck with your dum dum face
