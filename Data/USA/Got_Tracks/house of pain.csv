Jump Around,House of Pain,1992.0,"Pack it up, pack it in, let me begin
I came to win, battle me, that's a sin
I won't ever slack up, punk, you better back up
Try and play the role and yo, the whole crew'll act up
Get up, stand up (C'mon!) c'mon, throw your hands up
If you've got the feeling, jump up, touch the ceiling
Muggs lets the funk flow,
 someone's talking junk
Yo, I bust him in the eye, and then I'll take the punk's ho
Feelin', funkin', amps in the trunk and I got more rhymes
Than there's cops at a Dunkin' Donuts shop
Sho' nuff,
 
I got props
From the kids on the Hill
 plus my mom and my pops
I came to get down, I came to get down
So get out your seat and jump around!

Jump around! (Jump around!)
Jump around! (Jump around!)
Jump around! (Jump around!)
Jump up, jump up and get down!
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! (Everybody jump)
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! (Everybody jump)
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!
Jump!

I'll serve your ass like John McEnroe
If your girl steps up, I'm smacking the ho
Word to your moms, I came to drop bombs
I got more rhymes than the Bible's got Psalms
And just like the Prodigal Son I've returned
Anyone stepping to me, you'll get burned
'Cause I got lyrics, but you ain't got none
If you come to battle, bring your shotgun (Shotgun)
But if you do you're a fool, 'cause I duel to the death
Trying to step to me, you'll take your last breath
I got the skills, come get your fill
'Cause when I shoot the gift, I shoot to kill
I came to get down, I came to get down
So get out your seat and jump around!

Jump around! (Jump around!)
Jump around! (Jump around!)
Jump around! (Jump around!)
Jump up, jump up and get down!
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! (Everybody jump)
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! (Everybody jump)
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!
Jump!

I'm the cream of the crop, I rise to the top
I never eat a pig 'cause a pig is a cop
Or better yet a Terminator, like Arnold Schwarzenegger
Try to play me out like as if my name was Sega
But I ain't going out like no punk bitch
Get used to one style and yo and I might switch
It up, up and around, then buck, buck you down
Put out your head
 
and then you wake up in the Dawn of the Dead
I'm coming to get ya, I'm coming to get ya
Spitting out lyrics, homie, I'll wet ya
I came to get down, I came to get down
So get out your seat and jump around!

Jump around! (Jump around!)
Jump around! (Jump around!)
Jump around! (Jump around!)
Jump up, jump up and get down!
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! (Everybody jump)
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! (Everybody jump)
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! (Everybody jump)
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! (Everybody jump)
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!
Jump!

Yo, this is dedicated to Joe ""The Biter"" Nicolo
Grab the Bozack, punk",https://genius.com/House-of-pain-jump-around-lyrics
I’m a Swing It,Same As It Ever Was,1994.0,"On and just on, and 

I'm a swing it
Watch me bring it to the next level
The grafted devil's
Getting funky like The Neville
Brothers from the Bayou
So why you wanna trip?
Just play the sidelines, kid
And wait for me to slip
Cause I can feel it 'In the Air Tonight'
But yo I'm not Phil Collins
I'm more like Henry Rollins
Cause I ""Search and Destroy""
Every toy with a plot
Trying to get what I got
You might get shot
Hot Damn! I'm a slam you like ONYX
Then teach you how to write a rhyme
Like Hooked on Phonics
Mother Goose ain't got shit on me
Cause I'll get loose at the jam
And wreck the whole party
I make 'em jump and mosh, oh my gosh
Just slamming in the pit
While I'm kicking my shit
They bugging in the aisles
Cause I got mad styles
And ain't a damn thing funny
I get money in piles
Some people thought I died
That's just a rumor though
Others thought I fell off
But now I'm Numero Uno
Dos, not Quatro
Word to Kool Keith
I'm a break up your teeth

When I die (die)
Bury me (me)
Hang my balls from a cherry tree (tree)
Let them get ripe (ripe) then take a bite (bite)
And if they don't taste right
Then don't blame D! (D)

You need to quit swinging
The style that I'm bringing
The funk-knuckled dragon
Who gets on the wagon
I'm not the twelve-stepper
Don't play me like a lever
""My Mic Sounds Nice""
But it's not Salt-N-Pepa

Well it's the man with the plan to get all your skins
The tip on my dick's where the line begins
So hoes form a line
Take off that swine
Strip your ass buck-naked
Let's see if you can take it
Cause I'll make you feel
""Like a Natural Woman""
Cause I keep it coming
I'm the EverlastingFreestyle Assassin
With Soul and my goal
Is to bring a little passion
To your girl's life like the daily soaps
Throw her down on the bed and tie her up with ropes

The Lyrics keep on and just on and
The Lyrics keep on and just on and
The Lyrics keep on and just on and
On and just on and on and just on and 

I'm just another Ranger with the Derry face
Punk motherfuckers beef about my race
You need step back, kid and give me some space
So I can cold-shock the party when I'm rocking the place
Danny Boy's arriving, I stand six five and a half
Don't laugh, kid
The outlaw biker with my bitch hitchhiker
On the 'Highway to Hell'
Cause I never tell

Well it's the funk backbreaker
We ""Heat it Up""  like Jamaica
Don't bring your woman to the party
Cause I'll take her
Hit the deck, cause I'm down with the hooleys
I got a trunk full of funk just like the Groovie Goolies
I'm not the man but I asked you ""Who was he?""
Quik's got the hairdo just like Ruth Buzzi
Running 'round town like you been to jail, son
But you hit the swap meet
To get your hair and your nails done
Get off my sack cause your shit is wack
You diss me and I'm a diss you back",https://genius.com/House-of-pain-im-a-swing-it-lyrics
Top O’ the Morning to Ya,House of Pain,1992.0,"""She won't come, just when you want it..""

Ya see I'm Irish, but I'm not a leprechaun
You wanna fight, then step up and we'll get it on
You'll get a right to the grill, I'm white and I ill
A decendant of Dublin with titanic skill
I ducked and I swing, next thing your jaw's broken
Punk I ain't jokin', you can bet you'll be chokin'
On a fist full of nuttin, 
meanwhile I'll be puffin'
On a fat blunt
, what punk? You don't know the half
Tryin' to talk shit, man, please don't make me laugh
These Irish eyes are smilin',
 I'm buckwhylin'
The House of Pain is pumpin', start jumpin'
Freak it, funk it, 
back seat trunk it
If you can't get with it, you'll wind up sweatin' it
Then you'll get a beatin' just like an egg
It's so hard to run when you got a broken leg
But we can have a run off, the House of Pain'll come off
We got the cake that you're tryin to get a crumb off
The Irish stylee, 
the Celtic jazz
No one has it, just us, that's it
If you try to take it, 
I got a big shillelagh
I don't have dreads cause I shave my head daily
You call me a skinhead, I call you a pin head
Yo, where you been man, 
just like the Tin Man
You got no heart,
 here comes the good part
I pick 'em, buck 'em, cut 'em up, and buck 'em down
No fuckin' around, homeboy ya get clowned like Krusty
Trust me, you shouldn't play.. and by the way

Top o' the mornin to ya.. ""
What's the hassle man?""
Top o' the mornin to ya.. ""What's the hassle man?""
Top o' the mornin to ya.. ""What's the hassle man?""
Top o' the mornin to ya..
""Hey, are you givin us a hassle man?""

Greetings, salutations
Peace to the Nations of Zulu and Islam
Crack a bottle, rev the throttle
Put the gear in, now you're steerin'
Like Mario Andretti, so let me kick it
Cause I can make a wicked noise like a cricket
Rubbin' his legs, my rhymes are like eggs
Allah'll keep layin' em, I'll keep sayin' em
This is the House of Pain, we're far from plain
But we're not fancy, Ron and Nancy
So ""Just Say No,""
 but I say go
Straight to Hell, I kiss and tell
So if you're a ho, all my friends know
What you gotta say? Let's hit the hay
And have no delay, and yo, by the way..


Extra extra, read all about it
How could ya doubt it? Now scream and shout it!
The House of Pain, soon will reign
Over the Hip-Hop scene in white gold and green

I rip shit and backflip like a Jedi
I roll with the groove and I'm smooth and you can bet I
Come correct and get respect when I'm flowin'
Collectin' my dough, I got you're girlfriend hoein
And how do I know that she's sprung?
I know she's sprung cause yo, the D's hung.. like a
Shetland pony, gettin' paid like Sony
So never ever try to play me out like a phony
Cause I can get real thick like a bowl of Malt-O-Meal
And by the way..",https://genius.com/House-of-pain-top-o-the-morning-to-ya-lyrics
Shamrocks and Shenanigans,House of Pain,1992.0,"I kicks the flavor, like Stephen King writes horror
If I was a Jew then I'd light a Menorah
I got rhymes for ya, excuse me, Señora
Are you a whore or are you a lady?
Is it Erica Boyer or Marcia Brady?
Let me know hon, the deed'll get done
Just assume the position, I'll take my rod
And then I'll go fishing, I'll get your river flowing
I'm always in the knowing
When it comes to giving pleasure, I'm every woman's treasure
I came to work your body, so let me do my job
I've never been laid off, my rhyming skill paid off
Cause now I'm making records, now I'm making tapes
Steady busting suckers in bunches like grapes
Making all the papes, scooping up the loot
Putting suckers on the run, pull my gun and then I shoot
I never been a front, I never been a fraud
I got a natural skill, for that I thank the Lord
Cause I feel blessed, I'm casually dressed
I always got my gun but I never wear a vest
I'm quick on the draw like the horse named McGraw
From the cartoon boom shalock lock boom

(boom shalock lock boom) - alright now
(Boom shalock lock boom) - a little louder
(Boom shalock lock boom) - everybody
(Boom shalock lock boom) - alright now

Breaker, breaker, here comes the caper
Straight with the taper, the lyric skyscraper
Hit you like a lyrical murderer
I know ya think I have, but yo
I never heard of ya
Just because you heard of me kid
Fuck around with D, you do the lifetime bid
I'll put you in the dirt, and leave your ass for dead
When it comes to tools, D's the sharpest in the shed
Cause I'm the '55 Cadillac king
It ain't no thing, my Claddagh ring
Will bust you in the grill
I got the skill, you gots to chill
Cause I bring doom
I got the boom shalock lock boom


I rock mad styles, I hop turnstiles
I rock all mics, I last all night
I puff fat blunts, I rock fine stunts
Step up bo, I'll knock out your gold fronts
Everlast, that's my name
My unique rhyme style's my claim to fame
The House Of Pain's the name of my clique
You can't get down, punk? Get off my dick
You make me sick, like Strawberry Quik
Your style is wack, you ain't the mack
So yo step back, get off the crack
And sing a new tune like boom shalock lock boom",https://genius.com/House-of-pain-shamrocks-and-shenanigans-lyrics
Back from the Dead,Same As It Ever Was,1994.0,"Straight out the casket, risin' up
Open up your eyes - can't you see me?
What the fuck is this? Madness, pick up my bones
Erase my name from off the tombstones
Alive and kickin, breathing the air
Call out my name, punk, and I'll be there
No question, my suggestions of the action
Caught smack dab in the middle of the blastin
Messin with me, you're messin with the best
Blaow, you're takin two shots to your chest

Cause I'm back from the dead
Everlast comin back from the dead (back from the dead)
You know I'm back from the dead
And I'll put a freakin' hole in your head
Back from the dead
Back from the dead

You can't disrespect it, I'm the resurrected
Back from the dead just to mess with your head
I'll stress what I said, but I won't repeat it
If you've got a cold starve it, if you've got a fever feed it
And if you can't beat it then what a blow
You might be positive and not even know
I rock the hardcore from the floor to the ceiling
I give sexual healing, I'll get your girl squealin' like a pig
My grave's somethin' you can never dig
I'll rock a mausoleum, back yard or colosseum

Cause I'm back from the dead
Everlast's comin back from the dead (back from the dead)
You know I'm back from the dead
House of Pain's in effect, nuff said

Skip the autopsy cause I never OD'd
I only puff boom kid, I never get ski'd
I don't sniff or shoot up, riff I'll stick my boot up
Your ass quick fast, Everlast don't jive
Just like Pearl Jam 'I'm still Alive'
(Look at all these rumors)
Spreadin like tumors, gossip and lies
Exaggerated reports of my demise
And if you beleived 'em, well then you got gassed
The media deceived 'em just like in the past

Cause I'm, back from the dead
Everlast's comin back from the dead (back from the dead)
You know I'm back from the dead
And I'll put a freakin hole in your head
Back from the dead
Back from the dead

Like Steven Seagal I'm Hard to Kill
Like GG Allin I'm crazy ill
I'll beat you down with my mic, kick your ass with my Nike
Bust you in the eye if you tell another lie
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Thinkin I'm dead you must be smokin' dust
Come see me bust in the flesh it's a must

Cause I'm back from the dead
Everlast comin back from the dead (back from the dead)
You know I'm back from the dead

Back from the dead.. {*repeat to fade*}",https://genius.com/House-of-pain-back-from-the-dead-lyrics
On Point,Same As It Ever Was,1994.0,"Yeah
The House of Pain

I'm sick, demented
I came and represented
I rose from the grave
I had a close shave
The cops tried to lock me down
'Cause the Glock they found
Was stolen
Thats how I'm rollin'
Calvin Klein's no friend of mine
So I don't like Marky
Or the monarchy
Don't 'Start Me Up' like a Rolling Stone
I'll leave ya sulkin' like Macaulay Culkin in 'Home Alone'
So Get a Grip like Steven Tyler
I used to trip with the Divine Styler
Back in the days there were Irish ways
And Irish laws, stand up for The Cause

When it's time to rock a funky joint
I'm on point
When it's time to rock a funky jam
I'm the man (4x)

Well it's the D to the A, double N Y BO
Y? 'Cause I rock shit like Ronnie Dio
It's a Black day of rest quick run get the vest
I'm down with the Hill 'cause I still got the skill
To turn the party out
It's all about the skyscraper
Your girl caught the vapors
So I might videotape her
I make a lot of papers so I don't have to scrape the
Bottom of the barrel
I rock fly apparel
Now I could pull your card
Starting up the Harley Davidson
I got the gun, so the drama, you could save it

Well it's the mad bum Russian
Funky with percussion
From LA to Flushing
I get your girlie blushin'
I'll cut ya' like the butcher
: But it ain't Joe the Biter!
The old rock a loop cause I'm 'Super' like Schneider

When it's time to rock a funky joint
I'm on point
When it's time to rock a funky jam
I'm the man (4x)
:
I'm ill, retarded
So don't get me started
I might lose my cool
Ya lose if we duel
'Cause I can stomp a hole in the soul of a punk
With the rhymes in my head and the beats in my trunk
I got skill kid
And I'm gonna milk it
For all it's worth, I'm gettin' mines on Earth
So step to the next head
Or like Sadat X said:
'He's gone and that's how it's supposed to be'
'Don't Stand So Close to Me' 'cause

When it's time to rock a funky joint
I'm on point
When it's time to rock a funky jam
I'm the man (4x)",https://genius.com/House-of-pain-on-point-lyrics
Irish Pride,The Unreleased EP,1996.0,"High on a hilltop near your home, there stands a dilapidated old mansion
Some say the place is haunted, but you don't believe in such myths
One dark and stormy night, a light appears in the top most window in the tower of the old house
You decide to investigate and you never return

Well, it's the kid who brought the pride of the Irish back
I'm spreadin' phat rhymes like if I was black
You caught a beatin' cause you played the punk role
Mom and Pop watch ya gonna shift from the soul
So I'm gonna take you out
Just like a first date
Watch me violate
Watch me demonstrate
The mad battle skills
To get the bills paid
I'm true to the trade
My blues are worth the pay
But I grab the guitar
Started up pickin' and strummin'
Then I started whistlin' and hummin'
Next came the bass line followed by the drum kick
My name's Everlast honey cause I don't come quick
I last longer than the Coppertop battery
You lack skills kid please drop the flattery
Get off my dilsnick, I spit the bills quick
Rollin' like pecker, you wanna play that though
So don't fuck around and bring your ho
I'll hit that bitch like I was Ridick Bowe
I got my sheleighy, I got my gun
I'm putting heads out daily and I never run
CHORUS (X4)
Everlast is comin', the funk drummers drummin'
Danny Boy's comin' with the Irish style

You better run, hide, Slip'n Slide
But don't fuck around with that Irish pride
The last one died talkin' all that crap
Yo, he couldn't adapt
I pulled him straight off the map
That's how I'm doin' it because y'all be knewin' it
The only needle my arm was tattooin' it
I roll to the show on my iron horse
Take a hoe and let nature take its cause
So fuck The Source cause I don't read it
It's a fashion mag and hip-hop don't need it
And if you're believin' everything you read
Then that bullshit rags fuckin' with your head
CHORUS (X4)

Just like Pearl Jam you know my flows even
I'm scary like King but yo, my name ain't Stephen
Broaden the appeal, I rock fly apparel
I got a bow and arrow, I'll take your bone marrow
Make a knife handle, skin you like tatanka
Then run you down like my name was Larry Csonka
Who used to be a Dolphin down in Miami
Play me too close and I'm pullin' out my jammy
You know I get funky like the Groovy Ghoulies
Why you steppin' to me, tryin' to make some movies
Pass me my scissors, I'm gonna cut the edit
Borrow off my style kid, but you got no credit
I said it, I meant it, I meant what I said
Steppin' up talkin' shit and I'll bite off that head
I got no dreads but I puff boom
Because it lights up my life like Debbie Boone",https://genius.com/House-of-pain-irish-pride-lyrics
Fed Up,Truth Crushed To Earth Shall Rise Again,1996.0,"* corrections for Cockni O'Dire would be appreciated

Those dirty stinkin boys! (hmm.)
They are talk slick, hot like pepper
But what, dem about batty bwoy movement
Man I ain't on dat! (Lord have mercy)
Tell Julius, if he's a man a man ?? ?? (Lord, have mercy)
Can't know send me big up to the two of dem, de dreads
Now look!

I've got demons, runnin through my sleep (UH)
They like to creep when my thoughts get deep
Schemin, tryin to find a place to fit in
And manifest itself in the form of a sin
If I was Rin Tin Tin I'd rip the skin off of Lassie
The shit you talk is idle, threatenin to blast me
You high on gas like a rastaman farted
Don't set it off kid and get me started
Cause you're highly regarded when you're dearly departed
But momma's still cryin, asking God why in the world
Could you take her, only child
When you was frontin on the streets like you was buckwild
To keep it real kid you gots to stay humble
You can't fumble, and if you gots to rumble
Then word to Bryant Gumble I'mma live for today
And God bless the man that steps in my way
Cause if I said it, somebody's gettin wetted
So just keep your cool and everything is copacetic
Pull out your heater, kid spit your razor
And mine'll still be the intellect that plays ya
Cause when the mic check, I'm high-tech, skills are apparent
You can play the child kid, I'll play the parent
Cause I'mma be responsible for your schoolin
But I won't change your diapers, or do your carpoolin

A-get up, I'll break ya down a lil' somethin
I'm fed up, it's time to go headhuntin
Dead up, too many crews be frontin
I'm fed up, it's time to go headhuntin
Get up, I'll break ya down a lil' somethin
I'm fed up, it's time to go headhuntin
Dead up, too many crews be frontin
I'm fed up, it's time to go headhuntin

Oh yes (Lord) unlike E (have mercy)
Tell de dirty pussy dem fi clean up dey ac' (oh my soul)
And trace back (whoa) cause we no hear nah dat (whoa)
Now look!

Now why everybody makin shit that's unreal
Cause the A&R man they wants mass appeal
Forgettin all about how it's 'sposed to feel
Kids be goin out for the record deal
So if you pull out the clap, then bust your cap
Or I'mma make like the ban and drop bomb on your Gap
But don't +Snap+, cause this ain't HBO
Kid you got no Benz, plus you got no dough
Why you say that though? You tryin to game that ho
Used to be you had to rhyme about stuff you know
I don't need MTV to make no buzz
I rock styles that'll make you say ""Ah 'oo dat was?""
And who that was is the man of all hours
Sendin all-star players straight back to the showers
Fake hard rocks are really just cowards
I master dub plates like my name's Herb Powers
I'll getcha open like huntin season
I make papers, don't front on the reason
Cause I'm seizin up every day
You say, carpe diem, I call 'em like I see 'em


To all dem man (?) come in the place going on like they run ting they run raasclart ting
Cos we run that, god knows we run that
Everyone can see we run this ting
Cha, nobody be vex me boy
Me said nobody TEST me boy
Me said nobody stress me boy
Anyone whowanna !!
(Lord, have some mercy
On my soul.. whoa!
Say Lord, please have some mercy
On my soul.. whoa!)

A-get up, I'll break ya down a lil' somethin (I get violent!)
I'm fed up, it's time to go headhuntin (and start whylin)
Dead up, too many crews be frontin (So keep silent)
I'm fed up, it's time to go headhuntin (I'm not jokin!)
Get up, I'll break ya down a lil' somethin (It's not what I'm smokin)
I'm fed up, it's time to go headhuntin (Don'tcha make me choke dem)

Knockin you outta park when me lookin

Just Another Victim,Shamrocks & Shenanigans,1993.0,"Victimized
But you're in bed
Stumble out
And run dead
If it ever paid
To self start
Environment
Make you smart

Just another victim
Just another victim
Just another victim, kid
I heard it once
But not before
Begging off
And livin' bored
My hands are tied
Webbed feet again
Fell in behind
And claim us dead

Cast this
In spite of truth
Give it up
I'll lie to you
Blame and flame this
Turn to start
Pointed finger
You fall apart

You played yourself now you point the finger
How i've robbed and raped ya, bruised and scraped ya
But those are just lies, cause in your eyes you've been victimized
It's how you size it up, you disguise it up, and try to make it look
Real
To cover up the low self esteem you feel
Introspection an afterthought, swimmin in guilt your favorite sport
But now you're caught up in the undertow
You never knew a man could sink so low
But now you know, cause you're 
John Doe
In a black bag a tag on your toe
I built the House
I felt the Pain
You're victimized but got no one to blame
Just another victim
You're just another victim, kid
Just another victim
You're just another victim kid
Holy diver, I'm a survivor
Feeling like DeNiro in Taxi Driver
With Jodi Foster, and Harvy Kietel
Looks like I'm walkin through a livin Hell
So spark that L, and I'll get lifted
Feelin the effects of what my spliff did
Cause I'm gifted, I read 
Sun Tzu
I bought a Gun too so you'll never come too
The weight of the world ridin on my shoulders
Cause I'm a soldier, I thought I told ya",https://genius.com/House-of-pain-just-another-victim-lyrics
Guess Who’s Back,House of Pain,1992.0,"""Guess who's back""

I got the skills to pay the bills
I don't pop pills
But I send chills up your spine when I rhyme
I get wicked, you got a booger, pick it
Sippin' on the forty, ya know it makes me horny
Spread them legs, grab my eggs
Fire up the grill and crack the kegs
Nobody fear, the party's here
Everlast is comin', the funky drummer's drummin'
Ya only came backstage to make the front page
To get me locked up, or get yourself knocked up
But I ain't with it, even if I did it
I got a hundred homeboys to say I didn't hit it
My name's Everlast, I got the funky rhymes
I make more papers than the L.A. Times
I don't do lines, but I puff blunts
I don't rock fronts, but I stuff stunts
Fill 'em to the brim like a cup of coffee
If ya don't know me, homey, back up off me
Cause I ain't soft, see, I'll fly your head
You wind up dead, you made your bed
Now ya gotta lie in it, don't bother tryin' it
Take my advice, homeboy, think twice
Before you step up, step back
Or catch a smack
Guess who's back

(Ease back) Guess who's back (Everybody's in the street) (4x)
(Ease back) (Everybody's in the street) (3x)
(Ease back) (2x)

He's back from the dead, with the shaved head
Don't start to trip, dip, I brought my lead
Just in case you wanna fuck around
I'll stare ya dead in the face, and then I'll buck ya down
I'll put ya six feet deep, some say talk's cheap
But I make big bucks servin' up punk ducks
By the pound, I got the sound
I never been checked, I only get wrecked
I kick the willy drag, let my pants sag
Don't give up the booty, cause I ain't no fag
Check it out, check it, I'm prone to wreck shit
If ya dig this joint, check the next shit
I'm Everlast and it's a natural fact
That the white man is back

(Ease back) Guess who's back (Everybody's in the street) (4x)
(Ease back) (Everybody's in the street) (3x)
(Ease back) (2x)

I'll eat you up like some butter cups from Reese's
I come in peace, but you'll leave in pieces
That's how I'm livin', that's how it goes
Everyday I'm sleepin', every night I'm doin' shows
Always gettin' hoes when there's hoes to get got
Always wear my hat so I never need a shot
Always drink a beer before I write a rhyme
And if I have to drive I avoid the one time
Stay between the lines and I won't get pulled over
I don't need luck cause I got a four-leaf clover
Yea I'm Irish, word to the motherland
But on the otherhand
I love America, apple pie, mom and all that
My pockets stay phat, step the fuck back
Play me close and you catch a mean dose
Of my fist, homeboy you get dissed

(Ease back) Guess who's back (Everybody's in the street) (4x)
(Ease back) (Everybody's in the street) (3x)

Runnin’ Up on Ya,Same As It Ever Was,1994.0,"Runnin' up on ya
The House of Pain...runnin' up on ya
The House of Pain...The House of Pain
Give me some elbow room
Spark the boom
And pass it
I'll drop ya like acid
Ya might get blasted
If ya step to the crew with the Irish Pride
Ya wish ya died
'Cause I don't let shit slide
Sinn Féin
It's the House of Pain
Our day will come
Boom shalock lock
My shit's cocked
Ya better run
Get a gun
Get a bomb
It's on like Vietnam
Then run and get ya mom
And ask why Daddy's buggin'
Chuggin' Black & Tan's
Smacking Fan
I'm breakin' up the set
I'm gettin' bitches wet
Gettin' all the dough
I'm leavin' with ya ho
And if the ho's your wife
Yo, ya might lose your life
'Cause I'm runnin' up on ya
I ain't gonna' warn ya when
I'm runnin' up on ya
I ain't gonna' warn ya
I'm runnin' up on ya
I ain't gonna warn ya when
I'm runnin' up on ya
I ain't gonna' warn ya
I'll rip out ya veins
With hooks and chains
Just like Pinhead
I used to rock a skinhead
Now I got a fade
'Cause I'm paid
And the bomb is played
Everybody's done it
So Ev can never run it
I started that shit two years ago
Your girl started lookin' good five beers ago
So I might step to her
But I just wanna screw her
I don't want to take her
I just wanna make her
Scream out my name
Cause the Pain's in the House
Bust a nut in her gut
And leave a stain in her blouse
Then pull up my drawers
And she's all yours again
And if ya got a beef punk
Better bring a friend
'Cause I'm runnin' up on ya
I ain't gonna' warn ya when
Yo, I'm runnin' up on ya
I ain't gonna' warn ya
'Cause I'm runnin' up on ya
I ain't gonna warn ya when
I'm runnin' up on ya
I ain't gonna' warn ya
I'm comin' 'round the corner
I ain't gonna' warn ya
I'm runnin' up on ya
Punk you're a goner
Put the gun away
Run away
Better chill
Better yet still
Let me get ill
I can drop a bomb
Full of semen in ya mom
And keep her screamin' till dawn
Cause the E can rock on like a
One, two, and ya don't stop
Ya might get dropped
'Cause I don't care
And I swear
I don't have a gun
I ain't gonna warn ya when
'Cause I'm runnin' up on ya

Who’s the Man?,Same As It Ever Was,1994.0,"I used to kick it with the thugs, pushin' drugs in the park
Vic'n
 every mark that was out after dark
Stick 'em for their loot, cut em up then I'd dash
And when I had to shoot, I'd nutted up for the cash
Ran down the block with my 45 Glock
Capped off a round, everybody hit the ground
The next thing I heard was a siren
Couldn't turn around, money grip kept firin'
Runnin' for the ride, I can't go inside
I'd rather that I died, I got too much pride
I guess it's just somethin' that you can't understand
My gun's in my hand, tell me who's the man?

Who's the man with the master plan?
Who's the man? Who's the man?
Who's the man with the master plan?
Who's the man? Who's the man?
Who's the man with the master plan?
Who's the man? Who's the man?
Who's the man with the master plan?
Who's the man? Who's the man?

I used to sell yayo back in the day-o
Ran with the gang, had all the homies slang
Grams to the quarters, I'm takin' all the orders
Makin' all the runs
, 
Rakin' in the funds
I always got my gun, it's the old six-shooter
King of the neighborhood, crazy white peckerwood
People thinkin' Danny lost his mind
It must've been from all the wine man and all the hard times
Like chillin' in the park in the dark with the crew
I'm always gettin' high, I saw my man die
Now I got the work and the dough, 
25 grand and the 5 keys of blow
I gotta' relocate and start all over
But watch it blow up like a supernova
I keep my game air tight and follow the plan
My gun's in my hand, tell me who's the man?

Who's the man with the master plan?
Who's the man? Who's the man?
Who's the man with the master plan?
Who's the man? Who's the man?
Who's the man with the master plan?
Who's the man? Who's the man?
Who's the man with the master plan?
Who's the man? Who's the man?

I got myself locked down in the pen
I ain't got a friend, so here I go again
I gotta' get my props up and earn my respect
Gotta' shake someone up or throw 'em off the top deck
My time's runnin' out, I gotta' spill some blood
If I don't do it quick, shit, my name'll be mud
So I pick out a hard rock and rush him in his cell
Beat his ass down and then say that he fell
And if I gotta' do him, screw him, the convict's dead
I'll stab him in the chest just to let the rest
Of the cell block know that I'm nobody's ho
My shanks in my hand so tell me who's the man?

Who's the man with the master plan?
Who's the man? Who's the man?
Who's the man with the master plan?
Who's the man? Who's the man?

Just call it in one time for me real heavy

Back in black
Who's the mack
Sittin' on the back
Of a Cadillac

Well it's the D motherfucker
Better pass me the mic
So I can rock on
And drop the styles I write
I like hip-hop
Ya don't stop
And all that
I rock the freak styles
And neat styles
That are crazy fat
It's making me sick
Punk get off my dick
Chorus
Cause I'm the same motherfucker
That I ever was
Same motherfucker
But I can't pay attention
Cause I'm on that dust

My head's not swell
Kid I'm not sell
Don't feed me soup
Just give me the funky loop
I'll rock it to the best of my ability
Runnin' mad styles and showin' flexibility
Cause I'm the man that's On Point
When I jam a funky joint
I want some other over there
Yo, I just don't care shit
Pass the mic
Then I'm gonna' tear shit
Up like a peice of paper
Your girl caught the vapor
When I ran the caper
I ain't rearranged
So don't look strange
I'm the same motherfucker
Ain't a damn thing changed
Chorus

Cause I'm hard like stone
Don't play me soft
And I rock rhymes frequently
I drop it off and
I'm off in space
I remember your face
But don't remember your name
Cause it's all the same
As it ever was
That's what it is money grip
Don't trip
Or I'm gonna' bust that lip
Chorus

Bust it, flip it, skip it
Just like a stone on a river
Ya know I'm gonna' give her
Whole lotta' flavor
Criminal behavior
Used to be how I made it
But that shit's over rated
Now I rock rhymes over funky beats
I fuck fine hookers between satin sheets
They say money changes people
But I won't cause
I'm the same motherfucker that I ever was

And ya don't quit
Cause I'm on that dust

Legend,Legend,1994.0,"I walk through the Valley of Death 600 deep
Waking up dead from the sleep
Just like a diamond watch me shine
Bright like the sun
Make you want to pull a gun
And buck two shots for the Peckerwood rocking
Put down your Glock for your block
I'll be knocking dead off your shoulders, heads'll roll
The Peckerwood P-funk assassin of soul
Is in control, so have no fear
I'm in this for real, make it crystal clear
I get a little better each and every year
It's called improvement, your style’s bowel movement
I'm taking you back to Malcolm McLaren
My whole family stole but there ain't one Sharon
So whatcha looking at, huh, why you staring?
Just take a picture before I have to hit ya
Ease back kid, give me some space or
""Whoomp (There It Is!)"" upside your face!

Cause a hero ain't nothing but a sandwich
And a legend ain't nothing but a car
So shoot dope in your veins and get some fame
And maybe one day you'll be a star
You know a hero ain't nothing but a sandwich
And a legend ain't nothing but a car
So go blow out your brains to get some fame
And maybe one day you'll be a star

I live in a house and it's full of pain
But still I refrain from going insane
I stay ""On Point"" like a sniper
Chilling at the Viper Room before it became a tomb
Take the low road and you hit rock bottom and keep low riding
All the way to Sodom and back to Gomorrah
Now your senora is a pillar of salt and it's all your fault
Get your S&M downtown at The Vault
Dirty little fuck-up raising hell
But next year we'll all talk about how you fell
Cause you're judged on how your records sell

A hero ain't nothing but a sandwich
And a legend ain't nothing but a car
So get locked up in chains to get some fame
And maybe one day you'll be a star
A hero ain't nothing but a sandwich
And a legend ain't nothing but a car
So go blow out your brains to get some fame
And maybe one day you'll be a star
Maybe one day you'll be a star
Maybe one day you'll be a star

Let's break it down to the bare root essence
Count your fingers, then count your blessings
True confessions, ask the questions
Substitute your answers with your obsessions
I take it to the break of dawn at times
I do it all the time
But yo, it don't come easy
Cause I turn on the TV
And see more and more pain and less and less glory
And it's the same old story
You see year after year, the programs fear
But I ain't subscribing till there's live executions
On pay-per-view
Word to Donahue put on Melrose Place
""Whoomp (There It Is!)"" upside your face!

A hero ain't nothing but a sandwich
And a legend ain't nothing but a car
So shoot dope in your veins to get that fame
Then maybe one day you'll be a star
A hero ain't nothing but a sandwich
And a legend ain't nothing but a car
So go blow out your brains like Kurt Cobain
And maybe one day you'll be a star
Maybe one day you'll be a star
Maybe one day you'll be a star",https://genius.com/House-of-pain-legend-lyrics

One For the Road,House of Pain,1992.0,"Huh!  Check it out!  Everybody in the house, check it out!
The House Of Pain is in full effect

Call me the corn fed, peckerwood, redneck cracker
White bread, shit kickin' Irish beat jacker
Comin' with the style of a Celtic rebel
Those who ain't on my level call me 
the blue eyed devil
But that's just because they don't know what I know
And that's just because they can't flow like I flow
I rip shit, dip shit, so what you gotta say
Why you wanna play, I fuck you up with no delay
And knock your motherfuckin' fronts out
Smoke my philly blunts out, my buddha never runs out
I turn the little stunts out
And I got the hookers callin' me pops
Once their cherry pops, Everlast gets all the props
I'm hittin' skins from here to Copenhagen
I bed their wenches cause you know I'm a pagan
The House Of Pain, that's the name of my crew
You don't like it, tough luck, what the fuck you gonna do?
Nothin', you ain't sayin' nothin'
You need to start puffin' and relax
Or you'll wind up gettin' taxed
For your money, for your jewels, for your car, for your ho
My crew, they start trippin' while I'm rippin' up the show

Mickey Mouse, you know he's in the house
I said Mickey Mouse, you know he's in the house

One for the road, this is one for the road
For my man Matt Champy, this is one for the road
Tura lura lura, tura lura li
Tura lura lura, that's an Irish lullaby
No need to act fly, you'll be sayin' nighty-night
The place you're in is right if you're lookin' for a fight
Step up, your blood, I spill it
Put on the beat, I kill it
I'll burn ya like some bacon that's been fryin' in my skillet
Move over

And I score points with the joints that I throw
Cause I flow daily, I'm no punk, see
I break backs, make tracks and get funky
There's no one to run to cause nobody cares
MC's drop to your knees, say your prayers
The luck of the Irish is about to kick in
Prepare to die and notify your next of kin
I'm going all out, buck, duck and call out
That's how I'm living, punk you better stall out

To come inside is insane

I'll put your head out (4x)
Jump up spread out
I'll put your head out
I'll put your head out
Put put your head out
Jump up spread out
I'll put your head out
Hey what up punk?
I'll put your head out

Who steps to booz?
When the hoods wanna take a cruise
They're feeling effects of the booze
Ain't no clues, to hell with them fools
Who got smoked even though they strap tools
They got brews but I got the boomer
Trigger to blast you and skip the bull
Take my life shit, I'll take you to school
In a duel, what's the difference if you think you're dropping jewels?
Carbon copy, think you're so cool
Stop dreaming and hallucinating
You're caught up in a piece I'm painting
Click click, punk, now you're thinking ""Oh shit!""
Quit while you're ahead before I fill you full of lead


Blessed with the gift, and gets with the rhyme
I never say quit when I'm out to get mine
It's live and let die, sit back and get high
Smoking a fat blunt, waiting for some punk
To act up like he's got something in him
Then I grab the mic and start spitting out venom
Carving up headstones, blowing out headphones
Stepping to me, you'll wind up in the Dead Zone
It's nothing personal, that's how it goes, G
Step up with beef and you'll wind up losing teeth
Cause I don't give up the mic that easy
Step back, this ain't government cheese, G
You can stand in line, but you ain't getting it

Treat ya like a gas tank, take your ass and fill it

They'll have your body droppin'

Meanwhile I'll be snatchin'
Up your hoes and all your dough

The styles that I'll be kickin'
You know they're finger lickin'
Good, the peckerwood never could play the victim
Only the offender
I go out on a bender
Drink a case of brew
And then disgrace a crew
But only if it's Mickey's
I never wear no Dickies
Only wear the Levi's
My whole family cries",https://genius.com/House-of-pain-house-of-pain-anthem-lyrics
It Ain’t a Crime,Same As It Ever Was,1994.0,"Johnny was a bad boy, he was juvenile delinquent
He had his picture on the wall of every precinct
He had a rep of hanging out with his homies
Puffin on the blunts and sippin on the forties
But when he spoke, nobody would listen
And when he was home, yo, his parents they would diss him
They called him a bum a worthless piece of shit, so over this he had a fit
And now he grabs his bag and heads for the door
And walks to the neighborhood liquor store
Pulls out a gun tells the old man ""Hit the floor!""
Then breaks open the register drawer
Pulls out the money stuffs it in his pocket
Points his pistol then he starts to cock it
The man panics and gun goes off
Stupid old fool made Johnny blow his head off
But he don't care cause Johnny was thought
It ain't a crime if you don't get caught

It ain't a crime if you don't get caught
It ain't a crime if you don't get caught
It ain't a crime if you don't get caught
That's how it is homie, like it or not

Now coming out the store, Johnny shot two Hasidic Jews
And when he got home his face was on the news
His mom freaked out, told him get the fuck out
That when the pigs rolled up, so yo he ducked out
He hit the backdoor like his name was Carl Lewis
Dipped to the payphone to find out where his crew is
He called up his homeboy Jose, ""What up!""
""Can I come over my man?"", he said, ""No way
A cop was here he was looking all over for ya
But I told the pig I didn't know ya""
He said, ""Cool meet me up at the school
I need a ride cause I'm wanted for homicide""
Johnny's got a gun and he's on the run
But he don't care, to him the shit's fun
Now that he's an outlaw sorta like Robin Hood
The hard rock hero of the whole neighborhood
If they catch him he'll wind up in court
But it ain't a crime if you don't get caught

It ain't a crime if you don't get caught
It ain't a crime if you don't get caught
It ain't a crime if you don't get caught
That's how it is homie, like it or not

It ain't a crime if you don't get caught
It ain't a sale if it don't get bought
It ain't a show if I don't get paid
She ain't a ho if you don't get laid",https://genius.com/House-of-pain-it-aint-a-crime-lyrics
Womb To The Tomb,The Unreleased EP,1996.0,"CHORUS:
From the womb to the tomb

From the earth to the moon

And from the sea to the sky

And from the brain through the eye

From the celtic tribes, and the highland plains
I hit you with the quickness, like bad brains
I ain't blowin' no spikes, no queers, no dykes
Just the pale-faced cracker in the high-top nikes
Dope bustin' mics, I smoke cannibus
And if it's God's day off, in the cig I trust
You don't think I bust, you don't know my style I got kids that'll hit ya on the low-profile
I've been from 248, out to east New York
My earth don't wear swine
I don't eat pork From no rusty fork, or no silver spoon
Put down your silver platter, kid, come check the data
My crew's chalk full of free information
It's ji`had, 
Mecca be the destination
Glory be to God one more prostration
The root and foundation of civilization
CHORUS

Makin' shit happen, transition to casual moods
I'm livin' revelations, for real spiracle
I unroll the mythical chronic, keep an airborne stash
To make Divine's stein shine in this killah rhyme clash
Now seven false gods, (c'mon) step through the temple
Loose joints tremble, a brother said I resemble
The teachings of Jesus they sat down and said teach us
The illest earthly dreams of drama homicide schemes
I said brother mind want cream, but brothers i see green
Of a once warm flesh to arrest their peace
Never release your finger piece to go up in you with no crease
Then a priest overcame one sunlight, and beamed
And blessed on the DNA legacy in me
CHORUS

My teacher teaches the wickedness, out of my swiftness
My mental be kickin' the shit out my physical
Ridiculous duels, and ridiculous deals
Make a brother want to clot some chrome inch steel
My finger on the trigger a destiny for real
I sit in purgatory tryin' to break seven seals
Nine hells deep I see nine of me creep
But divine of me seek to put nine of me to sleep
I exhaust my existence, the pain is persistent
My mind got the quickness, I'm on my own hit-list
I head to gates of warped states and parralellistics
Now if knowledge is the essence of every man
Link him up with his wisdom so they understand
No matter, who ya be set your culture free
Cause' its the final hour time to refine your power
We're all equal, livin' man is God
You can't destroy what I build, cause i'm all of me killed
That's my cypher, my atom is a sphere and a square
Cause I'm here and I'm there from the sea to the air
CHORUS

All praise is due to Allah, the most gracious
The most merciful, the most benevolent
Master of the Day of Judgment, keep us all well

Shut the Door,Truth Crushed To Earth Shall Rise Again,1996.0,"(Verse 1: Everlast)
Baby, bounce to my rhythm, I be radiating static
With toys in my attic, style's automatic
I love 'em Asiatic, Japanese and Puerto Rican
Every time I start speaking, I wind up freaking on
Some little floozy naked in my Jacuzzi
If you think I'm not choosy than the joke's on you
You want the 411, baby, here's my style
I like 'em young but I'm no freaking pedophile
I'm known to set it wild, young girls get creamy
Swing 'em through the morn and the Ev will get steamy
You can't see me, I play the set low
Scraping on the bottom, smoking L's if I got 'em
And I ain't too proud to beg for your leg
Let me push up in the thighs and fertilize your egg
Let me make your nature rise along with your blood pressure
Strip you down bare, lay your things on the dresser
While the children of the lesser God play the hard rock role
Girl, I stay rock hard
Hook (2)
So if I get mine, you'll get yours
And we can take it to the wild side behind closed doors
Rip off your stockings and drop your drawers
We can take it to the wild side behind closed doors
(Verse 2: Divine Styler)
You couldn't meet me, half on half with that cream you stash
So baby i burn my desire for that ass
Its so hard for a brother to pass, you're so crush
I be thinking how her legs curve, get the thrust
Get the thrust, but once I big up
I'mma stick up the seam
(Cockni o Dire:)
Comin in comin comin ya betta stoppa there
(Divine Styler)
Enough of this give 'em shit, baby let's beam
Word to earth, check the scheme
I got the flavor mad sabretooth mad soul
Don't act, front or style just blaze on back
Come fix Divine Style, connect summer child
I knows it's Pop Dukes I got the means to protect
And shelter my roots, God-proof master
Allah - Divine loot has to motivate the rapture
To my hot butter mate, feel my hot dubplate
C'mon baby, ease on back uh!
Hook (2)
(Verse 3: Cokni O'Dire)
How do you feel, someone is real
Magnet to steel, chant chop in your libido
Know what I mean
Who man you feen
To have between your piece and (??)
Mind on your flex, latex your sex
Never complex, nobadda bust a def
You know the deal and you a betta kneel
Magnet to steel
Baby-uh
(Verse 4: Everlast)
Ah baby, can't you feel it, deep down inside ya
I can't hide the fact I wanna ride ya
Body up and down and then back and forth
Kind of like Aaliyah, girl, I wanna see ya
Oh, you look good, honey bun, I can't fake it
And word is bond I just got to get you naked
And once you're naked I'm a lick your skin
Then touch you in spots that ain't nobody else been
I'll kiss you down there when you're bare
And I swear that I'll do it right
I'll make it last all night
But don't put up a fight cause I ain't Macho Man Randy
I'm not a Savage, I just want some candy
And it's, fine and dandy if you need some time
But let me know whatcha think and, sugar, ease my mind
Let me know where I stand, come take my hand
Give me a hug, then lay me down on the rug

To disrupt the jinn in me, cause the sin in me's
Tryin' to take over and make my soul crossover

Cause my system pumps loud, everybody's on my nuts
And everybody wants to know who lives the phattest
The black 850 representin' my status
Plus, I got the baddest, house on the hill (shit!)
My bank account's full, but my soul's empty still

Heart Full of Sorrow,Truth Crushed To Earth Shall Rise Again,1996.0,"If I was to sit down and actually write out a list
Of the MC's that missed it would be the constitution
They play their caps backwards, still saying wack words
No power to Durhust, just a few yes-men
Raising the question of who gave you a contract?
They should be fired, you're officially retired

I see you make a little cash and start showing your ass
You get laced up with jewels, your crews acting like fools
Playing hard rock surrounded by bodyguards
Hoping no one pulls your card, you got me laughing pretty hard
Thinking you the white-hot man of the hour
But you just can't figure how your flavor went sour
Back in '89 PE fought the power
And in' 86 Big Daddy Kane was raw!

And I was right there on the first floor of the Palladium
You never played a venue, local college or a stadium
A young boy's pen and pad fad is now a grown man's profession
To earn this is a blessing, these skills have me guessing
Learn cause I'm testing, follow this down no question

No doubt, check it out
You be either rhyming in code or on some gangster node
You all clockwork apocalypse you about to implode
Collapsing on yourself cause your whole foundation is
Built on lies, don't apologize
Cause once they watch you rise they wanna watch you fall
And they'll all take a piece just like the Berlin wall
And place it on their mantle like a souvenir
And what they call a knick-knack is really your career

You ain't promise nothing but a pocket full of stress
Still there be people that would die for less
You ain't promise nothing but a heart full of sorrow
If they don't like the demo make a new one tomorrow
You ain't promise nothing but a pocket full of stress
Still there be people that would die for less
You ain't promise nothing but a heart full of sorrow
If they don't like the demo make a new one tomorrow

When it's time to rise I'll open the archives
When you be in dreams you got 8's and 5's
Chrome down with the leather package
You got a home of your own
You're holding acres (I got it made)
Season tickets to the Knickers and the Lakers
Playing both coasts closed and European festivals
Crowd scream decibels
Crowd scream decibels in your ear
You wanna make rapping your career?

From Arkansas to Minnesota I sell out the quota
I be the wet dream making cream for promoters
We keep the shit right we don't be starting no fights
And he won't hold out my dough cause I'mma put out his lights
And once the crew hits the stage the crowd gets involved
We show love, they show it back, all problems solved
You can boom-shalak and jump to the sounds I pump
But I ain't quitting till I'm shitting on Donald Trump!
Verse 7: Divine Styler
So take heed to the verses and styles and versions
When you socialize with other MC's
And boast your rhymes to company enemies
And in any cases that feel is what you want
Flam and flow with your crew and then select ya floss
You want to make money money and take every honey
Rap charges ain't funny but it boost your career
Your penile style is now hanging from a tier
Now you wanna know fear to impress your peers
Now your ass outta here, the rap game goes on..",https://genius.com/House-of-pain-heart-full-of-sorrow-lyrics

Over and over, and three times a lady
She said peep the scene at the end I ain't Shady
But, you and me is hush-hush, the word be mum
If you keep the low pro' I'll still give you some
Cause, I got a man and he pays my bills
He keeps my wares real fly and hooks my hair and nails
But baby don't sweat it, baby keep calm
Baby don't worry I'll be Viet Cong
I can run three days off a bowl of rice
And a piece of fish, I'll grant your every wish, so

To the thirty-third degree, you know that's me

Now gimme some room, and I'll explode

I came to rip shit
Blastin' with the Soul Assassins
Askin' the question, teachin' the lesson
Bringin' the West Coast back to the East Coast
Where it all started, what're you, retarded
You're startin' to trip from that Jheri curl drip
Soakin' in your brain, the House Of Pain
Is causin' pain, and feelin' pain
So feel it

Just feel it
Feel it
Just feel it
C'mon y'all, feel it

Back to the rhyme, I'm always on time
A lime to a lemon, yo, a lemon to a lime
I rock the old school style and it's futile
To step up, cause you'll get swept up
Like dust, or I just might bust and unload my clip
Unless you're a punk, then I'll just pop you in the lip
And show you the deal, now how did that feel
You know I'm killin' any pig that squeels
I'm fillin' up reels of tape with my fly rhymes
And I've got a subsciption to High Times
Son Doobie's in the back, the Mexican Ralph M is on the track
My DJ Lethal, he's on the cut
When I bust a dope rhyme, it's like bustin' a nut
So let me jerk off on the mic and get it sticky
When I drink a brew it's either Guiness or mickeys
I'll put your head out just like a fuckin' Malboro
Don't fuck with me, punk, you know that I'm thorough
Bred like a race horse, right-in-your-face force
Feedin' you beats, straight off the streets
So catch me catch me, if you can
You know I'm the man like Chewbacca knows Han
Solo, bolos are what I'll be throwin'
When I be flowin', I get the job done
Cause I'm number one, the Prodigal Son
I left and I came back, but not with the same rap
And not with the same style, I'm known to get buckwild
The luck of the Irish spreads like a virus
So feel it

Just feel it
Feel it
Just feel it
C'mon y'all, feel it",https://genius.com/House-of-pain-feel-it-lyrics
Earthquake,Truth Crushed To Earth Shall Rise Again,1996.0,"I be breaking the laws, breaking the laws
All you wannabe hard rocks just pause
It's the MC host Space ghost from the coast
With pinkish white skin
Kid, where you been?
I got a blue eye but my title ain't devil
I freak harmonies like my brothers was Neville
And I could rock a three day old style
Eating cold crawdad stew
So whatcha wanna do?
I'm coming real soon to a theater near you
So why don't you critique me while I'm live on stage?
Cause I'm gonna break my - rusty cage, my rusty cage
Watch the way I freak it when I bust my gauge
Cause all that loud gun talk, it don't mean squat
If my tool ges hot, I'm a burst your knot
And give it all I got up in your wisdom slot
And Cutty Ranks couldn't stop her
From calling me poppa
Big daddy jaw-dropper, Mr. Heartbreaker
She leaves Mary Poppins but she comes home Seka
Chorus
Yes yes y'all
Cause I'm so fly (so fly)
Everlast be the apple of your Earth's eye
Yes yes y'all
Cause we dont fake (don't fake)
And he's down to come to feel your earthquake

Socialize a little something and you sweating my style
Challenge your world and check the shell I'm in
You wanna sit with my flesh and recognize the test?
You never seen this niggas best
So mesmerize your nest
I hit your head with styles that are liquid
You drip this, sweat this
Perspired is desired, this wetness
You get from Divine Style, spark this girl, chill
I see you got the love, the lust
So why don't you live my cosmos exodus
And to my precious I'mma undress my message
Into my wisdom body to my wisdom method
You need a star for your crescent
I God-ed the alphabets
For your atmosphere my-a dope mathematics
Will soak you like Insincere
Uh, baby, for my apparatus
I do the justice to your physical, anoint your aider
Never spending your nobler, a hard style at stages
While the guard be sparking that indo seed
The Earth pieces be increasing the need to be pleased
I represent the illest villains and the worst of bad breeds
Ah baby, if you wanna annexe my vision
You better come with subject of vision
I keep it real live, keep it real straight
To the Earthly, feel these styled Earthquakes
Chorus (x 2)
(I said baby be calm, baby don't cry
Divine Styler: Its the soul (?) the universe is on time) (X2)

My love's stronger than pride
My love's thicker than blood
My killer squad's in effect
Nobody's living off HUD
If your missile's a scud
I'll run a patriot gig
I'll have you flipping your wig
I'll put the clip in my SIG
And cock the hammer back (Click-Clack)
Put a hole in your back
The size of a plum, you can come get some
But my attitude shitty like G. Gordon Liddy
Take pity on a child that's been raised in the city

Chill from East to West
To maintain my rep
So many times y'all assume my flow
I go mono, stereo or solo
You never know, choose a flow
And I'll throw the phattest at 'em
I'm so hot, and so law and so far from the plan
I reflectulate this drama for the ladies that be scanning
My composition de-circular
Hurting the mad opposition

Where I’m From,Same As It Ever Was,1994.0,"That's where I'm from
That's where I'm from

Back in the hut we used to drop mad L
Contemplating hell
The stories I could tell would
Freak your mind
And wreck your brain
The thoughts I would have
Would drive most insane
Divine playin' Rain
Gettin' Down wit' 
Jimi
Hendrix and Page
Big up to Rage
But back to the hut in
Bilal's
 
backyard
Me and D was starvin'
And times were hard
Danny used to roll through
Schemin' on the hustle
Credit cards and slanging
And MC bangin'
Lethal used to come with his 
reel to reel
We didn't have no deal
But that wasn't the point, we'd...
Rock a funky joint
Then we'd rock another
The only thing to eat
Was some bread and peanut butter
So big up to all the females that fed me
In case you ever wondered
Did he forget me
?
These are the times that I always think of
And this is dedicated to the ones I love

Paintin' on the wall
Ten years gone by
Playin' on the stereo
With the volume kinda up
Scheme Team
's comin'
Bring me along
We gonna throw a hut party
Till' the break of dawn
With the Soul prophets of Soul Poetry
Chameleon, Kalonjee, Divine and Cockni
Bring a tab and a 40 and a bag of weed
That's all I need G
Cause I ain't greedy
Trippin' for days
Runnin' the maze
Goin' down to Venice
Sippin' on the Guinness

Now times have changed
I'm out on tour
And I don't see my friends every day no more
And 'cause they don't see me
They think I've changed
But I'm the same motherfucker, no doubt
What's that all about
I thought we was people
I'm tryin' to get mine
I thought you had my back
Man, I can't understand
They used to slap my hand
Ask me for a grand
And run wit' your man
Behind my back and diss me
If you wanna fuck me
First ya gotta kiss me

Battle me, that's a sin

Punk you better back up
Try and play the role and yo the whole crew will act up
Get up, stand up 
Come on, throw your hands up
If you've got the feeling
Jump up touch the ceiling
Muggs lifts a funk flow
Someone's talking junk, yo
I'll bust him in the eye
And then I'll take the punk's hoe
Feelin', funkin'
Amps in the trunk, and
I got more rhymes than there's cops at a Dunkin' Donuts shop
Sho' 'nuff I got props from the kids on the hill
Plus my mom and my pops
I came to get down
I came to get down
So get out your seat and jump around
Jump around, jump around, jump around
Jump up, jump up and get down
Jump, jump, jump (everybody jump)
Jump, jump, jump, jump

If your girl steps up, I'm smacking the hoe
Word to your moms
I came to drop bombs
I got more rhymes than the Bible's got Psalms
And just like the Prodigal Son, I've returned
Anyone stepping on me - you'll get burned
Cause I got lyrics but you ain't got none
If you come to battle bring a shotgun 
But if you do you're a fool, cause I duel to the death
Tryin' to step to me - you'll take your last breath

Tryin' to play me out as if my name was Sega
But I ain't going out like no punk bitch
Get used to one style and you know I might switch
It up up and around, then buck buck get down
Put out your head then you wake up in the Dawn Of The Dead

The girls on them TVs

I still dress the same
So it must be my name

With who's real and who's not
Who treated me the same

They said I couldn't eat too
So I put my cake down

Everybody look what's goin' down
I'm everlastin', forever on a roll
I'm rockin' to the boat, steamin' grey matter tone
I ain't sayin' I'm God, but you can graft this
Chances are if I'm a star I'd be Johnny Mathis
On some smooth shit, I'd be gamin' all the honeys
Hittin' Hugh Hefner with his Playboy bunnies
Check the Sunday funnies, I be readin' Doonesbury
See me after dark, love, shit be gettin' scary
I'll freak you like Carrie on the night of the prom
Let's keep it cool and calm, I'll start strokin' your palm
Work my way up your arm, start kissin' your ear
Maybe lickin' your lips, then pullin' your hair
Yeah, I'll freak the back spasm, then give the orgasm
And if my legs cramp, girl, I'll lick that stank
I got it sewn love, so you ain't got no worries

Stop, hey, what's that smell

Too much of this dope need growth-type slow
Off a poet's tree, let me blow my leaves
Shake off my roots and pull up my sleeves
Break a branchling wist stick
Lyrics for the mystical
Yo fancy, shake your chassis
Our transystem is torn MCs
I hymn-zen, then I'm casualies
Pot smoke-seeds, relativities
Seize it, I be on every first ability
Of chaos, a higher form of infinity
Gettin' me virtually supreme ID
Reflectors and tackers
At which my faster phrased words
Super-lax, break raps and MCs jump off wacks
Revolves and steers and still sees time stilt
I work for Real Bill Divine, it's lyrical chill
I say, ""Stop"", hey, what's that smell?
Someone laced dust all up in my L
Bitches start sweatin' when the pockets swell

I drop the boom-batta like 
Jake LaMotta
I can single you out and isolate ya like Mono
I'm undefeated like

Some do the math
Some stick to the road
Some stray from the path

Money, what's the beef
It's goin down rough like swallowing teeth
I say word to Thin Lizzy, kid I get busy
And I'll knock all of y'all off this Wonderwall
Cause on a daily basis I rock like Oasis
Bit the Beatles style
 from a fetus to a child
I kill fourteen billion cells puffing L's
Stomping devils on all nine levels of Hell
Check the transmission, hear the transition
Observe the technician in finite vision
Your highlight reels are laced by drug deals
As you scheme to check feels on chicks in high heels
It's all bright and sunny when you're holding big money
Buy my Sonics got Youth plus my Mud got Honey
I can be the King of Grunge if I blows my sponge away
""There's a little black spot on the sun today""
Which I don't care if my soul's up there
So come on and feel the Sting from the true ""Pain King!""

Cause I can rock it all kinds of live ways
Like my man Dennis Miller does it on Fridays
I get closer than the Nine Inch Nails
I'm the opposite of the definition of stale
I'm fresher than the lettuce in your produce section
If you come to get us, better bring protection
I could rock a Texan, I could rock an Asian
I could rock the spectrum from black to Caucasian
 (x4)
It's the same old, same old, blasé-blah
Sipping on the forty and puffing La

I got the soundbite that'll get you uptight
You wanna dis then there might be a fist fight
I measure ten on the Richter scale
So call me 
Moby Dick
 and watch the great white whale
You could play the Ishmael but you're doomed to fail
And if you didn't know you better read the tale
Cause I get mail every time I play
And I can take it up town J-Disco's way
And I can take it back down through the depths of Hell
And blow up the spot like an artillery shell
Cause I've been all the way to the grave and back
And mad crews are coming out sounding crazy wack
 (x4)
It's the same old, same old, blasé-blah
Sipping on the forty and puffing La

I'm sicker than the AIDS sores with Band-Aids
If my eyes are bloodshot, I just put on my shades
I never got good grades, cause I was acting the fool
Ducking out of my school, hiding smoke in the wool
And I never knew the plague until it claimed my cousin
I acted like he wasn't, but junkies come a dime a dozen
I've seen the needle and the damage done
A syringe in the vein is like a loaded gun
In your mouth blowing up the backside of your mental
The only records they can verify are your dental
The instrumental is my forum
And when I rock the mic I do it with poise and decorum
 (x4)
It's the same old, same old, blasé-blah
Sipping on the forty and puffing La",https://genius.com/House-of-pain-same-old-game-lyrics

And your walkin' tall

And get your poison chose

In your B-Boy pose
I get off Mad flows
Like a pack of eskimo's
On the dog sled in the blizzard
Cause I'm the wizard of (oz)

Come check my age
If ya can't pop
Simply turn the page
And I'll engage

Stickin to the roof of your mouth like some chippin
Peanut butter

Cause every word I utter
Rock's the sky's from the gutter

When I rock your soul
I do dames the way I like

Well if ya get bold
Well then ya get bit
Cause your knowledge is a trick
Kid, It's makin me sick

I'm Danny Boy
With the Hard Core style
I'll punch you suckers in the mouth like a root canal (Root Canal!)
You get me started and I'm hard to stop
I got 45 calibers ready to pop
And when I pop off
You drop off
You get blown out the frame
Cause the more shit change
The more things stay the same
And I got no respect for your area
From Brooklyn to Dublin
I keep your ass fumblin'
Cause I'm the fuckin ball busta
Brooklyn heart breaker
House of Pain pimp money maker

I got rhymes finesse
I got rhymes galore
I got rhymes for peace
I got rhymes for war
I got rhymes for heads
I got rhymes for skins
I got rhymes
Kid your crew ain't got no wins
So step up if you wanna get your head cracked
Run up if you wanna get your skull knocked
Play the hard rock baby get your ears boxed
I'll kill you all
Just like I was the small pox
I'll kill ya livestock
Just like I was anthrax

Reachin’ Out,The Unreleased EP,1996.0,"I say hey, baby doll
You swing your shit like a wrecking ball
5 foot 11 inches tall
Dark brown eyes, caramel skin
I ain't seen you all my life, sugar, where you been?
Tell me, who's your friend, cause this is my man
So won't you set it off between em love cause that's the plan
Hook your friend with my man
Come sit in my lap
I'll listen to you yap then
I'll bust my rap
I'll size up your gap
You size up my bone
It's thick and meaty like a hot calzone
Fresh out the oven with the all-night loving
I'll freak the styles you like but don't get from your husband
And when I call just tell em I'm your cousin
I got a dozen cousins just like you

Reaching out to all princess and queens
(all di nasty gal pickin up and nice enough in the scene)
Reaching out to all princess and queens
(Pamela, Madonna and the one named Maxine, uh)
Reaching out to all princess and queens
(Joanna, Monique and the gal named Irene)
Reaching out to all princess and queens
(keep ya mind dutty but ya body clean)

And like the other jam, let's keep the doors shut
Your nut to mine, I murder thrust with no cut
I've never been sucked from neck back to butt
Handcuffs and snuff as I watch you strut
To the window you lez out with your silhouette
Then you bend low, lift my crack to my chest
I defend my manhood and cold represent
I command my sex with the harmony tense
Mystery's designed to quake the dove stew
Destiny's blessin me when I arrive D infects the C
You do me so slow I blaze your D
I nickname you lunar beam LSD
I be eyeing any queen who wish to see
If you can dissect me in my scientific scene
Sicko, baby I'm real
Redbone steel and Cherokee appeal


Hey shorty earth piece
Stop me dead
Had to cease in my tracks
Run up and ask
At any time in your life have you been blessed?
No need to second guess
You be banging like that dress
Hanging off your frame
If it's all the same
Let me throw my game
Hit ya for your name
Plus your area code
I might overload
But I won't explode, baby doll, until you ready
My name ain't crazy legs, hon, but I can rock it steady

Third Stone From The Sun,The Unreleased EP,1996.0,"Here come the peckerwood mic wrecker
I'm sweet like nectar, MC selector
Come again, eat the style I'm busting
You think I'm dropping acid on a super cold dozen
Feel the rushing through your blood and cerebellum
And any man that defies, eyes will be swelling
So whatcha selling kid, I'll bust your melon
Then I spit out the seeds, I got dirty deeds
They're done dirt cheap, I'm on the Greek, don't sleep
I'm late cause the circus, but bullets run deep
And talk is cheap, kid, it's time to make moves
It's time to make capital gains with my brains
The song remains, the Same As It Ever Was
And you can say my crew's falling but it never does
I'm white chocolate, clockwork apocalypse
Inter-dimensional like Prince be sensual
My interplanetary, sub-galactic tactics
Got you wearing vests like prophylactics
My verbal waters rock your sons and daughters
And I'll tell more lies than priests and rabbis
And all the allies put together in a cipher
My skin's my cell, no parole on my life

Doing time on the third stone from the sun
Lucy got me on the run, kid, hold my gun
I'm dealing with the pressures, son, life ain't fun
Doing time on the third stone from the sun

I'll be getting down and dirty by 2030
Sipping off my forty, cut deep in your shorty
Lordy, glory, Hallelujah
Like a big Samoan my Sig's going Boo-Yaa
Do-wa-ditty, oh what a pity
I'm blowing up the spot like Oklahoma City
With mic terrorism and no plagiarism
And bloodshot vision cause I smoke major 'ism
If you got sob stories, kid, don't tell me 'bout em
Cause them Timb boots you wearing, I'm a lift you out em
With two shots to your bid, I ain't playing kid
I know the games that you running and all the things you did
And you'll say ""Holy cow!"" if my gun go blaow
Click-bang, watch me do my thang
My elements in order, my attributes eternal
And all you duck MC's are smelling just like the Colonel
You're all fried chicken with your back side licking
I'll play you like a snitch with the ice pick sticking
Out your eye socket and if I wanna cock it
I play Rammellzee and pull it out my pocket
I pull it out my pocket, I pull it out my pocket
Yeah, I play Rammellzee and pull it out my pocket

Lucy got me on the run, kid, hold my gun

Album:  Eddie Soundtrack
Song:   Punch Drunk
You know I rock microphones
Like they got back bones
And I'll roll on your shore like some biscuit dough
Yea you study bitin' styles off the next man's flow
Think your Jackson
But your name ain't Bo
I'm only hittin' chick fine as madeleine stowe
Got a closet in my crib where the hydro-phonic grow
Act like you know
Lee toast the chronic
It ain't the season
The reasons strictly economic
So pour the gin and tonic
Pump the Tony Bennet
If wifey ain't watchin' then I'm runnin' up in it
I'll make ya hot and spicy like some huevos rancheros
Then hit the Knicks game with my man Don Terros
And if the Knicks are winnin'
Then Spike Lee's grinnin'
Next I hit the spot with Stretch Armstrong spinnin'
Sippin wiskeys to my favorite cuts
Watchin' all the earthpieces shake their butts
Some People think I'm nuts cause I act a little funny
But play me soft I'll beat ya down like ya stole money

Throw your hands in the air and shake your caboose
Politicking with your chickens it's time to get loose
It's the wicked Pain inflictor with the MICKEYs deuce deuce...
I see a million motherfuckers goin' out on the bottle
The Heavy-Weight Champion never was a role model
I keep it idle with my B-boy bravado
From downtown Brooklyn
All the way to Colorado
So run  play the lotto kid if you feel lucky
I'm not a toy but I'll hunt you down like Chucky
You must be buggin' cause I heard you want to buck me
You must be trippin' cause your women wants to fuck me

Throw your hands in the air and shake your caboose
Politicking with your chickens it's time to get loose
It's the wicked Pain inflictor with the MICKEYs deuce deuce...
It's four for the cores
It goes on behind closed doors
When you go for yours
It matters the most
You like to brag and boast
And drink and make a toast
When you don't come up close
Kid, you be coming up ghost
Plus, you playin' hardclose (?)  like your cosa nost
But you girls on my Jimmy
Try to give me pesos
Before you finish, kid that's Spanish for kisses
I'm nuttin' up, cuttin' up
The first man who disses

Throw your hands in the air and shake your caboose
I'm politicking with your chickens It's time to get loose
It's the wicked Pain inflictor with the MICKEYs deuce deuce...
Before you play yourself, kid, put your head in a noose

An' then build shit, get off my dilznit
'Cause I don't play that, My style goes way back
I go off my head, ya know I shave my shit
I kicked my shit one time, Gook, F**k the playback!
And ya don't quit, I say ya don't quit
'Cause I'm the Prodigal Son, Ya get well-done
Just like a steak, Gimme A Break
Like Nell Carter, there's tartar on yer teeth
Homeboy ya got beef? Well then ya get broke
'Cause my crew's no joke, The House o' Pain
Is kickin' up dirt an' if we're inside the jam
Ya know we're liftin' up skirts
I'm knockin on your door, honey, Let me in...
Grabbin on the snatch, feelin on the skin
'Cause I'm down with the Freak-mode, baby
I'm at my sexual peak young lady
Ain't nobody cooler than my man Son Doobie
Don'tcha f**k around, I'll smack yer knuckles wit a ruler
Just like a nun from a Cath'lic school
I'll make ya drool, an' play the fool
Snatch ya up by th'ears, smack ya up like a queer
Take a puff off my blunt an' then sip my beer
Kick the mean style, Leave bodies in a pile
Everlast's my name, I'm from the House of Pain
Ya know that I never played the punk role
'Cause I'm the light Irish man wit a funky soul...

It's what it is, y'all
It's what it is...(x4)

Smoke like forever, quicker than the gender
Son'll be rockin, until tomorrow

'Cause I got the Right One, like Ray Charles
Follow, Swallow, the funk pass the bottle
'Cause I get wrecked like if I crashed my Auto
I play it, I win it, I done it, I did it
Some say I'm trippin, but right at this minute
I'll freak it, I'll funk it, like a country bumpkin
From Alberquerque, Who's gonna carve the turkey?
Ready, serve, entertain like Merv
The Doobie-Funk fellow, smooth like a Jello
Rip it, sniff it, Panties, I'm a perv
Some say mellow, complicated like a dello
The freakin, who's speakin? Tricks that I'll be beatin
'Cause I'll be trick-or-treatin
I used to drive a Lincoln
Drivin, speedin, hey Rif, I'm readin!
I make more money than that kid, Alex Keaton!

Run for the messhall
I rip felsh, yes y'all
An' get your grub
While I'm rhymin on your dub
Gettin play at the club
What the f**k you gonna do?
Then I step to the pub an' crack a brew-
I rip shit, kill it
Treat ya like a gas tank, take yer ass an' fill it
Cut yer gut an' spill it
To where I reside
Put yer face in my pillow
Then take ya for a ride
An' have ya weepin like a willow
I tax that butt, wax that ass

Get up everybody's 'bout to leap their feet
Get down everybody's 'bout to loose their seat

Putting psychology in your biology, no scientology dianetic anaesthetic
You took bad advice, kid i'm mad precise

Come on, let's be real, you only think you can deal
That's why i'm holdin' the steal, i rock shit to make you feel like
Damn that looks easy, maybe i can do it
So you take a fat beat and put your wack rhymes to it
And God only knows what can make you persue it
For those who can't dance and clap your hands to it
(Chorus)
Verse 3 (Everlast)
You tell me you're the baddest and you get the most cream
But tell me what's the status of your self-esteem
Your frontin' on your jewels and your benz and your lex
All the bodies that you caught and all the females you sex
Yes yes y'all, true indeed, the sight of the world keeps me high on weed
Makes my eyeballs bleed but i must proceed
Yo that chick 's good lookin' but she's hooked on speed

Now grab the bar maid and order me another Guiness
You can drink the Guiness while I'm sippin' on the mickeys

Heart Full of Sorrow (feat. Sadat X),UnKnown,UnKnown,"If I was to sit down and actually write out a list
Of the mcs that missed it would be the constitution
They play their caps backwards still saying wack words
No power to (durhust) just a few yes men
Raising the question of who gave you a contract
They should be fired you're officially retired
I see you make a little cash and start showing your ass
You get laced up with jewels your crews acting like fools
Playing hard rock surrounded by body guards
Hoping no one pulls your cord you got me laughing pretty hard
Thinking you're the white hot man of the hour
But you just can't figure how your flavor went sour
Back in 89 pe fought the power and in 86 big daddy kane was raw
And I was right there on the first floor of the palladium
You never played a venue local college or a stadium
A young boys (fiddin pad) fad is now a grown mans profession
To earn this is a blessing
This skills have me guessing learn cause I'm testing
Follow this down no question
No doubt check it out
You be either rhyming in code or on some gangster node
You all clockwork apocalypse you about to implode
Collapsing on yourself cause your whole foundation is
Built on lies don't apologize
Cause once they watch you rise they wanna watch you fall
And they'll all take a piece just like the berlin wall
And place it on their mantle like a souvenir
And what they call a knick-knack is really your career
Chorus
You ain't promise nothing but a pocket full of stress
Still there be people that would die for less
You ain't promise nothing but a heart full of sorrow
If they don't like the demo make a new one tomorrow
You ain't promise nothing but a pocket full of stress
Still there be people that would die for less
You ain't promise nothing but a heart full of sorrow
If they don't like the demo make a new one tomorrow
When it's time to rise ill open the archives
When you be in dreams you got 85s
Chrome down with the leather package
You got a home of your own
Youre holding acres
I got it made
Season tickets to the knickers and the lakers
Playing both coasts closed and european festivals
Crowd scream decibels x2
In your ear you wanna make rapping your career
From arkansas to minnesota I sell out the quota
I be the wet dream making cream for promoters
We keep the shit right we don't be starting no fights
And he won't hold out my dough cause I'm a put out his lights
And once the crew hits the stage the crowd gets involved
We show love they show it back all problems solved
You can boom shalock and jump to the sounds I pump
But I ain't quitting till I'm shitting on donald trump
So take heed to the verses and styles and versions
When you socialize with other mcs
And boast your rhymes to company enemies
And in any cases that feel is what you want
? ? ?
You want to make money money and take every honey
Rap charges ain't funny but it boost your career
Your penile style is now hanging from a tier
Now you wanna know fear to impress your peers
Now your ass outta here the rap game goes on",https://genius.com/House-of-pain-heart-full-of-sorrow-feat-sadat-x-lyrics

Battle me, that's a sin

Punk you better back up
Try and play the role and yo the whole crew will act up
Get up, stand up 
Come on, throw your hands up
If you've got the feeling
Jump up touch the ceiling
Muggs lifts a funk flow
Someone's talking junk, yo
I'll bust him in the eye
And then I'll take the punk's hoe
Feelin', funkin'
Amps in the trunk, and
I got more rhymes than there's cops at a Dunkin' Donuts shop
Sho' 'nuff I got props from the kids on the hill
Plus my mom and my pops
I came to get down

I came to drop bombs
I got more rhymes than the Bible's got Psalms
And just like the Prodigal Son, I've returned
Anyone stepping on me - you'll get burned
Cause I got lyrics but you ain't got none
If you come to battle bring a shotgun 
But if you do you're a fool, cause I duel to the death
Tryin' to step to me - you'll take your last breath
I got the skill, come get your fill
'Cause when I shoot to give, I shoot to kill
I came to get down
I came to get down
So get out your seat and jump around
Jump around, jump around, jump around
Jump up, jump up and get down
Jump, jump, jump (everybody jump)
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump, jump (everybody jump)
Jump, jump, jump, jump
I'm the cream of the crop, I rise to the top
I never eat a pig cause a pig is a cop
Or better yet a Terminator
Like Arnold Schwarzenegger
Tryin' to play me out as if my name was Sega
But I ain't going out like no punk bitch
Get used to one style and you know I might switch
It up up and around, then buck buck get down
Put out your head then you wake up in the Dawn Of The Dead
I'm coming to get ya, I'm coming to get ya
Spitting out lyrics, homie I'll wet ya
I came to get down
I came to get down
So get out your seat and jump around
Jump around, jump around, jump around
Jump up jump up and get down
Jump, jump, jump (everybody jump)
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump, jump (everybody jump)
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump, jump (everybody jump)
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump, jump (everybody jump)
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Yo, this is dedicated
