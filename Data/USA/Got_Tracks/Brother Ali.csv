Own Light (What Hearts Are For),All the Beauty in This Whole Life,2017,"You're not using your heart for
What hearts are for

They've been trying to shut us down our whole life
I thank God for healing
You ain't got to get me lit, I got my own light
Thank God for listening, listen
You've been trying to build me up my whole life
I thank God for building
You ain't got to get me lit, I got my own light
I thank God I'm living

Sometime I feel like a stranger, maybe I ain't from here
World going crazy, how could that be unclear?
Know that I'm a soldier, heart's are my battleground
Sword in the holster, had to come back around
I ain't trying to hide away, I just had to meditate
I ain't got a lot to say but the ancestors may
Speaking to the whole globe, numbers don't occur to me
You can listen solo 'cause you're the whole world to me
I jump in with both feet nothing low key
You can find me where I'm s'posed be, where my folks be
If you listen very closely you know who chose me
Nothing that I own owns me and so I'm so free
I remember being hungry needing groceries
Nighttime getting no sleep 'til my nose bleed
Got a message to the police:
You're not using your heart for what hearts are for

They've been trying to shut us down our whole life
I thank God for healing
You ain't got to get me lit, I got my own light
Thank God for listening, listen
You've been trying to build me up my whole life
I thank God for building
You ain't got to get me lit, I got my own light
I thank God I'm living

Not for one second I believe what you're telling me
I know you invented disease and sell the remedy
Universe is sending me centuries of memories
So the very breath that I breathe is all I ever need
I got that Muhammad Ali up in my pedigree
Yes I be speaking my peace up in my seventies
Ain't worry bout ya threatening me, I'm just being honest
I ain't buying fear just because it's all you got left
We just want to make love 'til we wake up
I believe whoever made us envisioned greatness
And you know they want to paint us with the same brush
Wanna interchain us 'til we fill our grave up
Alright okay but when it's all said and it's all done
And I look back at the trophies I won
I will only count one
I'm using my heart for what hearts are for

They've been trying to shut us down our whole life
I thank God for healing
You ain't got to get me lit, I got my own light
Thank God for listening, listen
You've been trying to build me up my whole life
I thank God for building
You ain't got to get me lit, I got my own light
I thank God I'm living

And I know who I am
I know whose I am
On your wings, I fly
And in your shoes, I stand
I'm animated by love, I don't move by chance
Any stage I touch or any place I stand
There y'all land, living in the world as it is
Cracked vessel, I am no more and no less than a man
Any po-sessions that I have are just in my hand
I'm balancing the best that I can
I'm not making no claims but
I'm using my heart for what hearts are for

All the beauty in this whole life (uh)
I thank God for healing
And You ain't got to get me lit, I got my own light
I thank God for listening, listen
You've been trying to build me up my whole life
I thank God for building
You ain't got to get me lit, I got my own light
I thank God I'm living

Can’t Take That Away,All the Beauty in This Whole Life,2017,"I loved you 'fore I knew that you existed
It isn't really anybody's business
Not asking for permission or a witness
It honestly doesn't make any difference
Living in this insane mess
There's only one person that can make me make sense
I've got troubles and my own fears
But as long as you're alive, I'm not alone here
My mirror, when I'm right near you
Your guiding light shines to see my life clearer
You're so woven inside my spirit
Even when you're not around I feel you
Lord knows they don't come no realer
My soul road dog my healer
The only reason I believe in me
I'm trying to be what you seem to see

When the highs get low and the joys turn woes
I'll be close forever and a day
They can't take that away
They can't take that away
(Right) When your world start falling, I can read about it all in your face
You ain't even gotta say
They can't take that away
They can't take that away
When you make your mistakes, my heart is a place
Where you're safe I never would betray
They can't take that away
They can't take that away
And what you made mine is true
Lifetime full of treasures, I'll never repay
They can't take that away

I love you and there's nothing you can do about it
I love you right through all your human problems
I might've got excited at you and shouted
But you never let me down when it truly counted
Nothing could ever break the bond
Whatever page you're on
Celebrate or mourn, babies born or parents gone
No matter how crazy the storm, you won't face it alone
The best part of me is drawn to you
Me and anything I own belong to you
I treasure everything important to you
Any secret I ever had I show them to you
I owe you nothing but the whole truth
I wouldn't want to meet the me that doesn't know you
The only reason I believe in me
I'm trying to be what you seem to see

When the highs get low and joys turn woes
I'll be close forever and a day
They can't take that away
They can't take that away
When your world start falling, I can read about it all in your face
You ain't even gotta say
They can't take that away
They can't take that away
When you make your mistakes, my heart is a place
Where you're safe I never would betray
They can't take that away
They can't take that away
And what you made mine is a true (ah, it's love)
Lifetime full of treasures, I'll never repay
They can't take that away, they can' t take that away
Oh my God now

These are wounds, not scars
It will only be a scar when it stops bleeding, stops hurting
You can forget about scars
But you cannot forget about wounds
Everyone meets the injured with sympathy or disgust
Do you need a tissue?
No, I need stitches",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-cant-take-that-away-lyrics
Pen to Paper,All the Beauty in This Whole Life,2017,"I am not beautiful, I am an elegant beast
A well-mannered monster, a charming barbarian
I will pillage your heart with language so lavishly violent
You will curse me for coming and curse me for going
Your crying and your moaning will share the same sound

Put pen to paper the first time when I was barely eight or
Maybe nine that was the late eighties, Reagan time
Put in the freshest tape rewinds, wait, let me take my time
The entire landscape of that blank page was mine
Created space to climb inside, escape the crazy times
Reshape the climate, break it down, that was my frame of mind
Thank the divine great designing this as my sacred shrine
I made myself a place to shine, wait, let me spray this rhyme
When I was thirteen I met KRS, he put me on the stage
Suggested I read up on Malcolm X, y'all know the rest
So much pushing down on my chest
Both my folks got laid to rest
Loved ones wishing me all the best
I'm a ball of stress, yet I digress
I've spent my every hopeless dream and my unspoken secret
You hear it floating through your speakers in my old releases
My fanbase began to grow beneath & crowd around me
I never tiptoed 'round here shy I spit it loud and proudly
The U.S. government profiled me and the sponsors dropped me
Some of my listeners felt a way so they no longer got me
I knew that telling that truth is costly no one alive can stop me
I rolled that flag out on the ground and prostrated my body
This is more than music to me, this is ancestors
Speaking through me at the tomb of Rumi
My mic’s a rifle I’m honor bound to fire my weapon truly
Whether they jeer me, cheer me, boo, salute me or just shoot me
Let it be known, my whole life I break that cycle set it in stone
I'd still rather be known as a man that stand on my own
Rather than beg at a throne cold
You know I still honor my own code that go down to the bone
We just want to get it on shooting at the devil
With a megaphone till we dead and gone
BOOM!",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-pen-to-paper-lyrics
Never Learn,All the Beauty in This Whole Life,2017,"I don't know where to turn
I hit my head, I guess I'll never learn
But they tell me I should let it bleed, let it sting, let it burn
Get my head firm
I don't know where to turn (Where to turn)
I hit my head, I guess I'll never learn (Never learn)
But they tell me I should let it bleed, let it sting, let it burn
Get my head firm
(My goodness, good morning)

You're still an apprentice
Every generation of MC **** with me, so I'm ill by consensus
You see what I speak
You touch it and feel it, all six of your senses
My mission is endless, I've been in this tent and I'm still as relentless
Now, build you a fence, if you're feelin' defensive
My power comes from the most high
Lord, God, of the globe sky
Soul vibration is so fly, I can walk on water, no lie
Champion author
Small fry rock of Gibraltar; Northside
Serving this culture
Might I confide that I'm here to assault ya?
I got some money in the bank that I did not have when I start
Got a little money up in my hand, I do not have money in my heart
I'm standing on champion greatness
I cannot claim it 'cause that's the creator
I stand up and state it
That's not braggin', it's prayin'
That's what I'm sayin'

I don't know where to turn
I hit my head, I guess I'll never learn
But they tell me I should let it bleed, let it sting, let it burn
Get my head firm
I don't know where to turn (Where to turn)
I hit my head, I guess I'll never learn (Never learn)
But they tell me I should let it bleed, let it sting, let it burn
Get my head firm
(Ya Hafidh, ya Wadud)

I was standin' on-stage when my hero died
Feel the heartbeat of my people's cry
Nation nineteen thirty-three, bow ties
Light of the D?n gleaming in your eyes
Even when the tears flow down both sides, you know why I sacrificed your whole life
You can go ahead, let your soul fly 'cause the whole tribe bloodline flow through mine
Listen, we love to fight 'cause we fight for love
The poor, righteous sons, where the diamonds from
Libraries are transcribin' us, and our ancestors are more alive than us
Put down everything you're tryna clutch: your undying lust to see the climate just
Baby we ride 'til our time is up
That's just the divine in us

I don't know where to turn
I hit my head, I guess I'll never learn
But they tell me I should let it bleed, let it sting, let it burn
Get my head firm
I don't know where to turn (Where to turn)
I hit my head, I guess I'll never learn (Never learn)
But they tell me I should let it bleed, let it sting, let it burn
Get my head firm
(My goodness, good morning)


I don't know where
Let it bleed
Get my head firm
Hit my head, I guess I'll never learn
Get my head firm",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-never-learn-lyrics
All the Beauty in This Whole Life,All the Beauty in This Whole Life,2017,"All the beauty in this whole life
Is reflecting your light
Cool tears obscure my sight
It's the only way I see you right
All the beauty in this whole life
Is reflecting your light
Cool tears obscure my sight

God willing I can love you 'til there's nothing but you
Disappear inside you every time I clutch you
Tears shed in your presence render walls humble
They separate me from you until I become you
Let 'em fall to rubble, let the darkness crumble
Let your light penetrate me 'til my heart is trustful
I'm afflicted with my chest constricted
And your description is the best prescription
Crack the stone in my chest and let it beat again
'Til every artery become a pharmacy
Let it deliver your love to every part of me
Until the splendor of your presence is all I see
My death wish is to decorate my every inch
With remembrance of your preciousness
Until there's no longer evidence I ever existed
Because until I knew your love, I never did

All the beauty in this whole life
Is reflecting your light
Cool tears obscure my sight
It's the only way I see you right
All the beauty in this whole life
Is reflecting your light
Cool tears obscure my sight
It's the only way I see you right

These two eyes inside of my head have never seen clearly
A whole team of geniuses couldn't seem to cure me
A lot of the time I just resign and just close them completely
And relied on what's inside me to guide me sincerely
Let the heart navigate and pray that the path is straight
Lead me directly to your threshold standing at the gate
I breathed in a sweet breath that you had let go
And somewhere in the distance heard your echo
My soul began to tremble
You resemble every mercy I've ever known
Overwhelmed me so that I began to let it flow
My lenses started welcoming the guests of tears
And suddenly the world revealed itself crystal clear
Colors grew vibrant and the decoration vivid
In that very instant I knew every thing was living
Then they released and made their way down my cheek
And here I am at the beginning, starting to seek

All the beauty in this whole life
Is reflecting your light
Cool tears obscure my sight
It's the only way I see right
All the beauty in this whole life
Is reflecting your light
Cool tears obscure my sight
All the beauty in this whole life
Is reflecting your light
Cool tears obscure my sight
It's the only way I see you right
All the beauty in this whole life
Is reflecting your light
Cool tears obscure my sight
It's the only way I see you right
All the beauty in this whole life
Is reflecting your light
Cool tears obscure my sight
It's the only way I see you right",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-all-the-beauty-in-this-whole-life-lyrics
Dear Black Son,All the Beauty in This Whole Life,2017,"Dear Black Son, there's people you've never met
Who fear and hate you for something that you never did
And these people are so self-convinced
Sometimes they pull the trigger, call that self-defense
And in that sad insanity
Their fear is realer to them than your humanity
But that's their problem, it's not yours
Listen to your pop for a second
These are the confessions of a father broken hearted
Who don't know how to pull his only son out of a target
They lied when they said it was the bottom where you started
You were a king long before them ships departed
You are not defined by anybody else's crimes
You don't need to answer for what happens in their minds
You are not confined by their imaginary lines
You don't need permission to exist with the divine
In fact, you don't need permission from no one including me
You need not do anything but be, just breathe
Whatever you dream let it mean you're free
Tears on your cheek never made nobody weak
Sometimes we got to grieve let it burn, let it bleed
Then let yourself heal, pray to God that it will
You've got a spirit that a bullet can't kill
That doesn't make it any less real

They say it takes a man to raise a man
You're slipping through my hands like grains of sand
And here I stand, tryna wrestle with the hourglass
Maybe see how long I can make an hour last
Raising a man, who's slipping through my hands like grains of sand
And here I stand, tryna wrestle with the hourglass
Maybe see how long I can make an hour last
Dear Black Son

Dear Black Son, I can't protect you like I want to
I never judge you, all I can do is love you
And that's all anyone can ever do is love you
All I can do is wonder how can anyone not love you?
They recognize divine in you
So they try to find themselves by defining you
They're living in a myth that they don't want to lose
And now they're too terrified to face your kind of truth
But every single time you shine it's proof that they might've threw a chain around your body, never conquered you
They don't always honor you but they love your culture
Let me show you how to move when the laws approach you
It's best to keep your hands where they can see them
And try to understand that you're not even what they're peeping
They don't see a sweet kid that loves his little sister
Their mind is seeing five hundred years of pictures
In fact, they don't visualize a kid
They see grown man imagery, mythic masculinity
But you are not their fetishes or fears
Nor my ambition and tears, nothing can interfere
We've got to trust our seeds once we sow them
We hold them when they're growing
But we never really own them
We love up on them, play with 'em, pray for them
And cling very closely to them moments

They say it takes a man to raise a man
You're slipping through my hands like grains of sand
And here I stand, tryna wrestle with the hourglass
Maybe see how long I can make an hour last
Raising a man, who's slipping through my hands like grains of sand
And her I stand, tryna wrestle with the hourglass
Maybe see how long I can make an hour last

Uncle Usi Taught Me,All the Beauty in This Whole Life,2017,"Mm-hmm
Uncle Usi taught me
Can't teach what you don't know
Can't lead where you don't go
Can't reap what you don't sow
Can't fool the people no more

You know me I'm a globe traveler, soul ambassador
Reporting live from the world wide massacre
No mask for the truth that animates me
See it and I speak it wherever it takes me
I'm in the Republic of Iran at a conference
Talkin' 'bout the cops and their nonsense
And how they like to hunt black folk with no conscience
And how they want to preach human rights, its preposterous
Request from the audience spit that Uncle Sam Goddamn
Drawing out the round of applauses
I was rocking a capella before this
Because I know that rapping in Iran is lawless
Ahh sh-- you know me though anything for the people
The clapping kind of tapped in to my fat rapper ego
I fell into the trap plugged in my Mac and let the beat go
Didn't think that nobody would hear though, here we go

Can't teach what you don't know
Can't lead where you don't go
Can't reap what you don't sow
Can't fool the people no more
Oh, here he go
Can't teach what you don't know
Can't lead where you don't go
Can't reap what you don't sow
Can't fool the people no more
This is how it go

Friday we greet each other at the mosque
But here there's only one and the government preacher talks
Which struck me as odd but nothing could prepare me for
A big ass mob chanting ""Death to America""
It felt like somebody talking 'bout my mama, wait
It's all real but I'ma still feel some type of way
You mean the system and I'm with you on that
But you got to be more specific than that
You ain't talkin' 'bout the families getting whipped in the back
I'm trippin' cause I've never felt defensive like that
Okay so meanwhile footage of me spitting these raps
Is playing on every TV station they have
They jail people for that
The local rappers all start clapping back
Death threats all in my social media apps, hm
I started lookin' at the people that brought me here
Like, ""what the hell y'all got me on man I'm out of here""

Can't teach what you don't know
Can't lead where you don't go
Can't reap what you don't sow
Can't fool the people no more
Oh, here y'all go
Can't teach what you don't know
Can't lead where you don't go
Can't reap what you don't sow
Can't fool the people no more
This is how it go

This that international gang banging and
My homeland hit Iran with the sanctions
And my credit cards and telephone ain't happening
But I can't imagine a better land to be stranded in
Almost everyone that see me coming
Want to take me home and they trying to feed me something
But I took the last forty dollars that I had
And headed to the airport in a cab and there I sat
Starving cause there's only one flight a day
I can't even buy a ticket tryna find a way
Somebody seen me on TV and recognized my face
And let me write an email to my wife in the states
I'm in the airport three days, wondering if I'm even safe
Finally got a seat on the plane
Now imagine my exhausted embarrassment
Got back to America they interrogate me like a terrorist
Really?

Can't teach what you don't know
Can't lead where you don't go
Can't reap what you don't sow
Can't fool the people no more
Watch where you go
Can't teach what you don't know
Can't lead where you don't go
Can't reap what you don't sow
Can't fool the people no more",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-uncle-usi-taught-me-lyrics
Pray For Me,All the Beauty in This Whole Life,2017,"Somebody pray for me
(Bless his, bless his heart)
Somebody please pray for me

Somebody pray for me
(Bless his, bless his heart)
What more could you say to me?
(Bless his, bless his heart)

The first day of third grade
Topic of discussion at the kick ball game
Is who's the new student why he look that way?
A eight-year-old expert determined I've got AIDS
A vote must've been taken, it became my name
I mean literally AIDS is my name okay
It made its way around the school and eventually
I heard a teacher try to catch herself as she yelled it to me
I tried to be invisible honestly
Wishing that the ground would just open up, swallow me
What kind of crime did I commit for this mockery?
Guess I must've lost some kind of cosmic lottery
How am I processing this at a baby's age?
It felt like I had a gut full of razor blades
I fantasized someone else would come take my place
Because they taught me to hate my face

Somebody please pray for me
(Bless his, bless his heart)
Somebody pray for me
(Bless his, bless his heart)
Somebody please pray for me
(Bless his, bless his heart)
What more could you say to me?
(Bless his, bless his heart)

Imagine how my mama felt
Obviously she want to offer me some kind of help
Pretty white lady never probably dealt
With this particular type of hell
If she dyed my hair blonde maybe I can blend
Get a better response maybe even a friend
She took me to the salon, put chemicals in my head
When they took the towel off, it was purple in the end
Lot of money spent just to get me presentable
Message that it sent, the real you ain't acceptable
I knew what she meant, what else could she expect to do?
That was just the lens that she viewed protection though
And so eventually I began to see that
What grows out of me is my dirty little secret
Had to go back every few weeks to keep it
I think that part depressed me the deepest

Somebody please pray for me
(Bless his, bless his heart)
Somebody pray for me
(Bless his, bless his heart)
Somebody please pray for me
(Bless his, bless his heart)
What more could you say to me?
(Bless his, bless his heart)

Thank God for the grown ups
That roll up when they know it's time to hold us
The elder queen showed so much homegrown love
She said ""hair doesn't die but your soul does""
She said ""Elvis wore his hair in a pompadour
So he could try to look like Muddy Waters more""
But he would fry his crown so that he could lay it down
Like a white boy they called it a conk before
Until James Brown came kicked down the door
Say it loud, I'm black and I'm proud my boy
That's the meaning behind the afros and all
Get free being what it is that you know you are
She said ""Beauty's the splendor of truth
You will never cut loose 'til you're suitable to you
And your living is the proof just let it do what it do
Now watch them follow suit and try to catch up to you""

Somebody musta prayed for me
(Bless his, bless his heart)
Somebody prayed for me
(Bless his, bless his heart)
Somebody musta prayed for me
(Bless his, bless his heart)
What more could you say to me?

Before They Called You White,All the Beauty in This Whole Life,2017,"At what point did poor European people that used to rebel
Against the ones that forced them to work land they didn't own and die with nothing of their own
What was it that turned their hearts so that they'd start to identify with power even though they're powerless?
Identify with wealth even though they're broke?
It's the invention of whiteness

They call you white by white standards
Damn what they're talking 'bout, you man first
Stand and curse the dirty hand that first crafted the plan
Spread it through the land and shattered the damn Earth
This is sickest system that ever existed
Since this Earth's beginning commenced, it's twisted
How you convince man with red blood to bleed?
Completely devalue what a human being means
Nobody called themselves white several centuries ago
They were living off the land with the trees
They were Dutch, they were Irish, they were German
They were Greek with culture, families, tradition and beliefs
And rich blood suckers saw new soil to seize
And they ain't 'bout to get their hands dirty, cracker please
Swindled you to trade in your identity
Showed you pie in the sky and promised you a piece
With symbolic image in the scripture that you're readin'
White holy angels and black evil demons
You were so starving that you started to believe it
Now you'll die colonizing for somebody else's greed
Don't you see the overseers are still in the field?
Every breath a warden breathe is still in the jail
You will never own that farm or the prison for real
Terrified of the time when your victims rebel
Listen you don't fear them, you fear the blood on your hand
All the ugly you done to that man
That woman, that child, that land
That sea, that sky, that they'd look you in the eye
And demand that you tell them why
All them years whipping, and lying, and killing
Generations of poison, and bombing, and drilling
All designed to turn the hearts of your children to stone
Got post traumatic slave master syndrome
How the hell are y'all going to heal, be made whole?
You identifying with the people in control
You can't throw a human in the bottom of a boat
Unless somebody got a damn chain around your soul
In that middle passage asking who got stole?
A hot auction block where your blood ran cold
Every day a cop let them shots explode
You gon' have to find a way to regain your soul

I said the eye can't see itself
It can't sit back, critique itself, and peep itself
It need help
Take the sword for example
No matter how hard, it can't carve its own handle
Said the eye can't see itself
It can't sit back, critique itself, and peep itself
It needs help
Take the sword for example
No matter how hard, it can't carve its own handle

The inner city of our cities is like another country. The rules are different. It's almost like you need a passport there. The police treat people differently. When I lived out in the suburbs, if my car broke down on the highway and a state trooper pulled up behind me, I wouldn't have been scared. I'd have been glad. But young man after young man after young man had been beaten by the police and the only way you know, you've got to be with the people and we live separated. We go in air conditioned cars and we stick on your interstates and hang out with people just like us. Well, by God's grace, I was brought into this, and seeing how race plays a part and how poverty plays a part, and my job is to go out to the American people",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-before-they-called-you-white-lyrics
Special Effects,All the Beauty in This Whole Life,2017,"I don't want to see you in a screen
I want to feel you in the flesh and on the scene
I love all the words and what it mean
But it's so much to say in the spaces in between
I don't want to watch dots disappear
Listen here, first reaction is crystal clear
I want the uncut sentiment
Before you had a chance to second guess and edit it
I love you for the first draft you
All the technology on Earth can't improve
No special effects and no Santa Claus
Uncut, acoustic, and analog
A lifetime measured in breaths
The face is a mirror that the heart reflects
And when the eyes meet, they directly connect
And that's what you call true special effects

Staring at your picture hanging nicely on the wall
Longing to be near you because life is way too short
I traveled through the night 'til morning light broke through the storm
Just to see your face again, just to see your face
Staring at your picture hanging nicely on the wall
Longing to be near you because life is way too short
I traveled through the night 'til morning light broke through the storm
Just to see your face again

I don't want to watch your life in pictures
I'm trying to be right there with ya
We'll be so rich at the end of all of this
We can scroll through memories without any filter
I'm trying to share life as it comes
No timeline from the night to the sun
Crème de la crème and the crust and the crumbs
Type of love you can't type with your thumbs
Let me not hear your voice in a speaker
I'm tryna feel your breath when it leaves ya
Message received, you best to believe
Your real life friend is requesting to see you
I'm here to watch your story unfold
I don't really want to only be told
Everything I hold is pressed to my chest
That's what you call special effects (yes!)

Staring at your picture hanging nicely on the wall
Longing to be near you because life is way too short
I traveled through the night 'til morning light broke through the storm
Just to see your face again, just to see your face
Staring at your picture hanging nicely on the wall
Longing to be near you because life is way too short
I traveled through the night 'til morning light broke through the storm
Just to see your face again, just to see your face again

Into me you see, I see
Inherent in here, I hear
I give fidelity free
See my peers appear, my dear
Into me you see, I see
Inherent in here, I hear, my dear
(Just to see your face again, just to see your face)

Groove to the beat that free your mind state
Put your heartbeat on vibrate
In other words, what?
In other words, huh?
Move to the beat that free your mind state
Put your heartbeat on vibrate
In other words, what?
In other words, huh?",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-special-effects-lyrics
Out of Here,All the Beauty in This Whole Life,2017,"Okay so it might appear
To an outsider that you found your way up out of here
They're saying you died of suicide
That's the last thing I want to hear
They tell me that it's hardly fair to blame myself
What a hell of a cross to bare
You didn't say it in your letter
But the fact that I failed you is loud and clear
Found out the amount of fear
You would drown when you found yourself naked staring down a mirror
And partners are supposed to lay the cards bare
I left you playing solitaire, and I promise you that I'm sincere
If you're looking for some judgment, you won't find it here
Let's be honest here
I can't say I've never known that kind of despair
When the clouds appear, how's life fair
I just want to draw you near
Not to make it about me, but how could you check out
Before you really allowed me a chance to sit down and hear?
I think I would've listened
Or were you saying it all along and I just missed it?
You sang your swan song, we all dismissed it
Because you filled the room with laughter
I watched when you thought no one was looking at you
In hind sight, I wonder where your smile went
When the party ended and you swallowed it
I saw you swallow it

Okay so it might appear
That you took yourself up out of here
How many cries soak through your disguise
Before you drown in your silent tears?
Okay so it might appear
That you took yourself up out of here
How many times can you fight for your life
Before you throw that white flag up and volunteer?
Okay so it might appear
That you took yourself up out of here
How many cries soak through your disguise
Before you drown in your silent tears?
Okay so it might appear
That you took yourself up out of here
How many times can you fight for your life
Before you throw that white flag up and volunteer?

I've had car accidents
Where everything is slow motion no matter how fast it's happening
Every second that pass stretches so that you can watch it unraveling
But can't always react to it
Your whole life might flash before your eyes
The minute when you transition to the other side
But what can actually happen in that time?
In-between the leaping and the moment you collide
In-between the trigger and the blast
In-between you let go of the wheel and you crash
In-between the moment when you swallow the last pill in the bottle
Turn out the lights, roll the dice on tomorrow
Is there a moment to reflect, can there be regret?
Is there a wait not yet, let me reset?
Or is it just too painful to accept?
That maybe death just seemed best

Okay so it might appear
That you took yourself up out of here
If you not winning, you can go down swinging
Even if it doesn't feel like they're fighting fair
Okay so it might appear
That you took yourself up out of here
I'm trying not to resent you
But you left me defenseless in the life we share

Every man before me in my fam died by his own hands
How am I supposed to understand my own role in the plan
When nobody who grows old stands a chance?
What about this mysterious dance
Made you cut the cord to the curtain in advance?
But these are questions I can only ask
The person looking back in the looking glass",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-out-of-here-lyrics
It Ain’t Easy,All the Beauty in This Whole Life,2017,"I did it again, huh? Yeah I know
I'm writing you a song though
It goes something like this...

You said one love, you can't unlove
I don't know what it is you're trying to run from
Like you just, you tryna unfriend me in real life?
I want it all real, nothing fake please
I don't want to wonder what your handshake means
I don't need to say everything I think I must
My ego's trying to ruin everything I touch
What I mean though or what my point is
That you're much more important than my point is
If I win an argument and lose your heart Lord
Hit the bullseye on the wrong dart board
Want to thank everyone for being patient with me
It's a journey that I'm on, I pray you take it with me
And to quote myself that's what this is about
""We live learn and figure it out""
Oh my God now...

It ain't easy when it's real
Just don't leave because I still need your patience
And hear me when I say this
It ain't easy when it's real
In my heart you know I feel
All your greatness and baby we can make it

I want the real love, not the false kind
Not the one that need perfectness at all times
When it seems most difficult to keep me close
Is probably the time that I need you most
I let you down though, I didn't mean to
Even the people who try, we get weak too
And when you said we were family, I believed you
Because I needed so bad for it to be true
Now is my heart that way? Would I try to betray?
Is there any such thing as an honest mistake?
If what you need and what I have don't match
That's when we need the love thing to fill those gaps up

It ain't easy when it's real
Just don't leave because I still need your patience
And hear me when I say this
It ain't easy when it's real
In my heart you know I feel
All your greatness and baby we can make it

(You tryna save the world, right?)
Yo I'm a hot mess and if I'm honest
It's not just one event but a process
If I'm tryna get out here and protest
Let me first save the world from my foolishness
Let me guard my heart from it's harshness
Try to rid my truth of it's falseness
If your beauty is closer than an arms length
You'd be hard pressed to tell me that it's far fetched
I know I hurt you though, you took it personal
But what's love if the essence isn't merciful?
And I see no need for us to live with regrets
I'd rather just forgive and forget
Oh my God now

It ain't easy when it's real
Just don't leave because I still need your patience
And hear me when I say this
It ain't easy when it's real
In my heart you know I feel
All your greatness and baby we can make it

I was thinking maybe not debate politics in the pool
Nah, just because it's your daughter's birthday party I just.. You  know
No, I feel you
Yeah, word up, email me about that
You said one love, can't unlove
I don't know what you think you're tryna run from
You said one love, can't un-love, tryna run from
Said one love love love
Said one love love love
Said one love love love",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-it-aint-easy-lyrics
The Bitten Apple,All the Beauty in This Whole Life,2017,"Dark places I would play
I watch the night turn into day
Screaming voices in my mind
Leave me cold and so hard to find
Thank God those demons didn't last
Dealing with the wreckage of my past
Not dying, (keep the fire burning) no not dying (I'm tryin' ta)

There's no suicide like the lie that you tell yourself and believe it
Mask look decent, face is weeping underneath it
Self-hate feasting on our deepest darkest secrets
Warning signs that read help needed, too ashamed to seek it
Seems so easily deleted when you're browsing
But can't erase the history of what your eyes allowed in
The intimately profound ecstasy that gives life's
Stripped of all its meaning 'til it eats you from the inside
The big lie, you just do this to get you through the slim times
One click at a time 'til you prefer the counterfeit kind
Seen so many scenes that it would seem you're desensitized
Just to get your fix, you begin dipping into the sick side
Seeking to feed a demon that you no longer recognize
If you swear it off, you'll never find a place you can hide
Inside your pocket lies a portal to your inner battle
Children of Adam still grappling with that bitten apple

Dark places I would play
I watch the night turn into day
Screaming voices in my mind
Leave me cold and so hard to find
Thank God those demons didn't last
Dealing with the wreckage of my past
Not dying (keep the fire burning) no not dying

Don't get it twisted
There's no innocence existing in its biggest business
You create specific demand whenever you click it
Whatever it is you're into someone's got to fill it
Have their lowest moments frozen to be shown infinite
You watch the porn get savager
Box office movies nastier, the TV gettin' trashier
School girls are flashing the camera
Profile pic look just like the next amateur
Babies get exposed no one's controlling how it damage them
You find yourself detaching, retreating, reacting
Deep anger, decreased passion and you keep lashing out
Your sweet family reminds you of your weak habits
You have no mercy for yourself and so you're relapsing
Your sweet attraction used to drive you to that deep connection
You're feeling so cold and lonely when you least expect it
Atop your desk sits a portal to your inner battle
Children of Adam still grappling with that bitten apple

Dark places I would play
I watch the night turn into day
Screaming voices in my mind
Leave me cold and so hard to find
Thank God those demons didn't last
Dealing with the wreckage of my past
Not dying (I keep the fire burning)
No not dying (I'm trying to keep it..)

Now that I have died I have no taste for life
Or the affairs of  the living
Only for love, and the affair of the lovers
The affairs of the living are many and assorted
The affair of the lovers is, singular, and complete
Do not mourn this walking carcass
Some are dead because they are without life
Others are dead because they are beyond life
Yet, others have forgotten the affair of life and death altogether",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-the-bitten-apple-lyrics
We Got This,All the Beauty in This Whole Life,2017,"Here we are together
Watching the world come down around us
I know my baby girl she counting on us
If she ask me about it I got be honest
Either they forgot about us or they got a target on us
And my niece is shooting amateur porno
Police shoot my nephews in the street like it's normal
But they've been doing that a century or like four though
It's horrible, still pains me to my core though
I know that when the dust settles and the smoke clears
And the wretched of the earth living with no fears
All we need is someone here who can remind us of how great it was
Before these people had their way with us
I know when I was on the street and struggling
You know you took me in to feed my hunger pain
And now you put me on my feet, look what I became
Even when we disagree that love remains
Listen these people they ain't trying to save our soul
So why we bickering about which way to go?
You know the words are incidental
The hearts are instrumental
As long as we're connected we can make it though
We got...

Love
Should I ever call your name
I know that you can feel my pain
You'll be on your way to see me through
We got this
Love
Should you ever call my name
You know that I feel the same
I'll be on my way to see you through
We got this

I'm not grinning cause I'm at a loss of opposition
Lot of them don't want me livin'
Thank God it's not your decision
I don't hate for a minute
A drop in the infinite
'Cause hate got a small percentage of envy in it
My enemies are not my teachers
I'm not seeking to adopt your features
I don't want or need you
My heart has been broken into, but I'm not broken in two
Don't need you to acknowledge the piece of me that lives in you
The truth was never yours to give us, it's always in us
You cut your roots off, you're finished
Heart's missing and you're looking at the raw authentic
Ya'll been listening, but ya'll don't get it, just mimic
I'm grinning cause I hear my echo in it
When you whisper to your infant
I'm glad I could be of some benefit
God bless, but the voice ain't the sound coming out of the hole
That's from deep down inside of our soul
Something ya'll need to know

Late at night I find it harder to rest easy bruh
It's like this heartache has no intention of easin' up
Cause every twenty four hours is another homicide
And they keep telling me that being emotional is unreasonable
Now I'm just trying to find a way that I can maintain
So I turned this love affair with words into my main thing
Putting all the hope I got left in the vocal expression
And maybe the message will make the world amazing
And finally my daddy can understand me a little better
See why I gave up my B.A. for another set of letters
Cause if he knew to what degree I sacrifice for this road
He might be prouder of the life I chose to go get us
But time's too precious to be wasted on the grudge between us
Ain't no bond greater than the share of flesh and blood between us
And we can make it through the toughest times together
If we let our guards down and just allow our love to lead us right",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-we-got-this-lyrics
Tremble,All the Beauty in This Whole Life,2017,"I'm a man, not a brand
Heart knows no bar code that can be scanned
Revealing what can't be held up in the hand
Bearer of the standard that you cram to understand
Uncharted land telescopes can't discover
Can't throw it at strippers to make 'em pretend they love you
I sew the seed like fabric at the seams
You can't sip it to lean, but you can give it to fiends
The most taken for granted on the planet
You can't Snapchat it or Instagram it
It's from the unseen realm where the camera can't film
But the coal gets scorched into diamonds in the kiln
Created and evolved, the khaliq and the rabb
The sun, moon and the stars, Alhamdulillah
The biggest secret but you can't Wikileak it
Cause an unbroken chain transmit it to the seekers
Little mysteries bring the biggest victories
I'ma click the dhikr beads until I'm rid of this disease
We the breath of God that was left in charge
They dread the second we remember what we are

I tremble in the presence of it
I tremble at the mention of it
I tremble in the presence of it
I tremble at the mention of it
I tremble in the presence of it
I tremble at the mention of it
I tremble in the presence of it
I tremble at the mention of it

The infinite love that animate the finite
The necessary where the possible derive light
Uncreated majesty and mercy
Irrestible end of every journey

Self Taught,Champion EP,2004,"I'm home
Uh, yeah
They always ask me, '
Ali, what you so angry for man? Why you always so upset? '
I tell 'em ' Shit, theres a thin line between anger and hunger my man
And I ride a unicycle down the middle, you might catch me touchin' feet down on both sides '

Ever since day number one, it's just me and where I'm coming from
Rites of Passage and Shadows on the Sun
My people, I stand before you, As a man with more true shit
Than he knows what to do with
I give it all to you, long as you can promise me this
When it's time, you will ball up a fist (like this)
Me and Anthony, we fill all the gaps in
And are proud of what we make, regardless what happens
Fuck rappin', I sing off key
One thing you should never do is dis Ali
Cause, motherfucker, there ain't nothin' rougher
Then tryin' to climb from the rug you get swept under
I can run through every one of your blunders
Mistake number one is that your crew don't love ya
I'll take a bullet for the core of the Sayers
When me and my dogs out tourin' the nation
I spit with an intensity you have to witness
Look close, my blood on the back of the tickets
It's that religious, it's what I teach my son
How to read the Qur'an and how a party is won

We like ' Doctor, don't get it mistaken
We carve life out when we sit in the basement
We self-taught, it's as real as you make it
Anyway you look at it this shit is amazing
Doctor, don't get it mistaken
We carve life out when we sit in the basement
We self-taught, it's as real as you make it
Anyway you look at it this shit is amazing'

When line meets mine, we bend ya girl's spine
Figure-eight status, she got back for days
The same old magic will not crack the maze
The lights changed since we anted up, pot has been raised
And I'm fucking with the hand I was dealt
Live twenty-five years to experience what Lazarus felt
If you drop three crumbs, I'll eat one
Feed one to the family, rest'll get invested in my freedom
I battle through carton of shit
With a wrist, full of broken tooth picks, tryin' to carve out a niche
You can either choose the heart or the fist, but you will connect with me
If your path ever intersect with me
The fire in the eye could never be held back, (it's the same)
Pressure that made the liberty bell crack, (it's the same)
Pressure that made my brother E sell crack, (in the name)
Qur'an, holy, Rest in Peace
My back is bein' watched by, the only one on high
We stride in the party, hoods up, crossed eyes
Broke as what, but don't give a fuck
Cause I feel I got the world by the nuts, Uhh!

We like, ""Doctor, don't get it mistaken
We carve life out when we sit in the basement
We Self Taught, it's as real as you make it
Anyway you look at it this shit is amazing
Doctor, don't get it mistaken
We carve life out when we sit in the basement
We Self Taught, it's as real as you make it
Anyway you look at it this shit is amazing""

Homeboy understand, I ain't mad at you
There's just very few things in life I know how to do
And this is one of them right here

And whatever comes up comes out
We don't put our hands on our mouths, I stand for what I'm about
Unknown but I'm still a soldier
Can't let em go home till I win 'em over
My youth was training, it's very clear
Every year, new city, new rules to play with (true shit)
New kid in school, didn't rule nothin'
To this day I rap like I'm trying to prove something
Little bit aggressive, when I spit a sentence
Till you get the message
You couldn't pay me to quit professin'
Rock sixty-one sold out shows, came home, and caught a bus to the
Sixty-second
Shirt sweated full of work ethic
Been in love with the shit since I first met it
Rhymesayers is the first to come, last to leave
Ain't no tricks up our sleeve, this is what we believe

We like ' Doctor, don't get it mistaken
We carve life out when we sit in the basement
We Self Taught, it's as real as you make it
Anyway you look at it this shit is amazing
Doctor, don't get it mistaken
We carve life out when we sit in the basement
We Self Taught, it's as real as you make it
Anyway you look at it this shit is amazing'",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-self-taught-lyrics
Rain Water,Champion EP,2004,"A question was raised to me the other day
""Why it seem I always have joy?""
Well, I'd like to take time to set the record straight..
All the joy I've ever known
Has disappeared
- into motherfuckin' thin air
Like it's never even been there
My joy left me y'all

God's rain water flow through the same gutter
That we, walk today, gotta stay brave brother
Keep your lips stiff, keep your fist clenched
At times you gotta kick your way through this bitch

And I can't stop feelin' guilty smilin'
A wise man once told me that every cloud has a silver lining
I wanted to believe him but it's a trick to find 'em
When the people around me continue dying
Granddad was in the twilight of his life
When he closed his eyes tight and opened his wrists wide
What make a tenth round fighter with the winning score
Decide he need to throw the towel before the whistle blow
Maybe I'll never know
But I inherited his poetic soul so the symbolism's yet to show
Was life so obscene that death's more serene?
Or was an old author tryin' to write his own closing scene?
Nothing stings like knowing that the woman that gave me this life
Is being eaten from the inside
I thought we never make shit right
I wish I'd have viewed it once clear before you were done here
That's two in one year that I let leave here
Loving me without shedding one single tear
Either I'm one of the strongest people left
Or y'all should stone me for even tryin' to steal breath

And God's rain water flow through the same gutter
That we, walk today, gotta stay brave brother
Keep your lips stiff, keep your fist clenched
At times you gotta kick your way through this bitch

They say shit's strapped but you all by yourself, ain't ya?
Damn straight, I got a jail cell nature
Been boxed up but I never been settled in
Him got tough started developing leather skin
I learned to make that face that tells predators
It's better to re-assess just who you 'bout to wrestle with
I'm on one like the first kick drum of the beat
Clear my lungs, spit blood on the street
They telling me we got nothin' to fear but fear itself
But I fear I have no human fear left
Some day I'm gonna wanna peel back these calluses
And really feel life again and that's what my challenge is
I been kickin' and bitin' for so long and
When they throw me a rescue rope I'll be too weary to hold on
And see the light, so I sing through the tears
In the key of life, the way a wounded eagle might

And God's rain water flow through the same gutter
That we, walk today, gotta stay brave brother
Keep your lips stiff, keep your fist clenched
At times you gotta kick your way through this bitch
My joy left me y'all
She don't show her face around these parts
Every time she come she get chased off
So she stay distant

If it wasn't for me squintin' he wouldn't know the sun was out
I hate every word that come outta his fuckin' mouth
Ladies treat him special, don't know nothin' 'bout him
They saw what his wife see they wouldn't fuss 'bout him
He can't do shit right but rap and make babies
And babies need daddy at home consistent
But rap keep daddy on the road religious
So even in my two loves my soul's so conflicted
My son came into this world innocent
He deserves everything that he needs to live in it
And this home I made for him is broken
I'm hopin' his love for me will never grow thin
It hurts daddy to no end to know when
You're cryin' at the hospital I'm out tryin' to rock a show
I made a vow that we'd never be broke again
And I'd never be a burden on another friend
So when I'm sweatin' on my farewell stage
And wrote my last hook in my last rhyme book
When I get my last line of approval from my family
This is the man that I have to be

And God's rain water flow through the same gutter
That we walk today, gotta stay brave brother
Keep your lips stiff, keep your fist clenched
At times you gotta kick your way through this bitch
Sometimes
I feel
Like I'm Al-most gone",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-rain-water-lyrics
Love on Display,Champion EP,2004,"Goodbye Goodbye my love

We move all the merch, CDs and shirts
For you, this is a game but for me this is work
I punch in ha, when I step on the stage
I get paid when my record is played

Word to Printmatic
I'm a poetry chick magnet
With Goldie the pimp habits
I roll with a limb that is
Droven Omaha, flowin' for hick ass kids
Knowin' I was zonin' at the moment I hit that shit (I love y'all)
Kris references and no one will get that shit
I even make the best of it and go home and slit my wrists
Imagine what a trip it is, rappin' for little shits
Who think that DJin' was created by Mr. Dibbs
Remember this, those are the main ones that show us support
So I owe them my existence and shit so
I got to thank them, my home is broken ain't it?
I downloaded parents cause I heard they're overrated
I pushed a demo tape when the group was first created
Younger Brother was the debut album when they made it
E! Behind The Music, believe that I've been through it
I either write the true shit or feel my life is useless
You should, do this, math with me right quick dog
I cry myself to sleep when the lights get soft
Tour twice, in the spring and the fall
Ten weeks each my son doesn't see me at all
Now out of 12 months daddy's gone for 5
Spot dates in the mix, I'm absent for 6
So I'm a half ass daddy
Part time singer
Half ass crazy, got my wife feelin' half single
In New Jersey, bitchin' with the word play
About how my parents raised me in the worst way possible
Doin' what I gotta do
And tryin' to get a rap or two
Missin' my own son's third birthday
I'm a self centered piece of shit
Stomped down hypocrite
Tryin' to get a grip on it but now I got to live with it
This is me motherfucker, I'm a mean mugger
Not intentionally brother, I was tryin' to see somethin'
I never drive because I'm legally blind
All I can do is describe what I see in my mind
People are fine until they peep a weakness of mine
Then they fuck me over so I need to leave them behind
Shit's real
My wrist is still stiff from my last hook
Cat learned how to scrap just by gettin' his ass whupped
I'll catch an elbow and that shit will just hurt
So I swing mine the next time I get in some dirt
And that works
And that's why Murs is the homie
Because the brothers ain't scared to dig out spurs in the moment
My recipe for greatness, there is no depleting this
Because the active ingredient in it is my weaknesses
I speak with this little drawl that the Midwest created
When they treat someone like shit for a decade
Anthony can't chirp, flare or backspin
But he'll listen to my fucked up life without laughin'
I'm challenged and offended by sheets of blank paper
Who act like they are too good to carry my strange flavor
Painstakingly, suffice is to say
I ain't scared to put my motherfuckin' life on display",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-love-on-display-lyrics
Bad Ma Fucka,Champion EP,2004,"I circle my opponents like a bird of prey, in search of a vertebrae
Just to curse your day, and make blue sky revert to gray
Trying to work my way back to where the purpose gave birth
To the perfect way to quench my thirst to slay rappers
Penetrate your fragile brain matter
Stand glaring at you with command, and frame, and stature
Actually mastered the talent it takes to seize the breath
Out of your chest and leave em shaking
These heads never impressed us, I credit the best cause I
Mix every breath with respect for my predecessors
To die the best of deaths is meaning gunfire
Blessed with faith alone, testing the oppressive
This dimension inside your pain is my domain
By signing my name I solidify the rain
In an instant I will drain em, get em out the game
Insisted upon bickering with death until the quiet came
In silence remained, touched him with his lights out and
I'm in his veins, ushering his life out him
He cried when it came, the moment he froze
And death pulled his soul through the hole in his nose
From the moment I sight 'em, decide I don't like 'em
I evacuate the little bit of life they got inside 'em
Somebody gon' get dead tonight
Bad mother fucker gotta split heads tonight
From the moment I sight 'em, decide I don't like 'em
I evacuate the little bit of life they got inside 'em
Somebody gon' get dead tonight
Bad mother fucker gotta split heads tonight
Let 'em watch the Brother rip, they need to fucking study it
Hella the missin pieces like they tryin' to make the puzzle fit
It's some other shit, nothing like when we discovered it
Fools rapping like they tried to suck a dick and bust they lip
Half assing and ain't mastered to crowd for shit
They pacifists and there ain't nothing bout them passionate
Never had a pay a bill, or spent a day in jail
And hold mic's like they're scared as hell to break a nail
Keep your behind inside your seat, eyes upon your feet
Need to keep riding the dick instead of tryin' to ride the beat
I come from a time when rhyming was true self defining
Ain't no time for whining, protecting your little hymen
If your crew's really the shit, prove it in your set
You really should get off the stage, you're too pretty to sweat
If he's not in alliance, beat him in to compliance
Something to do while I'm feeding him to the lions
Keep being defiant, ain't nothing I can say to you
Except you better stay out my range of view, a day or two
Your friendly neighborhood Rhymesayer, I'll lay a
Asswhoopin on ya, that's one of a kind, playa
From the moment I sight 'em, decide I don't like 'em
I evacuate the little bit of life they got inside 'em
Somebody gon' get dead tonight
Bad mother fucker gotta split heads tonight
From the moment I sight 'em, decide I don't like 'em
I evacuate the little bit of life they got inside 'em
Somebody gon' get dead tonight
Bad mother fucker gotta split heads tonight
You live in a world of artificial turf, plastic sky
Got the nerve to stay up nights and ask it why
?Ho's? fucking your shit up, you're forced to pucker your lips up
That gets flipped up, you can kiss your own ass goodbye
You don't understand me, I don't have Plan B
I don't have a Mom and Dad to help me land on my feet
I don't have the luxury of living where the grass is green
Ink pen victims and ten of their friends with them
Ive been kicking, scratching scraping for respect
Since knee-high, believe I will take it to your neck
I release my, venomous sentiments at the drop of a hat
You motherfuckers got a problem with that?
I step through all possible traps
Once you walk with your balls fully exposed it's hard to look back
And I gotta react, not for nothing, just to cuss you
There ain't nothing subtle 'bout an old fashioned ""Fuck You""
From the moment I sight 'em, decide I don't like 'em
I evacuate the little bit of life they got inside 'em
Somebody gon' get dead tonight
Bad mother fucker gotta split heads tonight
From the moment I sight 'em, decide I don't like 'em
I evacuate the little bit of life they got inside 'em
Somebody gon' get dead tonight
Bad mother fucker gotta split heads tonight",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-bad-ma-fucka-lyrics
Heads Down (You Haven’t Done That Yet),Champion EP,2004,"The Number One Set and Sound (Word, Live)

'You... You... Only You'
In about four bars a married man will begin to speak
M-m-m-m-m-m-many have claimed, to obtain, levels of boning
But when I meet their women I'm like, ""They must be joking?""
They stroking, but after ten minutes you begin gizzing
Bend her down, flip her 'round, find a way to switch position
Changing, rearranging, let her seduce ya
Don't try to rush the panties cause you'll always be the loser
And laughed at, hated on, you can't perform
With those that control they tongue, on and on and on
Let's get specific, my frame crescent thicken, you're sexually uplifted
With the freak in you, don't act the way these cats do
Way I maneuver, Kama Sutra give me a statute
So now I ask you, and tell you brothers literally
When it comes to hooking up with these ladies y'all ain't better than me
Down with RNC, endlessly reciting poetry
Anytime I'm in the bed my wife is there exploring me
Then I ""No!"" I'm not ready to share my game plan
Many say they're free, but this style, they haven't attained yet

Renege you, son, bumping through dunn, don't you know its your biology to cum
What separates the men from boys, masturbation from love making
Is making your women really humm
Cause by the time you finally get her open she get done
And rock the body, then UP you gotta run
See only a sucka pull a move like that
Then wonder why your women getting hers behind your back
Select the right time and place
Put it in her face, and taste creation of the human race
Its all about the physical built up you created
Your time wit it kid, and let her escalade
Then while you'll STICK!, she'll GRIND!
Don't touch youself, she's out of time, here's another rhyme",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-heads-down-you-havent-done-that-yet-lyrics
Chain Link,Champion EP,2004,"I try to always buy Final Call from the F.O.I
Even though that's not what Islam always signify
I gotta love the struggle in 'em
They would get on their knees and shine shoes
'fore they'd ever let the drugs afflict 'em
Makin tacos or fuckin' with McDonald's
Nickel and dime broke, but dignified with high hopes
Some people shoulder the weight of the needy and make it look easy
Even though they walkin' the tight ropes
Immigrants twelve deep in one bedrooms
I'm too cool, I look at 'em like fools
Those fools combine forces and pull they resources
And guess who the new owner of the corner store is
Shit, what's stoppin me from doin that?
I probably could, rich drug smugglers are proof of that
Because if one dime sack in the time can climax
Into a billion dollar industry, then look at my abilities
But I'm a dreamer in a lot of ways
I feel if you believe in God, then you believe in brighter days
Keep my son's heartbeat in my sleep
I'mma walk the planet Earth with his name carved deep in my feet like

Children growin', women producin'
Men go workin', but what's the use
When the real strive hard and stress about the rent
And can still die poor and in debt without a cent

Born again Christian preachers from the suburbs
Tryin to save souls on Broadway, they got some nerve
Comin' here, unaware that the ones with no material gifts
Sometimes the most spiritually rich
Laziness got me scared the stand back and notice that
That can't hold me back, my man Vast told me that
""Harlem got all that on a bigger scale""
But when there's bullets in the sandbox, it's every bit as real
I see children growing up within a wicked system
Smiling, I wanna kiss 'em, I see prophet Muhammad in 'em
Poverty stricken, people from my generation are
Hands down the world's most creative
I've seen both sides of the fence
Picket a chain link and we ain't all thinkin' the same thing
But they teens got so impressed by me
They try to walk, talk, interact and dress like me
We captivated the world's imagination
I used to idolize athletes and entertainers
'Cause they never let the situation capture 'em
System gave 'em lemons, made lemonade and sold it back to 'em

Children growin, women producin
Men go workin, but what's the use
When the real strive hard and stress about the rent
And can still die poor and in debt without a cent

Marvin Gaye said it best ""This ain't livin""
No matter your religion the earth keep spinnin
And the sun keep shinin, babies keep cryin
Old folks dying, in between you put your time in
And here I am, still lower class America
Same room, same view, different cast of characters
Regina got arrested as a late prowler
Couldn't trick, got evicted, lost her section 8 voucher
Onward goes my neighbourhood's revolving door
A gang of rental properties nobody owns at all
I guess that's why we call it a hood
Nobody stays as long as it takes to become neighbour

Children growin, women producin
Men go workin, but what's the use
When the real strive hard and stress about the rent
And can still die poor and in debt without a cent",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-chain-link-lyrics
Sleepwalker,Champion EP,2004,"I do not have any memory of peaceful sleep
Feels like I read about it in a novel once
I believe that all the little secrets people keep
When you drop your guard, and slumber, they come out and front
I crush to sleep for nothing, I'm left to beat the sun
And my breath, they keep it rushing, my chest, with deep percussion
If death and sleep are cousins, then justice is disgusting
We'll probably be cellmates behind Hell's gates
The devil lives inside my eyelids
When I close them I hit rising violence, I'm supposed to find some silence
Rockin' the back seat of insomniac theatre
With the answers in the subtitles, I just can't read em
I'm right where the fears at, fighting the tears back
Trying to catch my balance on life before the piers crack
I hear that, hate slammin my own little prison
I declare that, ?hate band?, my soul didn't listen
So I stare at, the crack in the ceiling until the earth go twistin
Glare at, that little feeling that I've been burdened with, its turbulant
Only you and I know that the hurt exists
Everyone else just see the surfaces

Somebody tell my mother that I died
Somebody tell my mother that I died
Somebody tell my mother that I died
Somebody tell my mother that I

I can only hope that, when I wake up at night in cold sweats
That you're suffering and miserable in your own bed
I pray I haunt you the way you haunt me
The way I feel I never want to see you walk free
I hope your thoughts will burn as you toss and squirm
And curse your life, feeling like you lost your turn
And I pray that I haunt you the way you haunt me
The way I feel I never want to see you walk free
I can only hope that, when I wake up at night in cold sweats
That you're suffering and miserable in your own bed
I pray I haunt you the way you haunt me
The way I feel I never want to see you walk free
I hope your thoughts will burn as you toss and squirm
And curse your life, feeling like you lost your turn
And I pray that I haunt you the way you haunt me
The way I feel I never want to see you walk free
Fuck you Ali!

Waheedah’s Hands,Champion EP,2004,"Damn Brother what's wrong with you
I think that somebody as strong as you
Should have a better memory for what it was that brought you through
I know it's hard for you to discard what's carved in you
And I don't think that's what it is I need to talk to you
I'm not a hypocrite, I just forget
And right now, the shit I'm livin' with has got me in the thick of it
I'm strugglin'
I can feel my knees bucklin'
But all that sufferin' never made my faith muscles thin
My defense mechanism is inaction
My whole outside world is a distraction
I lose track of what day and week it is
And I forget about is my family of believers
But I with them for ten years and they raised me
It pains me that they ain't been seeing my face lately
My daily prayin' is damn near a special occasion
As a human I neglected my station

Ooh child
Say why
Ooh child
Say why
From his hands
Clappin' church on Sunday mornin'
From his hands
You stay here I don't want it
Say, baby don't you run so fast
Might pound on a piece of glass
Put yourself in Jesus' hands
C'mon sang

Nineteen years old I used to preach to the people and
Teach they children that God's voice was deep within
Travel overseas learning how to live and breath
What I believe ain't waterin' my seeds child
I carried my head all off balance
Too spiritual to develop raw talents
That Brother walk around with his head in the clouds
Till real life came and punched him dead in the mouth
Brought him out there no where near prepared
Not secure enough to admit he was scared
So he flipped the scene
But he
Still extreme
And the only thing that changed is his Yang became Ying
Changed in the place where the ?Juma? resumed
While he tried to get his crew out the Room With A View
Those old ladies words still ingrained in his brain
When he prays he remembers their names
Please Allah don't let my heart get heart get too far gone
Or let me die while I'm riding out the groove that I'm on
It's goes Hebrew",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-waheedahs-hands-lyrics
Not a Day Goes By,Left In The Deck,2013,"Alright 6 A.M., let’s see what’s up

Not a, not a, not a damn day goes by
Somebody’s hands ain't waving high inside a grey sky
They chant my name, fly: A-L-I, I’m they guy
They put me on their back and carry me when I can’t fly
Then put me in this skin, tattooed it with a pen
Lifted me in the wind to where I never would’ve been
I held a window open to my soul and snuck ‘em in
They loved me like a trusted friend ‘til I come again
I’m in the city puttin’ fan before the fame
With a cannonball and chain spitting aerosol flames — dope
Such a paradox, strange
I’m prepared to cause change, but can I say that I’m all sane? No
They told me that the top’s kinda lonely
So I stopped climbing for, thought y’all might wanna hold me — hey
Turns out I already got a category, with a slot all to my lonely
God been guardin’ this spot just for me, babe

When the motherfuckin’ beat comin’ back again
I can breathe real deep, get a second wind
Don’t hate what a veteran already did
But I’m just tryin’ to peep what the lesson is
And the message is you will never get
More or less than the sweat and tears you invest in it
‘less you sit and rest a bit, the more blessed you get
And the best deception is that success is effortless
Trust me though it never is, let me give that more emphasis
Get up off your ass, go do some work
Ain't no reward without movement first
If you not really tryin’ to prove your worth
Quit suckin’ life out the universe

Motherfuckers want something for free
It's never gonna be, not from me
This here lane is my property
And it’s all Ali, monopoly
And obviously I believe in charity and modesty
But everything my half blind eyes can see by decree belongs to me!
I don’t even rap like that, I’m sorry y'all heard me snap like that
Let me just (*breath*) take a deep breath and get myself right back on track
I love you guys, I just want y'all to see the truth about it
If you don’t love yourself ain't nothing I can do about it!
This game polluted, crowded, human garbage oozing out it
Bunch of dudes in a stupid outfit
Trying to call their group a movement — stop it
Old school dudes who ain't poppin'
Hate to see your venue get crowded
Ain't my fault that you ain't inspired
No, you wanna see who can boo the loudest
But then there’s so much amazingness that I can't resist it
It's not that ain't nobody making it, but they ain't listening
At age 6 I grabbed a brush and started painting pictures
Grabbed the mic and looked at God and said “okay, hit it!”",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-not-a-day-goes-by-lyrics
Dial Tone,Left In The Deck,2013,"Ladies and Gentlemen
On the piano tonight, to my left, your right
Is Jake One
And I am...

Big, bad, body rocking, failure is not an option
I been grinding 9 to 5 like Dolly Parton
Art for talking, make them lean like oxycontin
Not for nothing but the dream sequence kind of vibrant
No, I'm not a prophet nor am I proselytizing
My assignment, to take my little light and shine it
They can not define it so they want to water it down
Got to colonize ground and commodify it
Put you on a diet of this honest pious
Modest live wire writer piping loud enough to start a riot
Heart of a lion, both eyes open wide
Soul in overdrive, you duly notified
Bonafide North Side, alma mater
Yeah, my momma might have got us out of there
Still though my heat is near
Home base Mosque is there, took my Shahada there
When I'm out of here, I swear to God I drop a tear
Nothing is new under the sun
And so I'm doing what's been done
By those who trooped though and proved it can be won
Truth is that these musicians grew me as their son
So you're a philosopher, my uzi weighs a ton
The fluid native tongue, the true creative hum drum
Blessed it in that melting pot, the two became as one
Recognize an old soul with new school influences
Soothing music oozes through him like he blew a kiss
Jinn really do exist, I submit the proof is this
Truth is the broken heart is harder than the human fist
I'm too committed for that superficial foolishness
Got to wear the shoe that fits even if it's a crucifix
Wallace you are truly missed, pardon all your human sins
My douer is you living the garden and it's purely bliss
We still bear the fruit of his Houda that was beauty kissed
Before Gabriel pick up that horn up and play that tune of his
You won't let the humans live, let the humans love
Let us never dictate who is below and who is above
Let he who lives without sin cast the first stone
Most high hung up the phone, hear the dial tone",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-dial-tone-lyrics
Grandma And Them,Left In The Deck,2013,"Ran up in the liquor store, waving the pistol 'round
Everybody hit the floor, everybody hit the ground
Both of them in the zone, all about the business now
If they can stick to code they can hit it and get out
Oh, so professional, cleaner than a basset hound
Dog when his dick is broke, run it like a give a go
Did it before, just to get him some dough
Stash box getting too low, they inching for more
Out here kicking doors, twenty inches of snow
Fifty below, pistol grip is frigid and cold
Forever they been going through this rigmarole
Getting locked up, grandma bring him some dough
Put her house up so they let him come home
Oh, so grown

Two twin brothers raised by their grandmother
One was always running and gunning and caused trouble
The other one suffer cause they look like one another
He wasn't doing nothing, but the fuzz still bust him
He must have grew accustomed to the boys trying to rush him
One day he had enough and said fuck it
So baby now it's on, little brother ride along
One was the brain other the brawn and they twice as strong
They thinking if it's right or it's wrong
One heist the alarm, other nice with the arms
You make a move and act shiesty and you're gone
He never pulled a trigger in life, but be warned
He cold as stone and bad to the bone
Let's get it on

He started out buying shit, trying to have the flyest fits
Rocking all the brightest kicks, knocking all the hottest chicks
Driving a shiny whip, buy all the drinks
That was the old brothers thing, the little brother digs
The excitement side of it, trying to out smart a Vic
It was the lick until their grandmother got sick
She needed surgery and it hurts to see her
If they don't act first something worse could occur
Might lose a leg, suffer a seizure
Emergency might cover her up with dirt
Can't suffer to hurt, put something in her purse
And so they urgently burst into work
We gonna bleed this city like a thirst
Our gift is your curse

Back to the here and now, we don't have a lot of time
Cash drawer clear it out, hand over the dollar signs
And feel free to sound the alarm all you want
We already downed the phone and the power lines
And I really doubt you want to step out of line
This Glock 9 of mine will make your mind hard to find
Ignorant, the only sound I want to be hearing is
The lock on the safe go click-ickity-click
This is a bad feeling isn't it? Yeah, listen, bitch
Here is bag, get to filling it
Lady moved kind of slow like she forgot the code
Younger brother watch the clock, ""yo, it's time to go""
He ain't leaving out this door without this pot of gold
Lock and load

The old owner's down stairs doing invoices
Seen the power go out, and he could hear noises
Knew what was taking place and had a little something
Of his own waiting for this situation
He came out bummages to show them what time it is
The guns are kind of big, but one ain't ever fired his
Aim ain't confident plus he got the power kick
Hitting all kind of shit except of what the target is
But old papa did just the opposite
Shots just ricocheting, ""listen mister, isn't playing""
Kids made it out the spot, but he followed them
Nines still firing, sirens hollering
Police arrive and the younger twin dropped just then
The owner hit him in the collar and bodied him
Kemosabe isn't stopping
Continued throwing shots at the cops until the officers slaughter him
Damn, now who's suppose to tell grandma and them?",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-grandma-and-them-lyrics
Rapper Thing,Left In The Deck,2013,"Everywhere I go I'm trying to do my rapper thing
I run into a crew of dudes that want to do the same
Well, listen closely, I'mma give you some game
How to get your thing together right and get you a name
The first rule is you gotta be you to the upmost
Bring the listener to your world and pull 'em up close
Let us see how it feels to be in your shoes
Take the journey that you're on, see what you go through
What is it about you that makes you different?
And what about your story makes it interesting?
Can you really make me feel it when I'm listening?
Cause if not then ain't nobody trying to give a shit
There's a lot better ways of making money
So if that's why you're here quit now, take it from me
The first decade or so is gonna be hard
So the work in itself is gotta be the reward
If there's something you could be doing, boy, you probably should
Shit is not how they make it seem in Hollywood
But if you can't sleep at night cause your ass gotta write
Just to feel right, then it'll all be good

Please listen to my demo
I gotta kick a little shit to let my friends know
Never let go, live out your dream
Just know that nothing in life is what it seems
Please, please listen to my demo
I gotta kick a little shit to let my friends know
Never let go, live out your dream
Just know that it's not

They call it show business, should've called it business show
It's a business first, ain't that how that saying go?
I say nevermind that shit, just let it grow
Brother, use your common sense and go for what you know
The most important relationship you have
Is between you and your craft, don't ever forget that
Business only matters when your ass is in demand
Your success depends on your connection with your fans
And if you plan on taking money from their hands
You better give them as much in return as you can
Give 'em albums they can listen to for years
Give 'em great live shows, give 'em blood, sweat and tears
I'm not saying these folk won't try to play you
But you stay true, you don't need them to embrace you
Embrace yourself, but then brace yourself
Cause you're gon' be staring in the face of hate itself
Can't get distracted with that kind of shit
Cause fans decide who the real headliner is
If you can't get something without being a bastard
You have to ask yourself if that's really worth having, man


It took like 15 years for me to get what I want
But that time would've passed wether I was trying or not
So what's a fella to do?
Your life is gonna be what you dedicate it to
So everytime we celebrate something new
It opens new doors that we get to pressure through
I guess I knew with every level I grew
I expect more from me than I'd ever expect from you
Your work is a reflection of you
So put your whole ass in everything that you do
This is your life, gotta live it your way
And then you gotta let them chips fall where they lay, my man",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-rapper-thing-lyrics
Phantom Of The Opera,Left In The Deck,2013,"Phantom of the opera, champion author
Channeling the heart of the Ansar Sahaba
Reincarnated Black Panther spitting lava
Passionate, empowering, and the stare of Che Guevara
Answering the prophets in the last days and hours
Casualties of war, no one's guaranteed tomorrow
Ink of the scholar, trump blood of the martyr
Chose to flow both the whole globe is a altar
Upright, honorable, obelisk posture
Bent backs offer resting in spots for the vultures
Modern chip of the old rock of Gibraltar
Incarcerated thoughts, idiot savant philosopher

Highly regarded, wildly accomplished
Been bowed down before on six continents
Travel at the speed of sound and get nauseous
Just to catch shadows in the darkness

Uncut, never refined, so genuine
Upper echelon like the sun arrived ahead of time
Credit the divine, testify the blessings everytime
Scribble down the message every record that he tend to sign
Push this pen of mine to the end of the line
Camera lenses never could define my impeccable shine
Love, evidence of the intelligent design
With the evolutionary mind, the kind you seldom find
Gentleman, endowed with a legendary grind
Work ethic is inspired by the pyramids design
The rhetoric will refine to the level of the time
This expression so you catch a Duke Ellington's vibe


The name of the Lord Sustainer, Evolver, Raiser
All systems knowledge creator
Embrace the awesome, all-seeing author of nature
Artistic shaper of all small and major
The cradle maker, the life giver and taker
God, displayer of the garden I was placed in
My arrival was described to the angels
Self-determination was clocked in my nature
Born blind in a world full of hatred
Saved by the blank preservation I came in
Outside the matrix was my presentation
Faithfully laying on my face, prostrating
Broadcasted live from the obelisk invasion
Lost in the haze of the forced occupation
Cradled by the love of oppressed peoples pain
I busted out the chain and it has never been the same",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-phantom-of-the-opera-lyrics
Well Okay,Left In The Deck,2013,"Drowning in some kind of rut, grinding, trying to find a buck
Time was up, was out of luck, I was kinda stuck
Eyes wide swollen shut, it's when you're lucky enough
To duck a sucker punch, slip up and catch a upper cut
Crack heads, junkies, and drunks, mugger first
Glad I'm up, come to run 'em up 'till the sun come up
Kids don't run or jump, Hopscotch Double Dutch
Corners of they mouth down, frowning, here come the bust
My head is always up, I was told as such
Cry forever and a day it won't be long enough
Had to get my timing up, refine, shine it up
Gotta find a diamond in the rough, mine's I can strut
A rails solid up, I can bust, destruct
Better get it right, 'fore the pipes decide to bust
But the sun keep shining, the Earth keep turning
And the beats keep banging away, so okay
Married as a seventeen year old
Nobody had the guts to tell me ""you ain't even grown""
She ain't love me, she just didn't want to be alone
But I ain't love her, I just love feeling needed so
I guess we're even, yo,
 turn out she was silly, though
I'm talking messed up in the head like I ain't seen before
Argued every single day, she was screaming flow
Things around the crib with us that aren't leaving, ho
We had a kid, he wasn't even three months old
She would leave him home, alone, only God know how long she'd be gone
Didn't know where we would go, you're coming with daddy now
Happy now, leaving though we sleep on the floor
Here she go, blew her top, 'round my baby boy watch
She socked my in the eye, in the mosque

Digital Age,Left In The Deck,2013,"Living in a time where life is cyber
You the type to think that everything you pry is your two cents up in a cypher
You just need to quietly admire my desire
Get inspired by a higher form of life or just retire
A riot's only fire, it's the ingredients inside of you
Wood you, tiger I'm Mike Tyson, I'm iron
Meaning you say you would, when I only say that I am
And my universe is only too adverse, there's no trying
Sci-fi pioneering, scientific tie-in
A falsified environment, you save your life with a right click
You dogs high and mindless on the mic and when I'm lying
You can stop me then, you're not even excited to recite it

Worlds colliding, your rhetoric is silly
And I ain't hustling, I'm building, ain't a thing that's built quickly
Could only be, dim see, 
you could dress it up pretty
But a weak foundation, I could break you with my pinkie
Sniffing up all the blow, getting your body swole
But I look inside your eyes and I can know your hallowed soul
Lying to yourself from the moment you press go
You brought it on your own, you're only known for what you own, yah
Chain is gorgeous, but you didn't make it
And your drugs are flawless, but you didn't create it
Then your clothes are immaculate, but you were born naked
We all die, our legacy the only thing we take with

Listen now, we're living through this digital age
Even though you ain't locked up in no physical cage
Still gon' need to see your way all through that mental maze
Each new innovation puts us deep inside a case
Picked up all the scriptures and I flipped through every page
Looking for some proof that these are not the end of days
Every single sacred relevation's been displayed
Only thing that ain't been happened yet, the dead have not been raised
You forever passing, 'til my paths are made of passion
My intoxicated, toxic break your thoughts you couldn't fathom
You gon' get the gat , you earned it, up up and at 'em
Like the first man on that planet, out the bad shit that done happened

I'm doing really really well, living in a minute in hell, like it's a citadel
Where the million listeners under my spell, so they couldn't even tell
Anytime the ignorant prevail, I skip bail and and end up tipping the scale
That rude truth still get telled, keep on lifting up, prevail
My soul, too gold, too broad to fail and it isn't for sale
Even with the pressure to prevail, I shall not crack like the Liberty Bell
And in the days and months to come, I say it once so listen up well
Y'all are selling nature heaven for a digital hell",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-digital-age-lyrics
Never Stoppin’,Left In The Deck,2013,"No, no, no
No, I'll never stop
No, I'll never stop
No, I'll never stop
Just keep coming for more
No, no, no
No, I'll never stop
No, I'll never stop
No, I'll never stop
Just keep coming for more

Can't stop the rock, I won't cease in the least
Won't quit for shit, that pause, but never peace
Neighborhood respect, I'm awesome in the streets
Beast on the beats when y'all were peeing in sheets
No toys for Christmas, I just want equipment
Y'all were in the mix, I was at the crib mixing
You at the dance dancing, I'm at the dance spitting
Now I'm globe traveling, y'all at home chilling
I was in the beats in the books and in the zone
You were in the mirror just drowning in cologne
Same corny cliques since 16 years old
You still doing high school shit, you just old
Got a couple babies, I'm raising and educating 'em
Take them on planes and train them in foreign languages
You were rolling stone, escaping and not claiming them
Bitch, you ain't grown, you too lazy to pay for them
Rocked every fan, from basements to stadiums
All of them slammed, the small joints my favorite
Even when I'm old and they say I fell off
Shit might slow, but never shall it stop


Something about him when he taught me never doubt him
Music get to pounding on that juke to fall up out it
No doubt about it, he better every album
Heavy metal, weaponry flow, steadily growling
Don't matter how many doubters that crowd around him
Love to be surrounded, like the sun when it's cloudy
Let him live a minute to fuck him, he start to shinin'
Let him just tumble to the ground and keep drowning
Never did I desire to make it rain dollars
Make some poor father's naked daughter excited
Plenty fine dimes inspired to bare body
Respond to the high power rhymes I recited
Never believed I needed smoke to catch fire
Or drink fire water just to get electrified
The breath of God that's within, it gets me high
When it's vibrating in me, deliver me to the sky


How the hell I stop what I don't remember starting?
Popped out my mamma singing ''Get Retarded''
Kane was my poppa, Pharoahe Monch my older brother
Cube was my cool ass uncle from California
When I got to school I was 'ju-a-jumping' on it
KRS One, Chuck D gave me assignments
If I said I lost it they would send me to the office
Had to see the Principal, Dr. Bambaataa
On that hip hop and I graduated with honors
Atmosphere tour warm up slot, that was my college
Master ceremony job because I rocked it
Finally got my doctorate when I started headlining
Long as the human beatbox keep knocking
Yes, that's my heart - no, I'll never stop
When they put me in the ground and everybody start sobbing
Somebody drive by with the ''Shadows On The Sun'' pounding",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-never-stoppin-lyrics
Devil’s Arms,Left In The Deck,2013,"Said the devil got his arms around you
In the spot where the love ain't found you
It's so weak, but it's so dang powerful
I'd pull you out, but I don't know how to

My daddy on that medicine
I guess the demons are dancing in his head again
Many women tried to breeze through and rescue him
What they all seem to see
Trying to get a thin screen between you and your agony
Strangling your anger 'til it settles at apathy
Have you seeing scenes that nobody should have to see
Shadowy screams of your own humanity
I feel the melancholy moan of a troubled soul
That somehow could never know that it weren't alone
If he took a swig of gin, it would always grip him in
And he'd sink until he drowned in that undertow
Till the day he sat and scribbled out that rugged note
Said ""everything I ever touched, it went up in smoke.""
Apologized to his woman, didn't know her heart
Doesn't love any less pure just because it's broke


You better tell them you love them and make them believe you
Get between your people and that needle before they leave you
Tell them something when you look them in the eye
Before you can't say nothing but goodbye

Said the devil got his arms around you",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-devils-arms-lyrics
Steerange,Left In The Deck,2013,"It's time to get 'em, it's time, time to get 'em
My vibe got to killing, my eyes start to glisten
I ride the rhythm with signs like precision
Right arm got to swinging, the highlight division
In my mind I'm hearing the gospel choir singing
I could not fight the feeling, I find it mighty thrilling
The crowds start shifting, the broads get to gigging
Their body parts wiggling, my kind of women
Especially when they thick and pop all out the Denim
It's really not a sin to admire what God give 'em
I know my wife listening, come on, I'm only kidding
I can find a lot iller way to grind at the living
Don't think for not a minute that I forgot about my children
Their little tummies is rumbling and I got to fill 'em
I'm all about my business, sock 'em out if I'mma spitting
It's kind of hard to fit it, my saga systems
But I don't give a shit, my shows are hella intimate
If you guys are a band, then where the hell are all your instruments
Interesting, holla at the maid in D
Pull something out the seat and season them up for me
He asking my staff ''what's happening with your captain?
He look like Gene Hackman and talk like Mars Blackmon''
Lobby at the W, the hotel was cracking
I took off my jacket and called it a backspin

Let it be known I love all of my fans
A lot of y'all are making water and they washing your hands
Got a big box of vinyls, signed them all in advance
So don't get off me with your slovenly ass and don't bother me
I dress sharp like Dapper Dan
Big white beard looking something like the Santa band
The Kentucky Fried Chicken man
Cush me like a pimp, said he had a biscuit in his hand
So strange and I must admit
Don't know what stranger shit it is, but I'm full of it
I be that dude in my 80's still trying to spit
You be saying ''yo, yo, I almost made it'', but you should've quit
Till then I'm in the rain with some other men
Riding on the train, tuxedo and some runner kicks
I ain't paying out nothing to the government
'Til somebody run Biz Markie for president",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-steerange-lyrics
Mourning in America,Mourning in America and Dreaming in Color,2012,"I don’t usually use those big words
Cause I don’t usually deal with big people
I find you can get a whole lot of small people
And whip hell out of a whole lot of big people

Murder murder murder kill kill kill
Cannibals walk the earth and get ill blood spill
Eyes sunk deep in their skull their bone chill
Few for survival most for the thrill
Terrorism is the war of the poor
Hold up a mirror so the script get flipped
Cause when it’s in reverse it ain’t wrong no more
Warfare’s the terrorism of the rich
Who’s the true guerilla
When the bomb on your body killing innocent civilians
But a life is a life and a killer is a killer
You’re at a desk chillin’ push a button kill a million
See the anguish of the parents
When they’re carrying the body of the baby that they cherish
When innocent people perish
It’s a very thin line between a soldier and a terrorist

Murder murder kill kill kill
Death and destruction a cap get pealed
Harm or heal destroy and rebuild
Shots still ring out and blood still spill

Overseas we can mutilate and mangle
Let me give you an example what our troops are coming back to
Cold cities where the youth are getting strangled
The community in peril and our future looking narrow
Your school already failed you
The boys in blue will nail you they salute you with a barrel
The streets are a certified dead zone
Decorated with chalk lines and headstones
All the way live and every night the bullets flying
Even if you ain’t dying you a traumatized survivor
When you grow up in a climate of overriding violence
You will never get beyond it it’ll always alive inside you
And death just surrounds you
Fallen classmates’ ghosts haunt you
Crime just calls you cause you look at what you walk through
Ain’t certain if you’ll make it ain’t sure you even want to

Murder murder kill kill kill
Death and destruction a cap get pealed
Harm or heal destroy and rebuild
Shots still ring out and blood still spill

Murder murder kill kill kill
Death and destruction a cap get pealed
Harm or heal destroy and rebuild
Shots still ring out and blood still spill

Tears and sorrow block the sunlight
Head low heart broke eyes closed
 
tongue-tied
Waters raise the tide is climbing
Speeding time the sky is crying
Shots are fired bombs and sirens
War and riots mourning in America

Now that society forgot you
And they locked you in an obstacle course where nothing’s possible
If you slip up and they caught you
They got boxes where they lock you make a million dollars off you
They rule you too rude to school
They screw you in a booth shoot electricity through you
Or inject death into you
On a television set and let it ooze through you
Every time a leader tries to stand up for our freedom
Someone claps them with the heater their brain and back leaking
A shame their family grieving the only way to see them
Is a displaced dream displayed in a museum
They say they built our nation for a reason
Then they stained it with the bleeding of the slaves that never seen it
I ain’t hating I still want to believe it
And I’m not trying to leave it I just call it how I see it

Murder murder kill kill kill
Death and destruction a cap get pealed
Harm or heal destroy and rebuild
Shots still ring out and blood still spill
They haven’t got anything to lose
And they’ve got everything to gain
And they’ll let you know in a minute
It takes two to tango. When I go, you go",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-mourning-in-america-lyrics
Work Everyday,Mourning in America and Dreaming in Color,2012,"Damn, man. I’m broker than an old VCR, man. I need a job
Are they hiring at your job?
I got a stack of red bills at my house. It looks like Valentine’s Day at the crib
My kids are eating left-over leftovers, man. I can’t fool them no more. It’s job time

Every day every day
Got to work every day
Every day every day
Got to work every day

My God there’s got to be more to life than this
There’s got to be a bigger reason that I exist
Work to eat to earn my keep
To ensure somewhere to sleep and spend the weekend buying shit
Don’t need economists to know I need pot to piss
Follow politics man I ain’t got time to think
What I got to set aside for my retirement
Cop a double shift pay somebody to watch the kids
Sick of all this but can’t take an off day
Doctor’s office I can’t swing the co pay
Trapped in a network, lucky just to get work
They celebrate every week nobody gets hurt
Greed could never leave well enough alone
They keep on squeezing till we bleed from every bone
And we’ll strive hard and stress about the rent
Probably still die poor and in debt without a cent but

I guess I’ll carry my ass down to the county and see what they’re talking about. But
You know they treat you like you shot somebody just because you need a little help

You’re telling me you ain’t never been down on your luck
Never tried to make them ends meet but just got stuck
Never slaved at a gig like a bum with a cup
Added all your pennies up and you still ain’t had enough
And the jobs full up they ain’t hiring
I’m barely surviving not enough to get by with
Hunger is a constant problem stomach steady growling
People getting shot in my environment
Study go to college is what them people hollering
Too many road blocks in the way its not an option
To say that its impossible I would be lying
But you ain’t got a chance if you’re not up in that top ten
A couple got a scholarship but I am not them
Ain’t got the skills to pay the bills so my pockets are thin
So until I cop a gig and my hardship ends
Fixing to line my self up at your welfare office again
And I expect to be accepted as the man that I am
Respectfully and appreciatively Ma’am
God damn you must be out of your mind

Do you see this Tea Party stuff, man? Them people look broke their damn self. Are they serious?

People stressing here’s the question
How they get people drinking tea in a recession?
It’s deception how absurd is this
How are so many poor people conservative?
A pro artist, I put it in the good music
A con artist job’s to make you look stupid
Lookie here I’ll teach you how to look through it
First thing you need to know every con got a hook to it
They seduce you with a little wealth
Say you could have some of these crumbs for yourself
If the government doesn’t make us help anyone else
You stuck a red sign on your foreclosed house
Make you think you’re taking back your nation
Then they turn it over to a major corporation
Those companies took the jobs overseas
And you handed them the wallet out your pocket for free
You’re staring in the sky with dollar signs for eyes
The blind right wing of a bird that can’t fly
Just a peacock with a poked out gut
Who’s too fat to fly so his ass just strut but

They’re so criminal minded we’ve been blinded
Looking for an honest job and can’t find it
They got a job bill we got a light bill
If we don’t pay ours our life is quite real",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-work-everyday-lyrics
My Beloved,Mourning in America and Dreaming in Color,2012,"Hold your moments

Faith in God, high thinking and simple living
Work hard, deep love, no conditions
Gentle heart, head level, clear vision
Back tall, firm in our conviction
Smile through the tears laugh through the tragedy
All we got is each other must love radically
Passionately peaceful fight for it fanatically
Premium on people magic humanity
Dance as if no one’s looking, sing like no one’s listening
Live and love out loud and let your spirit glisten
Feet firm in the dirt head in the sky
Serve when the sun is at work dream when he hides
And know that the water that well up in your eye
Is the same when a loved one is born as when they die
As sure as every hello is eventually goodbye
The art of truly living is learning how to die

Wherever you go
May the good lord bless your heart and soul
My beloved my beloved my beloved
I want you to know
That your love and your wisdom touched me so
My beloved my beloved my beloved

Bless your soul so precious and delicate
Powerfully compassionate, your friendship
Held me together when the threat of unraveling
Had me at the brink feeling inadequate
When the sky got dreary my eyes got teary, my
Heart got weary you were right there near me
Only reason I ain’t laid up in some cemetery
Is when I was in fear somebody cared enough to hear me
Anything that I do in this life of mine
From this point is part you for the gifts you provide
Only way to repay you is live right and shine
Trust me when I tell you you’re still on my mind


Young lovers passion in their stare
Hanging in the air challenging their fears
Catch a passing moment and grab it in the clear
Desperately attempting to stretch it into years
Her soft and elegant he firm and gallant
Words dancing between them hanging in the balance
Grins and glances translate every sentence
Into a language where the future smiles at us
Love’s not careful neither is it fearful
The thought of living without is unbearable
So listen young lady this me thanking you
No matter what you will always have my gratitude",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-my-beloved-lyrics
Only Life I Know,Mourning in America and Dreaming in Color,2012,"(It's my life)
Yeah, the only one that I'll ever know
Feeling extra low
Please let me go
Oh Lord, no
(It's my life)
Yeah, the only that I'll ever know
And it stressed me so
Oh God, bless me soul
Oh Lord

Whether it's the projects or a trailer park mess
Raggedy the apartment complex
With a stressed out single mom sitting on the steps
Waiting on the mailman, looking for a check
Boys on the corner, pushing out the chest
Questing for anything that resembles respect
Young girls swinging their hair with every step
Looking for affection, settling for sex
Bodies decorated with tattoos and chains
Trying to put armor between you and pain
Wood grain steering wheel, the bass bang
But not enough to drown out the hatred in your brain
The only out is smoking out
Get lean, get wet, get meth, get tore down
Cause who the hell would want to stick around?
Put me in a haze, I ain't never coming out


They just wanna get you in the system, stick you into prison
List you in the military ship you to the desert
Gigs don't exist for you to make a decent living
But we got three illegal wars that you can pick from
Keep stressing morals and personal decisions
Tell me what's moral about these conditions
Who decided you don't got enough to teach children?
State spending billions, on stadiums and prisons
How many routes can folks really choose?
When you're oppressed only three lead to you
First one is follow the rules and stay in school
Be the square dude, that society approves
Get a little job or a shitty appartment
Sub-prime mortgage in a failing house market
The after your life dedication and hardship
You died just as poor as you was when you started
Fuck that, what's up with the second option?
You could always hit the corner and try to get it popping
Get fast guap when you're out dropping and clocking
But, chances are that you'll probably die violent
The best hope that you got is getting locked
And end up with a job in a prison metal shop
They ain't paying nothing but three hots and a cot -- shit
Don't you know that's the biggest hustle they got?
Or door three you can get on that welfare
But they ain't trying to help, they'll put you in hell there
Give you just enough so you're not gonna starve
And constantly harass you while you're looking for a job
Do luck up and someone that got you to punch a clock
And they found about it and your check is getting docked
Can't win for losing, dehumanizing
You'll never get caught up, you caught up in a cycle",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-only-life-i-know-lyrics
Letter To My Countrymen,Mourning in America and Dreaming in Color,2012,"""Sooner or later""
:
I used to think I hated this place
Couldn't wait to tell the president straight to his face
But lately I changed, nowadays I embrace it all
Beautiful ideals and amazing flaws
Got to care enough to give a testament'
Bout the deeply depressing mess we're in
It's home so we better make the best of it
I wanna make this country what it says it is
Still dream in the vividest living color
No matter how many times my love been smothered
Who's ever above us won't just let us suffer
All of this struggling got to amount to something
This is a letter to my countrymen
Especially those my age and younger than
We're up against an ugly trend
Everybody's hustling, don't nobody touch their friends
No group singing and dancing
No anthem nobody holds hands, and...
Instead they give you a handheld
And make you shoulder life's burden by your damn self
One thing that can't be debated
Power never changed on it's own you got to make it
That's why community is so sacred
That's the symbol that we make when we raise fists
Chorus: ""Sooner or later""
:
We don't really like to talk about the race thing
The whole grandparents used to own slaves thing
Pat ourselves on the back in February
Looking at pictures of Abe Lincoln and the great King
But the real picture's much more embarrassing
We're still not even close to really sharing things
The situation of oppressed people
Shows what we feel it means to be a human being
What does it mean to be American?
I think the struggle to be free is our inheritance
And if we say it how it really is
We know our lily skin still give us privilege
Advantage is given to the few
That are built into the roots of our biggest institutions
That's the truth in life we got to choose
Do I fight in the movement or think I'm entitled to it
This is not a practice life
This is the big game we got to attack it right
Each one of us is headed for the grave
This old crooked world won't be saved by the passive type
This is a letter to my countrymen
Not from a Democrat or a Republican
But one among ya
That's why you call me Brother
Ain't scared to tell you we're in trouble cause I love you
Chorus:""Sooner or later""
:
They tell me I'm a dreamer, they ridicule
They feel defeated, old, bitter, and cynical
Excuse me but I see it from a different view
I still believe in what a driven few could really do
I know that the masses want to sleep
And they would just rather hear me rapping to the beat
But I want to pass this planet to my son
A little better than it was when they handed it to me
So
I wrote a letter to my countrymen
I'll be happy if it only reaches one of them
Reporting live A-L-I, your brother
Mourning in America, dreaming in color
:
My dear Brother Ali,I think you know deep down in your soul that something, something just ain't right.You don't want to be just well adjusted to injustice and well adapted to indifference. You want to be a person with integrity who leaves a mark on the world.People can say when you go that you left the world just a little better than you found it. I understand. I want to be like that too",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-letter-to-my-countrymen-lyrics
Stop the Press,Mourning in America and Dreaming in Color,2012,"Another one of them long ass breaks. Damn, Brother Ali where the hell you been? What, you disappear?
Stop the presses give me couple seconds
Let me tell my friends what’s up with big brethren
New year new beard a new record
Made a few adjustments I want to discuss it
In a life of pain and sadness
Never would’ve guessed that a taste of success
Would’ve been the first time I ever got depressed
I know I’m blessed I just couldn’t adjust
In life all I ever knew how to do is fight
Scrapped on the playground fighting for the mic
Trying to build a life with an insane wife
Fighting for a little bit of time in the light
Then I got a daughter a car and house
No one left to fight with but myself
Gained a lot of weight wasn’t thinking about my health
Maybe the music I’m making could help
I can’t drive ‘cause this albino shit
Told you I was legally blind that’s legit
I ain’t want 
Ant
 to have to come scoop the kid
So I bought a crib a couple blocks from his
That’s the greatest friend I ever had
Like a brother to me a borderline dad
Maybe making a record will get me on track
Help fix whatever’s wrong with my head
I jumped back in the basement at once
Made the album Us in a couple of months
But I can’t lie to y’all I felt lost
Energy I brought might’ve been a bit off
Couple great moments though of course
Babygirl Puppy Love and The Travelers
I toured two years off that album
Was on the road ten months out of one of them
Did the globe with 
my brother BK
My life coach slash DJ
Literally been with me since day one
Had a lot of hard times had a lot of fun
Long story short he got hell of a wife
Catastrophe damn near ended her life
Brought our wifeys out to Hawaii
These fuckers got pregnant on Waikiki
He said ""I need to talk to you Ali
This is what you were born to do, but not me""
So after Soundset two thousand and ten
Say goodbye to my Deejay but not my friend
My career ain’t stop it just grew
I rock(ed) the bells
 
and Glastonbury too
Close enough to smell Beyonce’s perfume
But it just ain’t the same without dude
Couldn’t slow me down no lord
Stayed on the planes and the busses and cars
Brought a young DJ into the squad
Sucker quit on me cause I toured too hard “Wahhhh”
On to the next one
Then me and Ant had trouble connecting
If I was here then he was always there
Touring or recording with Atmosphere
What the hell's goin on with my career
Within a year my team disappeared
Got a phone call on the 4th of July
My dad died, he committed suicide
Shit should've been there for him
Had to fly home from Europe to bury him
Im sorry, I need a minute
Bismillah...)
 Alright, listen
Trying to hold this marriage together
But me and my baby barely see each other
I’m in France with the fans taking pictures
She’s with the kids making dinner doing dishes
She ain’t got to worry bout me screwing other _______
But that ain’t enough to make a woman feel precious
If we don’t start to intersecting
We got no choice but grow in different directions -Damn
I got that phone call again
You know the kind you never want to get
Mikey’s mom couldn’t get a hold of him
And found him dead in his apartment
Just drowning in tears
Probably won’t get over that in all my years
I’ll remember forever
A day later boarded a plane to 
Mecca
And the next month changed my life
Listening to God in the holy sites
Inklings I had all my life
Suddenly presented themselves in plain sight
Any doubts I had about the mic
And whether or not what I write is right
Fell out of sight like the tears on the floor
Now I’m going harder than I ever did before
Got a couple of beat tapes from 
Jake
Genuine dude and his music is great
I told 
Zach
 to hold my tour dates
Roll the tape I got something to say
So, I’m gonna go make this album. Let me start it off right though",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-stop-the-press-lyrics
All You Need,Mourning in America and Dreaming in Color,2012,"So I never told the world that the first time I toured
I came home to find that little man had been ignored
Two years old got a hold of water you had boiled
And burned his little head and his face while you snored
You were afraid of bringing him to the hospital
‘Cause two weeks ago your mom called the cops on you
Child protection paid a visit
Ruled that the crib was unfit to raise kids in
I’m working ten hour days at the gig then
You were unemployed all null and void
Now I ain’t trying to be no Sigmund Freud
But ain’t you supposed to have instincts when it comes to the boy
I called a cab and took him to county hospital
They shaved hair and burnt flesh off his skull
Held him overnight to fight infection
I slept sitting up in a chair directly next to him
I just knew you would join us but instead
Hopped your ass on the bus went home and went to bed
That’s the very moment I divorced you in my head
God might forgive you for that I never did
All you need right now
Faheem we can see the throne from here
I may never sit there but brother you’re the heir
Pull up a chair let pop bend your ear
Here baby dry those tears
I know you wonder why your mother does the things that she do
Well it’s not because she doesn’t love you
It’s because she grew up in something they call foster care
That’s when strangers raise you your mom’s not there
Imagine how she felt when she was your age
Going from place to place never feeling safe
Never having love never having faith
She probably thought the world was a big scary place
Where was her mommy at well that’s kind of sad
She used drugs to forget the problems she had
There was a new one back then they called crack
Once you try it there was almost no coming back
She couldn’t be the mommy she wanted to be
She was chasing a high all in the street
Won’t tell you no lie real is all I can be
I believe only truth can set you free
There’s a whole lot of pain in your bloodline
But there’s a whole lot of strength in the sunshine
Lean back let the new day greet you
‘Cause you’re standing on the shoulders of a people
Who been beat down and treated unequal
But the prayer that they made now has reached you
It’s plain to see it’s true
Beautiful prince I wish they could see you
All you need right now",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-all-you-need-lyrics
Fajr,Mourning in America and Dreaming in Color,2012,"People ain’t eating they say the reason
Resources depleted for the defense
I’m offended by these authentic liars
Should’ve been retired let me identify them
You’ll never get me quiet my people been inspired
I’m the little fire flickering within the riot
Feel it vibrate shake awake sleeping giant
Keep them vibrant and vital and re-energize them
Our time’s arriving our shine is blinding
They cry we’re violent demonize it
Guys on the wrong side of right find us frightening
Pray lightning strike twice ice on their eyelids
Isis Osiris Christ in his likeness
Day of resurrection bring life to the lifeless
Tear the wall down pull a crown of a tyrant
Rebuild gentrify the planet for the righteous
He who sacrifices for the greater good
Elevate them where they should to the title of your highness
Only tribe surviving is the pious, pious
United by the mighty human life tie that bind us
Hunger find kindness minds find refinement
The sightless guided by the blind are the blindest
We read the signs inscribed in the horizon
Bright yellow shot through the night time fajr

Oh thank you master for my soul
Lord hold me close don’t let me go
Oh thank you master for my soul
Lord hold me close don’t let me go

The long suffering long for relief
The hard working meek still drowned in grief
Houses are seized and they tossed in the street
The orphans of greed in the culture of deceit
Strong hunt the weak and the poverty steep
Wages dropping beneath yet the cost still increase
Officers deep keep force of police
The four-headed beast wild all off the leash
Hard-hearted beast with a jaw full of meat
Engulfed in a feast while you starve at his feet
He toss you the least little portion of a piece
To the floor and expect you to rejoice when you eat
Survival can seem the impossible feat
But you roll up your sleeves and you sow all your seeds
Toil in the soil but you’re not allowed to reap
So you toss and you scream like a horrible dream
Woke out your sleep got you forced to your feet
Feel the pulse of your people in the heart when it beat
The vultures they keep bringing halt to your peace
Pull the sword out the sheath keep the wolves off of the sheep",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-fajr-lyrics
Gather Round,Mourning in America and Dreaming in Color,2012,"Ain’t no stopping the calling, I’m a warrior scholar
With the pad and the pen or with the sword and the chopper
Look at how far I got if you lost I could guide you
In between two extremes like Safa and Marwa
In the desert like Bedouins in search of water
Except we’re thirsting for power up in the urban drama
Every day our sons and daughters are led to the slaughter
Indoctrinated by a complacent social order
Decapitated they’re trying to cut our jugular vain
That’s the sacred lifeline from the heart to the brain
Make us blind to mankind’s suffering pain
Ugliness worldwide that’s done in our name
So the only thing we’re seeing is what we can gain
Precious blood shed in vain and nothing is changed
Drugged up in the daze in a comfortable maze
Upscale slaves in luxury cages

But the weak keep crying and the innocent dying
And these are the times when the real freedom fighters gather ‘round
I said the cities catch fire and the flames grow higher
And the poor and the pious get inspired and decide to gather
‘round
When the times get dire and the mighty are liars
And the righteous fighting for their life get organized and gather
‘round
When the prophets are silenced and the tyrants are giants
And David sets his sights on Goliath and we finally gather
‘round

Hostile environment locked in a conflict
Wandering lost in an impossible climate
Boxed in confinement democracy hostage
Bound for the towers monsters in the cockpit
Following blind unconscious accomplice
Judged by time indicted for our silence
Couple years ago I made a statement
Can’t figure a single Goddamn way to change it
As of late I made adjustments to my language
Numbers are the only thing the people gain strength in
If we’re going to change we got to step up our relations
Got to see our own selves in each other’s faces
Share each other’s spaces give each other room
And hear each other’s pain bare witness to the truth
And the ground gets holy when the ground is stood
And the goods may odd but the odds are good


“That is why I challenge you now to stand together. Because together we’ve got
Power and we can make decisions.”

Justice…
Is somewhere in between reading sad poems and 40 ounces of gasoline crashing
Through windows
Justice…
Is between plans and action
Between writing letters to congressmen and clapping a captain
Between raising legal defense funds and putting a gun on the bailiff and taking the
Judge captive
It is between prayer and fasting
Between burning and blasting
Freedom…
Is between the mind and the soul
It is between the lock and the load
Between the zeal of the young and the patience of the old
Freedom…
Is between the finger and the trigger
It is between the page and the pen
Between the grenade and the pin
Between righteous anger and keeping one in the chamber
So I say down with Goliath
I say down with Goliath
But we must learn, know, write, read
We must kick, bite, yell, scream
We must pray, fast, live, dream, fight, kill and die
Free",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-gather-round-lyrics

Show me the spot

I had to get paper use to move white
Did it 24/7 morning noon night
Had to hit the block early in my true life
Scraping on the concrete in the moonlight
Powerful supply got that powder from the sky
I could always get it where you want it by tonight
Love the fluffy white but I take it wet and hard
Push it off the sidewalk dump it in the yard
I’m a hustler, was cold blooded
All my customers their nose running
Got my muscles up pitching whole bundles
I ain’t selling cocaine I had a snow shovel


I use to chop green put it in a bag
Up and down the street let my money stack
They knew every week that I was coming back
No sticks kept it clean right and exact
Talking green sticky never brown crispy
Worse thing for my paper was when the drought hit me
I know my mama know because my pockets swoll
Soon as I walk through the door she smell it on my clothes
But I got to roll keep it pushing hot or cold
I gas it up I’m hitting every house on the road
Got to get it how I live I’m going hard for it
It ain’t no marijuana man I push a lawn mower


When I was sixteen I had crew of girls
Get them clean send them off out into the world
Use to come and see the kid to get their head right
Shorty talk all you want to just get my bread right
Never split the ends wasn’t nothing soft
Had to get some trim then I cut them off
You know I bend their back I kept them in them tracks
You got some new growth baby better bring them stacks
Steady go upside her head but she can’t complain
I run that same old game baby no pain no gain
You got some paper and you trying to see some cuties holler
I ain’t a pimp I’m sweeping hair up at the beauty parlor",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-need-a-knot-lyrics

Singing this song let the whole world know
Let the choir sing
Singing this song let the whole world know

Blood on our hands, it’s wetter than it ever was
We say its getting better, yet it seldom does
Everybody wanna fuss but what gets discussed
When its all said and done what will be said of us?
This is who we are not who we have to be
In the lasting aftermath of a tragedy
Don’t wanna talk no more, I heard it all before
I just know that I don’t want this on my heart no more
Speeding on a crash course with our final hour
Only thing that can bring us back is our finest hour
Excellence flow from every precious soul is the
Only way that i know to harness that kind of power
We can shine brighter, sing bigger, love louder
We can dream farther, hope harder, work smarter
This is that moment, sand flowing through the hourglass
Is our only opponent that we have, we own it!


All around the world different song same message
Dignity in that spotlight and life’s precious
When we raise voices, we’re joining a chorus
You’re not a solo, the harmony is enormous
Echo John Lennon we echo Nina Simone
We echo my brother Chuck D, that legacy lives on
And when the struggle stress you
Let it bless you keep you strong
And may your voice live on forever in that song

And so if we want to get anywhere we have to be self loving enough, to be honest with ourselves, to do some soul searching!
I’m not talking about soul searching to see what’s inside our soul, we got to find out what the hell happened to our soul. We’ve got to find that shit. I want my humanity back. I want to be a human being again. I don’t want this shit on my conscience no more! I want to live in a fair world. We’ve got to decide to rejoin the human family again. We’re not talking about just this case, we not talking about just this issue, we’re talking about whether or not we’re going to be human beings again
Peace!

Say Amen,Mourning in America and Dreaming in Color,2012,"Truth so heavy it could rumble the earth
I dunked paint brush up in a bucket of words
Ain’t nothing interrupting the urge
Might cut you worse than unguarded love when it hurts
Try to hold it in and my muscles will burst
Do an Incredible Hulk through my shirt
A verse make an old lady jump up in the church
Pass a plate around pulling bucks out her purse
Foremost and first my hunger and thirst
Is not for no blood-stained paper but my love to be heard
Reap what I sowed in the earth
Now watch what emerge out a soul that’s disturbed
Leaning on the very last nerve of you scary ass herbs
Fake thugs and arrogant nerds
Fuck no homo you a no home owning old grown
Unsigned chump month behind on your car loan
You got balls looking down on me
Or got a mirror on the floor trying to find Ali
And dressed flyly but so afraid to soar
You’re all dressed up and got no place to go
And so play a roll there’s no hope of living
More like go broke pretending
Your whole image is imagined I manage
Low expectations high standards
Hip Hop is the legacy of the jazz kings
Kick rocks I’m one of the last standing
Last thing I do is overstate the obvious
Mainstream poppiness underground sloppiness
Dumbed down thuggery and pussy hungry consciousness
Revolution for sale greedy communist
Seinfeld rap your show about nothing
Poetry played it’s all about production
Trying to get placements play like you’re famous
Ain’t added greatness to nary a playlist
Take this bitch take offense
Or if it don’t apply let it fly say amen
Time’s up on y’all posturing imposters
I don’t give a damn if you’re starving or copping Oscars
Out here grinding or floss in your ivory towers
I don’t give a shit about your pants or how you rock em
I ain’t bitter or backpacker or conscious
Just want y’all the fuck out my ear with that nonsense
From the office of Ali and Jake and them
If you feel me raise a hand say amen",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-say-amen-lyrics
Namesake,Mourning in America and Dreaming in Color,2012,"I am somebody
And we am and she am and he am and I am
Somebody

I was raised with the raised fist
Angela Davis summer sixty-eight Olympics
Train banging your wings against
The cage in the event you became cageless
The bane of my existence is to resist
Back never bent re-load never relent
Of All lights shone I’m glimmering glint
I was named after a king in our midst The Greatest
Changed the world in the ring with his fists
More so with the gift when rang from his lips
Bigger than just a individual gift
He had a vision for bringing dignity to the crib
Gold medalist in his Olympic event
Significant respect glistening off his neck
US flag waved the globe was silent
Wore it everywhere he went just to show what it meant
Stepped off the plane back on that pavement
The people hell bent that they will never repent
Celebrate him but his kin still clinched in a
Problem one piece of medal couldn't fix
Legend is he pitched it in the Ohio River
What good is recognition if I know that I’m a -victim
Expelled in a held back curriculum
Class president slash second class citizen
Diligent to fight for people
Nineteen years old sacrificed his ego
So here we go salute my namesake
Many are successful very few are great

Right on y’all. I am somebody
And we am and she am and he am and I am
Somebody
I am he am she am and we am

Won More Hit,Mourning in America and Dreaming in Color,2012,"Please oh please oh please
Give me just one more hit
Please oh please oh please
Give me just one more hit
It’s an 
exorcism
 bitches
A horror story

Okay we stole you from your mother and we beat you red and bloody
And we made you build a country and we never gave you nothing
But a savior with our ugly face painted on the front
And we let you sing about it entertain us every Sunday
Sing when you’re worshipping sing when you’re working
And see if you can sing your self out of the hurt you’re in
Please oh please give me just one more hit
Make it extra special and you might not get the whip
People want to hear your instruments and voices
It’s just so annoying have to always come and join you
It reminds us of the horrible conditions that we’re causing
Really rather avoid it try hard to ignore it
Give me one performance and an engineer record it
Then we can all enjoy it and we never have to know you
Please oh please give me just one more hit
I sell it ‘round the planet and I’m keeping every cent
Treat you like a hero and we all come to see you
In a big fancy theatre dressed in a tuxedo
Going to have to seat you in the kitchen when you feed you
A place this regal doesn’t serve your kind of people
Love to get an earful and praise and even cheer you
But we’re still too fearful to think of eating near you
Please oh please give me just one more hit
You sing so very nice but I don’t want you ‘round my kids


Fetishize your culture yet while it’s still among you
We analyze insult it and criticize and judge it
Look down upon you say your music’s from the jungle
And a civilized country couldn’t gain anything from it
Said it’s from the devil and it cause nothing but trouble
And tell you that you’re ugly and we think it’s so disgusting
But oh please still give me one more hit
Give me 20 years see if I can learn to spit
Your soul power got me so excited
That I went home and I tried it till I could do it just like you
Just a little bit lighter tired with less fire
Stiff sanitized to the white people’s liking
Now they’re so inspired by the way that I recite it
Celebrate a pirate as our nation’s greatest writer
Please oh please give me just one more hit
We like your music better when it’s spilling from our lips
You create it we can’t relate so we hate it
Say it’s too flagrant human nature too naked
But be patient eventually you’ll escape it
Then we take it reshape it rename it and claim it
If you get in the business we’ll just find a way to flip it
We don’t celebrate success you’re getting for a minute
After years of getting rich if you ever make us split it
We’ll just film your cars and cribs call you materialistic
Boys in blue harass you, say you’re getting too successful
Do you for the taxes and sue you for the samples
You just get a plaque so you can glue it on your mantle
Looking dapper when you tap a little tune on your piano
Patented your soul gave your heart a bar code
Now so appalled at the gall to download
Please oh please give me just one more hit
P.S. Thank you and suck my dick
Please oh please oh please",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-won-more-hit-lyrics
Just Fine,Mourning in America and Dreaming in Color,2012,"The revolution will not be televised
The revolution's about to go out and get some exercise
Oh man, sometimes the revolution just needs a break man
Sometimes the revolution just needs to live life
Stop bugging out all the damn time
Check this one out here

The weight of the world is heavy on my mind
There's too much to do, never enough time
Need to learn how to lean and unwind
Take the days one at a time, be just fine

I woke up a little slower than usual
Sunlight pouring in my room, it was beautiful
Could hear that the baby had awaken
But she weren't even crying, she was giggling and playing
I got a call from my best friend
He outside and he's trying to get some breakfast
He said he knew it's right around here
So we left the Cadillac in the driveway and walked there
Laughs and jokes, and eggs and toast, and
I got the bill while he was outside smoking
He dropped it back off
Swear to God we got to do this more often, it was awesome
Bumping my favourite 2Pac song
I took a shower, put some brand new socks on
Turned the TV off, it's too nice out here
Put some clothes on the kids and we're outta here


Neighborhood park, play in the sunshine
Pushing three kids on the swings at one time
Let them run and climb 'till lunchtime
Put them down for naps and scribble a couple rhymes
I'm in my basement, what?
I painted the walls and brought a matching rug
Surrounded by records and beat-making stuff
Jake track bump, drinking water from a jug
Later on I'll probably throw catfish in water
Thaw it, season it, put cornmeal on it
Fire up the stove and heat me up some greens
Farm up crispy and steam some green beans
I don't bake biscuits from scratch
But listen to that (this is good)
Don't nobody care, a lot of grubbing around here
Sparkle a pair of juice in cups in the air


When the sun finally tucks itself behind the stars
I launch out of my backyard with a cigar
Might take a bike on the quiet blocks alone
Bob Marley playing in my pocket on the phone
Streets are peaceful, the croon is sexy
Slide by the lake, see the moon's reflection
Days are crazy, the evenings fly
Airplanes stopped screaming in the sky
Young lady's skin gets warm, she ain't even knowing why
Love starts to gleaming in her eye
Chest start heaving, she breathing, the feelings of the night
Before long she screaming ''oh my God''
I take a little taste of a mint Milano
And my eyes start to dip to the bliss that follows
And I drift off listening to a novel
The revolution is back on again tomorrow",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-just-fine-lyrics
Dreaming in Color,Mourning in America and Dreaming in Color,2012,"I don't beg nobody pardon to be confident
I'm just saying my shit didn't exist until I did it
I'm the one that's suffered for the politics that I done spit
I ain't quit, I hit every continent and bodied it
School of hard knocks equipped and I ain't get a scholarship
Bet I had it poppin' since hip hop was on that power fist
Then when y'all got counterfeit, I switched and did the opposite
Now I'm on some outsider shit, ain't that about a bitch
I ain't never lied about what my skin is, it's obvious
I'm just so obsessed with bringin power to the powerless
I insist; I would never operate on cowardice
Rather chop my wrist than be afraid to take this kind of risk
Every single line I ever spit, I put it on my kids
On my blood, on my tears
All that pain, all them fears
All them shows, all them years
I was chose for this here
Maybe I'm a dreamer that's exactly what my problem is
But when I do dream, believe I see it all too clear
You can keep your money, I just wanted y'all to hear
And remember...ugh...

Thank heaven for blessin me with a heavy flow
Twelve years old, I was already hella professional
Let it go, follow the regular road, hell no
Listen close to my own/ heart like a stethoscope
Wrote myself an episode/ set it and lettin 'em fold
Turned over every stone/ better than ever before
And every sentence I wrote/ shot it direct for your throat
Made every effort to blow/ you best be ready to go
????? never get the doe/ should've known
Didn't piss and moan/ bit my lip, when out and built my own
Hit the road and did the globe/ so many times I've lost count
Time that I done been at home/ and didn't recognize my house
Doctor said  I shouldn't perform/ I just tuned 'em all out
Temperature 104/ rhyme 'til I fall out
I destroyed my vocal chords/ I'mma stand tall and shout
Never let it go/ until they know what I'm bout
I give it all and ain't never runnin out
If you listen close I'll teach you what this love's about
Just remember...

Y'all know I ....Got that mic
On a mic/ all my life/ drop it like
Glowing out my eyes at night
Come on now what's right is right
Always say it's darkest right before the dawn
Come on write/ Till I reach my highest height
I'll not go out without a fight
Bear witness I gets it in/ tear them bitches limb from limb
Carry this through thick and thin and just jump in and sink or swim
Ain't nobody realer than/ realest always recognize
Best believe the slouchers that doubt me just keep me energized
They hold me in cages but my soul is only strengthened
My whole vocation, I rose to those occasions
Growing short of patience/ my ultimate motivation
And no I don't expect no open invitation
But you gon' have to go bed just knowing that you're hating
You're ignoring greatness; that's no exaggeration
Allow me to stretch your imagination
Any way you look at it this shit is amazing
Remember..who we are..",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-dreaming-in-color-lyrics

Now just you hold on a god damn minute now!
Motherfucker hold your eyes up when you're talking to me
Don't you know you're in the presence of greatness boy? Original king
Love to do his thing. You in trouble right now motherfucker

Yes y'all the flesh and bone season
Veteran, yet it's just my second whole season
Etched in stone one of the best poets breathin'
They don't kick over the respect I don't need 'em
I bring it like it never been brung man
I swing it like it never been swung
I'm second to none
As long as I still got a breath in my lung
Might as well find yourself a place to rest til I'm done
Blessed with somethin' called a sophomore curse
That mean you waitin' for me cause you loved my first
Must have heard hunger and thirst up in the verse
And now wanna bust so much that it hurts
Plus what am I? A flash in the pan?
I fizzle out and stand here, ass in my hand
I ain't that kind of man, I'm attached to my fans
Every track that I smash gotta match their demands
I'm the first to the venue, last to the van
I carry turntables and the wax for my man
I shoot a star out the sky, land in my hand
I'm off to the next one catch me if you can
Amen

Not fuckin' around. Been watchin' you motherfuckers scurrin' around and shit
Swear to God you real. You ain't seen shit. You ain't did shit
You 'bout shit. Hold up

I hear tell that I ain't your cup of tea
I fuck with white rappers and you can't fuck with me
I sold my old pistol and don't run the streets
And I ain't got tattoos all up my sleeves
Well
All I can tell you is that I am what I am
How could you not respect one that stand as a man?
Lest you never peek up out your box
You a follower
I don't kiss ass and suck dick, I'm not popular but
If you were real you would recognize me
They don't make them like motherfuckin' Ali
No more
I ain't here to blow my own horn
But it takes a certain person to write those songs
The biggest difference between us
Is unlike them I don't pretend to be no thug
Just a city kid and know how to throw a punch
I'm no stranger to the taste of my own blood
Got you chain and decide to grow nuts
That shit's Golden Girls that ain't golden gloves
Tell 'em Ant
I ain't scrap no more, I'm growed up
Too busy, no free hand to hold a grudge
Told your ass once that my shit is amazin'
Seen me on stage, think it's biscuits and gravy
I spent my young life in the eye of the shit
Don't hate me for anything I ever did
Motherfucker!

I mean come on now. What you starin' at your speaker for man?
There's nothing wrong with it. There's no holes here
It's you, you're hatin'

I live I die, I laugh so that I don't cry
I work hard
I bust my young ass to survive

Get crossed off my list when the sawed off kicks
Ain't no more bitch shit

On some Fresh game of chess on the park benches
I kindly invite y'all to mind y'all business
Before I close down the castle and the draw bridge lift
I clown and kick to get a spot like this
My pocket knife twist through your heart like this
Vocals blastin'
The soul impassioned
Clothes won't be clashin'
I'm so old fashion
Cold blooded assassin
Microphone graspin'
Dealin' with your rappers in an orderly fashion
They lean back baskin' in the gleam of the Brother
I'm Superfly T-N-T motherfucker
Who God bless, let no man curse
Your new-new shit ain't fuckin' with my old ass verse
I flash on your foolish like a Kodak burst
And paint a picture with your weaknesses I know that hurts
Don't you know the prophet feed the poor man first?
Need to fix your own plate daddy, your hands work
The higher the monkey climbs the more he show his asshole
One for the freestyle, two for the cash flow

The Trap,Off the Record,2007,"Judge not lest ye shall be judged. Let he who is without sin cast the first stone
Until you have walked a mile in a man's shoes you can not judge a man

What if that was you born to the left of the tracks?
The place where you grow up is infested with rats
The Army didn't segregate that
Everybody who could, left in a snap
And never looked back
And since they've been gone they haven't invested in jack
Left very few ways for you to generate scratch
Your school is under funded, your teachers over worked
And when it comes to text books you gotta settle for scraps
And seldom when trapped
The wall pressed to your back
Can we ever think of anything except to react
If you ain't Einstein, you just a regular cat
And your self preservation is a medical fact
Then done set you up a helluva trap
They put bait in your face and if you take it then you never get back
What kind of set up is that?
The justice is just that
Just us, a public defender, his head up his ass
You're headed to a place where slavery is legal
And you being a human ain't no relevant fact
And if you play nice
You might escape with your life
And get a release date but don't celebrate yet!
Cause they're sending you back
To where you fell threw the cracks
Except now it's harder because you got a felony rap
Might get an interview but your resume's jacked
And the second they find out you got an F it's a wrap
In the 70's cats, from the ghetto made rap
Unifying worldwide, we all felt the impact
But the company that stole out, they sellin' it back
Stripped all down to, really, the irrelevant crap
And the message is that
If you poor you black
Throw some shells up in the gat and go and sell you some crack
Then you'll have shiny things and money in stacks
And Destiny's Child will want to fuck you for that
Look how the fuckin' deck has been stacked
And the effect it can have on you feelin' you never had a chance
Don't be judging people in a second at a glance
Or act superior because the blessings that you had
God don't prefer you, He's testing your ass
With the benefit you're givin', you're expected to pass
Take a look in the mirror
Reflect on that
Just might be a hypocrite reflecting in the glass
With yo bitch ass!",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-the-trap-lyrics

You are now inside the brain of Americas best
Forrest Whittaker hungry, it's about to get ugly
Police with their arm extended can't touch me
Smacked in the face is how this shit struck me like
Showstopper
A-L-I the Brother
Since 89's the number
And ain't tryin' to slumber
Representin' for the birth pain of my mother
Ali like Rocky, I train in the gutter
But it ain't about the tunnel
It's the light at the end
And we walkin' through life with a mic and a pen
Mentality is that of a cat who gon eat
I grind till the sparks dance off the concrete
Stand close to me
Watch me hopefully
Cause you're gonna see my gift open up the door for me
The last of a dying breed
Live MC
Look inside my eyes and see what's inside of me

The ock got the fire in the eye
All head turn when the brother walk by
And you should know that when you got that little feelin' in your soul and you're cold
And tonight you might die ahhhhh!

The syllabus will be read aloud this evenin'
Watch out now if you're too opposed to be in this
Open season
You should know not to walk nearby the cage when it's this close to feedin'
Hold your feet in the flame
Ali is the name
You'll be chantin' ""boom bye aye"" when you repeat it in vain
His beats are insane
And you can ask any local wack rapper to show you where the teeth are ingrained
Even my lazy eye got that fire in it
Went from grindin' to shinin' and now sky's the limit
They do it every day without disguise or gimmick
Your face look better when my fist grind up in it
This is the house that the Sayers build
Now I use it as a return address when I pay my bills
Pain and guilt fill the pages up
We gonna ride till our days is up

Baby Come Home,Off the Record,2007,"Baby come home we need you
To keep being strong and reach through
Just please do whatever you need to
We broke and it won't be complete till we see you

Ain't no sunshine never
She's always gone too long, this house is not a home
Unties that bind, unturn turnacit
So this wife of mine is in turn turning tricks
I know why you put the devil in your vein
That's the only time you feel separate from your pain
I can't believe you never gonna change
So I'm trying to hold a paper house together in the rain
Baby girl came home with lice
Had to wash her hair
Almost lost her to foster care
Her dinner is Micky D's drive through
I'm in the streets till the wee hours tryin' to find you
I can't let you go
I've seen the treasure no
I know better had to go fetch you
I'm depressed and the problem is
Can't rest till you die or decide to live so...


When you were born I had a head full of vision
You in college, us with a family business
But as you grew I realized
I had no clue exactly what it is a dad should do
And that being true I should have never been surprised when
Your friends in the streets had your ears more than I did
Every bit of dream I had was crushed
They put my little man in a bus, hands in cuffs
Hard to face it
You incarcerated
Just don't play cards, lift weights and waste it
Back against the wall, pissed off and angered
Pinpoint the point where you get lost and change it
Or one day you're gonna look up
Your life half over and you passed on the good stuff
If we ever get a second chance to hook up
We'll pass through the past and pick up where we should have son


You a stranger in your old old neighborhood
Moved to the sun, forgot about the greater good
Act like nobody gave you a push
Now you're trying to get the history erased from your book
Look
You ain't rich your middle class
Lucky your family don't whup your stinkin' ass
While you in Paris, carelessly shoppin'
Your parents are starvin', tears in their apartment
No wonder you don't come home more often
So ashamed of what you are that you're an orphan
Don't you see that you would die?
If a tree don't feed it's roots it's suicide
No matter how far from home you reside
A little of the truth in you refuses to die
The world is a circle
So no matter how far you roam
You can't help but touch home girl",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-baby-come-home-lyrics
Pitch Black Noon,Off the Record,2007,"From can't see in the mornin'
Breakin' my back, until can't see at night
Number five, back seat I write
Shadows On The Sun with a shabby little light
I would gladly give my life to this battle till it's won
At the crib the
Shower don't get hot
In the winter my kids eatin' Top Ramen for dinner
Listen
I ain't dissin' but there's something that you're missin'
A lot of us are livin' in this type of condition
Buildings filled with heights, tryin' to get their heads straight
Got a baby and the radiator chip lead paint
The land lord, a hustler, he ain't givin' a fuck
If I rift with him too much then this shit will erupt
There's a housing crisis in my city
So if he evict me
There's a long list of kids that are willing to give up their left kidney to
Replace me
Get my place, work my ten hour days and live shitty
Don't push me cause I'm close to the edge
Paranoid I got a pistol at the post of my bed
Why?
Ain't no killer, but I'm half-assed blind
They tryin' to run in the pad and grab what's mine
What?
Busted TV, you can have that
Fine
Them books' in the front room, I mastered every line
But you so much as ruffle my curtain tonight
I'm gonna teach your jerky ass about the circle of life

Wrong side of track
Dark side of the moon
Left side of the brain where he organize the tomb
Choose sides wisely because when you gather your platoon
Cause I show down and draw on your ass like high noon
Wrong side of track
Dark side of the moon
Left side of the brain when he look inside the gloom
Choose sides wisely because when you gather your platoon
Cause I show down and draw on your ass like high noon

I show up to the showdown
Get up for the down stroke
Pushin' brass knuckles through the back of your clown throat
Leave a grease stain like your ass a phantom
I blow out the candle in your jack-o-lantern
The hands of the last man standin'
Magically become cannons when he blast into a tantrum
Whip him, lash him, beat him, batter him
Keep him graspin' for that last gasp of wind
Death rattle pass through him
Let him close his eyes and his bullshit life flash for him
Finally when his soul detaches from within
Catch me passin' through the moonlight, holdin' back a grin",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-pitch-black-noon-lyrics
Life Sentence,Off the Record,2007,"Streams roll into the ocean
Rivers roll into the sea
If I can't sing my life one of y'all might got to come and bury me
Streams roll into the ocean
Rivers roll into the sea
If I can't sing my life one of y'all might got to come and bury me

Oh yeah, the flow here is so real
Won't hear me so bare and vocals nowhere
No hood up or robe, post golden years
My most sincere quotes I unload 'em here
Your local hero don't compare
No, yeah, don't you dare hold a mirror to me
That's no fair
You ain't gotta do your poker stare over here
Honestly don't care what cards you holdin' there
Most my heroes don't even compete with me
I'm on my own kinda sucker free frequency
I got a IQ I refuse to speak beneath
And to lie to you would only cheapen me
Seem to me most these dudes are car poolin'
One of y'all do somethin' new and then you all do it
Havin' deja vu
They enjoy something Jay-Z do, then either sample it or say it too
I guess we wasn't taught the same rules
I was brought up bitin' is a sin you gotta pay your dues
That's for underground and mainstream too
The blame's on you bitches, shame on you

Streams roll into the ocean
Rivers roll into the sea
If I can't sing my life one of y'all might got to come and bury me
Streams roll into the ocean
Rivers roll into the sea
If I can't sing my life one of y'all might got to come and bury me

I should only have to tell y'all once
Only come back just to prove it to ya
Never had to (punch) through my track misconfused
On my particular brand of truth is undisputed
It's a fact - stupid people dig stupid ass music and that
Labels suit seven out of ten humans
Huntin' cats in the underground movement
I do exactly what I wanna do and I'm building one room at a time
Damn the blueprint and I'm
Doing just fine in my own mind
Trying to be one of the greatest of all time
If you ain't doin that you wasting your time
I shake the floorboards til the foundation whine
You know nothing bout what it takes to shine
Do an about face and holler out ""peace, goodbye!""
I'm a star in the evening sky
Got the sun in my hand and the fire in my eye, Lord!

Officer Down,Off the Record,2007,"Let's even it up
Your blood for our blood
Feed 'em from what we been eatin'
Make em taste sour love
They speak a funny tongue-
Only understand the language of money and guns
And they only left us one
So we gon' holla at ya
Chop it up and parlay with ya
Watch the god complex whither when the hollows hit ya
May your blood clean the streets where you killed our future
And shot Yatusa
Lest you give body to Lucifer
Cold walkin' zombie with bullets for eyes
It's not just a disguise
They bitter killers inside the
Human fingers of the slave trade legacy
Vampire overseer incarnate ugly like the Mona Lisa
If you livin' in the fringe
The mere image is enough to make you quiver in your skin 'cause
They have no consequences, they have no fear
Put one behind one's ear, do one every year
Drop a bowling ball through the roof of a squad car
Hang 'em from a light pole as proof that they are not hard
This is the anger that you created by strangling a man in the middle of the streets with his hands up
Picture on a closed casket where the phony flag sits
Let 'em never take black tape off of they badges
The slave's last task is digging graves for their masters
Plant 'em in the field where they prayed for disaster

Stupid, retarded
Aimin' at targets
Blastin' with purpose
Workin' with burners
Hood service
Community outlets
Out with the mindset
That we can't police ourself
'cause we savages
We don't need you
You create the problems we can see through
Money operations
See you stop an' wait
And pop pop a Glock
Non stop up inside a station
While we was springing my mind
Steady evaluatin'
Reflectin' and plannin'
For understandin'
What was I born on this planet to cause havoc?
In every life on the Earth I been an underdog
Reppin' with field nigga
Ex-slave with real people
One for  and two for Courtney Williams

Workin' with pigs it won't help and
There's no good pigs on the force
I'm Islam, you Swine
Unless you cross that Blue Line
We got terrorists with blue steel
Exercise the free will to kill
But still it gets really real
From slave catchers to serpents that serve murder
A pig slaughtered to me
Is like a dropped burglar
The media pumps his wife and his kids
And we get blasted, it's like we did a bid
So get ready as we ride 'til we die
It's some serious as tears start to fly

To my man Blueprint brother. Rock the house
To my guy Mr. Dibbs dude. Rock the house
To my girl Psalm One baby. Rock the house
And my man Vast Aire yo. Rock the house
And my man Immortal Technique. Rock the house
Check it out

The first time
We dropped a little somethin'
They start buzzin' like King Solomon was comin'
Album of the year was the topic of discussion
Once you got that little rush it's impossible to touch it
Then the ground froze and I'm growlin' in the stomach
Underground shows I'm devouring the public
It's all I know, but I'm a scholar of the subject
Where ever I go it's like they follow me or some shit
I ain't a part of no damn record business
I ain't got a single fan, I got brothers and sisters
Every time they raise their hands they bare witness
They listenin' and they know that a man who cares did this
Ever since I'm a pip squeak and can't even pee straight
Had some shit to speak on a beat break
Guaranteed to dig a little deeper with each take
Bleedin' on the beat till the meat on my knees shake
They call me a beast, I just think I'm the least fake
I know I'll be alone on my judgment day
I believe it to the bone what the fuck I say
My shit's etched in stone and it's done my way
One.Be.Lo. Rock the house
And the Brand Nubian crew. Rock the house
To the lord Rakim brother. Rock the house
Mr. Lif, Kid Capri. Rock the house
To my brother C-Rayz Walz. Rock the house
And my man I-Self Devine rockin' the house
To my brother Toki Wright man. Rock the house
And the Los Nativos rockin' the house

In 2003 I was the number one challenger
Then years started fallin' off the calendar
'04 champion, knee deep, kept my balance up
'05 and 6 I still didn't have an album, fuck
Jay-Z retired and came back
I'm still out here kickin' the same tracks
How in the world am I supposed to explain that?
Except that I hastefully chase what I aim at
And the same passion that I put in when I'm kickin' my shit
I rebuild my entire life brick by brick
And I couldn't tell the story till I knew what the endin' was
God give us messages, you better listen when he does
Y'all supportin' me, always there for me
Still got a babysitter, Pager Money came and saw me
I give you my life
Just give me an hour of yours
Check the album
Check us out on the tour
I never go to song without an album no more
If you ain't got the money steal it from the popular store
If you take away one thing just know above all
I ain't rich, but I'm livin' and I owe it to y'all
So Minneapolis. Rock the house
And yes St. Paul. Rock the house
And Chicago, Illinois man. Rock the house",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-operation-push-lyrics

Don't be yellin' my name
On the shit that don't involve me
Don't call me
Any y'all cats want me
You can find me in the lobby
With my arm around your baby mom
Kissin' on her neck like ""man, this is on me""
So salty
My metaphors two steps ahead of yours
And I'ma step ahead of you
Any other heads are booed
And I beckon you
That what you better do is let 'em through
Beggin
Bone shuttering utterances
Other than this
It doesn't exist
I'm competitive and never lose
It's hell to anyone who wanna diss Ali
Ain't nobody fuckin' with my disc jockey
It's all about whether or not you rhyme nice
Don't care about the ice in your wristwatch

Smoke in the eyes, suspended by the moment
I pull my hat low so as not to see nothing but my spit clutching the mic, reflected in the light
Felt like we breathed in electric air from the evening
Exhaled a jewel and left it there
I'm in my own hometown where the drums live
Guitar picker from Phila on some other shit
I smelt Paris in the horn, taste London in the keys
When I'm a Rhymesayer, brothers with me
On a deep cosmos, natural high cool
With God in my ear tellin' me to ride through
I'm ain't trying to hear the playback, jack
I was there in the flesh and I'm blessed that I can say that
You feel it in your chest and play that
You got it in your mind, say that
You can't arrange that

One, two
Rockin' for you and you
Ursus Minor Crew officially doin' the do
We gon' throw down hard, like oh my God
And when it hit ya there ain't nothin' that you can do
So one, two
Rockin' for you and you
Ursus Minor Crew officially doin' the do
We gon' throw down hard, like oh my God
And when it hit ya there ain't nothin' that you can do

I said temper thy tongue my son
Ah, a good kid at drums is hard to come by
I found rhythm where the doves cry
So attentive I was, my young mind a dry sponge
Soaked it all in
Grow some balls then
Not try to quote what I wrote with a ball pen
Since the choice to rap or just voice the facts
I guess my point is that
I been
Standing on four four beats butt naked
Since around the time Busy Bee was famous, huh
Music 'po be somethin' sacred
So please rest assured that Ali don't fake shit
Regardless of the theme
And as hard as it may seem
Put my two cents on the table
Whether they tarnished or they clean
Keep my heart in the stream
Separate myself from the garbage on the scene
Come down now you

Rockin' for you and you
Ursus Minor Crew officially doin' the do
We gon' throw down hard, like oh my God
And when it hit ya there ain't nothin' that you can do
One, two
Rockin' for you and you

Think it Through,Rites of Passage,2000,"Attack fame with cerebral cortex in your brains
So my effects will remain long after the trends change
Son, I'll bend your name, rearrange your molecules
Amongst hip-hop dudes, Brother Ali be droppin' jewels
Impossible to fool, I'm like Picasso with the tool
A fossil, old-school rapper passing all the rules
Never hostile to your crew but colossal with my moves
When my face is in the place y'all start droppin' that stool
I did a lot in schools and that three years are cool
But known as about a Muslim MC
Super-duper Brother Ali is rockin' goofies and loose jeans
The last years Timberlands, dodgin' deuce-deuce teams
Who seem to wanna wet me cause they girlfriends sweat me
For the way I interact with my peers, they respect me
Because I respect them
And let them speak the peace and get my two cents in

On the architectural design in your mind
And redesign your outline
I shout rhymes through a dynamic mic
Automatic hype and if I'm slammin right
Change the way you look at your life
And all you can say is Ali came to shook it tonight
And just stand back shake your head and look at the sight
And now my soul can breathe a sigh of relief
For squashing all prior beef cause don't nobody wanna die on the streets
Rely on the beats to save ya, you'll never get help
Get a chance to go for self
And what you do? Go for self
I got a wealth of wisdom
So I skip the player themes
Instead I'm aiming off the hot sense of your brain with laser beams
My ways and means have always produced amazing scenes
Not like the phony fellas, come at you fake like Maybeline
But got major cream
Whenever I, label jeans
But when I get up in your brain I reawaken your dreams
Know what I mean?

{""Take these words home and think it through""}
{""Greater mission, I hope that you're listening""}

I've got a mission to add traditions to the inscriptions on your cognitions
Supervising with provisions
You wouldn't understand why Ali is here
But when the student is prepared the teacher appears
And I've been speaking for years of passage you got that?
You still tryin' to understand the metaphor for where hip-hop at
Have you ever thought that every time you listen to a track
That's four minutes of your life that you can never get back?
And that's a hell of an investment
So when MC's blessing
We gotta think very hard about the message
I ain't tryin' to hear about you sippin Crystal in the Bahamas
When I'm drinkin Nestle Quik on a crowed bus full of maecenas
And give us appetite to check by knowledge
I'm starving for Versace but you never mention college
So I'm supposed to get it and be a rap star like you
How many of us can do that for real? Very few
If I sell drugs, or die, or go to jail, or go to hell either way
If you keepin' it real how come there's no truth to what you say?
Remember this, we make rap stars rich and company's even richer

Splatter (x4)

You jacking me? You got the wrong season
You got your piece, I got my piece
And all I need now is a reason, for me to start squeezing
Matter of fact, give me your rings, watch, and your house keys
And make it fast shorty, or I'mma put gun smoke, up in the breeze
And I'm glad he ain't call my bluff, because I ain't really had my gat
It wouldn't have been nothing, for him, to peel back
My wig, he saw this piggy go, wee-wee all the way home
To get my chrome, because now I got to lock some shots off in that dome
(Why's that?) Because my manhood has got to stay intact
He can't just play me out, in front of the ladies, that shit is wack
But now I got my gat, back down in the downtown district
Dying to spill some gravy on this mother{*cough*} biscuit
Seen him kicking it out on Nicklet, like it was nothin'
Go around the block one more time, and I swear to God I'm dumpin'
Looked over my shoulder, know this was the time and the place
I jumped out the car, unloaded the nine up in his face!
With no feelin', peelin' out, tires all squeelin'
Adrenalin to my brain, got me higher than the ceilin'
But people talk, I'll probably never get dissed again
And Minnesota got ten thousand lakes, to dump the pistol in

Woah

 (Go-o bang!) (x3)
Wa-da-da-dang, wa-da-da-da-dang, listen to my nine millimeter go bang

I ran home quick, changed my clothes and dipped in my lady's Trans-Am
If they ask you where I am don't tell em shit
You ain't seen me or heard from me; she asked where I would go
I said: ""You know I'mma go stay with grandma down in Chicago
I know how fast your car go, way up over a hundred
But I can't get caught speeding, I might be federally wanted""
Man them cops be on it, I can't afford to get sloppy
Cause if I slip up at any single point, yo they got me
So I rock the accelerator never greater than limit
Thinking strictly about my journey, what I did, still hasn't hit me
I touch down in the Chi, grandma stay on Southside
Just trying to get some rest after that eight hour drive
And Grandma surprised, but always happy to see me
So I'm kicked up at the rest, playing Nintendo, watching T.V
And believe me, I know that I'm still on the run
But I'm happy that this part of the ghetto way is done

Yo, it's kind of hard to live with what I did
Because everytime I close my eyes, all I see is me blasting that kid
But yo, I did exactly what I had to do
If that was him in my shoes; he would've blasted me too
Besides, everybody's mamma cry sometime
And you know everyone got to die sometime
And grandma said I had a cousin in Minnesota, that I ain't even know about, you know
And just last week, he got his brains blown out
And so his little funeral was being held today
I'm dressed in black Versacci, and mad respect I pay
But whoever shot my cousin, sure wet up that po' bastard
Because the wake and the funeral was strictly closed casket
But yo, they had his picture on the program, and oh damn
They had his picture on the program, and oh damn
Stared at my cousin on that program, and I couldn't even speak
That's the kid that I shot last week

Whatever,Rites of Passage,2000,"We live on the edge like mountain climbers and we worship clothes designers
If I changed my name to Ralph Lauren
I really would shine
In the streets we compete
For who tag our name the best
But we blow our paychecks
Stickin' Tommy on our chest
Since the death of the ???
We made our women freaky
They blind like Stevie
Thinkin' that life is TV
Believe me, in the streets we be bangin' it out
Content to let Uncle Sam be the man in our house
We waste money and call it cheese
Smoke plants and call 'em trees
While subsidized daycare workers
Raise our seeds
We swap body fluids with who's ever with it
And think marriage is a big commitment
So we want the sex and not the kids
We want the check and not the job
But most of all we want the blessings
But don't answer to God
Got a closet full of clothes and empty bank accounts
If you ??? we ain't got nothin' we bounce
Amounts are too costly for us to go to college
But we pay them high interest bail bonds when they lock us
This soap opera life got us all hopped up
And we don't touch the scriptures 'til we get locked up

So we do whatever
Eat whatever
Smoke whatever
---- whoever
Wear whatever
Shake whatever
Sell whatever
It's now or never

Yo if grandma and grandpa saw how we behave
They would probably roll around like Yo-Yos in their grave
Whether is projects or trailer parks, we're all in the dark
There's no connectedness, our families falling apart
And White suburbanites think they're fleeing the games
But then their kids go to school and shoot 'em up like Jesse James
The projects are just a carbon copy of the prisons
So when we get locked we're just gettin' more original
A 6-year-old at the park could probably curse
Do the streets make us crazy or is it the vice-versa?
We might hurt you if you talk bad about our wife
But at night, we beat her within an inch of her life
We kill our unborn kids, and no one blows the whistle
If you want it it's a baby
If you don't it's only tissue
We only miss you and cry for you when you die
But we ain't got time for that ---- when you're alive
We don't apologize, and do get caught with red fingers
We don't read newspapers, we watch Jerry Springer
Our so-called leaders whine for legislation
When the biggest problem we have is our decision making


We shake our ---es and life skates past us
We love welfare and hate taxes
So we pour in the lotto, dice games and the numbers
And think it's too risky to invest in one another
We call on others ???
But what could that mean?
Cause a ??? will turn them into crack fiends
We act mean, we act sharp like razor blades
We act like animals but we say we hate the cage
This soap opera life got us all hopped up
And we don't touch the scriptures 'til we get locked up

Eighty-8,Rites of Passage,2000,"I was raised on the hip-hop
More raised in more ways than one
This is back when hip-hop was still fun
When Public Enemy was still number one
Before all the pro-black cats discovered guns. (No funds!)
Countin’ money so me and my man skate
To Kool Moe Dee records Makin’ up hand-shakes
He’s a damn fake to say he can’t relate to Mike Tyson Punch-Out
Drinkin’ up the Kool-aid and getting’ cussed-out
Bust out in the evening, I’m free when I’m breathin’
Incense and got the EPMDin’
Back then an album was something you could listen to for 6 months straight
(Somebody slap me if that isn’t true)
When my religion was hip-hop, Chris dropped the testament
That to this day got me wanna be intelligent
We didn’t have Mumia back then
We had Mandela back then
I rock the green, black and yellow back then
When Foxy Brown was breakin' in her first training bra we had dreams
But Rosie Perez is who we saw
Never said that I was old school but let me get it straight
This game has never been as straight as it was in ‘88

Doin’ my thang with an ’89 swing
Kick this one here for me and my king
’89 the number, another summer
One one one one
The mic the man, the master plan
And if you need ‘em I got crazy prophylactics
Had to climax when I max, relax and chill
Sit down eat your slice of pizza and be quiet

Three Day Journey,Rites of Passage,2000,"Intro:
""I sometimes feel like I am impersonating the dark subconscious of the whole human race""
Verse One:
To touch me is a luxury that most never experience
A Lyricist, Loungin in the shadow where my spirit is
I'm baring this cross for so long
There's not a care in this world that can cause me to join the heretics
I carry this solution inside and can't express it
I try to shake the Word and escape the adolescence
The lessons that God taught me won't let me rest easy
There's no escapin' this whole creation that sees me
I be a ray of light amongst the dark
Half of this poem I write, in the night I travel alone
Mappin' my own route
Tryin' to pull out as soon as possible
Because every new person I meet is a new obstacle
? oracles I speak with are bleak with
Forecast if I keep this
Damn, I got a secret
I seated in a hull of a ship
My destination unknown now
Forsaken my Lord I'm all alone now
And lack the know how to show my folks how to make it
Motivated by the hatred in a world where nothing is sacred
My knees shakin' my blood runs cold
I start tremblin'
My heart dangling by a thread
Voices in my head say
Chorus:
All I know is I don't wanna know what I know
To be in this position
(Hell no!)
I'm going fishin'
I'm sorta wishin' my people didn't concern me
(But they do!)
So I got a three day journey 
Verse Two:
Up above I hear the waves rushin'
Heart bangin' like percussion
Mucus in my lungs slushin'
Just then, two men seize me
Release me among strangers
One spoke for him, his voice reveals anger
""The danger that we're in is because of you
We don't know you. What's your name?""
""Jonah""
""We're gonna have to throw you over""
Before I knew it I was movin' toward the ragin' sea
Then creation turned against me
There's no savin' me
I should call out to God but what's the chance of him answerin'?
A more disobedient man, there hasn't been
There's no chance for me, so fuck it I'll drown
I'll just relax and let the strong current take me down
As I approach the abyss with body and soul
Yo, this large mouth fish swallowed me whole!
From the belly of the ship to the belly of the fish
And the only thing that my brain thinks is this
Chorus 
Verse Three:
There is no escapin' this situation
I can't even die
I ran out of tears and can't even cry
I broke down and saw God, I should have followed his plan
Then the fish went and spit, spit me out of the land
I land on dry land
Hot sand scorchin' my steps
Sunlight burn down on my neck
A little plant grew up around me
And shade me with leaves
It's a three day journey to my people I believe
As long as I'm livin' I can still accept the mission
I'm fishin' for those who can listen to this religion
As long as I'm livin' I can still accept the mission
I'm fishin' for those who can listen to this religion

Emotions .. so, so much sometimes .. and a .. I mean .. it's just kinda ..
I don't know man .. it's just the whole way that happend .. it's just ..

She had the brown west african features
She was lookin' sweet as peaches
On gorgeous spring day
With a thing to say
Little or no make-up
Covered her face up
But brother when she smiles
She light the whole place up
She was covered from the waist up
In a pastel pink scarf
She's soft
And Midas with the way that she talk
In my thoughts she kept me company when we
We're apart
Early on I felt that she would own a piece of my heart
Out of respect
I kept the distance in the physical
But moved in on the mental and emotional
'til she seem more approachable
So hopefull I had never been casanova
I had never been
She's probablly been approached by better men
But then again
I please the earth-citizen
She probablly like religious men
That's something that most are conciderin'
I sat back and thought about it
Then reflect
If I approach her with respect
Our roads have got to intersect
Ahhh
It got deeper said her name
Was Latifah,
 
""Glad to meet cha
Heard you was a preacher
Maybe later we'll speak""
I felt numb, dizzy
Body tingelin', thinkin' what to say next
Ready to sign over my paychecks
No disguise
On the blessing
From her eyes
I was guessin'
She had been through
Enough to know the evil that some men do
I felt the pain
I be umbrella in the rain
Body yell the name
After that I never felt the same
She felt warm to me
Her eyes sang a song to me
She long for me
To touch her I can feel it
But too shy to reveal it
The strong attraction started creepin' in
We can spin together through the universe
But must become a unit first
We ain't had money for the big weddin receptions
But we had the real commitment
And the priceless connection
The mere mention of the name Latifah
Sent me deep into the ocean
With no scuba dive suit
This girl is potion(?)
When I'm in pain
All she has to do is put a hand on me
Y'all ain't understandin' me
She: bring out the man in me
She: ain't 'fraid to challenge me
She: know how to handle me
We: go build this a family
Strong up off reality
Together in the Jihad
We struggle hard to please god
With each and every aspect of life
We increase
And with each pass of year
It's more and more clear
That god is the reason that we're both still here
If we follow his directions
We're expectin' his protection
And I'm carving out a section
Of this earth for us to rest in
I'm strivin'
I'm never satisfied with just survivin'
Strivin' to provide a life in which our soul feels alright in
You're a priceless diamond
At your feet is where the paradise is lying
Even the nicest rhyme in the world couldn't explain
This is just my attempt to document
The blessin' that
Walked into my life one afternoon
I love you",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-so-dearly-lyrics
They’re Finished,Rites of Passage,2000,"""We have a small disturbance at Lake Street in Chicago, some young men fighting
Could we get some cars to go and check that out please?""
A young man stands up against the wall
Dressed in all blue, tilted hatbrim and all
He's got his peeps around him, so he's talkin supertall
About how many women he got or how much he ball
Second man comes walkin down the street
This one dressed in all red from his head to the sneaks
It's the same thing, he's shootin off the mouth to his peeps
Sees the one in blue, walks over and starts to speak
""I'm from such and such a gang, I'll knock ya out, woop-de-woop
?? blue said ""I told you, I don't fight, fool, I shoot""
The one in red said ""I'll still bust your mouth like ""bloo!""
Man, you gon' get your wig split out here tryin to act cute""
Neither one of them likes being threatened
They talking superbig and so their friends won't see'em sweatin
Neither one of them wants this to be the day that they're regrettin
Cause nowadays, you never know who's packing a weapon
So they talk and talk and talk and, talk and talk and
They talk and talk and talk and, talk and talk and
They talk and talk and talk and, talk and talk and
""This is how the story goes""
The argument is gettin louder and louder
A crowd of people notice that so naturally they started to surround'em
One pulled his fist up, man he really wants to pound him
He threw the one-two and he tried to ten-count him
Like ""huh, huh""
You know these kids can't fight
He missed him with the left and barely nicked him with the right
But now they notice that they're in the female sight
So they go and try to knock eachother out
??? out of breath, cause they ain't about nothin
Three minutes later, they both huffin and puffin
Hollerin to they crew like ""Yo, you better tell that man somethin""
Everybody laughin, cause they know they only frontin
But they fightin, fightin, fightin, fightin, fightin
They fightin, fightin, fightin, fightin, fightin
They fightin, fightin, fightin, fightin, fightin
""This is how the story goes""
The storeowner comes out with a broomstick and some mace
Like ""Yo, you kids can't fight in front of my place""
So they pull'em apart, they both red in the face
Like ""I'll get you in another time, another place""
So they both pick up what little pride they got left
And go back to the rest, embarrased to death
This was their big chance to prove they big strength
Instead they just both made a fool of theyselves
If you from the neighborhood, then you already know
I ain't even got to tell you how the story go
Everybody talkin bout ?? the tension grow
Y'all go ahead and laugh and I'm a kill ??
Teenagers today have too many bad habits
And way too proud to let static be static
And that combination right there is problematic
Cause shorty knows a way he can cop an automatic
So he's schemin, schemin, schemin, schemin, schemin
He's schemin, schemin, schemin, schemin, schemin
He's schemin, schemin, schemin, schemin, schemin
""This is how the story goes""
So now shorty and his cousin borrow his aunt's car
With the gat in the lap they try to find where they are
They know where they they be at, they ain't have to look far
He scared as hell but he's like ""Yo, I'm ready for war""
They roll up on the scene, roll down the window
Said a few words, then let the gat blow
He hit his enemy but his girlfriend also
And all of a sudden here comes the po po
They hollered at shorty to throw down the heater
But he tryin to go out like he's Lil' Ceasar
They wet his ass up without even takin a breather
In their mind that's just proper police procedure
Now everybody's at the funeral scene
Boo hoo'in about how he was only fifteen
He should have been at home playin video games
But he got too wrapped up in the rap and the fame
So now they finished, finished, finished, finished, finished
They finished, finished, finished, finished, finished
They finished, finished, finished, finished, finished
""This is how the story goes""

Nice Double Em,Rites of Passage,2000,"(Rat-ta-tat, rat-ta-tat, rat-ta-tat, tatta rat-ta-ta-tatta to make his blood
Splatter
You jackin me you go the wrong season
You got your piece I got my piece
And all I need now is a reason for me to start squeasin'
Matter fact, gimme your rings, watch, and yo house keys
And make it fast shorty, or I'ma put gun smoke up in the breeze
And I'm glad he ain't call my bluff cause I ain't really had my gat
It wouldn't of been nothing for him to peel back
My wig, he saw this piggy go wee-wee all the way home
To get my chrome cause now I got to lock some shots off in that dome (Why's that?)
Because my manhood has got to stay in pact
He can't just play me out in front of the ladies, that shit is wack
But now I got my gat back down in the downtown district
Dyin' to spill some gravy on this motherf*cking biscuit
Seen him kicking it out on Nicklet like it was nothin'
Go around the block one more time and I swear to God I'm dumpin'
Looked over my shoulder knowin' time was any place
I jumped out the car, unloaded the nine up in his face!
With no feelin, peelin' out, tires all squeelin'
Adrenilen to my brain got me higher than the ceilin'
But people talk, I'll probly never get dissed again
And Minnesota got ten thousand lakes to dump the pistol in
Oooh..
Wa-da-da-dang, wa-da-da-da-dang, listen to my nine millimeter go bang (Go Bang!)
I ran home quick, changed my clothes and dipped in my lady's transam
If they ask you where I am don't tell em shit
You ain't seen me or heard from me, she asked where I would go
I said you know I'ma go stay with grandma down in Chicago
I know how fast your car go, way up over a hundred
But I can't get caught speedin, I might be federally wanted
Man them cops be on it, I can't afford to get sloppy
Cause if I slip up at any single point yo they got me
So I rock the accelerator never greater than (???)
Thinking strictly about my journey, what I did still hasn't hit me
I touch down in the shy, grandma stay on southside
Just trying to get some rest after that eight hour drive
And Grandma surprised, but always happy to see me
So I'm kicked up at the rest playing Nintendo watching t.v
And believe me I know that I'm still on the run
But I'm happy that this part of the getaway is done
Cause I..
Yo, it's kinda hard to live with what I did
Cause everytime I close my eyes all I see is me blasting that kid
But yo, I did exactly what I had to do
If that was him in my shoes he would of blasted me too
Besides, everybody's mamma cry sometime
And you know everyone gotta die sometime
And grandma said I had a cousin in Minnesota that I ain't even know about ya know
And just last week he got his brains blown out
And so his little funeral was being held today
I'm dressed in black Versacci and mad respect I payed
But whoever shot my cousin sure wet up that poor bastard
Cause the wake and the funeral was strictly closed casket
But yo, they had his picture on the program and oh damn
They had his picture on the program and oh damn
Starred at my cousin on that program and I couldn't even speak
That's the kid that I shot last week",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-nice-double-em-lyrics

Fatter than Conan?the Barbarian with the  spare?hand
Never vegetarian, I walk with heavy hands
I'm a scary man
Split ya' spine in two places
Known for chokin' MCs with their own shoe laces
Fools take this for jokes but the wise take heed
I make ya' insides bleed for what I transcribe or need
And I believe  that you would need a newer breed of true MC's
To influence these with what you do with on beats
The melody deprived blessed in disguise
Cuz' now you write my name in smoke and spell it in the skies
A-L and I, pronounced ""Ali,"" not ""Alley"" or ""Ahlay""

I'm on ya' like white on rice
Spots on dice
Hip hop vice
Only Ali rock that nice
Take cops' advice and put ya' hands in upper regions
Scarin' y'all like Steven
Only the best leave breathin'
I'm seein' things that ain't been seen yet by the average eye
We can battle at the dinner table
Let the cabbage fly
Amplify your fear as ya' step into my forest
Cuz' I'm hungry like the plant in the Little Shop of Horrors
Got you anticipatin' waitin' for my chorus
You tryin' to get saved by the bell like Zack Morris
All you saw is me sayin' what you ain't think l'd say

C semicolon backslash'll leave your wack ass lost in the sauce

Left cipher's revolvin' like the Wheel of Fortune
From Jew town and the Chi to the swap meet on

And drop jewels like a crackhead in a ghetto pawn shop
I elevate the mundane like a Chi-town train

And they say I'm so vain for a little no-name

Eye of the Storm,Rites of Passage,2000,"It's like two thousand and something
You know what I mean?

I think like, if I rock?it?

Yo, my enemies?are gonna' always talk
But when the?mics on they couldn't bust grape and welch's backyard with spikes on
I said ""Buenos noches,"" but they ran like roaches with the lights on
Better dust yourself off 'fore you step off in my strike zone
Matter of fact, gimme' your keys
Ya'll MC's are gonna' have to hike home
Ali move like a python and strike like Mike Tyson
I run up in your cipher spinnin' hyper than a cyclone
With the right poem to leave your eardrums twice blown
Nice goin'
The way I push it way back
Ya'll might get struck by stray facts and come clean like Ajax
With the way that I say that ya 
Besides ya'll should break camp before ya'll get ransacked
Now stand back
I blow the tops off MC's
To get my rocks off with ease
Let some shots off in the breeze
Figuratively speakin' you're on thin ice
With no motivation or appreciation for life
And like my man  said ""these words are always rhyme, I just happen to be the one puttin' 'em together this time""
And I'm aware that ya'll expect to hear some
Power packs are why  tracks put our city on the map

The eye of the storm is where I operate
I'm surrounded by chaos but I concentrate
As I- as I keep the focus things'll never be hopeless
Cuz' the eye of the storm is where I op

Yo, I push the god knowledge inside of them
Clean up the messes
Style impresses cuz' it's tighter than
Big lessons dresses 
Use my knowledge as my vitamins
I'm on  professes
Ali's known for makin' them educated guesses
The puzzle solver walkin' the streets with no revolver
To ya' 
From emotional waters 'fore they disolve ya'
You'll never be complete until your soul is at peace
And the environment'll make you a beast out on these streets
I hate the term playa hater
I'm an imitator hater
Cuz' this world can be a very cold place of innovators
So I slay the average rapper and the average rap producer
I tell you like them Puerto Rican girls say, ""no me gusta""
So I use the peace keepin' skills
That's my thesis
When I die I'm tryin' to rest in peace
Not rest in pieces
I know I'm not Jesus but I teach with parables
And leave freaks hysterical
Even my life's a miracle

In the eye of the storm is where I operate
I'm surrounded by chaos but I concentrate
As I- as I keep the focus things'll never be hopeless
Cuz' the eye of the storm is where I op

You wanna' live on this Earth young minds, stick with me
We'll change our sloppy graffiti into refined caligraphy
Evolve our beat boxin' into a fine symphony
And change our cloudy thinkin' to a new epiphany
Achieve 
Solvin' mysteries
Helpin' sisters be dignified the way Allah created them to be
So while the average rapper sits back and jacks his jaws
I try to manage my affairs and give you some advice for yours
Now boys
Think about my language and the things I do
I seek to express me, and not to impress you
And yes it's true my whole crew is always tryin' to increase
But when Ali's over the beats forget about it, capish?
I teach for the universal but first of all for the streets
Cuz' it's the young  header rude boy I'm tryin' to reach
I say peace cuz' I gotta finish up before dawn
It won't be long and we've already reached the eye of the storm

The eye of the storm is where I operate
I'm surrounded by chaos but I concentrate
As I keep the focus things'll never be hopeless
Cuz' the eye of the storm is where I op

Shit Happens,Scribble Jam Volume 2,UnKnown,"Intro (Brother Ali speaking):
I have this dream all the time shit. Everybody has sex dreams
Mine, you know they gotta be fucked up at the end
Like get caught cheatin' and shit
I can't keep my shit right. I can't. So far that is
Chorus:
Be careful, what you pray for
Cause you just might get it and it might come true
Nine times out of ten you're not prepared for
How to react if it happens to happen to you
Be careful, what you pray for
Cause you just might get it and it might come true
Nine times out of ten you're not prepared for
How to react if it actually happens to you
Verse One:
Tours is like Ground Hog Day
Everyday is exactly the same
And don't shit change but the Hanes and the name of the cities that we're rappin' in
Set the Kool-Aid stand up and hope to pack them in
One day this lady got caught in my eye
Like Rosario Dawson standin' off to the side
Please
My post show game is none other
Gentleman mack, elderly cat stalk the young Brother
Who did you steal this section of the floor from?
Underground rap show she stuck out like a sore thumb
She write for whatever-the-fuck magazine
And she got up on the guest list just to come and check this
Artist that she heard about
Word-A-Mouth
Little did she know she could bat her eyes and turn 'em out
Here's me
Forrest Whitaker, pretty baby maker
Never mind I've been wearing these same pants for three days
Chorus 
Verse Two:
Don't get me wrong
It's not in my personality to cheat
But I'm a charming motherfucker in my sexual peak
And I swear to God it's not done out of greed
Intelligence ?, y'all see where this is gonna lead
I've just seen the bootie in it's natural habitat
But never as fat as that
Shit god damn
She can't even keep the elastic back of her jacket down
Shit, she came across the street and made a clappin' sound
Got hips like the holsters of a gunslinger
One thing touchin' her thing will make your nuts tingle
Send a shiver up the middle of your spinal cord
Lettin' your mind explore that's what the vagina's for
Humpin' it like I got up in the Final Four
On a wild card, double team and it's time to score
Let a primal roar like a fuckin' dinosaur
And filled her with a pint or more of fine white slime dijour!
But once the life juice leaves your little head
It makes your big one want to take back everything you said
And now I can never look my kids in the eye
I would probably rather die then to live this lie

Twinkle in the ivories
You know what a twinkle in my eye could mean

And provide the means for driving with the highest beams

Uh, I dry my shield and then they fought me fearless

If I don't back up off you then I'm after smashing on ya
Don't be sad because the magic's over
I'm still on the path and better than I had been if I hadn't known ya

Taught us how to climb, and showed us how to fall
If you should drop a line and I don't grab the call
I'll catch you on the other side when you're standing tall
Yes y'all
It pushed me to the threshold
I know just what the spirit does when the flesh folds
So alive, close the eyes and let the breath flow
Give and forgive, or get and get forgetful

Truth teller,?truth?yeller
Proof, Evi-dence, yes,?yes
It's very important to me that?whatever I have to say is worth saying
Uh-huh

Full grown father of four still in search of father figures
Hard to feel at home here in the body that my trauma lives in
Self-hatred still my opposition
I chop a parcel out the wisdom I've been given out atop the rhythm
I'm not a victim or a liar and I'm not afraid
Offer me a kingdom, if it's wrong, I'll walk away
I know my talent versus fame isn't adding up
Folk that know me throwin' shade said I ain't wanted it bad enough
Seen so many change and get strange for the spotlight
If that's what you mean brother, you couldn't be more right
I'd rather feel shame than an atom's weight of arrogance
Mention deaths name, prepared for it, ain't fearing it
Atheists describe the God that they don't believe in
See we ain't even at odds cause I don't feel that neither
I know we come from a source that's much realer
A cause that all the sleepers keep concealing, seekers overcome the amnesia

Feel the heartbreak bleeding all through my songs
My Atmosphere brothers brought me along
I carry on for the love of love, and for the hope of hope
I feel it from above, and hold the moment close
Soak up the rawness, floating all through my songs
The Al Taw'am twins kept me strong, I soldier on
For the love of love, and for the hope of hope
I catch a sudden buzz, an overdose

I got a knock up on my door, it was the FBI
""Can't come inside without a warrant but I'll talk here on the steps awhile""
They want to question my travelin', what's the harassment?
Power obsessed authoritarians to test what I'm channelin
He said his mission keep the innocent from dying
Had to laugh a little bit to keep from crying
I sigh as if we don't know about the COINTELPRO
And devilish drones that rain hell into homes
Never an empire rose without blood on its hands and face
They hate the poets for exposing to channel the rage
Sacred space whether I'm in Iran or Lebanon
Or the southside of Chicago or Sudan
The power in the song is the truth not the performer
My question for you is where's the honor
In bothering a father in his home in pajamas 
on his birthday
In front of all his daughters, next time call the lawyer

I'm part of this resistance, blistering through my song
The great Chuck D kept me strong
Sound the alarm, for the love of love, and the hope of hope
This is what justice does, put you in their scope
My steadfastness, blastin' this dope ass song
Cornel West never led me wrong
I soldier on, for the love of love, and for the hope of hope
For every one of us, that hold the rope that won't be broke, nope

Truth yeller, truth yeller
Bring it back though let me finish

I'm from a long line of writers and teachers
And spend all of my time with guides and seekers
And criminals and preachers
Sifting through the secrets just to kick 'em through your speakers
These tears just flowing my whole life long
Look in the mirror, still see my mom
I'm writing songs for the love of love, and for the hope of hope
This is from dusk to dusk, and pray they hold me close, ghost

I spit directly from the people that originated
All of that?shit?you faking, think?that imitation is amazing
You need to?fix your faces quickly 'for your spirit get eliminated
I've been initiated, strictly by invitation
To the order of the Samurai, so this is sacred
Revealing by right, he's heat but I'm light
He feel it shine bright, deleting all hype
I'm not shining, I'm growing, every rhyme is a poem
You been already knowing, I been trying to told 'em
Still grinding and groping, still prying it open
Still divinely controlled and I honour the moment
Been around the globe and always finding pieces of me
Reason to breath as deep as the sea
Pay the ticket price and speak it for free
Lay my head on any bed and then eventually dream of the key
I arrive clear, no dye here
But the colors of the tears cried here might appear on my beard
Uh, the dust I carry on me is just a ceremony
Because it bears the stories of the ones that came before me
You witness the glory, the gifted oratory
That I distribute as the richness of the poor and holy
They thought the floor could hold me, they thought the sky confined me
They thought the prison of the earthly body might define me
They thought because that God is out of sight, I follow blindly
Anything outside of space and time cannot be timely
Allow me, glad tidings to the strangers
Ain't concerned with being famous or how many hits their page gets
That are happy being nameless, and absent from your papers
And could never be swayed by someone clapping in their faces
Hatred can't degrade them, praise could never raise 'em
Their glamor can't be faded by no passing entertainment
And that's the generation where I catch my inspiration
The manuscript they're saving is the one I scratched my name in
This is by love, to love, through love, true love
Turn the lights down and turn the tune up

I'm that ticket to get you higher than a mezzanine
Nosebleed, methamphetamine
Protein, USDA grade: totally lean
If you holding up the wall, you know what I mean
Promethazine fiend, watch women in lululemon
Female geneticist: I study girls in jeans
Violent with the double-entendres
The weed-whacker that'll strike the bong and hit ganja
Then cut a rug before I drink Mary's blood
Regurgitate it, praise it then raise the murder rate in the club
Sociopath, I will slice the tat off a thug
And then spit a slug in his mug and leave the hands of time with a nub
Sick shit, with a torn meniscus
Dikembe Mutombo ordering jumbo shrimp with a pimp
In Red Lobster eating buttermilk biscuits
I'm proud, young, gifted
Somewhere in between red and green, getting lifted
I'm half of the planet when the sun gets eclipsed
Shit, I'm Steve Harvey at the African Day Parade
Drinking Tanqueray with gators on, playing spades with Issa Rae
Black Jew screaming on New York avenues
I'm blacker than black people's desire for new shoes
Fast, you couldn't catch him if you was Mohamed Sanu
In fact, I'm blacker than running numbers in sou-sous
On a cruise with Patti LaBelle screaming church hymns and blues
The fuck's blacker than that?
Came out the womb on Halloween
With an affinity for thirteen and black cats, does it get any clearer?
Walk barefoot under ladders in a house of broken mirrors
Staring into what I am, space-time continuum
At the minimum, math and helium gases slash
Malware to make your hologram crash
I totally get why you fear me
'Cause I'm what existed before the Big Bang theory, I'm-",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-situated-lyrics

They're keeping me awake
Keeping me awake
Tryna make me break
Deepest?darkest?secrets and escapes
Keeping?me awake
Keeping me awake
Tryna see me?break

The next time I disappoint you, just listen to this
And remember that I warned you, I'm a hypocrite
Filthy me, guilty plea, throw me
On the mercy of the court
Worthy of every curse you've ever thought
Homesick and heartbroken, I remember God
And the dragon of the treasure chest of all that I forgot
Use my hard heart as a rock to break the lock
I tried to spend the spoils of a war I hadn't fought
Blocking off the block because we're plotting a parade
Time to celebrate all of the progress that we made
Mediocre strayed and we're the only ones that stayed
Never mind the fact that it's been mostly a charade

All the deepest darkest secrets and escapes
Keeping me awake
They're keeping me awake
Tryna see my break, break
All my deepest darkest secrets and escapes
Keeping me awake
They're keeping me awake
Tryna make me break

Anything of benefit I ever did has been a gift
Truth is I ain't ever did shit
High percentage is just projected what my image is
The rest of it is just coincidence
Filled my stomach and I emptied my lungs
My dollars are consumption and my charity coins
I elevated my claims, even though the state is the same
Now you're saying you're so inspired
Yeah I know, that's the point
As I'm spitting this, I know that you're hearing all these confessions
And considering I must be so sincere with it
I'm sitting here baring it, my ego get embarrassed
Started tearing at the intention I claim
Made it a chain and started wearing it
He don't ever slip or sleep, he just let me trick and treat
Myself into the costume I designed to keep my picture sweet
Got me walking in the street, indiscreet
Long as I can say that this outrageousness is inner peace
Listen please
All hail the veils I wear like they're regalia
Add another layer to the fray, the more the merrier
Broke my arm patting my fat ass on the back
Thought I won 'cause a saint was kind enough to sign the cast

My deepest darkest secrets and escapes
Keeping me awake
Keeping me awake
Tryna see me break, uh huh
All my deepest darkest secrets and escapes

Keeping me awake

Red,Secrets & Escapes,2019,"Yo, every time I write I start reverting to my life
It feels more important than?any?words that rhyme
And?what I mean is this: I?can't rap for other rappers
My truth has to be told, if not then I'm an actor
I played roles til it didn't feel redeeming
I save my bread when it's earned more than when I'm scheming
My day's light compared to feelings in the evening
At night, I'm an angel on my shoulders wearing demons
I wear my heart on my articles of clothing
And play my cards, I'm just an artist who ain't folding
I saved my scars for the day I started flowing
In the same way the hardest shit to learn's a part of growing
Told the world my dreams and lived through it
And I came apart at the seams, then I renewed it
Wipe the slate clean
Validate everything I knew since I was eighteen
Might just rock a gold chain like B.A. from A-Team
My God, these are not words with empty promises
These are from a person who's immersed in where the drama is
I thought the feeling was dead
So I wrote a second verse but kept the first one instead
My God, if these four walls could talk
My drum chops have seen it all
His eyes were dead
Mine always been bloodshot red

Midwest or Venice
First or second amendment
Shell casing or penmanship
They felt it when I sent it
I'm sixth sense, sentence sensitivity is vintage
Busy curing sicknesses that's yet to be invented
Engendered, respected, Nth degree is endless
The main emphasis is to be felt instead of mentioned
Man listen, I step up on this land pissin'
And rocking a chunky gold link chain of transmission
My bandwidth is blistering
Ancestors hissin' and
Standing on the brick to push my passion through this instrument
My God, extended breaks to invite me
And dilate my peoples
 by standards can't indict me
I got a brother named Amir Sulaiman
If you know my name and not his, then something's wrong
Word bond, here's a bar he spit, I wanna honor it
He said it's counterfeit to think that cowardice lengthens life; bravery shortens it
This is the author of the warrior poets
The inordinate glorious that slaughtered by the lawless
I know that all the rawness that the hearts could harness
The healing tears applauded on performance, flawless
My God, if these four walls could talk
Drum chops have heard it all
His eyes were dead, mine always been albino red
My God, if these four walls could talk
Drum chops have heard it all
His eyes were dead, mine always been albino red

Tell me you ain't got fears and hopes and schemes
Tell me?you?know this life?is very rarely what it seems
Show?me all the stars that light your sky
What you can't seem to say I see inside

Melt the Mona Lisa through a broken speaker
Euphoria frame me from my frozen fever
Ether, feel it bleeding through the sheets
Lose sleep, loose leaf, you usually read 'em and weep
Peep, my eyes closed, scribe the scroll and watch y'all life unfold
I strike a note, recite 'em and excite your silent soul
Multiply mi mami slide me some hummus
Kinda flame that make the baby grow gorgeous
Great performance, stay late, savor the rawness
Like the steaks are enormous
Hit notes to make the chords that string together the moments
Lord willin', can't avoid the feeling
That we'll get caught for stealing
I pray we make good on a smidgen of all that we've been given
Time that you and I been spending packed a lot of living
Rough draft, I was picked to rock the first round without revision
Can't allow them to cloud our vision
No that's not in our composition
Out of my mouth I spout this ism, listen
Teardrops in my eyelids, screen shots of a life lived
Speaking on through the silence
Please do not try to buy this, it's priceless
That's a lot of prices, either deny it or dive in
Either get loving or lying, either way you ain't surviving
Cross roads in a crisis, I still remember the night when
You let go of that code, rolled over in bed and said it just like this

Tell me all your dreams
Tell me you ain't got fears and hopes and schemes
Tell me you know this life is very rarely what it seems

I took a?vow?to spray the?uzi til the day they do?me
Do the right thing ain't a movie to me
Appear horny if you ain't raisin the stakes, then what you sayin' to me
I shoot the hard eight spit street nine
Hypocrites trying to Bogard whats mine to bolster your shine
Y'all got lines in your costumes and cast rooms
This is incense in the back room kickin' your next tattoo
The big man ship has officially landed
Steady layin' hands on this  planet
A full-blown fan and always one of the baddest
That's just part and parcel of my starving artist status
The hunger for greatness is utterly ageless
Bubble up on your playlist dumping blood on the pavement
You're playing with some bonafide born troubadours
Bursting through the studio doors hunting for superstars
Confiscating all pros who smack around and fanny pack for rapping over vocals
We keep surviving, weaving and bobbin'
Increasing involvement and feasting and fawning
While neat people party, the inmates are free in the asylum
How not to be a product of this weak ass environment
Y'all gotta feel me though the mic hand is regal
The light beams will reach you, they can heal a broken people
Regardless of the freeze we on the good shit still
All eyes shukka Sean P and Bushwick Bill

We are the good man
Yeah, son
Trust me
Am I a Blood, clot him?
And he just listens to what may I say

Check it!
Time favors the spit kickers and rhymesayers
Ev and Ali is my family, they stay in my prayers
Movin' on up like Dave Chappelle and John Mayer
Singapore eatin' a steam cake that's nine layers
Promoters owe so all my notes be promissary
Tom and Jerry rappers don't want none like monasteries
I'm honorary every verse is a doctorate
Collecting PhDs over degrees that doctors get
Where we live ain't just a trap they had to seal us off
The money, power, and respect is what they kill you for
I'm still involved even if the tried to kill us all
You a flash in the pan, you not hot, that's just a menopause
Passport pimpin' on the plane soon as i get a call
It's like, ever since I was born a nigga been absorbed
 Rios band for that Dutch river fall
Till writing iron made us tag graffiti on Brazilian walls
My elevation is high, you're just peaking
A mountain of rhymes, you need a Sherpa just to reach them
Or read him, cause when you see him, you start bleedin' from your eyes
Though I'm seeing from third, I never needed your reply
Leave you wheezin' on the curb, just for speaking to me wrong
We ain't friends just cause you rap, we don't have to get along
That's gonna have to be okay, go ahead and make a diss record
Rap your little heart out, feel better

You wake up in emergency, I wake up in the custody
We both'll wake up on the news
I'm always on my post til they release me
To do the least or the most, whatever need be
Can't decrease me or DB even briefly
A champion, stand as a chief until we breathe free
They either honor me or shower me with cruelty
Neither one has anything to do with me
But if you do judge, do it according
To the reality that this is me while being tortured
I often think of myself as lost, and
Only thing for certain is a curtain and a coffin
Learned my first song from my mama then 
I watched 'em
Zip her face up in the bag and drag her off and
I'm not being dramatic, I'm just playing back the highlights
Things I remember more vivid than my eyesight
Forgive me, give me just a minute get my mind right
Don't expect me spit 'em in a straight line, man

I ain't scared, I ain't scared no more
Done seen the worst of the worst
I ain't scared, I ain't scared no more

And the red light got me?in?my zone, got?me in my zone


We all know?who the greedy are
Stockpiling all the fly shit that other people want, just to flaunt
That's something we've seen before
What if the freshness that you collect is people's hearts
Here's a thought
Look at these big headed fools, climbin' up their pedestals
Where do you think you go from there, Bring me back a souvenir
Go declare your greatness in the open air
Throw a show and tell 'em they supposed to stare, I don't think you're so prepared
Nobody's sober where there's followers and shares
And eyeballs for modeling your wears
When you hashtag goals they cheer, then the trolls come near
You're getting old and your frozen in your cold despair
They used to push drugs to freedom fighters not to see 'em riot
People divided that's likely to be inspired
Now they got a TV station 'side they pocket
And an ego turn a mosque into a mosh pit
Watch It


[Hit that like button
Smash that like button
Demolish that]

Bout to go live right now, here go that sound

I ain't ever been along cause the cameras on and the red light zone, got me in my zone
I'm bout to get on they can't hold me back
I might not be global but I know that's where they know me at
[I was a 17 year old kid
I was going viral on the internet
I'm the king of getting my Instagram deleted
I was clotheslining girls
I was having fun with this
I was viral bro, I was viral
I want everyone to know I uploaded this shit, like you know what i'm saying
What you tryna get some views, some plays
I didn't even have the right platform where everyone can hear my voice, like yet
I'm a human being at the end of the day, you're breaking a person, bro]

Okay right back
We're like fast food in the commercials
No matter if it's booty or its virtue
We sure use all the angles and the filters
And language and the big words
To make something look beautiful that hurts you
I assure you the lost narcissist, boomerang played the part of Marcus
The hard of marketing department for a walking carcass
Hard to tell a thirsty harlot from a starving artist
We're on the same walk of shame asking where our star is
Saw my face tattooed although I ain't wanna be rude
Start dropping bad news on them
The gods honest truth is I fall in that human column
And I know if you sir are the problems I'm usually hotter than, woo
And I'm trying to tell the truth
But I've seen all of the gimmicks that'll get you 15 minutes
And the difference between the real thing and the image
And the one thing that I glimpse is privacy's a privilege",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-red-light-zone-lyrics

I threw this letter away five times 'fore I signed and sent it
I put my handprint in the patent of what I invented
I scribe a sentence that defying all your laws and limits
I don't feed the machine, I feed human beings
Don't perform for the form, but what it truly means
Ain't no such thing as beauty queens
Love and service are the stuff of movie scenes
I'm at my best when I can disappear
The only time that I show up is when I'm insincere
Listen here: there's no such thing as ""isn't fair""
There's only what you keep and what you kill
I know you feel me there

Blind dog with a seeing eye, man—interesting pair
If I wasn't bald, I'd whip my hair

Ayo, depending on the day, and depending on what I ate
I'm anywhere from twenty to thirty-five pounds overweight
I got red eyes, and one of 'em's lazy
And they both squint when the sun shines, so I look crazy
I'm albino man, I know I'm pink and pale
And I'm hairy as hell, everywhere but fingernails
I shave a cranium that ain't quite shaped right
Face type: shiny, I stay up and write late nights
My wardrobe is jeans and faded shirts
A mixture of what I like, and what I wear to work
I'm knock-kneed and got a neck full of razor bumps
I'm not the classic profile of what the ladies want
You might think I'm depressed as can be
But when I look in the mirror, I see sexy ass me
And if that's somethin' that you can't respect then that's peace
My life's better without you actually
To everyone out there, who's a little different
I say damn a magazine, these is God's fingerprints
You can call me ugly but can't take nothing from me
I am what I am doctor you ain't gotta love me

If you would please turn in your bible
To beauty tips according to Forest Whitiker
In the third chapter of the third line
Brother Ali would you please read to the choir for me son

Now first thing's first, I don't judge you for the weed smoke
But I can hear your daughter yellin' 'daddy, please dont'
And it's not once or twice, but every damn night
Man there's somethin' goin' on up in here that ain't right
Now man to man, I can understand
They like to stress a brotha out, man we cuss each other out
But you crossin the line by puttin your hands on 'em
And nobody ever told you not to hit a damn woman?""
Boy, I can tell that my presence was painful
Breathin' truth down his neck it must have felt like a strangle
His eyes flashed confusion, wavin' his hands around
He's used to raisin' his voice on people to back 'em down
See this is specifically why I left the pistol in the linen closet
Pullin' this shit, if he was taller I woulda went and got it
Damnit man, I'm in the right and I'm civilized
But little boys really ain't used to bein' criticized
First off scooter, take the bass out your voice
I'm respectful with mine and yo you makin' a choice
Here and, understand it's only once that I warn you
Make a move, make a threat, I'll make it rain knuckles on you
I ain't a woman or a baby dawg, I'm out of your league

She stuck her head out on some keep your temper shit
Little man gon' say “Close the door, mind your business, bitch”
Ha, now that's sweet, just what I needed it, it seemed that
He invited my right fist for a party on his left cheek
I didn't mean to seem rude so I accepted
But arrived a half a second early, right cross connected -
Oh, staggered him, just by taggin' him
Mr. tough guy, one punch bring out the fag in him
Little man could make moves that I couldn't
He cut and tried to foot it, now how should I put it
I stood at full posture and swatted him down the staircase
Bare knuckles to bare face, all punches knew their place
Airport style, the second one take off, the next one land
Learn some respect young man
He glanced down for the brick on the ground
Fist still clenched up I'm still stickin' his crown
He's in the jaws of the most turbulant blitz in the world
So fuck hittin' ya' girl tonight you're hittin' the ground
I said somebody need to beat your ass
And then teach your ass, and I'm sorry I can only do half
And while his mellon swell up, a police cruiser pull up
He hopped out all puffed up with the holster of his gun up
Ready to protect and serve
And it's in his nature to .38 ya' if you're testin' his nerves
He helped the wife-beater stand up
But not before he helped Brother Ali into some handcuffs
And you can imagine my surprise
When his girl came down the stairs with tears in her eyes
And a phone in her hand, holdin' her man

I've seen the noose and will not get lynched by the industry
Nor will I have a A&R pimpin me stickin his thing in me

That if I'm there for my team they're there for me
For real, I be diligently killin the soliloquies
Of these millipedes that try to pass themselves off as ill MC's
I weave a web of words so intricately
That the English dictionary lacks an adjective to fit me

I might jump on the stage and start hollerin rhymes
Maybe bend your back around and make you swallow your spine
Cause it's clear you ain't seen no one this tight in years
When I sing I can bring Brian McKnight to tears
I have to consume, Ali capture a room

When you ain't even keeping the rhythm the DJ is spinnin'
Calm down little camper, I've got the answers
You should fuck exotic dancers
You should grow a pair of tits and some antlers
It doesn't matter turn it up, what the fuck you think that amp's for?

I right wrongs, write rhymes, write my name in the snow
And I could use all of that to bend the frame of your ho
And I should but instead I'll just pay the waiter and go
But if I didn't have a wife, yo your kids'd be albinos
Your respect is like a stick in the grass
Mean mugs and tree hugs, I'll go on without it
I wear my toilet paper so that y'all can kiss my ass
With your tongue out and write a love song about it

Write that shit inside of your book full of funny little scribbles
The love comes in vomit, the money comes in dribbles
The Minnesota missiles, self taught
Communication, mutilation, holding pictures of your sister naked

Ha ha, You too drunk to walk down the stairs
And now you standing here choking on my pubic hairs
Telling me your name as if you think the brother cares
If you keep bumping your gums we can fucking take it there

I make a room full of punk rocks stop and do wop
Wrestle shots from a cop, and ask him who's your pops

And hoop dreamers ballin' with blisters on they hands
With chains danglin' from the rims
Pain strangles 'em from within
Till' the belt around the arm makes the veins stand at attention
I try to block it out with a bed sheet, the moonlights as a curtain
Cause I'm not comforted by red and blue lights when I'm hurtin'
Mommy loves you yeah I knew but I wasn't certain
Cause the lenses through which she views life wasn't workin'
As a boy she told me ""wait til' your father to come home""
I'm 24 still waitin' for my father to come home
And some parents only touch they children when a whips brought
That's why bad kids do bad shit, just so they could get caught
And get touched, this growing up shit's rough
That's a big part of why were so mixed up
Shit we don't have Bar Mitzvah's
We become men the first time our father hits us
And we don't open gifts up
Sister Regina from across the street is beautiful
But for 50 bucks ain't nothing she won't do to you
Used to be premium pussy now she used up
For that same 50 bucks she got to do some new stuff
Whatever it takes for you to pull the dollars out
If you don't intervene then there's a day she'll turn her daughter out
Speaking of kids I'm fixing lunch for my first born
I had the windows wide open cause the weather's warm
That's when the greatest hits of Donnie Hathaway
Got interrupted by a drive-by shooting half a block away
Faheem was in the window, he didn't get hit though
All praise to Allah

I see all this from the desk that I write my rhymes from
Pen starts to scribble on it's own my minds numb
But you can call me modern urban Norman Rockwell

Picket Fence,Shadows on the Sun,2003,"I was up and out my mothers house at 17
Been a grown ass married man ever since
Family reunions, I'm talked about but never seen
Cause I learned that some of them can be your nemesis
Got a lot of scars on me, I'll now tell you the stories
If, you promise not to take offense
Homie, sit back then, Ant bring the beat in
I'll try to find a place that starts to make sense now
The first time I was pushed out blind
Cold and naked, spanked on the ass to breathe
An immigrant from heaven on earth with the work visa
I announce my self with gasps and screams
Before blighted white supremacy heisted my innocence
I was living out life behind the picket fence
Happy go lucky scared of no one
With the only exception, I'm allergic to the sun
Didn't know I had a image that a camera couldn't capture
100% Allah's manufacture
But then came the laughter, and outside I'm battered
Picket fence shattered
I saw my self as bastard tagalong, harassed and spat upon
By the children of slave masters who passed it on
The saddest songs been sung at the hands of who I call the race from hell
Its a disgrace from hell
Fell face first in the self hate
Burst into tears when I hear my own hellish name cursed
If I seem timid, its only because every mirror that I saw back then had the
Earths ugliest human being in it
And with that said, they would kick me till they got tired or I act dead
And I, have to tell ya'll that the obvious part
That I always feel free when I'm talking to god
Alone on the playground, Friday afternoon
And the, old sister who hums gospel tunes
I saw her notice getting closer
She approached me and put a knowing hand on my shoulder
And booked my feelings
Cause she looked at me in a way that adults very seldom look at children
And with the wisdom only earned by years
She read my thoughts and she welled up with tears and said
""You look the way you do because you're special
Not the short bus way, I mean that God's gonna test you
And all of this pain is training for the day when you
Will have to lead with the gift God gave to you
Grown folks don't see it but the babies do
And there's a chance that you can save a few""
And time will prove that, she started my movement
She didn't tell me to take it - she told me to use it
The second time poppa ripped the womb open early
And exposed me to the coldness of life prematurely
Where mom's love used to live, now housed denial
And when that decayed, it made it bitter and spiteful
But me and my runaway, we share something special
Rode into the sunset, can barely touch the pedals
No strings attached, screaming, ""fuck Geppetto""
We may live in the gutter, but we cling to each other
A week before my son came, I caught a bad bounce
And had to step to mom with my hands out
And momma proved the two of us could not live in that house
She lied to the police so they would throw us in the streets
And separating from you, is something that I feel I must do
Its not that I don't love you, its more that I don't trust you
Its been a year since I've seen a living relative
And it's just now that I'm starting to live
But while I'm sitting here, choking on tears wishing that I didn't care
Feeling all alone in this hemisphere, I swear upon everything I hold dear
And then my wife comes near, and I hear a voice whisper in my ear
""You're going through all of this because you're special
Not no superstar shit, I mean that God had to test you
And all of this pain has been training for the day when you
Would lead us with the gift God gave to you
Your parents might not see it but your babies do
And there's a chance that you can save a few""
And time will prove that, she started my movement
She didn't tell me to take it, she told me to use it
So I use it",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-picket-fence-lyrics
Star Quality,Shadows on the Sun,2003,"Yo it's the Ahk in the flesh, of course I'm fresh
Yes, I'm livin for the funk like I was Lord Finesse
Last night I screamed till I lost my voice I guess
Had a few things left to get up off of my chest
Like I'm, facing the fact that I'm not, what my mom wanted
Only gold plaque that I got, had the Qur'an on it
I flipped your eviction notice over, wrote a song on it
Like to hear it, here it go
, light your spirit, clear your soul
If I would've known that tonight was Ladies' Night
I would've stopped and swabbed my balls with the baby wipe
In the van, Hold your sorry little life in my hand
Watch me toss it in the sky and swing right for the stands
Battling me is like trying to ride your bike in the sand
I'mma eat one more helping, then I'm, wiping my hands
And you frustrated rappers, must hate the fact
That I walk in First Ave, have so much ladies gaspin for breath
Tryin to catch me, with the ass and the chest
I ain't tryin to be rude lady, I'm just passin a test
Got enough hastle and stress, with one woman cashing my checks
I'll take the compliment and pass on the sex

We like
Brother Brother Brother, how ya making 'em get down
Come, straight to your town, vibrating the ground
Keep the people out there scared, of making a sound
Thats our policy, we step out there on Star Quality
Brother Brother Brother, how ya making 'em get down
Come, straight to your town, vibrating the ground
Keep the people out there scared, of making a sound
Thats our policy, we step out there

You ain't hardcore, you soft more than Shemar Moore
In a tight shirt sayin 'Let's slow this train down ya'll'
You stink hoes, spills a whole, lot of nothing
Got the nerve to look Ahk in the eye, you got it coming
While your woman nod her face to the beat, you tasting defeat
Whiping the waste from my cleets, between the space in your teeth
Irrigate your facial features all hung down
That little dumb frown is perfect for salt water to run down
Talk harder to some clowns, cause they need it rough
Make sure they never sleeping deep enough to dream of beating me, what
My styles a little belligerent, isn't it?
Considerin that I'm belittling them, with little more then
My pad and my pen and my sentiments
Weither its your chorus scratching, or wack track blasting
Your whole approach to rapping, is ass crack backwards
Cats'll see me in the spot and act salty
Stressing you save hip hop, you can't even save a wack party


And the preachers say
""Oh Ah Hey, Oh Ah Hah""
And the choir say
""Oh Ah Hey, Oh Ah Hah""
And the preachers say
""Oh Ah Hey, Oh Ah Hah""
And the choir say
""Oh Ah Hey, Oh Ah Hah""

Brother Ali is two hundred, fifty pounds of 
Piss and Vinegar
Few try to sit me down, they missing limbs and
I got nothing on, but a lifestyle, black tuxedo
An Arethra Franklin record, and I'm rockin Captain Ego like
'Dun Dadda, shit get done proper
There's only three reasons Ali would need a Ramada
One; to move the bowels, two; to steal the towels
Three; Shave, shower, pray for my spiritual power
I can handle this, if my man Ant would just
Give me a chance to splatter some antics across his canvisses
Damage is unavoidable at this point
I twist joints till they pop lock, too loud and get ya knot rocked(?)
Im too proud to let you hop scotch through
The section of the Earth that I occupy, without making you testify
Best that I could do for you, is ignore you
Cause I'd probably conquer you if I explore you

Shadows on the Sun,Shadows on the Sun,2003,"(We'd like to capture your minds right now)
(What you say)
(Take you a little bit higher)
(What you say) (3X)

I like the snares loud enough to make your eyes blink from it
Only male with the Holy Grail, drink from it
I keep an eye on heaven and a ear to the street
And spread a thick layer of blood, sweat and tears on the beats
My brain rest upon the hip-hop lexicon
That I acquired in the decade of work that people slept upon
I don't rap, I recite the prayers of the inner soul
Of the slave ships' human cargo
Seemingly meaningless rappers flood the market
With shit that make me pace in my room until I rip the carpet
I'm fit to start up this next millennium
Swingin the grappling hook at cackling crooks to finish em
The city dweller sendin telegrams from Neverland
The better man, kind now, kindly join the caravan
We're like a rock band that pack contraband
And won't hesitate to stomp a man into the rocks and sand
Brother Ali, and if you haven't heard about me
I'm flyin just beneath your radar so y'all can doubt me
Stay on the sonar with crowbars to open minds
There's a ladder you're supposed to climb
Approach a Rhymesayer with a Buggsy Siegel sized ego
You gon' get yourself snatched out the sky, you know 
the steelo
By now, where, what, why and how
We start the revolution real time, right now

Yes, leave it to me to create hope where there was none
The human being shall cast shadows on the sun
Leave it to me to create hope where there was none
My inner soul shall cast shadows on the sun
Just leave it to me to create hope where there was none
The human being shall cast shadows on the sun
Leave it to me to create hope where there was none
My inner soul shall, my inner light shall..

I rhyme for cats up in the harbor lights
Prayin they don't starve tonight
And stay positive in the face of a harder life
My chorus light the torch for those on whom the sun set
Verses meant to speak for the voiceless
So let us never be dismayed or afraid
The ground we're walkin on is stained
With the blood of those before us who came
Soldiers in this freedom movement are too numerous to name
Cause the human soul yearns to be free, it's all the same
I rhyme for runaways prayin that they see another day
You gotta make it through the winter to feel some summer days
It's for my natives, it's history in the way their hair is braided
Elephants never forget, that's how they say it
Tell my man  in prison keep grinnin because he's innocent
And tell him that the tests we get are heaven-sent
Listen, I rap for the ones that Johnny Cash wore, the black, for
Black and white women that were turned to crackhores
And I empty everything in the bank to give for it
I empty all the days of my life to live for it
And I empty all the blood in my veins to fight for it
So I empty all the ink in this pen to write for it


I glance in the sky and see the same cloud configuration
That Nat Turner saw the day they hanged him
Resisted in the face of adversity with a fist and it was raised
One finger extended, meaning Allah be praised
Spent days in Heaven's embassy
On Qu'ran pages Allah explains this legacy
Angels doubted Adam, Jacob's brothers clapped him
And ancient Pharaohs were too brutal to fathom
If all the earth's oceans were ink and the trees were pens
You could never write the knowledge of God, it never ends
And I know it feels like the whip wounds will never mend
But it's the way of makin the oppressed prevalent men
We standin with humanity at destiny's door
Chanting the war cry, it goes, ""Never no more""
So if y'all tryina talk about the horrors you see
Feel free to tell your stories through me

There's only one God and he's not just above
There's only one man and there's only one love
Till everybody gets what I instill in my seed
For that y'all, we willin to bleed
There's only one God and he's not just above
There's only one woman and there's only one love
We doin this till all of Adam's children are freed
And for that y'all, we willin to bleed",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-shadows-on-the-sun-lyrics
Prince Charming,Shadows on the Sun,2003,"You just don't know what you do to me
If you would just give me a chance then I'm sure you'll see, baby
You just don't know what you do to me
Only God knows what can happen when you fool with me, lady

Excuse me, I mean pardon me
I mean you got me so shook I can hardly see
And I ain't tryin to be foul or disrespectful or nothin'
But I feel like the universe should tell you somethin'
You somethin', and I don't say that to be sayin' it
Many came and went, but baby, you the main event
That's why I stopped ya, it's not just the body parts
That made me watch ya, mama, you got the posture
And demeanor of the Queen of Sheba
And I'm Prince Charming, girl, pleased to meet ya
I could be your student, you could be my teacher
And I'm majorin your idiosyncrasies
And I please trouble you to use a word with 'w'
The way your lips movin got me pluggin too
You a great ten frame draped in heaven-made skin
And a faint grin, can a church say amen?
But why you catchin the bus?
With your backpockets lookin like they're ready to bust
Got a you and a me, now let's make it a us
Long story short, let me get a phone number, somethin, girl

Oh Lord

Third date, can't stop fate
I know you can relate cause I can see it in your face
It's time to take this thing we got to the next level
You know, I mean spend all our waking hours together
Surprise, showed up at your job again
And I took the time to interview all of your friends
I don't think they good enough for a queen like you
In fact, cuttin them bitches off the first thing you need to do
I was thinkin, I wanna be everything to you
I'm the only friend you'll ever need, man, that's true
Besides, I bought you a beeper, so I can reach ya
Anytime I need ya, you in the streets just
Cluckin and cluckin, and cluckin and cluckin
Girl, we could be at home gettin into somethin
So don't look at me foul and don't talk to me funny
Won't you come on through, give daddy some of that honey, girl


Did you have to go and tell the law you scared of me?
They came to mama's house and embarrassed me
Can't no piece of paper keep me away from you
You just don't understand how much I love you
I tried to tell you that I was sorry with a card
But I found it in the garbage in your backyard
Everytime I get involved it's some shit that happen
Girl, you start out nice, then forget your manners
Let me tell you that's what's wrong with these women today
How you gon' have a good man feelin this way?
It's a 30 second message that I left you today
And I know you're home cause your curtains are open
Quit playin these child-ass games, girl
I mean I got a tattoo with your name, girl
You gon' mess around and get somebody killed
Cause if I can't have ya nobody will",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-prince-charming-lyrics
Win Some Lose Some,Shadows on the Sun,2003," (2X)
And you win some, lose some
They run the gamut from hilarious to gruesome
In my life I done caught some and threw some
And I done been in some shit
But this is one that I will never forget

Testosterone theater, hallway confrontation spectacle
Time to see who got the testicles
I'm not the type to holler, ""What you wanna do then?""
Hands parallel to my shoulders, I keep it movin'
There's one thing I hate it's for another man to take control
Of a situation, you don't want me to play the role
I'm in my element on Front Street, I love the spot light
Bringin' an audience to diss me is just not right
I told him, ""Listen stupid, I know what you're here to do
But we're not gonna do it
This is a movement that I'm part of and
You're lucky I'm a righteous black man
""
And you thought I had issues now, really had 'em back then
I turned my back with the anti-climatic spitefulness
That's the worst type of diss
And I stepped off, adolescent, passive aggressive
Jesus Christ superstar to send the world a message
And there stood little man soft dick in hand
Wonderin' ""What the fuck just happened?"" Mad enough to kill a man
I turn the corner like as long as he ain't pullin' a gun
I'd rather catch a ass-whuppin' than run


I put 'em out there bad too, really they had to
I turned around, they runnin' right directly at me, they looked mad, too
A half a minute felt like a half an hour
When he got close enough I stuck him once for black power
All three bombed on me, started swingin' me around
Hollerin' ""Get him down, get him down!""
I'm like fuck that, y'all not gettin' me on the linoleum
So three white boys can start stompin' only one
They didn't hold back at all
They started bangin' my head against a steel locker like a freakin' racket ball
Grill was all busted, the locker was rusted
And when my face hit it it split my bicuspid
They spilled blood on my 'Boys N The Hood Increase the Peace' t-shirt
Now, isn't that symbolic?
I came to school a week later with a eye full of stitches
And I held my head high at them bitches
They lookin' at me like, ""Yeah y'all done fucked me up
What you think that's a thing that's gonna shut me up?""
Shit, nope, still swaggerin', still battle-rappin'
And still not givin' em the satisfaction of bein' mad at 'em",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-win-some-lose-some-lyrics
Missing Teeth,Shadows on the Sun,2003,"I dictate while most MC's lactate
Can't wait for me to smack brakes and fuck em till my sack breaks
They stand still with a little bit of spittle
Drippin off the middle of they lips tryin to light a cigarette
And I'mma watch em all choke on my vomit
Took apart, shook up they heart, they died on it
And I promise, if you could hide from this monster
You'd quit tryin to ride on my divide and conquer
Some gotta die 'fore the dumb realize
Not everyone can fly, most don't have wings
Keep takin a nap, wear a brick for a cap
Or get the fuck off the lap before you lose everything
I spit shrapnel while the villagers babble
Slice deep, pull, peel, and let the skin unravel
We're here to scrape off a layer of your make-up
So we can see what a bitch is really made of

I step off in your hoola-hoop cypher with my eyes all aglow
Walkin tall enough to make your half moon whole
You don't need to get duct-taped to the bathroom flo'
Cause I don't think your shit is flavor - but the rats do, though
You and your little bitch buddies think you're Thelma and Louise
Cause you got a drum machine and you throw jealous to the breeze
You need to respect a fuckin legend when he breathes
'fore you get a K-Swiss logo embedded in your knees
Shock the body-body, rock the consciousness
Stagger the imagination, box your esophagus
The paradigm, you step past the line
And I'll show you why the masterminds have got a fuckin axe to grind
Street magician like David Blaine with these songs
Crip-walkin through your mental corridor with metal cleats on
Slug got the weed smoke, Ant got the beats broke
And your fuckin eyebrows might grow back, but your teeth won't

Pissin their pants for opportunities and disappear into a bar stool

The way that children act when the stars come out
It would be too much like right for them to tune up their sight and then
Pursue something tight within, the blue ugly life they're in

In turn my current status lefts serpents swervin backwards

Fuck ""another summer,"" I'm the world's most accurate
Take the roughest cats and get em passionate
Shake awake the walking dead Lazarus
With off-the-head narratives, it's embarrassing
I mean, I'm the albino but y'all pale in comparison
I'm not arrogant, oh shit, well yeah, I'm arrogant
Grab the microphone out your arm so fast I tear a limb
Roman fashion, give yo soul a spasm
If you don't know find someone that knows and ask him
I'm right in front of ya, tight muthafuckin mic muzzler
Who might struggle ya, my shit's wild like that

And 6 million rappers be sharin the same three

Of Moses freein y'all with sentences, vocabulary venomous
Telling domestic horror stories
Non-fiction with the majestic oratory
Instead of concentratin on strippin the youth naked
I give em the truth naked, livin proof for the sacred
Unless I'm mistaken there's like three kind of people
Black people and white people and my people
I blister MC's and twist the debris
I got a funny knack for bringin kids to their knees
Y'all got Christopher Reeve-sized bravery tryin to play with me
Have you in fetal positions shoutin ""Get away from me!""
Every day I see rappers I wanna slap or strangle
Around they neck disaster dangles, so that's the angle
Next millennium, same percentage of em are weak
Y'all thinkin y'all can rhyme, don't even come from the streets
You got any sense at all, you mean-mug and retreat
Or end up a human pinada hung from your feet
When I told you you were tight I had my tongue in my cheek
And you ain't lookin at my team, buddy, our huddle is deep
Born to hustle on beats, I just have it within
If I had any more potential I would have to be twins
Cackle and grin when rappers begin to babble and spin away
Y'all should pick a day, to it-gay, the off the ick-day


I'm a desperado, but I guess that y'all know that already
My stick-and-move flow pattern steady
The Bro has already dissed rappers of every race
Got em together for a ""We Are the World"" remake
If Ali's fake please take this opportunity to tell he
To his face, get your infrastructure erased
When I flip damn it I'm fly, kick sand in your eye
And tell your record company to eat a shit sandwich and die
Ali's a big teddybear
Till they scream, ""Stop slammin the car door, that's my fuckin head in there!""
Your teeth are everywhere, I serve your family
And write about it in my journal like I'm Mister Belvedere
I seldom stare in the sky, only at nighttime
Envision endin your mission when I write rhymes

We came via the basement and left your face bent
And me, mister Brother Ali is the stomp-down-beat-kicker
Who walkin the streets with the so real philosophy
Until I fulfill prophecy there's no real stoppin me
Obviously I'm the bomb, believe me
Opponents come up missin and they all beneath me
I know my soldiers need me, they call and beep me
I walk the streets freely with chalk beneath me, boy
We stays gettin it on
Act hard and I probably make you strip to your thong
Dissin your song and feel you mouth to fist when you yawn
Nibblin on a rapper till the gristle is gone
I stand and sing from atop my minaret
I am a king, just ain't got my kingdom yet
And my anthem ring from the Congo to your set
I'm Alfred Hitchcock with my silhouette
Pourin Blood On Beats 
till the trumpet is blown
Coffins, I release em when I'm up in the zone
Fortune favors the brave
 and press on is the motto
Cast shadows on the sun with my bravado",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-victory-come-forward-lyrics
Bitchslap!,Shadows on the Sun,2003,"Yo Ant, kick the beat you just kicked a little while ago...

I bitchslap rappers so hard it give em whiplash
You fuckin with sleeveless t-shirts, where your tricks at?
Look left, look right, wait, where your chick at?
She findin out she walk and talk white but ride dick black
I'm a big baller, shot caller, all a y'all are runnin laps
Let me tell you little fuckers a story walkin out
You probably think you're somebody big talkin loud
You're transparent, I been starin through your Karl Kani
Art imitates life imitates art
Get it straight, slice through the mic, pourin out my heart
When it's late night we litter the landscape
Animate our dead opposition to get one last phoney handshake
I read a lot and write a lot, empty my pockets at the giro shop
Hit the cash machine for some green, maybe a ten spot
I said giro cause my Greek's a little broken
But my four-letter French works fine if you're provokin

And we killers in the morning, killers in the evening
Wake up and we yawnin, happy we still breathin
Got one longin, that's to keep eatin
We here to stay and we ain't leavin
(Rock y'all)
(Everything gonna be alright)

I'm a cross between John Gotti and Mahatma Gandhi
Look between pimp and square, you probably find me
There, in vain I solemnly swear
I'm a Guardian Angel with gang signs in the air
I spent too much time fuckin with sorry sobs
Treatin beats like bitches, flippin ménage à trois's
You ain't tryin to see us angry, pop, we already hard
Fuckin with the diplomats'll get you horribly scarred
From the cat behind the wall who play handball in the yard
To the one that run the block as head baller in charge
To the brothers with the kufis on that walk with their God
Mission Hill, Caprini Green, all ghetto scenery
Every city got us beaten up, down-trodden, creepin up
Soundbombing people, what? Till we get a equal cut
We come through straight smashin on the haters
Witness the world, the Rhymesayers


Often the brain runs
And expresses itself in words, sometimes profane ones
That's when it first occurred to me where the pain comes
From, page one in my rhyme book
If you listen closely you can picture how my line looks
You presently pressed to be restin next to me
The best of me molestin destiny wrestlin with ecstacy
The recipe for immoratlity
Flows actually be on the malls and factories
Of urban life with the laws of gravity
Audacity, you got a lot of it
Common sense should tell you not to rap against
My obvious dominance
My real life size is bigger than your confidence
Man, fuck ya'll",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-bitchslap-lyrics
Back Stage Pacin’,Shadows on the Sun,2003,"Show promoter backstage pacin (Why is that?)
He's tryin to take control of his situation
He know damn well he ain't got the money I expect to have
So I'm stuffin all the backstage in my record bag
But that's what you get when you don't pay shit
Cause I can't pay my rent on free water and chips
And if free beer means payment is what you think
BK drank one and Ali don't drink
So produce the fetti, cheddar or whatever you call it
Go get your dough split and come the hell up off it
This is how I feed my family, so I'm not gonna forfeit
And if that doesn't get it, I'm gonna go for your wallet
Let me guess - the turnout wasn't quite what you expected
Let me guess - somethin that the club owner did wrecked it
Let me guess - it's hard to pack em in in this kind of weather
And nobody wanna come and party after 9/11
That's not a MP, that's a YP - your problem
You need to have this shit planned out before callin
This is not a game to me, dog, you stealin from my family
You just gon' have to understand me
Backstage pacin

Opening act backstage pacin (Why is that?)
They tryin take control of they situation
But they mad salty cause they wore they fuckin matchin shirts
And the crowd didn't feel them and they went on first
It's the monitor, the soundman, it's the muthafuckin mics
Cats in this state are haters and the whole crowd's white
Don't sleep, your Wu-Tang impression is tight
And if blah-blah would have happened, y'all'd had em snappin
Let me guess - you and your girl had a conversation
Let me guess - she doesn't feel that you're being compensated
Let me guess - you've been rappin for a year and a half
And you mad brave when you get a little beer in your ass
At this stage y'all really need to 
show and prove
Pay attention, pay respect, pay homage, pay your dues
Be happy with your 20 minutes and your drink tickets
And go build your own scene if you think different
Hah, cause we ain't even triyn to take y'all shit
The Micronauts should have pinky rings to make y'all kiss
It's a road now, but who you think paved all this?
You're mad-face makin, you're lucky to be backstage pacin

Fee-fi-fo-fum
Watch out, muthafucka, hear the big Brother come
Like fee-fi-fo-fum
(Here it come, here it come, here it kiddy-come-come)

Brother Ali backstage pacin (Why is that?)
He tryin to take control of his situation
He's a million miles from home and his dick is on hard
And these girls are gonna make him prove that he believe in God
I'm haunted by an overfriendly poetry chick
Who keeps showin me hip cause she know that she thick
And if I met her on the street I probably wouldn't look twice
But at a show with my ego on swoll she look like
A master at applyin Maybelline with thighs you'd love to lay between
Hair was fly with raving sheen, gigantic eyes in hazel green
Revealin just enough to let me know she got it
But concealin just enough to let imagination frolic
Let me guess - my poetry makes you feel so inspired
Let me guess - the way I play off the vibe makes you excited
Let me guess - you wanna go and party after the show
And you were hopin that the two of us could capture the flow
She like, ""Come on Ali, it ain't nothin to dance""
By the end of the song, girl, I be rubbin your ass
And by the end of the night I might be fuckin you fast
Then my wife probably find a new husband and dash",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-back-stage-pacin-lyrics
When the Beat Comes,Shadows on the Sun,2003,"Open the doors, let the people in
Turn up the mics, let me speak to them
Victorious when the evening ends
It all starts when the beat begins
( VERSE 1: Brother Ali )
You're now f**kin with the show stopper
A-l-i the Brother, since ""'89's the number""
F**k ""another summer,"" I'm the world's most accurate
Take the roughest cats and get em passionate
Shake awake the walking dead Lazarus
With off-the-head narratives, it'm embarrassing
I mean, I'm the albino but y'all pale in comparison
I'm not arrogant, oh shit, well yeah, I'm arrogant
Grab the microphone out your arm so fast I tear a limb
Roman fashion, give yo soul a spasm
If you don't know find someone that knows and ask him
I'm right in front of ya, tight muthaf**kin mic muzzler
Who might struggle ya, my shit's wild like that
There's 8 million ways to stretch words around beats
And 6 million rappers be sharin the same three
But me takin the time to be creative with mine
Touch your soul till I see it in your face when I rhyme
And in the two or three seconds it may take to rewind
I hold a rapper to the flames until I make him resign
Want nobody hold your place in this rhyme, you find a space to recline
You're dead, got to stay breakin your spine
( CHORUS )
Every father, mother, son and daughter send em to me
Do not approach the ock without bendin your knees
I might be on the stage but my head's in the streets
We settle the beef (when the beats commence) -- Run-DMC
( VERSE 2: Brother Ali )
Ladies and gentlemen, Brother Ali bare the resemblence
Of Moses freein y'all with sentences, vocabulary venomous
Telling domestic horror stories
Non-fiction with the majestic oratory
Instead of concentratin on strippin the youth naked
I give em the truth naked, livin proof for the sacred
Unless I'm mistaken there's like three kind of people
Black people and white people and my people
I blister MC's and let em' twist in the breeze
I got a funny knack for bringin kids to their knees
Y'all got Christopher Reeve-sized bravery tryin to play with me
Have you in fetal positions shoutin ""Get away from me!""
Every day I see rappers I wanna slap or strangle
Around they neck disaster dangles, so that's the angle
Next millennium, same percentage of em are weak
Y'all thinkin y'all can rhyme, don't even come from the streets
You got any sense at all, you mean-mug and retreat
Or end up a human pinada hung from your feet
When I told you you were tight I had my tongue in my cheek
And you ain't lookin at my team, buddy, our huddle is deep
Born to hustle on beats, I just have it within
If I had any more potential I would have to be twins
Cackle and grin when rappers begin to babble and spit away
Y'all should pick a day, the it-day, the off-the-ick day
( CHORUS )
( VERSE 3: Brother Ali )
I'm a desperado, but I guess that y'all know that already
My stick-and-move flow pattern steady
The Bro has already dissed rappers of every race
Got em together for a ""We Are the World"" remake
If Ali's fake please take this opportunity to tell he
To his face, get your infrastructure erased
When I flip damn it I'm fly, kick sand in your eye
And tell your record company to eat a shit sandwich and die
Ali's a big teddybear
Till they scream, ""Stop slammin the car door, that's my f**kin head in there!""
Your teeth are everywhere, I serve your family
And write about it in my journal like I'm Mister Belvedere
I seldom stare in the sky, only at nighttime
Envision endin your mission when I write rhymes
History's never witnessed a mission quite like mine
And the more they try to extinguish it, the more the light shines

Shine On,The Bite Marked Heart,2012,"Don't pay me no mind, baby
Shine shine shine
Don't pay me no mind, sugar
Shine shine shine

I had seen you when the hosted seated you
In a station of mine still I'm taking my time
Made sure the moment got seized, made up my mind
Through a napkin over my sleeve, straightened my tie
Mind if I behold you through the fold of your menu
Couture, all up against you, oh lord
How could I convince you? I just met you
And I'm instantly listening to your instrumental
Poor me, I poured water inside your glass
For a brief moment our eyes had kind of met
I confess, I felt that inside my chest
Almost made quite a mess yet I digress
I would guess you're meeting a date here
I offer, 
she order hors d'oeuvres while she wait here
She brushed her bangs to clear off her face, yeah
Parted her lips and turned crab cakes to Shakespeare


The way the lady bait a trap, I'm afraid to ask
My imagination act, I run away with that
Run away with me, I swear I'm not a maniac
I'll give you that pretty diamond ring and last name to match
I ain't saying that,
 I practiced waiting in the back
I know I better make it fast before her date get back
Yeah, I place her order, grabbed the plate, relaxed
Here, let me fix my face get my game in tact
Fear, I chased the clock as I can't make it stop
I played the waiter job, made it to the table top
Time to play your cards, ace got to take your shot
Before I could speak he showed up to devastate the plot
Her real server showed up, my plan fell through
""Sir, are y'all together? Ma'am, can I help you?""
She looking puzzled, I stand without words
I'm sorry, I don't really work here - awkward


Let me explain, you see I ain't much for wait and see
So when I seen you take a seat I played maitre d'
She replied angrily, ""Mister, I can't believe
You'd stand your grown ass in this place and play games with me
Crazy freak, wait, how did you get all that food?""
I ordered from the table around the corner and brought it to you
Can't say I thought it through, ma'am it's all sort of new
But when I saw you I sort of knew I had to talk to you
And nothing in my arsenal seemed possible
So I called an audible
 Serve you? I'm honoured to
I didn't mean to bother you, I just want to watch a few
Moments of your life much like a fly on a wall would do
Never mind me, the light from your unusually bright shine blinded me
So that was all I could see, I understand if you don't want to talk to me
I'll just leave, pardon me, I'll just take this little broken heart and leave
""Wait, that was a stupid thing to do
But my date didn't show up and my table's set for two""
I pulled on my coat like, aw look at you
That's all I really wanted ma'am enjoy your afternoon
I'm through",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-shine-on-lyrics

She needed relief out on the floor
Drove from Minnesota to watch in Chicago
He forgot her name five minutes ago
Changed majors in college, you know
She could be anybody from out on the road
He trying to get out of here? You already know
He already know how to pick em
Chicks that didn't bring a whole lot of people with em
And everyone else go home but she lingers
She wants to make it known she's not a groupie
Didn't even pull out his room key
He smiled and said, ""I know, but we'll see""
The longer they talk, the closer she stand
Casually touching his shoulder and hand
He telling corny-ass jokes but she laughs
It was over before it began
She said that her ex-boyfriend was a fan
She bout to upgrade while getting back at him

High off the (energy)
Your lips can lie but your eyes can't hide
You're so high off the (energy)
She say:
Do you love me, baby? Do you love me?
Do you love me, baby?

Whether it's a dive bar or packed coliseum
Some amount of people paid money to see him
So ladies want to be with him, fellas want to be him
Lot of people never got that feeling
Spotlight gleaming, audience screaming
Really can't blame a poor girl for dreaming
Normal is too big a load to carry
At least this boy is extra-ordinary
So screwing him makes her extraordinary
At least you're at the head of the line for headliner
If he could be mine even for that hour
Somehow you'll return and might absorb that power
She's the winner of the prize
Muse of the music, getting him inspired
Convinced that he sings directly in your eyes
And these fans don't know nothing
He leave the show, they adore him and love him
But tonight you're the woman that holds him when he's cumming

High off the (energy)
Your lips can lie but your eyes can't hide
You're so high off the (energy)
And then he say:
Do you love me, baby? Do you love me?
Do you love me, baby?

He's talking about, All these bitches in the party wanna fuck me
He treats them the way he feels, which is ugly
Misery hates itself and loves company
So thirsty for that feeling
Desperately need to believe what they're hearing so
Their smiley face replace the mirror
Feed that ego, let's just feel, though
Stage got to be extra tall cause he feels low
Libido fill the holes in a beer so
Make em scream, make em cream, make em bend
Make him forget he's more naked than them
In the land of make-believe and pretend
She loves him up like a husband
But he got hundreds of these, it's disgusting
Silly little boy, do you think that she doesn't?
Buzzards need buzzards, these are not lovers
Two scared suckers masturbating on each other
Don't forget to wear your rubbers
When you're high off the..

Years,The Bite Marked Heart,2012,":
A bottle of wine and two glasses
Potato salad and that old picnic basket
Sunday afternoon spread a blanket
For so many years that we tend to lose track of it
Those years turn dreams into memories
Much oblige for every one you spent with me
Can't believe the kids that were at our feet
All moved out and began their
Own family
It still feels like just yesterday
I stood in that mirror practicing what to say
Just know when I live for the moment
My eyes glowed, held out my hand and
Felt yours on it
You don't know the power a touch like that
You have on a
Lovestruck lad
Everything I ever used to care about fade to the back
I feel that way to this day, matter of fact
:
Laughter and tears we had through the years
Like magnets, attract without fear
The sun, light that magically appeared
I recall it all and I'm glad that you're here
Laughter and tears we had through the years
The feeling of companion is near
The first touch, that can't be compared
I recall and I'm glad that you're here
:
That old tree witnessed the first love we made
I pulled out my pocket knife, gave it my name
But like all trees, he went and grew rings
And that carving got harder to read from far away
And the stress of this world, it pressed you
Made you forget you possessed something special
And all of this mess
You tended to neglect the blessing that slept directly next to you
So I'm painfully ignored by a girl masquerading as the lady I adore
And even though I lived as your husband
I can't help missing the kiss I fell in love with
What was once hugging and kissing
One day made way to fussing and
Bickering
Now cussing and no one's listening
We lost all grip on love in the midst of it
:
Laughter and tears we had through the years
The challenges you have interfere
The heartbreak and anguish we share
I recall it all and I'm glad that you're here
Laughter and tears we had through the years
We snapped and reacted out of fear
Broken promises can't be repaired
I recall it all and I'm glad that you're here
:
Those things that we say when we argue
Never go away, they become part of you
Furthermore with every new scar it grew
Ever harder to open my heart to you
I need you to believe me when I tell you that
I didn't step out on you to get
You back
I was just hungry for affection that the first time another gave attention, I was in the trap
I let her stand in for you
Trying to recapture the magic that I knew
That's why I fell for it because
When she held me in her arms, I pretended they were yours
I don't fault you for being mad at me
We were a family, I put you through a tragedy
Can't blame you for losing sanity
Rolling me over in my sleep and stabbing me
:
Laughter and tears we had through the years
Every time our anniversary nears
You show up with a picnic basket and a beer
I recall it all and I'm glad that you're here
Laughter and tears we had it appears
The best talk I've had with you in years
I'm right here where you lay my casket my dear
I'll save you place and catch you when you're here",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-years-lyrics
The Bite Marked Heart,The Bite Marked Heart,2012,"Love struck like dumb luck
See the bite marked heart come untucked
Still scared of the dark yet I’m not
'fraid to fall scale the wall that you construct
Must be the tears of joy that appeared
Rose from the morsel of soul that you bared
Crawled out of your stare Warm to my ears
Cause oh's and yeah's are all I can hear
Every wish is a prayer
Each glistening tear whispers in the ear
Convening clouds that linger in the atmosphere
Leading places for the blissfully sincere
'Fore long although sorrows overflow
Horizon no longer holds all our woes
Roll down throw out the cold ground below
Sky glows golden the whole garden grow

This oath I bestow
Triplet of tones spoken mighty slow
Echo a language from a long time ago
Trust me I know you don't even know
You're not ready
You're not ready
You're not ready
You're not ready

In the vein of an instant
Love takes us from strangers to intimate
Some day you might change what the distance is
But love can't be unmade once you witness it
Miracles, science can't quite describe
Against all odds we arrive
Immaculate hearts and clean slate minds
Mysterious souls that keep poets inspired
Marvelous mankind, wonderful woman
Each invited to the world through an act of loving
Even if they were only acting to be loving
The search of love's the origin of our becoming
And it becomes clear, two souls obliviously twist in the air

What's happening?
I've been all around world and forth and back again
And for you pretty ladies, normally I sing a song
But every now and then I like to do my rapper thang
It seems like lately you don't like the way I'm travelling
And all that's going through your mind is that it ain't the same
And even though I got you chilling where you wanna be
Right there, still you're having Nightmares like Dana Dane
Well consider this
It seems relationships today can be so hit or miss
I mean, wouldn't you say the same?
Cause even when I come home to be your Clark Kent
All you do is talk shit about them times I'm Superman
So whenever you get cabin
Fever just imagine
Yourself back in the club with them Orangutans
I mean them monkey ass niggas just hanging around
Maybe then you can appreciate my swanger thangs
Yes sir

I know that possibility seem ugly but it's true
Now he's got his career but it's me that's sitting here
And you just might miss that something special that just for you
Well, my heart long for you when I'm gone from you
Just cause I'm not all up
Under you don't mean I don't love you
To the contrariety I've been on every continent
Trying to spit and get it right and get a house for you
That's why I'm globe trotting so often
I'm trying to put that glowing dot up in your horizon
Go to school, I pay tuition, new shoes, I gave the children
With a little
Smidgen left so we can go shopping
But if I'm so honest
All that paper
Don't mean nothing
When comparing to your loving and the care you give your
Husband
Wish I could lay up on your chest and hear your heartbeat
Whispering our name together as we fall asleep
The crowd cheering as I close the show
If they only know you only let me go cause you adore me so
And understand that I'm a natural man
Got to be who and what I am
Girl let me stand next to you

Crash test dummy friend turned up to ten
Loves riding shotgun, never buckled in

Haunted Housebroken,The Bite Marked Heart,2012,"Broken, broken
Broken, broken
Broken, broken
The foundation's, The foundation's
Broken, broken
Broken, broken

I knew love could be a sunrise
Make an old man see the world with young eyes
Round each corner discover he lies
Summertime, the world full of surprise
Every sunset so it start setting in
But you will prolly never see morning again
The flame that you had was now gone in the wind
Start to get old, feel bored with your friend
Your mind start to wander, your eyes start to follow
And wind up on some young behind trying to holler
The dudes that you think are your guys ain't trying to stop you
They grab binoculars, sit back and watch the opra
What she thought was hers you now share with another
And you and someone got a secret you keep from her
Make her feel foolish for ever having trusted
Overcoming your shortcomings cause she loves you

Such a beautiful dawn and we flow right along, so warm till the sun went down
Can the day rise again? I'd wait, my friend, but I don't know how
Don't want to leave but I don't want my demons to return and haunt this house
The foundation's, The foundation's
Broken

But you know it's dead wrong that I ain't never felt so right
The heart and the mind, they don't always coincide
Evil dig a ditch, he cover it with pride
He come to webilize we weave to try and hide
The truth is on a mission to make his way to the light
It knows it has it's right to take flight
The universal laws are too strong to fight
One day it's going to set up shop in plain sight
Time can ice the pain and try to hide the stain
And glue it back together yet it's never quite the same
Even if she forgives you, she decide to stay
That memory live inside her until her dying day
She goes through the pages of history with a heavy heart
Scratching question marks next to all the precious parts
Your best memories start to develop scars
Would've never thought it'd ever fall apart but


I use to find a hiding place inside your tight embrace
Now all I see in your face are my mistakes
Too much time I done placed around snakes
Saw the apple, had to know how it tastes
I acted out of ego, acted out of lust
Acted outside of the trust we had in us
I acted out a scene from a film I had seen before
Still casted myself in that leading role
When I was finished playing, I stood there saying ""See? ""
But there was no director yelling ""Cut"" to keep it clean
The camera kept rolling and went behind the scenes
The bonus material from the DVD

2nd Time Around,The Rope-a-Dope,2009,"You gotta understand man
Personifying hip-hop
Try to

I rely on no man, but him that's speakin'. Him that lead him
Bleed on a track, like a pole vault freakish
Accident victim. 
Meanwhile beatin' up the beat via Benzi
Haters eyes gettin' wide like bench seats
I bring Maybach
. You getter get me
Wale, yeah. All them haters get me
Osmosis, now niggas get me
I spit that halitosis. You got Listerine
I'm that extreme, So haters complain
So Blame It On my Rain. You all lip sync
Wale: I turn beef into mince meat
Your condescending ways don't convince me
And I didn't know what condescending meant till yesterday
So I threw it in a rap so I'd remember that
Yeah, it ain't nothin' to me
I play the background whole time Mario 3
Gone

Second Time around

Ha. It's Brother Ali. Hey Benzi my man. You gotta forgive me
I might go a little long. I got some shit I gotta get off my chest right now
Bring it back for me

Rappers can't clap me
Jackers can't gat me
Original meaning of Jazzy Fat Nasty
I don't bite rapper's lines, I bite the captain's arm off
I don't throw shots in the air, I throw that Molotov
Cocktail, reservoir dog my collar off
Y'all scared to get that revolution popping off
You really got the guns you claim in the track
Then my question to you is who you aiming 'em at
You complain that the rap police caught you with a gat under the seat
Misdemeanored that twenty bag of weed
But little old me with the few facts that I speak
The homeland security gaffeled me over seas
Froze my bank account and seized my guarantee
And y'all are soundscanning like a hundred more than me
They kicking you off tour for freaking a chick or two
Verizon dissed me too cause I was too political
Y'all are all safe and shit, y'all are not saying shit
You just snap your fingers and dance and make your label rich
Gotta pay back that advance, so they ain't gave you shit
This is your chance to say something and you're wasting it
People are starving, you talking bout balling
Can't think of nothing more important than that jargon
Hundred different ways to describe diamonds sparkling
Eighty percent of kids are listening to y'all shit
I heard that statistic I almost cried
Never wanted so bad for 2pac to be alive
What the fuck happened to rap when
The gangsters are scared of upsetting they industry masters
It ain't my place to say and I hear all that
But fuck that, I live in the hood and we need y'all cats
So as soon as I hear y'al on some real pro black
Then I will gladly go back to my emo rap
They say the truth don't belong to nobody, if you see it you speak it
It would be a sin to keep it a secret
So if I need to breathe then believe that I mean it
Quit trying to be somebody's boss and be a leader
If it wasn't bad enough your labels are hoeing you
You can't even scan, your fans are downloading you
There's no connection, so they're not supporting you
You ain't never shed light on nothing that they're going through
We ain't buying CDs, we striving to live
And these artists don't need me they already rich
I ain't hating on you, rock them shines
Just remember us from time to time when you drop them lines
Rappers can't clap me
Jackers can't gat me

Chorus: 
I stand tall I raise my fists
I pray all this pain might lift
I don't want to die tonight
But I can't live another day like this
Verse One:
The first time I ever broke the law
Was just being born in a zone that's controlled by y'all
A foreigner in my own damn home land
Made me a sixteen year old, grown man
I was aged by the pain that I saw
Outside my front door was the front line of a war
Shots gets fired I cry on the floor
Underneath my bed tryin' to hide from it all
I try to recall the first time that I saw
Someone close to me die and my mind starts to draw
A blank
There's far to many of us die
Genocide it's a genocide
And our enemies will never be satisfied
Until not even our memories survive
It feels like they got the whole world on their side
And the story of my people will never reach your eyes
But understand one damn thing I can't run
I don't care where Goliath got his strength from
I'll rush your tank with not even a hand gun
Only a rock from the land that I stand on
Chorus 
Verse Two:
That's the law that I break when I breathe
The blood of my people races through me
I will never back down, I can not flee
Would rather die on my feet then to live on my knees
Adorning the soldier uniform I was born in
I did not chose the war I was drawn in
If I been called to be a martyrs end
I'm standing on Heaven's front door with a grin
Saying please let me in
Greet me as a friend
I did not believe I would breathe free again
Lord have mercy on my soul
I was desperate and I had people to defend
I'm the slave that drowned on the middle passage
I'm chief Sitting Bull at the hand of a savage
John Brown standing, both guns blasting
Crying freedom, something must happen
If I'm the only weapon that I have
Then I'm standing with a bomb strapped to my abdomen
Eyes full of water
God please forgive me
My people must one day live free

Good Lord,The Truth Is Here EP,2009,"Bismillah Ar-Rahman Ar-Raheem

I said the good Lord made me what I am and I play this game for keeps
Got to use what I have to get what I want, all the dreamer got is his dream
And the good Lord made me what I am and I play the hand I'm dealt
Said sometimes the hardest thing to be in this world is just yourself

Best believe the Qur'an influenced all of my songs
My fans run and tattoo 'em all on they arms
Wanna travel, be there every time I perform
Now look me in my eye and tell me, how am I wrong?
And who would of thought
Just givin 'em the truth from my heart, both the ugly and the beautiful part
Would give 'em food from thought, let 'em chew it apart
And they'd all crowd around me and my movement would start
And how you gonna hate me for being what God made me?
It's not a game, I ain't sayin it playfully
They relate to the joy and the pain in me
And seein me make it be watchin a slave get free
Holler like Bilal in the tower
Hayya alal falah
, 
Allah is the power
Givin voice to the dream and let it be seen
I admit it's obscene but deen recognize deen
So it isn't pristine when I spit a sixteen
Clean words don't describe the (shit) that I've seen
But layin in the alley, 
I whispered the Shahada
Bullets fly by from the drive by
So Imam Mohammed might pound on the podium
Popmaster Fabel work it out on the linoleum
Chappelle bust funnies, Mos Def bust rhymes
Muhammad Ali is the greatest of all time


Something spiritual happen when them hands get to clappin
Can you tell me, what language do you laugh in?
The human reaction of smiles and cries
What language are the tears when they're fallin from your eyes?
You've probably seen the sunrise hundreds of times
But let a painter paint it or a poet describe
The very moment where heaven and Earth might collide
And God let the breath of life come outside
Uh, Satan doubted it, angels bowed to it
I'm so beautifully human and I'm proud of it
Soul of a soldier, heart of a scholar
I wrote this poem with the blood of a martyr
Imam Mohammed might pound on the podium
Popmaster Fabel work it out on the linoleum
Chappelle bust funnies, Mos Def bust rhymes
Muhammad Ali is the greatest of all time

A lot of cats
Get up in an age around
In their early 30's
And they start to think of like lifetime companionship
And that's when they start to meet ladies who
Are not too prone to trust anybody
And they got plenty of history to prove to you
Why they shouldn't trust nobody
I didn't know you then, when all that stuff was goin down
Put them other cats away man
And let me try to make somethin in your life",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-good-lord-lyrics
Palm the Joker,The Truth Is Here EP,2007,"Have mercy on me my Lord
I'm just tryin' to walk to the corner store
And the brown and blue armies are always at war
What on Earth they wanna harm me for? I don't know
Have mercy on me my Lord
I'm just tryin' to walk to the corner store
And the brown and blue armies are always at war
What on Earth they wanna harm me for? I don't know

We raise monsters in the basement
Feed 'em shell casings and train 'em to chase us
We rip most the pages out
Of the Bibles and Qur'ans, in this house it's their view we care about
Such as God has forsaken us
And from his anger gush forth plagues and floods
The chosen people done stoned the great prophets
His mighty wrath stay upon us 'til the day of judgment
We spend days punchin brick walls
The scabs we rip 'em off and fill them bitches with salt
To all injury we add insult
Got a leather bound edition of shit that ain't our fault
Swabbin' down the bridges with lighter fluid
Too timid to burn 'em, we pray the lightning do it
I wear this mask 'til my face grow to fit it
Frozen in a paradigm, waitin' out my sentence
Livin' in a well (Well), self made Hell (Hell)
Medicated, dwellin' in a pit within myself
I waste time patiently, suffering the pain
And kindly invite you to Hell for not saving me
I see a poor victim's face
Reflected on the pawn shop glass pistol case
The breath make it foggy and then it gets clear
Now which metal here would fit best in the ear?

Have mercy on me my Lord
I'm just tryin' to walk to the corner store
And the brown and blue armies are always at war
What on Earth they wanna harm me for? I don't know
Have mercy on me my Lord
I'm just tryin' to walk to the corner store
And the brown and blue armies are always at war
What on Earth they wanna harm me for? I don't know

Talkin’ My Shit,The Truth Is Here EP,2007,"* originally a B-side to ""Uncle Sam God Damn"" 12"" (the blue version)
Intro Sample:
Shit, motherfucker you talkin' to the kid
Talking (Brother Ali):
Yeah. Ladies and gentlemen. Boys and girls
The one and only Brother Ali is in the house tonight
That's me. We gettin' directly into this right here
Verse One:
Hold up
Do you mind? I'm trying to build a kingdom here
Walk to the store with your boy let's get a ginger beer
Listen here I got some shit to sprinkle in your ear
Rip and tear the kick and snare, whistle like Rakim was near
Independent penmanship, sending bitch-tendency-havin'-rich-rappers to their residences
My present tense is legendary livin'
Like my fifty grand merch, work for what I'm givin'
Build and add to it with the skill I mastered it
Carefully grabbin' shit to build a castle with
Ended up champion of underground rappin'
It ain't what I imagined but I still ain't mad at it
I'm in a college town bossin' that crowd around
Raise your hands, wave em up, do it like this and holler out
Like a Gladiator movie score
Try to teach a cracker rapper how to clap on two and four
In the crowd I'm shakin' peoples hands
Just to take an equal stance with my barely legal fans
Can't believe they ass came and heard him raw
Made em want to run and hug him with a sweaty shirt and all
Labels turn me off, I ain't what they lookin' for
I ain't got a six pack, tatoo or a bullet hole
But I'm muscle underneath all that
You get your peanut smacked
I scrap like I'm Butterbean on crack
How he manage not to catch heat flashes?
On stage Adidas jacket doin' Heavy D dances
These rappers are graffiti on canvas
Even if they snappin' they could only be half of it
Chorus:
I say shit motherfucker shit
Ali and them sitting on another hit
He got his fist up to the government
Still tryin' to get his dick sucked, son of a bitch
So let me talk my shit
C'mon now, let me talk my shit
Calm down, let me talk my shit
Verse Two:
Let me start off my shit like this
Quiet down now the masters rappin'
And Ant got his back trying to craft a classic
Joe Mabbott track, they have to grab it
Like my dick when they...naw, I ain't sayin' that shit
We all thought some weak lines by now
But you actually rewind and write yours down
And walked your behind in the studio to speak it
And then decide to keep it and release it
So either you believe it
Or you don't give three shits about havin' lyrics, you can take it or leave it
So if you're not really thinkin' about the things that you say
Then don't call me a hater when I feel the same way
Came up in the day, listening to the greats
Learned to smell a fake half a continent away
I ain't dumbin' down you're gonna have to smarten up
Too tough, your blade ain't sharp enough to cut
Bout to fuck em up
Someone should have ran and told him that I'm nuts
Buttercup ain't tryin' to knuckle up
Sock 'em in the eye, baby, slug 'em in the gut
Should have never let the Brother run amok
What the fuck!
Chorus
Verse Three:
Big bad, fat ass
Cat that can rap fast
Straight up nasty like a New Orleans lap dance
Last chance to pass on the chitterlings
But act now and we can still split a thing of chicken wings
Fredo Corleone, bitch kiss the pinky ring
Backpack raps answer to Sam Kinison
Is in your town
Act like your shit isn't brown
Your highness probably piss sitting down
These Eddie Brock MCs is so venomous
Can't seem to picture the authenticness
Trying to keep up is bad for your health
It's a walk in the park, I'm photographing myself

Hey little honey bee. Haha. You look like you were looking at me
I was standing over here. Naw. You wasn't looking at me?
Well what were you looking at then? I know that you weren't looking at nobody around me
Yeah, come over here. Lean a little bit closer
Let me tell you something in your ear
Chorus: 
Baby don't go I know you're listening
But you gotta try to play your position
Fallin' in love and you won't admit it
We're only livin' come on and risk it
Verse One:
Baby girl I ain't easy on the eyes like the rest of them boys
And I don't spend a months pay check on my clothes
But when you in the bed with the pillow under head
Who you really want to get up and check on that noise?
Got a permanent feather in my cap
Got a strut in my stride, a stroll to my step
Realizing that it's all about the mindset
Get a little closer the older I get
Wear a ticklish grin on my chin
The good Lord put me in this particular skin
When he speakin' to the angels, I be listening then
And I share an inside joke with all of them
I'm high without smoke
Shine without a rope
I am the old, step out fly when I am broke
They always crowded around me when I spoke
Because every time I start rhymin' it's a quote
Leave it to me to see the diamonds in your coal
Holler at the glow from the bottom of my soul
Ain't no need to polish it no more
Baby let your guard down and let your heart go
Girl
Chorus 
Bridge:
C'mon and just throw your knees in the air for me baby
Tremblin' like you just might care for me baby
Say hell yeah
Good till you say hell yeah
(Brother Ali Talking):
I'm saying. I came all the way over here
I done laid myself out. The least you can do is dance with me. C'mon
Verse Two:
If I ask you to dance then we gonna actually dance
I don't just rub my pecker on the back of your pants
If you're down to take a chance then let me lead you by the hand
You an expert on boys, let me teach about a man
They stand close to me
They want a dose of me
If you witness me how come you don't love me?
I had to look this way because I'm so stunning
I spear blind you until you don't see no ugly
Party starter, show stopper, real, no drama
Born alone, die alone never had a coauthor
Don't no joker throw down no harder
Light the roof on fire we don't need no water
We gonna sit on a wish and let our feet dangle
Let the song with no chorus be the lead single
Damn how the world do it, the world is wrong
She knew I was right the moment she heard this song
Chorus 
Bridge:
Just throw your knee in the air for me baby
Tremblin' like you might just care for me baby
Say hell yeah
Good till you say hell yeah",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-baby-dont-go-lyrics

Don't worry about it, get down with me and ah
We'll set you free ...""
(Hit it!)

Yeah, yeah
Gone in a swing like that right there
Yeah, ah
(I want everybody to jump out their seats
And start clappin your hands)

Rhymesayer Entertain, try to name a better team
Reveal your jealous aim, some things'll never change
Best twang your family together mayne
Them people cellophane, allowin their mother name
I'm invincible, walk with my word and my balls and my principles
Like a true prince should do
Only givin you a little bitty glimpse of truth
As I live it through, imagine what I'm fittin to do
I ain't that hit it and quit it dude
Live it for that minute, then split and I'm here to get residual
Pedal hard and settle not for even a notch
Between the premium spot, cream of the crop
Believe it or not, I'm over every line like one
Life changin moment at a time
Please trust you'll find, no better design
I'm so justified, I'm boast of epic kind
Nose to the grind stone, wait, no never mind
I could tell you 'til I'm blue in the face, the end of time
If you was ever gon' bear witness to the child
Then your ass probably would've been admitted by now

So now, ah, come now walk with me
I think and I walk and I talk awkwardly
If when you gotta see in order to believe
Then your ass must be blind, none strong as me, Ali
Ah, come now walk with me
I think and I walk and I talk honestly
I show strangers what they ought not to see
But that's just our nature, none strong as we, ha

Call me Slug, that's it, don't need no acronyms
Tryin to keep the masochist tucked inside the pacificist
But God it's gettin hard to give 'em passes when
They act as if they came up on the south side of Nazareth
Can't imagine this, it's like a beauty pageant
Where them models project and serve the law of averageness
Coat hanger on the mic, rappin mannequins
Stash 'em out behind the garage, where the trash be in
Don't go and get mad, I ain't your daddy kid
And you not Ant, so why you tryin to sample this?
So pop your little titties out, ego expandin
Them shenanigans'll catch a free ride up in that ambulance
Can't fix them damages with bandages
Another midlife crisis, tryin to brag on all the ass you get
Cash it in and take a look at who you dancin with
You just a middle man between the fiends and your management
Minneapolis, takes the passion with
A twist of lemon, cause I'm on some old fashioned shit
So tell Anakin we lookin for Orlando with
Coach and the ""Champion"", go fix a couple sandwiches

Yeah, come now walk with me
I think and I walk and I talk awkwardly
If when you gotta see in order to believe
Then your ass must be blind, none strong as me, Ali
Ah, come now walk with me
I think and I walk and I talk honestly
I show strangers what they ought not to see
But that's just my nature, none strong as we, come on

Used to raise babies in a funky old dirty place
So I kept me a snub nosed .38
Took it to the pawn shop on the first and paid
Rent with it, didn't want to send 'em to the pearly gates
In the clutch of the beat drop
See me hop up off the Sheetrock and strut like a peacock
Get your teeth knocked, clean out your speech box
Must not believe that meets the grease part
I wrote God a love letter with street chalk
Fell through potato chips, could of put beach hut
And there I stood in all of my splendor
'Til I did believe I told 'em everything that I meant to

Come down now, come now walk with me
I think and I walk and I talk awkwardly
If when you gotta see in order to believe
Then your ass must be blind, none strong as me, Ali
Ah, come down walk with me
I think and I walk and I talk honestly
I show strangers what they ought not to see
But that's just our nature, none strong as we, ah

Tell your stories through me and feel free
If yall tryna talk bout the horroes you seen
Tell your stories through me
Trapped and locked in the belly of the beast
Just like Malcom, Martin
Solomon, and Jesus the last great prophet
May never get released
Over a penny any beef
Cats will stab you in your sleep
Plus they have to keep look out for their captin when they creep
They're masters of deption and they tragic with they deeds
Its madness that you speak of innocence and guilt
In a prison that was built just to generate some wealth
Facilities, they building industries withing themselves,they out earn two thirds of anything they sell
The gavel and the 13th amendment give them hell
When they filling the demand of men and women in themselves
System stay in business cause the children that they fail
Gettin ill when they drillin out a living for themselves
Hopeless they send them in as their feeling prevails
They stealing killing slinging steady feeling up them jails

Begin Here,The Truth Is Here EP,2009,"Brothers and sisters I know we had a good time this evening
If we can get your attention, at the stage for just a minute, please
Want thank y'all ever so kindly for coming out and joining us yet again
You know me and Anthony sure do appreciate it
We want to thank, his majesty, I Self Divine, for, blessing us
With his presence here this evening
Yeah, you know my big brother Slug, he got on the mic tonight but
If you listen real close he's there in everything we ever did
In the background smoking, you know, being cool
Ant break this down for me
Just going give you a few more words before we, before we get on outta here
(*clears throat*)
When I was young you couldn't tear me away from the stereo
And used to carry one with me everywhere I go
As I memorized the words I genuinely believed every line I heard
I thought that these men that I referred to
Was prophets of our time would never lie in verse
I can't begin to tell you how it hurt
As time went on some of them disguises burst
I always said if ever I get heard, if ever I am perched in an elevated place
High enough so this world can recognize my words
I would never turn and try to hide my face
And so I give it all as an author
Even if myself is all I have to offer
I don't exaggerate it, I would gladly be hated for what I am
And just stand and state it
And if you relate then you can take it
All human beings are the same when we're naked
We all living through the same insane trip
But we ain't it in alone if somebody stand up and say..

A lot of people waiting for their big break to make it
You going spend your all life waiting until you learn that
Anything given to a man can be taken
Only thing that's ever really yours is what you earn
It's a mistake to label it patience when you see a person
Latently waiting for a turn
Another one got the faith to go and take his
Win, lose, or draw the end ain't the concern
I want it so bad I can taste it
And makeshift tools are the only ones to work
In the hands of a dreamer to make it take shape with
See if I can't get this old torch to burn
And all of those chains and the bracelets are symbols of that
For which our souls yearn
Strip it all away and what you face is we're trying to touch happy
Before we touch the earn
I thank you from the bottom of my heart
Every show you ever saw, every album that you bought
You can be my guest and tear it all apart
At the foundation you'll be sitting there with what I fought
The past is gone, my path is charted
My grasp is strong, I'm just getting started
My aim is steady and my view is clear
My name became heavy and the truth is here...",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-begin-here-lyrics

I start waking up in my bed, not knowing where I'm at man
The bad part is, I look over at my wife
And like I don't know who this person is in my bed
(Tell me is it real?)
I'm bugging out (yeah!)

If I wake up in a hotel room or on the bunk of a bus
Middle of nowhere, shit I'm completely fine
But let me wake up in my crib, I get to flipping my wig
Anywhere as long as it isn't mine
I've been on the road seven out the past eight months
Want to live, you got to give your loving fans what they want
So, if they want ""The Truth"", you got to tell 'em it's here
Ask Randy Hawkins man, I had a hell of a year
My first headlining tour, my album in stores
And I finally got to see what all that grinding been for
To get down for the cause and catch a round of applause
And to see the shit I spit get printed out in The Source
My heroes brought me on tour, 
I said Allahu Akbar
Thank you God, I don't know what else I could bother you for
Got me out in California at this Wal-Mart store
With the Lord Rakim, we chilling, shopping for drawers
I blew my little video budget, I figured ""fuck it!""
You only live once, you best to entertain your public
I did freeze my nuts in D.C. on a Handycam
On the White House lawn (hey!) rapping +Uncle Sam Goddamn+
Shook hands with Busy Bee, I said his line from ""Wild Style""
""The Bee part be"" and he smiled
Saw him out in the Bay with Fred Hampton, Jr
Somebody made away with my God damn computer
I caught a flight home on my 30th birthday
A gift courtesy of my main man Mercy
Needed to see my wife and Faheem in the worst way
Ended up having both a blessed and a cursed day
As I walked onstage to give 'em these raps
My DJ's wife was on that bridge that collapsed
She ended up breaking her back and getting roughed up
But she already walking, you bad motherfucker
As real as can be, I keep my people with me
And that's BK, Drinkala and King Toki
Rhymesayers Entertainment and what more can I say
Except I got a brand new baby daughter on the way
(Tell me is it real?) ...

Uncle Sam Goddamn,The Undisputed Truth,2007,"Ah, the name of this song is Uncle Sam Goddamn
It's a show tune, but the show ain't been written for it yet
We're gonna see if Tony Jerome and the band can maybe work this shit out for me
And straighten me out right quick
I like it so far man
Yeah
Come on, lets go
Welcome to the United Snakes
Land of the thief, home of the slave
Grand imperial guard where the dollar is sacred and power is God
Lets do this shit for real, come on now

Smoke and mirrors, stripes and stars
Stolen for the cross in the name of God
Bloodshed, genocide, rape and fraud
Writ into the pages of the law good lord
The Cold Continent latch key child
Ran away one day and started acting foul
King of 
where the wild things are
 
daddy's proud
Because the Roman Empire done passed it down
Imported and tortured a work force
And never healed the wounds or shook the curse off
Now the grown up Goliath nation
Holding open auditions for the part of David, can you feel it?
Nothing can save you; you question the reign
You get rushed in and chained up
Fist raised but I must be insane
Because I can't figure a single goddamn way to change it

Welcome to the United Snakes
Land of the thief, home of the slave
The grand imperial guard
 
where the dollar is sacred, and power is God
Welcome to the United Snakes
Land of the thief, home of the slave
The grand imperial guard
 
where the dollar is sacred, and power is God

All must bow to the fat and lazy
The fuck you, obey me, and why do they hate me? (Who me?)
Only two generations away
From the world's most despicable slavery trade
Pioneered so many ways to degrade a human being
That it can't be changed to this day
Legacy so ingrained in the way that we think;
We no longer need chains to be slaves
Lord it's a shameful display
The overseers even got raped along the way
Because the children can't escape from the pain
And they're born with poisonous hatred in their veins
Try and separate a man from his soul
You only strengthen him, and lose your own
But shoot that fucker if he walk near the throne
Remind him that this is my home, now I'm gone

Welcome to the United Snakes
Land of the thief, home of the slave
The grand imperial guard
 
where the dollar is sacred, and power is God
Welcome to the United Snakes
Land of the thief, home of the slave
The grand imperial guard
 
where the dollar is sacred, and power is God

Hold up, give me one right here
Hold on
You don't give money to the bums
On a corner with a sign bleeding from their gums
Talking about you don't support a crackhead?
What you think happens to the money from your taxes?

Shit the Government's an addict
With a billion dollar a week kill brown people habit
And even if you ain't on the front line
When massah yell crunch time, you right back at it
Plain look at how you hustling backwards
At the end of the year, add up what they subtracted
Three outta twelve months your salary pays for that madness
Man, that's sadness
What's left? get a big ass plasma
To see where they made Dan Rather point the damn camera
Only approved questions get answered
Now stand your ass up for that national anthem

Welcome to the United Snakes
Land of the thief, home of the slave
The grand imperial guard
 
where the dollar is sacred, and power is God
Welcome to the United Snakes
Land of the thief, home of the slave
The grand imperial guard
 
where the dollar is sacred, and power is God

Walking Away,The Undisputed Truth,2007,"Go ahead and wager that you never listen to another song of mine
I can't say I blame you either
Cause if you made records you ain't gonna catch me listening to that shit
But if you do I just want you to know, I didn't make this to hurt you
God knows, you done hurt enough
Just... I don't know, try to make some real shit, you know

Bye, you ain't never gonna see me again
If I can help it, little fellow take it easy
Fresh out of forced tears, kisses and hugs
You about to lose the company your misery loves
Ain't never did nothing but try to kill your disease
At least help the symptoms, instead you infected me
I'm not the kind of man to draw a line in the sand
If you gotta draw at all then it's time for you to scram
P.S., you can keep all this shit
And hang around your broke friends and call yourself rich
The struggling I did with you was all for nothin'
It was never enough, your heart set on suffering
I admit that I was weak in the beginnin'
I wanted someone to need me instead of a friendship
I didn't think I deserved a true partner
So I transferred the arrangement I had with my mama

Since you never listen to a word I ever said
Maybe seeing this door slam, will get it through your head
I don't love you, I don't think I ever did
And if you hadn't tried to kill me, I'd stayed for the kid
 X 2
There's nothin'more for us to say
Got my mind made up, I'm walking away
Sometimes we just outgrow the role that we play
Hope you find a happy ending to you story someday

Round and round and round we used to go
I never fucked you right or made enough bread, I know
If I'm such a bastard, and mistreated you so
Then how is it you're losing your mind to see me go?
Truth be told, I held you together
For all them years, and I cheated on you never
Defended your honor, took in your mama
When she tried to rehab and had you back through the drama
You got a sick stone under your ribs
Where a heart is suppose to live
Sick, twisted and vindictive, with your windows dim
Baby, you're not wicked hard bull fish, you must shiver
How you threaten to kill the most precious
Gift that you'll ever be blessed with?
Unless you're twisted, demented and depressed and shit
And alone cause you faithfully slayed your friendships

Take Me Home,The Undisputed Truth,2007,"And I promise if you take me home
I'll sing you a song, never leave me alone
Said c'mon baby throw me a bone
I'll sing you a song, never leave me alone
And I promise if you take me home
I'll sing you a song, never leave me alone
Said c'mon baby throw me a bone
I'll sing you a song, never leave you alone

I'mma tell you something about me
That's my favourite subject, I don't know whether you picked up on that yet or not

I never said I had a business mind
I just don't believe that quitting time exists, ain't no finish line to this
You got to give me mine, I really shine, my given time is this
Live and die by the grind driven by the fist
Where do you place my name if I never played your game
We don't race the same, I don't run inside no painted lane
Plus y'all pacin' strange, y'all either stop or you sprint
Run when it's sunny and hide if it change to rain
I wouldn't be half the Ali that I am
If I slowed myself up and tried competing with these people fam
I'm every bit as unconcerned as they are unprepared
Market flooded, needless to say I wasn't scared
Let's all drop they same day, I don't fuckin' care
Put listening stations in the store and let the public hear
Better yet, let's have an in-store performance
Make it oranges to oranges, me dwarfing your endurance
After that we'll shoot the shit with our supporters
And see how many more discs of yours the indie stores order
Shit you already knew I out rap em'
On the low we out work, out think, and out class em'


Nobody's doing this thing exactly like we do
They do it, they just ain't doing it like us, you know what I'm sayin'
Sucker ass mother fuckers

My personal pedigree's so bona fide
Cause a man of my stature ain't born overnight
The undisputed king of where poor folks reside
Because every time I speak it be hope vocalized
And you sit and bitch with your chickens about it isn't fair
The sound system ain't shit but I was crystal clear
We first name basis, sound men - we give em' beer
Plus I tipped 'em 50 last semester when the clique was here
Listen here, I ain't gonna give you all my secrets
Just these few examples help me illustrate my pretense
Our strength is unrelated to your weakness
Cause you'll never be a worthy pool of peers to be competed with
I see my shit with Son House and Syl Johnson
And always loose, I done lost face too but I'm sporting their shoes
So let me remind you, them little kicks you trying to fit
We outgrew them shits in high school man

I don't think I'm arrogant man, I think I just
You know, I do's what the fuck I does man if that's just..
Kiss my ass for all I care

It's of foremost importance there is none like unto the brother
Out this motherfucker regardless
So stop all the nonsense
You see me lounging: call Rhymesayers' office
I've officially lost it
They say my reputation precedes me
I don't know the meaning of off-season, I ain't taking it easy
Ain't taking a day off, never had an off-night
Never been laid off, I live on the job site
It all pays off though when I squint in the spotlight
And see your lips are moving to the true shit that I write
And we gon' be alright, every night of my life
It's my night cause I view the future like it's hindsight
I ain't waiting, I'm patiently persevering
I see greatness in the person in the mirror very clearly
And that's why I take this seriously
Baby come near to me and truly, truly hear me",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-take-me-home-lyrics
Freedom Ain’t Free,The Undisputed Truth,2007,"Ain't nowhere to run to
There ain't nothing here for free

If I don't like my life I gut it and rebuild it
Fuck it keep nothing but God and my children
I kill the devil wherever he resides
Even if he hiding in me he got to die
I killed little Jason he was only fifteen
Sewed his good traits together made Ali
Filled his lungs with the Qur'an until he breathed
Let him walk but kept him on a short leash
Here he stand now seventeen year old man child
Ain't asked nobody for a mother fuckin hand out
He trying to carry heaven on his back
Jumped the broom with a stranger ain't never look back
What he know about how the world spin?
Bless his heart he a virgin never even had a girlfriend
Want to be a man so bad that he can taste it
His family fell apart and he trying to replace it
You'll find in him a heart that's second to none
But I know also that his lessons ain't done so
I stand willing to kill him again
If to grow he got to shed his skin then let it be done

Ain't no where to run to
There ain't nothing here for free
See what I see and know that freedom ain't free lord
Ain't no where to run to
There ain't nothing here for free
You'll see what I see and know that freedom ain't free

One half of all the two legged's on the scene
Are too timid to dream cos failure is far too depressing it would seem
So they take whats given
Thats your decison I just don't consider that living
If I'm to die whether or not I try
I might as well let the dice fly
I'm hot knife through butter in the night's sky
It shouldn't take a genius to see this hunger in my eye
So I use blood and sweat to butter my bread
Cos this cold world couldn't give a fuck if I'm fed
I ain't curled up in my bed
If I don't set the world ablaze trust it ain't cos of nothing I did
Listen I dont think God's obligated to touch you
If your ass would rather live in shit than work a shovel
I refuse to let the sun set on me again
Til' the end I'm a one man army, friend
 {x2}
Ain't no where to run to
There ain't nothing here for free
See what I see and know that freedom ain't free lord
Ain't no where to run to

Letter From the Government,The Undisputed Truth,2007," {x2}
I got a letter from the government the other day
I opened and read it and burned that man
The way that I live don't concern that man
We gon' have to settle this another way

When the knuckles turn white and the eyes begin bulging
I take an honest look at my life, it's insulting
And I been sulking about it all week
Hearing the dull screech of metal grinding the concrete
And sparks dance where the worst of both worlds clash
Meaning the blue tyrants and my broke ass
I understand this is pawn take pawn shit
But I'll be damned if you shoot me on my lawn bitch
Think twice before shining that light
In my drawers in the alley in the middle of the night
Garbage bag and house shoes, put two and two together
I ain't no drug smuggler, I'm a struggling brother
I have this dream where I go nuts
Dial 911 from the roof and post up
Decorate your hard head when you came in the cruiser
And paint rod red in the name of Abdullah
 {x2}

What kind of sucker would I have to be after these years
Of you harassing and attacking me to run and join your cavalry
Imagine me all GI Joe'd up in Afghanistan somewhere prepared to go nuts
You clinically crazy if you think you could pay me
A figure that could make me slay these innocent babies
I identify with a slave wishing to break free
He was victimised by the same system that raped me
Look at us poor just trying to get our foot in the door
And unfortunatley hooked in this war
We were both coerced to get enlisted
But his was with a trigger, mine was living conditions
We're one in the same but in the name of some freedom
I'm supposed to put one in his brain like something will change
What freedom? I ain't dying for no president
Sending kids to die when we didn't even elect the bitch
 {x2}

Listen I'm in no position to judge a young stud
Tryn'a use the military to come the fuck up
Cos self preservation is the first law of nature
Play your cards smart, remember what the fucks up
It's really no different from crack pedaling when it
Comes to dying and killing for a dream you were given
Last thing in your mind is how you seen by the system
N' be willing to go to those extremes for your vision
Shit I'm no smarter, I'm fucking retarded
I just know enough to not eat directly where the dog shits
If Uncle Sam wants to threaten my health
Tell him he have to come and get me himself
...the motherfucker

God damn it I'm back to demand we get more
We want more
I want more and more and more
I want more
We need more

God damn it I'm back to demand we get more

I want more and more and more

I stand here naked as the day I was born
Face to the dawn and my faith in the song
Blood soaking the pages I painted em' on
And none of ya'll will take my place when I'm gone
I'm the pure raw uncut, who the fuck want what
Here to show you sucker ass mutts whats the fucks what
Brother Ali vow solemnly not to die while the music is still inside of me
It's got to be allowed to breathe
Got to let it out enough at least to let the monster flee
I want more than what your offering me
Songs that make me feel like I'm already free
I'm a rebel in my own right
Ya'll don't want to write or think or speak a rhyme standing next to me
When the game need it I'm exactly what it need
Put the soul in the speech, let it go, let it be

Not nearly a single solitary soul
Still put the kind of passion to the mic that I hold
One day it'll have to be pried from my cold dead hand
Until then the big man is gold
Got one lone reason to go on breathing
Climb into the zone of the evening, keep reaching
Just to pull more out the core of the deamon
The people need to see them pure human being
Blood, sweat, love, hate, life, death, joy, pain
Little child running wild stripped to the raw veins
Rabid junkyard dog off the chain, barefoot balls out marching in the rain
Sacred war dance suspended in the moment
We throw the fuck down like our lives depended on it
Jaws of the streets with our heart on our sleeve
Throwing shots at the law which is all I believe
 {X2}

Our songs are supposed to be the voice of our soul
Not bought and sold, not all controlled
Bring a little fire when the world get cold
Let me shed a few tears and to me you went gold
People need more freedom
Children need to hear more truth when ya'll teach em'
Damn I want to hear a plan from the dude preaching
Got new seeds with true needs and who's leading
I truly believe every word I've ever uttered on a drum break
Right or wrong, life go on but it wasn't nothing fake
I demand you start listening to the crowd
If not, we gon' burn this bitch to the ground!

Lookin’ at Me Sideways,The Undisputed Truth,2007,"Now baby you gon' get a crook in your neck looking at me sideways
I play high stakes made crook in a crime wave
Must be something on my face
Yelling out that you're not telling what they spelling on MySpace dot com
Bold type face rhetoric
You gon' clickety click and get your head split
What the hell you look like on a message board
Discussing whether or not the brother is hard core
I ain't got to prove to any of you
That anything I ever said was is the truth but I'm ready to do it
And do it leisurely, Ant give 10 beats a week
So fuck it I'll put the record how it needs to be
I understand I ain't perfect alright
I been a thugged out nerd all my life
Thank God I ain't got to serve dirt or snatch purses at night
I feed people with the verses I write
And I fill them with my personal strife
Had some of y'all concerned for my life
For what I've had the nerve to recite
I cut my grass low, bring the surface to light
Now baby you ain't never heard me I'm tight
And I'm surgical like with this bitch
Jake you know that shit, fuck around and get a closed casket and I'm old fashioned
Trying to figure how we got from Whipper Whip to this silly bullshit
It's just so tragic
But it ain't impossible to solve
I ain't learned jack shit from Dorian at all
Let me hear you abusing the culture I adore
I'll come across the hall and get involved like this here

I'm just here to play my part, and inbetween scenes got to stay on guard
I ain't way out y'all, you just don't get me dog
You gon fuck around and miss me dog, it ain't my fault
And they love the way I talk
Eyes get real wide when I say my thoughts
I ain't way out y'all, you just don't get me dog
You gon fuck around and miss me dog, it ain't my fault

Tabernacle my hand, expand to the size of a big black granite statue
Devide it by the lightning speed that they can move
It ain't an autograph, do that math I'mma smack you
I like to pull up my pants and lean back too
Organic vegetables, mix em with fast food
I'm Howard Stern meets Howard Zinn
How could you not find a pal in him and get attracted too
I take it back for you when possible
If your hear this then I'm confiding in you
Pop call me, ""Ali what's bothering you
Don't you want to tell your friends you and your father are cool""
""NO.""You got more ex's than the Honorable Elijah Muhammed do
But that ain't my problem with you
Truth is you're just an impossible dude
You get hostile with fools when they're honest with you
I could make me a snide little comment or two
But I don't see what that nonsense would prove
I don't give fake props to the dude or walk around in his shoes
I just do what the Qu'ran says to do and respect him
Now I ain't even here to get clandestine
But best believe I'mma get what's destined
Be it an Escalade or a fixed up F10
It's better than this bus, best friend believe that
I ain't got a free minute to lean back
Spider-Man 2 coming out and Faheem need that
Plus I wanna teach him how to read on a Leap Pad
Shining bike, smiling like ""look at me dad!""
That's the shit that I'm in to I defend to the death
That I'm every bit as gangster as them fools
If I wasn't G I wouldn't flow like this
If you were really a G you wouldn't know I exist, you bitch
(I don't understand what they're sayin'
But little did they know they could get a smack for that, man)
So I'd advise you to shut the fuck up
Silly muhfucka

Whatcha’ Got,The Undisputed Truth,2007,"(The first thing I want to say is)

I came in the door nineteen eighty four
Paint on the wall got chased by the law
Once got stole in the face for the flow
Was never given a zone had to create my own
It's plain as the nose on my face that I place to the stone
Had to stake my claim to the throne
Ain't no mistaken the sacred in his tone
Ali the new name by which greatness is known
Ya'll act like emceeing is a new sport
You're too inexperienced, your teeth are too short
Every culture has a right to passage
You wanna bypass it and sell me your practice
One for the lunch money
I dont run from you punch-drunk dummies I invite ya'll to come for me
I set up shop hungry when it wasn't sunny
I'll be here long after ya'll are done humpin'
Talk to me when you've done something
Other than swing back n' forth from hating to nut hugging
Know all criticism isn't constructive
Some need to be destructed your done with
And either you retire to the sidelines
Or imbrace this timeless grind with your eyes wide open
Cause you gonna have to earn them accolades
A-N-T gon take you all back to phase one

Yes Yes ya'll you dont stop
Now come alive A-N-T and give me what you got
Brother Ali rock shock the house we most definitely
We bout to turn shit out ya'll
A yes yes ya'll and you dont dare stop
Well come alive A-N-T and give me what you got
Brother Ali rock shocking the house we most definitely
(The way I feel now I just got to rock)

Ya'll ain't heard nothing I gave you your first lesson
For what you're discussin' over the percussion
You'll never compare to me you a parrot parody
Repeating what you hear fly through the airwaves carelessly
The meaning gets lost in translation
You're a copy of the authors first page
Counterfeit money, only get it in small denominations
You'll never be prominent - face it you're imitation
Equal, saccharin, cheap ass generic aspirin
Fructose corn syrup similac and shit
We used to distribute our music ourselves
Our records shouldn't even be held on the same shelve
Its bad enough they put ya'll with rock the bells
Cliche' the culture we're blessed to be involved in it
Ya'll are sqaundering it don't even think for a minute bout pushing limits
You just see a pond to fish in
And you will get strangled by your lines
Whether your angling or saying ryhmes in due time
Send your dudes back to shoe shines and clipping coupons
Fuck you and fuck the lighter you open your brew on
You slither out from under a rock
And then present yourself for something you not the brother you jock
Tried true hip hop customs forgot
I'm swinging on the first biting mother fucker I spot
Why the fuck not I would love nothing more than to bust your body blood clot
Spot
Three things I got I love'em alot
And do anything to protect them from the vultures that plot
Hover above em' and flock
You mother fuckers better not

Yes Yes ya'll you dont dare stop
Now come alive A-N-T and give me what you got!
Brother Ali rock shock the house
Most definitely we gon turn shit out ya'll
Yes yes ya'll and you dont dare stop
Well come alive A-N-T and give me what you got!

Most definitely we bout turn shit out ya'll

Faheem,The Undisputed Truth,2007,"Faheem Abdul Aziz Ibn Ali Newman
I gave you that name, boy

I will never stop being sorry that your home got broken
Feel like I owe you for the road that I chose
But I believe things happen the way they're supposed to
And you'll always be with me wherever I go
I was right there for your first breath
Used to lay you on my chest when you slept
I fed you, changed you, read to you, bathed you
I ain't tryna' hold that over your head, I'm saying thank you
God put you in my arms for me to teach you
Sometimes I gotta not be popular to reach you
But boy look me in my eye when I speak to you
I tell you these things cos I believe in you
Respect, patience, excellence and truth
Make good choices and always follow through
But above all else know Allah always watch us
And everything we do comes back upon us
Alright, lets talk about your Mummy
I need you to know I used everything inside me
To make you as healthy as you could possibly be
And I just couldn't see a good future for us three
And you gonna have questions as you grow
But there's certain negative things that you don't need to know
And baby boy thats what this is about
We live, learn and figure it out
I just pray you don't remember us sleeping on the floor
Have me cleaning mouse droppings outta your toys
It took alot of hard work for us to get where we at
And young man we ain't quitten at that
Just know that it hurts me to death when I leave and go tourin'
I'm scared that it might make you feel unimportant
But our bonds so strong that the moment I get off
We seem to pick right back up where we left off
I tried to say I do it for you
But in my heart I know thats not entirely true
So if I ever come home and feel it hurt us as friends
Swear to God I'll never tour again
I ain't never met a child quite like you
Words don't suffice for me to describe you
You have a genuine goodness inside you
I watch you and wonder if I was ever like you
It's me and you brother for life
So when you put me in the ground look for me in the clouds
You make me the definition of proud
Taught me what this life is really about

They're your umbrella when the weathers tough
See to it that your head is up
If not just remember this
Just never let your chest and your chin touch in public
Those that stand against us would love this
Man fuck them, something's bugging em'
They feel inadequate or something and that's been dug in em'
So deep they can't stand someone else making shit
Player hatred, same concept created Satan
Play em, no never mind let em play their part
They're here to make us prove we are what we say we are
We say we are the hard hearted
Been discarded from everything we've ever been part of
They just robbed it
Unguarded, tormented and tortured
And got nothing but scars and grey hairs to show for it
Fuck that, every stone that's ever been cast or blow that ever landed
Helped to build that man that's standing before your bitch ass
And back to wreak havoc and never retired, retreated or recanted
I, don't expect you to have stood where I'm standing
Why, respect is the only thing I'm demanding
Try, you and I could build this understanding
You can't honestly shake unless you know where my hand's been brother

This is a piece of my puzzle now
Through the years I found peace in my struggle now
If we were put here to carry a great weight
The very things we hate are here to build those muscles
This is a piece of my puzzle now
Through the years I found peace in my struggle now
(Who's to blame for the state I'm in - Yours truly
I play my cards but somehow I can't win)

Listen I was taught that mistakes made with great intentions
Were never sins but where life lessons begin
Now that I'm 27, single father starting over yet again
I am who I have to forgive
Lost my mumma to cancer, closed a 10 year chapter shortly after
Can't deny that was some shit
Alone in this life would've been at my throat with a knife chop
Were it not for my passion to live
Follow my soul, not that I don't know the penalty
But that's the legacy that I pass to my kids
Heard of shining in the heat of the moment
And won my freedom the moment I realized that's what this...


I can't believe my eyes Lord
I don't know what I'm seeing
I done watched them smash into little pieces everything I've been building
I can't believe my ears Lord
I don't know what I'm hearing
I heard they smash into little pieces everything I've been building

Daylight,The Undisputed Truth,2007,"My friend, give me a minute here
You have no idea how to frame me
""Brother Ali is this, Brother Ali is that""
You ain't been right yet
So ok I'll do it myself
Ant, you got me?

Big Brother the beast I'm showing my teeth
Feel it all in the air it's too potent to breathe
Explosive with the frees, got a heavy one I wrote up my sleeve
I could post up or go for the three
Versatile with it I'm grinding until I get it
Mindless of the defined limits or consequences
I defy critics I ain't scientific
I find my intrinsic vibe and I ride with it
Vocals know nothing other than soul touching
So if they land in yours it's just a home-coming
If they don't go there they might perish
Land on deaf ears but die unembarassed
You don't need to hear my race in the song
You hear the plane that I'm on
Your whole face change when I'm on
Your ears might help you see
Fuck hearing me I need you to feel like me
 {x2}
Daylight
Let the dark side slide right on out you
Don't deny it announce it to the Daylight
Let it get inside of you cause you're not alive
Until you open up your eyes

I never asked my brothers to put that crown on me
Now they want to frown on me, look down on me
Pardon me I don't think I'm hurting anybody
Just because I took shahada but I'm cursing at the party
Ain't showing I'm holy just showing the whole me
Ya'll just pretend to be whatever your role be
Don't get me wrong preist and Rabbi, Imam
But maybe that's why the masses don't respond
Can't sit and nit pick but miss the big shit
Expect us not to see the contradictions
Want us to listen and join your religion
I ain't got a pot to piss in who ya'll kidding
I believe in the Qu'ran and all that's within it
The concepts and all of the prophets that are mentioned
But I talk directly to God so if I'm sinning
Ya'll ain't got nothing to do with me repenting
 {x2}

If I'm an open book this is how I'm supposed to look
I got to show it all and don't be shook
So they ask me if I'm black or white, I'm neither
Race is a made up thing I don't believe in it
My genes tie me to those that despised me
Made a living killing the ones that inspired me
I ain't just talking about singing and dancing
I was taught life and manhood by black men
So I'm a product of that understanding
And a small part of me feels like I am them
Does that make me a liar maybe
But I don't want the white folks that praise me to think they can claim me
Cause you didn't make me
You don't appreciate what I know to be great yet you relate to me
And that frustrates me and what can I say
Cause I know that I benefit from something I hate
But make no mistake our connection ain't fake
It's never too late to clear off the slate
You follow my tape then you know What I'm about
If something comes up then it must come out

""Are you here to confuse me?""

Woman I'll give you the grand tour
There's no reason for you to look closer but you do so I show you
It ain't pretty here now but it will be
One day I promise when the sun rays are honest
I chip away at the tint on the windows
Stain on the glass it's a pain in the ass
I scrape and I scratch 'til my arms grow weary
Meanwhile I warn you not to stand near me
I think I built the fence a little late
The demons were already in now they can't escape
I been toe to toe with most of em' though
As a whole they must parish in order for me to grow
Huddled in the gloomy little cracks that they inhabit
They pass away the day I deactivate my habits
Each one gets buried in the back yard
In tiny little graves marked only by a black scar
Kindly watch your step
The silence isn't finished being awkward yet
Trophies lay in the basement to stay safe
Today's mistakes are in a lighted trophy case though

And I want you to know
I only invited you cos I ain't thought you would show
But I'll be damned if you ain't grab my hand
And presented yourself on the threshhold of the Heartland
 {x2]
""Are you here to confuse me?""
(I don't mean to confuse you)

You'll notice antique swordes adorn the walls
They're really not there for decoration at all
I saved them shits from old relationships
And I swing'em at you later if you stay in the mix
Don't you realise nobody's really been inside here
Since it was last drenched in dried tears
Decorating was a senseless idea cos only the blind lonely prince resides
Here
We dine here on a balanced diet
Ego when it's loud self hatred when it's quiet
Inside the castle this is what the life is
Sign here after you read the fine print
It's not much but all of it's yours
Take great caution if you wanna explore
Watch your head when you opening the doors
And always remember that the choice was yours

It's inspection time let me check your design
Your pedigree don't hold up next to mine
I'm a thouroughbred of the most
Excellent kind

Brother Ali and who's asking
The text book definition of brute passion
The future, the past, a true champion is born
Never made and that's a label
You can't pretend
I think better outside of the box
I rhyme better outside of the booth
There's no hiding the truth, I'm the genuine positive proof
I buck shots
Through the roof set the hostages loose, shoo
One might got to give real a minute
But it will recognise A alike once the beat finish
Bleak grimacing winters led him to seek vengeance
With every bit the mistique of a street menace
Self appointed judge with power vested
To hand down sentances from bus stop
Benches
He's relentless with his it's just in his spirit
You don't want to read
About
It fool you want to feel it
Shit happens but I'm calm in a shit storm
Its just normal, what you think I
Balled up a fist for?
They probably thought I was born yesterday right
Well mother fucker I stayed up all night
Hit me hard like huh

Oh the flow gon' cold cock you
You a born bitch local showboating
Imposter
I'm a known credited stone ghetto philosopher
I think very
Deeply, I aspire to be free
Read through these credentials of mine
I'm exquisite and only get better with time
And not yet in my prime
I age like wine and got a good goddamn head at the end of my spine
Plus 
I live outside of those confines
Meaning my expression is yet to be defined
Ya'll will never try putting ribbons in the sky
You would hit your head on that rooty-poot box you live inside
What you gon' do when the well runs dry
Human beings grown images just get old
So when we get old you gon' be out in the cold
And I'mma still keep chasing what I'm owed

Man no question use to always know that I was crazy
Guess it's safe to say I came a long way baby
Mama throwing dishes at my ex-wife bitching at me
Never did envision daddy could be this happy, shit
To me not broke is rich
Got a two bedroom a new sofa to sit
For the first time ain't go to Good Will or St. Steven's
But IKEA put that boy together last weekend
Out in NY I met a fly Puerto Rican
Dimed out sales girl Victoria's Secret
Took her on a train to Pennsylvaina for a weekend
That's eighteen months ago dog, guess where she been?
Frozen tundra chillin with boy wonder
Done discovered love like a mother fucker
I tried to warn my baby that the winters no joke
She said ""Big dick daddy I'll just get me your coat""

Any orphanage will clothe and feed a kid
But I raise my little man teach him to live
That's why he's 4 years old and can read like he was 6
Behave and recite the Qur'an in Arabic
Eat healthy, knows all the words to Laddy Daddy
Taught him to use the potty without his Mummy
It's three years away I ain't the least bit nervous
I feel like I'mma do it real big in my thirties
Honestly love everybody in my circle
Been with me since the scrimmage and the dress rehearsal
Oh let me tell you that my sweet potato pie
Will curl your toenails and bring tears to your eyes
And all corny bullshit aside
Your boys smiling for real the first time in my life

Yeah, fuck him!
He walk like he just did something great
And can't hold his leg muscles straight
I puts a little something in my step
So these  know they ain't fuckin' with us yet
I never left a customer upset
You ain't huffin' and puffin' in my set
Like it wasn't in the fizz-eck
My people ain't for tustlin' and shit
Listen you hecklin' me in the venue, I will duff you in the nizz-eck
I done raised these phrases since babies
In order to make them tough, I trained them rough
Seldom a sentence ever escape my mouth
Without me kicking it hard in the ass on the way out
I step on the tour manager floor
So that I could holler for y'all 'til my throat got sore
They hand me thirty minutes then I won't stop short
Until you beg for mercy and the whole spot pour
And all the while the feet never touching the ground
 grind his teeth to the thunderous sound
Keep clever, every other line is something profound
Now what about me say I'm fuckin' around?
Sweet Jesus!

Listen up, get loud and clear
Gon' shock and amaze with the sound you hear

We gonna shock the party and do it right

You swear to God you wouldn't boogalu
Now look at you when we cry to throw the book at you
I soak into my blood on Ant beat
Your blood on your sneak from a pulp to the beat, right
Should be preserving your breath
Bring murder and death when I swerve in your set
Ain't heard of us yet but we bang bang boogie
Steer clear and let us do our damn thing lookie
Hear I wanna thank y'all for rookie of the year

Y'all buy tickets and raise my guarantee
And that's another hungry mouth I can feed
Believe you me, sequel to the Shadows and the Champ EP
These muh'fuckers all leanin' tryna see through me
Watch out, tell me what the fuck are you really seeing
You ain't shit, you get your jewelry taken
Right along with your shoes and your laces
That beautiful bracelet
'Cause your company control the way you viewin' the matrix
See I came in the game without a name
Just some displaced anguish and a gift for the language
I give a rat's ass what category I'm placed in
At the end of the day, we all piss in the same wind
Same play pen, just a little different arrangement
And I ain't been artistically caged in
I bring to the table gifted innovation
Plus some morbid more than their imagination
I never know when to say when I'm hated
I debate with a stranger 'til I blatantly break them
I give 'em a facelift with the blade of the bass kick
It's a ways to the payment now barely don't say shit

Can't believe I'm still doing this
I thought my political views might ruin this
I figured you might've moved on to these newer kids
My extra, extended hiatuses
Who would've thought you woulda let me get away with this?
I mean, no one's waiting to see what an aging hater thinks
I kinda wanted to be finished
I didn't wanna pull my heart out, let you see in it
I just wanna grow privately, be free a minute
Plus my soul don't always have peace within it
I tell the truth, but I can see that I'm conceded with it
I make a whole lot of mistakes, please don't be offended
I used to have this recurring nightmare
I'm on stage with the whole city inside here
I start choking and my lungs won't provide air
Then I dropped an album, they reacted to it
Started selling out First Avenue
Now all the bad dreams I have are that you no longer care for dude

I love rappers with the big voices
They put the power in their lyrics so you live for it
And spit it boisterous, the ignorant can't ignore it
I put the preacher's style in my delivery
And I remember vividly somebody tweeted Chuck D
And asked him who the best voices are, and he mentioned me
I did seven shows a week for like five years
And used to scream on that mic to make it sound clearer
Now I'm staring down my most profound fear
Started catching up with my vocal cords
I'm not so sure that I should perform no more
Back of my mind, wonder what you're applauding for?

He asking all these dope questions and did his research
And then I meet the editor and staff
And everybody got their cell phone camera to flash
And a story about how my music helped 'em in the past
I gotta ask y'all an honest question:
I mean, I'm beyond honored by this warm reception
But since you got respect and an obvious connection
And every time you bless us with the tiniest little speck
Of an online mention, our fans all shower you with affection
And just blow up your comment section
Well, what the hell, I mean I ain't complaining
But, how come you don't place us in the hip-hop conversation?

I'm just saying my shit didn't exist until I did it
I'm the one that suffered for the politics that I done spit
I ain't quit, I hit every continent and bodied it
School of Hard Knocks equipped, and I ain't get a scholarship
Bet I had it poppin' since hip-hop was on that power fist
Then y'all got counterfeit, I switched and did the opposite
Now I'm on some outsider shit, ain't that about a bitch?
I ain't never lied about what my skin is, it's obvious
I'm just so obsessed with seeing power for the powerless
I insist
I would never operate on cowardice
Rather chop my wrist than be afraid to take this kind of risk
Every single line I ever spit I put it on my kids
On my green, on my tears
All them shows, all them years
All them flows, all them years
I was chose for this here
Maybe I'm a dreamer, that's exactly what my problem is
When I do dream, believe I see it all too clear
I don't need your money, I just wanted y'all to hear

Y'all know me, Brother Ali
Kill em now do it softly
Heroes, ???
Eyedea and Ability and ???
That's the army
Y'all make a song bout getting hated on, but it ain't about me
Just cause you ain't ahead of your game
Don't be yelling my name on the shit that don't involve me
Don't call me, none of y'all cats want me
You can find me in the lobby
Put my arm around your baby mom
Kissing on her neck like, ""man, this is all me""
So salty, my metaphors two steps ahead of yours
And I'm a step ahead of you
And he get the heads to boo, then I beckon you
That what you better do is let em through
Begging you to write a line to try to find
A better mind mutterin' bone-shutterin'
Utterance is, other than this, it doesn't exist
I'm competitive and never lose
It's hell to anyone who wanna diss Ali
Ain't nobody fucking with my disc jockey
It's all about whether or not you rhyme nice
Don't care about the ice in your wrist watch
Freeze!

People ain't eatin', they say the reason
Resources depleted for the defense
I'm offended by these authentic lies
Should have been retired, let me identify 'em
You never give me quire, my people been inspired
I'm the little fire flickerin' within the rye
Feel it vibrate, shake and wake a sleeping giant
Keep him vibrant and vital, re-energize him
My time's arrivin', my shine is blindin'
???, demonizin'
Guys on the wrong side of right from the stripe
Pray lightning strike twice, ice on their idols
Isis, Osiris, Christ in his lightness
Day of resurrection bring life to the lifeless
Tear the wall down, pull the crown off the tyrant
Rebuild, gentrify the planet for the righteous
He who sacrificed it, for the greater good
Elevate him where they should to the title of ""Your Highness""
Only tried surviving is the pious (pious)
United by the mighty human life ties to bind us
Undefined kindness, mine's from confinement
The sightless got about a blind of the blindest
We read the signs inscribed in the horizon
Bright yellow chopped through the night time, ???

I just switch up and go off the head
I never wrote nothing to nothing like this
Just cause I look like these white kids

In the morning, stumble over the words
Fumble over the words
It's off the head that's what you heard
Big bad Brother Ali
And ain't nobody out here fucking with me
My man Fashawn bouta get his ass on
And you know it's all going down after that jawn
My brother Murs is here, my curse is here
I brought my old verses here
I ain't got a verse for this here
But I got something out of my heart that I can spit and it's clear
I effervesce, so never-the-less
Brother Ali always come and try to impress
Just get respect from the big cats
Like Sway and them, shit's fact

I was raised with the raised fist
Angela Davis, summer '68 Olympics
Train banging your wings against the chain
In the events you became gauge-less
Aim to my existence is to resist
Back never bent below, never relent
Of all lights shown, I'm a glimmerin' glint
Was named after a king, and I'll miss the greatest
Changed the world in the ring with his fists
More so with the gift when it rained from his lips
Bigger than just an individual gift
He had a vision for bringing dignity to the crib
Gold medalist in his Olympic event
Significant respect glistenin' off his neck
US flag waved the globe solid
Wore it everywhere he went just to show what it meant
Leapt off the plane back on the pavement
People hell bent, they would never relent
Celebrate him, but it's hand still clinched
And the problems one piece of metal couldn't fix
Legend is he pitched it in the Ohio river
What good's the requisition if I know I'm a victim
Hell bent I'm sending hell back the curriculum
Last president slash second class citizen
Diligent to fight for the people
19 years old sacrifice his ego
Here we go

Writer’s Block,UnKnown,UnKnown,"I ain't trying to be one of them dudes
That make hundreds of new songs and none of them are good
Some of them are cool but ain't saying nothing new
Running through a verse just for something to do
I wanna be the cat that put the straw on the back
Of the camel and send him to the chiroprac
I wanna write a line that's in your head all day
Songs that make you say you never felt that way
Look I'm trying to give myself goosebumps okay?
Find the truth inside me and put it on display
Many dedicated folks, listen to me close
I open my inner soul and slip it in my quotes
Some flood the blogs, some flood the streets
I don't flood nothing I'm watering the seeds
I walk away from MCs offering me cheese
To author a 16 and drop it on the beat
And it's not like money ain't something that I need
There's a business side and I wanna succeed
Plus I gotta wife and a couple kids to feed
But if I sell my love then whats left for me?

Sometimes I don't write a lot
I know some folks call that writers block
I just call it my process
It comes out when it's ready to I guess
I don't wanna let nobody down so
Here's some new shit you tell me how it sounds
I ain't trying to be difficult or no shit
It just hurts too bad to try to force it

Had a week off and a short tour break
I flew out to Seattle to go and build with Jake
He give me the breaks that the famous dude would take
I'm hyped, imagining the magic we'll create
I love my family, but damn, they distract me
When I'm at home someones always yelling ""daddy!""
Need to get away badly and focus
But its been a couple weeks since I really wrote shit
I'm strugglin'
Up late hummin'
Pace around the hotel the words ain't comin'
Wrote a little something threw it away ""fuck it!""
Have an artist freak out moment start buggin'
Maybe it's a wash, my fire's just lost
I'm probably a fraud that got lucky before
If I let everybody down what's it all for?
Looking at Seattle from the 23rd floor
Crack the window it swung open wide
Nothing between me and the world outside
What if I decide to lean forward and fly
They say that's the way Donny Hathaway died
Such a beautiful life ended in suicide
Maybe trying to write was tearing him up inside
Maybe trying to write was tearing him up inside
I swear that trying to write was tearing me up inside
I bet that I'd regret it, the second that I did it
Wishing that instant that I could continue living
I pushed the window closed said ""man you trippin""
Sat down on the bed and wrote this one

Sometimes I don't write a lot
I know some folks out there call that writers block
I just call it my process
It comes out when it's ready to I guess
I don't wanna let nobody down so

Racks on racks is in my hands, my cash is in advance
I don't just put it all in my raps, it's in my pants or
Tucked under the mattress or in the bank
I ain't telling y'all exactly, I'm more savvy than you think
I walked around with gats and carried a little shank
Cause the world treat me bad and I couldn't afford a shrink

They say necessity's a bitch

I can't relate to a woman who's never been through nothing
High, saddity, privileged and soft
They pretty but they always say something to piss me off
My heart's forever with the underdog
Who got nothing to give except for love accord
You should listen to this when you're occupying
? frontlining
Even if you don't join us in the Ramadan
Starving the one thing we all got in common
That's why I'm not styling on 'em
Righteous dude in a Maybach I'm Stalley on 'em
More like a four-door Honda on 'em
Put my baby mama through college on 'em
Off a type of rhyming they find inspiring
I'm not a boss on a yacht, I'm Basquiat
Before I finish the rhyme, you start rewinding
Cause everything that drops out my mind's a diamond
I'm only rocking the bling that's in my chin
Diamonds and gin, to shining from within
That's some shit the poor people say
Maybe so but it's true for me either way
You can ask your man Hov if I'm blinging
He gotta admit it (Uh, it's just different)
The best verse on a song I ain't even on
It's either now, 4th king, never steer you wrong
Reporting live, A-L-I, your brother

Blah Blah Blah ft. Slug,UnKnown,UnKnown,"(sample)
Get yourself together now because it's hit time
Your known as the hit makers
Breaker breakers, party makers
They'll make your back crack, your liver quiver
For all you cats, we're gonna put more dips in your hips
More cut in your strut, more glide in your stride
If you don't dig that you gotta hole in your soul
If you don't dig this mess, you came to the wrong address
Because singing might be loud and clear

Ayo, the music made 'em jump back
Fuck that, how y'all gonna come tracks, some fat, without lettin Ali touch that?
Nothin' whack leave his lips
You're not serious, I got few equals and no superiors (so here he is)
A seasoned veteran, an ego reckon
I turn it up another notch to keep the people guessin
Y'all ain't fuckin with the ox so put your feeble session
Double teamin for the evening, so you heed the lessons
Sluggo

Here we go
Lookin at me like they know me
Only bout as far as they drunk ass can throw me
Do it, somebody's bound to catch it, no breakage
Never that, we keep it basic like breakfast
So taste it, the vitamins are subtle
So tighten up to Sluggo, even try to decipher the puzzle
But shut up though
(Fuck that, sucka jump back)
I hold the game like Notre Dame, I know your dame
(We call her hunch back), Ali run that

From cats lips to gods ears
We mind yall punk bastards and cross hairs
Applying our thug tactics till y'all scared
Don't stop till your drunk ass hits the back stairs (ohh yeah)

Fuck that, jump back, yo, what's that
Drippin off her nuts, wait, why she got a nut sack?
You fuckin rappers are she-males
From the retail to the e-mail, the feet felt cause you need help
 x 2
Y'all need to watch and observe and then follow
If we open for y'all it's still our show
I hear the same bullshit wherever I go
Like Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah
 (Slug)
(Rappers steppin to)
Ah yeah they get their shits burned
I throw a roll of quarters and cyphers and then I get learned
(Yo I don't care were you represent son, where's your chicks?)
We'll take her out for breakfast if you want to let your lips run

Listen, I know your mission, some type of magician that likes to go fishin
On the mic with air tight precision, the leaders in keeping tradition
When you ain't even keeping the rhythm that the DJ is spinnin
Calm down little camper, I've got the answers
You should fuck exotic dancers
You should grow a pair of tits and some antlers
It doesn't matter, turn it up, what the fuck you think that amp's for?

I write poems, write rhymes, write my name in the snow
And I could use all of that to bend the frame of your ho
And I should but instead I'll just pay the waiter and go
But if I didn't have a wife, yo, your kids'd be albinos
Your respect is like a stick in the grass
Mean mugs and tree hugs, I'll go on about it
I wear my toilet paper so that y'all can kiss my ass
With your tongue out and write a love song about it

Write that shit inside of your book full of funny little scribbles
The love comes in vomit, the money comes in dribbles
The Minnesota missiles, self taught
Communication, mutilation, holding pictures of your sister naked

Ha ha, You to drunk to walk down the stairs
And now you're standing here choking on my pubic hairs
Telling me your name as if you think the brother cares
If you keep bumping your gums we can fucking take it there
 (Brother Ali)
I Make a room full of punk rock stop and do the wop
(Rest those shots from a cop, and ask him who's your pops)
Who's you daddy, Fuck that, Jump back and act happy
(Sing my fucking chorus before I punch you in the face)

Daughter (feat. brother ali),UnKnown,UnKnown,":
When you're out there in the woods
And finally find something you love
Better take what's yours
If I raised her all on my own
If you see her cry, sing a lullaby, yeah
You'll die when you see her fly when she's gone
Yeah
One] :
Suck my dick get a facefull
Why can't Prof be all about the pesos?
I'm so unapologetic
I can give a shit about you chicken's little rhetoric
My girl don't take no shit
Try to put a muzzle on me then I'm burning a bridge
Motherfucker, respect my animal
Push me in a corner and I'll split your cantaloupe
All the haters that don't like my shit
If you really got a problem come and fight me bitch
Never before so many heads been talking
Like they can jump in my shoes and start walking
Everybody wants money where there ain't none
We'll see who's standing when the race done
I don't want to be found, I'm a needle
Privileged enough to be built by the people
That means I only got one boss
I see him every time I look in the crowd
I pledge my allegiance to them
This is slop house baby let the story begin:
When you're out there in the woods
And finally find something you love
Better take what's yours
If I raised her all on my own
If you see her cry, sing a lullaby, yeah
You'll die when you see her fly when she's gone
Yeah
Two] :
God God God given
You don't gotten follow my religion to recognize that I'm different
Can't contain it, grab it, tame it, chain, cage or enslave my dedication
No second place in the race to make it
Lace up your shoes for the marathon, chase it
Sweated on stage a decade and came close enough to wipe sweat off the face of greatness
Y'all got low expectations
Hit first place and start celebrating
Chest inflated, saying that you made it, pouring Gatorade on each other's faces
Waste of the space you take
What y'all call 'scraping' is our vacation
I was of the day where always creating
By yours truly, I literally make shift
Dictator haters take dick, but I don't give a fuck so they can't take shit
Prof, let me say and extra Minnesotan
I don't give a fuck ha ha roo roo:
When you're out there in the woods
And finally find something you love
Better take what's yours
If I raised her all on my own
If you see her cry, sing a lullaby, yeah
You'll die when you see her fly when she's gone
Yeah
Three] :
Hush baby, don't say a word
Don't you ever be afraid to surge
I watch you spread your wings and fly no matter how much it hurts
Single father, doubled as a mother
Kept her out of harms way, trouble never touch her
Never had nothing but each other
Whether we strive or suffer or thrive or go hungry
Nurtured and loved her to a full grown woman
Now ducks wanna jump up and try to rush her
Pardon my thug if it make wanna scuffle and make me knock the block off one of y'all motherfuckers
:
Immaculate inception
I made her by myself when I was drunk
She spit, fuck, cuss like a motherfuck
She finally coming into her own
And now you wander up into my home
Talking about you want custody, leave us alone
La Di Da Di, we like to party
You can take her over my dead body:
If I raised her all on my own
If you see her cry, sing a lullaby, yeah

Sweet (Potatoe Pie),UnKnown,UnKnown,":
Hot in the daytime I ain't buying no pumpkin pie
Bake the sweet potato kind, kick it up a notch
No recipe involved it's all memorized
Customized so each one, one of a kind
No disrespect implied but your great grandma recipe she made for Sunday supper time ain't fucking with mine
Yeah I rhyme kind of nice, but my sweet potato pie slice will get me five mics
Nothing out a box or a can
It's all natural, that which grows out the land
Toss 'em in a pan, mix the white with the brown sugar
Got the mixing bowl looking like my children
Hop in and I drown them in the butter sauce
A couple tossed up eggs to make it fluffy soft
Cinnamon, nutmeg, almond, vanilla
If I tell y'all the rest, well then I got to kill ya
Even if I give you a list of the ingredients
Step by step instructions on how to season it
Just how to set your oven when preheating it
Shit just ain't gonna taste the same unless Ali did it
I ain't just putting pie on your table
I'm trying to bring a tear for your eye for your baby
Let you see how I feel inside when you taste it
I love you and I would die for you baby
Them old ladies got it right when they raised me
Told the young man this life get kind of crazy
Taking what they gave me and I made it something beautiful
Old people know that you got to feed your soul
I know the struggle can be crushing, it'll leave you with a hunger for some loving
Make something out of nothing
Come and get some comfort for your stomach
Your Brother pulling something lovely out the oven
:
Alright, real talk, the pie became a problem
Cause I ain't getting taller but I'm steady getting wider
And my blood sugar rising and my heart got to clogging
My guy had to pull me to the side, got to talking 'bout
""You supposed to be eating to live
You shouldn't even keep sweets at your crib
You need to be healthy for your kids
Boy, you don't need to get
Diabetes, you can lose your feet to that shit
Each pie is what? A cup of sugar, half a stick of butter
How many slices of that shit you sticking in your stomach?
I mean, you always been a little fluffy
But keep it up and you gonna be a Chris Farley looking motherfucker
I mean, I hear that you're not smoking or drinking
So you probably use the food that you make when you're escaping
Maybe just take it out of regular rotation
Save it for a special occasion
Truncate it.""

Home Away From Home,UnKnown,2014,"I’m hungry, I done had me hundreds of meals
Lick a shot for every day a spirit turned to the steal
Fuck a pill, you can say my life behind bars
Is hard being and cat trying to rumble with bears
I love it when they hands in the air just like a criminal
Guilty of digging you, wanna post show interview
Wow so many faces in the crowd
I'll be gone till November and it make my mom's smile
New towns I’m proud to look around
Handshakes, laugh loud and they say that we put it down
Virgins to the life, singing verses every night
On purpose, not a circus dawg, serpants and they bite
 a lighter and 'dro sense
I'm gone, coming home, this one is over the fence
Every prayer that I said this year came in handy
Offer me a drink on the road and we family

 {x2}
""Come back home""
My home's away from home all the places I roam
You know we, ""Coming home""
Any stage I'm on, tryna stay in my zone, you know I
""Come back home""

I don't need to pack, I got a bag ready
I mean I've been already steady on the road heavy
So when you offer up your couch and say, ""It's cool bro.""
Hahaha
I might really come through bro
I’m so far from home I gotta sing these songs to keep 
I’m tryna see the people I am working for
Get you asking questions more like, ""What's he angry for?""
They ain't shot boy with gun but he ain't holding one
That sound like murder but the law say...
As long as they got badge on their chest
And you black or you brown...Well, you know the rest
But you should tell your parents, set another plate
Cause in the morning I'll be driving to another state
But as long as they got cops who are assholes
I’mma feel like I'm back home
Lil looks I get it in magazines and blog sites
Now I'm reporting that I'm rocking of a stage right
Inshaa Allah I hope I make it through the night
To wake up and try preserve a Palestinian life


From the moment I was on tour opening for Sean or
Sleeping on the hard floor, tryna make the crowd roar
As I recall it's been a decade now or more
A matter of fact, that’s how long I've known some of y'all for
I knew you when you were 19
Letters you used to write my team from that rehab tryna get clean
The pretty queen that you brought to all the shows
Till one day you took a knee in the front row and proposed
And you knew me when I was cursing at the sky
Hurt person just trying to find a purpose to survive
And you helped me to hit my stride
You put me inside that light
And you knew you had a hand in that
You watched it all with pride
Look at what you did for me
Freedom that you give to me
Let me be the  even when you disagree
I appreciate when you say that I'm underrated
But I like being a secret cause that's the way that God made it
If you're listening then you and I are related
And you know I take this very sacred
Till the day that I die I promise I'll always stay so true
Long as I got you to come home to
You know you",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-home-away-from-home-lyrics
Freedom ain’t free - dirty,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Ain't nowhere to run to
There ain't nothing here for free
I don't like my life I gut it, rebuild it, fuck it
Keep nothing but God and my children
I kill the devil wherever he resides
Even if he hide under me he got to die
I killed little Jason he was only fifteen
Sowed his good traits together, made Ali
Filled his lungs with the Koran until he breathe
Let him walk but kept him on a short leash
Here he stand now seventeen year old man child
Ain't ask nobody for a motherfucking hand out
He trying to carry heaven on his back
Jumped the broom with a stranger, he ain't never look back
What he know about how the world spin?
Bless his heart he a virgin never even had a girlfriend
Want to be a man so bad that he can taste it
His family fell apart and he's tryin' to replace it
You'll find in him a heart that's second to none
But I know old soul that his lessons ain't done so
I stand willing to kill him again
If to grow he got to shed his skin then let it be done
Ain't nowhere to run to
There ain't nothing here for free
See what I see and know that freedom ain't free Lord
Ain't nowhere to run to
There ain't nothing here for free
You'll see what I see and know that freedom ain't free
One half of all the two legged's on the scene are too timid to dream
'Cos failure is far too depressing it would seem
So they take what's given
That's your decision, I just don't consider that living
If I'm to die whether or not I try
I might as well let the dice fly
I'm hot knifed through butter in the nights sky
It shouldn't take a genius to see theres hunger in my eye
So I use blood and sweat to butter my bread
'Cos this cold world couldn't give a fuck if I'm fed
I ain't curled up in my bed
If I don't set the world ablaze trust it ain't 'cos of nothing I did
Listen I don't think God's obligated to touch you
If your ass would rather live in shit then workers shovel
I refuse to let the sun set on me again
'Til the end I'm a one man army, friend
Ain't nowhere to run to
There ain't nothing here for free
See what I see and know that freedom ain't free Lord
Ain't nowhere to run to
There ain't nothing here for free
You'll see what I see and know that freedom ain't free

Room With a View (clean),UnKnown,UnKnown,"(Brother Ali)
I guess its no different from any place else in the world man, I look out my window i see the whole thing
One side of the street, is Malone's Funeral Home and the
Other side's a library, try very hard to picture this shit
Walk through where I live at
Where parents are embarassed to tell you they raise they kids at
You need some half and half or an 8-ball, you can get that
Fuck with Little Rodney and you'll get all of your ribs cracked
In a location where slanging crack rock is not seen as a fuckin' recreation but a vocation
And the sellers, and the smokers are both patient
Got one eye on Minneapolis P.D. they both racin'
3 for 50 is the supply and demand, in the
Twin Cities' American heartland, and they
Been busy, masterminds tearing apart plans
And hoop dreamers ballin' with blisters on they hands
With chains danglin' from the rims
Pain strangles 'em from within
Till' the belt around the arm makes the veins stand at attention
I try to block it out with a bed sheet the moonlight's as a curtain
'Cause I'm not comforted by red and blue lights when I'm hurtin'
Mommy loves you yeah I knew but I wasn't certain
'Cause the lenses through which she views life wasn't workin'
As a boy she told me wait till' your father to come home
I'm 24 still waitin' for my father to come home
And some parents only touch they children when a whips brought
That's why bad kids do bad shit, just so they could caught
And get touched, this growing up shit's rough
That's a big part of why were so mixed up
Shit we don't have Bar Mitzvah's
We become men the first time our father hits us
And we don't open gifts up
Sister Regina from across the street is beautiful
But for 50 bucks ain't nothing she won't do to you
Used to be premium pussy now she used up
For that same 50 bucks she got to do some new stuff
Whatever it takes for you to take the dollars out
If you don't intervene then there's a day she'll turn her daughter out
Speaking of kids I'm fixing lunch for my first born
I had the windows wide open 'cause the weather's warm
That's when the greatest hits of Donnie Hathaway
Got interrupted by a drive-by shooting half a block away
Vaheem was in the window, he didn't get hit though
All praise to Allah
(Chorus)
I see all this from the desk that I write my rhymes from
Pen starts to scribble on it's own my minds numb
But you can call me modern urban Norman Rockwell
I paint a picture of the spot well
I see all this from the desk that I write my rhymes from
Pen starts to scribble on it's own my minds numb
But you can call me modern urban Norman Rockwell
I paint a picture of the spot well
I see all this from the desk that I write my rhymes from
Pen starts to scribble on it's own my minds numb
But you can call me modern urban Norman Rockwell

One For The...,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Intro:
Yeah. C'mon now. The whole planet. Join in. Right now
Ladies and gentlemen boys and girls
This is the way that you rock the world (2x)
Verse One 
Let me tell you 'bout my gangster wit I don't follow no clique
I'm quick to flip a dollar out of 15 cents for rent
I'm a scholar in a blue Impala with dents
Such is life a stand up man that bent
I use this mic and MPC to vent
2000 ways to slay a beat and hint
At what it all means brothers gonna call me dense
When I take my brain and let it touch the rain
And since then I'm a young king in training
And listening to the wind to see what its saying
In glimpses sometimes it all seems senseless
You trapped outside of white picket fences
Still gotta figure out a way how to make it real
In three ways: sports, crack or a record deal
And the homies know how I feel
Till I'm on the next level I'm a grind at will
Chorus: 
One for the money two for the show
Three for the homies who got in the back door
One for the money two for the show
Three for the honies who got in the back door
2nd Verse :
Us rappers we love to tell the stories again and again
About the burning fire that rages within
But all you ever hearing everyday from your friends
Is that if you leave the herd there's no way you can win
So what you gonna think about?
When everything around you is negative including your bank account
Scrapping out a living in a major drought
With no avenue to let your angry out
You rattle your cage and shout
You pray they break you out
You stay truly devout
Cause you wade through doubt so deep
That you can't tune it out
Blood boiling and you ain't cooling out
And that's why I stand on every stage and kick that verse
Like it the first and last time I'll ever say it
I'm nothing if I'm not dedicated
Every win is celebrated for the soldiers that never made it
Trying to figure out where Awesome Dre went
And why Grand Master Cas still ain't been paid yet
So since I'm blessed to run around the nation
I'm obligated to find a new lane and pave it
So if the little homies ever want to disconnect
From the matrix and jump off the slave ships
And when they swim they'll have a destination
And they come right on along and hit the same lick
Its entertainment but its more than that
Why you think Slug took me on the tour in fact?
Why you think El-P put his boys on wax?
And why you think Little Brother's in the door like that?
Its because God gave us something that makes us
More than record breaker we're our own saviors
Ask the average man about taking his life
In his own hands
And he won't understand
That idea was stolen with the land
And we scrape for the few crumbs that fall from the hand
Live life hungry work to get bummy
Or run we they 3, 2, 1 for the money
Chorus: 
One for the money two for the show
Three for the homies who got in the back door
One for the money two for the show
Three for the honies who got in the back door",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-one-for-the-lyrics

Y'all know good and goddamn well
You're fucking with a brother who ain't never had his hand held
And never seemed passed out
Rolling baby strollers over broken floating bottles
In a frozen forest with a dying shred of hope inside you
For this respect, I sweated and bled
And have yet to be discredited by what a critic ever said
""We're unaware of his racial make-up
We know he's an albino but can't science the face up!""
Never question what I am
G-O-D knows if you don't, you can never understand
So you need only know that I'm unrelenting
Nothing breaking, never ending, seldom bending
Cast shadows like light descending
Must not discuss divorce with the case still pending, but
I got some shit to tell you on my next record
For now, we and Sage Francis connected and did--
(*whispers*)
Damage, uh (repeated)

Wrote this one a couple days after Christmas
'Hope' is one struggled game thats persistent
0 plus 1 2, for Self, no assistance
Pistol clear before this new year existed
Somebody get the door
Fuck it, let 'em snore
It's all been said before
Buried in a metaphor
Lucy is hip-hop, and Jacob's a prince
Sean is an old man, and Slug is a PIMP now
They say I'm buggin, cause of the way I love 'em
Nervous, cause I know I'll never make the perfect husband
What, they treat me like LL for art fucks
They hang out and argue about my clown thought and *snort rocks*

I knew love could be a sunrise
Make an old man see the world with young eyes
Round each corner discover he lies
Summertime, the world full of surprise
Every sunset so it start setting in
But you will never see morning again
The flame that you had was now gone in the wind
Start to get old, feel bored with your friend
Your mind start to wander, your eyes start to follow
And wind up on some young behind trying to holler
The dudes that you think are your guys ain't trying to stop you
They grab binoculars, sit back and watch the opra
What she thought was hers you now share with another
And you and something got a secret you keep from her
Make her foolish for ever having trusted
Overcoming your shortcomings cuz she loves you
Such a beautiful dawn and we flow right along, so warm till the sun went down
Can the day rise again? I'd wait, my friend, but I don't know how
Don't want to leave but I don't want my demons to return and haunt this house
The foundation's, The foundation's
Broken
But you know its dead wrong that I ain't never felt so right
The heart and the mind, they don't always coincide
Evil dig a ditch, he cover it with pride
He come to webilize we weave to try and hide
The truth is on a mission to make his way to the light
It knows it has its right to take flight
The universal laws are too strong to fight
One day its going to set up shop in plain sight
Time can ice the pain and try to hide the stain
And glue it back together yet it's never quite the same
Even if she forgives you, she decide to stay
That memory live inside her until her dying day
She goes through the pages of history with a heavy heart
Scratching question marks next to all the precious parts
Your best memories start to develop scars
Would've never thought it'd ever fall apart but
I use to find a hiding place inside you tight embrace
Now all I see in your face are my mistakes
Too much time I done placed around snakes
Saw the apple, had to know how it tastes
I acted out of ego, acted out of lust
Acted outside of the trust we had in us
I acted out a scene from a film I had seen before
Still casted myself in that leading role
When I was finished playing, I stood there saying ""See?""
But there was no director yelling ""Cut"" to keep it clean
The camera kept rolling and went behind the scenes
The bonus material from the DVD
The audience is watching, yelling at the screen
Saying ""Say it isn't so, please tell me it's just a dream""
I use to be the gleam in your eye but that died out
Now I'm that little streak of white in your eyebrow",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-haunted-house-lyrics
World’s An Uproar,UnKnown,2004," {x2}
""The world is in an uproar yeah
Countries all they just talking about is just war
 is falling yeah
I don't think, I don't think that passion is going down anymore""

Have mercy on me my Lord
I'm just trying to walk to the corner store
And the brown and blue armies are always at war
What on Earth they wanna harm me for?
Shit, dog eat dog, wings clipped it's hard for me to soar
Keep falling to the concrete floor
That's nothing, I done swam with sharks before
My heart's seen more than you could possible store
I would never think of starting for the door
Till the stars can't burn no more
And then when I'm gone in my glory and laid to waste
No one's ever going to take my place
Wouldn't cover nothing ugly, just to save face
I don't sugar coat the way shit taste
That's my saving grace
There's nothing I would rather be
Then just good god damn Ali
Believe you me
Peace",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-worlds-an-uproar-lyrics
Freedom Ain’t Free (clean),UnKnown,UnKnown,"(Hook)
Ain't no where to run to
There ain't nothing here for free
(Verse 1)
If I don't like my life I gut it and rebuild it
Fuck it, keep nothing but God and my children
I kill the devil wherever he resides
Even if he hiding in me he got to die
I killed little Jason he was only fifteen
Sewed his good traits together, made Ali
Filled his lungs with the Koran until he breathe
Let him walk but kept him on a short leash
Here he stand now, seventeen year old man-child
Ain't ask nobody for a muh-fuckin' hand out
He trying to carry heaven on his back
Jumped the broom with a stranger, he ain't never look back
What he know about how the world spin?
Bless his heart he a virgin, never even had a girlfriend
Want to be a man so bad that he can taste it
His family fell apart and he's tryin' to replace it
You'll find in him a heart that is second to none
But I know old soul that his lessons ain't done so
I stand willing to kill him again
If to grow he got to shed his skin then let it be done
(Chorus/Hook)
Ain't no where to run to
There ain't nothing here for free
See what I see and know that freedom ain't free lord
Ain't no where to run to
There ain't nothing here for free
You'll see what I see and know that freedom ain't free
(Verse 2)
One half of all the two-leggeds on the scene are too timid to dream
'cause failure is far too depressing it would seem
So they take what's given
That's your decision, I just don't consider that livin'
Shit, if I'mma die whether or not I try
I might as well let the dice fly
I'm hot knife through butter in the night sky
It shouldn't take a genius to see this hunger in my eye
So I use blood and sweat to butter my bread
'cause this cold world couldn't give a fuck if I'm fed
I ain't curled up in my bed
If I don't set the world ablaze trust it ain't 'cause of nothing I did
Listen, I don't think God's obligated to touch you
If your ass would rather live in shit than work a shovel
I refuse to let the sun set on me again
'til the end I'm a one man army, friend
(Chorus/Hook)
Ain't no where to run to
There ain't nothing here for free
See what I see and know that freedom ain't free lord
Ain't no where to run to
There ain't nothing here for free
You'll see what I see and know that freedom ain't free

I stand here naked as the day I was born
Face to the dawn and my faith in the song
Blood soaking the pages I painted em' on
And none of ya'll will take my place when I'm gone
I'm the pure raw uncut, who the fuck want what
Here to show you sucker ass mutts what's the fucks what
Brother Ali vow solemnly not to die while the music is still inside of me
It's got to be allowed to breathe
Got to let it out enough at least to let the monster flee
I want more than what your offering me
Songs that make me feel like I'm already free
I'm a rebel in my own right
Ya'll don't want to write or think or speak a rhyme standing next to me
When the game need it I'm exactly what it need
Put the soul in the speech, let it go, let it be

Still put the kind of passion to the mic that I hold
One day it'll have to be pried from my cold dead hand
Until then the big man is gold
Got one lone reason to go on breathing
Climb into the zone of the evening, keep reaching
Just to pull more out the core of the deamon
The people need to see them pure human being
Blood, sweat, love, hate, life, death, joy, pain
Little child running wild striped to the raw veins
Rugged junkyard dog off the chain, barefoot balls out marching in the rain
Sacred war dance suspended in the moment
We throw the fuck down like our lives depended on it
Jaws of the streets with our heart on our sleeve
Throwing shots at the law which is all I believe

Our songs are supposed to be the voice of our soul
Not bought and sold, not all controlled
Bring a little fire when the world get cold
Let me shed a few tears and to me you went gold
People need more freedom
Children need to hear more truth when ya'll teach em'
Damn I want to hear a plan from the dude preaching
Got new seeds with true needs and who's leading
I truly believe every word I've ever uttered on a drum break
Right or wrong, life go on but it wasn't nothing fake
I demand you start listening to the crowd

Raise Up the Levels,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Chorus (The Grouch):
Raise Up The Levels cause stakes is high
You don't know when till you make a try
If you ain't pushin' then say goodbye
Cause you could die today 
Today, tomorrow 
Give thanks, give praise 
Verse One :
I give thanks CMA think tank
What's the long face for like Lloyd Banks
We rank top notch
We hunger for more
We're finally in stores
Finally off tour
Long enough to cut an album
Bored with the bullshit
Blessed I don't lose sight of how we could lose this
In a blink of an eye
Life is too short to be living that lie
So here's my confession like I'm bout to, I'm bout to...
Try is all I ever did and when
Even when I took a lost I was inchin' in
They could never hold us back I was with my friends
I mean it's all automatic once we grip the pencil
Insult intelligent
Kinfolk irrelevance
Get dissed
Get with the standard of elegance
We raise the bar high above and we hold weight
While they hold on the nuts and stay so fake
Chorus
Verse Two :
Yeah I can arrange that
Give thanks that I ain't bang your brain back
Against your skull doctor cause I can change that
Last few years touring on the same track
Plus did the country with Lucky's stank ass (ha!)
Fire In The Eyes is what I opitamize
Got ride or die in the pit of my soul
And then I'm spiteful but I get it right though
And then you want to criticize bitch give me my doe!
I crawl out of my hole with a lot of my folks
If the whole rap business disintegrated
Keep your eyes on the Rhymesayers guys
And the L's cause we family orintinitated
And I gained your respect and it's not from a chain on my neck
But my chain of events
I offer my joy and my pain and the lens
And remain independent the same as the Legends
Stayed authentic to the same old essence
Learned from the past and obeyed all the lessons
Mastered the craft that came as a blessing
I do not kiss ass for nobody no exceptions
Chorus
Verse Three (The Grouch):
I give thanks for every minute on this planet
I live the length of life, provided I manage
To write my own script
Clone this god damn it
I'm gon dis
I wasn't shown shit but love
Now bring it back to when I was just a scrub
Sleeping on hardwood floors without a rug
Living that Thug Life without being a thug
Waking up hungry, yet guided from above
Despite smug comments I'm on it
My shit stayed honest I promise
I'll never fall the fuck off I want it
I'm gonna get it
That's as good as done did it
Go on hit it
It won't fall
You can't fuck with it at all
You can't go and get it from the mall
I lit it up, smoked it, now pass it around
As long as I live I live passionate now

I bitchslap rappers so hard it give em whiplash
You fuckin with sleeveless t-shirts, where your tricks at?
Look left, look right, wait, where your chick at?
She findin out she walk and talk right, provide dick pipe
I'm a big baller, shot caller, all a y'all are runnin laps
Let me tell you little fuckers a story walkin out
You probably think you're somebody big talkin loud
You're transparent, I been starin through your Karl Kani
Art imitates life imitates art
Get it straight, slice through the mic, pourin out my heart
When it's late night we litter the landscape
Animate our dead opposition to get one last phoney handshake
I read a lot and write a lot, empty my pockets at the giro shop
Hit the cash machine for some green, maybe a ten spot
I said giro cause my Greek's a little broken
But my four-letter French works fine if you're provokin

And we killers in the morning, killers in the evening
Wake up and we yawnin, happy we still breathin
Got one longin, that's to keep eatin
We here to stay and we ain't leavin
(Rock y'all)
(Everything gonna be alright)

I'm a cross between John Gotti and Mahatma Ghandi
Look between pimp and square, you probably find me
There, in vain I solemnly swear
I'm a Guardian Angel with gang signs in the air
I spent too much time fuckin with sorry sobs
Treatin beats like bitches, flippin ménage à trois's
You ain't tryin to see us angry, pop, we already hard
Fuckin the the diplomats'll get you horribly scarred
From the cat behind the wall who play handball in the yard
To the one that run the block as head baller in charge
To the brothers with the kufis on that walk with the gods
Mission Hill, Caprini Green, all ghetto scenery
Every city got us beaten up, down tryin creepin up
Soundbombing people, what? Till we get a equal cut
We come through straight smashin on the haters
Witness the world, the Rhymesayers

(Rock y'all)
(Everything gonna be alright)

Often the brain runs
And expresses itself in words, sometimes profane ones
That's when it first occurred to me where the pain comes
From, page one in my rhyme book
If you listen closely you can picture how my line looks
You presently pressed to be restin next to me
The best of me molestin destiny wrestlin with ecstacy
The recipe for immoratlity
Flows actually be on the malls and factories
Of urban life with the laws of gravity
Audacity, you got a lot of it
Common sense should tell you not to rap against
My obvious dominance
My real lilfe size is bigger than your confidence",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-bitchslap-bonus-beat-lyrics

Brother Ali Freestyle Soundset Weekend,UnKnown,UnKnown,"There's more than one way to tell a lie homie
You can fabricate events that never happened
Or just leave out important parts of the story
There’s a much better chance no one'll catch it
These are lies of omission
A lot of your missions are vanilla rendition of some real shit you witnessed
Tracks you record are only half the story
You're stacking points for the path you forged
You stood watching unknown cats explore this indie rap before they turn the cameras on
Then branded your flag and branded it yours as if as though there wasn’t a map before
But you've been listening that's for sure
A lot of  and similarities they can't ignore
When the interviewer ask for your influences that inform that craft of yours
The actual mold for the mask you wore now you gotta act like you are not a fan no more
You're an imitator at your core
The monkey on your favorite rappers back it matches yours
I wonder when you stand on your big ass stage all of your teenage fans applaud
If somewhere in the back of your brain you're asking yourself just who are they clapping for?
Probably felt like little man at the court
And big cats won't pass you the basketball
Now you grab the door and get a chance to score and put up stats galore and figure damn I'm all
You’re somebody we should be happy for
What’s a monkey to a beetle after all?
I try not to be mad of course
But certain things I just can't endorse",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-brother-ali-freestyle-soundset-weekend-lyrics

Yes y'all the flesh and bone season

Babygirl,Us,2009,"There's big pieces of a life she can't remember
Her mind shuts down, it's trying to protect her
Might be for the best to forget but it seems like
They always reappear when she least expects
Late nights we lay awake, drowning in the lake that pours out of her face
Years late but she's still not safe
Memories leap out ant time, any place
The way he smelled,the way he smiled
The evil she even recognized as a child
Hand on her throat, sting of a fist
Instead of her first kiss she got this
Shameful feeling, painful secret
Lonely knowin' that nobody would believe it
Every wound that escapes her time capsule
Hurts like the day it was born and it's brand new

I wasn't there babygirl but I'm here
I don't know what to say I just hear
If there's one wish I could make true
I would shoulder that pain and take it off you
Don't run babygirl, don't run
You gotta' face what you fighting, head on
Only one thing I could say in truth
You gotta' deal with the demons before they deal with you

How can she find peace in her mind when
Love means returning to the scene of a crime?
I can feel it inside we've reopened wounds every time we intertwine
Such an evil design when you can't even enjoy the sweetness you find
Trying to see through the tears in your eyes and rebuild your shrine one piece at a time
E & K made it all fade away
Colors don't burn no more it's all gray
Can't find heaven from within that shell, but it's enough of a blessing if just not seen hell
Constant inner dialog says just end this roller coaster ride you're on
Only one solution seems final: slide into a hole where your pain can't find you


She said if I was meant to die he would've killed me
There must be a reason that I still breathe
I don't have the tools to rebuild me
But I still believe that one day I could feel free
And my body can be mine again
My eyes can learn how to shine again
My inner child won't have to hide and then
When I'm strong then love could be invited in
Sweet God that's all I ask, of thee
I'm willing to give what you demand of me
I'm learning to embrace the reality
That life doesn't always turn out how it's planned to be
I didn't deserve what was handed me
Only one who can grant happiness is me
What it takes for her to face the day
I can only hope to be half that brave",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-babygirl-lyrics
Tight Rope,Us,2009,"(Verse 1)
Frigid frozen Minnesota
Chip on his shoulder
Sick sleeping on a pissy sofa
Unwanted visitor in a different culture
Missing home and he can't go they're civil warring
Listen solider forget getting over
Prison's sitting 'round the corner, homeless is even closer
Kids with similar skin color still don't wantcha
Spit and insult ya cause they've been here longer
He leave his crib he guaranteed the pigs approach ya
Where ya going where ya from any weapons on ya?
Your family is stressed out you're getting older
You don't live the way they did back in Somalia
Its extra difficult to be a daughter
Trying to keep it modest with sinners all around you
Where the wrong garment your parents get an ulcer
If you wrap it up the other children picking on you

Live in two worlds with your eyes closed
Tip toeing on a tight rope
Holding on for survival
Nobody to blame this is just how it goes
Live in two worlds with your eyes closed
Tip toeing on a tight rope
Holding on for survival
Nobody to blame this is just how it goes
(Verse 2)
Holidays and you know what the business is
You get two birthdays and two Christmases
Older you get you resent how sick it is
They're trying to cover their guilt with the gifts they give
Bounce from his house to her house
Too bad that marriage didn't work out
Now you don't have a your house
Daddy fighting mommy they both tell me they love me
If I get to close to one the other one start acting funny
Ma went and had a baby with a different dad
You act happy to please em but you are really sad
Seeing first hand that family that you will never have
Plus you ain't no real brother, you're just a half
Got to pick up the pieces and move on
Bed time stories and greet them on the phone
Live in two houses and neither one is home
Wishing you were grown have the freedom to get gone

Live in two worlds with your eyes closed
Tip toeing on a tight rope
Holding on for survival
Nobody to blame this is just how it goes
Live in two worlds with your eyes closed
Tip toeing on a tight rope
Holding on for survival
Nobody to blame this is just how it goes
(Verse 3)
Daddy was a preacher, momma was a Sunday school teacher
Big brother, football squad leader
Now far be it for you to disappoint or displease them
Your just being what you feel you see in
That mirror every time you peer in
Swallow the tears inside that empty feeling
A boy terrified to let the world in
He has girlfriends but doesn't want a girlfriend
He retreats inside himself
Where he lives life itself in secret
Daddy says people go to hell for being
What he is and he certainly believes him
Cause there ain't no flame that can blaze enough
To trump being hated for the way you love
And cry yourself to sleep and hate waking up
Its a cold world y'all shame on us

Live in two worlds with your eyes closed
Tip toeing on a tight rope
Holding on for survival
Nobody to blame this is just how it goes
Live in two worlds with your eyes closed
Tip toeing on a tight rope
Holding on for survival
Nobody to blame this is just how it goes",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-tight-rope-lyrics
The Travelers,Us,2009,"Shackles are heavy on the wrist
Stacked like sardines, belly of a ship
Live in your own piss and shit and being seasick
Cracked across your back with a thick leather whip
Salt water burns through your wounds
Women are starving with babies in their wombs
On your hands and knees trying to cry God please
Exhausted, your voice is too weak to speak
Neighbors and strangers are dying beside you
Their decaying bodies you're tied to
Cling tight to your fight for survival
Wonder if your tribe will ever try to find you
Arrive somewhere strange, the air is cold
You can see your breath and you're barely clothed
Your first time ever seeing snow
Sleeping next to it on a hard dirt floor
Go from can't seeing see in the morning to can't see at night
You work till your hands bleed white
Your native language you can't recite
Murdered on sight if you try to read or write
When you bend all of your life and can't see the light
It get's painful to stand upright
Right?
And your eyes bear the sight of your wife
Being being pulled out your shack and brutalized at night
You only taste joy when babies are born
Which becomes an occasion to mourn
Separated, torn from your celebrating arms
Then as quickly as they came they were gone
Sold away from your farm this is all they've known
Never heard stories from home
They forget your name
The culture from which you came
Teaching it'll get you slain
Praying to your God will get you the same
Tortured to near death lest you complain
No choice left, you sing through the pain
And pray that your suffering wasn't in vain
End of your chain, end of your life
Your grandchildren born with no end in sight
So you muster up all of your might
And your last breath comes out (fight)
This is actually true
Now stop and imagine that's you
Now stop imagining unravel the truth and ask just who is it happening to
Everything that the passenger do
The driver experience too
So if humanity is one
Then we all get burned when it's hell that we're traveling through

You've got to save my soul
Put me back together make me whole
Said we don't know which way to go
Take my hand and place me on that road

Trapped in a history we don't understand
Can't remember how this blood got on our hands
Never been taught about the ugly past
Expecting God not to punish man
Our ancestors brought us control
We realize now that the cost was our soul
Got me feeling like an empty shell
Prison guard that inherited a cell
I'm desperate to find my place
Emptiness lies behind my face
Flowers only die in a vase
A heart only dies encased in a lie we call race
I hear the song but I can't sing along
Something's really wrong I can't put my finger on
Terrified to admit it's wrong
Cause I'm hiding in the ruins of a legacy that still lives on
Our identity is hinged upon the miserable myth we've been taught since we're born
Until we mend what was torn
The debt of a sin lingers long after the vicitim's moans
This is actually true
Now stop and imagine that's you
Now stop imagine and unravel the truth
And ask just who is it happening to
Everything that the passenger do the driver experience too
So if humanity is one then we all get burned when it's hell that we're traveling through",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-the-travelers-lyrics
You Say (Puppy Love),Us,2009,"You say I made you fall in love with me
Wish I could make you fall in love with you
You believed in the magic that us could be
And what that you and I means one could do
Every instinct you had said run from me
That this newfound touch is uncomfortable
And to truly stand naked in front of me
Or yourself for that then matter is something new
I take no pride knowing that
You avoid the mirror to shun what you despise
Never knew the beauty you came here with
Till the first time you caught your reflection in my eyes
Never you mind what I see in you
Grow because you're beautiful, not because I need you to
Grow till you outstretch every single piece of you
Heaven will see you through but you got to believe it's true
Go write your story
Even if in the end you might outgrow me
I'll always treasure the chapter that was mine
And twist through time with a smile knowing you're free

Puppy love is real to a puppy
I still want to feel you touch me
I'm not saying leave me, please just be free
I love you so much, I don't want you to need me
Puppy love's real to a puppy
I still want to feel you up under me
Not saying leave me, please just be free
I love you so much, I don't want you to need me

The sky all alone is glorious
We behold it but we can't hold it up
When god says that's it and hits the switch
It'll all come tumbling down when it's bored with us
Sweet you and all your radiance
I can please you, but I can't save you sis
I adore you and might even open up
But even I can't love you enough for both of us
Can't hold you close enough
Can't enter the holes you've boarded up
Close your eyes, concentrate on my voice
Want to make your love for me pure, make it a choice


The sky is there to behold
You just want to be held when you're cold
Just grow, stretch out your soul
And if you still want me I'll watch you grow old",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-you-say-puppy-love-lyrics
Us,Us,2009,"Started rhymin' just to be somebody
To make people notice me at the party
And not be just the new kid that's Albino
Make 'em say
""Yeah I know, but have you heard him rhyme though?""
Now take that same party around the globe
And my story connected with a lot of folks
I hope so cause that's the only thing that I know
I know it so well I tell it with my eyes closed
And I go with the feeling from the start
Blind in the eye, so I see you with my heart
And to me all y'all look exactly the same
Fear, faith, compassion and pain
And try as we may to mask, it remains
Such as your religion or your past or your race
The same color blood just pass through our veins
And tears taste the same when they splash on your face
The World's getting too small to stand in one place
It's like we're roommates just sharing a space
Can't separate and still carry the weight
Gotta heal, get away from the fear and the hate
Gotta shake free from them chains
You see what remains, just a human being end of the day
Don't matter to me what name you gave your spiritual plane
Close your eyes and you'll see what I'm sayin
Uh, I started rhymin just to be somebody
I found out that I already was
Cause can't nobody be free unless we're all free
There's no me and no you, it's just us

I've been called worse and tried to live up

I'm the luckiest son of a bitch that ever lived, I spend life doin shit I love
Got the world's most beautiful kids
 and don't nobody do it like us
Sunday morning play Al Green, make pancakes and watch cartoons
Sometimes get to change that scene, catch a plane and see somewhere new
Plus got married last year, treated so good that it ain't even fair
Already got a boy, now the baby girl's here
, bought us a house like the Berenstain Bears
Not two years ago I was homeless, I mean crashin on the couch of my homies
Now I'm crashin on the couch with Conan, signed a mortgage and bought my home, shit
Should of seen when they handed me the keys, I still couldn't believe that it was mine
Like ""baby hurry up let's leave, before these damn people change their mind""
Ha, and shit what can I say? I would have made these damn songs anyway
Some of y'all still listen to 'em everyday, beautiful thing, I bow my hand and pray

I done did so much cool shit, lived a lifetime in the last two years
Got the memories to prove it, look what a dude who ain't even graduate high school did
Ha, used to always be the new kid, laughed at cause I never used to pull chicks
Now I turn down more girls than them rich ass pretty football playin fools get
Sometimes I smile so wide, I think about the dreams that I've lived

Ha, ha, ha
Hey, hey, heeey
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Ha, ha (another day), ha
Hey, hey, heeey, ah (Lord I just gotta find a way)

Old master had a leper for a child
Left him out to fend for his self in the wild
They laughed at him anytime he went to town
So he kept to his self and he seldom came around
Loved life and he loved his kin
But he couldn't understand why they ain't love him
Slept out in the shed all alone
And all he ever wanted was some friends of his own
The field hands saved him, took him in and raised him
Taught him about love and struggle and patience
Gave him the family comfort he was cravin
He worked when they work and he sang when they sang
He sang so clear and so loud
That the masters of the children could hear him from the house
They recognized his voice and ran out
Everybody wanna know what the ruckus all about y'all

Preach on Mr. Preacher Man, they say
Everybody wanna hear what you have to say
Stand tall, speak loud, boy that's the way
Them songs of yours, bring us a brand new day

Ha, ha (another day), ha
Hey, hey, heeey, ah (Lord I just gotta find a way)

See good Lord, I've been waitin so long
For y'all to come out here and take me in the home
The world's so cold with no place to belong
They said ""come on in boy, sing your song""
He stepped inside and to his surprise
It was so damn fly, he can't believe his eyes
Ate and he drank and he felt satisfied
'Til he sat by the window and he glanced out-side
Loved ones out workin
Eyes got full and his heart started hurtin
Cause them folk been singin for years
But ain't any one of them set foot up in here
Hold up, how you get so much
Livin off folk like us that got it so rough
The way you hold 'em in your cold clutch
Makes me think that you don't love your own soul enough

Preach on Mr. Preacher Man, they say
Everybody wanna hear what you have to say
Stand tall, speak loud, boy that's the way
Them songs of yours, bring us a brand new day
Preach on Mr. Preacher Man, they say
Everybody wanna hear what you have to say
Stand tall, speak loud, boy that's the way
Them songs of yours, give us a brand new day


Closed his eyes as he sang every note
The songs he was taught and the ones that he wrote
Stood up, cleared his throat, grabbed his coat
In those last moments, a few words were spoke
""I used to peek at this old house in awe
Imaginin what it must be like and all
And this the finest spread these eyes ever saw
But I don't mind sayin I feel sorry for y'all
All that gettin, so little givin
Led a lot of y'all to forget what's missin
Built you a big pretty prison to sit in
Strut around here, convinced that that's livin
But we gonna keep on singin
Keep on solderin, keep on buildin
Keep on teachin and keep on listenin
And keep, keepin on, 'til the whole thing's different""

Said all his prayers and laid down his head
Everything said that he needed to say

Best@It,Us,2009,"Freeway got a voice like an electric guitar, I'm the bass to it
Walk to the speaker hold your face to it
Freezer

I'm 'bout to rip it straight from the rip
Body every beat the scriptures to me that we close to the end
Listen, Kill 'em with the spit and put my boys in position
So none of my niggas got to pitch on the street
It's Young Freezer the bar spitter the big beard
From the city of brotherly hate where we bear eagles
The desert kind and we pay them coppers no never mind
Niggas still palm heaters
My hood is bad they turn teen they grab ninas
A couple aunts one mother no dad
Streets was their father figure and they never had
That's why they run up in your spot with a couple Glocks
Had hunger pains I couldn't make it to eat
Got introduced to Islam started making Salat
We in two different cities
Minnnesota and Philly
But I'm on the same page as Brother Ali

Yeah Joell Ortiz, get it

I Ain't make believe like some of these costume fuckers
So YAOWA, I literally got you Brother
Ain't a hood too rough ain't a block too gutter
These rappers starting to look like them pork chops you smother
Slide me a fork damn right I eat pork
I'm sick I dine on the swine flu with every thought
Every track I rhyme to develops a heavy cough
Till it's fully blown and it turns into a smelly corpse
I'm eatin' I ain't fat this just how my belly floss
I'm on the road so much I'm build me a telly porch
Bitches be hawkin', I be turnin' my celly off
They crazy like the ass on Miss Tracee Ellis Ross
Come home early I might be in that bed of yours
Girls like me I'm sort of like a walking metaphor
And this mic seems like it kinda just might be...a gift and a curse
They give me ass and curse me out when I don't make 'em wifey
I'm on the set mic check like your favorite Nikes
A Rhyme Sayer so it's only right that they invite me
On the track with 'em. I'm oozing that rap rhythm
Could rhyme forever whatever. I'll let Ali scrap with 'em

Some of the greatest got respect for the way that I rock the set
But you ain't seen no Jacob shit dangling off my neck
So of course, dudes around the way are all suspect
Why them Rhymesayers boys ain't break you off with a check
Wait a minute it's not that I ain't get it
It's just that I'm considerate
And shit about they way I spend it
You ain't never heard me say I'm pimpin'
I referee the game I'm in and so I play it different
I Need the deed to my home and the title to my car
Make sure that my health and my life are all insured
If I ain't got all four I consider myself poor
Diamonds to the floor is something I can not afford
You see these cats and most of them are lying
Selling CDs and packs, both of them are dying
My man Free earned that shit it ain't a costume
And I ain't 'bout to cop a fake joint to give props to 'em
You ain't seen nothing crazy on my arm (Ha Ha Hum)
My kids got a stay at home mom
Until my grand kids are straight I ain't buying jewelry
And truly can't thank my fans enough for what they do for me
Industry suits wasn't digging my jams
I tour like a madman build my brand
Soundscan never meant nothing to the fans
They ain't in it for the trends they want to listen to the man
I give 'em what I can and when I'm in the jam
I get to spittin' so ridiculous they pissing in their pants
They listen every chance that they can get it their hands
Until they wear the CD out and go and get that shit again
God damn it got me back on my rap shit
Got that home run king batting average
Achievements, no 'roids taken, no astrict, don't need it
No styles bitten, no ass kissed
Believe it
Record is flawless my respect is enormous
My current peer group is a short list
Only way I lose if I forfeit
The only way you climb in these shoes is if I tire of the throne and climb off it
Dont' hold your breath on it
Only begun
If you ain't the Rhymesayers I don't owe you a crumb
Can't no MC call me his son
The lowest ever been uttered is kid brother but that's only been one
I paved my own road to the sun
My aura glow has become
A beacon of hope the closer I come
I'm sorry there can only be one
Champ around here I am not a peer
I'm up here, you down there
Look down and the ground's near
Au contraire I hear your heart pound fear loud and clear
Feet of sasquatch
MC's are mad soft
Make their weak ass glass jaw meet the asphalt
Better hope Ali don't blast off
He'll twist your hand off
Take you in the back and saw the cast off
Can't slow him up the more he get the more he want
They steady telling me hip hop is in some sort of rut
That's cause they watching the TV and they ignoring us
It ain't my fault they fail to see that we done tore it up
I'm from a broken mold y'all are from that carbon cut
That shit has all been done before
I'm here to call your bluff
I don't compare myself to dead rappers
I'm here to write the next chapter in braille and left handed
Consider yourself reprimanded

Bad Mufucker Pt. 2,Us,2009,"That was, that was the end
And it squashed the whole beef

I'm so incredibly nasty
Yes my Mama slapped me when she had me
Told me get your ass out with your Daddy
Talked hella trash and my teachers couldn't stand me
Used to call me bastard and told me I was trashy
Unsupervised child, they call me a Latchkey
At-risk youth from a single parent family
Nuts got hairy and my voice got raspy
Crews were getting acne, I was getting savvy
Yes I'm a bad motherfucker, understand me
Grew up beaten, broken glass, rapping in the alley
Got my hands dirty, I was hiding in a trash heap
Hopping out, knocking out cats, grabbing they ten speed
Little boys and the girls, they both pack heat
Both had something I need from em in they pants see
Broads got the booty all felt up in the back seat
Dudes got they lunch money boosted and they ass beat
Can I get it back, fuck naw, don't even ask me
When you see the Preacher
Keep your peace and don't you dare speak
None of y'all snitches ain't in the same class as me
We ain't the same cause you wrote a couple raps G
That cover charge that you payin is my salary
Merchandise you carry away is all tax free
Facing all my bills and I count my money carefully
Bet your fucking ass ain't nobody ever jack me, see

You's a bad motherfucker man
On the other hand, you never see a sucker stand close to where the Brother stand
You God damn right about that
Got me so pissed off, I wanna fight em out back

My nuts done swung all around the planet
Where the fuck y'all from
I already captured it, 
I bust my gun
Had a little cannon kid
Caught a little accident, slid em in the ambulance
He asked for this rumble, his ass got trouble
I'm picking glass out of my knuckles like that's comfortable
Where you running to, you ever wanna a true
Bad motherfucker, you accept no substitute
No understudy dudes and no number
Two
Trust when it come to busting loose, I'm the ugly truth
You ever want the proof, you can check the documents
Or you just watch the kid break door with my fist
I'm on some shit
Your old lady grabbing on the kid like she chose me

Come on now, quit bullshittin)
 - 2X
Sunset never seemed so long
FIre in sky still goin strong
Jewel in the crown keep holdin on
Never let it go 'til it's all gone

I glide across the surface with my head held high
Shoulders pushed back, I'm convinced I'll never die
Got a squint to my eye like I can't take the world in
Too much beauty to behold by one person
Wear the sky around my shoulder like a tailor made cloak
Create or decorated with my never fadin hopes
My same old skin like the robe of a King
Gold, platinum bling happen to grow
From my chin
Sun keeps kissin my cheek as if it has to
And the Earth under my feet become a castle
Any word I endeavor to speak, I command you
Die grammar plan to make the Devil unhand you
Should the elements change and it ever rain
Drops fall around me, my garment is never stained
This is what God had in mind for me
Shine like the stars in the sky just align for me


There's a certain type of glow that emanates
Off the authentic that a fake could never imitate
He thought his outstretched hand might conceal his hate
Never knew his eyes where the windows to his real estate
I'll gladly be the mirror that you hate
To crush every debate, why the fuck you're never great
You'll still be the same irrelevant bitch
In the same predicament if I never existed, shit
My shadow isn't why it's cold where you at
My goals and advancements ain't what's holdin you back, bitch
You're illest enemy is in the looking glass
But you really couldn't stand starin at your crooked ass
So you workin every single angle
Thinkin you'd be the man if I wasn't here to compare to
My advice to you is to do the fuck you
And if you ain't willin my dude, then fuck you

The Preacher,Us,2009,"Intro:
Hit me hard, now
Ladies and gentlemen, you made the right choice this evening
Chorus: (X2)
If you know me, you know I
Love my family love my God
Before I knew either I loved my art
So I'm married to the pen till death do us part
Rock hard with all my heart
College broads call me avant garde
Probably cause I'm all off the chart
Only thing poppy about me
Is what my Puerto Rican mami call me when she on me
And the raw me is all I let y'all see
I believe I rock it properly
Obviously a lot of y'all agree
Remind me, what the fuck can stop Ali?
Only me as far as I can see
Line 3 of ""My Philosophy""
By BDP, it apply to me
I'm just the guy to lead a crew
That means the true people who believe in you
And hold you down and do what they need to do
Street Preacher
Say you don't believe what these people teach
Well me neither
He who follows his dream is deemed leader
The freedom fighter meets the peace keeper
See me creeping up in the pulpit
With a full clip fit to speak to the people
May I suggest you just believe dude?
Everything he speak on, really true
He's proved he would never mislead you
Or treat you as nothing less than equal
That's why they call me Brother Ali, too
The feeling always seems to bleed through
No quitting I kill it until the beats through
No kidding I'm real in everything we do
Rap beef bullshit so see through
They don't like the hoops they got to leap through
So they turn on each other like the weak do
Your little teeth chew meat, fool me too
Chorus (X2)
Rest assured I'm the best to do it in my neck of the woods
Hell yes I'm good
You can give me any test and I'll prove it no question
Let this be a lesson to you
When a superior send a message through the air waves
Your way, fool, just accept it
And consider it a blessing
I won't rest till the moment they press play
This jam come down and cave your chest in
There's a couple more things y'all have to know
Y'all been violating the rapper code
Can't just walk around here acting bold
Got to earn respect to brag and boast
Skills get you that not swag and clothes
Chin might get tapped, I crack your nose
Fall back before y'all collapse
Me, I'm an artist all a y'all are acts
That's why my heart bleed all on the track
Tell me what the fuck's wrong with that
Y'all foreplaying I'm raw dogging that
I lead the way cause y'all lost the path
This dialogue is all about the facts
That's why my stories are hard to match
Never been afraid at all, follow that
Chorus (X2)
Preacher in here this evening
Let me see your hands if you believe him
I don't know but I got this feeling
These people need some healing
And there just so few real ones
I got just what you're seeking
That giant can't keep sleeping
Wake up and touch that freedom",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-the-preacher-lyrics
Slippin’ Away,Us,2009,"I arrived in Minnesota with handcuff bruises
Summer ninety deuce, prepared to cut loose shit
Mom wasn't havin that, fuck bein cool
With no discussion, stuck me in a suburb school
Now day and night I'm on a bus full of fools
Who parents didn't want us ended up in the news
You must be crazy, you think any of us appreciate it
How our parents wanna upgrade us
All day long we're in a fantasy land
Moms and dads, college plans and minivans
But when the sun set, you fled the success
To the slum where you rest, nothin more, nothin less
School they fantasize about gangsta rap records
But these are our lives, our families are connected
The Ice Cube summer vacation is takin place
Right around the way from where I stay
The mold from the gold and the 'rips from L.A
Brought, snow to the cold for a new place to play
There's a war goin on outside, you ain't safe from
See if this education might save 'em

I've known you your whole life
You drawn to that street life
Slippin away, slippin away
Slippin away, slippin away

And so our little city bus crew used to run together
Eat lunch together, girls Double Dutch together
Fellas humbuggin, next day be friends
The only thing we never did was date from within
Fellas dated white girls, sisters stayed lonely
Used to kiss me on my cheek and say we were homies
Alphonso basement, we ran the party
One day on the bus, Pumpkin stabs Akey
Shit, my main man was Ethan
Used to sell sneakers at a store called Friedman's
He had two older cousins that were hustlers
Filas wasn't all he pumpin to the customers
He got a check but he got connects
So he got some chicks and he got respect
His boy Ali got hooked up with clothes
One day slap boxin, he broke my nose
He almost cried man, he had a good heart
The brother's only problem was he wasn't book smart
He dropped out of school but he kept slangin shoes
To keep the kids fed, he had to sell base too


Time to time I used to stop in and check on my dude
Even when we lost touch with the rest of our crew
We both had babies, drama with our old ladies
But as time went on, our connection only grew
He said ""I just can't seem to leave these streets alone man
Feels like I fell asleep one evening
And woke up the next day suddenly a grown man
In a rut with no idea how to leave it
My parents got too many kids to help me through
I really don't know what the hell else to do
I know you gonna really get it crackin with that rap thing
And when you blow up, I'm a come and work for you""
Ha, that's my man, I see you when I see you brother
Keep your head up 'til the next time we see each other
Rolled out on my first national tour
Back on the block, went back to the store
Put my hand on the door, Ethan wasn't in though
They said somebody shot 'em through his front window
Hit 'em in the head and that he hadn't survived
Matter fact he died 'fore the ambulance arrived
A man in that life, it wasn't no mistake
The cops called it a stray bullet, closed the case
So there's no justice and there's no closure
You can't touch this, not you, no sir
They buried my brother, I was on the road
By the time I got home, the ground was cold
Got nothin left but a hole in my soul
Shit, dude was 23 years old

House Keys,Us,2009,"Baby can I talk to you for a minute?
I know you noticed things been tight around here lately
We don't really need all three of these bedrooms
If you really think about it, we could live without it
There's a vacant spot one floor beneath for more cheap
We could afford it easy
Wouldn't have to really pack
Borrow your granddad's van or no shit like that
Save a hundred fifty each month
Go to Red Lobster and eat what we want
Moved down, gave keys to the landlady
But I kept the spare set that she had gave me
It was cheaper but I actually regret
Couldn't even tell you were the extra money went
Can't go back now it's too late
New people moved into our old space
Of course they loud as a son of a bitch
Not just partying they wild on some other shit
They selling something out of there
All night you can hear people up and down the stairs
But shit I ain't telling them they wrong
I just learn to sleep with the television on
And every single Wednesday they be gone
From nine till about at least eleven in the morn
I get a little peace from the floor boards creaking
And sleep in cause there isn't anybody home
Shit they getting worse lately
They fuse and they curse and they wake up the baby
Last Tuesday night a fight broke out
And somebody let a gun off in the house
And so the very next morning, I listened through the floor until I heard them all leave
Crept upstairs with my old keys
Walked in a and helped myself to the whole thing
Half pound of weed and a coke stash
A new 45 and a little stack of cash
Caught me a cab to St. Paul
Selling them things that cheap, man it ain't hard
Come home with close to 4 Gs
Plus saved my man a taste of the trees
Now I can hear them going crazy upstairs
Probably should have just kept our ass up there",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-house-keys-lyrics
Games,Us,2009,"Ah, what's up man? (What up Ali?)
Ah, you still standing on this motherfuckin corner?
Shit ain't you 30 years old, motherfucker?

Ah, so when I pick up the microphone I know what I'm sayin
Wasn't long ago was facin the same situation
Carpet got ripped from me pacin
The rent's a month late, ain't shit on the way, I'm straight prayin
Ends don't meet unless you make 'em
The people don't eat unless you scrape and you see they ain't playin
Corner store credit is way thin
The World got it's way of weighin on your shoulders, it's degradin
It's like we got frowns tattooed on our faces
The school's ain't savin our new generation
Stare at our kids, they need a paradigm shift
The paradox is that parents aren't shit
Why you got cable? Your life is not stable
Lights not paid for, Nikes on layaway though
It's like we wanna look good while we drownin
Should grab a paddle and scrap our way out
 - 2X
Life's not a good when you livin it like this
Leave your lane for a minute, you might flip
It's like chains on your neck with a tight grip
Use your brain in this shit and you might live

While you in the drug game, my hustle got another name
You dyin, makin somebody rich, it's the fuckin same
So quick to call a square job, Brother lame
Truth be told, you might wanna choose another lane
Yeah I'm bussin 'til my bitch ass job
You on the corner, pushin them bitch ass rocks
And yes I'm gettin sweated by my bitch ass boss
Your ass steady runnin from them bitch ass cops
This shit don't stop, the game ain't new
The pen's full of dudes who thought the same shit too
That TV is a blind fold, here to keep your eyes closed
Sell your crack and it's all dough and fly clothes
Shit ain't nothin like ""The Sopranos""
Real talk, you're probably better off at McDonald's
Rappers all say they went from hustlin to rhymin
But look, everybody say the other one's a liar


Man, fuck you Brother Ali
You always runnin your mouth
Just cause you got that rap shit cool
Man we on these streets motherfucker
Get out here and see how it is

It don't matter about me rappin, my ass is still scratchin
Some day, I'm a be the ""yo, remember back when?""
While I'm hear I got to really make it happen
Try to have emergency landing, instead of crashin
Fuck sayin I've been here, brother I am here
Might not live here this year but I still care
Not talkin down to you, straight to you
No player hater my dude, it's plain true
Gotta live like don't nobody love you but you
As long as your blood move, tragedy could touch you
Struggle ain't nothin new, cards ain't gonna always land how you want
'em too
Fuck it though, thug it through
Can't give up, as much as you'd love to
There's certain shit as a man we must do
You God damn right they made it like this
But I ain't tryin to wait for the day they might fix",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-games-lyrics
’Round Here,Us,2009,"Brother Ali is back in town
Came a long way to make that sound
Break through Earth from hallowed ground
Played with my blood to wear this crown
Brother Ali is back in town
World on my shoulder, weigh me down
Break through Earth from hallowed ground
Played with my blood to wear this crown

Uh, fact about it, I'm a force of nature
Leader of men, boss of my organization
I ain't in to bein ostentatious
I offered the pages that caught a lot of y'all in the Matrix
Soon as I caught a break, I was off to the races
Invaded the remotest possible places
Seen it first hand, yeah it's hard to explain it
I've been around the world, left my heart on them stages
They want your boy, all all on they faces
Hollered out a roar, they holla in amazement
I follow all the greatest, A-list, taste makers
That shaped this and they're all innovators
I'm so firmly grounded in the basics
Yeah, dishonor, get pounded to the pavement
Dealin with the voice of the nameless, faceless
Face it, your participation ain't gonna be painless
I won't debate that I'm sort of a sadist
I use most your faces to sharpen my blade with
Combat takin place, not entertainment
Lives been lost, it's a hostile arrangement


Uh, your eyes never spied where I've been
Low parts where the heights of rhymin
Back alleys where the dice is flyin
Darkness is tryin, the lights are blindin
Sheist environment, the nights are violent
Red beam silent, the siren's cryin
Clean mighty tights or your life survivin
Nights where the roaches or mice might slide in
The highest you can climb is that limelight
And so downin on that mic meant fightin
Braggin rights are all that you rhyme with
Can't stand to see all your pride get sliced in
When the spotlight hit, my shit, y'all just
Bet I'm a stomp this motherfuckin party 'til it's cold and lifeless
Close your eyelids, behold the righteous
It's cold as night gets


There was a standoff
And there's like a Russian dude, a old, black pimp dude
Some gangsta black dude, some Armenian dude
Like a motley crew, literally
Like a weirdo but street, angry, grown ass men
Against me and Dibbs and Art and the God Loves Ugly crew
And it's like a line and I walk in between 'em
And I just start goin off
Like Cuz, Blood, like mother, fucker
I'm a get on the phone and I'm a make everybody cry
I'm just talkin crazy, I'm mad, this is my hometown
I'm about to call the homies
But you know like the old pimp dude had a piece or somethin
Like a gun or somethin
And it was about to jump off
And then he goes like ""oh, ain't you Brother Ali?""
Brother Ali, you a bad motherfucker man",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-round-here-lyrics
Brothers & Sisters,Us,2009,"Brothers and sisters
The world we share is filled with such despair
And such pain
We're a people at odds with our very own selves
The rich neglect the poor
The young resent the old
We're divided by race, divided by religion
Our politicians rob us and our leaders fail us
I think it's safe to say that we are our only hope
Our speaker tonight is a soldier in the war for love
He carries with him a message of true hope and true peace
I pray that you will listen with open hearts and open minds
Brothers and sisters
Put your hands together and welcome Brother Ali",https://genius.com/Brother-ali-brothers-and-sisters-lyrics
