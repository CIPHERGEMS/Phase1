Every time I fuck I gotta hit me least like two bitches
Boy, that dope been whipped, you need like new wrists
Foreign car outside, that bitch got two digits
Money stand like eight feet just like two midgets

Who the fuck told you that Young Thugger Thugger don't fuck up the beat?

No, I'm not Nipsey, not from L.A., but I got keys to the city
I fuck it, I suck it, I beat it down, then she beat me to the ceilin'
Stoner my lifestyle, I'm livin' too wild
I came to make you proud, that money keep her around
In love with her head, I can't turn it down
Can't wait for my time to come back around
She see that you don't got Lil Haiti's style
Plus I just seen Snoop on Girls Gone Wild
I just bought a Bentley and a bitch came with it
Young rich nigga hittin' million dollar licks
Balling in New York like a motherfucking Knick
You better have them racks, you ever want to hear me spit
And everywhere I go I gotta pass like the staff

Young nigga rich, jewelry colder than the attic
If she ain't a virgin, then that bitch is only average

I can't learn a bitch, but I learned mathematics

Hot, hot, hot, hot
Hot, hot, hot, hot
Hot, hot, hot, hot
Hot, hot, hot, hot

Everything litty, I love when it's hot
Turned up the city, I broke off the notch
Got some more millis, I keep me a knot
I created history and made me a lot
He tried to diss me and ended on Fox
We call them chopsticks 'cause they gonna chop
Took her out of Follies 'cause her pussy pop
I run it like Nike, we got it on lock

Cartier eye
I'm the bossman in a suit but no tie
I can't be sober, I gotta stay high
Pour me some syrup in a Canada Dry
Ridin' in the spaceship like Bonnie and Clyde
Don't worry, baby, I keep me some fire
Shenenehs and Birkins, she cannot decide
The latest Mercedes her go-to surprise
Don't sleep on miss lady, her pussy a prize
Dick in her back while I'm grippin' her sides
Bigger Maybach, this ain't regular size
We really fly, we like pelican glide
Bitch, you ain't slick, I can tell the disguise
Upgraded my wrist, put baguettes in that Sky
She sing, I might sign her and change her whole life
I told her to gargle and work on her highs

Everything litty, I love when it's hot
Turned up the city, I broke off the notch
Got some more millis, I keep me a knot
I created history and made me a lot
He tried to diss me and ended on Fox

Took her out of Follies 'cause her pussy pop
I run it like Nike, we got it on lock

Cash, money, checks, cash
Addy, Birkin, brand new extendos
I just wanna fuck the bitch by myself
I just passed her to the dawg like my Sprite

I took the Bentley coupe back, then I hopped in a Cayenne (Skrrt)
I put the bitch in the front of the Bentley, in front of the driver (Skrrt)
Ayy, man, this synthetic weed, you can't smoke in the Rolls Royce, woah, woah (Yeah, yeah)
I'm still double cupped up, I'm drinkin',
 I shoot off your tires, huh (Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo)
I'm in the coupe by myself
I had to kick a door when I was 5
Keep the awards on the shelf
Whole sixteen round in the fire
I'm sick and tired of these young niggas act like they firin', they tellin' these lies
Actin' like they the ones created this and they get all the drip from my guys
Yeah, Cartier eyes
Cartier coat, Cartiers the watch
Cartier love, Cartier the thot
Cartier specs, buffalo on the side
Princess cut diamonds, they Cartier, yeah
Cartier bag for the Cartier thot
Sky Wrangler coupe with two hundred the dash
Cartier jeans, ain't no way I can sag
Ain't no way I'ma ever gon' go out bad
I can't go out, no way I'ma go out
I just grip on her ass and I show out
I sit like a champ and I wait on a hold-out
I just whip up a new Chanel Patek
I whip with the wrist and I don't break the door out
Turn the whole top floor to a whorehouse
Hundred racks in ones, dude brought the flood out

I am not taking no disrespect
You Patrick Ewing, you pump fakin'
No that won't happen on me
I drop a key like the mufuckin' beat
I look good as your dad on a Friday
So many cars I gotta buy a driveway
Never gon' let 'em live a nigga crime day
Serving these X and P's instead of poppin'

Sandwiches, you know you in between
And you gotta know we at the green
You gotta be young nigga, wilder than Billie Jean
Gotta have paper for lawyer fees

She had Jacobsen sandals, you've been trapped in the bando
She has to trap in the bando 'cause her mama got cancer
She can't work in the States because her green papers ain't legal (Yeah)
Fuck a ""dame un beso"", she be like, ""Run de un peso"" (Alright)
Push the molly to Pedro so she can feed her abuelo
She refuse to just settle on them shoes with them red soles
And refuse to be nude in front of them dudes on that dance pole (Alright)
She can't lose, she just ooze a bunch of ambition like Nepo-
-Lian, I could be ruler and ride the streets on my Benzo
So, then she get money vicarious off her friends though
'Cause a kid named Birdy look nerdy but he be after the bando (Alright)
She robbed Birdy for birdies, now Birdy after her head though
Hold on I think I see Birdy and Birdy killed my Cuban ho (Ferg)",https://genius.com/Young-thug-old-english-lyrics

If a nigga ever got robbed, bitch I’m the manager
And I got an African with weed over on Campbelton
Lil momma don’t go, keep it stompin’, I want that cameltoe
Pull up to the set with them sticks and have us an ammo show
Lead through the front door with that tec, it's out the back door
Bags in this bitch, so many bags like where the racks go?

Givenchy my toes and my bros and my hoes, for real
Don't act like you don't know when you know that you know, for real

Can't find a bitch that don't know we them streets (We them streets)
Bitches know that I am Birdman, that's OG, brrat

But really what is it to do
When the whole world constantly hatin' on you?
Pussy niggas hold their nuts, masturbatin' on you
Meanwhile the fuckin' federal baitin' on you
Nigga tell me what you do
Would you stand up or would you turn to a pussy nigga?
I got a hundred things to do
And I can stop rappin' but I can't stop stackin' fuckin' figures

Nigga, I'm a crack addict
Thought about lettin' them get a cut
Then I went and snagged at it
Yeah, the new Boosie Badazz at it
I'ma drop a nigga life, just like a bad habit
I stick to the ground like a mothafuckin' rug
I'm a big dog, lil' fuck nigga, you a pup
Lil' bitch, clean your drawers before you think you're a thug
Before I be in front your shows, just like your pub
I ain't even lyin', baby
I swear to God I ain't lyin', baby, no
First I'll screw you without these pliers, baby, or
I might dap you like, ""good try, baby""
Big B livin', baby
Them boys on my left throwin' up Cs
I promise their mama see them this week
And I don't break promises with my Ds (Them my dogs)
I want Ms and cheese, mister Mickey Ds
She know I am a beast, I am so obese (Rrar)
In Miami I swear they don't got good weed
Wiz Khalifa can you send me some weed please?

Yeah, overseas, nigga, top floor, clear windows, nigga
Glass house, drankin' GT, you understand?
We in that Red Light District, you understand?
We 3 and 1, that mean 3 on me, nigga, you understand me?
Just livin' the life, boy, ayy, Thug, just a dollar for a 1, nigga
We can blow a mil', boy

You keep me 'ware lookin' like a peacock
Everytime we press she be rooster
Feelin' like the big block time shift

Flippin' on the mat yo
Like olympians in Rio, oh
Blast off like the rocket man, piano
Scream so loud, dolphins hear the signal

Ooh-woo, diamonds peek-a-boo
Ooh-woo, I done fucked her crew
Ooh-woo, I done did the robbin'
I done did the jackin', now I'm full rappin'
I put on my brothers, I put on my bitch
Had to wear the dress 'cause I had a stick
You know where the bag at, tell me where it is
I came from rags to riches, I'm the shit
I can no longer disguise it, bitch, 'cause I'm rich
I got cars galore, lil' bitch, 'cause I'm rich
I escaped every one of the licks 'cause I was supposed to be rich
I don't care nothin' 'bout no cop, I'm tellin' you just how it is

Put it in a Uber, send it to a shooter
Ask me how they do it, kickin' shit, Ryu, Ken
Put it in a cab, send it to a Arab
Hit 'em with the MAC now, now his whole body scabbed
Cash on delivery (Ayy)
G.O.A.T. talk of the century (Oh)
No time for gibberish, all the critics hearin' this
All the bitches lipstick, and her pussy slippery
I can call a troop, go by the name of Duke
Kidnap a kangaroo, I can send a moose (Woo)
Niggas stole a chain, but I ain't worried, fool

Show you how I can get the top from all the top ten bitches
I got white Adderalls and I have amoxicillin
I got lights on, baby, I got moths in this bitch
No fly zone, caught you like you're Moss in this bitch
Growin' tycoon and I took some losses, you bitch
I'm a boss, but I don't like to take a loss in this bitch 
(
Wheezy outta here

Such a player but I cake and cuddle all of my bitches
I got layers, I got millions, I got all type of buildings
Fuck around and air the pussy nigga out like linen
Last nigga tried me almost got popped in Lenox
Ask the cops, ask the detectives, they know all the business
Ask the cops and the detectives, all the jurisdictions
Ask the kids at school who ambition all the missions
Gave the lawyer close to two mil', he handle all the killings
I don't know and I don't wanna know who 'flaged Bentleys
I don't know what's goin' with bro, I think they all spillin'
We don't speak 'bout shit on wax, it's all mob business
We known to kill the biggest cats of all kitties

Sin,On the Rvn,2018.0,"Man, fuck all y'all (Just come wit' me)
Everything I do is for us only (Yeah, yeah)
Only us, none of y'all other niggas (I know none of y'all can't tell)
It's on God
(I'm in London, got my beat from London)

Ayy, ayy, I'm drippin' again
The way that I drip this shit should be a sin
Ayy, ayy, divorce all my friends
I'm not a Migo, 'bout to trap out the Benz
Ayy, they told me don't spend
I went got the racks and I did it again
Ayy, I think she a twin
Plus she got red calamari skin
Ayy, you don't got no wins
You should grab something white and just throw it on in
I went to school, got suspended
I told her I want some head, bobby pin
If the lil... don't got class, yeah, we call it truancy
I ain't had no money to spend
I got my first check and went paid off my rent

I poured a four from the clouds down
And my head floating in bliss (Goddamn)
I'm on the phone with big bro now (Damn)
He told me keep Benz on the race (Goddamn)
Until you see it like this, I promise man you'd never think it exists
Straight out a jet to the crib, I'm quick with the switch
Man we never miss, okay (God)
'Bout to turn up in the club, man, back the fuck up
We ain't takin' no pictures
See all the wings in the front, it's us
We had to triple the digits
See all those sexy mamas blowing kisses, man
We had to grant all they wishes (We grants-)
Casamigos got me spinnin'
But I want some spendin' some out wit' some dealers
Let's go (Goddamn)

I'm rocking Dior Sauvage (Damn)
I'm higher than Scotty, they calling me Pippen (God)
I got some Cartier vision, it costs me six thousand
I'm watchin' these women
Money's the reason I'm sinning
Money's the reason I gotta take Ritalin
You niggas don't care 'bout women
Just shut the fuck up, yeah I'm taking care plenty
I put Chanel on a belt buckle, of when my price is half off
I keep a stick for my cover, got way more girls than Hugh Hefner
Got the same name as the butler
But more money than Ashley and her mother
Got a backwood full of sherbert, I'm 'bout to smoke like a murder

Ayy, ayy, I'm dripping again
The way that I drip this shit should be a sin
Ayy, ayy, divorce all my friends
I'm not a Migo, 'bout to trap out the Benz

I ain't had no money to spend
I got my first check and went paid off my rent

Ooh, hop out the back of the turn up
Avoid all the cameras, I did it on purpose
She tryna act like she perfect
I see all the masks that you leave on the surface
She made me write all my verses in cursive
She need all them purses at Hermès
That's like 25 racks and we always on a roll
Man, we always working, let's go

Ay, let me pour up some Act, got some brand new graffiti
It's going down my back
I got Chanel slippers, Gucci pennies, baby, girl you can pick
Rocking Giuseppe Zanotti's a night
I spent half a million designer on kits
I got Chanel slippers, Gucci pennies, baby girl you can pick
I got so high, went off the equator, I feel like Buzz Lightyear
I met a broad, skinny like nails, and I was richer than ice cream
I had to grind without a rail, now all my cars got Nitron
Straight to Dubai, I feel like the mail, I was on a Global Express

I got a bad bitch, she said she always had shit
All these flawless diamonds, yeah they're lookin' glassy
Catch that nigga slippin', I'ma do 'em nasty
Check out my attire, this expensive fabric
And we can wrestle just like Randy Savage
My jewelry as cold as an attic
The kushy that I smoke'll blow your lungs out
I'ma walk in and clutch it like it's a war house
All your bitches thats busted, they live in your house
What goes up comes down, my nigga, north south
I done ran up them M's without a tour now
She done stepped up her game, Christian couture now
These niggas thought that they knew it but they don't know it now
I swear to God they're pursuin' at all my shows now

Ayy, hopped out my 'vette and hopped right in a foreign (Skrrt)
Ayy, bitch don't get close, this a mothafuckin' warning
Ayy, suck that dick good, I'm the mothafuckin' warden
Ayy, she runnin' away from my weed like it farted
She don't wanna swallow so I put it on her neck
I beat that pussy up, she loud as a parade
I got 1 million but only 10 in the bank
I taste a sample, I only buy if it's dank
I cook fishscale, and sang to her same time like Tank
I was born in '91, 23 years old with a whole lotta stain

All my diamonds need to be drained
I got a gangsta bitch that's gon' bang
And I got racks up, I can't complain
And all my dogs, they're dirty, check for mange

And I'm a gangsta, my nuts, they gon hang

Never loved a bitch but I love money
In the church payin' my tithes with drug money, thank you
Went and got a new plug, got mama a new house
And a couple new coupes, that's how a young nigga live
Couple bitches, good weed that how a nigga chill
Top floor, penthouse, still crackin' seals

Them New York niggas say that young nigga ill...it's Dolph

Hey, my uncle always told me pack the steel
Hey, that nigga Thugger, that's my mothafuckin' brotha
From a motherfuckin' 'nother, I'ma show you how to make magic

Fuck that, where your friends at?"" Dammit

I ain't even crippin' but I got a mothafuckin' clue and it's blue

But if you're wrong, you gon' get the rest, nigga
I'ma put a lot of metal in his chest just like a vest, nigga

Big racks got me walkin' with a limp
Buyin' Rollies on Rollies like I'm Flavor Flavor's shrimp
Versace cover, roll that bitch up like some weed
She whip that ass like her name Neff B
I got more karats than a cavity
Baby don't pull it out of your teeth
We go shoppin' at Bal Harbour for the beach
Ain't talkin' car but I need her to spoil me
And I'ma beat that pussy, concrete
Like a mothafuckin' street
I'ma feed her my milk
Every time I feel tired, I need three hoes like a elf
You're a ho, ho, ho; don't care, I'ma keep it all to myself
Tie my ties on your belt
Wit' ya 'til ya dead and pale
I heard someone's there walked in and said

Okay lil' mama sharp with a razor
Okay lil' mama fresher than a blazer
No way, I cannot fuck it in the anus
Hey yeah, baby we get kurt, no Angle
And I got stripes like a bengal
And I can send 'em from every angle
Holy ghost with an angel
Holy moly mang
I'ma stand up right beside my baby
If a pussy nigga play he might just die by my baby
Shoulda never tried my baby
No we don't die, we multiply my baby
Hurry up and sign it my baby
It's simple just sign the dotted line my baby
I pull up and ride with my baby
New Rollie for my child and my baby

Eli Manning, Peyton Manning throwin' dick in that hole
She told me that she love the way I dress, like a prince but I'm a boy
I made the chart
And like Wayne, baby it's all at the start
Girl I'm just startin' with that pussy
I eat ya hunny bun ya pussy
You have me smilin' when you're lookin'
Big ole' round booty soft as cushion
Stop talkin', pussy nigga, you a wussy
Tryna reach, nigga, he might be bookin'
Sprayin' my cologne now we smell just like some cookies
And if you suck that dick, don't kiss my jaw or else I'm mushin'
Daddy time, daddy time
Got a room full of big booty bitches, it's my prime
Filled with iron, filled with iron
I throw some ones, baby catch it like the swine
I fill my truck up with nothin' but that diesel
I let that MAK-90 vibrate just like a beeper
Y'all livin' cheaper, nigga this the sequel
I'm laughin' at these pussy niggas like a hyena

Okay lil' mama sharp with a razor
Okay lil' mama fresher than a blazer
No way, I cannot fuck it in the anus
Hey yeah, baby we get kurt, no Angle
And I got stripes like a bengal
And I can send 'em from every angle

King of lions, who let these cats run out of the house?

I never had cutlass and donks
I based up my bankroll then based out my trunk

On top like Scotty 2 Hotty
Load up the fire then I light it
Shootin' shit get me excited
Double C cups, fuck the titties, I try it
Piece of me inside her mouth call it trident
Nigga having sex on a boat
I got my water on, I need me a float
I am, the black kid where is all my folks
I slimed them out then I left 'em on the shore
I got bands on me, yes I meant plural
I am, so fresh man I feel like I'm a tourist
And I want 50 whole bands for a chorus
Everytime I ball you know that I'ma score
Please take off them drawers man you making Thug bored

Ain't in no prision but when I appear
You see my diamonds from far but I'm near
Blingin', I'm blingin', my chopper gon' ring, yes I ring it
Off em' no reason, I kill em on spot at Four Seasons
Ice skating like Lupe Fiasco
Ima stack them hundreds tall no Rango
And I'm only 23 but I got stains though
When we kill em we won't hold any remains though
I'm the fucking Randy Savage
Riding with the karats and the bad bitches
Nigga must be a crip cause he drinking so much red, it ain't Actavis
Ima start from the middle then I'm headin' to the top then I'm going deep all in that pussy
Lil baby want all of my cream and you know its all white I'm mushy

Pussy nigga know that he a cat like Tigger

Beat the pussy nigga with the baseball bat
Pull up with them F&Ns comin' out the hatch
Pussy mothafucka scared to say it to my front
So I'm blowin' out his back
Point it at his liver, make the nigga reconsider
Bands in my pants got me lookin' a little bigger
Red just like Elmo but I never fuckin' giggle
You can suck my pickle for a nickel

Eww eww eww
Eww eww eww, eww

How many niggas standin' around you would die for you?
I’m not bein' funny but if I come through there sprayin'
All them niggas turn to 4 wheelers
Honestly, truth be told, YSL won't fold
Pick his ass off from the balcony
Walk into the house and change clothes
YSL, wipe a nigga nose
We don't give a damn if it's indoors or outdoors
We gotta have that, gon' grab that
Nigga go stab that, smack that shit
Every day I keep the bands on me, I'm a lick
If a nigga think I'm sweet then his tongue gettin' split
I ain't doin' any features unless you give me your bitch
I'ma fuck for the cash then she gettin' robbed by Tick

Make the mothafucka dance on the stage

50 whole k spent on my hygiene
Drinkin' so much lean that my pee clean
808 just might be the dream team
Bitch got some good brain, call her Pinky
Bag full of weed, no lighter
In the kitchen wrappin', rappin' like a cypher
You know damn well, I like her, I'mma bite her
In a Bentley on West Lee gettin' trailed by sniper
How the fuck you feel that I don't mean nothin'?
All them years in the bando, no clean nothin'
Runnin' to the cops, tell 'em I don't serve the fiend nothin'
Pullin' off like ""SIKE!""
Bitch I got the bando, fifty hundreds
Spot 'round the corner filled up with onions
Big homie got a whole truckload
Me and Scooter take a trip to New Mexico
All I ever wanted was the money
All I ever wanted was the money
Put your hands in the air if you dare
Any motherfucker to step over here

Watch the city go missing, the young nigga ran off with lil biddy birds
Fuck you talkin', bitch you ran off on 'em
How these lil handcuffs and you cops can't cuff me
In the back of the cab, this ho sucking dick from the front seat
This her aftermath, like I got 50 Cent on me (straight stacks)

Nigga got a couple choppers on the floor
Watch that door (watch that door)
Watch that door (you gotta watch that door)
Watch that door

Happy four twenty, roll up two point fives
Way too stoned, don't remember these guys
Hold up, so high I'ma risk my life, ain't even tryna go to these skies
Hold up strollers

I make a slut slut
I eat it cold cut
Hair getting longer
Weed getting stronger
'Bout to strong arm her
'Bout to go and bone girl
She got a cameltoe, I call her Marlboro

And I slide around in that Snoop DeVille
And my gas tank is on full
Stack goods, them Backwoods
We cock back and we pull
Bubblegum, cookies, OG, and KK
We like Craig and Dae Dae, who gives a fuck what they say?

I'm the same nigga that you bitch niggas plotted on
It ain't as easy as I make it look
See what I'm sayin', I ain't playin', nigga take a look
We on that G shit, nigga we lit, and I'm seasick for real
Thugger Thug, what it does, let's get this motherfuckin' money cuz
I mean that new money, that blue money with new faces
Them new cases and new bases and new aces
Florida-anapolis, ain't no stoppin' us
Power preaches patience
Balling in two places
Exchanges, smoke faces

Count this money on a PJ in my PJs
Goin' fast, gettin' tonsils on the E-way
Smoking on that OG
I flooded my AP, got me a Rollie
I got a bad bitch and I call her dopey
And her head dope
And she suck me off the perky, keep her hands off

Shootin' a 223, DVD
Watch me shoot a foe, way down the street
Cost a whole hunnid band, band with the heat

Had a talk with Thug, we was talkin' 'bout Escobar (Pablo!)
Snitches the only thing a rich nigga stressin' for
Remember we was riding on the MARTA bus
They'd rob the bank before they think 'bout robbing us
We did this shit ourself, we ain't ask for no help
He'll kill for Terrell, I'll kill for lil' Jeff
So now we got right, these niggas went left
Ridin' 'round with them straps, I ain't talkin' seat belts
I swear to God I'll murk 'em if Thugger say the word
We went from robbing these niggas to selling bricks and birds
They had the nerve to say they don't like me riding with Thug
But at first, they liked to see a friend in clubs

You didn't really get her wet, 'cause you're big pussy
Nigga shootin' a jammin' TEC, 'cause you're big pussy
You'll get fingered with a clip, you's a big pussy
Let a nigga snatch your necklace, you're big pussy
I rock all water baguettes on you big pussies

Bal Harbours, and I was fresh out of charters
Louis V joggers, green Birkin, that Frogger
She with that nose bleed
She was gettin' high as she 'posed to be
I'm in another league
Whenever I ride, they notice me
She gave her throat to me
I bought her a big face Rollie-ie
She breakin' your code with me
I bought her the rose gold rosary
Jump in the back, this is a bulletproof 'Lac
500 racks, baby said, ""Don't get fat""
Extra racks, what I charge 'em to cook up is crack
Who been in the sack? 'Bout to set up a lil' mousetrap

You's a pussy nigga, you's a pussy
You's a pussy nigga, you's a, you's a pussy (Woah)

Suck you some dick or I'm shootin' your man, jack

Fuck 'em with the F&N
She like to take molly, she pop a capsule with the Thug
If I fall in love like Danny Glover
You bitches know I'm not ballin', these bitches know I'm not touchin'
They want to plead to Thug and then nip it in the bud
This announcement should be publical
I want to come from Uranus
I'm livin' my life mechanical, she leave white stains on my jeans
I'm a red bull, I need wings
She let Metro get between
He bling, she fiend, she Billie no Jean
She wing, she mad, she try cause a scene
Pull up in a panorama
Let her read my lips, I wanna hit it from the bi-nack
Illest nigga livin', watch me turn up on a partner

They need to let go, before it stretch like Fruit Roll-Ups
They're strippers I know this
And all they ass fat, they fuck up my focus
No, I didn't call up my bro, no call up my whoadie
They pull up unnoticed
Come running with slime, Nickelodeon
I check in and check out the club
Baby, I don't have time for no more
You can have that back
I just had it the trap spot for sure
I swear I just saw my brother get a fuckin' life sentence
And I know my momma still in pain
That's why I'ma kill him when I catch him in the village
Fuck nigga done changed up the game
You supposed to held a nigga down for the chain

That's why I'm chillin' and things

Rarri,Slime Season,2015.0,"Got a 'Rari with the engine in the back
Every neighbor know a nigga servin' crack
Chasing cheese, but I cannot be a rat
Screamin' free Gucci Mane, no Mack
I just finished doin' some business with the hat back
I'ma take a nigga head like a snap back
I'ma hit her with this wood, no mousetrap
Take a five-hour rest, ball it catnap

Treat her like a Bentley, take the top up off that bitch
I got hoes drinkin' syrup like a waffle on that dick
I made all my pockets grow like Pinocchio, lil' bitch
Either way, money'll grow, just know I'm tryna get rich
Baby, I wanna cash out on you in it for my pride
Baby, I bought a Audi and I gave it to my mother
These niggas, they cowards, they won't even kill each other
Even though I got rhymes, I bust shit just like a bubble
Hey I ran up my racks and I’m killin' 'em by the day
Treat her like she got tatted, she covered with Olay
Not a big fan of acne, but she like it in her face
I'm in the West Coast bangin' like I'm in the A

Got a 'Rari with the engine in the back
Every neighbor know a nigga servin' crack
Chasing cheese, but I cannot be a rat
Screamin' free Gucci Mane, no Mack
I just finished doin' business with the hat back
I'ma take a nigga head like a snap back
I'ma hit her with this wood, no mousetrap
Take a five-hour rest, ball it catnap

I just copped the coupe, it came with twin turbo
Diamonds 'round my neck, they singin' like they Kirko
Thugger got me swung, got drinkin' all this purple
And I got them billionaires in my circle
So you know I'm thinkin' 'bout coppin' a 'Rari
I got old money like when I played Atari
Counted me a million on my DVD
Coca, cocaina, I got recipes
Really makin' juggs, I was servin'
Cash Money nigga, I know Birdman
I just want the cheddar, I just want the pesos
Rich Gang, YSL, came up off that yayo

Got a 'Rari with the engine in the back
Every neighbor know a nigga servin' crack
Chasing cheese, but I cannot be a rat
Screamin' free Gucci Mane, no Mack
I just finished doin' business with the hat back

Bust at you niggas that pretend with the shit
A lot of niggas tryna blend with the crips
Make him break bread, kick in for the shit
Run him off cuz he been was a bitch
It's a big ass hood but it's a small ass clique
(Look), full of real niggas and we hate fakes
Round table, politicking on the late late
Can't run a nigga credit then he ain't straight
Gang of volunteer killers and they can't wait
I'm from where they cut holes in the gate
Take him to the back, and expose if he's fake
Point Blank, shoot a hole in his face
No weapon, no witness, that's the whole in this case
Look, county jail front line with a shank
S Gang, neighborhood in they face
Homies left got detained to the state
But I kept it that way in a whole different tank
Roll it up, you a whole different game
Rap money, that's a whole different bank
Niggas done so much dirt in LA
Got these niggas banging this in a whole different state
Look, look

AB bitch, I’m all bout them Benji’s
I come through there fresh like John Lennon
My wrist a Hellcat, I’m not kidding
They dig all the shit that I’m kicking

Wasn't gon’ turn your ass until you told it'
Wasn't gon’ ice your ass down ‘til you folded
Kick that bitch off the boat with no notice
Nigga jewelry water, need to float it
Make some bad bitches fuck my brodie
I eat crabs, fish, and that Chipotle
They got lots of bread, I’ma call Butta

Three chopsticks, I paid a stack for it
They run me through, I probably got warrants
In the back of the 'Bach, ugh
Burning OG out of Backwoods
Not just dancing, diamonds racing Balmain
Lots of fakes allergic to seafood and serve for decoration
Lobster never tasted
Missed Thanksgiving, I was in Miami
I was on ocean, I was on vacation
In the Benz speed, 120 racing
AB in a Rari, shit was like the Matrix
In and out of lanes, weaving in the spaceship
I’m flexing, got muscle like Popeye
But fight over a bitch, no that is not I
I’m him, I'm gon' tell the roof bye bye
Then remove the lid at the stoplight
With my side bitches at Benihana’s
Brung her sister, her bestie, her mama
Told ‘em tab is on me, yeah I got ‘em
And I pay the bill all in new hundreds

Like a motherfucking dad
And you know that we feastin’
I just couldn’t get fat
Mind fuck ‘em when I speak
Take the Farrakhan notes
My rock wrist is on gold
Like the new Audi spokes
Niggas scared to they soul
When I pull up with folks
I’ma take out the Trojans put it right in her throat
And you know I stay with them AKs and I should’ve caught ‘em
Mind fuck 'em, he shouldn't have played 'bout the butta
I only play inside the cover
Like a kid, make them play with each other

Diamonds black, I'm a walking night
Play with Thugger, scary sight
No shoestrings in these shoes, so I ain't tripping
I ain't worried bout shit, cause I got zippers on all of my shoes

My mind keep telling me no (telling me no)
My body keep saying I need it
Critics say I'm out of control (out of control)
Cause I'm abusing these drugs and I beat it
But my shoes tied so I ain't trippin
I ain't trippin, I ain't trippin (I ain't trippin ho)
I got lean and it's killing my kidneys
I got racks that I stack for my children
I ain't trippin, I ain't trippin, I ain't trippin
I ain't trippin, baby
My shoes tied so I ain't trippin, baby

I got three best friends, they tell me about all of my hoes
You wanna bool with me? Call them 500 on my clothes
We build our unity, I got them young nats calling me early like on truancy
They wanna get with me, make a flick with me
Thugger Thugger, baby, take her to Italy
I'm too up, I get the birds for like ten-a-piece
And therefore, I'm on the road I know she missing me
But I'mma leave early to take her ass to Tiffany's
Birds fly high, but you fly higher
You got a man, and I don't want to but I got to despise you
For dinner time, come heeere, come heeere

She was a friend of Thugger, now she a friend of Scotty

Baby I want your pizza, I want all the toppings
Baby I want your pizza, pizza, I want

My birth certificate say I'm so magnificent
School? Didn't attend it 'cause they think I'm so magnificent
Head bigger 'cause my bitch say she magnificent
Hundred percent I cashed out when I bought my Bentleys
I've been grinding since I came up off the porch
She want me to pull the string and see if I'm so important
Not a toy, baby girl, I got a little boy
Aye (Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo!)

I am magnificent, 
I'm cookin' chickens
, and my neck is red like a hen
I told that little bitch that she not gon' win, and I told her to go hit it in
Choppers gon' chop, and I swear to God I am a slime, I'ma shoot at your spin
Watches on watches got timing on timing, I just might bring Flava Flava in
Caught me a big ol' lil body, lil bitch, and you know it's the Benz
Suck on my dick, baby, suck on my dick 'til you got a big chin
Soon as I fuck on your ho, boy, you know I'm gon' make her back bend
Cookies, I roll it, I roll it, got fish scale, but I don't got baits
These little bitches know that I am the future plus I'm holdin' weight
I pulled up, hop out the 'Rarri, now they tailgating
I might keep my hands down, let my jewelry wave

Bling, bling, bling, I iced out my team
If you ain't sayin' that nice, my nigga, what the fuck you mean?

I like my bitch brown like sugar cane (Woah, woah, hey!)

Eat that pussy 'til I throw up
I got water out in Florida
Lil mama know I can't cuff her
Fuck cleaning, I'm a buffer
My diamonds black like a muffler
My bitch a gnat, and I trust her
Fuck nigga, you're pie, a custard
He got lames rhymes, no Busta
I'm like, ""Nigga, bitch, I'm too fly for this shit""
Got a lot of niggas on the block that'll do or die for this shit
Got a lot of bitches out in Follies that'll come around with my clique
Nutted on the bitch's panties, she told her old man it was spit
Baby lil girl you know YSL is the realest they get
Bitch I'm on fire, fire, the best fire like a Bic
I want to know where it's at, and I swear to God, I'ma go get it
Turned up my birds in my words, and now I'm 'bout fly as a pigeon
Hop in my coup, and I brrrp the ceiling
My bitch, she rich and black like Oprah Winfrey
5-4-3-2-1, there go both her pimps
I like white meat, baby, pass me a little sugar
Hey, thirty two on my hip
Woah, no hole but I'ma let it rip
Or you could throw it off of the ship

Hop out the bed
Gotta get back to the bread
Roll up and smoke on the kush
Pull up and fuck on your bitch

I got three best friends, they tell me 'bout all of my hoes
You wanna bool with me? Cause I give 'em a hundred to wash my clothes
We built off unity, I got them young nats callin' me early like I'm truancy
They wanna get with me, make a flick with me
Thugger Thugger, baby, take her to Italy
I'm too up, I get the birds for like ten-a-piece
And therefore, I'm on the road, I know she missin' me
But I'mma leave early to take her ass to Tiffany's
Birds fly high, but you fly higher
You got a man, and I don't want to but I got to despise you
For dinner time, come heeere, come heeere, woah woah

She was a friend of Thugger, now she a friend of Scotty

Hunnids on me, they thinner than a thong, baby
I feel like I'm on the moon way long, baby
Tell the bitch to take that like Diddy Kong, baby
Me and Quan like Jay and Ye', Watch the Throne, baby
Creepin' in that black truck just like the song say
Hey, and that car was from Malone, baby
She my ex just like Mill, oh, I'm gunning real
I told the boy I got a tip if it's dub seal
You been pussy, I see your whiskers 'bout as long as a seal
She look at me, I look by green like a Navy Seal
You cry, I swear to God, I'ma try fuck your tears

And that ass I got to have, I’m not grabbing, we can share it

But them M’s I can post those, and I’m smoking indoors outdoors
Give me good head, and I’m folding up the lead

And if you got some big titties say (Oh yeah)
And if your pussy stay itchy say (Yeah yeah)
Cause you shave it and crave it, I eat it when you bathe it

When you leave I wish that I could copy it and paste it

Check this out right, bein' broke, that's bad for my health, right?
I got so much of this shit, I signed myself
All I want you to do right now, I want you to talk to these folk
And tell 'em how I really live, right?
'Cause we havin' so much money right now...

And I'm Su Woo but I wrote this with a blue pen
And this the movement, please join in
And they like ""Thug really do this""
And I'm lucky to tell y'all this the blueprint
And I wonder why they hatin' on me
I guess the ice got they main bitches skatin' on me
Maybe my car 'cause the next year's datin's on it
TIP, I'm a young king, please put the cape on me
Thug go in, curfew
I'm on a lot of tracks, they say the Thug startin' to irk you
And y'all eatin' shit that's baby food, burp you
If Wayne flow is kush, then my shit is on purple
But my flow is sick, it's dyin', I need a donor
And I'm so great, when I leave I need a cloner
I didn't ride a wheel so that Phantom gon' need an owner
And your ho be totally screamin', she's not a moaner
I told Wayne I was ready for the paper like Usher
He said cool, sit back, stay away from busters
Now Thug got the big head, I am a gusher
I am not the best but I am better than others

And I know you believe in me
And I'm at the top, you shall achieve with me
And I'm not gonna stop so you'll succeed with me
I have your body frozen, your degrees with me
And I know you believe in me
And I know, you know, I know you'll succeed with me
And I know, you know, I know you'll achieve with me
I have your body frozen, nigga freeze with me

I'm at the tip top, ain't no toppin' me
I want the whole thing, now watch me re-rock a key
And I ain't wanna flex, so I called bee-bee
Sippin' on this mud got me bobbin' and leanin'
I hopped out the porch just like Skooly
Me and Young Thug on this one, it's a movie
Pull up in that drop, his mouth drop like droopy
Now they sayin' I got the big head like Stewie
I took a break from the rap for a reason
Now I ride drop head flyin' down Cleveland
Whoever thought me and my crew be ridin' horses
Panoramic car, that mean back to back Porsches
They said I fell off 'cause I ain't brought the new whip through
But when I bring it back, I'ma paint that bitch crip blue
And still post up on the ave with my boy big blue
And a hundred young niggas and they all screamin' Su Woo
I went to church just to chill in the pulpit
And Mario got shot, yea that's still some bullshit
But Thug, I can't let it handle you
I'ma take you off to Cleveland, aka the Zoo

And my bitch look like a barbie
I have a new spot, Houston no Marcus
Nigga you don't wanna start it
Lil Tee bring the troops, we the sergeants
Ride the beat like a ROC crew Harley
And if y'all ballin' with the bands we Spalding
Bet a couple M's and I'm all in
And I'm so high, in ten days I still be fallin'

And I know you believe in me
And I'm at the top, you shall achieve with me
And I'm not gonna stop so you'll succeed with me
I have your body frozen, your degrees with me
And I know you believe in me
And I know, you know, I know you'll succeed with me
And I know, you know, I know you'll achieve with me
I have your body frozen, nigga freeze with me

Yeah, and I'm the motherfuckin' realest
And any nigga hear about me they say Young the fuckin' illest
And y'all motherfuckers brainless, no ceilings
Bought the new Bentley coupe, the roof I had to fuckin' kill it
Bought my bitch the new Audi, we need to switch 'cause I like it
When I don't like to drive, we bought the jet so I can fly it
They say I'm sexy but the face look kinda mean so don't fright it
And niggas know I'm shootin', they say I don't, then they lyin'
And if they say they shot back they a front
The only niggas shot that was the runts
So shoutout to the runts
I'm the realest, no front
I'm sorry I had to kick it like a punt, yeah

And I know you believe in me
And I'm at the top, you will succeed with me
And I'm not gonna stop so you'll succeed with me

Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo

Let me stand up in that pussy like I'm on a ladder
Beat that thang up sideways, up, down and backwards
I just get that head and get ghost, they should call me Casper
I got that money on my mind, if it ain't 'bout money it don't matter
Real stand-up nigga, no comedy
Everywhere, these bitches see us, man, I swear that they runnin'
Too bossed up and I can't look back, I can't run out no money
And I give back to my hood and my homies passin' out hunnids

That's what we call paying homage
These niggas act like they want it
Pull up with choppers, we want it
Most of all the niggas I run with be wanted
Pull up, spray, I'm on north side, that's my condolence

Bring it to the Thugger, meet me on Gresham, new gold medal
These bitches ain't know who know better
My whole crew better, I treat 'em like they special
And that's because they is, cook fish scale with skill
And my weed kinda loud like a motherfuckin' pill
Ooh, I wanna spend my night with you
I want to spend my life with you
I want to ride my bike with you (Skrrrt)
I want a wife and girl it's you
I'll stand up for you like Moses
I do my best and yeah, she notice it
Said only got one face, ain't no emoji
I swear to god this ain't no bogus shit
Even though I'm hot, I got the coldest wrist
I made a million and she know about it
I showed my brother, little bitch, and he didn't know about it

Let me stand up in that pussy like I'm on a ladder

Thugga, I'm kill one of these suckers

Shoot a nigga dead then feed him to the gutter
Beat him, like a little bitch I treat him
It's on, on sight, like this I greet him
Pow! Talk that shit, nigga, now
Get your ass gunned down, nigga, this my town, I run it
Sucka nigga know he don't want it
Ain't nobody gon' keep me from walking up on it
Nigga love running 'round talkin' tough, don't he?
Pray to God, may I die, let 'em fly on my opponent
Hol' up, we will roll up, hop out of that Corolla
Spitting this AK outchea, at your chest until it blow up
Cuz, you are so done, absolutely no one
Can save you from the wrath I'm bringin' to yo' ass, I'm goin'
In on you and everyone you knowin'
I ride on you till no end, you ain't even gon' know when
I suffocate you, smother you, I ain't gon' leave you no wind
Everybody know you ain't got no win, cause I'm
Known to clown, hit the town, kick your door in
I'm lookin' at the hammer, barrel end at your end
Put dough in the back 'fore the thang start blowin'
The yop get goin', splatter your brains on the floor, I'm like

Pull up with them F&Ns comin' out the hatch
Pussy mothafucka scared to say it to my front

Point it at his liver, make the nigga reconsider

Bullet turn you into stop sign, huh
Swat a pussy nigga if he that fly
Light a nigga up, me no talk and beg
Crack a nigga up like the yolk out a egg
Smoke a nigga out like an ounce from a dread
These niggas straight pussy, ain't vouchin' for them
Ice cold nigga like a motherfuckin' gem
Branch out, nigga, like a motherfuckin' stem
Cut a nigga off, ain't tied up for them
Tell a bitch nigga I'm fire with the pen
Lay a nigga down, watch him die at the end
Four-five nigga, it's a nine, that's a ten
Pussy on my dick, you and I and my friend
Which one of ya'll wanna try this again?
Which one of ya'll wanna try me again?
Big body six, I'm high in the Benz
Flippin' the flow, on timin' again

I know all about her
I wanna put a eight-ball in her corner pocket

I just read her diary, went and bought her that Mercedes
No cop car, she a Taurus
Yeah, that ""T"", that mean she taken
She don't feel right 'til she play me
She won't take my bread, no baby
And just for that, I would love to keep her
She keep going 'round like an equator
I'll introduce her to paper
Bitch, it's a bando, it’s vacant
I bought ice just for my acres
Damn, there go a superstar, no shaker
Hey, I grab that pistol and erase 'em

Mama say I ain't have no choice but to do my mothafuckin' thing
Got my shoes, I tied 'em up and made a whole 'nother lane
My diamonds shining, they glistenin', but they ain't from Johnny fuckin' Dang
You say her cat was terrific and I said the same damn thing

You feel the same way 'bout it, you feel the same way
I swear I’ll catch me a body, these niggas try to play
You know I'm rich, but ain't make you the girl in the same day
You know I don't care about cheese on my head like Green Bay
No way, José (Yah)
You like my motherfuckin' fate today (Ohh)
I might catch her ‘round the way, stray and save the day
Put that dick inside her she stuck, she stuck like clay

Now she suck a nigga like woo
My new CD's are print, but it ain't blue
I got a K in my trench, it's 'specially for you
Gunning, watch them pop lock it and drop it
Got all five pockets full in case you think it's a wallet
Shoot em in the back like Ricky, no Bobby
I got hoes and they give me head without a pocket
Aye, eenie miny mo
I'ma fuck the bitch all of her clothes on
Nigga that complain really poor, uh
Need a new job better store up
Need a new car with some carbon
I don't make it rain no, I'ma nut on her car, let her snort some
I just went inside Nordstroms and spent me a motherfuckin' fortune

I'ma fly to LA, I been getting them racks
Tired of chasing that money, fuck her front and her back
I don't ever talk smack, pussy you ain't taking jack
I don't like cats, I like jags, I drink drank by the keg
I won't hit if it's stankin', suck that dick while you planking
I might buy new Acres, climb in it like a Wrangler
Substituting these whores
As I'm flying around the globe
I'ma shoot you boy if you play about my woah

You know where to keep your significant other, by your side
You know what to tell her to make her smile when she fold a frown
You know what to do to her truly happy
One touch can get her nasty, I got infinite love

Without second guessin', you know where to kiss a Blood
Without second guessin', you know where to kiss and rub
Without second guessin', you can make a nigga love (Yeah, yeah)
Wait, without second guessin', you know how to make me rush home
Followin' love, sometimes end up on a dead road
I'll drop my nuts about you girl, I turn to King Kong

Without second guessin', you know that I wanna love you
Without second guessin', you know I won't use no rubber
Without second guessin', you I go Rambo, load up ammo
Speed down the block, crash the Lambo

Then they'll never let me out the house, can't look at the sun

I never have fun, just sit here in the dark
Ashin' the blunt, I'm just bein' blunt, ayy

Hop out the G4, now I'm back to the basics
I thank God that I am not racist
Shout out to Wayne cause he is not basic
He got me on my turtle time, no Matrix
And I promise I'll ball, no patriot
And I'll be at the finish line, slick waiting
Which is at the tip top, big Akron
But if I fall off I'll die, so I'm pacin'
And I've been in and out the bank bitch
While ya'll assholes been in and out a tank bitch
I think I'm on my Wayne cake shit
But we smoke the same weed, the Wayne stank shit
And I'm the top tire, no innertube
And I'll eat till you're sour, like lemon food
Cause I'm the motherfuckin' boss and you're a middle dude
And you're just like the bricks, we get rid of you
And I should make a pledge of allegiance
Cause these niggas small, they ain't in my region
I stay away from ya'll when you niggas this bleedin'
Cause I don't know if you know me like I'm takin' the pleadin'
We in the buildin', the niggas that are outback
I throw the children at your bitch and she caught that
And I'm the boss so, yea I Marshall Faulk that
And my partner on my falkjack
I'm at the top, no lie
And I be in the motherfuckin' sky, don't fly
And if I can't stay around ya, I'mma run right through ya
But if you get right bitch, I might new, new ya

Yea, it's Thug, I have prison bars (Do the math)
Concrete jungle and shit
We been havin' this shit man
Long, long time ago, I promise you

Money on your head, now you need a paper proof roof
Niggas at me, man I need a bulletproof booth
And what ya'll call goons, we call goof troops
And them hoes we smashin', ya'll call 'em new, new
Ridin' with the 50 cal, old man protected
How the song got Universal still neglectin'?
Oops I mean select me
Skooly didn’t forget me
I fuck with Juugman shit, respect he get plenty
And I be with my dogs like a hunter
We be blowin' racks while they starvin' out for hunger
And they say I look good, but I'm mean, sexy monster
They wanna make me mad but Ty told me to stay humble
And they ask me why I still respect Jimfro
Cause he the motherfucker that made me, is you crazy?
And he asked me why I had two babies
Cause I ain't lettin' a fuck nigga clone me, is you crazy?
But if a nigga play with them babies
He gone need the motherfuckin' army and the navy
Cause the ROC crew move by the babies
And we got a 1000 guns in Haiti
And Skooly hopped out the Porsche
And I be ridin' round lurkin', me and your dad
Or should I be sayin' the zan man kids?
Cause we be high like the school at Harvard of Spanish, ya dig?

30 bands right below my waist
You can touch like a board, I ain't hit a sweepstakes though
After all them eats, better eat off my plate, pasos by the caseload
The big homie, he got you, Mexico with Maceo
Alright, I'm ridin' 'round town and put my hands down
If that's a nigga from your crew then put his hands down
Better watch his ass, better watch his ass
'Cause if you let this shit pass, your career ain't gon' last

My whole life, I liked to gang bang, ayy
Chief Keef a nigga, we bang bang, whoa
I love them, they love me, we tango
They help me stack these chips like Pringles
This weed I smoke's no joke, this drink I drink's no joke

Trunk of my car look like a Buddha
Catch ya bitch and recruit her
Brush ya hair for oodles and noodles

Got her titties down like she work at Hooters
Bangin' red like Freddie Krueger
'Bout to open the door for my shawty

Four  for the camera, fuck the narcs and agents
'Cause gettin' this paper is so contagious
I'm gon' work this bitch until they serve them work paper

Ain’t nobody supposed to have it, I snatched it
I gave 'em mostly green like a salad, not average

And I'm like, ""Yeah you the best and that's a bet"" (That's a bet)
I wanna go with you, you G fresh
She leavin' him for me like so what?

My heart lover, but see that ain't what my pain say
You had my heart in your pocket like a device, girl
You didn’t tell me shit was good, I can't deny it girl
But you didn't never know lil’ shawty wouldn't bite
You didn't tell me this was clear, it would be right
You ever had the chance to figure out your life, baby, yeah
Came a long way from a Metro
Now it's Comme des Garçons, bosses on my leg, woah
I'll pin a bitch up, on the bed board, okay
All my life I ran from the cops

I never had to go to the block

Just a bad ass nigga,  and never ever thought to stop
Dot my I's and cross my T’s
Let my show sell out at night
’Cause I got haters and opps, so I don't be posting flyers
I know hatred ain’t that nice
Know a couple fraud bitches, marry niggas overnight
Put a bitch on 'em, divorce him, then get half of his life
Bitches plottin' on an abortion, trying to fuck you every night
Keep that pussy good as squeegee, and it's juicy, and it’s tight
Just an insecure bitch, ain't got insurance on your life

And I rock cash mill rich nigga shit, I eat calamari

I'm a coach, I keep a red flag
2012 cat, Big copped the red Jag
And I be in the coochie with Lil' Mikey and Big Smash
And I promise you can't stare at my jewelry, it's like a flash
You square like a graduation cap
And I guess I'm on a Six Flags' ride, cause I'm strapped
And the house is very large, you can spot it on the map
And the racks so very big, so we keep 'em in the knap-
Sack, I am not wack
Please bring it back like I sent you to go get it
But don't come quickly like I sent you 'round the city
And if a nigga play he get beats, Nitti
Ugh

And I've been thinking about a whole lot of money
Which is the opposite of what you thinking, which is a whole lot of nothing
And y'all niggas doing a whole lot of fronting
But when I'm gunning, man, you know I do a whole lot of bunning

And y'all still written, we steady buying, bitch
And I bought a hundred watches, can't waste my time, bitch
Girl, you ain't a dime, bitch
You can't get a dime, bitch
Get off of my line, bitch
But it'd be a crime, bitch
Yup, I will have your mommy crying, bitch
And she be acting like a fan, so I hit her with an iron, bitch

And I've been rapping a whole lot of dummies
No friends selling, but I've been serving a whole lot of dummies
You can call me fan, cause I'm blowing a whole lot of money
And your jewelry is cheesy, you got on a whole lot of sunny

Kidnap your baby

I ball hard, and I ball smart
Which means I flood the club, lifeguard
You gon' need a lifeguard, cause I'm at your throat, ho
And you need an extra band, can't rob me solo
I'm smoking indo, I will leave you outdoors

Then I picked him up and chopped him up, hello, hogs

Ball On Y’all,I Came from Nothing,2011.0,"Hey, I'm a product, you can order me
It's Audemars, Gucci, and Louie V
Them hoes used to throw up, now them bitches swallow
I used to drink shots, now it's out the bottle

I remember when I used to call on y'all
Now get out of line, and I'll call on y'all (Okay)
If I ever fall, I'll fall on y'all (War)
It's like referees with us, how we ball on y'all

I bossed up on 'em when I copped the coupe
And opened up their eyes when I dropped the roof
I ain't Rick Ross, but I'm a fuckin' boss
I told her she could ride if she gave me mouth
But she gotta hurry up, cause we headed South
And she gotta do Thug if I switch the route
They say I'm bougie 'cause I travel with my Louis bag
But when I reach, I take my Gucci out my Louis bag
New boss, y'all out, vetoed
I'm transferrin' money from my evo
New house, so I'm lookin' through the peephole
'Cause ain't nothin' s'posed to be here but the kilo

I remember when I used to call on y'all
Now get out of line, and I'll call on y'all
If I ever fall, I'll fall on y'all
It's like referees with us, how we ball on y'all

No homo, but we balls on y'all
I fell to the sky, call it a skyfall
No, we do not fall, we are not y'all
We go the hardest, ROC crew smartest
New condo, I can see Madison's garden
And I'm in the 4 with the green, no Rick Marvin
Now I got to work for the fiends, no more starvin'
No more starvin, Marvin
I'm ridin' this beat like it's taking me to a million
They gonna take me to prison, 'cause I made a killin'
10 racks on me, my whole money, no written
And if you try to take it, you'll be left with no ceilings
Shoot him in the chest several times, that's no feelings
Shoot the fuckboy from the upstairs, still no feelings
If he fuck up with the money, no more dealings
Still fuck with white boy, shouts out to Willie
Your bitch in the condo suckin' on all us (all us)
She'll be suckin' on all us
She's an anteater, she's just suckin' on all us
(And what if we skeet?)
So just swallow this dick

I remember when I used to call on y'all
Now get out of line, and I'll call on y'all
If I ever fall, I'll fall on y'all (Capo)
It's like referees with us, how we ball on y'all

Okay, now hundred thousand dollars in a rubber band
And fuck them haters, they ain't shit, 'cause they ain't got a plan
I got a vision for the paper, y'all just think I'm playin'
Life bigger than what you see but y'all ain't even carin'

I remember when I used to call on y'all (Okay)
Now get out of line, and I'll call on y'all (Let's go)
If I ever fall, I'll fall on y'all (Okay)
It's like referees with us, how we ball on y'all

Straight off the top, I can name niggas that really bitches
But Corey got the beat runnin', so no time for snitches
Now that I'm on, I can get you all off like light switches
Now I ain't switchin', I'm just tellin' you how it is
Most of my niggas died, but they never got to live
I do this shit for us, let's go

And I remember when I used to call on y'all
Now get out of line, and I'll call on y'all
If I ever fall, I'll fall on y'all
It's like referees with us, how we ball on y'all

And I remember when I used to call on y'all
Now get out of line, and I call on y'all
I ever fall, I fall on y'all
I'm so straight, I'm gonna fall on y'all
Too straight, I'm gonna fall on y'all
I'm so straight, I'm gonna fall on y'all
I remember when I used to call on y'all

We gon catch him in these streets
Bust his cerebellum
Looking for him like the police
With my umbrella, when I hop up out the phantom
I bang watermelon, that’s the color bandana
Molly got me rollin', I can see all of these plotting niggas
I’m like the president, niggas they want to bury me
Bitches they want to rape the kid
I’m fly like pelican, all of these bitches wait for bids
I’m sick and tired of the critinitics
All the critics want to bite into my dip sum
I ain’t playing, I’m for real for some
King cobra nigga killing off
Too many, too pretty, these the city bitches
All these pussy niggas riding dick without permission
All these critics tryna kill me but its benefit me
SMM nigga that’s my shit, get it?
That’s my shit, get it
Get it

All these chains that I have on
So many foreign bitches in my phone
I'ma pull outside with purple

It’ll hurt your eyes, it’ll hurt your eyes
It’ll hurt your eyes, it’ll hurt your eyes
It’ll hurt your eyes, it’ll hurt your eyes
It’ll hurt your eyes, it’ll hurt your eyes

On the phone with bloody, listening to the chain gang
When I was young I used to wonder how it feels to gang bang
Now that I bang it feel like my phone don’t ever stop ringing
Play with big B’s and that funeral ain’t gon never stop singing, nigga
Nigga riding round with Glock 40s
No lady, but we riding round, looking for shorty
Pistol old, but you know them bitches only 30
I been busting since I was 12, my scrap ain’t no virgin
Young niggas, climbing up the fucking ladder
We gon reach you, push a nigga like you came out of battle
Hundred shots hit him, fold him up like a centipede
DK a J, he like to smoke a nigga, no weed
Baow, baow, baow, baow
Man down, get him
Baow, baow, baow, baow
These these fucking missiles
Nigga playing with the squad, we coming too hard
We coming to hard, better play the squad

All these chains that I have on
So many foreign bitches in my phone

My Life,I Came from Nothing 3,2012.0,"Now listen brah, for years I was runnin from the law
Believe the shit that I saw
Woke up everyday, wanted more
Shit that I done did, if I could I do it all again
That shit made me who I'm am
That shit got me all these mils
All these days I was starvin', back touchin' my stomach
Daydreamin', wonderin', how I'mma get me some money
Slipped ten toes in that trap, finessed niggas out sacks
I did shit that I ain't proud of, still I wouldn't take it back
Nowadays I take my thoughts, then I'm down like a wrestler
Work hard like a slave but live better than the master
And what we do it wrong, why it feel so right?
Thank God everyday, I don't know how I'm still alive
My life, my life, I earned my stripes
My life, my life, I grew up trife
Been gettin' money since a young nigga
Streets labeled me the Dun dealer

My life, my life, my life
My life, my life, my life
My life, my life, my life
My life, my life, my life
My life, my life, my life

King slime, triple cross king
Trunk full of Yao Ming
Crocodile long (?), alligator on my feet
I stretch the work out, like an athlete
My shooter air it out, watch a track meet
I turn ya'll niggas to meat
I used to rap the things in the inner-tube
Now I kick this rich nigga shit on pro tools
My life I done sold them bricks
My life I done hit them licks
My life is so high risk
And I'm prayin' for Bloody Jay
Because that nigga wild with that AK
And ask Thug, and ask Slug
My shooter got a shooter nigga
Rock put me on this rap shit
So he took me out that trap shit


Me and my ho were arguin'
Money was lookin' funny
She was like you trippin' baby
You know I wouldn't do nothin' brazy
So I sat down and thought about how long ago I caught them caps
Now my homie done think I'm trippin' cause my money surrounded by traps, oh
I got mice bitin' through my shit
And ya my diamonds are so white
It looks like lights off in my shit
And I be high as a son of a bitch
So ya my flight just might be risk
And she vibin' to this shit
She know I'll eat her alive
And my weed strong
You can fart by me
And when you smell it
Let Young Thugger tell it
Couple bands on my feet
Walk through the door and duck like Yao Ming
I'm a motherfuckin' army man cause all I want is green
My life I been in them traps
My life I (?) that scrap
My life I done took niggas life
My life you wouldn't get by
I'm with my big homie Jay and my big homie Rock
Instead of them big homie stocks
And we pull big homie guap",https://genius.com/Young-thug-my-life-lyrics

I'ma crush me a Xan with a upper pill, ooh
Don't need to ask, this jewelry real, ooh

Take the money off the dance floor, head right to a ho
Take the top off the Bentley, leave it at the store
Hunnid racks in twenties, fifties and hundreds, eeny-miny-moe
At the intercontinental with my Alabama folks
Got the coupe over 6-4, a hunnid thousand spokes
Ridin'd 'round kickin' kick doors and rockin' nigga 
I don't ever wanna kiss, not one of y'all hoes
Any one of y'all niggas play, y'all gon' die slow, yeah
I hope you hate me, I'ma do you shady
Don't ever save me, no

This Is My Life,"Greatest Hits, Vol. 1",UnKnown,"Young Thug getting back?
And the chopper super long

Baby, this is my life
Young Thug balling
Stack the money up, and it spend all at the mall and
Baby, this is my life
The whole crew eating
Bricks came Monday and they gone by the weekend
Baby, this is my life
I done wrote a lot of track
,they be like ""Appreciate you, Young Thug""
And every time we about to leave
They be like ""Come back to my club""
I had a show up in LA, them niggas swore I was the plug
I'm sipping on some syrup, man I think that I'm in love

Damn, and every time I thought about quitting
It felt crazy to the Thug, like something was missing
I had to sneak and do my thing, cause I didn't have permission
Now I'm in your back yard lurkin, pre-mission
I told them keep it 200, I blast for it
But he still keeping it 100, like his dashboard
The we ain't had nothing for credit, only cash for it
And if he sweet, rob him without a mask for it
And fuck you, I can decide myself
And don't mention racks, cause I provide myself
I'm standing next to the best so I'm beside myself
And The flow sick, but the chopper guide myself

Baby, this is my life
Young Thug balling
Stack the money up, and it spend all at the mall and
Baby, this is my life

I had a show up in LA, them niggas swore I was the plug
I'm sipping on some syrup, man I think that I'm in love

And they be like ""Thug, where the fuck you go?""
I am way up here
Big fat racks in front of me like a chauffeur
And my son scared of me, he say ""The mink look like a bear""
So that's why everywhere I go, women just look and stare
But my car is not rare
Meaning I pay double and the ring cost a couple
And I am not weak, but the Ferrari doesn't struggle
And I guess I'm a baller, because the Feds say I double
And I am such a winner, oops, my fault, I'm still winning
And you such a beginner, oops, my fault, you still beginning
And I get money on my own, while you steady depending
Believe me, I am not kidding

I had a show up in LA, them niggas swore I was the plug
I'm sipping on some syrup, man I think that I'm in love

I stack 50s and 100s because I like them
They don't want to lick him no more, they trying to bite him
I'm 18, day grown women, they trying to mic him
Plus the fellas mad, they angry, they think they fright him
Plus I made them think that I'm broke, I had to psych them
I went and caught the Super Bowl ring, I tried to light them
I blew the bubble kush in their face, I tried to kite them
When I left the club with they bitch, I goodnight them

Baby, this is my life

Bank account just hit a million miles, diamonds and pearls
If she worth it, stuff her with twins, boys and lil' girls
She just wanna drank out her kidneys until she hurl

Give me more lights, lil' girl
Give me more lights, give me more lights, lil' girl
Give me more lights, before you fuck 'round and hurl

Yeah, your partner them get rolled too
I was taught to get that stick and go and bleed on them
Nigga came straight from the bottom now I got m&ms
And these niggas don't want no smoke, I see police in them, dog
And all my life I'm 'posed to show you and show you

Pockets stretched out like I got a barrel on me
I'm so Pluto, out of reach, can't come close to me
YSL, Bleaveland Ave, boy I bleed with them
Gun smoke in the air, blow that heat with them
All my life, I been a hustler and I showed you (and I showed you)
I got 10 whips outside and they showed you (ha, ha, ha)
I put a Rover in the pot and took it global (ha, ha, ha)
I get a whip imported out, come fully loaded (I'm so loaded)
I got some money, bought medallions
That bitch so bad, we call her stallion
Gotta put more zips inside the styrofoam
Fucked up your budget on one stone
You get so rich, they try to treat you like a outsider
I ran it up, they try to find a way to criticize it
Selling dope and juugin taking I ain't forgot about it
I became a legend in the streets there ain't no spit around me

The glacier on my finger cost me ten keys, Alicia
Dogs got the pet store boomin'
Baby, don't you move, I'll invest in your moves
Baby, watch me move, watch me Michael Jackson move
Billy Jean move, Bill Jean truth
Pocket rock inside of me
I just wanna know the money talk, Charlie Sheen
I just noticed all the bad bitches followin' (I noticed)
With a clear rearview, I see a lotta niggas followin' me
I see a lotta niggas broke, also loud as me
I see a lotta niggas try, but don't stick out like me
And if the monkey niggas died, you can't compare with me

Hundred miles an hour, you control the coupe
Thank you for giving me these golds, no flute
Please make 'em understand that I ain't no fruit
Please make 'em understand I only fuck coochie
Please forgive me for my sins
Please, please, please forgive me
All I wanna do is win
I don't write so I don't want the pen
I promise I'm in love with my kids

Lord knows that I take care of my kin
I promise I hope it never ends

To My Crips (RIP Nipsey & Troup)*,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Lyrics from Snippet

..nigga
This shit came a long way from Tommy Hilfiger (A long way)
I'm rich, the after life, I try to tell y'all (Yeah, yeah)
 I got it tatted on my sweater, ayy
Kemosabe, baby, I'm just tryna tell ya (No cap)
99 bitches, no problems, Hugh Hefner
I'm a party boy, outrageous (Ooh)
And I think my favorite girl be skippin' class (Ooh)
Introduce her to Barbie world, she just shop for bags (Ooh)
She just wanna keep me smilin', never leave me mad (Ooh)
I jumped the gate 'cause I was tryna throw the brick
I can't get caught with it  (Yeah, yeah)
I jumped in woods 'cause I had to throw the stick
'Cause this camouflage green and they won't find it (They won't find it)
Lowlife nigga, we just stack and get the gold (Lowlife)
I don't wanna hurt no one (Hurt)
Inglewood bloods with my right now
Boy, you better pipe down
We sleep in the lobby
AK for these pussy niggas thinkin' they got stamina
Tell me that ain't Nipsey I just seen on that camera
I can't visit no sight, fuck a candle
I can't see him in a casket like my grandpa
I can't see how niggas let him get shot
Doubled back, then ran up on him and nobody but him died
Tried to give a nigga benefits, but really, I cannot
And I can only imagine the tears on his momma's and his wife's eyes
That his face on the kid's shirt, they don't even know why
I'm like ""Oh my""
Oh my God, oh my God
Troup couldn't even see, the shit was blindsided
Nipsey couldn't even see, the shit was blindsided
Left a real nigga caressin' on a thotty now
Rich nigga, rich presence in his momma eyes
Big homie in all of his partner eyes
Double back, triple...",https://genius.com/Young-thug-to-my-crips-rip-nipsey-and-troup-lyrics

Early morning cries with the guys
Laughing about us ducking homicides
They say what makes you laugh, it'll also make you cry
They say what let you live, it'll also let you die
I travel with the stick 'cause I've seen murder in my eyes
Devil hunting on me while a nigga tryna strive
I had ran it up and then I helped him with his trial
He been going 11 and I still take care of his child

Money on my head
Stay at home 'cause there's money on my head
We don't talk, but I just know that you my man
Nigga play with you, 'gon leave em where he stand (Yeah)

She ain't trying her nose baby
She ain't trying to settle down, she'd rather run around

Got me wondering how he is in paradise

Got me taking shrooms every night up in my bed
Rather keep it cool with the niggas

We smilin', we wildin'
And we smokin' (?)
And I thought it was all fun and games
Until my girlfriend hit my phone and said whose drivin'
And I was like hold up
Tried to pour my cup up then she knocked it over
Then I almost threw up then she said I told ya
Then I thought I was from New Orlean when she said I know ya
Get it?

Reddit AMA,UnKnown,2012.0,"Q: Within 30 seconds of you rapping how often do you mention bitches, clubs, expensive cars and booze?
A: nothing in the first 30 seconds, everyone knows you want to wait until the 45 second mark..dick. And I've never mentioned an expensive car in anything, for what it's worth. No, valid question. I make a product for a certain audience and I'm good at it. Supply and demand, simple economics. I don't do this because I love the attention, I do this because I have a certain skill set that now allows me to get paid without the threat of doing federal time
Q: Remember don't sign with Turtle, he'll only get the white record labels to sign you
A: Haha, I just saw that episode. Saigon played himself out in that role
Q: What's your view on music piracy?
A: Piracy is good for underground artists, thanks to google people search the fuck out of songs to find the original artist. You end up getting more exposure as a indie artist. At this point I'm just happy my music is getting out. My management hate the shit though and now that music is the product they see piracy as money out of our pockets. I focus on music, I let them stress legalities and royolaties
Q: How did you first release your music into the public sphere? How did you start to generate publicity for yourself? What advice would you give to people who are trying to pursue this same dream?
A: I just started doing a shit ton of collabos with other artist that already had established followings
A strong and constant internet presence, a street team out promoting shows and appearances, You have to have a team you trust, people that know their talents and understand your vision and your goals, people who let you focus on your talent, believe in you, and will call you on your bullshit in a minute
Q: How old are you and what crimes have you committed?
A: 19, I sold weed and pills until a year ago",https://genius.com/Young-thug-reddit-ama-lyrics

Never Made Love (Demo),UnKnown,UnKnown,"Me and her had never made love 'til I fucked her
Lil’ lil' mama never fell for it 'til I bust her
And you a pretty, pretty girl, no cover
Fuck you with no rubber
Since your family don’t like me I'll let shots go at your brother
And your body look like gold when we fuck in Versace covers
Just because that pussy good, that don't mean that I'ma trust you
That crazy bitch stalkin' my brother Thugger

She caught me creepin' with my old ho
She ran up like ""yeah, yeah,"" I was like ""no, no""
My lookout man was my right hand but he was wrong though
Then I seen some diamonds come off of my neighbor's porch
And it was her, she had a Louis Vuitton purse clean as detergent
She had the same exact face as my brother's nurse
And he in a hearse, I never looked at it for what it’s worth

So I never made love, never made love (Ayy)
Never made love, never made love (Ayy)
Never made love, never made love
Never made love, never made love (Never made)
Never made love, never made love
Never made love, never ever ever ever made love
Never made love, never made love
I ain’t never made love (Ayy)

Never made love, never made love (Ayy)
When she open up, I'ma taste her (Try)
X out everyone and then erase her (Ayy)
I’m sorry for lyin' to your face, yeah (Sorry)
I'ma marry her and I bouquet her (Ayy)
Leavin' out the house drunk and she stumbles (Woah)
Be all on her mind, she can’t even think of (Drunk)
She walkin' off, I look at her like cable (Ayy)
Boolin' with your partners at a party, ayy (Fuckin' round)
They don't even know what the fuck love means, ayy (They gon' fuck with me)
She say she never waste time on me (Ahh)
Yeah that came out of your jaws, baby (I heard it)
I heard it, even though I suck it 'til she lockin' up (Ayy)
Lockin' up like handcuffs
Give me all your time, every day (Woo)
Girl how come we never made love at your spot? (Why?)
Cause you ain't want your other rich homie be findin' out (Ayy)
She want it so I spent 12 thousand on a lil' rug (Racks)
I'm just tryna tell you, ain't tryna make you look low

Even though you've never made love, never made love (Ayy)
Never made love, never made love, never made love (Ayy)
She never made love, never made love (Ayy)
Never made love, never ever ever (Never made love, ayy)
She never made love, never made love
Never made love
Never made love, never made love
Never made
Never felt love, never felt love
Never made love, never made love, never made love

Well I'ma change that there
I just might wake up and buy you everything rare (Woo)
I'm not cheatin' on you no more, I don't care (Swear to God)
You wanna be with me, I'ma roll the dice now (Roll it)
Roll it, I buy a Rollie, I'ma buy that bitch a Rollie (Roll it)
That pack keep rollin', I'ma buy that bitch some more shit
'Cause I fucked her sister then I fucked on all her cousins
Bitch I'm a Blood, you know I fucked on your bousins
She smiling in your face, but tellin' me she love it (Ayy)
She like the way my pants don't sag even though they're stuffy (Racks)
She won't T.I. on me, she don't care 'bout no money (Sorry)
Hey, hey (Swear to God)
Wait, wait, don't leave (Ayy)
Hey, hey (Swear to God, baby)
Ayy, ayy, hey (I love you like , baby)

They trip out all the time, tellin' you I'm on some bullshit
Parallel parkin' that pussy, they like my motion (Skrt)
Put that on my mama, now Stunna know that I'm loaded (Loaded)
When my partner see it he stand up like he on Folgers (Woo)
I ain't like that shit so I hit him right in his shit
Then I told him, ""don't ever do that shit there again"" (What?)
How you feel if I see your ho and fuck on the kid? (What?)
I'ma catch a body if she leave me, I'm not playin'
Yes, I said I'm the best and I put that on the red
When you make me mad I tried to get back and get some head
And I know that's wrong, but my dumb ass still did it instead
Then I put the strap to my own head like boy I'm on one, woah
Then I told her don't ever do it again (Uh huh)
Every guy you look at, I'll turn him to wind (Ayy)
Yeah, then I looked up at God like yeah

Then I realized I'd never made love, never made love (Woo)
Never made love, never made love
Never made love, never made love

Reel them ducks in, we call it going fishing
Washing machine all that money, we call it cleaning dishes
Making birds take a bath, we call it shaving pigeons
And I ain’t PeeWee Longway but your ho know I’m dealing
I’m cold hearted, I don’t got no feelings
In that new drop top, I don’t got no ceilings
The roof is absent, ball like I got cancer

I’m about to make her ride it like a rollercoaster
Get on top like rollercoaster
I make her get on top like roller, coaster, roller, coaster

They think it's woman inside of me
'Cause the way I wear my tees and my jeans
But I told em
Little do they know they women
Trynna lay down with meeeeee
And I said, I said
I just seen why (?) from the bottom to the top
I can see the arguments won’t stop, I can’t teach no bitch

I don’t know who you are for sure, but I want plenty more
I’ll lick your camel toe, I ain't taking no chance with you
Kid lock on the passenger door, kid lock on the passenger door
Say you love me
We so in love (?) how much we love each other
Never made love but we fucked in the tub and we rubbed each other
Can’t be changing up on your partner, the bitch you lovin lovin
We met at Coachella, now I got my cheddar up
I hop on the jet, we overspace
2012 my whole closet was filled out with jeans (?)
I’d like to feel on her, I took your bitch and im bout to feel on her
80’s music, sexual heal on it
Actavisis, I popped a seal on it
Knocked it out the park, I’m bout to steal on it
Everybody around me wanna fuck you
Show you right (?)
Smashin' on sight, slow stroke, left to right
Slow slow, left to right
Dream about the girls some nights
V12 gas I never hit a button
Doors go up on the new tesla
Everyone with me got extras
Put your headphones on, I’m bout to go head, tell you
Play with me, they popping your melon
Come with me, we fly off like a feather
Let’s go outta here

Little do they know they women

It's the coupe, but it's big like a hearse

Hold my cup tight
Bitch, just watch your step
And my diamonds the best like I picked 'em by myself
