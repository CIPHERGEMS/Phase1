Only thing she save me under is probably that ""U"" letter (Hello?)
No, I don't got provolone
Only thing in my pocket is probably, um, some blue cheddar
She tried to leave me alone
Then she got right with my clone, man, I hope that she do better
I know it's blue cheese on me
But when I got fifties on me, I call that shit loose cheddar (Hah)

If you got options I got options, baby, who you?

Three-hundred thousand, yeah, that's your money
Twenty more million, that's tour money
If you fuck me good, that's your money (Woah)

I got one girl from Philly, I think her name Nicki
And I fuck with Nicki 'cause she not too picky
And she not too choosy but sometimes she bougie
I play with her kitty until it get sticky
I'm movin' the bitch just like an alien
Chop with a fifty, my Uzi Israeli
See, I turned to the boss, can't deal with no middleman
Anthony Davis, don't deal with the Pelicans
Straight out the mud, we got that work that turn you to the Grudge
Leave you slime like a snail, you get hit with these slugs
I say how I feel and I do what I want
And not just because it is what it was
I'm high like a bird, man, but don't got no Lugz
Know you heard what I said, got this shit out the mud
I'm not in these streets, I'm just close with the plug
I just saw his mother, I gave her a hug

I just bought the Maybach, yeah
And that shit all matte black, yeah (All matte black)
I just bought the Maybach, yeah

No, I'm not sweet, I just got flavor
Don't need no to water to mix up this juice
They say ""Why your chain it look like a choker?""
That's for the slaves that had to wear the noose
Uh, no, you can't cuff me, baby, let me loose
The way that I live, baby, that's a roof
Matchin' closet, it came with a pool
Bro moving 8 balls, not no pool
If you ask me his name then I don't have a clue (Woah)
Make 'em hit the folks every time that I shoot
Too much money, I'm evil from the root
Yeah, my shows they bust right through the roof

I just want all of my niggas to ball
I just want all of my niggas to see
All the shit that I might not get to see
I just want all of my niggas to eat
I might just pull out that lean, that's a four
I might just jump in a 'Rari with two doors
I might just pull up and fuck on two hoes
I might just pull up and stunt like a boss

Ridin' round in a old school, with 2 hoes and just little old me
Fuck I'ma do wit this money
But walk in the club and start stuntin'
Push all my old bitches buttons
Came up from nothin' to something
Tell her take the stick, don't run from me
There's some for you, there's some for me

You can bring your friend I don’t wanna cuddle
If she from motor ball then her friend scoop it up then its right back to the huddle
So many hoes it look like an army, they march to my dick like hut two
And rifle with knife on the end of it so when I run out of bullets I cut you
She ask me my name and I said they call me Vert
Double Cup full of mud mouth full of dirt

I can not fuck with a bitch
If she ain’t fuckin' the clique, if she ain't sucking a dick
After I'm done Vert be ducking her quick
Working the back with the fifth
Ain’t got the cash, I ain't fronting you shit
Drinking on lean I ain't puffing a spliff
Watch getting loose cause I'm flexing the wrist
And you on the phone while I’m texting the bitch
And I be blessing a bitch when she licking the tip
And you be kissing that bitch like, Uzi ain’t nut on her lips
I be a dog, every bitch know I'm a pimp
Minus the ring and the cane and the limp

And I called your phone a hundred times before I even came to this conclusion
And you think I don't understand, but
I'm on a whole 'nother level, you the one that really don't understand
Nothing that I got going on

I don't have time for none of these games
Don't understand why you wanna keep playing
I got lots of war wounds and a lot of stains
And in my three years, a whole lot done changed
And in these three years, a whole of pain
I looked at my shirt, had a whole lot of stains
They tried to jack me, don't know where it came
Dracula niggas tryna usе they fangs
In my three years, met a wholе lotta lames
I met some good people, forgot all they names
And my girl like a Backwood that come with the veins
I don't really want it but I can't explain
I go to the back of this girl and I can't lose my pace
Vibration always be breaking the vase
She unbuckle my BB like I'm Lil Wayne
Her bandana tied just to keep her hair laid
And my bandana tied 'cause you know what I bang
Bandana santana, I can't feel my face
I close my eyes, close my hands, pardon my face
But you know Uzi not talking T. D. Jakes
I told the jeweler don't flood out the face (At all)
Factory time when I look at the date
Okay, you gotta go, gotta get out my place
No, I don't save, I don't save, got no cape

That girl, she lied just straight to my face
In twenty-two hours I finished the case
No, don't switch up, better stay in your lane
She took a sword right through my heart, penetrate
I'm the one that deserve a new upgrade
If I don't get it, I'm all on my own
I took her to dinner, want shrimp with no steak
I couldn't find it, they call them shits prawns
Only vane vines I knew you too long
Now what is the problem? Girl, what is you on?
Made her fall in love with the scent on my cologne
On the flights, you keep calling, it's different time-zones
Yes, my buzz got ginormous and this girl I know
I do not know what's right, don't know what's wrong
And I got her wet, I need to get a boat
That's with my voice when I'm laying these songs
And I came too strong (Too strong, strong)
And I came too strong (Strong, strong, I did)
And I came too strong (Next time I know), yeah

GG (Intro),"Purple Thoughtz EP, Vol. 1",2014.0,"Where other people stop, I accelerate
People say they're gonna do shit and they don't do it
I'm going all the way with it
The ultimate rock and roll sacrifice is death
When I die I don't die, my soul goes on
It's another invention
A bottle of death is exciting
Why do I wanna get old and be nothing?
Why do I want to be a poor human being?
I wanna do what I wanna do
And get everything done as quick as I gotta do it
And get the fuck out of there, go on
And then I can accelerate into the next life
And still leave my blood here
To be the blood of rock and roll and still be here
I'll never go away
But when I'm dead I will become stronger on Earth
And I'll become more powerful in the next life
There is no death
If I kill myself that doesn't solve the mission at all
The mission goes on and on and on
And people are so fucking stupid they don't understand that
They don't understand
They think ""Yo, okay, you're gonna kill yourself, well that's stupid"" Well you're fucking wrong
You're stupid for getting fucking old and boring and ignorant
Just like people on the jury that convicted me
I don't wanna be like you
I don't wanna be part of your fucking boring world
I wanna do what I wanna do
When I wanna end my life I'm gonna fucking end it
And I'm gonna be more powerful for it
And, and, all you people who say what I'm doing is wrong
You're just so fucking insecure
That you don't have the fucking balls to do it
You wanna say you're bad
But you don't really wanna fucking be bad
You just wanna pretend you are
Well I'm really gonna fucking do it
And that's what separates the real rock and roll underground
From the people who wanna just be pretend
You know bands
They come along and follow what I do and imitate what I do
I'm not just—",https://genius.com/Lil-uzi-vert-gg-intro-lyrics

And you talk about juugin', but you really trap
Got nicks and dimes money barely stacked
And a bitch I fucked over nigga barely tapped

Who woulda thought that they knew me
'Cause they run me down like Boosie
Nigga havin' dreams he could do me

So they don't like the way I do it, and they hate that I'm on top

Lonesome,UnKnown,2020.0,"There's some times when I get lonely, I get lonely
There's some times that I get lonely, I get lonely
When I take my time, know I always end it with the motions
When she calls my line, you know I am mourning, I am mourning

See the light, hide and seek
See the light in ivory
Over  carry nights and pain inside in silently
Unable to speak on the way in which she required me
Choking on the smoke, it was the pain inside is firing
See thе light, hide and seek
See the light in ivory
Over  carry nights and pain insidе in silently
Unable to speak on the way in which she required me
Choking on the smoke, it was the pain inside is firing

Silence, baby I am tired of your requirements (Shh)
Choking off a lot of smoke because I got a lot of stress
She gave me that dome and she need some time to find her neck
Money off retirement remind you of your father's check
Now come on baby, follow directions, I call that Simon says
So X-rated we always hit the floor, can never find the bed
Let’s go baby, let’s do it some more till I’m out of breath
Yes I hate it you’re not here at all, and you don’t exist
I be gone by the midnight
I be gone when it’s midnight
In the Audi R8 running red lights
You don’t really have to say what you really like
You don’t really have to talk you don’t have to lie
All your negativity messing up my vibe
And she know that I’m a beast got that appetite
I don’t want your girl gotta deal with mine
But I’m known to put her on the side
Prophecy they know that that’s a lie
20 years that’s 20 times 20 eyes
Watching me these boys want me to die
I just brung an FN on a G5
Making hits and I'm busting off the meter
That'll show you that I really don't need her

I see the light, now I see, what she is requiring
Waiting for a leader so I show her the entire me
Running through the wild we arrive at home entirely
Running from exactly what we are, the empire me
I know you need me baby, I know you need me baby
I promise I'll be right back right after this message baby
You and I could tell them all together in a letter, oh
Better we can just tell them the truth, it's that I know I can't stop

Now you see, when she calling me, yeah she fine as me, why I'm fine as hell
Where you finding her where honestly somewhere overseas, thats international
That's your bro you know his cash is low I seen the inside green, outside pistachio
If they can match the flow and they can match the dough, it's something like a myth because the chance is low
Me in one big room, I'm known to act a hoe, and I can't talk to her she shop at fashion nova
I said she keep yelling and she keep tripping I don't understand because the ass is ?
She call me a snake I'm known to pack a cobra we go through it then we laugh it off
Yes I'm smooth like a casanova, imma be this way till my tax is over
If you stay aligned I can give advice that'll keep you going that'll get you right
And I got the cheese don't see many mice, she keep tryna leave don't see many nights
All I do is think you just keep on writing, diamonds out the sink this is not a brightener
Keep a patek clean cause I'm bout my values this is balmain I don't have a stylist
That is chump change that's sad silence
That's a mustang what are you, in college
Meet the upgrade to a new ferrari come on baby put you right in parking
And I must say I was wylin' wylin', and I must say change with perfect timing
And I must say that's a lot of shining for a pretty woman call her Julia Roberts

There's some times that I get lonely I get lonely
There's some times that I get lonely, I get lonely
When I take my time, know I always end it with the motions
When she calls my line, you know I am mourning, I am mourning
There's some times that I get lonely, I get lonely
There's some times that I get lonely, I get lonely
When I take my time, know I always end it with the motions
When she calls my line, you know I am mourning, I am mourning

I be gone by the midnight
I be gone when it’s midnight
In the Audi R8 running red lights
