XXX,XXX,2011,"30!
Colder than them grits they fed slaves
Me to rap is like water to raves
AK's with bayonets on deck, rep my set
Sorta like Squidward and his clarinet
I'm in ya bitch mouth but she fantasizing
Staring at the skinnies, said it's so tantalizing
Dog I'm strategizing, plotting on the throne
The masta of the ace sitting on chrome
Dark nights tryna sleep stomach on fire
Delusional from hunger so I couldn't get tired
Imagining the equalizer goin' from green to red
Words that rhyme together just appear all in my head
And I'm sorta like Neo with the Matrix code
I try to escape it hoping the drugs'll numb my soul
Say I'm getting old and time's running out
Repeating instrumentals, tryna figure patterns out
I never leave the house, ain't slept in three days
Popping pills, writing, drinking and smoking haze
Weaving kicks and snares, tryna dodge these hooks
Keepin' it original, something that's overlooked
The way a nigga going might go out like Sam Cooke
Or locked up calling home for money on my books
'Cause if this shit don't work, nigga, I failed at life
Turning to these drugs, now these drugs turned my life
And it's the downward spiral, got me suicidal
But too scared to do it so these pills will be the rifle
Surpassing all my idols, took the wrong turn
But can't go back now so let that blunt burn
'Cause now it's my turn if I fuck it all up
Took a while to get here now I depend on these drugs
I took a while to get here now I depend on these drugs

Really Doe,Atrocity Exhibition,2016,"You niggas don’t even know
All that talk then no show
Cannot tell me nothin'
Show me somethin' I ain't seen before
That hoe want my piccolo
Smoking on that mistletoe
Make her kiss all on it
While we chop chop on them 24s
She look like a centerfold
Mouth all on my genitals
Suckin' on it like she gettin' vitamins and minerals
I be on the chemicals, she be on my testicles
Poke her with my tentacle then put her out my schedules
Rolling up them vegetables
Rapping with that special flow
Only way you're next to blow if you be strapped with C4
I be fresh from head to toe, every day a fashion show
Used to tote that Calico and serve like John McEnroe
Now I sell out all my shows
Used to sell out all my blow
That was back when we was coppin' dubs to try and roll up 4
Now a nigga livin' good
I done made it out the hood
Think I'm goin' back?
I wish a motherfucker would

Yeah, they say I got the city on fire
I ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, woah
Really doe, like really doe
Really doe, like really doe
They say I got the city on fire
I ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, woah
Really doe, like really doe
Really doe, like really doe

Still wicked as Aleister, Crowley niggas know me well
For heaven's sake, I'm the GOAT, you haters can go to hell
When you're getting money, nigga, every day is sunny
I'ma act an ass on that donkey, let her pull my ponytail
Second grade, took my mama weddin' ring, took that bitch
To show-and-tell, now I'm married to the game to no avail
Grounded me for like a month, now I'm gettin' high as fuck
Employer tryna write me up, but now I'm a writer
With ambitions of a rider, and half the shit on my rider I don't even want, the Fanta's for us, the Henny's for the sluts (chyeah)
Givenchy bikers with the rev rips
Balmain badmon, Bathing Ape on my dick
Paid by the Bloods, raised by the Crips
Soulo Ho3 the prophecies, atrocities, exhibition
Oh yeah, now a nigga livin' good
But good could be better I wish a motherfucker would

Yeah, they say I got the city on fire
I ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, woah
Really doe, like really doe
Really doe, like really doe
They say I got the city on fire
I ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, woah
Really doe, like really doe
Really doe, like really doe

Life is like an appetite of truth and dare, I double dare ya
Life to end in vain before the end is near
See I can hear you crying
Silence sittin' in the dark
Holdin' crosses 'cross your heart
Sin is such a work of art
Watch out for the love lost

Bet a thousand, shoot a thousand
Things a nigga do for thousands
Made a million counting sheep
Gave it all to public housin'
Taking off to Abu Dhabi
Beamin' up the motor, Scotty
Talking to promoters, Scotty
Everybody know it's Gotti
Murder one, you've heard of them
The rev undid, the all day madness
Got it off the wipe it off, the evidence, the blood on mattress
Big power, big stages
My zoo cannot fit the cages
This booth is not used to fakin'
My crew just love confrontation
I chewed the face off the laces
I moved the weight from the waitress
I chef the pot that made poison
I cooked then kicked all the patients
My bitch is way beyond basic
That's life insurance, car insurance, good pussy insurance
Ayy, look what we're enduring
Ayy, ridin' in foreigns
Ayy, K-Dot, four years, I got the same watch
But it's the real watch and that bitch fire
Speed Racer waitin' outside
The roof on it like a tank top
Countin' money, watchin' paint dry
When I'm done is when the rain stops, uh

They say I got the city on fire
I ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, woah
Really doe, like really doe
Really doe, like really doe
They say I got the city on fire
I ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, woah
Really doe, like really doe
Really doe, like really doe

Good, hood
I wish you motherfuckin' would
Listen, wish a motherfucker would, Brown
I had to put my foot down
It's like I'm popping a clutch
Your hate palpable, your jaw full of dust
You gon' keep talkin' or are we lockin' it up?
And I'm the type of nigga it ain't never been an honor to judge
You a mouse that the falcon picked up
So disrespect will get you checked like the top of the month
I was a liar as a kid so now I'm honest as fuck
And I never pass my mama no blunt
And kept my head straight
Listen deadweight never been a problem to dunk
Look, I just broke up with my bitch cause we ain't argue enough
I keep it dirty as a spliff my uncle Alchemist puff
I strike a birdie on 'em, while I hit your mouth with the club
I wake up early on 'em, gettin' out the house is a must
It's like a sweaty pit, sweaty sick, countin' your dubs
Either that or you gon' catch me on a mountain with monks
Loungin', ask your girl why her mouth on my nuts
You've been the same motherfucker since 2001
Well it's the left-handed shooter, Kyle Lowry the pump
I'm at your house like, ""Why you got your couch on my Chucks?""

Grown Up,UnKnown,2012,"Remember when my first meal was school lunch
Now I spit a 16 straight with no punch
Remember all for dinner all we ate was Captain Crunch
Now we blow big blunts on the way to brunch
Went from good fella to commissary slips
Now I got back up man every time I slipped
Never ever quit, I just kept on pursuing
Teacher always ask me, what was I doing
Scribbled in my notebook and never did homework
Low attention span, guess these Adderall worked
Rocked Tommy Hil shirts, ones with the boat
Rockport kicks way before we even smoked
Used to have baby lungs, choking when I hit it
Nowadays lace a whole seven in a sitting
Remember back then we thought we growed up
Rushing as a kid just to be grown up

Rushing as a kid just to be grown up
Yeah, whoever thought I'd be the greatest growing up?

I can eat a pound and shit sixty four quarters
Burn up fire and drown drops of water
Son, I told you I got them beans like Goya
Gone off them pills, got me jumping off the sofa
Hotter than a Hot Pocket out the devil microwave
Model bitches begging just be a nigga sex slave
Exotic foreign garments lookin' tailor made
And when these bitches see me man, they wetter than the everglades
Everyday same shit, me getting paid
Waking up, new bitch, me getting laid
Used to take bottle back
, 
waitress bring the bottle back
Now they see me shining and they looking like a Sour Patch
Niggas catch a heart attack
Newport soft pack never blow blunt wraps
But these blunt raps sewn up
Whoever thought I'd be the greatest growing up?

Rushing as a kid just to be grown up
Whoever thought I'd be the greatest growing up?",https://genius.com/Danny-brown-grown-up-lyrics
I Will,XXX,2011,"Put a cup up, put a four up in it

What he won't do, bitch, I will

Take it off, baby, bend over, let me see it
You looking for a real pussy eater? I can be it
Quit playing with me, girl, and bring that over here
And climb aboard my face, put that pussy on my beard
I ain't tryna take you shopping, buy your ass no shoes
I'm tryna lick that clit while I'm looking up at you
No shame in my game, girl, look back at me
I don't give a fuck if it's shaved or it's nappy
Long as it ain't nasty, sanitation smelling
One whiff of that bitch, I'mma be bailing
If it's smelling sweet, I'mma lick it for a hour
And even if it's sour, I might lick it in the shower
I go dumb and ignorant when I'm on that clitoris
Lick your ass delirious, my tongue game so damn serious
So bend that ass over, let me eat it from the back
That pussy so good, have a nigga coming back

Oh, that nigga scared, let me show you what it's 'bout
Spread apart them lips, put that clit up in my mouth
And that thang so juicy, I'mma call it jamba
Licking it in circles got me calling me your papa
Tongue going faster, singing La Labamba
Tryna keep my rhythm like the bongos in samba
I'm a pussy monster, blowing on that ganja
After I finish, look like you was in a sauna
Toes curling up while you're grabbing on the sheets
Spitting on that pussy real sloppy when I eat
Slobbing on that pussy, after that, I don't cuddle
I put that dick up on her, make her sleep up in the puddle
Bitch, I ain't afraid, I eat it up in public
Feet up on the windshield, broad day, fuck it
Sixty-nine in hotels with the lights on
Tongue worth a million, I don't need ice on

Put a cup up, put a four in it
Sixes on that Chevy with some hoes in it
Them hoes playing, they don't wanna fuck
I'mma put they ass out, they gone be walking, bruh

""Baby, come on. Let's cut this place loose.""
""Ayyy, chump, you better get the fuck out of here, and take your bitches with you, especially Ug-Mug here.""

The Hybrid, smoking on papaya
That give you niggas bronchitis, what you write is all vagina
What I write is Wall of China, nigga, that's ""Great""
Like eighths of Grape Ape getting stuffed in my suitcase
Ready to hit the studio and shit all on your mixtape
Nah, literally—shit all on your mixtape
Wipe with the credits, leave stains on the jewel case
In just two takes, dog, the booth'll get souffléd
You're hiding something like a toupee
Truthfully, my friend: touché
You gon' get exposed like an up-and-coming model
And to me, your label seems like one of them pageant mamas
So guess who's the little bitch? That's you
You must suck a lot of dick: That's true
I misuse with issues and pistols
Mind racing like Bristol, heart of igloos
My nigga, you ain't been what I been through
And if so, you would take a pencil through your temple
'Cause I done served fiends on they menstrual
Ain't even have pads, stuffed they panties with tissue
Hit the Ave. 'cause they mouth ain't bleeding
And your style's like fried chicken without the seasoning
Nigga, that's bland; fuck you up and your mans
I smack you like a bitch, nigga, that's open-hand
Fuck you and your tough talk
When I monopolize, I throw your ass off the boardwark
Fag, you ain't play sports, but always at the ballpark
Type of nigga rocking Crocs at the fucking Walmart
Drunk like Stallworth, riding in a fiend car
Get flicked, guess what? I'm running from this fiend car
I know a nigga dirty and got the hammer
But this kush got me high like Pac bandanna

I'm a smart nigga, that do dumb shit
In your baby mama crib, not flushing after I piss
I'm Ferris Bueller with Frank Muellers, you blank shooters
On stank hooters, I'm in Aruba, sipping wine cooler
Mind-ruler, sort of like hypnotism
That's why these white bitches wanna get with him
I smack it, flip it, like Mike Bivins
But to me, your flow's like Ronny DeVoe's
My hoes got toes in expensive high heels
Your hoes' toes is fucked—beauty supply sandals
Handle any situation
I smoke blunts to the face to stay motivated
Irritated when I'm not sedated
Fuck her face like I was obligated
And still fucking with them freak hoes
Stank pussy smelling like Cool Ranch Doritos",https://genius.com/Danny-brown-monopoly-lyrics
25 Bucks,Old ,2013,"25 bucks, momma braid your hair
Sit on the porch, she'll do it on the stairs
Grew your hair out and you wanna get it twisted
Fed us many nights, nigga, that's how we was living
25 bucks, momma braid your hair
Sit on the porch, she'll do it on the stairs
Grew your hair out and you wanna get it twisted
Fed us many nights, nigga, that's how we was living

I'll not get old
If I dig with my knees, if I grind down my teeth
I know from the attic of me
From the bottoms of pleas, 
from the waywarded seas

Arthritis in her fingers, carpal tunnel in her wrists
'Bout to feed her kids at night sit between her legs and twist
While she listen to the oldie soap operas 
smoking bogies
On the phone gossiping telling homegirls stories
Girlfriend worried cause her son's in a hurry
To see the state Pen' or a cemetery buried
Ma replied do her best but it's still rough
Keep your kids off the street and away from drugs
Doing hair in the house ain't putting on Daniel
Daddy in and out, ay, who turned that channel?
Sneakers turn to house shoes, stepping on the back
Ashing her cigarette and a brown paper bag
Smoking joints, lauging tryna get the part straight
For ten, put your perm in, don't scratch all day
Hot cocoa stove, put the food in the bowl
Say that's how many nights it was hard to keep going
Now I'm trapped in the trap and the devil ain't forgetting
Wanna see me dead or locked in a prison
In the system with division only thing that add up
Fucked up cause a nigga tryna get a couple bucks
Now I'm trapped in the trap and the devil ain't forgetting
Wanna see me dead or locked in a prison
In the system with division only thing that add up
Fucked up nigga tryna get a couple bucks

25 bucks, momma braid your hair
Sit on the porch, she'll do it on the stairs
Grew your hair out and you wanna get it twisted
Fed us many nights, nigga, that's how we was living
25 bucks, momma braid your hair
Sit on the porch, she'll do it on the stairs
Grew your hair out and you wanna get it twisted
Fed us many nights, nigga, that's how we was living

I'll not get old
If I dig with my knees, if I grind down my teeth
I know from the attic of me
From the bottoms of pleas, 
from the waywarded seas

Iverson zig zags,
 good night fast food
If you really balling, mommy cop Chinese food
If you really wonder why these people got issues
Cause the rent owed and the fucking lights due
On her knees at night, pray a miracle come through
Daddy shooting Craps, tryna win a pair of shoes
I been growing my hair 'bout to let mommy twist it
Out wilding with my friends, even got myself a biscuit
Homie momma smoking with nothing to lose
Now he stashing cracks in some hundred dollar shoes
Sitting at his crib, smoking Swishers, getting faded
Told me hit my mommy up, cause he tryna get braided
What we gon' do see the local dope man
See if he can put some money in our hand
Same one jump me, the same one front me
Cause I'm tired of seeing my family fucked up and hungry
Now I'm in the trap and the devil ain't forgetting
Wanna see a nigga dead or locked in a prison
In the system with division only thing that add up
Fucked up nigga tryna get a couple bucks
Now I'm trapped in the trap and the devil ain't forgetting
Wanna see a nigga dead or locked in a prison
In the system with division only thing that add up
Fucked up cause a nigga tryna get a couple bucks

Ain’t it Funny,Atrocity Exhibition,2016,"Verbal couture
Parkour
With the metaphors
The flow house of horror
Dead bolted with metal doors
Grinch bitch
Six sense
With a nose drip
Mind skydive
Sniffing bumps
In the cockpit
Locksmith of Hip Hop
Appraisal the wrist watch
The rocks bout the size
As the teeth in Chris Rock's mouth
Sock out the mic
Prototype for Adderall
Your work killing fiends
Cause you cut it with Fentanyl
So much coke
Just to sniff need a ski lift
Flip your table over
If you cut it with the bullshit
Nose bleeds red carpets
But it just blend in
Snapping pictures
Feeling my chest being sunk in
Live a fast life
Seen many die slowly
Unhappy when they left
So I try to seize the moment

Funny how it happens
Who ever would imagine
That joke's on you
But Satan the one laughing

Ain't it funny how it happens
Ain't it
Ain't it funny how it happens
Ain't it
Ain't it funny how it happens
Ain't it

I can sell honey to a bee
In the fall time
Make trees
Take back they leaves
Octopus in a straight jacket
Savage with bad habits
Broke serving fiends
Got rich became a addict
Ain’t it funny how it happens
Who would ever would imagine
Nose running right now
Could ya pass me a napkin
Managed to somehow
To have the upper advantage
Panic when the drugs are gone
And nobody is answering
Ain’t it funny how it happens
Ain't it
Ain't it funny how it happens
No way to mask it
A lot became has beens
Rolling up that 100 dollar bill
Till they cash in
Thinks it gone last
Going too fast
Man it's fucked up
Ain't it funny how it happens

Ain't it funny how it happens
Ain't it
Ain't it funny how it happens
Ain't it
Ain't it funny how it happens
Ain't it
Ain't it funny how it happen

Upcoming heavy traffic
Say ya need to slow down
Cause you feel yourself crashing
Staring in the devil face
But ya can’t stop laughing
Staring in the devil face
But ya can't stop laughing
It’s a living nightmare
That most of us might share
Inherited in our blood
It's why we stuck in the mud
Can’t quit the drug use
Or the alcohol abuse
Even if I wanted to
Tell you what I’m gonna do
I’ma wash away my problems
With this bottle of Henny
Anxiety got the best of me
So popping them Xannies
Might need rehab
But to me that shit pussy
Pray for me y’all
Cause I don't know what coming to me
Bought a 8 ball of coke
And my nigga on the way
Got 3 hoes with him
And they all tryna play

Ain't it funny how it happens
Who ever would imagine
Jokes on you
But Satan the one laughing

Ain't it funny how it happens

Die Like a Rockstar,XXX,2011,"Brown bless the mic like gesundheit
Bud 'bout the size of a bonsai
Kick it like Muay Thai, flow like Sci-Fi in high def
I'm righteous and still bust a nut up on a bitch chest
The verbal folklore been explored
And employed by none other than them fools with the gold
And them bankrolls explode
And your bitch in my target when I shoot my load
Bullseye, my eyes tie-dyed
Fried off the same shit that rockstars died... from
Smoke somethin' with your man, bitch
Like Wyclef, used to sell the cannabis
Manuscript, sick shit, prescription addiction
Sniffing Adderall off the counter in my kitchen
Tripping off the shit that had Brian Wilson flipping
Experiment so much, it's a miracle I'm livin'

And I'ma die like a rockstar
Die like a rockstar
I'ma die like a rockstar
Die like a rockstar
I'ma die like a rockstar
Die like a rockstar
I'ma die like a rockstar

Bitch, I wanna party like Chris Farley
Shot of Hennessy, spike that with some molly
Tell mommy I'm sorry, God bless my soul
But life was so sublime, goin' out like Brad Nowell
I got that Kurt Cobain type of mindframe
Feelin' like Keith Moon, shrooms in my dressing room
Basquiat freestyle
Feeling like Jimi Hendrix in Anna-Nicole mouth
River Phoenix, '93, VIP
With some drugged-up porn hoes all around me

30,XXX,2011,"Sent ya bitch a dick pic and now she need glasses
Turn your bitch Slick Rick right now if I flashed it
Ate a couple pills and took the bud out the plastic
Flicking bogey ashes, bitch, I stay blasted
Microphone Cassius,
 
Magic with the sick shit
'Posed to been dead, but bitch, I'm still up in this bitch
Verbal herbal poison, words I contortion
Fucked a pregnant bitch, she saved money on her ga-bortion
I feel like Billy Corgan in a church playing organ
Covering Too Short, smoking a Newport
Kurt hoped the drugs would make the pain go away
But all these thoughts up in my head made the sane go astray
So step inside the mind that revolves around the rhyme
And every time he close his eyes, visions of white lines
Dying in the arms of a blonde, blue-eyed 20-something
Don't know her name but the paramedics chest-pumping
""30 something black male, OD'ed off of pills
That he wasn't prescribed, but they took his life""
Left behind a daughter that don't really even know him
'Cause her mama thought he wouldn't make a living off of poems""
But it was a long journey on a rocky road
Had a hoody on and a jacket in the snow
Walking in the cold on the way to the studio
Nigga, that was just a couple years ago
Dropped a couple mixtapes on the net
Niggas tried to front like it wasn't all that
But guess what, bitch, I'm coming back
Guess what, bitch, I'm coming back
Signed to Fool's Gold and everything is all gnarly
Now these bitches want my number to get up in the party
Came a long way from extension cords in the window
Borrow neighbor's power just to plug up the Nintendo
Where the ovens never closed and the stoves never off
Every winter so cold niggas sleeping wearing scarf
But I always tell myself that it's gonna get better
You know who you is? You the greatest rapper ever
So now the pressure's on, to prove that voice right
Some people never know they goals, knew mine my whole life
So now his turn's up, fixing up to bat
Pitching singles to the label when I used to pitch crack
I never learned to rap, always knew how
Ever since a nigga 8, knew what I would do now
When I turned 28, they like, ""What you gon' do now?""
And now a nigga 30, so I don't think they heard me
That the last ten years, I been so fucking stressed
Tears in my eyes, let me get this off my chest
The thoughts of no success got a nigga chasing death
Doing all these drugs, hope for OD'ing next, Triple X",https://genius.com/Danny-brown-30-lyrics
Kush Coma,Old ,2013,"Close my eyes, feel like I'm going down in an elevator at 90 miles an hour
And all I see is stars and they coming at me sort of like a meteor shower
My forehead's sweaty, my eyelids heavy, feeling like I ain't going make it
Cause inside my head's like a firework show in the 4th July in Las Vegas
Said, I'm tripping, I'm slipping, feeling like I just can't move
I done took me a couple more pills
Next thing I know, I'm taking off my shoes
And I'm on walking on these clouds like marshmallows
Nodding off, smelling like rose petals
Zoning out, two-three, like the fiend in hell fire and angel wings
I'm conscious to that world, connin science 'bout that world
All these drugs up in me, it's a miracle I ain't mirror Kurt
I'm numb like a mortician, going dumb with Oakland bitches
They say you hella boosie, roll a backwood up with them cookies

I'm smoking, back to back, back to back, back to back
It's the blunt after blunt rotation
Now I'm in a kush coma off the OG aroma
And my brain going on vacation
I'm smoking, back to back, back to back, back to back
It's the blunt after blunt rotation
Now I'm in a kush coma off the OG aroma
And my brain going on vacation

Kush coma, I am in a kush coma

Get high, my niggas smoke kush
Get fly, my niggas, dope looks
So many numbers in my phone book
I could start a mothafuckin' phone book
Know all the fly bitches gonna look
Like I'm on something, tell 'em roll something
I'm that one nigga bumping 2Pac
Be like three hoes, that's a foursome
Fuck niggas always want to hold something
Young hot nigga done froze on 'em
Went cold on 'em, beat the golds on 'em
And clothes on 'em, see the hoes on 'em?
Only fear God, never sold on Him
Man, I swear to God, put my soul on Him
Life's a bitch, but she chose on him
Should've died in Hell, but I rose on 'em
In big shades, fuck the hypocrites, stop
Time let the tats, for the tick, tock
Clocks on the wall, fuck your wristwatch
Pause, let it stop, hope we get by
Bye when I zoom, let it vroom
'bout a hundred goons with a fume, better let it fuse
A hundred miles an hour on the booth, finna let it loose
A hundred by the sour, molly, flower, and they love the shrooms
That's real rap, I'm stating facts
Contradictions, can't take it back
Lil mommy's stripping, make it clap
In a kush coma, finna take a nap (I'm out)

Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma

Half asleep with that cotton mouth, weed grow house on plantation
Nuggets the size of Rakim rings, got my head looking like a fatality screen
Got my mind dripping, gotta get away from all this bullshit in my way
Knowing goddamn well when the high go away
Same shit gon' be still in my way
I'm a slave to the sticky icky, so nigga roll something with me
Been smoking blunts since high school
Now look at all the bullshit I been through
Wanna pass out, but we stayin up, nigga gotta keep one eye open
Cause nigga ain't tryna miss the next turn
Nigga roll up, then we starting smoking
I'm smoking on that ocho, got my mind on that cosmos
Sipping on that purple, got a nigga in slo-mo
Dipping in that molly, feel like I'm doing 100 on a Harley
Tell your baby momma sorry, that was one night and please don't call me

I'm smoking, back to back, back to back, back to back
It's the blunt after blunt rotation
Now I'm in a kush coma off the OG aroma
And my brain going on vacation
I'm smoking, back to back, back to back, back to back
It's the blunt after blunt rotation

Ate that bitch pussy 'til she squirted like a dolphin
Told her bend over, hit that shit doggy
Called her a cab then I told that bitch to call me
Danny Brown bitch, tell me what you need
I got some Adderall and fire ass weed
And they try to tell me I get too high
That's a lie, if so, bitch, I woulda been died
But the flow OD, don't get cochesed, capiche?
Fuck with me, fuck around and be deceased
Rest in peace wack niggas with your oversized clothes
Complain about my jeans cause I'm taking all they hoes
Hold up, wait a minute
Your pussy ain't shit 'til you had some Danny in it
I'm gone off a Xanny nodding off watching Menace
Rolling on some purple that my nigga call Grimmace
Bitch I ain't finish
These bars was test tubed in the lab with foreign chemist
Rolling testers on it but statistics got slumped
I'm smoking blunt after blunt

And I smoke
Blunt after blunt, after blunt, after blunt, after blunt, after blunt
And I smoke

You fell off like Tom Selleck in a Celica
Bitch give me brain for the hell of it
But to her it's heaven even if she gets a smell of it
That's why these bitches fuck with me
Cause I eat that pussy like a female MC
You get it? How about me and your girlfriend, you with it?
Money over everything the only thing that matter
And since I been getting it my been blunts getting fatter
Take a couple puffs off it now a nigga woozy
The white hoes I fuck with consider them whooties

And I do my own stunts, I'm smoking blunt after blunt

Outer Space,XXX,2011,"Meet the future face to face
It makes you feel like you're there in outer space
Beneath the seas

It's the Adderall Admiral,
 
writing holy mackerel
Your bitch say my dick long like the strap on a satchel
I took me a capsule with no hassle
Now it's like I dip feathers of ink in a castle
A prodigy like bullets that hit your left clavicle
Melt sweat suits and paint the avenue
You have no clue like toy stores without board games
But when I paint pictures, I'm dipping brushes in war paint

I'm a mothafuckin' mothafucka
Fucking on your mother with two rubbers, I do fuck her
No cover, just her booty on a pillow
Your bitch said my dick tastes like tropical fruit Skittles
I'm bumping Bill Withers,
 
Swishers on Schwarzenegger
Matter fact, nah nigga, they on Boa Constrictors, they'll choke a nigga
These niggas ain't rappers, they mothafuckin' characters
Caught your baby momma horny then I stuck a carrot in her
Then you made a salad with her, ate it for dinner
I don't want that skinny bitch look like that ho from Thinner
Swore she played soccer, she was real good with headers
Had me yelling ""Goal!"" while I was sitting on the dresser
Give the bitch a hat trick,
 smoking on the cat piss
I keep the bitch wet, around you she's a cactus

I got them Penis Poems for your Vagina Monologues
Love a feminist bitch, oh, it get my dick hard
So no apologies for all the misogyny
I just want your company to come and watch some porn with me
My oral orchestration causes manipulation
The way these hoes be chasing though I had the tongue of Satan
But I just gave 'em dick to get more for conversation
Why you niggas tricking, giving your obligation
You safe havens, I'm Wes Craven with X cravings
Fuck a bitch mouth until her fucking face cave in
Hidden cams in her house, I caught her masturbating
Extorted her for the cash, now your ass paying
You Captain Save-'Em-ass nigga
I don't give a bitch shit but hard dick and liquor
So, so nice to meet you, I hope that you safe",https://genius.com/Danny-brown-outer-space-lyrics

My dick head, she celebrate like the world end
And she could be my girlfriend
Only fuck her on the weekend
Momma found some racks in some dirty jeans
Told her keep the money, take 'em to the cleaners
Threesome watched how this dick came between them
Licked the clit and she did the Macarena
Crib in the forest, deer in my yard
'07, I got locked up on a charge
Now a nigga got four bank cards
Looking like a nigga gotta thank God
Going through a bag like I'm snatching purses
Half a key of raw inside my fucking verses
Like a surgeon with that scalpel, bring that track to life
Bounce that ass for that pussy, got a appetite
Geeked up, geeked up, pop a pill just like Mike and Ikes
Head sent me straight to the moon with a mac tonight
Running low on alcohol, nigga gotta make a call
Stay afloat, try not to choke

Tackled her asshole, my dick was like a lasso
Fucked her in her mouth, she washed it down with Tabasco

You softer than Flanders' son
Don't make me put hands on son
Jump niggas like fuck one on one
Used to be locked up watching One on One
Young Kyla Pratt was looking thick, nigga wanted some
But soon as I got out white bitches by the tons

I fuck bad bitches to Stacy Lattisaw
While you niggas got blue balls like a Avatar
I'm eating caviar in El Salvador
She running from my dick like it's a bull and she the matador
She a pregnant labrador
Said my metaphors are the highest caliber

I spit hard, you Hallmark card poets
So many lines, you can bar code it
She like to lick it on the head then slow stroke it
Ocean in her panties and I'm 'bout to float through it
Rewind this and just smoke to it",https://genius.com/Danny-brown-adderall-admiral-lyrics
Tell Me What I Don’t Know,Atrocity Exhibition,2016,"Street smart, Ph.D
Dropped out for a slanging degree
9 on me, keep the devils off me
'Cause we was living in hell, couldn't afford property
Lil nigga gettin' frontin' from OGs
Oz of reggie bagged up in the Pelle
In a school hallways on a burnout celly
Leaving out of class early, caught a sale for 20
How long will it last?
Never ending race, chasin' cash
One lane going wrong way 'til I crash
Teacher find my sack, going nowhere fast

Tell me what I don't know
Last night homie got killed at the liquor store
Shot my nigga on the way to get a Swisher
Breaking down the weed when the call got received

We was so ambitious
All we really wanted was new Jordans and some bitches
Flashing bankrolls in the club taking pictures
Thinking we was grown men, really lil' niggas
Jumping dope fiends that's owing us for credit
Taking turns catching sales things copacetic
Slice your tomato if you owe us for the lettuce
Running through the sack of D sorta like Jerome Bettis
Naive to the outcome
Cuz hit the block, hit the stash and they found some
Lock us all up for a bag and some pistols
Now we in the county writing letters I miss you

Tell me what I don't know
Hook raid came through kickin' down the front door
Now we facin' judge, got us sitting at the court
Gave us all probation now we smokin' Newports

When It Rain,Atrocity Exhibition,2016,"Have you ever been, uh, stiffed at work?
No, I've never been stiffed... at work

With a bat
Go dangerous on that cat
Go Traxman, hit it from the back
DJ Assault, bitch, let me bang
Bruiser Brigade, we run that train
Put that thang in her caboose
Only way you hang is with a noose
Beef with us, it ain't no truce
Y'all niggas lame, y'all ain't like us
Hanging with the devil off angel dust
For that money, in God we trust
All fall victim for greed and lust
Who you 'pose to trust when guns gone bust?
Living every day like it's the end
Just waking up, feelin' like a sin
Gotta keep a eye on your friends
Cause everybody hungry in them streets
Nigga rob ya grandma for something to eat
Know it's fucked up, that's how it be
Growing up living everyday in the D
And it don't seem like shit gon' change
No time soon in the City of Boom
Doomed from the time we emerged from the womb
So to cope, drugs we consume
Here we go, now, here we go
Ain't no water, how a flower gon' grow?
Ain't no change, then how we gon' change?
No umbrella, we stuck in the rain
Dark clouds hanging all over our head
No sunshine and them showers be lead
Lighting up squares and them dots be red
Now ya best friend gets shot in the head, damn

Oh, you ain't know that
When it rain, when it pour, get your ass on the floor now
Oh, you ain't know that, did you?
Better duck when you hear them gunshots go off
Pop off when them shots go off
Knock off, you try to play me soft
Glocks all in yo face, dog
No baseball, better run home
Hit ya lung, blood on yo tongue
Exorcist, yo head get spun
Exodus, I might forget
Bitch, when it's time for your ass be done

You ain't heard it like this before
They don't do it like this no more
That get on up, that get on up
That get on up, up on the floor
You ain't heard it like this before
They don't do it like this no more
That get on up, that get on up
That get on up, up on the floor

Oh, you ain't know that, did you?
When it rain, when it pour, get your ass on the floor now
Oh, you ain't know that
When it rain, when it pour, get your ass on the floor now
Oh, you ain't know that, did you?
When it rain, when it pour, get your ass on the floor now

Time for the percolator
Murder music orchestrator
Point blank hollow tip circulator
Your ass lucky if you on respirator
I'm like Vega rolling with that blade
Kid don't play, wanna catch that fade?
Shoot the house party up with them K's
Shut down when we hit the DJ
That Detroit shit, do the Rambisco
Minks and Gators, pistol the disco
Eating crawfish up in Fishbones
Heater off safety, watching the Pistons
Niggas get pissed on no-fly zone
Call Uncle Trick when you hit my home
Beef with him? Don't hit my phone
D vs. everybody, ain't no song
Coming from the city where them goons be lurking
Get caught slipping, yo ass will be hurting
That's for certain, yo ass be curtains
Young niggas out there puttin' that work in
On you scoring for a pair of Jordans
Whole damn city probably got a couple warrants
Why the county jail always stay crowded
They don't give a fuck, they just go POP

Oh, you ain't know that
When it rain, when it pour, get your ass on the floor now
Oh, you ain't know that, did you?
Better duck when you hear them gunshots go off
Pop off and all them shots go off
Knock off, you're tryna play me soft
Glocks out in your face, dawg
No baseball, better run home

You ain't heard it like this before
They don't do it like this no more
That get on up, that get on up

Off a 2 piece
A toothpick I flick
And I preach
Bout how I’m a get this money out here up in the streets
In the Caddy Ron Isley on between in the sheets
And a way a nigga work make a grip in a week
I’m a chill with this freak
Sniff a gram and a half
Plus her pussy juicier than Shalamar curl bag
While she draw me a bath
Roll a blunt then passed
Jiggled and giggled her booty
Couldn’t do nothing but laugh
Credit cards separating
White lines on a mirror
Roll a 100 dollar bill
Now my sinus all clearer
Flat screen porn on
Watching Asa Akira
Nothing on but my pinky ring
Sniff when I get up
On the balcony drunk
Like the world is mine
Staggering inside with my robe untied

So fuck waiting round
Nigga I’m about to get it
Dog I’m tryna eat
So I’m staying in the kitchen
Hunched over the stove
Gotta water water whip it
Lost in the sauce but a nigga still stirring
Packing up them bags but a nigga ain't tripping
Lost in the sauce but a nigga still dipping
Lost on the sauce but a nigga ain’t flipping
Cutting up the hard like the yard ain’t filling

I'm like Spielberg
With ill words and hoes on that curb
Gotta screw loose
I'm cuckoo
Mentally disturbed
But still smart enough
To hit this bitch wit a rubber
And with ya wrinkle pussy
Hoe can’t be ya lover
But I still get the head
If you swallow with bubbles
I'm a Linwood nigga I done traveled the world
Made a name for myself use to serve on the curb
Now my words worth a bird
I could front you a zip
Made a million in a year and I still ain’t trip
Bout to put my niggas on make a million for them
Show you that you can make it without acting like them
Do you lil nigga go out there and just get it
Gotta have a hardback
Because these niggas gon’ whip it
Do you lil nigga get up out there get it
Gotta have a hardback
Because these niggas gon’ whip it

So fuck waiting round
Nigga I’m about to get it
Dog I’m tryna eat

Hunched over the stove
Gotta water water whip it

Been in this room for 3 days
Think I’m hearing voices
Paranoid and think I’m seeing ghost-es, oh shit
Phone keep ringing but I cut that shit off
Only time I use it when I tell the dealer drop it off
Had a threesome last night, ain’t matter what it cost
Couldn’t it get hard, tried to stuff it in soft
Had to fuck em both raw, keep my fingers crossed
Been grinding on my teeth so long it's swelling up my jaw
Nothing on but my bathrobe and pinky ring
Your worst nightmare for me is a normal dream
And if I learned anything
Is don’t nod off with ya motherfucking cigarette burning
Knocking on my door but I won’t answer
Residue on mirrors, Jojo dancer

I gotta figure it out (out)
I gotta figure it out
Cause it's the downward spiral
I gotta figure it out (out)
Gotta figure it out (out)

Been high this whole time, don’t realize what I done
Cause when I’m all alone, feel like no one care
Isolate myself and don’t go nowhere
Smoking blunt after blunt, 'til my eyes start burning
Hennessy straight got my chest like a furnace
Drowning frustrations in a ocean of sin
Thinking irrational, I have no emotions
Cold cold world, some might say
Freezing on the snow, brain feel a bit frostbit
Nauseous, don’t know the last time I ate
But I eat these fucking rappers like fucking last steak
On death row, feel like I am
You never know, one day you're here, the next you're gone
So I put it all up in these songs...

See my jeans 'bout a stack, and my shoes cost 'bout half of that
Let's not talk 'bout the shirt, she can't even pronounce that
Ghetto Nigga in high end, my Theory is Low End
My Tribe on a Quest, put that money in motion

Pac Blood,XXX,2011,"The Shakespeare of 16s, dipping my ink pen
Made a sculpture of me but my dick was too thin
Paint pictures of me, but they never get my chin
One writing scriptures, bringing tears to the princess
Every time I indent, you can see the intent
Leave your mind bent, hanging onto every sentence
Have no apprentice, style uninherited
Laughing at you peasants 'cause my penmanship is excellence
Whenever in the presence, eyes get wide
I'm the town hero 'cause my words give them pride
And what they feel inside, I say the perfect words for
Some say I'm a prophet with the visions I get cursed for
Leave them all astonished, ride with the verbs
Make a grown man cry with strength of the words

Tears to Mona Lisa, Medusa to liquid
Flow can make Gandhi grab the burner, wanna shoot shit
Rhymes that'll make the Pope wanna get his dick sucked
Have Virgin Mary doing lines in the pickup
Make Sarah Palin deepthroat 'til she hiccup
Have T.D. Jakes round this bitch doing stick-ups
Rhymes so real, thought I wrote it in Pac blood
Told me in my dreams that these niggas is not thugs

Check!

What's in the portfolio? Sicker than polio
Shit so personal, my mom can't listen to
But oh-so-original, nigga's extra-crispy
Bars so Bukowski, Soda Popinski
Little Macs could never be number one, your time's done
Bomb filling smelling like napalm, your day's gone
Langston Hughes with a blew fuse and a screw loose
Maya Angelou, abused child with a notebook
Spitting like Kipling with a tooth missing
Tongue bring torture to men, women, and children
The memoir's sacred, hid in the basement
Await my next piece at a formal engagement
Crowds walk for miles just to hear that sound
Starting to get more power than the ones that wear crowns

Tears to Mona Lisa, Medusa to liquid
Flow can make Gandhi grab the burner, wanna shoot shit
Rhymes that'll make the Pope wanna get his dick sucked
Have Virgin Mary doing lines in a pickup
Make Sarah Palin deepthroat 'til she hiccup
Have T.D. Jakes round this bitch doing stick-ups
Rhymes so real, thought I wrote it in Pac blood
Told me in my dreams that these niggas is not thugs",https://genius.com/Danny-brown-pac-blood-lyrics

Radio Song,XXX,2011,"This is anti-clean rap, nigga, where the green at?
Risks I take, you'd swear I had the balls the size of beanbags
Not what you're used to, bitch, I rep the Bruiser
And the label Fools Gold, jeans with medusas
Bitches wanna scoop us, get pussy like loofahs
Y'all niggas losers cop clothes from the boosters
Hoes wanna choose up, of course, they gon' choose us
So though you need a stylist, also, you need a tutor
These stupid-ass niggas wouldn't know what to do
So they copy wack niggas—guess what that makes you?
The game's so trendy, that's why these labels fails
'Cause they don't care about music, just first-week sales

So they say you need a hit, a chart-topping single
That's why it's called commercial, because you need a jingle
A smash club banger, play it all night long
You never get on without a radio song
So this my radio song
This my radio song

She wanna ride the wave, watch me do my swag surf
Party like a rockstar, never bought a makeup purse
Songs with no feelings, but she feel my thing on her
Stripper with a leaky ceiling, I'ma make it rain on her
Taught me how to Dougie,
 
I'd rather see you jerk
Until it's skeet-skeet on the walls and her shirt
She'd rather hear a love song about what she getting
But not from Danny Brown, 'cause bitch, I ain't tricking
Do the pretty girl rock, and even though you ugly
Getting dirty money, but bitch, I ain't Puffy
Ice cream paint job, semi with the hemi
Heavy-duty Chevy, not a Beamer, Benz or Bentley
There's no originality, carbon-copy singles
He made ""Black and Yellow""?
 I'ma make ""Black and Emo""
That's why these wack rappers, they never last long
Don't care about music, just radio songs

So they say you need a hit, a chart-topping single
That's why it's called commercial, because you need a jingle
A smash club banger, play it all night long
You never get on without a radio song

Side B (Dope Song),Old ,2013,"31 years old so I done been through all that dizzirt
Came up off the porch, straight serving off the cizzurb
Long time ago, I don't do that shit no more
This the last time I'mma tell you, wanna hear it? (Here it goes!)
It was me and Baby James, with an ounce to our name
Rolling up two at a time, same clothes from yesterday
Had a smoke around a custo, paid his ass a stone
When the narcs came and raided hid on the roof and smoked bong
Fuck with rat bitches, head from them hunnies
Lost a sack but I got back, cause the dice game was hitting
It was me and Carbo, breaking day in the lobby
Nigga popping NoDoz, selling rocks as a hobby
Bankroll in my pocket, so everybody know me
Went home and gave my momma three hundred for some groceries
We hit the mall and ball, hit the club and spend it all
Now I'm back to Square A with them squares to get off

Sleep with the beast, Daniel in the lion's den
Still?drop?dirty, have to?pop a Niacin
Itched all damn day,?just to get violated
Ever seen a roach with babies have babies?
In the hood like whatever, we in this bitch together
Once got a ho, ain't had money for the room
So we did the humpty hump in a Burger King bathroom
Lowkey kept it undercover
The way she slurp slurp, she's the quicker picker upper
No job, dropped out and a felon
On the net, met a fat white bitch named Helen
300 pounds, maybe more like 280
Had a couple babies, 270 give or take it
Call that securin' the bag, had to fight the baby dad
Try to stop how I eat so I got up on his ass

What's in the dark, always come to light
Head was nasty, you'd think she had head lice
Why try? Throw bleach in your eye
Put your life on the line, hang 'em out to dry
Tryna keep my hands clean, out here ridin' dirty
Shit get messy? Mop him up with the .30
High Tide, Gain off the Arm and Hammer
Swim towards the current, system try to drown me
Stain your record like Clorox 'n' darks
Spin cycle had four tops for one
Out the slums, nobody gave me nothin'
Had temptations, so I hustled, David Ruffin
Papa was a rolling stone, so I sold rocks to 'em
Beam up Scotty, we got lift-off Houston
Left my sack in my clothes, Mama just did a load
Eight ball in my jeans, fiends say it taste like soap

Twenty five a peep show when I enter the booth
Mop the floor when I leave, might slip if you do
Cover your ears of your kids, we got round two
Fuck a bitch two times, call it deja vu
Fuck a stripper for some change, actual change
Dime, penny, nickels, actual change
Okay, wanna hear the story? Left the house in a hurry
I was at Hunky Dory's, got some dances from Lori
Left my wallet at home, ain't wanna hear that story
In the car had change from laundry
Had to wash clothes anyway, told her, ""I'm sorry""
Slow anyway, before you was boring
Said, ""Gimme a moment"", jumped on it and bounced
No fabric softener, 'cause I was hard
Then she gave me head, had me moaning and groaning
Guess who I seen doing laundry next morning?",https://genius.com/Danny-brown-dirty-laundry-lyrics

But don't feel for me
You know I'm in my zone
So don't speak to me
And in my mind I just feel so alone
Just release me

Feeling like I got money
Know I'm just nigga rich
Even if she fuck me
I still know life a bitch
Bought a nightmare, sold a dream
Happiness went upstream
Blame myself, I had no control
Now I'm living with no soul
I'm on a road that never ends
Don't know opposite of sin
Some people say I think too much
I don't think they think enough
Time rough but it got rougher
Weight heavier up on my shoulders
Living crooked 'til it's over
Can't be straight, can't be sober
Thought process so immature
Can't make it up, up out the sewer
Feeling like there's no hope
Blaze dope, my mind float
I love her, she love me
Love ain't enough with no bucks
Fucked up, that's the way it is
I don't know who I should trust
Riding around with the windows up
Smoking like it's ten of us
Just me in the back seat
With the driver bumping them Isleys
I'm walking on this long road
Will I come back?
Homie, I don't even really know

You know I'm living like a rolling stone
But don't feel for me
You know I'm in my zone
So don't speak to me
And in my mind I just feel so alone
Just release me

Feeling like I'm not alive
But I know I'm not dead
Living lies but can't hide
Deep inside, the truth dies
Bought hope, can't get change
Lost my brain, going insane
Self-medicate is how I cope
Leave my body, soul go afloat
On a roll that never ends
Don't know where I should begin
Feeling trapped, no looking back
Head first in that deep end
Living like a rolling stone
When I die, I leave alone
Getting high, I feel low
But we all know life goes on

You know I'm living like a rolling stone
But don't feel for me
You know I'm in my zone
So don't speak to me
And in my mind I just feel so alone
Just re-

All that I know
All that I know is to feel your shame
'Cause you can't let go
'Cause you can't let go, you drive me insane
But will I ever find my way?
Or go back to the beginning

Red 2 Go,Old ,2013,"Codeine in my cereal
Always behind a smokey, I'm sorta like a miracle
You rappers are venereal, and never in my stereo
Might spray your ass with vinegar, the next time that I see ya bro
Bet your ass still won't be tight
The size of my dick, nigga, every pussy tight
I write all night 'til the sun come up
Dodging texts from your sister tryna lick on my nuts
Cobra clutch the game, put that bitch into submission
Your bitch want the stick shift, no transmission
Dawg, I'm on a mission, you're playing exhibition
On an expedition, popping X but never tripping
Chilling with a vixen, tryna stick my dick in
Red head ho, like a young Kathy Griffin
Smoked so many blunts, I can hear my lungs whistling
Still rolling up, 
ho smelling like chicken
Rap 
Martin Lawrence,
 all you other rappers boring
Bruiser make 2 Live Crew look like some mormons
Nigga my essay is hard like a life-doing ese
Gang-banging on the yard with a home made machete
Been nice since cassette tapes,
 
stay smoking heavy
Popped a couple pills,
 
eye's glowing like Belly
Used to stash the cracks in the seams of my Pelle
Detroit nigga, but I'm smoking on LA

And is anybody nervous?
I'm red' to go, I said I'm red' to go
I said is anybody worried?
I'm red' to go, I said I'm red' to go
Is anybody scared?
I'm red' to go, I said I'm red' to go
Well, I used to be afraid
I'm red' to go, I said I'm red' to go

Tired of where I came from but know where I'm going
Tears in my eyes, cause I'm smoking on an onion
Aroma on that 'etra, 
scary and McNairy
Off of moon rocks in Barcelona popping cherries
Blowjobs from model twins, 
doing drugs with acronyms
So many lines, thought this shit was Busch Gardens
Party starting monster with the hair like Blanka
Hotel room like a hair metal concert
This blonde made the dick do the spray outta Contra
You disrespect I hit you with the slap of Tatanka
For dinner nigga used to eat shit that didn't match
Like cornbeef hash and some fucking Apple Jacks
Used to bag up the packs 
and eat Coney
 every night
Bologna all night,
 
traps with no peanut butter
Couldn't waste it on the mice,
 
so I wasted every night
Everything came with rice, and I knew I wasn't right
So I got my ass up, fuck depending on luck
Greyhound to NY 'bout 300 bucks
Kept my hopes up but my confidence was low
Now my self esteem is astral looking at this cash flow
Did it my way, I ain't nobody ho
I'm 'bout to pimp the rap game, bitch, I'm red' to go
I did it my way, I ain't nobody ho
I'm 'bout to pimp the rap game, bitch, I'm red' to go

And is anybody nervous?
I'm red' to go, I said I'm red' to go
I said is anybody worried?
I'm red' to go, I said I'm red' to go
Is anybody scared?

Wanna snatch my momma's plate, and tell her she can't eat
And we gone have us some discrepancies right here in this skreet
Because the weak don't speak, get left in silence
And when you don't listen, gotta speak with violence
And duct tape the grandmomma, strip a man of all his honor
Tryna be a G, now you wish you a goner
I walk with the Gods with a tongue for the devil
Tryna keep a nigga thirsty so for rain, I pray mercy

The return of the gangster cause niggas don't believe
I roll hotter than my sleeve, leave a nigga in the street
The return of the gangster cause niggas got bills
This rap shit don't work then its back to selling krills
Return of the gangster cause niggas want that real
Want that old Danny Brown but nigga I'm like chill

Twenty thousand out the public housing on a bad day
Drop it in the pot, if it ain't locking that's some bad yay

Devil on my shoulder as I'm whipping up this yola
And that motor hit the rotor ship this blow to Minnesota

The sack I got is looking like some green caterpillars
But it smell like a skunk that's oh so defensive
These bitches suck my dick like it was moral incentive
I'm off the chain like broke nunchucks
From where these little niggas try to shoot you off that new Chucks
A little dark like wet nubuck
Decribes my state of mind is inside the tomb of King Tut
Murders all the time is all I see
Detroit 187 on you niggas TV
And I can first agree this beat kill a nigga no charges
Fuck a female MC and a pop artist
Oh baby, I like it raw
And my dick so big left stretch marks on her jaw

I'm so institutionalized
I wake up 6 a.m. because I think it's chow time
Borderline porcupine, a step from drinking turpentine
Just to wash down a plate of wack rappers rhymes
I got a mind in the cosmos
And if these niggas cold then I guess I'm osmosis
That be blowing on some potent, that these white boys be growing
While you niggas smoking something smelling like a tanning lotion
My concoctions could make world ending potions
These other rap niggas got lines I got encroachments
I get endorsements, so motherfuck your co-sign
Punch punchlines I'll punch rappers 'til your broke spine
'member back in '09, I told 'em it was showtime
Now they pull they cam phones out when I go for mine
Light camera action, Hybrid be snapping
Cause the days of no tissue had to wipe with wet napkins
Smear up the classifieds know it sound trife
But to be honest a metaphor for my life

Buzzing off the barbiturates and amphetamines
Chase it with a 40 Oz of Ready Clean
I swear I never ever smoke the better weed
Your bitch said I'm the swaggiest nigga she ever seen
Run up in your crib, two K's, one mag
Your girl get snatched like Cool J in I'm Bad
Cost to live, you ain't made enough
Guarantee bullet holes with a laser touch
European garments drape my body if I ain't hipstered up
If she smile with eye contact then the bitch will fuck
Homie gon' make me send them killers after him
Them niggas swing swords like World Fence Champions
You was popping pills and drinking liquor
Now you thinking you a gangsta killer
I leave you stanking nigga, laid down
Face down like you taking a planking picture
But I can keep the shots in the weapon
Put the bat to back of your leg
Grab your chin and the back of your head
And twist them shits in opposite directions",https://genius.com/Danny-brown-detroit-187-lyrics

Why you on some pedo shit? Hit it then fuck her bitch
I don't think you know who you're fuckin' with (Yeah)

Two tears in a bucket, fuck it (Step)
I don't care about nothin', nothin' (No)
Two tears in a bucket, fuck it
I don't care about nothin', nothin' (Step)

Danny, it's dangerous, Run The Jewels is chaos in arrangements
Shit'll give your fuckface a facelift
Poppa did the Triple Lindsy flip when the 'caine hit
Mama never met a bottle that she couldn't drain quick (Ayy)
Stuck in a rude mood, the fuck shit approaches
Like we believe in nothin' Lebowski (Yes, Lebowski), there's no motive
I babble on, tryna get bags like, ""Fuck all of 'em""
Death is on my couch and I'm telling' him jokes, stallin' him
Plus, I offer one of my smokes, he smoked all of 'em (Fuck, man)
True doom, eat up your crew, like 
MM... FOOD
Say the name, it's like you prayin' for pain, but you rude
Got a brain? You gon' move it or lose it, you screwed
I'm profane, it's deranged, it is sick, real shit
If I'm correct, the really cool kids prolly callin' it lit (Hey kids)
Call it shit that I am culling from my brain with a switch
Hold my beer, I'm 'bout to go and get rich, motherfuckers

Three tears in a bucket, fuck it
I don't care about nothin', nothin'
Three tears in a bucket, fuck it
I don't care about nothin', nothin', hol' up

I 
don't give a fuck 'bout Trump, who got dump?
Who protesting collections at their garbage dump?
And I don't really give a fuck about givin' a fuck
And who feels that black celebrities ain't givin' enough
Give 'em the dick; fat, slick son of a bitch
Better than you are, what you are's the son of a whore
My dad told me that your mom was somethin' mean on her knees
But thank God we ain't related, 'cause she swallowed the seeds
Happy belated, I'm elated to know we ain't related
So tell your special kids stop saying Auntie Shana my lady
I sip on fine wines, fine dine with dimes and nines
I got an Einstein mind and I still tote iron
I'm a P-I-M-P in my own rhyme
Space-age gorilla pimpin' out the cage with mine
Would you steal for me, nigga?
If it's goddamn mine
Would you kill for me, nigga?
Bitch, you out your goddamn mind
And that's goddamn right, I'm goddamn Mike
Win in the end like Tina did goddamn Ike
[Chorus: Killer Mike, 
El-P
, & 
Both

Three tears in a bucket, 
fuck it
I don't care about nothin', 
nothin'
Three tears in a bucket, fuck it
I don't care about nothin', nothin'
, hol' up

Three tears in a bucket, fuck it
I don't care about nothin', nothin'
Bucket, fuck it
I don't care about nothin', nothin'
Three tears in a bucket, fuck it
I don't care about nothin', nothin'",https://genius.com/Danny-brown-3-tearz-lyrics
Wonderbread,Old ,2013,"On my way to get Wonderbread
I swear I just want the bread
Mommy gave me a book of food stamps
Said ""Go get some bread and a pop and come back""
Walk out the door, first thing I see
A dope fiend standing there looking at me
Standing right there, in front of the porch
With a pipe in his hand, in the other, a torch
I kept on moving, ain't worried 'bout that
'Bout a block later heard rat-tat-tat-tat
Next, some niggas from over there shooting
Dog I ain't blinked just kept it a-moving
Block later up, what do I find?
A junkie ho, at left and right, crime
Flagging up cars, getting her bread
And that's what I seen on the way to get bread

On my way to get Wonderbread
I swear I just want the bread
On my way to get Wonderbread
I swear I just want the bread
On the way to get Wonderbread
I swear I just want the bread

On my way to get Wonderbread
I swear I just want the bread
Mommy gave me a book of food stamps
Said ""Go get some bread and a pop and come back""
Get to the store, first thing I see
Arab dude just staring at me
Looking at me like I'm 'bout to steal
But really though dawg, you need to go chill
Grabbed what I needed, left out the do'
Two little boys in front of the sto'
Fiends running up, running through alleys
I kept on moving, nobody looked at me
Course some niggas stomped on my head
All because they wanted the bread

On my way to get Wonderbread

Dope Fiend Rental,Old ,2013,"Dried up blood on that baggie, I done scraped myself with that razor
Getting head in that trick house and I snuck out without paying her
Locked up in that precinct, used my Timberland for a pillow
Break the dank in that swizzle,
 
riding 'round in a dope fiend rental
Pulling up on ya baby momma, like bitch what you tryna get into?
If you ain't about that sucking, then ho you can keep on trucking
I'm getting mine straight up, no middle man, nigga I don't like you
Fool's Gold the clique,
 
and musically we don't fuck with you
Went from holding crack in my ass crack to racks on racks on ASCAP
Coulda rhymed ASCAP with ass capped, Jadakiss already said that
Do it for the days when for dinner,
 
all a nigga had to eat was a couple of conies
Broke as fuck and no bitch will fuck, in my basement, jerking off lonely
Used to fall off fucking with the work,
 
but guess what I'm back on ho
No more messing on that couch,
 
now I'm all the way in your bitch mouth
And I gag her 'til she cry, on her stomach fluid come up
I be fucking her face on the daily, you be kissing that bitch in the mouth

Like open wide, ho!
Open wide, ho!
Open wide, ho!
Just open wide, ho!

If I tell a bitch to do a flip in the air
Then land on my dick from the back
Look I ain't tripping, no, I ain't kidding
Have her licking my head like a cat
Now shut up bitch and get the Amber Rose
Come and let a young real nigga cut
But nah, bitch, this dick ain't free
So she copped my dick and then cuffed
Now come here chick and let me feed you nuts
Cum on her ass and have a lioness
How her mouth can be wide as her legs
My dick is long as the Brooklyn bridge
Hit it raw cause I'm with the shit
Gave her the pipe, said she need a fix
Gave you life, you can't believe the sight
Take the wood like a termite
Made a crash up at the turnpike
But it's a rental, I'll get another
Wonder if you got the gift from your mother
I used to play hoops with your brother
Even played a lil' house with your sister
She always call me daddy or mister mister
Why the  can do more than fist her
Too busy getting head, I ain't never kissed her
Beat the cheeks, I never missed a beat
I was screwed up on the couch so I skeet skeet
Ho can make an orgasm last a week
I'mma get her deep, she a masterpiece
Hell nah I don't love that bitch
Hell yeah, I'm gon' enjoy that bitch
But I hope my daughter don't be like this
But I know her momma know that shit exist

Like open wide, ho!

Open wide, ho!",https://genius.com/Danny-brown-dope-fiend-rental-lyrics

It's in my DNA, 'cause my moms like to get fucked up the same way
DNA, DNA 'cause my fam like to get fucked up the same way
DNA, DNA 'cause my fam like to get fucked up the same way

Waking up, drooling on Versace pillowcases
I ain't smoke an eighth a day,
 I might end up a mental patient
Terry cloth bathrobes, blunts and ashtrays
White wine in flute glass, early morning Saturdays
Food plates and grape Ape, crepes and OJ
Bitches swimming topless in Chlorine off morphine
Emails on iPads don't answer when phone rings
Text message full coming down on four beans
Everynight like a bachelor party in Sin City
Bitches sniffing coke off each other titties with rolled 50's
Life I live like Charlie Sheen and Rick James
Going hard till it ain't a dollar to my name
This that Triple X shit nigga, how ya feel?
Groupies like glam rock, poison logo pills
Sniffing molly off amps blond haired tramps
When I'm on my way to the stage every night I rage

It's in my DNA, 'cause my pops like to get fucked up the same way
It's in my DNA, 'cause my moms like to get fucked up the same way
DNA, DNA 'cause my fam like to get fucked up the same way
DNA, DNA 'cause my fam like to get fucked up the same way

Warhols all on the wall of the villa
Adderall popping got me jumping to ceiling
Perceived as a villian no sentiment in my sentence
For instance in instants they'll be calling forensics
If incidents occur remember these ain't just words
Go from talking shit to organs preserved
You soft serve rappers just hide behind your reverb
And even without effects you'll end up dessert
I research and homework, make you dig ya own dirt
On beats buried alive, ratting wiseguys
I'm with a Latin bitch, fat ass, well porportioned thighs
And love to see it cumming so I squirt it in her eyes
I'm hopping out that new shit like 
narcs on Tuesday
The grill on it shiny like LL Cool J's
What's on my waist could make a nigga meet ya doomsday
To describe ya mixtape– that shit was like a toothache

It's in my DNA, 'cause my pops like to get fucked up the same way
It's in my DNA, 'cause my moms like to get fucked up the same way

Party All the Time,XXX,2011,"Always wanna go
Always tell her ""yes,"" never tell her ""no""
Know you think you know everything, but you don't
Wanna do the right thing, but you probably won't
So you chase the night life, blinded by the lights
Bottom of the empty glass, where you find life
Always left behind, because she think she right
Thinking that she grown, but always need your advice
And always in a situation that she need your help
But wouldn't help another, only care about herself
In your VIP, asking, ""Where the drink at?""
Calling her a groupie, you think she really think that?
She just wanna hear that, ""That ass look right""
What you doing after this? Fuck tomorrow night
Wanna snort some blow? Pop a lot of pills?
Fucking, when the sun come up, she don't feel

She wanna party all the time
Party all the time
She wanna party all the time
She wanna party all the time
Party all the time
She wanna party all the time
She wanna party all the time
Party all the time
She wanna party all the time
She wanna party all the time
Party all the time
She wanna party all the time

Skip semester, classes've passed
Say she going back, but she ain't going back
'Cause time ain't waiting for a future on hold
At glass tables, on her knees, sniffing coke
Tell her get a hold, grip on life
Rather fill her cup up, liquor with no ice
Twice had an abortion; young, dumb and scorching
Rate that she going, she might be whoring
Signs she ignoring, but doesn't recognize
Blind to what's occurring, what's going in your mind?
Seven days a week, same shit every morning
Calling her a cab from different niggas' apartments
Wanting her to change, but she won't, dog
Just another number in her fucking call log
Lost in the fog, head in the smoke
Laughing at the world 'cause her life is a joke

She wanna party all the time
Party all the time
She wanna party all the time
She wanna party all the time
Party all the time
She wanna party all the time
She wanna party all the time
Party all the time
She wanna party all the time

Golddust,Atrocity Exhibition,2016,"Bust it open
Flake looking like gold dust
Nigga get a whiff of this uncut
Bloody Marys at brunch
From last night still drunk
Popped a Adderall nigga that was my lunch
And I gotta hunch
Roll another blunt
Call some hoes up nigga lets do some bumps
Caught up in the whirlwind
Life took a tail spin
Hid behind designer shades
Life of sin
Lost control
Don’t have a soul
Myself I don’t know no more
Numbing up with drugs
To suppress these feelings
Praying to the heavens
Letting these devils get the best of me
Nigga what’s the recipe for a good time
A whole lot of liquor while you doing coke lines
Residue on my mustache
How could it last
Roll a hundred dollar bill
Nigga blow cash

Can’t nobody tell me no
Nigga pass me that blow
Got to the point ain’t gotta buy drugs
Niggas just give to em to me
Yea they think they showing love
And that’s what’s up
Kinda fucked up
Now I do way it more then I use to
Have no clues
All the false alarms
Where most would've died
But my tolerance strong
Been cursed all along
Whole family addicts
Floating through my bloodstream
Like I gotta have it
Tried to quit a few times
But it didn’t work out
Can you understand
What my life is about
Cause I think you don’t
So take a step inside
A mind so horrific
Images that I hide
Take look inside
Scare you for life
This is the way
Nigga step inside

Mimosa for breakfast
With a thick hoe from Texas
Got good karma
Feel the persona
Got the Hermes towel while I'm up in the sauna
Smoking on ganja
Tasting like caramel
Ass so fat think she get it from her mama
Came along way hitting thots in spots
Now I fuck pornstars I done jerked off and watched
Spending racks up in  Bergdorf
Bitches take ya shirt off
Took a couple molly’s
Now they wanna have a twerk off
Guess who the judge
Why they hold the grudge
Me I done got it on my own out the mud
Will it all last
Will it all last
Roll a hundred dollar bill
Nigga blow cash
Will it all last
Will it all last
Roll a hundred dollar bill

Got my young, light-skinned ho rolling up the tree
Wearing jackets in the house, it's a Michigan winter
Boiling water on the stove, Ramen noodles for dinner
Dope fiends out the halfway house and they still sniffing
Homie mommy's 50, smoking and still tricking
Still talking shit with this loosie, I'm ash flicking
See my breath when I talk, but nigga, I ain't tripping
Landlord is, the nigga tryna put us out
Selling all the samples, can't afford to give 'em out
Just copped a half-track, see my nigga tryna get it
Standing on the baseline, Scottie Pippen pivot
Needles in they arms just to keep the lights on
Shit, fuck around, be on hardcore pawn
Tryna get this shit off, the window, we snuck in
Won't live for anything, but might die for nothing

They want that old Danny Brown
To bag up and sell a whole pound
Might have to go and get my braids back
Matter of fact, go and bring them AK's back
They want that old Danny Brown

In the Cutty same color as steak sauce
Eyeballed the work, but was just a .8 off
Vet in the game, first seed in the playoffs
Meet me at the Coney, gotta get this weight off
Balmains fitting like a nigga went swimming in 'em
I'm waxed and I'm shining, hardwood floor
Whore want it hardcore, squirt it on her jaw
Looking at the whore like ""What you came here for?""
Linwood nigga, heat on him, no stash box
Turn a gangbanger's bandana to a rag top
Old head, dope fiend, cooking up the yay
Young boys'll shoot your face for them Cartiers
Came a long way taking three for a nick'
Cop an 8 ball, tryna stack for the zip
Now I'm in the rap game, verse worth a brick
Fiends lining up for a hit of this shit
(And I reps that shit, right now and forever)

L'oiseau qui dormait en chacun de nous
S'élèvera

Hipster by heart but I can tell you how the streets feel
Everybody thirsty and they looking for a refill
If the gang eating, guns barking at your doggie bag
Get took out for your take out now you carry out
Murder by delivery,
 married at the paramount
I just coughed up a fair amount of niggas might air it out
Judge a book by cover so we never educated
It ain't about races, poor and rich segregated
Just to get the bacon dawg, you gotta go HAM
Use to be lost 'til I found who I am
But it took the hook to eat the palm on my hands
Locked tryna get real creative with the spam
Locked in a jam cause a nigga serve butter
Just to get a little bread had to keep the mayo smothered
All I really wanted was to overdub my vocals
But no one ever thought that I would take it past local
High a'top a totem man somebody shoulda told 'em
That if money grow on trees being rich is dime a dozen

So I'm smoking by my lonely
By my goddamn self, I don't need your help, homie
Cause don't nobody really know me
Said nobody really know me

See that's going on a limb
And I used to sell trees, and I used to rock Timbs
Radiohead shit, fiends with the Bends
Back when Granny used to tell me ""Stay Out of In""
Letting the cold air out, tryna know my whereabouts
Gone for three days and nobody ever heard about
How I got these Jordans, but that ain't too important
When I got a bitch pregnant and I'm stacking for abortion
And all I really wanted was to give myself a portion
Lit up off the Henny got a nigga self absorbing
Smoking on a bogie, no bud style, who can I trust now?
Lady snitch and got the whole block down
Now we gon' eat now, no rebound
When your boxed out, belly of the beast now
Now you got me feeling trapped and I can't look back
When the road ahead is gold and the past is made of ash
And I'm going through the trash tryna find a little treasure
Living for the better tryna get myself together

Float On,Old ,2013,"Backwood of that good to the pain for the brain
A cup of lean for me to sleep, see I be going through thangs
Music business got me stressed Xanax to maintain
Waking up on wrong sides got me writing in vain
Vicodin to numb me up help me cope with the struggle
Remember praying to get in there saying rap to my brothers
And now I, got the whole world listening
Give your ear for a second a life changing decision
Every other minute thoughts run through my mind
'bout how bad I wanted this but I cannot waste time
So I'm trapped in the beat, stuck on every line
Nothing else matters, except my next rhyme
You can never understand all the pressure I'm against
Getting high thinking how to make it better than your last shit

Might have a mental breakdown
If it wasn't for these pills here now
And no matter how it gets I hold on
Rolling up this dope to cope I float on, nigga I float on

Let's go, hop up in the Chevy four-door
Let's roll (I float on)

Remember back when mommy sent me for the Wonder Bread
And niggas jumped me stomped on my fucking head
It's like I learned right then you either sink or you swim
And to beat your enemy, you gotta think like them
So I was up late breaking day with the gremlins
Music in my heart but my thoughts wouldn't listen
Hood outta bye-bye cause rap shit was sci-fi
So I'm tormented with the things I seen with these eyes
Can't get a wink 'less I'm leaning off of syrup
Dreaming of my past like a nightmare so I wake up
Staring at the ceiling with this feeling that won't go away
Until the verse is done wrote all day but them shit's throwaway
So I'm breaking day sniffing Adderall writing
And not for the money for the life after dying
Pray I get old just to hear I been the future
Just to see my influence in this genre of music

And might make it to see somehow
If it wasn't for these pills here now
And no matter how it gets I hold on

Just lean back, and get it, don't stop licking til you tell me ""quit it""
Let me suck on that clit while you follow my head
Baby girl, I know you're with it
Ball with me, fall back on that or fantasize
And I love your thighs I can't deny
Work it like Twerk team and I think my dick want to be inside
Rolling balls 'til my dick hard, didn't say heard like a missed call
I don't really look like I'm tryna fuck
And I probably won't care about her tomorrow
Damn it ho, what you tryna do ""Pour a deuce lets get chopped and screwed""
Fool's Gold, and you know, and Balmain mark down the shit
Smoking on that Frieza, nigga, got a nigga amnesia, nigga
Comatose and I need a dose, wanna get behind that ass you got
Dipping to that Diplo, throw it right when they play tonight
Looking right, thinking of dimes and I think I am gon' fuck her tonight
She lookin' ready to go, and fosho ain't gon stop
With her hands on the floor and her feet on the wall

Pop the pussy on a hand stand, hand stand
Pop the pussy on a hand stand, hand stand

Pop the pussy on a hand stand, hand stand
Pop the pussy on a hand stand, hand stand

And she pop that pussy like she ain't afraid to fall

Let me see what you're working with, don't stop girl keep twerking it
I'm watching you and I'm wondering if you could do that with my dick in it
She throw it back like a fire ball, hit it up, order like a house call
Want to eat the cat, beat from the back, then give that ho a mouthful
Hundred dollar pills we rolling, ass in the air she working
Don't care when we rolling, don't care when we rolling
Hundred dollar pills we rolling, ass in the air she working
Don't care when we rolling, don't feel when we rolling
Pop the pussy on hand stand, record that on my Handycam
That uncut, Ludacris, feel that monkey I go Orangutan
You ain't met a nigga like this before, eat it from the back, suck on ya toes
The way I put my mouth on it, that pussy was under a mistletoe
Throw it back to that A-Trak, one hour to that Baauer
Now she got my dick hard, and I want to fuck her in the shower
Looking ready to go, oh for sure, I ain't go soft

Torture,Old ,2013,"Dawg

Remember one time dawg, this fiend owed the boss
Put peanut butter on her pussy, let his pits lick it off
Back when I was living on Flanders
Seen another dope fiend beat another with a hammer
Remember at the park, seen a nigga at the payphone
Got rocked in his dome,
 
momma picked me up and ran home
Was like fucking seven years old
When I first seen a fiend try to light a rock off the stove
Damn near burned his top lip off,
 
so my mind ticked off
Desensitized to a lot of things, mind would drift off
Wish it was what I seen on TV
I snapped outta that,
 
unc' beating on my auntie
Gunshots outside was sorta like fireworks
We know they ain't fireworks, it's December 21st
Cold winter with a kerosene heater
On the couch so cold, can't take off your sneakers

And it's torture
Look in my mind and see the horrors
All the shit that I've seen, nigga it's torture
Look in my mind and see the horrors
All the shit that I've seen, nigga it's torture
Look in my mind and see the horrors
All the shit that I've seen

I feel like a, prisoner of war
Reacting sporadically to what the mind absorb
Probably need a shrink,
 
can't get a wink
So I smoke a lot of kush and pop a Xanax to sleep
Close my eyes, look up, fiend said 1 for 8
Can tell that I scared him by the look on my face
Reached in my pocket, served him nervous as a surgeon
Can't believe where I'm at, 'posed be writing verses
Heard a knock at the door, 'nother fiend wanted fo'
Gave him what he came for, told him go to the sto'
Let me get a box of Swishers, 
Faygo Cola
Gave his ass another stone, now guess what, it's over
He ain't come back, before I could look back
I heard the wood on the door crack
And they yelling ""Police!""
With this work up in my jeans, man this a bad dream

And it's torture
Look in my mind and see the horrors
All the shit that I've seen, nigga it's torture
Look in my mind and see the horrors
All the shit that I've seen, nigga it's torture

Hell for It,Atrocity Exhibition,2016,"Holy spirit
When I look
I cannot see
Reflection in the mirror
Broke bread with the Judas
And I think I see it clearer
These niggas want what’s mine
But I be damn if I’m a give up
Stuck up in the hood
Praying rap would get me out
Momma ‘bout to lose her house
Gotta figure this shit out
Use to catch the bus to 12th
Just to hustle for some Prada
In the kitchen with my uncle
Beat the pot like a piñata
Baraka wit the product
Use to hide it in my closet
Type of shit
That have a fiend
Crawling on his carpet
Walking over carcasses
Of artists in my garden
Nice with the bars
Even the beat begs my pardon
Got me mistaken
Muslim salami bacon
Always on the defense
So it’s no offense taken
I’m smoking on them raisins
From the bay they taste amazing
Cajun kicking flavor
All the time
Not on occasion
Would be amazed
All the time I heard I wouldn’t make it
I was writing shit that was so damn amazing
When half these little niggas was still watching
That’s so raven
I was out there hustling
Scraping up and saving
Just to catch a 12 hour bus to NY
Sleeping on the floor in studios
Asking God why
But never got deterred
From the voice I heard inside
Tell myself everyday
The greatest that’s alive

And I'm a give em hell for it
Until it's heaven on earth
My nigga
I'm a give em hell for it
For whatever it’s worth
My nigga
I'm a give em hell for it
Unless death come first
My nigga
I’m a give em hell for it
For whatever it’s worth
My nigga
I'm a give em hell

Cause we living in that
Actavis double cups was addicted to that
Had them demons on my back
Was escaping through that
Blamed everybody but myself
Apologies for that
So they hold a nigga back
For the way that I act
People scared of doing business
Thinking I smoke crack
I react immature
To anyone talking smack
Cause where I'm from respect
The only thing that you have
Grew up virtually poor
Realities unmasked
So my task
Is inspire your future with my past
I lived through that shit
So you don’t have to go through it
Stepping stones in my life
Hot coals
Walk with me
Listen when I speak
Every time talk with me
Couple screws loose
You don't wanna start
With me
Got it from Motown
Feel David Ruffin pain
Wanna cry right now            
So I’m wishing that it rain
Cause I’m knowing I’m the best
They compare skills to sales
Tell myself everyday
Know this shit ain’t real
Radio don’t make you ill
They get a hit a they feel they self
Respect for lyricism
In this game ain’t none left
Have a bitch like Iggy
Think she sicker than me
And that’s so fucked up
That’s just how this shit be
I just wanna make music
Fuck being a celebrity
Cause these songs that I write
Leave behind my legacy

And I'm a give em hell for it
Until it's heaven on earth
My nigga
I'm a give em hell for it
For whatever it’s worth
My nigga
I'm a give em hell for it
Unless death come first

I'm a give em hell for it

Gotta watch they mouth
When them guns come out
And them shots ring out

Watch what they say
Watch what they do
When a hook come around
Them kids come down
They a tell on you
It’s snakes in the grass
Getting trapped by rodents
Potent we smoking
A leave you choking
Hoping you focused
So dog take notice
For a flash of light
Run you off light roaches
Hopping off porches
With chrome 44
Nose long as song
Made by Mike Bolton
Lightning bolts
Rip through your torso
Raining blood
After that thunder
Mommas crying
Children wonder
But this is the life
That we all succumbed to
Make a nigga wanna go
And cut his phone off
Cops killing niggas everyday
Like protocol
Watch the TV
Turn on the news
Make a nigga feel like
He listened to blues
In the hood
Wit that Arm & Hammer
Getting them Pampers
For baby mama
Hood flick us
We in the slammer

Ornette with a fortress
Scorching frontos on porches
Torching up the purple

I'm Coltrane on Soul Plane
Propane flow game
Bitches know my name from
Cancun to Spokane
Got it in my carry on
Smoke it till its all gone

Tommy Dorsey on my trombone
Hit the greenery jaws go Gillespie
Have a nigga shaking like he got epilepsy
I hit it twice then i pass it to the right

Want the stress to go away
Just rollup
Take the pain away

Ya car acting up
You need new tires

Yo landlord knocking
Her girl cock blocking

Living in this world
Always on the edge

Smoke one to the head
Pockets on e

Fields,XXX,2011,"Money talk only broke people listen
Ain't gotta pot to piss in can't afford to pay attention
These unfamiliar niggas be expecting recognition
Respect the intellect let me continue on the mission
I used to walk through alleys, paths in the field
You know that one house where Kenneth use to live?
Now it's just another shortcut to the store
The TV in the window drew the line of what was rich and poor
Mommy gave me food stamps told me buy wonder bread
On the way these niggas jumped me, left me wit' knots on my head
Went to school yesterday and to had leave early
'Cause niggas said they was gon' jump me at 3:30
All because I lived in the hood who they had beef with
And I ain't never tell 'em, dog, I kept that shit a secret
But I can't really trip, niggas looked out for me
Them same niggas played me ain’t around to tell the story
I'm just young nigga on the D.O.T
With my headphones on and sack full of weed
Rhymes in my head thought nobody wanted to hear em
So I had the fiends hitting rocks like the Pilgrims

And where I lived, it was house, field, field
Field field, house
Abandoned house, field, field

That nigga much sicker
That's why he pop pills, sip lean, smoke swishers
Yeah, I'm doing drugs thought I never ever try
That had my eyes so dry, dog I wish I could cry
I'm fucking bad foreign bitches while you in the hood
Smoking on some dirt weed smelling like some fire wood
Sitting on porches of abandoned houses
Or sitting in the field on bed bug ridden couches
It's like they all forgot man nobody care about us
That why we always end up in prison instead of college
Living in the system working kitchen for chump change
Lost in the streets niggas playing that gun game
Where nobody wins just a bunch of mommas losing
Dead body in the field, nobody heard the shooting
We living in the streets where the options is limited
'Cause it's burnt building instead of jobs and businesses

And where I lived, it was house, field, field
Field field, house
Abandoned house, field, field
And where I lived, it was house, field, field

Long-ass cutty, eating lots of shrimp, got a wig and bring it back
She go in and bring it back and make that booty go *clap-clap*
Ain't no way gonna sleep with a whitey, rob my nigga, ho so furry
Ghetto Bill Murray, that's a whole 'nother story

Put this in your nose, ho, then start sniffing
Put this on your tongue, ho, then start licking
Y'all niggas shrooming, y'all better fall back

Drop the lights when I drop the jewel,
 roll up bush and call it blue groovy

From the Ground,Atrocity Exhibition,2016,"8 balls wit a safety pin
I deserve the finer things
Told myself back then
When I used to ride a Schwinn
Now I'm on a tour bus
Going places I ain't never been
Wrote my rhymes down on a paper bag
That was way back
Having dreams of a Cadillac
Dog, I had to bounce back
Locked a nigga up
Why they do me like that?
Now I'm on the Jack in the county
Asking mommy for some money
Swear to God she'd do anything for me
Now we out the hood and the nightmare is us going back
So I won't go to sleep 'til I finish that
Cousin of death anyway
Now I see better day
And I ain't tryna miss a minute, second hour
Living on borrowed time
Can't think about tomorrow
'cause it's about today
And you know you wanna take my place
Let's get it

You turn around, and now I'm winning
I built it up, from the ground
You stay asleep, I'm gonna get it
I built it up, from the ground

Now tell me, would you sacrifice your dreams?
What it takes if you want anything
Got me missing sleep 'cause my mind on the beat
So while I'm counting bars y'all be counting sheep
No cheat sheet, get it out the mud
Get it how you live, why I'm out here in the field
My nigga wake up, wipe the cold out your eyes
It's a cold, cold world but even hotter when you die
So no try to do, what about you?
Work off, well met, do the same thing too
A lot locked up wishing they was like you
Got a letter from my nigga saying he be out in June
Been down for a minute and every since sentence
Things ain't been the same so I'm missing my nigga
Staring at the ceiling thinking how far I came
Was trapped in the storm but I made it out the rain

You turn around, and now I'm winning
I built it up, from the ground
You stay asleep, I'm gonna get it
I built it up, from the ground",https://genius.com/Danny-brown-from-the-ground-lyrics
Greatest Rapper Ever,The Hybrid ,2010,"My homie a magician with the Tec
Make your chain disappear and reappear on his neck
I ain't tricking with you hoes, but shit don't ask him
Only thing I give a bitch? A fucking orgasm
I'll throw you in the river, hands tied tight
Watch your ass drown, feel it in the air tonight
I'm spitting that dope shit, smoking on regulars
Writing 16's like internet child predators
Rocking that 10 Deep, but I stay dolo
You wearing polo, who are you, Young Dro?
I'm fifth floor at the Bellagio
Vegas bitches that's resembling Rosario
Dawson, awesome, hit the head, Mario
Sorry yo, my tongue long, she squirted off the sheets
She gave me that Becky, I gave her that yoshi
The only time you niggas touch keys is Motif
Go and sell a beat, you never sold a rock
Still be sitting on the couch if I was signed to Koch
Coulda signed to the Roc, nah, I'm signed to the streets
The D is the only thing that's profiting for me
Feeling like Big Meech, when we're 'bout to cook up
But not the one from B.M.F. dog, the one from Lynwood
It ain't a nigga I know
Three years straight, three dollar blows
Good any hood, anywhere I go I'm straight
Nigga hit me with a hundred cause the look on my face
Momma, I'm honored to be your son
Could snatch a stack of stamps out and not rip a single one
Used to be in a rush, to finish off my sack
I was so thirsty dog, sold a pregnant bitch crack
Let her pay me extra, smoke it in the back, then she came back
Titties out smacking herself on the back, talking 'bout
Something crawling on her, looking like the world's falling on her
And I pushed it, you rub the foots of the bitches I mushed
Funky ass cutlass three deep, blowing kush, North got her shook
Started reading when the judge threw the fucking book
But the block was off the hook, said ""Fuck class!""
Off them same pills that had Carlton dancing fast
Young buck, look, now a grown up
Now I pop them same pills, listening to Donuts
I rap like I bet my life
Cause in all actuality, nigga I did
You rap like you used to hit the pipe
Nah nigga that ain't crack, that's crackhead shit
Rep that shit, will tell a bitch
You wouldn't break a brick, you ain't seeing this dick
You trick on the bitch, dog you ain't rich
Take a bitch to the movies, take her to the crib

Big butt, slim waist, and her hair long
Pass it down to me like a heirloom
The Henny got me wetter than whale piss
I die for this shit like Elvis
Boss up and shake down
Get it jumpin' like a techno breakdown
Night young and we just gettin' started
Let me walk on yard at the Bruiser Brigade party
Got smoke, of course
Goin' up, fireworks on the Fourth
Take mine, and I do it with force
Been with this shit since I jumped off the porch
Used to chop grams on my Grandma's faucet
Pay me what it costs, I ain't tryna hear offers
Tryna play Brown, you be hangin' with Hoffman
Copped a pound and I broke it down in ounces
Bust it open like them hoes came in
Got more pills than the Olsen twins

Tripped over the crack, crippled by circumstance
Nigga gotta face the facts, make this world your own
Sun sprinkled light for this mega-marathon
Tryna live on through my music
The future influence, the next to do it
The odds are against you, kiddo
Life want everything from you, like a divorced widow
Tryna get it like the next negro
Want beef? You gon' fuck around and end up a vegetable
Tryna give you a lil' game

Hook jumpin' out them vans, throw us on pavement
Locked up with dirty white boys, all musty
Prayin' for probation, hope I get lucky
Court-appointed lawyers, gotta stay coppin'
Put you in predicament, but that's your only option
Sink or swim, look at him in the system
Just another nigga, one-way ticket to a prison
Tried to help, only hurt in the end
How the fuck 'posed to take care your kids from the pen'?

Some don't know how to stick to the code
Nobody to trust, that's the way life goes

Clean Up,Old ,2013,"No matter how much I implore

The thoughts are cloudy
In the marijuana sky, but it started raining molly
It got me feeling sorry while I'm feeling on myself
Cause I don't know this bitch name but I'm feeling on her breast
I know it ain't right, but in this state I don't care
A whole week went past, I ain't gone nowhere
Hotel rooms crushing pills and menus
Daughter sending me messages saying ""Daddy, I miss you""
But in this condition I don't think she need to see me
Ain't slept in four days, and I'm smelling like seaweed
Problems in my past haunt my future and the present
Escaping from reality got me missing my blessings
Sent a couple G's but that make it no better
And now I got habits that ain't getting no better
And it ain't that easy tryna get all together
Been stressed for so long, think depression done set in

It's time for me to clean it up
I came too far to fuck it up, like

Pops left mom when I was only 18
So rightfully that meant I had to be the man of things
And by 28, mom was damn near homeless
And now I'm 31, she 'bout to fucking cop her own shit
Triple beam dreams brought me nothing but nightmares
Thought that I was helping but the system don't fight fair
Cases had me locked up, mama always wrote me
Pops my only visit, they the only ones that loved me
That's why I feel bad, popping Givenchy tags
Knowing that this tee could feed my nephew for a week
For material I'm weak, acting like I don't care
I spend it all on clothes, then something is wrong there
I sent my mom some G's, but that makes it no better
Cause now I got habits that ain't getting no better
And it ain't that easy tryna get it all together

Slow days, fast days, getting paper any way
Slow days, fast days, getting paper any way
Slow days, fast days, getting paper any way

It's the same old shit
Everybody in the manor is locked up, boxed up
It's killing me, niggas wanna get rid of me
Cause I lyrically bust on the riddim, fill the room with humidity
Stick it in a manner, the heaviest rhythm banging out
Doubling my money getting my hustle in Canning Town
Listen up Danny Brown, I been doing this thing
Skipped in, then I come and lyrically assist 'em
(I had my dubs on the step)
I never stopped cause I sit in the booth, flipping the truth
While you're running and chatting, thinking you're realer than Screw
You ain't so why you act, dummy, you think you bad, well that's funny
I'm tryna get Maybach money, I'm a Mac Miller, spitting A$AP Rocky

I had them dubs on the step",https://genius.com/Danny-brown-dubstep-lyrics
ODB,UnKnown,2013,"Take another hit and I pass out, rapping like I’m assed out
Sneaking bitches up, when granny passed out
So ho, what that ass 'bout?
 
No I ain’t going to cash out
 
before a little fame
You could get that ass mashed out
, bitch I’m on that cash route
Ain’t looking for a rest stop
They talk about modelling, might say I need a head shot
I need a dollar for everyone born out of wedlock
Tryina make the bread stop, calling up the dreadlocks
Bitch, I’m 'bout my peso, hablo dinero
And your bitch want me to go TP on her bung-hole
I got these rap niggas saying ""Uncle""
While I beep-beep, pull on the hair of a Rapunzel
Think about me and masturbate with the faucet
Bout to take the game and put that bitch up in the closet

But in the end I’m just a dirty old man
With a pill in my mouth and my dick in my hand

Mind of a pervert with words I submerge
On the verge of O.D'in for the shit that I say
But who gives a fuck, I'm still gon' do this shit anyway
A dirty nigga from Detroit at the end of the day
So when the night fall I be gettin' head in the alley
By a low down nothing
 2 dollar skully
Let her use her own rubber, bullshit trojan
Dick too big, nigga I was stuffed in
Bitch I'm David Ruffin and ruffles no stuffing
Bundles of Peruvian snow with his shirt tucked in
Lookin' at the rest of you artist like you're nothing
Know that I'm the shit so I don't say shit
But when these rappers rap, dog they don't say shit
And I'm George Carlin,
 fucked a June in August",https://genius.com/Danny-brown-odb-lyrics

Right up in the same pot unc' cooked the rock
Went from flippin' on mats to flippin' them sacks
Hide and seek, send spots to out on, we sell crack, facts
War on drugs was a chess game
Was a pawn, guns drawn on my front lawn
Just a young nigga, starin' down the corner
Checkin' out the hustlers with the latest kicks on 'em
Know a nigga want, mama ain't got it
Fuckin' up in school, lyin', what she know about it?
I was just a young nigga, know what I was headed for
Jumped off the porch, really, I wasn't ready for it
Get up out the hood, find a way out
Route I'm on, either death or jail house
Wanna get away from all this stress

After lockdown in the county, smoking squares with my bunkie

Used to bag up the weed and live off of the coke
By myself in the spot and I never got lonely

Caught the bus with some stacks, and I kept the heater on me

Momma smoking nightmares chasing her pipe dream
Hard to give advice behind a monitored call

School become a free meal,
 
streets become a cheap thrill
Same prices pa paid, he gon' pay a cheap deal
Hourglasss empty but he looking for a refill
Revolver break dancing,
 
yeah, he make that bitch windmill
Guess he's just a psycho in the city of the Chrysler
Everybody living spiteful nigga looking just to ice you
So we living hostile just to cop some Aeropostale
Trenchcoat Mafia, for a lil' Hollister
Gotta get his dollars up, so we hit the dice game
Lost all his re-up, now he rob the dice game
Probation violation call his ass the son of Satan
Got these old niggas scared, like it's Crystal Lake and Jason
Cause they been through cases, they ain't tryna go back
Fresh meat up on the street, he give a fuck about that
Snatching Cartie's downtown, wear 'em same damn week
Tryna get the same bitches on the same damn street
Rob a ho-ass nigga at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time

And fuck with some hoes at the mall
For that shit, he wished it all, baby face and all
My lil' nigga gotta ball, lil' nigga gotta ball
Run up on you where that money at, fuck nigga after that
Lean in that double cup, lil' nigga screwed up
Pop a pill nigga and he don' feel nigga
You do it in the song, he do it for real nigga
And all his OG's is either dead or in prison
Scared to talk to him like, fuck it, he won't listen
Unnecessary shit, thinking that he has to
A pair of True Religions dog, my lil nigga blast you

I'm playing ping pong with your bitch' jaws
You the type to have a sing-along in Superman drawers
I got a redhead ho, I call her Molly Ringwald
She like to take a lot of Molly and bring Adderall
Sipping white wine till the sunset
Before it got dark she already got naked
Necked her for a second, then she got reckless
Rump shaker, wrecks and FX'd it
Bum, stickity bum, stickity bum, Das EFX'ed it
Left her bum sticky, fell asleep on the terrace
Me on the beat, that's a hate crime
With black ink, I murder white lines (Baseline)

Your flow's atrocious, the amount of weed I smoke is copious
Eyes red like Soviet, dog, you're on some bogus shit
These novice poets are not my associates
Ferocious, but the flows inappropriate
But if you approach this they might call encroachment
I'm so bent, oh shit, got your bitch soaking
I ain't Clarence Carter but, bitch, I be stroking
Ho, are you outta your mind?
I tell a bitch like this, ""You are not that fine""
I don't give a bitch shit, no, not a dime
But bitch, for you, I ain't even got time

Catching clouds smelling like the green giant underarm

A weedhead with words more potent than what I'm smoking
This ain't no Reggie caught the plane ride from Oakland
I used to play with pistols in crackhouses
Skipping school just to fuck bitches on dirty couches, abandoned houses
Find one with the lights on it
Landlord came pulled the hook, now it's locks on it

Passing round 40's, brown paper bags
Rolling up a swisher while this rat freak a black
It ain't about nothing, but let me hold something
Ate a lunchable for dinner, nigga I ain't fronting
Caught the bus to East land, just to walk around it
Ain't buy nothing nigga, just walked around it
Looked at some hoes, I ain't even holler

Shake and roll like a craps game in a Las Vegas casino

She take a dip, then take a sip, then dip dip dip
All I wanna do is make her ride this dick
Bouncing on that ass while she biting on her lip
Really wanna grab it when she look back at it
With a look on her face like she just did magic
Jeans on cost about eighteen hundred
Pop a little pill so you know I stay blunted
Blowing that sticky now it's time to get freaky
Take a dip in the back, rubber gun in my pinky
Tanga got me rolling, thing she keep on, woah
No way that I'm controlling so I gotta put a cheat code
We smoking on that potent, drinking on that potion
She turnt up, hopped in her hand stand, bounced that ass in slow motion

I said oh no, my God, little mama be twerking hard
When she back that thang, then she clapped that thang, she for sure got my dick hard

And I just wanna take ya home and wear you out
Head for free, no cashing out
Eating on your pussy, got you squirting on your blouse
Hit it from the back on the living room couch
You want a thing that your man won't do
Before you bust one bitch you gotta bust too
Run around to got to do what it do cause I just did me so you gotta do you
Don't stop girl keep twerking it

Four bad hoes in my hotel room
Fucking on the pillows while I sleep til noon
Tripping on the molly and start to go party with a big, fat pussy 
Ain't no way ya'll fuckin with this, ain't fuckin with this

Six months rehab, but she's back at it
Reflexion stare at it, but she can't look at it
She wiped out the debit card, owing on the credit
For student loans, they call her phone, but she don't sweat it
Cocaine on counter tops, separate in lines
Everytime she do it, she says this her last time
Chasing that high from the very first time
Back in her dorm room in 2009
Never thought this relationship would come this far
Rolled singles in her nose, 
I'm blade sniffing hard
In night club stalls, her and her friends sniff it all
Never sleep in random dude's apartments, missed calls
Unreplied texts from her boyfriend

Cheat you out a couple bucks on some dope fiend shit

Got a school closed down, and I think we should hit it
Just waiting on my unc' to get back from the clinic
And we gon' go over there to see what's up with it

Dog, remember when I was struggling? Caught the bus 'cause I was hustling
Used to stack up to go to Hudsons, hid the work from my older cousin
Hit my shit like it wasn't nothing, knew I wouldn't fight him so said fuck it

My pockets on dummy, they say I'm acting funny
Shouldn't've never gave my black ass no money

Now I'm blowing on the best kush, shit be fucking my lungs up
Two packs of Newports a day and I used to just buy loosies though
Hoes all on my dick, them hoes ain't wanna fuck before
But still I fucked them bitches, but I just never call no more
I'm all up in your liquor cabinet, drinking whatever up in the bitch
Took too many pills, now I'm throwing up in your toilet, I'm like aww, shit
I'm in the house of hip hop, with my mothafuckin' feet on the table
Ran the phone bill up on the phone sex line and I even ordered porn on the cable
Give a nigga from my hood a thousand, he'll treat it like a hundred thousand
Nigga, public assistance housing, mice all up in your closet
Keeping it G ain't bout where you from, it's about where you gon' be
'Cause ain't shit sweet when you living on the street and there's roaches crawling on your cheek

My pockets on dummy, they say I'm acting funny
Shouldn't've never gave my black ass no money",https://genius.com/Danny-brown-shouldnt-of-lyrics
#HottestMC,Adrift ,2013,"Fuck any rapper rappin' if the nigga ain't dappin'
Show respect, I'm the greatest - old shit, I killed your latest
I don't give a fuck if you've got a billion dollars
Your rhymes are cheap, you release a poor product
You a servant in my world, the rap gods curse you
When judgement day's upon you, reality's a virtue
I walked a thousand miles recitin' a hundred rhymes
Brought smiles to faces, braced, labels owe me from lines
I don't give a fuck, a dirty Detroit nigga
Ain't-got-the-bud-but-show-up-with-a-ol-Swisher-ass nigga
Say ""bitch, I'm still hungry"", they actin' like I made it
I ain't make it 'til my mama fuckin' sittin' on some acres
I'm a motherfuckin' threat in the booth, these niggas know
Poet of the century, decades later they quote it
Deserve a Nobel Peace Prize for what I recite
Incite a riot with the speech, I'm Detroit Red on ecstasy
Sores on my scalp cause my last perm burnt me
Hair straight, jumpin' head first in an orgy
With a pool of blonde hoes, sniffin' on that white shit
So much caucasian pussy, startin' to think that I'm mixed
But I be writing that shit, have you rappers pissed
Like, ""How'd he think of this? I wish I'd thought of that shit""
Rhymes so real thought I wrote it in Janis Joplin's vomit
With the mic GG Allin wiped his ass with

I carry the cross for all my niggas lost but findin the rhyme
Days of no sunshine like a maze in my mind
No enter or exit, Adderall anorexic
Pill-poppin' dyslexic, naughty nature Treach shit
I think about my next line like you think of the next dime
I'm the future and the present, same damn time
An OG told me ""only nice as your last bar""
So with that said, suck my dick all y'all
The Motor City where motor mouths get impounded
I'm overseas, Australia, lookin' for the blondest
Ksubi jeans, and Ann Demeulermeester
And she like my shoes so I put it in her kiester
It's the hybrid like I wrote it in papyrus
Keep the shit on me, nigga, hood rat baby diaper
They heatin' up Caprice like a DC sniper
Raised off of hot dogs, down the middle slice em'
I’m hotter than Andre Rison with Left Eye
Rest in peace, baby, but no TLC in my life
And when I reach my fate, and I'm standin' at the gates
Know that God'll be proud, sayin' ""Daniel, you was great""
But you other niggas? 'Pac said he want an explanation
Big turned in his grave, an earthquake in Grenada
When Pun shed a tear it hurricane for a week
When Big L get upset and start tornadoin' trees",https://genius.com/Danny-brown-hottestmc-lyrics

Mind of a master,

Heart?of a king

The devil and an?angel on my shoulder when I speak
Lost in the streets, found on the beat
Still kept a clip, asked, and got it for cheap
Now I'm in the world where they pray for the weak
Stand-up niggas take shots to the knees
Lord, have mercy, pray for me
Need to calm down, so pass me the weed
Got me stressed out, situations look bleak
Time's runnin' out, how'd my days turn to weeks?

Up all night, toss and turn when I sleep
Pacing around, drowning sorrows in my drink
Can't even think, got my mind wrapped up
But I still bite down, clench my teeth, knuckle up

I'ma keep goin', you cannot blame us
Never look back, I would never change up
Never look back, I would never change up
Never look back, I would never change up
I'ma keep goin', you cannot blame us
Never look back, I would never change up
Never look back, I would never change up
Never look back, I would never

Every other day, always some shit
I'm the underdog but I'm never over it
Gotta keep a grip when the rent due
Niggas tryna get you for every last cent
Ain't no pretend, ain't tryna make amends
Just tryna keep my legacy, I'm legend in the end
So never try the scene, 'cause you could get bent
'Cause I protect mine from beginning to the end
Lord, have mercy, pray for me
Distanced from my friends, enemies close to me
Gotta stay at work, things change in a blink
Gotta stay woke, they all in a deep sleep

Talk a?good game, Trey Wingo
Speak in code so nobody know the lingo
Life like a dice game, ain't no casino
Street life, contra, ain't no cheat code
Everyday on the line like a free throw
Shit weak, like the knees on D. Rose
I was taught, ""Look out for your people""
Meet Heaven and you gotta know evil
Heart of a lion, eye of a eagle
Life a movie, but ain't no sequel
Switch lanes in that new thing
Got on that red line while I'm playing Flock of Seagulls
So, no way we could ever be equal
In the hay stack, I was that needle
Hold it in, thinkin' no one will believe you
Lose it all in a second, like #MeToo
The whole world is evil
Gun shots echo, never be peaceful
Smokin' diesel to forget it all
If I don't do nothin', I'ma ball

Ayy (Ayy), gotta get what's mine
Ayy (Ayy), before I lose my mind
Ayy (Ayy), like I'm runnin' out of time
Ayy (Ayy), shine light, man, shine (Shine)

Break down, lock down, run up on a ball (Nothing that you used to)
Standing on the corner, if you see me, I'ma ball
Break down, lock down, run up on a ball (Nothing I can pass to walk alone)
Standing on the corner, if you see me, I'ma ball
Break down, lock down, run up on a ball (Shinin' on myself, so)
Standing on the corner, if you see me, I'ma ball
Break down, lock down, run up on a ball (Nothing can break down the simple floor)
Down on the corner, if you see me, I'ma ball

Ayy, gotta ball 'til you fall
In a system that's designed, one strike, take it all
Ayy, all it take, one call
Pray you lose it all, one second, all gone
Ayy, know you feelin' all alone
But who can you turn to when things go wrong?
Ayy, it's the plot all along
Push you down the wrong path, the statistics have shown
Everything that I known turned out to be lies
Found out when I was grown so I shared that light
On these dark undertones, had a nigga head gone
Why they buy the diamonds and the car with shiny chrome
My fault, all alone in the scheme of it all
Played like a bong, had to stay strong
Got my head above water, had to keep movin' on
Had my head above water, had to keep movin' on

Ayy (Ayy), gotta get what's mine
Ayy (Ayy), before I lose my mind
Ayy (Ayy), like I'm runnin' out of time

Standing on the corner, if you see me, I'ma ball
Break down, lock down, run up on a ball (Nothing can break down the simple floor)
Down on the corner, if you see me, I'ma ball

The dream is realized, my heart skips a beat
I'm tyin' my feet, the baby can't sleep
Defeat the sun, reach, the furthest relax
The weed is uncertain, why men attacked
Facts is unlocked, dress is untied
Mind could explode, time to cut ties",https://genius.com/Danny-brown-shine-lyrics

Statements on Giving Up Lean,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Tim Westwood: 
Now, you've given up the syrup
, why is- the syrup down the sink. Why's that?
Danny Brown: 
I was getting too fat, man, I gained like fifteen pounds.
Tim Westwood: For real?
Danny Brown: Yeah, 
I like wearing Balmain jeans
 
and Rick Owens t-shirts.
 
You can't wear Rick Owens looking pregnant, you know what I'm saying?
 You can't have the Gucci Mane belly, man, to wear high-end fashion, you know what I'm saying? So one of 'em had to go.
Tim Westwood: Yeah, yeah, and for real, I mean, Gucci brought that little fucking belly into fashion, uh, why he continued it, the -
Danny Brown: 
You know, that look cool when you wear Coogi t-shirts and stuff, but once you start putting on
 -
Tim Westwood: 
Tight shit, then you look like a skinny little fat guy.
Danny Brown: yes and it's the worst.
Tim Westwood: So why was syrup making you fat?
Danny Brown: It's the sugar, you're drinking a lot of sugar. 
I might drink a 2-liter of soda a day by myself.
 That's just too much soda to be drinking a day.
Tim Westwood: Coming off the syrup, how long did you feel it took to get your mind off of it?
Danny Brown: About two weeks. I mean your stomach is just real fucked up. That's what's so nasty about it, everyone's talking about sipping syrup but if you don't have syrup for three days your might shit on yourself.
Tim Westwood: Oh it's that bad?
Danny Brown: You can't hold it. It's diarrhea. But then, this is the other side is if you drink too much, you become constipated and you can't take a shit. That's why Gucci Mane's belly was like that, it wasn't that he was fat it's that he was bloated. There was mad turds up in there.
Tim Westwood: He was backed up!
Danny Brown: This is true though. So it's nasty, to all the kids who think drinking syrup is cool, don't get me wrong it tastes amazing and it 
might help you sleep at night
, but all the other side effects, it's not worth it.
Tim Westwood: So the bloated stomach, putting on the weight, being backed up like a mother fucker-
Danny Brown: And then if you don't have it, you gotta shit like crazy. You can't hold anything. 
You might as well get some Imodium A-D and keep them in your pocket like peppermints.
 Literally as soon as you start eating. You might not even have nothing in your stomach, just a couple drops of water. A lot of people listening think it's like a glamorous thing, it's not man!
Tim Westwood: I can't even imagine, if I were gonna come off the syrup I'd be scared to fart.
Danny Brown: But that's why people continue to drink. And then you have some people that drink all the time and talk about it but you don't see the signs of that. So I think there's a lot of punks, 
I think there's a lot of studio sipping.
Tim Westwood: You think so?
Danny Brown: 
They talk about but they ain't about it.
Tim Westwood: They ain't about it.
Danny Brown: Yeah. They just promoting it. At the end of the day, yeah, it is for no reason.
Tim Westwood: With that, sleeping is good though?
Danny Brown: Yeah and it was good for me to sleep, you're traveling to different time zones, you'd just be messed up, and then you have to go back out. So to go home and sleep for two days that would be great for me.
Tim Westwood: That's how crazy it is, you just sleep for hours?
Danny Brown: Yeah I would probably sleep like ten hours. Just out, real deep sleep. You don't even know you sleep. That's the thing, that's why a lot of people die in they sleep because of some habit while you sleep. If something weird were to happen while you sleep and you can't take care of it.
Tim Westwood: And sometimes, man, you just shut down in your sleep, everything just shuts down.
Danny Brown: Now I just take a Xanax, man.  drinking two-liters of soda, you know, shitting on myself everywhere. You trying to bring lean to Africa with you. Just 'cause you don't want to get sick.
Tim Westwood: So you have to travel with some lean?
Danny Brown: All the time! Last time I was with you I was drinking lean, remember?
Tim Westwood: How do you travel with quantities of lean?
Danny Brown: Because you can take three ounces of liquid on a plane. You know, you can buy those travel things, just put three ounces in there. It could be shampoo, they don't know what it is, and if they do find it, it's my cough syrup. I had a big bottle I had to break -
Tim Westwood: Just break it out-
Danny Brown: And get through. But then you ain't out there drinking to be drinking, you out there to get your stomach right.
Tim Westwood: Maintain and self-medicate.
Danny Brown: It's nasty, though. So, don't drink lean, kids, don't drink lean.
Tim Westwood: So, you think lean should go down the sink?
Danny Brown: Yes. 
I don't think it should be a drug that's glorified.
 
It's liquid heroin, it's an opiate.
Tim Westwood: Nothing glamorous, man.
Danny Brown: 
I mean, it tastes amazing!
 To have your brain go back to that, it tastes amazing. But once you get addicted to that taste, man, it's just a brain thing, it's like a mental thing, you're just stuck there. I haven't been drunk in a month, month-and-a-half, and not a day goes by that I don't taste it in my mouth.
Tim Westwood: Are you feeling it is taking a lot of effort and self-control and self-will and discipline ?
Danny Brown: I think it's just helping me because I'm gone. If I was home, I'd be around people who drink.
Tim Westwood: So, the road is your rehab. But do you think that you could slip back in two years' time?
Danny Brown: No, I don't even want to think like that, no. It's not something you can do soci- it's not something you can do recreationally. One sip, and you back. It's like smoking crack or something. It's nothing you can play around with, be like ""Let me taste your cup.""
Tim Westwood: I used to smoke a spliff every day, smoke a spliff in the morning, and now I only smoke once a week.
Danny Brown: Once you sip, you drink it, all day, every day. Like I say, man, it's  a liquid form of heroin with you. Everybody know what heroin do to people.
Tim Westwood: Well, I want to wish you good luck with that. You had some low moments. What were those moments like, feeling like?
Danny Brown: I've been drinking that shit for the last two years. Anybody who's been dependent on something for that long, you'll have emotional issues. As long as I'm not at home, I'll be fine.
Tim Westwood: 
Now, you tweeted out during the low moments. Do you feel like that was a cry for help, saying you're going through a hard time?
Danny Brown: No, that was just one of those things that I probably could've kept to myself. Twitter is a motherfucker sometimes. Sometimes your battery just needs to die. But you know, I'm the type of person that wears my heart on my sleeve. I don't live for nobody but me.
Tim Westwood: What I understand is that there was not enough people reaching out to you. Not fans, but other artists, there were no artists who were reaching out to you.
Danny Brown: No, I was just in my feelings, you know? At the end of the day, it was just me getting off drugs and being emotional and being in my feelings. I was just feeling a type of way that day. I'm over it now. Everybody that I felt like I cared about, that I do care about, that cares about me, they reached out to me. They saw that shit, like, ""What the fuck are you talking about?"" I was just tripping, man.
Tim Westwood: 
Was the ASAP Mob there for you?
Danny Brown: Rocky was actually trying to call me, but I didn't know it was his number, so I didn't pick up, so I missed out on Rocky. 
Chase talked to me, though.
Tim Westwood: He's good people. So, I wish you the best of luck on your journey, man.
Danny Brown: Thank you. I'm still out there having fun, you know?",https://genius.com/Danny-brown-statements-on-giving-up-lean-annotated
Generation Rx,The Hybrid ,2010,"Looking at this pill in the middle of my palm
Pop it, sip some cola, 30 minutes, it be on
Staring at the sidekick, words come to me
Rolling up the Swisher, puffing on the loosie

Got a nigga focused, feeling alright
With this type of feeling, I can write all night
I never had a problem with paying attention
Popped the Adderall, then I wrote a verse in minutes
Play this in your iPod, nodding on Vicodin
Man, this shit legal, it must be alright then
Nigga, yeah, right, this shit even worse
When doctor wrote prescription, your addiction was birthed
Turn your kids to fiends with a drug called Ritalin
This is for my niggas popping Xannies, not remembering
Uh... what they did last night
Pills and orange tubes got the government right
They say there's no stopping from starting Oxycontins
They in trailer parks sniffing it with rolled dollars
All about a dollar, baby killers in the world
The ones that supply you, when you gotta fucking cold

I can't feel, when I'm off this pill
No doubt, I done 'em all, Xanny bars, Adderall
My mind drifts, let it dissolve in what I sipped
My soul blowing in the wind, eat pills and Vicodins

They say I, might go out like Heath Ledger
Laughing at the Joker off an antidepressant
And if you can't sleep, they got a pill for that
Brown good in popping Enzyte to get my dick fat
Fags take hormones to grow a set of titties
Got a pill to make your dick hard, when you're 60
Now tell me do that add up, G
When they lock your ass up for a dimebag of weed
Teen girls take birth control, killing off the seeds
Got her looking 20, when she only 15
They got illegal ones like X and Mescaline
In my teens my homie took one, he did 15
My granny turned out on them blood pressure pills
And if she don't pop 'em, she might not be here
But is it really helping make a nigga shed a tear
I wonder, do they make a pill to take away your fears?",https://genius.com/Danny-brown-generation-rx-lyrics

Contra,The Leftovers Unmixedtape,2010,"From the hood where them niggas pack fullys
Turn an ounce of reg to a cutty
Count money with a 10 deep flannel on
SB's looking like they been painted on
Jeans fitting like they was made for me
Your pants looking like, they was hand-me-downs from your Daddy
Get at me, 
my fit worth a stacky
I'm in a Caddy getting head in the back seat
Rubbing on her yakki
Then it start raining, when I start cumming
So now I'm brainstorming, on how I'm gon' run it
And y'all like fags – pussy? You don't want it
Gosh darn it, got heat like furnace
And I raise it like thermostat
Rolling that Thundercat kush look like Panthro
Heard you grab your ankles, take it in your manhole
That's so disgusting, I think I just threw up in my mouth
Can somebody pass me a towel?
A wetnap or something? Nigga is you fronting?
I beat you in your face, now your head like a pumpkin
Jack-o-Lantern,
 
I'm Danny Tanner
Watching that white girl,
 you a dry jheri curl
You worthless piece of shit
Your baby mama begged me to suck my dick
And I ain't gon' let her, she look like Predator
You a gay boy like David Archuleta
Contra, where niggas pierce armor
It's two niggas, two guns, blowing out your conscience
You see them chrome 44's, in this bitch with thirty men
Y'all niggas know the code like..

Up-Up, Down-Down
Left-Right, Left-Right
B-A, B-A, Select-Start

When I write y'all, I blackout like nightfall
I'm never shitted on like that flight stall, that's quite small
You wouldn't like me when I get gutter, it's the legit cutter
And you ain't sharp enough to split butter
I stack riches, throwing niggas in black ditches
You wack which is why you mixed up like when the track switches
Hand on my nuts like my sac itches
Looking like The Mack, hitting 'lac switches
Hiding guns in my Abercrombie
With a dime piece, getting more brain than a zombie
Times 3, 
Ladies Love Cool J
I need a bitch with more class than a school day
I heard a fool say I wasn't in his top 3
Stepped off with a broke arm and a popped knee
See me and Brown is no regular team
We make the whole planet flip like Omega Supreme
Yeah, make 'em hype, yo I murder with this tight flow
You a typo, plus you suck like lypo
I keep bodies hid, fuck a John Gotti bid
Talk money, then we can chop it up like the Karate Kid
But don't think I won't clap and merk 'em
Infrared, beam 'em up, I will Captain Kirk 'em
And turn 'em to a brainless dodo
And break 'em both, legs one and two, like when Kane was solo
I'm snatching up his chains and Polo, the flow's fitted
To pose with it in the strangest photo
I'm bumping blue genie, if your stacks is too teeny

Really burnt when I'm on that snare

Hoes stay clicking like a backup dancer

Around these needles putting poison in your veins
What they be speaking putting poison in your brain

Flow with a cosmo, popper stopper apostle
Kinda like I lasso hostile profile
You don't wanna get jacked so
Get hit up with that rocko
Ball so hard, when you land, leave a pothole
Ever since a snot-nose I've been about dough
Staring out the window, dreaming of a studio
Writing in my notepad, honing my craft
Base one on a full track, play it back, hell is that?
Representing me on mash

Rat bitch rubbing on her titties off the roll
Nigga, calm down, listen for the door
I know my baby momma bet not call no more
Bitch talking Pampers, know she full of shit
Impossible for babies to take that many shits
Rapping 'bout bricks, but I ain't never seen one

Used to bring the lettuce, then I had to dead it
Ass tried to sing every time he wanted credit

New Year come around, claim a baby on your taxes

Three gram dimes of weed, you was rocking Chloe glasses
Did it for the Jordans for what you feel important
In '02, my weed increased the dropout rate at Northern
Senior bitches skipping, get 'em weeded out
And take 'em to the back room, my nigga smut 'em out
Hood rat bitches putting blunts in they mouth
Smoke some weed, order Coney, time to fuck and out
Rock a fit for three days and go and cop a new one
Rode a bike to Linwood to give away my ones

Pour alcohol on her like a scratched CD
Bitch I'm Brown who the fuck is you
Show her some green and the ho turn blue
Ignorant as fuck but I'm smarter than you
Sixes on the chevy, hustle harder than you
So immature but the rims so grown
Catch me in the club whilin' off the Patron
40 on me dog I don't never get searched
If a nigga trip then he might get murked
Better swallow your pride
Stomp a nigga at the bar, fuck going outside

You ain't got a man but you got a baby daddy
Go out ya way to get drunk at a party every Saturday
But who am I to judge, baby? Want another drink?
Tonight give me your brain, you ain't gotta think
Just let yourself go, tomorrow blame the alcohol
You ain't got a job, it ain't like you got a class tomorrow
Find you a purse to borrow, beats is like your friends
Start being in thoughts cause the party never ends
I.D. say 22, shop at Forever 21
Best friend 30, she's forever 21
Going down the same path, take another sip
Pour another glass, take another hit
I tell you that you're beautiful, your pops never did
Probably why it ain't a pop around for none of your kids
Sorry for putting out ya biz
But right now I can't stop looking at them tits
And grabbing on that ass, filling up the glass
Get you drunk and fuck you, that's a part of my task
And she really helping, being a real sport about it
Full cup of Goose, pinch of cran and she allowed it
20 minutes later, man, she really all about it
20 minutes later, man, she took a nigga out, kid, drinks on me

Pass the designated driver the keys
And don't worry y'all, drinks on me, so have a toast with me
Bring your I.D. hanging with me
It's on my tab y'all, drinks on me, so have a toast with me
Hennessey and Grand Cru for me
I take a sip and say free Max B, so have a drink with me
So don't worry y'all, 'bout no fees
I said I got it y'all, drinks on me, so have a drink with me

Say my auntie sort of like an alcoholic
Been drinking since the teens, shitting blood in the toilet
Started real young, nigga pushed the bottle on her
Drunk, fully clothed in tubs, I cut showers on her
But I still love her and I live life for her
She ask me for a dollar, I'm gon' give it to her
Stay drinking on the brew, keep a can in her hand
Tied grocery bag full of keystone cans
Alcoholism has poisoned our city
Liquor store on every corner ain't like that in other cities
So you have a drink, take a hit and pass that
Give a buck to a wino help him buy crack
Dwell on the past, looking towards tomorrow
Wish I could lend my pain, let you borrow my sorrow

Lips of a prostitute, buff-ass nigga
Having trouble with the childproof, nigga outlined you
Don't make me go back to that, nigga on a Mongoose
Rest in peace Ron Gook, sitting in a old school
Smoking on some Goku, buds like Dragon Balls
Tequila with the lime juice, times two cyborgs
Smoking on some grapefruit, hoes come twice

Stacks in the Foamposite, work in the Jansport
Praying for a personal, every time I go to court
Eastland shopping bag, ho's at the food court
Around the time you got your sounds put in that mammoth
I was on Clairmount, 3 for 10 slanging
Shining like the silver on a Air Max '95
Took this rap shit serious about in '05
Got these niggas scared, ask them if I'm lying
Because I shit on niggas bar for bar without trying
Ain't in your top three? Then bitch, you can't count

Roll another spliff, pop another pill
Live every day like a nigga going away
When getting locked, fucking with the pot
Gotta nigga two hots and a top cot
Some niggas like to plot, I move on instinct
Nigga, I can lock down a year in a precinct
And these bars will still be hotter than your new shit
Why you try to keep it warm like somebody else piss?
In that drop on the way to the P.O
You talk shit, turn his bitch to El Nino
Rap jalapeno, flow Neo Geo
Crunk like Lil' Jon, ""Bia Bia"" live in Rio
Nigga do a peep show, fucking quarter freak ho
Hit you with the cinco, now you niggas el finito

Iller than I ever been, blowing on that medicine
Used to have dreams of copping cribs on Edison...
Now I'm doing shit thought I never could afford
Art on the wall like science project boards
Parquet floor, green like Celtic
Furniture you touch be like whats this velvet?
Used to play the block with the sack by the pelvis
Fiends ODing on they toilet like Elvis

So now I kill beats, so much coroners pick up notepad sheets
Bullhead skinnies Hilfiger fleece, sort of like a futuristic 1993
A lot my niggas dead, a lot my niggas locked
A lot my niggas left and moved on from the block
Some of my niggas here and some got guap
And some may gotta piss in a mothafuckin' pot
We used to play the block, we never get old
The fridge ain't got shit but the bread with the mold
And some ain't got shoes just the ones with the holes
The one you call talkers with the fucking flapping soles
So now we change the system to shit we can't afford and
Check from Mickey D's can't buy a pair of Jordans
And hot boys gotta get it how they live

Close your eyes, I'm 'bout to take you to a city
It ain't pretty, it ain't nowhere to go (It ain't nowhere to go)
Run and hide when you on the other side
It ain't easy, it ain't nowhere to go (It ain't nowhere to go)
Land of misery a place full of history
But seriously, it's nowhere to go (It's nowhere to go)

I seen my nigga Luck before he went up for life
He said, Brown you nice and nigga send your sacrifice
Chill on the streets, it ain't here for ya
Cause when you get locked, nobody care for ya
Did a little time ain't make a phone call
Book stay thick like a church going broad
Locked in the county ain't never seen a thorough
Now I hit the thrift stores cop a vintage polo
Never talk loud to get my point across
The only alligator that I rock is Lacoste
Detroit player, word to my nigga Big
Play this type of shit while you rocking up for Big

Need Another Drink,The Hybrid ,2010,"Hybrid!

When it's hot, you need another drink
What you think? A nigga gonna do, go outside?
Smoke a blunt in the car and come back
And get some love in the club

I see a lot of hoes, they all on my dick
Bunch of player haters wanna front for a bitch
If a bitch want to fuck me, then let her do her thing
Just step the fuck back, and let her give me brain
I'm insane like Hussein
It's like I got two brains
See my shoe game
And say them shit's butane, y'all niggas too lame
My bill game like poontang
Nine niggas on a track like Wu-Tang
Shoot like a two guard from Tulane
Big Ving Rhames niggas at the door
Like, like, like, you rang? No need for ID
Walk straight past security, they don't search me
Put three numbers in my phone 'fore I reach VIP

When it's hot, you need another drink
What you think? A nigga gonna do, go outside
Smoke a blunt in the car and come back
And get some love in the club
When it's hot, you need another drink
What you think? A nigga gonna do, go outside
Smoke a blunt in the car and come back
And get some love in the club

On the block, and on the street
They keep banging, they keep banging them trees
No seeds in my cigarillo, we be blacker than Romillo
Tasting like Sugar Hills, let me pop another pill
Silver eighteen hundred
Kryptonite, yep, yep, yep, I'm on it
No not Superman you can call it X-Clan
Black red and green, sissies
All my bitches eat pussy like Missy
But they look like Chrissy
From Three's Company, roll another blunt for me
Smoke so much weed like I'm tryna lose my memory
Like I'm tryna smoke away my mad thoughts
Blunt gave 'em up, a bit too bad go
She wanna hit it, and I do too
I ain't talking 'bout the weed bitch, I'm talking 'bout you

When it's hot, you need another drink
What you think? A nigga gonna do, go outside
Smoke a blunt in the car and come back
And get some love in the club
When it's hot, you need another drink
What you think? A nigga gonna do, go outside
Smoke a blunt in the car and come back
And get some love in the club",https://genius.com/Danny-brown-need-another-drink-lyrics
Kool Aid,Silicon Valley (Music from the HBO Original Series),2017,"You fruits get pints to stir up, bust your girlfriend cherry
Smoking on that grape and that be rolled up in strawberry
Niggas sour as that lemonade

Get the fuck up out of my mix

Coming down like Santa Claus
Her pussy furry like panda paws
Beat a pussy ass nigga with the jabber jaws
Talk about shit they weren't involved
Be like, ""Get the fuck up out of my mix""
Nosy ass niggas always in my business
Wonder how I got it and wonder how I get it
Wonder where we keep it and they wonder where we spend it
Run up on me then we run up where you're living
Tell you one thing and you're back, nah forget it
Disrespect me then we come up where you're living
Worry 'bout me, better worry about yourself
Your family, your friends, be worried 'bout their health
See I'm tired of all of these pocket-watchers
Niggas watching my pockets
Wanna know where I spend it at, tryna figure out how I got it
Doing everything except working
Then you wonder why you're hurting
If you ain't got the assertion, better get up out and do something
See my best advice is just stop it, nigga
'Cause you ain't gon' do nothing
You a pop-lock-it and drop-it nigga, a bitch nigga be trouble
Drop a pack in that water, now I whip, whip and then serve it

I can't feel my face now, but I feel that bass now
Do a girl from the waist down
I'ma knock the boots like H-Town
Out there looking at me like Mase now
Touch and tease like Case now
Gone 'head, just break it down
Bring it back, come back around
Niggas talk worse than bitches
So out here gotta watch who you kick it with
Spread rumors, they textin'
Circle smaller than crouchin' midgets
Tell you one thing, girl, you better not forget it
Disrespect me then we coming where you living
Worry 'bout me, better worry about yourself
Family and friends, be worried 'bout their health

Dance,Hot Soup,2008,"One, two, three to the four
Yeah I'm back on my grind
Like you ain't know
It's Detroit brat, tryna get that bread
But I won't turn to X like Detroit Red
I'm up early, knocking roaches off my toothbrush
In the spot hoodie on just like the Ku Klux
Walk around this bitch, like I got four nuts
So when I wet them bitches, swing like nunchucks
Came a long way from getting jumped by Chemp
Chopping up white like Stefan Grendt
Flow like a champ, way ahead of my peers
And again I smoke strong, like Stevie Wonder's ears
Im in the cutty, with the money on my mind
Finger on the trigger, hand on my nine
So I can't afford time
But I got the AP of the fruity lemon line

And I ain't too tough to dance
Let me adjust this heater
Bulging out of my pants
First I step to the left
Then I step to the right
Then you drop it down low
Bring it back, ight? (Hey!)

Five, six, seven to eight
'Bout to slide on you hoes, just like home plate
I get brain early, that mean I think first
You draw last, you paint a picture of a black hearse
Fuck what you think, I'm 'bout that bank
Stones like the button of your 
Marvis Tanks
Top full clip, and your bitch on my dick
Cause you're broke like looses, in your pants pocket
It barely sit above the rim
And I wore gats like bass heads pull on strings
Me and my man, two guns like contra
Keep your bitch, she looks like My Pet Monster
Lame nigga, got no choice but to trick
Probably could fuck a blind ugly bitch
I can't get enough of these hoes
Grab my hand and walk me straight to the dance floor

And I ain't too tough to dance
Let me adjust this heater
Bulging out of my pants
First I step to the left
Then I step to the right
Then you drop it down low
Bring it back, ight? (Hey!)

I don't think they know man

S.O.S.,The Hybrid ,2010,"I act like I'm that baby Brenda threw away
But I shine like I never seen a rainy day
Kinda cloudy like them diamonds that them rappers wear
Clowning like jesters that be in front of kings chairs
But they don't make a crown big enough to fit my head
My self-esteem high, see it can nest eggs
I'm sipping vodka straight, eating on fish eggs
Cashmere, and the color pastel
Used to have that crack like the liberty bell
But now I hit chicks with lips like Estelle
New SL, lights like fish eyes
Bitches say the dick good like Mickey D's French fries
Y'all never held weight, sorta like an ant thigh
Think you're doing bad? Think about Apartheid
Look in a narc's eyes, ask him why he flicked me
Said, ""Brown, I had to, just look at your history""
Tried to tell the dude the truth
He still reminiscing when he used to lock me up for curfew
But I was just a young nigga staying past street lights
Kinda fascinated finding out what the streets like
Learned my lesson, for sure changed my ways
But the hook still treat me like the kid I was yesterday

And I'm still that nigga
We just getting started, roll another swisher
Crack another brew, cop another fifth
These rap niggas trash and all their beats filth
I pull up on 'em, my hat on tilt
The cutty sitting high like Shaq on stilts
Like Shaq on stilts

It's like a unidentified foreign object
How you describe Brown as simple as a clock tick
But his beats harder than a witch nipple
Crazy as a hippie with a rifle sipping ripple
Beat you with a mini bat 'til you reconsider that
That chain looking rusty dog, get rid of that
I'm a pirate with the pyrex
Might fuck a bitch raw, Magic ain't died yet
Y'all niggas flow like cable, just the basic channel
Dough in front the fireplace, stacks to the mantel
Pleading guilty to anything they offer us
Copping out like quitting police officers
But we off it bruh, cases we forfeit
6's high, hope the 24's fit
Instigate beef and we all get torched
In the middle of the bull, like united center half court
Blow Newport, laughing at you hoes
Hitting y'all raw like wetting Gizmo
After twelve, how can I excel
In the city where niggas don't know what's real",https://genius.com/Danny-brown-sos-lyrics

""Homeboy, I thought you was gonna help me I'm all by myself
See, when you gonna help me take care of this"" (Baby)
Put you on child support, now you gotta go to court
Now they hit your checks to take care of that (Baby)
Thought about abortion, but she couldn't afford it
And you was locked up, fighting them charges
Now you on the street, diapers ain't cheap
And you slang weed to take care of that (Baby)
No education, the odds are slim of making it
So now you'll fuck with any nigga, that'll bring the bacon in

Detroit so crazy
Feel like Pac, and Brenda's got a (Baby)
Everywhere I look, young girl up in them books
Virginity took, now she 'bout to have a (Baby)

She depends on welfare, to eat and her health care
Cause nobody else care, cause 2Pac ain't there
Dropped outta high school, tried to go to night school
Got a G.E.D. to take care of that (Baby)
Now she smoke blunts on the block and
Her feet ain't never washed, tryna get someone to watch her (Baby)
Have a baby in your teens, grown nobody want ya
Cause ain't nobody tryna be a damn step father
Bitch, you a bother, ho, is you crazy?
Get your ass in the house and watch your (Baby)

Guitar Solo,The Hybrid ,2010,"My little nigga 14
Got his hand on the 40 with the infrared beam
His daddy locked up and his momma is a fiend
Catch her tricking on the corner, knees dirty on her jeans
At night he never dreams cause he hardly ever sleep
Laying in the bed, facing someone else's feet
So late night he creep, walk around these streets
With the same hoodie on, he been wearing for a week
He wants something to eat, and his sneaks so scuffed
Just looking in his eyes, you can tell he living rough
Standing outside a gas station puffing on a loosie
Dropped outta school cause his peers appeared bougie
And they want Gucci, and shit that rappers talk
Robbed an old lady, but his ass got caught
Will he get out, man I really don't know bro
I hope I'll find out after the guitar solo

This little girl pregnant man she only 14
Bust in by an older nigga, lack of self-esteem
Her mom's a gold digger, and her dad is not around
Last time she saw him he took her to Belle Isle
A child with a child and her momma don't care
Another bridge card gon' put her on welfare
Baby daddy say he got her, prolly won't succeed
Cause he bought a pair of Cardi's 'stead of reing-up the weed
His dream is a cutty with some rims on that bitch
Is that the type of man you want raising your kids?
So now you ditch class cause your belly getting bigger
And every other day your momma fuck another nigga
So what she gonna do is find herself a drug dealer
Her dream and goal in life is to be saved by a nigga
And will she get far? I really don't know bro
I hope I find out after the guitar solo",https://genius.com/Danny-brown-guitar-solo-lyrics
Metal Gear Solid,The Hybrid: Cutting Room Floor  ,2010,"This rap's like Metal Gear Solid, chrome stay polished
White spots like on Rasheed Wallace
Any nigga think they frolic, this is not a promise
Bust a nigga in the head like Vonage
I smoke chronic, like a stressed rasta
You are not gangsta, you are an impostor
Kick it like Henry, this is not soccer
Spit it so vivid, Brown songs like opera
Fat lady singing, serenading you
Mask like the phantom, mothafucka, I will stab you
Ever seen a nigga with nothing to lose?
Desert Eagle cocked and it's aimed at you
Temper running short, cause his daughter missing meals
Running low on options gotta get it with the steel
Niggas got pills, but we ain't Morpheus
Posted in the hood, 40 on the porch with us
Nigga what's good? What you don't know?
Get your free tickets to tonight's murder show
So if you want to come through holla at me
Get your VIP RSVP, nigga, Metal Gear Solid

This raps like Metal Gear Solid, nigga, I'm Snake
I detect bitch nigga in your blood trait
Nigga you are dog-bait, show you how a slug taste
Little cockroaches get hit with the bug spray
Sorta like Subway, nigga losing weight
Front his ass to work, now you asking where we stay
Give his ass the pump like 10 on 8
Now we leave with pieces like birthday cake
You are not straight, nigga, you are gay
My hair long like Rappin' 4-Tay
Your bitch wanna braid it, say she got skills
But she's just fishing, want me to fill her gills
Nigga I'mma chill, I ain't really stunting you
Meat on her grill, just like a barbecue
Better call a audible, switch up your plays
That shit you running get you Blitz 2K
I throw bullets right in the flesh
If you intercept, you got shot
Hit you with some shit that you ain't coming back from
Brown tight like six niggas in a Maxima
40 count I see 'em holding drunk calcium
Cause your bones ain't breaking we cracking 'em
White sheets wrapping 'em
It's over it's a wrap for 'em, a rap for 'em",https://genius.com/Danny-brown-metal-gear-solid-lyrics
Let’s Go,Hot Soup,2008,"Another day, another dollar I make
Risk I take, for the chrome 28's
Momma said son, keep your head up
But it's hard in the D I gotta get my bread up
So I ride '94 with nowhere to go
Bag came in, cause I moved the bows
The son of a player no love for hoes
And the year ain't new, but it don't look old
Should hit Northland see what they got new
But I'd rather hit the store go fuck with the crew
Ride around the hood blow blunt after blunt
Seem like a good day I ain't seen a hook once
So I'm riding in the wood 'bout to pick my man up
Hit a couple corners probably roll some gan up
My man's got his heater 'cuz the streets is cold
But I told him put it up because my L's is bold

Let's go... c'mon, roll with a nigga
Where we going? I don't know my nigga
Let's blow, hey yo you got another swisher?
Light the gan up, c'mon roll with a nigga...

Just another day in the streets of the D
Gas on high and my tank on E
These hoes wanna fuck but they charge you a fee
And the work might cost but to murder is free
Pray and holler at my man 'cuz he owe me a few
Gan in the air, with a Bud Ice brew
Narco's ride, so I took my sack
And before hop on the lines 'cuz I know its packed
Break bows, so I ride slow, slow
Hit the Coney's cause my gas low, low
Cop a bag, roll a blunt and say to extras
And I swoop a couple hoes then ride up Dexter
Blow my trees, no stress at all
Gan in mine but it's stress in y'all
Hit the crib get dressed as soon as the sun fall
Right now I'm just rhyming, timing my phone calls",https://genius.com/Danny-brown-lets-go-lyrics
Thank God,The Hybrid ,2010,"Ain't no more food stamps, man they been stopped that
Give it to you on the card, if you follow these steps
And my girl got one, mean we gon' eat good
A week out the month, mean we gon' be full
And it's so hard, we depend on that
But who cares if generic brands in the cabinet?
So I'mma hit the hood, and see what's up though
Maybe try to cop some gan, hopefully I serve some custos
But if it don't work, I ain't gon' trip
Cause when my girl get off of work, we got to hit the market
And I got to help her with the boxes out the car
Yeah, boxes, boxes out the car
And it might sound hard but the steaks so soft
And I love the way she cook, hook the rice up with the broth
Yeah, pour another glass of pop y'all
And thank God for a Bridge Card

Let's bow our heads, hold hands, and thank God
Let's hit the market my baby and go hard
Let's hit Save a Lot and we can buy it all
Thank God for a Bridge Card, hey!

They say the hood starving, but we be eating
Frying wing dings with the fake Lawry seasoning
Yeah, Larry's, but it's still good though
Just one swipe, we barbecuing in the hood, bro
Eating cheese doodles, don't let the size fool you
Tonight we eating shrimp, take a break from the noodles
Yeah, and you know we out of place
When welfare the only thing that put a smile on her face
So baby cook some breakfast, I need my energy
I hit the block fresh, time to serve these fiends
Just tryna catch sales, you know how I do
And she got the WIC Card, so that's mad Juicy Juice
And I pipe her, call me the plumber
Even let me hit the store, told me her PIN number
Took the kids with me, told 'em go hard

I’m Out,The Hybrid ,2010,"I had to be like 15
My dog ain't have his ills but copped a Cutlass Supreme
Clean from an old white dude, he got a deal
And at the gas station where he got killed
Late night filling up, niggas shot him up
Asleep when the call came, news when I woke up
17 car-jacked, dead at the Mobil
I swear I shed a tear every time I see a photo
Now I'm all grown up same spot cop Swishers
Old school Chevy check the rear view mirror
Give a bum a buck, show the lil niggas love
Pocket full of kush, so I hit 'em with a nug
My homie left the hood, I ain't seen him in a minute
Pull up smoking reggie with his bitch in a rental
He said ""I just got out"" and can I let him hold something
I told him that I'm broke, man I ain't got nothing

And I'm out (Aight then)
In a '87 Cutty 'bout to go pick up a light skin
And I'm out (Aight then)
Blowing on some kush the color Minnesota Viking
And I'm out (Aight then)
Catch me swooping up a freak and I'm knowing how my night ends
And I'm out (Aight then)
Saying killa has some lightning, pipe blue or pipe thin

See this is all we know
Just running 'round the hood dog with nowhere to go
Wanna grab some Swishers but the narcs at the store
So we parked at my man's, put the chronic on hold
So now we just posting, drinking on some 40's
My nigga got his 40 said drop him at his shorty's
Told my nigga chill, 'bout to roll one with hash
Soon as the hook leave then my nigga we can smash
All in rotation, puff-puff passing
Eyes like cherries through magnifying glasses
Think I got the munchies, my nigga, you hungry?
'Bout to run to Cork Town grab us some mudgies
The blunt turned to ash, gave a dap and laughed
Drunk the rest of the 40, threw the bottle in the trash
Made sure I had my phone, grabbed a square out the pack
Gave my homie that, jumped in the Cutty then I smashed",https://genius.com/Danny-brown-im-out-lyrics

All the talk in the streets
Don't bother me none
I lay in bed don't miss a second of sleep
Blow a blunt pass out don't count no sheep
Wake up blow another one and still don't eat
Ice melting in the grand cru
Too high for rude comments
I look down on you
I'm humble and too nice
But I don't talk to no Nigga that can't look me in my eyes
Smoke a newport and take a shit
And text your bitch
She know she really want it
I'm just trying to crash the boards like udonis
Blow some chronic now she all up on it
Used to catch the bus to Great Lakes
Too many hoes on me man dog I know they fake
Cause where were your hoes at
When I was tapping hoes and they couldn't even look back
I rather just kickback
And fuck with wifey
Rock heels she don't fuck with nikes
She say papi put it all inside me
And I don't do shit lay back and let her ride me
(Hook)
Look how it all can change
Things change start getting some change
Same friends used to ask for change
A straight change cause they say you changed
And now look how it all can change
It feels strange when they say you changed
But think about it man you changed your life
Changed your car
Changed your crib
Changed your wife
How the fuck can I act funny
Far as I know I ain't never been bummy
And these bitches can't change me
Baby momma shot a mood
So I treat 'em al the same
I don't share things got my own lane
Niggas in he hood call me by my government name
Respected in the D used to hustle on 12th street
And I'm from Linwood
So you know I'm so hood
Should have been God merc
But I'm fighting in the D like Emanuel Steward
Niggas see you and won't say two words
But when your ass die they want to say a few words
And my real niggas I'll take a case for
Cock back drop back I'll take a face full
Niggas fake ain't no pride no more
Wonder why these real niggas won't ride no more
(Hook)
Look how it all can change
Things change start getting some change
Same friends used to ask for change
A straight change cause they say you changed
Look how it all can change
It feels strange when they say you changed
But think about it man you changed in life
Changed your car
Changed your crib

I drink that wine up, and say I love the taste
I show up at the banquet, I get my swag on
Them white niggas grinning, they get they fag on
Now I'm on some other shit, I'm at the hotel
With a bunch of hookers, they yelling go head
Don't worry they all gay, them hoes is coke heads
Next day on the paper sniffing coke, I knew them hoes would tell
But see I get them votes, because I know some rappers

So let me take away that stress
Just escape for the moment and let your problems rest
I mean I'll really pay attention
Tell me 'bout that bitch you hate, and this time I really listen
Cause today's 'bout you
Wanna see that pretty smile, so what you wanna do?
Go to the movies, plan next day shopping?
Play Maxwell 'till the cops come knockin'?

You got my head goin', that's why I give it, don't stop

I can't get you outta my mind, so
Come with me and just spend some time

I know that life can be a bitch
Let's plan a vacation, take a far trip
Take you out the D, away from all the city fumes
Leave your job behind, don't even worry 'bout school
We can spend the night on the beach
Playin' in the sand, watchin' waves, 'till we sleep
Wake up in the morning, eat breakfast on the rooftop
94 degrees, have you sweatin' in your tube top
And let the problems come back
You got my head goin', that's why I keep coming back
Waist so little, but that ass so fat
Gotta nigga gone girl, now how you do that?
I know this world can get you down
So when you feeling bothered girl, call on Brown
Even doe I'm chasin' this bread
I can't get you outta my head

Demons and Angels,The Hybrid: Cutting Room Floor  ,2010,"I'm so ahead of my time
My pops ain't even bust his first nut yet
I'm a-whole-nother subject
Extra-curriculum
Passion just to get more credit used synthetic
After this call the medic
Got a fetish for anything the color of lettuce
But they cut the horses' wings, yeah, a Pegasus
While you on some new car, new necklace
I transcend nice, y'all niggas alright okay, get ya bars up
Hit Starbucks, grab a bag of whole bean
Whole food deli sandwiches
Blowing OG and I wrote this shit, and it goes like this
A penny for your thoughts, but I plan to make millions
Or die crying in the end like the villain, or sipping Teqo in outdoor pavilions
They keep telling me I'm brilliant
And I concur, cause my metaphors are better than yours
I broke obituary like brochure
And I'm tryna have mine like novel, rap Dan Brown fight Angels and Demons
That's why I'm sipping on this bottle
I take your ho to Aeropostale and she show me her body parts like Hostel

Uh, nigga, I'm the nicest man, I don't give a fuck

It ain't tricking if you got it
Yeah, right it ain't tricking if it's Jeep
If I can afford this you will absorb my semen
Dinners making copy cat peas from mean mints
Fiends leaning throwing up, Willie Beaman
On the grind like strippers on zippers
To y'all young whippersnappers, nigga, I'm a blizzard
Nigga that's cold, I would do you so bold
If you ever disrespect this dialect, uh

And my notepad's the blueprint, watch how I fuel shit
Getting away, watch these whore hats kill shit

Brown Eyes,What’s Poppin Volume 1,UnKnown,"(Verse 1: Danny Brown)
My Uncle offa Blow, nodding while he standing up
Minute’s been stuck like he picking something up
Rolling up the swisher 
with the sac
 under my nuts
While I’m puffin on a 
Lucie
, talkin bout the latest truck
And Hi (how) ima come up and get one next summer
So next summer won’t be talking bout next summer
Yo bitch is a runner, my niggas had fun with her
Did the whole team and heard you put a gun to her
Homie that ain't pimpin, soft hearted for these hoes
I feeds em lots of pills, and put coke up in they nose
Go to thrift stores, drop a buck on t-shirts
Lines
 in the dressing room then she bought a cheap purse
Straight up out the hut with some suburb hoes
Expensive perfume and some new old clothes
Cuss it ain't high end, ain't gotta be vintage
She buy her own drinks and week supply of spinach
(Verse 2: Daniel Sewell)
Now baby break it down just to build it back up
Copped a couple pounds, then help me bag it up
A pill and a half now a nigga acting up...
Drunk too much, now a nigga throwing up
But that was last night, nigga I’m still drinking
Smoking on the purple got a nigga pupil shrinking
Plotting on a 
Lincoln
, get it with the ink pin
You Fucking with me, my nigga what you thinking
Your bars too immature this is grown man flow
And that’s why my bitches grown with some grown man dough
You’re fucking with them youngins, on the phone with them hoes
I text a bitch a message now she knockin' at the door
Naw that’s the pill man, let me get four
I swear this the last time, I won’t do it no more

For breakfast it was blunts, bout to get a couple Pop Tarts
Used to ride around with the heckler
Lil' nigga on his grind, Ryan Sheckler
Stash in the dresser
So fuck a school lecture
From professors
Like a teacher I test ya
Never smoke regular haze in a swisher
Runnin' through snow like blades in the winter
Now I treat beats like crack on broke mirrors
Slow like a gem star, nothings been delivered
And now you're all high
So you can thank I
Fuckin' with Brown cause I keep a good supply
I know a lot of fiends that say they can't cry
Cause they sniff so much that it dried out their eyes

Chronic I smoke, I bail it then inhale it

I get them checks on the first like a monthly subscription
They holla at me every day because they need their prescription
I'm like a male cheerleader: white girls are flippin'
Make Christians lose religions off the shit that I'm spittin'
I got families diminishin' offa what I'm distributin'
Finishin' the gimmicks with the shit I'm deliverin'
You're about to go fast like Thanksgivin' chit-er-lins
Don't end up a memory, niggas just rememberin'
Death anniversary, pourin' out some beer again
True Religion jeans with the laced up Timberlands
Bucket seats, bucket hat low like Gilligan
Hit your baby momma, left her panties on the ceilin' fan
Sent her to voicemail, but she gonna call again
Brown done came up and he won't fall again
Spittin for the hustlers cause the words are the empowerment
Smarter than those white boys in Ivy league colleges
But I used to move work to white boys in colleges
Most you rap niggas lyin' like a horoscope
Homie you homo like the Rocky Picture Horror Show
Seats in the Chevy same color as a kiwi skin
Voice of the hood, you rap niggas is CNN

Heater on the waist, box cutter in the parka
Fiends at the door, Cold D up in lockup
Smokin' on ganja, sippin' java from Starbucks
Chillin' with chicken, roll gan out dey purses
Browntown served more niggas than churches
Die for your rhymes, then you wouldn't be worth shit

No water in the house, underarm must
Puttin' water in the toilet just to make the fucker flush

Shorty got a ass but she playing hard to get
Poured a cup of Goose, then took a couple sips
Rolled up the purple, then I took a couple hits
Asking about Nick Speed, she was all on my dick
Crooks tee, Air Max from overseas
True Religions bluer than the oceans in the sea
I'm just trying to get up in them Juicy jogging pants
Wash your toe rings and send home to you're man
I can do things that you wish he can
Let me hold your legs while you do a handstand
Shorty let me taste that applesauce
Have you grabbing sheets saying ""oh my god""
Climb the wall, scratch my back

Bet

You didn't know I could do it like that
Bet
You didn't know you could come like that
Got her mind gone and she keep coming back
Said she want it hard, said she want it fast
Said she love it when I'm smacking on her ass
Said she love it here, said she want it there
Said she love it when I'm pulling on her hair

Bend you over, lick your  girl
Sip that good wine and make the room swirl
Your ass out of control
So move girl, till the sun up, sun up
Switch your hairdo out when its done up, done up
So sexy when you dance and you like your ass smacked
Nasty girl want to get it all up in that clap trap
Plus I do all that wild shit you like
Make them bust every time, ain't nothing different tonight
I want to push all your buttons
You gotta be the shit
When your tush starts to  and slide on it's  it's busting out the most
Jelly shaker, remind me of the sandwich toast

Great Granddad,The Hybrid ,2010,"Kush got a nigga brain doing somersaults
Yesterday, clothes on smelling like a boss
Dick up in her mouth so she can't talk
Pop a pill and fuck a bitch 'til she can't walk
Now I'm standing in the shower bumping drum and bass
Stepped out put some Noxzema on my face
Hit a blunt twice and spared up my heart
Nigga my loft looking like a fucking skate park
But the only thing I'm griding is the boss nigga
Going nuts in the D, coast nigga
And that's a K not a C
Nigga, Brown chief like Kansas City
American Apparel Jockey Briefs
Staring in the window thinking ""Ha, I run the city!""
Renaissance like a sculpture in my back yard
Same nigga used to get F's on his report card

And I put that on great granddaddy's soul
Told me I'mma fuck bitches and always have hoes
So let me call another bitch up
A nigga tryna get his dick suck
Make my toes curl up when you licking my nuts
So when I call bitch, you better pick up
So let me call another bitch up
A nigga tryna get his dick sucked

Nah, what you think this is
I ain't paying for your cab bitch you ain't getting shit
Nah, but a mouth full of kids
Told the bitch take the bus guess what, she did it
Blew a nigga down like the wolf did the straw house
'til I huffed and puffed and shot it in her mouth
Now I got the skinnies sagging with the dirty chucks
Thrift store tee cost a nigga four bucks
Now hipster bitches bomb a nigga like Pearl Harbor
Swear to God, I treat a ho like I ain't got a daughter
Might as well do the same to my baby momma
While all my new hoes look like Jane Fonda
Bump techno and drive little-ass Honda
Give me brain and they say they learnt from their momma
Say she bi and make out with her best friend
Love it to death, but she ain't lesbian",https://genius.com/Danny-brown-great-granddad-lyrics

It's Danny Brown!
Nick's Beat!

Sway Seats minx floor with a digi' dash
Danny Brown got hoes like dance class
Float work make money get spent fast
Cutty on a 26 inches with the run flats
Tiger Fitted with the gan' in a swisher sweet
Trunk sounding like a Mazda on trickery
Got cute Feet, then what's your content?
Let me squirt it on your lips like carmex
She don't want me, just wanna hop in
Take her shopping, let me hit it at the drop in
Got the Cutty same color as some chickenskin
Every night I'm hoppin' in and out of chickenskin
In your residence counting up dividends
True allegiance jeans blue and yellow like Michigan
It ain't the vision its simple working at kitchen then
Its work attract and it's all simple at dishing things

My wheels so big got me sittin' in the sky
Shawty just smack it up on my thigh
You ain't never seen a Cutty sit up this high
Never seen a Cutty sit up this high
Man I'm so damn drunk, Man I'm 'boutta get high
Wheels so big, can't believe my eyes
You ain't never seen a Cutty sit up this high
Never seen a Cutty sit up this high

Danny Brown, not the rest of these niggas
Though I'm still young, gonna bet to these niggas
Bet no west, no safety on this trigger
Go correct when you step get split like a swiss
Smelling like John Paul in a ball slim sweater
VonZipper shades, help me see a little better
You knew better, you do better
World grand roof with the stitching on the leather
In the Escalade, rolling up haze
Whether nigga like dark skinned Jermaine Sway
Stuntin' in the hood, nigga 
Grab a nigga like Brenda try'na steal crack
Chilling on the block nigga, smoking on some kush
You ain't danny brown nigga, you just puss
See me go another direction
It ain't rocket science i keep the protection

My wheels so big got me sittin' in the sky
Shawty just smack it up on my thigh

Wheels so big, can't believe my eyes
You ain't never seen a Cutty sit up this high

Oh How hip hop really got big
The kids rebelled
The kids would yell at america
Rebelled at disco
Like, we had Rock 'n Roll kids saying disco sucked
We had black kids saying... y'know that wasn't into Rock n' Roll
We had no music
No, we had no real music to get into

Though its high tide still gotta stay afloat
Sweater over hoodie used to be my winter coat
Dish detergent liquid when we ran out of soap
Walk in to the store plastic bag filled with bottles
Stolen basic cable on our ol' floor model
Check in the fridge, nothing to eat
Baby mama killing roaches with her bare feet
My nigga hit me off I fucked up the sack
Trip to Coney Island fucking with a hood rat
Now a nigga back, right where I started
Real true livin' definition of an artist
So now a nigga old but ain't shit changed
Hid this morning when the light people came
Now point me to heaven cause this sure is hell
Tell me whats the difference from being in a cell

Mama in the kitchen, scrapin' up a dinner
Daddy play the lottery, hope he got a winner
My brother on the block, tryna catch sales
Sister on the pole, shake her fruit cocktail

Daddy play the lottery, hope he got a winner
My brother on the block, tryna catch sales
Sister on the pole, shake her fruit cocktail

I got locked up, I came back home
Takin' county chances, just to keep my phone on
My baby mama trippin', that bitch don't even work
Stress a nigga out, got me payin' child support
I'm flirtin' with the Beam, I got a date with death
38 revolver, got two bullets left
Sometimes I daydream, about puttin' in myself
Runnin' up to heaven, trippin' up the steps
My nigga want a square, only got one left
So I'm a bust it down with you
If I had it dog, I'd blow a pound with you
My nigga understand, that's just how shit goes
That's why we get high, cause we feel so low
And tho we livin' fast, the money comin' slow
Got a lid up on my nigga, cause his time goin slow
Said a pray for him quick, fans gotta let him know

In this jungle I'm gorilla with a silverback
You phony like fruit drink concentration
Brown hard like Coney Island bacon
But you don't learn like gas stations
Now you're ICU patients
Cop the cutty on the weekend
Pussy niggas leaking vaginal secretion
45 put a hole where you lease in
Hit your baby mama pussy look like sheep skin

If you ain't getting money what you came for?
Surgery with the chainsaw
If you ain't getting money get the fuck out

And if I don't see some cash soon
You gon' look like Scarface homie in the bathroom
See all we do is pass the fire
Blunt in your mouth just like a pacifier
If I'm in the kitchen homie I ain't cooking eggs
Our spot's open just like a hooker's legs
If I'm in the kitchen homie I be cooking keys
Pot scratched like a hooker's knees
Getting money from the broth
Hit licks for a living like a preacher with a gospel
Food stamps in the collection plate
Yeah, Jesus know we on Section 8
Fresher than the first week of school
After Christmas vacation when the year's brand new
Phone dead got to charge up my battery
Because I got more hoes than beauty shops on a Saturday


I'm bringing fat niggas back I am so sweet
Grown as hell throwing rocks at the police
Me and your big brother got an old beef
He walked in on me face-fucking your niece
Hustle hard in a spot for four weeks
German Shepherd in the front yard, no leash
I got more guns than the hood got mice
Got more bullets than Japan got rice
Your costume jewellery shit is not ice
Tell your man quit rapping the nigga's no nice
I'm out cold like a winter bum
Your bitch be mad I didn't tell her when I'm finna' cum
I tell her ass quit acting all reckless
Bitch my nuts a part of a complete breakfast
Yeah you niggas official
Johnny come to the hood get paid with a pistol

Used to ask Mama, why we gotta be poor
Days got hard, nights got rough

Unlucky lost my four leaf clover

And the sounds of my nigga Nick Speed

Back on our grizzly, blue foamposites
Cost 350
About make history, smoking on that Pippy(?)
Traveled many places, kept the D with me
I ain't had a dollar, living off tuna
Heard I was broke, then it wasn't no rumor
Had to make a way, so I said ""Fuck it
Newports for dinner just ain't gon' cut it""
Kate Alexander (?), (??????????) state
We ain't finished that, bitch bring that cake (?)
Great Lake inheritor, fit me for the crown
Hoes used to spin me, now look how they turn around
Niggas 33, so mad at me
Had a deal forever, ain't known in the D
But I'm still on the ground, heavy in the streets
Ask your A and R, he might know about me

8 Mile,The Hybrid: Cutting Room Floor  ,2010,"Same nigga, notebook full of rhymes
My nigga ace the face saw the signs
My talent level excel my age
So about age 9, knew that I would rock stage
So it made me think of grades, sort of like catching AIDS
Didn't hit class, I wrote in my notepad
Mimic what I heard, got sicker with the verbs
Figured this the quickest way to get the picket in the 'burbs
Distribute herb, admit I used to dabble, but dawg
The snares a better sound than the gavel
Got so damn hungry, with work I used to travel
Packets in some drawers, toothpaste in the packets
Tryna leave my habitat, in ways that I've adapted
Sleep different when you on somebody else's mattress
Mental got scarred, change the pace could be advantage
Everybody in the D tryna move to Atlanta

Click your seat fool, get ready to ride
And say good bye we 'bout to go past 8 mile
Brace yourselves only the strong survive
If you alive, we 'bout to go past 8 mile
Its too happy, hope your heater is dated
Are you ready? we 'bout to go past 8 mile
Tired of hating with the changes I'm making
I've been waiting just to go past 8 mile

It's where the line divide, either side, kinda tell get a sense of your pride
Where everyone ain't the same, but in the D that's how it is
How can you judge one from where one is?
The hook be on some other shit, checking our ID's
Hey fellas go back over the 8
Used to talk to white girls that I knew I couldn't date
Cause we was outta bounds, if we met either way
Now tell me what's the call
When we still gotta go over there to hit the mall
So I'm a take this d shit far
I'm the hybrid meaning sun take a hit past ours
As the summer's get hotter, winter get colder
Sons get locked, and our daughters having daughters
Feel its time to speak, before this shit be out of order
Before you be the nigga out here begging for quarters",https://genius.com/Danny-brown-8-mile-lyrics

So nigga you pussy, Wrap that kushy
Your girl wanna suck it like 7-11 slushie
So give me that gushy, funky, nasty stuff
Israel like Nazareth, meaning he is real
Nigga your beat's like a cheap x pill
Mean nothing to me like a lonely cheap thrill
True plus real equals a trill, and minus your bitch ass
Bound to drown like toddlers in advanced swim class
Drink a bitch quick like fat hoes do Slim Fast
All my bitches ballin' in the D like Swin Cash
And she brings that paper
Shake that ho like ultimate warrior do the ropes
If she moves slow with the dough
Fire that bitch, hire a new ho
Danny Brown a hybrid
Sort of like a pirate off acid

Smoking that cough that'll fuck up your sinus
Heater with me sorta like that blanket and Linus

And I don't need a hook for this shit
Cuff my balls, Suck my dick
Nigga I'm the shit, call me Pull-ups
And when the hoes see me, they all pull up
They take a flick with me, My pic in her iPhone
Ten seconds later, my dick in her jaw bone
And she say ""Ow, it feels good""
She says ""Brown, you're so hood""
So what's good? Whatcha don't know?
I like my ho fast that ride dick slow
Bitches online, I call 'em free throws
Shoot it on her like Jordan on Craig Ehlo
Nigga no homo, Nigga I'm him
Rap like Three Stacks mixed with Em,
 
where's Kim?
Probably in the D just like me
If you fight like Bruce Lee, I'mma kill you in your sleep

Radio Head,UnKnown,UnKnown,"I don't wanna rap with ya
Molotov the studio, hot tracks nigga
I sip liquor with bitches that owe tuition
After this they kiss n' strippin in the 69 position
And I came a long way from the dirty matress flippin
Malnutrition, now im comming in fruition
So fuck your superstitions
I wear the coolest stitchings
I've got that Hoover Crip vs Piru adrenaline
With the mind of Einstein at Columbine
Like Jefferson fist fighting with Edison
I knock your lights out
I take a shit in the white house and don't flush
Then pull my dick out on oprah....
Be like ""i gotcha bitch""
Now thats real talk not fucking Dave Chappelle skits
And I bet you she be wetter than some whale piss
I put it in her pelvis and now I'm eating sword fish
Blowin circles of purple knowing nothin's for certain
Fuck the wiser surgeon bust a nut on their curtains
Everyday always stay on the low like im thirsting
Niggas handcuffin nurses and buyin em' purses
Fuck buyin em burkins they worthless like cursive
My purses is purchest I'm the one that they flirt with
The surface is circus clowns
My verses is curses
I cop it and break it down
The workers are chirpin
Leader of the newschool in an old school
Niggas tofu, bruise off the pro-tools
Rap Meyer Lansky, losing all his sanity
Layin' on a canopy, thinkin how it can be
Player hating niggas allways blocking like Camby
Take the mocho out of man now he's just a randy
Blowin on the candy
Modus operandi
Adderals and zanny
Always come in handy, yeah
I'm on the streets like a wino
I see that pussy just like a gyno
Got these bitches chargin head first like rhino
Remember when they used to rock madana's with the rhynestones
Now they lookin like the shitted out a pinecone
Diamond in the ruff been found and its a fine stone
Fine two flow going over heads ho
Mind been blown ever since she gave me head ho",https://genius.com/Danny-brown-radio-head-lyrics
Pockets Fat,Detroit State of Mind,2007,"My knots so big, hard to put on my jeans
Got the 87 Chevy and I ride so clean
They say 'why you do it like that cuz ?'
I like my pockets fat not flat

36 ways spitting like 34
Pockets so fat that my thighs look small
24 inches in a wood brand floor
Got the Chevy same color as a shrimp egg roll (nigga)
Smoke end so sticky full of velcro
... and money some bitches ...
A long way from living off Ramen noodles
And I don't fuck with your hoes like Joey Buttafuoco
Favorite denim stretch, huggin my licks
Not cause they tight, cause I'm getting that bread (yay-yah)
Bumpin' ... I don't fuck with ...
And your favorite rapper baby momma throw me the head
Heavy in the street with the work for the wholesale
Hoes on my dick, fake rappers on my coattails
Prepare for the takeover 'bout to lock it down
Give Motown a makeover


Baby momma wanna get a portion of the profit
Jack boys wanna give a portion to his pockets
Best bet is to stop it
Pushing voicemail while I'm smokin' on chronic
Levi’s, True Religion, Paper, Red Monkey
All gets tight when I'm putting that junk
Louivie kicks are a light colored junk
Some color as the weed as I'm rollin' my blunt
Everywhere in the D they know my name
Caught a case off weed but I sold cocaine
Rock an outfit that cost more than your chain
Riding in a Chevy cost more than your brain
Used to wear my brothers pants
Now in these pockets it's 25 grands
Need a ... cell phone in my hand
Used to serve fiends now I serve fans


Right here lights niggas stay on the ..
Chevy sent high taller than my teeth
The way your boy hustle I don't get no sleep
And these niggas stay hatin' and I stay with their heat
Fucking with Brown, a nigga destined for death
Stay with the cash, care less about a check
Fuck a credit card, man, I stay with the yards
Got bitches on my dick for what I do with the RAs
Skinny nigga pockets probably weigh more more than me
Niggas show respect, I'm the real OG
Hustle all night, no time for sleep
I'm a pretty nigga, y'all can't eat
Sipping brown with a bitch from Seven Mile
Heavy nigga got more stripes than an argyle
Better go and do your homework
Go and check my rap sheet

Contra (DSOM4 Version),Detroit State of Mind 4,2010,"""Now I know what I'm gonna do, I said I know""

From the hood where them niggas pack fullys
Turn an ounce of reg to a cutty
Count money with a 10 deep flannel on
SB's looking like they been painted on
Jeans fitting like they was made for me
Your pants looking like, they was hand-me-downs from your Daddy
Get at me, my fit worth a stacky
I'm in a Caddy getting head in the back seat
Rubbing on her yakki
Then it start raining, when I start cumming
So now I'm brainstorming, on how I'm gon' run it
And y'all like fags – pussy? You don't want it
Gosh darn it, got heat like furnace
And I raise it like thermostat
Rolling that Thundercat kush look like Panthro
Heard you grab your ankles, take it in your manhole
That's so disgusting, I think I just threw up in my mouth
Can somebody pass me a towel?
A wetnap or something? Nigga is you fronting?
I beat you in your face, now your head like a pumpkin
Jack-o-Lantern,
 
I'm Danny Tanner
Watching that white girl, you a dry jheri curl
You worthless piece of shit
Your baby mama begged me to suck my dick
And I ain't gon' let her, she look like Predator
You a gay boy like David Archuleta
Contra, where niggas pierce armor
It's two niggas, two guns, blowing out your conscience
You see them chrome 44's, in this bitch with thirty men
Y'all niggas know the code like..

Feel like I got a code in like I got 50 lives
Know they wanna see the Hybrid die
But my eyes never close to meet death's cousin
I ain't never slipping, even when I'm buzzing
Staying on my guard like a boxer on a rope
You get fucked quick tryna play me like a ho
Don't act like you ain't know that, I flash it like Kodak
Now your pics is on obituary
You a fairy that touch nigga's nuts
Think he's been sniffing his own pixie dust
I think Biggie said that was rule #5
Never get high on your own supply
But he ain't never listened to Ready to Die
Or Life After Death,
 now he sharing living space
Tell Big we love his soul
But right now Danny Brown ""Unbelievable""",https://genius.com/Danny-brown-contra-dsom4-version-lyrics
Squeeze Precisely,Hot Soup,2008,"Paint a perfect picture
Brown like Picasso on purple, sippin' on liquor
The K spit fast like Chip Fu
Six foot nigga, but the chopper cost 6 2
Brown kick it like FIFA
Hood rat bitch, I don't fuck with a diva
Take her to the mall, let her get fitted
Put the D on her head like a Tiger fitted
The four-five dirty
Sixteen bars, same value as a birdy
Born broke, die rich, float birds, 
flip bricks
Sitting in a cutty with the chrome on a stick shift
These niggas might be the feds
44 long, fold a nigga like pita bread
I'm too old for a fist fight
Pop shit, burn a nigga's crib like double's night

I squeeze precisely
Where them niggas at?
Them niggas ain't like me
See the problem is, I'm way too nice, please
Where that money at? Fuck where it might be

Drop science like teenage pregnancy
In a cutty, same color as some celery
Flow felony, ain't in my pedigree
Y'all ain't fucking with me like celibacy
Spent a hundred on a collar bone
Danny Brown got white like styrofoam
The only you thing you running is your legs
Got gan by the boat, why you blowing on regs?
Won't fall for a bitch, stand up to the judge
Always Clarks, never rock a pair of Lugz
Middle of attention, center of attraction
Got the streets listening, feds, they tappin'
I give hell to a break beat
Fuck a dutch nigga, pass me a Swisher Sweet
Come at Brown, don't come at no bullshit
Bring extra rounds, need more than a full clip

I squeeze precisely
Where them niggas at?
Them niggas ain't like me
See the problem is I'm way too nice, please
Where that money at? Fuck where it might be

You know we tell it like it is, right?
Talk shit 'til these pussy niggas want to fight
Sleep days, making moves in the moonlight
""Niggas mad because I know that Cash Rules""
Yeah, you know we tell it like it is, right?
Talk shit 'til these pussy niggas want to fight
Sleep days, making moves in the moonlight
H.O.J. is the crew, right?

The same, just hype, two niggas with mics
Gun talk on safety, we ain't too puss' to fight

Aiyyo you motherfucking right, I don't claim to be
Cause I am who I am, pretty soon you gon' see

Guess it is what it is then, we can shoot the five
Been deprived so long, just lucky to be alive
Won't be survived by a wife and son

And no I won't be removed from this space 'til I'm done
The undisputed one, pound for pound, second round
They say third times a charm, I'm liking how it sound

Haters wipe me down from my fitted to my shoes
Been paid my dues, bruh check the interviews

Cause I'm on, niggas like he been on the cusp
Been blazing trails, been leaving dust

Now we on the road to riches and finer things

SWEENEY SONG,CLASSIC DRUG REFERENCES VOL.1,2013,"Check!
Yeah...

Nine out of ten of these rap niggas is Play-Doh
I say ""Go!"", niggas spray your whip like Maaco
Ya got that yayo for the low, you'd swear that Kanye was here
The way they say ""where did 'Ye go?""
My flow strong like it's on that shit Canseco on
I don't eat rappers, I box them up like take-home
Get straight dome from a bi bitch
I don't know her name, but told her girlfriend to switch
And the lyrics coalesce, I'll rip the labyrinths
Hazardous material that's oh so immaculate
Accurate position, when I spit this shit, it's calculus
Hard, nigga...
And that was bars, nigga...
I'm off them Xany footballs, nigga
Swisher, I don't buff, kush shuffs 'til I fall, nigga
Too high to fuckin' talk...
That's why I never call a nigga...
Your bitch keep textin' and she want it all, nigga...
Yeah!

And I got two on a brew
Let's go cup-for-cup until that ma'fucka through
And I got five on the bag
Before you toss that square, can a nigga get a drag?
And I used to spend late nights staring at the ceiling
Pitch-black dark, but I had that feelin'
Vision of killin' niggas, being labelled a villain
Because these labels passed, I'mma make these niggas pass

Late night, searching on websites for victims
Fuck doing features, you niggas competition
That's your assistant on a blunt run?
Give her stomach blows till I puncture her lungs
And it's some nigga shit I fuck with - in my spare time
But they can't fuck with me in my mind
Used to be humble, now I'm feelin' cocky
Cause all these bitches ride it like a fuckin' Kawasaki
And these rap niggas see my face in they dreams
They worst fuckin' nightmare wearin' fuckin' skinny jeans
Wake in cold sweat, my reflection in the mirror
Put a curse on a Freshman 10, watch how it end
Dropped out of high school at sixteen
'Bout the same time as the Wu dropped ""Ice Cream""
Arguin' with fiends, starin' at the screen
Watchin' Rap City like it was all a dream
Spent my last three bucks on a Source magazine
Hip-Hop Shop where niggas was battlin'
But I was writin' shit in my fuckin' composition
Knowin' one day I would have these critics trippin'
Sayin' that: ""Niggas, I'mma be the future""
New take on rap, this ain't what ya used to
Push the shit fucking forward
Focus on the music, show the people what's important
A load on my shoulder, filla a whole world
Meetin' my goal, watch my plans unfurl

Check!
Yeah!
Ahn!

And I got two on this brew
Let's go cup-for-cup till this motherfucker through

Want you to snitch so they can hit the jackpot

But they don't tell you bout the rock with the

Back in 2000 and niggas still poor
Matter fact crack ain't even poppin' no more
Now your best bet is fucking with the trees
Don't slang for what you want, slang for what you need
A-Town niggas talking bout they flipping keys
Detroit run Atlanta nigga ask Big Meech

Niggas in my city always talking bout the bag
Never sold crack, just the crack of their ass
Flip more stones than a fucking archaeologist
Smart like scholarships to two colleges
Skipped class had to quench my thirst
Now i'm jumping fiends who ain't pay me on the first
Rocks in my socks, jeans 
Remember having dreams I ain't never coming home
Lost in the streets can't find my way
Hit 
Getting paid while my ho's kiss J's

Platinum flight pods is copped off Eastbay
I don't give a damn what she or he say
Niggas always stuck on he say she say
The game getting nasty out there, nigga, be safe
Money make it hard for young hoes to keep faith
You niggas live envy, smoke trash, and sleep hate
Y'all ain't balling, you're cheapskates
Listen, I'll show you what the value of a dollar mean
Time for me to throw the mask on like it's Halloween
You ain't got a lot of fiends, you just got a lot of dreams
With beef, then cop them things it's not a thing
Shots is spring like bada boom bada bing

D Brown, pump like Reebok
Y'all niggas bums, y'all pump that sheet rock
Y'all too ugly, Rocksteady and Bebop
Me- I smoke it look like a peacock
Your girl a hoe, she drank my semen
All cause I told her I'll take her to Eastland
Bitch nigga jump, get cracked like a pecan
Brown too dazed nigga this where the weak end
Eight 16's, skipping school up in Prestige
Y'all niggas soft like a batch of wet leaves
Brown town mix that Nestle

Matter of fact, I shoot- Call me Danny Dick Out
Nigga I back out, spit till the finish
Have a nigga look like Reggie Dennis

Plus I'm too fresh, rocking bandanas is lame
I ain't a hustla, that's trying to box me in
I mean I hustle but who don't? If you not, you tripping
And you? You ain't dope enough
The 50 Caliber will crack your whole coconut
Uh no milk, just the cherry filling
Shoot a hater in the head, yeah it's very thrilling
I'm in a European car, panoramic ceiling
Staring at the sun, through the transition
I ain't kill that man, nor did my man shoot him
We put bullets in the air, that silly nigga ran into em

I leave your rib cage transparent

Raised round on block cheese and boxed raisin
Use four buckets of water to take a bath
Embarrassed 'bout hunger, lying saying I pass
Yesterday's clothes, yellow teeth when I cheese
Nothing on the weed but let me hit them trees
And do you got another square? See my pockets is bare
You look in my face all you see is despair
And a newport will take the load off for a minute
Fuck the radio, don't watch TV it's all gimmicks
Mom got welfare, still hard, got a job
Turn around and lock her up for welfare fraud
Sister had a third abortion, got six kids
What's crazy, she only twenty-six
My brother lost his daughter, she was only four months
So what the fuck I'm 'posed to do but sit and smoke blunts

Selling rocks since the days of Nintendo
Lock them ? reaking like endo

Using my timberland for a pillow
Neck throbbing, feel like I slept on an armadillo

But that was then, now I'm back on the block
Fitted cock like Curtis in a comet
White powder, motherfucker it ain't common
So strong, make the hardest fiend vomit

Used to wear shoe strings for belts
Same damn Guess jeans, worn out checks
Sleeping on couch beds, crooks in my necks

It's dangerous in the D, beware of 7 Mile players
East don’t like the West, the West say the East is some haters
Gator haven, old school whips, chrome plated
Color-coordinated fabrics, Cartier glasses, yes!
It's the home of them dudes that's fantastic, yes!
They'll bust in your attic and start blasting
Looking for that ganj' you better have it fast
Bitch-ass, we ask last and then smash
Pass the cops, I don't give a fuck I'm playin'
Conscious niggas hold pistols in Detroit
This ain't Orange County, nigga, this is Detroit
And I'm a D-boy I'm building the ""estroy""
Home of the Lords and the motherfucking Cheddar Boys
Hex murderer, trick-trick
We click-click, boom
And let the pistols clear the room, I assume
Come to my city, you better holla

Just enough Bacardi but this is how we party
Probably step in the joint for some Henny and some Coke
Part of my code, I prolly got a nina in my coat
Gucci  heads up on my toe, I'm a goat
Plus the cash that I throw is like it never touch the floor
 Yeah, such a professional
The blow and the 'dro in the floor near the dresser drawer
Take us as jealous, ho, dare you to touch it, though
Violence start piling we ain't smilin'
Don't you hear them violins, somebody must have died and
Nobody couldn't survive that moment of silence, uh

Talking gun play, but you never made it happen
Talking 'bout work, but your never sold a capsule

Hit you with high numbers, say they tryna show you love

'Bout to kill the game like Marvin picking needles up

Sitting at his typewriter, I'm that type of writer
Three houses left on the 10 house block
That's four abandoned houses and three empty lots
Nightfall look like Iraq
Arabs at the store, fronting words like they black
Keep the latest Nikes on my feet, swisher after swisher just so I can go to sleep
Wars outside, we stay in and play Live
A walk to the store could be the end of your life
Niggas be running through the block shooting
Time to stack up so we can move in on the outskirts of Houston
Niggas here like to rob, kickin' doors in for nothing
So watch where you go, 'cause you might get stuck-in
Caught offguard, niggas see ya, kick your ass in
You running like a cheetah from a masked assassin
Heard a few chicks scream, arm extends, squeeze again
We don't fuck with heaters that jam, for you this is the end
When I pop it, and that bullet exits the chamber
Surely ya'll confound me, conjecting your life's in danger
So in a hospital lobby, your family'll never be able to see as high as you see
So what you saying?
See the game ain't the same
Got younger niggas holding these triggers, bringing fame to their name
His crew should fuck it, neat rims for the summer
Bun some corn or, Ray-bans they run up on a 25's again; tins of AriZona
Bundles of rock, only job on the block
Snitches on the block
So don't serve 'til the motherfucking daylight stop
Because these base-heads, all they care about is a rock
And the nark will give them some just so they can go cop
I really need a vacation, so vacant, mind vacate a serious irritation
Compare my CDs to the face of the depths
Breathing starts fuming, he's noticing his breath
Laid back, reminisce the time
Nothing happen here, it's a Detroit state of mind
Detroit state of mind, Detroit state of mind

Been having dreams that I'm famous
On tours, fucking whores
Cash every day, eating good, staying full
Away from the block
Never ever thinking of selling rocks
Winning awards and getting props
Then I wake up
Thinking if I'm ever gon' take up
Stack enough loot, get my mum out the hood
I ain't walking round thinking shit is all good
Give me the right amount and I might sign with Shook
Thinking of bank rolls, gain, and chill spots
A little more stress and I just might pill-pop

Pyrex pot still feed our babies
Crackhead moms sell dick for fixes
Forced to sell rocks, due to our conditions

Still hiding work in my grandma's ceiling
Old school stash in a Crown Royal bag

Still scream, though his momma say, ""never leave the backyard""
Niggas out shooting, used condoms on the playground
Stay 'round crackheads, squatting out vacant flats
Teen girls getting raped, man it's all fact
Hooks swoop up, take your money and your crack
Might get your weed back, put your ass out the back
Starvin', narcs comin' we chalking
Run up, stash the work, get the guns out the closet
Seen niggas in the county get they brains stomped out
While the dep's did nothing they just stood there and watched
Tired of Coney, motor city got me lonely
For security, I got the .40 on me
Crib's rent unpaid, bills in the mailbox
Letter from your cousin on the bloc, man it stay hot
Most niggas I grew up with that are locked up
Are lost to a trap, leave their ass, stuck
And most souls I know got babies or a lady
Never met a old chick that tell me that she married
It's crazy in a city where there's money to gamble
But lookin' at the scenery, it's all in shambles
I lay back, reminisce on earlier times
There's nothing happy here, it's a Detroit state of mind

When the moon come out, and the sun don't shine
I be on the corner all day continuing the grind
When the sun comes up that just let me know the time
There's nothing happy here, it's a Detroit state of mind

At the Cabernet, late night, saturday
Tight fitted, drunk off hennessey, I put the gat away
I'm nervous 'bout it cause these niggas lookin' kinda strange
As I have them very thoughts, niggas got it in the brain
I'm headed for the exit, while I'm slipping on champagne
Kicking bottles on the floor, I'm just trying to hit the door
And everybody else too ain't tryna get trampled
Heard two shots, tripped, and twisted my ankle
And we can never party, a bunch of hatin' niggas
In a city that's corrupted with some grimey-ass bitches
Could be your best friend or even your relative
Snitch on you or put the .40 in your grill
And nigga that ain't right, 
niggas your whole life
When you get locked won't send you a kite
I lay back, reflect, think of earlier times
There's nothing happy here, it's a Detroit state of mind",https://genius.com/Danny-brown-detroit-state-of-mind-pt-2-lyrics
Get On The Grind,Detroit State of Mind,2007,"I got a 8 ball in the corner of my sock
Ain't gotta jump shot, so I gotta sell rocks
The middle of the block, where we all copping clock
Hook guys on you, even when you cop a squat
The nights so long and the days real short
Game of cat and mouse so I puff a newport
To take away the stress, the sess in my chest, gives me the strength to go on
Life's been short man I'm tryna 'void cort, wanna break me down but I'm too strong
I got my mind on my money and my money on my mind
Something on my wrist the only way I'm doing time
I eat grilled fish with grino piszo wine
Sitting in a new v with the seats reclines
Smoke weed everyday just to ease my mind
Tryna live the good life, cos I ain't tryna do time, and I'm
 x2
Why's my niggas always yelling out broke shit
Let's get money cos now you wanna smoke shit
Chill dawg, naa nigga get money
Get on your grind, ain't a damn thing funny

I won't change for money, money change for me
Niggas all broke, wanna plot on me
Cos I'm in the hood, no rocks on me
Smartest nigga they know without a G.E.D
Used to hustle all night, going half on hogees
Me and my nigga going half on Oz's
Now I ride around in a thing with no lease
With rich white niggas, still fuck with parole lease
Outta Detroit like Alan Houston
, I been NY but I ain't no bum
I'm from where motherfuckers is shooting, I used to cut up and save the crumbs
See it ain't where you from, it's where you at
The perception of my city, I'm a straight and a fax
Browntown motherfucker, yeah I'm taking it back
And do anybody got a fucking problem with that?
 x2

But the weed in the bag right then get money
Prims on that new shit, then you get honey
When niggas start hating, then you get funny
Cos when ribs was showing, they didn't feel tummy
See, you gotta do what you gotta do
And they gotta do what they gotta do
See, you ain't concerned with me, I ain't concerned with you
You don't give a fuck, then nigga, fuck you
I don't need you, you don't need me
I don't fuck with you, you don't fuck with me
I help feed niggas who help feed me
Show love on GP, now I gotta please me
If it all end today, I still be pleased
Smoke weed, drink liquor just to get a release
The way shit going it'll never be peace
Tryna keep a piece mind so I keep my piece

Just gotta' keep it 100
Fuck 'em

I keeps it 100, 100 on the streets
Pay a couple hundred get a nigga put to sleep
I keeps it 100, 100 on the tree
100 on the drink, come fuck with a G

Niggas is tough guys, they act real hard
Until it's on deck and you gotta' pull their card
See niggas will fold and my niggas ain't bluffing
Nigga you front, I'll take the top off your muffin
And I ain't no super-thug, nothing like that
I know any day I could easy get got
I been through the brawls nigga I done seen it all
10 on 1's, left bloody in my drawers
But nigga I come back, it ain't no thing
Catch a nigga slipping when he out tryna' hang
You go to the club nigga get that ass clubbed
Beat to fucking death with a fucking car glove


I keeps it 100, niggas think they stuntin'
Niggas come around with all that pussy ass frontin'
Nigga you'll get stomped, pushed with the pump
Beat, stripped ass ho naked in the trunk
Bitch you in the back, nigga we in the front
Fully automatic MP5 I'm a thug
Got a problem with the D? Then I'm suggesting you jump
We gon' keep it 100 leave you with 100 lumps
Now you walk around sick looking like you've got the mumps
Stanky bitches you running with, them niggas punks
They talk real bad, nigga it ain't shit
State pen and corners Danny Brown and Trick Trick

See niggas is hard heads until they get taught
A motherfucking lesson then they ass get caught
For thinking that it's sweet like Mickey D's sweet tea
And you gon' see how easy I squeeze
This ain't no rap shit this more like a letter
To any stupid nigga that don't know better
So you gon' learn, get taught a quick lesson
Get your ass burned, bullets will have your flesh melting
You know I'm a G, you can see it in my eyes
You come to the D you'll get young burgularised
And that ain't no threat it's more like a promise
I'll put that on coupe, I'll put that on my Mama",https://genius.com/Danny-brown-keeps-it-100-lyrics
Black,Detroit State of Mind 4,2010,"Dawg you ain't know I'm on some other shit
Not like no nigga, I'm a psycho like no nigga
That don't keep no rifle nigga
Michael Tyson mind-frame when he won the title nigga
Knock out ya grill like you was chewin' loads of peanut brittle
Bitch look like she seen a whistle
Wanna' slurp and lick on me like I'm some sort of popsicle (popsicle)
Tickle me she said I look like Snoop Dizzle
Asked me if I wanted head I said ""Fo' shizzle nizzle'
Back up on my grizzle grizzle, pistol and an instrumental
This a detrimental utter lack of fundamentals
You ain't never seen probation, you ain't never seen parole
I rock 'em, sock 'em robot nigga
Keep it moving, toe to toes, broke the mould, poke your holes
Poke your nose and polar flows
Twist a nigga leave him salty like a bag of Rold Gold
44 cold blows, all it took was low blows
Now a nigga fucked up morning toilet seat cold
Used to be fucked up rocks in dunta-dun-daduns
End of money credit living waiting on the first to come
Nigga I will run up on (?)
Now you got tubes in your mouth, Roger Troutman
Nigga you ain't got a choice, used to sound like Barry White
Now it's T-Pain voice
But where Berry Gordy used to crack the top 40's
Now we crack 40's telling yesterday's stories
Eenie-meenie-minie-mo, been on the Calico
In results of taddle-toe
Jump (?) from Mighty Joe
Hidey-hidey-hidey-ho
Cab Calloway ya ho
'Bout doe, if you ain't about money what you came for?
Surgery with chainsaws, nigga I will bang y'all
Catch a nigga Christmas Eve, head leaking Eggnog
Bite a nigga jaw off, while I got the sawed-off
Because you ass and pussy like a bitch with her drawers off",https://genius.com/Danny-brown-black-lyrics
Yo Lovin’,Detroit State of Mind,2007,"Yo Lovin..

Wish I could take you back to my younger days
Feet pajamas, oatmeal off the microwave
Way back when I used to watch cartoons
Now I just rock the same shit like cartoons
For the last buck with the chronic
I was posted at the crib, fruit snacks and Sonic
Now I'm posted in the spot with sacks and Tonic
Serve the high school kids before home economics
With a mind full of money and a heart full of change
Gotcha nigga puffing loosies skip home, a thang
Don't take it as a diss if a nigga don't speak
It's just... a lot on my mind this week
Gave my nigga four years so I smoke more blunts
And the nigga that snitched got 36 months (fuckin' snitch)
...what goes around come back
Tryna make the beat cry put my life on the track
Sit in Champion hood, split a swisher down the middle
Nikes in the snow, bloc hot like a griddle
Gotta get it, no matter what the season
Missed my PO day gotta come up with a reason
My granny die, already used that fuck it
Let the dice know, sipping the henney straight back
Roll another sack gotta get my mind right
Hit the booth spit the truth like Walter Cronkite
I'm a heavyweight, guns make you levitate
Bout to get the D back crackin' like '88

Old school chevy with the michigan plates
4 15's rattle trunk in the back
Riding round Linwood with my strap
Niggas say Brown on some gangster shit
At the liquor store rolling blunts with your bitch
She said ""Brown let me suck your dick""
Pulled my dick out and she sucked my dick
Brown rubber bands rapped around my nine
Ridding round dirty nigga fuck the cops
Tryna stack up maybe cop me a drop
So I go hard on the block with the rocks
Hour after hour I'mma make me a sale
Minutes getting used on the burnout sale
Tank on F so im riding the block
Bending corners in the Cutty all the hoes on my jock

Riding round the hood with the trunk on Bang
Nigga ain't crippled but I stay with the Cane
Riding round the hood with the trunk on full
4 15's banging in my trunk
I raised down the window
Hit the blunt twice then toss the endo
Now pass another Swisher Sweet
While I finger your bitch in the passenger seat
Im a Detroit nigga on some Detroit Shit
A bitch don't choose me, I choose my bitch
Low and behold I dun fucked your girl
Red busto's with ?????????????????
Blowing on a blunt while she's sucking me off
Her teeth scraped my dick then my shit got soft
Told her be cool I ain't gon trip bitch
Know you never sucked on a dick this big
Bonafied hustler with the work on call
Delivering with 8 balls in my draws
Nigga owe me money I'mma beat you stupid
You're listening to that real D-boy music

Tea Time,The Hybrid: Cutting Room Floor  ,2010,"I sit and drink some tea with grandma
And talk about how much she isn't getting
We just pray, hope the blessings collect
Yesterday I missed the call from my cousin collect
He upstate, I hope I catch him on another day
But I ain't trying to see him, in a fuckin' round with the gay
One look at my granny, I thought for sure sinking
Damn... you know what I'm thinking
Nah.... I see you're kinda slow
Cause I ain't serving shit, but this flow
And this beat is like a pack, flow like crack
I'mma do 'em one better, flip this sect
So these bars is fat nickels, got my first sale
Bought the kids popsicles, the game's so fickle
Got me going and my lawyer fair to cop swishers
Narcs pull us over, talking 'bout where's the pistols
And all we tryna do is just get a couple conies
Cause ain’t shit in the crib man we lucky wit bologna
Lonely inside living in a quarter house
Bunch a niggas pressed like a church lady blouse
Wonder why all these niggas running to the south
But in these 60's niggas came to where?
Wonder why all these motherfuckers running to the south
Cause in the 60's our elders came from there
Yeah...

I sit and drink some tea with grandma
And talk about how much we isn't getting
We just pray, hope the blessings collect
Yesterday got a call from my cousin collect
He upstate, said he straight, niggas locked
Quotin' bars from my mixtape
But I'm far from paid, and the bills don't fade
So if you don't play might be locked in the cage
Nah I play the stage, and the hour's never flexible
Been doing this since granny made me eat my vegetables
Threw away my school schedule...
These niggas lack testicles...
Say what they want, don't do what they feel
Sometimes I look at shit like is it really real?
Same question Meth asked in '94
Had the Hilfiger bubble coat...
Crushed on Tiffany but she wasn't feeling me
Cause she was in the 12th grade sipping on Hennessey
Now she a memory of what she once was
Cause if you see her no you wouldn't touch her with a buzz
That's fucked up",https://genius.com/Danny-brown-tea-time-lyrics
Intro,Detroit State of Mind 3,2009,"Niggas don't want no beef
I'm in a bake potato cutty with the sour cream seats
Window down, no A/C
Goin' anywhere my instinct take me
Mojo back, so ""oh behave""
A nigga get left like batman cave
Nowhere to be found, gan by the pound
Sort of like Rodman how I rebound
Fresh off a county been came home broke
Now I'm in the back of the drop like the pope
Blowin' on some kush, it look like smush
That's black, purp, and yellow, it tastes like jello
No medicare but the flow's so sick
Cause Brown got grain like a hot pot of grits
Your girl gave me head and cooked a bullshit breakfast
And that pussy bow like that weave down in Texas
I play the game no coaches
Brown done been through more raids than roaches
My bitch eat pills like M&M's
Give me head, say it taste like cinnamon

I can sell heat to a camel, ice to a penguin
Bread to a bird, nigga you ain't heard?
From the first to the third, I'mma get my money
Rain, hail, snow, double up when it's sunny
See us with a ho, no we straight bust, owed her
Say we gon' pay her when we finish, and we older
Earn his own jeans with the AirMax laced up
Sing so high you can tell that I'm caked up
I open doors like Benson
Nigga I'm the truth like Jesus' opinion
Rain on the moonroof, smud shotgun
Tellin' me a story 'bout her ex caught a hot one
It's all good
Put my dick through her mouth like screw through her wood
Popped three pills then the bitch got loose
Run me for a hour then lick off the juice",https://genius.com/Danny-brown-intro-lyrics
Two Steps Back,Hot Soup,2008,"Seen niggas lose lives over eight ball money
Seen crack babies grow up to serve their mommy
Can't explain why we live with so much sorrow
Guess the stories of today'll be a movie tomorrow
Mama always said there'd be days like this
Ain't got my own pot so in the alley I piss
I'll risk my own life to be rich
Workin' like a slave for them chains and whips
I daydream around palm trees
Blowin' haze in the day, summertime breeze
But in reality I just blow my breath
Let the Michigan cold numb my flesh
I need a tissue 'cause my nose is runnin'
Faced harsh winters, locked hot summer
Fuck the president, and the next running
None of them niggas gon' let me hold something

I take one step forward and two steps back
Nobody gets nowhere like that
I take one step forward and two steps back
Nobody gets through life like that
I take one step forward and two steps back
Nobody gets through life like that
Take one step forward and two steps back
Nobody gets nowhere like that

At night I lay in bed and just pray I can sleep
Think about my life with the TV on the blink
Starin' at the ceiling, I just think
""Should I write my own will?"" but I ran outta ink
Ask God questions almost every day
I almost get my answers a damn year later
I rolled in (...) (...)
Spit for crack babies
Layin' incubators
This is for my niggas workin' nine to five
They wanna beat they boss ass but they gotta survive
For the ones who hustle, had to slow up
'Cause they wanna be around and see their kids grow up
My boy got a chain for his 13th birthday
Went to school, niggas jumped him the next day
Truthfully, they took his honesty
'Cause now my nigga locked up for two armed robberies

One step forward and two steps back
Nobody gets through life like that
I take one step forward and two steps back
Nobody gets nowhere like that
I take one step forward and two steps back
Nobody gets through life like that
I take one step forward and two steps back
Nobody gets nowhere like that

Yeah-yuh
That's how it is sometimes, you know
Shout out to all my niggas with they dreams tho' man
Don't give up
You gotta keep movin' man

We gon' make it outta this shit man...",https://genius.com/Danny-brown-two-steps-back-lyrics
Counterfeit,Detroit State of Mind 4,2010,":
I'm feelin' kinda sick
Shorty cause my last flip got hit with some counterfeit
Whole damn hundred
Must of been desperate
Be out here bein' greedy, so the line I didn't check it
So I'm sittin' in the spot
Countin' on my knot
Pistol on the flo' while I'm sittin' on the couch
Then I heard a knock
I know this bet' not
I was so damn excited I forgot to grab the Glock
Snatched open the do'
Gave my dawg the nod
And pieced his ass up while he was reachin' for that do' nob
Grabbed his head and kneed him in his chin
Put 'em in a headlock, kicked him in the shin
Got him on the ground
Hands on the throat
But guess what the fuck this nigga started reachin' fo'?
Lucky for me my nigga peeped him, changed the moment
Cause at that very point, shit went in slow motion
Picked up the heater
Cocked that bitch back
Squeezed two times saw a real bright flash
""Tat tat""
Then the fiend started screamin'
Ran out the apartment with his right calf leakin'
Then we chase after
Heater still smokin'
Caught him in the alley and let that bitch open
""Tat tat""
He squeezed two mo' at my man
And next thing we heard he gettin' picked up in an ambulance
Next day
Chillin' feelin' proper
We just smokin' some Mustafah
Hash in it, and we ain't even mention it
Around this time playin' 2K1
We were so young and dumb dawg we even kept the gun
And if we got caught dawg we would've got hung",https://genius.com/Danny-brown-counterfeit-lyrics
Succeed,Hot Soup,2008,"I take a blunt to the face late night watching (breath low?)
Pray for paper, writing rhymes about dope
Cause when a block's slow, tell me what's next
Wonder why I'm running in your crib with the tech
Hell with no job, unemployment having high fiend
If it ain't a crack rock, next day die
Hell to work they life and I really don't know
Why they wanna give it back to the damn casino
This world is a joke but I really can't laugh
Cause the tank kinda low, they killin' us for gas
Child support warrent, licensed bimbo
Tail light broke on the way to the store
Used to wear my daddy clothes sneaking in his closet
Now I can cop the winter line in August
Used to sell rocks now I can rock your baby mama
Hit her with a text, let her scoop me in the Honda

Give us any chance we'll take it
Read us any rule we'll break it
We're gonna make our dreams come true
Doin' it our way
Nothing's gonna turn us back now
Straight ahead and on the track now
We're gonna make our dreams come true
Doin' it our way
There's nothing we won't try
Never heard the word impossible
This time there's no stoppin' us
We're gonna do it
On your mark get set and go now
Got a dream and we just know now
We're gonna make that dream come true
And we'll do it our way
Yes our way
Make all our dreams come true
And we'll do it our way
Yes our way
Make all our dreams come true

It’s a Discription,Detroit State of Mind,2007,"You was raised off welfare, nursing on focused hope
Pops left, young age, mom got her shoulder rope
Mom can't do that, mom's drunk off dope
Cold water bath, tic tac sized soaps
Sis' got pregnant, when she was young
Out here trickin' making you watch her son
Stolen cable BET stay on the screen
Never a dull moment, mom fight with other fiends
The happiest moment when you sleep and you dream
Then you wake up to the same old thing
Cereal no milk, dishes in the sink
Older brother runnin' 'round, gettin' money, wearing mink
Won't buy nothin' to eat, always buy drinks
Get the whole house drunk, then shit pop off
Momma boyfriend trippin' 'bout a dime got lost
Mind is lost, smoke a blunt, try to do (law?)
Seem fit to sell drugs, but you just too soft
Hard times at school because your peer is off
Too many roaches, might see a mouse
Extension cords get power from the neighbor's house
Got two pair of jeans, dead air, one's
Brother old coke square smoke in your lungs
The man of the house but your momma youngest son
Back to the wall, face to the wind
Ma's scratch the last of the number but don't win
Sister disappearing always leaving her kids
Tired of ramen noodles, you can see your ribs
Lot of sugar in the Kool-Aid keep your thirst quenched
Cigarettes and weed, make your eyes squint
Fridge empty, nothin' in the cabinet but spinach
And you ain't Popeye, livin' in a crowded house
Space heater keeps you warm, while you sleep on the couch
Bridge card every first, keep food in your mouth
Unless your mom sell 'em for drugs, and then you know
That month, shit gon' be fucked up
So you go to school, for the free lunch and stuff
But niggas teasing like you some type of punk and stuff
So you got kicked out for punching and stuff
Headaches at night, and your stomach is growling
Crack smoke in the air and the wolves is howling
...eviction notice on the door
...niggas sleepin' on the floor
...you can't take it no more
Just listen you can make it out
Just look at what's around you take a different route
If you don't have a dream, how could it come true?

Won’t Do,Detroit State of Mind 3,2009,"As the rim still spin
Bitches on my dick cause they know where I'm in
Said I was cute, but just too broke then
Catch me at the store with a Newport blowing
All the hoes start staring
Cutty same color as a dirty fish aquarium
And the seat's fruit punch
Cause I was selling bags when y'all was bringing bag lunch
Riding up Redwood, tryna catch a stunt
Drunk on bhang while I'm rolling up a blunt
Seen a nice thick bitch so I said, what up doe
Hopped right in, right front the corner store
Wanna get it popping but I told her just chill
Lemme roll another blunt while you pop another pill
Riding up the wood about to go to the crib
And I ain't even tripping cause she know where it is

Now we can just chill if you want to
Yea yea pop another pill if you want to
We can do whatever you won't do
See we can do whatever you won't do
See we can just chill if you want to
Yea yea pop another pill if you want to
We can do whatever you won't do
See we can do whatever you won't do

Now I came from nothing to something
Block done came back, but I'm still hustling
Wish I got money more sooner but
Fresh to death like I'm at my funeral
Took grits for the 26 inches
Pass when it was 4th and inches
Now they just fight for attention
See these niggas hating, but I ain't really tripping
Cause I'm doing my thing

Chase holes in the flip flops of Ottie
With some pretty pink toes and them real nice bodies

Cocaine Cowboy,Detroit State of Mind 2 ,UnKnown,"Detroit desperado, wrap  in a red El Dorado
My lifestyle's Fortune 500
While niggas just a crumb inside a world where the bread run it
I'm 16 from the slums
Street light reflect off the barrel of the gun
We expect death, lucky to reach puberty
Learned in the streets public school wasn't teaching me
Graduate with honours as a cocaine scholar
I sell nouns like pounds, birds like birds
Clowns ain't heard, words I serve
Spit like nicks, rhyme like dimes
Roll a dollar bill up snort these lines
Fresh off the curb on a quest for the bacon
Flip an occupation on the final destination
Daily operation, currency chasing
Got no patience
Daily operation, currency chasing
Got no patience for the pennies I ain't waiting

Fire in the Booth,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Frisbee at halo and ?
Recite God like like the rhymes written by angels
Born with the blood of an enraged slave
Caught fucking master wifey and got hung that day
That's why I fuck these white bitches like its payback
You old niggas playing games like Pat Sajak
Whipping up the Vanna White
Brought an extra ? back
The way my bitches looking you would think we at a horse track
Cos' the romanellis long way from Pelle Pelle's
Stacking in the telly with that next tall sally
Banging R Kelly, getting that ?
Now what I dick for a show, that first lick they hitting belly
Now tell me I ain't the crown of the nouns
Unleash furious verbs, make these peasants bown down
The presence of a legend every time i come round
Why in my face they smile when I turn my back they frown

Hypnotised like staring straight into a serpents eyes
Want it all in the bags, its like them fries at five guys
My eye size is pint sized, blind off the muy thai
? karate chop, slump leaning sideways
Chicken coop smokey on every other friday
One way driving down the wrong way of a highway
Getting fucked up in public coming down after binging
Never had class just after school detention
Did I mention, I'd still be teaching these niggas
Doing their danny brown rendition, but that shit ain't clicking
Tripping when im hitting off this backwood I'm hitting
Giggling when I listen to that ? they be kidding
? The way these niggas rapping's a shame
If they wasn't so lame I'd be saying they name
Get your own shit nigga trying to merge in my lane
Crash into another car avoiding the thrashing plane

Stressed out nigga 'bout to lose my mind
The whole damn time I've been thinking about crying
Cause' mind fucked up and I'm fucked up
So I get fucked up gone ?
? Don't waste my time
? Don't waste my time
Take this nick hit a lick get a dollar
Come back and see me been here this whole time
Smoking on gas thats toxic, say it flew in from the tropic
? just profit
Need that money because i need them boxes
Mind on the green like the ? Celtics
Nine tucked right by the pelvis
Fiends nodding off on the toilet like Elvis
Have a nigga thinking how the fuck do i sell this
'Cause i fucking need that money, hit that block couple miles and running
Gotta get them ten, twenties, fifties and hundreds
Have a nigga locked doing time doing dumb shit
So i gotta just think it smarter
Gotta get this money for my daughter
Dog this ain't the eighty nine ? in that cutlass and that shit have you locked before you even get started

I come from a dark past but guess what bitch got a bright future
These bitches feeling freaky because my diamonds going Kama Sutra
'Bout to make a power move, smoking on ?
Used to hustle in shower shoes until I got like I had my own shower shoes
Now these niggas got me on Igor, smell just like the seashore
Shots of my ? serving B more
I made 200 racks off a D-tour
On the interstate with them ? traffic
Stopped my ? but that spot still ? and bouncing
So much money I might need counselling
Had that forty in my Pelle Pelle

Got more wood than a fucking cabin
Inside white like sitting in napkins
26 inches nigga whats happening
Bout to get the paper like school supply shopping
Like police academy Brown  stay copping
Broke not an option flipping copping
So much grass you can run a toboggan
Bout to serve a nigga while i'm talking on my cellie
Ride 96 cash i'm blessed with
Rims scarp the frame coming off the carter exit

Old school Chevy on 26 inches
I don't do it for me man i do it for the bitches
I just do it for the hoes
Looking down on niggas sitting on 24s
26 inches looking down on y'all (x4)

Neighborhood jeans on top of the moccasins
Money in my pocket necessary like oxygen
Laying on a sports page
Bagged up the number of your age in 10th grade
Another day another dollar
Pushing the pedal on the Chevy with the Pradas
You sitting low on 24s
My Chevy higher than stdio 54
But i try to stay grounded
Keep a level head got money so i count it
 in that zip lock
Wood-grain dash
Candy cane flip flop
Hook on my ass
Bitches on my nuts
Niggas stay hatin'
But i don't give a fuck
Tell em catch me 
Bank rolls raining like money ain't a thing

Old school Chevy on 26 inches

Stay On,The Hybrid: Cutting Room Floor  ,2010,"(Verse 1: Danny Brown)
*adlib*
I will throw you out the window, blaze up some indo
Cut on Ron Browz; Jumpin' Out The Window
The hook come for info. Ask 'em what they here for
Just tell 'em he was listening to Ron Browz
Bob your head. Nigga, don't fight it
I could take a shit in Autotune and you'll like it
Cause good times is far from what I had
Used to look at Thelma like ""She ain't that bad""
So cop another bag, break a pill in half
And eat that motherfucker like a cow do grass
Rappers fallin' off. Careers dead and gone, but
**""I stay on"" (sample)**
So live everyday like it's your last, dog
Cause dog, you never know when it's your time to go
So when the block's long, 'member it's a fast life
Up under street lights, hook flashing flash lights
Sittin' on the porch with a 5th of somethin'
Time to pour it up and make it sweeter than before
Tomorrow, we'll be sold, but still get it on, my nigga cause
**""I stay on"" (sample)**
(Chorus: Danny Brown) x 2
These niggas fallin' off. We got it for the low
Our block stay clickin', nigga. Yours move slow
You lookin' like you hurtin'. You smokin' on them clones, my nigga but
**""I stay on"" (sample)**
(Verse 2: Danny Brown)
I used to work at spots, make thirty off a hunnit'
I was fucked up at the time like ""Run it""
So what, I sold dope. That don't make me who I is
Punked out a couple fights. That don't make me no bitch
Depths of the D. Straight-up out the cage
Danny Brown, motherfucker, out that Bruiser Brigade
Nigga on that no-look thunk shit
These Dunks don't match this fit, so unorthodox with it
If the bitches lookin' at me, cause they know I ain't basic
A blonde bitch could see that, no Lasik
Paint pictures. No need for the tracin'
**""I stay on"" (sample)**
And I be in her walls. One time she almost fainted
Lived in a Slum Village, pussy a little tainted
So I strapped up before I went up in it
I ain't try'na catch nothin', buggin' while I'm up in it

Flow spectacular, flip like a spatula

Laugh during pain, cry during joy
Some shoot veins, others sniff boy

Told me if a nigga test he will do it again
Baby momma shitted on him, started fucking with his friends
Took his son out the D, he won't see him again
Let's go

Mom made me smoke swisher with the incense
Sip a little bit, just to get a little bent
This nigga that he used to front work to
Came up and act like he ain't even know my dude
He feeling better, wanna smoke dude
Told my nigga ""chill and just do what you supposed to""
Get a job like you 'posed to
Running round wild talking like he ain't 'posed to
Said he'd rather be in jail
Most these niggas pussies can't survive in the cell
Biggest downfall, he had a big mouth
Cos niggas hit him up in front of his mom's house
And that's real life drama
Now I feel bad when I look at his momma
Wish I could take it all back
But I wonder what he did to make it end like that

What you do come back, what you do come back
What you do come back, what you do come back

Hot summer day in the motor city
Posted in the hood, all of my niggas with me
Chevy trunk bang so much bass, no lyrics
Celebrate the day my man got turned to a spirit
Gan in the air, Henny in the kidney
Barbecue going, kid's throwing frisbees
Rim in the street, dice game going
Bitches with the short shorts, ass cheeks showing
Balloons in the air, rocking R.I.P. shirts
Baby mom got a tat to prove what he was worth
Sun shining feeling like a holiday
Til niggas pulled up let the whole damn block spray
And that's the end of every function

Opened my eyes like I was surprised

Sleep,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Laying here eyes wide television lights up the room
Like the moon in the nighttime, minds on another daytime
Probably have that same thought until the next sun shine
Watching time while I'm watching infomercials
Nothing else is on so I'm rolling up the purple
Hope it takes me straight to dreams 'cause all I seem to have is nightmares
Waking up in cold sweat punching on the nightstand
Wish i could wake in a puddle of my drool
But when i fall asleep i see myself in a pool of blood
And whats fucked up is if ain't that, the sounds of gunshots are waking me up
Is it paranoia? tell me how? blocks so foul that a nigga getting shot right now
So I roll with the chrone, put 'em where Michael Jackson and say you are not alone
And I can't really call it, when you wanna take a shit and roaches crawling up out your toilet
When you looking out the window, it's snowing in august
If you rolling with the circle always looking like a target
So I'm always DOLO, call me anti-social
Unless it bisexual bitches that's bicoastal
Call me what you want, call me a motherfucker
'cause i do it for the kids here because of broke rubbers
Know its so hard, playing in the D you see nut dripping out of condoms hanging off of monkey bars
Nowhere to go, and outside sounds like the Saving Private Ryan first scene audio
Yeah you hear the sirens, hear the shots echo
Soundtrack the violence when you open up your window
From where you can't blink and all the madness in the street won't let me get a wink

Please just let me sleep
'cause the sounds on the streets won't let me get a peep
So i fall deep, but not falling six feet deep, so underneath the bed sheets where I keep the heat
Streets won't let me chill
Every morning I'm awake, gotta pop another pill
So hard to deal, living with this stress
Pressure won't let me rest

I'm just trying to catch the last letter in the alphabet
And what's outside might get a niggas numbers
Ain't gotta be summer in D, we got heat
Zero below got shit to melt your teeth
Body want to sleep but the mind's not ready yet
Thoughts tortured like a Vietnam vet
All the horror i endured during my adolescent
Got me dependent on these anti-depressant
From the highest rate of crime
Niggas talk murder but they wouldn't kill time
It sound good in your rhyme
'till your sitting in that car in that funeral line
And theres tears in your eyes, wearing all black
Can't do shit, so hard to fight back
'Cause you know your niggas ghosts
And I'mma sleep and still be having dreams about my nigga Louis
Telling me to stay cold, then I await to blood running up out my stuffy nose
And it be so cold, that I be sweating, so much that it always have my braids wet",https://genius.com/Danny-brown-sleep-lyrics

Locked up three years for robbing an autozone
Been out two days and he already heated
I'm chilling on the block with him, chilling getting weeded
He telling me about who he seen on the inside
Then we went to Coney, to get some chili cheese fries
Time passed, we was building 'bout the old days
Talking about the backstabbers robbing up the old jays
After that he ghost, I ain't see him
Heard he got locked robbing a lady in a BM
And just like that he's away from time
So I took time out to put his ass in a rhyme
Because...

We see no evil, hear no evil
All we need now, is to speak no evil
Regardless of what, I'm gonna save my people
It all comes down to who?
See...

Raise the window, swerve through the avenue
Pay homage to the spots I made revenue
Taking me my niggas ain't letting you
And they won't take another one, I'm betting you
God can strike me down if I'm a liar
For my nigga Los, died in a house fire
I ain't forgetting you, bring the whips through
Trapped up niggas, we got work to do
Shit jump off, we address 'em dawg
Got some grown ass niggas knocking at your door
They ain't selling shit, they just spitting clips
Ringing on your doorbell with them hollow tips

Way It Goes,Detroit State of Mind 3,2009,"Look into my eyes, know you see a thug
Cause I dropped out of school to smoke weed and sell drugs
When you listen to me speak, uneducated
Cause I talk with Ebonics and I never graduated
So I'm a lost cause, gun in my drawers
Live another day, seem I got to break the law
Say this another way to put food on my plate
My daughter still hungry at the minimum wage
So you take away my days, put me in a cell
Pray every night, think I should burn in hell?
Lie to me as a kid, say I had a future
But I learned the truth when my mama rent was due
Said you was being honest, gave me a false promise
So I depend on nothing but this bottle and some chronic
Told me that if I change, I might just see dollars
But instead I got change and all it was, was copper

When does it end, God, I don't really know
Might be the state pen' or getting buried in a hole
But that's just the way it go
That's just the way it go
That's just the way it go
That's just the way it go

Even died in a dream
No niggas doing life, some ain't make 18
Young whores in the hood take lies before they start
Robbed of self-esteem, now, they ain't got a heart
Staring in the mirror, hearing voices in my head
Saying: ""Take advantage cause you're 'posed to been dead""
Staying on a mission for the nickels and the dimes
Blowing on chronic while I'm peeking out the blinds
Sign of the time, ain't no respect
Can't leave the house if I ain't got the Tec
At night, I can't sleep, like a Vietnam vet
Can't trust my own blood, everybody is a threat
Paranoid, keep the heater off safety
Roll my own weed, nobody can't lace me

Urns and ashes, black bags and plastic

One Day It Could Happen,Detroit State of Mind,2007,"The oldest of all kids, you can see my ribs
Hunger pains since the days of having stains on my bib
Used the same passion to put the 'caine on the strip
Used the same thirst when I put the bang in the whip
Whoever thought that I would make it with bars?
Used to give fiends ? just to borrow the car
I was just a teenager down on my luck
Thought Jordans and a gold chain was living it up
Only I'd have left mustard stains on my shirt
Kool-Aid and fuego helped clench my thirst
Used to live day-to-day and just wait on the first
Then I lost my first daughter then I seen my work
Had to take steps back, reconstruct my plan
Started rapping up verses, stopped rapping up grams
Flew out to NY, fucking with my mans
Now I'm in the Maybach not the back of the van

My momma used to tell me ""Son, you're gonna make it, one day it'll happen""
Who knew I had what it takes to be famous and one day I'd be rapping
My poppa used to ask me ""Son, are you prepared cos one day it could happen""
I dreamed about this day, but who could've believed that one day I'd be rapping

Back on public transportation
Waking up in the morning with mason
Momma in the kitchen cooking eggs and bacon
Granny gave her last to the preacher man praying
For her grandson to make a change
Constant fiends coming copping with loose change
Was going down the drain, until I hopped on the beat and unleashed my pain
I used to watch wrestling, Hex or Jim ?
Piledrive beats, Dan Brown been thugging
Whole life been broke, I'ma keep on hustling
Tryna stack up a mill, cop a crib for my cousin
But, everywhere you go people wanna hate
Saying that they ? but they plotting on your plate
Taught in the streets, I ain't have to graduate
And nigga, I'ma make it just awaiting my day


People look at my style, momma look at your child
They throw my jams on now, watch the crowd go wild
We done came a long way form copping on broadway
Letting the arms spray, I'd walk in in broad day
Now we entrepreneurs that's concurring tours
The only thing left now to do is sell out stores
But in the hood, I'm platinum, did good with rapping
Money is stacking, done with the slinging and jacking
Now I write and recite what goes on in my life
Remember being too scared to come home at night
Cos I would hate to see you and my father fight
Back then I was a little dude
That rock's skips to school and got ridiculed
Quit the flip and a hit a fool
And I know it's hard, we went through many changes
Tryna raise a son that spoke a different language
But had to change my ways cos I was living dangerous",https://genius.com/Danny-brown-one-day-it-could-happen-lyrics

Your bitch here smoked my trippy stick
Ridiculous, put dick on tit, spit on clit
And it's over with, I'm over it
No sober shit, drink til I just throw up and shit
Y'all ho told me come over here
So guess what nigga it's over with
And it's over with",https://genius.com/Danny-brown-rap-monument-lyrics
Everybody’s Gone,Detroit State of Mind 2 ,UnKnown,"At the church listening to a eulogy
Sitting there feeling like this ain't nothing new to me
Hate funerals but I had to go
Pay respect to my little nigga named Low
Low got hit four times with the 4, about last week (?)
Now I'm in this church with these old dress clothes
Looking at his sister going crazy on the floor
Fighting back tears kind of wish I was with him
Jump in the casket like take me with him
Aunt sung a song made my eyes tear up
Palms got sweaty, nostrils flared up
Had to leave out I was feeling all crazy
Straight to the face had to blow a blunt of hazy
No choice but to hustle
Seems like every year a nigga lose a couple

I look around and (everybody's gone)
I look around and (everybody's gone)
Say your RIP to the dearly departed
Say your RIP to the dearly departed",https://genius.com/Danny-brown-everybodys-gone-lyrics

Danny Brown
Rest in peace J. Dilla

2 AM in the city of the motor
Blowing on some purple I copped form Saratoga
Block hot spot field like Minnesota
Space heater on, ain't getting no warmer
Crack head Yolanda
Knocking at the door
Wanna cop a nick but she only got four
Gave it back to her, said go to the store
Grab me some loosies, red Faygo
Twenty six grams on the broke piece of mirror
What I do with it? Attract the gold diggers
Got me the Cutty with the European clip
Sueded inside the color of cheese grits
26 inches make the hook get nervous
Brown so fly my phone ain't got service
And y'all niggas lame
I'm stunting, more white than X-Games
More green than Celtic games
And I fly the purple in like soul plane
Got the old school in my baby mama name
Off temporary service
Boost mobile chirp but it's never in service
Motherfucker 
Work coming back in the glass pot, Pyrex
Break a thing down one safety pin
Fresh out the county, I ain't ever seen a pit
Locked up in bull pens, I'm a stay eating
Commissary look like I went trick-or-treating",https://genius.com/Danny-brown-mash-freestyle-lyrics
Learn About Me,Detroit State of Mind,2007,"In the VIP at the ceremony of masters
It's the OG Brown, the street broadcaster
Broadcasting live from the city of the motor
The  of record of corner-store reporter
Street law enforcer
Nigga drop dimes get hit with two quarters
And thats a 50 cal nigga
Had your ass smelling like a burnt TV dinner
Niggas study in the streets, learn your lesson
I done did more dirt, sold rocks like Epsom
I done turn more niggas like Salt Lake Edison
Side piped out nigga puffing on medicine
Ride seven mile with about seven thou'
Bout to meet up with Chip$ go out to bail out
Three bitches call them Destiny Child
I'm a grown ass dream birth Destiny Child
I'm OG y'all still need a car seat
The sound of the D I'm Detroit heartbeat
City under lock and key
Y'all niggas ain't street y'all don't want beef

I don't know you but you might know me
And if you don't know nigga, better learn about me
I'm known everywhere, niggas know about me
If you don't know nigga, better learn about me

Danny Brown in the streets like a light pole
Whip same color as the lizard from Geico
Serving D since the days of damaging
South wind Detroit, serving yay to Spanish
Nigga, I'm straight from the block
Done Gator city life, I'm putting rappers in shock
Block hot like Cajun food and most niggas soft like baby food
I see you niggas study and move
But y'all niggas fake, can't do what I do
Nah, nigga it's crunch time
I do it for my niggas locked down with no sunshine
Keep gas in the jar with Swishers rolling up like ten in our car
Think I'm soft, motherfucker come test me
You copping used cars, bout to cop a jet-ski
Puffing toxics, higher than a cockpit
Been getting money since Hancock Rockit
Blaze in my pocket, eyes on the profit
Bout to take over, y'all niggas can't stop it",https://genius.com/Danny-brown-learn-about-me-lyrics

Marching Band,Detroit State of Mind,2007,"Danger, D..Danger, Detroit stand up, danger, uh

Nigga listen, they all some hoes
They ain’t packing and they ain’t even searching at the door
It’s Danny Brown, ya’ll motherfuckers know
Pop your punk ass for acting like the crow
I hear you talking but seeing no action
I’ll make you see words similar to closed caption
Hustle for year, from selling rocks to blows
Ashy Larry niggas fall off on their first roll
No codes and I play no expert
Your songs suck, kill ya’ll with excerpts
I’m so hot like turtle necks with sweatshirts
Bitch on my dick, love the way her neck jerk
Niggas only hard when they get drunk
Rappin' version of the Alvin and the Chipmunks
Keep talking, you must want your shit lumped
If my ass got whooped then I got jumped
Never worry, keep the 4-5th and always in shit like Jersey’s mayor 
Kick it like Freddy Adoo in the womb
Stay in bitches heads like Vidal Sassoon",https://genius.com/Danny-brown-marching-band-lyrics
Waves (Freestyle),UnKnown,2008,"The product of Reaganomics
Teen parents, failing on a promise
Try to stay modest, hard to live?honest
When?it's no dollars?and you talking with ebonics
Far from?a scholar, bad at job interviews
Can't type a resume, dropped out of high school
Tried to go to night school, kept leaving early
Fucking with this thick freak lightskin shorty
Looking for an answer, only get questions
Like I'm in reverse on a busy intersection
Rolling up , close to perfection
Lost in the streets, won't ask for directions
Wanna find corrections, keep doing wrong
Same old song and it don't last long
Tapping out early, submittin' to the streets
But I stay focused, put the words on the beat
But I stay focused, put the words on the beat
I wanna go to heaven, 'cause I'm livin' in hell
My excuse being broke: being in jail
Been broke my whole life and it still ain't fixed
I'ma die tryna get rich
How the fuck you gon' eat, if you can't 
Who the fuck gon' feed us? We can't starve
It ain't good over here
You rollin' up purple but it's wood over here
I lay in bed and think, then I shed a couple tears
Know before noon, I be on my third beer
Go to sleep late but I wake up early
Way I live, dawg, prolly won't see thirty
Wrote my first will when I turned 18
Turnt out ever since I served my first fiend
Hot cup of ramen might last me a day
Broke and ain't ate shit since yesterday",https://genius.com/Danny-brown-waves-freestyle-lyrics
