You Got Me,Things Fall Apart,1999.0,"If you were worried 'bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby, don't worry, you know that you got me
If you were worried 'bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby, don't worry, you know that you got me

Somebody told me that this planet was small
We used to live in the same building, on the same floor
And never met before, until I'm overseas on tour
And peeped this Ethiopian queen from Philly takin' classes abroad
She studyin' film and photo, flash, focus, record
Said she workin' on a flick and could my clique do the score
She said she loved my show in Paris at Élysée Montmartre
And that I stepped off the stage and took a piece of her heart
We knew from the start that things fall apart and tend to shatter
She like, ""That shit don't matter"", when I get home, get at her
Through letter, phone, whatever; let's link, let's get together
Shit, you think not, think the Thought went home and forgot?
Time passed, we back in Philly, now she up in my spot
Tellin' me the things I'm tellin' her is makin' her hot
Started buildin' with her constantly 'round-the-clock
Now she in my world like hip-hop, and keep tellin' me…

If you were worried 'bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby, don't worry, you know that you got me
If you were worried 'bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby, don't worry, you know that you got me

Yo, I'm the type that's always catching a flight
And sometimes I gotta be out at the height of the night
And that's when she flip and get on some old… 
Another lonely night
Seem like I'm on the side, you only lovin' your mic
I know you gotta get that paper, daddy, keep that shit tight
But, yo, I need some sort of love in my life, you dig me?
While politickin' with my sister from New York City
She said she know this ball player and he think I'm pretty—psych
I'm playin', boo, you know it's just with you I'm staying, boo
And when cats be poppin' game, I don't hear what they sayin', boo
When you out there in the world, I'm still your girl
With all my classes, I don't have the time for life's thrills
So when you sweatin' on stage, think of me when you rhyme
And don't be listenin' to your homies, they be leadin' you blind
Yeah, so what you saying, I can trust you?
Is you crazy?! You my king for real
But sometimes relationships get ill, no doubt

If you were worried 'bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby, don't worry, you know that you got me
If you were worried 'bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby, don't worry, you know that you got me

That snake could be that chick and that rat could be that cool cat
That's whisperin', ""She tryin' to play you for the fool, Black""
If something's on your chest, then let it be known
See, I'm not your every five minutes all on the phone
And on the topic of trust, it's just a matter of fact
That people bite back and fracture what's intact
And they'll forever be, I ain't on some ""Oh, I'm a celebrity!""
I deal with the real, so if it's artificial, let it be
I've seen people caught in love like whirlwinds
Listenin' to their squads and listenin' to girlfriends
That's exactly the point where their whole world ends
Lies come in, that's where that drama begins, and she like…

If you were worried 'bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby, don't worry, you know that you got me
If you were worried 'bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby, don't worry, you know that you got me
If you were worried 'bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby, don't worry, you know that you got me
If you were worried 'bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby, don't worry, you know that you got me

The Seed (2.0),Phrenology,2002.0,"Knocked up 9 months ago
And what she finna have? She don't know
She want neo-soul, this hip-hop is old
She don't want no Rock n' Roll
She want platinum or ice and gold
She want a whole lot of something to fold
If you a obstacle, she just drop you cold
Cause one monkey don't stop the show
Little Mary is bad, and these streets she done ran
Ever since when the heat began
I told her ""Girl, look here, calm down, I'mma hold your hand
To enable you to peep the plan, cause you's quick to learn
We can make money to burn if you allow me to lay this game""
I don't ask for much but enough room to spread my wings
And the world finna know my name

I don't ask for much these days
And I don't bitch and whine if I don't get my way
I only want to fertilize another behind my lover's back
I sit and watch it grow roots standing where I'm at
Fertilize another behind my lover's back
And I'm keeping my secrets mine

I push my seed in her bush for life
It's gonna work because I'm pushing it right
If Mary drops my baby girl tonight
I would name her ""Rock n' Roll""

Uh huh, Cadillac need space to roam
Where we heading for? She don't know
We in the city where the pros shake, rattle, and roll
And I'm a gad-dang rolling stone
I don't beg, I can hold my own
I don't break, I can hold the chrome
And it's weighing a ton and I'm a son of a gun
My code name is The Only One
And Black Thought is bad, these streets he done ran
Ever since when the game began
I never played the fool, matter of fact, I been keeping it cool
Since money been changing hands, and I'm left to shine
The legacy that I leave behind be the seed that'll keep the flame
I don't ask for much, but enough room to spread these wings
And the world finna know my name, now listen to me

I don't beg from no rich man
And I don't scream and kick
When his shit don't fall in my hands, man
Cause I know how to steal
Fertilize another against my lover's will
I lick the opposition cause she don't take no pill
Ooh, ooh, ooh no, dear
You'll be keeping my legend alive

I push my seed in her bush for life
It's gonna work because I'm pushing it right
If Mary drop my baby girl tonight
I would name her ""Rock-n-roll""
Oh, break it down, break it down, down for me

I push my seed somewhere deep in her chest
I push it naked cause I've taken my test
Delivering Mary: it don't matter the sex
I'm gonna name it ""Rock-N-Roll""

I push my seed in her bush for life
It's gonna work because I'm pushing it right
If Mary drop my baby girl tonight
I would name her ""Rock-n-roll""
I would name her ""Rock-n-roll""
I would name her ""Rock-n-roll"", yeah
I would name it ""Rock-n-roll""",https://genius.com/The-roots-the-seed-20-lyrics
Make My,undun,2011.0,"I did it all for the money, Lord,
 it's what it seems
Well in the world of night terrors, it's, hard to dream
They hollerin' ""Cash rules everything"", just call it C.R.E.A.M
Cause when it rises to the top, you get, the finer things
Ocean fronts, rolling blunts, with model chicks
And saying grace over lobster and steak
Like please forgive us for riding Benzes with camera plates
Too busy looking backwards for jackers to pump my brakes
For help signs to symbolize the lives that hunger takes
Addicted to the green; if I don't ball, I'll get the shakes
I'd give it all for a peace of mind, for Heaven's sakes
My heart's so heavy that the ropes that hold my casket breaks
Cause everything that wasn't for me, I had to chase
I had to take, I had to take

They told me that the ends
Won't justify the means
And they told me at the end
It won't justify the dreams
That I've had since a child
Maybe I'll throw in the towel
Make my (make my), make my (make my)
Departure from the world

Tryin' to control the fits of panic
Unwritten and unraveled, it's the dead man's pedantic
Whatever, see it's really just a matter of semantics
When everybody's fresh out of collateral to damage
And my splaying got me praying like a mantis
I begin to vanish, feel the pull of the blank canvas
I'm contemplating that special dedication
To whoever it concern, my letter of resignation
Fading back to black, my dark coronation
The heat of the day, the long robe of muerte
That soul is in the atmosphere like airplay
If there's a Heaven, I can't find the stairway

They told me that the ends
Won't justify the means
And they told me at the end
It won't justify the dreams
That I've had since a child
Maybe I'll throw in the towel
Make my (make my), make my (make my)
Departure from the world",https://genius.com/The-roots-make-my-lyrics
The OtherSide,undun,2011.0,"Yo, we obviously need to tone it down a bit
Running 'round town spending time like it’s counterfeit
Everybody catching hay fever like sinuses
Step in my arena, let me show y’all who the highness is
You might say I could be doing something positive
Humble head down, low and broke like promises
Soaking and broken in a joke like comics is
Not enough paper to be paying folks compliments
But when that paper got low, so did my tolerance
And it ain’t no truth in a dare without the consequence
Listen, if it not for these hood inventions
I'd just be another kid from the block with no intentions
On the dock of that bay, serving a life sentence
Even if I’m going to hell, I’m gonna make an entrance
Yeah, let 'em know I’m getting cheese like omeletes is
But I’m the toast of the town like Thomas is

We’re all on a journey
Down the hall of memories
Don’t worry 'bout what you ain’t got
Leave with a little bit of dignity
Never loved what I had
Always felt like I deserved more
But when I make it to the other side (Make it to the other side)
That’s when we’ll settle up the score

Yo, we did this in remembrance of
Faces from the past we no longer have an image of
Carrying coldblooded hearts that never been for love
Brothers keep going for theirs, but never get enough
World travelers that seen it all and did enough
Only to return to learn the world wasn’t big enough
Damn, how long has it been? I guess the jig is up
Now all I know is I’m about to wake this nigga up
Yeah, that hindsight 20/20
Now niggas dead on the money, tryna take something from me
It’s a wrap like a mummy, undun, I am becoming
And when he’s tired of running through the layers of the onion
He’ll probably shed a tear cause they’ll be no more fast times
Just his weak mind scrolled out like a bad sign
He never had enough and got confused when they asked why
Life is only a moment in time and it passed by

We’re all on a journey
Down the hall of memories
Don’t worry bout what you ain’t got
Leave with a little bit of dignity
Never loved what I had
Always felt like I deserved more
But when I make it to the other side (Make it to the other side)
That’s when we’ll settle up the score

I’m sitting on top of the world ready to jump off
Thinking of various ways to break a gun law
Thinking that enough is enough but still I want more
Thinking how I’m playing with fire that burned my young bol
By any means necessary, don’t give a damn
So every night I’m on a flight that never lands
Be an asshole when the shit hits the fan
Or bet your life on a bluff and a bad hand
Can’t win, can’t lose, get 'em gassed, leave 'em leaking fuel
Either way the market moves
Cash rules kings, queens, prince and princess
Every night I’m crossing a line that ain’t the finish
Every thought is dark as a glass of fucking Guinness
Too far gone to come back to my senses
Now I’m on the edge of my bed making love to my meds
Every moment's like a pistol to my head when I’m getting mine

We’re all on a journey
Down the hall of memories
Don’t worry bout what you ain’t got
Leave with a little bit of dignity
Never loved what I had
Always felt like I deserved more
But when I make it to the other side (Make it to the other side)
That’s when we’ll settle up the score

Score, score, score, score, score
Score, score, score, score
Score, score, score, score
Score, score, score...",https://genius.com/The-roots-the-otherside-lyrics
Sleep,undun,2011.0,"Like when autumn leaves
Fall down from the trees
There goes my honeybee

I’ve lost a lot of sleep to dreams
And I do not miss them yet
I wouldn’t wish them on the worst of enemies
Let them burn, go from here
Like when autumn leaves

To catch a thief, who stole the soul I prayed to keep
Insomniac, bad dreams got me losing sleep
I’m dead tired, my mind playing tricks, deceit
A face in the glass, unable to admit defeat
All that I am, all that I was is history
The past unraveled, adding insult to this injury
I’m fighting the battle for the soul of the century
Destiny is everything that I pretend to be
Look, and what I did came back to me eventually
The music played on, and told me I was meant to be awake
It’s unresolved like everything I had at stake
Illegal activity controls my black symphony
Orchestrated like it happened incidentally
Oh, there I go, from a man to a memory
Damn, I wonder if my fam will remember me

I’ve lost a lot of sleep to dreams
And I do not miss them yet
I wouldn’t wish them on the worst of enemies
Let them burn, go from here
Like when autumn leaves",https://genius.com/The-roots-sleep-lyrics
The Fire,How I Got Over,2010.0,"Ohhhh
The fire, the fire
Ohhhh
The fire, the fire

There's something in your heart
And it's in your eyes
It's the fire, inside you
Let it burn
You don't say, ""Good luck""
You say, ""Don't give up""
It's the fire, inside you
Let it burn

Yeah, and if I'm ever at the crossroads
And start feeling mixed signals like Morse code
My soul start to grow colder than the North Pole
I try to focus on the hole of where the torch goes
And in tradition of these legendary sports pros
As far as I can see, I've made it to the threshold
Lord knows I've waited for this a lifetime
And I'm an icon when I let my light shine
Shine bright as an example of a champion
Taking the advantage, never copping out or cancelling
Burn like a chariot, learn how to carry it
Maverick, always above and beyond average
Fuel to the flame that I train with and travel with
Something in my eyes say I'm so close to having the prize
I realized I'm supposed to reach for the skies
Never let somebody try to tell you otherwise

There's something in your heart
And it's in your eyes
It's the fire, inside you
Let it burn
You don't say, ""Good luck""
You say, ""Don't give up""
It's the fire, inside you
Let it burn

One love, one game, one desire
One flame, one bonfire, let it burn higher
I never show signs of fatigue or turn tired
Cause I'm the definition of tragedy turned triumph
It's David and Goliath, I made it to the eye of the storm
Feeling torn like they fed me to the lions
Before my time start to wind down like the Mayans
I show 'em how I got the grind down like a science
It sounds like a riot on hush, it's so quiet
The only thing I hear is my heart, I'm inspired
By the challenge that I find myself standing eye to eye with
Then move like a wise warrior and not a coward
You can't escape the history that you was meant to make
That's why the highest victory is what I'm meant to take
You came to celebrate, I came to cerebrate
I hate losing, I refuse to make the same mistake

Ohhhh
The fire, the fire
Ohhhh
The fire, the fire

There's something in your heart
And it's in your eyes
It's the fire, inside you
Let it burn
You don't say, ""Good luck""
You say, ""Don't give up""
It's the fire, inside you
Let it burn

Ohhhh
The fire, inside you

The fire, inside you",https://genius.com/The-roots-the-fire-lyrics
One Time,undun,2011.0,"Yo, the spirit in the sky scream, ""Homicide!""
But it was time to ride on some niggas funny talking
If too much money talking, we make 'em economize
Real rap, no tale spinning, such is the life of a kamika-
Ze pilot, we wylin' out of control
Until we all make the funny papers like Comic-Con
Feared in all streets, so if you ever see me out in y’all streets
Find another one to occupy
I never hope for the best, I wish a nigga would
Turn around and walk away, I wish a nigga could
Listen to my instincts and say, ""Fuck the rest""
But once you’ve had the best better ain’t as good
Weak-heartedness cannot be involved
Stick to the script, nigga, fuck your improv
Like a samurai, the street’s Hammurabi Code
Play your part, shut the fuck up and do as I was told

I was always late for the bus
Just once can I be on time?
Then I start to think, what’s the rush?
Who wants to be on time?
Feeling unlucky
And if I ever got lucky, it was one time
In this crazy world

Not a thing I fear besides fear itself
This is clearly a lesson learned for someone else
Reach for the crown of thorns upon the shelf
Cross around my neck, I’ve been taught by stealth
Capture this moment in time, it’s a smash and grab
And where my party people? Y’all finna have a blast
You say goodbye, I say hello first and last
Hello hello, now all of y’all elevate your glass
To an example of what time will do to you
When those nameless things just keep on eluding you
When shit is new to you and lies is true to you
Words of suspects-usual coming though to you
Man, I guess if I was ever lucky it was one time
Then I went missing, looking for the sublime
A nigga stayed low, left the ladder unclimbed
Time after time, verse blank, the line unrhymed

You ever wonder what’s the big fuss
For everyone be on time?
What’s the big deal? Why do they feel?
The need to have us marching on line
Feeling unlucky
And if I’d ever got lucky, it was one time
In this crazy world

I wonder when you die, do you hear harps and bagpipes?
If you born on the other side of the crack pipe
Niggas learn math just to understand the crack price
Then dive in head first like a jackknife
Cause out here, yo, you niggas can’t belly flop
If you wanna make the noise inside your belly stop
One time means being on the front line
Being on the front line means ducking one time
The pendulum swinging my way couldn’t be more blind
Niggas talk to the cops? Not even one time
Cause we all going down just like the subprime
Or a cheap ass half gallon of Ballantine
But hopping over gates to escape is sublime
Been through the alley way and down to the sub line
Tales from the streets, a life of high crime
To make it to the bottom, such a high climb

I was always late for the bus
Just once can I be on time?
Then I start to think, what’s the rush?
Who wants to be on time?
Feeling unlucky
And if I ever got lucky, it was one time
In this crazy world",https://genius.com/The-roots-one-time-lyrics
What They Do,Illadelph Halflife,1996.0,"Never do what they do, what they do, what they do
Never do what they do, what they do, what they do

Yo, yo
Lost generation, fast-paced nation
World population confront they frustration
The principles of true hip-hop have been forsaken
It's all contractual and about money-making
Pretend-to-be cats don't seem to know they limitation
Exact replication and false representation
You wanna be a man? Then stand your own
To emcee requires skills, I demand some shown
I let the frauds keep fronting and roam like a cellular phone
Far from home, giving crowds what they wanting
Official hip-hop consumption, 
The Fifth thumpin'
Keeping your party jumping with an original something
Yo, I dedicate this to the one-dimensional
No imagination, excuse for perpetration
My man came over and said, ""Yo, we thought we heard you""
Joke's on you; you heard a biting-ass crew, but, um

Never do what they do, what they do, what they do
Never do what they do, what they do, what they do

Thin is the line that run between love and hatred
The game is ill-natured, it's nothing sacred
Aiyyo, it's funny what I see some rap niggas do to make it
A few'll blow up, or go as far as they can take it
My nine-to-five is just to hit ya, get the party live
I'm Black Thought, used to rap for sport
Now the rhyme saying, rent paying life support
I take it very seriously within this industry
It's various crews that try to touch me
But I come with the beautiful things, and I bless the track plushly
Around the world crowds love me from doing tours
Recipient of applause from all of you and yours
Creator of original sounds that's in the stores
You take home to absorb and sweat it out your pores
Now, who can stop the music running through these veins?
Infinitely go against the grain, that's why my motto's to

Never do what they do, what they do, what they do
Never do what they do, what they do, what they do

Living the life of limos and lights
Airplanes and trains, short days and long nights
Keyboards and mics, bass chords and drum kicks
And my mental thick, they hit my head like brick
As I embark on a mission, welcoming to the dark
When I first spark the art's when the listening start
Open your head wide, and let the Thought inside
My style fortified by all of Philadelph-i
My delph more stealth than all the wicked wealth-y
Mentality undetectable by the naked eye
Then I get paid when the record is played
To put it short 
""I want it made"" like Ed
, 'nuff said
Then after that, I'm putting on my cousin Hamed
We let the ladies blend with the dark-skinned thoroughbred
And discover, my level is that of no other
And Roots crew reign official and true while I'm continuing to

Never do what they do, what they do, what they do
Never do what they do, what they do, what they do
Never do what they do, what they do, what they do
Never do what they do, what they do, what they do
Never do what they do, what they do, what they do
Never do what they do, what they do, what they do",https://genius.com/The-roots-what-they-do-lyrics

Come get your kool on
Stars are made to shine, stars are made to shine

I’m in the double G, three-piece tux
Screaming dressed to kill, hope somebody call my bluff
It’s a full house, sipping on a royal flush
Two queens is on my cuffs, good times is in the cards
Living on borrowed time, I’m paying the extra charge
To feel like something small is worth a hundred large
Swag is on retard, charm is on massage
Wit is on guard, I challenge you to a duel
Who needs a chain when every thought's a jewel?
God bless the weirdo when everyone’s a fool
Fuck a genie and three wishes
I just want a bottle, a place to write my novel
I am heroin to those that hear a rhyme and think:
""How do you find this upper echelon this time?""
Let’s toast to better days
A beautiful mind and a flow that never age

Say my reputation precede me like a pedigree
Gentlemanly gangsta steez, beyond the seventies
Holdin' fast money without running out of patience
Move in silence without running up in places
Cake by the layers, rich but never famous
Hustle anonymous, still remain nameless
In hindsight, gold come in bars like a Klondike
The minute before the storm hit is what I’m calm like
Suited and booted for a shooting like it’s prom night
It’s suicide, right? Pursuers tried like
To no avail and a hero's what they died like
I’ve got 'em waiting on the news like I’m Cronkite
Not in the limelight or needed for crime, right
No boasts, just bodied and chalked close to the line-sight

Come get your kool on
Stars are made to shine
Come get your kool on
Stars are made to shine
Come get your kool on
Stars are made to shine
Come get your kool on
Stars are made to shine, stars are made to shine

Yeah, outside where the killers and the dealers swarm
And inside, they dressed up like it’s a telethon
Black tie affair but they holding heavy arms
Straight cash with a stash in the cummerbund
More Bacardi and the Bastards of the Party home
Riots erupting around and still we party on
Been a quantum leap to a king from a pawn
But it was destined, the conclusion was foregone
Serenade of the former slave promenade
Cause them long days in the sun have now become shade
So we doing high speeds in the narrow lane
Say cheese, free falling from the aeroplane
Another feather in the cap, for all the years
That we spent in luxury's lap without looking back
Cause memories could sting like a hornet
Damn, it felt good to see people up on it

Come get your kool on

Come get your kool on

Don’t Say Nuthin’,The Tipping Point,2004.0,"Yeah! That all mighty amazing, ill, highly contagious
Kamikaze south splash like it shot from a gauge
Until your body sound clash
Head of the Class, Magna Cum Laude
Beats bring the beast out me, flagrant foul rowdy
Reed pipe but deep tight, disposition keep on flipping
Keep em playing they position
Keep making the people listen what I spin
Put em out on a limb
Got tears, got blood, got sweat, leaking out of the pen
Y'all fake niggas not setting a trend
We never listen to them
It's like trying to take a piss in the wind
My home team doing visitors in, yo don't test em
They all standing close to the edge, so don't stress em
Now who the type built to last?
It's no question, the Master!
Villain in Black with no Stetson, my sound
Hitting you hard from every direction
Your head and shoulder, area your midsection dawg!

When the saint on the ground with his nine on line
With the niggers who grind with King Kong hittin' Thailand
Give it here and don’t say nuthin'
Just give it here, give it here and don’t say nuthin'
When the team on the set with the guns gone clap
Gettin' down on everything, hmmm, cut the check
Give it here, and don't say nuthin
Just give it here, give it here and don't say nuthin

Yeah, Illadel! Home of the original gun clappers
Out on the wrong corner your shit'll get spun backwards
You got the fool wanting the rules, enter at risk
Or your own nana'll keep a gat under the mattress
Shorties running reckless from Philly to Texas
Surprising what niggas willing to do to get a necklace
Some emotions felt better left unexpressed at times
Niggas' crime record longer than a guest list
Yes, I done seen things you wouldn't believe
Seen people reach levels thought they'd never achieve
Silhouettes waiting in the wings ready to D
Thirsty sheists who need at least a buck to breathe
C'mon! Stick up kids, they be out to tax
Most times they be sticking you without the gats
I'll still be on the grind when it all collapse
And if it’s mine, word is bond, I'mma take it right back nigga

When the saint on the ground with his nine on line
With the niggers who grind with King Kong hittin' Thailand
Give it here and don’t say nuthin'
Just give it here, give it here and don’t say nuthin'
When the team on the set with the guns gone clap
Gettin' down on everything, hmmm, cut the check
Give it here, and don't say nuthin
Just give it here, give it here and don't say nuthin

Yeah, it ain't nothin like I rush I get, in front of the band
On stage wit the planet in the palm of my hand
When a brother transform, from anonymous man
To the force, crush whoever might of thought I was playin
I'mma flame some sinister shit, the code twister
Slang thicker than Big Boi’s baby momma’s sister
Pain beyond measure, relaxed under pressure
You see the master piece, but to me it's unperfected
Give it here Geffen Records
, I'm off the handle
Cut the check, and yo it better be as heavy as anvil
Next joint comin, all bets is canceled
Nigga Black Ink, 
Grand Wizzard

We finna have the whole industry at a stand still
See me put the system on lock like Camp Hill
So get wit them endorsements, and call reinforcements
Cause my click come a full sizable portion

When the saint on the ground with his nine on line
With the niggers who grind with King Kong hittin' Thailand
Give it here and don’t say nuthin'
Just give it here, give it here and don’t say nuthin'
When the team on the set with the guns gone clap
Gettin' down on everything, hmmm, cut the check
Give it here, and don't say nuthin
Just give it here, give it here and don't say nuthin",https://genius.com/The-roots-dont-say-nuthin-lyrics
When The People Cheer,…and then you shoot your cousin,2014.0,"Lights, camera, chemical reaction
Attracted to a body of lies with fat asses
Thank the Most High for the high of high fashion
My art of war is killer couture, denim assassin

Am I, am I a douchebag or just another du-rag
Tryin' get ahead on some brand new wave shit?
For your entertainment, money is the language
So every time I speak, I’m tryna make another payment
I do ‘em dirty, sleep and get a dirt nap
That works, 'til my P.O. ask me where I work at
Think I would learned that sleeping in the bird trap
Living on the run like somebody tryin' burn fat
I don’t give a fuck, now maybe that’s abstinence
Or the arrogance of someone who ain’t got shit
That think money over bitches is a stock tip (Tip, tip, tip, tip)

I live in a trap where things go crack
Wake up in the box with a box of Apple Jacks
Everybody acts like God is all that
But I got the feelin' he ain’t never coming back
So I got an angel that answer my prayer
Floating on the cloud that I blow in the air
Nobody wins, but nobody cares
They just want blood when the people cheer

I’m down to 95 dollars, that’s the extent of my riches
Out of 99 problems, 98 of ‘em is bitches
Out here hollerin', what’s ironic is I’ve honestly been tryna do what’s right
But some jawn legs in the air tonight like Phil Collins
I’m a sex-addicted introvert, 
sucker for a pencil skirt
Looking for a shorty coming from work, that I can pervert
On my existential grind doing consequential dirt
Searchin’ for physical pleasure if I don’t go mental first
Molly poppin’
, 
trolley hoppin’
, 
know somebody prolly watchin’
That ain’t stoppin’ me from coppin’ a feel
, 
karate choppin’
In this after-hours spot, watching mommy body rockin’
First I feed her vodka shots
 
then she eat my Johnnie Cochran
Livin’ fast, drinkin' Capt'
, one of them hoes even had
The audacity ask me how long this thing would last
I said, ""You wanna pay for class? Get on that stage and shake your ass""
She keep a dick in a box in an emergency, break the glass
I make her laugh, 
she makes it clap
And then she gives me lap dances and I’m thankful that
She keeps providing the place for me to be unfaithful at
(Be unfaithful at, be unfaithful at, be unfaithful at)

I live in a trap where things go crack
Wake up in the box with a box of Apple Jacks
Everybody acts like God is all that
But I got the feelin' he ain’t never coming back
So I got an angel that answer my prayer
Floating on the cloud that I blow in the air
Nobody wins, but nobody cares
They just want blood when the people cheer",https://genius.com/The-roots-when-the-people-cheer-lyrics
Lighthouse,undun,2011.0,"If you can‘t swizzim then ya bound to drizzown
Passing out life jackets, 'bout to go didown
Get down with the captain or go down with the ship
Before the dark abyss, I’ma hit you with this
Now if you can‘t swizzim then ya bound to drizzown
Passing out life jackets, 'bout to go didown
Get down with the captain or go down with the ship
Before the dark abyss, I’ma hit you with this

And no one’s in the lighthouse
You’re face down in the ocean
And no one’s in the lighthouse
And it seems like you just screamed
It’s no one there to hear the sound
And it may feel like there’s no one there
That cares if you drown
Face down in the ocean

Smoking cheap weed, sipping on cheap vodka
You pick your poison down Davy Jones’ locker
It’s rum we be wanting, by the tons my consumption
Take a look at my lungs and my liver, it’s disgusting
Take a look at the man in the mirror, we start fussing
Only one person gets hurt when throwing punches
Me, and the man behind the glass just laughs
The waves come over my head and just crash
My hand start bleeding water starts receeding
A feeling comes into my heart, I start believing
That I actually might survive through the evening
Survive on my own thoughts of suicide that’s competing
With thoughts of tryna stay alive which been weakened
By the feeling of putting on a smile while being beaten
The fear of drowning, still diving in the deep end
The waters carried me so far you can’t reach 'em
And it feels like there’s no one

And no one’s in the lighthouse
You’re face down in the ocean
And no one’s in the lighthouse
And it seems like you just screamed
It’s no one there to hear the sound
And it may feel like there’s no one there
That cares if you drown
Face down in the ocean

After the love is lost
Friendship dissolves, and even blood is lost
Where did it begin? The way we did each other wrong
Troubled water neither one of us could swim across
I stopped holding my breath, now am I better off
There without a trace and you in my head and all?
The halted motion of a rebel without a pause
What it do is done, 'til you are dead and gone
The grim reaper telling me to swim deeper
Where the people go to, lo and behold, the soul keeper
I’m not even breaking out in a sweat, or cold fever
But I’m never paying up on my debt, or tolls either
I’ll leave the memories here, I won’t need them
If I stop thinking and lie, now that’s freedom
Your body’s part of the Maritime museum
And face down in the past is where I’m being

And no one’s in the lighthouse
You’re face down in the ocean
And no one’s in the lighthouse
And it seems like you just screamed
It’s no one there to hear the sound
And it may feel like there’s no one there
That cares if you drown
You're face down in the ocean

If you can‘t swizzim then ya bound to drizzown
Passing out life jackets, 'bout to go didown
Get down with the captain or go down with the ship
Before the dark abyss I’ma hit you with this
Now if you can‘t swizzim then ya bound to drizzown
Passing out life jackets, 'bout to go didown

I Remember,undun,2011.0,"I drew a 2 of hearts from a deck of cards
A stock trick from my empty repertoire
Another hopeless story never read at all
I’m better off looking for the end where the credits are
It’s a pain living life against the grain
I’m looking back and y’all look the same
Troy, Mark, and little what’s-his-name
, 
memory is rerunning it all
It’s the flight of my fall
, 
and it’s right on the wall

I remember
Can you remember
How it was? I do
Remember, do you?
I remember
Can you remember
How it was? I do
Remember, do you?

I used to ride the train to the same two stops
And look at the graffiti on the rooftops
Like the same song playing on the jukebox
Joint called ""Faded Polaroids In A Shoebox""
Regardless to what the cadence is
It can’t be forgotten like old acquaintances
I realize how depressing of a place it is
And when I notice my reflection whose face it is

I remember
Can you remember
How it was? I do
Remember, do you?
I remember
Can you remember
How it was? I do
Remember, do you?


I remember
Can you remember
How it was? I do
Remember, do you?
I remember
Can you remember
How it was? I do
Remember, do you?

It’s only human to express the way you really feel
But that same humanity is my Achilles’ heel
A leopard can’t change its spots and never will
So I’m forever ill
, now I can never chill
What’s keeping me from breaking out like Benadryl
When my baptism of fire resulted in a kill
Sometimes it’s as cut and dry as a business deal
You gotta cause the blood of a close friend to spill
But you remember still",https://genius.com/The-roots-i-remember-lyrics
Now or Never,How I Got Over,2010.0,"Everything's changing around me
And I want to change too
It's one thing I know
It ain't cool being no fool
I feel different today
I don't know what else to say
But I'ma get my shit together
It's now or never
(Now or never, now or never)
(Now or never, now or never)

Uhh, I'm sick, sick of waiting in vain, tired of playing the game
Thinking of making a change, finally breaking the chains
Every phase, every happening craze
When it's said and done, my head is right back in a haze
I'm ready for the next chapter and page to start acting my age
And part ways with Black Thought from back in the days
I'm stargazing from the back of the stage
Questioning if who y'all praise is worthy of praise
What's the phrase ""bygones is bygones?""
Niggas who used to be the underdogs is icons
People say the light shines once in a lifetime
Is this midlife kind a crisis a little bit like mine?
I'm thinking not now but right now
I need some kinda sign that the future is bright now
I fuck around, do the right thing like Spike now
The quick and the dead, which one is my lookalike now?
I'm moving ahead

Everything's changing around me
And I want to change too
It's one thing I know
It ain't cool being no fool
I feel different today
I don't know what else to say
But I'ma get my shit together
It's now or never
(Now or never, now or never)
(Now or never, now or never)

Yo, opportunities lost because I blew them
On the sunniest days of my life, I cried through them
Mom was out the picture, and pops, I barely knew him
And I would pray to God but I'm tired of lying to him
Tired of tryna run from the things inside of us
Got a lot of fam and a lot of admirers
Who tell me that I should aspire to be changed
But when I think of changing, it's like, 'Why even try this shit?'
My mind hazy and my thoughts, they get distorted
I know my good and bad deeds both get recorded
You do right so your soul can last
But my role is cast before I even audition for it
So I don't really see an end to my vice
It's just false reformation, no end of my strife
Feel the evil overpowering, you can go ahead, throw the towel in
Cause nigga, that's the end of the fight
When you can only see the tunnel at the end of the light
Lights out, party over, it's the end of your life
And I'm out

Everything's changing around me
And I want to change too
It's one thing I know
It ain't cool being no fool
I feel different today
I don't know what else to say
But I'ma get my shit together
It's now or never
(Now or never, now or never)
(Now or never, now or never)

When I look into the mirror and see my own image
It feel like there's something else far in the distance
Something I wanna see, but something that's resistant
And every day, the haunting is growing more persistent
I never noticed it before, but now I can't miss it
And the constant pounding's driving me ballistic
I ran from it for years, but it's still next to me
And it's growing stronger, taking even less of me
I can't fight it now, I know it's just destiny
And I just wonder what's gon' happen when it catches me
Will it leave me face down in the Chesapeake?
Or will it just start bringing out the best in me?
But is the best in me really just the worst in me?
And if so, yesterday could be my anniversary
In sinner's court, sip port and have church with me
I'm trying to get rid of these ghosts that's cursing me
I'm feeling change is an absolute certainty
Cause what's going on is a state of emergency

Everything's changing around me
And I want to change too
It's one thing I know
It ain't cool being no fool
I feel different today
I don't know what else to say
But I'ma get my shit together
It's now or never
It's now or never",https://genius.com/The-roots-now-or-never-lyrics
How I Got Over,How I Got Over,2009.0,"Ugh, uh-huh
Ugh, uh-huh

Out on the streets (Yeah)

That type of thinking can't get you nowhere (Ugh, oh)
Someone has to care (Uh)
How I got over

Where the people come apart
Don't nobody care about you, only thing you got is God
Out here in these streets, if you get down on your luck
You can stand out with a hand out, but nobody give a fuck
Out here in these streets, every man is for himself
They ain't helping no one else, it's a hazard to your health
Living life in these cold streets
Hey—who's worrying 'bout you, babe?
When you wilding out? Running around in these streets?

Out on the streets, where I grew up
How I got over
First thing they teach you is not to give a fuck
How I got o
That type of thinking can't get you nowhere
How I got over
Someone has to care (Yo)

When you on the corner, there's too much drama
Living with the police right behind you
It's always more than a slight reminder
We living in a war zone like Rwanda
Before I go back to the Heavenly Father
Pray for me, if it ain't too much bother
Whatever don't break me'll make me stronger
I feel like I can't take too much longer
It's too much lying and too much frying
I'm all cried out 'cause I grew up crying
They all got a sales pitch; I ain't buying
They trying to convince me that I ain't trying
We uninspired, we unadmired
And tired and sick of being sick and tired
Of living in the hood where the shots are fired
We dying to live; so, to live, we dying
You just like I am

Out on the streets (Ugh), where I grew up
How I got over
First thing they teach you is not to give a fuck
How I got over
That type of thinking can't get you nowhere
Yo, somebody, somewhere
Someone has to care
Man, somebody's gotta care

And I swear it isn't fair
In suspended animation, we ain't tryna go nowhere
Out here in these streets, we're so young and all alone
We ain't even old enough to realize we're on our own
Living life in these hard streets, where it's like they lost they mind
Is there anyway to find? Are we running out of time out here?
Listen...
Hey—who's worrying 'bout you, babe?
When you wilding out?
Running around in these streets?

Stomp,undun,2011.0,"It’s about flesh and blood
It’s about a heart beat that beats strong
It’s about a passion that is unyielding
And I want you men to know today
It is your time, it is your hour, it is your moment
Go take it!

Yeah, speaking of pieces of a man
Staring at a future in the creases of my hand
It reads like a final letter, I’m leaving for my fam
But it’s written in language they will never understand
A late repentant, never deviating from a plan
I drive by headed for the valley of the damned
The wheels spin, I’m looking for a sacrificial lamb
Then roll tactics like a soldier out in the Sudan
Listen, was this a matter of flesh and blood? Yes it was
Does it matter who win and lose? Yes it does
It ain’t about the most blessed love
When you return to the essence, what is it back to the essence of?
Greatness I wasn't in the presence of
Cause you was fake and never measured up
You just a nigga on his regular, but how far am I ahead of ya?
It just as easily coulda been me instead of ya

We gon' fight 'til we can’t fight no more
And when we can’t fight no more
We gon' lie down and bleed a while
We gon’ get up, and fight some more
And I want you say it with me
Repeat it after me when I say it
We gon’ fight!

Fuck getting fucked, immaculate conception
Now ""what’s beef?"" ain’t even a question
Calico kisses, cold blood and crime tape
Flirt with death, every night it’s a blind date
One night stand, payback's a bitch
Shit have you skinny dipping in a pool of your piss
Blood, sweat and tears, broken teeth and spit
Put the barrel in your mouth, blow the devil a kiss
Put the knife in ya back, cut down to the red meat
Daddy should’ve let me be a stain on the bed sheets
I’m one shot short of a Molotov cocktail
Kick in the door like welcome to my world
I’m an evil genius when it comes to this dumb shit
Half of the time I'ma keep it one hundred
Don’t play chicken when I’m driving them crazy
Get hit in the wing, thigh, breast or drumstick

Yo, I’m always early, I never take off
Cause I got a job, rob Peter to pay Paul
Now I realize it’s the winner that takes all
Do what I gotta do because I can’t take loss
Picture me living life as if I’m some animal
That consumes its own dreams like I’m a cannibal
I won’t accept failure unless it’s mechanical
But still the alcohol mixed with the botanical
I guess I be referred to the owners manual full of loners
Full of all the homeless throwaways and the stoners
Soldiers of the streets with 8th grade diplomas
And the world awaiting their shoulders as a bonus
Look, let he without sin live without sin
Until then, I’ll be doing dirty jobs like swamp men
Counting the faces of those that I might have been
It’s like living that life, but I won’t live that life again

Lot of niggas go to prison, how many come out Malcolm X?
I know I'm not, shit, can't even talk about the rest
Famous last words: ""You under arrest""
Will I get popped tonight? It's anybody's guess
I guess, a nigga need to stay cunning
I guess when the cops coming, need to start running
I won't make the same mistakes from my last run-in
You either done doing crime now or you done in
I got a brother on the run, and one in
Wrote me a letter, he said, ""When you coming?""
Shit man, I thought the goal's to stay out
Back against the wall, then shoot your way out
Getting money's a style that never plays out
'til you in a box and your stash money’s paid out
The scales of justice ain't equally weighed out
Only two ways out, digging tunnels or digging graves out

Dear God, I see your face in all I do
Sometimes, it's so hard to believe in
But God, I know you have your reasons

Uh-huh, they said he's busy, hold the line please
Call me crazy, I thought maybe he could mind read
Who does the blind lead?
 
Show me a sign please
If everything is made in China, are we Chinese?
And why do haters separate us like we siamese?
Technology turning the planet into zombies
Everybody all in everybody's dirty laundry
Acid rain, earthquakes, hurricane, tsunamis
Terrorists, crime sprees, assaults and robberies
Cops yelling ""Stop freeze,"" shoot him 'fore he try to leave
Air quality so foul, I gotta try to breathe
Endangered species and we running out of trees
If I could hold the world in the palm of these hands
I would probably do away with these anomalies
Everybody checking for the new award nominees
Wars and atrocities, look at all the poverty
Ignoring the prophecies, 
more beef than broccoli
Corporate monopoly, weak world economy
Stock market toppling, mad marijuana
OxyContin and Klonopin, everybody out of it

Well I've been thinking about
And I've been breaking it down
Without an answer
I know I'm thinking out loud
But if your love's still around
Why do we suffer? Why do we suffer?

Uh-huh, yeah, it's still me, one of your biggest fans
I get off work, right back to work again
I probably need to go ahead and have my head exam
Look how they got me on the Def Jam payment plan
Well, I'm in the world of entertainment and
Tryna keep a singing man sane for the paying fans
If I don't make it through the night, slight change of plans
Harp strings, angel wings and praying hands
Lord, forgive me for my shortcomings
For going on tour and ignoring the court summons
All I'm tryna do is live life to the fullest
They sent my daddy to you in a barrage of bullets
Why is the world ugly when you made it in your image?
And why is living life such a fight to the finish?
For this high percentage, when the sky's the limit
A second is a minute, every hour's infinite

Knowing when we get it off, Girl I mean it all
Keeping you fiending 'til you taking it tossed

Is it because he's superficial
Or is he too submissive
Or did I come along and hit you with the futuristic
Or is it cause you really couldn't see a future with him
All he about is paper, never took the time with you to listen
You want it gripped up, flipped, and thrown
And get stripped and shown, the way to get in the zone

That come through in a mix for you with no head tricks or fraud
You need a new position, somethin' to get you open like its Eucalyptus got you ready to go for your's
Come on and work wit' meh', you won't get hurt wit' meh': Just keep it real and you'll get broken off certainleh' (certainly)

Well it's like, smack the track up and leave dents in it

All fly girls' nipples and toes numb from it
MC's in my circumference, is confronted son
Get your growth stunted from this, you don't want it

Who the ultimate? Yo my man speak upon it
Ayo, I stop fools and drop jewels but never run it
Rock mics so nice, I make you stock price plummet
All you high noon riders better rally at the summit
It's me and Tariq and your fleet outnumbered
Cross the membrane, barking big game and get hunted
Eye witness account, say it happened so sudden
Just slid off to the side, didn't really say nuttin
Then BLAOW, blew away the 1900th
You better get your rest cause the next day comin
Oh yes, and MCs, they scared to say sum'tin
Stop frontin, I'm in the cut just onlookin
Your get your kings, your rooks, rings and pawns tooken

And rock uniforms that's made for nurses
I burst your verses, your words is worthless
Only touching surface, the fuck's the purpose?
I shot the sherriff, the deputy, and head of bank treasury
So mounties in the county got a big bounty stressin me
But tell 'em to hold off, they too short to measure me

From the muscle kid I'm one of the illest of all time
I swing from chandeliers and wall climb
And specialize in warfares of all kind
A lot of MCs said I'm a run it down rhyme
But half the time, they running down one of mine
Thought suffocating 'em with yet another stunning line
You dumb and blind kid, it's enlarged and underlined
What I memorized leave your whole staff pressurized
Melt down all of your artificial lies
Y'all niggas is faker than Yellow No. 5
Swine like mono and diglyceride
My vocals got texture, you just texturized
I'm nicer than your writtens even when I'm improvised
Step into my zone get flown like fly
By the b-boy Lazarus who just won't die
Yo, me and Kamal and Leonard Hubbard, Questlove and Malik
We go back to dollar hoagies and Tahitian Treat
Or like toast in the oven with government cheese bubbling
Me and Dante like Marvin, the trouble men travelling
Give me the mic, we on that again
B-boy business, off the top acting and battling
Serving them cats that forgot
But don't get too close because you might get shot

Like blaow-ba-dow-da-da-dow-da-dah-dow
Either stand tall or sit the fuck down
All the way from the 2-1-5th to Bucktown
Brace yourself, it's about to go down
Yo Tariq (Whassup?) How your microphone sound?
(It sound tight) Well aight, show 'em what it's about
We got to blow up the spot because they must have forget
We double (Trouble) bubble (Bubble) bubble, bubblin' hot
We go blaow-ba-dow-da-da-dow-da-dah-dow
Either stand tall or sit the fuck down
All the way from the 2-1-5th to Bucktown
Went from Do You Want More?!??!! to what you want now?
Yo Tariq (Whattup?) Well how your microphone sound?
(It sound tight) Well aight, show 'em what it's about
We got to blow up the spot because they must have forget
We double (Trouble) bubble (Bubble) bubble, bubblin' hot

Say here's a little story that must be told
About two young brothers who got so much soul
They taking total control, of the body and brain
Flying high in the sky on a lyrical plane
It's just two bad brothers who will never quit
Mos Def and Tariq from the 2-1-5th
They rock beginning to end, on a spiritual blend
And everybody who forgot then baby tell 'em again
It's just me and Tariq, with Ahmir on the beat
The Roots crew baby, yo, we got to make it unique
We got the soul-shockinest, body-rockinest
Non-stoppinest, Fortified Live survive the apocalypse
Rhymes we say, the perfect blend
Because we know how to rock when the beat come in

The Dalai Lama of the mic, the prime minister Thought
This directed to whoever in listening range
Yo the whole state of things in the world 'bout to change
Black rain fallin' from the sky look strange
The ghetto is red hot, we steppin on flames
Yo, it's inflation on the price for fame
And it was all the same, but then the antidote came
The Black Thought, ill syllablist out the Fifth
This heavyweight rap shit I'm about to lift
Like, a phyllum lift up it's seed to sunlight
I plug in the mic, draw like a gunfight
I never use a cordless, or stand applaudless
Sippin' cholorophyll out of ill silver goblets
I'm like a faucet, monopoly's the object
There ain't no way to cut this tap, you gotta get wet
Your head is throbbin and I ain't said shit yet

Whether they skywriting your name or you anonymous
You be speechless with stinging sinuses
The Roots royal highnesses through your monitors
I tilt my crown, then blow down a diamond kiss
You need to buy a CD and stop, rewindin' this
I'm the finalist, shinin like a rugged amethyst
And at your music conference, I'm the panelist
Listen close to my poetry, I examine this
Like an analyst, to see if you can handle this

Walk Alone,How I Got Over,2010.0,"Trapped, no shield, no sword
The unbeaten path got my soul so sore
Allured by the lust, something money can't cure
The Devil want me as is, but God he want more
Eyes closed, eyes open, great another day, here we go
Like a nigga woke up late in 
The Truman Show
Living life without a care, mean pokerface
But I'm forced to play solitaire 'til I get up out of here
Move like a wanted man with a bounty on his head
Work alone, sleep alone, eat alone, daily bread
Counting 'til my fingers red, how you gon' judge a man?
Walking in the shoes of a man with a broken leg
Flame on the trail headed for the powder keg
Last place in the race I ain't never led
Like I ain't never bled, time to get up out of bed
Serving in the army of one, it's on again

Walk alone, I walk alone, you know I walk all alone
I always been on my own
Ever since the day I was born
So I don't mind walking alone
Walk alone, I walk alone, you know I walk all alone
I always been on my own
Ever since the day I was born
So I don't mind walking alone

I'm in a chess match, I'm in a death trap
I'm tryna find out where the eggs in the nest at
I'm one blood when the sky turns jet black
No love in the world can correct that
I'm in a slow lane, I'm on my Cobain
I'm in the new spot tryna run a old game
I got a new chick, put out my old flame
No peace, no sleep, no love for a young beast
You can put me in a cage
You can put me in the jungle where the lion get blazed
There ain't no hell like the hell I raise
I'd die in the bed I made 'fore I lay with a love I loathe
I'm a snake in the garden of bones
I'm a loner in a world of clones
I'm the piece that don't belong, see I roam
Where the Reaper roam 'till they put my name on a stone

Walk alone, I walk alone, you know I walk all alone
I always been on my own
Ever since the day I was born
So I don't mind walking alone
Walk alone, I walk alone, you know I walk all alone
I always been on my own
Ever since the day I was born
So I don't mind walking alone

The longest walk I'll probably ever be on
The road to perdition, guess I'm finna get my plea on
I pray these wings strong enough to carry me on
I promise every second felt as if it took an eon
Walking like the lost boys of Sierra Leone
The trail of tears what they got me like a Cherokee on
Between the ears something I require therapy on
For working to the bone like my name Robert Guillaume
I go above and beyond, the duty called, truly y'all
Even though they kind of blew me off like a booty call
Ask me if I'm just another mouli or a movie star
Forced to face the music like a graduate of Juilliard
Walk alone, talk alone, get my Charlie Parker on
Make my mark alone, shed light upon the dark alone
Get my sparkle on, it's a mission I'm embarking on
A kamikaze in the danger zone far from home

Walk alone, I walk alone, you know I walk all alone
I always been on my own
Ever since the day I was born
So I don't mind walking alone
Walk alone, I walk alone, you know I walk all alone
I always been on my own
Ever since the day I was born
So I don't mind walking alone",https://genius.com/The-roots-walk-alone-lyrics
Who Tells Your Story,The Hamilton Mixtape,2016.0,"Will they tell your story?
This is the story of a
Who lives who dies who tells your story
(Da-da-da-dum da-da-da-dum da-da-da-dum)
This is the story of a
Who lives who dies who tells your story

My mind flashes, I see the ashes of the masters
Who touch the masses, I ask if I'll ever be one
When I die, will heaven be done?
What will my legend become?
I will forever be young
Through old tales of breakdancing down at Odell's
Streets named after me is where my soul dwells
Desires of a church choir, Trinity United
I think of good memories that Hennessy provided
Memories divided by perception
Will it be Water for Chocolate or Resurrection?
The path to perfection is rarely achieved
I head in that direction, I dream and believe
An underground dude that overachieve
From the windy city I was blowing they eaves
Somewhere along the way I aired out MCs
(Who lives who dies who tells your story)
But to stand out some days you may freeze
Degrees

Who lives
And who dies
Who holds on to all our lives?
Time and time and time again
Will they tell your story in the end
(Who lives who dies who tells your story?)

Yo, the anticipation arose as time froze
The black men in the morgue were John Does
Lynched for whistling at blonde does
I said a prayer with my eyes closed
As I loaded the Roscoe's at the sink, yo
I been a bullet on the brink
But being a young king
Probably different than you think, though
The quills that I dip into the ink go to document
And you'll remember me when I'm extinct
Yo, sing the carol of a young pharaoh
Who slew Leviathan with one arrow
As I revolve through the gun barrel just to watch it unravel
I tell them have heart, must travel
Keep my legacy alive even if I don't survive 'til the curtain call
First of all, realize what we working towards
Fuck around, find what we searching for
(Who lives who dies who tells your story?)
The earth, my name written in cursive form

Who lives
And who dies
Who holds on to all our lives?
Time and time and time again
Will they tell your story in the end
(Who lives who dies who tells your story?)

Who lives
And who dies
Who holds on to our lives?
Time and time and time again
Will they tell your story in the end?
(Who lives who dies who tells your story?)

Frozen in time, I can't let it go
Nat Cole, Unforgettable
The pedestal I'm on, I'mma end up on the Federal
Reserve note your money with a hip hop quote
I might change legislation with some shit that I wrote
From boats that we came on to lights with our name on
Through hard times, we spark minds to keep the flame on
I write hard rhymes like I'm running out of time
Truthfully, my stopwatch​ is one with the divine
Centuries from now, they'll play my freestyle
And say, this is the brilliance of a Black American child
Endowed by the streets, and the Chi proud
Known to move in silence, but can be loud
The noise of beat girls and boys
Building to destroy the perception of urban aggression
My life is a progression of chords, wrote the oppressors
A chorus, my story is the glory of the Lord

Who lives (who lives)
And who dies (who dies)
Who holds on to all our lives?
Time and time and time again
Will they tell your story in the end?

Founding fathers in a line, looking all humble
Patiently waiting to sign a declaration and start a nation

The reality is not a pretty picture, kids
Every cabinet meeting is like a full-on rumble

To the top love, hip-hop, check it out
It's like, word up, and it sounds so nice
Hip-hop, you the love of my life, of my life

The anticipation arose as time froze
I stared off the stage with my eyes closed and dove
Into the deep cosmos
The impact pushed back, the first five rows
But before the raw live shows, I remember I's a little snot-nosed
Rocking Cazal goggles and Izod clothes
Learning the ropes of ghetto survival
Peeping out the situation I had to slide through
Had to watch my back, my front, plus my sides too
When it came to getting mine, I ain't trying to argue
Sometimes I wouldn'ta made it if it wasn't for you
Hip-hop, you the love of my life and that's true
When I was handling the shit I had to do
It was all for you, from the door for you
Speak through you, getting paper on tour for you
From the start, Thought was down by law for you
Used to hit up every corner store wall for you
We ripped shit, and kept it hardcore for you
I remember late nights, steady rocking the mic
Hip-hop, you the love of my life
So tell the people like that y'all, and it sounds so nice
Hip-hop, you the love of my life
We 'bout to take it to the top

I was speaking, to my guy 'Riq and
How she was desperately seeking to Organize in a Konfusion
Using no protection, told H.E.R. on 
Resurrection
Caught up in the Hype Williams
, 
and lost H.E.R. direction
Getting ate in sections where I wouldn't eat H.E.R
An under the counter love, so silently I treat H.E.R
Her Daddy'll beat H.E.R., eyes all Puff-ed
In the mix on tape, niggas had her in the buff
When we touch, it was more than just a 
Fuck, The Police
In H.E.R. I found peace 
like Malcolm in the East
Seen H.E.R. on the streets of New York, tricking off
Tried to make a hit with H.E.R. but my dick went soft
Moving weight, losing weight
Not picky with who she choose to date
Too confused to hate, with her struggle I relate
Close to thirty, most of the niggas she know is dirty
Having more babies than Lauryn, she started showing early
As of late I realized, that this is H.E.R. fate, or destiny
That brings the best of me, it's like God is testing me
In retrospect, I see she brought life
 and death to me
Peace to us collectively, live and direct, when we
Perform, it's just coffee shop chicks and White dudes
Over H.E.R. I got into it with that nigga Ice Cube
Now the fight moved to in life, making the right moves
Besides God and family, you my life's jewel
Like that y'all

Who baptize glasses with beers and blood stain

Hallelujah, 'til the cops cuff me in the back of a cruiser
Or the fire truck wash my soul down the sewer
I count my blessings
And blow it on a nun to resurrect my erection

Or to a new hell with a Wi-Fi connection
So I can pay for my sins on PayPal

75 Bars (Black’s Reconstruction),Rising Down,2008.0,"Just a little bit more
We got Tariq up?

I'm from the land of them straight razor face beard niggas
With hammers on their waist, yeah, waste weird niggas
And erase scared niggas, them snake-head niggas
That take care of niggas who don't break bread with us
Niggas make dead niggas, and hate Black niggas
Brown niggas, high yellow niggas and them red niggas
No tellin' when the bullet comin', be prepared, niggas
'Cause when it do, it's coming land, sea and air, niggas
That's everywhere, niggas
Am I the motherfuckin' legendary? Yeah, niggas
Make it very clear, niggas
Been looking at y'all in my rearview mirror, niggas
Wanna be a millionaire, I'm already there, niggas
I'm a debonaire nigga, a bear taking more than my share
Looky here, yeah, I know it ain't fair, nigga
Neither is a bald eagle with a hair trigger
Haystack—try to find a needle up in there, nigga
Leave you up in there, nigga
Show me the puppet that don't need a puppeteer, nigga
Shed another tear, nigga
I'm in the field with a shield and a spear, nigga
I'm in your girl with her heels in the air, nigga
I am such a rare nigga
You in a battle telling me you not ready
Like you figured I'ma bear with you
I don't care, nigga
You now listening to the sounds of the 
Money Making Jam Trillionaires
, nigga
Gentlemen of an extraordinary league
You never see me blowing on no ordinary weed
What I'm smoking ain't a product of no ordinary seed
Your boy is heavy tree'd
I'm feeling merry as a Tyler Perry scene
That monetary gangrene
We tried to launder the cash and never came clean
So now, I'm in the story with all the cats before me
And smoke purgatory for doing the same thing
And them niggas ain't change, them niggas can't change
Their moms shake they heads, say, ""It's such a dang shame""
The train to the bus then another dang plane
My stage and my government ain't the same name
I'm a rockstar, love it that my wallet chain hang
I'm a modern day saint, I'm a modern day Kane
My definition, I can finally explain
Cold smooth like that dude Sean Connery was playing
I just gotta be the man, I'm the father figure and
When I spit, it's something like a psychology exam
If you stand where I stood, you could probably understand
How that mic feeling like a million dollars in my hand
It's the silence of the lamb, go and cop another gram
And twist with your Xanny, Percocet, Percodan
What's your networking plan? You better look alive
'Cause them niggas outside looking desperate again, nigga
And the blunts and liquor killing our lungs and liver
The asthmatic drug addict, I function with it
I put a rapper in a hole where the dust will sit
For spitting played out patterns that once was hittin'
I got news for you all, let me show you how to ball
See the legendary fall, I ain't heard of that
Y'all niggas is off the wall like Arsenio Hall
I'ma put you right back where the dirt is at
450 Fahrenheit on the thermostat
Somebody starvin' like a white girl
, Bernadette
But she not a earner yet
She couldn't put in no work for Nat Burner yet
The black microphone murder vet, I'm in a class of my own
If I got beef with you, you the last one to know
I arrive on time, I'm never fashionable
You late, I'm already internationable
I done twirled in Berlin, banged in Beijing
You never seen nothing, can't say the same thing
Tell somebody ""Black Thought,"" yeah, you know the name ring
So give him the game ring for bringing what them niggas can't bring
My hustle is long, my muscle is strong
My man put the paper in the duffle, I'm gone
Y'all still a lightyear from the level I'm on
Just a pawn stepping right into the head of the storm
You been warned, I will blow y'all niggas and disintegrate
I'm a rebel, renegade, must stay paid",https://genius.com/The-roots-75-bars-blacks-reconstruction-lyrics
The Dark (Trinity),…and then you shoot your cousin,2014.0,"Yo, mountain high and valley low and river wide and tunnel deep
I have traveled chasing demons, screaming ""All I find I keep""
If you don't pay like you weigh, alright, okay, that's fine with me
I'ma display my heat and say my piece and lay you down to sleep
Ain't nobody tell you clowns to speak, I'ma AK you down the street
Draw that pump that's built for the riots, see how quiet y'all can keep
Ain't no wilding, it ain't no problem, ain't no question, it ain't no beef
Cut that check then things are sweet, I'ma go buy some diamond teeth
I'll be damned if my setback gon' help you get back on your feet
No surrender, no retreat, nigga we out here tryna eat
Hashtag, diamond dog tag, money bag, nice swag
Pockets need an ice bag, toe tag, body bag
Niggas lose their lives sad, rockets in their flight path
Breaking bad, making bad, choices out here, thinking fast
Smoking wet and drinking bad, soaking wet and sinking fast
Shoot them niggas making cash, stick them niggas, take their stash
The law of gravity meets, the law of averages
Ain't no sense in attempting to civilize savages
Even though I wish I could be spared my embarrassment
I'm a nigga, other niggas pale in comparison
We out in Paris yet but still a nigga perishing
No idea how much time's left, fuck tryna cherish it
A life in times unchecked, now that's American
Inherit the wind, pressure in everything

The world ain’t ready for someone like me
When life is sex, drugs, drama and I’m hooked on all three
I’d rather OD than be the next OG
That's fraudin' for a whore that already chose me
One man revolution, that’s supportin prostitution
I’m tryna pimp the game, where balling don’t mean hooping
And ridin' don't mean cruisin', it mean keep your bitch ass movin'
If you ain’t built for bruising, redrum ain’t in your blueprint
In a jungle made of concrete, every animal Jumanji
On Eazy-E and PCP, ass cash or EBT
How you monetize pigeons on a power line?
On the road to the riches, every dude's a dollar sign
I don’t mind, I don’t mind, long as all the smoke is mine
And the liquor store delivers faster than a Papa Johns
And I heard that death is calling, money’s on the other line
The last episode of Good Times is my life

It's a phrase they say in the streets
When the young players meet: ""Get rich or die trying""
But the funny thing about that phrase to me
Is that these little niggas be lying
Cause don’t nobody wanna die
But everybody tryna get rich though
But the fucked up thing about that
These lil' niggas, they don’t how to get rich so
I still run with those angels
Man I still peep all those angles
Speaking with guns, speaking in tongues
Talking that Arabic and that Yiddish
Riding them trains, stashing them chains, bangles
Yeah, I played all those games though
My tag on the wall, you niggas look up
You can still see my name yo
How did I end up where I’m at? It’s kind of hard to explain yo
I remember all I wanted was a gold chain and a Kangol
I remember all I wanted was a gold chain and some Jordans
To impress that bitch, then I got that bitch
Now all I want from her’s an abortion
My mind filled with distortion, my eyelids say caution
Yeah I sold crack to get my soul back, they say it’s gon cost a fortune
And I wonder if Allah take debit, cause a nigga got real bad credit
If not, I ain’t got a whole lot so a nigga like me just can forget it, ha!",https://genius.com/The-roots-the-dark-trinity-lyrics
Web,The Tipping Point,2004.0,"Uh huh
Uh
And it weighs a ton
'Riq Geez motherfuckers I'm a son of a gun
Black master of any trade under the sun
Talk sharp like a razor blade under the tongue
Clear my path and come get your captain hung
Trying to breathe like Black'll collapse your lungs
Young chump you could choke off the web I spun
I done cleared 'em out from the threat I brung
You done heard about what set I'm from
My nigga, word of mouth little rule-a-thumb
Y'all better bow down when the ruler come
I'm a real hood nigga not a hood-a-lum
The way Thought put it down be confusin' some of y'all
Cats can't walk while chewin' your gum 'n all
What a keyboard got to do with a drum and all
School 'em on stage like I'm doin' a seminar
Professional type, I'm adjustin' my mic
Go to war kid I'll give you any weapon you like
Give you something to run from, bust off your dum-dums
Stop kid, that hot shit you know where it come from
It's Philly world-wide phenomenon
And reinforcin' that shit is my 9-to-5
And when I finish making you recognize
I'm getin' at a couple civilized women that's tryin' to ride
You been waitin' on the boul to come off to all
You wanna get the bitches up off the wall
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself
To keep you in health, this for all of y'all
I'm quick on the draw like Black McGraw
And I can't tell what y'all cats rappin' for
My name 'riq Geez and I'm back for more
To get more chips than the corner store
With a portrait of Malcom X on the door
While I'm eatin' MCs like a carnivore
Matter fact, ease back 'fore you get harmed
Ring the warning horn when I'm gon' perform
The first nigga that move, or disturb the goove
I'mma have y'all flicks on the evening news
Play y'all part - get on y'all P's and Q's
And when y'all face Thought, be prepared to lose
Bring money to spend and somebody to lend
And some worthwhile money not twenties and tens
Get took for your tuck right in front of your hens
Who coulda helped you, nigga? not none of ya friends
Because, I put a black fist under ya chin
Have your physical remains found under the pen
If I'm coming up in the place, I'm coming to win
Wasn't in it for a minute, now I'm dumbin' again
'riq Geez, akh, y'all can chat what y'all please
Receive what I'm gonna get back to y'all believe
'cuz you don't really wanna get clapped with all these
My man, you can take y'all strap when y'all leave
You see the squad come in the place, they all freeze
Ice Cold, with his mellow Cool Breeze
MCs never showed loyalty yet
Kool Herc ain't never get a royalty check
I do work, no question, and bomb your set
I'm calm collect, sharp like my name Gillette
RIP my man Gillette until I touch the mic
Y'all people ain't seen danger yet
I'm a decorated vet, I regulate and wreck
Never hesitated yet, I'm gettin' heavy weighted checks
If you would dare ask if I'm dedicated - yes
I spit live rounds that'll penetrate a vest
Nigga, take ya seats I'm a demonstrate a test
How to freak the beats, so gangsta fresh
And it thump, from the east coast to Bangladesh
Big bank Willy Gank smoke the thing to death
But hold tight, cuz it's not over yet
I don't even feel like I'm not sober yet
And it ring like shots in the projects New Year's Eve
And it ain't even October yet
I'm a big bounty hunter like Boba Fett
Y'all more shell shocked then a soldier get
If the prize in my sights then I'm goin' for this
Whoo whoo 'riq Geez be the ultimate
I'm the culprit, give me the bulk of this
'riq set it on the magnetic ultra tip
Get down how you 'posed to get
I got nothing to lose, I'm a killer with no regrets
I'm like young LL, cuz I'm hard as hell
Makin' niggas screw face like Gargamel
Now I'm all out on my own like Patti LaBelle

Clock With No Hands,Game Theory,2006.0,"Yeah, sitting in the staircase, holding back tears
Looking over mad years worth of photographs
Pictures of some places I ain't never going back
Some people I used to love, why I ain't show them that?
The skies was overcast, when I was sober last
My head is spinning, couldn't tell you if it's slow or fast
It's starting to get too clear, I got to go and grab
To y'all it's a shame but life is what we know it as
Waiting, navigating the plot, without plans
In the cards, it's hard to read as a clock with no hands
How your mans gonna get up his stock with no yams
All it take is one break, it could pop the program
Whether sinning or not, my back bending like I'm sendin' salaat
I feel some brothers is beginning to plot
It might have been a close friend I forgot
Who started up and ain't remember to stop
I bet these niggas going remember the shop

People think that I'm crazy, just cause I wanna be alone
You can't depend on friends to help you in a squeeze
We all deal with shit on our own
And sometimes the beef can grow, get out of hand
Yeah, you know it gets full blown
I never said that you mean the world to me
Maybe it's best that you never know

Yo, I'm like Malcolm out the window with the weapon out
Searching for somehow to find a minute or the second now
Precious time is money that I ain't got to mess about
Need it from the horse's mouth or from an eyewitness account
Lessons with my back to the wall, scoping my session out
Stay a little edgy at times when I ain't stressing bout
Haters don't know shit about me, they the ones that talk shit
Those that love me send it out, so I ain't got to force quit
'Cause I'm doing better now, don't mean I never lost shit
I was married to a state of mind and I divorced it, man
I'm from where brothers moving product from the porches
People locking their doors, clutching to their crosses
The block hot by the law, there ain't too many choices
So what I do is for y'all, there ain't too many voices left
I watch my back, and watch my step
And I might forgive, but I do not forget, come on

People think that I'm crazy, just cause I wanna be alone
You can't depend on friends to help you in a squeeze
We all deal with shit on our own
And sometimes the beef can grow, get out of hand
Yeah, you know it gets full blown
I never said that you mean the world to me
Maybe it's best that you never know

Yo, living in turbulent times
The blind leading the blind
Some call it evolution, some say intelligent design
You say you want a revolution, you out of your mizind
Your sons' destitute, and their pops all in the prison
My man's back in the jam, he like the back of my hand
He just attracted to scam, he right back in the can
I never sleepwalk when you dead
You get your shuteye
I'm on the first thing in, I'm leaving on the red-eye
My brother back in rehab, just had another relapse
Within himself, it's been like he's been fighting an inner Jihad
Telling me ain't nobody true when they pretend to be that
So closer than friends, that's where I keep my enemy at
To any parties concerned, it's time to live it and learn
Until we're able to grow, forever bridges we burn
My thoughts free as a bird, that's just about to emerge
And every action is heard, it speaks louder than words, yo

People think that I'm crazy, just cause I wanna be alone
You can't depend on friends to help you in a squeeze
We all deal with shit on our own
And sometimes the beef can grow, get out of hand
Yeah, you know it gets full blown
I never said that you mean the world to me
Maybe it's best that you never know",https://genius.com/The-roots-clock-with-no-hands-lyrics
Guns Are Drawn,The Tipping Point,2004.0,"So what are you going to do when the guns are drawn?

Yeah it would be cool it could be too
Stop running round in circles off of what we fuel
Living a lie eventually believing it's true
A lot of people here are frauds one could be you
It's outrageous and they just ain't nothing
But save us an ocean of brown fists in various flavors
A favor for a favor man, this is the majors
Tell me what you would do with no phone or pagers
No Kinko's, no Fed Ex and no ATM's
What you gone do when the police state begins
Well it already began but I guess it depends on
What's really going on, what's happening, huh
Military target practicing
They finna write another Patriot Act again
The days is short the nights is long
The fight goes on
The pistol and the pipes are drawn

The middle of the night we fight like  Barbarians in sight of the former might
You might think that it's a waste
Of our time
And I think you would be right
Till he drop that rhyme
The middle of the night we fight like  Barbarians in sight of the former might
You might think that it's a waste
Of our time
And I think you would be right
Till he drop that rhyme

And some might say that it's a waste of time
Cause ain't no amount of dancing finna break the bondage
We go to war and transcend space and time
When every record ain't a record just to shake behinds
You know the stakes is high we in the face of drama
That's why we can't shake it or escape the problem
Its like a game of roulette the barrel revolving
They only wanna see us occupying a coffin
Mothers crying too often from they lost child leaving
From trying to get over, get under, get even
Get inside getting, getting dumped, getting greedy
We got to get it right
It ain't about to be easy
You better pull you goggles up, it's about to get greasy
Believe it's on as long as we can still speak freely
The pages of my life would make it hard to read me
I know my people hearing me, holler if y'all need me

The middle of the night we fight like  Barbarians in sight of the former might
You might think that it's a waste
Of our time
And I think you would be right
Till he drop that rhyme
The middle of the night we fight like  Barbarians in sight of the former might
You might think that it's a waste
Of our time
And I think you would be right

The Day,How I Got Over,2010.0,"When I wake up, I look into the mirror
I can see a clearer, vision, I should start living today
Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day
Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day

Yeah, it's like everyday I wake up, I stare into space and don't say much
Peer in the mirror, feeling dead from the face up
Coffee pots, cigarettes, morning J's, Baileys
Slowing down my day before it picks up the pace
Beats playing since the night before, thinking about writing songs
Feeling exhausted from times we toured constant
And plus the toxins I sip got me tall
Still tipsy, staring at the city from the spot we call Los Angeles
Every day is like a blank canvas
Carving my initials in the planet like I brand it
Hand picked to live this life we take for granted
Like a child with an upright bass, we can't stand it
Smiling through the trouble we face, tryna manage
My way without pumping my brakes and staying stagnant
Cause I can sit on my ass or just imagine
The madness I did on my path and paint the canvas

When I wake up, I look into the mirror
I can see a clearer, vision, I should start living today
Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day
Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day

Before I rise and shine like a neon sign
I need the girl of my dreams to give me Einstein
And burn the marijuan' like Buju Banton
It's my only bonafide break from these confines
I need a change of scenery like a montage
These kids bringing me the noise like the Bomb Squad
And everybody coming at me from the blindside
I'm tired, it's hard to open up my eyes wide
I listen to some theme music on the iPod
And walk around the crib doing little odd jobs
Checking my breath, take a view from this high rise
Feeling like I'm checking out a game from the sideline
I got to try different things in these trying times
2010 is different than it was in '9-5
It's come alive time, I picked a fine time
For getting open off life like a fine wine

When I wake up, I look into the mirror
I can see a clearer, vision, I should start living today
Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day
Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day

Uh, yeah, Sunday morning, plan my day out
Whole new blueprint, brand new layout
Deep down still don't know if it'll play out
But for the first time, feel like I done found a way out
Skin getting clearer and it feel like I lost weight
Stop and say a prayer for the times I lost faith
Troubles of the world had me in a cross-face
Chicken-wing, sickening, living so off-base
But now it's like I'm in the last lap of the car chase
And I finally understand my right to choose
My preacher man told me it could always be worse
Even the three-legged dog still got three good legs to lose
So you can stop and refresh the rules
Breathe in, breathe out, let it heal all your exit wounds
Something inside said that's the move
And maybe today I'll restart fresh and new

When I wake up, I look into the mirror
I can see a clearer, vision, I should start living today
Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day
Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day
Is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day
Is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day
Is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day
Is gonna be the day",https://genius.com/The-roots-the-day-lyrics

I pray it don't pass me by

Until you find yourself

It Ain’t Fair,Detroit (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack),2017.0,"Oh, brother, hmm
It's still a mystery, yeah
Will you hear my cry?
Won't you hear my plea? Ohhhhh, ohhh
'Cause I'll never know (I'll never know)
How it feels (How it feels)
How it feels (How it feels)
Oh, how it feels (How it feels)
To be
To be
Free

People swear they woke, but they walking in their sleep
I pray the Lord their souls to keep
Because wolves disguised as sheep patrol our streets
And we all know, that which you sow, you shall reap
Those who do know, you should teach
Through every loophole, we gon' leap until you reach
A common ground and become unbound
Because when your whole town becomes a battleground
Tears raining down

Because it ain't fair
It's hard when you're looking for love
And it ain't there
Or trying to read what tomorrow holds
When it ain't clear
Because the well is running dry
Race-tension is running high
Under 21 is far too young to die
My salvation's under fire
This marks a rising of the tide

Every day I wear a mask like an umpire
Guess a nigga gotta laugh to keep from crying
Tonight another friend passed on the young side
It's bad 'cause a good friend's hard to come by
Justice is never color blind, never gun shy
For one crime, you may never see the sun shine
We know of one times, giving you the finger
'round hear it means, fuck you, it's not the number one sign
I hear they turning downtown to the front line
It's something like the same place but it ain't safe
They took it from the human race to a tank chase
The Devil feeding off hate so he gain weight
There's tainted waters in the well, so we can't taste
People dazed and amazed though it ain't grace
Impossible to coexist in the same space
Enter the black saint with the war-paint face

This generation, we've forsaken all that's real
What emotions do we feel?
Is your poison called a pistol—or a pill?
Some people say, ""Let Jesus take the wheel""
Others say, ""Thou shall not kill""
But that old time religion ain't gon' pay my bills
We've come so far, yet, here we are
Bruised and scarred, presumed inferior
We ain't scared o' y'all

It ain't fair
It's hard when you're looking for love
And it ain't there
Or try to read what tomorrow holds
When it ain't clear
Because the well is running dry
Racial tension is running high
Under 21 is far too young to die
My salvation's under fire
Rising and rising, oh!

To my, Arabs, Israelis, Native American, Mexicans
Invested in wrestling with Willie Lynch's next to kin
The rising of the tide, noose around the necks again
Look how they try to hide proof of all the excellence
The only tag you know me as is Holy Swag
Through any glass window, we smash, and bro we back
It's come to pass, I'm unabashed, so we have
An awareness of the only flag that's growing fast
I guess I'm tryna minimize regrets, I identify with death
That don't mean it's not an uninvited guest
I'm just tryna answer all of my requests
And express, in 140 characters or less
Why I'm the best educator, re-legislated, premeditated
Dedicated, heavy weight that ever paid it with blood
Not tuition without a cop's permission
I got a pot to piss in despite the opposition
Listen

Oh, it ain't fair
It's hard when you're looking for love
But it ain't there
Try to read what tomorrow holds
And it ain't clear
Because the well is running dry
And it ain't fair
No, it ain't there
No, it ain't fair
Looking for justice and it's just us
It ain't fair
There's a riot going on out there
And it ain't fair
When your protector is your predator
It ain't fair
No, it ain't fair
No, it ain't fair
Y'all just gon' turn the other way
No, it ain't fair
Turn a bloody cheek on these bloody streets
It ain't fair
It ain't fair
It ain't fair
No, it ain't fair
No, no
No, no
No, no

Right On,How I Got Over,2010,"Hit it!

We should shine a light on, a light on
And the Book of Right On is right on, it was right on
We should shine a light on, a light on
And the Book of Right On is right on, it was right on

Yo, I try to get it how I live it
A lot of people counting on me kinda like a digit
It's a cold world, I'm not fronting like it isn't
It's no time for coming up shorter than a midget
Y'all know I'ma raise the bar though like Brigitte
See there a star go, don't blink, you might miss it
It's precious cargo, you gotta be strong to lift it
The light comes in different types, be more specific
Shit, I'm Black Thought, what could be more prolific?
For this love, I go above and beyond the limit
I told y'all I'm above and beyond a gimmick
I get into your head and spread like a pandemic
I never put myself in a race I can't finish
I'm well grounded, founded on the same premise
As any man with a hitlist that's about business
Yo, can a brother get a witness? Dig it
Right on

We should shine a light on, a light on
And the Book of Right On is right on, it was right on
We should shine a light on, a light on
And the Book of Right On is right on, it was right on

Okay, I'm above and beyond hot, my measurement in watts
Time rate of flow and energy ain't never gon' stop
Pressure's on, I won't pop, microphone I won't drop
Gemstones niggas cop ain't shit if I ain't in the spot
It's the Orion of the hop, the new star of the hip
I shine a light for the future so my presence's a gift
It's evident I'm heaven sent with Thomas Edison elements
Reverence for what I represent should show my benevolence
This is Philly, I'm repping for the art of the city
Came from southwest Atlanta, gave my heart to the city
Where slugs fly, thugs cry cause every part of it's gritty
Niggas shooting up the club like they party with Diddy
You get the diggy? 
I flip my incandescence to fluorescence
And in essence I can burn more joules of energy per second
I put them on to lessons while I'm smoking on the blessing
The switch hitter like Pete Rose, right up the session
Right on

We should shine a light on, a light on
And the Book of Right On is right on, it was right on
We should shine a light on, a light on
And the Book of Right On is right on, it was right on

Take it to the very top

Respond/React,Illadelph Halflife,1996.0,"It's just - hip-hop hangin in my head heavy
Malik said ""Riq, you know the planet ain't ready
For the half"" when we comin' with the action pack
On some Dundee shit representin' the outback
Yo, we do it like this (
All the way live, from 2-1-5

You witnessin' the 5th Dynasty family click

Across the map, one time for ya (All the way live, from 2-1-5)
It's time to react to respond to react to respond (All the way live, from 2-1-5)

We settin' it from Southside, pushin' this up North
From Illadelphian reps, to fly points across the map
Bring it back to Respond/React
Then bring it back to Respond/React to this

The attractive assassin, blastin' the devil trespassin'
Master gettin' cash in an orderly fashion
Message to the fake nigga flashin'
Slow up, Ock, before you get dropped and closed like a caption
Fractional kids don't know the time for action
Styles got the rhythm that of an Anglo-Saxon
Round of applause, an avalanche of clappin'
{*BLOW*} that's what happen, now what's your reaction?
We heavyweight traction, pro-pornographin'
Specialize in science and math and
Original black man, bustin' thoughts that pierce your mental
The fierce rippin' your sacks and
Vocal toe-to-toe impeccable, splittin' your back, son
Simple as addition and subtraction
Black Thought, the infinite relaxed one
Shorties say they love it with a passion
Bring the international traum', see a squad I harass

REACT, you best adapt when I sling this rap
Another chapter, before when I have to trap ya
Map your whole path out
Go get your crowd so we can clap out
I drive down streets and take back route positionin'
When I'm in your system like glycerin
Fans listenin' from Michigan to Switzerland
Malik be bliss again - on the station with the discipline
Solicitin', sometimes illicit or explicit with it and
From the deep end where the hills are steep
Nobody cares to speak, a land where life is cheap
The street mentality, mixed with the intellect personality
Hell where I dwell as well
Niggas rebellious, bodies are found down in the cellars
My man caught a shot to the stomach, now, who want it?
Confronted by these dusty blunted cats who act like
They don't know that the fact is that they're bein hunted
A process of elimination
Activate your mind with the stimulation
Enter your zone with penetration
I've seen more horror than Bram Stroker
Strip your broad or play poker, then drink mocha
The sometimes socializer, the joke despiser
You woke the wiser, dealin' with the Roots vocalizer
Up in your flesh from South Philly to West
I stampede your style, I'll compile then bless

Aiyo, I'm just a lyricist, a chemist of the hemp
The beat pimp
, the ill Philly resident
That's far from hesitant, corrupt like a President
Never benevolent, but poetically prevalent
Cooler than peppermint
The Lieutenant for niggas talkin' bout represent
No doubt, it's obviously evident I get bent
Far from temporary, son, I'm very permanent
Hittin' MC's like an intoxicant, sent to prevent
Monopoly is my intent, the means is what I invent
This mental murder pay the rent
Lyrically I'm the dominant ingredient, the swift extravagant
Smooth lubricant, down with the M-the-Ill-itant
(ch-ch-ch...) That's the sound of the Dynasty chant
We surround your camp, assumin' the war stance
And bring it from the chest, now let's daaance

M-ILL-ITANT, feel the 5th guerilla chant
Y'all talk about bodies but you would not kill a ant
My skill is amp, would peel a nigga like a stamp
Caliber is of Excalibur now you be damp
When I operate a crowd will copulate
My game'll make a room populate and 2-1-5th is the stock of hate
Peep the logistics, slump your squad of misfits
They all get they wrists slit, blast your ass if you insist it
Leave no trace so there's no trace for ballistics
Turn your soul and body to statistics
In particular, I've got that extracurricular
Squad in the stash who could be stickin' ya
Slip and they vickin' ya
Harass your po-lice commissioner
Don't like chicks with weaves talkin' 'bout, ""I need conditioner""
That shit's deader than niggas with a morticianer
A jenazah
, up in your flesh like plasma
Take away your last breath when you got asthma
Then meet Bad Lieu down at the plaza
Hip-hop extravaganza, tell your man I slump him with a stanza
Now ""Who's the Boss?"", not Tony Danza
My force not green but the force is obscene
P.O. took a piss test it came out not clean
Brody with my man Miz-Moose and Hakeem
My squad from deuce-four up to West Oak Lane
All the way to Tackawanna and Frankford, they know the name
It's like that... M-Ill-itant

M-Ill-itant, lyrically hostile, Bad Lieutenant

Radio Daze,How I Got Over,2010.0,"And the radio daze kept us in the dark
And the satellite age brings us to the light
Some feeling the pinch, some feeling the bite
They ain't ready to talk, they're ready to fight
Never leave you alone (Never, I never leave you alone)
(Never, I never leave you alone)
Never leave you alone (Never, I never leave you alone)
(Never, I never leave you alone)

Yo, so what you searching for?
From birth, born hurting and yearning for certain somethings
Lurking and murk 'em, got 'em turning this
Bed into a coffin, burning over passions in this passion
Or more or less over what the pastor passed us
Cause see, the past tense, it never really passes
Phases that trap us and cage us like classes
Fogging my glasses, lost in a mass mess
Taskless dilemma to match somebody's status
And I'm average as fuck, no car cats gassing me up
Passing bucks like a casual blunt
Granted, hustling habits on the stump of a mansion
While bums pass, asking for a buck for some bagged bricks
Bad shit going down on the daily
While bad chicks pass in a Mercedes, damn
They see he's the bastard for chasing them
Maybe it's the patterns that make me that made me, crazy

And the radio daze kept us in the dark
And the satellite age brings us to the light
Some feeling the pitch, some feeling the bite
They ain't ready to talk, they're ready to fight
Never leave you alone (Never, I never leave you alone)
(Never, I never leave you alone)
Never leave you alone (Never, I never leave you alone)
(Never, I never leave you alone)

Life is fiction, competition and contradiction
Petty perceptions, window dressing for misdirection
Love is a lotto, I know I know you know what I know
Hope is so hollow, that's why winos follow the bottle
And people pressure, make death a hidden treasure
A guilty pleasure, lonely language inside a letter
It's now or never
, move it, move it, love it or lose it
'Fore it's recruited, then included in something stupid
It's things of nature, paid a player and say your prayers
Naysayers, the haters, the major players, the beggars
You 'bout it, 'bout it, don't allow it to pow without it
Then those who doubt it, doomed to die the death of cowards
The world is yours, and the world we can't afford
So ignore the law, start a fire then start a war
If you're sick and tired of your access denied
Free will died long before blogs and iPod

And the radio daze kept us in the dark
And the satellite age brings us to the light
Some feeling the pitch, some feeling the bite
They ain't ready to talk, they're ready to fight
Never leave you alone (Never, I never leave you alone)
(Never, I never leave you alone)
Never leave you alone (Never, I never leave you alone)
(Never, I never leave you alone)

Yo, it's too much strain for nominal gain
I'm going through things; headaches, abdominal pain
Tryna numb it with that Ketel like I'm from the Ukraine
Check the blue flame, lighter running out of butane
What's up with my destructive urge that's unproductive
Choices I'm stuck with, now starting to fuck with
Contaminating family and close friends
Telling me to stop burning the candle at both ends
Ain't like I'm on a coke binge, hanging in dope dens
Or life is just a pool of Patron I'm soaked in
The darker the covenant slash trainwreck for you to rubberneck
You ain't felt the true pain yet so you be loving that
Hit me up at black.gov like the government
Banana Republican
, alien intelligence
Kill switch, real pissed, thinking of some ill shit
The stone the builder refused, he need to build with
Got immunized for both flus, I'm still sick
Via satellite, radio, the realness

And the radio daze kept us in the dark
And the satellite age brings us to the light
Some feeling the pitch, some feeling the bite
They ain't ready to talk, they're ready to fight
And the radio daze
And the radio daze
And the radio daze",https://genius.com/The-roots-radio-daze-lyrics
Clones,Illadelph Halflife,1996.0,"To all the Jim Carrey-ass large co-op
KnowhatI'msayin? Large co-op, what the fuck
To the clones, we bless the domes
Blow the vial, you know my style, large co-op
Freestyle all the way son
Dice

First of all, let's talk about these ill capers
And fly ass frontin' bitches that now caught vapors
Niggas run up on you with guns, snatchin' papers
Outlined body chalk, is how they would scrape ya
From off the pavement, I hate gettin' locked up
'Cause that upstate bus reminds me of the slave ships
But then The Bible never saved shit
I guess that's why every juvenile is in the same predicament
You wanna slang crack, or hold TECs, and do the concept
You can't make loot when your moms is smokin' up the product
I try to tell ya, don't let these streets fuckin' fail ya
The way niggas be gettin' clapped, the shit'll fuckin' scare ya
But in the dark, we ran wild, son, we killin' em
Niggas scared, can't stand still like fuckin' helium
Fake niggas, they don't go platinum, they go aluminum
Got 'em cloned the fuck up, son, that's why we losin' 'em
I'm lookin' at this nigga's longevity
To make a big play, but then, it might be a mistake
'Cause if I get sent to D.C., I'm sendin' Dice to D.E
With three p's, so when I get out, he can see me
For real, 'cause the streets is filled with snakes and rats
The snake will be that bitch and that rat will be that cool cat
With swollen pockets we gonna take you back home
Master-Allah-Rule-Savior, never clone

I use the mic to slap you in the face and erase your taste
Disgrace your date, put your title to waste
Dominant lyrical grace from a place
Called wild Illadelph Isle Pensy, that's the residency
Consistent currency, my pocket's never empty
Some cats believe they MC, but we know they all fraud
Do a show in Philly, niggas wouldn't applaud
Nobody know your record nor who you openin' for
Can tell your squad's artificial while approachin' the door
So you should prepare for lyrical terror that's pure
Step up to the reservoir of the soul proprietor style
Messiah or, the kaya law down with Dice Raw
The matador, shorty connoisseur
Stompin' whatever you build to the floor
Similar to that of a dinosaur
I told you I'm the rap predator
You insist to imitate, what for?
Superstar niggas is 10% real, 90% invented for a fuckin' record deal
Comin' with somethin' veterans can't feel
I hit you like a steel anvil
Because you grafted off the next man's skill
But still, I remain mellow, seein' the theatrics of Othello
But know the tactics of the P.L.O
These C-L-O-N-E-S fess
The phoniest cats is felonious (word)

Dice Raw, the juvenile lyricist, corner store terrorist
Block trooper, connoisseur of fine cannabis
Focus never weak, blow up the spot like plastique
Leave a nigga shook, to the point he won't speak
Never half-assed, always live and direct
On bitches try to punk, smell the panty and raw sex
Mad lights I had to black out when fake niggas act out
Or step out of place, they get slapped in they face
All y'all niggas is fake, tryin' to emulate my style
What grown man? In this game, to me you're a child
I trained wack MC's in camps like ex-marines
Why the fuck you think you went home and had bad dreams
Of horrifying things that your ass never seen before?
You traveled to the realm of Dice Raw
Where clones get they domes blown with chrome microphones
It's not your fault, black, just the fact you wasn't shown
You'll come through this like a smurf
Unnatural, it’s not from this earth
Represent while I been like this since birth
And I won't be the last, but I definitely was the first
Dice Raw big car Logan Val' sol-dier

Don't come across that line or pay a cost
Knuckle games and hammer cocked, ain't nothin' sweet or soft
Win, lose or draw, to the jaw take one
Deranged lyrical launcher, or station
No conversation is needed, my task completed
Read a nigga up and down in the cut where I'm seated
Snatch you from your cloud of cannabis, you ignoramuses
You laid on your lap when I attacked your glamorous
Lifestyle, I banged your head up with the right fowl
My character a product of this 2-1-5th trife style
I breeze through areas niggas would fear to walk in
Balance the talkin', that galactic style as of a Vulcan
Your Star Trek ass will wrinkle
Spill these words and form into a sprinkle
Cat, you're brought up and the name of twinkle
My insight will crack the windpipe of y'all niggas
Whether small, middle-sized or tall niggas
Just sign your name next when I start to X
Givin' out flesh pains of death, so fuck a rain check
The insane vet, whether you ganked the brain wet
You proceed to lame check, the opposite of same sex
I annihilate your type if you violate
Makin' your blood rush, your pulse now at a higher rate
Uh!
Uh!
Uh!",https://genius.com/The-roots-clones-lyrics

You'll get blown out the sky once shit get talkative

So when you see me on the street, don't bother kid
Just be on your merry way, or you might get slit
Ask around, wondering what Dice Raw did
Lay you on floors like ya getting carpeted

Fuck stardom and chickens up in Gotham

Got soul like those Afro picks with the black fist
And leave a crowd drippin' like John the Baptist
It's the cause of that ""Oh, shit!""

And got many MC's on the blacklist
I'm sharp as a cactus, plus, quick to bust gymnastic tactics
Us, Roots is really true to that rap shit
Now, holla to the scholarly street skats that follow me
Back to the Soul Shack with packs of rap colonies
Max that, Foreign Objects is mad abstract, make Shadrach
Offender wanna go like Meshach, Black
Thought the nappy cat, a bookworm, shoot styles like sperm
Cool as Malcolm Little with conch a la perm burn
The herb sticks like wicks, and flips when I slaps the hand

Clowns bounce to sound when Thoughts poundin', brown's
My complexion, section Southern
My brother-in is Jex, I
Sweats no sex, 'cause this kid gets
Grits 'n shit, it's flex to drains that was crazed
When your heart spit up, dip, dup, damn
Yo, I lost it but back is the Black Boogey Man
Manic mad musician, maker of noise
That's jocked by your homeboys
I rocks my flocks of sheep, it's the slickest shepherd around
I was lost but was found, now I gets down
From Philly to the Apple I, stop and holla tunes and then hit
Up-town, Diggin Planets when they get Earthbound
I kick the groovy tunes for you and yours, when I pass the can
To my mellow my man, Malik B

WHOAHHHHH, shucks, my nuc snuff ducks (uh-huh)
Abruptly I erupt, to destruct, deducts
In wax I like to smack em, stroke em as I cap 'em
Change my name to Saran or Reynolds then I Wrap 'em
Negroes know we be furrow to my borough
Cause my ass is so thorough, like Levert Gerald
Too strong to be sterile
So I impregnates the greats (Say what?)
Bust the Pacino's, I won't trust 'em
Even though I lust 'em shapes -- females for retail prices
Twice this nice as with sugars and spices
I won't smirk, 'cause my name's not Urkel
The voice with the multiple choice, she does a circle
You wanna turn and page your eyes, and try to plagerize
But I degrade ya, slaughtered ya and slayed ya
Microphones I grip equipped to flip the hypocrites
And nit-wits, with tidbit skits, that ain't *shhh*
It was a curse, but I divide it in half
Gets the airplay, no fair play, you're feelin' the wrath
Of Malik, ayo get tragic, negroes that get dramatic
Because I have the habit to smoke rabbits like a addict
So if you can not rap, I will just slap YOU
If you wants to pick up on your nose be shows the chrome
And then we cap, YOU
It's too bad, dem cyan't understand de true check
For my mellow my man

The way we do it like this
That, for my mellow my man
It's like that for my mellow my man
No no we do it like that
This, for my mellow my man
It's like this for my mellow my man
No no we do it like this

Nothin' new, nothin' new, what? Nothin' new, check
Nothin' new, nothin' new, y'all not sayin nothin' new
I represent the legendary Fifth Dynasty crew
Nothin' new, nothin' new, y'all not sayin nothin' new
Nothin' new, nothin' new, y'all not sayin, check this shit out
It's nothin' new, nothin' new, y'all not sayin nothin' new
Nothin' new, nothin' new

Ghetto related with this shit, the whole world awaited
Y'all Dorito-head cats
 that 'gnac and stagnated
Black Thought, the Doug E., most war veteran
Crown ruler, soul controller of this lyrical land
Spliff wizard, kid, who is it? Fifth dinosaur ghetto
Beat detonator, apex my level, next!
My complex patterns of speech is like sex
I mastered the art of makin' you snap ya necks
And Chase Manhattan endorse my mic checks
Upset poet threat just collectin' my debt
Yo, I'm overpaid in dues, blood, tears and sweat
When you fuckin' with The Roots, that's as good as it get
Ultramagnet! We pull you in a Drag-net
Then brainwash your clique and extort your assets
Then roadie all your homies on some old school shit
Roots Crew represent, the next movement!

Life's a gamble, step up and place your bets
I drift through space, then make my escape on through the 'net
With CD's, cassettes, no C.O.D.'s or checks
Straight from the old school, ayo, Raw's in full effect
I'm like, Lex Luther with rifles filled with kryptonite
When you grip the mic, it's like, c'mon kids, let's say goodnight!
You don't like me?! But don't even know why should you hate me
You scared to face these so I still remain safely
Confidin', North Phil' where I'm residin'
Never let an outside nigga slide in
This ain't home plate, I dunk on you once inside the paint
Flow like this, you can't, take me you out, you ain't!

Nothin' new, nothin' new, y'all not sayin' nothin' new
Nothin' new, nothin' new, y'all not sayin' nothin' new
Nothin' new, nothin' new, tell me what you could do
Yo, we drop the funk, and do the shit

Yo, head lost, 
sippin' this Lambic Framboise
Spittin' it for like whoever demand the answer
What's the cure for this hip-hop cancer?
Equivalent to this avalanche of black snow rap flow
To get my people thinkin' mo', we at the brink of war
What does it all mean? What's it all for?
With knowledge of yourself then you're through the first door
My people hungry and thirst for more, next music explore
It's heavenly to your ebony daughter next door
So what you think The Roots get the world respect for?
The splendid authentic hip-hop that's raw core
Severe world premiere, a superior sophomore
No doubt, wherever you dwell, that's where the bomb fell
Explodin' from the imperial en-sem-ble, for real
From the venue to the avenue
We truly only got respect for a few, y'all ain't sayin nothin' new

Nothin' new, nothin' new, y'all not sayin' nothin' new
Represent the legendary Fifth Dynasty crew
Roots crew comin' through, tell me what you could do
Yo, you lookin' for me? Nah, we lookin for you
Nothin' new, nothin' new, y'all not sayin' nothin' new
Represent the legendary, with nothin' to do
For you, yo, lyrical one-two
Blow up y'all, it's nothin' new, nothin' new

Look at y'all, you just a army ant, I'm a giant
Arm fist, king of my city, runnin' this shit just like a tyrant
Y'all clowns know what I meant, that's if we at war
Then my henchmen will be at your back door
Uhh, waitin', wise at debatin'
Trippin' over Legos, runnin'' up the steps and lookin' for a weapon
But you come out wavin' a white flag
That's why I just backslap  like Shaq did Ostertag
Either take me or be taken, you think I'm goin' down?
Psych! The jury, they're still deliberatin'
I got half of they kids tied up in a basement
Nah, I'm just playin', yo, but that's how I'm playin' doe
Dig what I'm sayin', yo? D-I-C-E
Shove a mic in your mouth, like Ted DiBiase
When you come sloppy, fuck is y'all tryin' to do?
Y'all into some wack shit and ain't sayin nothin' new

Nothin' new, nothin' new, y'all not sayin' nothin' new

The Return to Innocence Lost,Things Fall Apart,1999.0,"(Ursula Rucker)
Muffled sound of fist on flesh
Blows to chest
No breath
Air gasps
You ain't nothing but white trash, bitch!
With each hit, each kick, each...broken rib
Crack, Crack!
Bones are crying
Mommy's crying and bleeding
And pleading
And then...
Daddy wants to fuck
Dick hard, swelled with power rush
And as if all that wasn't enough
Mommy's seven months heavy with birth
As...Daddy grunts and cursed drunk nothings in her bloodied ear
(singing softly)
First...lullaby
First...Son...will...ever...hear
And never forget
Mommy almost bled to death when she have him...finally
She'd already lost...three
Uterus-bruised, shredded, and weak
From being daily beat
And Friday nights were the worst and...
Daddy never came with flowers
Instead he spent hours at some corner spot
With some bar pop named Cookie
Putting his thing down
Soiling Mommy's sheets with...
Sweet...talk shit
Cookie's cheap lipstick
Hair grease, sperm, and jezebel juice
To hell with the good news that...
He was a father for the first time
His thirst for wine and women
Clouded his vision...
No warm welcome for mother and son
Just...
The rank smell of ass-crack, funk, and cum
But Mommy's prayerful strength-her best defense
She...burned the dirty linens
Made a fresh bed
Laid sleeping First Son down
And never made a sound
As she purged her scourge
With birth-blood and quiet tears
Watching as her fears and love and sacrifice
Lie there in his soft skin and new life
Breathing, dreaming, fresh from God's eye
Mommy's little survivor
Like...her
Mommy called crazy and scorned
'Cuz she two more born
One boy soon after
The girl much later and...
Although they were both sung the same lullabies of hate
Her...First Son, the first one
Whose...womb-world was profaned
Came of age playing street games
With Stewie, Rezzie, and Little Brother
'Till his heart start to wither
In pain and shame
Blamed Mom for the wrong she let Daddy do to her
And him...
Let...sins of the Father cause his Innocence to wander
Found honor amongst thieves
Chose to squander his dreams
Stopped believing in himself
Become prodigal with his life
Make impossible shit right with...
Gang-ties, crime, lies
Erase wise, woeful words of Mother
Replaced them with absurdities of others
Who had also lost their way
Played a different kind of street game now
First Son plunged deep
Speak street-family vows
Espouse no causes but his own
See, he couldn't protect Mommy's neck from Daddy's grasp
Or...protect Mommy's ass from Daddy's wrath
Couldn't shield her ears from...
Daddy's foul-mouthed, liquor-breath jeers
His only defense-served be confidence
Brown bottles housed his swift descent
Phones called cops on block frequent for his shenanigans
Now...Daddy and him twins in addiction
Driven to false-hearted heavens and friends
By liquefied demons
Had become what he despised from Conception 'til End
Destined for a demise
Survived nine lives of staying high
Conning, jewelry-pawning, arrests, theft
Womanizing...only for money, never for sex
Bullet in chest, baseball bat to the head
Left for dead
So, eyes wide and glassy
Speech...slowed and slurred
Lips twitched with caked-up codeine candy
And mouth corners one December 24th
Mr. Hide and False Friend
Took final ride to suburban supplier
Shots were fired by the gray man
With shaky hand
But not shaky enough to miss...
Hit...Lost Boy in back
So-called Friend runs for door
Leaves First Son blood-born
Lying alone in blood on cold floor
Death was the cost of...
Returning to Innocence Lost...
Baby 'Sis awake for dawn on Christmas morn
To Mommy's sobs and shakes
Daddy's silhouettes of regret
All past, omitted, and absolved by lost
As they clung to each other
Knowing...",https://genius.com/The-roots-the-return-to-innocence-lost-lyrics
Doin’ It Again,How I Got Over,2010.0,"I keep it doin' it again
Oh, I'm doin' it again
Yes, I'm doin' it again
I said it would end

Uh, remix, rising up out of the flames like a phoenix
Straining to carry the weight of my brain like a genius
Knowing I'm sowing seeds, let's see whose thumb is the greenest
If I said, I mean it, I did it because I need it
Eat, sleep it or bleed it, write it down and then read it
Asphalt to the cement, your trash talk, deleted
I blast off, then lay 'em out like a Tempurpedic
It's Black Thought, for certain I'ma win eventually
This unsung, underrated, under-appreciated
The one them underachievers had underestimated
Finally graduated, I'm one of the most hated
Something that's so sacred, nobody gon' take it
Face it, I keep doin' it well
Doin' it sans assistance, just do it yourself
Doin' it below the radar, we doin' it stealth
Doin' it again for Illadelph, yo, who else?
We gon' do it again!

I keep it doin' it again
Oh, I'm doin' it again
Yes, I'm doin' it again
I said it would end

Yeah, ayo, I'm on my job, see my eyes focused where the prize be
Even though they tried to rob me and sabotage the spot
Just like 'Pac when they got him in the lobby
Tried to tax and fine me like Ronald Isley
I's a changed man, ain't no if, and's or probably's
Niggas used to know me, they don't even recognize me
Yep, the P-5-D is who the repertoire be
Doin' it again just like Poitier and Cosby
I'm like Martin Luther King, you like Rodney
The difference is I give it everything inside me
Dear diary, the fans still swear by me
Even though I'm late night now like, ""Here's Johnny""
Swimming with them Great Whites now, that's where to find me
Funny how it break right down, but never mind me
Forever grimey, I guess it's just Philly shining
Rock roller, 
bipolar like Phyllis Hyman

Oh, I'm doin' it again
Yes, I'm doin' it again
I said it would end",https://genius.com/The-roots-doin-it-again-lyrics

My twist like a ratchet in an auto shop
Since granddaddy old Desoto stopped and he got the Caddie
I been gladly servin, any y'all cats wanna act determined
Spit pesticides for rats and vermin
Seem like none of y'all chumps is learning
Y'all hopeless, 
and I'm a little better than dopest
Far from a brand new kid to show biz
Tryna hold on, maintain my focus
Coming out the room with a cloud of smoke of dro and
With the punches
I survive and rock
Cause I keep the crowd alive
And the texture of my voice
Is course and kind of hoarse and cut
Like I'm throwing a thousand knives

Party people, gather round
What we have here is a brand new sound
Reach for my waist you hit the ground
You better duck when that awful sound goes...
(Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom)
Yeah! Thats what's happenin in the parking lot
(Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom)
Thats whats happening on stage

The man at hand that rule the school
And reach and teach the blind and find a way from A to Z
And be the most to boast I'm load and proud
The game and reign that remain
The heat is on so feel the fire come off the empire or the
More higher level of depth one step beyond dope
To suckers all scope and hope to cope but nope
Cause I could never let 'em on top of me
I play 'em out like a game of Monopoly
Let it speed around the board like an Astro
Then send 'em to jail for trying to pass Go
Shaking 'em up, breaking 'em up, taking no stuff
But it still ain't loud enough
So Questlove let the fire roast
So I can flow and we can kill the whole show cause

Party people, gather round
What we have here is a brand new sound
Reach for my waist you hit the ground
You better duck when that awful sound goes...

Yeah! Thats what's happenin in the parking lot
(Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom)
Thats whats happening on stage

I'm live
Design a finer rhyme that's right on time
One step beyond and not behind the line
That seperates thought from divine
You can take it as a caution, or a warning sign
Look for antonyms, words I'm sending em
Homonyms, synonyms good like M&Ms
You know the time when it's Riq Geez slicing
I turn a Mic's last name into Tyson
My brain like a factory constantly creating
Materials stitch by stitch for decoration
My lyrics one fabric the beat is a lining
My passion of rhyming is fashion designing
Now it get sorted cause people wanna sport it ya bought it
If you didn't then you couldn't afford it
Poetry full of surprises it's like a game show
And my brain go, ""I do my thing yo!""

Party people, gather round

That I'm one of the illest in the seven continents

Scully down creepin' while you tilted off Henny
Many man begin pure, but in this world of sin, you're
Holdin' tight, your morale will be injured

Just a cool type of cat, but you still can't understand it
You told to sit back, stand still and chill
Niggas bound to clap shots 'cause they all act ill
With a sour-ass taste, smilin' up in your face
I'm like trust, never leavin' no trial or no trace
Disappear wit the wind, prostration shows the discipline
Twenty-five years of my life, I learned to miss 'em and

Section,Illadelph Halflife,1996.0,"I came too far to front, I'm comin' with the shots to pump
We got more cuz it's what you want
Thump it in your section and throughout your section
In your area, throughout your whole section, yo
You can't front, I'm comin' with the shots to pump
We got more cuz it's what you want
Thump it in your section and throughout your section
In your area, throughout your whole section

Yo, y'all know the dynasty, The Roots repertoire
The Lieutenant from the reservoir, serve the spar
The injurer, predator of a competitor
I send MCs where the paramedics are
At first, I'm like ""Nah"", I'm nonchalant from afar
Then strike to cut the fake rap star jugular
With irregular balance of the cat burgalar
Known to parlay with Garcia Vega cigars
I know the flavor because me and the thugs minds are mutual
We congruent, lay on the corner with the traum' unit
I'm from the lab where the bomb's distributed
So never try to duplicate the skills executed
Son, you'd get electrocuted from the worldwide reputed
Shine like nickel heat that blow your mind when I shoot it
Some know me as the man that's from The Roots crew
Others as the Bad Lieutenant of Snyder Avenue
We go an eye for an eye
Behead ya like a samurai that'll command the dynasty until he die
Who will imply that I lack abilit-y?
Make your words known, amplify the utilit-y
I'm crooked like the 'I' on a toxic malt liquor
The Land whipper, the Dom Perignon champ sipper
The Fifth'll bring it all together like the zipper on a butter leather
The Bad Lieu'll bring the bad weather
So to whoever got riff, let it rest, reflect
Then recollect on the way it was set
It's the veteran architect that flows with the rhythm of sex
Be on the low, shotgun in the Lex
So with my man, low to flex
I’m restin' where they handle the Tecs
And the lyrical vandal is next the flow
So, my man, my MZA, my man
M-ilitant, what’s the master plan?
Once again…

I came too far to front, I'm comin' with the shots to pump
We got more cuz it's what you want
Thump it in your section and throughout your section
In your area, throughout your whole section, yo

Peep the oratory, niggas bore me with theatrics
Moms listen to they daughter story about my package
The adverse is on your table, stabilize emotion
A soldier at ease, but on post, the utmost and
Brag and boast in my anecdotes that choke
Invade your whole terrain, you feel the pain provoke
When I breaststroke your wavelength of intensity
My alliance bring forth to you an entity
Your whole vicinity, I contaminate with hate
Got no time to debate, but hold up, wait, sit straight
It’s M-Ill, the elicit, you violate, you get a ticket
MCs you can't tell, I expel, you get evicted
From out your misery, serve your ass with my delivery
Allah makes the ground you steppin' on shivery
Permanent tears run through your thoughts, you queers
It's all upstairs, where there's a crowd, table and chairs
For years, been on the mic, I'm like a dyke with stares
When I strike, I stay severe, niggas, they lower their glare
From over here my Range Rover swear to blast off socks
Switch the pitch from southpaw to unorthodox
I shock your brain with the miscellaneous
Who beez the zaniest nigga with words that are spontaneous?

Ayo, the purpose mainly is to generate the Luther Van
Lyrical contraband, controllin' your command and...

You can't front, I'm comin' with the shots to pump
We got more cuz it's what you want
Thump it in your section and throughout your section
In your area, throughout your whole section, yo

All the way live from 2-1-5, all the way live from the 6-1-0
Gettin' cash, get the gusto
One time, it's the dynasty flow
Runnin' it down the line, it's another
Yeah, you in tune to another ill

Raised in the cellar with the rhythm like Ella
Walking mega-trife streets to the subway where I lay
Til the train stop, then a nigga hop (Hop)

Used to smash, crash parties like I was disturbed
Used to make plots against the herringbone herb

I mean, you've been out there, you're on the bandstand, you look out into the audience, what do you see? You see Japanese, you see, you see West Germans, you see, you know, Slabobic, anything except our people - it makes no sense. It incenses me that our own people don't realize our own heritage, our own culture, this is our music

That's bullshit!
BG: Why?
SH: That's all bullshit. Everything, everything you just said is bullshit... You complaining about... I'm talking about the audience. That's right. The people don't come because you grandiose motherfuckers don't play shit that they like. If you played the shit that they liked, then the people would come. Simple as that

The kid drummer, this will cave in your chestplate
It ain't just lines and hooks and fresh bait
Yo the bait hook lines for you all to congregate
Waiting to taste Philly's own fully grown
Rock stone trooper son to the bone the bone
You all done stumbled upon the computer code
Too raw for you to hold, too much to download
It's funny how the murder shit can sound beautiful
Pure trooper soul serious bait
We on some more talk for the hustle and beats to get sold
Move like a body got a mind of its own
Yo, I bang like them sheist niggas out in the cold
That will snatch niggas up right outside of their home
Yet still it's all a quality song, 
, yo everybody get zoned
Because it just ain't real without Roots crew in it
To black people getting money keep doing it
And to whoever will front you know what you can get
Uh get the fuck out of here with that stupid shit

As time goes on, one thing is true
Soul is a treasure, it becomes a part of you
It controls your mind, both you and I
And it feels right, you want action
You're attracted to the big things

Yo I get stopped on the street a lot, people recognize me
Talking stalking walking right behind me
Some of them are genuine fans, some are slimy
Some be coming at me like ""I'm ill nigga, sign me!""
Baiting me I'm waiting for you all to rhyme finely
Ask them to spit, their shit be like common
Nothing I can taste or feel type style
Up inside the studio contaminate the real
See you all make big mistakes for real. I tried to tell them in Clones
You can't sign from the next man's skill
I got style half sex appeal and half trife
My voice is like a soul nigga on a bagpipe
Before we got on stage and got things hype
You was boring the crowd performing the last rites
Now let me show you how this shit is done
It's Black Thought and Questlove on the drum, he the big one
And you about to be the victim, because Mars dog
Murking with the ham and he thirsty to hit son
It ain't nothing but rhymes and ammunition
For all y'all dopes with hopes and ambitions
Of knocking me off and trying to take my position
Stop wishing and sit your ass back and listen
To the yo you rocking with the number one best
No one for contest. Come on, work


Yo I want action baby black cherry Cadillac traction
Smack shit up you won't know what the fuck happened
Thug, you light on the thug and heavy on the passion
In South Philly son there's heavy gun traffic
Yo I got seven joints, every one a classic sound
Down for the long stretch like elastic
Catch this, if I'm in the box selling blast or shot
My thing is pro hip hop and pro blackness
The whole block got straps and throwbacks
But yo sometimes it just contributes to the madness
We live around wild hazards. The bait is
Like a magnet and grown ass kids they want to have it
Their hearts pumping overactive in front of their eyes
It's so elaborate, ghetto melodramatic
Yo I lift it up and come through in the clutch
But y'all came here to do it or what? I keep telling you that
It just ain't real without Roots crew in it
To black people getting money keep doing it

Yo, the feet that I walk with

Yo, the mouth that I talk with
The terror that I stalk with, now it's time to spark shit

Look, ock, I walk around a little edgy already
Y'all MC's come into my face, but my aim's steady
M-Illitant is skilled in most strategic plan
I float across seas and breeze across land
Standing, in these thoughts of murder within
Destructor of this world that's corrupted with sin
I'm always hitting, to leave MC's guessing
For any transgression, in my perimeter
There will be a blessing, and your explicit intoxicated
Buddha session, to stop stressing
Me with the madness, putting niggas on my had list
No sadness is felt, you shuffled and your cards get dealt
Jim Carrey ass niggas start to melt
Impact like a buckle being swung from off a belt
Any help for shelter, when in the realms of a welter
My weight will tilt ya, hold alignments and change your filter
My attitude a product of society
So sometimes for gratitude, you know you can't rely on me
Niggas eyeing me, with looks of they anxiety
Wondering what's in my heart, velocity or piety
Yo, it depends on which one you bring to surface
At times I get trife, but what to worship is my purpose
Malik B blend with the tree, to spot an enemy
You clogging me up, cat, now vacate the vicinity

I'm symbolic to a ballot, it's Abdul Malik
Don't approach with bullshit, I'm quick to call it invalid
Route through your district, we keep it simplistic
No need for the rapper to talk, put it on halt
Show me the vault, or the safe, cause I'm on the paper chase
Wade through route states for bout thirty down my waist
I'm tryna get it, these rain bottling thoughts become acidic
With one in the chamber, ready to aim and spit it
A girlfriend and team made million cash just splintered
I take what you got to give, cause I got to live
The last hour, I bet your ass in rack shower
Might act up, but I still can pass Da'wah
I'm using new ways to try to reach these better days
Instead of tryna take you under, I just make you wonder
I still fast, make salaat and pay zakaat
I didn't make Hajj yet, but that's my next project
Living two lives, one of turn and one with true lies
Keeping up hope, knowing he's answering to my du'as
In the quarters living modest with my nigga Trotter
I circle my foes like a tawaf around the ka'ba
I used to live life like there was no mañana
Now I'm treating every breath like it was Your Honor
I'm Mill-itill-itant with the Fifth that stand firm like a pillar
I'm I and T-L like Manilla

""My man, JD, was a true hip hop artist
... 
I can't explain the influence that
His mind and ear have had on my band
Myself and the careers of so many other
Artists.
 The most humble, modest, worthy
And gifted beatmaker I've known. And
Definitely the best producer on the mic
Never without that signature smile and head
Bouncin' to the beat. JD had a passion for
Life and music, and will never be forgotten
He's a brother that was loved by me, and I
Love what he's done for us. And though I'm
Happy he's no longer in the pain he'd been
Recently feelin', I'm crushed by the pain of
His absence.
 Name's Dilla Dog and I can only
Rep the real and raw. My man, Dilla, rest in
Peace.""

Last of the red hot hip-hop lovin' emcees
That came up on grits and government cheese
The only thing I ever really loved in my life, was a mic
Some of my niggas fell in love with MPs
, come on
Work the bass, nigga, juggle them keys
I'm tryin'a get a piece of this government green
And smack 'em in the melon with another LP
C'mon, help a couple people in the struggle get free
We from the block, where people stay prepared to rock
And it's hard, cause opportunity be scared to knock
And mo' people in the 'hood found dead from cops
Than guns that drop, that sprayed off random shots
But whatcha know good, people say they in the hood fo' good
You ain't a prisoner, the world got mo' to it
Sky's the limit, it don't take but a minute
Don't fear for your people, nigga, my hood yo hood {*echoes*}
Yeah....We did it....

I know in these tryin' times it feels confusin'
That's why I can't tell y'all to dance to the music
Unless, we face it first and try not to lose it
Even if it gets worse, they can't stop this (stop this)

Can't Stop This, I want my peoples to rock this
Bang this music in your speakers and boxes
Langston Hughes is about as a deep as my thoughts is
Sit back and I'mma paint you a portrait
Disgust can make you think that you've lost it
This shit can have you exhausted
Just, picture the planet and imagine it's yours, kid
Don't ever let nobody knock you outta your orbit
I never seen a bridge we couldn't shuffle across it
We got a lotta people livin' a life, that's pure trivia
Real hip hop, and they tryin'a get rid of ya
Can't have that, because here come, the city of Philly
Put an end to all the trivia really
Where I'm walkin' everybody ain't pretty or friendly
It's work, my whole life they ain't give me a penny
Comin' up between a rock and a hard, watchin' for God
People hip hopping with no option at all
Yo ... it's how it's goin' down...

I know in these tryin' times it feels confusin'
That's why I can't tell y'all to dance to the music
Unless, we face it first and try not to lose it
Even if it gets worse, they can't stop this (stop this)

We ripping hearts to pieces parts of raps a special sound
The robe's long enough to be considered a gown
Thought's brim is sharp enough to be considered a crown
When the plate come, take some, pass it around
It's the last of the hip hop lovin' emcees
In front of an audience that never been pleased
I'm comin' from all the streets that never been cleaned
And speakin' for any face that never been seen
This debonair style of my words is high-calibre
Speakin' my mind for every day that's on the calendar
Cause I done been quiet, about as long as I can handle it
Walked a mile in these boots that I'm standin' in
Mellow soul brother with his lyrical dean on
The stages I'm seen on, mic I fiend on
When a song full of soul, that's when it mean more
I never hesitate to give a shoulder to lean on, yo
... Check it out, man

I know in these tryin' times it feels confusin'
That's why I can't tell y'all to dance to the music
Unless, we face it first and try not to lose it
Even if it gets worse, they can't stop this (stop this)

Maybe or maybe not, I admit what I committed
Exhibit the truth because I'm livin' proof why
I had no disguise tryin' to vocalize

Dig it, look into the window, tell me what you see?
The M-illitant school of philosophy
When niggas get dealt wit mental velocity
Connect my sentences and thoughts like apostrophes
You represent hypocrisy, it ain't no stoppin' me
Until I fulfill the term of my prophecy
My attitude is scarred by this inner-city urban
Iller dolo stress on my brain just like a turban
Who get grazed by the bullet? Triggers, who's quick to pull it?
The anti-bullshitter, Islamic extortioner
You're the forfeiter unfortunately
Niggas who wanna gyp me, I cause humidity, so come and get me
I'm simply the cat to lay back, I chill and watch you
The silent ninja intends to injure, now I gotchu
Sanity was lost so now I'm found insane
I'm thinkin' streets to jeeps; hours, days, to weeks
I even speak to geeks, I hold my fortune, it's sweet
I'm discreet in the streets, but that's just the way I play, though
I lay low, but over your head just like a halo
Hell's angel, these thoughts you cannot untangle

Situatin' me at the top of the pile
Wild Delaware Val', Pennsylvanian sub-terranean style
Step up into my crevice and taste the medicine of the 
champagne
King like Evelyn,
 leavin' you leveled and sabotaged
It's all camouflage like the devil and guns
And coke peddlin', Olympic meddlin' flashback
That of a war veteran blast at
The programmer bringin' lashes 'cross your back
On some accuracy of a brainwashed Bosnian troop
That swooped down through your roof without sound
On a lyrical Nat Turner mission, reactin' off of intuition
Continuously alert, no intermission
If your ears hurt, you shouldn't listen
That means you're artificial and my style'll poison your brain tissue
Gettin' maimed and crippled once the gamma rays hit you
Migraine's habitual and I should never go against
The ritual I've been masterin' ever since
I was among the flavored youth, remain sharper than a saber tooth
My deliverance is self-evidence
Vit-al, lyric-al science (now)

If you seen it or heard it, maybe, probably I did it
Maybe or maybe not, I admit what I committed
Exhibit the truth because I'm livin' proof why
I had no disguise, no verdicts, no alibis

Who knows what you snorted?
Or who support what you recorded?
But don't get it distorted, in this orbit you're aborted
This authentic, sorted shit's imported, exported
Styles, they get sported, 
my paragraph's aortic
Behold, the illest medley lock you in a choke hold
Illadelph epilogue, top league, plush, plus en vogue
Slice tongues from your area code
Student of life that's on the rugged, exterior mode
Blind a devil with the bold, black and gold shine
I walk the thin line and hold mine, let the people respond
It's mind detect mind, swine decline, let the power refine
Build like it's 1999
In this day and time, the reptilian roams the sextillion tons
Your Armageddon gwan come from the sun
Untouchable cuts that's unclutchable for some to overstand
So y'all sit back and wonder ""Damn!""

It wasn't really that ill until the start of crack
Now, it's a body caught every night on the Almanac
Rock bottom, where them cops got a problem at
Where them outsiders getting popped for they wallet at
I had nothing, but I made something out of that
Now, I'm the first out the limo like Charlie Mack
From 2-1-5, it's him, the livest one
And he's representing Philly to the fullest
Black's the realest, you can't touch him
And not for nothing, if you 'bout hip-hop, then you gots to love it
If not, then, fuck it, I'm still handling
Smoking more reefer than Redman and 'em
Damaging MCs, and my name—'Riq, geez
You endangered species
For what I do, I'm 'bout to up the fees, I'm paper chase-motivated
I ain't the one to play with, these cats get set ablaze
You can have it y'all way, but I'd rather parlay
Just smoke O.G. and get cabbage all day

When Black step in the door all hats is off
Your hands up in the air going back and forth

I'll make it hotter than when Shaft in Africa
Jump out a black Porshe huffing a fat cigar
Night-riding on 'em like my last name Hasselhoff
Voted unlikely to succeed 'cause my class was full
Of naysayers, cheaters and thieves
All it gave me was a good enough reason to leave
And put the writing on the wall for y'all to read it and weep

Dumb and blind...

They say a record ain't nothing if it's not touching, gripping
Draw you in closer, make you want to listen to it
And if you real ill at making music
The listener feel like he livin' through it, that's how my nigga do it
I met Slacks back in like, '91, rapping
We went to Millersville to get away from gun clappin'
It ain't last, I be in class dreaming 'bout
50,000 fans up in the stands screaming out
""Encore!"" Yo, I'm headed back to Philly
Nigga you rollin' with me? I'm trying to get busy
We walked dogs that was off the chain
Lot of times, at the shows, people hardly came
I just took it in stride as part of the game
But inside people down with me started to change
It was a couple things, lil' syrup, lil' pills
Instead of riding out on the road you'd rather chill
I know the way a pleasure feel, I'm not judging
But still I'm on a mission, yo, I'm not buggin'
I got fam that can't stop druggin', they can't sleep
They can't stick to one subject, they can't eat
It's people steady comin' at me out in the street
Like 'Riq, yo, what up with your peeps? It gets deep, nigga

Yo, you need to walk straight, master your high
Son you missin' out on was passing you by
I done seen the streets suck a lot of cats dry
But not you and I, my nigga, we got to get
Come on, over, over the water
Come on, over, over the water
Water, water...

Yo, we done been through many meals, a couple of deals
We done shared clothes and wheels, killed mics and reels
We done rocked shows abroad and slept on floors
Trying to figure what the fuck we gettin' slept on for
Or what we walking with the weapon for
Weighted by the gravity law, you'd know it if you came up poor, my nigga
Picture the bus up north, you know we made
Of everything outlaws are made of, I'm far from a hater
And I don't say I love you 'cause the way I feel is greater
And M-Ila, you a poet, son, you a born creator
And this'll probably dawn on you later, it's in your nature
Lyrics all on your walls like they made of paper
You got to find out where your talent take you
You might fuck around, finally make it, and that's real but, yo

Yo, you need to walk straight, master your high
Son you missin' out on was passing you by

But not you and I my nigga, we got to get

Come on, over, over the water

Yo, I want you all to understand I come from South Philly
And when I walk the street it's like a pharmacy
They got all type of shit anybody could get
It goes from H to X to loosie cigarettes
For my ghetto legend known for lil' sheist runnin'
Copped codeine by the quarts and keep comin'
Dumbin, just embracing the dope like it's a woman
You burnin' both sides of the rope and just pullin'
Tuggin', in between Islam and straight thuggin'
Laying everyday around the way and doin' nothin'
See'em looking shaking their head and start shruggin'
If they don't got a man like mine, they got a cousin
Ayo, you better be a true friend to him
Before the shit put an end to 'em, or give a pen to him
Or lock him in the studio with a mic
'Cause on the real, it might save his life
Keep tellin' 'em!

Yo, you need to walk straight, master your high
Son you missin' out on was passing you by
I done seen the streets suck a lot of cats dry
But not you and I my nigga, we got to get
Come on, over, over the water
Come on, over, over the water
Water, water...
Yo, you need to walk straight, master your high

Silent Treatment,Do You Want More?!!!??!,1995.0,"Girl, you know that you need
To stop giving me the silent.. treatment baby
Can't you see what you mean to me?
I wanna love you constantly, but you keep neglecting me
And treating me silently
Girl, you know that you need
To stop giving me the silent.. treatment baby
Can't you see what you mean to me?
I wanna love you constantly, but you keep neglecting me
And treating me silently

Yo, I had a queen named Amina, height 5'7""
Caramel-complected, body like heaven
Met her through the sister of my man, Big Vince
Like something from out the flicks we been in love ever since
She called me her chocolate brother, I call her my sugar sister
Knew Shorty could work it since before I ever kissed her
I never dissed her, painted my picture to hit
But because sex she wasn't with, she started flipping and shit
Like, ""Listen man, I'm Queen Amina, Amina's not no freak and
That game is weak and keep trying to hit I could quit speaking
Tariq in fact, you bein Black Thought don't get you closer
I dig ya but won't bone ya because I'm so-called supposed to
Most o' them would, but that couldn't be me, that's not my flavor
Go home and think about that, maybe later on I'll page ya""
I contemplated, and then concluded she was bluffing
Steady pursuing screwing, getting nothing but the silent treatment

Girl you know that you need
To stop giving me the silent.. treatment baby
Can't you see what you mean to me?
I wanna love you constantly, but you keep neglecting me
And treating me silently

Crazy frustration, about my loving situation
When patience was a virtue, but I wasn't used to waiting
I want some Marvin Gaye healing, feeling is real inside
I slip and slide, my ride'll keep you occupied, I'd
Love to get with it like that, but my baby's kitty cat's capped
And locked, Love Boat is docked at the shore
And what for? Later for groupies on tour
Why won't my sugar call me no more?
I mean, my queen gets upset, rejectin and sexually neglect
Then sayin I'm more sewer than Das EFX, and closed-minded
It's like I'm blinded by the skinning
I'm into women; because of that, this one's into
Communication, temptation played the vandal
Freaking my brain, my mind ripping the handle on physically scandalous
Acts, yo, she knew what I wanted, but she fronted
(Bust it)

Girl, you know that you need
To stop giving me the silent.. treatment baby
Can't you see what you mean to me?
I wanna love you constantly, but you keep neglecting me
And treating me silently

Well umm
Moving right along with the song, plus the strong
Feelings on my mind, desire to intertwine
Combine and blend, baby bust a message that I send
Ain't no need to pretend, cause shit is real 'til the end
I provide a place to hide from crime, hard times
And living trife, while I open your mind, you're in my life
Like love, it ain't no way no one can rise above
What's real, that's why I'm feeling like you're making me bugged
I puff an El on fifty deuce while I walk in the rain
Heart feeling killer pain while I hop the train
Dial her number to the rest, and ain't no messages left
Regardless, my chest thumps from stress, yo it's a mess
I don't know what I got to do to make you understand
I'm for real and that's no question, no fronting or no guessing
Undressing, caressing, in the span, that I contain in my hand
Could touch and make you say that I'm such a man
And call my name, so let me set your body aflame
I'll never treat you like a dame or run game
Now who's to blame?
I know you're not a ho for niggas with a lot of dough
But I just wanted you to know

Girl, you know that you need
To stop giving me the silent.. treatment baby
Can't you see what you mean to me?
I wanna love you constantly, but you keep neglecting me
And treating me silently
Girl, you know that you need
To stop giving me the silent.. treatment baby
Can't you see what you mean to me?

Black Rock,…and then you shoot your cousin,2014.0,"Black rock

Yo, what's for breakfast? Same as yesterday
Oh, that's right, cheeseburger and a 40 ounce
Then what's for dinner? Nothing, nigga
But last night I had dreams of a porterhouse
For real, for real, I feel like cattle in a slaughterhouse
But fuck that, roll one up, yo, here's a quarter ounce
It ain't no hydro, but it gets you high though
Them niggas look like cops but what the fuck do I know?

And at the end of this tunnel, it's red and blue lights
Guess you pay the price when you never do right
One thing I know, all I did is wrong
Maybe there ain't nowhere I belong
The only thing in front of me's a bullet in the head
They hoping one day that they find me dead
'Til then I make a place in this world
For me and my baby girl (Yeah, yeah!)

Yo, the dead drop way until the AM
Mumbo jumbo niggas, onomatopoeian
Call it how I see them, ain't no rhyme or reason
I'm on some different bullshit everyday just like per diem
Out of bandwidth, animal anguish
So love no bitch, die rich is the language
Guilty as sin, depending on a reed shaking in the wind
Just a question never answered out here looking for its end

And at the end of this tunnel, it's red and blue lights
Guess you pay the price when you never do right
One thing I know, all I did is wrong

Vampire chicks suck blood, dusk to dawn and
Waitin to catch me sleep but I'm not yawnin

Girl, it's you that I adore
Step off stage and scream for more
All I see, pussy galore
Snap my fingers, make you mine
If not, I'll snap a second time
After that, I guarantee
You will be standing next to me

Yo, my old head once said, it's more powerful than cocaine
Freaks dancin' in a line like Soul Train
To get your pride up, that extra push
Niggas lookin' for the time of their life, coppin' a rush
Yo I know sis', dawg, her name Lorraine
She's a thick brick house with a chocolate frame
I went to school with her
Twelfth grade, I used to fool with her
She put me on with her squad, I got cool with her
She used to say she wanted to be a doctor
And couldn't nothin' stop her
From gettin' up that cash
For tuition, even if she had to shake that ass
Fucked up, her money ain't accumulate that fast
Lorraine know it's real, and sex controls America
Turn the TV on, it's in the open on the regular, yo
What the freaks in the video for?
Fuck a song, gimme a thong, and pussy galore

You see, life is about marketing pussy galore
Every time I turn around, there's more pussy galore
Nations going to war for the pussy galore
Either the cash, the raw, or the pussy galore
Yo, gang wars, more pussy galore
From the screen to the record store, pussy galore
Every time I turn around, there's more pussy galore
Either the cash, the raw, or the pussy galore

Yo, desire and lust can make a man kill
Or jump off the bridge, cuffed to a motherfuckin' anvil
So it's promoted like it's all y'all know
Keep a nigga under the spell, you under control
But yo, I seen it make people slit they wrists
Weakness, pussy make a spy say secrets
But what for? Cause sex is the law
And been many an empire rise and fall
From the squares to the players
To the pimps to the whores
To big checks that never would have been endorsed
Ya know, I sit back and just peep thangs
9 outta 10, it's the same songs, only the beat change
So don't be lookin' at Tariq strange
When I conduct a little Litmus test up in your heat range
That's when you see me up on stage with six
Wicked ass chicks fittin to get crunk with this

Life is about marketing pussy galore
Every time I turn around, there's more pussy galore
Corporations going to war over the pussy galore
Either the cash, the raw, or the pussy galore
Yo, gang wars, more pussy galore
From the screen to the record stores, pussy galore
Every time I turn around, there's more pussy galore
Every time I turn around, there's more pussy galore

Yo, fresh cut, with the thick black velour
With the black Louis sneaks, headed out for tour
Lookin' out the limo window up at the billboards
200 miles, she was the only thing I saw
Promotin' everything, from the liquor to the nicotine
Cell phones, anti-histamines, chicken wings
You gotta show a little skin to get them listening
For real yo, the world is a sex machine
Full of pretty freaks in designer jeans
That go to extremes to conjure all kinds of schemes
Half the time, it ain't even responsibly
Tryin' to take me some place I'm not tryin to be
Ghetto, Sin City, where the P is free
You catch a bid far worser than a 1 to 3
All up in the after-hours on the second floor
For that good thing, that keep 'em comin' back for more, ya heard me

It's about marketing the pussy galore
Every time I turn around, there's more pussy galore
Nations going to war for the pussy galore
Either the cash, the raw, or the pussy galore
Dig it, gang wars, more pussy galore
From the screen to the record store, pussy galore
Either the cash, the raw, or the pussy galore
More pussy galore, more pussy galore

Distortion to Static,Do You Want More?!!!??!,1994.0,"(Laughter)

Yo, I'm every MC, it's all in me
That's the way it is, the way it's gotta be
Indeed as I distort, I proceed, indeed
Getting hotter than sacks of boom in my room at the Ramada
For tanks in your memory banks to fill up
I provide the static, a scratch to match, while you catch the vibe
Most can play high-post, but yo, that don't mean shit
Because my clique will make a motherfucker sick
I'll flips, redder than pork, comin' to New York to mix
(It's Bob Power) With the snares and kicks to fix
Rhythmically, you got ta be, static-y
Magically I appear, spark a L and drink a beer
With Air Smooth, takin' niggas loot with dice
Then shoot, The Roots, poetic, courageously kinetic
Vagabond, versatile and various, trust rap styles
Of mine are blunt, pain is in the mind, so I'm fine and five
Foot seven, inches in height
My mission to strike mics, enlightening tykes
Frightening, like lightning
Fluorescent, incandescent, effervescently
I represent, Foreign Objects and Ill Elements
Very relevant, plus intelligently managin' matter
That's makin' tracks fatter, revolve around
Saturn like rings and brings swings, when I stings with bass
Then distort up in your face like mace
Bustin' your dreams like gats with loaded magazines
I'm on the rap scene, repellin' fellas like a vaccine
As I, rocks from under, blunderin' I'm not, lyrically
Ya get, shot, get caught, so distort with Thought, for real
It's the illest out the Phi, short for Philidelph-iada-fly
Money makin', move fakin', I isn't
Niggas can not front, I'm poetically exquisite
Wicked, with the visit while you're wonderin', what is it?
Dig it, yo, my mellow, um, what up for the night?
(Malik B., get on the mic, get on the mic)
Like that y'all, and yo, I'm flowin', my part of the song
It's goin', it's goin', it's gone

(Laughter)

Now, go get your dictionary and your Pictionary
'Cause much affliction with my diction friction slips and carries
Words and herds like some cattle in the steeple
People, there's no equal, or no sequel
So policies of equalities get abolished
Demolished, distortion of the static's gettin' polished
Urges of splurgin' words will just be merged together
Damn, it's quite clever, however
You never can sound alike, lyrics don't be poundin' like
These, troops, who be's, Roots
Insult ya, mellow by culture, rhythmatic vulture
Approach ya with Magnetic shit that's Ultra
I make MC's dangle like a bangle, strangle from every angle
My lingo jingles and it jangles under Kangols
Nahh, them niggas don't wanna tangle
'Cause Roots get loose, negros get juiced like the mango
To be particular, extra-curricular, for pleasure
Measure, in any weather, value more than the treasure
Baby, you're sayin' maybe, then comin' to flex
Now you wonder what's next

Don't feel it, don't feel it, can't feel it no more
Seems to me nowadays things have changed
I don't know if I feel the same

Yo, in the land of the unseen hand that holds trouble
Theorize your game, it's difficult to roll a double
The struggle ain't right up in your face, it's more subtle
But it's still coming across like the bridge and tunnel vision
I try to school these bucks, but they don't wanna listen
That's the reason the system making this paper from the prison
And that's the reason we living where they don't wanna visit
Where the dope slanging, keep swangin' like Sonny Liston
The money missing and there's mouths to feed
Get the brain kicking, thinking of a thousand things
Remember back in the days, when the kitchen had eggs
And pancakes, chicken and greens and Kool Aid?
When the refrigerator naked and the cupboard is bare
People got to strip naked, stick 'em up in the air
Was it lies when they told you wasn't nothing to fear?

And when I'm writing my thoughts out, really, I'm boxing
My main adversary any silly concoction
Freeze your face like botulinum toxin
If you ain't trying to get popped, then give me a option
Helicopters chopping from Philly to Compton
The Jones, the Richardsons, the Smiths and the Johnsons
If you ain't saying nothing, you the system's accomplice
It should play with your conscience, do away with the nonsense
I'm overseeing anything within my circumference
This ain't a press junket, I ain't seeking responses
I stand where the people got the heat in they pockets
You mesmerized by the calm nonchalantness
I spin a dark web on some John Hitchcock shit
If you ain't speaking your life, your rhyme's adopted
If it don't feel right, then stop it, you know what I'm saying?

It don't feel right, it don't feel right
Don't feel it, don't feel it, can't feel it no more

Yo, children working, weapon-producing
Natural disaster got the planet in a panic
We all got to make that living
Sex, drugs, murder, politics and religion
Forms of hustling, watch who you put all your trust in
Worldwide, we coincide with who suffering
Who never had shit and ain't got nothing
But more struggling, it makes you wanna run up in the motherfuckin'
Hot zone for a piece of the cake back
I can't work for it, I can certainly take that
I'm fired up, thinking about the payback, ASAP
You fuck around, be a enemy of the state, black
Ill, but that's too real for TV

I guess you probably a thug, you boss ballin' or what?

Criminal,Rising Down,2008.0,"And Monday, they predict the storm
Tuesday, they predict the bang
Wednesday, they cover the crash
And I can see it's all about cash
And they got the nerve to hunt down my ass
And treat me like a criminal

Look, it is what it is because of what it was
I did what I did cause it does what it does
I don't put nothing above what I am, what I love
My family, my blood, my city and my hood
Hater for the greater good, I'm back from Hollywood
And I ain't changed a lick, though I know I probably should
But what I'm doing is not a good look
I never did it by the good book as a lifetime crook
All the petty crime took a toll on me
I look around at my homies that's getting old on me
But still something got a hold on me, maybe it's fate
If it's coming, yo, I'm willing to wait, I'm not running
I done ran through the muck, I done scrambled and such
I done robbed an odd jobbed and gambled enough
Until I'm put up in handcuffs and pissing in a cup
If there's a God, I don't know if he listening or what

And Monday, they predict the storm
Tuesday, they predict the bang
Wednesday, they cover the crash
And I can see it's all about cash
And they got the nerve to hunt down my ass
And treat me like a criminal

Yeah, it is what it is, and that's how it go
Get treated like a criminal if crime is all you know
Get greeted like a nigga if a nigga's all you show
A public enemy that's in the eye of the scope
My city like a island where you can't find a boat
Have you wishing for a raft and praying that hope floats
Some real ethnic cleansing going down, no soap
Who looking for a chair and some real strong rope
Just to end it all here, screaming, ""Fuck the mayor""
He see the faces at the bottom of the well clear
They act like I'm something to fear, trapped in urban warfare
Putting triggers 'head a college career
Can't ignore the call of the wild, that's drawing them near
Try to make fast money last long some years
Try to laugh it off, still couldn't lose the tears
To the rules, I will not adhere, break the law, yeah

And Monday, they predict the storm
Tuesday, they predict the bang
Wednesday, they cover the crash
And I can see it's all about cash
And they got the nerve to hunt down my ass
(And do what?) And treat me like a criminal

Who want to challenge mine? I'm sick of St. Valentine
I did the violent crimes, that's why I got this style of rhyme
Seek repentance to spitting them sentences that's senseless
Experience is the difference, you can't convince this
In a crime sense, niggas is infants
I'm like a senior citizen, still living but getting benefits
Put emphasis on hitting my nemesis in high percentages
Crooked ass cops is the reason for my belligerence
And it gets deeper than that, 'member nights I used to sleep with a gat
With a package of crack under my sneaker strap
D's sneak attack, arraign me, it took a week for that
Beat the rap, but you're saying ""Look, he think he the mack""
Fuck y'all, niggas who thinking they might try us
Watch us insight riots, flip cars and light fires
We already been knocked, scrutinized
Plus cops rush to brutalize us, America is polluted by lust
Who could I trust? If I can't trust you, then I might touch you
If I ain't got love for you then fuck you

And Monday, they predict the storm
Tuesday, they predict the bang
Wednesday, they cover the crash
And I can see it's all about cash
And they got the nerve to hunt down my ass
And treat me like a criminal
And Monday, they predict the storm
Tuesday, they predict the bang
Wednesday, they cover the crash
And I can see it's all about cash
And they got the nerve to hunt down my ass
And treat me like a criminal",https://genius.com/The-roots-criminal-lyrics
Champion,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Success in life comes when you simply refuse to give up
On a mission so strong that obstacles like failure and loss only act as motivation
I mean like, no one has the power to shatter your dreams unless you give it to them

When something's telling me to stop, I never do that in the name of love
Until I've given it my all and it just ain't enough
See even if it's getting realer than they say it was
Straighten up, who's afraid of what? Player get involved
Nah, you work hard 'til you're better off
24/7, 365, never off
Look at me, I'm nocturnal, I don't sleep
My eyes heavy, bags and crow's feet
But I won't be stopped I go from tragedy to majesty
The victory has been woven into my tapestry
My adversary's not cut from the same flag as me
That's why the champion's gonna be who it has be
This ain't the type of opportunity that just appeared
I made it here because I shed blood sweat and tears
Forget the title, I forever have my sights on
This is where I become an American Icon

If you a champion, show me you a champion
If you a champion, show me you a champion
Cause real champions move like champions
And real champions prove that they're champions
If you a champion, show me you a champion
If you a champion, show me you a champion
Cause real champions move like champions
And real champions prove that they're champions

Listen, forward motion never fail
I learn to hustle, it's part of a cautionary tail
Hard work is something I know very well
A lesson in a blessing out of each and every L, I ball
I fell in love with the game and never look back
My foundation and frame, they never shook that
Been trailblazing my name into the book that
Represent all the champs who had a chance and took that
And laser focus is the reoccurring theme
Forever coming to me like a reoccurring dream
If we weren't kings, we'd probably be swimming up stream
Tryna make the devil come clean for the umpteenth
You know me as the global dean from the noble team
So convene and the whole regime shall be overseen
I'm a pillar like a column in the Pantheon
Competition I can't see 'em, I'm champion

If you a champion, show me you a champion
If you a champion, show me you a champion
Cause real champions move like champions
And real champions prove that they're champions
If you a champion, show me you a champion
If you a champion, show me you a champion
Cause real champions move like champions
And real champions prove that they're champions

I'm gon' prove that I'm the champion
And if there's something I can't do, then it can't be done
And I ain't saying I don't lose, I'm saying I'm the only one
And if it's either I or you, you best believe there's only gon' be one...true champion

If you a champion, show me you a champion
If you a champion, show me you a champion
Cause real champions move like champions
And real champions prove that they're champions
If you a champion, show me you a champion
If you a champion, show me you a champion
Cause real champions move like champions
And real champions prove that they're champions
If you a champion, show me you a champion
If you a champion, show me you a champion
Cause real champions move like champions
And real champions prove that they're champions
If you a champion, show me you a champion
If you a champion, show me you a champion

Concerto of The Desperado,Illadelph Halflife,1996.0,"It's the Concerto of The Desperado
R-double-O-T-S, check the flow
If you know like I know, then you know the motto
That's all the fraud/fake shit gots to go

Yo, in the glow of the moon, over the melancholy metro
My poetry is set like a U.F.O
The maestro, the lyricist concerto
My physical play the role of a vessel
The level of my lyrics law manifesto
My thoughts wrestle and attack with the killer instincts
Of a gorilla stronger than Samson
Without Delilah, my soliloquy profess my ability to just
Stimulate you like the best sensimilla
The Halflife of Illadel' LP, no filler, proceed
Hitherin' is my death, I will blow your tower to smithe-
-reens, the fiends catch another rhyme river
Deeper than the meditations of a Hindu worshiper
Unorthodox hip-hop minister
Than a Serengeti cheetah, my thought's swifter
You lose your balance when the sound hits ya
So, check for the Fifth Militia
A poet's under pressure, stressin' that you get the picture (Click!)
Even if it mean you gotta hang over the banister
I pull a microphone on any pistol brandisher
And take advantage of ya crew because you're amateur
Styles gunnin' down your sound-man and manager, what!?
This how we do it in the year of '96
With this deliberate attack on pointless rap shit
Breakin' MC's down to fraction, tell your squadron
It's time to go to war, Respond/React once more

It's the Concerto of The Desperado
R-double-O-T-S, check the flow
If you know like I know, then you know the motto

It's the Concerto of The Desperado
R-double-O-T-S, check the flow
If you know like I know, then you know the motto
That's all the fraud/fake shit gots to go

The implorer, the universe explorer
Treat MC's like the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah
Leavin' these niggas open like the box of Pandora
With styles that's Newer than the World Order
Approximately 3/4 of y'all are water, I straight deport ya
Then orchestrate your torture with roots of culture
The pil-grimage to the line of scrimmage up against your image
Where life is a heist and the strong get a percentage
It's ill as a war and within it, I'm the Lieutenant
That surrounds you like a peninsula to snatch the pennant
You fold like Japan's futons and fans
While I design a plan to make a rapper step like a pedestri-an
I crush a mount-ain into grains of sand
Your pain stains the hand that held the mic inserted to the stand
The Desperado that refuse to follow
The Fifth aficionado break you up into parts like vibrato
I'm deep like the dark of the night
Niggas is sweet and sound silly when they talk on the mic
They use the simple back-and-forth
The same old rhythm that's plain
I'd rather UltraMagnetize your brain
It's the hip-hop purist
That leave you lost like a tourist inside the chorus
Niggas is bringin' nothin' for us
As we're breakin' 'em down to fraction, tell your squadron
It's time to go to war, Respond/React once more

What You Want,The Roots Come Alive,1999.0,"Here's what you want right
Here's what you need right
We got to give you more
Of what you're looking for
So it's a secret that's been pent up inside for years
Exclusive type, only for your eyes and ears
You held it in for so long you bursted into tears
The letters spilled slowly across the page like a world premiere
Well I ain't, the bullshit begins here
The obvious cause, the effects is unclear
The punishment for crimes of the heart could be severe
Though to keep it on the low is a heavy cross to bear
You deep now, submerged with no signs of air
Still your sunken heart thumpin like the kick in a snare
While on the surface it's all turnin to a circus
That's why you're nervous, and you got a right to be
Cause if somebody would've done that shit to me
I mean my best man hittin my wife-to-be
My sentiments exactly would be history
Y'know what I'm sayin? My peoples in the place let's hit it off, one two

Yo, it's like nothing changed, it's all the same thing
The same characters in a book, with different names
It's a lot more to lose than you got to gain
You a lot more confused than hip to the game
The peep the script of the game the price is pain
Men and women get into things, now who's to blame?
When everybody whispering bout whatever took place
And how the fact twist a knot with a straight face
And lies, hard to swallow from the bitter taste
Well that's a point in the past that can't be erased
So motivate, though it's hard to let it ride
Or set aside true feelings, underhand dealings
Our lost trust, I wonder if we lost us
It's bigger than me and you, it's monstrous
So I'ma, just calm down and try to relax
Before I clap the hammer ???? , one two

If you could only flash back and undo our actions
Change what happens, dissect the fractions
A time to rewind and be recorded absent
For real cause these memories is photographic
Pornographic, pushing me close to madness
Head heavy like I'm tripping on acid tablets
Yesterday as I recall was all fabulous I thought so
But now it feel like shots hittin' my torso
Spent a lot of time and trust in the wrong place
Fought a lot of fights rolling with the wrong ace
Love, stronger than pride, we could end disgrace
I need, room to think, and space to ventilate
Was solid as a rock, shall not disintegrate
Thoughts racing like the lunatics on the interstate
For real, ya, it's ill, ya, my peoples in the place...",https://genius.com/The-roots-what-you-want-lyrics
Thought @ Work,Phrenology,2002.0,"Yo, where the freaks at? Lookin' at me
You wanna see Black? Then jump on it
And to the chumps who think they might want it
I might spot your ride and dump on it
And send a couple of boys to that corner of yours
And role out with a nigga slumped on it
You see Black fall back son
Me and Shock up in a black Regal no insurance
We like DEA serving warrants
So tell the freaks you know to stop whorin
We gon' grab the mics and get 'em off the wall
So e'rybody in here can stop snorin
Yo where the safe Money unlock it, pull it out your pocket
Ben Banniker Bay with the Al Morrocan
Black Thought on capitals like the sovereign
Girls get your eyes back up out the sockets
Focus, flawless. New York to Europe
To lands where my feet ain't even touch the soil yet
What a movement, the rap solution
It thumps so hard we got 'em world wide usin them
Tracks from Black for satisfaction
The role of captain played by Samuel L. Jackson
Yo ill insanity that's cold and morbid
But when I'm in your orbit you soul absorb it
A real raw nigga won't fold or forfeit
A thorough bred gonna enforce it
Tariq's where the beats at
And where the people out their seats at
For what? Cause y'all on it
I'm like Aqua man and Brown Hornet
I'm like Imhotep but don't flaunt it
Dog, reintroducing master thespian
Ho-telling-est, elin-est, emceein
Fuck getting money for real, get freedom
Black on the grind from AM to the PM
Splash up, crash up the X-5 B.M
Motive entertainment the philly mob we in
Weak hearts, yo we not them
Waddup nigga T3 nigga Baatin
When the M-Ill get home we're gonna win
First thing to fall is cats with no chin
The mic the black hold remain smokin'
And ladies up in the place is wide open
For real you know what I'm talking about
Pull it out your pocket, pull it out your pocket
Pull it out your pocket, check it out

You feel this shit soon as they throw it on
You feel this joint this is your new favorite song
You at the dancehall, you got it going on
It's time to show it off so throw your hands up
Check it out yo
You feel this shit soon as they throw it on
You feel this joint this is your new favorite song
You at the dancehall, you got it going on
It's time to show it off yall niggas know whats up

Yo here go the rapper of the year, year of the rap
Come from South Philly where the hammers are clapped huh?
Violate and you will answer to Black
You a thug not really there's the answer to that
Lee ya, boxed silly with the hands skill attack
Cancel your check flip, dismantle your trap huh?
Wanna pack can't handle your strap
You a schmuck type, shoot your man in the back
Meanwhile I'm outstanding and I'm outspoken
Wild out take fools out without joking
If I run out of shots I'm going out poking
On a date with sis we going out stroking
And the shot is fantastic
The fantastic is the romantic
And to the freaks in the house if you're ready to bounce
We can go to the flat then get tantric
Yeah. you pronounce the name Tariq, any questions?
Street hip-hop I bring forth the essence
You see us pulling up five deep
With nothing but dimes inside of my jeep
I'm not arguing to get in VIP cocksucker prick
Suck a dick I'mma floss for the fuck of it
Girls say the baw Black be on some other shit
Nigga talk like you work for the government
My words birthed like Barnes & Noble
Spit hot flames that'll harm your vocal
Spit thought name I'm a bomb your local
Neighborness, for a ten mile radius
Well every ghetto craving this new anthem
My brain unstable and I'm just too handsome
I bang with the best around
Who can test the crown when I finesse the sound
Here come the controller

You feel this shit soon as they throw it on
You feel this joint this is your new favorite song
You at the dancehall, you got it going on
It's time to show it off so throw your hands up
Check it out yo

I'm somethin' from his worst dreams
First we handlin' first things, I'm subsurface unseen
Grat'll hold planet by purse strings
MC's are earthlings, not built to hurt things
Speakin' the words of weaklings, nothin' but sweet things

Man each world, it ain't no time to recline
Act up, get clapped up, my mind is the nine
Shine like jewels that spark, swimmin' with sharks
Never caught speakin' to NARC's, that's weak in the parks
I'm the type to sit back and analyze the prize
Grip it up and flee the scene wit' a different disguise
Take a detour, I be all that I can be, whore
Talkin' to this *bitch* life, had to make her my wife
Live twice, got seven more lives to live
I'm all out, takin' things to the fullest extent
Help me get it down and we can split 100%
Run a rapper through a maze like an experiment

Get off your horse and on your P's and beware

Niggas price bricks till dawn, if the money is long
Cats who play strong will inhale, then go play bong
You wrong, son, if you thought I wasn't droppin' a ton
Sit and think about the way I wanna tally a sum

Aiyyo, I sneakfully snuck up from behind and got you
From over there in them bushes, I chilled and watched you
Dancin' all jolly as you pussy for them folly
I knock you out wit' one punch

In the Music,Game Theory,2006.0,"I'm from the illest part of the Western Hemisphere
So, if you into sight seein', don't visit there
It's somewhere between Jersey and Delaware
Philly never scared and them niggas ain't timid there
Them young triggers lose lives by the minute there
It might start but the fight never finish there
They all fucked up tryna get the gingerbread
A few stacks be the price for a nigga head
Cops and robbers, cowboys and Indians
Clips and revolvers and George's and Benjamin's
A celebration of the loss of your innocence
To your old self, you've lost any resemblance
They say the city make a dark impression
The youth just lost and they want direction
But they don't get the police, they get the protection
And walk around with heat like Charlton Heston, man

It's in the music, turn it up let it knock

They don't want no problems, what are y'all stupid

It's colder than the North Pole, livin' unlawful
I'm givin' you a jawful of somethin' awful

I spit flames and get dames to get change
With pitbull bark and lock the shock
Don't bother me, Ahk, don't you dare lie to me, Ahk
I don't know who this nigga that you try to be, Ahk
Benefit of doubt had me think you in it for clout
Big shit, send it for route and finish him out
Joints stiff from rigor mortis, while we swimmin' in waters
Women with daughters will have us niggas sinnin' with orders

It's in the music, turn it up let it knock
Let it bang on the block 'til the neighbors call the cops
The cops gone come but they ain't gone do shit
They don't want no problems, what are y'all stupid

Knocked up 9 months ago
And what she finna have she don't know
She want neo-soul, this hip-hop is old
She don't want no rock-n-roll
She want platinum or ice or gold
She want a whole lotta somethin' to fold
If you a obstacle she just drop ya cold
Cuz one monkey don't stop the show
Little Mary is bad
In these streets she done ran
E'er since when the heat began
I told the girl look here
Calm down I'ma hold your hand
To enable you to peep the plan
Cuz you is quick to learn
And we can make money to burn
If you allow me the latest game
I don't ask for much, but enough room to spread my wings
And the world finna know my name
(Verse 2: Cody Chesnutt)
I don't ask, for much these days
And I don't bitch, and whine, if I don't get my way
I only wanna fuck another behind my lover's back
I sit and watch it grow standin' where I'm at
Fertilize another behind my lover's back
And I'm keepin' my secrets mine
I push my seed in her bush for life
Its gonna work because I'm pushin' it right
If Mary drops my baby girl tonight
I would name her Rock-N-Roll

Uh-huh
Cadillac need space to roam
Where we headin for she don't know
We in the city where the pros shake rattle and roll
And I'm a gaddang rollin' stone
I don't beg I can hold my own
I don't break I can hold the chrome
And this weighin' a ton and I'm a son of a gun
My code name is The Only One and Black Thought is bad
These streets he done ran ever since when the game began
I never played the fool
Matta fact I be keepin' it cool
Since money been changing hands
And I'm left to shine, but the legacy that I leave behind be the seed
That'll keep the flame
I don't ask for much but enough room to spread these wings
And the world finna know my name
(Verse 4: Cody Chesnutt)
I don't beg
For no rich man
And I don't scream, and kick, when his shit don't fall in my hands, man
Cuz I know how to still
Fertilize another against my lover's will
I lick the opposition cuz she don't take no pill
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-no dear
You'll be keeping my legend alive
I push my seed in her bush for life
Its gonna work because I'm pushin' it right
If Mary drops my baby girl tonight
I would name her Rock-N-Roll
Oh-ooh break it down, break it down, break down beat

I push my seed somewhere deep in her chest
I push it naked cuz I've takin my test
Deliverin' Mary it don't matter the sex
I'm gon' name it rock and roll
I push my seed in her bush for life
It's gonna work becuz I'm pushin it right

As this manic-depressant un-load with this gung-ho
Wild like a son sold for cash
Guns traded for sensi and hash, crack for ass
Entire crews pass, not makin' the news flash
Brews pass a memory and spark not to blast
Whatever Ave. transform to the war path
Pure wrath from North down to 24th and Task
Game slaughter half the niggas you acquainted with
Streets tainted with camouflage, guerilla sabotage
My cousins Jarette and Todd was livin' type large
Got caught then blast, crashed off on Broad and Lombard
So many so-called hearts scarred, they buried in the yard
Lick shots at Babylon, de one comfy bombard

You ain't missin' nothin', life ain't what it should be
I'll pass across soon, you know who's the enemy
Lots of shit has changed and it's kinda fucked up to see
You remember Tauseen? Nigga thinks life's a dream
Go out fast for the buck, do anythin' for the C.R.E.A.M
Never seen a case like this, although it's quite contagious
He even got his little brother actin' all outrageous
From dusk to dawn, and from dawn back to dusk
They do anythin' and everythin' tryin' to come up
It's kinda sickenin' how the cash is so fuckin' addictive
And when I say son wild, they say that that's conflicted
Ain't nothin' but a contradiction in this world we live in
'Cause the loot is for the takin', and not for the givin'
Then the youngest one will say ""I'mma die hustlin'
Fuck everybody, except my brother who I'm trusted in""
I guess the young boy just did not know the truth
'Cause the followin' week, Tauseen threw him off a roof
And sometimes, I wonder what the fuck I think about that
How nowadays kids get whacked for somethin' less than a pack
But I guess that's how it goes when there ain't no more rep
Thought he was his brother's keeper, but fuck all that
Niggas causin' mayhem from the P.M.'s to A.M.'s
America's worst nightmare: Guns in kids' hands
[Chorus: Jazzyfatnastees & 
Black Thought

Yeah, you in tune to another episode in my area code
Better believe it
All sorts of episodes in my area code
'Cause it is comin'
Where the blocks explode, where the temperature is cold
It's just an episode in my area code
It's another episode in my area code
You won't believe the sight you see before your eyes
All sorts of episodes in my area code
You won't believe the sight you see before your eyes
Where the blocks explode, ride strapped and unload
I seen it unfold in my area code

It was the year of '84, I was tryin' to get in the mix
The year when niggas rolled with sheepskins, Cazals and kicks
Even got the patent-leather Adidas snatched off your feet
Man, that talk is cheap, the crippled can't walk for weeks
The first stoge was rolled to Penn and Teller's
Strolled in the dollar house parties in search for Cinderella
Was just a little man, real bold
Tryin' to act grown and old so that respect'll be shown
A hip-hop, a little bop and the break-dancin'
When niggas wore windbreakers, plot to take lambskins
Remember Zigglers? Uptown, the bottom's not quite the same
St. Charles in South Phil, the Ooh Mob gang
H-R-M Ogontz Ave., Brickyard to Hollow
Niggas was snatchin' Cazals and flippin' pockets for the dallo
You wore your little rope chain in West Oak Lane
And niggas from Logan came to extort, we know the game
You proclaim this gangster bullshit talk
And never even seen your man shot or bodies in chalk
Aggravated assault, another weekend in the precinct
Takin' everybody for a vic, man, that's how we think
Back then, you'd catch a sucker-punch off-guard
Niggas would pull your card, tryin' to walk around all hard
Niggas quick to flip your pockets if you lip-service
When you see fifteen niggas deep with scullys, get nervous
It ain't no tellin' what they could do to you
So, you clutch up, thinkin' and knowin' you gettin' stuck up
In another episode in my area code, episode in my area code
[Chorus: Jazzyfatnastees & 
Black Thought
]
Yeah, you in tune to another episode in my area code
Better believe it
All sorts of episodes in my area code
'Cause it is comin'
Where the blocks explode, where the temperature is cold
It's just an episode in my area code
It's another episode in my area code
You won't believe the sight you see before your eyes
All sorts of episodes in my area code
You won't believe the sight you see before your eyes
Where the blocks explode, ride strapped and unload
I seen it unfold in my area code

Better believe it, 'cause it is comin'
You won't believe the sight you see before your eyes
You won't believe the sight you see before your eyes
Better believe it, 'cause it is comin'",https://genius.com/The-roots-episodes-lyrics

Bent like a boomerang, tryna maintain
I'm both yin and yang from Mi Kan Lang
With your lady hittin' me up, I'm never answering
Let her miss me, see me then she all tryna kiss me
Talkin bout, ""I dig you Tariq, the way you twist me""
Meanwhile, she comin home tipsy, all grinnin
And what you used to fit 'em before, you now swimmin
Just take a dive P-5 deep, the team winnin
Takin hip-hop back to, the beginnin
Cause MC's are pretendin'
I slap your sound out the sky like I'm goaltending
Bring your career to an endin, enter the next era trascendin for real

Schoolly D classic

Servin y'all wherever the place is
Blowin conniseur quality in my competitor's faces
This is without doubt, your lady pass out
This Illa-Fifth Twilight Zone, you ass out
Shout, to my brothers on back route
Whippin the short that's smacked out, dig it
Strump this in your casette deck, hip-hop has not left yet

Whichever mute miniscule mic holder

Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority
Is what I'm probably on
If I ain't whippin' a Land throughout ya sec-tion
My mind's in traum', nine times out of ten, 
I rhymes upon the L train
Within my brain, fountains over rugged mountains of my terrain
Dig it, 
I came too far to front,
 so I'm meditatin' on how to maintain
Stepped off at City Hall into the rain
And ran into my nigga named Dane, I mean Hakeem
And we was buildin' on how we could organize the team
For this capital gain, bein' that we in the rap game
It's time to have it all, he said he figured he same
We realized this a planet of C.R.E.A.M. to obtain
When the predominant rap conglomerate spark the flame
Hark the name, The Fifth from the Ill Power Hill at that
He dropped me off within the streets of South Phil'
Where niggas think that killin' is livin' real
Shorties is gettin' wetted, fulfillin' their fantasies to set it
We don't sweat it, by The Fifth you get beheaded
I pivot through my borough, givin' pounds to the dreaded
At the lye spots, I got credit
Could run 'em down in alphabetic-al order, it's sorta pathetic
Yo, I'm livin' life within a labyrinth of nonsense
This is a consequence of bein' Philly residents
Tryin' to get it on, the rhythm gettin' shitted on
The exquisite I exhibit to shine, yo

To all my peoples on the planet stimulatin' they mind

C'mon and push up ya lighter, up ya lighter
Up ya lighter 'fore we spark the fire
To all my peoples on the planet stimulatin' they mind

C'mon and push up ya lighter, up ya lighter
Up ya lighter 'fore we spark, check it out

Check it out
I walk through this field with 'iminals
Ill die-hard soldiers try to make it towards the generals
Hard-headed rugged captains, walkin' head-on through action
Turnkeys on the closed caption
I bring the skills of wizardry, treat MC's with bigotry
So, now you see the picture vividly
Seduce your brain from the temple over instrumentals
The Fifth chant, you see the exhaust out the swift camp
Mannerism is to scan your vision
You see the light, you can't eclipse the sun
We call back the young, but still they'll strap a gun
To shoot caps that spook cats and rappers hung
Now, you might tube across
From the diner's where you find 'em lost
Niggas' hearts so cold, they sport frost
The M-the-Illitant, the Bad Lieutenant kill ya camp
You're now a victim of reality, my personality afflicted
From three-to-five if convicted
Illicit, because most cats will live corrupted
It ain't no pity in this inner city, niggas, fuck it
Exquisite I exhibit to shine, now, check it out

To all my peoples on the planet stimulatin' they mind
All my peoples that be knowin' the time
C'mon and push up ya lighter, up ya lighter

C'mon and push up ya lighter, up ya lighter
Up ya lighter 'fore we spark, check it out

Inclined to rap about facts, I never fake jacks
Shit is real like E packs, forty-fifty-sixes, trims and gimmicks
Couldn't faze the true heartache when I first started
But then few remember this
Anti-Gangsta Bitch, sportin' new jew-als
Plain Jane styles eternal to the naked eye
Derived from mind-states of Cold Crush tapes
And beat breaks seduced by means to elevate
Equates my views with the passion
Those matchin' this intellect identify for like-minds
Intertwine one thought in unison
The exquisite I exhibit to shine, ahhh

To all my peoples on the planet stimulatin' they mind

All she ever seem to do is play it cool, f'real
She be pushin' Pop's vessel, and his shoe's is ill
But her hand keep slippin' on the woodgrain wheel
But it's cool, we never slippin' when it's moves to make
Especially when what we talkin' ain't ya usual cake
I pump bass for y'all bathin' apes, to get charged
Nah, I'm not a dealer, I'm a poet at large
We in the wind with the roof back, lettin' the breeze hit us
The bathrobe on with sweatpants and slippers
Comin' to pay a visit to whoever on the hit-list
Some of y'all been tryin' for years, you'll never get this, fool

Hip-Hop my main bitch, I got a few on the side
The game stitched, yo, I'm doin' my job
Go up against enormous odds
Wouldn't break a sweat, money make a bet
Funny son, you threat, well I ain't shakin' yet
Twenty-fo'/sev' chillin', tougher than penicillin
From the block where the crooked cops killin' like a villain
Children in the hood gettin' rocked by they buildings
And brothers 'cross the board gettin' knocked by the millions
The stress got me ignitin' the potent marijuana leaf
Tryin' to play it cooler than a polar bear colony
You feel the music, know I'm over there probably
Pimpin' on the same system that forever shorted me
I got the soul of a young Sam Cooke when I spit
It make you wanna make a new dance up
It's all to the good shorty, go on, do that stuff
It's not another sound system rockin' steady as us
And it's cool

(Stay Cool) yeah (Stay Cool) stay cool, ha

the Jakes
 harass me
They never ride past me, they really comin' at me, right
They wanna know where the drugs, guns and cash be
Probably wanna get me to run, so they can blast me
Just blast me in your box, play my shit
I know it's crowded at the top, 'cause I'm on the tip
And that's as high up at the top as a brother could get
And how I do it make a lot of muh'fuckers upset
But it's fine, 
'Riq Jizzle
 and I'm back for mine
In case y'all gettin' tired of the same ol' shine
And I'm calm, calculated and perfectly aligned
The way I'm operatin', what is it? Surgery or rhyme?
It's not a thang when I lower the gradient lens frames
I'm cooler than Clyde Stubblefield, drummer for James
Hip-Hop is out of Hustleville, comin' for change
I exercise 'til a muscle build, breakin' the chains
And it's cool

Yo, Jam Boy magic, Mr. Fantastic
Masterful mind, the list that I've crafted
Fresh new trick to flip, I'm Dick Dastard
Half smooth criminal and half straight bastard
No mask when your flag get captured
First class, take you to the rap hereafter
Gone in a flash and yet, he gets faster
Sick when he hits the mic like Mixmaster
This the Battle of Troy with no Pastor
Slicker than a can of oil with no castor
Chill in the front of the flight, outclass them
Bring your favorite rapper to fight, I'll trash him
Then I'll leave in a timely fashion
Uh, emcees get the tiny rations
Your girl hold me close as a tiny dancer
You got a death wish? Well it's finally answered, prick

Yo, Jam Boy magic, Mr. Sarcastic
Rap catalogue consists of all classics
Blackness, cause your (bitch) to fall backwards
Fuck a hood pass, my shit's for all-access
Killing tracks like this, we call practice
Any bullshit y'all twist, we call backwards
Jam Boy sharp as a tack, we all cactus
Waiting on a big payback with no taxes
So if you follow the game, you might catch this
Act like an activist; you know, active
Nigga like me just has to spit acid
Sucker like you just has to get blasted
Ashes to ashes, Frazier to Cassius
No homo, y'all some pains in the asses
Get turned to toast like raising your glasses
When I'm on stage, girls swing from the rafters
Often nasty like Monster Mashing
Y'all know the voice is tight, hoarse and raspy
Can't place the face, kind of hard to catch me
Kings that pull strings like Dorothy Ashby
Jawns keep telling me I'm great like Gatsby
Caught like a felony, you can't slide past me
I'm lowkey, kind of anti-flashy
Then I'm OG up in a black tie classy

Sun Ra

Mumm-Ra
Son of a shooter letting slugs from a gun fly
Should call a Mumbai with the bumbaclot

Banging yacht rock with my squad from 215
Straight calling niggas out like the umpire
Any chump tryna front, 
word 'em up

Jam Boy magic, Mr. Get-Busy
You get busy too? Then get with me too, we'll get busy, dig me?
Smooth Remy, tool skinny but hold plenty
.22 long contact, new Bentley
No miles yet, curve backs and cruise and he
Bring it back when you through with it, roger that
Grip tenny, French manies in Vic' panties
Lips candy, dick hard as a fifth of Brandy
Hop in it for 5 minutes then I'm finished
Cause pussy is pleasure but I'm attending my business
Retractable roof, magical coupe disappearing
And reappearing, German engineering this McLaren
Hot jacuzzis, watching movies, Glock and uzis
Shots of Louis, busting cuties popping jeweries
Ooh, Ultramag' MC in a M3
Whole body tatted straight up outta NP",https://genius.com/The-roots-web-20-20-lyrics
The Hypnotic,Illadelph Halflife,1996.0,"The Hypnotic, The Hypnotic, The Hypnotic...

Yo, I knew this girl named Alana with mad persona
She dealt with reality, she never fed into the drama
I met her through my nigga named Jermaine Palmer
Who knew her through his peoples by the Baltimore Harbor
Alana was a Marilyn
Thorough and attractive shorty that's relaxed with me
And kickin' back with a phat flick to cool out
Was stressed 'cause the game'll make you wanna pull a tool out
And go the old-school route
But all of that ceased when that piece checkin' the jewel out
A brother was charged, light a spliff and listen to The DeBarge
Let the shorty hit me with a massage to anoint
Lubricatin' my meridian points
That was the summer, easy to remember
Alana was all up on Tariq agenda; how I used to back-bend her
She even told her best friend Belinda from Virginia
Who asked me if I had a cousin I could recommend her
But as time flowed on, we grew more mature and further apart
When I began to do tours, we lost contact and slowly parted
Reminiscin' of when it started
It keep me feelin' heavy hearted
A stolen moment, periodic
Addicted to her presence like a narcotic
Though, I wonder if she ever got it, The Hypnotic
That faded like a dream sequence that persuaded
Beyond bein' infatuated, spiritually intoxicated
Calm, sedated, I concentrated on how to get in touch with her
'Cause the fact of the matter remain that I miss The Hypnotic

(Driftin') The Hypnotic, The Hypnotic, check it out
(Driftin') The Hypnotic, The Hypnotic, c'mon
(Driftin') The Hypnotic, The Hypnotic, check it out
(Driftin') The Hypnotic, The Hypnotic, c'mon

I would begin to dial her number
But knowin' it's been a while, it's hard to link
I figure what she'd probably think and soon start to drink
Fightin' the feelin' I'm concealin', apparently at first appeal and
Later revealin' to be deeper, resistance increasingly weaker
The essence of life is more than just mics and puffin' reefer
This universe of Black Thought that I can teach ya
I'm tryin' to touch ya, but only if I can reach ya
I hit this kid Hassan up on his beeper
And asked him if he had a chance to speak to
Jermaine Palmer, whose father's a preacher
To make the story short, me and my man soon ran
Into each other on the humble at a show in San Fran
I said, ""Yo, Palmer, when did you last see Alana?""
He offered me a seat in attempts to make me calmer
When he began to break it down, my mind start to wander
Response beyond somber
Incredibly crushed, kinda feelin' on my shoulder that of a boulder
To find out that her life was over, it made the room feel colder
I thought I could get with her when she was a little older
But she a victim of the wicked system that controlled her
It's all chaotic within my life, it's symbolic
Forever shadow on my mental, I never forgot it
Yo, the psychotic, The Hypnotic
Yo, check it out, the most melodic Hypnotic, yeah",https://genius.com/The-roots-the-hypnotic-lyrics

All the crimes of hate just ain't the size and shape
You can walk down the block and get slumped or knocked
It don't stop, y'all, and it just don't stop
Come with it

Dig it, I leaves the microphone intrigued with my practice
This rebel sticks to the system like a cactus, avoid sadness
Who knows what is concealed under the mattress?
Lugers, losses and grindles when my mind's in blackness
Then I act this way, the beast unleashed
Rabbis, monks and priests always pray for peace
But it's deceased, now only lives the true real-ness
Open up the mental depths, you've entered to my palace
My thoughts contain the blood sign, plus the malice
Not equatin' to your Wonderland, so fuck Alice
My style is hostile on the external
But got plenty of love and warmth that's internal
This sin colonel surfaces from whispers from the lower
My Noah-like arks and 950 years of knowin'
Your arch rival, they burn a cross, I burn the Bible
Because I'm liable to do this, when my action's crudest
But I'd rather choose to use my diction
Resurrect that blonde, blue-eyed
And put him through another crucifixion
Stay up in your jurisdiction (Say what?)
My depiction is the drama
Through these eyes, I've seen the trauma
Homicides in the source that was phenomenal
When I find out who banged Muwan in his abdominal
Met with Jesus to learn to Burns, not comical
At times, this thing ain't logical
I gots to walk around with my brain on cock
'Cause it can't (can't) won't (won't) don't (don't) stop, dig it!

Dig it, this world is filled with homicides and rape
All the crimes of hate just ain't the size and shape
You can walk down the block and get slumped or knocked
It don't stop, y'all, and it just don't stop

My mental's inflamed, your brains will drain
When I let the ink drip, and then pass out a pink slip
I think quick, so check my methodology
My style-agy is more antique than anthropology
Between your raw legs like it's gynecology
You and your sorry-ass style needs an apology
Cause an earthquake and make you shake, you need neurology
These niggas kill me, actin' like stars, fuck they astrology
Imagine, with my badge, I snatch the pageant (Ha!)
Turn your city to a smash-and-grab-it
Now it's time to burn the maggots
My message stronger than Elijah
To back-slap that ass like your father
Why bother with any kaffir?
Lyrics I sling from my mic will cease your laughter
Mind of a bachelor to a master
What I doctored leaves you flabbergasted
Ask you, ""What's the matter, bastard?""
These types of rhythms, man, you'd rather blast it
You hear the beats in jeeps over the weekend
Silence is golden and niggas get killed just for speakin'
The only beacon is death when you're left wounded
Layin' on the ground and meet your doom quick
I done been through the deserts of Hell with Satan sittin', waitin'
Contemplatin' and tryin' to get me for the takin'

At times, I feel as if could pull a kamikaze
Illuminati rally in the Civic Center lobby
They seeds in the world student body
Probably creatin' missiles, they got my child holdin' pistols
Knowledge and understand will make a man murder
Stand further, fuck all the swine plus the hamburger
No hallucinant, the Lieutenant plus Militant
Aryan murder, that's mental
Credentials is I am a Hell residential
With fire for the presidential
Eventually, it's havoc in the temple
I terrorize the heavens
Bring on the renaissance with the sevens and civilize the reverence
Reprimand the deacon, keepin' him from speakin'
Tell him cease the false preachin'
I step like a shadow on the way to hot concrete
And observe my peoples in the essence every weekend
We wonder, what the fuck is schools teachin'?
Intoxicated soldiers in chaotic times reachin'
The Dynasty is sim, but we only resemble what's grim
We attack to split your back, then we extort your specimen
I put this in your system like lecithin
Then maneuver mentally from in-ternal medicine
I hold the fort down with Malik
Symbolic to the bond of word that's Islamic
The killer forces I deposit, dealin' with logic
I keep my brain on cock, it don't stop!

Or would it be the same for you like I was Eric Clapton, huh?
Clap for you freedom dog, that's what's happening
My spit take critical political action
The hustle is a puzzle each piece is a fraction
And every word that's understood is a transaction
I'm an S.P. soldier, microphone holder
Rep Philly set from Bolivia to Boulder
Paris, France to 10th & Tioga
How we gonna make it through the dark, I show ya

I tell you one lesson I learned
If you want to be something in life
You ain't gonna get it unless
You give a little bit of sacrifice
Ooohh, sometimes before you smile you got to cry
You need a heart that's filled with music
If you use it you can fly
If you want to be high

Listen, yo kick off your shoes, jump off the jock
I fly higher than them dudes, from off your block
My name Black, the style is unorthodox
It tap chins in your mens 'til you thought could box
A couple of people wanted Thought to stop, but guess what?
My man grab the missile, plug for the gut
Now next time beatty stop being such a glut
I'm precise with it like Faheim with haircuts
We up close on 'em with toast but no crust
It's fructose on 'em they froze and won't bust
Choke on your face you jewels is lacklust
Got to put it to you straight, y'all fools is jacked up
Came close to the upmost but no cigar
Nose to the grindstone, head to the stars
The number one runner with the number one drummer
Grammy award winnin' it's the world's eighth wonder
Come on

I tell you one lesson I learned
If you want to be something in life
You ain't gonna get it unless
You give a little bit of sacrifice
Ooohh, sometimes before you smile you got to cry
You need a heart that's filled with music
If you use it you can fly
If you want to be high

Your first impression might be I'm a asshole
Or say I'm sometimey and give people a hassle
Or try to suntouch and put the heat in the capsule
Dog I'm far deeper than that though; I get in the zone
Recognize I'm a rolling stone
No time to lollygag or lounge with scaliwags
Give me the disc or I put it where your body at
Old school spit flow laid over Trotter tracks
With no apology fraud or trick-knowledgy
Just trust, what I see and I say and follow me my way
I read an open booklet inside me
The star of the story that groove teller got me
Through all the dark times part of the business
The light be contingent on small forensics
My microphone'll make a man a newborn infant
It's true so the crew gon' sense it
I get in the zone

I tell you one lesson I learned
If you want to be something in life
You ain't gonna get it unless
You give a little bit of sacrifice
Ooohh, sometimes before you smile you got to cry
You need a heart that's filled with music
If you use it you can fly
If you want to be high
I tell you one lesson I learned
If you want to be something in life
You ain't gonna get it unless

False Media,Game Theory,2006.0,"""And we will weaken ourselves for what is really the issue. And then, behind that all lies a very personal, intuitive belief: that I don't think old men ought to promote wars for young men to fight.""

America's lost somewhere inside of Littleton

False media—

If I can't work to make it, I'll rob and take it
Either that or me and my children are starving and naked
Rather be a criminal pro than to follow the Matrix
Hey, it's me, a monster y'all done created, I been inaugurated
Keep the bright lights out of our faces
You can't shake it; it ain't no way to swallow the hatred
Aim, fire, holler 'bout a dollar, nothing is sacred
We gon' pimp the shit out of nature
Send our troops to get my paper
Tell 'em, ""Stay away from them skyscrapers
Ain't long 'fore you get y'all acres""
I'ma show 'em who the glo-bal gangster
Sentence me to four more years, thank you
I'ma make you feel a little bit safer, because it ain't over—
See, that's how we get your fear to control you
But ain't nobody under more control than the soldier
And how could you expect a kid to keep his composure
When all sorts of thoughts fought for exposure again?

Theme from Middle of the Night,…and then you shoot your cousin,2014.0,"Only the lonely love
Only the sad of soul
Wake and begin their day in the middle of the night
To breakfast on their pride
Where joys and tears just dried
To breakfast with the moon
In the middle of the night
Then to cut once more, my miserly hoard
Of your kisses in this darkness restored
To grasp your absent grace
In desperate embrace
To make your false heart true

My band about seventy strong just like Fela
Yeah, part Melle-Mel, part Van Halen
And we represent Illadel, where they still rebellin'
Ayo, sicko show like Mike Moore
My city ain't nothin' like yours, 
slippin' into darkness like war
Night crawl with the lights off
You see a lot of life lost for the white horse
Regardless, the charges making us all targets
All on the red carpet, guns from the black market
Ay, who got the politician's in they back pocket?
Pimp slap, pump that, give me that profit
When you make contact, give me that gossip
If you break contract, you'll be that hostage

Approach with caution, be cautious when talking to bosses
I feel I've been through a metamorphosis
I'm mutated by unknown forces
The feeling of course is, somethin' that's hard to describe
I'm half-dead, never felt more alive
Reborn, remove the gold coins from my eyes
I've been down, but now I'm back up
I'm about to act up, boy, you better back up
And when you see me set up shop, know to pack up
Cause I crack up when a rapper get slapped up
Number one reason y'all should give rap up
Dice, it's mines, I got it all wrapped up

I'll come directly at your OG neck
I'm used to the 1-2 check, not the 1-2 step
I'm strapped, I'll leave every cat among you wet
Now let's go, you know I'm politically incorrect
At the show, I start it with a, ""Can I get a ho?""
And the hoes go retarded
The po-po tape off the stage for caution
It's bad lands, North Philly get it in

Why (What’s Goin On?),The Tipping Point,2004.0,"Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?
Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?

Sky's the limit so you know I'm gonna rise and shine
I gotta do my thing, I'm kinda getting a little tired of all that's hidden
That's the reason I'm a speak my mind, keep from going insane
Now work with it, we in the last innin'
The world keeps spinnin', my peoples steady losin' while the rich keep winnin'
It's like we never smilin' and the devil steady grinnin'
Killin' what we representin'
Even our children and women, 2K4, livin' above and under the law
Young teen joins the marines, says he'll die for the corps
Inducted up into the government's war
Is it for land or money or oil
Funny how ain't none of it yours
I can't sleep yo I'm paranoid, it's code orange
It's far from right, I guess that's why it feels so wrong
To see the world get stripped out of every resource
And people pray to Coca-Cola now instead of the gods
What's goin' on?

Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?
Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?

Keepin' your head above water, hustlin' to survive
Some people chasin' a dream, others just chasin' a high
Some people blind leading the blind, they chasin' a lie
Some people chokin' backs broken barely makin' it by
But still, they workin' all they live, they pushin' for the light
Givin' everything they got to stitch them swishes on ya Nike's
Puttin' pockets on our jeans, mining diamonds for them rings
Rewarded with small change and bullets in the brains
And it make me feel strange everything we take for granted
At times I feel stranded on this planet of mine
Now should I pull the hammer, clap it out, and laugh about it
Or stand up, be counted while I cast my ballot
When the undertaker's busy and the prisons is crowded
People livin' in fear because they vision is clouded
But the sky's the limit, I ain't cryin' you a river
Gotta move me a mountain, I'm a get up and shout it

Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?
Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?

When I dream it's hounds on my heels gainin' momentum
I'm tired, can't get uninspired or quit runnin'
I can feel they only inches behind, I escape, I survive
Some how I gotta decide how much I want it
Or is anybody listenin' without a pot to piss in
If I disappear I wonder if the world will know I'm missin'
Who my support system, it's not the court system
Gotta letter it said that you're not avoiding prison
People 'neath the microscope cause we defining the culture
They smile and insult you like you shinin' their loafers
Them old heads say we need a modern day Moses
When the leaders is posers we needing some soldiers
It's the X generation, the anger in the nation
Got the writing on the wall so clear that I can taste it
Like a kid sniffing glue somewhere trying to escape
Cause we vulnerable and naked
Gotta show 'em we can make it

Comin' thru with the ill convoy
Yes, sir, hah, yeah
Lieutenant with the Com
Break it down one, two
We about to drop the bomb, check it

And your verse at core for what you thought before
Steppin' up into a zone you should never explore
The next step or level of the whole concept or

Check it, one-two
Rappers, get on the mic talkin' about cars and clothes
Soundin' like hoes
Ain't been exposed to the foes, the most disciples
I'm from the state that is ill
The rap son of man rotated down to Phil
To say what I feel, get it off my bird chest, my word becomes flesh
War, goin' on between the West and the East
Of the lands, niggas don't own a piece
Grease is the word, Murray slides some pimp oil to me
My lady friend sneaks my beer in the movie
Throw your hands in the air, if you the true and livin'
Beware - The New World Order, the devil's new religion
Sent my homie to the number two division
Sellin' bootlegged movies, got my VCR on a oove' smoove'
Be at Fat Tuesday's, drinkin' tropical and just sittin'
At a table with sophisticated bitches
Nah, that ain't nothin' I would call my mother
Nor do I call every nigga my brother
Gotta have Black Thought, it sorta B like Malik
So, don't Question a Brother, to The Roots, I get deep

Yo, enter the last era
Your scholarship into the world of politics and mascara
We operate within this artificial op-era
I bring hip-hop terror like the Führer
The Ace Ventura into the horror
Laboratory labor-er, venture beyond the border
I'll struc-ture a style, destroy your whole aura
Plus, your a-drenalin'll rise before your eyes
Immortalize my image in the skies
Deceive the devil in disguise
My music I parenthesize, represent the wise
Through this be how we enterprise
Kid, no compromise (Yeah, yeah) I'm thinkin' fast like Rama-
Dan, I wear your mind away like Alzheimer
I pull a mic up out my mama, big up to Bahama-
Dia, ayyo, this year we leavin' 'em in trauma
Then after me, I plan to leave behind the legacy
Or history of the family, the Fifth Dynasty
For humanity to bear witness to this
Del-Val' sylla-ble stylist
You know the time, kid

And your verse at core for what you thought before
Steppin' up into a zone you should never explore
The next step or level of the whole concept or

Yo, the general flows, kids compose on tablets
Expose how they was average and they thoughts not rapid
Here comes the hot package through your block like traffic
The rock was type graphic, now watch the mic blast it
Shootin' at the stars with emphatic rap static
See the mirror shatter from thoughts, I'm bustin' back at it
The Lieuten-ant, the eleph-ant, sippin' automatic
Mic rippin' Asiatic, architects out to have it
The turn of the century
The planet's like a penitentiary exaggerated
Niggas is livin' highly medicated
I Used To Love H.E.R., now she violated
Hip-hop holocausts and camps, old champs are concentrated
They outdated and incarcerated
Loved and appreciated, hated and very debated
For every career created, one's eliminated
And that's the way the balance of Yin and Yang is related, fa' real!

Every block is divine, niggas swing on in a safari
Wild niggas, like I'm high on latari
Some let the block block they mind, if they could see what I see
Get out the city for a sec, be at the places I be
Hey, I'mma be back on the deck
Openin' businesses in places, for you to cash yo' cheque
My neck of the woods ain't all good, ain't all bad
You can live in the 'burbs and still get had
The sad part about it: Niggas had houses on the lake
They tryin' to move us out, the land we ain't appreciate
For peace we skate, crackers be rollerbladin' on hate
Call each other ""Cuz"" 'cause of how we relate
I seen way too many Cadillacs with dopeman plates
Through the wind and blow-ups is how niggas communicate
Harmonizin' through beepers and reefer

Well I'm a downtown shooter, who that?
The crown ruler is back, he kind of grew into the shape of a mack
Look how I do it, yo I'm taking you back
This how you rise down to the foundation, how sacred is that?
I'm from the number one place on the map

And we don't stress for nothing, I just press the button
It's as simple as just making it hap'
To all the frauds stop faking, relax, and to the broads if you caking
Then clap then shake it without breaking your back

So good rappers ain't eating, they Olsen twining
But I'm so committed, they have grown familiar
With the counterfeit hitters, they so-so with it, but they are Sosa with it
They Mark McGwire with the written, I'm Rodriguez
On the road to riches this is the fork I'm hitting

Show me where your first impression is at
And where your dedication to the true profession is at

A genius slash gangsta with a skill for swindling

And y'all cold like a show in the Netherlands
Cold shoulders and frozen aortic valves -
So I don't form pals - conform to norms - morals different
Gifted - use it to shift shit a mutant shape shifter when I spit it I'm liquid
You could lick a million shots at the character of the body shell
They'll just richochette nigga aura's hard as hell
Before there was ain't hard to tell
The mic's cycle coincided right with mine as well
Since a minor I walked with the spine upstraight
I learned to rhyme to feed the dinner plate
I scraped barrel - even dined up on wine and steaks
Cuz in the bone same marrow that apartheid chased
The narrow margin with the haves and the have nots
Will get smaller as I approach - so watch your stash box
Fox logo if your face is local
Get bruised till you're the color of the Laker's logo

Ain't no innovations - that takes concentration

Tired of my people failin'

The Coming,…and then you shoot your cousin,2014.0,"I hear somebody screaming
Again, bracing for a fall
Close my eyes, but I never wonder
I have seen it all

They don't remember
Was it coming? Was it going?
Were they running from the sun?
Racing through the morning, I'm coming
Ain't no chance my footsteps were on the road
No one sees, and no one knows
I'm coming, I'm coming

So, when we begin to assassinate your cast members
Here on this agenda, there is no pretenders
So, when we begin to assassinate your cast members

Dig it, cool, calm, collect in my perspective
Search the premises, I leave no clues for detectives
My verbal impact across your back, slap!
You talk about you see me, but your vision's full of cataract
It don't matter that, your glass house, I shatter that
Bad luck I walk under, now show me where the ladder at
Fill up the urinal organs up in your bladder, cat
Approachin' you with shriller rhetoric, as if you had a sack
Now, crews down Broad - your gas pedal floored
With ammo and artillery and stash spot's the cheeba store
I use the banner of Islam for the sword
Change your strategic plan, my man's gettin' bored
Your vocal chord is fraudulent, and not the true porcelain
I bring the fire, earth and the source of wind
The force of sin will endorse the pen
We all search for sanity, but I think that it was lost again
Now, which stick-up artist can be the smartest?
My beam of sunlight shines the brightest and the farthest
Regardless of this bitch life because I pimp her
Control the temper, makin' MC's whimper
I tilt the Earth from off the axis in the center
Next, I'm in the womb like a placenta
M-Illitant the city ninja, uplift 'cause I'm the soul avenger Remember, I'm No Great Pretender

Strategist, I bet y'all niggas can't believe this
I read you like a whole avenue that's filled with meters
Punks, fuck your back-talk, I watch how niggas catwalk
Over my pit of venom and send 'em to the asphalt
For inquisitives who wanna try to test me
What protects me, will make you shake like epilepsy
Plague your neighborhood with lyrical le-prosy
Stimulate more than ecstasy, y'all niggas check my recipe
Dig it, I'm most observant, analyze when I'm chillin'
Peep out who's the villain then make out your whole pavilion
Of a Sicilian, excuse the greed, don't want a mill', I want a zillion
Stacks of Franklins to the ceilin'
I count stacks imported, fuck the yacht and the mansion
I want Pluto and Jupiter, political, universal expansion
Buy out Tommy and Helly Hansen
Kidnap America, 'Riq, you hold it for ransom
Pass it down to my grandson, I got no time to be romancin'
Only times for mental food and advancement
This game of life is strictly chancin'
Get to know the nature
Before I get to know the nigga while I'm glancin'
Enhancin' is my mental
I play in the midst of squads and peeps
Most crews is not in the halfs of rentals
My utensils display a whole variety
Even when in the cut, niggas can't cut they anxiety
Peep, I fill your brain with suspicion
Pay attention like you pay tuition
And stop all your bull-ishin'
The rap chemist in the lab 'til the finish
The mic is my apprentice 
'cause I can't stand courts or tennis
My pigmentation is the menace
That's why the system's always tryin' to pursue with a blemish
Pale asses think a nigga in this
My flow's tremendous, for the meal you can't replenish
The question you ask: Will situations get worse?
Fam, I won't befriend ya, 'cause I'm No Great Pretender

Fuck around, spill this 'gnac on my two hundred dollar suit

Your ma don't like to jitterbug, said this unholy music
Hip hop just so ridiculous, everything sounds so confusing
Nowadays ain't nothing like it was, one thing that showed the blues
Is this system so mysterious, can't let that stop the movement
Can't get no satisfaction, they all laughing, glad it's happening
All ringside for the main attraction
Acting a fool with a lust for action
Young girl caught in a crime of passion
Sitting there crying in designer fashion
Didn't blow, didn't have time for asking
""Somebody call for the ambulances"", girl

Baby, baby, baby
Baby let me live, please girl let me slide
Baby, baby, baby
Baby if you let me go, I swear I'll change, just change your mind

Your old man don't like to jitterbug, said this old dirty music
Hip hop just so ridiculous, them stories too confusing
Nowadays he ain't loving you like he was
And you ain't there just for using
Could have sworn that was him with another girl
And they wasn't out just for cruising
Can't get no satisfaction
He out late nights, probably smashing
Leaving a trail like trolley tracks
Or the train on the ground, downtown Manhattan
Everybody seen him run around and you bound to catch him
The condoms, you found and asked him, was all this just for practice?
He didn't realize what he had
Now your heart got fractured, girl

The Adventures in Wonderland,Illadelph Halflife,1996.0,"Fuck.. kill.. and prosper
Is the gospel of Wonderland, where
Street sands, are quick..
To suck you down to the abyss
With the lure of pure bliss if you kiss the dicks
Of the niggas? Never.. Nosferatu's
Those witches and warlocks in blue
Government gumshoe, keepers of the First Zoo
Who? .. Me? ..
I'm the modern day vixen vampire slayer
Unauthorized player, in the capitalist contest
To see who ""Gets Money""
No milk and honey, in this land
Cause justice has been banned
So it's play dirty or die by the hand
That's holding all the guns
Plunged, deep into religion was my first decision
To save me and my daughter's lives, but
I can't thrive off spirit and scripture
The picture grew clearer; I made the move to rear her
In a life wanting for nothing
So I got into this drug thing
Not doing, but dealing
Sealing fates and, healing struggle gaped, wounds
Of the doomed became my mission
Izm was just too small time
I had to find the best design to
Fuck with the massive motherfuckers minds, and pockets
So I sold cock hits and, alleyway thigh splits for two bits
And, five year old preschool pussy
And, once strong now bony backs and stretched out
Weary racks of snatch, in other words..
.. I sold crack
Morality was buried deep, beneath the new Jeep
Silk sheets and money heaps
Still the good mother, I sent my daughter off to
Boarding school to keep shit under cover
All the while envisioning myself, a champion of ghetto causes
Plus his, game I was playing, and winning
While sinning, against myself and soul to get the gold
I was the Female Don, the Crack Queen
To me I seemed unstoppable, my coffers full
I went buckwild, wanting more
Like the pipe worn whores I began to deplore
No time for playing with my coochie
Counting my man's mad lucci
While he was up inside some hoochie's loose piece
I signed the checks and, I counted out the cash
Wasn't saving ass for no niggas sent upriver
I thought my shit was tight..
.. til my empire started to quiver
Taking every chance, under surveillance, being listened to
And watched, like Assata Shakur
My place on the top was no more sure
Loose lips flipped the script
The fantasy trip, swiftly ended
It took no time to blend in, with the population prison
My jaded vision, busted like a cherry
Every, dream I had, now tainted bad
I fucked and, I killed, to prosper
Upheld each tenant, of the ghastly gospel
Shift to a different Wonderland to pay the price for my vice
A land of fields to toil in like slaves
No 
lillies in this field
 just plenty of souls to save
Plenty of fat uniformed rats with
Below average size cocks that slither
Through cell locks, in the night
Lactating tits being licked, left and right
Plenty of coochie, 
burning with desire
Like black churches in the South
Black prayers and pussy on fire
Penned up behind barbed wire
Me and my fellow female mammals, animals
Bitches in cages, bodies racked with hormone rages
Minds haunted by our children's faces
They mace us, with promises of rehabilitation slash corruption
Place smoking guns in empty hands of, native sisters and sons
I joined in this nation's favorite pasttime
On a quest to gets mine
Now I'm passing time standing on line
In the commissary to buy Maxi-Pads
Instead of shopping at Barney's for Chanel bags
Nana who raised me, went to bed a-dazed
Via my mistakes, and my daughter hates
Me for what I did
And I'm FUCKED.. and I'm STUCK
Doing the Devil's bid
Being locked in a moral corrupt crib
Psst.. missing my kid.. psst.. hey girl
You wanna get finger fucked tonight?
I swear I'll stick it in and up tight just right
Yo sis.. I've had to kill and shit
Just blow my head pretty and I'll give you a slip

Something in the Way of Things (In Town),Phrenology,2002.0,"In town
In town
In town
Something in the way of things
Something that will quit and won't start
Something you know but can't stand
Can't know get along with, like death
Riding on top of the car
Peering through the windshield for his cue
Something entirely fictitious and true
That creeps across your path hallowing your evil ways
Like they were yourself passing yourself not smiling
The dead guy you saw me talking to is your boss
I tried to put a spell on him but his spirit is illiterate
I know things you know and nothing you don't know
'Cept I saw something in the way of things
Something grinning at me and I wanted to know, was it funny?
Was it so funny it followed me down the street?
Greeting everybody like the good humor man
And they got the taste of good humor
But no ice cream
It was like that, me talking across people into the houses
And not seeing the beings crowding around me with ice picks
You could see them
But they looked like important Negroes on the way to your funeral
Looked like important jiggaboos on the way to your auction
And let them chant the numbers
And use an ivory pointer to count your teeth
Remember Steppen Fetchit?
Remember Steppen Fetchit, how we laughed?
And all your Sunday school images giving flesh and jiggling
With the ice pick high off his head
Made ya laugh, anyway
I can see something in the way of ourselves
I can see something in the way of ourselves
That's why I say the things I do
You know it, but it's something else to you
Like that job
This morning, when you got there and it was quiet
And the machines were yearning, soft, behind you
Yearning for their nigga to come and give up his life
Standin' there bein' dissed and broke and troubled
My mistake is I kept sayin' ""that was proof God didn't exist""
And you told me, ""nah..."" Well, it's proof that the devil do
But still, it's like I see something I hear things
I saw words in the white boy's lying rag
Said he was gonna die poor and frustrated
That them dreams walk witch you 'cross town
S'gonna die from over work
There's garbage on the street that's tellin' you you ain't shit
And you almost believe it
Broke and mistaken all the time
You know some of the words, but they ain't the right ones
Your cable back on but ain't nothin' you can see
But I see something in the way of things
Something to make us stumble
Something to get us drunk from noise and addicted to sadness
I see something and feel something, stalking us
Like an ugly thing floating at our back, calling us names
You see it and hear it too
But you say, ""It got a right to exist just like you
And if God made it..."" But then we got to arguin'
And the light gon' come down around us
Even though we remember where the mic is
Remember the Negro squinting at us through the cage
You seen what I see too?
The smile that ain't a smile but teeth flying against our necks
You see something too, but can't call its name
""Ain't it too bad?"" y'all said
""Ain't it too bad? Such a nice boy, always kind to his mother
Always said good morning to everybody on his way to work""
But that last time before he got locked up and hurt, real bad
I seen him walkin' toward his house and he wasn't smiling
And he didn't even say hello
But I knew he'd seen something
Something in the way of things
That it worked on him like it do in will
And he kept marching faster and faster away from us
And never even muttered a word
Then the next day he was gone
You wanna know what?
You wanna know what I'm talkin' about?
Sayin' ""I seen something in the way of things""
And how the boy's face looked that day
Just before they took him away
The 
is
 in that face and remember now
Remember all them other faces
And all the many places you've seen 'em
Or the sister with his child
Wandering up the street
Remember what you seen in your own mirror
And didn't for a second recognize
The face, your own face
Straining to get out from behind the glass
Open your mouth like you was gon' say somethin'
Close your eyes and remember what you saw
And what it made you feel like
Now, don't you see something else?
Something cold and ugly
Not invisible but blended with the shadow
Criss-crossing the old man
Squatting by the drug store at the corner
With his head resting uneasily on his folded arms
And the boy that smiled and the girl he went with
And in my eyes too
A waving craziness splitting them
Into the jet stream of a black bird
With his ass on fire
Or the solemn not-ness of where we go
To know we gon' be happy
I seen something!
I SEEN something!
And you seen it too!
You seen it too!
You just can't call its name...",https://genius.com/The-roots-something-in-the-way-of-things-in-town-lyrics

And reach a little child in the same degree
And my elders excel, I mean, what the hell?
We might as well bridge these gaps
And all before we fall in the fire

There's a million MC's up on a plan they call real, tryin' to set it
Profess mic techniques illegit
Inaccurate perceptions of reality embedded in they minds
Thus, they rhymes I discredit, check it out now

I use my music, implement it with jewels and sport tools
To inspire all these too-cool fools who say ""screw school""
'Cause they don't see the conspiracy
That's put here to trap you and me, but we can get out

Y'all know the Bad Lieutenant
Be on some whole 'nother other finesse genetic
They say I get it from my mother, so it's inheredit-ary
And very necessary to shine, legendarily, heavily refined

Contemporaries like The Roots is so rad, it's like, dag!
Which bag did they come out of?
And how can I get in it to win it?
Like a raffle ticket pickin', if you feelin' stuck
Then guess who did the stickin' of ya feelings, y'all

I got this Ital style up-close and personal
The first I find to violate, I shall retal-iate
With realism for their whole local to relate
We on point like decimal, Abstract, now!

Emceein' while I'm breathin' (Emceein' while I'm breathin')
Emceein' is believin' (Is believin' that what?)
That you can host a ceremony and the dose is never phony
In fact, it's quite therapeutic like a B12 hypodermic needle
So, shoot it!

Lyrically elicit, up steps the explicit most wicked 7-digit mic wizard
My tongue lash out and strike with it, ya slightly might miss it
When I blast through ya section or district to rip it like...


In my formative years, by my peers I was influenced
Until the instruments of time killed the congruence
I peeped the blueprints on how to make true sense
Of MC's which are a nuisance
I know just what to do since I'm on another lev'
Brothers is fakin' jacks and think they ready for the rev'
But they got a lot to learn to make their thoughts long-term
'Cause their short-cuts'll make a wrong turn, probably
Timelessly, I construct the fearsome
To rip ya eardrum for many years to come
Profession-al style, thinkin' rational to move wise
So hard, it's a wonder y'all alive...

... And still breathin', niggas is dead and not even
Perpetratin' real life, this shit kicked is real trife
They fake bleedin', it's obvious that they needin'
Attention feedin', they cold actin' like heathens
When mics is picked up, obscene scenes is kicked up
Like women with the grip up, drinkin' Moët 'til they hiccup
Fellas hustlin', pickin' bricks up
Fantasizin' about the illest stick-up
But rip up the jam and we'll be truly impressed
On stage, you won't need ya tef' vest (What?)
Only a mic and a mic test, and at your best
You get blessed by the fans who profess
That they can relate to the trials you tribulate
Or the pains you endure, 'cause some cats is pure
Tell horrors that are true, but see, cats like you
Y'all fake joints just to get a woo-hoo
The tear jerker, you like a miracle worker
Whose miracles just ran out, I think it's time you pan out
Or just plain fade 'cause, yo, you played

You're physically in this, but how could we tell
If we was meant to be in bliss if you're not mentally as well?
This energy you're sending me is tricky as hell
Usually it's like a 50/50, we could take a L
Before we start things, at this point being apart brings
The feeling of somebody plucking at your heart strings
I know it probably shouldn't feel like this
But any other woman I see is in your likeness
It's from your cheekbones
To your lips, to your curves, to your deep moans
To that walk, to your words
You love feeling like a breakdown on the verge
First we on good terms, then you on my last nerves
Got my back just aching, my shoes is all tight
It's too complex when we choose to do it right
It's wrong, one minute you a soldier strong
Then you trying a route talking about it's over and gone

Trying to figure the cause why you always acting off
Like I'm slacking off
Maybe our signal's getting crossed
For the case Love, you feel like you making a waste of
Your precious time you need to get a taste of
Some space to breathe, a moment as friends
We should've felt ourselves slipping into it again
Cuz it's like off and on, on and off
Passion, lost and found, found and lost
Clashing, asking for nothing but understanding
Your hearts made of glass, use care when handling

Cuz I was kinda too shy to really get down
I used to play the corner and watch the scene
Deep down knowing I wanted to find me a queen
And I could feel that in my stomach and up in my chest
Because I knew a lot of women, and some was fresh
But then I found you girl, and just like me
You had a heart that was yearning to be set free
Now listen, see you and me we need to take the time
To erase any doubt that's inside your mind
It's not a mountain that I'm ever too tired to climb
And who's counting, but I know at least a thousand times
I let you know I'm here for you, care for you, and confide in you
Break bread, share with you, and provide for you
And that's full time, it's no 9 to 5 with you

Bir-thday girl, it's your birthday
Wherever you wanna go
Now you're old enough to go and see the ""R""-rated show, now
""R""-rated show

Yo, she said she was a magazine editor named, Janine
Backstage in high-heels and painted-on, jeans
Probably had the most, devious eyes I'd ever seen
Told me she was twenty-two, she was only seventeen
She had sum'hin to hide she snuck in from out-side
And got, everybody gassed like the car I, drive
With all that grown-lady ass and my far-out, vibe
She said she came to see them Roots boys +Fall-Out+ live, but listen...


You see the girls look good, but they brains not ready
I talk to a woman, her mind is mo', steady
Probably sum'hin in the way they designed, that's mo' steady
I just let you inside cause the line so, heavy
But I shoulda know, better cause now I feel like America's
Underbelly R. Kelly gutter smut peddlers
Internet predators, chat-room irregulars
This not my twist, you tryna send me to the therapist, miss


Now, she told me cheddar cheese grits, two tomato fried fish
Cause she heard it's my dish, tryna be my sidekick
All the people all around thinkin she was my chick
Sayin, ""Damn, the girl thick, but she ain't no twenty-six""
Lookin at me like I'm up to sum'him on the funny tip
Like I ever really been the one to try the honey drip
It's your birthday so let me know the gift you wanna get
In fact, blow out the candles on the cake and make a wish for me

They can't really seem to look away
So they try, asking her to stay
Fake I.D., you won't get turned away!
You look, lovely toniiiight...
Now you're old enough to buy a gun
So many better ways of having fun
Right now I can only think of one...
You look lovely toniiiight...",https://genius.com/The-roots-birthday-girl-lyrics
I Don’t Care,The Tipping Point,2004.0,"I don't care, as long as the bassline's pumpin'
The drumline bangin' away
Make one move and I'll blow you away
One false move and I'll blow you away

Yo, I don't really know but somebody said
That the O.G. flow, it could fuck witcha head
And the po-lice know that the green black and red
Too strong to con-trol, they study what I said
Dig it my name is 'Riq, and when I'm on the mic
I'm known to spit somethin that these MC's hate
I couldn't care less what you feel, what you say
'Cause I gotta put it to you in my own special way
I'm a MONSTER!
You know I'm certified sick
I came from the corner where nobody got shit
Took the cards I was dealt, turned it into hot spit
Now I'm not only a passenger, I'm in the cockpit
Been a long time comin', I was caught in the scramble
Of cats, tryin' to do the same thing that they man do
Eagles born to fly, rivers made to ramble
""A Dangerous Mind"", I'm a prime example


Super-fans wanna run up on me sparkin' the ground up
You need to fall back, could be NARC's around us
You in a hot area for marchin' powder
If you holdin' chowder, just walk without it
Them real crook brothers don't talk about it
They never make a move 'til they thought shit out, kid
I knew a lot of men who did bids for mayhem
They made a lot of money, they money never made them
The game of survival is filled with rivals
Knives and fo'-five slugs flyin' in spirals
The wicked is diseased and it ain't all viral
Could be greed and gluttony bubblin' inside you
Dawg, follow your pride, the rhythm'll guide you
Yo, follow them guys, them niggas'll rob you
And have you up in somethin' that don't really involve you
But you don't give a fuck, you wanna pump the volume, I know


Yo, aiyyo, the waistline thumpin', the face kinda jumpin'
The game lookin' sweeter than a bassline bumpin'
Don't come 'round these parts and waste time frontin'
Them trick-ass marks'll get the eight-five dumpin'
It ain't really 'bout nothin'
Philly just love cuttin'
They shut shit down before the law start shuttin'
Get your route right, cousin
Be out nightclubbin', relaxed
And wanna get lights out tonight brother, perhaps
It's the percussion that keeps shit, kinetic
For some it ain't as fame, more sweet the street credit
Some cats that play dirty didn't live, to regret it
But move to the music, he can live through the record
I'm a Philly boss player, a dope rhyme sayer
It's Black Ink back, gettin' cake by the layer
By the stack, comin' at us, get your weight right, yeah
If not, you makin' a mistake right there, for real",https://genius.com/The-roots-i-dont-care-lyrics
You Got Me (Jill Scott Version),Home Grown: The Beginner’s Guide To Understanding The Roots Volume 1,UnKnown,"If you were worried bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby don't worry you know that you got me
If you were worried bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby don't worry you know that you got me

Somebody told me that this planet was small
We used to live in the same building on the same floor
And never met before until I'm overseas on tour
And peeped this Ethiopian queen from Philly taking classes abroad
She studying film and photo, flash, focus, record
Said she working on a flick and could my clique do the score
She said she loved my show in Paris at Elysee Montmartre
And that I stepped off the stage and took a piece of her heart
We knew from the start that things fall apart, intentions shatter
She like that shit don't matter when I get home get at her
Through letter, phone whatever, let's link, let's get together
Shit you think not, think the Thought went home and forgot
Time passed, we back in Philly now she up in my spot
Telling me the things I'm telling her is making her hot
Starting building with her constantly round the clock
Now she in my world like hip-hop and keep telling me

If you were worried bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby don't worry you know that you got me
If you were worried bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby don't worry you know that you got me

Yo I'm the type that's always catching a flight
And sometimes I gotta be out at the height of the night
And that's when she flip and get on some 'ol

...Another lonely night
Seem like I'm on the side you only loving your mic
I know you gotta get that paper Daddy keep that shit tight
But yo I need some sort of love in my life, you dig me
While politicking with my sister from New York City
She said she know this ball player and he think I'm pretty
Psych, I'm playing boo, you know it's just wit you I'm staying boo
And when cats be popping game I don't hear what they sayin boo
When you out there in the world I'm still your girl
With all my classes I don't have the time for life's thrills
So when you sweating on stage think of me when you rhyme
And don't be listening to your homies, they be leaving you blind

Yeah, so what you sayin I can trust you?

Is you crazy, you my king for real

But sometimes relationships get ill

No doubt


That snake could be that chick and that rat could be that cool cat
That's whispering she trying to play you for the fool Black
If something's on your chest then let it be known
See I'm not at you every five minutes all on the phone
And on the topic of trust, it's just a matter of fact
That people bite back and fracture what's intact
And they'll forever be, I ain't on some oh I'm a celebrity
I deal with the real, so if it's artificial let it be
I've seen people caught in love like whirlwinds
Listening to they squads and listening to girlfriends
That's exactly the point where their whole world ends
Lies come in, that's where that drama begins, and she like",https://genius.com/The-roots-you-got-me-jill-scott-version-lyrics
Long Time,Game Theory,2006.0,"Oooh
It's been a long time
Since I been back around the way
It's been a long time
Let it spin let spin let it spin
Since I been back around your way
It's been a long time
Long time long time

Struck by the luck of the draw
Real life preservation, what I'm hustling for
My name Black Thought, the definition of raw
I was born in South Philly on a cement floor
We had nothing at all, I had to knuckle and brawl
They swore I'd fall or be another brick in the wall
Another life full of love that lost
That's silly, this Philly, y'all really ain't stoppin the bull
With the pen like Willie on top of the hall
Pure soul is what the city most popular for
Hear the tones that will ease you
Smooth as Bunny Sigler's soundtrack
Keepin your head boppin and all
And it's something in the water where I come from
They used to sing it on the corner where I come from
Making somethin outta nothing because everybody fifty cents away
From a quarter where I come from
Yeah the streets ain't timid but I feel at home in it
Gotta see a couple people, I ain't got at in a minute
Yeah, you can take a brother outta South Philly
Can't take it outta him really
I forever represent it

Oooh
It's been a long time
Since I been back around the way
It's been a long time
Let it spin let spin let it spin
Since I been back around your way
It's been a long time
Long time long time

Live and direct, I don't need no mic check
Remember mommy told me ""Peedi, you ain't write that!""
It started in the bathroom taking a dump
Listening to Ultramagnetic ego tripping
 you won't
Question my word, I'm the urban version of you chump
Stomped on a different ground, sound second to none
Synthesizers tweet to improvise your feet
I calculated every lyric to arrive on a beat
It's free, come get high on me
Before a nine millimeter shell hit my pelle pelle in the P
And yeah it's somethin in the water where I come from
They used to sing it on the corner where I come from
Making somethin outta nothing because everybody fifty cents away
From a quarter where I come from
It's just a natural reaction for crack to make it happen
Let the pen ink sink into the paper of the pad
Think back when I was younger
Ghetto could have took me under but
Peedi can't mess with North Philly, never had
You don't know about me, you ain't stroll my streets
Look familiar, I feel ya, long time no see

Oooh
It's been a long time
Since I been back around the way
It's been a long time
Let it spin let spin let it spin
Since I been back around your way
It's been a long time
Long time long time

Clap something but whatever you clap
Clap to the record spinning while I'm taking you back
To the top paper era, baby dig on that
Picture the pool room where the money getters was at
And street people with 
the feathers in the cap of their Borsalino
Pulling paper in as if it's a small casino
I was a young boy sweeping the floors
And runnin to stores
But all those old heads would talk to me though
About the way to clutch the eagle on a buck and tuck
And if I'm down how to get back up
Just survival kid, and it's a struggle worldwide, I'm positive
Shit the ghetto might as well be the Gaza Strip
You know where all of the monsters is
Street walkers, you don't see no consciousness
I'm coming back to where the core of the problem is
We on the job again, y'all know what time it is

Oooh
It's been a long time
Since I been back around the way
It's been a long time
Let it spin let spin let it spin
Since I been back around your way

I the voyeur, peer, as she begins her, ritual
Paying sexual ties for few and untrue
Words of admiration, translation:
Sucker ass, lines, of trash
Spewing from First One's unskilled lips
That beg for pussy tricks that make his dick go quickly limp
She pimps her innocence as Second One demands entrance
Through the back door..
""Bend over bitch, you know this is what you were born for;
To dig those soft and lotioned knees into the floor --
And take it in, that sweetly spread ass like a real pro whore""
Her subsequent screams seemed to praise
Sent messages of pleasure and pain to his fuck tainted brain
But her screams masked laughs at his dumb ass
As he quicker comes, then Third and Fourth One just as dumb
Invite themselves to join in
Third One wants to hit the skins old-fashioned style
While Fourth One says
""Don't she got some DSL's, make a nigga joint just swell
To think? I wanna sink my inches, into that bitch's
Berry-framed mouth""
So one goes North, the other South
To sanctified places where in-house spirits
Will later wash away all traces, of their ill-spoken words
And complacent faces
And then, like their Minutemen, predecessors
Lude, aggrandized sexual endeavors, end up rough
Cause neither one of them could keep that weak shit up
Corrupt, Fifth One steps to her
Hip-Hop clothed just to, think he gonna impress her
""Hey Slim, I heard you was a spinna -- sit on up
Top this thing, black dick, and work it like a winner""
With the quickness he got his pseudo-thickness all up in her
But suddenly he, stops mid thrust
*Yvette Smalls' pager goes off*
Seems she nameless to cuz, got his stuff in a death cunt clutch
He fast falls from the force of her tight pussy punch
Just like the rest of that sorry ass bunch
Now here comes Six ready to add his inactive shit to the mix
Talkin smack at that
Saying, ""Girl, I'mma wax that ass, and stick that slit so hard
You gonna be calling me God""
So he proceeds to poke and prod
With clumsy finger and wack sex slinger
""Condoms make me last longer,"" wrong, cause her
Motions of snatch, however detached from the situation
Cause his pre pre PRE-ejaculation
It seems she just wastin
Good pussy and time on dudes like Number Seven
Who ain't learned their lesson
He wants to enter the flesh divine
By dropping a kind of semi-sweet line
""Your honey hole so fine and mile deep; I'm gonna leap
Into you like an ocean do you right and make your head spin""
So he jumped in and then, he drowned
Got lost and found in her Tart Canal
Slave to the waves, made him cum for days
Eighth and last One turn arise
Plys her with familiar lies
Even more familiar still, cause
Him she used to love
But he never could quite see above, her mound
A pound of flesh is all she was, no name no face or even voice
So poised, she rises -- Phoenix from the flame
Finally bored with their feeble fuck games
She smooth reaches behind her and takes straight aim
At eight shriveled up cocks with a fully loaded Glock
Parts lips, not expressly made for milking dicks
And then, she speaks:
Your shreiks of horror bring me bliss, I must admit
The thought that I could shred your tips with eight quick flips
Excites me, see y'all fuck with the pussy
But I fuck with your minds
Lack of soul and respect is the crime
This.. was a set up.. now tell me what..... what's my name?

I Remain Calm,Do You Want More?!!!??!,1995.0,"I remain calm, lyrically, I got the bomb
When you put me on, I remain calm

It's the 'I Remain Calm', but for jerks that erk
Come out my humble, go berzerk
And make you swallow your smirk
I splurge most and bash, capacities mass
I fascinate as I assassinate and show task
Characters and egos get crushed in trust
And my words stampede like herds in the dusk
Cream of all crops, topics I drop with Trotter
When heated up, I gets hotter 'cause I'm proper
You never knew the levitude the clever few
Different tax for revenue, man, if you ever knew
The tac-tic, strategies of word ca-pa-bil-ities, display, decease
The rhythm, and man, how it swerved and curved
Made a nigga's dream but his hope deferred and stirred
Dig the mentals, Papermate, Bic's and No. 2 pencils
My credentials flow on instrumentals
I write an anthem, throw a tantrum and remain handsome
Mysterious vibes like I was The Phantom
Erupt abruptly, then conduct, amaze
You're fucked when the lyrics get buck because I graze
Never animosity, on my property
Niggas acropoly, or they feel extreme monstrosity
Wreak and leak out the verbals, Akhi, don't forget it
The chief of edit, the Malik'll shred it, yeah, I said it!

I remain calm, lyrically, I got the bomb
When you put me on, I remain calm

That nigga Thought flows like a river, I deliver styles like Domino's
Eyes closed, I inhale equality, follow me now, son
Listen, my divisions advance, I surpass one half of the rap mass
The other half want my autograph
Because I got soul, plus a ghetto stroll similar to Shaft
It's the mic rapers, splittin' Phillies in the cellar
My a capella verse can stomp, I delete comp
My rated-X larynx wrecks your context
I'm complex, confusin', lyrically amusin'
I drink brews then when I'm groovin', I'm no longer human
I'd like to take this time to give a shout to all the money makers
In the house galore, they help me turn it out
I whip the cap to the back, I'm laid back like your gramps
I make niggas embarrassed like they spendin' food stamps
I take my time when I rhyme lovely, me, nah like ugly
Like, God, we get odd to ill rhythms
Rappers thinkin' of steppin' up, what the fuck you doin?
I amplify the hymn to bring your empire to ruin
Who's your girl screwin', fellas? Jealous because I'm fly?
Keep my sneakers dry when you cry-baby
See, I can have you headin' for the border like a refugee from Haiti
Aiyyo, this brother drivin' my cab tried to flip
Sayin', ""Pay me in advance"" - I asked him if he ever danced
In the dark with the rap devil Black Thought
See, niggas who get caught off guard remain scarred
Into air, with headphones remainin' on they domes, they hear
I resound and astound and scare
I reign terror into another nigga rap era
My rhymes sedate, I lubricate like Aloe Vera
I'm extreme, restin' in the land of the plot and the scheme
Peace to Bed, Shedroch and the Equal Team

A sacrifice is what I made for the wife and kids
They say life's a bitch, 
but it's one life to live
I want my baby where that cake and the icing is
Out of them crisis-es, off of them vices-es
They see what we do and grow up in our likenesses
Really I don't wanna see em having to fight for this
Story of the family biz, I'ma rewrite the script
Daughter of a hip-hopper, hustla like her grandpoppa
Her destiny done been determined so you can't stop her
From being independent, earning paper and proper
More like a lawyer or a doctor, not a man-watcher
That's where your man got ya, it's a big world out'chea
I'm tryna make a black diamond or a pearl out'chea
And hip the people to the way the world twirl out'chea
And when I thank heaven for my little girl

Please let her be a hustla, baby be a hustla
Hope my baby girl grows up to be a hustla
Better be a hustla, baby be a hustla
If not, then you're only a customer
Please let him be a hustla, baby be a hustla
Hope my baby boy grows up to be a hustla
Better be a hustla, baby be a hustla
If not, then you're only a customer

Sugar Slim, I'm slicker than a squid, nigga no kids
No baby mama, Sugar free from the drama
Sugar be where he wanna, 
no sweat like a sauna
No judge, Your Honor can't tell me to raise mine

True love, Buddha

maybe you can blue-line

G, I'm all about the green like tree pines
See I'm tryna get the scratch like a feline
Hopin' that my seed don't know the struggle like me, I'm
Hustlin' to make a buck, make a buck and fuck it up
Fuck it up and suck it up then go and make another buck
Get the money, get the money, that's what I know
I'm hopin' that my seeds know a little more than I know
I know, I know, but baby this what I know
If we ever settle down, well baby, this what I hope

Please let her be a hustla, baby be a hustla

"The Lesson, Pt. 1",Do You Want More?!!!??!,1995.0,"Lyrically versatile, my rap definition is wild
I wrote graffiti as a juvenile
Restin' on deuce trey and used to boost gray Kangol's
With 555 Souls from the streets of the Illadelph-iadic insane
For monetary gain, niggas is slain on the train
It's homicide for wealth, stealth missions for crack
In the alleyways where niggas get grazed in the back
From stray shots, clips with hollow tips, for your spine
Or either remain calm, catch a rhyme to your mind
Niggas, ya know my style
I run a-motherfuckin-rap-mok with Malik in a U-Haul truck
I stand 5'7"", in command of the party and scam like Uncle Sam
I'm never caught up in the glass eye of your action cam
'Cause I'm down low, artistic, exquisite rap pro that get the dough
It's the Philly borough dread thoroughbred for dolo
I bag solo, like a nigga that boost Polo
Steppin' through the corridor of metaphors
Lookin' over my left shoulder, the mic still feel colder than before
With this jazz shit, I hit your jaw
Dice Raw, get up on the mic, my young poor
I be the nigga blowin' up the spot on tour
Surely real to the core, old school like '84
I never die, and raps 'til my lungs collapse
Then relax until my knack for tracks bring it back
On time, when I rhyme my rep remain
Either go against the grain or your ass is found slain
I overcome, niggas want styles, then I throw you some
Show you some, get on the mic and take it over, son
Dice Raw, the motherfuckin' Wild Noid
Get on the mic and perpetrate in this void

I leave niggas missin' in action like their dads in the projects
My style like an nomad
, travel 'round and catch wreck
I'm ill versatile with the skill, no more
Wack MC's wanna flex but their styles, they bore
Got to know the real meanin' of the ill shit, kid
I do mad damage but never will catch a bid
With my knapsack, full of ill shit that I just boosted
From the corner store when I let loose more
Flavor that's me, rippin' heads off from the seams
Niggas didn't play like Jeru and Come Clean
 I beat down on they heads like drum machines
Or 808's 'cause my style flows out great
And super spectac' with all the raw rap
Pull a metal chair out my knapsack across your back ka-crack
Now do you feel the pain? Of course
I guess you're believin' that I'm insane
When I'm taggin' my name upon the train, I got so much pride
I got so much soul, with lyrics hot
To make niggas stop, drop and roll
Now, check me out one time for your ass
Fat styles equivalent of an AIDS infected Glock blast
Niggas know my style, plus they know they want more
Props from Mount Vernon to Mount Rushmore
Ok, kid, you know my style is buckwild literature
That you can never get when I'm thinkin' your particular
Flavor that you want
I sit back and smoke a fat blunt in class
Teachers can kiss my ass, I'm twice, Dice Riggety Raw
Never take a bad fall, smack your head up against the wall
Like playin' handball, my style's ill
I slam like Hulk Hogan, Dice Raw bettin' on my arm
Niggas know my slogan while I breathe your last breath
Niggas better watch they step, fat bull catch wreck
Ill, gots ta keep you in check
With the hellified beats and hard rhymes
Niggas know my style, when I go the whole nine
I beat down punks, cut 'em up into fruit chunks
Like fruit salad, my style's smooth like Malik
Blunts, so whatcha want? If you got beef then come get it
If ya don't well then forget it
My rap style's exquisite, I'm Raw Daddy
Like niggas with no Trojans on the stage when I rhyme
I gots ta keep my composure
Where I'm from, it's like a whole different world
Hoppin' a train, honey-dip and I'mma snatch your squirrel
Most corrupt, motherfucker in the tenth grade
Juvenile 'cause Jeff McKay could not fade
Don't ask me, honey, I'm not the one for stressin'
If you wanna know, better ask Brother ?uestion

Go where you want or go and see all you wanna see
Because yo, your ambitions I won't neglect
And to the brothers who ain't here, nuff respect
So BROther ?uest, how ya livin, what ya givin black?
To me the brother with the linens and the applejack;
Busy til the break of dawn
The first verse is poured I pass the popcorn

* in background: ""Pass the what? (Pass the popcorn)"" 4x *
It looks like another one comin' around
It looks like another one comin' around
It looks like another one comin' around
So the Black Thought had to get down y'all, yeah
* in background: ""Pass the what? (Pass the popcorn)"" 4x *
It looks like another one comin' around
It looks like another one comin' around
It looks like another one comin' around
?uestion, would you come and get down? Bust it, c'mon

Check it out, secondly
It's me, the BROther ?uest from the S-Q-T (Square Roots)
And he's Black Thought, the boy you know is (FUNKY)
The rhythms I recycle sometimes prehistoric
The mic for the popcorn's like it's metaphoric (Metaphoric, baby)
So many different factors in the ?uestion's style
A rhythmic father and I'm givin' more than one child
Abstract soloist drummin' from the heart
All the way from Philly, from the West part
Relax your mind and let your body be at rest
Flow in slow mo', and let the BROther manifest
Now the second verse has been born
On to Kid Crumb I pass the popcorn
* in background: ""Pass the what? (Pass the popcorn)"" 4X *

It looks like another one comin' around
It looks like another one comin' around
It looks like another one comin' around
?uestion ripped the set and got down baby, yeah
* in background: ""Pass the what? (Pass the popcorn)"" 4x *
It looks like another one comin' around
It looks like another one comin' around
It looks like another one comin' around
Kid Crumbs, would you come and get down? C'mon

Blessed is the next at the second, still before the 4th is passed
I'm gassed off the edible raps, and that's illegible
Tommy used to bug, when I come around
Screamin' at the top of my lungs ""You gots to get down""
Now, they heard the sound
And wanna give the kid a pound on the down low
(Relax, baby, keep it underground, yo)
From the crown of knotty hair that I wear to the funk feet
Wonder why the sisters dig the brother missin' five teeth?
Peace, I gots to rock so pass the popcorn and shit
Quick to lick a shot to, umm, Wheezy, and Cricket
Used to kick it in the house until I got myself evicted
Now The Crumbs is restricted to the popcorn
Elected from The Roots
I griff the rest and share the stash of popcorn
Back to Black Thought, rock on (and on)
And on (and on) and on (and on)
And on (and onnnnnn), pass the popcorn!
* in background: ""Pass the what? (Pass the popcorn)"" 4X *

It looks like another one comin' around
It looks like another one comin' around
It looks like another one comin' around
Kid Crumbs ripped the set and got down, baby pah!
* in background: ""Pass the what? (Pass the popcorn)"" 4X *
It looks like another one comin' around
It looks like another one comin' around
It looks like another one comin' around
Black Thought, you know I gotta get down, bust it, yo

Honey, glazed, amazed at the art Black Thought displays
I get mad props and the compliment pays
Makin' me more funky and it shows on stage
Word right BROther 'cause I'm goin' through a phase
I wanna be a pioneer so trails I blaze
Straight past the days when I used to be enslaved
But don't eat all the popcorn BROther ?uest (What?)
Yo, BROther ?uest, say it
A bit for my hit makin' it legitimate and give
Credit to the attitude you set it don't forget
Well, it's gotta be live, 'cause that's the way I'm rockin it and
Pop-corn is in my pocket then I guess it's rockin', yo
The S-Q-T'n, Black Thought of seein'
I know you're all agreein', I'm rockin' and I'm bein'
Rippin' another chapter, just for you to clap ta
To the sounds I maxed, I make you step just like a camper
I pass the popcorn, lyrics I drop on the mic
Gon' have you hummin' my song, all the way home
It's cool and as long, as you and the song, be mellowin' out
Together 'cause it's kind of peace, I'm not embarrassed
As I pass the popcorn, and get off the dome
Yo, BROther ?uestion, yo, Rubber Bandz, Square Roots
Take it home
* in background: ""Pass the what? (Pass the popcorn)"" 4x *

Another one's comin around
It looks like another one's comin' around
It looks like another one's comin' around

Panic!!!!!,Illadelph Halflife,1996.0,"I woke up in the darkness at 12:17...to shots and sirens
Look out the window, peep the high beams
Now they searchin, the cops lookin for the person
That pulled the trigger
Medical figures is nursin the kid that got shot
Some innocent ak that would front
To flip the rock on them at McKean Street block
I tried to tell him to stop cuz yo, it's ghetto red hot
Similar to the blood now floodin his top
I take a step out the spot, to the point of attack
And see the shorty wop heart blast out his back
Damn, I'm thinkin it don't cease, it's no more peace
Police level increase, but what the fuck...
It's still crime on the streets
I can't breathe, now what's goin on?
One minute you alive, the next, you're gone
Illadel-P-H-I-A Hell
Bust off into the heavens for the nigga who fell
And hit the L, for the niggas who fell
When that could have been prevented
In front of the flat your moms rented
And no one expect that from you, cuz you was timid
Fuckin with them cats from outside city limits
Funny how this whole thing changed, an off minute
Yo, dig it, Panic!!!!!

I Will Not Apologize,Rising Down,2008.0,"I will not apologize, I will not apologize
I will not apologize, I will not apologize
This is for all of my peoples who understand and truly recognize
Some won't get it and for that, I won't apologize
I will not apologize, I will not apologize
I will not apologize, I will not apologize
This for all of my peoples who understand and truly recognize
Some won't get it and for that, I won't apologize

I'm so sick cause I'm infected but, but I don't need a medic
Need a liquid anesthetic, let me show you how I get it
I don't got it but I bet it, I don't worry, I don't sweat it
You can bitch, you can dead it, you can take it there like FedEx
Nothing sweet, diabetic, big dog, can't pet it
Pack an L then I wet it, then I fill it 'til it's pregnant
(Take the high back) Face it, everybody got a favorite
I embrace it like I date it but my grandma think I chase it
(Like oh yeah) I told her that her baby moving slower
Cause the world is on his shoulders then I woke up out that coma
(And got right back) At it with a little black 'matic
Lay you down, Craftmatic, then I'm gone, black magic
(To the hideout) You don't wanna gamble with the devil
Especially when them chewy blueys got me on another level
Cause my teacher think I'm slow but my momma think I'm special
But even she know I'm coming back like an echo

For the statements I'm about to make, I will not apologize
Niggas talk a lot of shit, really need to stop the lies
Jewels rented, cars rented, homie that ain't authentic
Acting tough on TV, but to me you seem a little timid
Don't blame the nigga, blame America, it's all business
Acting like a monkey is the only way to sell tickets
Shit, I can dig it, niggas gossip silly digits
White kids buy it, it's a riot when we talking about pimping
Or sipping on Olde English brew or whatever they think we do
Spraying double Uzis cause you know they think we live in zoos
The problem is with this, everyone seems to be real confused
The niggas on the streets to the old people that watch the news
And watch BET, and the crazy shit they see
They associate with you and do the same shit to me
When you look at me, you see just a nigga from the projects
But can't understand this nigga's mindset, but still

I will not apologize, I will not apologize
I will not apologize, I will not apologize
This is for all of my peoples who understand and truly recognize
Some won't get it and for that, I won't apologize

I will not apologize, I will not apologize
This for all of my peoples who understand and truly recognize
Some won't get it and for that, I won't apologize

Yo, a revolution's what it's smelling like, it ain't gon' be televised
Governments is hellified, taking cake and selling pies
I ain't got a crust or crumb, to get some I'd be well obliged
Murder is commodified, felon for the second time
Never was I into chasing trouble I was followed by
Facing trouble with no alibi, had to swallow pride
Vilified, victimized, penalized, criticized
Ran into some people that's surprised I was still alive
Look into my daughter's eyes, wonder how can I provide
Got to get from A to B but how can I afford to drive?
Messed around, tried to get a job and wasn't qualified
Had to see a pal of mine, got to get the lightning rod
Now I'm in a black Impala looking for the dollar sign
Palms get to itching, man I gotta get the calamine
'Fore I fall behind, guess the grind will be my 9 to 5
I will not be conquered by, I will not apologize

I will not apologize, I will not apologize
I will not apologize, I will not apologize
This is for all of my peoples who understand and truly recognize
Some won't get it and for that, I won't apologize

Lazy Afternoon,Do You Want More?!!!??!,1995.0,"(Everybody, wake up!)

It's a lazy afternoon
(Summertime, as I recline, lay back and relax, let the sun shine)

Consider this a message to my mellow in the front seat
Of the Jeep, pumpin' beats for your rump
In the summertime, I'm risin' to the shine at 12:20
Ghetto streets is sunny, niggas is gettin' money
It's mad hot, and what I got to do, I'm not sure of
I call up Maura, this dip I know from Bora Bora
Was rappin' for a second about what I reckoned that I
Was doin' at six, she was invitin' me to the flicks
That I'm with, blew a kiss, click, now I'm in the shower
I meant the bath in which I simmer for half an hour
Then got drier, put on attire to inspire
Hit my dresser for numbers of women that I admire
Laid around and lounged 'til around two
Then I got up and ate, drank a brew
And caught a page from the crew
Sayin', ""Where ya at? Later, meet us up at the Plat
Bring a sack, ayo, it's Saturday, it's gonna be phat""
Now, it's 3:37 and I still ain't left the rest
Electric Relaxation from A Tribe Called Quest
With the boom, tokin', smokin', coolin' out as I parlay in my room
'Cause it's a lazy afternoon

Verses 2 and 3 the same as verse 1, with the following alterations
:
Verse 2: ""this dip I knew from Bora Bora""
""'Cause it's a lazy aaaaaahh!""
Verse 3: ""click, I'm in the shower""
""a page from my crew""

Bread and Butter,Game Theory,2006.0,"Yeah, through the sirens, the lights is blinding
Battle cries sound off, warriors dying
Last call at the bar for snakes and tyrants
Hands up, that's a massacre the cops kept firing
Run amok, keep y'all eternally crying
Fed up, place red stains on global giants
The brain of an Orson Welles
Stuck in a masterpiece, Citizen Kane's personal hell
It's done, and it's hot where them hustlers dwell
And the air bears the stench of a corpse's smell
Homie down on his luck one foot in the jail
And he down to his last with a quarter to sell
This right here, world premiere of the last days
The final paragraphs to the book's last page
You could feel it coming, no running away
Let's get free or let's get paid
Same shit different day
The cornerstone to where I lay
It's shattered glass and crack bags where they play
And scattered ass is passed in ridiculous ways
These cats Chef like they Isaac Hayes
Parallel to the grave
Stuck in the game with no rules
And we screaming for some water and some edible food
Man I'm right there, rabbit ears, nothing to lose
This is what you ain't learning in school
I'm trying to tell you it's hard

A loaf of bread, milk and eggs, stick of butter man
Somebody's mother lies dead in the gutter
Sheriff down by them heads, talking that Gullah
Tell the kids don't look under those covers, man 

Check it out
A child is born, his mother is gone
He in the middle of it literally, tussling strong
For his life, the tide high in the eye of the storm
A mannish boy arrive and the riot is on
With no spare time to try to respond
Or prepare times, it's hard not becoming a headline
Or praying in the night when it's bedtime
Or laying your head down
Cuz you already know what it is now
You know a lot of leaders ain't honest
And they can't keep a promise
And I hate to speak about it but it's all freakanomics
Cramped and proud of it, you amped and you rowdy
Treading water trying to lift up your head without drowning
This type of shit can make your heart stop pounding
But you pushing for the top, too scared to stop
Now it gets deep, bodies are floating around in the streets
Lot of people who won't even be around in a week
Man, get the operation gone, what y'all waiting on?
We been patient, y'all mo'fuckas taking long
The television getting all the information wrong
Doing how they do it getting they mis-education on
They already late
Somebody been was 'posed to regulate
Instead of wait before they let the levee break
You try running from the truth but it's giving chase
I got to ask myself,yo, is any nigga safe?",https://genius.com/The-roots-bread-and-butter-lyrics
The ’Notic,Men in Black - The Album ,UnKnown,"This beautiful blend, I knew her through a mutual friend
She was a work of art, a part of my heart from back then
A brown skin singer with a knack for actin'
Alana's whole attraction just fractionally based on surface
I got into her mental on purpose
And with alertness, as I flirt with her emotion
Walls we built up out of nervousness was broken
I reminisce on how this Black Thought had her open
With the energy that got the whole summertime smokin'
Very hypnotized, when it was time, we spent time
It's no way to rewind or prevent time from slippin' away like day
Into the dark and the way that Things Fall Apart
Will make some start to feel more weak or insecure
But for whatever reason, our relationship remain mature
Even when she caught feelings 'cause I stay on tour
As I reflect on before and recap the situation
I guess from experience comes education
We set on a path to opposite destinations
It's best to chalk it up and add it to the elevation
Then, eventually flow on to lost communication
I called but lost all information
And with time, forgot it, it's not like I'm all in tears about it
But the fact of the matter remains that I miss The Hypnotic

You're a shinin' star
No matter where you are
For the world to see
What you truly be

Yo, she was The Hypnotic and potent as a narcotic
The bizarre logic of it all, is while the clock tick
Pages of the calendar flip, we can't stop it
Time will either tell the tale or turn a love toxic
Now, was she real? Or an illusion of this optical
Confusion with the accent of Ancient Egypt?
Or could it be that she's the one I was supposed to be with
And together walk this twisted staircase to somethin' realistic?
Damn, her lips havin' me addicted to her presence
Front page material on Essence
A queen, imperial before her adolescence
And as she grew into a woman, she became refined
I never knew another like her in my lifetime
So, now I travel through a tunnel of space without a place
On the face of this Earth, with this pain gettin' worse
Drivin' me insane, or at least, I'm touchin' the brink of sanity
To think of how I can link or contact her
I was a fool before, but more wise after the fact
I'm analyzin' how I'm wantin' her back
And wonderin' exactly where she could be on the map
I'm just sittin' here, spinnin' the world on one finger
Reoccurrin' thoughts of this brown skin singer
Yo, the psychotic, The Hypnotic
Yo, check it out, the most melodic Hypnotic, yeah",https://genius.com/The-roots-the-notic-lyrics

Tonight (cheeba cheeba yo, soul shock yo)
(Give it everything you got yo)
(Once again it's time, it's time)
It's time to ride, ride....

Yo, piss in the staircase, blood on the pavement
I fill the quills with it let it spill on the pages
Compose another anthem for the killers and manglers
Villains and wranglers, fifth still in the chamber
Shit, I'm scientific but my reflex's gangsta
Pull out-rageous arms from the floor of the basement
Then bust 'nuff talons if my peoplez in danger
I'm Larry Davis, duckin' helicopter, hoverin' government agents
We muscle the language
What we spit will leave your shit in utter amazement
I'm hot brolic call it contagious
The shit the Roots started got these other artists going through changes
My vision is the strangest, the rhythm is anguish
Y'all niggas on the titty in your formative stages
Is something in the iris and the way I spit
That tell these other crab rappers I ain't fo' no shit
Black traumatic, so there you have it
My battin' average, abort full of graphic assault, it's all classic
Thought, put ass-backwards rappers in a small package
Experience is all that is, I'm well established
Me and the mic in holy matrimony like a marriage
The technique in your reach, if only you could have it
For me it's automatic, it's na-tu-ral, I'm mad thoro
Poet for hired pack metal
You feel me?


Yo, the load heavy
We walk around a little edgy, all ready and steady
Withdrawal like Darryl Strawberry, it figures
Niggas mad from them ghetto sandwiches and swine
Cryin' hard times, disadvantegeous, man listen
The story in the ghetto the same
Seem like it's just some things that never will change
Give birth to a style and won't give it a name
Talk 'bout consciousness it's a different thang
Envision a king, the honorable 'Riq, general Hannibal speak
The understandable diabolique, animal style
Out of your dreams kid, you proud that you seen this
Fifth supreme linguist, a lyrical genious
Inject you with the broke down english
The most freshest and cleanest, 'Riq Geez, guess what the theme is
Kareem's beat makin' me fiendish
Don't act shaky and squeamish, if you real make me believe it nigga


Yo, the rebel Che Gueverra
You heard another debut better?
Don’t cop Thought’s Theatre, just save your cheddar
I hit the studio with a pen and a vendetta
Sippin' an ice cold Beck, huffin' the tenth letter
Driftin', shots lickin while the plot thickens
Sands in the hourglass thinnin', the last inning
The flash and the cash and the fast women
It's nothing, a lust for the crabs keep the passion and
Blaow, kissin' my tablet with firing pins
Poke holes in the plastic for oxygen
MCs jumpin' out shoes and socks again
Must have seen their face in the news it's gots to been 
Thought known as the cure for cancer
Same corrupt city as Mumia the Panther
Man to man, hammer cocked, block and standoff
Bang, gunfire slang up in the dance hall
Yo, I hold the mic that could be thrown as a pipe bomb
Bring it just to sling it at your favorite icon
Thing about my music is it ain't shit like y'all
Thought, diesel like a 28-inch python
You know what I'm saying?
When I'm on the mic there won't be no delayin...",https://genius.com/The-roots-quills-lyrics

This is the BROther ?uestion, broadcastin' live
Via satellite from the Never Never Tunnels
Now dig, the rituals for today is good music
So, sit back, relax and dig the groove

Yo, bust it, I digs hip-hop, and rocks the hip-hop
Not R&B because to me, that's not my style and
The R-double-O-quotes ain't for radio, but major soul
The ones that's hip won't change the dial and
I remember one mornin' at the Soul Shack
Coolin' in the outback, on the slow ridin' ship
Blaze a five off a Bob Marley spliff
On the cloud, I be relaxin' from last night and shit
In studio today, but hey BROther ?uestion
Was on the West Side, asleep without a clue when
I hollered down to Crumbs to pick up the phone
And tell him to get ready (?uestion, what ya doin?)
(Ain't no thing) but a chicken wing, so I met him in the West
Where we had to 'lax and wait for Rubber Band and Bas'
Bassey broke down on the other side of town
Yo, you know what it's about, The Roots is out, to the subway

Does anybody like real music? Sweet music, soul music?
You know The Roots is a group that'll choose it
Just to use it, to make you move it, yeah

From the subway to the studio
Gots to break fast if we wanna get to the bus
Runnin' like a Mex' for the border
(Umm, yo, oh umm, was it a bunch of ya's?)
Nah, just the four of us
'Nuff nappy sweets on the transit, two fine
(Three fine) fo' fine, mo' fine, UHH!
A girl says, ""Hey, ain't y'all The Square Roots?""
And I'm like, ""Heh, word""
And then the shorty passed the sign
Now, we got to make our exit (Where?)
To the pavement (To what?), to crush a trail mix
(Oh, word man, yo, look out) Say what? (Look out!)
?uestion dropped a whole bag of drumsticks
(Ain't no thing, haha), but a chicken wing, so
He bends down to pick up the sticks
And his pants fall down (Dang!)
In my face, ?uestion didn't frown, turned around
And thought he felt a draft, so I laughed
(Hahahahaha!)


Here comes the Crumbs from the chums of the P.O
Sprouted from The Roots and I was added to the trio
Now, I'm in cahoots and got a reason for my ego
In the words of Los Lobos; adios amigo

At the Rat Cave, mic in hand, I'm flowin'
Tellin' ?uestion to keep it goin'
What I'm doin', I'm not really knowin'
But umm, to me, see, it sounds oh-and-kay'n (It sounds OK)
Layin' to the sounds playin'
Umm, hi-to-ho-'n, yeah, hey to hay-'n (Uh-huh)
Trippin', I'm tryin' not to laugh, bust it

Aiyyo y'all rappers less played, what I'm about to say
Will probably hit y'all niggas in a real strange way
Shmucks, ducks and half hearted prankster crews
Willie dank Langston Hughes, put shanks in crews
I debut to make the news and I've been killing it since
Still in the trench, buzzin off the chillest suspense
I want my niggas out that barbwire still in the fence
Verbal assassin I'm a killer still in a sense
Rhymes is graphic
Aimin straight at your minds and blast that weak shit
The pieces and particles of fragments
Mad vocabulist, yes I must confess
I'm like Diddy tryin to sink a slug in Elliots chest
Just taste on that it's Black you can tell he a vet
You never knew that fate cut you until your belly was wet
New Delian cat the Fraggle Rock skully is split
It's Black coming, you can tell it's a hit
Comin to drop you nigga

We will rock you, we will rock you
We will rock you, we will rock you
We will rock you, we will rock you

Yo yall savages is primitive, I'm true penmanship
Here come the neuro-linguistic rap hypnotist
Making sound waves, prisoners outta the listeners
Legendary magnificent dope distributors
Man, I remain miles ahead of the game
Slang play off the meter cause it's never the same
Niggas tell me how they never comin better than plain
They love what I say, here come the rebel breaking the frame
And the charts too, my earning bars arts is martial
I'm comin to off you, I ain't tryin to argue
When you least expect it I'm gonna step out the darkroom
Pull out the hardware tools the particles will spark you
My niggas wraps give a slice, I spit nice
Fucking around this twice as much as rhythm is rolling a dice
To choose one the noose or the gun
Cause you're getting banged or hanged, Thought second to none
Nigga

We will rock you, we will rock you
We will rock you, we will rock you
We will rock you, we will rock you

Yo check it out whether you ballin or just on the
Wall and groovin groovin
We've come to get it kickin and get the movement movin
For Tracey and Tamika and for Shelly and Susan
Styles make you wonder what the hell he was usin
Remember your development with melanin music
Spit so many spears it's becoming a nuisance to some
But to whoever want to know who the truth is
You never heard another on the mic as ruthless
I drink a little liquor a lot of water and juices
It make money ain't no need for makin excuses
Burn you fuckin with a South Philly exclusive
Them long dick niggas with real short fuses that go off
Chick likes Riq, you such a show off
You cut your locks down to a fro then cut your fro off
I been at your show there ain't no way to cut your flow off
You got to be the illest emcee that people know of word

I will rock you
I will rock you

We will rock you, we will rock you
We will rock you, we will rock you
We will rock you, we will rock you",https://genius.com/The-roots-rock-you-lyrics

Mind of a dentist, crimes of a menace
Press rewind, see what you find in my image
Take you niggas back to the line of the scrimmage

Talk's cheap, that's why we speak with the dough
Ill technique show I'm sleek with the flow
It's cold outside, nigga sleep with the snow

Lost all semblance of hope, so now, I'm left with
Nervous conditions, addictions
In addition to vixens that mixed in with the wrong crowd
My life is on a flight that's goin' down
My mother had an abortion for the wrong child
Well, the time I felt love, that's gone now
Been replaced by purple rains and some storm clouds
Misery love misery
So why make friends? Let's make some enemies
And now, I got a habit that wasn't meant for me
Now, I'm in a marriage that wasn't meant to be

I’m Just A Slave,Golden Globes,2017.0,"I am a slave
Yes, I'm only a slave
They'll place my body in an unmarked grave
In these confederate days
It's kinda hard to lift every voice singing
While worrying about how low the sweet chariots are swinging
I could swing from a tree, but hey
Oh, I hope and pray they don't kill me today
I am still just a slave

I am a slave
In the home of the brave
A product of the triangular trade
Please pardon my ways
If I'm nervous or the slightest bit skittish
In the presence of the Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch, or British
They kept me in colonial chains
Tell me how to persuade them to chill
Or to save me and still I'm a slave
Oh, I hope and pray they don't kill me today

With tension runnin deep as the ocean
Many are called, but so few are chosen
As I go through the motions, of medication uppin my dosage
Bangin Earth, Wind & Fire ""Devotion"" as I admire the focus
Takin the city with a grain of salt
Where they tastin foul, chase it down, with the latest malt - liquor
Roll and hit it, knife did it, hope you got some smarts wit'chu
Hope you got some heart it ain't no stoppin when it start - nigga
Feel somethin bigger got a hold on me
And I ain't trippin not a Bobby Brown, lippin with my nose runnin
Basically I had two, options I just chose one
And then got ghost, like my picture was on a most wanted
Coast to coast, from L.A. to Chicago
Now I'm faced, with the weight of survival, plus the taste
From the way I been lied to while the preacherman spittin his gospel
I can win if I try to

Rolling With Heat,Phrenology,2002.0,"Downtown everybody move to the beat
Uptown everybody moving the heat
Cross-town the party where both sides meet
Eastside, westside, there's always beef

I tattoo the page with the permanent ink
Mr. Rourke on your Fantasy Island
The umbrella in your tropical drinks
Still run it up it, liquor in your cup
Fucking you up
Hang over the banister
You feel the rush of the blood going straight to your brain
Ain't no love, you only love bringing hate to the game
Taking my name in vain, mistaking license for freedom
He make music for the people, people dying to meet him
People!
We still abuse it while the richest man in music
He probably driving a Buick and be rockin' Van Heusen
G-U-E relevant, see how his man do it
Fucking with niggas from illa fifth, see how we ran through it
The river in the valley
The nigga in the alley
Rolling with the heat from BK to killer Cali
The hands will fake the clapping
You'll be collasping
You softer than Land-o-lakes
Transforming the landscape
Like a sandstorm in the Sahara
I am the truest nigga
I do more shows than The Roots to Carol Lewis
Creative artist, never play the targets of game hunters
You may want to test this product like cane smugglers
Dis disco shit
Popping like Crisco
Hitting your face
Spit in your face like pistol shit
My style, wild like wipple whip
I go back like a pistol grip
It's pro-black, Kweli!

Downtown everybody move to the beat
Uptown everybody moving the heat
Cross-town the party where both sides meet
Eastside, westside, there's always beef

I’m a threat like Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
Willy gank, spit the killer dank dialogue
Pyro-maniac like Dr. Molotov
I knock the bottle off
And knock the model off
Gots some non-believers here
Some how I'll save y'all
Or stop y'all worries, you makin me vexed
Hit up gekko, this ain't got gold correct
I'll fucking bounty hunt your body like I'm Boba Fett
Cause you a toy not a soldier yet
You better hold your neck
You dick smokers get no respect
With the blood, ice your watch, rock your rocks
Better rock it on the screen and not the blocks
Cuz them crews don't stop them shots
It's so many that fly, they chase down, I just stop and watch
I'm from the south side of philly, it's known to get gruesome
Heavy hitter villians these alleyways produce them
Heavy hitter on a pocket we find a way to juice them
They may as well pay, schmuck
Introducing the B-to L-A see me the king splitter
Then analyze this dime, the main thing glitter
Then analyze the taste in your mouth, it seem bitter
Ganster, valedictorian, graduate of I dare you
If you are paper thin I'm a tear you
I'm a come take care of you put a part in your hairdo
You barking like I'm a starting to scare you
But speak up like a man nigga so your body guards can hear you

The Session (Longest Posse Cut in History),Organix,1993.0,"From the Tunnels in the wee hours of the black morning
From The Roots sprout the Foreign Objects family tree
This is mad abstract
All the way live from Philly, we got the hip-hop coalition
Called the Foreign Objects in effect
It's like dat, now dig
 Mr. Trotter, a.k.a

Well um, Black Thought from The Roots y'all
 Mr. Simmons, a.k.a

A.J. Shine, The Dollar Sign, funky bid'ness
 Mr. Pitts, a.k.a

Lord Akil, social misfit
 Mr. Greene, a.k.a

Straight from Sector 6 it's Mr. Manifest
 Ms. Thompson, a.k.a

Shorty... pussy (Oooooh!)
 Mr. Cee, a.k.a

Myself, me Myself and I
 Mr. Dorsey, a.k.a

Pazi Plant, The Soul Plant
 Mr. Armstead, a.k.a

Bo-watt, The Rhythmic Priest
 Mr. Basit, a.k.a

Malik Blizzunt, Foreign Objects
 Mr. Thompson, a.k.a

BROther ?uestion, from Square Roots y'all (yeah, ha-hah)

And we the Foreign Objects (yeah, yeah)
And it's like this..
Now get loose, get loose, Malik B get loose
And just rock heartbeat showin you got juice
And have fun (HAVE FUN) have fun (HAVE FUN)
Have, HAVE, HAVE FUN!!!!

Yes, I will address the press about my microphone mess-iah
Am the best, sire?
Yes, I am most quick to go because I'm equipped to flow a script
I will just slay and disobey, I will display banana clips
That slaughter with the words and the herds of the verbs
I gots the urge to splurge, like a Bosnian Serb
I drift, I means I draft, I means I riff, I means I raff
Rap ca-tas-trophe, don't want no brass tro-phy
So, okey-dokey, folks
Most provoke me, I will choke your throats so hold your oats
Was rollin' 'cause I'm strollin' with the quotes
Like Shakespeare, Mark Twain or Edgar Allan Poe
But since I'm a negro, I flows like Maya Angelou
No banja-lo was played, I means banjo betrayed
So the guitar had to take the bitch off and slay
You might think I'm a rookie or an amateur but put me
On a panel or a channel, I'll dismantle like the vandal-er
I meants to say the scandalous, vandalous, handle this
Like my man Emilio, what y'all should really know
You couldn't get the picture if you was in an portrait or fortress
(So you niggas better forfeit)

Now get loose, get loose, Kid Root get loose
And just rock heartbeat showin' you got juice
And have fun (HAVE FUN) have fun (HAVE FUN)
Have, HAVE, HAVE FUN!!!!

Picture this as I get rugged with the scrpiture
Evacuatin scenes, spreadin thoughts like a drifter
I exit through my state of greater elevation, unifying
Grains through the force of the imagination, you dig
What I'm saying? But I see your mind's playing tricks
You thought you got the channel but you couldn't get a fix
Upon my mental -- I keep it complicated
Explosion of the spirit cause I opened up my soul and created
So now you dig the flavor, you're tasting what I gave ya
Seeping through the cellar cause I be the freak of nature
With, the images that I hold in my head
I be the kid from the Fifth, so y'all holding what I've said
I've said, I be the omnipresent factor from the void
Fatter is the flow, so my styling is employed
I'm ragged, pants worn bagged, and umm
The ghetto be my home so I shouts to the slum
Come, the misfit's got a tale, take you on a mad trip
The thoughts unveil
I'm too deep, you sinks down, I creeps round, the lowest
Of the levels, the positive raps that kill devils
The abstracts, right and exact, knapsack's on the back
Rip poetical flows upon the track
My thoughts escape onto a tape, you'll play it back
And listen, I brought to your mind what's missing

Now get loose, get loose, Pazi Plant get loose
And just rock heartbeat showin you got juice
And have fun (HAVE FUN) have fun (HAVE FUN)
Have, HAVE, HAVE FUN!!!!

I'm hip to release ill units, I displays major soul
The ? out, so soul stays rhythmatic
To the static when it plays, levels from the bass
They chase but they'll never catch my patt-er-ns
Soul surrounds this Plant like the rings upon Sa-tur-n
Yo, I'm fatter than many, came to kick away any job
Umm, cat, conniver if it's abstract I'm liable
Take portion cause I'll fly that head ?
Dig the jazz that's closets from the Paz be-low bugged
Groovy like the nickel bag of love, slidin
Through the groovy fuzz, Plants is the buzz
Mad abornmal, is my flow, much confusion, enhanced in
My scenario's too advanced'n, for duplication
If it's violation, soul power, will shower ya
Defenses now you're falling, and crawling
Cause your styles are infantile not poetically correct
To test I'm laughin at ya, lyrical stature, cause my status
Be that is the coolest kid to do a bid on fakers
With the grammar that be blamma, back in eighty-three
I was the Grand Fruit Jammer, but now I gets down
And wreck shit with the Foreign Objects..
Yeah that's right, the Foreign Objects

Ahhh yeah, now two check, two check
Now check it out, now check it out
Get loose, get loose, Myself ? ? ? get loose
And just rock heartbeat showin you got juice
And have fun (HAVE FUN) have fun (HAVE FUN)
Have, HAVE, HAVE FUN!!!!

Kinda like, ? catch, of the day is mad wreck
I raise heck, no raise hell, you plays back, your tape's ill
Show me just exactly what it is you want, I give you what we got
We got flow, we got soul, we get off, a lot
So lock up, your doors, cause I'm
Busting Loose like Richard Pryor, setting stuff on fire
We got funky, rhymes
Stuff you had swinging, like a monkey, I'm
Always hanging 'round, living off of Vine
As in West Philly, 56th Street
The kids be getting jay'd on the corner
Swing my hat to the back, Kangol, no maybe 5 Soul
Not no bootleg treat, you get from 52nd Street, word up
Word to life, word is bond, word to God
I'm like the bean he's like a bean
I guess the stage is like a pod, ain't with
No metamorphosistically I kiss a licorice
And any miss I wish to kiss or else I diss like this
So I step to the left, drop the mic, catch my breath
Then, watch the Foreign Object catch wreck, uhh

Get loose, get loose, Shorty get loose
And just rock heartbeat showin you got juice
And have fun (HAVE FUN) have fun (HAVE FUN)
Have, HAVE, HAVE FUN!!!!

Can I kicks it?
I kicks it for the others so I kick it for you
I gotta nag a dog and note to Billy - I gets down
Sound's got a lot I got my own I'm throwin passes
Asses are grabbed, when I swing with The Roots
Suits, I got none, but throwin off that accoutrements
Ever since I winced at the thought of a dress
Yes you might be wantin to consider me a tomboy
Boy get it right, I'm still strictly lovin men
Send me your love, don't ever think I don't need it
Shit I got problems, can you help me out?
Shout a little louder if you're sure that you hear me
Fear me not, I'm just another average girl
Curls in my head, and yeah I think I look good
Should I be the one, to break the bad news?
Snooze when I'm tired, not when I'm hype, your type
Yo I just came off!

Get loose, get loose, Manifest get loose
And just rock heartbeat showin you got juice
And have fun (HAVE FUN) have fun (HAVE FUN)
Have, HAVE, HAVE FUN!!!!

Introducing lyrics for the year of ninety-three
The black brainchild is about to kick the groovy
Speak out the head, provided for the hardrocks
Here to resurrect the ghetto beats for the blocks
You can dig the styles cause the styles are for the digging
A fat sack of soul, that's how the Sector roll
Never making fake material, why should I?
The mind is so equipped to rip, so why would I
Give you less than that, you in fact, this is where it's at
Cause lyrics I've provided is about to swing the bat
And shake up the levels from New York to Montego
It's all about the lyrics, it's not about the ego
Quick to make a jam and slam sound like the pro that I am
It's profound, like the kids from the underground
Every single lyric is prepared, in the hunt for the metro
With scoops of fat loops and funky lingo
Level's being felt, all over in the fifty states
Breaking more beats than my moms breaks the china plates
Transmitting, hitting areas we freak with funk
When we come to planet Earth, with a trunk of fat, soul
Alert doing work on the everyday
Here to bring the swing like my man Donny Hathaway
Just, follow the dotted line, and do what we do
Because you gotta get a grip, if you want your shit

Now get loose, get loose, Lord Akil get loose
And just rock heartbeat showin you got juice
And have fun (HAVE FUN) have fun (HAVE FUN)
Have, HAVE, HAVE FUN!!!!

Umm, from the Southern side of Philly yet of The Roots
There comes me, who?
The janky little brother of Mr. Bruce
A jazz kickin kid who flows, like the river Jordan
Not fond of Honda scooters, but I'll take an Accord and
Zoom right through your borough, because I'm crazy thorough
No offspring running 'round but no my penile is not sterile
Collects the crazy papes from, selling crazy tapes, umm
Big heads be gettin swollen, I crush em just like grapes
The level that I'm zoning, the one that's on the third
Eatin buds or mad grass that gets you HIGHER than a bird
Kinks, be in the head, cause I leave the curls to Jheri
Got mad souls out the ass with shit, fat like William Perry
A poor black kid with rhythm, a eye for jazzy beats
Straight from the underground, found new life on the South Streets
We ? off the jams that will uplift the people's souls
Cause the Objects that are Foreign, the kids with baggy clothes
Are the cats that I'm coolin with, when we be together
Two and two equals four but Foreign Objects be forever
So, just let me flow as I reach up to the next plateau
And then you'll give me my respect
Uhh, cause I'm a Foreign Object

Now get loose, get loose, A.J. Shine get loose
And just rock heart-beat showin you got the juice
And have fun (HAVE FUN) have fun (HAVE FUN)
Have, HAVE, HAVE FUN!!!!

First off, I'm burstin off shots of gab
And gettin lifted by the gift, I start to jab
The rhymes that I grab send schools to the slab
As I write scores, the funky orator's gone
On some next ish lookin
For the next fish with a wish that used to be a duck
But now you're stuck dumbstruck
Trying to hang but you can't swim I think you're fucked
You traded in your blues for boom, tap shoes
I do shows and change all opposing views
I get down, I go up as I blow up
Cause I got this O.M.B. rhyme you can't defuse
Yeahhh, here to rock all of you rockers
When I carry the ball, I stay be-hind my blockers
I move swift, I needs no lift
I don't have to riff because I shift the gift
And now my name is Joseph Simmons, but I'm not Run
With the mic in my hand, I've only just begun
To hold mine, I'mma goldmine plus a ton
The way I shine, I be the rising sun, huh!
How many times must I have to say
This I never miss yo when I display?
From styles I paint the funky picture I portray and
Before I hit the court I made it my forte
Cause I got this, you can come and get this, cause my
Method is the most and I boast so you can bet this
Is like the best of the rest of the flock
And now you're walkin down the hallways of the Always Jock
Abbreviated A.J. here for the day
Bustin rhymes in your face while I'm fadin away
It's like that y'all, and ya don't stop
The funky Bid on the root with the hip-hop

Now.. get loose, get loose, ?uestion get loose
And, rock heart-beat showin YOU got juice
And have fun (HAVE FUN) have fun (HAVE FUN)
Have, HAVE, HAVE FUN!!!!

It's me the BROther ?uestion on the M-I-C to flow
To bust a fat rat-a-tat rhyme one mo' gen'
I'm flexin with my mental verbalistic chocolate
Sucker know you're listenin so please get off of it
A score and two years ago began the ?uestion's mission
South of 52nd Street, on stage?
And anybody wanna diss the sure shot body rock
Fresh flowin dude, we can take it to the stage
Sucker, Foreign Objects coming soon
From the rat cave to a room with a view
My brother's B.G., and my band is Josh U
And the stank whole rhythmic funk, plus my nuc'
You can comprehend the verbal letters that I send
Ahh, ooooh, ahhhh, like Boyz II Men
I don't have a Benz-y shoes are walkin like Jimmy
Make em say, ""Yo ?uestion's demi,"" make em squeal like ?
Man, yo, I jams on every gram
Move out the way, I gets on, rockin round the clock
In school I used to doodle, nowadays I use my noodle
And I'll be rockin planets, and soon I'm livin fatter
I'm a levelheaded son who knows where I came from
Umm, lights, camera... ?uestion

Get loose, get loose, Black Thought get loose
And just rock heartbeat showin you got the juice
And have fun (HAVE FUN) have fun (HAVE FUN)
Have, HAVE, HAVE FUN!!!!

Well umm, yik-yik yak-yak, chi-chi-chi-ka-SPLACK
Thoughts that I stutter and brother that I left back behind
Lines of swine I'm qualified for groovy stew achoo
I caught the boogie like the flu and God Bless the Black
Cardiac cerebral abstract cathedral
The mental is the temple and the central sees you tryin to flam!
Man I catch a lift like Bob Mar-ley, and par-lay
On airy clouds I drop, bombs like a Sau-di, Arabian
Flocks I rocks like Fabian
It's the nipple sex upon the grits that call me baby and
Run a finger, through the knaps of the rap, singer that
Pull a scat, from the stack, that I keep in the shack
Of my soul, bring the bowl I got the flat out good
That's why I'm dug by the hippies plus the pimps and hoods
In the slum, could I umm, come, should I umm, come
Yes I does, and gets down said I wasn't know that I was
But they gel, that's why they blow up cause they didn't give spect
To the erector of the Foreign Object, I collect, to preserve
Plus develop and envelop in The Roots of rhyme
Yo that's the end of the line, I got mine, and I'm out

A-ha! Ahh, suki suki now
It's the Brother ?uestion
And now you know how it is
When the Foreign Objects get wreck
Like that, yeah, ha ha ha

Glitches (The Skin You’re In),Down to Earth Soundtrack ,UnKnown,"You live, you die
And spend the years in between asking the question
Why you've been through what you been
You lose, you win, you even pay for other sins
But you must always adore the skin you are in

I woke up and it was pouring down rain
I put my head on, it really wasn't no thang
One of them days I was feeling immune to the pain
Threw on, Alice Coltrane, smoked and sang
And wrote this flame, composed to the rhythm of the droplets
And went whispering similar to gossip
The kick slapping at the window glass
Slow down the globe so it don't spin too fast
Because, I've been running like a river since
The age of my early innocence
It just made me ambitious
My grams used to tell me ""Man, listen
If you can't burn, don't step into the kitchen""
You muscle your turn, the laws of the land vicious
We gotta stick to the plan, which is
Pursuing true riches, whether we trade stock or wash dishes
Throughout setbacks and few glitches
The Big Picture's the focus, fuck being hopeless
Or helpless, we not selfish so we wrote this
Give it to ya, make you feel good
Know what I'm talking about? C'mon

You live, you die
And spend the years in between asking the question
Why you've been through what you've been
You lose, you win, you even pay for other sins
But you must always adore the skin you are in

Yo, from the parquet floors to the fifty foot ceiling
I pull the heavy black curtain back, now revealing
The sun beneath the velvet
And like it was mine, no one else's
Embracing the beams, yo, I felt it
And stood there, feeling it and getting charged
Turn me loose upon the streets, a young poet at large
Out in the world, up against tremendous odds
Some'll let it break 'em and they throw in they cards
But my squad remain focus when we going for ours
And we don't, do it for chains or do it for cars
And we don't, do it for lames or do it for broads
And we don't, do it for fame, we do it because
It's for the young, black, gifted mind
Living the story of the most twisted kind
Turbulent times swirled around they dome like a turban
It gets disturbing, feeling alone in the urban
But maintain ya grip for just a little bit
I'd tell you it's all good but that's bullshit
Let's just try to feel good, yeah
Know what I'm talkin bout? C'mon

A spirit knows we're meant to flow
A ? rose by the seat of your soul
You past it all and seeds you sow
Are destined to grow even after you go

You live, you die
And spend the years in between asking the question
Why you've been through what you been
You lose, you win, you even pay for other sins
But you must always adore the skin you are in
You live, you die
And spend the years in between asking the question
Why you've been through what you been
You lose, you win, you even pay for other sins
But you must always adore the skin you are in
You live, you die
And spend the years in between asking the question
Why you've been through what you been
You lose, you win, you even pay for other sins
But you must always adore the skin you are in
You live, you die
And spend the years in between asking the question
Why you've been through what you been
You lose, you win, you even pay for other sins
But you must always adore the skin you are in",https://genius.com/The-roots-glitches-the-skin-youre-in-lyrics

On who's the fuckin dopelist or wind up hopeless
Lookin for some soup, tryin to recoup
Some fuckin loot, only thing you get is the boot
To me these punk MC's is nothin but fruit
Cakes, shake they booty on stage and get head

You might get lit like a front of a spliff
For runnin, off at the lips talkin that nonsense

In Love With The Mic,The Tipping Point,2004.0,"Yo momma
She pull up on in the street
Nasty she said I smell defeat huh

Alright y'all, 100 grand says I get it in one take
Thats right baby, one take Dave
One take Dizzle
Here we go

She want to know if we can be together
Even if it ain't gonna be forever
But it can only be for one night
The only thing I ever loved in my life was the mic
She want to know if we can be together
Even if it ain't gonna be forever
But it can only be for one night
The only thing I ever loved in my life was the mic

Trust me, It's something 'bout the way I touch her
The way that I hold her, the way I clutch her
She move a lot but that ain't shit to me
Man, I need that bitch and that bitch need me
I ain't even talking bout R-A-P
Them other lames be the same
Them don't worry me
Sit back
I spit that shit that
Get better then
Make a veteran sit back
Cruisin', mic check one twosin'
If y'all not us, then that's why y'all losin'
Eight up
No time to wake up
No masquerade nigga move the maker
Just do it
Put the hop in to it
And when you lose it
Don't blame the music
Half y'all fell in love with a whore
The question is if you don't love her
What you fucking her for, nigga

Huh?
We get started ain't gon' be no stopping
You gonna jump because it ain't gon' be no option
I'm totally contagious
Black man engaged in language
Black Thought AKA Larry Davis huh?
Got rhymes running off the pages
Tighter than the Bushes with the Saudi Arabians
Darker than an oil well
Sharp as a saber tooth tiger
Lying on a straight edge razor
New York talking on a two-way pager
Till ya main thing getting me the captain saver
I won't backslide cause I'd be a failure to mics
Rip tight like it's my genitalia
Huh?
The hip biatch she
Ain't your D appallin'
And a banana cognac biatch
Coney hair coat, my boots is ostreeotch
Black Inc. back, turn me up another nee-otch

She want to know if we can be together
Even if it ain't gonna be forever
But it can only be for one night
The only thing I ever loved in my life was the mic
For what?

And what a nigga if he wasn't in the game

Something to sprang

I ain't go no problem causing drama to y'all
You never score
Like a punter
Running with the ball
Squeeze mics
Chuck north the man

Unwritten,Rising Down,2008.0,"When I think about the good times, I think about yesterday
You can ask me about the future, I don't know what to say

Yo, it was a cold night, not cold like the winter
Just cold like a energy was in the air, I generally don't like
The driver had to dip, so he left me in the whip
Turned around and said ""You know you're on your own, right?""
...
I'm the zone like
There's pictures on the wall of my own life
Just like a drive-in
Only it's live, and this a montage of the places I been
My sixth sense taste the problem
The suspense had my heart racin', throbbin'
Just like a young punk with a tape revolver
Pointed at the driver of a car, faced to rob him
The cigarettes chased the vodka
The nigga just chased the dream but won't taste the monster
The son won't face the father, the gun won't erase the drama

What Goes On Pt. 7,Do You Want More?!!!??!,1995.0,"Do you wanna know... what goes on?
Do you wanna know... what goes on?
(Tell me, baby!)

Yo, niggas cannot see me, cannot be me or
Capture the metaphoric phrase blasted off stage when I tour
I am but a messenger born to blow up
My niggas knew it all the time
Lyrically, I was a dime at the age of nine, shorty Black could rhyme
On the mic, I never wasted time, I'm the exquisite wizard
When I visit shorties, I hit it, I'm cool as a blizzard, nigga, whut?!
If you want, I'll bust your fronts with the butt of my black
Paper chase ya and then erase ya rhyme
Sucker MC's, how I hate the way you waste your time
My state of mind shine like it's diamond studded
I rhyme blunted on stage
Word is bond, when I'm on, I rage
Got the 12 gauge at the rest, so play and into rest you lay
My everyday M.O. is gettin' dough 'cause times is rougher
Than a mother for brothers to scuffle, shuffle your cards, kid
'Cause the odds is, niggas'll hustle and live foul
This wild environment hostile produce the music in me
So, my style's the blend of what is and was
You could get a buzz from it
But enter too deep and reach a summit, you fall and then plummet
Beyond real, where you're killed if your raps ain't ill
Another crab motherfucker, 'nother cap to peel
Through these amps, I motivate camps to dance
Niggas too advanced, I warn, I'm just tellin' you what goes on


Inside my head, you wish to see
The signs appear, the shit's not clear
What if I flipped, would you know how to maintain your edge?
I'm takin' heads because, there's no fuckin' ledge
I pledge allegiance to my cosmic guide
I couldn't fit in three dimensions if I tried
Civilizations I can delete, so crews don't bother me
Battle with Jehovah, gainin' universal sovereignty
Niggas run around like clones, I got planets and thrones
Throughout the galaxy, my name's well known
I'm all alone in my zone, you wouldn't understand
Stare in my face, fuck around and catch a sun tan

Here on this agenda, there is no pretenders
So, when we begin to assassinate your cast members
They shall hinder, wavin' white flags, ""Man, we surrender""
Those half-assed negroes know they're no contenders
In syringes, I can shoot up lyrical vengeance
And my grammar might do a mandatory life in slammers
You should regret it, thinkin' about steppin' to me
Niggas forget it - you'll get gassed with lyrics leaded
Most energetic, I never snag, I'm tightly threaded
I flip scripts like pattern twistness in calisthenics
Black Thought, ELO and me - a trio
Talent is strong, word is bond
I'm just tellin' you what goes on",https://genius.com/The-roots-what-goes-on-pt-7-lyrics
Take It There,Game Theory,2006.0,"Stand up, stretch for the stars
Get somebody else involved right next to ya
Y'all elected me to keep it so fresh for ya
Just cause I make it possible for the rest of ya
To just take it there come on and
Get your head ringin' from the sting of the snare
Spine tingle elevating every singular hair
All the way from South Philly on a wing and prayer
And still bringin' it yeah

C'mon take it there
C'mon take it there
Let's take it there
C'mon take it there

I'm from the side of town
Where shots get sprayed around
So the expectancy rate be twenty-eight around
Downtown battleground where cops parade around
Have your whole view of life beyond jaded
How everybody sick of breaking down, tryin' a make it out
Hand over fist the only way to get the paper down
People tired of gettin' pushed around, gettin' gangsta now
Discipline the only way to bring some kinda change around
Chain cirgarette smokin' with bad nerves
And brothas with bad lungs from smokin' mad herb
Whoever in the dark is unseen and heard
Let's emerge, I can feel something close we on the verge
Talkin' bout, to my street sweepers, hotel housekeepers
And my people spillin' this out through jail house speakers
Some people rather use they mics than use heaters
Some people rather lose they life than lose freedom
For real

C'mon take it there
C'mon take it there
Let's take it there
C'mon take it there

Society's time bomb laying dormant
Our people disenfranchised from the free world
Oil for food but they still hungry
No democracy
They said one vote equals one voice
But he told you if he can't work to make it
He'll rob to take it
The villains
Abandoning the planet and the people
Another hot summer yo, they 'bout to flood the prisons
This ain't no do diddley, it's a do somethin'

Flash light, red light, proceed ahead right
Straight into them headlights, you get your head right
Head right get a third strike, hit the turnpike
Life quicker than spliff that wouldn't burn right
Make you wanna holla 'bout it
It ain't no doubt about it
Every now and then you gotta stand up and shout about it
And I'll be shoutin' it to, as if a shout'll count
Yo they got accountin' to do, reamount the balance
The shit more puzzlin' than a jigsaw
Raw pitbulls hustlin' through the pitfalls
Some of y'all toys let the laughter rip roar
Heart felt truth in every lyric I spit forth
Raise up time to lift off
Written on a legal pad, poetry that sizzle the clip board
My og, my homey who taught me deal
Said in prayer that's the only time you should ever kneel
And that's real, I'm a take it there

C'mon take it there
C'mon take it there
Let's take it there

It's the sex patrol, the sex patrol
Aiyo, sis was that wicked, wanted me to kick it
Said I never dance, made advance outside
Took a glance to inspect, shorty was correct
So it seemed, her name Siobhan, age seventeen
I flipped when I seen her eyes, bloodshot green
She said she wanted riches and a nigga with cash
Lex, Land or a Path, didn't know the half
I react to flip the script and get ill

Tossed up was the digits 'cause the game is like Splendor
I said, ""Sabrina, yeah, I met you way back in December
You remember?"" She said, ""I guess""
Substitute to Santa, she was sittin' on the desk
And then she said, ""You never called me
Malik, you never tried to press
You never tried to push the seven buttons and address""
I said, ""Hold up, sis, you're out of order, man, you lost it
My name ain't Jake, Malik's no Flake that's Frosted.""
Tryin' to cause a scene, Sabrina's best is self-redeemed
She thought she was cute, but never made it on my team

Better hurry up before she gets lost in the crowd of
""Excuse me, miss, excuse me, miss""
""No, I'm not havin' it!"" I just got dissed
I didn't get mad, was calm and collect
I didn't call her bitch, I didn't break her neck
Start to wonder why the brothers disrespect the cutie
It's a place of 180's and the high-priced floozie

Baby, I can see everythin' you wanna be

Known to be shown around, sported by the niggas

Kickin' it to me as if I don't know the time
But I'm the Black Thought, I'm all up in your mind
I figure you the kind to say, ""Give me a call""
But then switch to act strange, countin' all my change

Behind the laughter they thinkin about jammin me
But they don't know, I got somethin for them
But I ain't with that negative vibe, so fuck all that

Your fundamentally floored, philosophically bored
Disturbed like the eighth floor of your hospital ward

Muslims praise Allah, Christians pray to God
Rastas, they say Jah
They find a way to rhyme with the pallet like fine wine
And make you say ahhh

Swept Away,Do You Want More?!!!??!,1995.0,"MC's who slept for days, must be swept away
MC's who slept for days, must be swept away
MC's who slept for days, must be swept away
MC's who slept for days, must be swept away

The rhythm just sways, and like a sorceress I slays
Foes and rivals who wanna come this way
They better pay attention or a penchant
Not to mention suspension
From the microphone, plus detention
Trey-eight-o's
 will vacate those
If there's drama with my henchmen
So, lamp to my man Mussolini
Go get your whole staff, those decaf
'Cause half-and-half's couldn't cream me
The lyrics make your head knock
Malik B and Black Thought, the dreadlock
Mannn, trannns-gression, you'll catch lead
I crushin', poundin' on the drums like King Kong
We can ring your bellll, ding-dong
I styles with my vocabulary
The Roots, the one you call your ultra adversary
Now, you're all desert 'cause I'mma serve ya like a tray
To meet your doom, Malik's the broom, so you get swept awayyyy

MC's who slept for days, must be swept away

MC's who slept for days, must be swept away
MC's who slept for days, must be swept away

Yo, hello everybody, do I need introduct?
I be the mic mercenary, very un-clear to your ear
The exquisite pattern that you hear
Is known to be Black Butter, baby
Crazy cardiac, my attack on any fat rhythm
That I capture, kid, I snatch the mic from tykes
While I proceed and continue to tend to
Business, kid, this is how I do
I'm insane and 
go against the grain like 
Never on no nigga dick 'cause I'm just too hip
Plus, I rest where niggas pack and never act other than ill
Shit is real in Phy-double
So, if you want trouble, let's stomp
My mission is to flip on comp
You might aspire to be flyer than I, you must pay
Your dues, while I bruise niggas new for the day
Shall be swept away

MC's who slept for days, must be swept away
MC's who slept for days, must be swept away
MC's who slept for days, must be swept away
MC's who slept for days, must be swept away

There's somethings goin' on
Because there's somethin' goin' on, on
Yeah, something's goin on

Lost Desire,Rising Down,2008.0,"It's the love, in your heart
Or the pain, in your mind
No one cares, what the truth is
Cause them fortunes, they don't lie
It's the love, in your heart
Or the pain, in your mind
No one cares, what the truth is
Cause them fortunes, they don't lie

Okay, uh-huh, okay, yo
I'm exhausted, but I never ever forfeit
Y'all just bullshit while I knock a nigga off quick
Y'all start speaking in tongues and start reaching for guns
A militant will put this heat in your lungs
The street and the slums, the weekend is done
The local class always show you what the heat is become
The seasons are done, and reasons are none
People dyin', bullets flyin' cause they squeezin' for fun
It's all of a nightmare that's right there
They hopin' that somebody in the hood just might care
With all this protestin' and rallyin', death toll tallyin'
Foul smells around them, pails in the alley and
Corner filled with teddy bears cause they killed a child again
They sing about murder, so it ain't a song it's hollerin'
Get off the choir with your soft attire
Niggas out here don't give a fuck cause they lost desire

It's the love, in your heart
Or the pain, in your mind
No one cares, what the truth is
Cause them fortunes, they don't lie
It's the love, in your heart
Or the pain, in your mind
No one cares, what the truth is
Cause them fortunes, they don't lie

Yeah, my city's full of, heartbreakers and stargazers
Who puff garsh Vegas so they gone with the wind like Clark Gable
Breathin' like Darth Vader, believin' in dark angel
Yeah we got flags but they not star-spangled
We not patriotic, the heroes are not them
Ghetto grills like rims, you stop, they still spin
Tall tales at the bar, witnessed after dark
And we still stomp in in chicken and brown Timbs
And listen to Rakim with the way that y'all been
For realla, I hadn't been schemin' or plottin'
You fear us? But fear itself personified
Payin' homage to homicide, prayin' to the dollar sign
It's idle worship
, the rebel forces
Bodies lie at the foundation of the fortress
This is war, we expect some losses
And we comin' for the heads of the bosses

It's the love, in your heart
Or the pain, in your mind
No one cares, what the truth is
Cause them fortunes, they don't lie
It's the love, in your heart
Or the pain, in your mind
No one cares, what the truth is
Cause them fortunes, they don't lie

Yo, we on some casualties of war shit
, what you stand for, kid?
We in the city where they definitely lost it
You open your eyelids and get capped in the ribs
Your funeral they have your 12th grade portrait
Pretty corpse in casket, bell-shaped orchids
Said he 19 and left a self-made fortune
And left tres orphans, now he in a box
With the same chain and watch that never came off him
It's a shame what it cost him, where he come from it ain't nothin'
It's a everyday thing, that's a problem
It's chambers revolvin', bustin' like Russian roulette
With a full set, they change what the odds is
Flames in the mosque and, people held hostage
Everyday I struggle, try to get up out the mosh-pit
Homicide for profit, tell me how we not sick?
This shit is out of control, they can't stop it

It's the love, in your heart
Or the pain, in your mind
No one cares, what the truth is
Cause them fortunes, they don't lie
It's the love",https://genius.com/The-roots-lost-desire-lyrics
Grits,Organix,1993.0,"Yo Malik Blunt
 Whassup?
Tell me how you like your grits man
 Man I like ALL KINDS of grits son
I just don't like them sticky grits
Word, that was trippy
Whassup with you Black Thought man, wassup?
 Word, organix, groovy stew grits
With cheese, and mad honey
That ain't nuttin man!
 That's the grits that needs cash man!
I like my grits with sugar man
 I like them with BUTTER
Sweet and smooth man

Who gets the grits? (Say what?) Bust it, let a
Brother tell another about the real grits getters
(Yeah, the grits getters get the grits y'all)

Now, me? I'm out to get the grits more than a little bit
If I said, ""Don't get it, black,"" you know I'd be a hypocrite
Levels often fluctuate to surplus from deficit
Rated with the X is the X-tra X-plicit grits
I, slides, AND slips, AND dives, AND dips
Into it, it being grits that I gets like a quaker
But take the raincoats for the oats
When you crush trail mix yo, I dig my grits fixed slow
With butter, you slip up in the grits and make 'em other
Some people call it skins but grits is the other term
That you gots to learn to keep up on all the scoop
I get a little ends but never spends loot
For the wiggle, some immature kids like to laugh
So, they giggle for the grits and when they get close
They start skitz-in, not this kid because I switched in
Flipped in, changed the position that I hits in-side
I glide, words can't describe how I move, be
Like hittin' a doobie, Thought'll get ya groovy, so!
Yo, black, here's a bit of advice:
Your wife's nice so you better keep the girls away
From the grits getter


Yeah, I likes to unzip it, strip it then grip it
To be specific, I won't lick it so get the ticket
Flip it like it was a coin, put the loins in the groins
In other words the groins I stretch, now you gets the sketch
You, know I use my mark like the one on Noah's Ark
But if I happen to see a spark, I umm, parks my bark
Guess I haves to rest my lumber for the next number to sum
But so I can't slumber or sleep, my shovel's diggin' deep
Peep this hick whose name was Vickie, gettin' tricky, rather slicky
Her performance showed endurance
She said, ""Me like to licky licky""
Body more gracious or should I say bodacious
Took my order then she sorta served me like she was a waitress
Never will I say that she was tasteless
Maker of the pastry, so's I calls her pastress
Still enthused 'cause I got my cruise on
P-O-L-O blues on, when I choose to move, I puts my shoes on
Protection, against infection
Erect projections travels south in your mouth
Like a dentist checked in, commence to be intent
She said, ""I can't understand you, but damn you like Prince""
I make it feel like a Zulu, from Honolulu
By the way she roll away like a dog who name was Ubu
They also said the way I enter from the center is adventurous
Imprint on you dentures when I bust
Or I thrust, Mid-Atlantic, they act like a schizophrenic
Sometimes they panic like I'm Diggin on a Planet
I don't gotta Beama or a Jetta, ?C-ka-Reama alla netta?
Malik is the slick grits getter


I would be lyin' if I told you I could not
Prepare a fat bowl of sticky, grits for a quickie
Humans get picky and judge it by the thickness
But if it bends your spoon
Then add some butter with the quickness
I might get a bit smoother if you move her to a better position
That's probably what she wishin'
You can add some groovy spices to give it extra
But my advice is to first let it simmer
Hot, if it's hot then let the pot sit and cool
'Cause if you spill your milk, we label you beginner
Humans gotta know that I keep my bowl full of grits
Swingin' with their daughters while their parents throwin' fits
Tellin' me to change my diet plan, to Bran cereal
Or rice, I tried that twice, it didn't work
In fact, it made my milk kinda sour
Half and half, part creamer, and skeemer
That's why if it's grits then it gotta be organic
'Cause if it's artificial, I panic

Yo man, what about me man?
* everybody clowns *
Yo man, just pass your grits down man
(You needs to eat Gerber man)

Who gets the grits? Now, let me tell ya
A plenty posse bloom from the cellar, to nail ya
Daughter or your sister, the younger skins elixir
Kick a cat but I won't lick a cat, I'll figure
I'd rather play the thigh kisser, sister
I don't die swift and yo, I'm not a quitter
So, umm, let me place my hands upon that waist and trace
My way to the right nip and left nip then sip
Similac, until my Jimmy grows fat, grab my pack of hats
From the back, then flee to the next block
To knock off socks, yo, you know my props
So, father, don't bother
'Cause once the grits is hot, yo they're good as got

Livin’ in a New World,Game Theory,2006.0,"Turn up the boombox, put on your hightops
Come on outside, today's gon' be the day
We start livin in the new world

Yo, they got high-powered lenses on the cameras outside
It ain't nowhere to run it ain't hardly nowhere to hide
They hear you when you whisperin so try to keep quiet
You don't even realize that youse a twinkle in the all-seein' eye
From the time you in the bar gettin high
To havin conversations on your phone through the wire
You can't drive but it's definitely footage of your ride
Livin in this day and time, it's a funny kind of vibe
From the corners of the ceiling feel its eyes in back of me
I couldn't tell you why I think they constantly after me
Maybe it's cause the news put it to me so graphically
How niggas don't obey no laws, not even gravity boy
No benefit of doubt he had to be wrong
He from the corner where they known to get they casualty on
Another day another scene to perform, spotlight him on Friday
Come and lock him up Saturday morn, c'mon

Turn up the boombox, put on your hightops
Come on outside, today's gon' be the day

The Anti-Circle,Organix,1993.0,"Yo, I'm the Anti-Circle
On the mad train like a rain that's Purple, I storm
Never comin' twice in one form
The Black'll act a fool and I'm gone
Crumbs, bust it, pass the popcorn (Yeah)
As I kick flavor, behavior abstract, I get recog-nition
But I represent no religion or sect
So I'm no preacher, but I reach your soul 'cause I'm stronger
The younger son of Cassandra
Like ganja I grow from the root, like water I flow
Could sport either the low or the nappy Afro
I still will have the pick 'cause I choose to evict
Derelicts on the tip, tryin' to diss the mad skit, bust a skit
How many licks do it take to make a fake
Realize that he can't shake, bake or penetrate
This style I demonstrate on a regular
Basis and face that he ain't no competitor?
I said it a second ago, yo, I'm the Anti-Circle with the mad style
Crushin' any mental that be fragile
You don't wanna see me get like agile
Rippin' up the scene, screamin' like I was a bad child
Black Thought, so hip that I'm square
The rhythm that you hear is from the kids right over there
The Rubber Band and ?uestion just one step away
Yesterday was a day away, attention you should pay today
To The Roots, stickin', boot kickin' with flippa
I lift the party up and y'all get down like a zipper
The mista hippa flippa kid
The one who digs the music and be hurtin' a
Rhythm when I get Anti-Circular

From the square to the circle to the square
From the square to the circle to the square
From the square to the circle to the square
From the square to the circle to the square, y'all

What you spot up with ya beepers is the creeper
Stompin' on the ground, smokin' a quarter pound reefer
Mr. Five Finger lead singer, noise maker
Number one, run, umm, rush, now you must hush!
I crush trail mix with the sandal
Five Fingers keep a candlestick lit when I vandalize
Can't see what I is or will be
Only what I was 'cause I crush an MC (Like Rakim, G)
I'm dandy, happy-go-lucky, don't touch me, don't play me
'Cause I'm not the right one, baby, yeah!
Crazy off-key, never talk softly
Blacker than a bean, still I never sweat coffee
The fourth be followin' the third, word, second after first
Yo, never rehearse a verse that I'm freestylin'
'Cause my verse is diverse, I'm Mr. Versatilin'
Things are easier with oooh, child and ya smilin'
Because you dig the way that I deliver
And give a style, flowin' like I was the Nile River, you shiver
'Cause I'm cooler than the coolest, act a fool, it's like a habit
So yo, this trick is for the rabbit
I grab it and snatch it, inspect it like Gadget
I works the magic, the mic, I must have it
How many kids does the pin on the vibe Tribe
Members do decide to stand around at the sit down?
(Get down!) Ain't ya know I'm quick to rip a kid down?
Aim to put wack rappers in containers with the lid down
So I seal it, can you feel it? Many contacts is caught

Sing another song, singing man
Sing another song, singing man
Sing a song for me
Sing a song for me

Look, I'm so twisted, so, so twisted
One life to live and I'm willing to risk it
Terror that the world has never known existed
Left so many clues, now how could they miss it?
Sadistic, ballistic, find a word and pick it
Long as it means the world is on my shit list
Walking time bomb, my mind is on tick-tick
Countdown's on, it's too late to nix it
I'm so anxious, so, so anxious
The ones I hate barely know what my name is
Have no clue that I'm armed and dangerous
Willing to spill my blood to be famous
Willing to spill my blood to make changes
Look for a suicide note to explain this
Heinous, inking the ache from my anguish
Sounds insane, you're speaking my language

Days are living fast, moves in misery
You got a song you wanna sing for me?
Sing a song, singing man
Sing a song, singing man
Sing another song, singing man
Sing another song, singing man
Sing a song for me
Sing a song for me

One for the crescent, two for the cross
Three for the blessing, four for the loss
Kid holding a weapon, walk like a corpse
In the face of transgression, military issue Kalash-
-Nikova or machete or a pitchfork
He killing cause he feel he got nothing to live for
In a war taking heads from men like Charles Taylor
And never seen the undisclosed foreign arms dealer
13-year-old killer, he look 35
He changed his name to Little No-Man-Survive
When he smoke that leaf, shorty believe he can fly
He loot and terrorize and shoot between the eyes
Who to blame? It's a shame, the youth was demonized
Wishing he could see rearrange the truth, to see the lies
And he wouldn't have to raise his barrel to target you
His heart can't give you the years of scar tissue

Days are living fast, moves in misery
You got a song you wanna sing for me?
Sing a song, singing man
Sing a song, singing man
Sing another song, singing man
Sing another song, singing man
Sing a song for me
Sing a song for me

Uh, what you're witnessing is true dedication
Charged by the call and the cause of the nation
Countdown, minutes away from detonation
A lifetime of grunt work, this is the culmination
My manner, seems patient, inner rage lies
So deep, I can taste it, let's sacrifice lives
Past the first sensation, to paradise I fly
Delusions are lighting up the midday sky
The last days of mine spent in extreme secrecy
Wolves dressed like sheep occur more frequently
Too much faith to be scared, the petrified been fled
Those who live fearing death, might as well be dead
Towers of the occupiers, will soon fall
Martyr or mass murderer? That's your call
Mass transit or a mall? Who can watch 'em all?
In the name of the merciful, sing me a song

Days are living fast, moves in misery
You got a song you wanna sing for me?
Sing a song, singing man
Sing a song, singing man
Sing another song, singing man
Sing another song, singing man
Sing a song for me

And peep this Ethiopian queen from Philly takin' classes abroad

Says she's workin' on a flick and could my click do the score
She says she loved my show at Paris at Elys'e Montmartre
That I stepped off the stage and took a piece of her heart
We knew from the start that things fall apart and tend to shatter
She like, that shit don't matter, when I get home get at her
Through letter, phone, whatever

Shit, you think not? You think that Thought went home and forgot?
Time passed, now we're back in Philly and she up in my spot

Behind a phrase they was crazy enough to coin
You kiddin me? The pursuit of happiness, life, liberty
And all type a necessities they not givin me
I put my body in jeopardy, cause I'm committed
Even though they try to stifle ya man creativity
They got hopes and plans a gettin rid of me
I hit em like Ethiopia hit up Italy
Swift as the bullet that killed King and Kennedy
You know the battle is on for infinity, now

The show, the show, it must go on
The show, the show, it must go on
I can't stop, I won't stop
I will not, I will ride
The show, the show, it must go on
The show, the show, it must go on
I can't stop, I won't stop
I will not, I will ride
The show

I remember the show like Dougie when people quiet was ugly
Yellin', ""Get money"", now the show done went dummy
Still doin shows where the spots be bummy
Roaches in the dressing room, I'm thinkin of a better room
Maybe the upper where my people won't suffer
The leather gets tougher, we drive like a trucker
Through the night, for every wrong making two rights
And use mics to reach new heights, the blue lights
Follow, I guess it's the scent of Chicago
That make 'em wanna mess 'em up tomorrow
In these borrowed days, the rhyme and the mind that pays
The world is a show, you define ya stage
One two, it's live so you can't undo
No sleep cause then ya dreams won't come true
And everyone's like a broad that we run through
Each venue, this ain't gon' stop so we just gon' continue

The show, the show, it must go on
The show, the show, it must go on
I can't stop, I won't stop
I will not, I will ride
The show, the show, it must go on
The show, the show, it must go on
I can't stop, I won't stop
I will not, I will ride
The show

The Ernest Hemmingway of B-boy poems
They can never take the pen away of LeRoi Jones
Pushin' a black Yukon gold in a new time zone
Diggin' on every nuance with two eyes closed
The life I chose, more of a mission
I make a crowd convulse and act on impulse and intuition
I've seen the future, listen, believe the superstition
I keep spittin' 'til it's a truce or crucifixion
I’m at home in the pressure zone, weakness is never shown
Let alone, I'm a man made of mere flesh and bone
I can't help that my heart beat is a metronome
And I've acquired a taste that's upper echelon
Lyrical professional, maniac megalo
Plate in my head that spin the way the record go
And break it down like it's the walls of Jericho
If they don't know by know, they prob'ly never know

The show, the show, it must go on
The show, the show, it must go on
I can't stop, I won't stop
I will not, I will ride
The show, the show, it must go on
The show, the show, it must go on
I can't stop, I won't stop
I will not, I will ride

I rip the vocal backflip yo the kid is a bad bro

Guess my address or my P.O., here's a hint:
I'm from Phila with a Del but not the Rio
Well, I'm guessing here is like exactly where the Phi go
Now, we got the Phila-Del-Phi why not top it off with an A?
The Philadelphiadic rhythmatic way I'm straight from Philly
Silly but rugged then a hill-billy
Just like I said before I sport my skully when it's chilly
My cap is from The Lay Up, my bows from The Gilly
The Roots, is out to blow up like a clip from out the milli
Or the oo-wop, I do drop, gizzantic, the crew wop
From out the darkest field I goes to pick the funk crop

And the older that I get, the more that I feel wiser

Been Thru The Storm,The Best of The Roots,UnKnown,"Been thru the storm
Through the cold and rain
Everything's still the same
Can't control how I feel
Sometimes it's hard to keep it real
You see the love of your life
With the fortune and fame
Like them Caddilacs with sun-roofs, man
So many ways to make a Dollar, ha!
Sometimes I think about my father
You see my papa was broke and my momma was young
Tryin' to blend in with dem city folk
Everyday landlord knocking down the door

Listen, everybody wanna be famous
I don't give a... how funny the game is
They want it if its gonna be painless
They don't want it if it's gonna be strange
Full of tunnels and changes
I ain't gonna front
Ask my five-year-old son what he want
He said he want the world to know what his name is
I said be smart, boy
And told him he should follow his heart
'Cause if you trying to run from it, it's dangerous
We living in a era where the people is shameless
They gonna do whatever for the paper, you name it
Some come up real smooth
Anybody will try you
Some wanna use you, some wanna be used by you
Don't get it confused, yo
That's the key to survival
Choose your own view
If you don't see it as I do
But it's all substantial
I'm telling you its of the handle
That's the reason I'ma set an example
I've been through...

Yeah! Look, everybody wanna get nice
But everything come at a price, right?
Err'body got their own price
That's something I learned
When people too nice
It's something that they want in return
Nine times out of ten
What they wanting is yearn
Or they just a little concerned
Of something to burn
People talk about respect
That's something that's earned
People that don't wanna give it when they know it's deserved
But it's real hot
And that kinda life they want it now
When the wheel starts spinning
It's tough to slow it down, Black
Wanna get the people involved
And show em how
If they don't wanna tell you the truth
You know it now
It's bout life '
Pressing in pursuit of that paper
And people worldwide on their worst behavior
And folks that was never really movers and shakers
Getting anxious suddenly they wanna be gangsta
But...

Been through the storm

@15,Rising Down,2008.0,"The name of the brother to blame, it's quite plain
It's not the rain but a brother who don't claim or aim
To be a preacher or ordained
I have black thoughts, therefore my name's the same
Don't question my ability, in a studio facility
As I utilize my God-given utility
On time, I get behind and push along a rhyme
Of mine which I design with wealth of mind
Leave MC's blind with amnesia
Chop 'em into salad and my name ain't Caesar
Think twice before you approach
Get benched by the coach, like eggs you're poached
I wrote murder, so you can say it's murder he wrote
You think I'm Hell sent, so you repent to the Pope
Don't walk when the sign says not to
And don't talk when Black Thought's about to
When I say ""Maestro"" and bro starts to play it
If you got a rhyme in your mind, then don't say it
Save it for the weaker, pack your portable speaker
And utilize the treads on your sneaker
Take your sorry crew back and forget about rappin'
Forget you ever saw me and forget this ever happened
Cause you might have nightmares of MC's bein' slain
And I'll be to blame when you go insane",https://genius.com/The-roots-15-lyrics

Is it because he's superficial
Or is he too submissive

Or is it 'cause you really couldn't see a future with him
All he bout is paper, never took the time with you to listen

Meanwhile, Its champagne chilling in ice
You ready for the freakiest stage you done in ya life?

Prepare for flight, this is your captain

Verse 1:
Big respect to the Get fresh, yes

When we came up with the squad that's called The Roots crew
It was me, Qwest Kemal, Hubbard and my man Malik-

Rahzel the Godfather, the entertainer
No other title could fit me plainer
In the past generation, I am the remainder
And I'm also known as the beatbox trainer
Cashin cheques, makin sound effects
After I finish rockin, Black Thought is up next
Well here's a lil' sometin that needs to be heard
Rah, I was headin Uptown, (Word 'Riq), word
(Chillin) and all alone, no one to be with
Hopped up on the train headed for 2-5th
And saw this pretty girl (what?), so I sat beside her
Then she went (*roar*) like she was Tony the Tiger
I said ""Oh no, there's been a mistake
Love, my name is Black Thought, not Frostie Flakes""
(Oh, golly wally) Well, she was raisin hell
She said ""Aah, my name is Maggie but call me Michelle""
*something in reverse*
Check it out, Roots crew and yeah, we rock the house, y'nahI'msayin?

Proceed II,Do This Well: Remixes and Rarities,1994.0,"Welcome to The Roots, The Roots

Check it, check it, Black Thought, is in the house
And uhh, Malik B, is in the house
We're groovin' out, we're groovin' out, yes, in the house
Roy Ayers, is in the house
Yo, my man, my mellow my man, yo, my man, yo, my man
Just get on the mic with your master plan

I can make you dance, I can make you shout
The scripts in the scroll turn the whole party out
Inject my lyrics in a sec with dialect
Why accept? Because it's from the highest eye and depth
Rap extraordinaire, share me never, ever
See-through because I be true, Malik's together
Intox' your cells 'til your brain vein swells
Niggas'll claim terror when they're never parallel
Once I have a hunch to diss MC's that front
I just crunch the whole bunch in one big munch
I always stand firm, under any term
My actions never squirm 'cause my tracks is perm'
I have a tendency to defend this MC
My residency is simply in Pensy
I makes it vivid, on different continents of Earth I pivot
It seems extreme and exquisite, but ask it, is it?
My style is like a cat from a '70s flick
Talkin' jive as he strut with his afro pick
Or a predator just before he stalks his prey
When I talk this way, I do dismay
See, you're puzzled, now, how I think you're tryin' to juggle
My mind is like a 9M double, now there's trouble
The Roots bring you styles and all types of creed
I sign off but I shall proceed

I shall proceed and continue to rock the mic

Yo, we could get fly, we could get fly
We could get fly, that's the anthem of my... crew
Not to glorify, but it's sorta high
Troubles of the world bring tears to my eye, wonder why?
My man can't vaccinate, y'all know the fate
Similar to the way I'm a disease on tape
Within a world of hate, many mics I rape
To escape Metropolis in such a violent state
I spill words over pages, styles over phrases
From the world's different stages, for crowds of different ages
Though not a nova, you Witness like Jehovah
How niggas beg for lyrical plague to pass 'em over
Right? Right, niggas is like stick up kids doin' bids
You got caught, enter the Black Thought
I interface with bass when I communicate
Crowds I elevate to another mind-state of rap thinkin'
See, musically the Black thinkin' izm, therefore
I give 'em what I'm givin', therefore
I give 'em what I'm givin', that's the hardcore
The Roots'll keep it real for sure, and I shall proceed

Absolutely because I'm the kid that's on the mic
And I believe it's destiny that I got put
In a position to throw lyrics like a shotput
Yo no matter the circumstance
Thought can always make you dance
Like you got the heebie-jeebies or a hotfoot
The bass is low on the meter, less than zero
So while I'm sinning you be spinning like a planet
Yo if you dig the shit I'm sayin you'll be deeper
Wish for little and your wishes shall be granted
We plant the seeds y'all, to grow The Roots y'all
And mad knowledge I got, from the archives
But now I got a crazy fat question:
What ever happened to Leonard Parts One to Five?

Why'd you ask me that question? (I don't know)
Where did Leonard Parts One to Five go?
Why'd you ask me that question? (I don't know)

Cause it's on a lower level that I swing low, umm
?uestion, keeps me up, on the swing flow, he
Don't got a whole name, I call him, BRO The
Roots is comin through on your audio
For you to cut The Roots down I don't think so
Because the sound from the ground is like be--low
And when the liquid kicks in then The Roots grow
Now my ace boom coon plus amigo
Was Shadrach Meshach and Abendago
There was a Alpha to Omega, motion, system
But I just call them A to O
And in all states, The Roots'll rock a fat show
Because I drop art like I was Pa-blo
And Pa-blo's last name was Picasso
But as for cash flow, I don't got no
Dividends and, ends to spend on blow, yo

Why'd you ask me that question? (I don't know)
Word, uhh, eah
Where did Leonard Parts One to Five go

Where's the third verse? Here it comes, here it goes
The second had Oodles and Oodles of..
Speaking of O's, I'm hard to sink like a Cheerio
And I speak up loud, so you can hear me yo
Is it A Tribe Called Quest? Is it the JBs?
We're Cool Like Dat, but yo we're not the D.P.'s
It's the group The Roots, with the organic rap style
Plus the groove from the rhythmic rhyme file
Umm.. I'm a big fan of the Soul
But I'm trying to get this Roots shit in control
So I hate when people say
""Umm - you remind me of De La Soul,""
Cause I got a soul, of my own, and umm
Yo The Roots are taking big steps and
You can listen as we progress in
Sometimes I might come to teach a lesson
Other times it's with a crazy question like..
Yo, whatever happened to Leonard Parts One to Five?
Word up; I don't know, anyway, Roots up y'know
Uhh, as we do it like this
Roots up, Roots up
Roots up, Roots up
Roots up, Roots up
Roots up, Roots up
Roots up.. up, Roots up-up
Roots up, Roots up-up
Roots up, Roots up-up
Roots up, Roots _Up From the Ground_
Roots up, Roots up with the sound
Roots up, Roots _Up From the Ground_
Roots up, Roots gettin on down
Roots up, dig it
Roots up y'all, Roots up y'all
Roots is up Roots is up Roots is up y'all
Roots is up y'all, Roots is up y'all
Roots is up Roots is up Roots is up y'all

Common Dust,Organix,1993.0,"Ashes to ashes, and dust to dust (8X)
Chorus: Black Thought (4X)
It's Common Dust y'all, and you don't stop
For you to trust y'all, with real hip-hop

Thought be the pillar of the styles of speech
A dusty head brother mighta saw the bleach
Teach I aims not, just to talk my sense
Damn I gives not, 'bout the consequence
Funk the Stylistics, and jazz the vibe
Laughs at e-tudes cause I'm stayin alive
Time I grips not, so it limps along
Dust you, collect if you digs my song
Paids and black braids what I aims to ease
Connection L-7 throwin out the breeze
Cool breeze to blow up cause I bust the shit
I'm just a sun child rollin in a dustin ship
It's like that y'all

Thought's a Black miss you wanna catch the Crumbs
When I hums a fat song, with derelicts and bums
Smoke gems with the folk from the cellar when they come
Mouth be like cotton, got sticks of gum
Common spear-a-mint, it's like sense is Dust
Accumulation much cause naps I got nuff
Funk feeds the dome see the trees they wanna rise
Out sprouts the ?, free to vocalize
Old school highs I got, for your eyes
Circulize never even though we lock together
Ask the set I'm clever cause I'm severed and I'm pooped
But anyway the wind blows, the Dust you gotta go
Chorus

It's like Crumbs stay at a mic, comes to and from the ashes
Pass the what kid? L-7, we massive
Jazz the funk, slow-be-poke, baby she be glass
Puff the stuff you have now I recline and make you laugh
Roots can boost knot and off the docks I rocked your riches
The Edgar shit is locked, that's, if the force is with us
Yeah, deeps pon the streets I reach, be the sound
A pouch full of ouch, soon the freaks is freakin out, uhh
Threes that make you shout, 'bout, ruckus on the corner
Black, ?uest and Rubber, we did it in the summer
Now the po' folk is near, they say I'm not a Square
But when the circle's Root, Black see if I'll be there
It's like that y'all

Dig it, cool for me I'm glad when I springs from pad
To those with mad Dust I be just a lad
Rock me rocks not cause my Thoughts is Black
Sports the A-di-das plus my proton pack
Accumulatin Dust as my trail mix crush
Digs the naturale, baby flush the blush
Yeah, when it roams, find your way back home
And dig it with the kids with the Dust-y dome
Soon your zigs roam when you brooms the scene
Dust you gots not, cause your rooms is clean
Trust I knows much cause I blows the horn
It's Common Dust y'all, you go on and on

The Ultimate,The Roots Come Alive,1999.0,"*Black Thought speaks and makes crowd respond for a minute and 15 sec.*

Yo my definition is a lyricist for hire
My vocal's a passport that never expire
Crowd loud like fifty rounds of gun fire
Screamin out ""The Roots"" while I balance wit the wire
Yo, expert in this profession, the session
In 1987, I linked up wit the ?uestion
Eleven years later we shared crop wit Geffen
In musical hell, but hip-hop forever heaven
My thoughts, interwoven and deep like Beethoven
This foul world so filled of shit it like a clogged up colon
Swollen wit minds that got stolen
Fake-ass cops, uncontrollable patrolmen
Torture, blood flow like bodies of water
Fathers sexually assaultin they own daughter
Out of sync, outta order like a puzzle
In the land of the unseen hand that hold juggle
In a Game of Life, yo it's hard to roll a double
Tryin times, take lives and separate couples
Kids thinkin they grown, tellin they moms ""Fuck you""
Under they breath, livin in the last times left
Peep the imagery stretch across the sky like a canvas
And we're the artists beneath vigorous rough strokes of darkness
Time to set it off, let's spark this
Switzerland, LET'S SPARK THIS!!
We are the ULTIMATE (rock-rockin it)

You couldn't have a clue, it's about to transpire
The books I buy live arms ?I wire?
The Fifth, similar to ghetto gospel choir
We ex-plore the whole states plus record
In flight buds, trip that was a prisoner in war
Four-four the corridor, seal it, no floor
But I could see the drop was a mile aboard
To the bottom, electrical shock for rhymes
I said ""I don't got em"", guess it kinda presented a problem
When I understood, they said ""Let him go""
I woke, during a center to London-Heathrow
And now wit a past, fuckin wit border patrol
I'm findin it out, I'm leakin wit my people
Hit the studio, spread this information
In daze of frustration fogged the education

The Roots du journ, go check the translation

Hurricane,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Same story, same target, different time
Cyclical reaction from the prisoners of the bilnd
Trying to fight time, it's a battle of the mind
Waiting for redemption, surviving in a bind
Same story, same target, different time
Cyclical reaction from the prisoners of the blind
Trying to fight time, it's a battle of the mind
Waiting for redemption, surviving in a bind
Yo, talk about paying the ultimate price
Hurricane been incarcerated all of his life
Started out at like twelve
Trapped in a belly of hell
Grew into a man inside of a cell
Yo, anger just swell up
At a early age that develop
Hot head and now it ain't shit y'all could tell him
They said he's on a road to become a felon
But instead he swung blows that'll spilt your melon
He did his thing and was the king of the ring, undisputed
Started making noise but they tried to mute it
They put him through it
For him to make the system look stupid, 
They rather look you in the face and shoot it
And leave your spot looted 
Or leave your whole life blank futured and caught
When you scream at it and do it
With sweat leaking from the outline of your soluid
Don't understand the point that you at
Or how the hell you came to it?
Flashback to images of that night, out in Patterson
They pulled him over heading home from a gathering
And when they told him the charge it kind of baffled him
Murder in the first for the champ, we on that again?

Hurricane
Accuse a Hurricane
Ain't change a damned shame

Forever, imagine your locked down forever
Could y'all stand the weather?
Could you hold it together?
You tell me that you know the pain
Yo, imagine if your life was like a hurricane, a hurricane
Forever, imagine your locked down forever
Could ya'll stand the weather?
You built for that weather?
Yo, know what'm saying?
Know what'm saying?
You gotta fight for what you believe in
Nobody knows the troubles seen
This flick left me wondering
'What can become of kings and young kids?'
Summer dream deferred, incident occured, freedom blurred
A freedom that would only be retrieved again in words, later on
The cops, y'all know what they be on
A nigga's life is like a field that they play upon, away and gone from
Natural lifer, a soul he had to fight
Learn it himself, sleep days, stay up half the night
Amongst dead man walking, he got afterlife exercising
Developing his knack to write
Never leaving his cell, in this world he trapped himself
What he loved on the outside world, detached himself
You know the cards Blacks get dealt by the system
He drew a picture of freedom with many dimensions
This picture proved to be bigger than Black and White
A young soul named Lesra brought him back to life
It's amazing to a man what a book could do
And how certain books seem to look for you
This is the story of a champion's fall and rise
The story left me wiping my eyes
Peace Ru

Yes, I am the inescapable, the irresistible
The unnegotiable, the unchallenged 
I am time
I scroll in measurements, control the elements
I hold the evidence, I tell the story 
I am time
I know no prejudice, I bare no sentiments
For wealth or settlement, I move forward 
I am time
You can't recover me, conceal or smuggle me
Retreat or run from me, crawl up or under me
You can't do much for me besides serve
Me well and have good dividends returned to you
Or attempt to kill me off and have me murder you
Many have wasted me but now they are facing me
Treated me unfaithfully and now endure me painfully
Plaintively, I wait to see what history will shape to be
Who's hearts will never die inside the sake of me
Angel's scribe the page for me
Keep a full account of all the names for me
And make a special mark for Hurricane who (?) patiently

Just imagine if your life was like a hurricane

The clouds clashed and the heaven's gave birth to star
God placed it in a man on the day he was born
Convicted minutes after, a true natural disaster
Framed for manslaughter, the Hurricane Carter rising
From out the south water, like torrential rains
In the ring no opponent escaped unscathed
You can't believe the world we live in's injust
All I see is more proof, there's no place for us
They had my man Carter locked in a cage, like an animal
Drive him to the point where the mind work mechanical
Or works by remote control
It was done to all of us, they tapped directly into our soul
Either it's sing-sing, or it's bars around your mind
There's no where to run, no where to hide
In a six-by-six a guilty man cries
For repentance and lost is what innocence is
Same story, same target, different time
Cyclical reaction from the prisoners of the bilnd
Trying to fight time, it's a battle of the mind
Waiting for redemption, surviving in a bind
Same story, same target, different time
Cyclical reaction from the prisoners of the blind
Trying to fight time, it's a battle of the mind
Waiting for redemption, surviving in a bind

Your life was like a hurricane, a hurricane
Forever, imagine behind bars forever
Could you stand the weather?
You built for that? Is you cut for that?
Don't be telling me that you know the pain
Your life was like a hurricane, yo

They almost got caught but made it to the hood
Cersei's looking for her daughter but this chick
Was taken out by some poisonous lipstick
The Dragon mother Khaleesi caught by the Dothrakians
And sent to the land of widows, real far from happy
Arya got in a blind fight, beat up badly
I can feel the whole game start to heat up sadly

The Lesson Part 3 (It’s Over Now),The Roots Come Alive,1999.0,"Well it's the boul Riq' Gees, thoroughbred from Philly
My name Black Thought, my girl's the Black LILIES
Some people try to front like ""I ain't feelin it really""
But that's silly, cuz how the fuck you can't feel me?
When I first felt it, I knew it had to be dealt wit
Alot of ice-grillin in the house got melted
Some tried to put up a fight, but they was helpless
You ain't try to turn that loose, you too selfish
Gimme that, guess who bringin the ""Get busy"" back
Women say the sound of my voice, the Afrodisiac
Okayplayer.com, where you can hit me at
E-me and when I'm in your town, come see me
The Real World for real, this ain't your MTV
The illest INNERVISIONS since Stevie on wax
My vocal like syrup over forty-eight tracks
The fact of the matter is a matter of fact
That it's the Black Thought, controllin like Ike Turner
You wanna get wise, you best to be a fast learner
Or just relax and peep how it's done
And boogie ya ass to what's about to come because
Chorus *singing*
It was on, now it's not, you poor child
We got it locked, it's over now

Aiyyo Dice's flows, hit idiots like crossbows
Knock em out the atlas, push em off the atlas
I'm laugin, lookin down from off top the totem
Hop off my pedastall, grab my scrotum
Aiyyo y'all niggas ain't FUCKIN wit this shit
(I told em) Aiyyo y'all ain't FUCKIN wit the Roots crew (I told em)
The rap is a riot yeah cuz my family bouncin
Soon as the name, Dice Raw is announced in
The arena, the grass is greener on the other side
I hit the stores, twenty-five thousand die
Now tell who the best in off the top in the world
I'll give you a hint, the same guy that's fuckin your girl
I just didn't have parents, The Roots found me in the trash
But still, a nigga got a lot of class
Drink wit my pinky-finger up off the glass
Keep talkin shit homeboy, that's your ass
Chorus

It's just the simple part of the gam(e)
I guess it's just the art of the scam
Check for your soul cuz it departed again
M-ill-i-tant is atomic, you fall from the sky just like a comet
Move out till the bottom of my shoes out
How many tracks do you bout?
How many of these niggas you doubt?
How many of these ladies makin you shout?
You on a mission so listen to this
Ask yourself what condition is this
Sick in the ?wist?, I rap on a satellite disk
You gotta like this, askin me about the way that I stroll
About the way I enfold, in scrambling mode
You're like that, don't bark cat, bite back
What up Blood? Is things still the same in the hood?
While I sit I gotta get dub, and wish I could plug
They thoughts'll leave em stiff in the mud, you wannabe thug
In section eight, houses were hush up under the rug
The shit I spit is hummin wit slugs, get soaked in the suds

Uh, I get up
Read the mornin' paper, kiss my baby girl
Tell my lady friend I'm gone 'til I save the world
Jump in my Hot Rod wheel, lookin' super thorough
Rockin' a long black cape like the Duke of Earl
My cool don't drop, I spit where the future twirl
I smash glass in my hands to produce a pearl
I do the James on stage, then I do the 
You can tell I'm bonafide live, 'cause I'm too fo' real
So the truth prevail, I never fail
Ask me to key the blaze in the trail
I never tell, like the digits on the check in the mail
I give 'em hell with the clever rhymes
In the squad situated 
White on white shelltoes throwin' elbows
You wanna holla?
You can do the rebel yell, bro

Popcorn Revisited,Organix,1993.0,"Pass the what? Pass the popcorn (8X)
Yo, I wrote this, basement,
 Never Never Tunnel type portion
Just to accompany some audio distortion
Bust the popcorn, drop it ons my cassette and
Yo Crumbs, umm, how you feel? I hope it's blessed man
Dig The Square Roots be the setters of examples
Findin mad rhythm in the static of your samples
Quick to make you move to my groove as I soothe
The ear of the listener on the musical
Prisoner G, now you're free you can be all you wanna be
Go where you want or go and see all you wanna see
Because yo, your ambitions I won't neglect
And to them brothers who ain't here, nuff respect
So BROther Quest, how ya livin, what ya givin black?
To me the brother with the linens and the applejacks;
Busy til the break of dawn
The first 
verse is born
 I pass the popcorn
Pass the what? Pass the popcorn (4X)
Say what?
Pass the what? Pass the popcorn (4X)
Secondly, I speak for the ?uest from the 
S-Q-T (Square Roots)
And I'm Black Thought, therefore you know it's funky
The rhythms he recycles sometimes prehistoric
The mic for the popcorn's like metaphoric (it's metaphoric baby)
So many different factors in a ?uestion style
Cause he's the father and he's giving more than one child
The abstract soloist, drummin from the heart
All the way from Philly in the West part
Relax your mind and let your body be at rest
Flow in slow mo', and let the BROther manifest
Now the second verse has been born
I'm Black Thought and I pass the popcorn
On to Kid Crumb I pass the popcorn
Pass the what? Pass the popcorn (4X)
Say what?
Pass the what? Pass the popcorn (4X)
From the Southern section of Philly my affection
Affiliates me with kids, from the store to pastry
The Foreign Object, direct from ? with the skit
That be rugged, it was the drumsticks and the buckets
Back in the days, now the Rubber Band plays to accompany
?uestion upon the drums and displays mad soul
Soul be the source of the blam Roots fam
As we grow and expand like the afro
With menacing music seriously I'm sinister
I shout, move about, turn it out like minister
Diggin the flip-side when I slide I gets biz with
Mad melanin, chocolate, like a chip that's black man
From the dark room with the mad raps homegrown
Knots and knaps upon the dome from thinkin
I'm sinkin in the sound cause I gets and got down
Lettin Black Thought's out of lockdown, buckshot
Lick it to the tick of my measure's on the Richter
Grits getter so grab your sister
I get wreck so check my respect from the wreck
That I've gotten biting this'll make your fronts turn rotten
The original, rock chewer, from a duo
Whatever called po' folkers or Crumbs, and his mouth broke
Kids wanna laugh so I blast on your ass to - wait see
Chase me and see if you catch the circular knot
Style buckwild the acoustic boom
Square Root of Black Thought broadcast with the popcorn
It's like that y'all
The popcorn popcorn as I pass y'all
I go..

A'yo everybody on they jawns
Cartoons is hardcore porn
It ain't no afterschool paper routes and mowin lawns
Kids got backpacks full of yayo and heron
Coming to school shootin up the auditorium
Yo its anthrax maniacs on the TV
The least of y'all worries should be Thought's cd
The chairman of the board coppin twice weekly
They done caught the minister with a pork b.l.t
If my shit ain't hot, it probly try to drive me
Psyhce, its somethin I can never let myself see
Can't see, I'm thorough-bread, nothin fancy
The maker, no matter what the circumstance be
Its the principle, pillowcase full of nickel
Smacked like I'm (??), leave him crippled
Keep talkin greasey I'ma big lip you
A'yo your man'll can get slid with you
You and the squad takin to galoshes
I hold the engineer for hostage
And spit from a dirty cartridge
Its L for whoever try to front on Thought's shit
I'm sendin them goons to your mom's apartment


A'yo I'm dancin, on the edge of insanity
And rhymin like its the end of humanity
Still people from the old neighborhood can't stand to see me
Turn around and tell girls we like family
What up with all that, jokin, and collamity
Behind the laughter they thinkin about jammin me
But they don't know, I got somethin for them
But I ain't with that negative vibe, so fuck all that
I've earned alot from this game, and sacrificed more
Stand here a new man, but I'm still the old boy
They claimin they sell but I'm still the old boss
Sometimes wings get clipped, we all hit the floor
But today though, its Black Thought, Kweli and Raw
You can be sure that we got our eyes on y'all
Watchin different artists rise and fall
Mother fuckers jumpin ship like we came to rob at y'all


Kweli, sittin back in the cut like Reese
In a constant peace, call me fantastic like I cut the grease
Baracudas movin and canoein sippin amaretto
I'm a ruler of my temple, what I do to instrumentals
Instrumentals is the development of these niggas mentals
Tears in your eyes like this moment is sentimental
Your fundamentally floored, philosophically bored
Disturbed like the eighth floor of your hospital ward
You've GOT to appoint niggas to raise the bar
Muslims praise Allah, Christians praise the God
Rastas, they say Jah
They find a way to rhyme with the pallet like fine wine
And make you say ahhh
Guess who's back?
The game needed improvement
Can't spit the bullshit no more, you sound stupid
I'm a shark in the water with constant movement
Influenced by music since a truant yo
This is how we do it yo

Rhythm that get your mind thirsty
When I rock it's something to see
Something to see, something to see

With the same two hundred funky people packed together

Reminiscent of the Middle Passage only now we, gliiiide
Over oceans of steel, and at the speed of light

Would you mind not dripping your umbrella into my lap?

Man you better change your mind, change your plan
Change your attitude, change your ideas to change your position
As I change my seat, and I change the channel on my WatchMan

Miracles happen when you don’t let nothing hurt your spirit

The fact that I’m still here is product of perseverance
I’m not the same as any other artist don’t compare us
I’m the loudest
The clearest
The proudest
The nearest
To a track record that flawless
Minus the smoke and mirrors
I’m too careful, to be careless
I’m out here close to fearless
How I made it?
I played it safe until I elevated
Now that wait has been my saving grace

Arrival of the realest
Cup that never runneth over It’s too valuable to spill it
If you bout your business, I can show you how to go and get it
If you not committed, you just hold this ‘L’ and know your limit

Now this one is dedicated to the good the bad and the desolated. And The
Roots crew you know them lyrically orientated program you lose in life
Instantly ? we're like acid we burn you. Watch a rude bwoy now
Black Thought:
Yo you should see some of these cats that vocalize
They get props from they local guys and try to raise
Speaching through the mic like ""Yo I apologize""
They blind and wasn't as wise and fail to realize the com-
Plectual sexual side of the rhyme
When I make love to the mic the crowd respond
Your promoter love the vocal over dub when I control the club
So throw your hands up in the air show your love
We waste not the bangingest beats but make use
The Roots get you open like parachutes
Yo who in the house only deal with hip hop that's authentic?
Back to renovate your state of mind for a minute
It's I, Bad Lieutenant represent Phi-la
Delphia empire fifth dynasty
Your third eye couldn't wait for you to relate to what I activate
While the fake spectate
I'm less than impress-ed for beyond stressin'
And battle as a reveloutionary adolescent
But now in the present with fake masters of ceremonies yo that's phoney
You'll get capped with colonial force that of a cannon
Examinin the compact disc to start rammin'
To put the diagram in effect and get fly
On immature MC's who try
Wake 'em up outta they High School High
Shakny Don:
Yo bumbading bumdadabedang
The Roots crew boy we mash things again
Bumbading ripapadededang The Roots crew bwoy we runnin' back again
Bumbading dumdadadedang The Roots boy dem run the island
Bumbading ripadededang look ? I mash up the scene
Malik B (M-illa-tant):
I blast off the roof to prove she lay in there blazed
Enslaved by the soundwaves as the skills amaze
Insight skin type analytic cause I live it
My cerebral pivot over your style like ""give it""
The lyricism I'm contemplatinng your neighborhood or legion
Brutalize your section stalk your whole region
When you blink it's hell then you drink Zinfandel
You wonder what's goin' inside of my thinkin' cells
We bomb like militias I'm trying to stack riches
Look first comes the money the power then the (?)
They all will bring you down but I Milliant the sound
With a bargaid of pirate raps that's running through your town
Surrounded by a wise dome my ledge knows horizons
I keep at a distance confused and feel cyclones
You know I'm trying to make it because I probably take it
Hustlin' stickin' pickin' it or scrape it
Tracks appeal that's why I'm trying to mack a mil
I stay sedated worth a Zantac that's a pill
It gets hectic that's why niggas try to exit
Stress relates to those who walk around protected

Yo bumbading ripadingdedingdedang
The Roots crew man dem mash up the scene

Naw nigga what's up then? Thanks for the man outroduction
Go ask your girl inside my world is the duction
No frontin' finger on the button of destruction
Play nice like entice and keep your styles on the hush and
Step inside the illafifth dungeon
Where it smells of pungent
The underwater the brotherly lovin'
Where crabs get knocked out respect from
Brought back to the lab were the scientist will dissect 'em
The old heads sniffin' start bitchin' when we testin'
Interupting my class when my class is in session
Was when I manifestin' or come to teach a lesson
What's inside of my dome I'll have all you clones guessin'
Lets begin as the color gets tossed in with the pen
It feels good that's when you know it's a sin
Everytime I rhyme I might get charged for murder
Slicing your back with rap turn a brain into burger
Lyrically I shot with radioactive waves
Like Kolby and Cosmic Kev on fridays
Your styles older than Yoda we on the top of ?
Claim to gettin' over but you ain't makin' quota

You looking for direction girl, I feel your vision on me
Just dont let him see you sweatin, we ain't 'spose to be involved
Knowing when we get it off, girl I mean it all
Keeping you fiending 'til you taken and tossed
And when I'm breaking it off, its no denying the fact - it's wrong
Cause you got a man who's probably playing his part
You probably breaking his heart, He trying to figure the reason you gone
Is it cause he's superficial, or is he too submissive
Or did I come along and hit you with the futuristic
Or is it cause you really couldn't see a future with him
All he about is paper, never took the time with you to listen
You want it gripped up, flipped, and thrown
An' get stripped and shown, the way to get in the zone - of course
...Dealing with this won't be taking a loss
You need to leave him alone
And roll with the one who breaking you off...


Rollin down the highway, listening to Sade sing
The way the ""Smooth Operator"" move my way
You sitting beside me looking like Friday Foster
Pam Grier structure - look at your body
Keep each other thirsty, kisses like Hershey
But lips is sealed cuz we don't need a controversy
I say I'm in town, you say you want it in the worst way?
You probably told your man it was your mother's birthday
Meanwhile it's champagne chillin in ice
You ready for the freakiest things you've done in your life
We break it down like road dogs pulling a heist
You makin sounds like the vibe gotcha reaching your height
Prepare for flight, this is your captain I'm getting strapped in
There's no denying the strength that it's attraction - girl
Working with this you won't be taking a loss
So stop fooling your man
And roll with the one who's breaking you off

Baby, baby, baby... Don't you worry bout (no babe)

Seek peace of mind, through mental peacefulness
Peacefulness, peacefulness, peace-ful-ness
Is in the mind of the beholder
Behold, my mental piece
Could shatter your peace, to pieces
Pieces and portions of rhythmic distortion relax me
The echos reverb and feedback of reality disturb my peace
Forcing me to retreat, to the below beneath
Down a step and a step and a step and a step
And a step beyond
To a level of my own
Private, mystic, ritualistic, culturalistic sanity
Yet some say that I am insane
Is that not ironic? My soul not sonic
As I flow through the tonic, of life I find
That the strife behind, that pushes and pulls
And pulls and pushes me
Into all of the bullshit that I experience from day to day
Is the reason.. for my search, or journey, or struggle
To find.. the broken pieces of the sign
That combine, to form the crooked line
That we call.. peace y'all",https://genius.com/The-roots-peace-lyrics

Welcome to The Roots, The Roots
Check it, check it, Black Thought, is in the house
And uhh, Malik B, is in the house
We're groovin out, yes in the house
*discordant talk*
Just get on the mic with your master plan

I can make you dance, I can make you shout
The scripts in the scroll turned the whole party out
Inject my lyrics in a sec with dialect
Why accept, because it's from the highest eye and depth
Rap extrordinaire share me never ever
See through because I be true, Malik's together
Intox your cells till your brain vein swells
Niggas'll claim terror when their never parellel
Once I have a hunch that there's MC's that front
I just crunched a whole bunch, in one big munch
I always stand firm, under any term
My actions never squirm cuz my tracks is perm
I have a tendency to defend this MC
My residency is simply in sensei
I makes it vivid, on different continents of earth I pivot
It seems extreme and exquisite but ask it is it
My style is like a cat from a seventies flick
Talkin jive as he strut with his afro pick
Or a predator, just before he stalks his pray
When I talk this way, I do dismay
See you're puzzled, now how I think you're trying to juggle
My mind is like a nine M double, now there's trouble
The Roots bring you styles and all types of creed
I sign off but I shall proceed

I shall, proceed, and continue, to rock the mic
I shall, proceed, and continue, to rock the mic
I shall, proceed, and continue, to rock the mic
I shall, proceed, and continue, to rock the mic

Yo, we could get fly, we could get fly
We could get fly that's the anthem of my
Crew not to glorify but it's sorta high
Troubles of the world bring tears to my eye wonder why
My man, can't vaccinate, y'all know the fate
Similar to the way I'm a disease on tape
To escape Metropolis is such a violent state
I spill words over pages, styles over phrases
From the world's different stages for crowds of different ages
Though not a nova, you witness like Jehovah
Now niggas beg for lyrical plague to pass them over
Righ right niggas is like stick up kids
Doin bids you got caught, enter the Black Thought
I interface with bass when I communicate
Crowds I elevate, to another mindstate of
Rap thinking, see musically the Black thinking rhythm
Therefore, I give em what I'm giving, therefore
I give em what I'm giving that's the hardcore
The Roots'll keep it real for sure, and I shall proceed

Rockin on the microphone I do this well (repeats)

To my man Big Shawn, you got it goin on, now, yo
You got The Roots in the house
We also got Bahamadia in the house, representin lovely
With you ears now proceed
It's flavor you wouldn't believe as we proceed
Chorus:
I shall... proceed... and continue... to rock the mic (2X)
Verse One: Malik B
Let's, kill all the small talk, and just elaborate
The Roots collaborate I see myself as rather great
How the words generate, whole crews disintergrate
When I pentrate
As if in the course flow with intensive force
You best to go and check your source about my textual course
Simplicity, it sounds complex, you might miss it
But after you critique it you can kiss it
I'm assissting fire force that leaves statistics
When identify niggas simplify you'll feel no sympathi
My lyrics send you on a permanent excursion
I never would decide when your lifespan was submergin
My style is urban not surburban when I'm splurgin
Gosh these MC's I wash more than detergent
I can split the Red Sea but deadly
Take heed, illadelph style as I proceed
Chorus
Verse Two: Bahamadia
Bahamadia hits the melodies mellowly
Brand new, funk doobie, choosy with the tactics
When I gets Raw, like Dice
, nice
With the flavor, 
Do You Want More?!!!??!
Of the Organix
, pure
Eargasmatic, from Distortion to Statics
Automatic, systematic
I'm nasty at it
So hand me the five micraphones like they did Illmatic
One time for the mind
Rhyme be coming from an illadelph state of mind
The real is not whole or half time
All the time, and I shall proceed
I'm movin on baby, I shall proceed
To remain, on point like an infrared beam
Succeed, in chasing out the ultraviolet dreams
No Mas like Shorty, cuz it's all about me
Chorus
Verse Three: Black Thought
Black and handsome, holdin MC's for ransome
Thoughts command some, is this, a phantom?
Crews I mangle, y'all know my anthem ain't the Star Spangled
I hit you from the most bizarre angle, rectangular
Visions of papes my mind conceive
Motivatin me to acheive as I must proceed
When I ride the train, traumatized to maintain
But laid back, the tracks can relax the brain
I got to deal with everything on this intelligent plain
Servin as a killer
To the pain 
I live a High Life like Miller
Me and the mic's mechanized
Respect recognize with mind beyond wise
Limitless when I bless the mic with speak
Dialect never weak, y'all niggas know Tarik
From seven-fifth Snider Ave. got the flavor you need
For the ingredients indeed so to the lead I shall proceed

The Lesson Part 1,UnKnown,1995.0,"Lyrically versatile
My rap definition is wild
I wrote graffiti as a juvenile
Restin on deuce trey
And used to boost gray Kangol's
With 555 Soul's from the streets
Of the Ill-a-delphiadaic insane
For monetary gain, niggas is slain on the train
It's homicide
For wealth stealth missions for crack
In the alleyways, where niggas get grazed in the back
From stray shots
Clips with hollow tips, for your spine or
Either remain calm, catch a rhyme, to your mind
Niggas ya know my style
I run a--motherfuckin-rap--muk
When Malik get a U-Haul truck
I stand five, foot seven, in command of the party
And scam like Uncle Sam
I'm never caught up in the glass eye
Of your action cam, cause I'm down low
Artistic exquisite rap pro, that get the dough
It's the Philly borough dread
Thoroughbread for dolo
I bag solo, like a nigga that boost Polo
Steppin through the corridor, of metaphors
Lookin over my left
Shoulder the mic, still feel colder than before
With this jazz shit I hit your jaw
Dice Raw, get up on the mic, my young poor
I be the nigga blowin up the spot on tour
Surely real to the core, old school like eighty-four
I never die, and raps till my lungs collapse
Then relax until my knack for tracks
Bring it back, on time
When I rhyme my rep remain
Either go against the grain or your ass is found slain
I overcome, niggas want styles then I throw you some
Show you some, get on the mic and take it over son
Dice Raw, the motherfuckin Wild Noid
Get on the mic and perpetratin is void

Ya leave niggas missin in action like their dads in the projects
My style like an old mac, travel round and catch wreck
I'm ill versatile, with the skill no more
Wack MC's wanna flex but their styles they bore
Got to know the real meaning of the ill shit, kid
I do mad damage but never will catch a bid
With my knapsack, full of ill shit that I just boosted
From the corner store when I let loose more
Flavor that's me, rippin heads off from the seams
Niggas didn't play like Jeru and Come Clean
(he heh ha ha ha) I beat down on they heads like drum machines
Or 808's cause my style flows out great
And superspectac, with all the raw rap
Pull a metal chair out my knapsack across your back ka-crack
Now do you feel the pain of course
I guess you're believin that I'm insane
When I'm taggin my name, upon the train I got so much pride
I got so much soul, with lyrics high
To make niggas stop drop and roll, now check me out one time
For your ass, fat styles equivalent
Of an AIDS infected Glock blast
Niggas know my style, plus they know they want more
Props from Mount Vernon, to Mount Rushmore
OK kid, you know my style is buckwild literature
That you can never get when I'm thinkin your particular
Flavor that you want
I sit back and smoke a fat blunt in class
Teachers can kiss my ass, I'm twice, Dice
Nigga de Raw, never take a bad fall
Smack your head up against the wall
Like playin handball, my style's ill
I slam like Hulk Hogan, Dice Raw bettin on my arm
Niggas know my slogan while I breathe your last breath
Niggas better watch they step, fat bull catch wreck
Ill, gots ta keep you in check
With the hellified beats and hard rhymes
Niggas know my style, when I go the whole nine
I beat down punks, cut em up into fruit chunks
Like fruit salad, my style's smooth like white owl
Blunts, so whatcha want if you got beef then come get it
If ya don't well then forget it
My rap style's exquisite, I'm Raw Daddy
Like niggas with no Trojans on the stage when I rhyme
I gots ta keep, my composure
Where I'm from it's like a whole different world
Hoppin a train honeydip and I'ma snatch your squirrel
Most corrupt, motherfucker in the tenth grade
Juvenile cause Jeff McKay could not fade
Don't ask me honey I'm not the one for stressin
If you wanna know better ask BR.O.Th.E.R ?
Cause he know the time like I know the time

Capture the metaphoric phrase blasted off stage when I tour
I am but a messanger born to blow up
My niggas knew it all the time, lyrically I was a dime
At the age of nine, shorty Black, could rhyme
On the mic I never wasted time, I'm, the exquisite wizard
When I visit shorties I hit it I'm cool as a blizzard
Nigga what? You wanna bust your fronts, with the butter, my
Black paper chase ya and then erase ya rhyme
Sucker, MC's how I hate it when you waste your time
My state of mind, shine like it's diamond studded
I'm rhyme budded on stage, word is bond, when I'm on, I rage
Got the 12 gauge at the rest so play, and into rest you lay
My everyday M.O. is gettin dough cause times is rougher
Than a mother for brothers to scuffle shuffle your cards kid
Cause the odds is, niggas'll hustle and live, foul
This wild environment hostile produce, the music in me
So my style's the blend of what is and was
You could get a buzz from it, but enter too deep
And reach a summit you fall and then plummit beyond real
Where you're killed if your raps ain't ill
Another crab motherfucker 'nother cap to peel
Through these amps, I motivate camps to dance

I'm takin heads because, there's no fuckin ledge
I pledge allegiance to my cosmic guide
I couldn't fit in three dimensions if I tried
Civilizations I can delete, so crews don't bother me
Battle with Jehovah gaining universal soveirgnty
Niggas run around like clones, I got planets and thrones
Throughout the galaxy my name's well known (my name's well known)

And my grammar, might do a mandatory life in slammers
You should regret it, thinkin about steppin to me
Niggas forget it - you'll get gassed with lyrics leaded
Most energetic, I never snag I'm tightly threaded
I flip scripts like pattern twistness in calisthetics

Tactical tracks match perfectly with graphical stats

That tackles you back and shackles and laughs at you
That's...the mathematical madness I'm on, the savage, the strong
The marriage, a bond of havoc and song

There's lotsa hateful skeletons locked
In the closet of my castle of Grayskull
I'm possum at grade school, that's why I have to debate you
My raps are like Capel, slashin' your face, you
That's how a master degrades you

I'm snatchin' his halo
God I pray that you send my father back as an angel
Language is fatal and it's hypnotizin'

Dancin' double dutch and all sayin' nothin' much

Your squad chest swell up, still you're mini-ay-ture to me
Nature-ally I bring the extremity
Musically intense with the globe in suspense
Contemplatin' where the world traveler been since

Dear god 2.0 - single version,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Dear God, I'm trying hard to reach you
Dear God, I see your face in all I do
Sometimes it's so hard to believe it
But, God, I know you have your reasons
(Uh huh)
They said, ""he's busy, hold the line, please""
Call me crazy, I thought maybe he could mind read
Who does the blind lead? Show me a sign, please
If everything is made in China, are we Chinese?
And why do haters separate us like we Siamese?
Technology turning the planet into zombies
Everybody all in everybody's dirty laundry
Acid rain, earthquakes, hurricane, tsunamis
Terrorists, crime sprees, assaults, and robberies
Cops yellin', ""stop, freeze,"" shoot him before he try to leave
Air quality so foul, I gotta try to breathe
Endangered species and we runnin' out of trees
If I could hold the world in the palm of these
Hands, I would probably do away with these anomalies
Everybody checkin' for the new award nominee
Wars and atrocities; look at all the poverty
Ignoring the prophecies, more beef than broccoli
Corporate monopoly, weak world economy
Stock market topplin'
Mad marijuana, Oxycontin, and Klonopin
Everybody out of it?
Well, I've been thinkin' about
And I've been breakin' it down
Without an answer
I know I'm thinking out loud
But if you're lost and around
Why do we suffer?
Why do we suffer?
(Uh huh)
Yeah, it's still me, one of your biggest fans
I get off work, right back to work again
I probably need to go ahead and have my head exam
Look at how they got me on the Def Jam payment plan
Well, I'm in the world of entertainment and
Trying to keep a singing man sane for the paying fans
If I don't make it through the night, slight change of plans
Harp strings, angel wings, and praying hands
Lord, forgive me for my shortcomings
For going on tour and ignoring the court summons
All I'm trying to do is live life to the fullest
They sent my daddy to you in a barrage of bullets
Why is the world ugly when you made it in your image?
And why is livin' life such a fight to the finish?
For this high percentage when the sky's the limit
A second is a minute, every hour's infinite
Dear God, I'm trying hard to reach you
Dear God, I see your face in all I do
Sometimes it's so hard to believe it",https://genius.com/The-roots-dear-god-20-single-version-lyrics
Hardware,UnKnown,UnKnown,"(Do it right.)
Chorus
Pull out the hardware
Let's do it right (right.)
Aiyyo, do it right y'all
Here we go, check it out
Subzero, cold from the Krush intro
The temperature alone shatter weatherproof window
We move at adrenaline rush tempo
And leave y'all rappers screamin' about
Who stepped on toes and cut ya throat
So what, you can't fuck wit though
You know it's me and that poetry to add injury to insult
When Thought begin
The what and the when
The why and the when
A be explained
Music ease the pain
Seize the brain
The flow's like sex in the rain
Hit 'em like they hit the projects wit the crane
Hit 'em like they hit the black man wit the blame
Hit the people like I'm bustin a gauge wit good aim
Tell 'em bang this, dangerous masterpiece
It's not a game to heat, pulsate through each vein
Stimulate the ghetto, that's the reason 'Riq came
It feel so surreal it's hard to keep sane
Unplug me, seems like it's raw, get ugly
I come to operate, just shine the spotlight on me
Just make a little noise if the crowd love me
The way I do it make these other rappers sound funny
Chorus (2x)
Do it right y'all
Yo, do it right y'all
Yo it's like wassup, everybody wanna get nice
But everything come at a price
It's like everybody got they own vice, mine weed and the mic
And women that I need in my life
Some strung out on religion and believing in christ
Next man need the money, stay pullin a heist
While this other wanna fiend, stay huffin the pipe
While this next wanna fiend, stay fuckin ya wife
Try to give the youth advice, and guiding light
Young boys in the street getting high tonight
Young brothers upstate hype, tryin to fight
Real bitter cause they niggas ain't fly my kite
What I do is for them chain cigarette smoke heads wit bad nerves
Old men in the barbershop using bad words
For people in the darkness, unseen and heard, for HIP-HOP
Don't get the meanin slurred
My flow disturbed
Presence is the most preferred
I descend upon Japan in a (?glowing bird?)
Talk hustle, about 4 million served
Still swerve, directing y'all, life spills, word jus
Chorus (2x)
Do it right y'all
Yo, do it right y'all
Aiyyo, when the fifth come thru it's like amazing grace
Slow motion like you in some shit that may have been laced
Standoff at the door when I step in the place
It's like the law comin' try and pepper spray in your face
If you a weak nigga stay in ya place
My name 'Riq, when I speak
Thoughts travel at alarming rates
Come on, stomp wit The Roots
I step into the vocal booth
Armed to the tooth
Cause the people want truth
We all want clothing and food, and wanna root
So I stand up say what I say in front of you
Comin thru, feelin something new, chill for a few
I know you probably wanna keep it real for ya crew
So pull out the hardware, do what you tryin to do
So I can grab the mic, and do what I'm dyin to do
The turntableist, Krush on the 1 and 2
And it ain't no need to tell you my name, you know 'Riq jus

Or is it my one track mind?
With the same two hundred funky people packed together
On one car that seats sixty
Reminiscent of the Middle Passage only now we, gliiiide
Over oceans of steel, and at the speed of light
From the window, in my eye, I can't see
Damn! Brother, excuse me brother
Would you mind not dripping your umbrella into my lap?
Now where was I? What, change to spare?
Man you better change your mind, change your plan
Change your attitude, change your ideas to change your position
As I change my seat, and I change the channel on my WatchMan
Just in time, special guest, The Roots, on the

John Coltrane and chinese food is my date for the night

With that lady, with that woman, with that child

Kid, two-one-five, two-one-five
What? Black Thought in the house
Representin the Roots, y'all know how we do
Proceed Beatminerz remix one time for your mind
It's on
Verse One: Black Thought
Yo, I never sweat it, it's all copacetic
In this lyrical profession rappers I discredit
It's fact that a fraction of the rap population
Is pathetic not thorough
Here come the kid that's got it like Al Jarreau
I restin in the wild burough where it's
All realism never fiction
And ghettoes is forever friction
Clash for cash gettin status and crabs is froze
Caught up in the mixing
The mic's my only apparatus
And with it I got rappers paranoid
Lyrical freakazoid, leapin out the terror void
Guard your era it's the Black Thought ain't nothing lesser
Than the MC oppressor, poetry professor
I pound this MC on my dresser got my mind on trauma
So my persona's marijuana most melodic with the melodrama
The Ben Frank folder
, the mic holder
Command it with a planet on my shoulder till the sound's over
Keep it underground my style subterranean
Ill Philadelph Pennsylvanian
Back on the tour to entertrain again, whoops
I meant to say to entertain I'm in a planetary mode
Watch as I explode through your area code with dialect
Y'all niggas know the time when the Thought catch wreck
Y'all niggas know the science on the Dice Raw and Malik B
Kid I'm nice y'all searchin for a beat
It's the master of literature that's pure
You're checkin for
Coming down I keep it real and hardcore
Y'all know the score
Four four that's the major, Black Thought I got
The flavor you need
And I shall proceed
Chorus:
*Beatminerz cut and scratch the chorus of Proceed*
Verse Two: Malik B
I can make you dance, I can make you shout
The scripts in the scroll turned the whole party out
Inject my lyrics in a sec with dialect
Why accept, because it's from the highest eye and depth
Rap extrordinaire share me never ever
See through because I be true, Malik's together
Intox your cells till your brain vein swells
Niggas'll claim terror when their never parellel
Once I have a hunch that there's MC's that front
I just crunched a whole bunch, in one big munch
I always stand firm, under any term
My actions never squirm cuz my tracks is perm
I have a tendency to defend this MC
My residency is simply in sensei
I makes it vivid, on different continents of Earth I pivot
It seems extreme and exquisite but ask it is it
My style is like a cat from a seventies flick
Talkin jive as he strut with his afro pick
Or a predator, just before he stalks his pray
When I talk this way, I do dismay
See you're puzzled, now how I think you're trying to juggle
My mind is like a nine M double, now there's trouble
The Roots bring you styles and all types of creed
I sign off but I shall proceed

Scully down creepin' while you tilted off Henny

Invade your brain wit the collision causing division

Sweep your sector, leavin' you niggas for stool-pigeons
My religion is a way of life, but the trife replays
Cuz niggas actin' shiest these days
Wagin' wars, usin' dynamics cuz I'ma slam it
You talkin' all this out out your mouth, you satanic
Roam the planet, always takin' bullshit for granted
Just a cool type of cat but you still can't understand it
You told to sit back, stand still and chill
Niggas bound to clap shots cuz they all act ill
Wit a sour-ass taste smilin' up in your face
I'm like trust, never leavin' no trial or no trace
Disappear wit the wind, ? shows the discipline

About the way I enfold in scrambling mode

I'm assistin' fire force that leaves statistics
When I identify, niggas simplify, you'll feel no sympath-i
My lyrics send you on a permanent excursion
I never would decide when your lifespan was submergin'
My style is urban, not suburban when I'm splurgin'
Gosh, these MC's, I wash more than detergent
I can split the Red Sea when deadly
Take heed, Illadelph style while I proceed


Bahamadia hits the melodies mellowly, brand newbie
Funk doobie, choosy with the tactics when I gets Raw
Like Dice, nice with the flavor, Do You Want More?!!!??!
Of the Organix, pure eargasmatic, from Distortion to Statics Automatic, systematic, I'm nasty at it
So, hand me the five microphones like you did Illmatic
One time 4 the mind
Rhyme be comin' from an Illadelph state of mind
The realest, not whole or Halftime, all the time
And I shall proceed, I'm movin' on, baby, I shall proceed
To remain on point like an infrared beam
Succeed in chasin' out the ultraviolet dreams
No Mas like Shorty, 'cause it's all about me


Black and handsome, holdin' MC's for ransom
Thoughts command some, is this a Phantom?
Crews I mangle, y'all know my anthem ain't the Star Spangled
I hit you from the most bizarre angle
Rectangular visions of papes my mind conceive
Motivatin' me to achieve, thus, I must proceed
When I ride the train, traumatized to maintain
When laid back, the tracks can relax the brain
I got to deal with everythin' on this intelligent plain
Servin' as a killer to the pain, I live a High Life like Miller
Me and the mics mechanized
Respect, recognize, loop mind beyond wise
Limitless, when I bless the mic with speed
Dialect never weak, y'all niggas know Tariq
From 7th, the Snyder Ave. got the flavor you need
For the ingredients, indeed, so to the lead, I shall proceed",https://genius.com/The-roots-proceed-3-lyrics

I'm something from his worst dreams
First we handling first things, I'm subsurface unseen

Shine like jewels that spark, swimmin' wit sharks
Never caught speakin' to NARC's, that's weak in the parks
I'm the type to sit back and analyze the prize
Grip it up and flee the scene wit a different disguise
Take a detour, I be all that I can be whore
Talkin' to this bitch life, had to make her my wife
Live twice, got seven more lives to live

Get off your horse and on your P's and beware
Of images you seein, did deceiving, you're scared

Sit and think about the way I wanna tally a sum

From over there in them bushes, I chilled and watched you
Dancin' all dolly as you pussy for them folly

The Lesson,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Well, it's the raw regees, thoroughbred from Philly
My name Black Thought, my girl's the Black Lilies
Some people try to front like, ""I ain't feelin' it really""
But that's silly, 'cuz how the fuck you can't feel me?
When I first felt it, I knew it had to be dealt wit'
A lot of ice-grillin' in the house got melted
Some tried to put up a fight, but they was helpless
You ain't tryin' to turn that loose, you too selfish
Gimme that, guess who bringin' the, 'get busy' back
Women say the sound of my voice, the aphrodisiac
E-me and when I'm in your town, come see me
The Real World for real, this ain't your MTV
The illest innervisions since Stevie on wax
My vocal like serve on forty-eight tracks
The fact of the matter is a matter of fact
That it's the Black Thought, controllin' like Ike Turner
You wanna get wise, you best to be a fast learner
Or just relax and peep how it's done
And boogie ya ass to what's about to come because
The lesson, now it's now, we close shop
We got it locked, it's over now
Aiyyo Dice's flows, hit idiots like crossbows
Knock 'em out the atlas, push 'em off the atlas
I'm laughin', lookin' down from off top the totem
Hop off my pedastal, grab my scrotum
Aiyyo y'all niggas ain't fuckin' it' this shit
Aiyyo y'all ain't fuckin' wit' the Roots crew
The bouncers were wild, yeah, 'cuz my family bouncin'
Soon as the name, Dice Raw is announced in
The arena, the grass is greener on the other side
I hit the stores, twenty-five thousand die
Now tell who the best in off the top in the world
I'll give you a hint, the same guy that's fuckin' your girl
I just didn't have parents, The Roots found me in the trash
But still, a nigga got a lot of class
Trick wit' my pinky-finger up off the glass
Keep talkin' shit homeboy, that's your ass
The lesson, now it's now, we close shop
We got it locked, it's over now
It's just the simple part of the game
I guess it's just the art of the scam
Check for your soul 'cuz it departed again
Millitant is atomic, you fall from the sky just like a comet
Move out till the bottom of my shoes out
How many tracks do you bout?
How many of these niggas you doubt?
How many of these ladies makin' you shout?
You on a mission so listen to this
Ask yourself, what condition is this?
I'm sick in the wrist, I rap on a satellite dish
You gotta like this
Askin' me about the way that I stroll
About the way I enfold, in scrambling mode
You're like that, don't bark, cat bite back
What up Blood? Is things still the same in the hood?
While I sit I gotta get dub and wish I could plug
They thoughts'll leave 'em stiff in the mud
You wannabe thug in section eight
Houses were hush up under the rug
The shit I spit is hummin' wit' slugs, get soaked in the suds

From the crown of notty hair that I wear to the funk feet
Wonder why the sisters dig the brother missin five teeth
Peace I gots to rock so pass the popcorn and shit
Quick to lick a shot to umm, Wheezy, and Cricket
Used to kick it in the house until I got myself evicted
Now The Crumbs is restricted to the popcorn, elected

Unforgettable what Stella Artois provides
True bittersweet place that it occupies

It's a moment in time, why waste or bury it?

By the five different scientific measurements of seeds
Then that'll work with, come get your thirst quenched

Well I'ma play by the rules and bud this surface
The only limit is the sky, no ceiling
One thing's for sure, it's I know feeling
What doesn't feel right's what I won't deal in
If it's airtight then it's worthy of a seal

Yo, yo, lost generation, fast paced nation
World population confront their frustration
The principles of true hip-hop have been forsaken
It's all contractual, and about money making
Pretend-to-be cats don't seem to know their limitations
Exact replication and false representation
You wanna be a man, then stand your own
To MC requires skills, I demand some shown
I let the frauds keep frontin'
And roam like a cellular phone far from home
Giving crowds what they wantin'
Offical hip-hop consumption, the 5th dumpin
Keepin' ya party jumpin with an original somethin
Yo, I dedicate this to the one dimension-al
No imagination, excuse for perpetration
My man came over and said
""Yo we thought we heard you""
Joke's on you
You heard a bitin' ass crew but uh

Never do, what they do when they do what they do

Verse Two: (Black Thought)
Thin is the line that run between love and hatred
The game is ill-natured, it's nothing sacred
Hey yo, it's funny when i see some rap niggas do to make it
A few would blow up or go as far as they can take it
My nine to five is just to hit ya get the party live
I'm Black Thought, used to rap for sport
Now the rhyme saying rent paying life support
I take it very seriously within this industry
It's various crews that try to touch me
But I come wit the beautiful things
And I bless the track plushly
Around the world the crowds love me from doing tours
Recipient of applause from all'a you and yours
Creator of original sounds to send to stores you take home
To absorb and sweat it out your pores
Now who can stop the music runnin' through these veins
Infinitely go against the grain
That's why my motto's to
Chorus
Verse Three: (Black Thought)
Livin the life of limos and lights
Airplanes and trains
Short days and long nights
Keyboards and mics
Bass chords and drum kicks
And my mental thick to hit my head like brick
As I embark on a mission welcoming to the dark
When I first spark the arts, when the listening start
Open your head wide and let the thought inside
My style fortified by all of philadel-phi
I've dealt more stealth than all the wicked weal-thy
Mentality undetectable by the naked eye
Then I get paid when the record is played
To put it short I want it Made like Ed, nuff said
Then after that, I'm puttin on my cousin Hamed
We let the ladies blend with the darkskin devil bred and discover
My level is that of no other

Malik be blitzed again- on the station with the discipline
Solicitin , sometimes illicit or explicit with it then
From the deep end where the hills are steep
Nobody cares to speak- a land where life is cheap
The street mentality mixed with the intellect
Niggas rebellious
Personality, hell where I dwell is well
My man caught a shot to the stomach
Bodies are found down in the cellars
Now who want it
Confronted by these dusty blunted- cats
Who act like they don't know that the fact is that they're being hunted
A process of elimination
Activate your mind with the stimulation
Enter your zone with penetration
I've seen more horror than Brahm Stroker
Strip your broad a play poker, then drink mocha
The sometimes socializer
You woke the wiser
The joke despiser
Dealin with the Roots vocalizer
I stampede your style
Up in your flesh from south Philly to west
I'll compile the bless
Chorus: 2X
Verse Two: Black Thought/ Malik B
Hey yo, I'm just a lyricist
The beat pimp
A chemist of the hemp
The ill Philly resident
That's far from hesitant
Never benevolent
Corrupt like a president
But poetically prevalent
Cooler than peppermint
Far from temporary son I'm very permanent
The lieutenant for niggas talkin bout represent
Hittin m.c.'s like an intoxicant
No doubt, its obviously evident I get bent
Sent to prevent
Monopoly is my intent
The means is what I invent
This mental murder pay the rent
Lyrically I'm the dominant ingredient
The swift extravagant
Smooth lubricant
Down with the M-the-Ill-itant
(ch-ch-ch...) That's the sound of the dynasty chant
We surround your camp
Assumin the war stance
And bring it from the chest
Now let's dance
M-ILL-ITANT
Feel the fifth Gorilla chant
Ya'll talk about bodies
But you would not kill a ant
My skill is amp
Would peel a nigga like a stamp
Caliber is of Excallibur now you be damp
When I operate a crop or copulate my game
I make a womb populate and 2-1-5th is this stock of hate
Peep the logistics
Slump your squad of misfits
They all get they wrists slit
Blast your ass if you insist it
Leave no trace so there's no trace for ballistics
In particular I've got that extracurricular
Turn your soul and body to statistics
Slip and they vicking ya
Squad in the stash who could be stcking ya
Harass your police commissionar
Don't like chicks with weaves talking bout ""I need conditioner""
That shits deader than niggas with a mortioner
A gymnanza(?!)
Up in your flesh like plasma
Take away your last breathe when you got asthma
Then meet Bad Lieu down at the plaza
Hip-hop extravaganza
Tell your man I slump him with a stanza
Now who's the boss not Tony Danza
P.O. took a piss test it came out not clean
My force not green but the force is obscene
Brody with my man Miz-Moose and Hakeem
My squad from deuce-four up the West Oak Lane
All the way to Takahwana and Frankfurt they know the name
It's like that... M-Ill-itant

Verse One: Bad Lieutenant/ M-Ill-itant
Master gettin cash in an orderly fashion
The attractive assassin, blastin the devil trespassin
Message to the fake nigga Flash-in
Slow-up Oc before you get dropped
And closed like a caption
Fractional kids don't know the time for action
Styles got the rhythm that of an Anglo-Saxon
Round of applause then avalanche a clappin
*PLOW* that's what happen, now what's your reaction
We heavyweight traction, pro-pornographin
Specialize in science and math and
Original black man
Vocal toe to toe impeccable splittin your backs son
Bustin thoughts that pierce your mental defense
Rippin your sacks and
Simple as addition and subtraction
Black Thought- the infinite relaxed one
Shorties say they love it with a passion
Bring the international charm
See a squad I harass
REACT
You best adapt when I sling this rap
Another chapter
Before when I have to trap ya
Map your whole path out
Go get your crowd so we can clap out
I drive down streets and take back route- positionin
When I'm in your system like glycerin
Fans listenin , from Michigan to Switzerland
Malik be blitzed again- on the station with the discipline
Solicitin , sometimes illicit or explicit with it then
From the deep end where the hills are steep
Nobody cares to speak- a land where life is cheap
The street mentality mixed with the intellect
Niggas rebellious
Personality, hell where I dwell is well
My man caught a shot to the stomach
Bodies are found down in the cellars

I can make you dance, I can make you shout
The scripts in the scroll turned the whole party out
Inject my lyrics in a sec with dialect
Why accept, because it's from the highest eye and depth
Rap extrordinaire share me never ever
See through because I be true, Malik's together
Intox your cells till your brain vein swells
*gunshot* claim terror when their never parellel
Once I have a hunch that there's MC's that front
I just crunched a whole bunch, in one big munch
I always stand firm, under any term
My actions never squirm cuz my tracks is perm
Have a tendency to defend this MC
My residency is simply in sensei
I makes it vivid, on different continents of earth I pivot
It seems extreme and exquisite but ask it is it
My style is like a cat from a seventies flick
Talkin jive as he strut with his afro pick
Or a predator, just before he stalks his pray
When I talk this way, I do dismay
See you're puzzled, now how I think you're trying to juggle
My mind is like a nine M double, now there's trouble
The Roots bring you styles and all types of creed
I sign off but I shall proceed

I shall, proceed, and continue, to rock the mic (4X)
Verse Two: Black Thought
Yo, we could get fly, we could get fly
We could get fly that's the anthem of my
Crew not to glorify still it's sorta high
Troubles of the world bring tears to my eye wonder why
My man, can't vaccinate, y'all know the fate
Similar to the way I'm a disease on tape
Within a world of hate many mics I *gunshot*
To escape Metropolis is such a violent state
I spill words over pages, styles over phrases
From the world's different stages for crowds of different ages
Though not a nova, you witness like Jehovah
Now *gunshot* beg for lyrical plague to pass them over
Right right n----z is like stick up kids
Doin bids you got caught, enter the Black Thought
I interface with bass when I communicate
Crowds I elevate, to a higher mindstate of
Rap thinking, see musically the Black thinking rhythm
Therefore, I give em what I'm giving, therefore
I give em what I'm giving that's the hardcore
The Roots'll keep it real for sure, and I shall proceed

All you see is flashing lights
A whole community ready to fight
One thousand MC's attack the mic
Nubians died and came back to life
Most of ya'll ant to a gaint, so try me
Don't you see the danger signs?
Niggas I've dared slimy
I give the chant and the youth fam a rain dance around me
I make it storm and thunder
When you from amongst us
Dig your boots, roll up the ? on your tomb
Going with shrooms, rhymes starin at the moon
I set the sun in early afternoons
Send out signals to get you back in tune
All light weight niggas will get vacuumed

I hit this mid-life crisis ten years before thirty
And stay in time, fuck fair ones, we fight dirty
We rally in the shadows of night and strike early
While your sight blurry, the blind fury
Fifth cal-vary
We to the rescue
Then rhyme battle like them crime battles depress too
Bullets in the wall of your chest too
And plus whoever you standin next to
The ambu-lance will come and collect you
I ripped you with the dart
Sect' true with the art
It's deeper than your classical Mozart
Your pop or R&B charts
Can never see Thought flows, is on some Philly shit
Murder one penmanship, the uninnocent
Cul-prit, MC's is insulted
And my affiliates/Aphillyates is high voltage

I walk through the smog with the fog light on in the morning
No ? without warning, I'm brain storming
Sketch the blueprint, lookin through tinted to mutant
Cause disorderly nusiance with pollutants
Advance on your stance, incite a cobra in October
Combine minds will take you over even when it's cold out
Whatever you say don't matter, disrespect and get splattered
The fact that you sunnin lotta niggas got me flattered
When they heard it was me, they all scattered
Notts Family love practice, we cock back for satisfaction
Pull on wear and bulletproofs is the fashion
On stings, we stackin
And fifty raid the crib, we stil clappin
We tear the club up from state to state
Bouncin back to the bullet state, holdin the eight
Like Onyx, we Shut Em Down
Wack crews, we lay em down
We all organizing, while you idolizing
And when the guns bust, it's the bullets that you can't trust
Kiss the barrel on your knees before I ripped you up
Aphillyation and The Roots, c'mon give it up
Wit these lyrics that'll hit you from your nuts up
Quest the barber, last illest rhyme author
If I can't catch you, best believe my ill squad'll off ya
Wit the sparker, seven shot departure
Five of those caught ya
Sneak attack competition I taught ya
Any conflict I come equipped
Swift with the riot spit
Makin cats backflip from my vocals in this rap shit
Where fake rappers get capped shit
Found in the dumpster with they cap's split
Double check, you shoulda packed it
Empty clips ain't never clapped shit
Retaliation, you lacked it
Now your back's against the wall, plastered
Ditto, this is that shit that got six fillin our vest
?? fillin our chest, cuz when hell's lit, we the best
You ever heard in this shit, we spit degrees
That'll freeze, melt, and bring life to the shit
Yo like atoms we split, eye to eye we sit
Declare war within, defeatin war with men
Now who can beat us
When you was watered
Our mens tore it down, start settin up shop
It's building blocks, now the cops can't stop what we got
It's too HOT
Locals hassle niggas till they drop
Get caught up in spots and what not

Can't hit us with beams or Glocks

You get to know me, you poke me slowly, when caught puzzin'
Some niggas thought they was, when of course they wasn't
Punked em wit' a dozen of pellets all in they skelet
Transform, from the norm, start to brainstorm
Yeah Malik B from The Roots, he ain't gone
I took the wrong exit, the sign said Langhorne
I'm trapped up in about five worlds with live pearls
Shouts to Armour Akquan whose name is Jalil
The moat is deep water so let your hand expand it
Demanding, takin' you back like Knots Landing
I'm Ralph Kramden, we out, you'll see in Hampton
Yo what the what the what the, what the what the what the
Pivot on this concrete earth until I rot

You'll get blown out the sky once shit get talkative
A-D devise rise, I fathered it
So when you see me on the street, don't bother kid
Just be on your merry way, or you might get slit
Ask around, wondering what Dice Raw did
Lay you on floors like ya getting carpeted
You need a special kind of mic for retarded kids
Me against you's like Kane verse the Partridges
You wanna battle, change your name to The Forfeiters

I never dissed her, painted my picture to hit

Like, ""Listen man, I'm Queen Amina, Amina's not no freak and

Then sayin I'm more sewer than Das EFX, and closed-minded

Could touch and make you say that I'm such a man

To stop givin' me the silent.. treatment baby
Can't you see what you mean to me?
I wanna love you constantly, but you keep neglecting me
And treating me silently
Girl you know that you need
To stop givin' me the silent.. treatment baby
Can't you see what you mean to me?
I wanna love you constantly, but you keep neglecting me
And treating me silently
Yo, I had a Queen named Amina, height 5'7""
Caramel-complected, body like heaven
Met her through the sister of my man Big Vince
Like some shit from out the flicks we been in love ever since
She called me her chocolate brotha, I call her my sugar sista
Knew Shorty could work it since before I ever kissed her
I never dissed her, painted my picture to hit
But because sex she wasn't with, she started flippin an' shit
Like, ""Listen man, I'm Queen Amina, Amina's not no freak and
That game is weak and keep tryin to hit I could quit speakin
Tariq in fact, you bein BlackThought don't get ya closer
I dig ya but won't bone ya because I'm so-called supposed ta
Most o' them would, but that couldn't be me, that's not my flava
Go home and think about that, maybe later on I'll page ya...""
I contemplated, and then concluded she was bluffin
Steady pursuin screwin, gettin nothin but the silent treatment
Girl you know that you need
To stop givin' me the silent.. treatment baby
Can't you see what you mean to me?
I wanna love you constantly, but you keep neglecting me
And treating me silently
Bay-bee
Crazy frustration, about my lovin situation
When patience was a virtue, but I wasn't used to waitin
I want some Marvin Gaye healin, feelin is real inside
I slip and slide, my ride'll keep you occupied, I'd..
Love to get wit it like that, but my baby's kitty cat's capped
And locked, Love Boat is docked at the shore
And what for? Later for groupies on tour
Why won't my sugar call me no more?
I mean, my Queen gets upset, rejectin and sexually neglect
Then sayin I'm more sewer than Das EFX, and closed-minded
It's like I'm blinded by the skinnin
I'm into women; because of that, this one's into communication
Temptation played the vandal, freakin my brain, my mind
Rippin the handle on physically scandalous acts
Yo! She knew what I wanted, but she fronted
... bust it
Girl you know that you need
To stop givin' me the silent.. treatment baby
Can't you see what you mean to me?
I wanna love you constantly, but you keep neglecting me
And treating me silently
Well umm
Movin right along with the song, plus the strong
Feelings on my mind, desire to intertwine
Combine and blend, baby bust a message that I send
Ain't no need to pretend, cause shit is real til the end
I provide a place to hide from crime, hard times
And livin trife, while I open ya mind, you're in my life
Like love, it ain't no way no one can rise above what's real
That's why I'm feelin like you're makin me bugged
I puff an El on fifty deuce while I walk in the rain
Heart feelin killa pain while I hop the train
Dial her number to the rest, and ain't no messages left
Regardless, my chest thumps from stress, yo it's a mess
I don't know what I got to do to make you understand
I'm for real and that's no question, no frontin or no guessin
Undressin, carressin, in the span, that I contain in my hand
Could touch and make you say that I'm such a man
And call my name, so let me set your body aflame
I'll never treat you like a dame or run game
Now who's to blame?
I know you're not a hoe for niggas with a lot of dough
But I just wanted you to know
Girl you know that you need
To stop givin' me the silent.. treatment baby
Can't you see what you mean to me?
I wanna love you constantly, but you keep neglecting me
And treating me silently
Silently, silently
Girl you know that you need
To stop givin' me the silent.. treatment baby
Can't you see what you mean to me?

Mother, Imagine: John Lennon 75th Birthday Concert,2019.0,"Mother, you had me but I never had you
I wanted you, you didn't want me
So I, I just gotta tell you
Goodbye, goodbye
Father, you left me but I never left you
I needed you, you didn't need me
So I, I just gotta tell you
Goodbye, goodbye
Children, don't you do what I have done
I couldn't walk and I tried to run
So I, I just gotta tell you
Goodbye, goodbye
Mama don't go, daddy come home
Mama don't go, daddy come home
Mama don't go, daddy come home
Mama don't go, daddy come home
Mama don't go, daddy come home
