Nigga,24 Shots,2003,"I love niggas! I love niggas!
'Cause niggas are me!
And I should only love that which is me
I love to see niggas go through changes (Whoooo!!)
I love to see niggas shoot through shit (Did it again)
And to all niggas that do it, I love

To all my Brooklyn (Niggas!)
To all my Uptown (You niggas understand?!)
To all my Bronx (It's war nigga)
To all my Queensbridge (I'll blow you away)

Back up, chump, you know Biggie Smalls grips it quick
And kicks it quick, you know how black niggas get
With the hoods fatigues with the boots with trees
Smokin weed, flippin ki's, makin' crazy G's
Hittin' buckshots at niggas that open spots
On the avenue, take my loot, and I'm baggin' you
Pimpin hoes that drive Volvo's and Rodeos
Flash the Roll, make her wet, in her pantyhose
Damn, a nigga style is unorthodox
Grip the Glock, when I walk down the crowded blocks
Just in case a nigga wanna act out
I just black out, and blow they motherfuckin' back out
That's a real nigga for ya

We the realest, nigga
50 Cent and B.I.G., my nigga
Don't try to act like you don't feel a nigga
Biggie your nigga, 50 your nigga
Squeeze the trigga, leave a nigga for sure
We the realest, nigga
50 Cent and B.I.G., my nigga
Don't try to act like you don't feel a nigga
Biggie your nigga, 50 your nigga
Squeeze the trigga, leave a nigga for sure

When we smoke spliffs, we pack four-fifths
Just in case dread wanna riff
He get a free lift to the cemetary, rough very
Not your ordinary, we watch you get buried
That's a real nigga for ya
Get mad do a quarter flip the script, and rip your lawyer
Spit at the D.A. cause fuck what she say
She don't give a fuck about your ass anyway
Up North found first stop for the town
Of fist-skill, where the hand skills are real ill
You'll be a super Hoover doo-doo stain remover
Ha hahhh, yo G, pass the budda

We the realest, nigga
50 Cent and B.I.G., my nigga
Don't try to act like you don't feel a nigga
Biggie your nigga, 50 your nigga
Squeeze the trigga, leave a nigga for sure
We the realest, nigga
50 Cent and B.I.G., my nigga
Don't try to act like you don't feel a nigga
Biggie your nigga, 50 your nigga
Squeeze the trigga, leave a nigga for sure

When I was young my M.O. was to go hand in hand
And even my P.O. she called me the Ginger Bread Man
I cut ya new case, and tell her ass ""catch me if you can""
Don't let your people you up with octane, I'm not playing
Get gassed up to get blast up
Real B.I.G. style watch the kid break it down
Check it, thou shalt not fuck wit North Seed Papa
50 Cent, I'll break yo punk ass off propa'
There's no place like home, New York - New York
I run this city, I don't dance around like Diddy
Niggas is giddy, till they act smack silly
Or spray wit the Mack Milly, they don't want drama really
Pussy niggas get hard lip-syncing my lyrics like Milly Vanilly
In the hood they feel me, {*gun cocked*} hah, I'm on fire
Niggas out in Philly they feel me, they bump my shit
Every bootlegger you know, bump my shit, bitch!

We the realest, nigga
50 Cent and B.I.G., my nigga
Don't try to act like you don't feel a nigga
Biggie your nigga, 50 your nigga
Squeeze the trigga, leave a nigga for sure
We the realest, nigga
50 Cent and B.I.G., my nigga
Don't try to act like you don't feel a nigga
Biggie your nigga, 50 your nigga
Squeeze the trigga, leave a nigga for sure

I got 50 Cent, I got G-Unit
D-Twizzy's in this bitch with Obie Trice (whoo!)
So watch what you say (uh-uh) before you call our name
If you say one more thing, it won't be nice

Uh, here we go, I shoulda known
I was bound to get pulled into some bullshit sooner or later
You little haters are too jealous of us to love us
You hate it, G-Unit made it
And Obie's comin', D-Twizzy's comin', you sick to your stomach
Fifty percent is 50-Cent, the other fifty percent is whose color skin it is
Well if you're even considering takin' our label down
You better find our building and fly a fucking plane into it
But I ain't tryin' to get too intricate into it
I'm just tryin' to give you a little hint for your own benefit
'Cause then it's gonna get to the point where it escalates
Into some other shit, then I'ma flip
Then I'ma get to stompin' in my Err Force One's
Won't be able to tell if it's two purrs or it's one
It's gonna feel like there's so many feet kickin' you
You think that Nike just made these into cleat tennis shoes
I don't know what it is or what it could be
But I get a woody when these pussy's try to push me
Thinkin' they gon' put me in the position to pickle me
Y'all tickle me pink, I think I'd just rather have P!nk tickle me
Hickory-dickory-dock, tickety-tock-tickety
A little bit of the diggity-doc-diggity
Mixed with a little bit of the jigga-jig-jigga
With a small pinch of Biggie
Look at me, I'm just the bomb-diggity

We the realest label
Don't try to act like you don't feel our label
'Cause we gon' fuck around and kill your label
Obie, D-Twizzy, G-Unit, 50, Shady Records
We the label for sure
We the realest label
Don't try to act like you don't feel our label
We gon' fuck around and steal your people
Obie, D-Twizzy, G-Unit, 50
We gonna kill your fuckin' label for sure

Shady in the place to be, see
And I got what it takes to rock the mic right
Still watch what you say to me punk
'Cause I'm off probation in less than six months

Haha, whoo!
Shady Records
Still Aftermath
And don't think we don't hear you motherfuckers talking
'Cause we do
We see y'all
But we just gonna sit back for a minute
And watch what the fuck yall do",https://genius.com/The-notorious-big-and-50-cent-nigga-lyrics

Yeah

The weak or the strong
Who got it going on?
You're dead wrong
The weak or the strong
Who got it going on?
You're dead wrong

Relax and take notes while I take tokes of the marijuana smoke
Throw you in a choke—gunsmoke, gunsmoke
Biggie Smalls for mayor, the rap slayer
The hooker layer, motherfucker, say your prayers!
""Hail Mary, full of grace..."" smack the bitch in the face
Take her Gucci bag and the North Face off her back
Jab her if she act funny with the money
Oh, you got me mistaken, honey
I don't wanna rape ya, I just want the paper
The Visa, capisce-ah? I'm out like The Vapors
Who's the one you call Mr. Macho?
The head honcho, swift fists like Cu-macho
I got so much styles I should be down with the Stylistics
""Make up to break up,"" niggas need to wake up
Smell the Indonesia, beat you to a seizure
Then fuck your moms, hit the skins to amnesia
She don't remember shit, just the two hits
Her hittin' the floor and me hittin' the clit
Sucking on the tits, had the hooker beggin' for the dick
And your moms ain't ugly, love, my dick got rock quick
I guess I was a combination of House of Pain and Bobby Brown
I was Humpin' Around and Jumpin' Around
Jacked her, then, I asked her, ""Who's her man?"" She said, ""B-I-G,""
Then I bust in her E-Y-E

Yo Big, you're dead wrong

When I get dusted I like to spread the blood like mustard
Trust it, my hardcore rain leaves you rusted
Move over, Lucifer, I'm more ruthless, uh
Leave you toothless, you'll kibitz, I'll flip it
Tears don't affect me, I hit 'em with the TEC, G's
Disrespect me, my potency is deadly
I'm shooting babies; no ifs, ands or maybes
Hit mummy in the tummy if the hooker plays a dummy
Slit the wrist of little sis after she sucked the dick
I stabbed her brother with the ice pick
Because he wanted me to fuck him from the back
But Smalls don't get down like that
Found your father hiding in a room, fucked him with the broom
Slit him down the back and threw salt in the wound
Who you think you're dealing with?
Anybody step into my path is fucking feeling it
Hardcore, I got it sucked like a pussy
Stab you 'til you're gushy, so please don't push me
I'm using rubbers so they won't trace the semen
The black demon got the little hookers screaming (Woo!)
Because you know I love it young, fresh and green
With no hair in between, know what I mean?

The weak or the strong, who got it going on? (You're dead wrong)
You're dead wrong Yo Big, you're dead wrong
The weak or the strong, who got it going on?
(This 2000, Bad Boy forever, baby) You're dead wrong
The weak or the strong, who got it going on? (Who got it going on?)
You're dead wrong Yo Big, you're dead wrong
The weak or the strong who got it going on?
(Ladies and gentlemen...) You're dead wrong

There's several different levels to Devil worshiping
Horses' heads, human sacrifices, cannibalism, candles and exorcism
Animals, having sex with 'em, camels, mammals and rabbits
But I don't get into that, I kicked the habit
I just beat you to death with weapons that eat through the flesh
And I never eat you unless the fucking meat looks fresh
I got a lion in my pocket, I'm lyin', I got a 9 in my pocket
And baby, I'm just dyin' to cock him
He's ready for war, I'm ready for war
I got machetes and swords for any faggot that said he was raw
My Uzi's heavy as yours, yeah you met me before
I just didn't have as large an arsenal of weapons before
Marshall will step in the door, I'll lay your head on the floor
With your body spread on the bedspread, red on the wall
Red on the ceiling, red on the floor, get a new whore
Met on the second, wed on the third, then she's dead on the fourth
I'm dead wrong!

The weak or the strong
Who got it going on? (You're dead wrong)

Come On,Born Again,1999,"Motherfucka was amped (Uh huh)

Let's go deep into the phrase, 
feel the sun rays
Off the forehead, everything is real
Biggie put me on this joint, so I'ma be the big wheel
Watch it spin, hey dad, placed your bet on seven
Peace to 106, 108, 110 and 111th
Hey Biggie, I understand you're from Brooklyn
With .22s in your shoes, yo, keep this joint cooking

Well, why not blow up the spot with Sadat?
Release the brainstorm to make your motherfucking brain warm
A strange form, something kind of lyrical
Biggie the bastard, Sadat's kind of spiritual
Well, 
in God we trust
, guns I bust
Got that disgusting, sewer-style dumping
And, uh, do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that I bring?
Make an MC wanna sing for a living
Take the beatdown we fucking giving
C'mon, motherfucker!

Come on, motherfuckers, come on

What? Niggas want drama, putting work on my block
When I told y'all last week that shit was too hot
Selling deuces and treys cuts my dimes
Somebody don't get paid, somebody's block get sprayed
Reaction is delayed as ya run down the block
Caught one in your chest, your breath come in spurts
Hey yo, Biggie, tell these niggas I'ma hit 'em where it hurts
The Big City, it don't spare no bodies
Call me papi chulo, to all the Spanish mamis
I'm about ten blunts down, drank three or four stouts
Seen five fat asses
, passed this bitch with glasses
Hey, your money, that's your stock, yo bitch, pass the Glock
I'ma tell them, ""It can happen, don't play me with that rap shit""
Life is real, so Biggie take the steel

Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on

I got seven Mac-11's, about eight .38's
Nine 9's, ten Mac-10's the shits never end
You can't touch my riches
Even if you had MC Hammer and them 357 bitches
Biggie Smalls, the millionaire, the mansion, the yacht
The two weed spots, the two hot Glocks
Huh, that's how I got the weed spot
I shot dread in the head, took the bread and the lamb spread
Lil' Gotti got the shotty to your body
So don't resist or you might miss Christmas
I tote guns
, 
I make number runs
I give MCs the runs dripping
When I throw my clip in the AK, I slay from far away
Everybody hit the D-E-C-K
My slow flows remarkable, 
peace to Matteo
Now we smoke weed like Tony Montana sniff the yayo
That's crazy blunts, mad L's
My voice excels from the avenue to jail cells
Oh my God I'm dropping shit like a pigeon
I hope you're listening, smacking babies at they christening
So you better grab your pistol
'Cause if you sit still, I'm gonna make your fucking shit spill
And I'm talking 'bout buckets, why did I have to do it?
Sadat said fuck it, you got a gun, nigga bust it
'Cause I got mo' shots to pop ya
Big Poppa, breaking you off something proper
Signing off is the hardcore rap singer
AKA crack slinger, bring it any time nigga

Come on, motherfuckers, come on

Rap Phenomenon,Born Again,1999,"""Well it's the Funk Docta Spock..""
""Meth-Tical..""
""Biggie.. Biggie.."" (mmmhmmmmmm)

Uhh.. uhh.. uhh.. (yo c'mon Big) uhh..
Fuck that, I preach it, my nine reaches
The prestigious, cats that speak this, Willie shit
Flooded pieces, my hand releases, snatches
Smack ya cabbage, half-ass rappers, shouldn't have it
So I grab it, never run, the outcome
Is usually, a beatdown brutally, fuck who you be
Or where you're from, West or East Coast, squeeze toast
Leave most in the blood they layin in, what, what?
The rings and things you sing about, bring 'em out
It's hard to yell when the barrel's in your mouth
It's more than I expected, I thought your jewels was rented
But they wasn't, so run it, cousin
I could chill, the heat doesn't
Ran up in your shell about a dozen, you never see bank like Frank White
Your hand clutchin, your chest-plate contemplate
You 'bout to die, nigga wait, keep yo' hands high

Yo.. yo yo
I don't brown nose out of town hoes
I'm up around fo' with the crowbar to the five point oh
I get bagged, I'm John Doe, suspect
You ass like prime roastin, Calvin Klein clothes
Explode the pyros when Doc guest appear
I'm out there, I bought it with George Jetson here
Your time is near, so get your body dropped off
I stopped trusting niggas since Gotti got caught
It's Bricks, keep your wrist covered, I'm piss colored
By the waist got a gun as dark as Kris brother
I.C.U., my sheisty crew, like ice me too
I break your legs, leave your eyes slightly blue
The Doc was born with a grenade palm
I'm concurrent in your hood like a, teenage mom
Yo Biggie (what? what?) She havin my bay-bayy
If I pull out the A.K., keep your hands high

""This rule is so underrated.."" -
""Actin as if it can't happen, you're frontin"" -
""Ain't no other kings in this rap thing.."" -

Uhh, uhh
I got a new mouth to feed, I'm due South with keys
Y'all pick seeds out y'all weed, I watch cowards bleed
Motherfucker please, it's my block with my rocks
Fuck that hip-hop, them one-two's, and you don't stops
Me and my nigga Lance, took Kim and Cease advance
Bought ten bricks, four pounds of weed plants
From Branson, now we lampin, twelve room mansion
Bitches get naked off ""Get Money"", ""Player's Anthem""
Don't forget, ""One More Chance"" and my other hits, other shit
Niggas spit be counterfeit, robbery come naturally
In and out like fuckin rapidly, pass the gat to me
Make his chest rest, where his back should be, talkin' blasphemy
Blastin me, your family, rest in coffins often
Frank Wizzah, far from soft or fragilla
Play hard like Reggie Miller, rapper, slash dope dealer
Slash guerilla, slash illest turned iller

Now now
Don't approach me with that rah rah shit, you out of pocket
I take these adolescents back to Spofford
Mentally, my energy, is like a figure eight, on it's side, that's infinity
Too many sick niggas, nickel nines bring the remedy
When you play the field, what's the penalty?
Unnecessary roughness, career endin' injuries for suckers
Stuck on stupid, shoot 'em with a dart like Cupid
Until they got love for my music
Star Wars, I'm Han Solo, with three egos
And three charges, I got to ""See-three-P.O.'s""
This is whoop-yo'-ass-day, the sequel
High bar flow-er with no equal
Niggas swingin' swords in the WAR, that's my people
Sho' nuff, before I roll up, this is a hold up
Hands high, reach for the sky
I rep S.I., the unpretty, word to Left Eye
New York Shitty, put they weight on it
And who better for the job than Biggie?
The Notorious, Jeee-zus, ""Unbelievable"" rhyme that reaches
And touch individual, small frame buck and change
MC, What's-Your-Name, tuck your chain
All about the fortune, fuck the fame, labels still extortin'
Kick me when I'm down, but I'm up again, scorchin'
Hot — forcin' my way up in the door
To kill the bullshit like a matador
Keep your hands high (what?)",https://genius.com/The-notorious-big-rap-phenomenon-lyrics

Since my man died, we don't hang out
We blow brains out, we tear the club up pullin' things out
Mafia World, all my niggas max out
We Bad Boys, why ya'll niggas cracked out
Coward niggas, most are burried down south
Far from gangstas, really hush puppies
Niggas bearly speak when we discuss money
Niggas stay yappin when there's always somethin' funny
The realest niggas never took nuthin from me
Rock ice, stay jig, fuck with niggas that got drunk, and hate kids
Got niggas on state bids, that hate movies like Rosewood and Matrix
Ayo, Biggie taught me well
Biggie told me how to flip bricks like cartwheel

To all my thugs who puffed him
To all my girls who hugged him
You love him, yell his name (Biggie)
I'd rather die on my feet, than live on my knees
Nigga please, I cock and squeeze for (Biggie) Mafia

Face down, you know the routine, the cream
Earrings, you know the drama Biggie bring

For B.I.G., I learn to grip aim and cock it
Once I got it, I lock it
Banger, big city boy with deep pockets
See me speak, that paper better be the topic
I like my ice frozen like the Antartic
I'm quick to finish it, your good to start it
And with the flashy colors on, you just a target, Waitin for a hard hit
I like marine blue, marine green, roll with a mean team
Meshed out, fresh out, and stay greams
We big boys, we do big things, born in this county of kings
I ain't got shit, I spread things, take things
Fuck whenever my mood swings, from the summer for the winter to the spring
My nigga ill's holdin it down for the beam
Like BIG said, we do the real things, we still bubble and steal chains
Still tustle, still struggle, we feel pain
Still ride, still die for BIG's name

Not cause of what he said, 'cause of what he did
When I hear that pop quiz, that's the way I was raised
And that's the way it is for (Biggie)
We roll like the Panthers, show our guns on camera
Do jokes with police scanners, niggas mediocre, full of dirt like hampers
I roll with a bunch of niggas that wear bandanas and rep
We kept it thurough, from the heart ripped the barrel
B.K. style, see B.I.G. howl, now
Lets see who, wanna go against Mafia world
Niggas nuthin' but squirrels, they know we rep
Niggas tryin to get a nut, hit in the head or below the gut
Wood style roll'em up, get plucked, nigga what?!
Go back to spend a ton, and know cats wit gold tooths
Know my gat and bust for my nigga (Biggie)

Fuck em.. yeah, uhh..
With my hands gripped, praise the Lord shit
Fuck her, never knew her
Screw her.. (dump her body, dump her body) sewer
Our father.. uh-huh..

What you expected from his next of kin
I'm loco bro, but ain't no Mexican
I got nines in the bedroom, Glocks in the kitchen
A shotty by the shower if you wanna shoot me while I'm shittin
Uhh, the lesson from the Smith and Wessun is depressin
Niggas keep stressin, the same motherfuckin question
How many shots does it take to make my heart stop
And my body start to shake? If I should die before I wake

With my hands gripped, praise the Lord shit
Our Father, if I should die before I wake
With my hands gripped, praise the Lord shit
Our Father, if I should die before I wake

Fluck that, snap a nigga shit, smash him with the 5th, watch his body lift
Shut his hottie's lips, bitch screamin, hit her body quick
Got me like the trifest not knowin how my life is
My life is, rap sheet long as the Turnpike
The sheistest, hey fella, who bidded with the lifers
Did it with the Glocks, spit it with your pops, you was in diapers
Loved me when you came to Rikers
Hated me all in the free cypher, mad you can't be like us
Some murderers who turn bikers, see Biggie Smalls
Recruited these snipers, alumni do it just like us
Some pied pipers, squeezin life out y'all
It's all out war, be all wild as all outdoor
If a coward got beef, y'all be checkin his palm
Paralyzin, my niggas thorough kid, how bout yours?
Real quick to screw a nigga then, pop out four
Clean the wipers, hit the party up and, hop out yours
Bitch nigga, whoah

With my hands gripped, praise the Lord shit
Our Father, if I should die before I wake
With my hands gripped, praise the Lord shit
Our Father, if I should die before I wake

Yo, when you fuckin with Mac, you fuckin with the best
I'm still going to war with them dusty Tecs
Man you know how I handle my shit, S.K. can on my shit
Jump out of vans like Hannibal Smith
Man I spit a thousand rounds, your squad don't need it
Shredders in a riot pump leave you quadriplegic
When I squeeze don't breathe keep it lined and even
So when niggas get hit, they be cryin screamin
Lyin bleedin from that iron steamin
And I ain't tryin to hear that bullshit, I ain't mean it
Niggas start bitchin, when that pistol in they face
Or I sick two pits to come and get you in your place
If I catch you in my shit, I'm wakin my bitch
Hear take this shit, crackin the brick, facin that shit
Takin two sniffs, grabbing my shit
Best believe if I get hit, y'all niggas takin some shit
Picture niggas takin my shit

With my hands gripped, praise the Lord shit
Our Father, if I should die before I wake
With my hands gripped, praise the Lord shit
Our Father, if I should die before I wake

Niggas never thought they'd see Cube and Biggie
In the year 2000 all drunk and pissy
Off whiskey, you can miss me acting gay
He's the King of New York, I'm the King of L.A
Doin it the O.G. way, it's sorta like
The Brooklyn Way, it's just the crook in me
So this is dedicated to the memory of
The Notorious One, the glorious one
And if you go for your gun, I got to go for mine
Cock my nine and seperate your head from your spine
So, ""Grab yo' dicks if you love Hip-Hop"" and
Fuck you niggas that shot Big Pop'
The conspiracy of this nation for assassination
Of the young black male in this black Hell
And I can tell, no matter the weather
That you and 2Pac got your shit together
California Love

With my hands gripped, praise the Lord shit
Our Father, if I should die before I wake
With my hands gripped, praise the Lord shit

Would You Die for Me,Born Again,1999,"Venue after venue, I've been through
Coming to the telly, so I can bend you
Send you to the store, condoms and more
Jealous females, call you sluts and whores
Could it be my hardcore metaphor
Make sweat pour on the bedroom floor
Open up the Lex door
Jump on in, I'm kind of tired
I'm a roll blunts while you spin
You got your license, right? Alright, no swerving
Hair blonde out, Madonna style like a virgin
Splurging, Dom P., Ro-se
Much foreplay, that's my forte
Niggas see the ring, baguettes to death
She looking for a man, honey he just left
Violate me, he get beat to death
Goodfellas squeeze every shell they got left
Grand Marnier increase the don strength
Two four-fifths within my arms length
With a calm breath I say we gots to float
Throw Little Cease the keys to the boat
Tongue all down her throat, you know the routine
Got my dick large like Bruce Springsteen
And you mean too, eyes greenish blue
Got the Coogi sweater with the bubble Fubu
Beautiful, that's how the night goes
Get out them tight clothes
Get in some night clothes
I invite those girls that smoke lye
Keep it real with you
You keep it real with I
We be tight like frog's ass
Have you screaming ""Biggie, Biggie give me one more chance""

Would you ride with me? (Yeah)
Would you lie for me? (That's right)
Would you get high with me? (For sure)
Would you die for me? (No doubt)

Would you get high with me? (For sure)
Would you die for me? (No doubt)

These hoes don't treat you like I treat you
Like my contacts, I can see right through
Don't they know me and you is stuck like glue?
Queen Bitch means number one and two
Wifey, ya'll ain't got to like me
Go head and act dumb, you'll just catch a hot one
Y'all know where I'm from
Bucktown, lay your ass down
You don't wanna play around (with me)
Probably just mad because Frank chose me
A fly cu-tie, you just a grou-pie
Girls call my telephone just to hang up
While me and you is in the crib, laying up
Oh he ain't tell you that we live together
And that we gonna have a kid together
Whatever, me intimidated, never
Anything you give to him, he give it right to Kim
Anyway, I fuck better than you
Give head better than you, pussy get wetter than you
If I fuck another nigga, don't mean nothing
B.I.G. is in my heart from the start
Whether broke or rich, I'm a stay his bitch
Chicks who used to be around, where they at now?
(See I don't care bout them other broads)
B.I.G. kept it real with me, and that's that

Would you lie for me? (That's right)
Would you get high with me? (For sure)

Hope You Niggas Sleep,Born Again,1999,"Check the pain I inflict, like a convict, the Fulton digger
Jump in the Acura Vigor, after I stick ya
Rip ya like a razor, straight up Henny with no chaser
Watch me erase ya, misplace ya
Put you in the back with the derelicts
Yeah, I pop plenty shit
Chump, I'm making hits
No time for the crack rock and shit
Took it to another level
Now I'm getting crazy papes, getting paid from the devils
Another amateur trying to damage the pedigree
Of the B-I-G-G-I-E, you know it's me
Hoes, I thought you know I'm smooth as a baby's ass
Smooth as Teeddy Pendegrass, smoke the grass, get in your ass
The Brooklyn-born Teflon Don, wrecking shop
Getting props, proving nobody drops
Words as potent as the blunt smoking Bed-Stuy bandit
And niggas just can't understand it
I bust a cap for the brothers in Nap Nap, Comstock, and Clinton
You know my shit is hitting
Yeah, ya'll, a fly nigga, Biggie Smalls
Kicking flavor, make a nigga wanna dig up in their drawers
For the burner, catch a body
I got styles like karate
Jujitsu, when I hit you then I split you
Like a cantaloupe
Hope you got a rope to hang yourself
I rob for self; from Brooklyn, where else?
Fat like a Lexus coupe, I ripped your troop
Not even Lois Lane could get the scoop
What you think, I'm stupid?
My crew is mad deep
I hope you niggas sleep

I throw a bomb through your window
Burn you up and your ho
I catch your mama going to therapy and cut her throat
Your little sister walking home from school
I abduct her, then I fuck her
I hit your park close up with the Louisville Slugger
B.G.-zy is the hustler, ignorant motherfucker
I was taught how to bust heads by the best head-busters
Cluckers, you know I got 'em, two for one, my nigga
I'm on V.L. if you want me, get some my nigga, come on

Thugging is my thing; if I'm beefing, I'm banging
Slanging, it's in my nature, gotta be about my paper
Haters, I don't like 'em; bitches, I don't trust 'em
Niggas, I can't stand 'em, I creep down and pluck 'em
Strap stay in my hand, I gotta protect mine
Niggas trying to pull it off, ""pop,"" goes the nine
That's how it got to be in these uptown streets
And a nigga like me, I play the game for keeps

I remember when niggas slang heroin up in balloons
I paid attention to everything, from killings to cartoons
Got a picture of Malcolm X on the wall in my room, bitch
Want some old nigga? Fuck with me, I'mma do 'em, shit
Nigga give me dope, I accept it, but don't respect him
Put my foot in their rectum right after I dome checked 'em
I be popping D, smoking weed, and full of that Hennesey
Fresh off the streets on my way to the penitentiary
Everybody whisper in ears when they gonna mention me
I been out doing it for years--since elementary
Real good relationship with guns and drugs
Because my whole neighborhood consists of crook and thugs
Everything is my own shit cause I don't fuck with scrubs
I don't need you harassing me when I'm up in the club
Trying to hustle a nigga, asking me for a dub
Quarter, ki's, and halfs is what I sling, cause that's what I love

I know you bitches know that I ain't to be played with
Dont have no picks and chooses who get they head split
They die quick, fucking with Turk, wodie get whacked
Spend a bin with Kevin and Randy leave ya flat on you back
And trust that, ain't bout to let no nigga steal me
Fuck that, I bust back with a .223
Big and full of that raw with no cut and be ready to creep
Innocent people move cause somebody fixing to get split

Na, Na, it's iceberg shorty, Lordy have mercy
Come from under my shirts and flip'em and reverse'em
I'm coming so alert them
(Ur, Ur) fore I hurt them, desert eagle bursting
You haven't seen the worst and
I'm right near you and my gun blast quick, dog
Could kill you so run, dash, get gone
Wodies movin slow around this time they got bricks dog
I ain't got bricks dog, nigga break it off, what

The raw rapper, spine snapper
With the little hookers on my lap-ah
You know the flavor Mack-ah
A shy nigga but I ain't your fuckin comforter
And if I ever fall in love I bet I'm fuckin her
Ask the hooker, if I didn't jook her
If she tried to front, then I drop the Chuckii Booker on her:
""Why you wanna...play your games on me""
Bitch, you crazy?
Commitments, I'm Swayze, no time for the ill shit
Rest with the niggas on that real bloodspill shit

Stretchin motherfuckers like Mr. Fantastic

Live on your station, the radiation'll melt ya
Cool - I guess your momma raised a fool
You didn't wanna blaze your tool shoulda stayed in school
Rap terror, shots through your new era
Get it together, y'all niggas shoulda knew better
I'm on point like acupuncture
I might, track and hunt ya, smack and punch ya
Left side, right side, witcha ho I might slide
Runnin' wit' this big guy, y'all niggas is pint-size
Don't make a nigga have to show you the pound
And show you the sound, that'll put you low in the ground
Just let me get down

Let me get down, let me get down, let me get down, let me get down

I be like: ""Whaaaat?"" Let me clear my throat
Break the smoke, Missy gotta hit some high notes
Heyy! Yo, from coast to coast I burn like toast
So dope that I floats through snow, nig-guh
Oh, you don't wanna battle me
The agony be like: ""Somebody help me, please!""
Feel my pressure, never could a bitch flow better
In any weather, I biddy-bang-bang in ya, nigga
Ah-huh, I used to be the chick to lick the lollipop
Now I pop through your body parts
Blaow, blaow! You like the way I interact
Proceed to smack, any MC that's wack
Ah-huh, microphone check one two
I do ya tool like them freaks run through your crew
Give it to me, ohh, send it to me, ohh

Ms Wallace (Outro),Born Again,1999,"Hi I'm Voletta Wallace, Biggie's mom
I wish to thank you for your kind words
You warm gestures and your constant support over the years
I also need to share with you a few words about my son
Please take a few moments and listen
I hope you gain something from it, thanks
As a child Christopher was outspoken
When it suited him at times he was quiet
And of course he was mischievous as all little boys are
As a young man he liked to do everything
He liked to read, he liked to be with his friends
As young kids or young boys he enjoyed life
Everything that would make him happy or comfortable
He would do but mostly he enjoyed being with his friends and family
His early inspirations toward rap music were
The LL's of the world, the Sugar Hills, the Mr. Magics
And the Fat Boys of the rap channel
Those were all the things I heard in the house
Even though I called it noise and banging
I know now, it is a accepted musical art form
I was a single parent, I raised my son on my own
His father had no influence on his decision
Towards the musical outlet or career he chose
My son had a mind of his own, even if his father was around
He would have turned to rap he loved music, he loved rap
At a point in my son's life he developed paranoia
About death and about the dying
We are living in a world of imperfect human beings
Where greed, jealousy and envy
Are manifested by what others have accomplished in life
My son was very very much aware of that
He appreciated his station in life on the directions
In which he was going or traveling
On the other hand there were others
Who I should use the hip hop phrase player hating
And I think that is what resulted in his paranoia
If I had to change anything in my son's life
That would have allowed him to be here today
I would have deterred him from a career in music
I'm aware that millions appreciate his music, millions loved his music
Be that it may if he hadn't chosen that lifestyle, that career
My son would be alive today
If I could sum up Christopher in one word the word would be generous
The thing that my son loved most about life was the fact that
He was in a position to help, position to share
Position to give to others who needed, to others who wanted
To others appreciated the gifts that he gave",https://genius.com/The-notorious-big-ms-wallace-outro-lyrics

You hitting this nigga, how that sound?""
Huh, first of all you got me mixed up with
Somebody ya done slept with, hold up
That's my Neneh Cherry shit, I got something slicker
Let me just sip up on this liquor
All I wanna do is smoke a little chronic
Slam ya like Onyx, and get ya hooked on
This Biggie Smalls phonics, 102
How to squeeze 22's in them Reebok shoes, HUH?

I said walk me upstairs, cause I forgot my Phillies
She said ""I don't care, so don't be acting silly""
I knew I had her trapped with my hardcore raps
And it wouldn't take a second before I had her on her back
Pulling back the bra straps, threw on my Silk CD
Cause, ""I wanna get freaky with you""
Lose control on the skins is all I can picture, now I'm about to hit you

Can I get witcha (can I get witcha)
Can I get witcha (can I get witcha)
""Why you wanna get with me?""
Cause you got a big B-U-T, T

To all my hoes, respect due
Tamika sorry I left you
Michelle I'm glad I met you
You make the head feel special
Now I know it's official
That I can touch and tease you
Pull up my pants and diss you
And hit the door you came through
It's Cease-a-Lee, a.k.a. Mista Nasty
Germany style, these hoes they blast me
One of the chickenhead with sex appeal pass me
That's her hands, ankles, feet they ashy
I like the flashy type, who pass with dykes
With long hair, and they ass be right
I get up on that ass, see what that be like
I fuck a bitch good, if she ask me right, huh

Can I get witcha, can I get witcha
Can I get witcha, can I get witcha

Your shit it, just ain't got that LOUD
Gold tooth shine like TaaDow!
Biggie Smalls the illest and how, phrase raise your eyebrow
By now you figure, he talkin' bout that nigga
But your weak-ass assumptions, lead led to dumpin'
IV to pump-in, you're feeling something
Catch my drift, or catch my four-fifth lift
At least six inches, above project fences
Turn meat to minces, jumps turn to flinches
When I rain I drenches, cleared your park benches (HAH)

Fakes don't kill nuttin' but time and don't tussle
The process of elimination, fresh rotation
Come and go and they death be starvation
In the heat of battle it's no rest for the weary
Snooze and you lose is the theory
The theory of a patient man, is wild beyond belief
Be afraid, you don't want beef with us chief
Your talk is cheap and the supply meets demand
Everything you can imagine is real man
And revenge be the dish I serve to cats cold
Stay up on about ten folds, you know how it goes

I Really Want to Show You,Born Again (Advance Promo),1999,"Wooo! There's gonna be a lot of punchin' in this motherfucker!
Y'all better be swift with that punch button, Jack!
Biggie! - Biggie!

I know how it feel to wake up fucked up
Pockets broke as hell, another rock to sell
People look at you like youse the user
Selling drugs to all the losers, mad buddha abuser
But they don't know about your stress-filled day
Baby on the way mad bills to pay
That's why you drink Tanqueray; so you can reminisce
And wish, you wasn't livin so devilish, ssshit
I remember I was just like you
Smokin blunts with my crew, flippin over 62's
Cause G-E-D wasn't B-I-G
I had to get P-A-I-D that's why my mom's hate me
She was forced to kick me out, no doubt
Then I figured out licks went for twenty down South
Packed up my tools for my raw power move
Glock nineteen for casket and flower moves
For chumps tryin' to stop my flow
And what they don't know will show on the autopsy
Went to see Papi to cop me a brick
Asked for some consignment, he wasn't tryin' to hear it
Smoking mad Newports 'cause I'm due in court
For an assault that I caught in Bridgeport, New York
Catch me if you can like the Gingerbread Man
You better have your gat in hand cause man

Come and run with me - I really wanna show you
How I run the streets - I really wanna show you
How I'm clockin' G's - I really wanna show you
Come and run with me - I really wanna show you

I had the master plan
I'm in the caravan on my way to Maryland
With my man Two-Tecs to take over this projects
They call him Two-Tecs, he tote two TECs
And when he start to bust, he like to ask: ""
Who's next?
""
I got my honey on the Amtrak
With the crack in the crack of her ass
Two pounds of hash in the stash
I wait for hon to make some quick cash
I told her she could be Lieutenant
Bitch got gassed
At last, I'm literally loungin' black
Sittin' back, countin' double digit thousand stacks
Had to re-up; see what's up with my peeps
Toyota Deal-a-Thon had it cheap on the Jeeps
See who got smoked, what rumors was spread
Last I heard I was dead with six to the head
Then I got the phone call, it couldn't hit me harder
We got infiltrated like Nino at the Carter
Heard Tec got murdered in a town I never heard of
By some bitch named Alberta over nickel-plated burners
And my bitch swear to God she won't snitch
I told her: ""
When she hit the bricks I'll make the hooker rich!
""
Conspiracy - She'll be home in three
Until then I looks out for the whole family
A true G, that's me! Blowing like a bubble;
In the everyday struggle

Come and run with me - I really wanna show you
How I run the streets - I really wanna show you
How I'm clockin' G's - I really wanna show you
Come and run with me - I really wanna show you

I'm seeing body after body and our mayor Giuliani
Ain't tryin' to see no black
Man turn to John Gotti

Guns and diamonds
Bitches put they tongues where the sun ain't shinin'
Take keys 'til they spot us, snakes flee with consignment
This kid he got his crib raided, police found grams
They locked up, his whole fam; moms, sister, his old man
Nigga bailed his moms out, then he told on his man
Now they home, actin like nuttin wrong, hustlin again
He tried to be the next Frank White, and Escobar
Pickin up coke a fiend holds it in a separate car
Cooks it up til it's bright white, cut it tight right
Then he slings it to the fiends, lookin like Fright Night
Coppin the motorbikes, the scooters, countin dough on computers
High technology dealers, to the users and losers
Half-leg DiDi, try to swap drug for TV's
Stores run out of baking soda from BK to QB
My niggas die for the cause, .45 on the drawer
City laws made by Big Nas and Biggie Smalls
Bitches, holdin my weight in they titties and bras
My bitches out of state get busy while they pushin my cars
Callin me up, callin me baller, call for they cut
Pretty hoes bring me my cash, swallow all of this nut
Seats on the Bent' stay nasty, push the dash
For the stash box is where the cash be; watchin for task force
Cause I know they comin but I'm reachin my goal
Fuck bummin, I'm makin sure I leave this whole game wit somethin
Crib in West Palms for my dime, crib for my moms
Ridiculous, you lookin at the next Nicholas Barnes, baby",https://genius.com/The-notorious-big-i-really-want-to-show-you-lyrics
Tonight,Born Again (Advance Promo),1999,"(Yo, check this out, yeah motherfuckers)
(Come on motherfuckers, B.I.G. motherfuckers)
Too much smoke in here man
Open a fucking window
What the fuck man
Yo yo yo yo yo

I make your mouthpiece obese like Della Reese
When I release, you lose teeth like Lil' Cease
Nigga please, blood floods your Dungarees
And that's just the half of my warpath
Laugh now, cry later, I rhyme greater
Than the average player hater and spectators
Buy my CD twice, they see me in the streets
They be like, ""Yo he nice, but that's on the low though""
Be the cats with no dough, tried to play me at my show
I pull out fo'-fo's and go up in they clothes
Short-change niggas, snort-'caine niggas
Extortion came quicker, bought the Range, nigga
Ya still tickle me, I used to be as strong as Ripple be
'Til Lil' Cease crippled me
Now I play hard, like my girl's nipples be
The game sour like a pickle be, y'all know the rules
Move from BK to New Jeruz; thinking 'bout
All the planes we flew, bitches we ran through
Now the year's new, I lay my game flat
I want my spot back--take two
Motherfuckers mad 'cause I blew, niggas envious
Too many niggas on my dick, shit strenuous
When my men bust, you just move with such stamina
Slugs missed ya; 
I ain't mad at 'cha
Blood rushin', concussions ain't nothin'
Catch cases, come out fronting, smoking something
Sippin' White Russians, bitch in the Benz bumpin'
I laced it with the basic, six TV's a system
Knocking Mase shit; face it, we hard to hit
Guard your shit, 'fore I stick you for your re-up
Wipe the pee up, lick shots, woke your seed up
Go in the ashtray, spark the weed up, long kiss

Y'all can't see this
That this might be the night
This might be the night, that's right, that's right
This might be the night (Kiss your ass goodbye)

Niggas playing they hands wrong, that's why they won't last long
Finessed what I was dealt with from the day I was born
While you bent up on that corner, niggas plotting and scheming
Up in them little holes, be creeping with Mac demons
Niggas know not to fuck with my dough
Niggas know not to fuck with this little bro, I'm 10 seconds hit'n'go
Black mask, black truck, chrome rims, Chuk' Timbs
Enough to confuse any witness
Strongest of calibers, is what we only travel with
You gotta get hit, your man dead, so you got a hand in it
Extort y'all, once friends, now we gotta cross y'all
You know the niggas with the biggest balls set the new laws
And flip fours, have 'em washing drawers while you up North
Gat to your jugular, getting your salad tossed
Overhearing niggas situations, singing like Lou Rawls
Sitting on the stand with no remorse

Y'all can't see this
That this might be the night
This might be the night, that's right, that's right
This might be the night (Kiss your ass goodbye)

Yo, yo, how we do niggas, I don't beef, I shoot niggas
If I can't get the main character, a few niggas then
I don't need no gin to boost me
I got enough steam to blow, somebody gotta go
I got fire in my heart, guns in my car
Cash in my Carhartts, it ain't hard to get 'em
Like blaow when I hit 'em, the nigga shit his drawers
When the 40-pound hit him, the fuck these niggas thought?
Could it be the fame, maybe it's the 2 Benz or
Would it be the same if I couldn't claim those?
Fuckin' put holes through your Range Rove'
Cocksucker, beat it, while you bleedin' on the dashboard
Niggas get, what they hand call for, I'm gettin' rich
You get deaded, I get erections over revenge, kid
You get a quiet spot in the shade for a grave
I'll lay a nigga down and steam roll away...

And ya don't stop, and ya won't stop
And ya don't stop

I was a?terror?since the public?school era
Bathroom passes, cutting classes, squeezing?asses
Smoking blunts was a daily routine
Since 13, a chubby nigga?on?the?scene
I used to?have the trey-deuce
And?the deuce-deuce in my bubblegoose
Now I got the Mac in my knapsack
Lounging black, smoking sacks up in Ac's and Sidekicks
With my sidekicks rocking fly kicks
Honeys want to chat
But all we wanna know is where the party at
And can I bring my gat?
If not, I hope I don't get shot
Better throw my vest on my chest, 'cause niggas is a mess
It don't take nothing but fronting for me to start something
Bugging and bucking at niggas like I was duck hunting
Dumbing out, just me and my crew
'Cause all we wanna do is

Ladies from front to back
Sipping on Champagne glass
It's all where the party's at
(It's where the party's at)
Ladies creeping their ride
Pimping and getting high
To be where the party's at

Hugs from the honeys, pounds from the roughnecks
Seen my man Sage that I knew from the projects
Said he had beef, asked me if I had my piece
Sure do, two .22s in my shoes
Holler if you need me, love, I'm in the house
Roam and stroll, see what the honeys is about
Moet popping, ho hopping
Ain't no stopping Big Poppa
I'm a Bad Boy
Niggas wanna front, who got your back? (Biggie!)
Niggas wanna flex, who got the gat? (Biggie!)
It ain't hard to tell I'm the East Coast overdose
Nigga you scared you're supposed to
Nigga, I toast ya, put fear in your heart
Fuck up the party before it even start
Pissy drunk, off the Henny and skunk
On some Brand Nubian shit beating down punks

Ladies from front to back
Sipping on Champagne glass
It's all where the party's at
(It's where the party's at)
Ladies creeping their ride
Pimping and getting high
To be where the party's at

Bitches in the back looking righteous
In a tight dress, I think I might just
Hit her with a little Biggie 101, how to tote a gun
And have fun with Jamaican rum
Conversation, blunts in rotation
My man Big Jock got the Glock in his waist and
We're smoking, drinking, got the hooker thinking
If money smell bad, then this nigga Biggie stinking
Is it my charm? I got the hookers eating out my palm
She grabbed my arm and said ""Let's leave calm""
I'm hitting skins again
Rolled up another blunt, bought a Heineken
Niggas start to loc out, a kid got choked out
Blows was thrown and a fucking fight broke out
Can't we just all get along?
So I can put hickies on her chest like Little Shawn
Get her pissy drunk off of Dom Pérignon
And it's on, and I'm gone, that's that

Ladies from front to back
Sipping on Champagne glass
It's all where the party's at

Watch it spin, hey dad, placed your bet on seven
Peace to 106, 108, 110 and 111th
Hey Biggie, I understand you're from Brooklyn
With .22s in your shoes, yo, keep this joint cooking

Well, why not blow up the spot with Sadat?
Release the brainstorm to make your motherfucking brain warm
A strange form, something kind of lyrical
Biggie the bastard, Sadat's kind of spiritual
Well, in God we trust, guns I bust
Got that disgusting, sewer-style dumping
And, uh, do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that I bring?

I walk slight but I carries a big stick
Nobody pay me close, hey Biggie buy another toast
My shit is set off
Somebody screaming somebody is shot
Is it over Crack, or a nigga will try to act?
The big city don't spare no bodies
Call me papi chulo, to all the Spanish mamis
I'm in real form, ready to rush your dorm
Hold back your mom 'cause I came for your daughter
Is it time for slaughter, or should I pull the plug?
Sometimes I get wild lifted, and niggas tell me I bug
I claim now, this my set, somebody could be wet
Ayo Biggie, give me the word and I'll let out the herd
With that Uptown spliff, 45th inside the gift
And we can do this
Check it out

I got seven Mac-11's, about eight .38's
Nine 9's, ten Mac-10's the shits never end
You can't touch my riches
Even if you had MC Hammer and them 357 bitches
Biggie Smalls, the millionaire, the mansion, the yacht
The two weed spots, the two hot Glocks
Huh, that's how I got the weed spot
I shot dread in the head, took the bread and the Lambsbread
Lil' Gotti got the shotty to your body
So don't resist or you might miss Christmas
I tote guns, I make number runs
I give MCs the runs dripping
When I throw my clip in the AK, I slay from far away
Everybody hit the D-E-C-K
My slow flows remarkable, peace to Matteo
Now we smoke weed like Tony Montana sniff the llello

Microphone Murderer,Demo Tape,1991,"A whole lotta niggas want Big to make a demo tape
'Specially that, BUM-ASS NIGGA uhh
This goin out to you nigga recognize
Yo 50, what's this?
Microphone murderer, mass mayhem maker
B.I.G.'s on the mic, call the undertaker
Make an appointment, schedule a interview
Because you know what Big Man's about to do
50 Gran' on the Technic at the right peak
Brothers wanna hear the words Big Man speak
The microphone - I'm rippin', the burner got the clip in
Slammin MC's like Scottie Pippen
Flippin on Old Gold, cold as the rhymes you stole
Puffin on dime bags and I been told
My words are harder than a brick, Chinese arithmetic
A thick stick and my dick
Makes me sick when you pick the whick-whack rhyme G
You get what you pumpin is Tic-Tac time Z
B.I.G. moves swifter than a ninja
Even on stickups I'm the masked avenger
Keep my eyes open and the case closed
No eyewitnesses, no names are exposed
Just the heavyset one with the big gun
And a sweet tongue shakin down everyone
Loot like Michael Jackson kicks like Bo Jackson
Benz like Freddie Jackson, no need to ask in the crew
Oooh! No frontin, no fakin moves
Fightin or fuckin, resort to the stick and move
Smack the fool that disagree, recognize the pedigree
Rhyme is mine cause I said it's me
Step to a Big Man grippin the mic stand
Keep a bankroll and so do 50 Gran'
And, I give you my hand cause you deserve a pound
Tryin to blow up the spot, in my part of town
Braves, because you get no praise
I treat you like a derelict with AIDS
Recognize, I don't fuck with the St. Ides
B.I.G. down with O.G.B
Old Gold Brothers for the others that missed me
The crew stay deep on Bedford and Quincy
Rhymes in the pocket for a quick hand to hand
You want it to be on, there's a Tec in the garbage can
I pull bitches like Kim Fields, Brooke Shields
Shelley Long, Connie Chung, I can go on and on
Word is bond I'm a don~!
I split 'em and run up in 'em I fuck 'em and then I duck 'em
I hit 'em in the shitter and forget her, and it gets better

Special shoutout to my man
MC Homicide and DJ Fatal
Twin one and two my man Milk
My man Fred Dawg, the O.G.B. crew
Y'all know how we flow
And I'ma drop it like this y'all

Oh what a feeling! Drivin' in my four by four
Girlies galore, B.I.G. on the door
Chrome trimming with the smoke tint
Givin' chumps a hint as I count my mint
Stacks of doves, half my man's is C-note
All from sayin' rhymes that B.I.G. wrote
Blunt, I take a toke, but only if it's weed
Skunk with no seeds, a sip of Hennessy
Pass to D or maybe movin' solo
Never with a skeezer by my side, that's a no-no
Tell me I ain't the flyest nigga that you ever saw
Live in action, guaranteed raw!

Who's coming through? Y'all know who! (Who?!)

Bed-Stuy Brooklyn where this rapper was originated
Your rhymes ain't shit; they must be constipated
Many awaited the heavyset brother from Fulton Street
To drop a rhyme to a funky beat
Expellin MCs as if I was at Sarah J
Or boys and girls at any school around the way
Opponents, pupils, but I'm the principal
Hard to beat, damn near invisible
Niggas wanna know, how I live the mack life
Makin money smoking mics like crack pipes
Flippin' bombs, stayin' calm, givin' my people my palm
And sayin' rhymes is an opium bomb
Yes it's me, the B.I.G
Competition ripper ever since 13
Used to steal clothes, was considered a thief
Until I started hustlin' on Fulton Street
Makin' loot, knockin' boots on the regular
Pass the microphone I'm the perfect competitor
Jewels and all that, my clothes is all that
Chumps steppin' to me, that's where they took a fall at!
B.I.G. without burner, that's unheard of
I stay close to mine like Tina on Turner
Quick to smother a punk motherfucker
Undercover, word to mother, I'm above ya
And I love ya 'cause you're a sweet bitch
A crazy crab, ya might make my dick itch
I flow looser than Luther, words ya get used ta
B.I.G. is a born, trooper
Like ice cream I scoop ya
, my music you wanna get loose ta
Stay dipped and I'm not a booster
So what'cha got to say? This mackin' word is bond
There's no other assumption, I got it goin' on
I'm not conceited, my friends tell me this
Even my mother be noddin' her head to this
Makes her proud to see her one son get loud
Flip on a sucker and bow to the crowd
Drink a little Hennessy, smoke a blunt or 2 or 3 or 4
Live in action, guaranteed RAW
Round two the rhyme regulator here to roast ya
As ya follow this yeah, I gave a toast to ya crew
See, they popped on ya like a kernel
They didn't realize that the beef was eternal
Internal injury that's what you're soon to see
B.I.G. keeps company
Sometimes in my waist, if they come opponent
Run upstairs, change my skimmer and my coat and
I'll be floatin' to your punk part of town
Anybody fronting, they better duck down
Don't get mad 'cause I grazed ya
You jumped in that 4-door Blazer, quick I couldn't get a good hit
Shit, I was aimin' for the melon
But the kick of my three-pound auto there's no tellin'
Drink a little Hennessy, smoke a blunt or 2 or 3 or 4
Live in action, guaranteed raw!

And you don't stop, and you don't stop
You keep on
To my man Milk, and Thai
Like I said before the whole O.G.B. is in full effect

Love No Ho (Demo),Demo Tape,1991,"Yo Bigs, man, what's wrong man?
You look like you got problems man

Hey yo man, psh man..
It's this fuckin' bitch, man!
Shit, I know I ain't s'posed to have no feelings for these hoes out here man, but
This bitch on the back of my mind man (word?)
Yeah man... done wrote a rhyme 'bout the bitch man
(Let me hear it) Want me to drop the drama kid? (Yeah)
Yeah, dedicatin this to you man
Cause my man 50 Grand told me straight up and down man
I ain't 'sposed to love NO ho
Knahmsayin? I tried to tell her 50
I got three rules in life
I'm not to be played with, played on or played out
I'mma drop it like this

Lyin' in my bed, I'm lookin' at four walls
Echo in my head sayin' I got a lot of gall
Grippin' my cap, my pen in my teeth
Thinkin' what this ho said, she called me a thief
She said I stole her heart, and didn't leave a trace
I told her I was sorry, and she said ""get out my face""
Walked out my door with my Walkman in my pocket
Playin ""Love Is a House,""
 and thinkin how she jocked it
When she had the key, to open up my door
Adore, that Prince scan that bought me on the floor
I know that she loved me, I couldn't ever fake it
I say go buy a pie, the girl would go bake it
Makin' a record was important to me
More important than her that's what made her flee, see
The mistake was not payin' no mind
All her posse said we was ""two of a kind""
I call her back twice, your sister said you're broke
She said ""when you left, your ears was full of smoke
Chokin' on a cigarette, you don't even smoke!""
Jumped in the train station put in a token
Coulda been my partner, amigo, my peer
Just waitin' for them three words that all girls wanna hear
""I love you,"" huh, you would start to cry, if
I would reply with I.L.Y
Then I tell your friends that you played me out
Said I wouldn't say ""I love you"" just to make you shout
So I, call up 7 digits that would pick up your phone
Your sister picked it up and said that you wasn't home
I heard you in the back cryin' up a storm
Screamin' how you wish that I never was born
""I hate him! I hate him!"" That's what she kept sayin
She'll come to her senses is what I kept prayin'
But now I'm gonna lay the cards on the line
Just say that you hate me, or say that you're mine
I said, when I played ball you was in the stands
When I was sick, you held my hand
It was hard to say before, but now I can
Bitch, I love no ho, fuck ya!

I don't give a fuck about'cha
Take a long walk off a short pier, bitch
Tryna to take bankrolls
Bum bitches outta here 50, man
Now check this

Come to my crib, she say, ""B.I.G. listen
I don't like the way you been dissin'""
Feel like I been kissin' other bitches cause my lips feel chapped
I tell you ""it's from the blunts,"" you ain't tryin to hear that
Now I'm Henny'd like a fuck? What's the riff?
Who I'm sleepin with? 
I ain't got the time
To shoot the gift to hoes, I'm tryin to take bankroll
I ain't fuckin nobody, case closed
You hit the lights and decide to doze off
No kiss goodnight, didn't take your clothes off
And my dick is harder than a rock
Nobody to cockblock but you's a hardrock
The fuck you think I am, gay?
I ain't got no time to play I ain't got nothin' to say
Bounce out the crib, just to see my man 50
And what's up with B.I.G
And the O.G.B., you know they keep plenty hookers
And I ain't a bad looker
So I see one ho that I like yeah, oooh
Shit is cool
[Outro: The Notorious B.I.G., 
?
]
Trust no hoes, all they want is bankroll
That's what I'm tryin to tell you now baby
My man 50 done schooled me to all y'all hookers

If they watch TV in the Lex, they know
They know, quarter past 4
Left the club tipsy, say no mo'
Except how I'm gettin home tomorrow
Cease will drop you off when he see his P.O
Back of my mind I hope she swallow
Man she spilled a drink on my cream Wallows
Reach the gate, hungry just ate
Riffin, she got to be to work by eight
This must mean she ain't tryna wait
Conversate, sex on the first date
I state, ""You know what you do to me""
She starts off, ""Well I don't usually""
Then I whipped it out, rubber no doubt
Step out, show me what you all about
Fingers in your mouth, open up your blouse
Pull your G-string down South

By a Cherokee and a green drop-top

When I die, fuck it I wanna go to hell
Cause I'm a piece of shit, it ain't hard to fuckin' tell
It don't make sense, goin' to heaven wit' the goodie-goodies
Dressed in white, I like black Tims and black hoodies
God will probably have me on some real strict shit
No sleepin' all day, no gettin my dick licked
Hangin' with the goodie-goodies loungin' in paradise

I know my mother wished she got a fuckin' abortion

Woman hold her head and cry
Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died

Throw the Magnum to my head, threaten to pull shit
And squeeze, until the bed's, completely red
I'm glad I'm dead,

The stress is buildin' up, I can't
I can't believe suicide's on my fuckin' mind
I want to leave

I swear to God I feel like death is fuckin' callin' me
Naw you wouldn't understand
You see its kinda like the crack did to Pookie, in New Jack
Except when I cross over, there ain't no comin' back
Should I die on the train track, like Remo in Beatstreet
People at the funeral frontin' like they miss me
My baby momma kissed me but she glad I'm gone
She knew me and her sister had somethin' goin' on
I wonder if I died, would tears come to her eyes?
Forgive me for my disrespect, forgive me for my lies

Woman hold her head and cry
Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died

Just Blaze, niggas

There's no way out, it seems I can't get free
Somebody tell me what's happened to me

The country bud got me chokin'
I'm on a mission to the point that motherfuckers think I'm smokin'
Yeah, that sick nigga Biggie with the 8-shot fifth
With the extra clip for that extra shit
Don't you know that a killing is thrilling?
All the blood spilling is all a part of drug dealing
A born gangsta, my daddy was a thug
Had a .38 with the hollow point slug
So when he licked shots
Niggas dropped quicker than a bootlegger sells his liquor
A little nigga tried to squeeze .22's in my Reebok shoes
Payin' dues, while kids was on their one's and two's
Now I'm much older, colder, fuck a holster
Got the MAC-11 swingin' from my shoulder
It's a damn shame I got to put my momma through the strain
I'm livin' in a house of pain

Is anybody listenin'? Tell me can you can see
This darkness surrounding me
Now it's gettin' colder heavy on my shoulder
And it's gettin' hard to breathe
Vision's gettin' blurry, I'm gettin' worried
'Cause it's gettin' hard to see
When you're livin' in the House of Pain

The motherfuckin' dust kicker, who can you trust?
Do you have the heart to see a nigga, before you bust?
My name is spoken on the tongues of so many foes
Bustin' motherfuckers out the box, I ain't even go!
Now how the hell do you explain my claim to fame?
From doin' flicks to bustin' tricks out the fuckin' frame
Got these bitches on my jock, niggas on my block
Jealous ass suckers got 'em duckin' from my smokin' Glock
And bustin' niggas asses to stay alive
Skinny ass player watchin' bigger motherfuckers fry
They ask me how I'm livin', high, I'm a hustler
Buckin' busters 'til they die
Now it's on in the ghetto, you ain't heard?
Niggas got they AK's headin' for the 'burbs
Aimin' at them skinhead bitches, let it rain
Givin' 'em a wet welcome to the House of Pain

Is anybody listenin'? Tell me can you can see
This darkness surrounding me
Now it's gettin' colder heavy on my shoulder
And it's gettin' hard to breathe (MJB)
Vision's gettin' blurry, I'm gettin' worried (Be worried, niggas)
'Cause it's gettin' hard to see (Yeah, Nas)
When you're livin' in the house of pain
(What up, B.I., Pac?)

Wendy Williams say I stayed dusted, maybe I should
'Cause these rappers'll have your phone tapped like Savion Glove'
And on the West, yo, police corrupt, some are Bloods
But these Teflons I loaded explodin' some mugs
I'm like Furious in Boyz n the Hood, but at the drive-thru
I ain't runnin', I'm dumpin', crazy like a Piru
And loc'd up, know how Nas do
I'm callin' Henchmen and Concepcion, to organize a black truce
Then we party hard, party with Nas
Since there ain't no more - Mardi Gras
And Bush won't apologize
I got gangsta hoes Kobe Bryant scared to sodomize
And .45's for them suckers y'all idolize
Y'all yellin' my name, but y'all soon dyin'
Tryin' to portray real but they be lyin'
'Cause they want the real niggas to die so they could gain
But never that, this ain't Everlast, this the House of Pain

Is anybody listenin'? Tell me can you can see
This darkness surrounding me
Now it's gettin' colder heavy on my shoulder
And it's gettin' hard to breathe
Vision's gettin' blurry, I'm gettin' worried
'Cause it's gettin' hard to see
When you're livin' in the house of pain",https://genius.com/The-notorious-big-living-in-pain-lyrics
Hustler’s Story,Duets: The Final Chapter,2005,"Akon and B.I.G. yea

Niggas talkin' it but ain't livin' it
Cristal pops I'm sippin' it, mob hats and lizard shit
'Gator trunks bitch, rollin' blunts with the williest of the willy
Heckler Koch, M-1's and nine millies
Stories like a motherfucker
Model bitches wondering if I'm a fuck with her
She know I treats my bitches like Ivana
Dolce and Gabana drippin'
Big Poppa never slippin'
H-class diamonds shinin'
Dinner with the wifey winin', dinin'
Smoking cigars in Bogotá
With Colombian niggas named Panama
And Englique and shit
Games we play life endin'
Bitches bending over with ease
For a pair of Moschino jeans
And Donna Karan tank tops I got your bank stopped
Singles on top
Benjamins
Under the rest of 'em
Advancin'
From duplex to mansion
Stashing keys hidin' G's overseas
VCR's in my V's
Game elevates, money I make
Gets your stocks and real estates, bitch
Jet skiing in the Caribbean, white sands
Discussing plans with my mans
Dark blue land, smoke tint chrome rims and system
That leaves your rear views tremblin'
What you gonna do when poppa catch an attitude?
Drop to your knees and show gratitude
Kiss my rings it's a Frank White thing I stay potent
Bitch is devoted, take my dick and deep throat it

Eternal sunshine in this elevated world of mine
Looking for this hour glass of time
Trying to find my purpose on this grand design
Is there anybody out there living?
4-5-6 is on the streets, they shootin
Is there any money out there for me?
You just listen to this husler's story

Picture me, a product of the zone three
Scared lost, don't know what I'm suppose to be
Shit cost, money never came to me
When shit short, I suffered unshamelessly
The lord humble niggas 'specially if they act like
They too big for they draw when they stacks right
Think I'm bullshittin'? A bunch of niggas back like
Right back hungry, stacks gone, they forgot Christ
I know a nigga sold his soul for a nickel rock
I know some hoes for the dro you can hit the cock
I know a nigga workin' 9-5
Been on 15 years, ain't got a car to drive
I know some nigga wanna act hard, flicks pitch
Fake jack boys, can't rob, get killed
Got kin folk backyard big whips
Escart that lift my homeboy this year


Akon

While B.I.G. sittin up with Englique
I'm on the coastline politickin' wit Jose
We got the birds flyin' in the coop all day
Tryin' to find a new way to smugglin' pure yay'
We bout our business, ain't no small time thieves
If you ain't growin the 'caine then we ain't gon' meet
See I'm the one to call when things get deep
And my Africans will put yo' main man to sleep, now
And Mexico far from the block
Tryin' to figure out how many Glocks to a box, now
Sellin' arms as well as rocks in my socks
If you could show me the money, here's the keys to the lock, now
Hey, you know the streets is my territory
Ain't scared of nothin, let you fear it for me
Hey, whether win, lose or draw
Believe that death is waitin for all


Face Mob in the buildin (Uh huh)
Niggas is quick to chop rocks and hide hands
Make a break for it, get away from it, that was the plan (but)
So the whole time, I been plottin' on his man
Caught him slippin' and sleepin', I hit his ass wit the can, and
Here's somethin' that you can't understand
How can one be so cold and snatch a nigga's soul? (Damn)
I'm on some get back shit, there comes a time
In every man's mind when it's deeper than dollar signs
I been on the grind, got homies doin' time
Behind niggas actin like bitches and bitches droppin' dimes
I'm duckin' indictments, pussies is wearing wires
Niggas just ain't tellin', no, they know we let it slide
But nah, we gotta ride and him, he gotta die
So if you catch up to his ass before I catch him, give him mine
The rats one thing a real nigga here despise
I'm a five K one killa, I set his ass on fire",https://genius.com/The-notorious-big-hustlers-story-lyrics
It Has Been Said,Duets: The Final Chapter,2005,"It has been said, that there has been known to be bloodshed
Over bread, men who have bled to death, dead
Strapped to beds, pipe bombs, dynamite, lead
Money, power, respect, street cred, yeah
It's scary ain't it? Picture yourself going out as a hero
Picture mural pictures of us painted all over street corners
Fans meet to mourn us, while we meet the coroners
Notorious tried to warn us
We watched, so many piggybacked off of
Biggie's back and 'Pac's, landmarks, history in rap
Statistically in fact; it's so sad to see us re-enact
These tragic events, which lead us back
To where we left off on March 9th
To come from such hard knock lives
And make it up out of 'em, hit the spotlights
And, once they're on us this is our lives
Thrust out for all eyes to cast upon us
To see who can last the longest
And he who lasts the longest, must be the strongest
In this concrete jungle, where this dog eat dog mentality comes from
It's origin, which is usually originated from cats who starving
Or it could just be somebody's 
horror
, that just horri-fies
And applies to his persona or the sizes
In his entou-rage, that intimidates the people
To the point that you know that he's gangster
He ain't just say shit, you just believe it

Since B.I.G. taught us niggas to think big
I'm been about my business since then, so anxious
It ain't how we live, it's what he said, he did it for Brooklyn
This I took in, sent chills through my skin
Vicious, I'm experiencing the same sights as him
It's what excited Obie to write these poems
Rolling, going through the same shit he spoken
Open up my eyes so there's no limit in them skies
When Ready to Die was a sick part of my life
Palming that forty-five, plotting to pop my mind
Then that crooked eye Jamaican I'd so many times rewind
Got me to walk a straight line and get up on my grind
Get up out the system, who could give him better signs
No pop of mine could top Big Poppa rhymes
So possibly I'd be popular, huh?
That's the inspiration I got from my nigga B.I

I took him from coal to diamond,
 I molded his mind
Enter the most phenomenal artist of any and all time
I made a Frankenstein, my design impressed
Backpackers and press who said my house was a mess
Critics lashed, said I made a fortune off of his passing
All I did was build a dynasty, off of his passion
And I'm addressing the adolescents absent to who he is
The original king of New York, Christopher Wallace
This is a promise on Diddy's honor, I'm a father T'Yanna
And teach her that with all the drama don't even bother
On repeat, all of your albums play back to back
And I visit your grave cause our friendship's intact
An immaculate concept, extravagant progress
Bullet wounds left in my heart, I'm yelling ""God bless""
Regardless to critics yelling that East/West
I seen the game losing, I'm just pressing the reset
And when the resurrection of you shines through an individual
Lyrical enough to wear the same crown of thorns literally
I'mma pay homage, Brooklyn's finest
Whether it's Queens or Harlem it'll be instant stardom, nigga (nigga)",https://genius.com/The-notorious-big-it-has-been-said-lyrics

Where the cash at? Where the stash at?
I'll blow that ass back for fronting on a nigga like me
You got nothing on a nigga like me, you'll see
I'm on the grind from sun up to sun down
If I'm lying, may lightning come down and strike me right now
I'll turn a dollar to a twenty to a fifty to a hundred
Keep it coming 'til I'm full on my stomach
I'm stuck in my ways, I'm stuck puffing my haze
Hand on my pistol, front of it sprays
I'm stuck living the life of a ghetto nigga
Trying to get rid of the life, alright?

One in the chamber, the safety is off, released
Straight at your dome, holmes, I wanna see cabbage

Doing your brain cells much damage

Mic gripper, girl stripper, the Henny sipper
I drop lyrics off and on like a light switch
Quick to grab the right bitch and make her drop with you
.45 Glocks and Tecs are expected when I wreck shit
Respect is collected, so check it
I got techniques dripping out my butt cheeks
Sleep on my stomach so I don't fuck up my sheets

Beef is when your moms ain't safe up in the streets

Beef is when you roll no less than thirty deep
Beef is when I see you

Slim Thugga!
I roll strapped Glock 40 in my lap
I rap but still think like I'm grinding in the trap
Trying to adapt to the change from the streets to the game
Can't be selling CD's and still selling dem thangs
Cause snitches drop names and bring alot of problems
And putting somthing in they head the only way you gonna solve em'
Jackas stay plotting watching your every move
And the minute you snooze will be the minute you lose, dude
Thats the rules so I cruise with the tools
To fix the damn fools that think I'm slipping with my jewels
Breakin old habits so hard to do
Thats why you see me on the same block with the same crew
And everybody sitting fat living good
And I'm the only nigga that be rapping in my hood
I was raised by the hustlas, and ganged by the G's
And taught by the bosses how to stack that cheese

You got rich and G shit is still a part of you
Cause breakin old habits so hard to do
You still watch for the haters and the robbing crew
Cause breakin old habits so hard to do
When on shot that nigga like I started to
Cause breakin old habits so hard to do
Fresh out the dealership crackin open cigars in the coupe
Man cause breakin old habits so hard to do

Damn it feel good to see people up on it
Flipped two keys in two weeks and didn't flaunt it
My brain is haunted, with mean dreams
GS's with BB's on it, supreme schemes, to get Richer
Than Richie, quickly, niggas wanna hit me
If they get me, dress my body in linen by Armani, check it
My lyrical carjack, make your brains splat
High caliber gats is all I fuck with, now peep the rough shit
In my circumfrence, mad bitches, with mad lucci
Bulletproof vestes under they coochie
Spittin my uzi, don't lose me, my trigga niggas represent
Drivin dirty in J-30's gettin bent
And to my hit hoes, my murder mommies
I be smokin trees in Belize when they find me
While you still killin niggas with punany, like Connie
And Cyrus up in Cypress fuck you raw, you on the floor with the virus
While I just, slang coke, smoke pounds to choke
Got lawyers watchin lawyers so I won't go broke, now check it
Them country niggas call me Frank White
I'm squirtin off in my loft of course I know my shit's tight
Sunrise open my eyes no surprise
Got my shorty flying in with keys taped to her thighs
With all the utensils, who hang my china thing
She half black half oriental eighty-six she got me rentals


I used to drive a Chevy Monte Carlo, bricks of blow all in it
I was taught to sell the shit, you put your nose all in it
Let my bitch drive the Benz but the Rolls off limits
How you call yourself pimpin, with hoes all in your buisness
What it is, the music business or the streets make a decision
I do this in my sleep, and you way out your division pimp
This game we play for keeps, and the rules remain hidden
This ain't a place for lames and that snitching shit is forbidden
After sitting in the kitchen and whipping with hopes of getting back
All that off a brick to go blow it, so it even 50 stacks
And now I'm sitting back, thinking about a time
When a nigga get a 100 g's, think he went down
But now look for loyalty in the game, it ain't there
And things ain't the same they changed it ain't fair
Real niggas dead, doing their time and ain't here
You commit the same crime and come home the same year",https://genius.com/The-notorious-big-breakin-old-habits-lyrics

Ya'll fools trippin' out, that why I'm on a different route

With genuine skills to pay the heat, gas, and the rest of the bills

And papi got it good, he could put you on
Listen, I done made abandoned blocks look hot
Nine to ten Benzes, a couple of drops
Couple of rubber bands from the corrupt cops
Just to see my niggas eat and shit and huggin' the blocks
Crack a chastise 'em, right besides 'em
In front of a hundred million viewers, shouldn't surprise 'em
We from the Bronx where the may-ors lift up
And niggas get shot in broad day 'cause we don't give a...
Fuck, little niggas on bike and just shoot you
All for a pair of some Nikes, the shit's brutal
I done seen fiends O.D., shot the wrong pack
Then they call the shit the bomb smack
Word to Crack, the God body, the hard body, the realest ever
The John Gotti, this rap shit, will it kill me? Never

This goes out to cats (stupid), fingers in they ass again
Fifty dollar half-a-men, daydreamin'
Fuck around get wet like semen, your whole team-and
Be Mor-gan than Freeman
I took the cream and, moved to new places new faces
Fuck the screwfaces, 'cause when I flip
I make the papers, dangerous, we Goodfellas
Niggas can't bang with us, try to do me
My crew be unruly (what)
Some old school cats that call gats toolies
Call blacks moolies, think it's cool to smoke woolies
And fuck without rubbers (what), specialize
In killin' wives and grandmothers, who ya trustin', shit
When Frank start bustin', Frank start somethin'
Killin' ya gently, God meant me, to push a Bentley
Me and Sean Combs takin' broads home
On the phone with the chip, with these Cristal chicks

You see, I don't sweat these hoes
I keep 'em in flavors like Timbos and Girbauds

It was me, Dee, the MPV
The blunts and brew thang, knockin' some Wu-Tang
M-E-T-H-Oh shit, look at them lips and them hips on that bitch
Dee hit the dip, so I can drop my mackadocious shit
Light the blunt clip, and recognize a pimp
Needless to speak, the Gee's obsolete
Don't sleep! Banged the skins in a week
On the creep up the avenue
I seen her on the block, who she rappin' to?
That's my nigga Dee, damn he got Gee
Now she fuckin him and fuckin me, see

Mi casa, you casa (Oh)
I ain't lookin for no wife
I just wanna give dick to ya (Oh)

You make a motherfucking thug wanna sing (Oh Oh)
Baby baby, can't you see? (Whoa)
We gon' fuck until six in the mornin (Whoa)

Now I play her far like a moon play a star
She still sweat me hard cause I'm a rap star
I be cruisin up the block, I be passin her
Pimpin hard with the female passenger
And the only time I call her to hang
Is when me and Dee blunted up, pissy, schemin on a gang-bang
She should've used her intuition
Then she wouldn't be classified in that position, listen
She's sayin I dissed her cause I'm fuckin her sister
A message to the fellas, that really gets 'em pissed, uh
But she started that fuckin family
She fucked my man Dee, so why she mad at me?
Plus your sister look better than you
Give head better than you, pussy get wetter than you
So break the fuck out like a rash
I'm glad I ain't spend no cash to hit yo' nasty ass

Red bows, stilettos do please
Hit fellas to show off yo' booty
I'm hangin wit the best of them, sweet
If you wanna, I'm a veteran
When I show up to the club, it's V-I-P (Oh)
When they dressin in the club if it's B.I.G. (Ooh wee)
I'm not lookin to find a wife (Find a wife)
Just someone to make a friend of mine

Mi casa, you casa (Oh)
I ain't lookin for no wife
I just wanna give dick to ya (Oh)

Baby baby, can't you see? (Whoa)
We gon' fuck until six in the mornin (Whoa)

I roll up, the black Impala
I'm so high when I walk in the club
I see this chick that used to get the dick
Now she freakin on the floor, make a nigga reminisce
Ah, wanna back in my ride again
But I don't want no girlfriend
See I just wanna hit it and we can be cool
We can do this if you feelin the same way too
Come on girl, lets go to my hotel
After party all night in my hotel
Pop mo', smoke 'dro in my hotel
In twenty minutes, girl hit me on my cell

Mi casa, you casa (Oh)

Strictly gun testing, coke measuring
Giving pleasure in the Benz-ito
Hitting fanny, spendin chips at Manny's
Hope you creeps got receipts, my peeps get dirty like cleats
Run up in your crib, wrap you in your Polo sheets
Six up in your wig piece, nigga decease
Muah!, may you rest in peace
With my Sycamore style, more sicker than yours
Four-four, and fifty-four draw
As my pilot, steers my Leer

Climb the ladder to success, escalator style

My back don't bend, see papi is my kenfolk
Spin out the work, as if it's on a ten spoke
Soul benefactor the benz, he made the rims poke
Trust me they can't touch P, in one touchie
Turn drop-head coupe to dune-buggy
Admire the verses, their inspired by the hearses
That carried my niggas, and had the church mothers cursing
Imagine the glamour that comes out the flow
Of a nigga who still play in the snow like Santa
The wrist is rushing, my ears is blushing
And the diamonds in my chain, big as grandma's buttons, (yes!)
On the flipside, the steel I'm gripping
You thought all the floss had me slipping?
Think again, blink again let me know that your bluffing
Lead give permanent concussion, you're nothing


Ha ha ha ha ha check out the facade
On the face of rap, so we gon raise the bar
A mil on the crib, mean a quarter on the car
Bentley coupe another short of the arnage
Even as a youth I was loitering the stoop
Underneath the nose, and the Feds had no clue
I was pushing keys in a V with no roof
Rich, black, two big guns and no coof
Things at the label, well they tend to get unstable
And that pretty much leave Malice at the table
Or over the stove with the flame to the ladle
Because I'm a provider as long as I am able
This here hughe the most foolish of blues
When I tell my mom the price
She damn near sent me to my room

At the bar, tippin' wit your money, can you pay the difference?
It seems like it's a waste of time, that's why I wrote the rhyme
I hear you jump in every car, except for mines
Nigga, I don't jump in cars, I'm a superstar
Face way to flaw, you should hang me on your wall
All I do all day is drink Tanqueray
Thinking of a way to put a smile on your face
Make me smile, see them teeth, me look cute down to them features
My waste, my physique, me don't want freak-a-leek
Should I wine and dine? You put ring on your fingers
While sex from the next man in the bedroom lingers
Sex will never linger, hold up, put up the blinkers
I flow just like sprinklers, give yo ass the middle finger
You better slow your roll baby, you ain't got enough dough to pay me
You know the pin number, just page me when you will baby

Love Is Everlasting (Outro),Duets: The Final Chapter,2005,"(Biggie mom)
Let's say there are many times I looked
And saw reflections of my son
I argued sometimes, consulted;
I saw results, and said ""Well done.""
I thought of him constantly
And silently asked ""Why?""
I tried fervently
And just cannot say goodbye
I lived with visions twined and twisted
Passion so cold
And withered thoughts, battered and shattered
I dreamed dreams
Cherished memories
Housed friendship
And promises that mattered
In the end
Time is treasured;
But love for my son?
It's everlasting",https://genius.com/The-notorious-big-love-is-everlasting-outro-lyrics

Heads still bouncin'
Tell the DJ what we want (Biggie Smalls! Uh)
We want Biggie

So you wanna be hardcore
With your hat to the back
Talking about the gats in your raps
But I can't feel that hardcore
Appeal that you're screaming
Maybe I'm dreaming
This ain't Christopher Williams, still some
MC's got to feel one
Caps, I got to peel some
To let niggas know (let 'em know!)
That if you fuck with big-and-heavy
I get up in that ass like a wedgie
Says who - says me, the lyrical
Niggas saying: ""Biggie off the street, it's a miracle!""
Left the drugs alone, took the thugs along with me
Just for niggas acting shifty
Sticks and stones break bones, but the gat'll kill you quicker
Especially when I'm drunk off the liquor
Smoking funk by the boxes, packing Glocks
It's natural to eat you niggas like chocolates
The funk, baby

When they ask us what we want (the funk)

Man I love for the funk, I'll kill that wheel
Nigga fucking large I'm in the NFL
Killer, the man on fire like Denzel
I rock steady, my heat'll make your wind-mill
That's real, dot, R-A-W, straight out my mother womb
Right to the rubber room, I'm psycho, automatics
Since a younging, blowing funk boosts with half-sticks
I ain't give a fuck, now I'm trying to own a mountain
Standing on it yelling ""regular!""
B. Smalls, Nate Dogg on the same beat
We fuck hoes, send 'em home like the Yankees
Brick City, yeah nigga, a threat
That's how I act when Bad Boy cut Killa a check
Yep, haha

Real talk, nigga, Flip Mode Squad's in the building
Put your ones up, tribute the god, look
All gathered around, bounce to the funk
Got the whole club stink with the aroma of the skunk
Now, bang it out the trunk, nigga, ain't nothing change
Rep Big in a horde, like he still on St. James
Check it, nigga gon' see why we try
We continue to rep the funk in the name of the god B.I
Get dressed, mamis try to step up in the spotlight
We honoring one of the greatest,  yes we gotta rep him right

Realized I was a pimp and not just a player

It's not a game, it's war, plain and raw
Blood stain the wall when I bring the chain with the saw
Bring the pain to your door like death was knockin'
Unless you got my ends, I'ma make you twins
With the Headless Horseman, hell extortion
Sell your soul, live your dreams, don't pay the cost then
Chop, chop, say hello to the guillotine
A killer fiends for blood, screams of thugs like
Fiends for drugs, I don't need no love
Give me your fear, money, respect, beer, honeys and sex
We're here, I'll bend them checks for years, hungry and stressed
You fuckin' with Chris, fuck Pun, dead the wrath for later
Get your calculator, the head decapitator's back forever
Can't count how many heads I had to sever (Woo, c'mon)
Half the niggas I keep, and put 'em back together
That's the terror, cut open your girl
And make a truss out her flesh, like Buffalo Bill
[Chorus: Big Pun &

It's not a game, it's war, plain and raw
Blood stain the wall when I bring the chain with the saw
It's not a game, it's war, plain and raw
Blood stain the wall when I bring the chain with the saw
It's not a game, it's war, plain and raw
Blood stain the wall when I bring the chain with the saw (
Get on yo knees, nigga, get on yo knees and pray
)
It's not a game, it's war, plain and raw
Blood stain the wall when I bring the chain with the saw

No insanity plea from me, I ride the beef 'til I burn
Censor me and bar your kids from the lessons I learned
And in turn I'm hostile, guess you can recall me antisocial
Niggas shakin' like they caught the Holy Ghost when I approach
Try to politic before I smoke 'em, like Sun Tzu
Niggas do unto these snitches, before it's done to you
And if the cops come arrest me in the evening
Best believe they comin' for my dogs in the morning
And if I die by a slug, the death of a true thug
Tell me will my niggas mourn me? Gettin' blowed out
High, watch me murder the bird before he testify
Strikes walkin' close to my third, I live a troubled life
And if you dream, be a part of my team
From Long Beach to Queens
Drug dealers to ex-fiends
Keep yo eyes on the prize, nigga watch for bustas (Watch)
Either heaven or jail, it's still hell for a hustler

It's not a game, it's war, plain and raw
Blood stain the wall when I bring the chain with the saw
It's not a game, it's war, plain and raw
Blood stain the wall when I bring the chain with the saw
It's not a game, it's war, plain and raw
Blood stain the wall when I bring the chain with the saw
It's not a game, it's war, plain and raw
Blood stain the wall when I bring the chain with the saw

I got seven Mac-11's, about eight .38's
Nine 9's, ten Mac-10's the shits never end
You can't touch my riches
Even if you had MC Hammer and them 357 bitches
Biggie Smalls, the millionaire, the mansion, the yacht
The two weed spots, the two hot Glocks
Huh, that's how I got the weed spot
I shot dread in the head, took the bread and the lamb spread
Lil' Gotti got the shotty to your body
So don't resist or you might miss Christmas
I tote guns, I make number runs
I give MCs the runs dripping
When I throw my clip in the AK, I slay from far away
Everybody hit the D-E-C-K
My slow flows remarkable, peace to Matteo
Now we smoke weed like Tony Montana sniff the yayo
That's crazy blunts, mad L's
My voice excels from the avenue to jail cells
Oh my God I'm dropping shit like a pigeon
I hope you're listening, smacking babies at they christening
So you better grab your pistol
'Cause if you sit still, I'm gonna make your fucking shit spill
And I'm talking 'bout buckets, why did I have to do it?
Fuck it, you got a gun, nigga bust it

It's not a game, it's war, plain and raw
Blood stain the wall when I bring the chain with the saw
It's not a game, it's war, plain and raw
Blood stain the wall when I bring the chain with the saw
It's not a game, it's war, plain and raw
Blood stain the wall when I bring the chain with the saw
It's not a game, it's war, plain and raw
Blood stain the wall when I bring the chain with the saw

Jealous females, call you sluts and whores
Could it be my hardcore metaphor
Make sweat pour on the bedroom floor
Open up the Lex door, jump on in
I'm kind of tired, I'ma roll blunts while you spin
You got your license, right? Aight, no swerving
Hair blonde out, Madonna style like a virgin
Splurging, Dom P., Ro-se
Much foreplay, that's my forte
Niggas see the ring, baguettes to death
She looking for a man, honey he just left
Violate me, he get beat to death
Goodfellas squeeze every shell they got left

Got her own paper, shorty never blowing her own ki

See, the pimp shit be kinda killin' em softly
If you violate, the price for that could be kinda costly
Baby girl, now, even though you look finger-lickin'
Always remember, I'm careful with every chicken I'm pickin', listen
You see my shorty always stay on the grind
Bitches be jealous of my shorty and hating what's mine
'Cause Biggie told my shorty, ""You chickens is way out of line""
She gettin' money, focus on me, and she pay no mind, tricker
You think I'm bugging? Tell me, how do you figure?
I got a shorty that ain't trying to take a thing from a nigga

All I do is sit and think of ways I can come up
Catching jooks and run up, and leave your nigga done up
My pockets are hurting, homie, I ain't feeling this shit
Have your mama screaming (""Baby, move, it's a hit!"")
I ain't Scarface -- ""No women, no kids"" -- I don't give a fuck
Better teach that bitch and that little nigga to duck
With a P90 Ruger I put shots all through ya
If you survive, you gon' feel what talons do to ya
I'm a hard-headed nigga, I came up so hard
Had to get shot 9 times for me to find God
If them planes hit the projects, nobody would care
Look around, ain't nothing but black folks around here
We brothers become political and start to maneuver
They give you 100 years, man, they did it to Hoover
Now, you can hate me or love me
When you see me, busts shots or come and hug me

H-class diamonds shinin', dinner with wifey winin', dinin'
Smoking cigars in Bogotá with Colombian niggas named Panama
And Englique and shit, games we play life endin'
Bitches bending over with ease for a pair of Moschino jeans
And Donna Karan tank tops, I got your bank stopped
Singles on top, Benjamins under the rest of 'em
Advancin' from duplex to mansions
Stashing keys hidin' G's overseas, VCR's in my V's
Game elevates money I make into stocks and real estates, bitch
Jet skiing in the Caribbean, white sand
Discussing plans with my man
Dark blue land, smoke tint chrome rims and a system
That leaves my rear views tremblin'

Drop to your knees and show gratitude
Kiss my ring, it's a Frank White thing I stay potent

Wonderin' if they finally caught up with ya

You know the epilogue by James Todd Smith
I get swift with the lyrical gift
Hit you with the dick, make your kidneys shift
Here we go, here we go, but I'm not Domino
I got the funk flow to make your drawers drop slow
So recognize the dick size in these Karl Kani jeans
I'm in thirteens, know what I mean
I fuck around and hit you with the Hennessy dick
Mess around and go blind, don't get to see shit
The next batter, here to shatter your bladder, it doesn't matter
Skinny or fat or light-skinned or black, baby, I drop these
Boricua mommies screamin' ""Ay papi!""

I only smoke blunts if they rolled propa
Look, I gotcha caught up with the drunk flow
Fuck tae kwon do, I tote da fo'-fo'
For niggas gettin' mad cause they bitch chose me

All I do is separate the game from the truth
Big bang boots from the Bronx to Bolivia

How come you and your sis make similar faces
When I come you be cryin' like I'm killin' ya bitches
Knows when picture in the camera rollin
Cause I only be knowin' how the shit's unfolded
Back shots to the rear, got the mac unloaded
Got a reload, like every so often
You sayin' I got my swagger back
I'm lookin' like bitch, my swagger never left

They actors, and the fact is, you want that old thing back

I'm glad because her cousin let me hit the ass
Fuck the past let's dwell on the 500 SL, the E and J and ginger ale
The way my pockets swell to the rim with Benjamins
Another hon's in the crib, please send her in
I fuck non-stop, lick my lips a lot, used to lick the clits a lot
But lickin' clits had to stop
Cause y'all don't know how to act when the tongue go down below
Peep the funk flow, really though
I got the cleanest meanest penis, ya never seen this stroke of genius
So take off your Tim boots and your bodysuit
I mean the spandex and hit my man next

Sometimes your words just hypnotize me
And I just love your flashy ways
Guess that's why they broke, and you're so paid
Biggie, Biggie, Biggie, can't you see? (Uh-huh)
Sometimes your words just hypnotize me (Hypnotize)
And I just love your flashy ways (Uh-huh)
Guess that's why they broke, and you're so paid (Ha)

I put hoes in NY onto DKNY (Uh-huh)
Miami, D.C. prefer Versace (That's right)
All Philly hoes go with Moschino (Come on)
Every cutie with a booty bought a Coogi
Now who's the real dookie? Meaning, who's really the shit?
Them niggas ride dicks, Frank White push the six
Or the Lexus, LX, four and a half
Bulletproof glass, tints if I want some ass
Gonna blast, squeeze first, ask questions last
That's how most of these so-called gangsters pass
At last, a nigga rappin' about blunts and broads
Tits and bras, ménage à trois, sex in expensive cars
I'll still leave you on the pavement
Condo paid for, no car payment (Uh-uh)
At my arraignment, note for the plaintiff
""Your daughter's tied up in a Brooklyn basement""
Face it, not guilty, that's how I stay filthy (Not Guilty)
Richer than Richie, 'til you niggas come and get me (Come on)

Biggie, Biggie, Biggie, can't you see?
Sometimes your words just hypnotize me
And I just love your flashy ways
Guess that's why they broke, and you're so paid
Biggie, Biggie, Biggie, can't you see? (Uh-huh)
Sometimes your words just hypnotize me (Hypnotize)
And I just love your flashy ways (Uh-huh)
Guess that's why they broke, and you're so paid

I can fill you with real millionaire shit (I can fill ya)
Escargot, my car go, one sixty, swiftly (Come on)
Wreck it, buy a new one
Your crew run-run-run, your crew run-run
I know you sick of this, name brand nigga with
Flows, girls say he's sweet like licorice
So, get with this nigga, it's easy (Uh-huh)
Girlfriend, here's a pen, call me round ten
Come through, have sex on rugs that's Persian (That's right)
Come up to your job, hit you while you workin'
For certain, Poppa freakin', not speakin'
Leave that ass leakin', like rapper demo
Tell them ho take they clothes off slowly (Slowly)
Hit 'em with the force like Obi (Obi)
Dick black like Toby (Toby)
Watch me roam like Romey (Romey)
Lucky they don't owe me
Where the safe? Show me, homie (Say what, homie)

Biggie, Biggie, Biggie, can't you see?
Sometimes your words just hypnotize me
And I just love your flashy ways
Guess that's why they broke, and you're so paid
Biggie, Biggie, Biggie, can't you see? (Uh-huh)
Sometimes your words just hypnotize me (Hypnotize)
And I just love your flashy ways (Uh-huh)
Guess that's why they broke, and you're so paid

Ten Crack Commandments,Life After Death,1997,"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

It's the ten crack commandments, what?
Nigga can't tell me nothing about this coke
Can't tell me nothing about this crack, this weed, for my hustlin' niggas
Niggas on the corner I ain't forget you niggas, my triple beam niggas

I've been in this game for years, it made me a animal
There's rules to this shit, I wrote me a manual
A step-by-step booklet for you to get
Your game on track, not your wig pushed back
Rule Number Uno: never let no one know
How much dough you hold cause you know
The cheddar breed jealousy 'specially
If that man fucked up, get yo' ass stuck up
Number 2: never let 'em know your next move
Don't you know Bad Boys move in silence and violence?
Take it from your highness (Uh huh)
I done squeezed mad clips at these cats for they bricks and chips
Number 3: never trust nobody
Your moms'll set that ass up, properly gassed up
Hoodied and masked up, shit, for that fast buck
She be laying in the bushes to light that ass up
Number 4: I know you heard this before
""Never get high on your own supply""
Number 5: never sell no crack where you rest at
I don't care if they want an ounce, tell 'em ""bounce!""
Number 6: that goddamn credit? Dead it
You think a crackhead paying you back, shit forget it!
7: this rule is so underrated
Keep your family and business completely separated
Money and blood don't mix like two dicks and no bitch
Find yourself in serious shit
Number 8: never keep no weight on you
Them cats that squeeze your guns can hold jums too
Number 9 shoulda been Number 1 to me:
If you ain't gettin' bagged stay the fuck from police
If niggas think you snitchin' they ain't tryna listen
They be sittin' in your kitchen, waiting to start hittin'
Number 10: a strong word called ""consignment""
Strictly for live men, not for freshmen
If you ain't got the clientele, say ""hell no!""
Cause they gon' want they money rain, sleet, hail, snow
Follow these rules you'll have mad bread to break up
If not, 24 years on the wake up
Slug hit your temple, watch your frame shake up
Caretaker did your makeup, when you passed
Your girl fucked my man Jacob
Heard in three weeks she sniffed a whole half a cake up
Heard she suck a good dick, and can cook a steak up
Gotta go gotta go, more pies to bake up, word up (Uh)

Armed and dangerous
Ain't too many can bang with us
Straight up weed, no angel dust
Label us notorious
Thug-ass niggas that love to bust, it's strange to us
Y'all niggas be scramblin', gamblin'
Up in restaurants with mandolins and violins
We just sittin' here tryna win, try not to sin
High off weed and lots of gin
So much smoke, need oxygen
Steadily countin' them Benjamins
Nigga, you should too, if you knew
What this game'll do to you
Been in this shit since '92
Look at all the bullshit I been through
So-called beef with you-know-who
Fucked a few female stars or two
Then I blew like nigga move like Mike
Shit, not to be fucked with
Motherfucker better duck quick
'Cause me and my dogs love to buck shit
Fuck the luck shit, strictly aim
No aspirations to quit the game
Spit yo game, talk yo shit
Grab yo gat, call yo clique
Squeeze yo' clip, hit the right one
Pass that weed, I got to light one
All them niggas, I got to fight one
All them hoes, I got to like one
Our situation is a tight one
What you gonna do: fight or run?
Seems to me that you'll take B
Bone and Big, nigga, die slowly
I'ma tell you like a nigga told me
""Cash Rule Everything Around Me""
Shit, lyrically niggas can't see me
Fuck it, buy the coke, cook the coke, cut it
Know the bitch 'fore you caught yourself lovin' it
Nigga with a Benz fuckin' it
Doesn't it seem odd to you?
Big come through with mobs and crews
Goodfellas down to the Mo' Thugs dudes
Who's the killer: me or you?

We forgive you, for you know not what you do

7 A.M. woke in the morning
With Hen' and caffeine and green and nicotine
No-Doz so pop a couple of those
Lil' RIPsta, nigga Mista Clean, make it gleam
Deep in my temple and not to get sentimentally steamed
With my instrumelody, and heated, especially for your team
And a .45 indeed will beam
In between the scenes, destroy your dreams
You willin' to die? We'll see
How many flee when I cause the scene?
We mean mug, 
Mo' Thugs
, trained to be perfect disciples
When it's survival, tongue is a double-edged sword
Triple six rivals spittin' fire
This the real truth, bitch, breakin' out for lies
My Messiah's better be ready for Armageddon, shit's expired
It's wild, bless the child, the one that became a man
Put in positions off in the Clair
All that I had to do was stare
Test me now, contender; never 
no surrender
, no pretend
Pick up my pen in my hand
One of my trusted friend-friends
Hey, open it, let's see if for real, we all suited
Beg my pardon to Martin: baby, we ain't marchin', we shootin'
In daily recruitin', there's a thug born everyday in the ghetto
We start 'em off little, we give 'em a bible
And a pen and a pad to hit the label—kick it, nigga!

Nigga roll with Bone up into the dank spot
To the dome with a shot of burb
Never get tossed to the curb
Be feelin' that urge to splurge
But I'm broke as fuck, Sin, give me that Mossberg swerve!
Up into my bag 'cause I gotta get my mask and shells
To put in this 12 gauge sawed-off
Get 'em hauled off,
 nigga, y'all loss
Take it all off, got a nigga caught off
But the Bone, not 
Leatherface
Too many are thinkin' they thugs
And little Mo Hart want to pull it and bust it
And bitch, if you steppin', we buckin' them guns, that's fucked up
Now let me get done with the grime
Gotta go purchase a dime
Put in a state to get done with the crime
Smokin' the reefer to ease my mind
Swig some wine, step on the block with the rocks
But really we be servin' them dummies, see?
Gotta buck him on down
If he come back talkin' like, ""Give me back me money!""
Thuggin' with me killers
Need us a liter of liquor but niggas ain't got shit
With a sawed-off pump, chrome .38 pistol
Now who ready to get bent?
Nigga like me fiendin' for them green leaves
But I ain't had no dough
Gotta make some money
So I'm makin' my dummy rocks if I go broke

It's Bone and Biggie, Biggie
It's Bone and Biggie, Biggie (we gon' rock the party)

Yeah, Little Lay, hey, comin' in the form of scripture
Finna get ya and hit ya with magic
Droppin' down lead but I call it my gadgets
With an automatic status, we spray
Time to load the Glocks, but I'm thinkin' not
There's another evil force tellin' me to do what I gotta do
So I up my pipe, a nigga dyin' tonight
And I'm always runnin' from the boys in blue
Biggie, blue's on my ass
Now I pull out the cellular phone to call Bone, ""What's happenin'?""
Grab artillery, a nigga start packin'
'Cause a motherfucker tried to get me in a jackin'
And I did him, hit him right between the eyes
The spot was wise; wanna test a nigga size, it'll cost him
Nigga fuck around with the wrong shit
Y'all get mo murdered all day, all day
We done paved the way and I'm on the run
I'ma call my boys and bring all the guns
Y'all niggas wanna have a little fun with number one, one, one?

Mo’ Money Mo’ Problems,Life After Death,1997,"Now, who's hot, who not?
Tell me who rock, who sell out in the stores?
You tell me who flopped, who copped the blue drop?
Whose jewels got rocks?
Who's mostly Dolce down to the tube sock?
The same old pimp, Mase
You know ain't nothing change but my limp
Can't stop till I see my name on a blimp
Guarantee a million sales, call it love or luck
You don't believe in Harlem World, nigga, double up
We don't play around, it's a bet, lay it down
Niggas didn't know me '91, bet they know me now
I'm the young Harlem nigga with the Goldie sound
Can't no Ph.D. niggas hold me down
Cudda schooled me to the game, now I know my duty
Stay humble, stay low, blow like Hootie
True pimp niggas spend no dough on the booty
And then you yell, ""There go Mase!"", there go your cutie

I don't know what they want from me
It's like the more money we come across
The more problems we see

I'm the D to the A to the D-D-Y
Know you'd rather see me die than to see me fly
I call all the shots, rip all the spots
Rock all the rocks, cop all the drops
I know you thinking now, ""When all the ballin' stops?""
Nigga never home, gotta call me on the yacht
Ten years from now we'll still be on top
Yo, I thought I told you that we won't stop
Now what you gon' do with a crew
That got money much longer than yours
And a team much stronger than yours?
Violate me, this'll be your day, we don't play
Mess around, be D.O.A., be on your way
‘Cause it ain't enough time here
Ain't enough lime here for you to shine here
Deal with many women but treat dimes fair
And I'm bigger than the city lights down in Times Square
Yea, yea, yea

I don't know what they want from me
It's like the more money we come across
The more problems we see

B-I-G P-O-P-P-A
No info for the DEA
Federal agents mad ‘cause I'm flagrant
Tap my cell and the phone in the basement
My team supreme, stay clean
Triple beam lyrical dream, I be that
Cat you see at all events bent
Gats in holsters, girls on shoulders
Playboy, I told ya, mere mics to me
Bruise too much, I lose too much
Step on stage, the girls boo too much
I guess it's ‘cause you run with lame dudes too much
Me lose my touch? Never that!
If I did, ain't no problem to get the gat
Where the true players at? Throw your Rolies in the sky
Wave 'em side to side and keep your hands high
While I give your girl the eye, player please
Lyrically, niggas see B.I.G be flossin’
Jig on the cover of Fortune, 5-double-O
Here's my phone number, your man ain't got to know
I got the dough, got the flow down pizat
Platinum plus like thizat
Dangerous on trizacks, leave your ass flizat

Sky’s The Limit,Life After Death,1997,"Baby, look at me, Mama love you
And I know you ain't no little boy no more
But you'll always be my baby
It seems like only yesterday I was holding you in my arms
Now look at you now big, but I worry about you
I worry about you all the time, hangin' out on the corner
All times at night with the cruel people
Baby, that ain't nothin' but trouble
I always taught you that you could have whatever you dream
Well, I want you to hold on to that dream, baby
Hold on to it real tight, ‘cause the sky's the limit

Good evening, ladies and gentlemen
How's everybody doing tonight?
I'd like to welcome to the stage
The lyrically acclaimed
I like this young man, because when he came out
He came out with the phrase
He went from ashy to classy – I like that
So everybody in the house
Give a warm round of applause for The Notorious B.I.G
The Notorious B.I.G
Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for him y'all!

Uh, a nigga never been as broke as me, I like that
When I was young, I had two pair of Lees, besides that
The pin stripes and the gray
The one I wore on Mondays and Wednesdays
While niggas flirt, I'm sewing tigers on my shirts, and alligators
You want to see the inside? I see you later
Here comes the drama, oh
That's that nigga with the fake, blaow
Why you punch me in my face? Stay in your place
Play your position, here come my intuition
Go in this nigga pocket, rob him while his friends watchin'
And hoes clockin', here comes respect
His crew's your crew or they might be next
Look at their man eye, big man, they never try
So we rolled with them, stole with them
I mean loyalty, niggas bought me milks at lunch
The milks was chocolate, the cookies, butter crunch
'88 Oshkosh and blue and white dunks, 
pass the blunts

Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressing on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, be what you want
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressing on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, be what you want
Have what you want, be what you want

I was ashamed, my crew was lame
I had enough heart for most of them
Long as I got stuff from most of them
It's on, even when I was wrong, I got my point across
They depicted me the boss, of course
My orange box-cutter make the world go round
Plus I'm fucking, bitches ain't my homegirls now
Start stacking, dabbled in crack, gun packing
Nickname Medina make the seniors tote my ninas
From gym class to Inglés pass off a global
The only nigga with a mobile, can't you see like Total
Getting larger in waists and tastes
Ain't no telling where this felon is headin', just in case
Keep a shell at the tip of your melon, clear the space
Your brain was a terrible thing to waste
'88 on gates, snatch initial name plates
Smokin' spliffs with niggas, real-life beginner killers
Praying God forgive us for being sinners, help us out

Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressing on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, be what you want
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressing on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, be what you want
Have what you want, be what you want

After realizin', to master enterprisin'
I ain't have to be in school by ten
I then began to encounter with my counterparts
On how to burn the block apart
Break it down into sections,
 
drugs by the selections
Some use pipes, others use injections
Syringe sold separately,
 
Frank the Deputy
Quick to grab my Smith & Wesson like my dick was missing
To protect my position, my corner, my lair
While we out here, say the Hustlers Prayer:
""If the game shakes me or breaks me
I hope it makes me a better man, take a better stand""
Put money in my mom's hand
Get my daughter this college plan so she don't need no man
Stay far from timid, only make moves when your heart's in it
And live the phrase ""Sky's the limit""
Motherfuckers, see you chumps on top

Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressing on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, be what you want
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressing on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, be what you want
Have what you want, be what you want
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressing on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, be what you want
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressing on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, be what you want
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on",https://genius.com/The-notorious-big-skys-the-limit-lyrics
I Got a Story to Tell,Life After Death,1997,"Who y'all talkin' to, man?
Uhh, check it out, check it out
This, here, goes out to all the niggas
That be fuckin' mad bitches
In other niggas cribs
Thinkin' shit is sweet
Nigga creep up on your ass, hahaha
Live niggas respect it—check it

I kicked flows for ya, kicked down doors for ya
Even left all my motherfuckin' hoes for ya
Niggas think Frankie pussy-whipped
Nigga, picture that, with a Kodak, Insta-ma-tac
We don't get down like that
Lay my game down quite flat
Sweetness, where you parked at?
Petiteness, but that ass fat
She got a body make a nigga wanna eat that
I'm fuckin' with you
The bitch official, though, dick harder than a missile, yo
Try to hit, if she trippin', disappearin' like Arsenio
Yo, the bitch push a double-oh
With the five in front, probably a conniving stunt
Y'all drive in front, I'ma peel with her
Find the deal with her, she fuck around and steal, huh?
Then we all get laced
Televisions, Versace heaven, when I'm up in 'em
The shit she kicked, all the shit's legit
She get dick from a player off the New York Knicks
Nigga tricked ridiculous, the shit was plush
She's stressing me to fuck, like she was in a rush
We fucked in his bed, quite dangerous
I'm in his ass while he playing 'gainst the Utah Jazz
My 112, CD blast, I was past
She came twice, I came last, roll the grass
She giggle, saying ""I'm smoking on home-grown""
Then I heard the moan, ""Honey, I'm home!""
Yep, tote chrome for situations like this
I'm up in his broad, I know he won't like this
Now I'm like, ""Bitch, you better talk to him
Before this fifth put a spark to him
Fuck around, shit get dark to him, put a part through him
Lose a major part to him—arm, leg...""
She beggin' me to stop but this cat gettin' closer
Gettin' hot like a toaster, I cocks the toast, ugh
Before my eyes could blink
She screams out, ""Honey, bring me up somethin' to drink!""
He go back downstairs, more time to think
Her brain racing, she's telling me to stay patient
She don't know I'm cool as a fan
Gat in hand, I don't wanna blast her man
But I can and I will, though; I'm tryna chill though
Even though situation looking kinda ill, yo
It came to me like a song I wrote
Told the bitch, ""Gimme your scarf, pillowcase, and rope""
Got dressed quick, tied the scarf around my face
Roped the bitch up, gagged her mouth with the pillowcase
Play the cut, nigga coming off some Love Potion shit
Flash the heat on 'em, he stood emotionless
Dropped the glass screaming, ""Don't blast, here's the stash!
A hundred cash! Just don't shoot my ass, please!""
Nigga pulling mad Gs out the floor
Put stacks in a Prada knapsack, hit the door
Grab the keys to the five, call my niggas on the cell
""Bring some weed, I got a story to tell"", uhh...

Yo man, y'all niggas ain't gonna believe what the fuck happened to me. Remember that bitch I left the club with man? Yo, freaky yo. I'm up in this bitch playa this bitch fuckin' run them ol' Knick ass niggas and shit. I'm up in the spot, so. I don't know, I don't know. One of them six-five niggas, I don't know. Anyway, I'm up in the motherfuckin' spot. So boom I'm up in the pussy, whatever whatever. I sparks up some lah, Pop Duke creeps up in on some, must have been rained out or something  because he's in the spot. Had me scared, had me scared to death, I was shook, Daddy—but I forget I had my Roscoe on me. Always. You know how we do. So anyway the nigga comes up the stairs, he creepin' up the steps, the bitch all shook she sends the nigga back downstairs to get some drinks and shit. She gettin' mad nervous, I said fuck that man! I'm the nigga, you know how we do it, nigga, ransom note style put the scarf around my motherfuckin' face. Gagged that bitch up, played the kizzack. Soon this nigga comes up in the spot, flash the Desert in his face he drops the glass. Looked like the nigga pissed on his-self or somethin, word to mother! Ahh fuck it. This nigga runs dead to the floor, peels up the carpet, start givin' me mad papers, mad papers. (I told you that bitch was a sheisty bitch cuz! Word to mother I used to fuck her cousin' but you ain't know that! You wouldn't know that shit. Really though.) I threw all that motherfuckin' money up in the Prada knapsack. Two words, I'm gone!

On the celly-celly with my homeboy Lance
Pass hash from left to right
Only got five blunts left to light, I'm set tonight
Met a bitch at the Versace store
Said she suck it 'til I ain't got no more, only in L.A
Bust on bitches be-lly, rub it in they tummy
Lick it, say it's yummy, then fuck your man

Almost gold, five Gs a show date
Or do you wanna see about seven digits?

Niggas Bleed,Life After Death,1997,"""Today's agenda (Woo!), got the suitcase up in the Sentra (Ugh)
Go to room 112, tell 'em Blanco sent ya
Feel the strangest if no money exchanges (Uh-huh)
I got these kids in Ranges to leave them niggas brainless (Ugh)
All they tote is stainless, you just remain as
Calm as possible, make the deal go through
If not, here's 12 shots, we know how you do
Please make your killings clean, slugs up in between
They eyes like True Lies, kill 'em and flee the scene
Just bring back the coke or the cream, or else (Ugh)
Your life is on the shelf, we mean this, Frank
Them cats we fucking with put bombs in your mom's gas tank""
""Let's get this money baby (Ugh), they shady, we get shady
Dress up like ladies and burn 'em with dirty .380s (Ugh, ugh)
Then they come to kill our babies, that's all out
I got gats that blow the wall out
Clear them all out, fuck the fallout
Word to Stretch, I bet they pussy
The seven digits push me (Ugh)
Fucking real, here's the deal (Ugh)
I got a hundred bricks, 14-5 apiece (Uh-huh)
Enough to cop a 6, buy the house on the beach (Uh-huh)
Supply the peeps with Jeeps, brick apiece, capisce?
Everybody getting cream, no one considered a leech
Think about it now, that's damn near 1.5
I kill 'em all, I'll be set for life""—""Frank, pay attention
These motherfuckers is henchmen (Ugh), renegades
If you die, they still get paid, extra probably; fuck a robbery
I'm the boss, promise you won't rob 'em""—""I promise""
But, of course, you know I had my fingers crossed

(Niggas bleed just like us) Picture me being scared
Of a nigga that breathe the same air as me
(Niggas bleed just like us) Picture me being shook
We can both pull burners, make the motherfucking beef cook
(Niggas bleed just like us) Picture a nigga hiding
My life in that man's hands while he just deciding
(Niggas bleed just like us) I'd rather go toe-to-toe
With all of y'all; running ain't in my protocol (Ugh!)

Since it's on, I call my nigga Arizona Ron
From Tucson, push the black Yukon
Usually had the slow grooves on, mostly rock the Isley (Uh-huh)
Stupid as a youngin', chose not to move wisely (Ugh)
Sharper with game, him and his crooks caught a jux
Heard it was sweet, about 350 apiece
Ron bought a truck, two bricks laid in the cut
His peeps got bucked, got locked the fuck up
That's when Ron vanished, came back speaking Spanish
Lavish habits, two rings, twenty carats
Here's a criminal, nigga made America's Most
Killed his baby mother brother, slit his throat
The nigga got bagged with the toast
Weeded, took it to trial, beat it
Now, he feel he undefeated, he mean it
""Nothing to lose"" tattooed around his gun wounds
""Everything to gain"" embedded in his brain
And me? I feel the same—for this money, you dying
Especially if my daughter crying, I ain't lying
Y'all know the science

(Niggas bleed just like us) Picture me being scared
Of a nigga that breathe the same air as me
(Niggas bleed just like us) Picture me being shook
We can both pull burners, make the motherfucking beef cook
(Niggas bleed just like us) Picture a nigga hiding
My life in that man's hands while he just deciding
(Niggas bleed just like us) I'd rather go toe-to-toe
With all of y'all; running ain't in my protocol (Ugh)

We agreed—to go in shooting is silly
Because niggas could be hiding in showers with MAC-millis
So I freaked 'em, the telly manager was Puerto Rican (Ugh)
Gloria from Astoria, I went to war with her peeps in '91
Stole a gun from my workers
And they took drugs, they tried to jerk us
We blazed they place; long story, Glo' seen't my face
Got shook, thought a nigga was coming for the safe (Haha!)
Now she breaking, ""Shut up! 112, what's shaking?""
""A Jamaican, some bitches, I swear they look gay
And a black Range Rover been outside all day""
If it's trouble, let me know, I'll be on my way
""Please, I got kids to feed, I done seen you make niggas bleed""
Nightmare, this bitch don't need
""Ron, get the gasoline, this spot, we about to blow this
Get the cash before the cops and Range Rover cats notice""
Room 112, right by the staircase, perfect place
When they evacuate, they meet they fate
""Ron, pass the gasoline,"" the nigga passed me kerosene (Ugh)
Fuck it, it's flame-able, my hunger is unexplainable
Strike the match, just what I expected
The dread kid ejected in seconds, and here come two...
Opposite sexes, one black, one Malaysian
We in the hallway, waiting patient
As soon as she hit the door, we start blasting
I saw her brains hit the floor, Ron laughing, I swear to God
I hit Maxi Priest at least twelve times in the chest
Spinned around, shot the chink in the breast (Ugh)
She crying, headshots put her to rest
Pop open them briefcases, nothing but Franklin faces
The spot's hot: sprinklers, alarm systems
That's when other guests start to slip in
It's time for us to get to dipping
I know them niggas in the Range is on they way up
Flipping, pistol-gripping, I load the clip in
The hallway got real loud and crowded
They walked right past us, I don't know how they allowed it
The funny thing about it, through all the excitement (Uh-huh)
They Range got towed, they double-parked by a hydrant
Stupid motherfuckers (Hahahahahaha!)",https://genius.com/The-notorious-big-niggas-bleed-lyrics
Long Kiss Goodnight,Life After Death,1997,"Mmmmmmmmm-HMM
See.. 
I told you.. 
See, I told y'all muh'fuckers
Yo yo.. that stupid nigga man
I told y'all to stop!
He fucked up, yo..
I pray for you to stop
Yo, yo yo yo, yo.. yo.. yo..
Yo, yo yo yo, yo..
But no, you didn't stop
Yo.. yo..
And now, we won't stop

Time, time for you to die
As I kiss.. yo'.. ass.. goodnight

I make your mouthpiece obese like Della Reese
When I release you lose teeth like Lil' Cease
Nigga please, blood floods your dungarees
And that's just the half of my warpath
Laugh now cry later
, I rhyme greater
Than the average playa hater and spectators
Buy my CD twice, they see me in the streets
They be like, ""Yo he nice, but that's on the low though""
Be the cats with no dough, tried to play me at my show
I pull out .44s and go up in they clothes
Short-change niggas, snort 'caine niggas
Extortion came quicker, bought the Range nigga
Ya still tickle me, I used to be as strong as Ripple be
'Til Lil' Cease crippled me
Now I play hard like my girl's nipples be
The game sour like a pickle be, 
y'all know the rules
Move from BK to New Jeruz
Thinkin' 'bout all the planes we flew, bitches we ran through
Now the year's new, I lay my game flat
I want my spot back, take two
Motherfuckers mad 'cause I blew, niggas envious
Too many niggas on my dick, shit's strenuous
When my men bust, you just move with such stamina
Slugs missed ya, I ain't mad at cha (we ain't mad at cha)
Blood rushin', concussions ain't nothin'
Catch cases, come out fronting, smokin' something
Sippin' White Russians, bitch in the Benz bumpin'
I laced it with the basic, six TVs a system
Knockin' Ma$e shit, face it, we hard to hit
Guard ya shit, 'fore I stick you for your re-up
Wipe the pee up, 
lick shots, woke your seed up
Go in the ashtray, spark the weed up, long kiss

Hell, we don’t give a fuck
We just absolutely don’t give a fuck
Because there ain’t no love here
There ain’t no love here
You know, we gon' keep doin' what we do
We gon' keep fuckin' you up
I'ma keep stomping your motherfucking head in
You fucking bitch

Time, time for you to die
As I kiss.. yo'.. ass.. goodnight
Time, time for you to die
As I kiss.. yo'.. ass.. goodnight

Uhh.. I'm flamin' gats, 
aimin' at
These fuckin' maniacs, put my name in raps
What part the game is that? Like they hustle backwards
I smoke Backwoods and Dutchies, you can't touch me
Try to rush me, slugs go, touchy-touchy
You're bleedin' lovely, with yo' spirit above me
Or beneath me, your whole life you live sneaky
Now you rest eternally sleepy, 
you burn when you creep me
Rest where the worms and the weak be
My nine flies, baptize rap guys
With the Holy Ghost, I put holes in most
You hold your toast shaky, slippin' tryna break me
Look what you made me do, brains blew
My team in the marine-blue Six Coupé
Skied it out, weeded out, cleanin' out
The block for distances, givin' long kisses, bitch

Only I can do now, I say a prayer for you
You know, that’s the only thing I can do, just pray for your mind
Because, see your mind is in control of your heart
Where it's supposed to be the other way around
Your heart has got to control your mind
So now, I have no feelings for you
You have made me cruel

Time, time for you to die
As I kiss.. yo'.. ass.. goodnight
Time, time for you to die
As I kiss.. yo'.. ass.. goodnight

Frank White the menacin', Chron Chron's the medicine
I got the lettuce and you turn green like cucumber skin
Got the new Hummer in the summer when
I was a newcomer then, drugs and MAC-10s
Hugs from fake friends, make ends they hate you
Be broke, girls won't date you
That's why I relate to, choke your ass out 'til your face blue
Make you, open the safe too
No matter how you call it (how you call it), this brolic alcoholic
Like his weed greened out, like his brick solid
Distribute to kids who take heart like Valentine
Drink Ballantine all the time
Slugs hit your chest, tap your spine, flatline
Heard through the grapevine, you got fucked four times
Damn that three to nine, fucked you up for real though
Sling steel slow, 
as for remorse, we feel no

Time, time for you to die
As I kiss.. yo'.. ass.. goodnight
Time, time for you to die
As I kiss.. yo'.. ass.. goodnight
Time, time for you to die
As I kiss.. yo'.. ass.. goodnight

See the fucked up thing is that I love you
You know what I’m saying
It’s just in my nature to love you
I can’t hate you
‘Cause its not in my nature to hate you
You know, I don’t know
Maybe I’m a different type of individual
But you have me on a line
And there’s a thin line between love and hate
And God-forbid I cross that line
Cause I’m not gon’ give a fuck
I’m telling you right motherfucking now
The shit that ya’ll done started
Is never gonna stop!
We are never gonna stop!
And we’re not talking about no other rappers
We’re talking about you, motherfucker!
You know who I’m talking to
We comin' for you
We comin' for you

I will fear no evil, for you are with me
Your rod and your staff, they comfort me

You anoint my head with oil, my cup overflows
Surely goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life
And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever

Niggas in my faction don't like askin' questions

Run up in your crib, wrap you in your Polo sheets
Six up in your wig-piece, nigga decease
Muah, may you rest in peace
With my Sycamore style, more sicker than yours
Four-four and fifty-four draw
As my pilot, steers my Lear; yes, my dear
Shit's official, only the Feds I fear
Here's a tissue, stop your bloodclaat cryin'
The kids, the dog, everybody dyin', no lyin'
So don't you get suspicious
I'm Big Dangerous, you're just a Lil Vicious

Climb the ladder to success escalator style
Hold y'all breath, I told y'all
Death controls y'all, Big don't fold y'all, uhh

, I'm the hip-hop version of Nicky Tarantino
Ask Nino, he know
Green with envy, the green tempts me
To make the rich the enemy, and take their cheese
Take their spots, take their keys, make my faculty
Live happily ever after in laughter
Hah, never seen Cristal pour faster
And to those bastards, knuckleheads squeeze lead
Three of mine dead, nothin' left to do
But tear they ass to shreds, leave 'em in bloodshed
Incidents like this, I take trips
Lay up in Miami with Tamika and Tammy (huh)
Some Creole C-O bitches I met on tour
Push a peach Legend Coupe, gold teeth galore
Told me meet 'em in the future later
They'll take me shoppin', buy me lavender and fuschia Gators
Introduce me to playa haters and heavy weighters
Rich bitch shit, drinkin' Cristal 'til they piss the shit, uhh
Thorough bitches, adapt to any borough bitches
Be in spots where they were no bitches, you feel me
Reminisce on dead friends too
You're nobody 'til somebody kills you

You're nobody 'til somebody kills you
(I don't wanna die, God tell me why)
You're nobody, 'til somebody, kills you
(I don't wanna die, God tell me why)
You're nobody 'til somebody kills you
(I don't wanna die, God tell me why)
You're nobody, 'til somebody, kills you
(I don't wanna die, God tell me why)

Uhh, uhh
You can be the shit, flash the fattest five (that's right)
Have the biggest dick, but when your shell get hit
You ain't worth spit, just a memory
Remember he used to push the champagne Range (I 'member that)
Silly cat, wore suede in the rain
Swear he put the G in game, had the Gucci frame
Before Dana Dane, thought he ran with Kane
I can't recall his name (what was his name?), you mean that kid
That nearly lost half his brain over two bricks of cocaine?
Gettin' his dick sucked by Crackhead Lorraine?
A fuckin' shame, duke's a lame, what's his name?
Dark-skin Jermaine, see what I mean?

You're nobody 'til somebody kills you
(I don't wanna die, God tell me why)
You're nobody, 'til somebody, kills you
(I don't wanna die, God tell me why)
You're nobody 'til somebody kills you
(I don't wanna die, God tell me why)
You're nobody, 'til somebody, kills you

Chills up that spine, that ass is mine
Skip the wine and the candlelight, no Cristal tonight
If it's all right with you, we fucking (that's cool)
Déjà vu, the blunts sparked, finger fucking in the park
Pissy off Bacardi Dark
Remember when I used to play between your legs?
You begged for me to stop because you know where it would head
Straight to your mother's bed
Not the Marriott, we be lucky if we find a spot
Next to your sister, damn I really missed the
Way she used to rub my back, when I hit that
Way she used to giggle when your ass would wiggle
Now I know you're used to suites at the Parker Meridien
Trips to the Caribbean, but tonight, no ends

All because you like the way my Benz was rimmed up
Bitch keep yo' chin up, please watch me do thee
Nasty, like it when you make it move fast mami

No love making, strictly back breaking
Cease know, all his hoes, go to my door
Then they go to his flo', to fuck some more

Somebody’s Gotta Die,Life After Death,1997,"Ah, ah!
I'm sittin' in the crib dreamin' about Lear jets and coupes
The way Salt shoops and how to sell records like Snoop (oops!)
I'm interrupted by a doorbell
3:52 - who the hell is this?
I gets up quick, cocks my shit
Stop the dogs from barkin', then proceed to walkin'
It's a face that I seen before
My nigga Sing, we used to sling on the 16th floor
Check it!
I look deeper; I see blood up on his sneakers
And his fist gripped a chrome four-fifth
So I dip
Nigga, is you creepin' or speakin'?
He tells me C-Rock just got hit up at the Beacon
I opens up the door, pitiful: ""Is he in critical?""
Retaliation for this one won't be minimal
'Cause I'm a criminal
Way before the rap shit
Bust the gat shit; Puff won't even know what happened
If it's done smoothly, silencers on the Uzi
Stash in the hooptie, my alibi: any cutie
With a booty that done fuck Big Pop
Head spinnin', reminiscin' 'bout my man C-Rock

Somebody gotta die
If I go, you got to go
Somebody got to die
Let the gunshots blow
Somebody got to die
Nobody got to know
That I killed yo' ass in the mist, bitch
Somebody got to die
If I go, you got to go
Somebody gotta die
Let the gunshots blow
Somebody got to die
Nobody got to know
That I killed yo' ass in the mist, bitch

Uhh, fillin' clips, he explained our situation
Precisely, so we know exactly what we facin'
""Some kid named Jason
In a Honda station wagon
Was braggin', about how much loot and crack he stackin'
Rock had a grip so they formed up a clique
A small crew, 'round the time I was locked up with you""
""True indeed""
""But yo nigga, let me proceed
Don't fill them clips too high
Give them bullets room to breathe
Damn, where was I? Yeah
Went outta town, blew the fuck up
D-Roc went home
And Jay got stuck the fuck up
Hit him twice, caught him right for the Persian white
Pistol whipped his kids and taped up his wife (niggas is trife)
He figured Rock set 'em up, no question
Wet 'em up no less
Than 50 shots in his direction"" (uhh)
""How many shots?""
""Man nigga, I seen mad holes""
""What kinda gats?""
""Hitchlinks, Kochs, and Calicos""
But fuck that
I know where all them niggas rest at
In the buildin' hustlin'
And they don't be strapped
Supreme in black is downstairs, the engine runnin'
Find a bag to put the guns in
And c'mon if you're comin'

Somebody gotta die
If I go, you got to go
Somebody got to die
Let the gunshots blow
Somebody got to die
Nobody got to know
That I killed yo' ass in the mist, bitch
Somebody got to die
If I go, you got to go
Somebody gotta die
Let the gunshots blow
Somebody got to die
Nobody got to know
That I killed yo' ass in the mist, bitch

Exchanged hugs and pounds before the throw down
How it's gon' go down?
Lay these niggas low-down
""Slow down, ah, fuck all that plannin' shit
Run up in they cribs and make the cats abandon ship!""
See niggas like you do ten-year bids
Miss the nigga they want and murder innocent kids
Not I
One nigga's in my eye, that's Jason
Ain't no slugs gonna be wasted
Revenge I'm tastin' at the tip of my lips
I can't wait to fill my clip in his hips
""Pass the chocolate, Thai!""
Sing ain't lie
There's Jason with his back to me
Talkin' to his faculty
I start to get a funny feeling
Put the mask on in case this nigga start squealin'
Scream his name out: (""Ay yo, playboy!"")
Squeezed six, nothin' shorter
Nigga turned around holdin' his daughter",https://genius.com/The-notorious-big-somebodys-gotta-die-lyrics
I Love the Dough,Life After Death,1997,"Uhh, uhh
Uhh, uhh, uhh, uhh, what
Hah, what, how real is this?
Uhh, uhh, how real is this?
What? Uhh, what?
Uhh

We push the hottest V's, peel fast
Through the city, 
play Monopoly with real cash
Me and Biggie and the models be shakin' they sadiddy ass
And Prada be somethin' you cats got to see
And the watches be all types and shapes of stones
Bein' broke is childish and I'm quite grown
Run up in the club with the ice on, me and Paisan
Scope the spot out, see somethin' nice and I'm gone
You cats is home screamin' the fight's on
I'm in the fifteen hundred seats, watchin' Tyson
Same night, same fight
But one of us cats ain't playin' right, I let you tell it
People place yourselves in the shoes of two felons
And tell me you won't ball every chance you get
And any chance you hit, we live for the moment
Makes sense, don't it? Now make dollars
Cats pop bottles,
 
bone chicks that favor Idalis
And rack up frequent flight mileage

Gotta let it show, I love the dough, hey
I love the dough, more than you know
Gotta let it show, I love the dough, hey

I'm poppin' Magnums while Jigga bag somethin'
Watch is platinum, got jet lag from
Flights back and forth, pop corks of the best grapes
Make the best CDs and the best tapes
Don't forget the vinyl
, 
take girls break spinals
Biggie be Richie like Lionel, shit
You seen the Jesús, dipped to H classes
Ice project off lights, chick flashes
Blind your broke asses, even got rocks in the beards and mustaches
Rock top fashions
Ain't shit changed,
 
'cept the number after the dot on the Range
Way niggas look at me now, kinda strange
I hate y'all too
Rather be in Caribbean sands with Rachel
It's unreal, out the blue Frank White got sex appeal
Bitches used to go, ""Ewww!""
Still tote steel, I'm tryin' to see five mil off the single, for real
You ain't fazin' the amazin'
While your gun's raisin', mine is blazin'
See you want see me all talkin' to sweetness
Take it for weakness and leave quick
Blocka, Roc-A-Fella, Bad Boy collabo
Two MCs with mad dough, you know

I love the dough, more than you know
Gotta let it show, I love the dough, hey (I love the dough)
I love the dough, more than you know (gonna let it show)
Gotta let it show, I love the dough, hey

Miraculous, pockets stay full
Niggas skip the bull 'cause we matadors
Snatch the P89s that we pack in the drawers
And we, clap the doors of your Acuras
Snap like, cameras on amateurs
Make you all dance, hold a hammer to yours
Jig and Big rock ice, no cracks or flaws
Everybody got a part to play, back to yours
Run up in your crib now, crack your doors
Watch the real players live, it's a habit to floss
Play the charts like The Beatles,
 y'all adapt you lost
And toast Cristal on behalf of y'all
Too bad for y'all
Ain't too many as bad as yours truly
Do we, we laugh at y'all
Little bastards y'all

Uhh, uhh
We hit makers with acres
Roll shakers in Vegas, you can't break us
Lost chips on Lakers, gassed off Shaq
Country house, tennis courts on horseback
Ridin', decidin' cracked crab or lobster
Who say mobsters don't prosper?
Niggas is actors, niggas deserve Oscars
Me I'm, critically acclaimed, slug pass your brain
Reminisce on dames whose coochie used to stink
When we rocked house pieces and puffy Gucci links
Now we buy homes in unfamiliar places
Tito smile every time he see our faces
Cases catch more than outfielders
Half these rappin' cats ain't seen war
Couldn't score if they had point game, they lame
Speak my name, I make 'em Dash like Dame
(We love the dough...)

I love the dough, more than you know (gonna let it show)
Gotta let it show, I love the dough, hey
I love the dough, more than you know (gonna let it show)
Gotta let it show, I love the dough, hey
I love the dough, more than you know (ah yeah)
Gotta let it show, I love the dough, hey

Uhh, I dream filthy
My moms and pops mixed me with Jamaican Rum and Whiskey
Huh, what a set off
Shoulda pushed him dead off, wipe the sweat off (uhh)
'Cause in this world I'm dead off, squeeze lead off
Benz sped off, ain't no shook hands in Brook-land
Army fatigues bring fatigue, to enemies, look man
You wanna see me locked up, shot up
Moms crouched up over the casket, screamin' ""BASTARD!""
Cryin', know my friends is lyin'
Y'all know who killed him, filled him with the lugers from they Rugers
Or they Desert, dyin' ain't the shit, but it's pleasant
Kinda quiet, watch my niggas bring the riot
Givin' cats the opposite of diets
You gain thirty pounds when you die no lie, lazy eye
I was high when they hit me, took a few cats with me
Shit, I need the company (uh-huh)
Apologies in order, to T'Yanna my daughter
If it was up to me you would be with me
Sorta like Daddy Dearest, my vision be the clearest
Silencers so you can't hear it
Competition still fear it, shit don't ask me
I went from ashy to nasty to classy, and still

Fifty dollar half-a-men, daydreamin'
Fuck around get wet like semen, your whole team and
Be more gone than Freeman
I took the cream and, moved to new places, new faces
Fuck the screw faces, 'cause when I flip
I make the papers, dangerous, we Goodfellas
Niggas can't bang with us, try to do me
My crew be unruly (what)
Some old school cats that call gats toolies
Call blacks moolies, think it's cool to smoke woolies
And fuck without rubbers (what)
Specialize in killin' wives and grandmothers
Who ya trustin', shit
When Frank start bustin', Frank start somethin'
Killin' ya gently, God meant me, to push a Bentley

Fifty shots'll tear your club apart
Eatin' shrimp À la carte, with some bitches from Brussels
Eatin' clams and mussels

Give her a package to push, 'cause I work them hoes
Pendejos I show you how to play them hoes

The motherfuckin shit just get me so motherfuckin' mad
‘Cause, you know, that was my nigga, you know
And like, I had just got the nigga Puff card and shit (yeah)
I knew the shit was 'bout to go down
And my man was like hyping me
'Bout everywhere we go, me and O (pluggin' it)
Me and O be together, and the nigga be like
""Watch, I'm telling you when my man get on, it's gonna be some shit, we ain't gonna have to sell this shit no mo'

And the nigga just got moked out like that, man (tch)

Yo, man, I loved that nigga O too (say word)
That was my motherfuckin' heart

Yeah, dedicating this to my nigga O
We miss you, nigga
Going out to all the young niggas that died in the struggle
Word up, shit is real in the field
You know, sparkin' blunts to all you niggas; word up

Each and every day
Daydreams of how we used to be
See your family
And that baby's lookin' just like you
Why'd you go away?
I've been missin' you lately
Tell me what you're going through, oh yeah

Uhh, uhh
I remember sellin' three bricks of straight flour
Got my man a beat down to the third power
He didn't care, spent the money in a half hour
Got some fishscale, reigned on competition like a shower
Got the coke cooked up, a crackhead Kevin
In '88, when Kane ruled with ""Half Steppin'""
A .38, a lot of mouth was our only weapon
We was kings 'til the D's crept in
And now I'm missin' him

Ooh, I'm missin' you (I'm missin' you)
Tell me why the road turns, why it turns
Ooh, I'm missin' you (missin' you)
Nah nah nah nah nah
Oh tell me why why why why

Uhh, we work all week, weekends we play the movies
We rocked flattops, our girls rocked doobies
Made a killin', even though the D's knew me
Eventually, you know they try to do me
Fuck it! Fed up, my nigga wanted to take it down South
Sick of cops coming, sick of throwing jacks in his mouth
Gave him half my paper, told 'em ""Go that route!""
Few months, he got his brain blown out, now I'm stressed
His baby's mother, she trippin', blamin' me
And his older brothers understand the game it be
Kinda topsy-turvy; you win some, you lose some
Damn, they lost a brother, they mother lost a son
Fuck, why my nigga couldn't stay in N.Y.?
I'm a thug, but I swear for three days I cried
I, look in the sky and ask God why
Can't look his baby girls in the eye
Damn, I'm missin' him

Ooh, I'm missin' you (I'm missin' you)
Tell me why the road turns, why it turns
(Tell me, tell me why)
Ooh, I'm missin' you (I'm missin' you)
Nah nah nah nah nah
Oh tell me why why
(Tell me, tell me why) why why

There was this girl around the way that made cats drool
Her name's Drew, played fools out they money in pool
People swore we was fuckin', but we was just cool
She used to hang while I slang my joints after school
She'd watch my bomb, help my moms with the groceries
My little sister, the girl was kinda close to me
A little closer than the average girl's supposed to be
Far from a lover, my girl was jealous of her
Then she started messin' with some major players
Handled keys, niggas called them the Bricklayers
A dread kid, had a baby 'fore that bitch Taya
Found out her baby's father cheating
Now Drew, she gotta slay her
One night, across from the corner store
Taya ran around the block with a chrome four-four
Squeezed all six shots in the passenger door
The dude lived – what my baby had to die for?
I'm missin' her

Ooh, I'm missin' you (I'm missin' you)
Tell me why the road turns, why it turns
(Tell me, tell me why, ooh)
Ooh, I'm missin' you (I'm missin' you)
Nah nah nah nah nah
Oh tell me why why why why (oh God tell me why)
Ooh, I'm missin' you (tell me, tell me why)
Tell me why the road turns, why it turns (ooh ooh)
Ooh, I'm missin' you (missin' you)
Nah nah nah nah nah
Oh tell me why why why why

Then come big blunts with big chunks of hash

Pimp so hard a nigga drag his mink on the floor
Won't you admit it? I ain't gotta talk because I live it
Any chick fuckin' with me, believe me, that's a privilege
I won't be satisfied til all my niggas get it

And Big be that nigga, we be flyin' through your hood
And hood rats scopin' with their eyes on my goods
See, we date 'em like we hate 'em, see 'em like we don't need 'em
Treat 'em like we beat 'em, and never give up freedom

She ain't no sucker, I know that bitch, man
She wanna be a Pretty Woman lovin' a rich man
Now here you come, drop top ridin'
You ain't no pimp, fake nigga, stop lyin'
Pussy makes money, stick to the business
Think about the real motherfuckers that lived it
Street life, pimp shit, make the ho respect the game
You bought her diamonds and cars, trick, that's a shame
Say what you want, but I still figure
She left you 'cause you couldn't be like them real niggas
She was a hustler by nature and you was just faker
Than the average simps, found a badder pimp

Crazy ass man
I never would have bought that bitch all them cars
And all that shit you bought that hoe, man
After I heard about what the bitch did nigga, knew the hoe!
Man I'm 30 years old, nigga
And that bitch was hoein' when I was in 9th grade and shit
Think about that: she been around then right?
Shit, you just a rest haven for hoes, man
Just the first nigga that came along when the bitch got out the pen
Bitch only fuckin' with you cause you had a good ass job, nigga
Nerd...treat the bitch better than anybody ever treated her
Stupid ass nigga, she ain't nothin' but a hoe!
Bet you fell in love with her man!
You can't turn a hoe into a housewife, fool
Every time you turn your back, that bitch is fuckin' with them gangstas
Eastside, Westside - these are my partners
Do that shit, you know what I'm talkin' 'bout nigga
I tell you about some real pimps and hoes
Tell you about these pimps and these hoes man
Yeah I know a few, shit

Fuck you too
Fuck you bitch
Fuck you motherfucker

You wasn't sayin' that when you was suckin' my dick
You wasn't sayin that when you was eatin' my pussy
You nasty bitch
You a nasty motherfucker
Check it, uhh

What do ya do when yo' bitch is untrue
You cut the hooker off and find someone new
I need another bitch (another bitch), in my life

Uh-huh, uhh, uhh
I know he don't treat you like I treat you
Time to explain your game is see-through
Sex is lethal, I ain't gon' lie
Means to get ya back, I ain't gon' try
Like this y'all, my girl sucked another nigga dick y'all
Light skinned with the chromed out six y'all
Thought they was creepin', took trips to V-A every third weekend
While you was sleepin', he hit you on the box
Sixty-nine code non-stop
Shoulda left ya then, but my heart said not
You knew too much, the relationship grew too much
You knew about the crack vials, means to be trial
Where I hid dough under the bathroom tile
Waited for a while, thought you was my right thing
Then things got frightenin'
Peep the scene, sorta like Sam Rothstein
Guess you Ginger, huh, go figure
Never thought you could be a gold-digger
Take my dough and spend with the next nigga
Asked my man Jigga, my ace boon coon
Told me cut the bitch off 'fore the shit balloon
Now I'm like Brandy, Sittin' in My Room
Pissy drunk listenin' to Stylistics tunes
Or the O'Jays, thinkin' 'bout the old days
My nigga's like, fuck that bitch, go play
Baller, when she beep you, don't call her
Guess who I seen, that freak bitch Paula
She was askin' 'bout ya whereabouts
Here's the digits, I know you can wear that out
Tear that out the frame, ya game so tight
We'll be all fuckin' tonight, knahmean?!
(I'm fuckin' you toniiight..) feel me? Uhh

What do ya do when your man is untrue
Do you cut the sucker off and find someone new
I need another man, in my life

Mmm, uhhh, uhhh!
'Member when you said you would die for me, shit
All of that was just lies to me
Motherfucker shoulda never said bye to me
Now you cry for me, like Jodeci
It's like that y'all, my nigga hit another bitch from the back y'all
Black nasty and mad fat y'all; shoulda seen the ho
Nigga pack your shit, you out the do', ohh
What about the fight in The Mirage?
I seen ya Benz parked outside my sister's garage
Said it was your friend Rog, bullshit
I ain't gonna keep puttin' up wit the bullshit
And still I, never sweat these bitches
Q.B. hang like plaques on the wall in your pictures
Scale them fishes, my love is concrete
Stashin' your heat in the passenger seat of the Nautica Jeep
We've been down for so long
Still a bitch like me tryin' to hold on
Teary eyed, damn a bitch steamin'
Girls steady screamin', ""Kim you need to leave him!""
When I testified in court
Couldn't think straight thinkin' 'bout the bitches I fought
Over you, nigga have the shit you bought
And fuck you, movin' is my last resort
You see, nine outta ten niggas ain't shit
One outta five niggas suck a dick
You're mad at me, too bad she ain't as bad as me
Shoulda kept the freak bitch off my canapé
Now you see, ain't no pussy warm as mine
Long as mine, ain't no love as strong as this
When I sucked your dick, it's like smokin' a roach
Uhh, why go from first class to coach

What do ya do when yo' bitch is untrue
You cut the hooker off and find someone new
I need another bitch (another bitch), in my life

What do ya do when your man is untrue
Do you cut the sucker off and find someone new
I need another man, in my life

What do ya do when yo' bitch is untrue

This goes out to my Brooklyn crew
Representin' on the freaky freaky
Fuck 'em all day, fuck 'em all night
We don't love these hoes

I go on and on and on and
Don't take them to the crib unless they bonin'
Easy, call 'em on the phone and
Platinum Chanel cologne and
I stay, dressed to impress
Spark these bitches interest
Sex is all I expect
If they watch TV in the Lex, they know
They know, quarter past 4
Left the club tipsy, say no mo'
Except how I'm gettin' home tomorrow
Caesar drop you off when he see his P.O
Back of my mind I hope she swallow
Man she spilled a drink on my cream Wallows
Reach the gate, hungry just ate
Riffin', she got to be to work by eight
This must mean she ain't tryna wait
Conversate, sex on the first date
I state, ""You know what you do to me""
She starts off, ""Well I don't usually""
Then I whipped it out
, rubber no doubt
Step out, show me what you all about
Fingers in your mouth, open up your blouse
Pull your G-string down South
Threw that back out, in the parkin' lot
By a Cherokee and a green drop-top
And I don't stop, until I squirt
Jeans, skirt, butt-naked, it all work

You nasty boy, you nasty
You nasty boy, you nasty
You nasty boy, you nasty
You nasty boy, nigga you so nasty
You nasty boy, you nasty
You nasty boy, you nasty
You nasty boy, you nasty
You nasty boy, nigga you so nasty

I remember we went to Tennessee
Then we came home, mad messages was on my phone
Bitch named Simone
Screamin, 
she fiendin' for the semen
Me bein' the man that I am
Took it to her condo pronto
Half Indian, I called her Tonto
Roll the chron' chron' in the dark pronto
Few puffs, eyes got low
And off to the bedroom we go
Sex is drama, head is trauma
Ripped pajamas, I'ma stay 'til tomorrow
Satisfyin' all my needs twice
With whipped cream, handcuffs and ice
The bitch is nice, word is bond
Can't wait to put my niggas on, what? What?

You nasty boy, you nasty
You nasty boy, you nasty
You nasty boy, you nasty
You nasty boy, nigga you so nasty
You nasty boy, you nasty
You nasty boy, you nasty
You nasty boy, you nasty
You nasty boy, nigga you so nasty

Ladies, my Mercedes
Hold fo' in the back, two if you're fat
Keep a gat 'cause cats try fi test me
They just fans like De Niro, Wesley
Let's see, the bitch I'm waitin' on
Gardeur jeans look like they painted on
Ask thee, leave it up to me
Lay her on back ever so gently
She like the way the dough fold up, Rolls roll up
Cristal 'til she throw up, bitch grow up
Hold up, there's DeGenero
Dripped out, Iceberg apparel
Intro goes without speaking
Call me Cease 'cause I keep 'em, we can go freakin'
All weekend, so, roll in
Ain't it good that my Lex seats foldin'? Uhh

Last Day,Life After Death,1997,"Can I live 'til my last day?
Hittin' honies that be na-sty
Gettin' money in the fast way
And I only care halfway
But I still can't let you pass me

Yo what's beef to you, three niggas with hoodies and bats
That ain't shit compared to one small cat with gats
When we came here we cut off all kind circulation
Breathin', eatin', the whole situation
When we do our shit we do our shit for real
While you take your money for your deal and make your own beats
Compose your own sheets, that's aight but chill
I'ma spend that mil and cop only hot shit
Rock top shit you know how The LOX get
Then you can see me flyin' in the Bentley cockpit
LOX and B-I, hold our grica down for years
Gang not, but we been had our black tears
Niggas under the stairs only understand what we got
Underground, all above must get shot
You couldn't book me Dano, Sheek Luciano put the burners
To all y'all, what nigga bring it I'm callin' y'all

You already know what it's about when I run up in your house
Put the gun up in your mouth and get the money out the couch
Hearin' you out is senseless, perhaps for instance
I give this faggot a french kiss
Black gloves, no prints, dark tints
Word on the street they ain't heard from him since
You know about life after kickin' the kid in
Since me and my mi-dan can flip seven gri-dams
Scri-dam, the flow is forbidden
Either you ridin' or you dyin' 'cause we swingin' iron
LOX and Poppa, turning niggas into Jim Hoffa
Who gon' stop us? Your last joint double copper
You gettin' money or your runnin' from the Feds
Ain't nothin' over here but 16 with one in the head
And I solemnly swear
That all y'all niggas out there got a problem this year

Can I live 'til my last day?
Hittin' honies that be na-sty
Gettin' money in the fast way
And I only care halfway
But I still can't let you pass me
Can I live 'til my last day?
Hittin' honies that be na-sty
Gettin' money in the fast way
And I only care halfway
But I still can't let you pass me

Before you think of keepin' me down, heatin' me down
The flow like water get deep and you drown
With no soul, many niggas roll with no goal
Even the small gun got a little black hole
Your destiny is something you can never figure out
Niggas is never happy 'til there's blood up in your mouth
There's a lot of killers, but who the hell are you to blame
There's a lot of dead, how the hell you take the pain?
Live with it got money you better give with it
My man had the thug in him did his bid with it
Get married to the game but never have a kid with it
Advice from the wise, slice the pies
Too many schemes devised when dreams collide
Teams provide war for the street to absorb
You stashed in the ceiling and you slept on the floor
Only a blind thug'll fall in love with a whore

Uhh, uhh, uhh

Who the fuck wanna squeeze?
My Desert E's make MC's freeze
You wakin' up in cold sweats, they just dreams
You still apologizin'
Analyzin', my size and your size and
Realizin', a fist fight would be asinine
You just pop wines, I must pop nines
Genuine steel piece, nozzle in your grill piece
You're shook up, two bricks, every cook up
We can hook up, all I see is the future
Disrespect, 
I shoot ya
By the way, them bricks get flipped weekly
Sold by soldiers that mix weed with the leak leak
Die for a dollar, nigga, life ain't sweet
Play for keeps, wet shirts with experts on the creep
Our beef is my fiancé, about to marry it
Illegal transactions in Farragut with Arabics
Why not, they fit twelve up in the bedroom
Imagine what they stash is like, 
make you a classic like
My first LP,
 beef with me is unhealthy
Fuck around and get an ulcer, loose your pulse or
Collapsed lung, look how many gats I brung
For them homos, still doin' promos
Break both your legs you're movin' slow-mo
Got shine to glow mo'
Nine hundred and ninety six grams, you need four mo'

Can I live 'til my last day?
Hittin' honies that be na-sty
Gettin' money in the fast way
And I only care halfway
But I still can't let you pass me
Can I live 'til my last day?
Hittin' honies that be na-sty
Gettin' money in the fast way
And I only care halfway
But I still can't let you pass me
Can I live 'til my last day?
Hittin' honies that be na-sty
Gettin' money in the fast way
And I only care halfway

The motherfuckin' dust kicker, who can you trust?
Do you have the heart to see a nigga, before you bust?
My name is spoken on the tongues of so many foes
Bustin' motherfuckers out the box, I ain't even go
Now how the hell do you explain my claim to fame?
From doin' flicks to bustin' tricks out the fuckin' frame
Got these bitches on my jock, niggas on my block
Jealous ass suckers got 'em duckin' from my smokin' Glock
And bustin' niggas asses to stay alive
Skinny ass player watchin' bigger motherfuckers fry
They ask me how I'm livin', I'm a hustler
Buckin' busters 'til they die
Now it's on in the ghetto, you ain't heard?
Niggas got they AKs headin' for them 'burbs
Aimin' at them skinhead bitches, let it rain
Givin' 'em a wet welcome to the house of pain

""In a city that's upset by the challenge of racial tension at many levels, where the level of violence is higher this year than last""
""Our city is a war zone""

Yo, I'm hunting down this nigga and he know so he stressin'
He better count his blessings and get ready for this lesson
The Stretch 'bout to teach him when I reach him with the MAC
And lay that ass down on his motherfucking back, Jack
Slack is something that a nigga don't take
His moms run the church, so I'ma see her at his fucking wake
Make way, the nigga paid me the other day
I'm walking with my son and the nigga got somethin' to say
Hey! The nigga tried to diss, boy, he got it twisted
He shoulda watched America's Most, I'm listed
For killing motherfuckers like him
So I'ma bring him to the House of Pain and kill him with a grin
Flim flam, god damn, I'm not the one
Before I choke him and smoke him
I'm gonna smack him with my fuckin' gun
Son, you made your last mistake and I don't know your name
But welcome to the House of Pain

""In the second such case in recent memory, a Bronx woman being charged with murder in the shooting death of her daughter over her crack habit""

(Coughing) Huh, the country bud got me chokin'
I'm on a mission to the point that motherfuckers think I'm smokin'
Yeah, that sick nigga Biggie with the 8-shot fifth
With the extra clip for that extra shit
Don't you know that a killing is thrilling?
All the blood spilling, is all a part of drug dealing
A born gangsta, my daddy was a thug
Had a .38 with the hollow-point slug
So when he licked shots, niggas dropped
Quicker than a bootlegger sells his liquor
A little nigga tryna squeeze .22's in my Reebok shoes
Payin' dues, while kids was on they one's and two's
Huh, now I'm much older, colder, fuck a holster
Got the MAC-11 swingin' from my shoulder
It's a damn shame I got to put my momma through this strain
I'm livin' in the house of pain

Into flamin' 'em, like that little nigga Damien
Pop 19 to my motherfuckin' cranium
Game tight, gun totin' motherfucker
Niggas in the grave thought Biggie was a sucker
I tricked 'em -- I gave 'em work then I sticked 'em
I stripped 'em, cause niggas don't want the friction
Told you before how I bring the drama
Slam Larry Johnson and his Grandmama
Whatchu want nigga?!

Whatchu want nigga, whatchu whatchu want nigga? (x8)

Fuck around and feel the fury of a high nigga
When I get busy, throw your hands to the sky nigga
I got the illest of the ill mentality, niggas be grabbing me
Knowing that they'd rather be stabbing me
All up in my back, trying to take my track
When I used to sell crack, I ain't have problems like that
Street rules, watch your pockets and your jewels
A nigga front? Throw the gat to the fools
Tears don't effect me, I hit 'em with the TEC, G
Disrespect me? My potency is deadly
Once the venom hits the cerebellum
My lips get chapped, and my hards start swellin'
Keep the nine millimeter by the Peter
To kill a motherfucker, don't a think feel sweeter
Oooohh, it make my head hurt, the blood spurt
The robbery expert's berserk

girls used to diss me
Now they write letters 'cause they miss me
I never thought it could happen, this rapping stuff
I was too used to packing gats and stuff
Now honeys play me close like butter play toast
From the Mississippi down to the East Coast
Condos in Queens,
 indo for weeks
Sold out seats to hear Biggie Smalls speak
Living life without fear
Puttin' five karats in my baby girl ear
Lunches, brunches,
 
interviews by the pool
Considered a fool 'cause I dropped out of high school
Stereotypes of a black male misunderstood

50-inch screen,

Got two rides, a limousine with a chauffeur
Phone bill about two G's flat
No need to worry, my accountant handles that
And my whole crew is loungin'

Now my mom pimps an Ac' with minks on her back
And she loves to show me off of course
Smiles every time my face is up in 
The Source
We used to fuss when the landlord dissed us
No heat, wonder why Christmas missed us
Birthdays was the worst days
Now we sip Champagne when we thirsty

To all the ladies in the place with style and grace
Allow me to lace these lyrical douches in your bushes
Who rock grooves and make moves with all the mamis?
The back of the club, sippin' Moët is where you'll find me
The back of the club, mackin' hoes, my crew's behind me
Mad question askin', blunt passin'
Music blastin', but I just can't quit
Because one of these honeys Biggie got to creep with
Sleep with, keep the ep a secret, why not?
Why blow up my spot 'cause we both got hot?
Now check it: I got more mack than Craig, and in the bed
Believe me, sweetie, I got enough to feed the needy
No need to be greedy, I got mad friends with Benzes
C-notes by the layers, true fuckin' players
Jump in the Rover and come over
Tell your friends jump in the GS3, 
I got the chronic by the tree

I love it when you call me Big Poppa
Throw your hands in the air if you's a true player
I love it when you call me Big Poppa
To the honies getting money
Playing niggas like dummies
I love it when you call me Big Poppa
You got a gun up in your waist
Please don't shoot up the place!
‘Cause I see some ladies tonight
That should be having my baby, baby

Straight up, honey, really I'm askin'
Most of these niggas think they be mackin', but they be actin'
Who they attractin' with that line
""What's your name? What's your sign?""
Soon as he buy that wine, I just creep up from behind
And ask you what your interests are, who you be with
Things that make you smile, what numbers to dial
You gon' be here for a while?
I'm gon' go call my crew, you go call your crew
We can rendezvous at the bar around 2
Plans to leave, throw the keys to Little Cease
Pull the truck up front, and roll up the next blunt
So we can steam on the way to the telly, go fill my belly
A T-bone steak, cheese eggs and Welch's grape
Conversate for a few, ‘cause in a few we gon' do
What we came to do, ain't that right, boo? (True)
Forget the telly—we just go to the crib
And watch a movie in the jacuzzi, smoke Ls while you do me

I love it when you call me Big Poppa
Throw your hands in the air if you's a true player
I love it when you call me Big Poppa
To the honies getting money
Playing niggas like dummies
I love it when you call me Big Poppa
If you got a gun up in your waist
Please don't shoot up the place!
‘Cause I see some ladies tonight
That should be having my baby, baby

(How you living, Biggie Smalls?) In mansion and Benzes
Givin' ends to my friends, and it feels stupendous
Tremendous cream: fuck a dollar and a dream
Still tote gats, strapped with infrared beams (What?)
Choppin' Os, smokin' la in Optimos
Money, hoes and clothes: all a nigga knows
A foolish pleasure? Whatever
I had to find the buried treasure, so grams I had to measure
However, living better now, Coogi sweater now
Drop top BM's, I'm the man, girlfriend

Yeah, honey, check it—
Tell your friends to get with my friends
And we can be friends
Shit, we can do this every weekend, aight?
Is that aight with you?
Yeah… keep bangin'

I love it when you call me Big Poppa
Throw your hands in the air if you's a true player
I love it when you call me Big Poppa

Aw shit, nigga! The fuck time is it, man?
Oh, God damn
Nigga, do you know what time it is?
Aw shit, what the fuck's goin' on?
You aight?
Ah, nigga, what the fuck is wrong with you?

When I die, fuck it, I wanna go to hell
'Cause I'm a piece of shit, it ain't hard to fuckin' tell (
What you talkin' 'bout, man?
)
It don't make sense, goin' to heaven with the goodie-goodies
Dressed in white, I like black Timbs and black hoodies (
Aw, man
)
God'll probably have me on some real strict shit
No sleepin' all day, no gettin' my dick licked
Hangin' with the goodie-goodies, loungin' in paradise
Fuck that shit, I wanna tote guns and shoot dice (
You talkin' some crazy shit now, nigga
)
All my life I been considered as the worst
Lyin' to my mother, even stealin' out her purse (
Ah
)
Crime after crime, from drugs to extortion
I know my mother wish she got a fuckin' abortion
She don't even love me like she did when I was younger (
Yo, get a hold of yourself, nigga
)
Suckin' on her chest just to stop my fuckin' hunger
I wonder; if I died, would tears come to her eyes?
Forgive me for my disrespect, forgive me for my lies (
You're buggin', B
)
My baby mother's eight months, her little sister's two
Who's to blame for both of them?
 
(
Nah, nigga, not you
)
I swear to God I want to just slit my wrists and end this bullshit
Throw the Magnum to my head, threaten to pull shit
 
(
Nigga, what the fuck?
)
And squeeze until the bed's completely red
 
(
It's too late for this shit, man
)
I'm glad I'm dead, a worthless fuckin' buddha head
The stress is buildin' up, I can't— I can't believe (
Ayo, I'm on my way over there, man
)
Suicide's on my fuckin' mind, I wanna leave
I swear to God I feel like death is fuckin' callin' me
But nah, you wouldn't understand
Nigga, talk to me please, man!
You see, it's kinda like the crack did to Pookie in 
New Jack
Except when I cross over, there ain't no comin' back
 
(
Ayo, ayo, man, I'm out
)
Should I die on the train track like Ramo in 
Beat Street
?
 
(
I'ma call you when I get in the car
)
People at the funeral frontin' like they miss me
 
(
Ayo, where your girl at, man?
)
My baby mama kiss me, but she glad I'm gone (
Yo, put your girl on the phone, nigga!
)
She know me and her sister had somethin' goin' on
I reach my peak, I can't speak (
Ayo, you listenin' to me, motherfucker?
)
Call my nigga Chic, tell him that my will is weak
 (
Ayo, c'mon, nigga
)
I'm sick of niggas lyin' (
Cut that
), I'm sick of bitches hawkin' (
Ayo
)
Matter of fact, I'm sick of talkin'

Turned him self in, he had to do a
 
bid
A one-to-three, he be home the end of '93
I'm ready to get this paper, G, you with me?
Motherfuckin' right, my pockets lookin' kinda tight
And I'm stressed
Yo, Biggie let me get the vest
No need for that, just grab the fuckin' gat
The first pocket that's fat, the TEC is to his back
Word is bond, I'ma smoke him, 
yo, don't fake no moves (What?)
Treat it like boxin', stick and move, stick and move
Nigga, you ain't got to explain shit
I've been robbin' motherfuckers since the slave ships
With the same clip and the same four-five
Two point blank, a motherfucker sure to die
That's my word, 
nigga even try to bogard
Have his mother singin', ""It's so hard""
Yes, love, love your fuckin' attitude
Because the nigga play pussy
That's the nigga that's gettin' screwed
And bruised up from the pistol whippin'
Welts on the neck from the necklace strippin'
Then I'm dippin' up the block and I'm robbin' bitches, too
Up the 
herringbones
 and 
bamboos
I wouldn't give a fuck if you're tnangerp
Give me the baby rings and the #1 Mom pendant
I'm slammin' niggas like Shaquille, shit is real
When it's time to eat a meal I rob and steal
'Cause mom duke ain't givin' me shit
So for the bread and butter, I leave niggas in the gutter
Huh, word to mother, 
I'm dangerous
Crazier than a bag of fuckin' angel dust
When I bust my gat, motherfuckers take dirt naps
I'm all that and a dime sack,
 where the paper at?

When he's stickin' you and takin' all of your money

Don't let me fill my clip up in ya back and headpiece
The opposite of peace, sendin' mom duke a wreath
You're talkin' to the robbery expert
Step into your wake with your blood on my shirt
Don't be a jerk and get smoked over bein' resistant
'Cause when I lick shots them shits is persistent
Goodness gracious, the papers
Where the cash at? Where the stash at?
Nigga, pass that
Before you get your grave dug from the main thug
Three fifty-seven slug
And my nigga Biggie got a itchy one grip
One in the chamber, thirty-two in the clip
Motherfuckers better strip, (Yeah, nigga, peel!)
Before you find out how blue steel feel
From the Beretta, puttin' all the holes in ya sweater
The money-getter, motherfuckers don't know better
Rolex watches
 
and colorful Swatches
I'm diggin' in pockets
, motherfuckers can't stop it
Man, niggas come through, I'm takin' high school rings too
Bitches get *********
 for their earrings and bangles
And when I rock her and drop her, I'm taking her door knockers
And if she's resistant: blakka, blakka, blakka
So go get your man, bitch, he can get robbed, too
Tell him Biggie took it, what the fuck he gonna do?

Man, I throw him in the fiend you grab the fucking cream
And if he start to scream, bom-bom, have a nice dream
Hold up, he got a fucking bitch in the car
Fur coats and diamonds, she think she a superstar
Ooh, Biggie let me jack her, I'll kick her in the back
Hit her with the gat
Yo, chill, shorty,
 
let me do that
Just get the fucking car keys and cruise up the block
The bitch act shocked getting shot on the spot
Oh shit, the cops
Be cool, fool
They ain't gonna roll up, all they want is fucking doughnuts
So why the fuck he keep looking?
I guess to get his life tooken
I just came home, ain't trying to see Central Booking
Oh shit, now he looking in my face
You better haul ass 'cause I ain't with no fucking chase
So lace up your boots, 'cause I'm about to shoot

Everyday Struggle,Ready to Die,1994,"I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knockin' at my front door
I'm livin' every day like a hustle, another drug to juggle
Another day, another struggle (Right)
I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knockin' at my front door
I'm livin' every day like a hustle, another drug to juggle
Another day, another struggle (Right)

I know how it feel to wake up fucked up
Pockets broke as hell, another rock to sell
People look at you like you's the user
Sellin' drugs to all the losers, mad buddha abuser
But they don't know about your stress-filled day
Baby on the way, mad bills to pay
That's why you drink Tanqueray, so you can reminisce
And wish you wasn't livin' so devilish, shit
I remember I was just like you
Smokin' blunts with my crew, flippin' over 62's
'Cause G-E-D wasn't B-I-G
I got P-A-I-D, that's why my moms hate me
She was forced to kick me out, no doubt
Then I figured out nicks went for 20s down South
Packed up my tools for my raw power move
Glock 19 for casket and flower moves
For chumps tryin' to stop my flow
And what they don't know will show on the autopsy
Went to see Papi to cop me a brick
Asked for some consignment, he wasn't tryin' to hear it
Smokin' mad Newports 'cause I'm due in court
For an assault that I caught in Bridgeport, New York
Catch me if you can like the Gingerbread Man
You better have your gat in hand, 'cause man

Sometimes I hear death knockin' at my front door
I'm livin' every day like a hustle, another drug to juggle
Another day, another struggle (Right)

I had the master plan, I'm in the caravan on my way to Maryland
With my man Two-TECs to take over this projects
They call him Two-TECs, he tote two TECs
And when he start to bust, he like to ask, ""Who's next?""
I got my honey on the Amtrak with the crack
In the crack of her ass, two pounds of hash in the stash
I wait for hon to make some quick cash
I told her she could be lieutenant, bitch got gassed
At last, I'm literally loungin', black
Sittin' back, countin' double digit thousand stacks
Had to re-up, see what's up with my peeps
Toyota deal-athon had it cheap on the Jeeps
See who got smoked, what rumors was spread
Last I heard I was dead, with six to the head
Then I got the phone call, it couldn't hit me harder
We got infiltrated, like Nino at the Carter
Heard TEC got murdered in a town I never heard of
By some bitch named Alberta over nickel-plated burners
And my bitch swear to God she won't snitch
I told her when she hit the bricks I'll make the hooker rich
Conspiracy, she'll be home in three
Until then I looks out for the whole family
A true G, that's me, blowin' like a bubble
In the everyday struggle

I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knockin' at my front door
I'm livin' every day like a hustle, another drug to juggle

I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knockin' at my front door
I'm livin' every day like a hustle, another drug to juggle
Another day, another struggle (Right)

I'm seein' body after body and our mayor Giuliani
Ain't tryin' to see no black man turn to John Gotti
My daughter use a potty so she's older now
Educated street knowledge, I'ma mold her now
Trick a little dough buyin' young girls fringes
Dealin' with the dope fiend binges, seein' syringes
In the veins, hard to explain how I maintain
The crack smoke make my brain feel so strange
Breakin' days on the set, no sweat
Drunk off Moët, can't bag yet because it's still wet
But when that dry, baggin' five at a time
I can clock about nine on the check cashin' line
I had the first and the third, rehearse, that's my word
Thick in the game, D's knew my first name
Should I quit? Shit no, even though they had me scared
Yo, they got a eight, I got a TEC with air holes

And that's just how the shit go in the struggle, motherfucker
Hah, come on, what you say?

I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knockin' at my front door
I'm livin' every day like a hustle, another drug to juggle
Another day, another struggle (Right)
I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knockin' at my front door
I'm livin' every day like a hustle, another drug to juggle

You actin' like you can't call me no more 'cause you busy and all of that
But you trying to tell me it wasn't good?

That shit is real fucked up what you did
I hooked you up with my girl and shit

I don't know what's going on, motherfuckers trying to rob me
You be disappearing and shit, I'm waiting in the cold
What the fuck is going on?
When you get in give me a fucking call, alright?

When it comes to sex, I'm similar to the Thrilla in Manila
Honeys call me ""Bigga the Condom Filler""
Whether it's stiff tongue or stiff dick
Biggie squeeze it to make shit fit, now check this shit
I got the pack of Rough Riders in the back of the Pathfinder
You know the epilogue by James Todd Smith
I get swift with the lyrical gift
Hit you with a dick, make your kidney shift
Here we go, here we go, but I'm not Domino
I got the funk flow to make your drawers drop slow
So recognize the dick size in these Karl Kani jeans
I wear thirteens, know what I mean?
I'll fuck around and hit you with the Hennessy dick
Mess around and go blind, don't get to see shit (See shit)
The next batter, here to shatter your bladder
It doesn't matter, skinny or fat or light-skinned or black
Baby, I drop these Boricua mamis screaming ¡Ay papi!
I love it when they call me Big Poppa
I only smoke blunts if they rolled proper
Look, I gotcha caught up with the drunk flow
Fuck tae kwon do, I tote a four-four
For niggas getting mad 'cause they bitch chose me
A big black motherfucker with G, you see
All I do is separate the game from the truth
Big bang boots from the Bronx to Bolivia
Getting physical like Olivia Newt
Tricks suck my clique dick all day with no trivia
So give me a ho, a bankroll and a bag of weed
I'm guaranteed to fuck her 'til her nose bleed
Even if your new man's a certified mack
You'll get that H-Town in ya, you want that old thing back

Oh, Biggie, give me one more chance
I got that good dick, girl, you didn't know?
Oh, Biggie, give me one more chance
I got that good dick, girl, you didn't know?
Oh, Biggie, give me one more chance
I got that good dick, girl, you didn't know?
Oh, Biggie, give me one more chance

Is my mind playing tricks, like Scarface and Bushwick
Willie D, having nightmares of girls killing me?
She mad because what we had didn't last
I'm glad because her cousin let me hit the ass
Fuck the past, let's dwell on the 500SL, the E&J and ginger ale
The way my pockets swell to the rims with Benjamins
Another honey's in the crib? Please, send her in
I fuck non-stop, lick my lips a lot
Used to lick the clits a lot, but licking clits had to stop
'Cause y'all don't know how to act when the tongue go down below
Peep the funk flow
Really, though, I got the cleanest, meanest penis
You never seen this stroke of genius
So take off your Timb boots and your body suit
I mean the spandex and hit my man next
Sex get rougher when it come to the nut buster
Pussy crusher, black nasty motherfucker
I don't chase 'em, I replace 'em
And if I'm caressing 'em I'm undressing 'em
Fuck what you heard, who's the best in New York?
Fulfilling fantasies without that nigga Mr. Roarke
Or Tattoo, I got you wrapped around my dick
And when I nut I got to split
Shit, backshots is my position
I got you wishing for an intermission, fuck the kissin'
Lickin' you down to your belly button, I ain't frontin'
They don't call me big for nuttin' all of a sudden

Oh, Biggie, give me one more chance
Oh, Biggie, give me one more chance
Oh, Biggie, give me one more chance
Oh, Biggie, give me one more chance",https://genius.com/The-notorious-big-one-more-chance-lyrics

Who the fuck is this, pagin' me at 5:46 in the morning?
Crack of dawn and now I'm yawnin'
Wipe the cold out my eye
See who's this pagin' me and why
It's my nigga, Pop from the barbershop
Told me he was in the gambling spot and heard the intricate plot
Of niggas wanna stick me like flypaper, neighbor
Slow down, love, please chill, drop the caper
Remember them niggas from the hill up in Brownsville
That you rolled dice with, smoked blunts and got nice with?
Yeah, my nigga Fame up in Prospect
Nah, them my niggas, nah, love, wouldn't disrespect
I didn't say them
They schooled me to some niggas that you knew from back when
When you was clockin' minor figures
Now they heard you're blowin' up like nitro
And they wanna stick the knife through your windpipe slow
So, thank Fame for warnin' me, 'cause now I'm warnin' you
I got the MAC, nigga, tell me what you gonna do

Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper
Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper
Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper

They heard about the Rolexes and the Lexus
With the Texas license plates out of state
They heard about the pounds you got down in Georgetown
And they heard you got half of Virginia locked down
They even heard about the crib
You bought your moms out in Florida, the Fifth Corridor
Call the coroner!
There's gonna be a lot of slow singin' and flower-bringin'
If my burglar alarm starts ringin'
What ya think all the guns is for?
All-purpose war
, 
got the Rottweilers by the door
And I feed 'em gunpowder so they can devour
The criminals tryin' to drop my decimals
Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my cream
And it ain't a dream
, things ain't always what it seem
It's the ones that smoke blunts with ya, see your picture
Now they wanna grab they guns and come and get ya
Bet ya Biggie won't slip
I got the Calico 
with the black talons loaded in the clip
So I can rip through the ligaments
Put the fuckers in a bad predicament
Where all the foul niggas went
Touch my cheddar, feel my Beretta
Buck what I'ma hit you with, you motherfuckers better duck
I bring pain, bloodstains on what remains
Of his jacket, he had a gun, he shoulda packed it
Cocked it, extra clips in my pocket
So I can reload and explode on your asshole
I fuck around and get hardcore
C-4 to your door, no beef no more, nigga
Feel the rough, scandalous
The more weed smoke I puff, the more dangerous
I don't give a fuck about you or your weak crew
What you gonna do when Big Poppa come for you?
I'm not runnin', nigga, I bust my gun and
Hold on, I hear somebody comin'

C'mon, motherfucker
Man, I'm comin' as fast as I can
Just g— bring your motherfuckin' ass on, come on
Are we gettin' close, huh?

Yo, would you kill for me?
Hmm, yeah
Uh, the act of making love— (Haa)
What took you so long to answer motherfucker?
I don't know
The fuck wrong with you, bitch?

When I met you, I admit, my first thoughts was to trick
You look so good, huh, I suck on your daddy's dick
I never felt that way in my life
It didn't take long before I made you my wife
Got no rings and shit, just my main squeeze
Comin' to the crib, even had a set a keys
During the days you helped me bag up my nickels
In the process, I admit, I tricked a little
But you was my bitch, the one who'd never snitch
Love me when I'm broke or when I'm filthy fuckin' rich
And I admit, when the time is right, the wine is right
I treat you right, you talk slick, I beat you right

Just me and my bitch, me and my bitch

Just me and my bitch

Moonlight strolls with the hoes, oh, no, that's not my steelo
I wanna bitch that like to play ceelo and craps
Packin' gats in a Coach bag, steamin' dime bags
A real bitch is all I want, all I ever had
With a bop just as strong as me
Totin' guns just as long as me, the bitch belongs with me
Any plans with another bitch, my bitch'll spoil it
One day, she used my toothbrush to clean the toilet
Throwin' my clothes out the windows, so when the wind blows
I see my Polos and Timbos
Hide my car keys so I can't leave
A real slick bitch, keep a trick up her sleeve
And if I deceive, she won't take it lightly
She'll invite me, politely, to fight, G
And then we lie together, cry together
I swear to God I hope we fuckin' die together

Just me and my bitch, just me and my bitch, yeah

Just me and my bitch, yeah, just me and my bitch
(Yo, don— don't play with my dick)

She helped me plan out my robberies on my enemies
Didn't hesitate to squeeze to get my life out of danger
One day, she put 911 on the pager
Had to call back, whether it's minor or major
No response, the phone just rung
Grab my vest, grab my gun, to find out the problem
When I pulled up, police was on the scene
Had to make the U-turn, make sure my shit was clean
Drove down the block, stashed the burner in the bushes
Stepped to police with the shoves and the pushes
It didn't take long before the tears start
I saw my bitch dead with the gunshot to the heart
And I know it was meant for me
I guess the niggas felt they had to kill the closest one to me
And when I find 'em your life is to an end
They killed my best friend, me and my bitch

Just me and my bitch, me and my bitch, yeah

So when did you first start rappin'?
Um, I was like about 18 years old. Yeah, about 18
So how did you first get started? Who influenced you?
Ain't nobody really influenced me, you know what I'm saying?

Like Arnold on that, ""What you talking 'bout, Willis?""
The thrill is gone,

Is here to excite and throw dick to dykes

Step inside the ring, you's the number one contender
Looking cold-booty like your pussy in December

From Method all you getting is a can of ass-whipping
Hey, I'll be kicking you son, you doing all the yapping
Acting as if it can't happen
Your frontin' got me mad enough to touch something
Yo, I'm from Shaolin Island and ain't afraid to bust something

Cold as the pole in the winter
Far from the inventor, but I got this rap shit sewed

I'm guaranteed another video
Ready to die, why I act that way?
Pop duke left mom duke, the faggot took the back way
So instead of making hoes suck my dick up
I used to do stick-ups, 'cause hoes is irritating like the hiccups
Excuse me, flows just grow through me
Like trees to branches, cliffs to avalanches

deep like the mind of Farrakhan

Machine Gun Funk,Ready to Die,1994,"Yeah

So you wanna be hardcore?
With your hat to the back
Talkin' about the gats in ya raps
But I can't feel that hardcore appeal that you're screamin'
Maybe I'm dreamin'
This ain't Christopher Williams
Still some MC's gotta feel one, caps I gotta peel some
To let niggas know that if you fuck with big-and-heavy
I get up in that ass like a wedgie
Says who? Says me, the lyrical
Niggas sayin', ""Biggie off the street, it's a miracle!""
Left the drugs alone, took the thugs along with me
Just for niggas actin' shifty
Sticks and stones break bones, but the gat'll kill ya quicker
Especially when I'm drunk off the liquor
Smokin' funk by the boxes, packin' Glocks-es
It's natural to eat you niggas like chocolates
The funk, baby

""I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk""
""I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk""
""I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk""
""I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk""
""I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk""
""I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk""
""I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk""
""I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk""

All I want is bitches, big-booty bitches
Used to sell crack so I could stack my riches
Now I pack gats to stop all the snitches
From stayin' in my business, what is this?
Relentless approach to know if I'm broke or not
Just 'cause I joke and smoke a lot
Don't mean I don't tote the Glock
Sixteen shots for my niggas in the pen
Until we motherfuckin' meet again, huh
I'm doin' rhymes now, fuck the crimes now
Come on the Ave, I'm real hard to find now
'Cause I'm knee-deep in the beats
In the Land Cruiser Jeep with the MAC-10 by the seats
For the jackers, the jealous-ass crackers in the (blue suits)
I'll make you prove that it's bulletproof
Hold your head 'cause when you hit the bricks
I got gin, mad blunts, and bitches suckin' dick
The funk, baby

""I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk""
""I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk""
""I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk""
""I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk""
""I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk""

So I guess you know the story, the rap-side, crack-side
How I smoke funk, smack bitches on the backside
Bed-Stuy, the place where my head rests
Fifty-shot clip if a nigga want test
The rocket launcher, Biggie stomped ya
High as a motherfuckin' helicopter
That's why I pack a Nina, fuck a misdemeanor
Beatin' motherfuckers like Ike beat Tina
""What's love got to do...""
When I'm rippin' all through your whole crew?
Strapped like Bamboo but I don't sling guns
I got bags of funk and it's sellin' by the tons
Niggas wanna know how I live the mack life
Makin' money, smokin' mics like crack pipes
It's type, simple and plain, to maintain
I add a little funk to the brain

Getting paid is all I expected

Shit is real and hungry's how I feel

With the neighborhood crews hanging on the avenues

Talk slick, you get your neck slit quick

Little motherfuckers with heat wanna leave a nigga six feet deep
And we coming to the wake
To make sure the crying and commotion ain't a motherfucking fake
Back in the days our parents used to take care of us
Look at 'em now, they even fuckin' scared of us
Calling the city for help because they can't maintain
Damn, shit done changed

Back in the day
Things done changed on this side
Remember they used to thump, but now they blast, right?

If I wasn't in the rap game
I'd probably have a ki, knee-deep in the crack game
Because the streets is a short stop
Either you're slingin' crack rock or you got a wicked jump shot
Shit, it's hard being young from the slums
Eatin' five cent gums, not knowing where your meal's coming from
And now the shit's getting crazier and major
Kids younger than me, they got the Sky brand pagers
Goin' out of town, blowing up
Six months later, all the dead bodies showing up
It make me wanna grab the nine and the shotty
But I gotta go identify the body
Damn, what happened to the summertime cookouts?
Every time I turn around, a nigga gettin' took out
Shit, my mama got cancer in her breast
Don't ask me why I'm motherfucking stressed, things done changed

Back in the day
Things done changed on this side
Remember they used to thump, but now they blast, right?

Respect,Ready to Die,1994,"[Intro: Diana King & 
The Notorious B.I.G.
]
No big up our gun men, seen? (
Big up, big up
)
Cuh dis ah '94 when ah RAA fi kill people and kyaan dun
Nuh waan pussy hole hold di kaanah
Watch this, lawd

Me holla respect, to all the gun men dem
Gun men alone, keep gun men friend
Fire bun, fi all the informer dem
Informer lone keep informer friend

1970 something, nigga I don't sweat the date
My moms is late so I had to plan my escape
Out the skins, in this world of fly girls
Tanqueray and Hennessy until I call hurl
Ten months in this gut, what the fuck?
I wish moms would hurry up so I could get buck
Wild juvenile ripping mics and shit
New York, New York, ready for the likes of this
Then came the worst date, May 21st
2:19, that's when my mama water burst
No spouse in the house so she rode for self
To the hospital, to see if she could get a little help
Umbilical cord's wrapped around my neck
I'm seeing my death and I ain't even took my first step
I made it out, I'm bringing mad joy
The doctor looked and said, ""He's going to be a bad boy""

Me holla respect, to all the gun men dem
Gun men alone, keep gun men friend
Fire bun, fi all the informer dem
Informer lone keep informer friend

Now I'm thirteen, smoking blunts, making cream
On the drug scene, fuck a football team
Risking ruptured spleens by the age of sixteen
Hearing the coach scream ain't my lifetime dream
I mean, I want to blow up, stack my dough up
So school I didn't show up, it fucked my flow up
Mom said that I should grow up and check myself
Before I wreck myself, disrespect myself
Put the drugs on the shelf? Nah, couldn't see it
Scarface, 
King of New York
, I want to be it
Rap was secondary, money was necessary
Until I got incarcerated, kinda scary
C74-Mark 8
 set me straight
Not able to move behind the great steel gate
Time to contemplate, damn, where did I fail?
All the money I stacked was all the money for bail

Me holla respect, to all the gun men dem
Gun men alone, keep gun men friend
Fire bun, fi all the informer dem
Informer lone keep informer friend
Me holla respect, to all the gun men dem
Gun men alone, keep gun men friend
Fire bun, fi all the informer dem
Informer lone keep informer friend

Ninety-four, now I explore new horizons
Mama smile when she see me, that's surprising
Honeys is tantalizing, they freak all night
Keep ducking cops on the creep all night
As I open my eyes and realizing I changed
Not the same deranged child stuck up in the game
And to my niggas living street life
Learn to treat life to the best, put stress to rest
Still tote your vest man, niggas be tripping
In the streets without a gat? Nah, nigga you're slipping
If I'm dipping on The F with weed on my breath
Original hustler with the muffler on the TEC
Respect to the macks in the Ac's
To the freaks in the Jeeps, lick shots to my peeps

Me holla respect, to all the gun men dem
Gun men alone, keep gun men friend
Fire bun, fi all the informer dem
Informer lone keep informer friend
Me holla respect, to all the gun men dem
Gun men alone, keep gun men friend
Fire bun, fi all the informer dem
Informer lone keep informer friend

Now this is Diana King doing a Yankee thing
In a Biggie Small's thing, do it, Ja
Have mercy!
The gunman in all de party
And everybody feel irie
And everybody just follow me, follow me, follow me

Just Playing (Dreams),Ready to Die,1994,"As I sit back relax, steam a blunt, sip a Becks
Think about the sexy singers that I wanna sex
I'd probably go to jail for fucking Patti LaBelle
Ooh, Regina Belle, she'd probably do me swell
Jasmine Guy was fly, Mariah Carey's kinda scary
Wait a minute, what about my honey Mary?
Them jeans, they fitting like a glove
I had a crush on you since Real Love, huh
Hold your horses
I'ma show you who the boss of intercourse is
Sex, I'm taking no losses
Even groups like SWV and TLC can't see B.I.G. with telepathy
The recipe, a pinch of hardcore with a gun
Pimpin' ain't easy, but it sure is fun
When I bust my nuts I bust 'em one by one
So what's the 4-1-1, hun?

Dreams of fuckin' an R&B bitch (I'm just playin', but I'm sayin')

I'll put Chanté Moore pussy in stitches
I'll fuck RuPaul before I fuck them ugly-ass Xscape bitches
You can 76 the 69, try 68
Make Raven-Symoné call date rape
Only 'cause I'm paid, I'm fucking all of Jade
And my DJ Zhané, she likes it when they say
""Everybody move your body""
Got Whitney Houston boosting from Bobby
As I bust the cherry of Monica and Terry
Back shots to Chaka, I know that pussy hairy
Sade, ooh, I know that pussy tight
Smack Tina Turner give her flashbacks of Ike
Smoke a stoge, fuckin' En Vogue because it's four of them
Jimmy hats for Patra, I'm using all of them
(What about Toni Braxton?)
If that bitch give me action, guaranteed satisfaction

Dreams of fuckin' an R&B bitch (I'm just playin', but I'm sayin')

Next thing you know, you fuckin' a bitch
You just pass around shit, pass the shit like a cold and shit
Fuck 'em

Now when I'm fucking off gin I'm invincible
Don't love no ho, that's my principle
'Cause, uh, bitches come (And uh) bitches go (Uh)
That's why I get my nut and I be out the fucking door (You know)
They might be the one to set me up
Want to get they little brother to wet me up
That's why I tote TECs and stuff, to get them off my case
Just in case the little fucker ends up misplaced
I don't give a bitch enough to catch the bus
And when I see the semen I'm leaving
Bitches be scheming, I kid you not
That's why I keep my windows locked and my Glock cocked
One ho said, Big, why you so hard on us?
Why you swear all bitches are so scandalous?
Thug nigga 'til the end, tell a friend, bitch
'Cause when I like you, then you go and fuck my friend, bitch
And you know that ain't right

You know that ain't right with a friend of mine
You know that ain't right with a friend of mine
You know that ain't right with a friend of mine
You know that ain't right with a friend of mine

You see, I don't sweat these hoes
I keep them in flavors like Timbos and Girbauds
Bitches just like to play the merry-go
Yeah we know, drop the scenario
It was me, Dee, the MPV
The blunts and brew thang, knocking some Wu-tang
M-E-T-H-Oh shit, look at them lips and them hips on that bitch
Dee hit the dip, so I can drop my mackadocious shit
Light the blunt clip and recognize a pimp
Needless to speak, the G's obsolete
Don't sleep, banged the skins in a week
On the creep up the avenue
I seen her on the block, who she rapping to?
That's my nigga Dee, damn he got G
Now she fucking him and fucking me, see
You know that ain't right

You know that ain't right with a friend of mine
You know that ain't right with a friend of mine
You know that ain't right with a friend of mine
You know that ain't right with a friend of mine, uh

Now I play her far like a moon play a star
She still sweat me hard 'cause I'm a rap star
I be cruising up the block, I be passing her
Pimping hard with a female passenger
And the only time I call her to hang
Is when me and Dee blunted up, pissy, scheming on a gangbang
She should have used her intuition
Then she wouldn't be classified in that position, listen
She's saying I dissed her 'cause I'm fucking her sister
A message to the fellas, that really gets 'em pissed, uh
But she started that fucking family
She fucked my man Dee, so why she mad at me? (True)
Plus your sister look better than you
Give head better than you, pussy get wetter than you
So break the fuck out like a rash
I'm glad I ain't spend no cash to hit your nasty ass

You know that ain't right with a friend of mine

The bitches ride the dick like the A-train
That's why I flip
Keep a burner to my hip
Take a hooker to the crib, you know she got to strip
Stay dipped, take out of state trips
Don't drink a lot of Hennessy, I only take a sip
I'm a skipper, like a captain, rappin' is my speciality
And the best is me

You're lucky I don't run you over in the SUV
And if you feel some kind of way you can S-M-D
Me, Fizzy and the King, that's a special three
Far as money, less you work, the less you see
Put hands on 'em, they just wanna S-U-E
You could never do what I can do unless you me
'Cause dog I'm a low cat
I bring that dope back
No matter how they feel about me, just let 'em know that

I got love for New York City, New York City
And they got love for me and B-I-G
They always gon' hold us down
We got that work in New York City
Where they be talkin' real fast, all about the cash

Don't drink a lot of Hennessy, I only take a sip
I'm a skipper, like a captain, rappin' is my speciality
And the best is me

Remember me and you smokin' in the Lexus Jeep
And you schoolin' me on how to bless these streets
Told me to, ""Get your money, Kiss, F these beefs""
Get your paperwork right and you can catch these thieves
The game is forever a part of me
'Cause as far as NYC, I'm the main artery
Nobody parallel or even half as smart as me
You was just a draft pick, I was a lottery
It's still love

I got love for New York City, New York City

Legacy,The King & I,2017,"Ummm, one of the most talked about parts of your life, your relationship with faith. How are things?
I mean, We ain't together no more, she just had a baby from me, we cool though, we tight

It's that Faith Evans right here
Biggie Smalls, hey Faith you ready? You ready?

Venue after venue, I been through
Come up to the telly so i could bend you
Send you to the store, condoms and more
Jealous females call you sluts and whores

Seems like yesterday we used to rock the show
I laced the beat, you locked the flow

Could it be my hardcore metaphor
Make sweat pour on the bedroom floor
Open up the Lex door
Jump on in, I'm kind of tired
I'm a roll blunts while you spin

You twist up while I whip the bourbon
You teach me while I'm steady learning like

You got your license, right? Alright, no swerving
Hair blonde out, Madonna style like a virgin
Niggas see the ring, baguettes to death
She looking for a man, honey he just left

And I knew..
I knew from the very first moment
That you were a king fit just for a queen
And I can tell from day one you were for me
Who know that this love be the legacy

And I'm so happy to say that I know you
My whole life was changed instantly
And I was willing to play my position, yeah
When you made my wife to be
You are here by my side
Through all the changes
We've been through everything
So far from strangers
You more like my best friend
My perfect angel
I rock you till the end
I love you till the end

I knew from the very first moment
That you were a king fit just for a queen
And I can tell from day one you were for me
Who know that this love be the legacy

Grand Marnier increase the don strength
Two four-fifths within my arms length
With a calm breath I say we gots to float
Throw Little Cease the keys to the boat
Tongue all down her throat, you know the routine
Got my dick large like Bruce Springsteen
I invite those girls that smoke lye
Keep it real with you
You keep it real with I
We be tight like frog's ass
Have you screaming ""Biggie, Biggie give me one more chance""

I knew from the very first moment
That you were a king fit just for a queen
And I can tell from day one you were for me
Who know that this love be the legacy

You are here by my side
Through all the changes
We've been through everything
So far from strangers
You more like my best friend
My perfect angel
I rock you till the end
I love you till the end

Sometimes I get caught up imagining
The way things could’ve been
And there’s no way that we can press rewind
We can’t go back we can’t turn back the time
No, no oh we can’t turn it
We can’t turn back the time
(No we can’t turn back the time)
We can’t turn back the time

You know, we gunna always be together ‘cause you know, we got a little story together",https://genius.com/Faith-evans-and-the-notorious-big-legacy-lyrics

It's the ten wife commandments
I wrote me a manual
A step-by-step booklet for you to get
It's the ten wife commandments

Don't hate the player
Just hate the game
You break the rules nigga, I'll do the same
What you gonna do when they come for you?
When they come for you?
This is gonna come back around
Don't hate the player

You break the rules nigga, I'll do the same
What you gonna do when they come for you?

The Notorious B.I.G
]
I've been in this game for years, it made me a animal
There's rules to this shit, I wrote me a manual
A step-by-step booklet for you to get
Your game on track, not your wig pushed back
Rule nombre uno:
 Never let no chick know
What you and your man do in the bedroom
Might feel good when you in it
And you probably want to admit it
But it ain't nobody business
Number two:
 Gotta be a pretty girl all the time 
(take it from your highness)
Gotta build him up and make him strong
You gotta be the only one he want
Number Three:
 Gotta be a lady in the street
And you gotta be a freak in the sheets
But don't do too much (don't do too much)
All my ladies singin' with me now

Don't hate the player
Just hate the game
You break the rules nigga, I'll do the same
What you gonna do when they come for you?
When they come for you?
This is gonna come back around
Don't hate the player
Just hate the game
You break the rules nigga, I'll do the same
What you gonna do when they come for you?
When they come for you?
This is gonna come back around
[Verse 2 : Faith Evans + 
The Notorious B.I.G
]
Number four:
 I know you heard this before
Tell him you love him before he step out the door
Number five:
 Gotta let him wear the pants
You be a lady and you let him be the man
Number six:
 Know how to put it down in the kitchen
When he bring it home you gotta have a good meal fixed
Seven, this rule is so underrated
: Gotta keep your feelings and your money separated
It's okay to let him have control
But girl, you gotta have your own
Do your own thing
Number eight:
 Gotta keep your head game straight
Number nine:
 Shoulda been number one to me
Gotta take care of the family
Number ten:
 Be careful of the people you meet
When you 'round in the streets, you better listen to me

Don't hate the player
Just hate the game
You break the rules nigga, I'll do the same
What you gonna do when they come for you?
When they come for you?
This is gonna come back around
Don't hate the player
Just hate the game
You break the rules nigga, I'll do the same
What you gonna do when they come for you?
When they come for you?

Hey

I remember sellin' three bricks of straight flour
Got my man a beat down to the third power
He didn't care, spent the money in a half hour
Got some fishscale, reigned on competition like a shower
A .38, a lot of mouth was our only weapon
We was kings till the D's crept in; and now I'm stressin'
Gave him half my paper, told 'em ""Go that route!""
Few months, he got his brain blown out, now I'm missin' him

In your love (in your love)
That's where I'll be, my baby
In my heart (oh yeah)
I'll always keep you with me (not a day)
Not a day goes by (without you)
Without you on my mind
I'll be loving you for life (I'll be loving you)
Think about you all the time

It's been a while
But I can never forget your smile
Seems like yesterday, you were in my arms
I wasn't ready, ready for you to leave so soon
No matter what I know you're in my heart

His baby's mother, she trippin', blamin' me
And his older brothers understand the game it be
Kinda topsy turvy; you win some, you lose some
Damn, they lost a brother, they mother lost a son
Fuck, why my nigga couldn't stay in N.Y.?
I'm a thug, but I swear for three days I cried
I'd look in the sky and ask God why
Can't look his baby girls in the eye; damn, I'm missin' him

That's where I'll be, my baby (that's where I'll be, my baby)

Think about you all the time

I been handling your death like the undertaker
Keep you close to my heart like the pacemaker
Damn, I'm missin' the way we used to kissin'
And you cookin' your favourite dishin'
Fish 'n' Spaghetti
For you to die, I wasn't ready
And life after death, ain't been so fresh
B-I-G, G-I-E
Still a motherfuckin' king of NYC
Period!

I can't you bring you back (I can't you bring you back)
I had to deal with the pain
But you're not around (around)
So much I wish I could say (I could say)
We still got your back (we still got your back)
I put that on everythin'
Never had the chance to say goodbye

That make sure your kicks fit

Make your way to my king sized bed
And lie on my pillows and my Gucci bed spread
Keep the pussy, I got other plans instead
Just gimme some head, gimme some head

If you ain't fuckin' me for life

I don't want it, I don't want it
And if you ain't tryna make me your wife
I don't need it, I don't need it
I'm not about that life
I don't get down, get down like that

I don't want it, I don't want it

Somebody Knows,The King & I,2017,"And the question remains, why was he gunned down in the streets of Los Angeles and who was responsible?
[Chorus: Faith Evans & 
The Notorious B.I.G.

I'm feelin' some type of way
Can somebody explain why? 
(who shot ya)
Why they took your life away and left filled with some much pain
I gotta make it on my own, like who's gon' hold me down, down  
(who shot ya)
Your life was so profound, can't nobody wear your crown
They took your life in vain but your memories still remain
It's a misery to me, I'll give anything to know 
who shot ya
And I swear to god I know somebody knows 
who shot ya
Somebody knows
[Verse 1: Faith Evans & 
The Notorious B.I.G.
]
We were havin' a good time up in the party
Even though we wasn't really speakin' at the time
And we never got to have a conversation
That still weighs heavy on my mind
Busy ignorin' each other
We didn't know if we be over
In just a matter of time 
(neighbors call the cops, said they heard mad shots)
[Pre-Chorus: Faith Evans & 
The Notorious B.I.G.

I felt so helpless and frustrated and I damn near lost my mind

Twenty years have come and gone
There is so much we need to know 
(Old school, new school need to learn though)
And until I get some kind of resolution
I cannot choose to let go (yeah)
No help from the police
So we hang on to the memories
Whoever did it better stay low-key
'Cause it's 
hard to creep them Brooklyn streets

I don't even know where to start and it's very hard to address it
A conversation still that most niggas don't want to mess with
Continue his blessings I send to you and Mama Wallace
To this day I carry a picture of BIG in my wallet
While I give you these bars, I try not to lose my composure
It has been twenty years and yes you still lookin' for closure
Still can't try over bein' a baby, not havin' my father
My heart continues to go after CJ and T'yanna
Tryna avoid truckin' 'bout it, not to revisit the drama
Let me remind the shooter that the most gangster nigga is karma
Big Poppa, yes, we will rep your legacy proper
And now downtown to provide the answers in your honor
Frank and Pac, I hope y'all had the chance to talk in heaven fellas
About the truth that really led to why y'all both ain't here to tell us
Y'all probably up there talkin' about who really fuckin' did it
Maybe you a sinners should sign with some honest answers in it
I walk to Tillery park where we use to smoke with Flex and
Even after all this time, we could never fully accept it
From Western house Brooklyn to bein' one of the great
To the last time we linked up, I shed a tear at your wake

I don't know what I'll be doing, but I ain't think I'll be doing this

When I was a little girl, everybody told me singing was my destiny, but I was thinking I would make a career out of doing the beat box (laughs)

Nah, I know you ain't saying you know how to beat box

Don't be trying to play me out

Give me some old school flavor

Wednesday is the Benz day, that's what your friends say
So I guess you think I'm slippin' cause I ain't flippin'
Baby, I'm Big Poppa, ain't no need to be trippin'

I don't care about the money or the cars that you got uh
'Cause it don't mean nothing
I done did a whole lot and I got my own
I can teach you some thing
I'm not impressed by those things
'Cause I ain't the one who needs you
The reason that I fuck with you ain't because I need you baby
I do what I wanna do, I don't need a man to save me

You don't never have to do without it with me

I hear you jump in every car, except for mine
But you mean them Benzes and Bentleys they see me in all the time?
The range rover trucks? That's all mine
You better slow your roll baby, you ain't got enough dough to pay me
You know the pin number, just page me when you real baby

You could do the same for me
Baby you're so bright on top
I could be your everything
Just don't take me for granted
Like someone else couldn't have it
There's so many fish in the sea (so many fish in the sea)

Inhale this, clench your fist
Then ya, feel the mist through the uterus
Can ya, picture this?
Life without me? Wake up, you're having bad dreams
Cause ya fiend for a toke
My crew tote Tocques and mink coats
On the cell with the boat
What you thought, get caught, get bailed out?
Fuck the jailhouse, Hennessey on the rocks
Is all we got as we sail out, entrepeneurs
Cristal pourer, be glad we ain't takin' yours
Boring huh? I'm warnin' ya
Style waits for no bitch, I dream rich
When I fuck with scratch and sniff
Now I stacks the shit, and practice it
So no bitch can tax the shit, miraculous
So I can relax a bit, and get my dick licked
Drugs, baby
Haha

Need a little something that can take me there
To a place that I can get away from
My feelings so far away
Somewhere with my head up in the clouds
Suddenly it doesn't feel so loud
So far, away, somewhere

I got 'em
Ayo, platinum choker, heavy smoker
The gun toter, Barrack Obam' supporter
Recently Hillary voter
Smoking loud way up in the cloud
Disappearing in my thoughts
Disappearing from courts
Yao Ming face, eyes chinky
Kush got my breath stinky
50 thousand large shine on my pinky
Women lust me, they say I'm too ghetto
They can't trust me, my timeline be filled with his bitch
He wanna bust me, Mira Mira talk
Coca Cola deals, big scales
Doing different shit, Alaska
SnapChatting at Wheels Donnie
My prognosis is atrocious out the black wraith
Fly shit, never down, I stay with some faith
Ahh

Need a little something that can take me there
To a place that I can get away from
My feelings so far away
Somewhere with my head up in the clouds
Suddenly it doesn't feel so loud
So far, away, somewhere

Dreamt of Ferraris and Ferragamos
Raised on the streets, and married the marijuana
Told the joint terminate my thoughts like Sarah Conner
But it couldn't, but I smoked with Big, a badge of honor
And Faith, what's fate?
Light and 8th and I'm straight
That's the morning
But I'mma need a zip when it's late
I used to sit on the crate
But now I dip in the seats
Of the Cherokee
The therapy's a spliff to the face (huh?)
I'm from the strain gang and the mean team
Cut the lights, turn the beat on, let the pain bang
Light the joint, the escape route
You heard it from the Ghost
But you should it hear it from Faith now

Need a little something that can take me there
To a place that I can get away from
My feelings so far away
Somewhere with my head up in the clouds
Suddenly it doesn't feel so loud
So far, away, somewhere

I wouldn't change it for nothing

You took me hand in hand
And made me your wife

We just tryna get by

Oh, this is the story of my life
Tryna keep the drama and the bullshit away
I stay so busy on my grind
I don't they even pay attention to the things that they say
A nigga never been as broke as me, I like that
Now we're makin' this money, gotta get it while I can
When I was young I had two pair of Lees (besides that)
The pin stripes and the gray, the one I wore on Mondays and Wednesdays
While niggas flirt I'm sewing tigers on my shirts, and alligators
You want to see the inside, I see you later
Here comes the drama, oh
That's that nigga with the fake, bloaw!
Why you punch me in my face? Stay in your place
Play your position, here come my intuition
Go in this nigga pocket, rob him while his friends watchin'

The milks was chocolate, the cookies, butter crunch
Pass the blunt
No matter how I did it, I had to stay winnin'
If it was 'bout the paper, I was with it (yeah)
I was a shame, my crew was lame
I had enough heart for most of them
Long as I got stuff from most of them
It's on, even when I was wrong I got my point across
They depicted me the boss, of course
My orange box-cutter make the world go round
Plus I'm fuckin' bitches, ain't my homegirls now
Start stackin', dabbled in crack, gun packin'
Nickname Medina make the seniors tote my niñas
From gym class to English pass off a global
The only nigga with a mobile, can't you see like Total

We take the good, we take the bad
It's not about what we had
We just tryna get by

Tanqueray or Hennessy until I called Earl
Ten months in this gut, what the fuck
I wish moms would hurry up so I could get buck
While, Juvenile rippin' mics and shit
New York, New York ready for the likes of this

Every single day, I'm blessed to look into his eyes
And I can't help but see no-one, but you
You gave the gift of motherhood
And I raised him up, the best I could
Never got to know you, but he's so much like you

And it's a damn shame
Why you're not here today

Why did you go?
But a child just don't understand

Umbilical chord's wraped around my neck
I'm seein' my death, and I ain't even took my first step
(Luckily she made it, must have been right on time. Through his grace, everything was fine)
I made it out, I'm bringin' mad joy
The doctor looked and said ""He's gonna be a Bad Boy.""

""What kind of girls do you like?"" Well, that's various
I like long hair, or them Halle Berry cuts
Real big butts, yeah, thick with lipstick
'Cause when it come to girls, I'm so optimistic
Like the Sounds of Blackness
I don't need practice in the sack
It's natural, I break your back in
I pop coochies like my homeboy Luke
Guaranteed to knock your trees off your Timbo boots
You don't get pussy-whipped, you whip that pussy
Hit it from the back 'til it get real gushy, baby
Good sex is what I'm startin'
I get the skin so wet, I make the ass start fartin'
And I pray that dick don't slip
'Cause then I'm hearin' this shit: ""That's not it""
And then I just ride 'til the sun rise
And when I'm done, wipe the cum on her thighs, I am

This is going out to the pimps and macs
That hit skins 'til their broad catch a asthma attack
But not even Pamatti Miss could resist
The way I jumped up and dissed the clitoris
All I wanna do is zoom-a-zoom in the boom poom (Uh, uh)
Smoke a little boom, get some head in the bedroom
And then I whisper soft in the ear:
""You ain't got to home but you got to leave from here""
Simple and plain, no strings attached
I'm lettin' you know that I'm a certified mac
I hit skins 'til the leg cramp
So on the first I can get half the check and half the stamps

Pepsi Freestyle,The Notorious B.I.G. - Ready To Die (The O.G. Edition),UnKnown,"Hey yo, Enuff, man! What you got to drink up in here, man? I'm thirsty
Big slam, quick slam, tin can, whatever
Whether too cold or too hot, you got to keep Pepsi in the freezer
I keep a 3 liter for my crew
My girl like them diet joints too
For when she watch her weight, crack the top I can't wait
Other sodas taste the worst -- I don't even converse
If it can't quench my thirst what you in my fridge for?
What you wanna live for? Life with the dry mouth
Hot like the south, flash out ya 12 ounce and renounce
Nothing can beat the P-e-p-s-i
Yes I drink it constantly; cop it by the case, tastes great, less filling
Non-alcoholic I can feed it to my children

Ill thinker explodin' when the paper hits the ink
Grab your gangster chronicles and turn to page 6-6-6-
The holocaust, BIG the merciless
Hurry up and close the gate when my freestyle escapes
I'm giving young minds statutory rape
Mothafuckers thought I slip bust my lip, right?
You didn't know the extra clip's on my hip
You don't want none of me N-O-N-A-M-E-(T-H-O-D Man)
Don't tempt me, you don't wanna fuck with M-E

Here I am, I'll be damned if this ain't some shit
Come to spread the butter lyrics over hominy grit
It's the low killer death trap, yes I'm a jet black ninja
Comin' where you rest at, surrender
Step inside the ring, youse the number one contender
Lookin' cold booty like your pussy in December
Nigga stop bitchin', button up ya lip and
From Method all you gettin' is a can of ass-whippin'
Hey, I'll be kickin', you son, you doin' all the yappin'

You front and got me mad enough to touch somethin'
Yo I'm from Shaolin, Island, and ain't afraid to bust somethin'
So what cha' want nigga, ya won't nigga

No question, I be comin' down and shit
Yo I gets rugged as a motherfuckin' carpet get
And niggas love it, not in the physical form but in the mental

Welcome to my center
Honeys feel it deep in they placenta
Cold as the pole in the winter
Ricochet off the vertebrae then splat where your heart be at
Now starts the cardiac arrest Where's your vest?
You forgot now you slowly drop cuz your heart stopped
Beaten, your bitch-ass crew is retreatin
Niggas left you, fucked up passed out with your ass out
Pockets ran through stripped with your brains bashed out
Niggas wanna do me slugs just run through me
Like trees to branches
Cliffs to avalanches
It's the praying mantis
Deep like the mind of Farrakhan
A motherfuckin' rap phenomenon, plus

I make it hot (Niggas won't even stand next to you)
Nigga touch me you better bust me

Mumbling and whispering is what I hear

Why? I'm not the stick-up man
I don't want the rings on your hand, I don't understand
When I come thru the avenue I must know voodoo
Cause all eyes are on you know who - huh!
And my so-called friends beg for ends for me to lend
But this bankrolls they won't spend
I don't need 'em, let the welfare feed 'em
When it come to 'wassup' the peace sign is how I greet em - uh
Sometimes they won't get that, sweating me for some chit-chat
Bite my lyrics like kit-kats
Open your eyes, realize ain't no sugar in my tank
Out of all my friends, there's just one I want to thank
My man Big D taught me a lesson that was great
That good things come to those who wait
And we've waited through the suffering and pain
And bitches ride the dick like the A-train
That's why I flip
Keep a burner to my hip
Take a hooker to the crib, you know she got to strip
Stay dip, take out of state trips
Don't drink a lot of Hennessy, I only take a sip
I'm a skipper, like a captain, rapping is my specialty
And the best is me, so the rest will see
B.I.G. don't need to practice
I'm like a sharpshooter shoot the needle off a cactus
Only thing I lack is stage fright and conceit
I completely defeat the weak - uh
Even the strong don't last long
Cause I'm Brooklyn born, bay-bro
I'm not a paper gangster of no sort, don't smoke Newports
When I get stressed I grab my vest
Put a MC to the test quick specially if he talk slick about who we flipped then whipped
I tripped the competition, stepped across the step to the big boss
You know, of course, they took a loss
Steppin to big and a hitman 50 grand
Like sinkin' in quicksand, ya need a hand my man
Damn, tried to give you the warning sign
When I said chill, I wasn't sayin' LL rhyme
I was telling ya not to flare up
He's about to tear up, I'm telling you not to erupt
Cause he just as corrupt as a DJ should be - huh
50 Grand, and I'm the BIG

Yo, here we go here we go here we go here we go here we go motherfucker here we go

And i'll bet the dough from my show they can't get wit
Mister Cee on the flow till I get bit

Nah nah nah nah nah love. you can't do it like that love. you got to ride that motherfucker you know what I'm sayin? you got to riiide that motherfucker
Try to get props on the brother, that pops the most
And clocks the most, drops the most shit like a pigeon
Listen, to the words I'm slippin' through saliva
Ain't a MC liver, I'm the rap MacGyver
Doin' tricks with my lips so quick
If you blink you would miss the great style of Chris
Don't try to diss, cause I dismiss, dissaprove, dissapoint
Rappers that think they the joint
Huh, they'll get the point quicker
Faster even, MC's I'm leavin' until you can't breathin
You call it a homicide, I call it a suicide
Try to battle me boy ya deserve to die
Punch ya in your eye, before I blade ya

Do the Mack do, what you wanna do, you savour
This step is called the BRU to the T
Bust the rhymes for free, I gets down
Mack is inside your town
Busting lyrics tourture like the missiles slow you down
Sup with B.I.G? Pass the microphone to you so I can take a puff

Who throw gats to Guiliani?
Flows tighter than pigeon punani, try me, die G
Dangerous, since my daddy bust me out the tip of his dick

Flavour like Tropicana; orange, mango, peach

Niggas get to bendin', got two cases, one pending
560 V-12 engine, niggas swimmin'

Like Ill and Al Skratch smokin' 50 sacks in the back of Ac's
Windows cracked, so sit back relax
Craig, crush the hash, the Beretta's in the stash

Well, BANG! let's kick it off like a butt
More fakes than Allen front to leave you lost like a treasure hunt
From now on, y'all crossed the land
Craig Mack's the upper hand with more rhymes than the beach got sand
You're an MC, yo my original job is that mistaken raps'll guarantee you look like a slob
I got more rhymes than kids got the measles
You shooting needles, we are bigger than The Beatles
I crush , hush with the Super Sunday rush
We're trotting to the cot cause your style turns back to mush
I flip out the funk off the frame
Now you know my name- Mackalicious, ain't you got a king?
Before 10:00 Westwood, I'm no good
Shaking from here to back to Breckwood
On One FM rap show, the illest flow that you ever heard on your radio
Biggie Smalls, my motherfucking man, take the microphone and kick the wicked like a man

I went from construction Timbs to Acs with rims
Flipping mixtapes to bitches feeding me grapes
Peep my mind state, Big Poppa flow is lethal
That weed make my ass wanna KILL FOUR PEOPLE!
Forget the dames, gimme the range and the wain
My niggas up the pawn drop top jag walls
Blindfold you when you step in the car
That's the superstar status apparatus, more wings than clutches
Cease roll the hash, it's in the pocket with the nine
Lick off the wine as my seats recline
I want a presidential Rollie
So I crush MC's, the guacamole making Robin scream ""Holy Molly!""
Big Poppa, off the caper, I'm that paper crusader
Playing Sega in a widebody blazer
And if you don't know now you know
My flow you pick like an afro
Wet like Soul Glo

Licking shots niggas screaming Biggie Smalls tried to kill us

I get ill...
It's time for a funk refill of rhymes that I kill as I shoot 'em in the grill
MC's, I'm not impressed
Your best don't just throw your chest
Where's the bullet proof or the wool vest, won't matter
Your chest will shatter

Went from 10k to 24k, competition hated, J.M. sedated
Quarantine
Big for president, busting shots past your spleen
9 millimeter dreams, Mac 11 nightmares
Which MC's do you fear? Big Poppa, Junior M.A.F.I.A, nuff said
Niggas disrespect just I dead

Just I dead
MC's will turn red from the shot I lick, Ceaser sick
Too much shagging, too much drinking, too much thinking
MC's are blinking the third eye when I pass by
Mackalicious got the sweet potato fried for you motherfucker, I... touch the microphone
I do or die, make the hardest motherfucker cry when a MC pass by
I flip rhymes off the top of my head just like Raid I spray MC's until they dead
A vocal volcanic microphone, robotic tonic atonic
The microphone is mine so MC's panic
I get down for my ground
You could see I met James Brown in your town
Flipping funk on a Friday on my malware
In the highway, takes MC's by the driveway, driveway
Slow ill flow, so you know, head to toe
Ill bend flows when I go...
From flow to top ten... to dough...
Flow ill flow, Badboy down said so
So Biggie Smalls my man, take command
Turn each MC you see into sand
(Change of beat)

I stretch the funk like my name was Plastic Man
Eating MC's out the can in my hip-hop wonderland
I got the venom like the snake's got the venom, I put it in 'em
Faces turn bluer than my denim
But don't look down though my name is David Banner
Flipping green on the mic cause they can't control my gamma
So stop hogging us, Mack's the erogenous
So rap full grown, see us the acrogynous
There ain't a rapper liver than the rebel
My voice don't carry treble, eat MC's like a vegetable
Crack a few stepping on the pedal
Heavy off the medal, life's stronger waiting for the sun to settle
King MC, for that I thank the LORD
Ill vocal chords sometimes you get the style bored
As we break it down, Biggie Smalls represent Brooklyn your hometown
(Change of Beat)

Niggas in my faction don't like asking questions
Strictly gun testing, coke measuring
Giving pleasure in the Benzito
Hitting fannies, spending chips at Manny's
Hope you creeps got receipts, my peeps get dirty like cleats
Run up in your crib, wrap you in your Polo sheets
6 up in your wig-piece, nigga decease
Mxwaah! May you rest in peace
With my Sycamore style, more sicker than yours
.44 and 54 draws
As my pilot, steers my Lear- yes, my dear
Shit's official, only the Feds I fear
Here's a tissue, stop your blood clot crying
The kids, the dog, everybody dying, no lying
So don't you get suspicious
I'm Big dangerous you're just a little vicious
As I leave my competition, respirator style
Climb the ladder to success escalator style
Hold y'all breath, I told y'all
Death controls y'all, Big don't fold y'all
I spit phrases that'll thrill you
You're nobody 'til somebody kills you
(Change of beat)

Your reign on the top was short like leprechauns
As I crush so-called willies, thugs, and rapper-dons
Get in that ass, quick fast, like Ramadan
It's that rap phenomenon Don Dada
Fuck Poppa, you got to call me Francis M.H. White
Intake light tokes, tote iron
Was told in shootouts, stay low, keep firing
Keep extra clips for extra shit
Who's next to flip on that cat with that grip on rap
The most shady, Frankie baby
Ain't no telling where I may be
May see me in D.C. at Howard Homecoming
With my man Capone, dumbing, fucking something
You should know my steelo
Went from 10 G's for blow to 30 G's a show
To orgies with hoes I never seen before
So, Jesus, get off the Notorious'
Penis before I squeeze and bust
If the beef between us, we can settle it
With the chrome and metal shit
Make it hot like a kettle get
You're delicate, you better get - who sent ya?
You still pedal shit, I got more rides than Great Adventure",https://genius.com/The-notorious-big-1995-westwood-freestyle-me-and-craig-lyrics
Grab My Gun,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Grab the 9,2 clips and run a muck!
So I grab my gun
A fist-full of bullets,a chest full of teflon
Nowhere to run,so I grab my gun!

I'm sticking ice picks on the tip of your dick
Give your testicles a swift kick ain't that some shit
Am I hard-hardcore harder than the Plymouth
It ain't no myth. It's a nigga with a spliff
And a chrome four-fifth pressed on yo back
So what you want nigga?
How you wanna act?
I'm uncivilized cause I love to see niggas die
Brains all leaking out on the street
And the pastor preaching: he was a good man
Played the bad man when the 
burner
 was in his hand
Now he's singing sad songs with Elvis
Three to the head, 'bout six cross the pelvis
You fuck with the high die you die
You're the same motherfucker
If you look up in the sky
I want some old nex shit
Suplex shit
Hardcore sex shit

Grab the 9, 2 clips and run a muck!
So I grab my gun
A fist-full of bullets,a chest full of teflon
Nowhere to run,so I grab my gun!

A repetitive loop all I need to display
Solo is the proof I put it to you boy
Hope you got the scoop
Biggie Smalls the rap genius
I keep the Glock by the penis
The cleanest cut fuck sluts
With the big humongous butts
I used to rub a butt
My style is Gucci like the hookers pussy
And it don't take a lot of back talk
To push me into flamin 'em
Like that little nigga Damien
Glock 19 to my motherfucking cranium
Gang-thight gun toting motherfucker
Niggas in they brains thought biggie was a sucker
I tricked 'em, I gave 'em work then I sticked 'em
I stripped 'em, cause niggas dont want the friction
Told you before how I bring the drama
Slaying Larry Johnson and his grand mama!

Grab the 9,2 clips and run a muck!
So I grab my gun
A fist-full of bullets,a chest full of teflon
Nowhere to run,so I grab my gun!

Fuck around and feel the fury of a high nigga when I get busy, throw ya hands in the sky nigga I got the illest of the ill mentality
Niggas be grabbing me, knowing that they rather be stabbing me
All up in my back, try'na  take my track
When I used to sell crack I ain't had problems like that
Street rules, watch your pockets and your jewels
A nigga front throw a gat to the fool next one to move is getting blasted
Streets to a flows from the ill ghetto bastard
As I release Master piece it's like indecent
Stuck to your ass like tissue when you're wiping fast
MC's have a hard time believin'
I'm marked with death hard to kill like Steven
With Jacob I'm leavin' the black man's motto: ""You got a better chance playing lotto""

Grab the 9,2 clips and run a muck!
So I grab my gun
A fist-full of bullets, a chest full of teflon
Nowhere to run, so I grab my gun!",https://genius.com/The-notorious-big-grab-my-gun-lyrics
Never Dead,UnKnown,UnKnown,"All I want is bitches, big-booty bitches
Used to sell crack, so I could stack my riches
Now I pack gats to stop all the snitches
From staying in my business, what is this, relentless
Approach to know if I'm broke or not
Just cause I joke and smoke a lot
Don't mean I don't tote the Glock
16 shots for my niggas in the pen
Until we motherfucking meet again
I'm doing rhymes now, fuck the crimes now
Come on the ave, I'm real hard to find now
Cause I'm knee-deep in the beats
In the Land Cruiser Jeep with the MAC-10 by the seats
For the jackers, the jealous-ass crackers in the blue suits
I'll make you prove that it's bulletproof
Hold your head, cause when you hit the bricks
I got gin, mad blunts, and bitches sucking dick
The funk, baby
[Chorus 2x}
They wanna bury me, I'm worried, I'm losing my mind
Look down the barrel of my 9, and my vision's blurry
Never will I die, I'll be back
Reincarnated as a motherfucking mack, put the pistol to my head

Damned if I don't, and damned if a nigga do
Now watch a young motherfucker pull the trigger too
RAISE UP, and don't let them see ya cry
Dry your eyes, young nigga time for do or die
I pack a pistol in my pocket, ready on my Glock
Ain't no time for a nigga to even cock shit
I done seen a motherfucker peep pain
At point blank range cause he slept on the game
Ain't a damn thing changed, they shakin' the dice
Now roll em if you can't stand pain better hold em
Cause ain't no tellin' what ya might roll
You might fold catch AIDS from a slight cold
You better live ya life to the fullest
Be quick to kill a bull got a pistol motherfucker better pull it
And even if they kill me
They can never take the life of a young G


Bitches in the back looking righteous
In a tight dress, I think I might just
Hit her with a little Biggie 101, how to tote a gun
And have fun with Jamaican rum
Conversation, blunts in rotation
My man Big Jock got the Glock in his waist and
We're smoking, drinking, got the hooker thinking
If money smell bad, then this nigga Biggie stinking
Is it my charm? I got the hookers eating out my palm
She grabbed my arm and said ""Let's leave calm""
I'm hitting skins again
Rolled up another blunt, bought a Heineken
Niggas start to loc out, a kid got choked out
Blows was thrown and a fucking fight broke out

I live Thug Life, and let the money come to me
Cause they can never take the game from a young G


Still on parole and I'm the first nigga servin'
Pour some liquor on the curb, for my homies that deserve it
If I wanna make a million, gotta stay dealin'
Kinda boomin' round the way, think today I make a killin'
Dressin' down like I'm dirty, but only on the block
Just a clever disguise, to keep me runnin' from the cops
Gettin' high I think I'll die if I don't get no ends
I'm in a bucket but I'm ridin' it like it's a Benz
I hit the strip I let my music buck
Drinkin' liquor and I'm lookin' for a bitch to fuck
Rather die makin' money, than live poor and legal
As I slang another ounce, I wish it was a kilo

So I guess you know the story, the rap-side, crack-side
How I smoked funk, smacked bitches on the backside
Bed-Stuy: the place where my head rests
50-shot clip if a nigga want test
The rocket launcher, Biggie stomped ya
High as a motherfucking helicopter
That's why I pack a Nina, fuck a misdeameanor
Beating motherfuckers like Ike beat Tina

They couldn't tell me nothin', they all tried to help me
The marijuana had my mind gone it wasn't healthy
I traveled places, caught cases, what a ill year
I felt the pain and the rain but I'm still here
Never did like the police, let the whole world know
Now I gets no peace, cause they chasin' me down
And facin' me now, what do I do?
These things that a Thug goes through
And still I rise",https://genius.com/The-notorious-big-never-dead-lyrics
Juicy Clean Version for my class use,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Yeah, this album is dedicated to all the teachers
That told me I'd never amount to nothin'
To all the people that lived above the buildings that I was hustlin'
In front of that called the police on me when I was just tryin'
To make some money to feed my daughter
To all my peoples in the struggle, you know what I'm sayin'?
It's all good baby, baby, check it
It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up magazine
Salt 'n' Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hangin' pictures on my wall
Every Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl
Remember Rappin' Duke? Duh-ha, duh-ha
You never thought that hip hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G, Brucey B, Kid Capri
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starsky
Now honies play me close like butter played toast
From the Mississippi down to the East Coast
Condos in Queens, indo for weeks
Sold out seats to hear Biggie Smalls speak
Livin' life without fear
Puttin' 5 karats in my baby girl's ear
Lunches, brunches, interviews by the pool
Considered a fool 'cause I dropped out of high school
Stereotypes of a black male misunderstood
We used to fuss when the landlord dissed us
No heat, wonder why Christmas missed us
Birthdays was the worst days
Now we sip champagne when we thirsty
Damn right I like the life I live
'Cause I went from negative to positive
And it's all, it's all good",https://genius.com/The-notorious-big-juicy-clean-version-for-my-class-use-lyrics
Biggie Smalls Got That Hype Shit,UnKnown,UnKnown,"""Well, who is 'Biggie Smalls'?""

Notorious Biggie Smalls in full effect
Got my DJ Fifty Grand in the house, you know what I'm saying
I'ma nice long rhyme on this funky track
You know how we get down, yo

Shake your head and say damn (yeah!)
When the words from Big-man
Explode like an ash-can
While DJ Fifty Grand
Kick beats like Van Damme
That fighting ass nigga?
Introducing the supreme Bigga, nigga!
Yes, it's the B
I break with the bonus
Bumrush bums and bitch-ass opponents
Bucks plug out ya brain
Break your back bone
Send ya back home
Back to the wack zone
Try to underrate the heavy weight
But when I dominate, you couldn’t wait to play me on your tape
Press rewind, maybe two times or three times
Here to rhyme, to blind your mind like Moonshine
Biggie Smalls got bitches in Brazil, boy
Use a rubber if the bitch is on the pill, boy
The complete opposite of a kill-joy
Stick-ups, shoot-outs, hustling, I get ill, boy
Niggas run up, they say ""Big, I wanna battle ya!
I think I could burn ya!"" from where, Attica?
Look at you, you're shaking like a pair of dice!
And when I rip ya, rob ya, roast ya then you'll say I'm trice!
Man, don't try to gas me or juice me
Smoke you like a loosie
I pack a MAC, you pack a deuce-deuce, G
So press up
Before you messed up
That's your best luck
The kinda sort, run you over in the 4 by 4
And the tag on your toe will read Derelict
Pass the blunt, I take a hit
Pass the drink, I take a sip
Pass the skins, I take a dip
Pass my loot, before I flip
Man, brother, man, brother man!
I thought you knew the pedigree of the B.I.G
Cut emcees like lumberjacks cutting trees
Rip microphones like Freddy rip kids
Like car rigs do bids
My burner's always there
To the back, to the side, to the front
Smoke a blunt, break ya like Ivana broke Trump
You little young chump
Yeah, reach for your gun
Make sure you get done
Be a ghost like Michael Landon
And the rhyme keeps flowing
Like the rabbit with the drum, I keep going and going
And showing MC's how to flow, yo
I smoke weed like Tony Montana sniff the yayo
""Be slow bro!
Slow down before you get slowed down, quick!""
Which burner you wanna get hit with, pick!
I'm the wrong nigga to be fucking with
So sit back and admit, Biggie Smalls got that hype shit!

Biggie got the hype shit!
He got the hype shit!
Biggie got the hype shit!
He got the hype shit!
Biggie got the hype shit!
He got the hype shit!
Biggie got the hype shit!
He got the hype shit!

Lyric enhancement is a must
That's why I bust
Dope raps like a burner bust caps
I'm used to making tracks
That's why my rap sounds like that
I get my props and all my pats on the back
B-I, double G-I-E Smalls
Who the nigga in the place? Watch him fall
Check all the pockets for some loot
Take the girl, knock the boots
If she's cute, I'm the pimp, she's the prostitute
Hey! Sippin' on the heineken
Ain't a rapper finer than
The B.I.G and Fifty Grand
Suckers better try again
Before you get lifted and twisted
You better smoke a spliff, kid I'm gifted
Fill it to the tip, with the dope shit
Nigga, fifty-shot clip to my hip
Skip to my lou, special shout-outs to my crew
Fifty Grand and the OGB flucture through
I'm dynamite, out of sight on the mic
Three and two, Frank got ya sleeping with the night light
So wake up and smell the coffee
You're nothing but a softie
Rappers screaming ""Biggie, get off me!""
Don't have me go off, G
Cause I'm just lukewarm
And I'm not the type to toot my own horn
But uh, toot toot!
I take my timbo boots
And just lose it
You fucking piece of bowel movement!
My tec got a long clip
Biggie Smalls got the hype shit!

Biggie got the hype shit!
He got the hype shit!
Biggie got the hype shit!
He got the hype shit!
Biggie got the hype shit!

Drop cops that mistake me for Rodney
Strictly head shots, I knock the twist out your dreadlocks
Who got the props? Biggie Who got the Glock? Biggie But who is he?
You can't get my description, you need a prescription
Two doses of the ferocious

Stuffing 'em, I put the pressure on em, hon
Lord a mercy, Jesus Christ, He's just nice, he just slice like a Ginsu
It's me, the Notorious B.I.G-G.I.E Smalls, yo!
This is for chumps that don't know who I am
I had a song on the soundtrack ""Who's The Man?""
The single was dope, but the movie didn't slam
Emcees is like JJ's moms, ""Damn, damn damn!""
Is it because I rip the props or beat the cops?
I got more dough than a pizza shop
Biggie Smalls is the illest
Your style is played out like Arnold and that ""whatchu talkin 'bout Willis?""
7 Mac Elevens, 8 .38s nine 9s, ten MAC 10s, the guns never end!
Biggie Smalls, the millionaire, the mansion, the yacht
The two weed spots, the two hot Glocks
Huh, that's how I got the weed spot
I shot dread in the head, took the bread and the Lambsbread
Lil' Gotti got the shotty to your body
So don't resist or you might miss Christmas
I tote guns, I make number runs
I give MCs the runs dripping
When I throw my clip in the AK, I slay from far away

Even know the store where his momma buy her dresses
She gon' be the first one to ride in a Hearse son
Worse come to worse I'll kill his sister, I'll know he'll miss her
They just a family, other half of me, them niggas scared of me
I hope they prepared to be shot at, hit up with baseball bats
Thrown in the back of the Ac' with a trunk full of rats
Drive to Brooklyn and back, take him to the pier (Where?)
Way up in the back where the bums sleep at
Look him in the eye, ""You wanna die, don't ya?""
""If you could change everything you did, you would, won't ya?""
But you can't, 'cause my brother can't breathe
Watching him bleed in the hospital, I had to leave
All I wanna do is kill your crew
Your grand moms might get wet on the church-house steps
The beef is set, whatever, show you the meaning of pressure
Killing faggot niggas like ya'll for pleasure (uh)

In the bottom of the ocean, who the fuck you gon' tell?
Who the fuck you gon' see that can outlast me?
Outlast me, stamina's nasty
Call erase on Trife, well Blake call me Snake
How you gonna act when you hear these .9s break?
Car doors closing, trench coats open
Tommy gun start smoking
Leave you on a cold street, chokin'
On your own blood, fuck the joking, I ain't kidding
MAC spitting, niggas gettin' hit, backflippin' wounded
Tryna plea, breaking off full speed
Jumping over gates, screaming, ""Vec, it wasn't me""
I see the fear as I stare through these Cartier lenses

Breathing mad hard, begging God for forgiveness

Rap critics that say he's Money, Cash, Hoes
I'm from the hood stupid, what type of facts are those
If you grew up with holes in your zapatos
You'd celebrate the minute you was having dough
I'm like fuck critics, you can kiss my whole asshole
If you don't like my lyrics, you can press fast forward
Got beef with radio if I don't play they show
They don't play my hits, well I don't give a shit, so
Rap mags try and use my black ass
So advertisers can give em more cash for ads, fuckers

Message To Young Rappers,UnKnown,UnKnown,"What advice would I give to young rappers? Take control of your shit, don't -- don't be the type of rapper.. Don't be a stupid rapper.
A stupid rapper is a motherfucker that has somebody else tell them what to do -- which is not always wrong, but -- if it's something that you feel that you don't have to do, you really have to question it and find out why they want you to do it. Most niggas, they feel like, well, ""you see what Biggie's doing! Y'know, he has the hat, the Kangol, and, and this, and you have to be like that!"" But if you don't really wanna be like that, you don't have to be like that, you know what I'm saying? A lot of motherfuckers just try to tell a nigga to do something so quick, and -- and give them examples of other motherfuckers who did it and blew up and make them think they can do the same thing, which is not always necessarily true. And at the same time, you got to watch your money. It's so much funny shit in this game, man -- and they can play with your money, and you won't even know. I mean, as soon as I got in the game, I got a lawyer to watch my lawyer. That's just the way it's supposed to be played, you know what I'm saying? I speak to niggas -- I speak to niggas that got money in the game and they let me know, you know dog, it's a ""dog eat dog'' world. Niggas is trying to get as much as they can. And if you a ignorant motherfucker, they gon' thrive off that. They can tell you anything. And I'm -- I never been stupid, so.. Especially with a whole big lump sum of money? I gotta keep by on that. So I just stay more in the business side of everything -- instead of being a nigga that's gonna be drunk at the bar and fuck all the bitches and.. and just, stay in hotels all day, and just trick a whole lot of money, I stay home with my wife and watch my money. It comes a lot easier that way. And.. you'll have a lot of money!",https://genius.com/The-notorious-big-message-to-young-rappers-annotated

Back of my mind I hope she swallow
Man she spilled a drink on my cream Wallows
Reach the gate, hungry, just ate

She starts off, ""Well I don't usually""
Then I whipped it out, rubber? no doubt
Step out, show me what you all about
Fingers in your mouth, open up your blouse
Pull your G-string down South (oww)

Roll the chron'-chron' in the dark pronto
Few puffs, eyes got low
And off to the bedroom we go (mmm)
Sex is drama, head is trauma
Ripped pajamas, I'ma stay 'til tomorrow
Satisfying all my needs twice
With whipped cream, handcuffs and ice

Tha cypher,UnKnown,UnKnown,"(Verse1)
Money, hoes, and clothes
Blunt smoke coming out the nose, is all a nigga knows
Flipping on foes, putting tags on toes
Watching the stash grow, clocking the cashflow
The neighborhood gravedigger
Getting paid so much, all the bitches want to see a nigga
I guess they figure I'm paid, I want to get laid
Or since I got loot, I want to knock boots
I'd rather beat my dick than trick
And if she don't suck, then we don't fuck
I'd rather make a buck, drive a fat-ass truck
Grab the 9, two clips, and run amuck
Yes, flex at the two or three Benzes
I wreck shit, what the fuck you expected?
A fly guy? Well fuck it, I'm the high guy
From Bed-Stuy, putting the swelling on your eye
And your nose even; when I choke ya, you stop breathing
And when Jake come, I'm leaving

(Verse2)
When we smoke spliffs, we pack four-fifths
Just in case Dread want to riff
He get a free lift to the cemetary, rough very
Not your ordinary: we watch you get buried
That's a real nigga for ya
Get mad, do a quarter, flip the script, and rip your lawyer
Spit at the DA, cause fuck what she say
She don't give a fuck about your ass anyway
Back up chump, you know Biggie Smalls rips it quick
And kicks it quick; you know how black niggas get
With the hoods, fatigues with the boots with trees
Smokin weed, flippin ki's, making crazy G's
Hitting buckshots at niggas that open spots
On the avenue--take my loot, and I'm bagging you
Pimping hoes that drive Volvos and Rodeos
Flash the roll, make her wet in her pantyhose
Damn, a nigga's style is unorthodox
Grip the Glock, when I walk down the crowded blocks
Just in case a nigga want to act out
I just black out, and blow they motherfucking back out
That's a real nigga for ya

(Verse3)
Im stuck in jail the DA's tryin' to burn me
I'd be out on bail, If I had a good attorney
Wanna label me a criminal and cuff me up
Got a pocket full of money so they rough me up
I ain't trippin' in the county and im mad as fuck
Got a record so they put me with the baddest bunch
Everybody wanna talk cause im rappin'
They asking me what happend
Is it true you did a flick with Janet Jackson?
I can't sleep they taking polaroids
And im tryna' use the phone but they making noise
Man I wish I had my Glock cause its major
Im making shanks out the plastics in razors
These motherfuckers won't, leave me alone thats my word
'Bout to turn a violation to a motherfucking murder
Im making collect calls to my old bitches
Send mo' pictures, and make me some mo' riches
To all the suckers on the block, talking shit while I was locked up
Be prepared to be socked up
Cause the game is deep, and the fame is brief
And you bullshitting bitches ain't changing me
I came straight up out of gutta' I was saved from hell
Im a thug I was raised in jail, now im out on bail",https://genius.com/The-notorious-big-tha-cypher-lyrics

The Fuck Happened to the home of the brave
Niggas running off headed to the grave
Black president, don't matter
Shit just getting worst life is shattered
A land of freedom is flipping out
All I want is a life without a doubt
Verse 1
Thug life, we all been through it
Life's a struggle though it's not split
Illuminati or whatever the fuck they go by
They the reason why the world so dry
I'm just a nigga tryna live my life
Everyday staying away from the tip of a knife
Or the the fire from a fucking 9 millimeter
This damn Gangasta life is that of a cheater
I'm starting to think we living in a trash can
Jus' waiting to be swallowed up bu the Klu Klux klan
Verse 2
Every night sleeping with a common dream
That everyone be on the same team
When I die, fuck it I wanna go to hell
Cause I'm a piece of shit, it ain't hard to fuckin' tell
It don't make sense, goin' to heaven with the goodie-goodies
Dressed in white, I like black Tims and black hoodies
God'll prolly have me on some real strict shit
No sleepin' all day, no gettin' my dick licked
Hangin' with the goodie-goodies loungin' in paradise
Fuck that shit, I wanna tote guns and shoot dice
All my life I been considered as the worst
Lyin' to my mother, even stealin' out her purse
Crime after crime, from drugs to extortion
I know my mother wished she got a fucking abortion
Verse 3
Dope on the corner, look at the coroner
Daughter is dead, mother is mourning her
Strayed bullets, AK bullets
Resuscitation was waiting patiently but they couldn't
Bring her back, who got the footage?
Channel 9, cameras is looking
It's hard to channel your energy when you know you're crooked
Banana clip, split his banana pudding

Condos in Queens, indo for weeks
Sold out seats to hear Biggie Smalls speak

Puttin' 5 karats in my baby girl's ear
Lunches, brunches, interviews by the pool
Considered a fool cause I dropped out of high school
Stereotypes of a black male misunderstood

No heat, wonder why Christmas missed us
Birthdays was the worst days

Wild juvenile ripping mics and shit
New York, New York, ready for the likes of this
Then came the worst date, May 21st
2:19, that's when my momma water burst
No spouse in the house so she rode for self
To the hospital, to see if she could get a little help
Umbilical cord's wrapped around my neck
I'm seeing my death and I ain't even took my first step
I made it out, I'm bringing mad joy

Get live motherfuckers. Get live motherfuckers!!

Now I'm thirteen, smoking blunts, making cream

Risking ruptured spleens by the age of sixteen
Hearing the coach scream ain't lifetime dream!
I mean I want to blow up, stack my dough up
So school I didn't show up, it fucked my flow up
Mom said that I should grow up and check myself
Before I wreck myself, disrespect myself
Put the drugs on the shelf? Nah, couldn't see it
Scarface, King of New York, I want to be it
Rap was secondary, money was necessary
Until I got incarcerated--kinda scary
C74-Mark 8 set me straight
Not able to move behind the great steel gate

Throw you in a choke; gun smoke, gun smoke
Biggie Smalls for mayor
The rap slayer, the hooker layer

Take her Gucci bag and the North Face off her back
Jab her if she act, funny with the money

Her hittin' the floor and me hittin' the clit
Sucking on the tits, had the hooker beggin' for the dick
And your moms ain't ugly, love, my dick got rocked quick

Of House of Pain and Bobby Brown

Jacked her, then I asked her, ""Who's the man?""

Tears don't affect me, I hit 'em with the TEC, G
Disrespect me, my potency is deadly
I'm shootin' babies; no ifs, ands, or maybes
Hit Mommy in the tummy if the hooker plays a dummy
Slit the wrist of little sis, after she sucked the dick
I stabbed her brother with the ice pick
Because he wanted me to fuck him from the back
But Smalls don't get down like that
Got your father hidin' in a room, fucked him with a broom
Slit him down the back and threw salt in the wound
Who you think you're dealin' with?
Anybody step into my path is fuckin' feelin' it
Hardcore, I got it sucked like a pussy
Stab you 'til you're gushy, so please don't pushh me
I'm using rubbers so they won't trace the semen

Video Musicbox Freestyle,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Look in the sky
Wonder why
Most MCs alibis
Won't comply
With my style of rhyme
Or rhyming or rap
It's not a trap
My rhyme just snap --

And we were laughing and laughing, like ""You ain't never gonna be on Video Musicbox, man..'

Mozzle, mozzle
Run around, mozzle and pop
Yeah I put that on pops

We wanted to find a way to get on the map, fast..
So, that birthed The Techniques. Two DJs, and Chris was THE MC

This is the wail of a tale
Of a male who gotta pay my bills

Back up chump, you know Biggie Smalls?rips?it quick
And kicks?it quick; you know how black?niggas get
With the hoods, fatigues with the boots with trees
Smokin weed, flippin ki's, making crazy G’s
Hitting buckshots at niggas that open spots
On the avenue--take my loot, and I'm bagging you, huh
Pimping hoes that drive Volvos and Rodeos
Flash the roll, make 'em wet in they pantyhose
Damn, a nigga’s style is unorthodox
Grip the Glock, when I walk down the crowded blocks
Just in case a nigga wanna act out
I just black out, and blow they motherfucking back out
That's a real nigga for ya

Get mad, do a quarter, flip the script, and rip your lawyer
Spit at the DA, 'cause fuck what she say

Flipping on foes, putting tags on toes
Watching the stash grow, clocking the cashflow
The neighborhood gravedigger
Getting paid so much, all the bitches want to see a nigga
I guess they figure I'm paid, I want to get laid
Or since I got loot, I want to knock boots
I'd rather beat my dick than trick
And if she don’t suck, then we don’t fuck
I'd rather make a buck, drive a fat-ass truck
Grab the 9, two clips, and run amuck
Yes, flex after two or three Becks
As I wreck shit, what the fuck you expected?
A fly guy? Well fuck it, I’m the high guy
From Bed-Stuy, putting the swelling on your eye
And your nose even; when I choke ya, you stop breathing
And when Jake come, I'm leaving

Na sa dinami dami ng aking tutugunin
Bakit ikaw pa ang napiling hintayin eyy

I love niggas, I love niggas
Because niggas are me

I love to see niggas shoot the shit
But there's one thing about niggas I do not love

To all my Brooklyn
To all my Uptown
To all my Bronx
To all my Queensbridge

Dead Wrong (Original Version),Unreleased Songs,1992,"The weak or the strong, who got it going on?
You're dead wrong
The weak or the strong, who got it going on?
You're dead wrong

Relax and take notes while I take tokes of the marijuana smoke
Throw you in a choke, gun smoke, gun smoke
Biggie Smalls for mayor, the rap slayer
The hooker layer, motherfucker say your prayers
""Hail Mary, full of grace""
Smack the bitch in the face, take her Gucci bag
And the North Face off her back, jab her if she act
Funny with the money, oh you got me mistaken, honey
I don't wanna rape ya, I just want the paper
The Visa, kapeesha? I'm out like The Vapors
Who's the one you call Mr. Macho
The head honcho, swift fist like Camacho
I got so much style I should be down with the Stylistics
""Make up to break up"" Niggas need to wake up
Smell the Indonesia, beat you to a seizure
Then fuck your moms, hit the skins to amnesia
She don't remember shit, just the two hits
Her hitting the floor and me hitting the clit
Sucking on the tits, had the hooker begging for the dick
And your moms ain't ugly, love, my dick got rock quick
I guess I was a combination of House of Pain and Bobby Brown
I was humping around and jumping around
Jacked her then I asked her, ""Who's the man?"" She said, ""B-I-G""
Then I bust in her E-Y-E (Yo Big, you're dead wrong)


Check the pain I inflict, like a convict, the Fulton digger
Jump in the Acura Vigor, after I stick ya
Rip ya like a razor, straight up Henny with no chaser
Watch me erase ya, misplace ya
Put you in the back with the derelicts, yeah, I pop plenty shit
Chump, I'm making hits, no time for the crack rock and shit
Took it to another level
Now I'm getting crazy papes, getting paid from the devils
Another amateur trying to damage the pedigree
Of the B-I-G-G-I-E, you know it's me
Hoes, I thought you know I'm smooth as a baby's ass
Smooth as Teddy Pendergrass
, smoke the grass, get in your ass
The Brooklyn-born Teflon Don, wrecking shop
Getting props, proving nobody drops
Words as potent as the blunt smoking 
Bed-Stuy bandit
And niggas just can't understand it
I bust a cap for the brothers in Nap Nap, Comstock, and 
Clinton
You know my shit is hitting
Yeah, ya'll, a fly nigga, Biggie Smalls
Kicking flavor, make a nigga wanna dig up in their drawers
For the burner, catch a body, I got styles like karate
Jiu-jitsu, when I hit you then I split you
Like a cantaloupe, hope you got a rope to hang yourself
I rob for self; from Brooklyn, where else?
Fat like a Lexus coupe, I ripped your troop
Not even Lois Lane could get the scoop

As I kiss.. your.. ass.. goodnight)
I ain't fuckin with you niggas, I ain't fuckin with you niggas
This stupid nigga, man
Fuck that
Uh
Yo, yo yo yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
Yo yo yo, yo, yo, yo!

I make yo' mouthpiece obese like Della Reese
When I release, you lose teeth like Lil' Cease
Nigga please, blood floods your dungarees
And that's just the half of my warpath
Laugh now cry later, I rhyme greater
Than the average playa hater, and spectators
Buy my CD twice; they see me in the streets
They be like, ""Yo he nice, but that's on the low though""
Be the cats with no dough, tried to play me at my show
I pull out fo'-fo's, and go up in they clothes
Short-change niggas, snort 'caine niggas
Extortion came quicker, bought the Range nigga
Ya still tickle me, I used to be as strong as Ripple be
Til Lil' Cease crippled me
Now I play hard, like my girl's nipples be
The game sour like a pickle be, y'all know da rules
Move from BK to New Jeruz -- thinkin 'bout
All the planes we flew, bitches, we ran through
Now the year's new, I lay my game flat
I want my spot back, take two
Motherfuckers mad cause I blew, niggas envious
Too many niggas on my dick, shit strenuous
When my men bust, you just move with such stamina
Slugs missed ya, I ain't mad at ya (we ain't mad at ya)
Blood rushin', concussions, ain't nothing
Catch cases, come out fronting, smoking something
Sippin' White Russians, bitch in the Benz bumping
I laced it with the basic, six TVs a system
Knockin' Mase shit, face it, we hard to hit
Guard ya shit, 'fore I stick you, for your re-up
Wipe the pee up, lick shots, woke your seed up
Go in the ashtray, spark the weed up
Long kiss

Time, time for you to die (dick-ridin' ass niggas everywhere..)
As I kiss.. your.. ass.. goodnight
Time, time for you to die
As I kiss.. your.. ass.. goodnight (there's more than one dick to ride in the rap game) (no doubt, no doubt)
Time, time for you to die
As I kiss.. your.. ass.. goodnight

What, what, what, what?
I'm flamin' gats, aimin' at, these fucking
Maniacs, put my name in raps, what part the
Game is that? Like they hustle backwards
I smoke Backwoods and Dutchies, you can't touch me
Try to rush me, slugs go, touchy-touchy
You're bleeding lovely, with yo, spirit above me
Or beneath me, your whole life you live sneaky
Now you rest eternally, sleepy, you burn when you creep me
Rest where the worms and the weak be
My nine flies, baptize, rap guys
With the Holy Ghost, I put holes in most
You hold your toast shaky, slippin' tryin' to break me
Look what you made me do, brains blew
My team in the marine-blue, six Coupe
Skeeted out, weeded out, cleanin' out -- the block
For distances, givin' long kisses bitch!

Time, time for you to die
As I kiss.. your.. ass.. goodnight
Time, time for you to die
As I kiss.. your.. ass.. goodnight
Time, time for you to die
As I kiss.. your.. ass.. goodnight

Frank White the menacing, Chron-Chron's the medicine
I got the lettuce and, you turn green like cucumber skin
Got the new, Hummer in the summer when I was a new comer
Then, drugs and MAC-10s
Hugs from fake friends, make ends they hate you
Be broke -- girls won't date you
That's why I relate to, choke yo' ass out til your face blue
Make you, open the safe too
No matter how you call it (how you call it)
This brolic, alcoholic
Like his weed green'd out, like his brick solid
Distribute to, kids who, take heart like Valentine
Drink Ballantine, all the time
Slugs hit your chest tap your spine, flatline
Heard through the grapevine, you got fucked fo' times
Damn that three to nine, fucked you up for real though
Sling steel slow, as for remorse, we feel no

Time, time for you to die
As I kiss.. your.. ass.. goodnight
Time, for you to die
As I kiss.. your.. ass.. goodnight

Fuck that!
That nigga tryna be on that up and coming shit, FUCK THAT!
I ain’t the type to toot my horn, but toot toot motherfucker! I’m the nicest nigga in the game, man! Face the motherfucking facts man!
You fuckin' with the other side! You can’t see me! You can’t see me! In a fistfight you won’t SEE me nigga!
Sick of this bullshit
Only reason I ain’t naming no names, is so I don't give these  bitch-ass niggas a chance to make a record coming back just to sell a few units

Grab, grab your dick and gets freaky
Buckshot the boots if the bitch look sneaky
Tugging on my dreadlocks, swallowing the bed bugs
Gunshots around the mad blocks

Gunshots to the back from the Big MAC attack
Two all-beef patties, special sauce, who's the boss?
I got the gun and make you ""Jump"" like Kriss Kross
And when I squeeze, nigga please",https://genius.com/The-notorious-big-stickup-lyrics
Can I Get Witcha (Original),Unreleased Songs,1992,"Another day in the ghetto
One look outside I'm already upset, yo
It look about a hundred-and-two
It's?a?Saturday and Biggie?ain't got nothing to do
Uh, I'm?interrupted by a phone ring
Sometimes I wish I never got the motherfucking thing
""Hello hello? Can I speak to Biggie?""
Yo, who dis? ""Taisha"" Yo call back, I'm busy
Why don't ya hit me on the box a little later?
Washed up, got dressed, hits the elevator
Steps out, it's the same old scene
Dope fiend, crack fiend, eyewitness news team
I seen a honey with a butt looking butter soft
I know she looks much better with them clothes up off
Sitting all thick, with the ruby red lipstick
That's the one I got to get with

Can I get witcha, can I get witcha?
Can I get witcha, can I get witcha?
""Why you wanna get with me?""
Cause you got a big B-U-T, T, see
Can I get witcha, can I get witcha?
Can I get witcha, can I get witcha?
""Why you wanna get with me?""
Cause you got a big B-U-T, T

She said ""If I get with you
I gotta get witcha whole hood rat crew, whatcha I think I do?
Sling skins for a living,my name ain't November
This ain't Thanksgiving, you ain't Michael Bivins
Smack it up, flip it, rub it down
Do me baby, I ain't down
My name ain't 2Pac I don't ""Get Around""
You hitting this nigga, how that sound?""
Huh, first of all you got me mixed up with
Somebody ya done slept with, hold up
That's my Neneh Cherry shit, I got something slicker
Let me just sip up on this liquor
All I wanna do is smoke a little chronic
Slam ya like Onyx, and get ya hooked on
This Biggie Smalls phonics, 102
How to squeeze 22's in them Reebok shoes, HUH?

Can I get witcha, can I get witcha?
Can I get witcha, can I get witcha?
""Why you wanna get with me?""
Cause you got a big B-U-T, T, see
Can I get witcha, can I get witcha?
Can I get witcha, can I get witcha?
""Why you wanna get with me?""
Cause you got a big B-U-T, T

I said walk me upstairs, cause I forgot my Phillies
She said ""I don't care, so don't be acting silly""
I knew I had her trapped with my hardcore raps
And it wouldn't take a second before I had her on her back
Pulling back the bra straps, threw on my Silk CD
Cause, ""I wanna get freaky with you""
Lose control on the skins is all I can picture, now I'm about to hit you

Can I get witcha? Oww!
Can I get witcha?
""Why you wanna get with me?""
Cause you got a big B-U-T, uh, hey
Can I get witcha? Uh
Can I get witcha? Hey
Can I get witcha? You big booty bitch, c'mon
Oh, you'se a big booty bitch
And I wanna do, do, do, do, do, do
Woah, woah
Can I get a soul clap?
Soul clap, soul clap
Yo, we buggin' the fuck out in this motherfucker, word
Yo, lemme hear the third verse, yo, that was the end",https://genius.com/The-notorious-big-can-i-get-witcha-original-lyrics

This all a part of staying on top of your game, you dig? You know what I'm sayin'?

That's the question
Uh, uh

If Peter Piper pecked 'em, I bet you Biggie bust 'em
He probably tried to fuck him, I told him not to trust him
Lyrically I dust 'em off like Pledge
Hit hard like sledge-hammers
Bitch with that platinum grammar
I am a diamond cluster hustler, queen bitch, supreme bitch
Kill a nigga for my nigga by any means bitch, murder scene bitch
Clean bitch, disease-free bitch, check it
I write a rhyme, melt in your mouth like M&M's
Roll with the M.A.F.I.A., remember them?
Tell 'em when I used to mess with gentlemen, straight up apostles
Now strictly niggas that jostle
Kill a nigga for the figure, how you figure?
Your cheddar would be better
Beretta inside of Beretta, nobody do it better
Bet I wet ya like hurricanes and typhoons
Got buffoons eating my pussy while I watch cartoons
Sleep 'til noon, rap Pam Grier's here
Baby drinkers beware, mostly Dolce wear
Frank kill niggas' wives for one point five
While you struggle and strive, we pick which Benz to drive
The M.A.F.I.A., you wanna be 'em
Most of y'all niggas can't eat without per diem
I'm rich, I'ma stay that bitch

Duh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh
Duh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh
Duh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh, nuh
Duh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh
Duh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh
Duh-nuh-nuh, I'ma stay that bitch
Stay, duh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh

Duh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh
Uh, ding, ding
Duh-nuh-nuh-nuh

Uhh, who you loving? Who you wanna be hugging?
Roll with niggas that be thugging, bugging
In the Tunnel & Esso's
Sipping espresso, Cappuccino with Nino
On a mission for the lucci creno
I used to wear Moschino, but every bitch got it
Now I rock colorful minks because my pockets stay knotted
C-note after C-note, Frank Boat hold fifteen
Plus the caterer, you think you greater, uh
You niggas got some audacity
You sold a million now you half of me
Get off my dick, kick it bitch
Check my pitch, authentic persona
And I'll still stick your Moms for her stocks and bonds
I got that bomb ass cock, a good-ass shock
With hardcore flows to keep a nigga dick rock
Sipping Zinfandel, up in Chippendales
Shopping Bloomingdale's for Prada bags
Female Don Dada has no problems splitting cream with my team
Shit's straight like 9:15, y'nahmean?
Cruise the diamond district with my biscuit
Flossing my Rolex wrist shit
I kick shit, like a nigga do
Pull a trigger too",https://genius.com/The-notorious-big-queen-b-h-demo-lyrics
If I Should Die Before I Wake (Original Version),Unreleased Songs,1992,"Fuck her, never knew her
Screw her, dump her body in the sewer
Our father, uh-huh

What you?expected?from his next?of kin? (Yeah)
I'm loco bro, but?ain't no Mexican
I got nines in the bedrooms, Glocks in the kitchen
A shotty by the shower if you wanna shoot me while I'm shittin'
Uh, the lesson from the Smith and Wessun is depressin'
Niggas keep stressin', the same motherfuckin' question
How many shots does it take (What?)
To make my heart stop and my body start to shake?
If I should die before I wake

All I want is dough and big booty hoes, ya know?
All I want is dough, big booty hoes, ya know? (Money hoes and clothes)
Funk flow, oh (Blunt smoke coming out the nose is all a nigga knows)
All I want is hoes, you know? Dough, flow (Money hoes and clothes)
All I want is dough and big booty hoes, ya know? (Big booty hoes)
All I want is dough, big booty hoes, ya know?
(Money hoes and clothes is all a nigga knows, uh)

Party and Bullshit,Who’s The Man? (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack),1993,"I was a terror since the public school era
Bathroom passes, cutting classes, squeezing asses
Smoking blunts was a daily routine
Since 13, a chubby nigga on the scene
I used to have the trey-deuce
And the deuce-deuce in my bubblegoose
Now I got the Mac in my knapsack
Lounging black, 
smoking sacks up in Ac's and Sidekicks
With my sidekicks rocking fly kicks
Honeys want to chat
But all we wanna know is where the party at
And can I bring my gat?
If not, I hope I don't get shot
Better throw my vest on my chest, 'cause niggas is a mess
It don't take nothing but fronting for me to start something
Bugging and bucking at niggas like I was duck hunting
Dumbing out, just me and my crew
'Cause all we wanna do is

And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit

Hugs from the honeys, pounds from the roughnecks
Seen my man Sage that I knew from the projects
Said he had beef, asked me if I had my piece
Sure do, two .22s in my shoes
Holler if you need me, love, I'm in the house
Roam and stroll, see what the honeys is about
Moet popping, ho hopping
Ain't no stopping Big Poppa
I'm a Bad Boy
Niggas wanna front, who got your back? (Biggie!)
Niggas wanna flex, who got the gat? (Biggie!)
It ain't hard to tell
 
I'm the East Coast overdose
Nigga you scared you're supposed to
Nigga, I toast ya, put fear in your heart
Fuck up the party before it even start
Pissy drunk, off the Henny and skunk
On some Brand Nubian shit beating down punks

And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit

Bitches in the back looking righteous
In a tight dress, I think I might just
Hit her with a little Biggie 101, how to tote a gun
And have fun with Jamaican rum
Conversation, blunts in rotation
My man Big Jock got the Glock in his waist and
We're smoking, drinking, got the hooker thinking
If money smell bad, then this nigga Biggie stinking
Is it my charm? I got the hookers eating out my palm
She grabbed my arm and said ""Let's leave calm""
I'm hitting skins again
Rolled up another blunt, bought a Heineken
Niggas start to loc out, a kid got choked out
Blows was thrown and a fucking fight broke out
(Music stops
Indecipherable sounds of people yelling and arguing
Biggie breaks it up yelling ""Yo, chill, man, chill!"")
Can't we just all get along?
So I can put hickies on her chest like Little Shawn
Get her pissy drunk off of Dom Pérignon
And it's on, and I'm gone
That's that...

And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
