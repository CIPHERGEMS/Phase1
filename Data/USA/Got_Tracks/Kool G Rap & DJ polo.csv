On the Run (Clean),Live and Let Die,1992.0,"You be careful crossin the street
Hey mister, you forgot your things, hey mister

I got a job with the mob, makin g’s
Doin some pickups, deliveries and transportin keys
Yeah they got me like a flunkie money
I’m drivin' around with ten kilos inside my trunk g
And I’m holdin the suitcase
With a half a million dollars on my lap in front of my face
And I’m tryin to ignore it
But sometimes I get tempted to go dip and make a run for it
The thought alone makes me shiver, damn
What if I get caught? they’ll find me floatin in the hudson river
But if I escape, I’ll be in shape for my life
But they might, get my kid and my wife
See I’m supposed to make a stop
To an uptown spot, run up the block and make another drop
But I got somethin else in mind
So at the next stop sign I pull out and load up the nine
I got the money and the hit
Went through the brook nonstop cause 
I ain’t droppin off a block of it
Then I thought of a plan
So I drove to my house and got my girl and my little man
C’mon baby, pack your stuff, get ready
Damn, why your face all sweaty?
Just hurry up, don't throw no fits
I’m a dead man walking, understand, we gotta split
I switched the locks on the door
Started packin gucci bags like I was goin on a world tour
Grabbed the luggage and the gun
C’mon we gotta go, you gotta brother on the run

Mobster: They gotta the shipment
Don: What?
Mobster: They got the whole shipment
Don: I want that son of a bitch dead, I don't care....

Now I’m drivin and I’m lookin at my passport
I’m outta here soon as I hit Kennedy Airport
Loaded the other automatic
I don’t believe this, I'm like a sitting duck stuck in traffic
I’m gettin nervous as hell g
A lincoln continental pullin right up beside me
Puts down my girl and then I bent low
Bullets are flying through my window
The enemy is on attack
Drew the nine and cocked the hammer and I fired at the guinea's back
I gotta take my respect
My bullets hittin crazy mafia members in the neck
Looked at my girl, a bullet struck her
Put in another clip, cause I ain’t givin up nothin my brother
Hit me rollin up in trenches
Sprayin at my car, only missin me by little inches
Stepped on the gas pedal, how bad my girl is harmed?
Man they only hit her in the upper arm
Now I’m drivin off sidewalks, makin sharp turns
My son is in the back catching heartburns
I got the car shakin' wildly
I made a turn, and then I then I ditched the bimmer in a dark alley
They drove right past, now all this chasin stuff is done
Yeah they got a brother on the run

Don: I want Him dead!
I want his family dead!
I want his house burnt to the ground!

The next thing I know, it was daylight
And I been sleepin with the engine running all night
I started pullin on my ho
What man what? wake up stupid, we gotta go!
Pulled out the alley, then I dipped
Looked down and picked up the nine and put more rounds in the clip
You know I’m headin south no doubt
Don’t care about my whereabouts, as long it’s a hideout
Finally we crossed the border, I pulled into a station
To fill up the tank, and get a drink of water
Pullin over to park my ride
That’s when I noticed this limousine comin up on my left side
Then the sucker started rammin' me
Then I looked, it was the Luciano family
Looked at my girl she started cryin, my finger on the trigger
Pulled it- bullets started flyin
Now I’m hittin all them bastards
I’m droppin em fast, while I blast the blood splashes
Then I finally done it
I took em all out, but I caught one in the stomach
Now I’m lookin for survivors
So I ran up on the side of the car, and hit the driver
And then I laid low
Catchin' breath the only one left was Don Luciano
So I snuck up on the sucker
Put my gun to his head, whassup now motherfucker?
He said, wait, I want to talk
(three gunshots) I put his brains on the sidewalk
Another life I had to waste
He fell on his back, and then I spit right in his guinea face
He saw the barrel of the devil’s gun
Now they no longer got a brother on the run",https://genius.com/Kool-g-rap-and-dj-polo-on-the-run-clean-lyrics
Rhyme Tyme,Rated XXX,1987.0,"{Marley Marl:}
Ladies and gentlemen
Back by popular demand
We got Kool G Rap and Polo
Singin it is now
Rhyme Tyme
{Kool G Rap:}
I be funky to a junkie cause the rhyme is dope
I use my microphone wire like a cowboy rope
So I can lasso any rapper that think they can cope
And the microphone is my horror-scope
Magnificient and excellent cause I'm no scrub
I could rock in a club with only one light bulb
All I need is a mic and a crowd to react
And I'll turn a damn jam into Radio Shack
All suckers in a place I'll erase and replace
Just in case you wanna copy and trace
My word is superb, intoxicates like herb
Orally, musically, and mentally disturbed
Soundwaves are outrageous
I'm brave and courageous
Fillin up pages for ages and ages
Released to rock, too acquiesced to shock
All biters get writer's block
When it's rhyme tyme
To play this game you gotta be a rap pro
It's not dominos or tic tac toe
It's the rhyme tyme game, it challenges the brain
Strategy is the key to unlock the chain
My lips do not chat when I start to rap
Project my voice so loud, my tonsils flat
Excellence defense on the phonograph
Is DJ Polo, he's cooler than Shaft
Fresher than a item that you find inside a deli
Fatter than the man that they call the Fonzarelli
Colder than a icey, hotter than chili
Rap in every language, I can say it in Suaheli
My body has a flavor, girls says I'm lickable
Daffy Duck-MC's call it despicable
I say it's similar to fat, incredible
I got a taste, but it's not edible
I'm goin down as a MC champ
Kinda wet on the set, but it's just damp
Some day you'll see my face on a US stamp
Like Evil Knievel I jump and I ramp
In my rap I'm like an other Johnny Dangerously
I can do two things simultaneously
I can rap real fast and speed it up, and not a word you'll miss
I can slow -  down - at - times - just - like - this
I can rap, stop - start it again
Then count to ten
With a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
So there, my friend
I can box, do karate, or even do judo
Rap in spanish, but I'm not Menudo
Ask me why I classify
My rhymes will terrify
It's rhyme tyme
Now I could rap to your sister
Or rap a tongue twister
Those who wanna bite it, it makes your lip blister
Cause I'm the guidin light, I recite on the mic
For parasites who bite it's gonna be frightnight
Mighty microphone phantom, my rhymes are fiery
Because of biters I write em in my diary
So don't dare, my idea is ideal
Polo is on the wheels of steel for real
??? this division the like micanician
What I wrote is voted unanymous decision
Eardrums are struck when he conducts a cut
If a sucker deejays, he gives an uppercut
Just like a dog Kool G Rap will train
Every bitin MC that went insane
At the top I will maintain
I'm not a lamebrain
I leave a bloodstain to show I give pain
Not a skinny dipper, a fat rolly-polly
My hair is very curly, it's like a ravioli
I'm very good at physic, and also scientific
My rappin has a meanin just like a hieroglyphic
The rhyme is very hot, you gotta blow on it to bite it
Sometimes I just recite it, but usually I write it
Girls make me grow just like Pinocchio
Before the show I go: ""Geronimo!""
Makin a video inside the studio
Never had the chicken pocks, the measels, mumps or polio
And you'll be sorry when you bite what I create
You say to yourself: ""i shoulda had a v-a""
Like the mayor I'm a ???, love Pina Colada
In Copacabana with cherry and banana
Captivate your mind at the drop of a dime
My name is Kool G Rap and it's rhyme tyme",https://genius.com/Kool-g-rap-and-dj-polo-rhyme-tyme-lyrics
Road to the Riches,Road To The Riches,1989.0,"When I was five years old, I realized there was a road
At the end, I will win lots of pots of gold
Never took a break, never made a mistake
Took time to create 'cause there's money to make
To be a billionaire takes hard work for years
Some nights I shed a tear while I said my prayers
Been through hard times, even worked part-time
In a Key Food store sweepin' floors for dimes
I was sort of a porter takin' the next man's orders
Breakin' my back with a shack for headquarters
All my manpower for four bucks an hour
Took my time and wrote rhymes in the shower
Shoes are scuffed 'cause the road gets rough
But I'mma rock it 'cause my pockets ain't stuffed enough
All the freaks wouldn't speak 'cause my checks were weak
They would turn the other cheek, so I started to seek
A way to get a play, and maybe one day
I'll be performin' up a storm for a decent pay
No matter how it seems, I always kept the dream
All the girlies screamed and suckers get creamed
Dreamed about it for five years straight
Finally, I got a break to cut my first plate
The road ain't yellow and it ain't no witches
My name is Kool G Rap, I'm on the Road To The Riches

I used to stand on the block sellin' cooked up rock
Money bustin' out my sock 'cause I really would clock
They were for kind of fiends bringin' jackets and jeans
Magazines, anything just to hustle up beans
The cash was comin' fast, money grew like grass
People hungry for the blast that don't even last
Didn't wanna be involved but the money will get ya
Gettin' richer and richer, the police took my picture
But I still supplied, some people I knew died
Murders and homicides for bottles of suicide
Money, jewelry, livin' like a star
And I wasn't too far from a Jaguar car
In a small-time casino, the town's Al Pacino
For all of the girls, the pretty boy Valentino
I shot up stores and I kicked down doors
Collected scars from little neighborhood wars
Many legs I broke, many necks I choked
And if provoked, I let the pistol smoke
Loyal members in a crew now down with the game
Sellin' nickels and dimes in sunshine or rain
What I had was bad, from my shoes to my pad
In the first time in my life, loanin' money to dad
Now the table's turned and my lifestyle switches
My name is Kool G Rap, I'm on the Road To The Riches

A thug will mugs for drugs, he eventually bugs
Lookin' for crack on carpets and rugs
The squealers tells but the dealer still sells
Little spoiled kids inheritin' oil wells
I was the type on the opposite side
Of smokin' the pipe, in a beef I got hype
'Cause rags to riches switches men to witches
Become stitches, body bags in ditches
Bloodshed, I painted the town red
People fled as I put a dread's head to bed
That means dead, in other words deceased
Face got erased, bullets got released
Bombs were planted and kids were kidnapped
In fact, this was a way to get back
At enemies who tried to clock G's
On my block, now they forever knock Z's
Plans of rampages went for ages
Some got knocked and locked inside cages
Some bit the dust for crumbs and crusts
In God we trust, now rots to rust
Bust caps to cops, policeman drops
They blew off his top when the pistol went pop
Troopers, soldiers, rollin' like boulders
Eyes of hate and their hearts get colder
Some young male put in jail
His lawyer so good, his bail is on sale
Lookin' at the hourglass, how long can this power last?
Longer than my song but he already fell
He likes to eat hearty, party
Be like John Gotti, and drives a Maserati
Rough in the ghetto, but in jail he's Jello
Mellow, yellow fellow, tell or hell, hello
One court date can turn an outlaw to an inmate
The judge states, ""Ship him upstate, by the Great Lakes""
And than a-wait and wait and wait
Until he breaks, that's all it takes
So he fakes to be a man, but he can't stand
On his own two feet because now he's in a new land
Rules are different and so is life
When you think with a shank, talk with a knife
Not my lifestyle, so I made a U-turn
The more money I earn, more money to burn
Pushin' all buttons, pullin' all switches
My name is G Rap, I'm on the Road To The Riches",https://genius.com/Kool-g-rap-and-dj-polo-road-to-the-riches-lyrics
Talk Like Sex,Wanted: Dead Or Alive,1990.0,"""Can't ya diggit, Honey?""
""Rated XXX""

For the ladies, one hundred and ninety-five pounds of beef
Chinky eyes, curly hair, and gold teeth
Swinging with this here stud, you need practice
I'm leaving floods of blood on your mattress
I'll leave you holding your swollen backside and rolling
Filling all three holes just like bowling
Don't ask me what the price is
But it's more than your battery-operated devices
And I come fully equipped
With a temperature adjustment to heat up the tip
For demonstrations, watch me slam her
You'll notice the sound of steady pounding
Like a jackhammer
 once on it, you can't cop out
I'm pounding you down until your eyeballs pop out
I'm not your ordinary playa
Because you'll leave in a wheelchair, dear, after I lay ya
Get a grip on your headboard and hold on to it
Or get sent right through it
Bite your nipples when I lick 'em
Not gentle when I stick 'em, huh
I'll leave 'em lookin' like a rape victim
Any girl who steps to it
Ends up getting their stomach pumped like Rod Stewart
I do a damn good job
That's why -
Chicks are on my dick like a human shish kebab
Only nineteen and over permitted
No matter how much young girls want to be with it
You ain't ready for the bed
You still got a pussy like Isaac Hayes' head
Come back in five years
When you grow some hairs and when ya started drinking beers
I'm hitting hookers by the dozen
Making you wetter cause I fuck better than your husband
Giving your girl back spasms
Cause G Rap has 'em - orgasm after orgasm
Change the sheets? You must be kidding
You got to change the whole box spring, I ain't bullshitting
You get hit with hysteria
Cause I'm a bury a big one inside your private area
All hell is in your tush
When Kool G. Rap push pushes inside the bush
Another homegirl flinches
But I got inches for all you little wenches
The letter G is better when it comes to letter X
And I'm a talk like sex
Rated XXX

""Can't ya diggit, Honey?""
""Rated XXX""

Some say that I'm nasty plus
Hookers are mad because they can't outlast me
Girl, you ain't too small
Cause I turn your grip to one size fits all
So if you're still confused when I'm screwing
Let me explain to you exactly what I'm doing
Exploring your body like a biologist
Inventing new ways just like a scientist
Tagging my name on your buns just like a printist
While I'm hurting your ass just like a dentist
You're so wild, I feel like I'm a zoologist
Stretching your shit more than a gynecologist
I'm a twist your ass to death, miss
And when you piss, you'll see more stars than an astrologist
G Rap is hot-blooded, freaking horny
Far from corny, come and jump on me
I'm not small at all, I won't break down or stall
I drive your ass up the wall
Nuts and everything are well in shape
Only thing missin' on my dick is a cape
Let's get together, honey, you never know what's next
And I'm a talk like sex
Rated XXX

""Can't ya diggit, Honey?""
""Rated XXX""

Big girls try to squash me
But I think with my dick, honey, so come and brainwash me
Hit the sack cause I ain't joking
Cause when I start pumping shit up, I leave it smoking
So you better hold on tight all right
Cause my dick is a brown stick of dynamite
I stick a chick and it kills her
I'm probably related to Long Dong Silver
But it gets gooder and gooder
Every time I grab a hooker and I put her on my frankfurter
Kiss your breasts to your navel and then I skip
Cause the only thing I'm licking is your ass with a whip
And it's a real freaky scene
I'm hitting girls with their heads in a guillotine
Why, certainly I'm squirting
I bust a nut and get up and wipe my dick on your curtain
Pushing your head to the pillow
And giving more pleasure than a double-headed dildo
A big ass gets me hardened
But I fuck bitches with titties like Dolly Parton
Time or place doesn't matter to me, sweety
I'll fuck you on the ""A"" train while I write graffiti
In a restaurant, taking you straight to heaven
In a cab or the back of 7-11
Whether you're white and the music you like is rock
You can come and get some hip-hop cock
Consider this dick on your clitoris but never try to flex
Cause I'mma talk like sex

Erase Racism,Wanted: Dead Or Alive,1990.0,"Yo V, bring that beat in
Yeah that's aight
Ahhh man!
Yo G, yo Kool G, yo
I'm doin this right here
We got Big Daddy Kane over there
We all gonna do just one part
Because you know, we came a long way
You know, from back in Martin Luther King days, Malcolm X
 You know, now now that we see
Nelson N-Nelson Mandela's free
We gonna talk about this, is e gonna talk about this racism
Stop that, you know what I'm sayin, we gonna stop that
So G, why don't you just do your rhymin part, and then I'll come on after you

I'm tryin hard to explore, I'm not sure
What all the racial war for
It's makin me more sore
I walk through a color blind corridor
Seekin, for peace in the people I'm meetin
Black white and Puerto Rican men are greetin each other
Just like brothers, there's plenty and many of others
You can discover, kids fathers and mothers
A meltin pot, no one felt they got prejudice
Listen I could never assist someone diss this
A landscape, with a dark and a light handshake
Havin fun, without one bein a fake snake
So let's form a rainbow over the mountain
And let's drink from the same water fountain
Let's make our Earth Day a story of
People that walk through the same territories
Color or creed, is no need for a man to bleed
I beleive, we all breathe the same seed
Unless it's diluted, for somethin to intrude it
Then I see your family tree was uprooted
So don't be foolish if you're Jewish or Hindu
The racial manual is the evil that men do
I was raised in a nation of Asian
Hate shouldn't separate Jamaican from Haitian
So if you're givin in your ears I hope your hear me and
Siberian's no better than Nigerian
I bring a rattle to a battle that you see me in
I'm no villain so why would I be killin Indians
My nationality's reality
And yo a prejudiced man is of a devil mentality
These are words of a wise man, wisdom
Take a taste and erase the racism

The ink is black, the page is white
Together we learn how to read and write
People are black, got people that's white
Let's stop racism, and, let's unite

[Yo yo Kane, why don't you do your part
And then let me do mine and then we get outta here
Go ahead, bet]
In the days of slavery
Some got to run away and many got done away
Inferiority is what some men say
But that shit played out with Kunta Kinte
Then again in the streets of New York
I think of Yusef Hawkins, and I see you'e still stalkin
And when I think of barriers like Bensonhurst
Huh, notice how I mentioned hearse
We got to better this world of prejudice
People, make peace, and learn to live equal
Cause I don't look at myself as a
Coon or a mooley that would have to say massa
You better believe that I'm an asiatic descendant
And I know what's been amended and intended
So let's fulfill and get real, and try to build
A united nation, eliminate segregation
I know there's different strokes for different folks
But I've also acknowledged what hatred provokes
So don't hate me or try to underrate me
Cause I collect ends drive a Benz and live greatly
And we can all live together in harmony
Without thinkin what color is harmin me
If I'm a slave I'm a slave to the rhythm
To E-R-A-S-E the racism


To the black and the white
The red and the yellow
To all the nationalities
I'd like to say hello
And I hope they stop racism and it's comin from our hearts
Me, Kool G Rap, Polo, Big Daddy Kane, Cool V, and of course
The Diabolical Bizmarkie I hope ya stop racism
Peace!",https://genius.com/Kool-g-rap-and-dj-polo-erase-racism-lyrics
Ill Street Blues,Live and Let Die,1992.0,"Aw yeah, word up, word to mother. Here comes G. Rap with another one y'all
We going to swing this like this...

I'm right in front of my front steps thinking of a plan
Looking like Raggedy Ann, no dough in hand, kicking a can
Thinking of a plot to pull some bank in
Because I'm dead and stinking
Soles on my shoes winking, t-shirt is shrinking
Soon I see some thighs and my eyes open wide quick
Who's that with you, chick? Bill Blass my sidekick
What's up, black? Give his hand a smack
Then up pulls a Cadillac, yo baby we'll be back
Jumped right on inside, not too many people saw us
Thinking about who gotta get robbed because the mob got a job for us
The drove us down to this other section
Of town where the clowns there be paying for protection
They want us to send a message to Jimmy the bartender
Lend a friend the money, next you're ripping off his car fenders
He's coming up short cause he snorts
Coke, dope, nope, and hope he don't get caught
He owes some Benjamin Franklins, every last bit of em
But Jimmy's pockets are empty, so now we gotta get rid of him
But Jimmy's wife is with him and they don't want to involve her
Hopped out the back seat they gave me a revolver
Blass, you distract him while I go and whack him
Entered through the back side of the bar and then attacked him
He's screaming for his life, reaching for his wife
Shot him in the back of the head and shanked him with a knife
And that goes for anybody who's gotta pay they dues
You lose, cause I got the Ill Street Blues

You lose, cause I got the Ill Street Blues (x4)

Suckers I clobber, because my town is full of cops and robbers
You're not promised tomorrow in this Little Shop of Horrors
So I got to get with the business and hit quick
Moneygrip's pocket's looking thick so I stick slick
Hold it right there, hands in the air, I know you got the loot
Or better yet, face down on the ground, empty your pockets troop
Hit the deck, I got the Tec right on your neck
And I expect to make a buck to heck with a traveler's check
But if a vic' tries to choke me
I'll have to smoke him like I'm Smokey the Bear, so okie dokie
Goodbye, or bon voyage, have a good journey
Don't even try begging for your life, that don't concern me
So to the next weasel that freezes
Your begging and your pleases only getting ya closer to meeting Jesus
Yeah, I shake a schmuck just to make a buck
Then I break a duck and if the duck gotta get bucked then I don't give a fuck
Hyper as a sniper piping niggas like a plumber
Cold vicking and sticking up the ones that run the numbers
Or even a bigger score, the lady in the liquor store
Go inside then kick in the door, pull her then I'm stickin her for
Money or your life, honey hurry and choose
But you lose, because I got the Ill Street Blues

You lose, cause I got the Ill Street Blues (x4)

Extra extra read all about it in the papers
The boss tried to rape us, so we tossed him off the skyscraper
Because he pulled some other people to try and hit us
Get us, but none of them did us, he must be trying to kid us
But that's dead, I'll thank God in the red, 'cross the bread borders
So nobody can short us, he fled down to headquarters
Ready to put some work in, we're not a lazy crew, we'll do a job or two
But yo, the man can't even stick me with some Krazy Glue
Ready to tore him even more because she saw him
We took out all the lookouts in the front and kicked his door in
What's up snake, why'd you violate?
They called him a  chazer (What's that?)
Yo, that's a pig that don't fly straight
Getting ready to jab him, I grabbed him by the necktie
Homie tried to get fly, and swing I gave him a decked eye
You know the evil that men do, hell is where the men go
We snatched him by his hands and feet and threw him out the window
Up, up, and away cause I don't play, clown
Buck, buck, buck, take that with you on the way down
I'm hoping you got springs and wings on your shoes
But you lose, because I got the Ill Street Blues

You lose, cause I got the Ill Street Blues (x4)",https://genius.com/Kool-g-rap-and-dj-polo-ill-street-blues-lyrics
Streets of New York,Wanted: Dead Or Alive,1990.0,"In the streets of New York
Dope fiends are leaning for morphine
The tv screens follow the homicide scenes
You live here, you’re taking a chance
So look and I take one glance, there’s a man inside an ambulance
Crowds are getting louder, I wonder how the
People want to go fight for the white powder
People hanging in spots
They waited until the blocks got hot and got raided by the cops
I’ll explain the man sleeping in the rain
His whole life remains inside a bottle of Night Train
Another man got his clothes in a sack
Cause he spent every dime of his rent playing blackjack
And there’s the poor little sister, she has a little baby daughter
Named Sonya and Sonya has pneumonia
So why’s her mother in a club pulling zippers?
Yo that’s her job, Sonya’s mommy is a bar stripper
Drug dealers drive around looking hard
Knowing they’re sending their brothers and sisters to the graveyard
Every day is a main event, some old lady limps
The pushers and pimps eat shrimps
It gets tiring, the sound of a gun firing
Then there's desire for the sound of a siren
A bag lady dies in an alleyway
She’s seen the last of her days inside the subways
More and more down the slope, the kid couldn’t cope
So he stole somebody’s dope and a gold rope
Now my son’s on the run, he’s a wanted one
Who had fun then was done by a shotgun
Upstairs I cover my ears in tears
The man downstairs must have drank too many beers
Cause every day of his life he beats his wife
Till one night she decides to pull a butcher knife
Blind man plays the sax
A tune called “The Arms on My Moms Show Railroad Tracks""
Many lives are cut short
That’s when you’re living, in the streets of New York


Baby needs new shoes
But his papa uses all the money for booze
A young girl is undressed in the back seat of a caddy
Calling some man daddy
Three men slain inside an apartment
All you could see was the sparks when it darkened
Daylight broke, cops roll on the scene
The drug war, daily routine
Gambling spots, just a poor man’s jackpot
You winning a lot, you get shot
The drug dealing fanatics, but you don’t want no static
Cause they got crack addicts with automatics
Shoot-outs for a desire for territory
A kid got caught in the crossfire
A tired mother can’t take no more
She grabbed a bottle full of sleeping pills and took about 24
Human beings are laying on the pavement
Cause they’re a part of a mental enslavement
The cop snipers, little babies in dirty diapers
This type of life is making you hyper
People scouting a torched-out building
And got killed when the cold air filled in
Is hell really suggested?
No more persons arrested, a child molested
A little kid says ""Yo, I got a color tv, cd player and car stereo
And all I want is a castle, I also got a .38, don’t give me no hassle""
One kid heads straight for the top
And gets stopped and popped by a crooked cop
Look behind you when you walk
That’s how it is in the streets of New York",https://genius.com/Kool-g-rap-and-dj-polo-streets-of-new-york-lyrics
Men at Work,Road To The Riches,1989.0,"Yo G Rap
Since we didn't make no records in a long time
Why don't you show these rap sap suckers what kind of rhymes you got
Money

Deadly rhymes, here's the solution
Smoking so bad, I'mma cause a pollution
With satisfaction, bad assassin, fatal attraction
Chop you to an improper fraction
Ill insanity, kill like Amity-
Ville horror, as I wipe out humanity
Won't leave a path, a track, a trail to trace
But when you're staring inside of a mirror, you see my face
And I'll terrify, so don't ever try
To shake or bake or flake cause I never fry
Letters together sly as a fox clever than ever
Silly ducks write rhymes with feathers
Really no needles are needed to inject this
Dope cause I'm a death wish - not even Bob Hope's
Rhymes are rugged, soul flooded, cold blooded
You ain't better, you're butter, so just shut it
Here to perform, having a brainstorm, make a rain form
Hot rap groups run to keep the name warm
Putting heads to beddy-bye like Freddy so get ready
Cause I'mma get crazier than Crazy Eddie
I'm alone but my tone is a sharp tune
Developing pictures in your brain like a darkroom
Rappers are captured and tortured with rapture
In 3-D is a G coming at you
Words in my rap will surprise you like Cracker Jacks
You dig them like Sugar Smacks and bite them like Apple Jacks
Brother, sister, misses or mister
My style is complicated, patterns like a twister
FOES, my shadow grows when I walk slow
Nerds are scared to be heard so they talk low
But I've been urging to drill in your brain like a surgeon
Rhymes so dope and they're busting you up like a virgin
More competitors change to challenger
You need to talk into a mic with a silencer
My defeat is like a mission impossible
My brain is unexplained, not illogical
Therefore I'm passing bait to assassinate
Busting your ass so fast, it'll fascinate
You try to duplicate to get up to date
Can't wait to be my pen pal or paper mate
The innovator with greater data, deeper than a crater
Of course, Polo's the boss of the crossfader
The rage is on, my rhymes are airborne
Stage is torn to wreck, my murdering gear's on
Moving a head, never bled inside a bloodshed
Nothing is said, instead heads are dead
G Rap manages styles, taking all the advantages
Putting sucker rappers in bandages
I got a plot so hot it'll tan
I might be cool but I'm far from a fan
Letting you know how it is in show biz
Give me a quiz and I'mma a show you a G wiz
Bright as Einstein, brighter than sunshine
Rhymes will intoxicate like moonshine
Total disaster the broadcaster master
Blaster as the tempo goes faster
Sparks shoot out from the mic when I rhyme ignites
All types of words I write, put in flight
Rappers evaporate to vapor
I drop science on paper and then build a skyscraper
When I die, scientists will preserve my brain
Donate it to science to answer the unexplained
But as long as I inhale and exhale
I challenge the next female or the next male
What you hear in your ears all appears to be clear
Consider me fair cause I share ideas
That sticks to the mix, more tricks than a 666
So you better grab a crucifix

Men at work...(x8)

My ideas overload
And the records I make explode in every zip code
Definitely def, the five fingers of death
Doc the Butcher, Polo's the chef
And I'm the waiter cause I serve imitators
Who try to duplicate like an emulator
Try to get paid copying a name brand
If I was Gucci, then you would be Dapper Dan
Now hear the diaper, cause I'm a sniper
You want to get hyper?
Prepare for hyperspace and just flow with the bass
And fall in place, just keep up the pace no time to waste
Just enter the place to see the entertainer
My rhymes keep me fresh like a container
Some rappers said, my rap is dead
Shake your head to my bass like a basehead
There'll be bloodshed in the meat shop
Those who beef get sliced into pork chops
Until your fork stops stabbing my rhymes
From the latest and the greatest of all times
Sleep while you knock Z's, I'mma clock G's
Freeze rap heroes below zero degrees
Rhymes like these will seize enemies
That want to be G, like the Bee Gees
Not rated PG, we break necks
Like sex, rated XXX
Yes, Doc Da Butcher is who I recommend
DJ Polo let the record spin


Construction put on paper
Listen cause I'm building a skyscraper
For a strong foundation of wheels of steel
Not a reel to reel, but the real deal
Polo works the crossfader, he's a bricklayer
And the record player turns like the Himalaya
Doc the Butcher supplies the cement
And the rhymes that I invent is the blueprint
While I'm using my mind to make a design
Polo puts up the Men at Work sign
Yeah, we still building, making a skeleton
One of the sucker MC's just fell again
So take caution if you want to know the truth
I'mma elevate you up to the roof
Listen to the sound, don't dare look down
Cause you're far from the ground
Now you're impressed cause words I manifest
Takes you more higher than cess or Buddha bless
Hard as concrete, the building's complete
Yo Marley Marl, let's stop the breakbeat",https://genius.com/Kool-g-rap-and-dj-polo-men-at-work-lyrics
Truly Yours,Road To The Riches,1989.0,"Yeah here we go, just go with the flow
I wanna say something to this girl I know
She tried to play me out though, check it out

This I dedicate to the girl I hate
It's a piece of my mind rhyme put on a plate
So yo, go ahead swinger, I'm putting up my middle finger
I'm not sad or mad, I don't feel anger
You're not all that fly, trying to play the role
I had girls that looked better on the ho stroll
Working night patrol, ya know what I mean?
I get cash and still wear Jordache jeans
You thought your drug-dealing man was much better
Because he always came and got you in a plush Jetta
Or a Audi, a Benz, or a Jaguar
You didn't think G Rap was going that far
I'm here to tell off, because you thought I fell off
And now if you're riding the tip, just get the hell off
You wanted to leave because you didn't believe that I would achieve
Cause you had something up your sleeve
Perhaps you might have thought I'm a dreamer with a fat head
Now you're stuck with a baby from a crack head
Come to my shows, you want to check it to see if I wreck it
The only record your man got is a jail record
I know you like him a lot because he's a big shot
The only picture you got is his mug shot
I'm on a label with well-known singers in it
Look, your man's getting booked and fingerprinted
Polo drives a Benz from state-to-state
By the way, guess who made his license plates
Thought I was finished, down, going through the blues
Here's a hundred dollars, go buy some new shoes
Go ahead good looking, you can keep booking
From my recital I'll never get my title tooken
So you got a little 9 to 5, so what?
What do you do for a living, slice cold cuts?
You look slick, but you know every Tom and Dick
You're more quick than a chick from a porno flick
While you scrub floors, I go on tours
From me, G Rap, yo, truly yours
(Yo G man! You should diss her man. Yo I heard he's a homo anyway)

Listen up money, or should I say honey?
You're looking more sweeter than a Playboy bunny
Fingernails filed, your hair is styled
And the gear that you wear looks hot and wild
Everybody says is he, some kind of sissy?
Your name was ""Moose"" but now they call you ""Missy""
Night or day lights, you fight for the gay rights
I thought you would stay bright, but you wanna play fight
With men, and Len, your real close friend
But you wouldn't be his friend if his knees didn't bend
You're not a lady dear, you're a square and a queer
Barrettes in your hair, bamboos in your ear
Running to cars, hanging out in gay bars
Winking your eyes to guys that wear bras
Skintight Levi's and even knee-highs
Don't try to lie, sugar, I know why
In the ladies bathroom, spraying on perfume
Stuffing your t-shirt with two balloons
You don't think about the opposite sex at all
Instead of sugar walls, you'd rather have the balls
Way back in the days, you was as big as a cow
But look at you now, at jams you say ""Ow!""
A sex disease was as common as TB
But gays today get VD in 3-D
And that is called AIDS in case you didn't know
And the only blow I'm giving is this knockout blow
Switching with your bandana looking like Diana Ross
From me G Rap, yo, truly yours
(Hey yo, finish dissing that girl, man)

Yo, do me a favor, and pick up a pen and pad
And try to write down the numbers of the men you've had
So remember when you're putting someone else in check
Go to the Wizard of Oz and get some self-respect
Won't say no names, it might leave a permanent scar
I don't have to go that far, you know who you are
And if you don't, then everybody else does
Cause all the fellas be telling me how good you was
I can't accept a girl with a ruined rep
I'm like a chef, I just cook up the stew and step
Off with her clothes, like Moby Dick, there she blows
She wanna throw like the girls from the peep shows
Your man was large, but now he's getting kinda tiny
And you run up behind me trying to get pregnant by me
And in a year, I bet you'll be on welfare
Don't cry for help dear, you put yourself there
The way it looks, you'll end up in Playboy books
While your man is in Manhattan snatching pocket books
Bugging and mugging with a big 12 gauge
Starving so bad I can see his ribcage
Yo, you used to tell me all the time you're gonna be a model
Later in life, you're living in a crack bottle
So when you're begging on your knees because I'm clocking G's
You'll be in zero degrees getting processed cheese
Wearing dungarees, yo baby I don't need a girl with broken hands
Cause her man's a woman beater
So when you getting sores from giving up your drawers
Remember Kool G Rap said truly yours

Yo, I don't even know why you tried to play me honey
Now I'm down with Warner Brothers getting Bugs Bunny money
(Word, now you wild females know how G rap lives...)",https://genius.com/Kool-g-rap-and-dj-polo-truly-yours-lyrics
On the Run,Live and Let Die,1992.0,"I got a job with the mob, makin G's
Doin some pickups, deliveries and transportin keys
Yeah they got me like a flunky
I'm ridin around with ten kilos inside my trunk G
And I'm holdin the suitcase
With a half a million dollars right in my motherfuckin face
And I'm tryin to ignore it
But sometimes I get tempted to make a motherfuckin run for it
The thought alone makes me shiver, damn
What if I get caught? They'll find me floatin in the Hudson river
But if I escape, I'll be in shape for my life
But they might, get my kid and my wife
See I'm supposed to make a stop
To an Uptown spot, run up the block and make another drop
But I got somethin else in mind
Cause I'm sick of puttin my motherfuckin ass on the line
I got the money and the hit
Went through the Brook nonstop cause I ain't droppin off shit
Then I thought of a plan
So I droves to my house and got my girl and my little man
C'mon bitch, pack the shit, get ready
""God damn why your face all sweaty?""
Just hurry up and get the shit
I'm a dead man, bitch. Understand? We gotta split!
I switched the locks on the door
Started packin like I was goin on a motherfuckin world tour
Grabbed my bags and my gun
C'mon we gotta go... I'm on the motherfuckin run

Now I'm drivin and I'm lookin at my passport
I'm outta here soon as my ass hit the airport
I loaded up the automatic
I don't believe this shit, I'm stuck in motherfuckin traffic
I'm gettin nervous as a fuck see
A Lincoln Continental pullin right up beside me
Puts down my bitch and then I bent low
*gunfire, breaking glass* Bullets are flying through my window
The enemy is on attack
Drew the nine and cocked the hammer and I fired at the bitches back
I gotta take my respect
My bullets hittin italian motherfuckers in the neck
Looked at my bitch a bullet struck her
Put in another clip, cause I ain't givin up a motherfucker
Niggas runnin up in trenches
Sprayin at my car, only missin me by fuckin inches
Stepped on the gas pedal, how bad my bitch is harmed?
Shit they only hit her in the fuckin arm
Now I'm drivin off sidewalks, makin sharp turns
My son is catchin motherfuckin heartburns
I got the car shakin wildly
I made a turn, and then I dipped my shit into a dark alley
They drove right past, now all this chasin shit is done
I'm on the motherfuckin run

The next thing I know, it was daylight
And I been sleepin in this motherfucker all night
I started pullin on my ho
""C'mon, man, what?"" Wake up bitch, we gotta go!
Pulled out the alley, then I dipped
Looked down and picked up the nine and put more rounds in the clip
You know I'm headin South no doubt
And I don't give a fuck where, as long it's a hideout
Finally we crossed the border, I pulled into a station
To fill up the tank, and get a drink of water
Pullin over to park my ride
That's when I noticed this limousine comin up on my left side
Then the sucker started rammin me
Then I looked, it was the Luciano family
Looked at my bitch she started cryin, my finger on the trigger
I pulled it—bullets started flyin
Now I'm hittin all them bastards
I'm droppin em fast, splashin blood out niggas' asses
Then I'm finally done and
I took em all out, but I caught one in the stomach
Now I'm lookin for survivors
So I ran up on the side of the car, and hit the driver
And then I laid low
The only motherfucker left was Don Luciano
So I snuck up the sucker
Put my gun to his head, ""Whassup now motherfucker?""
He said, ""Wait, I want to talk""
*four gunshots* I put his brains on the sidewalk
Another life I had to waste
He fell on his back, and then I spit right in his guinea face
He saw the barrel of the devil's gun
Now I'm no longer on the motherfuckin run",https://genius.com/Kool-g-rap-and-dj-polo-on-the-run-lyrics
Fuck U Man,Live and Let Die,2008.0,"Since I made the record 
""Talk Like Sex,""
Bitches are comin' up with their friends for a nigga to hit the skins
Hopin' that Kool G Rap was just makin' rhymes
But I'm leavin' bitches' vaginas with more stitches than Frankenstein
Some even had the nerve to try to give me head
And swallow the whole jimmy to make a nigga fed
But come on you bitches, don't make me laugh;
You couldn't deep throat G Rap if you was a motherfuckin' giraffe
Dag, some even fled when they saw the head
Cuz G's dick would make you seasick fuckin' me in a waterbed
Don't try to play me like no sucker
Cuz these bitches'll be callin' up Dial-a-Mattress like a motherfucker
You heard the song before; you don't wanna see me
""I'll fuck you on the A-train while I write graffiti.""
I'll even fuck you in a taxi cab
And after sex with a nigga you'll be buyin' a box of maxi-pads
Soon as you open your legs
No need for no birth control, bitch, cuz my dick is touchin' the eggs
Kool G Rap, the pussy slammer
Hell, I'd be talkin' fucked up grammar if you was Bad Mamma Jamma
I ain't small, I'll have you cummin' like waterfalls
And then turn them 
sugar walls
 into 
Carnegie Hall
Leavin' my mark on hookers like Zorro
Plus fuckin' bitches so def like there won't be no pussy left tomorrow
Hittin' hoes like it ain't funny
I think about bowls of Cheerios because I want my nuts and honey
Talkin' to all the women that look fine
Pretendin' my prick was Moby Dick and have a whale of a time
Now I'm not a deep-sea diver
But I love it when my dick's covered and smothered with saliva
Shit, might even straighten out your dentures
Because it's not just a blow job, honey, it's an adventure
But 69in', I ain't with that:
I'll go to a Chinese restaurant, bitch, if I wanna eat cats
Because you gotta be brave to eat the tuna, G
So when it comes to pussy-lickin', I'm the chicken of the sea
I should be on the sex channel;
Not a chump cuz I'm givin' punk-bitches better humps than camels
If you're a virgin, I'll make it fit
Because my dick'll pop the cherry and spit out the fuckin' pit
And if you're concerned, my sperm don't burn
And if it did, I'd give that nappy-headed ass a fuckin' perm
Shucks, I instruct a fuckin' lesson
You think it's painless? I hit the anus and fuck up your large intestines
Leavin' you bitches stingin' from the bangin'
My man Jimmy got a hole in his head, but yo, that nigga's still hangin'
Bitch, you'd rather hump a fuckin' whole army
Cuz even the Witness Protection Program couldn't hide this man's salami
You fuck around and catch a seizure
Before I fuck a ho I gots ta put the hooker under anesthesia
Lettin' saliva dribble on your nipple
Orgasms double and triple sit ripple and turn your ass into a gripple
Then I see you searchin' for the swellin'
Cuz I'm-a leave a hole so big your gynecologist might fall the hell in
Got damn! I hit the ham right
Honeybuns, you can ask my Three Sons, 
I got the Dick right out the Van Dyke
I'm fuckin' naked girls with fly rhymes
But don't push me, because that pussy will be runnin' for it's nine lives
I know you hookers can't refuse this
But don't pick me to give no hickeys cuz I'm givin' bitches bruises
Yeah, I'll tear that pussy hole apart
For fuckin' with G Rap after dark, you'd rather jog in Central Park
So if you want kids before I fuck ya
Look at the size of my dick, and you'll adopt the motherfuckers
Shit, bitches get open like a can;
Just leave it up to G Rap, cuz I'm the neighborhood Fuck U Man",https://genius.com/Kool-g-rap-and-dj-polo-fuck-u-man-lyrics

Hit you in the chest with a motherfuckin tec and watch you jump
So die motherfuckers die motherfuckers die
Look deep into the eyes of a killer smokin' fry
One nigga you can't fuck wit

So bring in bodybags when I start bangin
Cause I'm leavin motherfuckers laid out, with they brains hangin
Straight gettin down for mine
And I'll fuck up a bitch, cause I don't mind dyin'
So feel me drill me, put a bullet in my head, but yo
You can't kill me, cause I'm already dead
Scarface goin psycho, yeah

I'm Bushwick Bill, but call me Chuckie

Grip a motherfucker by his neck and gouge his fuckin eyes out
I'm insane by a longshot, hey

Is How You Survive in South Central
Kick the instrumental, run and get your bigger crew
Cause it's Judgment Day, and Ice Cube is Terminigga 2
Pow pow buck buck pow buck
Your name is Stucky Mack, now you realize that you're fucked

Have you droolin like a vegetable, but you're not edible
It's the incredible, buck your ass from head to toe
Audi 5000, don't wait for the Feds to show
Cause they'll have me go up, up the river
Where the white boys'll try to make a nigga
Walk, walk the plank, got the shank, hide the tape
Around the handle, gotta let em know what I stand for
In the chow line, now is the time
See the trustee, walk up from behind
Real quick shank shank, leave his ass red
Motherfucker dead, from two to the head

See where I come from the crime rate only rises
The murderers disguise in all ages shapes and sizes
Bitches picked up and dicked up, niggas they gettin stuck up
Give up what you got, or get your ass shot the fuck up
Run em down and gun em down, yeah that's how we do it
Niggas get killed, and then filled with embalming fluid
Step to the niggas that I'm checkin
Pull out the tec and I reckon you'll get murdered in a second
Bang with the nine, boom with the pound
Motherfuckers are fallin and crawlin on the ground
Snitches get stitches, bitches that act snotty
Inside the parties even the hotties get turned to bodies
Now I heard, they got other places that's similar
But I represent New York, you fuck around I'm killin ya
A whole block of cops patrollin when I'm rollin
And if my pockets are swollen you know somebody's shit got stolen
Yeah you niggas get ripped, when my clip, goes in the
S-M-I-T-H W-E-Double-S-O-N
Or the reliable revolver
And like I said before, it's the motherfuckin problem solver
So bring it on nigga, get brave

"She Loves Me, She Loves Me Not",Road To The Riches,1989,"Ah man
Sad, sad song
Yo word Polo, broken heart ain't no joke, man

Yo, why don't you really tell them how you feel about it
Man...

Love is pain left out in the rain
With nothing to gain but teardrop stains
Being haunted by a memory as I think back
The things we used to do and how we used to act
With love and trust, passion and plussed
Because a pride never kept things inside yo they was always discussed
Between us, never argued about
And I never gave a clue for you to figure it out
How I miss being blessed with your sweet finesse
As we kiss and twist and caress on the mattress
Sweet body heat, your heartbeat
I'll grip your hips and both of our lips will meet so neat
Staring up at the moonlight with someone to hold tight
Given a chance for romance until the sunlight
Brightens the sky, it reflects in your eye
But now, the reflection is gone and I cry out

She loves me, she loves me not
Yo she loves me (x2)
Looking at your picture as it sits on the table
As I put on my cable I wish that I was able
To touch but it's a shame that you had to go
So I watch the hands on the clock go real slow
Gone with the wind, is love a sin?
If it is then God, then bring it back again
Not a girl that you rate as a fine blind date
I need a love mate so I can create
So I open a window to feel the wind blow
Try to figure out how can a love end so
Fast and just pass and not even last
First grow like grass, then shatter like glass
Now I stare at the walls, clock five Tylenols
Unplug the telephone to avoid phone calls
As I sit and crave for the love she gave
But when I wake up, I'm the same love slave
Saying

She loves me, she loves me not
Yo she loves me (x4)
When you lost a good friend, dreams seem to end
Cause broken hearts and men don't blend
So I'm not here to stick every chick I can pick
You move too quick, you become seasick
And a one-night stand is for the one-track mind man
The kind of guy you kick like a can
So I race in space and try to replace the pretty face
But it's a waste, this chase is a kiddy case
Now I whisper how much I missed her
My lips should have blistered the way I kissed her
So soft and slow, laid back and relaxed
And when I move, the groove is as smooth as a sax
She kissed me low and then proceeded up
Bedsheets heated up, the pace is speeded up
Slowly but surely we reach our destiny
She got the best of me and left the rest of me
Now all I got is total confusion
She disappeared and it's not an illusion
My life is bitter, the memories glitter
I feel like dirt, so please do not litter
My heart's deflated, doctors can't rate it
I don't know how the hell I made it
So farewell sweetheart wherever you are
I'll just look at a star, and say yo

She loves me, she loves me not
Yo she loves me (x4)

Rougher than Gotti, in tone
Got a body harder than Flintstone
Your girl got her skins boned
I'm diggin' her down with my skin-tone
It's Brown-er than Bobby 'cause humpin' is my hobby
Down in the endzone, with mens makin' her friends moan
Listen and learn and turn on your tuners
If you looneys try to commence, I break
Bang zoom, like Honeymooners
I don't want singers, but finger snappers
The speaker slapper, the weaker the rapper;
The dapper rapper's when I flap my trapper
Got that ass gassed by Amoco, you know you ain't man to go
Dead up, head up, so I set up to slam a ho
I don't give a heck, but I don't peck on a redneck
You wanna pull cards? You're a dead deck, bed check
Lead from my TEC, come and step up and get your head wrecked
Wait a sec, you comin to see what's left?
I gotta catch my breath
Rappers slayed; like played like Jeff to the left
And none of you nitwits can get with this hip shit
You dipsticks, even miss kiss with no lipstick
I don't run a style, but a mile, gut-bust a child
Big ol' snappy happy rappers smile like Gomer Pyle
Hell, I'm ringin' bells with a ding-dong
I'll play you like ping pong
You're swingin' on my ding-a-ling, King Kong
I pop bad cops, I got a pig-a-day habit
Bing, bing, BING! Just like the Ricochet Rabbit
Grab it, your sound is just like a lady, baby
Maybe you're old as Grady, still in the 80's
Metaphors poorer than Haiti
I pop to the top, now the hip-hop Glock pop rocks
Whenever it drops, I run over rappers at the record shop
You name your best, I'll say ""Who?"" like owls
Pass me a towel, and I'mma move my bowels all over his vowels
Bring ten men, then I'll send my venom in 'em
You ain't gonna win 'em, 'cause he got a woman's momentum
And I don't wanna hear from a square
'Cause one of these niggas just doesn't belong here
My rhymes are like a 9mm Beretta

Finger popped, the better the batter or flipper
You're out of date, you must be the Late Show, I hate, though
Push on the brakes slow, uh-oh! Better get Maaco
Dead on head-on collision, bad decision
You wanna see me, nigga? You better check your vision
It ain't 20/20, money, silly bunny, you're funny
Your ass'll get smashed just like a crash test dummy
Retire, an MC that Oscar Mayer could take
Some of you wacky rappers just play anyway
That's B-O-L-O-G-N-A
So come and swing wild, mild child, and get your style hurt
HEY, HEY, HEY! Shit I say is Fatter than Albert
Play at your own risk if you diss
Got a lotta hot groups turnin' cold
Better go and sip on some Swiss Miss
Inner city, actin' like bitties, you're pussy
So here, kitty kitty, come get some milk from my ho's titties
Cross at the green, not in between, or get hit, G
Red light, green light, one, two, three
Out for the dash, but in a flash, you shoulda let me pass
But crashed, now that ass is in a body-cast
Every time I put out my records and tapes
Motherfuckers go bananas like this was Planet of the Apes
Grapes, I bust 'em like cherries and lay down
Bitches purchase tickets to ride the dick
And sit down on it like a Greyhound
Down with the clowns actin' like killers
As good as wooden soldiers

Back again
What?

This is poison so be alert and cautious
Those who act courageous you will get nauseous
Infected or contaminated
Turn on your stereo never come radio-activated
Deadly and fatal, poison the title
My recital hits the parts that are vital
So tune in the tone of beats and poems
Polo's headphones becomes a skull and crossbones
Pull out your Q-tips, clean out the earwax
If you're still hard of hearing
I'mma scrub them with Ajax
With maximum drum so behave and remember
You're a slave to my sound wave
Faster rhymes I mastermind I have to find
A new method time after time
Write a rhyme quick when I pull out my Bic pen
Stick to an idea, the soundproof slick then
Put it on paper cause I make you hyper
Than any other rapper cause I keep my rapping riper
Like cherries or some say berries
Mandatory for the auditorium's glory
Here's the story: rappers getting leery to hear me
G speaks in a new technique of fury
Combination of drums and noise and
Yo yo yo Polo yo this is poison
Poison! (x3)

Look-alikes on the mic you should get off
You're a rip-off, I'mma rip up, get
Rid of, cause you bit off
Bite off, ate off. Imitate off
They get paid off for G Rap to get laid off
Get up and sit up the butterer and buttercup
Male or female shut them up, Polo shut her up
: Yo, you heard what he said shut the hell up, man
Yeah, hide my line as you pick them up
Rob me blind of my rhymes you might as
Well have said: ""stick 'em up.""
Letters of metaphor matters to
Better the fatter your pocket
Rhymes blast off like rockets
Rhymes will be replaced and beats erased
In case a rapper tries to trace hardcore bass
Made in a minute the sky is the limit
For reaching the goal and the dream
Wouldn't you want to be in it to win
It?
Biters are wanted like animals hunted
Soon as I get them I hit them I done it
To the suckers who fronted
The rappers who made it and did it
Forget about winning the battle cause
I'mma shake rattle and roll
A little something for girls and boys and
Yo yo Polo my man yo this is poison
Read the label sucker
P-O-I-S-O-N yeah, Poison
Poison! (x3)

A mind designed to find a rhyme that's right on time
One step beyond and not behind the line
That separates dogs from divine
Take it as a caution, or a warning sign
Whether antonyms, words I'm blending them
Homonyms, synonyms, good like M&M's
With Polo and while he's slicing
I'll turn the mike's last name into Tyson
My brain is like a factory constantly creating
Material stitch by stitch for decoration
Lyrics are fabrics, beat is the lining
My passion in rhyming is fashion designing
Now it gets odd it, cause people want to sport it
You bought it, if you didn't then you couldn't afford it
Poetry full of surprises, it's like a game show
And my brain glows just like a rainbow
Rappers and poets they already know it
G Rap is a terror not a error and never
Will I stop reaching for better
Whether wheels of steel or reel to reel
G Rap will make you feel the real deal
I usually rap hardcore and I know
That y'all thinking am I somehow semi, so
We yell ""party"" and girls and boys and

Niggas in the street that I dislike
You better get this right
These days what the fuck is a fist fight
Picture me puttin niggas in headlocks
When I can lick off shots, and put they ass in a box
Cause if you steppin to me tryin to throw a right hook
You're just lookin to get your motherfuckin life took
Cause I can't wait to be a niggas fate
So while you lift weights, I'm liftin light ass nickel plates
So if you wanna misbehave nigga
I'll have to kick it to the motherfuckin grave digger
You motherfucker you heard it
Doin all that rope-a-dope shit, nope, your dopey-ass murdered
Niggas'll be the Karate Kid
But I'll be in prison doin a motherfuckin body-bid
So you can take all that Rocky shit home
Sylvester Stallone ain't shit against Al Capone
Cause I ain't got no patience or energy
For motherfuckers and punk-ass suckers that wanna injure me
Step up and play me like I'm soft
Bitch I don't knock motherfuckers out, I'm knockin motherfuckers off
Leavin the scene like Machine Gun Kelly
Two to the head about four across the belly
Steady givin niggas the runs
Fuckin clowns put your fists down and go for your guns

""Alright, on the ground, face down face down on the ground
Get on the ground
Hands behind your head""
""So, so what are you gonna do?
Beat-beat the crap out of me?"" GO!

You punk-ass niggas better hop or chill
Cause my Glock can kill twenty motherfuckers with boxer skills
That's how I put a niggas head out
The murder scene needs more than Visine to get the red out
And I don't give a fuck if you know Judo
Cause I'mma blow your motherfuckin ass to Pluto
And when I blast the trey niggas pass away
Put in the ground til your silly clown ass decay
So all you niggas with the jokes
(Is everybody ready?) 
Well dibbida-dat's all folks
.
Cause nigga you don't want the nine to go (boom)
Niggas like Tyson woulda died a long time ago
Ran outta luck when I struck on you sucker ducks
No uppercuts you'll be another motherfucker bucked
Gettin all rough in scuffed up boots
Hell no, I'm givin motherfuckers burial suits
Your little T.K.O was A.O.K
My way is R.I.P., niggas are D.O.A
Dead on Arrival
So nigga you better come with your gun if you want survival
From the Mac-11
And those are real shots on the motherfuckin track 7
I ain't kickin niggas buns
If it's a bitch I'mma wetta you better go for your guns

""Yo wassup, what the fuck is up now man?
What?
Where my money at man?
Hey yo, yo I told you I'd see you when I see you
Aww man you act like you wanna fight
What what? Yeah yeah alright yeah, I wanna fight"" *BOOM*

Rollin up on niggas wearin wigs
Cause I got a Sig for you nigs and all you motherfuckin pigs
Kool G Rap's a bad decision
Fuck front page I'm puttin niggas on television
I got heart kid if you want we can throw it out
But you ain't got no heart motherfucker when I blow it out
Straight out your back
Cause you got attacked by the mack let's see you black belt dat
Picture me doin some pushups, and get ambushed up
And put in a box all squooshed up
So motherfucker be a learner
Cause I can't hit or wrestle a niggas without pullin out my burner
So when a motherfucker want to fight
You fuck around with G and you'll be fightin death tonight
So you don't wanna get loose chief
Cause I'm givin more flat lines to niggas than loose-leaf
So come on Bruce Lee
Yo I'mma show you who the motherfucker is with all the juice G
So if you wanna intimidate
A nigga like me, great, will make your fuckin head disintegrate
I'm sendin niggas to Bedrock
Look out for the red dot

But Imma tell you this, they neighborhood got the Goodfellas
But they come arrest us for the same shit they sell us
Cause they don't want to see a young black nigga rollin'
Inside a nice car, nice kit, without the shit being stolen
So they come and lock a nigga up
Meanwhile some corrupt, politician nigga is making bigger bucks
Niggas getting blamed for the crystal
But we don't grow the motherfucking coke and we don't make the fucking pistols

A man is a victim of 
Cock Blocking
This action usually results in broken friendships
The following, is an example..

Kool:
 Aiyyo Jinx
Jinx:
 Hey whassup G?
Kool:
 This girl'll be here in a minute
Jinx:
 Uh-huh
Kool:
 The bitch got a nice ass, and I'm tryin to get in it
Jinx:
 Cool, that's alright, but why you tellin me this shit?
Kool:
 To make sure you don't mind
Jinx:
 Uh-huh
Kool:
 chillin out while I hit it
Jinx:
 Naww nigga, I'll just turn on the TV set
Jinx:
 Get paid, hit the skins, get some pussy, get your dick wet
Kool:
 Alright then, because my dick is hard as hell
*ding dong ding dong*
Kool:
 The bitch is ringin on my bell

Opened the door, ""Whassup baby? Yo come on in
Here, take a seat, I'll introduce you to my friend""
Now everything is going according to plan
""Yo Jinx this is Debbie, Debbie this is Jinx my man"" (Whassup baby?)
I went to the closet, hung up her coat, put up her hat
""Yo Jinx,"" ""Whassup?""
""Later nigga, I'm goin to the back"" ""See ya!""
I took her to the back, closed the doors and I paused..
.. I'm gonna get some drawers
So we laid on the bed and I just smiled
Because I'm dreamin about fuckin her doggystyle
So I'm thinkin bout some hints that I can slip her
*zipper sound* Fuck it, I'll just pull down her zipper
Feelin her ass, and damn the shit is soft
""Aiyyo baby, why don't you take your shirt and pants off?""
I got the whore ready to let a nigga score
*knocking* Yo who the FUCK is at my door?
*knocking* Now she's annoyed, and boy I got some luck
I cracked the door, ""Yo Jinx, what the FUCK is up?""

""Aiyyo G man, I just, y'know, I wanna get some water and shit
You know I'm kind of thirsty knahmsayin homey? Heh heh""

""What water nigga? Go 'head, go and get it"" ""Aight""
""Now leave me the fuck alone so I can hit it"" ""Aight thanks man""
So then I slammed the door shut *door slams*
I turned around this bitch is pullin her pants back on her butt
Nah chill, yo he ain't comin back no more
I pulled her pants back down and threw em on the floor *whoosh*
I'm tryin to convince her but the shit didn't work
So now I'm here playin tug-of-war with her shirt *rips* (oops)
Yeah don't worry, that same shit won't happen twice
*knocking* ""Aiyyo G man, where's the ice??""
Shit, didn't even get my jock in
*knocking* Cause niggas like Jinx is Cock Blocking

""Now you know this just don't make NO kind of sense""
""Blockin' my cock, like a god damn fence""
""And for the life of me, I didn't know why..""
""Blockin' my cock, like a god damn fence""

Thinkin of a bitch I could be hittin, for no salary
So I called Valerie, found out the bitch was babysittin
The baby's parents went to Europe; and I could see her now
Suckin my dick and lickin my nut like it was maple syrup
She said, ""Come over I'm alone""
And I was knockin at the door before the bitch hung up the phone
""Hey whassup baby? You know I miss you"" ""Whassup?""
Yeah that's some shit you gotta say to get your dick into the pussy tissue
Went in the house and had a seat
The little boy put fifty motherfuckin toys by my feet
Smashin up my ankles with Tonka jeeps
I wish this little motherfucker'd take his ass to sleep
Now my leg got crazy scratches
I said, ""Here, you wanna play?"" 
I gave his ass a book of matches
 (Hey!)
I couldn't even get a rap
Without this little motherfucker jumpin his ass into my bitch's lap
I started rubbin on her curves
But I'm mad because this little brat is gettin on my nerves
I pulled the bitch up by her hand ""What's the matter baby?""
""Aiyyo, whydon'tcha get rid of little man?"" ""Alright baby""
She took me to a room that was dark ""Hey, come in here""
I was undressin on the way to get a head start
And then I let the door shut
Lifted up her skirt and started feelin on the whore's butt
Suckin on her titties like candy
Five minutes later had her comin in her panties
Now she's ready for the dick
""Yo you ready bitch?"" (mmm-hmm) ""Well first, take a lick!""
Down on her knees is where she dropped
Suckin on and suckin on and suckin on my cock
Bust that nut, that's what I'm hopin
Then yo, all of a sudden, the door flew wide open
What the hell is this about? *child crying*
She jumped up in a flash and took my dick out of her mouth
Yeah, the little nigga's throwin a fit
Talkin about he's hungry and shit
""Wait a minute baby, let me get up so I can feed him""
But I felt like takin off my belt and beat him
He already gave my leg a cut
Now the little bastard is fuckin up my nut
She, didn't even get the let off
So I picked up one of his Ninja Turtle dolls and pulled the head off
(Hey whatchu doin?) Yeah motherfucker now we even
Forty-five minute passed, the bitch ain't back, fuck it I'm leavin
I got dressed, and put my hat back on my head (Hey!)
""Later bitch,"" ""No wait baby""
""Drop dead!"" ""What??""
""And by the way, thanks a lot and uhh..
Fuck you and that little nigga for Cock Blockin!""

""Now you know this just don't make NO kind of sense""
""Blockin my cock, like a god damn fence""
""And for the life of me, I didn't know why..""
""Blockin my cock, like a god damn fence""

So all you niggas with the helmets and shoulderpads
Stay the FUCK away from me, word up
The next time you wanna block nigga
Try out for 
the Jets

People in the audience—Kool G Rap is my name
I write rhymes and insert them inside your brain
And DJ Polo—the man I'm behind—
He operates the turntables when I'm rocking my rhymes, see—
 (x4)
Psychopath on the phonograph, nut of the cuts
You heard the boy slice, is he nice or what?
He's the main entertainer inside the show
And he goes by the name of DJ Polo, see...
 (x4)
I supply the data, he's the wheel operator
We're walking tall and we're called The Terminators
I'm Kool G Rap, and he's Polo
He cuts like a pro when I go solo
He's a record spinner winner, that you can bet
Eats DJ's for dinner on his table set
With cuts he concocts and the party rocks
DJ's want to Xerox it out the box
A professional performer, wheels of steel trainer
One hundred percent excellent entertainer
The maker and creator of the lyrical line
Idea of Shakespeare, the mind of Einstein
Surrender, pretender, you don't exist
As a vocalist, so you can kiss this
I'm Kool G Rap, greatest of all times
And you can see it, inside my rhymes
See it's a demo
 (x4)
My recital will form a musical brainstorm
Powerful sound waves where ear drums are torn
The performer recites, competitors ignite
Audiences tonight I came to incite
Fascinating results, a defeat will be difficult
Equivalent to a thousand volts
To my brief rap speech you attach like a leech
Examine when I'm jamming and when I preach
Before I'm completed, you will all be deleted
You said I sucked, instead I succeeded
Fan fascinator, I supply data
According to the groove, I'm a real smooth operator
I activate a musical device
Dialogues are concise, no need to splice
My system contains musical rap rain
Instrumentals inserted inside your brain
All levels rate low with a medium tempo
I give a dramatical cameo show
And now you know DJ Polo
These party people are ready to go
See it's a demo
 (x4)
Better than a Snicker when it comes to a snack
I go solo with Polo when I'm in combat
I'm the MC humanoid and I just get annoyed
Boy you'll be destroyed cause you copy like a Polaroid
Coming like a meteor inside any area
Make the people merrier, vicious like a terrier
Like a terrorist, I will terrorize
Telling any territory I'm a glory enterprise
The microphone fanatic, cause I'm the Asiatic
Brotherman from the motherland, rappers automatically
Suffer as I suffocate, then I start to alienate
Make you an inmate, so you cannot retaliate
Mutilate at a rate to penetrate you
No other crew can rescue
My talents are balanced my audience is silent
MC's stop biting or I'll get violent
It's a demo...
 (x4)
I take a scene to the extreme
To the climax and those who sleep will have a wet dream
So don't even quote what you write is dolt
Your rhymes are small-time through a microscope
More cooler than an Ice Ages
Biters, let the effective students walk through my white pages
Different stages of rage that I'm going through
And like an owl, you'll know who to
Feed your greed, you want and need
The rhymes that you carefully read, but your eyes bleed
Cause my fury is scary
And if you bite, you'll be leaving all your teeth for the Tooth Fairy
Go ahead and dare me, if you think I'm joking or playing
When you're feeling what I'm saying, you'll be kneeling and praying
Then I release steam like a radiator
And attack MC's like a gladiator
As my talent proceeds to grow, yo
This ain't the end of the show, it's a demo

All you can do is call me daddy
Suck this dick and get a muthafuckin beef paddy
Five bucks is too steep
It's all about leavin bitches in a hotel asleep
Bitch got kids then I'ma duck her
You better go and find daddy to feed them little muthafuckas
Cause I'm only with the stickin
And spend a night but that's right bitch, I ain't trickin

I'm not tryin to give a hint
I'm comin straight out, don't ask me for a red muthafuckin cent
No trips to the beauty parlor
Cause I could have a million bucks and won't give up a damn dollar
And don't tell me your moms is sick

You want a ring with five carats?
Well, don't be surprised if it gets eaten by a fuckin rabbit

Train Robbery,Live and Let Die,1992.0,"Down the subway stairs, straight through the turnstyle
No smile, but I'm waitin in the station for the 7 to turn it wild
Me and my three shorties, guzzlin forties
We're bout to rob and steal and get real fuckin naughty
One carries a tre pound, the other a four-fifth
Both ready to buck and ain't nuttin to be fucked with
It's dark and it's midnight, the police in dead sight
Look through the fuckin tunnel and I see movin headlights
Fuck it I cock the baretta back and put my hood on
My shorties are game, I got the same shit they put on
Impatiently we're waitin for the doors to open
Got on the train we're car from car but not too far I started scopin
Starin at this bitch for a minute
My man pulled out the mag, opened the bag and said
""Put all your fuckin money in it!""
Even the jewelry on the hands
He slapped the bitch up, and she cried
And begged him not to take her wedding band
Now everybody's in shock, and I'm walking past
The scared ass passengers with the nine millimeter cocked
Lookin for who was next
And sittin by the pole was a old ass man wearin a Rolex
I took the shit and hit the bastard hard
Ripped his pants clean off his ass and got the Visa and the MasterCard
My little man said, ""A-yo check this,""
He pointed at this bitch who looked rich, wearin a long pearl necklace
Word to God, she got my dick hard, and that was the truth
So I drug her ass inside the conductor's booth
As the ho started to shout, I threw her on her knees
And made her freeze and put my dick inside her pretty mouth
All of the sudden I just, nutted
Pulled up my pants and zipped up
She's on the floor with her mouth flooded
Came back out with the iron *gun shot*
The next motherfucker to move, is dyin!
The train came to a stop, and who gets on it
To ruin the whole plot, was a motherfuckin cop
He fired at me -- I fired back at him
God damn, I almost had him
In a flash, my little shorty's on his ass
Got down on the ground, and let the three pound blast
Lead went dead in his chest
Tore him a new asshole, right through his bullshit vest
But the pig was still breathin
I wanted to finish him off, but I said, ""Fukkit, I'm leavin""
Grabbed the sack hit the track and started runnin
""Ohhh shit! More fuckin cops comin!""
So I stopped and took a shot
Hopin the cop got popped but yo I didn't see nobody drop
Headed straight into the exit, and out in the street
Police outside like fifty deep
So I started to creep but I didn't sleep
Spotted this bitch pullin up in a Jeep
How sweet! ""Now get the fuck out the car!""
Slammed the bitch down on the tar, now she needs CPR
But I don't give a fuck, I just jetted
My man said set it, two more detectives got wetted
As we raced down the block
Lettin off a whole lot of shots and didn't stop
Police gave us a chase, a blue and white rage
My shorty got grazed in the face
Another cop tried to let off, I put another clip in my shit
And blew his motherfuckin head off
Stomped my foot on the gas pedal
Sparks are flyin and shit, from the bullets hittin the car metal
So now we just runnin
The shorties and me G, one of the three gunmen
Side by side we're on the highway, and lettin off shots
The three outlaws, against the cops
It's like a fuckin adventure
About four cops got dropped, three motherfuckers got injured
The last of the cop cars pressed up
My man aimed the joint, the hollow points tore his fuckin vest up
I put a slug inside the tire
They ran into a tall-ass wall, now it's great balls of fire
So now we got away clean, yeah
Smilin like a motherfucker countin the green
You can't fuck with the kid
My boy started thinkin back on the train
Bout all that shit we did
Leavin niggas in poverty
Three black motherfuckers pulled off a great train robbery
Took all those motherfuckers ducats
But hey, what I can say, life is a bitch so FUCK IT",https://genius.com/Kool-g-rap-and-dj-polo-train-robbery-lyrics
Bad to the Bone,Wanted: Dead Or Alive,1991.0,"I'm bad to the bone with a style like Al Capone
I'ma smile while I give you the dial tone
Eatin shrimp and girls I be pimpin
Walk like I'm limpin, this brother ain't simpin
Not to mention, I'm winner of Mack Daddy conventions
I get a lot of attention
Sleepin in sheets that's made of satin
With one of my money makin honies, she's mixed Spanish and Latin
She's a fly type of swinger
Twenty carats on her fingers, minks on every coathanger
In a highrise, made for only fly guys
With a size that attracts the ladies eyes
Keepin the stash and the cashflow
Profile's kept low, more dough than Barry Manilow
Fly cars, I got diamonds in jelly jars
To earn respect, collectin bar fight scars
Slick talkin with a chick when I'm walkin
Midnight stalkin, all the suckers be hawkin
And I max while you be waxin your Cadillacs
Smooth as a sax, but I can cut you like an axe
Big spender, cause I'm a winner like Bruce Jenner
I burn all beginners and let em simmer like a TV dinner
On the phone cause I'm hard like stone
Holdin my own, cause I'm bad to the bone

I'm gettin cash and ladies receive my passion
Parties I'm crashin with a flashy type of action
On stage I kick outrageous
And I enslave the bravest, more diamonds than Sammy Davis
I'm more dramatic than Dallas is
More pretty than a palace is, hands no callouses
Give me a clever girl and I'll outfox her
The man that rocks her in pure silk boxers
So what you want honey a chump or a champ?
Visa or food stamps, Latins or lamps?
I run the game like Sega
Go to war like Noreaga, hit like Schwarzenegger
Excitin when I'm fightin I'm frightenin
Stick chicks slick in quick like greased lightning
Ladies I'll love you all tomorrow like Annie
And I bet you'll all leave with wet panties
Cause I can make a eighty yard dash come back fast
Wrap rappers all up in the back like a jackass
Police wanna harass me
Cause I got all the material that has me lookin jazzy
The MC patroller
Pockets so fat, I flat em down with a dough roller
Dead zone when I strike the microphone
G. Rap's known, cause I'm bad to the bone

I never needed a helpin handin
I'm outstandin, type of guy girls never abandon
The one who rollin with force, three across your belly
Knockin suckers out the box like I'm playin skelly
Cause I pull out the .45 if you offend me
And leave the barrel of it smokin like a chimney
Rhymes are dynamic, voice is titanic
Gigantic, suckers get frantic and then panic
A smooth talker, cause I'm a Queens New Yorker
My rhymes bring more Good Times than Jimmie Walker
A bumrusher, cause I'm a crusher of hardrocks
When I turn 30, I'll still be dirty as Redd Foxx
Try to cope, what I wrote, get a sore throat
My lyrical notes float like sailboats
I keep it steady for the petty sucker rappers I'll be ready
I got more bodies than Frank Nitti
Battles I win em cause I send em to Hell when I begin em
Because I put it in em like a venom
Discover the toughest rap brother you ever seen
Not a fairy, but milky like the Dairy Queen
Movin around like a smooth choreographer
Posin my hoes in all clothes for the photographer
On video, show I makin your girlfriend moan
Cause I'm bad to the bone",https://genius.com/Kool-g-rap-and-dj-polo-bad-to-the-bone-lyrics
Riker’s Island,Wanted: Dead Or Alive,1987.0,"Well listen to me, you young hoods, this is some advice
You do the crime, you're payin the price
Cause if you're in the drug spots, sellin crack on the block
Snatchin chains, bustin brains, like a real hardrock
If you ever hear a cop say you're under arrest
Go out just like a trooper, stick out your chest
Cause you might have been robbin, you might have been whylin
But you won't be smilin on Riker's ISLAND

Just to hear the name it makes your spine tingle
This is a jungle where the murderers mingle
They say the place is crowded but there's room for you
Whether you're white or you're black, you'll be black and blue
Cause in every cellblock, there is a hardrock
With a real nice device that's called a sock lock
Don't ever get caught in a crime my friend
Cause this bus trip is not to Adventure's Inn
They have a nice warm welcome, for new inmates
Razors, and shanks, and sharp edged plates
Posses will devour, punks with power
After the shower it's, rush hour
So watch your back before you get sacked
These a bunch of maniacs that's about to attack
If you're a hustlin pro, keep a low profile'n
Cause you won't be smilin on Riker's ISLAND

C-74, adolescents at war
Put your ear to the floor, you can hear the roar
They take you out of BC, they now found you a cage
All eyes are glued to you like you're up on stage
If you're soft as a leaf, don't get into a beef
And God be with you chief if you got gold teeth
Some try to be hard, front and say I'm God
Don't know a lesson say a blessin, you're gonna get scared
(
Yo call the C.O.)
 That won't be necessary
He'll watch him beat you down, and take your commissary
Inside the lunchroom, you meet your doom
Someone is lookin at your sharper than a tablespoon
Use your hands like a man, don't go out like a chump
Never 'fess, bench press so that you can be pumped
If you don't got a game, you get beaten and slain
And scared as a mouse in a house of pain
So to all the jailbirds that listen to hip-hop
Move your pelvis like Elvis do the Jailhouse Rock
You might be coolin, you might be stylin
But you won't be smilin on Riker's ISLAND
If you're on a drug tip, don't be a Dumbo
Police investigate like Columbo if they think you're sellin jumbo
But don't get me wrong, it might be your thing
Whether smilin on the Island, or singin in Sing-Sing
The way you're takin pictures and you're givin a smile
Cheerin, the priveledge for a long long while
So keep your money pilin, keep profilin
Cause ahh, you won't be smilin on Riker's Island",https://genius.com/Kool-g-rap-and-dj-polo-rikers-island-lyrics

""Rocked and rolled, but then you rolled and rocked""

Listen
You get upset, when you hear the Large Professor
On your girl's cassette, deck, expect
Nothin comin soft, cause I'll never throw weaker blows
I'll kick you in your  and your breath'll smell like sneaker soles
Now how's that for a fixin?
You'd better rather go to Roy's, cause I ain't kickin science fiction
I kick a size nine sneaker or boot
Chop chumps to stumps, and they remain mi-nute
The Sheik, I get deep, and always leave with the wet meat
Because of my technique, I'm the one you let speak
I collect crops and props like spinach
I'm vintage, your single sums up to a ten inch
My soul brother Van Paul and Pete Rock
Keep the funk flowin until the last beat stops
The soul man, can't have you leavin on a stretcher
Probably, have you leavin in leather, I catch a body
From wreckin slum rappers, but to be frank
I don't give a  I got money in the bank

""Rocked and rolled, but then you rolled and rocked""

""Rocked and rolled, but then you rolled and rocked""

This is the stage of triple-X
When you're sittin by your radio, screamin, ""Freddie Foxxx goes next""
Those beholdin the words of a master
Find mental disaster, as I kick it faster
Whoever opposes me, and what I feel
Might find their legs bein replaced by steel
This is a brand new year, and the penalty is death
So there won't be a lot of suckers left
I grab the mic, and I load it like a long four-fifth
Huh, and dare you to riff
Or even sneeze as I blow you to your knees, have you curled up
In a corner like a dog, with hoof and mouth disease
Spittin razor blades, cuttin veins you can't stitch
I got you screamin like a 
I took your microphone, you can't get it back
Because your rap was wack
I'm comin fifty strong in an armored tank
And takin money to the bank

Kool G. Rap for your first selection, get up on it
To my opponents, let me just demonstrate for a moment
Crooks gettin hooked, to my book, just like an addiction
Stop your diction you drop, the science fiction
Let's get specific you can't get with it
I'm too terrific and scientific, forget it
Don't even try to limp it, you're not ready to make hits
You still got a learner's permit
Poppin that , you better sit
Here's a word, of a third degree burn, so listen and learn
You're missin a turn, so you better get, concerned
My challenger, check the calendar
I'm as live as a .45 caliber, Colt
With a silencer, wettin up, suckers I be settin up
Button up, while I'm cuttin up, never lettin up
I don't link up, with suckers with raps that shrank
Thanks sonny, I'm takin money to the bank

One in the chamber, eight in the clip
Pull out a razor, watch your rhyme book rip
It's Ant Live, liver and deliveries get liver
With G. Rap, and we're the sole survivors
MC's wanna try me, but can't escape, my clutch
Too much, caught in the ropes, like double dutch
You wanna run up, you better run up light
Cause like a whorehouse shippin out  tonight
Believe me I ain't goin out like a brick parachute
Or a fruit, or a guy that wears Brut
Cologne, I'm violent prone, so leave me alone
I'm about to set fire to the microphone
And leave the mic so hot you need potholders for this
Due to burnt wires it's cordless

Kool Is Back,Wanted: Dead Or Alive,1990,"Boy, come on, get with this 'cause you can't diss this
I'm burnin' your ass like syphillis
A fast brother, you're just a lover with a slow hand
I freeze MCs into Frosty the Snowman
No man withstands the pain of brain cells
Phaser, hellraiser, cut like a laser, Polo plays a part
Inside the arts, the rap charts start to break you apart, so get smart
You cry for help, knowin' you felt the rhyme
Makin' the track melt, Polo chops like a black belt
MCs are grounded, pounded down, astounded
Rounded up, pounds of sounds when I drowned 'em
Surrounded, check the date, and play when rate too great
Related too late, I demonstrate fate
I'm fast and passin' the stage of an assassin
Massacre, in a mass I start blastin'
Theoretical, periodical
Blowin' up particles of molecules, here, read the articles
Every time I built a plan, it killed a man
MCs got smoked without a filter and
Scuffed and puffed like marijuana
Terminator of data and your rhymes is Sarah Conner
You can't rip up, rap up, slip up, slap up
'Cause you're trapped up to get capped up
Play the back of this here scenery
You clowns'll get broke down like machinery
I bring trouble on the double, bust you like a bubble
Hard rocks are crushed into rubble
The gates of Hell open wide, so scope in
And I'm hopin' you're brought to the Pope and
The Holy Bible when you made your arrival
Now, the name of the game is survival
The result isn't real difficult, the strategy:
Stayin' Alive like John Travolta
My rhymes are gettin' hotter
I got around to a lot of towns like a Globetrotter
So, I'mma give you the Hell that you brought me in
I'm a king with the sting of a scorpion
I just follow your footprint, trace, track and blackout
You better shout to get a rap out
What I arrange, invented is strange, demented, deranged
You changed when I entered
A stage of furious rage when I had this madness
Badness, you felt sadness
Raps are brave and outrageous
All those chicken rhymes you written
Should be put in the Yellow Pages
I stand tall, play the wall and watch your brain stall
And wet your ass like rainfall
I think you need a replacement, you're illin'
Call that buildin', boy? You're still in the basement
My brain cell swells to jam like a pelican
Fresh out of breath, death left you a skeleton
I'm gonna need your full cooperation
This is a matter of life and death, operation
To ease a man in the siege of surgery
Bein' done without anesthesia
Go slow? Hell no, I let the beat kick
And I get wicked like the Witches of Eastwick
I'm not soft, I kill suckers off
Disarmin' it, bombin' it, off in a coffin
You get struck and just like a motherfuckin' duck and
Plucked this shit out of luck and bucked
Designated to self-destruct
Knocked around like a hockey puck
K-double-O-L G R-A-P, N-O M-C plays me
You wish your name had a G
But to be a badder G, boy, you gotta play with strategy
Top rankin', thinkin' ability, memory bankin'
But instead, you're just sinkin'
I attack like a pack of whacked out maniacs

Straight Jacket,Live and Let Die,1992.0,"""Ghetto Style""
""Talk that shit""

Help me doctor doctor cause I'm seein lots of spots
I'm thinkin' of pink elephants with little polka dots
I'm tired, crazy tired, but I cannot get no sleep
Cause every time I close my eyes I think I'm six feet deep
I feel I'm goin' slow as hell, but everything is speedin'
Last night I woke up screamin' and my bathroom walls were bleedin'
I thought I fell asleep at work, but then when I awoke
I was all alone and had my own hands on my throat
Clippings from the newspaper of murders; my library
Sometimes I get a urge to walk inside a cemetery
I looked into a mirror, seen a rope around my neck
I smoke a lot of cigarettes, cause I'm a nervous wreck
Tryin' to relax, I ran some water in the tub
Vision somebody slaughtered, then the water turned to blood
I'm runnin' down the hallway tryna reach an exit door
The more and more I run, seems like it's further than before
Voices sometimes tell me what I won't do, what I will do
Voices in my head right now are tellin' me to kill you
Filled up with anxiety, I went to Lover's Lane
Seen a couple kiss and then blew out the brother's brain
I feel the world's against me and the women are so dirty
I hate women today because my mother used to hurt me
I think I'm goin' crazy, doc, no longer can I hack it
Please, doctor please, put me in a straight jacket
""Ghetto Style""
""Talk that shit""

A lady picked me up hitchikin', what a big mistake
Several hours later, there's a body by the lake
Walked into a train station, headed towards the back
Caught a flashback, and pushed a man right on the track
I'm in my darkroom inside my house; that is deserted
Developin' the photo of a ho that I just murdered
I took a walk one night because I wanted to get out
I stepped outside, I paused, and I was back inside my house
Called up plenty doctors; told 'em all about my health
My phone just plays a dial tone; I'm talkin' to myself
Snap back to reality, at least that's what I thought
Runnin' from the spirits of the bodies I just caught
I can't escape this hell I'm in, not even in my dreams
I cover both my ears, because I'm sick of hearin' screams
I've been a mental case since I was in the seventh grade
Stabbed another student, licked his blood off of my blade
I got two personalities inside, sometimes they battle
When I look at my picture, all I see is scribble scrabble
I feel I'm really losin' it, 
I need to write to Abby
The characters on TV try to reach right out and grab me
I always hear somebody talkin' bout they gonna do me
But I listen again and it's those voices talkin' to me
You heard of shadowboxin'? I see mine and then attack it
Please, doctor please, put me in a straight jacket

Cookin niggas better than mama's dinner

I whoop your motherfuckin ass and get arrested for child abuse
Even your bitch can get it nigga
I shove the barrel of a nine up her behind
And pull the fuckin trigger
Goin Psycho like Norman Bates

Because lately niggas ain't able to take me
It ain't a man in the land that can stand G. Rap
Save that candy-rap, shit for the handicapped
Niggas'll get slayed like a bunch of play pirates

wet em up like sprinkles

See I manage to give niggas more than a bandage
Blue Cross and Blue Shield, couldn't cover the motherfuckin damage
Cause I'm bold and bigger, puttin manholes in niggas
And holdin triggers up, to them golddiggers
So if you all over my dick just like a rubber
My rap is so fat, I make sales in fuckin' whale blubber
You better duck, I'm like a volcano when I erupt
You bitch-ass rappers'll get fucked
And you'll be one ho, like Marilyn Monroe
Left on death row, because I let the gun go
Bang blow your motherfuckin brains out
But you need more than detergent to get that motherfuckin stain out
Cause I serve more crabs than Red Lobster's
When I pop shots, I leave lotsa dead mobsters
Put down the microphone whether unknown or famous
You're out of luck and I don't give a FUCK what your name is
Boy you better split, cause I'mma house shit
My dick'll be rich if you niggas
Wants to put your money where your mouth is
Gassed up ass nigga, come set it
Cause when I pick up the gun, that be the end of the unleaded
Now you could be a gold or a platinum artist
But deep down, you fuckin silly clowns know who's the hardest
Niggas I watered down with the quarter pound
Cause my slaughter sound can be caught around
And found the slaughter town
For the clowns got eighty rounds worth of ammo

They won't hire a motherfucker with a jail record
So the least I could do, is look presentable
But I'm labelled by the city as a criminal
They won't give me no slack, Jack

And it was all full of niggas that was dirty and stinkin' as hell
Four hours passed already, so now I'm yawnin'
And I'm hopin to see the judge in the mornin'
Finally they call my name and I get up with speed
To appear before the judge, and make a plea
I saw the judge, he was a brother
He said, ""How do you plead?"" I said, ""Not guilty, motherfucker!""
Then I got kicked out of court, sent to the

I saw this nigga, he was stone tall
I said, ""Yo, I gotta make this motherfuckin' phone call""
He said, ""These 
whores
 are mine, and you ain't widdit""

I did my time and now I'm back from my vacation
Right on track, they put me 
back in population

And he picked up the phone one day and thought I was some other nigga
Yeah that bitch is tryin' to play me like a sucker
Cause on the down and low I heard another nigga fucked her
Now homicide is on my mind
For knowin' that this bitch is at home, screwin' while I'm doin time
And the nigga that's hittin' the skins
Is a bold motherfucker cause he's one of my own friends
But that's alright cause I got somethin' for they asses
And when I see him I'mma smash his fuckin' glasses
Livin' in hell but now my blood is gettin' cold
Two months later, I got released on parole
So now I'm rollin' colder than a blizzard
I got some iron from my man and went to pay the stupid bitch a visit

Oh nobody's home huh? So I kicked it til the shit fell

I ain't no muthafuckin minor
Fuckin with me is like playin Russian roulette with your vagina
I'll even fuck a pregnant bitch
I poke her muthafuckin baby in the head with my dick
You wanna give me head, I won't deprive ya
But it won't be no more room in your mouth for no saliva
Dick so hard it might surprise ya
In order to get it soft you need a meat tenderizer
It ain't a box spring thing no more
Shit, me and your ass'll be cavin through the floor
Shit, Mickey Rourke was weak
Cause my dick'll stay hard longer than _9 1/2 Weeks_
And if you're givin me the innocence, girlfriend
Forget about takin temperature that way ever again
I make a grown-ass woman start to moan when I hit it
But under 21 is not permitted

Under 21 is not permitted
But 35's the limit
(Hey yo, you gotta be of age)
Under 21 is not permitted

That's right, bitches, I wanna knock you
What can my cock do, rock you till the ( *cockcrow* )
Then straight back to the evening
All night long it's nothin but heavy breathin
Slam-bam, thank you ma'am
Forget Terry Lewis and come and let my Jimmy Jam
Now I got plenty rubbers in a stash
But I'm so happy to get the pussy that I'm fuckin you with GLAD Bags
Yeah bitch, like Richard Simmons I'mma stretch you
My best position is the muthafuckin bretzel
Givin golden showers of pain
I'm like Prince but yo, I wanna see you laughin at my Yellow Rain
But yo, you gotta be of age
Cause when I'm through hittin the clit I don't wanna sit inside a cage
Under 21 is not permitted, girl, it's simple
Cause some bitches make you feel like you're fuckin Shirley Temple
So back off, you little skeezer
Kool G Rap can't see ya because your beaver got a Ceasar
You can't get none if you're too young
Sorry ho, you gotta go because you don't know how to come
I feel lust but just forget it
Yeah, under 21 is not permitted


See, I don't wanna be nobody's cellmate
So you gotta wait cause I don't fuck around with jailbait
You're too young to give up ass, ho
Ho, you gotta come back when that pussy grows a afro
Then that's when my dick hardens
Fuck Great Adventures, I'm goin straight to Bush Gardens
And if that don't inflict pain
I'm leavin your house with shit stains on my dick veins
You know I dick em when I date em
Have em breakin cause I be makin love to bitches like I hate em
Then I'm shootin like a Luger
And I get scratches on my back like I was fuckin Freddy Krueger
I make a hooker very happy
I need a catcher's mitt the way bitches be throwin pussy at me
And if your ass is too old you gotta cruise
I only knock boots, not muthafuckin orthopedic shoes
Old bitches got me runnin
Caues I don't need a bitch peein all over me talkin about she's comin
So grandma, just quit it
Under 21 is not permitted but 35's the limit

Under 21 is not permitted
But 35's the limit

Each and every one of you duck muthafuckas
Your girl puckers her lips, so I stuck her
You're jellin' me, well, so what the hell you're tellin' me?
Now, I'mma show you fuckin' with me is a felony
I'm crushin', so you suckers can start hushin'
Shush, no discussion, cuz I'mma start rushin'
The payback, and I attack a pack that's wack
The black mack; brown like a Cracker Jack
Slick and quick, I go pick a vic to stick and kick some shit
Chicks I dick whip; the one
Kill her for fun with a gun, my son
I don't run, I kick muthafuckas done
It don't matter, I make niggas scatter
Teeth starts to chatter, your head I'mma splatter
Arraigned, breakin' a main vein
And watchin' my name bring you pain
I'm standin' on your blood stain
Hard to hold, I'm bold, I roll real cold
Too much soul, dick made of gold
I roll niggas to hell; you tried to swell, but fell
Now get well or die like a dry cell
A rap villain, chillin' and I don't give a fuck about a killin'
Cuz I'm still in effect when you're illin'
A terrorist; I terrorize like an assassin
Yes, I'm trespassin', your ass I'm harassin', huh
Talk is cheap, I'm keepin' ya six feet deep, so don't sleep
When I creep, you'll leap like athletes slammin'
Examine what I'm jammin'
Hey, I don't play -- I burn like a gamma ray
Lay for prey; display the bait and wait...
Muthafuckas are scared straight!


Aiyo, check this out...
The creature, feature, searcher, preacher, teacher
Torture, rupture, capture, rapture, reach ya
Musical master, mind reacts as a
Brain that has a knowledge of NASA
You're just a Kit-Kat, small as a Tic-Tac
But I'm a Big Mac, cuz I'm G Rap
Well equipped with a hip-hop lip
My memory bank is like a microchip
My bass will give a shake of an earthquake
It'll make you, sucker MC, wanna jump in the lake
Cuz I'm murder, homi-cide, comma
Crush, kill, destroy with excitement and drama
Speaker, sound seeker, you become weaker
My art is a smoker, your material is mediocre
The Rap Olympia; devastate the area
Again, I'm brainier, lyrical mania
Power source, and a G enforced
Your headboards, they need rap wars
So, come one or two, step through for a few
Doubles and couples -- and I'll cripple all triples (Ha! Ha!)
Boy, you can't handle it
None or any, one or many, some or plenty
Cuz I'm not the stranger, just the rhyme arranger
Highly explosive, keep out, danger!
Packin' Gs while you try to beat me
But for these MCs, I call 'em all wannabe G's
What I write is in the smokin' section
Here's an injection of rap perfection
So, what the heck? You select my dialect
Next man's cassette, yo, reject and eject
Cuz I could use a technique, modern or antique
Beats never repeat, show you that I can speak
Totally, properly, but rappers wanna copy me
This takes strategy, just like Monopoly
Figure it out:
Kool G Rap is about makin' armies and crews look like Girl Scouts
Cuz when I start rappin', I keep the people clappin'
Suckers that be yappin' don't think that this can't happen...
(Yo, MCs, all wannabe Kanes and Chuck Ds, Es, Fs, Gs
ROCK H-I-Js, Ks, L-M-N-O-Ps

Yeah
Y'all bitches check this shit out for the '95
My man comin atcha with this fat shit
Y'all bitches grab a hold of this shit
And hold this shit tight
Word up

Yo, I'm your typical nigga from the city
Most bitches hate me cause my attitude is shitty
I push up on em cause I see they lookin cute and shit
But then they gotta go and do some fuckin stupid shit
It don't suprise me though cause I always seen this in em
I only like them bitches when I got my penis in em
But I don't like so-called sophisticated women
Frontin they got pussies that be big enough to swim in
Got a little 9 to 5 thinkin she's a winner
Knowin goddamn well her boss is stickin dick up in her
You press her for the sex and she front like she ain't with it
And love to suck a muthafuckin dick, but won't admit it
She'll tell you she first started havin sex when she got older
Then throw her legs on your shoulders like she took up yoga
And some bitches be burnin, you niggas know the half
If you open up they pussy, you can see the movie 'Backdraft'
She's waitin for you to stick your dick up in her cherry
To put your fuckin ass inside the cemetary
They talk too much, that's why I never date em bitches
Believe me when I tell you that I hate them bitches
But I love em when they suckin on my dick and shit
I bust a nut inside they mouth and they keep lickin it
And when I'm fuckin I leave they clitoris in stitches
My name is Kool G Rap and I'm checkin all you bitches

(Bitch)
Yeah
This is for all you bitches out there in the world
Check it out

This is for you bitches from the other races
Used to be prejudiced, but now you smile in brothers' faces
Your parents raised you on some stay-away-from-niggers-shit
But now you fuck us cause you found out we got bigger dicks
And I remember slavery days when they sold and bought us
Now your little white daughters suck our dick for us
Spanish bitches wouldn't fuck nobody black and shit
Until we started gettin paid from off this rappin shit
Now they suckin on our dicks and callin us papi chulo
And teachin us Spanish ??? bitcha ??? culo
Puertorican men get mad when niggas fuck they women
Can't stand the sight of seein a black dick goin up in em
But I ain't with discrimination, that's that wack shit
I could care less if you was purple and fuckin a black bitch
So if she lets your ass, go 'head and get some sex from her
God gave her the pussy, she can sleep with whoever the fuck she wanna
The first time I saw some niggas with some chinese bitches
I asked myself a question: where the fuck they find these bitches?
But then I had to learn that the money talks
And when your ass is broke, any honey walks
But fuck a hindu bitch, no, I won't be in a hurry
Because I know that bitch's pussy smells like fuckin curry
From the one that brought you Road To The Riches
My name is Kool G Rap and I'm checkin all you bitches

(Break a bitch neck
Meanin break a woman's neck
Because she's a bitch?
It's sick, this is sick
It's gotta stop
It's psychics talkin shit)

Home Sweet Home,Live and Let Die,1992.0,"Brothers on the corner sellin junk
Got held up by the hotties got the shotties in the trunk
You got the hardrocks wavin Glocks at the punks
Police only harass you when they wanna get a chunk
They got so many corners and they got so many spots
And I can't even bump up the block
Without the, ""Yo man, what you got?""
I'm walkin past somebody lookin strange
He's lookin for a hit for veins
Or he'll blow out somebody's brains
Even the shorties livin naughty lives
Walkin around, even drive around, with big forty-fives
I just found out the candy store's a front
They walk in the candy store
Man G, candy's far from what they want
You might see a pickle or a popsicle
But if you step to the back, you get dimes, twenties, and nickels
Honey used to look like a winner
Now she can't even get took to dinner
Cause so many dealers ran up in her
Somebody's blood is on the tar
Last night was a homicide from a fight inside the bar
Loudmouth tryin to show her ass, but somebody
Broke a whiskey bottle and cut her butt up with the glass
Money got robbed for his bank
They broke in his house and took everything
Except the kitchen sink
Little man murdered on the scene
He tried to come off at the liquor store, he's only 17
Granny's damn near pushin 80
A couple of hoods grabbed her pocketbook, and stabbed up the lady
Cover your head, cause it's a dead zone, in the red zone
Yeah, this is my home sweet home

Three card molly, another man to fool
Whites will stop at the red lights, to look at us like animals
I'm gettin frisked by the cops
They only tryin to get props, for blowin off a black man's top
Up in apartment 3G, this sweetie named DiDi wants to see me
But yo I heard she's givin VD
Just when you think the skies are gettin blue
Bang bang -- another brother's split in two
Can't sleep, cause the streets are filled with danger
Miss, your little daughter's a swinger, you can't change her
She left with a stranger, inside a drug dealer's party
Now off to the morgue, to go indentify her body
Sonny boy is goin on the strip
Robbin niggas cracks, with a mac, without a clip
Somebody gave a tip, so the next time he flipped
And shorty got ragged, another bodybag is zipped
A baby is born and needs lovin
But instead, the mother smothered him and shoved him in a oven
Cops killin our kids, but they bill us
So what's more worse, the killer cops or the Cop Killers
Everyday's another risk
I'm even mad to go to my pad, the hallways always smell like piss
No heat, just pots of hot water
I'm walkin eight flights up, the elevator's out of order
Man that landlord is the lowest
Because I let my door slam and saw a damn eviction notice
I felt like breakin all his bones, pssssh
I'm gettin kicked out of my home sweet home

You're scared straight as soon as G Rap penetrates
You wanna escape, but you got a date to meet fate
Run for your life when I'm starting
Suckers are getting turned to missing motherfuckers on a milk carton
Danger, when I rearrange and change a face, ace
You're being replaced by a stranger
I injure, and escape like a ninja
You got struck by a fucking revenger
A bullet inserted in your head, a shot got
Murdered, nobody seen shit, nobody heard it
Fuck around, the price is more than McDonald's pays
And you can sing my blues to Billie Holiday
Put your ass in my path and I'm a blast it
Mind over matter, I burn like battery acid
Terrorizing, sizing up the guys-a
Finger on trigger, when I pull it, a bullet flys in
G's a madman, came from the Badlands
Crush niggas in my bare hands like beer cans
Leaving a gash like the New York Slasher
Showing my inches in a trench like a flasher
You got a problem, I'm a problem solver
Solve more problems with a .357 revolver
Come near you pay dearly
And I can barely hear when you talk so speak up clearly
On a sole role, the golden mic holder
And I flatten your ass just like a steam roller
Pity for niggas I waste
Try to disrespect, get the taste of a neck brace
I got your ass on target
You got beef? You better save it for the motherfucking meat market
Rhymes choke you like a headlock
If a sucker's asleep, I turn his shit into Bedrock
Come on son, get done in
Niggas are running like the redcoats is coming
I enlist punk niggas that want some of this
And what's left is the breath of a death wish
(""Rappers go six feat under"") (Repeat 4x)
A pimp that loves shrimps and lobster
And for a hobby I'm hitting niggas up like a mobster
I got a story for each little poor territory
The ghetto glory in all categories
The death threats I received from the head vests
I'm riffing, the suckers stiffen up like a dead pet
The troop that stoops to brutality
Giving all nationalities a taste of reality
Kool G Rap is here to draw
And any sucker that tries to beat him, you meet him in a morgue
All victims unidentified, so check it
You gotta see if it was the sucker from the dental record
What I use to torture liars:
Either fire, barbed wire, live wire, or pliers
So you thought you could last?
Go and get a green thumb because your ass is grass
Eric B. is the undertaker
His pockets swoll because he's rolling in more dough than a baker
Quiet type, but I won't have it
Cause when I swing with the boys I get noisy like traffic
So if you know what I know, see what I see
G Rap is down with a mafioso posse
And I'm quick to go stick other suckers
With a smile just like a sick motherfucker
A bullet inside the sucker's guts and
Hit butt and his nuts, we throw him in the Hudson
This is for all the non-believers
They receive a gash in their ass from a meat cleaver
Don't even try to get fast
You know the time because I'm 5 seconds off your ass
A nightmare leaving you suckers breathless
You stepping to Kool G Rap, then that's a death wish

Enter the Dragon,Rated XXX,1986,"(I think that ehm... ehm...
There are more people that are bad than there are good
And ehm... that if you're good you'll live forever
And if you're bad you'll die when you die)

For an example, examine the sample
Not humble when I rumble, I crumble and trample
Not one part of my diction and sound found to be fiction
What I wrote is dope, so prepare for the addiction
Okay, capital K-double o-l G
Gimme a R, gimme a A, gimme a P
Lyrics, rhythm, and music, some try to chase it
So just let's face it, to G Rap this is basic
Training, I'm explainin, nothin too complicated
My language is English, it's not translated
Whether black or Spanish, I finish, diminish and vanish
I promise to you first, take advantage and damage
If you're in pain actin in mysery I'm sorry
But for the glory I play you out like Atari
The best in a jungle, swamp or safari
City or town, I cold rock a party
I battled in attics, centers and cellars
As many fellas I rock, you think they'd call me Rockefeller
I don't scream and yell, I just communicate well
Cause ideas dwell in every last braincell
I don't keep silent, I grab the mic and get violent
Skill and experience balanced with talent
I'm Cold Chillin', this ain't a hurry and a rushin

Because of this some think that I'm a dumb-dumb
But I rap and attack and attract
And in fact, I'm no clown, I got the style down pat
Teachin a lesson is my profession
Yo, this is a rap session, so raise your hands and ask questions
Follow these instructions carefully with caution
Lyrics that you hear may be a poisonous portion
Don't move your butt, Dr. Butcher release a cut
More chops than a meat shop, more slices than a Pizza Hut
Be alert, men at work, you might get hurt
This is a man's job and it requires an expert
To write a poem along with a tone
Mastered the microphone, on my own and alone
Like crime rhymes are organized, very modernized
Better metaphor, therefore a rap's not harmonized
Clever, it's trickery, hickory-dickory-
Dock, gonna rock till the floors get slippery


Phonograph furious, keep the crowd curious
Hot, not delirious, serious period
Lyrics are a lasso, labels like Asto
Hop on stage and get mean like Castro
Ready for war, strictly hardcore
Not poor, weak nor wack or unsure
Rage, on stage I rampage
Boy, this ain't a birdcage, you got the wrong page
Try the next chapter, it's about rapture
Bones I fracture, poems I manufacture
There'll be no use to introduce
You know I seduce, abuse and produce
You got no juice, you just dried out
I'm never tried out and never died out

In case you got a nine in mind, bring out the canon
The constructor, destructor, instructor

Fascinating revolving and rotating
That's how the record starts motivating

Vocally discharging lyrics like magic
Poetical recital is vital and tragic
Strikes are fatal on the mic I label
Me Kool G Rap and Polo on the table
Violators and intruders
I'll exile barbarian style like an executor
Then muta-late later
Copycatters I batter, G Rap impersonators
Brains scatter my rhyme is the solution
Record rotation forms a revolution
The spin extends another plate blends and
It corresponds to the message I've sent

With lyrics that came from the brain of Mark Twain
So if you can't handle the man, please go and change the channel

Damn, Polo play it again like Sam
Cuts in harmony, you ain't harmin' me
Your beats are moist and your sweet voice is charmin' me
Not flexible, your style needs to be twisted
Plus your name's unlisted
Rhymes are tough like gristle, watch the boy sizzle
Your brainstorms don't even drizzle
But my brainstorms gives lots of pain, lots of rain
Long spins, the strong winds of a hurricane
You get sunken when I hit a punk and
Rag a fag, makin' him stagger like he's drunken
You can't stop treatin' my hip-hop
Like a Blow Pop, chew up the slop like a gumdrop
Makin you sweat like a death threat, slow when I flow

I’m Fly (Original Version),Rated XXX,1986.0,"Why?
(cause I'm fly)
It's not a lie
(cause I'm fly)

I just ride around town in my caddy seville
Lookin buff, pockets stuffed with a grin on my grill
Rollin up my tinted windows, raise my antenna
Cause I'm not only fly, but I'm a big bred winner
Girls in bikinis in my back seat
As I'm doin 95 down a one-way street
Got proof that I paid for everything I bought
So if a cop tries to stop me, i'ma take him to court
Jump out my big car puffin on a cigar
Make my girls wait on the corner while I step in the bar
First I walk through the door then I ( *spitting sound* ) spit on the floor
Give some money to the poor, because I always get more
Take off my black mink and order a drink
My pockets resemble manhattan bank
So on my big ropes is a gucci link
All the pretty girls wink and I tell em, you stink!
Yes, I act so conceited cause I'm a full-breeded
Money-makin, not jamaican, and no way that you could beat it
No, I won't say hello and I won't say hi
And if you ask me why
(why? ) cause I'm fly

No, I'm not high, like I said, I'm fly
Got a natural beauty ma beside my eye
I put my friends in a benz, I put my girls in pearls
Got the firmest epidermis with the silky curls
They call me pretty boy wihtout chips ahoy
This 86 audi is my brand-new toy
I don't gamble or bet, I just sip on a moët
Pull out my new blue bally's and my silk-suit set
Got a body like a boxer, the face of a god
'bout as pretty as a bitty, and I still hit hard
I carry on like a pimp, I even walk with a limp
In a fancy restaurant eatin lobbsters and shrimps
I bathe in champagne with a girl named elaine
In my jaccuzi with a uzi with suzy and jane
The ladies help me undress and start caressin my chest
Only big silk sheets on my fat matress
Whether with honey or not, I make money a lot
I always carry a knot, cause I'm a hi-jackpot
The millionaire of the year, and I'm a hell of a guy
And if you ask me why
(why? ) cause I'm fly
It's not a lie
(cause I'm fly)

Morning velours in gold, another bathrobe
I was the sweets of the street when I was 12 years old
I never searched for a wife, or worked a day in my life
Cause while you're hookin I'll be cookin, lookin sharp as a knife
So you can front if you want, cause in a matter of time
I'm headed straight for the top, and you'll be all on mine
Cause I'm mister spectacular, rich as a bachelor
Relax and count stacks as I max in my maxima
Fly negro, yes, that's me, bro
And when I play cee-lo, I play for a kilo
My diamond rings glitter as I steer my almanetta
Chillin on my sofa with a dollar sign-sweater
The ruler, controller like the ayatollah
Snack on renola, then crack a cold cola
G rap and polo, your excellency, your highness
Just cuss or fuss, and I'll just bust your sinus
Countin my cash, plus mount my stash
Dump the cigarette ash on low-down trash
Marley's car is two-toned, and it's ended with chrome
And the bell telephone makes you feel at home
So remember kool g rap and his dj polo
We're the ones who made 'demo', and we're rockin the show
It's not a legend or fiction, it's not no lie
And if you ask me why
(why? ) cause I'm fly

Butcher Shop,Road To The Riches,1989.0,"[I'm Kool G Rap
Their latest release (x2)
I'm Kool G Rap...and he's Polo]
He's the big boss when his hands criss-cross
Up and down the crossfader turning wax to sauce
It ain't a hip-hop record that he can't chop
Polo show them how it's done in the butcher shop

The rhythm he brings makes the audience swing
While the plates rotates his fingers cling
To the records on felts, your earwax melts
Scratching so hard that he breaks the belts
DJ's relax, kneecaps collapse
My rap perhaps is like a booby trap
Polo the big boar, I'm the warrior of metaphor
Fully equipped manipulating my competitor
And I remain just like a stain
As long as I maintain my brainiac brain
Rap words rehearsed since first grade
My utensil is the pencil and his is a blade
The man at the top of the needle drop
Polo let's have some fun, show them how it's done
Treat them like your son, in the butcher shop

DJ's he's disputed you should be saluted
The man gives a cut with scratches included
I'm Kool G Rap, he's my DJ
This is a mortal combat of the Polo play
Cuts like a scissor, rips like a razor
The sound penetrates elements like a laser
The beat connects to my dialect
New Technic turntables, the party I wreck
Motivation to blend, the rotation begins
They reported his fins on 1010 West
And his name is Polo the phonograph is for bolo
I go solo, to battle Kool G Rap is no-no, bozo
Your style is so-so, equal to disco
Swing and some go-go, and on to calypso
So biters and reciters, don't mean to offend you
Yes I will continue but I'm not a menu
So don't bite or swallow or fight or follow
Recite or borrow rhymes and want to give them back tomorrow
Polo is like Zorro, war hero
Horror, terror, errors: zero
The alert concert network expert
He'll wreck dissect inject insert
Cuts, til your eardrums pop
Polo show them how it's done in the butcher shop

I'm a walking dictionary, an encyclopedia
Rapper with data, the best in the media
Or area, so prepare for your burial
On your radio, pull out your aerial
Or antenna cause this one is a winner
Not a sinner, or an MC beginner
Kool G Rap is just me not he or she or we
Or any other MC
So please, I'm single and not plural
I'm totally high moral, excellent with the oral
Contact, and at the maximum, yo he's climax
DJ Polo attacks the earwax
In the butcher shop",https://genius.com/Kool-g-rap-and-dj-polo-butcher-shop-lyrics
No More Mister Nice Guy,Rated XXX,1986,"(Ah yeah)

Y'all bitches check this shit out right here now
Word up, baby
No more Mister Nice Guy
Fuck all the bullshit
Fuck all that nice shit
No more Mister Nice Guy
(You are not the sensitive man you used to be)

I used to be romantic and considerate
But now I hit the skins, I jump right in, and then get rid of it
Cause I remember when you used to treat me like a stepson
You hung around for fun but yo, I wasn't gettin wet none
Treated you like you was a star big as Madonna
I took you out on dates to go eat steaks at Benny Harner's
I called you on the telephone to see what you was doin
Took a trip to the zoo and bulls were steady tryina do it
??? but I didn't get my rocks off
Talkin bout knockin boots, I didn't even get your socks off
Tryin everything inside the book to get you naked
I guess the candlelight dinners and Spinners records didn't make it
But yo, I'm still ringin your bell holdin roses
We might as well been Eskimos in clothes rubbin noses
I woulda gave you stars from out the sky
But soon as I got the pie
Poof - no more Mister Nice Guy

(You bitch)
Bitch you're actin real funny with your pussy
Yeah bitch
No more Mister Nice Guy
Bitch I been waitin for like a fuckin month and a half
Word up baby
No more Mister Nice Guy
What the fuck is the problem?
What's the problem?
Fuck that shit
No more Mister Nice Guy
Fuck you and your pussy
(Bitch)
(Ah yeah)
(What's the matter, you're burning?)

Thinkin bout the times I opened doors and pulled your chair out
But now I got you stressed, lookin a mess pullin your hair out
I used to come and shower you with mad flowers and candies
But all that shit stopped when I got into the panties
Now you're steady beggin me to bang her
I come to bust a nut off of a blow job or fuck you with my finger
Before I got the cunt I was your little rubber-duckie
But now you see me three times a month if you're lucky
I used to buy you clothes as we doze in a pocanose
Now you're gettin called all kinda hoes and a broken nose
Took you out for movies and dinner
Now I pack a snack and rent a blockbuster tape and run up in ya
Before I woulda done anything to see you nude
Now you ??? hump or gotta nease noff like Ebeneezer Scrooge
It ain't no more pickin you up dressed out in a suit and tie
Bitch, no more Mister Nice Guy

Bitch, I'm tellin you right now
It wasn't all that
Aw fuck you
I don't want it no more
Suck my dick
Fuck your pussy
This stinks

When we first went to bed I used to leave your head spinnin
But now I hit quick and give a speed stick while in it
Yeah, I used flip you like Jack the Ripper the stripper
Now I'm ready to date when I get lipstick on my zipper
Just give me a cut, and all of a sudden
I'm steady (nuttin) (nuttin) right on your shirt buttons
So get a grip as my tip starts to sprinkle
It drips from your lip to your hip to your ankle
And that's for all the times you used to try to play me, baby
My name ain't Miss Daisy, but thanks for the ride, lady
Because you rode me like a hoe inside a rodeo
And now the nitwit is moby dick-whipped like Toby-o
I wish you would light a cigarette that I chain smoke
The only coat i be puttin on is my raincoat
I used to treat the hookers flier than sky high
But now I'm a wise guy, no more Mister Nice Guy

(You bitch)
Now I hope you bitches understand
I tried to tell you bitches
Suck my dick
Suck my dick
Fuck all you bitches
Fuck y'all
No more Mister Nice Guy
Suck my dick and suck my nipple
Suck all our dicks bitch
Fuck you

No more Mister Nice Guy
I don't give a fuck no more bitch, now I'm maaaad
No more Mister Nice Guy
Come on, you bitches

Fuck that bitch
I'm really mad now
I'm telling you
You really got me pissed off
I can't have the pussy no more?
Fuck that bitch
Even if I have to take it
Don't make me take it
I'm tellin you

Trilogy of Terror,Road To The Riches,1989.0,"I run rappers like races, cut 'em like razors
Burn 'em like lasers, and stun 'em like phasers
Cause my brain thinks and it blanks your memory banks
Sharp as shanks and poetry is like Big Hank's
Give me a pen, a typa-writer then
I'll cut your whole posse into gingerbread men
With diction, sparked from friction
Plenty of dope like the pope cause it's a G Rap prediction
Power going outer space, louder bass
Replaces the weak rap race
Ashes to ashes, flashes of smashes and crashes
Another big man bashes
Fright; it's a silent night, but it's a violent fight
My talent might explode like dynamite
Lyrics blast out, all evil will cast out
Fast and at last all rappers passed out
Wax the vocal tracks all out like whistles
Clear like crystals, loud like pistols
Here to get it straight for the '89 era
This is a killer G
In a trilogy of terror

Uh
Yeah

Lightning and thunder, rappers going six feet under
Kool G Rap makes you wonder
No blunders or mistakes, this takes hard concentration
Effort, for the method, meditation
Visions of bright collisions, tight decisions
Suckers'll end like divisions
Listen I'm like a seed from a demon, a blessing from an angel
Way more mysterious than Bermuda's Triangle
Riddle fit to hit, put together bit by bit
Like a do-it-yourself kit
Then I'll hold your soul on a remote control
So-called MC's will freeze so cold
Then get viewed and examined in a test tube
If you're a square, you freeze into an ice cube
Talent switches, words to riches
You get stitches, rhymes are wicked like witches
Horror, terror, pain, rip like a hurricane
Freeze like cocaine, or you get a smoke brain
G Rap, Polo, Doc the Butcher all together
We're forever

Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous,Rated XXX,1986,"I hop into the hot tub
To lay back and relax and get a scrub and a back rub
Sippin on some wine
The view is dope, you see the Manhattan skyline
I got it made in the game
No stress, no worries, the only pain is the champagne
Put on the silk bathrobe
I liveth the life, plus I been around the globe
Throw on a Barry White tape
While girls file my fingernails and feed me grapes
Step on a paddy-o and look at the city
No need to look for a girl, I got three right here with me
I'm gettin paid all at once
And I got money in jackets I didn't wear in five months
Nothin come up but fast bread
And I be countin it all while I'm layin in a brass bed
I got a maid and a chauffeur
Girls comin over, sit on a plush leather sofa
I got a smile on my face
Bank accounts and Chase group signings inside my pillow case
Now I'm livin kinda fat
Cause I came from the street and made a g with a rap
Now you know what my name is
G Rap livin the lifestyles of the rich and the famous

Lookin TV, which one you wanna watch, gee?
Cause I got Sony, JVC, Magnumvox and Hitachi
See high prices are little to me
My suits are suede, plus robes are made in Italy
Spendin money like water
Rich men across the border offer me their daughter
And I'm never in a slump
Cause my big pockets got more lumps than Donald Trump's
Pretty women in my face, see
Took Gayle to Bloomingdale's and met Tracy at Macy's
Suckin on money like a vacume
Never got it hard, cause I got credit cards that are platinum
Not to mention the gold Visa
Got a safe in the wall behind paintings of Mona Lisa
Chandeliers in the hall
Ten stuffed deer heads are on my living room wall
More bills than Stills & Nash
I like to flash, cause I got more stash than Johnny Cash
Gold faucets on my sinks
Inside of my bedroom I got at least 20 fish tanks
I got power, and I'm known
See, I can call the President up straight on that red phone
So now you know what my game is
It's the lifestyles of the rich and the famous

I get the opposite sex
Cause while I write out checks, diamonds are shinin in my Rolex
My clout is outrageous
I'm on the phone with the owners of casinos in Las Vegas
Lookin heavy every day
I wear a pair of shoes once, and I'm throwin em away
Everything is like a breeze
I hired MP's just to guard all my ki's
Girls throwin lillies in my path
I got a yacht that makes the Love Boat look like a life raft
Mega-mega-mega-bucks
To make a deposit, I gotta call up armored trucks
Smilin while I'm stylin
I gave a girl her first lesson in sex on the Virgin Islands
Cause I'm the real money maker
More bread than a baker, the dead-president undertaker
A young brother gettin notes
I flew to London for the fog, just because I had the coat
So much money to spill
Whoever's not in my will might even get a mill
You want a car? That's miniture
No cash, don't sweat it, because my credit is my signature

On the Run (Dirty Untouchable Version),UnKnown,1992.0,"You be careful crossin the street
Hey mister, wait!
Mister, wait!
You forgot your things

I got a job with the mob, makin g’s
Doin some pickups, deliveries and transportin keys
Yeah they got me like a flunkie, money
I’m drivin' around with ten kilos inside my trunk
And I’m holdin the suitcase
With a half a million dollars on my lap in front of my face
And I’m tryin to ignore it
But sometimes I get tempted to go dip and make a run for it
The thought alone makes me shiver, damn
What if I get caught? they’ll find me floatin in the hudson river
But if I escape, I’ll be in shape for my life
But they might, get my kid and my wife
See I’m supposed to make a stop
To an uptown spot, run up the block and make another drop
But I got somethin else in mind
So at the next stop sign I pull out and load up the nine
I got the money and the hit
Went through the block nonstop cause I ain’t droppin off a block of it
Then I thought of a plan
So I drove to my house and got my girl and my little man
C’mon baby, pack your stuff, get ready
(Damn, why your face all sweaty?)
Just hurry up, don't throw no fits
I’m a dead man walking, understand, we gotta split
I switched the locks on the door
Started packin' us Gucci bags like I was goin on a world tour
Grabbed the luggage and the gun
C’mon we gotta go, you gotta brother on the run

Mobster: They gotta the shipment
Don: What?
Mobster: They got the whole shipment
Don: I want that son of a bitch dead, I want him dead! I want him dead, I don't care....

Now I’m drivin and I’m lookin at my passport
I’m outta here soon as I hit Kennedy Airport
Loaded the other automatic
I don’t believe this, I'm like a sitting duck stuck in traffic
I’m gettin nervous as hell G
A lincoln continental pullin right up beside me
Puts down my girl and then I bent low
Bullets are flying through my window
The enemy is on attack
Drew the nine and cocked the hammer and I fired at the guinea's back
I gotta take my respect
My bullets hittin crazy mafia members in the neck
Looked at my girl, a bullet struck her
Put in another clip, cause I ain’t givin up nothin my brother
Hit me rollin up in trenches
Sprayin at my car, only missin me by little inches
Stepped on the gas pedal, how bad my girl is harmed?
Man they only hit her in the upper arm
Now I’m drivin on sidewalks, makin sharp turns
My son is in the back catching heartburns
I got the car shakin' wildly
I made a turn, and then I ditched the bimmer in a dark alley
They drove right past, now all this chasin stuff is done
Yeah they got a brother on the run

Don: I want Him dead!
I want his family dead!
I want his house burnt to the ground!
I wanna ...

The next thing I know, it was daylight
And I been sleepin with the engine running all night
I started pullin on my ho
(What man what?) Wake up stupid, we gotta go!
Pulled out the alley, then I dipped
Looked down and picked up the nine and put more rounds in the clip
You know I’m headin south no doubt
Don’t care about my whereabouts, as long it’s a hideout
Finally we crossed the border, I pulled into a station
To fill up the tank, and get a drink of water
Pullin over to park my ride
That’s when I noticed this limousine comin up on my left side
Then the sucker started rammin' me
Then I looked, it was the Luciano family
Looked at my girl she started cryin
My finger on the trigger, pulled it- bullets started flyin
Now I’m hittin all them bastards
I’m droppin em fast, while I blast the blood splashes
Then I finally done it
I took em all out, but I caught one in the stomach
Now I’m lookin for survivors
So I ran up on the side of the car, and hit the driver
And then I laid low
Catchin' breath the only one left was Don Luciano
So I snuck up on the sucker
Put my gun to his head, whassup now motherfucker?
He said, wait, I want to talk
(three gunshots) I put his brains on the sidewalk
Another life I had to waste
He fell on his back, and then I spit right in his guinea face
He saw the barrel of the devil’s gun
Now they no longer got a brother on the run",https://genius.com/Kool-g-rap-and-dj-polo-on-the-run-dirty-untouchable-version-lyrics
Play It Kool,Wanted: Dead Or Alive,1990.0," Rakim (cut and scratched x3 by Polo)

I play it Kool, gettin' into it just like a jazz player
Your record player ain't nothin' without the funky rhyme sayer
Kool G. Rap, 'cause to the little I'm an idol
Attackin' the vital parts to maintain my title
The suckers panic, to the ladies I'm romantic
And gigantic just like the Atlantic ocean
As I flow in slow motion
And I be cookin' you suckers like tan lotion
The K-double-O-L G R-A-P and P-O-L-O
Would like to say hello to you mellow fellow
What are you, yellow? You're hidin' like a coward
And I don't allow it, you get devoured 'cause you can't cope
'Cause I'm dope and you don't have a prescription
So just walk like an Egyptian
My instrumentals ain't up for rental
But come and try 'em, and if you wanna buy 'em, then I supply 'em
I got the source of an orchestra
But if you don't pay the cost to the boss, then I'm forcin' ya
You said you're ready like Freddie to battle me
But the real Freddie's Dead and I ain't Curtis Mayfield
All wise with four Is like Mississippi
You try to trip me, but I just play it Kool just like a hippie
To be like G, this is the number one rule: Play It Kool
 
Rakim (cut and scratched x3 by Polo)

I just glide, these are the tales from the brainside
With lyrics and the beats I provide, they collide to form a homicide
You get dragged in a big bag
Soundwaves ricochet, so watch 'em zig-zag
Off angle, but I'm in shape like a triangle
I need a sucker to strangle, with my new single
All rhymes are terrifyin', you're dyin'
You might as well be in a cage with a mountain lion
When I hear the bell ring, I'm swingin' head level
Burnin' your block, my rhymes hotter than Red Devil
So peel off like a potato
'Cause I play it Kool like the music inside a elevator
Doc Da Butcher is a true blue musician
I'm gettin' busy while suckers are goin' fishin' or out to lunch
As they munch and they crunch on a bunch of stellar rhymes
So I just give 'em a Hawaiian Punch
And let 'em stagger, givin' 'em lipstick and they Mick Jagger
Lyrics are sharper than a dagger
Agony, yeah, I'm braggin', nobody's baggin' me
To the bedroom, your girlfriend is draggin' me
I make the hits radios won't swing, but that's OK
Hey, 'cause everythin' is still Kool And The Gang
Let's party 'cause everybody plays the fool
But I play it Kool
 
Rakim (cut and scratched x6 by Polo)

I play it Kool, makin' you kneel, squirm and squeal
My name ain't Rodney but I'm standin' on the Dangerfield
And my shows, I bust 'em out just like a virgin
'Cause I get stupid, but I'm smarter than a brain surgeon
G. Rap is here to bury
So duck MC's, I send 'em to the Pet Cemetery
Your whole crew turns chicken when they finish watchin' you die
So please stand by as I fry
You're kinda sour, so I dip you in some flour
Read my book, it says cook for about an hour
Ring the dinner bell, brain cells are well done
It's time you got a story, don't tell none
So this here is the only I'm sane
So play it Kool, or you'll be headin' for the deadpool
I play it Kool-er than a band in the North Pole
But I never freeze up or catch a cold
Never stiff, I shoot the gift kinda swift
Try to riff, and you'll needin' a facelift
'Cause I'm a teacher and a trainer, a preacher and an explainer
World's greatest entertainer
I approach like a coach to the umpire
And like live wire, I'mma start a dumb fire
This is Kool G. Rap, the principal of the new school
'Cause I play it Kool

Lyrics that I'm bringin keep you swingin like a monkey
Music is so dope, you'll be one funky junky
G Rap is the name, ""Keep it Swingin'"" is the title
( ? ) dance DJ Polo is your idol
Here's somethin you can bump inside your jeep and keep it thumpin
You're probably with a little crooked hooker I be humpin
I haven't been out lately but you suckers cannot play me
The K, the double o, the l, the G, the R, the a-p
From time to time I'm through with suckers, reppin when I'm steppin
I'm tellin you don't sleep because I always keep a weapon
I run up on your block packin a Glock automatic
Niggas act like they want it, then I'm lettin niggas have it
I'm ( ? ) misses but I never kissed a mister
I reminisce I miss playin the twister with your sister
See, Polo keeps you hoppin, I just keep your fingers poppin
The daddy does the shoppin and your mommy does the moppin
I rag and tag and drag and bag a hooker in a minute
You offer me the bully, better believe I'm goin up in it
I put a hooker lips right on my tip so she could sip it
Then takin off the gear, then I just tear it and I rip it
She's not givin me head, within the bed is where I take her
So humpin as I'm pumpin and I'm shootin like a Laker
I'm bangin, all my fingers touch your button, got you singin
Showin I let off to leave em hangin, keep it swingin

Keep it swingin like a monkey

Keep it swingin
Keep it swingin like a monkey
(Swing it like this, swing it like that)
Keep it swingin
(That) (that) (that) (that)
Music is so dope, you'll be one funky junky

I know a girl, Abbey and Abbey is a hippie
She likes to sip the tippy so I call her Mississippi
I thought that I should keep her but she's a half-stepper
So Abbey met a boy named Peter Piper pick a pepper
Now Peter was a pussy and he made her be hyper
See, Peter picked peppers but he would never pipe her
So one day Abbey went to Peter, told him stop pickin'
She opened up her puddy and Peter put his tip in
Peter started pumpin' with a powerful aggression
Peter pushed to pull and Abbey finished the session
Peter said, ""Ah Abbey, how I'm doin?"" she said, ""Sloppy
The way you pump your Peter you will never be a poppy
Peter got pissed off and said, ""Least my hair ain't nappy""
Abbey said, ""Now that ( ? ) Peter, are you happy?
He took a sip of ripple so he could really rip her
Pulled down his zipper, pulled out his big dipper
Peter put in his pecker and started to pump
He made Abbey so happy she started to jump
A month later stretch marks begin to welp up
Peter called Dr. Pepper to come over and help her
Abbey caught an appetite, Peter fed her supper
To keep her awake he had to get her number(?)
Dr. Pepper came and he told Peter, ""Maybe
You and Abbey's gonna have a baby""
Swing it


I rip up, blow you rappers like little pieces of paper
I book and then I look at all you hookers get the vapors
So press up on me, ho, cause I'm a pro, not a beginner
No frontin' on a stunt, I go up in her like a winner
You know I'm with whatever, if you suckers got some static
We can solve it with revolvers or we bring some automatics
I never riff, I smoke em like a spliff when I get with em
So shorty, let's get naughty and just kick that different rhythm
(Swing it like this, swing it like that) Keep it swingin'
I drop you like a brick, you go and kick it to your mother
Cause like Paul Simon said, there's 50 ways to leave your lover
So if you think you're gettin' to my bank I find another
If I can't make a hit I take the shit out on your brother
I'm always strapped because I put a cap up in a nigga
And some niggas are bigger so I'm quick to pull a trigger
Bang-bang-bang and now your eardrums I'm ringin'
Next time you wanna step to me you better keep it swingin'",https://genius.com/Kool-g-rap-and-dj-polo-keep-it-swingin-lyrics

Die where they bust at, my murderous guys
Slinging them pies where they lust at, or corners where they hang most
Name boast and bank toast
Drive with the thing close, slide where the dames most
Empty clips in them out, coke fiends are strung out, broke niggas bum out
Chicks holdin they gun out, when back streets are taped up
Bodies laying faced up, cats running with ace up
The spots get 'em paced up, the street lamps are broke now
Mad bitches to bone now, when niggas peep your home out
And flip when they zoned out, thugs bringing the street war
Bust shots let the heat roar, taking trips to be more
With bricks upping to fiend off, the towns where they spray shit
Bust rounds and lay shit, selling pounds' a great shit
And clowns get there face lift, spots where gats pop off
Shots clear the block off, slugs knock your block off
And have you licking hot sauce
(Chorus)
On the corners where the dice roll, and clubs where the ice glow
Dames get their life stole, and bleed from my life oh
Niggas laying they law down, some draw with a four pound
P J's are tore down, thoughts of laying hoes down
(The streets) blocks where they lick shots, and rock what the fifth got
Kids cop the six drop, from brick box and zip locks
Towns where niggas kill at, posting where its real at
Keeping gats concealed at, see a fo' you peel at
Strip where you get ripped off, hot lead get licked off
Fronting and your clicks off all your jewels get stripped off
Sidewalks where they creep up, get locked up with a street bop
Kids running with heats up, lifting both of your feets up
Niggas they let their guns loose, they wild guns loose
Gather up under the chin, blow a niggas shit through the sun roof
Decide where they pack nines, the chrome glass shines
You try to clap mine, you outta line niggas get flat lined
(Chorus)
Now Chickens'll get your crew laced, for rocks and a blue face
Niggas giving they screwface, for the loot and the suitcase
Spots that blood spills on, and dealers clock a 'mil on
Murderers get their kill on, mad cats are still on
Beef turning to combat, for life so they punk at
Little kids they harm that, put bombs where your moms at
Niggas tied up and kidnapped, and smacked up with big gats
Get found with they wig cracked, leave 'em right where they live at
(The streets) running for red beams, blood flowing in red streets
Mad fellas with breast sceams running from the FED team
Little shorties are knocked up straight giving their crouch up
Juveniles decide to pee now with they ox up
Crack blocks and weed spots the fiends in the deep spots
Some rollin in three drops others ain't gotta beep bop
Bitches that get their hoe on smoke dope on and so on
Spotted nigga with glow on with dick they could blow on
(Chorus) 2x
(Talking)
