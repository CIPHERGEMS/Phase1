Tell Me When to Go,My Ghetto Report Card,2006.0,"Tell me when to go... Tell me when to go
Tell me when to go... Tell me when to go
Go dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Tell me when to go... Tell me when to go
Tell me when to go... Tell me when to go
Go dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb

Ooh. Jesus Christ had dreads, so shake em
I ain't got none, but I'm planning on growing some
Imagine all the Hebrews going dumb
Dancing on top of chariots and turning tight ones
Ooh, tell me when to go (dumb)
Talking on my Ghettro on the way to the store
My second or third trip
Some Henny, some Swishers and some Listerine strips
Dr. Greenthumb lips, just to ease my thoughts
Not just the cops, but the homies you got to watch
The moon is full, look at the dark clouds
Sitting in my scraper, watching Oakland Gone Wild, ta-dow
I don't bump mainstream, I knock underground
All that other shit, sugarcoated and watered down
I'm from the Bay where we hyphy and go dumb
From the soil where them rappers be getting their lingo from

Tell me when to go... Tell me when to go
Tell me when to go... Tell me when to go
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Tell me when to go... Tell me when to go
Tell me when to go... Tell me when to go
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb

I'm off that 18 dummy juice
Nigga, Raggaman, labeled the Black Zeus
King of the super duper hyphy (hyphy, hyphy, hyphy, hyphy)
Pipey in your wifey, you don't like me
(Like me, like me, like me, like me)
From the Bay to the A
Put me in a Backwood, Swisher sweet blunt, orange lace
(Let's go, it's dope) It's just some shit I wrote
My city couldn't be saved by John the Pope (John the Pope)
I slid past on the gas with the bitches at me
It's good, it's good like the granddaddy
Cross game, you get flipped like a burger patty
Or zig-zagged, pass me a big old fatty
I drink white, with a snow bunny
Talking big shit in the scraper, going hella dummy
1800, Jose Cuervo
Yadadamean? Yadada I'm saying though?

Tell me when to go... Tell me when to go
Tell me when to go... Tell me when to go
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Tell me when to go... Tell me when to go
Tell me when to go... Tell me when to go
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb

Now let me direct traffic for a minute
(talk to 'em)
Now, let me tell you about this hyphy movement we got going in the Bay
When I say something you say it right back to me, you smell me?
We're gonna do it like this right here
Ghostride the whip, ghostride the whip
Ghostride the whip, ghostride the whip
Now scrape, scrape, scrape, scrape
Now scrape, scrape, scrape, scrape
Put your stunna shades on
Put your stunna shades on
Put your stunna shades on

Now gas, brake, dip, dip
Gas, brake, dip, dip
Shake them dreads, shake them dreads
Shake them dreads, shake them dreads
Let me see you show your grill, let me see you show your grill
Let me see you show your grill, let me see you show your grill

It's 1993 and niggas need to miss me be savin' these hoes
You know how these tricks be, be buyin' 'em clothes
Wanna taxi hoes on vogues with the beat
And have 'em sittin' next to 'em in the front seat
But not B see I'm a hog up out the V
And my motto, is fuck a ho and hit the throttle
To the smoke talkin' on my Okie doe
World wide I got a clydes up in Tokyo

Look up in the sky it's a bird it's a plane
What's that nigga's name?
Captain save a ho, mayne!
More faster than a speeding bullet
To put on his cape his card
I pulled it fake the fake the funk the funk
To me that's not the way to do it
Captain muthafuckin' Save a Ho came to me
Flexin just like a little ol' bitch
All up in front of my company
Had to check his ass with an ear check thump and punk him
Talkin' to him while I'm beatin' his ass
Pumpin' fear talkin' bout nigga you gone retrospect somethin here

Yeah, you wanna kill me cuz I fucked ya bitch
You should've had your cape on tight that night
Cuz a nigga like the Shot sho plugs 'em right
And now yo bitch is straight callin' me lovin' me
On the under for the porno star that I be
And don't you come in my face with that trick shit
You better try some more shit

I got the gift to grab any bitch
That I want but I don't
Cuz bitches now a days will get you caught up in some funk
Oh no, I'm not tryin' to save you hoes 'n
How come when I was broke you wasn't brown nosin'?
The other day you see me smobbin' down Magazine
With some ol' nigga in your car lookin' at me mean
I stopped in the middle of the street
Reached under seat to grab my heat
Man that's the same motherfucker
That I got into it with at the club last week

Man them niggas can't fade
They bitch made
And so they start
But niggas with no heart
Don't want no part, to this
Nigga rollin' with the Funk Mobb
And when it's funk
The pump will spit them double laws
So what you doin' when we roll through you hideout
I let my mack get off and then I rides out
With your ass there smokin' like an incense
You savin' hoes nigga and that's bitch shit

Ah is a, Ah is a, Should I save her?
I want to be saved!

I'm crossin' up niggas and bitches
And even snitches just for my riches
Captain Save A Ho
I ain't got no problem with that ol shit
I gives a damn as long as he's payin'
It ain't my fault because he's sprung off my land
I'm takin GA checks, go to the bank Hank
If your breath stank, you get ganked main
Long as a trick comes fallin' down
That gets me all the sets to put on my suit and clown

But make that nigga take care your kids
Make that nigga call your kids his
Make that nigga get out there and work
Make his ass buy you a Dooney & Burke
It's all part of that nigga take care of me
Pussy whipped nigga come save me
Bitches out there be on the look out

All my niggas really want the money
All my niggas really want the money
All my niggas really want the money
We don't want nothing else nigga, I promise
All my niggas really want the money
All my niggas really want the money

All we want is the money, the mozzarella, Galbani
I got more guns than the army, can't let no bitch nigga harm me
I got that purple like Barney, I got two bitches that's horny
They say they niggas is corny, they never there and they lonely
They bought a bottle of 'trony and now they ready to blow me
If you know me you owe me, that's what I told her for sho'
I'm a mac just like Goldie, me and my cronies and brodies
Rollies and stogies, stay with them fifties and forties
That's us if you smell smoke, cookies the antidote
Puffing that rope-a-dope, my partner's they kinfolk
They rap and they sell coke, bust ya head like a cantaloupe
In the summer, a peacoat, my iPhone is jailbroke
Leanin' like the Tower of Pisa, promethazina
Sweatin' like we under a heater, it's hot in here
All them suckers that's talking crazy, they not in here
Never tell my right ear what my left ear hear

All my niggas really want the money

We don't want nothing else nigga, I promise

I'm up before the sun up, the work it be uncut
I break it in pieces and tell your auntie to run up
Shooters keep guns up, snitches get tongues cut
Talk to the peoples, and get your daughters and sons touched
I'm up in the Chevy, we bangin' blow job Betty
I just whipped up the 80, so hit my phone when you're ready
Turkey bags of that loud, we ain't fuckin' with reggie
Tractor-trailer with pounds just touched down up 
Then I'm off, 'bout to hit another Lick
‘Bout a 150 bucks, for that tax on every zip
Gerber bottles of that lean, tax on every sip
'Cause they got the Qualitest and I got the Actavis
So I'm rollin', rollin', thizzin' off that molly
Stuntin', stuntin', no hands on the Ducati
My big homie E-40 put me on the Carlos Rossi
Just a youngin and a muscle
Got the game from Charlie Hustle, come on

All my niggas really want the money
We don't want nothing else nigga, I promise
All my niggas really want the money
All my niggas really want the money
All my niggas really want the money
We don't want nothing else nigga, I promise
All my niggas really want the money
All my niggas really want the money

Pockets will advance, clear the room
If the bitch ain't with the shit, then your boy don't approve, see
Hennessy, Bacardi turns the party, aye
Backwoods pre-rolled, club get foggy, see
Niggas mean muggin', well leap then froggy
Though I see why you mad, her ass applauding
And that's your bitch, she flips like dolphins
See, we gon' work out and bounce the bed springs, ugh
No credit cards, just debit and large cash
Got a real big bag, smell like a forest, see
I used to sell weight 'til gastric bypass, ugh
Pass with a Mac that smack your car glass
Addicted to ballin', no Timbs, ate Wheaties
And learned from Dude Dawg, he taught be greedy
King East Bay, E-40, boss leany, ugh
Money all there, ugh, your money Houdini
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Straight Out The Dirt,UnKnown,2017.0,"I went from nothin' to somethin'
I had to make the shit work
Came up from nothin'
I got it straight out the dirt
I got it straight out the dirt
I got it straight out the dirt
I got it straight out the dirt

My granddaddy helped build the Carquinez Bridge
Gave my grandmama eleven kids
A gallon of milk and some eggs in the fridge
A pack of Top Ramen some bread and some grits
I got it straight out the dirt (the dust)
Checkin' more cash than a clerk (that's us)
Play with me you will get hurt (I'll bust)
I'll put a hole in your shirt (whoa)
The bigger the cap the bigger the peelin', I'm drillin'
Anybody that wanna stop me makin' millions (whoa)
The longer the barrel, the stronger the bullet, the trigger
I'll pull it, I'll have your family in their feelin's
One foot on the strineets, one hand on the bible
I pray for my frenemies, pray for my rivals
Got trademarks and entities, licenses, businesses
No female tendencies, niggas is bitches
From the concrete streets to the golf course (golf course)
When I'm in L.A. I'm at the Waldorf (Waldorf)
If I'm in the mood for an entrée
Napa Valley reservations at The French Laundry
Free all my people in the belly of the beast (of the beast)
Pay the tithes to my church and my priest (and my priest)
In the box, in the cage in the bing (in the bing)
If I went to jail I won't sing (I won't sing)
Biatch!

Fuck police, no respect for the pigs
On the stage steady screamin' ""Free Jig""
I go crazy every time that I hit
Send my yougin's for to break in your crib
I pay 'em double, just send me the bricks
Shooter like Scottie I ain't talkin' Yo Gotti
That white full of low I'm gonna come where it is
Get out yo body we gon' split your wig
I ain't no rabbit, them tricks for them kids
.40 and that Glock, I still walk with that sig
Ain't who he claim to be and I can see it
I'm who he wanna be but he can't be it
These niggas be dissin' but no I don't hear it
My youngin' that youngin' off Good Fellas
He don't got no name, he a cold stepper
I spent them racks on some Margielas
I signed my deal up in blood letters
My Cuban link half a kilo
Bitch so heavy I could use it as a weapon
All us getting' money

Catch a Fade,The Block Brochure: Welcome to the Soil 3,2012.0,"Jumping off the front porch with a new approach
Don't approach me with the bullshit
I remote to a location where the broom sit
Here I go street sweeper Monday through Friday
If not go we can catch a fade, catch a fade, catch a fade
Catch a fade, catch a fade, catch a fade, catch a fade

Pulling up and hopping out
Shell, catch it poppin' out
And I ain't never been a Tom or a Jerry
Pussy or a Rat, pussy on my nutsack
Carry plenty Kenny tats, give me that, give me plenty fetti
Federales on my back, pack them in the cemetery
Send a scary hit out on your messenger
I'm ignorant to wrestle a gorilla in the center of an Acura Integra
I'm pissed off, so I piss off rooftops
Drinking through a straw, fuck a rent-a-cop
I'm hot, I'm napalm when the beat slap like eight palms
And I wear eight charms, every airport alarm
Go off till they tackle me, what I do wrong?
Nigga it ain't 'bout the chain, nigga you the fucking bomb
Bomb on a bitch nigga then his bitch later
Put the tips on the bitch, nigga you a fucking waiter
I don't even want a favor, I just want a fair one
And it's like that till the sheriffs come

I'm in the party, feeling like me
S-I-C-K with TDE
Your bitch want sex and my ear like wax
And this Landy got her ready to get it hit from the back
She shows up chump, salute give daps
Get your face flat, you don't want that
Get your nose tapped, you don't want that
Get your life fucked up all over a batch
Get cropped, get chopped on your head like a barber shop
Have it out in the parking lot

Mouthpiece faster than a speedboat
Keep it one hundred like a C-note, pea coat
Po-po tryna decode lingo
Not drunk but I'm finna be hella twisted
Lifted like a toilet seat, grown ass kid
My bitch always telling me, I ain't shit
She hate me, but she love my dick
Trapper factor macker having money like a rapper
Bumping local talent pulling up with the blabber
Patna wanna challenge 'cause my pockets hella fatter
But he gone be unlucky like walking under a ladder
Put hands on a man, fuck unity
Ain't nothing between us, but space and opportunity

My shit bang, my shit bang
My shit bang, my-my shit bang
Nigga my shit bang, bang, bang, bang

My shit bang, my shit throb
I'm a motherfucking beast, I'm a motherfucking hog
Pull up with the slump
Or should I say black truck sounding like I got a alligator in the back
Paint wetter than melted ice, ralley and hockey stripes
Burning rubber at every light, mean mugging like 'thug ya life'
I be hustling all day and night, pushing all night and day
Twisted and whipping, yay, getting my Goapele
So you put my Gouda my pay, when I get in my way
From da Bay to L.A. to the A this nigga connected
Worldwide nigga this mister how-you-be-headed
You ain't gotta like me but you gotta respect it
Woke up early in the morning and put one in the air
Got so high thought about running for mayor
Slap myself to make sure I was still there
Shit, showered and shaving then I cut my hair
Today I'm try'na get laid then put a pounding on the mug
Try'na find me a bitch with a ass like a Worldstahiphop bunny
Try'na get rich in this collectings stack my money
You can tell that I'm a D-boy by my baller tummy
Sometimes I dress uppity, sometimes I dress scummy
Sometimes I dress high class, sometimes I dress bummy
If it ain't about no cash you can miss me
Most of the time you can find a hustla tipsy
Biatch, Biatch!

Nigga my shit bang, bang, bang, bang

Uhh! I been running around all day try'na get my decimals up (Up)
Anybody that try to stop me I suggest that they duck
Cause when I get the bucket I can assure you it's nothing pleasant
My arsenal game is east but the west has all kinda of relatives
Even if you're wearing chest protection a trauma plate won't work
Cause I'm a aim at your hammit, I ain't goin aim at you shirt
Alot of these bitch ass niggas should be wearing a skirt
With the box of Motrin and some maxi pads in they purse
Pillow talking and biting pillows, acting like some brizzles
Cause they're a whole bunch of that sucka shit a bunch of popsicles
I should of been a taurus cause I'm stubborn as a bull
I'm a different type of dude and I stick to the rules
I'm a real nigga best believe it, I live it and I breathe it
I tell it like it is and I call it how I see it
My potna used to be all sharp but now he on thee thee
'What do thee thee mean? ' Methamphetamine
I can't believe it, man you disappointed me
I'm devastated mayne he lost cool points with me
I'm standing outside of my crib with some gym shorts and a hoody
Talking to my nig on the celly smoking a philly
Sipping on a fifth of that oil cognac henny
A hundred wall on them bricks, he got caught with a key of candies
If you didn't go to jail by now he probably be dead
So instead he in there with his uncle his daddy and relatives
Uhh!

Richie Rich
]
I'm really not all that sure about when things is finna mature
So lemme find me a nigga with a grip
And hit his ass quick with one of them licks
What's the definition of a lick?
Takin' a nigga's shit 
(ayy, put that on somethin')
I put that on The Click, The Click
Back to fuckin' work, one of the homies just got dusted
Time to do some dirt, uh, I never trusted them bustas
Shot him in the shirt, dead on arrival
Now the town is funkin', it's called survival
What y'all wanna do? 
They got us skunked
(Well if, uh, we can just, uh—)
If it was a fifth, we'll all be drunk
I'm heated, them niggas cheated, played me false
We had a meetin', shit 'posed to been squashed
I noticed one killer on the double dribble and set him up, y'all
She likes the Monie in the Middle, play tetherball
Thick-ass bitch, high yellow city-slicker
Scarecrow creepin' Southern bitches, a.k.a. Posie Pussyfictitious

Nigga been holdin' guts
But shit on hisself and a funky bill
Pullin' out bills, frontin' on material shit
That's when I get to killin' shit (killin' shit)
And settin' him up and havin him catchin' a couple of slugs
Slu–uh–slu–uh–slugs
Tryna fuck with savage thug
Pistol pop in they ass
See, niggas be gettin' this twisted
It's that bitch that killed ya
Took all your money, peeled ya
Seven niggas bust in the room with AKs
While a nigga be puttin' on his jimmy
All of a sudden they shoot up your nutsack
Before you can hit the broccoli
See money-a-made that nigga, that nigga didn't make that money
Left them niggas jacked up, and the bitch she macked him
He's a busta, punk ass nigga, don't know the streets
That's why that nigga naked layin' dead in between some bloody sheets
It's just a part of the game he didn't feel
Bitches will kill, fuck a nigga, out his last d-uh dollar bill
You don't know that ho, mayne, that bitch can't be trusted
Dusted and di-motherfuckin'-sgusted

(Some cold hearted shit)
Back to fuckin' work, one of the homies jus got dusted
What y'all wanna do; what ya'll wanna do?
(Cold hearted bitches)
Back to fuckin' work, one of the homies just got dusted
What y'all wanna do? I never trusted them bustas
(Some cold hearted shit)
Back to fuckin' work, one of the homies jus got dusted
I never trusted them bustas
(And it's them cold hearted nigga)
Back to fuckin' work, one of the homies just got dusted
Dusted and disgusted

Let's let off some 2O3s on the other side of t-uh-town
Draw the attention on the other s-uh-side of town (other side of town)
And wait for the po-po shift to change, ghetto shootin' range
Revenge on the r-uh-rebound, war games
Droughts, ouch, lost clientele but I will prevail
By sellin' the broccoli dank instead of the crack cocaine trumps
That steal narcotics
When it's funkin' season, bitches be the reason
Why the smoke be coming up out the chop, with my nigga 'Pac

Dear God, can you forgive me? My future's lookin' sick
I'm in my rag hittin' switches, I'm suspicious of these bitches
I keep on, calllin', but ain't nobody pickin' up
I think she's stallin', this evil bitch is tryin' to set me up
Came all alone—if it's on, then it's on
Bust my motherfuckin' chrome, on these jealous niggas' dome
It's a war zone (War zone) but I'm a man, so with gun in hand
I'm on my way to see this ho, you know the fuckin' plan
Can't understand, but the things ain't the same
You could die over these bitches, if you slippin' in the game
Niggas gangbang, but bitches gangbang too
Give up that good thang, nigga put that pistol to your brain
If you a smart figure, don't have no love in your heart, nigga
Any complications pull the trigger, dusted and disgusted
Bitches can't be trusted, you know the rules
They underhanded, she planned it, you fuckin' fool

(Richie Rich: These hoes out here tryin' to hold niggas hostage
So a nigga get his muthafuckin' balls involved)
(2Pac: Things happen when you turn these bitches upside down
What's gonna happen?)
(Richie Rich: Uhh, three and a half dollars or probably fo' will fall out a bitch pocket)
(Mac Mall: Yeah, mayne, them hoes hella stupid
They fuck with mo' MC's than Jack the Rapper)
(E-40: What you say, Mall?
Ay, fuck them sheisty ass bootches, nigga)

The California lifestyle that I live
Where the bitches is crooked and niggas just don't give
A flyin' fuck, so I stay stuck, smokin' on a Taylor
Bay Area player, tryna have shit major
And a bitch won't save ya
So I ain't playin' Captain Save-a-Ho
I mob up in ya like a Brougham and then I'm gone
I'm like Sylvester Stallone, every day is like a Cliffhanger
Action packed, I let the mini-mac sting ya

Them hoes jacked that ass
Nigga woulda got smokin' on that hash
Can't have my cash, better go and take your nigga stash
'Cause he's a busta, niggas with clusters, slippin' and shit
Better jack that nigga 'fore I jack his ass, bitch
Never was no love for the mark-ass, the lo pink (the lo pink)
He let them bootsee bitches gank

Can't let them bootsee bitches gank that ass
Better hide your cash and check her fast
Pump your brakes, nigga; slow your roll, don't go too fast
'Cause bulletproof ain't doin' no good no mo' no mo' no mo' no mo'
Now, niggas comin' up dead with they brains blew out on the fuckin' floor
Damn, hollow points to face, Teflon, through the vest
Now r-uh-rest
Pull a plug on a flatline, no puh-ulse, one nigga less
One nigga less, from coast to coast, to the East to the West
Fresh in the flesh, them bitches play the game of death
Look over your shoulder, watch your back, don't even trust it
I'm tryna told ya, end up dusted

(Some cold hearted shit)
Back to fuckin' work, one of the homies just got dusted
What y'all wanna do; what y'all wanna do?
(Cold hearted bitches)
Back to fuckin' work, one of the homies just got dusted
What y'all wanna do? I never trusted them bustas
(It's some cold hearted shit)
Back to fuckin' work, one of the homies just got dusted
I never trusted them bustas

I can hang
I can hold on keep going till you came

But shit, we just want a help-
Don't want the whole plate
Don't put the two on the ten, don't ever perpetrate
Like a lot of these fools I see on TV
With the Armani, Chanel versus Versace
Why motherfuckers can't be broke sometimes?
Sometimes it's cool to floss
But don't buy an eighty-five thousand dollar car
Before you buy a house
They always said I couldn't rap, I just say bitch
I guess the bitch, made me rich
And now you wanna call me hardcore
While I be steppin out the shower on a marble floor
I pay the IRS taxes, send FedEx and faxes
This industry is like fuckin fat bitches
All work and no play, I do it everyday
Anyway cuz I gotta stay paid, Forty

Say that you got it all

Front row seats at the Ultimate Fights, Shamrock and Severn
Long expensive fa-uh-flights, up there in the heavens
Fat ass royalty checks, fat ass cribs
Smokin' blunts and drinkin' brew on the balcony, barbecuin' ribs
The more scrilla, the merrier
I represent the Yay Area
I walked from Foothill and Havenscourt to Sixty-Seven MacArthur
To Freddie B house to make tapes with my partner
Hit Arroyo Park, we had tapes for sale
Got a paper bag full of that, can't you tell
It's funky, everybody nod they head like this
I said bitch, and everybody read my lips
I got rich, suckin up the game from the O
And even though a lot of rappers got the same kind of flow
I survived cuz I got mo', game than them
It came straight from the prostitutes, players, and pimps
It was my destiny, I came the same every time
So don't question me, I transferred the game into rhymes
I'm not a freestyler, don't rap for free mayne
It's paystyle on mine, cuz I love money mayne
Landrovers
 and Toyota, Lexuses
Six-hundred V-twelve with them big ass motor Mercedeses

Tell me is it true or false

I'm Shorty the Pimp, I come funky
Again and again, they say when will it end?
Maybe never, cause I can still spit it
But I ain't rappin' for cheese, I want meal tickets
Gotta start somewhere, and I'm past that
For the right scratch, I'll be the last mack
So stick yaself Pretty Tony
You tryin' to make a hit, but your shit sounds phony
Not like AT&T but like ET
You can't be me, so would you please see
If you can keep my name out your mouth
Cause you don't really know what the game's all about
It's 'bout feedin' the family, not freakin' in the Benz
Instead of rentin', pay for that roof on your head
And stop pimpin' in your own mind knowin' you a trick
Put your hustle down playa go an hit you a lick
Bitch!

Ballaholic,Charlie Hustle: The Blueprint of a Self-Made Millionaire,1999.0,"You know my.. my whole def-a-nation is to spit straight game
You dig that? (Straight game) I I come from the game baby y'know
I come from this motherfucker, you undersmell that?
Aya, and you know, it's like this nigga
Pimped-out all day you know Hillside Vallejo nigga
You undersmell me? Been speakin the real for many moons
My niggas in the 7-0-7 on down to Compton
I'm in my FUBU drawers, she in her gown
Cause if some cats tryin to have at me
I sick the canine in the background
I'm plannin on splittin my crown but it ain't gon' be too simple
See I'm a baller, I got bars around the window
Rottweilers, pits, aikietas, doberman pischers tanked up in the yard
With a sign on the fence that reads ""warning: beware of dog!""
You play the frog if you feel froggish nigga leap
I neglect my dogs, starvin, sometimes they don't eat
Elroy speak to me about my triple-beam; officer, I got proof
Po'-po', that's for weighin nuts and fruits
Run with a whole bunch of rugged rowdy-ass knuckleheads, knahwhatImean?
Big nigga, the size of a football team
I wear these glasses so that I can look like a square
But if you ever see me in a fight with a bear
Don't help me nigga, help the bear!!
Me and my wales, we be coonin
But see you the type of the nigga that'll go in the backroom
And beep yo'self and act like yo' pager boomin
Yeah man, cause a real tycoon
Gon' take this shit from the flo' to the moon
Still Northstar ridin, six-oh strikin
Switch up V-S cherry chokin the wrist and the pinkie
But keep it loose around the neck and make sure hoes in check
So if you gon' fill a nigga cup, fill it up with paper
Cause we ballaholics bitch, ain't that quiet about this shit
If you're on it spend it like you mean it
Uhh, I'll have you
Ever since I was ankle low to a centipede's claw
I always wanted to play pro-baseball
Weepolization family, that's my favorite sport
But instead I'm back and forth to jail and in and out of court
BEOTCH! Serious about my rock shrine
I don't give a fuck how much courage juice you had
Nigga yo' mug don't mean like mine!
I bring the noise like a cymbal {*CRASH*}
I fuck with 40 dem, make you stick your pistol out the window
BEOTCH! Y'all oughta see me at the state fair
Showin off in front of my broad; tryin to win my lil' nieces
One of the biggest stuffed animal prizes there
Nicknamed Charlie but my street name is Earl
Ballaholic like Felix Mitchell nephew Lil' Darrell
I know these streets like the Task Force know dope
I am the streeets, my ghetto pass can't be revoked
Ten percent, I paid my tithes, forgive me for my sins
Smoke an ounce of weed a day, maybe that's why I ain't go no ends
You see, you niggas real truant mayne
Runnin around here puttin a black eye in the game
When we tryin to feed y'all somethin nutritional for the brain
And nourish yo' game
You see there's two type of niggas in this world:
Those that eat and those that don't
What type of nigga is you, you know?
You see we got the tycoon status
Big hogs, tryin to pile the money up out your trash
You dig?
You can call me Lawry's cause I'm seasoned
I eat crevice, but not when it's bleeding
Don't get me wrong, I love sex but I don't play that part
I love Virginia, but not when the Virginia's tart
Toss me good, and I might Dolce and Gabbana it
Gave yo' ass some bread, and let you go buy up some shit
Callin yourself takin advantage of my riches
I'm tryin to be nice to yo' ass
I normally talk bad about you bitches
Invested to ""Tha Hall of Game"" buggin and bein notorious
For slappin chickenheads upside they weave-a with my Nokia
Mayday mayday, callin all patrol cars and units
Be on the lookout for the Hillside managler, 40-Water the Ballaholic
I'D RATHER FLY THAN RIDE AMTRAK
When I'm in Dallas I fuck with (?), and go hard black
Make an opera singer wanna write some raps
Papered up - like who? Like a fax BEOTCH
I know you didn't say papered up like a fats
(Yeah I did, yeah I did) Yeah, cause we do this shit
Up off the ground on a pitcher's mound
Slidin, to the bad catcher, able to snatch ya
Bat yo' G out the pocket
Run it again with a nigga that's in the socket
And it ain't my problem, if the ho hollerin
We all about dollars, and collar-poppin
Nigga, BEOTCH!!!
Baller, let me explain to you, a ballaholic nigga
Undersmell this nigga

It's that season of the sickness, you're witnessing nigga sittin' spin
I'mma get you addicted when I spit shit, venomous shit, shit again
Shit so much I gotta go to Costco to get my toilet paper
Hit so much, spit so much, grip the pistol up, I'm a skitzo nut
Zeppo rape or keep her safe or he could take her
Chill pill, real deal, kill bill
I might be sick, but that ain't the reason that I still spit real ill
Niggas ain't got no lyrics when I hear it I'm like, ""What's up with that?""
Everybody wanna copy me, so I'm choppin' 'em up, leave rotten meat
I'mma be drama free like my momma be
Suicide before I let a nigga ride on me, that ain't comedy
I don't get, I don't have to get it

From the 707
I’m throwing up the V, bitch
From the 707

I’m a Hillside Kitty Walk nigga of course
You bound to see a nigga do a drive by on a horse
Country-city boy, big corn-fed nigga
40 ounce sipper, discount liquor
On the corner of Magazine and Sonoma Boulevard
Across the street from Grant Street, suicide backyard
Play them boys for false, fuck around and get stolen
They rep that shit hard, shout out to Soulin
I got the munchies 'cause I'm smoking on a log
Went to Bridgeside for some Sac's hot dogs
I'm slapping ""Hubba Head"" the Luvva Twins - Albino Rod
The first record Vallejo record ever pressed up as far as hip hop
Then came M.V.P.:  40, D-Shot, Suga, and B
Then came The Mac, then came Mac D-R-E
They doing the Thizz Dance in front of SolTrans
Everybody activated with a pistol in their pants


I was taking a shit and Cousin Fik hit me up
He said ""40 on the other line,"" I told that nigga ""What?""
Pressed mute, wiped my ass, bounced the fuck up
And started talking business with the boss of where I'm from
The seven hundred and six plus one
I be in the trap with Kyle Nasa in the flats
Was born in '95 and after that it’s been a wrap
I'm a hustla not no rat
I'm about my Gouda I'm about my scratch
I'm heading to the tippy so I’m always on my toes
Times Herald taking pictures for so I'm striking for the pose
My niggas on Alhambra still be playing with their nose
Even if this rap don’t blow I still get money out a ho
I was raised by OGs so it's class in me
I'm allergic to broke bitches so they bad for me
You want a verse from lil Neffy then start cashing me
Bitch I'm from Vallejo muthafucka stop asking me

Hop in this form, bitch, ride with the roller
What's your motive? Them ain't the cops, them the rollers
Flow straight colder, talking sicker than Ebola
Had a tramp out in Rosa and I fucked her good
I found out she was a ho so I kept it hood
Yeah, we counting C-notes like a musical
I'm slapping Young D-Boyz ""Selling Cocaine as Usual""
I went to House of Soul, I need the usual
Never wore a suit but I’m suitable
WataBoys down to the cuticles
Moved to the A, the shit was beautiful
I moved back, start killing niggas, your funeral

Homeboy bought a rollie and his shit get taken
Invisible sets, rockin' like my shit went missing
When the ice hit the light, it twinkle and glisten
If my shooter get shot, then I'mma finish his mission
Currently on my second tour ever, this feels like heaven
They calling me the dude no Devin it's for my sevens
I'ma ride if I'm summoned, I abide by nothin'
I'm my own damn boss, I can put you onto something
And on tuesdays I'm rocking with my Uzi
Slappin' dumb hard tryna knock me off a Toupee
Yolo whippin' and product reppin' Crest Toothpaste
I flip a coin and take a life just like I'm two face
Elevated on my high horse now can't come down

Aye, aye, learn about it
Having so much money it takes me two weeks to count it
Baby girl got kicks, make her booty shake, she got talent
Hit it from the back, her knees shake and  she lose her balance
Woah, woah, hold up, thirty-six, twenty-four, she a double D cup
Doing splits on the floor, bust it open in the club
All them bitches jealous cause niggas showing you love
Popping my collar, drinking my drink, and making my presence known
Vanille Tobacco Tom Ford cologne I got on
You can tell by the way I carry myself I'mma star
These Cartier buffs my face cost more than your car
From a dollar man to a millionaire they stop and stare
Look at my IG, I'm everywhere
That and they just be liking on me cause they know I'm the guy, guy
Blowing this tree put it in the air like wifi

But you on your vegetarian so I order tofu
It's mackin' on mine so you know that I had to pop my P's
I'm from the game, I'm wavy like the Seven Seas
I could do it nice and slow or I could pick up speed
When I leave, your pillow gon' smell like some Creed
You a Chanel wearin', Birkin bag carryin', drop McLaren steerin'

We smoke hydroponics, medicinal chronic
She fresh out of college, she givin me knowledge
She bounce like hydrolics, her coochie's the hottest
It's bald and it's flawless, I gotta be honest
Her legs on my shoulder, we tipsy not sober
I'm checkin her oil, I'm all in her motor
We switchin positions, she wettin the sheets
I'm strokin I'm swimmin I'm divin so deep
Like Michelle and Barack see girl this could be us
Pussy so good that I might wife you up
I could go slow if you want me to rush either way it go I'ma make sure that you nut
Cuz I'm layin this wood like a lumberjack should, earth is my turf and I'm good in my hood
Hustla since birth I can give you a joog, paper I'm worth so get this understood
Fur all on my mini, diamonds in my Cuban lini
Babygirl got good pink, kinky when she drinny
I piked it, she liked it, she got so excited

I throat her, don't bite it, my dick in her titties
She ain't tryna stop me, her pussy was sticky, my fingers inside it


Luda!
I fucked around and put your ass to sleep
She a freaky motherfucker, looking for a bitch ass to eat
She flip that tongue and like all type of flavors
She throw that bomb and I go deep just like an Oakland Raider

I move it in like U-Haul
I’m a red nigga, wear yellow diamonds
And a black car, no blue balls
I gets mine, I dump a load
Now I further cause your ass out
I gets high, I’m hung low
I drop the drawers and the bitch passed out
If I always got to lube it up, then bitch you need to put it up
That pussy you can keep. (That pussy you can keep, baby!)
See, I knew you could do better
Got that pussy a little wetter, than I…. (Yes! Yes! Woo!)

Doggy-style, front to back
Want you to play with these nuts while I’m in that pussy
Got that dick shining baby
Must be going raw in that pussy

Going to be in ya fast and talking shit

Know you feel that pressure, ain’t ya?
Liquor got me stabbing, ainna
Lord will put my hands up on the ass
Lord will grab it, ainna
Average pussy, I can make it dat
Cause I’m an off-the-chainer
Taste that pussy front to back
Had you thinking we married, ain’t ya?
Kids don’t really work for me
I be liking to put on babe
You be howling you nutted already
I’ll be howling “come on babe”
I be trying to take you there
You know I got the recipe

This thing go, for sho'ly
Only bustas I like, is Buster Posey
And the Bay is so trashy, murkish and murky
Crooked cops, crooked dice, they'll do you dirty
When I enter the neighborhood, when I pull up
People gather 'round me like an ice cream truck
They say, ""Uncle 40 waterwhat's the secret to life?""
""I'm trying to get on, I need some advice""
I give 'em some game and then I dip
Off to the next episode, money to get
Can't be slippin' and snoozin' and cattin' off
If you lag, you lose man, your loss
My Ruger won't stutter to put you under the cover
Or should I say ""sheet,"" with a tag on yo' feet
Fetti' by the face ain't complexion as duct tape 
Then it's dark like shadows off the tree, bad apple
Cognac and Snapple sippin, spliffer twistin Swisher Sweets
Smokin and blowin and puffin on some Larry OG
Comin' around the corner, disrespectful-ass beat
Old peep can't sleep, call Johnny Law on me
I don't make it rain, I'm not a cloud
And I don't pay for coochy, coochy pay for me pal

Cracked his shell, got on his head
Throw in the towel or we can take it farther

Two sticks in my hand
I go ape on a fake if that's what he want

Smack it up, flip it, rub it down
Feels so good when you go downtown
I like it when you moan and groan and make that sound
I love to see your face when you do that frown
Don't hold back just do yo' job
Lick it up and down like corn on the cob
Slob on my knob while your pussy throb
Gimme head 'til I'm deader than a fuckin do'knob
Theraputic and healin, couldn't fight the feelin
She pulled my dick back like a banana peelin
Her throat game platinum, worth a million
Put her on the track, we can make a killin
She can wrap her whole mouth around a fireman pole
Suck a tennis ball through a garden hose
Low cut jeans, like to show that flesh
Pierced toungue ring, big lips and breasts
Ecstasy... Hennessy... broccoli... the remedy
Late night creepin at the Embassy
On hard like I'm out the penitentiary
Baby got back like a slab of ribs
Dang near wanna make her have my kids
Take her home, let her meet my mom and dad
Then introduce her to all my nigs
Front back, side to side
Gettin good head while I'm in my ride
Dip to the crib then we do it again
Have a deep throat contest, you and your friends
Like the 4th of July I'm tryin to reach my peak
Pull it out your mouth, now it's time to skeet
Shoot it everywhere while I'm beatin my meat
In your face, in your hair, all over the sheets

If chewing's what your doin, then you best believe I'm comin' back
Black, white, asian, and latino, don't discriminate
Take it out, take it to the face, then ejaculate
Freaky bitch, nasty bitch, my nig' I swear she love this shit
Don't trip pimpin', she gon' swallow it if you bust in it
Look into her eyes, she gon' cum, in the process
Have her panties soakin wet, try to make her choke on it
Deep throat action, hard dick is what I'm packin
When she coughin, when she gaggin, she get pimp, satisfaction
... Got a nigga weak in the knees-ah
Speakin in another toungue, thank you mamacita

Got a family to feed, gotta put some food up on their plate
Sippin this jack and smoking this cali green turtle
Trying to relax and overcome obsticals and hurdles
Haters wanna hold me back because im solid and i'm laced

Four barrel carburetor, four speed tranny
Dual exhaust dipped in sauce

Hold the door open (Hello!)

Filthy McNasties at the bus stop hitchhikin' it
Never reneging or feeling bogus
When it comes to spittin I'm ferocious
Mannish with it, cabbages, savages
Hangin' out the window of the sunroof, ham sandwiches
All day, everyday, 40 play

Burn the duct tape but keep all the ya-yo

Heavy on the Grind Entergainment, Stove Top Productions

Oooooh, Hustlers 'R Us
My game sharper than the elephant's tusk
Me myself and I, the only one that I can trust
Sleep with one eye open, finger on my pistol clutch
I got my hand in everything, I'm real instrumental
I'm as real as they come, ain't got no bitch per-tential
When I was comin up, there's certain things we don't allow
Like long fingernails, and men archin they eyebrow
Here's another thing I don't condone and don't approve
How all of a sudden snitchin became cool? (I don't know)
I'm gamed up, I be chewin on this mack granite
O.G. J.B. stomp down, lace the nigga, 'sposed to never panic
I bump the baddest broad in the whole facilitation
All by way of mouthpiece, just by mind manipulation
I can make it look like I'm at my best when I'm at my worst
Persuade a broad to put on the dress, and break her for her purse

A day in the life on the soil in Cali-scrillya
Take the wrong turn and these youngsters out here'll kill ya
The law ain't concerned, they love us hustlers and dealers
They wanna tear our houses down so they can build some Ikeas
Oooooh - wow! Just tryin to get my point across
Where I'm from it's pandemonium and chaos
Where I'm from the lights is off, we use matches
Where I'm from we do it barefaced instead of ski-masks
Caw-caw-caw-caw, no more talkin on them cells
I heard the fed-a-rel went ahead and bought NexTel
{*chirp*} Oooooh - overcrowded jails
They got us sleepin in the gym instead of our own cells
Oooooh - put our yetti together

My medallion got mo' colors than the peacock feather

Ouhh, I throw the yola in the pot, let it simmer and bathe
Add a little baking soda, make it foam like aftershave
I like to serve my dope wet, cause it weigh a hella lot more
You can smell the residue and the fumes from next door
Ouh, turf superstar, microwaves and pickle jars
Portable digital scales, custom-painted muscle cars
Pimpin', where the razor blade? Use a safety pin
""What they goin fo'?"" Nigga what you trying to spend?
When it's a drought, I just sit on my dope and wait
For the prices to skyrocket and rise like real estate
I got that ice cream, that candy, that girl, that white-white-white
My car's a Charger 2006 Hemi, tight-tight-tight
I'm a d-boy! Bootch! I thought you knew
Just like every other motherfucker in my crew (Bitch!)
Bundle in the bushes, chopper up in the tree
AK will light up your chest like ET

Well, down in the Dirty, South, to be exact
Gettin money with white girls is a well-known fact
I like 'em black, brown, Puerto Rican, or Asian
But nothing bring the bread back like a Caucasian
Whether, winter or fall, summer or spring
A white girl's always down for doing the damn thing (Fo' sho')
Put her on the highway, she ain't no punk
Got a white girl drivin with white girls in the trunk (Hol' up)
I ain't lying, it's the best thing going
When my white girl's around, it's always snowing
Momma can't stand her, telling me to switch
Sayin I'ma go to jail fucking with that white bitch (No shit)
Always around to keep me paid
With some white girls on my team, I got it made
So if you down on your luck, and got no money

I keep a silk broad when I'm fucking with the hard
'Cause they never get stopped by the motherfucking cops
Bootch look hard but this bitch is a fraud
Don't like to see me ball, want me to go rock-for-rock
Move around, bitch, you need to get out the way

Dope around the corner, broken down Pinto

To be the King
It seems I need a killer team to get the green for me
Hit the scene clean in my Chevy, now I'm ready for trouble
Count my rocks, set up shop, collect my fetti and bubble
Faded visions of me as a timer
Though marijuana clouds my vision I'm still watch for drama
Ha-ha
They got me crossed tryin' to be the boss, no one can stop us
Niggas dream of six figures, handle our business in choppers
Feds can't comprehend my ghetto slang, so I evade
And plot and plan a life of better thangs, all about my cheddar main
Help me if I fall, can I ball for life
A half a key in my drawers, bein' cautious like
I wanna rise keep my eyes open
Witness motherfuckers die with they eyes open
My niggas rise smokin'
Any busta bitch tryin' to stop my wish
To have a million dollar spot gettin' riches
Feel me

Bring it on the block, million dollar spot
I can take a chance, I could live in cans
Bring it on the block, million dollar spot

Gimme all your motherfuckin' money all money good money back
Feel me, get money nigga!

Too busy smokin' weed, sellin'
Dope and drinkin'
I guess we're livin' in the last days
Cause in the last days the Bible speaks of AIDS
Plagues, brothers killin' brothers, earthquakes
Youngsters tryin’ to earn stripes, is it worth theys?
I'll be a sucker if I don't pull ya ho card
I used to be soft but now I'm hard, look hear
I'll be a sucka if I don't pull
Your card
Nigga, I practice lookin' hard

I got a mirror in my pocket and I practice lookin' hard
Mirror, mirror make the call
Who's the hardest of them all
I got a mirror in my pocket and I practice lookin' hard
Right before I go to bed
I make sure that my mirror's there

Take yo mean face off partner why ya muggin' me
Fools say nigga, I can't help
That shit's in me
It's automatic cause what's mine they done took
It's my mad at the world
Look
I said I feel ya man, sometimes I catch myself too
Mean muggin' folks that
Did no harm to me or my crew
But now it shouldn't have to be this way
Fools say, I don't care what nobody
Say
The other man got me this way
I'm fresh out the pen and I've been systemized
For years
Been fillin' out all kinds of applications to make a grip
But I don't know nothin' about no computer chip
It takes that to make a J-O-B
In the 93
But a J-O-B in 93 consists of paper rarely
Jobs like the oil refinery
I'd rather work in Napa at the winery
And then ya wonder why I'm stubborn
Forever lookin' hard, I been scarred

I got a mirror in my pocket and I practice lookin' hard
Right before I go to bed
I make sure that my mirror's there
I got a mirror in my pocket and I practice lookin' hard
Mirror, mirror make the call
Who's the hardest of them all

Can't tell me shit, I come from a broken up home
Every since I was a youth I thought that I was grown
Meet me after school nigga and we can get it on
Ya talked about my mammy now I'm goin' upside ya dome
I got a complex problem, my guard stay up
I'm always on the offensive side
Don't test my nuts
I'm not a Johnson nor a Larry but I'm scary
Scared that I might lose it and
Chop you with my piece berry
I deep into my shit and it's straight like that
I be quick to clobber a motherfucker with my Flintstone bat
Nobody likes me on my father's side of the family
They can't stand me cause they think that I'm sellin' that candy
I kid you not, all bullshit to the side
I got 20,000 muthafuckas in my organization
Now which one of y'all niggas down to ride
I gets juiced off the underground ghetto shit
You know that Click shit, that independent shit
It makes me feel like I want to
Got me a baggy full of broccoli and a crooked Ides 22
I feel great, I'm mean muggin', but I feel great

I got a mirror in my pocket and I practice lookin' hard
Right before I go to bed
I make sure that my mirror's there
I got a mirror in my pocket and I practice lookin' hard
Mirror, mirror make the call

Gamed Up,Poverty And Prosperity,2015.0,"I ain't new to this shit, baby
No, no, I'm too grown
Tryin' to run game on me
I been in this too long

I'm gamed up
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm
I'm gamed up
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm
I'm gamed up

Bitch, how the fuck you think you supposed to run game on me?
I could have been a pimp at the age of three
And when it comes to funk, I know a few hitters in that arena
And I ain't talkin' John Cena, I'm with hyenas
Born hustler, not a sucker, but a king
Don't nothin' come to a sleeper but a motherfuckin' dream
All my years I had peers that I looked up to
That been on and off the streets, back and forth to the stew
Sometimes I drink too much, I got three bladders
I'm paranoid, I pack three hammers
I smoke a lot, I got three lungs
I'm looney as fuck like Yuk and Num
How you expect me to help you if you won't help me help you?
I ain't in the way, you in the way of you
I keep my ear to the turf like a soccer shoe
I know these streets like the Gracies know Jiu-Jitsu



Hate come with the plate
When you eatin' everybody want a taste
Turnin' my money over and flippin' it like a acrobat
I got more TracFones than Saul from Breaking Bad
Where I'm from, they'll shank you in a bathroom stall
Where I'm from, they'll deflate yo' head like a Tom Brady ball
Hella long ago before my Mangoscato
I used to spin the gumbo pot like 
Havin' money ain't new to me, I'm a staple
Seasoned like a mu'fucka: basil
I respect my OGs, look up to them like a father
They stay movin' mean, up in the pen they shot callers
I went from not even being mentioned to the center of attention
Right now I scoot a European, but I used to scoot a lemon
It's me man: benefactor
What's that on ya wrist? Yacht-Master



Something similar to a curtain call, my beats be clappin'
Bankroll swoll' like an allergic reaction
Suckerism's contagious like a yawn
If you play with the bull, ya gonna get the horns
Some people got time for everybody else
Except for the people that's gon' be there when it's nobody else
I could show you the newest way to play the oldest game in the world
I ain't gotta have money to pull yo' girl
When the next man is winning, don't be concerned
You can hate or you can learn
I'm the get-money whisperer, teach
Hustlers how to get money; preach
I'm from the Wild, Wild, Wild, Wild West
Where they aim for the dome and the chest
Be cool if you a tourist or a guest
Tuck yo' chain in yo' shirt, it's a mess",https://genius.com/E-40-gamed-up-lyrics
She Say She Loves Me,My Ghetto Report Card,2006.0,"She say she love me, she - she say she love me
She - she say she love me but all we do now is fuck and fight

If I asked you to rob that bank with me, wouldja do it?
Wouldja do you time like Martha Stewart?
Wouldja bust a nine, wouldja go to bat?
Put your life on the line with me, hit the dope track?
Oooh - is you down, would you beat a bootch down?
If a pimp couldn't swim, would you let a pimp drown?
Wouldja, stop naggin me about last night? (Last night)
Two wrongs don't make no right (no right)
All we do is fuck and fight
Kiss and make up and lay up all night
Now bend over while I lay this pipe
While I beat the coochie to the broad daylight
She say she love me (love me)
But when I'm in the studio, she be gettin all ugly
(Gettin all ugly... she say she love me)
But I could give a fuck 'bout it cause I'm 'bout my money
Bendin co'ners, ridin jump off
Money long, like Mutumbo
Got that tweed, pushin peas
Frankenstein, 2-2-3's
I'm about my money (money)
Hangin out the window throwin up the Playboy bunny
Ain't never phony
I'mma keep it movin mayne cause I'm always hongry
Lil' momma what that is, tell me what'cha name
What it be, do you need a lil' Q.T.?
A lil' quality time, a lil' bumpin and grind
A lil' wine and dine, a lil' movie?
A lil' money sometime, a lil' Dolce Gabann'
A cherry Louis Vuitton, a lil' jewelry?
Why you mad, why you always take it out on me? (on me)
Why you always showin out in front of company? (company)


Mannnnnnnn, ain't never seen one look like you cutie
Dammmmmmmn, five foot two with a nice round booty
You are just my type, I can see it in yo' eyes
And I knew that from day one
Stayin up all night just chillin
Talkin 'bout what we gonna name my son
Twenty-fo' seven hustlin
The object is not to be broke again
Let me get yo' whole paycheck
One time when I couldn't pay the rent
Now look at your baby Benz
With the lil' TV and the crazy rims
Big rocks on your hand
Tell your friends big daddy bought them
Now, on the other hand
Here we go again, talkin 'bout ""Where the fuck you been?""
Always, at the studio
In another time zone tryin to get rich
Get you for the Zinfandel
Fire up one, let you hit the green
Niggas mad, you on my team
Cause they know how you move them things
Come home, be a momma and a wife and a freak in the bed baby
I'm tryin to work
Why you gotta call me 100 times like you crazy?
Don't play, when the time is right
We can get up in the urr and go play
Wanna go dere, then stay hurr, and love me e'ryday


Well there's a stranger in my house, in my bed
Fuckin up my life and my bread
Playin mind games all in my head
Sometimes I swear you worse than the feds
You love a nigga, then hate a nigga
Then you love me again man this shit's confusin
In the streets hittin licks I'm winnin
Comin home fuckin with you man I'm losin (I'm losin)
I'm built for drama but not this kind (this kind)

Man you been doin too much campin (campin)
Bumpin your gums and yappin (yappin)
Interferin in grown folks business
And baby girl I just can't let that happen (happen)
I've been out here sweatin this blood
Fuckin with cutthroats to get this cake (this cake)
But I swear, it seems like the mo' I give ya
The more you try to take
My heart and my back you try to break
I ain't crazy I see the signs
Try to steal my light and my shine
You must be outta yo' fuckin mind (DAMN!)
I just wanted to spoil you
Well I guess I succeeded
But now you just too fuckin conceited
If this is love I don't need it

One of my favourite pistols is a SPringfield
Better duck before you get wet
I got diamonds and a trapezium in my delotids
When theres a problem i let my binoys drop my tinnoys
Fucking around let me rubble with a soup box bubble
Extra extra, bring back double
My life is important and it ain't ever been boring

We used to kick it at the Waterfront, the whole Vallejo
Watchin' the pervin contestses between E-40 and Del
That's what we did up under the bridge, fools posted up
Choppin' game, conversatin', gettin' toast up
Leanin' against my Zeniths, convertible tops and who's the cleanest
Them Click boys smobbin' deep in cuts, actin' meanest
The good times, they gone, here in the can is my new home
Guess in order to do some right I had to do some wrong
Picked up a package yesterday and I was HAPPY
It was a box full of goodies from my PAPPY
Tripped me out, ain't seen or heard from Potna Duke in years
Sent me a picture and some fetti, dang near sheddin' tears, huh
See, first you born then you live then you die
One day soon I'll get another try, 1-Luv

Somebody,The D-Boy Diary: Book 1,2016.0,"I knew when I came in the game it wasn't gonna be a cakewalk
I wanted the money and fame I told the Lord I'm gon' stop
Selling that candy cane 'fore I get caught by a cop
Shackles and cuffs add chains, might get set up by a narc
Got a couple of kids to raise so it's a Catch-23
Should I get a job or go back to pushin' the D?
Should I call my plug and ask him to front me a key?
Should I get my recommendation papers for trees
I got bounce-back abilities, get-back skills and ideals
Buy a food truck and start selling Meals on Wheels
Drive a tow truck so that it can help pay the bills
Create an app, get in the tech world and makes some scrill
Make a blap-rider hit record and get a deal
Get out the trap, buy me a house on top of a hill
Sharp as a tack, intelligent hoodlum, that's how I feel
Platinum plaques all on the wall for real, for real

Yeah, I'm just somebody
Tryin' to really be somebody, yeah
With everything that I do
Stop pocket watching
Hater, baller blocking, yeah
And let me do what I do
(I'm talking about getting to the money)

Deal with it, deal with it
I told 'em that one day that I'ma get it
I'm stubborn, ambitious and money driven
I drank Mangoscoto, that's what I'm sippin'
Take a swig out the bottle, I'm still ignorant
I smoke gelato like a immigrant
, incinerate
Suckas can't stop us, we motivate
I got hustle in my bones, in my body and my genetics
Wake up in the morning, do burpees and calisthenics
Hater try to hurt me, gon' need some paramedics
Might not make it through surgery, IVs and anesthetics
Fresh off the lot, not out the Autotrader
My 2017 cost a half an acre
License, insurance and registration on the dash
Case the po-po try to blast (If they blast)

Look, I'm just a man who wants it all

Smokin that broccoli now, takes me out

While I was bullshittin
Bitch tried to hit me upside the head with her shoe
Talin bout, ""Who the fuck you been doin it to?
Comin home always smellin like tuna fish and brew""
I said ""Bitch, if you don't get up outta my talkin face
I'mma slap you real tough-like
And I can almost rest assure you
That it ain't gon' be no pretty sight, ugh""

Shoot the hundred fool, let's play for pink slips, whatchu slammin?
That there shit across the street? That ugly ass gremlin?
Buy some sticky, you got the pillow
Here go some Black'n'Mild style, split it down the middle
What's that? That Oakland Crip? Nah it's that white widow
I was about to say cause they'd botha have your ass
Up in the hospital, check it out

Fuck all of that Cristal-poppin, drinkin Moet shit
I'm from the block
Wheaties, Thunderbird, gorilla milk and Aftershock
?Boom square wide country?, Wild Irish Rose
Smugglin Hennessey and scotch, Jagermeister and Tequila shots
Drinkin 40 ounces was how I first got my figure
Then I graduated to straight hard liquor
So hah, let me take a swig of that Crown Royal
What you puttin on that blunt huh? Hash oil
My Panamanian saha from south San Francisco
On some marijuana farm down in San Luis Obispo
Wake yo' ass up Charlie Hustle, wake yo' ass up, why you asleep?
Cause, nigga that shit got my twaskin?? my life nigga, shit!

Highly intosticated while I'm slidin on a brim
Set of Z's and V's, spit Long Range Pimpin
L-R-P sophisticated wannabe's, stuck up H-O-E's
Disease-infested back-polluted pussy hoochie mamas, ooh ooh
Give a damn, make that 2-8-9, think I had a V8
Highly carbureator, four-barrel engine scram
Get gas, go in sideways, figured up like a philly
Ready, get that motherfucker hop up away
Everybody got the munchies and they ain't tryin ta miss
We ride around the corner, nigga there go Emmitt Smith
Webulation! Bust a U-ey folker, oh as I'm hoppin out
Damn that's my beeper, I got dinner at the house
The rules and regulations of the game up in the Yay
Just slap a bitch silly if she gets off in my way
She's open to all the brothers, forgive me grandma yay
Three or four different bitches, five or six different times a day

I told that ho to shut up and take this dick down her throat
In kindergarten my teacher used to rinse my mouth out with soap
Cause my mouth was too foul, she didn't like the way that I spoke
After school I would hit the block and go and purchase some chalk
Triples singles and double-ups, me and all of my folks
I wore my hair like a fool, didn't give a fuck or a care
Every New Year's Eve I like to bust in the air
Ride with potato peelers, staplers and roto-tillers

It’s zany on these dumping grounds
Don’t be slippin’ with your pants down
They got some big shit hundred rounds
That’ll knock you out your shoes and spin your neck around
Crooked cops, crooked dice, crooked streets
Dark guns, dark alleys, dark reefs
Don’t get fooled by the palm trees and the beach
They wake your ass up, put the pistol to your teeth
Where the safe at? Where the shoe box? Where your duffel, patna?
Lost souls, they don’t believe in karma
The fast lane, fast cars, fast cash
Bad bitches, big titties, big ass (who out here?)

Even when it’s flying high
Watching the weather
Up above, the city skies
And gettin’ it together

Cali, the land of opportunity
San Quintin and Silicon Valley
Where they learn to play the corner
Where they play with drumsticks that’ll go through body armour
In the Pacific to be specific (what they like to do?)
Where they’ll follow you on the freeway
Catch you gettin’ off an exit when you least expect it
Unexpected, in the middle of the daylight where the traffic hectic
Bold, cold, these judges ain’t plannin’ on gettin’ old, old
Got hit now he layin’ up in the road, road
His mama outside up in her robe, robe (her robe?)

You ain't talkin' bout nothing, nigga
You ain't talkin' bout nothing, you ain't talkin' bout shit

Uh
They ain't talkin' bout shit, they talking bullshit
Put the rifle to your lip, longer than a pool stick
Walk down to my target, empty out the cartridge
Talking all that nonsense, turned his body to a carcass
My lil niggas heartless, they push the line the hardest
Open a sucker up, like a can of StarKist
Niggas don't give a fuck and they are not my artist
Line a nigga up, but they are not my barbers
The black man, I want to see the black man having chicken
The woman is influenced by the gram, so she stripping
The other man be running it up, big money he be tripping
My left hand be arguing with my right hand when I'm whipping
Choppers under the cabinets, kitchen drawers and coaches
In the broken down public houses, where nerds get no passes
Got a glue trap for the mouses and a shovel for you snakes
What I say behind your back, I say it to your face

You ain't talkin' bout nothing, nig
You ain't talkin' bout nothing, you ain't talkin' bout nothing, nig

Yeah look
Shh, be quiet, niggas stop talking so much start sliding
I'm deaf to the bullshit, bullshit, niggas talking bullshit
Cali niggas with an FNN and a full clip
Rich crip, rich gangbanger, still in the hood one million dollars later
Still in the hood after all the times they raided
Fucked around and ended up number one of my generation
Woke up to a view of the city, 655, 50 bitch come ride with me
I got choices, can't hear you niggas voices
Can't stop a ghetto nigga that's focused, bitch I'm explosive
Nigga I'm the shit, bitch I'm the nigga you've been tryna fuck with
Ain't got time for niggas running they mouth

Watcha know about me, real stump down P
Two fingers, still who bangin'
Blue line station, shoot my patient friends
Fuck the enemy, tell 'em come and get at me
Brown bandana, dub chipping with the shits
Count my stack, then I flip it then I flee
Bad bitch choosing up, hoe you know the fee
Everybody wanna be somebody 'til they rich
Niggas wanna trip, yeah pull up with the stick
Pull up with the stick, pull up, pull up with the stick
Slipping out the limp, now he shooting out the hip
You ain't walking round busting, you ain't talkin' bout nothing

Things’ll Never Change,Tha Hall of Game,1996.0,"Ah yeah..(ah yeah)..it's real
Gonna put it down. all these little crime thangs
Homeless, the world is crazy bwoy
It's like this
It's the way it is
Heavy out there.. it's heavy

Was I really such a bad child
That I deserved to get hit with boards
And whooped with extension cords?
Did you forget that I was your creation
And all I wanted from you all was love, hope, and motivation?
Son, you're disrespectful and you're talking back
Get out my face, kicked me out the house
And wouldn't even let me plead my case
Now I'm homeless and I'm freezing like the morgue
The only thing keeping me alive is the Lord
Needless to say it's times like this I'd rather be locked up than
Drinking water out my hands and eating out of garbage cans
Can I come back home, huh, could I?
Son, you're on your own, why should I?

Things'll never change, that's just the way it is
Nobody's even concerned
Some things'll never change, that's just the way it is
When will we ever learn?

Huh. three years from now, I think I'm gon' be straight (Straight)
I put my name on the list for Section 8
Tried out for the Army, but I was flat footed
Didn't do no harm to me, 'cause I was used to it
If I apply for some work, let's make a bet
I'll get denied 'cause I don't know about the Internet
What do you think we need to do to change about this nation?
Need to provide more jobs and better education
Nuclear weapons (puh, puh) should be stopping crimes
Already got enough to blow the world up a thousand times
The birds and the bees, deadly disease
Teenage pregnancies, STD's

Things'll never change, that's just the way it is
Nobody's even concerned
Some things'll never change, that's just the way it is
When will we ever learn?
Things'll never change, that's just the way it is
Nobody's even concerned
Some things'll never change, that's just the way it is
When will we ever learn?

A-wuh-uh, wait a minute, I hear sirens
Oh, that's the couple down the street, domestic violence
Either them or the little girl in 306
She's always telling everyone that she gon' slice her wrists
I guess that's the way it is in the life of sin
Where you'll probably end up dead, or in the pen
But my family ain't no better than the next
My auntie Brenda turned her own sister in for writing bad checks
And saved folks will try to hit you where it hurts
Knowing they the biggest hypocrites in the church
We need to give our minds a bath and do some scrubbin'
Stop the hate and start the lovin'

Things'll never change, that's just the way it is
Nobody's even concerned
Some things'll never change, that's just the way it is
When will we ever learn?",https://genius.com/E-40-thingsll-never-change-lyrics
Three Jobs,Sharp On All 4 Corners: Corner 1,2014.0,"UH! ?Lord? Plaza, Payless Shoes, got my shoes for cheap
When my parents separated, I cried for weeks
Had a passion for music, beating on my desk
4th grade, Elsa Widenmann, Country Club Crest
Signed up for the band, mama wasn't mad
Took me to ?Minor's? Music to buy a drum pad (What else?)
And a pair of wooden sticks with the plastic tips
So I could practice my craft and one day get rich
(What you do?)
Kept it going, started rapping in the 7th grade (What you hear?)
Heard ""Rapper's Delight"": Sugarhill Gang
Growing up, life wasn't always fair
Moved to Magazine street, nothing like Bel-Air
A lot of shootouts and fights, hustling to survive
I pray every day, I thank God I'm still alive
A lot of my people ain't here no more
They either dead or in jail, on dog food or either blow

I had a paper route
Free lunch, that was me, dawg
Getting teased made me hard
Living in the struggle
All I know is a hustle
And my mama had three jobs
I had a paper route
Free lunch, that was me, dawg
Getting teased made me hard
Living in the struggle
All I know is a hustle
And my mama had three jobs
Three jobs

I went from chopped Ramen noodles to garlic noodles at Crustacean
A little snotty nose ghetto child, see people grandma freebasing
(What else you see?)
Done seen it all, it ain't too much could trip me out
Only time when I cry is when the choir singing the missionary shout
Some of my loved ones in the bing, they locked up
They got a cell phone, they mannish, be on Twitter and Facebook
I send them the latest albums that slap
The music by mail, access secure pack—How about that?
Real ones be real ones, my nigga
If you a real one, my nigga, let's get these millions, my nigga
I'm with you if you off or on
Love keeps no record of wrong
To all my people in the struggle going through it
Listen to 40 lyrics, his music therapeutic
It's sick out here
Rifles big enough to kill a deer

I had a paper route
Free lunch, that was me, dawg
Getting teased made me hard
Living in the struggle
All I know is a hustle
And my mama had three jobs
I had a paper route
Free lunch, that was me, dawg
Getting teased made me hard
Living in the struggle
All I know is a hustle
And my mama had three jobs
Three jobs

Blowing medicinal is traditional around these parts
Only thing square about me is my candy Chevy box
Tremendous knock, or should I say slap, slumpin' 'em
Sound like The Thing and The Hulk in the trunk fading, back there chunkin' 'em
Intersection shootouts, bullets flying
I'm from an underserved community, bad credit and crime
So many babies dying, stuck in the middle, caught in the chaos
Everybody got guns, anybody will knock you off
When it rains it pours, lightning and thunder
I'm cool with the creator, I got his cell phone number
(When you talk to him?) I talk to him all the time
When the saints go marching in, I want to be in that line
Lack of communication leads to blood spilling
Mama always taught me never tease and laugh at special needs children
She worked at Napa State Hospital mental institution, Maggie's Hamburgers and Mr Jimmy's grocery store
Three jobs

I had a paper route
Free lunch, that was me, dawg
Getting teased made me hard
Living in the struggle
All I know is a hustle
And my mama had three jobs
I had a paper route
Free lunch, that was me, dawg
Getting teased made me hard
Living in the struggle

I ain't got no time for no silly games
I'm out here in this trap trying have my change
I fuck with real bosses, I don't fuck with lames
Califor-n-i-a is the state I claim
Bitches on my ankle like a ankle bracelet
Cuz I'm relevant and I ain't outdated
Suckers looking at me like they wanna fade it
They fuck around they gona get emlimated
Bossy, flossy, fetti stretchy like Pilates
Got a black belt hustlin, not karate
The best thing sense the slot machine
She a dime spitter, a couple of lines and that bitch is mine's
Now I don't know what you been thinking
But I've been the shit in my region
Ever sense I can remember
Ever sense I been breathing
Hollerin at a vixen, plottin on some kitten
When I start spittin, she starts strippin


I', passionate about my paper man
I ain't got time for games
The child shit ain't in my program man
I leave that to you all lanes
I'm bossy, once I get started its hard to stop me man I go
Lieutenant rosta boss I ain't ""Captain Save a Hoe""
I let a bitch know I got cho-ho, bitch I'm po'
You gotta dig me for me, that's the way it's gonna go
I be galaxy man, I be spacin
When I'm spacin I mean my space and gettin the flash on a ho-ass nigga tryin test my patience
Colt 45 casing, and I ain't talkin about the beer
I'm talkin street instruments, music to my ears
I ain't a pretty nigga with a face tat and a six pack
But I bet you I could beat your bitch's coochie back
Skinny niggas winning right now
But wait til big nigga come back in style
Bitch


You call it swag, I call it stylin
You nut in a minute, I nut in an hour
I could be broker then you, but I got more respect and more power
Right now I sell CD's, but I used to slang powder
I ain't gotta have no paper to get me skin
I just give had her my phone and she punch her number in
Mack game, big boss talk
I don't make it rain and I don't pay for yoak
You see the big face Rolex watch, the VS1 clarity watch
The jacket made out of fox, you know how much that cost?
The three dimensional medallion, more carets than Bugs Bunny
Taylor made and hand crafted, customized by King Johnny
Sometimes I like to spoil myself
All'a that hatin ain't nutritious, it's bad for your health
What about murder mouthin, talk down on a boss
Through that nigga a towel, he been dipped in sucker sauce

My .45 pistol chrome bust a nigga shit, bust a dome
Yo' bread is midget and dwarf, like a Hobbit
My yaper is long and lanky like Peja Stojaković
Tall like the mileage on my 70 Cutlass-es
Gas break and dip and then scrapin it with my loved ones


I'm out the sunroof, gone off that rotgut
Straight scrape, that's the sound when the shocks touch
White walls whistlin pipes, Harley D stickers
Candy paint straight coonin, look at me nigga
Get my scratch, all about my mail - uhh
Ant, Stress, and Doonie, them boys from the fields
Gas, break, dip, scrape
Smoke it, up, figure eight
How I scrape? Goldie's a eight
Pull up, dig in my nose, and give you handshake
40-Agua, lent me the Range (love some bam shit)
Cross my fingers put it on citas I won't crash it
But my drink's spiked, so I just might
Dent a bumper or two, and bust a headlight
Now, all my niggas in they scrapers (DO'S OPEN)
Bucket or Benz (get that Vogue meat smokin!)


Okayyyy, okayyyy
'96 Cutlass, mayonnaise and mustard
Dusted and disgusted but my guts like custard
Green caramel, Too $hort, ""Freaky Tales""
Bumpin in the zoney, pimpin tenderonis
Blueberry blunt wrapped with a Rick Rock slap
Like Busta Rhymes, make they gun booty cheek clap
Stop by the trap, shoot a few craps
Don't trust na'r a nigga, keep the strap on my lap
Cell phone might be tapped, so we speak in all slang
That's why the white folk think that we all strange
People in the back of me see the TV's
Ant scrapin tough like a pair of Dungarees
Coonin E-Feez, on Myrtle Beach
Carlos Rossi, where the turtle growin trees
My na'r na'an nutta make all the hoes stutter
Gas break dip bend the pussy then cut her


Punch the gas then break (then break)
Then dip (then dip) then scrape (scrape scrape)

Gas, break, gas, break

(static) This was an official, Sic'Wid It, Federation slap
You may now, close your scraper doors, and go home
Thank you",https://genius.com/E-40-gas-break-dip-lyrics

Got a valid registration and my cannabis card
I'm challenged, got candy paint on my Harley
Bike and truck, jet ski's boats and old school Cut'
Looking for a top shelf, not no more
That candy paint, got 'em gone, can't believe their eyes
Drank and dank, flabbergasted mesmerize
Digital dash, having my cash

Tossin' deuces out the roof, but that coupe
While I ride by, players chunking deuces back
Bopp's holl'ing out 
""hi!""
Feel like I'm up in the sky, gone on that bay green
40 got them going  when we pull up on the scene
Candy paint, looking clean, fo's looking king size
Heads turn while I drive by, it's like they can't believe their eyes
""Is that that boy Thugga and that bad motherfucka?""

Like a countdown, 3-2-1 I'm gone, 3-2-1 I'm gone

3-2-1, I'm gone (Outta here!)

They try to foreclose my home (Take it!)
Now I'm gettin' my bank all long (I'm back!)
Take baby steps, stay safe (Longevity!)
Legends ain't built in a day (Work!)
Quarter platinum plaques in the hallway (Money!)
Not Frank Sinatra but I did it my way

Cut the top off the coupe, that's surgery (Serious!)
Must be blind deaf dumb if you ain't heard of me

I got jewelry like a Pharaoh, I still get it for the L-O
And it's hard for me to let go and it's hard for me to drive
Gettin head and gettin high, man, I make that pussy echo
Known for hit and runs, so I hope you got that gecko
Put it in yo muthafuckin face like a freckle


Slid in the function by my lonesome (Lonesome!)
Left out the function wit yo woman (Woman!)
Pockets deeper than the Red Sea (Peep! See!)
Quarter million worth of jewelry (Jeweller!)
Banked up, hella scrill, when I take a shower
Fuck a towel, bitch, I use a hundred dollar bill!
I'm feeling how I'm posed to feel, off the sauce, I'm a boss (Boss!)
Tryna fuck on every bad bitch I come across (Cross!)
Loyal to my soil, purple bag Crown Royal (Liquor!)
L.A. Confidential sprinkled with the hash oil (Wax!)
(What is you?) Money motivated
(Where you be?) In the streets like bullet-shell casings (Bow!)
I'm crack, nasal candy on the microphone (Dope!)
So much gas I need to own a Chev-a-ron

Wake They Shit Up,Practice Makes Paper,2019.0,"Act like you forgot about it, let some months go by

Act like you forgot about it, let some months go by

And just when niggas think you let that shit go
Slide through and wake they shit up

They homie gone, got his name still they contacts
His mama on dope again and she relapsed
Them and they potnas put R.I.P. in they bio
Vow to revenge death on the Bible
It's bad and it's ugly, it's on on sight
The streets be talkin' and watchin'
What's in the dark gon' come to light
The perpetrators think they cowards and they squibble
What they fail to realize is they got some change on their hair
The youth activists try to do what they can and extend their hand
With non-profit organizations and guns buy back programs
It's only so much they can do, they used to be like them
Back and forth to juvie, in and out the pen
The system's corrupted, want us to suffer
Designed for Black and Latinos, people of color
Karma used to take three years but it now it take 30 seconds
And it's a blessing to be living, ain't no question

Yeah, I kick back about 90 days
I ain't trippin' off niggas, man, I'm out the way
Got a bunch of dirty work out in San Jose
WhatsApp if you ever tryna run the play
Heard numbers goin' up, we ain't givin' in
Never fold, I was told that ain't how you win
Strategize, map it out 'fore you blap it out
Couple hundred on the floor, we'll pack it out
When I move through the city I be on the dolo
Most likely with a bag, I don't do the po-po
Hellcat with a stick 'cause you never know though
Got my own damn back with the forty four-four
If you really into game then you really know this
When shit be goin' good that's when niggas get hit
It could be your own hood, set you up with a bitch
Sniper on the roof and he fully equipped with clips

Act like you forgot about it, let some months go by
Let everything just simmer down
And just when them niggas think you let that shit go

It take a fool to catch a fool, that's what they say
But nowadays, anybody can get the AK
AR-15, create a crime scene
All it take is some gouda to formulate a team
Some of these fools is bad news
Some of these fools get down but some don't think about they dudes
They loved ones, they cousins, they next of kin
They mommies, they daddies, they baby mamas and they kids (Ooh)
Get caught in the crossfire
Funkin' over these bitches, these bitches be liars
Don't be tellin' her all your business, you could get flat like a tire
She scandalous and she vicious, get you sent to the Kaiser
She fuckin' him, she fuckin' him, she fuckin' him
At the same time, she robbin' him

Listen up

A breath of fresh air
That’s right man a breath of fresh air man just to break the monotony
A breath of fresh air
Kick on back play some dominoes, some cards or somethin man you feel me
A breath of fresh air
Slide out with ya family in the traffic man on one of them long ass trips man
A breath of fresh air
Yea live life to the fullest my dude (live life)

Living life to the fullest enjoying every moment
Every second every breath till my death
Wondering if i’ll get anytime to repent before he lay me to rest
It’s that hard i’m slippin to put some hair on ya chest
Sippin it with my family as we laugh and reminisce
I ain't above you i anit below you i’m right beside you
I love you that’s on the bible
Slapping bones and plan fo push up on some chedda
Yelling out 3’s switching bitches still ella and della
The umbrella sick with it baby one of a kind
Ain't no nigga on the block selling rock like mine
Every rhyme on time i bring the real ones out
45s fo the ones that poke em dead in the mouth

Pushin house with the pinky nigga what we going do
I’m everywhere baby i be full of me
Feels good, when it’s good around the family tree

A breath of fresh air I got fans that love this shit

I don’t just listen to rap I’m a music lover
I bump earth wind and fire and the Isley brothers
Convulsion to slide in the family stone
From valen california that’s my home
I’m from a underserved community where you can’t be no chump
History repeats itself but opportunities don’t
Hotta stick to script and play by the book
Ghen the mouth stumble it’s worst than the foot
My aunty from the country she be fryin rappers
I’ll tell her bout them courts and my bad habits
She be gettin to the money straight try’na grab it
I tell her give it to the lord we goin all have it
At church on wednesday, choir practice Grandmama, granddaddy yea they been that
Lead by example sword tracked, your baseline got me doing back flips

A breath of fresh air
You know heavy bass line and good funk man you know
A breath of fresh air
Yakin it way back man you know we goin
Bring this all way back to some throw back song
A breath of fresh air
Bringin it to the fore front of the new school
Ya feel me they need to hear this man
A breath of fresh air
You know 40 goin feed y’all man amma come with all that shit man I’m the best

When I was growin' up, we went from the shoulders and knuckled up
We had to square up and squabble, swing ’em and chunk ’em
And even if you got your ass beat, at least you stood for somethin'
I don’t condone sucka shit, that's not how the game was designed
I don't tape conversations, I don't record FaceTime
I’m the last of my make so therefore it won't be no more
It's stormin' suckas, it's thunderin', when it rains, it pours
""40 Water, what it do? You still dribble?"" Nope
""Oh, I was gon' say, if you do, you got a pickle?""
A pickle, a pea, a pound?
Let me call one of my folks, they still get down
Life is a gamble but this ain't Caesar's
This a Hail Mary, a jumpball, a buzzer beater

Ain't been home in a month, ain't been sleep in a week
I'm in love with the road, I'm addicted to cheese
Jumped off the Porsche, landed straight in the streets
I play the hand that was given to me
Bitch, I was made this way, I was made this way
And we were made this way, I was made this way, ayy

I might mix Amiri with some Alexander Wang drip
Tryna see how many hoes can the plane fit
How the fuck you drivin' that on Earth? That's a spaceship
Domestic violence on my neck, that's how the chain hit, bitch
Under pressure, I'ma shoot the three like Jordan in his prime (Boom)
Ruler of this Glock, nigga, measure up your eyes
Diamonds in the Rollie face like, 'Nigga, fuck the time' (Fuck it)
Blow your brains out then we gon' see what's on your mind
Nigga hatin' on me, take his bitch on a vacation
When your crib get lit up, them ain't no Christmas decorations
Wake up, pick my clothes, I'll jump in the shower
Then go kick it with my unc' who used to sell powder
You joined a gang but don't nothin' about it (You don't know shit)
That's how we know you only did it for survival (You scary)
You better pray that you ain't clique up with the rivals
'Cause every night we huntin' with extensions on them rifles
Big Glock on my hip look like a blow dryer (Big glizzy)
Smoke a Backwood, take my soul higher
These rappers ain't even talented, they got ghostwriters
Set your head on fire, turn you to Ghost Rider

Ain't been home in a month, ain't been sleep in a week
I'm in love with the road, I'm addicted to cheese
Jumped off the Porsche, landed straight in the streets
I play the hand that was given to me

Help Me,The Block Brochure: Welcome to the Soil 1,2012.0,"Lord, help me
Lord, help me

When I was a little young ghetto child, I wanted to be comic
Dollars stack, maybe one day on the sonic
Soaking up game from the OG's drinking gin and tonic
See this street right here, this shit haunted
Lost soul, evil spirits live, the walking dead
Grudge holder shot at him but killer her instead
Every time we leave the house, we take a chance
Dresser drawer full of obituary programs
Never make fun of the mentally challenged, that ain't the biz
And I was taught to never laugh at disadvantaged kids
Where my real ones at? We the last Mohicans
A lot of OGs fell off, thank God I’m still breathing
My purpose on this earth, your guess is good as mine
When they put me in the dirt, Heaven I hope I find
Sit with God and John the Baptist, sip some Jesus wine
Every time I write my rhymes, my pen starts to cry
She wanna go to the club and kick it with her homies
But her fetti funny, she can’t spend her laundry money
Plus her water bill's sky high, need a plumber, can’t afford to gamble
The commode keep running, gotta shake the toilet handle
In the ghetto, we got all kinds of home remedies and things
If we catch a cold, we drink the juice from collard greens
Got a ear ache? Don’t stress, don’t foil
Reach in the cabinets and grab some sweet oil

I’m out here in the cold (In the cold)
Feels like nobody knows but can’t they see me?
Lord, I need some help (I need some help, Lord)
I pray today’s the day (Today's the day)
That one of your angels finally looks down and sees me
(Look down on me)
'Cause I need some help (I need some help, spit it, Meezy)
I’m out here in the cold (In the cold)
Every day feels like I'm all alone (All alone)
Lord, can't you see me, ay, 'cause I need some help
(I need some help, Lord)
I pray today’s the day that one of your angels finally
Looks down and sees me (Look down and see me)
'Cause I need some help (I need some help, spit it Go Hard)

I got undying niggas and undying hoes turn into foes
I've been setting too many traps to drop dollars
Deal with it and go hard Black on the map to sell out for scraps
Three things that you don’t need to fuck with:
That’s my family, my bread, and my rap
Do people with deep scars ever get rewards?
Why is it that the most real never seem to get their card?
Is my music about all this winning and losing don’t ever get heard?
Or am I just wasting more time painting pictures with words?
There’s a lot a people that know who love me
Wasn’t even halftime when they game got boring
Why do I keep hearing it’s the first thing they hate you
They ain't as strong as you, and they not gettin' blessed like you do
People quick to forget what made love
It’s got so easy for people to betray love
And even though I haven’t found it, I still have a positive mind frame
It’s why I always give the winos at least four biscuits 'cause I know that I’ve been through some shit
It seems like I done lost another friend every time my potnas come back home from the pen
Or has the pen just become home for them?
It’s too many parts to pain
(It’s too many parts to pain, mayne, I hear you, Go Hard Black)

I’m out here in the cold (In the cold)
Feels like nobody knows but can’t they see me?
Lord, I need some help (I need some help, Lord)
I pray today’s the day (Today's the day)
That one of your angels finally looks down and sees me
(Look down on me)
'Cause I need some help (I need some help)
I’m out here in the cold (In the cold)
Every day feels like I'm all alone (All alone)
Lord, can't you see me, ay, 'cause I need some help
(I need some help, Lord)
I pray today’s the day that one of your angels finally
Looks down and sees me (Look down and see me)
'Cause I need some help (I need some help)

Pervin like a mothafucka swervin
Hope I don't scrub in my '95 Suburban
To go throughout the community squattin on gold tippy toes
Peep, breathin on Indian cigarette-Ganish Bidi posin niggas tweak
Quick fast in a hurry, don't worry, 40 vision ain't blurry
Shorty hit the freeways right up the ways, clownin like that nigga Joe Torry

Well, what do you know, it's siggity Cel

Kickin in doors, you better grab ya ho

I tell a bitch what the fuck you mean where I've been
And so what I smells like pussy and gin
I had money to make
Bitches to break
And if the shit was out of line I had lives to take
I told you from the gate that I'm a mobster
Sippin DP, eatin lobster
Don't get it confused, you won't get abused
As long as you makin' me them revenues

That miggity mack, that diggity dang and that niggity nut
Jump in the back of my cut with a tramp slut and hit the guts

Pass 'em to the extra mannish nigga, 40 water, sic 'em

If I was Popeye I woulda told Bluto
'You could kiss my big black royal'
I'm not funkin' over Olive Oyl
Last night I had a superbad in my room
She sucked me 'til my dick shriveled up like a prune
Well pass the hussy to the left hand side
So I can bend her over, hit it from the back, and let her ride
You know a Sick Wid It hog gotta put the shake down
Shoot her to the left, nigga, hit me with that breakdown

They doubted me, outed me, didn't want me to flourish
I come from the ghetto where we was famished, malnourished
When people first heard me, they thought that I was a fluke
But I'm a real nigga like Kunta Kinte from Roots
I'ma keep runnin' even without any shoes
Got family in Louisiana, out there in the boot
My niggas be huntin' and they'll give you the blues
They don't do music but they some Pros with the Tools

Used to keep the bacon fat up in a can of Folger's

Put your finger on the trunk, feel the pulse
I never leave the teepee without the toast
You see the liquid on my chain, I flamboast
When I'm higher than Pluto, I eat menudo
Pozole elote, might think I'm an esé
I sleep with my cuete, I'll leave your ass muerte
Vallejo, Cali-harm-ya, 7-O-siete
The Good Book is my buckler and shield
Death could come outta nowhere, like when the rock hit your windshield
That's why I always keep a rototiller
When I'm out there in the field in the traffic making deals
Every stack I get, like Kaepernick, I kneel
Ain't talking about no dinner but I need a meal
Release my niggas down waiting for appeal
In a gladiator tank, sharks and eels...BIATCH!

And these days, gotta watch who you trust
Keep that pistol by my side, in this block I trust
I came from nothin' so I had to run it up
They just wanna see me fail, they don't wanna see me up
And I know the Lord chose me
To have the vision in what most don't see
I got money, started hating on me
Niggas that I used to love tryna stonewall me
And I know money bring hate but I'ma keep getting this cake

And niggas wanna see me fall, so on my momma, I'ma ball
I know niggas wanna see me fall, so on my momma, I'ma ball, ball

Off top Tommy, rollin' up a mummy
Thumbin' through his money, thumper by his tummy
Blowin' on a branch, higher than an avalanche
Hazy like a forest fire in a Napa Valley ranch
Cash flow Cliff, sippin' on a fifth
Spill more liquor on his shirt, got a hole in his lip
Sitting on some cheddar and them niggas know better
Semi-auto wetter fly your head like a feather
Honey coochie slap, smell like a Life Saver
Baby booty stacked like a Sunday newspaper
Bitch, I'm a mack, not a caped crusader
Captain-Save-a-Batch? Nope, I check yaper
Money on my mind, money on my mind
If I do the crime, I'ma do the time
Never drop a dime, never drop a dime
Hold water on my chest, high alkaline

Nigga drippin' and splashin', coulda bought it, we won't mind jackin'
Man, these niggas be actin' so I ride with a clip that's massive
Trippin', I'm active, wave the stick like we doin' magic, ay, nigga

Niggas finessing choppers, Glockies, niggas, come get one
Bitches undressin', what you doin'? I just need income
Big-ass pole like I'm Cardi B, watch me strip some
Fuck all that talkin', come back where you got your bitch from
Don't play fair, big 40 came with a big drum
Dunkin', I'm air, watch your language, these bullets hit tons
Thumbin' through hundreds, now I'm trippin' 'cause this bitch skip one
If I go down, keep it a hundred like I'm Big Pun (Ayy)
Wave the stick like I'm doin' magic, I be slidin' with ratchets
All in traffic let 'em have it then swing it like nothin' happened
Gang-gang brought the choppers, if he trippin', knock off a fraction
I can't love 'em, just fuck 'em, get the scissors, cut off distractions
You just rappin', stop the cappin', I'm really past the infraction
Keep it ratchet but pull up with a bitch, fulfill my passion
I can't have it, keep the love and I really don't want compassion
Bitch, I came up off the juugin', plottin', hittin' the mansions, lil' nigga

Have no choice but to be a savage, thirty poke out the fabric, uh
Drippin' and splashin', coulda bought it, we won't mind jackin', uh
Niggas be actin' so I ride with a clip that's massive
I be trippin', I'm active, wave the stick like we doin' magic
Have no choice but to be a savage, thirty poke out the fabric

Man, these niggas be actin' so I ride with a clip that's massive
Trippin', I'm active, wave the stick like we doin' magic, ay, nigga

I'm a goon with the spoon, I'll chip you off somethin' proper
Got kicks like I'm into soccer, I'll throw that thang in the water
And add the soda, mix it up 'til it's harder
The price is right like Bob Barker, they in a line like The Carter
I got 'em fiendin' and tweakin', my hoodlums and heathens
223 reasons to leave you leakin', choose one
I got a gun that'll knock a nose off a elephant, I'm relevant
Fuck celibate, I'll sell a bitch if I have to, if I must
I don't put my trust in no ho, bitch, my mama all I trust
She ain't gon' snitch, I promise you, she ain't gon' throw me under the bus
She ain't gon' miss and I'm promisin' you, my nigga, she a bust
She'll do a bid for me before she see me in some cuffs
All my life I had it rough, I ain't never been powder puff
Never been a weenie, I'll disappear you genie
With a 14-Mini-Henny, untraceable, no identity
Better hope that you're kin to me, don't want me to be your enemy, biatch!

Have no choice but to be a savage, thirty poke out the fabric, uh
Drippin' and splashin', coulda bought it, we won't mind jackin', uh
Niggas be actin' so I ride with a clip that's massive
I be trippin', I'm active, wave the stick like we doin' magic

Close encounter, digital scale and money counter
On top of the kitchen counter, right up under the cabinets by the rice and flour
Packin' power, even in the shower I got my thirty-rounder
Thirty-shot extended'll give a hater dementia
Never know who wanna end ya, could be someone ya kin to
The homie or just a random, whoever it is, I handle 'em
When I first cut my teeth in the streets I fell deep in love
With the glitter and glamour, bit by the hustlin' bug
I doubled my profit off a quarter zip of the yola
Right then and there I wanted to be a high roller
I was consistent about my chicken when I was out there deliverin'
That nasal candy and turtle, that nostril dust and that herbal
Quarterbackin' and flea-flickin', handin' off packs to my team
My colleagues, my squad and my co-defendants move beans
I promised myself to be that dude no matter what line of work that I choose
Stay fitted and knitted, people judge a pimp by his shoes (Biatch!)

Start off with nose candy, I ain't never sold candy (Never)
When I say the boy is mines, I ain't talkin' Brandy (Nah)
I'm talkin' heron, I probably served your granddaddy (Yah)
Bowls and Glad baggies stashin' Os in old Caddies
Narcs search us 'cause we wearin' Cartis and our clothes baggy (C'mere)
I had a operation back when you was masturbatin'
I was broke, but havin' patience, now I shop with no debatin'
I was raised around triple beams and triple-gold Daytons
All the shit that wasn't cool then is shit these niggas praisin' (Yah)
True to the game, I ain't never broke the rules
Never robbed my plug, never betrayed the crew

So all I know is gettin' commas, hell, I guess I got a linage
Made a play right off of counters, get the bag off in an hour
God, kill me if I'm lyin', sold it 'fore it's done dryin', nigga

Twist the cap up off my weed jar, and smoked a cone
Took a shower and got gone in the wind, like Steve Wynn
I'm from the streets of California where we be hustlin and grittin'
Gettin' that women, mobbin' and mackin', droppin' and stackin'
Wheelin' and dealin' and makin' a killin' trying to hit a million
Perkin' and illin' and drinkin' and chillin' in front of the apartment building
Packin' and totin' and toast the lean oh what a feelin'
He's a fraudulent, I'm immaculate
He a simp, he a sap, he irrelevant
I'm a boss, I'm a factor, I'm a hundred percent
I'm a hustler like Larry Flynt
Getting money's my habit, I stay in the traffic
Papered up like a tablet, my bankroll is massive
If I walked in a loser, mayne I'm gonna walk out a winner
I ball like a hooper man, papered up like a printer
I ain't wrapped too tight, I'm touched, I'm throwed
Mental health, argue with my conscience cursin' out myself
My psychologist got a psychologist, neurologist too
I'm one of one, I'm not like you

Act like you know
Dippin' and bobbin' and weavin'
In and out of traffic, from the morning to the evening

Stack it to the ceiling

Drinking and blowing on some good bud
Smokin' on a strain you never heard of
Exclusive shit, I got it from my plugs
You drop my weed on my rug
That's twenty pushups, that's a party foul
You can do 'em later or do 'em now
I don't allow (who?)
Aliens around me, that's a no-no
They'll try to sneak me and turn my brains into adobo
Rarely see me solo, if you do I'm not
Best believe E-40 with his .45 Glock
I'm ADHD, need something to calm my nerves
You libel to find me at my kid's teacher's meeting smellin' like herb
I stay plastered, but I'm all about my paper
Liquor aroma, that's me in the elevator
More whips than Auto Trader, that's what I got
Driveway, looks like a car lot
My bite is stronger than my bark
Thought you thought, heart
Bitch you full of shit like a dog park
Mark ass poodle, square as a cubicle
Weirdo, unusual
Why do suckas, be all in a real one's business?
While these sideline niggas be always trying to count a hustler's chizznips
Flappin' their lizznips like some bitches, man they saps
Dudes be running their mouth like that, we call 'em quack-quacks
That's how a bitch gets smack-smacked
Shot in the naps, clapped
Head put on flap, Fix-a-Flat can't even bring 'em back (bitch)

Put that drip around my neck like a flea collar
All I know is gouda and I stay with protection
In case a sucka muthafucka get to flexin’
If them fools get in my business and they askin' me questions
I ain't about to do no tellin’ or confessin'
My grind is aggressive, it ain't no draggin' my feet
It ain't no pumpin' my brakes, mayne, my family gotta eat

I know it's sick out here and they’ll call your bluff

In California they don’t play fair
They'll do a walk-by in front of a daycare
They’ll use a little baby as a human shield
When it comes to gettin' they mans they don't care who get killed, ooh

The streets is cold at night and full of zombies (Full of zombies)
Runnin' from police, they was gettin’ on me (Gettin' on me)
Gotta watch my back, gotta watch the homies

Gotta watch the homies (Gotta watch the homies)
Watch 'em, biatch!

You wanna wallow with the hogs or fly with the eagles?
Slow it down and ride wit' ya people (Ride wit' ya people)
He who moves fast is destined to fall victim
To niggas who was plottin' to catch him slippin'
Listen, it's a whole lotta wisdom being given for free
By OG's that done lived this
Hear this? The whole hood full of zombies
Walkin' around this bitch tryna take something from me

As I sit back and reminisce on how it done me (Uh)
One minute it's all good wit' ya potna (Wit' ya potna)
The next minute we tryna figure out who shot ya (Who shot ya?)
Been the homeboy since day one wit' it
Used ride him in the Maybach tinted
And that's different, wonder what happened
This nigga played you, I woulda zapped him

It's a different ballgame I'll have you know
Nowadays they don't care how many niggas you killed 20 years ago
They'll body the body man for some dough
Toe-tag the body man that bodied the body man's toe
Surgical gloves, no fingerprints, no evidence
Hyenas and baby cubs staking out your residence
Ready to get 'em somethin' and turn 'em into skeletons
Did they homework, got intel and intelligence
It's murkish, it's spooky like a Steven Spielberg movie
No unity in the community, just funerals, wakes, and eulogies
Everybody sick, it's going around
And blind people ain't the only one with a stick, it's goin' down
Catastrophic conditions, disaster and destruction
Makin' the wrong decisions and not reading the instructions'll
Get you caught in a Catch 23, not Catch 22

Nigga, give me six (Six, six, six)
Give me six feet and an ounce of space
Give me six feet and an ounce of space (Nigga, give me six)
Give me six feet and an ounce of space
Give me six feet and an ounce of space

Ain't nothin' between us but space and opportunity
No time for childish shit and buffoonery
I sneeze around peons, achee
I don't want no clowns hanging 'round me
Gotta peep the borderline haters on the cuffs
It's hard trust the people that you trust
The closest one to you that always borrow
They'll line you up tomorrow for some marbles
I can look a human in the eye like a stock
And tell right away that he a no good guy
His energy and his aura ain't connected
He jealous, his pockets is anorexic
When I was twenty-one, my dreams was twenty-to-one
I accepted my failures and didn't blame anyone
Sign hella cousins to your label and they rap
Chances are a couple gon' stab your ass in the back

Nigga, give me six (Six, six, six)
Nigga, give me six (Six, six, six)
Nigga, give me six (Six, six, six)
Give me six feet and an ounce of space
Give me six feet and an ounce of space (Nigga, give me six)
Give me six feet and an ounce of space
Give me six feet and an ounce of space

Bad bidness, I don't practice
I'm ganged up and sharp like a cactus
I'm all over it like flour on raw chicken
I don't do bogus shit, ain't no reneggin'
Gettin' after it, I done mastered and perfected the art of gassin'
Thirty-two years of heat, not once did I fall asleep
If there's yayper bein' made, then I want in
We can't be friends if 40 ain't your top ten
Don't ever mention my name in the same sentence as sucka shit
The Bay is what I claim and I never been a puppet
I been networkin', in virtual meetings all day
When I slap gospel music, I play the homie Lecrae
I'm a veteran but I'm current and I'm on
Every word that I say can be a song
Uh, rap like I'm poor
West Coast best, Mount Rushmore

Nigga, give me six (Six, six, six)
Nigga, give me six (Six, six, six)
Nigga, give me six (Six, six, six)

It’s All Bad,In a Major Way,1995.0,"(E-40 and 
Droop-E
 talking)
Daddy
What's up?
What you doin'?
Sittin' up here marinatin', just, you know, trippin' off how this life is, man. Life is a trip
Well, what you writin'?
Just, you know, some ol' crazy, you know, some sh...my feelin's, you know?
Let me hear it

Why was I born in these trifling ass times?
Why is it mandatory that I carry knives?
Don't be too liberal 'cause, see, white folks get jacked too
Doctors, high-class lawyers and even Japs too
You ask me why I speak the real, the way I feel
How come we call bitches hoes and y'all call us niggaroes?
They wanna do me like they did Stax
What is this young black man doing with all that scratch? Huh
I see some timers on the yayo track readin' they mail
Talking about ""I got white girl for sale""
But they ain't talking to me 'cause see I'm an oldie and they knows that
I used to be just like them, I tell them ""Y'all get that scratch""
Magazine was never nothing like Bel-Air
High-speed shootouts and shit, but I loved it there
""40, where you been, playa? It's been a while.""
'Marinatin', accumulating paper, pal'
""Y'all kinda doin' it, huh? You still grindin'?""
'Hell yeah, you know them tapes you keep rewinding'
Money ain't changed me, money changed the way people think about me
When I was broke all I had was my family
You know what kills me doe, them fuckin' numskulls
I hate when blacks be clownin' blacks on all these talk shows
It's bad enough we shootin' up each other tragically
Two days ago they found some brother smothered badly
Nobody's to be trusted in this day and age
Too much jealousy and envy on the wrong page
And fuck the po po's 'cause that 39% tax I pay
Don't get me nathan but a chokehold and some pepper spray

(So is that what they do?) It's all bad
(It's crazy out there, huh?) It's all bad
(Is it gonna be like this when I grow up?) It's all bad
(Daddy, sprinkle me with some more game)


Our Father who art in heaven
Hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come
That's the pray that I say so spread the word
And if you feeling down and out, read Proverbs
You know that I've been tweakin off, something strange
Startin' to see a lot of womens at the shooting range
Domestic violence but here's an old ghetto myth
My potna's auntie scold her boyfriend with some hot grits
I'm from the G-E double T-T to the oh no
Where only few dare to go

I spits game like a soldier, tonk since I told you this
The rap kingpin giant, six year old vocalist
You don't want to see me, do it like I do that
All up in your tall-can face, I tell you get more scrizatch
Y'all need to get up on it, the game is way to deep
I'm not your average hustler, I be creepin' while you sleep
Game, straight game
Get up on it, straight game

Mouthpiece,Charlie Hustle: The Blueprint of a Self-Made Millionaire,1999.0,"I don't need no iron I'm already creased
I don't need no money I got mouthpiece

Thug wit me who got that Indo nigga mug wit me
Stick yo' pistol out the window have a few drinks wit me
(Nigga) Nigga, smoke a few dubs with me
Nigga get fired (fired) up
Out of state dummy license plate, faulty ass tags
Trunk full of out door weed back seat full of garbage bags
Lookin' fo' that money train lookin' fo' that treasure
Like to fuck alot mix the business wit the pleasure
What's up old timer when you gone resign
Put a soul food restaurant in yo' mama's name and own your own clothing line
Ain't no tellin'
That's what Harold told Melvin back in the days of penny loafs
When Teddy Pendergrass was in the Blue Notes
A big lip street nigga was in the makin' a ferocious dangerous dude
A little microscopic seed marinatin' in the fallopian tube
Ready to face the world ready to say my speech
Ready to come out early feet first nigga breeched
Uno uno dos tres quatro
Drinkin' malt liquor out the baby bottle
Five five six six seven eight
Move from the Crestside to the Hillside
Go ahead ask the V.P.D
Betcha they tell you about me
Betcha they tell you they been investigatin' my ass since '83
Betcha they tell you the deal
Betcha they say dude real
Betcha they say I don't know how that nigga did it
But he sittin' on a few mill
All I gotta say is nemesis
Bet I know one thing betch you they know
Who shot my mama's house up that night on 
Magazine
Should I say I wanna take a face nah
Cause if the district attorney get this tape they might build a case
I'm high as fuck man inhalin' it beatin' on my chest like Tarzan
Hold it fo' ten
Five lucky to be alive
I only got one mo' album to do on Jive, an' I'm gone

I don't need no iron I'm already creased
I don't need no money I've got mouthpiece
Let's go half on a forty an' a twamp sack of broccoli
I got a car Deville Coupty
So what if its primer colored so what it's a hooptie
So what if the lifters tick I know I'm 40 Water
So what if I gotta get up under the engine an' tap the starter
In the morning eatin' cereal
Strapped with the .223 infrared material
Who come from nothin' who run the thirteen hundred block
Who used to top have to walk the streets floodin' wit holes in they socks
Who really real, how many know the deal
Who got they church clothes from the good will
Click shit makes a muthafucka's night
Niggas listen to it cause it's right
Money don't make me, I make money
What I look like fuckin' over a broad, playboy I'm a macaroni
I mean that bitch got miles on her she's a ho
I mean that bitch can teach the wind how to blow
She's a pro groupie though
Zulu jocka Binaca
The hood head knocka'
(Ooh-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, Forty Water, na-na-na-na-na) x2

I don't need no iron I'm already creased
I don't need no money I got mouthpiece
Sometimes I'm suited up sometimes I don't care
When I'm grindin' I don't brush my teeth or comb my hair
When I'm timin' I like to buy drinks
When I'm timin' it's Louis the thirteenth
Ballers you know how we livin'
You know how we meet 'em in the parking lot at Popeye's chicken
I can mesmerize a ho by jowsin
Can you make a G look like ten thousand
Where all my ghetto tycoon, beanie caps, and Kangols
Where all my niggas wit them federal beepers on they ankles
Where all the hood-ho dick teasers
Where all my beautiful Black intelligent divas

I don't need no money I got mouthpiece",https://genius.com/E-40-mouthpiece-lyrics
Gangsta Song,The D-Boy Diary: Book 1,2016.0,"I'm cut from leather not polyester
My cheddar long like tape measures
Stay with a Heckler and Koch protector, 9 mm behead ya
Charge your bitch like a Tesla or should I say bill collector?
Got more gold than a treasures, I'm a monster like Uncle Fester
When it comes to my family, I go back to pushin' that candy
That booger suger; that yayo
Or the broccoli, spinach or kale
On the front propeller
Whether Hillside or South Vallejo
Never rollover, or tell, do my time, go to jail
Showin', improvin' and
We never losin', we gamed up, never lamed up
Bitches be lovin' the way a player move
I'm fired up, like a firetruck
Like a barber shop, I line ya up, catch a fade, no hair cut
You could run up and get done up
Get a check up, from the neck up

This ain't no ordinary gangsta song, song

This ain't no gangsta song for you to sing along

I'm a top hat, a staple, tycoon, a factor; a pillar
Like Getty's, I'm in the picture, bitch, I'm a boss, I'm a fixture
I can tell you who real and who phony
Who counterfeit, who a mark
And I got a black belt in grittin'
A purple heart in street smarts
Me, my fan base, thicker than thieves
We sick With It, with no disease
I'm a OG in the game and I'm havin' my grilled cheese
You could tell by the way my diamonds be shinin' when I say cheese
First rapper on wax to ever say, ""fo sheez""
Fetty longer than the neck on a flamingo
It's more then just my raps and my lingo
And you can find me in Reno, up in the Peppermill Casino
You fuckin' with the original, gas nova instrumental
99 BPM tempo, trunk throbbin' slappin' tremendo

This ain't no ordinary gangsta song, song

This ain't no gangsta song for you to sing along

You really got fiends when you think you got friends
There's no ""I"" in team, but there's an ""I"" in win
Without the ""N"" it's still we, game changers at the end
Yup, no joystick needed
Studied the game system and I was forced to beat it
Never was automatic 'cause I did it manual

He was getting his money from them but then he had a couple of setbacks
But he's still a celebrity with bounce back skills and ability
Raised by O.G.'s that been in a correctional facility
The thing about this new generation, they hella quick to bust they guns
Without thinking about the repercussions they relatives and loved ones
I can look a fool in his pupils and just tell what he about
By analyzing his hand-gestures and what come out his mouth
That come from being from it, experienced and seasoned
From hustling monday through friday, clubbing and going to church on weekends
That's why I had-pick my friends, never know what they'd do
Trust no human, just G-O-D and you
I stay looking at my rear view
I stay looking over my shoulder
Never know who want me out here
Never know who want me over
I can tell tall timber from tiny brush
I know the difference between a cabbage and the lettuce (bitch!)

Pull up a chair, and get you a taste
Of the sun-caked game, no chase (Motherfucker, I'm laced)
I ain't never been fake
Everything I said about you I say it to your face (I'm laced)
On eights, looking like skates
I never been late, learned the game from the grace (Nigga, I'm laced)
Stay in your place, and don't hate
Cause fucking with me ain't safe (Unh!)

If you can't cook stay out the kitchen, if you can't swim get out the ocean
Don't hop in the yola game if you're soft as Jergens Lotion
Believe half of what you see, and none of what you hear
Analyze that fool before you let him get in your ear
Sleep with one eye open, and one eye closed
In case the thirsty and dusty try to kick in your door
Never tell a homey how you make love to your woman
Cause he might be the same homey who wanna fuck your woman
There's three sides to every story, there's mine's, your, and the truth
Niggas loose they lives every day over a booch
You can fuck around and get stamped, fucking around with a tramp
Running around here loose without no structure in your camp
What niggas need to do is stay up off them phones, (Right?)
Bragging about the nigga you popped and killed last night
Cause then the dark gon' come to light, the streets talk
Next thing you know you body all lined in chalk on the sidewalk

I read The D-Boy Diary, The Hustler's Encyclopedia
The Player's Pamphlet, The Hood Wikipedia
The instructions and manual on how to handle certain situations
When you're dealing with fake smiling faces
And they say there's traitors and haters
You can look out for the homey with flying colors
But if you don't do it that one time, you a bitch motherfucker
Ain't that fucked up, what part of the game is this
Brother, throw me a bone, I'mma appreciate it
I stick to the script, I'm a laced individual
Keep a clip on my hip, and under my pillow
Never leave your drink unattended when you're rounding up on a cutie
Might be a setup broad, might slip you a goofy
I'll be damned if I go out that way, feel me
I make her take a sip, if she don't drink it that mean she guilty

""Momma I'mma do what the fuck I wanna!""
Hit the streets and make a wheelbarrow full of bread if I end up dead
Then press delete, I'm tired of eating potted meat
Within the nick of time a nigga hit the grind, so a dope boy scored a quarter key
Two hundred and fifty-two electronic milligrams
We'll sell rock coke candy, the organization
That I'm plugged with, they off into that old high-powered shit
These are the type of niggas that'll let a nigga know
When the drought about to hit, 
, post it on God
Because me got me scratch paper buried in the backyard
Me and my Click roll thick f'real don't be fakin' the funk like you a boss
Problems nigga? Let that go or get your head tooken off
Catch you out of bounds on the wrong fuckin soil
Wrap that ass up like aluminum foil

Hustle Charlie water that playa there hella coo!

Kilo grams of coke and that broccoli I used to weigh it
Smokin' Ahfganny in the candy blue drop Camaro
On my way to Richmond to buy me some new apparel
Bendin' corners, gettin' it crooked and talkin bout look it

She can teach frosty how to snow, right, glow

Buy low, sell high, my marble route
Know about the weather before its about to change

Watch out for them folks and them K-9's sniffin them thangs
Bricks, kicks, hittin MC's and door panels man

Got the mouthpiece of a pimp (and what?)
And a perm like Reverand Sharp' (Sharp')
Now tell me if I'm wrong (wrong)
If I open up my, own barbershop, and get me a small business loan
Gotta lay it down for a minute (whatcha gon' do?) Do what you do
If you in the jail, don't let the jail get in you
And the C-H-P's think they slick, trick
They got a new device out there for high-speedin called the spike strip
See potnah dude right there (uh-huh) he talk more shit than my batch

As a youngster, I never knew nothin'
That disobedient child in the neighborhood
You know, the one the police was always chasin'
Straight down and dirty for my props
Eleven years old, extra mannish, hard-headed shinin' rocks
I carried a powerful lookin' oversized toy that was much much bigger than me
Prettiest thing I ever seen, a 1979 AR-15
Clean, fully automatic and the whole killer kit
As far as me walkin' up and down the street, folks be pointin' they fingers talkin' about ""Partner got a grip""
Actually, what I was doin' was protectin' my people’s million dollar spots
It was my duty, I got paid to patrol the whole motherfuckin' block
Try and catch me if you can now that I'm a grown man though
The mail that got stashed away, people’ll never know
Mr. Flamboyant

Yeah, pertainin' to this bein' a dog world and all
People need some kind of occupation to make their mail stand tall
Whether it's slangin' ‘em or whatever ya do, mayne
Just make sure you true to the game

Still in the game, everything pretty much the same
Tryna reach a certain goal but I gotta ditch the highway patrol
, Feds and the DEA
Yeah, just to run up on me when I'm off that there Grand Marnier
Well what if they blast you and slap yo’ butt in the trunk
Potna, if if was a fifth all of us would be drunk
Don't even like righteously trip off of a little petty punk stuff like that
What is you sayin’, buddy? Might be talkin' 'bout how he’s to the back
Meanwhile, Boosie was comin' around the corner on two shoes, I mean wheels
Scattin’ in the ‘76 Cutlass Oldsmobile
Turnin' 360s like he was an Alaskan 
Sittin' on gold ones high-flamin' and didn't really know the deal (Mr. Flamboyant)
I said, ""What in the world is wrong with you, you crazy young brother?""
Partner back there tried to mean mug me and turn two tight ones like I was a sucker
Well, slow ya lil' tail down this here side of town
Before you find yourself melted or either beat down

Like that, and that's on the gooch side
Because nowadays a dollar's too hard to come by
So if you out there in that world don't get caught up or be slippin’
‘Cause today's society ain't trippin'

Mr. Flamboyant, yeah, that just might be yo’ name
The center of attention, money, fame (Mr. Flamboyant)
Messin' with a young girl’s brain, a player, insane
Leader of the squad, much yola, a gang
See he rides around in one of the freshest cars in town
Insurance, license, registration in case he's clowned
You can like righteously tell that Mr. Flamboyant when he gets put in jail
As far as mail he gets out the next minute pertainin' to a three thousand dollar bail
Solid as rock, right, left, right, duke and fight
Knockin' them suckers day after day, night after night
Whether you know it or not, this here's a dog’s game
You gotta watch ya back and play it well
Way too many brothers gettin’ took for large lump sums of mail
You can't be frail and don't be light in ya lil’ narrow tail
Gain some weight, drink beer with potatoes and gravy, it’s not too late
Become a savage, get swole but once, 20-inch arms establish
One-hitter quitters, the whole get down, don't run up on me now

Uh, E, why you come at ‘em like that, mayne?
You know they can't understand that
When you doin' about a buck-fifty, mayne
But now, put that in perspective for ‘em though

Ay, check this out my sohabs
Due to the fact that I am at liberty
To release such valuable information towards the public
Ya know what I'm sayin'
Every last one of my sahobs been like hollerin' at me
Demandin' that I define the definition of Mr. Flamboyant
Pertainin' to me righteously havin' inherited the gift to spit
So I had to like let loose

Like that
Well ya know the stuff is good listenin', mayne
But now I want you to go back to that tune that you was doin' earlier in the song
You know that lil' tune ya was doin'

Ah, you mean this here:
Yeah, I'm just a hustler on the go
Out here gettin' my propers don't ya know
I'm livin' kinda comfortable, large mail and all
And a lot of jealous fellas would love to see me fall

Been in the game for 20 years and I'm 40 years though?
6 A cougar, 40 years cold
40 ounce of brew, 40 this, 40 that
40 at the crap table shooting 40 stacks
40 thousands fans, 40 niggas on stage
I heard 40's 40 but 40 don't act his age
40 stay relevant, 40 ain't never played
40 ain't a punk, 40 will pull the gage
40 years change with the hawk sitting on her
40 ain't left the hood, 40 around the corner
40 like to drink, 40 be getting drunk

Water my grass and my green gone grow
It takes water to live, it's water under the bridge
Water with the baking soda whipping up kids
It's a drought without water, the soil can't crack
Water in the duals makes loud glass packs
My family know me by Earl but water my handle
All the gooing in the club, drinking water like a camel
Put some paint where it ain't, water based paint
If you don't drink no water, my ninja, you might faint
Water be everywhere but water from the V
Water be limping like he got water in his knee
Water pour, water simmer, water heat
Keep my head above water, still water run deep

Y'all be looking for a walk, I be swing for the fence
Under pressure, never tense, rhyming is a synch
Change the rap game when they let me up off the bench
Back with that 91 super Atlantic flow
I've done seen your favorite rappers come and go
I done seen a lot of blow, a lot of snow
I done seen my homie grandma get beat by the po-po
In the hill side of Vallejo, County of Selano
Get off a magazine and meet me over there by McDonald's
That's why I used to get my yola stacks off
Back then I was small time, all I had was rocks

Mack Minister,Tha Hall of Game,1996.0,"I'd like to thank the mack god for all tha playa prophets that he sent
I'd like to thank him for Donald Goines and Iceberg Slim
For dottin their I's and crossin their T's, poppin their P's, and
Flexin their G's
I'd like to thank the mack god for all the playa prophets that he
Sent before me and 40 water
For the mack I chose 40 water
To come into the world and change and rearrange
To lace the suckers and the anti playa
He came in the middle of the Atlantic ocean, on the glad sandwich bag
And floated ashore
And as soon as he hit the shore, he balanced the game
He said that nine-tenths of his law was possession
And that nine-tenths of his game was position
And that everything was done on the approach
The mack god said that he would send an extraordinary one
On the side of 40 water and he won't just be a playa
He will be an extraordinary playa
Now we gonna turn the mack book from page 211 to chapter 187
And it talks about how they had a kangaroo court for the playas
And how dem suckas is out there with trumped up charged on E-40
Well, if you wanna judge the 40 water, bring him before 12 G's
And open his files
And you will see that he has been true with a capital T since he
Was knee high to a grasshopper
That the mack god said that in the year 1555, that there was a
Great explosion and some of the playas inhaled some fumes
Pertaining additives, preservatives and artificial flavors
The mack god refers to them as suckas
And he said that he would send one that would come from one
That was despised and rejected
And that he would send this extraordinary one in the world
And when he come, he would come with ten commandments
And the commandments would be:
Thou shall not snitch
Thou shall not infiltrate
Thou shall not perpetrate
Thou shall not playa hate
Thou shall not hoe trust
Thou shall not hoe save
Thou shall not pay a trick
Thou shall not disrespect the game
Thou shall not be broke
And thou shall not be without that thang
The mack god said that just because you meet a hoe
And she wears a jersey that say champion and eat a bowl of wheaties
Don't make her a winner
Will she sell her hips, her lips and her fingertips
Will you tear down doors
And knock out CO's
Can you go the distance
Will you be the one with the checkered flag in your hand
Yeah, cuz I will be the winner",https://genius.com/E-40-mack-minister-lyrics

Suckers in my mix man, he say, she say
Dress up like a bitch man, all day e'ryday
Selling promethazine, hopping weed, crystal meth, and bricks
Independent rappers dealing with radio politics
After parties, merchandises, shows, and verse licks
Internet and type of twitting tryna strike it rich
Fussing with my broad 'cause I ain't got a jaw
I ain't hittin' them draws, she calling me a dog
Grabbing and complaining like she goin' through menopause
Breaking out my window for scratching up my calls
I ain't got time for this shit, I'm way too silent for this
I got money to get, I'm 'bout to find this bitch
I'm on parole, the government got my soul
They want me back in the beam
To shoot a practice scoop the toilet bowl
Bitch!

I'm over the stove (Stove)

Saying I'm just saying I ain't playin'
I'm over the stove

Over the stove in the kitchen cooking cha-cha
With a pickle jar and a pot of boiling water
Add a Smith & Wesson, 30 round choppa
Man I like a nigga who lode it down with this pow pow
I can do whatever I got to do to make it through
'Cause if this rap shit don't work, man I'm telling you
I got mouths to feed, filthy and hella bills to pay
And I believe in myself my nigga, this nigga on his way
And ain't nobody goin' put my hustle to a holt
I'm tryna climb up the rope and wiggle my way up to the top
I got bars for days I'm dope in the studio line stump
Can't let 'em sink my boat because they'll jealousy a plot
I'm hella hungry and I'm starving and I'm thirsty
Pimpin' my money so funny it's telling jokes about me
If I ever catch a brick, I'll buy a realty
I want the fame the cars the feddy and the jewelry
Bitch!

I graduated from a sipper to a burden
I'm over the stove
I can't talk right now my grandma's hands dirty
I'm over the stove

I'm a one dollar near fanalited
Hopefully one day in the future I'ma be a cash cow
Kick back and watch my money pile
But until that day arrives, I'ma hustle 'til I rise 'til I blossom
And in the back in they mind they know that I'm a problem
And once I get on this snowman I'm a stay on my birthmark
Long as I play my position to play my part, I'm smart
And I'm a stick with the slang word that I had before, if I make it
Fuck a video ho, she was down when I was foe, can't fake it
I been rapping my ass off man I'm a mess, a mess
When I'm gone, they goin' be saying I was the best, the best
That ever did it and got away with it, living a halfway with it
In and out like the burgers
See the po-po will let'chu walk wherever as long as it's no murders
Long as it's no witness
Keep a low profile stay lowkey, they goin' get off in yo business
Fake it 'til I make it, man I ain't even got krump
If I look like I got some money ain't nobody goin' wanna give me none

The Story,Tha Hall of Game,1996.0,"""Here's a little story I got to tell""
""And this list goes on, again and again""
Uh, Uh

I think it goes, ya live by the dirt, ya die by the shovel
You can repent and come with God or you can go with devil
You can go and get a job or you can do some federal
But if I were you, I'd straighten up and do some next level
Huh, I often tweak when I drives
How can a small town like Vallejo have all these homicides?
Man, fools be droppin' like flies
Maybe we need more brothers selling bean pies
And it's a fool 'cause everybody mama's know each other
It ain't cool, but you know black folks like to act they color
Wonder why all the good people get put through
So many different changes of the weather
And all those folks that do wrong seem like they live forever
I wish I can rewind time
Remember when we used to get free lunch, and the city bus used to cost a dime
Runnin around, talkin' about you got the cooties
Liftin up skirts, and touchin' girl's booties
Boy, take those shoes off before ya come up in this house
And whatever you do, don't you sit on grandmama's plastic covered couch
Why is it that when all the homies get together, we go back in the days
And how come every time we get drunk somebody bring up AIDS?
Life is something you can't borrow and give back
Here today and gone tomorrow, just like that
Pat your abs on your back
Take some time out yo waltz
Tell your loved ones that you love them every so often

""Here's a little story I got to tell""
""And this list goes on, again and again""

Uh, fetty is the key to the end of all your worries
Contemporary crib, cash, cars and clothes
But fetty 'cause problems like guns and spears
Families fall out and don't talk for years
Like my cromey (Like my cromey)
They called him Big Bread Ed
His first cousin set him up and left his ass for dead
Churches, wakes, nothing unusual
Seem like every other damn day I'm buying a brand new suit for a funeral
Have your pockets ever lost weight, and you ain't even tried?
Did you wonder if your cash was on a diet?
See, when you're up, everybody wanna come around
But when you're down, ain't nobody out there to be found
If you love someone you should tell 'em often
Ya never know when they'll be layin' in a coffin
Dedicated to my weeples up in jail
Ya partner 40 Water gotta story to tell (a story to tell)

""Here's a little story I got to tell""
""And this list goes on, again and again""

They can take the ninja out the ghetto (the ghetto)
But not the ghetto out the ninja
Give me life for three rocks, but I won't surrender
Oh, he's a heathen (heathen), look at the way he dress
He must be dealin (dealin), how did he get that Lex?
Of course, if it ain't used get spokes, it's crime and coast
That's all they worth
Shootin' shit up and actin tough, ridin' around with gold and stuff
It's rough—How much money you earn?
Enough, I own my own law firm
Don't need a tux, I twerks pea coats and khakis (khakis)
Levi's and T-shirts (Levi's and t-shirts)
Whatever the street's works (street's works)
Partner deuce, you been actin' kinda funny lately since you done got a few bucks
But I'm still folks, Wilson Park, remember three flies up
And this goes on, again and again
This goes on, again and again
Ain't nothin' changed but the territory
Same time, different day, different story

Beastin,Revenue Retrievin’: Overtime Shift,2011.0,"Eeuungghh

Uhh
I'm elevated
I'm floating on cloud nine times out of ten
You can find me with a cup in my hand
Filled to the rim with oil
Throwing up the middle finger
But I'm not an alcoholic I'm just a serious social drinker
Heavy thinking, thumper toting, don't trust nobody but I
Cause the scandalous be plotting, and if they could they would try
Like last night at the club
God as my witness
I was sitting at my table
Minding my own business
Living it up to the highest
Like every day is Christmas
A sucker tried to try us
Hating on our riches
I guess they didn't like us
Cause we got all the bitches
But they didn't want to fight us
Cause my niggas we the shiznit
Fuck compromising, explaining, and trying to reason
We'll catch 'em outside of the club and leave them niggas leakin'
I be beastin

One lonely beasty I be!
(Beast don't suck up to none, don't be no sucka)

When my money was hecka small
I made it look like it was tall
Punch a hater up in his jaw
If he didn't want to shake my paw
When I used to push that raw
On the other side of the law
Where the prices fluctuate and go up and down like a see-saw
Nah this ain't no hee-hah
Clown shit, this real
I slap a busta with the heel of my hammer up out my skrill
I take a uptempo track
Put some game behind my rap
I'm like that
Motherfucker I'm a mack
Hide yo back
Before she fuck around and get snatched
I'm from the flats
The Hillside to be exact
Cattin off and sipping ain't what this playa do son
There's only like seven real niggas left on this earth
And I'm one of them
I be beastin, bitch da man'e, mannish little old heathen
The rawest nigga speaking
They call me Earl Stevens


Bosses do what they want
Suckas do what they can
Aauuaauuaaggghh
I'm feelin like Tarzan
Gotta pocket full of money and I'm confident
Gotta fifth of landy cognac and some romulan
Some romulan?
Yeah, some cheebah
It's handling but my strain of choice, is sativa
When she was young she wasn't looking all that tight take Meagan Good for example
Now she looking right
I'm about to take her down tonight
I be beastin in the bed
I like 'em dark, light and bright
Yellow-bone and red
I'm loaded and I'm twisted and I'm faded!
In the function gettin' white boy wasted!

I’ma Teach Ya How to Sell Dope,Revenue Retrievin’: Day Shift,2010.0,"Bust open the yola, then you throw it in the pot
Mix that soda with that water, make that motherfucker lock
Chop it up and bag it, then ya flood the whole block
With that candy, cha-cha, white lobster, ready rock

(I'ma teach you how to sell)
(I'ma teach you how to sell dope)
The money come fast when pushin them grams
You get what you can, there's no retirement plan

Every move that I make is a calculated step
Gotta be careful what you say and who you conversatin with
I came in the game with nada, I left with a couple of dollars
That's the way I wanna be remembered up in this here yola game, partner
See, it's 'posed to be temporarily and momentarily but I'm stubborn
I put everything in my alias, I don't put nothin in my government
Stay with a cinnamon roll extension, extra cartridge drawn
Ain't no retirement plan or pension, catch you slippin, run
I got straight A's across the board, my ghetto report card never flunked
They gon' have to kill me on the spot, I ain't gettin off in nobody's trunk
Never take my chances by fuckin them up and punch
Scuffle and try to take his gun
I rather get a flesh wound 'stead of land up in A TIN ROOM
""Throw me a stimulus package, my niggga, throw your nigga a bone""
That's what my OG said to me when he touched down, when he came home
I reached up in my pizznockets, shot him a thou-wow and a zone
Got a digital scale application on my iPhone

If you plan on goin to yolanary school, one of the first things they teach ya
Give your mama enough money to bury ya
And if you're backed up in a corner and the po-po Elroy question you
Never give up yo plug and tell on you or your crew
Some of the perks and amenities and benefits of sellin D
If you a ghetto celebrity you can almost get anything for free
Bitches gon' wanna fuck ya, and niggas gon' wanna be ya
Haters gon' wanna pluck ya, so you better pack a squeezeer
Every swing of the bat, every snap of the ball, every lay-up and free throw counts
I know some dudes that been gridin for years and the police still ain't never found
No cha-cha, no dope on 'em, you know why, cause he don't touch it
And he don' be braggin, flycoonin and showin off, he drive a bucket
We didn't bring in all this dope, you traffic patrollin coast guard
We don't own no planes and boats, in the ghetto we got it hard
I'ma keep it all the way 300, I'ma keep it all the way funky and solid
I got mo' partners behind them walls than I do in college

Ridin with a couple of bricks, and the police on yo hips?
Take they ass on a high speed, throw the Yizzolo over the bridge
And if it ain't no water around, throw that shit up on a roof
That way it ain't hand to hand and they ain't got no proof
Always let somebody in your circuit know who you coppin your sugar from
Just in case you end up, wind up havin a little more dough than him
Cause dudes be gettin jealous and put yo head on a platter
Funkin lesson number seven - never outshine the master
In the cha-cha game, wanna know how to sell dope proper?
One of the things you better do is go to your local trucker store and purchase a kick do stopper
Made by Master Lock and under yo mattress in yo capness you better have a chopper
Or a Glock or a stapler or a thumper or a pistol
A rifle or a Uzi for the smunkish and the goony
Keep yo conversations limited, snitchin is prohibited
Take it to the grave with ya, never say who did it

Swerving Xan too, diamonds be clean
I’m the 10th mill, have me hot for 10 weeks
Sippin on it, grippin on it, whippin on that foreign
Now I’m beefin on er all night
And I’ll be a ghost in the morning

Get up early, tell that bitch to give brain
Then brush my teeth with champagne
Then brush my teeth with champagne
Then brush my teeth with champagne",https://genius.com/E-40-champagne-lyrics
Ballin’ Outta Control,The Mail Man,1993.0,"Pushed in the game at a young age
Feel me touch me as I turn the page
A little past ten, roughly about
Eleven years old dropped in the good location
My scratch is smellin sour and it's stinkin
Got a nigga seriously thinkin
""How can I kill this odor, and purchase me a Lincoln?""
Minimum wage flippin patties - nope
I'd rather fuck around with Coca-Cola, yola
Ice cream, candy, granola, huh
Slave for men - that's what they told me
And I'll break you off somethin suitable
Brought you a key of crack quicker than ?
? recoupable
? future black and beautiful
My partners used to be plucked and ugly
Hangin around them old squeegee boys
Man them the motherfuckers that have love for me
They straight cut for me
Deal me, touch me, L-O-V-E
E-to-the-F-to-the-R-T-Y
I spits the shit from the T-O-P
It's me, the E, droppin it nuclear all the time
Motherfucker comin from the motherfuckin.. mud
Fuck you niggas, you think I sell my soul
But I'm way too cold, motherfucker!
Chorus: LeVitti
Sittin in my livin room
Thinkin of, a master plan
Tryin to find a way out
Then I snatch the scratch, and laugh
So I painted me a picture
Of a life, to make a dream
Can you feel me now
Ballin outta control, ballin outta control
Fresh off the showroom flo', bought me a ninety-fo'
Now I'm havin long money, like Ross Perot, so take
Notes from a big ol' ? pimp, pretty much established
Livin out of hand lavish
Throwin parties ?
With big time folks makin big time cabbage
Become a savage, get swoll by ones
Twenty a drum's established
Six figure digits, just like I tell you like
I got the whole city sewed up in stitches
Your product'll win if you gots top grade
Keep, your law-yers and your bail bondsmen paid
The word on the street's is that I done came up too fast
Motherfuckers want a piece of my soul
Playa haters wanna cut my grass
You don't wanna bring your bitch
To what type of ? out of control sittin on tickets
Million dollar spots, technology chops
And a motherfucker proud fool-assed ridiculous
Straight fuckin em up like that, throw me my strap man
? feel me
Reverend would you put some blessin oil on my head
And hear me
I never sell my soul cause I'm way too cold
Motherfucker! Ballin outta control
Interlud: LeVitti
This ol' game, kids they run
Never get a second chance
So take me to this world
Now there's always time, to getcha
I guess by now you get the picture
Of what I'm tryin to say
I'm ballin outta control
""Niggas trippin off me cause I was a young motherfucker ballin""
""Every other fuckin day I'm tellin my sahies how to quit""
""Niggas trippin off me cause I was a young motherfucker ballin""
""We can get it on, we can get it on""
""Niggas trippin off me cause I was a young motherfucker ballin""
""Forty-Water, straight lettin em know""
""Even though my pocket's fat and my belly's bigger..
Gots to come Sic-Sic-Sic-Wid-It""
Throw, the ho
Y'know in a big ass gumbo pot
Full stir
Let it settle to make it lock
Horse races, trips to Vegas, frequent flier
""Whassup you timah, when your ass gonna retire?""
I ain't knowin
Keep tellin myself that I'mma call it quits
But I got myself
Too much motherfuckin cabbage out there runnin in the streets
Lookin up out the way for the one-time
Po-Po Penelope seriously concentratin
Noided as I watch the back for all of my chemistry
Cause fools be playa hatin
Lucrative spots and blows, investments bonds and stocks
Esquired land and crops, techno chops and Glocks
Cause niggas be tryin to make movies
When they get all in front of these bootch ass hoochies
I be like poppin the cap like a hungry mother
I ain't even gon' lie I'm to'
Twoasted, looped, to' back, souped
Plastered, puked, on the get back fully recouped
Fuck these niggas they think I'll sell my soul
But I'm way too cold, motherfucker!
Chorus
 Yeah yeah, I'm ballin outta control
 Out of motherfuckin control
 I'm ballin outta control
 Cause I'm way too cold
 Yayayy, I'm ballin outta control
 MotherFUCKER! Ah yeah
Feel me main

Talkers, they say I won't last, but I surpass
Every nigga that hated, look at me momma I made it
I started with a pinch of that yowda when I was jugglin'
Then my yapers started tripling, quadrupling then sextupling
North California where the hustlers reside
Where we learn to keep our silence like carbon monoxide
Some of my homies go to school to be a cook or a chef
Some of my fellas in the slums sell marijuana and meth
Never met Condoleezza, but I got rice for sale
On the Hillside of Vallejo helping my momma pay her bills
Taking my chances on going to jail, avoiding them prison walls and them cells
E'ery now and then I like to spoil myself
Got rich thrice, then I did it again
Shoutout to Obama for letting my folks up out the pen
Everyday my birthday I don't know about you

Forreal, quarter million no deal my nigga
Scrambling in the field for chicken I gotta get it

Narrate this shit right quick

He ain't playin' with a full deck, he been goin' through a lot of shit
Put holes in ya like a hairnet, bust his 50-clip
Picked the wrong nigga to fuck with and the wrong day to do it
He'll air this bitch out like a muthafucka pooted
And diarrhea at the mouth is forbidden
Everybody know who did it, but ain't nobody fibbin'
His cuz'n'nem on the road, they rap, they ghetto gold
In a Sprinter van, fuck a bus on promotional tour
Young niggas, they savages, they mamas is on dialysis
They daddy the streets, the streets raised them lil' bastards
So, what you 'posed to do if you was them?
If they die today, they'll go to Heaven
Nobody taught 'em bout the Lord and the afterlife
Daddy in the bing, mama on the pipe
Life is a gamble so I'mma roll the dice
You only live once, not twice

Man, the streets so ugly
Niggas dyin' out here to get some money
Aw man, if you knew what I knew
You'd be ridin' 'round here strapped too
Oh man, can't trust ya own partners
Niggas see ya comin' up and try to rob ya
All day, if you knew what I knew
You'd be ridin' 'round here strapped too, Lord

Get a check from the work move around and bent
Got a condo in the city, you don't trust shit
Not even ya bitch, got a baby by her
Ya taught her how to trick, turned her to a liar
She be sellin' fire in the intersection
Talk about her flaws and her imperfections
Lookin' for the love in the wrong section
So she only sexin' after she collectin'
When them times get wicked and yo' feelings too
And them niggas you with, talkin' killin' you
And that bitch you hit, he hit too
So, who you gon' trust when it's time to?
Puttin' mine's in the hands of the Most High
Abraham and Jacob, the 12 tribes
The Lord comin' back, wink of eye
Repent for the sins, turn back to Jah


I got my life, health and stress so I'mma say it
When life deal me a crap hand, I play it
Hood tax? I'll die before I pay it
Not a hater, wanna see all my niggas make it
I slap E-40 and B-Le like my dad
Drunk? Call Uber or a cab
All my life I been a hustler, I ain't never been lazy
That's what I told my young comrade

I run numbers in the summer, free the weed right now
Got a nigga in Virginia, need the tree right now
Ya niggas ain't knowin', I could see right now
Put the message in the music on the beat right now
OG on the case, got the cases of slur

Sho nuf ain't bootsee boss and thats for sure
Cuz bootsee be frontin himself off y'all niggas just don't know
The ones you least expect you know them square ass niggas in your city
They be the ones who have a grip , they be the ones who be sittin pretty
Instead of tryin to be super to start a fuckin track man
What a nigga really need to do is sit back and straight stack man

In case some of y'all ain't knowin this
Do to do almost anything to be noticed
Like ah
Pull out his whole bank account
And dang near everything he owns
And ah
Tell everybody in the hood that he got a chip in his phone
And how the fuck you gone be about you scratch when you gossip like a
Batch
And all them fools know where your stash be at
That ain't no sharp shit
Nigga that's that ho shit
Potna just keep on doin what you do and watch your perv get peeled
Ridin around here loose stickin out dumb like a soar thumb
Nigga tell the truth
Don't have a gun but I need one
You want to come up quick in this old shit so you can get it
But how the fuck you gone make your revees givin out credit
To tweakers, droamers, drifters, leftovers, geekers, zombies
Folks that steal from they mommies
When I was doin my thang I had strategy main
Sellin' that ""white girl"" you should have seen me main
You would have been proud of yo nigga cuz I was briliant wid it

Y'all ready to get crunk (YEAH)
Aww Shit
(Intro)
Lets go baby girl, Let's go
Lets get the muther fucking flow, baby girl let's girl
Everybody in the club got the flow for sho'
Some mother fuckers slap on backs for sho'
Now let's go
Let's go baby girl, Let's go
Let's get the muther fucking flow, baby girl let's girl
All my niggas in the club got the flow for sho'
Some mother fuckers slap on backs for sho'
Now let's go

I don't think y'all understand whats about to go down right now
DJ Kayslay the drama king in the building with my nigga E-40
Yo Rick Rock, this is cracking right here baby
I need everybody to turn this shit up loud as you can
And rock to this shit like never before, Let's go!!

Never running out of lingo
Forty water right back at 'em with another single
Money longer than the neck on a flamingo
Twenty-thosand on a bet in a casino
I got a partner on parole that just got out of Chino
Not a rookie but a vet, like Dan Marino
My favorite actor on the set, Al Pacino
This is a heater man, hot, like jalepeno
Follow the leader
Forty from Califoolya, you hear it in you speaker
My life ain't no cartoon, i'ts not animated like Cita
High like a hot air ballonist, I'm just an opportunist
The sooner the better you let me know you we can do this

Exuse me lady I've been looking at you from over here
I was wondering if I could buy you a beer and maybe later we can cut
I don't wanna be your man, I don't wanna be, let's have a one night stand
I know I don't know you and stuff but maybe we can get to know each other
Over a couple glasses of whatever in this cup
I don't wanna go and dance, I don't wanna, let's have a one night stand

Let's get it cracking like some broken bones, money mackin'
Talking on those burnt out phones, Cadallackin'
Wood grain dash and doors and floor mats
Good game, cash, I stash and store raps
PS2 clarity, diamond watches, super bad botches
Ankler and Cotches
 and Choppers fresh out the boxes
I like to polish my rims and tires, hundred spoke wires
With Armorol baby wipes because them Daytons require
Nothing but the best on flesh, just like sex
Rubbin lotion all on her Gluteus Maximus
I don't see no ring, all I see is miss sixty jeans
Walking through the club like she ready to do some things
Full of that turtle got Forty smelling like skunk
But everybody know you can't smell yourself when your drunk
Posted at the bar lookin like a star, I ghetto ball
Two way me your number, I'll give a player a call


This is for my folks in Zalets and all my guys
There's a new rapper in town, E-40's on the rise
Known for having Sic Wid It records and Jive ties
Business man, always at work like Barry Wise
The guy with all the slang in the game, up out the Yeh
Gorillas, 
Marie world
 Africa USA, ya feel us
Its sick out here in the Bay where we stay
We killas, I wish someone would come and pray
Live life like their ain't no tommorow, ain't no tommorow
Life is something that you can't borrow, that you can't borrow
Every days a holiday, every day man we celebrate
Every day we modulate, every day man we perculate

Watch your hands (get up)
When we walking through (yeah)
Always remember (get up)
Who you talking to (get up)

Mob manish
This weapon in my possession'll make you vanish
I got potnas that speak Patois and Spanish
And they'll put one in your colon and your pancreas
I'm a top hat, I'm a whale, I'm a fixture, bitch, I'm a tycoon
I drink cognac like Kim Jong Un
You bound to find me chiefin' with my heaters, I'm a patient
Functioning at a party on an Indian reservation
All the youngsters, they love it, they call me 'dad'
'Cause I'm the rawest rapper the West Coast ever had
I sell liquor, music, edibles, and vegetables
I do bar mitzvahs, arenas, and hella festivals
When it comes to my jewelry, it's done right
These rappers got y'all fooled with their diamonds, them ain't real, them moissanites
My paper stuck up, it's conceited
My bank account obese, not bulimic...BIATCH!

Hold up, watch your hands (get up)
When we walking through (yeah)

I don't think you really know who you talking to, bitch

Players be loving the way a player move
When I go to my hood I don't get booed
Don't be a bottom feeder or a shellfish
Help your people out, don't be selfish
I Hussle like Nipsey and talk Slick like Mitchy
Desert Eagle pistol pack the Power like 50
My life is a highlight reel for real
Diarrhea of the mouth'll get you killed
I'm the oldest newest rapper in the industry
I've been spitting game for half a century
I could talk a flea off a Frenchie
Make an 18-wheeler truck pop a wheelie
The speakers in my Cut' act silly
These diamonds on the hush, quarter-milly
I'm always in a rush like I gotta pee-pee
They be hating on us 'cause they really wanna be me...BIATCH!

It's smoky up in here, so open up the vents
We heated up in here (With what?) with street instruments
My piranhas is hungry, we play for keep
We thick in this booch, we 60-something deep
We niggerish, booch, if you feel froggish, leap
Promiscuous, booch, sometimes we like to cheat
I'm spillin' my liquor, its all on my clothes
I'm smellin' like alcohol, 'bout to follow my nose
I'm mad doggin and thuggin, buckin and grudging
We off of them pills, and we ain't talking bout Bufferin
(Gold front and grills) like they do down south
(100 dollar bills) with furniture in they mouth
If you like it, I love it, when it's dry, it's a drought
If you dig it, I dug it, be about your paper route
If it's woofers, then sub it, clientele and clout
Party and clubbing, up in the building talking loud

Gotta get it while its good, ain't no time to wait
It's dangerous in my hood but plenty money to make
I'm drinking a beer, I'm smoking a swisher
I barely can steer, I'm full of this liquor
I handles my biz, I'm taking my exit
The Carquinez Bridge, pimp, Magazine Street exit
I pull up my truck, I'm slapping my songs
Stop at the 7-11, talking shit on my phone
Hustler by nature (nature), gangster by choice
I'm checkin' my pager, I'm checkin' my voice-
Re-up and re-coppin', peddlin' and pushin'
More keys than a janitor, my nickname is Bookman
Bitches be lookin', old-folk be starin'
Pattin' me down, searchin' the clothes that I'm wearin'

We gon' act a ass (push my Glock up in the grass)

AR-15, pimpin', M-16s
Without me, won't be no slang in the game, it'll be extinct
I've been bamboozled and hoodwinked, mayne
People hit with all kind of these identity thieves
Underrated and hated on by all these squares in the industry
Mayne, I'm a legend, pimp, they call me E-Four-O
Ex D-boy used to push that blow
Gas, break, dip, stop, and go
Ride the strip, hit the sto'e
You know that I bought it, you know that I got it
Had to cop a bottle of the blue Hpnotiq
Incredible Hulks, you know what I mean
Mix it with some dark and watch that shit turn green
Higher than an elephant's eye, me and my guys
Off the broccoli and hash, actin a ass...

You punkin' on me you goin' into danger
Me and the Don, ruff and down low ranger
Me thought me pot was comin' from Jamaica
No mess with stranger, no like imposta
Call me forecaster, we more like rasta
With the mix for ganja, I buy a lil cha cha
When they know inside, they blow sofa

Hustlers with flashy rides, bitches with big behinds

I'm maney I'm mannish, I'm cuttin' up
I'm havin' my dough or should I say pie crust?
I never move slow 'cause I'm always in a rush
You threaten me ho, I'm gonna have you touched up
You think I won't go my nigga? Then try your luck
We can go toe-to-toe and bet I fuck you up
I got moulah, chalupa bust your medulla
Never funk with a nigga that got gouda
The everyday attitude of a Bay boy
The wrong side of the bed I woke up today boy
Will get on your head and split your toupee boy
You let that bitch get in your ear just like an Android

Better do what I say right away

Clientele and climbing, trying to get ten figures
Try to wipe me out and I'm gonna get in your business
I say what I say and mean what I say what I said
When I get a speeding ticket, go to class I don't pay it
I'm a stingy motha fucka 'bout my chicken and bones
White boy wasted, bowls and bongs
Black boy faded, Backwoods and cones
Heem and vodka, high as a drone
I've been ballin' since a teen, on the scene, me and my team
Soil living, hot water, cornbread and navy beans
Beverly hillbilly, roosters, horses and goats
Got family in the ""The Boot"", Louisiana got kin folks
Bicoastal, not local, shop at Cavalli on Soho
My pistol on split your tamale, G-27-40

Lotta these suckas is bogus, losin their mind and their focus

The loudest talkers is always the brokest
Roast you with the toasters, leave you stinking like halatosis
Raising the rubble the struggle, gravel, the tar
Where they play with them drums and pluck you like a guitar
His bitch wanna cuddle, she tryna get us in trouble
She tryna make us a item, she want us to be a couple

Guess all them likes on your selfies bitch got ya mind all fucked up

It was only lust on the first night
Should've known then you wouldn't be right
But I had to give you a try
How was I supposed to know
That you were gonna tell me I was lousy
You had me in the dirt
While you look me in my face I

Threw off methods to make 'em think that I'm a geek

The way I was built from the gravel, the soil, the land
You can get killed if you out here cattin' and playin'
I'm fried, I'm burnt, I'm on 10, I stay turnt
Suckers tryna monitor the money I earn
I got the gift of the gab, could talk a rock off a cliff
 pill scraps, throwin' 100s to Crips
Blue bags, well deserved
C-notes, like Charlie Bird
My player partners straight up out the rich
Known for goin' hard on a bitch

Yeah, my nigga, these ain't ones
(These is hunedz, these is hunedz, these is hunedz)
My nigga, these ain't ones
(These is hunedz, these is hunedz, these is hunedz)

If you ain't really from the mob bitch

You was born with a silver spoon in your mouth, (what kind you have)
I was born with a rusty one,
 I had to get out there and help my momma out (real nigga shit)
Been a hustler since a younging (since a younging) keeping it lit like a cigarette camels humps
Plotting on me, better chill like goose bumps
You wanna tuck em homie, better pack your lunch like a multi task do two or three things at once
Get my dick sucked dropping it funky
And smoke a blunt, in the streets I'll never flump
I say it in your face when I sober I ain't gotta be drunk
Dramatics over badges MOB
Got a lot on that leaning the brocoli
Beverge site you 23 for a certain we get you gone
Sing at home when you belong with the mag and living your learning return the wood its on fire so let it burn
Respect that giving the gift is our


You rappers need to quit it with that mob shit
You wasn't in the kitchen tryna' lock shit
You wasn't on the block busting hot shit
You really need to stop you are not it
B he a boss he kept the block buzing
40 got a distorded shotty got it fludding
Niggas getting down thugging in the public
Hunnids on the old school hoes love it
Pardon me baby but I get around
And they dont make a sound all for the rounds
And I dont make a sound when they ask me
Rule number one stay task free
Masterd baby, but im so loyal
I fuck around with it when im on the loyal
And you dont fuck around know your own soyal
It made a real nigga wanna bounce for fun


I've been A1 since day one
Prolly sold more coke than ronald regean
Still in the kitchen with the bulletproof apron
With your bitch on her knees, begging
What you suposed to do? never poodle up to a man nigga
Never whip out if you ain't planning on squeezing the fucking trigga
Money dont make me I make money
What do I look like flumping over to broke?
Nigga ima mack around g

Got em back to the hood and they didn't go

Seven grand worth of bump for the trunks
Paid cash, all ones
Some old bitch came up to me and said, ""What's the latest, bro?""
I said, ""I'm tryin to have more chips than Las Vegas, ho""
She said, ""Can I roll with you? I get the dicks hard""

Prices, go up and down like a teeter-totter
Filthy shit, ring around the collar

It's the way I was raised
It's the way I was raised
It's the way they raised me
It's the way I was raised

Put up yo' dukes and put down yo' guns
Eatin' soup with a fork, crackers and crumbs
Livin' in the ghetto with the hustlers and bums
Sellin' dope to my best friend, daddies and moms
Life in the slum, in the gutter, and in the sewer
In the bottomless pits, where they say we ain't got no future
Po-po empty they clips, rifles and Rugers
Local law enforcement, FBI, state troopers
I was just lookin' at the news
Some people ain't got nothin' to lose
Then one of my dudes say
""God take care of babies and fools""
He grew up poor, shoes too little
Corns hecka sore, I seen this movie before
Keep your faith, say your prayer before you go to sleep
Get on yo' knees and thank God you on yo' feet

It's the way I was raised
It's the way I was raised
It's the way I was raised
It's the way they raised me
It's the way I was raised

My potna's broad been messin' around on him, but I'm scare to tell him
'Cause he might turn on me, thought we was family
Why peoples be takin' they anger out on people that go they back
Fallin' out over dumb stuff, somethin' as simple as that
Be careful on the phones, they might be hot as heater
You never know when they tapin' or got you on the loudspeaker
In real life, not a trailer or a teaser
This ain't Netflix for no actors right here
Who got a beer? I'm stressed out
When I was 12 years old, I had a paper route
Raised in the soil, you can't be a little hussy
Or a powder puff, gotta be thuggy
Money on my mind, grew up eatin' swine
Never talk or tell, never drop a dime
That's what the ave always woke me to
I guess the ave never spoke to you

It's the way I was raised
It's the way I was raised
It's the way I was raised
It's the way they raised me
It's the way I was raised

I remember in the day
I had to walk all the way home from school
That's the way I was raised
And look here, I recall
Sometimes, we had nothing at all to eat
And mama worked it out
That's the way I was raised

Respect your elders, talkin' back will get you took
My mama will give you certain looks
That's a warning when you going a little overboard
Back then, mamas would whoop you with extension cords
But I don't hate her for that
'Cause she the sweetest thing to her grandchildren, and that's a fact
And they wanna rap
My suggestion is let 'em do that
So many mothers lost they sons to the streets
It's sad when they get that phone call or knock on the door from the police
It's bad when our loved one's deceased
We glad when we know they're at peace
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
Too many of us be trippin' off small stuff
Keep your faith, say your prayer before you go to sleep
Get on yo' knees and thank God you on yo' feet

It's the way I was raised
It's the way I was raised
It's the way I was raised
It's the way they raised me

Make that booty earthquake let me see that shit shake
Left cheek right cheek make it vibrate
Breast meat thigh meat make it rotate
Round and round like a merry-go-round, girate
She got it from her auntie n 'em it's in her genetics
California face with a booty from Texas
Turn a preacher to a cheater
Brazillian wax beefer
Think like peanut butter in the freezer
Tricks wanna treat her
Ballas wanna buy
Captains wanna wipe her
Dikes wanna dike her
Jews bitches don't like her
Got her own money, Got her own biz
Got her own car, got her own crib
She wanna be passified, she wanna be saved
She wanna be rescued and captured laid and paid
She straight from the soil trapped the turf In her block
She runnin the funk she got the Beaut in her locks


Yeah man she said this her song
Everytime they play it it turns her on
It's Friday night, she's out there freakin
Work on the weekdays party on the weekend
Ass be wigglin when she start drinkin
Get too drunk girl then she start creepin
Shake that ass but don't do it too frequent
Bounce it real fast let me see those cheeks spin
Now get butt naked if I want it I see I get it and take it
With no strings attatched I meet girls at the club and I bring them back
Let's make a lot of love, that's the plan
Spend the the night together but I'm not your man
I got too many girls, I do em when I can
Finger in her curls, hand in her pants
(C'mon bitch)


Short, She got a future in her ass and I'm a fortune teller
Cause I can see me up in her like a mirror
Christi, Iree, Stella and Della
Spin that ass around like a helicopter propeller
Bitch I wanna see ya, Drop it like madea
Some shit I never seen, do the splits like a balerina
She can tip it over, let the meat roll
Stop it on the dime, she got booty control

None of my girls can't fuck with this
I don't even wanna see my other bitch
A fat ass on a pink toe
The white girl let the booty grow I think so
I fuck with, seÃ±oritas and the black girls
It's just another day in the max world
I'm too short, I pimps and I plays them
I don't give a fuck if she was Indian or Asian

You best read up on my history
I'm known to the world as Mr. F-L-A-M-B-O-Y-A-N-T
Killin' motherfuckers off crucial
Sittin' em' down mutual
Spittin' that ol' playa, gangsta shit
Tryin' to maintain a strong grip
V-Town, California where I was born, raised and grown
Since 1979 I been a hustler on the go
Pop-pos wanna harass
Me and Mac-D-Shot needed cash
Rocks wasn't groovin' at the time
So the boys kinda money was cuttin' grass
Leader not a follower, became a Hill-Side baller
Put together a group called the C-L-I-C-K
And I was the shot caller, I'm goin' federal

I'm just a hustler, I'm just a hustler don't cha' know
I'm just a hustler, I'm just a hustler don't cha' know

Why don't cha' get up on this mic
And spit some of that ol' gangsta shit back at em' man, would ya

I'm on the last nickels, they only made like four of
Front-row seats at the fights
Takin' long, expensive flights
I love playin' hully-gully
Cause I ain't nothin' nice on them dice
So before you gamble against a hustler, I advise you to think twice
Napoleon, macaroni, we serve hot-bellied pig
96, 6 big screen television I bought for my kid
Livin' kind of comfortable
40 comin through with the real number
From blocks and blocks away you can here the boom, blam, bumble
Full tank of petro, up the metro, I'm like federal
Hoes wanna get sexual cause they see me on a pedastal
Nibblin' on my jock, like my big, ol' black tool is edible
Tellin' you man these heifers now days is incredible
Dishin' them one time scouts
Through dark alleys, takin' other routes
Hoppin' over barb-wire fences, ditches, puddles, crickets
Mobbin' and squadin' hoggin' and guardin' bitches, check it out
Takin' and shapin' and makin' a bunch of riches
Yeah man, you can call me federal

Yeah man, these motherfucker be ridin' around here
In these bootsy ass cars and what not man
Takin' these penitentiary chances
And they ain't even got they grin on

For-real lunatics man willin' to kill for me
Way too much love in my organization, I can't afford to take no loss
MC's be seelin' them wolf tickets, but I be serious as fuck boss
It's all part of the rap game and that's the way it should be goin'

Might as well go on and admit it, it's who you know
Not how damn good you are

Scared man can't win, especially when I'm paper packin
Fetti stackin, mashin, flashin
I'm flashin, the Elroy's pulled me over
And put the flashlight to my window and told me I was speedin
And I got to, fa-lashin on they ass
I got to actin like a demon the motherfuckers told me
The other day I go to turn off my P-G-and-E
Nigga and I got to actin bad and I got to flashin
On a motherfucker, motherfucker come out there
Talkin crazy to me lookin at me crazy up in the motherfuckin sto'
And I said, ""Bitch I'm F-ah-lashin!""
Don't let me get to flashin on yo' ass nigga
Motherfucker up in the club, and a motherfucker step on my shoe
And I got to fa-lashin!
It's all bad, motherfucker used to be my comrade
Used to fuck the same hoes, wear each others clothes
Closer than a booger to a nose, Trues and Vogues
Slammin Cadillac do's together, cookin crack
Making eighteen zippers back, overkill
Put the whammy on the whoop, be on the lookout
For the state troop, might shoot
Durin the drug deal, flippy at the mouth
Voluntarily ratted your motherfuckin folkers out
Tight about since Little League, Boy Scouts
Paper route dropped a dime to get some days dropped
I'm uh, I'm ooh cranky, moody like a old hag
Shit gone get hella stanky if you square snitch-ass
Sucka butt-ass niggas don't bring me back my motherfuckin duffle bag
Consequences off the hinges
Lean ballin, alcohol and weed
A thousand dollars worth of chump change, chicken feed
A criminal record a full of dirty deeds
Givin niggas black eyes and bloody lips
Cauliflower ears and extra clips
Gun clappin music slappin party crashin
Blastin, motherfucker flashin
The holiday just came on the first second and third of the month
Made my check late and I got to, flashin on motherfuckers
Next door neighbor hollerin that shit about my beat too loud
I walked up the motherfuckin steps and I got ta
Tellin that bitch I'm F-ah-LASHIN
Sent a rookie to the store to bring me back some Rossi rhine
He brought me back chablis, and I got to FLASH
On that bitch ass motherfucker, silly nigga
Yknahmsayin? A motherfucker up in this motherfucker FLASHIN
Get to testin my testicles nigga and I'mma FLASH on yo' ass
Behind my back and it get back to me and I'm flashin
Lost all my money up in the dice game and I FLASH
Didn't let me up in the Club Cafe Echelon and go to FLASHIN
Dopefiend ran off with a hundred count of my defense and I FLASHED
B of A wouldn't cash my faulty money order
So I took it to Scottie's to keep myself from flashin
Bought $250 worth of liquor and they tried to charge me
For some ice and I FLASHED
Got jumped outside a house party and my fools left me for dead
When I got home I seen them motherfuckers
And they ass was in the red, I got to FLASHIN
I tell ya, bitch these niggas I tell ya
Shit I tell ya, SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT BITCH, shit!",https://genius.com/E-40-flashin-lyrics
Happy to Be Here,My Ghetto Report Card,2006.0,"(I'm just happy to be here!)

Hard times, the struggle
The ups and downs, the highs and the lows
You know just goin through it man, ghetto politics
Tryin to make a way out of no way
I was the oldest, so I had to be, the daddy of the family
Momma had to work three jobs, oooh
Feet stickin through my shoes, skid marks in my drawers
Garage sales and flea markets, we never shopped at malls
No dental plan, no medikit - we poor like rain
Colored folks think that castor oil cures everythang
Pork chops and chicken, we like our food fried
Hypertension, Prinivil pills and hydro-chlorizide
Some of my family still living, some of my folks done died
Health complications, natural causes and homicide
Just tryin to survive, nothin to lose but plenty to gain
Started hustlin, flea flickin and servin that candy cane
Put all my cars in my lady name, as a true hustler should
She had a 9 to 5, worked at Planned Parenthood
While I was in the hood, up to no good
With a hoodie over my head, tryin to outslick the feds
Or should I say cops, at this point in time I only had rocks
Went from a little jelly jar up to a soup pot
The fast quarter my negro, don't want the slow nickel
I done seen yola the same color as peanut brittle
I done seen hella people relapse
I done seen my homey grandparents go back to crack
How sick is dat? Beggin my loved ones to send some pictures
Pray for me over the phone and read me some scriptures
Oooh; it's gloomy out here, dark days ahead
God got my back but the devil he want my head

I'm just happy to be here right now
Lot of my folks been locked up or laid down
See I ain't sayin I ain't shed no tears, no
But I'm just happy to be here

Listen to this, oooooh
The devil-me side know that some of y'all done seen it
Somebody's momma washin her son or her daughter's bloodstain off the cement
Wrong place at the wrong time, infiltrators drop a dime
Mistaken identity, bullets start flyin
In every direction, hit a pregnant teen, she passed
But her baby live through a C-section
I know it sound foul and sound hecka rude, it ain't cool
But it go down like that sometime when you're funkin, and you're puttin down a move
We heartless and shrewd in this day and age, it ain't the same
Our parents need to beat us with a belt, like Poody Tang
I be high like an airplane
I be smokin and perkin, takin out anger and stress on the wrong person
Re-uppin and coppin turf an' then servin the soil block
Grittin tryin to put some gifts in my kid's Christmas stock'
Ooooh - pour out some liquor and shed a tear
For the homies that never made it and family that ain't here


So happy
(You know I'm happy to be here), you know I'm happy to be
(Said I'm so happy to be here yeah) said I'm happy, so happy just to be here
(To beeeeeee), to beeeeeee
(To beeeeeee), to beeeeeee
(To beeeeeee), to beeeeeee (I'm so happy)
(Oh I'm so happy)
I'm so happy to be, (to beeeeeeee-heeeeeeeeee)

Hustle,The Ball Street Journal,2008.0,"?
Hustle-MONEY!

I, I live and sleep on these streets
Cause I have got to get mine, my fam, see, we gotta eat
So when people ask me why, why don't ever I slow down?
Oh, I just simply reply, I don't really know how!
So I, hustle, hustle, hustle
(I'ma hustler, believe me)
You know I hustle, hustle, hustle
(And this ain't easy)
So I hustle, hustle, hustle
(I'ma hustler, believe me)
You know I hustle, hustle, hustle
(And this ain't easy)

Money and muscle
I gotta black belt in hustling
I'm doing my thang
Chain around my neck look like a playground swing!
Unit mover, pockets fat like Rasputia
Ask your chick, I got oil on my tongue
Pimp, I talk real slick, where the real ones go
They don't make them like me no more!
Hustler, I'ma whole 'nother animal
I'ma whole 'nother animal, I'ma whole 'nother beast
I can never switch up, I'm cut from the streets!
Papered up like a fax
I'm rare like white running backs
I'm getting my Gouda
I'ma be the first hustler to set up shop on Jupiter!


Let me introduce myself, homeboy
Any MC I will destroy
West, West, West Coast boy
Speakers in the trunk keep making noise!
I'm so fly, I'm that guy
28 inches sitting high
I'm a star, what you thought?
Everywhere I go, they snap shots!
Everywhere I go, they know Turf
Medallions jiggling off my shirt
C-notes keep falling out my jeans
Benjamin Frank, George Washing-teens
Gotta keep pushing, pushing weight
Filet mignon steak on my plate
Staring in my rear view can't slow down
If getting money is wrong, arrest me now!


They ask me, ""What you're doing bro?""
I say that I hustle everyday
My men don't sleep, we always up
Cause we can't live off minimum wage!
Middle finger to the other side
I know that I just want to get paid
When you hear this one go and turn it up
From Virgin Islands out to the Bay!",https://genius.com/E-40-hustle-lyrics
Fired Up,The D-Boy Diary: Book 1,2016.0,"The streets is my financial advisor
When I see other people havin’ their money, I get inspired
I’m far from a hater, that’s what I’m not
I’m a congratulator, tell ‘em ‘I see you’ and give ‘em props
From my savings in my socks on the block and flea-flickin’ rocks
Getting beat up by cops to buying mansions on mountaintops
No more going to the station getting fingerprinted
The only time I get fingerprinted now is when I close escrow
Still with the activation, still with the mannishness, blowin’ cannabis
Strains of that cookie blue fertilized in that bat boo-boo
That there guano or maybe them chicken droppings
Girl Scout cookie and gorilla glue crossing
Some can’t comprehend what I’m saying ‘cause they way out of touch
And they square as a box of Fruity Pebbles and Cocoa Puffs
Out the loop like a hula hoop, get they game from the ‘net
I get my game from the soil, the turf, the trenches, the set

Tool on me in the club, yeah, I’m plyered up
Talk shit, get hit, jaw wired up
Roll another ‘wood up, I ain’t high enough
Where the bottles at? We here tryna fire up
(We finna get this muthafucka fired up)
Fired up, fired up, fired up
(We finna get this muthafucka fired up)
Fired up, fired up, fired up
(We finna get this muthafucka fired up)

UH!
Verse two
I’mma make it do what it do
My nigga, I don’t know about you
But I’m about my business like a Jew
My diamonds be flexin’ and pokin’ out like a titty nipple
The way I be dressin’ is kinda fly for a bigger niggro
Too blessed to be stressin’, I reckon, life is a bitch
Plead the fifth, no confessin’ and I’m too thorough to snitch
Watchin’ Trapflix, rollin’ a spliff in the afternoon
On the couch in the living room with my lady on Blue Lagoon
I stay timin’, I’m a tycoon, like my vodka coming out soon
I ain’t lying, I never do, I’m a factor, you could be too
BIATCH!


Financials used to be ugly but now they gorgeous and lovely
When my paper was injured it made a speedy recovery
They say I’m short-tempered, I’ll shoot you right in your artery
I’m begging you, asking you not to try me or bother me
Earth is my turf and my soil, gravel or property
And these suckas and haters is hella bad for the economy
I go bad on these batches and I don’t do no apology
Razor-sharp like a cactus and I believe in astrology
Loyalty, not dishonesty, THC, I blow broccoli
I’m a fixture in the game, I’m tryin’ to build a monopoly
I want the money, fuck the fame, so break me off somethin’ properly
And you can find me getting high and drinking brew on the balcony

Professional henchmen with hella hot ones up under they belt

A gang of solid murder beefs up under they belt

That sold you that half-a-cake last week on the set""
You mean that swivel that synthetic dope
That ripped me, that shit that was wet? Yeah
Don't even look over there, act like we ain't trippin

Breakin the rules and regulations
Boy I tell you not stickin to the script
Will get that jacket put on yo' ass for life
What jacket? That snitch jacket:
That reliable source, that rat, that head, that mice
That's why we can't be talkin and bein all careless on these phones
I know technology now
Allows po'-po' to look inside walls and see inside homes

Is buy my little daughter a brand new pair of Jordans

To stay one step ahead of the law enforcement
Be sharp with yo' shit
Keep yo' business to yourself and don't get sloppy

Cause you done been already got rid of all the evidence
Tryin to get a BUCK -- a BUCK?
A soup pot, a blender and a measurin cup
In my section eight appartment COMPLEX
Pissy MATTRESS, and dirty CARPETS
""Nephew, did you get my message?""
Yeah I got yo' message; you told me to clean up behind myself
And scrape the residue up off the edges
""What else?"" Always look over my headrest and my rearview zone
Cause triflin be skanless and the skanless might try to follow me home
Never tell a motherfucker what time you gon' cop or come back through

But me? Imma give it to you straight
Mama and daddy divorced when I was eight
Walking on thin ice, hoping that it don't break
Now I'm over here on the Hillside of the V
Re-established ourselves, me and D...Shot, Sugar T and Mugzi
Thinkin how can we beat the streets, and get up on our feet?
Even though my wisdom tooth pulled out I still got my wisdom
Know when the bitch choose and when to spit my ism

For being solid in the streets and loyal to your crew

Cutting the grass no time to play with toys
Clowning in class me and my nigga Bubba
Try to make a little cash starting selling hubba's
When you ballin, when you shoot the ball shoot your best shot
When you fallin, and you finna get caught, snitch you better not
That's gravel rule number 1
If you ain't intending on using it, never pull a gun
The more I learn the more I lose my learn
Thinkin about growin back my perm
When I was skinny out there looking shady
I'll yistol whip you with my .380


Making monumental moves with monumental dudes
Far from a square I'm not a pack of Kools
Puffin on my Vape pen blowing grass
Residue from the hit, concentrated hash
Cross-examine that ho before you decide to stay with her
Use a rubber, or you gonna need a babysitter
This my advice to my little nigga
These bitches brains getting smaller but they ass getting bigger
I don't sign bubblegum rap in my boat (nope)
I listen to 40 cause he a voice of hope (yup)
Free all of my people in Acerd, getting them home

Quarterbackin,Breakin News,2003.0,"The definition of quarterbackin'
*Scratched*
The quarterback..

Tell the cops don't read into it
Them days of slangin' yay been finished, them days have been done ended
So far gone them days that I'm offended
Snitches can't speak my name till they get winded
Can't you tell there's been a switch made?
Now fellas decide that they wanna run and tell like in the fifth grade
But I'm too gone, young'n be clear
Even when you see me, I am not really there
And I ain't play fair wit' my eye on the enemy
Huggin' the block just me and my mini-me
Did it and lived it, grinded here
Cops fillin' wit' my projects find it yeah
Not only was I in the game, I was gifted in it
Served food to the fiends and we called 'em dinners
Put the raw wit' the fake out, mixed it in it
Can't explain the cat's hustle, guess it just was in
It's Malicious

If you got the turf crackin' and ya money's stackin', ya
Quarterbackin', Quarterbackin'
Leader of the squad and you're the team captain
Quaterbackin', Quarterbackin'
Gotta little change and ya drivin' a range
Quarterbackin', Quarterbackin'
If ya sound system bangs, and ya pushin' them thangs
Quarterbackin', Quarterbackin'

Might not know what I'm talkin' about
If you ain't never lived it, or seen it, or done it
Seen fiends vomit, green stuff I had to clean it up wit' Comet
Mean stuff, so many deaths my streets is haunted
Believe us, you shoulda seen us, like Wile E. Coyote, man super genius
Against all odds like Serena and Venus
I only had a couple jobs in my life, but not too many thought I was grown
Who woulda thought I'd sell my skill for a microphone
And be rappin' about it up in the song, slidin' on some chrome
It's long money I earn, I'm bald headed, but I used to have a lord Jesus perm
When my name was Earl before the rap game
Runnin' from secret squirrel, I had my own thang
Raised by wolves, hyenas, and barracudas, gorillas and bulls


I play the field like Vick, from endzone to endzone
Serve that ish like snowcones in the hood
Entrenched in the gutter, I was lost to the good
Cuz I make the gat stutta like a OG should
Mamas lookin, so mistookin'
Nights in the kitchen thought I'd never finish cookin'
Way before pay for this that I'm mouthin'
19 years young, upward of 80 thousand
Trust me young'n Pusha was never browsin' for nothin' section 8 housin'
I'm stompin' thru like King Kong claimin' his home, his jungle
Mumblers beware the hood hates singers
I connect, block the corner like Jenga, fall never, you seen 'em
Posted in your hood leanin' fiends like the Tower of Pisa
Damn he's good..


Now of course you know I ain't talkin' about sports
I'm talkin' about runnin some shit
I'm talkin' about orchestratin' and illustratin'
Glorifyin' ya paper route
Whether it serve it to, uh..
Gettin' out there hustlin', grittin' and grindin'
Doin' ya thug-thizzlemajiggadale
Quarterbackin' man, hustlin' main
Trust that main, yeah, in real life main
Some call it pitchin', some call it grindin'
We call it Quarterbackin'
Yeah, and I ain't talkin' about sports, trust that main..

She told me he hella weak, he hella soft
When it come to score then I'm a pro
She try to tell me a long time ago, she won't do no more
She said he was a hoe
I said ""I know and you gon' tell him when to go""

We can take the battery out the smoke detector
Put a  in the dough
Puff a little drough
Take the innocent out your purse, they can smell it next door
Dress casual, not like we going to the prom
I booked this room on

Do not disturb sign trynna get a piece of mine
Spill a little cutie-quality time
Good sex, got my name tatted on her chest
Do some freaky things, she can tell to her BFF

Undastandz Me,Revenue Retrievin’: Day Shift,2010.0,"My nigga I don't want no hands out I'ma get my shit regardless
My network in the relationship, game is flawless
Where I'ma stop, nobody knows, I'm all over the place with my flows
I've fucked around with the coca plant game for years but now I'm celibate
People always ask me 40 how you stay current and relevant
I'm cut from leather both of these cats is cut from polyester
I'm hard as a brick, most of these suckers soft, like feathers
Finnah knock me a chick, 10 or better, break her for her cheddar
I'ma keep it all the way hood, I've been living in my third childhood, lately
Smoking a lot of spinach lately, hanging out at the strip club lately
I use to give them niggas player prices and jugs for the bricks
But now I be giving them discounts for hooks and verse licks
I like bitches with cellulite
I dont like them too lean
I like them thick and yolked like UCLA softball team
I'm cool with either or fat or petite
Cause I ain't gon' lie, skinny pussy be deep
Bust open the package and throw the trojan out and smash it
Stretch the kiznoochie out just like elastic
I'ma give it to her slow like a snail or real fast like a rabbit
And in the bay area fly coonin' is a habit

You Undastandz Me
Understand Me
You Understandz Me (x4)

You got a zip?
I got a zip, you need a zip?
Yup!
You got a brick?
I got a brick, you need a brick?
Nope
That's what the little homey asked, when he was broke
Said he needed a credit line
I told that nigga ain't nobody giving out no lines
No numbers, no loans
Ain't nobody giving up zones, no chickens, no bones
Said his moms was about to lose her home, his sister on dialysis
Older brother didn't caught a body
His younger brother on Kaddafi
His daddy in for armed robbery, uncle in for grand larceny
His auntie in for bad checks; credit cards and money laundering
His cousin FISH, so he thinks he needs protection
Not only that, but his broad hollering pregnant
Quite as kept; she's been doing a lot of sexing
Getting it in, with the nigga best-friend
So I pushed him in the mix, with a month in a half, or 6 weeks or so
He moved up to 36
36 zips of bow equals a grip
We call it; Kicks, in the Bay
It's a fool, it's a trip, walk straight, they don't play, it ain't cool
BITCH!


I'm a street nigga, walk with my head up, stick out my chest
I don't like private jets, I fly south west
And you'll never catch me wearing a fucking wire
That's how you get your head deflated like a tire
I don't be gossiping, and running off into lip and name dropping
I be hustling in the traffic, repping shoulders and hold down
Getting gusty and galavaty, politicing and moon walking
Desert eagle, hold a slick caution, verified ficture from the V
Soil celebrity, heavy, so don't be fucking with me
I'm having my fanny born and ready ever since I came out the coochie
I was a nosey little mustache infactuated with cash
Tryna get some ass fast, finger fucking broads in class
I get dressed at the mall, brand new kicks and fits
'Where you be getting yo hats from?' Man I buy them from Lidz
I'm with the shit but I don't really sucker shit at all

Me and my niggas don't take no mess
You real niggas probably don't ever
Everybody gotta squeezer these days, rifles and SK's
Stuck in my stubborn ways, hella mannish with it
Magnums and 12gauge, do damage with it
Whoopin em at they own game, all the po-po know my name
My fame bigger than my bank, although I'm having change
You can find me at the shooting range perfecting and practicing my aim
Me and my young life, knuckleheads, Thunder Cats and hooligans
The only way to get out is to go in
So cover me I'm going in like Daniel in the Lion's Den
Roll with us or get rolled over man, crushed a swad a beer can
The only man I fear is in the mirror man

Trapped,Revenue Retrievin’: Graveyard Shift,2011.0,"They got me trapped, aye
Ooooh trapped like an animal
I just wanna get out
But they won't let me live my life
Ooooh...
Trapped like an animal
I just wanna get out
But they won't let me live my life

Uhh, my phone rang
You got a collect call from an inmate in a federal prison
I dang near cried
Too accept charges, press 5
Family did you get my wheeler, my kite, my letter
I put sumthin' on your commissary and shot you a little cheddar
Yeah I got it family right on for that look what I think
In the federal prison we can email now you should hit me up on CorrLinks
I'm thinking about writing a book I been keeping a little diary
Spending a lot of time in the jail house library
Exercising and eating right, burpees and push-ups at night
Conditioning my brain fast and try'na change my life
Remember the homie such and such he up in here too
He told me to tell you what's up brah he speak highly of you
He the one who be cuttin' my hair, he try'na go to barber shop
Stick to hisself neutral partna is a coon


I'm in here on some trucked up charges, but snitchin' not my style
They gave me mo time than a rapist and a pedofile
I'm reading the bible my celly reading the Qur'an
It's been a year since I last seen my mom
I'm in here programming foreal
Waiting for the laws to change next week I'm up in a appeal
But I know it ain't goin work
Nobody comes to visit; I ain't got no family support
But I got this one correction officer, she ain't got no fear
Anything you can get on the streets we can get it here
That's what she told me
So she snuck me in her cell phone put it up in her coochie
Uhh, I stay in trouble
Beat the nigga ass with a chair over a game of Pinochle
About a week or so ago
To them I'm just a number they ain't goin never let me go


They in the yard playing basketball hoopin'
While I'm talking to my OG potna, he proovin'
He up under that attic
Anybody fuck with me, he a split they wig back, uhh
He used to be a baller
On the streets he a fiend but in the pen he's a shot-caller
Security on the roof in the pear
Waiting for some shit to jump off live ammo and riot gear, uhh
Tomorrow a nigga birthday and you know
I got a big ole plastic bag of pruno
I'm finna get zooted
Drinking ain't good for you, but it's therapeutic
Man a little chest but under a whole lot of stress
Reason a 31-year-old granddaddy my grandson teethin'
I feel bad cause all I got is advice
And I ain't got nothing to show for it brah I'm in here for life


They got me trapped, they got me trapped, they got me trapped
Don't matter if you walk away they got'chu trapped
They got me trapped, they got me trapped, they got me trapped

Durrin a playa like my youth
I think I recall when I got my first tooth
I was a teethin little ol heathen perv off that philippe bombay juice
Some like a little further on down the line
Started fuckin with moonshine, all kind of wines
Stood in front of the liquor house soakin up gidname, from old timers
Buy me a drank man I know it's against the law im underage be a good sport
What you need my little comrade a packet of kool-aid and some whiteport
What else? A thing of beedies and a short neck of Night Train
Whatchu gonna give me? A crumpled up foodstamp that I won in a dice game
Preciate it playa, I'm up out of this bitch bout to go hook up
With my so-hid-nobs relatives simple ones kinfolks
Good folks, y'know, y'know
Twoasted, slerkin, me and my fools be out there back pervin
To' back on your face and start all over again

Let's perv, throw up, and drank again
Let's get high, loaded, and smoke again

Just wakin up from my hang-over
Still high, like I swallowed an ounce of yola
Hell yeah I don't wanna ever be sober
Like bein toishin, wake up in the same position, open up the safe
Peep the stash, lookin mighty healthy, plenty of cash
Grabbed my faulty from up out the charger
And then made a dash called up the folks today is the day

To make you lift this tick, fuckit nigga blow a bottle


Room spinnin, dead
Got the garbage can next to the bed
Now I was tweakin off that old crazy ass commercial on BET Jackie Stallone
What made it so bad is I don't even know how I got home

Shootouts, high speeds, on top of the roof and trees
On the side of the house with gauges, rifles and .223's
Back then it used to be pagers not WiFi and 4G
When I was seventeen me and my crew went half on a key
Now I'm making more in a day then my momma making a week
Jewelry, clothes, new shoes on my feet
Having my cabbage hella slap a lavish trunk full of throb
Woofers, tweeters and horns, doing they fuckin' job
Getting 'em up throwin' 'em, bobbing and weaving beastin'
Knuckling up with OGs in the middle of the street in
Earning my stripes and medal no bronze or silver just gold
Pea coats in the summer, even when it ain't cold

What's on my wrist? That’s a Rollie (A Rollie)
They tryna act like they know me (Know me)
Where was you at when a nigga was down? (Nowhere)
Way down (Ain't nobody show love)
Let me spit my point of view of this shit, man, you feel me?
Stayed down 'til I came up
Let me poke my spitter-ittery
Listen here though (Hello)

The washin’ machine wasn't workin' so I had to hand-wash my clothes (Clothes)
Magazine Street, I was observin' dope fiends powderin' they nose
I kept a razor blade and a safety pin and I rocked a bag of yowder (Yowder)
And a thumper that'll turn your cranium into New England clam chowder
There's not enough minutes in the hours, not enough seconds in a week (Week)
Gotta keep that iron on you, even if you creep
Didn't understand it ’til I was older, some of my people is bipolar (Polar)
Post-traumatic stress (Stress), levels can get vulgar
I’m a stand-up dude with a slave mentality, attitude from the avenue (Uh)
I'm thorough, not ignorant, I’m outspoken, but moves militant
I don't trust nobody, I'm sorry, I tried it once, never will again
Can't be game-goofy, can’t be no clown or a Gilligan
When my pants was full of lint and I was barely payin' my rent
Had a TracFone, not an iPhone, no AT&T or Sprint (Sprint)
Me and my baby mama didn't have it good (Where she worked at?)
I was in the streets, she worked at Planned Parenthood (Parenthood)

Ayy, where was you when I was doin' bad, movin' 'round sad?
Shout out to my old hoes tryna get back what we had
15 with a pistol, mama like, ""Where you found that?""
Boilin' water on the stove, takin' baths with a dirty rag
Couldn't get no rest at home, took a nap where he servin' at
Mama found that sack, now he live where he serve that crack
She kicked him out, so fuck it, he gon' sleep up in the trap
Now he got his own room, he ain't just takin' a nap
I swear people always reachin', when you need 'em, they ain't there
Used to people leavin' me in the cold, that ain't rare
They say they loyal, man, I swear that shit cap
If they get a chance, they'll take me off the map

Ay, what it was when we was dead broke?
Came from the projects, I ain't have no choice, we had less hope
Man, sippin' Hen and reminiscin' 'bout my dead folks
Don't play no games, Lil Joe on go when he see red smoke
He ridin' 'til the pegs broke
Me and Sho first jumped off the porch, we left the yard together
He get a mil', he split it with his brother, we used to starve together
All black, lay a nigga down, we used to rob together
Missin' Weed, I know he missin' me, you in my heart forever
Whoever thought that we'd blow in
Got to the finish line and turned around and let my bro in
They tried to lock me out, I held the door and stuck my toe in
They ain't wanna give me help, went by myself and kicked the door in
Ayy, real shit, we came a long way
I know they wanna eat off my plate, but this the wrong tray
I was just on trial for robbery, stressin' day for day
Now I'm with E-40, chillin', sippin' wine in The Bay

Come up, I come from nothin
To get it crankin right here
Right here?
Turma-turmoil, torment and turmoil
Uh ooh
We been in bondage for years
For how long?
Trapped up in the ghetto
Yea that's true
Dang, I got a dream though
Fiction
Tryin to make my own progress
That's fictionary

ZOOM!
Even though the streets mob filthy, lights burned out (out)
Dopefiends die with antennas in they mouth
Niggas are starvin, some of my niggas is havin they cash
Niggas is ballin, parkin they car, all on the grass
Livin it up to the fullest platinum colored jew-els and organized glass
Not none of that old fake ass costume jewelry, that looks like brass
I'm lookin out the window while you play Nintendo
You drive a Navigator, I drive a Pinto
I was there, nothin polite, me and my fools
The ghetto, field mice and rat drippings up in my shoes
A rebel, without a pause, commodes n stars
No toilet tissue, dirty doodoo stains up in my draws

Ooh zoom, I like, to fly far away from here
Where my mind flows on, it's fresh and clear
And I, found a love, that I long to see
And people, who be, who they want to beeee, ho!

I never had, lobster in my life (or what?)
Or teriyaki steaks, just sardines and spam and cornflakes
Pacific Bell done put me on restriction once again
I can't call out, but you can call in
Can barely think straight, barely keep focus
My crackhead cousin spent the night (what we got) now we got roaches
(Damn!) Here lies my property, no composure
Six months behind on my mortgage, house under fo'closure
Momma ain't feelin too good, she diabetic
Scared of needles hospitals ambulance paramedics
And I'm the oldest of fo', sleepin on the flo'
Watchin TV channels we used to borrow cable from next do'

Ooh zoom, I like, to fly far away from here
Where my mind flows on, it's fresh and clear
And I, found a love, that I long to see
And people, who be, who they want
Who they want to beeee, yea! HAHAHHHHHH!

I seen it in a dream, a big white home, looked like a office building
An old school Brougham with a sunroof ceiling
Thug living, sixty-four ounce of drinkin thinkin
""How could I come up, and purchase me a Lincoln?""
Drug dealin, leelin and dealin tryin to make a million
Blood spillin, driveby walk up to that nigga peel him
Back then I was blind, penetentiary chance at jail
Livin off my gahl for hella long she worked at Taco Bell
And if the heater ain't workin and it's freezin cold
We open up the oven and turn on the stove
Survival, granddaddy's appreciation revival church
Of pentacostal, we raised money by givin car washes

Ooh zoom, I like, to fly far away from here
Where my mind flows on, it's fresh and clear
And I, found a love, that I long to see

Gotta stand for somethin' or you gon’ fall for anything (Anything)
That's what I be tryna tell my offspring (Offspring)
Gotta hold 'em like a hiker on a cliff (On a cliff)
Take baby steps, you got a lifetime to get rich (Forever)
Makin’ the wrong decision'll get you put in prison (What else?)
Your girlfriend'll leave you when you get sentenced (Wow)
Now, your potnas is in her mentions
While you workin' the chow line up in the kitchen (In the kitchen)
Hittin' the gym, just live within the devious
The closest ones to you be the most envious (Jealous)
Vindictive and triflin', snakes in a coil
Not all the time, 'cause a lotta your potnas can be loyal (Real)
I felt that comment that came from the legend Boosie
""Rappers, move out your city 'fore you get killed in your city""
Money cause envy so you gotta protect your neck and your pumpkin
And when you successful, people think you owe ’em somethin’ (Preach)

Ain't nothin’ phony about my testimony

Ay, ain't with the cap and don't at me, get at me
If there's money there then I'm at it, I'm trappin'
Every night 'cause Peezy gotta make it happen, no lackin'
Stay packin', out there grindin' with a passion
Niggas died left and right but you won't see me in a casket
Plastic, new Glock, tucked it in my jacket
Ask me 'bout a murder, I'ma start laughin', hahahaha
Wanna know that money was the motive
This one right here for them soldiers trappin' on a Motorola
Mix it with the baking soda, push it like a baby stroller
Every young nigga can make it, you just gotta stay focused
Call it like I see it, I'ma tell it like it is
I'ma keep it gangsta as long as I live
Wanna know the real, all you gotta do is ask me
But if you wanna spread the word, don't at me

Shouldn't no parent have to bury they child deep underground (Unh-uh)
It should be the other way around (For real)
Sorrow and grief, senseless losses
'Posed to die of old age, we 'posed to die of natural causes (Tell 'em)
In most cases but that is not the case (Why?)
Not where we stay, not in this place (Unh-uh)
They play the game of death, they tryna score
Until they see their family and potna's brains on the floor
It's different than the way it used to be, it's sick
They look forward to goin' to jail, everybody totin' a stick (Everybody)
Especially out here in the smurkish, dirty Bay
Where they quick to throw it all away in one day, I wish somebody come and pray
It's easy to kill but it's harder to get used to it
I might know a couple of people that used to do it
After the second time, the third time was a cinch (What else?)
Once you're numb to it it's just like guttin' up a fish (Biatch!)

Ayee mama, I know the weedman! Weedman, he's my friend. 

The weedman, the cannibus pack, the vegetables, the lettuce man, the hydrogen laugh
The cure, the grass, the medicine, the farmers, the club, the growers and the citizens
The caters, the champ that amped um for the marching bands
You will wanna learn this dance, side to side from left to right like this wit yo hands
You one of my loyalest customers, you know I ain't gone get ya
Ima slide through there in a minute & Ima smoke somethin' witcha
This week I'm runnin' a special, I'm tryna have my doe, this week I'm lettin' um go for like 250 a O
Some of us sellin' pills, some of us sellin' blow
Some of us got meals, & some of us is poor
Thats why I'm lettin' um go for the low low, duckin' & ditchin' & dodgin' the po po
Gettin' um off for cheap, no boy, competitors can't compete, my prices is hard to beat
Affordable tryna stay on my feet, shippin' & handlin', gamblin' my turkey bags don't leak
Bieeetch!
Ayee mama, I know the weedman! Ayee mama, I know the weedman!
Ayee mama, I know the weedman! Weedman, hes my friend. 

On the hush hush, the majority of the time I don't really like to flamboast to much
Cause the jealous will drop a dime & try too tell on us
In my line of work not even your bestfriend ya trust, thas why I always pack a 9 in case I gotta bust
Speakin' of bust I think that rhymes with cannibus
Marijawana & I'm the provider who gotta lighter
Higher & higher, 
the new thing is a vaporizer
, the other day ago they had to rush my folks to kaiser
Cause his heart was skippin' a beat & it was off track, but really & truly my folks was havin' a panic attack
Everybody ain't built to reef, but some of us smoke from the time we wake up too the time we go to sleep
I'm on my way back from New Mexico on my 7th tank of petro
In my new school Lincoln Navi, 
with my decoy right behind me
Takin' the back roads, customers on hold, soon as I get in the city limits this sh't is good as sold
Bieeetch!
Ayee mama, I know the weedman! Ayee mama, I know the weedman!
Ayee mama, I know the weedman! Weedman, hes my friend. 

UGHH! 
I got that white widow, that sour diesel, them northern lights, that kush, that afghani
That champagne, that purple haze I push. Indoor, outdoor either or it don't matter
Smoking weed is therapuetic & healin', weed is a muscle relaxer. 
Its more right than wrong
, 
it helped me write this song
You might get the munchies & eat a muthafu'ka out they house & home
Alot of us smoke the hooka, alot of us smoke the bong, swisher sweets, backwoods, zig zags, or a cone
My harvest game is sick, my strains & my seeds, my potnah got a DUI for smoking too much weed
You can look me right in the eye & tell that I'm keyed
Cataracts, cannibus card, its hard too see & read

Off dat underwater weed keep smoking like a bad exhaust

You ain’t getting cash then your life’s a disaster
Keep your foot on the gas

Pull up in your jacks
And we will leave yo ass (wet)

Say she wanna have sex
Better yet she just gotta check
Then leave it up to me to collect
I’ma have her in deck
And she can’t even invest
And yes
I guess
It’s on to the next
Fit the crown on my sweats
Threw the chrome in the Lex

When Life Shows Up,The Gift of Gab,2018.0,"What kind of human beings are we really?
What has gone into the shaping and molding of who we are
Both as persons as well as communities and traditions?
The inescapability of traditions
For me the greatest tradition is spiritual fortitude in the modern world, which is the black musical tradition
There's never been a tradition on such intimate terms of catastrophe and still able to generate such unbelievable forms of creativity, compassion, and fortitude

When it was my aisle turn to get up and view the casket
Couldn't hold my tears back, it was automatic
When the reverend started preaching, it was sad
After the funeral, I hugged his mom and dad
Paid for the memorial, 7000 dollars cash
Only time we get together is when somebody pass
The story of many people I narrate
Hella hate divide and conquer, separate
When I was born, momma didn't feed any baby food to this infant
She fed me collard greens, dressing, candied yams, and fried chicken
In the trenches, we trippin', got trials and tribulations
Renovation, they forcing us out, gentrification
Living in the Bay, it's expensive, it's hard to bargain
2500 a month to rent a 1 bedroom apartment
Cancer don't care how old you are or who you are (no, no, no)
Live your life every day like it's no tomorrow (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Health can be your best friend or worst enemy, could be ruthless
Lou Gehrig's Disease, leukemia, and lupus
No Medi-Cal insurance so we self-medicate
Eat tomatoes 'cause it helps protect the prostate
Some of my potnas vegan, some just watch the way they eat
Substitute ground turkey for ground beef, no red meat
It's mainey outchea, it's murkish and it's sick
Everybody outchea carry and pack a pogo stick

Life for us it's just different 'round here (It's different)
Yeah, life is much different 'round here (Uh)
But we don't give up
In God we trust
When life shows up around here (Shows up)
Sometimes it's unfair around here (It's unfair)
But we still rise up (Uh)

Every day somebody fighting for they life
Every second it's a body put on ice
Maggots, flies, vultures, parasites
Tag on they toe without a price
In the middle of the slums rockin' crumbs
Secondhand smoke all in our lungs
Weikel's, Smart & Final, Target
You liable to find me up in Chavez Supermarket
The homie's kids and his nephews tryna rap
Say that's the only way to get up out the trap
Gettin' on somethin' they only content
I tell them they can be an astronaut or an accountant
Can't wait to get papered up with designer belt on my pants
Do the money dance with the money phone in my hand
Loved ones in a situation and need some cash?
Send it through Square Cash, they'll get it fast
When I finally catch a break, it's voodoo
Every time I catch a break, it fall through
Life is against me, the devil's on me
He shady, he janky, he ain't my homie
Temptation is vicious, you gotta watch all these bitches
They'll line you up with no clippers, do anything for they niggas
Life is an assignment, it's a test
Repent, thank God, and confess

Oh, life for us it's just different 'round here (
It's different

When life shows up around here (whoa)
Sometimes it's unfair around here (
It's unfair

But we still rise up (look here)
Life for us it's just different 'round here (
It's different

Yeah life is much different 'round here (it's so different round here)
But we don't give up (it's so different round here)
In God we trust
When life shows up around here (when life shows up)
Sometimes it's unfair around here (life shows up)

My name you're screamin', how I be hittin' them walls
You got me tinglin', how you be workin' them jaws
With a kiss that make a score shady, nowadays raw
I lash and cut, dash, we up
Beat case with a blast headin' straight for the nut
B.A. and H got some breezies all in the cut
It's that season, drop my number, told the ho ""hit me up""

Yo, yo, you're 9-1-1'ing me to death—what's all that for?
Got my Unisys bill and Pagenet pager on the overflow
What's happenin' with all that old bullshit?
Is it really all that damn serious?
You're draining the hell out of my battery
Got your partner thinkin' curious
'Cause in the Y-E-A A-R-E-A, the game ain't constipated
Fuckin' around in the Golden State where the game originated (Originated)
Fools be scandalicious, used-to-be-squares be turnin' vicious
Hit me on pager, hit me if it's major

If it's major, hit me on my pager
Rang it, ring it, rang it, ring it
Ring my telephone, ring my telephone
If it's major, hit me on my pager
Rang it, ring it, rang it, ring it
Ring my telephone, ring my telephone
If it's major, hit me on my pager
Rang it, ring it, rang it, ring it

Barbarian,Revenue Retrievin’: Graveyard Shift,2011.0,"""You're a barbarian, a savage""

I'm a barbarian, a savage, fully and semi automatic
A mannish hustler with the package, rock like Lenny Kravitz
On a mission about my mail, peddlin' chickens, Burney's and 12's
Rob a nigga if I have to, if all else fails
But that ain't really my get-down plus I know the laws of nature
It might not come back on me now but this will come back on me later
I'm from it, built for battle, the Bay made me a beast
Same Levis for weeks - 501's, no crease
I pack a cannon, .44 like Clint Eastwood you see
A cannon? Yeah but not the Canon camera 7D
I'm whiskey off this Landy
I don't know when I'll be sober again
I'm just now falling down from the sky
Finally coming down off my high
If it wasn't for the water the rap game would be dry
So I feed the soil life, resuscitate the game
Breathe life back into every real nigga that we lost, mane

Uh, he an animal, a beast
He don't eat, nigga he feast
Same jeans for weeks
Out here with the zombies, fiends and tweaks

Do the development while I might better tetch it don't wanna get caught loose
Some of these niggas act ill when they get on pills and courage juice
A lot of these dudes ain't real, lot of these cats are synthetic
Swervo, counterfeit, yeah nigga I said it
I just scribble on top of suckers up on my solid-dude list
I don't need no liabilities, I can't be taking no risks
Gotta say I found, go hard like them Marion Barbarians
When there's beef can't be no vegan or vegetarian
In the streets of Calif-harm-ia don’t let the palm trees mislead ya
Come out here with that tough guy attitude and we'll bleed you
Every time I look around I hear the streets blocked up
It's just like where you say send ya back in a pine box
I take my shirt off in this bitch, stretch marks and all
Turn into something, put my back against the wall
Get to jacking and punching until I break a nigga jaw
Keep swinging and swinging until my enemy fall
Biatch!

He an animal, a beast
He don't eat, nigga he feast
Same jeans for weeks
Out here with the zombies, fiends and tweaks

Mommy and daddy never home so we raised ourselves
No dental plan, medical insurance and health
So I'm out here with the zombies, dope fiends and tweaks
Bodies in the streets covered with sheets
Unlicensed drunk drivers, sex offenders in prides
Supposed to be saved folks, sinners and backsliders
It ain't for play, one thing about Los Angeles, San Diego and The Bay
We quick to throw it all away in one day
Over some he-say, she-say
Lock me up and throw the key away, give me L-I-F-E
Give a fuck, ""I'ma die out here"" became my mentality
Be a barbarian till I'm old and grey for eternity
Ghetto celebrity, hey, specializing in selling D
But right now it's a drought, so I'm selling tree
Zips, zaps, zubbles, peas for three
Thou-wow a pound, nigga holla at me
Biatch!

He an animal, a beast
He don't eat, nigga he feast
Same jeans for weeks
Out here with the zombies, fiends and tweaks",https://genius.com/E-40-barbarian-lyrics

Roller skatin on them thangs! Ridin federal
Super-flossin, full tank of petrol
Me and my Mossie, TRUMP CHANGE
Lucrative loot, long money, big bread
Step on my boots, next day, he was dead
Shit you not, all I gotta do
Is cough to have your motherfuckin head knocked off
""Nigga you my nigga if you don't get no damn money
Just remember no matter how much motherfuckin fetti you sittin on
You still a damn nigga""
Y'all know us meth merchants, sherm stick or pies
Y'all know us sea serpents, makin the grass, get full supplies
Little man complex, and if I ain't little
Then I'm big, and if I'm big then I got, big man complex
Love sex, took three of my botches welfare checks
Put a down payment on a brand new invisible diamond bezel
Oyster Perpetual Rolex
Bullet proof vest and armored like bricks
Sometimes you might find me drinkin tap water
Up out the public park sinks
But most of the time it's Louis the Thirteenth, sixteen
Hundred dollars a pop, guzzle sip sip guzzle non-stop
Mo' candy than c it's coca leaves, flamboast and brag
Go on shoppin sprees, and act bad
Never mind how much it cost, put it in the bag!
Bought a brand new Jag without, lookin at the price tag
Chorus
Fresh up out the box, bought a shit-load of guns
With my left-over cop money, pay cash all ones
Talk to me, I feed the dopefiends crumbs
It's monumental, when they let me use they rental
I'm a factor, livin life, with mo' cheese
Than the Green Bay Packers, pay off the vice
Ain't never went out Blackwards
I'm engaged to this dope game, no swivel
We talked about gettin out, but it's not official
When there's a drought we don't fret, we handle business
Nigga what you sweatin if you have scientizzic chemistes
That can make that shit and when they cook that shit
It's just like dinner
But cluckheads don't use forks and spoons
They use TV antennas
Chorus
BAR-NONE, sucked up to nathin, heavy rotation
If it wasn't for some of that ""Tired of Being Stepped On"" shit
When I was locked up, I probably wouldn't have never made it
Splurgin, overspendin, doin just a little bit too much
Puttin the ? on a new 40 if I could do it all over again
I'd do it just like
I was locked up on a Friday, went to court on a Tuesday
Third strike victim, judge tried to do me
Lookin at my folks on TV
""Nigga that's my nigga!"" In the day room
""VALLEJO NIGGA (watchin' BET) VALLEJO NIGGA!""
Sorry about your patnah, heard he took a fall
Up in here, we get the news before y'all
Now you know we ain't supposed to be talkin on this kind of phones
Dude why you jaw jackin
Well what's the new thing? White collared crime computer hackin
Ticket scalpin, and dang near e'rybody that I know

Piss poor, you know?
Catastrophic moments
They wanna know why I'm so seasoned, y'know
Welfare recipient - there's a reason why I'm seasoned

The projects.. and the beat down, renovated apartment complexes
Smell me!

Uh, you in a new school whip
Custom painted candy apricot butter
I'm in an antique old school four do'
Muffler draggin beat up duster
With scrapes and scratches, nicks and scars
Y'all get to drink out of wine glasses
We gotta drink out of jelly jars
Down and out like four flat tires no washing machine nor dryer
Just a pillowcase sack and a bunch of clothes wrapped
In a sheet on our way to the laundrymat
Will I ever get paid, can I make a dollar out of fifteen cents?
Y'alls got it made, we broke and starvin barely payin the rent
Sleepless nights, alligator t-uh-tears
Mommy arguin wit my daddy, daddy drunk too many beers
911 Mr. Po-Po, dey ain't happy wit day marriage
Pops tryna beat her down and make her have a miscarriage
My cousin shoots the needle, she be gone for days
She on that da-ah-diesel, she gone end up wit AIDS
I told her I love her I swear I just told her
But you know what she said to me?
Everybody got a gay or at least one dopefiend in they family
You ain't the only one wit a reject in yo' family
That's real

The reasoned the reasoned that we're seasoned
Seasoned and we, feel our paper won't disappear
Ohhh, hey it's been a long time in the bay
With God on our side we have somethin to say
And through the hard times we survive the game
Survive the game

If y'all smell onions - that's my arms potent
The reason I'm musty is cause, we ain't got no mo' deordorant
The laughin stock - patna, we ain't got no cash
Feet stinkin through my shoes in P.E. class
I'm thriznew with biznein briznoke; I'm about to hiznit the griznind
And if I get popped it ain't half no more it's 80% percent of my time
But that's ah cha-ah-chance, that I'mma have to-ah-take
Today my son birthday and I can't even buy a cake
I'm so damn through-a-through, I had a J.O.B
You want me to cut my perm, oh y'all gone ave to fire me
My fellow just got out da joint, thought he might be okay
But my fellow got out and got stapled 26 times the same damn day
Who wanna get dunked on? In the the flatlands it ain't never too late
Patna all we need is a piece of plywood and a milk carton crate
What about dat shopping basket, you know I'm smart
We can gone take the wheels off that and ma-a-make a go cart
Yo peoples blessed you, I started from a quarter ounce
You came in the dope game wit a silver spoon up in yo' mouth
Why we gotta gamble maine we hurtin, you got all the bucks
In the ghetto we play dominoes for push ups


You dig? You know
My people just tryin to make a way out of nowhere, you dig?
You know, the trials and tribulations, you dig?
It's hard times out here y'know
Y'know we just tryin to do our thing..
I remember when I was just a young boy
Growin up things was real hard for me
No food on the table, no clothes on my back

""40, get your ass up, time to hit the grind
You can't afford to pass no money I know you heard about that""
What, what? ""Task raided Millersville Ms. Miller had a heart attack""
Dude, that's some cold shit, ain't it huh?

V-Town, California where I was born, raised and grown
And since 1979 I been a hustler on the go
You know the drill, my mission for real, a mealticket
You feel, we slowly but surely approachin seven digits
Figurines, sticky doo-hicky and angel dust
Mescaline, niggas know better than fuck with us
I'm pimped out flossin in Reno in the casino
Big bid, fuckin off feddie I could've put down on a crib
I does that, I do, rejuvenate, redeem
Take a lose, take a lose
Don't make a scene
Nigga charge it to the triple beam
Fuck the stress
I let that orange box of baking soda do the rest
Holler at my neighborhood chef, Raul
Known for cloning chickens and turning one into two
That's all he do for a living
That's all he's used to
Playtex rubber dishwashing gloves and residue, Biotch!!!!

What if I bring this back down?
You gots to be about it or be without it

Be about it or without it
Ay, you know what? I smell you on that playboy, look
We fin to run down a a whole tac on these bitch ass niggas
Niggas ain't smellin this shit
We do this shit
Last night I slapped a bitch upside her dome
With my faulty phone
That heifer's tired
She tried to slash my tire
Caught me in the bed with her cousin Tanji
From the track
She use to hold my sack
I use to dick her down way back in 86
She use to look just like a skank
But now that bitch got a ass, tits, body and boy that bich is bad
For what it's worth, the pussy smelled like Certs
Victoria's Secret
Now folks just remember I never said I thought about lickin pussy
I said I never thought about eatin
Keepin it and treatin it nice
Fuck that I'm a hog
I put it down, I'm from the hood
Where I live, on the outskirts
And down on the tuck in the cut
In Clemente Apartments man
I'm a baller so you know I ain't got shit in my name
I'm strictly ghetto celebrity, niggas get buried
Ready for combat if you plottin and plannin
Oh if you come for me and confiscate my dough
Let the buzzer be the bail
But my suggestion is to stay within your envelope
I'm block to block, swingin on vines
Community service, put up stop signs

Uhhh!!! Hold the fuck on!!
Did you or did you not tell these niggas to stay within they envelope?
Sheeit, these toddlers are green to the game
They ain't know nothin about these tramps
Six bedroom flats and gettin dealt and held a hand across the mat
You see we from the Yay where we control they minds
And put these hoes on the grind

Ain't got to but I still touch it
Went to the Seven Eleven picked up a traders book and bought a bucket
Use to have a perm taller than the Charlotte Hornets
But I had to cut that bitch off cause see your patna had warrant
That I ain't even handled yet although I'm havin cake
The little homie from the hood want me to put out his tape
He kinda tight too, remind me of The Click crew
Cause they was spittin that old high powered
Godzilla ballin guru ass type shit you
Can relate to, wake to, 'scape to when it's sunny
Ride by, slide by, get at a honey
I know these streets like I know my dick
I can tell you who the nigga is that's about to get jacked
And the nigga that pulled the lick
I got this bitch on lock
999,999 plus a dollar in a safe deposit box
Marijuana crops still in this roster
Kilogram, coca leaf and morphien
What about my niggas in the 4-1-5
Look what they made
My niggas in the city
They call it made
Top grade regeneration, uncut
Designer weed, straight hempilation, what the fuck
Sheit, sheit, sheit, sheit, sheit, sheit sheit, sheit...

A young factor having scrilly, spending blue notes in a drought
Living for the moment, fuck further out
Tomahawk by my kidney, MCM belt
Fucker want beef, I'm make him a patty melt
I'ma see you about something, send my crash dummy
He ain't from Japan, but he like to play kamikaze
Your bitch got sloppy toppy, off of the ginger ale with Jack
She got that hot throat with a built-in thermostat
I'm smoking agricultural and vegetation in the backseat zone and blazin'
In the clean 19 with the dealership plates, insurance and registration
Garnished and decorated with all the toppings and all the fixings
We don't fuck with turf dirt, we only fuck with vixens

Beat the odds, count my blessings, it's a blessing
Praise God for replying to my message
Suckers don't understand me 'cause they ain't got no understanding
I'm out here feasting, I ain't famine, eating jasmine rice and salmon

My bitch got my back whether I'm wrong or I'm right
I'm a gangsta and all that ol manish shit i go zany and bad
A lightway part time comedian she like when I make her laugh
The other day we was just kickin it at powwowing and shit
Have a breakfast at the waffle house, cheese eggs and grits
Then all of a sudden come rushing some ol' mysterious bitch
Talking and hooping and hollering bout she pregnant and shit
I reached back as far as I can go I can get
Then I slapped the shit out that hoe with the back of my fist


Seems like everytime a nigga get home (get home)
A nigga done did sumthin wrong (sumthin wrong)
Caught me sex texting on the smart phone (smart phone)
I'm like ""what the fuck is this bitch on? "" (bitch on)
Her parents don't really like me cause they know we be on that thug love
And they don't get off in our business cause cum is thicker than blood
But her brothers be try'na to test me size me up and mean mug
But they know that I pack that iron and I'm good with the gloves
For the most part we cool and I respects they gangsta
I gotta baby by they sister we family I ain't no stranger
Me and my bitch got one of them love/hate relationships we some fools
Break up to make up then fuck cussing arguing infused
She don't wanna see me with her and I don't wanna she her with you
But the problem with me and her is all we do is accuse
But at the end of the fuckin day, I'm her man not her mouse
She got mo money than me, but I wear the pants in this house (BIATCH!)


Can't live with em, can't live without em
We put our trust in, but we still doubt em
Me and my, me and my, me and, me and my bitch
Me and my, me and my, me and, me and my bitch
I love her panties my nigga she love my dirty draws

Out there funkin' for nothin', for senseless reasons
Nowadays they stealin' and robbin', bippin' and flockin'

Prepare for the drama, and I stay noided and spooked

Waitin' for my plug to show up for three days during a drought (Wow)

Soaked up game, like a sponge

No streetlights or sirens, in the land of the opportunity

Tycoons and golf carts
Came a long way from grinding up on the block
Life savings all in my socks

I could have some niggas run up in your bando
My muscle car souped up and I ain’t talkin’ ‘bout Campbell
I’m thinkin’ ‘bout buying a Bentley truck and a lambo
I dress like a king and I’m out here living a dream
If you put your mind to it you could do anything


Tryin' to put something together, having my gouda and my cheddar
Foldin’ it backward like an omelet, ‘bout to get higher than I can measure
Got that plug like a Tesla, your bitch, you might wanna check her
She slick and she freaky sneaky, she want me up in her kidney
She want me to suck her titty, she wanna sit on my lap
Your bitch doin’ too fuckin’ much, I ain’t fuckin’ with none of that
I’m too busy, I’m in a rush, in the traffic checking my traps
On my way to the studio, laughin’, rappin’, making slaps
Only saps I fuck with is the SAP Center
Where the Sharks swim, surrender
Don’t test us, we got a short temper
Fuck around and chop you down like timber

I Love My Momma,Revenue Retrievin’: Overtime Shift,2011.0,"My mama man, she does errythang
She's a superhero

Nobody like you, there's nobody else
That I place above you
That's why I dedicate this song to you
I love you mama!

3 boys, 1 girl, no chumps
I was the oldest, she carried me for 9 months
Made her way out of no way with little money
But somehow some-way we had clothes for Easter Sunday
You always gave us our freedom, you never sheltered us
That's why we hard to this day, ain't no punk in us
Worked 3 jobs all through the weekdays
But still managed to make it out to my baseball games
We didn't have much, but we was grateful
Had a roof over our head and food on the table
And to make ends meet and pay some bills
We'd swallow our pride and have an old-school rummage sale
If I talked back and got loud
You'd say ""boy I brought you into this world
And I'll take your ass out!""
It's a trip how history repeats itself, for real
And the things you said to me now, I say that to my children


You suppose to love your mama, even if she gave you away
You could be gone tomorrow, but you're here today
Every night before I go to bed I pray
And ask the Lord to put the blood of Jesus
Around my familay. The less-fortunate, the underprivileged
Urban life, inner-city, single parent living
Every Thanksgiving, you'd make our favorite dish: chitlins
Macaroni and cheese, mustard greens, turkey and dressing
And as far as sweets, can't nobody touch you
When you'd make your famous banana nut bread and 7-Up cake
I'm so happy mama, you learned how to text
It tears me up inside when I don't visit
Cache Creek Casino, Mother's Day I put you on the bus
To go play Bingo. Talk about my mama, man?
Probably shouldn't do that!
My Mama good people give you the shirt off her back


My mama hip! My mama ain't no sap
My mama listen to Al Green and she listen to rap
When I was fonkin' with my own hood drama
She would jump in and tell them go get they mama
True story. Real talk. You know your mama gon' have your back
Even if you yell foul?
I'm just dwelling of the past
If I didn't fight back, then my mama would beat my ass!
So I'd rather see you than her
Tears down my face, putting tips on you bro
Bar none, taught me to be hard
My god-sisteer Donna and her brother Bernard
It's different from now, but back then
We'd fight our best friends, next day they'd be back friends
It's a trip how history repeats itself, for real
And the things you said to me now, I say that to my children",https://genius.com/E-40-i-love-my-momma-lyrics

When ’m in a virtual meeting, I sit on the board
I’m havin’ my capital, venture capital
I ain’t local, I’m global, ho, international

I do what I wanna do, smoke what I wanna smoke
Practice social distancin’, I don’t really fuck with folks
Thought the boy was solid, he pillow-talkin’ sucka stroke
Bonkers over baby, everybody and they mama know
I was playin’ dominoes and it was on me
Yeah, 40 had that rocket on him, .223

Stunning, the opposite of ugly
Run up in her bare like I don’t care
Without a helmet, rugby
Everywhere like, yeah, you liable to see me in Santa Clara
On the highway with my bros on my way to Santana Row
In San Jose, they don’t play like all the cities up in the Bay
Up in the Valley, they’ll melt you just like my folks from the Delta

Nine times outta ten, she’ll be probably right

I be sliding around here bossin’, having cheddar
I need a money counter to count my scrilla scratch
His money two-faced, it talks behind his back
This what I told the young tender (What you tell her?)
What’s wrong with that nigga?
Look at these thousand-dollar jeans, look at these $500 shoes
Look at these diamonds in my rings, look at these carats in my jewels
I’m mannish, respected, ain’t no debate
I’m early, I’m woke, I ain’t late
I need a real one on my team, she need a real one on hers

The Grit Don’t Quit,The D-Boy Diary: Book 1,2016.0,"Everyday is a weekend and every weekend is a day
In the mornin' before I go to bed, I get on my knees and pray
Thankin' Him for my life, faith and my strength
'Fore I die, give me time to repent
I'm tryna get out this life, I want the best for my family
The way I used to hustle, won a couple hood Grammies
I stayed up out of the way and made a way from nowhere
I used to whip that weight as white as Colgate
40 why you ain't sippin' that Rossi no more, you in they shadows?
Shit, I looked up to them dudes, shout out to Gallo
Used to ride by slurrercane, now I'm the owner
Black man, hill side, California

The grit don't quit, it don't quit
The grit don't quit, the grit don't quit motherfucker
The grit don't quit, it don't quit man
The grit don't quit, the grit don't quit motherfucker

Takin' pictures without the paint, doin' what haters ain't
Drinkin' all of my drink, clockin' in this bank
I'm serious 'bout money like the shark tank
Your money is funny like a grenade
I slept on the rug, wish I had a couch
But now I get love from the north, east and south
I got people who used to say they never care for my music
But now they fuck with me, what I talk 'bout, they been through it
I rap like everybody else and I'm low key, I don't flaunt
If I wanted to, I could buy a Bentley every month
Niggas be overdoin' it with their gudda
Every time I turn on the computer
Steady yourself, be careful who you rockin' with
Might be funky mane, might be hair in it
Always look over your shoulder and your clavicle

The grit don't quit, the grit don't quit motherfucker
The grit don't quit, it don't quit man
The grit don't quit, the grit don't quit motherfucker

Comin' up out the sewer, where it's shitty like manure
Now I'm best friends with the dealers and the jewelers
Chains on my neck feelin' like the Rick Ruler
I'm in it for respect, don't let this rap shit do ya
Ain't no funny about my money, I let the iron mean madula
Big ass gun look like a 12 inch ruler
It's the fero for DiNero, had my lil nigga do ya
I'm a scallop for that dollar, let a real nigga school ya
He got it all outchea and left you stranded
I ain't lookin' like a orphan kid who need a daddy
Baby I can get you up and make you hella happy
All you gotta do is throw that cheddar at me

The Mail Man,The Mail Man,1993.0,"Kick this shit about the mail man

Time for the payback, backpay
Can't let homie live to see his birthday
A.K., 47 hot ones to the kidney
Bootsee muthafucka didn't know what hit him
Went way, rode up on his ass in a Chevy
Baby, nigga shoulda known that shit was heavy
Dummy, shouldn't have fucked off all my fuckin' fetti
That I gave him, spent my shit with a nigga from another city
Then they doubled, tripled and sold his ass some swivle
Little old sucker-butt nigga trust the mail man
Now his ass is trash like a garbage can
Caught up in some shit with the mailman
The Mailman

My strap went boom
(Boom-boom!) now they gloom
My strap went boom
(Boom-boom!) now they gloom
My strap went boom
Had him duckin' every muthafuckin' thing up in the room

They say the youngsters run the penitentiary (I think they do)
They say the youngsters doin shit that you wouldn't believe
They say the youngsters on the street snort hop like a muthafucka
(Hm-hm) Well, check this part out, brother
(Okay) The nigga that the mail man shot
Little homie went to fetch himself a brand-new Glock
(That's right) Wired off that hop, premeditated plot
I'll park around the corner and do a walk-by
Reconciliation, retaliation on my mind
Nothin' against the Muslims, but I was raised eatin' swine
Trapped in the gidname since 1979
My niggas on the street taught me to perk and drink wine
I'm young, full of cum, nuttin' to lose
Paid my dues, I'm settin' the rules
I got some clues, and I refuse
To let the sucker that killed my homie get away smooth

(Boom-boom!) now they gloom
My strap went boom
(Boom-boom!) now they gloom
My strap went boom
(Boom-boom!) now they gloom
My strap went boom
When I see the mail man, then his ass is doomed

Thinkin, tweakin, sniffin, hoppin', plottin'
Schemin, actin like a demon
My pores is stinkin' and I'm all sweaty
Hallucinatin', smellin' like burnt spaghetti
Oh no, the mail man gotta go
He killed my homie but he forgot that it was one mo', to go
So I figured that he's after me
'Til the word on the streets is that I'm after him, true
Now I'm waitin' for departure
'Cause I'm never late on arrival
Grabbed the landmines, bazookas, grenades, and Tommy
Oh, and I can't forget the Glock 'cause it's the most reliable
Shit, fuck it, I'ma just take the Glock deep
I scoped out his spot, I know where he sleeps
Hot-wired the Thunderbird
I'm headed for the suburbs
Mobbin', doin' about a buck fifty
Took the third exit to another part of the city
Now I'm his presence, about to let him have it
Caught him walkin' to his car, and now he's in a casket

(Boom-boom!) now they gloom

(Boom-boom!) now they gloom
My strap went boom

Mail means money, man
F-l-a-m-b-o-y-a-n-t in this muthafucka
Mmm-hmm, the mail man
Ass-out jungle
Gotta watch your back and play it well
Stay away from faulty muthafuckas
That's real

I'm the guy he talkin' about when he say, he know a guy
Sellin' that there Qaddafi, that eleven five
The jump out boys can't stop me; they don't know how I look
I don't touch nothing, rubber gloves when I cook
Listening to the scanner in the trap
Not from Radio Shack but an iPhone app
Turnin' my money over and gettin' it like I'm 'posed to
My boxers is my holster I'll shoot you in the neck
Where a bullet-proof can't protect
Good chance if I pull it
'Cause I got armor piercing bullets
Flipping houses and buying property in my white boy name
You got a lot of shit to lose, I got a lot to gain
My uncle saved a sister life when they was in the Jone
Somebody tried to stab her with a turkey bone
He know I want out the game, he know I'm trying to get Ghost
He know I don't want the fame; I don't rap, I don't play sports
(none of it)

Where'd you get it?
I know a guy

He don't wear a suit and tie
But he tied into some guys that be wearing those suits and ties
He plug like a bachelor with the connect; with the supplies
He thug but come off like a square, but nigga he a rydah
He an old dude, with an old soul and a young thought
Hood famous for cooking dope in industrial pots
Ain't trippin' on the line, like that ain't what he 'bout
He done got it
You renting from the nigga that own that house
A dope crew mixed with some of that new mulla
Tucked off in the suburbs
Soccer moms and cougars
Him and his lady mainy with the ignorance
Open you up if you tried to hop the fence
S Corporations and LOC's
Properties, businesses, entities
Donations, fundraisers, celebrities
Put some bread on the head of a enemy ...beeatch

Where'd you get it?
I know a guy
I'm that guy x4

I see everything; I eat a whole lotta carrots
I don't repeat what I heard, like a motherfucking parrot
I might look like a nerd but I'll embarrass you
Stomp you out
I'll step on you with Giuseppe shoe
Papered up like a shredder
Got tools, no Black & Decker
Bitches be all the time, be on my line
I tell her I'm old
They tell me I'm in my prime
This world is cold, it's smirkish and ferocious
A lot of these people snakes or either roaches
It's too many players and not enough coaches
Some of these suckers don't even know what a coach is

Im cryin vengeance for revenge look what I do
Called up my Mossie told my niggas to be on alert
Heard it was some player hating O.G's out there putting in work
From what I understand that shit ain't over no turfs and drugs
It's over some bitches and some jealous niggas with a grudge
Hot at the head I'm fired up I wanna do'em in myself
Hit me up in the corner and watch me let them have it nelf
Money talks and bullshit walks, I'm off to San Leandro
For some Glocks and techno chops and a gang of ammo
Took a hit of the chronic dank to expand my thoughts relax nerves
When I get back to the town just think them niggas gonna get straight served
And a ballerish nigga like me young in the game straight having thangs
Taking this shit from some ol' jealous ass OG's man?
I'm not having it, you want some funk I'll bring it to ya
Dagnamit I thought you suckas already knew ah
Yes indeed, them niggas act like they can't bleed
But them lies, I'm talking about the element of surprise
Bring the noise, whos fallin like the big boys?
Heavens to Merkatroid, I'm ballin like the big boys
I just got the word I heard the same niggas robbed my partner herb
Pulled on his dick with a pair of appliers got him for a bird
It's gettin stanky got my curiosity arousin
See herbs a factor, he's worth $700,000
GTE mobile net cellular comminication
I got his voice mail number let me try an page him
I'm hecka cool he hecksa cool with me
He called me back said ""Lets go party on them fools E.""
I said ""Where you at?""
He said ""Where you at?"" I said I'm in Vallejo
He said I tell you what lets hook up me and you at Dennys in the Vill'
I said Roger he said ""Over and out don't fake out""
I said what time he said one o'clock if it's traffic go the back route
Ya see, sloppy jobs ain't my forte so no mistakes
We do it right and when it's done bring the yellow tape

Thats me an Herb talking outside of Denny's smoking a beedie sittin in my Cutlass
It's only a handful of them suck L's I can count them on my finger
Fuck letting this shit die down I'm ready to hear the fat singers
I'm bout my gats but can't make cash with niggas breathing all down my back
Therefore I must explore by taking a few lives to even the score
My ace Boon, my sugar low, blood pressure high
Drinking and crying two four seven my stomach in and out
I know this one botch that got my nigga that just got out of jail's baby
She'll play hop scratch she works for Pacific Bell and she just might maybe
Help me pull these niggas coat tails true ???

Finally got me a chance to use my Heckler & Knoch collection throw-aways
And when we did I guess you could say we did that
And after that niggas gave me my 'spec

Blessed By the Game,The D-Boy Diary: Book 1,2016.0,"It’s a game of cat-and-mouse in the Bay
Everybody know where everybody stay
Somebody didn’t make it to the house
Somebody got shot in they mouth
Gotta keep you a thumper, on the tuck, on the under
Can’t be shinin’ too flossy, they’ll turn you into a body
Can’t be stuntin’ too often, they’ll turn your car to a coffin
Have you coughin’ up blood while you was smokin’ your bud
And sippin’ your barre, or should I say lean
Him and his hoe, now it’s a crime scene
I’m a master of reality
Rap about good times and casualties…UH!

From the bottom, and I ain’t ever changed
From broke to having my change, mayne
Get up and get it, don’t always place blame
I’ve been blessed by the game

This morning, the Lord tapped on my head
Said ‘If it wasn’t for me, you would be dead’
Got up out my bed, got on my knees and thanked Him
I was hecka scared, it was cloudy and rainy
When it come to communication, you gotta be smart
Put your pride to the side and have a heart-to-heart
With your family and folks, your friends and your foes
Life can be short or taller than a stripper pole
I’mma get my shit together, bruh, I promise, I betcha
I’m slappin’ E-40, don’t shoot the messenger
Pack a Mac or a 40 just in case they test ya
Watch out for the Porky, pigs, they arrest ya
Some crooked, corrupted, attitude like ‘fuck it’
Some do they job and care about the public
I’m a master of reality
Rap about good times and casualties…BIATCH!


Techniques and tactics, mammoth mathematics
Runnin’ through paper like it’s a laxative
Since I toddler valued a dollar, ya hear me?
I’m the same the dude, I ain’t an impostor, ya feel me?
When you get on your feet, don’t forget your peeps
‘Cause they the ones that hold a nigga down in the streets
When it’s all said and done my testimony ain’t gon’ be phony
Sometimes I lose count on how many people owe me money
Forget about it, hustla, just love ‘em and keep it pushin’
Never know when you gon’ need a brother, we hoodlum
Boss, not a sucker, I love my loved ones, we folks
My bloods and my cousins grew up together, so dope",https://genius.com/E-40-blessed-by-the-game-lyrics
Home Again,"The Block Brochure: Welcome To the Soil, Pt. 4, 5, & 6",2013.0,"I’ve been waiting for the day (waiting for the day)
That i’d be going home again (going home)
I’ve been away from family way too long
But I know I’ll soon be home again

Ugh, life ain't promised tomorrow that’s what they say
Look what i say life ain't promised today
A lot of folks outta work right now, latin, white and black
So we count on obama care and america’s job welfare
Where i’m from is ugly not pretty it’s all bad it ain't good
The pizza man don’t even wanna come to my hood
Robberies crime scenes being seeing it often
And the most lucrative business is selling coffins
Society is two faced to a lot of folks that was well off then fell on hard times
The sign of the times family fallin out with family a whole lot of mess
I wish we had more positive speakers like dr. Cornell west
My niece wanna be a cosmetologist, my nephew a chef
But without a scholarship, a student loan will put them both in debt
Now that’s a catch 23 man that’s not a catch 22 caz I’d be damned if I don’t and damn if I do
My relative just got out the state but now he headed to the feds
On some trumped up charges that he didn’t did
But as soon as he come home we goin make a prison spread
Got some ramen noodles, some mayonnaise and tuna, some cheese and potato chips


Everytime I  leave the house i pray that i make it back
It’s easier to kill a man but it’s harder to live with that
It’s bad outta here in this trap  try’na make it in rap
Swimming in this concrete lake where the 2 legged snakes is at
We quick to kill our own killin, all wanna scrap and fight
The slave masters did want us to learn how to read and write
My minority is not the authority, priority
In the correctional institutions we make up the majority
Hot ones echo through the ghetto bullets ricocheted
The batteram and the canines and the task raids
It’s been 3 weeks and a half and she still ain't bathed
Turning tricks for rocks dippin top in alleyways
Used to be finer than wood face, body and butt
The baddest broad at the school now she sucked out
A good girl gone bad used to be squared as a town
Y’all had everything spoiled rotten we nothin in our christmas stockings
I keep my enemies close so i can see what they plotting
Some of my family gone but they not forgotten


The devil working over time but he can’t defeat me
Every night i say my prayer for some reason i get sleepy
Is there a heaven for a hussler, a d boy, a pusher
Try’na provide for his family, brothers and sistas
All i got is my word and my name
A good reputation is better than fame
What if things don’t shape up that what i say to the preacher
He said you gotta have faith you gotta be a believer
Don’t wanna be a employee i wanna be a employer
Everytime i get some money it go to my lawyer
I’m on the phone with my aunty she my prayer waiver
Giving me scriptures to read to protect me from the destroyer
This is my letter to god i hope that he reads this
Please cover me with the blood of your son jesus
The clouds is dark, rain, lightening and thunder
When the saints come marching in i wanna be in that number


Oooh it’s been so long
Been so long
And i’m on my way home
On my way home
Back to my family
To my family
It’s been too long
It’s been a long time
It’s been so long
So much pain
But i’m on my way home
Hardship, struggle, the struggle man growing up in the inner city
It’s been so long
Life is heavy, life is heavy y’all
But i’m on my way home
Gotta stay prayed up
Back to my family
Keepin praying man
It’s been so long
God is good
Been so long
Keep the faith man
But I’m on my way home
The ups and downs man
The torment and turmoil my nigga
The torment stay strong my nigga stay strong
Stay strong my brothas, stay strong",https://genius.com/E-40-home-again-lyrics

Tryna take me something home and have some relation

What you holdin'? Girl you a banger!
You ain't off the back porch, you're off the Hanger!

You a ten piece, shawty you a dime
Back that thang up, baby press rewind

I'm just tryna know you, hold a conversation
Spoil you a lil', lightweight cupcakin'
Spend a lil gouda, get your hair done up
I'mma show you how a tycoon wake that thang up


Don't stop get it get it
Bout' to jump up all in it

It's another one of them droughts, my sahob, and this shit costs us like fuck
Niggas takin' losses that they can't make up
Gettin' gaffled for some of that shit call cake up
Stretchin' the crack, makin' a bad batch
The screen from a tweaker's pipe turns black!
So they go crazy, get hot-headed, start actin' a fool, yellin'
But you all know it ain't no refunds in this shit that I'm sellin'!
'Cause during the drought season, niggas be lookin' for a reason to rush ya
So I suggest you put up your bootsies, man, and pull out your buckets

Here's another part of this shit that a nigga needs to uplift about the game
The drought season, mayne, 'cause this shit here never remains the same
And a brother ain't about to let his muthafuckin' capital go lame
So instead he's gots to get scandalous
'Cause he can't keep up and handle his business
Like he used to, and he ain't with really being through
Gets outta school and a kid gotta make a smooth come-up lick
Catchin' muthafuckas outta bounds, swerve
Breakin' they punk ass, leave 'em slurred
This is the type of shit that occur
So don't get caught loose on turf

I gots meals, wheels, and about five thousand dollars worth of bills
Bank account way in the red, fuckin' with the highest overhead
Jackin' off my money, yo' ass is out, boy, and I promise you that
I'm a money hungry muthafucka and I'm so serious about my scratch
So your best bet is to check yourself before you wreck yourself, punk bootch
I gets down and dirty like Dr. Ruth, and I put that on the Gooch
Droppin' muthafuckas just like a bad habit, dag-nab-it
Tricks wanna get outta line I let 'em have it, now bag it
I got ice cream, candy and all kinds of things of that flavor
And maybe later I might be willin' to go low as long as you a buyer before
'Cause I'm the only muthafucka' with A-1 yola
None of that ol' cake up with bakin' soda
It gets released, ceased, and then the prices rises like yeast
Those who got leftovers will become obese
Triplin' my mail off the triple beam scale
I even got enemies with envy askin' me for yayo

But in the drought season it's hard to get by
Niggas be runnin' off with D gafflin' muthafuckas, startin' at chances
'Cause a nigga's mail ain't too muthafuckin' fancy
Rollin' around in a deuce-and-a-quarter
Can't get caught loose on the border
Sittin' on them thangs like 40 would say
Fuckin' with a bitch's brain

Can't be affected by the Great Depression
This country is in a recession, I reckon
So let me give yo ass a funkin' lesson
Never let a muthafucka know what you got or what you buyin'
It's them bootsie muthafuckas in your town that's always dyin'
Stay low, play the background, keep your shit on a hush, mate
Hit it hard one time and then hibernate

Now check game, I'm tryin' to do my own muthafuckin' thang
But shit just ain't right
The heaters done got way too tight
Jackin' muthafucka's on sight
But I'm a nigga that don't give a fuck
When I'm tryin to get my cash flow up
In one of them there seasons whatever the reason may be

For sale signs on a nigga's shit

Back at it, never left, straight A with it, no F
Blowin' killin', I'm stressed, get it then make a mess
Then clean them jeans, make her knock, fiend (oh yeah-yeah)
Walk in regular, leave not neat (oh yeah-yeah)

Gettin' green like broccoli, how could I not be

Let Go & Let God,Revenue Retrievin’: Night Shift,2010.0,"Let go and let God
Fight your battles
All you got to do is just believe
And have the faith of a mustard seed

Ooh, Right now it's feast or famine
Either your eating or your starving
Houses upside down foreclosure government auction bargain
It's nasty out here it's bad it's awful as one big yesterday
Befor yesterday they picked up my car got repossessed
What's next?
They found cancer in her chest
My lil homie momma maine, they talking about cutting off her breasts
Ran hella test, mammograms and stuff
Nervous breakdown her husband left when it rains it pours it's rough
Somebody got shot today and everybody knows who did it
It's easy to kill a man but its harder to live with it
Karma used to take three years but now it only take thirty minutes
The victims family shed they tears Memorial Day they go to visit
The grave site the rest of the place were the family members layn
And then they light a candle and put flowers on it maine
A lot of my folks still here a lot of my folks been danish
Got to provide you with the peanut butter and jelly
But you got to make the sandwich

Let go and let God
Fight your battles
All you got to do is just believe
And Have the faith of a mustard seed
Let God fight your battles
All you got to do is just believe
Ans Have the faith of a mustard seed

I'm on the line with my relative she crying
She said: 'He might not come when you call him
But he always right on time.'
I said: 'Thats old people talk.'
She said: 'them old people ain't lying I was in church in
The other day and all i put was a dime
A dime?
Yep, a dime triple times I got breaded back today just enough to spend
But in a whole other way my income tax came in
Got some credit cards to pay and I own a couple friends
I said I'm saved ain't nothing to be ashamed
We all in the same boat but God is in the blessing game
The majority of us is broke we all going through some thangs
You gotta pray and hold onto your hope like a hub cap in the fast lane
My daughter pregnant and her boyfriend don't give a damn
Cereal, milk, cheese and egss apply for the WIC program
EBT, EBT, Electronic benifit transfer, it's plain to see
Single parents got it hard


It don't matter what your going through
Trust in God & he will see you through
If you ain't got no money if you don't have no gas
If your in a relationship & seem like it ain't gonna last
Let go and let God, let go and let God, let go and let God,let go and let God ..
Let him fight your battles
Sometimes you got to moan
And This what i like to say
If you're in the projects, let go and let God
If you're in that prison cell, just let go just let go and let God
If you're in front of the judge , just let go and let God
Let go, let go & let God
If your down at the Welfare office, let go and let God
If somebody is standing in front of you got a gun pointed at you
Just let go and let God just let go and let go ,Yes he will he will fix it for you
I know he will just let go just let go and let God ..",https://genius.com/E-40-let-go-and-let-god-lyrics

Cause I'll probably never ever see the pearly gates
At the pace I'm going now, it'll be too late
Can ya taste it? Go on and smell it
You know what that is? (What is it?) Sucker repellent
I spray myself with it every morning, you dig?
I spray myself right before I leave the crib
Hot ones echo through the ghetto, bullets ricochet
I'm bendin' corners in my Cadillac Escalade
It's summertime and I'm scorchin', fuck a bulletproof
I'm hella keyed and I'm perkin' off that num num juice
I'm in the traffic with my music on STORM
Got a ticket just for blowin my, HORN (ba-baaa, ba-ba-ba-baa-baaaa)

Facts Not Fiction,Practice Makes Paper,2019.0,"African-Americans have long been acknowledged for their creativity and genius
In theater, dance, music, art and literature
But there's another kind of creative contribution African-Americans have made
And that's the art of invention
(
Helluva made this beat, baby

My people don't get they props, it's not a mystery
Bet y'all didn't know there was a black man named Nearest Green
That taught Jack Daniels how to make whiskey
They wanna leave us up outta history and keep us hidden
Let me break down a few things that we invented
There was a black nurse named Marie Brittan Brown, listen
She invented the first home security system
There's a long list of winners, not no losers
Otis Boykin developed the IBM computer
George Washington Carver invented peanut butter, that's what they say
Have you ever had a sandwich called PB&J?
There more to us than thuggin', jewelry, twerkin', sports, and entertainment
Sellin' dope and murder, funeral arrangements

Back then they didn't treat black people equal
He was also granted a patent for the first traffic signal (Oh)
God gave me the gift of spit and grabbed the mic
The slavemaster didn't want us to learn how to read and write (For sure)

If I die today, will they try to get at my broad, my bitch?
On some old double back and I always had eyes for her type of shit?
Ain't no tellin', that's what Willie told Nelson
Don’t nothin' surprise me or amaze me these days, it’s crazy
I survived and made it through the sickest and toughest times: the '80s
The crack epidemic, hubba heads and droamers
Smoking coke outta TV antennas and blood donors
When it was organized game, not organized lame
When niggas had some real reasons to put some change on yo' brain
When we practically lived on I-5 on our way to La La Land

They say we gotta do better, so I'ma take it there
Can’t afford health care but can afford hair
And a new pair of Jordans, probably got two pair
Designer rims, tires, and a spare
We got our priorities fucked up but that’s life
You in the books, I'm on the ave shooting dice
Wanna move my kids up out the hood and spoil 'em rotten
But in the suburbs they got drugs like Oxycotin
I got one foot on my pulpit, the other one on the block
One hand on the Bible, the other one on my Glock

Raw, tightest thing I ever saw


Uhh, you make my life complete; you got my back like a car seat
You don't need no makeup ma, you look good when you sleep

Prepare for the jack if ya sellin' coke
As long as I got me a strap nigga, I'm never broke
As long as I got me a strap, I'm never broke

Found the nigga car at the mall on bricks
Beat strip, beat tip fucked him like a bitch
I'm that nigga to hate playas
A playa hater starvin' like Somalia
You got some yola?
Cause I'm right back chokin' again
Chokin' mo' now than I did before I went in
Tomorrow I got to go take a piss test for real
I'm tryin' to clean out my system with stay clean and golden seals
But I'm gon' be late, I'm on vacation
Three weeks is too early for me to go back on a violation
Fuck my P.O. I need some M-O
N-E-Y so I can get high and kick in this nigga's door
It's four in the morning I'm on a mission peep
The best time to catch a nigga in his sleep
Wake ya ass motherfucker I know ya rich
Tell me where the fuck is your scratch or else I'mma bust ya bitch
Dude didn't agree so I tied him up
And made him watch me poke her, I'm never broke
Dude didn't agree so I tied him up
Then I made him watch me poke her, I'm never broke
I'm never broke

Baby crevice was tight like a pair of vice grips
I looked at potna and said ""You must got a little dick""
Havin' fits, yeah he was cryin' like a toddler
Nigga couldn't stand hearin baby scream and holler
I said ""You got one mo' time my nigga, where is the mail?""
He said ""It's in the den, right hand corner, top vent""
Now, folks, remember that I'm scandalous and I'm anti-fuckless
I carry diseases such as herpes and nut pluckers
Nutted in the bitch, kissed her on her lips
Made her get up and suck a little of my dick
The bitch had her some game though
Ya know she deep throated my pickle...and oh
I dropped my strap like a sucker would
She said ""How does it feel"" I said ""Good""
She said ""You know this ain't weather to mix business with pleasure""
I said ""I know this ain't the weather to mix business with pleasure""
She said You know this ain't the weather to mix business with pleasure
Shit, she tried to bite off my pecker
Hell breaks loose, I'm hecka juiced, and that's the truth
Reach back as far as I can go and knock the shit out the ho
Picked up my tech n-up (up) off the grin-ound (ground)
Pistol whipped potna, tied up sittin' d-in-own {down}
I need a flathead screwdriver but a butter knife'll do
To the vent I went to collect my revenue
Struck out the side as if I was Dave Stewart
Hopped in my hoo-ride made a left on Newark
Through the dark alleys black this black that
As long as I got me a strap look I'm never broke, yeah
I'm never broke

Oh I see
So what you're saying is that a pillsbury Is something like an investment
Keep your revenues up to par
And a pillsbury is a strap
Precisely that's how motherfuckers make them fat g-in-et backs {get-backs}
See I'm way respected in the rap industry
Cause I skip, spit that real-life type shit
Feel it, so let's separate the true from the false
The punk from the tardy
And the motherfuckin' good from the naughty",https://genius.com/E-40-neva-broke-lyrics
Pain No More,The Ball Street Journal,2008.0,"E-40!

Chuck Taylor, Big Snoop, California's Finest!

West Coast!

I'm doin' everything I can to get my buzz on (Gotta get mah buzz on)
Tryin' not to feel this pain no more (No more, no more, no more)
That's why I'm poppin' these pills and smokin' this dro and drinkin' this henny straight
Tryin' not to feel this pain no more. (No more, no more, no more)

I came from the bottom of the barrel
To everyday new apparel, from a shoe string budget
To more jewelry than a pharaoh
About a place called Vallejo
House smaller than that hut
First city in California to go bankrupt
Came a long way let the truth be told
Penitentiary chances sweatin' over the stove
Seen 'em come and go, I'm the last of my crop
Don't compare me to nobody less ya talkin' bout Pac
Just tryin' to survive and stay alive
So many of my people done died
Now days, you an OG, if you live to be 25
My partner in there with his grand daddy, doin' 25
Liftin' water bags, doin' Burpees exercise
I hand pick my friends, cause people ain't trustable
Feelings like bras, their motives is questionable
Suckers sneak diss me then call me up on the phone
They say 40 Water I just wanna be on


Yeah
Hey yo 40
Let me talk to you for a minute, homie
They say money make the world go round
And since I'm worth 20 mil
I wanna see this bitch spin like the rims on a Schwinn
Hop on that bike, ride through the neighborhood
Compton on smash, them boys 
get cash
Money like Baby do
, I gotta scar over my heart
Cause that's what hatin'll do
So watch ya back like a tattoo artist
A coffin don't give a fuck about who the hardest
You lay with the people who more pray
Get ya name etched in stone, witcha born day
Small talk over a glass of Grand Marnier
As I sip from the class, my mind starts packin' his Louis Vatton bags
Take a trip to the past, hear that shot gun blast
See my brother lying dormant, IV's in his arm
Can't you see he got piss bag?
17 years old and you niggas wonder why I'm so cold


Let me get a fifth of Celandia
Plate of some candy
Cindy, Sandy, Mindy, Mandy
Tina, Brandy, Keisha, Angie
Man we, can we, all get a long
Two shots of patron
I did it till the break of dawn
Big fish in the pond, runnin' my triathalon
Doggy dogg, keep the bomb
One of a kind, blow yo mind just like Einstein
Blow and shine
I'm gettin mine, prime time like 21
Get 'er done, Everything in my life I make it look like fun
Every day of my life, I'm tryin' to get my buzz on
Cuz on, some on other shit, I'm keepin' it on the under, bitch
So much pain I over came, same thing
Me and 40 and Game came from the same gang
But you wouldn't understand
I'm populatin' wit my weakest translation
That's my main mane, let me hit that damn thang",https://genius.com/E-40-pain-no-more-lyrics

I grew up in the Bay
Where the hustler plays
Aw-yay!
I'm sorry baby I can't change my ways
I grew up in the Bay
That's how the hustlers play
Aw-yay!

'Member Mr. Flamboyant way back in '89?
Well back then I was selling tapes out of the trunk of mine
I put my car into park and let the beat explode
Within an hour, guess how many tapes I sold?
I got the power, I'm feeling my Wheaties I can't stop
I bought a clothing store right down the street from Rich Art's barber shop
Now I'm popping, ain't nothing wrong with nothing I do
As long as I pay my tithes and the internal revenue
I'm booking studio time, Solano Avenue
At Studio Ton's to make a hit or two
Classics for the future that ghetto gold super duper
Hits like Hurricane and Captain Save A Hoe


Money ain't changed me, money changed the way people think about me
When I was broke, all I had was my family
It kinda hurt me when they closed down (Who?)
The Music People, Jason Blaine and them downtown
They was around before I even owned a bottle
(Like that then,) like George's Music in Chicago
Like 7th Heaven up in The Show Me State, Kansas City
Jones & Harris
, 
Long Beach V-I-P
 & T-Y-E's


I grew up in the Bay, Cali-for-ni-a
Where the Oakland Raiders and the 49ers play
I hear everybody talk about where they stay
Well how come I can't talk about where I stay?
The Yay, where we pop our collars
Jack our slacks, and make them dollars
Write these raps, and spit this game
And show the whole world, that we ain't no lames
I can't change my ways, I been a hustler for days
The way I walk and I talk, it's not a fad or a phase
A fling, a fluke or a joke, or some old gimmick that's staged
But it's the way I am, I can't change my ways


Whoa, Forty Fonzarelli, Chris Bentley, S Dog, we keeping it real
Y'all don't wanna see us
Cause we gone kick up a lot of fuss
In the dust, from The Bay to LA

Broke up or broke a long time ago, get money or get lost

Smoking like a chimney, higher than the trees in Yosemite
Twisted like a pretzel, drinkin' cranberry and kettle juice

Now, they know my name all across the world
They say Earl, EARL!!
They say Earl, EARL!!

I'm from Vallejo, California, land of the homer
Sides lost lives, politics and drama
Over supersize, thump young in a hornya
Watch out for that boy in the hoodie, man, he a monster
Light a sucker up, fried buster like Chimichanga
Somebody come scoop his ass, call a coroner
I guess that's the way we bread
Chemical babies mislead
It's spooky out here in the Yay
These goblins will get on your head
These thundacat's management ain't scared to be deceased
They always cover up they ears
When I'm yelling and hollering out peace!
They going through it, they cranky, stressed out and tense
They starving, they hungry, they eating soup with chopsticks
Plus, it's a shortage on purple, and it's a drought on them bricks
So he'll go decide to do a kick door, and pull a few licks
Some of them parents on drugs, some of them never been loved
Some of them want to be thugs, some of them just need a hug


I'mma be around for a minute
So get used to it, I was through with it
Before most of you marshmallows knew want to do with it
Pushing them zones, serving that drome
Balling like I play hoop with it
Never at home, always be gone
Doing a show on the verse split
Let it be known, I tote my chrome
Refuse to get caught loose with it
Looking down at my shoe with it, I'mma real baboon with it
40 over there slipping, he snoozing, he ain't wake
He looking like a plate, he chipped up and draped
You fuck niggas got me fucked up, nigga, I'm a shooter
Think about the consequences, nigga, I got gouda
And niggas with gouda will send a nigga, fuck a case
Cause niggas with gouda will have your whole family erased
But that ain't something I endorse, I only wore it by force
I'm trying to teach the youth to be loyal and play sports
Instead of in and out of court
And back and forth to prison, utilize they skills
And stay up out the system

And she was there for me until I ran away from the pad
And now she disowned me and she don't claim me

I'm on this AK47 I ain't talking bout the gun
Rolled up in a slit bix with the bubble pound
Fat bank roll man my money can't fold
I been getting bread since I was 12 years old
Pull up to the trap with the boom blam blap
Stapler in my lap case I gotta make em scat
Sitting in my Louge with the neck full of gold
On the phone with the homie with my bitch on hold
I'm so high, I'm so bent
I'm so zapped, I'm so hent
I'm so me'd out, me me me
Ooh me, I'm in love with me
State to state, internationally
I get cake they can't fuck with me
I just ate but I'm still hun-gray
I'm a ape not no mon-kay

The hustle, the shrime, I want it, it's mine

In the parking lot throw it up already on my seventh cup
Drop me fore I pulled up, tonight I'm finna live it up
I'm feeling like don't talk to me, I'm feeling like don't touch me
I'm feeling like don't look at me, I'm feeling like don't bug me
No I'm not I'm trippin' sweetie I'm just bullshittin'
Tell me what you want to drink I'll buy it what'chu sippin?
The Vodka or this Landy no mistaking for no trickin'
Hella batches in this muthafucka wanna get with pimpin
Na I'm a take it, so listen while I put'chu up on game
Walk around this muthafucka ask about my name

Solid as rocks keep it funky like dooky slang

Stick with what I got, don't need no new friends
Because the truth of the matter, now that I think about it
People that I thought was solid turned out to be salad
Tipsy while I'm servin', smokin' urban
Sippin' Kuiper Belt, that's E-40's new bourbon
I'm whiskied, I'm burnt, and I don't care
Everybody on the soil know I ain't all the way there
I like to hear myself talk, no shuttin' up
Triple fit the triple shots in my cup
Ready to squabble and knuckle up
Prepare for altercations when confrontations 'bout to erupt
Anybody can get it, ain't nothin' changed
All it take is some little itty-bitty chump change
It's triflin', it's scandalous, shit can get sour

Gamble for push-ups when I slap bones
Wrist full of VVS's, them certified stones
Never know who been listening when you talkin' on them phones
Gotta stay polished and crispy and buttoned-up
Keep a 1911 Kimber Michael nine on the tuck
Gotta watch your whereabouts, be on the hush
They'll sneak you, they'll dirt you, shoot up your truck

Church burnings and vandalism

Even in the church house on a Sunday
Ice up in my mouth, my grill look like an ice tray
Everything designer, customize fitted
Authentic material, cut and so knitted
Upper body flooded, water around my neck
Half an M it cost me for the whole set
Still wet behind the ears, ears wet
Living my second childhood, young vet
Bitch, I ain't ever wrong, I stay correct
Still got money in the streets from '88 that I need to go collect
I'll bust my TEC if I have to protect my well-being
I am an animal, not a human being
Color me a hustler, something that you ain't
I move around, paint the town, go hard in the paint

This an AP on my wrist, not a wristband
Taking risks in the kitchen, pepper in my hand
I turn a rack into a hundred bands

Popular in my region, trench star
Triple beam boy, jelly jar

Jarritos is my favorite soda
A dollar and some change it cost me for my Rover, uh
And fuck my enemies
Any of 'em threaten me then it's gon' be some life-threatening injuries
When they smelled that smell, they knew they was about to lose 'em
'Cause when you die, you have a bowel movement
Play with me, I lie in wait
Make you think that I'm scared, you'll meet your fate
Your life will be over, they'll close the drape
Bring the evidence markers, the white chalk and yellow tape

E-40!

From a small ass little tadpole swimmin in a fallopian tube
To a fixture on my soil, a stand up type a dude
I was brought up in the crack game dealin and pushin that stuff
Arguing with my folkers cause we loved eachother so much
Ditchin and dodgin the rollers, grippin the block real tuff
Strikin and scootin them Novas and them Chevrolet stepside trucks
Me and my brother Dennel, Kevin, Dalon, and Black
Little Ray, Billy, and Ivory and them from the Magazine Street camp
Posted up like thumbtacks, talking on faulty big backs
Motorola, A1 yola, glad bag fulla Tic Tacs
In the mean time, in between time, in my spare time writin raps
In the front yard, in the driveway, on the concrete shootin craps

You think you know, but you really don't have no idea
Listen to discography of E40, real talk for real
Moons ago, way before I even had a career
I got my nickname on the turf for drinking hecka beer
And never letting the older cats up in my hood pump fear
Funkin with my own soil, listen here
Jealous cause we had all the broads and all the gear
Up the ladder I'm tryin to climb, game sharper than a porcupine spine
Don't gimme nothing, I'mma work for mine, try and grind, grit and grind
Hot ones echo through the ghetto, funkin all the time
I thank the Lord for giving me the gift to spit this rhyme

A loaf of bread, a stick of butter and some milk
Around the corner from the spot where all the dealers dealt
Trials and tribul-i-zations, me and my peopl-i-zations
Tryin to get this music off the ground with high ass expectations
Took a little time and patience, a little faith in God
To make a long story short, look at me now sahob
I'm doing it chubby like the checker, chunky like the soup
A de- a decade and a half and still in the loop
In case you suckers didn't know, I told you once before
I ain't rapping too fast, see y'all just listening too slow
I paved the way for the independent grind
The industry they mimick me, but don't wanna gimme mine",https://genius.com/E-40-fallin-rain-lyrics

Oh yeah

I was the oldest brother of four
Doing whatever I had to do to survive
I'm not sayin' what I did was alright
Tryin' to break outta the ghetto was a day-to-day fight
Been down so long, gettin' up didn't cross my mind
I knew there was a better way of life and I was just tryin' to find
You don't know what you'll do until you're put under pressure
Across Magazine Street was a hell of a tester

It's mainey in the slums
Killers, hookers, and bums
Sleepin' in the parks
Homeless people pushin' they shoppin' carts
She used to be thick, but now she sucked up
On that glass dick, lost her butt
Home invasions and robbers
Master Lock kick-doe stoppers
Dice game crackin', burpin'
Rivals slide through, get to squirtin'
Bust back, get off
Protect yourself at all costs
Here come the po-po, the cherries, they swarm
Be quiet, it's body cameras on they uniforms
And I ain't tryin' to go back, I'm reformed
Got Jesus Christ tatted on my arm
If you ain't got haters, you ain't doin' enough
My people be jealous, they hella envious
Mayhem and drama
It's sick out here, teenagers'll jump your mama
Sucka shit to the fullest, by far
They'll record you and holler out: ""WORLDSTAR!""
And I don't like that shit one bit
Karma'll come back and bite you like a tick
We use dope fiend matches if we ain't got a lighter
Burned down woods like a forest fire
Up the street, down the street, they war

Feudin' like the Hatfields and McCoys
Grew up with each other, used to be boys

Something gotta give cause if it, if it don’t i’m a pull a lid think i would
See that boasty nigga there he clown over there stuntin
Betta tone it down lookin like shark bait ridin roun town
Hundred thousand with the jury ridin with the motherfuckin top down
Everything black, black hoodie, black car,  black e up
15s couple traps like a good talk
Mug mean got him under my radar scheme
Investigator dancin like the cats for the dollas
He betta have the master like pitbull no stoppas
Alarms and the cameras with a couple rottweilers
Cause i’m layin down everything even grandmas
He woke up in the cold sweat finger on the tap
Cause he heard a noise dogg walkin in the back
Hella paranoid cause he the nigga with the sack got tree for sale
But he ain't ridin with that crap
Hundreds in the kitchen? Under the couch
Any amunition all through the kitchen
His family christian they from the south
Had a premonition figured it out
One or couple weeks ago caught me in the act when I was try’na tip toe
Snuck up on me from the back put the topic to my temple
Cause i didn’t get the memo brought the noise like a simple
Put the barrell to my dental
When i was sneakin through the window
With my underground extender in the middle of the night
On the morning of the mental and i brought out the light and door frame wriggled
Put the law in his own hands pop me like a pimple


Look gun dollas young nigga all gunpowder
Slidin through the slums lay a bum down for 1 dolla
Ready for the jack move niggas out to get the fatties or the achoo
On the creep in the chevy with the mac oo banged out with a face full a tatoos
Like cashews watch niggas go nutty on a mission for the money
Come out with a bloody wudy if you thinkin it was cute
Situation got to get ugly like fat bitches in the bathroom
Sack niggas on the map bout to get the scraps creepin  like some racoons
Black hoodie with the black mask, sorry about the bad news
Got your chick tookin this sip lookin throw the bar cause your click lookin like lunch meat
While niggas out here starving eat em up, hit em up, lit em up
Hit em up with the guards
Get in that ass like enema, denema, cinema wiff a the gas
Nigga where the stash at put it all in the bag pack
Ain't talkin bout half that’s what the little homie told the other nigga
When he pulled a bullet point at his body with the mac
Winning his money back from the dice game
Cause the nigga just got cracked
Time to hit a lick my nigga this is a jack that’s what’s up


See I go hard or go home cause that’s my motto nigga
And I got great kool aid it's undiverted my bottle nigga
And they got me on one now they rollin on this solo
Bunch of hollow points in this paper bag fore they all black pulled off four 4s

Full of my Wheaties, yes indeedy, M-16's don't shoot no beebees
Programmed to amputate anything that gets off in my way
Then I put them same size left over bullets up in my A.K
I can't wait 'til we bump heads
Chorus:
It on, on sight day and night no matter what I'm dumpin'
I'm tryin to see you niggas 'bout somethin' (2x)
""I'm heated, them niggas cheated"" - 3X (in background)
We had a meetin', shit 'posed to been squashed (3x)
Shit was 'posed to been squashed

I've got a hunch; meet me at the Olive Garden spot let's do lunch
Fool and dem tried to pass the buck and set us up for lumps
Sons of bitches must think we some chumps
Time to break out the pipe bombs and the pumps

Nigga fuck stress and pull lick, we kick in the door with full clips
Out of Magnums packin when we blast 'em we all out for the chips
FOol, 40-Water never slip, saw the niggas quick and then dipped
Before we spark the pipe bombs, and blow them niggas shit to
Side-ways up off they block, poppin gears in a big block
All out non stop riders until our casket drop
We smashin, blastin on any, while I remember many
Dash and blastin double two-three's, fuck the enemies
Chorus

One of my big dudes up out HPA shot me a kite today
He up in Pelican Bay three striker
Doin 25 with a L cause he won't tell on one of his
High-ranked dudes in position who wears a diaper
With the shit stacked on the side of his waist
Blood splattered all on the windshield wiper
Somebody tried to take his face - caught him up in his Viper
Loose as a goose ass out tried to down him like a sniper
Hyperventilated started havin' seizures
No feelings in his legs, arms, or his sneakers

We stand tall, like Manute Bol with bigger balls than RuPaul
Strapped with 4-4's down to execute all y'all
Don't want to see us niggas on a mission
150 round drum 45 slugs bitten
No remorse hit by the hardcore fo' sho'
Leave him stuck in his front seat
70 rounds through his front window
Ain't no fuckin' with G's
Fill 'em up to they neck from they knees
Leave 'em dyin' in the street as we escape on they goldeeze

It’s Gotta Get Betta,Revenue Retrievin’: Day Shift,2010.0,"It's tight out here man it's real tight
'It's real tight mane'
I don't know if it's goin get no better man
'It gotta get better man'
I mean
'What'chu mean?'
It's just seem like it keep getting worse and worse man
'It is though to be honest with you though family
It's crazy, it's ugly out here'
Uhh!

Pocket full of lent, a bucket with a dent
Bill collectors calling all day barely paying the rent
Eviction notice on the door landlord acting just like an anus
On the phone with PG and E try'na make payment arrangements
Glue codes high, higher than it's ever been
Cold part about it, can't afford my medicine
We gotta new president, hopefully he's heaven sent
A young black man highly educated intelligent
I was raised in the hood so what the fuck
When we a do anything to make a buck
I got the potentials but I ain't got the credentials
They say that it's simple they say it's all in my mento
My grandma just passed and I'm just leaving her funeral
The martition did a heck of a job, she look beautiful
Shortly after that bout a month in a half long
The good Lord called for my granddaddy to come home

I go hard all day
But I can't sleep at night
I got money on my mind
And right now everything's tight
It's gotta get betta
It's gotta get betta round here
Cause it can't get no worse
It's gotta get betta
It's gotta get betta, aye
It's gotta get betta
It's gotta get betta, aye
Cause it can't get no worse

Uhh! Have you ever fell out with your folks that'chu co-sign
Cause you wanted to borrow some money but'chu didn't have it at the time?
Well I did and the little bit that I got I earned it
But family, I can't squeeze juice out of attorney
Should I start selling trees, or should I keep my job at Applebee's
Why set up for pennies, when I can make G's
My bank killing with these overdraft fees, bouncing checks and
My credit already fucked up so send me to collections
And to make things worse, I just found out
They called me at work the doctor say I got gout
When got tested the other day wasn't feeling too great
Cause gout feels ten times worse than a toothache
Car broke down, cell phone off
But I ain't goin kill myself, I ain't soft
Even when I be drinking I be talking to the man up above
Lord, when my time is up, will you let me into your club?

I go hard all day (I go hard)
But I can't sleep at night (I can't sleep)
I got money on my mind (money on my mind)
And right now everything's tight (it's tight mane)
It's gotta get betta (It's gotta get betta)
It's gotta get betta round here (that's real)
Cause it can't get no worse (can't get no worse)
It's gotta get betta (It's gotta get betta)

Cause it can't get no worse (can't get no worse, uhh)

Blessed are the meek
For they shall inherit the earth (what else mane)
But people on the street (what they doing)
Still self-medicating away the hurt (that's real)

To save the babies (save the babies)
Have you looked in these kids eyes they are all so angry (all so angry)
Things are gotta get better (what else mane) Better

OOOUH! Ain't got no dope on the streets, man, I'm behind on my rent
I ain't got nothin' to show for all the fetti that I done spent
I told my mama to cash out my life insurance policy
The money that she was planning on using to bury me
Mayne, my ribs touching, my papers strugglin', mayne
All my life I've been hustlin', runnin' in place
But can't seem to finish the race
Seen dudes get whopped in the face, plucked like a bass
Flew into space for senselessness
That's why I stay prayed up and say my grace even when I'm blended
Never know when your life is suspended
God can take his arms from around you and easily end it
At any time, any place, anywhere, I know that my life done been spared
On several occasions, suckas hatin', I’m still here
How come loved ones fall out and never talk again to each other?
Why does it take a funeral to bring family together?
Bad weather always looks worse through a window
Stressin' and rubbin' my temples
I make it look easy but it's really not all that simple, OOOUH!

Young dude full of soul food, mama cooking pork chops
Uncle slapping dominoes, sister playing hopscotch
And this before the block got hot and infected
And everybody knew my granddaddy well respected, check it
Time went on and the game kicked in
I was losing comrades, either death or the pen
I was losing comrades but I'm stackin' them ends
Whoever go to 600 how we losin' our friends
When grandmama passed, that's when it all went bad
Aunties don't talk, my cousin fightin' his dad
And there's no Thanksgivings like the ones we had
And it's sad, so I express through a pen and a pad
I'm on my third wind, pimpin', knowin' Jesus is with me
Ain't no weapon formed against me that could come and defeat me
I be post in the cuts when them angels come get me
Until that day, homie, just pray for me

I've seen a lot of pain since I was a child, so

My kinfolk baby mama on welfare, they house is bigger than ours
'Cause they got Section 8 vouchers, WIC and benefit cards
My homegirl daughter diabetic, she like to eat a whole lot
She only nine-and-a-half and taking insulin shots
My dude got a heart condition, his ankle be swollen
'Cause he got high blood pressure and he refuse to quit smoking
But I'm no better than y'all, I like to drink alcohol
Break out the pen and start writing about the things that I saw
Like kilograms of that raw and uncut Peruvian flake
Wrapped in aluminum foil and duct tape
Bust open and throwed in a pot, foamy and mushy
Melted and locked in a shape of a gigantic sized white cookie
Put on the towel and dried and broken down into zips
Quarters and halfs and sixteenths of yola get flipped
I maintain my faith in G.O.D 'cause it's just a test
Repent and confess, extra grateful, man, yes, I'm blessed, OOOUH!

Don’t Shoot the Messenger,The Block Brochure: Welcome to the Soil 6,2013.0,"I got love for real dudes good brothas don’t respect suckas
What want for myself i want for others
I had holes in socks and my draws growin up stressin
Didn’t have a lot of money and material possessions
Pop warner and little league pitched played out field
Had a valet times hill and paper route to help pay the bills
My hood is a battlefield lots of talent a skill
Women smart enough to be journalists like federico winfield
We hollow broke we or got the latest iphone
A zap it or choke in the lebron zone
Can’t remember your sat but to every e40 song
You can recite every lyric and rap along
We living in different day such challenging times
Financial binds, senselessness crimes
I was talkin to my og he did 20 for real
He said if i had some bread i wouldn’t put none of these niggas in my will
Because they turn like a steering wheel and forget you when you in jail
They didn’t write me or nothin no commissary no mail
That’s what he said to me so i pulled out a g
Even though he used to run with my uncle i was just 3
Years old with a snotty nose and observing him being nosey
Soaking up game and ear husslin while they trade war stories
Thugin and bustin, death and destruction
Chaos and catastrophe, triump and tragedy

Don’t shoot him
Don’t shoot the messenger 

I don’t come from money i come from fried baloney
Starvin and thirsty eb key cards pop a murphy
Lord have mercy it’s brutal and murky out here on the ave
Where the mail man’s scared to come in you can’t catch a cab
Me and my partnas be gettin together drinkin, smokin herb
Talkin bout reincarnation comin back as a bird
I was channel surfing watchin the word network  cause i get inspired
When i here the ministry of joyce myers i use my rushcard to order her tapes
Or should i say dvds her’s and tb jakes
Is it any good people left on this earth that show pity
That will do anything for their relatives give up a kidney
But would their relatives do the same for them i don’t know
You’ll be surprised how selfish people can be even kin folk
I can’t imagine me goin to hell the devil’s a liar
What you wanna be i wanna be one of god’s angels when i die
The pearly gates not the underworld in the afterlife
At the end of the tunnel will there be light
Will the sky be purple, will the grass be blue
Will i recognise my family will they know me too
Living on this earth is a test behold
When god call we can’t put in on hold
I’m just the writer not the editor
Here go my letter don’t shoot the messenger


Hey I like to say to ugh all the industry people out there to that ugh
Has control of what we call hiphop, like for people to put more of an effort for hiphop to be what it was instead of the culture of violence that it is right now you know there’s a lot of things going you know what i mean
There’s a lot of people that put in a lot of time,you  the break dancers
The graffiti artist, people rappin all over the world
And i think it means a lot, i mean it means a lot to people like me that for all my life I’ve  been in hiphop
And it should more than just somebody standin on the side a the road selling dope
I mean that may or may not have it’s place too because it’s there
But i’m just sayin i ain't neva shot nobody, i ain't neva stab nobody
I’m 45 years old and i ain't i ain't got no criminal record you know what I mean the only thing I’ve ever done is care about my music
So I mean so while we teaching people what it is about life in the ghetto
Then we should be teaching people what life is in the ghetto me tryna grown up
And come up out of the ghetto and we need everybody’s help out there to make it happen
Hiphop needs to grow up and i’m a grown man i’m a be doin hiphop all my life
I need somebody’s help to help me do it. So let’s get this thing done",https://genius.com/E-40-dont-shoot-the-messenger-lyrics

From the Ground Up,The Element of Surprise,1998.0,"Testin, testin
It's game orienfested, size 6X vested
K-Cizee.. JoJo... that boy Too Sheezee, Todd Shaw
And Earl Stevens, a.k.a. Charlie Hustle
Hey Todd, you on? (Am I on?)
{*K-Ci and JoJo ad lib singing*}

The foundation was laid several years ago
I built a whole empire in your stereo
Got a four leaf clover representin the Bay
Oakland, Frisco, Vallejo, and EPA
We keep the shit together, let's keep it that way
From Sacramento all the way to San Jose
We in a new era, for ten years we made hits
So what's up E-Feezy? (We still the shit) Beotch!

How you think I got this pot belly, overnight?
Sheeit, a nigga was hungry, I had an appetite
Just like a lot of my people that's caught up in the struggle
Motherfuckers tryin' to bubble
Niggas tired of slangin' Barney Rubble
Gettin' in trouble and fuckin up
Parole got me makin my kids piss in a cup
It's cold, that's why I got a few bucks, I put up
From sellin greens, investing in some vending machines
From the ground up

We started, with nothing
From nothing, we made something
Nobody really gave a damn about us
From the bottom, we started
We started, with nothing
From nothing, we made something
Nobody really gave a damn about us
From the ground on up!

From the ground up, here go some details
This verse right here was made, said strictly for the females
Don't y'all know it's time for y'all to blow up, like Napalm
Instead of sellin Tupperware, and Avon
Get your business license, go on and put the peas in the pot
Tell your baby to get your baby daddy to buy you a nail shop
Or a beauty saloon, since he come to be the biggest tycoon
With methamphetamine labs and heroin balloons

The police pulled me over, laid a nigga on the ground
Searched my car real good, I know you know what they found
I had the trunk, full of that junk
X-Rated lyrics, laced with the funk
No doubt, I was just about to flood the streets
Big boxes full of tapes with them dope fiend beats
Two white boy rookies, mad as hell
Black man making mail, couldn't take him to jail


I spent sixteen hundred making Born To Mack
Used my nigga's gold ropes and his Cadillac
I was broke and starvin, didn't give a fuck
Couldn't tell me Short Dawg wasn't comin up
When motherfuckers roll by bumpin your stuff
It makes you feel good, like when you bust a nut
Now I'm a millionaire, and can't get enough
40, tell em how it is (way too tough Short Dawg)

When I first started rappin motherfuckers would cap!
That nigga fake he sound like Woody Pecker on crack (ha ha ha HA ha)""
Niggas would laugh and say I rap too fast way back then
But now I be catchin all kind of motherfuckers tryin to sneak my little old style in
And that's a compliment, cause I ain't trippin on that stuff
(what about the money what about the money)
Ask me, sheeit, I think there's enough money up in this bitch for all of us

The Recipe,The Ball Street Journal,2008.0,"Hey, this is cooking with Brook
On the cooking channel
Today we're gonna be making c-crack

First take 36 ounces of coke
Mixing it with water in a pot on the stove
Next step to make them boulders add, baking soda
If the flame is low then turn it up and stir it up
Finally, just wait till it gets hard
Then bag it up, you got a key
Homie, that's the recipe, that's the recipe
T-t-that's the recipe
First take 36 ounces of coke
Mixing it with water in a pot on the stove
Next step to make them boulders add, baking soda
If the flame is low then turn it up and stir it up
Finally, just wait till it gets hard
Then bag it up, you got a key
Homie, that's the recipe, that's the recipe
That's the recipe

Before you decide to elect yourself in the game of dope
Better know that it is cut throat
Can't be cracking under pressure when your backed in a corner
Against the ropes
They ain't calling it snitching no more
They calling it telling the truth
They say you better get down first
Before they decide to get down on you
Mixing it up, shake and bake
It's 2008, they got more data than '88
We used to make crazy cake, flipping weight
Gotta get in and out before it be too late
I don't want to be 6 feet under
So I pack and tote my thumper
Suckas want to hate and block my thunder
'Cause I got more kicks than a punter
Murder rates go up in the summer
Killers go hunting like a hunter
(How good can you live?)
You can live good for 6 years
But then it's football numbers

First take 36 ounces of coke
Mixing it with water in a pot on the stove
Next step to make them boulders add, baking soda
If the flame is low then turn it up and stir it up
Finally, just wait till it gets hard
Then bag it up, you got a key
Homie, that's the recipe, t-t-that's the recipe
T-t-that's the recipe

Chef for the year, better yet, the fucking century
Dread head killers with me before dem up insolate
I'm in the kitchen scrapping up the pottery
Working with my hands like the maestro at the symphony
Sniff, I'm cocaine, shawty, take a wiff off me
Stiff a liffy pisso nigga come and comprehend from me
Talk slick to me, E40 style, you hearing me?
Got a green skirt and I bought it off a recipe
Hella p's, hella keys, yellow, purple, readily
Put me in the feds if these crackers on the recipe
33 yellow D's purchased off my recipe
Heavy cocaine in the G, plus I got a recipe

First take 36 ounces of coke
Mixing it with water in a pot on the stove
Next step to make them boulders add, baking soda
If the flame is low then turn it up and stir it up
Finally, just wait till it gets hard
Then bag it up, you got a key
Homie, that's the recipe, that's the recipe
That's the recipe

Well, it's Chef-boy-R-Bun B, the king of the kitchen
I got exactly what you need to do your thing when you pitching
Guarantee to add a few layers of bling on your stitching
Bein' teeded in your chest get you stinging and itching
Got to have the right ingredients before you can start
Like one part gangsterism with one part heart
Two parts of keeping it G and add you one hundred
Milligrams of a killer, man and you'd had done it
Put it all inside a Cadillac with them 3's and them 4's
Swang wide and mix scurrily while skating on vogues
Don't forget to shake them haters off homie that's a necessity
Now you done made you a trill, nigga, now that's the recipe

First take 36 ounces of coke
Mixing it with water in a pot on the stove
Next step to make them boulders add, baking soda
If the flame is low then turn it up and stir it up
Finally, just wait till it gets hard
Then bag it up, you got a key
Homie, that's the recipe, t-t-hat's the recipe

From sun up to sun down get our grind on
Tryna bust it wide open and build up my clank
Send a hit at these niggas so we could be the jank
You now how it is want everything for myself
Want every nigga scorin for me nobody else
I'mma dog it ain't not secret i want it all
Tha coke, dope, hoes and tha fancy cars
Tha game is cold but it's fair nigga
Can't trust no man cuz a nigga don't care nigga
Nigga will do anything just to be tha man wit all tha work
Kidnap yo wife and yo daughter erase you off tha earth
Them niggas cut throats this shit is real cuzen
Better know tha game cuz if you don't you get killed cuzen
Be ready to take a nigga to war behinds yours
Spark when it get dark and leave brains on the curve

Why you blockin us
Baller Blockin us
You niggas can keep tryin
Ain't no stoppin us

Niggas baller blockin so they lettin off shots
Tha feds came thru can't stop tha clock
Then why a nigga up tryna close my shop
Lovely came thru in a Bentley drop
Tha cadilac truck we painted then got hot
Still runnin thru them hallways tote'n a Glock
Word got around Curly tryna close my shop
Tha mail man down bad he can grab tha Glock
Tell tha stupid ho shut up she bouts to get popped
Tha cameras out and them lights is on
Them feds com'n thru and they gettin it on
So we duck and hide, supply and ride
Big party goin down wit Big Wood tonite
So we cocked tha Glocks
Cuz tha beef is rock
Niggas shootin out windows instead of head shots
Believe that playboy


Niggas be gold killin
(?) slippery like grease create y'all bin on a (?) scrilla
Call tha police on a young busta just tryna money mack on a million
You best respect tha game or get yo cap pilled in
Whoopin ass and takin names about my pay

I know I need to stop but I'm solja so fuck it
Besides I'm responsible fo supplin tha public
My daddy got shot so I'm holdin it down
Outline, out of bounds puttin four in a clown
Bitch answer when I call make me know you got my change
Is it explodin in yo brain, do you think I'm playin games
See that's why lil niggas like u get murder over 'caine
Put yo self in a spot where u won't be working again
I ain't gone let yo partners from yo block confuse ya
You broke 'em off a package and they tryna misuse ya
Now tell 'em who got assed out you and me too huh
And Bubba want his money so I gotta kill you now
And all these muthafuckin laws tryna take mines
I ain't wit that bullshit two at tha same time
Fuck I might at well give tha dope game up

Nigga, this rap shit slow?
I'll be back selling blow
Posted right there by the store
Selling narcotics for the low
Niggas think I fell off?
Niggas done lost they mind
Niggas think since I'm rapping now
I still got that line
Still got that line
Still got that line

Nigga still got that line

Nigga, this rap shit slow?
I'll be back selling blow

In the traffic, in the wind getting money
Never stunting clumsy gotta feed my family tummy
Ain't shit here funny
Pull your ho card, not a game motherfucker, this ain't gin rummy
It's funky out here - musty, keep your guns oiled up, not rusty
Not a starter pistol; pack something husky, bust the gusty
Sawed-off, something that'll get your point across
Knock a motherfucker head off; tomato soup, not chicken broth
Promethazine, no cough
; six-fifty with a 
brick of boat
 cost
If coke cost too much so I'm charging
Twenty-four, five for the margarine
I might bargain, or show you love for the butter
Peel your broccoli, give you a better price than your little plug
You could lose your life, catch a fucking slug, plotting on a balling-ass thug
I stay with the pyro on me cause ain't nobody gonna protect me like me
I don't want no cowards around me, big bank, FDIC


Nigga think I fell off? Posted up front of that store
With a hard ass kick of that blow (that snow), OG having his cho (money)
Another word for cho is doe (fetti), trying to outsmart the po-po (Five-O)
Come looking for me and I gotta go (what you do?), I'm running through the store back door
Knocking over candy and chips, commenced to hit the fence
It's not my first offense, about my dollars and sense
I like to trap and trench, we like to trench and trap
Everybody with me don't rap
Operation gouda stack, , in this world of pain no patch
Pain reliever disbeliever, push 
Keisha
, pack a 40-caliber gat
Got ho no more, toe-to-toe, don't nobody wanna fight no more
Throw it all away over a ho, never see the light no more
Ninety-nine plants I grow, got vegetables, outdoor seaweed, spinach
I'm not a save-a-ho, I'll break a ho, don't be surprised if I take your bi-nitch


Survival tactics, never hustling backwards
Throw-off methods, that's why I wear these glasses
So I can look like a nerd, po-po roll right past us
Savage-ass nigga from the gravel
Baller status, living hella lavish
You can find me at the shooting range, target practice
With a thumper in my fist going tactical
Shaka Zulu heart built for battle
Free all of my real ones missing summers
In the stew doing football numbers
Caught my brody with a K and some methamphetamine
Didn't take the plea bargain, so they gave him all day
All his family can do now is pray
Hoping they reduce his stay
Pass the hat around for the lawyer pay
Get him out before he hella old and gray
One day, I'mma probably be a deacon on the alter
Hopefully, I don't have to 
break bad like Walter
Get my hands dirty again and push birds

Started having money, buying things I used to couldn't afford
At the beginning of my mannishness I was the mannishest
I bought a nickel-plated .45th
Falcons, Granadas, Caddies and Fairlanes
Chevy Impalas, Cutlass and Mustangs
Donkey rolls, jewelry like a pharaoh
Troop jackets, d-boy apparel
Hop, weed, speed, coke, whatever you need
Knew how to add and subtract but barely can read
No, I can't - Yes, I did - No, I didn't
Either gon' be dead or successful or imprisoned
Triple beam scale, I was flipping the goup
Hella clientele, I was getting my loot
Concrete, I ain't made of feathers
Tear shit up just like some angry protesters

I come from the streets
Where they play for keeps
The strong and the weak
Gotta be concrete
I'm from the streets
Where every day they leak
Ambulance and police

You still in the game? Nah, we divorced
You make any change? No remorse
He full of shit just like a porter potty
His hustle game sloppy, triggered off on them boppies
I'm from what's right, maybe that's what's wrong
That's what I was just telling my little homie on the phone
Be a leader not a follower
If you will be a follower, follow the right leader
Stop thinking with your peter
My peter? Yeah, your dick
Why? A chick'll get you hit
Keep your eye on the sparrow
Get cornered and ambushed, they'll limit your space, your space is narrow

He put his foot where his mouth is - good riddance
Gunned him down in the drive-through of Kentucky Fried Chicken
They wasn't gangbanging, but they was set-tripping
Ate him up real good, but he still living
The victim's parent's lawyer on the case for real
Try'na put the nigga that did it behind bars to make him pay they doctor's bill
But the shooter a monster, he hella feared
So ain't nobody talking, listen here
And not only that, but the victim don't want nobody saying nothing anyway
Because when he get out and get his shit together
He gon' put them niggas under the weather

Or get yo' ass sprayed up, bitch nigga!

And there you have it! (And there you have it)
Anybody can get it (anybody)
Don't act like you can't get touched, peeyimp!
Yeah, my dude Bone Crusher (that's right)

Lifestyles,Grit & Grind,2002.0,"Desperado always drinkin' out the bottle
Young hyena with the HK hollow point staple spray
Turf tight soil block warrior from the avenue
Mean muggin' like I'm mad at you
Boiler Maker Baker's whiskey mixed in with my brew
Celebratin' smoking Mendocino bud this is the lifestyle of a thug
A hooligan a heathen wolverine everybody on my team got a triple beam
Tossin' candy to the dope fiends
Million dollar spot million dollar dreams
Four or five different colored techa-marines
Yellow diamonds and stones and two-way pager phones
Plushed out SUV's smokin Leprechaun
Flowers in the back seat watchin' Austin Powers with the windows up
Lost tryin' to get where we gettin'
Talking to the operator on my OnStar system

This is the lifestyle that I choose
We smoke tweed get ki'd all day and drink brews
Which of these rap stars fart, shit, burp and get paper
Spray myself with sucka repellent and shake haters

Every morning I got to have a nice fat joint and a hot bubble bath
Wrapped in a Backwood or a Zig-Zag
Eyes red like a broad on a rag
My pants sag down past my waistline with the vive
When I leave the coffee table got my nine by my spine
Funkin' like its goin' out of style
Mo' beef than a cow speakin ebonics
Evonics and broken English from Venus
Intelligent hoodlums and geniuses
From the inner city Al Capones and Frank Nittys
From the ruler to the tutor hubba heada shoota
In the back for a hubble rock or crack


See uh I just look like this but I'm really about my scratch
See what it is I want the po-pos to think that
I'm just as square as a box of apple jacks
I shoot craps drive GMC Avalanches and EXT Cadillacs
If you snooze you lose I know you got a lot a trust in your dudes
But check for traps and clues nobodys playin' by the rules anymore
Not even the people that made 'em up
My hood is corrupted and full of infidel one poverty
Not too much faithfulness mostly all betrayal
Mostly all my folks are dead or locked away in jail
Speakin' about some people that I miss
Tijuana Carter, Ricardo Slay and Lisa Smith
Fred, Tito, Pat and Kobe and OG dead brother Fab the big homie
Hillside representin' this to the fullest
And all my homies locked down pullin' bullets

(Surprise niggas!!!)
Biotch!!!
Surprise, the element, apply pressure
Surprise, the element, apply pressure
Surprise nigga!!
Surprise, the element, apply pressure
Surprise nigga!!
Surprise, them lies, I'm talking about the element of surprise

Time to go get some getback, never sit back
Why should I wait on a muthafucka to come and get me
When a muthafucka like me can whip back
If so step back, tax a muthafucka hella quickly
With a twenty guage, fully tellie
Have at his ass first, little remorse
St. Valentine's Day Massacre
Tryin' to hit that patna, dude in the passenger seat
LeSabre, bitch played us, he hate us, bitch made us
It's heinous, he hate us, disobeyed us, hiatus
Underrate us, underpaid us, tried to spray us and erase us
And is on, wonder if it's good or bad karma
So don't try to figure out, try to find out, it's a drought
Maybe that's why everybody walking here around with they lips poked out
So if you rook me
From enhancing growl, come and hook me
Buying yellow clusters instead of counterfiet dope
Alexander the Great, macadamia nut, chief rockin' soap
No rebate, no refunds
Fuck 'em and feed 'em deacons
Money back guarantee my ass
This is the future, that was the past
Square ain't nothin' 'bout this game we playa style
Able to smoke weed but you keep on laughin' and smilin
Set your ass up executioner style
Hit 'em in the back of the head until they dead
Down on the floor spread, they layin'
Liquid body clot, reekin' brains in the sky
Sleepin', nighty night nigga, nighty night nigga!!
Them niggas gone from magazines
I ain't even try my 4th of July pal

Surprise, surprise, surprise
Surprise, the element, apply pressure
Surprise, surprise, surprise
Surprise, them lies
I'm talking about the element of surprise

Here come a hundred of them dudes, fifth deep
Carryin' hero firearm, cause it's nice to be dry
Forteen and over LOG's and YG's ready to put down a homicide
Forty-five colt firearm, Remington sixteen guage shot gun
Two of them ultra-light machine bombers, AR fifteen and Tommy guns
Ready to run into bumbles
Rushin', all I need is a shooter with a Rueger ticket
See the definition of the element of surprise is when a nigga least expect it
Retrospect it, It get's hectic (mind's hectic)
See he probably would have been able to prevent if he would've saw it comin'
But he didn't, so he's in it, nigga should've went against the grain
See that's the perfect example of the kind of shit that can happen to a
Muthafucka when he owe too much to the game
When a sucka owe too much to the game
That ain't wise, see I got guys, somebody dies

Surprise, surprise, surprise
Surprise, the element, apply pressure
Surprise, surprise, surprise
Surprise, the element, apply pressure
Surprise, you got a bullet in your crizz'own
Surprise, the element, apply pressure
Surprizise, you got a bullet in your bizack
Surprise, them lies, I'm talking about the element of surprise

Sittin' here, just we'll let the fonk die down for a minute or two
Make it look like we a bunch of cuts finna beef
And get into it with some old other crew and hit all they spots at once
Do what we came to do and then get about our business with no delaying
Let's end it up and hit the freeway
I tell my v-lay, I bet you can't do the samething all over and over again
For something like about a weekand a half straight
Duplicate to instant replay, I hate haters that be hatin' on players like me
And the C-L-I-C-K
See what a sucka don't know is what a sucka can't see
And what a sucka can't see is what a sucka don't know
Finger on the chrome
Ridin' crusty with my war face on
Out the window yellin' die bitch die, die bitch die, die bitch die.....

Yaper or plastic, my back against the wall
Hubba rocks in my jaw, mouth full of spinach fetti
Fetch'n go-getters, hitters on my team on my squad
Ready to smash you niggas; ready to do our job
In the cut with them 16-year-olds that I recruit
Ready to bust a nigga shit, you better not hit dip or boot
I spit, nothin but the best of the sloop
The soil, the gutter, the unrecouped
I'm slick like this like I look (like I look)
I ain't gotta touch it no mo', even though I used to cook
The book of sugar, the tragic magic, the plastic, the habit
(Habit) The fiends gotta have it (gotta have it)

Run off your lip me I'm gon' bust your shit

No need to stop there, go 'head, go on and act like you act
Gloves be black, plus I feed bleed with mac
One or two stacks, put yo' head on no fix flat
With no getback, I get back to where the bricks at
Serve birds and from the curb serve Kit-Kat
Split that, feel that, and then I hit that
Big back, whole bunches know I spent that
I'm a boss on location, vacation for the whole unit
Hundred grand let 'em know I'm doin it
Hundred man's what I'm crewin it
Put my foot with the ankle and the shoe in it
You can bust yo' guns but now I bust yo' lip
And that's Click spit so don't you trip (HOEE!)
We stay high and we move zips
And only cop Bents fully loaded when they come with the kits


Bumpin your gums'll get your pumpkin put on display (on display)
Off with his head he wasn't usin it anyway
I told him to park his tongue but he kept on jaw-jackin and shit
Pillowtalkin and motormouthin and tryin to impress that bitch
Thinkin he bulletproof, just drunk a fifth of courage juice
Outside of the party loose, with a empty bottle of Grey Goose
Mad dog'n and talkin loud, feelin his Wheaties and oats (oats)
Comin at a player sideways in front of my cutthroats
I said, ""This nigga just high, give that nigga a pass
Don't take that nigga life,"" but he kept on talkin trash
I walked away and laughed (ha ha) but he knew he had it comin
That lil' nigga startin bustin, this lil' nigga started runnin
Rrrrrrrrah, rrrrrrrrah, left his ass leakin
With a hole in his chest and his head on the pavement gaspin for air bleedin
And he cain't believe it, one night'll change your life forever
Disrespect a pimp and I'ma bust yo' shit! Uhh

Used to buy shit off the lot, but now lately I've been leasin
Like the white man I've been thinkin, tryin to come up with a plan
How to spend this dope money, buy some houses and some land
Tryin to teach you niggas somethin, tryin to lace you like a shoe
Buy a couple of fixer-uppers pimpin it ain't gotta be brand new
I'm a boss about my shit, about the way I carry it
The way I wear my glasses low, the way I sport my toothpick
The way I pop it at a ho, the way I utilize my mouth
The way I keep my fuckin blowover over at a relative's house
Beware of yo' surroundings, gotta handpick yo' cronies
Gotta be about your allowance, and X out all the phonies
Gotta watch out for them folks, gotta watch yo' conversations
Gotta be careful on the phones cause them folks might be taping

I'm tryin to turn this thousand dollars into a quarter of a mill' ticket
Some of you suckers be lyin to kick it, but that ain't the fuckin way
Niggas be sellin mo' wolf tickets than fake autographs on eBay
My orangutangs'll growl, with our upside down smile
We been doin it for a while, you can check my d-boy file
I be fuckin 'em up like this man, I be killin 'em off like that
Divin up in them hoes mayne and treatin them hoes like rats

Niggas don't really know that I got my name from drinkin beer

My mentality, my frame of mind, all hood
I'm in the local booth with my nine, breakin down a backwood
Sippin on 40, drink cloud nine, try to get it while it's good
In the heart of the soil, in the middle of the paint, where it ain't
Where we park our cars on the grass, sell hop and push crank
Where the dopefiends dig in our tracks and siphon gas from our tanks
Where the biggest hypocrites in the church call themselves saints
I don't gossip like bitches I mind my own fuckin business
Dig yaper good money cause that sucker shit ain't nutritious
I don't be burnin no bridges I'm a loyalist 'bout my riches
Gumbo pots boil, good with the skillet like a chemist
Steady long like a female weave, cooler than antifreeze

I Had It In A Drought,The D-Boy Diary: Book 1,2016.0,"Do dirt buggies, station wagons, servin' the work
Looked up to OG's like Paul and Curt
Rest in peace Big Dank, Big Nate we miss you
When we get up there we gonna play dominoes for some pushups
Chalupa on my mind, all I know is the gravel
Give a fiend a line and take her car for collateral
The eighties was crazy I know you heard it
If you get a ticket, better deserve it
Sideshows jumpin' off after parties and things
Hangin' out the roof with big gold chains
My nigga Quarky used to get it, had the finger waves
High-top fades and French braids
Muscle cars, old schools, new school stunters
Plymouth need to manufacture new Road Runners
Me and D-Shot, big B-Lih and them
My best friend Billy, became Muslim
My love one to this day, that's the way it's gonna stay
Doin' the damn thing 'til I'm old and gray
On my way to cop five on the Highway 5
In the drought it was definitely worth the drive
An expert at grindin' when I was grittin'
My folks used to come down from Richmond
I had a plug in The Sco, a plug in The O
A plug in Pin-oh, and Sacramento
Biatch!

I was grindin', I was grindin'
While you niggas was in the house
(Know, you know, you know you niggas was in the house)
I'm shinin', Boy I'm shinin'
I had it in a drought

Monumental moves me and dudes play by the rules
Suckas be confused, bitches be lovin' on us, some youths
Never tryin' to lose, always in winnin' mode, we refuse
To let a sucka stop us
From gettin' our fuckin' coppers
Keep it lit, keep it pushin' and keep it movin'
I ain't a counterfeit bitch, I'm proven
We shittin' on haters, fartin' and pukin'
Stay away from us if you ain't with the movement
Dollar devoted, you better know it I'm for it
You name it I sold it so much paper came from it
When I was fifteen and a half plus four
On Solano Avenue I bought a clothing store
In Vallejo California entrepreneur
Next to Davenport and the check cashin' store
Across the street from Church's Chicken it was on
A couple doors down, Studio Tone
From the fourth to the twelfth I played the drums
We always wanted to make some songs
Me and The Click knew we was dope
Got my haircut from London Pope
He had the dopest fades in the parts
Special shoutout to Rich Arcs
I had a plug in The Sco, a plug in The O
A plug in Pin-oh, and Sacramento
Biatch!

I was grindin', I was grindin'
While you niggas was in the house
(Know, you know, you know you niggas was in the house)
I'm shinin', Boy I'm shinin'
I had it in a drought

It's a different era some dudes should wear mascara
Actin' like a botch, won't be surprised they cut off they crotch
People change like socks, I promise you playa, God is my witness
I just do me and my mind business
Once upon a time upon the soil
Before all the funk and turmoil
I met this gorgeous broad, she was cute
She played the clarinet at the band revue
She worked at Taco Bell when I was up at Grambling
Looked like someone done drew her, she was handlin'
She trust her first mind, though I was in there
I smoke a sucka like a cigarette
The realest nigga in there thought you thought that I told you
Hella years later still with my girl from high school
I had a plug in The Sco, a plug in The O
A plug in Pin-oh, and Sacramento
Biatch!

Gold ones, continue spinnin at you

And perpetuate the rate of the Golden State

And set a date and meditate and regulate


You can try
But you can't stop me, I'll be doin alright
Can't dilute cause I do it all night
I've been rappin on the mic my whole life
It's like I never stopped flowin, I keep goin
Like a river where it ends you never knowin
I don't even think about it, I'm a workaholic

And add the muthafuckin' gin to the same bottle (that's right)
Roll me a Swisher, put the ounce in the back (then what?)
I keep it the trunk right next to the gat (what they do though?)
Po-Po's jack but can't fuck with me (what you got?)
An open juice bottle and a little ol' doobie (what they got to kiss?)
Cops better kiss my ass 'fore a nigga like Legitimate blasts

Outsmart the Po-Po's
You know, that's what a muthafucka gotta do
Outsmart the Po-Po's
All they wanna do is ice you, they'd love to put a nigga on ice, you know
Outsmart the Po-Po's

Tell It Like It Is,The Ball Street Journal,2008.0,"How can I help you
What can I do for ya
Looking for that china white
Girl that's so soft
If I ain't got it
I know where to find it
If i can get it for you
Boss
How much you got in your budget
The more you buy the less it costs
I could front you a few off the side
As long as your ass don't double cross
You crossed a lot of racoons
Get your cranium sawed off
I got mouths to feed my nigga
I can't afford to take no loss
I can give your ass a number
Its up to you to keep it quite
You can't be a punk about the hustle
You gotta keep the money coming
I'm out here
Dealing with these suckers
Stopping the fake ass busters
They stab your ass in the back
These brothers turn on you
I know when its gonna be a shortage
How long this shortage suppose to last
I ain't got the weather channel
To predict the forecast
The plan is hustling
Cause there ain't no work there
Ain't no job
So they stuck in playing this game
And the next thing they gonna rob
Bite the hand that feed em
That shit right there ain't y’all
Two faced little ol’ heather
Working with the law
Man no matter what you do for  niggas
They ain't never gonna be satisfied
Tell it like it is
My whole thing is like
Why dudes be letting cats get in their ear though
Im just telling it like it is
I dont know what the fuck
Happened between ‘96 up to now
Nigga is hoes
I’ma tell it like it is
Man niggas is going out backwards man
Killas are snitching my nigga
Whats happening with  that
Tell it like it is
If there was a snake it would have
Bite ya
See you’ve been following so many nigga you wouldn't even know what hit ya
Now you don't know which way to look
You dont really know which way to turn
Got you trying to protect yourself
With all the bridges you done burned
You niggas cry to us nowadays
You niggas feelings get hurt too easily
Might as well wear a tampon might as well be a breezy
A closed mouth dont get fed
And a lazy hustler don't get bread
Pimping i can't read minds
I dont know whats in your head
Everybody think they know it all
Dont wanna hear nobody speak
Shut the fuck up and listen sometime
Even if you an o.G
Me personally  I'm a grinder
Can't let no grass grow under my feet
Dont nothing come to a sleeper but a dream
A vision without a plan is just a hallucination
I gotta lotta folks in the pen
Programming on vacation
I'm gonna give it to you straight
I ain't gonna give it to you late
Imma tell your ass whats real
I ain't gonna tell ya nothing fake
Man i got my own dreams
Everybody wants me to finance theirs
Tell it like it is
You know who i like i like that boy 40 man
He’s 20 years in the game and he consistent
Im just telling it like it is not all of them but a lot of these
New dudes is ringtone rappers man
Ima tell it like it is
Fools just have one album out
And act like they just it
Tell it like it is
Same song third verse
Its from the heart it ain't rehearsed
The world is full of associates but very few friends
Don't  wanna contribute nothing
But wanna help spend your ends
Think before you rocking your mouth
Park your tongue and lip
Watching who you talkin round
Never know who you're having dinner with
You ain't got nothing good to say
Dont say nothing at all
Thats what i was told
That's what i was taught when i was small
A lot of these so called artists got too much time on ya hand
Should be getting your money
On
Instead of hating on the next man
Its lonely at the top
But its next to crowded at the bottom
That's why I always keep my pistol cocked
In case i gotta stop ‘em
Stinkter(3:03)  in my lap
Trunk full of slap
Hollering at ‘em back
(3:06)
Pocket full of scraps
Nothing but thousand stacks
I’m old school acting a fool making my
Presence known
I look at business face to face
Dont like to talk on phones
When i'm at a stop sign or a red light I leave one car
Space in front of me
Tell it like it is
Just so i could have enough room to get up outta there
Just in case someone try to pop at me or something
Tell it like it is
Thats how i was raised
I'm still a student of the game
You could learn from a baby
I'ma tell it like it is
Man i was hollering at my grand partner
He said 40 return phone calls and you’ll keep your friends
Tell it like it is

But you ain’t gonna get it off or get no dough on the couch

If you get pressed by them people, tell 'em ""figure it out""
Keep what you know in your brain, don’t let that shit out your mouth

Is better than a whole lot of nothin'
Every time I take a step forward
I take a step back
And every time I take a step back
I take a step forward
Never kick a person when they down
Lift 'em up
You never know when you gon' need a hand
Or a buck


(Listen here, man)
If he on drugs and you knew him
Don't walk away from him, walk to him
Don't stay away from him, talk to him
Cheer for him, don't boo him
Tell him you here for him
'fore you lose him
Happy to hear from him
Move him
Be careful
But embrace him
Give him some game
Lace him
My mind is filled with rage
The ghetto is a cage
We got a lot of talent
But we ain't got no stage",https://genius.com/E-40-appreciation-lyrics

Nigga, what’s happenin wit' it? Sig Sauer clappin' wit' it
Got that double action wit' it, time for some action wit' it
Mouthpiece, I’m blackin' wit' it, Celly Cel in this bitch
Skip the particulars, I'm focused on gettin' rich
All on a bitch, turn 'em into actresses
In and out of hotels, nuttin' on mattresses
Tricky dick niggas trickin' off all they rent money
He say he pimpin' but baby that’s only tip money
I be laughin' at suckas because they game-less
Most of these niggas brainless, hit 'em up with the stainless
Cookin', like Black Angus, I can make you famous
Hug his mama while she makin' funeral arrangements
Smash off with a bitch named Brandy
First name Cognac, I’m talkin' 'bout Landy
I’m on some other shit, these fools playin catch up
I’m talkin' over their heads and check 'em from the neck up

Six time felon, get on his melon

Bounced out with the drum, di-di-dum-drum drum!
Shot him in his tongue with the hunting gun!
Blow-bap-bap-ba-budu-budu-bim!
Bow-bap-bap-ba-du-du-du! (UGH!)
They discontinued him, he’s no longer (He’s no longer)
No longer on the menu, he’s a goner (He’s a goner)
Now they partyin' and celebratin' like New Years Eve 2012
'Cause they got rid of the monster and cut off his tail (UGH!)
I play the game for what it’s worth (What it’s worth)
You put a hit on me, it’s gon’ get reversed (Get reversed)

But when I catch the boy in traffic, attack is gon’ be relentless
All over him with this Eagle that I got from the Desert

Let em know that this is grown man shit ya fucking with
Autoloaders, Hunting rifles ya fucking with
Somebody gon mind somebody shit ya fucking with
We give a fuck about who ya with and whatever horse ya rolled in on
Ya ain't finna take me outta my zone
Cause I'mma stay getting my money on and be about me and mine
Watch out for salty ass niggas during daylight savings time
Cause that's around the time of the year when the splitter splatter
Folks be losing the lives, they kidneys, and gall bladder
We in the stink of it man, me and my runners and gunners
We come through dumping with those autoloader turkey hunters
Never lose sleep, never worry, never weep
You could spend that time praying that what the preacher be speaking
Them suckas like to cheat, watch the beef say its kool
Them double back pull out them hammers and tools
And bettybye your them harrington riches and varmen rifles screws
For bragging rights, just to say he made the news

When the clouds is dark that means it's finna storm
If ya car is parked and the music is loud
That means ya setting off alarms in the crowd
When ya spider senses tell you that something is up
Then I suggest you go with ya gut
Don't ignore your first mind
Always pay attention to your warning signs
Always be awoke, always be aware, always look over ya shoulder
Always be alert of the rollers
When ya perking and ya sliding sipping Saint Ides or King Cobra
In ya scraper, feeling ya paper rubbing Donny Taylor or Clarence Carter
Alot Smarter than the average joe
Straight out the ghetto they call me E, 4, 0
Still hungry, still rapping like I'm still 'spose
Still money, still money on my mind folks

I survive in a drought, I sit on all my dope
And wait for the value to sky rocket
Make them client pay top dollars so when they come cop it

My doctor made me lose weight, my doctor said Charlie Hustle
We gon turn all this fat that you got into mustle
But fools gon think that I'm smoking, no they ain't loc
You got High blood pressure, the leading cause of death among black folk
Er' since yo ass was just a lil kid
The slave masters would give him all the left over and crap from the pig
Enough of that, I said what I said
Now let's get back to bussing heads
Know when to act a fool and who to act a fool with
Know who to be cool with and who not to be cool with

BEOTCH! Now...
Strictly mobb, strictly mobb
I might be rich and I rap, but sheeeyit
A hundred dollars worth of food stamps for $45 dollars
Nigga fat, I wasn't fin' to bite on that
I stay on stuff, fuck a cup, I likes to drink out the bottle
Mix Gordon's Gin with Donald Duck ?
 secure my novel
When, I was fifteen years old
Straight dope game, I was told
I had them hoes stealin clothes for me, boostin and sellin they body

We do cause trouble cause we dump on niggas

Down and Dirty, Federal, B-Legit the Savage, D-Shot the Shot Caller
My little sista Suga T Sprinkle Me on the money motivated mission
Tryin to have it In a Major Way after I was on the late night grind
Strapped with nines and Desert Eagles, me and my weeples
Come deeper than them skinny bitches, crept on us not too long ago
Sold our Lexuses and went back to the Cutlass Supreme
Buster demand they Zima's and forked toes
Starwise, with the helicopter knockoffs
My down South thugs call em elbows, turnin heads
With the personalized license plates with the tremendous bump
Fuckin they nose, fakin them domes
Breakin and shakin the neighborhood up, disturbin homes
Ridin on rims *tires peeling out*
Reyimmms, slidin through stopsigns, just like them action films
Watch me no cost to pay off my speeding tickets and fines
Giving myself up to the Elroy's
Doing time on the weekends, all up in the county writin rhymes

Some shit, some shit for you to smoke to

Make you stop at the liquor sto', and purchase some gin
Some shit to make a nigga Practice Lookin Hard
Some shit for all my folkers on the Boulevard
It's traditional, heavy ass shit for the mobb
I got more bass in my rock, than Third Eye Blind
Forty-Wata-Wata main don't tell me you gonna resign
It's too early for this, dude you in your prime!
I said -- no not me, I won't stop
I'mma do it for my nigga 2Pac
Sober see, that can't be
I been pervin all day since six o'clock
I pull a bootch like a bad tooth
With the cheapest EconoLodge a nigga like me can find
Drop her ass off out in the middle of nowhere next to a phone booth
Stranded freezin to death... empty handed can it
Stubborn hella hard to reason with
It's game orienfested, let me explain it
I know they say that I been, givin up too much game
But I'mma teach ya how to blossom with my new invention
You might wanna pay attention
I used to sell Kirby vacumn cleaners but I wasn't a punk
I worked at Mickey D's (what did you make) Employee of the Month
Livin above my means -- motherfucker that's a bald-faced lie
Po-po's raid, I got an alibi
Shot my first video for $20 bucks, motherfucker
Some cheap shit, Marriot's Great America

Pablo,"The Block Brochure: Welcome To the Soil, Pt. 4, 5, & 6",2013,"Just about anybody who used cocaine in the 90s and 80s
Was using Pablo Escobar's product
Escobar was probably the most violent
The most ferocious criminal that has ever lived
Money stacked up like Pablo
Peso after peso
You don't want to war with Pablo
They'll kill you when he say so
Touch down with it like Pablo
In Zone 6, I'm Pablo
Diamonds on my neck like Pablo
And the feds on my ass like Pablo

21 gun salute, R.I.P. Griselda Blanco
Peso, euro, all about dinero
Tailored suit like Pablo, time to sell this yayo
Guwop, call me Pablo
Box-load of bricks with a bar code
I could cook a dude something with a blindfold
Mail your head to your mama with your eyes closed
Pablo life, got them Pablo prices
And I'm keeping steady, so I'm Pablo icy
And the whole crew like it if Pablo like it
El Guwop drop trying to outsell Nike
Pablo, Pablo, Pablo, Pablo
It's silver or lead. Yeah, that's my motto
Young Scooter, my vato
Ferrari, my auto
Head honcho, house so big they think I hit the lotto

Telling is prohibited, snitches witness
Turn a blind eye and a deaf ear
You probably want to mind your business
Act like you can't see or hear
A-tisket, a-tasket
Now the fuck nigga in the casket
My money stretch like elastic
Serving that tragic magic
That nasal candy, that nostril dust
You don't really want to go to war with us
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Bringing in work in U-Haul trucks
Got more bags than Kris Kringle (Santa)
Puffing on a spliff of Bullwinkle (spinach)
Manipulate a broad with the lingo (slang)
She let me hit it we ain't even have to mingle (game)
All up in her panties like a single
Put it down like a Mandingo (beat 'em)
Having my chips like Reno (feddy)
Guns longer than the neck on a flamingo (thumpers)
If you're ready already, then you ain't gotta get ready
I'm out here selling that Becky, bout my chalupa, my feddy
Hoping the law don't catch me grittin' out here pushing that white
Serving fiends, smoking out of homemade pipes
I'm a thug from the mud, I've got the block in my blood
I'll take the top off the bottle and drink up all of the suds
Down and dirty bout mine, I'll put some cheese on your thoughts
Some bread on your head, no matter the cost, my

My big brother, the dope man
5 straps like Bruh Man
It's Pablo and the pimp man
Tax a bitch like Uncle Sam
Fuck niggas be like ""aw man""
Cause we young niggas and we getting it
And y'all niggas is jealous
Cause y'all niggas ain't getting shit
I say yes, nigga, indeed
I dress better than I read
Shine gold teeth when I chief
Pick your eyes up when I speak
Got that big ranch, real horses

Only talk big money, with real niggas
Y'all niggas too cheap

Escobar did not fear Colombian authorities
But he did fear American justice, and American prisons
When he could not get the law changed
To keep him from being brought to trial in the U.S.,
He tried to kill the lawmakers",https://genius.com/E-40-pablo-lyrics
Too Many,The D-Boy Diary: Book 2,2016.0,"Too many suckas in my huddle, too many bullets go through suckas
Too many born up in the struggle (too many)
Too many  youngsters out here trippin', too many po-po out here pickin'
Too many real ones in the prison (too many)
I pledge allegiance to the trenches
That I'ma always stay thorough
'Til death do us apart, health and sickness
Overcoming obstacles and hurdles

In the street we hold court, when we need backup
We call our folks for tech support
Get it?
Tec-support, we play with street instruments
Put a ho on life support
Put 'em in the dirt where haters belong, show no pity
God don't like ugly and he ain't too fond of pretty
I'm tired of servin' base, running in place
I wanna be a voice of hope
Make the world a much better place
I've always had mouthpiece, got the gift of gab
Gab in reverse spells bag
Back in the day I used to bag them bags
A pay-pay, and I ain't talkin' Safeway
Got the block sewed up just like a quilt
I thank the lord and I'm thankful I didn't get kilt
Life gave me a crap hand when it was dealt
Funkin' over nothin', hella blood spilt

Too many suckas in my huddle, too many bullets go through suckas
Too many born up in the struggle (too many)
Too many  youngsters out here trippin', too many po-po out here pickin'
Too many real ones in the prison (too many)
I pledge allegiance to the trenches
That I'ma always stay thorough
'Til death do us apart, health and sickness
Overcoming obstacles and hurdles

I'm not a pussy, I'm not a cat
People ask me where I'm from
I say wherever the money at
A lot a suckas is cancers, but not the Zodiac
A fungus, a germ, they'll stab you in the back
I don't trust no human, I barely trust myself
Especially when I get to drinkin' and smokin' on a spliff
Gettin' yayper is my chief concern
I ain't gonna do no ass kissin' if the tables turn
It is what it is, handle my biz
I give the shirt off my back to help the little kids
'Cause they the future not the past
Hire a tutor so they can pass
My folk's fresh out the joint, he doin' well
Learned how to weld in jail, he havin' mail
Instead of buyin' hella jewelry, bought a Care Home
Let his big sister run it, small business loan

Too many suckas in my huddle, too many bullets go through suckas
Too many born up in the struggle (too many)
Too many  youngsters out here trippin', too many po-po out here pickin'
Too many real ones in the prison (too many)
I pledge allegiance to the trenches
That I'ma always stay thorough
'Til death do us apart, health and sickness
Overcoming obstacles and hurdles

They tearin' the buildings down, they runnin' my people out
They boardin' the windows up and breakin' the glass out
It's ugly where I'm at, like where you at, it's goin' around
People killin' themselves, havin' financial meltdowns
I need a pastor in my life that ain't a hypocrite
That don't be  and tryna get a nigga bitch
I'm freak of these suckas tired of these bustas, damn right
Give it some time, what's in the dark gonna come to light
I'm immune to gunfire, on fire trucks when I sleep
Family in pajamas and robes in the street
Reward money, nobody told, nobody speaked
Sooner or later the information gonna leak
Block blocked off, hella yellow tape
Never knowin' it's your expiration date
Don't be soft, be real, don't be fake
Too many be tryin' to eat of the same plate
Biatch!

Too many suckas in my huddle, too many bullets go through suckas
Too many born up in the struggle (too many)
Too many  youngsters out here trippin', too many po-po out here pickin'

If my money ever got funny, I'd pawn my Walter Potter engagement ring
If I was to pass away tomorrow, with a self-inflicted wound to the melon
Just remember y'all, I had the mouthpiece of car salesman
Whomp beat of a gorilla, peel a cap back, to the tender fat
Put out a contract, bring you back your hats
Hypothetically speaking, not any time soon
Fly fittest finest player leakin, Daniel Boone boom BOOM boom
Creepin, fly right through your living room while you're sleepin

Tryin to have a stable full of, gregarious, clear bitches
Professional wonderful ladies of leisure, merrylicious
That'll get undressed at the drop of a dime at my request
And believe that, e'rytang I tell her to do is for the best
Ho you in violation, you in the red, wait a minute ho
You mean to tell me you tryin to jump camp
After a big ol' player like me done buttered yo' bread?
You free to go, I ain't gon' tell you no mo'
I told you twice, you'll be back cause you need, pimpin in yo' life
That's how you gotta get at these broads, you gotta check 'em
Man a ho'll walk all over ya if you let 'em

Street nigga man
You a street nigga bra

Hello

Street nigga, all my life i’ve been thuging heavily influenced by niggas that ain't got nothin
And these hoes don’t want no squares
They want a nigga that’s hustlin
Even though squares be having
Just as much paper than niggas husslin
But it’s me she loving cause i’m hecka known
And i’ll hella famous on my soil
You kind find me around my mama's house with a bottle of Crown Royal
With my car parked in the grass
Smokin a cross blunt light it up on 3 ends and it burns down to one
Nigga-rich everybody know my name
Yeah I’m havin a little bit a change
Known for serving blow see more snow than the X-Games
Trained to go, dreads braided like Lil Wayne
Keep a  hammer in my Fruit of the Looms or should I say Hanes

I’m a street outta here street nigga
These hoes love me but I ain't a sweet nigga
I’m a street nigga neva been a weak nigga
Solid as they come I’m concrete nigga
I’m a street nigga I’m a street nigga
Bring it to ya front door when i beef with you
I’m a street nigga I’m a street nigga
If you ain't out here in these streets i can’t eat with ya

When me and the dope game first walked down the aisle
One thing I vowed to do was to keep Ann Hill bail-spot and my lawyer on speed dial
Some these police be trigga happy light you up like a lamp
Just like they did with DJ Henry and Oscar Grant
I fucks with elegant broads and i fucks with tramps
Video vixens and hood hoes from different camps
Went from seed to a weed plant to a elbow
Kid on my way back from the little sto'
They seeing hot issue, hypodermic needles between they toes
Functional coke fiends keep a job and powder they nose
Selling chicken and turkey wings, quarters, halves and wholes
Plotting on jewelry, hanging out at the rap shows


I’m try'nna make more money on an accident than a lot of y'all do on purpose
Your squad is a couple of clowns short of a circus
My squad we golden and polished just like a turkish robe
30 odd 6 with kaleidoscope vision precision no competition
Fuck with OGs and those youngsters that don’t listen
Position them keys and I’m droppin em intermission
Go any soil i want any hood don’t need permission
Street nigga not a rap nigga this is the soundtrack of my life
Hood figure not a bitch nigga a fixture roll the dice
Trunk full a kid niggas in my whip and Harley bikes
Play a fixture for false and my folks will cut off ya lights",https://genius.com/E-40-street-nigga-lyrics

Fuck the middle man, we got the joog for cheaper (cheaper)
Ballin ass niggas got a choke hold on the game (on the game)
Let me take you down memory lane (memory lane)

From pushin bags of goop in the rain
Rockin up nostril dust
Me and my squad, my gang
Ain't never been no powder puff
Used to go to Puff-n-Stuffin the O-A-K
In a rental
Lucky's or Safeway
For supplies and utensils
But that's in the past, I'm havin my cash, rappin on instrumentals
I wanted to be number one
Not number 2 like the pencil
If it wasn't for my pen, I'd be in the pen
You can't know where you going if you don't know where you've been
Always been low key ADD, I couldn't sit still I move fast
It was impossible for a nigga like me to sit on my fuckin ass
I had to get that cash
Make my money pile
Build up my brand (what else?)
And boost up my profile
Made it out the game
Smellin' like a rose
From the bottom to the top
But I'm steppin on people's toes
Blast off , higher than the moon
Been a hustler, since I came out the womb
(biach!)


Man I take you way back, to tick tocks and two Jacks and New Jack's ""Who Dat""
Man got the goin on the cutty
And blowin up you beeper bitch, just to get my money
Then hit the state fair with about 6 or 7 buddies
You stay inside on task force Tuesdays
So what you don't sell dope, don't make this April Fools Day
This is the town of bedrock and cook rocks and new gats and who dat
They got a lock on the crack sack
Then baby girl starts screamin, where the Macs at
As soon as they came out, the broke bitch steps back
The fat laces in Adidas was religion
And Las Vegas nights taught us all about sinnin'
I let the weed burn, as I let the wheels turn
Gotta live well, groomed straight to the orbit room
Nobody there had job applications
Its three o'clock and gotta hit Nation's, memory lane


(oooahh)
I had a grenada, Disha had a mustang, Beela had a caddy
We was young in the game
Street niggas, young and ambitious
Determined to win, from start to finish
It's the drought season, way too vicious
Call me on the under mayne, hollin' at bitches
Haters didn't like it but they had to respect it
They quit the first family and rap to get a gold Lexus
Talk hurricane, but you can call me slur-a-cane
""Sprinkle Me"" mayne
""Captain Save a Hoe"" mayne!

Man I was in line when Scarface, hit the big screen
And if the dope was that good the people call it ice cream
You got paid off a pipe dream
And then first pair of Michael Jordan's, first hit the crime scene
You sat low when your team jack and waitin did
I forget to mention yo, they jack them for their gold Dayton's
Basketball we watch Gary Peyton
It's when drug dealers really sold dope, wasn't no fakin
We wore rings like straight Jamaican's
And yo the rap game was just getting started, for the straight takin
I reminisce yeah, but no pain
Cuz in the fast lane, the slow lane, the whole thang is memory lane",https://genius.com/E-40-memory-lane-lyrics

In the very very month of May
I seen three switchin bitches, that thought I had riches
Started walkin towards my way
Hangin out the sunroof of my Brougham Caddy-Mack
Ham sandwich with the BEEZ off in the back
I mah-uh-macked on one, but I slapped down two
Thoroughbred tenders like that, smashed out
Dabbed out, bust a pattern, leave em smokin
Just like Felix Mitchell and them used to do out there in Oakland
Major clout without a doubt like Clarence Carter I'll be strokin
Kick a bootch smooth up out my car if she get to actin like I ain't pokin

Now first of all before you correct me
I was pretty much already an established celebrity
Get my keys zack me cash off
Keep up in the game so heavily
But youse a stubborn, why in the fuck you complain?
I raised your ass bitch, brought your ass out the rain
When you was in the red, without a roof overhead
I helped your ass out, by puttin you in my bed
Around this time last year your ass was in the dark
And bitch, I'm out -- headed to the park

Where the alcohol and your broccoli at nigga I'm tryin to get my dick wet
Where the naked hoes? Where the big booty bitches? Yvettes and Susettes

Bow legged bitches with the bigger Gaps than the Band
Tell me a little bit about yourself bitch, tell me a little about your history
You done fucked around and made me mad, now I'msabout to talk bad

Heart like coal in the soul of a gangster
& I can make you famous
Better yet dangerous
Courageous, leave the game so contagious
Outrageous, amazin', I keep the shit blazin'
Can't nobody face 'em only money can persuade 'em
Bottles by the cases, models get wasted
Diamonds in my chain, some more up in my bracelet
Pocket full of paper

I Wanna Thank You,Tha Hall of Game,1996.0,"I wanna thank you, pimps and players
For sharing your game with me
I wanna thank all.. of the hustlers
For showing me your life, on the street
And I know (and I KNOW)
That'll I never forget you
Oooo-oooo-ooooh (that's real)
Forget about you (sprinkle me mayne, lace me mayne)
Ohhh-ohh-ohh

Ahh.. laced up by the best, check it out..
Uhh, marinatin on the corner with a chip in his phone
You can tell that the Hillside was his home
Mo' scrill than the rest of the pushers
Cause he got a chop suey in the bushes
Dice game, craps, puffin on Taylors drinkin Boilermakers
M.D. 20/20 mixed with Boone's, Farm's, and Olde English
Around the clock, deuce-four-seven, three-sixty-fifth
(??) where I come (??) DEAD RIGHT, twerkin over shit
Business boomin off the buzzer, and I'm a happy camper
Til the homey beat his bootch down for no reason with the Zenith hammer
Thangs started gettin sloppy, dude started rollin over
Niggas started steppin on dope and stretchin the crack synthetic yola
Turf got hot hella heads got shot on dead body soil
Po'-po's on that ass like hot baby oil
Play your cards right son everybody can have cash
But you gotta get in and out if you expect 'em to last


I was sprinkled at a young age
Laced down with Trump tight, taught by the best
Some of them still livin, some of them done been put to rest
But I was blessed, and luckily I made it out
But I must confess, I wouldn'ta made it without
The big timers, the top-hats, the tycoons
The street hustlers, the pistol packin Daniel Boone's
That put it down and paved the way, for me to say
The things I say, and I'm proud to be straight from the Yay
To U.K. I spits this big time talkin shit all day
Nationwide, from where I stay to where you stay
Be like the Savage beast, keep yo' game creased
Stick to the rules and don't be sellin out to no police
I always paid attention when the game was preached
Had all the street slang and the latest speech
And now I'm makin more mail than a oil well
Up all night tryin to get my money orders right


It started from my momma (yo' MOMMA?) Hard headed and all
She said, ""Only the strong survive, Suga STAY STRONG""
Seein a bunch of fools, that used to ride
Smob, stay jobbin knew they was raw
Without a pot to piss in
Used to drive through the turf in them candy paint Benzes
I've run all this game that the hustlers pop
Spittin enough game to keep a notch on the jock
Now the game's the same, but the players changed
Ain't nothin but a thang, keep it real mayne
Timer timer (timer timer)
Uhh, yeah, that's my nogga - sprinkle thee
Paper chasin steady flowin to the dome
It ain't no place like home, oooh oooh
Pay my respects and give my contributions
To all the soldiers on the streets and in the institutions


That right? Forty-water, from the C-L-I-C-K
With my sista Suga T
Lettin y'all know how we do it up in the Yay

That's the car I roll with
And it goes for all the hustlers nationwide

Hypnotized by the bad bitch with thick thighs

Hundred bands stashed in the mattress
Got four hoes like I did a hat trick

Like Taraji, she a boss chick
Kill the game, I don't take too many losses
All I know is green like I'm playin' out in Boston
Out in L.A. don't be doin' all that flossin'

Ballin' in the city like J. Clarkson

You say she bad, well, I don't think she flawless

My skrilla, my scratch, my dough
Corner boy rich, letting these suckers know
Got hella things to do, hella moves to bust, hella places to go
Got a lotta shit going on, looking for a warehouse to grow
My tree, legally, to sell to the weed stoppers
You see my folks got a garden in Mendocino

But now I live for the future
Record company owner (what's your position?)
Chief executive producer, unit mover

Lifted and splifted, whiskeyed and twisted

Makin' 'em mad, makin' 'em sad
Love to boast, love to brag
Slangin' them raps, selling these tracks

My amps is making my woofers pop

Make your car dance like a dance contest

Exciting, joyriding
High siding, big timing
Brand new shocks, 
rebuilt motor
What color paint is that? - Chocolate Mocha
Chrome lips, chrome tips
Chrome everywhere, chrome on my hip
Reputable, intellectual

Sticking and moving, reducing my prices
Adjusting my rates, bringin' new clients
Checking my traps, running my route
Collecting my snaps, peeling on out

Fresh back from the car wash fresh back from a bathe
When the sun hits my paint it turns a different shade
I ain't got time to be bullshittin' I got money on my agenda
I've been gettin bread since I came out of the placenta
Sevas in the summer time rallies in the winter
Side wood light skin big booty tender


I keep them bands on deck my mans on a jet
Some soft up on the block in a duce cutty drop
I remember when I copped back in '88
I set em on some straights filled the trunk with fosgates
And since I'm movin weight you know I couldn't wait
Brought that motor out the crate then I taught it how to skate
We turnin figure eights half and whole cakes
We take em on a chase We ain't tryin to take the case
Bitches know I'm fly got that vocal tone
And when they see me they be askin what I'm smokin on
I tell em cookies bitch you know I got that provolone
And you can call me on the under on my iPhone
You see me insides you know I keeps it stocked
And when I leave the block everybody stop and watch
You never know you might catch a sideshow
I lay that top back down and then I drive slow


Bitch this ain't my Bentley this my seven duce
TV deg W sevens press that big ole zeus
Matter fact I got a pair of those for dummies that means 2
My shit is clean as fuck but when I brought it it was through
I took it off the frame bitch this not a game
Got motor new suspension brand new everythang
Candy orange outside guts cocaine
Rims hella chromey see my face and my chain
New shoes on it 22's homie
And I would leave that bitch at home if I was you homie
Cause I'm a swing it sideways and slap to the trap
Off Patron and a zone with the zap on my lap

Once from the shoulder fist and plams
Instead shootin each other in the jaw
Now that they change the gun laws
I doubt it that’s like they askin these rappers
To stop braggin about they jewellery and money
It ain't gonna happen
Family can say anything to you like your feelings don’t work
But if you say something to them they get all but hurt
We living in a different time lucifer’s busy but he can’t win
Cause i got faith in god and the blood jesus over my skin
How comes everytime i turn on the news
The news refuse to show anything positive just only the negative
And the people i respect the most been lettin me down
Used to be solid as the ground now they be on this clown shit
Too old for this shit they not a leader they record conversations
And put ya on the loudspeaker and try to get you to murder mouth a dude
By talkin down on a dude so you can feel that it’s cool but it’s a set up
And suckas do anything for some tail
Try to turn a hoe into a house life that’s why 53.1 % of all marriages fail
And as far a road rage, you gotta be careful what you do
Cause you neva know what the next person is goin through

What kind of world are we living in
Jealousy and deceptions
Life lessons be so treacherous
I pray that god keeps on blessing us
What kind of world are we living in
Poverty and corruption
Blood stains is the evidence
I think i’ll write a letter to my president

He used to be a hitter
Backwards ass smile then he slowed his ass down
Cause he had his first child
Started goin to church a whole new environment
Till his bro bro got hit brought him out of retirement
You ain't gotta look for trouble cause trouble will find you
Even if you seasoned like barbecue or bar gumbo roux
These youngsters will try you and try to test your patience
But it take patience to catch a patient
Caught him slippy, slippy lean in the chevy box
Unloaded the magazine in his dreadlocks
Da da  dah that’s how that stick sounds
Da da dah feel somethang round
They wasn’t fuckin round knocked a nigga down
Left his brains in his lap and his sprite on the ground
Neva know who you really in business with, who ya nigga
Cause a hit could be cause a some paper or a favor

What kind of world are we living in
Jealousy and deceptions
Life lessons be so treacherous
I pray that god keeps on blessing us
What kind of world are we living in
Poverty and corruption
Blood stains is the evidence
I think i’ll write a letter to my president ",https://genius.com/E-40-what-kind-of-world-lyrics

Take it to the head everytime I’m on stages
Bottle of ciroc shawty i prefer the flavor
Red berry, coconut or we can do the peach
Shawty in my face saying can I get a drink, can I get a kiss
Can I get a hug, can I get a picture with you grabbing on my oww
Fuck it I’mma touch it let me do it for the flick

Called up ya friends up on facebook the lense is missing
If I take my jewelry to cash for gold I’ll probably get a million
Kept it a trillion we went out the trenches of cali
The flat lands and the alleyways we play with them AKs
The monsters they raised up out the V I’m a boss
I start havin steak and lobster with hollandaise sauce
Growing up in that new thang that Louboutin truck
Hella pea in that butter they say  I play too much
I see more keys than a Janitor pack more tools than a carpenter
Your bitch want me in her mouth like I’m a throat lozengers
We fucked on her mama’s couch nothing proper
Ratchet little chick I let her slobber
I proposed to my street sign when I was 9
I don’t see her as much as I used to but she still mine
I am the ghetto what you thought rewind
Bitch my ghetto past can never be declined
Fuckin with it I’m in it to win it like it’s the pin it skys the limit

The landlord not the tenant thinkin bout runnin for senate reinvent it

You try compromisin, nope - they don't wanna talk
And they got dem youngstas off that Acapulco powdered chalk
So he untouchable - oh he can be touched??
Well where he stay at then - he stay by such and such??
Well since we got altercations with these so-called knuckleheads
We gon' play for dooms
And I assume we get radar on fool in dem livin rooms
Bet - motherfucker ain't fin' ta be runnin around here drippin sweat
Havin hot flashes and shit
Over these fulla bitch-made and a half-ass dicks
You ripped? Let's take it to 'em sick
Hit all they spots at once - pour it on 'em thick
Who got the suey chops?? They in my folks garage
Well where he at?? He at the TravelLodge - BEEP THAT NIGGA!
Tell him to get here right now quick now it's gon' be some shit
Tell him to bring enough ammunition to blow up a ship
Bullshit ain't nothin this here been goin on just a little bit too long
Plus I got a family and kids to raise and I plan on seein 'em get grown
Get straight to the root of the problem
Get rid of the source that's what what
Get rid of the big cheese
And the majority of these niggas gon' back the fuck up
Somebody gon' mind somethin, time to validate my respection
Hit the corner dumpin, in the big-ass primered stationwagon
CATCH THEM BITCH-ASS!! That's what I told my driver man
While I was tryin to get him to get in a position
So that I could open fire
FUCK A SKI MASK!! I'm hot as fish grease
LET THE FULLY BLAST!! May he est n iss. Man, smash up outta there!
I brought them boys, but I shoulda brought it like a concert
Fool's still alive, John Muir Health, Trauma Center, Concord
Shoulda doused him, shouldn'ta never found him
Shoulda handled biz, but for now, it is what it izzzzz..
It is what it izzzzzz..
It is what it izzzzzz..
It is what it izzzzzz..

Aight, ay dude, this all I wanna know
What's wrong with this sad to be glad-ass noggas?
Don't they know that fools is laced with assassin skills?
Kill at will, gonna put your hat on the rack for a cool mill'?
(Awww it's gon' get done) but now the heat has been spared
How we gon' get him out of intensive care
And put him under the wing of a pall-bear?

One of my potnahs got a plug on some silencers, he knows some agents
He used dem (??) (??) shot on several different occasions
What that mean his family gon' boo-hoo when I smash that card
Better stay on a nigga brain give a FUCK ABOUT A DIE-HARD!
I know this one botch with a big-ass crotch by the name of Connie
She works in ICU and she dates this nigga named Mitchski Ronnie
Have nab him at the hospital, THAT'LL WORK
Paid a nurse to pull the plug on the LIFE SUPPORT
Risky business but it's organized class and the shit sound sharp
But if we fuck around and make it look too obvious
The broad might her lose her job
Tough luck that shit no better than fuckin for ME NOW
I gots no toilet paper feelings for her anyhow
The shit is crampin my livin style, floatin from telly to telly
Conspiracy murder plots phone conversations overheard by fedarale
I'm guessin fool musta passed away, tragic losses
On the wall they got my picture at the post office
After travellin bouncin back and forth to different states
They finally caught me up in Kansas City
At a barbecue spot called Gates
Do the crime do the time - it ain't for no bitch
And as long as a nigga twerkin in the kitchen, he ain't trippin
I'll be up in that bitch makin spreads, drinkin Pruno
Cocoa and coffee Cadillacs, jumpin jacks
Takin flicks, shootin kites, makin wishes
Fuck around and get mad on the strength of con-ju-gal vi-sits
Flip the weight pile, hit my fee-vee(?)
Keep my shank close by me when I'm slee-py
Shouldn'ta caught me, shouldn'ta never found me
Shoulda handled biz, but it's too late, it is what it izzzzz..
It is what it izzzzzz..
It is what it izzzzzz..
It is what it izzzzzz..

Oh, ohh I see
It is what it was, and what it was is just what's been taught

Struggling
Trynna get by, trynna get by, trynna get by...

It don't stop
Always runnin' from the cops
Pray at night, in the day they sell rocks
Gotta make it out, before we get popped
It's ugly trynna make it off the block

Crystal my religion, i'm tryn not to go to prison
Watch out ? it's murky, shoot with precision
My vision never missing, Winchester rifle ammunition
These double deuce thirds will go through your ligaments
We created a sequel despite our skin and our pigment
One day I hope to become legitimate
That's the thought process of a young hustler about his money
Far from a dumby smart enough to run with big company
If i was put in position the end results would be lucrative
No more life on the rough, livin life as a fugitive
Unregistered gun and marijuana smoke in my lungs
To decrease the stress
Got a vest and some olive oil that the pastor blessed
Then I take out the bottle, put it on my head and chest, to protect me from death
It's gruesome out here in this spooky ugly and murky
They dirty out here, they dusty scummy and certainly thirsty

It don't stop
Always runnin' from the cops
Pray at night, in the day they sell rocks
Gotta make it out, before we get popped
It's ugly trynna make it off the block

Second verse
You ain't no better than me
My sins ain't no worse than yours, only father thy god can judge me
I heard somebody say i'm sick of they urban gear
The dreads and the saggy pants, i had it up to here
You said ""why yall show your drawers and wear em down to here""?
I said "" why yall show your balls and wear em way up there""?
Contradictions and criticisms we trapped in the system
There's not a lot of schools but there's a lot of prisons
My big homie going through it man just like me and you
Hopin' and wishin' for a financial breakthrough
Comin' from where i'm comin' from you gotta be street smart and not dumb
Put your hands up... don't run
Cops will shoot you with they gun
Consequences, everyone makes mistakes
The difference btween today and tomorrow, is your faith
It's gruesome out here in this spooky ugly and murky
They dirty out here, they dusty scummy and certainly thirsty

It don't stop
Always runnin' from the cops
Pray at night, in the day they sell rocks
Gotta make it out, before we get popped
It's ugly trynna make it off the block

Third one
Tryna make it off the block, triangular markers and yellow tape
Bodies outlined in chalk
We be funkin' non stop
Warrin and beefin, tryna take off a top
We stressin depressin, nobody to answer our questions
The government treat us like peasants
Can't get a job nor reference
He really good people back in the day easy, had some scrill
Now he go to jail on purpose just to get a decent meal
Stop chasin his first high, he can get some get back
But he strung out, got that monkey on his back UGHHHHHHHHH
I see it all the time, What you see?
The people that help you the most be the ones you give the hardest time
Ain't that some backwards ass shit? Yeah it is
Act like you owe him somethin
And you don't owe him shit
It's gruesome out here in this spooky ugly and murky
They dirty out here, they dusty scummy and certainly thirsty

Thumper by my spine, out here pushin' a hard line

If you a sucker, man, then you probably lyin'

All across the map, rap shows and makin' G's
Livin' life to the fullest and celebratin' my legacy
Duckin' and dodgin' them bullets, man, some don't make it past 23
Refuse to be my own enemy, love the Lord and my family
Haters throw shade and they block my shine like a canopy
I made it out the cage, out the trap, up outta captivity
Stay in they face, on the case, they can't get rid of me

Smokin' the cone, I like to chief like I'm Tonto
I'm in my zone, almost at home, we on the phone
Talkin' hella grown, she say she tryin' to get it on
Make her moan when I bone when I run up in it

No color line when it was black and white TVs

Been in the game for a minute, got hella status and clout
I bought, it ain't rented, got me a mansion, a house
Soon as they get it, they spend it, that ain't the way I was taught
Put somethin' up for a rainy day, mama'nem use to say

A party everywhere

Pullin' up in the club about eleven
I place my feet and hit the beat and kept the engine revvin'
I got a lil' doja that I'm finna' to break down
Roll em' up in a zag, lick em' stick em' and clown
I'm fully dig with a fit, my game is on hit
I got tenders on my tip cause I'm livin' with this
Goin tight with the knack, and puttin' in scratch
Brothas better have a tight grip on they stuff, man, cause I'm bout to snatch
Ya botch and she loves it she'll be mobbin' up in the Cutlass
Puffin' on some of this chronic while I'm gettin' her straight pantyless
What about the drought season, they be lookin' for a reason
It's like Thanksgiving without the feastin'
Extra manish how I'm livin' and my name is groupie
It's Mr. 30-30 givin' up game to all you hoochies
Britches I be sportin' stone cold boots and sometimes Jordans
Saggin' and grabbin' my little pecker
Talkin' about sick on my gold better

I remember when crevice was hard to come by back in the days before I was in junior high
All they wanted to do is kiss and let me play with they vagina
I got my freshen up, I put on my chucks, hopin' some down with pluck
The finest botch on the playground, the one with the big ass butt
40 I love you, I miss you, I need you
In retrospect to who?
Batch come anew, batch come anew


Cause we makes like thugs
Get twisted in the parking lot before we go up in the clubs
Hugs and kisses, gotta make sure we got our gloves
Hugs and kisses, E-40, Kaveo and Young Mugz
Hugs and kisses, straight to the bar no time to waste
Kickin' em' back while they take the place
Order me a shot of that nuclear waste
Thinkin' they about to beat my face
Oh no, I'm nothin' but a professional
Oh no, we're nothin' but professionals

Hoochies all in my face with some of that dope water
Brothers already pervin off some of that swamp water
So I'mma make a toast to the most
Mobbish lookin' brothers in the citay midnay
Cause brothers gotta get the shit that's really gidnay
Batches on our jock, batches on our jock
We might have to throw thangs to these brothas
That's a Captain Save a botch
They wanna be like the big boys and sport big boots
They wanna be like the big boys and sport triple X suits
I got love for D-Boys cause D-Boys got love from me
I got love for D-Boys cause D-Boys got love from me
I got love for D-Boys cause D-Boys got love from me
I got love for D-Boys cause D-Boys got love from me


We in this baby boy pervin'
E-40 N' the Mossie
And I'm still down with The C-L-I-C-K
Comin' yo way in the 94'
The 95', it don't stop boy ain't no jive
Sell the rest of them tapes boy
Where the deposit at, where mine at

Michelin Star restaurants, Cohiba cigar blunts
Front row seats at the UFC fights, first class flights
Homeowners Association fees and property taxes
Earthquake insurance just in case something collapses
Wholesale license and DBA's
Selling alcohol by the truckload, selling liquor by the case
Record labels and streams, billion plays
One day I'ma own a baseball team, the Giants or Oakland A's
Growing up in the struggle, you gotta be wired right
Can't be snitchin' and tellin' on fellas like a vice
Gotta be made for hustlin', know your weaknesses and strengths
Gotta go with your heart and your gut, trust your instincts
When I was growing up they taught me all the rules
Never put your right foot in your left shoe
I was a quiet dude, I never gave a clue
Gotta watch this dude 'cause I'll do somethin' to you, bitch

Kudos to my inmates in them fire camps
Programmin' and doin' they time like some champs
Reading books and eating healthy with no pork
Cardio, push-ups, and bar work
My uncle used to always tell me, ""Nephew, go for it""
Don't be tryna buy it if you know you can't afford it
If the good Lord bless you when you come across a check
Say, 'Thank you, Jesus,' show some respect
Keep quiet as it can be, careful, don't flamboast
They'll run through your pockets, take off your clothes
They'll mix you, they'll kick when you out cold
No matter the age, young or old
Livin' out here in the sludge where they hold a grudge and they bust
7-point-6-2's and double eye bucks
I'm from Vallejo, California, the Yay
Startup company, Seed A, bitch

So many catastrophes, so much stress
Where elementary teachers get paid less
Watch your surroundings, stay ready, and pack a gat
When you're washing your clothes at the laundromat
The closest ones to you will set you up
Give you up for a couple of bucks
Break bread with the enemy, split the worth
Then go to Neiman's and purchase a man purse
Life is too short, so wasn't no plan to live long
Sorrow and hurt, the mamas cry on the phone
Face on a shirt, they can't afford a tombstone
Ain't nobody home when you ask for a loan
Gotta watch 'em 'cause they quick
Go in the gas station and get bipped
Break your car window, take your belongings
Your backpack, your laptop, and all your earnings, bitch

I get my ride on the HumVee, walkin through the party
Puffin on chronic and drinkin on Bacardi
Gotta represent Cali and bang 'til death do us
Throwin the haters off and keep our folks next to us
For me to bust a Bay bitch she gotta be the thickest
I dig them Bay niggas cause they Sic'Wid'It and Click-ish
Like that there nigga, re-cop from Mack Diamond
Pop a collar one time, let me know you're still timin

I'm a Bay nigga, all in L.A. nigga
No matter what you say nigga, long as you pay nigga
I figure - you want it bad enough, you gon' take yo' shit
A steel toe mack down to break yo' bitch
And she cain't be fixed, so what if she yours?
We turn housewifes to everyday whores
Send 'em up in stores with the false ID
To get DVD's and big screen TV's
Wanna be like me? I run from vice
Catch a out-of-towner and I'm takin his ice
Throw him in the trunk with the bag and the mice
I know it ain't nice but nigga that's life
Black black on the scratch, no tradin back
2000 'llac, can you fuck with that?
Me, Mack, 40, Shot and Bosko
All strapped down with the roscoes

Here I come.. steppin out the Vader
They call me D-Shot and I'm about my paper
Been in this game since eighty-six
One of the first bosses to hit the independent lick
Y'all know my dawgs is the C-L-I-C-K
Them true boss ballers that done paved the way
I throw my Roley up in the air
It cost me 25 K, do you think I care?
I rolls bodies, as thick as you can get 'em
You know them 600's with the V-12 emblems?
The rap game's been good to me
I like the money and the hoes and the V.I.P
The lavish lifestyle that I live
Consist of big-ass parties and sippin gin
We puff trees, we smoke 'em by the ounce
We hit the studio and then bounce


See I'ma, street walker, gun clapper
Papered up hood nigga livin like a rapper
If you see me you would think I sold a million copy
Like what's-her-name? Ice all on my body
All kind of bitches be thumpin over a motherfucker for the worst
One of 'em got a pair of ?? school college scissors in her purse
Ready to take off on a nig', take a nig' (beatch)
Stab a bitch, shoot a nigga for her nig'
See I'm a slick talkin boss playa
Full of straight mindgames and schemes
Find your botch's weakness, get off in her jeans
Tell her she's the sweetest, pull her mental file
See if I can help cause she's livin in denial (bitch)
You liable to find me on the ave, slangin o's
Parked on the curb, sippin white Irish ross
Smokin herb, grindin in my dirty clothes (what else?)
Hella perved, standin on my P's and toes


I'm sportin Benzes, Cutlasses, smoke trees and hustle for G's
Pop game that pertain to plenty, shoppin sprees
Magic shows, gatherings and ceremonies
What's your testimony? Ain't nuttin bout me phony
I'm a boss bitch botch
Known for smugglin heroin balloons in my crotch
Beat a bitch down with copper pennies in a sock, I be on the block
Teasin on the dicks, doin nigga shit

We're ballaholics everyday
We're not your ordinary niggas
Our only motive is to get paid

Being broke ain't nothing funny
Let's take a trip outta town

I rap and I rhyme but so far that ain't made me a dime
I'm sick of my mama flippin' pattys working at Maggies commin' home cryin
On the weekend workin part time stressin' and prayin'
It's goin be alright mommy I put that on me
I'm a start sellin tree cause it's less risky
Went and got a cannabis card so the popo can't frisk me
Goin hard on the yard rollin my sleeve gettin down and dirty
Amtrackin it outta state and city to city
Greyhound bussin it seal it and tuck it in my booty
Got pills, windshield and elbows of broccoli

Pisces got the prices dope be da nicest
Niggas cop cakes and cut them into slices
Then we get vices feds and the task force
I can teach you how to get it, crash course

Put em on the ground see you in about a week
The only way to eat keep your money in the streets (ya)

Arizona Mex fuck tha border up
They even get across if they sorta tuff
You gotta know who to trust that's important stuff
California grown what you knowin good
And they be blowin that up in the back wood
And they be coppin that if the scratch good
All you gotta do is just give it to the neighborhood


I give it too ya
I got tha tracking number tear the paper up when it lands
Quick notha hunned in tha rubba band it's never enough
Just feedin 5 (5) on the wake up touch wherever you desire
Them niggas pack was quiet I came with all loud
Mama didn't know how tha money came she was proud
I open doors in a small town avoid snitches
Bounce back like trampolines when work missing (GET IT BACK!)
Is you lookin for a way in or way out
Credit good real niggas never see the drought
Shot the game to my lil nigga cause he tha driver
Minivan got 10 cakes on each tire

All up in the joint, man, singin', chattin'
Talkin' that old really fu-fu riff-raff-ass shit, mayne
Speakin' on every nigga in the muthafuckin' dope game
He's scared like a mice
Po-po's talkin' about 25 to life
But real niggas do the time and pay the price, though
Rat heads give up game to the vice, you know
Trick sap wanna hang hisself like a dick
Just because he got popped with a half a zip
Chow time, niggas rush for the vittles
But rat head wants to the talk to the po-po's
Get me outta here, dude, I'm losin' weight, stressin'

Popo's gives up no slack, all through the dope tracks
Lettin' this shit really be known, jack
To get a bit too far, kind of ridiculously
Handed the rat some money, and said, ""Now you work for me""
He was all for the scratch, see, and just like a batch, G
The nigga played the role of a pussy
Little old pank, crevice-faced faggot
Nigga sold out, and now he wears a snitch jacket
On the turf they wants to get with his PG
But it'll draw too much heat, so they wait patiently
He won't be seen no time soon
'Cause in the V-Town he's doomed
Packed up and straight cut to Suisun
Got in the good with all the hoods and thugs
Expressin', ""I'm from the V-Town, dude, 707""
Niggas and bitches was trippin' and shit, havin' a fit
He said, ""I even know E-40 and the fuckin' Click""
They damn near shitted, boss
Not knowin' that the nigga was lyin' his ass off
Meanwhile, back in Vallejo

Nothin' but ballers from different towns
A house full of Nino Browns
Shootin' pool, playin' craps and dominoes

RRRRAP for free, nigga FUCK the hype
BEOTCH! You gotta pay me just to BREATHE on the mic
High, higher than a dust cloud
Hella disrespectful, all up in the party talkin loud!
Systemized, a triple striker, when I was born
My mom and daddy shoulda named me Isiah cause I'm a Rider
Sole survivor, Hillsider, 1400 block Magazine Street
Narcotic ? bomb preparer heroin provider
I'm vicious, mean mugged and mad doggin niggas like the
Like the Grinch Who Stole Christmas
I like to, like to, finger fuck bitches up in clubs
Take her home and get rug burns on my nuts!
Stuck! Gordon's Gin and Donald Duck
NUT! All on her spine and on her butt
FUCK! Major clientele (major clientele)
Then I pass it to my nigga Mista Jayo

? up the glass is shatterin, bitch it ain't matterin
They scatterin, see me and forty start splatterin
The cowards are heartless, so you burn like flames
Niggas that got snake eyes get broke up like dice games
Fuck a bitch, why? Cause skeezers don't please us
So I just go around sippin fine wine like Jesus
And everytime I bust a spit it's a hip-hop quote
Drinkin Moesha Brandy, head spinnin like hundred spokes


Still drinkin Krypton
Brothers is Snapple then I snap like a snapping turtle
Nigga, shittin on the world keeps my land fertile
I grow my own shit, fruits, vegetables and tobacco
It's third down and forty nigga
You know you gon' get tackled
Get your land while you can old man
Niggas so dope they named me twice like Duran Duran
Killa nigga put honey on em, and feed em to my hogs
See I leave no evidence for the police dogs
Now off the low stroll we go so let's flow
Lil' bitch, we the shit because the people said so
You can't tell a lettuce from a cabbage silly rabbits
Get these chips even if it means lettin these motherfuckers have it!

Nigga got out of line, I had to ice him
Reached into my drawers, and pulled out my strap
Motherfucker got out of place, I had to chop him
Reached into my d-da-da-das and pulled out my strap, check it out
Nickle plated chrome planet Clint Eastwood special
Designed strictly for staplin and toe taggin
Po-Po wrote me up a citation cause I was saggin and draggin
My b-ah-bitch, by her w-uh-weave
I had to, I had to make the bitch bleed! Last New Year's Eve
She tried to hit me with a fryin pan, my attitude wasn't carin
Backslapped that ho in front of her parents
More ki's than a janitor
It gets mannisher and mannisher and mannisher
Smokin on a roach, loitering in a McDonald's parkin lot
Throwin up gang signs
To ? as if he was some kind of first base coach
I luh I like my egg poached, hard over easy!!!
In the drive through, hollerin at her breezy!!!

Seven houses down, black street, dark (?) folk don't matter tho'
I don't know who to trust, what to look fo'
How many niggas wanna kill me?
I'm havin a, hard time tryin to determine
If that's the homey, or the enemy
Ol' shady-ass, no build for that
Just lookin like he plottin on somethin-ass nigga
But I wanted to mack like he fin' to do somethin
And I'll get to be dumpin on yo' ass nigga
One of the main rules, of the game, without a doubt
Nigga don't you ever pull a gun and don't use it
Nigga that's a good way to get your brains blow out
Motherfucker like me get to flashin then I lose it
Leave that ol' shit up to me and watch me prove it
Nigga, you betta be real about this shit
If you in it you in it don't be no punk
Nigga this ain't no baseball game, niggas don't FORFEIT NO DAMN FUNK

Two brothers goin sack for sack
In the back of the 'llac, takin a whiffle
Strippin the fuck up out of some willow
Poppin ecstasy like Skittles
It'll get you in the long run, sniffin them long ones
Way girl burst ya dick and now it got ya on one
Came up shorted, circumstances nigga quote it
What goes around comes around tryin to steal this (?) Brady hostess
Keep your focus, and never the love of the hocus pocus
Set up hoes lovin to get jackers to come and smoke us
Die-hard soldier, T-Pup-alicious, cops get vicious
No mercy on haters or no bitches
Got in my clitches waitin for a nigga to take some chances
So we can deal with these hardco' Sic-Wid-It-ass circumstances

Takin all these CHANCES
You might never ever ever get them CIRCUMSTANCES
Penitentiary CHANCES
You might never ever ever get them CIRCUMSTANCES

I said the world is full of crack babies
I remember when the world went crazy
Til I copped a sack, and put it down like that
And rolled out like it didn't even fade me

Nigga - slang suga delight enough to get my hustle right
It's double like, a flip new Benzo with the bubble lights
Scuffle fights with rats and roaches, I was the brokest
Motherfucker, now I'm the closest nigga to ballin ferocious
Motherfucker, dust a nigga off like wax off, cracks off a hard
(Fo' sheezy) Pimpin ain't easy and motherfucker only if you breezy
Easy does it, I does it do it off the fluid
Come with the newest shit I come through with
Bitch don't you hear the music?
(Don't you hear the music? Too sexy for my shirt)
Too sexy for my shirt so bad hurt
Niggas on the turf wanna put my ass up in the dirt, cause I skirt
A Lex-o and slurp a genie bottle full of X-O
Or maybe cause I'm with 40-Water and a jug of ethel
You can't love it, don't leave the ghetto
Me and I'm heated like two jugs of methyl

Damn, (??)cydal shit when vital shit starts to happen
Eager to be the nigga just for cappin
Strappin up ain't no thang, it's survival
It's makin sure you all good when it comes to enemies and rivals
It's +Higher Learning+, but it's +True Lies+
When it comes to the +Superfly+
Speedy Gonzalez destroyes from the Eastside
Is it ridicule or stardom? Did we hurt yo' feelings, pardon
I'm makin niggas fall like cops on +Rage in Harlem+
(Beotch!) I'm on some moonshine shit
Bit the cork off the Cristal
I'm drunk so let me chill for a while



Aww yeah yeah now niggas know
Well ain't no sense in me fuckin around
My stompin ground be the H-I-double-L-S-I-D-E bound
To touch you with them tecs and make them marks, bounce like checks
Slide a faulty bitch up under these niggas
And killin 'em off with sex
Ain't no tellin what angle I'm comin with these circumstances
Penitentiary chances, nina ruff fluffin tap dancers
On your hood for breedin snitch bitch-made niggas
Don't fade triggers so they quick get sprayed niggas
I fuck with wig-splitters, Colombian neck-tie throat slitters
(??) take a long time business to get paid
To get rid of you cheater
Chatter police-ass niggas takin chances (takin chances)
Man you can't fuck with these circumstances

And all you O.G. motherfuckers better stop tryin to mark them yungsta
Cause sooner or later, they gon' dump, like some garbage dusters
Tryin to throw yo' weight around

Born in the Struggle,Revenue Retrievin’: Overtime Shift,2011.0,"And so then the question becomes: How do we try to educate and teach and exemplify in our own lives as older folk to young folk there are other ways of dealing with this? Then there's a large issue of crime. How do we go about fighting crime? And it's towards this preferential treatment between the poor and the rich, end up with prison disproportionate black, brown, working class poor brothers

I had to hand-wash my clothes, didn't have a washing machine or a dryer, UH
Mama used to have to hang her period panties out on a clothesline wire, UH
The vacuum broke, used the broom
We got company coming over this afternoon
You know our family like to gossip
Clean up your room, throw everything in the closet
I like to talk to the old schoolers, O.G. playas
'Cause they was my age - I ain't never been theirs
I count on em for guidance, leadership and advice
'Cause everything I'm goin' through they done been through twice
Or three or four times, five, six, seven, eight
We can learn from they mistakes before it's too late
Communication is everything, conversation's abandoned
People die every day because of misunderstandings
The highs and lows, the ups and downs
Pissy sidewalks, human shit on the ground
The ins and outs, whys and won'ts
History repeats itself, opportunities don't
Sad true story, unintentionally, not on purpose
Only time I see my family's at a funeral service
Her stomach keep hurting, but she didn't bother
'Cause you and I both know that black folk don't like to go to the doctor
One thing about us, mayne, we creative
And at the end of the day we all related
Through the slaves and the Indians and natives
They brought us here on a boat, whipped us and raped us
Scraps from a pig they gave us
So we cook pork chops, chitlins, ribs and bacon
Fucked around and got addicted swine, which wasn't supposed to be

I was born in the struggle, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
I was born in the struggle
Yeah, our life it gets harder, the youth, they die younger
The time we get's harder, it's just what we're used to

OOOUH!
You got a ride to school, I had to walk
We had Rent-a-Center furniture, yours was bought
Paid for, your parents had more
You had a bed to yourself, I had to share mine with four
Sometimes I slept on the floor, that's probably why to this day
Sometime my back be sore, UGH, hard times
We was borderline poor, far from being the richest
If we didn't do our chores, we would get beat with switches
Born in the struggle where we all wanna bubble
Where it's hard to do good but easy to get in trouble
Can't be soft as table butter, can't be no punk
And every neighborhood be havin' their own internal funk
Boarded up houses, unsafe sex
Teenager at the bus stop smoking meth
Good girl gone bad, weak-minded without a doubt
Her parents didn't find out until her teeth fell out
Oil stains in the driveway, church on Sunday
Every time I go, seem like the preacher preaching to me
Pointing at me, looking at me
Heaven or hell, mayne, which one it's gon' be?

I was born in the struggle, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
(I was born in the struggle, yet I was born a Black man)
I was born in the struggle
Yeah, our life it gets harder, the youth, they die younger
The time we get's harder, it's just what we're used to

Ooh, sometimes we sit back and watch things go by
Like that's the way they're supposed to be
No no
This ain't how it was meant to be
(This ain't how it was meant to be, mayne)
Turn around, look at your neighbor, ask somebody
(How cold is it?)
It's cold, cold, cold out here
(And what you talkin' 'bout?)
And I'm talkin' 'bout the weather
(Say it one more time, bruh)
I said it's cold, cold, cold, cold out here
(It's cold out here)
And I'm talkin' 'bout the weather
(What was you born in?)

I was born in the struggle, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
(Ooh, I was born, I was born, I was born, I was born, in the struggle)
I was born in the struggle
Yeah, our life it gets harder, the youth, they die younger
The time we get's harder, it's just what we're used to

Dr. Cornel West, talk to 'em

Young folk don't come out of the sky, they come out of families, they come out of neighborhoods, they come out of mass media influence and so forth, you see?

I want... your LOVE. (x2)
(Verse 1)
Check game
Paper in my pocket, not lint
Got a house note not rent
Dual exhaust sound like a dog barking
Cutlass Oldsmobile, Platinum Kush sparking
At the intersection making hella noise
Car got bass like Barry White voice
Underneath my seat...HEAT
4 G auto slippers on my feet
Hit the liquor store for some alcohol
Earl Stevens wine and some Buzzballz
Walking out the door I see a super thick
Orange bone thicker than my other chick
Every day I celebrate life
You only live once, not twice
Put the good lord first, not second
That's the only way you're gonna get to heaven
Breathing is a blessing every time I wake up
When I'm at the barbershop, I got my pistol tucked
Ready for whatever, just in case
I gotta put a sucker in his place
In the dirt with the worms and the maggots
My pinky ring got a bunch of baguettes
Standing on the couch in the club
Like the homie Pac say...Give me LOVE!!!
(Chourus)
I want your LOVE...I want your LOVE
Like the homie Pac say...Give me LOVE!!!
(x2)
(Verse 2)
Everything on me brand new
First thing people look at is ya shoe
Bosses everywhere in my crew
We hella deep...deep like the Wu
Worry about your own paper route
Mess around and stretch yourself out
Groveling and complaining... hella grumpy
Trying to count the next player money
I can see right through a sucka like a vodka bottle
Trying to stack paper... taller than a supermodel
I am on this Mangoscato
It go hella hard, not soft like a soft taco
It's the weekend, and even if it ain't
We gonna paint the town and put some paint where it ain't
At the ???, I gig like a gangster
Just to let you know, keep one in the chamber
(Chorus)
I want your LOVE
I want... your LOVE
Give me LOVE!!!

(Verse 3)
Third verse, 41st bar
Raised in the gravel...brought up on the tar
Word played like Scrabble...microwave pickle jar
In the middle of the ghetto, might slap box spar
Used to step on a crack, but I wasn't superstition
Now they got cameras, and face recognition
Gotta be careful on the street
Helicopters can see through body heat
I'm sitting on the couch smoking a bowl
Slapping classics like this that touch the soul
Watch what you say to ya heathen
Never know when you might need em
Be a father to your son or your daughter
Be a man, not a damn coward
Might be a judge or rap or play sports
Attend they games, pay your child support
Most gifted people on this earth, can be right in your presence
Diamond in the rough, by their selves
Back of the bus...by choice not force
Real once cuz, embrace, endorse
I love people...not things
That's probably why I always see snakes in my dreams
When you see my family...give them a hug
Tell them all I ever wanted was they LOVE
I want your LOVE
I want... your LOVE
Tell them all I ever wanted was they LOVE...Give me LOVE!!!

I worship the Bible, Jesus Christ my savior
Show me where in the Good Book say I can't smoke a Taylor

I spit it from the heart with my right hand on my chest
Every time I take a breath, I know I'm blessed

Some of the people that's poor don't ever stress
You only live once, I think I heard 'em say
And you only die once, my grandpa used to say
Love and hug ya friends and next of kin

Then buy a pack of 'woods at the liquor store
Them boys in the hood tryin' to make that dough
Wish a nigga would like a two by four
Nigga you a square, I'm a triangle
Got more fur than an Eskimo
When it comes to hustlin' bitch, I'm the go
Meet me at the parking lot at Trader Joe's
Re-up and re-cop on the holiday
But not Easter or Christmas Day
Watch out for the cops when you push that yay
Livin' out here in this dirty Bay
BIATCH!

She hit me on my locker, I was off that Tropicana orange juice and Absolut vodka
Smokin on a beadie, chasin it with a fat Strike in my
Fresh off the showroom flexin 32-valve Northstar Caddy
Gettin it cricket, slangin em sideways, walkin up the streets
Residuals, re-enactments, constantly repeatedly burnin Vogues
Flamboastin, high-sidin, turnin heads, REWINDIN!
Ain't had the car but two weeks and already need a wheel alignment!
See us Bay negroes is nigga-ain't-give-a-fuck
Flip a spankin new vehicle, tear it up
We play mind games with tizzy airhead ass hoes, make em
Buy us things like diamond ear-rhings and clothes, a, uhh

But just remember Charlie Hustle always told you so

Smoke grey exterior, convertible ragtop Hummer (To da beat!)
Little homey ain't but sixteen years and a millionaire
Sittin on somethin clever talkin about, ""40 Water can you help me out?
Can you give me some kind of advice
Cause I ain't tryin to be up in this bitch forever?"" (To da beat!)
Told all my motherfuckers to try to wash they monies
And make some kind of good out of bad, buy you a couple of fixer-uppers
Shit it ain't gotta be no brand new Caddy (To da beat!)
Use da dope game as a stepping stone, let your little sister run it
Turn one of the fixer-uppers into a care home, I'da done it (To da beat!)
Where I'm from, Vallejo California born and raised in crew
We got the highest paid police force, look what they do (To da beat!)
Too busy tryin to scrutinize and slander me
As much as I done did for the community (To da beat!)
Do me a favor why don't you go out of state and go visit
Some of your family members down South and mention Vallejo
And I bet the first thing that come up out their mouth
Is Earl Stevens and Denell, bump this shit til your tape break
And youse a bitch if you didn't buy my last tape, BEOTTCH!!!!

You can pat that nigga down with a metal detector
And still not have a clue
Fools be slidin up in parties on crutches
Limpin, with a derringer in his shoe (To da beat!)
Fuck a Cuban cigar, give me a Black N Mild
Then watch me tear up a brand new hundred dollar bill
And throw it in the crowd (To da beat!)
I don't need no iron, I'm already crisp -- whatchu got whatchu got
Whatchu got -- I don't need no money, I got mouthpiece (To da beat!)
Closed mouthtank get fed, dude what you talkin here, what
All of a sudden you got amnesia nigga

Get it in the mornin' cuz I'm so serious...
Get it in the mornin' cuz I'm so serious...
So serious mane... Listen up...
If you a true hustler man, fo' real, you gonna bounce back if you got give back skills...
Fuck all that weeping and whining and crying pissing the bed...
Im'ma make it do what it do...
Get out and get my grits...
I'm on that graveyard shift...
My water bill past due...
Hustlin' tryin' to stay focused...
Got a 24-hour notice on my door...
Business is slow...
I speak the truth...
Blood pressure out the roof...
A long way from being recession proof...
I'm going through...
I ain't tryin' to be a dead beat dad...
I want my kids to have a better life than I had...
My cellular off... need some more minutes over my limit...
Had the money but bought an ounce of weed thought I could flip it...
Man I'm niggerin' cuz that's what some of us black folks do
Instead of paying the bill we gonna buy the new Jordan shoe...
Milk and diaper and baby wipes cost an arm and a leg...
A breast a wing and a thigh...
Hustlin' trying to get by...
Don't underestimate me a couple of days is all it's gonna take me...
Cuz I'm so serious it go like that I drop it off and it come right back...
I get it in tha mornin'...
Don't underestimate me a couple of days is all it's gonna take me...
Cuz I'm so serious it go like that I drop it off and it come right back...
I get it in tha mornin'...
I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired of being broke...
I'm sick of this sequel...
Man I swear I  brought down on my luck...
Ain't got a buck to my name...
Dirty, testing, pissing in a cup...
What tha fuck...
They found weed in my system...
I told my girl I was quittin'...
They send me back to San Quentin...
For 90 days...
Did my time and got out...
Now I'm in the unemployment line tryin' to figure shit out...
But the penal system got me by the neck 
With my troubled past I can't even get me a job...
My partner rap...
He got his own record label...
They doin' their thing...
If I holla at them maybe they can shoot me some change...
Plus I'm a loyal nigga... man I learn quick bro... I ain't stupid...
All you gotta do is show me one time I can do it...
My fellow put a hustler under his wing showed me the game...
Now I'm doing my thang...
Don't underestimate me a couple of days is all it's gonna take me...
Cuz I'm so serious it go like that I drop it off and it come right back...
I get it in tha mornin'...
Don't underestimate me a couple of days is all it's gonna take me...
Cuz I'm so serious it go like that I drop it off and it come right back...
I get it in tha mornin'...
I'm trying to stay out of trouble and triple double quadruple...
This little change that I got by throwing a few concerts...
But I'm not too sure if I'm ready to spend this mayo...
The reason these rap shows don't always go that well...
And the chances are that I probably won't recoup...
So I'm gonna take this loot and book some old school R&B soul groups...
That way the venue insurance won't be that high... And...
Plus I'm minimizing the chances of somebody dying... That's right...
I got a homey that work at the toll bridge...
He make good money, plus he get benefits...
He been hollerin' at me never-the-lesson...
Tryin' to get a nigga a job there...
Which is a blessing...
But I don't think the homey really understand...
I'm an entrepreneur man I ain't workin' for no white man...
Attitude of a hood boy...
All my life I been running from the elroys
Don't underestimate me a couple of days is all it's gonna take me...
Cuz I'm so serious it go like that I drop it off and it come right back...
I get it in tha mornin'...
Don't underestimate me a couple of days is all it's gonna take me...

Four funerals this week, playin have no sleep
We were all supposed to meet, but niggas nowadays they cheap
Gotta stay wit yo heap, gotta stay wit yo squeeze
Ma name ain’t Tyler Perry but I pack pistols like Madea
Then they get egg on bread, but they ain’t put cheese on tha pizza
They on tha boy head, like some stripes on a zebra
With so many out here in d pain, don’t think that it’s cute
40 you live in d burbs, playa how you stay in d loop
I done seen it an lived it an done it, niggas don’t want it
I keep it 100 not only dat but I’m from it
Some a you suckaz can’t tell a prune from a pulp
A crawfish from a prawn, a lake from a fuckin pond



Put it a yowder up in d pot, let it simmer an bathe
Put a little bit a water an arm an hammer to let it foam like aftershave
I like to serve ma work west so it weigh a hella lot more
You can smell d residue an d fumes from next door
When it comes to cookin I’m a pro, a chemist from head to toe
Everybody know where I’m from, the lighthouse
I don’t tell ma brawd too much cause you know dese brawds can get messy
They turn when they mad an call d law whenever they ready
Gotta be sharp like a machete, solid not bitch may
Saucy like spaghetti, one day ima get saved
Right now I’m havin fetti, tryna maintain ma title
On ma knees prayin every night, readin ma Bible
Lookin out fo’ rivals, sleepin next to ma rifle
Olive oil on ma forehead for ma survival
Drinkin ma worries away in dis human zoo
Tryna bust up out dis cage ma ninja dats what it do



Get up yo ass an stop playin (get ya weight up)

(Let's go Turf!)
Polo, everything, they should endorse me

Man I might be the hardest we got
And yeah I'mma get this money regardless or not

Talkin 'bout ""family you changed""
I'm like #YouBeinALameBreh!
Get out my way; hey it's too many hoes up in this thang
For a nigga to be all in my ear tryin to kick it like Liu Kang
This shit bang! It's slappin like domestic problems
My brother Fresh Al got that look like don't mess with potnah
I'm swagged up, big horsey on my shirt!
Match the L.V. on my shoes, niggas better guard they work
I'm turnin P.I.'s to heckler ho protectors
Better look down, cause if I see eyes, girl I'm fin' to check her
Went all through her purse like Frank Gore for the first
Niggas be actin like they hard, but they really just be nurse
Puttin niggas on mack blast like, breh you gotta prove it!

Nice Guys,Revenue Retrievin’: Night Shift,2010.0,"Nice guys finish last and stay broke
Bad guys finish first, and push coke
From the bay, where they made the word playa hater
Where they shoot instead of squabbin' like hockey playas (2x)

I still got a mirror in my pocket
The kind of career I’m havin' at this age defies logic
I’m tryna get my one’s up, stack my issue?
Finger on my stapler, or should I say pistol
From the bay, where they made the word playa hater
Where they shoot instead of squabbin like hockey playas
Fat ass wad full a' hundreds, I ain’t got no cents
40 Water, bring me up to speed, pimp
Nice guys finish last and stay broke
Bad guys finish first, and push coke
Ain’t nothing new under the sun
The gift of gab God blessed me with his tongue
In cahoots with the streets and the vocal booth
Solified, documented, partna' I got proof
Mouthpiece, shoulda been a pimp
I’m more than just a rapper, my nigga, I’m an event


California ain’t always sunny
California nose kinda runny
Might go to church on Sunday
And sell dope on Monday
One hand on the scale, the other one on the bible
Askin' the Lord to protect me from my enemies and my rivals
Posted with my Bushmaster chopper assault rifle
For those that ain't ain't welcomed Lookin out the window like Malcolm
That’s dramatics music straight from the gravel that underground
If I give you the script, you best not read it upside down
Man I drink too much, I got two dranks
Man I think too much, I got two brains
E-40, Fonzarelli, man I got two names
I got two chains so I tote two thangs
Sick-wid-it click thick like Wu-Tang
I’m the heart of the Bay, the artery and the veins
The club was crickets till E-40 walked in, I get it poppin'
Man, it was so quiet you could hear a mouse pistol cockin'


Man, it’s the block brochure, man, the ave almanac
The hustler’s handbook, the really lived that
Run off wit' my sack and get yo' helmet cracked
Have you gaspin for air, like an asthma attack
I’m from that 80’s era when we didn’t wear no mascara
When we played by the rules, and seldom turned on dudes
Anything can be confused, any beef can be fixed
Long as nobody got knocked down, or tried to fuck your bitch
Some of my fellas so grimy that they ain't never been to a club
Some of my fellas so street that they ain't never been outta they hood
Hold court on the soil, not in front of a judge
Get down when you mad ain’t no need for holdin' a grudge
My  my speakers, my whole system go
40 what kinda amp you got  Memphis mojo
Feezy where you been, playa, it’s been a while
Waitin around for this real shit to come back in style",https://genius.com/E-40-nice-guys-lyrics

I'ma hit 'em with the torch
Getting money is a sport

Uh, it ain't gotta be over no skrilla, man
A dummy'll kill ya
Eat you up with the rototiller
Nobody can hear ya
Welcome to the mind of the fried and burnt
Cali-harm-ya life, souped up and turnt
No ski mask, bare faced and all
Been looking for him for years, finally seen him and saw
A chance he prob'ly never would got if it was night
There at an intersection, two active cameras at the stoplight
Disobedient and hardheaded as you can see and can tell
School and education he failed, but in the streets he prevailed
His grandma used to always yell:
""Slow down sonny or you gonna end up going to hell
And you gonna burn for eternity.""
""Forever?""
""Yeah, eternity.""
""Man G-O-D don't give a mother-fuck about me!""
The mind-frame of a youngster depended on who he up under
Now the choir at his funeral singing ""Going Up Yonder""

'Til somebody shelf me I'm the sickest nigga healthy
There's nothing you can tell me, dice don't fail me
These hoes want to nail me, you niggas don't smell me
Can't stay up out of jail and he back and forth to court
Seen him in downtown Vallejo, be: ""Cousin you got a 'port?""
I said: ""Brodie I don't smoke"", he said: ""It's cool""
Showed me a 40-cal torch,
 ""Lil nigga you a fool.""
Getting money be the sport, 
so we ball like Laveranues
Grown men clips yet and bitches looking thirty-ish
Everybody clean but we do suckers the dirtiest
Nice with the flow, everything I spit is courteous
But still I move mean like road rage
Give a nigga that gas, he need Rolaids
Magazine, homie, you could get a whole page
Stay up in a bad bitch's mouth like Colgate

Make a dope fiend my spokesman
Give him a bump of this (I'll take this shit)
Get him going, he'll be back and then he spendin' chips (Chill!)
Sucker repellent,
 stay far from me (Watch out nigga!)
You from that area that snitch from  (nuttin'-ass nigga)
.357 stainless snub
If they fire it'll wake a nigga's game up
I got two P's of green (I need a buyer)
I need a coke connection ('cause coke keep getting higher)
Back, forth and forth
Cookin' in the kitchen, pitchin'- pitchin' off the porch
Milk like money, smell it through my new denim
My pants sag
 like my pockets got weights in 'em (Damn!)
They got me back on my mailman federal shit
In a major way,  gang for a pinch
I got crack dreams, man I'm gon' blow up!
Ain't no money why the lawyer gon' show up?

Pop Ya Collar,Loyalty and Betrayal,2000.0,"Uh-huh; barbecue or mildew, hhhoe?
Ssshit heh
My fetti has a first name - it's E-A-R-L
About my mail, ssshit!
Nigga you know I'm up in this motherfucker, on a good one!
Fffuck yes!!

You know what I mean? It's like a, a Y-2-Yea thing y'know?
(Haha) We does this out here (fo' schizzie)
We pop our collars; please believe that playboy (like this here)
My moves is swift, I'm stiff with mine
Remi Martin straight, then I hit it with lime
It's time to shine, to strike my pose
Five carats on my pinky, pickin my nose (BEATCH)
I stroll on hoes, and give 'em a chance
To let me see the ass while they backup dance
I glance and breeze - if the body is true
I'm off and on to part two (part TWO)

Now I done scanned at the club (what else?)
I popped my collar to all my folks with love (what else?)
And all the niggas that didn't respond to me (what else?)
I got my dogs watchin constantly (what else, what else?)
With one hand in the baseball glove
Hella throwaways - and dangerous subs
For my protection and my protection only
This boss balla slippin whatchu thought I was phony?

Fresh up out my Coupe de Ville, I popped my collar twice
About my money this loot is real, plus I'm dipped in ice
I got a fat mansion on the hill, cause I made a mill'
So if you see me please believe, cause I'm yo' potnah still

(Pop ya collar!) It's all from the wrist
(Pop ya collar!) Been poppin my collar since Moby was a goldfish..
.. leavin 'em curious
Hoppin out of my Lincoln Continental, signature serious..
.. parkin lot pimpin!
One of my niggas yell (HOLD ME DOWN) while I was pissin
Is that young 40 y'all?
Drunk as fuck and about to fall?

Done washed my shoes, the gators they bite
Baby bright light but not my type
But if she want tonight, she come with dollars
She either holler, or pop a nigga collar
I'm fresh up out that Coupe de Ville
Four times gold on my vogue wheels
Big sunroof with the insides ill
Gotta give it to the boy he got skills

 Made a mill'.. uh-huh, HOE BEATCH!

(Pop ya collar!) I done stepped on in
(Pop ya collar!) Now can I come up?
All these freaks hang out at the dump
Me and my dogs got this party on pump
All the hoes look like they wanna hump
I'm bout to pull a lil' lightweight stunt

On a mizznission about that cut
Rough, buck, smokin on a blizznut
Ticked, pucked, ?? ?? was loc'd
Dick, Van Dyke, all up in her truck
Lick, at night, E-Feezy ain't no punk
Gobble, swallow, get her hella drunk
40 ounce bizznottle, til I tr-uh-Trump
Tip, hollow, mizzmillimeter thump
Feels no sinorrow for a sucka sap chump
Ya underdig? Yeah just
Y'know just tug on your lil' shirt
Pull it a lil' bit


That's what we do out this way.. twice!
Dipped in ice..
Where? Made a mill'

And come back every fifteen minutes in a different car

Finger on my thumper (Thumper) in this concrete habitat

We got, ten houses, can't even, spend ours
We go, invent ours, in about, ten hours
Comin' with that mob-ass shit, it's a hit bitch

Better watch out, man, 'cause they sick
Somebody better get this dick

The cherries, sirens, got me layin', po-po penelopes make
Noises, throughout the night, bring the yellow tape
Souls, lost, bodies bagged up
Streets, blocked off, victims AIRlifted up
Lieutenants, bosses, block monsters, kingpins
Funkin', beefin', killin' they best friends
And to prevent bloodshed we used to try to reason
But right now it's a drought, and ain't nobody eatin'
So therefore (Therefore) there the problem right there
Ain't no jobs provided, so I'ma blame the mayor
Sinister mob, throughout the town
Y'all grew up on this shit, y'all love the sound
Y'all threw up on the shit, all on the tar
Got you twisted with the shit, dang near wreck yo' mama's car
Dirty needles, welfare checks
Poverty, despair, housing projects

Smeb with me, and Nate Dogg
M.D. 20/20 seeded and breeded turf hog
Take a 40 to the head with me, 8 ball
Let your anger out, throw it up against the wall {*glass breaks*}
I dropped a C-note, didn't miss it
A little skank from the other side picked it up and kisses it like
{*smooch*} ""Good luck, you deserve it and you makin' it
Even though, my boyfriend and them be hatin' it""
I'm a top hat, them cats is mouses
I sport ice, cost more than niggas' houses
I'm nothing close to bein' fake
I tried to tell them tricks a long time ago to get in this rap game
But it's too late
I'm on my way to my (Where?) studio session
Switchin' ears, tryin' to get a better reception
Changin' gears, super-side
Poppin' wheelies in my, brand new ride

If you gon' ride nigga go'n ride (Zzzzoom)
If you gon' hide nigga go'n hide (Witcho' bitch-ass)
If you gon' shoot nigga go'n shoot (Doo doo doo doo doo doo)

Glow in the dark night vision, solar ray tinted glass
Power heated side view mirrors,  back airbags
Off the new with the stump (Skee-skrrt)
My Cadillac DTS DeVille 32 valve ain't no punk
Get up outta here
Some ol' Jack London Square hollerin' at you just ate the gravel
I said I ain't no mark-ass any ol' rapper, potna, I was built for battle
And about all that ol' jaw-jackin' you doin', potna, I ain't playin'
You get your head put on flat, think it's a game
I got choppers done fucked with jelly jaws
Screwed a few, bitches in my cars
A temper problem, I can't hide
Issues, violence, problems deep inside

Although them niggas is tight, as tight as me they never will be
So what some niggas is famous, man, some niggas is out for they G's

Why They Don’t Fuck With Us,Grit & Grind,2002.0,"Y'all ready for this
ARE YOU READY!!!!!!
Ho, uh, uh

Why they don't fuck with us
Don't fuck with us, don't fuck with us
Don't fuck with us
Why they don't fuck with us
Don't fuck with us, don't fuck with us
Don't fuck with us

I use colorful rhymes, you probably heard
From somebody else's lit, but really it's my spit
I came from the streets, I'm not from the 'burbs
Although I stay in the burbs, I come from the streets
Money hungry hustlers trying to make ends meet
Stingy young brothers when we walk we squeak
Have street, have money, have heart
I ain't trying to but I'm trying to go off the park
I'm on deck, Sick Wid It Records I rep
I'm a vet, but I spit like a youngster from the set
I ain't tripping, I knew it was political
They left us out the top for us, me and Mystikal
I rap fast but you could quote my rhymes
The greatest game spitter of all times
The most underrated rapper in the game
But everybody wanna use my slang

Why they don't fuck with us
Don't fuck with us, don't fuck with us
Don't fuck with us
Why they don't fuck with us
Don't fuck with us, don't fuck with us

I don't know what they was thinking
When they thought what they was thinking
But they shit enough to fuck it
I've been a hustler since birth
So when they haul me off and
Put me up in that hearse remember this verse
I did a song with Fred Durst,
 
as far as the independent
Underground scene, I was the first
To get a big deal, couple mill, and some mo'
See times have changed ever since then back in '94
Playa been eating off that bill, for a while
I always did me I never changed my style
I gave it to you raw and uncut
75 percent of the words, I made it up
You ask me why I speak the real the way I feel
How come E-40 so groupie and y'all so game goofy
Started to the back that I'm a force
They never put me on the cover of The Source

Why they don't fuck with us
Don't fuck with us, don't fuck with us
Don't fuck with us
Why they don't fuck with us
Don't fuck with us, don't fuck with us
Don't fuck with us

Don't fuck with us, don't fuck with us
Don't fuck with us
Why they don't fuck with us
Don't fuck with us, don't fuck with us
Don't fuck with us

Next tape, they can't trace the calls
I change numbers, like a playa changes draws
I'm having money, money long stretch like a bungee
When he use to come around ask the easter bunny
(Tell me do you know E-40)
Bet you the players say that's the homie
You liable to find me on the AVE. on the main drag
Or on the corner sipping yac up out a brown paper bag
I don't need no iron im already creased
Enough game to sell sand to a beach
Enough game to sell a hooker to a priest
Enough game to sell rookie rocket Scottie to a street
I rap fast but you could quote my rhymes
The greatest game spitter of all times
The most underrated rapper in the game
But everybody wanna use my slang

Bass Rocks,Sharp On All 4 Corners: Corner 2 ,2014.0,"(“Bass”) (“Bass rocks” “Bass rocks”)

Bass rocks, nigga; bass rocks, nigga
Get your cake up; cake up, nigga
Still in the loop like a hula hoop
Still connected like a router
Got a line on the powder
Still got a whole lot of power
Still the same muthafucka you met a while ago, a real one
Not a hoe, being thorough is all I know
I’m a pro at getting dough
Or should I say guap
If I had to, I could cook a ki in a wok
Bust my Glock, my 2-2 nickel across a hater face
Break his fuckin’ jaw, knock his teeth out so he can’t taste
Have him eating out a straw, for disrespecting a staple
Get your car riddled, split in half like a bagel
Fuckin’ around in the yola game, gotta be careful
They’ll rob for dinero, pull up in all-black apparel
Hit their target like an arrow
Shoot you in your bone marrow
Tear up out in a Chevy souped up Camaro
BIATCH!

(“Bass”) (“Bass rocks” “Bass rocks”)

See he throws the whole unit in a big ass gumbo pot
Foam, stir, let it settle to make it lot
Take it out of the oowop and let it dry
Doing what I gotta do to get by
Yola I supply, break it down into zips
Halfs, quarters, kibbles n bits
Overkill, extras, it’s all in the wrist
They’ll walk from Cali to Texas long as they get they fix
Pitching no-hitters and shutouts, you get my drift
The players on plug with that
I cop from them when the drought ‘bout to hit
Everybody that I know got a banger, extended clip
Rather be caught with than without, some real shit
He got too much time on his hands
I ain’t got no time to be playin’
He too busy trippin’ off somebody else’s wealth
I’m too busy stacking dollars taller than myself
BIATCH!

(“Bass”) (“Bass rocks” “Bass rocks”)

All money ain’t good money and every time ain’t the right time
I don’t be out here stuntin’, clumsy, looking like a plate of swidnine
I be under on the tuck, sitting soft with the seat reclined
Looking out for the smirchers, the kind that pull on the side
And try to slather a player, arm out the window from the blind
Hit your nigga at a exit, a light or a stop sign
Even I was broke, you wouldn’t know it ‘cause I’m hella laced
I hibernate ‘til I’m up again, won’t show my face
‘Cause they used to me looking a certain way, ‘bout my pay
Since the ‘80s I’ve been having it my way to this day
I’m an inner-city icon from the 7’s
Where they go from the shoulders and tote weapons
Got that fire like a welder, banked up like a ready teller
Correctional institution, revenge and retribution
They’ll steal you out here, mayne, and I ain’t talkin’ ‘bout boostin’
Be ‘bout it, my nigga, or do it movin’

Light it up and throw us the T
Regular or honey berry it don’t matter to me
Cut half banana pack with cherry pie key

Am shit red fizz na crip can’t fist pokin
Mord stone loading hard to keep my eyes open
Feel like lightin another one up just to keep the cycle going

Been gettin my money lately my hussle game’s ferocious
You see my new mercedes it’s domeless
Go hard or go home or go homeless
Money in my shoe box not no bank grinding
Either that or my tubes starting selling that dang tied it


Smokin no cookie no pastry you seeing in HD
You niggas too gazy all my niggas is gravy
Hello wavy baby strunt on 360
Blowing on some gas win a filly wan niche
Down Town in the city blowin next to the rollers
I’m still down blowin ain't no slowing in my modem
Easy on the galaxy run around no batteries
When you like the punch you betta know you betta pass to me
Sliding my porsche hotta than torch
Bout that bullshit I’m running up on a nigga porch
Full force that I unleashed lisa
Goons on your squad for a piece a pizza

I'm from the valley, my nigga, we hella rowdy, my nigga
You have a problem, my nigga, man we gon' solve it, my nigga
Yeah we got it, my nigga, case like the Saudis, my nigga
Let a boss through, so a boss can do what a boss do
I don't Winnie the Pooh, Willie Foo Foo, or Captain Kangaroo
I'm one of the few that say what I'm gonna do and come through
I'm a throwback but at the same time I'm brand new
I can multitask, do two or three things at once
Get my dick sucked, hit the weed, talk on the phone, and get drunk
If you family we family, then say it, mean it
Never let sucker shit come in between us
I'm still mobbing, scheming, and plotting on some millions
Trying to put some paint where it ain't, Sherwin Williams
Right now I'm on this lambi and dank, fuck your feelings
I don't hang with phoneys or fakes, only real ones

D-boy fresh from head to toe
Finna take some down before I go home
Drink my drink and smoke my 'dro
I bet that I pull all these hoes
Now do the playa
Nuvo sippin and two-steppin
Do the playa
West coast reppin with my weapon

This hustler cold, always in monster mode
The game can be sold and told at the same time
Never goin against the grain
I'm on the front line and the main line
Of this West Coast scene I grind
And I never drop a dime for reduced time
I'm a staple in this shit, a pillar in this shit
Don't believe me? Nigga, ask your bitch
Just now getting warmed up, just now getting started
Triple O.G., still getting carded
Bump any batch, ho, I'm a mack
Ain't no age on game, bitch, whack don't crack
People always ask me why I'm seldom seen
Is he still green, do he still fuck with the fiends?
Nope, I'm clean, in the rap game there's more green
I'm eating just like a king, got my hands in everything
From gritting and pitching raw, hubba rocks in my jaw
Platinums on the wall, ball 'til we fall


Damn, look at that mayne, she ain't playing, she handling
Let me put my macking in motion and put the peas in the pie
She cakey, she yokin, she got a big ass butt
I'm a Bay area nigga, my nigga, I be wigglin'
I could go to any hood in the world and fit right in
Hit it for five, hold it for ten
Smoking and sipping yac
Internationally known, accepted, and highly respected
There's a shortage on real ones we better start getting in sync
Before the suckers take over and we become extinct
Shout out to all the bosses before me I'd like to thank
Street legends with love and respect like Hamp ""Bubba"" Banks
All my fixtures and factors, factors and fixtures
Car passin travelers, Louis the XIII sippers
O.G's need youngsters and youngsters need O.G's

Return phone calls and you will keep your friends
Free all of my folks behind them walls in the pen
I took all of my ones and went and bought me a Benz

I could pull a botch if my breath stank
In a beat up dented bucket on an empty tank

Out here it's hustle and murders be careful if you a tourist
Hyperspace and sedated love to get wasted and faded
Levitated, elated, delated eyes dilated
Loaded like a Mossberg jar full of herb
If you want beef then I'll bring a herd
You can't spell West without the E (Who you put that on?)

I'm crispy like Panko, monitor on my ankle
Real nigga like Django, I put my foot in yo anal

Real niggas over here won't shit switch
In the scraper tryna find me a quick lick
Skate through the set I fuck around and do a kick flip
Turn up a nigga do the damn thang
I might buy U-Haul tryna move the damn things
I can't play with you can't lay with you
That's on my mama I'm gone
Talking about fuck haters we touch paper nigga go hard or go home
Early morning I be on it like I want it nigga
Choppa loaded aim it right at my opponent nigga
Red dot a head shot'll be a bonus nigga
Inglewood to the bay, this west side Killafornia nigga
Soo woo!



Whaaaat?
What the bloodclot be
This here pipe what you might wan see
This here flight joint filled with OG
And your girlfriend puss can't go a day without me (whaaaaaaaaat!)
Problem, money Daytona check the aroma
Good on the corner hunter persona put pussies in comas
You thick as  good as granola
Hold up the phone I told you I'm on you like million dollar 
Hot boy come take notes
Your girl wanna fuck and I'm a let her like notes
Envelope  hit her from the back
Smoked me a joint then dipped off
You're fucking with a mack!",https://genius.com/E-40-turn-up-or-burn-up-lyrics
Black Is Beautiful,The Curb Commentator Channel 2,2020.0,"They put their club upside your head
And then turn around and accuse you of attacking them
Every case of police brutality against a Negro follows the same pattern
They attack you, bust you all upside your mouth
And then take you to court and charge you with assault
What kind of democracy is that?

Uh, although it's uncertain times I still smile
Social injustice and racial profile
Forty acres and a mule
Black history should be a mandatory class in school
Strong-minded, solid like granite
We the most forgiving human beings on the planet
They the raped the men in our family in front of wives
Tried to make us look weak in front of our kids, dehumanize
And our leadership hella devil-sent
Got in the White House by trolling our only Black president
Evil, evil, evil
Brainwashed our people, say, ""What Obama do for Black people?""
Me personally, I wanna fade
Fell out with so-called friends 'cause they drunk the Kool-Aid
They whipped us and hung us up on a tree
Lit us on the fire so the community could see

It's crazy how my beautiful skin
Could get me strapped up, strung up, swung in the wind
Tasered, maced, and cuffed, arm under my chin
Kneeled on, wheeled on, call for mama again
Dragged from the back of a pick-up for people to see
K-9 that bite down, now there's flesh in their teeth
Douse me in gas, burn the ash and left in the streets
And even then, some white folk'll take a picture with me
My beautiful skin could also get me thrown on a boat
Live by the flow, my name, chain, culture revolt
Pray to the heavens 'cause hell on earth is all that I know
My skin made it where I got nowhere to go
When my people were trying to escape, they either killed or they capture us
And now they got the nerve to tell me ""Go back to Africa""
African-American, my ancestors died for it
So fuck them racist motherfuckers, I'ma ride for it

Back Against the Wall,The Element of Surprise,1998.0,"Tryin to make it..
It's been a long road
Sic-Wid-It Records

UNNNNNNNNNGGGGGHHHHH! (C'mon, ooh)
Y'all feel that? (I feel it playboy, I smell you)
It's real out here 40 (It's real Pee!)

I'm out here in the slums where thugs be usin, ghetto tactics
Like, choppin up candy cane
Sittin on top of a dried up JCPenney pee stained mattress
Whatever it takes to survive, see that's what I supply
Like slippin and slidin in the grocery store
And settling out of court
Soft white coke a black turn into hard solidses
Thirty-eight snub nosed pistol grip lay ninjas on they wallets
The saga continues, the struggle's just beginnin
And it's hard to look up to snotty folks, cause THEY be sinnin
'Pac gone, Biggie gone, Seagram gone -- and we also lost Eazy-E
One of the first gangster rappers of all time
To the most vicious and deadliest disease in history since cancer
To Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, tombstone
From the graveyard shift, RBL's Mister C
One love, to Rappin Ron and Plann B
Victims of the trigger (unnngggggggghhhhhh)
Po' out a little liquor

It's not the same, this world is crazy
We out here goin through it all
Everything must change, it's gettin shady
Got our backs against the wall

UNGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHH, I shed tears for pain 40, some for anger
Seen bloodshed by crooked cops, and gangbangers
Feel my pain (unnnggghhh) only time'll change it
And fast money, cars, and bitches got me trapped in this game
And my lil' homies ballin, picture me fallin
And momma in the funeral screamin and crawlin
Is there a heaven or hell?
To ghetto kids in the anky only time will tell
And jealousy, and envy, come with money
While crooked, politicians, run the country
And it's a, damn shame to see my, weeples vanish
Now they teach us ebonics, what about english and spanish
I couldn't, live my life behind bars and gates
While the government play a game called process to eliminate


Case #246, shootin in an inhabited dwellin
They was steady complainin about the dope sellin
But they ain't never been evicted, or convicted
They ain't never been subpeonaed to court, or arrested
Shackled like an animal for pushin rocks
Dang near choked to death by motorcycle cops
Pepper sprayed and laughed at like that shit was funny
Pregnant breezy threw down on her tummy
Do you ever think I'll ever be able to get
A chance to repent and ask the lord for forgiveness
Before he close the casket, will my son end up growin up
Without a father will he end up bein a bastard?
A bastard -- that's a good question (unggggggggghhhh!)

Spooky,Revenue Retrievin’: Graveyard Shift,2011.0,"Hard drugs you knuckle head and thugs, fake identification, getting kicked out of clubs
If it wasn't for my PEN I'd be in a PEN...
In the Bay where I stay, is eerie and grim
Smurkish, merkey, spooky and eerie, never know which one of my partners gonna try to rob me and kill me
Thats why I keep my ear to the gravel
My cleats to the turf
California built me for battle
Since the day I was birthed
First day on the earth, my first breathe of life
Coffins and hearst. everyday somebody done died
Dispute and disperse they cut him down with a nine millimeter heater shot him in his torso and spine

See that ball cap low, dark face so we lurk on these niggas
Graveyard shift clocking in faithful
Pay me consistant
Smurkish, murky eerie grim
It's spooky
Out here on the grind
So spooky
I'm just trying to get mine

This spook just stood by the door
They shut the trap house down, with nails and boards
My auntie neck still sore
The PO Po beat her ass and threw her on the floor
Plus I got more than half a key
Gotta pay my lawyer fee
Out there on the streets they owe me
Side to side like a wheel alignment, its right and its left
School is in session my nigga pull up yo desk
I got that old money mixed in with a little bit of this new money
Fuck with niggas that's real
I dont fuck with the false or phoney
Me and my holmies and chronies
My relatives and my partners
Trying to raise up our sons and our daughters to grow up and become some scholars

Mine mine mine
Get mine get mine

They pulled up with the slap
While I was washing and drying my clothes at the neighborhood laundrymatt
Loose as a goose my pants; I almost crapped
Out of bounds lastnight I let my cousin borrow my strap
My life's surrounded by crack, but I wanta give back
Move on top of the hill, even though i'm straight from the flats
Go out and buy me a grill, for my teeth and my lac
Man I got get back skills, if my fetti collapse
Personality and attitude of a ghetto child
Fuck a deal man i'm taking this shit to trial
My attorney done did all that he can do
So I'm a stay silent all the way through
See that ball cap low, dark face so we lurk on these niggas
Graveyard shift clocking in faithful
Pay me consistant

Out here on the grind
So spooky

Military time, military time (military)

Military time, military time (military)

I'm out here on the gravel, grindin' in the fog
Track record, won't allow me, to get a job
Rollin' up a 'wood, lookin' like a log
Unlike the rest of the world, I still believe in God
My granny tellin' be to pray, continue being faithful
Don't side with the devil, he hella hateful
Pay attention to your warning signs
Be prepared to repent, before he close the blinds
Pack an extra clip, let 'em know your with the shit
The niggas that kill you, be the niggas you grew up with
I don't trust shit, I don't even trust my dick
Most of the time I get funkin', it's over a bitch
Protect your punk and your medulla oblongata
Never know when they're comin' to bust your head like a piñata
Can't be soft as doctor cotton, or Charmin toilet tissue
Stay on your P's and your Q's with the military issue

I'm floodin' the streets, Baton Rouge, New Orleans
They put me in the catapult I'm soarin' to my dreams
You ain't on the same page, so get a book marker
A champ with the Glock, kicks like it's Foot Locker
If you ain't in it for no funds nigga look farther
These niggas out here buyin' guns, they tryin' to look harder
I'm young but a bitch smarter than the older age
You gotta learn to break the cycle if you wanna change
See I'm one of those guys that put you on your game
These bitches want a fly nigga like they Lois Lane
I'm so ashamed with these hoes with their lame asses
Ain't even got their head straight, they play the game backwards
I do it silk smooth in some grape fabric
Then I get ghost like I'm James nigga, Saint Patrick

It's military time 40 trees ???
My grind on erosion, ain't nothin' can stop me
I might fall but I'm right back up like Rocky
I'm huntin' for that money, like I need a ???
I'm just trying to keep it hostage, 'cause I'm needin' bread
Hey I hate being broke much as I hate the feds
Free my family members locked down ???
Roll up a chop then we blow it down
I be loaded like a Glock when it's full of rounds
Double F in this bitch and we known to clown
Puffin' on that loud pack, it be full of sound
All work no time boss
I'm with those hundred stacks tax free like a crime boss
Little baby came through ???
Big dog, you just a pup like ???

Got Rich Twice,The Ball Street Journal,2008.0,"Hustler 'til I die, drink the bar dry
Baby, there go that man again right back in the public eye
Drunk like Mel Gibson, get high, got a ton of DUI’s
Landy cognac, sippin' X.O., me and my guys
Doing it colossal, living our lives
Trying to get this bobblehead bopper girl to follow me in my ride
So I can make like a dentist and convince her to open wide
Kick her out when I finish, take my ballin' ass back inside
Drunk terminology, corner talk, that's all I know
California mentality, ask about me, pimp, I go
You can check my track record, I don't like to feud
But if I must, I'll have your head severed
Soil block living, trap zones and projects
Corner boy grit, and crack, apartment complex
Worldwide, outside of the Bay they give me my 'spect
The business with hitters, victors, and corporate execs

He ain't goin' nowhere, the boy too nice (Too nice)

I cut him off like an umbilical cord, turned off his lights

I make it look easy but it's not, I'm just doing Feezy
Why should I stop now, pimp? The game need me
Be a real one, pimp, come get it and do it, he used to it
Trying to get these millions profit, and move it, push it and prove it
Louis luggage, ruggish and rugged, my intellect
Duckin' suckas hollerin' and screamin' my hood set
The shiny socks on my Chevy box shaking the cops
You mean I'm off, I'm in it too heavy, I can't stop
People scam and plot on my tombstone and grave plot
Hope I die and rot, have my funeral on my block
The streets, they don't play fair (Play fair)
The mayor, he really don't care (Don't care)
I'ma work the three jobs, tryna keep a roof on our heads
Bologna sandwich, used to peel the mold off the bread

He ain't goin' nowhere, the boy too nice (Too nice)

We on soil, you could see that it's real (See that it's real)
But everywhere we go, we burn hundred bills (Burn hundred bills)

Automatics and semis, high performance and Hemis
In the thick of the soil where we think Buicks is Bentleys
Coffee pots boil, burn, flank, simmer and stew
I'm off of the soil, y'all, I hope you is, too
Out of the Belvedere, cap unit a crew
Showing their underwear, sagging, that's what we do
Turfin', trappin' and stackin' and money mackin'
Servin', earthquake slappin' and trunk rattlin'

You got the snapback and I ain't talking 'bout the cap
Pretty young thang, like hella pre

I told her put something sexy on
No bra, little dress, and thong
I'm coming through with that extra long
IPod with the best songs
When I'm horny I don't play bitch
Hit the store and got a bottle of your favourite shit
I know how to please a woman
Give her what she wants when I'm cuming
I like loading aim
Then I'm up out on the road of game
All these females know my name
Heard I was slanging that golden thang
Too many traps too check
Bitches always wanna have nasty sex
But it's too much cash to get
I never leave empty-handed, ask the bitch

King guapa, panty dropper
Give a bitch that boom; Chief Rocka
Shock locker, neck boppers, Phantom driver
All white ghost, no opera
Street mobber, rich one to kick like shocka
Riding with a thing on my thing; let it chop her
Fuck coppers, 'bang bang' at yo partna
We body, you body boys no problem
Sick Wid It, no liers
Admit it, Forty Water, we on fire
Wet pussy, now I'm diving
Full of that drink, now I'm driving
I'm a beast bitch, on ya knees bitch
Off the Hennessey, now we looking for a freak bitch
Like Lil B said, 'I can fuck yo bitch'
So I'm a fuck yo bitch",https://genius.com/E-40-slide-through-feat-tyga-lyrics
Trained To Go,Revenue Retrievin’: Night Shift,2010.0,"He trained to go mane
Trained to go?
Nomtombout?
When they're orders (ah-uh) nigga he trained to go nigga
Like, like I'm saying (I know) he a fool right?
I was born in it man it's either killed or be killed
It's sick out here brah

Foreal, he trained to go!
Look, ain't no telling what he do for it, move for it shoes been laced for it
He trained to go!
Man the boy's built with it green light that hit he deal with it
He trained to go!
Man the kid live by it, no way out then he dying
He trained to go!
Look, buss a head and no skill bag taking damn near where you live at, yeah

He trained to go
Never judge a book by it's cover you never know
That sucka a stab ya in the juggler in ya kidneys or ya bladder
Some of these niggas you think is real is really fuckin' actors
Never been a sucka or a weenie
Brall a muthafucka toast him like a pair neenie
With the semi-automatic shimmy
Get on the case fast like a hemi
For a favor or some cash to feud the enemy
Get out of my fuckin way
At the end of the day it's all about who goin throw they life away
Or whoever goin try to stay on this earth a few more years
Revenge is what they say in and out of ears

Look, then thirty was quiet but he the mastermind
Load to fire coyotes, supper time
He the reason the club was stop playing rap
Or make urban radio change they format
Give a nigga this trained to go the slightest reason
Marinate it, soil savvy, highly seasoned
Cham, buss a head and no skill
Back glass in the metal find this called train wreck


I told my right hand he need to get with the left
Fuck that a couple zips now I'm a call that shift
Fiends let my doe they be begging like Keith Sweat
When I slide through the hood what they ain't seen yet
The lil homies geeked up serve compell habits
He don't buy clothes he buy clips for them ratchet
My dirties day goon stay shoes with the shit
Down a nigga dawg and do his time like Vick
I be at the trap watching for the police
I ain't KFC but I can serve you the 4-piece
Or we can do the action I'm ready for the battle
I care run or nothing and I hit'chu with the handle
Show up with the goonies, automatic lifters
Sprang the whole clip make it rain like a strip club
They was just talking, thug imposters
Or doing just sumthing real show up at the concerts


Nigga I'm trained
Uh, nigga I'm wet in the paint
Nigga, I'm trained to go
Knock a hoe to the flo make her get that doe
Sock a nigga out for running his mouth
See what it's about pump fear no doubt
I'm the boss of this muthafuckin' house
The way I do my thang with a lil gangbang
Slang that kane spaghetti a nigga brain
You niggas is a muthafuckin' lame
See the streets blocked up nigga I'm the mane",https://genius.com/E-40-trained-to-go-lyrics

 I'm 'posed to break his ass right, right?
 Den give up the ass!
 Okay, let's go hit the pot
Watch 'em serve a knot and get two hundred off that cot
 That's trill; crack him for his change
Get off in his narrow mind, exercise yo' game

Screw you real good and steal the money underneath the mattress

We fake orgasms, and make 'em think we cuming
 Okay; dem some cool clues
I ain't gon' lie, you laced my tennis shoes
I'mma go back and tell all my dudes
Y'alls playin football with basketball rules
 Jewels - our niggas, we make 'em
Buy engagement rings and give ultimatums
 But see Suga you ain't dealin with no square ass figure
They call me Earl; I can show 'em the newest way
To play the oldest game in the world
I ain't never been one to be suckin up to no chick
My grandaddy told me to whip the pussy
Don't let the pussy be the whip

Hit yo' windows out with a bat and put yo' tires on the flat
Now we can be some skanless sneaky sly hoes
Burnin indo even though to' up from the flo'

But my broad keep tryin to send me back to jail
 She caught you fuckin?

Took her keys and scratched up my Cutlass
You gotta watch us slick talkin bay area niggas off that gin
We'll fuck around and get drunk and run up in yo' best friend

Art of Story Tellin Pt. II,The Block Brochure: Welcome to the Soil 6,2013,"We was club hoppin last night the homie got in a fight
He was drunk i hate wakin up to fuck
All kinda a text messages and voicemails on my jack
The nigga real into sayin they goin push my shit back
When they see me it’s on onsite no talk
This dog got a bite that will back up his bark
It’s started all over a broad no chedda
She was a site for sore eyes cool little put together
I kept tellin the homies that she was bad news
Knew a few dudes that been in her fallopian tubes
But he didn’t listen thought i was trippin
Know he bout to be dead or either in the prison
Most of the times it’s over some kitten man i ain't kiddin
If you slippin and trippin then good riddance
They think got ammunition but we got more
Assault weapons tear the head off a dinosaur
Bitch

I hate wakin up to funk, funk, funk, funk, funk 
But i can’t let them think that i’m a punk
I hate wakin up to funk, funk, funk, funk, funk 
I’m still story tellin 
The art of story tellin 
I’m still story  tellin 
Bitch this is story tellin 
Bitch

Rally up or should i say molly up
Had a little bit of lemon, a little bit of sprite in my styrofoam cup
To fuck em, get on em, fallet em, debone em
Scout them bitches for even thinkin about going to war with a boss
One a them punks forgot to turn they location off
So we found out where they sleepin rest they noggin
Parked right down the street in the bucket
Waited till they tweeted, post a picture man
Erry other minute they on instagram
Showcasing they showin they faces, braggin
Perpetrating  outta bounds laggin
Gotta be careful what you say they’ll research where you stay
Ain't no resets in the bay them nigga ain't for play
The element of surprise will bust a dusk or dime
Slaughter a motherfucker in his front lines


Ugh ah
Meanwhile back at the crimescene
The hellacopters and homicide and forensics team
Takin reports and talkin to the neighbours
Porch to porch but the neighbours don’t wanna be on paper
So they keep they mouths zip, what they say
We was in the house watchin netfilx we didn’t see shit
Was it random or a hit that’s what the detectives say to victim family cryin throwin a fit
The new game if i tell his mama who did that ain't snitching
Yea it is my nigga get out in the street and handle business
Can’t be no powder puff just because he light skinned don’t think he ain't tuff
He’s gonna bust, imagine it, 9 times out off 10 his aim is accurate
They think they got ammunition but we got more
What you got assault weapons tear the head off a dinosaurs


Hello
Hey 40
Hey what’s up frost
Yeah man, get on up man
What’s goin on
They just got on rallo last night man
They got on rallo

Nuttin’ Ass Nigga,Federal,1993.0,"(I'm not a nuttin' ass nigga, just down for my riches)
I'm not a nuttin' ass nigga

I'm not a nuttin' ass nigga, just down for my riches
I figure it takes about a million or 500.000 tapes
To become officially gold or platinum status
That's why I'm always at this
Practice, in and out the studio 24-7
My occupation, this is how I make my livin'
I get harassed mostly everywhere I go
Can't do my thing without a motherfuckin' po-po
All up in my mix 'cause I'm tryina maintain
And get a grip on some lightweight fame
Born and raised in the valley South Vallejo
The northern part of Cali, 'bout my mail
Struggle and strive all my life in a world of grief
Sucker motherfuckers wanna knock me off my feet
But I'mma keep on steppin' and gettin' bigger
I'm not a nuttin' ass nigga


Not too long ago, I'm off to the bank to cash my check
The lady teller wouldn't give me no damn respect
She started acting hella snotty, kinda prejudiced
I guess she didn't like the way that a nigga was dressed
Before I could even get my foot in the door, right
The bitch already had a brother like me stereotyped
Ready to push the button with no delay'a
I said wait a minute, baby, you mistakin' me for Andre'a
I'm not a fail tail rat head wannabe
I wouldn't rob a fuckin' bank for publicity
I get it honestly, legally, so have no fear
I make more in a week than you do in a year
Straight out the ghetto, Hillside resident
Sick Wid It Records and tapes, and I'm the president
So don't go thinkin' that every brother's out to get ya
I'm not a nuttin' ass nigga


Sometimes my language is vulgar, lotsa profanity
I try not to trip when kids' parents be sweating me
18 and over, that's what you gotta be
To purchase my tape and make sure you got I.D
That's all I can say, so mommy and daddy need to peep
It ain't my fault the kids dub it off the streets
They hear it at school, walkin' home and everywhere they go
And most of the violence come from movies on HBO
The shit that I be spittin' is real cause I'm real, see
I'm out to make a mil, do you feel me?
Holdin' my own 'cause I'm grown and intelligent
Tryna knock my hustle? That shit is irrelevant",https://genius.com/E-40-nuttin-ass-nigga-lyrics

Bout, bout bout, bout bout, bout bout bout(2x)

Me and my guys be lurking the streets plottin upside down smiling
Bummin no matter Skully, hoods, bandannas, bullets
Stocking caps Ski masks, loced out murder one classes
Those new Wallabe's, hocked up, Chuck Taylors
Permanent creased five-oh-one jeans
Throw away his real ooze machines, Chinese AK zooms, razorblades
Jerry Curls, fingerwaves, and French braids
Labeled him sinner look out for that motherfucker he might rob ya
Niggas come tatted up head in a body slang

Well it's your nigga Big Bonna niggas be creepin up on ya
Goin for the jugular, niggas trying to slug ya
Catch a nigga doing all kinds of nasty things
Ohh what I feel is mayhem brings
You see us on the block we doing are thuggin, the gottie
Got the whole town wonderin who the fuck shot him
Lookin for the body, tell me what they found
His head in Richmond the rest in the V-town

Thinking about the set up, trying to get my red up
Bout my cock this tech nine and get you wet up blue
So what the fuck they want to do
Seem like we got the vas of these niggas
Caught cash and thought we was through
So fuck this old bat shit, I'll get the gat bitch
And probably blow your brains out
Looking to get my cap fit
Thinking they all acted up and while I'm at yo ass
I'll probably put these fuckin slugs in yo ass

Causing havoc, sparkin up chaos, bringing the ruckus
Heavy metal heaters, mobbin under buckets
(If you can't beat us, then join us)
Get on the team
Street sweepers, grenades, rifles, and M-1-sixteens

It's a cold piece of work out this way
Cause the way niggas are in the baby plan ain't too safe
Niggas will run up in yo car and try to take your face
Move up out the plan so I trust no one take nothing for granted
{?} expanded double 0 chill hillside hillbilly like Jed Clampett
Dammit, us niggas is deep and new improved like techs
Found out where he slept and laid his wave cap
Tycoon decisions, it's really too bad
That those biatches found our bills
Sit up at the roundtable and discuss
Jurisdictional boundaries and territory issues

By any means necessary, so in your chest I bury two buck shots
So who got six niggas next to carry
Off these wanna be's, niggas they gonna see
And if you motherfuckers want some, then 'tach on to me

You see these niggas can't flip doing things that sick (like what)
Cut off your damn dick, make you eat your own shit
But I love a little mayhem fuck it, we can do it
Don't let me get off that masso candy and some fluid


Uh uh - A element of surprise, gettin my gig on
Split yo house in half, with a dreadlock wig on
When you do ya hot ones, shoot low
Cause it's a reflection programmed in the rolls
Til automatics hit the floor
Dump, bust, blast, barefaces
Strike, dip, mash - like a mental patiet
Run, quick, fast, and in a hurry (biaatch)
Don't worry forty vision ain't blurry

It's like military issues, make you wish you never got in
Cause now I'm stalkin niggas like a bitch do
Can only ride so long with that fake shit I take shit
To the limit with no gimmick in ninety-eight bitch
So fuck what you say, and fuck what you play
I down it straight and can't wait to hear what you bitch niggas gotta say
If I can't keep it real you can kill me so feel me cause
I bring things to the game for my scuzzie

We'll kick a niggas door in, hit and lick you brags
Now you ridding in a fan, pulled tight and gag
Then they pullin up out the Glad Bags, the hefty type
(But you niggas ain't got no kind of idea what a chopped up body looks like)
Then them niggas start to pull down your Levis
And bust you in the head with ruger P 85's
Call a mortician, call mark class
Somebody in this motherfucker bout to come up missin, best believe

Whatchu gon' do? (Aight, I'mma tell you like this)

It's like dis
Just point out the target and I'll bet some cash I can't miss
This nigga done started cause I got some ass from his bitch
More broken than hearted, fool on the HILL over this
But I'm just as retarded, I act a FOOL UP IN THIS BITCH
The reason why she departed, cause she was tired of gettin dissed
Dotted and darted all in her eyes like this
But that ain't my business, I keep my game universal
And leave that ol' (??) around shit up to them squares like Urkel
It's too many lobsters up in the ocean, big pimps
But not enough mobsters breakin them in, big pimps
Tellin 40 done taught us how to beginnnnnn
Pull a bitch off the streets and reel her innnnnnn
To my sable, but e'rybody ain't able
Now she's a call girl, dancin on the table

Keep pimpin, keep pimpin (the bigger the pimp, the longer the bread)

Told herself

""From this day here ain't NAR a nigga pumpin fear
Took all I can, but I can't take no mo', enough
Yesternight I got my ass slapped up kinda tough
Got me lookin like a rainbow (a rainbow)
Black eyes, aches and pains, bruises purple and yellow
But I forgive and forget cause it's all gravy (that's right)
I used to fuck for free but now I'm gettin money lately""

Big-ass dookie mayne, big-ass breasts
But the bitch got more miles on her, than Southwest
You can HAVE that ho mayne, but nigga please
Is that any kind of broad you want to make yo' main squeeze?

All kind of cracks and crevice

I take seven switch-a-bitches put 'em in a line
Put 'em on the ho stroll and make 'em work for mine

From Petersberg, to Nova Scot-ia
I got niggas in 'Sace suits, trickin big
Timers in 'gator boots, givin in
Justice, corporate executives
Athletes, cause they respect a bitch
Man you'd be surprised how many niggas love to pay for pussy
Niggas cheat on they wives and jack up all they fuckin money man
I be givin my hoes, bonuses and benefits
Boat cruises and Kamal outfits
Latex to keep their health a good
Checkups at Planned Parenthood (that's it)

Tanji II,Federal,1993.0,"Tanji (Tanji), I snatched her up at a house party (House party)
Her appearance was quite lovely
I wanted to get plugged with old baby
So I told my older cousin to introduce me
She did that indeed
She said, ""Tanji (Tanji), Tanji, this is E""
""E? You mean E-40 from The V?""
I said ""Yeah,"" she said, ""Glad to meet you, E""
I said, ""Obliged, glad to meet you, too""
She said, ""Right"" (Right)
""So tell what’s up with you?""
I said, ""Nathan"" (Nathan)
""How 'bout some steak and wine and an autograph?""
I scratched the top of my head and then I started to laugh
Let’s scoot to my spot
(In what?) My Cutlass Supreme drop
(Where’s that?) Outside in the parking lot
Let’s scat, we’ll be there with a jiffy
Now sit back, dagnabit, I ain't taking no crap
She said, ""Man, baby, is it like that?
I love for a man to take control, over 250 gallon and bold""
She kissed me and then continued down the road
Stay tuned for the next episode

Tan, Tanji episode 2
Take an educated guess
Precisely, Tanji gets undressed
Bingo, gigantic size breasts
With those jingle B-E-L-L-S
I said, ""Groovy, this here’s totally happening""
As my duck, stood straight up and started quacking
Pull over, the next stop is a rest area
Smiling, as I peeped the posterior
Hmm, it was quite impressive
She said, ""E-40, time to get aggressive""
Splendid, as I grin-ded
Plugged it, as I slipped in
Yeah, yeah, I’m just a hustler
And with a black jack jimmy I'll thrust ya
Radical, on a late night pursuit
Wonderful, this could happen to you
She rode me like a cowgirl from Texas
We’ll return right after these here messages

A month later, I’m rollin'
In my 1992 Sterling
Lookin' federal and stupid stuck, what the fuck?
Who is this pulling up on the side of me?
Oh, it looks like Tanji
With a car full a girls that can’t stand me
I said, ""Tanji, I said Tanji, Tanji, Tanji, is that you?""
She said, ""What you think?""
I said, ""I like your new hair-do""
She said, ""Oh, I see you still living comfortable""
I said, ""So? These kinda things can come and go""
She said, ""Hey bro, we need to conversate""
I said, ""Cool, meet me at my house at 8""
8 o’clock comes, and not a minute too late
Here comes Tanji, Tanji, and I’m feeling great
""Tanji, you got some Now or Laters?""
She said, ""Why, you been drinking Brandy separators?""
I said, ""True, but for the last time
Just to relieve, that there stress of mine""
She said, ""Mmm, but anyway
I got some good news and some bad news""
She said, ""The bad news: too much sexing
The good news: I’m expecting""
I said ""Good, good, who’s the lucky dad?""
She said, ""You, 40, honey, aren’t you glad?""
I said, ""Impossible, it couldn’t be
'Cause I’m righteously married with a girl from the V""

Running my alley, my zone, my habitat
I was on my way to the cannabis club and got a sack
And was stopping by the bottle shop on Springs Road and brought some 'Gnac
And a little bit after that I got keyed (you got keyed?)
Went to  City and brought some gear from 
I noticed a couple of youngsters kept on staring at me
But all they really wanted was a picture of me
You a soil celebrity, gotta stay on your Bunyans
You never know who wanna slice yo fucking onion
I hopped up in my truck, bumped into this broad
That I always wanted to fuck, thicker than my brawl
Met her on Facebook, ass, titties and all

Get down or lay down, sit down or stay down
We G5, y'all niggas is Greyhound
My niggas get paid now; I call them niggas my PayPals

Everyday action flashing, like Messy Marv what's happenin'
Stacking and rapping, getting my money right, mashing
Think about buying me a Harley bike, smashing
I hit the club and fucked a couple dykes, tramping

Loving the way I wear, loving the way I say
Uhh, bitches be loving the way I fuck
Loving the way I cuss, loving the way I bust

My Whip Hot,The Block Brochure: Welcome to the Soil 3,2012.0,"Dumpin' in the clutch, drugs in the trunk
No license and I ain’t had task for months
My whip hot (My whip hot)
My whip hot (My whip hot)
Whip's still rolling, so it’s all good
If you blink you might miss me riding through yo' hood
My whip hot (My whip hot)
My whip hot (My whip hot)

Give me some gloves and a screwdriver, hot wire, watch him go to work
In his do-dirt buggy he stole, dope wagon, a key, a skirt (Skirt)
Keep a hooptie underbucket in case he might have to murk
Somebody hurt, somebody, mayne, pop him, wet up their shirt
Leave a sucka stinkin', not smelling good like a Cert
Not for joyriding but for supplying and pushing purp
Take the scenic route, take the back road, it’s high alert
Super thug dressed like a square, know how to convert
Getting head, bitches know potna about his bread
Taking chances in the car when he might end up dead
Mannish living in boulevard, moving real greedy-like
Shoot you in the face 'cause he really ain’t tryna fight
Put you in your place, in the dark not in the light
With the shit like toilet paper and baby wipes
Nah, this ain’t no rental, nah, this ain’t what I bought
Take you on a high speed chase 'cause the car hot

Dumpin' in the clutch, drugs in the trunk
No license and I ain’t had task for months

Stolen credit card, mayne, that’s a throwaway (AY!)
They call me Four Yard, mayne, potna, I don’t play (Nope)
I was built this way it’s mandatory where I stay
I’m sellin' broccoli and coke, tryna keep my family afloat
Me, you and a bunch my niggas in the same boat
The economy's fucked up, it’s fucked up, I can’t vote
'Cause I got priors and plus a jail record long as a rope
I’m tired of being broke, doin' the opposite of soap
Wanna turn my life around, when it ain’t no antidote
Grandmama saved, sanctified, filled with the Holy Ghost
They be prayin' for me, askin' God to keep me close
I’ll be doin' the most, hecka hard-headed until they get me
Don't believe fat meat greasy, doin' a buck 50 up in a 65 mile per hour (Zone)
Finger on my pistol (Chrome), bust you in yo' fuckin' (Dome)
You niggas betta leave me 'lone (Leave me 'lone)

Some cars are stolen for transportation or get away from a crime scene

Have the story straight, nigga, if we slide up on a black and white
Open container, a muthafucka run a red light

Hot whip, fuck them hoes, they high cappin'
Any nigga play that game, acrobatin'
Flipped from the impact, all with my seat back
I don't know the registered owner, I'm in a firecracker
There’s a bag in d trunk, avoid capture
Bitch run fast in heels, she know the throw-off method
So she protected (She protected)
Ridin' 'round with that phone blurpin', time to switch that line
I keep that GPS off all the time
I'm through the hood wit' it, so they label my car
High speed potential, D-boy at large
Too much luggage, we take a cab to the headquarters
Then bounce back with halfs and quarters, taking orders

When you sitting up high you better ride with that fire
Cause I get down (ya gotta get down)
Cause I get down (I get down)
Shit it'll get ugly round here on these folk on cycles
When I see my punk I'm turning off his lights
Cause I get down (ya gotta get down)
Cause I get down (I get down)

My necklace real, I'm iced out
Riding on a Ferris wheels finna turn it out
Sliding by the function with my beat on slump
Pounding, sounding like Chewbacca in the trunk
Clowning, making my presents known
Campaigning in my two-tone talking on my findo
Smoking on some story tell outta my whips
Billing like a trillion bucks having my chips

I make love to the block then kiss the corner
Ride up hop shots put the hot shit on ya
In this California hard-heads don't mind
Let the nina nine Nicky nit the neck one time
Respect my shine and let the sixes talk
I knock a nigga down that a fix his walk
Got the sickest hunk I put the beam on the eagle
Get's down and I don't like people


The thrill of victory and the agony of defeat
Can't be seven days, can't be week
Gotta be a beast on these streets like a tyrannosaurus rex
Can't be soft like a box of Kleenex
Uhh, digital beam chasing the dream turkey bags and cream
Living like a king, thumper by my screen
Don't wanna be broke like a lebby now that I'm having my feddi
She tryna throw me the monkey, she tryna give me the panties

She tryna give me the panties but I don't want it I sell it
I let the suckas get with it so they can hit it and dell it
I run the sliver then mail it and when they smell it it's good
85 hundred when they land in the hood
I'm a beast with the mouthpiece goon with the spoon
Hundred thousand cash in the hotel room
I got kicks in the tie but the fire with me
And I can dim your headlights it's on sight with me


My lil niggas is I'll be on some sick shit
Knock a nigga down and then go smoke a cigarette
Pitching from the mount Vallejo's most ignorant
Thirty forty rounds do is legumes
I got some bitches that love a pimp I'm try'na get paid
They can suck the yellow yolk up out of the egg
On the track with legs big tittes and ass
And the swan bitch get the money fast
I can't slow down all gas no brakes
No refunds and no we bake
So come get some cause we get cake
No mistake chef the ruby and flake

Let Him Have It,Federal,1993.0,"I never stayed my ass home I always thought that I was grown
In the traffic I was gone you see my head was made of stone
Got a problem with me?
Then feel free muthafucka Don't be talkin under yo breath
Cuz that might be the cause of your death
Cuz I'mma quick to stop a nigga in his tracks main
So lets get this shit out in the open
I used to like to go from the shoulders get em up, one on ones
Now it's a whole different ball game niggas that carry guns
A sucka will kill you first, and you will be layin in the hurst
Takin a deep ass sleep knowin it wasn't worth
Provin you wasn't a punk
Niggas don't want to thump
Niggas just want to funk and shot up a niggas trunk
I met a bitch last week at the Orgen Room
Bought her a drink and said ""whats up on the telly room?""
Just then I felt some trouble kickin' in
Spotted her X-boyfriend who had just got out the pen
Muthafuckas get to baulkin' when the liquor's talkin
Drunk muthafucka step on my toe and kept on walkin'
I said ""what's up with you partner, say excuse me or somethin""
He turned around looked at me and started mean muggin'
I guess he thought he pumped fear until I said
""Nigga don't you know I'll have you touchin' everything in here""
He went for his pistol and didn't know I was strappin'
Dag nab it, I had to let him have it

What type of nigga did he think you was E?
I know he didn't think that you were some kind of peanut or somethin'
He must of been retarded to the fact that you get a thrill out of killin'
But now tell me somethin': why do muthafuckas always wait till that nigga commits himself to realize that a hillside hillbilly is the wrong type of nigga to fuck with?
E do you feel me?
**Yeah, I feel ya sohab**
Well let's take it to the next page then
**Oh you mean that part about the dungeon?**
You Knoowww!!!

The next morning, I'm sittin in the dungeon-wonderin
Should I be dissed? Nope, I did it in self defense
I wasn't twisted, I hadn't even started yet
It happened to fast before someone could stop me
I wish I had some dank weed
While I wait out these 24 more hours before I plead
Freedom I'm gonna miss ya (I wish I had some dice)
Made me some dice out of some water and toilet tissue
Now this the part that's fucked up
I walks into the dayroom manner room, umm what the fuck?
I never thought that I would straight make ah
The front page of the newspaper
Man they 'bout to send me up state ah
Talking that shit about makin me a muthafuckin' faggot
I make a shank outta plastic and let a nigga have it

That's what's really goin' down
Cause when a muthafucka's down for the count
You gotta be about it or be without it
Cause a muthafucka once told me when you see a mark sleep
Leave him sleep in the middle of the street
If you can't stand the heat stay up out the kitchen

Now I'm still in the county's face
Fighting this funky ass 187 case
Shoot me a kite that's a good way to mingle
I'll be in this bitch eatin' shit on the fuckin' shingle
Gettin big as a house- bulkin' up
400 club waiting for the Mercedes deep roll it up
My dream came true after almost 2 years of incarceration
Now I'm out drinkin' brew
Havin' fun with my folks
Lovin' everybody gettin' twisted and crackin' jokes
Huggin' anybody cryin'
I missed every nigga in my clique and I ain't lyin'
We bones out to a party
I'm on P-role but what can I say
I can't let em know I'm stuck
I roast bitches but I'm not a damn peanut
Now I'm at the party thought I wasn't
Dancin' with the dead nigga's fine ass cousin
I wonder if she thinkin' my my my
The bitch been lovin me ever since Hogan High
She had some hard ass cousins that wasn't wit it
They went out they way to make sure that I didn't get it
But now tricks is for kids silly rabbit
I had to let 'em have

Blitzed, out of my wits, drivin' drunk
Let's see I done hit one, two, three, ain't no tellin' how many skunk
In and out of the holding cell, blood alcohol like a warrior
And I refuse to answer any questions without the advisory of my lawyer

I been in it, all around it, co-founded
Did it when I done it, I musta been blunted
Ninety-six hundred for the two P's

The Corruptor’s Execution,The Corruptor: The Soundtrack,UnKnown,"Hold up..
It's the motherfuckin Corruptor!
Since I came I was a hustler
It's a shame, I got to blow out niggas brains
To make these motherfuckers peep my game
I let em hang To the flo', snot on the snow
And full of kicked on rivals, It's for survival
In the intestines of the city, cause the game's shitty
And Piggly Wiggly on the payroll, So they can't bust us
And we shine like diamond clusters
'Cause we some made motherfuckers

Because I take out my weapon and I quickly start bustin
I go, cold loco lay em down by the dozen
I look at my riders, they say nothing's confusin
Why why why? (It's the Corruptor's execution)
(It's the Corruptor's execution)

I be workin and twerkin
My portable digital triple beamer scale like a teeter-totter!
(Teeter-totter!) Kind of like a see-saw, up and down (up and down!)
A hundred and twelve milligrams of some of that there soft white
Baby powder, equals a quarter pound
Heat up in the garbage dumpster, ""Who's sack is dat?""
All the tiffles and po'po' (and what happened) I got it back
(BITCH!) Don't make me do ya (don't make me do ya..)
I know these streets, like the Gracies know jujitsu

Because I take out my weapon and I quickly start bustin
I go, cold loco lay em down by the dozen
I look at my riders, they say nothing's confusin
Why why why? (It's the Corruptor's execution)
(It's the Corruptor's execution)

I'm havin small change, with gats and hundred sacks
I got to ball main (ball main) with thangs, I let em hang
It ain't at all strange (at all strange) with game, remain the Savage
And cabbage, got to come, if not, five-oh for one
I come with guns smokin' (guns smokin') leave you croakin' in Oakland
Without no words spoken (words spoken) put the Chevy in drive
And ride the block hoppin' (block hoppin) not to choke up in ?
With the strap, and the kick in the back, imagine that

Because I take out my weapon and I quickly start bustin'
I go, cold loco lay em down by the dozen
I look at my riders, they say nothing's confusin'
Why why why? (It's the Corruptor's execution)
(It's the Corruptor's execution)

Now we get the cash the stash and bash your brains
All over this dashboard
Give up the hash, and get you some gas
Who'll blast you main in fast foreward
Now BRRRR stick em I kick em, Bobby you lick em
We stole em and brick em to death
K.S.'ll go left, finger flick em, bitches is breathin
They last motherfuckin, breath
On the real how you feel about caps get peeled
I just baby deal with the talk
You backin the guns and all the law
So just hopin these bastards know that we strong
Fuckin em quick in the back with the dick then
Make sure ? don't know throw a trick in
Keep yours eyes on Nich-en
Cause we stickin' the Bic in, any sick then

Because I take out my weapon and I quickly start bustin'
I go, cold loco lay em down by the dozen
I look at my riders, they say nothing's confusin'
Why why why? (It's the Corruptor's execution)
(It's the Corruptor's execution)

Black beretta put the thirst out
See I'm rollin in my truck, dick hardest to fuck
Hit a block, and let the bitch blow on my sock
I got bass rock tips, red-nose tits
Las Vegas chips better dub out here (uh-huh)
Spend G's overseas got 'em sprung on the game (sprung on the game)
And all in Amsterdam you was hearin my name
I move raps over beats, tales from the street
Concrete walker, straight male stalker
(??) broken temple of hemp, I keep it simple
Money all mine, I give a fuck if you fine
My crew, doggish, Sic-Wid-It hoggish
Ball in two-thousand, suckers ain't allowed in
Catch me on the track with the froze up wrists
And I'll be fuckin they nose, like this (BEEOTCH!)


These bitches in competition (what what)
But ain't gon' bust a grape in a food fight
And nigga, you blowin hot air
I don't care, I keep a spare square
Bitches better beware, run up I dare you
Suga T the boss bitch, hittin switches
Mobbin old school then beatin down bitches
I'm struttin my tools, fool; give it up or shut up
Been done mess around and got stuck-up, set up
I still ride with yola copped in my cot
Impulse with chops and still be a top notch
Fuckin your nose, and yo' dome (and yo' dome)
Man Shot, let these haters know

I was intrigued by the way things ran
How it was done (what else) how a bitches mind was run
So I hollered at the master pimp, who was dressed in mink
I asked him could I buy him a drink
He said, ""What can I do for you son?"" I said I wish to pimp
I want yo' same stroll, and I want yo' limp
I want my mail to be as long as yours
Sport big cars and breakin all the whores
Load me up with your finest disk
I'm only fifteen and I'm ready to pimp
I want my hoes to pull in all the tricks
I'm fuckin they nose like this


FUCKIN THEY NOSE LIKE THIS
Aowwww, aowwww, I can feel it when you talk

Just thank you, thank you

BEOTCH! Remember me?
From ""I got a mirror in my pocket and I practice lookin hard""
I'm in the traffic pervin ridin on about a buck-oh-fever
Down (??) Boulevard
I does the thing to do peddle to the metal
Punchin on the gas, great dipped Caddy showin my ass
Flamboastin, straight out of Vallel'
But I got this mack game, comin from Oakland
Niggas love me, I'm a boss *I'm a boss)
My accountant Keith say that I should lease
But see I'm ethnic, FUCK A TAX WRITE-OFF
I'm off that St. Ide's, I got that Charlie in my deck
I'm dang near paralyzed, runnin over the yellow reflectors about to wreck
I'm seein two's, three's, oasises and mirages
Bumpin into trees, leaves, garbage cans and garages
Under my seat, military issue
Spoofed up insurance, SR-22
A sack of broccoli and a bunch of bottles, I'm grounded
Fuck around and got my vehicle impounded

Hide ‘n’ Seek,Federal,1993.0,"I'm in some deep shit, I got some niggas from another clique
On that ass trying to run me off a fuckin cliff
What should I do? Where should go?
How could I fake 'em?
Bust a bitch on that ass and try and shake em and bake em
Full speed ahead, I know they want my ass dead
Still on my bumper, makes a motherfucker wonder
All the dirt that I did, should just let them get me
Maybe its because I killed Rodney and his whole family
Revenge, I see my life flashing, niggas blasting
Brothas passing, trying to make me stay crashing
Into the rocks beside me, fucking up the traffic
17th in a Malibu Chevy classic
But I'm nothing humble, just call me Yapeez Pasano
Full tank of petro, mobbin through the fucking tunnel
Shit it's bright, I think I see some daylight
Over the night, you should have seen a brothas sides right
Fit the corners on two shoes, I'm holly G
Wrapping my shit around a fifty foot oak tree
Got out the car, seeing stars, I wasn't lagging
Ran out and hid behind a beat up station wagon

You've never seen a bitch nigga run so fast

Bouncing, sneaking, and peaking, hitting bushes and shit
Never saw, like you did in that movie clip
Steady busting, these motherfuckers ain't bluffing
I'm hauling ass and renting bullets, constantly cussing
Scared as fuck, I wasn't trying to act hard
Thumbs up, and ran in a back yard
Just as I was hoping the sliding door was wide open
Out of breath, I locked the door and started talking
I need some help, I gotta bounce, someone's after me
Please don't panic, I need your help drasticly
I'm not a G, a killer, or a rapist
I'm just a ordinary black man trying to make this
Busting my bubble, the couple didn't even freak
They said relax, I'll make some coffee, have a seat
The man said, whats your name bro
Shit I don't know, you might decide to call the po-po
He said that ain't my thang, I used to be a leader of a gang
Shot twice in my chest
I got wounds, where I've been stabbed
He took off his shirt and showed my his scab
I said damn partner, how the fuck you survive some shit like that
Like that there without going into a coma
He said the Lord spared my life
So I could talk to people like you and teach them right
I was a dope pusher, big time drug abuser
Alcoholic, dog blumer, but a shooter
All together working from the floor
I said I better twist so I can call her
Now I'm reached from coast to coast
Said to saved from the holy ghost

See y'all ain't ready
At seventeen I had a hundred dollars -- eh-eh, thousands
Chevy Impalas, ??, Cougars, lower-development housin
Who can split it, seen it, did it, been in it, done it
When y'all was tryin to walk it, see I was tryin to run it
Smoked a lot of trees drunk (trees drunk)
Locked a lot of keys in the trunk (keys in the trunk)
On my way back from the sushi bar, drinkin saki
I'se diamonded down and clusters on my fingers, like Liberace
To all my 223 spitters, hustlers paper go-getters
Seven digit figures, tymers, ballers, hillside niggas
Get yer bread.. bounce yer head!
If youse obsessed withcha wealth and it
More carats than a bunny rabbit
Pop yo' collar one time if you got a weed habit
Get yer bread.. bounce yer head!

The only way I get involved if it mean more dough
(uh-huh) Sauce Money, E-4-Oh
You know they want em, diamonds, flaunt em
Treat all my hoes like Billy Blank son and Tae-Bo on em
Whattup ma, too many G's to consume?
I spit game so I can ease in your womb
I know what you thinkin I'm just teasin the tomb
While I kick it with 40, take the keys to my room
Lobster, shrimpin, never simpin, gangsta limpin
Went from Sauce Money to big pimpin
Like bell bottoms, too much flate for some
Flow so hot got summer scared to come
But everybody on the track holdin weight
Five hundred thou', that's the golden gate
From B-K to Oaktown, pass the smoke round
Let me find out who broke now, uh-huh
There's love in the East and there's love in the West
Coast to coast G's do what you do best, just
Get yer bread.. bounce yer head!
To all my gettin money chicks if you love the song
Tell your man if he broke, he dead-ass wrong, you better
Get yer bread.. bounce yer head!

Yeah, who wanna fuck with The Last Don?
I hate you niggas with a pass-ion
Fuck around and get blast on
My niggas mad strong and they kill you quick
Come out or get hit, we the shit
Think I would lie to you bitch?
You could die with the snitch, and buried alive in the ditch
Come five with the fifth, try to slide but you slid
We the livest of clicks, Terror Squad to the death of me
Remember me? The same kid that ran triz on Stephanie
Felony's the minimal, enemies I pity you
Step to me, c'est la vie, and I'm killin you
Drillin you with holes in your chest
You opposin the best
T.S., supreme, crows on the nest

?? like what you say out here ain't nuttin nice
For brownie points or stripes niggas take your life
With boxcutters, fuck a knife, just for braggin rights
LOST IN THE GAME!! Drownin sinkin holdin my breath
LOST IN THE GAME!! Broke miserable starvin to death
Boom boom boom, BOOM BOOM!
Crazy weebleations.. BOSS BURN BROOM!
Bills, wheels, and about eleven-thousand dollars worth
Of counterfeit bills, marked money and sour dope deals
To all my 223 spitters, hustlers paper go-getters
Seven digit figures, tymers, ballers, hillside niggas
Get yer bread.. bounce yer head!
If youse obsessed withcha wealth and it
More carats than a bunny rabbit
Pop yo' collar one time if you got a weed habit
Get yer bread.. bounce yer head!
Get yer bread.. bounce yer head!
Get yer bread.. bounce yer head!
And there you have it
Three tycoons.. weighin in at 300-plus ya undersmell that?

Extra Mannish,Federal,1993.0,"I'm a little mannish muthafucka
I take after my older brother
Started off selling marijuana but now I'm selling yola
Shit was gettin hella funky at first
When a nigga was stealin a bitches purse
Ended up gettin kicked out of every Vallejo school
They clowned me like a circus
I was the little mannish motherfucker showing off in the back of the church
My momma was quick to hit me with a switch and I say ""that hurts""
Get to the house, go to my room and talk some trash
I never believed a hard head made a soft ass
Cuz I be moving fast and I'd be tryin to stash
Beat up the pizza man and then I straight dashed
Disobidient sport cut my days short
My momma got tired of takin' my ass back and forth ta court
I said ""momma I'mma straighten up for you and I promise I won't warrant""
Got me a job as a paper boy
21 dollars a month
5 o'clock in the morning
Damn I'm slavin' for the fucking white man
21 dollars might buy me some porrige Chicken George
I'm tired of muthafuckas fuckin over me
How can I find a way to make some real money?
But you don't feel me
I was tired of being broke lookin coked down
Came up off a twenty dollar put me down
Next thing you know I was up to about a quarter of a ki' rollin
Niggas was trippin' off me cuz I was a young muthafucka ballin'
Gettin my fetti on but when there was funk I had to starve
Time to fetch the choppers and bring out the U-hauls

Extra mannish
I make you vanish
I play for keep
Investigate that ass till they find out where you sleep
Muthafucka it's kamikaze
Don't even try me ahh
I bars none you best believe that I'mma bring me ah
Fully automatic Tommy with the infared say I'm sorry
Before I pump your ass full of lead and dump the body
Extra mannish, that's what people be calling me
Oh we can be cool until you get to threatening me
I loose my temper and shit my eyes turn red
Blow my top and get real hot at the head

I guess I'm a failure, I gots no future in my front
All I'm able to do is sell dope and hit the blunt
Don't ask me why sometimes I go to church and testify
The preacher preaches and I be dang near ready to cry
Repute the devil
I got to get out of the ghetto freak
Sometimes I wonder if mommy and daddy really payin me
Who would ever thought that a nigga like me
Would become such a bad ass youngster
My mommy and daddy done fucked around and created a damn monster
Why couldn't I wait till I was bigger
Before I started drinking malt liquor
I guess I was a nappy headed stubborn little mannish ass nigga

Guess who comes through, comes through
It's me the Y-O-U-N-G
M-U-G-Z
I'm just as mannish as I wanna be I pack a 30-30
Niggas wanna blast me because I'm down and dirty
Extra mannish how I'm livin and I'm fuckin my neighbors bitch an
She lovin' every minute of the dick that I be givin
Bitches on my jock , Bitches on my jock
Suckas on the block know I got a Glock
Bini caps, B-coats and all of that
I'm beatin niggas down with a baseball bat
I'm havin revenues I'm gettin paid fool
A ghetto muthafucka with an attitude
S-I-C-K W-I-D I-T

And why we turned extra mannish",https://genius.com/E-40-extra-mannish-lyrics

Shall we spit some saliva? Spit some saliva

Sparking up a bunch of commotion and static it's a habit
Bloated twasted loaded tilted when I roll it
Like the steering wheel on my Deville when I first drove it
Who the caviest and the savviest (?) striking like a pack of matches
Blood alcohol, looking level above average
Money tall player, papered up, ghettofabulous
You can ball too pimping just be about your cabbage
I don't need no iron I'm already creased
Pistol-whip a bitch with my mouthpiece
Paid for ho, on my car, fucking lease
Striking through your neighborhood, disturbing peace

Same colored tint with the bucket seats, beatch!

See I'm like a pimp, I got to be about means
Twinkied out, with a car full of TV screens

Fuck wit a boss, cuz a pit got rank
Make yo body stank, leave you lost in the woods

Way out of dodge lost a little weight but I used to be chubby nigga
Stressin' poppin' pills
Takin' more than anti-depressants I got the chills
Tryin' to get away from them fuzz and pheasants teachin' lessons
Got mo' scrilla' than I done count blessings
Since I was hills the smithins the slugs the wessons
Engine block gettin' cracked with some of them 355 them 7's
Ya get mopped as far as weapons
I ain't neva been no sucka in life
Poked an' m-mate in the stomach wit a number twice
Fuckin' around when they brought me down to be exact
On the streets I'm nothin' but up in here
I'm under dat act

Gotta git it, gotta git gone, git on out
Gotta git it, gotta git gone, git on out
Gotta git it, gotta git gone, git on out
Gotta git it. gotta git gone, git on out
The highs the speeds thew chases, the relays the laps the races
My struggle, my hustle, my pain, my purpose, my vision, my aim",https://genius.com/E-40-duckin-and-dodgin-lyrics

Tonight I’m 'bout to be sloppy, outta my mind and my body
Mayne, I'ma find me a hottie, up in the club in the party
I’m off this Landy and proper, she off that rum and Bacardi
Lil mami freaky and naughty, body like Buffie the Body
Say girl, my money ain’t trippin', baby, but I don’t be trickin'
In the Bay where I stay we be all up into that pimpin'
She want me to wife her but I don’t love her, I like her
And not only that, but I got two just like her
I’m a baller, a grinder, a whale, a top hat, a timer for real
Clout and big clientele, you could tell that I'm 'bout my mail
Wipin' the sweat off my face with a bill
A fixture up out of Vallejo
On a major scale, gettin' gouda and havin' scrill (BIATCH!)

Spits heat, listen, fixing to get treats on this beat
Watch Tech, he’s a hot mess
Pop a pillie, say somethin' silly like wasp's nests
When you fried, it sounds weird, mayne
We're sane, better yet, we're insane, but packing pure game
The tears came, then something said ""Here's fame""
Year's Strange, get Lear planes, dames don't fear brain
40 Water, they can't touch us like a vamp in holy water
I know he caught a show, but he don't know the we flow, we oughta

All I Need,Revenue Retrievin’: Day Shift,2010.0,"(All that I)
(This world)
Let these fools know
(You been so good to me)
The game's been good to me
My fans been good to me
The money been good to me
All I need though is this shit

Talkin about I be rappin off track
Some of you square suckers be tryina say E-40 wack
Do your due dilligence in your research 'fore I pimp my pen
If you ain't never lived it and done it, you can't comprehend
I'm a fixture, a factor, somethin that you ain't
Respect my rank, you got none of that, point blank
I'm one of your favorite MC's favorite MC
Ask they ass, they know me
Bet you they tell you ""That boy right there got flows and creativity
That's the big homie""
I'm authentic and real, I'm far from bein phoney
Originality is a must whenever I bust
Before I got into the rap game I was hustlin on the hush
Rock it up (?) dust, same color as pie crust
Penitentiary chances, shackles, chains and handcuffs
The first rapper talkin about triple-beam scales
Choppers, drought seasons and shit like that
I got some real niggas that'll vouch for that
Might not know how to freestyle but my rhymes'll paint a picture
Fuck bein a lyricist, I'm a fuckin game spitter
Pandemonium and chaos the price of bein a boss
That come with the package, I'm a savage, slightly throwed off
Grew up on $hort and Freddie B, Magic Mike and Calvin T
Dolemite and Blowfly, KRS and Ice-T
Melle Mel and Spoonie, just to name a few
UTFO, Kool Herc and Afrika Bambaataa, too
(You been so good to me)
The game's been good to me
My fans been good to me
The money been good to me
G-O-D been good to me
You all I need
You all I need
You all I need
You all I need

I paved the way for indie labels
Ask Master P and Birdman what I brought to the table
Out the trunk independently
Sold hundreds of thousands of records with no video or airplay
Me and my uncle St. Charles
Suga, D-Shot, Legit, The Click, legends in this shit
But hold up, it don't stop there
If I got a dollar for every word I made up I'd be a billionaire
I'm the past and the present
I was sayin shit 20 years ago y'all niggas just now sayin
I done seen rappers come and go
Get they 15 minutes of fame, then you don't hear about them no mo'
Yeah, I done had my ups and downs
But the cold part about it is E-40 still around
I don't know why these suckers keep sayin I need to get my mumblin ass out the way
When I got a passion for rappin, partner, I don't do it just for pay
You oughta come to one of my concerts, you oughta come to one of my shows
I do my old school and my new school songs and all of them bitches go
They don't build 'em like me no mo', I'm a motherfuckin pro
A living legend, collection of classics, thought that you should know
You can't erase me out of history
I'm from the same place as CC
(?) Vallejo California, if you blink you might miss it
(You been so good to me)
The game's been good to me
My fans been good to me
The money been good to me
G-O-D been good to me
You all I need
You all I need
You all I need
You all I need

Third verse, more than half my life
Since teenagers, I gotta thank my wife
Since we was little young cubs
Born in the struggle, broke, livin off of love
This is the actual, not a non-theatrical movie
I thank God for my sons, Issue and Droop-E
Even though they divorced, my mama and my daddy
My sister, my brothers, my cousins and my family
I love y'all, and my fans when they hated
Were down with my futuristic ass way before I made it
And all my real ones with some balls
Went out funkin, beefin, feudin, niggas made some phone calls
Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta - Pow!
Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta - Pow!
Ratata-tat, put him on his back
Bust a sucker head (?)
The rap game's been good with me
Stuck when me when I didn't even have a penny
You lames can say what you like
But I been in it for 22, I gotta be doin somethin right
That means I'm not a overnight
Overnight sensation, didn't happen over night
I broke barriers for independence, mayne, I set the tone
They probably won't 'preciate me till I'm gone
(You been so good to me)
The game's been good to me
My fans been good to me
The money been good to me

Won't tell a hoe what I know, I slap a bitch with my dough
I tell her get up out my mix, sour cock-hoe bitch
If some shit go down, you'll be the first to snitch
I'm a bonafide barbarian, out the Seven-Oh-Sev
By any means necessary, get that bread
Just smoked a turkey-bag of broccoli, and I'm off of that fluid
Niggas wanna pop me, but I can't let 'em do it
He Thundercat trainer, trained Thundercats to go
A pro at gettin' doe, he a GoPro
I wrote a letter to myself when I was six-and-a-half
One day I'll be sittin' on a big pile of cash
I pop my P's and she fell for the okie-dokie
Took her to miniature golf and karaoke
He did the bitch wrong, I did her right
She gave me some dome, I laid the pipe

Get it right, don't get it wrong
Me and broke don't get along

His beats be slappin' like he dominoes
He from the streets, the tar, the gravel
But he can put them words together like Scrabble
Comin' around the corner with the blapper
Marijuana aroma smoke and laughter
She told me she diggin' me like a tractor
These earrings in my ear might have attracted her

We doin the same old shit tonight

Chain longer than a budget rope lookin like I sell dope
You can have the bitch I just want the envelope
I don’t hand cuff broads, broads hand cuff me
But I ain't into domination I’m a motherfuckin G
Ugh 50 by the free up and down the interstate
Fresh up off the lot dealership license plate
Egg white phantom ridin round in the mansion
Ain't a damn thang funny I’m nicky with the cannon
You can find at the after hours on
Slap a bitch with my samsung
Amma superstar my only tick tock watch
I’m a boss gimmi space like an astronaut
Money always callin so I answer it bank roll longer than the landing strip
Bops bettys and bottles, bottles bettys and bops
Look like fourth of July sparkling tops
Bitch


I got ice all on me like a nigga playin hockey
I ain't bullshitin lookin like a liveroity
40 carrot now swear it black coffee
Damn click click pow pow
It’s to keep the haters off me
Hood shit nigga still hit the blue flame
Old school chevy swear it cost more to set it
Coco Braine man yeah I blew out the brains
Freak fest this spending like it’s loose change
Won’t stop till I get Icon status
Fifth everyday nigga I can’t have it
Need to calm down cause my neck to bright
I’m like a walkin flashlight on the same old shit tonight


I’m straight up out the tha Bay where niggas ride with the Glock box
Say me shit not when I slide by the block
Smokin on dope I got prescribed by the doc
Weed so loud can’t even I hide in my sock
Might through a big bet cause I’m high as the clock
Gettin top in the cockpit sippin on ciroc
Where I’m from niggas don’t talk
They mention it’s the Glock
Try to plot you get red dots just like some chicken pox
In the clubs be too hot we switch up different spots
And pimp in the parking lots till someone gets popped (pop, pop, pop)

40 in this motherfucker
Mobbed out with this shit man
They don’t make em like this no more
Let him show up, let him show out, let him cut up
Without a doubt

Fresh back from vacation right back into the thick of things
It’s a win win situation paper plottin my money scheme
I got clients out there waitin dirty white girl heroin and lean
Ain't no time for flakin got a little bit of everything
Pull up in the lotus and make the devious hella envious
Nope i’m smarter than the average bear rather slide through in a prius
50 miles to the gallon incognito not too noticeable. Dont want to stick out like a zit i’m not a role model or a mogul
Even tho i be hella helpin shit even buying toys for kids at christmas
But they media ain't goin speak on this ghetto celebrity now that you back in the house
The ghetto and the suburbs where the rich folks and the poor folks live
Kick back watch and observe the way the ogs moved and the things they did
Mob shit they don’t make music like this no more all i fuck with is sickwidit
Slapping e40 on pandora he be cutting up, he be smacking
I know i’m not from the bay from the midwest but i can understand every word he be sayin

Yea everybody know you
My cousin just called me from the pen
He said you heard that new 40 shit that nigga shit slapped
Front to back he on the case man help me get through my little case man 

This bitch artist a bitch manage music, operations
Nigga get rich makin enemies wanna switch or jump ship
If you can’t beat em then join em hop in the mix
It’s enough money for all of us to get
Now I ain't didn’t sayin no clown shit partna this is the bay
This may or may not be a good place to have kids
That’s what they like to play with the ks
Get on your marks ready set go tic-tac toe or tag 3 in a row
I got partnas on death row facing lethal injection
If they had a second chance they would probably come around
Jesus died for our sins repent and  you get into heaven
That’s what i telling them when they be call me collect, in they thoughts
Right now i’m drunk in public off that secret sauce
Pissin on the side on the building fuck the club on they feelings
What if they popo see that shit then i’m a sober up hella quick
Cause i’m on my second strike and all i got left is one more pitch


All money ain't good money
Cause you goun end up spending more money
And the less money you spend the less on the back end
That’s why a scared man always lose and a brave man always win
If you plan on getting ready invest your dividend
Buy a pawn shop, a strip bar, commercial parking lot
A liquor store, a studio but don’t spend everything you got
Do as i do not as i say put some up for a rainy day
When it’s dry sit on your yeah hibernate till the month of may
Dang it let the value rise like yeast when you slangin
Bitch you fuck around you get any price you want just name it
Gotta know the storm chaser, the weather man or lay day
My essay, my amigo, my compadre
Be shy, get a job camouflage stay under the radar that’s how beat the odds
Using your own products i don’t condone that or approve it
But that’s your business as long as you handlin your business you can do that",https://genius.com/E-40-on-the-case-lyrics

You know what's best for you, you better get widdit

I heard him talkin, but then he walkin, now tell me why
They never been incarcerated in a correctional facility
For doin this kinda street chemistry (hell yea)
I'm an original rapper, retrospected by plenty, hated by people
Me, 40, we took it back as street soldier
You got my back I got your shoulder
Peas and toes, tryin to make it, it's all oh's
Impossible is a hit never get caught diggin in my nose
Ex d-boy used to be a big time neighborhood rock star
Although I never owned a gui-tar
I-uh-I'm lyrically inclined with my start stutter scrilla
Type delivery, 40 and Busta Rhymes, was drinkin
And smockin hickory, on the porch one time
When I came up with this line: I was perkin
Off of some of that Carlos Rossi wine -- whatcha playa patnah got
Flows, like a latina female orgasm
Hoes, be yellin and screamin causin contractions at my
Shows, they take off they clothes and throw they pantyhose on stage
Any appliable age from dookie braids to suki braids, deal widdit

Do it to me baby, do it to meeeee!

Just do anything you want to do to meeeee!

Check it out yo
Do it to me I'ma do it to you
Rubber you glue, bounce off of me I stick it on you
Weather whatever you could never ever measure my pleasure
Dig in my treasure, be making your lungs cave in together
Blow smoke out my face, pick up the pace
Speed up the race, never let a hot joint go to waste
My dogs'll bark when your marksman trespass
You better use caution, your body parts might get auctioned
No need for you to keep stalkin, HELL but what you talkin
Have you dusted like a zombie lookin straight Christopher Walken
Shorty tried to call me and warn me and E-40
About these other corny rappers that ain't got nuttin for me
You know they all blew it, time to move it
Blow the spot you knowin how we do it, capitalize
Upgrade to gold now we platinum-eyes
Keep my flavor holy sacred and pasteurized, WHAT!


We doin this to blow through it til you suffocate, losin your breath
Til you satisfied, you know we do it to death
Ay you know we do it to keep you flippin, do it for whylin
Doin it for me to get my hustle on, do it for profilin
Do it for the love affair because I'm lovin it
When we clubbin all you hear is the live DJ rubbin it
Runnin it all into the ground, doin it for days
Do it for money, know I gotta keep my bills paid!

My reals be pokin and stickin out like nipples
The felines, be lookin at us like we some popsicles
Busta Rhyzzzimes, and Charlie Hustle, or should I say Fonzarelli
Poppin they collars and workin they star jelly

But when they need to borrow some money they ask me first
Used to be the rustiest filthiest dirty spoon in the sink
Now all the brawds wanna gimmi their hot wet pink
Tryna get ma wands up, pockets fat like the blob
Pull up on tha aff with ridiculous throb
Slap and click shift, like that old school mob
3 12's in the truck doing it’s job

Couldn’t find love at home, so I found it on the streets (ooh)

Yea they got me in the streets again (streets again)
I’m always a repeat again (repeat again)
Gotta get back up on ma feet again (feet again)

That they kissed her, all in her mouth and coochie lips
I am gonna fix her,even though in my mind I am light weight broke
In my mind I got hoe, In my mind she is my sole mate, should I break-up or elope
In my brain she is my day meds but I don’t want her no more
In my brain it a shame but I don’t wanna be proud
Now that an eye opener, a nail bitter, a head scratcher,a light bulb
Question mark, a mind bobbler, a dice throwh, crap shoot, a coin tosser, a hair riser, a caution you for a jaw dropper

Yea they got me in the streets again (streets again)
I’m always a repeat again (repeat again)
Gotta get back up on ma feet again (feet again)
I’m turning right and again they keep callin me
Like hey (x7)
The streets they be callin me

My mouthpiece make transactions
I keep a pistol real close neva know when shit can happen
The trifling bitch pillow talking now we get some action, soft as teddy bear y’all don’t kill the player’s fashion
Hoods turn on each other man that’s my life
I gave the bomber five, he told me to keep the hope alive
I slide off in the S looking like a few grand, hands red blood money, then flow through these hands
Stamp them like brand, vegetable hands, raised with hoodlums patience thin like a grain of sand
Been a man since my mom passed away on me (homie), rocking diamond chains make the hater wanna smash on me (ohh)

Yea they got me in the streets again (streets again)
I’m always a repeat again (repeat again)
Gotta get back up on ma feet again (feet again)

Slow It Down,Revenue Retrievin’: Overtime Shift,2011.0,"When I walk up in the club
I stay suit up
Got my strap up on my hip
Waiting for someone to trip
They say I need to slow it down
(Uhh! Before something reach and I can't)
They say I need to slow it down
(Uhh! But I'm used to going hard in the paint)
They say I need to slow it down (slow it down)
Slow it down
They say I need to slow it down (slow it down)
Slow it down

Freshly fitted and kidded nevertheless
I get my gear and my kicks from Manny over at foot express
I got a S on my chest for something
You got a N on your chest for nothing
I said it before and I'll probably say it again
We ain't in it too lose we in it to win
I still be drinking old school gin and getting tunned
Another word for pounted is wounded alcohol consume it
Look, still on the paper chase
Outside of the minus hustler he stay on the case
Homie on the grind chalupa in a pillowcase
All the neighborhoods and they grandma know that I'm a case
Burner on my waist, in case I gotta erase
Evaporate a hater for getting all in my face
Decapitate his potato for speaking all outta place
I live in the Bay but the mountain lions in space
BEITCH!


Couple shots of Henny I'm so sick with it
She says she wanna livewire I told her come and get it
Cuz if I want it lil mama I'm a come and hit it
You fucking with a millionaire king of the city
I think I'm Rookie Johnston I think I'm Frank Nitti
And baby girl she aight but the money pretty
I keep a banger cause some niggas they trippin'
Acting like they never seen a nigga on a television
Niggas speaking in colls we call it bird talk
West so I'm reppin' I fuck the 40 and Turf Talk
Real Bay niggas, we get real money
We in the VIP so keep them bottles coming
I'm never throwing hundreds, but keep a bank roll
I'm too fly but a nigga won't let it fold
That stylin' keep it lit like a candle
I'm never too famous I still run a phantom


Aight niggas and nigheads we gotta slow this shit down
For the real muthafuckin' playas in the house
It's ya boy Lil Jon talking to yo muthafuckin' ass
Taking it back to the ole school
Now you know how we used to do
Nigga's use to slow dance with girls and sqeeze real tight on that booty
That's what your ass need to be doing right now fool let's go
Speed it back up

Can You Feel It?,The Block Brochure: Welcome to the Soil 1,2012.0,"“Can you feel it?”

I got a plastic medicine container of that Afghani—peep
Brought rolling papers, no chemicals, no bleach
I’m about to be in there, to the point where I’mma blur my speech
After I finish this liter of yak and blow this eighth of kief
Mannish, don’t bother me, I’ll pop ya
With these 5-point-5-6’s, bust your medulla oblongata
That’ll stop ya, bring you up real proper
Spin you around like the propellers on a hiznelicopter
My name ain’t Harry, but I’m a Potter
My mouth hella dry, I need some water
One day I know I’mma die, forgive me Father
But I’m living for now, forget tomorrow
I’m a product of my environment, so I ain’t thinking about retirement
I’mma continue to push this yay, fuck a 401(K)
I fuck on squaws every day, and I get my helmet ate'n
Parole violator, my agent hella be hatin’

“Can you feel it?”

I’m high as gasoline off promethazine
And my whole team, we lean in them Cut’ Supremes
I keep a couple things, plus a mask or two
A 40 Glock with a dot in case I have to
I might blast through, chop it up and bounce
My little homie, he be on me, say I owe an ounce
I tell him ‘Catch me in the morning with your bank account
And I’ll just take it off the tab when you cash me out’
I do the mass amount of numbers, I’m impeccable
And I ain’t even gon’ lie, I’m off them edibles
You see, my niggas come through, they buy them vegetables
And out-of-town muthafuckas need their medical
I put the work in, I get them dividends
And them Benjamins become a nigga’s best friend
And everything I’m in, you know it’s off the hinge
It feel good when a real nigga win—say it den

“Can you feel it?”

“Go on and get your fuck on”—that’s what I told her
I don’t want her triflin’ ass no more, y’all can have my leftovers
I ain’t finna be head over heels over no broad, mayne, I’m too fly
I bait my hook up for another fish to fry
See, when a dude fuck hella broads, he’s a player
But when a broad fuck hella dudes, she’s a slut
And you wanna know what else—you wanna know what? (What?)
I find out that she was fuckin’ on one of the homies, I’m fuckin’ ’em both up
I tell bitches where I’m from to leave their feelings at home
And if they’re listening, they probably ain’t feeling this song
But am I wrong? Standing there looking at me crazy
I’m never fuckin’ you when these other bitches pay me
Already with the baby, come on with them dollars
I’ll show you where they’re going, then them other hoes’ll follow
I’m off in my Impala, 9-fin exact
I just revamped that, put them 10’s in the back

Some of my partners got years, can't take a day off
I stayed on my grind and it paid off

Taking advantage of their time on earth
Where they ask questions last and blast first
Ain't never prayed or went to church
Hecka confusing to the old heads, scratchin' their heads
Like ""who the fuck raised these motha fuckin' kids?""
""Where their daddys and their uncles at?""
Aunties too active, her booty fat
Hella youngstas from the trap already hit that
'Cause she on dope, she'll suck you up for a hubba sack
The streets are his family, he had to raise himself
After his granny passed, there was no one else
It's barbaric out here, you gotta watch your eyes
Where I reside, you gotta have six eyes
Two on the sides, two on the front and back
In case they sneak attack, keep a gat so you can bust back
I don't like too many people, people evil
I'm tryin' to go legit, I'm tired of livin' illegal

That's how we trying to eat, me and my fleet
Bought a microphone and start producin' beats
One day I'ma be at the Warriors game on the front seat
Like E-40, ""The Ambassador""
Thousand dollar shoes on the hardwood floor
Until then, I'ma grind 'til I can't no more
Continue rappin', snappin' off like a Labrador
Suckas hatin' I'm gettin' famous
I don't want 'em jealous of me, that's hella dangerous
I just want to drink and blow tree, I pack my stainless
I can't let 'em spaghetti me, and leave me brainless
Just got the sonogram back, I'm hella glad
Good news, I'ma be a dad
The doctor suggest that we go to Lamaze class
Life is a test, so I'm hoping that I pass

I'm a human just like you, every other day, I learn somethin' new
It come with the package, look what I do
Taught my own self how to tie my shoe
Brothers be outta pocket when they be wishin' down on their brothers
But they don't do that to the others

Put hands on The Devil, I'll black his eye
Tell him in his face he a liar

Only time we get along is when we going throu chemo

I done seen my homie grandma get beat by the po-po

Get off a magazine meet me over there by Mcdonald’s

Popped him with the K cause his pride got in the way

Them days are gone (they gone)
What happened to them (what happen to em)
Them days are gone (they gone)


I see most snow than an igloo, more blow than a tissue
Pain hurt and sorrow, my life is a novel
The neighborhood D-Boy was my role model
Wasn't breast feed, drank out the jar not the baby bottle
 like Serato, on this Landy not Moscato
Had to walk before I crawl
It's harder to get back up man it's easy to fall
My middle finger yelling out FUCK All Y'ALL
Gotta stay prayed up, please believe it
Please covering me up with the blood of Jesus
My brothas and sistas nephews and nieces and aunties
My parents my mama and daddy uncle cousins and all my love ones
Raised in the mud, in the kingpin
Had to be a hog and good with the hems
And even if you lost and you didn't win
The hood goin respect you (why) cause you fought like a man

No respect, no respect, ain't no respect
No respect, no respect, living in the worst of times
No respect, no respect, ain't no respect
No respect, no respect, what are we gonna do?
No respect
Ooh...
Ain't no respect",https://genius.com/E-40-what-happened-to-them-days-lyrics

Her needs is tequila and sprite what she likes when it’s time to get turnt
Break down a wood and I roll up a blunt
Then you a jug if you need one I got it
Won’t charge you much caz I flip my profit
My money is tall not short like a hobbitt
Breaking the launch chopper was in closet
Swapping these rentals and staying out the way
No time for recess cause husslas don’t play
Raise in the Yay  repin the CA I might be in Houston or Mississippi
Would be cribs that we roll in the studio ho
Whippin up beats like a kilo a blow
Cups in the bow farm in the air
Couple a hoes and they dying their hair
Working the pole she let em know she a pro no underwear
There she go she right there damn she blessed don’t need press
And the breast derriere she wanna sit on my lap like am a chair
I’m everywhere like gossip barbershop top topic
I’m the talk gossip haters wanna catch me outta pocket bitch


I’m ballin with my niggas, hug up with my hoes
House party killa feel like I just threw a show
Ain't no chase a hilt 3-6 on his dick
Henny in my system and a swear it make me swick
Fresh to death for real yea that’s how I live
Crackin on a seal yea that’s how I feel
Shawty show ya grill get em we the flex
Down to my last 4 try’na make it stretch
Dying to get a whip, pineapple and vodka
One shot there and shots up once she start I can’t stop em
Pussy poppin pros hit the floor from we call em
Hangin on my dick screaming she just wanna party I told her whip it up


Ugh, my cups so heavy I promised it’s bout a pain in it
I go my ride rent mobile if you ain't real you ain't in it
I put a 10 in this a 7 in that I never run out I stay with it
Turn up if you want to but guess what am goin do
Get up and leave it with an aid in it
Then I turned down, yea that’s right I said I turned down
I make sure the police ain't around me before I let this chris tree burn down
I cause I ain't try’na give the phone company no money
They ain't even want my freedom it’s about the dolla and how many they can get from me
Ugh
Bitch I pour up in the water if the store close
In my two door 50 on 4gs I told super duper low pro

Broccoli in the air, gathered up in a huddle

Gotta stay woke while everybody else asleep

Watch yo' back, and yo' front
Gotta pack the kind of guns that hunters use to hunt

I was built for this shit, seen cats get peeled in this shit
For either flappin they lips, or warrin over a chick
Either that or they snitch or owe somebody some chips
Used to flea flick and pitch, fucked around and got rich!
So damn focused ferocious, man I don't know if y'all noticed

Stanky gritty no pity, it's a killer in every city

Ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka, goes the hundred round drum
WOOOOOO, the amba-lambs, here they come
Flatlined, folks cryin, ""My baby was an angel sir!""

Don’t nothin' come to a sleeper (But what?)
But a motherfucking dream (But a motherfucking dream, mayne)
BIATCH!

They say my lick don't match my message but my message match my struggle
Used to push rock, same color as stucco
Like a belt I had a buckle, locked like a safe
Sewed up like a sewing machine, me and my teammates
Went from a sixteenth of yowder (To what?) to a whole thing of blow
Trying to get to the point where I ain't gotta touch it no more
My wish was God's command, He knew I wanted to rap
Lord, if you get me out the game, I’d never go back
Didn't wanna end up in the morgue or behind them bars
So I sold my triple beam and hit the studio hard
My rhymes was coming easy, natural when I spit it
The main reason why (Why?) 'cause I really lived it
It's a never-ending battle, squares think that I'm wack
Even though I'm twenty years strong with platinum and gold plaques
Keep listening to your bubblegum raps, you punk biatch (What you gon' do?)
I'ma kick back, count stacks and get rich

I'm faded so I'm saying how I feel

Flow sound shallow but you know that it's the real
Man, I bust moves
Cleaner than chlorine, got every bitch wetter than a pool

Penthouse higher than Rihanna hairline

We bustin' moves dynamic, Dolby digital sound
You can hear us out your speaker box for miles and miles
State to state, ready to increase my plate
Show them niggas that be quitting that it ain't too late
Watch me choose my fate, you see I'm in it to win it
Like my father, he said, ""Get up, get out, and go get it""
It's the way that I live, bust with a jab and a weave
Stay ahead of them suckas, stay havin' tricks up my sleeve
I'm on the mound, I'm on deck, forever shoutin' my set
The biggest, realest, chillest, illest, I don't know about that
But if it's about getting my issue, shit, then show me the way
Bust a move, make it happen, put me in motion and play
I get emotional, mayne, I came from nothing at all
Now it's all about living, loving, straight having a ball
Some nickels actin' back then, but now we having a feast
And ask my partner AJ, he this mobbin' ass beat

And california is hella hectic tips get sent, intercepted and redirected
Can’t be running around this motherfucker loose as a goose
They’ll turn you to a vegetable like the soup
Now i don’t condone busting a suckas dome
But if he plottin on my dome goin get his dome blown bitch
If there’s money being generated i want part of it
Keep a low profile stay low key won’t get targeted
Neva my multiplications, splitting the block and it’s booming
And if i get ever get popped or pined it’s a family reunion
I be in that bitch shootin constant sayin I miss you
Makin dice outta water and toilet tissue

Ready rockin hit the avenue and get it poppin

I Got Dat Work,Breakin News,2003.0,"My folks on the block man they got dat work
Man they got dat work? (Don't it smell so sweet?)

(I got dat work!) Yola, cavi, cream
Fuck the law, charge it to the triple beam
(I got dat work!) Young riders run the block
Bosses cook it up, chop it up and dish it out

Yo, what it is, what it was, what it ain't (ain't)
Pimp containers, let's put some paint where it ain't
Block boys, tycoons, big ballers (big ballers)
Young hustlers mayne, shot callers (shot callers)
Get off into this real shit (real shit)
There's a shortage on this real shit, I'm still here
And my heard don't pump Kool-Aid, my heart pump beer
Malt liquor, 211 Steel Reserve
Got'cha potnah hella perved, slidin through the turf like
What that is, family? What it look like?
How much you tryin to spend? What you hustlers need?
I got it all day pimp, weed hop speed
I ball like Spalding, I'm from the game
I keep my mouthpiece loaded ready to iron {?} tame
I'm so damn gone, I'm off the hanger, full of excitement
Run a credit check on ya, front you some candy on consignment
My designated riders got my back like a car seat
Got 24 inch tires on my GMC, EXT
Or should I say, ESV, extended sports utility
Black on black, SUV, fifteen inch screen TV


Self-reliant, benefits off drug-related environments
Crack pipes, needle fiends, appliances
Alcohol intake, overdose of the big quake
Overdose of that dopness make the bridge break
V-Town, central walk
Serve dope instrumental, me and my folks
Lil' homey on the handlebars
Mean mug hard like a thug on the yard
Throw my weight around mark, don't call it the boul'
I call it the bully-vard, THICK powder to snort
Turf talk won't smoke gotta dip the new cars
Materialistic, Jordans and gold watch (I got dat work!)
You want it you gotta buy dope from us
Swallow rocks through my belly that pass a rush
Throw it up, pack it in, I got dope to push
Tennis shoe pimpin back and forth to my bundle bush


Oooh! My crimey's doin a dub on the yard (on the yard)
Know all the latest developments on the boulevard (on the boulevard)
Before he went down he gave out some credit stories
Sent his enforcers and skullcrushers to go collect it
But you know how this new generation is, man they ain't havin it
Ain't no more rules, it's dirty pool
Ain't no more dudes that can tell me I'm right or wrong
As far as I'm concerned, MOTHERFUCKER I'm GROWN
I got my Sidekick, I got my T-Mobile phone
I'm talkin hella shit (hella shit) shit to my broad, she at home
I'm like where you at? (Where you at?) She said I'm layin on the flo'
She said the El-roys there, they done kicked in my do'
For those that don't know, kinda slow, need to be creased
The Elroys, that's what we named the police
I got my d-boys, hood famous {?} suit us
The ghost clears, we right back at it again
Man I keep my parchment paper bail money out of incarceration
And my lawyer too case I need some legal, representation
I'm a warrior like you be listenin to, music you can relate to
Like E-40 and them and the Sic Wid'It crew

I got dat work!

And you can blame it on the DJ

I’m on like the most requested song
In his eyes, his bitch can do no wrong
In her eyes, look like she wanna jump my bone
Give me dome, blow me like a saxophone
When I pop my P's and spit my ism and manipulatin'
I tell her what she wanna hear and make her feel great
That's mackology, make her feel guilty, not me
When I’m wrong, I use reverse psychology
When I'm mackin' and stackin', mobbin' and mashin', boostin' up my status
From a little young adolescent to a boss savage
With big dreams and high hopes to live rich and lavish
Survival skills, mannish, hard-headed, hustlin' tactics
If it ain’t no bread involved, then I can’t be involved
Unless you’re my relative or my potna, dawg
I ain't wrapped too tight but my raps be tight like stingy people
Ain’t a ratchet type I’m a raspy type like stingy P
DJ, put the record to the needle, OOOUH!

So OG but yet so youthful
They say, ""Between me and you, 40 low-key go
I remember when the nigga used to push blow
Now he on the charts and in the record store""
Puttin on my chain and pendant, poppin' my collar like a boss
I’m hella long winded, I’ll talk your ear off
When it comes to spittin' game, I’m a pro
Don’t check me, my nigga, check yo' ho
I’m about this paper, this playa sharp like a razor, won’t save her
You wanna wife her and date her and cape her like a crusader
Every time you pay her she pay me, you buy her a Louboutin
I fucked her in my Jeep, in the backseat of my Rubicon
Pussy was da bomb! Like this bubba kush
Brazilian wax, not no Barbara Bush
Smokin' and drinkin' and pervin' and swervin', that’s what I specialize in
I like 'em dark but I prefer light skin, BIATCH!

Indoor trees and tobacco leaves
Grind the weed down, no stems, no seeds
Everywhere I go you can smell the aroma
I got some lemon squeeze and a case of Corona
I’m mannish, even when I’m at work
I go to church smellin' like purp (Stop lyin'!)
You’re right, I just needed somethin' to rhyme with that line
It's ugly out here, mayne, this the sign of the times
I be knockin' that 40 Water, his beats be it
I fuck with my nigga, he say the randomest shit
I grew up on that nigga, he raised me and my clique
Taught us how to hustle and cook up a brick
How to knock a chick without liftin' a finger
Use my mouthpiece, no misdemeanor
Have money, have heart, can’t be no marshmallow
She came in the thang with you but left with me, my fella

You roll on

Ay, let me tell you about who I am, man
A-F-R-O-M-A-N
Sell more dope than Ronald Reagan
Spit rap songs like Copenhagen
I bet you wanna spin the disc again

I never caught a break ‘cause I was always broke
I never ate a steak until I almost choked
I never baked a cake unless it was some dope
I was always the opposite of soap

Tried to make a mil without a record deal
Selling tapes out the back of my Coupe de Ville
My pocketrs was skinny, I had to fatten ‘em
I went what I call “parking lot platinum”

The new old school, the Tower of Power
I taught the whole world how to pop their collar
They call Big Earl, Stevens that is
Much love to little Darryl and all my folks in the feds

Roll on
Roll on
Don’t let nobody put you down
You roll on
Roll on
Roll on
Don’t let nobody put you down
You roll on

I used to buy quarters, couldn’t fuck with an ounce
Now I write checks and watch the bank bounce
Work for the corporate world, no, never
Afroman’s so paid forever

Got stars on my team, we roll phenomenal
I’m far from the scene but control the domino
At the bar sippin’ Heem, my stroll Geronimo
Crack like that, black stack phenomenal

Man, I’m tired of grindin’, I want out of this life
My thoughts be rhymin’, they done asked a playa twice
They thought I was lyin’, jappin’ and jousin’
‘Til I bought them little niggas an MPC-2000

I bounce to the hizzle ‘cause the run was made
36 kicks, ice escapades
26 zips, got the best in naid
Two to six clips, bet your chest get sprayed

Roll on
Roll on
Ay, 40 I wanna hear you singin’ this shit too, mayne (OK)
Don’t let nobody put you down
You roll on
I want you to sing this shit too—everybody, where y’all at?

Some people see me and see negativity
Some people look at me and see positivity
But when I see myself, I see creativity
God created me and I create money
Jah man, put your hands up if you out here getting paid
Jah man, put your hands up if you out here getting laid
You using two condoms and you ain’t catching AIDS
We been making rap tapes since the 8th grade, yeah

Girls and sex, I love it to death
I can’t get enough, I’m holding my breath
I’m diving up in, I’m swimming to shore
I’m bringing her in, with me on a tour

Throw your head back back back back
Lean it to the side (Lean it to the side)
We used to be local (we used to be local)
Now we worldwide (now we worldwide)
Throw your head back back back back
Lean it to the side (Lean it to the side)
We used to be local (we used to be local)

Uh huh!
We out here getting paper, we trying to have our money (x4)

Pot, pills, heroin, cocaine
Speed, crack, crystal, the fast lane
Trains, boats, beaches and airplanes
What we sell? We sell everything. (x2)

I'm just as hard headed as I want to be
Me and my entourage, my faculty
Crazy like the glue, promethazine and Mountain Dew
Sometimes I act my age, sometimes the size of my shoe
Right now I'm hella paid, but I used to be broke like you
Bankroll overweight from selling weight, wait?
Did you say bankroll overweight from pushing weight?
Did I? Ignorant ass slap when I skate, slide by
Made a whole lotta money from pushing cake, dead right
I'm a whole 'nother gr'animal a different make - than those
Grew up with hella holes in my clothes, your clothes?
Dig in them dirty clothes to come out clean, know what I mean?
So I hopped in the yola game and bought a beam, a triple-beam?
Didn't have no income, but this is the outcome
Real life, not a sitcom
Hustlers up, busters down
Partner this the re-up, not the runaround


Gorilla in it, killing it
Making my presence felt
Beating they fucking ass, without the fucking belt
Panini a motherfucker, toast him like a patty melt
In an old school duster, and I'm doing it by myself
I got a proposition legal, not like the others
Lets put out bread together and build like the toll brothers
The banks denying modifications, foreclosures
Short sales, lets turn our money over
Invest in a couple of condos, real estate, elevate
A couple of years from now you gonna be thanking me, lets celebrate
Used to mean mug but now I smile
Everyday is a balladay
Turning heads just like a owl
Direct TV in my Escalade


I still got the keys so I'm driving it
If y'all keep buying it, I'ma keep supplying it
Deliver, distribute and whipping and selling these microphone candy bars
Did you just say whipping and selling these microphone candy bars?
Yeah I did
I got three phones, that's why I don't ever answer the phone
I got three guns, a black one, grey one and a chrome
Three homes, prolly why I'm never home
Three lungs, like Michael Phelps smoked a bong
There's three sides to every story: there's mine's your's and the truth
Niggas lose their lives every day over a booch
Niggas get popped with nines and AKs and caught loose
Trying to get their ham and green eggs like Dr. Seuss
Bitch!

It’s tuff times man
It’s tuff times, pressure bust pikes
Stressin cause ulcers gotta eat white rice
We tryna do some clean but we end up doing dirty
Us dudes now a days don’t plan on living past 30
Beef ain't neva ova it’s herit to the children
There’s damage on my soil and the sidewalks smell like urine
Saved and sanctified she was a good little girl
Got hooked back slid now she’s in the world (in the world)
In the world? yea  in world means in sin
Used to speak in tongues but now she speak in gin
Ay where my scooter gotta keep my stapler with me
What you got automatic, semi  in my private box Chevy

Tuff times, my baby on the respirator
No job, no food in the refrigerator
Tuff times, news say it’s gettin' worse
Gotta change, gotta put it reverse
Tuff times, tuff times (Yeah)
We gon' get through these tough times

I’m looking in my wallet I’m comin up with nothin
Today my daughter birthday but my pockets touchin
She say she wants a jumper, balloon, some cake and friends
But I can’t even do it cause I ain't got no ends
I’m fresh up out the oo up am I man not a mouse
Got a get a job before they let me out the halfway house
It’s me against the system, tryna get reformed
It’s the mind sometimes I wish that I was never born
Every time I lose my faith and get to reachin for my gun
I pick up my bible and read chronicles or psalms
I’m on my hands and knees askin God to forgive me
But Lord why do I have to pray for my enemies

Tuff times, my baby on the respirator
No job, no food in the refrigerator
Tuff times, news say it’s gettin' worse
Gotta change, gotta put it reverse

Folks be two faced, they’ll stab you in your back
With their best friend eased it happens due Jack
Take you from your family plot on your demise
Slicks lying scandalously element of surprise
My OG partna’s older sister she bout to go ballistic
She going through it cause she just found out her daughter is autistic
I told her not to worry it’s Jesus you believe in
Believe it or not everything happens for a reason
Listen to my spoke, I speak it from the heart
Ain't tardy yall I’m walt God gave me this art
To spit from the jaw and spill it from my gut
Give it to you raw unedit and uncut

Gotta change, gotta put it reverse

We gon' get through these tough times

He that dwelleth from the secret place of the most high
Shall abide under the shadow of the all mighty
I will say of the Lord he is my refuge and my fortress
My God, in him will I trust
Surely he shall deliver thee from the  snare of the fowler
And from the annoyance of pestilence
He shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings shall thou trust
His truth will be thy shield
Thou shall not be afraid of the terror by night nor for the arrow that flieth by day",https://genius.com/E-40-tuff-times-lyrics

And eighteen wheeler truck see relationships go wrong and its a fact
Over insecurities and communication gaps but I ain't gonna lie not only women but us hustlers
Get a little jealous accuse our bros of licking at other brother guess thats just nature

Thats why I drink wine and smoke herb cuz it relaxes me

More bass, more bass, I'm a rockstar
Let the wolfs out, mini move mean
Knock, knock, bullets flying through your front screen
I'm still in it, any nigga could get it
Yet anybody is subjected to get the fuckin' bidness
Back to the doggings, throw em on the cobnut
Mo volume that a make the trunk jump
I rock gold teeth, but not Sutherlin
I got pink slips, no stuttering",https://genius.com/E-40-more-bass-more-treble-lyrics
Prepared,Revenue Retrievin’: Night Shift,2010.0,"Ride with the thumper, pimp I ain't scared
You call it paranoid I call it prepared
I never bust in the air!
I never bust in the air! (2x)

Ooh!
A noun is a person, place or thing my mackin' (my mackin')
But people be calling me verse cause I'm about that action
I'm standing outside of myself looking at me (looking at'chu?)
Off this boat diddly bow and the eighth of broccoli
We working real limited space mane
Don't fuck around with fakes mane
Them fragile muthafuckas a get my period ass erased mane
Get rid of the dead weight mane
Before it get too late mane
I live in the Bay where they mad-ed the famous word 'playa hate' mane
I was forced to be a monsta, I turn into sumthin'
 long as I can see it coming
I take it there I keep a spare hundred round drumming
Give you a pass if you with'cha kids or ya woman
Depending on where I'm at what time of the day and how I'm feeling
But non RK outside of the club or in the fuckin' building
I'm having my bread getting my means having my fuckin' cash
Remove ya head I put it on skinnies I'll beat that ass


Watch ya drinks when ya purp (in ya purp)
Got a Oldsmobile high alert, when ya see a chick flirt
Never know cause a bitch could have a wire in her skirt
Never know cause a bitch can have a camera in her purse
Never call nobody a snitch until you see some paper work
It's a new game, tell on Hilmar he goin tell first
This is true mane, the rule done changed they need to be rehearsed
Nowadays these youngstas out here shoot you for a verse
Being scarred since they birth, no Christmas jingle bells
Parents ain't home so they raising they self's
I'm into worry I'm out the way I ain't out here stunnin' the clumsy
I don't want none of these hungry niggas to think I got money
Stay polished in them shop
Keeping it one hunnit is my muthafuckin job
And anybody would want it can get the whole catalog
The cartridge, the clip
The po-po and they dogs I might be dumb but I ain't stupid
Bia, biatch


I was remember when I was little
A lil young mustache when I got my first pistol
From my best friend potna's dad he was a loosey machine Isreal
In a Safeway paper bag
For the playa pricer nickel, cause he was doing kinda bag
He used to fuck around with the triple, once known to floss
Bragging about what he had and everything he lost
Anybody disrespect him I'm a chop they head off
On the streets he a fiend but in the pen he a boss
I'm rubber up on game not the rapper that's my past
Watching OG shoot the shit and pow-wow
A sponge it up like Sham-wow
How do ya like me now?
Wherever it is in this rapping got a silly ass style
I might be stronger than my ground (growling)
Then my Chevy on the prow (growls)
I been in the dark and loud as I wanna be, smoking on some broccoli
All the bitches jockin' me, police always bother me...

It's sick out here - 4x

It's sick out here look at the clouds
Look how dark it is out here
Look at all the cars with they lights on in the daylight
Another funeral niggas is stressing pressure busting pipes
Crooked cops want to read my rights, nothing but harming
Blowing shit like baby wipes, no search warrant
Dick off in your lig-a-ment
What they find, some straight instruments
I got the town buckled like a belt
Within a few, I bail
200,000  was the bomb had to think
Ten percent of that is 20,000
Inner-city bumping a thousand, suckas be dowsing
Finding Jerry cats and mousing, infiltrating and doubting
Uh, I don't know why we all so invious
Too many chiefs, and not enough indians
(Chorus - 4x)
It's sick out here
Sick, sick, sick, sick

There's fortune on the block
Every five minutes, here come the cops
I got a mouth full of hubba-rocks
And about 3 thou-wow in my sock
Plus a clock in ass cheek, Chairliggan's big brother
Stomach about to bust, no Medicaid coverage
In this game you can't be doofy
Got to have some game, can't be game goofy
Can't be out there claiming hard, when you soft
Squares are poking out of cars, tare that off
Take the scene that crowd
Be about your war, or a route
(Chorus)

What you gone do when they come for you
Better be ready better call your crew
If you don't pass the test, they'll put you to rest
Nigga stay on your toes, nigga be at your best
It's that thug shit, mean mugging nigga break bread
You get nothing if you ain't put nothing in

I heard they took the T out of trust, in other words rust
Where my real niggas, ain't no more of us
Quick to kill niggas, there's a lot of us
On a mission for that meal ticket on restriction
Incense burning in the kitchen, just pay the vision
Follow one time in my mixed up dirty piston
But barely working on my third uh-striking
On a good one man, everyday is thanksgiving

""Yesterday, should've been there by now""
9-4-5-9-1 Vallejo, California mail box ect. 9-4-5-9-1""
Damn, shit what the fuck is goin' on around here
Dude 'nem got some paper work out on you
They talkin' about makin' your ass disappear
Not like that, not my sa-hid-nab
They way to sharp
Guess again, you know your so-called homie
Your best friend

What I do, believe me you wouldn't wanna know
For what I did I opened up a drugstore
By all means, the scratch was the common goal
To cover team, I hooked up my fellows
Oh what it seems, some fools get some paper and trip
They stick they ass in the air just like a bitch
Now whats the definition of bitch
A punk ass bitch that sit down when he piss

Personal, life ain't no rehearsal
Personal, this is what I jack for
Personal, life ain't no rehearsal
Personal, this is why I hustle

All this shit I gotta deal with
And every time I look around I'm fonkin'
When I strap on it, now there's work to do
Blood on my hand, I took a life or two
Laid 'em down like a hog
Bucked a nigga down at the mall
Semi-autos, macks, Glock full lines
Quick to send you to the mortuary, yeah

I put this on my folks, it takes nothin' but a call
I jack for the beats or paper, cars, skank and all (dog)
Down for the cause, just like I'm down for a dog

Why you up in draws, can't no you can't go skinny dippin'
Why you lookin at me silly ho

Niggas don't give a fuck, we'll dump on you when you with your lady
Known to be vicious, a nigga will break your dishes
Get out the AK out the window blowin' kisses

Oh how you fuck around with the quietest nigga and he went nuts
See I den fucked around and been in shoot outs since the age twelve
Shot my house up on graduation day
And damn near killed my first born and my sister

I put that on my only son, my other seeds
You fuck with me I gone make your body bleed

Called us raw and his best friend again
Everyday lifestyles confused it, giving fools the blues in
In and out of the shootout, force gangs no croon out

He used to be a crip now he flamed up

Nobody hit but I can't say this ain't for him though

Pull up ask for weed hop out then pop (BOOM)
He was a hard nigga, untouchable
But them young niggas turned him to a vegetable
I just paid a fee, it's a plot of rims
Lock me in another state when they knock you down


He was a thug to the fullest
But he still caught a bullet
Chrome on him but he ain't had no time to pull it
Caught him at the barber shop and turned his fro into a mullet
That crazy shit still ain't got though to me
This is for funeral this right here's the eulogy
Round here shit this how it happen usually
That's why my nigga stay strapped up just like yo crew should be
And you should be nervous, cause I got gators
Holla about who need service, boy I got waiters
And then like fuck a tip cause they got them extra clips
Talking all that shit like you got an extra lip

I see no signs of it stopping, no signs of ending
The funk is still pending, it won't stop rendering
Can't get it out of his head, he can't stop remembering
Popo killed his daddy in front of him and his sibling
So he got issues with the law, he real militant
Racism is heavy, it still exists
They say because our queens got better coochie and we pack the biggest sticks
It's deeper than that and it's deeply rooted
Misery love company, they want it to be a divided country
The microwave babies and the millennials ain't rockin' with them old ass ways
Them ways hella old
""Fuck you mom, fuck you dad, those are my friends
You hate 'em 'cause the color of their skins
And fuck my ancestors, too, they're burnin' in hell
They killed Black people if they learned how to spell""

It's not over, it's the beginning
That old mentality ain't got no common place in our world today
It's not over, it's the beginning
Racial tension is at a disturbing high right now, bruh

I don't know what is wrong with this generation
IG Live is their line of communication
They're stubborn, they don't wanna dialogue
Funkin' for nothin', probably over a broad
It's up there, they lurkin', they in the cut
Bodies done dropped, can't nip it in the bud
A lot of talent got they life cut short

Soil politics, it go down in every state, every soil, every city
It's not over, it's the beginning
They got a different way of scoring nowadays
Ours used to be sports, now theirs is corpse
It's not over, it's the beginning
Now keep in mind there's just as much white-on-white crime than black-on-black crime

Show some respect little niggas see I'm respectable

Quick to set an example put down a demonstration
Wake you up to a rude awakening and no escaping and

Choke a motherfucker out for trying to short stop

Too many chiefs, but not enough Indians
See everybody needs to play they position

Brand new clothing line, my brand new clothing line is called Shob
Rossi wine, Carlos Rossi wine is what I drink
Not all the time but most of the time it helps a playa think
Look in my eyes, look in my eyes they the same color as garlic butter

It's over they head like a flying saucer, some of these suckers lost
Never had close encounters with the streets or the cops
My watch and my batteries, my rims and my tyres
My (?) regulator, starter and my amplifier
Old school sidin on them though
Memphis mojo, adio, hoe
Woofers, tweeters, horns, slaps
Hookers, heaters, warrants, traps

I ain't gettin fed up tryin get this bread up
Ain't nobody fuckin with me
Come from Vallejo, pimps pushin tail
Triple beam scales got keys
I know fools bark 'bout what they got
But I'm really feedin these streets
Drug, smack, meth, pills, trees
Show me what you need

I just got off the phone with my pimp partner, he pimp hoes
Say he don't want no black girls, he want some pink toes
Some pink toes? Yeah, some white girls, mayne
They easy to manipulate, persuade and play with they fuckin brain
I said, ""Man you a fool, why you do like that?""
He was like, ""Feezy you know I'm about them dollars, mayne, I'm a mack""
I gotta admit, ever since I known him he kept a bad batch
A stable of hoes, kinda like those in a pocket full of snacks
Man, we some Bay boys, till we dead and gone
We like to talk slick and sly like the Family Stone
Little one-dollarnaires with big dreams in our eyes
Waitin for things to mature, waitin for things to materialize
I know some niggas that been shot in the head - and lived
I know some niggas that been shot in the leg - and died
I know some folks, they got they top split like a bagel
For snitchin and rollin over and tellin on folks like (?)

I was born to sell, never snitch and tell
I keep stackin my cheese
Got folks up in jail, hell with no bail
The judge threw away them keys
Now I know fools bark 'bout what they got
But I'm really feedin these streets
Chip phones, laptops, bootleg DVD's
Just tell me what you need

Gotta go pick up my folks from the Greyhound station, he 33
Said he ain't had pussy since pussy had he
He went in when he was a baby, fresh out of Tehachapi
Started off in juvy, ended up in the penitentiary
Solid to the core, solidified, y'all
Say, ""40 they love you, mayne, your name good behind them walls""
I said, ""'preciate it, felly, I'm just tryina play my part
Stick to the rules and regulations the way that I was taught""
California raised a pit, not a (?) or a chihuahua
Might do it or might send it, bust your head like a piñada
If you start it I'ma end it, I got the money and the power
It's paid for, not rented, same color as clam chowder
I got my right hand on my chest like I pledge allegiance
Tweekin and trippin on how fast my heart is beatin
Sour diesel chokin and smokin and blowin and puffin all day, my son
Loved one, I'm loaded like a shotgun

Got goons on the corner, all through California
You know 40 Water runs deep
Half desperation, half determination
Hustlin is made of these
Now I know fools bark 'bout what they got
But I'm really up in these streets
Spit real game - take heed
Just tell us what you need",https://genius.com/E-40-rick-rock-horns-lyrics

Yeah, pimps up hoes down, yeah
Hustlas, playas, gangstas, gangstas, yeah
Fa shiggedel, shiggedy, uh, click shit down
What is it, check this out

Raised in the heart of the ghetto, dipping and dodging the metro
Pitching the ? and coke that's what I use to pedal
Heavy metal, a j-jack of all trays
Then you pimp, that's a hustler in many ways
Acting bad in the traffic, the hustler with the package
Serving that cha-cha, that yell, they all tragic magic
Plastic baggage, jelly jars in microwaves
Got to have it, backwoods and purple hayes
Mess around in my side of town, get clowned down
John, Jane Doe, lost and found
Everybody know this young player's about his business
Riches, chickens I pimp, but lickeness
My L.I.P.I folks be digging this
Devon, Pimpy Gear, Max Queezthis
Gorilla, Scarp Down, no conscience
In this occupation you can't be generous
Me and my fellas be bossing, dipping the pander and flossing
No matter how much it's costing we do this often cause we

We just some pimps, playas
Hustlas, gangstas

Walk that walk, when you talk that talk
Get your scrilla, be a pimp about it when you on your hustle
Have heart, have money, have muscle
Make sure your L-I-P's be on a rumble
It's like A-B-C's when I spit it
Don't even spot me on the map, 40 did it
When you dead nigga shitted in they bridges
You got a house that's sold out full of bitches
I be the proudest old son of Sick Wid It
Know I'm coming cause I walk with a limp and
Step to the ladder like a playa now I'm pimping
Never gabbles in a ho and come up with it
Navi cars and a home there's no limit
And I could rock a Prada suit and I feel it
You know I'm bout to buy a bentley in a minute
Fresh off the showroom floor when I spend it

H-I double L Side
13-24 Magazine where I resigned
1-9-7-0 Oldsmobile Cutlass is what I drive
With the same colored tent as the paint, who that inside
And hiding behind that cloud of smoke, waving they gun
Girl that's 40 and them they some factors they all one
Them playas got more paper than ?keegles? and than some
I always see them at the casino bossing and smabbing
Surrounded by a whole bunch of people placing they bet and
Sitting at the gambling table just like some veterans
Talking to they fans drinking Purken and playing Roulette and
Hold up, sweet heart, I'm not done
You know I'm from the Yay where all the game come from
I'm O.G., like the candle light grip
I'm company, Too Sheezy and Magic Mike

Back in the days when everybody was happy in they cabinet
And bags, I know you know, that it's a drought

Love the way you players ball
Everyday you're at the mall
Tell me is it true or false
Say that you got it all
Love the way you players ball
Claimin that your mail is tall
Tell me is it true or false
Verse One: E-40, Too $hort
Now I put my back end down ain't never been aside
I was havin b-r-e-a-d way before this rap game fool I been tapped
Thought you theezy, for sheezy, fools 'member
Earl, Brat, and Denell dem boys from Vallel
At every light it's automatic, BURN RUBBER
See my folkers in the traffic, WHASSUP ERB
Follow that cab it got yole in it
My potnah $hort got some broads in it
I'm always hearin rappers big ballin on they songs
I live like that for real and you'll never say I'm wrong
S-500 straight sittin on twenties
TV in the dash dippin fast gettin money
I'm Too $hort baby been down since the eighties
For the last eight years I've rolled around in a Mercedes
Lexus, trucks, drop that Caddy
Women don't call me by my name they call me daddy

Verse Two: E-40, Too $hort
K-Ci $hort E-40 times are really
I'll probably never have long money like Ross Perilli
But shit we just want an help
Don't want the whole plate
Don't put the two on the ten, don't ever perpetrate
Like a lot of these fools I see on TV
With the Armani Chanel Versus Versacci
How come we can't be broke sometimes?
Sometimes it's cool to floss
But don't buy an eighty-five thousand dollar car
Before you buy a house
They always said I couldn't rap wit my dirty lyrics
I guess they fear it, I couldn't hear it
And now they wanna call me hardcore
While I be steppin out the shower on a marble floor
I paid the IRS taxes send FedEx and faxes
This industry'll never ever see me
I work hard and don't play handle mine everyday
Anyway cuz I gotta stay paid 40
Chorus
Verse Three: E-40, Too $hort
With cold parties on big ole boats
Fools up out they people, ultrafied all-inclusive trips, Montego Jamaica
Front row seats at the Ultimate Fights, shamrock and severin
Long expensive fuh-flights, up dere in the heavens
Big ole royalty checks, humungous crib
Smokin bless and drinkin Bruno on the balcony, barbecuin ribs
The more scrilla, the merrier
I represent the Ya area
I walk from Foothill and Tray escort to Sixty-Seventh and Arthur
To Freddie B's house to make tapes with my potnah
Hit up Royal Park, we had tapes for sale
Got a paper bag full of that, can't you tell
It's funky, everybody nod they head like this
I started rappin, and everybody read my lips
I kept mackin, suckin up the game from the O
And even though a lot of rappers got the same kind of flow
I survived cuz I got mo', game than them
It came straight from the bitches, players, and pimps
It was my destiny, I came the same every time
So don't question me, I transfer the game in the rhymes
I'm not a freestyler, don't rap for free main
It's Paystyle on mine, cuz I love money main
Landrovers and Toyota, Lexuses
Six-hundred feet twelve with them big ol motor Mercedeses
We don't be savin broads, hoes be savin us
Hoe respect me in my car, baitch best to catch the bus
I keep a briefcase full of game, while y'all be ear-hustlin
Ain't no paperback pimp playboy, we ain't strugglin

Talking hell-a-loud grabbing his balls and side betting like a veteran
All my weeples just come hard, reach into my pockets
Pulled out a wad of money and I threw my dogs up on it
It's expected, cause way back when I couldn't afford
When a playa like me was leaking, had my back like a ? board
Now that I'm eating, the game done blessed me mayn
Everyday is my birthday, I'm about that ice cream and cake

I'm a guerilla meals must like Brandy

No female traits just OG boss shit
It ain't gotta to be on the radio to be a hit
I told this broad the other day 'Bitch, what do you want?
Wanna hear some solid motherfuckers or some chumps?'
She said 'Water, water, I swear on my daughter
You the best that ever done it—I put that on my mama!'
Hit you other the head like a quarter creche
I mean every fuckin' thing I say
Hella rhymes done got away, but still relevant to this day
Born and raised in the Valley J
Hooking up with my folks from the O-A-K
Rockin' the mic 'til I’m old and gray
What you niggas gotta say? BIATCH!

Average niggas talk about other niggas' business
Great minds talk about ideas and dimensions

Ask, you bitches, if your ass suspicious
We the masters spittin', take out half your district
Interact with wizards or in pools with rap magicians

You better get it on before the whole ozone gone
I got a jones in my bones for a spliff and riff and a semi tone
Until you see me sitting on my throne, I’ll be on my grind
Pep Lava go hard or go home
When the mic is on, and the light gets shown
It’s Hieroglyphics crew and Vallejo's own and on

Yeah, we love our style, 'cause we underground
But the funds pile, plus the guns go blaow
And we thug hoes out
And always slidin' up the block with some thunderous pound
We just some Town veterans
Rep it with no extra effort 'cause we never left it
But still worldwide accepted
Name a continent where I ain't respected
Hop on Fonzie shit, start firing my weapon (BOOM!)

Gotta watch me, zoom like a Maserati
Do 'em like I rock the party, this is not a hobby
Off the Rossi, giant in the game

Don’t take but a second for me to knock me a grizzle
Get her coochie hot like a griddle like it’s a lit up cigarette light (cigarette light)
Slick talk her canal, make d bitch think I’m a writer
I throw her knuckle I change up ma curb ball or a slider
Become her mentor, her manager, her financial adviser
Got d cash money but ma name ain’t Tiger
Woods cause I don’t pay hoes to give up d goods (goods)
Ma uncle was a pimp, grandpapa too, I don’ know what else I could do
But push dese rhymes like a broken down car, fuck wit d pickle jar, get ma money up up da par, real talk like Bill Marr


Uh, Cousin Fik
You know I get loose like a new pair a tooth
An I talk about fuckin more dan Doctor Loose
Drop d top on d coupe like oops
But don’t get juice cause I got d trade deuce
While d bottle full a goose trunk kick like Bruce
All I spit is venom like a brown wit cloos
I’m on a bitch hair like mousse, feel me like a masseuse I get neck like a noose
The truth, honey proof, in tha roof wit da Maloofs
Showin up, powin up, sick wid it so you know I got em blowin up
Hope from mentazine but I’m never slowin up

What'chu mean new trim? Some twenty-one and up coochie
I don't know what they be puttin' in the water nowadays but white girls got big booties
Ain't no color line I'm color blind let me stop lying mister

You got your thumper on you my nig just in case we get into some funk?
Naw remember they patted me down I put it back in the trunk
Well I got mine on me homie, and if I have to I'll shoot

Please hold up me for one reason
My money straight
Whole bunch of ice I'm freezing

So please don't worry bout me

Uhh, I'm breaking down a quarter pound on a dude who play with a Gillette razor blade
With a bucket of battery acid to throw my candy incase the po-po ray
I be beastin and I be savagin' and I be mobbin'
Any bitch nigga that got a problem I'm molly whomp
Hoes be giving me all kinds of kisses and hugges
But they don't really wanna fuck me they wanna fuck my cutlass
I be thuggin' it to the fullest mayne I push
Be all up in the courthouse smelling like Kush
Hiding in the fire truck latter mane I be gone
Every day by myself I smoke at least a half a zone
Finger on the chrome, letting it be known
Throwed in the dome, wanna know what's wrong
I ain't never play to lose I play to win
If it's money being generated then I want in
My stacks won't fold it won't bend
Brought a one room apartment (for what) just to keep my money in (beotch)


Oh yeah, my money straight
You can ask them bad bitches in my court until 8
Looking like they can't wait to put it in they face
If she ain't down with it then we plan a limit date
Plus I represent this Bay, so I gotta keep it res-ial
I'm gone off a pis-ial so fuck how they fis-ial
A hundred dollar biz-ials I'm ballin' on you suckers
Ridin' round top down if a player feeling smothered
We customs made 4's on the whip, Bentley holes sitting nice
The paint look blue but it's green in the light
We goin call that a sprite rocking D-boy ice
My D-boy swag I'm from that D-boy life
Black Ceaser be the name Black C is what they call me
R.B.O. the camp hundreds point be the army
Yeah ya boy ballin sumthing like Spalding
And it's only bad bitches that a real nigga call me


Purple in my cup looking like I'm playing posses
You can still get it with this chopper or the shotgun
My money straight off the rose and the Vodka
Errday we celebrate like I won an Oscar
Gangsta, from the city of choppers and body bags
We ride shit that move fast like it crawl that
We keep them toys all year like Toys-R-Us
You like a nigga that can't play bo's and dump truck
 I'm threw what they created ghetto broads
A trauma water cause ya trauma boy and still on call
I'm balling like the Phoenix Suns, playing zone
And make these bitches run for it, Marion Jones

In The Morning,Revenue Retrievin’: Overtime Shift,2011.0,"The slums of the big town
As packed with drama and danger
As the squalid streets of some native quarter
In the heart of this melting pot of crime  stands an oasis where one man struggles against the forces
That turned his loved ones to lives of violence and shame

OOOUH!
Sinister mob shit
Choppers all in the closet
Hydrogen lamps in the attic
Warm broccoli, spinach and cabbage
I keep sealer on the counter
Right next to the money counter
That’s right next to scale
For weighing nuts and fruits not yayo
That’s my excuse if they took me to jail
Listen to this here, cuz
Never explain to the popo and tell em' shit
'Cause they ain't the fuckin judge
It’s money on my mind, and paper I gotta get
Bitches I need to fuck, and licks that I must hit
Moves that I'ma make, and whips I’m tryna flip
Steps that I should take, be careful I don’t slip
When I was little I had to observe, watch and listen
So I could be real conditioned
And ready for the unexpected to occur anytime
I’m on my 24-hour grind
In my prime gettin' mine
Greenbacks in the making
Gouda on the line
Chalupa I be chasing
Nine by my spine
Outsmarting the popo selling dope
Holding up a homeless sign
BIATCH!

Wake up in the morning, first thing on my mind is guapo
Gouda, shooter, knock the meet up out your taco
Capo, I don’t serve, I just sit back and watch, bro
Sees llamas, Rugers, in love with my 40 Glock, though
Slidin' through ghetto on 4's, dodging them potholes
Heavy metal drugs and hoes, call it the rock show
Ooh, I’m really mobbin', no problem to get your top blown
Hit 'em up, slit 'em up, rig 'em up
Right back at it when the cops gone
Welcome to the top zone, 2-8 block, nigga
Raised by J-Mo, certified top hitter
Swisher filled with gag, got it by the Glad bag
Gucci, bet I let it sag, stuntin', showin' my ass
Flashin' on my little brothers, take your bad ass to class
Gotta feel him, can’t be mad, caught em' dippin' in my stash
No task, two tabs, I’m rollin'
I’ve been posted on this bitch since morning

Banger hidden under my clothes

When I go ham, money on my mind 24/7, damn
Kick a broke bitch out my spot like Pam
I’m a hustler in every sense of the word
Favorite days of the month: 1st to the 3rd
That’s when all the fiends got dough, so I don’t sleep
Tell my knock to spread the word, brah, I’m taking EBT
WIC cards, Social Security checks, I run through them
Dope fiend rental in the driveway right now, boy, I scoop them

Bread out her Ass, deposits all day
All day scheming on the come up, tryna get my ones up
30 round rig, wish a nigga run up
I keep a weapon, a pistol, poker or popper
Something to bludgeon a hater to death if he disrespects my propers
Work Dirty, I’m a motherfuckin' monster
These noodle spine niggas get ate like pasta

Fast laning and slumming, you can hear this hustler coming
'Round the block with hell knock, cutting up, stunting
Middle finger out the sun roof, buckled up, not loose
Ready to catch a fade, ready to put up my fucking dukes
Read to squeeze and make a neck, like this bottle of Grey Goose
I ain't never cashed a check, just street nigga loot
Mannishness, foolery, rocking hella jewelry
Local superstar, you oughta see my car
Outta sight, up to par, came a long way hecka far
And I owe it to my triple beam and my pickle jar
There's macking in my DNA, make a bitch pay what she weight
Everyday a holiday, born and raised up in the yay
A polished young brother, never been a sucker
A sharp hustler, flyer than a crop duster

We out here grittin 'bout gudda it's like a holiday
Standing out on the steps where my mama stay
Walking right up to the car, let's keep it coming
We out here slummin'

Trapping and checking my traps
Collecting and counting my racks
Steadily shooting craps, toting and packing gats
At the party double fisted, at the bar gettin' hella twisted
See that bitch right there? That's the homie bitch
But he don't know I'm hitting it
Little gutter chick, can't get enough of it
Strung out on my dick, she like to spit on it
Act classy but really a freak nasty
She like for me to nut on her cavity
It's game involved, I'm a damn fool
I'm the nigga, a fixture, my nigga I'm the dude
I've never been a big tipper I can be hella rude
Only thing I tip is my liquor and my brew
Boss status, smoking cabbage, living lavish, extra mannish
Profit flipping, flipping profit

Throwed Like This,The Block Brochure: Welcome to the Soil 6,2013.0,"E-40 in this muthafucka! (E-40!)
Coming back with that 1990s mob, nigga!
(Bring that shit back, bruh!)
You understand that! Uh huh!
(Bring that shit back, man!)
Look! Give it to them straight with that mob shit, man!
You feel?!

Wrong side of the bed, that's how I woke up
Throwed in the head, I'm fucked up
Being a minor, I wish my daddy would have never bust a nut
Sometimes I wonder why I'm here
Never freeze up
Never stop in the streets like a deer
Wildlife smell fear
Get you out of here quicker than a spaceship
The realest shit is in it, livin' it, gettin' it
On the grind, trippin’ sometimes
50 cal, fuck a 9
Take your kindness for weakness
Up and down the highway, I stay with a grudge
My family don't even hug
Born with a mug
My partner; Grimey, sell bud
""Only time I go to clubs is when I shoot up clubs,""
With the little homie from the hood, slaggin' ounces
Rode the back of the bus cause they was forced
Hung and dragged by a horse
When I say hung, not the jury and of course, of course

That's why I'm throwed like this!
(Man, I can't help it, bruh! I was dropped on the head when I was a baby, man!)
That's why I'm throwed like this!
(I gotta protect mine! So when I was 9, my uncle and them handed me a 9!)
That's why I'm throwed like this!
(All I hear is sirens and helicopters! Gotta tuck the kids in the bathtub! Bullets ain't got no names!)
That's why I'm throwed like this!
(It's either kill or be killed out here in the 'ville! These fools will kill you, then go to a club!)

Banana clip, 30 dick, extra clip
Take a sip
Don't think momma's even aware
Section 8, and WIC
Going through it, having hardship starving
Use a broom, not a vacuum for the carpet
Couldn't try no benefit card, EBT, in the inner-city
You see more children in juvie than elementary
Look forward to the penetentary
Ready, be in there with my uncle and my daddy
Living life savvy, selling candy like a cavity
Catastrophe, tragedy
Please Momma, don't be mad at me
""I love you no matter what happens to me""
That's what I told my momma, reading the Bible
On the way to a revival
Creator or idol, good God Almighty
I hope I don't catch a body
It's shitty like potty
It ain't karate
But they'll kick you when you're down
That's why I keep a frown, keep a hundred-round
Plow a sucka down if I must
Put some cheese on a head, no crust
Pull a nigga wig, no brush
None of you niggas I trust
Most of you niggas wear blush
Pussy-ass niggas, no nuts
Poodle-ass niggas, muts
Telling on niggas on a hunch
(Beeeyatch!)

(Everywhere I go, every time I bend a corner, them people pull me over and hem me up!)
That's why I'm throwed like this!
(Being from the ghetto, it was nights I didn't know where I was gonna lay my head! I had to sleep in the car!)
That's why I'm throwed like this!
(Smoking and drinking 24 hours around the clock! It ain't no love out there for a young black man!)
That's why I'm throwed like this!
(When little niggas get stressed out, they liable to play Russian roulette to see if it's they time to go!)

I need some weed, some drink to help me think
To take my mind off the pain
My Benjamin's baldheaded, they need some 
Rogaine
Going through it, a brotha trying to have some change
Know faces cause I don't remember names
Life can be good, but it can be a bitch
A lot of homeless people used to be rich
Used to have hella chips, paid
'Til the po-po and the batter-ram raid
White-collar crime the same thing too
They in the feds, I know a few
Fools in the federal, fools in the 
SHU
Locked in the bing, locked in the stew
Incarcerated like you, live it
That's why I always try and go visit
In the visiting room, picture it
COs talking to us like we illiterate
""I admit I'm not a graduate,"" that's what he say
But his grandmama taught him how to pray
Voted for Obama all day
Raised in the South; lived in L.A
Stubborn, born in the month of May
Everything gotta go her way
""Hella bling,"" that's what she say
She know I'm out here pushing yay

(Ain't no physical activity for the kids no more! Just video games!)
That's why I'm throwed like this!
(Every time I take a step forward, I end up taking three steps back, man!)
That's why I'm throwed like this!
(I don't know who to trust! Shit, I can barely trust myself!)

Hesitatin, eliminatin competitor's competition out the gate
Peruvian flake, cotton candy yams and Highway 5
About an estimated four-and-a-half hour drive, LET ME GO
Na na, can't do that, too dangerous, too young
Back off, it's a commotion, might even swallow your tongue
HOW?!? I'll tell ya later, hop your ass in this Kezy
Where we headed? Venice Beach
Gotta go pick up our greasy ex-po po martial arts expert
Money on grip and desperate, nuttin to be reckoned with
I tell you motherfuckers she's a fool
Damn she sound like a fuckin nut
Let's bust her potna and get the fuck
We smoke trees and slang ki's, off the fuckin E's
Livin life as a criminal doin a bunch of dirty deeds
(Look here)
We smoke trees and slang ki's, off the fuckin E's
Livin life as a criminal doin a bunch of dirty deeds
(Whatcha do?)
Doin a bunch of dirty deeds
It ain't gon' be no cakewalk, so whatever ya do don't talk
Others been sufficed to triangular markers with numbers on em
And bodies outlined in chalk
Bodies outlined in chalk, triangular markers with numbers on em
And bodies outlined in chalk
Call them organs, call my lawyer while you're at it
Tell my gal get that dope up out the attic
We ism, I caught the po-po tryin ta spoil it
Too much narcotics to be flushin down the toilet
These bitches talkin bout some shit I never knew about
Some shit I never heard, some shit that I could sue about
Knew I was in Pittsburgh promotin a charity concert wit my weep
And luckily a motherfucker like me
Had enough common sense to keep the receipt
35th and room service
Buffalo wings and Bleu cheese dressing, Caesar salad
A glass of wine and lots of sexin, don't you doubt it
25 percent bookworm, 150 percent street smart
Makin business, accusations only reach a start
We smoke trees and slang ki's, off the fuckin E's
Livin life as a criminal doin a bunch of dirty deeds
(Watcha do?)
We smoke trees and slang ki's, off the fuckin E's
Livin life as a criminal doin a bunch of dirty deeds
(Uhh)
Doin a bunch of dirty deeds
As soon as I could walk I'd cooked up bout half a meal ticket
At the age of 17 years old fuckin em up like that
Ovulatin in the kettle loft cos I kept watchin the game
I'd fall in the yard
Operation Desperation, go get your fetti
Daddy slingin niggas who off
In front of the liquor store tryin to get somebody
To buy me a bottle and a pack of Newports
So that a motherfucker can up-chuck on the teacher
When I get to school, restricted
So move up out of the classroom, better yet after school to diss this
Hella quick tip, wit extra manners, tie your ass up wit the phone cord
Duct tape your mouth, talk to your ass in Spanish
Describe me voice, like me no speak no English
Take me razorblade and get to choppin at your fingers
Straight killers new to my squadron
My deuce don't even know that's on my squadron's back
Godzilla ballers, a juvenile with damn man respect
Craze up off the set, pistol whippin negroes wit my Tek
Nina millimetre heater, heavy metal wet
Crushin heads and snappin necks, causin nosebleeds
A 150 percent street nigga about dem dirty deeds
We smoke trees and slang ki's, off the fuckin E's
Livin life as a criminal doin a bunch of dirty deeds
(Whatcha do?)
We smoke trees and slang ki's, off the fuckin E's
Livin life as a criminal doin a bunch of dirty deeds

Fuck a slow nickel, I want the fast quarter
(I want the fast quarter)
Fuck a slow nickel, I want the fast quarter
(I want the fast quarter)
Fuck a slow nickel, I want the fast quarter

Got the digital scale, a soup pot and some yayo
A box of sandwich bags and a pocket full of scrill
Fuck a slow nickel, I want the fast quarter
(I want the fast quarter)
Fuck a slow nickel, I want the fast quarter
(I want the fast quarter)
OOOUH!

Pushed in the game at a young age, feel me, touch me as I turn the page
Nigga snotty nose from the mud, with a lot of rage
Watched in the cage like a animal, a prisoner in the slums
With the needles with hepatitis, hookers, thieves and bums
Used to live lavish 'til they got on that there tragic magic, bad habits
Livin' under a bridge, pushin' a grocery basket (Sadness)
I didn't wanna be like them, so I came up with a plan
Can’t swim but I’m not sinkin', keepin' my head above quicksand
Went and hollered at my man, he put me up in the mix
Fronted me some tree, said ""This safer than servin' bricks""
But the tree wasn’t moving fast enough for me (So what you do?)
So I took my profit and bought me a zabba dee (Some yola?)
Milligrams I had to measure, it’s lookin' a whole lot better
Startin' to have my cheddar, no more bill collectors
Callin' my mama about her Honda, paid for (Paid for)
No more sleepin' on the floor and borrowing electricity from next door

Third down, five seconds, last quarter
Hut, twenty-five yards left, I need the fast quarter (Let's go)
They blitzin' with my linebacker, hand the cash over
Touchdown, I hit 'em with the shuffle pass, soldier
Quarterbacking for them Eagles like Mike Vick
In Philly runnin' plays with the Eagles like Mike Vick
Day and night shift, on the grind with them white bricks
Call me Terry Crews how I move with them white chicks (White girls)
Ha! Catch me up and down the Interstate
Dealer wake me and that money got a dinner date
The landlord move units, never renovate
They 22 but in out of state I'm gettin' 28
Ha! I got a whole thang groovin'
Pot full a grease, I got the quarter thang oozin'
Where my track stars? It’s a cocaine movement
Rap game lame, but the dope game boomin'

On the corner pitchin' nickels, quarters to a ki, boy
I need that fast money, fast back, fast lane
I fuck a slow nickel, I need that fast change
In the kitchen with the chickens tryin' to get the overs
Then I got the new '11 Caddy, tryna get the Rover
Got the egg money, white to the yola
Everyday money, fight for a soldier
With the Cal, don't creep like I told ya
Real Northern Cali banger nigga I fold ya
Ask Ward about me, I get in a nigga ass
.44 on the lap, I'll whip on that nigga fast

Lookin’ Back,Revenue Retrievin’: Overtime Shift,2011.0,"Lookin back when the days wasn't so easy*
You were either hustlin or strugglin
Make it or break it, would take all different pieces
And we'll make somethin of nothin

Lookin back at the times when we had to grind
When it came to freestylin we was glad to rhyme
When it was hard to make a dime, let alone get a dollar
Had to get your hustle on, knew not to ask your mama for it
When you got it you couldn't blow it
So I saved what I had in the bag, then I would go get
Radio batteries, I'd buy the cassettes
LPs, 4-tracks, wires and 
And we was down for hours, we was known around town
Come through with the crew and break the cardboard down
Heh... glide 
Then the whole thing started with the Odd Squad parties
Met E-40 at the Rap-A-Lot office
Him and Bela cool niggas with the Click that stay drunk
We was gettin Houstin high, they already had the Bay crunk
Straight up old school, wasn't no ProTools
Jack you for your jacket, and they'll jack you for yo shoes
Back then you had friends who had your back
You only had three choices - sports, rap or crack
And ah, it's a blessing to still be part of the game
And I wouldn't change one thing

Lookin back when the days wasn't so easy
(It wasn't easy, mane)
Were either hustlin or strugglin
(Workin, hustlin and strugglin)
Make it or break it, would take all different pieces
(All of the pieces)
And we'll make somethin of nothin
(That's right, mane, we'd make somethin of nothin, mane)

Make somethin out of nothin
Hey Devin
This 40, mane
Let me gas it right quick, bro
Let it tell it from my perspective, you smell me?
Look here
I just wanna spit a few bars
Listen up, family
Listen

Lookin back before YouTube and social networks was founded
A&R's'd go to the hood to find artists with talent
Recording engineers was low-key lightweight crooks
Not all of 'em but some of 'em'd take all day to fly hooks
That's how they did it back then, based on a hourly rate
The longer they make, the mo' money they make
All we wanted to do was rap, young and enthusiastic
Hopin that one day our tapes would be in stores shrinkwrapped and packaged
We used to beg the promoters to do us a favor
Let us perform for free, pimpin, mane, the money gon' come later
We knew the money was gon' come later
We was just tryina get our name out there
And it ended up workin, mane, for real though
Rehearse and practise, practise and rehearse
Me and Too $hort, Bun and Pimp C wouldn't charge each other to spit a verse
We all knew what we was worth, future legends up in the game
RIP Pimp C, way ahead of his time
Everybody wanna be that guy, everybody wanna be that dude
But everybody don't wanna pay dues like 40 and Devin The Dude
Two good dudes, old school but new school
Meet 'em in person, you gon' say, ""Them some cool fools""
Good music still around, just gotta know where to find it
The seasoned entrepreneur independently grindin
20 plus 3 years deep in this music
People always be askin me, ""40, how the fuck is you still doin it?""",https://genius.com/E-40-lookin-back-lyrics

The Mozzarella Galbani
I got more guns than the army
Can't let no bitch nigga harm me
I got that purple like Barney
I got two bitches that's horny
They say they niggas is corny
They never there and they lonely
They bought a bottle of 'trony
And now they ready to blow me
If you know me you owe me
That's what I told her for sho'
I'm a mac just like Obie
Me and my cronies and bronies
Rollies and stogies stay with the fifties and forties
That's us if you smell smoke
Cookies the antidote
Puffing that rope-a-dope
My partner's they kinfolk
They rap and they sell coke
Bust ya head like a cantaloupe
In the summer a peacoat
My iPhone is jailbroke
Leaning like the Tower of Pisa
Promethazina
Sweatin' like we under a heater
It's hot in here
All them suckers that's talking crazy
They not in here
Never tell my right ear what my left ear hear


I'm up before the sun up to work it beyond ya'
I break it in pieces and tell your auntie to run up
Shooters keep guns up, snitches get tounges cut
Talk to the peoples, and get your daughters and sons 
I'm up in the chevy, we bangin blow job Betty
I just whip up a 80, so hit my phone when you're ready
Turkey bag of the loud, we ain't fuckin with reggie
Trump the trailer with pounds and touchdown out the 
So c'mon! About to hit another Lick
'Bout a 150 bucks, for that tax on every zip
Girl, I got bottles of that lean, tax on every sip
Cause they got the Qualitest and I got the Actavis
So Im rollin' (rollin'), thizzin' off that molly
Stuntin' (Stuntin'), no one has another kind
My big homie E-40 put me on the Carlos Rossi
I stay younger than the muscle
Got the gang from Charlie hustle


Pockets will advance, clear the room
If they bitchin' with the shit, than your boy don't approve
See, Hennessy, Bacardi turns the party
Backwoods pre-rolled, club get foggy
Niggas mean muggin', well leap then froggy
Though I see why you mad, her ass applauding
That's your bitch, she flip like dolphins
We gon' work out and bounce the bed springs
No credit cards, just debit and large cash
And a real big bag, smell like a forest
I used to sell weight 'til gastric bypass
Pass with a Mac that smack your car glass
Addicted to ballin', no Timbs, ate Wheaties

She hide my rocks in her yock
Got a special place in my heart
She know how to play her part
Every time I look at you, darlin', I get a hard on
You're sexy without your makeup on, I wanna bone
Move you out the hood, I told you I would, I’m not phony
We both from the same place, grew up on fried bologna
They say the opposites attract but we gotta a lot in common
Behind every boss player, a boss woman

Down ass broad, never been a sap
If I ever needed bail, went to jail got popped
You’ll be Johnny on the spot, you’ll come and get me out
A loyalist, not just a friend to me
We was meant to be, we got chemistry (UGH)
You like it when I lay this pipe
Been around each other so long

Starting to think alike, getting our money right

California king on a California queen
My California dream, we make a good team

What Is It Over?,The Block Brochure: Welcome to the Soil 1,2012.0,"Same hood same block same city yea we all come from the same place

(same hood same block same city)
Same hood same block same city yea we all come from the same place
(same hood same block same city)
Used to be friends now we warring with  each other  tell me how’d it end up this way

They went to kindergarten together lived round the corner from each other pop warner together played sports together
His mother grew up with his mother
Now is a game of cat and mouse they hunting they tucking they barkin ducking and hiding and running
Bustin and dumping bucket and gunnin I don't know why
Is it childhood friends always end up beefing warring and funking falling out with each other over  some money or a woman?
At first nobody died just a couple of fights and some shit talking
But once somebody died its almost impossible to solve the problem its almost like
56 once they spot him in the daylight they got him coming up outta his cab split his ass in half
Walked away like nothing happened without even being noticed a couple aliens from out of town a couple of foot soldiers
Stolen toyota corolla parked down the street tank down near empty foot soldiers on feet
Jumped in the car and got windy in these streets you can't be weak can't poodle up and be too friendly
They're sneaky man they cheeky  so called friends become frenemies


Rule of thumb number one never leave the crib without packing you a gun can't be snoozing
When you feuding man protect your punk ass at all times stay wolf you might wanna get your pen and pad
While I explain the rules
It used to be unity in the hood but niggas hate to see the next nigga do good the next nigga got work
Ethic and yours ain't what it should every second a child is born every second one tooken away just a other day
A lil baby got hit with a stray bullet they poured it cut him down with a k
In the middle of the day missed they  target they got away s’why
I always pray huddled up I say me and my family members like we calling a play better
Watch who you talking around never know who know who cuz a hit can come out the blue just like the flu
Cuz ugly out here’s trifling and they betray you for some money some shit you thought your folks would never do bitch !

My little bitch drinking a dub, she just left Lancet
Put her right back on a roll she just go the cancer
Bitch keep asking all these questions like I got the answers
50 niggas I know, man i bled like the black panthers
2-2-3 struck you down, you shoulda ran faster
I put a quarter on my wrist just for speaking words
I put a tracker on my bitch thanks to them birds
My nigga Scooper and his bitch on a surfboard
Try to reach for one of us, you'll get hurt for it

So here comes the whole check don’t crack respect
Lyric from the hillside beat down pat
Take ya ass to the whoop troop ally hoop, ally hoop
Come up off my scratch jack pay me my loot
Got hoes like a pimp when I’m clowning these simps
Does that are tempted will be treated like wimps
Down and dirty about my print out, I got chin ups for a busta
Relax I’m talkin' when I win I must though
Let us suck ya booty habit it if he calls static
Don’t let me grab my terminator automatic
Do you think that I think that you got the power
Do you know that I know that you's just a coward
Eh you wanna act hard 'cause you drunk some shit
Better sober up before you make me check ya chin
Back up or backed up 'cause I can’t be moved
Give up or gave up because you was fool

“Rick Rock”
“Has a message for…”
“The Bay Area”
“To accept the message press 1”

(Ugh, ugh)
We flow for about five years ago, when we lost a down
But I had faith in the game
So I knew that one day that sooner or later it got to come back around
E-40 Water held his ground
Kept ma foot in the fast lane, flew uppidy on mesmerized
Cuz I snuck up in up out d game, you makin' a 40 Water cd
An get you penalized (penalized)I Promise you that you get your face kicked man (face kicked man)
Astonishing, you never know who know who beat you black an blue
Demolish you have you lookin' just like the bottom of ma shoe
The game, the game feeds off us (feeds off us)the industry an all the slangin speeches (speeches)
So we had to do what we like (do what we like)
Unite, come together like a fist to a mic
I'm from the block where they raise you up, tuck Glocks shot's blaze you up
Big shot niggas fade you up, I'm in the cut where they fade you up
5-0-9, you can page me but I'm a hustla
Bust you wit the Mac, never trust you wit the sack
In fact, when you ready get fetti out d Lac
I'll block patrol dead presidents an pesos, stack money an I chase hoes
I give em blues, tattooes on who to choose, quitters never win an I don't plan to lose
I check shoes, rich watch, an pocket books, been a crook
Califoolya made ya look

The lan of the hustlas an slick choppas
Ambulance gurneys an helicopters
Gangstaz an playas an street ballas
Game spittas like 40 the colla popper

Hey boy, I'm a Bay boy
An I rep every block that I'm on, every city I roam
From the state that is golden, state where the youngstas keep holdin
Feds an the narcs be patrollin
Northern California, come an take a look (come an take a look)
Crankin' off the hook (crankin' off the hook)
Everybody's crooks (everybody's crooks)
They be bringin you robberies, you can come mob wit me
We can be violent we broke plus we smoke
Blow on the best of dro, it's Frisco, now who's the next to go?
The calico would make a playa hater rest fo' sho
Califoolya, San Quinn reppin' the moe
Yeah I run up in a party mayne an rep ma district
(An rep ma district), an run up on yo boy like “Nigga what is it?”
I sell each zones (uh huh), they sell like stones (uh huh)
Frisco, California we stay off them phones (ha-ha)
An I'll show you some thangs draw down, pull out the pilly son, an show you the rain
Show you poor hustla niggas the game like turnin one into two
It'll cost you more if I'm squattin em through
West Coast nigga! (West Coast nigga!), I'm just lettin' you know
The home of Scalen, Sic Wid It, an Death Row (whoo!)
You still get that blow an that doe an wear them watches wit the tic-tac-toe (what!)


(Yea)
This nice guy role's been a God damn cover up (ugh)
We ride on yo block wit the Mac, hit a nigga up (huh)
God damn it! It's Northern Califoolya (right) this Mac gon' do ya (ugh)
I swear it's gon' do ya (yea)
The thought's all wrong when it comes to this north side (north side)
I ain't lettin  mothafuckin shit slide (nah)
Gangsta, hustlas, pimps, dope dealers (ugh), tec's, Glock's, A-R's are real nigga
We shoot through your chest (ugh), cardiac arrest
Now you floatin through the sky, may God Bless
Who am I? Mr. Ski, apply pressure, the 40 Water call mi “SKI” (hey)
The most aggressive
I was raised up where we say “blood” an “cuz”
Gang bang, slang cane, breed killas an thugs
I gave up sports, an started sellin drugs
Use to be a car thief but now I spendin love to bars
I'm a star; I was born one (born one)ma jersey is throw back, but never toss ma gun
The task force hit the dock ma moms got stopped, ironic
An rep East O but not from New York son
I get money like Suge, Master P, an Russell an build up ma franchise cuz since the money is muscle
I fuck wit the switch in the front before an everybody says “fo' sheezy”
But where ma credit go?


Northern Califoolya game
We've all been properly introduced
To uphold this yay mayne
Cuz if we don't check it from the womb
We gon' check it from the balloon
Still serve in mind I'm pushin the number one tea spoon
Northern Califoolya playin, mac's, pimp's, an ho slayers
Were made sharper than the Gillette blue blade straight out the pack
Cuz Northern Califoolya's the snake
To start the strike, clear folks an judges up have plenty of this light
So don't get caught up goin' to the spoon by noon

Because you'll be missin that coochie cuz you be on yo way to the bitter hoochie",https://genius.com/E-40-northern-califoolya-lyrics
Big Time,The Ball Street Journal,2008.0,"If I got rich one day, I won the lotto
I'll be up in the club, drunk, poppin' bottles
Imma live it up like it ain't no tomorrow
Big time, big time, big time, big time
But I got to get it my way, I know it ain't pretty
Well, I'll be doing my thang till them boys come and get me
I'll be doing my thang till I run my whole city
Big time, big time, big time, big time
[Verse 1:}
I get to it, I hustle, I get it in, trying to win like Steve Wynn
Money long like Jay Leno chin, I didn't put nothing in my government
I paid my bills in money orders when I was in the trap hella heavy
When I used to quarterback that yolla
Perm down to my shoulders trying to get it while it's good
Til the po po's headquarters up a hub station in our hood
A lot of these rappers don't even sound like they believable
But you can ask your daddy and uncle about E feasible
They'll say he the gospel, he a for real fisher
He used to cop from me, now I cop from that nigga
Had to share the same bath water with my brother
Used to argue, fuss and fight over pillows and covers
The low man at the bottom of the totem pole
Used to go the Salvation Army for school clothes
Now I'm a whaler, tycoon bro, everyday is Christmas
Record company, real estate, food and beverage dealers


Pimpin' is ugly out here, it's gross
Best friend will try to sneak if you let him get too close
The body will fall if you kill the head
What else?
Lovers turn quick, they forget who buttered their bread
What was you tellin' them?
I was just tellin' one my dudes
They threw the old rules out the window
Created they own new set of rules
When the shit in the air
Be a man, you can't be scared
But you can't be
Try to nip it at the bud before it get too outta hand
Before what?
I got some real ones in the pen
That I visit cause they my folks
Up in there programming
What they making?
Making diamonds outta soap
Just got my car up out the shop
What you got in it?
Retarded knock
Use the loot that I won at a crap game
And painted it butterscotch
You can hear me throbbing up the block from miles away
My neighbours loose it
Po-po's pull me over at least 3 times a day for my music (ugh)
My over head 60,000 dollaz a month total
What else?
Conducting business on my sidekick T-mobile


Niggas on the money on a first name basis
And I ain't ate all day, I want my birthday cake
So if it ain't about the money, you can get it out my face
If it ain't about money you can walk the other way
Cause I always been about my dough
When they see you doing good, they want to catch you slipping
Cause them boys going to look out you know
That ain't gone ever stop me, now don't you worry about me",https://genius.com/E-40-big-time-lyrics

Waitin’ on a Play,The D-Boy Diary: Book 2,2016.0,"Waiting on a play, I need some motion
Shorty super wet, she like an ocean
Glance out the window when I’m coasting
Get respect from Dubai to Oakland
See I’m about my paper, real hustler
Never worry about a hater or a busta
I play the game how it’s made to be played
I ring bells from the Bay to the U.K

Waitin’ on a play, I need some motion
Got the joog on the pills and I ain’t talking Motrin
Tough skin like an alligator
Fuck a hater, doing numbers on my calculator
Smoking leprechaun flowers
Getting higher than a cell tower
Pushing a hard line
Bosses drink wine
Wrist on froze when it’s sunny
Whole team seeing money
Always keep it solid, never acting funny
Give it to you if I got it, you my homie
Raised on the tarmac
Predominately Black habitat
Might wanna pack a gat
Fuck around and get your shit pushed back


I’m all about my paper, real hustler
Single parent, mama didn’t raise a sucka
Bank now but it used be small
Broken towel racks and toilet tissue holders hanging off the wall
A loaf of bread, a stick of butter and some milk
Concrete the way me and brother and them was built
Eager and ambitious, hoe
For real street niggas though (UH!)

These niggas ain't playin they goin knock shit down
4 niggas in the bucket (x2)

Black runners or surgical gloves, misle shapes slugs
Camp out in front of ya crib or catch you at the club
Them niggas is activated them niggas with the shit
Got offered some bread but turned it down and reverse the hit
The art of frontin neva know who ya havin the dinner with
Protect ya punk and throw away some extended banana clips
When you with your baby and your chick let her drive so you can blast
They don’t care who in the whip they might not give you a pass
Anybody can get it don’t think they won’t
What fools fail to realise it costs money to float
If you ballin make sure you get insurance bra
Get some money put up so ya folks can bury ya
It’s sick like malaria in the streets of california
Where you from might be scarier in your hood or on your corner
These gangstas where i stay ain't for play
What they would do?
-Put you out like a cigarette in the ash tray


It’s get’s nasty when it’s dry and ain't no work on the gravel
A lot of bullets start fly but no names in the gun battle
Innocent people get hit when the hot ones travel
They’ll be no chicken when you beefin like a cattle
Sds and 
mmb
’s what i tote (tote)
Ready at all times, woke (woke)
Bust your head like a cantaloupe no joke no joke
Jackie h or master kush is what i smoke, no coke, no coke
Got you with the slump
Youngsta's payin homage; talkin' bout
""what’s up with unc'?""
Dumper up under my seat; incase an unexpected funk
Outta here we play for keeps, cause we don’t like to play forgive
Masterminds what you gotta be if you wanna live


It’s like David and Goliath, Daniel in the lions den
When you in it, can’t have no glass jaw or cotton chin
Violence won’t ever end, rewind
It’s been here since the beginnin of time
I try to take yours so you try to take mine
When I was young I was stupid, dumb and blind
That’s what the OG said, what he do?
Got on his head
3 days later he ended up dead
I’m talkin bout the youngster that was talkin to that og
Didn’t know the og was proven and got hella bodies
Got helium and one crawl beans and mac 90’s
Came here to take his factors out when in the 90s
Keepin his little grinders got that world
Dress up like a homeless man and shoot ya in your neuro

Instead of buying, I’mma lease me an Audi (Go ‘head)
The big body Audi fresh off the showroom floor
Put it in my side chick, she got a good credit score (800)
Living above my means sometimes but that’s some nigga shit
Fuck it, B, I’mma buy some Jordans and a brand new fit
I got clients and patients patiently waiting up for me
To return in my truck so they can get more bang for they buck
You can find me on I-5 where I usually be often
Re-uppin’ and coppin’ from my plug that stay out in Compton

He was from Richmond, one of the sickest places in the Bay
Nah, he was from Oakland, Frisco, Berkeley round that way
Over there by Telegraph? Nah, over there by Ashby
Why did they find his body in Fairfield? Don’t ask me
A neighborhood MVP, programmed to go
But everybody in the Bay Area knew he had it comin', though
His mama was a ho, daddy on blow
Never been to church so he never had a soul
But it's just an example of how that shit go
Modesto and Sacramento
Stockton and Tracy, Pinole, Pittsburg, Antioch and Vallejo
Northern Califoolya, West Coast to the death
They call me 40 Water, hold water on my chest
From the Hillside to Crest, they say my city's a mess
One minute a baby's born, next minute he laid to rest
Law enforcement under-staffed, we put the police to the test
A nigga die with two thumpers on him first time he wore a vest
That’s why (BIATCH!)

Tinted windows round here, better park that
I don’t play, I put one in ya hard hat

Player-slash-coach, I call the shots
And just like a roach, I know all the spots
I’m all in the attic and under the house
I’ll wake ya ass up with a gun in ya mouth
I switch cabs, cars and buses
Might work a neck brace or borrow some crutches

Can’t find who I’m lookin' for, I’m poppin' his cousin

It's four edges to a rectangle
1500 worldwide active volcanoes
43,000 square feet makes an acre
Big ass yard not too close to your neighbor
Twenty sheets, twenty staples in a stapler
Three to every five human beings is a hater
I'm havin' my multiplications and my arithmetic
Thirty shots fit in my extendo clip
At the car auction I bought a Buick
It cost me four racks like The Mekanix

The older homeowners can't get no peace
Seven-point-six-two's been goin' through stucco and sheetrock
The tomahawk's modified, they not stidnock
On the Black LIberation flag, three different color stripes
There's 42 dots on a pair of dice

Double cross the game, and get yo' head to' off
Disrespect the game, ya get yo' head to' off
Your faulty bitches main? A getcha head to' off
Fuck with my riches main? And getcha head to' off, beittch!

I'm erog-enous, most dog in this
Dark brown like a clot, but now I'm saucy
Hoes toss me they number like an alley-oop
But I slam it in the trash, if she ain't got, ass and loot
Shoot, it's all mine in the nine sizzle
Pistol still fizeal fine, direct hits make em retire
I ain't no liar, I put it on my flow
Niggas fuck around, they get they head to' off

What's up? They disrespect us
Them fools ain't tryin to fight no wars
You talkin about bang bang
That's the way this shit gonna go
Just let your balls hang
Don't think about just do it
Cause when you think about it
Before you know it, you blew it
I ain't got shit to lose
No mercy nigga, no sarges
Get your rowdy boys
Do it today not tomorrow
Check your inventory
Make sure you got enough ammo
It's self-explanitory
Don't let em blow out the candle, biotch!

Cause if they find you witcha crew, they pack split

She'll still serve everybody
For the cash
She likes to party
With her ass-lick pussy-lick
Dick
Lick ass

And we some grown men, we turn trill hoe out
And all we ever did was stuck dick in her mouth
We fuck wines to the millionaires
Ball players that play, you better keep your bitch out the Bay

The less fortunate
The sluts, the drug abusers
Oldest profession known to mankind
Is prostitution
When I make a zillion I resign
Just like clockwork
But you know me I'm always a day or two late
And a dollar short

I trick a bitch that love Legit and do whatever I tell her to
From credit card scams to givin head to you
So if you breathe, know what I mean, prepare that ass
For the guillotine boss, get that ass to' off
Chorus One
Chorus Two

I got dreams of a mansion with the glass block
About a million point five in the stash box
I let the beat knock, I let the ass drop
And if a nigga run up, he get ch-uh-chopped

Case number two forty six, she been in an unhappy dwellin
Neighbors steady complainin, bout the dope sellin
But they ain't never been evicted, or convicted
They ain't never been subpeonaed to court, or arrested

I tried to tell em like I once told fools what's up
Fonzarelli and the Savage get they cash and loss
I'm from the coast, where we don't play that kid shit
And niggas get they motherfuckin wig split

Ahhhhh I spits nothin less than hi-tech Lugz
We can buck on each other or we can put on the gloves
Don't make me mad let me know, if you want more spot

To the ESV Escalade with the chrome spinnin shoes?
(That's a good look for me!) Look at the way I'm movin
I'm flippin hella units, nigga this is mob music
(That's a good look for you!) Got up out the game
Still spittin major slang, holla at'cho potnah mayne!

Uhh, see the crib, see the car, see the fast life
See the pigs, see the medallion on my chest right
This ain't theatrical pimpin mayne this is real life
I spit the scriptures with vision mayne real pimpish like
You like to slap this in yo' truck cause it's real right
Hit 'em hard, never bend like a steel pipe
Blow them P's to smithereens when I strike the light
Shockin all exp-luh-explosive on the mic (explosive on the mic)
What a MIT mean, merkin off that bay-oh-bee-6
Off 7 cups, drinkin Incredible Hulks
You can tell by the lingo and the way that a player walk
There's somethin about him it's the way that that player talks
Whoa - watch the game unfold it's so cold (it's so cold)
Colder than a six-pack of soda with froze flows (with froze flows)
Bright idea with the wrong gang with lowest goals
Is like tryin to get on yo' feet with no toes


That's a good look for me! Born and brought up on the turf
Played the game for what it's worth 'til they take me in a hearse
I'm tryin to eat! I'm a turf hog
Vet in the game I had, music on the shelf
For at least a high 16, me and my car and my cabinet
And everybody on my team stackin green
Now that's a good look for us! Gotta know who to trust
In game we trust, keep it on the low mayne
Live one rule no names discussed
Real hogs makin noise in the game is us
And it's not a good look for you to hate on us
I got a clique, that got a few thangs that click
I'm tryin to make this presidential greenish flip
Cause it's a good look for me to stack my chips
And I'm chillin, I'm tryin to feed all my chil'ren
So I can get both of my lil' niggas at least a million


{*coughing*} Back woods!
Tobacco paper and turtle and Canadian herbal
Me and my people and my weeple gathered up in a circle
Jokin and laughin and smilin, all in the parking lot whylin
(That's a good look for me!) Flowmaster pipes
Look at the stripes on the hood, look at the wood on my dash
Look how I punch on the gas, look at the way that I'm mashin
And dashin dippin and glidin slippin and slidin
Bouncin and skatin and figure-eightin and drivin
And all out the window campaignin drinkin and sidin
(That's a good look for you!) All the ladies like me
They Dig-Dug me, they love me, they kiss and hug me
Suckers be hatin and plottin, schemin to mug me
Wishin and hopin and dreamin that they can fuck with me

They’ll shut you down like a breaker (UH!)
Better not get out of line
Check a hoe like a Nike sign
Ghetto pass’ll never decline
Ghetto pass’ll never decline; check a hoe like a Nike sign

Never drop a dime, never tell, never talk
Do the crime, do the time, that’s the way I was taught
They’ll rob and they’ll kill you over some dank
Materialistic shit can be replaced but lives cain’t

And go hop in the box Chevy with the slap, ay
And we don’t slap five, we give dap
I can get you hit with a finger snap (Like that)
If you ask me favorite out all my hats
I’d probably have to say my thinking cap
Hand is on my lap in case I gotta blast
And I keep at least a half a tank of gas
Cannabis card on me but my grass is in a turkey bag
Finna keep it real, I’d probably cop a new Prius before a Jag
‘Cause I’m all about the cash, man, muhfuck some swag
Hoe, I got class, that ain’t got a price tag
Say he looking for a lick ‘cause he need some bread bad

Riding with the hammer even though I got priors

Bitches call me Kevin Gates, nigga, I don’t get tired
In the streets every day wishing that I had a helmet
I don’t know who I could trust, it seem like everybody selfish
Nigga play me close, I swear to God he getting melted
The homie, he a shooter, he got bodies, man, he careless
Got a old soul, man, my game from the ‘80s
You can’t get three cent, everything is on the ladies
She went and bought a Beamer, she bought me a Mercedes
All I know is money and I get it on the daily
All I scream is ‘Pay me,’ cash is the motto
And if you ain’t got it then a nigga on the throttle
I got too much street sense and I was laced from the womb
A step ahead of the game, can’t pull a jack move

Rasta Funky Style,Federal,1993.0,"How would you describe your type of singing?
It doesn’t fit into any category that I’ve ever seen before
It’s not folk singing, it’s not rock n roll, it’s not progressive jazz, it’s not swinging
What is it?
Rom pompom goes the whompers to the cranium
Bustin out churri drums in an uncontrollable outburst, hear me out now!
One time pull me over cause they see me come past d yard, slammin so hard!
Me ready now!

Rasta funky style (x7)
A rasta funky style
Rasta funky style (x7)

Come right along, come right along, come right along wit me
Spitting up on d mic is Mr flamboyant E-40!
I likin when ma style is jaffing very sporty
Strugglin strife all my life to make a little bit a money
Give someone an inch and watch me take a 2
Can’t be nice to people, take advantage of you
Smile up in yo face and wanna get down with yo crew
I felt like I can see right through some people, no can do
People believin that the fat means greasy
Until they get locked up an get shagged into d booty
That’s when you start notice that the life is not a cartoon
This won’t happen to you, if you’re listenin to this tune


I’m labelled to most, one a d most dopest rappers in history
Inherited the gift of spit from the genes up in ma family
Pork chop I eat (yes), but liver I will not (nah)
When mommy’s cooking stew I put ma finger in d pot
She slaps me on the hand and say ‘young boy have you gone mad?
If you don’t like how I raised you then go live wit your dad’
I become quite upset, angry enough to war!
Start stompin all across the floor then I slammed ma room door!
An act of disobedience which is the wrong ingredients
All it takes is jus one tiniest form a insight from a genius
To put it in perspective, video jukebox you selected
Campaign around this town,with this beat and get elected
Hussler on the doe, hitting hard like ridd
Some of our raps are fast, some of our raps are slow
V town, California, where I born raised and grow
My favourite animated TV show, Tennessee Tuxedo

Make up symbols, can’t resist em
Now everybody sing da lingo

How come you can’t spit the lyrics from the hillside posse

Do What You Know Good,Charlie Hustle: The Blueprint of a Self-Made Millionaire,1999.0,"Freak nasty super bad, earring in her tongue
Smell good, Prada bag, angel perfume cologne
I'm tryin to have me that, lipstick by Mac
Make like a car accident, hit her from the back
My fetti might be salty but my game ain't damp, see I be hood(?)
But the only cheese I ever had, was from the goods
And man that was divided among (?) brothers and sisters
Raised without a dad
Basically we was supposed to be have to make good
But what we hadn't (?) get the gat from one of my (?)
On the tough, Uncle Bruce(?)
Hustle in my veins and lungs, sucker pump
Chickenheads squash through my hood, with good intentions
But always end up sparkin antennas on bus benches
Watchu know, whatchu say, what's the sco'?
Is it a go? Then you with me after the show
You smell? We hit the hotel, and knock boots
Taught me some thangs, like who? Like Dr. Ruth
HEY!! (HEY!!) HOE!! (HOE!!)
All up in the kitchen on the flo', feel the mantra

Do what you do good, cause you know what you know good
Do what you do good, cause you know what you know good

Uhh, rappers sport my style like they sport clothes
Then have the nerve to say they made it up, now that's some hoes
That ain't no stickin to the rules and regulationship
That ain't no man if he can't admit he grew up on The Click
On the East they got hot dogs and pretzel stands
On the West they got tacos and burrito vans
In the South, it's (??) and briscuit
What about the Midwest? The midwest, dey just love to kick it!
Top shelf, ghetto tycoon the area sponsor
Can't be seen, like Bigfoot, and the Loch Ness Monster
Dialin for dollars paper route and money counters
Scrilla scratchin paper chasin poppin collars


Do what I know good
I kick it in the hood real good
Smoke real fat big blunts
Sticky-ickies to the lil' krunks
Thirty-one double-eight-seven, that's nine-eleven
Act like you're livin

I ain't no Captain
At the bar, signin autographs on napkins
Ball til we have it all - bartender talkin about
""Last call for alcohol!""
I'm bout to get to, mashin on that (??)
If we don't get no mo' (??) throw glasses at that Moesha fag
And I'm walkin up out the do', step stuck and stutterin
Didn't even screw up and hit the floor
If I woulda fell, it woulda been embarassing
Full of that there liquor, walked into a closet

About pioneers like E-40, the legend, he livin' proof

I clean up well with my gear, my heart don't pump any fear
Another year and I'm here with a kick-ass career

The OG's try to give him advice and a little guidance
Some of 'em listen and some look forward to dyin'
Some of 'em be bumpin' they gums, not talkin' Trident
Write out a will before you bust
Put your funds in a trust 'cause retaliation is a must
Pick out a tombstone and a place where you wanna be in the earth

You havin' money, buy a crib, not a Royce

I said obliged, glad to meet you too

So tell what’s up with you?

How bout some steak and wine and an autograph?
I scratched the top of my head and then I started to laugh
Let’s scoot to my spot, in what?
My Cutlass Supreme drop, where’s that?
Outside in the parking lot, let’s scat
We’ll be there with a jiffy, now sit back

Everytime i look around somebody on the ground
Somebody done got plowed down
Somebody done got cut away man
Somebody done got
Man they doin em dirty now man
You understand me look man ugh

Everytime i look around this editorial
Look at the reason another sidewalk memorial
Another sidewalk memorial 
Everytime i look around candle light visual
Look at the reason another sidewalk memorial
This the sidewalk memorial
This is the sidewalk memorial

The high’s and lows the ups and downs of life
Funeral homes and grave sites
Bloody white sheets in the middle of the streets
Shot the wrong person now the killa can’t sleep
Gave it to him with the drum right in front of his son
Shot him in the head neck, face and lounges
You neva really know when ya time is up
That’s why i stay prayed up
When i see a bum i put money in his cup
Even tho the bum probably richer than my butt
That’s good karma, generous and nice
Little things like that can change ya life
Neva lose hope man keep the faith
Good things comes to those who wait
Let it all out man shed a tear
Spark one out man pour out some beer


It’s a new era like that please believe
People doing things that you wouldn’t believe
They try to blame it on rap they say that we mislead
The reason why the kids do pills and weed
Overdose they pass out and die
Then they parents cry and ask questions why
How come i couldn’t see it comin i am such a loser
I never go in they room or check they computer
Trickin they parents like forrest bueler
Cuttin school skippin class and they tutor
Fuck college man i’m rapping
I ain't playin sports man i’m trappin
Street knowledge bitch i’m mackin
Deep pockets hoe i’m stackin
And as the world turns to days of our lives the bold and the beautiful
The young and the restless droppin like flies


All money ain't good money
It’s cold out here even when it’s sunny
This atmosphere niggas hella hungry
To be outta here if you stunting clumsy
Can’t freeze up just like a deer
Hood cot ot smell fear
Durin hunting season everyday a the year
Always know when cowards near
Gotta be aware especially out here
Where they switch the gears and back door they peers
Talk behind ya back wait till the coast is clear
Just like a little bachelor they’ll get in ya ear
Ain't nobody stickin to the script you know
Cause dudes act like they ain't dudes no more
That’s why i pack an extra clip no pull tho (no pull tho)
Cause every other day i’m at a funeral (funeral)


Now i lay me down to sleep
I pray the lord my soul he keep
And if i die before i wake
I pray to the lord my soul he take (soul he take x2) 
Now i lay me down to sleep
I pray the lord my soul he keep

Flow Valero, same old gas
You ain’t gotta ask, the boy is heavy
8’s on the Chevy but it’s filled with reggies
I eat my veggies, greens, and corn
Knock prostitutes, fuck bitches and porn

When you’re hustling, don’t let ‘em sit in back of you
Stay in contact with the smirkish and the grimey
Been having the same plug since the ‘90s

Have a breakfast at the waffle house, cheese eggs and grits

He got the block on lock, but he can’t stop
'Cause he was bit by the hustlin' bug
Ever since he sold his first rock, or should I say dove
His plug showed him hella love, and game him a joog
He stayed loyal, never crooked like a wheel alignment
So his plug kept frontin' him work on consignment
He didn’t flam-coon, he kept it low-key
Stayed under the radar and stacked his money
But I wish I could say that about his plug, attention whore
Spent 30 thou-wow in the strip club (In the strip club)

Bought a cannabis club and a pawn shop (What else?)
A Green Burrito and a Carl's Jr
(What happened to the dude with the sack, the plug?)
He’s no longer, they murked him outside the club
The throw, the function, I ain't surprised
At the events is where most of the people lose their lives
The scandalous be scamming, plotting and planning
Standing outside of the party, infiltrating and phone pimping
(Phone pimping?) Yeah, droppin' dimes
And tellin' the perpetrator what kinda of car that the victim's driving
(Wow, that's kinda heavy. What kind a vehicle he was in?) A Chevy
(When did the ambulance come?) ASAP
But by time they got there his brains was sitting in his lap
(Dang, that ain't cool. He musta had a leak in his pool)
I know, huh, that’s what I was thinkin'
I wonder where his niggas was at when he was leavin'

""We out here starvin', my nigga, throw me a bone""
You ain’t the only one, nigga, leave me alone
What you requestin' - booger sugar or reefer?
'Cause if it's booger sugar, the price went up like a PG&E smart meter, mayne
It's a shortage and it’s dry, that’s why it cost so high
And I ain’t tryna get over, my nigga, I’m just tryna get by
I can see it in your eye, I can tell you're not a spy
My intuitions tell me that you sincere and you a good guy
So I’m gonna give you a try, and put you through the test
See if you got a hidden agenda or if you smerkish
See if you’ll surrender and give us up if you get nervous
See if you a bozo or a clown, this ain’t no circus
'Cause if you pat the game on the back, then game'll pat you on the back
My mentor taught me that, so I always remember that
That’s why I’m sharper than a Gillette, or a Yoshi blade, I'm cut like that
I ain't ever been a riff raff, or a foofoo or a J-cat, BIATCH!

Just F***in,UnKnown,UnKnown,"(feat. Bosko)
 What's goin on momma? I don't know why you trippin
 I don't know why you act this way, this way
 You already knew what it was from the beginnin
 You know how we've been gettin down
 I know you want this too
 We just friends right?
 We should never stop what we do
 We got a good thing goin baby

We're not in love but we pretennnnd
We both know we're just fu-ckin (we're fuckin)
The situation's a win-win (it's a win-win)
We both know we're just fu-ckin (we're fuckin)

Oooh; thick like a big bowl of grits, big tits good looks
I knew you had some good gush gush
Cause you look like you did and I can tell it was bomb (what type)
The type of broad to squirt when she bust a nut and she cum
You said you know I got a man but he ain't treatin me fair
He always gone plus he never take me nowhere
I said what'chu tryin to tell me, he act like you don't exist?
Yup and when he come home he smell like liquor and fish
Fool don't know what he missin, he tardy and lame
But that's his loss, and it's my game
You got a mean throat game and your coochie is serious
Pussy so good I fuck you on your peroid
Naw we ain't in love but we can damn sho' pretend to be
Get a sack of that broccoli and a bottle of Hennessy
Check into a room at the Fairfield Inn (and then what)
Fire up some purple, let the beatings begin (oooh)


Your girlfriends is jealous and sexually frustrated
So of course they hated after you told 'em how I ate it
And you know what they say about fellas with big feet
So why you wanna put my business out in the street?
They already give me extra long hugs and shit (what else)
They want your position, they tryin to scoot you up out of it
Take your foot of the gas, I thought we had an arrangement
You missin the point, it ain't gon' be no engagement
You need to play your position, or you out of the game
You testin my mackin, you out of yo' range
We just fuck-buddies, I'm just stickin and bonin ya
Get somewhere with that dumb shit, stick to the formula
I'll come over later when your kids asleep
And so some nasty things that they gon' have to bleep
Give it to you good, while he out there trickin
Make your man say, ""Girl yo' coo-coo feel different!""

 We just fuckin

Baby please stop the whinin
Let me tell out your linin
Orgasms multiplyin
Under the sun that's shinin
On-ly a fool would throw this a-wayyyyyyyyyyy (ooooh)

 We just fuckin

Don't act like you want this to end
I know you don't, know you don't (oooh)
We both know we're just fu-ckin (We just fuckin sweetheart)
We can do this and still be friends
(Yeah, we can still be friends)
We both know we're just fu-ckin (we just fuckin)
Just let me do ya baby (just let me do ya)
Just let me screw ya baby (let me screw ya)
I swear I'll fuck you all night

You know, I'll come through
I got the Astroglide, I got the larger size prophylactics
Lifestyle, oowop edition you smell me?
It's therapeutic and healin
You know we got a certain chemistry sweetheart
I come through the turf the other day
Y'knahmean they scream out - here for the hemp list
Here for the hemp list
I go pick up a zip, stop by the liquor sto'
Pick up a bottle of Beefeater and {?} grapefruit juice
Cause I know that's yo' favorite, oooh",https://genius.com/E-40-just-fin-lyrics

Pop him, pop him, and put his ass in critical
But I switched up my whole little PROGRAM
For some apparent reason THE GUN JAMMED
But I'm glad my 50 calibre didn't speak (didn't speak)
Cause I heard he had a baby in the car seat (in the car seat)
Caught him inside of the club the followin week (the followin week)
Beat him down to the white meat (white meat) HOE!

I run in the crowd in a hoodie by my lonesome (BEOTCH!)
Get on his top (get on his top) 

Merk me - that's what they callin it
Get on his top! That's what the topic is
The fuzz, the feds, tryin to decode our slanguages

A nice lil' put together, a big ass booty!
Hella niggas be gettin at her, he ain't doin his duty

Hmm they ain’t fo’ heathens so lemme buckle up an switch up Lanes
Be throbbin, knockin, tweezin, orange jellin
I got em wonderin if I’m workin or sellin
Yola white wit da dukey brown top
Lookin clean as I wanna be, killin em off stack on the mac tip
Gettin busy bout ma record shrine, hurtin suckaz dealins
Makin em wanna resign back to the drawin board, cause you know you outta line either or
The penalty’s not decline I was d score
I believe it’s a zipper the nathan, I dropped tha bomb
Cause it ain’t the season for flakin tweaked off ma tongue
Rolling them back's getting twisted an all, then I start ma clown you didn’t know
I shut it down

Like Satchel Paige I call my outfield in
Four counts bases loaded , anotha win for E 40 and the click crew
I thought you knew E.R.A. average is 00.2
Don’t need a pinch hitter cause I’m already on here about a thousand
That’s if you don’t forfeit
Don’t be mad at me though chock it up as a loss
I get saucier than Ragu spaghetti sauce
Proof is in the pudding, check your local listings for booking -me,the one an only unorthodox rapper E 40
Put here for a purpose, now tell me is it worth it ridin round startin up trouble in yo public
That ain’t even sharp at all, cause one day mom’s gonna get a call
Would-you,would-you,would-you come identify yo son
He’s anotha victim of a hot (hot one)

No I ain’t tryna knock nobody hustle but now this whole violent thang gotten way outta bounds
Innocent bystanders gettin shot up an carried off
Folks killin otha folks, chil’ren stealin from they parent, kidnappin, robbin, the whole blasé
What! you think that’s groovy? Mayne d whole world is corrupted
Check it out, partna, I know the streets ain’t goin nowhere
But now as far as we gatherin up dis information that I done learn through ma stressful strife
I wanna share wit ya’ll ya know what I’m sayin

I’m wanna shut this whole thang down on this whole violent thang
Killin up each otha mayne

A young black entrepreneur that ain’t sellin it
Gettin ma props makin ma mil though
I rather be at home than jail bro
Motivation ma brotha, gets rid of frustration
Notice how I didn’t stutter
I neva would do naythin of that fashion
I go on a 2 day fastin, meditate on nothin but positive rappin
See I take it deep, wake up in d middle a ma sleep
Get on ma knees an pray an say ‘thank you Lord for wakin me up today’
That’s on d goosh ma pal, ima get say it anyhow

I Know I Can Make It,The Block Brochure: Welcome to the Soil 2,2012.0,"You better watch your step if you want to go to Heaven

Sometimes I just wish that I could fly away
I'm strugglin' but I'm searchin' for a better day
I know I can make it
I know I can make it
Sometimes I just wish that I could fly away
I'm strugglin' but I'm searchin' for a better day
I know I can make it
I know I can make it

Uhh
When I was a boy, I had to be a man
When they told me ""I couldn't"", I told 'em that ""I can""
It's God's plan, the way that things done panned out
I got my life off the stress, so ain't no need to pout
The choir sing and the missionaries shout
But, when that church organ plays, that's when my tears get to pourin' out
Just a kid from the soil, tryna prosper
Tired of hearing gunshots and sirens and helicopters
Grew up around killers, villains and robbers
Drug dealers, con artists and slick talkers
They say that if you got talent, you 'posed to use it
All my life, I've been around music
Played the drums in elementary, all the way through twelfth
Start rappin' in seventh grade, now I got records on the shelf
Hard work, dedication, intestinal fortitude
A real hustler out the hood, determined to be that dude
We didn't get everything in our Christmas bag that other kids had
But whatever we had, we was glad
Uhh, God is good and I'm okay with being underrated
No matter what they think about me, man I made it

Sometimes I just wish that I could fly away

I know I can make it

I'm Suga-T, I've been often underestimated
A chick in the game, gotta carry her weight, or she'll get slated
I was a teen mom, an ugly duckling grown a swan
But to this very day, I remain a hip hop mom (Yeah)
Didn't always make the best choices, but that's okay
I still hold the title ""The Queen of The Bay""
It was only God's grace that I'm still alive (Still alive)
'Cause to be a boss lady you gotta pay the price (Pay the price)
I used to be quick to pull a lick, quick to check a trick
I messed around and found out that rappin' was one of my gifts (Uh huh)
Legendary, I make history still
I could take the pimpstress route, or I could pay my own bills (Yeah)
I know that I can make it, even though they're player hatin' (Uh huh)
Eventually, they'll be congratulatin', uh huh
Cash rules everything around but game is priceless
And when we die, we better hope we make the right list

Sometimes I just wish that I could fly away
I'm strugglin' but I'm searchin' for a better day

Sometimes I just wish that I could fly away

A-Agerman
I know I can make it through these hard times
I fall on my knees and cry after callin' a friend of mine
He's  through the storm and the rain
As them tears drop down your cheek he'll ease the pain
My God, 
But joy comes in the morning, you gonna make it through the night
When it's dark in your life, look towards God, 'cause He's the light that shines bright
 continue to fight the good fight
'Cause faith , the things we hope for
When hard times come, that's God knockin' at your door
Reminding us all to fall on our knees and pray
To give us hope, to let us know there's a brighter day
Sunshine after the rain
Joy comin' right after the pain
It's Agerman, E-40 and Suga-T, y'all know
We all go through hard times
But we gonna make it out fo' sho'

Ugh listen he signal for a fair catch but they still hit him
Can’t be half ass hustlin and catin off
Can’t be loose as a porno pussy that’s how you get your head cut off
Yea so you serve for some off fuck change enough to buy a flying sperm
When they call in the ballation there ain't no competition
Blowin bitches mind like engine, blowin pistin
Big spliffing smokin a taylor to the fingernail
Holdin my breath until i turn pale
Sending packages in the mail prepared to post bail
To catch me they going put a hussla under the jail
I bear it not generic man you heard me
Exercising, calisthenics doin bourbons

Front buses, bussin, smokin, puffin, suits and jumpin
Drinkin, rushin, boots and subbin
Headache bufferin, loud enough to bust your bumpkin
Beatin’ the trunk loose 

Ugh when the drama’s drawn  things sucked up sucked up
But you can deep fry it like a burrito in front the taco truck
In the inner city no pity for the healthy or the sickly
It’s filthy it’s dusty man ripley’s won’t believe it
They gnarly, they party it’s hella turnt
Play with the fire you gonna get burnt
Get faith get em up put down the weapons
I don’t don’t want that stanky bitch you can have my sloppy seconds
I drinks gin and vodka stupid poppin my colla
Got a way with my words like barak
On the toilet readin the fader
Magazine with my magazine and my cater


Ugh fresh up outta the parkin lot blabbin
My car is a tourist attraction
Fucker let me drop my drinks louis shots
Finger on my Glock blame the girls i pop
Pow pow pow made him pay
Off with his head he wasn’t using it anyway
Ugh play too much
Running aroun talkin tuff like he can’t get touched
Anybody can get it you name it i done did it
Ain't tellin on myself though i’ll never admit it
But you there saw how it ended i’ll never regret
Me and my niggas in the can fo bald headed and dreaded
Ugh heavy on the grind
That niggas name should never be mentioned in the same breath as mine

So when you go outside you better watch out for him

When my lil grimey nigga come around fools get nervous
Cause he I'll and sick as the fuck, smirkish, heartless and merciless
His daddy don't claim him even though he looks just like him
His mama been on goup ever since 1990
In and out of foster homes, YA, juvy, still ain't reformed
They say the doctor dropped him on his head when he was born
My lil grimey nigga maney, janky like tricked dice
Never been to church in his life, no conscience, put you on ice
Pack a gun and a knife, aim it right at your brain
Lookin like a plate, tuck it or you gon' get took for your chain
Him and his partners mannish body wounds mean in the hood
Came with an AK-47, pistol, handgun, assault weapon
I be tryina tell my lil grimey, ""Slow down! "" But he ain't listenin
Lil nigga hardheaded, look forward to goin to prison
Don't care if he make it to 25, he ain't trippin
Fifi, belushi, and pill, syrup and chacha sniffin


My lil grimey be lurkin and prowlin in the wee hours of the night
With the hungry man and his...
Lookin to bump heads or cross paths with anybody that he got a problem with
Lurkin at the gas station on some old floop shit
Trained and programed to go, about his dough
A hitter, not a barber but carry a extra clipper
Got hella next of kin cousins and uncles up out the Rich
El Sobrante and Hercules teach him taught him how to fish
My lil grimey nigga, all the time right behind me nigga
On the block with the Glock where you can find me nigga
They didn't see his face, but everybody knew his name
Everybody knew his name, silhouette his body frame
I wonder what set he claim? For the money, fuck the fame
Do he make it rain? Hell nah, he gangbang (BITCH)

Set to set robbin niggas, he's a floater",https://genius.com/E-40-my-lil-grimey-ngga-lyrics

My neck and wrist be shinin in the sun
All big faces, ain’t none of these rude
Out here getting it in the California slum
Because ballin is fun
Protect yourself at all times, cause niggas be on bellucian and snort wild
Real life, not a movie, hard times
Gotta be aware, pay attention to your warning signs
That’s why I life live to the end, cause you never know when it’s gonn end
Eryday my birthday, don’t worry out what I spend
This hustler got, this hustler earned it
Monster, but my first name ain’t Herman
Came in the game with nothing, got out the game with something
Was traffic out there rushing, in the ghetto out there hustling
Stacking my chips, eating my bread, strapped with the lead
They want me dead
Knocking hoe, getting some head, on a ceiling mattress bed
Took a left over from my bundle after I copped and bought a drop
More and it’s fun, I bought it with 1’s, drove it off of the lot
Wind got me some slap, and wrapped in mat black
Tinted window front and back, Pontiac, in the 20 sack

My neck and wrist be shinin in the sun
All big faces, ain’t none of these rude
Out here getting it in the California slum
Because ballin is fun
Your life is hard, times are tough, looking for money, you can’t find enough
You try rapping, but nobody signed you up
Got some cocaine, try to grind and stuff
Went to jail, now your time is up
Can’t get it all together cause your mind is fucked
Mad at the world cause you ride the bus
Looking out the window, wanna ride like us
I’ma tell you something that’s good for your health
Never give up on yourself
You never know when it’s your turn to get rich
Brand new whip with a bad lil bitch
Hunned thousand dollars on your first car

Moving round like that, beaver doing great
I remember I was state pen ache for great
I remember how the stake and that vva
Just touched back down so I’m extra straight
Got a date with an asian she be register bar
On half down town, wanna fuck my car
I’m a real rap star, got the felony flow
Like I robed the baseline and fucked the melody slow

Let me take em far back man
(Verse 1)
Reminiscin’ talkin’ about the times we missin’
Zeus overloads zap board clip clip
Bumpin’ Too Short E-40, gas break div
A zip and a 40, and some bad women
Remember the fresh fast, that was the best
We used to sit in the nose bleeds and smoke a spliff
Zip bag hell seeds, we were weed stressed
When the South used to fuck with the West
Coast doing the most
Candy apple paint star wise and vogues
Fast bank, penitentiary pose
Everybody eating, fly brand new clothes
This is a family affair, a family reunion
A special occasion, we barbeque’n
We had to bring this OG shit back
Battle cat on the track
(Hook)
Do you remember?
The games we played
I feel the same way
So come on over
And let me have my way
We took off
(Verse 2)
Poker sacks, Cadillacs on Saks
Car pass, smoke bounce
Have an ounce off that
Watchin’ that Cadillac off that
Candy drip up and down front back
On that floss that, lost in transition
Just reminiscin’
Of the days of the homie in the flippin pigeons
But we live for the moment and we love livin’
Do you remember, every September?
On the hoes bumper, Alpine’s bumpin’
System overload, gotta find something
To get in next summer
The ends kept coming
Smoking on tree, the bomb EP
Indica tai, we rollin on three
Tank you awake you
To make you feel how I feel my nigga
Can you relate to a dog pound?

Do you remember?
The games we played
I feel the same way
So come on over
And let me have my way
We took off

I’m waiting on the mother ship
On some Parliament, funkadelic shit
When I was ten, it wasn’t Too Short
And I was at the Colliseum
Watchin’ George Clinton
I see these grey hairs on my chin, but
I swear, I’m feeling young again
Cause back in ’76, I dreamed of being rich
But never like this
And now I’m beginning to see
All the memories are so clear to me
You just wanna make a better world for your kids
But it’s hard when you try telling your girl what it is
Then you think about your mama and all the drama
She still raised you
You still wanna buy a house for her somewhere safe and sound
Loving all this money we makin’ now

I just wanna be your Superwoman
Wanna keep you goin, wanna make you smile
I'm the one that's gon' be faithful to ya
Never doubt you, c'mon, let me show you how
Baby don't you know you drive me crazy
Got to have you baby, cause I love your style
Boy I'm never gonna let you go
Gotta let you know, you can stop right now

Through thick and thin, to the end
If I ran out of money, no dividends?
If I had to do time, if I was up in the pen
Would you still be my lady, would you still be my friend?
No matter how tough it get, no matter whatever matter
Are you gon' still have my back like a chiropractor?
Through sickness, through health, for better for worse
'Til the day that they haul me off in a hearse?
Our world is as big as we make it
Let's make the best of it darling, let's celebrate it
We too real to be phony, why should we fake it?
We too young to be lonely, let's elevate it
We can reach for the stars, the outer limits
Would you share with me if you had the winning lottery ticket?
I need the kind of broad that they don't make
The kind that know how to cook and communicate


I'm not a Rescue Ronnie, I'm a mack-a-roni
My mack game is impeccable, no baloney
But you done whipped it on a player so tough
So much it make a player wanna put his pimp cup up
I be hardheaded, superthug
You want me at home, but I be at the club
Gettin whiskey'd and perkin and gettin tilt
But at the club is where e'rybody be gettin killed
I'm a mannish person, superperkin
This is how I eat momma, see I be networkin
I stay in the traffic, I'm all about my G's
Put your clothes on darling, let's go to Tommy T's
The Comedy Club, up in the Contra {?}
Off of Willow Pass Road, up in Concord
I ain't a pretty boy, and I ain't ugly
If a broad got up in my face would you scratch her up for me?


Now I ain't never gonna let you go
No no, never never gonna let you go, nah-ha
I ain't never gonna let you go
Gotta let you know, we can stop right now

You remind me of my favorite instrument a guitar
Or my favorite vehicle, a Chevy SSR
I'm a turf superstar we go together like a drink and the bar
Like Tiger Woods and the back nine par, trust dat
I know you the type to stand tall through it all
Let's splurge a little, let's me and you hit the mall
I get you the Stella McCartney jeans and books
You get me the Steve Harvey line collection suit
We can juggle some bills and use our skills
We can sell a few pills and make a few deals
However whatever to get the scrill
Whatever it takes for us to get over the hill

Right right now

Rappers’ Ball [LP Version],UnKnown,UnKnown,"Where them naked hoes at?
E-Feezey!
Too Scheezy!
We off the heezy fo'scheezy baby!
Off the heezy I thought you theezy!!
Niggas ain't havin no cheesy like us main!
They ain't havin no raveez!
Shit
Haha you know us
Where K-Ceeezi at man? Tell him sing that shit
Lace dem fools or something
Beotch!
Chorus: K-Ci
Say that you got it all
Love the way you players ball
Everyday you're at the mall
Tell me is it true or false
Say that you got it all
Love the way you players ball
Claimin that your mail is tall
Tell me is it true or false
Verse One: E-40, Too $hort
I put my mack hand down ain't never been asound
I was havin be -are-e-a-d way before this rap game nigga been town
Thought you theezy, for sheezy, niggas 'member
Earl, Brat, and Denell dem boys from Vallel
At every light it's automatic, BURN RUBBER
See my folkers in the traffic, WHASSUP ERB
Follow that cab it got dope in it, uhh
My potnah $hort got hoes in it
I'm always hearin rappers big ballin on they songs
I do that shit for real and you'll never say I'm wrong
S-500 straight sittin on twenties
TV in the dash pimpin hoes gettin money
I'm Too $hort baby been down since the eighties
For the last eight years rode around in a Mercedes
Lexus, trucks, drop-Vette, Caddy
Bitches don't call me by my name they call me daddy
Chorus
Verse Two: E-40, Too $hort
K-Ci $hort E-40 Fonzarelli
I'll probably never have long money like Ross Perilli
But shit we just want a hip
Don't want the whole plate
Don't put the two on the ten, don't ever perpetrate
Like a lot of these fools I see on TV
With the Armani Chanel Versus Versacci
Why motherfuckers can't be broke sometimes?
Sometimes it's cool to floss
But don't buy an eighty-five thousand dollar car
Before you buy a house
They always said I couldn't rap, I just say bitch
I guess the bitch, made me rich
And now you wanna call me hardcore
While I be steppin out the shower on a marble floor
I paid the IRS taxes send FedEx and faxes
This industry'll is like fuckin, fat bitches
All work and no play, I do it everyday
Anyway 'cause I gotta stay paid 40
Chorus
Verse Three: E-40, Too $hort
We throw parties on big-ass boats, niggas wrap they paper
Ultrafied all-inclusive trips, Montego Jamaica
Front row seats at the Ultimate Fights, shamrock and severin
Long expensive fuh-flights, up dere in the heavens
Fat ass royalty checks, fat ass cribs
Smokin blunts and drinkin brew on the blacony, barbecuin ribs
The more scrilla, the merrier
I represent the Ya area
I walk from Foothill and Paperscourt to Sixty-Seven MacArthur
To Freddie be house to make tapes with my potnah
Hit Arroyo Park, we had tapes for sale
Got a paper bag full of that, can't you tell
It's funky, everybody nod they head like this
I said bitch, and everybody read my lips
I got rich, suckin up the game from the O
And even though a lot of rappers got the same kind of flow
I survived 'cause I got mo', game than them
It came straight from the prostitutes, players, and pimps
It was my destiny, I came the same every time
So don't question me, I transfer the game in the rhymes
I'm not a freestyler, don't rap for free main
It's Paystyle on mine, 'cause I love money main
Landrovers and Toyota, Lexuses
Six-hundred feet twelve with them big ass motor Mercedeses
We don't be savin hoes, bitches be savin us
Bitch disrespect me in my car, bitch best to catch the bus
I keep a briefcase full of game, while y'all be ear-hustlin
Ain't no paperback pimpin nigga, we ain't strugglin
Chorus
Verse Four: Too $hort
I'm Shorty the Pimp, I come funky
Again and again, they say when will it end?
Maybe never, cause I can still spit it
But I ain't rappin for cheese, I want meal tickets
Gotta start somewhere, and I'm past that
For the right scratch, I be the last mack
So stick yaself Pretty Tony
You tryin ta make a hit, but your shit sounds phony
Not like AT&T but like ET
You can't be me, so would you please see
If you can keep my name out your mouth
Cause you don't really know what the game's all about
It's bout feedin the family, not freakin in the Benz
Instead of rentin, pay for that roof on your head
And stop pimpin in your mind knowin you a trick
Put your hustle down playa go an hit you a lick
Bitch!
(That's writ, Too Scheezi, Ant Banks, Forty Fonzarelli, K-Ci)
Damn is that right?
(That's right)",https://genius.com/E-40-rappers-ball-lp-version-lyrics
