Switch Lanes,The Life and Times of Jonny Valiant,2013.0,"I pull that Crown up outta that purple bag
Polo boots with my shirt to match
Pimpin' im leanin' my seat further back
Hit the gas in my bird then smash up 85 North we turnin' heads
Star status
Arm tatted
Out the window dudes lookin' hard at us
Cause they girlfriend wanna jump in they don't wanna fuck me man these hoes got a car fetish
But lets roll (roll roll roll)
Hit the pedal and lets ride
So much smoke pourin' out the window lookin' like the leather's on fire

When I be drivin' in the car
Kicker in the back
Shotty in the front
Windows pitch black
Switch lanes (la la la)
Switch lanes (la la la)
When I be drivin' in the car
Session in the back
Hemi in the front so I ain’t worried bout' that
Switch lanes (la la la)
Switch lanes (la la la)

Speedin through GA like I’m ridin' in a General Lee
I re-revvin' up the engine when I'm in the street
My kickers beat you thought that a parade was coming
You probably thought that someone threw a grenade or something
You trynna' say you wasn't impressed please save it woman
Got you all up in the seat getting naked wantin' to make out
But you better not get no make-up on em'
These car jackers wanna follow me then take it from me
I got some heat up under my seat waitin on em
So why your face look funny homie you jealous of me
Cause I pull up on the scene so elegantly
Me and Mike P. together and we killin' the beat
We might of seen a little fame but we still in the street
From the the A all the way to the D
Throw the peace to the haters a hey when I see all the ladies come wavin' at me

When I be drivin' in the car
Kicker in the back
Shotty in the front
Windows pitch black
Switch lanes (la la la)
Switch lanes (la la la)
When I be drivin' in the car
Session in the back
Hemi in the front so I ain’t worried bout' that
Switch lanes (la la la)
Switch lanes (la la la)

I ain't goin' nowhere
I ain't goin' home
I just need that tick tick
Followed by that (boom)
And that could get me high
Can you feel me
See I been wonderin' why
The only time I'm still me is

When I be drivin' in the car
Kicker in the back
Shotty in the front
Windows pitch black
Switch lanes (la la la)
Switch lanes (la la la)
When I be drivin' in the car
Session in the back
Hemi in the front so I ain’t worried bout' that
Switch lanes (la la la)

In My Zone,Next To Nothing,2014.0,"I've got sunshine in my pocket, I'm just right here in my zone
I've got Sade in my tape deck, I'm just movin' right along
All these haters really love me, they just pretend that they don't
Cause I've got sunshine in my pocket, I'm just right here in my zone
In my zone

Zo-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
In my zone, zo-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
In my zone, zo-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
When I'm in my, when I'm in my
Zo-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh - in my zone

In my old school bumpin' that ""Kiss of Life"" beneath the city lights
Caught up in the moment, getting misty eyed
Bout to give my past life a long kiss goodnight
This dream difficult for me to visualize
And now it's real and they say the limit is the sky
But my feet set on solid ground, no more stalling now
On the road to get it cause, when it rained, it poured
But now the storms finally calming down
Up in my cutlass driving, the sun is shining
My Strange piece studded with a ton of diamonds
I ain't got a bunch of money on a constant grind
Still it beats being blunted with my stomach growlin'
In the darkest alley, got the heart to fight
I see the stars are bright, they screaming Jonny Valiant
Rappers wanna bite me, they crocodiling
I be up in Neiman Marcus smiling
Try to walk a mile inside my J's, playing make believe
You can say that you played in the major league
Wear my heart on my sleeve on the stage and leave
I feel wet from the sweat on my Famous tee
I'm never scared, fuck shaking like a maple leaf
Cause what awaits for me is unknown
So I lit up my J, filled my cid-up with straight
Crown Royal, now I'm in my zone

I've got sunshine in my pocket, I'm just right here in my zone
I've got Sade in my tape deck, I'm just movin' right along
All these haters really love me, they just pretend that they don't
Cause I've got sunshine in my pocket, I'm just right here in my zone
In my zone

This ain't no ordinary love
I was sick of being poor and said ""enough""
Right up 85 North and there I was
Working, breaking down doors and barriers
Still representing Georgia, I'm feeling the support
Spread the word cause the more, the merrier
Nobody blowing out the torch I carry
I ignore them every time they point and stare and judge
All because I got Jordans on, I got a gorgeous blonde
And my jewelry blinds, I got stupid style
Getting' paid doing music now, I'm putting' huge amounts
Inside a few accounts, I got a crew that's down
In case you wanna come and duke it out
If I was you, I'd throw the deuce and bounce
And we just blew an ounce
My hotel room looking like a hookah lounge
I'm blowing up like a bazooka round
I got booed and bowed but stayed positive
Even when I didn't have a pot to piss in
I was sitting on a bottle steady plotting this
And I'll be fine dining at The Optimist
I got the black sea bass and the lobster bisque
And took a shot of whiskey to the dome
Made a toast to the homies that are gone
Two for the fans and the love they shown, I'm in my... zone

I've got sunshine in my pocket, I'm just right here in my zone
I've got Sade in my tape deck, I'm just movin' right along
All these haters really love me, they just pretend that they don't
Cause I've got sunshine in my pocket, I'm just right here in my zone
In my zone

My calendar at this caliber's for the life of a bachelor
I'm burning through cannabis canister after canister
Um, so many cameras, they flashing, I never glance at 'em
Lost inside of a landfill of thoughts while watching this dancer
I'm wondering to myself if she's got some booty enhancer
Either way, I feel the deep inclination of putting my hands on her
I'm a modern day Galileo who lives in Atlanta
The capital of the ratchets, aristocrats and traffickers
A practitioner, practice until I master it
Passionate 'bout my adjectives, syllables so elaborate
Anything less to describe me is just inaccurate
You're a student of classes in which I am a graduate
Immaculate vernacular, Batmobile look like Dracula
Giving these boys the blues while telling these hoes to saddle up
You catching feelings, I think you squarer than Madison, I'm-
I'm in my zone, ain't no way I'll ever snap out of it

I've got sunshine in my pocket, I'm just right here in my zone
I've got Sade in my tape deck, I'm just movin' right along
All these haters really love me, they just pretend that they don't
Cause I've got sunshine in my pocket, I'm just right here in my zone

Sleep At Night,White Jesus,2012.0,"My girlfirend always number one on my side
But lately all we ever do is argue and fight
She said she can't imagine her becoming a wife
Marrying a rapper's no longer what she wants in her life
I told her I would go and get my GED
Even got a 9 to 5 flippin' burgers and fries
Tryna show her I'm dedicated and never want to separate
From her 'cause all I want is me and her to survive
We ain't ain't even makin' love anymore, and I'm sure it's a phase
But she just lays there and reads in bed
And me feet is tired from work instead of tryna flirt
I would rather go and smoke some weed instead
Been a month now ever since the day she left
Looked at the bedroom dresser and saw the note
Said she loved me but she needed a break, I guess
I'll leave it to fate but I'm praying that ain't all she wrote
I wonder how...

How do you go to sleep at night (Sleep at Night)
If I'm not the one sleeping with you (With you)
Bitch didn't I treat you right yeah that's how the story goes (Hey)
Wasn't I always there for you (There for you)
Now you just another song for me to write (Me to write)
A lullaby, so let me sharpen up my number 2 (Number 2)
So how do you go to sleep at night, bitch
If I'm not the one sleeping with you

You said that we were taking a break
How the fuck is that breaking up for good
On your Facebook page I see your status is 'single'
You had some pictures of me an you in your photo album
And all I see is shit wit' you hanging out with the same dude
Posin' with your camera phone
What the fuck that motherfucker got sandals on?
Are you kidding me?
I been drinking constantly, drowing in my misery
And you been out fucking somebody else, not even missing me?
What about all the history that we had with each other?
Everything is damaged, way too bad to recover
Somebody else has had his dick in you, stickin' you
Little despicable bitch and there's no way we can get back with each other
BItch! I always figured that our love would be timeless
Think about when we stayed with the fam in Orlando
Drunk as shit in the mountains, renting the honeymoon cabin
Never happen, gotta put it behind us, shit
Well I hope it's what you wanted you lying bitch
Hope his dick is bigger than mine is
Hope you finally got somebody who got an education
Not wasting his time rapping, following his dreams like I did
I wish that you and him would get in a car wreck or maybe catch a STD
But I should be happy for you to fly away and just be free
But the memory won't let me be
I'm still wondering how...

How do you go to sleep at night (Sleep at Night)
If I'm not the one sleeping with you (With you)
Bitch didn't I treat you right yeah that's how the story goes (Hey)
Wasn't I always there for you (There for you)
Now you just another song for me to write (Me to write)
A lullaby, so let me sharpen up my number 2 (Number 2)

For Real,The Life and Times of Jonny Valiant,2013.0,"So you know I’m bout to K.I.L.L
People say I’m crazy maybe so I need to go and take a P.I.L.L
They should lock me up and throw away the key and put me in a C.E.L.L
They say they don't like the way I’m spitting fuck 'em they can go to H.E.L.L
For R.E.A.L. LET’S GO

Don’t play me man it’s kill or be killed
Fuck with me now blood is getting spilled on the field
I'm going crazy no refill on my pills
Ain't no use in anybody trying to tell me to chill, or cool off, cause the screws off
In my head ain’t tight they loose ya’ll better try ta get a move on, get a u-haul, dog, a Ryder truck
Before I slice you up and put your body in the boondocks
I was doing it when Busta was saying Woo Ha!
When Boyz II Men was the shit and was singing Doo-Wop
We was sticking two Phillies together calling 'em ooh-wops what you mad nobody knew who you was
Man, a brew buzz, wasn’t never enough
We crushed anything we knew that we could toot up
Our nostril, we pop pills and do bumps
Falling out the sky like parachuters
Who wants drama wanna come and rumble with the champ
Better not be on no weak shit
Cause when it comes to rap I got it locked like it’s a prison camp, these little kids can scram
Or tell 'em bow down kiss the hand
When they get put in their place at first they wouldn’t embrace me now their faced with admitting that I got what it takes
And I’m a stay killing records tell 'em murders the case, until the day they consider me as one of the greats, I’m bout to…

K.I.L.L. people say I’m crazy maybe so I need to go and take a P.I.L.L

For R.E.A.L. LET’S GO

Here I come tell 'em bombs away
And when I say that I’m coming that means I’m probably cumming on your baby mamas face
This shit’s easy I put on some Drake
We drank yellow tail Chardonnay and that was all it takes
I’m taking over so wake up and smell the coffee cakes
These other guys are fake they talk a lot but wouldn’t squash a grape
Don’t discombobulate them with me we are not the same, get out my lane, put on your breaks, and taste the marmalade
The fact I’m winning got you jelly
Your hype is dying down now your record isn’t selling
Your pride got you too competitive and scared of failing
You chilling in the club and they like Rittz is in the building
And it’s killing you, any who
I be in a kiddie pool with liquor and some hoes these other rapper’s are miniscule
Anybody that’s coming at me can get it too, take it too far and end up kissing my tennis shoe
Now let me see your titties boo, cause all I see is pics of your kids on the internet
No body wanna see them, we can be friends
We can pretend that it’s cheese dip on your face when we know it’s really semen
Let your knees bend and show the homies the bulls eye
Move ya booty like you was trying to hula hoop
My God, now suck it like you was bout to use a Hoover vacuum
That dude is stupid in the booth I

K.I.L.L. people say I’m crazy maybe so I need to go and take a P.I.L.L

For R.E.A.L. LET’S GO

We drinking like Hank Williams and smoking like Willie Nelson, you betta try to hire Van Helsing
Or a monster killa homie cause no one can help them
Jealous of me cause I make the shit that nobody else can
I’m the long haired red-headed rapper that be showing out
On every single record other rappers bout to blow em out
The water it’s a slaughter why you talking shit you motor mouth
These motherfuckers adding up to no amount they know I’m bout to

K.I.L.L. people say I’m crazy maybe so I need to go and take a P.I.L.L

Bounce,Next To Nothing,2014.0,"Superstar, man I'm far from an average Joe, supernatural
Stepping out, looking like I'm in a fashion show
Came into this industry and now you're witnessing me blow up
Like seeing a tank of gas explode
And I'm, I'm high like I'm flyin sitting back of coach
By the window sipping Jack and Cokes
'Bout to pack a bowl but we ain't tryna bake a casserole
Looking at the globe from up high, shots fired
Like Kennedy was riding by the Grassy Knoll
I ain't rich but I got a little cash to blow
When haters saying that I'm changing
I'll be looking at them laughing like they cracked a joke
They wasn't with me when I traveled down this gravel road
GC, I could never have my pass revoked
So step up and you a dead duck
Get your head bust, looking like a chef just cracked a yolk
Speakers in the Caddy rattling the patio
When the industry was only rocking platinum gold
I was dope back then, but you had the whole
Shit locked until I came and I cracked the code
And I don't, I don't really mean to brag and boast
But then again, my fans look at me as the G.O.A.T
She said she listen to my music in the bath and soak
Now that's a rap to quote, hop in my 'Lac and float
A Ya Uh Yeah

Take a puff and it's up and away we go
Put some pimp shit on my radio and bounce, bounce, out
Let the bass vibrate my chest, take it to the Midwest
Brought it back to the south, and bounce, out

With my homie Tony footwork
Up in Kalamazoo, balling out up in the mall
We don't bounce 'til we spend a couple thousand on shoes
I'm repping clintel, how can I lose, you out of the loop
These music dudes were clueless who I was
'Til I blew, producing woohs and oohs and ahs
I'm the truth, what you confused? Are you surprised?
I refuse to lose, been booed and crucified
Disapprove the movement, crews get brutalized
If  these pooches choose to bite, get euthanized
I'm the new, the who is who gets neutralized
Twenty two's are huge, my shoes are supersized
Out on cruse, my music boomin' stupid loud
Bumping 8 Ball & MJG, from the outside looking in
I'm sitting on top of the world, but then again I kind of been lately
When I pull up in my Cadillac, my speakers got that rattle back
I'm flashin' back to when I was attacked by
A couple pretty bitches that was begging me to pick em up
And take em in and fuck em from the back side
But I ain't got no time to fuck around, I'm trying to buckle down
And focus on my money, so I stack my
Paper to the ceiling, I'm feeling like a billion
I'm filling up my cup with that crown and bounce out


Smoking wood, then I’m gone
So far that you can’t even see me through the eyes of a telescope
Diamonds on my body, so appealin  jottin' down my feelins'
Acting like it was the realest shit I ever wrote
Mental telepathy is part of the recipe
That let me know that you want it
I'm giving it to you how you like it
Biology of a pimp, it be in the DNA
To know what you thinking
I’m speaking to you like a psychic
Lil mama know she lovin it so don’t try to fight it
I can make your life so appealing by the way I write it
Make it so she the only shawty I know
On Forgiatos, don’t hit no potholes
I roll up one and light it
On the passenger side of a ride
Like a player, Imma be up in the club talking the  big shit
Strange Music, we be the misfits
Come and twist Rittz, tisk tisk, cause you gon get your shit split
Middle of the map and nigga finna snap
And let em know the area continue to kill em forever, we on
Better be strong to live in the city I come from
And if you ain’t fucking with it then let it be known
And we can either talk about it or be about it
Me I’d rather sit back and blow an ounce
When I hear something like this up on the radio
All a nigga can do is just bounce",https://genius.com/Rittz-bounce-lyrics
Like I Am,The Life and Times of Jonny Valiant,2013.0,"(Verse 1)
Fuck the rookie of the year bitch I'm a future hall of famer
You can see I came up
Long time coming from a dude who never gave up
You know another rapper comin' hard as me then name one
Talk a lot of shit about me, I don't entertain 'em
Bang 'em, fuck hoes, used to ball and chain 'em
The groupie at the show that blew me, you would probably claim her
Put the pimpin' on the bitch, you suckers oughta tame her
Blame me 'cause I turned her out she used to be an angel
Stranger, but canned a Strange Music new addition
Fans told me to kill it I'mma do what you insisted
Real shit don't gotta separate the true from fiction
Famous tee and Levi's, we ain't got the True Religion
Coming out the super system on some slum shit
Unfit for your kids to listen to a dumbie with a young bitch
Eating mushrooms on a two day long trip
Dissolving Molly capsules on a Sunkist
Come sip on meth, on coke
Crush it with the credit card
Or the room key used to get inside the Travelodge
Camouflage Jeremy Scotts in the Chevy Avalanche
Fantasize about the life of it 'cause I'm an enterprise
Fuck a bitch and when I finish, tell the bitch ""no más"" Adiós!  and I know you wanna party ho
But I got a lot of dough I'm trying to get
I'm runnin' circles round these rappers tell 'em catch up on they cardio
About to blow damn right, steppin' on a land mine
We can throw them hands I'm never scared of combat
Representing in a A-Town skullcap
I ain't from the country bitch, motherfuck a straw hat
We ain't ridin' skateboards, we be rocking all black
Thinking that it's all good, find out that it's all bad
Stick you up and run off with the shit y'all have
Nerve of these guys, we ain't giving y'all dap
(Hook)
Please you ain't like us
We ain't like them
And if you listen close enough than you can be like I am
You can be like I am , you can be like I am
Shit you ain't like us
We ain't like them
And if you listen close enough than you can be like I am
You can be like I am , you can be like I am
You can be
You can be like I am
You can be like I am
You can be like I am
You can be like I am
(Verse 2)
See y'all be on some trash shit, I be tryin' to smell good
Burberry Brit, bitch sniffin' and I smell blood
I be like a predator, the only thing I fear is God
Still y'all judging me because of my appearance
You got a lot of nerve, 'cause everything I hear sucks
Even if I was to use a pair of ear plugs
Rappers looking like some lying lames trying to me trying hard
Posing like they taking pictures for the yearbook
Rowdy like a white kid who got a beer buzz
We ain’t on no Miller, no Michelob
Only brown liquor straight and mixed with Coke
Put us in the four bitch, no Motel 6, Hotel Indigo
Me and you are the opposite of identical
You just cocky, I'm confident, I'm an animal
And I plan to go far with this rap shit
You the type of dude to do the quit and give up on 'em like D'Angelo
Cameltoe pussy boy, gangsta on the internet
That's why I don't respond to people coming incorrect
This world small, fuck a gun, 'cause a punch in the mouth
Will put a stop on people trippin' on this Twitter shit
I ain't even trippin', no, with a hoe eating raw
Oysters on a half shell dripping in a mayonette
On a Saltine double, I was called seeing shit
Now walk inside the booth and I be spinning heads fire injury
Red leather coat, coat, trend setter, flow, flow
Feelin' good because I got a couple grand to blow, blow
No hope, pull the horses on a go-go
They try to keep me out the gimmick that's a no-go
Pogo stick bitches still jump a dick
'Cause my buzz getting bigger by the tickin' of the second hand
Make your wife try to hide her wedding band
Make your life pathetic man, dammit that'll never stand
(Hook)
Shit you ain't like us
We ain't like them
And if you listen close enough than you can be like I am
You can be like I am , you can be like I am
Shit you ain't like us
We ain't like them
And if you listen close enough than you can be like I am
You can be like I am , you can be like I am
You can be
You can be like I am

I’m game, they think I'm playin' but I ain't
Why lames act hard, they far from it
Killing you ain't nothin' but a walk in the park for me
Shove you in the middle of the street when a car coming

Blood leakin' like a virgin pussy at homecoming
Dissing me is similar to theivin' some dough from me
Get beat like a promoter tryna cheat me on show money
Backstage doing blow with a snow bunny
Rappers that you thinks dope, we poke fun at
But don’t come at me wrong, homie you don’t want it
These coyote dudes too slow for this roadrunner
.357 throatfucking you, choke on it

You can't ignore any normal day
Niggas is horrible, course I’m forced to say

Step in the circle of course you're gonna pay a toll
Gonna be working to put the body in a knoll
Sucker, you never gonna get the weapon to fold the soldier

Evil up in the brain make a Bane persona
Mentally in pain when I rain the Llama
On any fucking lame who wanna bring the drama
Pickin' the punk and I push him to pay
Pop a pilly 'pon his pimples and pray
Peep at you passive for penalty play
Pitches, pasta, pregnant pussy penne

White Rapper,Next To Nothing,2014.0,"White boy 

Nine deuce was the year my ears got introduced to rap
Stealing instrumentals off singles, I’d use the tracks
MC Pooh, Mellow Man, and Jeru the Damaja
""Tears"" from the King  and I, was the few I had
Practiced in my room for hours, improved my craft
Bought every artist's album that I heard
On the song, ""Bring It On"", number fourteen
Till death do us part
Wishing that I was from the 5th ward of Houston bad
A white kid from the burbs, bumping 5th Ward boys
Too much trouble and Seag that Odd Squad Cassette
Up in class rapping bum stiggity bum, giggity gangsta gangsta
Biting Spice 1 and Das EFX
Kriss Kross and Method, Redman in my headphones
Blasting ""Time Time 4 Sum Aksion""
That’s when then the teacher would get mad
And she would kick me out the classroom
The bell rang, start a cypher in the bathroom
Up inside the gym, take turns spitting
And beat the bleachers with our hands, tryin to keep the beat
Only white dude that went to my school that spit
Proved I’m sick, and I will eat MCs
I had room to grow, the talent show, I rocked the vest like Treach
Miami Hurricane hat while I held the mic
Haters talking shit like who, this fake Vanilla Ice
And I don’t care if he’s nice, on my life
I don’t like no white rappers

Growing up it was tough, my family said that I suck
They gave up, I was just a white rapper
But I created a buzz, cause I bust
In the booth, I go nuts, but I’m just a white rapper
Put in work to be dope, and I know that you think I’m a joke
Cause I’m just a white rapper
Put my heart on the stage, on the page
But at the end of the day, I’m still just a white rapper

In ninth grade, I kept getting better, by tenth
I was convinced I’d get a deal
My skills improved a hundred percent
Back then, nobody had studio equipment in their crib
I was the only one that did
I spent my life in that basement
On Cruse Road, up in Eagle Pointe
Cops labeled it a gang house, we was doing music
We dropped out, dreaming of being on
18 and 31, I would go out and perform
Open mics, where no one’s white
No one likes to clap or give you dap
Clubs you be scared to go inside
Stood at a spot in the hood, 20 miles from home
Waiting to finally hit the stage and blow their mind
Perform for 5 people, or 20 at best
Sending demo tapes to labels, a ton of rejects
A ton of fake record company execs saw my talent
And tried their best to convince me they had some to invest
And just wasting my time, phony managers scamming us
Girlfriend and family, the verdict unanimous
To ""Stop rapping you piece of shit, it’s not happening
Now act white and grow up, are you trying to embarrass us?""
So I told that girl bye no one's stoppin stride
Rhymes kept getting better, my buzz was hard to deny
Almost quit and when I did got introduced to the guy
That put me on, and he'd been through the same struggle as I
A white rapper


Now the rap game is flooded with rappers
From every nationality, a ton of them crackers
The fact that I finally came up is miraculous
Twenty years later my name is becomin' established
My album is on the rack at Best Buy
I was at the BET awards, I was sitting right next ta
Luda and Rick Ross, but who woulda thought
I was just at Jim & Nick's, flipping chicken tenders and French fries
I used to hate when people asked me what I do for a living
It feels great to tell em you’re a musician
Until they ask what type of music, I tell 'em I rap
Then they laugh, looking at me, they be like ""who are you kidding?""
I be like ""Google me bitch,""
They always compare us white boys to one another
""Is your music like his?""
""You should be rich,"" ""Freestyle,"" making stupid requests
Before I made it in music I never used to have shit
Now I got my own crib, I can afford my car
Fans say my music helps them when they’re goin' through hard times
I speak my mind even when I’m goin' too far
Even though a part of me agrees with Lord Jamar
We are guests in hip hop, I’m appreciative
That you finally let us in the crib
But I busted my ass to get respect for my craft
In interviews they never forget to mention this
That I’m just a white rapper",https://genius.com/Rittz-white-rapper-lyrics
I’m Only Human,Last Call,2017.0,"I'm only human
It's hard to count all of my mistakes I've made
I'm only human
Don't have the power to save the day, I can't
I'm only human
Nobody's perfect, I've been ashamed of things I've done
I need improvement, I need to work it
So many things for change to come
I'm only human

We all breathe the same air, share the same living space
Breath the same from the day that we came up out our mom's womb
Character traits from our parents, we behave how we've been taught to
Identify by a country, and a state, and a race, and a faith we belong to
From our face, what we're  labeled and named we respond to
All too innocent until we get imprinted from the images we witness
And eventually resemble what we gone through
Some people say the shape of your fate is beyond you
Other say that fate is what you make it
I try to do right 'cause they glue you up to state when they see you make a wrong move
But I ain't superhuman, I don't got a cape or a costume
Homie on the dog food, thought he got clean
Talkin' to him, all he doin' is nodding out sleep
Who am I to judge him? Hard for me to drink and not fiend
Scared they gon' find my dead body on the box-spring
Know a lot of cool chicks, some with daddy issues
Hard to tell how many men have been up in her mouth piece
Men fuck a ton of women, they a certified pimp
When the shoe was on the other foot, they holler out freak
Like she isn't wife material
Both got venereal diseases, burnin' while they piss
Friends in long-term relationships, lying to each other
Never told them about the dirt they went and did
Kids acting out, searching for a dad
Young adults feel at fault to their parents 'cause they want a college grad
I can background check you, do research about your past
But I never know that person in the flesh 'cause

I'm only human
It's hard to count all of my mistakes I've made
I'm only human
Don't have the power to save the day, I can't
I'm only human
Nobody's perfect, I've been ashamed of things I've done
I need improvement, I need to work it
So many things for change to come
I'm only human

Like the girl on Instagram tryna show her body off to get more likes
Had a dude who got in trouble 'cause his girl saw him hit the heart sign
Waking up, embarrassed, my manager pissed at me 'cause I was drunk on live
Last night on my phone doing blow like it's cool when I know it ruins lives
Several times it almost ruined mine, what a waste
Wanna lie like I'm doin' fine, but I ain't
Wanna quit before it's too late, pump the brakes
Insecure, I wanna lose weight, but I can't 'cause I drink socially
The only way that I can function
Dissing people in the public based off an assumption
When I should have called and had a one-on-one discussion
Disgusted, I'm cussing out someone I trusted
Guilty and the glove fit
Stuck in a rut, hit ignore the minute that my friends called
Last Christmas I was dissed, feeling pissed and I went off
Fuck I wish I didn't involve my in-laws
Fist's all swollen, giant hole inside a thin wall in my living room
And ever since it's been a pitfall
Really need my family, I don't never call them ask them how they kids are, tell them I miss y'all
Can't ignore the insults, thought I had a thick skin, you could just unfollow me, don't gotta leave the ten cents
Caught up in this business and I don't really fit in
Call on my prescription to calm me down like Prince did
I don't got a spotter when I bench press all the pressure on my chest
Lost another friendship hopin' they forgive me, I forgive them
This wasn't my intention

I'm only human
It's hard to count all of my mistakes I've made
I'm only human
Don't have the power to save the day, I can't
I'm only human
Nobody's perfect, I've been ashamed of things I've done
I need improvement, I need to work it
So many things for change to come
I'm only human",https://genius.com/Rittz-im-only-human-lyrics

Slumerican Shit, yeah

It's Rittz, Jonny Valiant
Bitch bonjour carry on board
I've been deadly on the mic since back in '04
Mother fuckers say I disrespect the art form
You don't wanna piss me off 'cause I'm a ticking time bomb
I'm from G.C., everybody hardcore
When they hear that gun clap like an encore
Leave the car door looking like a dart board
More holes in your body than a golf course
Fuck that I'mma stand tall, never fall short
Heard someone say I got the ball in my court
My boys,  and my gutter homies I'mma die for
I’m not a human I’m more like a cyborg
I soar on the highway 85 north
Mingling on Singleton on down to Five Forks
I'm sure you ain't heard of me
But now it's time for
People looking in the sky like why Lord, it's white...

It's White Jesus
Don't trip 'cause this ain't blasphemy
Actually that's my nickname
Rittz in this bitch and the beat's from Plymp mane
And can't nobody fuck with the pen game, my name is white...

Don't trip 'cause this ain't blasphemy
Actually that's my nickname

And can't nobody fuck with the pen game, my name is Rittz, bitch

I'mma as naughty as a redneck
A product of dope rhymes
My punchline'll punish 'em
Man I'm coming like Big Pun in the 90's
I'm a son of a gun; we don't want diplomacy
Rapping like fuck 'em if they ain't feeling where I'm coming from
'Cause everybody bubblegum
We ain't even listenin' to 'em, we making fun of 'em
And say it right in front of 'em
Ain't no comparison, fucker we're Slumerican
And everything been looking lovely, the way the cake is crumbling
I've been observin' local rappers and it's troublin'
They bite so much, it's like someone needs to muzzle them
Some people's ego be so big they need some humblin'
They wishing I would disappear but here I come again
It's like I finally got the ball run around fumblin'
Still crumblin' herb, drunken and slurred, mumblin' words
I must've emerged from nothing to something
All of a sudden everyone say they love me
And they call me white...

And can't nobody fuck with the pen game, my name is Rittz, bitch

It's been a long dark road and nobody acknowldege me
Feelin' my homie, kickin' me when I finally hit bottom
When I was fallin' they was laughin' at me, watching me toppling
I was callin', everbody walking on me and stoppin' me
But they thought I was finished, they was sure I was done
Swung back as the rapper that I was gonna become
In the industry, noticing the majority's young
Cocky motherfuckers acting so important they just won
And my fam got me feelin' I'm the normalest one
'Cause everybody using words like ""vibe"", ""sonic"", and ""viral""
All I can say is fuck, goddamn it, it's my go
My lyrics paint a picture like a Pablo Picasso
I know that can't nobody fuck with the squad
Yelawolf, Shawty Fatt, Young Struggle and Watts
Don't let the long hair fool you, I don't play the guitar
I'm a rapstar, this'll how the song'd go on, White Jesus

It's White Jesus
Don't trip 'cause this ain't blasphemy

I wanna talk to you tonight about stepping into your divine destiny
Everyone of us has seeds of greatness on the inside
You have a gift to share with this world
There is buried treasure down in you right now
Potential that has not been yet released
Yet so often we let other people talk us out of our dreams
We let disappointments and failures keep our treasure buried
We allow insecurities and low self esteem to convince us that
We don’t have anything special to offer
There is treasure on your inside
You have something to offer that no one else has
And if you don’t step into your destiny and release your gift
Then this world will not be as bright as it should be",https://genius.com/Rittz-white-jesus-lyrics
Fuck Swag,The Life and Times of Jonny Valiant,2013.0,"Fuck swag (4x), Swag

15's in the back of the Dodge
Out the garage
And my homies riding with me and they better recharge
I talk about the clientele and tell 'em they won't be off
I'm off Atlanta representers and we're given the yonk
And be better this cars and the swap in the squad
They think they swagging but they lame as fuck we laugh at these boys
Uncontrollably like we just hit the gravity bong
Half of these rappers too wack to be even rapping and all
Trying to dress up like a wierdo hoping that somebody notice 'em
Make me wanna strike and knock em down like they a bowling pin
Maybe I’m just old and out of touch, attitude is fuck it
Cause If you don't like me go and watch some Nickelodeon, you lil motherfucker
I'm over and I stick 'em up they say they're YOLO go and then provoking
And it's hard time for me to tell the difference between a rapper and a singer
Of a rock and roll band I don't think that shit is appropriate
Way too many rappers wanna look like Lenny Kravitz
Personally I think these pussies get too many passes
Thrift store shopping with the shit your rocking
Looks lame and your music ain't neat the shit is average
And if that will make you matters even better
I don't sweat on people talking shit about the way I look every day
Long hair don't care, red pair of Air Jordans
And I wear all black, no hook

Fuck swag (x10)

All these rappers wanna bite like they don't know how to write
They constantly freestyle and think it's tight
Every time they say a line with a metaphor in it
They wanna pause or laugh or ad-lib
Fake swag they just copy who they like
Trying to sound like Gucci or Future or Tunechi
These dudes need a lesson before they get behind the mic
Ain't nobody buying your records they buying into hype
They was feeling me until they see I'm white
Now they like ""man he raps too fast""
What you slow homie? You handicapped?
What you need a walker, a hearing aid, or a fanny pack
What you unhappy the champ is back
The Manny Pac of the rap game that can't relax
I'm bout to raise the bar and they can't adapt, the cameras flash
Cause they see a star when I walk in the room
North side, Atlanta rap, I bet you wanna walk in my shoes
It's funny that I'm hot
Last year I was just cool when you
You was too official
Where the shoe that fits you
Tied yo' dick in skinny jeans, take your Louis belt and whip you
The clientele strip you of your jewellery, would take a pic
Post the shit on Instagram now suck a dick
You bitch, be looking real dumb
Still slum, I don't pleasant hear 'em
Bumping Big K.R.I.T. and Yelawolf I don't feel punk
Rappers with no skills come on witness me I kill them
You fucking with me I'm the real one

Misery Loves Company,The Life and Times of Jonny Valiant,2013.0,"Yeah
Fuck my life, that's how I feel when I wake up
I don't see no light inside this tunnel of mine
My girl just left, I guess that we're gonna break up
I just suppose she fucking around with some other guy
My homies wanna go and kick it, maybe some other time
I'm dead broke and gotta work another double today
My car broke down and tow truck on the way
My boss don't really give a fuck, he wrote me up cause I'm late
He gon' fuck around, and end up gettin' punched in the face
But I gotta control my temper cause I wanna get paid
Fuck this restaurant, I wanna set it ablaze, and take my own life
I’d do it if I wasn't afraid, that I would live
So fuck slittin' my wrists, cause if
I was dumb enough to commit, I would use a gun
Gloomy getting drunk in my room for months
I know my parents are embarrassed of their loser son
What if I would have done my homework like my sister did?
I would've graduated college like my brother did
And got a house the size of my little cousin's crib
But I complain and blamed it on the drugs I did
And now my pockets always empty as my stomach is
Sloppy drunk again, beginning to punch and kick
A bunch of holes in the wall
Took another trip into the dark side
Anybody comin' with? I said

Life just ain't that fun to me
Everything around me is crumbling
If you feel the same, then come with me
Cause misery loves company
I said, everybody seems so bubbly
Does anybody feel as bummed as me?
If you do then come with me
Cause misery loves company
Misery loves company, misery loves company
Misery loves company, misery loves company

Fuck these Newports, cause I can't afford them
I'm sick and tired of all my homies wantin' to bum one
It's funny that I use the word bum
Cause if I don't come up soon rapping, I'mma probably become one
I feel like people talk behind my back where I come from
If they supported me I'd be a wrap like a wonton
But every time I stumble upon some critic they call me fat and ugly
Why the fuck I let some dumb kid on the Internet piss me off this much?
I just did discussed it like I lost my touch
They don't realize how many lives are at stake
My fate rides on this, give me some props for once
But when they see me, they gon' wish I had on boxing gloves
Cussing at everybody like I'm some obnoxious drunk
Aimin' the shotguns at 'em like Shawty Fatt, in the “Pop the Trunk” video
Here we go, he lost it, run
The sunshine is gone, can't find no way in the dark
Layin' in the bed, I wake up prayin' to God
Please show me a better way to make it, I'm lost
I thought I found it in my lady but she breakin' my heart
Just entertaining the thought that she is gone for good
It's hard to put on a happy face and just forget
So I pop me a pill, take another trip into the dark side
Anybody comin' with? I said

Life just ain't that fun to me
Everything around me is crumbling
If you feel the same, then come with me
Cause misery loves company
I said, everybody seems so bubbly
Does anybody feel as bummed as me?
If you do then come with me
Cause misery loves company
Misery loves company, misery loves company
Misery loves company, misery loves company

Dear Lord, is it really all in my head?
Lately I've been thinking I'd be better off dead
I tell my girlfriend, she think I'm playin' I bet
One day she gonna find me dead in our bed
How pathetic I let all this little shit bother me
And I don't mean to be a baby, but I bottle it inside of me
Until I kinda think that I am suicidal and society
Will be a little better minus me
And I don't think that anyone will really miss me when I'm gone
My lady, she can go and suck as many dicks she want
My family photos will be normal now without me in ‘em
And my friends won't have to talk behind my back and try to front
Like they want me to make it when I know they really don't
They just wanna see me broke unless I can take 'em with
So they can get a free ride, I'm trying to make a grip
Off the sweat and the tears that I put in trying to rap
I just signed a record deal why the fuck am I so pissed?
Maybe I'm just scared I'mma fail and I'm stale
That these industry people don't wanna give me no props
Cause on a scale from 1 to 10 I'm a 12
By myself in a room with a bottle getting drunk as shit
Unhealthy, my livers is acting up again
But fuck that, I'mma chug and take another trip into the dark side
Anybody coming with?

Life just ain't that fun to me
Everything around me is crumbling
If you feel the same, then come with me
Cause misery loves company
I said, everybody seems so bubbly
Does anybody feel as bummed as me?
If you do then come with me
Cause misery loves company
Misery loves company, misery loves company
Misery loves company, misery loves company",https://genius.com/Rittz-misery-loves-company-lyrics

Gotta work a double when I finish I'mma stink
And my feet keep throbbin
I wish that I could rest
Wish I woulda finished school I never shoulda quit
Wish I didn't blame it on my parents
Disappearance of my father traumatizin' wish he never woulda left
That excuse is getting old
So is doing drugs
Reefer got me paranoid, so is doing bumps
But I still got a dollar bill to my nose snorting clear off a mirror
Man I wish I had a gun
But once again I bluff cause I really wanna live
I just wanna hug and a kid from my girl but she left
And my bed feels empty when I'm in it
Ain’t a minute passin by that I dont wonder where she is
More than a couple of my friends done drifted
Far from each other homie I just wish that
We could travel back in time and just re-live it;For a minute
When did we become so distant
Its been sunny outside and I'm high and wishin it'd rain
When I'm visitn memory lane and I'm wishin this Whiskey will whisk me away in the daylight

Wishin while I'm walkin on this lonely road
And I'm wishin you were by my side

Miss you when I'm gone, Gotta hit the road
I be gettin throwed every city is a blur
I kill it on the stage, takin pictures with these girls afterwards
But I really just be wishin they was her
And I wishin she'd believe me
Wish I didn't read the, negative comments that everybody wanna leave
Underneath the songs that I put up on the internet
I'm finna let it bother me, a part of me just wishes they would leave me alone
My journey wasn't easy to get here, I wish that they could see how far I came
I wish I had a street team, G's for some T-shirts and CD's
I barley got a dollar to my name
People thinkin that I'm on
My inbox fillin up with features and I wish I could respond
My phone keep ringin, friends sayin that I'm changin
When I finally get a minute to myself all alone I be drunk
My alarm goin off in the mornin, I been snortin all night
I wish that I could hit snooze
Got a song I'm about to leak, I wish that I was enthused
But apparently I gotta diss dudes to get views
Sick of sittin on the back burner with a lit fuse
They sayin it ain't my turn yet
I'm sick of these music industry
Motherfuckers bullshitin
When the truth is ain't no rapper fuckin with me
Feelin like Im gettin used
Thats another excuse
I wish that I was them
I wish I had a tour bus
The car that I be in
Ain't got no air condition and I'm wishin there was wind
I can't afford a shirt I gotta wear this one again
Man I wish someone would send a box of some free shit
I'm wishin I had a bigger buzz
I've been tryin so hard to make it happen with the rap
But for now I make it happen with the drugs

Paved the way for Gwinnett County, bitch you know I’m Slum
You can listen to my first album
And see where some of these double time rappers got their whole style from
Nobody talking shit about me cause they know I’ll come
And turn em down, I’m not a rapper to show out on

From the north side of Atlanta, Tropicana
Bubble gum in the blunt, bump, bump, bump
Beatin' in the trunk, in the donk cutaway
Straight beatin' like a tom-tom drum or a gun stump
Feel the cocaine that I snorted
Come on buddy, shut up when you see us fly by
Snapback full of buddha and a cooler full of High Lifes
Somebody gimme high five
Jeremy Scott Adidas on my feet, they got the biggest pinky ring
You ever seen upon a white boy's hand (Damn)
White boy going ham, y'all wearing tight jeans
Going glam, going, going, going, damn

High five
High five
High five

Yela put me on the elevator goin' up
Any rapper steppin' to me on the mic I'ma bury him
I ain't scared of bein' arrogant, never gets
Hard, but these bars hard like a barbarian
Plus a motherfucker represent Slumerican
Wolf passed me the torch, course I'ma carry it
Now I'm in the limelight, I might take a ho to see Twilight
Finger her inside the theater
And get some brain until I'm feelin' like Einstein
Why, my pleasure
I be at the party cuttin' lines on the dresser
Get a bitch high and undress her
Have her on the bed sceamin' OMG like I'm Usher when I touch her
Yes, sir
Ain't nobody fresher I'm the next big thing-thing
Homie, I just wanna see my neck piece swing-swing
Anybody wanna try to test me, ding-ding
Swingin' on 'em like I'm in a wrestling ring-ring
Kill a motherfucka like I'm Chris Benoit
You don't really wanna fuck with Rittz then, boy
Blow another kiss to them bitches, muah
Have 'em screamin', ""Oh Lord"" like a Christian choir
Man, I'm finally on fire
If they only knew how much time has gone by
I got Crown up in my Styrofoam I'm
Poppin' X pills and I'm rollin' like a Firestone tire
Can I get a high five?

Rittzo go schizo when I'm sippin' on the Cristal
Swingin' like I'm Klitschko 'til my fists swole
Fuck around and I'ma split yo' wig
Haters lookin' mad because I exploded
They was hopin' I would never get noticed
I don't think I've ever seen my dick so big
Got these bitches in they thongs like Sisqó did
In my six-four smokin' San Francisco shit
Ridin' 85 strapped like the Cisco kid
Want a sack, meet me where the cit-go is
Money stacked, can't get the shit folded
Kill a motherfucker then I dispose his
Dead body, bury him beneath a bed of roses
Mel Gibson bitch, I got my swisher lit
I'm 'bout to fill it with some killer, get a whiff of this
Pimp shit like fish and grits
Gwinnett County where they found me
In the valley of the crystal meth
So hello, good mornin'
Still sippin' coke with the Captain Morgan
Still reppin' Georgia, still fresh and gorgeous
Gotta a closet full of Pradas, Air Max and Jordans
Got a cutie smellin' fruity like an apple orchard
'Bout to torch it up, and you can tell by the smell I'm high
Everybody wishin' me well, likewise
Represent the Clintel, can I get a high five?

Wastin Time,The Life and Times of Jonny Valiant,2013.0,"Smoking weed and staying high
Partying till late at night
‘Cause all we do is drink
And all we do is smoke
And all we're doing is wastin’ time

High school dropout chapter one
On the way to school smoking massive blunts
My mom was at work, my dad was gone
It felt wrong, after first period we run
Inside the woods, back of Berkmar High on 29
Skipping school made the winter feel like summertime
Getting U's in every class but fuck if I don’t pass
I don’t plan to graduate I really wanna rhyme
In my cutlass I’m 16 meek leans
And vogues on that rapper shit
Call my mom at work and told her ""fuck high school
I ain’t never going back, I quit""
She cried her eyes out, all I did was laugh and click
Hung up on her
What a dick, looking back at it
That was the last thing she need
She would cry herself to sleep every night
‘Cause my dad just left for shit
Maybe this a reason for rebellion
Maybe it’s the reason I’m inhaling
Stealing, doing gas runs, breaking in the vacuum cleaners
Driving stolen cars like a hellion
Smoke another L then trying to act grown
But we was just children, snorting coke, taking acid
Another shotgun to the nose
10 years in a row
High watching time waste and pass us

Smoking weed and staying high
Partying till late at night
‘Cause all we do is drink
And all we do is smoke
And all we’re doing is wastin’ time
I know I need to change my life
But it’s hard for me to say goodbye
‘Cause all we do is drink
And all we do is smoke
And all we’re doing is wastin’ time

Kids my age done graduate in college
Some married some have some kids
Most of them have credit cards and cars
Or large houses, me I'm on that rapper shit
Which means I don’t got a job
I just have a couple hundred dollars
And a sack and a pack of cigs
Still smoke with the crew but it ain’t fun like it used to be
We got high, we don't laugh, we bitch about
Shit we don’t got funny enough
Somehow we always got money for drugs
Getting too old to be running for cops
Expired tags drunk driving with a gun in the glove
With no permit turned into a drug addict
Yesterday my dad called and he said that I concerned him
‘Cause I’m pale and i’m frail
When I sitting inside my house with my girlfriend like a hermit
Hurry pull the curtain
Working dead end jobs part time for the extra cash
But it never lasts, and i never had
Any backup plan, broke, running from a driver of a checkered cab
I need to catch a nap but
I’ve been up for 3 days doin meth with my so called better half
‘02 — '05 was a blur, it occurred to me one night, I was in the lab just


Well I was wastin time while I was pacing around
With that MD20/20
Rap game ain’t paying my pockets ain't banging, my fridgidaire still empty
Ribs are stickin, my mouth is dry, looking for another couch to occupy
Mama like come on baby maybe this ain’t for you
Give another 9 to 5 a try
But I rather sell bootleg movies out of my partner’s hooptie
Bang my music, roll a doobie
Sip some lean, hit the strip
Bang a bitch that probably average
But when she pops a pill she’s a savage
And I was half lit when I smashed it
Woke up at 2 there's an eighth
Think I’m losing my faith, good Lord ain’t have shit
Eviction notice fuck being focused
I’m overdosin on Jim Beam
Black out then I come to
Like what we sipping on, who got the green
‘Cause I need it
One 55 soaking wet, damn I ain’t eating
It’s a blessing I’m still breathing
‘Cause I was”",https://genius.com/Rittz-wastin-time-lyrics
Crown Royal,Next To Nothing,2014.0,"See what's goin' on in this mothafucker
Bitch pass me that mothafuckin blunt mothafuckin' trippin'
God damn lame, let me see what's goin' on.. What's happenin'

Check it out we taking shots, posted up
Drinking that Crown we toasting cups
Bitches looking at us like they so in love, they about to go uncut, no one’s frustrated we faded we celebrating life cause we made it we elevated and we smoking bud
The party doesn't end until we sober up
'Til your ladies layin' naked on the sofa drunk
Better come on in, get inside
Slick brought the pills Rowdy Bizzle brought the white
When I mix em' it's a feeling that I can't describe
But I guess I'll give my best to try
Daily shit can get too heavy to carry so every now and then my body needs the opposite of exercise
So I pull the plastic wrapper off the cap of my
Crown Royal bottle, somewhere in Gwinnett you'll find me

Chilling
I'm high
I'm feeling
Sublime
No killing
My vibe
If you're drinking raise your glasses high
Cause we ain't trippin' on the past or the afterlife
Cause right now we sippin' on that Crown Royal
Drunk when I pulled up, they already know what's in my cup, they know I'm sippin' on that Crown Royal
This ain't no champagne, they already know what's in my drank

I pull that crown up outta that purple bag
Crown up outta that purple bag
Crown up outta that purple bag
That purple bag
They know I'm sippin' on that Crown Royal

We've been turned up all day long, long day off
We gon' drink until the alcohol is gone
Neighbors saying that they're going to call the law
I ain't tripping on that blasé blah
Playing music loud as fuck and the house is a cloud of smoke
These hoes be showing titties like they been at Mardis Gras
Her song came on I guess that's when her bra came off
We gon' party all night like we got insomnia
Red cups in hand, some got spilled, I'm on tilt my eyes on slant
Lightweight drinkers they don't stand a chance
They're about to make a crash landing, trying to keep up with me Going shot for shot is not the move
My tolerance is through the roof I'm like a champion
Shot king wanna hang out bring a bottle of some Crown Royal
Bout' to go whole ham, oh man I'm



Nothing better than a bottle you just bought off the shelf
And you see the logo with the golden crown that sits on the pillow
You run your fingernail across the sticker right in the middle
And take the bottle out the bag and save the baggy for later
Maybe to put your weed inside or hide your jewelry or paper
You make a mixer with some soda or you shootin it straight up
With the reserve or the black or maple original flavor
You know that shit is my favorite, no other whiskey is player
Like that Crown

They know I'm sippin' on that
They know I'm sippin' on that
They know I'm sippin' on that",https://genius.com/Rittz-crown-royal-lyrics
The Formula,Top of the Line,2016.0,"Yeah
Nobody fucking with us
Rittz up in this bitch, when I spit I'm a warrior
Still got that Crown Royal in my cup, 'bout to pour it up
Biggest independent in the game, if you lame we're ignorin' ya
Everytime I get with Tech on a track it's historical
You better warn these hoes, I said...

Watch out for your spot, here I come, I'm warning ya
They said that I'm hot, really I was just warming up
Haters wanna see me flop, I’m outperforming 'em
Everywhere we go people point at us
They wanna join us 'cause we making noise
We was born with the formula
Strange Music got the formula
Tech N9na got the formula
White Jesus got the formula
People wanna point at us
They wanna join us 'cause we making noise
We was born with the formula

From Atlanta to the MO
From the second that I connected with Tech I set the precedents
Killin' a beat for Seven's effortless
Rappers stressing us, so what’s or who it do
You know who coming neck to neck with us
Nobody - I'm just resurrecting Keith Sweat for the heck of it
Sometimes I hate my aggression it gets the best of me
Like I was possessed and I need the exorcist
Until they hear me I keep rushin' up the field like Emmitt Smith
Cocky like a boxing champ
Do excuse me 'cause my mind is kinda like a lava lamp
Savage like I'm Macho Man
Go induce a logo on the side of my Versace lens
Thinking like I should be singing in a Mariachi band
Hola, que pasa guey?
You should really watch the way you stepping to me
Fuck around and now you lost a leg
And now you look like Drake in his Degrassi days
Crippled, lame as fuck, and it ain't tough for me to spot a rotten egg
Had to squash you, homie, I'm a giant, I'm colossal
You a cartoon drawer, motherfucker I'm Picasso
I just need a Xannie bar, a couple shots inside my nostril
When I'm Michael coming harder than Lamar inside a brothel
Fuck a rapper, I would rather be compared to Aristotle, where the bottle?
Simply miss, another Caribou, where the Lou?
Pussy fronting with a gun they scared of you, scared of who?
Somebody better go and let them know that what they better do is

Watch out for your spot, here I come, I'm warning ya
They said that I'm hot, really I was just warming up
Haters wanna see me flop, I’m outperforming 'em
Everywhere we go people point at us
They wanna join us 'cause we making noise
We was born with the formula
Strange Music got the formula
Tech N9na got the formula
White Jesus got the formula
People wanna point at us
They wanna join us 'cause we making noise
We was born with the formula

Pop pop pop pop off at the mouth
How I do it so fluid spew it, never soft as a mouse
Sick as sewage, I grew it too, it’s coolest talk at the house
Missou is the truest, you is foolish, flossin' about
Bickin' it back and I’m bein' a better one
Somethin' better was never done
If you wanna win this cheddarrun you really better go get a gun
Yes, I’m packin' the potion that’s never lackin' promotion
Have you stackin' and toastin' 'cause now you rappin' and grossin'
People set in they sin, 'bout the bread I’m makin'
That I made and never gave it, yo, where the heck is they been?
Said the label ain't charitable, gonna be checkin' they chin
The second they grin you really want it step and say when
But I’m in Monaco, on a boat, puffin' that chronicle
Dishonorable when they hate the Snake and Bat logo upon the coat
So if they wanna mope and leave us you can bet I'ma vote
Gassin' like Conoco and killin' 'em off is comical
You should prolly think about it 'fore you get up and you doubt it 'bout the pen game, definitely insane
I will become the in thing, music will then change
Take your family and friends brain, now they within Strange
The formula
Rittz got it to a T that’s why we gettin' the sound spread around now
With Tecca N9na right beside 'em you know it be goin' down diggy-down diggy-down-down!

Watch out for your spot, here I come, I'm warning ya
They said that I'm hot, really I was just warming up
Haters wanna see me flop, I’m outperforming 'em
Everywhere we go people point at us
They wanna join us 'cause we making noise
We was born with the formula

Yes sir
Kali put the rocket in the pocket and the feet upon the dresser
At first, so dope she wanna off the God, I'm guessin' I'm a bless 'er
Jonny and Donnie, we get money, no Illuminati
We show at the party, you feel like it? Let us in yo body
Oddity, how did he make 'em a commodity?
Hardly handle the bussin' it's a part of me
I feel like we're picking on other rappers and labels
They ain't sitting at the table with us, able as us
Maybe they division is 'cause they lacking in paper and we pay bills
What happened to some cray deals
Snake and the Bat, we lackin' on nothin', we'd be gauge strapped
Sayin' that rap it ain't 'bout nothin', they be frontin' frontin'
Takin' 'em back to putting paper in people's hands
So fecal on evil people, I'm making all the people dance
I know there'll be a lot of handgrabbin' and man baggin'
Even if they pants saggin' they be damn faggots
I'ma stay in creased khakis with a tan jacket
They can stand back 'cause Sam going ham sandwich
Bringing the same same mainstream game to the Strange team game 'cause the people really borin' ya
When we chop, it's kinda hard to understand we be
Speaking like a foreigner, maybe it's the formula

Watch out for your spot, here I come, I'm warning ya
They said that I'm hot, really I was just warming up
Haters wanna see me flop, I’m outperforming 'em
Everywhere we go people point at us
They wanna join us 'cause we making noise

Nowhere to Run,White Jesus,2011.0,"I want to run away
'Cause I know there's gotta be a better place
Sometimes I really want to run away
But the more I try the more I can't escape
'Cause there ain't nowhere to run
Instead I'm drunk
Praying to the Lord, saying, ""Here I come""
Sitting on my bed with a loaded gun
Pointed at my head
And then my girlfriend screams ""Put the gun away""
I told her love just saved the day
Let's pack our stuff and run away
From all this bullshit

Man I hate my life, my job, I feel like my days is awful
Working nine to five, but give her five to eleven
Limping in my front door looking tired and sweating
Last thing I feel like doing's going and writing a record
My fuckin' socks are soaking wet, my girl gotta go to bed
These opposite schedules getting harder to manage
Working in a kitchen with a bunch of Mexicans
And I swear these motherfuckers talk about me in Spanish
My only plan was to make it rapping
After so long you start thinking if this shit was meant to be it'd happen
If it wasn't for my homie Yelawolf believin' in me
I'd probably still be feeling like my dream was shattered
'Cause my team is scattered, but now I got a second chance
And it's time to get the fire back
At a young age, I done developed so many bad habits
I feel like I'mma have to snort a line to even try to write a rap
On top of that I can't afford the power bill
Rappin' ain't payin'; makin' nine dollars an hour still
Can't afford to have a kid, can't afford to put my girl on the pill
Plus I hate the way a condom feel
How's your family feel 'bout your music
Back when I was young they said that it was dumb and never gave a shit
I be smilin' now, when they tell me they proud
But then the climate turn around and say some racist shit
So it's strainin' my relationship
I told my girl I need her; I'd never leave her if I made it big
One day I want to marry you and raise a kid
Gone all night long but I ain't chasin' chicks
I'm trying to write but always feeling like I can't commit
Can't come with, the shit I want to say and vent
Instead, I'm steadily drowning, am I wastin' it?
Sometimes I wish I could escape from this

I want to run away
'Cause I know there's gotta be a better place
Sometimes I really want to run away
But the more I try the more I can't escape
'Cause there ain't nowhere to run
Instead I'm drunk
Praying to the Lord, saying, ""Here I come""
Sitting on my bed with a loaded gun
Pointed at my head
And then my girlfriend screams ""Put the gun away""
I told her love just saved the day
Let's pack our stuff and run away
From all this bullshit

I just missed another show 'cause I gotta work
If I try to request any more days off
Then my boss gon' fire me
He said he's tired of me tryin' him
I wanna tell him to go fuck himself
But I know ain't nobody hirin'
Besides I'm twenty-nine, my future's on the line
And my girlfriend rely on me, to try to iron these
Problems we created down entirely
A year ago, this time, we was in a bind, in a dire need
To find a place to live, we was 'bout to lose the crib
Had to get a job, that's exactly what I did
All for me is set and now this rapper shit is dead
Last Christmas, we ain't have the cash to get a gift
For each other, man, I'm sick of the struggle
Doing drugs made it easy to accept
That I settled getting used to, having nada
My doctor said I got a bleedin' ulcer in my tummy
But I still continue to shoot
Rot gut liquor in my stomach, trying to numb it
Can't afford Crown, so I'm sippin' on McCormicks
Tryna write a rap, but I can't think of a chorus
I bet I snort some meth I think some men are menopausal
And Wolf said ""Record execs checkin' for us
So you better step it up, they're scanning the performance""
Snap back in the music industry
I'm missing leads, sick of kissing ass
Man I question my endurance
So I pour another shot, tryna calm me some
Alcohol really can't resolve it none
Still pissed off, thinking everyone is dumb
'Cause I don't give a fuck what team LeBron is on
Whoever follows on, Twitter the comments on
My Facebook wall tellin' y'all what all I'm doin'
I'm a ray of sunshine, yeah, ball of fun
But they can look up and I'll be gone

I want to run away
'Cause I know there's gotta be a better place
Sometimes I really want to run away
But the more I try the more I can't escape
'Cause there ain't nowhere to run
Instead I'm drunk
Praying to the Lord, saying, ""Here I come""

(Phone Rings)
Pick up the fuckin' phone, pick up the goddamn phone
Ah fuck, oh goddammit
Baby if you get this call me back immediately this is a fuckin' emergency
I, I think I did too much shit my fuckin' heart feels like it's about to shut down
So call me back, quick as fuck please. Bye
(Verse 1)
Cocaine in my nostril hair
White lines chopped up on a cloudy mirror
Heart beat tellin’ me to slow it down
I ain't listenin’ and I can hear it loud n’ clear
My ribcage’s clinchin’ I’m pourin’ sweat
Still tryna snort lookin’ for a drip
Trippin’ out knowin’ I did too much
Havin’ a panic attack I feel short of breath
I shut the bathroom door n’ wet my face hopin’ that the water might cool me off
Tryna throw up in the toilet to get it out my system my nose started pourin’ blood
And that made it worse, the blood stained my shirt, im contemplatin’ wakin’ my parents up
Tellin’ the truth I’m overdosin’ on coke but maybe it’ll go away I’m just paranoid
I went back in the room and I shut the door
Got some Xanax to the dresser drawer
Here I go again mixin’ uppers and downers the sound of my heart like a tug o’ war
Cause all I heard as I laid in bed “please God lemme live I promise I will never do drugs no more”
Closed my eyes an realized that I wasn’t sure
I calmed down and I snorted more like goddamn
(Hook)
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
But if I die before I wake
I pray the Lord my soul to take
Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen
Let me see another day again
(Verse 2)
Holes in the gloves of the homeless man
Freezin’ as bad as the cold cement
On the corner beggin’ with an open hand
The weather man said it’s probably gunna snow again
There more holes in his clothes that expose his skin
Sick with pneumonia he’s old an slim
Hopin’ when somebody walks by and sees him freezing they may throw him a coat
The wind is unbearable, he hasn’t ate in days
Diggin’ through the trash find a burger that’s halfway eaten some packets a mayonnaise
Beggin’ all day nobody gave em change
He just lays in waste below the underpass
Last year he done almost froze to death
But this winter is much colder
The homeless shelter too full now there’s no one left to come rescue him
He’s outta breath they can’t give him a second wind the snowfall arrives
Prayin’ out loud “please God I apologize for anything I done wrong” he cried
He can’t feel his fingers his legs is numb
But everyone else is at home warm inside
He’s up under the bridge bout to freeze to death
Singin' to God I don’t wanna die like dear Lord
(Hook)
(Verse 3)
Life of her was so promising
Popular, a homecoming queen
Dreamed a becoming a doctor one day
She’s smart so her grades were astonishing
Her boyfriend gave her a promise ring
It was a prime example of puppy love
They act as if they was attached at the hip
Every time you saw one they was coupled up
Neither one of them drunk that much
But one night they got the invite to go n‘ drink with friends
It was started out to be a normal night
But change the course her life and have a tragic end
And then 10 shots later said they had to leave
Her friend said stay you okay to drive?
One of the dudes tried to take her keys
She said please you’re trippin’ I’m okay I’m fine
She got behind the wheel her boyfriend was trashed
On the highway goin’ way to fast
Hit a sharp corner round a bend and crashed
Her boyfriend’s head went through the windshield pass
Her neck gashed wide open her ribs are broken her boyfriend’s gone in the car he died
She hangin’ on waitin’ for the Jaws of Life to get her out
And she started to shut her eyes and she said God

Goin In,The Life and Times of Jonny Valiant,2013.0,"(Verse 1 Rittz)
The-the-the-they say who the white boy that done signed with strange
No security, but I don't gotta hide my chain
A lot of rappers cryin' now they see that i done came up
Maybe some of these babies need a diaper change
I'm driving drunk I'm bout to hydro-plane, but i don't care though
Flyer than a jet-liner at a air show
Custom jeremy scott i bet you wish you had a pair ho
Try to hit a lick i'll leave you stiffer than a scarecrow
Weed I'm smokin' purple like a varicose vein
Strange piece hangin' from the franco chain
A select few newcomers get approved from us
We just make fun of no way jose
I'm surprised i gotta fan base
Can't fake with em try and I'll deprive you of a handshake
Can't wait til my album drop
Ima cop a monte carlo supersport tee top and a mansion with a man cave
Choppin' up trees like a landscape, growin' plants
Motherfuckers wanna copy me like photo prints
I ain't changed signed a record deal with no advanced
Makin' show money on the road again blowin' grands, open hands
Coming from a brown nosing friends, like these groupies showin skin
They expose themselves
I got the competition overwhelmed
Swingin when i heard the openin' bell get KO'd or killed its like
(hook x2)
Just when you thought that you've seen it all
I come outta nowhere ring the alarm
Chain Tarzan swinging black beanie on
You know the word bitch sing along this shit goes like this
Bitch take cover, I'm goin' in
Bitch take cover, I'm goin' in
Better take cover, I'm goin' in
Uh oh, here we go again
(Verse 2 Rittz)
So fuck what the Mayans say
Cause I just set a record deal
When the plan is too annihilate
In 2013 I was warmin up on the Revival Tape
These motherfuckers sleeping now they see I'm wide awake
I got ‘em caught inside my web like a spider egg
I was already hot the booth is like a fire place
The bitches wouldn't give me the of time of day
Tryna' to beg for it, dick wetter than a wiper blade
It's rape when I stick it in 'em
Stacks so big hard to fit it in my Denim
Sippin Grey Goose straight with the hint of lemon
Buzz on the Street getting bigger, bet you wish you had a similar
Dilemma Northside representers Steve Reynolds down the indian trail
Weed greener than some spinach or kale
I'm like a chemical spill on the street
I'm toxic on that white boy shit
Slumerican Moshpit then we swap Chicks
Bout' to turn your girl into a straight whore
Wasted at the bar fuck a tab I don't pay for it
6 deep and the super 8 on the same floor
Geek crushing up speed with the AAA Card
Another 8 ball came when I came and carved my name
In the paved cement sippin Canadian Club, it's 8am
And I ain't been asleep yet
Let the games begin it's like
(Hook)
(Verse 3 Rittz)
I did it I'm guilty, my lyrics are filthy
I'm the rapper these fat bitches ask about
Should've asked around before you fuck with me
Now turn your ass around we're going ass to mouth
We're doing massive amounts of coke
What you thought I was lying on the remix of Cashin Out You wanna sniff Some get my dick sucked by a young bitch
Bumpin' a Taylor Swift song when they get you pissed off
It's fiction you can't believe every single word you hear in the record
We just be rhymin stupid dumby you a mummy
You ain't feeling me you're dead or you a zombie
Simple minded would you rather talk about illuminati? What you juice and do Pilates, you read and you meditate
Watch the history channel you really think
These rappers are part of some secret society
You probably think that David Blaine levitates
Probably think I'm hooked on meth I can't quit my habit
Ri ri ri rittz in this bitch and back at it
Bout' to kill another victim that shit is tragic
My dad's a maniac too I figure it's genetics
Synthetic no etiquette shit is just pathetic
You step to me you gonna fuck around and get Be-headed
On the stage butt naked drunk n' grabbin my dick, saying any girl that wanna suck it can grab it, I said it

Ain't nobody say shit, I guess they afraid if
They get out of line I'm 'bout to have to grave dig
A great big hole, kill him, leave them where you lay bitch
A.K.A Mr. Make-'em-Wanna-Rewrite
I guess I'm the one they want to be like
These guys get a feature from me study me on every record
Then they switch they whole style up
Homie I can see right through it
You ain't never used to chop like that
Now you talk about your girl and your struggle
Tryin' to get it, how you did a lot of soft
How you're pissed off at your boss
You ain't used to have the same 9 to 5 I had
Need to find your own lane, you and I might crash
Get in mine, hope you had a good time, (I'm back)
Rap game looking like Revenge of the Nerds
And ya pants and ya shirt too tight, is that plaid?
We ain't seeing eye to eye like I have an eye patch
No class having motherfucker you can die
You gone wish you had a life raft
My style is hijacked, did I kill him, my bad


With your lame ass socks showing, stop trolling
Going online posing with your Glock showing
You ain't never shot no one, stop lying you are not blowing
Trying to copy me, you thinking I would not notice
Cockroaches couldn't see me like they got some glaucoma
Comment under my photos bout the way that I look
I bet that I could get your lady to fuck
And suck dick, quicker than you
You said the two of you was in love
You're lame as fuck and I bet that you the type of dude to come up
And tell me that I look familiar, knowing damn well ya
Seen my videos and know my name and it would kill ya
Not to be lame so instead I gotta tell ya
Washed up rappers acting like I owe 'em something
When I needed them before I made it, they would never help ya
Lame ass homies wanna party at my crib
So they can drink up all my liquor they don’t ever buy they-self none
They say they recording, you ain’t got songs
Tryna say you performing, you ain’t got fans
But it’s hard to ignore 'em, lame motherfucker
Probably like, foam-a-sites, always rockin’ team Jordans
Lame ass bitches insecure and distorted
She tried shave her head on some Cassie shit
Now she thinkin’ she gorgeous
Never keeps a boyfriend, she fucking everybody, little nasty bitch
A lot of people in my city try to say that they relate to me
But still so many in Atlanta don’t appreciate a thing
I did or even heard of me
Its almost like they trained to be a slave to what they playin’ on the radio
They proceed to put me in a cage because my record label Strange
They need to listen, if they did they'd probably end up devastated
We don’t play, we put the music business in a Strangeulation
Other record labels lame to me, these motherfuckers L-A-F
Actin’ hard, never take a day off (they L-A-F)
Still rappin’, shit'll never pay off (they L-A-F)
Still trappin’ acting like a straight boss (they L-A-F)
Get arrested, they confessing, they decide to play ball (they L-A-F)
They be actin’ like we cooler than we are
If I met you doing music, don’t be stupid, this a job
You are not a friend of mine, just a dude I never call

Dork Rap,Last Call,2017.0,"Shit, it’s 4:44 and I'm talking on my money phone
I’ve been stuntin’ on ‘em all summer long
Your money gone, sweeter than some Honeycomb
Gettin’ money long till you’re freaking phone bill
Go on, cut it on
Got some real homeboys, never done me wrong
You could meet us at the top then if not, well
You can fuck off and run along
People flip on you like a somersault, doin’ cartwheels
Pourin’ top-shelf liquor in my cocktail
The CLI-N-TEL Crew comin' like the cartel
Double-timing, but that’s how I feel
Better stay up in your lane
Get in mine, hit the guardrail
Trynna work, but the cards dealt
And still flex on ‘em like I’m doing curls with a barbell
Traffic in and out my house like it’s a yard sale
I be in the crib with a blonde bombshell
Livin’ like a kingpin, did it with the inkpen
Shit I’m sayin’ make sense when it sink in
I’m distinctive, pinky ring pimp
Spittin’ shit that you think spin in distinction
Like the horn of a rhino, or elephant tusk
Soarin’ through the sky like a pelican does
Snort a bunch of white, when I’m feelin’ the buzz
You sayin' you supported, I can tell you're jealous of us
But that’s cool with me 'cause my fanbase thick
You're wounded again, make the band-aid stick
It’s a movement, you can shit the campaign, bitch
Light the fuse and I’m lit like a lampshade is
Every verse, I’m going on one of my rampages
Let the champagne fizz
I can show you how to get paid
But they just went and stole my template
Trynna copy me but they could never be this caliente, bitch

Time for me to bring the hardcore back
Got ‘em feeling like déjà vu
Anyone’ll get it when I’m on a warpath
And anybody in my way, I’m movin’
Then I snuck in when I seen the door crack
Then I made a new lane, make room
Little girl shit
They be on that dork rap (Swag)
Bunch of lame ass dudes
They don’t never spit no real shit
They be on that dork rap (I’m Lit)
How the fuck do you support that? (Yeah)
Thinkin’ that you killin’?
What I’m hearin’ is beyond whack (Sizzle)
It’s like the industry done gone mad
And I don't ever feel shit, every single song’s bad (Fire)
Where the fuck they find these boys at?
I be on that real shit, y’all be on that dork rap (Swag)
How the fuck could you support that?
Suck my dick!

Shit, I was gonna ease up
People complainin’ it’s hard to keep up
I’m like a lion inside of a herd of zebras
What, I gotta dumb it down now
'Cause everyone else sounds
Like a down south rapper with a lean buzz?
Shit, I’m like a volcano, I’m bout to erupt
Bunch of A-List rappers get a D-Plus
You say I need to go?
Please, I was better than ‘em way before the goatee
All I had was peach fuzz
Lots of refer stickin’ out my Nautica trunks
I was young and makin’ all my money from drugs
Rollin’ all my dollars, every one is a straw
I never listened to my momma
Told me “Johnny, be good.”
Finally made it as a rapper, never thought that I would
If I knew then what I know, I’d have slowed-down
Finished school, got a degree
'Czuse it was shocking to see
This rap game is like a comedy club
But you the one that’s on stage gettin’ laughed at
Puttin’ dye up in your braids, wearin’ man bags
Guess you need a place you can put your Tampax
Thinkin’ that you’re hard
With your tattooed tears and your hand tats
I ain’t hatin’ on the kids
Know a bunch of young dudes that’ll never get caught trynna flop that
One-track wonders, said they got racks comin’
All of a sudden, they got nothin’
'Cause they fucked ‘em on they contract, bitch

Time for me to bring the hardcore back
Got ‘em feeling like déjà vu
Anyone’ll get it when I’m on a warpath
And anybody in my way, I’m movin’

Suck my dick!

This is how y’all rap:
""I be dressed up in tie-dye
Got some old-school Vans on my feet
Bout’ to go for a bike ride
Got home, ordered crab rangoons and some fried rice
Tofu for my vegan friends
They spit bars, they don’t look like they rap though
My girl’s trynna be a creep again
All up in my phone, but she don’t know the passcode
I had it bad, yo
Almost didn’t finish college
I finally got a doctorate
I coulda been a brain surgeon
Fuck that! Imma do hip-hop instead!
Everything wavy like a waterbed
Spendin’ all my cash that my father lent
Ballin’ out hard on my father’s bread
Go and do shows for the college kids
And jump up and down on every song like ""Jump Around""
But I ain’t never heard of Everlast
Take water bottles and I sling ‘em at the crowd when I rap
You can see ‘em gettin’ wetter (swag)
Got a itch on my neck from my sweater tag
Double-XL on the freshman class
Say the word ‘Lit’ twenty times a day
And I say the word ‘Litty’ twenty times when I text you back
Sippin’ green tea out a liquor flask
Sold-out shows, ain’t no tickets left
Hella fresh, small-ass t-shirt
Something that a middle school kid would have
Everything that I wish I had, I got now
Gettin’ mad love when the boy’s back in town
Beside’s Drake, I'm the GOAT, people love my accent
I’m just glad Dork Rap’s a style

Hold up dude!
Did you hear what I fuckin’ just said!?
Did you hear all those bars!?
Holy shit, it’s so fuckin’ lit!
Dog! Dude, this shit’s litty!
Aight, let’s go to Whole Foods

Basket Case,Next To Nothing,2014.0,"Self, self-pity, self-self pity
Why the fuck is everybody else giddy?
I woke up and felt shitty
Matter fact I felt the same all week
Let down like my last album on the shelf sitting
And I think I might need help getting out of bed
Cause I'm here and I keep spinning out of thread
I'm my own worst critic and I gotta write a album
But I keep hating on myself, it's like I get obsessed
Cause I hate what I write, say something tight
I be thinking too much wondering what they gonna like
I don't got a lot of fans, I'm afraid that I might
Let 'em down if what I make don't relate to them right
If it don't, then they ain't gonna buy my record
And if my second doesn't sell better than the last
I'mma owe the record label cash
So it's hard to relax and write raps
I be losing concentration sometimes
I look at what they saying online
Somebody unfollowed me and call me out cause I ain't respond
I'm behind on my deadline and I got a home life
To juggle ain't no free-time
My manager clowning, ""what you write another deep song?
What is it this time, your lady, your struggle trying to be some{thing}?""
Not in the mood to write a weed song
I take the beat and give myself a mental beat-down when I rap

I'm my own worst enemy the energy I have's a waste
Cause I use it battling myself cause I'm a basket case
(Da, da, da, da) I'm a basket case
(Da, da, da, da) I'm a basket case
Staring at this glass of whiskey, wishin' I would pass away
But I'm always wishing for the worst cause I'm a basket case
(Da, da, da, da) I'm a basket case
(Da, da, da, da) I'm a basket case

I can't have conversation with rappers
I'm not an asshole to anyone unless I have a reason to be
But God forbid if they ever had a buzz or a name
Then they feel like we are equal, and these dudes always want a feature for free
I try to network and help 'em out, I just gave 'em a tweet
But I'm starting to wonder if the shoe was on the other foot
Would these motherfuckers do the same favor for me?
But, on the other hand, people think I'm all famous
I ain't half as paid as you think, when I tell 'em what the price is
To get me on a record they act like it's too expensive just to pay me a G
And I'm starting to feel guilty
Cause I'm known as the guy who never quit and never gave up his dreams
So a bunch of dudes tell me that I gave them motivation
Not to quit and they gon' try to do the same thing as me but
Only difference is, I spent fifteen plus years studying my favorite MCs
So I kept getting better some of y'all ain't got it, can't hear it, but it's blatant to me
And I don't want to hurt their feelings so I tell 'em that the music that they making is tight
But your image looks bad, and you suck, and you need to give up, and you're wasting your life
And it's all my fault... damn

I'm my own worst enemy the energy I have's a waste
Cause I use it battling myself cause I'm a basket case
(Da, da, da, da) I'm a basket case
(Da, da, da, da) I'm a basket case
Staring at this glass of whiskey, wishin' I would pass away
But I'm always wishing for the worst cause I'm a basket case
(Da, da, da, da) I'm a basket case
(Da, da, da, da) I'm a basket case

They tell me that I need to tweet more, but I feel kind of immature, typing my thoughts online
Plus the fans that I got will probably hate me if they knew what type of shit that crossed my mind
Cause I hate rap
Let me take that back, I just hate whack rappers for the most part
Even though I rap fast, I don't like when people try to impress me with double-time
And they be swearing that they go so hard
They don't really even say shit
Anyone can rhyme, thinkin' and drinkin' and sinkin'
Inside my Lincoln and think it's dope, it ain't about the speed
You gotta make it make sense
And did I mention that I really hate fake fans?
I don't understand how one minute everyone could be on your dick and they say you hot
A year later the same fans steady be talkin' shit 'bout that rapper Actin' like they forgot
That's how the shit works
First they love you, then they hate you, then they love you again
You gotta toughen your skin
This kind of shit hurts
This music industry is dumb, dumber than the comments on YouTube
Saying that I use the N-Word? (Hell Naw)
I don't rap like that, I don't hang around white boys who act like that
I done said too much, 'bout to snap, I'm mad
At the world, even I don't really have my back when I rap it's like... damn

I'm my own worst enemy the energy I have's a waste
Cause I use it battling myself cause I'm a basket case
(Da, da, da, da) I'm a basket case
(Da, da, da, da) I'm a basket case
Staring at this glass of whiskey, wishin' I would pass away
But I'm always wishing for the worst cause I'm a basket case

And they rolling up a jointer,
 
smoking that country stash
You ain’t never seen a bull rider bumping UGK
Nah homie, you ain’t never seen that
Fuck it, Peep
Out the bucket seat
Hip hop make em all lean back
Make a ping pong ball jealous of the bounce
Chevrolet sitting tall like a cloud
Yeah, pick another trailer park girl up
Dirty blonde eat a , ding dong, get out
Yeah, Imma let the lid out, fuck puffing in this jar, lightning bug
Southern hospitality, but I hospitalize you cause I’m nice enough
To spot a punk like a homophobic
I’m on it, my opponents know it
Get your money up D-boy
I ain’t a D-boy, but my folks they grow it
Done clipped the bud and done sold it
I been sipping Bud, you ain’t noticed?
I’m in the bible belt like a church, in the lobby
With an offering tray for that profit


Let me get started
Targeting artists, ain’t no dodging em, lodging them
Cause they fraudulous,
 yeah, my ho might been sporting shit
No tours and shit, 
no super Nintendo, but I got cartridges
Cartman shit, 
working my big old tool like I know carpentry
Pardon me it’s the, nigga you know me, the hottest commodity
Probably catch me posted at penny province in poverty
Cause they copping it, stopping me, nope
No  copping me, nope
P-O-T-B-E-Double-L, why the hell they ride my tail?
I’ll slow it down a minute (what?)
Cause I ain’t been around a minute
These niggas feeling themselves cause I let em borrow the crown a minute
And I'll admit I get beside myself sometimes
Only cause I know I got dope rhymes
And my punch lines will fuck wit yo mind
I’m bucking, 'bout my


I am a real Slumerican
Told Yelawolf he can swear me in
I got a heavy double barrel in my box Chevy
When my album drop, everybody scared again
And I’m prepared to win at all costs
Y’all talk a lot of shit, trying to tear my skin
And rumor has it I’m crazy, I need to see a therapist
Well if the shoe fits, fuck it I'mma wear it then
Cause I’m a go getter,
 other squares pretend
I’m bout to turn up like a sombrero brim
I'm kinda like a modern day Larry Flynt
It’s Slum shit,
 
baby fuck Katy Perry fans
I rep Atlanta, I ain’t never been to Paris, France
I switch lanes, crossing over like I’m Jeremy Lin
You can admire me, don’t let me catch you staring pimp
I’m like a great white shark in this aquarium
When I was young, ain't no kids out caroling
Around the holidays, they were pistol carrying
In despair, getting paper was imperative
I'm reaching in my pocket, only thing there was lint
With lack of parentin', no one to spare a cent
We suited up in all black and a pair of timbs
And ran up in a local baller's house ""Now lay it down
Motherfucker, show me where it is
I’m about to take that profit""",https://genius.com/Rittz-profit-lyrics

Paving, the way, was embraced, by the slum

Top Of The Line, yeah

I suppose that your eyes were closed the whole time
I've been on the rise for almost five years
But most of my peers they hope I nose dived
Like an aircraft that crashed
They congrats you, dap you
When your back is turned they throw knives
I ain't handicapped or slow or no average Joe
I see past the smokin' strobelight
Put me up against your favourite rapper
You sayin' snap and harder than me, close but no dice
The difference be in my consistency and I don't need MC's to ghost write
Who you know that pitch that always throws strikes
Everytime I get the ball across the goal line
I done made it off the bottom on the slow climb
If you talking to my dogs they all gon' cosign
And I'm sitting on a gold mine (Gold Mine!)
Songs I write are from the heart it ain't meant for the closed mind (Closed Mind!)
This more than bars they're metaphors, it's a cure for the soul, I, (Soul, I!)
Seal with the end of your rope and now I'm right here, closing by
Third time's a charm, I already let them know, twice

Let me set the record straight I'm the best, there ain't no one better, fuckin' let the rest debate
I accept the hate that'll desecrate I just set the pace
Set to detonate, some that disagree
Must be deaf cause they, underestimate
Me, but that's okay
I'mma let you scream, let it resonate
Till they remember my name, I'm Rittz!

Bitch and I'm back in the face like paow!
Ain't nobody gonna come and take my crown
They be takin' me for granted I be killin' everything you hearin'
Gonna lyrically raise eyebrows
We ain't got to double time I do it 8 Mile style
Born in P.A. and was raised down South
When I'm in your city hit the stage
I bounce, from the north side up, A-Town down
Some of these MC's need CPR
Listen to the wack MP3's I'm bored
Your video is hard for me to sit through
Like Kanye's speech at the MTV Awards
(You on point Rittz?) Sí señor
I got a pair of new shoes you probably never seen before
I used to be dead broke with some cheap Louis V decor, inside a Regal that was leakin' oil
But now I cost five G's for a feature the middle finger up begging for a confrontation
And #FuckAnyoneWhoSaysHashtagInAConversation
Man I throw the peace sign, As-salamu alaykum
Cli-N-Tel was the crew and the congregation
People thinkin' I've become complacent
I'm just lookin' at the game feelin' nauseated
Lotta' rappers goin' pop like a condom breakin'
Sick of concentratin' on my skills when it's gonna be useless (Gonna be useless)
All the music I hear just sounds the same
A bunch of wannabe Futures
You wanna be Eazy
You gotta be Ruthless
You wanna be me
Then you gotta be the smoothest
Gonna seem breezy watchin' me do this
Got a deep teacher and follow me students
Hit 'em with the woah (woah!)
That work everytime
Then we down start singing for the hoes (ho!)
Trippin off that line and some punk
Might overdose, off this dope I write
A lotta rappers wanna act like rock stars
When they square as fuck but that's me for real
I got the pills and I'm fucking with a soft heart
Fist fight with my girl in the hotel punching the mirror
Breaking the door and the armoire
Shit I can't recall the last 15 years wishing I could do an interview with Nardwuar
I got an early morning flight to Hartsfield
Taking airplane shots witha chilli cheese slaw dog
Never gonna fall off, man I know I'm on now
Got a bunch of unknown numbers in my call log
People got me all wrong
See my hair and the beanie and they get the wrong idea
Say I look homeless shit my shoes 200 my shades 250 a pair
Watch out you'll go blind
By the diamonds the side of my pinky that sparkle and shine
They call me Rittz, bitch

She was irate cause she got off work late for the second time this week
Racing home in a white Ford Escape
Had a nice quiet place by the lake up in Washington state
Her fiancee was paid but he had to take a trip out to Vegas and they ain't got no family
Or neighbors close by so she called him on the phone and let him know that she had made it home safe
Might have spoke too soon, as soon as she went inside her bedroom a man with a mask lashed out from inside of the closet
Put a knife up to her neck and said ""Be quiet, try to scream and you'll be dead""
Ignoring what he said she screamed, it seemed to piss him off he shoved one of his gloves into her mouth
Tied her hands behind her back then he stabbed her in the abdomen and threw her on the bed
For 3 hours straight he tortured and raped her she tried to pray and fake like she was dead
She bled so much she knew that she was dying, closed her eyes
And when she opened them she noticed he was gone
Somehow she managed to make her wrists slide out of zip-ties
Used all of her strength crawling on the floor to lock the bedroom door
She made it to the nightstand and grabbed the phone and called 9-1-1

He was a single parent that had retired, him and his teen daughter live together
He never had problems with her as a kid
But she been misbehaving lately, that's a part of growing up
She was so in love with her new boyfriend - he was older
Her father told her he didn't want her seeing him
Cause she and him were skipping school just to sleep with him
And he could tell that they'd been doing drugs
Her father took her cell phone and car keys from her as punishment
Even threatened to send her to live with her momma
200 miles away but that would only make her hate him
Started plotting on her dad
One night when he sleeping he figured that he was dreaming cause he opened up his eyes
Saw his daughter staring at him from the bottom of his bed
And her boyfriend was standing right above him with a bat
Before he could react, or try to defend himself against her boyfriend, all you heard was whack
He hit him repeatedly, his daughter acted
Emotionless watching his blood splatter on the wall
Beat him to a bloody pulp for at least thirty minutes
There were fragments of his skull on the bed
Then her boyfriend left
Cracked the window, grabbed the telephone
She tried to play it off and called 9-1-1

Heaven,The Life and Times of Jonny Valiant,2013.0,"I wrote this song on mushrooms, I get all﻿ fucked up
It's like an illusion, I throw up, look in the toilet
It's like paradise, it felt so great

Have you ever been to outer space?
Tour bus living liquor bottles all over, no counter space
Evaluating 'em I'm like what's the future's hard to calculate (Calculate)
Pissed off, but you gotta look at everybody putting on a smiley face
Like you seen the sun shinning on a cloudy day
You like the overcast you really hope it's that
Cause you like the darkness it's comforts you
Like-like-like-like-like a compass do
Buzzer 'em like you just-just blew a cazoo
Higher than a middle school kid huffing glue
Suckin' helium out from the balloon
Vick’s vapor rub sticks, we snort for fun
Knowing that the real shit was coming soon
And Stevie Wonder song the tune I heard it backwards
(Erus Rof) closed my eyes and saw blackbirds
Eating on a dead raccoon
Started thinking back when I was scared to say bad words
Before for the internet making up Facebook passwords
I see Casper floating in my room
When I pray maybe I should come down and pray afterwords
People kill deer for their antlers
I didn't really wanna pet one
I didn't really wanna let one live
On some futuristic shit like a Jetsons
Yes man flirting with my home boy's step mom
Thumbin' through my pop's old record collection
Take a sniff then I drift into depth with my headphones
Staying on the floor in the restroom yes I'm

Looking at the world with my eye lids shut
We give it all to live but when we die then what
My high's electrifying like the lightning struck
I look up in the sky and hope that I end up

Fuck it where's the Canadian mist
Now I'm on some plastic bottle drinking shit
And my tour manager's looking for somewhere to sink his dick

Two bottles of ways to swim badadduuu duduuu
And I mean that from the bottom of my nuts

In a minute, but fuck it truthfully
I've yet to hear
You come wack on the track
Matter of fact, I hit your manager up about a feature
You ever check your mail?
You be on Twitter still?
I think I messaged you a couple days ago
You ain’t responded yet
You snapped on a Krizz Kaliko record
You ever think you gonna get to do a song with Tech?
You really snort coke like you say you do in your record?
If so then let me know because I got the soft on deck
I thought you would suck when I first saw you
Then I listened to you I was shocked, much respect
I really thought you was black
When I heard you on Box Chevy
Really I never checked on it to see who you was
I see you on tour with Wolf now
Do you think could sign this?
You think that we could speak on the bus?
Can I bust a freestyle for you
Me and you are just alike listen to me I rap fast like you
Me and my homeboy got some produced beats
I think that you would like some of the track we do
You wanna shot? You wanna bump?
You wanna smoke? You want some hoes?
I got a bitch that'll give us all head in a hotel room
You wanna go?
Does your girl really trip on you when you be on the road?
Is she the one you talk about in “Sleep At Night”?
Is that her in the video?
Nah dummy that's an actress
My real girlfriend at home pissed
Cause she on Facebook and saw me take a picture with a fat bitch
What you like fat chicks? You like black chicks?
Why you so pussy whipped I never see you mack chicks
I don't rap to get the women
I just want a wife, and a normal life one day
I never had shit
Last year I was cooking in the kitchen
One night I made Toni Braxton a piece of catfish
Getting off work sweating, changing my clothes
Goin' to a show wearing Gold
Frontin' like I had bread
Limping on my last leg
But you got bread now right?
Can you hook me up with a job?
You never wanna pick up when I call
All my homies looking at me like they got some on the prob
But where your hair at dog?
I hope you ain't cut it off
I play your music all the time, my homies say you're the shit
Besides Eminem, them, him and him
I swear to God you are the best
I said nah, I'm next

Turning Up the Bottle,Next To Nothing,2014.0,"He was a cook at a dead-end job, 26-years-old
She moved back to Atlanta, fucked over by her father she had got disowned
He was a frustrated rapper that after so long he done quit and lost hope
She was addicted to meth, so was everybody living in her household
Both of them worked on the daytime shift
On break time kicked it, the sparks just flew
She said she heard through the grapevine, he had a girlfriend
He told her ""Nah we're through""
But what they had in common was a fucked up life
Shit she experienced, he had gone through, too
Both of them thought that the world was against them
Childhood innocence gone too soon
They hooked up, later she moved in
With him and his parents, she was detoxing
He did meth, too, it helped him write songs
But he quit writing shit the minute she got clean
You would think that things got better but they didn't
Cause instead of doing drugs they'd just sit around and drink
Day in and day out cause they hate being sober, they broke as a joke, and they think that

Everything is bad, but it all seems OK
When we're turning up the bottle
Trying to see the sun but the sky seems so gray
Drowning in our sorrow
Oh, oh, o-oh
Turning up the bottle
Oh, oh, o-oh
Drowning in our sorrow

His parents kicked him out, they was sick of the drinking, it was constant
They moved in with her sister and her fiance at the spot where her mom lived
Now they can drink without a conscience, no one was there to tell them it was time to grow up
She worked nights at the bar, but they shared one car, he would pick her up and drive home drunk
When they're drinking was the only time that life don't suck
Only problem was, they would fight so much
Had to hide any guns in the house cause they might go nuts
Shoot each other, or they might go fuck
It could go either way, '09 came, adios to '08
Both of them got laid off, so did her mom and her sister
Facing foreclosure with nowhere to stay
No dough put away, Ramon Noodles every night
They applied everywhere to try to get a job
Looking like white trash, wearing hand-me-down clothes
To the job interviews, still nobody ever called
Running out of time, running out of alcohol
Maybe if they sobered up then the shit would change
But instead they keep on emptying the piggy bank
Up in the liquor store buying something cheap to drank, because


He went to a specialist, the doctor said he had an ulcer in his stomach
Probably cause he'd eat and then he'd tried to make himself throw up and vomit
Making room so he could drink cause he's a drunk and he's a glutton but the combination's common
But the fact that he was young with stomach problems was alarming
But the ulcer wasn't cancerous, right then he made a promise to his mama
He would quit, he's full of shit he wasn't honest
Cause he only went a month and started chugging out the bottle
She was getting sick and always shaking, she's afraid
Cause everything she ate was coming up, one day she made a date
To see the doctor, told him she’s an alcoholic
So they checked her liver noticed the aluminum and fluids were below the level
Plus the color of her skin and eyes had turned a tone of yellow
Indicating that she may have got cirrhosis of the liver or maybe hepatitis
Maybe nothing, told her not to drink a lick of liquor
But she never listens, turning up that bottle…

Always Gon’ Be,The Life and Times of Jonny Valiant,2013.0,"Cameras flashing
Spot lights getting hot on me like
Turn this suntan to ashes
And you cannot match it
I done blew up
And covered the competition in volcanic ashes
Let us trend the fashion new clothes a plus
Yelawolf changed my life so much it chokes me up
You talk about me when I was broke and
He gave me the hope I lost
And now I'm gone on the road so much
And I know you're lonely love
I just wish we could touch through the phone but just
Stay focused and note that I'm trying to make a living for the both of us
And when the chuckle up
I might close enough to finally buy us a car
With her own apartment he embark a dream
On stage in saw to rin
A shy town thinking that you'll get drunk and screams
I'm a feel like a sailor of a sicker submarine
Tryin to keep both of our heads above the water
I know you want kids but we live with your mom
How the fuck am I supposed to become a father
When I'm spending my last hundred dollars on studio time
But you ain't ever gave a fuck about bread
I'm a give you the life you deserve one day
While you crying all alone in our bed
I'm on the bus and the bunk
Having dreams barbequing with a back yard for the dog to run
Been gone so long it feels weird talking on the phone
I freaking knew it I be coming home
Fuck rap, you're my backbone
When I'm at home with you it's like I'm really in my comfort zone
A thousand miles away looking at the sky and pray
And tell God you ain't all alone
 (Mike Posner)
Cause I've been thinking about you all day
And I've been walking down this hallway
And now your love just seems so far away
But maybe that's the way it's always gon be
And every day my heart aches
I'm just sitting in this dark place
And now your love just seems so far away
But maybe that's the way it's always gon be

Fights on facebook
All you see these pics they took with me
You can't believe the hype
Every night we fight about girls you see
On the internet, thinking I'm cheating
And I gotta defend myself from bullshit you accused me
You play gotta do music though
Think I'm all late tripping getting groupie love
Crying to me is unnecessary
Losing you is the last thing I want
If only you could trust, then I'd miss you as much as you miss me
And I wish we could be on the couch together
But we ain't got no cheddar
No kind of credit history can we deserve better
Can't accept the mysery I know you had a real hard life
And it's harder when I'm gone
And I promise you one day shit will make sense
It will be alright
I sent flowers to your job today
I put my headphones on and I played our song
No I mean the bicycles I just got done
Sorry that you had to wait up long
So many nights when we get up on each other
Really fighting cause I can't come home
Got a hotel room just to face time with you tonight
Don't put make up on
Because your face just looks so beautiful
And I promise that I'm always gonna be true to you
So many people travelling in pursue of true love
But never get the feeling that I do from you
So many human beings tryin live their whole life with their soulmate
But I found mine
While you laid up in the house crying
We both been counting on time

Cause I've been thinking about you all day
And I've been walking down this hallway
And now you love to see so far away
But maybe that's the way it's always gon be

MVP,Top of the Line,2016.0,"Go 'head and roll the red carpet out
Cause everywhere I walk on a martyr route
Just when you thought the game was garbage and watered down
I came to be the saviour seen 'em wading in the water
Started preying on 'em sort of like a shark or a crocodile
Uh I got bars like I was brought up with slaughterhouse
But say my name and you'll get sought out and shot up, blaow!
I got a quarter ounce of soft and a lot of crown
And a bitch to wanna' party, grab my card and I'll chop it out
Her heart was beating uncontrollably she dialed 911
And told the operator ""sorry I pocket dialed""
I told her to walk it out but now she's calming down enjoying it
Annoying bitch keep trying to blow me with cotton mouth
I told her gag on it started making her cry
That turned me on that's why I came before her make up could dry
I want the bitch to leave can't find a way to say it polite
I told her there's an Uber waiting started waving goodbye
That never happened, half of what rappers say is a lie
But y'all don't mind like it's okay to get away with the crime
But it ain't shit to me cause breaking them off is just like a day at the office
And I don't mean the local paper supply get it?
Dwight, Jim, my pen's lightning
I've been vibrant, fire for a sizable time span
I get bent 'til my eyes squint
I'm in iHOP having steak with scrambled eggs on the side
When fans be coming up to catch a flick cause I'm one of the best there is
Bitches looking impressed from all the freshness that I exhibit
People say I rap too fast and play this track and reference it
And you forgave yourself for ever questioning my excellence
When it comes to self expression I'm a specialist
I pack a weapon for protection I ain't wrestling
They actin' deaf like they don't hear me though
They characters, they imitate like Jake the Snake and Rey Mysterio
Serial killer leave you dead, and left like, ""Cheerio!""
Talk so much online it's like I watch you dig your burial
Pop up on you when I'm on the road you looking shocked
Like you forgot that I was real like what you thought this was, the Jerry show?
Your reign on the top was temporary though
I'm shining on them like a diamond from Sierra Leone
On a high note they can't compare me to they baritone
Watch your mouth I got the knockout power of a Larry Holmes
Industry, triple G's, switching the delivery
Just to see how many people dissing me, kiss the ring
Seem like yesterday they used to push with the soliciting
Get you  so bad it's like I had a skin disease
Probably see me in your city Mr. Freeze, slicker G's
Crew be steady got the bullet steady whistling
Got the pistol whizzing by your head
Used to flex like you was tough, what the fuck you got muscular dystrophy?
You don't want me as an enemy, Rodney Dangerfield of rap
I get no respect, I'm 'bout to take what they don't give to me
Drink so much my liver need a detox
And me it probably be thought that I was about to blow with no freon
A big reality check and then I came to a complete stop
Funny 7 years later I would be on and I'll be here for eons
My name up in the neon light
Clintel crew, Rittz up in this BIATCH

It's funny everybody wanna' envy me, they wanna' envy me, envy me
Cause I'm the, cause I'm the motherfucking MVP

Indestructible,Last Call,2017.0,"Fell a victim to myself again
But who's gonna help me when
I need 'em
Pray, they prey on my demise they can smell the scent
I'm weak and losing strength
I see 'em
You think when you're sinking they won't let you drown
The ones that you trust come and kick while you're down
They stomp you enough you won't get off the ground
Anymore

When your worth feels under attack but you won't flee
When a person is shackled and trapped but they broke free
Double crossed, get stabbed in your back but you won't bleed
When it all falls flat but you're back up on both feet
In the end, you're indestructible

In the booth of the 214 on stage faking, you thinking it's all good
I was just in a green room
Had me crying looking at my lady lie in a pool of her own blood
Through a text, cut herself for something that I had done
Overseas, but I always get followed by bad luck
Bad time, I call on my homie but he ain't wanna console me
Instead he told me that Top of the Line sucked
He was buzzed like I was, going on Tech N9ne's buzz
Trying to fight the TM, I was in the wrong
I was sick, had untreated strep throat doctors didn't catch
Had a rash spreading up my arms
Spreading up my legs
A fever that stayed around for months
No days off, trippin, skin crawling in my bunk
Of course my voice would be hoarse for these huge crowds
I was dying, why the fuck he calling me a drunk
Damaging my reputation, need a restoration
Had to rest, to put a halt to all my calls
My homie think I'm dodging him outta desperation
He said he gonna kill himself, it's all my fault
This is deja vu, back in 2014 when I came home broke
Eight grand in the hole
Had to postpone having kids, owning a home
Gonna go through the motion alone 'cause

When your worth feels under attack but you won't flee
When a person is shackled and trapped but they broke free
Double crossed, get stabbed in your back but you won't bleed
When it all falls flat but you're back up on both feet
In the end, you're indestructible

Get comfortable, love the show
Adjust or fold the crutch you hold
You trusted those that cut your throat
That dug the hole, that stunt your growth
Disrupt the flow
The 'Net shot like it struck your pole with thunderbolts
You cut the flow that sucks you so, you search your soul, the bubble blowin'
You busted, poke and punch your hoes
You couldn't even walk on my shoe, barely scuffed the sole
And play a couple notes
Took a shot, smoke a blunt, maybe numb your nose like who cares
It's Rittz, bitch

Homie fresh up out of jail, violent environment
Tryin' hard to turn his life around and his mindset
Never had a nine-to-five, places he applied at
Said he wasn't hiring, he coming out retirement
I couldn't really blame him, hard to rearrange the wiring
Hear somebody bring the hotter game that they desiring
Entertaining, inquiring, cocaine pirates
Wrist game, whip-whip-whipping like a wire whisk
Scars on the skin been surviving in the fire pit
Hold on had 3rd degree burns
Gotta do your research on the people that you keep around assuming they believe in teamwork
Hate to see you coming up, wanna  see you reverse
Want us in the street curb when you tryna go straight
Always trying to throw shade but it never holds weight
But I got 'em in my scope, won't fold, won't break 'cause

When your worth feels under attack but you won't flee
When a person is shackled and trapped but they broke free
Double crossed, get stabbed in your back but you won't bleed
When it all falls flat but you're back up on both feet
In the end, you're indestructible",https://genius.com/Rittz-indestructible-lyrics

All the contempt they had balled up — in 'em eventually gets brought up
Bitching at me like I intended to just dog em
Look at my phone and notice I got a missed call from
One of my homies and next my text starts blowing up
There's a homie I knew growing up
A close friend but his text suggests that we ain't close enough
I started reading and lost my buzz
I was at a loss for words
A bunch of paragraphs telling me he salty
I never call him and cut him off like loss of love
That couldn't be more false, but it's always my fault
They drunk and mad at life, and on to vent at a scapegoat
Knew that they preventin' their true feelings
They got on about the money, they just wanna run around and tug at my raincoat
But they ain't really mad 'cause I don't call no more
They just jealous of the squad on tour
But all them dudes work hard, and I offered you a job before
But you expect to do nothing and get a dollar for it
Man I wish I had a dollar for the friends that I seen walkin' towards the same revolvin' door
Sayin' ""Fuck me"" with their middle fingers up
I used to forgive 'em but I'm no longer feelin' sorry for 'em
Homie, no wonder why they call you a - bitch
How the fuck a grown man gonna text
Another man, trippin', makin' threats
That he'd take his own life, blamin' him for his debts 'cause the steps he took
But all wrong should've said that all long
My little homie told me I was dead to him
Guess he went from bein' drunk to soberin' up, 'cause when I told him off to check his chin he try to say it's

Love!
This love ain't the same
They say it's love
They just love to complain
There ain't no love

All these leeches that I keep around me sucking the blood out my veins
There ain't no love (Nah)
Love
There ain't no love
This love got me drained
All these leeches that I keep around me sucking the blood out my veins
There ain't no love

They say you wanna lose a fan, you go fuck 'em
And said you can't be their idol on top of carnally touch 'em
I wanna be lovin' when I'm on the road alone it be suckin'
Performin', he clutchin' a Angel when they corner me bussin'
I met a lot of great women on the road
Carefully pick it N9na didn't get wit the ho's
I'm the ticket to kick it when they wanna visit the shows
But in time if you stick it and she dig it then it corrodes, slowly
'Cause when they really get to know me, solely
They wanna hold me, hopin' that we grow ta be oldies
In Holy matrimony, snatch a Brodie
From rap, the road, see a sad emoji
'Cause that will never happen, I'll be forever rappin'
They never do see me enough to be my better half
And the love they had begins to dwindle
All of the huge fan lovin' is out the window
All of the nights full of life smokin' the indo'
All of the wife'n and the lights off in the limo
All of the pipe'n and fights 'cause of a bimbo
Begins to crescendo, now the love is in limbo
Then no, memo when you come back and try to rekindle
You given no info, they will never again show
Believin' in you is over like Shinto
Makin' a good nigga wanna become a nympho
That ain't love, walk around the club and fuck everybody
They lovin' the music and wanna give you their body
And share naughty erotic fantasies in the closet
But when you gotta go they be sobbin' and pause it
Not a fan and never was
Got a little personal with him and got a grudge
And never be in a crowd, even with a bigger buzz
Because a kiss and a hug and plug, you want to shove a thug, it ain't

Love!
This love ain't the same
They say it's love
They just love to complain
There ain't no love
This love got me drained
All these leeches that I keep around me sucking the blood out my veins
There ain't no love (Nah)

I'm thinking she's fucking her ex and I just whooped his ass

Hoping the weed gives me relief
Try to envision the future but how can I possibly succeed
My dreams are bleak, I need to go to church
Hate when people preach, faithfully believe in Jesus
Recently The Devil won't leave me be
My lady just told me she pregnant and begging that we can keep The baby that she conceived
I wouldn't consider it, told her we got to get rid of it
Why are you tripping and acting like you don't remember what we agreed
Was thinking about myself, selfish and overwhelmed
I just paid to kill my unborn child
The guilt was setting in, I felt like filth
There's people picketing outside this building

주님 이제 오늘 사하시고 은혜 주심을 감사합니다

Dear Lord, thank you for letting me be here to see another day again
I'm grateful to be alive, God bless the souls that came and went, I'm so lucky...
To have a good family that loves me
Please let my girl, know how much I love her
Sorry that we're both so unhealthy
I feel so guilty...
Every time I pray I feel like I ask you to help me
I don't pray with the hopes to get wealthy
I just want success, I know it sounds selfish
I've always been a screw up...
I finally got the chance to fix it
I signed a record deal after all these years
I wish I was more optimistic,
I'm really just scared...
What if they don't like what they hear?
What if I don't make a career out of music?
What am I supposed to do then?
I'm always getting judged...
I hate to see my face in the mirror
I done wrote about everything, so many times
I don't have inspiration to spare
I'm barely even here
I've been out on the road
And I feel like I've been gone all year
Even when I'm home there's so much pressure to be Rittz
It's hard to feel like I'm all there
So many wish, they could rap for a living
So complaining about it, it's unfair
Some days I feel like I've been living in a dream
Other times feeling like a nightmare
And I need some ideas
Cause I got a bunch of songs to write
And I'm feeling like my future all depends on this
Gotta rid myself of mental blocks and censorships
Gotta get some confidence back in my penmanship
I don't wanna disappoint the fans who listening
Cause they expecting something incredible in the end
Without them, I'm nothing as I begin to get my stride back
I remember when I was a kid
And my dad, he would teach me how to play the guitar
Me and my brother would pretend that we was in a band
Musicians in my family was dreaming to be stars
Only to condensate to something that you didn't attend, at music
Must've been playing, I'm the chosen one
So I'mma quit tripping and get behind this mic and rhyme
Amen, Slumerican

Blow,Next To Nothing,2014.0,"I just got some drank, I just hit some herb
Took a couple shots, instantly I got the urge
I called my homie’s phone, he asked me where I am
I told him I’m at the crib, come thru and bring a couple grams
This ain’t every day, this ain’t once a week
But sometimes when I get drunk, all I wanna do is geek
So we started snorting lines, when it drained it tasted sweet
You could tell that shit was good, my mouth was crooked trying to speak
Chillin’ with my homie: me, him, and my girl
When we’re on that cocaine, it’s us against the world
Did 1 line, 2 line, 3 lines, 4 lines, 5 lines in a row
My hands are gettin’ clammy, it’s fuckin’ up my nose
But here I go, I’m on that…

Blow (blow), oh shit
I be on that blow, and I said I’m gon’ quit
I’m fucked up on that blow (blow), oh shit
And I really hope I don’t end up overdosing
Here we go again
I’m on that blow (blow), on that blo-o-ow
On that blow (blow), oh shit
I’m fucked up on that blow (blow), on that blo-o-ow
On that blow (blow), oh shit

This blow will make you talk, drinking while we chat
Talking bout our problems, yapping about the past
But that shit is a secret if anybody asks
Trying to come down with them Xanax, we’re popping Lortabs
Last time we was high, my girl done spilled her glass
The coke was on the table, that drink got in the bag
So we started freaking out cause that was all we had
We tried to microwave it, had to throw it in the trash
Seven in the morning, starting to  see the sun
Got one more line left, one a piece until it’s done
I pick up a CD case and spill that shit cause I was drunk
But instead of saying fuck it, tried to snort it off the rug
Cause we was fucked up on that…

Blow (blow), oh shit
I be on that blow, and I said I’m gon’ quit
I’m fucked up on that blow (blow), oh shit
And I really hope I don’t end up overdosin’
Here we go again

KISA,Top of the Line,2016.0,"Mom and Dad split up when she was just a kid, she lost all her trust, her trust in relationships, the unfaithfulness;
It was a shame
Both of them cheated, leaving her a non-believer in falling in love
She was jaded since day one, looking for someone to blame
She never really had shit, she don't give a fuck about how much you got, she don't care if it's a little or a lot, no matter what she bought
She was lied to so many times by guys in disguise, trying to be something they not
I kept it real so I'm hoping that she'll let me get a shot
I told her I ain't gon' try to fill her head up with fairytales
And I know that she was scared as hell
You let your guard down so  you gotta wear a shell
Cause every male that ever said it was gonna be forever bailed
Her pops left out the door so fast like a jetpack was on his back
Got abused by her step-dad, the only way to get attention was a sex act
Momma never taught her to respect herself
She had to learn on her own, had a lot of obstacles, and barriers that herd her along
Beneath the surface was a girl in search of true love, she's a queen that deserves to be crowned
And I can recall the first time I seen her, I was in awe
It was like I had a crystal ball, it was her and I
And I ain't tryna say you about to have the perfect life because I heard goodbye girl

Cause I'm gon' be your knight in shining armor
And everything will be okay
Together we gon' fight through all your problems
Until they all go away
Cause I'm gon' be your knight in shining armor
And everything will be okay
And you can find me right beside my woman
She's the one, she's my soulmate

We both used to be heavy into drugs, until we finally got each other clean
Used to fuck on a hand-me down twin bed, now we make love on a California King
Had to share a car, working double shifts, Christmas came around, couldn't buy each other gifts
Summertime couldn't turn on the A/C, Fan's blowin in our face while we eating frozen fish
Had to go and pretend like we had our own place
Saving up to stay up in a cheap motel
Now we got a two car garage, three cars, a big house, paying bills we don't need no help
65 inch T.V., she don't care about no money, she just love me, and I feel the same for her
Told her she don't gotta work, kick your feet up
She's just about to get the life she deserve

Cause I'm gon' be your knight in shining armor
And everything will be okay
Together we gon' fight through all your problems
Until they all go away
Cause I'm gon' be your knight in shining armor
And everything will be okay
And you can find me right beside my woman
She's the one, she's my soulmate

Cause even when the times got hard we were always laughing
Even if we were single, nobody else is gonna have us
We're both so crazy, 10 years in never lost attraction
And there's gotta be a god cause he crossed our paths when we were lost and had it with the dating game
I pulled a David Blaine inside the bed, never lost the magic
Got her dripping like I took her white water rafting
And I know there's gonna be some people that'll hear the song and trash it, I don't really give a fuck what they say
As a rapper you really ain't supposed to act like you in love
Fuck 'em they don't even gotta hit play
Fuck touring, fuck music, fuck money, fuck the internet, and anything that gets in the way
Even her friends and family members' opinions don't matter
Cause it's only me and you at the end of the day, and just know that:

I'll run through flames to rescue you
There's nothing I would rather do
Than be next to you

Cause I'm gon' be your knight in shining armor
And everything will be okay
Together we gon' fight through all your problems
Until they all go away
Cause I'm gon' be your knight in shining armor
And everything will be okay
And you can find me right beside my woman
She's the one, she's my soulmate",https://genius.com/Rittz-kisa-lyrics
No Friends,White Jesus,2011.0,"No! No! No! No! No! No! No!
I ain't got no friends
Shit, I ain't fuckin' with them
I'm even havin' trouble trustin' kin
Man, I ain't got no friends
Shit, I don't spot no tens
Hang around when you got no ends
I ain't got no friends
Mothafuckas sayin' we been tight
But there they go hatin' again
I ain't got no friends

I'm a loner
Feel like everything changed when ya grown up
Seem like everyone I know from the motherfucker past life
Act like they don't wanna show love
Homie hold up
See me progress, wanna see me slow up
Got a show but they don't never show up
Guaranteed if I ever were to see a little dough
They gon' be right there when I blow up
Ridin' my coat tails, suckin' me dry
Bringin' me down with all the negative vibes
Sometimes I be thinkin' they wish I wasn't alive
And now I see it, no more, I ain't lettin' it slide
Same motherfucker that you thought was down
He tried to fuck your bitch when you not around
And he knows you love her
Knows you suffer with a broken heart
But still hopes to fuck her
Tryna joke and clown on you behind your back
Tryna hide the fact it feel good to tempt
Resentin' you for every cent you make
But wanna stay down with you till your ends are spent
So who can I trust? Can I trust my girl?
She won't ease of the leash a bit
She don't want me to succeed
So scared of cheatin' she'd rather me be a piece of shit
So she argue with me till my energy gone
Sick of never gettin' along with her
She gettin' on my nerves
Thinkin' all women are dumb
I'd probably kill myself if someone give me a gun
I'm cuttin' my ties with everybody that corruptin' my life
Don't even try to look me up in the eye
Pull your knife and shove it inside my back
I better rap at these motherfuckers despises
I ain't got no friends

No! No! No! No! No! No! No!

Homeboys that I grew up with
Start switchin' on me, bitchin' 'bout this music shit
They say I'm all about the movement Rittz
Then they take my kindness and confuse it with a weakness
I guess they wish they could fit the shoes I'm in
But they can't stand to see me in the spotlight
Sayin' Rittz done changed
He don't ever say our name on the stage goddamnit
I wish I could rhyme like him
I been tryna rap before for
Fifteen years and I still ain't got shit to show for
All my hard work and so forth
But I always figured I would have my homeboys up in my corner
But they been gone and talkin' shit behind my back when the doors are closed
Actin' like they deserve a little cheese just to wear my T-shirt and go to shows
If they were smart they would play their part but they're not
There so envious, I feel the tension just
Buildin' and I'm feelin'
Like it's time to separate the friendship from the business and
Mothafuckas only come around me hopin' they can benefit
Dick ridin' everyone I introduce them to
Like ""Fuck Rittz, I do music too""
Embarassin' me when they look and I'm like ""Who is you?""
I got a new motto ""I ain't got no friends""
You ain't write a record for me
I don't owe you a dime
Either roll with us or we'll leave you behind
I don't really want the negativity on my mind
I'm finally cuttin' my ties with everybody that corruptin' my life
Don't even try to look me up in the eye
Just pull your knife and shove it inside my back

I got you nigga, word is bond
I need you nigga, pick up the phone
He let me down, let me pick up the tone 
Don't he fuck with 
Didn't Wolf get signed to Interscope right?
What they talking 'bout, 
Yep the same amount of minutes
You got to get on before you die

Used to act like you don't know me guy
'Cause you smell a nigga about the chain
Look who's on my ding-a-ling
Guess who needs some bigger jeans
Guess who said I wasn't go blow
The same mothafuckas I left
I signed and smell the mothafuckin' gold
I am a mothafuckin' ho if I
Fuck with a nigga that ain't my kind
My water is 'sposed to be my 
I hung a nigga out to dry
Tossed me in like a poker hand

Flyin' up to them with them things like shit
Cooked up yellow dope that looked like piss
Everybody used to come buy his shit
One come out, one go in, fucked me up

My Window,Top of the Line,2016.0,"Fake smile on my face, feeling suicidal, safety off of my gun
Can't tell it was real or a cry for help but I feel like if I don't make one
I'ma follow through, my girl gonna follow suit cause she tries every time I'm gone
Last tour, she done slit her wrists and this time she done OD'd, blacked out, and broke her arm
Feel bad, lyin' to her bout the coke I done
The doc said if I keep drinking Coke and Crown, I won't make it to see 38
Then I'm wasted again on the floor in the hotel room
With puke stains on the drapes and the carpet
Gotta call at eight o'clock in the morning
Said my boy took the keys to my car and drove it through the front door of an Exxon and
Cops came and, locked him up, they said they had a warrant
Now I'm spending all my tour money on his lawyer
Lord if, this is you sending us a warning
I hear it loud and clear and please God I swear
I won't ignore it anymore
This type of torment is torture, but show us a way
On my knees and I'm screaming to God and I heard him say

He told me when it rains it pours
And I can hear the pouring rain
It feels just like a hurricane just came right outside my window
Woah-oh
But one day when the rain is gone
The thunder from the storm rolls on
I woke up and I seen the sun and it shine right inside my window
And it feels like
Euphoria

Some kid just sent a DM to me
And told me everything I rap about
Feel like it happened to him identically
That he was listening to Misery Loves Company
And Wishin, Rittz I feel just like you
Im tryna rap and I'm flunkin' school
The only thing I really care about in this world
Is my girl and she been fucking with another dude
And I was hoping maybe you would tell me what to do
I'm tryna make it with the scraps that I have
Working fast for the stack of some cash
But its like I'm losing the enthusiasm I have
Trying to master the craft as a rapper
All I hear is laughter just got in a scrap with my dad
He hit me in the eye and he blackened it bad
All I ever wanted from him was a pat on the back
And I bet if I was dead he'd be glad
Hit him back so relax, this how life works
When you feel like you sitting at the bottom; You not
To get better, shit gets worse first
Gotta reverse the negative vibe
Keep praying to God. I don't believe in a made up curse
Told him that I prayed to the Lord
And he said these words

He told me when it rains it pours
And I can hear the pouring rain
It feels just like a hurricane just came right outside my window
Woah-oh
But one day when the rain is gone
The thunder from the storm rolls on
I woke up and I seen the sun and it shine right inside my window
And it feels like
Euphoria

Euphoria
We keep pourin' up
A big enormous cup
Of Crown Royal
Puff another joint and trust
You’re gonna hoist me up
When the devil wanna stick a
Pitchfork in us
Or wanna burn us in a furnace till we boil up
Beggin' The Lord above
To show remorse for us
We was born in a metamorphosis
Formed in something far less unfortunate
We absorbed enough pain to push the rush
Through our veins like a sting from a scorpion
We ashamed ‘cause we can’t afford the stuff
We wanna buy hard to find some form of love
Or find a formula, of course sure enough
You in a rut now
Layin’ on the floor in cuffs
They say the storm is comin'
But the lightning shoulda never fucked with us
'Cause they told me –

He told me when it rains it pours
And I can hear the pouring rain
It feels just like a hurricane just came right outside my window
Woah-oh
But one day when the rain is gone
The thunder from the storm rolls on
I woke up and I seen the sun and it shine right inside my window
And it feels like

Drift Away,The Life and Times of Jonny Valiant,2013,"My dodge charger like a starship
Smokin' and I'm floatin' like I'm on a magic carpet
Eat a xany bar and I chase it with captain Morgan
I hit the night life, so I can see what's on the market
See me tippin' out the darkness, lookin' sharp
It's a feature when the speakers like so much I play the organ
Take 'em to church, give 'em the works, with every verse
I spit I put my heart in and my hand is like a shark's fit
I'm bad like a white LL, homie, I'm I-L-L
I put some purple off inside my L
I wish that you could see how high I feel
You wanna drink, you got the right idea
So here's to another lifetime, cheers
Hundred dollar bills will help me dry my tears
Sayonara, see you later haters, bye-bye fear
I ain't switched and went Hollywood homie I'm right here
Without y'all or nothin', got the latest fillet
Maybe it's the taste of music and the way we was raised
Or the fact that we was trappin' found a way to escape
Through rap music, and thats beautiful ain't it today
I woke up and saw the sun sky high like it's g mo b
Prayin' everyday to G.O.D
Thankin' him for every single thing I G.O.T
Now follow me and we can all go to the T.O.P

I said, come with me, we can drift away
Some-sometimes life can be in disarray
So anyone who wanna come participate
We can all get high together, we can drift away
I said, come with me we can drift away
Sometimes life can be in disarray
So anyone who wanna come participate
We can all get high together, we can drift away
Now let's go, oh-oh-oh-oh
Roll it up, let's go, oh-oh-oh-oh
(Reverse Talk)

We could be on top of the world like 8 ball and MJG, shit
Seemed way more simple in them days
I try to restore the feelin' by chiefing some weed
My speakers beating like a drummer when they playing the djembe
Scarface, Outkast, Biggie and Eminem was my Sensei
I listened and I polished my skills, for years
I steal the will to make it up hills and valleys
And now it's finally time for me to make an imprint date
Ready? I hope I'm ready too I'm sick of being hypothetical
When talkin' 'bout makin' it, it's pathetic shit
I'm 32 the years in the struggle is unforgettable
You got a dream, I hope you live to see it comin' true
Feelin' like I was unconscious finally comin' to
Either that or the negativity's out of view
Looking at living now from a different altitude
It's shocking this positivity shit is powerful
High as fuck, head in the clouds I'm sittin' powder blue
And it great no more and the same goes for
My future finally lookin' brighter and ain't it great homeboy
Me and my homies gettin' paper like a Staples store
Woke up this morning saw the sun sky high like it's g mo b

Explode,Next To Nothing,2014.0,"You sleepin' on me then that's your loss
The shit I hear you listening to the type of music that I’m bored of
Some of you dumber than a door knob
""Blowjob Betty"" I’ll be in my super sport bumping short dog
Old-school even if I could afford a sports car
Funny all the sudden it’s popular to support us
Riding cross the country in my tour bus
Throwing up the north still reppin Lawrenceville and Norcross
Lilburn, still burn, still on that pure soft
Pop a pill when I feel like it wore off
Cli-N-Tel, we don’t chill with these morons
Strapped but my steel is concealed from the warthogs
Paint a visual got the skill of a Warhol
Signed a record deal pop the cork off of some champagne
With my lady she was down when I was broke so I would never go and leave her for a stripper or a porn star
Fuck a judge and his scorecard
Your magazine don’t cover me your company been doing a poor job
I’ve been going hard in Atlanta since the 90s motherfucker now you finally want to try to get on board nah
I don’t got no friends only checks to get
See my crew riding from Cheshire Bridge to Breckenridge
Perfected this so they’re expecting nothing less but excellence what you expected bitch

The spotlight is on me I'm ready to go for the gold
I've waited my life for this moment I'm 'bout to explode
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh 
I've waited my life for this moment I'm 'bout to explode
My goal is so close I'm focused
This Journey's been like a roller coaster of broken roads
Back when I was broke and hopeless
And hoes would look at me like I was gross, repulsive
Now they’re showing up the shows with posters
Posing naked and posting pictures, it got me mixed with emotions
Write about the past, try to live in the moment
Same past where the happiness was the missing component
(I’m) bout to murder competition opponents are Foes get exposed
They talking shit I’ll dispose them
Find the king of the throne throwing stones at his army
The Holy Ghost inside me I’m feeling so explosive
Listen to my flow and under go hypnosis
Snakes crawling all around me seeing boahs, cobras
People acting like theyre gangsters the Stallone's Travolta’s
Both impose a threat to me but I believe in destiny and God has been directing me, the road is chosen
Weight of the world on my shoulder with scoliosis
(but I’m) electrifying like a jolt of voltage
Diamonds on my necklace shinin like a bowl of goldfish
Ain't no time to rest cause I know I got dough to go get
Sick of penny pinching like I’m trying to hold some roach clips
Busted through the wall I was poking holes in
I was meant to be the centerpiece I’m sick of playing second base to anyone

Living A Dream,Next To Nothing,2014.0,"Damn shawty
Got damn living it up ain't you
All that designer shit man
You know what I mean
Got damn you living a dream bruh

My shades more expensive than your J's
My chain indicates that I'm paid
My lady say it's time to get engaged
She say I go on tour and misbehave
Our bills are never late
On the stage rocking like I'm Jimmy Page
But fuck swag, I ain't dressing up like Kid 'n Play
Trying to snap on every track like Eminem on Renegade
If you ain't heard of me then you been living in a cave
Or sitting in a grave, or listening to Drake
Any minute the shit will disintegrate
This music business is fishy like penetrating a bitch who didn't bathe
Wanted on the streets like I went to prison and escaped
Fuck the police, these authority figures get disobeyed
In the broad day bullets be grazing and ricochet
No games, only participating in pistol play
Im rappin I should be cracking  inside of a crème brûlée
It's like I'm pinned against a cage, fightin' in the MMA
Bitch

It is what it is but it ain't what it seems
People thinking that I'm living a dream
Ohhh ohhh yeahh yeahh
When I roll through in my old school Cut' Supreme
They be thinking that I'm living a dream
Ohhh ohhh yeahhhhh

Yeah
My older brother's a teacher, one of his students asked
If I ever game him money, it's funny, people think I got stupid cash
If they only knew the half
Hoping I got loot to last me to June and it's April
Afraid to go and do the math
Covering my emotions, hope they don't see through the mask
From the outside looking in it's different, looking through the glass
Me and Tech ain't Bernz and Wrek, me and Wolf ain't Snoop and Daz
Cause the truth is that this music crap is difficult to grasp
That's why you never see me go on interviews and bash
Other rappers, I'm not the dude booin' while you at bat
Cause I still got a pill problem
My dollar bills still got a film on 'em
Feeling like some loser trash
Responding to Twitter mentions, groupies getting too attached
Homies clueless asking questions, ""When they sending you a plaque?""
Explaining how budgets work, recouping and how I'm stressing
Cause I never see a check from selling 50,000 records
But


Yeah
I'm sick of people speaking for me like ain't a day I was stressing
Why the fuck I'm living life somewhere lost in a thousand questions
Every blessing got me grateful but these haters got me hateful
So I take it 'til I'm permanent resting, but they don't see that
All they see is that I'm a trip
Fuck 'em, I'd rather kick it and dive inside they woman' lips
Yeah this whip I ride is nice but why you worried 'bout the price
What about they days I walk and hustle just to starve for nights
And that's for real
Why are they acting like they was on side of me
They don't remember when everyone lied to me
Left me alone and that was cool back then
But now that they looking they acting like they was the one that was doing it
Telling me they was my people
They thought they had me fooled back then
Not Trae, no not today, I'm living for me
No opinion got me in shackles, shit I'm living life free
And everything seem to be a dream, I tried to tell 'em wake up
But instead they'd rather hate me getting cake up

Started raping the rap game; I was sick of molestin' it
Give me 
Crown
 and 
some Pepsi, a zanny bar and Mescaline
Have an Adderall dissolvin' on my tongue like a peppermint, shit...
What you still on the fence? You still not convinced?
I'm next, what you feel like I'm too real for the trend?
Don't resent me when you see me with the tints on the Benz
You gotta sit on the bench, you smellin' sin and some scents, you jealous?
I ain't stoppin' 'til I'm hot as Adele is and you can try to derail us
We change the jealousy just try to compel us
We relish any Clintel, this a mafia, wanna challenge us?

You should take notes, in the booth it's cake; it's nothin'
Study me and watch as I illuminate
Cockroaches, I got no choice, I gotta fumigate
Accumulatin' dollars daily, how much money you done made-
Off rappin'? They got the nerve to call me ugly, I'm offended

Poke her like a cattle prod, fuck her standin' up

Ghost Story,Top of the Line,2016.0,"Welcome to the Jonny Valiant show
I'm about to blow
Independent with a hundred thousand albums sold
Rappers used to crowd around me, funny now they don't
No one's in my lane, my competition going adiós
No magician but I dissipate 'em in a cloud of smoke
Revvin' they engine up and I'm a thousand miles down the road
You ain't ever heard of me, fuck it now you know
It's hard to take you serious and I ain't out of jokes
Most of the shit you rap about is unaccountable
Saying nothing, making noise with your mouth like Al Jarreau
Never seen an ounce of blow, flexin' like you Al Capone
Sink your teeth and we can seek a sweet like brownie à la mode
Pocket full of bread, I ain't counting sourdough
Shittin' on 'em from above, funny how the roles
Got reversed, when it was him, they never said ""Look out below""
Never tried to lend a hand, I was down and out and broke
With no balance in my bank account and just a couple 'O's
Now we feastin' beef medallions while we toastin' Crown and Coke
Cheers. Weird. Where'd the talent go? Now it's like there's no one left
Someone said you blowing up, they trolling on the social net-
-Work. I murk my foes, I choke 'em out and never broke a sweat
You knock one out the box, now watch it cause a domino effect
And I’m a monster so these ghosts and goblins don’t impose a threat
I ain't scared of no one, seen a hater and I told him that

If you don't start shit, there won't be none
'Cause I don't really need no reason
To be the one responsible for your extinction
'Cause when it comes to competition, I don't see none
They all went ghost on me
Ain't nobody coming close to me
It's like a goddamn ghost story
It's a goddamn ghost story
It's a goddamn ghost story

Go ahead and sound the horn, like every boring rapper does
I wish the dude behind the booth would pull the power cord
Just quit and do some shit you're good at
Your stage show is hard for me to look at
Like the unibrow on Al B. Sure!
The difference between our music's night and day
I'm getting busy but you shitty like a giant pile of cow manure
So watch that mouth of yours
I never thought I'd see the day it'd be okay to let these rappers dress like Shalamar
They wanna dance, suck a dick, fuck these kids, knock 'em off they balance boards
Beat 'em down and settle out at court
Ugly as fuck but these sluts pulling down they drawers
White bitches love me like an Abercrombie outfit stores
Sick and never found the cure, sipping on the Crown I poured
Wild and rowdy, bumping Scotty ATL and Alley Boy
Some dummy said I wasn't hungry since I made it and I'm famous
Bitch, I'm starving like the Army was in Valley Forge
Was dope enough to get a deal back in 2004
I was born a killer, tried to warn 'em, better tell the boys

If you don't start shit, there won't be none
'Cause I don't really need no reason
To be the one responsible for your extinction
'Cause when it comes to competition, I don't see none
They all went ghost on me
Ain't nobody coming close to me
It's like a goddamn ghost story
It's a goddamn ghost story
It's a goddamn ghost story

I'm just really being honest y'all
I'm just sick of being modest all the time
When all these artists talk like they the hottest and y'all
They don't get away with murder
They just rhyming words together, ain't no substance to their monologue
They go on stage and spray the crowd with water
Rapping over top they vocals to distract
The fact, they sounding awful dog
We ain't playing volleyball, I ain't going back and forth
If you diss me and then piss me off, then I might smack you for it
Run up in the studio while you were on like everything
It's coolio, I jack you for your laptop and your Mac keyboard
You think I'm playing? You mistaken
Shit, you faker than the movie Taken
You ain't got no skills, you only act the part
Come and get a battle scar, thicker shit that's caviar
You fictional like Battlestar Galactica and Avatar
I'm on another planet then these rappers I'm on Saturn, Mars
Venus, Jesus, we the C-N-T and we just laugh at y'all
An open casket, I just killed a Kato track
If you feel it, play it back
Really, I'm just stating facts that

If you don't start shit, there won't be none
Cause I don't really need no reason
To be the one responsible for your extinction
Cause when it comes to competition, I don't see none
They all went ghost on me
Ain't nobody coming close to me

Down for Mine,Last Call,2017.0,"They should know by now, when I rap I got a reputation
Causin' devastation, I get down for mine
See Tech N9ne fucked around and signed
An individual that's visibly out his mind
It's hard to count the times, how many rappers I've
Massacred, Al Capone,  and every day is St. Valentine's
It's Jonny Valiant, I'm the first thing that comes to mind
When you hit the Gwinnett County line
I'm on powder and Crown combined
I like to mix the uppers with the liquor then I switch up
Poppin' the Klonopins, I got me a prescription
Watch out for the rappers tryna plot another stick up
Reminisce the kids in my clique that ain't with us anymore
They ain't live to see past twenty
Tryna see fast money, got they ditch dug early
So no wonder why it's hard to be religious
White boy shit, we ain't hoppin' in a pickup
They depict us to be redneck
Let my bread stack till I'm in a Benz truck, limo tint
Gotta wipe a pimp down with a lint brush
Oh-ee, Louie
Symbol on my shoe, blew two Gs, too clean
Groupies turning up, they wanna fuck
And turn the bus into a nude scene, that's routine
Fuck the YouTube views and your newsfeed
'Cause your whole style is whack
You getting clout nowadays when you sound exactly like another man
I ain't tryna vouch for that
Used to wear button-downs and slacks but now you trap
You strapped but you swear that you down to clash
'Cause mumble rap's in style you be trying hard to sound relaxed
You take words and pronounce them bad
To sound like you have an accent, really that's it?
I never thought I'd use the word ""flabbergasted""
It's an exact fit to explain my reaction, like I'm yackin' in a trash bin
I don't use a bunch of ad-libs to distract fans
I combine the real with the metaphors and bars
From the wheel struggling to get a deal
Through the valley in the hills
Like you tryna win the Tour de France
You can't tell me I don't kill shit
Turn me up with the Coupé de Ville feel with a foreign car
Been ten years and I'm still lit
Now my Colorado homies, and it's twenty past four o'clock
It's last call but I got another quart to pop
And I ain't ever wore a cap and gown
But got mass amounts of cash to count
I'm rapping now for spazzing out
So tell 'em when they ask around

I get down
Down for mine, down for mine
I get down
Down for mine, down for mine
I get down
Down for mine, get down for mine
I told 'em I don't fuck around about a thousand times
I show out and shine with no doubt in mind
I get down
Down for mine, down for mine
I get down
Down for mine, down for mine
I get down
Down for mine, get down for mine
I told 'em I don't fuck around about a thousand times
I show out and shine with no doubt in mind
I get down

That's truth that you can't dispute
It's CNT in this bitch, what a man'll do
Dick Tracy, attention to
I'd be the same ol' me if I wore tight pants and boots
Is that a diss? Incorrect, get an 'X' like (
buzzer
)
Ain't no family feud, the seed planted bloomed
We hit Atlanta, flew to France and landed Coco Vance and broke madams and pampered dudes
Them ugly motherfuckers smiling for the camera crew
I'm getting bands of loot, the broke shit discussion
'Cause I finally got a check, we can stretch out money
Maybe you were meant to be a fitness instructor
Witness destruction when I represent for the misfits amongst us
The old heads, kids, and youngsters
Fuck with me you'll be stuck on me
Like you had unsafe sex with an ex of Usher's
Is you a bald bitch? What you need a hairpiece? Got the herpes?
Sue me, I'ma throw you down the staircase
You try to tell me that I broke too many barricades
That's why you never hear my music on the airwaves
I drop a nuke on every record, that's an air raid
Pull your hair weave, bitch suck and bob
I need to find a chick kinda like Blac Chyna
To give me all the checks she collect from Rob
You never see 'em interview me on The Breakfast Club
But they know me in New Zealand and Czech Repub
Up in Cleveland and Lincoln, Nebraska, Reno, Nevada
Alaska has extra love
Mic check like Tech, I'm a regular
You saw 
All Eyez on Me
, thought you was 2Pac
But you a Little Richard homie wop-bop-a-loo-bop
You shocked that I blew up?
I thought that you knew

I get down
Down for mine, down for mine
I get down
Down for mine, down for mine
I get down
Down for mine, get down for mine
I told 'em I don't fuck around about a thousand times
I show out and shine with no doubt in mind
I get down
Down for mine, down for mine

Until We Meet Again,Top of the Line,2016.0,"Another school shooting just occurred today
Thinking what on earth
Could make somebody run up in a school or a church
And take innocent lives away based on a person's race
Little school kids stripped of their vertebrae's
Fake rumors start to circulate
They beat his ass on camera, cause they heard he's gay
The YouTube views almost over 30k
The internet got us so shallow that we impersonate
Celebs' thinking that we all should be one
And not that we failed
The world, they need male role models
Wish you knew your pops but he's gone
And mom don't keep up, she got two jobs
Don't like stress, working for her children
She's at work while her teenage daughter
In the room with a dude and she twerking while he filming
Hurt somebody's feelings
Shit all we do online is diss and talk bad, and we bash
Total strangers
Hope's endangered
Glad to see my homie's made it back from Iraq
But his limbs are torn up, his friends got blown up
Enlisted as a kid, ever since, they grown up
They been through so much, disposed to death in combat
How the fuck you come back and adapt?
My homie just got Hodgkin's Lymphoma
I'm praying every day hoping he gonna beat it
Strong motherfucker on the phone with me
Telling me jokes while he's going through his chemo treatment
And he didn't put one sob story on his timeline
Instagram or Facebook ain't always real life
People staring at their phones so much that they forget to look up and see the skyline
Thinking that they Einstein cause they wrote a clever post
It's  Just a flash in a tiny attention span
Music is chewed up like fast food and spewed out
Like ""I'm new with a menu plan""
I can't hear shit..
Sincerety clearly has died
My lyrics are merely mirrors to the tears in my eyes

I’ve done my best to share my life
My privacy's been sacrificed
But now we've reached the end
Until we meet again
I've put my soul in every word
I've shared my pain until it hurts
But now we've reached the end
Until we meet again
Ah yeah

Woke up and I checked Worldstar this morning
A cop just shot and killed a black kid
It was all recorded
Just like the incident they put up two days before it
It's become so normal that it sickens me
I know that I'm probably going to piss some people off listening
Because I'm white and I'm talking about some shit we generally don't go through
But still I can't ignore it
There's so many people with power that won't go forward
The problem ain't gonna solve itself
Half of the cases are unreported until it's caught on someone's cell
And this is not a diss to all law enforcement
We call on them to help out when there is a threat
But I guess it's because I'm white, if I was black I'd be scared to death
When David Banner asked us
""Where were all the white rappers at when Mike Brown got gunned down?""
I couldn't think of any answers
I felt ashamed and afraid of the future
With no contribution or any helping hand to lend
I went to Kansas City
Shooting videos for my last album
And I could feel the tension
Another time of my life that I felt I was guilty for the color of my skin tone
Three months later, I was back in Missouri
On tour the same night that the verdict was read
I was in shock, on Twitter venting
Then one of my fans tweeted that Mike Brown deserved it
I said, ""Man, you dumb as fuck
Imagine you went to the store for blunts
And tried to run out the door with a pack
And the cops didn't bother arresting you
Or give you a lecture
But instead they just murdered you dead, man this shit ain't right!""

I’ve done my best to share my life
My privacy's been sacrificed
But now we've reached the end
Until we meet again
I've put my soul in every word
I've shared my pain until it hurts
But now we've reached the end
Until we meet again
Ah yeah..

Try to stand out around me gonna need to have a shaved mohawk with the rainbow dot
And some baseball socks and a pink bow tie, drip drip drippin' like a paintball shot
Diamonds on my neck piece, dance in sanction, the clasp still latch but the chain went POP!
Fuck a Lady Ga, Jonas brothers
Fuck the rap game raw, don't wear rubbers
Don't care what is considered in style now
Lookin' like you in and out of homeless shelters
And I'm on time, Jonny Amazon Prime
Like a fat bitch cannonball dive
And it made waves in a pool, wishin' I'd drown
Fuck you and the rappers you consider top five
'Cause they name's not mine, that's fine in time
I become your favorite, underrated one you hated
'Cause you made a sudden change and gave it a listen, now I'm always on your playlist
You ain't armed and dangerous, we ain't scared at all
Little homie you ain't savage, save it
Shouldn't even be allowed for you to wear Savage

Pour chlorox and the floor pops, I'm sorry I fucked up the carpet

MWA, motherfuckers in old Box Chevies bumpin' me
Sippin' on creekwater
With a rolled up christmas tree in a sunken sea
In the gutter where the junkies be
Me and my mother got fuckin' peeved
Married to the system yeah, give the devil his custody
That's a hot pink pentagram, I'm Catfish Billy, bitch
Took the sun of God and a lightning rod to awaken my crip
Slumerican red, for the walkin' dead with a buckshot in my script
'Til the clock no longer ticks, tick, tick, tick, ugh
Ghetto cowboy, ridin' down 
Pull up on the block with the fuckin' lawn mower
Choppin' blades, moppin' toys, made a boss, not employed
Drippin' sauce, attaboy, look at him rob? Not annoyed

When you checkin’ out the subject and the predicate
Etiquette of a nigga, better get out of my way
I’m a veteran, you can never get ahead of it
Let him inside of my cage, I kill ‘em, I’m an elephant
I’m better than whoever they wanna be makin’ a mockery of
In order for me to let you live, it gotta be love
Shotgun protectin’ me ‘cause I be fillin’ the vacancy
Of a cemetery with the many bodies in blood
Like Kato, must chop, big rocks on the fingers like Thanos
And if you ask who wanna get it with the T
I bet you seein’ a room full of niggas you couldn’t say most
I got a life you could put up inside of a book
And when I ride I’mma come with the style of a crook
You ain’t gon’ never be able to get one of these
And the way I spit it be leavin’ ‘em niggas shook
The story is gory, orientated around victorious wars
I made it into another reality
Instead of the horror that waited inside of the mind of a shorty
Invaded with another kinda perception of life
I came out of it and I’m attackin’ the rhythm with a vengeance
Smackin’ ‘em with every sentence
I’m on a pedestal and it’s inevitable, I be the bidness
When you checkin’ out the style, it’s wild, it’s brolic
Listen to the pound, its sound is sonic
When you hear me say nobody comin’ this hard
You ain’t knowin’ nobody that been around this honest
Look at Twist, he the shit
Kill an enemy dead with what he kick knowin’ they must fall
Look at Rittz when he spit
Spill an enemy guts like grits, it’s a wake up call

Nostalgia,Top of the Line,2016.0,"First time I ever set eyes on you it was love at first sight
You was so young, your mom told me that she got a son, and you were the love of her life
As time went on, me and you bonded
I fathered you, I was so proud to be a dad
We were so broke, I promised you that one day I would get rid of the problems we had
I hope you accept my apology
All the fights and the drunk nights that you saw in the past
You never chose sides, we were so sad
But when it came to happiness you're all we really had, you're an angel
So happy-go-lucky, such a good soul, words can't express
You had a gift of making people fall in love with you
You affected every single person you met
And we ain't have much, we spoiled you to death
Anything you wanted you can have, I still laugh
Think about the holiday when you snuck and ate a whole cheesecake we ain't even get mad, that's your favorite
We was so stressed out, we were about to lose the house that we stayed in
I was trying to be a rapper, we could've moved in my parents basement but couldn't bring you
Really you're the one that made me quit trying to rap, so I went and got a job so that we could get a house, I'd do anything for you
You, me, and your mom moved with your grandma
It was us three stuck in a little room
Finally had a place to play outside, I would love to see you run, like a dream coming true
I was riding in my car to some tracks one day, played this beat, started thinking of you and now I'm...

Looking in my rear view
Wishing I was near you
It's quiet here without ya
And I've been thinking about ya
Feeling of nostalgia

I hated my job, I loved coming home
I would lay in bed with you for hours on end
Me and your mom were obsessed with you
Cause you were momma's baby boy, and daddy's best friend
But daddy ain't been, home a lot lately
To play with, I tried to set you down and explain
That I got a new job, that I wanted all my life, and that everything might possibly change
That I'ma have to go out of town for some months but when I'm home, I'ma be around every day
And when I'm gone I'ma need you to look out for your mom, keep her company while daddy's away
Your momma sends pics of you and her in bed
I would feel bad thinking that you thought I left
But I was saving bread so we could finally have our own place, live a life that we should've always had
And I did that
Now you're spoiled even more cause instead of being cramped now you got your own room
Your mom quit her job, and you and her could chill every day
For the most part, I'd be home too
And life is looking bright, used to see it so blue
We finally were content, had a daily routine
I made a bunch of songs with your name in them
I would come into your room, hugging you and I would sing
You were always treated like a king
Cause you were everything that mattered to us and I would hate to see your cute face - crying
Cause you knew that I was leaving for a tour
Always hated when I go and grab that red suitcase out the closet
You'd look at me and say you promise, you stayed by your mom when I'm gone
I'll be back in a couple of months, give me kisses I'll be missing you a ton
Homesick every time I'm...

Looking in my rear view
Wishing I was near you
It's quiet here without ya
And I've been thinking about ya
Feeling of nostalgia

You grew up so fast, but you always had a baby face so it's hard for me to tell
You were sick on and off
We were just rough-housing on the bed, good to see you getting well
I had to go to Omaha for a show, but your mom called me up and told me that you slipped and fell
But you were limping, we figured that you twisted something and had to give it time to tell
I got home and you were breathing funny and your hip was big as hell
Your momma said that she began to see it swell
This morning, this isn't normal, we took him to the doctor, we thought he might of broke his hip bone and it would heal
It's crazy how life change in an instant
The doctor walked in with his x-rays
Said he thought he broke his hip, but he didn't
He got bad news and there ain't no way to fix it, what is it?
He said the x-rays showed bone cancer was spreading through his legs in a crazy position
The amputation, the chemo, wasn't a option
He probably ain't gon make it to Christmas, I blacked out
Cause Christmas is like three weeks away
When I left he was okay, now your telling me he's gonna die?
He said he's strong so he's gonna fight
Eventually you're gonna have to put him down whenever y'all decide
Please God, not a dog, we're in shock, not our son, he's the only thing we got, we was done
It'd be different if we knew that he was suffering for months, but he's limping, how the fuck is it that nothing can be done?
Tried to comfort him as much as we could
Drug his mattress - down the stairs to the center of the living room
Me and his mom laid with him every night
Petting him while he was crying, you could tell the pain was getting to him
And me and her in disbelief, all we did was cry, all we did was scream
Struggling to try, we'd take him outside, but he could barely walk
And every day it seems, it's spreading even more
The medicine we fed him isn't doing anything and we just can't accept it that our boy
The most important thing is dying right in front of us
Like how much do we let him suffer til we go and make the choice
We were laying on the floor almost twenty days
He ain't eating anymore, he can't move his legs
It's December 21st, I think it's time for us to let him go so we can send him to a better place
It's been several weeks, me and your mom still grieving feeling like we in denial
I go in your bedroom every day, smell the air
Start to cry for a while, then I smile thinking bout ya...

Looking in my rear view
Wishing I was near you
We're crying here without ya
We're dying here without ya

Wish You Could,Next To Nothing,2014.0,"North side shit, you can find me out on beaver ruin
Up inside a Cutlass or a Buick
Instead of hating on it just salute it
Don’t be sad my car looks better than the one that I see you in
The police pulled me over, I was cooling
Tried to say that I was under the influence
Well I was on the brew and on a pill
Said I got a script, tell em I don’t distribute it
I got a plan, it’s time to execute it
Awhile ago man I was going through it
Now I’m looking like I’m MJ
Dunking on a bunch of Patrick Ewings, like you win
Your money grow, a ton of hoes be chewing
But fuck em, I ain’t into rescuing, but you can
I’m smoking on that Cali when I flew in
But it 770 you know I’m bout to go tattoo it
My crew be kicking it on Steve Reynolds road
You wanna holler, meet me at the Dollar General
I’m with a Slum bitch by the name of Indigo
She known to twerk it like she working on the stripper pole
A playmate, face, body like a centerfold
I get her hooked, leave her squirming on my fishing pole
I get a stack of Benjamins up in a envelope
It’s time to let em know it’s 7-7-0, cause I...

Started in the A, now it’s nation wide
All around the world I be getting love
Look at how I do it, I ain’t got to try
So fly, man it’s in my blood
And I’m sitting straight
I’m living good
Want to hate on me, I wish you would
I’m sitting straight
I’m living good
Getting money that you wish that you could
I put my foot in a brand new pair of Js
Everywhere we go, people stare at us
I was born to be a star, I ain’t got to try
I’m so fly, man it’s in my blood
And I’m sitting straight
I’m living good
Want to hate on me, I wish you would
I’m sitting straight
I’m living good
Getting money that you wish that you could

You know I party every day like it’s the weekend
We was getting drunk at 3pm
Eyes leaning like I’m a Korean
Drinking Jameson, has got me feeling European
These bitches showing titties on my DM
Chiefing Colorado in my G-Pen
Haters, they don’t really want no beef, nah
Heaters turn a hater to a vegan, now beat it
I beat them up and leave them on the cement
Swimming in the money, stick your feet in
My tour manager that my TM
He be sending all the bitches to the lobby in the Sleep-Inn
And we ain’t even peaked, this a pre-lim'
My life is like a movie you can sneak in, so peep it
I’m leaning in my Cutlass, playing who’s that creeping in your window
In a ski mask, these motherfuckers sleeping

Cause I be representing for the north side of Atlanta
I stand out in a crowd so they start pulling out they camera
Bout to speed it up, I slow it down so there ain’t no misunderstanding
That I’m bout to blow, on that dro and that Marilyn Monroe
Arrogant, no, but it's apparent I'm dope
And they know I


Internet tripping on my new release
Killing the industry like I went on a shooting spree
My pockets finally growing up, they went through puberty
I spent a couple hundred dollars on my shoes at least
I got your boo stripping, coming out her Gucci jeans
Some ooh wee and a bottle full of booze to drink
And baby blue '82 Caprice, if you cool I'mma take it down a few degrees
And you know I",https://genius.com/Rittz-wish-you-could-lyrics
Twin Lakes,Put a Crown on It,2019.0,"I open my eyes up
There's somebody sleepin' in the bed next to mine
But I don't recognize them
Couple nurses comin' in the room to check on me
And maybe shed light
Tell me where I am
My legs are too long for this twin size bed
She said I need rest
Time to take my meds
It's gonna be a long thirty days ahead
I went for my phone
But it's gone
She said the staff searched everything I own
They confiscate my razor
My cologne
They made me sign a waiver
I can't call home
So now I'm praying to the light on the fire alarm
Thinkin' to myself ""Look what I've become""?
The tears on my face taste like alcohol
I'm crawled up in a ball
Fighting my withdrawals

I was starin' in the mirror
And the man I saw
Was appalled at the wrong I've done
And it's never been as clear as it is right now
I was powerless all life long
I'm ready for recovery
Tryin' on to break these chains
Ready for recovery
Tryin' to escape Twin Lakes

It's six AM
And I don't got an appetite for breakfast
I can't make friends
'Cause I don't think that I know who I am yet
I flick my cigarette ash, I'm scared of talkin' group
A girl across the room is sayin' how she got abused
Younger kids are laughin' like it's funny, I am not amused
I need to mind my business, that's the type of attitude I'm trying to lose
Told my counselor, I think that I fell out of love of livin'
I drink Crown by the gallon jug, not an ounce of fuck is givin'
Buzzed without the fun, now I'm just a violent drunk
And If I don't want to get sober, then it's all over
I just hope my higher power shows forgiveness
Victim of this drug abusive life I live
Lose my mind and then another suicide attempt
So I turn my willing life over to you to drive again
I'm just hopin' I got time to undo the wrong I did

I was starin' in the mirror and the man I saw
Was appalled at the wrong I've done
And it's never been as clear as it is right now
I was powerless all life long
I'm ready for recovery
Tryin' on to break these chains
Ready for recovery
Tryin' to escape Twin Lakes

It's never too late",https://genius.com/Rittz-twin-lakes-lyrics
Propane,Top of the Line,2016.0,"Ridin' in my Caddy, El Dorado on my gold things
Speakers in the trunk and they be screamin' causin' road rage
And you know that I'm too busy to be bothered, I don't answer when my phone rings
Makin' money in the music business like I'm in the dope game
Like somebody came and lit the propane
Oh bang

Riding in my Chevy Monte Carlo on them chrome things
Speakers in the trunk and they be screamin' causin' road rage (Ya-uh-ya, ya-uh yeah)
And you know that I'm too busy to be bothered
Rollin' up and blowin' smoke rings
Makin' money in the music business like I'm in the dope game

Like I'm reunited with an old flame, I'm on fire (Yeah)
Like somebody came and lit the propane, I'm on fire
Like I'm reunited with an old flame, I'm on fire (Yeah)
I'm on fire

Rittz up in this bitch, they should nickname me classic
Drivin' a classic Cadillac, I fashion it in traffic
Bout' to drop a classic album, here's a classic song to match it
Jordans on my feet, I hit the gas and then I pass 'em
Smell the weed I'm chiefin', had to crack the window, gaspin'
Cussin' out my homie 'cause he's ashin' on the missus in the back, I said you pushin' it
You almost burned a hole right through the cushions in my pillow seats, they padded like a mattress
Million dollar motive, call me Jonny Global
Funny I remember how it felt when I was local
Now we travel coast to coast, Spanish bitches holler, ""Hola""
When I'm in my Arizona home, it's candy-coated LoLo
When you ride in chrome or solid gold, you gotta showboat
In my Monte Carlo 'bout to valet park it up at Fogo
Haters they can hate but they can't take away my mojo
I took my lady home, I hit the club and rolled up solo
When I'm

Ridin' in my Chevy Monte Carlo on them chrome things

I'm Pimp Tight, M-J-G, I thought I told you serious
Not a joker, real juicy pussy poker
I-55 driver, never in a disguise, a real nigga for real
90's era survivor
Keep hoes hoein' as long as the wind blowin'
As long as her friend goin', that's how you get ten goin'
That's multiplication and communication at its best
Power and pimpin', my manipulation is a test
For all of the ones who think they are the greatest
Their popularity is sinkin' 'cause there you go again thinkin'
Now I done told y'all niggas wantin' to be the best
You gotta learn from the best 'cause we invented the rest
Yeah me and my O.G's, The Run D-M-C's
E-P-M-D's, Rakim's and Eric B.'s
The Geto Boys, the Bun B's, and the Pimp C's
You might could charge a trick but you can't charge these

I'm gone like a drone, high in the sky
I'm behind the wheel but I feel like a fly
Pulling up chromey, got some cookies on me
Continue to keep cool with cops all around me
It's hot as Tabasco, press on the gas slow
Blew at an ugly bitch, she had a whole bunch of ass though
Creepin', bendin' corners like I did in '96
One-fifty a gallon for gas, used to be higher'n a bitch
Ride all day, smoke all night
And play some funky music I hope y'all like
In the hood all good, Kenwood with the woofers
Pulling up on D-boys, thugs, pimps, and hookers
Look at D is what they say when they see me when I be coastin'
They be askin' me for weed because they know that I be smokin'
Every day, all day, nigga, 24/7
I give them a hit then split
They be like, ""Give me more, Devin""

Walter White Boy Flow,Bootleg Kev’s Empire Business,2013.0,"They say that Rittz ain’t shit, Rittz ain’t rich
But you never heard nobody say that Rittz can't spit
If you’re looking for some bullshit, this ain’t it
I just did a line of speed, 'bout to feel the drain drip
Nose on fire, throat on fire
Got my coat on, glowing, homie, no bow-tie
Drinking Crown for some more, crow boat, go find mine
Kind of like a snow globe, so coked out
Rappers copy me sloppily, oh so twat
No, adios guys - maybe I should help 'em out
I could try and ghostwrite for 'em, if it goes right
Maybe Bootleg Kev'll play it on the show, afternoon
Like on that Big Sean song, Chief on strong
Weed got me staring at a big-boned blonde
I can see above her cheeks she had a big thong on
Didn't mack, cause I could tell she need a King Kong schlong
Damn, I forgot to put it in her ass
Just to make her feel me enter it, consider it, and maybe later
I'll find an Asian chick cause her hands'll make it bigger
I'm just tripping, that's the shit I say when I be drinking liquor
Doing meth is a gift, I receive and I'm a giver
That line's dedicated to my homie Scender
My pissed-off manager can't control his temper
When he call up and act like I got a new number
Far from a newcomer, got the cue
Done an aged bitch with a cucumber then I puked on her
I'm just playing, she was 20, I'mma keep it 200
What? You hated how I look, but I finally grew on ya
Fuck you, homicide, a lot of people do, burn a soup runner
Cause I'm feeling like my stomach getting lit

Reality Check,Last Call,2017.0,"Yu-Uh-Yeah
Look
If you ain’t in my circle I ain’t got no trust in you
You a lame, using slang I ain’t accustomed to
Saying what the fuck I do
Like when a lady wake up naked in the bed
Laying next to Dr. Huxtable
What you uncomfortable? Wonderful, smoke with one apple
I hit a blunt with you then go and crush a box of Lunchable’s
A Smucker’s Uncrustables and a couple pack of Gusher’s
Bust a bag of Ruffles open, start a crackin' Dutches
Let the guts fall out, y’all can shut y'all mouth
But y'all can suck it out in public saying fuck all out
What that embarrass you?
With no comparison or similarities with me
And who is in the mirror that you stare into (That's you)
I’m pimping bitches why you scaring them like man this dude
Experimenting with ‘em let ‘em share ‘em while the cameras shoot
They need a director’s chair, you’re repping the censored ,yeah
An ode to C-N-T is deep connected like checkered square
Giuseppes and Natty’s and I just bought me a fresher pair
My guess is you would step into some Sketcher’s I’d never wear
No sense of style, I went to Fifth’s and I was in and out
With stacks of cash so massive it could be a risk to count
My pockets fat ain’t been no slimming down
Only getting fatter like a bitch done had an infant child that sits around
And you could say that I’m harsh, say my flavor is posh
I say that you ain’t getting paper, no más
You a hater and I think I know why
'Cause I be taking long vacations in locations where they say Aloha
And having luaus, a mansion with a pool house
With you down bass
Sleeping on couches that expand into a pull-out
Broke in Neiman Marcus seen him glancing at the shoe aisle
But you ain’t got no money, you just flex like you do
Your rep is questionable, in fact you’re destined to lose
You ever test me, get me deadly, that’s inevitable
You on a stretcher with a medical crew, rescuing you
'Cause I decked you I ain’t testing no new wresting move
Suplexing dude, you would look fresh with a blue vest on
Working the Crawlmart, did you check the dude’s restroom?
Get the carts from the lot? Get a carpenter job
Or lay some carpet. Ever thought of giving Arby’s a shot?
Just not rapping acting like your bars are hard when they’re not
Honest to God they couldn’t market the garbage you got

You say the shit that you’re about to regret (Motherfucker)
That’s why you never get one ounce of respect
You messed up and stepped in a pile of deep shit
I think it’s time to get your reality checked
Check one, two
Check one, two
One, Two

They say I murder shit and I just say affirmative
I just write what I observe like I’m a journalist, I'm merciless
My purpose ain’t to further your encouragement of surfacing
I heard your shit, your verses need refurbishing
But let’s be honest we done thought we heard the worst but then a trend emerges with a surge, the words just reoccur again
Is that a her or him? I work my pen so much it hurts my hand
Like when you fingering a bitch to make her squirt and can’t
Her meat curtains look like turkey skin, screaming lord have mercy like I witnessed bitches twerking at a church event
And I’ve done fucked in church before don’t judge me for it
I’m sure the lord above forgave me, maybe understood the circumstance that I was in
I was in and out of consciousness
A constant itch to put a straw up in my nostril, hit the soft and sniffed
Confidence was lost I used to say I was incompetent, but now I’m balling hanging off the rim like David Robinson
Bought my bitch exotic whips, ain’t no S&M
A lot of artists getting played, ain’t no record spin
A lot of trends are getting dated, like leopard print
For years I watched the game and waited, but sat the bench
You convinced about it like you could do it like I did
Signed a deal at thirty-two, but still doing you in the process
Maybe I made it look easy, admit it, there isn't a stake in it making it feasible, they should have taken a breather instead of believing the people they keeping around and they lie
But really I’m a good guy, and I just stood by
But this is getting silly, good try
It’s time to quit but you’re delusional as usual
So you just go and hate on me online, but I’ve been on the look out

You say the shit that you’re about to regret (Motherfucker)
That’s why you never get one ounce of respect
You messed up and stepped in a pile of deep shit

You ain't never seen an underground MC like me
Go harder, I'mma start a revolution
People talkin' shit but they don't wanna do none
Rappers wanna battle, lyrically execute them
Gruesome, stupid in the booth, going too dumb
Name hotter than the sun is over Tucson
People sayin ""where the fuck dude from?""
Come and look, got 'em stuck, like I shot 'em with a glue gun
White Ice Cube stompin' with some black boots on
Got your girlfriend drinkin' on some Boone's Farm
Send her back to you drunk
You don't wanna kiss her 'cause I came inside her mouth
Now get the fuck up off the futon
On the paper route, I betta get a move on
If I ever wanna register with DuPron
To get the coupe with the roof gone
Tryna stack dough like a crew, son, pocket fulla croutons
Who got dope and on stupid purp
Will Power said here's a super hot beat you could merk
I'mma treat her like a loud mouth bitch
When I spit it's like I'm physically abusing her
White Jesus, I'm Lucifer
Toebiz cool shoes, then you don't wanna shoot the bird
I'll tell a wack rapper too berserk
Maybe they can study how to execute the verse
'Cause my pen may 'cause your balloon to burst
Don't nobody give a shit 'bout who ya worth
'Cause I can move the Earth and use the words I'm finally here

I'm too for sure that these stars align, and this year is mine
Doin' a line of clear when they hear me rhyme 'cause I'm

Goin' crazy, too berserk, so high now I'm nuclear
Outta this world, I'm Jupiter, flow so tubular
And I'm smokin' crazy, stupid herb

Hops out the Cadillac hearse but you're finally here

To go crazy, too berserk, crazy, nuclear, crazy
I'm finally here, I came back from the future first

I'm an OG dog, when y'all was in the classroom
I was on the beats
I was gettin' geeked up, y'all was goin' to sleep
Y'all prolly goin' to college, I was all up in the street
Now the music industry is calling me
This big head should've never got released
Trans Am never should've let me off the leash
I'm a veteran, a G
I'mma eat mothafuckas like I'm Hannibal, a beast
Hungry for the money, I'm about to have a feast
When I'm battlin' I'm beast, and I let 'em know
Thinking we ain't deadly down in 7-7-0
Cinnamon and when I'm spittin' venom then they go
Lookin' now like another enemy below
They can see the fro, diamonds and the gold
Jewelery, you should be, shovelin' a pro
Back then gold diggers never would've spoke
Now you see these hoes at the show and

Goin' crazy, too berserk, so high now I'm nuclear
Outta this world, I'm Jupiter, flow so tubular
And I'm smokin' crazy, stupid herb

Anybody lookin' for me you can find me in the A
Find me in the north
Riding in the Cadillac with Lamborghini doors
You can see me in The Source
Representin' Wolf, he the only reason that I even got an opportunity to make some noise
So you know I got his back, representin' Slumerican with the homie Shawty Fatt
G.C., G.A. is the damn campaign
Northside bitch, rep my shit, don't gangbang
Pop a lotta bars, drop a lot of shards
White boys ridin' 'round in Civics and Accords
Dope boys tryna make a livin' off of drugs
Jack boys tryna hit him lookin' at the buzz
We don't wanna fight nobody, we just wanna bust
My homies do the spit, when I do we get a rush
So I do it for the love, 'cause the music in my blood
When I'm in the club 'cause I must be

Sober,The Life and Times of Jonny Valiant,2013.0,"The city is glamming
In the spot coming from my gucci lenses
Plus tour busses scoops and benzes
I ain't used to this I came through the trenches
Now my cousin fill up on boots and end em
Said I can't pronounce multiple bank accounts
Now I give all my hommies all my hand me downs
Shit I used to get a hundred bucks a show
Now I get a couple grand to come and stand around
And drink shots of crown but never snitched to real
One too many gotta catch some air
Rooftop parties bars everywhere
But success don't rest out of hair corvair
Big rozay ho's day when I come and show them
This the me I get 'em tipsy freeze
Be going both ways pussy lickers skills that go showcase
Late night bunch of hoes at my doorway

It's 4 in the morning and the party don't end
Baby come over, baby come over
Our clothes on the ground drinking Crown till we spin
Fuck till we're sober

Two fucker take a break to take a shot
Restaurant closed so we go in
Have my iphone out making homemade porn
And she screaming oh Lord, like she born again
One of us going down on snorkeling
Walk by my hotel room door and
I'm sure you heard us bone and probably came the moment
And fuck a maid keeping knocking reorienting
She give me oral then I told her you're a 10
Lying cause your really bout an eight and a half
But a head game is the greatest I had
It's a damn shame that I'm singing the last
Bet it was a blast she was making the splash
And I got one more favor to ask
Can I put a little bit cocaine on your ass
I took a sniff and I told the bitch slider this mess

It's 4 in the morning and the party don't end
Baby come over, baby come over
Our clothes on the ground drinking crown till we spin
Fuck till we're sober

I'm feeling like a rabbit coming out of the egg
Feeling like a motherfucker breaking down record my tool
The nerve of this nigga with a flat on glove
Hella body with a bounce this is pimpin ho
Polished, Groomed! shake with a fine grim
And buffed out to a shine that’ll blind a bitch, don’t I walk like I Got I all down to a science bitch
Kinda like domino's pizza
And don't get too comfortable in the morning
Money always feel better than sex to me
The trick if I pick it up and ask for free
Motherfucker flamboyant
When I walked on the snow baby
And the sound of Sade fills the room with jamma bitch which fills my pocket
I like to wiggle wiggle it more I'm a hustler
Walk around pimpin' I don't touch 'em
I thought you knew that pimps don't go to jail
For pimpin', they go for mispimpin'
So don't do that...
And understand God made pimps so a ho can have a man
And a trick won't understand
Suga Free... my man!

Flow so outdated you be slippin' off shit like an old mouse pad
Run around like an old grouch bag
When you see me don't speak like a No Doubt track
Shhh, quiet motherfucker
I don’t recognize you 'cause we only met once
Even if we met twice on a night when I wasn’t that drunk
I still don’t recall what the fuck your name was –
What I look like, bitch?
Teacher calling out names in a homeroom class? Hell nah
Hear my speakers straight bang in an old school 'Lac
Think everybody lame like white boys tryna bring boat shoes back
Motherfuckers who carry guns, knowing damn well that they won’t shoot back
But you look cool though, just kidding, no you don’t, douchebag
But if I was cool as you I would go into a new car dealership and shoot up the showroom glass
Like a badass would
Scream like you want a bitch, scream like you have bad blood
Like a badass does
Take a picture with your gun, post it up, sayin' #thug
Go and tat that up

You’re the opposite, lame-ass white boy dropping N bombs
Who the fuck are you, the white Chief Keef?
Need to stop that shit (ol’ white ass boy)

Hate to rain on your parade, but I got bad news
You ain’t never gonna make it, and it’s better that you face it
You ain’t never made dope songs

Man, I still can't believe he won
Fuck paper, he gon’ make it rain those bombs
And I’m sick of politics like chicks postin' pics with the Snapchat filter of puppy dog ears and a rainbow tongue
Flower crown on your head, make your eyes look pretty, lookin' shitty with no make-up on
Really got some little titties, but you tricked us 'cause you had a bunch of padding in an A-cup bra

Got a Famous hoody, some retro 4s
Some expensive jewelry, a disco ball
On my trigger finger, a missile launch
'Bout to happen any second it’s an intro for verse three

Superman blending in like I’m Clark Kent
Fuck how big your bark is, you ain’t got the heart
Better sharpen your skills, I’m a killer, you a marked man
When it’s all said and done, you’ll be burned to a crisp
Smokin', I can smell the cartilage and charred skin
Set 'em on fire
Used to have it up high now look how low the bar been
Look how many off brand rappers put they palm print on it
'Cause they shinin' for a moment
They go broke and then they starve, damn

Got diamonds in my ring, got diamonds in my watch band

I’m No Good,Top of the Line,2016.0,"Yeah
Sometimes I just get fucking pissed off
I just get sick of all this bullshit

Shit's sad growing up in the gutter
But I made a lot of kids want to be like I am
It's weird, people see you on the come up
Think you happy with some money but I'm mean and I'm pissed
My girlfriend knows that I love her
But I mentally abuse her and I treat her like shit
We both suicidal, she a cutter
All I do is self-loath, what's the reason I live?
Bunch of empty liquor bottles in the cupboard
Lying to each other like next week we'll quit
Get drunk, make a straw outta dollar
But it's okay, it's only cocaine, not meth
My family looking at me like a fuck up
And they're right, and I don't want to disappoint my twin
I pray one day I'll recover
But it's like I'm tryin' to schedule an appointment with the - devil
Lord knows I don't wanna - die
So I'm begging, praying help me please
I lie like I'm covering for someone
With anxiety and I ain't got no self-esteem
Lot of people are going wanna tell me shut up
Cause they got it way worse, I'm a selfish piece of shit
Make a motherfucker wonder, what it's gonna take for me to change mentally
Bags underneath my eyes cause I live too fast
Grey hairs on my beard
Feelin' like I can't breathe if I don't take a pill so I'm always on a Xan
Drink a bottle every night, I feel them doing damage to my liver
I ain't ever been this fat and disgusting
I don't wanna rap, I wanna nap on my love-seat
I ain't sayin' this to get no pity, I'm just feelin' shitty
Lookin' like a piece of metal rusting, and trust me

And I don't really like
The person I've become
This isn't who I thought I would turn into when I was young
But now I'm grown and they say I'm
No Good (x6)
I'm just a drug addict, drunk, I'm
No Good (x6)
They say I need to turn my life around

I don't know, maybe I'm a hater
I'm supposed to write a rap, but I hate rap now
Stop breathin' when I'm sleeping then I wake up
Still in my clothes, can't remember how I passed out
Lately I'm an angry drunk am I'm afraid I
Might have been a dick, best friend's gettin' cussed out
But, fuck it then I guess I'll found out later
What I done, 'nother hungover day bummed out
True shit I ain't no exaggerator
Nose bleedin', trying to act like I ain't sniff shit
People think they're motivating me to take up a different lifestyle
Fuck them and their Fitbit
They just wanna help but don't appreciate uh
Cause they love me, and they don't wanna see me die young
Every day I'm dissapointin' my creator
I've been strugglin' to get up out the hole I dug
Lately I've been switchin' over to the vapor
Chain smokin Newports hope I don't crush my lungs
I can see my future and it's as plain as day my
Girl cryin' to the operator, calling 9-1-1
I tour, blessed to be an entertainer
Been spendin' months away from home, there's nothing I find fun
Signed a record deal, I love the record label
Three albums later, underrated when it's my time come
Couldn't afford the tour bus, so I went and bought a van
There's some money selling records, so I got to tour again
I don't wanna bore the fans, so I bought a couple lights
Plus some background singers, but I can't afford a band
Jealous of these rich rappers and the money that they make
I was up outside of Chili's having lunch and a lame
Started 
rooting
 for his team on the screen
When I see happy people wanna punch them in the face
I'm ashamed cause

I don't really like
The person I've become
This isn't who I thought I would turn into when I was young
But now I'm grown and they say I'm
No Good (x6)
I'm just a drug addict, drunk, I'm
No Good (x6)
They say I need to turn my life around

Yeah!

Stop Breathing,Top of the Line,2016.0,"Strange Music in this bitch hoe
Ain’t no record label better, cause I said so
Tech ever said to get them ready, set, go
I’mma dead them, I can let them think they got the best flow
Think about tryin' me, just don't
Had to add another rapper to the death toll
They go making death threats and I'm playing 'til they laying
In the grave and they engraving ""Dead broke"" on your headstone
Stacking dough up like I'm breakin' bread loafs
And I'm seein' more commas
The more that I tour around the country
I be sticking up like I'm a sore thumb, you
Thinking 'bout sticking me, you sort of unfortunate
Cause I be ready for you when you and your boys run up
Poor son of a bitch, give us a board at the morgue and the core
Runner sent the shots toward right to the door of your 4-Runner
More money is more drama
Fuck it though cause I was broke up rollin' up
Coins gonna, make a bar or song
Hopin' we gone get through the storm comin'
So fuck anybody tryin' to strong-arm us
Rollin' over snakes in the grass with the lawnmowers
They thinking I'ma start ballin' and crossover
And I can tell the haters see we have success
Well we ain't on the same level homeboy
Looking down while they gasp for breath and all I heard was

I can’t feel my arms, I can’t feel my legs
I can’t breathe, I can’t breathe

Who said I'm a real one?
Got a text message from Rittz told me to kill one
I’m a send a few shots I'm 'bout it
Think a nigga replying, doubt it
I can have the whole block surround me
Find a nigga, I ground and pound it, and bound it
Yeah, anybody can get it, I got a vendetta
Ready, giving it to whatever that been better
Depend whether the creme de la
Then when they come into the ring, I'm here, swing batter
You don't really want to revel with the rebel
Gotta take 'em to a whole 'nother level
Got the holes and the shovel
You and your man, gonna bury ya together
You seem a little shook, hear ya heartbeat
A little situation when you cross me
I'm a feed ya to the gators
You a motherfucking hater, need to be a bunch of paper once you walk me
Fuck around lose a limb, nigga saw me
Pussy nigga don't taunt me
I have ya homies out bleeding from a lung
You're panickin' and callin out 911, what's the fuss 'bout

Everybody wanna rap nowadays
Everybody wanna rap, they don’t even need a reason
Everybody and they mama wanna rap
Who the hell they following? Is anybody leading?
Can’t call it like a land line, can’t stand on it like a land mine, homie hold up
You about to get everything you said you ever wanted, literally finna blow up
They don’t like me, so what? Ain’t a damn thing changed since back in the day
True dick finna go nuts, I don’t rap like them, I don’t play that way
And I don’t wanna fan out, looking for a hand out
Or acting like an idiot because I wanna stand out
Following into the letter when it's planned out
Got a nigga suffocating with his hands out

Top of the morning, I’m taking my spot
Drop without warning, I’m neighborhood watch
Top of the line and I'll aim at your wig
Who you know? What set do you claim? Where you live?
Better roll up with Strange with the Tech and the Krizz
Stevie Stone, the game with the CES and the Rittz
Got them running til ain't nothin left in the limbs
And now they feeling the pain in they chest and they rib
Blaring they tongue twist
They suffocatin' and heading for peristalsis
And now they can't even get any air at all
It's getting darker, I think it'd be fair to call this
Prepare an offense or carry a coffin
I can make a call and leave you buried in Boston
Ever met a martyr? Now the killer married to karma
Never forget about Eric Garner, I can't breathe

All We Know,White Jesus Revival,2012.0,"It's a problem when you
Can't afford to eat shit but a double cheese from the dollar menu
Gotta pay in quarters
Bitch behind the window pissed she sick of taking orders
Shit aren't we all
Ridin round on E waitin for the car to stall
With a engine cut chick lookin in the mirror puttin on lipstick wishin that she lookin like a barbie doll
Infatuated with all the stars in hollywood wanna wear what the rappers wore
Buy shoes that you can't afford
With no gas in your car to go to the package store to get a pint of martins
Wishin you could drink ciroc I had a brand new watch that didn't turn your wrist green its not cool to shop at K-Mart
The Girls all think you twat
You start hustlin n bumpin
You was movin and end up getting pop'ed
And now you locked up
Pacin and Facin time
Every time you call home your lady cryin
Talk about her period late and I'm pregnant no you ain't what you think I'm blind
The doc say It's a boy we gon name him Brian
He said first we gon make sure the baby mine
I know you out there fuckin bitch thinks I'm blind

Sometimes it feels like there ain't no hope
When all you see is darkness it's hard to blow
Holdin' to the scars so the pain don't show
Holdin' to the past 'cuz we can't let go
Don't blame us 'cuz it's all we know
This is all we know (X2)

Luxuries
Got a couple bucks in my pocket next to my cutlass keys
Don't gotta tuck my piece
Gotta couple soldiers with me attention at ease
With no associate degrees but still better than a drug disease
We confused and lost
Poppin. Loritab, Roxy, Oxy contin
...goin through withdrawals...no mood...
Called my homeboy trynna shoot the shit. ""Hello""
Dude its Rittz what the hell been up?
He said that he fell in love with some stupid bitch in one month she was movin in
Everything goin good then his boo done went and left him for a minute, had loot to spend
Now he said he feels stupid, said he gonna shoot her, see the tool homie gonna do em in
All I could say was keep your head up
He said what is that? Never mind dog It was good to catch up
Feelin that though he never really had love
We all done bad shit doesn't add up
Laying with a bad bitch on a mattress
So the dude like me can't get a back rub
These days we pray please holla back god
But I guess you gotta take the good with the bad so


All she wanted was to have some kids
And a husband, love and happiness
Sayin' where does a life like that exist?
No family, she ain't seen daddy since she came out the womb with a bunch of bastard kids who got dissed with the disadvantages
So the optimism vanishes
Made a wish when she lit the candle stick
Like God hear me out
I appreciate you
I don't wanna seem like I'm being ungrateful
I'm lucky that I'm livin I ain't been no angel
But ever since grade school shit has been painful
I don't owe a person a explanation
How am I to live up to your expectations
I'm addicted to meth to say that I'm depressed is an understatement
Estimation. Need some medication or at least some love
My boyfriends cheatin, he beats me up
Gotta best friend but shes strung out too
When I talk to her she says join the club
And I dont wanna die but I'm losin my will to live
Please God forgive
In the name of Jesus I pray Amen

Middle of Nowhere,Last Call,2017.0,"Rittz up in this bitch again
Those who listen, witnessin'
Uncut dope, I lift a pen
And those who diss get disciplined
My imprint is infinite
Getting tense and intimate
When I'm pissed shit hits the fan
(Who's ready for Rittz?!)

This rap game's so mundane, I just play dumb
Trying to listen to songs playing, then what main come
Making fun of them, none of them ever was A1
Trying to front like they John Wayne, well I'm James Bond
In my blood-stained tux, people that played me they thinking they got away with it
I'm taking out my frustration
Finally shedded the dead weight, settled the debt, paid
We done shoveled the red clay, we dug graves up
Got a couple of homies that owe me some favors
And show they appreciation, they told me that they would bust they guns
But instead of it I debted it and just gave love
I’ve been heavily indebt and I done took pay cuts
Might have been a lot to me, to them it was just cake crumbs
I’ve done been around a minute, but I just came up
Hungry for dinner, but shit, I just ate lunch
At the Optimus, tapas, scallops and crustaceans
Tuna tartare, the way to act above all, like wah lah
I’m sipping crown and soda, but I would rather have the monarch
Thinking bout how far came when I’m out on tour
4 AM I’m in the bed, I’m drunk and I’m staring at the wall art
I fought off the competition like I was a war lord
I swore I should have blew in 2002, but given a minute
I would hit a higher altitude, then I surprised you from out the blue

From the middle of nowhere
People wonder how I blew, where I come from
The middle of nowhere
I'm on tour my crowd's the proof, in some town in
The middle of nowhere
You should watch your mouth 'cause you, might get punched from
The middle of nowhere
It might be lights out for you, you get found in
The middle of nowhere

This your first time hearing me, then you should go backwards
Listen to 
Top of the Line
 and study the craftwork
Then check out
 Next to Nothing
, that was me expressing what I thought it was and what it wasn’t by becoming a rapper
After that then play 
The Life and Times of Jonny Valiant
Listen to ""My Interview"" and study my answers
Then check out 
White Jesus
, that was me, yeah
In the studio after working a double and my back hurt
Staining my apron, pouring buckets in the grease trap
Thinking that I need to try and take a G.E.D. class
Thirty and hurting for money, feeling like a sleaze bag
Feelings that I had are reoccurring when I recap
People biting me up in my lane without a Peach Pass
I ain’t gonna touch on that
I put on debt, but look I’m next, I took my steps, I stood out
I’m feeling like there ain’t no one I couldn't out-rap
But since I made it people wonder why I look all mad
Because I’ve been trying to ride a wave, I'm in a boat without a paddle
Start to notice shit as I was growing as an adult
It’s hard for me to sugarcoat it like a bowl of Kellogg’s
They love you for a minute, but they’re quick to say you fell off
But I’ve been getting bigger and bigger and bigger
Mistaking me from the beginning, they still be getting overshadowed
The fans love me and they gonna travel to the

The middle of nowhere
People wonder how I blew, where I come from

I'm on tour my crowd's the proof, in some town in

You should watch your mouth 'cause you, might get punched from

It might be lights out for you, you get found in

Want bars or want me to chop?
I’mma do both then, I’m like a piranha inside a bowl of goldfish
It’s hard for you to smell me like your nose is clothes pinned
I went and did a show in Minnesota, Bone Twins
No shit, so lit, no rapper’s my match
With white trash, getting money acting high class
High stacks, it’s hard to fold the bills
Pockets fat as Jonah Hill before and after the gastric bypass
Chugging the Zinfandel, then I smash the wine glass
Picture my dick, the bitches had to bat they eyelash
A maximum line slash from Dimebag Darrell, long hair and don’t care I wanna catch down back
You at the IMAX theatre ‘bout to see me in 3D
Listening like they had me wiretapped
Paid cash for fast cars, you had to finance
Scientist inside of my lab

In the middle of nowhere
People wonder how I blew, where I come from
The middle of nowhere
I'm on tour my crowd's the proof, in some town in

Just really don't know how to talk no more, man
Don't know how to tell you the truth, bitch
(Juh-uh-JEAH!) Truth is gonna hurt you
And the truth might stop me from gettin some pussy
..So I'mma lie to you
I'm fulla shit though, you know?
{Burn One, Burn One}

I guess I'm, I guess I'm, fulla shit
I don't know, how to, treat a bitch
My momma said, I shoulda had, brown eyes
Cause why? Because I'm, fulla shit
I'm fulla shit, I guess I'm, fulla shit
I don't know, how to, treat a bitch
My momma said, I shoulda had, brown eyes
Cause why? Because I'm, fulla shit

Bitch ask me my name, I'll lie to ya
Take it that I'm really incitin' up
Me just sayin you're a dimepiece, when you're really a 5
But I still run up inside of ya
And sayin' bye to ya, my girl she's so proud of the
New Prada stuff, I just bought her but
She can't tell it's a knockoff from the flea market
I'm a piece of garbage, huh?
But truth be told, I always was
Tell a bitch whatever, make her fall in love
Tell her that I hate her best friend, then I call her slut
But when she ain't around, I call her up
We got high, drunk a buncha alcohol and fucked
Bitch found out and her heart was crushed
Cryin to me but I told her it never meant nothin
It was innocent fuckin, that was all it was
Swear on everything and to God above
That I love you and I made a mistake
Lyin' to her, sayin' shit like her friend
Couldn't even give head and her pussy just stank
Like it's all about you girl, what I gotta do girl?
Tell me and I'll make it okay
So I bought the bitch a ring from the stall in the mall
And the bitch couldn't tell that was diamonds is fake
Shit, just the other day, I was ridin with a chick
In my Cutlass, blazin dat herb (dat herb)
We was snortin that white girl, with a liquor bottle
In the console, wait it gets worse (worse)
Some cop pulled me over, I'm not really sober
I know I'm goin' to jail if they search
So I threw the coke into in her purse
When they ask about it, I'mma say that it's hers
I'm fulla shit!

I guess I'm, I guess I'm, fulla shit

My momma said, I shoulda had, brown eyes

I'm fulla shit, I guess I'm, fulla shit
I don't know, how to, treat a bitch
My momma said, I shoulda had, brown eyes
Cause why? Because I'm, fulla shit

Now when I say that I love you shawty, that really mean ""Let's fuck!""
I can't see pass yo' lipgloss, prayin you down to suck
Don't confuse me on no day, for a good guy that don't stray
For a bitch with a fat ass and mouth, how the world the devil stay?
Now don't play like you ain't down for beatin'
Pussy juice is secretin all on the table you eat at
Don't get shocked shit was did, if I bust you can keep it
Grab my clothes and some food up off in yo' stove
I sneak out the do', that's why you sleepin
Sayin', ""Krizzle, that's too cold,"" my momma said, ""Sew ya oats""
I plow fields of blue pills and jump down a bitch's throat
And summa y'all like dem picket fences with the matchin' shirts with the wedding bells (naw)
Ran off with the bride, interception behind the building, cum in her wedding veil
Maybe that's somewhat out of line, but WHO am I not to hit one mo' time?
'Specially only lovin you and only fuckin you, shit she was prob'ly lyin
Didn't get caught fuckin off with a nigga like me for fun, she was prob'ly tryin'
Ho know I'm fulla shit, but that ain't never stop me from pullin' a bitch
I guess I'm..

I guess I'm, I guess I'm, fulla shit

I don't know, how to, treat a bitch
My momma said, I shoulda had, brown eyes
Cause why? Because I'm, fulla shit

I'm fulla shit, man I got more dirt than a dump truck (dump truck)
Give a bitch a middle finger, make it up like thumbs up (thumbs up)
It's about my execution, lookin for that next-to-boo shit
Holdin' my cell phone, thinkin' how do I make this text confusing (text confusion)
(Yeaaaaaaaah!) Yeah, I'm an artist!
You see a Georgia Peach and see an orange
Squeeze her dry, dry heavin' starvin'
Thirsty hurry, see the garden
Grow the flower, cut the pedals
Give her the bulb because I'm heavy metal
The President a-fulla shit
I pull the shit to make you think I got a vote to settle
Yelawolf is on a whole 'nother level
That motherfucker's hot, don't hold the kettle
Don't put ya finger on the trigger, baby be careful
Shoulda backfired like an armed Beretta
(Chk-BANG!!) Now you done shot ya face off
Rittz I don't really know what to say, y'all
I got so many bodies up under my belt
That I'm runnin out of room, I don't know where to lay y'all
I guess I'm a man yeah, I'm a man head, I'm a man, I'mma run 'til I'm done
I guess I get a kick when I hear a bitch say, ""Hey look bitch, here Yelawolf comes!""
My ego's gettin' bigger though, watchin' my CD go in Best Buy
One of these girls gonna do me like Left Eye

Trunk boomin speakers beatin like the school of hard knocks
Clintel the movement stupid got a large knot
In my pocket they be hatin' on us cause they squad's squat
Local legend I don't got no beef I call shots
North Side representer I've been given carte blanche
Riding Beaver Ruin I just rode this shit from 29 on Buford Highway
Smokin out from Berkmar High to Norcross
Its ghetto up in Meadowcreek I bet if these police they see me riding
They gonna pull me over just because, watch
There ain't shit to do but catch a buzz and bar hop
Chillin in my car parked, smokin' hit the unlock button
Got my door propped open and a couple hoes inside of a Corolla pull up on me and they jaws drop
Pleasant Hill to Pleasantdale smoked so much we left a trail
Bumping Jazzy Belle and Extraterrestrial
Snortin lines SNL
Tryin to bite my fresher feel
Life is like a movie this the director's reel
Blowin kisses to these bitches got 'em catchin' chills
Catchin' feelings bet you if I met you you gon' let me drill

They hate I'm getting paid and I don't have to push a broom a
Cross the kitchen pockets sticking like I'm made of rua
Plus up in a shooters alley where my homie blew a few bucks
We left to get some food, he said he knew a ho at Hooter's
That had to sit with friends that were fans and if they got a chance
To come and party with us they would let do what
Ever so I hit up my connect and and got some mollys
Try to start up a menage pourin' vodka and Kahlua
It's just another day in the life like I just drew a
Picture for you like I'm sitting for the interview with Don Shula
I can coach you how to move like I maneuver
Say the dude ain't cool then fuck off, you a goon or you a shooter
You're assuming I'ma sweat on you like Harry Connick Jr
Slide up to you missy have you screaming ooh aah
I might be in Tucson, Arizona maybe in Missoula
Might be with a country bitch and pull up in Dacula
I might cuss her out drop her off and throw the deuce up
Crazy like I lost a couple screws out my tool box
Bitches try to lay me like they met me at a luau

Fuck Cancer,Last Call,2017.0,"My wife's best friend Wendy, always been the life of the party
She come to chill with my girl at our crib
All three of us drinking from the night to the morning
Her personality is one of a kind, so funny
Make you laugh til you cry from a story
I haven't seen her in a while then my wife came downstairs
Crying saying ""Wendy just called me""
Told me that she thought she had something wrong with her
For a long time, finally went and saw a doctor
They did an ultrasound, found cancer in her thyroid
That was rare and uncommon
Started crying harder, I was try'na calm her
She's the last person that I thought would ever get sick
She's a mom to Sebastian, Mia, and Karma
Hard enough alone, even worse with three kids
Lost a nine to five and the house where she lived
All her belongings that she used to own are gone
Stolen when her mom let her move into her home
Now they gotta go remove a tumor from her throat
Let you know that what you're going through could be worse
Such a strong person, I could never be her
Hoping all the chemo and the surgeries work
The redness on her neck is from the third degree burns
Hurting, try'na turn her head, losing weight, losing hair
Hard to understand her, can't swallow, can't talk
Can't drink water, nurse told her just nod
Choking on the burnt skin, got her coughing up blood
Got a feeding tube feeding through her stomach
Cause she does it when the meds
Ain't working 'cause the chemo got her sick
She could catch a virus easy on the treatment
The doctor says she's not allowed to be around her kids
Gotta smoke a cigarette saying she don't wanna live
But she done come to grips with it coming to an end
She ain't understand at the time
That she had the will inside to survive, dying wasn't in the plan
And she talk about her family and her friends
And her kids, what she been through
For them, she would do it all again
There are people that survived, but there's some that never did
I'm just happy that she's in the situation that she's in
She's alive

They said my time was ticking, I was blown away
Tomorrow isn't promised, I can go today
They told me I was sick inside but I'm okay
Cause when I beat it and survive then I'ma say
Fuck cancer
If I go to bed and die before I wake
I'ma beg and pray the lord my soul to take
'Cause I ain't rolling over, I got total faith
I'ma win the battle, when I do then I'ma say
Fuck cancer

One of my best friends in the whole world felt a lump in his armpit
It was small so he thought it was a bruise
When he saw it getting larger, it started to alarm him
Tried to put it off for as long as he could
But he knew pretty soon that he's gotta see a doctor
When he did, they just said it was an ingrown hair
Don't be scared, 'cause it's probably not a problem
But he still want to get a second opinion so they sent him
To a place they recommended so that he could see a specialist
When they started to examine it, they said
""I hate to say it, I'm afraid that the lump is something cancerous""
Set him up for surgery
They removed the lump, he was try'na not to sweat it
Wondering what the result says
Waited three long days til he finally got to talk to the doctor
He told him he had Hodgkin's, third-degree cancer
That's a lot to process
When he told me, I was thinking anybody not him
He the type of guy that light a room up when he walk in
He just tied the knot, he's a newly wed, a husband
Thought of all the moments in his past, all the time spent
Doing drugs, chasing money, suddenly was nonsense
Told the lord above him he was done with that, I promise
Dying ain't an option, there's too much to accomplish
His father right beside him, caught a flight from Puerto Rico
Sweating out the chemicals inside him from the chemo
His wife was like his rock when he need someone to lean on
And when he's weak, she be motivating him to keep going
Didn't want no pity, only told so many people
Even shot a documentary when he was sick , so
He could reach the people in the same position
Maybe get some optimism
That it's possible to beat it and achieve gold
He's determined he gon' live to see another year
Turned his fear into anger
The anger that's inside of him provided him with strength
Now his vision's clear
Even when they told him he was sick, he never shed a tear
Til the day they called him up and told him he was cancer-free
I could see his mom up in heaven smiling now
Barely recognize him cause he lost a hundred pounds
Muscle bound, running miles, went and turned his life around
He's alive

They said my time was ticking, I was blown away
Tomorrow isn't promised, I can go today
They told me I was sick inside but I'm okay
Cause when I beat it, I'll survive and I'ma say
Fuck cancer
If I go to bed before I die before I wake
I'ma beg and pray the lord my soul to take
'Cause I ain't rolling over, I can total fate

Slum Shit
Yeah

What you mean you don't like my shit?
Well, it's obvious that you don't have no taste and your opinions suck
And I don't expect to be everybody cup of tea
But don't act like I ain't killing everything I touch
I crush every record I'm on
So holla if you wanna get a feature while the price is right
See I try to be friendly, til MCs offend me
And now it's time for y'all to kiss the nice guy good bye
Besides, everyone hanging around me is a big shot
When is it appropriate for me to act like one?
I try to be humble among you motherfuckas
But some of you frontin' really lookin' mad I won
And done what I done already it's barely begun
It's scary cause everyone's wary and they say when I come
Wearin' my hair like it's hilarious tell me what's funny
They running when they see me drunk and my gun
Dumpin' they know they're gonna die...

Die
Haters step aside, they wanna fuck with me
I swear to God, I’ll kill 'em 'til they show respect, or not
And everybody’s gonna
Die
Dead, shedding blood
I got the grave digger diggin' ya plot
I got ya body rottin' deep in the ground
Cause everybody gonna
Die

I'm not used to this music shit
I guess that I'm cut from a different cloth
Photographers, bloggers, producer pricks
And musicians as a whole are starting to piss me off
Not all, just some of them rub me wrong
Is it possible that everyone's an entrepreneur?
Talking to you like they a Hollywood star
And you should be lucky that they even let you get your foot in the door
All I hear is an ear full of manure
I don’t know how much more I can ignore, they just tryin too hard
To be cool, and cuttin edge and wiggle they fucking dreads
I feel like I'm surrounded by dorks and corn balls galore
Does anybody know I'm up? I'm torn
I'm going off on 'em and I'm continuing the manure
Maybe I should have my boys tie 'em up with the phone cord
At gun point and tell em hit the floor
Cause everybody gon' die

Die
Haters step aside, they wanna fuck with me
I swear to God, I’ll kill 'em 'til they show respect, or not
And everybody’s gonna
Die
Dead, shedding blood
I got the grave digger diggin' ya plot

It's Jonny Valiant: the head turner
I turned to a head hunter
I bet if I met - one of your girls I got head from her
And came on the bed comforter and she didn't swallow it
I zipped up my denims and then I gave her a fake number
And told her to ""Hit me up, it's totally cool ho,""
My homie co-signed me so I came in and bull-dozed
My way in the industry any rapper offended
And wanna test me let me know I'll get to cover ya tombstone
I cock away all the way pull my weapon and draw
Homie by the way, I don't play, disrespect me I brawl
Take your life away by the way I'm as deadly as Saw
I'll prolly be a killer 'til I'm George Jefferson bald
Look at 'em all running for cover, they panicking
Frantically, they don't even stand a chance with me
My plan's to be famous and get a bad bitch
Maybe Casey Anthony'll marry me

Happy Ending,Last Call,2017.0,"Feel like I got too much on my plate at once (plate at once, plate at once)
But I ain't got no place to run
Where do I draw the line cause I know I can't walk a straighter one (straighter one, straighter one)
Waiting on a chance to come
Only you can make a change cause you ain't getting waited on (waited on, waited on)
So really what you waiting on
Everyone that I hung around feeling bummed and they barely hanging from
A string believing in they faith in God
Blame it on the past but problems pop up unannounced
We so drunk that we forgot what we was arguing about
Wanna put the bottle in the trash but I can't 'cause I'm afraid to go without
All I really wanted was a wife and a family, maybe one day own a house
But it ain't that simple with addiction, can't control myself
Gotta get back my ambition, if I don't I fail
Only you can make the right decision, no one else
Instead of going to anger that you're holding
Let it go, 'bout to take a load off, now I just be

Riding by my lonely (lonely, lonely)
Blowing out the smoke trying to ease my mind
The stars above are glowing (glowing, glowing)
I see em and I hope they can be a sign
There ain't no way of knowing (knowing, knowing)
What the future holds, we can speed up time
'Cause life is like a story (story, story)
I'm hoping in the end things'll be just fine

There's a happy ending at the end of every motion picture
(Motion picture, motion picture) But we ain't on no movie set
People look for love but what they visionin' is fiction
(-in' is fiction, -in' is fiction)But this ain't Romeo & Juliet
Friends'll disappear like they were tricked by a magician
(By a magician, by a magician) Out of a hundred, just a few are left
Thinkin' that this shirt that's on my back, that that'll fix it
(That'll fix it, that'll fix it) We're all a victim of a booby trap
Thought that we'd be paid, livin' straight, by the age of 25
Then I'm not, by the time that we were 30, surely, shit will turn around
But it kept reversin' further down the road, it's worser now
Now we lost in the dark, and this spark that we had in our head we burned it out
But I refuse to be content with the status quo
Used the rap platform as a way to vent my
Pain that's inside and maybe then by
Doin' so it might can be a way to lend my
Hand to help somebody that the weight done pinned down
They goin' into work with a fake, pretend smile
To pay the rent by the end of the month
Take a minute, decompress, get high, I just be

Riding by my lonely (lonely, lonely)
Blowing out the smoke trying to ease my mind
The stars above are glowing (glowing, glowing)
I see em and I hope they can be a sign
There ain't no way of knowing (knowing, knowing)
What the future holds, we can speed up time
'Cause life is like a story (story, story)
I'm hoping in the end things'll be just fine

Happy ending, this ain't no album cut
I wrote this for those who pre-order my CD
A simple rap is an appetizer to satisfy them, wish this was a sneak peek
Or the full length album, wearin' this out, you gonna get it with a poster, or free tee
I be signing my booklets, I'm lookin', I'm thinkin' 'bout how good it is to be me
I just want to thank you, four albums later and shit still don't seem real to me
Y'all are the reason my dream came true, you gave me the ability
To have a full time job as a rapper, so many told me to quit, it was impossible
Even if I had a record deal I could never pay the bills
And nobody came to watch my show
I spend your hard earned money when you buy my merch
Money that you spent helped me buy my first
New car and a house even wife my girl
When I write you ignite all the fireworks
Being patient in the line for the meet and greet
But the pleasures all mine, want to shake your hand
You could be brand new or a day one, I'm grateful you became my fan
You might follow me on Facebook and Instagram
Some people got tattoos of me, that's permanent
I want to say how grateful I truly am
I want to put it into words, I can't
It doesn't do it justice for you, it does shit
In layman terms, it's time to wave the flag
C-N-T in this bitch, we the crew
And I owe all to you and the snake and bat

Y'all don't know shit
Y'all just go off what you see in IG
And be pressing the keypad
I don't let em see half of my real life
Almost seen death, clean, fresh out of rehab
Phone don't work, can't take calls
Still got some anxiety I can't shake off
But I can't take bars
Last two years I've been living off of credit
They suspended on my Amex card
Want to wallow in a bottle and a Kleenex box
Pillow case stained with dried up tears
Some of the fans understand
Others can't, listening wondering how'd I wind up here
Like I made a living trying to fuck up my career
I don't think I've ever been this angry
Stint with the record label ended strangely
Cause our friendship was short but was business mainly
In suspension dangling like a dead deer bleeding out
Suicide attempt in Anchorage but I failed to jump
The happy drunk guy that I was died
Follow me you'll probably see me self destruct
With my explosive temper burning hotter than a pot of molten amber
Told my closest friends that I'ma kill them too but I don't remember
Now my wife gotta fight lymphoma cancer, goddamn!
Hook
My life fucked up, I may break down (may break down)
My life my luck, oh wait what now (wait what now)

Verse 2:
I was all the way broke back in 2016
Trying hard to keep it hush hush
Plus a couple headbutts caused strain in between me and Strange
And replaced where the puppy love once was
Threw a sucker punch even though we touched gloves
Started feeling like the whole fight was rigged
Really should have reconsidered reigniting shit
Cause I got nothing but respect deep inside for Tech
I was convinced again that I could only write on METH
I'm always in a bad mood and geeked
And I can count on one hand how much I've had sex
Me and my wife hate life
All we do is sleep
Spend all my money on a murder
I'ma do this free soon to be on the road again to earn it back
I went to Germany, Austria, Prague and Saudi Arabia
Never thought that I would take a loss over thirty racks, long gone
Hot headed, blood boiling more
I'm a wreck settling debt from the tour before
I've never seen my credit score this poor
I'm back to rolling quarters up
And buying 40's from the corner store
Straight flexin' for the crowd like I'm Gorgeous George
Meet and greets full of fake handshakes and lies
Everyday I will pray I die
Cause if I don't soon I'm afraid I'll take a life because

Verse 3:
Let's recap, I done went flat broke
If I ever had hope for the future then I was wrong
Why'd I try so long
Why did I get on around the same time people stopped buying songs
Why the guy that's known for giving me a break
Be the main artist they compare me to
My first album sold a couple hundred thousand
Never catapulted me to where I planned it to
There was label friction, cocaine addiction
Hard to separate the real from the fake and fiction
We've been saving six years
We finally had the wedding money
Two weeks before the ceremony my fiance took a sharp blade to her neck and wrists
Every turn was a burning bridge
My manager was so concerned he quit
We can't work anymore
Wasn't sure who this person is
Drunk, blurting shit loud on my phone on the runway
Plane suits came kicked me off the plane
And I was really on some murder shit
In San Francisco in the dark, stalking prey
The elephant inside the room was obvious
Look at all the alcohol we drank
We couldn't hold down food
On the stage about to fall and faint
I want to pray to God but I'm ashamed
Because I HATE MY LIFE

Side Note,Last Call,2017.0,"I don’t need much , take a puff of the wax pen
We in Colorado Springs, the dispensary was hooking up the gift bags
I’m relaxin, that Gorilla Glue dropped the bomb on me like The Gap Band
Uh, poppin xannies like they candy cuz if not then I’m a mad man
Takin shots on top of it, I'm talking then
Sounding like a mumble rapper with a fake down south accent
Chief Jinks on my side, keep his eyes on my back like a dash cam
Any feature will get lit up like a matchstick
They be covering their face and ducking like they gonna do a dab dance
Yeah, I’m fat with some fast hands
Drunk vision like a camera with a cracked lens
Take a fat bitch, fuck her from the ass end
Bed-bath-pussy smelling like a big mouth bass fish… just playing
Class clown, never got to throw my cap as a graduate
First period, we laughing on acid
Half of the class didn’t pass on they math quiz
Glad that this rap shit happened
Haven’t adapted to acting, having to ass kiss
Fuck no, you could blow me like you play the trombone
Let em choke on my dick like it’s a gag gift
Rappers coming up to me like what the price tag is on a feature?
Shit, I could do it for the three I guess
Just send the cheese and the beat, I bet
The second that I send it back they gon rewrite theirs
To me it ain’t quite fair, but so be it
We ain’t in the same weight class
Fuck it, they already paid cash
I’m high, eating Five Guy’s fries
Five guys, be the same amount of rappers that it take to make a Drake track
I’m a Drake fan
Look, I done came to grips with the fact that my favorite rappers quit
And I had to take a pick, is it Drake, is it J. Cole or Kendrick?
Kendrick got the win
I’m just wishing  Eminem, Scarface, Outkast, Jiggaman would have warned us this would be the end
These other guys they don’t keep me intrigued, influenced and inspired
The same cadences on every record, the same BPM
But I’d rather listen to country than EDM
Up in the charger with the
Yo, Gotti is dope
Money is close
Under your nose
Runnin' we both
Gotta go
Having you blow
Money, we ballin like we globe
Trottin and no
Body can go
Copy the rope
But if they don't
Got it you need to go get a ghost-writer
And don’t, plot on me homie
You gon end up with your nose, bloody
Now go, study the greats
Get the Goonie Mob’s Soul Food studying the thought process
All I hear is a blood nonsense, rappers speaking third person
And said they got a god complex
Whatchu, Juan Valdez? You a character?
Loch Ness, daddy long legs getting caught up in my cobwebs
Shot up in my conquest, not even a contest
Get your whole squad jacked, watch how much you broadcast...
I’m-not, the-kind, to-turn-a-blind, eye-to-why
I’m the underdog who never gets the credit I deserve
They try to hold me back on purpose people scared of what I did already
Time-after-time, labels-sign, dime a dozen artists
You could argue who the hardest but regardless every album that I drop is critically acclaimed
And people say I’m legendary
I know, I know, tell me something I don’t
I’m a headliner, homie, I’m no side show
Might go in front of me and I throw spirals
Shining like a Michael in a jacket made of rhinestones
My go, my go, I ain’t scared to climb no, mountain
I done came this far and did it with a blind fold
I’m so ice cold, on the mic
Just dropped, Tiger Wood’s mugshot, I go viral
I'm no Myro, White Gold chain with a snake and bat logo
See the diamonds, hit the high note
Hoping Tech N9ne know I try to do my best to represent what he created and
Appreciate the shine shown
We the artist, CNT, it’s a movement
It started out with the homies wrapping in the gutter
Strange Music introduced me to world
Number 2 if you’re talkin bout numbers, motherfucker
It’s Rittz, Bitch
Outro:
[ Rittz: I’m sick, bitch. For real, I’m sick
Woman: What’s wrong, baby?
Rittz: I’m not feeling so well
Woman: You want me to get you anything? Any food? Want me to get you a drink or something?
Rittz: You know what would really make me feel good right now?

Got the devil pokin' at you with his pitchfork
Thinkin' you'd be old and rich as fuck but now you piss poor
Plus you got a bunch of kids you got to fend for
Baby food and insurance
Ain't no optimism when you livin' life that you don't enjoy
You feel like jumpin' off the tenth floor
At ya 9 to 5, shoulda been a year since you been employed
Injured, I'm just tryin' to vent lord
My lady sick as fuck and I can't  get her insured
People at the hospital treated us like trash
No cash for the bills, no check to pay the landlord
I'm trynna write and set a benchmark
But its hard with all the drama in my life I gotta endure
At least I'm not up in the pen for
Somethin' that I did as a kid, bunch of men without a mentor

Lost in the world, trynna find a way
Caught in the flames with no fire escape
Darkness replacing the brighter days
That's when I look up in the sky and pray and I beg
God, don't strike me down
God, don't strike me down
God, don't strike me down
If this my life, show me how to ride it out I feel...

Ain't no peaches, Sandy Beaches or no palm trees
Strong armed out of peace like it's beyond reach
Struggle since the day you had a heartbeat
Ten family members packed in an apartment like they sardines
Thought I had a Ozz beat
Newborn baby covered straight up in a car seat
And dreams of livin' like the Cosbys, are over when the
Homies that you grow up with are murderers and car thieves
Hustlin' on the corner in the harsh heat
Ridin' dirty in a rental car deep PD
Pull you over, handcuff you on the concrete
Said you got a warrant you're involved in a stolen credit card ring
The number of my homies gunnin' so it daunts me
Wish they were Here to see my name up on the Marquee
We put our glasses up for them and that Cairoc piece
Gettin' drunk, geeked up, singin' off key we

God please forgive me
I had so much evil in me
As a teen and then we
Turned into grown men with no men to teach me
How to get rid of my demons that seem to send me
Further away from your spirit, I keep descending
And I keep befriending
The wrong people to be depending
On for positive energy but I keep extending
My hand out, family condemning me
My knees are bending
As I pray to you
I try to walk a straight line but the rope that's underneath my feet is flimsy
But I promise if I fall off, I'll keep attempting
And I know you heard that a hundred times, I keep on sinning
Been a loser all my life so it's hard envisioning me winning
In the name of Jesus, amen, I pray, I hope my life'll have a peaceful ending
Cause I'm

So Long,Last Call,2017.0,"We gather here today to pay our last respects amid a sad but fond farewell
We are also here in our own way to honor and celebrate your life

When I first met you, it was back in '95
When I used to battle other rappers at the football game
In the crowd you would always stand out
8th grader big as hell but you ain't' never look your age
In 9th grade you were killin seniors on the field
People talkin' bout the records that they watch you break
Popular as hell, everbody knew Charles
Bondin with you on the night we slap boxed and blazed
We was up in Breckeridge Crest we were just kids
Smokin blunts in front of your apartment place
You introduced me to my best friend who was your best friend
I remember when he called that day
He told me that they shot you in the back you was winnin in a fight
And ever since it ain't been quite the same
So much personality and talent why they had to take your life away
I'm screamin hold on

I'm screaming hold on
Here one day and the next they gone
But they way too young to have to tell 'em so long
So long
Have to tell 'em so long

You was a new kid at school from New Jersey
Used to rock the Timbaland boots with the camo suit
Used to go inside the kids' pockets in the parking lot before school
They were scared of you
Me and you were cool
We had mutual friends bumpin' DJ Clue up in RJ's crib
You had a reputation for playing no games
Hitting licks and making people take off all they shit
As time went on, you became a good friend, let your guard down
We would smoke and talk 'bout rap
When Slick was in jail you would check up on me
Told me call you if I had a problem 'cause you got my back
When I was outta work, selling herb, you would front me QP's
Chill and listen to the verse I dropped
Me and you was laughing saying it's ironic that my mama was your nurse when you first got shot
In your shoulder but you took it like a soldier
Had somebody watching over you for you to take a shotgun blast
We were growing older I was broke and always working
All the homies in the circle sort of lost contact
Until the person came into my job
I thought I overheard him saying that somebody murdered One-Arm Black
I ain't believe it til my homie told me that you're gone and you won't come back

I'm screaming hold on
Here one day and the next they gone
But they way too young to have to tell 'em so long
So long
Have to tell 'em so long

It's kinda hard for me to write
I been missing you from the day
That we moved back in Summer '88
When we come to visit you, we always wanna stay
You would wake us up to a plate of scrambled eggs
You taught me how to cook, taught us how to fish
You and Dave hoping that the Steelers win the game
We would all laugh
We knew when they screwed up a play
Cause you would start yelling at the screen
Taught me to enjoy simple things
It would mean the world
Sitting on the porch with you when you feed the squirrels
Whistle with the birds
Full from the meal that you made us
Chill, watch Vanna on the Wheel
Come and spend Christmas with you every year
Summers too, when I'm home wishing I was there
Next to you and Ma-maw sitting in your chair
I could never fit into the slippers that you wear
Tell a joke here and there
You ain't really say much, giving your opinion or a comment
You drove a tank in the second World War
Was in combat, you ain't ever brag about your time in
You had open heart surgery when you were in your sixties
Never thought you would see ninety
Saw us go through phases, you would never judge us
All you did was love us, blindly , when finally
I had a day off right before a show in Pittsburgh
I was happy I could spend it with you
The rest of the family come and visit you a lot last five years
I don't really get to
Mom said you were really sick too
Had a big bruise on you 'cause you fell in the shower
And now all you wanna talk about all the plans
What Ma-maw s'posed to do without you
Having trouble getting in and out your chair
Noddin' out in the middle of a sentence while you're talking
I can tell that your frail and you fought death off for so long
Now you finally feel exhausted
Time to go, I don't really wanna leave
Said I love you Pat like it's gonna be my last
Five days later, I was told that you passed
And you finally let go of your grasp

Hold on
Still we mourn can't believe that you're gone
But your spirit lives on and on, through us for so long
So long
Have to tell 'em so long",https://genius.com/Rittz-so-long-lyrics

Got to put some  on, I almost ran into a Camry

Smelling like some pine trees, smoking with the windows up
The cops are right behind me, pull me over they gon' fine my buzz
So I hid it in my underwear, it’s reeking so much, still smell
Guess I’m paranoid cause I just seen 'em make a quick left
Accelerated on the pedal and I fishtailed

It's like an episode of Spy Vs. Spy
Your god verse mine, the religious beliefs to keep us all divided
I don't care what god you praise
I'm just lucky I'm not stuck in the streets ,starving and naked Through the garbage try'na salvage all the stuff we waste
Feel like Judgment Day might be right around the corner
Water drying up around the world, supply run short
Scientists try to vision life on Mars
More wars make us wanna go and buy more guns
Had one epidemic at the methadone clinic
Your friend or your family member got the zombie face
Our military still at war while we calm and safe
From the Islamic state ,they screaming bombs away
I pray

I don't know how long we got left 'cause God only knows
I think the whole world is spiraling out of control
Take off my blindfold, my eyes open, I don't see hope
I think the whole world is spiraling out of control

First of all, Trump sucks
Let me say it just so I can set the record straight
If that don't make you wanna listen to my record, great
I mean he's funny for a guy with some money
On the news he's entertaining, as a president elect, he ain't
You feel strong about your views, that's cool
Me and you can just agree to disagree
You win, I lose, I'm just voicing my opinion
While I listen to him trying to convince me, saying it is fate
Fake news, fake shoes, fake ass, fake boobs
Fake ass, fake dudes, fake cash, fake nudes
Wait a minute, that was real, Caitlyn Jenner got a pussy?
Now it's hard to see the picture straight
He's fake too, fake proof, fake jewels, fake shoes
Waste spools, wait dude, you ain't gotta fuck
You can shoot it in a cup
You could have a son or a daughter, artificially inseminate
I ain't got a problem with that, or the sexual partners you have
They say to go behind closed doors
I say fuck it, make it a public display
What you choose to do with your body is up to you, I'm prochoice
We got bigger problems to handle, preventing world wars
North Korea with their bombs, showing off in a parade
That's been going on for years, back and forth, it's a game
They improving the nuclear reign so I pray 'cause

I don't know how long we got left 'cause God only knows
I think the whole world is spiraling out of control
Take off my blindfold, my eyes open, I don't see hope
I think the whole world is spiraling out of control

Watching Worldstar, god not again
Another kid shot on a cop's bodycam
Cops got a hard job, could somebody
Not invent a weapon that'll drop a person without causing death?
That's a thought, later on put my phone away
But all the images I've watched are popping up inside my head
Kids knocked out cold, fist fights, air strikes
Rats eating dead mice, someone lost a leg
Lot of kids watching vids that I did
When they put a kitten in a microwave, parents act shocked
Give 'em iPads, pay 'em no attention, no adult restriction
Then you wonder why they having bad thoughts
Got the hammer cocked back on their dad's gun
One mistake and they gon have to say bye world
Was everybody so surprised
Almost every girl in my school acting like the cash me outside girl
How 'bout that?
Young and begging to get pregnant
They were skinny saying now I'm fat
Download apps and still take selfies of themselves
Really selfish they baby daddy bounced
They kid ain't got no dad
But her momma love the drama 'cause it's all she had
She be smoking while the baby in the car seat strapped
Social workers came and got him
Now he's someone else's problem
Looking in the crystal ball, to me it all seems bad
But really

I don't know how long we got left 'cause God only knows
I think the whole world is spiraling out of control
Take off my blindfold, my eyes open, I don't see hope
I think the whole world is spiraling out of control",https://genius.com/Rittz-spiraling-out-of-control-lyrics
Politically Correct,Put a Crown on It,2019.0,"I can't say this
I'm not allowed to say that either
That might piss somebody off or offend somebody
Fuck it

It's hard for me to talk about shit these days
There's so many rules that I'm supposed to abide by (shh)
Everyone's so sensitive saying not to mention shit
Fuck it I'm about to break the ice down
What should I begin with? Shit I shouldn't mention
Women tryin' to sentence Bill Cosby
Pill or no pill, why the fuck you' in his room, ho?
Should've told him meet you in the hotel lobby
Wait, oh, wait, shit, I'm not allowed to say ""ho""
You ain't got to fuck, say ""no, bitch"" damn
A bitch blackmailed me once
Guarantee when I see her, I'm goin' beat her like a grown-ass man
You can smack hoes, that so? Really, since when?
R. Kelly's situation is a bit taboo
Like a sixth grade me skipping class with a chick, saw my first pair of tits at school

I guess nowadays you supposed to be politically correct
I hope you hear this song and you get physically upset
I'm joking and poking fun, that' because you tickled me to death
I'm just playing, I just hate that they get way too sensitive

Cunt, can't say the c-word, can't say the b-word, can't say the n-word, maybe you can (nah)
If you hang with some friends that okay it if you say it with the a on the end (not cool, dawg)
There's a major percentage of fat white chicks who like black guy dick
Problem is that's the only type of hoes I can get (I can't feel shit)
A pussy hole so stretched out I don't feel shit
But she try to blame it all on my dick
Bitch, hold up relax, I'm just saying what you won't
Really, most of us feel the same way
And don't even act like you don't get a tad bit afraid like a terrorist was on the same plane
But I can't talk religion, diss politicians
Can't even say the word ""retard"" (fuck that )
But imprisoning innocent Mexican children
That's cool 'cause they didn't have a green card?
Geez

I guess nowadays you supposed to be politically correct
I hope you hear this song and you get physically upset
I'm joking and poking fun, that' because you tickled me to death
I'm just playing, I just hate that they get way too sensitive

Cunt you can't even flirt if you're not that attractive
You fuck around and you get charged with harassment (don't touch me)
Even if you got a hard on for it like a cop when he's physically assaulting a black man
There's some unwritten things that you're not allowed to diss, like try it and you'll probably get shun (fuck that)
Some things the majority of people love by default I just don't
Fuck with, here are some
I don't like Mick Jagger or the Rolling Stones (never have)
Truthfully I really hate the Beatles more (their songs suck)
I respect what they did for the culture
Same thing with the Beastie Boys
Your screechy voice just make me mad and so does Breaking Bad, I can't stand bad acting
I couldn't tell you who's in the NFL
A lot of dorks play sports, I don't dick ride athletes
Never been a fan of Orange Is The New Black
These yuppie ass parents and their young ones
And everybody cares 
And I wish you'd shut the fuck up!
Smart mouth brat, really needs to get smacked
Now I got you all mad, what you got a bad temper?
Well, fuck you, fuck your fam, you're confused like a republican transgender
Jesus Christ!

Oh I can't say that?
My bad
I think we can build a wall up to keep all the terrorist from Mexico
And shout out to my best friend OJ Simpson (you can't say that)
I love you OJ (you can't say that either)
And and Donald Trump 2020",https://genius.com/Rittz-politically-correct-lyrics
Geronimo,Jonny Valiant Vol.1: The Mixtape,2011.0,"I been drinking till the bottle's gone
And I'm all alone
So high don't what cloud I'm on
Look out below Geronimo
I'm bout to jump out the window
The time has come
And I gotta go
I told the Lord I'm coming home
Look out below Geronimo
I'm bout to jump out the window

See Jonny says that life is overrated
He says that every day is so monotonous he hate it
He's had a 9 to 5 since '99 and he don't make shit
He lying on his applications saying he graduated
And he blame it on his parents back in the day they separated
Did music in the basement daily he was dedicated
Sedated on you name it but it made him feel creative
He's embarrassed now he feels like he might have wasted
All his time he'll never make it
Growing up he always had a lot of friends
But some just did him dirty others doing as bad as him
Feeling grimm they getting old and can't relive the past again
Wishing that he had some cash to spend
But the only cash he has he has to ration it
His girlfriend is everything she love him
But all they ever do is get drunk on alcohol and
Talk about how they got nothing
I heard him from a couple floors above me
He screaming that he's jumping drunk and singing to his woman

I been drinking till the bottle's gone
And I'm all alone
So high don't what cloud I'm on
Look out below Geronimo
I'm bout to jump out the window
The time has come
And I gotta go
I told the Lord I'm coming home
Look out below Geronimo
I'm bout to jump out the window

See Tanya and her mom don't get along
What makes it even harder Tanya father's always gone
He's never home it's like he's hiding from his family at his job
Instead of coming home right after work
He's spending his time up at the bar
That's why his daughters lost and craving some attention
Feening for it screaming for it won't nobody listen
Started having sex and found a way to get affection
Everyone she slept with says they hit and they didn't use protection
And left when she started to get attached
And all she wants is love it's like her heart is up for grabs
The doctor says she's pregnant but she don't know who's the dad
And he parents kicked her out because they racist
And the baby daddy's black
So now she's shacking up in one of her friends apartments
Drinking while she's pregnant talking about
How cold her heart is from hardships
She look up at the sky sighing why am I alive
I should dive off this balcony she cried

I been drinking till the bottle's gone
And I'm all alone
So high don't what cloud I'm on
Look out below Geronimo
I'm bout to jump out the window
The time has come
And I gotta go
I told the Lord I'm coming home
Look out below Geronimo
I'm bout to jump out the window window window

Whatever you do
I promise that things will get better for you

Day of the Dead,Top of the Line,2016.0,"This rap shit ain't a movie
Online gettin' turned on by a bunch of male groupies
That said they gonna shoot me or do something to me
When they see me them imaginary bullets go through me
Ask anyone who know me in the rap game say that I'm cool
But you should watch how you pursue me
I find it confusing these dudes click on my dick so hard
It's like they grew a coochie, homie you canoeing
Up shit creek, a thick beef stew was brewing
You talk about it so much I wish that you would use your toolie
On yourself, blow your brains out, plus you suck at rappin'
If I was you I would do tattooing, you stupid
Thinkin' I'ma argue with you online
So you could try to get views boo-hooing
Talking shit about me and all I do is keep it cool with motherfuckers
Now I'm startin' to feel the hugest mood swing
If the beef wasn't with me why would you include me?
'Cause it takes a while to text you back?
So many rappers sittin' there trashing
They expect I'm gonna let them have
A feature for free and get so mad because I'm busy and can't do it
Really that's what all this 'bout?
I feel like I got so many enemies I cannot keep count
Even homies I grew up with are mad I blew up and wanna knock me down
But I'm like Rocky Balboa can't count me out
And I ain't dumb I've been around tommy guns before
But I'm not the one to be gunnin' for
And this is karma you started it shut the fuck up country boy
You disrespected me
I ain't tryna' say I've been a G
I'm just me I hate their negative energy
Somebody should've told 'em let me be
This shit is stress relief, the haters rest in peace, cause

It's the day of the dead
Better watch where you're making your bed
Watch where you're layin' your head
Why the fuck would you say what you said about me
Don't try to come around me, nah
It's the day of the dead
Better watch where you're making your bed
Watch where you're layin' your head
Why the fuck would you say what you said about me
Don't bring them dudes around me, nah
Cause I ain't with that bullshit

I cannot relate or understand
A man that goes online to hate another man
Pussy boy they just type away
I'm tryin' hard not to write them a reply, but can't
And all the lames that all rhyme the same
On every record I'm guessing that they ain't musically inclined
They made the kind of statements
Oh, you saying Switch Lanes sound the same
As Heaven and Living the Dream and I could name
A bunch more: Crown Royal, Call 911
You can tell the difference between the flow on Blow and Wishin'
My Interview didn't you listen? I always switch it up
I'm thinking that these drones are slow
And they can't break down rhyme schemes
Heated cause they can't out rhyme me
And I ain't ever changing to try to get signed
And I ain't animating like say I'm Tech N9ne
But If you get me on a feature it's a straight up crime scene
It seems like every year that pass I gotta' remind you
I came through on my debut like make room
Its still the total opposite of shit from my sophomore
And still ain't got a sponsor from Monster
Jumping off the stage to hit a guy that flipped me off at my concert
They call me every name in the book
From white Tech to fat Yelawolf, see a friend jealous look
When they shaking my hand like I can't tell what's good
Cause I can't go and put people on just because, man
Man I wish that I was rich as you was thinking I was
Homies catching feelings acting like a bitch with a grudge
They liked it better when I was broke and depressed with a job
I tour three times a year if you mean what you said
And when you see me in your city tell me face to face
Cause you ain't real just another screen naming lame
Get out your black face paint and pray cause

It's the day of the dead
Better watch where you're making your bed
Watch where you're layin' your head
Why the fuck would you say what you said about me
Don't try to come around me, nah
It's the day of the dead
Better watch where you're making your bed
Watch where you're layin' your head
Why the fuck would you say what you said about me

All Around The World,The Life and Times of Jonny Valiant,2013.0,"All around the world
All around the world

I'm just a kid from the G.C
Who would've thought you would see me
On MTV one day, I done came a long way from printing up CDs
Up in the basement on Cruse Road
Used to do shows with no cameras there
Now I'm doing shit in the House of Blues in LA
On stage a whole crowd is cheering me on
Disappear when we gone
Up in the tour bus on to the next state
The last one was eleven weeks long
Friends saying you made it Rittz
You don't play the shit
Eating dry egg stakes on a Vegas trip
Die hard fans that be showing up
They like, ""Hey, would you please sign my ladies tits?""
I'm like, fine
You can touch them Rittz I don't mind
I say congratulations on your ladies tits
You got pics don’t put em online
Cause my girl might trip out
Me and her we done had a hard time
7 years we ain't never had a dime
Even though it ain't much it, I feel like I'm getting rich now
I just signed a deal so I'm a get it now
I told Tech and Trav I won't let them down
It's an honor to be a part of Strange Music
A label that's down to go to the extra mile
And I could crack a smile without faking it
Cause a few people knew me in the A
Now I got dudes over in the UK
They getting tattoos of my face they know me all...

Man ya gotta understand like...
I'm so grateful to be in the position I'm in, you know
I been, I been doing this shit for 15 years
It took, it took me 15 years to get to this point
It's real shit

All around the world
All around the world
They know me all around the world
All around the world

One time for the homies in Toronto
Fans say that they feel me in Montreal
2 years ago if it wasn't for no bad luck
I'd probably wouldn't have no luck at all
Had to drive my car to do spot days
My piece of junk would stall, not knowing who to call
Shit over heated in Tennessee
Hundred degree weather stranded by Ruby Falls
I'm like no...
Danny Boone, Demun Jones
Help me expand my fan base
When I was dead broke they would throw me some cheese for shows
And that's real
We done stayed in some shitty hotels
Sleeping on top of the covers, wearing socks in the showers
And not knowing if the shit would go well
On stage on the country hall but nobody knew me
Opening for rehab again
5 months later I was on headline
Cheap Jynx Burn One come at me went
Across country fans buyin' tickets just to come see
Me, on my own I ain't had nobody fund me
3 star hotels used to be a luxury
Now we're getting kicked outta' of this for disrupting
Smoking weed, drinking crown
Celebrating Lincoln town
Cars would take us to the after party
Weird I was begging for my pick and out
And I'm blessed but now I gotta go and get more
I was just a kid in Gwinnett with a dream
Tryna' be like Dre and Big Boi
Now they know me all...

Shit, man I'm so lucky man
To be in the position I'm in, you know what I'm saying
You know how many musicians never get discovered
And got talent and shit
I'm getting to live my dream, you know
I just bought a new car and shit
I ain't never had a new car. Yea


Third verse I'm a dedicate to my homies
Slick boy, Chico, freaky freeze
What up Ralo, trans ain't held me down
But thank God they believed in me
My boys mandatory Irish nut
We hit a motherfucker if we start the but
Shortcut name Rittz and kids named me White Jesus
Look what you started bro that's love
Dallas I done finally came up
For the days and back in 9th grade for the football
Game trying to sound like Bone Thugs
And to the friends I miss
Growing up and we had to part ways
We was young and said it would all change
But its still Clintel homie that is always
Pay homage to my rapping friends we're all vulnerable
Praying one day that we get to live our dreams
They told me the talent is valuable
But truthfully timing is everything
It's unfair
That's why I gotta thank my fans
I could be the best rapper alive but without them nobody really give a damn now they know me all...

Thank you. Naw for real, thank you
I mean you could have all the co-sings in the world, you know
But without fans really, really feeling your music
Really liking your shit, you ain't shit
And I'll never forget that, thank you so much

Ain't I so smooth
I know that you like the way I move
When the clock strikes two
I'm gon' have you inside of the groove

Tatted up with my jewelry on, my shoes looking so brand new
Stunting like Mont-Blanc Legend on my clothes
Being broke is a no-can-do
And I still can't lose
My team stay winnin' we can have any girl we can choose
We in the ATL but
We be partying like we in Cancun
Double shots of the Avion with no lime to chase
Bout to wipe the slate clean and ride the wave
I gotta diamond bracelet, designer shades
Suede retro nines, look behind the drapes
When neighbors sleep we was geeked up wide awake
We making money when the clock strikes two
And the kids say Rittz I wish I was like you, ooh
Ain't I so smooth, Yeah

Ain't I so smooth
I know that you like the way I move

I don't rap, I trap
But I look like I rap
Meetin' good dudes cool
Meetin' fake dudes ain't
I play by the rules
A fuck boy I ain't
I ain't with that old sucker shit
Gettin' money is all that I'm familiar with
Diamond clusters all on my fist
Rolex watch cost 46, thow-ow
Used to be broke, now I'm a cash cow
I'm a plug, got the jug in my pack now
Hella love in my hood, smokin' black and mild
Bitch motherfucker I'm smooth

I made a bunch and man I'm bout to celebrate
I prolly should be rockin' somethin' tailor made
They wishin' I would stop but I accelerate
I got a bottle and some molly in the cellophane
Some purple liquid in my cup, no Welch's grape
I got a couple more notches in my belt to make
I gave that bitch my number
I ain't sittin' 'round waitin' for my cell to ring
And this a lost cause
Our squad
Messin' up the room leavin' jaws, bras
Layin' on the floor, leaving' bars, straws
Layin' on the table by the vase, ya'll
Lookin' at me like you seen a star
When I pull up my car everybody like whooo!
Rittz up in this bitch and I'm like true

After Mornin’,Jonny Valiant Vol.1: The Mixtape,2008.0,"Take 85 north to Gwinnett to my stompin' ground
People sleepin' on my county
Now it's time to wake em' up, smell the coffee ground
Bout' to steal the spotlight
Snort snow and I flow, feel the frostbite
We sellin' ice cream, I ain't talking Klondikes
Crystal meth, and it's crystal clear
Reporting live from Gwinnett like I'm Walter Cronkite
So ya'll might wanna keep a pistol near
Devo on the board, hear the engineer
What's the deal, pickle spear? Smoke a hog leg
After that I'ma bounce to the crib with this bitch cause she got my dick stiffer than a frog leg
Have her soundin' like she ball-gagged
Bust a nut then I dip out I'm Jimmy Carter
Motherfuckers wanna look hard from they whip, but 26
I ain't playin' with you kindergartners
It's the infamous Rittz, aka White Jesus
Alias Jonny Valiant
I hope when I come across to you it's on
Cause if you step you'll get tossed like a pasta salad
So, excuse me junior, got a QP in my underwear right next to my huge kahunas
And it's not for sale homie, it's personal
Take a toke and tell me how the purple pull
 brought it through the terminal
My heart's still from the bay, bay, bay all the way to the A, A, A
I'ma take a little hit then I'll do a little yay', yay'
Got the hookup on the customized J's
Everybody look amazed when they checkin' out the footwork
Sayin' who the fuck is Rittz
 and the Cli-N-Tel comin' out the woodwork
Puffin' good herb, yuh uh yeah

I got a cup full of Captain Morgan, a mango blunt wrap filled with kush
Got a gram and a half to snort and my fingernails smell like a ganja bush
I put my Xanax bars in the cellophane
 
and when you givin' me dirty looks
I'ma wash it down with this Captain Morgan,
 the party don't stop till After Mornin' (x2)

All the ladies in the crowd raise your hand if you're tired of your man and you wish you had something new
Ok, I see a couple few. You, you, you, too suddenly the number grew now listen
All the girls with their hands in the air that is tired of their man wantin' somethin' new
Congrats girl, you're invited backstage, afterwords you can fuck my crew
It feels like Utopia, we livin' la vida coca, man
I feel the line slide down my throat and drain, then chase it with a Crown and Coke
Till my body's floatin' like a big banana boat
Try to kill my high and I'ma split your cantaloupe right in half like a nut shell
Tell the cops that you got drunk, fell, tried to run somewhere that's the reason for the motherfuckin' blood trail ""Rittz, just chill""
I'll be in an all black presidential Caddy '06 DeVille
Still with the original wheels smokin' pure kush, shit
""What's your name there white boy?"" George Bush, bitch
 it's neon green
I had it in my pocket, you can smell it on my Shean John jeans
My Sean John jeans, eyes chinkin' like a Chinese ping pong team
Now I'm off tryin' to find me a ding-dong fiend with a drug habit
Got some porn star E pills
I'mma take her to the crib, get her freaky as fuck
And when tomorrow comes around, tell my boys the details
Some say I go overboard, and the thought that my heart might explode before
When my nose was sore, I just smoked some more
When my lungs are done, there's somethin' cold to pour

I got a cup full of Captain Morgan, a mango blunt wrap filled with kush
Got a gram and a half to snort and my fingernails smell like a ganja bush

Paradise,White Jesus Revival,2012.0,"It must be Paradise
Riding in my old school underneath the city sky
And I'm so gone
My mind is paralyzed
Drinking while my pinky ring is blinging off the city lights
Yea paradise

Old school Montecarlo fuck a foreign whip
Speakers knock knocking in the trunk and my joint is lit
And what I got is on my job some exotic I'm just happy I can finally afford this shit
My kicks still brand new cuz i move with ease
LRG Denim with the Diamond tee
Bumping Big K.R.I.T in my time machine
My chain hanging from my neck like a tire swing
No use admiring me
Bet I'll pass you by by the time you blink
I've been trying to strive for the finer things
I wanna fuck get high and drink until I hear the fat lady and the choir sing
I've been acquiring expensive tastes
Taking vacations to private beaches
On tour in Destin Florida
On a Georgia beach, drinking pomegranate margaritas
I'm in Chattanooga
Hit New Orleans
Broke up home, growing down in Austin Texas
Fuck mimosas, drinking crown and coke
Poached eggs and filet mignon for breakfast
You can send me a text but don't expect a reply
I'm too busy to talk so now my voicemail full
Then it's back to the ATL
Hit the mall then all my homeboys fell through
Then we threw a couple dollars at the hoes on the pole got to go because I know I'll spend up all my bread
Back home to my centerfold dinner roll pussy wishin me and her crawl in bed
And we could spoon
Til about noon
Watching episodes of the Sopranos
Turn the T.V. off
Put on Stevie Wonder
Fuck her to the sound of the piano
It must be paradise

It must be Paradise
Riding in my old school underneath the city sky
And I'm so gone
My mind is paralyzed
Drinking while my pinky ring is blinging off the city lights
Yea paradise

No more hourly wages washing pots and pans
No more feeling embarrassed wearing this uniform trying to find a place to wash my hands
I'm really hoping that nobody in the store recognized me
Changing my clothes in a bathroom stall I got a call it's my manager
He said ""dog, Wolf wants you at the radio station"" just great I'm late
I missed out he had to do his shit without me
Funny how we was talking about quitting last year and giving up on the wildest dream
But this year I'm seeing a different outcoming
I'm looking down on my balcony I see hoes
I see gold
Casinoes
I see hoes
And free clothes
Oh what these, you ain't never seen those
I used to be broke my pockets on beanpole
Now the world looks brighter to me when I'm looking out of the peephole
I see palm tree gazebos
The same paint in the streets of Greensboro
Just got cooked of people calling me gringo
Domingo
Everything started to make sense
I wish that I could shake the hand
Of every fan
Who ever bought my shit and showed love to me thanks again cause this must be paradise

It must be Paradise
Riding in my old school underneath the city sky
And I'm so gone
My mind is paralyzed
Drinking while my pinky ring is blinging off the city lights

She was so upset 'cause I had to go to work
We ain't got to spend much time together lately 'cause the rap was finally taking off, I had to put it first
My boss said one of us can take off early
I was like ""me please"" 'cause I wanted to surprise – her
So I drove to her job, turned my lights off in the parking lot 'cause she was getting off at 5
My stomach giddied out when she came outside
She was walking with a guy, laughing and something didn't seem – right
And when she noticed me she looked like she was busted doing something
Tryna kiss me, I said ""who the fuck is he?"" – my gut
Feeling was killing me, I couldn't even eat
'Cause I felt like she was hiding shit, I couldn't let it go
I asked her one more time ""is there something going on between you and him?""
She looked at me and told me ""I don't know!""
""You don't know?! What the fuck you mean? You've been cheating on me?""
She admitted her and him had kissed, crying
Telling me that all I do is spend my time writing, working nights, neglecting her, she don't love me like she did
Well the last 5 years were for nothing
Yeah we struggled but we loved each other now it's coming to a sudden end
Fighting, tryna move my furniture up out of momma's crib
Pack my shit, kiss our dog on the head then I left and I felt like
Death

One day everything that I ever loved was gone
It all got stripped away
So now I'm crying inside and I wish I could turn the time
Back to yesterday
Let's go back to yesterday
Let's go back to yesterday

Stayin' in the basement of my mom and dad's
Staring at her Facebook, every pictures that she posts
Every comment, tryna' see if she gon' call me back on an over lonely heart
My mama said it's gonna pass playing 80's music back to back, Johnny Hates Jazz ""Shattered Dreams""
How am I supposed to live without you?
When I've been loving you so long
She already sending kisses, I wonder if she's started fucking him or not I bet you
I sent her texts saying ""I miss you"", she don't write back
I know I shouldn't but at night I like to ride past
The house I used to call ours yeah my name's still on the bills
Scared to switch 'em thinking there's a slight chance
That she's just going through a faze we'll get back together soon
But it's 2 a.m., I wonder where her car is
And how the dog is
I wish I could go inside and pet him
I never thought that you would ever do me wrong, bitch!
I need to calm down, sadness turn to anger
Xanax putting me into a deep depression
All I can do is wait now, shit I almost had a break down
Up at Tree Sound, we was mixing Wishin'
White Jesus just dropped everything I dreamed about when I was younger is coming true while I'm in this position
It's like my life is finally supposed to be the shit but isn't chewing on the barrel of my pistol
Never visioned that this bitch would do me like this

One day everything that I ever loved was gone
It all got stripped away
So now I'm crying inside and I wish I could turn the time
Back to yesterday
Let's go back to yesterday
Let's go back to yesterday

True Love:
True Love is counted by the health, well-being and happiness to another person to a greater degree than your own health and well-being and happiness
When you care for your saying of words, thoughts and actions, that’s specifically how you figure out a person. Your love
A Soulmate:
A soulmate is a person who’s perfectly suited to another person’s temperament
A person who strongly resembles another person in their attitude and belief
A close friend who completely understands them
A person who has the same beliefs and opinions as another person
A Douchebag:
A douchebag is someone who reads slow  at the end of a song
Just rinse the douchebag nozzle in warm water after using it
Let the douchebag dry completely, use twice a day
One day

One day everything that I ever loved was gone
It all got stripped away
So now I'm crying inside and I wish I could turn the time

Press Rewind,Last Call,2017.0,"I was just a kid from a small town west of Pennsylvania
'88 moved down to GA, overwhelmed by the change
I got treated like stranger 'cause I didn't fit in
Had a mullet, getting made fun of by the other kids
My brother wasn't in the same school to protect me
6th grade, every day they would jump me in the gym
Finally got a couple friends
I was in and out of phases, into heavy metal for a stint
Then I started singing Boyz II Men
Playing Poison Clan
Really I just wanna be like them
So I went and brought a gun
In the school to be cool
Wasn't real but it looked like one
It was chrome but this kid Trovon
Took it from me, making dudes take they shoes off
When he got caught better say it ain't mine
He said he wouldn't tell
I was in the office when they rung the bell
I had to go to panel and probably get expelled
I knew I had to answer to my father I was scared
He was known for raising hell
Hit me with an open hand or he whipped me with a belt but today was something else
Quiet on the ride home when we got into the house
I got swung into the shelf
Getting swung on, I was 12 tryna
Hide my face
Ditching uppercuts from my dad's punches making
My nose bleed
With my sister and her neighbor friend watching, momma
Cry, but she
Knew it was one of many ass whoopings coming
I received
Can't hit the back button

There’s a pain way down
That’s been trapped inside
Let the pain drain out
Left the past behind
But sometimes my mind
Press rewind

'95 was the best year of my life that's without a question
My brother was a senior and I was just a freshman
He would let me hang out with his friends and
Life felt normal for once
But the happiness I had only lasted a second
Mom and Dad separated same year, so my brother moved away when we finally had our friendship
Made a lot of friends with kids in the same boat
No male role models for us to observe and be our guide
Dropped out of school, hit a learning curve, relied
On each other trying to persevere in life
Insecurities are high
Feeling unloved, searching for a girl that can provide
She wanna take it further, I'm worried that I'm gonna blow my cover 'cause I said I'm not a virgin and I lied
I finally fertilized
Then she left me for another guy
But years flying by, life is like a circus ride
We done did the worst, too much dirt to purify
Mom was working nights
Helicopters circling outside
Lot of murders, lot of fights
Lot of nights heard the cries from my mom's room
Household with no one in control
Everything crumbled, I was young but now I'm grown
Suddenly my brother and my father coming home
And it's
So unreal
When we're all together you can feel the tension and it's
Unfair
Started fighting at my brother's college graduation but it
Goes unsaid
When you love each other ain't no conversation, hated
All those years
Wishing I could erase them

There's a pain way down
That's been trapped inside
Let the pain drain out
Left the past behind
But sometimes my mind...

Crash and Burn,Last Call,2017.0,"My homie and his girl just had a kid
They debated keeping it at first but now they're glad they did
People doubting he's a daddy, but he adamant he is
Both of them cheated round the time that she conceived it, he believing that it's his
His family tell him take a test so we'll be sure
But that just pissed him off, so he side with his baby momma more
He could see himself inside the baby's eyes, it bring him joy
Plus they was on the verge of breaking up
They thought the pregnancy would be the cure to stay together
But instead it was the last straw
She's crying saying that they need to talk
She told him that her ex took a test, he's the daddy of the baby
Now he got a broken heart up in the car

He's on the road now
Feeling zoned out
Need to slow down
'Cause you're going full speed ahead
Swerving on the road now
Feeling zoned out
Need to slow down
'Cause you're going full speed ahead
'Bout to crash and burn

She was just a teen when dad got busted cheating, parents got divorced
Mom done lost her voice from crying so much, lots of shock, absorbed
Family structure crumbled. Lost support
Used to talk about college courses with her dad while watching sports
Now he just honks the horn and leaves , the peace done got restored
He just chops the doors, split the family up in pieces, tears are seeping through the carpet floor
Mom ain't home to watch and lock the doors
One time she lost it when she caught some boys inside her daughter's closet in their boxer shorts
She could discipline her, when she tried her daughter fought her
She blamed her, saying she's the reason she don't got a father
She's always on the bottle, drunk when momma called the police
'Cause she slapped and snatched the cash up out her purse and stole her keys

She's on the road now
Feeling zoned out
Need to slow down
'Cause you're going full speed ahead
Swerving on the road now
Feeling zoned out
Need to slow down
'Cause you're going full speed ahead
'Bout to crash and burn

He's an entertainer , yeah , it beats a nine to five
Sometimes he's scared there'll be a day when he runs out of rhymes
Sick of having to repeat himself a thousand times
But be careful you'll get eaten, these are mountain lions surrounded by
These wolves ,only dressed like sheep
Some people whoop when I lit my dream
But I still ain't rich, I don't got a plan B
Get the fans and then I cop
Jump ship, I sink
So I gotta hit the road, only way to get paid
So my lady at home gotta patiently wait
She's afraid when I'm gone ,gotta pray I'm okay
How much more can I take from the fame and the stage

I'm on the road now
Feeling zoned out
Need to slow down
'Cause you're going full speed ahead
Swerving on the road now
Feeling zoned out
Need to slow down
'Cause you're going full speed ahead
'Bout to crash and burn

And do you have to learn
Before you have returned
Beneath the grass and dirt
Besides the casket/urns
We'll put your ashes first
Come bring you back to Earth
Before you crash and burn",https://genius.com/Rittz-crash-and-burn-lyrics
Into the Sky,Last Call,2017.0,"It's been
Five years in a row, I still won't quit
Fuck the recognition people still don't give
And the retro 8's with the strap unfastened
And my shoestrings tucked to the Velcro strip
I don't battle rap and I ain't on the shell toe tip
Looking like I'm moving dope, but I don't sell no bricks
Up inside the Regal, you can run and play The Seagulls
See me leaning out the window with the elbow bent
Try to bring a German Shepherd, they don't smell no scent
Won't see no seeds, don't spill no stems
Got a L-O-N-G beast in the streets
CNT is a team it's a fellowship
I ain't ever been to jail, I don't tell no fibs
Any time they ever try me is a failed attempt
I don't ever wanna catch a L, I win
Bitches tryna find out what hotel I'm in
I'll be better when, I'm finally off the road
Any baggage, I'ma leave it with the bellhop
Shell-shocked when I came home 'til I see a big check
When I'm peeking in the mailbox
80 bags of  the stash that I had
As I brag to my homie in the jailhouse
I can help now, when you get out I'll be well off
Haters say hell nah

Bitch don't even try-y-y-y-y
'Cause that ain't gonna fly-y-y-y-y
They say that I'm on fi-i-i-i-ire
And I don't even li-i-i-i-ie
I'ma look 'em in the eye, put a middle finger up
Put a middle finger up, put a middle finger up
Into the sky-y-y-y-y
Put a middle finger up, put a middle finger up
Into the sky-y-y-y-y
Put a middle finger up, put a middle finger up
Into the sky-y-y-y-y
Put a middle finger up, put a middle finger up into the sky

Some of y'all might hate this cadence
Mad 'cause obtained the taste sensation
Starving like all I ever ate was Ramen
Your favorite entertainer okay with stagin'
Ballin' when they having trouble making payments
Thought that they could draw, but they were tracing faces
People that you place your faith in are faking
Like alien invasions, lasers, ray guns
Brag about your money and your company
If someone doesn't want it, they be jumping like a bullfrog
Now you gotta prove all the shit that you was talking
You a poodle in a saloon full of bulldogs
Got a dot on your head from the blue chalk
On the cue ball, in the pool hall
No reality show when you leave Fulton County
You ain't calling no shots like Too Tall
Hit you when they pull off
Now the family gotta tell 'em too-da-loo
All that I can say is c'est la vie
True, I got a little loot
I try not to rub it in they face when I make my cheese
A few times I done seen a few guys showing they cahoonas
Thinking they was paid like me
Pull up in a new car, you ain't got no money in the bank like me
So –

Bitch don't even try-y-y-y-y
'Cause that ain't gonna fly-y-y-y-y
They say that I'm on fi-i-i-i-ire
And I don't even li-i-i-i-ie
I'ma look 'em in the eye, put a middle finger up
Put a middle finger up, put a middle finger up
Into the sky-y-y-y-y
Put a middle finger up, put a middle finger up
Into the sky-y-y-y-y
Put a middle finger up, put a middle finger up

As You Are,UnKnown,2018.0,"I’m a lover gotta hand it to her
She was by my side when I had a 9 to 5
Ever since I blew up
I’ve been all around the world, ain't no girl I’ve ever seen can hold a candle to her
She be on my Instagram viewing my comments
Trippin’ on females, I holla, “It’d be hell without her.”
Tear my heart out
Now my bodies like an empty seashell, I’m hollow
Both dread tomorrow
I’ve gotta leave for tour and I ain’t gonna be home for months
We both lovers on a lonely heart
But she’s scared that I’m gonna find a girl on the road that I want a little more than her
But that couldn’t be more absurd
We get drunk and have a war of words and wake up in the mornin’ and make up
The more I’m away from it, the more it hurts
But she still can’t ignore the girls and all the comments written
Told her, “Its not even a competition.”
But if we switched our positions I could see where she’s coming from and comprehend it
Hopin’ God’ll listen
Please let her know I love and miss her
While I’m laying here praying in the bed alone
Ain’t no girl in the world that ????
So please let me know that...

Let me love you as you are (I love you)
Let me love you as you ??
The crude drink of the heart
The crude drink of the heart

She say she need to loose weight
I tell her that I think she looks great
She put fake eyelashes on
But without them her eyes could be mesmerized
She want to exercise tell me she ??? in good shape
She looks straight in my eyes tryna’ see if I’m lyin’ or sayin’ what I think she wants to hear
The truth is I love her with no makeup
Wish I had a paintbrush
Natural beauty’s rare
She’s not the girl with the pearl ear ring in the portrait
Funny cause she’s gorgeous too
Even when she’s asleep
But she snores, it’s cute
I wake up in the morning and enjoy the view
Sometimes she gets insecure, envious of the girls on the TV set
Asking me trick questions like, “If you had a chance would you ever leave me for them?”
And I just keep pretending like I didn’t hear what she asked
But if you wanna know what I would do
We’re two peas in a pod
I could have any female alive, that’s a really hard one to choose
I’m just playin’
The only girl I want is you
We could laugh all day ‘bout something stupid
We can finish each other’s sentences
When we spend a minute a part, it’s hard to do
There’s nothing not to prove and it’s the honest truth that (I love you)",https://genius.com/Rittz-as-you-are-lyrics
Diamonds and Gold,Top of the Line,2016.0,"I guess them pretty blue skies up in Gwinnett County got a disguise
I guess your eyes see us on that map and make you think we ain't a trap
But I'm from that North, N-A-W-F
North Atlanta, we for real

85 north of Atlanta, home of the Gwinnett County Braves
Out-of-towners looking out of place 'round here
Think it's sweet and disappear without a trace
Cops on the dash see the plates out of state
Apartment complex got a gate but it ain't
Safe tryna hustle 'round here think there's money to be made
You'll get robbed by somebody underage
We don't rock brands like Vans, only J's
We don't use words like ""hella"" or ""the bomb""
So many celebs that live in Gwinnett
Tryna say downtown when they tell you where they from
Me, I'm from the 'burbs, never had much, I'm
White boy in black Hollywood representing Slum
Yeah, I got long hair, I ain't ZZ Top
I got diamonds on my pinky ring and diamonds on my charm
I'm incredible like Burt Wonderstone
Hurts when its done
Wanna battle me and you'll get murked one-on-one
We ain't on no battle rap
We used to rap about our habitat and all the work that we done
Camaro convertible, turbo, we're there with the purple
We stand in a circle and puff
Got these bitches they go twerking and sucking
If you ain't got 'em fucking then you probably ain't assertive enough
Make your girl have a crush and I'm far from a heartthrob
Middle finger up saying fuck Paul Blart
Cops got the K9 in the car lot
Someone just got shot up at the Marriott Courtyard
Sitting in the car shot
People scheming to get Lamborghini money
They ain't tryna drive a Dodge Dart
Drug deal gone bad up at Wal-Mart
Better pay attention when you're pitching in the ballpark
'Cause

These streets can be misleading, and this one thing I know
Don't come around here flexin', I suggest you slow your roll
Tryna show off all your diamonds and gold
They gon' get you for your diamonds and gold
Everybody want some diamonds and gold
And I'm dying for your diamonds and gold
I know in Georgia, shit ain't peachy, so fuck what you've been told
'Cause when this shit get greezy, we've been known to go for broke
Tryna show off all your diamonds and gold
They gon' get you for your diamonds and gold
Everybody want some diamonds and gold
And I'm dying for your diamonds and gold
Woah

From a middle class neighborhood
From '94 to '05, I was up in Eagle Point then
A lot of people wasn't born here
Moving in and out, never know who the neighbor next door is
Drug dealers tryna build clientele
So they telling everybody they got it, that shit was short-lived
Jack boys get word, kick your door in
Duct tape you on the floor, pistol-whip your girlfriend
Hit a lick for four grand, now they got some cash to flaunt
In high school, used lame kids to practice on
Made 'em empty out their pockets
Other kids dreaming of being astronauts
We were scheming to make a profit
The gun that's underneath the mattress drawn
Make it a chance of living half as long
A lot of homies from the past is gone
You wanna play games? Better train for the triathlon
'Cause ain't no games round here, ho
We ain't in no dorm room playing beer pong
Homies never made it into the millennium
Never forget 'em sheddin' tattoo tears for 'em
Adam got a life sentence, he in Dooly State Prison
Send him money, if he need me then I'm here for him
We done smoked so much weed, smoking weed ain't shit
Doing any hard drugs we could get our hands on
Man down, he was clean, started fucking with that meth again
It wouldn't be GC without Mexicans
Claiming turf, gang signs spray painted on the picket fence
They gotta represent what set they in
Back in the day it was Breckinridge, Crescent Lake
Sweetwater, Saratoga, and The Falls just to name a few
So watch the lane you choose, and who you bragging to
'Cause you gon' end up getting robbed in the North

These streets can be misleading, and this one thing I know
Don't come around here flexin', I suggest you slow your roll
Tryna show off all your diamonds and gold
They gon' get you for your diamonds and gold
Everybody want some diamonds and gold
And I'm dying for your diamonds and gold
I know in Georgia, shit ain't peachy, so fuck what you've been told
'Cause when this shit get greezy, we've been known to go for broke
Tryna show off all your diamonds and gold
They gon' get you for your diamonds and gold
Everybody want some diamonds and gold
And I'm dying for your diamonds and gold
Woah

We got a young nigga playing with that dope again
I'm in the kitchen on that Adderall, focusing
I'm on the road, doing shows, with some hoes again
I hit the gas a couple times, then I hold it in
I'm in the street with the heat on the seat
In case I bump into police or I run into my foes again
'Cause I hear them niggas tripping 'bout the flavor that I'm kicking
And I'm down to start messing with the gold, you see
I been breaking down pounds on them Lortab 10's
On a bar and a half, and I'm going back in
If you ever see a foreign car sliding on rims
Up 85 North  that's him
Just drive, I see him, I see him, I see him
All black tint, nigga riding Nigerian
All white paint, we gon' call it Siberian
Loud pack on him, he ain't no librarian
Up from Mexico City, that's that Norcross area
Whole lot of killers gon' need a pallbearer
Drinking on brown, got you feeling barbaric
Still got a trap spot right on Harrington
Still got a trap spot, trappin' on Jimmy
I'ma dump the whole clip til it run empty
And my license expired, tell Rittz to come get me
We the only ones got a key to this city
My lawyer's suppressing the evidence
I had some dope in my residence
I had some guns in my residence
I would not tell on no Mexican, I would not tell on no Mexican!
They can indict it, I'll fight it, I swear to that
Shorty don't like me, I'm piping, I'm arrogant
Gambino boss on the North and I carry it
We got Mariah, you buying, I'm selling it
Tell 'em Rittz

These streets can be misleading, and this one thing I know
Don't come around here flexin', I suggest you slow your roll
Tryna show off all your diamonds and gold
They gon' get you for your diamonds and gold
Everybody want some diamonds and gold
And I'm dying for your diamonds and gold

Never Lettin Go,The Life and Times of Jonny Valiant,2013.0,"1995, I saw my first friend
Get buried in the ground; we was traumatized
We was just smokin' out up at Timmy's crib
Now we at his funeral and his momma cry
I got two years and then Charles died
Both of 'em gone from a homicide
All of sudden murder wasn't so uncommon
The innocence that we had was gone inside
Before we quit high school, selling drugs was cool
Now all of sudden hittin' licks for the drugs was in
My close homeboys from the robbin' crew
Put me in the middle stickin' up my friends
No wonder why nobody didn't trust me when
The door busted in, they tied up and gagged
And the guy with the gun that's behind a mask
Is some dude you used to sit behind in class
Let's ask hoodie guy a bunch of time he had
To sit down, found guilty, his youth was stripped
He called me collect when we ususally spit
A bunch of dope ass rap, cause the music shit's
The only future that boosted our optimism
But the time was ticking as we lose our grip
Years of boozin', and usin', abusin' drugs'll
Prove you on how we used to live in this...

The street life, those street lights
Don't seem bright no more
The devil's got a hold of ya soul
And he's pulling you below (*Humming*)
Caught up in this street life, those street lights
Don't seem bright no more
The devil's got a hold of ya soul
And he's never lettin' go (*Humming*)

Back in the day she was kinda fine
But drugs took a toll on her pretty face
That along with hard times combined
These days you'll find her website online
She quit stripping and now she gettin' paid to escort
It's fucked up she was the girl from next door
Now you can see her ad right next to sex toys
And all you gotta do is hit the local sex store
It made a lot of people lose respect for her
But check yourself cause only God can judge her
She blamed her family her step-father touched her
She tried to tell her mom but her mom's to drunk to
Really give a fuck and the thought disgusts her
She sat back and watched her daughter suffer
So her trust in love and life lost it's luster
Anyway I hope you rocked a rubber
If you fucked her though
'Cause shit gets thick like the fur on the neck of a buffalo
When you piss and your dickhead hurts
But you gotta let it burn like an Usher song
And try to play it off like nothing's wrong
I know it won't be long
I see my homie Scoob and said he said ""What ya know?""
He said that you gotta reap what you sow
So many people try to swim against the undertow in this...


We was young and dumb and full of bad ideas (bad ideas)
So for the past five years (past five years)
I be looking back like, ""Shit! How the fuck I make it?""
I'm just glad I did (glad I did)
Slick called me up and told me, ""Black got killed,""
I was like, ""For real dawg?"" in disbelief
Somebody shot him up a couple years back, he lived
Now he's gone for good I pray he rest in peace
It's terrible knowin' that you will never see
Your friend's face again
I guess that's why protection is a necessity
You can expect to see your life expectancy be that long
When you let the streets become your second home
They ain't have a choice; accept your role
Hoping that they get to see the next episode
Someone'll shoot you in the head and won't sweat it
They cold-blooded never lose a wink of sleep
And the cops don't care neither it's squat to them
Your dead body's just another crime scene to sweep
And I ain't never been a gangsta but thanks to Gwinnett
Growing up I done seen some things
I just hope that the friends that I named in this song
Are watching over with their angel wings while we livin' this...
Street life!

Northside Atlanta ambassador, back for more
The second I see 'em mash record
I’m spazzin' on 'em if they’re askin' for it
The first to put it on the map, so don’t be actin like I passed the torch
Ain’t got the patience for the back and forth
The murder rap has got me on a wanted poster with a cash reward
I’m short tempered, these boys better be glad I’m on
When I was young, I would jack you for your pack of ‘ports
They know me at the local package store, they give me discounts
Thirty minutes out from Midtown, where we sip Crown Royal
Someone swole, they get drunk and run they big mouth
Then somebody punch 'em, they unconscious for the ten count
This rap game is similar to being back in school again 'cause
All my crew is in the building and the in-crowd
It’s cool to be lame nowadays, so excuse me if my attitude is
Who the fuck are you to say what’s in style?
Red 'fro retro, Atlanta got the red look
I be turning heads everywhere you see me step foot
Check stub full of commas, told you I was next up
Rollin' through Gwinnet I hit up both and now we're thista
Made a play on Pleasant Hill rolling through Sonesta
Phone ringing, I don’t answer so they blow my text up
Going the speed limit, police are eager to arrest you
Plus I had a lot of drank, I’d probably fail the breath-a
Lyzer test, change it up, I’m back to rhyming I confess
I think I’m the best , besides a couple guys alive or dead
Running over rivals, tire tread
Their entire head busts just like a virus spreading virally and I infect
Non-believers, fighting like a fly inside my spider web
Tell them give me my respect, climbing up a flight of stairs
Finessin' rhyming since the first Vanilla Ice was said
Ain’t nobody try me yet, I just pray to God I said

Forgive them for their sins, my lord
They know not what they do
I’ve been trying to ignore the things they say to ruin my mood
Never know what I’ve been going through lately if they only knew
They’d watch the shit they say before they make me lose my cool...
Fuck around and lose my cool...

Deep in the hood, in the city, waiting for hours trying to do a song
You hit the stage, you could tell they wanna boo you off
Before you even get started you gotta prove 'em wrong
Or say fuck 'em, my chain tuck 'em, my jewelry on
Go head pull your gun, I hope you’re shooting to kill
The few screws that I have inside my head already loose
Go head shoot me, I’m suicidal, I’d do it myself
I might have got a record deal 'cause I rap good
But before you ever heard of me I earned my respect
I kept it cool with people, some were scared to come to my crib
Stories going around Gwinnett about the ones who got the gas
Wolf, by the cash door
Blaming me for what my boys did, Moreland oh nab bind over Jorlan, Homie Rj’s shortin' them for dollar bills
People pullin' pistols on me saying who this white boy is
And I ain’t saying this to try and be hard, but I ain’t fought no games
Don’t believe me had some boys act strange
They done toured with me, can be sure
That they knew if someone pissed me off, I’d swang 98
Homie shot a lady and a baby, point blank range
And he set 'em on fire in the trunk of a car
My best friend in sixth grade killed a lady for nothing
Now he’s a manager at Denny’s, Servers call him the The Boss
The point I’m tryna get across is I got a heart
I don’t wanna harm anyone, but I’ma finish what they start
Got an emptiness and dark side in me 'cause I’m scarred
People start to think you’re soft, when you’re caught without your guard
Thinking you’re an entertainer and the odds are getting got
Talking shit ain’t gonna happen, get the addy where you are
Pull up on you with the crew pull your car
Fuck a fade, we’re gonna stomp you like we’re putting out a fire
Pray to God like

Forgive them for their sins, my lord
They know not what they do
I’ve been trying to ignore the things they say to ruin my mood
Never know what I’ve been going through lately if they only knew
They’d watch the shit they say before they make me lose my cool...
Fuck around and lose my cool...

Sound Check,Put a Crown on It,2019.0,"Verse 1:
Brand new deal, gasoline soaked in my shoes till I ran through financial hell
Gotta play the hand I’m dealt, someone tell the fans I’m well
Had a dream that I can’t fulfill, throw the middle finger up when they hand out L’s
Last time I was this broke, I was selling shit coke on a handheld scale
Well I’m back on my feet I don’t have no chill, hidden compartment inside my Batmobile
Some of Colorado’s finest, but it’s vacuum sealed
Tell them bring the canine, it don’t have no smell
On the  back wheelwell  lay tracks, wheels peel like the skin on a tattooed heel
Johnny’s back, who else it’s Rittz, you ain’t heard of me you late like a passed thru bill
Dumb bitch, just quit it, you probably heard me on a track with someone you’re familiar with
And I committed murder but I’m sure for whatever reason you said he was better
You want to lie to them to strip me of my credit , forget it
Cuz trying to impress you was a headache, pathetic looking at the MCs on the list
Shit to me there’s only three of them I think are the best
And the others in the industry are equal or less and that’s Jay, Em, Dre 3K(Andre 3000)
These days we play kid shit, we don’t care about skills
Sounding like another rapper that’s already out never was allowed
Hanging around me stealing ideas, making up fake stories like it’s Paramount Films
Fuck the mainstream cuz I’m here for my fans
You can hate I don’t give a god damn, pullin up while they stare at my rims and
Hook:
I love it (I love it) , they hate me ( they hate me)
Unwanted, but it’s clear I ain’t goin anywhere
They hate me ( they hate me) and I love it (I love it)
But don’t fuck with me, trust me I am fully prepared
They know, they knooow I’m a loaded loose cannon and I might explode
I hope they knooow I don’t battle rap I’ll smack you with the microphone like
Sound check
Jelly Roll verse:
They claim to do work, ain’t touched a tool yet
They ain’t did shit to bust a cool sweat
As far as real dudes, there’s just a few left
The fully loaded nine’s playin’ Russian Roulette
I’ve been dealin’ with hatred, dealin’ with fake shit
Man, I’ve dealin’ with a whole lot of snake shit
Somedays I feel like I’m still in the matrix
I’m still spittin’ crack like I’m still in the basement
Everybody knows I’m a ticking time bomb
This is soundcheck, is this mic on?
Rolled up dollar bill, till that  ?
Lionel Ritchie, baby, this all night long
I’m all right bitch, y’all quit asking
I ain’t got shit for y’all bitch asses
With all my heart, say it with all my passion
I’m not no film ho,but I’m all action
I don’t even know what I should say no more
I don’t wanna feel this pain no more
When I don’t wanna play the game no more
I’ma leave on top like Andre Ward
Tell the man get out, straight to the penthouse
One thing I ain’t never been, baby that’s a sit out
Everybody in the city knows how I get down
God damn grenade with the motherfucking pin out
Hook:
I love it (I love it) , they hate me ( they hate me)
Unwanted, but it’s clear I ain’t goin anywhere

This is Jezebel in Hell
I wanna kill you
I wanna blow you, away
I wanna kill you
I wanna blow you, away

Ya Uh, Ya Uh Yeah
(Jonny, Angry Jonny...)

We been together like forever crying everytime I reminisce
Remembering how happy we was, sadly it's been a minute since
I look at you I see the man I miss
You changed so much over the years it's like there's barely a resemblance
Of who we used to be, I never thought that you'd be physically abusin'
I wish I knew how bad your temper was
When I met you I'd of left you but instead you acted like you never hit me
On several different instances
You get belligerent the other night I couldn't breathe
Had me pinned against the wall cause I received some instant messages
And I don't even know that guy, plus I would never cheat
I caught you cheatin' on me once but I was scared to leave
I can't believe I told you yes when you said ""marry me""
You used to cheerish me I think you need to see some therapy
Hystericaly I wake up in the morning cryin'
Horrified I'm going blind couldn't see the warning sign
Comin' Jonny

Jonny, Angry Jonny...
This is Jezebel in Hell
I wanna kill you
I wanna blow you, away
I wanna kill you
I wanna blow you, away

Ya Uh, Ya Uh Yeah
(Jonny, Angry Jonny...)

Getting sick of putting up with this shit
It's bad enough you used to slap me now everytime
That we have a spat you clutching your fists you hit me like I'm a man
Black and blue, trying to mask it with make up and sunglasses
Going to work telling my boss that I slipped
You say I'm not allowed to talk to my friends
Like I'm a prisoner, if I was to mention getting divorced I'd be dead
I know it
I should have fled or filed for a restraining order, it's torture
You pushed me when I was going down the steps
To reassure if I left you that I'd regret it for good
You stood above me, yelling at me, on the floor while I bled
Being forced into sex when the thought of fucking you just makes me cringe
So bad it's getting hard for me to play pretend
Self-esteem so low that I can go get naked in a mirror and see myself as I add up all the days I spent
Telling lies inside a hospital
I bet they wonder why I never called the cops on you
Cause I love you Jonny

Jonny, Angry Jonny...
This is Jezebel in Hell
I wanna kill you
I wanna blow you, away
I wanna kill you
I wanna blow you, away

Jonny, Angry Jonny...

This was never the way I wanted to live
I never thought that this would come to an end
And if it did I figured I would be the one that be dead
I begged you not to buy that gun but you did
I bet you wished you never showed me where you had it hid up under the bed
Everytime you pulled it out when you were drunk I was scared
You use it on me, I finally had enough of your shit
And your demons no more bleedin' no more mistreatin' me cheatin' repeatedly, me pleading to stop beating me
Jesus I gave you everything you wanted all I wanted back
Was your love but really I was just your punching bag
And if I go to hell for killing you I'm willing to
I feel like you done already took me to hell and back Jonny
And I can tell I caught you by surprise
From the expression in your lifeless eyes
Say my goodbyes to my one and only
While I'm standing in the puddle by your bloody body
I love you Jonny",https://genius.com/Rittz-angry-jonny-lyrics
Morning Till the Nightfall,Dominion,2017.0,"Ya-uh-yeah
I feel so good
Yeah, let's go

We ain't rockin' no 
shell toes
Fly Giuseppes, got brimstones on my Velcro
Strapped, lookin' like Michael Jackson walkin'
Don't be mad at me because you let yourself go
My gat too big to let my belt show
(But you got a gold belt on?) Hell no
But these chicks think I'm rich, they be screamin' Rittz when I'm on stage, like they at a Chippendales show
Got real dough, 18 karats on my deed, I see my future clear
Been all around the world here's a souvenir
I'm in Aruba with the coolest scuba gear (you mean scuba gear?)
Yeah homie, dive in, I be in the penthouse in Sydney
Chillin' on the balcony, grillin' out
No more Applebees, eatin' Wafflehouse, or Denny's (what you even havin' for dinner?)
No, I'm so 2017 (right)
Call me Young Johnny, call me Lil' Rittz
Even if I'm broke you could still feel rich
Hundred dollar bills, and the millions, brilliance
Gotta show Brazilians (Rittz keep it real, pimp)
Even when you feel pinned to the ground
Ceilings can be broke through, old school
Gold tooth, shinin' when I'm smiling you can get a little glimpse

I went from strugglin' every day to gettin' dough
People said I'd never make it, I should let it go
I was holdin' my composure knowin' I was next to blow
Everybody, every day, and we be fresh from head to toe
From mornin' to the nightfall
From the mornin' to the nightfall (aw, yeah)
Mornin' to the nightfall
I'm higher than a fly ball shinin' like a light bulb
From the mornin'
[Verse 2: Krizz Kaliko & (
Tech N9ne

Am I broke? No
Can I get the paper by the boatload?
Doing him a favor when I'm rockin' out later
Alligator on my shoes and boots
And new suit mean new recruits, ya dig?
(
'Cause you a pimp?
) Well I think I is
I get drunk and I think I is
I like to drink my whiskey in a tall glass with a short straw
They pay me but they short ya'll 
(
Okay
)
I boat costa from Costa Rica
Better get the holes open, it's supposed to freak ya
They ain't 'sposed to see ya, they 'sposed to be ya
A chariot on my penis (
Whatchu mean by that?
)
Rojo, when I chose to be a, never lovin' no hoes, never goin' there
But I'ma shoto, can get everything, I rock a Manolo
But it's a no no, don't take that picture like a photo
(
I see you bro
)
Then get the pot and go Doe Doe quick
I get O's from the Pogo stick (
They think they all so slick
)
They call Rittz while we both go pimpin'
Our names on the oval blimpin'
And it's so simple, they bow to us both like temples
Our names are all in they dentals (
All ya'll ballin' now, huh?
)
But we don't pay no rent and all I know is I went

I went from strugglin' every day to gettin' dough
People said I'd never make it, I should let it go
I was holdin' my composure  knowin' I was next to blow
Everybody, every day, and we be fresh from head to toe
From mornin' to the nightfall
From the mornin' to the nightfall (aw, yeah)
Mornin' to the nightfall
I'm higher than a fly ball shinin' like a light bulb
From the mornin' to the nightfall

See me workin', I've been waitin' on the high call
Been away from home for so Goddamn long but nobody ever tell me that my hyped called (that's poppin')
This is the path I've been bustin' my ass to keep on and get loose (word)
Waitin' for moments like this since way back when I was just a youth
Back then it was carnival, with a couple bars you could top it all
Spit shine on the track call me Armor All
And walk off with a life size Barbie doll, I'm like damn
My degree in high school came a couple clicks late
But I never took a break and I never changed pace
Lookin' back I never thought I would be livin' this great
(You mean you rich?) Well not exactly
I mean I'm in a band, I don't mean like Backstreet
I mean we juice it like a bunch a Russian athletes
All full of acne at a fuckin' track meet (Ha, I feel you)
You be thinkin' that I made it over night, you may wanna check in on the right call (Word)
None of it is oversight, if you don't believe me you just wait until the nightfall

I went from strugglin' every day to gettin' dough
People said I'd never make it, I should let it go
I was holdin' my composure  knowin' I was next to blow
Everybody, every day, and we be fresh from head to toe

Asian Fusion,Put a Crown on It,2019.0,"Verse 1:
I got cheese but I still rock Levis
In my throwback red and whites Deion's
Tour bus livin, I don’t even know who she was
All I seen was her teeth and her neons
Said it’s time for you to go, bitch be gone
Got the dab rig, hit it with blowtorch
I’mma hit the lobby then do a couple shots of Hen
Probably get obliterated with some coke whores
Some like ice skates, others might snowboard
From the summer  smoke  tales  to the penthouse suites
No more sleeping on the cold floor
My commode’s touch screen, what the fuck's the remote for
And I ain’t into spas and massages
Unless I’m trying to start the menages
People at the bar so obnoxious
Lately I’ve been focused on my money  making larger deposits
We’ve been representing the CNT as a family
Planning expanding out from Atlanta to land across the Atlantic ocean
We taking over, conquer the planet
And fuck how many people told me that it’s not gonna happen
Back in 95’ I started up in my studio
I recorded all the rappers I was still in the group with Joe
And the crew would go stupid over the years every dude was dope
Ain’t no future we losing ho, bunch of wannabe rappers
None of us graduated or got a diploma
The disappearance of my father made it hard to control
When the homies robbin' everybody, what you sold it gets stolen
So when they showed up to the studio we rolled it and smoked it
NAWF God hit me up, he said that “Put a crown on it.” should be the slogan
I agreed, that’s why I named my album that
Cuz we like royalty for sure and I’ve been on a power trip
Flavor like a Asian fusion dish, sweet and sour bitch, yee
Verse 2:
Shit I got Gucci on my feet, never wore a pair of Vans though
Nah, not me, came in here solo, but I’m leavin with a  rando
At the V.I.P table, bitch I’m Mr. Red Rope
Buckets full of ?, ? and Red Bull, yea
Mix it like an engineer and drink it like it’s jet fuel
Snorting lines of coke with the attendant in the restroom
Cutting lines out up inside the stall
When I can’t think of shit to say I let the diamonds talk
Shining hard on my chest like I just got struck by a lightning rod
I’m looking wet, no counter cloth could dry me off
I’m blinded when I look at the reflection up inside my car
Everyone pullin up on my side in awe
73’ Dodge Charger with the vinyl top
People wanna  come and start a conversation any given time a day
And rappers want to show me what they made
They thinking maybe that I like em sign em to the record label
They be looking at me crazy when I say the game is fake
Bitches keep requesting me to message me on Instagram
They say they got a question and a same incentive  as in the beginning
But the minute when I hit them back
They send a pic of titties and a video instead of saying “hey”
Any fan of mine I really do appreciate
It’s hard to stop and have a conversation with em when I’m late
But then again I hate a know it all with stupid shit to say
They give advice, but I’m the one that’s in the music biz, you ain’t
Wads they keep a knockin’ like I’m Magic Mike
Upset I might have signed a check or two, but didn’t satisfy me yet
I’m steady focused on the future,  had to strategize ahead
Flavor like a Asian Fusion dish, fuck a side of bread , yea-uh Yahh",https://genius.com/Rittz-asian-fusion-lyrics
Picture Perfect,Picture Perfect,2020.0,"You the guy from the BET Cypher right?
I saw you one day on Sway with gunplay (That's me)
You still signed with Tech?
Well, tell Wolf ""What's up"" for me
I miss Rittz back in the Slum days
My ex-girlfriend said you hung at someplace
Maybe the Sun Suites? You remember that?
Said you was cool 'til you got real drunk and just changed
And put someone's face through the wood in the bookcase
Or TV stand, whatever it was, damn
I heard you like to soak in the tub and snort coke (Nope)
I heard you cussed out a crowd for starting a moshpit
Where was that? At the NorVa in Norfolk? I forgot
I told all my homies that you'rе dope
I like when you rap fast morе than going slower
I got a joint rolled, I was told you don't smoke, well, I do
But with you I would tell you ""I sure don't""
I don't wanna get high with somebody so naive
They believing every word that they heard this day
Making up dirt like I'm not a normal person
Like I'ma let them talk to me a certain way
The moshpit shit's cool when in certain pace
To a beat like this, fuck yeah, but I do deserve, you disturb
People sick of words, getting nervous
'Cause a shirtless jerk screaming like he's Kurt Cobain
I hate a person that would purposely prefer to be a loudmouth
Try'na be a tough dude, end up getting round-housed
What you think I'm talking Kung Fu? Gun's true
Bow, bow, letting off rounds like a tap down
Blood-stained brain, blood stream's full of gasoline
Amoco and I’m so freaky even if I see a titty, bring the camera
Told her I wanna eat her out immediately
Even if she didn't shower, I'm an animal
Then again, if I get a hint of salmon roll then my little man'll go soft
Ever been tipsy when you fucked a musty pussy?
And your dick was smelling fishy, tell the bitch to go wash?
Summer's Eve body wash, stick it up inside the pussy
Honestly I was shocked, she ain't even kinda ugly
Judge a book by the front cover
The inside is nothing like a thot
Try'na spot demons when they hiding from me
Friends of mine benefited with hidden agendas
I had a hint but I didn't dig in as much as I could
Family members can be as Venomous as Indian cobras
They got a motive and they comin' for blood
Suckin' my pockets dry
Not surprised
I ain't even offering
Watch as I oxidize
Like an avocado green
Watch the guy on my side
Sam the bull Grabano me
You can paint the prettiest painting you wanna see but—

Nothing's picture perfect

You scratch the surface

Yeah uh yeah !

Don't know what day it is
Every day is the same on tour
Drank up all the liquor that we had last night
But the homies said they gonna bring more
Not sure what state I'm in
But I woke up in Missouri
Godemis brought a lot of chicks with him, so did Ubi
Holla to the homie Abnorm
This shit get dangerous
Don't say you ain't been warned
What's your vice? Let me know, got the works
Got the bars and the perks, got the white if its norm
My lord, two naked chicks, got the back lounge looking like a porn
Foot rubber's got her head in the merch guys lap
Head banging like she listening to Korn
Hit the hotel
Bought out all the rooms smoking out the whole floor
Fans in the lobby standing by the brochures
Knocking on the door empty-handed uninvited
So I'm geeked up letting all the people know it
Better wake up, we ain't going to sleep home boy
Afterparty checking out six in the morn'
You ain't really 'bout this life, said we done too much
To us its the norm

All night I'm

All night I'm turnin' heads
A bitch might break her neck
Chasing the paper so much and I'm finally able to catch my breath
I guess you could say I'm blessed
Party favors stay on deck
Fans give me free weed as a gift but I'd rather have some yay instead
I live life on the edge
Don't step I try my best
Patent leather 4's on my feet looking like the wind dance every time I step
Follow me, don't be misled
This bitch just got undressed
Tryna act cool, have sex with the crew thinking that they might get her a picture with Tech
Lemme text, now it was cool to see you twerk now I wanna see you spread
Do a trick with it, make it smoke a cigarette
I ain't even fucking with these hoes
I be cutting out the blow, oh shit, now there isn't any left
I get drunk and I be cooking shit like I'm a chef
You don't wanna sit down there's a wet -
Spot from a thot that somebody must've brought on the bus
What the fuck? It was red?

Luchini falling from the sky
Coolie High like I'm Camp Lo
My music beating so loud
No wonder why my last amp broke
Them Rockford Fosgates knocking my drop
Might rock that lamp post
Got powder all in my beard
I ain't been eating no french toast
I finally got a little bread
Went from a Kimbo Slice to a French loaf
Success done went to my head
I just spend more on my dress code
The Clintel is my team
I play point and I'm the head coach
It's Rittz, bitch!

My future lookin' so bright
I ain't sweating my past now
I've been working all night

I wanted to throw in the towel
I came so far that I can't quit
I have to say it feels great to finally see a hundred K on my bank slip
These hoes, they wanna strip down
But I got prior engagements
My lady's laying on the bed my leg in her ear, my hand on her anklet
She loved me when I was a bum
But I got a deal, I'm still letting it sink in
It's Monday morning, I'm home and I feel liberated like Big and Dre did
It's cool to rep for your town
Still, at the end of the day you gotta think rich
Still cruising on Crews road, gold flexin' my candy paint drip
Like yeah
People walk up on me in the liquor store they wanna take a pic
I can hear them arguing up in the aisle right beside me
Saying, ""Is it really him?"" and I promise you it is
I got time to shoot the shit
Even if they gonna talk on me to death
Told me he got Jonny Valiant and it never left the deck
Til he got Next to Nothing, so yo when's that new shit coming

And they got to see you winnin'
Tabernacle cathedral

Ain’t shit changed, but the time on the wrist watch
And my shit might rhyme, to design this  hoodie, they send another gift box
Not the type of rapper you gon’ find inside a thrift shop
Running to the money like a pitboss (whoa!)
Taking trips cross-country, My inbox full of titty pics, make a pit stop
You can see the lip prints on my dick from your lip gloss
Pimp shit, bitches always looking shocked, tell ‘em get lost
My celebrity affectin’ me, somebody must have tipped off people where I live
See them riding by my crib with they phone, poppin’ flix off, getting flicked off
I’ma upgrade soon, 'cause I just made 200,000 every time I check my balance
I’m astounding, counting down my racks, I’m 'bout to lift off
NASA, plasma TV 65 inch, class of 98’, skated out in 96’
Glass of Crown Royal, splash of a lime
Whizz, Massive amounts of gas, used to have to buy mids
Used to have to fry fish, thinking how can I fit all this shit inside this
Dumpster without having to dive in, making $9 an hour
I barely had enough to buy cigs
And I ain’t trying to say that I’m rich, but I ain’t trippin' on no ‘Port package
Livin’ more lavish, New York status
Got the horseradish and the Au Jus  on the side of my prime rib
I’m just proud of what I did
When people see you living better, they  lots of Dry Gin
But I ain’t finna let 'em nestle under my skin
Game over, I win in the end 'cause

So much time was spent
Trippin' 'cause I never had a dime to spend
Situation made it hard to find my strength
To convince myself in the end one day
I'd finally win
I knew I'd finally win
And I'ma keep winnin' again, and again, and again
'Cause so much time was spent
Broke in the same boat with my friends
But when I blew there were
More then a few that would try to act cool
But I knew they hate to see me win
They hate to see you win
But I'ma keep winnin' again, and again, and again, and

Feelin' Tom Brady in the Super Bowl
Ridin' in the ' Vette they gon' stay patrol
Rizz on that brown, don't lose control
All the work gone bring another load
Don't leave the state, out on parole
Safe full of money, kill me for the code
This a celebration , Laco make a toast
Everybody eatin', fuck who ate the most
Going coast to coast, shop at different states
Jet skis on the lake, feds try to build a case
Stab me in back, smile in your face
Laid back, windows tinted
Home run, ninth innin'
'member days with some pennies
They don't wanna see me winnin'

So much time was spent
Trippin' 'cause I never had a dime to spend
Situation made it hard to find my strength
To convince myself in the end one day
I'd finally win
I knew I'd finally win
And I'ma keep waitin' again, and again, and again

But when I blew there were
More then a few that would try to act cool
But I knew they hate to see me win
They hate to see you win
But I'ma keep waitin' again, and again, and again, and

I've done it all, seen it all
Slick boy , bitch, I was born to ball
Been kickin' up dust and stirrin' up fuss
Since a young nigga was about two feet tall
Been takin' trips back and fourth out the mall
Fuckin' up checks and servin' hard ball
Smoked the best green and shot at dope fiends
And hung with niggas who got lawyers on call
But now we gotta deal with the new wave
Some fake like Shaq wearin' Toupees
All the Instagram cap get you melee'd
Twelve addin' up shit like fifth grade
Some of the friends we grew up with
Ain't to be fucked with and crab any chance they get
Say that we'd kill for you but steal from you
Too old for that duck shit, quit
Actin' like you solid when you know you ain't
Ho runnin' through your vein like a blood bank
I mean the shit just pitiful, the hatin' gettin' critical
It rub off on a player like wet paint
Tell your partner that you comin' when you know you can't
Tell your homie you gonna help them when you know you ain't
Claimin' that it's all good but the shit fake
I can tell if you're a lame from a handshake
Ground floor, I'm getting money be the mandate
At the spot shit movin' like an earthquake
Fuck around get flipped, bitch, pancake
Do a 8, treat the shit like a mixtape
Say I'm strange but my clientele Norman Bates
Open 24/7 with the best rates
Watch the company you keep
Streets give or take
Ain't a perm on my name and I'm still straight

So much time was spent
Trippin' 'cause I never had a dime to spend
Situation made it hard to find my strength
To convince myself in the end one day
I'd finally win
I knew I'd finally win
And I'ma keep winnin' again, and again, and again

Shootin Star,Last Call,2017.0,"A-town bound drinkin' straight Crown
Everyday we celebrating like we seen the peace drop
Drink a bottle of liquor then we restock
Got the free blow for the hoes and the geek squad
Be my guest, you can say that I'm blessed
I don't get a lot of rest but I get to do my dream job
D-dot shades on, my Levi's, J's, black T-shirt with a CNT sign
CTS-V series, the interior's soft
Showing off spread my feathers like a peacock
I'ma keep grinding til the day I finally got a diamond
On my finger bigger than a ring pop
Finally hit the sweet spot, you can hear the beat knock
Rumble in the sheet rock, why you try'na eavesdrop
In the hotel with the Molly Ringwald
In the field like I took a pill in Ibiza, ya-ya-uh-yeah
Life is a like a see-saw, feeling like I'm stuck in the air
Everyday I'm discovering something I wasn't aware
I been winning for the last five years
I ain't like them when I rap, I'm rare
Like a flash in the night in the sky
They swear they saw a

Shootin' star
I've been known to go stupid hard
Shootin' star
Fly and showing my jewelry off
Shootin' star
Speakers boom when I'm zoomin' off
Shootin' star
My kind is kind of unusual
I've been known to go stupid hard
Fly and showing my jewelry off
Speakers boom when I'm zoomin' off
People see me and swear they saw a
Shootin' star

My kind is kind of unusual

Smokin' on a Cuban Cigar
Feelin' like King Crook with my homeboy Doug
Kickin' it with Detroit Don up in Heart Rose in the neighborhood where the cop won't come
If you wanna get an Uber
Fuck her till the crowd showed up
I can hear 'em cheering Rittz and my heart got pumped
Time for me to give it to 'em raw and uncut
Bout to see a shooting star close up
Play the hi-hat
Everybody in the crowd relate to me and they be singing A to Z
'Cause they can see that we are not afraid to keep our head up
When they said that we was bade to be the underpaid and
Can't achieve our fantasy, that's damaging our confidence
Never had a scholarship or went to college but the ones who did
I bet they kinda wishin' they done had a major that had got 'em in a dominant position
But instead they went and got a job but OfficeMax, damn
Don't be mad, it's a job and it's finally Friday, it's five pm
Hit the bank, you could save it or spend what you made, hit the ATM
Life might not quite go the way we planned
We about to sleep in, we been up all night getting high
We been looking in the sky like man, I seen a

Toxic,Put a Crown on It,2019.0,"I wish I didn't feel like the biggest piece of shit
Choking on raw emotions I'm holding deep inside of me
Feeling so lonely, over my shoulder there she is
So far apart but I could feel her breathing right behind me
'Cause we ain't even fucking, starting to accept it
We just say I love you, ain't no hugging, ain't no pecking
The minute that we said it, how much longer can we sit here
Watching Modern Family, popping Xannies drinking all the whiskey
Till we're screaming and we're arguing, mainly 'cause we're wasted
Neighbors call the cops again, I don't really blame them
But they don't know about us, both of us are crazy
We get into bed and laughing 'bout the stupid shit that they said

People hate that we're together, saying that we're toxic
Like all we do is argue with each other and get upset
So I told her baby if, someone say if we get
Separated from each other, then it may be best
They don't fully understand the way our brains connect
Until the day we're dead, I'll be in love with a toxic relationship
Oh, I'm in love with a toxic relationship
I'm in love with a toxic relationship
I'm in love with a toxic relationship

I'm so upset with you, I get pissed and call you names
You mistake it for hatred and say I mentally abuse you
I just don't feel I could kill you if you tried to leave
Or at least give me some head, instead you do it when you choose to
We ain't even fucking, there ain't no discussion
We just go get drunk and ruin another family function
Your mama looks disgusted and probably wants to jump in
'Cause the police came and cuffed us up for causing a disruption, drop one
We go to dinner with family and friends, we still ordering shots for the table to drink
They know it's only a matter of minutes before we start fighting, that train's never late
Usually arguments start with a joke that's involving the character traits that we hate
Guzzling bottles of Crown like it's water, it's hard for our marriage to carry the weight
You leaving? Wait, I'll help you pack
You hit me in the face, people held me back
You kicked me out? Oh bitch, I'll bounce
Don't be calling me asking me where the hell I'm at
Well guess who's back on your broken bed
With my shirt torn up and my cellphone cracked
People don't know why we don't just break up
Roll my eyes when they tell me that it's toxic

People hate that we're together, saying that we're toxic
Like all we do is argue with each other and get upset
So I told her baby if, someone say if we get
Separated from each other, then it may be best
They don't fully understand the way our brains connect
Until the day we're dead, I'll be in love with a toxic relationship
Oh, I'm in love with a toxic relationship

Paranoid and High,Put a Crown on It,2019.0,"Verse 1:
Daylight turns into moonlight
Back into daylight, still I’m wide awake
Try to take it slow when I toot up
I did too much by mistake
Out the corner of my eye hallucinating
I keep seeing spider, snakes
That are crawling on the floor
See the coins and ashes
Dead bugs, massive carpet stains
Background noise from the TV , I hear Scarface
I’m sure Office Space is on right now
My attention span is gone
Time for me to take a coffee break
I thought that the weed make make it better
But instead the mix of the two increased my high
Paranoid, peeking out the blinds in the window
I’m recalling thinking the police outside
I love my dog, but the way he’s looking at me
Had me thinking that he might attack me
That’s geeked up, I ain’t never sleep for four days
I’m just having a bad week
Wrote so many songs that my hands got cramps
And my hearts still clenching with tremors
Staring at the infomercials
Feeling like my head's in a Ninja blender
I’m too high
Hook:
There must be a full moon in the sky
You can see my pupils are huge in size
Sometimes I hallucinate and try
Try to keep my cool, but I’m way too high
I’m paranoid and high, paranoid and high
I’m paranoid and high, paranoid and high
Paranoid and high, I- I- I’m paranoid and high
Paranoid and high,paranoid and high
I’m paranoid and high, paranoid and high
Paranoid and high, feeling like I’m gonna die
Verse 2:
Got some mushroom caps from my dude
In Nashville Tennessee, he done gave us a bunch
Everyone settle down, let’s do this
We all had a few that we gave them to bust
Pretty soon all the music was sounding so smooth
Like a wave  in the ocean crashing ?
Bubbles in the shoreline
Told my girl I’m gonna bring home drugs that you’re gonna love
On the drink it was Thanksgiving, we ate four caps each
Hoping the shrooms kicked in soon
We were living  with her mom at the time and it sucked
Us and the dog stuck in the bedroom
All the sudden out of nowhere they kicked in real hard
I was just hoping I had the feeling from the tour bus
But I’m short of breath and I feel like my shirt collar’s choking my neck
Michael Jackson’s Bad 25th anniversary
Was on TV when I started to puke more
Started witnessing trippy things
Shivering under the blanket, jacket and shoes on
Felt the poison run from the top of my head
Down my spine to the tip of my toes
Took a whole eight hours to get it out my system
I should have never brought the road home
Paranoid and high
Hook:
There must be a full moon in the sky
You can see my pupils are huge in size
Sometimes I hallucinate and try
Try to keep my cool, but I’m way too high
I’m paranoid and high, paranoid and high
I’m paranoid and high, paranoid and high
Paranoid and high, I- I- I’m paranoid and high
Paranoid and high,paranoid and high
I’m paranoid and high, paranoid and high
Paranoid and high, feeling like I’m gonna die

Just Say No,Top of the Line,2016.0,"Dear Lord
Please forgive me
I'm so ashamed of everything that I've done
I'm trying to be a better person, God
I need your help

Who the fuck gon' pick me up when I fall?
Waiting on my Xanax to dissolve
Eat a bar just to go on stage
Just a bottle was a problem that I just can’t solve
On the “Slumerican Made Tour” last Fall
Everything snowballed, lookin' back and I’m appalled
Hit an all time low, had a two month binge
On that Blow, and I know you heard that song
But this real life
Ever wake up from a drunk night like you pissed people off?
That was me the whole tour
When I got home, I was so embarrassed
Had me feelin' like I need to call - Wolf
And say “Sorry” for bein' so obnoxious
And constantly actin' like a junky, a Jay
On his bus doin' bumps, in my bunk
In the dark, from my heart, and the A

God bless my soul
Demons following me everywhere I go
That temptation in my face I can't control
Trying to chase them down this straight and narrow road
Here I go
Just say no!

But I can’t, goin' up to fans
About to damn near beg for drugs
Tellin' them I can get 'em into backstage
If they get me some, my self-respect was gone
I stayed up all night with Ounce and Big Henry
Then go and get a room about 2 P.M
Eating Xanax in the afternoon
Cause I’m panicking from the Coke
My heart, don’t know what mood it’s in
I FaceTime with my girl in my room
And when I finally fall asleep I make her watch
It’s a daily routine, I tell her I can’t breathe
And to keep an eye on me, just in case I stop
Look at my face in shock
My nose was so inflamed and swollen
So much abuse to it that it got infected
It’s five times it’s normal size
Plus, I blew my knee out
Drunk, tryin' to slap box a wrestler
Up at Whistler center
, about to hit the E.R
It’s hard to explain yourself
Why your nose is the size of Gonzo's
The doc knows you’re a cocaine addict
You can only blame yourself
Here I am in the hospital bed
But instead of regret, I’m thinking about the cocaine I left
On the bus, I officially flushed
I told my girl I'm okay, I’ll be home in two days to rest
I got home, but really all the damage was done
Couldn’t go out into public without being nervous
And my dick didn’t work for like a month
Couldn’t bend my knee up in physical therapy
But as far as Coke and the urge, I was done
Didn’t learn shit, cause I did the same thing on the next tour run

God bless my soul
Demons following me everywhere I go
That temptation in my face I can't control
Trying to chase them down this straight and narrow road
Here I go
Just say no!

No!
No!
NO!
Yeah..
Fuck it, give me some
I'll do a little bit
Yeah..

Injury,White Jesus Revival,2012,"Do you remember when ('member when)
We had our first argument arguing (arguing)
I was on the love seat you was on the ottoman
And we were talking shit
I called you a whore you're jaw dropped when I called you it
You punched me in the mouth with a closed fist
I choked you right and front of your mom and them
Do you remember that 'member that
We was at my nephew's Christening and you were mentioning mentioning
Some dude that you screwed and instantly I got pissed and we
Started causing a seen cussing loud in the parking lot at the church
You scratched me then I slapped you then we went home and fucked right afterwards
I think that were

Meant to be meant to be
We got a special chemistry
With a lotta drunken memories
But I'll always love you endlessly
But sometimes love results in injury

We get drunk to fight (drunk to fight)
That's like what we do for fun
The condo we moved in was brand new till we argued throwing shit
You would punch a bunch of holes in the wall holes in the wall
You remember when you broke the door so many carpet stain I throw coke in your
Face you spit on me hoping to provoke me more
I ripped your necklace off then the dog would run
Then your mom would come trying to instigate
That night that you hit with me the dinner plate
I pissed and I hit you with the Wendy's bag
I took the burger out and I mushed you with it
You were hungry to I slung all the fries in the hall
Then you hit me in the balls and cried
Other couples hang with us and be like God you guys are just

Meant to be meant to be
We got a special chemistry chemistry
Whole lotta drunken memories memories
But I'll always love you endlessly endlessly
But sometimes love results in injury

So many vacations got ruined we fucked up Disney Land
We got into a huge fight that sucked we showed out right in front of
Your brother and his wife but Fuck that whats they get for inviting us
We don't know no better we get hype and drunk
Me at the Hawks game I was trashed blacking out
Going up to groups of dudes and I said You some diesel motherfuckers that I need to slap around
They coulda fuck me up thank God they didn't
We shoulda went to jail fighting by the conference center
I threw your brand new cell out the window you threw mine too
Then you ripped off my car antennae
Kelly and Charlie's that wedding was the worst of all
I think the whole hotel could hear
Us screaming and fighting cussing and fussing and fucking
Everyone could tell that we're

Meant to be meant to be
We got a special chemistry chemistry
With lotta drunken memories memories

Victory Lap,Last Call,2017.0,"Yeah
I went from forging my report card
Skipping courses with my boys
Smoking 'Ports up in the courtyard
Poor choices wasn’t going far
Rapping, hoping doors would open
I was sure to be a born star
I kept my sword sharp
Rhyming when I finally got a deal at thirty-two
I put the pedal to the floorboard
Proving I could score points for the label, playing forward
Steady waiting for the day to play the point guard
Either way I’m still onboard, still on tour
Sixty days and still long gone
Hard to explain the feeling placing on the Billboard charts
Whores rush the tour bus but you’re busted
You’re nothing but a dildo toy
Objectified, undress when you step aside
And sexy and set beside the leather, fluorescent lights
Set the vibe, never said goodbye, only next in line
This is life, catch a flight: this is my exit sign

When the hard times come wave ‘em goodbye
In the end I won, time to take my victory lap
Stand up for me, whistle, and clap
It’s Last Call, homie, Rittz will be back
On the track put ‘em up
Put your peace signs up, have a good time
It’s been one good run, 'bout to take my victory lap
I’m thanking ya’ll for putting me on the map
It’s Last Call, homie, I’ma be back
I promise that
Ya-Uh-Yeah

They say I only rap fast but it’s my comfort zone
Before, the younger me stumbled on Thuggish Ruggish Bone
I’m like a bumble bee buzzing, functioning drunk and stoned
Did a bump a blow and smoked a blunt
And went and chugged Patron
Running like I recovered the fumble thrown
Running wrong way down the field, like fuck a go , internal compass broke
No direction coming from a place, you could tell it’s safe
Like you left the base and slid into the open home
Like the kid that’s eatin' lunch alone, I don’t belong
Raps redundant shit no wonder why they humming country songs
Switching up, giving up. Punctured holes sunk they boat
Throwing in the towel cause when they dug they never struck for gold
Fuck it , search your soul, you could grunt and moan
Like I used to do with you, you could just adjust your tone
Get the cream, fuck the cone
Fuck it, grow up, it goes up, but no one controls what you want

When the hard times come wave ‘em goodbye
In the end I won, time to take my victory lap
Stand up for me, whistle, and clap
It’s Last Call, homie, Rittz will be back
On the track put ‘em up
Put your peace signs up, have a good time
It’s been one good run, 'bout to take my victory lap
I’m thanking ya’ll for putting me on the map
It’s Last Call, homie, I’ma be back
I promise that
Ya-Uh-Yeah

I done been around this country more than I can count
Unfortunate my mind is cloudy. Why can’t I remember shit?
I done sold some albums, nothing to write home about
I hope that when I’m gone I’ll be remembered for my penmanship
I done noticed most of the rappers that I’ve met
Are egotistical but fool you like they got a humble temperament
From the outside looking in you think the game is what it ain’t
It ain’t the music it’s the money and percentages
Some business shit that you can't comprehend so don’t pretend you can
Shooting vids in alley ways, my Timberlands got bitches' shit
Up in the tread so bad  that they got trashed, they  was a Christmas gift
Shit like this reminds me of the time we wasn’t privileged
Penny-pinching wasn’t spending it, so frivolous
So this is for the fans in the beginning, they were listeners
And let me and music have a chance and I’m appreciative
My mission ain’t accomplished but you brought it where it is so

When the hard times come wave ‘em goodbye
In the end I won, time to take my victory lap
Stand up for me, whistle, and clap
It’s Last Call, homie, Rittz will be back
On the track put ‘em up
Put your peace signs up, have a good time

But it’s a few days away from April Fools
How the fuck we supposed to raise a kid
We both wake up everyday confused
Like did we fight last night
Where the blood come from on the door
I was sleepin’ on the floor
You was accusin’ me of cheatin’ on you
Reaching for the heater in the drawer
I was dreaming and I saw you
Crawling on the bathroom floor
Trying to cut off the vacuum cord
While you locked yourself in
But that’s a nightmare
In real life we’re eating lobster, caviar and shellfish
The night starts around 12ish
Me and Slick Man, Hitman, Shawty at the 12 Den
Bounced south from the east side
Young homies running red lights
Speeding in the Hell Cats
My whole crew know what it feel like to be broke
We supposed to be the have nots
Now we have knots in our pocket
No cap, bitch text me I wrote back using Cap Locks

When the curtain opens up I can smell the fire
All I see is the smoke and the eyes of my fans
Light the pipe when they recite my words and when it flies at first
I feel the goosebumps rise on my skin
'Cause the music gave us something in common we all feel
Now we get together up under the same roof
Let them bring upon the TNT

Bartender said they got no Crown because it got sold out
That's what the fuck goes down at my show
And somebody threw an 8-ball on the stage
Put it in my pocket, if I just flew
I'ma straight chug another bottle
When I vibrate out I take Tums, I won't stop it 'cause
'Cause the vibe right now is great
I don't want no problem
Busting bright lights off my chain
Watchin my medallion
When the crowd shouts out my name
I'ma take a bow when they cry out loud , my king
I just feel empowered
Put you lighters and your phone up in the sky, wave 'em 'round as

We illuminate the night
We illuminate the night
We illuminate the night
We illuminate the night
It's CNT and we illuminate the night
We illuminate the night
We illuminate the night
We illuminate the night
It's illumination
Taking over
Through the nation
Made it global
It's illumination
Made 'em notice
Jubilation
Can't control it

People told me that they made a mistake and judged a book by its cover
When they discovered my music but that don't make any sense
If you got a glimpse of me and you can see I'm a player illuminating
Then you basically as lame as it get
Probably wouldn't relate to me if you made an attempt
Customizing all my sneakers and I lace 'em with gems
Blinded by my diamond ring, I think it's making them squint
Take an average day and make it an event, lady and gents
It's the white boy that they call Rittz
Throw the middle finger up like, what's good?
CNT and we don't fuck with y'all bitch
Lace the Crown with the Xanax bars we crushed up
I don't get a lot of promised economy, rappers, see 'em and I laugh
Commenting constantly tryna see if I react
All my followers calling me, I'ma lead 'em down a path
We got problems in common, so I'ma speak on their behalf
'Cause they said I'd never win, I was called a loser
By my ex girlfriend, I bet she feel kinda stupid
But I just go cash my check, I been moving units
All my fake ass friends I had, throwing up the deuces
The mistakes I made have past, looking at the future
So I pray and raise my glass, straight up when I shoot it
But I owe it all to you because the music is a movement
And we glowing like the ring around the moon this is

It's illumination
Taking over
Through the nation
Made it global
It's illumination
Made 'em notice
Jubilation
Can't control it
I'm seekin' to illuminate the night
We illuminate the night
We illuminate the night
We illuminate the night
Strange Music
We illuminate the night
We illuminate the night
We illuminate the night
We illuminate the night",https://genius.com/Rittz-illumination-lyrics
Lonely,Next To Nothing,2014.0,"(Hook)
Been out on the road so long I
Feel like I'm locked out my own life
It could be worse it ain't like I'm dying
Lonely is my company
Can't wait to get home and relax
But I'm out here grinding believe that
It could be worse but the fact remains that
Lonely is my company
(Verse 1)
This touring shit ain't what you think it is
Coming up in this music biz ain't  glamorous
We just left Atlanta drove from Boston to Los Angeles
Somewhere in between I lost my mind like I began to just
Party like I'm trying to die call an ambulance
I almost overdosed again
My time is mostly spent
Alone inside my room at some shitty motor inn
There's  roaches in the shower
But the show is in an hour
When it's over we inside the van on the road again
Last night I got so drunk that I was comatose I went
And punched a bunch of holes up in the wall and broke my hand
Puking blood from too much liquor tripping snorting coke with fans
One of my closest friends called my phone and asked me how's it been
Told him man I been…
(Hook)
(Verse 2)
On tour with Tech I had to catch a plane to Hollywood
Mansion in the hills
Shooting Switch Lanes I done made it
Can't believe it's real
Right in the middle of us filming got a text from my girl
Pictures of her bloody face
She slit her wrist and fell
Pills in her system
Doctors said she tried to kill herself
Put her in a padded room
Sent her to a mental health
Facility they're telling me that they won't let her out
1000 miles away there's only so much I can do to help
Now my album's coming out in like a week or so
My videos on MTV
The love of my life is stuck in Georgia Regional
They let her use the phone
She called me and she's crying
Saying ""Get me out!"" ""I'm trying""
At the meet and greet I'm lying
Like I'm fine, I've been dying
(Hook)
(Verse 3)
I was out on tour with Snow and Jarren Benton
It's so embarrassin when
You're drunk and acting dumb
A ton of strangers there to witness
Late nights with DJ crisis getting drunk and talking business
In the winter overheating
Turning on the air condition
Mostly I was lonely
Talking no one there to listen 
Crying in the mirror staring at my own reflection
Drugs and alcohol got me all emotional
Overall I'm in no condition to battle my own addiction
Before you know it though the tour is over so it's history
Missing Thanksgiving day but hey you made it home for Christmas
You see the one you love and try to pick up where you left it
I love her and I missed her
But she says I'm acting distant
Told her listen I've been

Stars Align,Top of the Line,2016.0,"North Side
A-Town
Ye-uh-yeah, uh

Can't find a lane? Then you should make one
We the future like an alien intruder with a ray-gun
Fly as fuck or scared of heights or aviation
You lookin' for someone as tight as me, there ain't none
Uneducated but I ain't dumb, paint shinin' on my Cutlass
She's my pride and joy like Stevie Ray Vaughan
Got a lot of dollars off my occupation
Jealous, poppin off, it's obvious they pocket change shrunk
Now they wanna come apologize and make up
Got ho inside em', they should go apply at Avon
And those the type of guys I try to stay away from, they be too lame, but they say they keep it A1
I bet I lay one
Out across the pave-ment
If they say somethin', I don't play no types of games son
I'm representin' where I came from
North Side of the A, bitch until the day my grave's dug
Standin' straight, weight on my shoulder weigh tons
Representin' Clintel-Strange-Slum it's Rittz bitch!

My time has finally come to take what's mine
I see my past life behind me, I just wave goodbye
I'm reachin' for the stars, I'm reachin' for the stars
I finally see the stars align
I'm reachin' for the stars, I'm reachin' for the stars
I finally see the stars align
It's about that time

Look, I heard your entire tape and wasn't inspired
It was hard for me to make it through but since I'm a - rapper
I feel like I should listen, now I'm wishin' that I didn't
I would rather watch an episode of Empire 10 times
And I don't even like the show, chopping rocks of white
Just know I tried to crush it up but then my license broke
Your style's old like yellow stripes on  and wire spokes
It's time to go, I know your goal ain't to retire broke
But on a brighter note, they might be hiring at Kohl's
Try Verizon Wireless, there's always people buying phones
Drunk or flying drones, crowds at shows are multiplying
Fire marshal tryna say we violating codes
Spraying my cologne, smelling like a millionaire
Silver pair of Jeremy Scott's I hardly ever wear
Black hoodie but the fabric's made of leather
Looking fresh like I was Fred Astaire, with a better head of hair
With no fedora on, fuck is going on?
Rappers dressed like Def Leppard, so, ""Pour Some Sugar On Me"" in the name of love, I ain't never changing up
I be backstage with the - bitches in there taking bumps
Love to blow a dick so much she just might suck the pigment off the skin
And when you nut she rubs it in like it was facial scrub
Too busy getting money, I can't conversate with ya
And I don't rap for free, I want some compensation, bruh
Mike was cooking up the beat, he hung his apron up
And when he did I picked my pen and paper up
It's Rittz, bitch

My time has finally come to take what's mine
I see my past life behind me, I just wave goodbye
I'm reachin' for the stars, I'm reachin' for the stars
I finally see the stars align
I'm reachin' for the stars, I'm reachin' for the stars
I finally see the stars align
It's about that time

Listen, I'm not your homie bro, we barely know each other
You think we close because we did a couple shows together
Some folks I met on the road, I'll probably know forever
You just kissing ass, always asking, ""Can I open for you?""
I got a talent for spotting hidden agendas (Like what?)
You tryna copy me, watching like an apprentice (Hell nah)
I'm not Italian but I got some homies down to do a hit for me
They caught him and shot him in his appendix
It's funny all these dudes, they shoes and scarves
And thinking they look original but they copying Jimi Hendrix
But everybody's looking for something like Annie Lennox
I'm looking for someone to bring the Xanax
Higher than Bob Ross, watch me while I paint the canvas
And you just a ho, I figured you oughta know, shout out Alanis
Morrissette, portraits I painted, ain't it gorgeous?
Still I made a fortune, Porsches and Corvettes
Run up with the torch lit
Run off at the mouth and we gon' show up at your doorstep
Fuckboy, probably think he fly inside his Ford Flex, pocket full of Boar's Head
Cheddar but never seen competition, doomed to corpses
You must've been born deaf, really you can't be serious
You making Silkk the Shocker sound like he's the greatest lyricist
That ever lived, that's not a diss, I'm just comparing them
I might not be the biggest fish in this aquarium
But everybody in the water scared to fuck with me
So fuck I'm chalking up the piece, slumping in my bucket seats
Like, Riiittzz Biitchh

My time has finally come to take what's mine
I see my past life behind me, I just wave goodbye
I'm reachin' for the stars, I'm reachin' for the stars

Feet Up,Put a Crown on It,2019.0,"This shit should be against the law for me to be this raw
I wonder who's keeping score
My pinky ring lookin' like it needs dethawed
Drinking Jim Beam PBR
I think she caught
Eye contact recognized I rap, now she's in awe
My pressure might take your breath away, she need CPR
CNT from the G.C, we dem boys
Some rap some keep that soft
Got the weed, got the speed, we got that boy
Jays talking with the geeked up jaw
Got a glee 44 off in the glove box cocked if somebody on my team get robbed
We gon' leave this apartment looking like a horror flick, party like a scene from SAW
Mise en place , everything in place
Funny how much money that my ink pen made
From New Zealand to England they scream my name
I ain't stoppin' 'til I'm kingpin paid
Pussy pig skin pink and she keep her thing thing shaved
But her face really not that attractive
Tried to snort up all the blow, I'ma tell her go
'Cause she got a nose like a shop vac attachment
Fuck a ho with my gold chain on, sock-hat and glasses
Soap opera actor, no far from it
Let the bitch ride, I don’t need carpoolin
She did kind of swallow and start gargling
Why you gotta throw salt, y’all talk too much
Can’t dodge bullets, no Keanu Reeves
You make believe like Apollo Creed
Somebody put the crown on me

Get my shit for free when I see my weed plug
Couple bitches in the bathroom doing key bumps
They going in and all around the world and I receive love

You know you can’t, bitch
Verse 2:
Should have known I fuck a story on the mic like Conan
I stretch you out like a Trojan man
Who the fuck said you my broham
Somebody call the animal control on him
Like a Doberman bit his owner’s hand
On the road with the dopest fans
I can tell you wanna grow like a coca plant
I done fucked that bitch, but we don’t hold hands
Your new girlfriend is an old romance
You can have that bitch I can’t
Remember that much about the times we fucked
But I know that she don’t suck dick that great
Man I wish you luck, got the pistol tucked
In a midnight Chevy Colorado
Long hair hangin’ out the beanie
People see me and  they say I’m like a fatter Polamalu
Get your head cracked like a half an avocado
Split wide, homies can not have you in their household
Zip tie, talking shit I’ll run into your mouse hole
Bitch, I rest in peace, speaker ???
Homie hit me up in heaven now
And they proud sayin’ Rittz still spazzin
Made another independent biz transaction
Sitting in the crib with a bitch
Bout to hit this dab rig

Some people real good at getting cake
Other people real good at being snakes
I’m trying to accumulate all that I can make
I don’t take breaks, gotta hit the brakes
I don’t associate with fakes
Why you caught up in the hate, I’ma shake
Gotta push up like weights
I got red paint with gold flakes
Gotta watch out for these flakes
Got big tape, that’s red tape
I want the head, not the headache
I go and get it, fuck fate
I’m true to the game, I won’t forsake
All day and all dates, the grind comes first
I’m trying to get me three commas
And avoid that hearse
Be dead or dead broke I don’t know what’s worse
So kill the converse , I’m back on the search

Pie,White Jesus,2011,"Ooh, they been hating on me lately and I know why
Cause I’m so, I’m so fly
And they so pie
These rappers say they hate me, then I know why
Cause I’m so, I’m so fire
And they so pie
Homie, the only thing you’re killing’s my high

(I'm on) Anthrax Xanax and red bull, I’m fly I’m fresh from head to
Foot, looking like someone you want to be next to
People hear my music and they’re sayin' the next dude
Well excuse me, let me get through please
They don’t want to see my next move
Tounge-flippin when I’m spitting like I drank a tank of jet fuel
Flow go stupid like a student in a special ed group
Let’s move, Rittz to the rescue
Fresh new Ecru shirt, let me get my cape on
Drinking on some aged rum with a blonde bitch in my bed
I'm the rap game’s James Bond
Everybody want to hate on me (why?)
I just want to drink and have fun, bitch Wang Chung
Maybe cause your girl been eyein' me since day one
Now she with the crew, but she bout to get her train run on her
Put the snake tongue on her
Thats when I guess she want to see how good the lizard is
She lick my dick like it’s a stick of licorice
And when I busted it she said it was delicious, Rittz
That's when I, dismissed the bitch
And man it’s funny when I was young I predicted this
Everybody that was down would eventually switch, and start jumping ship
Now they see me with Slumerican and wanna get their membership
But I'm high, I’m so high like I’m working on a scissor lift
And I don’t give a shit bout who my critics is
Ears burning every time they try to mention Rittz
I guess I b-b-been infamous, at killing rappers and you wishing you was sick as this
And it’s senseless, hating is a sickness bitch
This whole lane complaining cause I’m the shit, I guess

Ooh, they been hating on me lately and I know why
Cause I’m so, I’m so fly
And they so pie
These rappers say they hate me, then I know why
Cause I’m so, I’m so fire
And they so pie
Homie, the only thing you’re killing’s my high

What’s up man, this big ball
Doctor sticky, I’m on call
Left the club with my dogs, I keep the pistol in my drawers
Will I change, you never know
I say no, Imma be me
Imma be ball, Imma be G
You can’t break me down to my knees
And I’m so pimping and I’ve been told
When I write it comes from my soul
When I rap it gets in your soul
It help me like I was some dro
Rapping loyalty and loyalty percentages are low
These niggas touch a couple of dollars and start acting like some hoes
What I think, let them be
Who they want to be cause it don’t hurt me
See this belly didn’t get fed on what the next motherfucker had to eat
See I’m hustling while you sleep
And I’m gon shine like my teeth
And I got 45 reasons why you bitches don’t want no beef
Let them hoes pump you up, reality is what I’m speaking
I got purple in my cup, in the pulpit preaching
Heaven or hell, freedom or jail
Them niggas be hating and I know why
Cause big ball so fly, and you niggas cherry pie
Pussy

Homie, the only thing you’re killing’s my high

You pie you man you tired as fuck
I can spot a duck from a mile away
Homie you can’t hide it bruh
You acting like you got a vagina tucked
Between your legs, jealousy a female trait
You a guy or what?
If someone told me homie buy the four
You mad at me? You should be happy and applauding bro
What, you tried to rhyme and you kinda suck?
What, you mad cause you run around with strug and signed with wolf huh
You standing in the line and they already let us up inside the club
You can’t afford a bag of mid and we be smoking on exotic buds
You got some old retro J’s on, and my Prada, so god is gruff
Is that a motherfucker’s problem cuz?
Well I’ll tell you what the problem is
You a lame ass pussy motherfucker, you a follower
It’s getting hard for me to walk when everybody hanging on my dick
Well Imma keep on pushing, thinking Imma fall off
Hater better keep on wishing
You bought a crib on the internet, that’s it
Meanwhile I’m making history in a treesound session
One time for crew chain, buzz, and molly too
Slumerican dammit, and we came to win
I’m at the range with the ATL twin 
Let the player hate then begin
Because

Don't you ever try to call me back
You understand me?
I'm gonna say this right now for the record
I'm 100 percent on my mom's life
On my sister's life, on your life
I never ever ever caught a fucking girl
Never
Some bitch gave me a fucking number
With some meth attached to it
I took it and threw it to the table
I don't know who the fuck called that bitch
But it's sure as fuck wasn't me
I told you never ever ever ever ever try to touch my fucking clothes
And realize that I'm the only only fucking reason you have any structure in your life
Do you fucking understand me?
I will fucking bury you
I will fucking kill you
I will fucking push you under the fucking ground
Do you fucking understand me?
You little motherfucker
I'm out here tryin to make a living for the both of us
You fucking ungrateful, you fucking asshole
I'm out here tryin to make a living for us
And all you give a fuck about is some bitches
And facebook, stay the fuck off of facebook

Gravy,The Life and Times of Jonny Valiant,2013,"They said the best things in life are free
If that’s true then my life would be
Great, but it ain’t cause I’m broke as fuck
And I can barely afford to get a bite to eat
I bum a cig' and say that I’m so tired of balling
Really I’m just getting sick and tired of calling
My girlfriend up, like I need some gas money
You got a twenty or something that I can borrow
Lying to her like I’m gonna pay her back tomorrow
Cause she broke bartending tryna work for tips
Puttin' up with old men at a white trash bar
Saying let me get another drink sugar tits
But how can I provide shit? I’m a starving artist
Praying one day my big break will come
Sometime life’ll have you so distraught that you forgot
Everything you should be grateful of
Like waking up inside a home when you could be homeless
Talking on the cell when you could be phoneless, shit
I got some weed, I got some drink
I got my family to love me and a couple homies
That’ll hold me down, I woke up this morning with a different outlook
I hit the drink then ride down 85 south

Everything is G R A V Y
In the front seat of my cutlass sitting sideways
Everything is G R A V Y
So drunk that I’m glad I made it to my driveway
Everything is G R A V Y

No money to buy weed, I’m rolling pennies
In a dish pit, speaking broken spanish
Getting off work late, everything close
Totino pizza rolls, eating frozen dinners
It’s like the bad luck streak just won’t diminish
Cause the rent is due, and the bills are late
You can feel the weight on your shoulder getting heavy
And you ready to say fuck it, I can feel your pain
You pray to god please give me strength to overcome this
Feeling lost up in the way without a compass
You start regretting shit that you ain’t get accomplished
Pompous, people want to judge you and it’s constant
I hit the liquor store and get me some more Thompson
Might be cheap but it gets me drunk
And I start to feel the pressure, feel like giving up
It’s like the alcohol buzz done just enough
To give me a reminder of the fact I’m blessed
You ain’t a loser time to get up off your ass and win
Got homies in the pen doing life
They ain’t never gonna get to see the grass again
I can’t imagine them, they probably envy me
So with that in mind, I hit the drink and ride
And put some Outkast on

Everything is G R A V Y
In the front seat of my cutlass sitting sideways
Everything is G R A V Y
So drunk that I’m glad I made it to my driveway
Everything is G R A V Y

My Famous tee matchin' 
Used to hear hate now it’s just applauses
Making lump sum deposits, man the stars aligned for me
It’s finally us that’s flossing
As we dump the ganja guts, flying it’s obvious
Bitches ain’t nothing to them as they watching us
They lusting for me, now my pockets done got robust
We done had the fussiest bitches on the bus
We drink a crown, royal smoking an ounce of kush
Kick em off and disappear in a cloud of dust
Pray the lifestyle now I'll adjust
My dad just hit me up and said I probably was
It feels good, in God we trust
I bow my head, and pray so I don’t ever try to take it for granted
I was just doing open mic night
Hyped, 
screaming 7-7
, 0 and making em chant it
I finally signed with a record label and damn it feels great
This is 15 years in the making
Burn one on the beat, put the pen to the sheet
Got to let the world hear what I’m thinking
As I'm sinkin in the seat of an old school cutlass
I take another drink of the cup and ride

Born For This,Top of the Line,2016.0,"Yeah
When the rest of the world go to sleep, I
I be getting drunk, probably on some kind of drug
Tripping looking at the street light
Tryna write a rap, on a laid back beat
But its hard, I'm on a speed high
The C-N-T my crew, we cool
But we grew up in the street life
In other words, we gon' sting 'em when they swinging at the bee hive
Rewind, ain't nobody reach out
Back when I was coming up, now they hit me and get mad if I don't reply
Where were you when I was cleaning out the deep fryer?
Didn't wanna swing by
Hoes saying he's fine, yeah right
Saying that I wanna fuck, she lying, she trying
I can tell by her face that her pussy smell like a sea lion
Only D she gonna get is denied
Couple grand inside my Levi's
T9 put me on, and he always wear red
But I swear if somebody disrespect him, I'ma check him
He don't gotta give a green light
Listening to Big Mike, rap music used to be tight
Some of it still is, but a lot of it is street hype
Back when I was praying I would make it
This ain't what I thought it'd be like, despite -
All the fake shit, I'm really happy to achieve my -
Childhood dreams and a ton of shit's sweet
Every now and then its sour like a key lime
And when it is I gotta remind me
That I made it to the big time
And I know I might not be as big as T.I
But guaranteed, if you see me getting behind
A microphone, I'ma bring the heat each time

Cause I was born for this
I'm so lucky to be this fortunate
My life, my heart, my soul got poured in this
And I'ma keep going until my story ends
Until the Lord above me decides to turn my lights out
But for right now
I ain't trying to put this mic down
Stage is mine now

Told my parents I was gonna make it one day
They ain't never look convinced
I was just a little kid at a young age
They probably thought it was a dumb phase
And I quit school, said I'm stupid, told me just wait
I regret it and I do, I was thinking I was cool
Started fucking with the drug trade
Just knowing I might end up blowing up big
I was finally of age, hitting up Atlanta at the club late
Doing every open mic, looking like a straight target
I was unsafe, in the middle of the hood
Only white boy on stage, had to let my nuts hang
Fifteen years later, all the work paid off
Kids coming tryna run game
Only difference is, I was a lyricist
Before the internet opened up the floodgates
When white boys had to have skills
If you didn't, then you getting booed, getting jumped
What you just say?
Had to live what you rapped back then
Nowadays you can say you 'bout gunplay
When you shot a target at a gun range
You can say you got a plug, I ain't following for the pump fake
Saying Usher's your cousin, your uncle is Just Blaze
As far as bullshit go, nothing much's changed
I'm getting better every year
All I see is competition to me that I wanna try to upstage
And there's still a lot of people that ain't never listened to me in their life
I think it's time to get an update
Rappers that I gave my demo tape to in the past
Tryna come and get my number, we should touch base
They could be me one day, but I'm hotter than a sun ray
I'm blazed

Cause I was born for this
I'm so lucky to be this fortunate
My life, my heart, my soul got poured in this
And I'ma keep going until my story ends
Until the Lord above me decides to turn my lights out

The C-N-T and me, I brought the rest of the South with us
The smell of my outfit it's so loud on the cloud thickest
So I don't got not time to pay attention to gossipers
Slumerican the clique if they ain't with us they not winners
Monstrous platinum murdering you are an eye witness
Run for cover thought I was bluffing, now die bitches
Your five fingers only thing the Troopers done found
The rest of your body dumped in the Chattahoochee to drown
You fucked around and shit so don't be trying to punk me it's gon' be a bloody-

MURDAH!
You step to Rittz up in this bitch; it's about to be a bloody-
MURDAH!
On any record, any second, it could be a bloody-
MURDAH!
Give me a reason: leave them leaking, got them screaming bloody-
MURDAH!
Jonny Valiant in this bitch!

Whack rappers be thinking they doper then they are
I should have a deal, I supposed to been a star
I rather watch an episode of Khloé & Lamar
Than have to listen to you spit a bar this shit is garbage
Get a thesaurus or a rhyming diction-
-ary every verse I heard you laying is terrible
That bullshit'll never get no play on my stereo
You don't want to challenge me cause if anything I'll embarrass you, bitch
Red do and I'm daring you I don't care if you buzzing online it doesn't make a difference to me, nah
Many trending MC's, before I let 'em beat me I will put a pistol to my head pull the trigger and squeeze
Before I buy a pair of skinnier jeans
A nightmare, I don't fight fair, can you put an end to your dreams
Keep sleeping on me and pretending I'm weak
I'm takin' over, guarantee that when you see me there gonna be a bloody-

107.9 in Atlanta told em better play my record cause if not I'm bout to murder your staff
Guess I'm headed to the peoples station
Great strippers waiting, with his gun he told me put down the gat
I looked down and laughed and smashed I'm like fuck it I'm gone
My manager calling me pissed, ""what the fuck have you done?""
I told him: ""I been representing for Atlanta since the 90's showing love, so why the fuck nobody showing me none?""
I'm sick of holding my tongue, while so many come and go
And nobody try to put me in the spotlight yet
A ton of rappers like me been grinding for years trying to make a rep for this north-side shit
So before I quit I'm going to go on a killing spree
And murder anybody trying to say they ain't feeling me
Or any whack artist trying to say they as ill as me rappers biting wanna Milli Vanilli me bout to really be a-

Ya runnin but ya can’t hide
Strugglin tryna stay alive
People plottin on ya gravesite
So watch out for the snake eyes
They so cold blooded (2x)
Yeah..
(Verse 1)
I done met all types of people
Good and evil
Been amongst all walks of life
Some that you be perceive to be decent
Will soon deceive you
Cus who they really are inside
Ain’t who you thought they were
At the bar we worked at was full of skeletons in the closet door
I knew a couple named Steve and Rose who’ve been known to slow base
Let me start the story off with her
She was an alcoholic, but so was he
Socially they were both popular
So in love, it was rare to see him and her not there
Words can’t explain how shocked I was
And then when Steve walked in with his blood shot eyes
Cryin, I could tell that he’d been up all night
Told us that Rose had overdosed commited suicide
And the woman that he loved just died.  Not Rose!
People sittin at the bar froze
Made a toast to him, may she rest in peace
With his head in his chest, Steve wept with grief
He got drunk, went to get some sleep
It’s sick cus after he left rumors started to fly
Someone said Lady he’s sketchy Steve, been seen numerous times
With another girl he screwed on the side
Now all of sudden she was dead it seemed little odd (odd)
Was it crocodile tears he was cryin? Was it all a façade?
She could drink, was it really a bottle of pills and some vodka that caused her demise?
A lot of the guys started callin him a murderer
And I ain’t really tryin to accuse him but
He was kissin on his new girlfriend at the bar same night of my funeral
Cus she’s so cold blooded
(Hook)
Ya runnin but ya can’t hide
Strugglin tryna stay alive
People plottin on ya gravesite
So watch out for the snake eyes
They so cold blooded (2x)
(Bridge)
The ones that you trust are the ones in disguise
Thought you was loved but then gonna find out your despised
Snakes that were hiding they strike
They so cold blooded..
(Verse 2)
I knew a couple named Ike and Linda
Same bar, different story
Let me think where should I begin?
I wish this was a fiction piece
But I witnessed this shit time and time again
Ya see, Ike was the quiet type who shot darts with his best friend Mark
But he liked a pinch
Of cocaine and raw but none of us woulda thought his life would come
To a violent end
Until one day the bar got silent then
You could hear pin drop the minute that Lyn walked in
Cryin, cus she said Ike died someone tied him up and then they set him on fire, damn!
They found his body right inside of the complex
Whoever did it must’ve had an accomplice
But the cops just said it was drug deal gone bad
Tried to blame it on the drug problems
What I found bizarre was
They found an empty gas can in the storage compartment
That had Lyn’s palm prints
But it was her and Ike’s place so
It wasn’t enough to implicate her involvement
Case unsolved and two weeks later it would raise an eyebrow
But they burying him
Everybody at the bar found out that Ike’s friend Mark got married to Lyn
Cold blooded bitch!

Ya runnin but ya can’t hide

Look

I'mma head turner
People wanna sweat me I just let 'em stare
Disrespect me and I'll check 'em like a questionnaire
Yeah, Gwinnett's in here, so bring the sireens
Cause we in the club rollin' up some sticky lime green
High beam spot
Light is mine for the time bein'
On a murder, rappers turn a track into a crime scene
I taken from investigators they gon' find we
Ridin' dirty, no I'm not referring to my hygiene
No sir, brushin' my shoulder there's no dirt, no
I'm so fly that I should be stylin' in a fur coat
Oh, my pinky is twinkling, I let it radiate
Two step n' snappin' in the pattern leather bathin' apes
Some 808's, boomin' like a cannon ball
I ain't knockin' where you from but this is how we do it in Atlanta dawg
Purple herb and xanny bars, rollin' on them hard drugs
Splurgin' in a fancy car, survin' on the hush hush
In the club buzzed like a yellow jacket
And we can get those cigarillos crackin'
I tried to tell 'em

I-I-I'm a head turner
A b-bread burner

770 is where I'm reppin' you better let 'em know
Where they be lettin' them o's go for the extra low
I'mma let what I gross grow till I get it sold
'til my necklace is rose gold with those precious stones
Let it show, I used to flex and my bread was low bro
Stretchin' dough, I ain't talkin' pretzels and crescent rolls
But now there's several O's in front of the decimals
So every ho that knows it approaches me sexual
But no I don't get attached
Where them gold diggers at
Probably at the club sittin' on a go-getter's lap
I'm at bar doing Jägerbombs and Redheaded Sluts
Or in the Chevy with the red leather guts gettin' some cut
And I'mma beat it and butcher it
Teasin' her with the green that she couldn't get
Because baby Jesus sweeter than sugar it's
The only way I can put it is that we gettin' it
Count it up
Chevy Impala's my clique as slick as we mount it up
Ain't nobody else in the county fuckin' around with us
Nobody put it down like the homey Jonny Valiant does
It truly is beautiful executing this hustle
Try to turn around too fast and end up pullin' a muscle cause

Now I can't even go anywhere without people staring me up and down
Like I'm walkin' on red carpet, I guess they love my style
I'm stickin' out like a sore thumb when I'm on the Crown
Walkin' up in this, discover me droppin' a couple thou'
I be in SoCal buyin' the whole aisle
Walkin' by and these hoes smile looking like ""Oh wow""
Like I think he's a rapper, he walks around like he's famous
They call me Rittz bitch
In case you forgot what my name is
Competition invisible
A ton of other crackers call themselves Rittz but this is the authentic original
Man the kid is invincible
And I don't mean to be so egotistical
But being broke for me seems so pitiful
We be moving o's some sugar lows
To people room and road
And if not we in the city doing shows
All the pretty hoes sayin' ""God dang did you see him?""
Man my chain swing like Tarzan from a tree limb
It's pimpin' season
Consistent chiefin'
Nothin' commercial
Puffin' purple I purchased from the Pacific region
We drinkin' free Hen
When we up in the club we automatic begin
All the hoes attracted to the cash that we spend
I could fuck around on a rap 'til the end
So fuck a sixteen bars
I'm tryin' to start a ménage with twelve or fifteen brauds
And I'mma hit that pussy hard 'til the bitch see's stars
That's how it is when you living large

Good Life,Last Call,2017.0,"From the outside looking in
Pictures on the internet, you be thinking all I do is chill and live large
Gotta save what you made when you tour 'cause it’s August and I ain’t made a dollar since March
Shit’ll make you go create a Kickstart page, dark days homie, I was really hit hard
Last year, spent 25 grand trying to help my best friend beat a serious charge
Me and my fiancé been engaged, but to help him with his case, I was dipping in the paper that I saved
For the wedding and the family ain’t chip in shit, so I’m paying for the caterer, the cake, everything
And the dates coming soon, money doing down payments and all of the arrangements are made
Even though we’re going broke so excited to get married, everything felt great for a change
Plus I had some tour dates up in Canada and the wedding’s one month away
That’ll help to support us, Out of nowhere my world got rocked
With some girl I was getting blackmailed and extorted
Wouldn’t pay her, so my lady had to deal with her as torment
Right before the wedding and it ruined it
Honeymoon room with a gorgeous view, can’t enjoy it
We was thinking we was gonna start to live a

Good life
Who doesn’t want to live a good life?
One day I’m gonna live a good life
Shit ain’t as easy as it looks like
Why the fuck is it so hard to live a good life?

One day I’m gonna live a good life
Shit ain’t as easy as it looks like
Why the fuck is it so hard to live a good life?

It's a cruel world when you don’t have a day job
Need to take a vacation, instead we got a room at the Aloft for a few days
Chef Chad hooked us up at the Rafain Steakhouse, feeling great now
My lady said it was okay if I went to bed, she stayed up
Got drunk by herself, had one too many, tried to walk, fell and hit her head
Good thing I went to check on her 'cause she was unconscious and drenched in blood
I looked and I could see the white meat
People staring while the paramedics pushed her through the lobby
Now they’re in the hospital hooking her to IVs
Sitting there drunk inside a M.R.E, while they stapling her head
Then she got a CAT scan, came back and they said they found a hemorrhage
On her brain, and explained how bad her condition is
We were having dinner, this gotta be a dream, she just fell
Now you’re telling me her death may come in a matter of some months
We were crying, saying that we love each other and we wish we would have just stayed home
The nurse came back and she said good news, my fault, must have read the x-ray wrong
That your brain’s okay, you should both slow down
If you don’t then you won’t live long have a

Who doesn’t want to live a good life?

Why the fuck is it so hard to live a good life?

Gotta separate your homies from your business partners and it’s hard to
Several times, severed ties with my friends who had done a contract and I’m caught up in a lawsuit
My lawyer said I’m gonna take a lose in the courtroom, Gotta settle it and pay 'em like you got loot
Conflict of interest, comes with the business, articles are endless
Tryna figure out who double crossed who, Followed by the devil in a costume
Thought you knew I loved food, cooking is my plan B
Now the doctor tells me what I can and can’t eat, said I’d have a heart attack
Telling me I can’t drink, can’t think without a pill, panicking I can’t breath
Pop a xanex on the couch, me and my wife both no job, no drive, both dying
Both drinking, watching time fly by, but we both die slow
Thought the money would have changed us
We was broke,  , but we both know we lucky to be alive
Always wanted to be famous, wonder when we’re gonna wake up, appreciate the luxuries of life
And it doesn’t take a genius to see that drugs and alcohol took its toll, done it one too many times
Getting drunk and took a dive, like fuck if I survive
I don’t want to die, I just want to try to live a

Same Old Me,Top of the Line,2016.0,"People all in my business
Talk about me online
Homies saying I'm changing
Calling me on my downtime
I can't pick up my phone because I just got home
And I've been gone two months my time is spent
I got a fiance take a while to adjust being home then I'm gone again
How the fuck you know how much money's in
My bank account, its funny the assumption made
Crumbs don't become a cake overnight
On the road for over fifty-something days
And I still can't post a GoFundMe page
Without a dumbass telling me, ""You got it, Rittz""
So many hands in my pocket
I feel like the cops are frisking me looking for my dollar bills
I took 'em so low on the OD tour, lost like fifty-five grand
Lesson learned, I can't afford to bust shit
I told my girl we gotta cancel our plans
And I went off on a tangent
A rant, cause I'm panicking
Life as a rambling man, it's apparent that
I'm damned and I can see they can't get a handle of saying it
But do it for my handful of fans
And I still ain't changed
(Simultaneous with hook:)
Never
It's Rittz, bitch

People change and I don't know why
Cause I'm still the same old me
Aw yeah
Money come and go, but so what?
I'm still the same old me
Aw yeah, aw yeah

Look, might've seen me on a poster or the grocery store
People that are scared to approach me are
No different than me
I write raps for a living and I'm overjoyed
And even if I get no awards for my music
Fans say it helped them cope before
Made 'em hope for more
Sometimes the sky can seem so out of reach
When you're sitting on the ocean floor
I did Breakfast with Sway
On Shade 45 with Heather B
You can see the YouTube video
Where the mic fell, shit was embarrassing
Did a song with Trae the Truth
I met Devin the Dude
And man, I just did a video with Twista
Shit I - think somebody needa pinch my - arm
Here, lets take a picture for the Insta - gram
This is Famous fam with no Travis Barker
Tagging ""Rittz Bitch"" with a magic marker
The Agora Theater in Cleveland to Phoenix
It's like I'm on a magic carpet
Shit I'm dreaming a bit
Sold out shows, I was up in the arena with Tech
Then I flew back home to Atlanta, did a show for my homie
Only 25 people was there, but I rocked that bitch

Cause I still ain't changed
It's Rittz, bitch

People change and I don't know why
Cause I'm still the same old me
Aw yeah
Money come and go, but so what?
I'm still the same old me
Aw yeah, aw yeah

One time for the dreamers
I pray your day will soon come
It's hard to know what you here for
It'll reveal itself in due time
I rap with friends who ain't made it
Let your lyrics channel through mine
Two times for the fans that motivated me the minute I started to lose sight
They be showing up in each, state
Fans overseas saying peace, mate
They loving the lyrics because they re-late
They give me the motivation to cre-ate
When I'm faded it gets hard for me to see, straight
To my family I used to be a di-sgrace
The time I'm spending rapping was a big, waste
But I finally got a record deal a big, break
Time to be, great
Homie we, chase
The paper til the muscles in our feet, ache
And finally I got to have a sweet, taste
Of victory, picture me rolling with the homies C-N-T, mane
Everybody in the world wanna de-bate
Who's better Meek, Drake?
I'm just hoping that I reach, they
Level, went back-to-back-to-back
Haters saying he, changed

Like really?
Ain't shit changed
I still live in Gwinnett
Still got the same homies
Clintel
I ain't rich, bitch
I'm Rittz, bitch

You could give her anything she wants
Wine and dine her on a date, two one hundred dollar plates
Steakhouse, give filet mignons
And she might take her clothes off her body but my name stays on
And I know you hate to see it, you tryin' not to look
Imagine I was shocked, never thought she'd fall in love
I fucked her once, and afterwards she told me all she wants
Is a tattoo of my name and she went and got it done
Thought that one bitch was crazy, fuckin' her just made it worse
There's several others that I fucked with did the same as her
Starin' at it in the mirror on her bathroom break at work
She said my signature reminds her how I made her squirt
Better, badder, she's a soaker, told me that I broke her record
Squirtin' like a water gun, we Super Soaker sexin'
Her man wanted to cover it, she told him no and kept it in
Any chick this skeptical to get the dick, I told them ""Let me, bitch""

Keep 'em all happy, that's how you stay the fuck out a bind
Tattin' my name all on your body, that's outta line
I gave no permission, girl, that's like you done did a crime
But I appreciate the effort
You ain't gotta really gas me up like a Tesla (nah)
Just because I beat the pussy up like a wrestler
White girl - how it feel to call a nigga ""Master"" (hahaha)

Shakin' all over the bed, I got you out here feignin'
Takin' my phone, reading my messages is schemin'

If you hit it from the back, and look at her ass
You gon' know for a fact I was there in the past

She fucked me, and the rest of them dudes
It's her choice, she don't wanna be your angel
She's hella wild, gotta grab her by the ankles
Whatcha gon' do with a bitch you can't handle?
Playin' love songs and burnin' candles (she want what?)
She's gonna cum, she a nut freak
You see that dollar sign on her butt cheek (you see it)

Summertime riding on Sugarloaf
Group of people trying to flag me down and beep their horn
Yelling out the window at me saying ""Rittz Bitch!""
""We proud of you Homie, keep it going!""
And my reaction?
I was smiling ear to ear
Off in Sugarloaf Mills shoppin off in Manhattan
Fans asking me shit while I'm picking out clothes
Used to wish that I'd be famous for this rappin then it happened
Homie said I'm snapping I dapped him up
Took a pic for Instagram in Sunglasses Hut
I told him ""Post it up and tag me bruh
I follow back, spread the word""
I don't ask for much and that's some real shit
One of my friends said ""Does that get hard to deal with?""
Fuck no man I'm hoping that I still get
Love five years down the road from now or when it's over
I'm about to soak it up until then
People staring at me in the restaurant
On the days I want ‘em to nobody notice me
But when I'm in my comfy clothes and leave the house
Someone's gonna know it's me and come approach
I see a kid walking to my table
My girlfriend said fuck she ain't trying to be ungrateful
She just hates that she can't leave the house without makeup
People post shit on Facebook and end up saying something hateful
Homie wasn't trying to take a pic of us
He said I can't believe it's you I keep up with your stuff
You music got me through a stint in rehab and a bad breakup I relate so much
You're blowing up now
He said it's got to feel great that your paid and you made it

And then he asked me is my album out yet
What? I said yeah motherfucker
Jonny Valiant drop last year, fuck you been?
And then I realized
Just because people recognize you don't mean they bump your shit
But some people think I done struck it rich
Because my shit is in the stores
And I did a lot of tours
And they seen me in the cypher on the BET awards
I figured I'd get 100,000 Twitter followers, that was that
I didn't, I'm not complaining this is all fact
Taking flights to LA and New York
Doing radio interviews
Opening huge doors
Money spent is towards your budget
You ate good for a minute
It's finished and now you got to pay it all back

And recall back
When I called that number for le Cordon Bleu

Mothafucka must've lost they mind

Not a day goes by when someone ain't talkin' shit
They either brutally honest or the opposite
He said ""He doesn't really feel my style, but you can rap good luck!""
That's a backward ass compliment
I can't respond to them I really want to snap
""Is it just me or does Rittz suck, he's wack""
It's like no wonder why my postures bad
Too many hatin' swinging on the only pair of nuts I have
So why the fuck you mad?
""I sent a track way back I was hopin' you could tell me what you think of it""
Man I think I get this once a week
Sendin' me a song for me to hear without a link to click
Irritated sayin, ""How much for a feature Rittz?
You said it was a G on Basket Case""
It was a Grand back in 2011 and went for 3-5 now, I'm sorry you might have to save
It's funny people tellin' me what type of track to make
""You should do a song with him, put him on the end""
Namin' big name rappers that don't fit in my budget but they don't understand the biz they imagine it
On the real though If I could do a track with Drake or Kanye I would do the shit cuz I'm a fan
Made a joke and I post like I did and now my so called fans said they was unfollowin'
Like what's the problem dam?
""What you tryna go mainstream on us Rittz?
You supposed to keep it Strange""
My opinion is if you support a label that was underground then you should wanna seem em be the biggest name
Playin on the radio like every single day
Now where the real fans that be thinkin' out the box?
I show love for Jump St
These other punks need taught a lesson
When I see em I'ma cuss em out

Is that that bitch?
That been talkin' shit online?
Is that that bitch?
That's been commenting all night?
Is that that bitch?
Mothafucka must've lost they mind
Thinkin' that you know me cuz of the internet but never met me in real life?
Cuz you don't know me bitch
You don't know me bitch
Hell nah you don't know me bitch

You don't know me bitch
Hell nah you don't know me bitch
Is that that bitch?
You don't know me bitch
Hell nah you don't know me bitch
Is that that bitch?
Mothafucka must've lost they mind

Look I'm realistic
I know a lot of people don't think logistically before they go and type some shit
The internet makes everyone accessible
You can go and tell 'em what you didn't like or did
And you can get it off your mind, and vent
And feel like you lookin' someone eye to eye and spit
Like your opinion matters, at least it got you feeling like it did
But what's your name again? I forget
I'm looking at them like

Is that that bitch?
That been talkin' shit online?

Love Me,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Let me tell you a story
Yeah, well let me tell you about Kesha and DERON
Kesha was afraid OF getting cheated on, he was always gone
One day she was peeking through his phone
Saw a couple texts about sex DIDN'T KNOW WHO THEY WERE FROM
She just tried to play dumb
The following Friday, he said he's gonna kick it with his boys at the drive way
She hopped inside her Honda and followed him
I'D A, paranoid if I was him
But he ain't see her follow him, behind him when he PULLED into the parking lot
Met this white girl, Kesha's jaw just dropped
When he kissed her and he piNched her LITTLE ass right in front of her
Kesha started crying, she just couldn't stomach THE THOUGHT OF HER FIANCE underneath the sheets
FuckIN SOMEONE ELSE pulled a gun from underneath the seat OF THE CAR
SCREAMED ""DERON how you gonna do me like this?
You wanna leave me to SCREW this stupid white chick?""
She said, ""who are, you?""
""I'm his future wife bitch, Kesha BLACKED OUT HER PUPILS LOOKIN HUGE AND lifeless
She pulled the trigger, shot the bitch in the head
Shot DERON and she CRIED while he bled
All she said was...

He don't love me, love me
He don't love me anymore
Don't love me, love me
Not the way he did before

Well let me tell you about Cindy and Todd
Todd got Cindy pregnant so they moved in together to start
A happy family but everything is falling apart
They always arguing cause Todd is partying hard
He's got a credit card again so he could save his cash
Spend hers on the gas SPEND HIS ON A BAG OF SOME ICE plus he stay up all night on mother's day
HE HAD A STORY CINDY SURE HE'S HITTIN USHER LATE
She's crying, why you choose the drugs over me
Every night you either GEEKED up, drunk, or smokeIN' weed
How we the fuck we supposed to be decent parents when the baby comes
You ain't EVER HOME I'M ALREADY RAISIN' ONE
But
She know better, she's what you call a CUTTER
When she's depressed, she goes in to the bathroom CUPBOARD AND TAKES A BOX CUTTER SCRAPES HER ARMS TILL THEY BLEED
No wonder in the summer she was wearing long sleeves
ALL SHE REALLY WANTS IS A MAN OFF SPEED
""GOD PLEASE"" SHE WAS SCREAMIN CARVIN IN HER PALMS CREASE
Bloodstains on THE CARPET
Scars on her thighs, all she does is sit in her apartment and cry like ""why?...""

He don't love me, love me
He don't love me anymore
Don't love me, love me
Not the way he did before

The last story is about DevIn and JoANN
She's been his girlfriend for 7 years but he's a married man
Told Joann that he plans to tell his wife that it's over
He's got a couple kids, but he would DISOWN 'EM
And run away with her so they could start a life together
They plotted this for years, it's finally now or never
But DevIn starts to think about his daughter and his son
And starts to feel guilty bout the father he's become
Now the thought of leaving home's not an option
WANTS TO try to work on his marriage, first he got it break it off
With Joann, when THEY HAD THAT phone call
She just lost it, she said, ""your love is all I needED, it was god sent
It's all I ever wanted, I can't live without it
You wanna live without me, I just won't allow it""
The next night at 11:34 PM, she just went and broke in DevIn's door
Creeped up the stairCASE to his daughter's room
Neighbors said all YOU heard, was a loud boom
AND she shot his son TOO laying in the BUNK bed
Dude on the news said it was a blood shed
DEVIN'S RUNNIN DOWN THE HALL THEN YOU HEARD A GUN GO OFF THEN YOU HEARD SOMEBODY FALL
Heard she shot him in the balls and NECK
WEND AND KILLED his wife WHILE SHE BEGGED, shot herself in the head
THE SUICIDE LETTER SAID THAT...

He don't love me (DAMN, BITCHES ARE CRAZY), love me
He (HEY, LOVE'S A POWERFUL THING) don't love me anymore
Don't (LOVE IS A POWERFUL THING) love me, love me (I LOVE YOU)
Not the way he did before",https://genius.com/Rittz-love-me-lyrics
So Strange,White Jesus Revival,2012,"Superstardom
Who woulda thought that a losers what the used to call him
Family and friends didn’t give a shit when I was falling
Like limbs do in autumn, now they callin
Tellin me the musics awesome
Improving comments read messages
Say goodbe to your privacy
As soon as a friend request is in
People read your business online one time
And they might have only heard of you once
Then the hit you on facebook or twitter with a message
And they feel like they deserve a response
They hit my girlfriend up, now they doin to much
Man you fuckin with my personal space
All up on the personal page
When I’m on stage and the curtain is raised
I be feelin like a bird in a cage and its so…

So strange
So strange
So strange
So strange
What bitch all of a sudden I’m attractive?
As if, last year you would laugh if I asked you out
Well now since I got a name rappin
You gonna let the whole crew fuckin pass you ‘round
Ex-girlfriends comin out the wood-work
What a prefect time to come back around
Oh its cool that I’m rappin now
But back then, you were, actin
All high and mighty in your cap and gown
Does everybody hate love?
According to my girl if you ask her
If she likes goin out with a rapper
She’d say it’s a disaster
While she tries to figure out my facebook password
And I ain't even doin shit
She liked it better when I had a job watchin time waste away
Getting off, poppin pills sittin ‘round, getting fat
Havin dreams about Rachael Ray
I tried to walk away like Macy Gray
But stumbled in the jungle among those snakes and chimps
Record label executives actin like snake-skin pimps
I just give and they take my cents
Im so sick that it make them winch
Like I was breaking wind
Me and my girl on a break again
I should have tried suicide
But instead I went and did another fake attempt
I didn’t break the skin
Come in, take your grief
This shits so...

So strange
So strange
So strange
So strange
I done seen my partners become imposters, constant contracts
Sign em I become a hostage, read the fine print, snort become unconscious
Friends don’t even know it but they on my watchlist
Hold up let me kick it up a couple notches
Hit the ganja, bambaclot its some rhinoceros comin
Isn’t this fun to watch me squash this track
Murder anyone that ever come in contact, rap
Why you trippin on me? Cause I’m Black?
Wait, cause I’m White?
Maybe cause my buzz is like a bunch of yellow jackets buzzin by your ear
When I’m buzzin high I’m here, tryin to touch the sky
Well everybody piggy-backin
I think they actin funny, I told my homie he could get a free ride
To the phonies Ima throw the peace sign
Nobody ever told me shit was gonna be fine

And pissed off sayin' ""Dawg it's on"" said he was all alone
N' said go offa O' Noir cross the street and he started pumpin gas
Some punks we had beef with then a pass
Rolled up and they jumped his ass
His face busted bad i hung up and called the crew up
Said i knew were these dudes live and we gotta do somethin'
Motherfuckas tryna prove somethin tryna have a dude jumped
Four cars deep when we pulled up
They was outside ready to start ringin'
And swingin' brass knuckles and aluminum bats
It'll do any task, just wait a minute
Up in the hospital, we cut a life pour it in a bag

Same shit different day, Same shit different day
Same shit different day, Same shit different day
Same shit different day, on the Northside of the A
Same shit different day, Same shit different day
Same shit different day, Somebody got robbed
Somebody got sprayed, somebody got paid
Said wuddup homie wudduya say

Unborn Child,UnKnown,UnKnown,"To my unborn child
This is a letter that i wrote about the child that i never had
Confessions and regrets i kept inside my chest its time to let 'em hatch
I dont expect to feel like I'm forgiven
Your mother misses you and wishes you were sitting by her side and living
Really I'm to blame mainly it was my decision
I couldn't envision raising a baby and the time was ticking
I ain't justifying my position i was unemployed
Struggling with a life i once enjoyed
I treated you like you was a problem that i want destroyed
Far from being someones father i was just a boy
But enough exuses tired of covering up the bruises
Cherish life can't imagine what I've proven taking another human
You could've been a genius
A blessing sent to bring us everything instead i treated you like you were an inconvenience
And it seemed i felt relieved and glad I had the choice
But I can't help but wonder if you had your daddy's voice
Or got your mommas looks and pretty hair
Its a shame cause at the time i didn't care
Didn't share the same emotions i could grin and bare
Some people sit and pray for life i took for granted damn it isn't fair
I took the chance and interfered with nature's course
I hope the lord looks upon me kindly even though i never show remorse
Im so embarrassed too
Im 24 and immature if i wasn't living off my parents I could care for you
And find a house to buy
And I ain't got a shred of credit and my bank account amount is dry
Sometimes i think I'm just a lousy guy
No doubt in mind if I was more responsible you never would've been allowed to die
Ive said the hows and why's a thousand times
Feeling stupid rapping to you like i knew you that's just how I try
To let it out inside without a cry
Wondering if you lie in heaven when i look across the cloudy sky
I've gotta live with what i did and take the punishment upon my judgment
Im the one who wanted it
You never made any further than your mother's stomach kid
This songs the only way I've ever tried confronting it
I can't correct the past just know your mom regrets it bad
I just wanted to explain myself because i never have
And I know that i could never ask to get you back
Truly yours from the dad you never had

Dear Rebecca,UnKnown,2020.0,"(Play the guitar)
Verse 1:
Since you left, our home feels like an abandoned building
I just sleep in my truck at night because our bed's too cold
And all these beer cans turn to ash trays filled with Winston Reds
Your cell phone's off, wishin' you would have left a note
Because baby then I'd know what was so bad
I was drunk so I forget what I did
Should have never let me drink tequila, girl you know how I get
Dear Rebecca, when you comin' home?
I'll wait forever if forever ever comes
Was it cause I wrecked your car
When I left that titty bar
Or the bar tab that I charged
When I stole your Mama's credit card
I'm sorry, girl
(Baby, I know all the times I done you wrong and all I don't deserve you. Come on, girl.)
Verse 2:
I don't understand why you just can't call me
(Staring at my phone)
Another Friday night all alone at the Golden Corral
The same one we had our first date
The night you tried your first mid rare steak
We couldn't wait to get home, having sex in the handicapped parking
(You remember that?)
So why'd you up and leave me, girl, what's all this about?
Hell, I swear sometimes I wish you never bonded me out
Dear Rebecca, when you comin' home?
We've been together, been together for too long
So don't believe those rumors you've been listening to
Cause when I'm with your sister, Misty,I pretend like it's you
I got a bad feeling that I might know where you went
When I looked on your Facebook page I saw my best friend, Jim
Girl you better not slept with him
Oh no, little Becky Lynn
God damnit, girl
Cause no matter what the outcome is I'm whoopin his ass
Girl, I've cheated on you too and you keep taking me back
Dear Rebecca, baby when you comin' home?
Cause he could never ever give you what you want
And I hope you understand
If I get a second chance I'll show you there's no other man that'll love you like your second cousin can

Rattle Back,White Jesus,2011,"Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah-uh-yeah

My shit's snapping, my shit, my shit's snapping
Speakers and tweeters beating, my whip got that rattle back
My shit's snapping, my shit, my shit's snapping
My whip got that rattle back, my whip got that rattle back

You can find me out on Pleasant Hill inside a red DeVille
24's on it, got it lookin' dressed to kill
Tryna smoke another Philly while I grip the wheel
Weed spinning out the window like a weather reel
Still sipping on Bacardi with that ginger ale
Riding like a bitch, like a fish, when I ride the wheel
Kick off your heels and hop in, bitch, let's go pop some pills
I got the Xanax, white girl looking like Paris Hilton
Hair cut low like Keri Hilson
Said that I turn her on, and she jerked me off
I kept swerving, I could barely help it
12 was roofless and the Yelawolf was
On the CD player, somewhere to go
Speakers booming, and my beeper booming
Tryna go and get a bottle from the liquor store
Then I kissed the ho, and told her thanks for the handjob
Bitch, see you later, bye
Then it's back inside the Cadillac on 85
Coppers want to follow us and try to give us DUI's
They be thinking that we drinking and we way too high
Probably right, got an eight ball of white and some of Rocawear
Everybody stop and stare when they hear all the knock that I got in here
A shake on me, got a rocking chair
Roll down the window and a cloud appear
Looked like a goddamn volcano
Saying hi to the haters like they know
They can see the chain glow, what it is lame-o? They know

My shit's snapping, my shit, my shit's snapping
Speakers and tweeters beating, my whip got that rattle back
My shit's snapping, my shit, my shit's snapping
My whip got that rattle back, my whip got that rattle back

Speakers and tweeters beating, my whip got that rattle back
My shit's snapping, my shit, my shit's snapping
My whip got that rattle back, my whip got that rattle back

These hoes just love my speakers
Sound like Justin Bieber tied up in the trunk and kicking
Blacked out Mustang, dub edition
We in the front puffing on some Bubblicious
Just delicious, what's the business?
All we talk about is money, motherfucker, listen
Got concussive stitching
Grips in the headrest like a redneck revving up the engine
At the red light, ain't nobody fresh like me
Feel like I got everybody out here beat
Chain still swang in my algees tee, yelling out I'm pimping
Know they get the outfit free
Got the ADID, ASJS, wings on my ring like 
 got your Aviators, I'm afraid of majors
Take an eye out every time I wave to haters
Rocking imitation jakers, seal the fate of fakers
Everything is 
Ain't no other rapper hotter than me who ain't got a deal
Last year record labels didn't want to sign me now they probably will
Still got the coke residue sticking to my dollar bills
Still represent Lilburn and Lawrenceville until they put me in a mausoleum
Living in the club and the coliseum
Bout to get a cup of Xanax bars and eat 'em
Ain't nobody really give a shit when I was struggling and working for the minimum wage
But now they want to say that's it when I spit really get
When they see me on the stage they say that

But I'm all alone inside my crib, I've written some things
On a note, I hope they read it and eventually see
When I'm dead and gone they'll finally appreciate me
I guess I gotta die for them to miss me
I go online and see that they've been dissing on me
They pissed 'cause I don't call 'em when they text me
I'm a raging alcoholic, I'm addicted to speed
If this is God's plan, God damn
All the folks that I call fam
Got hands out, tryna get some money from me, I lend
Out so much and I wanna give them more to help but I can't
Nothing inside my bank account, my pocket's full of balled lint
My fans don't understand the industry, if they caught wind
How this shit really work, they'd finally see why shit did not pan
Out, I got  stuck inside, just watched my claw print
Carved in the wood from struggling inside this coffin
Bad things, looking at my classmates
Wishin' I was born like them and all I made was bad grades
Didn't graduate, mom and dad praised
My siblings, but I'm sitting in my bat cave
With the strap aimed
At my temple, trying to end the show
Can't write, it's like my pencil broke
My wife just tried to slit her throat
I'm looking at pics she sent my phone
I'm crying while the intro song is playing
And the tears are rolling down my face
Can't cancel, though, I wrote the fucking cancer song
To give some hope and shed light, to fight the shit instead of dying
I'd trade so they could live their life, 'cause I just take for granted mine
Don't see no speed limit signs, most people think I'm living my
Dream so I can see why they don't understand or empathize
If I was 26 then I'd be cool with time just ticking by
This ain't what I visualized when I was washing dishes, I
Figured I would get to sign a deal and count them dollar signs
Instead of followers online and poppin' xanny bars like imma
OD, feelin' like I'm snow skiing, every dollar got a coke ding
It's a 
Hit the lights before I sniff a line, I know it's gon' sting
Puttin' holes inside my nostrils like I got a nose ring
Curtains closing on me, man I heard a ghost speak
Telling me that I was chose to tell my story, don't leave
Go lean on your fans that are lost and lock hands
Even when you at the bottom, let them know there's options
This is God's plan

CNT official, hoe
Independent business on the give and go
Stones inside my emblem glow and glisten like a disco ball
Figuring inside the strobe lights invite this pigeon-toed
Bitch to show me tricks, she treats my dick like it's a stripper pole
Benjamins you ? to fit up in this envelope
They say we should hit the road but they don't sell no tickets though
Spittin' like I'm dipped in  but this is slow, I switched the flow
Tryna make a record 'cause homies that are wishin' me the best I put and enter to your energy
I'm finishing the enemy to Hennessey is mixed with coke
Not my dream but when in Rome I'mma give a toast to the friends that rode and we kicked in doors till the hinges broke
Went and did them shows when we didn't have dough
Tried to get back home on the  flow
When the cops came, nickel say, ""Quick, 5-0""
I would smoke and forget where I hid my dope
Then get suited up, like I was got that two-liter saluted, bruh
Scoopin' up that ice cream like a 19-year-old in a  car
Can't even flirt with a girl anymore, hard to tell what they'll accuse you of
Saying I forced you to screw me, what?
All I said, ""If you don't get this movie part
You can always get a job at the booty club, you cute"" and that's a compli-
Ment that I meant from the heart, later on this bitch is all on top of
Me but I'm way to big to try to have sex in a Hyundai Elantra
But instead she just gave me head, well if she don't swallow I'mma lick cum on the console
Uh, uh, wet your tongue, nah, need to be calm, strong
Busted a load and dumped her like I'm driving in a dump truck
Don Juan eatin' Mongolian beef and wonton
Dumplings, high, it's munchy time, my eyes look like a Vermont 
Rockstar like I'm Post Malone and 21
Some of them come hard from the john
Summer come, bubble gum, kinda want a number one hit, better get your Spotify numbers up
Sticking out like a sore thumb in the industry, some disease in the history lesson
Or a listening session, I can smell pussy like I'm in the women's restroom
What, you miss your menstrual schedule? What, you ?
Take your shit, put it in your  and put it in, ain't no BMXes
Take it, flip it, reinvest it, I might buy a studio
I might blow some stupid dough and spend it all in a jewelry store
You just don't look cute, so one of your fake diamonds in a ruby stone
Fake Gucci skully, Gucci clothing, Gucci shoes, and Gucci clone
Tripping like some , honey gripping that Coolio

Piece of Mind,Jonny Valiant Vol.1: The Mixtape,2011.0,"Piece of mind
Life on the streets of crime
Violence and people dying
It’s the blind trynna lead the blind
We can't leave this life that we lead behind
We trynna find some

Ain't no peace in the 
Peach state
Most of us totin' a loaded weapon
And children get exposed
When they grow and they show aggression
And hate
Their parents never took a second to take
A look and make sure the direction
That they were headed was straight
In tenth grade my friend tate was alive
Fresh outta middle school
They stabbed him in front of an arcade and he died
Over Cambodian gang tats
Eroded the brain back
Memories of his funeral
The moments of pain that
I endured as a teen
I done seen my fair share of scares
My crew and I went everywhere prepared
Because ?I'm harmless?
The calm side of life had been tarnished
One of my best friends took a knife in the armpit
For winning a fist fight
9 years later I still pray to god
Thanking him for letting him live life
The damage was done
Same night, people came to rush my crib
He came to fight em' with his bandages on
Cause there ain't no mother fuckin peace


Man Atlanta ain't as peaceful
As the people would think
Everybody's mind ain't equally synched
My homie ""hoodlum"" 15 got arrested for robbin
An adolescent they kept him inside corrections
Now he’s legal to drink
Sure you heard the same story before
Just cause mine's recorded
It ain't any more important than yours
It's all distorted
Were easily influence by money, power, respect
Nobody wants to work for hours and sweat
Specially when their parent’s struggle
And they house is a wreck
Every other kid around
Is getting down with a set
When I was young I was ?focused?
Down with the crips or the bloods
If not your crew was probably
Hittin liqs and the drugs
My homie ""slick"" used to show me the ropes
The dos and dont's of the streets
My homie Charles made the both of us meet
Now im his daughters godfather with pride
Can't forget the day in '99 he cried
Told me Charles had died
Cause ain't no mother fuckin peace


Everybody wanna rep with the tough guy
What goes around comes around
You better be expecting some gunfire
Trynna mature trynna ignore
The drama cause kharma been harmin'
Been leaving dad and momma to mourn
There will always be more problems
Try to handle 'em safely
I don’t want to end up in the ambulance racing
With my family waiting in the emergency room
Alotta prison facing death
Convicted murderer doom
Say goodbye to the hot sun
My boy black told me get burnt
He caught a couple bullet shots from the shotgun
Hit is bicep instead of his chest
Coulda bled to his death
He wasn’t ready yet
I guess he was blessed
I thank the lord that Im here
Lookin forward to livin
Instead of being someone
People find important or fear
Maybe then a little peace
Will be in Georgia
Or near your part of town
My eyes are watered down
Pourin with tears
I need peace",https://genius.com/Rittz-piece-of-mind-lyrics
770,UnKnown,UnKnown,"We reppin' up Atlanta 770's the area code
A part of Georgia rarely exposed
Take a walk with me while I share with the globe
The darker side of the burbs
The drug supply is undeniable, lighters occurs
And now the time is fly
Yeah a lot business is hirering
Great place to raise kids,  just for retirement
When I look at where I live I see a different environment
Nobody's swinging fist, they pulling pistols and firing
Southern bitch who gets rated
When dad's have meth labs
Some pieces going out to task force they'll embed it
They be starving for action
Crash the party, you be starve for relaxin'
Somebody drunk outside a bar and blasting
On Jimmy Gordon they trapping
Laurence  just the same
They banging, watch your colors
They gon' ask you what you claim, fuck you name
Cause everybody say they from the A
Like they're ashamed to say Gwinnett
But this is where they come to stay now

Come to my side
Homie it's time to let them know
GC in this bitch, we reppin' 770
Tell 'em (we’re from Gwinnett County)

And I ain't talking 'bout diamonds and Jacob watches
Gratuated from YA, so we're blazing jelly
Crystal meth is in feed and they just favorite wave
That they can escape, hope it takes the greyness away
They can't blame it on age
I know some 40 year old's who snort up their nose
And can't afford they four year olds clothes
More imporant to hoes, be addicted to steal
Sippin' pregnant, wonder why they live infinite 
They better know your surroundings
I suggest it and recommend it
You might be living next to a registered sex offender
Teenager say 'fuck school' is boring and lame
And boys are joining they game, so they're doing the same
Living like they ain't got no one left
They know when someone dies in your apartment
Every time they change the name of the complex
From bar's to club's, sweat water's the satellite
We got the appetite for the cash and the faster life
G town!


Ain't no  in my booze
A little burned up cross and 
From Laurence's little 
We profit and parked up a loot
And use a fellow who's runner
Like let the ancher shoot
The helicopters are follow them
Until they stop the pursuit
Don't get it wrong, Gwinnett ain't the hood
I really hate the way that it's judged
The radio never gave us the love, that we deserve
Now we the first creating the buzz
 ain't as safe as it was
We uncovered it and let 'em inside
Before me the only time you heard Gwinnett
Was on 11 and live, channel 2 with Monica 
You should take the  and precaution
No longer will the town persona be softened
Marijana's looking greener in a grinder, we cough it
We poppin' xanibars
A gram or shorts'll have you flying of the handle bars
A snort'll give you high

I'mma get freaky tonight

Me and you pop a couple E pills, we chill in the bed, just talking
Both of us look lost in each other's eyes, getting high, drinking 
We be laughing 'bout how much you gonna 
God, it's been a long time since I first laid eyes on you, I was lucky i see
That you look like a British princess
If looks could kill, I'd already be dead
Now we laying in the bed and the stress and the troubles of the world don't exist
Only us right here, as I pull my fingers through your blonde hair
Playing round with your pussy, pussy, down here
God damn, I can feel this pills start kicking in, stop reminiscing and
Started getting into me, started tongue kissing hard, I'm intense and I feel my skin tingling
When she run her fingertips down my chest and began to undo my belt
Then I undid hers, I'm about to make a meal
Like a fine dude, God, you're beautiful as her
Like a Goddess, here, let me give you a massage, just chill
Let the baby oil spill, on your skin, let the sextivity begin
Cause it feels like

Esctasy when I'm next to you
It feels like everything is cool
It feels like esctasy when I'm sexing you
It feels like everything is cool

Now we feel fresh, freaky and picking on that E, I'm in raising hell
Fucking you like I just got released from jail
Bet the neighbors know my name, I make you moan and yell
Louder and harder then I'm pulling on your ponytail
Pull it out here, taste it, that's you, don't you taste great baby, and she ain't afraid to take it
Anywhere I wanna place it, nothing like sex on the X, it's  faces
Hey, let's take it to the shower
Me and her are down to the shit that other freaks won't do
We must be geeked up cause you peed on me, I peed on you
Let me  to the wet towels and the mattress
Started kissing, ain't no kissing you in black dress
Then I said let's fuck outside, been a while since we had sex on the back deck
Covering your mouth, a couple crickets in your yard
I can see headlights, fuckers in the cars
All they gonna see is figures fucking in the dark
Rolling on the E pills underneath the stars
And it's back to the room, think I'm bout to bust real soon
Boom, shot it to the moon
All over your grill, swallow daddy's girl

F**k Swag,UnKnown,UnKnown,"15 and I back it hard
I'm in garage
And my homies riding with me and they better recharge
I talk about the car and tell 'em they won't be off
I'm off Atlanta representers and we're given the yonk
And be better this cars and the swap in the squad
Swag 'em with the lamers fuck what they laughin' in for
I'm controller bitch we just hit the gravity volume
Half of these rappers to bad to be given rappin' and all
Tryin' to dress up like a widow when it's a mighty narrow soul
Make me wanna strike another mall I'm in the bowling pit
Maybe I'm just holding out the touch got the tutors for the kids
If you don't like me going 'em bitch I'ma looney again you lil' motherfucker
I'm over and I stick 'em up they say they're yellow go and then provoking
And it's time for me to tell the difference between a rapper and a singer
Of a rock and roll band I don't think this shit is proper yet
Way too many rappers wanna look like Lenny Krevitz
Personally I think these pussies get too many passes
Thrift store shopping with the shit chore
Rockin' lips lame and your music ain't with the shit as ever
And if that will make you matters even better
I don't swear and people talking shit about the way I look every day
Long hair don't care, red pair of Air Jordan's
And I wear all black on, fuck fuck swag, you're a geek
Fuck swag, fuck swag, fuck swag, fuck swag
Fuck swag, fuck swag, fuck swag, fuck swag
You're a geek
Fuck swag
You're a geek
All these rappers wanna bite but they don't know how to write
They cause all they freeze diamond niggers tight
Every time I say go on with the metaphor
And if they wanna pause or laugh or ad live
They sway and just top off who they like
Tryin' to sound like Gucci or Future or Toochi
The dudes need a lesson before they get behind the mic
Ain't nobody buying your records in the hype
It was feeling me until they see 'em white
Now they like many raps too fast
What you slow homie, you handicapped?
What you need a walker, you hearin it, a fanny pad
What you unhappy the cheddar's back, the many pack
Or the back game, the cadillac's
I'm out to raise a barn to get adapt the cameras flash
Cause they see a star when I walk in the room
No silent, let it rap I bet you when I walk in my shoes
It's funny that I'm hot
Last year popper's was cool when you
You was too official
Whether you a hit you tired niggas
You in skinny jeans, tekkie Louie belt whip you
The client try to strip you heavy jewelry would take a pic
Post the shit on Instagram I suck a dick
You bitch look real dumb
Still slum, I don't pleasant hear lump
Bumping Big Krit and Yelawolf I don't feel pun
Rappers with no skills come on with me I kill them
You fuck with me I'm the real one
Fuck swag, fuck swag, fuck swag, fuck swag
Fuck swag, fuck swag, fuck swag, fuck swag
You're a geek
Fuck swag
You're a geek",https://genius.com/Rittz-fk-swag-lyrics

Slumerican shit...
Yeaah

The machine gonna stank
It's a Burn One beat, time to burn a sweet
In the studio, smoking something purplely
When it occurred to me
You might have heard of me
If not then follow me I take you on a murder spree
I've been reading all the comments every person leaves, trying not to take the criticism personally
Trying to tell me that I need to show diversity
I love to hear 'em try and spit a hotter verse then me
They can't cause verbally, I'm hercules, I murder beats, I murk MC
Kill 'em and bury 'em in the dirt beneath, and hop in the hearse and speed off
Leave 'em for the worms to feed, I'm in the lead, I've been hot for a hot sec...
""Got a record deal, Rittz?""
Not yet but I got a lot of prospects
And I'm gettin hotter and now they got me on the front of DJbooth.net, live and direct
I'm fresh baby '87 monte carlo
Drinkin' pineapple snapple mixed with del melado
With a little Cointreau
North side G shit
Ya'll be making pop songs, ale-alejandro
Get found duct taped right inside your condo
Bragger trying to show off weight
Everybody know you're so not paid
Your flow is so not great
Your style is played out like rappers in the mo-hawk phase
So why you playing with me homie this ain't no arcade
Pushin' the wrong buttons and jumping all on my joystick
I don't give a fuck if you're voicetress, I'll destroy shit
I ain't trying to go back to driving a fucking forklift
Get fired, tired of filing unemployment, it's embarrassing having to borrow money for gas
Getting' fucked in the ass, like a ho in a porn flick
Now you fucking with a little bit of nut and a half
Old pie face rocking tight jean with a G-shock
Need to go and get some Maybelline with some knee highs
Please guys, be wise, besides
You don't want to swing at a bee hive
Get stung 17 times
Mama la pinga you can suck it and love it ho
My manager telling me that its finally crunch time...
But I'm sick of the industry like I'm sick of these rappers ad-libing every time they come with a punch line haaaa
Fun time busting these rappers
I better calm down, I need a muscle relaxer
Can't eat, can't sleep
Just geek geek geek on ice
All night like I play for the thrashers
This-this-this some DJ Booth shit
GA music, we make movies
Homie we ain't losing...
In a old school ride, looking so brand new bitch
I'm floating like I'm driving a cruise ship
You know I got a grip on the wood grain foot on the gas
All hoes look when I pass...
They love it when I roll up
When I roll up
Every time I roll up on that ass...

I got whisky in the Dixie cup
I got bad b's on the way
I got the bed layed in the pick-up truck
If you need somewhere to stay
She said 'It don't take much to get me drunk'
And she took a shot of yay
And she sucked me off and zipped me up
And she sent me on my way 

Where my party girl at? I called her, she was on the way
She don't trip if you don't get to conversate
She ain't be begging me to take her on a date
Cause she ain't ever put her heart on stake
We ain't be going to movies, sharing popcorn
You will never see me taking her out shopping
She just want to drink get the fido popping
Me, jay d, her, Ciroc vodka
Then she started taking shots of Jagermeister and monster
Once you turned her on she was all up on top of
Me, started pouring on fine 
And started to unbutton my boxers
Started sucking on her colossal knockers on my 
Everything about this bitch I love
She loved sucking dick, fucking, and getting drunk
Getting tipsy while she sicks my duck


My homeboy just called me, he said he wanna party maine
I got a couple tickets to the Falcon's game
My girl got a girl cause she's off the chain
Maybe you and her can get it off and bang
He wasn't lying, she was fine then I saw her face
My jaw dropped, it was hard for me to concentrate
We drank  right at the  game
Tailgatin', wanna smoke? I got a kush and vape
She said she want's a shotgun, that's all it takes
To break the ice
My homie went to watch the game inside
We started kissing in the parking space
Now how ironic, getting my dick sucked by the Georgia Dome
Where everyone around me is sure to watch
I was smiling while she was down on me the whole time
She was sucking it like it was a push-up pop


Yeah girl this is suck-a-dick song
Suck it like you love it, bitch
Make your lips puck, puck like a sucker fish
She got suck-suck-suction like an octopus
She showed me how her head's got the 
Baby don't choke on it, I feel like I'm throat fucking
A deep-throat ho, she gagging me, won't vomit
She spit on my dick as she choke on it
Whole time, sipping my crown and my coke
I'm in a daze, amazed by what a wonderful feeling
Telling her lies, like girl you are one in a million
She looked at my eyes, I'm about to cum, I can feel it
Now my penis licked and got her to swallow my children
And this is 2011, new Too $hort shit
Girl, you got that kinda head that got a pimp in love
She got off her knees, and headed to a new person

Back when I first approached the mic
Get drunk, smoke and write
And put my life in the page but I hope some might
One day blow this mic the negative bullshit I ain't know was white
I'm the rapper you ain't supposed to like
Knowing if the moment is right
Around the corner so I'm about to knock them down like a bowling strike
My flow is like a bowl of lightning
And I know it's frightening and it's almost like my time's finally here
I got everybody eyes and ears on weed now, wonder why they're trying to hear
I spit a verse back then reminiscing on my finer years of high school
I was outta here
I dropped out. Said that I'm 'bout to be a rap star. So much time spent at dead end jobs hoping that a dream would come
Two but it's hard to keep keeping on
Wishing that I would have got a decent job
The money in my pocket, self-esteem is gone
But I still keep a clean pair of sneakers on
Turn it up, let the speakers bump
See me and beat become one in sequence
With the dream, can't nobody keep me from because

Ain't no telling what is comin'
When the sun is gone it's stormin'
But I'm gonna overcome it
In the end I'ma be triumphant
Feel it in my stomach
People wanna see you plummet
But i'm gonna rise above it
In the end I'ma be triumphant
I'ma be triumphant
In the end I'ma be triumphant

I got no education, no check that came in
It ain't paying the bills, I feel desperation
My dedication to this dream ain't getting me nowhere
There's really no explanation
Why I ain't made it, but now I made my bed
So I'ma lay in it, what a way to live
Dreaming that I'm eating on my daily bread
Wishing I could run a tour, rock a label head
You would recognize my amazingness
Everything I be complaining less
Just to be alive I could say I'm blessed
Life then a dozen roses. Making threats
Won't give a damn what a hater says
I feed the fire when I take it all in
Then, turn me in-to a stronger man
Fly my own flag in the wind 'cause

Ain't no telling what is comin'
When the sun is gone it's stormin'
But I'm gonna overcome it
In the end I'ma be triumphant
Feel it in my stomach
People wanna see you plummet
But i'm gonna rise above it
In the end I'ma be triumphant
I'ma be triumphant
In the end I'ma be triumphant",https://genius.com/Rittz-triumphant-lyrics
MTV RapFix Acapella Freestyle 2013,UnKnown,2013.0,"Nobody kill a beat like me, admit it
Me taking over couldn't be prevented
I'm sick, I need to see a clinic
Ain't tryna save, I take my cheese and spent it
Signed a deal and got my Buick Regal tinted
Put some speakers in it, bought some sneakers then I hit the bank - I
Withdrew some money, you could tell the teller could smell the dank of a chink guy
Like I was born in Shanghai, smoking dro in Tokyo
I go for broke that I would stop, but you was hoping so
So Rittz is heading to the top, they're like ""I hope he don't""
 of growing old like Master P and Romeo
You feeling froggy? jump, these punks don't want to do-si-do
Pinocchio rappers lying, they never sold a O
I pulled an okey-doke,  but every time you rhyme you on some desperado ish like you Antonio Banderas
Blowing up like airbags, ripping a rapper's pair of Jeremy Scott's, these ain't no Air Max
Another bloody murder, run a circle around your square ass
All you could do is just stare as we take flight
You mad this ain't your aircraft, you hate life
You're broke and barely scrape by
This industry's an ocean, I'm a great white shark they might get ate by - killed
Prey like a snake bite, so pump your breaks boy
Before I swing and knock the daylights outta ya
Running your mouth online is fun until you see my face outside of the window in your momma's house
And now you can't come out of your own home, you coward
Got your girl and we showered an hour
Bodies loose, we was screwing around 
Dog, if I was you, I would be too
I'd probably kill myself, if there was a way that I could be you
I'm finally making green, is that the reason you seem blue?
Your blue jeans too tight, things that you think's cool
I think is lame as hell - and cheesy, there ain't no Babybels
So many MCs that want to be trendy  paint they nails
They call me Ri-Rittz, I came to claim the ATL
Competition scared, people 'pare to take a L
Ye-uh yeah
Northside, A-Town",https://genius.com/Rittz-mtv-rapfix-acapella-freestyle-2013-lyrics
