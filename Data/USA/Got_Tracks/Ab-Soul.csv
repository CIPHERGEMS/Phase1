Chicks Be On Me,UnKnown,2006,"The chicks be on me (hi haters)
I know they want me
But me i'm balling
Got the fellas hating on me (Hi haters)
The chicks be on me (Hi haters)
I know they want me
But me i'm balling
Got the fellas hating on me

Hi haters, i smell at them
Steady getting wild with them, outlasting
All competition my swag is pass your comprehension
But you don't need hooked on phonics to read my moves
Hooked on chronic with a page to moto
Wait up, please bring over a few bottles
Of the best champagne , and put it on ice (ice)
If you gonna put it on her , put it on right
Black cocktail dress, put it on tight
If you looking of a man of honor
I'm robert de niro or Cuba Gooding Jr all night
Long as a  , you waking up the plummer
You go to sleep to a pipe dream
I make her melt like ice-cream
And now she wanna cold it back to my team
Which reminds me...

The Real Hip Hop (Freestyle),No Sleep Til NYC,2007,"Did you meet Rock from Cali to Italy?
It'd be like something you've never seen, literally
Soul brother, this rap shit is like a cult
But I don't give a shit, I'll wear it like a coat
You know, I'm so hip hop I love it to death
From a DJ Scratch to graffiti on yo set
B boys that could spin on they head, you know the best
I had the karaoke machine, recording cassettes
Fill up my cup like support for breasts
I reflect back like when niggas used to flow for respect
But its all marketing now, if you ain't got a gimmick
Know what’s his name, or you ain’t got an image
Probably won't last a minute
Then you wonder why these old-heads, wonder whats happening with it
Back in the day, when a album came out, yo you had to get it
Prior to iTunes my room full of LP's
Like a Ma and Pa shop
All thanks to my mom's pawn shop
Boppin' on it since birth
And I'm all in on hot
More cuts than a club sandwich
Here to cause all you industry thugs damage
Live from the 310, and we wan't more
Like eeeny miney, serve anybody
Hand me they keys, I'm only trying to unlock my dreams but
Ha ye Ab Soul

Day in the Life,Long Term,2009,"My nigga, do you have a gas can?
(The fuck I'm gonna do with a gas can, nah, nigga what?)
It's just been a long ass day, man
All I need is a gas can
(Na, try down across the street, I think that nigga keep one, I don't know)
I'm finna head over there and I'mma be right back
(Fuck what you doing, man?
Knocking on the door extra hard and shit like you just stressed out or something)
My nigga, I don't even know where to begin, dog
(What happened, man?)

Look, I woke up this morning feeling fucked up
What else is new? Like God be like, ""To hell with you""
To tell the truth, I ain't been to church in like three or fo'
Years, not months, have mercy on my soul
Threw on the wife-beater, put a fitted on my skull
Took a long ass piss, grabbed my shades and hit the door
I had half a blunt left from last night
I lit that bitch up like a lightbulb and got right
Started to orchestrate my day like a maestro
I should hit the lab, I got verses like the Bible
I heard hip hop need revival
It's been camouflaged like the mascot for Geico
In that bullshit, I took another pull quick
My mind flooded like a fucking swimming pool is
Went back in the house, raided my mom's refrigerator
But everybody's on a diet and my stomach ain't quiet
I said, ""Fuck it"", hit the shower like a jackpot
The weed got my teeth off-white like crack rock
Toothbrush from the 99 cent store
I got a million dollar smile, it don't make sense though
Threw on my army fatigue shorts and a T that say ""Peace Not War""
Now everybody eyeing me
I don't know if I need an iron or it's the irony
And by the way, I'm at the gas station now
But not to get gas, just another black and mild
Shit this half a half a tank gon' have to last until Monday
And it's Tuesday, the bitches still want me like a bouquet
I hit my nigga Agent, he want to roll up two Ls like Cool J
I'm like, ""Alright, cool, Jay""
But I gotta be at work by 3, it's midday
I can't go in smelling like weed, he said, ""Okay""
Stop by the cheap tobacco store, two swishers for a dollar
And when he meet me, we finna get high, like a greeting
He told me, ""Drop five"", I said, ""I got you next time""
Long story short, I bumped my head on cloud nine
And I'm chilly chill even when it's hot outside
Rode to the studio rather blasted
I spit like a dragon that'll leave a fan flabbergasted
That's when my gas and my check engine light
Clicked on at the same exact time I signal right
And that ain't right, I got shit to do today
Cause any day you could be attending my eulogy
Got to the studio when everybody left
I saw a note that read, ""We went to go work on Detox with Weezy F""

My fault nigga, I actually came up with the idea to write that
(You laughin' but that shit ain't funny man)
It was funny at first but

A day in the life
Of mister soul brother number deuce
Damn he nice
I'm thinking if you only knew
You could fuck with it or middle fingers up to your whole crew
Tell 'em the regular nigga said it and that it
A day in the life
Of mister soul brother number deuce
Damn he nice
I'm thinking if you only knew
You could fuck with it or middle fingers up to your whole crew

Now it's 2:58 and I'm running late for work
Running meanin' stuck in traffic cause the Home Depot is finna jerk
I been in the same position before
Manager said it better be my last time, but it won't
I clocked in around 3:10 and I'm wishing I didn't
Cause UPS just brought in this big ass shipment
And for those that don't know, I work at a record store
And I make hot records (That's a sick ass gimmick)
Finished the inventory then I logged on Myspace
I had one download and 'bout 16 plays
5 friend requests from sucka MCs making a name
I signed out and had to question my aim (You weak nigga, that's all)
This old-timer walked in and we got to talking about Eric B and Rakim
And the perm on Al Sharpton
Osama bin Laden, Obama in the office
And he looked me in my face and said I'm destined for fame
Told him I do music, he like, ""Whatever you do, do it
And don't blink, the moment you close your eyes, you'll lose it""
Word to wise, that was some great advice
That I took like I stole it, then my head sort of swollen
I guess that's why I shits on 'em like a cleansed colon
Told the rest of the shoppers we finna be closing
I locked up like Akon and hit the street
It's 8 PM, and I ain't had shit to eat
All day, KFC, snackers a dollar each
Bar-b-que and nacho cheese
I bought 4, ate 3, gave one to Top Dawg
I would've had one for Punch but he moved like a sloth
I'm back at the studio now if I lost ya
And everything's straight, you can thank great posture
Hit my lil momma up cause I'm trying to cut
But she on the rag and I don't mean a bandanna
She told me come through, she gave me head like Rihanna
And I deserve a standing ovation for my swagger
Chuck the deuce, headed for the car to finish off the night right
But it wouldn't start

Laugh it up nigga, laugh it up man
Shit ain't funny man, that's why I need that damn gas can
(Gas, nigga, you gotta put 5 dollars not 3 in)
Shit nigga I ain't got 5 dollars to put in!
(That'll get you one gallon, nigga)
Whatever man, bullshit dog, keep laughin'
(Tryin' to save that extra dollar for that menu
For the McDonalds menu nigga ain't gotta cut all the time
Nigga you gotta put the whole 5 in it)
You gon' shoot me 5 or what? Fuckin' bastard
(I know you're on a budget, but damn)",https://genius.com/Ab-soul-day-in-the-life-lyrics
Ab-Soul,Long Term,2009,"Guess it's got to the point
Where I just gotta spell this shit out for y'all, know what I mean?
See, y'all niggas hear the name Ab-Soul, right?
Y'all niggas think I'm supposed to be talkin' about mu fuckin'
The flowers and the earth or somethin' like that, know what I'm talkin' about?
I'm a real ass nigga though, on everything
Lemme break it down

I said A is for the apple on the tree I ain't far from
B is for the bottom of the bottle of hard rum
Dash to the finish line, chasing the S
Which stands for my favorite three letter word (Sex)
O is for all the ounces of dro I consume
U meaning a unanimous decision of whom
Is number 1, leaving the L which stands for Love
I spread it like the blood of fallen soldiers above

You put it all together and you get Ab-Soul-
Lutely, the best, salute me or meet death
Like Gaylord Focker met the parents of his girl Martha
We're staring at you, will depart ya
Thats the 38 special
Commentary from the King author not the knights of the round table sponsor
But amongst the dopest the west coast has had to offer since the '80s crack epidemic
I play drums for the contraband
Matter of fact, hit me
King Blue you a fool for this one
I ain't even gon' spit, just drool on this one
My saliva's way liver than yours, rappers
Shut your trap 'fore I set it
Y'all gassed up like your guns, unleaded
Yeah I said it, don't chat, no telling where we headed
Close shop when I open fire
Cause Soul known to carry the cannon like Mariah
Yes I uh
Bring it to you raw and uncut
No buts like an empty ash tray, what the fuck

Matter of fact, lemme break it down for y'all one more time, look

I said A is for the apple on the tree I ain't far from
B is for the bottom of the bottle of hard rum
Dash to the finish line, chasing the S
Which stands for my favorite three letter word (Sex)
O is for all the ounces of dro I consume
U meaning a unanimous decision of whom
Is number 1, 
leaving the L which stands for Love
I spread it like a virus, it'll kill you if you buy it

I'm with your girl playing games like
Who could get the highest at the Hyatt, real fun you should try it
I got her wet, I'll send her back to you to dry it
You ain't the flyest or the king of the jungle, but you lying
And I can see it through ya iris
Drink like I'm Irish, think like a genius
Fall back I'm all that like Kel and Keenan
Add a bag of chips and the baddest bitch
I'll be posing with a black in my mouth, grabbing my dick
Constipation is an understatement I ain't ever gave a shit
You know you hot when
You only get 8 bars in a song and it's still everybody's favorite
My fault, my god, I'm a problem like a broke condom
A editor just told me nobody was in my column
Top Dawg 4th wheel and I'm still ill
Open up the car door that look like a steel mill
I hotbox like cable in the hood
And I'm good like wrenches with a sentence, understood?
And if it's not I'll leave you with this
Top Notch muthafucka, like snot muthafucka, I'm sick

Don't get infected
Bitch ass niggas

100 Yard Dash,Long Term,2009,"Everybody get the fuck down now
Soul in the building
Yeah, we taking everything
Everything you got

Hit the deck I need everything you possess
I suggest you cooperate for this tech
Send you to the doctor to operate
You complicate my scheme to get rich
I'll put this heat to your T, let it steam a little bit
Look, when the chips get low, my fifth just blow
Anything that I could pawn, come about that, dog
It's money to be made and if you got it I'm taking it
Just run it like a Jamaican and shut the fuck up, nigga

And that might leave more than a rash
I'm coming for your ass
Please hand me the cash
Cause when I'm down on my last
I gotta re-up fast
Point me to your stash
Don't make me say it again
Before I lay you with Reagan, Benjamin Franklin, and them
Frankly I'm a menace
In fact I'm ready to blast
So whatever you got, run it
Like a 100 yard dash

Coming for you
Don't let me catch you slipping in that pretty whip you dip in
You would get pulled out
Like my dick in these women when I'm finna bust, don't test my clout
Your execution is a must, no doubt
For the longest niggas been taking my kindness for weakness
But this trigger is killing me and I'm just dying to squeeze it
Fire for hire, don't let your murder transpire
Thinking you will live forever like a fucking vampire
I arose from the dark to claim everything you own
And there's nothing between us but opportunity and this chrome
It don't take a genius to know I mean this, so ante up
Before I load the cannon up and blow your ass to Canada
Nigga


I'm wild with it, pistol whip whoever's in the house with it
Call the cops, tell 'em like a date, I'm going out with it
Give me the goods, give me the hand me downs
Tell your wife to pull her panties down
I need those too, what you gon' do?
Don't jeopardize your life, for the nigga hard body made of cement
Plus I'm loaded like this clip, off of the Seagrams
Lay you on the floor like granite
Granted your granny watching, I'm grinning like I ain't just hit 'em
Better believe it, my head's sort of off, shit
I would have robbed Jesus for the cross if I caught him slipping
God forgive him for this long arm like Pippen
The cars honk but times is hard hard and I gotta eat
Give me the watch, the Sean-John, even your sneaks
Give me your socks, your drawers, your fitted, your Boost minutes
Give me your stocks, your bonds, your blunts, your bongs
Your food in the fridge, your iPod, your celly
You say I'm wrong but I'm deadly
That's dead wrong so I'm heavy
Like Chris Wallace, regardless
You're getting stuck up, pussy
Like a tampon with a handgun, push me
But I ain't on the swings, I got this infrared beam and it wouldn't miss a thing
Bow!

Chyea! Rose
I got you nigga
I want everything
I want the jewels, the watches, the bling bling, all that shit
All y'all little niggas getting your chains robbed
I'm on you
I'm just playing y'all, I wouldn't hurt a fly
Came out dope though
Carson arsonist
Yeah, it's funny that you say Carson-Carson arsonist
That's where you're from right? Carson?
Yes, yes sir
Where is that exactly? If I looked on a map, where would I be lookin'?
Carson is right in between Compton and Long Beach

Regular Nigga,Long Term,2009,"I'm just a regular nigga doing regular shit
Doin' what I do, just doin' what I do, just doin' what I do
Just a regular nigga doing regular shit
Yeah doin' what I do, just doin' what I do, just doin' what I do

Only thing I ever seen with a purple label
Was a grape swisha, fill it with the purple kush
Pro fives all day, what you know 'bout that?
I know all my LA, niggas know 'bout that
I had the '87 with no system
Portable CD player adapter and it sound ok
Yeah it's a bucket, but I still make it around ok
I was a hustler making my rounds all day though
I keep the cool like a fridge in an igloo
Not too flashy and I ain't too ashy to class he, but that's me
Y'all niggas having menages, I was happy to score in the backseat
I had to get a job, y'all was pushing the packs
Y'all was on Melrose, we was on Am block
Y'all was shooting, we was going twenty-one no headshots
Enjoying it, you new rap niggas is spoiling it

I'm just a regular nigga doing regular shit
I drive a regular car, got my regular bitch
Still dressing the part in my regular fit
Like being regular is some irregular shit
You niggas is living the dream
You niggas is getting the cream
Ab in the back, passin' a black
Which one of y'all don't know 'bout that?
I'm on my regular shit

White shirt, black chucks
Some new tattoos, am I cool or what?
A few karats in the ear
And I make music that you need to hear
Cups up, let's toast to the year
Young old nigga, I ain't just appear
To the public, my picture's unclear
Around my neck, I don't sport chandeliers
And I don't travel in the Lear
Business or coach class, West coast I'm here
It's no benz's pulling up
No bitches in the back of the 'Bach trynna fuck
I just stack up my chips
Young black man traveling on the road to get rich
Then get wealthy, y'all don't smell me
Regular nigga now, ain't shit you can tell me


Okay, back to reality
You playboys makin' rap a fantasy
Hugh Hef could run hip-hop
How many of his hoes have y'all use his props?
In videos and whatnot, shows, entourage
How much your whole ensemble cost?
Look I'm sayin', there's nothing wrong with flossin'
But there's so much more important
Than what you sport in, how many mills you got
Or how many houses on the hill you got
They didn't love me when I was lucky enough to get new kicks
But now they all on some new shit, on who's dick?
Bargain shoppin', a walk-in closet
Until my money sky high like the mutant school
I like to give you what you're not immune to
You all look the same, I can't tell who's who


Just doin' what I do, just doin' what I do, just doin' what I do
Yeah, doin' what I do, just doin' what I do, just doin' what I do

What else could you do? What else could Ab-Soul do?
Could Ab-Soul do the 9 to 5? Could you be a construction worker?
Or is it just, is it not gonna happen, like it's gotta be music
I mean, it's really all I got man
There's not too much else I wanna do
I'm not gonna say too much I can do
But it's not much else that I wanna do really, know what I mean?
This is really my passion, but I'm just gonna ride it out
Know what I mean? Whether I'm making minimum wage with it or whatever
Know what I'm sayin'? Shit, I'm broke, I still got a job right now",https://genius.com/Ab-soul-regular-nigga-lyrics
Me & Ms. Pain,Long Term,2009,"The pain is gone!

Nah that bitch never leave
Got me waking up in cold sweats, yo I never sleep
Properly, I'm no Socrates but my philosophy is
She gone follow me as long as I live

A minute ago, I was riding bicycle
And I can buy a Now & Laters with 5 nickels
When it was washing dishes and homework, cable and bullshit
I hit the block and never left
It was exciting watching life bring light to what I'm writing about like
A lamp in a cave, while I'm trapped in this maze
But Frankie Beverly wouldn't walk in my all-stars for a day
I watched kids play and think ignorance is bliss
Then I watched Kid-N-Play on House Party
And wish I was them
See you could say I'm brainwashed
Cause I came from an era where niggas don't care about nothing
And you're judged by how much your J's cost
But me being the rebel I am, I never gave a damn
Leave it to Beaver and the rest of you suckas
I'm complex like the magazine say I'm abstract
Like a trigonometry quiz and science lab rats
If I wasn't I, you could see the pain in my eyes
I watched brothers kill brothers over system of legal tender
Deteriorating my loins with liquor looking for joy
I put my soul on a platter, enjoy
I do this for the regular people who out the in crowd
Make it popular to be unpopular
Cause if we all came together, ain't no stopping us
And it hurts me so, to think how they divided us like an island in the road
Just in control if you ain't know and yo
Lock my body can't trap my mind
I got two decades of experience on my resume
Say I don't qualify and I'll call you a lie
I'm on a whole 'nother plateau, you still trynna be fly
And that goes for the narrow-minded whose ancestor was the pharaoh
He went from number 1 to zero
Let's take it back


Nah she still on me
She stalking my innermost thoughts, I guess she want me
Cause her primary fear is to die lonely
I got no disdain for Ms. Pain
She leave me love letters sealed with a kiss
Lipstick stains on the mirror
She help me see things a little clearer
Couldn't experience joy if she wasn't near us
I remember throwing shots back 'til I collapsed
Waking up hung over in a effort to give her the cold shoulder
It never worked
As soon as I sobered up, I couldn't avoid her tender touch
Like when Hezekaia died, couldn't look his momma in the eyes
Feeling I contributed to his demise
Guilt stricken, heart victimized
Postpartum Syndrome, blacking out
She wishing it was me, she cried
Each tear was like a symphony orchestra
Beethoven over the organs, a snag of tremendous proportions
Take this recording as the truth distorted
Through the eyes of a man who reaped the fruits of her courtship
And no fortune could ever overturn the misfortunes I absorbed in
The pain made me impure like foreskin, more that I can bargain
For, still I love her forever more



And even when I die, she gon' follow my kids
Soul brother
, Ab-Soul
DJ Davis
Where'd that name come from?
Ab-Soul, it derives from absolute-ly of course
Absolutely
It's genuine, Precise was my first, one of my first names
Changed that cause of copyright issues
Then it became Absolute, changed that cause of copyright issues
Then it became Ab-Soulute, changed that cause of copyright issues
Ab-Soul just stuck, it's just been workin' for me
It's soulful, like, this type of music you're doing is soul, hip-hop soul
Is it in that sense or what?
Hey, funny story, like Soul, I added the soul because my sister was doing this production
The Dream Girls, right, and I seen Jimmy Hurley
Jimmy Hurley?
Jimmy Hurley in the part when he be like

Studio Life,Long Term,2009,"You know what I mean?
I think that, as soon as the trend leaves, you know to be a rapper
You know, which is coming soon, you know
We can get back to just, you know, gettin' new flavor, new talent
You know what I mean? People that's really out here doin' it
Cause we really do it, know what I'm sayin'
I live this
You're now listening to the beautiful sounds of Sounwave and Ab-Soul
Hey yo wizzle this shit sound real beautiful right here man
It's that real backpack rap shit right?
The cats that spin around on they head, they'll feel this
The niggas that walk around with they backpacks
Sayin' they love hip-hop
For real

5:30 in the morning I'm up
Cooking like a chef, rolling up a blunt
Momma say I need rest, I just need a puff
To put my mind in the clouds
With the birds and the planes and such, that's how I do it
Hit Wave up, lets make some music
It's therapeutic like lotion to bad skin
Heard there's a party later on, I should attend

Cause I don't get out much (I be in the studio)
Y'all ain't about much
You might find me in the club with a mixed drink
Talking to the woman of your dreams, but just think
I don't get out much (I be in the studio)
Y'all ain't about much
Ab-Soul, sincerely yours
This is my song and that was the chorus

As you can see I make music for the people
Real is relative and we are all equal
I be in the lab like a scientist mad
At the world and I chemical react, to rap
How real is that? I'm on the grind
Like a synapse, keep that in mind
It's all facts, don't enter the line
Or you'll miss it
Much like a lover in the distance
Plus I'm persistent, gotta keep it moving
Like a army brat foreign exchange student
Keep a certain level of class, your ass truant
Hit the road buddy, I'm a home study
Cause I don't get out much
Like a maniac straight jacket strapped up
Now that was a stretch, but nevertheless
I'm in the booth like concession stand
Workers and I'm the truth
And she wanna rendezvous, but


(You coming through tonight Soul?)
Of course!
That was Punchline from headquarters
He must have something for me
Beats by the batch, I can run through tracks
Ali can record me
Critics saying I'm the next Sean Corey
But I'm just Ab, like the muscle in your stomach
Trynna make history
Sit up and listen
As I kick victory in the mouth like women
She my main squeeze, like lemon
Add a little lime and you got yourself a Sprite
So I ain't thirsty for a function tonight
I'mma get it in, me and rap, she all I need
Cause you know me


So what type of sound are you? What is Ab-Soul sounds?
I just say, human music
Cumin music
Human music, like my nigga K Dot said, know what I'm sayin'
It's a real thing, real feelings, real thoughts, real situations",https://genius.com/Ab-soul-studio-life-lyrics
Blow Them Horns II,Long Term,2009,"Hey, welcome to DA nigga
I really thought I was a drummer for a second there

Follow me home, see where I was rose
Like the one in 2Pac's song that grew from the concrete
Half a line in Del Amo on cross streets
Baby baby mommas strappin' babies in carseats
Niggas failed art class, still they'll draw heat
Design a murder scene faster than an architect with a masters
One out of three niggas you know slang, that's a accurate fraction
Sunday dinner denim for packin' a mac in
Cheese in the pockets of potential rocket scientists gone bad
Like good girls movin' too rapid
Had it not been for the social status we after, our
Minds could've been on more than after hours
Some of us become legends, some are labeled as cowards
Others fall in between, I say I'm a king
Now you can disagree or kiss the ring
Either way nigga's kneel to my feet, don't be late
And if you make it in time to hear the trumpets, I
Know you gon' love it cause I love it
What's that?

My city blowin' them horns, it sounds like
It sounds like
It sounds like
It sounds like
It sounds like

Who wanna go 15 in a Del Amo park alley
Used to battle with the pep rally
Rest in peace Prospect, I miss you like a missile
I can vision you blowing up
I launch it in your memory soldier
Ask capital Z about snap capital G
How we used to wear triple A's and Footlocker T's
Two toned fitteds from swap meet
Prepaid Nokias would light up antennas at the AMC movie theater
Back when the bitches wouldn't holler
I was short 75 cent, he threw me a dollar
Can't forget J Silk, my ace boon coon
On me JT would've been proud of you
We used to mob to McDonalds every day after school
Or Shakey's for pizza if our allowance would allow it
I was wildin' saggin' with the crips I had no business
I learned, job or no job your ass better be with the business
I became an alchemist over instrumentals
I'm Jim Dear over here, that's the mayor say your prayers
It's C-A-R-son, daughter, father, mother's own
Turn my shakin' haters off and I'm right at home
And if you at home with me and hear the trumpets
I know you gon' love it, cause I love it
What's that?

My city blowin' them horns, it sounds like
It sounds like
It sounds like
It sounds like
It sounds like

How you like your stay so far?
Is it all it's cracked up to be?

If you ever caught the Carson Circuit
Ditchin' fifth period to hit the mall, then I hope you hearin' this
I do this for y'all, cause y'all can relate to me, you're my family
If you went to Cheapwood, Frog Acres, or Banana Lee
And still hit the ARCO on Del Amo and Central for gasoline
Chances are we know each other well
Not the one for wishes or for fishes, more like good
If you touched every Carson corner I once stood, then would you
Just open your ears and hear the trumpets, I know you gon' love it
Cause I love it

Sound so beautiful, don't you agree?
Really feel like, really feel like I'm the king of Carson right now man
For real, nothing y'all niggas could tell me",https://genius.com/Ab-soul-blow-them-horns-ii-lyrics

I tell 'em call me up
Like is it on or what?
Can I cut 'til dawn, or what?
A slut say she want a slice of all of us
Intelligent, say her marble's marvelous
She go down south like black colleges
I'm a psychologist, I tell her I can adjust
Anything in the world that be bothering her
Everywhere I go, guarantee she go
Pussy pop on the low, like a silencer

Back to the realest shit, cop a car, mash that
Crash that, then I'm back at the dealership
Diamonds on my neck, diamonds on my left wrist
Diamonds on my right wrist, damn it I'm the brightest

Barrage be intimate, a massage beginning with
Caress from her tongue, deep throat raw
Lot's of trauma, your baby momma
Brain is crazy—Jeffrey Dahmer
And I'm finna shoot—like a dirty llama
Big truck kicking up dust—conquer
Chocolate seats—Willy Wonka
Passenger—Pretty Woman
Direct a fact—bring your compass
You bringing Carson—you bringing Compton
Y'all bring the nonsense
We bring the real, like Pro Tools, never gross 500 mil
And we out in Brazil, in the green like Blanka
Bonkers—tell 'em Top Dawg is here

Back to the realest shit, cop a car, mash that
Crash that, then I'm back at the dealership

Whatever war you bring, just send me to Iraq
I rap like my tongue was sitting on a match
You struck by lightning, frightening, gotta be a Heisman
Trophy, low-key, the one and only
Slay a ho, play a ho like a oldie
Yup, and I'm dope like Opie
Um, so I'm out when the police
Come, like a nut, I'm a nut
For the bucks like a shotgun bust, and I bust
Venom inside the brains of young dames
Like Mr. Dash speaking to his kids on Jay-
Z—We runnin' the game
Y'all slipping like run in the rain
Ya bitches running away from y'all to us
In God we trust, at y'all we bust

Life Is Crazy,Long Term,2009,"Hey, you ever feel life is like
Nothing's going good
You know what I mean?

I know it gets hard sometimes
Just know it's all in your mind
As long as your heart still beatin'
You've got a reason to smile

Life is crazy
Never know what could happen 'til it happens
When it happens you'll be ready to face it
Time on Earth is precious, don't waste it
Life is crazy
One of your boys die, one of 'em have a baby
Today the sun shine, but tomorrow it's raining
And what could you do but see your way through
Keep your head up, baby, life is crazy

You could have all the money in the world, but be lonely as fuck
Nobody to trust, cause everybody out for your buck
Broke as a bitch, but the happiest camper
Why? Cause I'm still alive! Great answer
You could love Newports, but be dyin' of cancer
Have a broke leg, but be an inspiring dancer
Fight for your country and get shot in the head, dog
Or get caught in the Crip hood with red on
Win the lottery and lose your ticket
Buy a new Boost Mobile without no minutes
You could have a TV, but can't afford cable
Be the best emcee unsigned to a label
You could have a nice lamp with a blown lightbulb
Be married to a stripper at your local nightclub
Cause life is crazy and yes I could vouch
The truth hurts, can I get a, “Oww”?


You could have a brand new Benz with no gas in it
Horny, but your girlfriend's practicin' abstinence
Win a silver medal and still be called a loser
Get framed for a murder and don't even know the shooter
Have Internet with no computer
Your daughter could be the victim of a sexual abuser
Your father could not really be your father, but a replacement
And you don't even know, he beat your ass like he made you
You could have a job and get laid off
Break both arms and watch people play golf
Paint a picture blind or spit a rhyme on mute
A chick say you're ugly, but your momma say you're cute
Somebody just scuffed your new Timbo's, shit
You could hear this song and think I'm talkin' 'bout you
Cause life is crazy and yes I could vouch
The truth hurts, can I get a, “Oww”?

Lyrically Speaking,Long Term,2009,"My style cayenne pepper so I spit like Dylan
Speak the criminal slang
Lyrical homicide
Lyrically I'm worshipped, don't front the word sick
Sorry if I write like niggas with attitude
I'm the most anticipated
I'm what the west is missing

Sup y'all? I'm glad we could meet
I know it took a while for me to introduce my self properly
But this is me, I don't howl at the moon
I'm obviously a beast, I got fangs for teeth
Eatin' rappers like cabbage in your mamma's coleslaw
Soulbama, who you think your baby momma vote for?
I feel I'm the best that's done it so far
And that goes both ways, so far and so far
Half the kind of rhymes I write
Kind of remind me of like, lines in the Bible, I might
Be a disciple, but I ain't tryin' to spread no gospel
I wish y'all a great time under the sun
Life is short, live it like it ain't cause it might not be
21 years taught me that, nobody
Can take what I earn myself, 'til I earn myself
I was born to shine, like a firefly am I


And I'm in the best position to wreck rappers like tangles
From four angles, I see your plot unravel
I'm a lost angel, somebody got me for my halo
Around the time I wheelie'd my bike and watched cable
Exposed to the street and learned to roll to the beat
Had the gift since birth, but the curse was pre-natal
Ask my momma, she'll cosign I brought the drama
Kickin' her tummy like I punted for the Cowboys
Mat McBriar, the silent killer with loud noise
Tit for tat, I'm tic-tacin' Altoids
Fresh-dressed for the occasion to trample y'all cats
But you ignorant niggas ain't understandin' all that
Ask wizzle, I'm like a train in the clouds, I'm fly on the track

Better off alone
It's real natural, supernatural if you may
Nobody to hold
Better off alone

Time is of the essence, that's how the saying goes
Can't stop for nothing, I gotta go
Gotta kick that shit and reach my goal
Sometimes your foes is friends, sometimes your friends is foes
I don't know who I trust, I don't know who I know
I don't know who to hug, I don't know who to choke
Cause niggas be funny style and I am not a joke
I don't fuck around like sex on a merry-go
No, I bet my soul like a 40 calico
Aimin' at your skull-and-bones tell the reaper hello
Nice to meet ya, but I ain't no killer
I stay low like Shawty, far away from you niggas
Cause see

They can't hate what they don't know
And they can't take what you don't show
I be better off alone
Say I be better off alone
Cause when I'm by myself I surprise myself
I could get where I'm goin', I could drive myself
With nobody to hold
Say I be better off alone

I'm movin' in slo-mo with little to no dough
It feels like everything I do is a no-go
And I got friends, but all my friends could be so-so
Or the po-po and I never know, so
I ride solo
I ride solo
Cause I got friends, but all my friends could be so-so
Or the po-po and I never know, so
I ride solo

My  got me stressin', but I can't blame her no
She need more time, but I'm always in the studio
Random niggas beggin' for me to feature on they songs
I wanna tell them no, I'm workin' on my own
Success'll make ya true nigga true colors show
Sometimes your foes is friends, sometimes your friends is foes
Yeah niggas be funny style and I am not a joke
Like Cedric or any comedian you know
No, I bear my soul like a 40 calico
Aimin' at your skull-and-bones tell the reaper hello
Nice to meet ya, but I ain't no killer
I stay low like Shawty, far away from you niggas

I like this right here, Punch
Feels right, know what I mean?
It's like one of them type of joints where you just
Spill your soul, know what I mean?
Just put your soul on a platter, know what I mean?

I run the show (Stop that)
When the curtain open, they be yelling Ab-soul (Go 'head)
And if you didn't (Know what?)
Then now you know (What's up?)
Asshole, Ab-Soul kick up flow
I got you

Back by popular demand, it's your man
Dot, tell them what I am -- (You's a motherfucking scoundrel)
Villainous, I don't care if you sensitive
I'm different -- my only proof of birth's a death certificate
Brain like a fried egg, dick long as my leg
I don't give a fuck though, but I love having sex
Hit my weed man up, told me all he had was stress
Rock, ask DT how he wanna handle this
Now I'm in the Nickersons but I ain't got no business here
Cause I could get killed cause of the colors on the shit I wear
Fuck it though, I'm in this bitch -- acting all hard
But watch me turn impotent as soon as niggas trip and shit
I only got one life and nigga I ain't risking it
I'll probably catch cancer by twenty-six
Smoke like a burning building, never choke and if I do
That's that killa, meaning, nigga that'll murder you
That's the fire on my chest dude
""Ab-Soul you smoke too much, how it affect you?""
One time, I got so high up in the sky
That I ran a couple laps then took a nap in the restroom
Get it? I took a nap in the restroom
I'm in the laboratory, sipping vodka out a test tube
And if anybody wanna throw shots or leave flesh wounds
Tell 'em I'll be in the streets with my cleats


Show-stopper, Carson globetrotter
Rhyme like popping a Glock, get low like Flo-Rida
You know that nigga Soul keep one in the chamber
Motherfuck a judge though, there's no justice for brothers
My nigga B Slim in the pen like permanent ink
And like my first LP, I'm waiting on his release
Machete sharp on you niggas every sixteen
I should charge per bar like a store that sell dumbbells
I ain't finna kiss the bride, but I'm finna unveil the truth
Niggas be trash like junk-mail in the booth
After who? Y'all know that
So I think I'm wasting a gift if y'all gon' rap
Am I the shit? Read my black ass lips
Like confessions of video vixens we all wanna hit
Kick it like a creative recreation on some everyday shit
And I don't even own a pair, but it's fair to say I


Hit you up like Pac
Then when you get to heaven ask Biggie who shot you
I pity you rap dudes, you niggas in my way
You're talking to the father, don't play Marvin Gaye
Better yet, I'm the author-slash-martyr with a probable cause
To ball harder than Coach Carter starters
Pack more green than the team that gave the boot to Brett Favre
And you could hear the horror in my aura
Monster, like the one under your bed
Say your prayers 'fore I shed through your epidermal layer
With intentions to hurt you like a technical foul player
Even in a scrimmage I make you hemorrhage
I got a scheme to get richer than movie screen depictions of Bruce Wayne
No bats, just game
In fact, you niggas wanna know why you're lame?
I gets more fly, you stay plain, how 'bout that?
More figures than your calculator could count
I got more flavor than garlic on niggas' recording
I hate y'all, I'm sick of rap
Punch, hit the space bar

Largo termino...
Long term, bitches
If you can compare yourself to anybody else in hip-hop who would it be?
And this is not comparing them to be side by side
This is somebody that you see great music inside them
And every time you hear them it makes you wanna work on your craft

That special pinhead who stay by my side, homie
Prospect holding a spot in the sky for me
That's on my life, real niggas never die, homie
Now all eyes on me, I see you niggas watching
Hoping that Soul sell out like a fucking auction
I'm in the laboratory working on a concoction
I ain't rapping, I'm a chemical reaction
To you niggas slackin'
Like suit bottoms, yo what's happening?
I'm back again, dope shop open like a cabinet
Chauffeurs could get arrested for trafficking me
Like I'm wrapped in vaseline and go for 18 5 a key
At 18 I was a G, sneaking in clubs
Breaking down dubs and the whole hood showed love
Never thought I would make it this far in this game
Now every bar is insane, but not the Long Beach game
And I don't need a big chain or Escalade on 6s
Cause I can roll with Juice and take all of your bitches
And you ain't never seen a top dog so vicious
I'm a star, right? Women hand me they wish-list
My reign is endless
You would need an umbrella that lasts forever to witness
My lyrical fitness
My physical's eminent
I know Caucasians that compare me to Eminem when he thought he was infinite
But this ain't 8 Mile and I ain't Rabbit
But ladies used to do me shady after math classes
Black lip bastard with black glasses
Bad habits backing up in the back of cab stratus ass magic
I'm Jay, more graphic, uncensored
So if your kids have it homie, it's promotional use only
And after this you owe me, like the letter after N my friend

Mic check, mic check one two
This is it right here Wave, this is it
Thank you for tuning in, hope y'all enjoyed yourself
Long Term

Motherfucker this is Long Term, let me explain to you niggas
I'm here for the long haul
I'm fly as Curtis Pilot, you ever saw part of my Carson
Joggin' if y'all lost, but I been dedicated since back then
Started out with the double-time rhyme scheme I got from Twista
I couldn't quite convince the public, I was the one that'll put us up on the map
Throwin' away raps in a trash can
Fillin' my notebook up with my quotes, but the doors didn't open up
So I slowed it up
Found my niche, got my bars up
Black Planet freestyle chattin', get your guards up
Boys in Black had me hip to punchlines and all that
Came back with some hard stuff
What I was like, sixteen I think?
Killin' 'em,  box sealin' 'em, like the rooftop
Not quite a god emcee, more like Jay Reed, give me the oowop
I don't care who drop
Still found room for development
Before MySpace views were so relevant
Hey Soul, you ever think of sellin' it?
What? Your soul! Heavens no
Unless it cost that at Heaven's door
I pave my own way, no steppin' stones
My first break was playin' songs for Tory Crow
The judge looked out, we even shot a video
Shout-out my man June, can't forget my nigga Bones with the bangers
It's all love over here player
Before MP3 players could play us
I had a five-star tablet full of classics
At a time where every rapper was a gangsta or somethin'
Sort of became cliche some thought
From the suburbs where we do dirt and hope we never get caught
Hittin' a lie, why would I lie?

I've been watching you, to whomever this may concern
I can see your grind, what you got is well deserved
You gotta get up, get out, and get it, you can't always wait your turn
And it may not happen tomorrow, you gotta think long term

I told myself like back in '05 I give this rap shit two years
But I'm still here
I've fallen in love with this hip-hop thing
Our relationship is real rare
The problem with a lot of newcomers is sad, but understood
I'm tryin' to make a great song, they tryin' to make it out the hood
I'm tryin' to be honored with the Pacs and Biggies
And they tryin' to see face on TV like, ""Momma, see me?""
But it's a whole lot easier now
The Internet'll let the world play your media now
Your girlfriend cousin got a mixtape comin' out
And he got a beat you leased, but the producer is out of reach
This kid asked me how to make a name for himself
I told him I'm still tryin' to find a lane for myself
I could've lied to him and sold him a bunch of BS
But this is where the letter ends, before I go, P.S

What is long term?
Long term is everlasting, long term is the thought of a future reference
Long term is everlasting, long term is the thought of a future reference
What is long term?
Long term is everlasting, long term is the thought of a future reference

Skinny nigga but a nigga's pockets fatter

Put another ladder on top of the ladder

You should see the corny shit they do to impress me

I run it like a track meet, but you never met me
Attract heat like black clothes or crack co-caine
My brain on the grain like a veggie

You irritatin' like a wedgie
In particular I'm a don, mega like the maker of Friday
With nothin' to do and no job
This chrome that I hold will leave you holy like you know God
Sin City, murder in abundance
Where mothers look like they always smell onions
Ride by the elementary and kids cussin'
And it's nothin' new to us you could do to us
So get your weapon or player just get to steppin' up the stairway to heaven

All the way up to the LA fitted up on my dome
They won't leave me alone (And I know)

I can't help it, I'm on my sixth whip
 gotta say some slick shit

Every pour I was forced just to take a few whiffs

And money can't even get you marks accepted
You need to chill with the g talk

From the 1950's where we'd rather let our guns spark
Chill with your colored scarf, shots take your caps off
Close range with the burner, nigga, 'til your skull 
Get with shit, Top Dawg's one and only blue pit
All black four fifth dumpin' at your loose lips
Yeah I'm trippin', best believe a nigga crippin'
I'd even rob Obama if I catch the nigga slippin'
Catch a nigga dippin' nigga
Ridin' through the fifties on chucks lookin' crispy
Man I wish a nigga tempt me nigga
Bustin' 'til it's empty, done with the plan
Need to take a trip to hell and have the devil start prayin'
Hammer start sprayin', lead into my rifle
Make a nigga bleed just for fuckin' with my cycle
Bigger than the Eiffel
Tower, havin' power niggas softer than a flower
Time to make these cats devour


Yeah homie, you already know how it's goin' homie
It's west coast homie, best coast homie, better smoke
Know what I'm sayin', left side of the map, know what I'm sayin'
Straight up, come to the hood, fuck with us
Know what I'm sayin', straight up

Cause I'm close and they far?
They ain't raw, more like medium-well
Do like a loc in all blue in a room of Pirus
See for yourself cause I do

Froze over by the flow, niggas started with snow
Ride the beat like skis down an aeroslope
Finna start an avalanche, find shelter for your quotes
Shh, I'm on a whole 'nother boat
Y'all niggas need to get a grip, your whole shit a joke
I'm off the top, y'all slow
Take it back a couple notches while I travel up
Ab-Soul, bang the gavel or what?
No judge, I'm just in this bitch, actin' nuts like cashews
And I rap dudes around gas axles until they blow up
Fire, matches, you want to test, uh, Ab, fantastic
And I never stop, never slack like zoo bottoms
Y'all stuck in leather hats
Back in the eighties, I was doin' this shit
Still ain't had no babies, but I'm the man
Got my girl tied up
And I land somewhere in the Bermuda Triangle
So you can try angles if you want, but I doubt it
Reasonably, yeah, uh, leave your fleet and all types of shit
Like dogs in the motherfuckin' fall, no hydrant to piss on
Ab-Soul, don't piss me off, dog
Cause once again it's on like (?)
Got (?), I'm way (?), y'all niggas actin' like May, dude
Minor hot, but I'm June
So y'all'd stay tuned, Ab-Soul got it from a day out
Correspond to the the day I lay in the tomb
Y'all know what it is, absolutely the best
Yeah, no diamonds on my wrist or my neck
I'm still fresh to death

Like real tight
Check --

Yeah, come come now
Soul Brother No. 2, I'm the one now
Sun up to sundown, still kickin' that shit
Put your gun down
I come in peace like a extraterrestrial being
Eat me a meteor and walk across the moon barefeet
But don't nobody rhyme like this no more
Call me the 2010 Rakim
I got soul, there's more in store
Feel like a CVS, open 24
Spent nights tryin' to overshadow my shadow
For niggas tryin' to block my light like a solar eclipse
I bring a knife to a fist fight and when I cut a record
So when I cut the cheese, shit you know what it is
Mr. Absoulutely the most incredible at this
So adjust your bass, your treble and then

Yo, turn me up some
Yo, turn me up some
Yo, turn me up some
Turn me up some, turn me up some
Yo, turn me up some
Yo, turn me up some
Yo, turn me up some
Turn me up some, turn me up some

Finna break this blunt down and burn me up one
Then sip on this Remy 'til it turn me up some
For me it's more difficult to be simple
Than it is to be complex as a lot of apartments
You niggas comedy, I'm laughing at you probably
We are not the same, there's no strand of monotony
Between you and I until we die
Revelations say you either fry or fly
And it's hard to find God when you ain't never seen him
It's pie in the sky and there's bodies on the cement
And I know you lookin' at me like, ""You don't speak English""
I bring the heat like a phoenix, a son under Phoenix sun
And I'm rootin' for the Lakers when they play the Phoenix Suns
I ain't really into sports, that's just where I'm from

Come come now
Pac told me fuck the world, I'm 'bout to cum now
I've been a pro, but now I'm profound
Propane on posers, restraining from the doja
Imagine if I smoke, I probably come up with a quote
So heavy you'll forget every album you heard from Hova
Or 2pacalypse I'm Hub City's novelist
Come and get your scholarship, I'm taking kids to school
A pool full of spit, dive in, I'm 'bout to drool
You'll drown trynna backstroke on concepts that I wrote
I was a black sheep, but now I'm just a goat
And I'm 'bout to elope, married to the game joe
This is hip hop at its finest, where'd you find this? In a Ziploc
Til the wheels fall off, fuck a pit-stop or what not
Where my tear drop? I murdered it
My pot-holes is turbulence
I'm in the sky wit it

No sleep, do it with your eyes closed
I can see your vision from Del-Amo
Poppa took the television, but left the radio
Ill niggas, wack niggas, what's the ratio?
Is this shit degrading or inspirational?
I'll have you know I must've wrote about a thousand rhymes, a thousand times
I give you my word

Cause I just gotta be heard
I just gotta be heard

Said I gotta be, yes sir I gotta be

Soul Cry,Long Term 2: Lifestyles of The Broke and Almost Famous,2010,"Do it sound tight?

Considered a fuck up all of my life
Too smart for my own good all of the time
In kindergarten I got a kick out of pissin' on my classmates
And I recall getting ass whoopings every couple days
I had a Power Ranger bike I wheelied in the street
Got grounded for a month for spray painting it green
I went to middle school and started slacking in my studies
Before the rise of AIM the gang bangers were my buddies
I wasn't fit for it I needed a tailor
I still went for it
It wasn't out of anger
I needed to be accepted in my neighborhood
My mamma couldn't tell me nothing
End of discussion
I ain't shit
I must be constipated
Cause I ain't shit
Naw, I ain't shit, I ain't shit, I ain't shit

Things ain't always what they seem
If you look close you can see
What's your perception of me?
Is it good? I wish it was
Cause I ain't shit
You may think I'm eating
But I ain't shit
Naw I ain't shit, I ain't shit, I ain't shit

In ninth grade I started off on the right track
Got a few A's but then I bounced right back
Wasn't aware my main thought was what I should wear
Now that I think about it nobody really cared
I grew up in the church but barely paid attention
Read up on Malcolm X and started questioning religion
Became a rebel
I still believe in God
I just doubt the authenticity of Jesus and the Devil
I got my first car and started smoking black and milds
The smell is like a bell in Hades, hella loud
Then it was Newports and Kools on my way to school
My girl hated it but still kissed me in the mouth
I started ditching class more than I attended
I was walking a path that I had not intended
It looked as though I was mad, becoming relentless
My mamma couldn't tell me nothing
End of discussion
I ain't shit
I ain't attracting no flies man I ain't shit
Naw, I ain't shit, I ain't shit, I ain't shit

Cause I ain't shit
You may think I'm eating
But I ain't shit
Naw I ain't shit, I ain't shit, I ain't shit

I got kicked out, crept back in
If I wasn't fucking I was fussing with my step-dad again
Oh yeah I rapped, didn't take it that serious
But I flowed like an ocean among my peers
Dreams of going off to college in my younger years
Then the whole thought of it sounded nuts I had dumbo ears
Did about a semester then I was outta there
Said if I get one song on radio, I'm outta here
Knowing that low ratio of successful entertainers
I choose a goal, people with skulls would say was brainless
Started smoking weed as soon as purple kush was famous
Shifting my setting eventually as I went through changes
People I seen my whole life appeared to me as strangers
Created a voice through my music and now they speak my language
I was in a Jay Rock video for less than 15 seconds
All of a sudden niggas that I looked up to see me as a legend
Now I step in clubs and sidity bitches give me hugs
But back in P.E. tennis a nigga got zero love
I'm just a hard headed loser
My mamma was trying to save me from stalling out my future

I'm outta sight, outta mind pimp, matching dimes
Don magic Juan, roll the greenery
It's what I need, where my shin and thigh meet
Huh, yeah I'm such a fucking stoner
Everywhere I dwell you can smell the marijuana odor
What the hell? (What the hell?) That's that fire, man
Call the fireman, or the supplier man, tell him slide a gram
(soulo, soulo, soulo) You know we smoking that dour
Two titans back to back call 'em Twin Towers
(Haa, Haa) And anytime I'm on the ground
I stop, drop, and roll... then burn it down!
If that's exactly what you're doing right now
Put your lighters up, and wave them round and round
Puff, puff, give, real shit
I'll probably run through seven pounds, Will Smith

Pass the blunt, Pass the blunt
Man you tryna smoke or what?
Four deep in the Hooptie finna roll the windows up
Pass the blunt, pass the blunt
White paper, Optimo
Backwoods, Dutches, Swishers, even Phillies filling up

Smoke some, bitch (Repeat x8)

Black Hippy, sticky in the peace pipe
No I'm no Ru, but I'm throwing up the peace sign
Smoke fill the room every time a nigga inside
And when I'm off this I feel like the H.N.I
See no seeds in my product that's a no-no
I'm three dollars short and I'ma need it for the lolo
I owe the weed man down the street, also
I got the munchies and I haven't ate, ocho

And when your bitch call tripping, pimp man this is what you say

Got something in that optimo swisher got me feeling right
I'm feeling like, Transformer forming in the highest height (Yesss)
Michael Thriller night, moonwalk in flight (yea, yea)
Heaven or hell, I be good in paradise (uh, uh)
I give you satellite (uh huh)
Or some other shit, Prada Louie printed shits
Getting money growing off the tree, dough dough
You never smoke but always want the trees, Popo!
And that's a no-no
I get your son, I take his lung, I let you keep the photo
The swisher burning keep me earning everything in slow-mo
Be the posse, no 'parazzi, kick it like a dojo
Wake and bake, elevate
Let's see how much more you can take

And if this month I earn a thou then fuck it I'll buy a vowel

Can Anybody Hear Me,Long Term 2: Lifestyles of The Broke and Almost Famous,2010,"I've tried to do right
Seems as though the only way is selling my soul
It's getting hard out here
Does anybody feel me?
Cause I'm drowning in shame
Trying to maintain
Wide awake chasing my dreams
Is anybody out there?
Can anybody hear me?

Sometimes I gotta ask myself what do I do it for
Is it to cover up the fact I'm really insecure?
See music made it possible for me to be somebody
So if you had to say yourself
Is my intention pure?
Am I the next Shakur?
Or an attention whore?
Am I Big in his prime or am I premature
Does anybody feel me or am I too far to reach
Like the edge of the world, from Redondo beach
Some say I manifest destiny when I'm on these beats
Others say I ain't flashy enough to shine
You need a chain at least
And you can be more hood
You got niggas on both sides
You acting like you ain't good
Well you from Carson right
Ras Kass was tight
And you hot
But can you make another 
Soul on Ice
Everybody trynna tell me what I shouldn't and should
But will they still wanna chop it up when I go 'wood

I've tried to do right
Seems as though the only way is selling my soul
It's getting hard out here
Does anybody feel me?
Cause I'm drowning in shame
Trying to maintain
Wide awake chasing my dreams
Is anybody out there?
Can anybody hear me?

While niggas searching for a pot o' gold
I compose the God particle my heart is stone
Pumping cement through my veins
Taking everything for granted
Who can recognize my pain
Y'all niggas never did hear me
So I quit calling out to niggas
Let y'all deal with it, I figured
Why cast my pearls to swine
If you don't know about grapes
I couldn't tell you 'bout wine
I couldn't tell you 'bout these lines
They just hit me like rain
Without a cloud in the sky
On a summer's day
Ay, I guess it's how I was raised
Acquired knowledge, while my peers frolicked and played
My Prodigal Son ways, disrupting my coming of age
Future looking dim and Ab-Soul wear shades
I'd never cover my face
I look death in the eyes, I didn't blink one time
I never felt more alive than that day
But who's to say I'm different
And when I speak niggas scared they ain't listening
And that's beyond me
But I believe it's far more menacing
And the truth was stranger than fiction once reality get to kicking in
It's like the modern day Noah's Ark, they took no note
Their bad heart came back and bit them no their hope floats
That's why I'm fishing through a sea of niggas
They don't hear me and I don't see 'em niggas

I've tried to do right
Seems as though the only way is selling my soul
It's getting hard out here
Does anybody feel me?
Cause I'm drowning in shame
Trying to maintain
Wide awake chasing my dreams
Is anybody out there?
Can anybody hear me?

You see, it's like the Titanic scene
With the rescue boats
It's less dramatic in that
I can save y'all with quotes
I dropped the gym adrenaline accelerated my pulse
And I can say it's dope but what do I really know
Currently the word is that I'm too abstract
I can barely get my engineer to mix my tracks
I'm trynna provide you with facts
Trynna keep it real
But y'all not interested in that
You're more concerned with my appeal
You rather see me on YouTube, unconcealing the steel
Or on WorldStarHipHop, with diamonds in my wristwatch
Or a media take-out
Victim of a media stakeout
Cursing them out so bad
Most of my words were blanked out
I hate it when my name is mentioned with the same niggas
Who other than their DNA are the same niggas
They in the same circle, fuck the same bitches
Shake the same hands, man I'm trynna expand
For me it's gotta be to catch a flight back to Carson
I'mma need a passport for it
If you don't wanna hear me do your boy a favour
And press fast-forward, and listen to the emotion in the chorus
No this ain't a song outfit
But if it was, I wore it
Come from a different cloth, rippin' my bars
Pause
With my bare hands I can move the earth
Just cause I said it in my verse
That's the power of words
You may not ever get what I was trying to accomplish
I might not ever get to do a song with Jay
And hear him brag on Hot97 about how I'm so honest
I'm ready to throw in the towel like laundry day
But I feel as though I've reached the point of no return
Like an expired thirty day warranty
And I deserve to be the best artist you heard like cattle
And I put that on, Herb the 3rd
That's my word",https://genius.com/Ab-soul-can-anybody-hear-me-lyrics
Mayday,Long Term 2: Lifestyles of The Broke and Almost Famous,2010,"This shit right here is like.. Heh
This, this shit right here is like the calm before the storm
Like little kids playing in Japan before Hiroshima got bombed on
Yo

I'm sick of holding back, Jay told me go harder
How else am I gonna prove I'm the number one author?
Sometimes I wake up in the morning mourning for my father
And the more I think about it - the more I get stronger
It didn't kill me, it contributed to the growth
I take five dollars - contribute it to the smoke
I rather get high while I'm living at the bottom
But even when I rise, you'll see my red eyes
Like the last flight to the night
See I done soared through the air like fighting a knight
I've seen bad times, and I cherish the good
My sentences give life, man, fly me a kite if you would
I'm so introspective
All it took was a pen and a little reflection
But what does it to take to be number one?
Will one of you motherfuckers please answer the question
I'm starving out here, and I haven't prayed to God in so long
He'll probably try to charge me for a blessing, am I wrong?

Hold on, mayday
Ab-Soul, you driving them crazy
Ah-ha! Fooled you
No matter how heavy the situation, we pull through
Yeah, yeah I do it for the love
I do it for ya'll
I do it cause I'm the one
That's it, that's all

I never gave up, niggas want me to raise up
But I'mma kick it 'till my fucking flower bed's made up
Tear a fucking stage up every time we hit a venue
Eating all rappers - Vibe magazine is like a menu
Shall I continue? You said yes didn't you?
Seven star general, all from being lyrical
Cause how is it that what I'm saying give you a visual?
I promise all competition candlelight vigils
Quite the individual, deliver the mayhem
Like swine born in the springtime, I'm borderline psycho
When I come up with lines to bite your
Fucking face off, ya'll ain't trying to face off
Ab-Soul, divine with the rhymes
Bring sight to the deaf and sound to the blind
Ya'll do it for the light intertwined with lime
I do it cause on the mic ain't none of ya'll better
Top Dawg, y'all mice, taking all of ya'll cheddar
Am I right?
Fucking right, yeah!


Cause 2010 I'm trying to ball nigga
Like shooting jump shots in the mall nigga
Cause my skies are gray
You could say I'm a goose in a pond of some hard liquor
I tend to go overboard with the metaphors
Still walking in the shadow of my team
Jay Rock finna blow - 2010 fo sho
And K-Dot and C4, but what about me?
It's kind of hard to say you top notch
Parking your bucket in front of your mom's spot
Still getting dime bags on credit
Girl wanna go out, all you can afford is IHOP
It's fucked up right? That's where I'm at with it
I'm finna crack like a egg hatch, stand back


And in the midst of the bullshit
I'm still nothing to fool with
The type of nigga bitches wanna get cool with
Primarily cause of my future in music
They seen me shake Nipsey Hussle's hand
I hear them whisper to themselves, ""he's the fucking man""
I do one song with Glasses
And I'm the talk in all the high school classes
In the studio with Game
Just soaking up game like he's standing in the rain
So when I'm in the booth (Mayday!)
Better yet, I'm finna make it my new AKA
Yeah, Willie B what up?
Shit's hot sorta like a temperature nigga, keep it up
Uh, and please turn your speakers up
Cause Eric Wright couldn't make it look easier
Rest in peace, my nigga
But since you've been gone, I've been killing these niggas",https://genius.com/Ab-soul-mayday-lyrics
Drift Away,Long Term 2: Lifestyles of The Broke and Almost Famous,2010,"I seen mama make a left on main street
Had to flag her fine ass down off instinct
I'm in the Mitsubishi Mirage in dire need of a car wash indeed
She in the lil' clean Camry
I'm hoping she'll look closer than what she can see
About me, I caught her at a red light
She rolled her window down and greeted me with a smile, Sunny Delight
I'd drink a whole glass of her ass
(Gotta get the number Ab, don't let your chance pass)
That's what my conscious told me, So I said boldly
""What's up with you and me?""
(Hahahaha) She laughed to herself and the light turned green

No my car ain't new!
But if you gimme your number baby
I'll get back at you
And we can drift away
We can drift away
Drift a-way baby, baby, baby
We can drift away

I was tryna brush up on a honey at this kickback
Drunk throwing shots back, pretty face, ass fat (ass fat, ass fat, ass fat)
So I got behind that (behind that, behind that)
She didn't mind that
She slow whining, I'm co-signing
I said, ""I hope they play Birthday Sex""
She said, ""It ain't my birthday yet!""
I said, ""I don't give a fuck about that""
(Gotta get the number Ab, don't let your chance pass)
And then my conscious spoke free
I grabbed my Motorola Razr and said, ""Lemme get your math, ma?""
(Hahahaha) She laughed to herself and pulled out her 3G
Ahhh

No my phone ain't new!
But if you gimme your number baby
I'll get back at you
And we can drift away
We can drift away
Drift a-way baby, baby, baby
We can drift away

We had a performance at the club
I'm hype man, I figure I'd get some love
I'm off the orange juice with the Goose
Spotted a hottie on the dance floor getting loose
Approached her like, ""You just my type
I had to holler before I hop on the mic""
She said, ""Is that so?""
And I said, ""Fo sho
I know I got shades on but I can see your glow""
I felt a connection cause baby got close
(Gotta get the number Ab, don't let your chance pass)
My conscious talked to me and laughed
So I said, ""After the show you tryna come to the spot?""
(Hahahaha) She laughed to herself and said:
""You know Jay Rock? Oh...""

No I ain't that dude!
But if you gimme your number baby
I'll get back at you
And we can drift away
We can drift away
Drift a-way baby, baby, baby
We can drift away

Yeah I know Jay Rock, yeah, yeah

Yeah
Lifestyles of the Broke and Almost Famous

""Herbert Anthony you need to get you life together""
That's my momma bothered by, how I'm living life like whatever
They say im pressed for time, but I don't press the issue
I just stay on my grind,chain smoking marijuan help me free my mind
What a coincidence, like feeling guilt stricken by your innocence
In a sense im livin in my second childhood
Dont pay a lick of rent, where I eat, sleep, and shit
And when you twenty-two that don't sound good
Maybe if I went to school it'll be cool
I've have something to fall back on if this rap don't crack
Perhaps i'd have a better story had I sold crack
Lets go back, to Carson high fluctuating my goals
Writing rhymes through the lecture knew I should've took notes, yo
Sometimes I think im running in place, chasing hopes
So is my name as Ab-Soul or is it average joe
 (x2)
All this commotion goes in one ear, out the other
I'm still gone make it, one way or the other
(quit acting like a kid herb, gone be a man
It's a man's world, how you suppose to feed your fam
You need to act more like an adult, pull up your pants
I know you do music but what's your plan B man)

If I knew when I was younger would I grew to know
I coulda tackle things more different, coulda been more defensive
Coulda been more responsible, coulda been more persistent
But I didn't and I ain't repenting
My parents wake up in the morning to a cup of coffee
Then go off to work. It kills'em when im still in bed snoring
Only if they knew, their young boy was in the stu
'til like 5 AM cookin up classics to make them
Proud as house niggas that could stay in
That was rather brash, but you can replace these scraps with straight cash
I told jay I'mma buy her a house one day
I'll probably send Katie and Kira off to college too
But right now I'm broke as a joke, I should do comedy
Dude, I need a job, somebody hire me fast
So I could win my girl over, she probably cheatin on my ass
You motherfuckers better try and snatch her while she up for grabs


(Ab-Soul talking)
Its like real difficult to articulate it
It's like you got your goals. You got your aspirations
Your dreams, and you chasing that, you pursuing that
But in-turn it cost for you to sacrifice alot of your availability to go out their and get this paper, nah mean?
Its hard to say you a man still and livin at your momma house..
Yo, I had a conversation with my step-pops
Basically inquiring the time frame when I'mma pop
I told'em I ain't know but I'm determined to blow
Not like a fluffer, more like plaques that's platinum and gold
Thats on my great-grandmother
He shook his head and said:
""I don't know much about the music industry but whats been said
The people ain't making no bread, lets be more realistic
How you gone take care of a wife? how you gone feed your children
Im on my knees everyday tryna provide for yall
I bought that car that you dippin, but you don't chip in
You shouldve went to UCLA, like your cousin Jay
He got a big signing bonus, every year like 80k""
I looked him in the face and said ""It ain't about the money

Passion,Long Term 2: Lifestyles of The Broke and Almost Famous,2010,"Game keep changing, Tats on faces
Look close, you can see how rats run races
You find it's all about the cheese at the other end
They forgot the simple shit, like strengthening your limbs
I listen to the radio and I begin to cringe
I eat MCs, find a spot inside my fridge
When y'all was tricking off, taking bitches to the bridge
I was sparking up a cig, tryna tighten up this bridge
The hook is real catchy and the verse is interesting
Now all I need is a feature from Drake or Lil Wayne
I never move O's, like say a Gucci Mane
I'm broke as a bitch, and I spit like I'm insane
But what a nigga gotta do to shock the whole nation
Sign to ROC nation, become a fucking Mason
Monopolize, prophesize an abomination
I'll Do it, but you thought it was just music?

Passion
What the fuck happened
Somebody talk to 'em
Motherfuck rapping
(oooooh, where's your passion)

This for my niggas that log on to All HipHop
And listen to niggas they never heard cuz they love Hip Hop
I got so much drive I never need a pit stop
It's scarier than a whole hour of Alfred Hitchcock
I'll probably make your bottom lip drop when my shit drop
I'm in tip top condition
With a hustler's ambition
Ounce after ounce, me and Jizzle keep twisting
Until we get twisted like the caps on snitches
Just know our little passion will take you a long way
Like Pussy & Patron can salvage a long day
I dive head first in a verse and swim away
And pull a pen out and throw a grenade at your brigade
Like a Skin Head, you're a barber that can't fade
I'm up all night trying to come up with something crazy
So while you sleeping like a baby
I'mma seal up the game, no relation to the navy


Uhn
I wake up in the morning and compose a rhyme doper than the last time before I even opened my eyes
Open-minded to the truth, but not naive to what is fiction
I probably love this more than my bitch, say I'm trippin'
Leave your ass in a ditch, if you can dig it
You mad cuz I found my niche and you didn't
Too fucking bad
Fuck with Ab
And so you know, every sentence, it is from the Soul

The doors are closing, the sky is falling
If you ain't got passion then why even bother
The new generation is all out of order
Somebody save them so we can move forward

Yeah
You mighta caught me walkin on annalee
On my way to work, I ain't no jerk, you can wave at me
Faithfully I strafe from all the make-believe,pray for me
This the shit they make-up make me think maybe its maybelline
They will not disable me, even Kane afraid of me
Now niggas wanna network like A&E
City on my back like a superman cape would be
Ab-soul, asshole, why you act an ass for?
You ain't even got your own pad you a tadpole
It's a future ahead of you, why you looking back though
Frontin like you in the front when you in the last row
Microphone check 1, 2 are you hearin this
Curtiss king will tell you I'm a lyricist, lyricist
Been a trip before I caught a flight, alright?
Why you think I'm always smiling, im nice
Rapper's delight, that titles suffice
I dont even think he existed but my idol was christ
I too have a passion for what I feel is right
That's why I get high as a Wright brother and write

Cause I just need'em to remember me
Before im dead and gone write my name in history
Mentally, im meant to be, infinite, energy
Martin Luther King of Carson, peace to my enemies
And cause this is Long Term 2
And every one of my dreams will all come true
This a journey we all go through
And if you can't cut it then it's all on you

I had to be about two
All I remember was Charlie Brown and Dr. Seuss
Momma read me a bed-time story every night
Comprehended so well I thought it was all true
Thats all truth, 20 years later
I became a wordsmith like a kid from will and jada
Took a fifth of henny to the head and thought ahead
Why they worrying bout my buzz, I ain't a insect
What the fuck, yall got me fucked up
(what the fuck, yall got me fucked up)
Don't get a nigga misconscrued
Cause I get loaded like a brand new pistol, ahhh shoot
Long as you knew that I'm on the pursuit
Of greatness 'til I lay in a tomb, im raiding
The game is weak, knowing its painful and not short
However long it take just know im not going


(Heaven ain't far Soul)
Yea, I swear to god I wrote this on annalee
On my way to work, im late, I know my momma mad at me
(PEACE) to all the homies formerly known as casualties
Prospect, I miss you man I do this shit for you
I revise my timelines see how I do
2000 I was cool, '01 I had fun
'02 I recorded my first song and I was sprung
'03 I was deep, '04 I had flow
'05 I signed a Street Beat with no dough
'06 I met punchline, Damn I thank punchline
He saw more in my music than metaphors and punchline
'07 DudeDawg told me I was family
In '08 you became a fan of me
'09 I went around the country in a rock band
Now its twenty-ten yall, get a catscan dawg",https://genius.com/Ab-soul-long-term-2-lyrics

Starving artist, rib-cage showing
Give me the loot or give a semi to shoot
Then after, pass the Absolut
I'm trying to hit a lick, probably knock out your tooth
I'm fully equipped with a fully negative dick
Finna get a nickel for every cent if that makes sense
Uh, head shot, you're dead Ock
If feds knock alibi is I was on Ed’s block

Grimy with it I hope the motherfucking disk skip

Got the flame, if I aim it'll burn you to ashes
Got the blunt rolled all I need is a spark
And watch the paramedic roll up with elastic
Stretcher carry your ass they'll bury you fast
You venereal and a dick head, how bout that?
Blowing more O's than a Cheerio cereal bag
Serial killa for the skrilla; maniac
And like when the camera take a picture I'm finna snap
Your fucking head off your neck then reattach it back
Brainacs get they mind blown
Can't have a migrane when your mind gone

I ain't looking for my enemy but if he in the way I put the pistol in his mouth
Let him get a taste
Fore you eat say grace, you know I'm coming with the blammer
Not to shoot, just to use it to beat you like a case
What's the root of all evil? A baker said the cake
Gardner said the green, you know what I mean?
I'm sick of digging in my pocket for nickels and dimes
Somethings got to change or I'm resorting to crime
P95 in my palm .45 in my waist

Grab somebody and move your hips

Go ahead, move your hips

She is the one that I've been waiting for
All day I wish I could be with her more
Wish I could physically feel her for real
And do what I wanna do to her
And she would never tell me ""No""
She would tell me go far as I want to go
Anything I need just let her know
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe (moe)
She would even catch a tiger by the toe
Just to put a smile on the face of Ab-Soul
And that's so amazing
That I know...

I got my mind on the prize, wheels on the roll
Eyes to the skies, bless my soul
Rush.... Rush

I was on Avalon, in a Avalon
With the window down, two notche for TV on
Yeah, that’s what he be on
California sunshine, heater on
I laid the text but sometimes niggas read it wrong
Still a slave to the page, no beeper on
If the sky tell lies then let me lie (where?)
In the same home that the reaper own
Fire, feel the degrees rising in this song
Keep the degree pollutin' your speakers till I’m gone
Became a tree, mama your seed is growin'
Niggas see me, see where I’m going
Uphill, and I keep going
Through the red lights, through the roadblocks
My headlights blind the opposition
Ain’t got 200 on the dash but I’m doing half

When I roll through the city it gives me a rush, rush
Swear to god it makes my adrenaline rush, rush, rush, rush, rush
So when you see me in the street I’m always in a rush, rush, rush
I’m always in a (yeaaah) rush, rush, rush
I’m always in a rush, rush, rush, rush, rush (yeaaah)
So when you see me in the street
I’m always in a rush

Rolling down central, in a bucket but I’m feeling presidential
Breaking down swisha’s, filling 'em with indo
Ho’s trying to date a nigga like info's
I’m flying right by 'em like holla back
Hoping they won’t see me through the tinted windows
Bending corners like I ain’t got a bookmark
Ain’t got the most paper but I’m booksmart
I’m speeding through life like fuck it all (My nigga)
I got my word and my fuckings balls (My nigga)
And that’s my word I’m a fucking ball (My nigga)
Control the earth so I can have a ball (My nigga)
I’m moving at a fast pace and I ain’t slowing up for Nathan
Paparazzi follow me but they can’t keep up the tape
You ain’t talking longterm and you ain’t talking my language
Don’t trip, we still popping like a stainless
Fo' real
When I roll through the city it gives me a rush, rush
Swear to god it makes my adrenaline rush, rush, rush, rush, rush
So when you see me in the street I’m always in a rush, rush, rush
I’m always in a (yeaaah) rush, rush, rush
I’m always in a rush, rush, rush, rush, rush (yeaaah)
So when you see me in the street

Still A Regular Nigga,Long Term 2: Lifestyles of The Broke and Almost Famous,2010,"Longterm is defined as...Fuck it y'all already know

Chyeaa, the long awaited, highly anticipated (L-T-2)
Haha it's human music; nothing more, nothing less
You know what type of nigga I am, I just borrowed a dollar from the homie
I'm back...I know you missed me

Long Term the sequel, my swisher sweet is equal
My cup is full of brown like the skin color of Hebrews
And this is not a test, no I'm nothing to mess
With, just find a cliff, and please don't watch your step
You know just what I rep, Top notch to the fullest
And TDE's my fam, for each of them I catch a bullet.
I'm strolling on Del-Amo Boulevard towards the Arco
To get another Black & Mild, my lungs look like charcoal, Yea I know-
Your whip is like one of those in car shows, I still got '09 tags on my Mitsubishi mirage
No gas, need new break pads, new tires to inspire to get money like Arabs
Jewish lawyers, NASDAQ stock holders
But for now I'm broke, I need a fix, I be borrowin' the homie's clothes to go to events
Just so I'm camera ready when they be takin' flicks, I admit

I'm still a regular nigga, doin' regular shit
Got my regular car, got my regular bitch
Still dressin' the part, in my regular fit
Like being regular is some irregular shit
I ain't changed for shit (no)
Still walking 'round with a pocket full of motherfuckin' change
('m on my regular shit!)
Homie! x4

No chain, no watch
No diamonds, no Glock
No rap sheet, no new drop whip, no top
No Gucci, no Louis, no shopping on Melrose
I asked for the bitch number, she looking like ""Hell naw""
No record, no street credit, I'm probably in debt
No work, Herb never move right off his step
No G-4s, no clearports, none of that
I got a standby ticket
As for the flight, I just missed it
I'm trying to stay optimistic
In the midst of the struggle
Cause y'all make it rain, but I just slipped in a puddle
See my life is simple: I rap and smoke weed
Eat when I can, have sex when I need
Grab a fifth of E-
And J and I'm straight
I don't meant to be vane but hey I must be the savior
And if you're playing this tape, you're playing it safe
But I'm getting escorted by the armed forces to home plate (Soul!)
I am only the antonym of fake, if you're antenna is up, then you may feel the same
I see your 24's and them motherfuckers great
I even like the green and red stiches on your J's
The LV on your belt buckle, Audemar arm
Purple label, VIP table, Chandon
Black car, model broad always on the scene
5 Star continental breakfast, presidential suite
But to be the best, do I gotta have those things?
Is that the only way that I'mma make these hoes sing?
Make these niggas feel me and put on my whole team
Shit, that'll compromise my own dreams
A fortune cookie read; I had a future in music
I wonder how many people got that very same message
An A&R told me that I look like a star
And before I let it get to my head, it's best I confess it

Yeah, look

Thou-thought it was love, not just a mockery of
We been close since snot noses
That's some old shit, yeah no shit
You chose your path. Me? I was focused on this rapping
You was trapping and I wasn't mad
You was nickel and diming, all the while
I was getting pennies for rhyming
You was eating at Tony Roma's, I had only Top Ramen
I can smell the aroma when you pass
It ain't only the potent doja you just passed
Cause now you tryna go legit, and pick up a mic
All cause you heard So Far Gone and that shit sound tight
You see me buzzing in the streets so you figure a feature
(Should) give your name a boost like the prepaid cell phone would
I lay my verse and the verdict was:
Homie got off, but Herb murdered Cuz
And instead of studying my tactics
You turned dyslexic and now you're looking at me backwards
That's straight madness, we were compadres
And now this, what can I say?
Guess that's what happens when your stick has the shorter end
The strongest niggas start to bend

I thought it was love
I thought it was real
I thought you were being sincere
I thought you'd forever be here, yeah
I thought it was love
I thought it was love
I thought it was real, yeah

She knew his track records
Took a chance on his past
Cause he was sure to
Make her laugh when she was sad
Enjoy the company, especially when her legs were spread
He was a guilty pleasure
Loved it when they were together
But nothing lasts forever
Been talking for a minute
Feelings start to develop, at first there wasn't any
She's entitled to a title but he isn't ready
For commitment, not yet
A year and a half passed in the relationship
But finding messages in his phone from miscellaneous chicks
Lies on top of lies
She was blind, didn't realize
Notice that ignorance is bliss
She put too much time and effort off into him
For it to end up like this
So she forgives what he did
But she doesn't forget
Everything that he puts her through
Through it all, she don't want it to end
Started out as a visit
He was merely a friend
Now her heart was his home
Where she felt he belonged
Was scared of being alone
Held those emotions within
She went through his phone
And she caught him again

And other than a nine to five I never had no work

I wear the underwear here, it's best you know now
When Queers interfere I can feel it in the air
They ain't gotta make a sound
Ain't shit sweet
But the swisher full of weed where my thumb and my index meet
You don't quite cut the criteria
We keep trees on us like LRG

Mass hysteria walkin' across the street, cause
They never seen a nigga so concrete
And You can understand that right?
You look a little dumbfounded
Believe whatever you looking for I done found it
I can show you the real and I can tell you the grind
But even T-Pain get this shit overnight
And If, nothing else remember this

The night is still young like a nine year old kid
Finna hit the Dale's Liqour, and cop another fifth
Of Hennessy, for my personal pleasure
A took a sip, a little head dripped, so I wipe my lip
Luckily it didn't spill on my tee, I'm well-known for that
But the bitches still holla
'Till they go hoarse like Kentucky Derby
The power in the Porsche, all I need is to kick back
So I can just chill like a six-pack, of coors, of course
As soon as I walk up in the door I'm yelling out

Somebody spike my Sprite
So I can feel larger then life
I call this House Party 5
What's popping for the night
What's popping for the night, What's popping for the night
What's popping for the night, What's popping for the night
I call this House Party 5

Yo my party don't stopping up I hit 'em up
I said wuddup, I said wuddup, he said (not much you)
You know what I'm 'bout, what's going down for the night
(Party at Ashback house), I said what
He said (yup), shit y'all be fucked up
Stepping out, like an accident, roof level
Outta elevator in a skyscraper in the clouds
I hung up, ran to the bathroom to clean my Air One's up
I would rock the Timb boots but they all scuffed up
I looked in the mirror, seen my swag was up
Don't play swag out, so I had to adjust
Fast forward, I seen so many cars pulling up
Hoes pulling down they skirts, niggas with
""We can't lose"" on they shirts, you would assume they take it to the dirt
Some of my niggas real killers, put you down to Earth
And they down to Earth, and we Chris Rock
The party like it don't stopping up


And the party don't stopping up
It don't stopping up, don't stopping up
Don't stopping up, don't stopping up
Yeah, and the party don't stopping up
It don't stopping up, it don't stopping up
Now put your hands up in the air
If you tryna put it in the air
Got bitches shaking ass to the left of me
Got homies 2 stepping to the right of me
We got Hennessy, got Nuvo to spare
If you trying to go, we can take you there
Got bitches shaking ass to the left of me
Got the homies 2 stepping to the right of me

Yeah, another round on me
Look at this women move her booty around on me
It's 2:15 in the morning but we up
Finna hit the Denny's, tell 'em hook a scrambled up
Pissy drunk if you didn't know my nigga, no my nigga
Higher then a spirits, of the un-living
In the mist of everybody fucking up the homies house
Think B.I.'s party and bullshit, a fight broke out


And the party don't stopping up
It don't stopping up, don't stopping up
Don't stopping up, don't stopping up
Yeah, And the party don't stopping up
It don't stopping up, it don't stopping up",https://genius.com/Ab-soul-house-party-5-lyrics
Budget Ballin,Long Term 2: Lifestyles of The Broke and Almost Famous,2010,"You could find me in the hood poppin'
Or in the club stuntin'
There is no
Other option
And you can't tell me nothin'
The camera keeps flashin'
So
I'mma keep flauntin'
Cause what you don't know is I'm a baller on a budget
(And I)

Defy the odds when I step out the house
Pull a chick lookin' like a nigga fresh off the couch
Then I pull up in that white thing
But I don't mean it as if its something to brag about
Shit, my car's just white man
Sharp as a tack, in track to get at the club
Bottle service reserved
Go on and po' you a cup
I sip until I throw up
My hands dance in the cut
By myself I ain't lying
Attracting all of the sluts
I got a chip on my shoulder
Like there was chips in my pocket
There ain't a cent in my jeans
But you might smell the ganja
I must be living a dream man
You say I'm her dream man
So why take advantage of her
Fuck her to dreamland
(???)
Absolutely, but I love it ya'll
Still drink that cheap shit
That smells like rubbing alcohol
Still going half on a sack
Hitting pretty broads
Taking off pretty Vickys
With the matching pretty
Bras

You could find me in the hood poppin'
All in the club stuntin'
There is no other option
And you can't tell me nothin'
The camera keeps flashin
So I'mma keep flauntin'
Cause what you don't know is I'm a baller on a budget

I hold it down, they know what's up
The party ain't stopping
So I'mma keep frontin'
Cause what you don't know is I'm a baller on a budget
(And I)

Give em' the chills
Rollin' on hot wheels
It ain't mine, it's the homie's
I'm just keeping it real
Say I'm phoney baloney
Even words tryna bone me
I got the hood on my back
Ain't gotta tattoo it on me
But as a matter of fact
I'mma tattoo it on me
I know you thinking I'm immaculate
That's accurate, homie
(Word Up)
Like the magazine with all of them posters
I keep a Halle Berry in the ashtray full of roaches
(To smoke up)
Pass the light
I'm finna have me a night
If your wifey's hitting the club
Before she leaves, hold her tight
Look her dead in the eye
Tell her you love her to death
And hope she don't come home with black and mild on her breath
It's Ab-Soul, the best dressed nigga in debt
Got chicks fresh outta high school, adult swimwear
(Yes)
I know I make it look simple
Like it ain't really nothing
Cause it ain't really nothing, no

You could find me in the hood poppin'
All in the club stuntin'
There is no other option
And you can't tell me nothin'
The camera keeps flashin
So I'mma keep flauntin'

Do what it do, running the spot

Ain't a dollar in my wallet
And nobody tryna rob me

Tell myself its too good to be true
These niggas like, ""Ab, I bet it feel good to be you""
But I'm just living my life, like T.I. and Rihanna

Indubitably!

Still trying to get this loose leaf, lift my legal tender
'Til it's tall enough to reach god's slipper, whatchu think?
Big Dipper nigga quite the constellation 'cross the nation
So ahead I graduated then came to your culmination
Like my little sisters, but these rappers more tender
No pen I don't bowl nigga, you act all bold like an eagle
When you small as gnomes and trolls nigga
Mediocre, novice, throw salt, garlic
I'm big willy, you craw-fish,
 flow silly, retarded
Gimme a helmet, 
like I play for the vikings I be (what?)
Rollin' up that poison ivy, and I don't look at it at all
If it ain't fulla tetrahydrocannabinol, I'm a cannibal dawg
Jeffrey Dahmer pull your skin off if you look at me wrong, it'll turn me on
I'mma turn this up like a thermostat when it's cold as fuck
Am I cold or what? I'm a cobra, venomous
Bad to the bone, break all your ligaments
Everybody gettin' it, ain't nobody innocent
In your pinnacle is benefittin' zero for your penmanship
A missle in a barrel and I'm splittin your apparel
Red Light, Help! We'll sing carols
Vernacular stupid, you're inadequate foolishness tickles my amusement
Don't know if I'm an artist or a Harvard law student
But I pass bars like kids in candy stores
I'm a carnivore and I are the best, absolutely genuine
When it comes to synonyms I'm a thesaurus Rex
Read more, learn more, change the globe
Don't let no one tell you no, yes you can the more you know
You understand how much you don't understand, so now you know
I ain't the pope, but listen what I taughtcha I ain't gon' cross ya, hope I ain't lost ya
I found my utopia, little Cîroc, little fruitopia
I spit opium, cut ya up, fill the room up with sodium

Oh let's do it, oh let's do it

That intelligent shit I influence
I approve it, dictionary music, yaaaaaaaaa
Oh let's do it, oh let's do it

That intelligent shit I influence
I approve it, dictionary music

Cataclysmic words, pattern thrash 'em with the verb
I put passion in my work, ethic stretch ya like a paramedic
Mashin' through yo' turf, even if your habitat's obscure
I'll surely make it out alive, precisely how I did at birth
You're miniature, minuscule, I'm a minister, April Fools!
I like literature luchini, indica and fried zucchini
Where my niggas with they beanies on, cocked like a mockingbird
I'm sharp enough to correct a correctional officer
Carp ya like a carpenter, barbecue your body parts
I bet Waka Flocka Flame never met a Charizard
Barbarian, that Samaritan, neanderthal
A package of blacks, a package of matches, and a can of aerosol
No time for no R and R, that sativa got me up

Fame,UnKnown,2010,"The fame
The fortune
The need to be important
Will exist as long as the Earth is in orbit

Far from a Frankie Lymon but I'm feelin' the scrutiny
The fame, the bitches in they visions is screwin' me
Cause they don't see Soul, they see commas
*Boy you finna be the biggest*, get her a pre-sale ticket
I used to sit and stare at my phone and wait for rings
Like professional athletes or any wife to be
Now it's ringin' off the hook cause I wrote a tight hook
The list goes on man I could write a book
But you know the popular sayin', ""Be careful what you wish for""
I just wanted to move people
I didn't know it'd come with this whore
Got me steppin' outside like menthols
Well sellin' your soul's the end all be all
I'm just tellin' the truth people
But you could prolly only feel me if you're involved
Just know what you in for

Some people wonder why I wear shades at night
I say cause in the dark, they're still that bright
I see my enemies, they see me too
You wish you was me like something's wrong with you
They say I'm becomin' such a household name
That everywhere I go I'm sure to feel the *Fame*
Some people wonder why I wear shades at night

Tell me how you supposed to feel when you walk in a room
Everybody swellin' your head 'til it's as big as the room
You still ain't made it but it appears to be comin' true
At a time you tryna find what the world is comin' to
And don't forget about your family you would think it was all love
They waitin' for you to fuck up to blame it on your moms
Like she did a horrible job, he don't look too good in the eyes of God
But you know the popular sayin', ""Be careful what you wish for""
It just might happen
I never thought I'd make it this far, when I was young I used to wanna ball like Chris Paul
Hoop dreams converted to writin' hit songs
To some of y'all it's just rappin'
And I wrote this over the toilet cause I was pissed off
No shit

Some people wonder why I wear shades at night
I say cause in the dark, they're still that bright
I see my enemies, they see me too
You wish you was me like something's wrong with you
They say I'm becomin' such a household name
That everywhere I go I'm sure to feel the *Fame*

The fame, the fortune, the need to feel important
Will exist as long as the Earth is in orbit
Michael Jackson died just a few days ago
Some people say ""Malpractice"" but just imagine
Sellin' a hundred million plus copies off of one project
Grown men fallin' out just to touch your fashion
You become an object
With or without an objective of your very own
That type of attention can drive a man mad so be careful what you wish for
This music is what I do 'til I die it's what I live for
So if you do it for the jewels or the new tennis shoes
And not to be mentioned with Pac, Biggie, and Nas
Then you do it to pollute
I'm Captain Planet with my pants saggin'
Tell the truth, rewrite it, define it, and spell it too
Make sure you shake every hand and take a picture with every fan
And do whatever you can do

The fame'll consume you
The fame'll confuse you
Make it look like everything is an optical illusion
The fame will haunt you
Listen what I taught you
Even on your day off
The fame is on you
The fame ain't expensive
But the fame will cost you
The fame is your friend
But the fame will cross you
Take what I say as a warning
Precaution
From the captain blockin' moonlight with my sunglasses
Bastards

Yeah
Yeah
Be careful what you wish for
It just might happen

That shit up on Limewire, type that shit in

One time for your mind!...
How do you do? Enough about me how about you?
I'm in any and everything that you do
I'm worldwide with it, You never heard of me?
Your deaf, everybody caught up in my webs
Spiders getting jealous, I can make you feel connected
I can show you whatever you wanna know in a second
You got a clique? Well I'mma click away from everything
You host a club, I host information on everything
Cut from a different cloth, Microsoft
So I can communicate with you all
I like to stare out windows for days
I'm a browser, we might be on the same page
And I got impeccable Aim
I could show the world your message even when you away
Know what I'm saying?
Oh you think I'm insane?
You better not still be trying to remember my name
At first when I came, I moved through the wire
And now I'm even airborne but you can't even see me flying
I'm the messiah of science, the titan of technology
You couldn't go a day without acknowledging me
Your kids stay up late just to holla at me
They ain't gotta be over eighteen
To peep my sites, I show 'em how I get down
Wouldn't believe what they see when you ain't around
I got all the access from sex to addresses
Soon as it gets uploaded I gotta show it
Shit, you heard of about it, I gotta know it

I got like six new friend requests on MySpace, yes!

I kick it with the Mack
Told you about my web, I can even make my web chat
I'm also known invading your privacy
You know, credit card fraud, piracy
Them my homies, they be idolizing me
Cause I move so smooth on 'em
If he did it, she did it, I got news on 'em
And I ain't stubborn, I let people shares they views on 'em
Could even show you how to get to 'em if you want 'em
I been seen the future moving in my direction
I kept America online, no question
And I ain't stop there, I made a foreign connection
So you can meet people anywhere you select shit
My plan is to have my hands in everything as if I don't
Get rid of pens, pencils, and paper with the holes
Some people act like they don't love though
This rapper named Ab-Soul, he a prime example
He always got something negative to say about me
When he with his friends but he couldn't go a day without me
Leave him with a stale face when he checks his MySpace
He a disgrace, How he expect play without me
Ain't got no budget for radio
His Day In A Life video, I made show I made him known
And I could do the same for you
You can even Ask Jeeves, he'll tell Yahoo!

Yea just go ahead MapQuest the directions and print 'em out

See, I'm the black Humphrey Bogart
Puffin' Blacks though, hella smart, asshole
See, this my culinary art how I cook up such food for thought
Clear the kitchen, it's finna get real hot
Uh, MasterChef, no accountant, cashin' cheques
You niggas ain't half of half of half of my best
Uh, champagne wishes, some cream to my Swishers
A Nicki Minaj for two five-star bitches

And everythin' I said, I swear I meant it
Listen, fascinated by the tactics of a Jeffrey Dahmer
Eat your ass up, cannibal for the dollar, intangible
I'm at the top, ramen noodles, that's understandable
The Last Samurai here to tear a guy apart
Tie a piece of barbed wire 'round his heart
If he gassed up, he get boa constricted until he fart
If he talk and it don't correspond with his walk
He walk the plank
Captain Hook went hard, Peter was gay
You'll never, never land a spot on our roster that way
Not a Rasta, but a smoke, like, a whaler, they know
I'm servin' niggas, tip the waiter 'fore you leave the table
Goddammit, just found another crack up in my halo
Are you comprehendin'? Am I condescendin'?
Or am I kindly sendin' you a message kinda quickly?
I never get too busy to get busy
Simply stuntin', your missus can't miss me
Engine gunnin', headin' for the finish line
But not the sneaker store, I need that first place prize
The blue ribbon in the sky, I'm Stevie Wonder gettin' high
What you even speakin' for?
You're iller when mute is on, carry on

Are we ready? I am
'Cause it's all about control, and I've got lots of it

Soulo ho, the one and only
You niggas know me, your bitches want me
Determination, I got a grip
9-5 locs, I am not a Crip
Blood, sweat and tears, hotel tiers

Said I was the underdog, turns out I'm the secret weapon
We can see you half-steppin', I should somersault
Some are salty that I made it in the way I did
'Cause I really did everything I say I did
Let me tell you why I'm vexed
The same reason why I'm stressed
The same reason why I'm blessed
I stopped prayin' and I started plannin'
I stopped playin' and I made it happen
We mapped it out and now the map is ours
Raised my stats all from records, check an almanac
Thank God, Punchline knew I had a knack
Down to die to get my point across like craps

Bringin' the terror and tearin' the concert down
The spliff will get lit up 'til we look like we come from Chinatown
Missin' Alori Joh, it's been a minute since I saw her smile
She's the reason why I go as hard as I do now
Fuck a foe 'cause I'm focused as four bifocals
I'm prone to leave a vocal booth totaled for the right total
The bad boy, you boys pussy as Total

I never gave a fuck, my name never came up
But now that I done came up, I think I'm King Tut
I told Punch I'd probably get assassinated by the government
He probably think I'm sniffing cocaine and some other shit

And hit some trees, why not?
Where your head at?
Hope it's in the gutter like mine, not where you find rats
Talking 'bout where you find ecstasy
Come on have a little bit of sex with me
Can I hit it in the morning, 'til the sun has fallen

Oh shit, might want to make you my misses like I lost it

You could put a nigga in a tomb (one) peek-at-you

'Til Victoria's secret get all wet
And Victoria's secret safe with me

Came in the game with a dollar and a dream
And a AK clip with an infrared beam
I pop that trunk, make everybody scream
Put a missing punk on everybody's screen

My dick is big and my nuts is swollen
I don't know if you've noticed but a nigga be rolling
With a bad bitch and the bitch be rolling
Dolphin pills and Moscato spills
Everything she need to get her thrill
No Hennessy on the bartender bill
Just good wine and a good place to chill
I feel I might get loose tonight and fuck your girlfriend
I mean I feel she might come through tonight, plus her girlfriend
In a 5-Star suite with a 5-Star freak
Slinging that dick while baby eat
On her punani, ooh mommys, look at yours bodies, I'm geeked
Having a good time
Put my pain in a mothafuckin' bottle
A chain and a diamond ring don't feel the same
If a nigga ain't got his eyes closed (eyes closed)

Ab-Soul and AAhyasis live

Hello, good morning, this is more than just a feeling I reckon
I cut on the beat and if I feel it I wreck it
I heard I got fans in France playing my records
I'll visit as soon as I can, you can bet it
Don't forget the dash in my name, when you print it
It'll make me feel bleak like Jay's apprentice
Niggas looking real meek soon as we step in it
I'm a god MC, not a polytheist
And why is your reaction always so obvious
Let a reverend run in my Adidas
He'll see that despite all his dislikes, I am like Jesus
Don't follow 10 commandments, but I don't seem to break
To many of them either, try to understand me
Obama said “Yes we can,” but that can't be
Cause we was raising money for his campaign, T-shirt, plates, and mugs
But won't do the same in our own community, what the fuck?
I said what the fuck?

And it ain't nothing new, all I do is eat, sleep and shit
Reflect on my life, find the perfect words to rhyme it with
Depend on my sight, ain't concerned with what ain't been confirmed
And I got the right, think I've reached the point of no return
It ain't nothin' new

How's it going, good afternoon
I'm doing swell I hope I can say the same for you
It's funny though, I could have just told a lie
And made it true to taint the mood, you think I am what I ain't (ooooh)
Like a saint or fake
We could go toe to toe, your choice it's no debate
Soul brother number 2
And every single one of my dreams here coming true
I try to smoke weed to give me the fix I need
But it always ends up with me running out of tree
In sheer disbelief, tell me how I can get high
As the sky and keep my ear to the streets
At the same time, no diamonds in my watch
Can I still shine, will anybody watch?
If I could hold you attention for at least a minute
You'll gain so much wisdom you'll need to see a dentist
Grow up in my society see why I'm a menace
And obviously ominous to your opinions
Call myself the King of Carson like I hold dominion
Hoping nobody notices that I had no permission
I don't mean no disrespect when I express
My vision was meant to connect, not to reject
Don't press eject, I said don't press eject
 (Soul!)

And it ain't nothing new, all I do is eat, sleep and shit
Reflect on my life, find the perfect words to rhyme it with
Depend on my sight, ain't concerned with what ain't been confirmed
And I got the right, think I've reached the point of no return
It ain't nothin' new

It ain't nothing new to me
Should be nothing new to you
Let's accomplish the impossible
Free in body, mind and soul

No idea's original, it's nothing new under the sun
It's never what you do, but how it's done
If you base your happiness around material, women
And large paper, that means you're inferior not major",https://genius.com/Ab-soul-nothin-new-lyrics

More alive than a newborn unicorn in the sky

Niggas don’t think
Niggas don’t think

Understand exactly what it takes to be creative
And display greatness the dedication it takes
The time consumption the stakes if you say it ain’t high
That’s a blind assumption and open your eyes or something
Defy the odds
Multiply with nothing grip the skies
I open minds in hopes that you open your mind
Holding my fro and scoping the scene out
And spitting sixteens spitting my spleen out
Thought I had it made but ain't shit clean
And I been chasing this dream since Wayne made Bling Bling
I drift off in thought and teleport to Beijing
Pushing 25 but still feelin like 18
With more insight than a encyclopedia
The Carson Arson warm enough to fight anemia
And I’m just warming up
Got em sweating bullets big enough to load the pump


Strategize, just fantasize
They don’t emulate they just antagonize
They don’t illustrate they just be writing rhymes
They don’t demonstrate they hide behind their lines
And on my rise to success
I’m just searching for the perfect concept

T.D.U.D.,Longterm Mentality,2011,"You would have thought I was infatuated with being underrated
Instead of renowned, got me feeling like King David before the crown
I too have my views like you
Look what I do to stand on stages in front of crowds
I need food but I'd rather smoke a Black and Mild
Get back in the booth and spill my heart 'til I bust a valve
And that's the truth, hand over my left titty
I had faith in hip hop before she met Biggie
Just take this shit a day at a time
I thought I was on after Day in the Life
But you know our shit get put on hold after reality strikes
You ain't know I knew how to bowl
How you eat when there ain't even a bowl?
My stomach sound like something in the jungle
My mind saying give it up, the people saying don't go
It's easier to leave when you ain't got no dough
Cheap champagne wishes and thirty ratchet hoes
All up in my videos 'til you niggas see the vision (I ain't playing)
Guess a nigga never checked out detention
In my second childhood making music from the soul
Just so you know, crack a backwood
Fill it with that good and take a toke

On and on and on and

They think me and these other rappers
Have something in common, God bless them, all men
I ain't stressing, I'm all in
They in Lois Lane, I'm Clark Kent
Go back to what's happening
Jay Rock finna drop and walk you all around Watts
Kendrick keep getting chased by cameramen
And for the first time, you've seen a Hoover Crip on the charts
As for me, I'm still an amateur
Venting, looking for the right Canon
To capture your attention, I need honorable mention
Most of all I need to exist in the fourth dimension
But niggas say I sing better than I rap
Who gives a crap about all them damn metaphors and diction? (Fuck that)
Took a step back to reevaluate my steez
Went to friendzone alone and wrote a gang of trees
Labels calling for everybody except for me
Like I ain't got the recipe, like this ain't my destiny
You know how much my family expect from me?
Especially considering I'm literally chasing a dream
Told G-packs, I'mma slip through the crack
Get that cream, that's a fact, yo
Whoever thought I'd get to write for Dr. Dre?
He probably thought it was trash and threw that shit away
But it's a new day
, new possibilities
My time'll come sooner enough
No hostility, that type of shit'll slow you up
Don't get caught up in all of the marketing to show you up
He from Top Dawg?
 He more like a pup
He ain't from the streets, where the fuck he come from?
Who co-signing him, don't believe the hype
You niggas can't see me, can't call me on Skype
I'm all bite, no bark
, a Benz to a Go-kart
All I do is go as hard as adult film co-stars
So on and so on, never lag, never that... you can't see? Look
They told me to break a leg, so now I'm an amputee
Give me fifty feet like G-Unit's sneaks
Soul brother number two times whoever you bring

I can't even let it breathe
I ain't got a second to spare
But I'm definitely hair, like fur
Do you concur?
I'm only the seed of Herbert the Third
And Lakeisha conceived in Korea
Word
More of a reason to be a overseer
Four years older than Helina, man we're getting old
In four years you'll be a senior, at least I hope
And hope is all a nigga got
You put your all in something, then that's all you've got
So why would that lollygag
Popping four fives, pop a tag
There's more to life
I know my wrongs, I know my rights
And while you jog, I travel at the speed of light
I see the light, shades on
You got an Audemars with diamonds in the face, huh

Cause time is of the essence
You ain't got time for no comments or no suggestions
But just begging my pardon, enjoying my party
Cause Ima run the world til my clock stops homey
Yeah Ima run the world til my clock stops homey
Cause time is of the essence
Praying destiny is manifested

Question, how many milliseconds in a year?
31,558,464,000 and yeah, I googled it
But which one of you would have counted?
I thought it was astounding
My biggest fear is blinking and missing a whole year and thinking I was tripping
Now that's a disappearing act for your ass
Wesley and Sanaa didn't have it that bad
My mind travel so fast that I can see the future today
Trying to escape like a fugitive in 2088, play it safe
Preparate, you still trying to segregate
You better be trying to get your ticket on them arks they about to make
Know or be amazed, you caught in a maze
You need your hair done, you need the brand new Js
You need your nails done and you need 28s
So you can skate on them hoes, fuck if they say no, there's plenty more

Cause time is of the essence
You ain't got time for no comments or no suggestions
But just begging my pardon, enjoying my party
Cause Ima run the world til my clock stops homey

Time x3

Chronomentrophobia—the fear of time
I'm Francis Ford Coppola
The writer of Apocalypse Now is upon us
I guess time is the opponent
With Armageddon approaching, I'm strivin' to be the dopest
Instead of gettin' prepared, I'm focused on hypnosis
With the flow, yeah—I know how close it is
I'd rather match wit with Soul about who the coldest is
And carry on like I don't notice it
Sprinkle jewels here and there while committin' the grossest sins
Infinite living just isn't consistent with our comprehension
Everything we know has an ending
Analyze time, it means limits, I never knew them
I'm throwing shots back, the world spinning
4026 before our common era man was made
In 2012 we live in terror
Cause time is of the essence
We ain't got time for no comments or no suggestions
But just begging my pardon, enjoying my party
Cause Ima keep spinning until the world stop homey
Yeah, said Ima keep spinning until the world stop homey
Cause time is of the essence
I hope my intellect is manifested

Almost There,Longterm Mentality,2011,"I know exactly how it is to feel like no one cares
About the hard work you put in but who said life was fair?
It sure wasn't me I take the bitter with the sweet
And boil it in the pot make a hot toddy
I said If I'm going to play I'm going to play for keeps
Raise stakes, take stage, speak my peace
Make my pay, take my lady on a date
Send my parents on a cruise
Living, somewhere with a killer view, oh the irony I spew
But for now the studio couches gonna have to do
I ain't going to take what I ain't earned myself, foolish pride
That's what you need to survive, it's do or die
So step aside I don't mean no trouble
Just want to be someone that CJ could look up to
Oh, and just so you know
When I'm on the road I'm at the Travelodge not The W

Almost there, almost there, almost there
The finish line is in sight but I'm almost there, almost there, almost there
Almost there, almost there, almost there
Even if the sun don't shine the sun don't shine, almost

Somebody asked me, what you mean by longterm mentality, actually?
So I had to break it down:
Don't get caught up in the now, focus on the years abroad
Cause today you're here but tommorow you could be gone
Singing the same old song
And who's the place to blame on? Other than you
Whatever it is you do
From slanging eight balls to graduating from school
Just gotta see it all before it happens
I ain't saying see a psychic
I'm just saying have a, idea of what you're accomplishing
You'll have a greater chance to accomplish it
You know a little strategy, premeditation
Wins races nine times out of ten
As if losing's ever an option
Had to bust my own bubble I really thought I was popping
(Not quite)

Almost there, almost there, almost there
The finish line is in sight but I'm almost there, almost there, almost there
Almost there, almost there, almost there
Even if the sun don't shine the sun don't shine, almost

Just know your future's right around the corner
Oppurtunity galore for ya
More and more you'll start to see it's no limit to what you can be
In any event, eventually
Treat your first like your last time
Cause it might be your last time, that's what I learned last time
Look forward to looking forward in my pastime
You just letting time pass like ""that's fine"" as wine
Contrary to popular belief, I want the peace
They say I'm headed hellbound at God's speed
Gesundheit, or bless me if you like
As I, put my faith in this bud and budlight
I've been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
Talk my shit, drop my load on

Wish I could put the B.S. behind me
And yes, I've been fresh, you need sterilizing
And yes, I've been left, and you ain't invited
Every time I'm arriving everybody excited
Just witness the glitz and the glam of shining
Let me get it back from the top Ali

Life
I wonder will it take me underground like a runaway slave
Where the hip hop radio don't play, what more can I say
I need to get away from the lights
Flashing in my face like a topless model
And the topless bottles keep popping like a Glock
And it's coming non-stop, take a shot - don't worry about the price
Everything is paid for, you fully accommodated
When you bumping shoulders with the Grammy nominated
Making American Pie, get you a slice
It's the American Dream, right?
So it seems I need to air out my self-esteem
It's so high

But I
Wish I could put the B.S. behind me
And yes, I've been fresh, you need sterilizing
And yes, I've been left, and you ain't invited

Just witness the glitz and the glam of shining
Can't tell who real or who lyin'
I may just, go on a hiatus

Almost lost my life to the industry
Better yet I did, I should bury me
And I ain't even sell one record yet
And she can see I'm hanging on barely
And my bitch say I'm arrogant
Cause when she with me I feel she should cherish it
Only cause you never know when I'mma perish
Not the clothing line but if the shit fit I wear it
Stick to the script I will - Ferris
Nobody ever said it'll be fair so
When the tabloids read ""Death To Ab-Soul""
I couldn't get up, said I'll keep it on the down low
You never know what's next, or know what to expect
Still mourning for armor, but now I'm a prospect
From dusk until dawn, I feel like a object
Under a telescope

But I
Wish I could put the B.S. behind me
And yes, I've been fresh, you need sterilizing
And yes, I've been left, and you ain't invited
Every time I'm arriving everybody excited
Just witness the glitz and the glam of shining
Can't tell who real or who lyin'
I may just, go on a hiatus

I loosen my tie
So I can drown in my drink
I loosen my tie
And give myself some space to breathe
I see the skyline
And the clouds are so at peace
I need some my time (my time my time)

I need a Mai Tai
So I can drown in my drink
I loosen my tie
And give myself some space to breathe

And the clouds are so at peace
I need some my time (my time my time)

Yes, you were designed to fail
No, you will never attain everything

Look at your ignorant ways
Look at your innocent eyes

Don’t take responsibility for your actions anyway
In any way, shape, form, or fashion
Dont be rational for goodness sake, a-dapt
There's no need to stand up, act like you got bad back
Spasms that you can't take
You are not invincible, imbecile you can break

Who you ain't
Where you going, where you been

Plant a seed, teach, he or she to be the, deity

 make a way for today
Tomorrow was yesterday
Find a fine line between time and space
Contact the cosmos and you'll hear 'em say

Just believe

And please don't confuse me with dot, I'm different
Long Term Mentality, still remember them cheap wood benches
How could I ever forget, I never could get
How niggas couldn't get up and get all they could get
Man I done seen a thing or two of things that he or she will do
To fit in with each other nitpicking at each other
Killing each other, bringing each other down, crustations in a bucket
Fuck it, roll your windows down in your bucket, play this loud
Soul brother number fucking two, my time on these 1's and 2's
I'm on this track like running shoes
I dedicate this one to Cletus Anderson for working harder
Than the average man, or bend over backwards for his family
Doing whatever is you ask for him
Shit, I know he fucking tired, he should be somewhere retired
Still trying, bills still due and between me and you
Until we get a mill, life smells like mildew

Long term (I hope you studied, cause I'm thinking long term)

Long term (Mother fucker this is long term)
Mentality, mentality, long term

This situation is to relay how to make other people's lives

Better because of running into what you have to say (Exactly)
Of them finding your words
And they need to know this I've been doing this since
??? freestyle track
That's probably like, what? 2002-3? Know what I'm saying?
And I kept at it, I kept at it from there
(And you're only) 24
I just turned 24, I just turned 24 it's crazy, know what I'm saying?
So I dropped the -- you know, long term came out
I dropped that finally
Then I came back with the long term 2 shit they was like ""oh!""
That's kinda cool, that's kinda cool right there
Then dot dropped the O.D. Kendrick dropped the O.D
That shit was like (It went over everyone's head)
Everyone's head (But they were still able to connect with it)
Exactly (But it was like you hadn't heard this in a minute)
It was like a rejuvenation (Exactly, exactly)
Almost like, saved hip-hop
And without preaching, none of y'all are trying to preach like
You're the new cats but it's just -- you're not --
You didn't ever look at it like it was dead but you're bringing it Back (Exactly)
You're bringing it back to life (Real shit)
Then Q dropped the Setback shit and that shit was like
You know what I'm saying? You know -- you already know
Groovin'
So Top -- Top talk to me like you know...
You gotta go ahead and try sell something
I'm thinking to myself it's a little too early for me to try and sell
I'm still fresh but he said you need to go and try it out
Everybody else selling
I gotta do long term something nigga I don't care what it is
But that's your brain, long term is your brain
I didn't want to do long term 3 yet until I'm rich
That's what long term 3 is about, being rich
So -- I'm like you know (Damn, okay)
So this is kinda, you know, just kinda like a -- I wanted it to serve

I mean fuck I'm on tour now dog
I'm in Minneapolis, dog (People know you)
You know what I'm talking 'bout?
I'm in Minneapolis bruh, cold as fuck people know who I am over
Here bruh
I'm on tour with murderers right now, paid dudes too
Like what the fuck is going on? (That's long term!)
You are the paid dude, he just said it by putting you on it
(Soul!)

People talk about a soul
To me what we call soul -- the highest expression of ourselves
Is pure love
I don't care who you are, what your background is what you've Done
I don't care if you're Henry Kissinger or George Bush
Or David Rockefeller or the Queen of England or any of these
Guys that have been manipulating the world and still are
At that level of yourself, you're pure love
Everyone is but you can become disconnected from that level
And manifest in that disconnection anything but pure love
But that's what we all are, all of us",https://genius.com/Ab-soul-ltm-lyrics

If you ain't got a dollar to your name, can you maintain?
Are you lost, are all your thoughts on the same train?
I been riding it out, despite the amount
I've yet to acquire in my checking account
They checking me out, they peeping my game
I paid my dues, I even kept my receipt and my change
My life is like a movie if Siskel hate it then sue me
Fuck a Maybach, I'm straight in the back of this hooptie
It started out a hobby, became my life
Left my emotions, lonesome, hence the pain I write
Some call it therapy, some call it rap music
I call it hip-hop, no, no, no trap music
You never seen me heat the pot to whip the rock
You never seen me creeping down your block with the Glock
You never seen no diamonds in my chain or in my watch
You never seen me in a G5 or on a yacht but picture that

Picture this, picture being poor, picture being rich
Picture having more, picture not having shit
Picture that, what a sight to see, picture you, picture me
Picture us, picture we, together at the top, where we should be

Speaking of being at the top, champagne, bottoms up
I take that back, cause matter of fact, this E and J, dollar shot
Is hitting the spot like a rave my real niggas give me props
Cause I ain't afraid to say what I am and what I am not
You had her not, I had like seven dollars knowin I'mma drop
Five on that session as soon as A-chizzle hit the block
Chocolate Swisher burn slow though I hope it never stop
So I can get high forever and accomplish my endeavors
Niggas pulling up in Benzes, telling me that I'm the one
I'm guessing when my clock climaxes then my time'll come
I never shot a gun but I be killing all y'all raps
Cause all y'all wack, I be jogging on all y'all tracks
I mean so many lines that, I could call you all back, yeah
I could send you all a fax, with all facts
Budget tighter than my bitch's all black bra strap
Grab a digital camera and picture that

Picture that picture this, picture being poor, picture being rich
Picture having more, picture not having shit
Picture that, what a sight to see, picture you, picture me

In the presence of my gifted ass, incredible gift of gab
Don't have a cent to spare but pull up a chair, I'll take you back
To where my Christmases was full of gifts, I surely had
Left Santa milk and cookies, we miss you Bernie Mac
Left him a letter and what do you know, he even wrote my back
I don't remember what it said but the point is that
Soon as I had to take the role for my own acts
It seemed as though, all my presents started gradually
Turning into coal, I graduated with a car
Four years later that mothafucka's stuck in park
I missed the days we cut through the alley to the Del Amo park
Or further than that, Nick at Nite, are you Afraid of the Dark?
I keep these memories on my mind cause they define me
Like Dictionary.com, bliss kisses ignorance
Pay them unless your intelligent and her pussy be wet as shit
You would come in a flash, please hold the flash, but picture that

Picture that picture this, picture being poor, picture being rich
Picture having more, picture not having shit

I'm chasing the wind and I don't know if I'm losing or winning
Damn shame, shit, I ain't complaining
It's no limits nigga, it's only entertainment
So I'm in the Bugatti and got the burner too
Right place, right time, I'll murder you
Huh, I finally did it, what's the use in being witty ain't nobody with it
I'd rather sticky my woody in a wonder woman
So good I might never want another one
But I'mma always want another woman, real nigga to the core my dude
Straight from the liquor store from getting more sippy from me
And my recipients 'til we stumble to the floor my dude
Straight off top, T.D.E. till 3003
No scratch that, I can't calculate that exact
My downfall will probably never be an incident though
Use your mind, don't just listen to the instrumental
Read the signs before you end up in a pile of shit
You probably did, the least you can do is crack a window
You smell that? And if I catch him taking a nap, I tell him that...

I hope it hit you like a bus done run up ito ya
I'm only fucking with ya, I know it's nothing to ya
What I gotta make is something to ya
Slept on us long enough, you got it coming to ya

See me I'm from the mid, don't fuck with the kid
Heavy artillery, this long will split your wig
Put your fitted on the curb, you know, rip your lid
Brains on the sidewalks you know what it is, that is
I got that strict mentality
Razorblade in my mouth, bitch wanna battle me
Huh? I slice this bitch up, I ain't playing
Snare need stitches from the words that I'm saying
Name my badem, Repping L.A.'n
Tattoo's showing, mean muggin' at the way in
Smack you with a bottle that I picked up on the way in
And them niggas that rolling with you only with you cause you pay 'em
And real niggas don't get extorted
We call for the mother ship, then we board it
That mean we fly how we wanna fly
Me and Ab coming for you, better go run and hide, bitch

What I gotta make is something to ya
Slept on us long enough, you got it coming to ya

Look, I'm really sick, you need to quit, like quiet without the E
Supplying the D-man's, sometimes it gets deep man
You will die in the deep end, surviving to see it
And I'mma be here, the bible is re-writ
HiiiPower, you can yell it
But make sure it's three i's when you spell it
I'm at the bottom of the barrel, let them niggas tell it
I might have to put the barrel to a niggas melon
Pull up on a few hoes in the new McLaren
Back to the condo, condom broke, now I'm apparent

Babylon, Babylon, out my window all I see is Babylon
On the news, all I see is Babylon
And all niggas do is just babble on
Money and hoes, want money and hoes
If I sold dope, I'd have plenty of flows
If I was from the projects like Jay Rock
I would've more than likely slang rocks
All my life I done been around Crips and Bloods
Pimps and thugs, just to name a few
I do drugs, Momma say it's in my blood
But she don't know what the fuck I've been through
To creep through the back door
The typical black boy in the good old USA
Before I pushed rhymes like weight
I used to wanna play for the NBA (Hey…)
Fuck I'm doin' talkin' about pineal gland?
Ancient ways of Sumerians?
Ain't nothin' wrong with a righteous man (Damn…)

For my niggas on the corner, sellin' water

And I just love it, I hope it don't stop
I don't give a damn, nigga, bang that block!
I don't give a fuck, nigga, bang that Glock!
I seen an image of Hitler in the picture
When the Twin Towers dropped
Peep the concept
You've got progress, you've got congress
We protest in hopes they confess
Just proceed on your conquest

I told myself I was gon' win

But it was gon' end up happenin', I want in
So you can take your top 5 list
Dead or alive, and put me after Em
I'm a fuckin' genius
Grippin' my fuckin' penis, livin' this life
You can't tell me nothin'
Still ain't really got no money, fuckin' right
I'm all about that real, about that real
This ain't no motion picture
I tell you how that feel, how that feel
Even when the odds against you
They wanna see me wearin' Polo drawers
Put two chains on, and that ain't wrong
But that ain't me, I go too damn hard
I don't need clothes or jewelry to stand out
Black lip nigga with his hair wild, too damn proud
Been killin' this since Cam made ""Oh Boy""
Oh boy, I'm the man now
TDE, put the money in my hand, ain't shit free
This business is quick sand and I won't sink
Put the pistol in my hand and I won't think
Blat, blat, blat! Rest in peace
You just made room for the next to be
I never been afraid to say what I wanna say
When I wanna say it, okay then
Furthermore, we do this for y'all
Rap is stressin', but it pays great
That is, until you lose appeal
And your release date get date raped
Stay safe, hold your head

Now I feel I could run laps 'round Jay Z
Nas ain't seen nothin' this nasty
BIG and Pac got it comin' when I pass, too
You got the mic? I ain't the one you wanna pass to
My niggas say my new shit past due
I paid dues, even got that shit tattooed
HiiiPower on another plateau
I know you know we need a few plaques too
The brand new niggas with a attitude
Poppin' in Compton or Timbuktu
I might even sell my new shit for ten bucks too
Too ill when I jot these words, true eel when I shock the world
I know life's a bitch
When you know life's a bitch, then that's not your girl
Cold shit, I'm hot though, like coal get, Ab-Soul
This is a shift in paradigm
I remember when I couldn't spare a dime
Now I step in with a pair of dimes, on P's, y'all know me
Flow like water, admiralty, the best author ever to breathe
And as we proceed to follow these dreams, I ain't losin' no sleep
No-no on them NoDoz, just know ""no"" if it's no dough
So high, but I'm Soulo, two cups and I sip slow
Takin' my time, we don't just shine, we illuminate the whole show

Time and time, I drop line for line but only time will tell
If I ever go Columbine and cop thirty 9s and cock back and kill
See, the truth is they wanna know
How close me, Dre, and Snoop is
Or how the shoe fits when they choose this
To beat 2Pac, but truth, I give two shits
'Bout expectations or critics hatin'
Shit, I just put Moms on vacation
Bitch, you never know my new location, it's across nations
Court cases get thrown out
So tell the mothafuckin' king dethrone now
I am ruler, I am highness, the Prince Zamunda
I am the shit like what the prune does
Black on black tint like Kinte Kunta
Black is back, bitch, I'm kin to Kunta
Black-on-black crime resent the shooter
Blat, blat, blat! I intend to mute ya
Racks on racks, I don't rap on tracks
Without my A-game, so please don't ask me about no pressure
Bitch, with the grip of my fingertip I can hold this coast together

They wanna share my light, they wanna share my light

Diamond in the rough, tell Brock I need a pack of Woods
Two white cups full of codeine
Plus I got two white sluts down to blow me
Can't you see I'm floating like root beer and ice cream?
My synapses act like lightning
Probably why I'm so enlightenin'
Probably why these niggas can't fuck with me
I'm lookin' like, ""Who the fuck invited them?""
They failed in testin', like what's inside of them
Soulo, Soulo – say it like you mean it

I'm gettin' meaner by the minute
Its mine, I spend it; my mind is spinnin'
Your time is tickin', the sky's the limit
We in a space where matter don't matter
Just spirit molecules and geometric patterns
Shitted in a crater last time I sat on Saturn
Got a letter from Andromeda, they tryna shrine my bladder

Enjoy your mind trip, but don't trip on your mind
No man is safe from the war goin' on outside
That's right, you ever been conscious in a coma?
Please don't tell my momma, this ain't marijuana
I might be trippin' off that DMT

I made my dreams reality, so to speak

I'm in a whole nother realm, go to hell
Last nigga tried to scratch the surface broke a nail
Last nigga tried to cross the line got crucified
We overseas, back-to-back, never wore Chanel
The new nucleus never sittin' in a cell
Genius idiot, best description of myself
I'm in a fuckin' lab coat, rhymin' as high as shit
When I die, donate my organs to science, bitch!

The Book of Soul,Control System ,2012,"Saucy

Your momma told me, ""Read the Book of Job""
They should've called it the Book of Soul
I came into this hurtful Earth in perfect health
Caught Stevens-Johnson syndrome when I was 10 years old
Internal and external fever, 80%...
Fatality rate at that time, ain't that some shit?
Severe pinkeye, my eyes swollen shut
For like two or three months, it's still bright as fuck
Oh, and I even lost my lip skin
Grew back darker than its original pigment
Skin disfigured from boils and blisters
Unidentifiable by my little sister
Come to think of it, I could've got a crazy check
The shrink thought I'd be traumatized, but I'ma ride
My first years of Junior High School were not alright
Them dimes wouldn't give me no time, no, not a nod
I mean not even you, we eventually got cool
But I was nobody, you was the hottest hottie in the school
Or the world to me, not saying that 'cause I'm your dude
I'm glad I got to watch the woman that you blossomed to
Ironic, we always had the same classes
I copied off your work
And you ain't always have the right answers
But it worked, mama, thanks a lot
Probably wouldn't have even graduated had you not
Somewhere down the line, we became an item
The love was in the air like this flight I'm lighting
The first few years were so exciting
Got deeper in this rap and started pushing shit back
My money got funny, you wanted to go on dates
I had a Sounwave beat tape tryna beat Drake
Could've spent every minute with you, but I had to get it
For me and you, you sing too, so you knew the business
I know it was hard, but you stayed down
My fam had doubts, you told me you was proud
I did some things, you did some things, always came back together
We knew the only way to make it work is work together
Seven whole years, seven whole years
It was supposed to end with our grandkids
Luckily for me, I'm used to being cut short
I'm such a nice guy, why, Lord?
Why Lori? Why you had to take her from me?
Guess He needed your angel face for all of Heaven to see
Your picture's still on my mirror, and it's so scary
I swear I still ain't looked at your obituary
So now, I'm so doped up, I think I'm flying
I hope this spliff'll never finish
I guess the Mayans wasn't lying
2012, my world ended
You used to say that I could see the future
You was wrong, 'cause you was in it
And I was just with you the day before
You said you loved me, I said I loved you more
And as much I wanna cower, bid the mic adieu
And fall off a fucking tower tryna find you
I gotta stay 'cause I remember that day
I looked you in the face and told you:
""Nothing can stop me, not even you""
Stick to the plan, I'll meet you at our spot
If reincarnation is true and we don't get too lost
Even if you forget me and everything you left behind
I never lied, I love you in a place where there's no space and time
I close my eyes, and I can still hear you singing loud
We never got to tell them who The Love Religion was about
I ain't finna stage a cry in this rhyme
Signed, sincerely yours, I live to let you...

My momma and music is next
And if that happens before I turn 28
Then I'm going out with Kurt Cobain
I still believe in God, we just ain't never spoke
Unless we talkin' symbolically—then, I might agree
But if you really wanna look at it that way
Then, ayy, man, God don't like me
I refuse to believe that
But what's acceptable is anything's possible, but nobody's special
My ma took my TV, Clem took my radio
Now, I'm on TV and on the radio

Now, having said that, I'll go back to this document. This was a meeting, okay this was what he said:
“Very soon, every American will be required to register their biological property in a national system designed to keep track of the people and that will operate under the ancient system of pledging. By such methodology, we can compel people to submit to our agenda, which will effect our security as a chargeback for our fiat paper currency. Every American will be forced to register, or suffer being unable to work and earn a living. They will be our chattel, and we will hold the security interest over them forever, by operation of the law merchant under the scheme of secured transactions.
Americans, by unknowingly or unwittingly delivering the bills of lading to us will be rendered bankrupt and insolvent, forever to remain economic slaves through taxation, secured by their pledges. They will be stripped of their rights and given a commercial value designed to make us a profit and they will be none the wiser, for not one man in a million could ever figure our plans and, if by accident one or two should figure it out, we have in our arsenal plausible deniability. After all, this is the only logical way to fund government, by floating liens and debt to the registrants in the form of benefits and privileges. This will inevitably reap to us huge profits beyond our wildest expectations and leave every American a contributor to this fraud which we will call 'Social Insurance.' Without realizing it, every American will insure us for any loss we may incur and in this manner, every American will unknowingly be our servant, however begrudgingly. The people will become helpless and without any hope for their redemption, and we will employ the high office of the President of our dummy corporation to foment this plot against America.”",https://genius.com/Ab-soul-bohemian-grove-lyrics

And they couldn't wait for Soul to reappear
Click, boom; TNT, TDE, we in here
Mm, mm, mm! I can smell fear
From a mile away, you might as well get from 'round here
I run the town like Roc Nation, no exaggeration
Bet I rise like Lazarus, use your imagination
Fascinated by you faggots hatin', get an occupation
You in violation, provoke annihilation
Flow like the Nile River, yo, it's now or never
You had a release date, but now it's never
Yeah, welcome to the Control System
I'm stimulatin' the hoes and educatin' my niggas
I wiggle through potholes, my destination is vivid
To the end of the road I'm driven, y'all trippin'… Soulo

And we stuntin' like, Ab-Soul, abstract, asshole

Same Chucks, two years straight, doin' bad shit
Sick, twist two spliffs out my dime bag shit
Pissed, tryna get a good response out this bad bitch
Which one of you niggas wanna call my bluff?
Wish granted, call his ass granite, now he mopped up
Never been locked up, but I keep a sentence
Winners win and sinners sin only to ask God forgiveness
In this world of luxury cars and legal tender
Johnny want me like Wyclef Jean: gone til' November
Pop my collar like I'm Don Juan, green to my slippers
Just remember that they don't want me to get ignorant
Sinister literature, given from this wicked minister
Witness your future diminish, no present from Saint Nicholas
In particular, you're just a thing of the past
I'm a diamond ring in the trash, no reason to brag, it's Ab

The View, The Village, Scottsdale and right back around
Can't forget about The Patch, matter fact
I got some homies off Grace Ave, we go way back
Been runnin' round since L train cut up at Our People
Rocket was my role model, Lil Roccett my number one O-migo
Went 15 in the back alley, hop fences and skip school
Fellowship with the gang members, and goddamn it, I still do
But just imagine if Einstein got high and sipped juice
Broke rules, got pussy, beat up rookies on Pro Tools

She dancing Secret Sundays and I'm 'bout to prey

She got that magical vaginal, let me hocus poke
Row, row, row my boat gently down your stream
She into Alexander McQueen but she ain't met the king

TDE we got the belt, hold it down if nothing else
And this is my new single, cut the cheese it's bout to melt
Lean in my cup, pinky up like Dr. Evil (zip it)

ScHoolboy Q, OG, and dirty pineapple Fanta

He with the homies, he with the homies
No squares in his circle, nobody phony
He with the homies, he with the homies

He got a main chick, been with her for a while
Love making, and making out
His fellas' in his ear, ""You acting like a queer
You going on dates, we tryna get this cake!""
When the pressure gets to setting in
""If you a real man, you would fuck her friend""
Head saying no, other one saying yes
His girl girlfriend been with it, it's scandalous
Unfasten her clothes, she swore she won't tell a soul
The thrill of it all got him off, case closed
He hesitated, and she say ""Why you push me?
If you don’t get this pussy, then you a pussy, nigga""

Tired of living, living, living
By this double standard, standard, standard
Tired of living, living, living
By this double standard, standard, standard

She with the girls, she with the girls
Hair done, nails done, no care in the world
She with the girls, she with the girls
They all wifey material, yes sir
She want a boyfriend, she been missing out
On love making and making out
But she ain't having the best luck
Everybody who chop it up only want a cut
One of her girlfriends got one
She been jealous of the relationship since day one
But last week he made a pass at her
She knew she had him, her ass a little fatter
Unbuttoned his jeans and then she fell to her knees
She finally found company for her misery
He hesitated, and she say ""Why you push me?
If you don't get this pussy, then you a pussy, nigga""

Tired of living, living, living
By this double standard, standard, standard
Tired of living, living, living

See, the moral of the story is:
She a ho, he a pimp
Old girl will forgive her man
But her girlfriends cut off like Edward's hands
What's fucked up is he got at her
Bitches call her a rat, but shit, she's heard worse
To my niggas having bitches, it's what you just do
To the bitches having niggas, it's what a slut do
My auntie told me always treat my lady right
My uncle told me only love 'em for a night
You can see the immediate disconnection
Between a man and a woman, the reason for regression
For example, you heard of Amber Cole
But you don't know that nigga that was getting dome
I'm saying we heard of Amber Cole
But we don't know that lil' nigga that was getting dome

I ain't afraid to die, more afraid of myself
Niggas lookin' at me like I don't hear myself
Like I don't know pain, I been here myself
This life will drive you crazy – only if you let it
I'm just an American expressin', give me some credit
Won't be surprised if before I rise I'm beheaded
These are the days of our lives
Nightmares of a thief comin', takin' my life
I go to sleep thinkin' I may never wake up
In this reality at least I keep my bed made up
I just wish they all could see what I can see
If we could stop it with the violence
And apply a lil' logic, I believe
We could thrive to be a promising civilization
We may die individually, but as a nation
We'll rise, nigga, change lives, nigga
Break ties from the everyday lies, nigga
It's not time until it's our time

Don't be so afraid to die
Until it's our time
Don't be so afraid to die
It's our time, 'til it's our time
‘Cause we'll never die

All I see is confusion and chaos
Blatant disorder, authorities pickin' on the minorities
Unfortunately, the land of the free has little to offer me
And got me often thinkin' about offing me
I wake up in the morning and I ask myself
Is life worth livin'? Should I blast myself?
I'm tired of bein' broke, and even worse
The upper class act like they don't want me on this earth
This life will drive you crazy – only if you allow it
That's only if you a coward, and you're sure to get devoured
To no avail, tuck your tail, and all you do is give them power
Who's gonna take a stand? Who's gonna be a man?
Who do you work for? Please help me understand!
You could be the victor in this situation
We may die individually, but as a nation
We'll rise, nigga, change lives, nigga
Break ties from the everyday lies, nigga
It's our time, until it's our time

Don't be so afraid to die
Until it's our time
Don't be so afraid to die
It's our time, 'til it's our time

Pardon my immortality
I'm Martin Luther shootin' back on the balcony
Escapin' the Lorraine until they call in the cavalry
Alpha 184, oh Lord, nobody blast for me
If it takes me to be a martyr to push the envelope farther
Nigga, show me to the slaughter
I gladly sacrifice what is percieved
Sow my seed, so my seed can live its dreams
My spittin' image, see my stitchin' in his genes
Accordin' to my likeness, his breath of life is priceless
My enlightenment's the ancient Chaldeans
Penetratin' America's culture to its very being
It's not political, it's more critical
Spiritual warfare, you can murder me in the physical
But I advise y'all to keep me alive
In the event of my demise, I'll be bigger than life
Beautiful death, nigga!

Tragedy after tragedy, I know it's sad to see
America killin' her babies like Casey Anthony
We try, we try to cope and hold on to our sanity
Poppin' ecstasy will surely shorten life expectancy
We travel the seven seas in hopes for a little peace
We promised pie in the sky, I'm dyin' to get a piece

It’ll be like a thief in the night, make sure your people's alright
That’s right, the writing's on the wall
They was only worried about Sodom ‘cause they ain’t have the balls to go against the gods
The only brown dwarf swaggin’
Cross yo sun just like a dragon
The Japanese know what’s happening
They was debating ‘bout Kobe and LeBron
The Bible or the Qur’an, they should’ve been taking cover
They said I’m red but gold is my favorite color
Witnesses agreed, they see me with wings when I hover
Might even make your pole shift when I’m skipping through
My orbit is a bitch on her menstrual
They underminded the prophecy of Daniel
That’s a bummer, now I’m at your doorstep but not for sugar
This that anunnaki flow, Enki and Enlil would love it
Serious as the war in Syria, bitch

Fuck I’m doing talking ‘bout pineal glands
Fuck I’m doing talking ‘bout pineal glands
Ancient ways of Sumerians
Ain’t nothing wrong with a righteous man
Uh, this is my Anunnaki flow
Oh, this be my Anunnaki flow
Yo, I got that Anunnaki flow
You are now on Planet X, I’m the God, show your respect

In case one of my niggas go to jail, I can bail em out
I heard that Lucifer's the angel of music
This is preposterous, so much for Gospel we all stupid
Look, toast to the gods, Del Amo Boulevard
That's where I was, pacing back and forth like I was on drugs
And I was, but I was comin' up with some raw shit
It was either this or hittin' licks with whats-her-name and them
They had that work, turns out I'm sellin' crinack anyway

I just left Burberry and dropped five, like I went half on a dime
But not this time, Soul-o
And I don't find it odd, I'm breakin' even
Maybe I should've prayed to Jesus instead of Herbert Stevens
I'd rather murder beats than murder people, for this reason

Rapper Shit,UnKnown,2012,"My back against the wall, like I see y'all fronting
Drowning in your own spit and ain't coming up with nothing
I call this shit ""Rapper Shit"" cause I ain't a rapper
But if I was, this ain't some shit that I could rap after
Caught up in the rapture, you call yourself a factor
You're lame, paving a way Bob could build faster
I'm a real master, real massive, you just real average
I see your chain, it's strange, they wore those in the Middle Passage
And it's harder to play me than to fiddle backwards
Don't act like you knew my tactics
Cause when it hits the fan, you know I stand last
I see through your true colors like stained glass
I see the fear in your eyes when we arrive
And what's the odds of even thinking you coincide
When every time a nigga open a door you go inside
Just to realize, either you're weak or someone lied
See, you spend more time boasting about what you do than you do
So by the time your shit is due it's doo-doo
And who knew that too cool fool who used to sit in the back
Would slip through the crack, like dudes who went to rehab
Ab-Soul, Abstract Asshole
Black Lip Bastard, et cetera for forever
I follow no ruler, even if I'm under a drastic measure
But whatever

They say pressure bust pipes
And I ain't never had to deal with plumbing in my life, now that's a bar
Sparring with me like blasphemy to cathedral
Or colliding with the diesel with your baby in your arms
You would test me but you know better
It's inadequate to go against the Jesus of Nazareth
Of the rap game, and guess what, I got no cheddar
But my mind is like a wizard
I defy the laws of gravity every time I get high and write a sentence
Back teeth never been in agony, but I got wisdom
I have risen from the wicked to jump on the competition, Scorch ya, third degree burns next to their sideburns,
All sorts of combustible flows, firemen on speed dial
Free the leaders of the free world with a freestyle
Free the teachers, black activists get up off your feet now
And feed off my feelings
As I control my wheel like new power steering, so sincere
Tryna duck court hearings but I got big ears
Rap peers, used to study them wishing they would fuck with me
Now they can't fuck with him, I'm wishing good luck to them
Reluctantly these critics loving me and I don't blame 'em
They say, Kendrick you gunning for these niggas
So when I pull my weapon out, I give 'em the pleasure to see me aim it
And watch these bullets run into these niggas, clear the set
I got now, I got next, give you nouns, give you verbs
Give you adjectives while proposing an agitated threat
I am most debated in barber shops all because they slept on me
Big homie fear young, buck cause when I buck I make more than a buck
Dollars come quick like a fucking nun fucking for the first time
Put me in Alaska for six months in the dark, in my heart I know sun still shine
Still got a skill to be found in a gold mine

I got an appetite for habitual liars on the mic
Who with pliers couldn't get a grip on life
I spit like I sat the tip of my dick on ice, and that's intense
Imagine if I had already came twice, ain't that some shit
Pass the swisher nigga, fill your cup with liquor nigga
Fly your kite till you're gone till November nigga
Show 'em you remember nigga
Pour some Hennessy and Crown for your homie six feet underground
Smoke an ounce and turn that frown upside down
Like the triangle in the panties of my gal
When Mike Jack made ""Raining in Moscow"" I had no style
Tommy Boy stocking on my scalp
And that was like ninety-five, now it's twenty-ten
Two years away from when they say the world's expected to end
And I ain't even begin
That's more ironic than a bum asking for 50 Cent from ""Many Men""
, one

Too many relays for DJs to replay
I do the reject while I eject your new singlay
Hot enough to sit in hell, then unveil in heatwave
Piss on a demon with ice water
And if I lose my voice then I'm probably calling out to all P.A
Systems to assist in with the word I'm tryna spread
Like county jail bread or the legs of a hoochie
And that's off top like a toupee, 
I'm 2Pac
Coming back for doomsday, spitting at cops,
 go and cop my album
Get high to it, pop some valium, then turn up the volume
I influence ghettos where it says caution
And them bloggers get to sparking like L.A. females that's balling
Round the time this happens often, the violence get the flare
We racing against life, the turtle or the hare?
And nobody can compare to the legacy that we bout to build
Y'all work at Build-A-Bear soft as underhand pitching with skills

Shit, and ain't no use in crying over spilt milk
You're dead and gone
The pall-bearers carry you and your family will carry on
And on the real, this ain't a construction site but you know the drill
We lead the league in all aspects
And we deserve more medals than a magnet
Put you niggas in a hole like bad debt
Shooting three pointers with the globe, nothing but nets

Nigga, nothing but the best
Every time we hit your tape deck niggas hit the deck
I rhyme like a fucking TEC-9,
And I 'Clown Posses' if they disrespect
You looking at a T-Rex snapping at 'em with Tourette's
Yeah, this the flow that killed aspiring rappers
Too late, I grab the eight and start expiring rappers
Some shit only BIG and Pac could rap after
And if they was alive, they would have to pay tithes
I am God
M.C.R. squares will disperse in despair, this is me motherfucker",https://genius.com/Ab-soul-rapper-shit-lyrics

Eating rappers on a plate like etouffée

'Nahm saying?' was a classic, I wish you could have heard it
I be fucking over beats til I damage the cervix
I got bars like night clubs, and great service
5:30 in the morning, I'm still up cooking

So I'mma party to the end, can i finish, counting ends

She don't smoke, but she roll my dope

Yo, check, my flow is unknown to man yet
Dammit, keep running around like an annual banquet
Made a withdrawal with your broad, she left the bank wet
Rub her like a condom contemplating dangerous sex
I'm unimpressed with your talent, skill still appeal
A maestro on the mic though, I'm almost ill as Camille for real
Ain't never runnin' from nothin', I'm fit to tread mills
Name another movement makin' time stand still
Hiiipower to the third degree
Murder, we emerged and it was an emergency
It's closed curtains for you worthless earthlings
Hurtin' cause I rise like mercury in the burning heat
Word on the street Soulo done done it again
Look at me, I used to match a dub sack with my friends
Now we smokin' by the O, like the letters P and N
Ain't have to start watching CNN for you to see an end
It's coming quicker than you think, don't mean to rub it in
Like lubriderm, but you should learn that you could never fuck with him
Ab's gettin' bigger, but I ain't do no sit-ups
Got the hiccups cause I keep puffin' Ports without the filter
Feel the vibe switch in every single room that I enter
Told my bitch to make room for a tomb for her placenta, nigga
I fuck her 'til she have a seizure in my leisure time
She know I love her, also know I don't need her
Cause I'm a king and I smoke a lot of weed
That makes sense, it's about 33 ounces in a liter
In layman's terms you lames had better pay respect
Or you'll be sleepin', they'll be at your wake payin' their respects

Said it's the soul cold wickedness
Old folk killin' shit
Most dope syndicate, the GoPros filmin' it
Good coke sniffin' shit, broke no benefits
Smack him in his face and then I'm blowin' smoke into it
Obliterated on a big estate
Shit, I figure fame is just a bitches game
That's why there's raindrops drippin' off my windowpane
And I was gettin' money far before the Fisker came
Official name's got plugs like a new strain does
You may be hot inside your city, homie you ain't us
You can't trust nothin' if it's comin' with a dollar sign
It's genius comin' from out of my awkward mind
Cross the line, it's just not the time
And he ain't thinkin', put that red dot on his mind
I'm Santana's bandana, against me you don't stand a chance
Call you fancy pants cause when you're drunk you do the hammer dance
If there's a random chance you're fuckin' up my Phantom plans
I'mma go bananas and blam 'em into the ambulance
My mother's sonogram was like a mission statement
Cause I wasn't patient, left that pussy in a spaceship
Y'all fools basic, your parents both racist
I'm lawyering these hoes out here, beatin' cases
She eatin' dick so she plead the fifth
Yeah, it's Larry Fish, homie he's a myth
You sunk my battleship, I'll be in Nazareth by where Jesus live
And your homie with you, he's a bitch, some vagina shit
Gettin' faded, go and sin in Vegas
I'm just observant, man of different faces
Some dick-licker want my kids in her
She a switch-hitter, told her bring her bitch with her
The dick split her like a swisher then I'm outty, outty
Never eat the pussy if it's lousy, it's lousy
I'm the prodigal son
With ominous, Nostradamus anonymous visions
Confidence, some Obama shit, in Mocassins they can
In moccasins they can ante, alright",https://genius.com/Ab-soul-the-end-is-near-lyrics

I say all my life, all my life
All my life I knew I was tight
I say all my life, all my life
All my life I knew I was sick
I say all my life, all my life
All my life I knew I was ill
I say all my life, all my life
All my life I knew I was I'll be here

I'll be there, everywhere, tell the truth you wouldn't dare
Cross me like the gold you wear
Soulo flow like the solar flare in the open air
So much smoke that I'm comatose, but I still want mo'
TDE generals,
 
she ain't spiritual, but she still on Soul
God bless, God body, no fear in nobody, no thing
Can I proceed? Collect all of my proceeds?
Don't I flow like I don't bleed? Every cut is just dumb
After me there will be none
I told you there is only one (Soul!)
Yeah, and I just might be in your hood
Causin' havoc with my bros, and it's still all to the good
Horse and carriage when I roll, it's over, hope it's overstood
I'm in Hollywood, ‘cause I remember when
I had 50 cent up in da club
All my life I knew I was major, I don't need no major
I don't even write rhymes
I really shouldn't have to sign paper to dominate the
Game y'all praise on hand and knee
Just waited 'til it came to me
I just kept it real with y'all, keepin' it real with me

‘Cause I ain't got no fear, under the atmosphere
Tryin' to stay high, as long as we down here
Listen closely, see what we 'bout here
Who really 'bout that, you'll see when the smoke clears
‘Cause we really out here! (We really out here!)
We really out here! (We really out here!)
We really out here! (We really out here! Yeah, yeah, yeah!)

Uh, and it might not be such a bad idea
If I never went home again
Fuck on the same hoes again
Bumpin' ""Druggies Wit Hoes Again"" with my bros again
No, I want the world chico and everything in it
Every beverage with codeine in it
How the fuck you say I sold my spirit?
I'm still takin' blows at the Senate
Claims of Illuminati, I'm just tryna illuminate
Praise to the most high; God, Jah, Allah, Yahweh
Selassie eye,
 
and I'm proud to say
I never need a 9 by my waist
Niggas still respect my gangster, celestials respect my space
And I just might be in your hood
Causin' havoc with my bros, 
and it's still all to the good
Horse and carriage when I roll, it's over, ho, it's overstood
I was overlooked, I went overboard, now I'm overbooked
Ab-Soul-Lute just,
 my life is like an open book
Read between the lines, nigga
I did this shit legally blind, nigga
Yeah, Soulo, ho, Carson arson with Del Amo
Tell your folks I said hello, I ain't never scared, ‘cause…

‘Cause I ain't got no fear, under the atmosphere

These days, at this point in my life, I kinda really wanna use music to help people get through their days instead of just staying in the dumps, just keep going. Bring light to the situation. Maybe, you know, try to find your own personal message in that incident, that experience, and try to move forward…

Y'all got me? Everything good? Y'all can hear me?
Before we start, let me just say this, let me just say this
I'm datin' you, Day…
 wait, wait, pause, no gay shit
What's the difference between a date and a day anyway, Day?
 
A date is a day that's marked
I'm smart, and just ‘cause I know you love 'em so much
I came with name flips for days, tailored just for Day
I'm expecting Day to base his verse on data based on turds
My database said Day the basehead that date a basehead
Is he dope? No. Who gave Day the base?
Ball is what we do best
Flock his projects; that's a home run
Day, 
the baseball is what we do best
Carpe diem, that's how you say ""seize the day"" in French
I stand behind these bars for the rest of my life
I will never see the light of Day again
Now witnessing this rare occasion
I bear fruits of my labor, this Grape is green
I gotta eat on the go, Day
I hope they told you that everything that Soul say don't go a long way—don't go a long way, what?
A ho in Chipotle, no, this is food for thought
From a dog on top
We been nuts, there was a fool who thought we was new to this, but who knew this would end up
A glow stick in a uterus; that's Lyt in a box
And that's light, that's light
But Lyt like to lick twat a lot, so that's right
That's what y'all call street?
No tales from the Crip this evenin'
He slip, seems he forgot what the C meant
It's your dumbass' fault that last part was so concrete
But I guess you'd have to be kin to get that bar, b
Pardon me, I bet right about now
You feelin' like Jordan down in the Jordan Downs
In fact it's crazy that you even play ball
To clear your thoughts before 
raw backwards
And that's cool, but for this round, save the bull
Before you let the Jordan Downs and Jordan down
Now, as for the crew
Well, uhh, the villain been itchin' to skin a dog
And this nigga bought
What, a hundred and three dalmatians?
It's safe to say your mob of dots won't make it
And I'm a fan first, but it won't take too many seconds
To leave you in a damn urn
You deserve this disservice
I put this man in ER's if he don't got no manners
Man, word, I'm expectin'
Some etiquette in your segment, kid
I brought you to the 'Stu to show how we do
So all them antics and funny shit you do for the cameras don't get aired here, they can't see you
Wave your title to this tidal wave, we do
And you don't appear to be a peer to me
For real, you should kneel to me or somethin'
Fuck it, to keep it hundred, you're nil to me, that's nothin'
Heard they been raisin' raisins down on Grape Street
That's crazy, right? That's what happens when you expose them Grapes to too much Daylyt
So your chances of standin'
Much smaller than my plan to defeat you
Wait, what, do I gotta put it in photosynthesis or somethin', son? Shed some light on Day? 'Til he's cropped out
No, not now, I won't need a plant to defeat you
The sequel, this movie, won't need to be continued
You finally encountered somethin' you can't counter
Coward, you're counterfeit
You ain't gotta be in a Walgreen's pharmacy
To see Quill drug over the counter
After your mother consumed you
You were the fruit of the womb
After you were born, I'm sure you wore Fruit of the Loom
Now I'm tryna figure out, is you from Grape Street, Crip
Or just another 
fruit in this room?
It's crucial, you choose
I'm sure you don't want me to assume
I should be against the law to run into
‘Cause we all know in L.A. I'm double you
All so true, today is the day I split Day in two
What the fuck has battle rap turned Day into?
Are you from Gotham or from Watts?
Are you Batman, Spawn, or Devone?
Did you really think ""Paul Walker"" was a dope song?
If so, you were wrong
But hold on, I got one more, and don't lie to me
Do you really have a Batmobile outside, my G?
Don't be so transparent, this nigga Lyt through
If you don't know what transparent means
Let me enlighten you
If it's transparent, that means that it lets the light through
So I should smack this trans' parents for lettin' Lyt through
Like, the nerve of this cat
Lyin' with a motionless emotion,
 this nigga Day all bitch
Somebody get Quill a quilt before Quill get killed
Do Quill got skill at all, homie?
It was some Braveheart shit; all I heard was nah's, homie
Did you really expect to last, Day?
You know Revelations say that we livin' in the last days
I mean, I see you skimmed through Genesis and Timothy
But did you get to that page? You got gats?
You think your little arm'll get in the way of Armageddon?
Forget it, Day! No, really, forget this day
If I had a time machine, I'd go back in time to see
Just how many people would say yes to Day
Nobody, fam, nobody, fam, that's why I'm ahead to Day
No, no body, fam, that's why I'm a head today
No, nobody fam, that's why I'm ahead of Day
Somebody check the clock, I think I'm ahead a day
Send him to the choppin' block, off with the head of Day
It's only right I be blunt to Lyt
I only gave Lyt a match to light a blunt
I see I should have used the lighter instead
Chill, Loc, we ain't smokin' no purple
We need the fire instead
When I think of daylight, I think of shit like… breakfast, morning, birds singin', kids playin'—see where I'm goin'?
That means you better break fast
Or I'll have your family mourning'
When that bird sings, kid, I ain't playin' and you know it
But you know what? Hold on, hold on
Let me get you right, we have this shit
Take this 500 before you clap this shit up
Say this, let me say this, let me just say this
These flashin' lights got Lyt flashin', nigga, for the glory
Your buzz lightyears from here
Quill, and you tellin' toy stories
You boys bore me, that's why I'm hoggin' all lanes
All your bars Häagen-Dazs, that's on everything
Day a dairy queen, Deluxe; bless, King!
Dearly beloved, all first verse, all first verse
You know I brought a hearst
For the sausage you brought worst
Dearly beloved, here lies this little light of mine
That tried to let it shine
And I hate that we have to hear lies
From this little light of mine that tried to let it shine
But I'm ill, you men ate when I finished Lyt
You get it, Lyt? That's how you ILL-u-min-ate
And finish Lyt, good night
Hold on, hold on, hold on
Let me get you right, you got that for me?
Brought you some complimentary TDE ski masks

Question, you know how many copies 
The Matrix
 sold?
It don't matter, 
The Matrix
's old
I double cats, I ask 'em if they seen the glitch
No, no, no, face it, I got it covered
Prevail, they say the sail was a thread to hell
The gravitational stitch, ‘cause some niggas seem down
They come up with this perfectly clean round
But I hope you not doin' this cause of fear
Of the pen, I'ma prove you pussy within
But I guess it's up to you to risk your career
I retire niggas, I'm the slow leak crew
I could OD too, and even the odds some
He thought he could least get a baby victory
But all he got was ""Nah, son.""
Check this out, he not ready
Either you fight back or I Ether you
Thought you could face what I hand you
Well, this is isn't peek-a-boo
Soon as I took a peek at you, you looked shocked
Peep it, you put everything at stake
Well done, this is beef, right?
Jesus, holy cow, cut the bull, Soul, before you get meatsliced
I'm from the third, I gotta try you
Guy, you play Ryu,
 lose a ken in a street fight
Nice slow guidance with both sirens
You still couldn't see Lyt
Division, I got it covered, I'm so eye lit
Pilot, fly, I be the goblin; we battle for a stack
In fact they had to get a cataract, ‘cause I be the problem
But it's useless, use less filler, excuse the excuses
But, but, but… these asscheek niggas dead
You said you would fry Day previously
But that's what the last weak nigga said
But, but, but keep cool, Joe, ‘cause dog crazy
Get down, we turn niggas vegetable if they don't let us up
He know the heat blowers like Daffy at the casino
Nigga, you better duck
But I tell them tails we never tuck, we gon' line that ass up
I from the Watts block for decision
My profession is stompin' squares the fuck out
We played hopscotch for a livin'
But that's def, that's just plain old def
It's funny how we're all in here but bro don't listen
Have a seat, pick chairs
Picture this photo, this a Soulo, is it?
Hold up, is it because he 'bout to get smoked?
Common roll the physics, so exquisite
Thought I was in here dolo
No, bro, somebody tell Soulo this not a solo mission
The deal closed, SoHo is it
Thought you could fuck with me, gal? I gotta Cotto-split him
Look at your girl dead in her eyes
And say ""Fuck Dorothy, dog!""; I'm toto dissin'
But at this moment, everybody in the room should be scared as 
hell, as I release bars, they better bail
Objects that I process is parallel
Let's get this aligned, minus sinus
The stuff he knows flew overhead, it's cold, redemption
Stay still, as I apply DayQuil, ‘cause you look like you need medical attention, don't mind me
See where mind be is a mine, explosive, interior is inferior
This is a hobby probly, 
y'all see I got the drop on everybody
That's why I reign superior
Whether you like or not, it's Hell for you, ice plate
These blister niggas still can't overshadow a nice Day
Remember, you did say you would fry Day?
But you don't realize you're on the weak end to the streets
Preacher for they peeps, you asshole
You in the motion to grab toes, you're reachin' for defeat
I tell 'em I got the four in
Cut the sheep, it's all for the woolish
Game I play is death, get sword for the hoodish
Actin', it's Tinactin, it's all for the footage
I'm dope, I'm practical, crack to you
I need a lot of space; 
the galactic crew
, the actors knew
You feel it it's Felix, see what the old cat could do
But you got the roots stirred up, gelatin dropped and slide
This game is stormchasin'
Based on whether you got the drive
Win rounds, destroy their whole city—will they get tore?
Nay, do you realize I still got a break, brother?
When I quake in action, think of blanket jackin'; take cover
That's lightwork, Soul
Cut your lights switch, see how the light works, Soul
I cut the light switch off and your light switch off, Soul
Somebody get this nigga help!
 I mean, like, Soul, assist him
Get him help, I'm sendin' this nigga out the solar system
I mean, it's simple, Aretha Franklin; you a Soul, sister
That's enough, man, I'ma have to throw one of these masks on, man, should I finish him off?
And I told you once, I gotta give 'em the Quill
And I gotta give 'em the skill
I be on my tip, like I tried to give him the bill
New approach, Bull coach; I tried to give 'em the feel
For Watts, starvin', gotta get us a meal
Bein' modest, this is modern astrology for the real
You can't back up defeat, but I try to get up the hill
Cold, rack up the heat, but I'm tired of niggas that grill
Chicago in my blood, but I used to be the shyest
Cat form, but now I'm back searchin' for the highest
Platform, see where I come from? It was sirens, blackboards
Eyelids see the violence, what is that for?
.44 shoot, they screamin', ""Who's that guy?!""
Jesus, his face, they screamin', ""Who's that?! God!""
We be on the top, careers gettin' too high
They knew I would get a million dollars, what I do buy
That pink kid in the cup, that Majin Buu fly
Tragic, twin maggots; I grew up too fly
They askin', ""Who I?"" in front of that triangle black
That's that guy that come with the side kangol hat
We take it back from slangin' packs to the stars mission
Older now, I'm in the Rover, but it's not a Mars mission
Settle down, one child, merry; feel like I'm Marge pimpin'
Bitches wanna eat my shorts; feel like I'm Bart Simpson
I feel this a full moon, chocolate, dreams puddin'
They be likin' everything I do, they're teen wolfin'
But you got it, you got it bad
2Pac, don't watch the world sad, come back
Two watches, that's pocket change
Dude coppin' that clock exchange
Credit good, I'ma pull the card out
Better be hyesterectomy, show 'em how to ball out
Cough, they can show that they're stomach so they fall out
Whip, double roof, dog barkin' in the dog house
And I gotta give 'em the light
My people in the struggle, I gotta give 'em a fight
Ain't no equal piece of puzzle, hope God'll give us the mic
Ain't no sequel to this puzzle, I gotta give us the life
Wow, they say the Bugatti went up in price
Wow, that's a million, I'm done

Maybe my brain's bigger, getting brains quicker (Yeah)
Used to cop a little deuce
Now, I cop a whole case of Actavis to give Sprite's stock a boost
Woo! Ab-Soul, yeah I'm getting lewd
Bitches walking bowlegged out my dressing room
Was at the Travelodge, but now, we at the W
Just to shower, be out in an hour, I got shit to do (Ha)

Watch with the internet alone I enlighten the whole globe

You seen them flowers bloom, know that they grew in despair
A blessing in disguise, nobody knew it was there
My crown had been made, I just had to put it on
Now I spread my wings and let the bird of dawning sing its song

Ride Slow,These Days…,2014,"Ain't no sitting down in here, my nigga
Yeah, hahahahah
Yeah, keep sayin', oh I think niggas is laughing at me
That's right, make that spooky shit
Yo, yo-yo-yo-yo-yo-yo-yo-yo, look-look

I ride slow, these rhythms of visions of me living colossal
Ahead of my time, in time, you'll find that I'm a fossil
Know not what I do, Lord, do you have mercy on my soul?
Far as I know, I'm a poet or in an apostle
Smoking my 'dro, smell the aroma on my clothes
Rose from the dirt, so I'm down to Earth, oh, I know
You made a few bucks now you feel buck, your chains gold
My shades all black, I can do this with a blindfold
This ain't rap, this is find a mine in your mind blow
Your brains back out of your wave cap, I don't know Tae-Bo
But I kick that, you're a Kit-Kat
Life's sweet but, way down the line, you're just a snack

It gets cold on the road to the riches (yeah, I ride slow)
The cars and the clothes is expensive (yo, I ride slow)
These hoes with they nose in my business (yeah, I ride slow)
Nigga (yo, I ride slow)
These rhythms of visions of me living colossal
Ahead of my time, in time you'll find that I'm a fossil
Yo-yo-yo-yo-yo-yo-yo-yo
Yo-yo-yo-yo, yo-yo, yo (insane in the membrane!)

I ride slow, live fast, small time to big cash
Cut corners, cut loose, cut class, fuck school
Had to learn though, the harder way, pushing pennies
But, see, a three's a 16 in my sport, figgadeal me?
I'm filthy, I know it's greedy out here, I told you that
But I made my way through it like Moses did with his staff, relax
And try not to step on the crack, that'll break your mother's back
On the surface I will certainly scratch
See Mac, he made this from scratch
Just imagine what we could do with a flick of the wrist
You're puppets anyway, let's say I'm playing ventriloquist
Go this a way, go that a way, I'm scatter brain with this shit
What's that a K? Put that away, no weapons formed against
Me shall pass, remember that? I'm biblical with this shit
The tales from the Crip, on the soul of Sunday schools finna flip
Oh! (blow) The camera's gone so bring the acid tabs along
And let's all gather round and sing my fucking song
Yo, I ride slow

It gets cold on the road to the riches (yeah, I ride slow)
The cars and the clothes is expensive (yo, I ride slow)
These hoes with they nose in my business (yeah, I ride slow)
Nigga (yo, I ride slow)
These rhythms of visions of me living colossal
Ahead of my time, in time you'll find that I'm a fossil
Yo (insane in the membrane!)

Check! I ride slow, sparking like exhaust, smite a pyro
A psycho, Xannys in my cup before I pour a fo'
You nacho, mean a nigga put cheese on you
Pulling up, no headlights but there's red beams on you
Apostle, smoking on this dope, my brain colossal (Smoke!)
Helps out the flow to do tricks like a brothel (Stunt!)
Roll the lace with angel dust from pages of the bible (Stunt!)
Survival tactics, target practice if you lacking, it get drastic
Caskets If you niggas talking ass-backwards (Black!)
Up shit's creek with a tissue paddle
OG Kush make a nigga chest rattle (Smoke!)
Call your number like you just won the raffle (Ugh!)
Nigga, you Snapple sweet, come after me, it's casualty (Blow!)
Turn you into vegetables as if I dropped the celery (Blow!)
The reality is all you niggas fictions (Bitch!)
Smack you with the hand of Satan cause you need good sanitation (Ill!)
Any nigga hating, we gon' turn them to a raisin (Blow!)
One nigga, .30 clip, turn your brain into bacon bits
(Doot-doot-doot-doot!) And I ain't saying shit
Cause I'm coming from Detroit where I'm coming up short
Them niggas riding slow, AK-ing up your porch
I ride slow!
(Insane in the membrane)


I-I-I ride, I ride, I-I, ride
Niggas talking about all this lean shit
I ride slow
Nigga I been sipping this shit since, been sipping this shit
I ride slow
Silly out here, niggas wanna tell me about 2 cups
Nigga I gave this nigga Soul his first two cups nigga
I gave cuz his first cup of lean, what you niggas talking bout?
I ride slow
Cuz older than me, that's what I be talking about see? Fuck it

I ride slow, these rhythms of visions of me living colossal
Ahead of my time, in time you'll find that I'm a fossil
Alright, here right? Soulo
La, la-la-la, la la (I ride slow)
Do you wanna ride or die? (I ride slow)
What do we have here now? Run quick see
Come with me (inhale Mary) (Y)
Come with me (exhale Mary) (M)
Come with me (inhale Mary) (F)
Come with me, la, la-la-la, la la la la
Already, I ride slow

I heard they stopped making Actavis
(You know when I heard that?) While I was sipping Actavis
Fast life, slow motion in my double cup
The screw give me drive like a flat-head, every fill up
I must be Captain Phillips, these niggas don't speak my language
Residue on my debit card, don't tell my moms
That it's a lot more than marijuana in her son
I walk on the dark side, only to shed light where they ain't no sun
Deadline snapback on my mind, I ain't suicidal, I'm just fly
My rhymes Ciroc and Ayahuasca, would you like a sip?
Enlightenment from a low life that's more than likely high
What I do with eight zips nigga? You don't know the half
All these lines add up like a motherfucking graph
Rap as if I had two left feet, tryna walk a righteous path
So here's a question that I ask
What's a negative with no plus? A Benz with no bus?
A curse with no gift? Who's God with no us?

Delusional, murder marsupials when I puke a flow
Put my dick in witches from ""The Crucible""
I'm hard to get a read on, that pussy shakin, Parkinson's Disease on
Pardon me, I sneezed, blessing conscious as it speaks freely
Death is cold homie, breathe easy, loaded gun in front of me
Shoot the soul right out of Soul, yeah you my homie
You do my murder and

Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay (fuck off!)
Relax, relax my nigga (Maaaaaan!)
Calm down my mom listens to this shit, bruh (I ride slow)
You need to stop sniffing that goddamn bleach is what you need to do

Well how dare a man talk about the potency of my pack?
I snort dope that's mixed with crystal meth and gastric bypass
Satan's blood in my flesh, nobody is high as
And these days the iPad
Will tell you that your life will be no longer than an eyelash
And then float away (I ride slow) so good luck

Scared to live, scared to move these days

Your soul sits on your third eye,
 Soul sits on the throne
Told you I was the third wheel

Threes up, threes up, all around the world (World)
We ain't shooting no jump shots, but we balling, we balling
I'm from where they get jumped or shot
'Til they falling, they falling
They ain't heard one word from God
But He calling, He calling (Hello?)
I ain't never had a whole rack 'til I was 24 years old
At 25, I spent a hundred of those
And still ain't got nothing to show
Ugh, I guess that's how it is these days
Ugh, I guess it's how it goes
'Cause this world is dark and my locs is on, but I ain't afraid
ABC everything, every M you end up with is owed
And that's simple math, had to balance the good and bad
No masters, but a mastermind,

With a thang with some tits on her
And every nigga in this bitch own her

Could be the distance, yeah
You spoke the truth into existence to degrade yourself
Told me keep it G as if you told yourself
Knew that I was on the move
I got to prove my theories to be true

I know it's getting hard to think about me
I know it's hard to see me on the TV
I know you wish you never met me
I liked you better when you didn't like me
Things just ain't the same no more
Things just ain't the same no more
Still think about you everyday
And I wish I could stay
But things just ain't the same no more

I don't regret a second that we shared, hell no
In fact I often wish that you was here, right now, ow, ow
Cause' when 'Lori left me you was right there
Lord knows you had the right care
I wonder if you still praying to the East
I wonder if you ever forgave me

I know it's getting hard to think about me

I liked you better when you didn't like me

Up jumps the Boogie bitch
I boogie board on these instruments (Roll that weed, nigga)
Riding the wave like a lie detector
If I'm lying I'm flying, nah (Shake that ass, ho!)
If I'm lying I'm lying, in dirt, that's a metaphor for dying
Miming like Morpheus foresaw me saving Zion, that's
More fire, that's more fire
That's more fire, that's more (Roll that weed, nigga)
Set that mouse trap, you fuck around
Yeah you fuck around and get smoked
Got that loud pack in these Backwoods like summer camp
Dwell on that (Roll that weed, nigga)
We used to dub cassettes, but now we poppin' Percocets
I don't be in no pain, I just like how it feels
I close my eyes and follow beetles in strawberry fields
Munchie munchie, Welch's fruit snacks and Mrs. Fields
Wicked as Aleister Crowley, you niggas know the deal
(Son, do the drugs, don't let the drugs do you)
Psy-Psy-Psychedelic savage
And I'm telepathic too (Shake that ass, ho!)
Ask Al Boy and A-Mack about when me and Q did shrooms!
And that one ho was getting grooved in the next room
I flow like Russell Crowe
In ""A Beautiful Mind"" (Roll that weed, nigga)

All of the time (Roll that weed, nigga)
Don't forget my dash or you'll get left behind! (Shake that ass, ho!)

When I cross the street I look both ways
Gazelle frames, paparazzi in my face
Niggas talk more than bitches these days

Yeah, let's have some fun
Just have some fun (That dopamine, I mean dope)
Yeah, let's have some fun
Just have fun

I just wanna teach you all about the mind (Roll that weed, nigga)
The power in it, the very power of mine (Shake that ass, ho!)
It makes sense I take interest in the third eye
Due to my lack of sight, I guess it's a sacrifice
Cause I've already envisioned what the world looks like
So when it's handed to me, I won't need to look twice
They swear I read a lot of books, or I got straight A’s
Katrina cleared my absences so I could walk the stage
I never paid tuition, but I paid attention
That's why I gotta make it count when they pay admission
Took my third hit of DMT and then I melted in
(Met the devil in God's elbow) And this is what he said...

When I cross the street I look both ways
Gazelle frames, paparazzi in my face

Go, go, uh
Yeah, no roof on the jeep with a big old chain

Kendrick Lamar’s Interlude,These Days…,2014,"24/7, 365, motherfucker I'm still right on time
Oh you thought you had me all figured out?
Take it from the horses mouth, you'll never understand me
I told you my Plan B is to win your hearts before we win a Grammy
These Days ain't shit changed, different toilet, same shit
And I drank a whole gallon of laxatives by accident
Just to shit on you has-beens
Had it been for my past tense, I wouldn't be rapping
See these streets made me, broke me down
Built me up, drove me crazy
Made me hungry, made you hate me, but fuck love
It don't make dollars, it don't make sense nigga
By the way, that's DJ Quik nigga, respect or check it
These days, I'm a little more focused
Cause y'all cracked the door and I kicked it open
Yellin' get the fuck down or I will shoot
I told you not to motherfuckin' move!
Be another example
I'll take the whole industry hostage if I have to
I'll sabotage this game, a good kid?
Yeah that's only in my mama's eyes
I seen a dead body at five and that shit made me traumatized
So These Days, a little blood on my hands ain't nothing compared
To hopping out a minivan, with a mini 22 3's and the homie TuTu
And two more YGs, oh nobody got time for that!
These Days it's only time for rap!
So Herbert Anthony Stevens
You make or break bread before we break even
Before they broke our records we broke records
And wrote pieces, of history
So These Days? These accolades that's meant for we?
It's only truth that this shit was meant to be, T.D.E

Life's still a Traffic Jam (Life is still a Traffic Jam)
Life's still a Traffic Jam (Life is still a Traffic Jam)
Life's still a Traffic Jam (Life is still a Traffic Jam)
Life's still a Traffic Jam (Ready to go)
Life's still a Traffic Jam (Still ready to go)
Life's still a Traffic Jam (Still ready to go)
Life's still a Traffic Jam
Life's still a Traffic Jam...

Shit... what more did you expect? HiiiPower
For the most part, we go hard for the respect
I'm obviously ominous to my competition
And if I ain't better than Kendrick than nobody is then!
We shared our life with you
Shared our light with you even in the darkest of hours
In hopes that one day, just maybe, one day the world'll be ours
Ha, and now they look up to us like towers
For rhyming like we had super powers
They should've never let us in these offices...
Knowing good and God-damn well
How well we've been ducking officers
Laughing at the scraps they offered us in the past
And now we toast champagne to the thirst we never had!
I had my ups and downs, but I always left right
Rest In Peace Alori Joh... TopDawg for life!
And oh yeah... SOUL!

I watch that fire that we're gathered around and see that it burns similar to the fire that is inside you...",https://genius.com/Ab-soul-kendrick-lamars-interlude-lyrics

That shit weak, your bitch weak
That's too bad, my bitch bad
Smoke weed, I got plenty
Take your quarter back like McNabb
Sip lean, I got plenty, I drop a ace in a liter
Now I got a quinceañera
Ever had a chick do it on the dick to capoeira?
Kick game like Martial Arts
Kick game like Marshall Law on Tekken
The homies got weapons
Martial Law could happen any second
Getting money, blowing digits
Only sexing sexy women
(Only sexing sexy women)
(Only sexing sexy women)
That like to do them nasty thangs
You know, I like them nasty thangs
Can't fuck with them whips and chains
I got a bitch that do, but I ain't got no gavel
Baby wanna know what's under my belt
Maybe 'cause I paid so much for the belt
Call the car service, get your ass home
But just yesterday me and Agent J

You're so weak, you don't know me, Soulo so low-key
In Lord, Legends, infinity, oh, God showed off inventing me
Me and K with the promoter, drop the fo' up in the soder
I'm unraveling Backwoods
And he's bending corners, just thought I'd warn ya
What's hatteninn? I've been gone too long
But bitch I'm back again, except this time I'm old
Had that Chevy Celebrity the same age as me

You still weak, you last week
I'm next month, twist the next blunt
The homie got his chain took at the Mixed Nuts
Now we blowing big weed, lean mixed up
Nigga, don't get shit misconstrued
We gave y'all plenty time to dig our stuff
Getting women in the mood
We tell the truth up in the nude
Breaking news, breaking news
I'm enlightening like Pikachu
All I do is what you wouldn't think to do
Silk, don't you remember that vegetable
South Pole Jeans, fat laces in all our shoes
A nigga turned into an oracle
Treat the damn booth like a urinal
Smoking a stogie in a terminal
I had a dub sac in my bucket, rolling 'round like ""Fuck it""
Paul Jeremy, Doe and me tryna match a nugget
Pass the blunt to BC, AR and AJ
King Rich, YM, Python P, I put that on me

I had a dub sack in my bucket... Capital C!


I just might be in yo' hood

Fuck outta here, man, you dumb ass niggas! You niggas are silly out here tryin' to look cute and shit man. Quit playing. This is serious bruh, niggas wanna come talk to me about all this dumb shit; a nigga ain't tryna hear that man. I'ma come clean bruh, go sit down with all that my nigga. This shit's over here from the grass... (?) We gon' handle it, how handle it my nigga straight like that, bruh. Eh, niggas out here look silly, my nigga. Like bruh, if you don't know me, look at my fucking Twitter, my nigga. It's your boy A-Mack out here man, Zanzilla, slapping niggas and bitches for fun, straight like that

Niggas chased my uncle there
Through God's grace, the gun jammed
I found comfort in this pleasure
Meaning I slept the best through gun sounds
These Days it's a little different
Between me and my past, I put a little distance
Egyptian cotton, thread count vicious
Started as a dream, manifest into little Kendrick
Now everybody feel it
Even niggas who didn't know, they try to forget it!
Selective amnesia, that's an Oxymoron, These Days
Niggas ask about pressure
I grew up watching freebase literally eat the face of my hood
So basically I beat the case, I vanished but left a trace
Just in case a nigga gotta go back
Yeah, it's not for games if I say that

I just might be in yo' hood
I just might be in yo' hood

I get turnt, I get rowdy
Backwood full of some of the loudest!
I'm fucked up! I get wasted
That's a hundred dollar cup I just wasted!
I'm Twact! Twact, Twact (I get high, she get low)
Motherfucker I'm Twact! Twact, Twact
(I get high, she get low) Motherfucker!

Uh, Twact out till I pass out
If you ain't fucking with the team then you assed out
Flow dope like a crack house, bitches pill poppin'
House poppin' like a Frat House (
BOOMIN
!)
Keep 16s like a verse, nigga
Codeine got me leaning in reverse nigga
I popped a Xanny then she dropped her panties
I get the dough and bring it home, to the family
See I ain't fucking with you man if you ain't paying me
I'm from the village baby, I'm just tryna win a Grammy
Uh, smoking Backwoods back-to-back
Double-cross the squad and get boxed like Cracker Jacks
You see the look in my eyes so you know I'm strapped
A real Compton resident, yeah you know I'm that
I pulled up to the function with the pack
Turnt in this bitch to the max!

My nigga I'm twact (I get high)
Turkey bag full of that gas
Nigga I'm twact (she get low)
Styrofoam cups, no glass
Nigga I'm twact (get high)
Got them bars on me, no rap
Nigga I'm twact (she get low)
I don't even know where I'm at
Nigga I'm Twact!

I just got home, boy I'm glad I made it
The Codeine got me activated
New mix alert, Soul you have to taste it
Know I got the lean on me, like tax evasion
I mixed it with a whole lot of cannabis, mind travelling, getting throwed like a javelin
H Town slang I done poured up a Matt Schaub
Drugs got me like woah I'mma twact raw
And now on a mission just to get some cheeks
If she don't answer when I call, Imma hit delete
I don't love these hoes at all, boy I be with freaks
Cause they know if I fall it's gone be asleep
And I'm back on the road sipping mud again
Tryna stay inside the lines like I'm coloring
The cops say ""I seen you swerving, tell me why.""
I told em I ain't even gon' lie...

My nigga I'm twact (I get high)
Turkey bag full of that gas
Nigga I'm twact (she get low)
Styrofoam cups, no glass

Nigga I'm twact (she get low)
I don't even know where I'm at
Nigga I'm Twact!

Soulo ho, well known from Del-Amo to Soho ho
This ain't Arabian night but let me see your camel toe
I might even set up my camera too
Oh, do the splits on the dick like aerobics
Them other niggas talking shit but they don't know shit
No, they ain't on and ain't on shit
Yeah they on that, I'm on this...
And I don't need no necklace cause I be off the chain
And all they say is yes when everybody know your name
Got a pack of Jet fuel that they don't use for planes
Unless it's a metaphor for how high I'm remaining
Seals in the cut like Navy training
, 
along with a couple other things I shouldn't be naming
Eh, Long Hair Don't Care, how come I'm the most faded in here?

Turkey bag full of that gas

Styrofoam cups, no glass

Let me start off with this statement, I'm the mothafuckin greatest
I ain't even have too many haters, all my niggas knew I was gon' make it
From performing at pep rallys, showcases, talent shows
That I had to sell tickets for, just to get up in that ho
Now raise your hand say Soulo ho, raise your hand say Soulo ho!
Raise your hand say Soulo ho, raise your hand say Soulo ho!
I'm rolling up in the tour bus, just rolling up in the tour bus
Free said put the weed out they don't play that in Virginia
But I'm finna continue, pass the fire to my nigga Tone
Couldn't find a fire but this far from home
But we still trying, I mean we still chiefing
She thinks it's cool, she took a puff, she still freaking
I popped a bean, fell asleep, woke up, and started thinking

Man this shit pays hanging in the House of Pain
Now we sipping champagne on the motherfucking plane
Cause they feeling us, they feeling us, they feeling us

Hit the stage, then beat the case, then get the cake, then burn trees
Shake hands, kiss babies, show love, 
throw 3s
I was on the block with a quarter key, like what the fuck is a 16?
I was so anti-social, nigga wasn't outspoken
Till I picked up a mic, story of my life!
Uh, came with the piece so keep the peace
Uh, I ain't tryna hurt nobody
I ain't sweating no vendetta, champagne on my breath in the hotel lobby
You feel me? Damn right you feel me!
Got them sigh she feel me and the paparazzi film me, feel me?

Man this shit pays hanging in the House of Pain
Now we sipping champagne on the motherfucking plane

I'm feeling fine and dandy, staying awake off this Xanny
Noddin' off this weed can one of y'all find another Backwood please?
I just know that I can be, an example of what you can be
Making a way for my homies, making it easy for my family
So mama don't frown no more, mama don't frown no more
No mama don't frown no more, mama don't frown no more
Told me I'm smarter than you, you just gotta trust me yo
I stole from the record store, still selling, records though

Ain't no shame in my game
They know my name in Montreal, they sing my songs
Cause they relate, 
they feelin us, cause we can't be touched
Thank God for Top and Punch
, ho-ho-hold on, drop the drums

These bitches love Soulo, Del Amo to Soho
Fucking with them Top Dawgs, you'll just look like Toto
Do it all for Soulo, I don't even know them

W.W.S.D.,UnKnown,2014,"More than a man, I had died and rose again, yeah
Fast life, slow motion
These days

Well I've been out walking
I don't do that much talking These Days

I gotta stop smoking cigarettes

These Days
These Days I seem to think a lot
About the things that I forgot to do for you
And all the times I had the chance to

Yo, how the fuck my new girl got me jealous of other girls
I think I live in another world

And I had a lover
But it's so hard to risk another
These Days

These Days

These Days

Yo, he wrote this shit when he was 16 he said
I'm 27, this is like my whole life
This
 -

Now if I seem to be afraid
To live the life that I have made in song

You know all I like to do is keep it real
Soulo - Ho

Well it's just that I have been losing

Can I win one time

So long

Yeah, its that pain you was talking about
Can I win one time?

So many pills I should have slipped already
My lungs the same color as my lips already
Expensive clothes and sufficient funds
Me and my bros switching hoes just for fun
The money and bitches is all we care about
Very far from home if you worried about my whereabouts
Chasing the light at the end of the fucking tunnel
Pray for Sydney, send Tia a text, tell her I love you
The devil is a lie, never let him persevere
God took my angel, and left me here
And sent me here

Well I will keep on moving, moving on
Things are bound to be improving These Days

It's long term, this shit real

I love These Days

It will all make sense one day my nigga
I even been on songs with Common
It's crazy

These Days I'll sit on corner stones

Can't stop me my nigga, yeah

And count the time in quarter tones to ten, my friend
Don't confront me with my failures

Can't achieve success without failure baby

I have not forgotten them

Digging for gold in these Codeine bottles
Trying to picture potential in these Instagram models
Like, information racing around the internet
Before the iPad was invented, I had a pad of writtens
Smoking a cig on the side of the house trying to figure it out
The Axe didn't cut it, moms told me cut it out
Clem told me always take pride in my work
I clutch the mic with blessed hands at all my concerts
Why his name Soulo? How is he so smart?
We can see his four footprints in the sand when he walk
I like to refer to myself in third person from the third person
Thats a out-of-body experience of self
So I can see me for me and no one else
Don't need to see a Emmy, award or no jail
I'm at them like a cell, I just want to be free
All this chatter from the chattel nigga
I don't speak sheep
This TDE and nothing beyond that
Told Du Dog I don't even need to read the contract
As if some legal documents can stop me
Legalize, legal lies, legal eyes so I see
I did it while you were sitting wishing
Ask my nigga DZA
All my verses hearses leaving churches
Not the cheap chicken
And I love the Beast Coast
But what about the best one
What's your life without a soul?
A dead one

16 Bars (Freestyle),UnKnown,2014,"Yo, Look

I don't follow no trends
But I'm a beast and I'm hyped
Soul assassin, all I need is a beat and a mic
Like Joseph Jackson
When I kill it, I feel so alive
And I get high so much that I don't know goodbye
So what's the word?, I'm down to earth but i was 'posed to fly
Life threw for me a loop, cool roller coaster ride
I never complain, I never play the blame game
Fuck the world, my dick hang like a crane chain
In other words I'm ready
My teachers thought I was sharp, my every word's a machete
Halt! Who goes there? Have no fear, it's just I
Who showed you what you can't see with just eyes
I kept it justice and poetry over beats and hoaxes
My city win like the Chicago beat
I took a chance and rapped like I'm a Chicago breed, for realer
If I ain't the most dope, than it's Mac Miller
'Coz these days I wear many faces
Rollin' up a drough tree Californicatin'",https://genius.com/Ab-soul-16-bars-freestyle-lyrics
To The Max,UnKnown,2014,"I wake up every morning to text messages
From foreigners saying they love me, they miss me
They want me, are you in town?
When are you coming over, are you around?
How’s life treating you? Are you holding it down?
Can you wear my T-shirt? Can you come to my store?
How much for a verse from Kendrick Lamar?
Is Q really from Hoover? Is Rock still signed to Tech N9ne?
And this is just when I rise, imagine my whole day
My momma smiling more than ever, man and it’s so strange
It’s what I asked for though, I can’t complain
I wanna say “I told you so” but that won’t change a thing I’m afraid
I paid my little sister’s rent last month, man, that was great
My grandpa thought I wouldn’t graduate
Now I’m selling out shows and he’s stoked and shows all in his face
I even put my step pops in his place, for questioning my objective in this place
I don’t blame him, I’m just saying, always knew I was the man
I owe nothing to no one, except those who told me I was the one
When lowkey I wasn’t, that was what I was becoming
Now I’m buzzing and everybody my cousin, that’s phony
Y’all don’t know me, where was y’all when I was lonely?
A pack of Black and Milds every twenty four hours
Skipping showers ‘cause I felt dirty, unworthy of power
Though I never cursed the Lord, but I questioned his motives
I still do, except now, I’m exceptionally focused
However the road ends, I’m rolling, say amen
You foes won’t stop me or succeed like I can
I see snakes, the grass must be cut, is it Wednesday?
And I’m  happy especially nip it at the bud now
And what is happening exactly? I’m sick of the smoke signals
Like a green cross in a dispensary window
Unit 6 woulda been dope but the industry wouldn’t let it
Creativity don’t tend to mix with business endeavors
Whatever though, you know the anthem is get money and some
Become a legend and leave a legacy for your grandson
I told Lani I’mma do it, and I did it, hope she forgive me when she hear me saying shit like
“G’s up nigga, hoes down, if the bitch can't swim, then she gon’ drown in it”

You know I stay on my humble but these days ain’t fuckin’ with me (ain’t fuckin’ with me)
I go from Carson to Harlem, I hold it down, how couldn’t you see? (how couldn’t you see?)
You know I’m here for the long term, it’s my turn, pull up a seat (pull up a seat)
Go ahead and light up the smoke and throw up your hands and wave with me
Where’s Max B when you need him?
Where’s Max B when you need him?
Pour up your drink and wave with me
Where’s Max B when you need him?
Where’s Max B when you need him?
Where’s Max B when you need him?
This is the new wave now jump in the sea

Ay yo, y’all niggas stay wavy man, I love y’all man
Keep the wave goin’ I told y’all I was gonna leave y’all with that wave
About 500 out there in the  county
Man y’all stay strong, I’m still staying strong, I’m focused
I’m on my way back, prophecy will be fulfilled
It’s wavy for life, don’t forget it I’m still wavy

Still a shit talkin, blunt sparkin
Henny bottle to the face type nigga
Take yo mama on a date type nigga
Half a pint, I mean an eight my nigga
Straight act bitch, I'm too throwed to react shit

Havin dinner on lobster boat
I spit the shit to give Barack a poke
Give a cop a choke
Bumpin Flocka in the chopper smoke
Nigga, light the dope nigga
Yo, light the dope, no hope for the weak
Four Os in the cream, with four hoes in the jeep
Two cups, cause its only for me, you know
Came up off of one too many Narco's and parked yo shit
Dolla Darko, backwood full of ARCO
Opiates flow and I hope my heart go
Still jumpin niggas after rap shows
Still rob a nigga if the cash low
Same nigga sleepin back of class yo
Miseducation gettin bad though
The government is like the fucking Muppets
Obama just another fucking puppet
You know it and you motherfuckers love it
Ain't shit changed unless you do it my nigga

I feel like i'm finished soul searching
I feel like i know my soul purpose
I appreciate your purpose
From what I got from that, I know that it's worth it
An aside from that, I know I could give it all back with interest
To show my sentiments that they be interested in Soul
Glow like Afro-Sheen, I've always been a natural
Disasters happen every time I wake up, asshole
Take us for what we make up, that's cold
As a chain from Jacob
Ain't no limitation to my style, i go to Hell
With a barrel and a arrowhead and put the fire out
Off a high amount of Reefer, a bean or 3, four of lean
Exposing the holes and the hoaxes affecting this globe
In a flow nobly, to most it's so serene
I told Nicole at RapGenius i'm just sewing seeds
It's just a little Inception to get your thoughts processing
On the way to the club, i figured it out, I'm Lupe Fiasco on drugs
No religious preference, just bundles of love
I must admit, i like a chick that call herself a bad bitch
She took the power out of the word and made it fit
Like we did with nigga, my nigga that's real shit
That's innovation, i'm so sorry if that's degrading
And it's the ? ? ? making the way to the real truth
They say the West coast is back, that's real cute
But where was you when me and Rock, Dot, and Q was in the stu
Beating the mic up, black and blue
Watching the sky turn black and blue
Wishing one day you get a clue
That was like '06 bitch
And my whole squad sick
We got the flu

Won't you open your eyes

I got it twisted like Twizzlers, but trust me, I'll be fine
'Cause every dark cloud has a silver line
Which means I'll turn my silverspoon to gold in no time

I’m high cause I fly with Loriana’s angel wings
Not cause I smoke weed, we in the era of the Pros
If you peepin' this your speaker Is worth 47 Karat gold, Soul
Yo, correct me if I'm lyin', you got a Hublot, but we both know
You still check your iPhone to tell the time
Only time will tell, you're atomic as my microscopic
You tryin' to spit a verse
I'm trying to crack the macrocosms of the universe
It's all Mathematics!
I multiply division like I was fitted for glasses
The difference between me and you is
All you do is subtract, all my tracks sub
To sum it up that ain't adding up, I've had it up
To here with this shit I be hearin' These Days
Marvel Comics' superheroes in capes with marbles for brains
But I'm the Peter Parker in this World Wide Web
Spider senses tingling, move like I have 8 legs
I got next, cause I show them how to use their head
Rip the arms of a grizzly with my bare hands
I bet you play dead and I bet they think
That I'm delivering babies the way I bring in the bread
And I hate to address it but niggas wearin' dressses now?
Hey, it do cost a lot to live this here lifestyle
Cash money talk, bullshit walk a million miles
And I don't even write, where am I supposed to draw the line?
If skills sold, truth be told, I'd actually be Rapsody
Half of these niggas sell pussy after the
Top Dawg that mastered this craftsmanship
Ain't cop these Margielas to go back to the ave then Crip
To make you more jealous cause now we getting paid per view
Cash stashed in the plasma, that's a Pay-Per-View
And I still remember what Pac's Pop told us
""Keep your enemies close nigga, watch your homies""
And it's the ones that smoke blunts with ya, troll your insta
Now they wanna grab the guns and come and get ya
My little sister just did molly for the first time
While I'm rolling with models, forgetting I'm a role model
Who else you know who shot across the whole nation
No MTV Jam or radio rotation
So don't ask me about Kendrick and Q
Jay Rock, Zaywop and SZA's sexy ass too
Cause I was thinking Long Term before I met them
I've been through Hell and back I deserve Heaven

Trouble,Welcome to Los Santos,2015,"I'm gonna get in my car
But wherever I go
Seems like trouble will find me
And I don't want trouble to find me

I admit I play hide and seek with the violence
String theories together just like a violin
Red roses, blue violets
The top pick in the cockpit
That's fly shit
Like defecating on a private plane, it's simple
G4 with it, women with me
In the present, here's a test
If you tour the future then the past represents death
Life, will it take me under? I don't know
The good die young and the ugly get dough
I feel this prickly feeling on the back of my neck
The reaper tippy toe behind me everywhere that I go
That's why I ride slow, I used to be in a rush
Fast life, slow motion
These days, I'm so focused
And as soon as the chauffeur hold this door open I'ma


Here's a tiny tip
There's no escapin' the trouble that come with this grand hustle
You willin' to give everything for the glistenin' wrists
Findin' the right fabric to keep your family knit
Vanity slave, runnin' red lights, smokin' weed, they in love with you
When you're untouchable, sonny
You was born to fuckin' die, 'til then get money
The belly of the beast ain't no tummy, you mistaken
Track record longer than a train station
You just record tracks, what a waste of wax
Name an individual exempt
From a candlelight vigil and bring me his head
Nobody knows the trouble I've seen
Optimistic but they say I need an ophthalmologist
Now they just look at me like they owe me apologies
So many red eyes I might need Visine
Audio pilot, that's why I'm so high up
The trouble still finds us like a citation, that's why I'm hatin'
The waitin' and silent conversation with God like
Why the Hell is Heaven so far?
Don't need a stairway, I need a rocketship to blast off
So what? No buts, I work my ass off
And all my champions comply
It's do or die when I ride, Tracy Chapman didn't die, nah
 x2
I'm gonna get in my car, I'm gonna drive real fast
But wherever I go
Seems like trouble will find me
And I don't want trouble to find me

No more, no more, no more
I don't want trouble to find me no more
Said I don't want trouble to find me no more
I don't want trouble to find me no more
No more, no more, no more, no more",https://genius.com/Ab-soul-trouble-lyrics

Servin' serpents with sermons with curse words

24/7 all day every week
Numerous funeral services for PaKK music beats

My heart pump the same blood as Jehovah's son
Or Joseph, if you wanna go there
Hail Mary coming up with lies to tell fairies out of nowhere
Can't help my selfish desires
My life is 'bout the vices, nigga (yeah, so)
It could all be so simple, but it's complicated
I go around the whole nation, saying ""Stop the violence""
But it's ten times hard enough alone fightin' temptation
Face facts, still wicked as Aleister Crowley
You niggas know me
No, you niggas don't know me, I take that back
Noticed the dead man that's chalked out
On the bottom of the brim
Of my deadline snapback, I used to shop at Lids
But I'm still over niggas heads, like ceilings and bright ideas
I'm just an awkward Carson kid with chandelier up in my shed
My soul on fire, got this threatenin' nature from Ras Kass
An atom is a molecule and Adam was a maricón
But if he would've never ate that apple, he'd be mad sad
And would've never pulled the leaves off of Eve
And seen all that ass
Like a true mack, true that, true that, sit tight
Listen, listen, hear and understand
Or just give me some insight
You get on your knees every night
To pray to a man that you barely understand
Or have even seen with your eyes closed
Then turn around and do the same thing
Get on your knees, then put a ring
On the woman that you wanna call your wife
Somethin' ain't right, yo

Way back when I was in grade school, I learned about history
But what about her-story—did anybody ask?
Hm, with all disrespect
I think the American flag was designed by fags
I had it locked before the spotlight
I got a gold key and Benjamin Franklin's kite, nigga, I'm bright
This HiiiPower shit is limitless
You tryna fuck a model
When I'm tryin' to deflower Queen Elizabeth
Just to be precise, who knew that Genesis really meant
The genealogy of ISIS? This shit ridiculous
The chicken came before the egg is my hypothesis, and
This ain't a album, this an algorithm, yeah
We went from pickin' cotton for men in wigs and stockings
To liberation and renaissances—what is this nonsense?!
And we don't speak on sexism much as we really should
The black man could vote before the woman could
You singin' hymns in church, I'm lookin' for the her's
In 66 books in the Bible, they ain't let a lady say one word

What’s happenin'? Another baptism by Pastor Black Lip
I'm mashin' across the masses, my movement massive
I'm low-key, like a locksmith workin' on both knees
You nosy, wiretap vans,
 
got fur where my toes be
I'm cozy,
 
act like you know me
Wicked as Aleister Crowley,
 
I just might OD
Overly dedicated, just like my homie
Second to none in the first place, I need a trophy
Doing whatever I please, it's like, ""Fuck your feelings!""
Man, I got so many flows, them shits come with ceilings
What's my name? They call me Ab-Soul, the Abstract Asshole
I'm levitatin', way too crazy
Way too wavy for your sandcastle

Ayy, man, what’s happenin'?
Another baptism by Pastor Black Lip
I'm mashin' across the masses, my movement massive
The Backwoods with the gas in it

Throw that wack shit up in the trash can

We don't wanna hear that wack shit no more
No more
No more, no more
No more, no more

I'm goin' loco, this nigga Soulo back in this ho though
Oh no, you watchin' Hulu, I run the show though
Is it music? Voodoo? I don't know
But don't confuse me with D'Angelo, I'm the angel though
Spooky,
 
hope your army got lots of armor
‘Cause we don't die, we just multiply, divide and conquer
Remember when the Battle Mongers called me a reject
'Til I had all this heart and honor, demand my respect
Now I walk through C-A-R-son like I'm a hero
Steps ahead and stackin' bread up, speakin' of heroes
4-7 shit, fuck it, fly to the Beast Coast
Just to sag down Troy Ave quotin' King Steelo
Pass the pot, let me skillet
The temperature is scaldin', the novices make me nauseous
I was like a swami of Jay Electronica until he figured
Dizzle wouldn't admit that he would body him for a milli
I told Kenny keep quiet, I'ma get him
We don't need dirt on your hands, gettin' the key to the city
You feel me? Hurts when your OG
Who's supposed to be a G-O-D
Is standin' next to King Kunta feelin' like Toby
Yeah, Moos, what I gotta do, boy?
I'm just waitin' on your cue to take him to school, boy
Yeah, but fuck all this wordplay
Top, tell these fuckin' stooges I'm dangerous, keep away

Take your time, baby!

I get the feelin' that you only playin' hard to get
‘Cause you ain't forget how much I love a challenge
I know we were divided to restore the balance
Hope I still get you wet while you bendin' over backwards
Watchin' over me in ecstacy, expectin' me
Your number is 6 and 50 interestingly
I hope you're still blue, with golden ovaries
On your tippy toes for me, just how you 'posed to be
They spoke of us in Cairo quite some time ago
How these Adamines adapt to this is incredible
They love to go to sleep but hate to be awake
Treat the eye of Horus as if it's just a symbol
Unattainable, they read the wrong rights
They see the signs but ain't see what the sign saw
But luckily, uh, love is the only law, uh
Love is the, Love is the only…

Love, love
‘Cause all my thoughts are lavender and pastel green
And you the only one that know what I mean
You know what I mean

And they say our separation was sacrificial and all
But I'm in awe
These hybrids gettin' high, but they don't get it at all
The pain of division is nothin'
The joy of disillusion is all, but all in all, man
I know you a modest Scarlet Woman
Like to say you everything but nothin'
But you nothin' but my everything
How shall I explain? Ayy, Mac

One time for the women
Two times for the ladies
Three times for the bitches
Can't forget about the Queen

Queens, we are noddin' back
Understand we are his back
And when he puts the arc in your back
Understand that we took him to Heaven
Where those golden arcs are at
Golden as sundrops, Queen
When he looks in your eyes
You show him where the stars are at
And your beautiful, beautiful darkness
And in return he replies that
""Girl, I'll be your knight, your knight in shining armor
‘Cause you're my heart, Queen""
And lying on his chest our hearts beat box
And you and I are queens
We remind him that he can be all ours
‘Cause we all gods
And God is Queen and God is love
And love stays above all
Heaven, stars, queen, God, God

Love, love, love
Love is the law, love is the only law
Love is the only law, love

Resonate with your receptors, you never knew existed
Your phone on silent, you got an alibi for your boo
And before you say bye, you say you love me

Put my thumb up in her butt, then roll like a was bowlin'

And she was born on two eleven; that’s a robbery

Might pay your rent if you suck good dick
And you know what our time apart meant
Pardon me, if I'm arguably

Got a couple shows up on the other side

Shows jumping, we've been hittin' licks
Money flowin' like we flippin' bricks
Now I don't know if I've ever been in this town
Flip a switch, killing niggas like I pulled the plug
Quarter pound of piff to fill the lungs
Got the whole crowd yelling, ""Feel the buzz,"" it's lit
I call her, one DM
I land around noon, but I fuck by 1PM, FIENDS

Burnin' dirty money but I keep

And ya safe ain't safe
If ya heat don't wave back but life is cold that way

Had the work tucked, guns in the truck
Licenses suspended, but remember;

All I do is beat the case, all I do is beat the case
All I do is beat the case, all I do is beat the case

Pt. II: Straight Crooked

Ruffled up a couple feathers when I called Barack a puppet, yo
Now that Trump is POTUS
I know this whole election is just another Muppet Show
That ain't even none of my business, though
Whatever's your cup of tea
Even lil' Niemah voted for Hillary
I'm a entity, never mind my identity
My king Slim hit me with a quote that sticked with me
A criminal's best asset is his liability
(That was crazy, lie-ability)
Do what thou wilt, nigga (Soul!)
Cause these niggas'll have you swim across the ocean
Just to drown you in a lake
I had to be a little crooked just to make sure I was straight
Word, word yea, just to make sure I was straight
I had to be a little crooked just to make sure I was straight

I wonder if you was crooked though reality's awake
I had to do some crooked shit to make sure I was straight
I wonder if you was crooked though reality's awake
I had to do some crooked shit to make sure I was straight

Don't sock him, Ali
The righteous will remain righteous and the filthy will remain filthy
In a sense, we all guilty, yeah

Man, I hate quotin' Jay Z, but cuz just too tight
Is he a Blood? Is he Crip? Is he that? Is he this?
Will he do it? You know, it!
Now every time I say ""it"" it's in reference to my dick
You can suck it if you want to
Every time I say ""it"" it's in reference to my dick
And you can suck it, motherfuckin' bitch!

Listen, bitch!
When it's in you the sentiment is incredible
Winter fresh even, I even undress your winter clothes
When it's out, instead of worryin' about where it's at
You'd rather rack your cap
About where it's goin' or where it's been
Where are we goin'? I'm beginning to see an end
Don't bring Larry King in this
Sniff the evidence on my clothes and go through my cell phone
And now I'm in jail for leavin' out a few details, oh well

It's wifey or WiFi (Ayy!)
Wifey or WiFi (Ayy!) wifey or WiFi
Got some niggas in the pen that really gotta face time
She just bitching ‘cause I missed her FaceTime
It's wifey or WiFi (Ayy!)
Wifey or WiFi (Ayy!) wifey or WiFi
Got some niggas really havin' issues in the cell
She just bitching ‘cause them other bitches in my cell

Oh well, oh well
I guess she wanna go to war then
I guess we should warn the warden
Oh well, oh well

Alright, I want you to tweet me right now
If you're using your third iPhone
It's wifey or WiFi, wifey or WiFi

It's wifey or WiFi, wifey or WiFi

Oh well, oh well
Oh, I hit you with the hash back

Ayy, my nigga lil' Riley got into it with his mommy
They be fightin' all the time, so I ain't pay it no mind
He said: ""God, she could really be the Devil,"" I said ""Chill!""
He smacked his teeth
And shook his head and said ""No, for real!
You know I love her, but she could really be a pain in the ass
Matter fact, fuck that! Pull out your jack real fast!
Real shit, my nigga, now glance at the keypad
This that mind-bogglin' shit you like to throw in your raps
And this might be your best yet; notice how every number
Represents three letters of the alphabet
Like, 2 is A-B-C, 3 is D-E-F
4 is G-H-I,"" I said: ""I get it, alright!""
He said: ""Now trip off this, listen to me, Soul
I know you off the shits, but I'ma need you to get a grip.""
I said: ""Be serious,"" he said ""Dial M-O-M.""

Pt. II:  P.M.S

All because of this penitentiary mind state, is it my fate?
For God's sakes, why did I have to lose the case?
I kept it real, and I ain't never been fake
I'm feelin' like Biggie when he lost Faith
See, this penitentiary mind state, is it my fate?
For God's sakes, why did I have to lose the case?
I kept it real, and I ain't never been fake
I'm feelin' like Biggie when he lost Faith

Look, there's sixty seconds left, I'ma have to get back later
Your boy chasin' this penitentiary paper
Tell my momma stay on point
Your phone hit her on three-way
Then, fuck it, I'ma hit her on that other joint
First term, nigga, but I did it like a vet
Hung up the phone, and when I asked: ""Who had next?""
It was one of the lifers, all nest with no neck
Gotta stay with my striker, no nigga is no threat
I swipe my knife on the under
But I can still hear it in my head
When he said: ""That's right, youngster
Just stay focused, sleep with your hands open
Beat 'em with a long-handled spoon
When you deal with smokers.""
I sag low when I walk the yard, hold my head high
Yaddada to them Bay niggas; me, I'm from the Westside
Lookin' for a gram to steal, ‘cause I'm tryin' to get high
Thinkin' about my fake-ass bitch on the outside
Out of sight, out of mind, shit, I don't mind
Long as a nigga make the paper when he doin' time
Right, look… fuck it, I'm lyin', I'm just really tryin' to hold out
Thought of some trick runnin' dick in my bitch mouth

I'm conflicted to my amazement, I'm just amazed
Slim, silver spoon in my mouth
Spoiled little Carson kid with chandelier up in my shed
Future's looking dim and Ab-Soul wear shades
Uh, cause Punch told me to punch him in the face
Make a statement, lead slaves to salvation with my way with words
I kept the Soul in the alphabet
The alpha-male in my era, I'm here to baffle them like the Baphomet
They ain't know what the cover of my second album meant
I'm in the booth if I'm asking you where the bathroom at
Before the whole wide world eye balled Top Dawg
They wouldn't even give this cat a rack to perform
Sure Lori was more than empathetic
But the seven hundred I got took her to Lawry's instead of IHOP
My high-school sweetheart turned my ticker so bitter
Still staying strong for Ray, CJ, and all our little sisters
Vaneesha just had Jaleel, that's my third nephew
Cory's adorable and Cody still missed you
All my thoughts are lavender and pastel green
If you was Nuit you would know what I mean (Nuit!)
Hundred proof Absolut in the back of your Acura

My mentor asked me ""what happens after Control System?""
Wanted to tell him ""the system controls me,"" please

They can't take it
Long lost member of Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
Getting high with a little bit of help from my friends
The rifles to my rivals all my homies got a homie
That bodied one of my homies, yo that cycle is psycho
A coward killed my brother Jorgiano and his momma
And I'm complaining about a album, what is my problem?

Soulo, you know God was alone for eternity?
Yet he wasn't lonely
You gotta love, love is create
Create, create

They shot Mirelli Pervis in the face
He survived due to God's grace
Ironically him and my uncle share the same birthday
Is it fate or is it faith?
I just might be in your hood still
Lonely soul itching for a love that I've once known but I've outgrown it
I told Famous be patient, I'm in the hills
While this world is caving in and I'm living a vacation
Or so it seems, to the wig it's all in
Won't hesitate to find a coffin to make these niggas crawl in
I tried to stall him but I ain't have no alternative
I told him to think smart, he told me get it how I live
Point taken, Lord, why have you forsaken us?
Blasting at Satan for salvation, feels Pagan
Graced in the Land of Canaan
But my new world translation speaks of a different arrangement
When Death meets death, eternal breath fills my lungs
Death forever paid in the name of God's son
Currently wasting away in this wicked system
Scared to pray for forgiveness cause I ain't sure if I repent it
Oh what an existence
In fact is this really living?
Drowning in my own expenses
While tryna make Soul listen to my infinite wisdom

I said leave me lone, leave me lone, leave me lone
Leave me lone, leave me lone, leave me lone
I said leave me lone, leave me lone, leave me lone
Leave me lone, leave me lone, leave me lone

How Jesus is in the bible, he don't get no pussy at all
A 33 year old virgin, yeah it's crazy

Probably just relapse, cause that's what ill niggas do
Real ill, won't even pop a bottle without poppin' a pill
Can't have a meal without picking up the bill
Should be more concerned with my health
But I'ma die trying to get this wealth, pay attention nigga
I've been going platinum, they just politicking
Fuck-boys acting up, like an adult film audition
I'm just eating these rappers up, sending artists to the mortician
I'm just with my niggas hanging, case of champagne
Need some water but I'd rather me a martyr for the cause
Nigga y'all niggas still don't get it
The juvenile that never went to juvenile hall
It was 400 degrees on Turmont
The homies playing with the strap off safety
And my lady at the time she stayed on gun lock
The irony in that alone is crazy
I come up with shit like that that's why they say I'm crazy
Maybe, I'm with the shits, I'm off the shits
The (YMF) (Soul!)
Rockstar lifestyle might not make it
But I guarantee she make it to the penthouse naked
You niggas been outdated
Like the bitches I dated way way way way back when
Now I'm getting brain in the tinted Maybach Benz
It's rented but I'm in it nigga
I done paid back more insufficient funds in the last 5 months
Than you gonna make in this whole year
On the mountain top about to cry
Cause it gets so lonely up here, shit
Is anybody out there?
Can anybody hear me?
In this jaded generation of complacency
Siri don't even take us seriously
But that's some other shit just being honest with you
Right hand on the bible with you (amen)
My ancestors came on the mothership

Portishead in the Morning / / / HER World,Do What Thou Wilt.,2016,"Pt. I: Portishead in the Morning

Reporting live from the...
February 23rd 1987: “Quintessential” supernova burst on the scene. Light from the brightest supernova of the 20th century reaches Earth from 168,000 light-years away. At the University of Toronto's observatory in the foothills of the Andes mountains, 30-year-old astronomer Ian Shelton was looking at photographic plates in the wee hours of February 24, while listening to Pink Floyd‘s The Wall

I'm the brightest silver lining
'Cause I'm the brightest silver lining
Don't make me, make me take my light back

Demigod with a record deal
Everything's puny to me, you a newbie
I'm from Nibiru, microphone check one, two, three
Master of ceremony no matter the territory, I'm cozy
Oz. of OG, my brain playin' Ring Around the Rosy
The fried egg in my head defies science
I'm Bill Nye, goin' to great heights to stay the highest
Call me Soulo ho the Prophet
But do you really comprehend it?
 (No!)
Is it prophet meaning messenger
Or profit meaning expenses?
Pick it… ah, forget it!

I'm the brightest silver lining
'Cause I'm the brightest silver lining
Don't make me, make me take my light back

See, right here, right? We need that chick from, uh
You know that chick from Portishead
“When he walked outside the observatory”
I'm the brightest silver lining
And none of y'all don't feel this shit?

The philosopher gettin' stoned
It's no doubt in my mind I found the philosopher's stone
Thought these were just songs that I write? You're wrong
Move my mouth and move a mountain with ease as well
Dead ass, I'ma live forever like the HeLa cell
My nigga Hatchet said: “Ab, you a genius, but you gotta go stupid
Sometimes in order to win, you gotta lose it”
My goal was to hip the hitters to glitches in the system
Do we really want to go to Heaven?
Ain't no bitches mentioned (This is a man's world!)
And I ain't-a sexist, I enlighten sisters too
And, oh yes, it's Bohemian Grove baby, not groove
One time for the women
Two times for the bitches
I'm from another galaxy, I'm actually an android
Look me up on your Galaxy's and your Android's
The Devil was created, he is not a creator
And energy can neither be created or destroyed
It's YMF, nigga, YMF, nigga!
If I ain't the Messiah, I'm a mess, nigga
YMF, nigga! YMF, nigga!
If I ain't the Messiah…

I'm the brightest silver lining
I'm the brightest silver lining
I'm the brightest silver lining
I'm the brightest silver lining
I'm the brightest silver lining
I'm the brightest silver lining
Don't make me make, me take my light back

That spot did turn out to be supernova 1987A. When he walked outside the observatory, the object was visible to the naked eye. The plates covered an area near the Large Magellanic Cloud, when he spotted an exceptionally bright spot

Remember that first or end before you've begun
I rhyme like I'm God's only begotten son
She so loved the world she gave Soul the world

Matt need a new crib for his baby
So big, he be forgettin' where the crib for his baby
Dot told me, ""This time, we demandin' respect""

Yeah

OnDaSpot Freestyle,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Soul brotha, number after one
The brightest out the bunch, compare me to the sun
Skinny as a motherfucka, probably skipped lunch
Hungry with the same appetite as Big Pun
They say I'm too much, I ask how come
There's no 
one else with opposable 
thumbs with such a touch
You help a nigga once and he'll probably forget it
You help a nigga twice, you're officially his crutch
I understood this back when I was just a young lad
Couple lies and a couple lines in my notepad
My composition wasn't even competition
Now I'm dropping shit in the booth more than the pot I piss in
And might I mention
I dive in the pool of violent piranhas
You find another guy with my description
My prerogative is simply to annihilate you simply
I got fired from my job, but I gets busy
And I ain't tryin' to ask for more than I deserve
So understand when I say I need a million today
You blend in like chameleon
But I stand out, like I exited the building
Fuck yo feelings, I'm just sayin', you ain't nothin' like Ab, nigga
We're night and day like Meek Mills and Mac Miller
I'm sippin' Remy watchin' Martin droolin' over Gina
If I had the opportunity I'd turn her out, like Tina
But not like Ike, I'd take a much different approach
Roll in a river 'til she hit them high notes
No disrespect, I'm just a nut, tryin' to get some cash
You's another nigga in my way, tryin' to get some scratch
I'm tryin' to get to San Tropez, or somewhere close to that
All cause I heard Jay say it in a fuckin' rap
Now make that ass clap, I know this ain't that type of song
But I get pussy too, they only like me for conscious songs
Whatever that means, I swear I'm so aware
But I wear shades everyday, my vision gotta be impaired
Plus you would think they found me in Korea somewhere
And I'm just another nigga, like Farrakhan with curly hair

If I told you I killed a nigga at sixteen would you believe me
Or see me to be just a angel that's easy to please
Angled a company by a gang of niggas that squeeze
Once their marks are your tire marks, that's the fuckin' mark of the beast
I try so hard to follow God
You know, anointed oil, plant some Bibles in the front yard
Rebuke at the turmoil
My dreams of being like Jordan are spoiled
My temperature high that it boiled, 'til your homicide is good for you
I'm loyal to my feelings, I try to stay righteous and cordial
But these feelings are twenty-twos a producer, new Zoo
These gorillas they let loose at 2:
45 on 
245 street
Colt
 45 and shoot
, walkin' outside and slippin' like Kenneth Coles
On a slab of grease, body found in a pothole
Forks, white tees just to cover up his long nose
And that bitch'll hang to my knee like a dress
I confess I'm depressed
I suppose I'm more than likely infest my best in the Lima
Hop out, gun your ass down in front of your mama
I try to follow God like Bishop
But when they see that you bitcher, prepare for a ditch of
Dirt, I give you a list of families that hurt, but oh well, fuck it, that's life
And that's the color your son chose to put on tonight
So in self-respect, just know I say it's a honor
Hop out, gunnin' us down in front of your mama, uh
Like kindergartners my vision's bothered
By vigilantes that harbor on street corners
Try your hardest to harvest bundles of weed on ya
The starving, the speed on ya
Stampede on ya, impede on your pockets that peed on ya
Dreams of us livin' lavish in fabrics of fine linens
Spinnin', established with women, dinin' and laughin'
But this environment got us violent, ready to crash
Into society, take the driver's seat, hope you're fastened
Your seat belts twice when I rolled them dice, I crap
So many times I could build casinos from scratch
Too many daps you might receive from the things you achieve, relax
That's what my mental say, but my physical's been detached
I'm on some other shit, like fuck the government, I'm higher rankings
Where the mothership? I made the covenant that I was changin'
But my luck has been quite disgusting when reality tainted
Where the fuck you been? Left him face down like he was plankin'
In a cold world where old girl and a home boy got a motive
You could bitch, girl your tribulations, that sensation's insultin'
Got a wifey or mistress, nigga which 
one you indulgin

I’m broke, but almost famous

Fucked up I know this
Its why I get fucked up
Tryna let shit go, like it was stuck
I thank god for the flow, niggas say I’m so real
It it wasn’t for Hip-Hop I’d hang myself with a rope
That’s just how I feel

Look, my life is like a movie
I'mma keep it real
I came up on Power Rangers and oatmeal
Then it was BET and Internet
Then it was white Adidas and cigarettes
Then it was black and milds and blasphemy
Then it was weed and women’s physical anatomy
Now I dabble in em all
My life style is ill, think I’m wrong?
Fuck you with a condom on
That’s just how I feel

Listen, my life is like a movie
I guess that means I’m acting
I’m the lion in the zoo; main attraction
It's my time to kill Samuel L Jackson
Easy as ABC, coulda been the 6th Jackson
Ab-Soul the epitome of talent
All started with a mechanical pencil and this yellow tablet

Truthfully, I would do it cuz the bootleg ain't clear enough to watch
Watch how I flip it like a blue dolphin --
That's a water mammal on ecstasy, yo I gets retarded
And we can go to war if you wanna
You could plan it but to you I'm like a planet -- the largest
Panic when I'm marching on your turf like a sergeant --

Better yet, your whole style is questionable
Come to my neck of the woods, strangle your neck in the booth
Saying you next to who, motherfucker?
Kick the bucket, maybe this pale will do
From the moment they broke my umbilical, I was known as the coldest criminal
With -- enormous genitals, it -- is no subliminal, my shit is more literal
And ironic as witnessing death in your living room
Passed the bud, I'm finna run in motherfucking mud
Run a motherfucking lap -- around a gas pump
Gassed up -- don't add fuel to the fire
That's how you get your ass whooped
I hold the belt -- welterweight rappers need help

Know I stay with a verse --
Like I stay with a plaque till I'm laid back in a hearse

Copping a clean suit to wear under the dirt -- fuck

I wish I never heard of you rappers -- (really though)

You hesitate to test the waters of a fish tank
You first-timer -- You need more than one-liners
Your color scheme is undone, all you have is the primer
Paint pictures like art designers --
Architect when I often draw the tech
Then put your carcass over your set when the words eject
Celibacy flow --
Really don't matter the sex, just letting you know --
Women could get it quicker like chlamydia nigga
Disease-infested, please consider --
The piece of her comprehension inside my jurisdiction
And you can't deliver

If you could see my thoughts I recollect in the booth --
Self genocide rhyme, hang yourself from the noose --
To spit iodine from a spectator's view
Punch is off his rocker, locked in Davy Jones' locker

In serving niggas tip the waiter before you leave the table

Who told me about some money making schemes he gone show me
G's he gone grow me
To help me get started, I thought it seemed like bologna
Thought he was a phony
But then, a couple of weeks past
He calls me on the cell-y and tells me to meet fast
Brought a brief case with a couple of G's cash
Talked it over with Fash
And gave him the G-pass
He knew all about the spots that we smashed
The robberies, The jewelry, guns, the weed stash
It's usually easy for me to smell a pretender
At the family meetings he's a regular member
Deep in our circle, but I follow my intuition
And tried to warn the bosses, they thought that I was trippin'
Told the guard to pat him down, I fear he's a liar

Even having unprotected sex with a coach whore
Hip-hop till my heartbeat cease
I ain't a cash cow, but I do eat beef
Movin' in the right direction, map quest the cross streets
If you cross reference all of my efforts with perfection
You'll see I pole vaulted like an election
Over the bar ya'll raised, or the standard ya'll set
Never with the extras, on or off set
It's a rap, not a lecture, you ain't gotta pay attention
But I'm a music soul child, please just listen
And my mother ain't the virgin Mary
But I'm so religious with the lyrics I'm a Christian
On the verge of crucifixion, Non dash fiction
You lower class livin' with your poor performance
You're bringing the house down, fuck a mortgage
Fuck a chain, I'm a free man, first name Morgan

She start beef and I'm just catching a flight
It's probably drugs if I'm sipping the Sprite

Drink, smoke, roll some dice
Shoot the club up on open night
Hit a bitch in a wig, tall nigga got caught on the leg

I'm probably getting top in the staircase
Fiends take a bump and can't stand straight
Yea, I'm a firm believer in god

It make a nigga wanna get up and rob
Wasn't for me a lot of niggas will starve
They needed work so i give 'em a job
Feed your peoples nigga
A lot of niggas don't share them views
So the TV gotta share that news
You know the streets in these made up rules
Cause niggas ain't pay them dues
They show a tarp and some beat up shoes
Shit is wicked, and most of these niggas is duck
Plus keep it tucked or you pressing your luck
You know the peeps get to searching the truck
They smell weed, now they bringin' the dogs
Run up your name thirst to give you a charge

The only thing better than sex is when the words connect
I'm a pisces with a chicken fishnets, difficult to catch
It's pivotal to know that Soul don't play round'
You got wordplay, i got word playgrounds
I make sounds do tricks and flips
I had a tech deck before we needed a tec on deck
We never can be neck to neck, the naked truth is you suck
I'm just worried but who imma get the neck from next
Next level reason and rhyme, one word at the time

You at the Podium, we throwin' tomatoes at your show
Ayo, is a tomatoe a fruit or a vegetable , I don't know
But I beat up every beat i put my heart to
And I made it all of making cartoons
I'm only getting started , the flow is so retarded
I could get away with murder fingerprints up on the burner
No I ain't got no wallet but ....
Running through them racks and we shot for the designer
Last year the first year a nigga ever paid taxes
In Manhattan with a model catchin' all my taxes
Hold up, wait a minute; y'all thought i was finished

Now we really in it, 50 for the ticket

I pay it no mind, I just stack up my cake
Don't know how to fail, homie that ain't my thing
But better believe I'mma get to my dream


Lil' nigga with a dream like Dr. King
I want the fancy cars, I wanna rock the bling
I want the pretty girls, I want the big house
I want my momma living somewhere far way out
I want my going to school with the whities
I want a sneaker deal, somebody call Nike
I wanna shoot movies, somebody call Spike Lee
This for the kids in the ghetto just like me
If you want it then get it, you gotta work for it
I wouldn't want it if I didn't have to work for it
So I grind and I push then I push some more
I ain't in but I'm right at the front door
You know you close when the haters start hating
You know you close when the real start faking
I keep a law first and I go hard
I came from nothing, it's only right I show off",https://genius.com/Ab-soul-dreamin-lyrics

I feel like I know my sole purpose
Colder than a winter solstice
You're a dope dealer if you sold this
Sold everywhere if you ain't know this
Solar power, solar system, told you so
You was a compartment in your car, you couldn't con soul
Known to consolidate hopin' those who listening
Nothing but facts and tracks I'm soliciting
Soul train, soul plane, those are no brainers
Soul so thick, to defeat me would be amazing
A day and a half of these eight and a halves
Solidify why I'm the greatest to rap
Yo, yo, yo
Top Dawg soldier, hoes call me Soulo
I left America with a bottle of Soul Glo
So everywhere Soul go, Soul gon' shine

Lifestyle,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Aye............This thing on??
Yeah, what's going on y'all??
Once again.........Soul!
Just want to give you a piece of how I'm living

Lets talk about my lifestyle, 
I'm broke but almost famous how can I explain this?
I'm so close but yet so far,
 
they say I'mma a star but that ain't quite my lifestlye
I'm broke but almost famous how should I explain this?
I'm so low thats why I get high, and that ain't a lie, it's just my lifestyle

Fresh off the L.A.X tour no pay,
 
no per diem,
 no shutting down stores
Hype manning for Jay Rock yeah it was fun of course, but the set was too short
To perform one of my songs,
 
I reaped a few benefits and met some important people
That if people see you with they gonna' want to meet you
We torn down stages, got groupie love, got high, stupid drunk, even scuffled in the club
I made it back in one piece thank the man above
Hadn't come to grips with niggas thinking I'm a blood
It's over when your neighborhood is full of crips
Luckily for me they shoes tied and niggas never trip
Scrapped up enough change to pay my phone bill
I got a past due balance but it's owed still
That's the shit I write about I swear I'm so real

Lets talk about my lifestyle, 
I'm broke but almost famous how can I explain this?
I'm so close but yet so far,
 
they say I'mma a star but that ain't quite my lifestlye
I'm broke but almost famous how should I explain this?
I'm so low thats why I get high, and that ain't a lie, it's just my lifestyle

Chyeah, Soul!
Roll us a swisher up, lets get high
My mind right, im focused now
I know the trials, and tribulations
I ran wild, threw on an apron
Dishing birds out, imagine a boston market in a nickerson gardens
You ever seen a blood bargain?
Got fed and saw them Feds often
I never sleep you do that in coffins
Now, I can recall being down to my last straw
Thirsty for a burglar gun in my draws
Now I step on stage, people applaud
That alone should show you hard work pays off
My daughter is my world thats a blessing from god
And even when she cries I see myself in her eyes
For her I got to provide, till my demise, shit even if I died I'd probably come back to life
Nothings gonna stop me

Lets talk about my lifestyle, 
I'm broke but almost famous how can I explain this?
I'm so close but yet so far,
 
they say I'mma a star but that ain't quite my lifestlye
I'm broke but almost famous how should I explain this?
I'm so low thats why I get high, and that ain't a lie, it's just my lifestyle

The homie hit me said he seen me on B.E.T
Like whats the deal with that??
You getting big homie, I use that type of shit as motovation
Which is important as a lawyers opening statement
If I bet a dollar bill my flow is worth a fortune
Would that mean I was cheap or that I can't support it
Some people see me as an icon, half of them show me
They got me in their iPod(good looking.........yeah)
But still my stories more relateable cause real is relative
As you and yo' momma's kids
An no I ain't as big as drake, but I'm capable
An I may not smoke an ounce but an eigth will do
An I promise you're safe where I'm taking you
On a journey through a day in my shoes
Where everybody thinks you're some kind of celebrity
But you can't even take your girl out for some food
Many would argue that i made a lot of wrong moves
But i stand behind myself like a shadow, when I'm in
A certain position under the moon, just think it all
Started from a text battle
What up D.Cash my nigga novik to, snake hollywood
I got it my nigga, swear to god 
I'm a phrophet like Elijah my nigga
And ain't nothing gonna stop it my nigga

Lets talk about my lifestyle, 
I'm broke but almost famous how can I explain this?
I'm so close but yet so far,

Anything,UnKnown,UnKnown,"You've been my man since I don't know when
When I was new to the hood, you broke me in, and I'll never forget
You never followed the reg, you'd rather follow your head
Even when I chose another route you held me down
Your house is the spot, your moms is the best
Took us to and from to the mall and the party on request
Never stayed low key, you was the loud type, do it now type
They shoot at us, we gotta shoot 'em down type, better believe in honesty
You found a wallet on the floor, yeah you kept the dollars
But took the rest to the lost and found, always considerate
That's why you'll always be my nigga, Chris
They call you Rocky but I call you Capital
You keep it real with me, not cause you want to, because you have to
Me and my boys gettin' money international
The guy I can always rely on
I would give you my right arm if you asked, coz on the real

I'll be your boy 'til I pass and go on, cause I would die in your honor
That's on my momma, I'd do anything for you
There ain't a task too large for my dogs, barefoot through the frost
I swear to God I'd do anything for you
You ever need it, make the call and I'm on it, mission accomplished
I promise, my word is bond, I'd do anything for you
When comes to shove I'm right there by your side, down for whatever
Whenever, cause on the real, I'd do anything for you

My best friend, you'll probably be my best man
Always overprotective of me, and out for my wellbeing
We wrote our first verses together
Who would of thought that we'd both be in this for cheddar
Remember when I hit you in your throat that time we was going ?
It felt good, don't tell nobody
Because you were always stronger
Wish we could go back to those junior highschool hallways longer
Me, you and Chris up to mischief
My nigga lying about, girls that we fucked back in the days
Laughing away, ?
Former john cuffs, ?, shift shirt
And your ? was whack, but you still came exact
When I heard your fathers car blown up
I swear to god that my heart froze up
Deepest apology, Rest In Peace JT
I got your son, I'll make that pact with you
Till God send him back with you


You changed my life really, ? my down to earth mommy
Open my eyes to so many things
To the table you had, plenty to bring
Taught me about hip-hop and it's flaws
The bottle popping and whores, don't really mean much
Corporate Americas in hysterics when they see us
The game really needs a clean up crew
Had me looking into history, dug deep in my soul til' I found my identity
The real me, your moms took me in, when moms put me out
Offered me change, thats out of love, or she's awfully strange
Wanted to be your man, man, you ain't see it happening
I got the message, got with Lori, now you stressing
Cause you worried that, imma leave you all alone
I never left, I'm calling you frantic, trying to salvage whatever's left
I hope we still good and you ain't just saying it, I pray to this

Can you hear it?
This type of shit pulsate my spirit
This ain't pass interference
This is past interference
X men out like an action series
Hold on, mama I'm looking for some night cap, come
But I ain't playing no games I mean business
And every boss need a assistance
So is there anything you can assist with?
I need to know, like a yes man tryna let it go
I'm so professional, and I'm cold with it
Feeling a simile with eskimo
I been on point, it just don't equate with my decimals
Breaking down a swisher in a suite with a vista view
Rollin' up the vegetable
Friends looking at me like, ""what's gotten into you?""
I'm looking back at em like, ""life""
Same dudes who never gave a fuck about a kid
Now they want a feature cause they presentation weaker
Best thing making noise since the motherfuckin' speaker

That's the sound right there

Open your ears
Fill you in on what's been going on over the years
Before I had the cue to go to the studio
I was on the desktop mic making music yo
No engineer, no EQ
Just a old Lox instrumental with a weak loop
Sorry if you out the loop
You should try a hula hoop
Steppin' to the mic after me is a death wish
Blow the candle of your career out, don't test this
I'm off the kush, why stress this?
Been used to getting criticism from skeptics
Now I can write a song full of flaws better than your whole catalog
Just playin' with it, need a analog, I'm saying nigga
I'm Santa Claus, slaying niggas
Cookin' up, souffle-ing niggas
I would say food for thought
But y'all ain't got taste, why waste it for?
I'm ready now they saying, ""wait some more""
Chalking niggas up and erasing your boards
I'm in the Mitsubishi cause I couldn't afford
That's the sound right there, must have came from the Lord
God MC, yea
I'm just putting Los Angeles on
I only wear a fitted cause my halo is gone
Born center of attention, listen up
Like a eardrum on the tenth floor, goin' up!

Yea, I wasn't born here, was dropped out of the air
Was fourth wheel, now I'm the heir
Before I made music it was musical chairs
Before I laid tracks I was wrapping du-rags around my hair
Lines on my forehead, I ain't care
Just wanted the bitches to know I was there
You niggas going through a identity crisis
Pumpin yourself up, you caught similar ices
You niggas wack, what's your life like
I already left man, y'all don't even write right
I'll put you to rest fam, night night

Up the street, I proceed to investigate
Lord know I wanna penetrate, and I can’t wait
Damn shame, from here I can’t even see her damn face
I’m outside, smokin’ a black, she hopped in a car
And drove closer to where I was at
I was are, without hesitation I flagged her down
A military casket, she drove right past me
It kinda hurt ‘til she threw it in reverse
Said, “That ain’t the way you greet a lady in the street jerk!”
I’m like, “My mistake, how’s ya day goin’?”
Knowin’ I’m envisionin’ her nipples through her t-shirt
She said, “It’s goin’ good, how’s yours?”
I said, ""It would be goin’ beautiful if I was yours""
""Now quit the bullshit, I’ve heard it all before
My eyes are up here, they ain’t in my bra boy""
I chuckled a little bit, she chuckled a little bit
I said, ""What you finna do?"" She said, ""None of ya business""

And whatever Coca-Cola want, Coca-Cola havin' it
Coca-Cola wanna go to Angola with her Aunt Rosa
Guess what? I’ma have to make it happen (Why?)
Cause not only does Coca-Cola resemble a Coca-Cola bottle
And shit, she probably could fit
A whole Coca-Cola bottle where she swallow and shit
And then swallow the shit, ‘til the whole Coca-Cola bottle
Turn hollow, she won’t leave a drop of that shit (Thirsty)
White kids in Ghana and shit
I should tell you Coca-Cola’s a dime
In 1950, Coca-Cola was a dime
And we all know things get better with time
What you think she hit for 60 years down the line?
Never mind, Coca-Cola only thing on mine
I hope she succeeds but I wanna see her behind
And Coca-Cola so bad, I’m dippin in my lil’ stash
Trickin’ up the ass, trippin’

In one of my other lives, I had a Ph.D
I’ll tell you ‘bout the patient that stood out the most to me
Imagine Pamela Anderson-Lee but naturally
Big booty, suitably named Judy
She told my nurse she feelin’ sick as hell
My nurse took her temperature, she still couldn’t tell
No sign of cold, no fever, so she don’t believe her
Told her wait in line, be  for me to see her
I called her in, told her thrown on a gown
And make yourself comfortable, go ahead and lay down
I gave her courtesy, walked out, came back in
Put the stethoscope to her, didn’t hear nothing wild
Okay, I’ma need you to open your mouth wide
You familiar with Trey Songz, right? Yeah, say ahh
Hmm, there’s nothing wrong in here
I’m startin’ to strongly question why this woman is here
Ma’am, I really must ask
Is this sickness you insist really that bad?

Soon as I hit the booth it gets humid
I’m shootin’ at vanilla skies

I just wanted to come natural
Whites used to hang blacks
Now Barack hanging in the White House
Is this something that we should value?
Or is it just, somethin’ to cover up
The more corrupt, shit that’s around you?
I found a penny on the ground that read that
Things don’t ever change over Abraham’s brain
And I know it sounds strange but there’s a kid right now
Savin’ up to get a Range and a couple gold chains
Before a place to stay, priorities gone astray
Like a child without an owner or bullet without a name

Only messing with niggas with leather seats
Lead tiny rims and big sub woofers that beat
Down the block

Tiffany watch blinded my eyes even through shades
Having me hiding mine from the swap meet like an Easter egg
We got close she scooped me to the game she played like P.E
Niggas copped her anything that she pleased
I couldn't knock her shit I was trying to take her down myself
Plenty nights staring at her pictures feeling myself that's too much description
But I will tell you bout this one incident
She asked a nigga to sell her his soul then he froze , then he considered it
And that's some cold shit cause she so hot it just don't make sense
I hear the beez buzzing and the birds chirping when I'm wit her blurry vision couldn't see she was a blunt everybody hit it at least once
I won't acquit her till she fuck me over
I heard she got the virus too but she say she cool
She specialize in terrorizing whole crews
With the lust demons she posses
Prada bags full of broke condoms and contracts
Signed over the vagina
That read
Easy access and its never denied
A devil in disguise
With ulterior motives to rise
While you fall shorter than a dwarf cut at the thighs
