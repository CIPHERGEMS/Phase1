I've been trapped in my mind, girl, just holding on

I'm in pain, wanna put ten shots in my brain
I've been trippin' 'bout some things, can't change
Suicidal, same time I'm tame
Picture this, in bed, get a phone call
Girl that you fucked with killed herself
That was this summer when nobody helped
And ever since then, man, I hate myself
Wanna fuckin' end it, pessimistic
All wanna see me with no pot to piss in
But niggas been excited 'bout the grave I'm diggin'
Havin' conversations 'bout my haste decisions
Fuckin' sickenin'; at the same time
Memories surface through the grapevine
'Bout my uncle playin' with a slip knot
Post-traumatic stress got me fucked up
Been fucked up since the couple months they had a nigga locked up

I'll be feelin' pain, I'll be feelin' pain just to hold on
And I don't feel the same, I'm so numb
I'll be feelin' pain, I'll be feelin' pain just to hold on

And I'm always where the
Sun don't shine

Won't hurt me now 'cause heart's been broke
I hate myself, but it won't show

And it's 10 for the wolf and three for the shepherd
And it's one for the sheep who led by your leopard
Often gave his perception as a handle of weapon
Took a bite of your apple, give me all you can offer
Now I'm trapped in a changing maze, setting my soul ablaze
Couldn't control the pace, where is this going?
Hey, heartless is recklessness

it's word of a pacifist
To word of a masochist, I'm off of the map
My Lord, I spoke to a Baphomet, he said he would save me
If I gave him one thing he needed, ""What is this thing?"", I pleaded
Boy, it's the key to even

Taken aback, he smiles and tells me

You ever seen a nigga hung with a gold chain?
I'd rather sing about the same things that we claim
Such is bashful, but niggas like a task force
Mobbin' on the streets and robbin' stores in ski masks, bruh
Niggas ask for peace in a riot, then bring violence
'Cause it's a game of cat and mouse and you gon' bleed silent
What's the justice in sayin', ""Fuck it,"" and grab the pump?
Then kill a woman with many children? Makes you a chump
Look in all the stores you wreckin', nigga, I reckon
Think about the people who own it for 'bout a second
I know you got your problems, but brother, they got theirs
This is not a game, quit violence and grow a pair
But sure, you'd rather hear me say, ""Fuck the black prejudice
Let's murder different races, grow hatred, and form irrelevant
Views, and etcetera, knives thrown
Damage 'em, lives blown, oblivion, all cold, oblivious
I won't dare say that you should stop the fuckin' ignorance
Murder opps, killin' shit, I'd enjoy the thrill of it
Bathe in blood of officers, different corpses, offin' 'em
Auction 'em, don't you bark at 'em, murder 'em, never heard of 'em
I could preach the peace but say, ""Fuck it,"" and preach the murder
'Cause this ain't fuckin' life that we livin', go 'head and grab the extension
Give death another one, uncle, cousin, brother, son
Glory to all the chosen ones that will rid you of innocence

I shot an angel with my father's rifle
I should've set it free but I...
Our Father, hallowed be thy Name
I shot an angel with my father's rifle
Thy Kingdom come
I should've set it free but I...

Hush little angel, don't say a word
Bottle full of pills, passed out on the curb
Sun brings heat and it just won't snow
Noose like a necklace on my neck, won't go
I was too slow 'cause I won't understand
Blade for your cries, count a penny for my sins
Water flies off and the lake don't stream
Wrist down the river, not across, wanna bleed

Grow your wings, fly away, fly away, fly away
You don't wanna stay, wanna stay, wanna stay
Grow your wings, fly away, fly away, fly away
You don't wanna stay, wanna stay, wanna stay

Wake up to your face
I'm straight-forward, fuck a pace
What I wanted just so happened to be you
Couldn't picture being a moment in your shoes
When I think back to the kidney failures
Broken promise, I failed
I won't deny it, I hailed the ground you walk on
Yeah
Heart stops, you walk away
You're good today, you're gone tomorrow
I carry my heart on my face, I'm so depressed
What good is sex?
I pray that you would love me less
And now it's here, hand on my chest

Grow your wings, fly away, fly away, fly away
You don't wanna stay, wanna stay, wanna stay
Grow your wings, fly away, fly away, fly away
You don't wanna stay, wanna stay, wanna stay",https://genius.com/Xxxtentacion-wingriddenangel-lyrics

The words that I find just don't seem to compare
Awaiting my death in the end
Alone, I must seek out the end to begin
So nobody wants death
'Cause nobody wants life to end
I'm the only one stressed
And the only one tired of having fake friends
Put the noose on my neck
And the hole in my back, again
I've been waiting on death with a smile on my face
So this is the end
Waste of tears
Waste of years and months
Faced my fears
Loving her for once
Hurt me
Break my heart

Can't keep love at all
Turning, twist myself
Worthless

If death is what it seems, why is it so vividly portrayed within my dreams?
The fear of understanding the Devil's running his course
Hatred's not received, it's coming straight from the source
Remorse, as this time becomes a factor, minds full of greed, exposing your benefactors
Backwards, pace backwards
, everyone is superficial
Only breaching the surface, surface upon the Earth
And flames engulf the Earth, and prized possessions, they incinerate
This is far beyond any director tried to demonstrate
See the record, here's the record, take the record, set it straight
Perplexed
, 
only receive slumber when at Heaven's gates
And this is fairly simple for your breath, try and contemplate your conversates
Hesitate and navigate your inner traits
Back to a time where minds were just matter
If you stated opinions then bones would begin to shatter
It didn't matter back then cause there was no reacting, acting up
Chevy in black, Acura
Accurate facts put the black in fact
If you thought that you are free, you should disregard that
All facts

Of telling you the truth but oh well I'm already in hell
I'm tired of havin' patience
So I'ma sell my soul and say some shit that fuckin' bothers you
Jesus wasn't white nor black, I can't knock it
Was somewhat a Arab and one hell of a prophet
Don't understand why J. Cole talkin' 'bout false prophets
But didn't mention higher-ups
Change your name to Amber Cole
These fucking entertainers is playing it by the rules
Sucking government dick for safety to stay cool

Tryna scream for hope, just a shoulder that you can lean on

While this evil fuck laugh at you
Train getting closer, you still surprised that he battered you
Tears falling harder and harder, minutes get minuscule
Could've had a son or a daughter, now what you finna do?
You finna die here on this train track
'Cause clearly after death, ain't no way you can find your way back
Thinking 'bout your previous memories, going way back
All them fucking dreams 'bout a diamond chain and a Maybach

One Minute,SKINS,2018,"So much hate at the top, it's a lonely place
When you find out the opps ain't the only snakes
And your spouse only know what you don't erase
The world only know you by your worst mistakes
So spaz on they ass, that's the only way
Smash on the gas down Stony, ayy
Crash and come back with a swollen face
And when I'm on my way, X hold the gate
Terrorize shit, we don't negotiate
If you bitch-made, we don't associate
Show up at your birthday if you owe me cake
With a black mask, that's how we exfoliate
So pardon my way, my heart's in the way
I follow my thoughts, ain't no logic in Ye
Said that's all I'ma say, if he caught him a case
Then send him to jail, like a dog in a cage
I ain't feeling the age, no rottin' away
You're dark as the days, you caught in the way
'Cause coffins is laid under a tombstone
'Cause even when you die, they still throwin' rocks at your graves
So follow the wave, can't swallow the hate
My mind trumps anything that a scholar could say
Don't know how to behave, we rage out of the raves
Dislocate an arm, just pop it in place
'Cause the damned, they ain't it, all the pain and anguish
Turned me into a man, so I ain't complainin'
Now these things is changin', no more lames is hanging
No more fame in famous, ain't no shame in shamin'
She wanna give you the cookie, you Famous Amos
She gave you the pussy, but you ain't pay for the anus
Now your name is tainted, by the claims they paintin'
The defendant is guilty, no one blames the plaintiff
Gotta say it in Layman's terms, while you wait on arraignments
'Cause if the jury say you did it, the payment is heinous
Give me one minute, my lady just fainted
My babies is crying, you understand what I'm sayin'?

One minute, one minute, gone
One minute, and the next one's mine
One minute, one minute, gone

Luke White on the beat

You ever seen a nigga hung with a gold chain?
I'd rather sing about the same things that we claim
Such is bashful, but niggas like the task force
Mobbin' on the streets and robbin' stores in ski masks, bruh
Niggas ask for peace in a riot and bring violence
'Cause it's a game of cat and mouse and you gon' bleed silent
What's the justice in sayin' fuck it and grab the pump?
Then kill a woman of many children makes you a chump
Look at all the stores you wreckin', nigga I reckon
Think about the people who own it for about a second
I know you got your problems, but brother, they got theirs
This is not a game, quit violence and grow a pair
But yo, you'd rather hear me say, ""Fuck black prejudice!""
""Let's murder different races, grow hatred and form irrelevant!""
Views and etcetera, knives thrown
Damage 'em, lives blown, oblivion hole cold, oblivious
I won't dare say that you should stop the fuckin' ignorance
Murder ops, killin' shit, I'd enjoy the thrill of it
Bath in blood of officers', different corpses, offin' 'em, Auction 'em, don't you bark at 'em
Murder 'em, never heard of 'em
I could preach the peace but say ""fuck it"" and preach the murder
'Cause this ain't fuckin' life that we livin'
Go ahead and grab the extension
Grab another one: uncle, cousin, brother, son
Glory to all the chosen ones that will rid you of the innocence
But in a sense, innocent will soon behold the ignorance
Blasphemous, killin' our own, murderin' black

Equity and equality: the end result we all  the ones that don't want to live in misery, that is  desire.  And naturally we all black and white are schadenfreude or malicious. Here are a few examples
Emmett Till, August 28th, 1955, Mississippi  pulled out of his house in the middle of the night, in front of his mother who had to watch her son be taken from her on the sidelines, for little to no reason at all worth murdering a fourteen-year-old boy.  Castrated, mutilated, but also documented for the years to see
Kori Ali Muhammad, black-on-white. Philando Castile, white-on-black.  Now these things never come to or remotely remain in the public eye. And the youth is never inspired to take a stand to make a difference. So I will speak for them. The youth, that is, the ones full of innocence. The ones inspired by the things around them, to matter
I can go on forever about the fact that murder is murder whether you're black or white. You should always feel free to voice your opinion, but to act out on these irrational thoughts in every shape or form is disgusting. You cannot, as black or white, call yourself the supreme race when moved out of your comfort by the opposition's color, their skin color.  That is no form of being or demonstrating being a supreme being
If you are a supremacist, be unmoved by the opposition. Remain unscathed in the comfort of your own home, in your own realm. Demonstrate care for the youth's future, white or black, black or white. Are you willing to risk your child's future due to your own bigotry? The choice is yours, but your child will not stand for the hate.

(I thought you got all you came for)
Thought I lost my mind
With the pastor preachin', or the picture paintin'
With a heart embracin'
Ever since, from the Southside
Sorted out in a archive, for the black price, suitcase and a black tie
How profound, I find it funny
No explainin' how I lost my self
But I'm chillin' in the bookshelf
With a pocket knife, slit your wrist with your act to right
Such is life
Ecstacy, slit wrist, and a vagabond
Vagabond, vagabond, you're my ecstasy

Ah-ah
Are you tasting me?
But I miss you and I hate you
Ah-ah
But I need you, and I love you more
Every minute
Ah-ah
In January, and December, I want you
Ah-ah
You're my ecstasy

Shut it down, going to take you outside (Oh)
Sifting up a reason from the lonely dirt (Woah, woah, woah)
When its over, youll be golden (Woah, woah, woah)
Over, over (Over, over, over)
Shut it down, going to take you outside (Woah, woah, woah)
Sucking up the dust from your static crown (Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God)
Oh, just to turn away, and you'll be golden (Hello, hello)
Over, over (Woah, What? What?)

I think you got all you came for
But do you want more?
Easy is overdone, overdone
Is it gonna be right this time?
Is it gonna be golden?
Is it gonna be right this time? (Right, right, right, oh)

Push drugs in my pocket
I'ma pull it out and then pop it
I'm a common case of a ganja blaze
And my mind is fading quite frankly (Oh)
It's a tricky course, never that way
Give my mind a question
What kind of sorcery is this?
Dark night and a night eclipse

Lacy, Lacy, Lacy
One more request
Release my pain (Ha)

Did you think you got all that you came for?
Lover, lover
Easy is the way you free fall
Into the lap of inertia
I think you got all you came for
But do you want more?
Easy is overdone, overdone
Easy is the way you free fall
Into the lap of inertia
Easy is the way you free fall
Into the lap of inertia

Easy is overdone, overdone
Easy is overdone, overdone
Easy is overdone, overdone
Easy is overdone, overdone",https://genius.com/Xxxtentacion-ecstasy-lyrics
Introduction (instructions),? (Question Mark),2018,"To find, to find the exact words, to find the perfect words, to say less, but to say more, was ideal with this project, and 'til my energy and mind be felt, in a less aggressive way, but a more passive and genius way was ideal with this album, to show the versatility and to show the open- to open minds in itself was the goal of this album, and to acquire a large amount of passion, and love and appreciation for myself was the goal of this album; loyalty to myself was the goal of this album. 
So, I'll offer this warning and set of instructions; if you are not open-minded before you listen to this album, open your mind. If you don't listen to the alternative sound and you've never been into the alternative sound and have not been open to trying different things; open your mind before you listen to this album.
 You can listen to it anywhere, preferably your room, your car, but it can be played anywhere. This album is far different, far more versatile, far more uplifting than the last. 
It's something you can find comfort in, it's very comforting, but discomforting at the same time

So, with this project, again, you're entering my mind,
 feeling my insanity, feeling my, my genius, my energy. Enjoy",https://genius.com/Xxxtentacion-introduction-instructions-lyrics

He showin' signs of corruption
Then went from somethin' to nothin'
He put his hands on his mother
And now he's fuckin' his cousin
Now she's havin' his baby
The bitch is driving him crazy
The motherfucker was violent
'Cause he was fresh out the Navy
She dealt with constant abuse
Never revealing the truth
She kept the feelings concealed
Until they rose to the roof
A war starts, heart drop, 'cause she was tied to the bed
Just as she thought it was over, he put a gun to her head
But listen

All my life, I dreamed these things
Seems surreal that I see these things
Until I D-I-E, all you niggas just P-I-E
Nah nigga can't sleep on me, ah ah

Until I D-I-E, all you niggas just P-I-E
Nah nigga can't sleep on me

Sleep with a knife by your bed
So convinced she got a gun to her head
Only relief is when she's taking the meds
Or taking Henny instead
Taking liquor to her belly in bed
Until her belly is red
Now she's findin' out the baby is dead
She don't wanna live this life no more
But she's stuck because she got no cure
And she want more
She don't wanna live this life no more
But she's stuck because she got no cure

About a quarter to noon
He started roaming these streets
Left her tied back home
Her mouth was covered with sheets
He started making observations from starting up conversations
Pill pop, left himself with no options
'Cause his mind is made and he keeps counting his days
Rather than smoking, the nigga simply going insane
Tying himself to a bridge as it began to occur
Fucker couldn't breathe, his sight had even went to a blur
Guess it's the drugs that made the nigga absurd
Thin-thin-thinking 'bout the past and all the things that he learned
But then it came to a turn
Started thinking evil thoughts in the burn

Ayy
Cocaine

Two shots for me and fucking Jesus himself
Who the fuck signed the petition giving Jesus the belt?
Tie it around his neck and get to fucking buckling up
For every moment I counted on him, I'm fucking him up
Torture victims are due to scriptures, it's written as such
So every moment my uncle suffered was planned in the cut
Cut his tongue out and hammered fucking nails in his skull
Couldn't see what Jesus planned, my vision is dull, and so
If there's a fucking God, I wanna slit his fucking throat
And feed his organs to the children
And, shower solutions to the black and the white
And, endless indulgence to the youth in the night
Cold scripture all use to be causing a rut
Drowning women and many children and pillaging trust
Just the minimum, murdered many in sake of themself
He just replaced you, you are just a book on his shelf, and so

Who the fuck is God?
Who the fuck is God?
I said, who the fuck is God?
Is he a trap star or rockstar
Or the president
Doesn't leave many men, innocent (Yah)

Fuck Jehova
It's Sully the Chief God
Hold up, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Society is a parasite that darkens the soul
Keeping us ignorant and under control
Our heart's growing colder as our ego takes over
Drugs numb the pain that I carry on my shoulder
Smoking all this weed hoping that God forgives me
While I stand and refuse to bow down on my knees
Bow down on my knees
Fuck that, smoke that DMT

You never seen the shit I seen
Pullin' up in beams smoke by the steam
Once had hood dreams all about the cream
Then you with the team, servin' up the fiends

You can take some of your lyrics as, you know, you'll understand when I'm dead. I mean, these disturbed kids can take these lyrics and say, ""You know when I'm dead, everybody's going to know me.""
Well, I think that's a very valid point, and I think that, um... that's a reflection of a not necessarily this program, but of television in general. If you die and enough people are watching, then you become a martyr, you become a hero, you become well-known.  So when you have things like Columbine and you have these kids that are angry and they have something to say and no one's listening, the media sends a message that if you do something loud enough and it gets our attention, then you will be famous for it.

You have little time left 'till you're gone (Whoo!)

Her body's not to be in sight (Whoo!)
Blood down your legs, smile through the pain
Drugs always seem to tame me
Hold up, wait a minute, she gon' throw a fit
Tell me, Go home, but I'ma take her
Eat up on her, but her features honestly
The best of her is gone, I know it now
But throw it to me now, girl, you showin' out
I'll give it to ya', bitch (Whoo!), she better throw it out

??ecstasy (2014),XXX,2014,"I thought you got all you came for
Lover, lover
Kicking up doubt when it's sore
Going to be covered in dark
You came all this way for a door, watching others break it down
Now I see what you came for, lover
All or nothing aren't the same score

(I thought you got all you came for)
Thought I lost my mind
With the pastor preachin', or the picture paintin'
With a heart embracin'
Ever since, from the Southside
Sorted out in a archive, for the black price, suitcase and a black tie
How profound, I find it funny
No explainin' how I lost my self
But I'm chillin' in the bookshelf
With a pocket knife, slit your wrist with your act to right
Such is life
Ecstacy, slit wrist, and a vagabond
Vagabond, vagabond, you're my ecstasy

Oh-ho
Are you tasting me?
But I miss you and I hate you
Oh-ho
But I need you and I love you more
Every minute
Oh-ho
In January and December, I want you
Oh-ho
You're my ecstasy

Shut it down, going to take you outside (Oh, oh)
Sifting up a reason from the lonely (Whoa, whoa)
When its over youll be golden (Whoa, whoa, whoa)
Over, over (Over, over, over)
Shut it down, going to take you outside (Whoa, whoa, whoa)
Sucking up the dust from your star cheek (Oh God, oh God, oh God)
Just to turn away, and you'll be golden (Hello, hello)
Over, over (Whoa, what? What?)

I think you got all you came for
Do you want more?
Easy is overdone, overdone
Is it gonna be right this time?
Is it gonna be golden?
Is it gonna be right this time?
Right, right, right
Oh-oh
To the pills of drugs in my pocket
I'ma pull it out and then pop it
I'ma common case of a ganja blaze
And my mind is fading quite frankly (Oh)
It's made me question, never that by
Give my mind a question
What kind of sorcery is this?
Dark night and a night eclipse

Icy, icy, icy
One more request
Release my pain (Ha)

D'you think you got all you came for
Lover, lover
Easy is the way you free fall (La-la, la-la)
Into the lap of inertia
I think you got all you came for
Do you want more?

Easy is the way you free fall (La-la, La-la)

Watch the nigga slip, think he will not suffice
Make 'em idle, all to be infamous
Time becomes a fucking rival
Basically battled the devil within himself
He faced the fucking tidal wave
Hands moving all in my fucking face, I hate this place
Goddamn, disgusted by my face
I feel like a waste of damn skin because the tint that's on my face",https://genius.com/Xxxtentacion-suicidal-thoughts-lyrics

Pistol on my mothafuckin' dresser

Might fuck around and get sentenced
All that shit you talkin', all them pills you poppin'
All that smoke you flockin', never do it
Bitch niggas talkin', fuck your pussy boy
I'll never let a bitch nigga do it

Step up out my ride 'bout

XXXTENTACION Discography,UnKnown,2020,"XXXTENTACION discography is vast, ranging from 2013 to 2020. While it's not perfect, weve decided to make a list of all of XXXTENTACION's songs. Feel free to edit / annotate a song to provide more detail.

It's the revenge of your bitch
She catch attention, in dimension and shit
She got your penchant tattooed to the brim
That bitch looser than the screws in my noggin and shit
She'll take your mula, pop medulla, get to suckin' and shit
Wifin' the bitch, mistakes push brigade out of they momma
Doing her braids, living with momma for the rest of their days
Ain't seen this space, shit, a young Dracula
Fucking all the homies, bet the pussy feel spectacular
She gon' stunt in these J's and buy a thousand dollar lipstick
Ever had a motherfuckin' thousand dollar dick kiss?
Well I did
Hi, kids that she swallowed, head hollow, no brain, go insane
But she gon' stunt, in this letterman, in my letterman
In my letterman

See, haha
Hip-hop's a jungle, nah

You see my raps became subordinate
Posting portraits of flow and gin
More the note of the porridge
Than more anointed than ordain
More annoyed than an orphan
From Corbin who's off the morphine
And snorting some block detergent, merging for common purpose
They notice that I was soaking in lotion
Running the motion, devotion was not a notion
Hoping that Lexi's open for fucking
Fuck it Im ducking, and trucking off to New Zealand
Im wheeling, dealing, cartwheeling
Pop pill and feeling like villain
Haha

Ah, fuck your feelings, young nigga
Ah, ah, ayy, Jah, Jah, Jah

Who blizzardous raps bigger than men of a pack, ren
To the top of the gat, rippin, I'm busting up wack niggas
Chart or a plaque, nigga, what do you choose?
Simply irrelevant, hm, cynical evident
Please, wrestling evidence
Keys moving when definite
Soul goes for the president
Bleed red for the government
Tease-

Love is not kisses, hugs, sharing fucking drugs
Pictures on your birthday, pictures of making love
Its dedication, trusting, patience and compromise
Not do or die ultimatums for you and I
I feel the vibe between us fading, I fucking hate it
I cut myself constantly, hate myself for creating
Hate within your heart, and I'm thinking this pistol tempting
Screaming out to my demons, get even within yourself
She crying, she needs your help, and you selfish
Think 'bout yourself, all these problems created
Extended from hate for self and I-

Elliott Gould: The irony is that most of the stores that were destroyed during the riots were owned by black people
Edward Furlong: That's stupid though, I mean, why trash your own neighborhood?
Elliott Gould: That's my point it's an irrational act, it's like an expression of rage by people who feel neglected and turned away by the system
Beverly D'Angelo: Exactly, I mean it's like we had in Watts or the riots in Chicago in '68
Edward Norton: It's crap, I don't buy that for a minute. Calling a riot an irrational expression of rage, that's such a copout, it's opportunism at it's worst, it's a bunch of people grabbing any excuse they can find to go and loot a store, nothing more

"?a helping hand, not a song.",UnKnown,2016,"Okay, so it's recording, it's recording now.
It's 8:31 AM and I am currently talking to my laptop and I don't exactly know how to have a conversation with my laptop while I'm by myself
So this is gonna be, um how do you call it, a try?
Um, so here we go.
So I'm pretty sure we have a lot of SoundCloud fans that actually don't have a Twitter, Tumblr, or an Instagram or anything such as that.
Cause I'm sure that a lot of you just discovered my music through SoundCloud and probably don't know how to get in contact with me.
So here's how we're gonna, here's how we're gonna keep in contact for those of you that actually, like diehard fans.
Cause I'm pretty sure a lot of our diehard fans don't have the main social networks.
So what I want you guys to do is either download Tumblr, Twitter, Instagram, or maybe even Snapchat.
And I'm gonna give you each of my names and I'm gonna put em in the, in the description and I'm gonna put my partners' names and I'm gonna, like different, different people that I'm working with or whatever you guys want from me.
I'm gonna start answering questions through Tumblr so if you wanna get in contact with me to have a conversation, you're gonna contact me through Tumblr.
If you want to, I mean just look at what the fuck I'm thinking and have a comment on what I'm thinking, that would usually be on Twitter.
Um, Instagram obviously is just, just photos
I mean the extent to it's just a DM, I see pretty much where I check is the DM's is why I go on Instagram. So if you wanna get in contact with me, again, Instagram.
My, I'll give you contact to my manager so that way you can contact my managers easier if you have a line of business that you want to contact me for. Please only contact if it is for business.
What, I mean as far as the shows we have, what's the shows we have coming up?
We have one in West Palm, West Palm Beach on Friday with Wifisfuneral.
And then I have a, I have a show with my partner the day after and also with my partner Pollari, Kevin Pollari.
I mean if you wanna come to those shows, those are the dates.
Friday, West Palm Beach, myself and wifisfuneral.
And Saturday, I'll be attending my partner's show in, what is it, Miami?
Well, so yeah it's in Wynwood, Miami.
So what I need you guys to do is go on our social networks and follow us.
So for Twitter, my social network name would be what my artist name is on SoundCloud.
X-X-X-T-E-N-T-A-C-I-O-N
For, I'll give you Instagram, for Instagram: heroinfather, H-E-R-O-I-N-F-A-T-H-E-R
For Snapchat, theheroinfather, T-H-E-H-E-R-O-I-N-F-A-T-H-E-R
Tumblr, xxxtentacion.tumblr.com, so X-X-X-T-E-N-T-A-C-I-O-N, dot tumblr, T-U-M-B-L-R, dot com.
And, um, I'm pretty sure that'd be it.
Alright, well, on a different note, here's what I'll cover. We'll call it ""a helping hand.""
Damn, I gotta get in my feelings I guess.
For those of you that I guess feel misguided or feel, what would the word be?
A little bit not in tune with what's going on around you and you feel confused, you feel like you're just following whatever is right in front of you
Here's what I call a helping hand, here's how I'll help you do it:
With whatever you apply your attention to is which direction your life will go in.
So say for instance you see money in your life and that's what you want more of.
The more you apply your attention towards money is the more it will appear.
The more you apply your attention towards bad things in your life, the more it will appear.
The more you apply your attention, such as the good things in your life, the more it will appear.
People think that people such as DJ Khaled, or like people that are successful maybe people like Kanye.
Or these bigger artist, they see them as crazy because of what they display and that they display it so simple, but it's literally what it is.
So, the key to success would be more success. The more you apply your attention towards your success.
The more you apply your attention to the good things around you, the more you apply your attention to the things that you want in your life is the more it appears.
And that, there's no other way to actually say that, so for those of you that feel like you've been thrown into some sort of disarray.
Woah, did it pause? Oh, well no it didn't pause.
Yeah, for those of you that are kind of like lost in space in your mind, just understand that your attention is important.
Whatever you, whatever you, how do I put it?
What you want will appear if you surround yourself with it.
So if you want that brand new car, surround yourself with success, surround yourself with money so this car will eventually pop up.
There's no simpler way-holy shit.

You need to make a, need to make a SoundCloud, Teflon.

I'm not the one to give advice
Social suicide, see you on the other side
If I speak my mind, they gon' have me crucified
Gonna crucify, baby, I'm ready to die
But even if I'm gone, I'm still here, so don't fear

How does the story of XXXTENTACION end?
How is it supposed to end?
Let me tell you how is supposed to end
I live as long as I possibly can, so these kids can see it's possible, and then boom, I die either of old age or from a fuckin', or somebody murder me or some shit, fuck it

I just wanna help you see, you should run away from me
Baby, I'm a drug and I don't wanna hurt you
No, I'm not gonna hurt you, girl, not at all
I ain't gonna set you free
All you gonna get from me
Little bit of love and a little virtue
If I hurt you, I'll end it all",https://genius.com/Xxxtentacion-im-here-lyrics

So every moment my uncle suffered was planned in the cut
Cut his tongue out and hammered fucking nails in his skull
Couldn't see what Jesus planned, my vision is dull, and so

And feed his organs to the children
And, shower solutions to the black and the white
And, endless indulgence to the youth in the night

I'm recording this

Just so I have it for reference
Okay
What do you want? You know what?I?mean? This is?your video, like you can create?whatever you want
Like remember how I told you, like zoom into my eyes, then have it zoom out of the eyes and then we'll be in a different scene, we can really play on that and do like a lot of things
Well that it makes it way easier in terms of transitioning and terms of scenes
Yeah, that's what I'm saying, all the-, each scene would zoom out of my eye and zoom into my eye, like I wanna be in the-, like this is gonna be green screen, right? We're gonna have to like, have like a chair, like a chair or a couch, right? And I want everything around me to be blacked out, like remember how in that one scene where I was like-, I was like-, I was like in the, um-, in like this blue place and shit, this time I want it to be all darkness
Like a massive, big black room where there's-, you don't know where the end is?
A-, a massive, big black room and you you don't know where-, where it is, and I'm like sitting-, and I'm sitting and there's a masked man in front of me, right? And they don't show his face, but you can see-
You said a massive man?
Sorry, I'm sorry, not a masked man, a hooded man and you can-, you don't see his face, it just shows the hood and he has on like, a cloak, and he speaks to me and he says ""They do not understand you. Do you not fear? The worst enemy is yourself and yet you seem unbothered. Although you cannot pretend like you have walked through life unscathed."" And I'm gonna have him like-, I'm gonna come up with like, his dialog and come up with something crazy for him to say, and then it'll be like me within my own mind, little do they realize like, this is all like, my world, right? So it's like, I'm gonna come up with like, this whole concept of like amounting to the light that I can become, and like understand-, like, bro, the con-, the concept can be like genius
So-
And then we can jump-, then we can like jump into the scene where I could say-, where as like-, 'cause then obviously it's like ""Who am I? Someone that's afraid to let go"" and then like-, you can tie those line-, you can tie those lyrics on to like, someone that's a let-, afraid to let go of my previous self in fear that the fact of who I will truly become
Letting go of someone else, you said?
Letting go of my previous self, you know what I mean?
Yeah
Because that my-, my previous self holds like, my memories hold me to the person that I was, you understand?
Yeah
So in the same aspect, like ""Who am I? Someone that's afraid to let go"", you see how you can tie those line-, that tie-, that tie to that concept, what do you feel that's it's missing? Because if-, if it's missing anything 'cause obviously tomorrow is Friday and Saturday is very soon, um, oh-ho, Rufus is so fucking cute, bruh
Literally a little leopard
However, I do feel that there is things missing and I'm gonna have to come up with something for that and then prob'
So what you wanna do? Go to bed right now?
No, I'm not going to bed, I would like to go sit in front of my computer so I can remember exactly what I'm doing
Do you wanna go write it down or something?
Yes
Then go, go do it, are we done, should I-, should I dip?
Yes, yes-, no, you don't have to dip, I mean-
I mean if you wanna dip, yeah, then you probably
I mean, what, what else, do you think you gonna come up with anything else that's worth me staying around for?

I hear things ya know??and?talk to myself,?I try not to be crazy,?keep my composure and be strong, I am strong, but weak at the same time, if that even makes sense, the mystery behind me isnt anything cool, or exciting its depressing, its sad, Ill always be alone in my mind, with my actions, lies, motives,
Ill always lose people because Im at never ending war with myself, I lean on people to save me from myself, when in reality the only way to save me is to kill me,
my depressions comforted me for so long, Ive to some degree become fond or even used to it, I cant blame my mom , or the girls who loved me for leaving, in the end all there is, is me, its not rewarding or suprising , this character Ive become , is it even me? is this what I wanted? Im not sure,
the nightmares, sleepless nights, crazy thoughts, they all play a role, I had someone who could ease it ya know? and I made it my goal to ruin it, literally, she was so good to me, she was my heroin, or heroine I broke her, completely, but not only to ruin her, to build her, and she hung on , for so long, for so fucking long,
now Ive reached a point where I can no longer progress, Im in a pond with a canoe rather than in the ocean around me in a sailboat,
nothing excites me, nothing will give me joy for to long, only pain and sorrow is what has made me feel or comforted me,
being suicidal dosent exactly help these habits either, I had a drug stage where I would pop pills on pills, just to not feel anything at all, Id get lost, and than create a motive,
the problem now is that my motives are always surrounded with these evil intentions, Ive come to think Im literally a villain at heart,
the thing is , villains are necessary for a story to go about, but, they never find love, or comfort in reasonable motive, just the craziest the things, when im good im sad, when im bad I feel alive, but than I hate myself after,
my insanity has been feeding on me since I could walk, Id only prayed Id found someone who figured it out and had the patience to keep me, to disregard the pain and only feed me love, its selfish of me, I know, but where are you, angel, my wing ridden angel,

I feel like a god amongst the men
Cut out my eyes, feed me with lies
That I don't never have to see again
I feed the hate, I feed the truth
I give the pain to the youth

Pistol chilling on my shelf
I control my own death

Caution,  I murder the pussy, Im steady flossin'
Aw shit, I leave em corpses, I metamorphose
Im fancy, lodge your head in the window of Porsches
Call less, in intercourse, then got an abortion
Slide in the pussy with Ritalin and abort it
Laughin', I leave the masses straight gaspin'
Caskets, preachin' a murder, so light your matches
Nasty tone with a nasty poem
Pretty kitty, dirty vagabond
Tragic, sacrificing sanity for vastness
Belittling vanity, watch that nigga when we cast it
Half-wet, I leave him half-alive in the basket
And if you not a savage, succumb to the madness
