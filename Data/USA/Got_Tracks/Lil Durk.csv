These ain't no Guess jeans
I dropped out of school, I'm still good at math, but, nigga, don't test me
I played to the left, they went to the right, they tried to finesse me
Still riding 'round with that blicky, I hope they don't catch me
Police had raided our spot, so we went to the next street
Play like I'm dumb, as soon as it pop, I'm goin' retarded
He say I'm hard and he say I'm garbage, I'm rich regardless
We in Miami in the middle of the winter, and we on them jet skis
If we in Atlanta, 
I'm runnin' the 'Cat and I'm workin' the red key

I cannot mention my homies inside of my song 'cause I know they be trappin' a lot
I can't keep takin' these pills, when I'm in the trenches, they say I be cappin' a lot
I know a nigga who say he got rich off the dope, but I know he be actin' a lot
I know some niggas who said that they took down the city, but niggas be lackin' a lot
Yeah
That shit was awful, nigga had that dog food
That day they shot you, I slid on a Mongoose
You cannot come back around me, you turned your back on me, I cannot forget
The police was lyin', they say that they caught you, but nigga, they made you admit
Your name was found, you put in that work, they took your stick, you a bitch
Fuck my opps, they be on my dick, they all be mad we rich (Turn up)

Only twenty-five, livin' like a boss, ridin' 'round with a chauffeur
I don't sell drugs, still be paranoid, keep lookin' over my shoulder
Niggas lyin' like I'm stealin' swag, boy, that's my shit like I wrote it

Uh
These rappers really nice as hell
I'm a different nigga when I'm pissed off
Man, he say he gon' press up on who?
I'ma get the steel like I'm Chris Paul
Back to back suburbans, I'm a big dawg
I was in the slums servin' Fentanyl
Zombieland, junkies havin' withdrawals
I been gettin' to it, lotta missed calls
Turn it off, what the fuck is he talking 'bout?
I should slap you for sayin' he hot as me
I don't know who could fuck with me honestly
They know I'm the man, so they watchin' me
Different color bands like Monopoly
Man, he must not be usin' his head
If he thinkin' I don't keep a Glock with me
That's like suicide if you play with us
Got a better chance at the lottery
Call an ambulance when that chopper sweep
Make the crowd dance, choreography
Once I got a plan, ain't no stoppin' me
Three-car garage, million-dollar crib
With a foreign bitch ridin' on top of me
Lot of people done said I wouldn't be shit
Well, I guess they owe me an apology

These ain't no Guess jeans

Keep my gun on me to stop from dyin'

Can't feed into that bullshit ain't got the time
I know what I did boy, this life I enjoy
Why you pretend boy, this shit I live for it (Uh huh)
You was hooked on drugs, I was hooked on phonics
Signed to the street,s I ain't never go to college
Asked you for cash, you ain't never say you got it (Damn)
But I gave you my last, yeah
And I'm the same nigga since last year
I told my momma I can't go down for this case
Got the same lawyer, beat R. Kelly piss case
State's attorney want me so bad
At the time I need you bad
Told myself ain't going back
Told myself can't go like that

I get so high I put these drugs into my system
I love you with all my heart, ain't no probably
You choose your life over your son, that shit killed him
I never asked you for anything, just your honesty
How you trade on me like that? I'm your family
And she tried to chase a bag before I had to leave
But two wrongs don't make it right
Get with your dog and make it right",https://genius.com/Lil-durk-make-it-out-lyrics

Know what I'm sayin'? So, here you go

We ain't talk in a minute, so don't hit me up
And I mix my feelings with prescription drugs
When I fell to my knees, you ain't pick me up
When I was down on my back, you said I ain't rich enough
And we ain't talk about no sex 'cause you ain't get it up
And I don't want you to suck my dick 'cause you ain't spit enough
You an ungrateful lil' bitch, said I ain't spend enough
You told me you want your ass shots 'cause you ain't thick enough
I'm in the trenches with the sharks, I ain't have a heart
Some nights I ain't wanna talk, I left you in the dark
You was lurkin' on my page, you became a narc'
You was writing bitches back, that shit went too far
And I carried you on my back like I ain't have a car
You was kinda mad I hang with murderers

Then Ikey, then Booka, then it's more fun
I kick her out slick as hell, tell her, ""Store run""
I know a couple divas, that's still a secret
The bitches I made eat it, you would not believe it
This shit was never easy, I move strategic
Me and two, three singers, we had a threesome
Back to back, fuckin' back to back, off the perky
Back to back, told her all them lies, I was perfect
Always tryna run the streets deep, I was thirsty
Gotta watch my back, a lot of niggas tryna hurt me
That's why I keep my .50 and my .30
Niggas ain't on shit, they washed up, detergent
Big Backwood, sat back and burned it
I'm better, hot like a furnace, yeah

And I was broke as hell, she thought I had some shit goin'
No, I don't want your number
No, I don't want to give you mine, and no
And I'm so cocky, got a big ego
Her head so sloppy, got to take off these drawers
You ain't gotta worry 'bout me vanishing
And I'm down for the cause and the challenges
I fell out with my dawg 'bout money, it was not 'bout a bitch
But he told her I had a girl, but he told her right before I hit
She say I run my mouth 'cause I told my guys I hit
But he was with me when I seen you, I said I gotta hit
And I knew he was kinda hatin', he said I got a bitch
They DM'ed her from a fake page but it was too accurate
It was him
Edible arrangement, bring flowers
Couldn't say I cheated 'cause I was a bachelor
That pussy pancakes, my tongue a spatula
And I take Adderall so I can add it up
My first gun was a Smith & Wesson
These ain't no SI's, these VVS's
I was in them trenches, yeah I need a blessing
Couldn't get into good school, I was getting rejected
No, I don't want to meet you nowhere
No, I don't want none of your time, and no
No make-up, no inches, no lipo
And I know that you know I'm psycho
Love her perfume, bring me more shrooms
My heart got no room, I don't need no tomb
No I won't hurt you, 'cause we global
The world know you, the world know you

It's gon' be okay, okay, okay
Just don't leave, okay, okay, okay

King of Chicago man
This is not a diss

Caught a new case and shit, made me look basic
Police want names, cause I done made it
Don't fuck with my niggas, they left a nigga hanging
Free Zoo and free DD, hardbodies don't say shit
Don't be from Mubu, this rap shit is fufu
(We don't rap beef, nigga!)
Catch me on Normal, with Twin he a loose screw
(My niggas go nuts!)
These niggas is snitching, we callin' em blues clues
They telling the police, giving em loose clues
I fuck with the Migos, but I am not Capo
Sipping on purple, I'm feeling like harpo
(I'm sippin' on act!)
These niggas want war, knock meat out his taco
For that beef with our team , we shooting like porno
Shots out of Chiraq, born central city
Now I'm in LA, eating shrimp with Diddy
My daddy got booked with some books and a couple of millis
The next deal I sign is gonna be for a couple of millis
I don't rock Gucci, I just like Louis V
That swipe shit is cool, but you will not Woochie me
How you gone wife her, she just gon' do the team
You stick to the smokes and the molly, I'mma do the lean
Shout out to B.O.N., I'm talking 'bout Bump and 'nem

But I seen a couple niggas I cannot mug again
Shout out to Def Jam, No I.D. 'nem
Homicide on the scene, no I.D. him

Sipping on lean, my IV Kit

Call up Randy Boy, po' lean in my cup
I call up Ikey Mikey, he shooting shit up
They talkin' bout Durk, he picking shit up
Fuck all that eating shit, I'm with this beef shit
I use a lot of autotune, but I'm with this street shit
(Ask all the opps!)
I bang like Chop, but I'm on my Keef shit
(I'm fuckin' with him right now!)
Take a nigga down, but we will not keep shit
Shout out to 4-6, shout out to Dog Pound
Shout out to 300, they will not make a sound
Niggas be tweaking, I know they 'gone hate us now
If Kobe leave league, there ain't no Lakers now
Take me out of Chiraq, like Jordan off the Bulls
How you the king of Chiraq you ain't got no pull
And these niggas throwing L's like these niggas loyal (These niggas ain't loyal at all!)

Fuckin' all these hoes state to state, I ain't see love comin'
Slowed down on that mud, grew a pudge from it, uh

You can think about the money, but it's how you gonna chase it
They freed a couple killers, now they city goin' up
And you only call me when you see me pourin' up
And you snuck n' told, you don't know if we know or not
And you brought me drinks, only time you threw a shot (Wow)

That my other homie other homie tryna kill him

Can't fuck with you I'm honest
Locked in that cell my first son I ain't get to see him potty
I'm off them drugs when I get mad I say I'm goin' Scottie
Take off them Gucci's in the trenches I wear Foamposites
Lawyer fees and bond money, I drop big deposits

Your son is evil, they think they equal

Gotta ride around my city
Can't let them get me, ridin' around with my .50
30 percs got me dizzy
Got my gun and got one on top
Keep niggas in my business, ain't no rules in the trenches

All that just be annoyin' folk
If you can't be, ay if you can't be yourself folk, make your own decisions folk I'm cool

Chicago niggas play with PnB, but ain't no matchup

Burglar, scammer, a murderer, I'm handsome

Stop lyin', stop tellin' niggas you gon' die for me

But I'm a baller, when I pass the ball, I yell, ""Hut""
Gotta watch them cheesy, sneaky bitches, they be stealin' nut
I talk down on the trenches' hoes, knowin' damn well I still fucked
But the money keep me insane, and I ain't know what a homie was
I was fucked up in the trenches, I ain't even know what a Rollie was
I used to look up to this nigga, but he gave his homie up
'Cause his daughter twelve years old, he gotta go do twenty-one
And I don't fuck with no fuck niggas, so these niggas don't owe me nothin'
Grown niggas act like kids, actin' like they Benjamin Button
Put my own fee down for my lawyer, that shit was twenty-one hundred
Had a deep talk with my dawg and he still wasn't comin'
With a gun or without his gun, I say he still not runnin'
And he tote his gun like 50, but he still one hundred, nigga

It's all love (Man, it's all love)
It's all love (Man, it's all love)
It's all love (Man, it's all love)
It's all love (Man, it's all love)
It's all love

It's all love, I thought it was real
He took a Percocet, wasn't all tryna pop a pill
Tryna prove a point to pop off first, he ain't your dawg for real
I gotta acknowledge that Lam' truck 'cause I had a Bonneville
I don't get mad when the guys tell me no 'cause I know my mama will
Different niggas, they rockin' Polo, I'm rockin' Tommy Hil'
Trenches niggas, they'll drop it all when it's time to kill
First time was a throw off on my backgrounds when I signed a deal
They say it's favoritism, nah, these the ones I love the most
I bought her two, three diamond chokers 'cause she love to choke
1942 with a small pill, she love the boat
Durkio, Smurkio, yeah, she love the G.O.A.T.
Yeah, I love them G locks
Got away from all them phony niggas, I had to detox
They don't even shoot at niggas no more, they love to beatbox
Walked up out your life with a pair of socks
That's two hundred, that's them G socks

It's all love (Man, it's all love)
It's all love (Man, it's all love)
It's all love (Man, it's all love)
It's all love (Man, it's all love)
It's all love (Man, it's all love)
It's all love (Man, it's all love)
It's all love (Man, it's all love)

I got my shooters they shooting, we show them niggas no mercy
From the pot to the block, from the block to the lot
I got to duck from the ops, they be too cool with the cops
See my life like a movie, I caught a case for the tooly
The judge given out ten I ain't scared I do it
So if a nigga run up on me I react with the uzi
If a nigga run up on me I react with the uzi
Son needed his daddy I still need him right now
He doing life in the Feds need that appeal right now
I catch a body I'm gone, I'm dipping right out of town
I see the scout who told he getting pelled right down
L's up to I die, blood, sweat, and some tears
Def Jam they signed me, complete my dream as a kid
Got locked up told my celly, he thinking life is a gig
Tell'em all I'm on TV MTV I'm the shit
I hit a stain on some bricks, I can't look back I'm ahead
I can't look back on this bread, I guess disease is to rare
One did and it spread where I be 64th
All that rating is dead I put a nine to his head
Lil rock snatched for attempt lawyer money I got him
If he can't hold weight he best believe I'm gonna spot'em
I can't sit in the streets and let my real niggas rotting
All black like I'm Bruce, so who think that was robbing
And they drop my advanced, I'ma cop me up six
I'ma carry a fenz and I'ma cop me a Benz
I got Tommy's and Mac's, 40 cals, Glock 10's
Momma told me you gon make it but, you can't get it in
I'm a trapper to rapper, real niggas to actors
Same people who’s fans they use to say ain't a factor
I'm on top of the city, so them rumors ain't matter
8 balls the size of baseballs in the field I'ma batter
A nigga tried to kill me dead, ops tried to wheel me in
Like the Cubs in '79 them niggas won't win again
Judge told me eye to eye PD riding on her end
Get caught with another slammer they say they first offer 10
I can't change up like a penny, I want head just like a penny
You won’t catch in the telly, catch me in back of the Bentley
Niggas know I'm nailing shit, niggas know we killing shit
I don't really give a fuck all my niggas we be in it
We be 30 deep at least 30 of us polled up
Taking risk that I hope and see my baby growing up
Russian roulette in the streets, life is all about luck
Pussy, money, weed, loyalty, trust is what a nigga lust
I'ma I'm packing like a Green Bay Packer, all white Challenger, saltine cracker
Free all of my niggas doing more than 3 calenders
Pigs snatched me up, smacked me up cause I ain't answer them
Can't snitch ain't a bone in my body say bitch
I can't switch, half them shooters ain't shooting they faking
I'm savage, my teacher always told me I ain't average

Look what they doin' to my people
Think it's funny, why they tweakin'?
They gon' snake you, they not equal
That shit with Fredo got me tweakin'
They not cryin', they just tweetin'
Ain't no time to do no grievin'
Percocet come out my pores
You don't feel that when they die 'til it happen to yours, yeah
But they got a choice
In the trenches, I done did it, I became a voice
See I ain't changed but I was goin' through changes
Pluto'd still be alive if he ain't hang with strangers
Niggas love you when you dead, that shit the strangest
Skylar and Bella my two angels
Fo'nem at your roof like a fucking reindeer
So deep inside this hellhole, it don't rain here
We love the same people, we ain't got the same tears
They don't understand me, don't think they can hear
Spread the love (we can't 'cause niggas die 'bout it)
Spread the love (this time they said I'll die 'bout it)
Spread the love (my niggas, I'll fire shots 'bout 'em)
Spread the love (too many niggas got bodied)
I'm so deep in Chicago, whoever thought I'd see France?
If I ain't have beef I think they'd be treatin' me like Chance
Old heads cannot mislead me, they know that I'm too advanced
Even though that I'm lowkey, got killers on my demand, ayy

You ever seen friends turn to snakes?
You ever seen snakes turn to friends?
I'm seein' this shit happen every day
That's where we at, know what I'm sayin'
We rap about it 'cause we got, know what I'm sayin'
I see people judgin' us, talkin' 'bout
They always talkin' 'bout guns, postin' guns
They doin' it for the money
See I came from shit, know what I'm sayin', so I do what I want
That's why 2Pac was so great, you feel me?
He spoke his mind
Nigga ain't gotta be no gangster
Everybody with me ain't no gangsters
You know what I'm sayin', everybody with me ain't no killers
Everybody with me don't get money
You know what I'm sayin', but we gon' make that shit work
We gon' put the money niggas with the money niggas
We gon' put the killers with the killers, know what I'm sayin'
And let it get treacherous for niggas, you know?

Came a long way to a mansion crib
I had roaches at my granny crib
Jumped into the streets on accident
Police snatched me up they better not ask me shit
I don't want no Quali I want some Actavis
I bet that nigga won't lack again
Remember I had them 2s for 10s
Put me on child support you better not ask for shit
On my dead body
I remember wakin' up and seeing a dead body
And I can't go back on my word that's on my dead body
Don't come to my funeral crying ova my dead body
And I ain't gon' pick you out I'm talking 'bout everybody
I remember selling weed inside some Ed Hardy's
My homie he the police he might be fed probably
That's on my dead body

You ain't never been in a shootout with yo' homie he ain't shoot back
Niggas don't try me when I'm by myself 'cause I'm too strapped
Always tryin' to fix some shit where its loose at
Couldn't get none to eat where I'm at I sold loose squares
Tryin' tell my judge my story like who cares
Can't explain the love I got in for Dahmir (for my son)
Don't come outside when it's war I think you scared
Wasn't in my life I tell my kids you dead
Know some niggas that'll snake their homies for some meds
Know some niggas that don't take care of their homies in the feds
Know some niggas that took some gunshots to the head
No reaction and scream ""gang gang"" when I'm dead
Please be greater, don't please these haters
When that Bentley paddle, like please these gators
I don't cry at wakings, I'ma grieve later
You don't believe me now, you gon' believe me later
You ain't bleeding now, you gon' bleed later
We don't buy 5s 7s, nigga we take 'em
Percocet eater, I told Rex take 'em
Ain't let money change him
I told Rex thank you

I'ma attached to my babies
They be drivin' me crazy
My three sons crazy
Make my daughters ladies
Turn these thous to millions
Goin broke prevent it
I be on my enemies
101 percentage
Don't fuck wit no sucker niggas
My life I adjusted wit it
I snake  you just to get it
Don't wanna die, keep my distance
Wonder why I keep my pistol
Had fame since we was little
Kept guns from being bullied
Cap guns to keep 'em fully
My teacher tried to push me
I need them birds like Whoopi
My bitch I love her pussy
For thirty thousand book me
They steady tryna book me
Smoke a pound of cookie
A designer junkie

I'ma survive the struggle
Forever gon' ride wit muscle

Got fame on you mean that's fame for me

And I don't talk about no weak shit, I don't touch it
Tear your hole up and your throat back when I'm bustin'
You told your friends inside your groupchat we was fuckin'
I heard your friends say that I treat you like you nothing
I'm a gangster, but I moan when you suckin'
When we fuckin', I fuck long, I don't rush it
Fuck my past, you can't hold onto nothing
When you mad, you say go'n on and fuck

I done bought you a Prada bag, said I'm proud of you
Play with my bitch and it's bada-bing, then bada-boom

Viral Moment,Just Cause Y’all Waited 2,2020.0,"(TouchofTrent be wildin' with it)

I pour an eight inside the Lam' truck, fell asleep flyin'
I thought them niggas had my back, but I'm steady seein' signs
And I can't turn my back on Boona like I ain't see him tryin'
These tears shed, whenever he dead, it's different seein' him die
Bah, get close up on 'em, you know that shit be graphic
You gotta pop out with that ratchet, you know this shit get tragic
And you can't fumble with that stick, you know this shit ain't Madden
All that shit you did in the streets, you know that shit gon' vanish
Yeah, I pop these pills, they try to read my thoughts
And you can't dig back in your past 'cause you got time you lost
And make that time up for your kids 'cause you know time ain't bought
Booka bought me a diamond cross, but he know he won't cross me
They turned they back and said they'd kill me, yeah, that's when they lost me
I put baguettie inside the Cartier 'cause I'm feelin' bossy
They feel some type of way in the county jail, I told 'em call me
I built a relationship with the real with niggas who never saw me
Yeah, I seen my chance and that's when I grabbed it
Fuck bein' a hundred, I spent a couple hundred on niggas' tablets
Lean gave me chest pains, that's when I popped the Perky tablet
I tried to get that family vibe for niggas who wasn't established
You do that shit again, what you did to bro gon' get you a casket
I did shit for niggas without them askin'
I broke pounds for niggas without them matchin'
I don't fuck with you, I'ma tell y'all nah even though I got it

Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

This shit was different, we was together like ten years ago
And I don't talk to a lotta niggas, but they still the bros
The ones I ain't talk to like that back then, know they still hoes
And some niggas try to hide they hate, but that shit still show
I never fucked on block hoes because I call 'em sisters
One hate me right now as I speak because I called her a hooker
Cut the loose ends, I cut 'em off, they try to say I'm a butcher
Bitch, you a rat, never mind, I changed my life, I'm Muslim
I talked to Chops on FaceTime, he say, ""Damn, you back smokin'""
He say, ""That back door damn near closed,"" I say, ""It's back open""
I say, ""These blocks could be back one,"" he say, ""You back hopin'""
You gotta watch them niggas you love 'cause they still backdoorin'
He ain't got no hope in beatin' his trial because he lost his motion
Bro got life, he don't know how pussy smell, that's why he fuck his lotion
I know some real niggas would lose it all for a viral moment
My dreads swing, I feel like Wayne, show me my opponent

You know, I like talkin' to the streets, like
When you say you the voice, you gotta, like, open up, like
Tell motherfuckers, like, what it is, like, you can't hold nothin' back
You gotta relate to them, relate to the poverty, you know what I'm sayin'?
Relate to the trenches
You know what I'm sayin', I can't be talkin' 'bout a Richard Mille all the time, know what I'm sayin'?
Some of the guys don't even know what the fuck a Richard Mille is
Know what I'm sayin'? You gotta relate
All angles, know what I'm sayin'?

Love Songs for the Streets 2

I got niggas who locked up who niggas lied on
These niggas shootin' at these kids, they shootin' in blindfolds
I got blood in my eyes, it ain't mine, oh
And I got niggas in the trenches who I'd die for
They got a murder that's unsolved, it got my mind gone
And foenem still'd be right here if he ain't take his mask off
Kenneka Jenkins' murder still unsolved, oh
They said I still can't do no shows in Chicago
That's why I'ma charge a hundred fifty for a concert
When I'm done with that gun, clean your palms, oh
I'd rather do 100 years than see my mom hurt
Before you say I left you hangin', get a bond, oh
I tell 'em, Nine coming home, they say I'm lying, oh
I wonder what was in his mind in that Tahoe
Off this ecstasy, I cannot sleep-ay-ay-ay
Wash this gun powder off with some bleach-ay-ay-ay
I'm Lil Durk and I be representing the trenches
Steady ready running from the Jakes, we hoppin' fences
I regret I caught that case, I had a witness
And when I'm talking to the streets I bet they listen
When I was down bad on my dick, they ain't pay attention
Man, I fell down to my knees when the law came
And I can't go like Mitch in the hallway
I'd rather go out just like Rico, snake 'em all, ay

Oh, oh-oh, ooh
I put this pain in this shit, that's why I got the streets
They gotta come see me for that pain shit, bro

Like drinking lean shit way too cold with ice
Kidnap your son got me like I'm Uncle Ice
Your ass ain't right, keep my strap like a dyke
They shot my brother, we was in it all night
They don't listen you ain't no politician
And I was broke ain't have no pot to piss in
Don't fuck with too many niggas had to keep my distance
When I do come around I swear I feel the tension
I love my cousin Iris man I swear I miss her
Her daughter look just like her I see her and kiss her
My daddy never seen my kids, only through some pictures
At the time I was fighting cases so I couldn't visit

Ain't no way that hate can overpower love (woah)
Ain't no money in the world that can buy you trust (woah)

And you told me that them niggas ain't for me, they just want my money
And I like the way you is, you ain't tryna kick it with my buddies
And I got a habit and I like that you don't judge me
And that's so fucked up that I'm glad to be a junkie
To fall in love, I say I been afraid
I'm mixin' lean with Lyrical Lemonade
And we on top, ain't no more public aid
Or callin' your boss to get another raise

Roc gotta mop, he addicted to maintenance
No barber, but bro Nem be taping

These niggas be fake, gotta watch them
I’m hot, so I know they plotting
Go broke, have lil bro rob them
That Nina my problem solver
Man down, no shells, revolver
At the top but I gotta go harder

Bullet holes same size as Ms. Parker

Get back if you ain’t gettin’ no money
YSL got me straight stuntin
I’m strapped, you tweak, I’m uppin'

Blowing that tech like a ref with a whistle

Want war, we got missiles
Squad so hungry they eating a grissle
Bitch I'm the shit, I'm allergic to tissue
We savage, not civil, get money no issue
Only the family cause niggas ain't with you
Feeling myself cause I copped a new pistol
Aiki gon' blow, Rex toting on the low
Bought a lens for the scope, guns cocked for a roach
Take 'em down for the coke, Remy got it in his coat
Pound and lean, roll the dope, these niggas don't tote

It look bad for a nigga, funeral set up, it look sad for a nigga
40 Ruger shooters, gave all that I had for a nigga
Where you from, what's your past lil nigga?
And you broke and you mad lil nigga?
Fuck a price what the tag lil nigga?
My shooters on deck playin' tag lil nigga
You can't get a pass lil nigga
Get caught, that's your ass lil nigga
You movin' too fast lil nigga
You tweak with the squad, that's your ass lil nigga
Lil nigga, lil nigga, lil nigga, lil nigga
Tweak with my squad, that's your ass lil nigga

You know I'm gettin' money, I pull up in foreigns, I jump out with shooters
He talk about robbin', we lay in his yard and bust his medula (we bustin' his head)
A million a day, when I'm in the trap I feel like Frank Lucas (I'm feelin' like him)
I iced out the Rollies, and stepped out the place, I only eat sushi
You know what I'm sippin', you know what I'm grippin' (you know what's on call)
I'm all on that, boss niggas got passes I know that they crippin' (you know what I'm crippin')
Give 'em the fork and give 'em the bowl, I know they ain't whippin' (I know they ain't in the pot)
Durk he flew in, I brought him to the trap and showed him my vision (I showed him what's up)
My shooters no clubbin' (my shooters no clubbin')
My shooters straight thuggin' (they thuggin' forreal)
Your shooters, they bluffin'
They go the feds and give 'em discussions (they give 'em discussions)
Whip it up, whip it up, baby I'm up in the bowl (I'm up in the bowl)
Back then, show money on your head, he dead on the stove (he dead on the stove)

It look bad for a nigga, funeral set up, it look sad for a nigga
40 Ruger shooters, gave all that I had for a nigga
Where you from, what's your past lil nigga?
And you broke and you mad lil nigga?
Fuck a price what the tag lil nigga?

Get caught, that's your ass lil nigga

You tweak with the squad, that's your ass lil nigga
Lil nigga, lil nigga, lil nigga, lil nigga
Tweak with my squad, that's your ass lil nigga

None of my niggas is innocent (nah)
None of my niggas is witness
I pull up, unload the extensions
Walk in the trap and see pigeons
Birds (birds)
Migos, Lil Durk, Cash Out on the curb
Skippa Da Flippa itching for body, give him the word
Bet you won't bust a move
All my niggas got choppers, they'll damage you
Bet you won't bust a move
Have a nigga floatin' in the Chattahoochee river, fool
She cook it so fancy (whip, whip)
You niggas can't stand it (ha)
When I whip it, the J's they love it
I'm cooking a brick and they call me McLuvin'
Trap or die nigga, no Jeezy,
 corporate thuggin'
All of my niggas got gas and dirty sticks all out in public
My cup is so dirty, I'm drinkin' on Ruxman (lean, lean, dirty)
You niggas is soft, lookin' like Telletub-man

It look bad for a nigga, funeral setup, I be all sad for a nigga
40 Ruger shooters, gave all that I had for a nigga
Where you from, what's your past lil nigga?
And you broke and you mad lil nigga?
Fuck a price what the tag lil nigga?

Late night sleepin' through the gunshots
Yeah, police sirens that shit everywhere
No one to blame 'cause ain't no victim there
Can't get no justice 'cause no one cares

Randy always got the weed, yeah yeah yeah
Ikey off the flats t’d, yeah yeah yeah

No tellin' what Jason and Dthang doin', they probably with thots
Can't mention none of my old homies, they party with opps

I can't tell you foe'nem name but they play with C
I'd say fuck rap and shoot a nigga dead if they play with Steve

What's crazy Baby D you think I hurt you nigga
Ain't gon' talk about my past relation but you hurt your nigga

And I gave them what they want when no one did
3 boys 2 daugthers, I love all my kids

When the whole gang had deals and we had fun

Fuck with the kings, souls, mafias, and all the cobrassss

My big bro had a block of cheese

Four-five Glock with extended wings

I still cry when I talk to OG

I tell my niggas I love them to death, that's on my dead body
I don't wanna give up my life to anybody
Think they finessing, Durk will not help 'em out
'Cause I want they ass to win and take a better route
Wish Law ain't take that fifteen, he ain't settle well
They get 'em off the street, they had to set 'em down

I notice everybody love you when you got something to give (Everybody, I'm talking everybody)
But what if I ain't have it?
Would you still be my rib? (My rib!)
If I didn't have nothing to give
What if I ain't have nothing to give?
What if I ain't have nothing to give?

My momma said I don't love nobody but codeine
Trapping like a fool 'til my pockets obese
Real copped to ten murders, on the police
Gave him twenty years, still send him money every week
I feel like, we don't work, we don't care, we don't never speak
Told my team, ""Need plaques,"" so I don't never sleep
I'm forever real, I'm from the mud, believe
Can't struggle when I'm rich, I had to go and cheat

I notice everybody love you when you got something to give (Everybody, I'm talking everybody)
But what if I ain't have it?
Would you still be my rib? (My rib!)
If I didn't have nothing to give
What if I ain't have nothing to give?
What if I ain't have nothing to give?
What if I ain't have nothing to give?
What if I ain't have nothing to give?",https://genius.com/Lil-durk-what-if-lyrics

Uh
When I made it rich, I went and bought a Bentley, bitch (Bitch)
Walk into Saks Fifth like, ""give me that and give me this"" (Gimme that)
That's your Wednesday crush, you know Lil' Fish done hit that shit, uh (Shit)
You ain't gotta tell me, I know niggas envious, uh (Hey)
Count the cash while my lil' bitch bounce her ass (Bounce that ass)
Richard Mille cost 150, that's your stash (That's your stash)
Poppin' shit on Instagram, that's your past (That's your what)
When we catch you out in traffic, just don't crash (Brr, brr, brr)
I got a bag, I'm doin' the most, you niggas lamb, I am the GOAT
They wanted gas, I'm givin' 'em smoke, jump off the jet, get on the boat
I'm in a yacht, I'm with a thot, she givin' me throat, aw, shit
Cut off the top, Rolls Royce drop, I get ghost, skrt
Pull up in a ""what the fuck was that?"", ho (That, ho)
We still throwin' supermodels off the back, bro (Back, bro)
Alley-oop my bitch to Harden, I give her back, bro (Back, bro)
And you better not send my bitch back with her back broke (Back broke, gang)

First thing on my mind when I wake up is a check
In the trenches with my slimes, they be trippin' off the X
When I'm gone off these drugs, I don't think about my ex
And I ain't know that ho for long, she asked for Audemars Piguet

Oh, you want some diamonds, you don't want no bag, you're think you're bougie, huh?
And you don't want no Fashion Nova, you want some Gucci, huh?
And when we out, I can't be seen 'cause I don't know who you fucked
And why she think she playin' me? this shit be groupie love
Oh, I think I'm bougie
Mike Amiri jeans cost me two Gs
I can't take her to the crib, go get some room keys
Oh, I think I'm bougie

Came a long way from the trenches, ridin' CTA
From the chopper to the jet, it look like GTA
And they say I won't be shit, ain't make my GPA
And I heard his ass a rat, I'm sippin' T-E-A (Oh)
I thought you was my B-O-Y, but your ass D-E-A
I used to walk with a .22 inside my Kenzo
Paperwork came back too dirty, gotta keep your head low
If he too loud and he too wild, then he get paid for (Oh)
I know some niggas that take your head off for that bankroll
Lawyer money up to my dogs, then it's case closed
Boy, you just start sippin', we sold him Karo
I popped some X, I was geekin', I DMd J. Lo (Oh)
Jimmy Kimmel in Chicago, pull up, late shows
They put Lil' Vernie in that chair, you know he ate those
Niggas jumpin' dick to dick, man, I hate those
I remember I put a dime inside a Faygo

We fell off and it was a shootout, and I think they'll murk me still
In the studio smoking exotic, comin' up with new bars

Been around with my brothers, you give me endurance, I ride with two Glocks
And I'm thinking 'bout getting insurance, tryna do me like 2Pac

Niggas low-key Chuck E. Cheese, tryna give you a case
A lot of pussies in these streets and I'll never embrace
You talking like you an OG and you can't get replaced
They wanna see your face in the casket, I told 'em leave your face
And I be thinkin' about my dawg until them Runtz gone
Until a nigga shoot that dome, it won't be much long

They ain't doing they job, they ain't serve and protectin'
Even street niggas need that love and affection
Big homies not big homies, they ain't tryna give direction
The advice they gave to me, I told them niggas they could've kept it
Could've stayed on the porch, but jumped inside the streets, I had a selection
Ain't no back and forth talkin' on the 'net, we send a message
You want the king, you want that tiger head like the nigga off of Tekken
Put blood, sweat, and tears inside of this shit, you gotta respect it
You ain't did shit for the streets, so how you gon' put a word in?
I'ma do what all I can do, but I ain't never say I was perfect
Man, that gun heavy, palms sweaty, you acting nervous
Put a hundred thousand on his head, that's two verses
The county days, I used to wake up, wash up with the Jergens
She told me three niggas she fucked, when I went in, she was a virgin
And I can't hang around no bitch niggas, I'm too allergic
An iPhone plus an iPhone, two jail calls, I merge it

The one I called my brother not my brother 'cause he told them other niggas we not brothers
I can't tell a nigga that I meant that I love him, I be lying, I don't love him
Get in my feelings when I pop all prescriptions, I take all these pills and I crush 'em
If you ain't known for having cash or that bag, they gon' treat you like you nothing

Don't be telling me 'bout your block, nigga, fuck them
You can't bring your ass around if you say fuck twin
Into it with us, kiss your kids, make sure they tucked in
Two fifties in a millennium clip, that's a buck-ten
The one you look up to a pussy, his nuts tucked in
Ain't hide the guns fast enough, the police rushed in
And since you died for your gang, you got slumped in
You pull up bleeding out that pussy, you got a sucker then
You signed your name up on that statement, you got the best font
You asked me do I love you? Mhm, I'm nonchalant
Went on the 'Gram, seen an opp died, that's when I sparked a blunt
Maybe sipped a lil' lean too, but that's not the point
A lot of money through Western Union get you a blocked account
I'm on camera, I got a case, so foenem knock 'em out
We move the same, we all as one, that's what I'm talking 'bout
I'm the same, you touch my chain, foenem chalk 'em out, yeah, yeah

The one I called my brother not my brother 'cause he told them other niggas we not brothers
I can't tell a nigga that I meant that I love him, I be lying, I don't love him

Super Powers,Lil Durk 2X,2016.0,"Yea
The vibes so crazy right now

I'm off the lean I got super powers
Dive in that pussy like scuba divers
Hop out all black like a uber driver
Wild the whole trap like wood supplies
Yo' IG Jim Carrey, you liar liar
I'm in the hoe like the other side
I got right now and I can't retire, yea

This is the shit that they ride to
This is what you drink and get high to
This is the shit these niggas don't get
They ride and I'ma ride to
When I get dressed I got super powers
What's in my cup give me super powers
Niggas tell tales, and they super silent
I'm in my zone, I got super powers
Super powers, super powers
I swear I can take over the world
Super powers, I got super powers, I got super powers
I swear I can take over the world (Let's get it!)

Bankroll like Bruce Banner, pour a 8 I need two fantas
Coke body on a pretty woman, new car police scanner
Nail a opp with only 1 hammer, bullets burn ‘em like a sun tan
Watch me whip it like the nae nae dance,                                          car feeling like it's superman
15 thousand on the back end, all black on me like I'm batman
Ain't no robbin', that's a joke man
Green light then it's go whip
That's a drill in case it's bustin'
Bad bitches wanna touch herself
She just wanna make love or somethin'
Convos 'bout where're ya from
Super powers got me high too
Made it out cause I had to
Threw the Chi like a DM
Hood love me when I slide threw
Couple hundreds on my denims
And these shoes ain't coming out
Swagger got a nigga 'bout to fly
Taking off with these super powers

This is the shit that they ride to
This is what you drink and get high to
This is the shit thse niggas don't get
They ride and I'ma ride to
When I get dressed I got super powers
What's in my cup give me super powers
Niggas tell tales, and they super silent
I'm in my zone, I got super powers
Super powers, super powers
I swear I can take over the world
Super powers, I got super powers, I got super powers
I swear I can take over the world

Xans in my water, can't feel myself
I wish I had powers just to heal myself
Remember them nights I'd kill myself
And now I got thoughts just to be the best
The labels ain't believe me, had to prove myself
Dthang you know, nigga you was there
People left who said they wouldn't
For the niggas I lost I'd take a bullet
Run up on me now I wish you pull it
OTF my empire nigga without a cookie
30 fo' a show, tell them niggas book it
I'm tired of niggas lookin' at me like a rookie
Shark in the water on the deep end
House in the hills like the Weeknd
Only like to party on the weekend
Only like real, fuck pretend
Thank God for my mother
Thank the Lord for my brothers
We gonna take on the world
So she can be my super woman
I'ma get this super money
I'ma turn up with these super powers yea yea

This is the shit that they ride to
This is what you drink and get high to
This is the shit these niggas don't get
They ride and I'ma ride to

Know that ain't he goin', he'll crack a nigga cranium
Bigger than a mob, can't be touched, titanium
Gang goin' harder, dare a nigga to come and play with us
Stripper bitches mad 'cause I fucked her friend at stadium
Bitch know she done lost her whole life 'cause she ain't stay with us
Niggas know they'll lose they whole life if they play with us
Niggas know they'll lose they life if they play with us

Niggas know they be super goofy, they can't hang with us
She live for show, I just bought Chanel because she pigeon-toed
Pinky rose, I ain't talkin' champagne but they live for sure
Old days, we was havin' shootouts up in broad day
Hallways, mamas kick us out, that was always
Street shit, streets want anyone our age
Bro was found guilty with fourteen, boy them dog days
I know a rich nigga that'll kill you for some Balmains
Last nigga, say fuck my guys, now they all dead
I done got my bitch super pregnant, got 'em all mad
My guys fuck with your guys, then it's mob ties
Met a bougie bitch, said she ain't going, I took her to Popeyes
Why lie? She ain't pull her pants down, bye-bye
Why lie? I got six kids, I'm a da-da
Ride in that McLaren, when I see 'em, I'ma drive by
And you not my family, you ain't around me, on God, God
No, no, no, no, no
When you smoking on exotic, you need top notch
Shout WorldStar, on the come up, gave me top box
No, no

Niggas know they'll lose they life if they play with us

Took my last thirty shams, I bought a gram and got back in it
Always fallin' off in the mall, flexin' for the bitches
OG Boobie, top lieutenant, look him dead in his eyes
BreadWinner homicide, and now we on the rise
Foreign car pull in, oriental headlights
Starving in the trenches, one day we'll be just fine
I was gettin' them in high school, only rule is don't lie to me
See the belt, I'm a fly shooter, send the addy, I'll fly to it
Pourin' up the lean, droppin' bracelets in the cup
All this ice, I'ma die for it
All I ever wanted was a whip and to ride Forgis
Big booty bitch lounge around while we loud blowin'
Pen bump the hip and I'ma still be around for it

He first got locked up, ain't sent money, I sent letters though
My big bro had the D-line locked, it was in a finger four
He was on that block, you know what's up, what we did for Moe
Go fuck on me then fuck my mans, I don't get these hoes
Booka said he catch that bag, he gon' get D Rose
I ain't gon' lie, I tricked off once, I bought some Jimmy Choo's
Knew I was a star, dropped that song, I got some good reviews
Ain't gon' say her name but the bitch had bust me down for Fendi boots
And that nigga you callin' your big bro, I seen him gettin' hoed
Every time we come through swaggin', they wanna be us
Bitches always put they head down like they don't see us
They in the back of the plane, seat 27, had to key us
He don't know how to work no gun, he say it jammed but it was de-cocked

Savage so 4L, he got a drum on his stick (Facts)
Come pick up your girl, we left cum on your bitch (Hah)
Niggas shot y'all whole gang, y'all niggas ain't do shit (21)
We play freeze tag with these bullets, dawg, and all y'all niggas it (On God)
[Chorus: Lil Durk & 
21 Savage

For the nigga that killed my cousin (
Straight up, straight up
), make sure he die slow (

I know a killer that's ready to shoot something, but he shoot with his eyes closed
Better watch how you speak on that OTF shit, 'cause shit, I'll die for it
I'll go against the grain for one of my niggas, shit, if I got to
If I got to (Boo-boo-boo-boom, yeah), if I got to (Yeah, pussy)

Pussy ass nigga get robbed, if I got to
Pussy ass nigga get shot, if I got to

That pussy bustin’ like a uzi
Pussy bustin’ like a

I done fell in love with all the groupies
She just want the fame and all the moolah
I’m addicted to the tattoos on her booty
And if she fuck with me then she ain’t losing
That pussy bustin’ like a uzi
That pussy bustin’ like a
That pussy bustin’ like a uzi
That pussy bustin’ like a

Wake up, roll up a decker
Rubbing on her nipples while we steady kissing
Even after sex that pussy steady dripping
I told her I’d be fuckin’ but she something different
She like I’m cocky to riches I’m ignorant
Always mind her business, don’t put two cent in it
Dress her in Dior and tell her mind her business
I take her on a trip and pay for all expenses
I don’t got no type, I like all hoes
Even in the hood with some dog hoes
But them be them bitches we don’t fall for
Talking down bitch, the one that we can call on
Like bring me the work, shawty bring me the pack
Like bring me the lean, shawty bring me the strap
Her ass is like promoters how she bring it back
She’ll drop her pants before she ever drop a dime

I just fucked your bitch in a Jacuzzi
She hop on top and ride like a Suzuki
She squirt, that pussy bustin’ like a tooly
She say she love me, bitch you gotta prove it
I’m driving while she suck me like a smoothie
You was just a groupie with a juicy booty
And I’m just thirsty
You got the type of sex to make me leave my bitch
But is you worth it?
Nah, nah nah, I was just full of them perkys
You on the dick like you surfing
Love how you twerk it, love how you work it
You want a man that’s holding your hand but I’m not that person
I’m just the type that’s gon come through, fuck, and buy you some purses
She just want the fame, she love my lifestyle
She just want her neck, wrist, and ears iced out
I done fell in love with one of my fans
She eat me for hours on them xans

I done fell in love with all the groupies
She just want the fame and all the moolah
I’m addicted to the tattoos on her booty
And if she fuck with me then she ain’t losing

I lost my family I was feelin' stranded
I seen my son he a throw a tantrum
Call a couple bitches cause I had no manners
I asked Allah can he give me guidance
Full of anger I was in out my mind and
I know this music is my soul passion
Last week I spent fifty thousand on my fashion

On red carpet feelin' like Alladin
Got a bitch from Tokyo I like her accent
Julio Jones ballin' on 'em, Madden
On top enjoy my risin'
Smokin' woods like I'm in a cabin
Goin' broke I cannot imagine
No way, how you blastin' if you plastic
Imma turn wit da cheque get my momma a new crib
I ain't talking Kodak Black Imma get a new crib
I just paid for my side bitch to get a titties filled
And she tried to suck me up for them new Fendi heels
I been in it for a long time need some new deals
I been in 4gs it for a long time need some new wheels
Percocet with the Xanax, need some new pills
Traded in that new Hellcat to see a coup wheel

Shout out Tory cuz he signed to me
I'm wit a boss bitch count them gs
Count my cheese up
Got a passport she got a Visa
It's perfect picture Mona Lisa
They didn't believe us
Hope they never need us
While the police try to discriminate us
And I got these diamonds just to please my haters
Gotta get this money gotta chase that paper
While these niggas try to assassinate us
I got a Glock and it came with lasers

I came from public houses to a mansion
I lost my family I was feelin' stranded

Money hungry, getting busy
And the stick up homies
So pick your poison

Hell yeah I hold a grudge
These niggas ain’t show no love
These niggas was nowhere to be found, I had low income
How the hell I’ma pay my bills? I had no income
I was always taught to fight, lil boy don’t ever run
My daddy got life in prison,my moms said here he come
And I was posted on that porch and he ain’t never come
Yeah that trap going crazy inside them projects homie
Got out early from the feds, lil boy don’t call my phone
I put my life on the line for niggas who in line
I used to chew on them xannies to get me through the times
I used to believe all them rumors, it took over my mind
And if I put my name on it then that shit is mine

I been running with that street vibe
I fell back off that love shit
You tryna play me for a goofy, that’s that bullshit
I be with robbers like to mug shit
I’d rather be around some niggas I can thug with
Same niggas say they ain’t switch up on me
And this Rollie face a bigger bonus
Hang with the killers homie
Money hungry, getting busy
And the stick up homies
So pick your poison",https://genius.com/Lil-durk-pick-your-poison-lyrics
Ready For ’Em,Signed to the Streets 2,2014.0,"They hate all my niggas, they hate that I'm breathing
Shoutout to my squad, ya feel me? OTF Gang

Is it true you got shooters hangin' out the roof?
I'm just tryna' to do what I spit in the booth
Free Dada & Budo, shooters on the loose
On the block earn stripes, squad full of troops
Call Zoo, he be ready every time I do
Shot clock but he ready every time to shoot
Ops route for a diss I just give 'em shots
I gotta chill cause the police posted on the block
D-Thang say we hot but it's easy to flop
I call Rod ‘cause he easy with mop
Niggas hating, just give my prop
Niggas say that I'm dumb when they see me with thot
Boy I tell 'em like, I can't get better with bitches
I’m so fed up with these snitches, smoke one for Pluto
I'mma put grass in these Swishers
And step on these pipes with my niggas, they killin' my pride
Bitches, they killin' my vibe
IG full of money but they askin' for rides
Not me, ask one of my guys
I kill for one of my guys, free bro from the drive
Remember them days I was starvin'
Empty stomach, no car, no money
These niggas be tweakin' that's why I got shooters on dummy
Let's get it!

You want bombaclad war? hm? hm?
You wanna ramp wit me?

Got Broski on point like Kyrie
Don’t fear no man that can die like me
I done dodged doin' hits
I dodged my momma told me get out the Dodge, can't sleep
I can't Ma', cause I’m in too deep
It’s to the point where my niggas only came to me
Fuck a homie cause a homie don't think like Tony
Montana cause the chopper for shorty, ohh
Lost J-Money and Tay, the shit happened I hated it
No Drake, but nigga we made it
Called Dede he ready, he slingin' impatient, got killers like Hatians
I land in Miami, call Dada, we go and take off to Lil Haiti
Got shooters on shooters that shoot to kill shooters, ain’t talkin' no navy
Sneak dissin' on the squad, we send shots at that boy and Broski be facin'
Pillowtalkin' to bitches, I see if she bad, but nigga she basic
I ain't heard 'bout niggas, and I ain't worried 'bout niggas

Intro (300 Days 300 Nights),300 Days 300 Nights,2015.0,"This is Durk
Better known on the Southside of Chicago
And throughout the midwest as Lil Durk's father
As it started out I had a life sentence
For the stool pigeon who told on me
And I been doing that time for 22 years now
Alhamdulilah by the grace of Allah
I got that blessing and won that appeal
And now I'll be out in a few years
To be with my boy, to be with my sons
To be where I'm supposed to be in life
And do the things I'm supposed to do as a father
As always, for those who in the struggle
For those who in this system
For those who in the state's system
Keep ya head, keep fighting
Cowards, rats, don't never win over real dudes
So keep ya head up soldier
And we gone keep on letting thing continue to flow
And we'll get out an do what we supposed to do as men
And hold our own
And be the fathers we supposed to be
Be the men of the community we supposed to be

Haha, I tried to get that in
Got JDR on the 1's and 2's
I want yall to follow this shit. Ya dig?
I put him in his glo, he put me in mine
You know how we do it. L's!
Got Juice in this bitch with me, Carlito

I'm just sippin' drivin' steady swervin'
Bullets catch 'em quick
Hollows burn 'em
Twitter niggas steady talkin', Murder
Call my lawyer nigga, I ain't heard it
Call my lawyer nigga, I ain't heard it
You'll make the news where I come from
Rap but you get the Blues where I come from
Shoot a tec, you on a cruise where I come from
Get killed out the blue where I come from
Because, niggas ain't keep it too real
Niggas ain't keep it too trill
That's why I got me like 2 deals
I'm tryna chase me 2 mil
Free Rondo, his bond is 2 mil
And I got money I'm chillin'
3 Children
Get money invest into buildings
My nigga we got it we 'round each other
My nigga we buildin'
Niggas be tweakin' get money
Lil nigga chill out on that killin'
The murder capital so ridiculous
I swear I was grindin' for dimes and nickels
I swore I'd never drop a dime on a nigga

Want a war? I'll never waste time on a nigga
Let's Get It! let's get it

When you wake up off them pills, that feeling terrible
The worst thing to be known is when they scared of you
And they gon' laugh right in your face when they ahead of you
And to be technical, that shit we do is federal
Holding tear backs from this life, it's so unbearable
You a copycat, that's not lean, that's Theraflu
I'ma jump from the top of my money with a parachute
And who you look up to a ho, I wouldn't dare salute
I keep taking care of my killers, they wouldn't care to shoot
I got your address from a bitch, that's for a pair of shoes
You got a text like, ""He got hit,"" that shit be scary news
They told me, ""Get up out the streets, you can go back to school""

My life hurts so bad
Thinking 'bout if you was here, what kinda life you would have
Nowadays, the way we live, we live our life on the edge
Nowadays, the way we live, you would die if you scared, uh

This life is for the ghetto
This life, this life, this life
This life is for the ghetto
This life, this life, this life

Nobody put fear in us
I put real life inside this music, they not hearing us
I know what's real, I had some real killers tearing up
I did all I can for 'em, they not sincere enough
They stopped believing me way back then, they can't cheer with us, mmm-mmm
It get treacherous, that's why they don't mention us
Why you holding onto a snitch? Just give that victim up
They can't take care us alone, that's why they cliquing up
They told me to go pop and give the trenches up
I said fuck that shit, four killers inside a Bentley truck
It would've been five, but one of them died, his soul was given up
Wish I talked to him on the last call, told him live it up

Where the love? Mmm, where the love?
You know it's tiring tryna clean blood from a rug
You know it's tiring watchin' my back and duckin' slugs
I know two robbers said they tired of sticking up

This life is for the ghetto

This life is for the ghetto

Spending plenty weeks in them trenches where shit get real, real fast
Where you get killed fast without a plan you won't last
See life you only get one
Your dad took your ass done
So live it up don't mess it up and give it up
See I lucked up don't give a fuck I'm too up
My crew up and y'all is burnt up
Shooters shoot to kill niggas
Goofies kill for names
Real hittas hit to hit
Fake niggas them niggas ain't got no aim

I do this for my family they don't understand me
No new niggas round me they don't understand me
I do this for my crew I do this shit for you they don't understand me
They don't understand me
They don't understand me
They don't understand me
They don't understand me

Lil' nigga, we used to roll with some older cats
Had macs in the trenches like shoulder straps
Shoot at me, on your head, put twenty racks
Where your money at? Why you get over stretched?
All my niggas off drugs, on stronger acts
I won't change, I'm  the same, I'm sober 
I just bought a brick and it cost a Patek
And if I say it's smoke, then they know it's stacked
My side, my side, that's Lamron
From the part of the city, they scam hard
You would sell your own momma heroin (let's get it)
The kids that you raised they’ll blam some
Ran off on the plug through a Samsung
Feds tapping all the Iphones
Goons lurking like a plies song
Get it right before you die wrong

Where I'm from it ain't safe boy it's wild
Keep a gun cuz I gotta survive

I know they gon' ride for me
I know they gon' ride for me
I know they gon' ride for me
I know they gon' ride for me
I cried out with no reply
And I can't feel you by my side

How can I not fuck with the niggas I grew up with
Damn gunner hunters every time I see 'em
Hasta la vista, nah 'cause I'm coming back
I love to rap, I love the trap
Mama tripping but she know I'm strapped
The city want me dead, money on my head
On nuski, I ain't scared, I'm going (To the crib)
No cash so I had to steal nigga
Ain't feel it was too real niggas
Even nights I wanted to kill niggas
Plenty nights I ain't even feel niggas
Always kept it hunnid like a bread
Gimme guns when I ain't had no sets
Ain't been back since
Ever since niggas on tricks, fuck 'em
The streets on fire
Gotta keep my pole on me
My old homie told on me
Keep my gold on me
They'll kill me before they rob me
But they know I ain't going homie
They know I ain't going homie

I cried out with no reply
And I can't feel you by my side
I cried out with no reply
And I can't feel you by my side

Grew up in the ghetto the hard way
Pipes in the hallway
Where youngins be turning to killers
And killing these niggas in broad day
Me? I went the smart way
Started rapping for the large cake
House on the hill
Ain't worried 'bout a deal
I'ma do it the hard way
I'ma turn up for my real niggas
And get money with my real niggas
Since I was a young nigga
They knew I was a problem
I'ma get money and keep it real
I'ma get money and keep it real
Keep it trill
Fuck a deal
Bitch, I'm paid
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Bitch, I'm paid

I just wanna keep it real for me niggas, man
Everybody get this money, man
So I'ma turn up with 'em

I was goin' through that pain alone
I was goin' through that phase alone
We all change, you say I change alone
Sleepless nights, barely changin' clothes
You know damn right you was wrong
I was tired, they didn't realize
Certain vibes, it don't feel right
Plenty nights got me traumatized
Why they lie? I do love my guys
You lookin' crazy, know the trenches raised me
I'm Durkio, but I'm Chicago JAY-Z
And I was scared how that money made me
I caught a vibe today, was lookin' crazy
Money ran low, right? Felons can't vote, right?
I can't even vote for who I believe in, shit ain't goin' right
I didn't drop a tear inside the funeral, I ain't mourn right
And I nut in all the hoes I fuck, I blame the porn site

Please don't turn away from me
I got enough on my plate tryna turn away, tryna turn away
Became the voice of the streets and my people ain't believe in me
I'm supportive of the streets and them people ain't believe in me

Quarantine what? I'm just tryna make a buck
Talkin' to my dawg, he be actin' like he stuck
Favorite gun a Glock, it slipped up, what a month
Throw it in they face every time I hold it up
Granny ain't feelin' too well
Shootout with the police, I ain't goin' to jail
How you actin' off a case, you'll know if you tell
I know a nigga from the hood, he'll serve with no scale
Watchin' Bands make a play, I seen him score in the mail
Gave him thirty-nine years, I heard him cry in the cell
Even though I'm gettin' big, I bought a MAC through my Zelle
Took a picture on my block, they think I'm back in the field

Please don't turn away from me
I got enough on my plate tryna turn away, tryna turn away
Became the voice of the streets and my people ain't believe in me

You  ever woke up out your sleep like is you gon' die in the trenches?
You ever thought it'd be your dawg when they described the witness?
I wrote a letter to authorities when they threw out the tenants
To  claim that shit that bronem claim, you know that shit a privilege
For  Pat I'll throw them tears, I remember the night they took him
I treat them hoes with a lil' respect 'cause that could be my sister
They  had gave police them guns, when they pulled up, they booked 'em
We catch an opp, he get baptized like I was never Muslim
Like wipe your nose, I love you, bro, stop fuckin' with Ashton Kutcher
Funeral home, they extorted me 'cause I be paying for bookings
Won't  send no hunchos to the county 'cause you be paying for pussy
Could've went to college, but instead I'm in this van with hoodlums

And that shit all facts
I tried to give my dawg a pound but he want all crack
Like fuck the feds, you threaten my kids, I'm gettin' 'em all whacked
I spent like ninety on a Cuban, that shit prong set
Most of them OG's get out the feds, they know they all rats, nigga
All these niggas tryna live my life, they don't know what I go through
They ain't gon' do what they supposed to

I had to get it out that mud 'cause we was pain and suffering
And we was stuck inside the hood, we mix our Percs with 'Tussin
I know a killer got in that jam, we call him David Ruffin
And they didn't even use his statement, so he sang for nothing
They had a bitch up on that case but she the lamest bustin'
I fucked her but she still showed up at court, I came for nothing
I appreciate my war scars, show me I came from nothin'
My daddy got back off that L, like who get life for hustlin'?
I'm still a voice inside the trenches, don't make me say it again
DJ played the opps inside this club, he better not play it again
See dissin' me and go OT gon' get your hood shot
I can tell the streets what I been through just off my mugshots

And that shit all facts
I tried to give my dawg a pound but he want all crack
Like fuck the feds, you threaten my kids, I'm gettin' 'em all whacked
I spent like ninety on a Cuban, that shit prong set

I don't like to brag about the shit that I done
I took good care of the streets, I'm an icon
I got snaked by some niggas, took care of my son
I ain't put that on they lawyer, they got them title
The way you wrote that statement, you a writer
Told on 'em in the station, gave 'em right up
DD did time with no lawyer, it's survival
I'ma cut your ass right off, hang with my rivals
Catch a case while you a felon, I'll say it's my gun
They got my picture in the feds, say I'm a Disciple
They say I switched up 'cause I don't believe in the Bible
First time on the head, I kept my eyes closed
Only nigga I'm scared of is John Doe
And no support 'll make your time slow
Just a real nigga without trying to

See the trenches had made us
Lil' nigga, got my weight up
Hard work and dedication
Street niggas need to pray up
Street niggas need to pray up
Street niggas need to pray up
Street niggas need to pray up
Street niggas need to pray up

It be your dog, it be your dog
That shit so crazy what happened to Law
When the streets took Baby D, it had came with a flaw
Granny asked where Nuski at, it's crushing my heart
Tryna smoke on some zaza, just pass me the tops
The reason I can't trust y'all, you talkin' to opps
That shit be strange when they say they love you
They say I changed when I got a hundred
You can't complain 'cause I been a hundred
Wartime inside the trenches, buyin' different bullets
Hop out a Cutlass right into the bushes
Run right on 'em while them niggas lookin'
Blood in my eyes, they tryna get me
I'm the most wanted in my city
I'm the most hated in my city
Gotta watch out for the niggas who gon' envy

See the trenches had made us

Locked Up,Love Songs 4 the Streets 2,2019.0,"I can't see your face, we talk through cellphone
I salute you a thousand times 'cause you ain't said nothin'
It hurt your heart when your kids keep telling you you a jailbird
You don't complain when you don't get visits 'cause you'll get mail first
You lost your guys, have your sentence and it still hurt
Please don't think about the streets, put your appeal first
Before I ever tell a lie, I give you the real first
Before I ever tell a lie, I give you the real Durk, yeah, turn up
When you was free, you had them AK
Whoever think that'd you be passing out a state tray?
And the squad was mad at Rio 'cause he ain't take 8
23 years, he surviving off of JPay
And you ain't gotta send 'em money 'cause they stay straight
Boona gotta do one more year, I know he can't wait
They steady throwing Law in the hole 'cause he got a gang case
And I be steady taking drugs to keep my pain away
I done did so much time for my gun case
Look in the mirror, all I see is my son's face
And my daughter's and my mom's face
The state came with a plea, get out of my face
You my friend, not my family, it's a difference
I know a killer who turned the city up, he snitchin'
I know you did so why you tellin' me you didn't?
But I know another killer who turned up as a witness
Would say they name but I know that ain't none of my business
You ain't tell on the gang so you say that shit ain't snitchin'
Tryna throw up my gang, county scratch it out the picture
Gave the police some guns so they can lighten up they sentence, yeah
Y'all daddy love y'all, you gon' hear them talkin' shit about me
I'm from Chicago, if you died then we didn't forget about you
Fuck with the other side, not me, you can't forget about it
I witnessed a war inside my city, they kill anybody
I know a nigga who ain't did it, but he claimed a body
Niggas got robbed from out of town who just came to party
And why you decide to play with me? My shorties insane about me
Your name ain't shit out here, I can name some people who really about it
I know Coach Ball, he coached with Holland, tried to put him through college
I started rappin', I dropped out of school, I had my first deposit
I wasn't gon' finish anyway, being honest
And I can't do no minimum wage, being honest
Free all my dawgs who locked up
Free all my partners who locked up
Free all my niggas who locked up
Free all my brothers who locked up
Free all them killers who locked up
All them real niggas who locked up

But I bet you remember, I bet you remember
Remember my name...

They never remember
I did time for a gun, that I never remember
Did time with my son been delivered
I cried tears, I couldn't show em my position
No sleep in the hallways
Me being me sipping lean with a 30 like always
Couldn't afford trues now I sleep with Versace and Balmain
Then I hit the streets with lights on
Still slept with the rats and the cockroaches
Lost niggas , I lost bitches, I lost time
But I'm back on the block though
Gang with me also but its bigger than money
Every car is vellano
They say I won't make it
Now they favor, I got 20 to play with
Grew up on Chicago South side, where you get killed if you outside
And I made it out, and I'm outside
Name hold weight like a motherfucker
And I love my niggas like blood brothers
Same niggas, same gang can't change on em
War time, no movie, but I bet that clip gon' hangover

Real street nigga, made it from the bottom
Coming up as a kid niggas gave him nothing
12 years old knew I was a problem
All I wanted was money and the fame
Cars, cribs, and bitches wouldn't name
I can't change for nothing in this world
Lord blessed me two boys and a girl
Two dead cause I lost to this world
Crossed over like Flo Rida
Only my squad they both sliding
Money and power they both riding
Caught him and him and they both sliding
Trap house, block party, niggas doing the same shit
They got nothing
And niggas try me and that Mac bust
And they remember my name...

Don't forget about me
This bigger than money, this bigger than fame
Remember everything that I did to get where I'm at

South Side of my city and I grew up where the wars at
No school but I walked with plenty books inside my book bag
Teacher say I'ma be dead in jail with my lil ass
Now she callin' me to do a show where she book at
30K for a show, take 15 for a feature
The streets are dirty bitch gotta be hungry or they'll eat you
Gave bro 21 long distance, lawyers couldn't reach it
He ain't tryna hear it though, cause he tired of niggas preachin'

And I always speak my mind, I'm so specific (So specific)
I see this brother shit we doin', this shit ain't workin' (Shit ain't workin', no)
God put me on this earth for a purpose (For a purpose, yeah)
The toughest nigga in the room, they be workin' (They be workin')
Like they'll turn me to snake, but it ain't worth it (Worth it, no)

And I'll cut you off, ain't comin' right
Night time, hungry, hold my tummy tight
Can't repeat what I seen them summer nights
They don't wanna see us come alive

How the niggas who went Hollywood stay rappin' 'bout the trenches?
Had to cut niggas off who was all in their feelings
I told him cut his bitch off, seen her ridin' with them niggas
And I find that shit crazy, they hate with who begins 'em
Yeah, I'm so 10 toes, I'm who they fuckin' with
Them niggas talkin' bad about me, tell 'em suck a dick
I told my brothers that we blood, I don't know who my cousins
And if you is, you hang with them, you know what it is
I swear I'd go back to jail for all my brothers' kids
I swear I'd go back to jail to see my brothers live
Shoot you, then follow the ambulance, make sure you dead for real
Your parents rich, you silver spoon, my family ain't left a will
And we ain't doin' no sneaky talk, their ass had left for real
And why he talkin' out his chest like he is made of steel?
Them niggas ain't worried 'bout no shooters, them niggas made to kill
I put my heart inside my music, I got pain for real
Jackson lost his grandma, I got pain for him
Made me call my grandma way more

Can't repeat what I seen them summer nights
They don't wanna see us come alive

I had talent, you ain't believe me
Then you tried to come around like this shit was easy
When you not around, that shit like Mario without Luigi
Put her in that St. Laurent, I took her out that Bebe
Told my mama that I'm famous, see me on the TV
And I gotta play for keeps, I know my vultures need me
That Perky got me E.T., I got her suckin' weewee
I know some niggas tear your face off, GP
I elevated
Had to go and take off, I never waited
On God, I love your ass to death, I never hated
And you ain't come from the bottom, you by the basement, uh
Me and you was splittin' chicken wings from Harold's Chicken
Me and you, goin' house to house for Thanksgiving
Me and you, said the drugs give a strange feelin'
Me and you, me and you, me and you
Uno, dos, tres and, one, two, thee blessings

I'm living that lifestyle, livin' that lifestyle
I'mma need it right now, right now
I'm living that lifestyle, I'm livin' that lifestyle
That money I need it right now, I need it right now
I need my money

Can't drop a mention about the opposition, forty flicker like a camera vision
Dead bodies pitching, picture nothing better than the feeling
Need cash fast , smoking dope gas mask, since a kid with the cig with my bad ass
Broke bitches see it ain't my biz, but a nigga is the pigs with his fat ass
I'd take a slug for mine, lifestyle to live cause I love to grind
Judge gave his ass a double trial
My sister, brother crying but I can not fold up
No .48, and I ain't tote none, blood thicker likewater, put this on my daughter
Building gone, these niggas ain't loyal they snitches shits
Since Nuski passed I got to get shit, empty shit, thinking bro I got to get rich
Catch the killer I'mma sip for him, like the lord just sinned for him
Like I'm the maker, 
slang caine like the Undertaker
Ops like getting confiscated, I'm just turnin' up on the block on haters
Tell them that I made it


Quavo!
Young nigga bout my money, act a fool, this the lifestyle that I had to choose
Waking up at 9, kick 5 doors at a time, you can walk in the mall with designer shoes
Niggas they get you bout money, they hungry for honey
Meanwhile I'm over here in a foreign country, nigga wanna know who done it
You gotta survive, the jungle safari, I'm a legend alive
You got no rings like Amar'e
, pull out the chopper I'm sorry
Do you remember the days I was down, I couldn't afford it
Now I'm on, got the Bently coupe, and it came equipped with the Forgis
Take him back to the bando, when a nigga had a J snortin'
OTF and Migo Gang, young, rich niggas important
Nigga better learn a lesson, young nigga this the Migo story
Nigga better have my money, grab the 'chete, chop him down like a forrest

I'm living that lifestyle, I'm livin' that lifestyle
That money I need it right now, I need it right now

Offset! Right now! Right now!
In my windy while I'm flying, demy fly, north side, I reside
Entrepreneur independent did it on my own, yeah it was I
Pistol Pete, my nigga Dada
I had to shed a tear, I had to cry, I couldn't believe it when she got revived
The streets is a jungle he didn't survive
Guala, peso, euro make a movie call me Robert Dinero
Wrestler flexing Eddie Guerrero
 go to the riches the streets is narrow
Right now, you can get it right now, I run to the money dont need a tie
I'm watching my back like I am a owl, 30 round extension
Laugh at you niggas like Richard Pryor, minimum wage I make 40 thou'
You trusting that bitch she won't' hold you down
Smoking on loud, that's surround sound
There's a knock at the door I look at the peep hole
I leave you with stiches so where is Lilo?
Pay me my money before it get repoed
All the dirt that I did, And the lord he still chose

Glock nineteen, it's tucked on me
Caught you so I clutch on it
Told my plug to rush on it
Fly paper, she stuck on me
She want a Birkin bag
She pulled up in a purple Jag
Bumpin' Durk and Bagg

I heard that shit that you said, it got back to me
And I'm talking to the dead, just talk back to me
I wish Pluto called my phone and he could jock with me
I wish Nuski was in the studio to rock with me
Niggas gotta run they mouth because we run the city
We put drums on them choppers, man, I love them titties
It be crazy 'cause the ones you love in competition
Just kill me, don't alley-hoop me to the opposition
Just feel me, just pay attention, it ain't hard to listen
Just listen, you was my homie, why'd you keep your distance?
Prescription, I pop a Perky, now I'm reminiscing
Let's get it, we all can eat, I'm in a good position

We just politicking and we talkin' about different shit
We speakin' on, on, on thoroughbreds and real niggas
And, and, and the sacrifices they made
The, the, the Gino Colons and the Larry Hoovers, the David Barksdales
The Fidos and Big Durks and the Terry Youngs
You know, the ones that deserve to be acknowledged
And the ones that should be acknowledged for being thorough

I came from Kix cereal, ramen noodles, powdered Kool-Aid without the sugar
I remember taking bundles, stealing it without them lookin'
Spend the night at Coli crib just because his mama cookin'
Why you thinkin' that we pussy? Just believe it's never cookie
That's sweet, yeah, yeah, that's sweet
I remember letting niggas hold shit the next week
I'm talking back then, seven deep on backseats
I remember back then, old homies tried to whack me
I know they mad they ain't stay and we got it
We rich as hell, in five stars eating salad
And I was sleeping on that floor, sharing pallettes
I got in my bag on one song, now it's a habit, yeah
Why they don't love me, love me, love me, love me, love me, love me, love me?

Know what I'm sayin', this is a Love Songs for the Streets 2 vibe, know what I'm sayin'?

I made it (They mad!)
Told them I'ma make it!
(Broke niggas ain't gon' make it that far)
Turn up

They hatin' already, make me feel like I made it already
I came from nothin', climb to the top 'cause I made it already
They ain't wanna believe me, I'm their favorite already
Cars and hoes and jewels and clothes, I made it already
I made it, I made it
I made it, I made it
I'm poppin' bottles, I'm faded
I made it, I made it

Niggas say I made it, got these niggas hatin'
Money team, I swear it feels like a bank that raised me
Who'd a thought, the top spot, that I'd make it?
Bronem got that 30 and bronem go crazy
But I ain't really worried bout 'em
Always got beef, but I ain't hear about em
Chanel belt match the red bottoms
She with you to get the bread out you
Strip club, throw a couple thousand
You could see they face when the bread pilin'
See these 50's with the swearholic
Broke ass nigga, turn to cab drivers
Everything foreign, come from different countries
All these bad bitches, gettin' different money
If you niggas hatin', go and get some money
If you niggas hatin', Go and get some money

They hatin' already, make me feel like I made it already
I came from nothin', climb to the top 'cause I made it already

I made it, I made it
I made it, I made it
I'm poppin' bottles, I'm faded
I made it, I made it

They hatin', I made it, I hate em for hatin'
""I changed my mind"", crazy, why the fuck you got statements?
And I started from the bottom, why the fuck they hatin' on me?
Long time ago, had nothin' to snack on
Had nobody to lean my back on
No dyke, put the strap on
'Cause it's hard out here
Rich nigga you left to starve out here
Gotta play ya part out here
Can't let em put ya cards out here
'Cause I made it, it's a celebration
Why the fuck they hatin' on me? (Let's get it!)
All the fancy cars, fancy clothes, fancy hoes, I got it
Everything I got right now, as a kid, I couldn't imagine
And I gotta have it, my shootas toe taggin'
And you niggas might win, but my nigga's soul priceless
And y'all on the light shit
Red bottoms, fuck all that Mike shit
I made this song, iont write shit
Yeah I'm arrogant, 'cause I made it

They hatin' already, make me feel like I made it already
I came from nothin', climb to the top 'cause I made it already
They ain't wanna believe me, I'm their favorite already

We too loyal to let this money change us, shit not royal
Get out these streets lil bro, this shit ain't for you
Just know that shit a lie when they say they love you
Gotta watch out for that knife when they come and hug you
'Cause it be the same niggas to come and slug you
I'm product of my environment
Bro a ex-killer, come out retirement
If he go down by himself for that case he'll tie you in
They gon' pull your strings like a violin
They gon' shoot your shit in traffic, no matter what car you in
Went to the streets and asked the dope boys is they hiring?
Gotta shoot something just to be with us, can't sign you in
If you over there and you don't 'pose to, you gon' die with them

All I wanted was the money, never wanted fame
Niggas actin' like they know me, they don't even know my pain
Bitch actin' like she know me, she don't even know my name
I'm a son of a king but ain't no crown when we talk reign

Put my trust in niggas when I should have known better
Bustin' my pistol, when it's empty, nigga gon' tell it

We got Glocks, Ks, TECs, nigga and bazookas (straight up)
Clip long like a ruler (straight up!)

I just say it 2 times with this money, money and it's on me, on me
Why you tweakin' ain't my homie, homie (Gang!)
Get this cash, cash, I just want it fast, fast
I'mma spaz, spaz
Get on yo' ass, ass (Gang! Gang!)
No need for vest, vest
Aim, aim, head, head, chest, chest, yes, yes (Dope)
Shooters, shooters with me, with me
Why you playin' 50s, 50s, 50s, 50s, 50s, 50s (Gang!)

Me I just came out of poverty
I just spent 50 on property
I'm from the streets to the gun violence
Glocks annihilate you probably
I pour up a four for my dead guys
My hood is more than a block to me
I keep a jock on me, a couple killas ain't no opps with me
Bitches want sex I want all mouth
We be them niggas they talkin' 'bout
I'm saucin' I'm walkin', I'm Wayne now
Don't treat I'm coolin' with gang now
Overdose I'm like Wayne now
Before we was strapped like Girbaud jeans
Now we spend 50 on chains now
And we put 50 on things now
Booty died from dialysis
Opp niggas was the happiest
The city know we be wacking shit
Real killa, ain't know accident
Crackin' calls with the MACs and shit
Got the pounds and I'm matchin' shit
Guns and dope in the mattress shit
Fuck nigga with the actin' shit
Gang!

I just say it 2 times with this money, money and it's on me, on me
Why you tweakin' ain't my homie, homie (Gang!)

Rockstar lifestyle, might not make it
Put prescription drugs on my tongue, I had to take it
Keep my secrets deep down inside, I had to face it
For you, I put my life on the line, that shit felt crazy

They gon' ride still, them ain't Percs, them Advils
Don't you hate when the guys tell? Hate results from a nine shell
Take the fans off of lockdown, Securus call, I'ma press one
Felony on my background, gun license, you ain't got one
Trigger finger, catch a nine one, I remember swipin' bad cards
I remember wifin' bad bulls, broke nigga thought the vibe off
I remember totin' cap guns, a lot of pounds of that platinum
A lot of pounds, I go platinum, woah (Rockstar), rockstar
Nigga, fuck your homie, I heard they cappin' too
My homie pull up lookin' like me, you would think they rappin' too
They kill you dead, they sit down calm and smoke a black or two
Salt on his name, they tried to frame him, free Makado

A rockstar lifestyle, might not make it
Put prescription drugs on my tongue, I had to take it
Keep my secrets deep down inside, I had to face it

Just tryna get rich, cause my people kinda struggled
Couple ten year niggas poor, but the hood still love me
Got my feet into the door, but this hood shit is ugly

‘Fore I hang with the fake I’m in the studio getting it
They stop a lot of shows, I ain’t did shit, I don’t get it
And my baby still eating, see em on the weekdays and the weekends
Child support got dropped, I told that bitch that we even
Bitch sang till no breathing, tryna kill me for no reason
Tryna take me down cause I’m leading
Vision my story, no reading
Is you mad cause I make more, or is you mad what I drive
Is you mad cause I’m not poor, or you mad I’m alive
Nobody answer that, ask me one thing Imma answer back
Got a little money don’t act like that
But I don’t trust nobody

Know what I'm sayin' like, I'm the one they look up to, you dig

Let me tell you a story
A story when I was a shorty
I went to school on a daily
And I was totin' my .40
My homie got pounds on pounds
I go over his crib like a forest
Askin' can he put me on now
Like why you ignoring me
I tell em go pull up a Taurus
At the top shootin a Taurus
I mix up a 8 and I pour it
I left my feelings in storage
Remember I jumped out the Porsches
You ain't no killa, ain't torch it
Don't get caught in the mornin'
We catch you, then we scorin'
Wash that blood with chlorine
You say I'm a hoe, you don't know me
I get you touched with no cheese
Gotta watch out cause I'm lowkey
Niggas be cool with the police
I made a dub off 4P
I'm in the trap with 4 P's
I went and copped me a rollie

I dun' showed love to these niggas
But I mistreated niggas who gon' rock with me to the end
Forgive me again, just gimme yo hand
Them ain't my friends
Y'all my friends
Give me a chance
Give me a chance...
Give me one more chance
Give me one more chance
Give me one more chance
Give me one more chance

Man I thought you was my dawg but you tricked me
You tryna play me close but niggas know you out to get me
Should've known when I said nah
You cut me off that shit was fishy
I trust you with my secrets but you went and told my business
Wanna be on the Forbes with you
I dun' slept on the floors with you
I dun' went to war with you
And we ain't have no pistols
I tell you stories when we both was dirty
When I was broke I was splittin' the perc'y
When I went broke I sold my .30
Couldn't get by and that shit hurt me
Caught with a gun, that shit was jerky
Called for a murder, they ain't showin' no mercy
Snake yo blood, that shit ain't worth it
At the same time ain't no one perfect
Went on a hit, that nigga was nervous
But I was blind cause nigga too thirsty
Caught me a body, I built my courage
Gotta watch out cause my dog was informin'

Represent,For Greater Glory 2.5,2012.0,"Represent
Take a picture, just a naked, just a flick
For a nigga, she'll probably kill a bitch
My people's, my people's
I see both

You've been rooting for a nigga for a minute
But to do this here exclusively, I lose you in a second
And your views are independent, but your friends gossip
See even if I kept my nose clean, they'd still claim it's snot up
Ok I love the fact that she loyal, and she love the fact that I get beat
And I love the fact that she huh, cause she love the fact I get beat
See love is making her weak is making her think she maybe need me
But the thought of making me stay is making me think I maybe need to leave
If I told you that I love you would you listen
Probably meant it if said it, yeah I'm sippin'
But that liquor, bring the honesty out a nigga
She got me, then I'mma get her


Look at her in her eyes, can't trust her 'round my guys
That faithful shit don't work, can't let her feed me them lies
But I always represent, for me she killed a bitch
I buy expensive shit, it's me she rocking wit'
Gucci, Louie, Fendi, she deserve all that
Her friends they kinda hate me, cause I think I'm all that
White coupe cloth roof, and the car shaking
It's just me and you, but we could add Franklin's
I represent like lawyers, I ball so hard like Jordan
I take a pic I promise, I'm Range Rover sportin'
She like heaven in my eyes, my bitch in disguise

All the words you said out your mouth, I thought you was true with it
I was down bad on my dick, felt like you was cool with it
You even chopped me on some grams, ain't know what to do with it
You said you pulled up on that car and you had blew in it
Your secret safe with me
My brother for eternity
Fake love, ain't wasting energy
Said you'd take a picture with the enemies

We was fucked up, splittin' Mickey D's
Ridin' in that Nissan, hopin' for some Bentley keys
I was tellin' you about my problems with my kids and niece
I ain't have no time for 'em, but I did for the streets
And I ain't gon' brag on what I did for the streets
I say I won't tell a soul what I did for the streets
Better keep your mouth closed what I did for the streets
Go up fifty a show, dropped

Rather fall out with my bitch then fall out with my brothers
Feel like we blood brothers, call each other's mamas mamas
They knew we was sellin' drugs, they told us hope we save for college
Fuckin' hoes raw dog, and we paid for condoms
Niggas said they gon' snake us after, shit, we playin' defense
Niggas who don't come 'round here came around but we had stayed and sneak diss
They say you ain't really got my back, don't know how I ain't peep it
Sometimes I went outside without it, you had told me keep it
Whole time these niggas who was trill, you told me they was sneaky
Lowkey I told them niggas fuck 'em, lowkey I was tweakin'
You who you is today, you got clout from me
Niggas lowkey in the way, streets can vouch for me

Sometimes I feel like ten your niggas will bust my brain, you hear me?
Like for that paper, for this clout shit, like
Know what I'm sayin', that shit bring disloyalty
Know what I'm sayin', I ain't gon' lie
I'd rather take myself out 'fore I let an opp
Or a nigga I call my brother
Know what I'm sayin', take me out this shit, like
Like if, if, if I die or they kill me or like
I hit rock bottom with no money, no nothing

Cause I do it for the trap niggas
I had to get back on my shit and go and get it
I keep my distance from these rap niggas

I feel like I started this shit
Lil' Durk I'm the heart of this shit
Sosa Sosa Ressey Ressey me, I'm like Pac in this shit
It's my arrogance saying
T-Farris can't spend me, moon dawg can't spend me
And these others niggas spend me
Niggas ain't give me my fame
Niggas ain't saying my name
Think about taking my chain
Thinking that I was a stain
Look at me now, look at the clout
Look at my diamonds, look at my house
Look at my bitch, look at trap
Look at me now fuck nigga look at me now

Nigga counted me out, should've counted me in
Fuck up the count on the milli, fuck it we count it again
Niggas they never could kill me, I'm going out with the win
I'm going out with my 30, banging on you and your friend
Bending the corner just me and Omelly we riding the seven
I pull up on niggas they never could touch in bulletproof Caddies
I'm hitting up BB and I'm calling Lolo to bring through the ladders
They bend through your corner they hitting whoever it don't even matter
Creeping through my block I'm looking for my man
Pussy nigga made me go and spend a hundred grand
The type of murder that your mama wouldn't understand
I bring it to him brown bag with the rubber band

I was all in it when nobody cared
Chino when DThang and SB was there
Niggas around I know they ain't care
Hit the street with that rally on me
That pussy fucking go mileage on it
Every song every bar I'm spazzing on 'em
Daddy had told me behave myself
The streets and the hoes so he paid the debt
One thing had told me be real and be young nigga
Nigga was screaming to save yourself
In the hood with that gun up on me
Money, lean, and my son up on me
Watch out for the phony homie they money hungry
The hood and the ghetto they told me go get it
My mama and daddy had told me go get it
The niggas beside me told me go get it
Go get it while these fuck niggas gon' spend me

Masks on for them cameras
On my own, no advances
Broken homes for advances

Shooters took him on a cruise

I'm still tryna get Zoo
Still chasing them millions
Daddy gave me the wisdom
Twenty-three years up in prison
I swear I seen his vision
Seen my son, I start tearin'
I took the game, wasn't given
Ditched school, hit the hood
The streets love me, I'm good
Shed tears if I could
Shed blood if I could
Share money if I could
Share guns if I could
Sell coke if I could
Sell dope if I could

Cookie ain't original
Love my niggas x and o's
Smokin' gas, Texaco
Found the plug in Mexico
All my diamonds eskimo
Off the Perc I text the most
Rob the nigga flex the most
Flex like international
Grab her ass and squeeze her throat
Bitches like to fuck with coke
Trenches I'm they only hope
Treat my like a fuckin goat
Shooter I cannot get poked
Pussy he don wan no smoke
Nut he a actually blow
Turn you to a casserole
Chiraq gotta ride with gats
Molly weed perks and x
Gotta keep yo niggas close
Never know who next to go
You broke what you slackin' for?
Killas they get cracked the most
Bronem got my back the most
System hate them blacks for sure
Shortys they be coo coo gang
They don ever ask to blow

Nope,  I can't save a hoe

Drugs, I could take the whole
Traffic, Ima take a pole

Lost auntie to cancer many I wish she battled
Caught that nigga lackin' man I wish we got him
Glad we didn't get him look up sight the camera
My bitch got a grill, she from Alabama
Ans that bitch a savage she ain't got no manners
She dropped outta school just to fuck a scammer
Told her he got get a car and get her off the campus
Bitches love drugs, I just gave her xannies
She don't swallow nut, call that lil bitch petty
I just need my cheese I just need my fetty
EDM with 8-track, I might get some becky
All black Glock, just to match the Dickies
And I bought my bitch a watch just to match Meek and Nicki
Had to jump up at the gang shit was gettin' tricky
If it feel like I can't trust you then i’m uppin’ blicky
And I'm vegetarian, fuck some chicken
And you ain't your scariest, you duckin' niggas

Career day in school, never be a policeman
Top floor of the Fountain Blue, havin' threesomes
Look you in your eyes, say they love you, just don’t believe them
In the trenches, gotta play 'em close like you need 'em
Chest pains, I was sippin’ lean by the liter
How you screamin' that you got some killers? You don't feed 'em
Booka steady trippin' when I say I don't believe in Jesus
Don't ever put your all into a bitch 'cause she gon’ leave
And I know a couple Atlanta hoes that wear her lashes
In the trap, I fucked the baddest bitches on the mattress
Givin’ to the trenches, took advantage of my kindness
I done gave a nigga a lot of pounds without askin'
Government, did they shut down? He got his time in
Damn well, he ain’t 'posed to be on home confinement
Killers right on standby off my word just like Simon
I can judge a nigga by his character off his diamonds
I know a nigga, he shootin' dice with the Ts
But how you say that when I give him all he needs?
And even though he ain't show no love, I tried to reach
In Commonwealth, he took a dub, nigga, please

Is it possible they love you like they say they do?
Is it possible, your homies, they gon’ hate on you?
For that check, how your day ones gon' lay on you
Is they keepin' it 1000 like they say they do?
They don't understand me, addicted to them Xannys
Told you I ain't friendly, it's Only The Family
Is it possible you gon' ride?
Is it possible you gon' ride?

Out on 1300, so don't act like you can't find us
Tim-Tim lost his life, I bang the same block he died for
September 18th, ain't that the same shit we cry for?
Mall of niggas got to slidin' when them tears dried up
Made it out them trenches, we young vets and survivors
Learned so much from that corner, bumped my head, but now I'm wiser
Chasin' after trends, I risked my freedom for designer
Almost lost my life, got out and I was on that timer
Now I hit up treasures with a hundred thousand on me
I don't fuck with niggas, I'm with  or by my lonely
Loyalty not slow, you gotta watch out for your homies
If any nigga play, a deadman is what he gon' be

Is it possible they love you like they say they do?
Is it possible, your homies, they gon' hate on you?
For that check, how your day ones gon' lay on you
Is they keepin' it 1000 like they say they do?
They don't understand me, addicted to them Xannys
Told you I ain't friendly, it's Only The Family

I'm just tryna heat the crib up with the stove lights
I'm just reminiscing 'bout my old life
We was running 'round them streets in the cold nights
Reminiscing 'bout my old life
Some nights it do be feeling like you alone, right?
Reminiscing 'bout your old life
It be feeling you gon' die
Certain shit ain't goin' right
Mansion on the hills, long way from scales
Steady tryna kill me, name ringin' bells
When you lose appeals, probably gon' tell
You done poppin' pills, they probably give you the chills
He lost fifty pounds probably in the mail
I gotta hold 'em down, shout out to the jail
Get hit up with some rounds, chopper make you frail
Shawty want a Draco, he don't want Chanel
Watch out for leeches, shootout, screechin'
Ducking polices, moving strategic
Voices, the voices, they say that I'm preaching
Went through them courses, they really ain't believe me

Wanna see the family members who turnt up and shitted on me
Wanna see them trap niggas who got money and shitted on me
Wanna see my teachers said I won't be shit, now I'm shittin' on em

Real shit man
So when you all say blood you all mean blood?
OTF this is family nigga
This shit ain’t war it’s blood

Go through so much, nobody know
Hand on my pipe can't trust a soul
Times ain't the same we getting old
These niggas fu they get exposed
That's on my soul, my soul, my soul, my soul
Devil want my soul, my soul, my soul
Who said I sold my soul for gold and clothes and hoes
No, no, no, no, no, no

Feel my pain, how you feel my shoes, can't feel my name
Once I hit the top I ain't gone change that's on my soul
Once you know about waking up in the middle of the snow
Seeing the news watching people dead that you know
I lost niggas but family different
My niggas family so tell me what's different
I came in late selling packs, momma tripping
I'm feeding family so tell me who get it
I ain't go to school I was on that block
I needed education, I forgot
You could forgive but never forget
Whatever I'm with my niggas they with

Go through so much, nobody know
Hand on my pipe can't trust a soul
Times ain't the same we getting old
These niggas fu they get exposed
That's on my soul, my soul, my soul, my soul
Devil want my soul, my soul, my soul
Who said I sold my soul for gold and clothes and hoes
No, no, no, no, no, no

I know the consequences of my actions
Knew I'll be rich when I start rapping
When shit was real, when niggas lacking
Just made our city murder capital
I said fuck school I was always absent
Niggas need oscars, they always acting
Niggas is bitches they always reacting
I tell a nigga he get clapped like magic
Me and my niggas we been through so much
For that band my niggas get you touched
Break your legs that ain't enough
And this my city ain't letting up

I'ma ride for my brothers
I'll die for them, that's on my mother
Only the streets can feel my struggle
One thing about 'em ain't no other
I raise hell in my city (And I know, I know, I know, I know)
I raise hell in my city, so be prepared in my city

Lost Nuski and Pat to a bunch of these bitch niggas
Street nigga heart but the mind of a rich nigga
What's happenin', go back me and bro never switch, nigga
O Town, late night studio, smokin', stain
Couple drinks, tryna get me to sip, nigga
Gave bro thirty something years, he ain’t a snitch nigga
I don't know what's going on with half of these split niggas
One minute in the house next time wanna spit niggas
My city respect and honor me
Ain't a killer but break the bond and see
Muzzle with the chop, trigger finger water
I bet it could part a sea
I'll decease for my niggas
Twenty one years in the streets with my niggas
And that's to my momma, she know about my brother
She know she playin' for keeps, nigga
Late night tryin' stretch somethin'
Dice game, sellin' drugs, it ain't safe after dark, nigga
Call bro, bring the pole, thirty six O’s, then you know not to park nigga
And it’s hell in my city, two shots hit head or tail in my city
War time if it's animosity, and I got the squad to rock with me

I'ma ride for my brothers
I'll die for them, that's on my mother
Only the streets can feel my struggle
One thing about 'em ain't no other
I raise hell in my city (And I know, I know, I know, I know)
I raise hell in my city, so be prepared in my city

Ride, I'm a rider
Beef with my squad then theres no survivors
Young niggas fourteen, no L's that be drivin'
Then catch a body on a nigga be lackin', we 'bout violence
Let alcohol trick you to a coffin
Think I'm sweet tell lil' bro to off 'em
Chicago on my back, nigga
No love in hip-hop cause we don't act nigga
Sip act nigga on the block with a Mac nigga
No money but we tax niggas
Nigga's city show love to the rap niggas
That's my all my L's go loyal
And these niggas, these bitches ain't loyal
And these streets, these streets ain't for you
And I'm a rider so save that shit for them other niggas

Magazine tryin' to vibe with us, hoppin' out that black Benz tryin' to slide with us

If I call it how I see it they say I'm racist
Let's face it
If Donald Trump win the spot, then we back to the basics
No more link, no more WIC, no more free shots when you sick
No more S.S.I. checks, either coming for your kids
I'm for not who would of though I would make a million of of pot
Feds on me why you think I used to turn down all the slots
Tired of seein' my niggas die, on they days they momma cryin'
Opps crazy on IG tell them niggas calm it down
Heard niggas telling now, they come around I shut it down
And I keep a couple rounds
And I keep a couple rounds

When I leave I don't know if I'ma make it back
You don't need nothing to relate to that
The thought of my kids suffering, I hate the fact
Say goodbye to your mom, before you every think of doing me  bodily harm
Even though the war is on, you've got to be calm
It's a time to keep quiet, a time to respond
Nah, you'll never be fly as the Don
I shoot you man in his head, let him die in your arms

They love you more, they adore you more 'cause you made it
They turned they back on me, I forgave 'em, I'm crazy
Them niggas gon' go, them niggas gon' roll whenever I say it
Them niggas some hoes, them niggas some hoes, they don't get attention
You would try to ignore when I'm at my lowest, I don't forgive you
I was at my lowest, I couldn't afford it, I was so miserable
I was ditchin' school, mixing lean and juice, I was off chemicals
I ain't got a choice, I got a voice, this shit difficult
Waking up to three million dollars cash, that shit a miracle
Can't let a bitch put me on blast, I'm too spiritual
They say I gotta let go of the past, I ain't hearing you",https://genius.com/Lil-durk-outro-lyrics

Don’t Judge Me,Remember My Name,2015.0,"They be tryna judge me

They be tryna judge me
They don't know my story
Tell me why they hate me
Don't judge me (don't judge me), don't judge me (don't judge me)

Loyalty was the key to these street niggas (let's get it)
Chains, cars, cribs, since a kid I used to think I was Meech nigga
Starving, crib full of family I can't sleep without balling
So I watch D Rose play (often)
Aunty died from cancer so I rap to keep the laughs
I'd rather pray when I'm alone than steady giving shit to pastors
Daddy gone since I was in pampers, he get out when I'm a pimp
Old and a dead man, hands still on the hammer
Niggas talking 'bout they my mans and we friends
Where you was you at when that man with that lanz offered me ten?
Shackled up, with the niggas that we hit with the fan
Eating shit that we gathered in blan
President still black, I hope he change shit
Niggas out here fifty, doing the same shit
When he say he got my back it rain pit
Don't judge me, I know the streets love me (yeah, talk to 'em)

They be tryna judge me
I thought that they loved me
But they don't really know me
Please don't judge me (don't judge), don't judge me (don't judge)

Tell me why they hate me
Don't judge me (don't judge me), don't judge me (don't judge me)

Dope dealers, cold killers, they want niggas told nigga
Half them killers told on 'em, had my chopper and road with 'em
My mouth close though, I can't snitch on a nigga
Pillow talking to ops and hoes, bitch of a nigga
Summer nights, all them drugs made me kill shit
I lost so many niggas if they down I ain't feel shit
Been on IG with my nigga, the feel rent
Them niggas just made me, I kept it real with it and they ain't loyal though
Mind of a psycho twelve posted on light poles
Sold crack to the light though, going crazy I might though
RIP who I cry to, hold my hands on my head cause I got to
Yeah, I'm loyal nigga

Damn...

I was deep in the field on this street shit
Late night I was starving ain't eat shit
Studio thinking hits, tryna get rich
Hanging with a lot of niggas that was counterfeit
I was too real tote a blue steel
Had a deal, had a deagle
No deal, I was breaking packs
Had to feed and go kill, post till I had M's
Then I had to go chill with a couple racks
I'm a real man
Studio 24 like a Laker fan
Street shit, had to take it in
War time out late I ain't take it in
I had to make amends
See you the red light
Creep on you with the red light
Strip a forty, getcha head right
Homocide slide
Ion't know nothing I was on the road doing shows so bye bye
Well connected like Wifi
Ion't know shit I can't tell on my guys
Smoking on this spinach game, Popeye
And my niggas do a drill
Nigga up pipe call it show and tell
Light a nigga brain like emmit till
Do a drill, they for real, they'll kill

Niggas snitching they informing
Street shit was important
Back then I couldn't afford it
Yellow ice bitch stone Jeff Ford shit
They see how he spending them forges
Try to rob me, end up in a morgue place
Or storage place with no face
I'm talking 'bout I'ma hammer baking soda
If the block dryy then I'm taking over
Police they take it I'ma make it over
Give me a brick and I'ma break it over
You ready, I'm ready
You with it, I'm with it
Let's get it, you talk but don't get it
Put D in that skillet

Say I gotta when I got that

I came from a house of four, plus my momma and my grandmomma, no daddy you know what I'm sayin' daddy been gone so I ain't really have no choice but to be the man. I've been running the streets since I was 12, 13 years old. You know what I'm sayin' sellin' drugs, you know what I'm sayin' shootouts. I'm thinkin' it's like a good thing, but I'm stressing my momma, my grandmomma out so I ain't really have no choice but to move my family up out the hood, I ain't have no choice to leave Chicago and move to the A and get my own crib. 6, 7 bedrooms, you know what I'm sayin' mini mansion like it feel good to even start like that man. I ain't have no choic, went to jail 3, 4 times and had major setbacks. Get out of jail, it's a whole new wave. Every time, get out second time, it's a whole new wave so I ain't really have a chance but to really like catch up, you know what I'm sayin'? Give y'all this story, you know what I'm sayin' and I feel like by the end of the day, I gotta come out on top, you know what I'm sayin' 'cause all odds is against me, you know what I'm sayin'?

I promise 2017 I'ma be the best boy
Can't fall, I gotta prevail can't be like the rest of 'em

I'm from the slum, hopin' to see some better days
That low income, being less for the section 8
Say what you want, makin' sure that my family straight
One hit song, call the people want 100k
Give me yo' pint and I'm bustin' it, we tried to finesse a nigga
Sippin' these medicine, I'm tired of the stressin'
I be really sittin' back thinkin' niggas fuck with me yeah I'm guessin' it
It's indefinite
I got a question in it
You can't relate to my music, I don't want yo' credit
Left my city, I went to yours, 'cause I gotta get it
I'm a savage with fashion, this is not a gimmick
I come from low-income I tell 'em I'm a menace

I love my sister to death her love ain't got no limit
She say I got rich and left, she say I'm actin' different
She said say no to them drugs, them 30s got me trippin'
She say don't never sacrifice I told her that's for publicity
I'm from the pound originally, I started singin' they mimic me
How you gon' kill  her, you jittery
Nuski's killer had his misery
I had 10 cases in felony of Chicago 'cause I was holdin' a .40
I've been snaked up by my own family, I've been tryin' to avoid it
(Let's get it)
Shit they better pray for me
Tell my momma it ain't safe for me
Bitch nigga get away from me
Kill anybody got no sympathy

Everything he say out his mouth straight cap
I call Von, he steer with the MAC
I don't sip drink but I do miss Act'
I know a young nigga that'll work this pack
See him one time and he can't get a pass
None of my shooters gon' put on a mask
They gon' kill whoever they catch
Nigga want gas, I'll put on a tax
Nigga better run when that Hellcat scratch
You can't come around, you don't boot up off x
I can't come down, just give me my meds
Only The Fam', ain't really got friends
I spent two thousand on a pair of pants
I'm real street, nigga, I need romance
I told her come down, she don't suck with no hands
Niggas ain't gang, they really be fans

They say when I talk, sound like I preach
They say they love when I talk to the streets
If you not real, stop talkin' to me
If you not trill, stop talkin' to me, woah
'Posed to be my brother, woah
Showed your true colors
Niggas actin' like they for us
But I thought we had each other, woah

We used to serve in the alley
I talk to my pops on the tablet
I fuck with the T's, they valid
I fuck with the stones, they valid
Prices lower than Cali'
The flight's a thousand and somethin'
But Ralo got caught on the private
I hate all the cops with a passion
Fast car, so I don't gotta stash it
Too high, I keep bands near the glasses
Bitch niggas, they make me the maddest
I done seen niggas snitch on the status
Killers slide in the night like Gladys
From the hood where they flip off a mattress
Where they light crack pipes for mattresses
Where they try to put air in their baggies
Where they'll try lower your standards
Why you tryna get me on camera?
Talkin' bout murders, I vanish
And I want my plug to speak Spanish
And I like my ho to be managed
Where the feds did a sweep, it did damage
Where the feds did a sweep, it did

They say when I talk, sound like I preach
They say they love when I talk to the streets
If you not real, stop talkin' to me
If you not trill, stop talkin' to me, woah
'Posed to be my brother, woah
Showed your true colors

I nutted all in her and left I told her I got vasectomy
Why them getting to @‘ing me?
Said they catching me they stretching me
Bronem be watching my back they know I be gone off the medicine
My cousin had died on cam, the police got footage and edit it
Big facts, on god, I can't get shit snatched
Can't leave I need that get back
Fuck shot I need you kidnapped
Suprise that the Glock come get frown

Seen the opps and you ain't shoot, lil nigga you dead wrong
You got mad at me through text but I think you read wrong
I talk to my pops every day in the feds cause he got a cellphone
I kiss my kids on the head every day cause I live in a hellhole
I spent like 300 racks on my bitch, they said my head gone
I salute niggas like Lil Charles, did nine, and still ain't tell none
These niggas don't play with us, we said it and it's gon' get done
Grew up in the hood, when I go to sleep I'm duckin' bedbugs
Retaliate for Keef, he a folk cause he show mad love
Sixteen and a killer with no ID, I send that cash out
Fuck the other side, fuck the other side, fuck the other side
I know you know you touch these golds, they take your soul
If you ain't gang and you come around, we take your pole
Know some famous hoes in my DM, I made them touch they toes
Five'nem hit you five times with that Glock, that's cause they Moes (Stones)
And we steady making all these packs, these niggas better check the score
And we steady rolling up these opps, these niggas better check the score
Boy, your diamonds so SI, you can't get cash for gold
Limousine, stretch him, I can't wait 'til we catch him (Pack)
Hellcat scratch him, spot him, got him
Foenem got him, he gon' be dead
I can't at him, he ain't no snake, so why he rattle?
His ass a rat, I know he tattle
I know day one's who was here for the battle

Ah, oh, off these drugs, I can't feel my face
When I'm 'round different niggas, I be feeling outta place
And I'm over 17, I'll still take my brother case
If I talk back to my old hoes, I feel like I'm outta place
These Alexander McQueen shoes, I feel like I'm outta space
If I take some that you ain't do, I feel like I'm outta place
Outta place, outta place, outta place, outta place
I'm outta place, outta place, outta place
I feel I'm outta place

I told my main circle I got 'em
Whatever it is, it really don't matter, I got 'em (Yeah)
Three million cash for my next album,  cash do matter
Doing good, but you could do better
I feel off and turned to an addict
I pick X pills over addy
I send big love to my granny
I fucked a hooper bitch in Miami
I can't say her name cause that'd do damage
I fucked eight times and I changed my number
I would say the team but that'd be petty
No handshakes, head nod
Go to Iowa to get it off
All the opps fanned out, every time they look up it's man down
Put some money on my head, I'ma tell you right now go get it back
You brought them lies to the people on the homicide but you spilled them facts
Don't sit around me, they shot your homie, pussy got get him back
Get him whacked, homicide
We don't apologize, your street rep is denied
Pussy told us slide, that's when he died
Rocket launcher, Number-huh

Ah, oh, off these drugs, I can't feel my face
When I'm 'round different niggas, I be feeling outta place
And I'm over 17, I'll still take my brother case
If I talk back to my old hoes, I feel like I'm outta place
These Alexander McQueen shoes, I feel like I'm outta space
If I take some that you ain't do, I feel like I'm outta place

In a bikini in Pacsun, you too good, you must practice
All of the moves, hittin' a nigga with combos up in the condo

Late for court, I damn near hit civilian
I'm not trippin', I'm tryna get millions
Voice of the streets and all my niggas with it
I'm the same nigga, ain't nothin' different
This just a message, I hope the streets can hear me
You traded on me, man, that had me trippin'

Somebody tell Pluto I ain't have time to listen (Oh)
Chiraq, I'm Jordan, so I wonder who Pippen?
What I do with this money, they standing on business

Hated schools stay strapped
I can't say I hate rap
Nights I had to play that
Just so I'd have somewhere to lay at
2 sisters, 1 brother, 4 empty rooms, no cover
 car cut short, she sold it for some G money
I'm here everyday with my niggas claimin' 300
Jam lock, Tim lock, Law Lock, 40 lock
More ops and more op thats why I can't keep my 40 Glock
Felon below 
But I carry anyway
Learn lesson, learn life
Realest them have shot at me
Snitchin' didn't apply to me
Kept it closed happily
 doin' good,  doin good
Twin totin' on parole he still in the hood
 sayin' since day one still up to no good
Nuski got the strap still will burn you like some wood
My daddy went down for the set we beef with now
I respect my hundred grand but I'm in the streets now
My motto is my motto i'm playin' for keeps now
Its body for a body
You send shots we send em back
Time for my first case, your lady got sent back
They say I'm startin' violence, say I'm promotin' violence

And you got to hide your finesse game
Head shot, no need for a vest game
Cop killers going straight through the desk game
These niggas they bitch, they’ll snitch on you
How you think they feel, get rich on em
You ain’t never do a drill with a brick on em
Even on parole keep the shit on em
No mask, black hoodie with the sticks on him
I lost a couple niggas to this shit
Chiraq, where the guns like Iraq
Where the little niggas cook Pyrex
Where they pull guns out, they’ll fight back

Play crazy, have a lil bro knock him down
On the block in that Cut when it’s black out
Y’all homies tell bro bring the MACs out
And we’re hungry in the trap house
Every show we’re out, bringing out the racks out
Setup hoes they’ll set you up
How you come when it’s dry they’ll wet you up
Watch out, my niggas at the top
You gotta kiss they ass for them to let you up
And that bring them snakes out
Gunshots that’ll bring them jakes out
Every new rapper they fake now
If you stand we'll call that a take down
Eat with who you sleep with
So blind to the money, you ain’t peeped shit

Drop my van's, I'm the man
Free Lil Law , and free Lil Jam
Get my hitters out the jail
I spend money on the ground
So you know I got that work
Niggas talking, my name Durk
True Religion's and a shirt
Got a Mac, ?
Ain't no talking cause I told you

I'm a animal
I got my chopper in the trunk and I'mma damage you
I got my niggas in the cut, and they punish you
I got my shooters with the scope, and they aim at you
Cause we some animals
And I'm a animal
I got the chopper in the trunk, and I'mma damage you
I got my niggas in the cut, and they punish you
I got my shooters with the scope, and they aim at you
Cause I'm a animal, cause I'm a animal

All my life I do me, I'm riding and I'm totting
What I'm smoking is potent, I rub her like a Trojan
300, know she going
Yeah, I know she going
And I know she going, like Shady bitch I go in
Fake Forgiato, that shit I don't like
Color truck cream, cause that coka come in all type
Money dancing wicked Louie, we be in it all night
All night, all night
And my wrist barely bright
I be sipping white Remy, I be on my boss shit
All white clothes, today indicted my closet
How you piss I'm the shit, ho's spin like the toilet
40 get your dirty mouth clean, chewing Orbit
I be in the factory, stacks in my Truey'
And my belt Louie, rolling off of Gucci
Bad bitches on me like I hopped up out a movie
All white everything, winning never losing

I'm a animal
I got my chopper in the trunk and I'mma damage you
I got my niggas in the cut, and they punish you
I got my shooters with the scope, and they aim at you
Cause we some animals
And I'm a animal
I got the chopper in the trunk, and I'mma damage you
I got my niggas in the cut, and they punish you
I got my shooters with the scope, and they aim at you

I done seen drug money flips of property
I done seen close niggas say they robbing me

Been strapped up in them corners, niggas is really informers
I'ma sip lean in the morning, I get the head in the morning

You can't come around, my shooters got a hundred rounds
And they smoking out a lot of pounds
And you rappers still underground

These niggas so serious, my shooters Nigeria
My wrist Siberia, these niggas be fearing us

Slow down and better up, et cetera, et cetera

I just bought the bitch two pairs of Channel
I told her model for Us

Set my mindlike we on that Nigga Ass, ain't no talkin to us
Gimme Compliments my bitch for real, but ain't no talking to her
Champagne Back to Back in the Gucci Store, when I walk through it
Get High then I treat the Mic like Therapy, cuz i talk to it
I sit back and ask myself why so many times
They treatin' sports just like the Streets they tryna give em fines
He in the trenches without a Gun I called and gave him mine
Bump Heads with my Day ones Yesterday, I say ima give em time
Hope B.A. get right back of that time, they gave em 55
I hate Tayski gone forever we locked in on the 59th
He was my dawg, he was my round, he was like 50 twice
I made it out, i beat the odds it gotta be precise
Me and my Auntie had some words that shit ate me alive
See my little Daughter Bad as Hell and She ain't even five
He got the same time as the shooter and he ain't even drive
A O.P.P got his T.O.P and he ain't even die
I seen so many Young Niggas lose they Lives
That's why when I go to a Funeral Today, I dont even cry
And that real shit run in my veins
Some niggas i dont fuck wit for real
They just one of my stains
I put 90 on your head thats one of my chains
And I can't cap that nigga, Von made me go to Johnny Dang
I popped a Pill and Held my Head down and I was feelin' strange
I'm swinging first whenever a nigga ask me what I bang
When You lose 5 Niggas in One Summer, that's when you'll fell my pain
You ain't gotta sntach it they'll kill you, you can't feel my chain
I'm the Highest in the Room, I feel just like la flame
They'll give you life but change to a dub, if you give them names
Yeah...
My Life for real for real, this not a movie
If a nigga I know support my song they'll call em Groupies
And they ain't even me Lil Baby but they'll go post his music
And that's my dawg fa'sho

Now I'm going on some movie shit
All the hitter shit started that

Niggas know what's up with us man
Talking 'bout we don't be out here
Nigga you got us fucked up boy
Man I get shit done boy
You tweakin', yo ass trippin'
Niggas call me Bloodas just like Tee out here (let's get it)
Opps be calling foenem phone, say I don't be out here (L's)
Catch him, knock his noodles back, just don't tweak out here
Foenem slidin', late night huntin', ain't no sleep out here
2 days back to back, that's 50 racks to be out here (on God)
Can't have no fefe on yo block as long as Steve out here
Can't try to slide inside a fish bowl, you got beef out here
Law keep wantin' to get Zoo out the way, they say he a Chief out here (say he a chief out here)
Niggas hoes, they tuck they tails 'cause they be scared
In that Hellcat, on the e-way, off them med's
Say his name inside this song, my bro said I better not say it
Niggas lowkey want that smoke, you do, you better not say it
Get yo ass back in that house, we got FN not 9's (not 9's)
My credit so A1 with killas, I be paying my fines (my fines)
Opps be on my dick in song but I don't pay 'em no mind (pussy)
All them hoes that be with the opps, gang nem broke they spine
All the crackers get robbed for they shit, they buy it back
I keep my Glock in her Chanel, that shit cost 5 racks
All these hoes be goin' for real lowkey, just buy 'em X
He got shot up in his shit, I hear he tryna flex
Never care so much, ran out of Woods, just pass the Dutch
Your homies died, you don't never slide, it ain't adding up
Get caught with a pipe, you out same night, you fed or what?
New opp pack in the air, this gas or what?
He'd still be alive right now, if you niggas ain't gas him up
Give my shortys steamers and guns, I tell them slide for none
Everybody with this gang-gang shit so they ain't dying for none
If she ain't fuckin' the first night, off the rip, I ain't buying her none
If I ain't got time for loving my kids, then I ain't got time for none
Then I slide home to my bitch, that means no time for cuddle
Why these niggas think they safe 'cause they locked in?
Man we thought this shit was over, send some shots then
You think you safe where you at out West? Lil nigga just bopped in
I know some killas from out West, they keep them Glock 10s
Knowing they killa on the loose, it throw my vibe off
You lighting candles on that main street, watch that sad block
You ever stood up over a opp and knocked his dreads off? (I did)
You know a nigga claim he a hate us but he fanned out (let's get it)
Back then I pull up to them clubs, them killas was sitting in the steamers
How the fuck he say he ain't tell, but the court steady throwing that nigga subpoenas
Fuck Lil Durk, he ain't on shit, his ass a singer (what else?)
Fuck Lil Durk, his ass a goofy, he not Lamron either (what else?)
Fuck Lil Durk, he talked to 6ix9ine live about his people (what else?)
Niggas always say they out here, we don't never see them (they lie)
But if we do, we pop out cars, and we gone no I.D them
Lowkey I know they hurt, they hurt so bad, they don't IG it
Jumped off the porch back then, when X was stacks, and smoking mid
69th and Ashland, used to stay right there right by the field
Loco he stayed next door on Bishop, he was selling mid
18 for exotic, in Chiraq sell it 36
I'm not tryna die young out here like I'm Roddy Ricch

I went to school on a daily, and I was totin' my .40
My homie got pounds on pounds
I go his krill like a forest
Askin' can he put me on now, like why you ignoring me
I tell em go pull up a Taurus, at the top shootin' a Taurus
I mix up a 8 and I pour it, I left my feelings in storage
Remember I jumped out the Porsches
You ain't no killa, ain't torch shit
Don't get caught in the mornin'
We catch you, then we scorin’
Wash that blood with chlorine
You say I’m a hoe, you don't know me
I get you touched with no cheese
Gotta watch out cause I’m lowkey
Niggas be cool with the police
I made a dub off 4P, I made a tribe with 4 piece
I went and copped me a rollie

I dun' showed love to these niggas
But I mistreated niggas who gon' rock with me to the end
Forgive me again, just gimme yo hand
Them ain't my friends, y’all my friends
Give me a chance, give me a chance...
Give me one more chance!!!
Give me one more chance!!!
Give me one more chance!!!
Give me one more chance!!!

Man I thought you was my dawg but you tricked me
You tryna play me close but niggas know you out to get me
Should've known when I said ""Nah""
You cut me off that shit was fishy
I trust you with my secrets but you went and told my business
Wanna be on the Forbes with you
I dun' slept on the floors with you
I dun' went to war with you, and we ain't have no pistols
I tell you stories when we both was dirty
When I was broke I was splittin' the perc'y
When I went broke I sold my .30
Could've gone bad, and that shit hurt me
Caught with a gun, that shit was jerky
Caught for a murder, they ain't showin' no mercy
Snake yo blood, that shit ain't worth it
At the same time ain't no one perfect
Went on a hit, that nigga was nervous
But I was blind cause a nigga too thirsty
Caught me a body, I built my courage
Gotta watch out cause my dog was informin'

I dun' showed love to these niggas
But I mistreated niggas who gon' rock with me to the end
Forgive me again, just gimme yo hand

I told my brothers that we blood I don't know who my cousins is
And if you is you hang with them you know what is it
I swear I'd go back to jail for all my brother's kids
I swear I'd go back to jail to see my brothers live
Shoot shoot then file the ambulance make sure you dead for real
Yo' parents rich you sip with spoons my family ain't left a will
And we ain't doin' no sneaky talk they ass had left for real
And why he talkin' out his chest like he a (?) still
Them niggas ain't worried about no shooters they was made to kill
I put my heart inside my music I got pain for real
Justin lost his grandma I got pain for him
Made me call my grandma way more
And since she changed my life I gotta change yours",https://genius.com/Lil-durk-way-more-snippet-lyrics

I'm thumbing through a check until my fingers numb
Streets a motherfucker, can't trust a motherfucker
Niggas be super-bitches, can't spare a crumb for you
Why keep that drug money?
Why keep that plug, homie?
I'm going broke, just pull that plug on me
Life behind bars ain't the same no more
Niggas ain't your niggas, ain't the same no more
Change for $100 ain't no money no more
Niggas ain't starving, they ain't hungry no more

Drugs got parts, my niggas got parts, life behind bars
Introduce me to the streets
Money got parts, in the kitchen cook it hard, and I'm riding in foreign cars
Introduce me to the streets
Introduce me to the streets (to the streets, to the streets)
Introduce me to the streets
Introduce me to the streets (to the streets, to the streets)
Introduce me to the streets
Introduce me to the streets (to the streets, to the streets)

227K,I’m a Hitta,2018.0,"300 bulldogs, you know we run in packs
Don't need to ask for niggas, they tell us where they at
No hidin' and seek, sedentary where you at
Even the blind can lead y'all where we at
Why y'all sneak dissin' and hatin' on the guys
Nigga you bitch made, a pussy in disguise
You read the resume, you mustn't remind
The shit you do, your own guys say you're lyin'
Chillin' on 64th, don't smoke so I lean
Choppers and handguns, got dope for the fiends
I don't need everybody to tell me what I need
Fuck yo' guys, pussy, Lamron we the team
Word got back that y'all only wanna diss
Half of the niggas you roll with don't want this
I'm a hitta by myself, you can ask the bricks
2-4-14 the niggas I roll with

I'm not a hitta
Somebody lied, I got two 40s for them niggas
I got two 40s for them niggas
I got two 40s for them niggas
I am a monster like it's October 31st
Roll up with the 9 and hit the niggas where it hurt
If I die today, remember me like King Davie
Buried Lil Moe, and this to tell him that we made it, hah

Lil Durk, nigga
DD wanna get him
I tell bro just wait and that I'mma hit him
He think he king cause he got a couple pawns with him
He think he hot cause he keep a couple frauds with him
Bang
I think he need God with him
The Lam on him so I think he got some gods with him
Okay, okay, we drinkin' Rozay
Bullet holes and IVs with this gunplay
2011, everybody think they killas now
I call Murda, all them hittas down in D-town
Some boonie moe got locked up, he think he chief now
Until I call a couple drillas from the East Side, L's

I'm not a hitta
Somebody lied, I got two 40s for them niggas
I got two 40s for them niggas
I got two 40s for them niggas
I am a monster like it's October 31st
Roll up with the 9 and hit the niggas where it hurt

Lil Durk verse_
""Smoke opps out in vegas, 20 a show and these niggas can't take us\
40 ruger leave a nigga wit' face lift
RIP Pluto me and him on a space ship, told bentley don' put me in the weight list
I just cop me a chop but that nina my fragrance
Roc gotta mop he addicted to maitenence
No barber but bro nem' be taping
Fly in that ? wit' that steamer wit' k's
I got the axe and i throw up the tre'
I'm getting money I'm stuck in my ways
Bitch, you ain't me, cause i gotta get paid
Niggas be talkin' i got shooters like Ray
Slide in the morning do a drill no Sway
Wanted his head gotta watch fo' the jakes
Niggas they bitch, they chill fo' the cake
But these bitch ass niggas so fake""
Nuski verse_
""These niggas be fake gotta watch em'
Im hot, so i know they plottin'
Go broke, have lil bro rob em'
That nina my problem solver
Man down, no shells revolver
At the top but i gotta go harder
I like my lean a lil darker
Bullet holes, same sound as Ms.Parker
My squad they stay on dummy
Get back if you ain't get no money
YSL got me straight stunin
I'm strapped you tweak i'm upping
Cash out, make it back it's nothing
Red spots on his face no blushing
These guns, they burning like usher
My shooters gon' score to buss em'""
Lil Durk verse_
""Niggas get clapped bout' rap
War time no twitter but a nigga get clout
Clout Boyz, beg for a diss to get clout
Do a hit on 4-6, catch a opp then we out
Ring cost 30, but the watch cost 50
Ask french, cuz he got at the same place fo' like 50
Free 5, tryna give bro 5 thats 50
Then we slide wit the 50, free 9 no 50
And we coolin' wit foreign
Bang Bro yo' bitch no porn
Just made a hunnit' off touring
Free Rio, damn 23 like jordan

""put a drum in a nickel
Shootas on point, and they aiming official
Blowing that tech like a ref wit' a whistle
My niggas they thirsty don't pick up you dribble
Want war we got missiles

Bitch i'm the shit, i'm allergic to tissue
We savage, not civil
Get money no issue
Only the family cuz' niggas ain't witchu'
Feelin' my self, cuz' i copped the new pistol
Aiki gon' blow, Rex toting on the low
Bottle lens fo' the scope
Guns cocked for a roach
Take em' down for the coke
Remy got it in his coat
Pound and lean, roll da' dope
These niggas dont tote
Yall niggas won't blow

We gon' sleep around each other 'til we neighbor, uh

You cheat on me, I swear I'll beat you like you stole somethin'

Stayed ahead you know go nigga
Can't hold on with no rope nigga so stay strong and keep hope nigga
I spit raw with no coke nigga, L's up for my bro nigga, L's up for Lil moe nigga

Keep it real, I was only 13 playing in the field
Got caught with a 30 slammer, keep the heat to see a mil
Friends hating on me plotting on me for a couple bills
They say I'ma lose my deal but I say that's motivation
Crazy how I grew up with you, tell me whats the point of hating
You say you gon' kill me then, tell me what's the point you making
Cut the dreads, use to tell the bitches I was part Jamaican
Love you and I miss you Tayski, you gon' cry when you see me make it, L's",https://genius.com/Lil-durk-outro-life-aint-no-joke-lyrics

Certified street nigga, but I ain't trying to preach nigga
To any nigga, rich nigga
Mack on repeat, I stay to snaking these niggas
They aim and they plot
I can't relate, these niggas bitches they fake
No love do a drill, east side when we drill

Taking me away
I know what you did, don’t wanna hurt no more
Even though you took me through some hell
Been through worse before
Like why you put me last
I put you first before
You was with me when I was Tay-Tay now I’m Durkio
Put me in my place when I’m in the wrong
You make me mad, I’m throwing dirt up in yo name in songs
Back then started hate me when I was born
You keep on arguing, imma send you home (go now)
Bitch I’m just like Nino but no snitching on me
Got that Gucci peacoat, yeah that shit is golden
In the fontainebleau, gotta room getting head til’ the morning
Put my Gucci socks up in yo mouth you keep on moaning
Got a B.I.T.C.H I can’t fuck no groupies
Its certain shit I can’t do, something like Scooby
The way she wear them boy shorts, she be seducing
I don’t wanna buy no Rollie, imma buy her Rubies
Take her to the crib, Benihana’s, movies
All this ass shit, don’t really ever move me
Everytime I pop a perc, I lose it movie

Give me head, give me sex, give me coochie

He not dead, he incarcerated I still love him
Can’t be sitting up on my ass & you hungry, gotta hustle
Told me chill on that gangsta shit, baby it’s cool to cuddle
I’m in that jungle, so this lifestyle gotta juggle
And if I love you, it’s for you, it ain’t about no money
I can be fucking, I get up & touch yo tummy
Touch yo tummy, whole boy bump inside yo stomach (my baby)

He had to move around cause I know he was jealous
Got all them guns like that nigga really actin'
Why you front your move? Choppa make you move backwards
And you showed the streets your word don't matter, yeah yeah

Want the Money,ChiLanta 2,2016.0,"Can't nothing beat the failure but a try
Well I'm trying to get me some money

I just want the money baby, I just want the money
I just want the money baby, I just want the money

Run it up then I fuck on every bitch that I like
All she wanted was two hunna
Bricks in the fender, bags in the trunk of the Honda
That bitch ain't goin' chasing that money
No I'm not new to this money
I'm so consistent with thumbing
Trap that bitch spot before she get a single buck
That O.J. Mayo like I play for the Bucks
Slam dunking from the A to the Gump
Good clean came in, went and criss crossed them
Hit with the beater watch it come back
You ain't seen a nigga face in the trap in a while
Must've thought I fucked up ain't coming back
I send my shooters come in back-to-back
That's just because of my social status
Bitch mad that a nigga hit the trap all night
Ain't got the time to get the groceries baby
They pull up to the trap like vultures
Longway consistent in motion
Watching the pack just scatter like roaches
The spot on Beta XXX, beat it down, got ghost
I just want the money baby, I just want the money
I just want the money baby, I just want the money

Ain't a blood, I do still bleed

Masks on for them cameras
On my own no advances
Broken homes for advances

Ditched school hit the hood

Starving, crib full of family I can't sleep without balling
So I watch D Rose play (often)
Aunty died from cancer so I rap to keep the laugh
I'd rather pray when I'm alone instead of giving shit to pastors
Daddy gone since I was a in pampers
He get out when I'm in pampers
Old and a dead man, hand still on the hammer
Niggas talking 'bout they my mans and we friends
Where you was you at when that man with that lanz offered me ten?
Shackled up, with the niggas that we hit with the fan
Eating shit that we gathered in blan
President still black, I hope he change shit
Niggas out here fifty, doing the same shit
When he say he got my back he ran quick
Don't judge me
I know the streets love me

Half them killers told on em
Had my chopper and road with em

I can't snitch on a nigga pillow talking to ops and hoes bitch of a nigga
Summer nights, all them drugs made me kill shit
I lost so many niggas if they die I don't feel shit
Been on IG with me man, just to feel rich
Them niggas who snaked, I kept it real with it

Robbing wall mart was a thing to me
Living behind them apartments showed me i had enemies
Had to give up a little  bit of money because people trying to rob me
I don’t give a fuck about you
I'll turn you to a quick duck sauce too
Play with me about my money i dare you
Rolling dice on them late nights on them corner blocks
I got so much money i can take off
Cut the prices of my birds there feathers in the coop
Trying to buy that new bend coop
Got fired from last job as a clerk
Found out my baby mama was cheating on me

Deep end,UnKnown,UnKnown,"She's only 17, her whole life's ahead of her
She hates school because the people there discredit her
Her boyfriend tries to show her that's not how it seems
But everyday she just gets lowered with her self-esteem
He let's her know that every night will have a brighter day
She even tried to overdose and take her life away
She's feeling hopeless there just sitting down beside her bed
Then he takes his hand and places it beside her head
He tries to hold her but with every touch she still resists
And then he sees the scars that bury deep within her wrists
She's feeling numb, he tries to beg and plead and ask her, ""Why?""
She says this way she has control of the pain she feels inside
He's asking her, ""How long it's going since you've felt this?
Way because you got me here, just feeling so damn helpless.""
She says, ""It's been a while. I guess I needed better luck.""
And then he screams at her and tells her, ""Baby, never cut!""
Nobody seems to get you, you feel you're on your own
But listen, pretty lady, you don't have to be alone
So, baby, don't cut
Baby, don't cut
You can do anything, just promise baby you won't cut
I know your heart is hurting, you think the road has end
You may just feel that blade you're holding is your only friend
But baby don't cut, baby don't cut
You can do anything, just promise baby you won't cut
The next day at school she's feeling better than the day before
Even cracked a couple smiles as she walked the corridor
But all that seemed to end: she dropped her books when she walked into class
And every student in the room just seemed to point and laugh
She couldn't take it anymore, she sent her boy a text
She said, ""I love you with my body, heart and soul to death.""
He thought nothing, typed ""I love you"", then he sent it
By ""death"" he didn't know that she had literally just meant it
She ducked the next class, ran home into the bathroom
Thought to herself she wouldn't break her promise that soon
One cut... two cuts... three cuts... four
The blood just started dripping from the tub to the floor
Her boyfriend had a feeling in his stomach that he hated
He followed it right down to her house he never waited
The front door was open, he heard the water running
He stormed into the bathroom and his heart just started gunning
Nobody seems to get you, you feel you're on your own
But listen pretty lady you don't have to be alone
So baby don't cut
Baby don't cut
You can do anything, just promise baby you won't cut
I know your heart is hurting, you think the road has end
You may just feel that blade you're holding is your only friend
But baby don't cut, baby don't cut
You can do anything, just promise baby you won't cut
He puts her arm around his shoulder, he's just tryna lean her back up
Yelling out her name as he lays her beside the bathtub
Feels his whole world just took a hit from a big avalanche
Screaming out so heavily, ""Somebody call an ambulance!""
Feeling mad angry like somebody's led her onto this
Her eyeballs are rolling, drifting out of consciousness
Thinking to himself why the hell did she just stop at will
The tears just keep on rolling as they head to the hospital
Paramedics rush her in, the doctor calls emergency
She's lost a lot of blood the place looks like a murder scene
An hour later, the doc walks over with a sour face
And says, ""Excuse me for the words that I'm about to say
I'm sorry for your loss, "" the boy just starts collapsing
His own world, his own girl just took a crashing
Saying to himself that it's his fault and that he let it up
""Baby, I thought you made a promise you would never cut.""
Nobody seems to get you, you feel you're on your own
But listen pretty lady you don't have to be alone
So baby don't cut
Baby don't cut
You can do anything, just promise baby you won't cut
I know your heart is hurting, you think the road has end
You may just feel that blade you're holding is your only friend
But baby don't cut
, baby don't cut
You can do anything, just promise baby you won't cut",https://genius.com/Lil-durk-deep-end-lyrics

Pull up on the opps, I'ma hit 'em with the double drum
Watch them niggas huddle up, scary with the bubble guts

They look at you different if you was a criminal
Rich in the trenches then that shit a miracle
Killers the killers the robbers that's fearin' you
I done seen niggas go snitch on an interview
Got called for a murder now that nigga spiritual
Time went on and I ain't sit wit you
Why you tell the police what I did with you?
Why you tell my bitch what I did with you?
