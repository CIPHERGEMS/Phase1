Deja Vu (Uptown Baby),Make It Reign,1998.0,"New York to the heart, but got love for all
Lie and die in the fire, where I learned to ball
Uptown is the place where I lay my dome
On the streets of the Bronx where my family roam
Ho damn it, we home, Peter got a nine millimeter
Playa haters can feel the flame from my heater
I never really liked to play a fool like that
But I love to succeed and see foes fall flat
Splat, like deja vu
And I got another clip that'll daze y'all crew
I sip Cristal, Dom P, Mo' with pist-al
Just cause I'm pissy, don't mean you should misdoubt
Keep em near da fifties and, hundreds all arranged
Anything less than that, you keep the change
Not filthy rich, but bitch I'm barely broke
Blessed with flows that keep you hooked like dope
Friends call me Gunz, sons call me trife
Cause I'm quick to slide off and slide this dick up in your wife
And that's life, you should learn how to treat her
I guarantee Peter, knows how to eat her
And beat her, niggas in the Bronx call me Lex
Cause I push a Lex, and I rock a Rolex
And I lounge on Lex, and I love sex
And I wave techs on sets that be tryin to flex
Like Dex, nigga God rest your soul
But when you're playin cards for Gunz, it ain't no time to fold

New York niggas got crazy game
But outta town niggas is all the same
Brooklyn niggas get crazy loot
That's because when it's beef they ain't scared to shoot
Harlem niggas know how to play
Mack the 600, getting crazy pay
Niggas outta Queens got shit on lock
Strapped with the Glock, running up in your spot

But if it wasn't for the Bronx
This rap shit probably never would be going on
So tell me where you from
(Uptown baby, uptown baby
We gets down baby, up for the crown baby)
Now if it wasn't for the Bronx
This rap shit probably never would be going on
So tell me where you from
(Uptown baby, uptown baby
We gets down baby, up for the crown baby)

Yo the RM-80, is parked in the lot
Right next to the Mercedes, keep the heat cocked
For these blocks that are shady, you're crazy if you walk around
Thinking shit's gravy; stop me? Maybe
I'm livin life lawless, makin big investments
On them 8-class flawless, and hoes call us
I'm comfortable like Recaro, two quarters of my life
Walkin roads type narrow, deep thoughts which I abide by
Puffin high, got my mind's eye, points sharper
Than an arrow gettin high, keep your eye on the sparrow
Riches like the pharaoh, bought a new five
With the snitches for these hoes, trunk full of ammo
Keep my toast closer than most niggas keep they own shadow
And I strap for my foes like a saddle
I rock stones, other niggas rock gravel
Talk shit? Whatever have you, I'm from Soundview
Bronx most wanted, front get confronted
Playa, we rollin deep in the one point five hundreds
Like Big I., red eyed, mad blunted
You step outside and get blooded have your whole block flooded
With the Bronx it's a warnin, stormin guns out
From dusk 'til dawn and it's on, no doubt
Keep a eye on yo' bitch when I'm roamin about
And put a eye on yo' lip nigga, watch yo' mouth
I'm from the Bronx, wipe yo' feet when you step in my house
Cause you's a small-time nigga, bout a half an ounce now

New York niggas got crazy game
But outta town niggas is all the same
Brooklyn niggas get crazy loot
That's because when it's beef they ain't scared to shoot
Harlem niggas know how to play
Mack the 600, getting crazy pay
Niggas outta Queens got shit on lock
Strapped with the Glock, running up in your spot

But if it wasn't for the Bronx
This rap shit probably never would be going on
So tell me where you from
(Uptown baby, uptown baby
We gets down baby, up for the crown baby)
Now if it wasn't for the Bronx
This rap shit probably never would be going on
So tell me where you from
(Uptown baby, uptown baby
We gets down baby, up for the crown baby)

Cross Bronx Expressway,Make It Reign,1998.0,"Yea, yea, one more time
Seventies shit, got the lean
Shit is leanin, it's to the left
It's just leanin, dribblin
Like he gave it a bag of dugy
Or a bag of that Tango and Cash
It's just leanin and shit, seventies (The Lord Tariq)
Aiyyo I been through many places
Done many things
Seen the eyes of many faces
From New York to Texas
To the faces on Rolexes
Not a racist or sexist
And the best is the Lord, none the less is Gunz
Nothin less than a Lexus
Bubble eye with V-V-S's
Trouble minds and troubled times
Stacks, I'm tryin to double mine
I'm in a six wit double dimes and a couple of nines
Me and tracks back to back, circle the block a couple of times
And we searchin for this nigga to try
I'm bubblin mine
If we don't get him now then we will in due time
I bust enough shots to kill him two times, I do crimes
I get caught then my mind's defined in my son's rhymes
Cause my thoughts stay runnin like thugs from one-time
I been through it under the influence
Bustin off I'm runnin into it
See me say he didn't do it
Put the nine to his mind and blew it
Cause some times I lose it give me a gun and I'll abuse it
Puffin with my family, my bitch, my money or my music
Makin killas say he's too sick when he do shit
But I'm on some new shit, and it's too late the fuse lit
I treat my nine like a new bitch
And the shit do kick, word

I'm on the Cross Bronx with Fat Joe and my man
On the East side of town wit a blunt in my hand
Soundview, Monroe, Castle Hill, Bronx Dale
Rose Dale, Academy, Lafeyette, Cozy
I'm on the Cross Bronx with Fat Joe and my man
On the East side of town wit a blunt in my hand
Commonwealth, Theriott, White Plains, Randall
Omestead, Bointain, Colgate, Watson

Play rap loud, politickin business
Wit the crack crowd, fact file, funny how I never seen a rat smile
My last trial's one of the reasons why I rap now
But still could blaow any nigga actin irrational
Fuckin with me's worse than duckin police
After puffin some trees I'll probably be abductin your niece
Murderin beats since the days of permanent crease
Been around the block seen grams converted to keys
Aah Cartagena, breaks hearts in Argentine
My misses slugs to love me, my wife act like Anita
Terror Squad'll die for the cause even if it means blowin up things
And takin over City Hall
My shit is raw straight from the Panama shores
If the feds can't catch me then they make up a law
Can't take it no more, niggas is fake to the core
My state pen friends'll leave you broke and naked up north
Bet it all on the Terror Squad click from Forrest
Real Bronx niggas that's heartless that spark shit
Regardless, niggas shouldn't have tried that shit
That's why mothafuckas gotta die like this

I'm on the Cross Bronx with Gunz my man
On the South side of town wit a brick in my hand
Forrest, Melrose, McKinley, the boulevard, Washington
Patterson, Courtland
I'm on the Cross Bronx with Gunz my man
On the South side of town wit a brick in my hand
Brook Ave., Cryprus, Hunt's Point, Saint John, Little Vil
Trinity, Creston, Walton

I had a dream that a team had a scheme keepin the beam
On my head like a infrared he's dead, but I redeem
Now I'm back nigga, it's on nigga
Run nigga, Joe nigga, Pun nigga, Lord nigga
Gunz motherfuckers ain't really knowin I'm really goin
And feelin I'm showin that my main objective is Benz and Lexuses
Cop Rolexeses, get bigot in Texases
So fierce bitches they be callin me exorcist
Far from a devil, Im God I mean I'm Gunz
And I shine like sun, rhyme like none, find my gun
Got beef with this nigga with hits and shit
Chips and shit, run around here switchin shit
Tellin people don't play that, you gotta play this
Tellin crew you ain't sayin that, you gotta say this
You can't wear that, you gotta wear this
Well hear this, I'll go in yo chest and leave you earless, fearless
The only thing between us if you stop my cream
Is a Glock nineteen, and I'mma pop like steam
Tryin to stop me and mine from eatin you need a doctor
With a hundred gauze pads nigga to stop you from leakin
And a prayer from the deacon as you weaken
And words from the Funkmaster Flex dogs shouldn't have been reachin
There's only one Gunz, from what it's worth
That's me, that's it, buryin shit, right in the earth

I'm on the Cross Bronx with Big Pun and my man
On the West side of town with a gun in my hand
174th, Vyse Ave, Bryant, Longfellow, Ho Ave

On the West side of town with a gun in my hand
Lambert, Tremont, Concourse, Jerome Ave
3rd Ave, Ogden, Webster, Simpson

Yo we the Bronx avengers, partners in these peelan adventures
We the monster niggas in your dreams
That be stompin ya senseless, so be consciencious
If you march against us I'mma call my gentas
And you nondescripters gonna have to face the consequences
We large percentage and you small change
Hittin niggas long range
Chrome gauge leavin niggas John Blaze
Crime pays if you nice with yours
The Bronx is where you fight for yours
Ice your cross, slice cigars, light cigars
All day, wildin, freestylin in the hallways
Broadway ain't got more drama than Watson off of Colgate
This ain't the old days shorties is bustin, ain't no fuckin jokin
Some nigga called me a German, I had to bust him open
My brothers holdin me down with heavy artillery
Chevys and Willys' be chilin in front of every facility
Joeys from Trinity so he reps Forrest
You could save the best for us
But you still better place your bets on us
The Bronx baby, where the best get blown
My restin zone, come on nigga test your throne
I'm blessed with chrome, so leave your vest at home
I don't aim for the chest bitch, strictly necks and domes

I'm on the Cross Bronx with uh three of my mens
Runnin up in your spot with a mack in my hand
Pure energy, checkmate, Blue Thunder, Obsession
Pulp Fiction, Purple Rain, Punisher, South side
I'm on the Cross Bronx with uh three of my mens
Runnin up in your spot with a mack in my hand

Make it Reign,Make It Reign,1998.0,"It took a long time, you're sittin' and you wonder though
These niggas said they was comin' in a month or so
But they frontin' though
Are they really out here, on all this rain and thunder shit?
They be talkin' this, hocus-pocus, focus
On the miracle, lyrical content
From the Bronx to Compton, sayin' nonsense
Hit the CD, stay sober, listen to it, smoke a blunt
Listen again, it sound different to you? Gettin' to you?
Don't be alarmed, side-effects is normal
And I'm a MD, not a MC
Step ahead of that, instead of that, shit in your Walkman
You singin', I, give you somethin' you could bounce to and think about
Not the same crew, with the same lou
On the same rhyme, get your step on, education at the same time
When you play mine, it'll bite you like a K-9, obey mine
Like Sprite nigga, get it right nigga, with the right nigga
With the tight, for the calm shit, it be bomb shit
Everyday, all day, his way, y'all way
Leave you in the hallway, the floorway, the 4-4 way
When you call me, be for me, not against me

Lord, uh, uh, uh...

Yo, L-o-r-d yo Gunz the block scarred me
Got me smokin' more than Bob Marley
A soft nigga, hardly. Stress me, wanna step to me
And test me? Strap your best to be, 'cause I'ma bless heat
Underestimatin' he, who takes the cake and weed?
Lord & Gunz, see the '44 then run, 'cause there's more to sure
To come
Blastin' all you niggas, quick fast, I'm harassin' all you niggas
Laugh at all you niggas, bust a cap in all you fake, rapper actor
Wannabe, thug must wanna see, slug nigga whaa?!
I'm from Soundview, I'll pound you, down, to the ground
Til' the earth shake, the earthquake and the best is the first to make
Platinum, what's happenin'?
Soft he or nuthin', sweet here, there's no slappin', the name is everlastin'
I'm Ramadan fastin', with a passion
I'm askin', give me mine, or get the 9
See me on the street, you got beef and wanna get me? Fine

We Will Ball,Make It Reign,1998,"Intro:  Peter Gunz
Feel it, feel it
Coma ona, come on
DA, DA, DA
Where ya at(where ya at)
Yo
Verse 1:  Peter Gunz & Lord Tariq
I'm too hot to handle, too cold to freeze
Rice the illest shit & don't smoke no trees
Niggas won't test, but they turn around & freeze
Might get mic cancer the way I smoke m.c.s
Nigga we did it all from flippin burgs to manipulating words
Gettin less than four Os on a check is absurd
I got the five it's feasible, but the six is preferred
So when I step, you better have my shit corrrect, ya heard
I'm in the ruber in the sand, gettin a tan playin frisbee
With this quarter piece, sippin on coladas gettin dizzy
On the celly with my broker buyin shares of stock
Cause when it stops, I'ma still be sittin in drops
And I'm in a benz, comin through, doin two, pumpin lilo
Bought the cut jewels from Tif, cause the feds are watchin Tito
Stepped up from an eigth, to a half, to a kilo
To makin mils, off this label deal, that's for real
Yo
Chorus:  Peter Gunz & Lord Tariq
PG:	We will ball
LT:	Until my lady shoppin at Sach's
And got the minx on they back, I tell ya
PG:	We won't fall
LT:	Until my players on the block doin it
And gettin money in stacks, I tell ya
PG:  	We will ball
LT:  	Ladies with the pedicures
Manicures & they hair done up, I tell ya
PG:  	We won't fall
LT:	And players ride around in V's
Pumpin our cd's, just turn it up
Verse 2:  Peter Gunz & Lord Tariq
I didn't ball with the best of them
Fuck the rest of them
Chickenheads don't mess with them
Dimes ain't even stressin em
It's all about franc & pounds & dinero
The same shit that helped me get my six-zero-zero
Nigga we ball, we take it all never dealin we fresh
Talk jewels like I had my tongue dipped in platinum
Tanqueray get me wet, I'm drippin in activator
Drop the top on the porsche, hit the clutch see you later
Well I tried to tell my P-O, screamed on the C-O
Before I turn 3-O, I'll be C-E-O
Young black millionaire, why you still in there
Checkin asses, harass just some herb with the bashes
If gettin money's a crime, well then I'm guilty as charged
Filthy rich, Lord built to be large
I'll have the city sick
Pullin that silver shit out the garage
Under the sun with yo chick gettin a massage
Chorus
Verse 3:  ?, Peter Gunz, & Lord Tariq
Well these bitches tryin to sleep on me
Wop
You shouldn't sign these niggas down they suckin d
Drop
And now they wanna sweat cause we double p
Stop
Got the nerve to call my office for a free cd
Cop
Man they said we couldn't do it but we it's done
And they said we wouldn't win but we won
They said it would be better if we run
(together)
But we ran to the top of the charts
Platinum plaques when this rap shit was fallin apart
Well she mention little Gunz, Tariq
Staring good, take a taste, fix yo face bitch, ain't nothin sweet
We just tryin to eat, the Bronx applyin the heat
You estimate a hundred thou, we sold 5 in a week

Be My Lady (Bonus Track),Make It Reign,1998,"I can't wait 'til you get home
Just can't wait 'til you get home
I can just hear it, yeah
Somebody, somebody, somebody calling me (Be my lady)
I can just hear it
Somebody, somebody, somebody calling me (Be my lady)

Yo, I seen ya E-Class in through the block in your silver 320
No tint, flashing to the world you got a few pennies
With an S Class face and a slight beige complexion
Give me memories of me and you sexin'
So I stepped in, less than, a minute or so
I saw your eyes on my 6, yo, get in and we go
Her shit is good, yeah I know because I hit it before
But it's the walk that got me still feelin this hoe
I offered the world and ya still politely tellin me 'No'
You cut it short, said you didn't like me sellin that blow
I only do what I know, these streets raised me, pays me
With you in my life it's all gravy, maybe, a trip to the islands
Wildin' in the sun and you ask, why should I?
You be smilin' for one, huh
I gets the job done in more ways than one
Grow old and maybe raise a son, so, let me know, huh?
1-	
	What's it gonna take to get next to you?
	Tell you some good shit and have sex with you
	Show you ain't nothin' about me shady
	And I'd love it if you'd be my lady
	What's it gonna take to get next to you?
	Tell you some good shit and have sex with you
	Show you ain't nothin' about me shady
	And I'd love it if you'd be my lady

Shorty, I remember back when I seen you with your crew
And they was hatin', cock blockin' cuz they knew I wanted you
They would tell you that I dog girls and all that shit
And you was just another chick that I wanted to hit
And it was true, I ran through many, didn't love any
And the thug in me made me dog many
But now I see my playin' days is over
I'd like to take this time out to finally get to know ya
A lot of things I wanna show ya
You say you're not impressed with my money and fame
And it's crazy how you say I make my money in vain
Cuz I talk about guns and drugs, hoes and thugs
Don't ya know that your music shows no love?
But I rap what I see; for instance
Won't you cut the clown cat that ya seein' and come chat with me
We can sit in the six and make plans
And talk about the steps I gotta take
Honey, to be your man, c'mon
Repeat 1

2-	
	C'mon, babe
	C'mon, baby
	I said c'mon, girl
	Be my lady
	C'mon, babe

My Time to Go,Make It Reign,1998,"You know what they say
God forgives all sins
Except suicide
Then I guess I'll be a'ight
'cause I ain't gon' kill myself
You know
I was raised atheist, God was a myth
Never prayed 'cause I never seen, and I was never with
Kneelin' on my knees, just thankin' Jesus
For stuff that I received when I wasn't receivin'
It's like
Thanks for the lights that ain't on
Thanks for the food that's gone
And my stomach's tight empty
Thanks for the clothes that ya sent me
They tight and kids laugh, so I be cuttin' school, a'ight
I wanna thank you for my brother smokin' crack
I also wanna thank you for my cousin gettin' shot in his back
I wanna thank you for my friends that's gone
I mean they all under thirty right, but life goes on
I wanna thank you for my moms being sad
Thanks for the house with the swimming pool I never had
I wanna thank you for my Uncle Bill, smart enough to get his PhD
He got HIV
I wanna thank you for my pops, what a joke
Work hard all of his life and got nothin' to show
I wanna thank you for the lives that you moved
I also wanna thank you for the cancer that you gave E-Smooth
And I'm sorry my belief is low, can you tell me where to go
Heaven or hell, eleven to twelve
And I'm ready when you ready, just tell me don't breath
Will you forgive me 'cause I didn't believe?
All I know is that...

When it's my time to go
All I wanna know
Am I gonna see him or see you?
Give me a clue, tell me what to do
Will you open the gates or am I through
Forgive me for my negatvie thoughts and all my sins
From what I know now Lord I wish I knew then
I seen alot of bad, never had reason to beleive
Now I simply thank you for this air that I breath

Yo, you know people used to say this kid's really crazy
That religion and forgivin' church stuff never fazed me
Livin' off the word of a teacher
My friends up the block gettin' fat sellin' crack to the preacher
Johova's witness says he witnessed, but he never seen
What he seeks is forever green, and he forever fiend
I used to hit the mas now and then
Me and X used to bill with these guys that was five percent
But see, one thing I learned in life being hard
Is no matter who you serve in life, there's one God
Wether you're black or white, Chinese, Japanese
You breath the same air I breath, bleed the same blood I bleed
That's why I'm sayin' you're wrong
If you're sayin' my song is blasphomy, just ask of me
I got God in me just like an artery
If I offended you then pardon me
The things I seen in life hardened me
Wanna treat the next man like a slave
And go to church shoutin', holy ghostin' and
Claimin' you're saved
Then you think because the offer that you gave, you forgivin'
But you better fix the life that you're livin'
You wanna be God-filled, steady sinnin', change your ways
'cause you know it's really money that you praise
It's time to wake up, drop yo' blunt and put away the beer
'cause I'm feelin' like the last days is here
For real


Forgive me Lord
For I have sinned
And now I know
I know you exist

Massive Heat,Make It Reign,1998.0,"Uh
(PG)

I walk holdin' my balls about an inch from the wall
Keep bitches hypnotized as if my name was Biggie Smalls
Your girl's a dime dipper, nigga keep her head locked
Trust Gunz with your wife? Motherfucker bet not
Sleep on Peter G, please don't ever doubt it
From here to New Orleans, I'll improve da 'bout it 'bout it
From the days of doin' Michael, to the days of bein' jailed
Clash with the thoughts that kept my fresh mind stale

Now, who you know, with a New York flow
That keeps a broad respect from California like I'm
Snoop Doggy Dogg?

Well, I'm Pete gunny Gunz
For plenty ammo ammo
Shove this pipe in yo wife
And watch her voice hit soprano
I got rhymes, cock nine
Just shits not a gimmick
That nigga that raps about it
But he'd do it in a minute
Got schemes that'll break yo wealth
Break yo health
You see me comin' nigga
Just, break yourself, (break yourself)
Got Bronx Tales like De Niro
The girl call me, ""Hero""
Bust her kids in the mouth in a 15-0-0
Playas play on
Hatas hate on
Put my weight on
Hit yo bitch off
And then I skate on
Lay on, me and my man lawless
Too broad, for you niggas to fuck with
Niggas can't touch this
Try to rush this?
Fuck out of here... (you know what I'm sayin'?)

This is for my niggas holdin' down the street
Sellin' drums hand to hand under massive heat
'Cause a nigga got to do what he gots to do
So if you that type of nigga, then this shit's for you
All my gun slingin' niggas from L.A. to New York
Who ain't havin' it, let the pistols spray then we talk
'Cause a nigga got to do what he gots to do
So if you that type of nigga then this shit's for you

You just a facsimile
You 'bout to get that ass taxed
This is simple
And beat with bats
I got a little somethin' somethin'
For all you cats
And all you fleas
And all MC's, (all y'all)
Midnight dark
Cock back the spark
It starts sparkin'
Til' everything's dark
And I know where them niggas is at
There they go
Gettin' hit like, ""Where the homies at?
Where they go?""
Yeah nigga
Y'all left alone in the zone
Where heads are flown back
Both blown then it's on
We're terrorists, governmental
Tight and gigantic
Titanium, subterraneum
Titanic, it's all loose
Vanish and run 'em down, (what?!)
Peter gunnin' 'em down
Full pound, full round
Tariq, snatch the pockets of his pants
Rob a fringah, (what?!)
That's what you get
For fucking with niggas with
Sticky Fingaz, (yeah, yeah)
I thought about it (uhuh?)
And naw, I don't doubt it
Might get us
But don't fuck with us

Gunz (7x)
Movin' and groovin'
And showin' *fades*
Ay yo I blast in the door
Everybody get the fuck down
Anybody move is gettin' bucked down
Kurupt pull the truck round
Blindfold gag these niggas
Grab these niggas
They move, bodybag these niggas
That's when they start bitchin'
Like, ""He said it"", and ""He said it""
What the funny shit about it? (yo)
They both gettin' deaded (hah!)
Where you headed?
It's a lot fish
You might see the Titanic
It is gigantic
But you're dead nigga
In five minutes

Ay yo, I bust him in his mouth
I give a new meaning to
""Bite the bullet""
If he flinch, I won't think
I react, and just pull it
Got the tank 22, full clip
Cock back into yo neck
Silly you
I'm killin' you
You gettin' blessed by the L-O
Say hello, to my big partner
Yo with this heavy metal
I'ma rock ya
I clear yo fuckin' block ya, bring your guns
Ya bring your goons
And I'm killin' all 9 of y'all motherfuckers

This is for my niggas holdin' down the street
Sellin' drums hand to hand under massive heat
'Cause a nigga got to do what he gots to do
So if you that type of nigga, then this shit's for you
All my gun slingin' niggas from L.A. to New York
Who ain't havin' it, let the pistols spray then we talk
'Cause a nigga got to do what he gots to do
So if you that type of nigga then this shit's for you

Ay yo I see 9 niggas
I got 9 shots, I gots to stay low
Niggas know me, from
Robbin' spots
Better get my rec on
I got my vest on
My shit is reinforced
Thick enough to stop Teflon
They got about a key
In the corner
They sittin' in a 3
In a quarter
Unaware of the manslaughter
So I approach the man
The keys to the cars, cash and coke
""Get the fuck on the floor
Or get smoked!"" motherfucker!
Starin' at the trees on my trucker
Jumped in the 3, I hit a bruptner
I must'a been doin' about 80
Some niggas gave chase in a Mercedes
I'm laughin', (hahaha!)
My nine start blastin'
Six to the chest
For being swift with the tongue
High-strung, now you use a garbage bag for a lung
You can't fuck with a gun
I've been in this game since '81
Lord Tariq, Peter Gunz, y'all done

This is for my niggas holdin' down the street
Sellin' drums hand to hand under massive heat
'Cause a nigga got to do what he gots to do
So if you that type of nigga, then this shit's for you
All my gun slingin' niggas from L.A. to New York
Who ain't havin' it, let the pistols spray then we talk

Givin' 'em slight pain for brain you might gain
Above the weather no hail, sleet, rain

Who Am I,Make It Reign,1998,"Verse 1: Lord Tariq
What, Yo-yo-yo-yo
I'm broken down from keys to oz's to grams
And being sold in city blocks moving hand to hand
Who am I?
You can find me on a corner of your block
And I'm boning powder-forming transform into a rock
Who am I?
I suck the life out of a nigga put your dick in the sand
I'm transported through borders for grams
So who am I?
Small and white like shining so bright
Might take your son's life in the middle of the night
Who am I?
Chopped down a hundred packs for hundred stacks
And I'm sold through a hole through the wall
I'm controlling you all
So who am I?
My pipe game is wicked
And an hour get you by and it can be kinda fitted
Who am I?
I might last for five minutes, but that's all right
Because that 25 Mitch will get you high all night
So who am I? I'm born to kill blacks
And I'm made in the U.S. I'm known as crack
Chorus 1: Lord Tariq
So who am I?
Very small, and I stashed in walls (who am I?)
I get you high and I'm smoked in halls (who am I?)
You must come if hear me call
So who am I?
I'm kinda wild, I do a killing with a smile (who am I?)
I move in file when you hear me go ""Blau!"" (who am I?)
I'm Teflon so how you like me now?
So who am I?
Verse 2: Peter Gunz
Yo, I travel at the speed of light and it ain't right
And I quick to run up and take your life in the night
I hang with cops and thugs and they call me slugs
Just like Christmas I light shit up
I got cousins and clips
That hang around Bloods and Crips
Mostly found around your drugs and whips
Find me in a artery
Somewhere in your body
While your lying there leaking looking at Lord saying ""soddy""
I was shot at the best
(fly) Hit many vests
But 9 out of 10 I pierce through many chests
Colorblind, hell if I'm not like fuck it
Kids and ladies and even babies kick the bucket
S'more like a rich bitch in the store shopping
Seven I pop, there'll be a lotta niggas dropping
Majority, minority die when I fuck
But I mean I'm just a bullet and I don't give a fuck
Chorus 2: Lord Tariq
I'm kinda wild, I do a killing with a smile (who am I?)
I move in file when you hear me go ""Blau!"" (who am I?)
I'm Teflon so how you like me now?
Who am I?
Unseen and I'm quick to do a killing (who am I?)
I move fast and I laugh at penicillin (who am I?)
The type of nigga that'd make ya die
So who am I?
Verse 3: Lord Tariq & Peter Gunz
You can find me in your body if you don't use protection
It's fifty cent all your fucking life learn a lesson
I'm small but deadly, break a nigga down
I know you heard my name cause nigga I get around
Now I pray on the ones who lust for sex and drugs
Shooting out dicks and needles polluting your blood
When I see you, and I see you
Corrupt and I'm up and who you fucking, who she fucking...
Yo I'm the biggest nigga on your block
And I kill more niggas than your Glock
Like or not
I'm outta control
Pull your body outta your soul
Than I laugh as I watch your family watch you fold
Now you can catch me but can't kill me
Try to scare but you can't feel me
Mothafuckers just don't hear me
In the year 2010
Probably be the end
I just spread around the world and I do it again
Chorus 3: Lord Tariq
Unseen and I'm quick to do a killing (who am I?)
I move fast and I laugh at penicillin (who am I?)
The type of nigga that'd make ya die
So who am I?
What, what

Standing by the sneaker-store, and said that she seen me before
But I don't believe it yo, she must have seen the ice-shinin
Beneath the sleeve-roll, she like the way the diamonds go
Never mind (bitch), I'm about to blow, I gotta swerve
And she had the on fast to commin ass, she can go

Keep On,Make It Reign,1998,"Verse 1: Peter Gunz
Uh, come on, come on, come on
Uh, and I see you
This is it
In '97 I made plans to see mo' money
In '98 I blasted out in the phat 420
When I hit the block kids stop look and stare
Girls they point, ""Yo that's that nigga over there""
I get a lotta love, lotta hate
Yes that's the bet you make when you see a lotta cake
Now they calling me fake
Shit back they was calling me love
Now they're scratching up my car and calling me blood
See it be the ones you know scheming on the low
Saying you're dope but steady sizing up your Rol'
I drift, to the past where there's no riches
No hits and no chips and no bitches
Just another cat named Peter
Trying to make a dollar off a nine millimetre
Now life a little sweeter
I'm in the dealer
Coppin' a drop
On the beach in Hawaii with Mariah, wop!
Laying up in Wakiki, MTV, figures why these niggas wanna envy me
Maybe cuz this young lady wanna sin for me
Because I ball you got it in me?
But Ima
Chorus: Peter Gunz & Lord Tariq
(keep on)
Ballin' 'til the day I die
Keep climbing 'til I reach the sky, Ima (keep on)
Getting money cause it's meant for I
I deserve yo I went for mine Ima (keep on)
And even though you hope I fail
I turn around and hope you prevail (keep on)
And to my sisters in the struggle alone
And to my brothers that's locked in jail just (keep on)
Verse 2: Lord Tariq
Yo in the early days of the Lord everything was shey-shey
Everyday was pay day
Selling nickels and dimes
Getting mine in mind state from 86 to 88
I still hear the razor scrape on the plate
A high school drop out
Caught a case mom expects me to cop out
6-G lawyer fee the case dropped like a knockout
The Bronx was the shit but we all hung in Harlem
Where gettin money's easy spending it was the problem
And I cop 16 valves foot is on the pedal
Telling bitches this your last chance to get out the ghetto
For less I wouldn't settle
Think big you get big
Came across the wrong niggas almost split my wig
Some say I bitched up because I switched up and started rapping
But I'm turning gold crack sales to drugs raps platinum
See these streets through my eyes and you can feel 'em though my words
I swore to god that I'm gon' be heard And Ima

To my sisters raising kids alone
Feeling stuck cuz your man ain't home
Don't wanna be a father don't bother
Honey, stay on the job
Cuz that man gotta answer to God so baby (keep on)
I drop a tear on this poem as I write to my dog
Pistol, I miss you sincerely yours from the Lord
You held it down on our side of the town at any cost
And you loved in the checks by Money Boss so (keep on)
To my cousin G
I know you're feeling trapped in the chair
All alone like nobody ain't there
Never fear
Me and Touch still here
Remember what I said dog, Ima be your arms and legs you just (keep on)

Wanna do out the States
Keep your eyes open always look straight
Never fall for the bait

Streets 2 Da Stage,Make It Reign,1998.0,"It's been a long time comin', but I came
Could'a drove a nigga crazy, but I'm sane
It's been a lotta fun, lotta pain
Lotta shit changed, I used to hop trains
Now I'm hoppin' in planes headed for Lanes
I used to have a job, but I quit
Niggas in the Bronx called me Lex
Now they call me mothafuckin' six
Bitches used to front now they switch
'Cause they walk by, tappin' my dick, lickin' they lips
See me in the Bronx strollin'
Down the muthafuckin' street, holdin'
Nuthin' but mothafuckin' heat
Surrounded by thirty niggas with thirty dirty guns
Some, (S-S-S-O-O-O), niggas that'll rip you from yo neck to yo lung
Have you lyin' in a pool of your blood swallowin' tongue
As sweet as it look, don't get it twisted
Or get twisted, too, right up in your mothafuckin' biscuit
I remember when my P-O, said: ""Peto
You need to get yo shit together, and see the C-O""
That's when I, dazed ya crew, with Deja Vu
And rounded up a hundred thugs that'll blaze y'all too

Now from the streets, to da stage

Ayo my transporter 65
Ya, all know the deal
J. Barfield, drive a '82 oldsmobile
Keep a low appeal, but oh yo he's so for real
I stick to old-timers (why?), 'cause a hoe will squeal
They be the first to snitch, so you alert a chick
If she shit on Cam, I'ma hurt the bitch
And I don't care who she mess with
Rest with, put too much time and effort
To get a deficit, fuck the rhetoric
Protection's what y'all better get, stay on defense
'Cause when you see me tense
It's about to be a real wild sequence
Got a deep bench and we hot
Like a weed spot, let off three shots
Spray tee tops, 'bout to take the customers that we got
So we switch now, Don's house come with three Rotts'
And um, Harlem niggas know how to play!

Since '86 I was ownin' shit, I'm born to flip
A O to an 8th, 8th, to keys and quick

Tearin' up the turnpike when I burn right
And a man's position is based on when he earns right?
Well from silly to willy nigg-az wit big gats, that Gotti connect
I walk the world, gettin' Gotti respect
I got a lot to inject to all those who oppose the BX
And to my hoes: How you want those, cash or check? (hahaa!)
Wire or charge, my dick is hard bitch thanx
I ain't got no money 'cause I ain't yo fuckin' bank!

But I'm in the Bronx takin' paper that's tooken
Headed Southbound out of town with a pound of the brown
Fuck the fun, I'm gettin' mon', it's no time to fuck around
I got a stash full of guns and we pumpin' the sounds
Pack the coke in vaseline, foolin' the drug hounds
A big nigga I'm, soon to be now
The block is hot but I'm ice so I'm coolin' it down
I gained weight stepped it up and stepped off the pitcher's mound
I got the money the power, and the bitches now
Feds takin' pictures now
The thugs wanna get ya now
But I got somethin' for you thugs, take this nigga, blaow!

Marmalade,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Can I fuckin' play?
I got a quarter mill' in the bank
No one to thank but me
Break me - ""Gunz""
Bronx ball playa
Take the gatas and suits, from niggas rich
See me - I'm stackin mah chips, flippin' mah chips
Bitch, I...
Peter Gunz, I...
Listen I, gobble, pour all I broke
No joke, clear the smoke, or get smoked
Nigga what?
You stand ya plan
You faka's join, but what's the point you makin'?
Nothin' taken
I seen nigga's come and go
But I'ma say a
A mothafuckin' Bronx playa
I went from eatin' outta trash
To walkin' and pushin' the E-Class
From chickens, to fuckin' bitches that's lookin' like Stacy Cash
An'-now flash
Moms prayed to God that she'd be green
But it was hard for me to raise somebody, I never seen
Cherish
I testify when they ask me ta speak
I said that only Lord knows two rants to praise the Lord
(Nah)

I think it's bout time we'd shine (shine)
Nigga's made chips off mine (mine)
Climb the same rhyme, recline
It's time to bring pain to these nigga's (haaahh)
Drain these nigga's, if they wanna (who wanna?)
I gotta crew from Soundview wantin' war (c'mon)
Start a revolution with mah niggas from the fall (from the faaall)
We gotta bring it all Uptown in the party (uhhh)
Cause Lord Tariq won't you come and get shit started?



Check it yo, I'm in the big black Bronco
Sippin' Rimmey out the bottle
From the Bronx like Billy Blanco
Fortin' high-on on the throttle
My shit dates back like American Bandstands
So ya'll niggas sit and relax while these grands change hands
Stand tall, stick yo chest out boy
And be a man
You bust one, you let them all-out, and go all-out
Wit' dat bug you had to fall-out wit, head-chest
Don't let-'em fall-out, shit
And if I fall-out, quick
It's Money Boss
I'm at the midnight blue
Three times to excite you
Have you drippin' off mah chest, wantin' ta be crew
Wantin' to be flauntin' the shit that we do
But ya can't nigga, ya still young, it's still alot of shit to go through
I been through enough drugs to get you high, think ""I'm Bout It""
Think I'm lyin'? 'Cause I'm rhymin? Nigga mah path would be routed
Shit is real, don't you battle, now get ya bricks fa' tin
Now that's the Steel House of ""Bout It"" (House of ""Bout It"")
Money Boss...

I think it's 'bout time you'd shine (shine)
Nigga's made chips off mine (mine)
Climb the same rhyme, recline
It's time to bring pain to these nigga's
Drain these nigga's, if they wanna (yo who wanna?)
I gotta crew from Soundview wantin' war
Start a revolution with mah niggas from the fall
Gotta bring it all Uptown and hit the party (party)
Peter Gunz won't you come and get this shit started?



'Ey-yo
When you gettin' chips, you got mad tricks ridin' ya pony
But when ya slip, the same stank bitch is wanna journey
Ya baby motha', probably fuckin' brotha' if he trickin'
You resort to ass-kickin', she dick-lickin'
Now you in the mountains up north
Gimme the Nine, time ta think about the dumb shit ya did, play a mind
Sekikes, to all the chickens you treated, like they was queens
Ain't never rolled a nigga recenin' up in his greens
Conversatin his low, ho'
Ain't you gettin' chips?
You get a check on the first birth, help a nigga live
I used to get.. rent money, I sent and spent money
I never lent money, I burned and bent money
So why you actin' funny, wit' yours?
Put them drawers on yo ass, and I knew the stash, a baby of course
When ya baby bounce up into the slack
I took your son like he was my son, he never lack
And baby wise up

Nigga it's 'bout time you'd shine (shine)
But nigga's made chips off mine (mine)
Climb the same rhyme, recline
It's time to bring pain to these nigga's
Drain these nigga's, if they wanna (yo who wanna?)
I gotta crew from Soundview wantin' war
Start a revolution with mah niggas from the fall (haahah)
We gotta bring it all Uptown and hit the party (party)
Lord Tariq won't you come and get this shit started?
*Chorus*


'Ey-yo
I be the Bronx narrator, recitin' my ghetto stories
To mah playas, from the smallest to the tallest category
While you got shadow warriors, money ain't mah problem
You want aches and breaks, of that shit? Well I got 'em
Money Boss, get crossed off, so ring the alarm
Bronx roots, I recruit the thoughts, I'm making bombs
I'm the calm and the stong, Hiroshima the bomb
I have you in protection programs, somewhere on the farm
Wit' mah eyes on you niggas, like the feds and faka's
Got they eye's on the sippa's, big tippa's, and dice shaka's
Small head-build, means you the small-time nigga
With small thoughts, and small means, of gettin' small figures
By all means, expedite, ""Live long - prosper""
Ya live-wrong suits, got'cha
Remember that mink you bought? For 9 G's and somehow split the scene
It's in the government auction, for 900 - what does it mean?

I think it's 'bout time we'd shine (shine)
But nigga's made chips off mine (mine)
And climb the same rhyme, recline
It's time to bring pain to these nigga's
Gotta, drain these nigga's, if they wanna ('ey-yo who wanna?)
I gotta crew from Soundview wantin' war
Start a revolution with mah niggas from the fall
We gotta bring it all Uptown and hit the party (uh)
Peter Gunz & Lord Tariq ta get this shit started? (get it started)
