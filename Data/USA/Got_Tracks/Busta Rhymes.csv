Calm Down,Calm Down: The Clash EP,2014.0,"Turn my mic up
Turn my mic up

(Ready on the right) Ayo, calm down, nigga
(Ready on the left) Ayo, calm down, nigga
(Ready on the right) Ayo, calm down, nigga
(Ready on the left) Fuck it, blackout, niggas!

Oh, my Lord! Lower the casket down (Down!)
Sprinkle the ash, or get your ass kicked, pow! (Pow!)
Frown while I shit on your crown, skip town (Town!)
Ground zero, Shapiro the king cash cow (Cow!)
Do I make 'em say ""Wow!""? Strip! (Ow!)
Bow! I sit with the pound, Click, (Blow!) Blow!
Click, click, (Blow!) Click, (Blow!)
Stop traffic, dropping them classics, flip now
Bitches, I’m making them skip with thou
Art, you don’t really want start, when I growl
(Rawr, rawr, rawr!)
Let me come and mop up the knockoffs​
When I pop off and never stop, 'cause
When we do come through, you better lock doors (Pause!)
The wolves wanna eat, peep how they lock jaws
No need to cook up the coke, you see we cop raw
And if you ain’t had enough—
What—in the fat fishes of a phenomenal
Fahrvergnügen fuck—is going on?
Back with the B.A Baracus, callous bang, on another song
I’mma have these niggas nervous
And clipping they nails and dribbling
And witness them, nibble them, like sunflower seed shells
See these scales, got my weight up heavy, like three whales
And I shit on these males, till it's stinkin'
Fouler, than a weed smell,nigga, your tree fell
See how they Twitter, Facebook and Instagramming an email?
Talking I'm sick, I got them shook and I bang 'em at retail
Until they cripple, see I cook, like I’m slanging a weed sale
Until I triple bred, and whoop ‘em and drag 'em like females (*Gasp!*)Oh, see well, these niggas already know
The way that I fuck shit up, minus the details, the case is shut
Your bitch remind me of replacement butt
Kind of an ancient slut, it's going down
Like she was a basement fuck
Swell up this shit, like I’m sticking steaks in they gut
So gracefully and graciously, I painfully wake niggas up
Ragdolling these niggas, and attacking
Like apes in the cut, I’m waiting for the taking
While I break niggas neck, like a bracelet (Fuck!)
It’s kinda like, me having a case in the truck
And drinking ‘til I’m blasted
Harassing and erase a nigga (What!?)
Keeping 'em open and blacking until I’m leaving ‘em stuck
And got ‘em happier, than a child in a park chasing a duck
While I’m chasing a buck
These funny niggas be chasing they luck
I be lacing them up, like boots
When I’m pushing they face in the mud— (Ahh!)
Missiles I fling, while I spit live wire
‘Til this shit circling back around
With more fire for me to melt a brick surfacing back a sound
While I light up shit that'll cause a quick worship
Andgather around, it's certain this shit'll splatter cliques
Painful and make ‘em scatter (Blink!)
Shameful, the way I shatter (Split!)
Shit apart, it doesn't matter (Rip!)
Your head up off your shoulders (With)
Bullets bigger, than a boulder
And they break ‘em and they know it's (Classic!)
And the way it’s going, you could easily get your (ass-kicked)
See, me and Shady together; we’re crazy
Like baking a vomit and rabies cake, like a pastry bitch
(We that sick!)like I come from Haiti
I’m suggesting you pay me, don’t make me wanna spaz
(Al-la-la!) Like I’m a crazy Israeli (Bastards!)
While I bite the beat up, and I'm starting to heat up (Yack!)
I’m chopping your foot off
Now it’s mine, and I’m putting my feet up (Black!)
Back to the hood and off to the wild
And I’m hoping you protect your child
And I been blacking out so long
Niggas is asking if the hook had died, nah
But the beat is fried!

Yo
(Ready on the right) Ayo, calm down, nigga
(Ready on the left) Ayo, calm down, nigga
(Ready on-)
(""Yo, chill, man—chill!"")
(Ready on the right) Ayo, calm down, nigga
(Ready on the left) Ayo, calm down, nigga
(Ready on the right) Ayo, calm down, nigga
(Ready on the left) Fuck it, blackout, niggas!

Apparently, there's a light contagiousness to this tirade
It just might make you sick, so irate
With this my brain is just like a fucking fried egg
Is my mind scrambled? 'Cause I'm lit—narrow minded
But go through such a wide range of this emotion
That my rage has gotta squeeze through it sideways
I just pulled up, in Clive Davis's driveway
With his personal memoir, saying ""He's bi!""
Waving a nine, a picket sign, egging his ride
Making him cry, ""Rape!""—then arrive naked
And drive straight through the gay pride parade
""Yay! Yippee-Ki-Yay!"", 'cause here I—
Wait, did the world just pee on my leg?
And should I take it as a sign
Maybe to take 'em back into time? (Shady!)
I stuck out like a sore thumb, so I gave 'em the finger
To take the attention away
From my stinking face it was bringing
Changed the whole complexion of the game
But just in case you was thinking an inkling of replacing
The kingpin of crazy, you're wasting your ink then
So if this is any indication, of what you may be facing
You better make a distinction, 'cause you fake imitations
Are leaving a bad taste, fuck making a bad impression
That's the worst impersonation I've ever seen
Who raps nasally? Eyes hazely?
Rhymes crazily, but sounds like he may
Need some Flonase when he's speaking?
What kind of stupid question is that?
""Hey, Mrs. Abraham Lincoln!
Other than your husband's fucking brains that were leaking
How'd you think that play was this weekend?""
You ain't the real Slim Shady, sit your ass down, faggot (Ew)
See me on a ballot, I'm running for class clown
Rich Democrat bitch, so I'm just the candidate
To come fuck up the whole party
Me and Flipmode starting a campaign
To have every campus, on a fucking rampage
Act my goddamn age? I am—eight!
So let's get smashed and wake up the next day
With the room trashed, covered in Band-Aids
Glass ashtray smashed
Champagne splashed on the lampshades
But this ain't up for debate, this is undebatable
Shady for president ho, don't make me go take it back
To the days of old, with Sway & Tech radio
When I was taking so much NoDoz and LSD
I almost fell asleep on the Wake Up Show
Fuck you telling me, fools?
I was rippin' shop, raisin' hell up in Drew's
When Penelope Cruz was still developing boobs
Me and Bus put it down, like a sick pet
You're fucking with vets, dog, fucking internet bloggers
""I sit in front of my computer all day
And comment on everything, I'm an expert on everything, Everything sucks—play the next song!""
Guess if I hopped out your freaking laptop, you idiot prick
With Biggie and kicked the living shit out you, I'd be dead wrong
Son of God; I'm the S.O.G
Like a wet log, pores never get clogged
'Cause I'm so full of self-esteem, that I sweat fog
Yes, yes, y’all (Wah!)—steady on the left, y’all
Step off, 'fore you get stepped on
Soft? 'Bout as commercial as my fucking Learjet
Jealousy’ll get you green as a Chia Pet
I can see that you’re visibly upset, dog
Alert, alert, girl—alert
Once you enter in my house of pain, you're in a world of hurt
So (""Jump around! Jump! Jump!"")
Get that ass shaking (""Jump around! Jump!"")
Came to hit you, with a fan favorite
But if you too fly for coach better get them arms
And freaking hands flailing and (""Jump!"")
Like Van Halen and pray for a damn tailwind
More afraid of success, than I am of failure
So what does that tell ya?
That on a grand scale, I don’t give a fuck about nothing
Like Stan mailing his last piece of fan mail
Before he ran straight into the damn railing

""Yo, chill, man—chill!""",https://genius.com/Busta-rhymes-calm-down-lyrics

Thank You,The Abstract and the Dragon,2013.0,"Woo! Welcome to the bank
Where you deposit Young Money
And, and you get Cash Money
I'm Tunechi the boss
And live from the vault, is Busta Buss

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yo
Swag mania, pop that goes most, carry the most
Beautiful bitches with us happily toast
Keep the faculty close, gross when we give them a dose
Got them OD-ing, leaning in each Coast
Scenery froze, take notes, rock Rolls, diamonds that fit us
Chanel minks in the winter, who fucking with us?
We coming to give them the shivers, watery flows spilling like rivers
Flooding the street, hoping niggas swimming is moving gorillas
King Kongs, Godzillas when we roll up
Seat filling niggas, get up when we show up

Uhh, shit
Please don't throw up, hold your liquor, grow up
If you robbing niggas, we gon' show you how to blow up
Thank your lucky stars it's the Rap Czar, tuck your shit in
My niggas bite like Rin Tin Tin, my chagrin
You never win, model thin, walking crack in your shin
She gives in every time that I spin
Square up, bow down to the kings of the hall
We wade on, talk shit while we ball so what's cracking with y'all?

Native New Yorker, the slick talker keeps it in order
Call the reporter, stepping like British walkers
Legendary swag flu and see the influence, just see how we do it
Get them into it steadily, God I'm stupid, so undisputed
Act fool, back tool until they pop off
Police crowd up the street, blocking them off, locking them off
Got these niggas wilding while I signal my soldiers
Bossing it up, maintaining composure, stand on the sofa
Thirty bottles, twenty waitresses, bring them over
See how we light up shit, nigga, call the promoter
And tell that nigga bring the bag, better hurry up with it
And count the money up proper, cause you can get it!

I want to thank You, Heavenly Father
Yeah, it feel good, don't it? Uhh
For shining Your light on me
It feel good, don't it? Uhh
I want to thank You, Heavenly Father
Ay, I want to let y'all know
Ay, ay, I want to let y'all know, this Yeezy
For shining Your light on me
And you listening to Q-Tip

Settle up, stiletto up, saddle up and let's go
Good times, only difference, niggas making it though
Chatter is up, peep the way we batter it up
On top of the mountain, folding the ladder up
You dead and done, rip up your paper 'cause your status is none
Transfixed on the strengths of the page, whether chopper or gauge
You're just a single cause you wouldn't engage
Turnt up with the script on the cup, you keep the goblets with us

See how we push sometimes a man fi get kuff?
Beat him in the head, boop-be-de-de-boff, zippity-boof
Beat him in the head again, ""Stop killing me, wolf""
Whop, beat a nigga till he drop, piggity-poof
Oxy in me pulse, he don't want no problem with niggas
Fuck it, let's get to drinking, poison our livers
Dammit we sinners, when me and Abstract together, see we deliver
She got me touching it, fucking on all my fingers
Dammit we winners, pillar of this rap shit, homie they know
Kill everything until it's time for me to go
That's when I bomb it with a blow and then I black and get a little bit dummy
The microphone is bleeding, you should take it from me

Incredibly we do it and it resonates the music, iTune it, YouTube it
It could never ever be refuted
It's gnarly for niggas and naughty for ninas, bitches and ballerinas
Ballers and in-betweeners, blatant nonbelievers and overachievers
Kicking it in Pele Adidas, drink Alizé liters
All of you must reconcile a leader
She's begging to eat us and her man's attitude defeat us
But never a scandal because me and Bus, we're prone to handle
We're gentlemen

Not to mention, we're veterans, second, he need some medicine
Before I black as he get off my premises
Better fly, you pelican, idiot ass niggas but then again
You need a suit for your funeral measurements
See me doing it effortless, it's never getting no better than this
Giving your shit to convince a better preference
Watch me turn them to skeletons, see how I come and bring out the betterness?
Time is with it, I rep the foreverness
Flying United Emirates, sized private plane, that kind of etiquette
Purchasing diamonds, handle them delicate
Now you need you a better ref
You could peep us regulating, see we all in this bitch like we ain't never left

I want to thank You, Heavenly Father
For shining Your light on me
I want to thank You, Heavenly Father
For shining Your light on me
I know it couldn't have happened without You
Ooh-ooh, without You
Ooohh, without You
Ooohh, without You",https://genius.com/Busta-rhymes-thank-you-lyrics

I’ll Hurt You,Unreleased Songs,2006.0,"Yeah! Guess who it is!
Ayo, Dre, I think they in trouble
Whoo!
Scott Storch, why you have to do it like this to 'em?!
Feels like a new day!

Listen, now every time I come
And I hit you niggas with shit regardless
You get retarded and then niggas ain't got a clue
On how the fuck I do what I do and say what I say
And spit what I spit you ain't never even gotta question who
‘Cause you know that I'm the only nigga that can ever come
And spitefully turn the place in to a motherfuckin' zoo
Then I come and I spit c-crazy sh-sh-sh-shit
And m-m-m-make n-n-niggas do exactly what I want 'em to
From my point of view, instead of trying to step up
You still trying to play catch up
And keep up with the way a nigga grew
These niggas panic and freakin' get schizophrenic
And let they emotions out
And I doubt they can ever test my crew
Take a second, check it, I reckon my records are better than
Whatever record you recorded, that's why your shit is through (Whoo!)
You fuckin idiot, I don't think you get it
I'm one of the greatest ever, period, every syllable is true

Now if you ain't blind
And you ain't handicapped in your vision
I think it's simple enough, think that it's really plain to see
No matter how much you try
No matter how much you make an effort
You niggas can never ever really fuck with me
‘Cause I'll hurt you, and I will learn you a thing or two
And I'll hurt you, and I'll finish your career for you, I'll…

Shit on a mic and do do, my doo-doo, you do not have a fightin' chance to move you, you were covered in my poo-poo
Smothered in my manure while I spit saliva fluid do-do-do-do-do-do g-g-g-goobers are glued to you
You don't have a clue as to what we're about to do, do you?
So just sit back and watch somethin'
You just gon' have an a-chew
You just made me sneeze, I'm allergic to beats like these
Please excuse me, my allergies are actin' up; thanks a lot, Scott
You're probably wonderin' why there's thunder
And everyone is runnin' and duckin' up
Under everything up on the block
‘Cause Busta Bus and Flipmode just tip toed into the club
Then with Shady quietly trying not to start up a riot with Doc
But since we all been spotted
We might as well have a party
So gather 'round everybody, come on, let's get our drink on
And you ain't got to do nothin' special for this occasion
Just reach in the closet, put something on, and get to the club

Now if you ain't blind
And you ain't handicapped in your vision
I think it's simple enough, think that it's really plain to see
No matter how much you try
No matter how much you make an effort
You niggas can never ever really fuck with me
‘Cause I'll hurt you, and I will learn you a thing or two
And I'll hurt you, and I'll finish your career for you, I'll…

Catch you niggas and snatch you niggas
You bunch of bumblin' fools
Who got me rumblin' dudes all the way down the block
Keep on stumblin' and jumblin' over their words and vowels
Throw in the towel, see you niggas is on the clock
And you runnin' out of time, see, I'm tired of all y'all
M-m-m-mumblin-m-m-mumblin', n-n-nigga I got it locked
Every single time you put my shit in your CD player
And turn up the volume
You bang your head, because your shit is not
I continue with crumblin' niggas and tumblin' niggas
You struggle while I humble a nigga with the Glock
Then I watch you while I'll keep on fumblin'
While I got you tr-tr-tremblin'
Before one of my niggas bust your head with a rock
Before I start to do another thing
Then to make you crown me the king
With such a butter swing, nigga, follow the flock
Now watch my brother bring all my diamonds to summer bling
While I'm climbing and fuck her
Then tell you bitch to get off my yacht

Now if you ain't blind
And you ain't handicapped in your vision
I think it's simple enough, think that it's really plain to see
No matter how much you try
No matter how much you make an effort
You niggas can never ever really fuck with me

Can You Keep Up?,UnKnown,2011.0,"[Verse 1: Twista, 
Busta Rymes
 and 
Both
]
Now it's finna be some energy, we got the remedy
I'm in the vicinity of a nigga that can spit it with me
Feel the fire whenever we act up
Everybody else is incompatible with the artillery
So forget about it when you hear about it
Cause it's too fast when I pass the baton to Busta
Hit a victim in the middle of the body with a bullet and a rhythm
Every murder is a structure
Every time I hit you niggers with another jam be blacking
I be sounding like a nigga full of anger
Now I'm back to beat you in the head, I'll bring another banger
With my nigga Twist, everything we do be up to wanger
You don't really, really wanna see the way that I come
And I'll give it to you, get up on the ceiling see a nigga numb
Do it how I wanna do it 'till I make another nigga drop
I put my money on it, homie, I'm the one
Go on here, pick it up, carry it the way you wanna carry it
Do whatever you wanna do
Show the competition how we gunning too when we coming through
Better never let a nigga never get in front of you
I wanna be, I wanna pro, wanna get in
Then racin' so fast, they call me flash
Don't nobody really wanna
We can hit 'em like a couple of millimeters
Woopin' a niggas' ass
Skibbedy boop, skibbedy bop, skibbedy beep
I'm skipping all over on another Just Blaze hit
Now I know a lot of y'all been sitting, waiting and wondering
Was we ever gonna do this shit
And then we came to hit 'em with another flow
Pop champagne, celebrate and kill another show
Gotta campaign, the greatest niggas, y'all already know that
Never do this kinda shit, Twista, get 'em, gotta go
Now I gotta ask y'all

Can you keep up?
Can you keep up?
Can you keep up?
Can you keep up?
Can you keep up?
Can you keep up?
Now try to catch me if you can
Can you keep up?
Can you keep up?
Can you keep up?
Can you keep up?
Can you keep up?
Can you keep up?
Now try to catch (Now try to catch me)

Busta Rhymes
 and 
Both
]
Kill everybody cause I'm gunning outta stress
If I'm running outta breath, he gonna pick up where I left off
Keep him with me when he spitting cause the flow be the bidness
I'm a menace when I bust a lyrical tec off
Go faster than Ricky Bobby, kill him in Talladega Nights
Niggas try to get up, when a nigga hit up
When it I come I promise you gotta pay the price
Look, why don't everybody wanna come and try get a little taste
Of the shit I got, let me put it all up in your face
When I spit it I got a nigga wilding all over the place
Everybody better listen here
Cause you know when I bring him I will never, never stop
Make a nigga rewind and bring it back to the top
Throw the shit up in the streets and I be running every block
Everybody better stand clear
Like a millimeter when I be booking the track up
Motivated for murder whenever I act up
A couple of phenomenal niggas can stack up
Gets anybody that wanna live in the back up
Killing everybody when I bust a clip off
Cause I'mma be attacking them with the insane flow
Then I be having them calling me Twista Phelps
And my nigga Buss like 
Usain Bolt
Shocked a nigga like I was a thousand volts
Now I'm sailing on the beat the way I'm sailing on the boat
The way I gotta kill 'em and the way I gotta flow
You don't really wanna test me, boy, cause I'll pop ya
When I'm in the spot you know you can't leave
I spit every word 'till, 
damn I can't breathe
You never heard 'till you nosebleed

Now I gotta ask y'all

You can talk about it with a bunch of people
That say that I'm a lyrical manifestation of rhythm
Then I come and do the shit I gotta do and then I bang ‘em
And get 'em and do it every single time I hit 'em
When I do it its gotta be accurate
Like I'm attacking the rhythm with such a vocal tenacity
See the way a brother blacking I’m back and infant
Cause every time we in the place you feeling the capacity
I be coming with it, he be coming with it
And nobody really do it how we do it
And the flow is so fluid I gotta be an anomaly
Gotta be an Odyssey; the prodigy, and I'mma be the one to prove it
Don’t you ever forget it the way we coming
And they sending somebody, gonna probably be needing a medic
So give us the credit and I thought that we should oughta
Be coming to slaughter so call out the order see the way we do it

Can you keep up?

We been together for a few years, shared a few tears
Called each other nicknames like Sugar Plum and Poo Bear
I'm always on the road, hardly ever home
Always busy this, busy that, can't talk on the phone
I know you aggravated, walk around frustrated
Patience gettin' short, how longer can you tolerate it?
Listen, Ma, I'm just motivated
I do this for us, stuck on the grind, tryin' to elevate it now

Ayo, to really be honest you stuck with me through my whole struggle
Can't even express through words how much the kid loves ya
I'ma stand as a man, never above ya
Well, I could tell that you different from most, slightly approach you
And the ill shit about it? We don't sex every day
But when we sex, we tease in a passionate way
I love the way you touch it, those little elaborate ways
Got the god feelin' released to relax for the day
It's on you, Ma

Shh, Mami listen
I feel your love for me, baby, and how it move through you
I been longin' for the moment to talk the truth to you (Listen)
I'm never home, I always get up and go
Puttin' you through the unnecessary rigmarole
I never meant to put a thousand pounds of stress on your head
I love the way we sleep and how we always cuddle in bed
Baby, I stay embracin' your patience, sheddin' your tears with me
I ask you, my mami, please continue to bear with me

We started out broke, constantly on the roll
Cuttin' up in the streets like we would never get old
Went from loosies and buses, and fifty cent sodas

Mad years passed, still got each other back (

Hello,The Return of the Dragon: The Abstract Went On Vacation,2015.0,"I'm gonna find you and make  you want me
Hello rap game, nǐ hǎo, how you durrn'?
I done took my time, now it's time to take my turn
My curses been in verses since my firstest brain cells burnt
But I done been deferred to assistants and interns
And I done been on hold for some years, it's getting old
I'm too blessed to fit the mold, they said press six to give your soul
Or not and you can hold, you ain't never gonna explode
Or expand across the globe, but look like I just skipped the cold
Hello all up in your ear, you should hear me loud and clear
We was not allowed in here, and now we smoking loud in here
How we in the game and they ain't put a chain on them
Cleaning in that thing and my Sprite don't got a stain on it
Lil Xan fuck the Chance up, Donnie Trumpet said bands up
Donnie McClurkin said stand up
I know contracts are like handcuffs
I know combat when it's hand to hand or with handguns
I know answers, I know man to man, can't stand us
I know exactly how you wanna brand us
I take campers to the campus fix the trips and get the bus
Fast like Twista mixed with Bust
When Windy lost boys I had pixie dust for a pick me up
Spit shine 'til it's crystal clean like Listerine from a Dixie cup
Mama Jann band-aid kiss the cut
Now I'm thinking about offices and mansions with amenities
And runneth over pools and infinities
Award shows and house wives and games shows and Hennessy
It's different from the energy I see being in your vicinity
Mistaken identity, you behaving differently
(Ayo Chance, don't stop now nigga)
You the protest you the marches
You on the forefront you the farthest
You the melanin in the darkness
Wrong number what a shame
You and I look just the same
That's why I got you in my name
Lets push it to the masses give them wavy, give them Surf
One time shout-out to Bust, I know this a long ass verse
But I'm just getting started I'm taking this rap shit global
Put my music in the museum, put my bars in Barnes and Noble
Shape the office like an oval, make the triangle a circle
Teach the little boys and girls, tell them I was your referral
I'm Chicago like a gyro, I'm Chicago like some harolds
I will borrow from the Boroughs , show tomorrow to the world
Place the urban and the rural, make the wall into a Mural
Lead it where it need to be, they jocking like a Nitti beat
Now they cannot get rid of me, bye, bye to the industry
Lionel Richie is it me? hello?

(Chance The Rapper sing it to 'em)
Is it me you're looking for?
Gonna find you
And make you want me

Bust Rhymes it come with the force and lay it across
Hit you like I'm playing lacrosse
And if it was July I'd drop it on the day of the fourth
The fire make you bust a shot
Pull a string and get lost
Stinging guitars (Hello)
I'm here with the floss
A chain with a frost
While the yellow diamonds shine with a gloss, I'm cold (ah)
Shit heavy like we weighing a horse
Violate, one shot will turn your brain into sauce
Just pray I remorse
Nigga you know we whip from the start
You slept on the art
Bugging on how we put out your spark
We separate the heat from corny shit and kept it apart
Step on a dart, spit will test the rest of your heart
No rest in the dark (hello)
We the best of the sharks, we love and we fart
And leave a mark so put it in park
Whenever we bark, we make you come and get with this nigga
Get next to this nigga, we past professional
You can call me a specialist nigga
We fuck shit up while you call me the best at this nigga
The way we put it down you'll be calling a censorship nigga
We holding a higher rank and we holding it back
And I'm grimey niggas home when they shank
Or they clickity clank (hello)
Now just clap from front to back and just react (what?)
Like you know you posted till you die it is the feeling (what?)
Keep on clapping get to acting up now keep on packing (what?)
All inside (is high) now feel the fire in the building
You can never test they way I do it
And the way I be moving my mouth and be
Shaking and shining and breaking em out
And making the noise I be making everytime
I be hitting a song I keep you waiting
(Real talk) real shit
And we'll see where y'all coulda come from
I'll hit you with another mega after the fact
And they want me to go a little quicker
Get a bit of this then (bududududu) what's faster than that?
(Hello) And I ain't going no where
It's me, Busta Bust
Smooth Chance The Rapper
Text move big up

Just know
God got his hand on us
I feel so good about me
Trust this
We good over here
I pray that you're good over there
(Hello) we don't lose
But by losing us
That might be a significant loss for you",https://genius.com/Busta-rhymes-hello-lyrics

Uncut Cypher,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Aye yo, weak minded bitches fall victim because my charm's strong
Jazzy pair of Louis on my feet, Shoey Armstrong
Ma couldn't be my cheerleader with platinum pom-poms
She the type to misrepresent a king like Lebron's mom
Beating on my chest with a crown, King Kong Don
Langston Hughes, I write a poem that do the Bible Psalms harm
These other rappers want problems, then bring it on umm
This rapping beef is nothing, my studio's an Islam farm
And all cowards'll become victims of man
Keep a 5th of Remy and a stick of piff in my hand
Yeah they fly but I'm a pilot that no one can understand
Plus the way I go ham'll make a Muslim say 'Damn.'
Hustle hard, trips to Miami for three days
So I can meet with the connects and get the D. Wade
Run up in the Gucci store and drop 3k
You bum, I could get your whole outfit out of BJ's
Lyrical scientist, leaving mics with psoriasis
All this work that I'm shitting is Michael Myer's psychiatrist
Pyrics suppliacist, who be lying stiff when the iron spits
I come alone, just me and one 9 Johnny 
And let my bitch serenade through these slums
And blow so much loud, I need a hearing aid
For my lungs
And as far as metaphors, rate this
I was a snail til haters threw salt on me and I dissolved into greatness

What goes around comes around like a hula hoop
Hair weave killa, I'll show up to your funeral
All this work, I need a cubicle
Clear coat cuticle, different color diamonds like a Rubix Cube
If this was New Edition, I'll be Bobby Brown
Put the check over your head and call it Nike Town
How could I be down, Free Boosie, wipe me down
My credit card is black and proud
I've been trapping since Rocsi had the ankles out
I'm going to the money and I took the paper route
Uh Yeh, I'm hood approved and I'm street tested
You a nobody............ anorexic
If you stay next to me, you're close to a blessing
So, I'm guessin, I could get arrested -
For aggravated flexing, with all this ice on
My mic on, I apply pressure like a python
And everybody know this that body flow, bench press, cardio
They try to cramp a nigga style like a Charlie horse
Yeh, they plot on you, and they drop on you
I put a Glock to your eye and call it glaucoma
Bow! From 30 nights of sipping dirty sprite
I call this shit Bluetooth because I don't need a mic, 2 Chainz...

I said ""Please Stephen Hill, don't even put me in a cypher.'
There's only one outcome when I get a little hyper
You gonna start seeing niggas getting nervous with they shook ass
Yop! Yop! Yop! Cause I'm merciless with the whoop ass
Don't get shook now, what you sliding for
Soon as you slide, you getting stuck like a nigga was sliding doors, Bing!
A fucking park in my coupe
Bitch I can come and run circles around you dudes like I'm stirring the soup
Better move from out my way before you niggas get pushed down
When these wack niggas spit you be hearing a 'shoosh' sound
Not 'shoosh', when you wanna hear young niggas on their come-up
But shoosh lil homie, SHHHHH-Shut the fuck up!
I see through niggas more then a little, your translucent
You know I come for blood like nigga need a transfusion, bing!
Listen good, I hope you hear me on these features
Murk your face with dark and brown spots like brick oven pizzas
You niggas make me wanna wrap my fingers round triggers
I skin cliques and make leather jackets out of rap niggas
Damn it! I crashed, planets like asteroids
The witnesses be watching you be doing them foul boy
I shrink niggas down to size, smaller then altoids
And remain the reason the people be makin wild noise
I bodybag you until I'm done with this shit
And tell the truth, I'm at the point, I'm having fun with this shit
Making families really looking, and somebody's really checking
We left him laying stiff in the frozen meat section
Im on my pinky ring floss
Bitches be callin me cat-daddy, when they want to speak to the boss
Whips matching the rubix cube color
So many rings on both of my fingers, now they calling me Ring-A-Ling brothers
Spit venom to the people's enjoyment
Squeeze niggas til their head pop, have these niggas leaking like ointment, bing!
What the fire be sparking
Have you laying next to your man like both them niggas parrellel parking
Wanna act tough, hope you niggas know what you starting
WOOF! You got a dog, or is it a barrel we barking
They got a god, pull a threat with these bars
Got chicks from here to Morroco, skin color Hennesy bronze
If you dudes really thinking your low key
Closest you really would get to shining is when your shining my trophies
Fortunate for you dudes, I'm knowing your whole steez
Niggas front and do nothing, babble and blow weed
When I see dollar
Green money tint, Mark Jacobs leather suit
Strutting motherfucker, my money sick
Rènado Slim money, we famous now
Money freaking so long, dude got a crib on Uranus now
You really need to fuck with me to fall back
Or I'll skin you niggas, lay you out just like a leapord skin format now
If you ain't knowing how I'm handling niggas now
I ain't fighting no more, I stuff animal niggas now, gone

Yeah, slow it down real quick I want them to understand every word
(Beat slows down)
Slow it down if you moving too fast
Any rapper talk slick I'll Tami Roman his ass
Smackdown vs RAW, lets battle to the death
Or whoever wants to see more bars then DMX
Parents mad cause I cuss at times
Or is it cause I keep a spliff like Busta Rhymes
If you mention MCs, Luda's in the best of em
I'm a stay hard til I die like Hugh Hefner
Magnum sponsored, I'm longer then a marathon
Call me Mega like the head of the decepticons
In my prime like Optimus, rock to this
Chain Hungover like Zach Galifianakis
They say Luda's in the movies, why he rapping still
Cause I need more jaguars then Jacksonville
More bills than Buffalo from my flow
And more blue jays then Toronto
Ludacris I made soccer moms rap
Albums, I drop 8 like Octomom's snatch
Hardly clubbing when I do I be flexing
I be in the cut, that's a Luda C-Section
Yall get your strings pulled, im the orchestrator
Cause I got it made like Arnold Schwarzenegger
Get it, I'll terminate a super-duper man
Kill yourself if you ain't no damn Luda fan",https://genius.com/Busta-rhymes-uncut-cypher-lyrics
We Made It,UnKnown,2008.0,"Together we made it
We made it even though we had our backs up against the wall

See, a nigga survived the worst, but my life is glorious
Better know that I leaped every hurdle and I'm so victorious
Take a look, I'm a symbol of greatness
Now call a nigga Morpheus
As force securin' the win, better believe I'm so notorious
You know that I've been 'bout my bread
Even though we rappin' now (Yes)
And yes, we used to live on the strip
Even though a nigga higher level trappin' now (Uh!)
Superseded every one of my little struggles and (Huh!)
Failure has never ever been an option (trust)
A nigga paper long like rush hour traffic
And I'm about to take the hood shoppin'; get it!

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yo
When it all got started we were steadily just gettin' rejected
It seemed like nothin' we could do would ever get us respected
At best we were stressed
At the worst they probably said we're pathetic
Had all the pieces to that puzzle, just the way to connect it
I was fightin' through every rhyme, tightenin' up every line
Never restin' the question if I was out of my mind
It finally came time to do it or let it die
So we put the chips on the table and told 'em to let it ride
Sing it, yeah!

Shit that I can leave for my children's

Now on my wake-up I smile to see how far I've come
Fightin' for sales on a strip to I gained the hustle from
From nights in jail on a bench usin' my muscles, son
To countin' money like Dre and Jimmy and Russell was
But now I live when I dream, you see we finally did it
Let's make a toast to the hustle regardless how you get it

The way we honor it, you'll never conquer it
See how we wreck has a global effect on even Polish people
Young and restless down to the old and feeble
Peep them, Czechoslovakian to Yugoslavian niggas
Be all into my bounce so don't be botherin', niggas
So NOW you should feel the whole cathedralish bounce
Put one in your stomach leave you in a fetalish crouch, nigga
My vernacular is spectacular
Strategic plans'll have you lookin wacker than a postal office massacre
Is that so? Make moves just like a fatso
Bounce in a minivan Astro after my gat (Blow!)

Ayo, get up, get out, get dough
(Ha, get dough, nigga)
Roll up, light up, and smoke that 'dro
(Smoke 'dro now)
Bitch, shake yo' hips and bounce real slow
Niggas, rep yo' hood, I'm with that
All my niggas
(All my niggas)
If you with me
(If you with me)
Yeah, I see you
(Yeah)
Holla
(Throw yo' guns in the motherfuckin air, c'mon!)
All my bitches, if you're with me
(Yeah, all my bitches where you at now)
Yeah, I see you
(You know I see y'all)
Holla
(Yeah)

My whole entire mind state deeper—
Than astronomy and mathematics like Galileo
Smash you niggas like mashed potato
Back when niggas used to rock Ballys and Clarks
I used to watch, little niggas shouldn't hustle nickel crack in the park
Barrels spray the brighter flame in the dark
Blood-spill stain on the street, that's how niggas be leavin' they mark
Fuckin' with diplomats who love Bailey's
Monopolize and quickly get other money fuckin' with Israelis
So solid how we be symbolic
To a handful of niggas that be all schemin' on the same wallet
Them type niggas that be conspirin' and kidnappin'
Shit happens! Gun clap for you in the gift wrappin'
You should follow how the style switch up
Like a group of religious niggas schemin' to kill they archbishop
You big, pussy nigga, actin' all hard
Call me atheist, because I don't believe in you, God
It's like a grand feast, celebratin' the bounce of the century
I tote the recipe quick for any type of discrepancy
Busta Rhymes, the great renaissance artist and architect
Like how a 
Filippo Brunelleschi
 portrait is so hard to get
We got the obscure shit for the street
Nevertheless, we split your head and your chest, now rock to the beat
Yo, we got the obscure shit for the street
Nevertheless, we split your head and your chest, now rock to the beat

Ayo, get up, get out, get dough
(Ha)
Roll up, light up, and smoke that 'dro
(Get dough, smoke 'dro, muh'fuckers!)
Bitch, shake yo' hips and bounce real slow
(Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!)
Niggas, rep yo' hood, I'm with that

Holla
(Holla at me, now, c'mon!)

Yeah
Busta Rhymes, cookin' up a little brown stew 'n' chicken
Dr. Dre, niggas
Yeah

Yeah, I understand that you're not happy, but that's your wife, and I'm your mistress, so you gotta go back home. But before you do, let me swallow you. Let me lick you in all the right places. I want you to cum all over me, and when you do, I'll bathe you. And then we'll get out the tub, and we'll fuck, and I'll lick your ass, and I'll braid your hair, and you can fuck me anyway you please. We can do almost anything, but once we're finished, and you're happy here, you have to go back home to your wife.

Flipmode Squad Meets Def Squad,The Coming,1996.0,"Taking you to the other terrain, we mash strictly for the cream
Here to kill your whole scene and your motherfuckin team
Little 'Mal, the raw dawg, I know you heard of me
You probably know some bitch niggas who wanna murder me
Busta Reggie Murray Ramp and Mercy's all we need for disaster
For me the microphone master
Look, I crash ya, bash ya skull
Fuck with Mally G if you're trying to take a fall
Niggas talk about killin and never get to it
Fuck the yappin, be true to it, do it
Steady scream about your East and your West side
But you ain't in it when it comes to the homicide
Niggas better get up off that bullshit quick
Caught up in the limelight gettin way too slick
See em at the shows bout to rock they shit off
Gettin they peeps fucked up cause they block is soft
As for terror, I sever the best of MC's
Look, little Mally G trippin off these indo trees
About to murder label's jerkin but mercy us
Def Squad niggas prophesize like the Perseus
Droppin degrees to zero with flatlines
Kill your whole entourage off with just one rhyme
One rhyme... one rhyme... just one rhyme
I don't give a fuck I kill em with just one rhyme
Woo, hah, heh, yahah, you wish that you could get with this
Terrorist, lyricist, for your era it's
My time to shine and I'm still payin dues
And I'mma be famous on either rap or the news, motherfucker
I only tell you nothin but the real it's
Tight up in the struggle tryin to get this fuckin meal, why?
Niggas act shifty so I shift along
Three tried, three gone, it's the same ol' song
I seen the shades and the suedes from afar, Pa
But hold up do you know who I are?
The M-A-Double, you want trouble you got it the spot is on
You blot it I got it then shot it it's hot up in your dome
Peace with the chrome piece that I pack
Remember fuck around and catch a Mack to your back

Who the fuck I be I, you cannot see I
Flabbergasted, 
blasting my Magnum P.I
Oops I lie, I got a cannon bout the size of Grand Canyon
I'm prime time, giving MC's Knots Landing
Duck, 
heavens to fuckin Mergatroid
I drop noise that employs the unbelievable
Recline like receding hairline, crime speaks fine
With a nine pull line blind keep mines up my sleeve until
You start to quiver, metabolism splits rivers
I rock so many broads I leave your entourage tender
Like bartenders mix liquor
I serve you over the rocks, I feed you to my flock, now time to click triggers
Manslaughter in alphabetical order for four quarters
Raw water turn sons to granddaughters
Ah ha ha ha ha! I bring trouble where, you sleep
So I double dare to bust you in your bubble bear, coat
Antidotes cause gunsmoke in Tokyo
MC's dosey doe your mics up in this rodeo
My star roast em up by the thousands, millions, quadrillions
Shuttin down national state buildings with high ceilings
Funk Doc to the spot freeze
Creepin on MC's like Vietnamese in army fatigues
Def Squad representer
Hit yo' ass up from the bottom when you enter

Hey yo once a crack head, always a tack head
You have no craftibility all that shit you talk is dead
As sex drugs and violence, balance the scales of reality
Y'all don't want no parts of Keith Murray
I'm nicety and sheisty, I get that ass iced deliciously
Niggas ain't shit to me (word up)
You stupid niggas always got somethin smart to say
And probably can't even spell TWA
My crew is like police pull up and park anywhere (ERRRRR)
Jump out and get it on right then and there (whassup whassup??)
Niggas is pussy and ways and actions show it
Plus y'all niggas dead, and don't even know it
And Def Squad L.O.D. for life (word up, yeah fuck your life)
Act trife I'll let my dog cold fuck your wife

Aiyyo, you just heard the sounds of Mally G
Redman, Keith Murray, bringin the ruckus, the Def Squad
Next up is the Flipmode Squad, this is Howard Cossell
First up to the ring Rampage the Last Boy Scout
Lord Have Mercy For, and the In-fer-mous
Busta Rhymes

Two one two, I'm living life as a rugged MC
When I step up in your jam yo I'm V.I.P
Niggas and bitches be eyein me
I'm spontaneous,
 I'm wreckin brothers out the frame
Because I'm dangerous
I'm well known like Keith Murray and my boy Reggie Noble
Chickenheads get gassed, so they call me on my mobile *beeping*
I'm great distance like AT&T
I stroke like a butterfly, sting like a bee
Yo I Fades Them All like my man Mally G
Whip a nigga ass for free
And makin sure he see visions of me
Rampage the talk of the town
The stalker of New York that fucks up the underground (no doubt)
I'm comin thorough like a pack of Life Savers
Ask Marley Marl who's the real Future Flavors
My technique I freak seven days a week
I'm undefeated, you can see my Quantum Leap
I'm hittin brothers where it hurt, lyrical expert
Those who got no publishing they need to get jerked (no doubt)
A hundred percent, I gets down what I invent
Rap artists be dying to a certain extent
Sometimes they use the underground to make a comeback
That shit is wack, fade away and never come back

For now and forever, it's the, evil that men do
Mental, my inner center Winter
Frosted froze crews inventor, inventor
Invader, evacuate I collapse your major
Straights and loose minds
You're splits two times, for intruders, for these losers
My maneuvers, drop like lugers
Illegal, maybe Lethal, like Gibson's
Splittin blessings, with three Weapons
Lay in the cut like C-Sections, infestin the nine-six
For you mindless, niggas I smack spineless
Or lay back like recliners, as inject jewels
As flesh, moves, when in vaginas, oooh, oooh ooh ooh
Corrupt your minors, like New York City's finest
Lineups, on LSD fine dust, in your sinus
Crush like chinas, opiuMC grinders
My dust, these rhymers
 I hijack like airliners
The infiltrator, creator, I'm sinful
Papers stay viscous like religious cults
Leaders that drop scriptures, and rock clips or assault heaters
My Flipmode niggas, we're like Afghanistan guerillas

If you want more information look listen and read
While I sit back and I roll another fat bag of weed
We about to take control of your set like cruise control speed
Satisfy my lyrical semen, plants my Johnny Apple-seed
Mental slave grip on your brain like white people
My music will dominate the population like black people
Utilize my efforts to execersize my inner thoughts
I capitalize on my many and various styles of all sorts
Hold down the forts smokin drinkin mad quarts
For sports talk to chickenheads in botty lik shorts
Let's get the cream so that we can move up in this fortress
Bounce to art galleries and purchase exotic portraits
Here we go again, another phenomenon when I get on
Busta Rhymes and my nigga named Stretch Armstrong
We represent the ultimate unit for the nine-season
Flipmode Squad will bust your shit for even the wrong reasons
Chaotic sample make a nigga wanna get down
Till they come through like the ATF and shut your shit down
Alcohol tobacco and firearms is how we movin
Raw rapid fire flows while the music keeps you niggas groovin
I don't know who the fuck you really think you foolin
You're so far from up to par and your shit needs improvin
From your conversation the way you come across your shit is off
Malfunctionin my nigga you about to feel the real force
Lay you on your face while I beat you up your head with the holy cross
Exotic niggas blastin off to the Land of the Lost
If you can't see this
I recommend some school for the blind by Helen Keller
Big ups to Lord Have Mercy, Rampage and the Cella Dwellas
Redman and the Rockafellas
Big ups to Mally G, Keith Murray sunny days and bad weathers
But still we travel the world like National Lampoon
It's Busta Rhymes for the whole entire ninety-six SO STAY TUNED!!!

Yo, y'all (y'all) one more time I come

Hot stepping over shit like Ini Kamoze's
Sick lyrics like multiple sclerosis
Focus, while I display flows ferocious
Weak niggas just fall and keep tumbling
Distribute lyrics like I'm hand to hand herb hustling
Hardcore like Quick Draw McGraw

Now I'm on the scene, stepping through like Mean Joe Green
Now I'm making you feel the extreme
Till I black you out then turn on my real high beam

Once you inhale smoke from my flow, carbon monoxide!
Use your imagination, let me take you higher
Rain hail snow earthquakes, 
Earth Wind & Fire
Yo, hit the dirt, get on the floor
I'm that outlaw nigga living right next door
You should just roll out the red carpet
All movin' targets, I got you open like supermarkets
Yo yo—there's only five years left
While niggas is scared to death they breathe they last breath
Days of my life goes on, word is bond
I make you feel my proton, neutron, and electron
Yo, I be the number one icon
Word to the holy Qu'ran, I rock on and on
On and on, hey, on and on and on
You won't understand when I form Voltron

Poetic Justice,Catastrophic,2012.0,"Look, tell me what you really wanna see
I had the greatest experience shooting that video, 'What’s it Gonna Be?'
I had to say it wowing, my heartbeat started pounding
Walked on the set while she got dressed
In cock rings on her outfit
Janet, why you doing this to me?
At the time I couldn’t believe we both were starring in this movie
You're in my video, you know a nigga loved it
I spent 2.4 million on the fucking budget
All my jewelry flooded, see how the kid was on?
First rap nigga album you’ve ever featured on
And I was weak in the Lord, despite the things we said
My first words to Hype Williams is “I can’t believe this dream”
Shot a solo scene, I tried to make mines better
But I love when we shot together, and we rubbed up on each other
But I’m a little jealous, Tip, your tongue went in her mouth
In that Poetic Justice movie, from what I can account
You know what we be ‘bout…
Any time, huh?
Any place, baby?
Now, you know, at the time, I was really
I really had my crush on shorty, man, you know what I mean?
Yeah, I was in love with shorty since she was
Penny and all that on Good Times and shit, you know what I mean?
Ayo, Kamaal, you’s a fucked up dude for doing that to me, man
You broke my heart with that, man

Come on, Buss, you know how many dudes say that to me? Like…
(You know you foul)
Once a day, girl, truly
We grew up with her through the lens of a camera
Didn’t have much, but dare said I’m having her
Shorty was the joint, here’s my case and point
Me and ‘Pac rollin’ L’s in the trailer
Both of us get to scheming how to nail her
First movie about to come out in the theater
Pleasure principle, butt to the makeup truck, so ill I gave her my code
We kissed, I took her control, we swapped as all the film rolled
A marathon, we kept this good thing going, sunset, the moon, it came on
In my mind it would prolong
Listen, the scene was deaded, but I wanted my own edit
Me and Justice kissing keep it going, two pros with credit
A memorable summer in ’92 out in Cali
When I got back up top my niggas asked about the fatty
And did I smash her madly, to that I had to answer
Negative, but I’d give anything to be her dancer
A captivating lady, I used to be her baby
Good Times, they never fading
Look back and celebrate Poetic Justice

At any time, and any place, I don’t care who’s around
At any time, and any place, I don’t care who’s around
In the thunder and rain, you stare into my eyes
I can feel your hand moving up my thighs
In the thunder and rain, you stare into my eyes
I can feel your hand moving up my thighs",https://genius.com/Busta-rhymes-poetic-justice-lyrics

If you ain't from the ghetto, don't come to the fucking ghetto

Hanging out on corners, singing with the fellas
Looking for the cute chicks, trying to find me big fun
Looking for some trouble, or anyone who'll give me some

Didn't know what my life would be (In the ghetto)
I was dumb and oh so lazy (In the ghetto)
Something had a spell on me (In the ghetto)
You all know what I'm talking about (Talking about ghetto life)

You all know what I'm singing about (Talking about ghetto life)

(In the ghetto) Sure we be taking them chances
While we search for the answers we be smoking them cancer sticks
Police provoking motherfuckers we dancing
And we be dodging them bullets they be popping off at us, shit
But yet we always romance the street
And fall in love with the hood until somebody come blast the heat
Always up to no good, so all of my fam could eat
See in the hood we hungry - hey nigga we playing for keeps
My soldiers on the block get on it
It be good if you flaunt it, we will take if we want it
See niggas from the ghetto got a different state of mind
With a different kind of hustle and we iller with the grind
And develop our muscle until we sicker with the shine
In the struggle, thus our money come quicker doing crime
I see the way we rep the hood, gotta love me
You can take me out the ghetto, but you can't take it from me
Gotta love it

Hustle hard, try to get money quick (In the ghetto)
That's where I got my name from
I learned to get money and I got all my game from (In the ghetto)
That's where you eat with a bunch of the wolves
And get to hustling as hard as you could (In the ghetto)
Until your cake stacking shit'll get good
Throw a block party for the whole hood (In the ghetto)
With them burnout cellys
Talk crazy, sell drugs in front of Pancho Deli
Crackhead chicks still smuggle babies in they belly
And then piss in elevators 'til the lobby all smelly (In the ghetto)
That's where I keep my ratchets
Get my instincts and survival tactics
Ain't nothing like the hood nigga, I don't care
You surviving in the ghetto you can make it anywhere
Gotta love it


To my East coast niggas - rep your ghetto
West coast niggas - rep your ghetto
Midwest niggas - rep your ghetto
Down South niggas - rep your ghetto

You'll always find a good chick to hold a brick for they dude
Behind the bullshit, me and my clique on the move
We honor the code of the street, and live by the rules (In the ghetto)

Find the most crooks and they sell the most drugs at
Where you find beautiful women and

And though I'm blessed, I still got to handle the things I go through
It's good to have a friend, with another perspective to show you
Someone you know that knows you and gives you motivation
Someone that you can go to and vent your frustrations
We always talk about our peeps, how we be everywhere
When you need them the most are they really ever there?
See, every thing be all good when we be having fun
The difference is really needing a friend than having one
It's good when your peoples are there to help your problems
And help you smile about it while finding a way to solve them
Look at here, let me keep it at 100 and let me tell you
How you hold me down is something I genuinely value
I got a clearer view
And being that you're always here for me I'll be here for you

I made a decision
Despite all the things that we go through
I'm going to take my time with you
And be a friend indeed
I made a decision
That everything's gon' be alright
Going to stay strong and keep it tight
I'll be there indeed

Well, how you been baby? But I'm sayin'
Even though we probably link up every now and then
With minimal convo, look it's real good to see you friend
Something I realize is that I don't even have to mention
Is whether or not you got me, that's something that I never question
Sometimes I feel that the people that I love don't appreciate me
And some hate to see the shit I've been going through lately
See you was here, when it started to haywire
You're still here, walking with me going through the fire
And I really love you for it, I know you all relate too
On everything that I believe and I appreciate you
And just for that, it don't matter you can put that on my name
The way you rep me, let me be there just for you the same
Sometimes the pressure and the pain, it be wearing me out
But I thank you for just being there and for hearing me out
I got a clearer view
I thank God that you've been there for me, I'm here for you

I made a decision
Despite all the things that we go through
I'm gon' to take my time with you
And be a friend indeed
I made a decision
Everything's gon' be alright
Going to stay strong and keep it tight
I'll be there indeed
I made a decision

I look in your eye and I see the pain in it
Life's a game, maybe the game did it
I know I changed, they say the fame did it
Life has changed, maybe the game did it
Two friends, now in two different places
And the mister catching planes, and you catching cases
Friendship, we never based it on position
No matter the game, we both shared the same vision
Decisions to split us in the place that life seemed to hit us
I would come to town and never get up, with you
Around then, things weren't so simple
I had my own issues that I was trying to get through
Outside chatter, messing with our mental
On the chase of funds, trust, you can't forget to
It's the real friends, that you've got to tend to
No matter how far, just know that I'm with you

I made a decision
Despite all the things that we go through
I'm going to take my time with you
And be a friend indeed
I made a decision
That everything will be alright
Going to stay strong and keep it tight
I'll be there indeed
I made a decision...",https://genius.com/Busta-rhymes-decision-lyrics

See me when I pull up to the curb, little nigga
My money absurd, little nigga
While I count it all, please do not disturb, little nigga
Hey, these niggas got it mixed up
Watch how they bring us all them bottles of that pink stuff
Look, you niggas better get your chips up
You already know my style nigga, King Tut
My money pound nigga, King Tut
You could see it in my smile nigga, King Tut
My jewelry look wild nigga, King Tut
Who else be riding through the town in a Brinks truck

Yo, yo, see the way I take over Casinos like De Niro said
Reachin' money short, watch how it fold up like a Hero bread
Nigga thought he was a Super-friend, now that hero dead
Try to cross this shit, we represent, but that's a zero dread
All of this money I be countin'
And my cup runneth over like a fuckin' water fountain
Any nigga trynna front, I'mma show them shit that's ugly
Throwin' bread until they jealous of your money, lookin' funny
Hold up!
And body shit, that's what a monster do
See me throwin' this money and bitches like a sponsor do
Put the gloves on and beat up a nigga like I'm Kostya Tszyu
And fuck the talkin', just bring me my money like a prostitute


Okay, I'm ridin' through your city, blowin' diddies of that icky
Got your wifey in the passenger, I'm ridin', now she lick me
I get money like Mark Cuban and know my bank is heavy
And I grip the 31 like Jason Terry when I'm shootin
ATM in my jeans, bank sittin' on my left thigh
Burn a mansion down and watch it coverin' my left eye
Girl on deck, I just whipped another lick
Now my trap look like black Friday, twelve AM in front of Best Buy
Haha, sour got me all sedated
Niggas lookin' at me angry, what's with all the smiley faces?
My deniro like Shapiro, I see Johnny Cochran wages
I'm no lawyer, but they only bring them bottles by the cases


Okay now stupid ass stacks in my pocket
Test me, best be faster than a rocket
I ain't got no time if it ain't about a profit
If you send me my deposit, I will have your city rockin'
I get the hottest beats, niggas wish that they could rhyme on it
I got the hottest watch, ain't even set the time on it
The way I'm killin' niggas it look like a crime, don't it?
I got the light, with a little bit of lime on it
Okay, now stupid ass stacks in my pocket
Whip clean, jet ski attached to the Charger
Bitches want attention and I tell 'em try harder
Got 'em doin' shit I know that's gon' be disgracin' they father

Don’t Get Carried Away,The Big Bang,2006.0,"Doctor, yeah
I think we got some shit for 'em (FLIP-MODE!)
Yeah I'mma rub these sticks together
Check it, and start a bonfire

And if you don't see it y'all niggas can't fuck with our
Flipmode Movement - bounce in your truck to us
Y'all get stupid - don't try to fuck with us
Because you will get carried away, yeah you'll get carried away

Now I'm subtle, once I pick up my metal
Put my foot on the pedal, ridin' through every ghetto
Analyze the shit I'm seein' when I sip Amaretto
A lot of bitches on the strip, struttin' in they stilettos
Then they wave and say hello, when my Lambo' is yellow
Everything they got a jingle when they walk like ah-Jello
See the niggas on the corner and I never forget it
And I never regret it because I see how you get it
Now because of you niggas, I'm a hustler nigga
'Gnac guzzler nigga, rip your jugular nigga
In the night I become the type to love when it's dark
Cause when I pull up and park, is when I'm makin my mark
See the fact's that I'm tryin' to strive and capitalize in
Start to max-a-mimize and b-build a ent-ter-prise
And wh-while I'm stockin' this bread, keep ah-stockin' the lead
And leave a permanent dot, on the top of your head

And if you don't see it y'all niggas can't fuck with our
Flipmode Movement - bounce in your truck to us
Y'all get stupid - don't try to fuck with us
Because you will get carried away, yeah you'll get carried away

Ill Will, Flip-mooode!
I'm the Enigma, there is none harder, smarter
Martyr, Godfather, my entrance, your departure
Pardon Dre this beat is a monster, catchy
Like sleepin under open windows that's drafty
Then wakin' up my throat scratchy, that's how I spit it nasty
They short, a few inches North of a dwarf
My flow's Murciélago, ghostin' them narcos
Toastin' the ways of the original Pablos
Still a pyramid architect, mix liquors like a chemist
Killer lyricist, poetical tyrant
Sneaker store terrorist, Mt. Everest I climbed it
Heat is drawn, no creepin on me whenever I'm bent
My mind spray, my nine spray
And freak styles like 3000 Andre
To keep pilin, keep pushin them drops
Nas, runnin with hot Busta Bust, we don't stop

And if you don't see it y'all niggas can't fuck with our
Flipmode Movement - bounce in your truck to us
Y'all get stupid - don't try to fuck with us
Because you will get carried away, yeah you'll get carried away

Now I'm hot, and we runnin the block
Watch me run in your spot, fiends comin in flocks
Add a little cut to the coke when I'm cookin the pot
DRUGS, BITCH! I got what you want come and get what I got
Now I almost forgot, I come to close up your shop
I love to fold up a knot, love totin the Glock
Helps me feel safer when niggas try to scheme on my plot
Try to steal paper from me you gotta deal with a lot
See I will leave you to rot, only defendin my stock
Niggas know they pussy and struggle to pretend that they not
Lose your life in the drop, while I harvest the crop
My hot shit; bust a cannon have you run in your socks
See we live on the edge, bang shit with a sledgehammer
Split up your head, kill a snitch for the feds
Let's go, for the streets I'm always spittin a gospel
Get Nas holdin a barrel size of elephant nostril

And if you don't see it y'all niggas can't fuck with our

Welcome to Hot-and-Hazyville
It make you wanna dance 'til you break your heels
I know you love the way the God make you feel
Now watch me get deeper than a Navy Seal (Navy Seal?)
It got a crazy feel, shit feel like you in a danger field
Hypnotize, stuck it in her, daze for real

Ill Vibe,The Coming,1996.0,"My rhymes create life like the birds and the bees
Make Funkmaster Flex say 'Yo, I'm feeling these'
Flows make you shit in your drawers. Change your dungarees
Smoking trees, getting cottonmouth, wild munchies
Bounce down the block, eat food at Luigi's
Ass constipated—too much extra cheese
But anyway, while I was cooling down at Luigi's
I met some Siamese twins from overseas.. Lebanese
Lesbians with the friends from New Orleans
They had a fifth friend, she was straight Black-Portuguese
Pretty palm-olive-soaped skin, Aloe Vera leaves
She looked like the type of chick you only see in fantasies
The type of chick you would KILL for to get between the knees
Yo. I made time to chill with Miss Portuguese
Would you believe the bitch tried to steal my fucking house keys
And rob me for my G's
Had to show this crazy broad I mastered my degrees and my Ph.D's
Got your face on camera; motherfucker say cheese
You better get with your friends quick, before I start to squeeze
Getting caught up in that freaky gold-digger Jamborees
]
I caught that ill vibe Tip  yo yo word
That ill vibe Tip  yo yo word
Cause when I'm in the place you know my shit be absurd
 Word Tip? 
 Word Tip? 
 Word Tip? 

I got weight on my shoulders in the form of this beat
Ain’t nothin' sweet, on the street, for good deeds I compete
Come on complete, and unique, so get back in your stance
We enhance and we're playing the whole world circumstance
So do good in your hood even though you puff lah
Positive to comply
Don’t screw face and act rah
Progress, don't fall back. We can't have that
I'll hold your hand, Black
We can't wind up with scratch
I put my best foot forward as I play this life
'Cause this world is bound to get ya like a double-edged knife
In the jam we regulate, 'cause we organize
Logic-a-lly thinking when along's enterprise
A lot of brothers from the ghetto got the gift of gab
Peace to the West Coast and the East, we fab
Need I make mention that the crew we've got
Make things get hot, like the FoFo shot. Blaow!
No, we don't promote no guns, but don't turn that cheek
In the world that we live, kindness is viewed as weak
So, we got to stay on point for all these lizards and snakes
Some of them come as friends; some of them come as Jakes
We decipher all the frauds and build grounds with our friends
Why's that?
So we can live right until time ends
Yo, why's that?
Amalgamate, so we can get these ends
Yo, true that

Leaving them three apostles scheming, see when, BIG fuck a bitch
BIG duck a bitch quick fast
Dick to ass, don’t hesitate to split fast

Thats why nut is drippin all over your body!
You know what’s up!

Bitches always see me and they can’t understand how I once a little boy and became a man

One by one I knock you out, bitches
One by one I knock you out, bitches

Stopping and than I drop it, and pop em, dig up all in your ass bag

The meter running hoping shawty paying the damn tab
She how the ass drag
This shit big, thats why we fuck em New York all the way down to Baghdad
Stabbing the pussy and jabbing like I’m Zab Judah
And plummet her pussy with plungers like I’m Roto Rooter
Beat the pussy til the shit flab
And wear it out til it swole and the coochie smelling like king crab
This type of dick is something this bitch never had
And make her swollow the dick til the bitch gag

Strive to put an end to all this reckless driving

Chillin' on the scene, smokin' pounds of green
Ooh-wee, you see, the ugliest
Money-hungriest, Brooklyn Loch-Ness
Nine millimeter cock test, wan fi' test?
And the winner is, not that thinner kid
Bandanas, tattoos

By now you figure, he talkin 'bout that nigga
But your weak-ass assumptions, lead lead to dumpin'
IV to pumpin', you're feeling something
Catch my drift, or catch my four-fifth lift
At least six inches, above project fences
Turn meat to minces, jumps turn to flinches
When I rain I drenches, cleared your park benches
Missed you by pinches, your talk is senseless
Actor needs chiropractor, for cracked jaw
Yes I rocked, your chatterbox
Dangerous you're not, I gets down
Twist your body round and round, upside down

Is the love really there? (Is it?)
Do a thug shed the same tear? (Never know)
Throw your ice in the the air, we here

Do a thug shed the same tear? (Never know)
Throw your ice in the the air, we here
And we all gon' ball 'til the courts up here
Don't give a fuck what them niggas think we talk in here

Uh, smoke a little then we cut coke a little
And we skim a little off of the top
Taking you back when niggas use to snort coke
And toast through the hood and cry up to
Be the richest folk to float through the hood
Niggas doin' real good, it was evident
In the testament, 
when coke flow was good
When Ronald Reagan was president
The say no to drugs grown greatly irrelevant
Niggas gettin caught with bricks
But still reaching the settlement
Niggas get a one to three
Come home in twelve months
Run up and take a niggas shit
Leave 'em with twelve lumps
I've never been so willin'
To put the thoughts of mo killin'
Into manufacturing a flow so bone chillin'
Icy with a pistol, nigga
Shit glitter like ball room chandelier with crystal, nigga
I stack money as we live life simple
In the corner of the club sippin' on a Harvey Bristol, nigga
C'mon, modern day gangsta shit
And die slow as we give you niggas cancer shit, c'mon

Than courts in Miami water got shit federal

Head back long crossed 8 mile to become the boss enforce the Laws
You want some motherfuckin' hoes there keep it steppin'
No discount player no fuckin' credit
No shorts, I came to Governor lost (damn)
I came to price the dime bribe source
You had a devil smokin with them rebels
We kill for money and power
Extortionin' in my own hood and that shit's power

Stick you for your blue Range Rover
I told ya, Rampage a real live soldier
Been in the game, since the age of thirteen
A microphone fiend, so I'm gonna see my P.O
It's August the 1st, so I guess I'm a Leo
My P.O., look like Vanessa Del Rio
She pulled my rap sheet, just like Neo Geo (
Hahahaaa

I always roam through the forest just like a brontosaurus
Born in the month of May so my sign is Taurus
Kick you in your face like my fuckin' name was Chuck Norris
Make you sing my chorus
Rock to the beat and then, turn into a walrus
You remain nameless, my victory remains flawless
Acting like you wild, but I know you really harmless
While your time is coming, I make the fat shit regardless
Many niggas wanna know when the Ramp return
Yo I'm gettin' phone calls from that nigga Howard Stern
He wants to know about my Flipmode clique
The way we get down and bust niggas shit
LP after LP, we make G's
I run up in your ganks den take you for your keys
I'm not lying or joking, you get broken
Dead in Flatbush, back to Roanoke and...
People always askin' me, how your shit be sellin'
For makin' shit guaranteed to bust your fuckin' melon
Police throwed me up on charges like I was a felon
There was no tellin', when I would strike and had you swellin'
Cruisin' in my Lands, watch the police how they be gellin'
Lock you up for days and got a nigga ass smellin'
Yo, fuck that! You best believe there ain't no time for dwellin'
If you ain't makin' noise you need to kill the fuckin' yellin'

One two three we gon' turn it out
And make you rock to the beat and then scream and shout
We gonna hit you with the shit we got here
We gonna blow your mind (Blow your mind)

Busta Rhymes
]
Yo, yo, yo I run up in your set like a New York City...
I can't slip, I beat you down with my vice grip
You're lost, that means you way off course
No remorse, I'm gettin' five in The Source
I be saddleback riding motherfuckers like a horse
Turn and toss, niggas all up in my applesauce
Watch me reinforce, my shit feel good like intercourse
Ever since I was a shorty rockin' Hugo Boss
Ayo Bussa Bus (
What?
) you just made my day
If you didn't put me on I'd be locked like O.J
Now I'm writin' rhymes hittin' shorties every day
In the full runnin' drinkin' ice Tanqueray
I don't eat pork I take a fish fillet
Now I'm knockin' out niggas from ... to ... touche!
Now I'm goin' back around the way
I'm rippin' shit, like my name was Marvin Gaye
Yo, now I'm back with more Bionic like my name was Colt Seavers
Got you niggas open like a bunch of wide receivers
Time is on the meter, go clean your act up in the cleaners
Chickenhead, give me some of your chicken fajitas
Yo, I beg your pardon, I write my rhymes way past the margins (Margins)
Squeeze the Charmin, peace to one million men marchin' (Yah)
When you talk shit you really don't know what you startin'
Now your shit is done like a fuckin' empty milk carton
It's on for the 9-6, mad shows at the Ritz
Now we got you open like Vicks
Stickin' to your stomach like Quaker Oat Grits
Fisherman hat with my brand new kicks
On the low, I still rock my Girbauds
See the show, I got my nickel plated .44
All my rough niggas open the do'
'Cause Boy Scout brings the ruckus and I'm still hardco'
Yo, when I walk streets you know my blade's a little sharper
Fuck Peter Parker, I cross you like a magic marker
Every time I hit I always hit a little harder
Blazing to the point where niggas look a little darker
Catching suntans from my music, fans understand
Making fat shit, I always love to lend a helping hand
Organized rhyme unit like the Poison Clan
While your ride is busted, I be your luxury Sedan
Number one nigga in the chain of command
Breakin' fool in school like my nigga Geechie Dan
Ayyyyyo, I see intruders on my scan
Singin' at your funeral like Bobby ""Blue"" Bland

One two three we gon' turn it out
And make you rock to the beat and then scream and shout
We gonna hit you with the shit we got here
We gonna blow your mind (Blow your mind)
Keep it movin' like this, keep it movin' like that
If I die, I'ma only come back
Yo, I'm saying if you think that you can step to me wrong
Don't even waste your time

Huge rechargable batteries, bitch I'm tweaking, only
Short circuit electric chair bolteses every feature Coly

Fuck a blunt bitch I'm inhaling muffles and smoke from buses
I defend my money like soldiers I come to punish
Defence mechanism from infections, the way that BUSS IS

No Spinderella just plenty metal for any fellow
Semi settle everything for me and everything for me
Smoking on that G13 and everything funny

Blood gang 6 flags niggas, no rollercoaster

Where’s My Money,Grand Theft Auto IV Soundtrack,2008.0,"Motherfucker, where
Where my fucking money, money, money?
Bitch, where my fucking money?
Ayo, Green, I feel like I'm turning green too
From Bill Bixby to some Incredible Hulk shit
I don't even know why you give me shit like this to spit to
I'm sure we speak the same language
Fuck you bitches, pay me

Wait a minute, came to go get it, ranger fitted
Whenever it come to paper, better know I'm major with it
Make it rain a major blizzard, leather alligator lizard
I Talledega race any challenger; name a digit!
Even if on the slightest, you take a smidget
Or dare touch my revenue, I'll slice you with the razor, quit it!
Icy till I make it frigid, burr
The laws of physics says it's getting cold
My money taller than a hall of midgets
I get up all up in it, 
kicking down the door, who is it?
Bitch, I be the crew of bill collectors, pay them all a visit
After cleaning bank accounts you questioned
If I gave a shit, if not I tell the truth
So you could tell 'em that the player did it
It's OK, I say a prayer, it's the mayor bitch slayer
Giving you another layer of the data trick

Bust Rhymes, hitting you with punch lines
Funny how I fuck dimes
Bitch, you know I want mine
Where my fucking money?

I ain't speaking foreign, you know what I'm sayin'
Better have my bread, nigga, I ain't playin'
Bitch, where my fucking money?
Mark every word spoken
Reddish so you're pussy if you think I'm jokin'
Motherfucker, where my fucking money?
Think I still ain't crazy ‘cause I cut my dreads
And if you short my cake, I'm off side of your head
Bitch, where my fucking money?

Critical, it's pitiful, I'm cynical
How I deliver lyricals and take these other niggas paper
Topsy-tervy controversy, I'm so thirsty, got no mercy
For some of these bitches, I collect my money now and later
Keep it moving with the clique
While making bitches hit the strip
Cake up everyday I wake, I rate the way my money flip
I want it's mine, borderline, call it crime
All the shine I'm taking it, ain't no mistaking it
Nigga, what's yours is mine
No need to second guess it, check it, I'm the gloss and grind
The gritty and the floss, the profit and the loss, all intertwined
Because I profit from your losses
You don't want it, you should get it
In the hood with your money, I extended my line of credit
The medic, doctor rhymes that put you on a diuretic
Shrinking up a nigga pockets, simple niggas style pathetic

Bust Rhymes, hitting you with punch lines
Funny how I fuck dimes
Bitch, you know I want mine
Where my fucking money?

I ain't speaking foreign, you know what I'm sayin'

I'm big like a movie, I'm on the screen and at the cinema

I'm bag a couple bitches, and then I throw 'em in my videa
Yeah, yeah, the God of the block
Y'know me killa had you spreadin' the spot wet and twist it like Olivia
Oh shit, flow so sicker than Chlamydia
We know you a slouch duke, we don't even consider ya
Boss nigga, see or hear me in ya area
The more niggas, the murders, the more the money, the more the merrier
Smash shit 'til everything become mass hysteria
Hungry for street shit, see I be takin care of ya check nigga
Fuck all the talk, homey I'm daring ya
The lead from the shot'll poison ya blood like malaria
Maybach Excelero exotic
Worm skin interior, my swagger to my bitch to my money
It's all superior

Check it my nigga.. most of you muhfuckers amateur
I muster the nigga quick and damage any challenger
But now y'know, ""Oh a nigga flow so spectacular""
Break niggas down and handle you muhfuckin characters
Captain of this shit but most of you niggas is passengers
I'm takin it back to the hood, like '87 Maximas
Yeah, yeah y'know who the truth, no need for askin the, same question again
To get the same answer bruh, fasten ya seatbelt
Bitches fuck wit the bachelor
Wit' money like a thousand coke deals from here to Panama
Strike like a brightness, a light.. I'm here to dazzle ya
Whole hood from the boroughs, to the niggas up in Attica
Soldiers in the streets, the Middle East, way down to Canada
When it comes to the block, y'know I'm the ambassador
Follow nobody's footsteps, but said it like a scavenger
Wanna talk money bitch!? Then holla at my manager
The way y'all niggas is trash, my crew'll get to blasting ya
Twelve shot clip, hollow tips, quick to plaster ya
All over the cement, spread ya like I'm mashing
Everything, Bus-a-Bus date... but check ya fuckin calendar!

Been Through the Storm,The Big Bang,2006.0,"Been through the storm, through the cold and rain
Everything's still the same
Can't control how I feel
Sometimes it's hard to keep it real
You see the luxuries in life, with the fortune and fame
Like them Cadillacs with sunroofs mayne
So many ways to make a dollar
Huh, sometimes I think about my father
You see my poppa was broke, and my momma was young
Tryin to blend in with them city folk
Every day landlord knockin down my do'
Wonderin where my next blessing is comin from

My momma and poppa, moved to the U.S. as Jamaicans
Struggled to get visas and green cards through immigration
Though my pop was po', stayed away from crime and malice
Hard living gave him hard hands and callous
As a young'n, peep how much they loved each other's space
His hard hands rubbin against the pretty skin of my mother's face
Dig for treasure 'til his hands looked like hands of a junkie
So coarse, slap a mule and take the life from a donkey
On the other hand, mommy was the type to work two jobs
Never enough money, that's why I got your whole crew robbed
Got older, developed ways of grippin the steel
Barely home for me to see her, or get a good cooked meal
Seek refuge in the alleged land of the free, lookin
Blendin in with city folk, down in Flatbush Brooklyn
Feel a little of my pain, follow and sing to it
Homey I seen it all, if you ain't knowin I been through it
In other words I


Got a little older, late teens, me and my crew would huddle
On the corner late nights, plottin to escape struggle
Nights got cold and still would hustle in the same place
In front of Pancho Delis, now the freeze up on a nigga face
1987 Reaganomics ever curious
To visit other cities, out of town kick was serious
Guayanese jeans bounce, put whatever slinger on
Whatever slinger came back, quickly brought me right along
Nigga ran away from home
Doin different wild shit, just to put a pair of Filas on, 'Didas on
Wreck is all for the good, gettin into shit
Like we innocent, actin older than we should
Walk around broke in the hood, watchin all the rich niggas
These younger thugs who try to choke and try to get niggas
Thinkin 'bout my mom and pop, while I'm monopolizin
To hell with just gettin by and economizin
It's kinda hard bein humble in the belly of struggle
Doin things that probably get you in trouble
That's why we stay up on the block, gettin money while we keepin it safe
In front of churchgoers keepin the faith
Mom and pop be worryin for they son
Despite they struggle and their honest livin look and see just what I become
A scavenger, in brute pursuit to be happy, another young'n that's wildin
Across the line until somebody tryin to cap me - ohhhh shit {*gunfire*}

I been through the storm

Bang you on your head so hard, shit be formin callouses
Let me get this loot so we can move up in these palaces

Take your fat finger out your nose
You should just pay attention, and watch how I wild on records
Make you sing, ""The Lord is my shepherd!""

Hit you with magic like my name was Pocahontas
The dread, gon' make you party til you dead

Put your head to bed -- let me do my thing -- nuff said
Shit so hot make your chickenhead do the spread
Tell me what you said -- I said I never leave you misled
While you bullshit, I'd rather get the lucci instead

Whylin in your whip, til you crash into a brick wall
Through the nine-six, I be that nigga that be priceless
Always blowin up your spot, bringin more surprises
You, you know you really need to come clean
Let me do my thing, don't you even try to intervene
I will endanger your species like an ostrich
Hold you hostage, and crazy feed you swine sausage
HAH! I be the number one chosen just to keep you open
Chill with your thoughts I got your brain frozen
Pay the prices made the needed sacrifices
To present the grand opening of Flipmode Enterprises

Watch me get down and just do my thing baby

We Could Take It Outside,When Disaster Strikes...,1997.0,"That's that joint (You know that ain't doin it again)
Uh, do it! Do it!

I'm a Natural Born Killa that's Born to Rise
Flipmode is da Squad so it's no surprise
Niggas want to advertise about how we get down
You fuck around: leave your body in the lost and found
How you like me now?
We got the industry on lock
The world is on shock
I'm a take a piece of the rock
Yo, you feel it in the heart when we took you to the park
Midnight after dark, I'm the raider of the lost ark (ark echo's)

Now na na na na na na, na na nah
Super size, super size, right before your eyes
I bring in treats like giant sweet potato pies
Wise, sword shift and I spit on flies
Killing all the tips from studio spies
Head to bed, beddie bye, beddie bye
Don't ask why. Why? What do you ask as a reply?
Flipmode's the Squad don't rest, don't try
Peace to my people in the friendly sky
Peace to my outer space ties

I'm in leather like the ladies
Bigger than crack in the 80's
 {​​​*echoes*}​​​
Drive the buggy I Mercedes
Blow up like C-4
Got so much to live for
Can't play the game no more
Pick up the cain no more
Brothers ain't the same no more
Try to sweat me, what am I aiming for
Get yourself caught up
Faggot ass tore up
In the worst way, the only way you can stop me
Is cock your Glock and shot me
Drop me, pop me, make sure you that you got me
Cause anyhow I live I'm comin back for you poppy

Ya'll niggas want something?

Push up in the hot rod, alley cats a rah rah
All my flipmode in the backseats with chrome nines
I'm here to bust mine
Nigga fragile let his brain fry
Pretty boy sliced up feel the contact from this red eye
You failed to realize when you macks me you drop the plastic
Run up in your crib and snatch the heemis from the mattress
My crew expanded, QB is where we landed
Yellow strip you crossed it
Now I'm forcing you to drink this Sham's potion
Show me were loaded
The desert eagle hear it cockin'
Lovin my doggies
While we shinin' continue flossin

(Flipmode, Flipmode) Killa kids
Flipmode we are, 'mode we are..

Fuck steppin on toes I crush the whole shoe
Pronto like Cru till I'm 
Triumphant like Wu
The shit you talkin crazy like niggas turnin in their hand guns
I be burnin MC's like Betty's grandson
Smokin 
grey poupon

Two lines, I chew rhymes and make niggas fold like they was futons

We the official g-u-rilla to lead militias
That pillage, americana
Spit sentences like, venomous iguanas
Reminisce the promise
Bring drama like Nicaragua
Fatigues march, army leaders, they count crooked drug dollars
And sip fresh squeezed milk from the titties of llamas
Leave cities in carnage
Pretty as farmers that pour whiskey at harvest and hold 16 bananas
Maintain, maintain, maintain
I reign like Mussolini's iron fists
Try on this, you can't see me like vagina lips
Smugglin diamond chips, bubblin anonymous
The dominant will resource and count on script crews and world wars

Yo, you better practice what you preach
I got 7 MC's at 10 G's a show each
Never interfere and shit, souvenirs for your ears and shit
Clear poetry like William Shakespeare and shit
Word is bond checkin me out
Hey what you talkin about
You lost and you walkin about
Niggas got beef they really want to chill and start talkin it out
Hey, oh my god, y'all nigga be buggin me out
Wish they could lay me down and have the police start chalkin me out
Now I zoom in on you and my niggas start stalkin you out
Shut down on bullshit you total recallin' about
This one's for my people and my niggas up North
The rulership dynasty of Flipmode finally come forth
Exports and imports hittin you with flavors of all sorts
My squad comin through, chop off your ear

2 niggas repping the R, X & X
My nigga, there are no raps shit
My nigga clap shit that quick
Yeah, we on that shit

About to roundhouse kick you motherfuckers face off
My voice so big you can turn the fuckin base off
Wanted for lots of murders lately - cops surround the place off
I’m busting DMX up in this bitch
You better take off

Went away for a while.. jail, prison
Getting down for real, fuck it - living!
Don’t worry about what condition I’m in
Cats can't survive half the places I’ve been

And while a lot of motherfuckers
Sit and watch the throne killer
We in the booth barking dog, welcome home
We spazzing in this bitch
While we keeping the crowd hyped
Remind em like what this
Shit's supposed to sound like
Dogg, I pulled up in front
Of the jail to picked you up
Convoy of whips with about 30 bitches in the trunk
Come on!

They saying locked down is easy
But a nigga like me is greasy
Population or PC, Check my 5 nigga
See when I’m on
Feeding with that thing, then I’m gone

Most you niggas talk too much
Putting police on ‘em
Bunch of blabbermouth-ass niggas: Jackie Gleason
I dig my foot in your face, putting my cleats on
You niggas steady watching me putting the streets on

You need to think cause
I got on and changed that something changed?
Bitch, I am the streets. What's my name
I’ve been trying to stay suckerfree
But look where the suckers be
Had the hood under me, can’t a motherfucker breathe

I know you baggage claim rapper niggas.. just carry my luggage
And I take great pleasure whenever it’s time to punish
Incinerate a rhyme, let me throw their ass in the rubbish
I don’t give fuck what they think
You niggas know that I run this
You niggas can see just what it is and how I’m on it
How I fuck your money up and be the foulest nigga

Fall back cause of all that noise you're making
Only lets me know you boys is faking
Let me know that everything
You got is mine for the takin
Before I leave you dead and stinkin
Look here, I don’t play games, I don’t say names
Jump through with the guns out spraying lames
I don’t take aim, hit the whole crowd
I shoot loud!

Ya’ll niggas know my M.O, I kill you, little boy
Heatseeker missle whistle seek and destroy
You ain't ready for the standoff
And while a dog shooting
I’m chopping a nigga's hand off
Funny little nigga, see the way I treat him
Talk shit when I whoop niggas, than I beat them
And if you run around, I woop your ass cookoo
Don't. Talk. Back. When your father's talking to you
These corny niggas is wavin surrender flag banners
Taking no prisoners, pussy, I’m teaching your ass manners
Fuck your ass up bad, more bangers
And air them out to dry
Like we left them on clothes hangers
I’m sickly as hell, eat your body up: cancer
Who's the nicest in the spot?
Ya’ll already knowing the answer
Then I listen to niggas talk
And they fill me up with laughter
These niggas say they're ""thug""
But be lookin' more like a dancer
There's something that you niggas need to know, it's so important
That I ain't the one to fuck with homey
I’m tired of talking!",https://genius.com/Busta-rhymes-otis-freestyle-lyrics
I’m a Go and Get My...,Back on My B.S.,2009,"Yeah, they call me P-Shake, I'm a number runner
And I just wanna let you know I'm getting that Arab Money
I'm getting that Chinese money
I'm getting that motherfucking British Columbia money
Nigga basically what I'm saying, your dollar ain't shit!
You feel me? And bullshit ain't nothing but chewed up grass
And that's a big black ball that come out of a cow's ass
So the next time you see that annointed bitch you know
Bend her, spin her, and go up in her, and let her know
Bitch, there is no dinner
These are the reasons and these are the numbers that I got for ya
And it's 13.. 20.. 27.. 38
25, 27, 13, 20, 27th, 38's
Doo doo do do dooooooo

I'm a go and get my *25* over on *27*
Be back in *13* minutes or even *20*
Be back with *27* niggas with them *38's*
Doo doo do do dooooooo

See there was this situation with a couple niggas I was peeping
The way they was moving analyzing the shit they was doing in the club Grilling and screwing they faces up
Front like they chilling and moved a couple paces up, playing me close
But I'm saying we most...ly be in a spot
Celebrating something and probably making a toast
Party till we probably shaking the coast
And hardly ever start a problem unless you gotta
I'm sayin we supposed to be enjoying ourself nigga
Cause we entrepreneurs and gwop connoisseurs employing ourself nigga
Exploiting my wealth with the company I'm keeping
Until a hater came and got to annointing himself to be
The one to come in it, and had a couple dudes to support him
Acting all extra like he had the thing on him
Then after we finish beating on him, now he know we ain't playing
That's when he walked away saying


Shit is really bug to me how some of these niggas they be coming
And setting theyself up till you hit them and getting theyself up
In these altercations they don't really be needing
Until it's too late, then they realize that a body part is bleeding
Instead of being out and enjoying the people
They be acting all tough, yapping and bluffing instead of being peaceful
These partially thugs be spreading like cancer
Fronting like gangsters until you bust they head now they looking like dancers
While they leaning and they rocking with after
You could've avoided *BEEF!* The shit is annoying, *CHIEF*
Cause now you got the bouncer stopping the door, killing
Nobody else is getting in cause we mopping the floor with you
Instead you could have came to party and BS and deaded the fronting
Bag you a chick, while you sipping on something
But instead you chose to do something that made us lump your shit up
For playing, now what the fuck is he saying?


Who did it?
Which one of y'all niggas hit me in my motherfuckin..
Where my earring at? Where my keys?
Why y'all them niggas hit me in my motherfuckin jaw like that?
Where my keys at? Where my shoe?
I can't find my shoe, you hit me in the jaw nigga?
Is that the one? Nah, whassup though - how you doin?
Which one of y'all niggas hit me in my jaw man?
How y'all conceal it? Somebody go call my girl
Somebody hit me in my jaw
I got Medicade nigga that's alright
Y'all hit me in my motherfuckin jaw like that
I tell y'all, y'all pussy, don't feel it
Nigga I got a brother that's a Crip
Nigga I got another brother that's a Blood
We gon' tear this motherfucker up y'all niggas hit
Y'all done hit the wrong nigga now!!
Y'all hit the wrong nigga!!
Y'all gon' sit there and let.. I'mma sue this club!
I'm suin this muh'fuckin club cause y'all security guards

Motherfuckers ain't never seen nothing like this before
For real man
It's goin' down, baby, uh
Unh, Busta Rhymes
(WHAT!) Unh, DMX nigga
Unh, unh, unh, unh, unh

I see ghosts clearly; even though, most don't hear me
They still wanna get near me (Unh!), fear me, so I'm leary
Kinda eerie what I'm feelin' (What!), from the floor, to the ceilin'
Straight through the roof, want the truth?
I kinda miss robbin' and stealin' (C'mon!)
'Cause it kept a nigga hungry, only eatin' when I starved (Unh!)
I was ugly, so I robbed, no one loved me, shit was hard (C'mon!)
Went to God once in a while when it got a little too hectic
He was the only one I knew that I respected (Why?)
Didn't know why, didn't know what I was livin' was a lie
If I ain't shit, then, why should I try? (Unh!)
See, plenty niggas die, over dumb shit, up in the hood
Real good heart, but up to no good (Damn!)
Thought I did what I could, but I guess it wasn't enough (Uh-huh)
The Devil told me it would happen
But I kept callin' his bluff (Uh-huh)
When it rains it pours now, my pains are yours
As yours are what's mine, define, revolvin' doors (Nigga!)

Because we Gods nigga (And) we go the yard nigga
Because I walk the ground under my feet
And keep it live and stay in tune with the street
Now let me ask my niggas (why?)

Unh, yo, they say the good die young, in the hood where I'm from
I only got one question to that, why the fuck am I here?
I look to the air, ask God, ""Love me, please""
But in reality, only people that hug me is thieves
Same niggas that send shots through my rugby sleeves
They wanna slug me and leave, I'm thinkin' it must be me
Please shed light, the hood's dark
I did my dirt but got a good heart
Shouldn't that count for somethin'?
I was told I'd amount to nothin'
Most of my childhood life by folks that was stuntin' my growth
Separated me from the shit I was wantin' the most
Felt myself comin' close to pumpin' them O's
Lump in my throat, chest poked out, face was poker
Tryin to, erase my ghostses, chase the smokers
Got demons on both shoulders
Tryin to chauffeur my life through the streets
In other words, nigga, my will was weak
Please feel what I speak
This ain't your average ordinary jargon weak rap niggas be talkin'
This shit is deep, from the mind of Busta, X, and me
To all my fallen soldiers, rest in peace, 'til we meet, niggas

(Why?) All my niggas tell me (why) tell me, ah! (we die)
'Cause we crazy with it, quick to blaze you with it (Ha!)
From in my soul to every word that I curse
With all the agony expressed in this verse (Ha!)
Let me ask my niggas (why?)
My niggas tell me (why) tell me, ah! (we die)
Because we Gods, nigga (And) we go the yard nigga
Because I walk the ground under my feet (Huh! Ha!)
And keep it live and stay in tune with the street
Now let me ask my niggas (why?)

I must be cuckoo, like I respect the new-you, never
See you too could get it through your FUBU sweater
Like a nigga when he walk in the dark, trespassin'
On a nigga land, shots echo loud in the park
I live and die for all the shit I believe
And rep for everything I stand for
With every single breath I breathe
Like the intake from cigarette smoke, it's like you inhale
The demon in the gutter stressed struggled and broke
If the shit was all over tomorrow, I'd leave a treasure
For my kids with a legacy for my children to follow
You know it's funny how the good die first
Get the peppin' in your steppin' faggot, nigga
'Cause you could die worse
Hold on, you know I cut off my arm, in the name of reppin'
Real niggas in the midst of droppin' this bomb
Allah blessin' me to rep for the better, and carry on
Something great and keep a nigga name livin' forever
Now tell me!

The nations of the civilized world will collapse under the impressive weight of parasitic political conspiracies which remove all hope & optimism from their once faithful citizens
Around the globe, generations of polluters will be punished for their sins
Un-shielded by the ozone layer they have successfully depleted
Left to bake in the searing naked rays of light
Wholesale assassinations served to destabilize every remaining government
Leaving the starving & wicked to fend for themselves
Bloodthirsty renegade cyborgs created by tax-dodging corporations wreck havok
Pissed off androids tired of being slaves to a godless & gutless system, where the rich get richer & the poor get fucked over and out
Unleash total worldwide destruction by means of nuclear holocaust
Annihilating the terrified masses
Leaving in its torturous wake nothing but vicious, cannibalistic, mutated, radiating, and horribly disfigured hordes of satanic killers
Begged on revenge, but against whom?
There are so few left alive
Starvation reigns supreme, forcing unlucky survivors to eat anything & anyone in their path
Massive earthquakes crack the planets crust like a hollow eggshell
Causing unending volcanic eruptions
The creatures of the seven seas, unable to escape the certain death upon land, boil in their liquid prison
Disease then circles the earth, plagues & viruses with no known cause or cure
Laying waste to whatever draws breath, and human-kind having proven itself to be nothing more than a race of ruthless scavengers
Fall victim to merciless attacks at the hands of interplanetary alien tribes who seek to conquer our charred remains
This is, Extinction Level Event
The Final World Front, and there is only, one, year, left
Wow, that's cool, I can't hardly wait!
You don't have to, because here it is

Callin' all live niggas
Callin' all live bitches
We got a job for y'all on planet earth

(Verse 1)
While we continuously stay sculpturin bombs
Love unconditional greetings with opening arms
And for my worthy niggas I'mma die tryin for y'all
With the blessing of an angel's tear cryin' for y'all
Back to the foundation, takin you under back where it all started
With a whole new beginnin and a brand new hunger
Starvin to where my skin was suffocatin my ribs
Now we got bitches interior decoratin my crib
Touch the love I got like you holdin my heart in your hand
And watch my manifesto, shit was all a part of the plan
The fashion that I choose to deal with this shit
Sometimes it's so hard to describe the passion that I feel for this shit
How many struggles I survived just to eat this meal
Never thought y'all meet a nigga that could be this real
Flipmode up in this bitch now let me make you aware
Too late for turnin back my nigga cause we takin it there


Genesis, Genesis, Genesis
And leave!
(Verse 2)
And leave a mark until it's deep in the floor
Y'all niggas fucked up never should've let let me get my feet in the door
And then I step through, FUCK wipin my feet at the door
I be the deacon I'm beatin niggas and speakin the raw
Strictly raw shit is what niggas be seekin me for
Testin my strength, that's what the devil's try to weaken me for
C'mon, yes and y'all off to the next step.. for sure
Rep and make you wanna accept more
Niggas analyze the jewel that I reveal in a rhyme
I'm like somethin that has evolved about a million times
Peep the display with all the new features
The way we really doin it, these mu'fuckas probably wouldn't believe us
Flipmode Squad by all means, a pledge of allegiance
With the great feelin of people like the comin of Jesus
While a lot of other niggas don't be tellin you nothin
That be the same bullshit that's always pushin my buttons
Godly is how we rep this undeniable force
You like a weak preacher, swearin smacked dead on a cross
Kick niggas like the two back legs of a horse
Chop ya fingers for tryin' to put your hands in the sauce
Sometimes I think that it would be best if you run
And do yourself a favor, cause you got your whole life ahead of you son!
A whole new thang startin for me
Smell so much ass in a spot, the beat got the world fartin for me
When I spit you know I always love to garnish it hard
While you love-it hate-it niggas trying to tarnish the God
I know some dudes that would love to bring the hatred to y'all
While I continue to bless you with shit that's is sacred to y'all
Even if I had to bend you in place
I always put it down and rep my niggas from the most genuine place
From my street corner niggas to my live niggas everywhere
Too late for turning back, we takin it there

Take the track, cut the heads off, split it down the middle, man
Take the bones out, man, for real
Yeah, all apple pie, yeah
Straight up, Flipmode, BK king

It was the best heist since ice, precise rituals
Skated outta Jacob's wit' the Fruit Loop jewels
Holdin' a navy blue Suzi, Krush Groovin' waves off the atlas
Coolin', that's how we make movies
Basketball gun brawlers, bounce
Black down 'bill-a-head banks, Malibu colorful shanks
That's the way we live, Staten Island kid
O-Doggin' it, the thug vaccine wit no pork in it
Vivid imagination paper chain
Dufflebag swollen, we holding Drink chocolate milk before we roll in
It's like that ya'll, we gangstas
Stickin all you Bay Ridge Benzes I'm out to get erect
Terrific shit be the diamond district
Tiffany's, pretty Valentine brick is on the second floor balcony
Gems is magnificent, diamonds is cryin
""Busta Rhymes take me, nevermind them!""

Ayo, caught 'em at the Ice Pavilion, dressy, salad bar style; Nestle
Four white niggas, covered in vest pieces
Think like a mob flick Guessin like Patsy in the mask, piece bust
Got aggravated, slapped the glass piece
One nigga beamin, faggot ass
Lay on the floor ya fuck! Tied his broken arm to his Hush Puppies
Wrapped around trauma, everything realer than fuck
Tajuana left my nigga niece live comma
Three young Italians, suited down personal style
I'm in valour white designin on the 'dallions
Felt like some crackers was in back of me
Spit on the clerk, pass the Harry Winston set ghost backin me
Bust a shot, motored, four mill in paper work Lord
We get together once more before we blow this
Murdered nobody, left em all baseball'd down, brotha
Three wicked ass 6's, Gucci colors

Money! Drop dead on the floor
Nigga, pass the keys to the door
Pass me all the cash in the drawer
Or I promise you'll be payin the price
Feelin like a nigga died twice
Execute the world's greatest diamond heist

Raekwon, Ghostface, Rocky Marce, c'mon
C'mon money, c'mon money
C'mon money, c'mon money, c'mon money

Feel like a mac bustin, a rug in Preston on percussion
I'll bust in your gate, nigga it's nothin
A hail storm, ice rainin, mind containin
Info, nigga what you in for? Complainin
Six bars deep in this language
Did I tell you how my day's spent? Speakin through the face of Ronald Regan
Iceberg History, calligraphy
Colidescope colors, hollow-head shells and flarin gunmen
Hate to see me comin like gray skies on day of judgment
Makes you wonder where the love went
Hit a nigga, feed him to some buzzards
Put up numbers, plus I'm one to push his mug in
We duck in the safe, check what I'm huggin
Rocks the size of some shit, out in the congo
My arms full, let's get the fuck out, Busta I got you

Ayo, we do great study on fossils and stones like archeologists
Gem-ologists, collect the most priceless ices anonymous
Canary stones yellow like a pumpkin
Dunkin Donut precious size stones make me wanna cut the safe open
Rae pass the blowtorch, Ghost brought the dynamite stick
Marciano brought a chisel wit an ice pick
Princess cuts, invisible settings
Plannin the world's greatest diamond heist playin a tune by Otis Redding
Icicle cones hang from the ceiling just like stalagmites
Time to throw on a skully and tie a rag tight
Throwin light went off and in the basket
Grabbed the necklace from off the satin pillow while the glass casket
Ice lay across the crushed burgandy velvet
Up in the diamond slide-tray
Gun in your face, slide it right away
Roundtable with Habib, Mirishnokof, and the rest of them Jewish niggas
We got them niggas drunk and talkin foolish see
You know the way we straight manipulated the shit
We swindle them niggas for all their precious things before we skated and shit
Yeah, ya'll niggas know we skated early
Disguised ourselves as Hasidic Jews and even left my sideburns curly
Bounce to Mexico and spend some pesos
And bury the diamonds on an island your never heard
Like Turks and Caicos
Everytime we hit, we in and out quick
Don't be surprised if we behind supplyin niggas all the platinum and shit

Aftermath
Here we go!

Back with the most venomous rap
It be the Godfather of the club banger let me hear you clap
You can applause and from the very beginnin'
You can give me a standin' ovation
While I bang your face in
With another banger, I call it a cliffhanger
Watch me mangle and strangle this whole rap shit (Come on!)
You can see the way I make 'em mad sick
From down bottom, the way I got 'em; give me my cash quick (Come on!)
Lock on; you better grab onto somethin'
Because I'm 'bout to shake shit again and make a black bitch (Cum on!)
Now you hear the shots ring off
From bitches takin' everything off—each other
Got 'em wildin', runnin' for cover
The King Kong-Big Foot-gully-with-a-skully bully of rap
Still-ugly-with-the-money runnin' the trap
Now they givin' me dap, as far as I'm concerned in this mu'fucker
Look how I got 'em, now they ready to snap

So don't touch me nigga! (You might burn yourself)
Don't touch me nigga! (You might burn yourself)
It's gettin' hot in this bitch (So throw da water on 'em)
We got 'em hot in this bitch (So throw da water on 'em)
We got 'em hot in this bitch (So throw da water on 'em)
We got 'em hot in this bitch! (So throw da water on 'em!)
Here we go!

Now you see the alcohol spillin'
And we got 'em hands in the ceilin'
You know we only come to rattle the bulidin'
And break it on down just a little, once again
Knowin' we holdin' the bank so let me keep the dice rollin'
And keep it traditional the way I keep my money fallin'
While you're slackin' on your MAC-in', Duke, we always keep it goin'
Right to the left, do it to death, now watch me
Come through with a chisel that make the game sizzle, and I—
Pull out the skillet, prepare for the cookin'
How I'm wildin'; niggas wonder when I'm gonna bring the hook in
Thug's ice grill in every time they get to lookin'
Got 'em wildin' overseas all the way back to ""Go Brooklyn!""
Now they ready to spazz 'cause we bring the best to them
Shit that shut it down on the regular, that's with the—
Fly '80s nigga that was whippin' in a Cressida
Fresher than—most of these niggas, killin' the rest of the—
Fellas that was thinkin' they was rushin' in and bustin' in
But the way we was doin', we was musclin' they hustlin'

So don't touch me nigga! (You might burn yourself)
Don't touch me nigga! (You might burn yourself)
It's gettin' hot in this bitch (So throw da water on 'em)

We got 'em hot in this bitch! (So throw da water on 'em!)
Here we go!

You don't really want it, my dude
I'm sayin' most my niggas is rude
And when we come, we eat a nigga' food
Back to the fact of the matter at hand
For me to come and control this whole shit was only part of the plan
The other part of the plan for you to understand:
That nothin' could fuck with the kid, let me say it again
The broad-backed, big Bus-a-Bus back to put out the trash
And just for the record, we got it on smash
Now, how the fuck they even got the audacity
The fire marshall come and try to talk about capacity
Every time I'm in the spot, I hope you know it has to be
Extremely packed to shut it down, you'll probably cause a tragedy
Don't you know that when I'm in the place I change the mood again
I be wildin' wit raunchy bitches and a bunch of hooligans
Now don't get it fucked up just because I flaunt it
Niggas think that they can test me, bring it if you really want it
See I be the type to always beat you to the punch faster
I keep a smile on my face, but carry the Bushmaster

So don't touch me nigga! (You might burn yourself)
Don't touch me nigga! (You might burn yourself)
It's gettin' hot in this bitch (So throw da water on 'em)

We got 'em hot in this bitch! (So throw da water on 'em!)
Keep it goin'

You already know I said it word to mother
Shit is so hot you niggas think it's cold up in the summer
Shh, calm the noise down let's get a little quiet
Cause the neighbors call the police they know we cause riots
And they know that we'll have them thinkin' they dancin' with the devil
When they play the music turn the volume to the highest level
You got it right
Let's keep the bomb goin' like we lit a stick of dynamite
Bow, you know you need to follow whenever you hear the God spit
(Aw, shit)
You see me nigga back in the cockpit
Out to gettin' this money I give you all a stock tip
Perspire by a nigga till you see the sweat drop drip

So don't touch me nigga! (You might burn yourself)
Don't touch me nigga! (You might burn yourself)

When I come through, hit y'all with the one, two
Break y'all niggas that y'all niggas won't even know what to do
Break fool, make all y'all people wanna come to
Feel the force of my shit kickin' like it was Kung Fu
Blast through, don't these corny niggas harass you
Set a tone in the streets where even the fans blast you
Ask you niggas, do y'all really want the brand new?
Corny niggas just finish your time and over, passed due
Hee, ha, what ho, think it's way passed your curfew
Hit you with some shit that make doctors come have to nurse you, you, you, you
I'm rollin' with my whole crew
Bounce through you niggas whenever we surround you

Hit you with some more hits that make y'all wanna go shit, shit, shit

Grinch 2000,Dr. Seuss’ How the Grinch Stole Christmas (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack),UnKnown,"This is a Flipmode Squad
Jim Carrey collabo
Now what?

Ugh, hallelujah
Kids hear this come on
While I'm lacing and tryna prepare this
For y'all, oh well I got a story to tell
About a dude I met once, miserable as hell
How grouchy he was
And how slouchy he was
And when he talked, you'd smell his breath
And how lousy it was
And if you daydreamed, he'd give you pinch
Now let me tell you about Mr. Grinch
Every holiday season while we was young, growing up
Everything be cool when Mr. Grinch show up
Always plottin' and schemin' to ruin everybody's holiday season
And never had a justifiable reason

Yo B I had my reason
They call me The Grinch
I tried to live the given
But it was making me winch
I see happy kids whitless
""Merry Christmas"" they shouted
I stole the gifts
And there was nothing anyone could do about it

You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You really are a heel
You're as cuddly as a cactus, (uh) you're as charming as an eel
Mister Grinch
(Busta Rhymes, Jim Carrey, Mr. Grinch)
Mister Grinch

He was an angry little dude with a horrible attitude
And he'll show you some gratitude
If you let him ruin your mood
Everybody knew about him from here to Baton Rouge
He remind me of the crazy lost cousin of Mr. Scrooge
Word to mother

Yes, it's my favorite day
You let me take all your gifts
And just yell my name!!
(MR. GRINCH)
After that I'll be on my way
Just to return and successfully ruin your day

Okay for the record
What the hell made you like that?
So grouchy and grimy
How everything about you is whack
Ay yo I know you all can tell
From all the talk from his mouth
You better set some big traps
Around the gifts in your house
State of the art surveillance
Just to give it a boost
You sleep with one eye open
With a couple wild dogs running loose, now
He's definitely not the dude you can trust
He be bouncing with all your goods
And leave you biting the dust

You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch
You really are a heel
You're as cuddly as a cactus
You're as charming as an eel
Mister Grinch, Mister Grinch

Grinch come around safe guard your things
You better safe guard your money
Safe guard your bling
You gotta safe guard your crib
Safe guard your g's
You gotta safe guard the stash and the car keys
You gotta listen up to what we talking about
Yeah it was better when the Grinch was never coming around her
Time after time again
Never mind he already took the liqour out your Heineken
He already quick to try again
To steal the gifts another way
And give you all a different style again
Why you stackin' and you trying to swell
You best believe Mr. Grinch schemin, dude stay coneiving ass
Ay yo he stay schemin' when you thinkin' he not
Looking over your shoulder
Peepin' everything you got
(He, he, he Busta Rhymes I will get you too)
Relax duke you need to chill
Something seriously wrong with you

You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch
You really are a heel
You're as cuddly as a cactus
You're as charming as an eel
Mister Grinch, Mister Grinch
You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch
You really are a heel
You're as cuddly as a cactus
You're as charming as an eel

Killin’ ’Em,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Attention please, cause it's whoopass season!

You killin em baby, you know that baby

It's getting warm in here; lemme roll my sleeves up
You Fettuccine Alfredo niggas is gas
I respect your outfit, but I’m afraid your ass is trash
Funny but I always seem to have the last laugh
And bag a bitch with the potato bag ass
Yesterday I was quiet and made the ass glad
Today I dropped another heater and it made the ass mad
Fuckers, we have got it in a bag and in the stash
Then do the shit that make the bitches act bad
See this moment is addictive motherfucker
How I kill shit, they say, ""he a vindictive motherfucker""
I see the way niggas be hating when I get in the spot
They bitches be hallucinating when I spit
Ain’t no replacement for me when I quit so sick
Got them saying I’m amazing when I shit
When they come and see the movie and they sit
They would come to witness it, I was the greatest in the flick
This movie has been brought to you by The Conglomerate
Uncle L, talk to 'em!


Ladies love me, I’m on my Breezy
Uncle L, future of the funk
Without my stamp on it, how this joint gonna bump?
Let them taste the vintage, they want a free lunch
I guess they don’t know we playing ourselves, trump
Our nose in the air looking all stopped up
This is the anti-hista-green for the broke pop slut
You wanna impress me? Start manning up
Say something that sound like you piss standing up
You're lucky I made it out, the hood’s bad enough
Get you for your Gucci, leave your face tatted up
Flash back the skunk, el producto blunt
More green behind me, the fake gold fronts
I ain’t drop a verse in like 36 months
All I see BS, y'all need to quick stunt
Damn, right, it's like you Midas when you touch
Your career's like a hymen: once it's gone, you're fucked


Now you know it’s impossible to stop me now, right?
You see I’m back to yoke up the game in a chokehold
Put you to shame like the barrel was engraved in your nose hole
You gonna bounce to the next groove: I'm back bitch
Better get to rethinking your best move
Money to get, beating the pavement, gotta go
Where passports and visas and bitches waiting in Monaco
As I return to handle my biz
You know exactly what it is",https://genius.com/Busta-rhymes-killin-em-lyrics

Together,It Ain’t Safe No More...,2002.0,"Hey yo Swizz..
This shit sound like some shit
The streets wanna do the merengue to (yeah)
Or dance around a sombrero too, WHOO!!!
Yeah, another special from Flipmode Records
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah here we go!
Streets! Flipmode baby, yeah check it Busta Bus baby
Yeah, Rah Digga now, c'mon
Check it, huh

If you ain't noticed yet I have come wit a throne
See I was gone for a minute but now I'm home
The way I touch it you can feel it in your bones
Fuck wit the kid cause I'm taking you into another zone
See it don't matter what you think or what you say
I always love for the street every single day
You better get down on your knees, you better pray
Cause goin' against the grain of this Squad
I promise you will pay! (WHOO!)
You see Flipmode is the team that I rep forever
Respecting the Code of Honor staying together
It's getting hot I think you should take off the sweater
Rattle and knock all of your troops who goin to get this cheddar
See when we come I'm wondering how they gon' manage
Show em mysteriously watch how they vanish
See when we finish just analyze all the damage
No matter who you are, we accept any and EVERY challenge (yeah)
Yeah yeah, I think we got 'em again this time
Flipmode c'mon!
 {*Busta Rhymes ad-libs*}
I think I - I think wanna say something like this (like this)
People denying that they feeling our shit
So we hit 'em with the really crazy flow (crazy flow)
To let 'em know that we be hitting it fa' sho
Time goes by, in your life
And we're still here together

I hope you know that this is really not a game
The way I put it down you will remember the name
The way we change it up shit is never the same
And when I'm finished I promise I'll have you niggas feel ashamed
For giving the people shit they ain't really loving
It's funny to me but y'all niggas be buggin'
But it's aight because I will continue flooding the streets
With heat for the ladies and niggas who be thugging
And if you want it then bring shit wit open arms (spread love baby)
While I continuously give you niggas bombs
Assalam alaykom wa'alaykom salam
I'm in the abscence of confusion holding the world in my palms
I'm tired of telling you there ain't nothing greater
Swinging the torch and repping for Violator
So tell the DJ to go and turn up the fader
Putting it down for the streets regardless what you saying playa!
How many times am I gunna have to tell y'all?
Flipmode run these streets, c'mon!
 {*Busta Rhymes ad-libs*}
I wish I - I wish I had just a little more time (more time)
Instead I give you this and leave more on your mind (on your mind)
Me and Busta Bus be making crazy doe (crazy doe)
So you know that we be killing it fa' sho
Time goes by, in your life
And we're still here together
I will be here just to hold you down
We'll still be around
Cause we will rock forever

Dirty reppin' the Squad, don't even get me started
Getting worldwide love keeping the street regardless
Ever since kindergarten, always been the sharpest
Doin' this for my fam cause home is where the heart is
Other crews could chill, all of y'all days are numbered
Bus got the Yellow Digga coming in the Navy Hummer
Start quality, guess I should thank my mother
""Bionic Woman"" on the mic like I was Jamie Sommers
Now, I know that you don't wanna really take it there
Digga and Bus you know we make the perfect pair
We keep it gully wit a little latin flare, it's unfair
Oh well, how I still be spitting and keep everybody all up in the mix
It's only right that I shout my brother Swizz
Flipmode and we only making hits
It's like this, c'mon

 Baby I say, what people say
We gon' keep it on lock from day to day
Let 'em know that we both are here to stay
So keep it hot baby, don't stop baby
The Flipmode is in the spot we run the place
Busta Bus and Rah Digga all in your face
When we step up in the spot we controlling the space
We keep it hot baby, we won't stop baby

See we got a whole...
We got a gift-wrapped package for you motherfuckers
Yeah, yo, yo, yo, yeah
Bust it

I stay rippin' a nigga tracks so
Hotter than wax, yo, so tell me why you act so
Yo, I max 'cause I make a nigga black 'til its time to relax yo
Until you all collapse so, fuck it
It's hardly that the god is getting tired
You don't wanna say that
Can catch a cardiac relapse, nigga
What, the god is back so you don't want nuthin'
No matter how you react
Blows that black and blue your front and your back
Choose, whatever the route that you choose
Wounds so horrendous forensics will get to analyzing the bruise
Blows will never come in singular, they coming in twos
My crew be starting the ruckus once I give them the cues
To blast from the triggers that'll bust from all of my dudes
Be the shit that make you niggas run up out of your shoes
We make you back down, having the facts down
With all the noise you be making you can even see the shit on the news
Word up

So you don't know nuthin' about it
(
Barking

Yo, the heat from of the street will burn you up some
Yo, the shit I'm sure to spit will hurt you up some

But you don't know nuthin' about it

Yo, I drink a fifth of yack and hurl it up some
Yo, just bang it in the truck and turn it up some

Now watch me get a nigga fast, like them bitches with no ass
You corny niggas low class
Yo, I flash on them then I go and smash
Couple hoes and then splash on them
Flicking a little ash on them
From the blunt we smoking, keep a chick choking
Got them open with flows
I suppose it make them soak in their clothes
Keep the shit that make 'em sniff and make em open they nose
Got them fucked up, stuck just like they striking a pose
Yo, we gaining weight, nah, it's just my pockets are swole
From keeping niggas whylin' while they driving smacking the pole
Ah, one, two, yeah, see, perhaps, while I hold me a stack
Hater niggas block, holding me back
Yo, you fool niggas plotting against the god best be holding a strap
'Cause how we coming through, you know it's a wrap
Move with a crew of guerrilla dudes who know when to clap
I blow some shit from off of the Earth or the face of the map
Yo, so take that
Once we give it to you, ain't no faking a jack
It's funny how you find your face in a trap
Little bitch nigga fronting like he ready to scrap
You better off acting pussy trying to give me a dap
Staying focused on fulfilling a dream
The way we spark up and spit a fire, the flame probably killing your team
Fuck it, so now we harbor helicopters, turn this shit up
If you and your peoples ain't hearing me proper
I'm sayin...

So you don't know nuthin' about it

How We Do it Over Here,The Big Bang,2006.0," Bus-a-Bus baby-baby! Nooowww...

Pop yo' collars like this
Bottles up like this
Side to side like this
Holla if ya like this

See the ass? Touch me right there
Wanna touch my nookie baby? Touch me right there
Make me lose my mind baby? Touch me right there
Party over here, ain't shit over there!

See how I'm drillin 'em baby?
It's Bus-a-Bus back bitch, I'm killin 'em crazy
We off the Relaxic, I'm spillin the gravy
Got every club packed thick, creating a frenzy
To be the latest greatest for all you niggas from gazing
Bugatti off white tan, interior pastry
See my swagger sharp like that, these niggas amaze me
As a matter a fact just salute me and praise me
Enough of that

We be up in the club, niggas sportin them minks
Tipsy in the club, nigga buyin 'em drinks
Walk around lookin like our shit don't stink
Ice by my neck so bright, watch 'em blink

Okay, now I got me a clear view
I like it when you get up and I'm lovin ya hairdo
The way you cross ya legs, ass spread in the chair you
The way ya clothes skimpy, so it's easy to tear through
Appreciate my presence, while I shine wit' a barrel
I came up wit' cut diamonds, obscure in a rare blue
Shorty ain't checkin for you, step to the way I do
Super senile, I ain't the one to compare to
Now she was sayin...

See the ass? Touch me right there
Wanna touch my nookie baby? Touch me right there
Is that Dr. Dre baby? Touch me right there
Party over here, ain't shit over there!

 What you sayin Missy!?

We got some shit for that ass (come on, give it to me)
We got some shit for that ass (come on, give it to me)
We got some shit for that ass (come on, give it to me)
We got some shit for that ass girl

Bounce back, brand new on the scene what?
Took a little minute, I'm back with the re-up
Switched it up a little bit, back with a clean cut
Shorty's lost her head, see all the koochies I cream up
I love the way she in all over the girls when I'm teaming up
It's gettin hotter in this bitch, windows are steaming up
Amazed by the pinky, neck, and wrist be gleaming up
How I dominate the scene, how a nigga be cleaning up
I see you liking everything, you see me and you
You frowning on your girl, like you ain't willing to share boo
The hotel ain't far, meet me there and if you
Ya girl looking like she wit' it, she can come/cum get it too
You get impatient Ma, show you just how the kid move
I'm bangin in the truck, and let her watch in the rearview
See we don't really care about the niggas who came through
Over there cause over here, see I'mma show ya how we do
So check it baby...


See it don't matter what ya doin over there
See we gets it poppin, that's how we do it over here
That's if we toss bottles, that's how we do it over here
Check it, floss models, that's how we do it over here
Listen, rare throttles, that's how we do it over here
Check it, ice collars, that's how we do it over here nigga
See it don't matter what ya doin over there

Fall Back,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Nigga
You know it's a pimpin affair when the car enters
While you give your hoes mostly ice like bartenders
We shop heavy; a bunch of hard spenders
I'm a giant
In rap it's difficult for small forwards to guard centers
Don't let me hit you with the cali bro
I'm raining with the record of a street legend
And you ain't up my alimo
My nigga buggin' off that tan grass and hash
It'll cut a nigga's shit quicker than Grand Master Flash
Your shit ain't gonna never pop like 10 gold chains
That's why your bitch blowin' on me like Nintendo games
I ain't surprised most these hoes been the same since school
Doing more bending over than a game of pool
Get your own bread
Don't sweat it I got some
Now guns are like tattoo's nigga
Even Bow Wow's got one
You fuckin' with a champion
If I can't do it, it can't be done
Why you think we're number 1?

A lot of this niggas be runnin' with their crew frontin'
Perfectly honest
You niggas ain't gonna do nothin'
Chill yall...
And my nigga you can hold that
If you don't want to feel the ratchet
Nigga fall back

Right now, they're trying to hit me with a mob of feds...
They say I got that coke responsible
For that shit Whitney and Bobby said
Plus I got a chick with me that can slob a head
With a looser neck
Than the dolls with the bobble heads
She do her job in bed...
And slide down polls
Quick enough to change in the Batman and Robin's threads
The word has probably spread
If you hustle and don't want to end up in a lobby dead
Go and get a job instead
Cause if I slid through your area...
It'll probably be with them crazy little kids from Liberia
Who don't think of bids when they airin' ya?
Cause they so hungry, for a peeking of a fridge they will bury ya
You think you hot cause your chain hangs from neck to navel
When you're just another writer for your record label
Look how empty your pockets are
I can tell you never had 100 Grand
Unless it was a chocolate bar
I keep a full clip of shells that explode
Cause the canaries on my wrist look like the yellow brick road
And now they're bringing me models from Europe
And jars of hydro just as sticky as a bottle of syrup
I'm on the move like I ride a van
And I can walk through any gang territory
With the same suit as Spiderman
I'm a winner with my first two
And I'm stunting until my death
So I want spinners on my Hurse too

A lot of this niggas be runnin' with their crew frontin'
Perfectly honest
You niggas ain't gonna do nothin'
Chill yall...
And my nigga you can hold that
If you don't want to feel the ratchet
Nigga fall back

See now we own buildings
Totin' the Eiffel Towers
And if you violate
I'll put a hole in your cauliflower
Stacks of Serena Williams paper
Pushing a mean coup
I'll vegetable you niggas
Like a broccoli bean soup
Von Dutch flossin ass niggas, believe me dude
We jiggalo's dummy
With Emillio, that's the fast money
Look and see the zone that we in
Sipping yak from the 1800's
Specially brewed from the barrels of Napoleon
You never knew the daughter split niggas this bad
Left on colostomy diets and wrapped up in a shit bag
Rock white fitted's
White T's, 2-X
Coppin whips from overseas
Can't even drive the shit up in the U.S
Look cause we ain't hit you
Nigga thinking he blessed
Thanking the Lord like he was lucky
I'm sorry little nigga, you next
It's like robbing a nigga bitch
You better run in for before
I put this faggot to sleep
Countin' sheep by the hundreds
But now, you and your little friend dead
You nigga's think something's sweet
I'll sour your shit
Like a box of little Lemon Heads
About 80 niggas faces will leave you stitches
And have you looking worse
Than baby's born from retarded bitches
Then I take the whole shit
Even your small chain
And have the streets talking about me
Like sports announcers for ball games
A lot of niggas wonder why my shit stay stickin'
Cause I be talking greasy
Like I was just eating Church's Chicken

A lot of this niggas be runnin' with their crew frontin'
Perfectly honest
You niggas ain't gonna do nothin'
Chill yall...
And my nigga you can hold that
If you don't want to feel the ratchet
Nigga fall back",https://genius.com/Busta-rhymes-fall-back-lyrics
In the Streets,The Return of the Dragon: The Abstract Went On Vacation,2015.0,"You can't join 'em? Beat 'em
Villain teach you where to score some old concrete crumbs
Word is Gold Bond feets powder, corned thumbs
‘specially in the summer bless the drummer, warned ‘em
Tight your cleats, or else its right to the white meat
Some I bite to eat, others write the light bright heat
Despite threat regardless of the aspect, the shack, the burning holes through his black neck, fact check
No flicks, and he scam, thought alot with the quicks
Like the mini camcorder box, it’s a brick lick, Classic
As we stalk the great outdoors
Only use the magic nowadays to talk them out they drawers, but um
Before he go there let me take it where it started from
Smart kid sold some snake spit to a 'tarded bum
Not without carding em’, Mr. Guardin'-em
Find me in the mid-90s Midnight Mauraden-em
Hard, they wanted no part of him
More rhymes and ways to get paid, and there’s a lot of them
Great minds see alike take a sneak peek
Peek one foot out and still leave deep
No frontin' if you ain’t go huntin' or southern, you definitely ain’t gon ‘run em

In the streets is where you witness the worship happen in public
Where babies grow and turn into killers and and how they become it
They evolve as a result of not having food in the cupboard
Knowing that the shit they be doing is foul and grow to love it
Where the shit is never staged, every presentation is live
Some'll bang and turn crip and probably start whipping a five
But every now and then you find the mind of a child that has triumphed
Unique characteristics and deals with a higher science
Aspiring to take over the world and really does it
All one-hundred ninety-six million nine-hundred forty thousand square miles of it
Damn it's strange how shit change
But when you look again, ironically some shit is still the same
But in these streets you'll probably find a nigga regularly dreaming
Paying attention to everything, regularly scheming
Trying to calculate the next hustle without attracting heat
There be so many different things that be going down
Where bodies get clapped floating in oceans
It's where the suffering can callous your emotion
But parents pray for their children, constantly hoping that their babies don’t end up killed (in jail) or smoking
It's where you learn to make things out of nothing
Where people smoke crack instead of taking a Buffrin
Despite the Santa, the ratchet bussin' is common
With what we lived, to most other people it's foreign

The Streets
To be from the streets it’s a blessing, it’s a blessing
It teach the most unforgettable lessons, yeah lessons
So a nigga from the streets, don’t test him, don’t test him
Where most niggas probably get killed
Even babies busy fighting over breast milk
The streets'll help you get your soul right
Hope them wolves don’t get ya standing in the street light
And if them wolves catch you night night
When your boxers in the dirt and eating Popeye’s
And don’t forget my hot sauce
Get your mind watching loot and get your life lost

It’s like a jungle 24/7 365.44
I score gorilla war tour, yeah sure sure
When push comes to shove
This world done beef
But it’s still done love

On more than likely a level of hate that you can’t imagine
Where desperate acts occur cause of hunger beyond famine
Where instead of friends your ratchet becomes your closest companion
And when its beef your leave bodies with holes the size on canyons

On her strength she wasn’t lent 3 cent
Got her own connect for free rent off the cement
Now what if that was your moms?
Short arm, quart of water to bottles of Don
Bought the farm

Yo the streets consist abundantly of happiness and sorrow
It’s also where you lurk to secure your food for tomorrow
Where we take the shit ‘cause we ain’t paying it back if we borrow
Become the one that shine so the rest of the hood can follow

The Streets
To be from the streets it’s a blessing, it’s a blessing
It teach the most unforgettable lessons, yeah lessons
So a nigga from the street, don’t test him, don’t test him
Where most niggas probably get killed
Even babies busy fighting over breast milk
The streets'll help you get your soul right
Hope them wolves don't get ya standing in the street light
And if them wolves catch you night night
When your boxers in the dirt and eating Popeye’s
And don’t forget my hot sauce
Get your mind watching loot and get your life lost",https://genius.com/Busta-rhymes-in-the-streets-lyrics
If You Don’t Know Now You Know,Back on My B.S.,2009,"We're live in five, four, three, two, one!
Welcome everybody, you are ""live in the den""
With big tigger hangin' out today with one of my friends
Whattup, okay if you ain't know it be one of the best of all time
Busta bust for short, for some better know me bust' rhymes
(what's good?) maintainin' (same here, just smashin')
(how the fam?) they all good my nigga, thanks for askin'
You and yours?
We all blessed, things ain't too bad
Still dealin' with last year's sudden loss of my dad
(man, my condolences) thanks dawg, let's begin
Ain't seen you in a sec, busta what you been up to since then?
Stayin' healthy and keepin' it movin' while I just be showin'
These other niggas how to do it while I'm constantly growin'
I've been learnin' a lot, and still earnin' a lot of money crazy
Doin' my thing and securin' a win for all my babies
Aight, well it's clear in this new year you've been busy
But how you been dealin' with the drama of the loss of your man izzy?
It's been one of the most traumatic times and I'll never forget it
I'm survivin', thus bein' a punchin' bag for those affected
It's somethin' that I accepted, it was hard to understand
The way things happen, but in the end I guess it's god's plan
Word, heard you beefin' with five-oh, couple cases on rotation
And on top of that, bust' rhymes is now on probation?
Yeah, and I thank judge stevens and we was happy to see
That he ain't send me up north cause I got a family to feed
Changed your image up last year, cut the dreads down low
And also, gave the appearance of some major muscles
Now on the low streets been talkin' like it usually do
Busta bust, help us out, the public needs to know
Just for the record the reason a nigga cut off the dread
I had to shed, tired of carryin' weight on my head
Secondly, it's all good when niggas talk, well they need to back it up
Only needles I use is when I tat-tat-tat it up
Uhh, some people sayin' you changed, even your flipmode fam (uh-huh)
I heard the word's came safe from rah digga and baby sham (right)
Said you (passed the courvoisier) to pick up a gun
Said you more concerned about bein' hard than havin' fun
Yo, wow tig', I see you takin' it there; you got your arsenal, huh?
I think I know where you got that from, that vibe article bruh
The press'll turn your family against each other for 'fetti, to sell a book
Besides we all talked already and we good
Wowwww, that's what's up, be clear it's goin down
And if you wanna holla at bust call us up right now
Phone lines is open, what y'all, wanna discuss?
What's good caller, you ""live in the den"" with big tig' and bust
(hey tig'!) what's good ma? (enjoyin' the show)
(but there's somethin' about busta I've been dyin' to know)
Well holla at him
Hey busta (what's good ma?)
I've been a fan since way back when you dropped ""woo-hah""
(woo-hah!!) yeah, that was my joint
Every album since then always been on point
(thank you) videos and big shows is hardcore
So why you think your albums haven't sold more?
Well baby, the nature of the business is unstable
Especially when your project ain't properly promoted by your label
E'ry album I put out gold or platinum, just a second
Check the hardware on my walls is major, just for the record
Read about you in a book or two
Now tell me bust, please discuss, were they all lies or some of it true?
Well I read about you in a couple of books too son
But I don't even know, tell me which book you readin' from
Aight, next caller
Hey busta, heard about you on miss jones
(why you bringin' up old shit? you need to leave that alone)
So I'm sayin', is it true what she said?
Did you jump right out from between her legs and start fryin' eggs?
I can't remember exactly but I used to ride to her hood
And pick her up all hours a night, thought the pussy was good
'bout fifteen years ago, shit
I can't imagine she'd remember that a nigga made a mean egg sandwich
I seen a couple websites try to put you on blast (uh-huh)
With your relationship with homegirl with the real fat ass
Who? you talkin' 'bout deelishis? yeah her body is vicious
She like trouble; thus we only friends, y'all made us a couple
How do you deal with the gossip, rumors and lies
And feelin' like each and every move you make is analyzed?
Yo, it's all good, you see the blessing is a gift and a curse
To be in a position I am, shit could be worse
I know my time's runnin' short so let me get to this thought
I'm sure you wanna thank your fans for all of their support
Absolutely, see y'all are why I shine like the sun
Big up to all my peeps who been ridin' with me since day one
It's why I walk the streets with pride, you niggas know how I shit it
It's why I rep it thorough for all the fans who stay committed
Busta, now you've been gettin' it in since way back when
So what you say to critics sayin' you can't do it again?
See I ain't gotta say shit to 'em, I'm off to somethin' else
Nigga check my rã©sumã©, bitch it speak for itself
It's why I always do what I do, and I big up my chest
God put his hands on me, you could see that I'm blessed
And I'm grateful
Aight! it's time to go
But I thank y'all for tunin' on in to the ""live in the den"" show
And if you don't know, now you know
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga
Holla busta 
(yes, yes, yes) 
(yes, yes, yes) 
That's what's up man, holla (ha ha ha, you crazy nigga)",https://genius.com/Busta-rhymes-if-you-dont-know-now-you-know-lyrics

While you learn on how the words go to my motherfuckin' song Watch me puts it on
It keeps you open all day long
(The way we fuck shit up you thinkin' something must be wrong)
Set the high standards for corny niggas to get the gong
Bleach your ass blonde and black your color back to bronze
On happy days, I be the coolest nigga like The Fonz
So spectacular how I touch souls from here to Africa
My Zimbabwe niggas bangin' my joints up in they Acura
Ooh, nigga, you feel the bump from bumper to bumper
Drivin' imported five hundreds in foreign license plate numbers
Ha-ha, laugh at ya, oh, me and my passengers
Flip ass niggas over quick like frying pan spatulas

When disaster strikes, you will all see
When disaster strikes, you will all bear witness

Yo, I keeps flows so ridiculous
Rhyme flow taste good like a handful of cherry licorice
Practice your rhyme or be the local practitionist
Well, you can try being a doctor or being a local obstetricianist
See, you can be somethin'
Quit tryin to work so fuckin' hard towards nothin
This rhyme shit was never de signed for every swollen muffin
Yo, I'm singin'...
Why y'all niggas think that y'all could really see my Squad?
And if we hit you hard, that's when you feel the power of the God
Do it right, and big up my peeps and A-Alikes
On alike, repel, especially feel when disaster strikes
Extremely delicate like the blowing out of candlelights
The quiet killing surprises niggas whenever they wanna fight
That type of shit that shine, and blind a nigga eyesight, a'ight?
We keepin' it tight, y'all niggas don't want it right?
You will never ever get no wins inside mi casa
We killin' all impostors like we killin' cucarachas
Bounce to award ceremonies like we winnin' Oscars

Let me loosen up your bra-strap mama nigga
LISTEN UP! Look how we be rippin up and got the party pickin up
And got you niggas spittin up SHIT
No pain, nigga never no gain, nigga no strain
O.D. into my cocaine music
Spit that venom; pretty thick bitches walk by
If you let 'em pussy printin through they denim
Take her for a ride 'round the block, let her enjoy the whip
Drop her off, let her walk the strip
Ain't it funny how nature work?
Make bitches wanna bounce on a nigga 'til they make it hurt, c'mon

Shake yo' shit until you make it hurt

Pop that shit until you make it hurt
Bounce 'til you really wanna make it hurt

Get on your mark, get ready set go bitches
Then we go and add a little propane to it
Then we send another whole flame through it
Clear everything in my path, before I split you in half
You wack nigga, better get you a staff
The freak bitches try to hit me with math
Brushin off wack niggas while them same bitches givin me ass, yo
Now let me give you more hot shit, just for the record

Thirty karat diamond pinky ring look like a marble
I don't mean to startle, making bitches argue
Put it in your mouth, stop the yapping, and gargle
Take over the whole shit, never do it partial
Fucking up the building till they call a fire marshal
Drop another classic, add a chapter to the novel
Pop a couple bottles, fuck a couple models
Rev it to the point where niggas bust open the throttle
You think you got a pot of gold? Got a couple potfuls
Could give a fuck about your shine, bitch I got a watch full

Them boys hot bitch, aw man
Make sure the penthouse suite got a ceiling fan
See, when I win, it's like it's God's plan
And when they see it, got these niggas saying ""God damn!""

Keep it movin', keep it movin' (Look at the jam of the mic)
Keep it movin' along, keep it movin' along (It's the L-the O-the N-the S)

What three initials blows it up like me?
Besides TNT, CNN and BET
My visionary which is skippin on my D-O-G
I guess it was a S-O-S from G-O-D
Chaos has arisen interteller space souls (SOULS!)
Cellular, good ridance, like keypads wit ol' bass
Third planet states while the rest of the world waits (WAITS!)
Joy to the world, meaning hail, snow and earthquakes
Participates, modulates
If comets were round plates, bitten names gates
For only those involved relates, case after case (CASE!)
Dinco's on the next space
Movin strategically in the Solar System's waste (RAHHH!)
Size 25, the lymph still be in place (HAHHH!)
Stretch and extending, for flexin is impending
It's not mind-bending or refrain to keep remembering (HMMM!)
Cuz everybody's people gonna doubt, or believe (WOO!)
We dispense necessity, to shout and receive

Keep it movin' along

People in the party, are you really feelin?
We ain't seein eye-to-eye so you ain't really seein (SEE!)
I be hippin all type of niggas, sayin fuck that nigga Blow
When they see me in the party, they better act like they know
YO, we connectin dots that makes spots hot
Uhh, to the beat'cha (Y'ALL!), ah ya don't stop (STOP!)
Notice, how many groups can formulate then lose focus
With a lot of hocus pocus, concepts that sound bogus
I'm seein the world and all its different kind of poses (WOO!)
Crush you like roaches, that's keepin the crowd movin (HAA!)
Mr and the dancers, who said ""Culture consumin?""
Never face, he ????? ????? and strength
Cos I contiminate, like a dirty hypodermic needle
My vision's clearer than the sights on an eagle
Stop them bustin high, bring the head back to my table
Don't front, circle circle, dot dot, you catch your speed, not
Feel that, cos this type of vibe sounds done
(Far from the...., to the doe-run-run-run to the doe-run-run)
(YES!) Yes to the beat-boys and your ass accepted
Exclusive, L-O-N-S bringin the ruckus, wild aggressive

Keep it movin', keep it movin', keep it movin'
Keep it movin' along, keep it movin' along

Now don't get me wrong, CHILL!!!
Let me out, no question, no doubt
????? god is a drought
I've come to wet the party like a tropical depression
????? mixed with scherm for this musical session
(STOP!) stressin, testin, second-guessin, who's 'fessin?
Life is a lesson in disguise like a blessin
Click in , kickin, better back up chicken
Stickin' stunts, cause I keep it real, front Brown! (BROWN!)
Cos I'm like a ???? hands therapeutic
Measurements, square, feet, and cubic
We're all makin pennies off a record, so who needs the paper? (WHO?)
The man in Manhatten lampin in the skyscrapers
How much can a nigga take before he break fool?
I tell ya cool, with the New School
And the tool to examine my unorthodox pattern
From Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn
And don't forget Uranus, Neptune and Pluto
Flow deeper than the lava inside a volcano, bro
(Never snitch, never dominate
I'll be wild, smokin drowsy)
Fuckin up my economics, is it rather ironic
Sippin gin, juice and tonic
Like Shawn Kemp with some hemp, super sound and sonic
Baby, above your head, below your feet and it still wimp
C-Boogie Brown, my shit is brilliant

Yah yah, yah (AHH!)
My shit be so gigantic
And I'mma take 4 steps and cross the whole Titanic
Better believe I (KEEP!) movin (OVER!) people's heads
You know my crew for bringin' it full-fledged
Bringin it back like a fresh out the box, pair of Pro-Keds 69ers
(LEADERS OF THE NEW!) I'm the house so open up your blinders
Yo, I be the Moses takin poses
With a rhyme flow so beautiful like a large bouquet of roses
(Keep it movin' along, keep it movin' along
Keep it movin' (get busy, baby), keep it movin')
Keep it movin' now
No need to try to stop it, we gon' wreck shit anyhow
Yo, limitations is somethin I never will allow
When we bake the cake, I be that nigga that brings the icing
Disregard your whole identity and revoke your driver's licence
You know I blast in your ass real fast
Got your bladder burning, desperate for a bathroom pass
Monumental, like a Busta Rhymes statue made of brass (c'mon) Hypnotise the mass
Shit so hot, better jump in the water, nigga (SPLASH!)
Breakin through the party like a fuckin' Sound clash
Split the Philly down the back and mix the weed with more hash
I will wash away your pain like Draino
Erupting like the angriest volcano, or the wickedest whirlwind and tornado
We stay up in the streets, cruisin, me and my whole crew, gotta.......

Keep it movin' along
Keep it movin', keep it movin', keep it movin'
Keep it movin' along, keep it movin' along
Keep it movin', keep it movin', keep it movin', keep it movin'
Keep it movin' along, keep it movin' along
Keep it movin', keep it movin', keep it movin', keep it movin'
Keep it movin' along, keep it movin' along
Keep it movin'

And you knowin that I'mma always keep it hot 'til the end
And again and again, that's how we

Go round, round, ah-ah-ah-ah-ahh-ahh
Go round, round, ah-ah-ah-ah-ahh-ahh

Ay, AY! Just feel my presence
Better than ever, back with a vengeance
Ah hey, slide on baby just ride on
I give ya, e'rything people rely on
My nigga, the heat that meat gets fried on
Still'll, drop shit to murder the club
Call it a killa, stand up with my back on the wall
And let her throw her ass, that's what a thug do
Put it down, rep how we rep, niggas know we ball
If you ain't know we bought out the club too
Baby girl get it - let's swing it
Right back to the crib then I hit it, she love the way I spit it
Huh! See when I come they love how I'm movin it
They worship the kid and the way I'm really doin it
Shit, make baby girl moist
I'm steppin in the club, valet the Rolls Royce

Filthy talkin, bottle poppin
Disco rockin, park, go party
I feel life, money and Cashmere
These things, make the world go round
Round, ah-ah-ah-ah-ahh-ahh
Go round, round, ah-ah-ah-ah-ahh-ahh
Go round, round, ah-ah-ah-ah-ahh-ahh
Go round, round, ah-ah-ah-ah go round

Now what the hell are you lookin for?
Watch how a nigga bring the ceilin to the floor
See the way I do and get a little raw now
Break somethin, see the way we kickin in the door now
When I come see a Range and a Porsche now
Do what I say, women to the floor now
More is what I'm comin to get
World tours now, nigga charter the jet
Got, women sweatin and they ready and they willin I
Come to the telly and they steady doin the diddy bop
Hit you with it, sh-sh-sh-sh-shorty gettin really hot
Pretty with it, the way a bitch can make the city stop
Whyle all night, mami know the routine
Style so right - and I'm creatin a new scene
Bass seem to make mami come and put it on ya
While I give it to ya cause you know I'm back to DO IT for ya!


And away we go - off to the next spot
First 5 is a little club kinda hot
First on the scene, see the blunt fire spark
Snatch shorty, take her to the corner where it's dark
Now, shorty breathin all heavy, hands all on me
Then she turn around and try to put her ass on me
I ain't payin no mind
'til I seen her crew waitin on the Soul Train line
Now, shorty workin hard tryin to get with me
Wanna take me to the bathroom tryin to give me quickie
But - I ain't trickin on 'em like my name Tricky
When they smell my cologne they wanna try to give me hickie
Like kissin and huggin and suckin on my wrist full of diamonds
Move slow, I'll tuck your little chick in my pocket
Type of shit I do all day

We get it hype even when we be calm
Niggas know my word is my bond
When we come you know we the bomb
Hypnotic shit, get you retarded
Shoulda known it was a bad move
Fuckin around and gettin' me started
Still whippin' in the back of the truck
So what, not givin' a fuck
In the streets, livin' it up
So what happened to the last nigga bust
Could give a fuck whoever he was
Throw them niggas outta the clubs
Them niggas all, shit turnin' me off
Tie 'em up, makin' 'em cough
Gag 'em in the throat with a cloff
After that we go and wild for the night
Make 'em know the style for the night
Car low, pile for the night
You know we always give y'all niggas a blaze
Black it out and party for days
Let y'all niggas fuck with the strays
Fuckin dimes at the end of the days
Gettin money but it's too late
Got a nigga stuck in his ways

All my dogs who hustle every day
All my dogs who hustle every day now
Own a store laundromat around the way
And own a store, laundromat around the way now
We got to get it, yeah
My niggas, all my niggas
Show me what you got for me, what you got for me
All my niggas what ya got for me
All my shorties who stay fresh every day
All my shorties that stay fresh every day
My get money bitches who still hang around the way
All my get money bitches that chill around the way now
We got to get it, yeah, we gotta
My bitches, all my bitches, c'mon

Sorry, but we don't give a fuck about your credentials
We back to reinstate the boom bap wit' the fundamentals
Then they act like they don't wanna move back
So when the gun's essential
Blat, hit a shot 'til they clap, so disrespectful
Calm down, the shit like this
What the fuck is wrong with your mental?
While I remind 'em who's the nicest
Sometimes these niggas' forgetful
I, so official, we makin' them actin' civil
These fickle niggas, we beat them until they're crippled
Fold their bitch-asses up and serve 'em just like a nickel crack
Then pin them down when I carve my initials in their back
Sing along with the whistle
While we constantly launching missiles
Want to debate who be nicest
Then niggas want to argue with you
What's the issue? Y'all already know the answer:
If I've been called I make them black up in this bitch
Then they kick a hole in the wall

Hit you with the iron like Mackle boy
Spit fire when I rhyme till I smack a toy
I build, destroy, I bring pain, I bring joy
Tactics employed like Pretty Boy Floyd
Or Al Capone, international zone
Coaster my toaster in this holster home
But if it comes to the art, and it makes a spark
You're gonna find out the bite's much worse than the bark
Similar to a shark when I light up the dark
Put your body in park when I'm hitting my mark

This Means War!!,E.L.E. (Extinction Level Event): The Final World Front,1998.0,"Just make sure them, them drums is smackin
This, means, WAR!!

I work hard to take care of every one of my niggas
Feel the love and appreciation from all of my niggas
When I think meditate and contemplate for my soul
Watch the truth manifest once the story unfold
Disloyal motherfuckers I'mma BANISH you all
And celebrate all in your absence once I get rid of y'all
Sometimes I can't describe the wicked shit I feel in my heart
Break my silence and sporadically tear you apart
Strike with a serious vengeance and before you die
Put you through the worst and make you take a look in my eye!
So you could witness the extreme damage caused by betrayal
Make you sorry for the fact that you attempted and failed!
Make you eternally suffer, you was one of my mens
Turn your back on me, and I'mma make sure you get it back times ten
Stay TRUE -- now that's the one thing I religiously pledge
If you ain't wit me I'mma throw you WAY over the edge
THIS MEANS WAR!!

Take a look inside
You can run and you can hide
If you cross my path
I'll make sure you feel my wrath
Give and you receive
Cherish every breath you breathe
Scriptures on the wall
Those who betray all must fall

As I cherish every blessing and I greet you with hugs
You my peoples when I see you I embrace you with love
Yeah I be the one to come and get you out of the hole
Yeah you be the one to run and leave me out in the cold
So amazing how many times you plot and you scheme
But what you don't realize, you'll never conquer my dream
Though devilish karma can't penetrate the steel in my armor
Time passed, my oppression got you living with drama!
Paranoid of my retaliation, living in fear
Disloyalty will have me kill my brother, sheddin a tear
Such a shame how you could easily get trapped in a zone
And have to go to war with FAKE niggas standin alone
Until I get with all my loyal niggas goin the length
Don't matter how hard you try you never weaken my strength!
Now I'm with all of my loyal niggas, breakin the bread
And if you diss the code of honor we takin your head;
THIS MEANS WAR!!

Take a look inside
You can run and you can hide
If you cross my path
I'll make sure you feel my wrath
Give and you receive
Cherish every breath you breathe
Scriptures on the wall
Those who betray all must fall
Nobody helps them
Now he has his revenge

Whatchu gon' do? Whatchu gonna do?
Where you think you can run, or you can hide?
Where you think you can run, or you can hide?!!
Where you think you can run, or you can hide?!!!
Where you think you can run, or you can hide?!!!!
I'mma BE the best to show love let's co-operate
Disloyalty is somethin that we won't tolerate
Deal with these niggas, let's put them where they properly go
On the Island far away in a place where NOBODY know
So long fightin the bullshit for so many years
Watchin the danger and niggas double crossin they peers
Yes I always fight for what is right and put my foot down
Disrespect my love, I'mma be LAYIN YOU DOWN
THIS MEANS WAR!

Take a look inside
You can run and you can hide
If you cross my path
I'll make sure you feel my wrath

The Coming (Intro),The Coming,1996.0,"It was a dark night, pitch black, May 20, 19...
Approximately 11:30 p.m., a black child was born
Upon his arrival and rapid growth
Being exposed to the many casualties of the streets
He has now realized what must be done....
He must bring the ruckus to all you mothafuckas..
He must bring the ruckus to All you mothafuckas..
He must bring the ruckus to ALL you mothafuckas!

And now for the moment all you motha fucka's been waitin' for...
All my flipmode niggas rise and awake for
The most powerful event to occur..THE COMING!!
Once again you now rockin' wit the best
Flipmode is the squad for the year of 1996
UH! Rampage the Last Boy Scout is who I be
Here to take you on another ride of the
Flipmode explosion. Street to street, land to land
Coverin' all burial grounds in your area
I'm here to bring on my physical
The 8th wonder of the world
Straight from the dungeon shot
The infamous, the infamous, Busta Rhymes!
Boy Scout's who I be, Flipmode is still the squad...

Yo, hey yo, yo, this joint right here, is dedicated to all the
Mu'fucka's who fell off...and the mu'fucka's who's about to fall off!
Yo, keep falling, keep fallin', hey!
Keep falling, yo, keep fallin', keep fallin
This is specifically for the mothafuckas who came out here
Claimin' to represent hip-hop but really didn't do shit
To preserve the value of the fuckin' artform
The way of life. Hip-hop is a way to live man;
It ain't no institutionalized religion or somethin'
It's a way to live, it's a culture, dog, you know what I mean?
You know, so if you ain't really got nuthin beneficial
To offer this hip-hop shit, preserve the value of the artform
The music, the way of living, don't even fuck wit it!
We don't need deadweight mothafuckas
This is where we at as it stands right now
In the current day of 1996, mothafuckas
There's only four years left.
 This is dedicated to
All the niggas who keep falling, keep fallin', so keep fallin'!
AAAAAAHHHHHH!!! Ha, so keep fallin'..........thanks a lot",https://genius.com/Busta-rhymes-the-coming-intro-lyrics

Lord Have Mercy, Busta Rhymes, Flipmode Trilogy

Ayo, we ain't familiar at all, nigga
Don't like it? Go grab your gat and lets brawl it et al., nigga
Straight foolin', when we use to chill up on park benches
My twenty block radius think we need some barb wire fences
Stop bitch niggas like you from easily trespassing
Nickel nine, shine on your eye, then you see fire blastin'
Get off my premises! Ayo, Lord, is you a friend of his?
'bout to pack the jawn and show this nigga just who the winner is
The presence of a small-time, I diminish and blemish his
I'ma play ya ass out like a game on my little Sega Genesis
This is inappropriate, fuck is we talkin' for and we ain't even associates?
Ass lyrical beatings, straight trick or treating
Ay, what ya eatin'? I ain't got no words for you
Fuck speakin'! Ain't part of my crew, face look too brand new Who?
Niggas ain't even allowed to send my patch through
Can't chill on my corner, can't go up in my bodega
Chill before I call Dinco to grab the quatro-cinco
We don't give a fuck right now
We be the high-caliber shit, y'all corny niggas must bow
We do unforgivable shit, we blow the spot anyhow
Move
Ready for battle, 'cause I'm refusin' to lose
I'ma beat ya ass in front of nobody with nothin' to prove
Live nigga shit right there
Beware, stand clear
None of y'all niggas is welcome here

Fuck is these niggas, son?
Get off my block
Yo, I don't know none of these niggas, duke
Get off my block
Them niggas wanna sell they weed here
Get off my block
Yo, who these unfamiliar cornballs?
Get off my block
Let’s run these niggas off my street corner
Get off my block

Now who the fuck you be? Landlord
Cradle a stainless for strangers
Vigilante, trigger stampedes
On the bulletproof hooded crews
The latest nigga that can't breathe
Move you; off the block
The unorthodox general
Flash flood when a crowd
Patrol  for the intrepid style
And wreck more kids than pedophiles
Nigga, uh, forever trapped in danger
They Macarena when I jack my razor
Sharp words that scar herds
Nigga, I'm from the wicked city
Where chickens twist trees and dick-tease
Breastfeed,  with asthmatic chest wheeze
Lord Have, cardiac arrest freeze
Please, bastard handicap crews that stay soft
It's mayor Adolf
School your army, your squad weak
Remove four camps when I say
Up in arms like Norplants
I conquer and hold
Home sweet home down with monster control
Still they in the cut like Ron and Nicole
And still we must bring the ruckus to all you motherfuckers
Automatically, assault and battery
We battle thieves that get tragically slapped to sleep to relax the beef
Collapse like weak cancerous lungs
Scatter, we numb
Non-feeling, nap with the jarred villain that alarm buildings
Calm scrimmage, woke up Allah's children
Dirty-ass Vietnam village
I'm finishin' out sons
Then pose, like Minister Malcolm at the venetian blinds
By all means necessary, I reach for mine and lift
Golden showers from roof tops
And give orders, rugged pound acre
Drown violators in buckets of piss water

Fuck is these niggas, son?
Get off my block
Yo I don't know none of these niggas, duke
Get off my block
Them niggas wanna sell they weed here
Get off my block
Yo, who these unfamiliar cornballs?
Get off my block
Let’s run these niggas off my street corner

Fuck is these niggas, son?

Get off my block
Them niggas wanna sell they weed here
Get off my block
Yo, who these unfamiliar cornballs?
Get off my block
Let’s run these niggas off my street corner

Layin' in them Tahoes we own the projo's
Three for tenement we in the lobby with the big
(da dun dun dun) Don't move cause I'm a representative
Live for the street, ask, you die in the war
'member that -- blast that three atcha -- hide in the wall
We gangsta, republicans with them big things, big rings
Get your head shot off, daddy you don't believe chains
Loose cameras, big hammers, Station Wagon, blue Phantoms
Smokin' the block up, y'all witness the zoo gamblers
We ain't takin' no shorts, its just the early 80's
That made me, now I sit paid and then maybe
Nothing but my Lords and raps, these bags of dope
Under the mattress and I clack like a slave key
Wash your squad up, I roll double refuse to rock
Closed up my door up and murked you on the job (aww)

Gettin' money like back in the days
Niggas like shower posse in a spectacular drug games
Slayin' niggas, steady sprayin niggas, till the task forces'll roll up
In unmarked vehicles and will be layin' niggas
Streched that coke and see it come back triple
When we O.T. cut it with baking soda or quinine
Strategize, gettin' paper like the Chinese, Jamaicans
And George Chain niggas, and watch me set up a Goldmine

We got guns tucked in our waistlines with rags hangin' from our back pockets
Miraculous money, nigga, can't stop it
Sherlock Holme' Kangols
Medallions so big, attach strings you could turn 'em into banjos
Phenomenal profiting, drug money
Scram rapper, my 100EX golden like a honey graham cracker
Sidewinda, niggas tryna' infiltrate, blind-side a nigga
Hit you with the 8, we in the club
Dumbin' out, drunk in fronta the airbrush
Backdrop, ones out, fi'-dollas for picture with the guns out
Juggle for a couple days, close shop
Then continue to bubble until the strip hotter than a microwave
Don't stop, travel on my spare time
And keep niggas wit us to push our shit like George Jefferson hairline
No frill, niggas better go chill
'Fore this gun go up in your nose like coke sniffin' up your nose-stril

Gettin' money like back in the days
Niggas like shower posse in a spectacular drug games

In unmarked vehicles and will be layin' niggas
Streched that coke and see it come back triple

Strategize, gettin' paper like the Chinese, Jamaicans
And George Chain niggas, and watch me set up a Goldmine

Ay yo, saluteme kid, coop me in the red room booth
And eatin' Fruit Loops it's all for the loot boo
Designated hammer that'll lay ya up scrambling
Blant ninjas get 'em more popped up, and start blowin' niggas magnums up
Caught me in the mix wit some rich soldiers, that reaction
Is a key action, black sent forty doja's up
We huddle in big plans, my big mans and them
Slick as the shit breaks from outtas you, rip dip, then quakes them

See I was always good at science, in the class I was dope
Ask 'em for the chemistry temperature now I'm cookin' the coke up
Used to sit and watch them older niggas for hours
And did acknowledge to how cold water quickly harden the powder
Took your turn into somethin big to acredit (uhh)
But ya needs connect shit up from South America
Money calculations, told B.I.G. I sit up on it still
Holdin old hundred dollar bills, wit small faces

Gettin' money like back in the days

In unmarked vehicles and will be layin' niggas

Jah and Busta, baby

Yeah, wife in law, my bitch for the triflin' whore
Type of bitch to make a nigga get the right things for
Bitch sexy, and beautiful, and gangsta, and golden
Love to fuck a nigga till the pussy dry and swollen
My lil' bitch had a figure like a wine glass
Slim bitch stackin like a muhfucker with a fine ass
Word to mother; bitch nasty like me
Love to fuck a nigga in places where people could see
The bitch send a chill like cold freezin a nigga
The way she holdin and bitin and suckin and squeezin a nigga
Down and dirty bitch never dick teasin a nigga
Got her own paper and focused on pleasin a nigga
She ain't out for gettin a nigga or fuckin my life
She only wanna fuck a nigga while he fuckin his wife
There was nuttin she couldn't achieve
In the mornin bitch was across the street waitin for wifey to leave
Called me on the cell while the wife was runnin a bath
She can't wait for me to fuck her, till I cum in her ass
Just a long-time chick I used to fuck from the past
She love to out-fuck a nigga, see how long I could last
It be nice the way she always let me dig in her rib
The bitch fuck a nigga like she wanna move in my crib
Bitch I always knew ya ass was a star
In the daytime, whippin the droptop, givin me head in my car

When a woman needs love, just like you do
Oh, don't kid yourself, into thinkin that you don't
Cuz she will fool around, just like you do
Ohh, don't kid yourself, into thinkin that she won't

C'mere bitch and place ya pussy right where it belong
And put me in the mood to fuck just like a Jodeci song
I love the little freaky shit you be approachin me on
Dick all in ya mouth, you know what type of shit I be on
The way the pussy lock feel like we about to be stuck
All outside busy, givin me the balcony fuck
Hold on get up off of me quick
Bitch grab the X.O. and suck the Hennessey up off of my dick
So quick, so fast, bitch'll come out her skirt
Fuck a nigga till it hurt, while the wifey at work
The bitch'll even call her girl so I can fuck with her friend
And fall asleep to wake up and start fuckin again
Straigh nasty little bitch no horsin around
The bitch even want me to fuck her when she walkin around
Hold up, it's kinda ill how we be workin the caper
She ain't only good for pussy, she be givin me paper
Wife-in-law, my bitch be always keepin it raw
Always slidin out before the wifey walk in the door
They way she fuck me on straight for the night
Wifey still ain't make it home, I wonder if she workin late for tonight
Wifey actin funny style but I ain't fuckin with that
She ain't call the crib so I wonder where wifey was at
Hmmm.. shit kinda had me buggin before
But now I laugh because wifey had a husband-in-law

Let me talk to you, baby
I've got some shit to share with your freaky ass, haha

I like the way you freaky, baby, I love your style
The way you stick your tongue in my mouth and act wild
The way you give me them little fights and little tussles
Bite the back of your neck, weaken your leg muscles
That type of chick who always want to take it there
She don't care, ready to fuck anywhere
Make a nigga want to bust 'til my legs cripple
Put your breasts in my face, tell me bite the nipples
You got me breathing hard, the whole shit
Kiss me on the chest, my belly button
Baby, start to kiss the whole dick
Strap you up one time
Slap your ass up two time
And watch it jiggle
I love the way your whole ass wiggle
The way she turning me on
And make my little freak wanna giggle
Before the dick paid the pussy a visit
Grabbed the pussy from the back a stuck my fingers all in it

Have you ever went over your freak's house to chill
And the both of y'all understood
That y'all could chill with the talking 'cause y'all were straight fucking
And for both of y'all, it's all good
Sometimes you try to play it off but you know you can't
Now a nigga dick hard like wood
You tried the macaroni-salad-the-sweet-pussy-delight
I'ma fuck it every time I could

My freak starts stripping
I take a closer look, her pussy dripping
Flipping, you know I ain't tripping
Got my heart skipping, anticipating the fun
Baby, kiss the dick one more time and start the dick suck
I like the way you lick it, the way you suck it
The way you tell me how you want the right dick to fuck it
The dick rest upon the pussy hair like wool
Grab my ass and pull, say you want your pussy hole full
Now talk the dirty shit, I like it like that
The way you swing your waist and throw all the pussy back
Baby got me all in the pussy, I ain't joking
She turning round, bending over, spreading her ass wide open
Oh yes, so I can get it all in
She say she like the way the dick make the pussy feel from deep within
And when it slip out, she stick it back in
I love her just the way she is and how she handle her biz

Have you ever went over your freak's house to chill
And the both of y'all understood
That y'all could chill with the talking 'cause y'all were straight fucking
And for both of y'all, it's all good
Sometimes you try to play it off but you know you can't

Just face the fact your shit's a wrap and you gotta deal with the shit
Despite I talk about it, I ain't makin' fun of them niggas
I give thanks cause I've been blessed and I ain't one of them niggas
Can't imagine how difficult it is, I know you suspect
That shit around you is lookin' dumb, it's gettin' hard to accept it
Alone in the mirror, you look at yourself and you smile
Disregarding the fact your running's been done for a while
Refuse to acknowledge the truth like the mind of a child
Continue frontin', like it's nothin while you live in denial
While all your people around you start to leave you in the same place
You overexert the little you have left to save face
You tryin' to hide your expression from lookin' worried
On what to do when your career is buried

Niggas ain't givin' a fuck about your flows no more
You ain't the star you were, fuckin' the same hoes no more
Promoters ain't payin' and bookin' you for shows no more
You ain't whippin' the Range, you ain't whippin' a Rolls no more
Reality starts to settle in, you're sweatin' every wake up
You're broke and now you gotta return your jewelry to Jacob
You run around and you front like you're still on fire
But nobody believes you; and now you live as a liar
You're only lyin to yourself cause it's evident in the proof
As your world continues to crumble, come to terms with the truth
You're still holdin on to them days when everything was about you
But niggas don't even remember you enough to just shout you
I remember when you did your thing without a doubt tastefully
The problem was you didn't know when to bow out gracefully
Once told, never burn out, it's best to fade away
Preserve your value so that you can live to see a greater day
People see you and it's bugged that you mean nothin'
You doin' shit and front to prove to people you mean somethin'
It happens in the vicious when the truth starts to settle in
You step to the door of the club and see that you ain't gettin' in
Forgettin' you a man first, chasin the fame
Got to remember, morals and principles, reppin' your name proper
But most niggas don't, and they whole life hurried
What do you do when your career is buried

Do you ever think (do you ever think)
What life would be (what life would be)
Where you will go (where you will go)
After you die (after you die)
Do you ever think (do you ever think)
What life would be (what life would be)
Where you will go (where you will go)
After you die (after you die)

Okay, I told you we was gonna get more acquainted at a time when you least expect it nigga
I'm here to lay you to rest once and for all 
You've been dead a long time but you refuse to accept that shit
But it's okay 
Nigga shut the fuck up and get in the box nigga (WAIT!! Please!)
It was custom built for all niggas like you 
You just don't wanna accept when it's time to hang it up
(Stop! Bitch) See you in the afterlife nigga (Wait! Stop!)
Whatever the fuck that is! (Somebody, Help)

Bounce back, my repercussion cause mass destruction
Fuck around strain ya, 'til ya plan malfunction
Sit cha ass down, (Hey!), bouncin' out ta Flushin (Queens, NYC)
Check extra P, by the boom weed, from a Russian
I remember, when I used ta rhyme, for next to nothin'
I got so much ta offer, every time I tell you somethin'
(Hey!) I'm about ta drop it! (Who?) you could never stop it
Let me quickly chop it, still, a lot of niggas -
Idolize the false prophet, the rhyming Lou Gossett
Hold your head and shoulders, yo I roll with evil holders

Fuckin' with them devils, watch your soul get recollected
Motherfuckin' shame when you (DIE!) disrespected
Every bitch nigga in the world, should be arrested
Beat with many strikes, until their train of thought is redirected

I be, testing your faith and wrecking your face, invading your space
And watch the tables turn like you're trading a place
I pull stunts like Evel Knievel, me and my people fly like an eagle
And blow your entire cathedral, hurry hurry, don't worry worry
Hit y'all with a flurry flurry of jabs, leaving y'all niggas blurry blurry
Brew up some shit like I'm cooking for y'all
When I'm done then I come looking for y'all
(Huh huh hold up hold up)
Federal cases cause nuff bodies end up in medical places
In they blood finding them chemical traces
Leaving special investigators going through skeptical phases
While we getting money the decimal changes
I was a Seventh Day Adventist apprentice
Now I strike with a vengeance
Blowing the door right up off of the hinges
This be that, ""Put Your Out Of Your Misery"" song
And make you ask your man is this the joint he dissing me on
That's when I ask

Blast the challenger way out of space, like Galaga nigga
Battle star Galactica, cross my diameter nigga
Derange your whole circular shape, into triangular nigga
Yo, so what it was my fault?
That I had to bring this shit to a screaming halt?
What you need to do is open up the vault
That's why I make sure, that my vest will be on
So when I blast you, and your additional stress will be gone
Then I sprinkle just a little bit of salt, on your plans
And watch your shit shrivel up right in the palm of my hands
I ain't afraid of ya, but I thank all of my niggas for saving ya
I was about to take you back, to when your mother was making ya
Clapping you up, slapping you up, trapping you up
Holding you hostage, duck taping and Saran wrapping you up
Yo!, first she was sober, I smell aroma
Put you in a Trans, and slip into an irreversible coma
Fuck y'all cubic zirconium niggas, it's over
Closing in on all y'all niggas, while we're moving in a little closer Then I evaluate and elaborate, confiscate your shit
And dare your ass to retaliate, that's when I ask

Checkin out what Flipmode got, mad hip-hop
Chartin number one, drinks in the sun
Eighty times so we can get sponged, shake it hon
All a brother know is make the hit get the dough
Makin grandmas hit the floor, really though
It's my thang my slang
Rich motherfucker, getting chicks at the Rucker
Bringing my team to the joint wit Allen Iverson running on point
Don't smoke a spliff on the joint
And when you see me they on point
Cause I, I be that nigga wit the million dollar figures
Gettin all up in they bitches
Leavin they pussy in stitches, uh

Ayo I'm on to the next level
I'm gettin rich, friends said I switch
I got me a bad chick, live up in the hills
Pay my mom's bills, recoup a half a mil
Still got my deal, pop the 700 Benz-o
You never seen, cash money fiend
A lot of cats wanna dream
Pack a shorty black or Phillipian
The way I eat my shrimp with steam
I'm the man with the gangsta lean, what, what
Yo I split your whole spleen if you know what I mean
Call me little rabcash, I get you for your stash
VIP pass, save all the gas, I make it last

Since Mase refuse to lose, we makes numeral moves
Cause I'm smoother than them dudes and them two thousand dollar shoes
When I move to new Jerus, cause I like the cruise
And my six double-o, blast weed, love the dough
I'm that Goodfell-ay, what the hella they can tell me
Smoke my la la out in LA, who's ready
Juice heavy back in blue Chevy
See Angelettie when a nigga need his chedd-ay
Cause I'm rawer than a broad way
With all A's and platinum
There been many things we touch
Never had a partner so I never had to deduct shit 1.8
And every week I have to re-up
So what, so what

Ay yo, check out the way me and my niggas always be rippin' shit
The way that I display new flavor and do it so intricate
Pitter and patter, patter and pitter all over this shit
Uh uh uh oh, y'all niggas be yappin' till I be sick of it
Hit you with shit that y'all niggas will never ever forget
Fuckin' with my niggas is like you playin' Russian Roulette
Ooh me and my whole platoon coming soon
Nigga make room, we diesel like a bunch of baboons
Hey yo yo, think you can manage all of my niggas damage?
Tryin' to alter our lavish livin' niggas will turn savage

The way my money stack stupid, got 'em flippin around, and got 'em diggin
The sound
I know you look finger lickin
And baby girl, I only use my dough for trickin or chicken
Listen, cooked food shorty fatten my tummy
You can go in and out my slacks, don't touch my money
Even though you lookin good and it was nice to meet ya
You be lucky if you even get a slice of pizza, from me (c'mon)
Before you ever try to touch my money clip
I'll put you on the corner walkin up and down the money strip (now look it
Here)
Honey dip, better find another dummy quick
Homie tryna stunt, better jump inside a money whip (go on)
And see what you can get, and keep it over there
You better try your luck, cause you ain't gettin nothin over here

I think you need to move it to the left

But trip and it's like that, cause I've been a G
Look at the way these women tend to grin at me
I like the way she shake it with a lot of energy
Magnums, alcoholic freaks the remedy
I'm the young Donald Trump, is y'all hearin me?
Girls on the sideline, yeah they cheerin me
Ask her ""can she drive a stick?"" now she steerin me
Man I'm sick, no it ain't no curin me

Make it clap when you seen cats pass through the door (uh)

Chicks attack like he's ""Joe Crack, The Boss""
Played it back, cause I be so paranoid
I got a wife, but baby please don't back it off (uh)
She understood that, said ""what's good, Crack?""
Got me screamin ""where the hood, where the hood rat""
Mami I ain't gotta pop the piston
But the rocks got a gleam, so hard to miss 'em
So I, cut the chase, took her out the place
Put her in a bed, put smile on her face (uh)
She don't know ""Joe Crack the Don""
Never spend no type of real cheese on a broad
All I keep is 100 G's, limit credit cards
Could you believe we could spend it all

Me and my niggas and my clique be gettin' mad cream
Ball in the club, now I'm drunk havin' a bad dream
This muh'fucker tried to greet me with wealth
I never knew that I would see that day that I would meet the devil himself
This nigga was eagerly waitin to prove it
Astonishingly, already dancin to his own burial music
Well anyway, he plottin' to do it to me
In a certain kind of way, and started off directly poppin shit to me
While he spoke a couple of fires would spark
While he sat in the shadow talkin his shit we watched the sky gettin dark - he said

Well isn't you (?) where it hurts, I'll leave you in a rock sample
Straight up leakin in the back of a church
Then I ghost ya crib and haunt you like a ghost in your home
Leavin you old and decrepit like them ruins in Rome
Watch your body shrivel up and turn your ashes to smoke
Fuck your flesh don't get yo blood sucked, the blood of ya foes
I be that nigga that'll torture your spouse
And leave a thousand body bags like truth.com in front of your house

Got me buggin on a whole' nother level
Tell me how the FUCK a nigga really end up havin beef with the devil
Shit bugged the whole effect the nigga had on my dreamin
Body reactin mentally, goin to war with the demon
Semi-chaotic like a typical storm
So embellished in the dream a nigga felt it in the physical form
The dream got my nose runny and shit
Eyes watery, shorty watchin my body twitch funny and shit
Givin shorty sleepin with me the creeps
She buggin off how a nigga just sweatin and breathin so hard in his sleep
Determined to conquer this nigga so let it begin
Absolutely focused on killin the demon within
So now we fight in the name of my brethren
And every blow connect durin the fight you can hear the thunder roll into heaven
Inhale a deep breath of fresh air
The devil's presence blows a cold draft leavin a scent of death in the air
While my mind was reassemblin now
Simultaneous wifey watchin a nigga body tremblin now
Couldn't conquer me so now the devil wanted me dead
Stabbed a nigga with the same bone he ripped from his head
Yo it's funny how the devils'll test us
But it's only select, niggas blessed with somethin so miraculous and precious
Til I'm dead I'm always battlin through
You disbelieve then cut my main vein that all my blood be travelin through
Somebody got to die, settle the score
Because it's me or this nigga, I'm fighting to the death
I'm ready for WAR!!!!!!

The Brooklyn borough king, you bitch to me is everything
Sent me to Jersey, trapped off the parascene, or Penelope Pitstop
You can't duplicate the picture, or record this hip hop!
My owl's are tryna crust up the ziplock
Dime pieces in high heels and flip flops
Real playas, with the Zenty's wristwatch
Outside of clubs, is backed up in gridlock
Three bouncers the size of sasquatch
Plus whips that will make your eyes pop
Hot burns that burn faster than matches
Dirt is only out to catch vicks
See boys on the back on some rap shit
Fake industry heads sweating in the guest list
I'm on the spot with a bottle of fresh Cryst'
Lay up on the table, arm around the best chick
It's all about the money

Hey, I'm O.D.B., let me know ""Where's your money?""
Next time you see me, let me know ""Where's your money?""
Baby, I just got home, let me know ""Where's your money?""
We got to feed these kids, baby, let me know ""Where's your money?""

In a fly, tailor-made suit, cooking a blunt
Got the Phantom, parked, crooked out in the front
Rowing, gun toting, Sonny Chiba niggas we large
Caymen Island style, sucking on cohiba cigars
The way we stack cake, you know I know it's making you sick
Watch dough with diplomats from other countries and shit
Heh, now let me show you why we walk with a swagger
Money over flowing, spending like it don't even matter
Money do a lotta shit, money make me more bread
But money take a nigga life, put a price on they head
Think you nicer than the dreads, niggas fight with the feds
Keep it cool, while I put all of the hype on the bed
Bitch, ever since my cake got a little bigger
Fuck a JP Morgan, Merryl Lynch and them niggas
Fuck it, call it what you wanna call it, nigga, we sinners
Throw my money at ten thousand dollar tables for dinners, now

It's a Busta Bust now, nigga, let me know ""Where's your money?""
Everytime you see me, let me know ""Where's your money?""
You can give me all your money, let me know ""Where's your money?""
When it's the first of the month, nigga, let me know ""Where's your money?""

For the carat D class, next to my middle finger
When I see my own reflection, diamond frost the mirror
Diamonds as cold as ice, frost bite like winter
Floss fitters, three quarter four length chinchillas
You wish you knew the way, the kid'll quiet dough is a mystery
Niggas bread'll stack longer than American History
Heh, now peep the way we runnin' through y'all, it's funny
Fuck around get you murked with my ""Woo-Hah!"" money
Lay you down in the dirt, let me school y'all dummies
Hit the town with the work, like crack heads, they love me
Shit, to call my cake disrespectful bitch, holla
A lot of acres with a pet alligator, named Dollar
Bust it, y'all niggas know that I'm the most, so just stop it
I cop cribs, and stash cake and keepin' money in wallets
Niggas money smaller than a bar of Whatchamacallits
Money hungry like Sudan, when my paper stay brolic

Wild Hot,Rhyme & Reason (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack),1997.0,"I got the Busta Bust
Yo, we make the shit wild hot
(I got Kamaal
Complete, we make the shit wild hot)
I got the Busta Bust
Yo, we make the shit wild hot
All y'all rude boys lick a shot (gun shot)

I be the all-eye-seein'
The MCin', human bein'
Soon to be in your museum
When I'm in your coliseum, I'm MCin'
Punishin' wack niggas for disagreein'
Did you see him?
No, 'cause he move like the wind, in flight
Counter-attack like a Jedi Knight
If you're goin' to think about combatin'
General Patton
Of this MC shit you dick, chillout
You just a private in the lower class
I be the upper echelon
Don Juan, when the mic's on
Chief Abstract, Ace Quasimoto
Fuckin' with me, you'll be finished like photo
I'm sure to bust your shit like Bolo
Black Nation needs a team, fuck solo
I can see it in your eyes, the webness
When your ass starts to cry, it's redness
You can witness the style that I kick from the linguistics
But please come specific
Dealin' with the Tribe, but you never can
My nigga Busta Rhymes about to get his, man
A yo, we do it like this and then we do it like that
It's the Abstract with the new format
We do it like this and then we do it like that
It's the Busta Bust with the new format

FIGARO, Figaro, Figaro
Bust yo' shit, scar yo windpipes and quickly break yo' elbows
Put my foot in your ass slow
Feel the force like a race horse or like a herd of buffalo
Tell me why you be actin' soft
Freak the Spanish flow like Julio ?Lepingpacndahoe?
Freeze like Chilly Willy
, the Eskimo
Vigilante like Steven Seagal
 or Bust the desperado
You fuckin' with the all-time pros
While the zoom lens aim on weak niggas from transistor radios
Mission Impossible without expose
Once I diagnose those who be creepin' blow 'em off they tippy toes
Sorry, fake nigga that's how it goes
Sport the suede-front bullet proof vests in case you complicate my dough
Handle situations pronto
Appearances got you all hearin' this when I be doin' cameos
Shit be Wild Hot like Tabasco
Fuck the fool-ass nigga trespass and caught him in my lasso
Stick a nigga bad like the last hole
Runnin' up on muthafuckas late night jumpin' out the Astro
No, No, No, No, No
If you violate I start to dictate just like Fidel Castro
Make you dreadlock yo' afro
And when I'm done I ride off to theme music by my man D'Angelo
We make the shit Wild Hot",https://genius.com/Busta-rhymes-wild-hot-lyrics
Respect My Conglomerate 2,The Return of the Dragon: The Abstract Went On Vacation,2015.0,"This motion picture is being presented to you by the conglomerate entertainment
Please be advised that you should consider this as a warning

Now we came here to demonstrate
All the real live shit that we create
We the master of the street fuck what you heard
Cause everything else is quite absurd
And you know we keep it tight, that's what they say
And when you whip it in your truck just bang this everyday
We won't stop rockin', we comin' correct
And all these rappers can't stand us but give us respect

Stop what you're doing ‘cause I'm about to ruin
The image and the style that you're used to
You see we droppin' that strong shit, more powerful and dominant
So just respect my conglomerate

Look, bitch I'm back, it's bigfoot
Giant King Kong boss presence, they've been shook, try it now
Lock the street, let the kid cook, tie it down
Don't be mad when your bitch look, quiet down
You don't sound too convincing
Low stamina rap niggas, you need ginseng
I godfather this shit, pinky ring king
I bomb shit, nuclear missiles is whistling
(Now ya'll niggas wanna run and hide like roaches)
Cargo of coke on them boats, let the ships in
It's been a drought, coke prices is up, ching-ching
Shell a nigga from Brooklyn house to Sing Sing
Cold winters get real warm, hailstorm
Like the shakin' and beefin' in jail dorms
Got a nigga beastin' aware, I'm in rare form
Now watch how they respectin' when ringin' the air horn

Stop what you're doing ‘cause I'm about to ruin
The image and the style that you're used to
You see we droppin' that strong shit, more powerful and dominant
So just respect my conglomerate

With success comes stress if it's my grind
So I light up every night nigga, skyline
I keep gettin' better, they should call me fine wine
While these used-to-bes wish they filled with my time
But nah, it is what it fuckin' is
And goin' hard is just a part of the fuckin' biz
No porno, right now I'm in the Bordeaux
We usually in a pair of ""damn I never saw those""
Glass of pink for everybody
They say stay hungry and never thirsty
So I'm buyin' drinks for everybody
Problem is that I can't link with everbody
And nowadays everybody think they everybody
You think you Big Meech? No you don't
Bring the strip club to the house? No you won't
And I'd invite you to the top but I'm sure
It's for real niggas and you'd get stopped at the door

Stop what you're doing ‘cause I'm about to ruin
The image and the style that you're used to
You see we droppin' that strong shit, more powerful and dominant
So just respect my conglomerate
[Verse 4: Jadakiss + 
Styles P
]
Yeah, a real nigga never worry bout what a coward do
Time is money
So I respect what an hour do
One phone call
And the posse'll shower you
You know my regime is 
much more powerful
Same plans of course
Every gram is nos
Get charged to the game cause every man's a boss
Respect my conglomerate, nigga
Cash in the stash and the mask
My connect is anonymous
You don't wanna problem with
Niggas that get your momma hit
No death where the flesh rule
Nigga I'm the shit no restroom
No room to rest
Them niggas'll test you
See where it gets you
Baptize these rap guys, the gat flies
Cocaine crack pies, big niggas get half size
When the sword hits the waist or the four hits the face
He gone need a prayer, put the call into Ma$e
I put it all in the coke
Put it all in the Chase
All in Wachovia
All in the H
9mms and Tec-9's, you will respect mines

Stop what you're doing ‘cause I'm about to ruin
The image and the style that you're used to
You see we droppin' that strong shit, more powerful and dominant
So just respect my conglomerate",https://genius.com/Busta-rhymes-respect-my-conglomerate-2-lyrics

Tryin to kill or stop us, jack our propers
Busta Bus, they fakin, the cake is for the takin
While they runnin they face, I'm lettin the plan bake
Formulate, now look at the plot, we got
More and more shit that's hot, show to rock the spot
Clock or knot, nigga the whole pot
Ready or not, we comin, snatchin every comer
Witcha ho in the Benz-O, dumbin like a motherfucker

You can be my lady, you could even be my lollipop sucker
The road dawg baby comin like the mad trucker
Lot of jealous niggas lookin funnier than Chris Tucker
God bless, oh yes, I stay fresh
Full of finesse, my congress show progress
Stylish, hit you with the shit to digest
In this rhyme shit we be some of the world's finest
Your Highness, leavin corny niggas spineless
Attack it with the classic rhyme flow timeless (ha ha)

Not a problem my squad can't fix

Hang the little plot you got, don't sweat it main

Y'all don't know shit about Jamal or what I'm in it for:
Cash, cars, fly whores and tours
Fillin my pipe, with no messes and no limits
Them other one scrimpin, has the tent froze frigid
Fraud as a gimmick, dick lickin chasin chickens
I mash for the cash with the click and
Rip a show then I'm dippin in the whip and high trippin

While y'all niggas hoppin and skippin I stick the clip in, yo
Accelerate on the gas, move fast
Blast, find a nigga FOOT in your ass
Colorful niggas, just peep the whole contrast
Flipmode is the Squad, a news flash
Bust your shit up, what the fuck, nigga get up
Violate, niggas get they whole SHIT lit up!
Break fool, niggas know the rules, rob jewels
Champagne bath, throw the Moet in the pool
Nigga caught a motherfuckin strain on the brain
Ridin on the train, I'mma whip a Benz in the rain
Oversized click on the rise so realize we be
Dem niggas that dead up all you funny little small fries

Now motherfuckin case closed
The shit blow your speaker, keep turnin your base low
Spaz out because I motherfuckin say so
Before I blow this bitch like we down in Waco
Thick in cock diesel, that's the way we roll
Big truck shit, even my bitch whippin' the Range Rov'
We 'bout to skyrocket and THE WAY WE GO
The way the bitches lookin love THE WAY WE BLOW
Check it, we light shit up like Broadway yo
The crack-head rappers better just say no
Before I turn stupid and back the heat slow
Lay and wait for niggas in the back street yo
Weak flow, take your shit like I'm comin to Repo
Create a crowd scene and stack a bunch of people
We bustin through the doors, shootin through your peephole
The shoot that never miss is like shootin a free throw
All you niggas better go and..

Call the ambulance, come and pick up your people
Call the ambulance, come and pick up your people
Call the ambulance, come and pick up your people
Put they body on the stretcher, carry they ass out

The party's on smash, now we tweakin it up
The bitches want this dick so they eatin it up
 Now all you bitches better go and..

We shut it down in every function
Beat you in yo' head until your brain malfunction
Yo Bust, call the label, tell 'em we in production
Pinky ring status so it's no discussion
Stop talkin shit, niggas dodgin and duckin
I'm cream cheese with the english muffin
I still got respect in the Flatbush junction, HEY

Huh, it's like we shakin down a dude
We like a pack of dogs that come to take a nigga food
My niggas flip quicker than a fucking interlude
I beat niggas head and blood drippin through a tube
Peep bitch, I'm only here to change the fuckin mood

And leave you in the church watchin your body gettin viewed

Gun blunt you, and rep for every thug capital
Diagonal vision, niggas seein' shit on slant
Plant beatings on niggas and celebrate a war chant
Diabolic how we manifest raw logic
Chronological time, we bring niggas the raw project
Hold fort and represent as the grand wizard
Street chronicle illustrate the bakin' of a bad blizzard
I got a spot for ya
With live niggas who murder sloppier
Than all of the Trenchcoat Mafia yo
Cause when you hear the sweet music playin'
It's like theme music for murder scenes
Like the Colorado slayin' 'cause I don't give a fuck
Speedin like we racin' on the Aqueduct
Black tinted-out, government truck
Curbside on niggas, leanin' just a little bit
Trunk trapped with smoke, my bitch'll take a little hit
Fake niggas could be the BEST actors
My bullets whiz so fast you feel the wind chill factors
In the wrong place you get your WIG peeled backwards
Get an ounce of the 'dro and STEAM a pack of Blackwoods

Someone, so special (can I have a word wit'chu baby)

Miss can I get a second to speak and quietly mention
That I am so into who you are, can I get your attention
My observations of you creates conversations for you
And if you got a little time, I got the patience for you
Okay? Good, you givin me the time to talk?
While I figure it out and sort what I'm tryin to say, let's walk
Just tryin to keep it gutter, respectfully I won't stutter
Don't you agree, we look better when we walk with each other?
I've seen you many times, yes I've encountered many dimes
I'm feelin somethin special with us, it's just one of the many signs
I think that we have to look forward to our go-through
Any war with you regardless what it is I'm tryin to score with you
Sometimes I think and wonder especially through rain and thunder
If I'd ever find the one to ride when I'm on top or under
Until we reach the end, ma with love as I be your friend
Oh; here you can take my number, I hope we can speak again

No matter how mister, you know that I'll die wit'cha
Until the end of life, lay down on the ground wit'cha
I'll give my life to you; I hope it all comes true
Ready to start for you, I give all my heart to you
And when together I hope we never fall apart sugar
Now that it feels so good; our thoughts are understood

I'd like to learn from ya, but I'm 'bout to turn from ya
It's been about a week and I ain't even heard from ya
Is it somethin at all or did I just bump in and fall
And even though you did I see how you was reluctant to call
But it's nothin to crawl before we walk (OOH) listen
And it's nothin to stall before we talk - look
To tell the truth I'm happy I found you and that I can be around you
And thus I'm diggin you, I ain't just tryin to pound you
I'm only tryin to crown you and wife you and wedding gown you
Regardless what I'm with, shorty seem like she always down to
Just spend a little time and then CLICK, you know that kind of chemistry
The recipe to then SIP, and a little bit of wine
Mami, I like your conduct, light the fireworks and bombs up
The type of chick I wanna talk about when I call my moms up
Until the love is empty I credit the one who sent me
The most BEAUTIFULLEST woman and she ridin with me

(I'll do it all) I'll do it all wit'cha, go through any door wit'cha
It doesn't matter I will, go against the law wit'cha
Just know you live through me; your love is all I need
If you ain't know you make me, no one's ever shown you baby
To tell the truth {?} you've got me goin crazy
Your love so real to me; and that's all that I, can see

This is a thing I wanna feel forever, and I ain't goin nowhere
Cause you mean so much to me
No matter how my people try to doubt ya, I know the truth about ya
It doesn't matter to me
Baby I love you and I always told ya, I'm always here to hold ya
Cause you do so much for me
No matter how they try they can't deceive us, nothin can come between us
Cause you mean so much to me

Listen; trust me and I will trust you, I ain't into tryin to fuss boo
Deeper than any lust, I'm only tryin to mindfuck you
That's probably why and maybe I can nickname you my baby
Now that you made me a man you're officially now my lady
Despite the stormy weather I cherish your love forever
And nourish everything we have 'til we grow old together
I'll never trick you, mislead or try to be shaky wit'chu
I only wanna make all the rest of my babies wit'chu

As hollow tips get in you
Bots cutting to slice your face you

Up in the crack capsule
Flipmode cruddy styles has been past you
Rush pass

If it was under your nose
Like a mustache
Nigga
What ass
Show your whole cheek
Slugs with no heat
Diamonds that don't break
You thugs is so sweet

I float so much I get seasick
Flipmode is the Squad who I bees with
Who I get plucks with
And push German V's with
Rampage I'm psychic I can see shit
'Til the next millennium
You not gon be shit
Scratch your name off the list
Cut your wrist
You know the issue
I'm official
When you die none of your niggas is really gon miss you

Against all odds, still remain gods
Grup your arm, we always come hard
The world is ours, call a National Guard

Here we go
Any bitch that rhyme wanna flex she ass
I'm stomping all things like I'm plexi-glass
Niggas make way like when they hear sirens
Treat you like parking too close to fire hydrants
All up in the board
Kicking back long islands
Get your wig split first solid defiance
Rah Earth and sun in this Imperial alliance
You do the science

Fall off beeper uh-uh niggas stay getting
Dirty nigga for life

That bang Makaveli in trucks
That whatever the fuck to give a cheddar in chunks
Fugazi chains
Fake thugs with lazy aid
Track marks
Rap stars
And a raid of aids

Yo, what you want from us
Now visualize more of us
Stay toting under my given flavor from Nauticas
Destroy every arch-rival or any challenger
Make you remember this day
Nigga mark it on your calendar
I'm showing you something
You ain't saying nothing

Like a bunch of volcanoes erupting
None of y'all niggas really wanna war

The Finish Line,The Coming,1996.0,"This is dedicated to all those who don't see it coming...

You can live true, baby, you can live trife
Whatever way you chose, you got to leave your life
Ayo, you're running out of time, and you 'bout to cross
The finish line, the finish line
You can live true, baby, you can live trife
Whatever way you chose, you got to leave your life
Ayo, you're running out of time, and you 'bout to cross
The finish line, the finish line

And, yo! I can't afford to waste a second
Steppin' with my eyes on niggas checkin' on my weapons
Every millisecond, motherfuckers say they true to this
But when they grab the microphone they shit sound like stupidness
Hah, mad to pull another vicious scandal
I know that you can't handle when I hip from other angles now
Feel my hot wax, burning from my melting candles
You can't take the heat, so you switch from boots to wearing sandals
This is for example! Shit will make a nigga curse
When worse comes to worst, you be the first to disperse now
We don't BELIEVE your man was living like that
Hoping to find that nigga see exactly where his heart was at
It's a damn shame how Son know your style, know your name
Watch how he pull your file, make you wish you never fuckin came NOW
Even the hardest motherfucker has his final day
So kill that shit you talkin, and be about your fuckin way

You can live true, baby, you can live trife
Whatever way you chose, you got to leave your life
Ayo, you're running out of time, and you 'bout to cross
The finish line, the finish line
You can live true, baby, you can live trife
Whatever way you chose, you got to leave your life
Ayo, you're running out of time, and you 'bout to cross
The finish line, the finish line

Yo, everyday I see you on the block smoking
With a bunch of niggas scoping on how they can split you WIDE open
You don't even know what's going on up in your circle
Awful murder niggas itch to leave you black blue and purple
Ahh, your man came to put you on and tried to make you breathe
Hit you with some shit that left you flippin mad in disbelief
You just can't believe that niggas that you smoke with is on it
And the way they rass they really got to bust yo' shit!
Thought your man was joking, paid no attention to the situation
Got with your crew and just continued smoking
Now your man sit and watch you panic
In any other situation you'd be fronting like you gigantic
I guess all that fronting is your main talent
It's apparent, he can see right through you like you transparent
Hah, aiyyo you need to watch your back you running out of time
Watch your step, cuz you only inches from the finish line

You can live true, baby, you can live trife
Whatever way you chose, you got to leave your life
Ayo, you're running out of time, and you 'bout to cross
The finish line, the finish line
You can live true, baby, you can live trife
Whatever way you chose, you got to leave your life
Ayo, you're running out of time, and you 'bout to cross
The finish line, the finish line

Now, there's about a million motherfuckers on your trail
Quick to bust your shit for every single time your words failed
I'm watchin' all the moves you makin' fuck the speculatin'
Super-bitch nigga you just be fakin' if I'm not mistaken
Every move you fake you dig your grave a little deeper
Come around me with that shit I'mma flip it to my brother's keeper
Listen to this: overstress my emphasis
I insist to fix and bring the noise as long as I exist
Now you walk around the streets with all that shit you speak
And step inside the club just to receive the illest ass beating
HOO! Take a look around you get no type of sympathy
Impatiently, I sit and watch you die in your own iniquity
Hah, now you out dead and stinkin', and your eyes are no longer blinkin'
Time caught up quick, with your little BITCH way of thinkin'
Ahh, watch you diminish, while your niggas have to put a finish
On your misleading false image

You can live true, baby, you can live trife
Whatever way you chose, you got to leave your life
Ayo, you're running out of time, and you 'bout to cross
The finish line, the finish line
You can live true, baby, you can live trife
Whatever way you chose, you got to leave your life
Ayo, you're running out of time, and you 'bout to cross
The finish line, the finish line
You can live true, baby, you can live trife
Whatever way you chose, you got to leave your life
Ayo, you're running out of time, and you 'bout to cross
The finish line, the finish line
You can live true, baby, you can live trife
Whatever way you chose, you got to leave your life
Ayo, you're running out of time, and you 'bout to cross

You can live true, baby, you can live trife

You shall be willing to give your life
Before your words shall fail

They’re Out to Get Me,The Big Bang,2006.0,"They see my name and lifestyle and say I changed (how I be so raaawww)
They so cold... I know... that they're out to get me
And all those people I call my friends, let it go
That's why I never call on y'all, to be around
Cause you see how this money can change everything

Geah! See I done came a long way and now I got me a chauffeur
Keep my enemies close, keep my friends even closer
Muhfuckers that I grew around, thought I could rock wit 'em
Watch my cake so hard, they burn a hole in my pocket
I see 'em coming from afar because I been through so much shit
They plot a lot, hard or not, they see my dough come quick
Invested in my niggas, took the realtor route
Gambled on the wrong niggas, had to filter 'em out
Type of dudes that see my mother and they greet her respectful
Behind her back and see her son and try to give me a quick full
It's cool though, I fucks wit 'em even though I ain't wit it
That's why the gats be in the house whenever niggas come visit
Serve 'em drinks and welcome all to the law
For let ya drunk friend to show his true side until ya forced to cut him off
I seen it one too many times, your peeps be leaving you speechless
Sometimes having certain friends can end up being a weakness
See now my dogs turn to wolves and try to front me and surround me
Come up out they sheepskin and act all different around me

They see my name and lifestyle and say I changed (how I be so raaawww)
They so cold... I know... that they're out to get me
And all those people I call my friends, let it go
That's why I never call on y'all, to be around
Cause you see how this money can change everything

Listen! Sometimes I smoke a cigarette and then I think and I choke on
How niggas steal this funny style and I was struggling broke
Even though it don't surprise me, shit it's still kinda funny
When I ain't have, a nigga still would come and try to take from me
Instead of cutting my losses, being smart and just end shit
Niggas was trying to be loyal, just to maintain a friendship
In the wrong situation, plus there's always a sequel
I'm with the wrong muhfuckers, plus they 'pose to be people's
As I get more money, days get colder
I learned to realize that power only lies in the hands of the beholder
So then I start the heart-on-my-heart as I walk like a soldier
Moving so militant, you think I had a chip on my shoulder
Living by morals and principles mainly
Having heavy thoughts to a kill my brother every time them fuckers betray me
But now I'm winning with the strength of the nation
I promise that they not even foreseeing the size of the shit they'll be facing
I'm Aftermath now, shit's getting worse
Now when those same ""friends"" see me goin hard that shit be making 'em hurt

They see my name and lifestyle and say I changed (how I be so raaawww)
They so cold... I know... that they're out to get me
And all those people I call my friends, let it go
That's why I never call on y'all, to be around
Cause you see how this money can change everything

Instead they getting together with me so we both can get rich
When I'm outta town, these niggas busy tryna fuck with my bitch
Same niggas spend they money 'til the shit'll diminish
I hit 'em off and turn around and come right back when it finish
I said I'm tired of these niggas, that'll owe me so much shit
That they can't pay me back for, fuck all the dumb shit
Sometime we can't forgive whatever balances off
'Specially when niggas cross the line that niggas never should cross
Realized and thus I state the same shit, get the Range
The more money niggas get, shit around you will change
Even though niggas'll flip and say, ""You the one changed""
Fuck you, they do that just to justify takin your shit from you
The more money I get, I get more dangerous stupid
Cause I been broke before, and I refuse to go back to it
And while I sweep these niggas up under the rug with a broom
If I never see these ""friends"" again, that shit'll be too soon
Shit is real like every wind in my breath
And that's on everything I love, BLOOD OF MY BLOOD! FLESH OF MY FLESH!

They see my name and lifestyle and say I changed (how I be so raaawww)
They so cold... I know... that they're out to get me
And all those people I call my friends, let it go

Don't act dumb scheming on a robbery outcome
Come out from wherever you are and be outdone
Acting like you about something, and you ain't about none
Come on son! Thought the chicken head was a little rude
The wrong move making me whip it out like live dude
Fuck that trick tried to get at my hard-earned stack
Too many times, gotta put my foot in her ass crack

Intro,When Disaster Strikes...,1997.0,"As we approach the current time frame of 1997
With approximately two and a half years before the year 2000
Repeatedly it has been reported that there will be a time soon approaching
That major disaster will be striking all levels of existence
It has also been reported that this disastrous thing will be approaching
In the form of many many, as in squad squad, as in Flipmode Squad
It has also been reported that everyone out of the many will strike
But this particular motherfucker will strike with an unmeasurable
Blast and fuck up everything within his 360 degree radius
Warning: Prepare yourselves! Store your food, stamp your paper
Because when this motherfucker gets here, it's about to get real fucked up
For everyone and everything, everywhere!

See now, Dolomite just got back from some shit that you about to be in
Well, are you prepared?
I hope you are prepared nigga, 'cause you know this is album number two

There'll be more bitches, more and more and more
More thirsty niggas tryin' to get inside your shit
Tryin' to throw your whole chemistry off
Oh yes, there's gonna be a lot more money
Yes, a lot more money than before
So son, don't you worry about none of that shit
All you gotta do is just slap your dick in the mouth of these bitches that don't wanna act right
And put a hot one in any motherfucker that wants to get in the way of this power move shit right here
Ok son, all right Busta, enough of this shit talkin'! Let's be on our way
'Cause when disaster strikes, there's gonna be a whole lot of motherfuckers pourin' in
All right baby, lets go!

What it do, what it do all day
Come through and get it jumpin'
Throwin' money away
It don't matter if you're hustlin' a bundle of yay
Or you got a 9 to 5
Let the champagne spray
Boom click a little don of the red rosé
Two chicks on my arm when I step okay
Gillette razor sharp
You know the boy don't play
BC ten drop me in St. Tropez
Let the money machine roll on
We been needin' a nigga like you in the street so long
Everytime you drops yakkin'
You do no wrong
I progress you and your little crew prolong
I know your forte
We blind your little shine
Fuck what you portrait
While you leave
Your lil chick wanna stay
And if you violate
I assure you'll all gon' pay


Hey girl
The god's back in town
You ain't gonna wanna miss it
When the shit go down
We celebratin' like we throwin' money around
Bring a lot of 'tron
We bout to order a couple of rounds Look
I know at times it probably seem like the hardest
When you ain't got it
But you gotta go and get it regardless
Check it
Get on your hustle homie
Get up and go
And do it proper
For the veteran knows
And go and cop an island
And do a lot so I can stack up a roll
With a couple billion with a stash in the flow
Up in the mansion, listen
I'm only tellin' you the theme of this caper
Is get your paper
Let's keep it goin'


Kiddie bangin' at random
And the way the nigga hustle
It's like he's throwin' a tantrum
Tryin' to hustle
Cop a plane
A couple ships, nigga, and some
You hustle up on the block
Some niggas hustle at random
Now
As long as you can go and muscle a grip
Whether you shinin' from a grind
Or you hustle legit
Either way get money nigga
Turn on the switches
For power hustlin'
And stack all your riches
That's how we on it",https://genius.com/Busta-rhymes-hustlers-anthem-09-lyrics

Please somebody get 'em up

A thing of the past, because them niggas stuck you all
One shot bustin' the same bullet, struck you all
And when they bounce you hear voices screamin' ""FUCK YOU ALL""
Gathered up about a thousand young ?box? who brawl
As decoys, in case they needed to duck you all
That's why you better move tight with your click
Niggas be thirsty and quick
Just to be off into the night with your shit

Are you ready to get on? (Who, me?)
And cause such a reaction that the mothafuckas go (Ooh wee)
It's like a group of happy children
Yo, it's such a feelin'
To see all of my live nigga's carry on now
Oh see how I be gettin' so passionate
I get a thrill even when I bust my gun off by accident
The God bless glory, success story
Whiteboy Billy put a stash up in my armrest for me
The way I fucks it up, it's like a fuck-fest for me
I get on last and demolish everything before me
We run shit and that's a fact now, you're whack now
And ain't no fuckin' turnin' back now, so relentless
I won't even let you niggas finish a fuckin' sentence
Call for my people like a school attendance
And then I strike with a fuckin' vengeance
Finger on my trigger
Figure I'll blast every last one of you bitch niggas

Flipmode the most reliant for the thorough guidance
On how to get most of this money like a secret science
Only the live nigga's allowed, there's nothin' you can do
Frontin' with your crew while you talkin' to corny bitches too
Nevertheless, address the cheddar for the treasure chest
And bless the spot before the thugs protest, one time
I hope y'all know just what the motherfuck you dealin' with
With so much platinum for the street, you thought I was a silversmith
We phat now, so look at how we brought it back now
And made it possible for street niggas to hold a stack now
And become the wealthiest, healthiest
And bring the fire that will reach about 1000 degrees celsius
Hold on, banker's money better roll on, or sing a broke folk song
My nigga's so long he paid with a big brim hat, just like a lampshade
And bounce, wildin' in the truck, the joints my nigga Ramp made
We be them new millennium prime time niggas
Walk a fine line, niggas sippin fine wine niggas
Now, if you cross the line and fuck around them blind niggas
With so much pressure it's like we did the illest crime, nigga
What? You know I'm like a loco man, noble man
Turned global man, rippin' bi-coastal like a postal man
And when we come, you know we came to get it
And what you need to do is bounce if you ain't fuckin' with it

Come on!

Hey, come on, hey, whether it's for more or less
You best believe Busta Rhymes, more flavor than all the rest
From all the mess, hardcoreness from all the stress
Gotsta get this flawless flow from off my chest
Who's responsible for the impossible flow?
Ain't a thing in the world that ain't copable, so, so
I make you anticipate great
Type shit real live niggas appreciate
To the utmost I pack toast, keep the gat close
Run niggas to the island of Patmos
After the gun burst, quench my blood thirst
We will be leavin' you much worse in one hearse
Yo, now we embellish, fuck the jealous
And embark on niggas, now what you gon' tell us?
Skydiver, short circuit just like a live wire
And give it to niggas because we got the FIRE!

All my people in the place (Iyyiiiyyiiiiyyiiiiyyiiiii)
Just put your hands up in the air
And while we blow the spot and keep it hot
You got that FIRE!
Jump, shake, bounce when we come to you turn you out
It's Flipmode Squad that keeps on right your rightest place
We got that FIRE!

Ayo, rock until I'm gone
'Til the party's over and they start turnin' the lights on
Type of shit, my entire whole crew be on
Leave the bullshit, so keep movin' on
No, I ain't havin' it
While you grabbin' it, my flow is immaculate
Passionate when it comes to the fire that you have to get
Then I tackle it and kill like the jackal and gaffle it
Rob niggas and give it to the church so they can raffle it
Now you can't distinguish how
I relinquish flow in broken English
Witness how we stay hot and how we keep it scorchin'
Women flossin' blow the spot often
(WHAT) niggas say (WHAT) you need to calculate
Re-evaluate your shit talk 'fore we retaliate
Marinate, when I used to hustle and carry weight
And bust up niggas like you would have flee the state
Hits for niggas like y'all, I hits for only when it counts
Black on the set and make motherfuckers bounce
Connected the raw types of shit
To make your bitch bug and make niggas pull out quick
Y'all niggas wack, yo; I stack dough, and pack a rap show
And then let all of my niggas in the back door
And let the spot short circuit just like a live wire
And give it the niggas because we got the FIRE!

All my people in the place (Iyyiiiyyiiiiyyiiiiyyiiiii)
Just put your hands up in the air

Can be devestatin.. to your ear.. to your mind..
To your body.. to your souuuuuuuuuuuuuullll!

You better, pack up your bags, better get out of town
Cause when the God come you know he gon' be puttin it down
Everything we do be blowin, better get on the ground

He keeps it wicked by creatin the sound
That make the people wanna spaz 'til they give him the crown
Fuck around you'll turn up missin just to never be found
It ain't safe no more, it ain't safe no more (nigga)

Bodies'll turn up missin, I promise you need to listen
Abolish the need for bitchin, I polish and shine and glisten
Demolishin while I'm whistlin, astonished while you're witnessed
Hardest to smash another artist son, regardless if it is
A nigga who think he the greatest son I'll lock him in the fridge
And hang him from both of his ankles when we drop him from the bridge
Blockin your paper really stoppin that dude from gettin his
Poppin the safe and splurgin, havin the crew up in the crib
Block 'til these niggas havin 'em rockin gargle with a bib
Shittin and fartin, spittin and vomitin all in the crib
Fallin into shock from the bullets we shot up in they ribs
Hot up the block and blew up the spot and got up out the mix
Tried it a couple stops and spotted the Squad up in they whips
Plotted and then I signed on the dotted line and made a wish
Return us even the hardest makin you garbage niggas sit
The smartest now you a target only the heartless niggas win


You can't believe can you, I'm callin my dog Nathaniel
And ballin with all my mans you'll be blowin and all will hand you
Accordingly or disorderly bullets are sure to bang you
Considerably my 9 milli hit you at any angle
Shootin, shootin, shootin - high, low, verticle or horizontal
And if you were makin plans I do think you gon' have to cancel
Sorry I had to ask you, save it I have to blast you
Takin a chance to laugh from you makin the masses gas you
So now you thinkin that you tough and that we can't get at you
Change up your mind and leave you stiffer than a massive statue
Tired of talkin need to use all your precautionary measures
Washin off the blood haulin the water force of steady weather
You can handle it or you can't, it be only gettin better
Like a candle, we burn your chandles and make you feel the pressure
Cockin it back, articulatin the flow just like a lecture
Break it down and rebuildin the flow, now peep the architecture

It ain't safe.. in the current state.. of our democracy
Terrorism.. motherfuckers bombin New York.. shit is crazy
It ain't safe no more!
All these rappin niggas goin at other rappin niggas heads
Shit is crazy! But most importantly..
The most unsafe thing.. is that.. niggas ain't seein, the God comin

I'm bout to rope 'em in, a bunch of bitch niggas are being extradited
You soundin' so sloppy, like a broken muffler draggin behind, an old jalopy
Once the bomb drops, here's the aftermath
Scientists tried to dissect the way, I formulate my craft
Worrying 'bout how I achieve things
The way I analyze shit and how I percieve things
My style is real, like lamb skin imported from the Persian
Follow my excursion, all the way 'til you feelin' the new revised version

Your Loss,The Return of the Dragon: The Abstract Went On Vacation,2015.0,"You said you wouldn't mind so I'll go on without ya
If you wanna shine, I'll bet you shine without me
Cause I been too good to let you take me down
 is that you drive me to drinking
I'm feeling good and really good about me
So now that I know how to get it for myself
This is really your loss

Now seen them was the days
When a nigga ain't ever really had shit
And a nigga might of stole some shit
Cause a nigga ain't ever really
Have a pot to piss inside of
I was kinda hard-headed
And I was the type
That'll quickly put the ratch up to you
Nigga being hard-headed
And they never learn
Till a mother fucker catch up to you
Older folk in the neighborhood
Did their very best to really come try teach us
Every time they'd bounce they return
Just to catch us on the corner smokin' them reefers
Do a lot of dirt, do a lot of crime on the block for bread
While the older folk were on their way home from church
Every single time they'd see use they shakin' they head
At the time when a nigga really needed some money
Know a nigga really followed deception
All the older gangsters though a nigga needed direction
So when the gangsters looked at a little nigga
And they really seen they reflection
Niggas gave me the trey eight special
Said a nigga needed protection
A lot of mu'hfuckers that I thought I was cool wit'
Was kinda hatin' me under... the surface
Niggas really wished the worst for me
Like I'm 'posed to suffer
But I wish the best for a nigga like you
But what you don't know about me
Is that I'm really destined for this shit
Let's see you do it without me

You said you wouldn't mind so I'll go on without ya
If you wanna shine, I'll bet you shine without me
Cause I been too good to let you take me down
 is that you drive me to drinking
I'm feeling good and really good about me
So now that I know how to get it for myself
This is really your loss

Lemme get up on my hustle
And I hit the strip
When I whip it and I dip and I boast
Sometimes the street might
Try to bite a nigga that's why I drive with the toast
Sometime the block'll have a nigga feelin'
Like a nigga crept with a ghost
It's nothin' though cause you we been a hood
That's why we reppin the most
See the gutter life'll do it to you
All you niggas on the grind
And you go in to hustle for paper
Nigga watch these broke niggas try to bring it to you
No need to fight you to shine
Cause I was one of them
Hungry little hustlelin' niggas
Who always gotta think big
And you know a nigga stuck with the grind
I wonder if it's really for the better or for the worse
These niggas that you thought was the closest to you
End up becoming them niggas thats
Crossing the line first
So I take it
All inside cause I guess its all a part of our growth
You know I gotta keep my eyes on a lotta niggas that I always
Thought was my folks
Violate in any way
You think a nigga ain't gon' hurt you?
Just cause you bitch don't mean you can't catch it
Nigga better move from my circle
I wish the best for dudes like you
But what you don't know about me
Is that I'm really destined for this shit
Let's see you do it without me

You said you wouldn't mind so I'll go on without ya
If you wanna shine, I'll bet you shine without me

Pull up in the whip, pop the trunk, feel it?
Barefoot gorilla baboon funk, ya hear it?
Me and my nigga Richie was itchy to meet some women
Met some chickens, they was actin so snobby and bitchy, fuck it
Pass me the sticky
The chicky wanted to leave me with a kiss and a hickie
I ain't wit it but give me a quicky, I ain't in to doin the licky-licky
Even though you be lookin so pretty, I own all of my shit, never 50-50
Oodle noodles all 'dose fools never refuse, accuse me for the bruise
Chick got a rattling sound, better tighten the screws
Runnin and gunnin, kinda stunnin
The way we be comin around, slummin, wylin and dollin
My nigga Horace kick up a nigga like Chuck Norris
Got some other niggas lost way up in the forest
Hang you up in a harness, label me and all of my niggas the hardest
Fuck around, be the next ""Formerly Known As"" artist
Layed out with a goddess, pretty lilly Adonis
Besides all of that, niggas is novice, I make you all a promise
The promise is that I'm so dominant and that I am so prominent
Captured the whole of Asia as a continent
Oh shit, I be comin and tumblin down, rumblin, stumblin down
Freaky prophet with unusual musical sound
Bringin the ruckus, you motherfuckers be givin me pounds

Yo! Pin or a needle, make you wobble or weeble

Hit you wit so much drama make niggas always wait for the sequel
Yo there ain't no equal on how we be reppin for the people
Yo there really ain't no equal.....
Ask Hillary, met her down on Flatbush and Tillory
She killin me, got me crazy, wylin, actin straight grizzly
We never made it too far together
I left her standin on Franklin and Willoughby
Another mystery to me
While she still on the corner kissin at me, hissin at me
Ignorin these bitches, they're angry, now they're riffin at me
Vital and critical, literal lyrical, make niggas pitiful
Go to the clinical, examine your physical
Frightening and enlightening at the same time
Get the goods and price them, and doin the heist again
You thinkin we would be nice again
We on a mission, we don't need none of your advice again

What Do You Do When You’re Branded,It Ain’t Safe No More...,2002.0,"Branded... scorned is the one who raaaan
What do you do when your branded? And you know you're a man
Wherever you go, for the rest of your life
You must proooooove, you're a man

See now I'm back wit the force, read about the kid
From the front to the back of The Source
You see me back on the course
Scream on every beat untill my voice get crackled and horse
Front seat niggas never sit in the back wit a boss
Fuck the fact that it cost, the pricetag of the porche
Will cost ya life, have ya motha feel an immaculate loss
*Breath* But of course, come and speak to the best
And watch me spit a jewel sharper to carve the meat of your flesh
You lookin weak in the chest, you see the street is a test
Women on the stoop smokin holdin a seed to they breast
You see the street is a mess
Strugglin holdin a couple pounds of weed then the rest
Now I proceed to the rest of my niggas Keepin it fresh
Though we must stay on the grind I supersceded the stress
We always seem to finesse from the East to the West
You Know we w-w-we keep the teflon from the street to the vest
Kill that nigga slow like how you get defeated in chess
Got you under pressure--hairline receaded effects
Hot air niggas I only feel the heat from your breath
Rap niggas beef in they album probably needed the press
And as a man I never found the slightest need to impress
Another man because I'm proud and I believe that I'm blessed
But yo I always found the need to adress these weaker niggas
That speak to the street always keepin the people abreast
Now you've been branded...


Higher science and I'm changin the crime in
Watch my son cuz you'd be fuckin wit the child of a Giant
Im in a place stuck between bein lovin and violent, *voice switch*
Becomin more of a threat when I move subtle and silent
Then set it off to be the only one to quiet the riot
My destiny's the only thing between the sky and the pilot
Relate, it's like bustin a 3-8
Be late, I be takin most of the brick leavin a pile outta shape
I never quit watchin these niggas try to hide they mistake
Takin a shit watchin they body floatin by in the lake
Make it quick you weak niggas better try to escape
And create the quickest way to reach the fire escape
Snitch niggas always quick to go and lie on a tape
But it's o-k cuz Super Hero niggas die wit a cape
It's so great to watch them finally break, stand aside from the fake
Street niggas gotta slide for the take//
Bein broke and not bein able to buy me a steak
Stackin my paper so see now I can buy an estate
So I rely on the love and I reply to the hate
So much pain in the struggle my whole body'll ache...come on...
From the gates, so awake that was the plan of my fate
Now I'm straight...got me my OWN knife and fork on my plate
Wanna scorch a debate, wait...do me a favor nigga jus REMEMBER

Cut your shit up, turned around and bumped your head and all

Always remain grand wizard

Askin' who is it
My niggas ain't around, I ain't with it
Ayo, yo yo yo
We here to stay fuck payin' a visit

Let us reach for all things without any resistance
Fatality, for all those in the world that might be mad at me
Suffer in the faces of my immortality

And keep it goin add enough spice, we holdin the recipe

Invested in resorts for the niggas who go and ski

In my fat land with my two nines and my mans
I'mma second from the spot
I cross the street from the parking lot
My trigger finger is hot
I'm seeing Bust in a phone booth
Niggas on the roofs
Spiff Star is in the range
The atmosphere change
Lord's in the forerunner with machine guns, big ones
Now we 'bout to have mad fun
Me and the whole squad meet up
Know shit about to heat up
Wet the whole entire street up
Blast from the car seat-er
My enemies wouldn't even wanna be you
I see you, hunting me down
I knowing that my crew arrive
We gon' see who be the last alive
While we creep all over the place
Looking for space
In case, see him, rinse my whole clip up in his face
As my squad hold they post down
We patiently waiting for them to pass through
Carefully timing the way we put it on their whole crew
Aeiyo, Bust give me the queue
I'm here for you, close to you
Blood in and blood out
We goin' all out, bullets just ringing out
Guns is just spraying out
Yo Bust, hit the dirt layflat
You my nigga to the end I gotcha back
Turn around quick
Oh shit!
He started blasting, grazed me on the hip
Lord Have Mercy dumped five on a nigga
Suck his whole shit, his whole crew busting
Shit ain't going according to plan
Goddamn, my shit jam
Nigga standing right behind me
I think I'm caught up on a creep
I think I need to prayer to Lord, my soul to keep
Dis nigga about to fry my head
My crew burst into a rage
Spliff lifted this nigga, putting two inside his rib cage
Yo, Rampage
Aeiyo, I see them niggas coming, now I'm dumbing
We dead three niggas already the next two we leaving bloody
So much drama over this fucking money
The way this situation end it wasn't even funny
Trying to rob this nigga because I was fucking hungry
But if you try to test let's blast a nigga in a hurry
Me and my squad bounce and left the fucking scene ugly

Things we be doin' for money
Livin' in the street when you're hungry
The way you start to live it ain't funny, no, no
Living day to day but don't live for tomorrow

Palm that, look where the arm's at, nigga need to launch that

To flood these streets, hot not partially, cock back the toast
Put your heart for free, so what it feels like to hear me crushin' a beat

The illest broad Digga, reppin' Brick City
If I'm lying may the Lord come strike my left tittie
(AND HOW YOU DOIN'?)
Undisputed metaphor rap queen, always cookin' up some shit
Like mom's a crack fiend, so what's the word
Strike a nerve when I'm speakin'

Guns get squeezed, and bullets hit your knees

Keep 'em whilin' till somebody's left a leak on the flo'

I pull up in a scratched Lexus with Texas
Tags, so many bricks I cause erections
Lethal injection, electric necklace

Respect, one verse will leave you breathless
I'm rapping on a Biggie beat, they didn't expect it
Fucking with me, expect the unexpected

Analyze the science deeper than when Musa symbolized the devil

Adrenaline rush, heart beat rapid, sweat wet up the floor
Try to threat and wanna battle me nigga
I'ma show you the major difference between a dream and reality nigga
Yo, then I continuously hype up a nation
Huddle with my niggas plan for tomorrow go into isolation
And analyze how many niggas gon lose
Tryin to squeeze they foot up in a pair of great man shoes
And analyze how we was needed to live
Carry out my dooney give the most thanks and be appreciative

Represent and fight to be that everything my seeds want me to be

Chill,Rich Gang: All Stars,UnKnown,"I tried to tell a nigga chill
Call him David, put the mess in the mada Copperfield
For real, niggas know the drill
Mommy on that molly while she pop another pill
For real, tell that bitch to chill
For real, tell that bitch to chill
For real, nigga better chill
And if they don’t, just line em up
It’s perfect timin for the kill

I don’t care about the money that your man make
I hit a homerun, now I’m runnin through my fan base
Up the green from a garden to a landscape
Sounds be the only lingo cops will never translate
They pull up, I pull out that thing and pop it
I ain’t fuckin with no dicks, I’m on that Lorena Bobbitt
I’m no Davie but them ladies say the boys way be Crockett
I’m the plug in the street and you a motherfuckin socket
Had to chill for a while but I’m welcomed back
Was low key, how I’m underneath the welcome mat
Now the bitches see me in the Forbes
So if I give you my number, like a finny you should call
You should tell your man to chill cause you’re fuckin with a dog
And he be firecracker flaming and you fuckin with a ball
I got them crills on the street, got Jahlil on the beat
Only Phantoms, ain’t no Caddys when we roll out in them fleets


Wrist on chill
Neck on chill
Hoes all up in my grill
I cop a feel then I tell that bitch to chill
Hop behind the wheel and get back to chasin that mill
Ok, big black zonin, on shit pumpin
Beef is like a car, to start it I push a button
And it’s over with it’s over with
I don’t know if you noticed it
But I just got my weight up bitch, I’m getting checks and bonuses
Pull up in the covers with, yea I see you lookin
As you should, come and get this wood, yea that getting go
G shot wrist, Reebok kicks
Watch my niggas fuck the place u, King Kong shit
She back and forth on my balls, ping-pong bitch
She playin house with my ding dong, I’m playin ding dong ditch
My bar is too ill, way too trill
Oh that’s yo girl actin up, tell that bitch to chill
For real


Yea, ya’ll know
When I come through and I lock it
So much bread I should attach a laundry basket to my pocket
You ain’t really knowin, ready for the lesson?
See me whippin a Boeing, 7-47
See the wrist be glowin til I’m shinin like a misfit
Spark with nigga cascade, dish washing liquid
Bread up in the palasades, mansion into stash house
Wildin in the club while bitches dancing with they ass out
Mossberg military in case niggas act out
Wildin like a click over traded niggas blacked out
Why oh why oh why nigga?
You don’t wanna try it
See my niggas squeezing til they finger muscle getting tired nigga
Finish with the coke up watch it rattle through the woofa
Like a kid cooked the coke up in a fuckin pressure cooker
Then I quickly count the profit, cop another castle
Keep cooking until they want a nigga on their cooking channel
You know my style, you see the way I sip up
At 10 thousand a bottle, shit you know my niggas grip up
I’m on that raise the throttle shit, you know I got the hook up
Go ahead and fuckin gobble bitch, it’s simple like the pushup
Rocket launcher swag bitch, see how I’m propelling ya’ll
Taking over everything, I’m tired of telling ya’ll

Mix the fire with gas, that's how we put it on smash (smash)
No lie, never deny - so hot we cook the shit well done

What we drop and how we keep shit comin
How we maneuver so fly (fly), so high is where we gon' take it
Controllin the land, controllin the sea
Now we control the whole sky; perhaps make niggas collapse
Make bitches shake they shit to the floor
And feel the soul up in my raps and your face is the gutter we slap
Make you crash all in your whip when you drive
I hope your seatbelt's strapped, aight niggas! Now throw yo' hands up..

Yeah, there ain't nothing iller
Busta Rhymes got another killer
Niggas be gambling, playing Cee Lo
We be getting money at casinos
Gamble my money like gambinos
Scarface look like Al Pacino
Now my pockets got muscles like Lou Ferrigno
Copped the hot shit, big up my nigga Premo
Stack loot with my nigga Dino and Enno (Julio)
Spliff and my other nigga Chico
Uno dos tres quatro cinco (Gimme five)
Count from ten all the way back to zero
Set it off rep. from here to Puerto Rico
Runnin’ the bitches mixed with black and Flilpino
Trick in the hide or on the niko
Caught the round trip to Santo Domingo
My nigga Spliff criminal like Max Remo
Thug think he loud then show me your hero
Nigga tried to play me on the D-Low
Tried to short me a couple gram on a kilo
Thought we didn't know better oh yeah we know
Stepping them niggas for what its gon be yo
Niggas spend money and fuck a free show
Get in with shorty who whip in a little Geo
Derelict niggas get left by the seashore
Lock up a nigga and sabotage the keyhole

Alright y'all (alright)

Yo, guess who coming through for dinner (Who)
Busta Rhymes bringing another winner
Coming with another all night thriller (Yo yo)
Shit bang through your bass kicker
The more hot shit, the more you move quicker
Shit'll make the club crowd a little thicker
Nigga in a club fronting like a killer
You ain't eating my nigga, you lookin thinner
Now you a sinner a partier beginner
You better off if you dance to ""Who Got The Keys To My Bimma""
You a killer but you never pulled a trigger
How that calculate money yo how you figure
Yo, another homerun hitter my nigga
Yo we ain't over hit you with a refiller
We keep it moving never label me a quitter
Flipmode baby you could call me flipper
She wildin we wildin along with her
My nigga put me on told me she a stripper
Fronting like he don't really wanna be with her
He told me handle my business cause he already did her
He says she used to be the seed's babysitter
Fuck a sloppy second hit the highest bidder for realla
Keep the champagne in the chiller
Keep it cold while I hit you with another wig-splitter

I love you, I hate you
Need it like heroin, OOOOOHHHH!)

Baby girl see you the one right
And I love the way you 'preciate my sunlight
Revolve around me how the planets do the Sun like
They compliment the God phenomenally, just right
Hmmm-- in the beginning you were just a cutie
But I love the way your flesh and spirit manifest your beauty
Smile, pretty ass-- bigger than my whole jacuzzi
It's my city, have a seat and let me show the movie
Hmmm-- but I don't like it when you try to fight
Going through the love and hell for shit to turn right
Instead of turnin' LEFT-- that's when the pain stick
See I don't like it when yo ass try to talk shit
You see it's such a problem, when you be actin' moody
Gettin' mad at little shit and hold out on the coochie
Ha- even when I see the wrong sign
Baby girl me love you long time

Baby I don't like you

I love the way you think, I love the way you dream
I love the way you cook, I love the way you clean (I love you)
The way you rep for me, it's hard to doubt ya
I scratch my head thinking all what else I love about ya
So many different things, sometimes you drive me crazy
But what I love the most is how you love me baby (I hate you)
Hmmm- But then again when you be acting psycho
And I don't like it when you get jealous of me, acting spiteful
Emotional and overzealous, got me feeling stifled
See I don't like the way you be black when you be on your cycle
Hmmm- I think about when you be slackin' up
And you could read see how I don't like the way you be actin' up
Ha, Even when I see the wrong sign
Fuck it-- you know me love ya long time

That's why I got you on my side

That's when I put you out my ride

That's why I rep you with the fullest

Hold your man down, show him how you rep to the finish

Hold your girl down, show 'em how you rep when they with us

Lay flat nigga hit the deck, or face big DISrespect
In addition the SHIT we wreck
Firework flow, spit and make a BIG effect
Bang it in the truck until ya whole SHIT eject, c'mon
Stop nigga, close ya shop
SCUD missile launched fire burn quick, every SHIT we drop
From the GROUND with another sound yes we put it down
And always BOOM and pound, so we shut 'em down

To get her frenzied like a motherfuckin rock concert
While you're busy and tryin to FIGURE what the God's worth
I'll malfunction your plans 'til the motherfuckin sound work
Now I'mma CUSS when I BUST ya ass
And leave 'em stiff when I hit 'em like a MUSTARD gas
Steam fire when I puff, then I flick the ash
You wack and I had enough, put your shit in the trash
Now you know we got the shit in the smash
Wild until you slip and you crash, y'know we keep the SHIT in the stash
From the GROUND when we come around, yes we put it down
And always BOOM AND POUND, when we shut 'em down

As we rockin you all to the future

Send a large threat

Turn to macks
And hear how we murdered this track
Do you feel me dogs
Six blocks
Ninety-six buildings
Brick walls
Still push rock
Cause I'm the source

Now nake noise one time for the tight little swinger
Posing in flicks sticking up my middle finger
Everybody trying to get they little shine these days
Make a bitch cold flip back to my grimy ways
Ball in my court, those who lack sport
Tear they ass to the roof without the black thought
Coming on the scene thinking you the Don Juan
Type crimes have you pissing all in your Sean Don

I’m Talking to You,Year of the Dragon,2012.0,"Ladies and gentlemen, are you ready?
Yea
Are you ready to make some noise?
Put your hands together
I want everybody in here to stand up on your feet
Turn my music up
To make some noise
To make some noise
To make some noise
I want everybody in here to stand up on your feet
Aye, where’s Spliff at?
There’s about to be a problem now nigga

Once I captured the soul of the street it’s so hard for me to let go
Respect down at the techno, hear the stadium echo
Now it’s reaching a vile when the weakness is silent
Putting the fear of God in ‘em while I’m shifting the climate
The gladiator presence, everything about me giant
This the year of the dragon with a heart of a lion
Got ‘em throwin’ their swag up, how I come to provide it
Now we makin’ ‘em riot till we makin’ ‘em try it
You can never deny it, how I came to prescribe it
Then bangin’ with the ship like Earth and Jupiter collided
Then I came, I’m remindin’ em, of how the spark ignited ‘em
And conquered continents the size of Asia times five of ‘em
And while I ride for them, you think it’s loud to them?
I give pride to them and get it rough with them
I hate the street that with you, it smell like earth burn
I captivate ‘em with my first words, everybody

(Shout, shout, I’m talking to you)
To make some noise
To make some noise
To make some noise
To make some noise

(Holla!) back to applyin’ the pressure
Bother your corner stretcher, hot like a lot of pepper
Most of you niggas off, cotton and polyester
You know how I know all, legend like Robert Nesta
You know I’m out to get you, take all the robs count
And power to the Billies, couple cigar lounge
See how I make it pop? Knockin’ them all down
Watchin’ them all drown, this how the love sound
Your swag off, you know you really need to look around
And try to find it nigga, searchin’ the lost sound
But I welcome the hate, my mother prayin’ for me
Got too much money to count, my niggas winnin’ for me
Let me appraise you closely
They can’t believe the way we busted up like it’s not the problem is we just playin’ homie
And when we in the spot, there won’t be no delayin’
Only to collect another trophy, now the haters say it for me

(Shout, shout, I’m talking to you)
To make some noise
To make some noise
To make some noise
To make some noise

Ha, uh, uh, uh
What, some more some more
Some more some more, niggas didn't want no more

Now (now) ready for whylin' my niggas
Let's set it like we on the Island my niggas
I'm with it (what what, wha-what what)
Yo, my clique startle bitches
With a remarkable sparkle for my bitches with me (what what, wha-what what)
You know we stay dumb
And keep shop runnin' just the like a 24-hour deli
The way y'all niggas be poppin' that shit you be talkin'
Y'all niggas don't be nothin' but a 24-hour celly
To talk that funny shit to someone you know
While I bag these bitches and take them to 24-hour tellys
Type of chickens to let me get in they belly
Little sexy thug bitches who want me to fuck them to Makaveli
Then get with my niggas and smoke up a ounce
Crowd up in whatever amounts, makin' bitches skip to my bounce
So forever we be shinin' like diamond
Fresher than the fragrance of limon
When we strike it's all in the timin'
Corporate niggas bug on how we be stylin'
Fuckin with huge contracts with wife-beaters on
On the day of the signin'
Makin all my bitches check for this shit
My live niggas know the truth
That's why they always got respect for this shit

Bust one for me, bladow
All my niggas holdin' they guns with me, bladow
And restin' and stackin' they ones with me, bladow
My peeps who hang around where I'm from with me, bladow
Who run with me, bladow
Bust one for me, bladow
My bitches that'll fuck 'til they cum with me, bladow
Whylin they be havin' they fun with me, bladow
In the struggle they be beatin' they drums with me, bladow
In the slums with me, bladow
Bust one for me, bladow

And now we mash y'all, harass y'all
Until the shit we doin' pass y'all
You know we steadily readily give it to niggas
And blow up the spot for niggas before we do the dash y'all
Eh-eh-ey, eh-eh-ey-yo, ain't nothin' wrong 'til we perform
Y'all niggas know we bout to blast y'all (hah!)
Fast me and my niggas crash the party
Hit my niggas with shit and splash bitches before we flash y'all
Now whassup? All of my niggas salute
When we get busy give me my loot, or lay up in a box with a suit
Shit that I tell you will all be the truth
Stay on a live nigga recruit, and take y'all niggas back to the root
Tyin' my laces all up in my boot
All the bitches say that I'm cute, blowin' on it just like a flute
Now now now, before we blind y'all we shine and remind y'all
Shit we got be always one of a kind y'all
We constructin' a new design y'all
Better keep up my niggas because you will get left behind y'all
Let us bust a bottle of wine now
And celebrate in the name of them niggas that control the times now
Now watch it, as we just pick up the pace
You just might a hole in your face
My crew might take a whole of the space
Completely, obligated just to keepin' you dumbin'
And get to breakin' all the shit up in club once you know that we comin'
My bitches check for this shit
My live niggas know the truth
That's why they always got respect for this shit

Bust one for me, bladow
All my niggas holdin' they guns with me, bladow
And restin' and stackin' they ones with me, bladow
My peeps who hang around where I'm from with me, bladow

Whylin they be havin' they fun with me, bladow
In the struggle they be beatin' they drums with me, bladow
In the slums with me, bladow
Bust one for me, bladow

Yeah

"Things We Be Doin’ for Money, Part 1",When Disaster Strikes...,1997.0,"Huh, yeah, fuck that
Niggas go out to get it
Niggas is out there, holding until I see niggas
Niggas is out there holding
Starving nigga, fuck that, I'm a broke nigga
And I gotta see any nigga out here holding something
Fuck that
Everyday, me and my son stay scheming
On how to maximise the level on day to day creaming
While you remain faking
Yo, I ain't tolerating, no mistaking
We on the move to study paper-making
Round up the whole squad quick
Plot the scheme with my niggas, get on some full clip bullshit
Before I solidify manslaughter, my unit form on the streetcorner
We surprise like fiends in disguise
Laying for the right shit so I can receive another grand prize
Greeting niggas like a homeless nigga
The way it happened son, you'd never figure
How the homeless nigga gun is much bigger
Now give me everything you walking with and everything your man is holding
Even the watch that got the platinum moulding
And as the situation start unfolding
You scared to death you little bitch, go ahead
Report it stolen, see what happen...
(Crazy fighting going on, mad punches, smashed glass etc.)
Cocks drwan nigga, holding my dick
Wilding for the night, splurging with my click from the last fit
Open like a motherfucker, itching and ready to do the next stick
Get anybody my nigga take your pick
What you said I said even if it causing bloodshed
We getting paper even if we robbing a fucking chickenhead
Word to mother son, I ain't fronting
I'm taking everything I been always wanting
So I continue to peep out, in the jam will be the most blidded
Rob 'em in the corner bounce to the bar with they money and buy drinks with
It
I stay on some real trife shit, test your life shit or even stab you on some
Knife shit
Fake it if you wanna fake it, if I see it, then I want it, then I take it
Leaving niggas ass naked
Sometime I know it seems so shocking
How you the next victim to be listening of the sounds of a trigger cocking
All in your ears, cold steel all against your face
I feel your blood chilling, your heart racing at a rapid pace
And if you thinking that's strong
I dare you even to flinch wrong, fuck around
You feel the full five long
The victim contemplating what to do
Or how the fuck top get out of the situation that he's going through
This nigga tried to grab the gat, you know I started clapping
Bet y'all niggas wanna know how the rest of the story happened...

Till It’s Gone,It Ain’t Safe No More...,2002.0,"Hey yo, yo
Yo, hey, yo, yo

Hey yo yo

You don't know what you got until it's...
They say you don't know what you got until it's gone
You don't know what you got until it's ..
They say you don't know what you got until it's gone

Hey ya ya yo yo ya ya yo
It was the first sign, on the day of my birth I entered the earth blind
Vulnerable to everythin I would first find
Condition of bein' niggas having the worst mind
Becomin weak like we scavengers of the worst kind
From havin nothin to plot and makin the earth mine, makin the earth mine
That's kinda big aspirations for a nigga thats just kinda got on his first grind
But it's aight cause I'm blowin whole on my first shine
Kinda gas quicker than spaz ready to burst mine
And though it seems like obstacles come at the worst time
Goin from being successful to commitin the worst crimes
So quick like a bitch massagin ya whole dick
And bust a nut, and it's over sabotagin ya own shit
We always good when we get it and then abuse
Then regret it, cause as quick as we get it we fuckin lose it
That's what my mother used to tell me
 (Busta Rhymes)
You don't know what you got until it's...
(See they ain't knowin though)
They say you don't know what you got until it's gone
(That's what my mother used to always tell me)
You don't know what you got until it's..
(Hey yo I peep that they ain't knowin though)
They say you don't know what you got until it's gone
(That's what my mother used to always tell me)

See in a flash they could take it from you like hocus pocus
So count your blessings and baby I hope you stay in focus
Wide awake like I'm drinkin them Capuccino Mochas
Takin on more stress and get to becomin smokers
HA, like the shit they setup just straight provoke us
And fall victim to the shit till it stifle and choke us
I promise you'll find the truth when you done diggin it out
Stop the shiverin nigga I think I just figured it out
You see we thug physically and mentally soft
Kept lyin to yourself, so that your worth and your value is lost
Sometime the feelin of the city is wrong
Why we appreciate 'em all now that 2Pac and Biggie is gone
Somehow I'm seein it clear
I would have rather this value them just as much when both them niggas is here
Yeah, we always good when we get it and then abuse it
Then regret it, cause as quick as we get it we fuckin lose it, listen


Extend your hand for the worried and bless 'em if they need you
Don't ever take life for granted and bite the hand that feeds you
Be cautious how you treat people and how the people feel you
Respect niggas or else the karma is coming to kill you
You got it good baby, just get your shit together
Before you lose it and it's over and gone forever
Dress for the stormy weather
Feel the songs, for everyone is personal like I was just writin myself a letter
A lot of niggas be wilin, callin a name
With disrespect, cashin and blightin, throwin salt in the game
I'm sayin, I'm dealin with logic I hope you ain't thinkin I'm rude
But stop ruin the greatest thing thats been given us food
Clothin and shelter when it's cold we be staying warm
Imagine if they just took the music and rap was gone
We always good when we get it and then abuse it
I won't let it cause it's precious and I ain't ready to lose it, listen

Yeah I though all y'all was goin'
Uh, Yeah, yeah, yeah

You mean now, now, now, yeah
We gonna sail in one of them big fat ocean liners on the street
Swim through this mutha fucka
Busta-Bus now, now, now

Hop scotch I found a new bounce
Just rock back and fourth while my beat knock (Aurgh!)
Stop chips and cock Glocks wit' clips
Go sailing in hot ships and park big whips (oh!)
Getting' them whips and bounce outta town
Take trips ride slow through them hoods and park at the main strip
Baby girl gimme yo hand cock fast (c'mon!)
With a number in your hand, hot ass (hold up!)
Shorty actin' just like she had a hit (on me!)
Fuckin' while shorty's busy shakin' her shit (on me!)
Man stop, just let 'em flop watch girlfriend let alone cock block
Hot shit make a bitch wanna whine just like a reggae tune
Make y'all niggas wanna act and bust the AK boom!
Everyday create a may lay today is pay day mutha fucka you better make way!

It's your night go get your money
Get that dough bounce if ya want
And light that blunt smoke if you got to
Shake yo shit bounce if you have to

Yes yes y'all bounce we go what ya want
All my niggas, all my niggas
All my bitches!

We stay spittin' on
See what we sittin on
Shittin' you see how my 20"" be fittin' on nigga
A 100 dollar bill shorty number was written on
Hittin' shorty on the sink wit' the lights in the kitchen on
C'mon! move quiet with all the DL chicks
Who carry on Lincoln head up on my CL 6
Hit y'all wit' the shit split y'all
Chicks all on my whip hoping ya ass fit y'all
We suppose to reach most shit bang
Watch how niggas bounce in East Coast (Heaighh!)
Choke y'all provoke y'all
Killin' street everytime we distribute the coke all
Check it, see now a days we caught cribs
And caught big fat loss
Fuck big fat bitches that make cliques back off
The way we prove it to y'all
Is just bang niggas every time we do it to y'all

Yeah
Straight black out shit fo show
Making you back yo mack out quick Aiyo (huh)

Ass On Your Shoulders,Genesis,2001.0,"Likes to go, eventual
Lead you home, come inside
Why you got your ass on your shoulders
Now, tryin' to spit at a bitch
I lead inside
Why you got your ass on your shoulders

Yeah bitch put on an outfit, dazzle ya hair
Come in the club fit to take you home and frazzle the hair
Bitch understand I must have got a handle in here
Why you open up ya ass and let me travel in there
Create a scandal in there
Don't talk, let me pull it out to add another angle in there
Let me ride the back of yo ass like a camel in there
Pussy hot like she lit a fuckin' candle in there
Remember I was tryin' to get my drink in the slot
And you was same girl actin' all stinkin' the spot
It was funny how I thought I wasted breath on the broad
A friend couldn't find her cause shorty left with the God
And then I took her back to the crib, you can figure it out
I'm diggin' it out with the dick in her mouth
Get cha' homegirl to come start lickin' ya out
And swingin' about until I start kickin' em' out
Because ya...


I'm sayin' she fuck a nigga like she want the God to lay in a hearse
Makin' me curse, hope you relate to my verse
And what be makin' it worse
That they be the same bitches frontin' like they wasn't with it at first
Actin' too good for niggas with your ass on your shoulders
But now you'll be fuckin' a nigga till he fall in a coma
I remember how you acted in the front of ya friends
As I remember now you give me head in front of my Benz
So now I'm smackin' it up, while you backin' it up
With a car load of bitches now I'm packin' it up
Now ya whole crew comin' and we whackin' em' up
Let me beat the pussy till I start blackin' it up
Got bitches diggin' in my back scratchin' it up
Got em' screamin' shatterin' glass crackin' it up
Get cha' homegirl to come start lickin' ya out
Ass swingin' about till I start kickin' em' out
Because ya...


Sayin' in ya crib gettin' ya shit right sprayin' yourself
With perfume that mean the dude start playin' yourself
Ya too fly to let ya friends know ya lovin' a nigga
So instead ya front like you ain't really fuckin' a nigga
But still I really love to sit on my dough
And there's nothin' I love when ya keep ya shit on the low
Get cha' homegirl to come start lickin' ya out

Yes it's coming back to me

Yes it's coming back to me
(repeat 3X)
The B-U-S-T-A, HEY!!
Salute in sight/site, or get caught in the crossfire
Crush and trip the circuits, my niggas is haywire
For sure corny nigga your time will soon expire
Retire cause your name ain't no longer on the flyer
You abuse your every blessing, go say another pray-er
Still on the first floor, I take you a level higher
Your Miss O'Hara a la sweater smear off your mascara
Can't take the heat, switch to eyeline, yo call Sara
Rhymes penetrate the flesh and effect the bone marrow
Your dry spell flows sound like they stranded in de Sahara
Smoke bombs, salute all my niggas who smoke charms
Let's take it to the garden or fields and smoke out the fat farms
OD'ing on the beat like the needles up in my arm
Then I whip your ass if you do not listen just like your moms
When I count to five, by the time I open my palm
I'ma fuck you up, like the United States got by Vietnam
I go...

Yes it's coming back to me

Rhyme flows cause damage on niggas that's unforgiven
Faggot must be getting dick in the ass yo, how ya livin?
You must been driven two up your ass when you was in prison
Up in the streets frontin like you hardcore, that's done forbidden
Everytime I bomb this be predictions from Nostradamus
Busta Rhymes to fan bombs on your head and that's a promise
The one thing that seems to be funny yet never stated
Is that I been creatin shit niggas think they originatin
My displays make you feel like you need some x-rays
My music make y'all celebrate like important holidays
We got to break fool tactics and carry on with tradition
Whippin in the Tahoe, and we wild in the Exhibition
Wild bend your mindstate, smash your transmission
With no permission, you crossed the line and catch a whippin
Before I wash y'all niggas down like liquid detergent
Watch the flame before I overcook shit, and start the burnin
So, watch me turn it on y'all niggas that try to learn it
Gotta work to earn it, can't come in without a permit
So hot, the wicked shit soundin so official
Little whistles sign with the blast of my SCUD missile
Pass the peas international paper stackin G's
Overseas please you drivin nothin, pass the keys
Get subdued, watch me shoot dope, y'all know my attribute
HUH, make y'all niggas jump with no parachute, like

A Trip Out of Town,Anarchy,2000.0,"I can't wait to make my trip outta town, son
We gon' do it, son
All them bitches, twistin' that tower, word
Ayo, ayo, here's y'all niggas tickets, man
The bus leavin' right now
Ayo, listen to me, man, when y'all get on the bus, y'all niggas don't even sit together
Act like y'all don't know each other, like you're undercover on the motherfuckin' bus or somethin', know what I mean?
When y'all get there, hit the terminal, y'all gon' meet my man Ty gon' pick y'all up, know what I'm sayin'?
Take y'all out to this hustlin' spot we got out there, Newton Park out on Norfolk, you know what I mean?
Most def', most def'
Where the money is proper, the hustle is proper, you know what I mean?
Uh-huh, straight gangsta
Want you to go out there, y'all handle your business, man, you know what I'm sayin'?
Alright
Straight like that, aight?
One love, man
Mon, baby
Okay
Get up with you, man
Call me, call me

Yo, it all began like, bust it
My nigga City bout to bounce on a trip
We met some niggas with a lot of things they want em to flip
I told my nigga get the dough and keep the blau on your hip
Travel safe, you know that I'ma hold it down on the strip
Good lookin', word to mother son I give you my wit
But when I get back, I'ma bounce straight to your crib
On the strength, son slid until you to the Greyhound
Wit a burner in the knapsack, headed straight outta town
Now, three days pass I'm still on the strip
Doin hand to hand with twelve collapsible, stashable clips
With little magnets on the side of the clips we planted like a project
When police come we stick the clips in any metal object
Throwin' a nigga on the walls and try to search me down
I laugh knowin' that my stash'll never be found
Well anyway, on the third day, son came straight to the strip
Wit a new floss and shiny shoes on the whip
My nigga hit me with the latest, greatest
He told me get inside the whip so I can know just what the up to date is
He said he fuckin' wit some Guyanese niggas how ill them niggas is
What kind of dough they get, and how they handle they biz
How they connect with Jamaician niggas who speak American
And how they changed from medallions to iced out pelicans
And how they stay wit four pounders
And speak American to try to blend in
Like they ain't obvious out of towners
Okay, I've never heard of workers gettin' five G's pay
For trips that last for only 2-3 day
How these Guyanese niggas be eatin' pasta but they love zucchini
Rockin valor tennis suits by Sergio Tecchini
Them type of cats that call you because you can't call 'em
Rockin baseball fitters with wild animal skins on 'em
How they rock silks and tailor made pants
And get a matching bally shoe for the silk to step in the dance
Washrags hangin from every one of our back pockets
From every fine wine to champagne them niggas'll straight cop it
And set up shops in them neighborhoods that was residential
Rock laced whips while the workers'll floss the latest rentals
How they fuck with arrogant bitches who act pussy
And love to hustle wit niggas and stash coke up in they pussy
After all of that I wanted ones
The way my nigga was talkin so next trip I went to bounce with son
So now we out of town with Guyanese cats
Up in they gates bubbling packages and layin wit gats
Shit was slow until the main fiend was offed
Just like a thief in the night
And spread the word that we was back with the white

""Ayo why don't you tell that crackhead to close the fuckin door
And shut the fuck up""
""Yeah man and clean the motherfucking spot up, smell like...""
""Break the fuckin breakdown in the working city... yo go get the plates
And the gym star""
""Yo light that up, lemme hit that, gimme a light, yeah man cut that""
""Fuck this shit""

Yeah, see how we blowin' pa
The lookout niggas holdin' fort like they was watchtowers
Buggin' on how we went through, a half a brick every couple of hours
So on and so on, shit is good and we eatin'
First nigga to short a package will catch the most brutal beatin'
The whole town, see we now own it
Carryin' on and blemishing all in the hearts of the best moments
We stackin' cheddar now and shit is all clear
And we was growin' as workin' niggas wit aspiring ideas
We love to floss and the feeling of pushing chrome shit
But in the grand scheme these niggas'll love to have they own shit
Now these niggas was really ready to swell up
We decided to separate from them niggas and make our shit develop
Off in to the wilderness of the wicked Husid
We set up shops and watched the games begin
So now we ballin' like a motherfucker, money was sick
Gas on the cheddar and these bitches ridin the dick
Fuckin everything from the local McDonald's bitches with the biggest ass
To attorney bitches that'll beat a charge fast
We used to takin niggas' custies and leave they set up on tilt
And watch 'em angrily scheme on the shit that we built
Ain't it funny how shit transpire in fact
Not too long after our ride we took the winner's stash, house was at
Some niggas tried to run a jook with things in they palm
Not a problem so immediately reach for the john
Right away the gun, bust straight lifted a nigga
How we moved his organs with kickback, shifted a nigga
Wild shots fire, everybody scatter like rats
Leavin nothing but gunpowder and a trail of smoke in these gats
Now we got this faggot nigga blood on our hands
But fuck it, determined to fulfill the best of these plans
Shit was hot but we was nowhere near ready to fall
My son said he shot, but he wasn't bleeding at all
Word, I started buggin' when my nigga said he feel cold
Then I looked up on the right side of his shirt and found a little hole
So as we continue to radically blaze the fifth
Flame the iron, not giving a fuck, y'all niggas wanna rip?
Well we deaded three out of the four niggas who tried to jook
One nigga slid and think he got off the hook
Now let me find out one out of them three niggas we bodied
Was one of them Guyanese niggas who buy drinks up for the party
He was the nigga to flood the table with champagnes
Stupid motherfucker tried to front, we had to leak his brain
Suddenly my nigga fell to the floor
And said his legs feel like them shits ain't got no feelins no more
More the actin' up the more the shit I felt in my gut
The shit was all over as soon as the director said cut

That's a wrap, good actin' motherfuckers, good actin
That's the shit I'm talkin' about
Y'all ready to watch the playback?
Fuck around, that shit'll be a box office smash motherfuckers

I got whatever I signed
You wanna hop in, bitch come and go
Just have to have your mouth wide
If you know that you plan on coming on
On for what you..
And if you think we’re gonna stop
That’s just absurd
My middle finger’s in the sky
Screamin’ fuck a hater til the day a nigga die

Yea, I got ‘em yellin’ “Oh God, Lord”
Presence fresh, Gillette razor sharp, Tom Ford
Fuck G4s, I charter private Concords
And shoot through the sky like missiles when they dodge ball
Toast them bottles with the booze
Smell and stink like old money buried in the king’s tomb
When you think we smell funny, certain niggas wanna watch ‘em
When it comes to money I’m a rose fragrance, watch the flower blossom
When it comes to bread, y’all niggas know it’s me
I articulate beautiful like a poetry
Hoes bring me that paper just like they owing threes
Triple my revenue, God bless my rosaries
Listen , that’s why your witness and your highness
We’re celebratin’ success and sippin’ on the finest
Most you motherfuckers need to learn to stand behind us
When we come and dismantle you niggas quick and leave you spineless
But that’s for you to digest

She see me stackin’ cheese in my satin sheets
Silver SLR, smokin’ lavender leaf
Yellow Jesus piece, I still feed the streets
I’m getting skull, that Ferrari seats
Riders at the top, get arrogant on ‘em
Sit above the law, you can rat if you wanna
My money mandatory, slip you a deposit slip
Money green, Maserati with a body kit
Dead presidents, got my name on the blim
Fast in the residence based on a tip
Playin innocent, the state attorney want a grip
I’ve got enough, get with puff, I could make a flip
Fuck the charts, time for me to top the Forbes list
I’m a fat boy, but I’m on that Porsche shit

Hand on my heart while giving thanks and continued bustin’ these bottles open
Passin’ the time, securin’ lanes, gurkin’ forgot smokin’
Controllin’ every room when I enter there start toastin’
Undecided on what to drive, think the garage is open
As we do the impossible
It seems successfully manifestin’ a thought and livin’ out the dream
Leave an unforgettable mark of mud
Documented like adding a chapter to the Bible with my blood, listen
Every day is like a weekend
Like we never give a fuck, celebratin’ for no reason
A convoy full of trucks, ain’t no question, we all eatin’
Then it’s silence when I talk like I’m hearin’ the Lord speakin’ now
Yeah, as they complain about my ways
Cuz I’ll be grindin’, never sleepin’ just be ballin’ on for days
Be fuckin’ every model, and be weedin' out the strays

Lightworks,NBA 2K8 Soundtrack,2013.0,"This is Bendix, the tomorrow people (Today)
What is the magic that makes one’s eyes
Sparkle and gleam, light up the skies
The name of the game is lightworks
(J Dilla, Kweli, Q-Tip, ayo, ayo, ayo, ayo, ayo)

Blast from the past, yo, I’m back from the get go
Let’s go, let’s go, rap is special
Ya’ll dudes gas like snaps on the petro
Flashy, like the gun blast in the ghetto
Sparkling like fireworks when we light up the sky
We independent like the 4th of July. Why?
We ask a question that you forced to reply to
Shine through the night, through the orange, sky blue
Rhyme for survival, 
Like Big Jay or Skyzoo, fly with the haikus
A pro with the pro’s, still worse with the verse
Dispersin’ the hurt to rappers gotta work with the nurse
Made it through first thank Q-Tip for taking a verse
See how they all up in my mug like they takin’ a purse
Now that’s hard, like the population of Rikers
This here easy, it’s lightwork

The shine effect sparkle and gleam
Light up the skies
The name of the game is lightworks
Light up the spliffs
The name of the game is lightworks

Dilla still in here, Kweli he still in here
Abstract on the track for filming fulfillment’s here
Watch ya back, boys, there’s culture vultures everywhere
Walking the calm streets thinking that theirs peace in there
Draow, they blind sided up in they creepin’ in
After the rush I’m drinking ice quarter waters to sustain
For the long haul advice is a order
My vertical up that no way on the way back
Competition, I eat that I’ll get sneaker contract
I’ll mary a vixon, she’ll come with the tricks and
She’ll take all my mansions and all of my riches
And leave me with the flatscreen and my new game device
And my little black book, my boys and my brand new life
Now I’m playing on my TV screen
Beating niggas down looking Bruce Banner green
Lookin’ at the high score, do you want more?

The shine effect sparkle and gleam
Light up the skies
The name of the game is lightworks
Light up the spliffs
The name of the game is lightworks

Check, niggas say my flow is bananas
Yes, flow’s sicker then another nigga
Looking up another man’s ass
Yes, you can have the mayonaise
Bust your head and bang bitches
Up they cope and cabanas
And leave with yo bitch
My niggas will lay you out on a canvas
My clique consists of red and blue flags
We full of bandanas
Thorough like desperados, Antonio Banderas
My D crash floors, diamonds, them shits
As clear as a sunny day not a cloud in a sky
My nigga, whereas, yours look like
“Da da da, skippity boop” period
I’m so serious, flows makin hoes delirious
You wanna find out?
Bitch jump on my dick if you curious
J Dilla the godfather of the funk dubious
While you niggas think you the cell
I be the cell nucleus
You’s the stupidest
If you think that you can ever contest the kid
Get outta here with ya groupie ass

Shoot For the Moon,Back on My B.S.,2009,"As we go way beyond sky's the limit, and you know who we are
We shootin for the moon and land on the starrrrrrrrrrrrrs
Let us land on the stars, let us land on the stars
Let us land on the stars
We 'bout to do it real big like outta this world and we takin it far
Shootin for the moon and land on the starrrrrrrrrrrrrs
Let us land on the stars, let us land on the stars
Let us land on the stars, let us

Now don't you think this shit's outrageous?
At this point if you don't see I'm one of the greatest
I play the long time up in the league with the majors
In every history book they add a couple more pages
Like - about the way I take 'em through stages
On different levels, peep the way it read on the gauges
Regardless I'mma love 'em, I don't care how they hate us
No matter how they try, see they could never replace us
Like - mommy always said beware of the dangers
Embrace genuine love, be careful of strangers
Cause when you are the best they try to weaken and change us
They don't recognize at first but always do when you're famous
Like - I live my life bold and courageous
And invest my time and always calculatin my wages
And let me lead the march, they'll probably start to parade us
Because you know that I'm comin to SAVE US


I spread my wings takin off properly
I laugh at muh'fuckers that'll think they can top me
I laugh harder cause somebody said that they dropped me
When I'm flyin through the sky now how the hell they gon' stop me
Like - most of the time it's good to be patient
Now I'm back with the crack, sorry for keepin you waitin
Prepare the food right for the street and season the steak and
Grab a champagne glass and put it up, we celebratin
Like - and tell me who you tryin to race with (who?)
If you ain't notice nigga I be ridin a spaceship
I'm light years ahead and way beyond all the fake shit
I gotta stay away from trash because I probably'll break shit
Like - I know it's kinda hard to believe this (why?)
The way I always come back and return with the heat bitch
This shit ain't a secret, son it's hard to defeat this
Risin out the ashes, flyin like a PHOENIX


See now you see I'm back in the zone, B
And it feels good to be home with Sylvia Rhone see
Back to smash on the planet, niggas know I'm the only
One to be back with the authentic to smash all the phonies
Like - we mostly do the thing that you can't teach
And then send 'em a rhyme into that bullshit you can't reach
Then I give you shit that make the hood wanna bang in the street
And state my word is bond, I live out what I SPEAK nigga!",https://genius.com/Busta-rhymes-shoot-for-the-moon-lyrics
Don’t Believe ’Em,Back on My B.S.,2009.0,"When they tell you that you'll never get over (ha ha ha)
Just tell 'em they're number one (el capitan partner)
You're a champion (yeah, the Ali of my day, you know me)
Don't believe 'em when they try to say it's over!
(I can't hear ya, I'm way up here, what you say?)
Just tell 'em they're number one (it's over for who, numero uno partner)
You're a champion (ha ha ha, let's go Bust!)

Now, there's, nothing you can do to stop a nigga from within
With the hunger of a lion I secure another win (hey!)
So passionate, you might even misinterpret it as arrogant
I'm going in (hey!)
I'mma make the world feel my pain
While I'm showing you my muscle and I hustle through the game
And even though they leave us in the hood like we ain't SHIT
We ain't got nothing but everything to gain
Look, even if a motherfucker try to pop me
I'm so blessed - do anything that you could do to stop me (Stop me)
Now I'm climbing up the ladder and I'm jumping at the top
You might wanna call me - Rocky
See there's more of us - Ugly
You don't really wanna war with us - Trust me
So glorious, that we from the bottom
Still we victorious - Hug me

I see it in your eyes, it ain't hard to tell
They're watching you (can't nobody ever stop what I'm doing)
They just telling you lies, they want you to fail
They're plotting on you (and they can never stop my movement!)
So, don't believe 'em when they try to say it's over
(You know exactly what to tell 'em!)
Just tell 'em they're number one (number one)
You're a champion!

Hey, see the websites lying trying to block my shine
Don't you know you never will stop my grind?
In a drop-top flying like I don't got time
Got everybody surprised that I won't drop dimes
What's on yo' mind? Best get me off it
At least quit lying if you must keep talking
Go on with the nonsense, best keep walking
Boy how you sue us, send the lawyers to the office
A lot of y'all got sprung like that shorty
Couple months off, I'll be right back shorty
With a brand new swag and a brand new .40
And a brand new ride, give a damn who saw it
Nation-wide news, nigga yeah you saw it
Shorty need a bodyguard for his bodyguard, don't he?
Tip falling off sound kinda odd, don't it?
Y'all hate to see me ball? Take it up with God homie


Any situation where you might get fed up
Gotta stay focused, homie keep your head up
It don't really matter what the next one is doing
Homie gotta handle your business and then you better step up
Live to the fullest for the dream you're pursuing
Ain't nothing in the work gon' really stop what you're doing (Oh!)
Go hard no matter what they be saying
Nigga don't quit cause you know we gotta keep it moving (Oh!)
Take a look and see yourself in me
Cause it's all about we (We)
Me and you securing a win together
So we could be the best that we could ever be (Oh!)
Stay up on your grind, be the first one to - Set it
People try to shut me down, I won't - Let it
I'm so stubborn for the success
You know my motto, don't stop, get it, get it!

Love Y'all niggas man
Watch what i do when honoring y'all name
Streets feel me!

I'm nice with the lead peel your edges like slices of bread
Precise, become a poltergeist, stickin knives inside of your head
What's the issue, on a roll, like a roll of toilet tissue(?)
I continue to expose you niggas that's so superficial
I script you your obituary then blow like a missile
Once i blow the whistle, motherfuck may the forces be with you
Come with a style, im wildin', pile up my money so kosher
Then call up the sofa fuckin' bitches in back of the rover
Then bounce with the coca, bag up bitches outside of the Costa Rica area level, my features and carry my posters
Unprecedented, i cemented, you changing your flow up
While helping you grow up, niggas know you for sounding so tore up
Challenging niggas, better hold on to your bannister niggas
Fuck around i'll stuff your body parts into cannisters niggas
Like you don't know the half, i'll bust your motherfuckin ass
Busta buss, cass, and papoose is fuckin psychopaths

Making Niggas Wanna Get Hype Yo I'm PSYCHO 

My nigga beside me with triggers and niggas get bodied
I lock a strip and chop a brick like im Mr. Miyagi
But this ain't karate, i been sick since i pissed in a potty
I probably been proper since my papa put dick in my mommy
I'm a cannon man
Holdin' the hammer man
For the loot niggas shoot niggas like a camera man
Snappin' a picture, you get stuck like the back of a sticker
I got bars like the factory manufacturing snickers
And i do crimes for the bread like croutons
With two nines i be layin' clowns down like futon's
With the bullets in the rocket, my pocket's is full of cream
I'm blowin' steam, keep the steel in my hands like wolverine
Poppin' the metal, you niggas is not on my level
I'm locking the kettle man, i'm hot like a pot and a kettle
On the mic i spaz, who get as hype as cass
And my nigga busta, we some muthafucking psychopath's

Making Niggas Wanna Get Hype Yo I'm PSYCHO 

I'm an iceberg trapped in a fire i won't melt
I'm a fetus that survived an abortion, i won't be killed
I'm the heart of Brooklyn, New York, I'm Bedstuy
I'm a christian woman's hand on the bible i won't lie
I'm the code of silence in the Gotti crew
I'm an empty mag right after a shootout, i just bodied you
Got something sup? shotgun pump, shot at you
Like kamakaze through, your baby mom's feel the wop cock back
Cause she was sittin' on my lap
I stay with the oowop strap
I put your baby daddy in a body bag
When i squeeze and let the wop clap
I Baghdad(Bag That) like Iraq
This is my era, you niggas is losers
I'm the new era(error) like a mistake on your computer
Got the infrared dot, bustin' you gullible suckers too
Put a dot on your ass like www

Though some of us have been poisoned
Many of us have been blessed
And through the worst shit
That we all as people go through
Every blessing that we are blessed to have
Are blessings that provide us with what makes us capable of withstanding
And makes us more powerful when we go through the worst shit
Everything and every motherfucker gets dealt with accordingly
Mark my words
See I remember on The Coming album
You know when there was only five years left
It was once said that there was no time
To take time for granted
Well we are now face to face with that very given time
There's only one year left motherfuckers
1999
The dawn of the new millennium
I understand though
Sometimes it takes time
And hands-on extreme hardship experience
To realize how much better it is to prepare for the worst
By all means
It will always be better to be safe than to be sorry
So as we finally approach the year 2000
Behold what it might have in store for us people
There have been many indications of changes
That will occur, that has already occurred
That were not and will not be set up to our benefit, as people
But in order for us to continue to build
We must destroy
And unfortunately in the process
Many of us will be liable candidates
Of being destroyed
But in the bigger scheme of things we must defend
What we all collectively identify with as the truth
And with what is right
To all my live soldiers
And all my live women
Those who may not survive the turning point
May you forever rest peacefully
As you are delivered back to the essence
So I dedicate this burial song to all of you
To my survival of the most fit for real niggas
And women no doubt
Continue to get what's yours from out this fucker
Before your time run out
And may the force of survival forever rest with y'all
My live motherfuckers
To all my survivalists
See you in the next thousand year period
Allah bless all y'all
Flipmode continue to bounce
Like a satellite in orbit
Seein' all you motherfuckers at every angle

Stay tuned
See y'all motherfuckers, January 1st 2000

Leave you lookin' out a place
Like youse a tourist on some foreigner shit
I be that nigga and I love to experiment
With specific high-explosives
Just to take y'all niggas out of this element, now

'Cause we got new shit for y'all
All my niggas in the spots, y'all know we tear the shit down and how we hold it nigga
And we come to take shit over y'all
Yes, we here to regulate and put our foot down, the shop is closin' nigga
Always rep the street for all y'all
Constantly hittin' y'all off with street shit and keep y'all niggas open, yeah
All my niggas, all my bitches, whatcha all gon' do now?
Every time we come with that street shit

Hah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, we move like stonefaced cold-hearted niggas
Baldfaced straight retarded niggas
Ayo the shit we do be so off the hook
Fuck around and get yo' leg broke
And beat all in yo' face with ya foot
We here to stay, fuck payin' a visit
I only fuck with certain live niggas
Like my niggas Tash and Xzibit
Ever since I vowed to keep the shit raw
I stay hittin' niggas with shit
That'll leave they fuckin face on the floor
Everytime niggas know when we black
Smack a nigga so fuckin hard
He'll fall and probably spin on his back
Funny how niggas'll always shit talk
The very next day they will notice the difference
In the way they bitch walk
My street niggas need to come for the ride
Cause when we step up in the place
You funny niggas need to slide to the side
I love to watch these funny niggas diminish
And while we slowly murder them niggas
They prayin' on the moment we finish
I take you back to the very beginnin'
And beat you in yo' head from birth
And watch you grow lovin' the shit we be bringin'
Street niggas keep they mind on they dream
Focus the most on gettin' they paper
And be thoroughly reppin' they team
You know we quick to mash it down for some hours
Quick to leave some of these niggas shook
Runnin with the rest of them cowards
And leave the rest of niggas ready to dumb
And rep the street until we all die
Could give a fuck wherever you from, now

'Cause we got new shit for y'all
All my niggas in the spots, y'all know we tear the shit down and how we hold it nigga
And we come to take shit over y'all
Yes, we here to regulate and put our foot down, the shop is closin' nigga
Always rep the street for all y'all
Constantly hittin' y'all off with street shit and keep y'all niggas open, yeah
All my niggas, all my bitches, whatcha all gon' do now?
Every time we come with that street shit

For all my motherfuckers
That live in the urban city areas
Only the urban city areas
The ghettos
The neighborhoods where they got, delis, liquor stores
And churches right across the streets from all of that
Yeah
Motherfuckers sellin' weed, crack, and all of that shit
On the corner, it ain't the right thing to do
But niggas is put in the motherfuckin' livin' conditions
That have to do that shit
The street motherfuckers
All y'all survival of the fittest motherfuckers, survive
This is dedicated to y'all

To provide us all with that bass
Especially after you finish cookin' that bass
I always been a hungry nigga
The type to set a whole entire country into a frenzy hold up
Whatever niggas wanna do, niggas wanna try
Fuck it, I'm better than the best of them
King Kong and Godzilla mixed up together
While I'm blessing them
It's wrong for niggas to mix us together
Cus I'm better than every fucking body
You should remember that I never been lesser
Always fresher I'm upgrade and bitch constantly mutilating foes
And outshining their favorite
Probably boost the ratings while I'm changing and rearranging the climate
I'm the fucking pilot
Silence, I'm so amazing and so spectacular
The way I sparkle like fireworks then I cause a massacre
And make you feel how the fire hurts
See the dungeon dragon has returned RAWRRR, look
Then I come one after the other then BLAOWW, before the hook
Then I see how the people's amazed and astonished by what I do
Cause I see how the heater just blaze and I tarnish up other dudes
Then I see what I feed to make niggas just WOWW when I'm coming through
Indeed I plant a seed that'll make 'em DROWNN when they get the news
That yes I am the best and unless you could replace
Cause I only deal with facts and the truth is in your face
I got bass (coke)
Every line is (dope)

This should be soundin' like a thousand mosquitoes buzzing like hmhmmmhmmhmhmhm
I got you niggas buggin' like fucking zombies is coming
And dumbing and losing it
Got a fucking army that's gunnin' and running for rulership
I'm in a fucking party with something that's stunning' and cute as shit
I don't play with none of you dummies
Who the fuck is you foolin' with
Then I count and sum up my money
Niggas know how I do this shit
Then I bounce and I run through the country
Then I come with a slew of hits that'll massacre the planet
Obliviating the earth
And diabolically smashing everything for whatever it's worth
It's Busta Rhymes godfather beast boy emperor
This rap shit coming to get the bread
Gimmie my cash, quick so that I can be malice
You niggas now running telling do it
So I can reblanket the town with the epidemic
I got a flow that cause cancers
Better call up the paramedics
And it'll complicate blood circulation in diabetics
A lot of hateful niggas try to put my pockets on diuretics
But NAHH we don't allow them things
You and your mans can get it as you complicate the flow

Unstoppable, yo, Maino!
Ran up in Atlantic, told 'em let me go
Smack my A&R and grabbed him by his throat
Playin with my life'll get you yellow-taped
Runnin in and out of church like I'm the yellow Ma$e
All-black fleet like when Obama get in
Missiles aimed at yo' building like Osama livin
""Fuck 'em all"" is what I'm screamin from that Mase' seat

Think deep, feel the pain in my homie's face
And only then you'll understand why my homies bang
Strapped up, this is us, fuck a deal nigga
Gun boys be like ""Maino is a real nigga""

Handcuffed to the bus, we the same thugs
Never fear, just know that I'mma ride for ya
All black baby welcome to my mafia

Handlin those that be plottin on takin it from me
Some of these niggas forgot I be makin it funny
We're spendin like my fingers rotten then papercut bloody
In case you ain't knowin we back dominatin the country
Until I make these niggas black with the strength of a monkey
Balenciaga boss, bitch address me as Mister
Eat salmons and tortellini down at the Bella Vista
We move in silence bitch you better whisper
And sizzle the street with the heat until it hella blister
So much bottles, got 'em for every drinker
So much head I be callin mami a heavy thinker
Victorious like a nigga conquered another nation
Buyin bottles and drinkin to drown the sufferation
Could give a fuck about your plan, watch how I handle that
If it ain't YMCMB or Conglomerate, cancel that!

So inspirin when a nigga doubt
Look around and see how niggas try to count me out
Only if niggas stepped in my shoes and took a walk
And thought of shit I sacrificed I wouldn't have to talk
And I'm like a bitch's blouse on a clothesline
And treatin how I stumbled on another goldmine

Well Busta Rhymes
It's been a long time since you've had a good talking to
And the last time I gave you my blessing
I told ya, you was gonna encounter a lot of niggas and bitches
Tryin' to get into your shit
Well, you've come a long ways
Since me, the bad ass Dolemite paid you a visit
And even up to this point
You ain't seen shit yet
From what I understand
You done built you a brand new home
So this time around
Before you welcome these motherfuckers in yo shit
Make sure they know the rules
Rule Number 1:
Busta Rhymes is your name
And breaking motherfuckers down
Is your game
Rule Number 2:
As you continue to give it to 'em raw
Before they come into your house
Make sure they wipe they feet
At the motherfuckin door
Rule Number 3:
Before these niggas misconceive you as a pranksta
Make sure these motherfuckers respect your gangsta
Now moving right along
As you enter this new place in your growth
Like I told you before:
Keep slappin' dick in the mouth of these bitches
That don't wanna act right
And put a hot one in any motherfucker
That tries to get in the way of this power move shit right here

Or when the team circle the block, busy trailin my clique
Truck packed fulla niggas with the strap and the whip
Get the gat out of the stash, put it back on my hip
Gat butt you in the face, split and fatten your lip
Blood hit the floor louder than the clap when it drip
I credit your name with bullets, read the back of the script
My victim's initials engraved on the back of the clip
Chicks love the way we roll, how the movement is thick
So official like my name's on the back of your bitch
Pay triple for the name on the back of the stitch
Name like the whole city now I'm changin the pitch
Kick back kinda crazy when I'm holdin the fifth
Think you nicer than the God, shit is only a myth
Grab ahold of the masses, I was born with a gift
Niggas be runnin they trap, throw 'em over the cliff
Thinkin and drinkin the Guinness, busy holdin the spliff
Flippin and shittin on niggas 'til we old and we stiff

A rare Louis collection, pushin a brown Coupe
Paint job sick like a bitch leakin out brown douche

My money speak a different language, Lebonese on 'em
And turn it up another two thousand degrees on 'em

And drown cities when I give you that tsunami music
And watch my HOOD niggas spaz, peep the way I do it

Quenchin' they thirst to see you, knowin' they hurt they need you
Sharing my pain through these words, hopin' to connect with people
Providing space where theres space of mind while we conquer evil
Visit a place where you see the sign and can spark the cerebral
Sick with the truth when I'm in the booth like I caught the beazles
What I let off is lethal, lets set it off and eat-together
Bless the possess the signs that come before me
I wrote this couple days after they took Chris Lighty from me
Still in denial but put up your cellie's and lighters only
And rep your love like the greatest pain when you lose your homie
Despite ya try to hide it, look how ya try to fight it
There's no possible words, you can find to describe it
You would've enlightened a lot of lives that would make us mighty
Your still at light, no coincidence your last name is Lighty

This could be the first trumpet, might as well be the last:
Many more will have to suffer
Many more will have to die - don't ask me why
Things are not the way they used to be
I won't tell no lie;
One and all have to face reality

And since your gone I'll face it and stare it the eyeball
Back is against the white wall, the sun is setting
My spirit gets darker when the night falls
Still in denial when my phone be ringin' and I hope you might call
Seein' ya smile when you know we winning
Steppin' through the right doors
Glorious moments with you, nothing we couldn't get through
Still question what you were feeling before that bullet hit you
I called when it supposedly happened but couldn't get through
Questionin' those who were there and exactly what did they do
Painful, my tears are fallin', Master at problem solving
A man of god so I know you here when there's trumpets callin'

So many questions remain unanswered, it’s so exhausting
The harsh realities of another precious life that’s lost and
You never fell under any pressure, they couldn’t stop you
I’m sad you’re gone but I’m happy to know that God got you
So much I’ve learned from you bro, I’mma rep you til the end
You rest in power and peace until we meet again
So much I’ve learned from you bro, I’mma rep you til the end
You rest in power and peace until we meet again

If you listen carefully now you will hear:
There’s a natural mystic blowing through the air
Such a natural mystic blowing through the air
There’s a natural mystic blowing through the air
Such a natural mystic blowing through the air
Such a natural mystic blowing through the air
Such a natural mystic blowing through the air",https://genius.com/Busta-rhymes-chris-lighty-lyrics

With bitches shakin' they ass
And dancin' just like they fuckin'

A couple cribs
And a little company doin' construction

When you bowl win the goal bitches scream
Win the goal keep ahead keep it live
Before you go get your tattoo rhymes
For your boy pick a bell in the bathroom
Penalized doing it till he get tired of ya boy
That shit between me and you niggas
Then trying to figure out what I say
I give less than a fuck, what you doing over there

Hear my records feel my presence now and forever and until
Stop what you doing and work it fuck it nice
Just complete it with a licking to the man right there
Tell you motherfuckers what we came to do
It's just plain as day but they don't wanna see
If you don't wanna fight get the fuck is you'll be
In the spot working on my beat
Long time I'm having no compromise
Ima open them up and them I'm dumping them out
I'm keeping it hard so don't get mad
Cause I'm loading 'em up and I'm running 'em out
Hit 'em with the bang then I feel a bang
Take her in the backyard outside leave 'em in a ring
Teach the niggas not to fuck with us
And next year we gon do the same thing and

Now who you is nigga?

Me and my nigga Mystikal make a plan that generate
Sufficient amount of funds across many lands
Generate the heat the place radiate
When I break shit I drop create a earthquake
Yo, anyway we still double masking
And get the gambit and eat super pie niggas
All over the track with a kick in your back

It's Flipmode baby, yea, come on
We bout to cause a riot nigga

Got a lot of niggas rollin' with ya holla
Cause you know we ripped it hotter than them other niggas
Spot a nigga gettin dollars not another nigga
Can do it the way that we cocked and shot another nigga
Think he deserved the way he was boppin with a cherry copper
Glitter blood fella send a cop to get 'em
It's funny the way the iron just to drop you quicker
Why I hit y'all with the fire, think I got a winner
Stackin a crib with a chick that make a proper dinner
Black in the range with tint, and chrome aqua spinnin'
Parked right next to the Benz with a soap opera and the TV
Up in the dash co-starrin a opera singer
That be the type of bullshit I be on and stay hot
I stop whippin' a Bentley to whip a Mercedes Maeboch
And keep runnin' around the street like my name was Mel Patch nigga
Come through your hood and take your whole block, come on
And while we give it to ya

Never been done before you motherfuckers
Tanks and armored trucks bitches
Don't get it fucked up
Don't even look at me diagonally
You better look at me straight up and down
Six o'clock bitch, check it out now

First and foremost I'm only here to knock shit down
And push ya shit back and completely lock shit down
And make sure niggas know how to act
The way we blaze shit, imagine if we really had to resort to the gat

Yeah, we treat niggas like audiences just clap em' down
Well fuck what happened before this what's happenin' now
For you niggas who hate, really can't stand for this
Break both ya legs, now ya can't really stand for shit

You motherfuckers thought the game was the same
Now a days niggas in the hood got dabs to shoot down a plane
We bloody niggas so quick and so fast
Instead of givin' niggas that gat I prefer to put a foot in they ass

I got something for them dudes who be tryin' to be too hard
A street sweeper and I ain't talkin' about kind that can move ya car
I'm a bad dude (Oh yeah, I'm really talkin' about bad)
I'm a big ol' problem (And he ain't really talkin' about math)

To all my thugs in the street puttin' it down with us, come on
My real live soldiers puttin' it down with us, come on
My street corner colonels, uh, get down with us, come on
My dogs who hold they post down is down with us, where you at
Now all my people in the East is down with us, come on
My hustlers in the West is down with us, come on
My Dirty South gangstas, yeah, is down with us, come on
And forever keepin' it gully, ya know it's a must
I'm number one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one
One, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one
I'm number one

I know I'm the one, I'm supposed to win it
No type showin' lots of chips but they mostly twenties
Lots of Cris, mostly bottles
Lots of chicks, mostly models
Lots of bullets solid but they mostly hollow
Ya ain't gotta say nothin' nigga for me to dump off
Here my nuts can say right hear it's the jump off
I'm in the car, smoked when I drive, tear the roof of the coupe off
Me jump in the club, make em' tear the roof off


To all my cats who think they thuggin' only doin' it wrong
The church bell rings only to play ya funeral song
You wack nigga throw them lyrics away
Before I turn ya to a ghost make angels carry ya spirit away
Even though my broad be holdin' a snub
A bottle of Cris can end up becomin' the worst weapon inside a club
The way we beat you with and the way we come with such brute force
This how we party and next time me and my whole crew floss
The new boss of this old shit
Before ya move me probably there's a million dudes ya have to go get
So Busta-Bus be makin' em' run
Under studio, every level I say it with conviction
I'm number one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one
One, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one

How Much We Grew,Anarchy,2000.0,"Yeah, this next joint right here
Is dedicated to all my niggas that I love
All the niggas that held it down with me through the whole shit
From the beginning of the fort, to the now current day of the fort
From the beginning and the birth of this whole shit
To the now success of this whole shit
And all my peoples that be holdin' it down for their peoples
Ridin with them through thick and thin, love y'all niggas
Peep it

1, 2
Every time I sit and take a look at how we grew so much my niggas
1, 2
All the things I do, you know I will hold my flags for you my niggas
1, 2
Every time I sit and take a look at how we grew so much my niggas
1, 2
All the things I do, you know I will hold my flags for you my niggas

Now, this how the shit all started
Was like doctors of  I was being conceived kinda retarded
Like, and while my moms was conceiving this beautiful baby
Doctors was the this woman's stress out of this Jamaican lady
Pops beef and straight carrying on
Nobody realizing how the god was now being born
Ayo, yo, 1, 2
While they was wildin' and shit
They couldn't even find my pulse, sonogram on the frisk
So, they tried a natural birth, but had to stop production
Baby stuck all up in the womb, another malfunction
1, 2
And now the doctors discover
They had to cut this lady's gut, and c-section me out of my mother
Pop duke could only sit and ask why
Looked up in the sky and begged for mercy from the most high
C'mon, now, 1, 2
See now the day would feel blessed
Watching the birth of a precious baby life manifest
See how that bugged me out

1, 2 (That shit, that type shit be buggin me out 'cause)
Every time I sit and take a look at how we grew so much my niggas (Y'know niggas, nigga look back)
1, 2 (To them days when you know shit is kinda ill like y'knawmean?)
All the things I do, you know I will hold my flags for you my niggas (Nigga, niggas like fall out, y'knawmean?)
1, 2
Every time I sit and take a look at how we grew so much my niggas (Motherfuckers is, niggas live long enough to look back and shit and)
1, 2
All the things I do, you know I will hold my flags for you my niggas (Laugh and shit, y'knawmean?)

Young and learnin' shit that started is thick
Started inquiring a lot, started using my dick
Like I knew it all but I wasn't really knowin' and shit
Buggin when my pubic hairs started growin' and shit
Now hold up, a young nigga now a couple years pass
Searchin desperate to experience my first piece of ass
Now, gettin' into mischief and caught my first arrest
Started smoking weed and started totin' on them cigarettes
Eyes bloodshot like I was starin' at a highbeam
Nigga only twelve so why he lookin' like he nineteen?
1, 2
The fast life baby, young with an old soul
From the past life baby
A young nigga wanted things and wanted money quick
Ambitious on the Amtrak, with a quarter brick
My nigga, 1, 2
It got hot in the streets
My nigga campaign the cops who started walkin' the beat, my nigga
Trouble causin' too much problems just me and my brother
Made mommy a grandma and shacked up with my babymother
Now it a seed, I was always ready to clap shit
Strugglin', so then I start fuckin 'round with this rap shit
Moved to Long Island and got up with a few niggas
Believin we could show the world we was the 
Leaders Of the New niggas
A crew of niggas that was hot like an infirmary
Blazin' 'til they started actin' like bitches internally
So now, Flipmode is how we own it fo' sho
Tried to fuck with niggas but I couldn't do it no more
Fo rilla, 1, 2
And then I got with some niggas
Always wit it to multiply the gross and double the figgas
And then I, hit with bombs and hold a stack in my palms
Whippin' Bentleys, floss icy shit and take care of moms
Give the local little old man a job as my chaeuffeur
Hold it down for all my niggas til the movement is over
It's kinda beautiful

1, 2 (Yeah, y'knawmean?)
Every time I sit and take a look at how we grew so much my niggas (How we have acquired so much)
1, 2 (Where we can look back and, and actually laugh and lavish)
All the things I do, you know I will hold my flags for you my niggas (In the, in the, in the moment)
1, 2 (As we prime in life)
Every time I sit and take a look at how we grew so much my niggas (Look at how we, we struggled all this way and went through the bullshit)
1, 2 (Motherfuckin', little obstacles)
All the things I do, you know I will hold my flags for you my niggas (Situations they try to set up for niggas to fuckin' fall off)
1, 2 (And lose they hard earned shit, y'knowmean?)
Every time I sit and take a look at how we grew so much my  niggas (I holds it down for my niggas though)
1, 2 (Give my last to my niggas)
All the things I do, you know I will hold my flags for you my niggas (All the niggas that was wit me through the whole shit)
1, 2 (Love y'all niggas, word)
Every time I sit and take a look at how we grew so much my niggas (Love y'all niggas, word)

Go ahead and suck that dick but never chew
No need to leave your girls out, you could bring em too
Ass bouncing on a nigga like a kangaroo
From One Oak to Green House, 01 Avenue
Fuck them til they in a coma and they got a clue
Smelling the pussy aroma, what you tryina prove?
Maxi van soldier in the fountain blue
Still spreadin money from my deal with Mountain Dew

If you try to go against me nigga
I put you and yo career under 6 feet nigga

This is for my mob and my thug niggas
Ruff ryder bug niggas, Def Jam website violate the club niggas
Screaming what, what niggas, yall a bunch of but niggas
Always want figures but never play the cut niggas
Talk mad shit but never put up niggas
Is it cause I bust wit stuff that just shut up niggas
Flow like dro, I pull then clip it or mix it wit some moet then sip it
Then turn around and flip it, shit on your whole album wit a snippet
Run up on your lawyer for your contract then rip it
Shame on your label, for trying to let you eat at my seat
When they know I call my name at this table
I'm gon always be here, and yall always gonna fear
The bronx making them records cause we always prepared
Got sons you don't know about, ones you don't know about
Buns by the tons, mad guns and we going out
What!!

It ain't over, It ain't over, ain't over

I'm the one wit the chrome and the clothes
Drop flows from the dome , wit the ice got the price of a home and a lobe
SONJA BLAD-E, just so you know baby (yeah)
Hold eighty roll through you and your old lady
How rich this dough made me, gold az matching the navie
Shit you won't find at old navy, two hundred zero ad
Still live shit, spit to divide cliques on some wise guy shit
Same chick from the ?, pretty eyes lips, thighs hips everything five and six
Height five six, jeans five six, benz green five and six keep me five or sixed
We know dice hit want cream fold, for two green five six seelo and the ego (yeah)
So how you flipping grams yo (uh uh)
I'm touching keys like pianos to getting dough like Tony Soprano

Yo my niggas is on the same level I'm on
You ask me why I'm Melvin Flynt I'm doing a porn
Ay yo yall niggas is faker then a three dollar bill
And I don't shoot to bust yo I shoot to kill
What's going on yo, the jump off and jump off flow
Yo I'm in five O, O, O, yo pass that hoe
After you get done wit it, yo let me hit it
Bitches know how I come, I bring the cock wit it
All of the thug piece you know I gotta rock wit it
I ear plane the hoe like I cockpitted
Yo I love my niggas, don't love no chicks
I like to light the blunts then order my licks
Foundation motherfucker like the bottom of bricks
I'm from Iraq nigga wit dominican hits
Puerto Rican motherfuckers yo yall fake they fits
Violator motherfucker

Yo, yo
I told these niggas from the giddy up
Yall give me sixteen yo I'll tear this whole city up
And niggas don't believe then tell em put fifty up
All bets is down, all my thugs do dirt, all our tecs spit rounds
My ? playas disrespected clowns
Bringing guns, weed and coke to connected towns
See I pop niggas like corn, and real killers do killings wit the lights on
I knock em out, cause I don't like to fight long
Remember me lefty gun up in my right palm
It's Mysonne, see Mysonne is the one that knock on your door
You open up, you see a whore wit the Glock to your jaw
See Mysonne is the one that hit the blocks wit the raw
For his money, Mysonne air the block wit the four
Yall cowards don't want war, yall can't stand pain
Cop you some gators, drink champane
Cause when it comes to the street shit, I let the heat lift
Murder scene police lines nigga white sheet shit
Yall roll wit niggas, I'm the one they roll wit
Yall go get niggas, I'm the one they go get
Yall niggas don't want nothing to do wit me
Cause I spit guns and rhymes like their's two of me
Motherfucker

Niggas can't be serious, we wear guns like clothes
But only show em when it's time to blow em in bulk
We been through way worse then war, razor fights and more
Left niggas wit leaks, holes and wide jaw
Be the quiet storm, appear how you wanna scale bar
Check out your weight, see if it's worth to war
We did the street life y'all niggas just got involved
My appetite for guns is similar to carnivores
Dislike me you head on, fight me you dead wrong
Cause now a days you only get wet wit my dead on
Don't let this song push you, the fourth hit you
Have you keyed up gasping for breath on the floor cripple
Infamous we take it to the extremes my words
Especially when a nigga mistake me for herb
Get buried over words, I'm loose wit the dessy bird
I can show ready or tell, yall niggas heard

Now gitty up now, it's lighting horseback saddling
Rob beaches like we rowing a boat and we paddling
Down a stream of water, wet any nigga challenging
Blow one all in your knee cap leave you staggering
Scrambling cause theirs a whole lot of shit we be handling
My hands all in the money, Fuck it we dibble and dabbling
Got you imagining how this could really all be happening
My landscape of live niggas stretch from here to Maryland
BLAW put one in a nigga who be rambling
And blow a hundred thou if yall niggas is really gambling
Gritty niggas feel the snap pop leaving it crackling
You know the bouncer keep all of my live niggas wild wit him
Traveling to see niggas from Howard through Grambling
Ha round up my niggas to form a large gathering
Yo rattling niggas who walk badlimp
Beat you in the same place till the blues start blacking
C-E-O niggas stay general managing
FLIPMODE throwing those heavy bundles we carrying
Yo analyze my many live niggas cramming it
We throw a three pointer, while yall niggas throwing javelins
Sweating your whole shit, feel your clothes dampeing
Dancing in a line of four wheel drives we lamping
The ? arms length up in the draw paneling
Or unraveling the truth on how niggas remain champions

Hot to death with shit that always keep you jumping
And rush the dance hall

And hit y'all niggas with flavor
Nothing less than the best y'all

Break fool and black out
Hit you with some shit

Crazy,Year of the Dragon,2012.0,"Ayy! 

I know you love the way I come and I scorch this
Ain't nothing changed niggas know I'm holding the torch, bitch
Excessive with the heat see how I'm holding the fort, sick
I'll twist a nigga's shit just like a fucking contortionist
It's bang bully bust rhymes, I'm coming to squash shit
Demolish every hood, disintegrating the mosh pit
Spaz, animal rap, they love when the god spit
I know you wish you could the way I bang them regardless
It's the Conglomerate in case I ain't mention
There's bitches in this building and they all in this section
To dominate this shit has been my every intention
These niggas think they sick I come and kill the infection
And when I come through you know I'm blowing the top off
The building and the club you niggas know how I pop off
And if you violate you'll probably get your shit chopped off
The way I got police barricading the block off

Sometimes I act like I do because of this voice in my head
(voice in my head, voice in my head)
It tell me just what to do to spend a chunk of this bread
(chunk of this bread, chunk of this bread)
You make them niggas want to say
(them niggas crazy than a motherfucker)
Them niggas psycho how they ball
(them niggas crazy than a motherfucker)
They buying all the alcohol
(them niggas crazy than a motherfucker)
Like they just buying out the mall
(them niggas crazy than a motherfucker)

Before I finish counting this bundle
So kindly as I welcome niggas (back to the jungle)
I'm back to run this, bitch, I strive to keeping it humble
I'm here to shake the building 'till it crackle and crumble
So back out bitch, see how we knocking the most hard
I'm about to split the ocean, get to calling the Coast Guard
Better call the ambulance, I'm coming to choke y'all
I'm smashing every country, bitch I'll send you a postcard
See now they acting like they ain't knowing
But I know you see exactly where the bottles is going
A couple box loads see all the money we spending
We drink until we stupid and the party is ending
Now peep the way we coming in we picking shit back up
The tunnel two thousand twelve the way the shit packed up
We full throttle in this bitch and never will slack up
While I feed you the heat watch how my niggas will act up

That’s when I take a moment and look
And see just how the light is shinin on me
See how we takin off
No matter how you try to stop it
See you can never take this from me
See somethin that you never knew is that i, cut from a different cloth

See im different from most of you niggas how I was bred
All the way down in the DNA and the blood that I shed
Down to shit I value and the love that I spread
Then I realize our perspective is different from what I see in my head
Nowadays niggas get caught in the web
Posin and frontin until you step to em and they regret what the said
Its funny how niggas that gamble with they life til they get hit up with led
Examples is triflin I look em instead I continue my focus gettin my bread
Tell me where the fuck is your manners at lil’ niggas
I swallow niggas like yall, fall on niggas like yall
Don’t know what ur doin but im sorry for niggas like yall
Look, why you wonderin why im sayin what im sayin
Maybe if you would listen you smart, you probably realize I ain't dissin
Just distinguish the difference how it conditions see I was conditioned
To be that nigga to create a plan and instated
Yall been conditioned to study and follow the plan I created
Identify me as one of the greatest

Wait! (wait wait wait) hold on! Let me continue to get you to the to grow on
Being that most of you lack the ability to make hits or so on
Guess whos back the powerful impact
Soon as I drop people wanna go run out in the streets and get dat
And run right back to they truck and bust off the rappers sick from how I spit dat
So appreciate it now people made it this thing I do seem like its the greatest
From a thought that was created successfully forced through all of the hatred
By givin you that special music that bring the heart of the now and the sequal
The soul of the hood and the votes of the people
The streets be the range and my bran while I struggle to keep a balance and equal
By givin yall bangers that everybody gon' love
We gotta master this, just had to captivate him and make him throw up
Niggas rilin from stadiums to low clubs
See when I come and make my return I school you niggas
Obtaining that information you need to come and just study my statements

Rough Around The Edges,UnKnown,2006.0,"God I know I've done got away with a lot
I've been keeping account
Figured I'd holla at you for my blessings 
Before I kneel down and a choir would sing
A sprinkle holy water on me, Please I need your help with some things
It's mostly complicated lord, I got me sick in the head
I conversate with people who died like I speak with the dead
Laying down with chicks with no feelings, it's like I sleep with the dead
I fed a lot of people poison, now I eat with the dead
Forgive me for the nega-tive
Things I do and things that I said in order
Take it for granted that my words are being recorded
Cheat, lie, deceit, sold drugs and fucked my mistress
Forgive me for the company I kept and murders I witnessed
Thus I never stole a switch and always stayed of my grind
The older folks would try and talk to me and I pay 'em no mind
The old timers, they used to say the devil is coming to get you
Stay on that path, better hope that god is walking it with you
I hope you listening and your hearing my clear
I strive to never say your name in vain
Or ever beg for mercy in fear
Every money option minimal for feeding my fam
Just tryna secure the food, minus the blood on my hands
A couple youngin' follow what we do
The shit is astounding
You can see the wicked in they eye and know the devils' around them
Until it's time, I wait for your arrival
Stick with survival and continue to walk with your blessings
My gun, and my Bible
Hope you forgive me lord


Mossberg on me, up early
Now what's the verdict?
Perspiring, paranoid, peak from curtains
Hearing voices, church lady gave me holy water
Plus some stuff to smear ointments
All over the skin, I hear it over again
Voices blow in the wind
Telling me foes is coming for revenge
Giving me choices, there that voice goes again
No applause, no air time
No need for the floss or ""I don't care"" rhyme
No studio session needed to air mines
Here lies a dude who did it
I'm a fool at the pulpit
My jewelry dripping
My uzi slipping
I interrupt his eulogy
Excuse me y'all--sipping
Something to soothe me
Talk about my dude, I miss him
Father's a pimp, his mom a Christian
Laying there shivering, what's his religion?
The choir's a liar, songs they singing are repulsive
Preacher man tell it how it was, it went

Now that explains why in each ward you avoiding me nigga
Knowing now it takes nothing to be destroying a nigga
Conditioned with a mind to shit on your brother
Flossing with jewelry and whips just like a dick and still live with your mother
Copping shit that superceded your salary
Where is your loyalty to your own blood and taking care of your family
Funny how you sit and drink what you drink
Thinking the foulest shit and not even knowing why you think how you think
Must be the reason why we aren't aware
Because the devil know how guilty and filthy he is in all his affairs
Fucking with my mind when I was a youngster
Cause he know if we knew the truth we'd make his ass run from amongst us
That's why we thinking that it's better to ball
While the devil be sitting and watching plotting how to murder us all
Now this


Hey yo
That's why I'm hustling harder
Now I'm in a huddle seeing the struggle in my mother and father
That's why my persona will come with such a karma to be getting this paper
Cause I ain't with the slavery labor
A lot of niggas in the hood probly relate to me greater
Than those that believe when they die they going to meet the creator that's crazy
How we become slaves
To mental death and power that comes with becoming even more of a dumber ass
The devil robbing you blind
Concealing the truth from niggas while we be struggling they murder the mind
The wickedness sneak on you quicker when they creep from behind
Continue to speak the truth 'til it weaken your spine
Now check it
The jewel I give you be the beat the beat for the time
You can't see it like you living on a street for the blind
Young whitty hustler niggas that stick with the grind
Fly cuisine food poisoned cause you eatin' the swine
I stay struggling and doin' for delf
Then I dig in my body deeper and do a little knowledge of self
They wonder why they catch a nigga on the weed sell
Better be careful what you saying on them e-mails
Now listen
They got your mind in a prison
You can do whatever you want but focus if you desire to listen

Using our soulfully bodies as we abuse the beat
Move your feet and lose your seat happily, not unusually
Leaders are atomically boomin', exploding stupidly
Brothers working out open arms, rejoicing jubilantly
Every move I see y'all approve, it's all so cool to me
Now that I openly express my potency
I hope that you all stay acquainted like you supposed to be
Vocally I flows in each moment to show I openly
Ready for the world to rejoice, peacefully, hopefully
I'm normally known as the D-I-N-C-O, only me
But different yet from the first time of even knowin' me
We grow in scene to grow in size, fitting appropriately
What, you thought you wouldn't reshape and grow urgently?
Life's on the line, every minute in time, certainly
The next best thing than this money is our currency

Yeah, as Dinco D would say, ""I see""
I hope y'all niggas see this shit, too

Skylines evoke fly rhymes to kick like a habit
Never quit, got saliva to spit, it's automatic
Emphatic, no static, love the fabric
Irresistible to all like they all gotta have it
The outcome for suckers is worse than tragic
Gorgeous with the group, it don't get more graphic
As sharp as a knife, I'll take a stab at it
Whippin' the track, I'm terrific in traffic
In a class by myself just like Mr. Magic
Poetry performs to pop off at the pageant
LONS, yes, the flavor is erratic
Current like recent, it's all mathematic
Keeping it tight, it's a soulful tactic
Locked in a rubber room as if prophylactic
Craftin' and creatin' the new up in the attic
Reaching for the stars, now you know that we're galactic

LONS, it's only been 19 years since we've been back in the studio together
Y'all shouldn't be scared, y'all niggas should be frightened

See y'all niggas can hang your fucking plans up, make you niggas stand up
Hands up (Hands up), hands up (Hands up)
News clips, yes I give you new shit, you flip
Cruise ships, new whips, sailing from the tropics
See we back from vacationin', take 'em in
Let 'em all decide while I break and bend, if you with me then come on
Never the one to front on, run on
Special Ed. program in this bitch, niggas getting they dumb on
Then we blacken the spots till they turn the lights in the club on
I come to eat your food and get my grub on
Blood up on the dance floor (Yup), somebody got a cut
Beefin' in the club while niggas drink until they vomit up
VIPin' with a bunch of bitches while we chop it up
Security pick 'em up, buss boy, you mop it up
Back to counting this money with my niggas, it's nothin' though
If you ain't know it, now you know

It's Busta Rhymes and I'm back with the crack and the thugs and the drugs
A nigga's black, oh, the best to do it, we only deal with the facts, bitch
Blazing that I'm so amazing on the tracks, bitch, bounce of them
And I jump and I skip and I hop and I flip over niggers' like gymnastics, hey
Watch the way and I'm giving the streets acid, bastards
Niggers' know I'm the king of the classics, drastic measures
I'm spreading like a rash bitch, class is in session
Uou're about to get your ass kicked, emperor of every round table of the house
And when I speak, niggers' respect me as leader of the councilman
God rap, God persona, God scrilla, God body in the flesh, call me Godzilla
Now you know, you see we be the most prominent, dominant niggers'
Respect my conglomerate

Young Money's in charge, yes, it´s Lil' Wayne but the moneys enlarged
Priorities, Young Money and God
Now they want to know how I be getting money on Mars
Because I'd be getting paid like out of this world, hip hop is a bitch
And I´m proud of this girl, when the sharks come, see how the fish curl
This is my game, you gon' need a referral, I know more about tree than squirrel
Me no talk much but the heat so verbal, brand New Marc Jacobs
Pink coat's thermal, gun's outside of the gear external, I´m so fly
Ya´ll still at the terminal, I´ll put you in the dirt
Just because I see the worm in you, Dirty South, bitch, admire
And acknowledge it and respect my conglomerate

I tell them, 'Hold up, swoll' up, you ain't see us rollin up'
See them broads froze up, soon door's open up, hey, ladies
You're liking what you see, American gangster, my strap's European
Came wit a scope, got a Navy feel so I can ambush niggas like the Navy Seals
My defensive line lookin like some linebackers, most six cars
The other half's car jackers, ballers' with them things, yeah
We call them contractors and if you're in boys right
Then they might contract you, forty cal's looking sweet
On them honeycomb seats, just like Cassie, my Sean John's freak
Get you what you want, just not that deep, yet, thirteen will split
Got them A Rod seats, two for the Madonna, the A Rod freak
You know I've brought the whole so we're A Rod deep

Race track horses, big meetings at the round table to discuss what the cost is

Gangsters', varmints, ice garments, don shit, real niggers' who I get it on with
When I'm around, my colleagues ain't comfortable
They've all got a sick with my verses for a month or two
Wrong nigga to have a problem with, the blade first
Then the bullet gon' follow it, if you're lucky, I might hollow it

Big Bun B, but you already knew that
Live from the state where they chop it and screw that
You hatin' on the trill OG, where they do that? (for real!)
Motherfuckers need to get off the dick, man
Fall the fuck back like a bike with no kickstand
Get out my mix man, just go' get you stuck
Deeper in the quicksand, with no easy fix, man (damn!)
No tricks, man, those is for kids
Cushion, my cigar, and hoes in the crib
Drank, and the twenty ounce froze in the fridge
You fuckin' with DA so you know what it is
I'm sittin' on the fours that clack
Comin' down candy in the golden 'Lac
We gettin' to the money like it's Goldman Sachs
And we do it for the pimps that are holding back let's go!
Look who crept in with automatic weapons
Reppin' QB till the death of him
That nigga that inspired lyrical tyrants like Kanye West and Em'
Track record goes back to ""The Essence""
Smack adolescents who ask who the best is
I'm nasty like gas from a fat man, attested
I pass it, you gaspin' for breath and you die fast
But I'm like a gastric bypass
Bunch of Nas African actors seemed to get typecast in the same role
Since sixteen I ain't grow a day old yet my brain grow
Cocaine white Range Rov'
Tats on my body like an art exhibit
I did real good for a project nigga
Was once a Bacardi sipper, now it's Chandon
Fat blunts in the car with strippers
Guns in compartments hidden
I was real young, little youth, a novice nigga
Blessings, bowed down, respected
Chowed down now my food's digested
Pow pow, with my shooters are Techs
Bust louder than the noise I just spit
Let's get one thing straight that my crown ain't for testin' testin'
Chop heads off like King Henry the eighth, guillotine to ya neck, bitch!
I'm a king in this thing, don't be dumb
Been in this shit since ninety one
Niggas can't fuck with the style I use
Your fate is sealed, no Heidi Klum
Calm now, was a wylin' dude, studied cowards that made power moves
Watched Wild Planet seen lions devour food
You can say that's how I move
A monster nigga, and I don't really like doing songs with niggas
There go my nigga Wayne, let them niggas hate
I love my nigga Drake say ""we ain't got time to respond to niggas""
I'm a villain, I'm a villain, all that happens in the street
Poverty and desperation made me everything I be
I'm a shotta, when I pop up with them poppers burn ya block up
Call the judges, call the coppers, we takin' over Gotham
Word to Poppa
Blood gang, five! It's that Blood gang, five
But green is the bottom line
I run this town, I ain't gon' lie
They run they mouth, they ain't gon' fight
They actin' like they ain't gon' die
Until I let them llamas fly
Flatbush to Bed-do-or-die
From Watts to Larry Hoover Chi
Poverty and heroine, it's no place for a juvenile
Put greed in our heart, it's the green that we want
Cash Money is the company and Weezy the boss!
They say I'm underrated, but un-compete-with-able
Understandable, being that my rating levels are unreachable
Anything said other than that should be silenced, unspeakable!
And the thought of you being nicer than me, unfeasible!
They ask is what I do ever gonna stop, this shit will never end
That's when you hear a car crash in the vocal booth got 'em sayin'
""There he goes again!""
See now they nominated a nigga to come and flatten everything
Now let me dominate it, nigga run
And they be knowin' that I be blackin' on everything
And make it complicated like a nigga constipated with a gun
I gotta make it what they want and wake 'em when I come and shake 'em
And bake 'em and take 'em to another place
Ain't no fakin', ain't no kind of mistakin' how I be breakin' up
Everything and be creating a s-s-s-situation when I'm done (Damn!)
You see I spit National Treasure, discography rich
And I done killed more cats than curiosity, snitch!
Most of you niggas sorry and owe apologies, quick
What the fuck you niggas still hangin' around here for
You apostrophe bitch?
OK, now enough of that, see now I'm out the door

Busta Rhymes and Greg Nice we never fa-il
(You won't te-ll, I won't te-ll)
My shit stay fresh never ever ever stale
(You won't te-ll, I won't te-ll)
Foot shock to your ass just like the third ra-il

Snitches get stitches when they go to ja-il

Sometimes I feel like Bobby's World
Rocked the mic, before jheri curl
Single, mingle, no main girl
On the low, like Secret Squirrel
Uhh! It's time to Patti Duke
So shake whatcha mamma gave ya like Luke
It's Greg N-I always down to juice
Too much Hennesey make ya puke
Now I bust on indo dreams
Uhh, I don't be fuckin with keys
Rock the shell-top, or pin-striped Lee's
I could write a song make a hundred G's
You went back to high school, nuthin but a tease
Know I got stones, call me Mr. Please Please
Walkin down the street wit yo'
Box in your hand... hot damn!
I never drove a Lex dog, never drove a Land
Or a Testarossa, rather puff L's
And I sip on mimosa, bedroom wall
Homegirl have my poster, I'm not surprised
That's the way it's supposed to, makes ya hot
Much hotter than a toaster, style elevates
Like a roller coaster
Chorus

Yo, the greatest unsolved mystery
Of how I rotate your chicken golden rotissiere
Freak the cheesecake flow from here to Sicily
You really need to get offa my, hickory-dickory
The main attraction, even freaks the close caption
Snap break a piece off, a little small fraction
I still fulfill your dissatisfaction
I'm in the process, of completing a transaction
Huh, Carnegie Hall, like a opera singer nigga
Still doin the yes y'all, uhh!
Today we bust guns in the future we bustin lasers
Out of range in case you tried to reach me through my pager
I'm bout to blaze ya, with the flows that will amaze ya
Hot to death nigga, call me Smokin Joe Frazier
Seal up the box and present the closed casket
Busta Rhymes got the boombastic fruit basket
Bend your ass back, stretch you like elastic
More drastic when I be feelin fantastic, uhh!
Caught the chills stack the large bills barbeque on the grill
Me and my niggas grant wills
Niggas talkin shit but they ain't got no skills
Lookin like they full of shit your niggas named you no frills
Don't let me catch you takin for granted
When my lyrical cause will leave y'all niggas stranded
Distributed by, Warner Elektra and Atlantic
Niggas thought they could fly, but really crash landed
Hah, when I'm in the place I'm up in your house
All y'all corny motherfuckers need to shut your mouth!

I hunger the coming attraction
And they gonna keep going til I yell cut

Suffocate your shine, vacuum
Why most niggas still wanna hate?
I’m digging in they bitch in the bathroom
OK, slime, tell em everytime
Y’all already know what the flash do
When the diamond gleam and I never flick up on it

With the biggest followin' the nigga slackin a nun
Able to move a mountain of niggas havin then sprung
Just check out my women but how be havin then strung ass though

Keep them whilin' then ten minutes later then it's sawed off
Create a small spark then down to the levels to make the walls stark

Oh man, oh Lord oh bitch mercy
See the way we got em all thirsty
Bitch come and ride with me on this journey
Come and stride along my beef jerky
I’mma make it sweat the more we get dirty
Bitch had a perm but now her shit curly
It’s Young Money right here, it’s the conglomerate right here
See all this bread that I’mma peel off when I get to buyin everything up in here
Shit getting hot and getting all humid
Poppin that molly and actin all stupid
When they aks who the nicest is in the circle
Don't be mad cuz your name ain’t included
If you need water my flow be like fluids
See the way we be comin, intruded and booted
When I finish with 'em I leave em all wounded
Bitch you ain’t know where level, 5 mutants
See how this shit is really going, acting like they ain’t knowing
Gotta a nigga really digging in they pocket
Every time I ask, they open and closing
Look I hope you know what the fuck, what this shit is
When I dig in your stuff, makin you curse me
Go ahead and angle the pussy a whole ‘nother way
I ain’t got no worries biatch

Hopin' you niggas is ready for another free fall
Overall niggas need to get up off the wall
If they wanna brawl Missy give me a call
Yo, not at all everytime I raid the rift
Before we bust yo' ass better plead the 5th
Shut your mouth you niggas talk to much in my house
Me and Missy lets get this money thats what I'm talkin about
Then you come nigga wanna be down
Shootin' your load I hope you know we got the rebound
Real quick break fool know we blow your mind
Off the hook nigga fix your telephone line
When we come through tell me what you gonna do
Give me my money quick so then I can thank you

Keep the pockets bulky like the muscles on Conan, swollen

Cry (Make the whole world cry!)
Hands up (Now, put your motherfucking hands up!)
C'mon! Feel my pain and make the whole world CRY!
Stand up (Stand up, my niggas! Listen!)

Behold one of the greatest
Every time I touch microphones, I conspire to kill you, like Bilderberg or the Skull and Bones
Illuminati and all of the secret societies
Listen while I speak and organize all my priorities
Take a look at the environment, shit's looking strange
And how the living condition for a lot of people been chaingin'
The way we been so obsessed and possessed to just talk crime
It's funny how niggas ain't dropped a jewel in a long time
Dig in your law, find, Stop acting like y'all blind
They put it in our face, but y'all ain't reading between the lines
I don't need a psychiatrist, I'm focusing, fuck a shrink
We take so much shit for granted, shit is deeper than what we think
Certain people thing I'm wrong and probably think that I'm off, maybe
Because when we talk like this, they make us look like we fuckin' crazy
But that's alright, if you keep listening, it might clear your sight
And your vision and you'll start thinking 'Hey, what if this nigga's right?'
They  all my being, never needing permission
They control us through our own hustle and through our religion
The attention span is short, that's the way we conditioned
See, that control is what's having us lose control of our children
Some things I never understand, no matter how hard I try
If I behave and go to heaven and see God when I die
While they always used to tell me that 
When no one came back from death to say if it was truth or was lies
Thus, I always strive for perfection, I might make a wrong step
I think 'What type of person could create such a concept?'
Them extending the powers that people go is tremendous
They'll even use all of the faith that we have for God right against us
Same mu'fukas got us thinking 'We're all equal'
No we're not, they try to put the fear of God in my people!
There's no NEED to fear God, look in the mirror and see
I have been blessed, so I'm POSITIVE that God loves me!
Tried to oppress us and kill us and treat us like we they trash
'Casue I'm god-like, so they put they fear of God right back in they ass
To strive to conquer our inner demons, trying to stop the war within
The Devil always been trying to confuse us 'bout our origin
Sitting, thinking 'bout shit I've always pondered ever since realizing I'm somebody's nigga
Courtesy  , that's why we tripping and falling and covering our face too
Not even knowing where my blood even trace back to
But I always give in to  and misleaders
Is it cause my blood might trace to possibly being a descendant of Jesus?
I know who they fear the most! I hope you're listening clear!
The truth is I'm god-like and our nature is different from theirs
I hope the praying that I do sometime will serve in this purpose
I pray at home because I feel I'm running out of places to worship
When I used to go to church in the name of God as a 
And leave they kids in church to finally getting fucked by the preacher

Me and Busta keep it tight like liposucion
Niggas that don't like me get the knife for frontin'
Cause one night in the club gets your life on crutches
You got that whodie, I'll cock that forty
Flyin' in the 5 with the top back on it 			
Stop that shorty, I know you love me
Probably sample one of my beats then owe me money
Plus you don't know me money, so stop the rumors
Before you need the janitors to come mop the room up
Ryde or Die Volume two, smash the charts
Now put your hands in the air for the black Mozart, OH!
Chorus:  Busta Rhymes
(Ohhhh), Now come on
(Screeeam), Jump baby come on
Get your hands up, (What!), now all my ladies do it
Get your hands up, (What!)

Busta Rhymes:
Y'all niggas try to front, I'll send my crew on a hunt
Bunch of scheming ass niggas smoking gats and blunts
Busta Rhymes, Flipmode represent
For the Ruff Ryder, and my nigga Swizz
And we gonna be here to present
Y'all niggas with some other shit to bang in the street
And block the fuck out, bang the fuckin' floor with your feet
Before we bang y'all niggas all with the heat
Feed y'all niggas more gutters like a mutherfuckin' all you can eat
And make you bounce how poncho will play the congo
And bang on the bongo, free to bounce on the bongo
From New York to Colorado, so just follow
I'm living for today and livin' tomorrow
Open up your mouth, I got somethin' big for you to swallow
Blow you through the chest with a hollow
Like the foul shit you waste and transpired right infront the impalo
Yo, the general Busta Busta shock and memorable 				
You know we precious like minerals, and deadly like burials
Chorus
Swizz Beats:
Listen, Flipmode and Ruff Ryders bang out hits
S-W-I two Z's bang out clips
Bang out chicks, for fun we bang out whips
Y'all go to war with revolvers that bang out flicks
Now find me on two-fifth in the summer when it starts			
And iced up, nice cut, new pair of Jordans
Thinkin' of extortin, nigga your life ain't important
Your camp hotter than ours?, the fuck y'all snortin'
My thugs bang out bricks, swing, mix, throw dem grams
Hash smokers, hopin' more and out of soda cans		
(Yo Swizz, I heard you stole), Whoa! listen man
Mindin' my business will make you a missin' man
See the wrist and hand?, got plaques on the wall
And a fifth in hand, I'll put your back on the wall
Nigga don't ask me no more about nuttin' you hear
Just scream and shout and just wild in here
Chorus: 3x
New York, they ain't ready for it
A-T-L, they ain't ready for it
Oh, Oh, Oh, they ain't ready for it
Whoa, Oh, Oh, they ain't ready for it

King Tut ready, to the curb, lil' nigga
I hope you listenin' to every word, lil' nigga
Full course comin', this the hors d'oeuvre, lil' nigga
Three-kilo gold Cuban on my neck, homie
Three dice roll Cee-Lo when I bet only
All gold uniform like my name Kobe
All gold unicorn pendent on my trophy
World champ of this whole shit, niggas know me
So much gold niggas bitches call me Goldie
Did so much for the game, niggas owe me
For the co-sign I'm the one you gotta go see
Before you niggas try to approach me
Just know I'm in the corner, kinda busy where the hoes be
I'm the coke layin' under where they nose be
You the joke, niggas laughing at you low key
Now get to know the way the bro live
Derek Lam gold frames up on my nose bridge
Gold Ace bottles fillin' up my whole fridge
Showcase models, nails, toes did
Solid gold, kid

How the f*ck can you hate, ungh
When I'm just doin' my thing? Aye!
What other nigga you know, write pop songs, rap and make base? None
I am original, these other rappers sound typical
I got it locked in the figure-four
And they could never see me, I'm invisible
And I got...
Gold chain on my frame with the gold Jesus
Whole bank in my jeans I'm a gold Visa
Gold bling in my ring like a Saints helmet
Gold rappers on my dick then your girl pelvis
F*ck, boy... we don't f*ck with no broke dudes
My jewelry game is bicoastal
And my piece is on my stomach like soul food
Your homie snitchin', he so fool
Over bread I'm a show him what the toast do
Seein' lines in HD like Pro Tools
Then hit the Hamptons and throw on my boat shoes
Cruise the Atlantic, stoppin' out in Trinidad
Make a movie, turn a island into Cinemax

آروم به راست) هی، آروم باش مرد
آروم به چپ) هی، آروم باش مرد
آروم به راست) هی، آروم باش مرد
آروم به چپ) بی خیال، کنترل خودتون رو از دست بدین!

خدای من، تابوت رو پایین تر بیار
خاکستر رو بپاش، تو باعث میشی شکست بخوری، پاو!
وقتی به تاج و تختت بی احترامی می کنم ناراحت شو، از شهر برو
همه چیز با خاک یکسان میشه
من باعث میشم بگن واو؟ جر می خوره، اَو، باو!
من اسلحه همراهمه، کلیک، پاو!
بلاو، کلیک، کلیک، پاو، کلیک، پاو!
باعث ترافیک میشم وقتی کار کلاسیک پخش می کنم، حالا برش گردون
دخترا باعث میشم از تو دور شن
تو واقعا نمی خوای شروع کنی چون غرّش می کنم
(راور، راور، راور) بگذار من بیام و بازنده ها رو جمع کنم
وقتی شروع کنم هیچ وقت تمومش نمی کنم چون
وقتی ما میایم، بهتره درها رو قفل کنی
گرگ ها می خوان بخورن، ببین آرواره هاشون چطور قفل میشه
نیازی نیست کوکایین رو بپزم، ببین چطور خام قطع می کنم
و اگه به اندازه کافی نداشتی
بشین و لذتش رو ببر
چه خبره؟ با بیت برگشتم و رپ خشن هست
و ناخن هاشون رو می جَون و خودشون رو خیس کردن
و مثل تخمه آفتاب گردون ضعیف می شکنمشون
ببین این مهارت ها وزنم رو بالا بردن مثل سه تا وال
و میرینم به این مردا تا بدتر از بوی وید بو بدن
مرد تو از درخت افتادی
ببین چطور توییتر، فیسبوک و اینستاگرام یا ایمیل می کنن
حرف می زنن، فوق العاده هستم و به لرزه انداختمشون
با فروش بالا جوابشون رو میدم و ناتوانشون می کنم
ببین می پزم جوری که انگار بیزنس وید راه انداختم
و سه گرم بهشون میدم و مثل دخترا دنبال خودم می کشونمشون (صدای نفس کشیدن)
اُوه خوب ببین، این مردم الان می دونن
چطور همه چیز رو خراب می کنم، جدا از جزئیات
این پرونده تمومه، دوست دخترت منو یاد تعویضم می اندازه
ولی یه جورایی مثل یه هرزه کهنه هست
پایین میره جوری که انگار سکس تو زیرزمینه
ورم می کنه مثل این که تو شکمشون چوب می کنم
خیلی مودبانه، به طور دردناک اینا رو از خواب بیدار می کنم
مثل عروسک باهاشون رفتار می کنم و مثل میمونی که گیر افتاده بهشون حمله می کنم
منتظر تسخیر کردنم
و گردنشون رو مثل دستبند می شکنم، لعنتی
یه جورایی مثل وقتیه که با مشروب مست تو کامیون نشستم و دارم مسابقه میدم
ازشون رد میشم
و می زنمشون تا وقتی بمیرن
گذاشتم خوشحال تر از بچه ای بشن که تو پارک یه اردک رو دنبال می کنه
الان دیگه خنده داره که دنبال پولم، اینا هنوز دنبال بخت و اقبال هستن
مثل چکمه گره شون می زنم
وقتی صورتشون رو تو شُل فشار می دم (اَه)
موشک پرتاب می کنم وقتی وحشیانه رپ می کنم
بعد تو یه حرکت دایره ای برمی گردن
آتش بیشتری برای من فراهم میشه تا سطحش رو آب کنم
و صدا رو برگردونم
درحالی که آتیش می زنم چیزایی رو که پرتاب می کنم
پرستش خدایان رو ترک می کنم، به اطرافت نگاه کن
با  قدرت جوری کوبیدم که همشون به اطراف پخش شدن
حیف شد که خردشون کردم، باید پاره می کردم
سرت رو از شونه هات
با گلوله هایی بزرگ تر از یه صخره
بشکنمشون و می دونن که یه کلاسیکه
و این جوری که پیش میره می دونی که راحت شکست می خوری
ببین من و شِیدی باهم دیوونه ایم
مثل ساختن یه بمب خونگی تو آشپزخونه مثل آشپزها، تو یه هرزه ای
(ما این قدر فوق العاده ایم؟)
چون از هایتی میام، بهت پیشنهاد می کنم بهم پول بدی
نگذار دیوونه شم (آلالالا)
مثل یه اسرائیلی دیوونه ام، حرامزاده ها
وقتی که بیت رو می خورم و بیت رو گرم می کنم
پاهات رو قطع می کنم و الان مال من هستن
و با خیال راحت پاهام رو بالا می اندازم
به محله برگشتم و وحشی گری می کنم
امیدوارم مواظب بچت باشی
و مدت ها کنترلم رو از دست داده بودم
اینا می پرسن هوک مرده، نه
ولی بیت سرخ شده!


این انتقاد یکمی مسریه
ممکنه مریضت کنه
پس با این ناراحت شو، مغز من درست مثل تخم مرغ سرخ شده هست
ذهنم به هم خورده هست؟ (چون شعله ورم) ذهنم باریکه
ولی رد شدن مقدار زیادی از این حس این قدر مشکله
که خشم من باید از گوشه و کنارش بیرون بزنه
همین الان جلوی خونه کلیو دِیویس پیاده شدم
با خاطرات شخصیش که می گفت دو جنس گراست
یه تک ناین تکون میدم، یه نشونه اعتراض و رو ماشینش تخم مرغ می کوبم
مجبورش می کنم فریاد بزنه ""تجاوز جنسی"" و بعد لخت می رسم
و مستقیم می رونم بین جشن کارنیوال همجنس گراها
ییپیــ-کیــ-یِی، و من اینجا
صبر کن، دنیا همین الان رو پام خیس کرد؟
و باید به عنوان یه نشونه برداشت کنم؟ و شاید به گذشته ها ببرمشون (شیدی)
انگشت نما بودم، پس انگشت رو بهشون نشون دادم
تا توجه شون رو از صورتم دور کنم
همه رنگ بازی رو تغییر دادم
ولی فقط در صورتی که به این فکر می کردی که
بنویسی و رئیس رو عوض کنی
دیوونه ای، در اون صورت جوهر هدر میدی
پس اگر این نشونه ای از چیزیه که شاید باهاش روبرو بشی
بهتره یه تفاوتی ایجاد کنی چون تقلید مسخرت
یه تجربه بد ایجاد می کنن، لعنت به گذاشتن تاثیر بد
این بدترین تاثیرگذاریه که من دیدم و
کی تودماغی رپ می کنه، چشماش قهوه ایه و با دیوانه گری قافیه میگه
ولی به نظر میاد فلوناز لازم داره وقتی داره حرف می زنه؟
این چه سوال احمقانه ایه؟
هی، خانم آبراهام لینکن
جدا از مغز لعنتی شوهرت که چکه می کرد
به نظرت اون نمایش آخر هفته چطور بود؟
تو اسلیم شیدی واقعی نیستی، بشین سر جات، همجنس گرا
منو تو انتخابات می بینی؟ برای دلقک کلاس تلاش می کنم
دموکرات پولدار، هرزه، پس من فقط یه کاندیدم
تا بیام و همه پارتی رو به فنا بدم
من و دیوونه گریم با هم یه کمپین راه انداختیم
تا تو هر مجتمع یه کشتار راه بندازیم
مناسب سن لعنتیم رفتار کنم؟ من هشت سالمه، پس بیا خرد شیم
و روز بعد بیدار شیم تو اتاقی که به هم ریخته و همه جا باند زخمه
جاسیگاری شیشه ای خرد شده، و شَمپِین پاشیده روی لامپ ها
ولی این برای بحث نیست، این غیر قابل بحثه
شیدی برای رییس جمهوری، هو
نگذار برگردم به روزای قدیمی
جایی که تو رادیو سواِی و تِک، ال اس دی و دارو زیاد مصرف کرده بودم
تو برنامه وِیکآپ شو  تقریبا خواب رفته بودم
چی بهم میگین احمقا؟ من ناجور زندگی می کردم
تو یهودی ها داشتم جهنم می ساختم وقتی پنلوپ کروز هنوز داشت سینه در می آورد
من و باس مثل یه حیوون مریض قافیه می گذاریم پایین
تو با حرفه ای ها طرفی رفیق، بلاگ نویسای اینترنتی لعنتی
""من همه روز پشت کامپیوترم می شینم و نظر میدم
در مورد همه چیز، من تو همه چیز حرفه ایم، همه چیز بده، آهنگ بعدی رو پخش کن""
شاید اگر از لپ تاپ لعنتیت می پریدم بیرون، احمق خرفت
و با بیگی تا حد مرگ کتکت می زدیم، دِد رانگ می شدم
پسر خدا، مثل چوب تر نرم نیستم، منافذم هیچ وقت بسته نمیشن
این قدر اعتماد به نفس دارم که ازم بخار بلند میشه
آره، آره همه، آروم به چپ، همتون
دور شو وگرنه زیر پا له میشی
به اندازه لیرجِت لعنتیم تجاریم
حسادت به اندازه شیاپِت سبزت کرده
می تونم ببینم مشخصا ناراحتی، رفیق
توجه، توجه، دختر، توجه
وقتی به خونه ی درد من وارد بشی، تو دنیای رنج هستی، پس
بپر بالا، بپر، بپر، اون باسن رو بلرزون
بپر بالا، بپر، با یه آهنگ مورد علاقه طرفدارا اومدم
ولی اگه فکر می کنی برای مربی خیلی بالایی بهتره با دستای لعنتیت بال بزنی
مثل وَن هَلن بپر و برای باد موافق دعا کن
بیشتر از موفقیت می ترسم تا شکست
پس این چی رو بهت میگه؟
که تا حد زیادی هیچ اهمیتی به هیچ چیز نمیدم
مثل استَن که آخرین بسته طرفداریشو پست می کرد
قبلش مستقیم رفت تو مانع کنار جاده

I see y'all mad cause we be gettin' that dough
I know y'all mad at my pricey clothes
I'm a feisty nigga with a icy glow
I know y'all mad cause how my chain swing low
How I get that gauva, Now I get that dough
I be fuckin' it up
And I be cuttin' it up
And I be drunkin em up
And I tote two .45's
Tuckin' em up all on the side of my truck
As far as duckin' to what
Your gonna get to two hollow tips stuck in your gut
You people can't do nothing so they suckin' it up
So what you fussin' for? (what?)
And homey wait one second
Hold up a minute nigga you know I ain't checkin
I'm comin' up in this niggas
Up in the zone, you see the game like drugs, can't leave it alone
You see I'm keepin' the chrome in my waist line nigga
While I sit on my throne
And I get richer bitch, nigga me and Mike Jones
Y'all niggas got it all wrong Busta Bust in the building
If you think a nigga strong enough to fuck with us
A nigga King Kong so what, you want it nigga?
You could get it on to fuck
A little bit a snap when I get up in it (hoo)
A take a nigga trap, cause I came to get it (hot)
I might not wanna see nigga hit it (hoo)
At the ballpark, see the way I wear my fitted?
Let the bitch talk to them on phone
Get the gossip in up out a nigga, see we well known
Now Flipmode, Ice Age set the tone
From the Madison Square Garden to the Astrodome
I know y'all mad cause I roll in the Rolls
I know y'all mad cause I be pimpin' these hoes
Pimpin' these hoes, pimpin' these hoes, pimpin' these hoes
I see y'all mad cause we be gettin' that dough

I'm a feisty nigga with a icy glow
I know y'all mad cause how my chain swing low

Intro - there is only one year left,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Little Girl: Daddy what's it gonna be like in the year 2000?
Dad: Well sweetheart for your sake I hope it'll all be peaches & cream. But I'm afraid the end time is near. The cataclysmic apocalypse referred to in the scriptures of every holy book known to mankind. It will be an era fraught with boundless greed & corruption where global monetary systems disintegrate leaving brother to kill brother for a grain of over cooked rice
The nations of the civilised world will collapse under the impressive weight of parasitic political conspiracies which remove all hope & optimism from their once faithful citizens. Around the globe, generations of polluters will be punished for their sins. Unshielded by the O-zone they have successfully depleted, left to bake in the searing naked rays of light
Wholesale assassinations served to destabilise every remaining government, leaving the starving & wicked to fend For themselves. Bloodthirsty renegade cyborgs created by tax dodging corporations reek havoc. Pissed off androids tired of being slaves to a godless & gutless system, where the rich get richer & the poor get fucked over and out, unleash total world wide destruction by means of nuclear holocaust, annihilating the terrified masses, leaving in its Torturous wake nothing but vicious, cannibalistic, mutating, radiating, and horribly disfigured hordes of satanic killers, begged on revenge, but against whom? There are so few left alive
Starvation reins supreme, forcing unlucky survivors to eat anything & anyone in their path. Massive earthquakes crack the planets crust like a hollow egg shell, causing unending volcanic eruptions. Creatures of the seven seas Unable to escape the certain death upon land, boil in their liquid prison
Disease then circles the earth, plagues & viruses with no known cause or cure laying waste to whatever draws breath, and human-kind having proven itself to be nothing more than a race of ruthless scavengers, fall victim to merciless attacks at the hands of interplanetary alien tribes who seek to conquer our charred remains
This is Extinction Level Event
The Final World Front. And there is Only, One, Year, Left
Little Girl: Wow, that's cool, I can't hardly wait!

Light Up A Fire,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Colours of day dawn into the mind
The sun has come up, the night is behind
Go down in the city, into the street
And let's give the message to the people we meet
So light up the fire and let the flame burn
Open the door, let Jesus return
Take seeds of His Spirit, let the fruit grow
Tell the people of Jesus, let His love show
Go through the park, on into the town
The sun still shines on, it never goes down
The light of the world is risen again
The people of darkness are needing a friend
Open your eyes, look into the sky
The darkness has come, the sun came todie
The evening draws on, the sun disappears

I got that game (I got that game)
I caught a play (I caught a play)
We goin' long (we goin' long)
Do what I say (do what I say)
I've got my game face on (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I got my game face on, come on
The conglomerate, baby!
I don't want a war, drop them drawers
How it feel? Shit
Peep how they applaud
When I walk out on that field, bitch
Y'all already know the way I'm moving, anyway
I do this every day
Watch the way we execute the play
F*ck the shit you say!
Feelin' kinda sloppy, Nouveau Gotti
With the coup today
Mami, what my niggas do, I'm sorry
Yeah, they shoot the K
Here you know the motto
See we gotta get the loot and pray
For my enemies, pop them bottles
Follow suit and spray
F*ck the ref, nigga
F*ck the foul call
Hit her with the dick, she cursed me
For hittin' her with my foul ball
You can bring your friends, little mami
You know my style, though
'Case you ain't know, we ride on
Hey girl you say you like it deep, Hail Mary
Hey girl you know the play, Hail Mary
Tonight we going long, yeah, we be goin' long
Hey, huddle up, Hail Mary
I ain't tryin' to punt, Hail Mary
Tonight we goin' long
We be goin' long, Hail Mary
I got my chopper in my 'rari
In case I see my enemies
I don't know what's gotten into me
Tonight I'm on this Hennessy
I won't usually do the brown
But tonight is special (special)
Sam Rothstein be my agenda, yeah my special
My 2-door is retarded
I call that bitch special-ed
I don't even know her name
I just call her special-ed
Another year, same haters, usual suspects
Worried 'bout another nigga
I swear that shit is suspect
Keyser Soze, sold the yay, and I got away
Hit the club, bay air fresh, in case I die today
Hail Mary, told her it's the world, ain't got shit to lose
'Bout to go long, celebrate, like I'm Cindy Cruse
Whatever you want I got it
Got a drop-top in my pocket
You pop it, you watch it
Keep on poppin' and I'm a drop it
So hard to be alone, anyone'll go
But right here at this moment
You the one I want to roll, so
You got the ball baby, it's in your hands
I'm a be the coach, I'm a let you know the plan
What's next is, baby you and me exit
What now? I'm a get you naked
Do a little bit of sexin'
Touch down
And once you let me score
I'm a wanna score again
Double O, triple O, baby I'm a play to win
Say the best stuff, and see some good D
Hey girl I heard you like it deep
Tunchi in this muthaf*cka
Hail Mary, full of grace
I don't remember her name
But I remember how her pussy tastes
I go long, so long, she love the way that I put it down
Got you goin' in circles, all you gotta do is look around
I'm Mr. Right and she's Ms. Tonight
Pussy so nice, gotta kiss it twice
Pussy so tight my tongue get stuck
My tongue get stuck like lickin' ice
Hoes call me QB, I throw that dick too deep
I told her she's the preacher's wife
She said practice what you preach
She said ""ah, me so horny, he love me long time""
I say how 'bout 69, she say numbers don't lie
I say true, you ain't never told no lie
You ain't never told no lie
And you know they say love is blind
So close your eyes",https://genius.com/Busta-rhymes-hail-mary-lyrics

Back on my b.s. intro,Back on My B.S.,2009,"I made a decision, despite all the things that we go thru
I'm going to take more time with you, and be a friend indeed
I made a decision, that everything will be alright
Going to stay strong and keep it tight, I'll be there indeed
Let me talk to you, when it feels
Like the sun ain't shining bright enough
It's like the devil's trying to work to give????
And though I'm blessed
I still gotta handle of things I go through
It's good to have a friend, with another perspective to show you
Someone you know that knows you, and gives you motivation
Someone that you can go to, and vent your frustration
We always talk about our peeps, how we be everywhere
When you need 'em the most, are they really ever there?
See, every thing be all good when we be havin' fun
The difference is really needing a friend than having one
It's good when your peoples are there to help your problems
And help you smile about it while finding a way to solve it
Look at hear, let me keep it at 100 and let me tell ya
How you hold me down is something I genuinely value
I got a clearer view, and being that
You're always here for me I'll be here for you
I made a decision, despite all the things that we go thru
I'm going to take more time with you, and be a friend indeed
I made a decision, that everything will be alright
Going to stay strong and keep it tight, I'll be there indeed
Well, how you been baby? But I'm sayin'
Even though we probably link up every now and then
With minimal convo, look it's real good to see you friend
Something that we allow that I don't even have to mention
Is whether or not you got me
That's something that I never question
Sometimes I feel that the people
That I love don't appreciate me
And some hate to see the shit I've been going through lately
See you was here, when it started to haywire
You're still here, walkin with me going thru the fire
And I really love you for it, I know you all relate too
On everything that I believe and I appreciate it you
And just for that, it don't matter you can put that on my name
The way you rep me, let me be there just for you the same
Sometimes the pressure and the pain, it be wearin' me out
But I thank you for just bein' there and for hearin' me out
I got a clearer view, I thank
God that you're here for me and I'm here for you
I made a decision, despite all the things that we go thru
I'm going to take more time with you, and be a friend indeed
I made a decision, that everything will be alright
Going to stay strong and keep it tight, I'll be there indeed
I, look in your eye, and I see the pain in it
Life's a game, maybe the game did it
I know I changed, they say the fame did it
Life's changed, maybe the game did it
Two friends, now in two different places
And the mister catchin' planes, and you catching cases
Friendship, we never based it on position
No matter the game, we both shared the same vision
Decisions to split us in the place that life seemed to hit us
I would come to town and never get up, with you
Around then, things weren't so simple
I had my own issues that I was trying to get through
Outside chatter, messing with our mental
On the chase of???? trust, you can't forget to
It's the real friends, that you've got to tend to
No matter how far, just know that I'm with you
I made a decision, despite all the things that we go thru
I'm going to take more time with you, and be a friend indeed
I made a decision, that everything will be alright
Going to stay strong and keep it tight, I'll be there indeed

And sprinkle diamonds all over niggas flawless in D-Class
Then twinkle like a shine, just like a sparkle from clean glass
They movin' on a nigga as I walk through the valley, ready?
And zoom in with the cameras like I'm dickin' down Halle Berry
My money help me do things that you nigga's can't believe
Like purchase persons, places all them things that you can't conceive
Like interactin' with women the caliber of Janet
I sit and master my vision and massacre the planet
I hope you nigga's know just what it is
While I'm countin' my paper, nigga's know I'm handlin' my biz
Started out hustlin', ended up ballin'
Nigga I'm the shit, get the fuck up out my toilet
Started with my girlfriend, ended with her homies
Started out hustlin', ended up ballin'
Started out hustlin', ended up ballin'
Started out hustlin', ended up ballin'

Breakin’ Rules,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Breakin Rules (Feat Busta Rhymes)

Now put your hands up
Baby I wanna see you move
If you wanna get it poppin than show me just how you do
You can either give me head or fuck my whole crew
If you into breaking rules than listen to what you do

So put your hands up
Nigga I wanna see your jewels
If you never met a gangsta I show you just how we do
If you blink or move you on the 9 o clock news
I’m riding with flipmode
You ain't fucking with my crew

Being that gangsta nigga game tied
Combine a great mind with Dr Dre outside the club
You form a great line
You not a thug you ain't even in the club nigga
Roll up in the spot with a bunch of ceder block blood niggas
Scud missiles launch, holla like a bud nigga
Don’t stop, make the bitches follow (?)
While you ponder on my moves
Shit is kinda strange flipmode aftermath bank account number change
Since day 1 nigga east coast stompin
Game told me come through take a lil trip to Compton
The way they live around here the shit is evident
They do how like we buy weed down on (?) on President (Westside)
Same hood shit homes
You know we do it proper
At the Vibe award my Ratchet woulda really repped the Doctor nigga
Look close you see the damage I’m bringing
Aftermath nigga thats the band Im swinging


You think you got a nigga shook right
What you look like
In the club only Yankee fitted with a red light
Look left look right
Nigga we don’t tuck ice
Me and Busta Rhymes shine like Diesel truck lights
Styling with my chucks on
Gold chain plus stones
On the stores track I run the city like Puff Combs
And ever since they put Buss on
We be dropping gangsta shit while my competition making love songs
I got no problem watching Snoop getting his cuz on
Thank Jimmy Iovine for letting me put the buzz on it
They say I’m borderline disrespectful
I tell em suck my dick long as my wrist and neck glow
I put chicks on xo then show em the breast stroke
Hurricane game I splash and let her legs go
Far as my checks go got cribs in escrow
In three years flat Im crowned king of the west coast


Im bout the only rapper that ain't been jacked
How was that? cuz I pack that mack
Don’t make me clap cuz I going off yack
On a Scott Storch track
So sniff these lines while I chop that crack
You can sip that surp while we flip these birds
B stars flipmode thats what you heard coming out that trunk
I pump that base with a red bandana tied around my face
And a Louie V belt wrapped around my waist
Im so ridiculous, ignorant thats just how I was raised
Inconsiderate, belligerent and niggas would say
I ain't finish another album without f-ckin with Dre
He can’t finish Detox without f-ckin with me
Cus I’m young and I’m sick and I’m CPT
And I’m dumb and I’m rich niggas can’t see me
With red beams on the S-C-O-P-E

My Type Of Party,Catastrophic,2012.0,"'Glomerate, nigga
Yo Flizzy, you know we one and the same
This our type of party, nigga
You know what I'm sayin', like...
J-Doe!
These bitches actin' out, we love it though
Bussa Buss, nigga
Yeah
Spill it
Check it
It's my type of party
Scratch it up
Quiet Storm, me and T, nigga
It's Strong Island, I'm Neo
Run the jungle with Leos
Blunted but I keep C notes
Kill niggas in trios
Smoke weed with my PO
Pop mollys with Geo
F*ck bitches with Tyga
And I get money stacks with Cee Lo
Birdman is my homie
Busta Rhymes is my brodie
I don't trust these bitches
Carryin' monsters like they Cody
Say I'm trill if they know me
Sue woo to my homies
Saint Ives bottle in my hand
But I'm in the club carrying that 40
Came with bitches that's bocky
Know they bad, so they cocky
Struttin' hard through that lobby
Headed outside to ride my Bugatti
They got drunk in this party
Now these bitches all horny
And I was foamin like Roddie
So I pulled it out and let the bitch blow me
Get my jewelry from Jacob
I don't shop at Benny's
Chain yellow and red
Shit looks like at Wendy's
Money stacks, I got plenty
Look at my feet, my shoes, they say Fendi
In a trap spot I'm vamping like Jerry
Cooking that work up like it's Denny's
Your girl got a cute face
Her friend got a nice body
And they just wanna have fun
This my type of party
Twenty bitches in the lobby
There's plenty bitches in my lobby
And they all drinkin', they smokin'
This my type of party
Bitch we bubble like soda
Sellin' these verses like coca
Bitch respect my persona
Or I'll leave your ass up in a coma
What's poppin'? Slam, okra
Twistin' it good like yoga
Kiss your bitch then I stroke her
They complain 'cause I got too much exposure
All of my meals I eat kosher
Blackout, break a nigga shoulder
Put the ratchet back up in the holster
Sick with it like I was pneumonia
I like your chain but it's a loaner
Can't talk to me, nigga hold up
Short breath nigga, I'm a grownup
See the space shuttle when a nigga roll up
Shift the clusters when I touch that gas
It's must a nigga bust that ass
In disgust the way you lust that trash
While we in the club and now we got it on smash
Smashin' every arena
International Visa
When I'm done a nigga need FEMA
Can't breathe, got emphysema
White lines on a black table, zebra
Sniff coke, become another creature
Tiptoeing on top of the speaker
Bitch, strip club dance like a ballerina
See me move with my army
F*ck you niggas, I'm sorry
With my caviar and my coffee
Bitch this my type of party
Bad hoe in my place
Stacked with a nice body
She just talkin' 'bout f*ckin'
That's my type of party
Twenty hoes tryin' to call me
It's plenty hoes tryin' to call me
And niggas tryin' to be next
That's my type of party, okay
Ridin' round in my space ship
Fresh off of vacation
My bitch look amazing
Your bitches look basic
Hear your shit and change stations
My style is looking like greatness
Your swag need some donations (hold up)
Shout out to my boy Dom
LA niggas, we on

Show love for the bitches and put it down for my brudda
Hot butter funk make it rain, close the shutter violate
Catch it from one of my bitches, boxcutter
Ah, articulate, feels so great
That I can bless my niggas with shit they appreciate
No jive y'all niggas can take a nosedive
Shit so live bitches wanna give me a high five, five
Uh, fuck it, it is a must we hold grands
Get with the program and fuck bitches who love to hold, hands
Foul shit, way out of order
Fuck shit up leave bitches hot and sweaty drippin' buckets of water
Disorderly conduct, will erupt
When the live shit come on niggas do what they wanna
Aight bitches, now show yo' asses
The shit we droppin' be sure to get y'all movin'

Got you givin' me an award, floored a couple on the come up
Stretched a few, put 'em flat on they back
And laid 'em stiffer than a board, the way I make my niggas applaud
My price tag, just to show up the shit
Might be somethin' you can't afford
Make you say the Lord is my shepherd, how we astonish
Move forward on novice niggas like Cedric Ceballos with a hot song
Now niggas know we rock on, cock-strong
All y'all niggas is straight popcorn, ah
Talk the trash, comin' forth get past lie duke
Pass shorty with the big horse ass
Now ain't no stoppin' how we comin' full blast
Mix the fire with gas, that's how we put it on smash
No lie, never deny so hot we cook the shit well done
Just like a deep fish fry
Uh, snap crackle and pop, what we drop and how we keep shit comin'
How we maneuver so fly, so high is where we gon' take it
Controllin' the land, controllin' the sea
Now we control the whole sky
Perhaps make niggas collapse make bitches shake they shit to the floor
And feel the soul up in my raps and your face is the gutter we slap
Make you crash all in your whip when you drive
I hope your seatbelt's strapped, aight niggas, now throw yo' hands up
The shit we droppin' be sure to get y'all movin'

I ride my shit on fish bowl, just me and my kin folk
Ballin' like we just got drafted, jeans could pay your rent, hoe
I am the #1 draft pick, I'm spazzin', I'm smashin'
My whip Sunset blasting, my own shit, I'm on, bitch
They be lookin' at the nigga like ""oh shit!""
I'm chosen, I'm glowin', my wrist look like it's snowed in
I'm in the freshest clothing, don't act like you ain't knowin'
'Bout J-Doe, I'm great hoe, I be everywhere that you can't go
I hit the game at a different angle
These boys gettin' paid with the same flow
I'm on my own shit, you see me getting' paper
I'm still a ghetto nigga, those rich folks is my neighbours
I'm getting more popular, so I'm gettin' way more haters
But them boys on the ground, I'm on that elevator
As you can see it's going down
Actually it's not, let me turn that bitch around
They say it's going down, I say it's going up, stupid
And I got the dough to prove it with my elevator music
Okay, my elevator music
Life is going good, I need my elevator music
They say it's going down I say it's going up stupid
And I got the dough to prove it, with my elevator music
Come on
Why all niggas wanna watch me
Question in the move that I mean
Twenty years later bitch, a lot of bitches say that I'm great
I only say that I'm straight
Six o'clock and you mother f*ckers
I see a lot of niggas who are haters
I'm a need you block and you mother f*ckers
Time in time and then I'm coming again
Whatever game watch, in and zone
Call a bitch and let it play with a pussy
Feel me bitch and my camera phone
Watch out now you're in the danger zone
Just give me the ass and leave me alone
Just do it with the ass and you could go home
Baby girl wildnin', I can only grown
And then I pay attention to the way you're behaving
You already see a nigga, you right
Frontin' 'bout all the good pussy you saving
But you know a nigga wanna spread you right?
But it in your head and demonstrate the way he use it
We're climbin' maxin' while we're elevating
Elevator music, go!
You ain't read the headline I'm so dope I might get fed time
And y'all boys ain't made a check 'cause your style passes deadline
For this other motherf*ckers it's bedtime, my team is taking over
You can't beat us or join us bitch, so you might as well no rep no more
I'm on your, girlfriend's, list of favorite artists
My flow sound like Harvard, y'all niggas sound retarded

I'm getting' to the money every ma'f*ckin' way
I let all these hoes come over but not one of them can stay
And this shit gon' never change 'til I'm old and I'm gray

Just another day at the range
I’m lickin’ off shots, just perfecting my aim
Can’t be gettin’ too caught up in the game
Even worse when ya gotcha self a little bit of fame
So I go to the range

I put a couple rounds in the chamb
Visions of my little cousin on the corner, slain
Now I’m squeezin’ the thang, I could easily bang
Tryina keep all that evil shit, outta my frame
That’s why I go to the range
I see some rednecks with shit I can’t even name
Sayin to myself; I better do it the same
Revolution comin’ – shit it already came
They called it “A hurricane,” that’s why I got to the range
300-mag oughtta ease the pain
One-shot mami, betta stay in ya lane
Cuz I don’t gotta kill you, I could leave you maimed
You know what I’m sayin’?
Bullets do have names (Yeah, yeah)
That’s why I go to the range (Yeah, yeah)

Just another day at the range
Cuz practice makes perfect, nigga, ain’t nothin’ changed
I mastered killin’ shit, that’s why you look at me strange
Especially the opposable is damage-up ya frame
That’s why I go to the range
See how a nigga playin’ the game
Rep for any battlefield, ‘specially defendin’ my name
I’m the one that they blame, they speculation is lame
That shit is bug. When nigga’s talkin’, ain’t got nothin to gain
That’s why I go to the range
When-I-Lock the streets hope you niggas hear what I’m sayin’
And the fact that I’m here, the very reason I came
Dominate the hood, you see it’s simple and plain
It ain’t nothin’ but just a thang, the way I’m comin’ to claim
Nigga’s gona take the crown I’m here to put you to shame

Huh, check it is

Just another day at the range
I’m lickin’ off shots, just perfecting my aim

Cash Money / Young Mula,Catastrophic,2012.0,"Yo, yo, yo, yo...
Young Mula
Ain't nothin' more important than the mula
Ain't nothin' more important than the mula
Hallelujah, hallelujah, praise God, hallelujah
Every time I talk I got these niggas sayin' ""damn, he nice""
""Oh shit! Can't believe it! Motherf*ck! Jesus Christ!""
So many blocks of diamonds shinin' on me like a big piece of ice
Cook that coke up for the hood like a nigga got a pot full of peas and rice
Yeah...
You see we off to the future
I don't mingle with broke niggas 'cause I don't talk to losers
Okay - yeah, I know - you niggas heard them rumors
It's official (Conglomerate) Cash Money, Young Mula
Pop a bottle, pour liquor on the floor
Pop a molly, then I f*ck a couple hoes
Pop a band, see all this money on my soul
And I will pop you band in case a nigga didn't know
Ain't nothin' more important than the mula
See how I swag on a bitch like it's nothin', dippity doo da!
Nothin' more important than the mula
All the Spanish bitches call me Papi Chula
Stay on deck, I always got the Ruger
Face shot make 'em look like Freddy Kruger
Mercy - please lord, show me mercy
I was faded off the molly when I f*cked that bitch raw
Please let her not have herpes
'Cause I swear if a bitch ever burn me
I'm a shoot a hoe down like Worthy
These niggas walk around with they mouth
Pants on some 300 shit lookin' like Xerxes
Real Gs over here, that trill shit
You girl asked me, did I use a steel dick?
Naw hoe - that's that third leg 9 flow
I be on that pimp shit like Chicago
And a nigga flip cane like Pablo
And y'all niggas look like 5-0
Askin' 'bout all my slimes, yo
'Cause we booked a team, but homie for the green
We put nines on niggas like Rondo
'Glomerate, YMC, yo, bombin' shit
Big Bs to the Billy Badass niggas that be on that Tony Montana shit
Ain't nothin' more important than the dollar bill
I'm goin' hard and I go harder once I got a 'mil
This white girl just popped a pill and told me ""cop a feel""
Okay, this road to riches, come with a lot thrills!
My flow is cold, bitch, I just caught a chill
I mean my flow is hot like it's on the grill
You m'f*ckas better know the drill
A lot of niggas rappin', but none of them is real
Shows, clothes, dough, yeah, I get all the above
The DJ spinnin' all my shit when I walk in the club
A thousand beehives, I got a bigger buzz
Yeah, I'm addicted to the mula, I can't get enough!
Where my real niggas that's gon' ride for me?
Where my fine freaks that's gon' ride for me?
Where my real niggas that's gon' ride for me?

Yeah, see now - see now, I - I was reminiscing on some shit
(Let y'all niggas know, I am the nicest ever)
Yeah, just in case you niggas wasn’t really understanding what was going on
It's Busta Bust, nigga! Mick Boogie! Check it! Let's go!
Since I was a youngin’, I would walk in the street
And I was takin' what's mine (Commissioner!)
(C‘mon, c'mon!) When I was young, see, I was packing a punch
Little feisty motherfucker quick for taking your lunch
None of my niggas rockin' with me would squeal
Everybody getting got
As long as they ain't have no swine in they meal
Every day, I go to school and I be rollin' with all of my dogs (Bark!)
Like I was groaning, I was really impressin' a broad
Every day, we were stepping to niggas - ""Hey, yo, what’s up?""
Better run it or we’re coming to dig up all in your pockets
Every now and then, they might throw a punch back
At the end of the day, they had to pay for they lunch back
(Bark!) Now, you know, my bark was rude, after a while
I realized the kids was cool with paying me for they food
(Okay, okay!) Must've been something, I saw cash flow
I ain’t only lust for the cake, I fell in love with the dough (Let's get this money!)
(Oh, this is sweeter than life; Oh, this is sweeter than life)
Now, I ain't never believed shit could be so sweet
When niggas could get paper so easy
This motherfucker feels so good
Taking a little nigga's lunch money and his lunch
And making him pay for his lunch to get his lunch back
Yeah, that’s how we got his lunch money, too
Yeah, that's how we on it (C'mon!)
Got the chance to go and start to bubble some coke
And started taking what was mine (Alright, alright!)
Got a little older, married this thing called strugglin'
Hustling, trying to find bigger things to be bustin' in
Even though sometimes we fighting and we tusslin'
We shorties hoein' that paper, through the hustlin' and bustlin'
And I stand on the corner, smoke a blunt with my clique
My dog (Bark!) ever blessed me when he front me a brick (You best believe that!)
(As we get down and dirty with powder and coked the coke
And flipped a brick in 36 hours)
(Now, what you say?) We out of town and now we doin' it greasy
My money sick, unbelievably, and comin' in easy (Let's get this dough!)
The Reaganomics era was right and actual
Shit, the coke was so good, the fiends was smoking the capsules (That shit is bond!)
Brick-flipping in a day and a half, black
I never heard or seen no money sweeter than that (That shit was crazy!)
(Oh, this is sweeter than life; Oh, this is sweeter than life)
Yeah, money was rolling in like a motherfucking floodgate was opening
Shit, the shit was so sweet, nigga
It was such a time for niggas
You know what I mean, niggas would go out of town
And set up shop in little crackhead cribs and bubble
Yeah, you know, niggas would run up in the mall and buy about 30 pairs of sneakers
Little niggas that was getting it
Now that I'm a man who has to see a lot of shit
You know, I'm taking what was mine (Fo' sho, fo' sho!)
Thinkin' big and now I'm trying to own land
Getting up now, I'm older, nigga
Think as a grown man
Niggas is having seeds, gotta create a new hoe plan
Tired, I went to hustles
Hold the crack in my cold hands
So then, I started to spit, hollerin', ""Where my dogs is at?""
Run up in labels, hollerin', ""Where your bosses at?""
So determined to get this new cake (Like, here we go)
To put some better food on my plate (So, what you do?)
Spit the shit, the streets, the love and respect
And in return, got corporate America cuttin' me checks (That's only right!)
This was some new shit, for me to get loose to
Started feeling the love, different from what I was used to (What's the haps?)
Fucking lots of hoes, getting a lot of the dough
Money bigger, plus we doin' award shows
Now, sing this shit
(Oh, this is sweeter than life; Oh, this is sweeter than life)
(Yeah, yo!) You know it's beautiful
When you ain't - when you ain't gotta sell no more of that shit
You know what I mean, you can put the crack down and shit
Money legal now, nigga got a little rap paper
Real successful now, nigga (Yeah!)

What the fuck nigga
What you want
What the fuck nigga (We gon hit it down like this nigga what)
Check it out
I be
Testing your fate and wrecking your face
Invading your space
And watch the tables turn like you're trading a place
I pull stunts like evil kadeival
Me and my people fly like an eagle
And blow your entire cathingil
Hurry hurry
Don't worry worry
Hit y'all with a flurry flurry of jazz
Leaving y'all niggas blurry blurry
Brew up some shit like I'm cooking for y'all
When I'm done then I come looking for y'all
(Huh huh hold up hold up)
Federal cases cause nuff bodies end up in medical places
In they blood finding them chemical traces
Leaving special investigators going through skeptical phases
While we getting money the decimal changes
I was a seven-day affentice apprentice
Now I strike with a vengeance
Blowing the door right up off of the hinges
This be that put you out of your misery song
And make you ask your man is this the joint he dissing me on
That's when I ask
Chorus:
What the fuck nigga what you want

What the fuck nigga what you want
What the fuck nigga what you want
What the fuck nigga what you want
What the fuck nigga
Moving your muscle and doing the hustle
See nowadays we getting money like rustle
Who really wanna tussle
Challenge the super saber in a nigga
Blast the challenger way out of space like Galica nigga
Battle star Galactica cross my diameter nigga
Derange your whole circular shape into triangular nigga
Yo
So what it was my fault
That I had to bring this shit to a screaming halt
What you need to do is open up the vault
That's why I make sure that my vest will be on
So when I blast you and your additional stress will be gone
Then I sprinkle just a little bit of salt on your plans
And watch your shit shrivel up right in the palm of my hands
I ain't afraid of ya
But I thank all of my niggas for saving ya
I was about to take you back
To when your mother was making ya
Clapping you up
Slapping you up
Trapping you up
Holding you hostage
Duck taping and Saran wrapping you up
Yo
First she was sober
I smell aroma
Put you in a Trans
And slip into an irreversible coma
Fuck y'all cubic zirconium niggas it's over
Closing in on all y'all niggas
While we're moving in a little closer
Then I evaluate and elaborate
Confiscate your shit and dare your ass to retaliate
That's when I ask

Now, there ain't no way that you could kill the beast dead
I got Middle East women and Middle East bread
I got oil well money in the desert playing golf
Dolce shorts, dashiki with a Louie Scarf
Chest cold, diamonds make a nigga wanna cough
In Dubai, 20 million on the villa loft
And then I step up in the club and then these other niggas mad as shit
The way I make the people wanna sing the hook in Arabic!

Big bitches, knock-kneed camel-toed groupie shit
Women walk around while security on camelback
Club on fire now, niggas don't know how to act
Sittin' in casinos while I'm gamblin' with Arafat
Money long, watch me purchase pieces of the Almanac
Y'all already know, I got the streets buzzin'
While I make you bow down and make Salaat like a Muslim

While I use stacked chips and count Arab money now
I don't need to get fresh, about to grow a beard duke
So much cake even the money look weird too
Domestic bread, and I'm broad, I'm tryna eat right
Prince Alwali, Bin Talal, Al Saul
They respect the value of my worth in Maui, Malaysia
Iran and Iraq, Saudi Arabia!

House Of Pain 2003,Salute the General,UnKnown,"The motherfuckin' dust kicker, who can you trust?
Do you have the heart to see a nigga, before you bust?
My name is spoken on the tongues of so many foes
Bustin' motherfuckers out the box, I ain't even go!
Now how the hell do you explain my claim to fame?
From doin' flicks to bustin' tricks out the fuckin' frame
Got these bitches on my jock, niggas on my block
Jealous ass suckers got 'em duckin' from my smokin' Glock
And bustin' niggas asses is to stay alive
Skinny ass player watchin' bigger motherfuckers fry
They ask me how I'm livin', I'm a hustler
Buckin' busters 'til they die
Now it's on in the ghetto you ain't heard?
Niggas got they AKs headin' for the 'burbs
Aimin' at them skin headed bitches let it rain
Givin' 'em a wet welcome to the house of pain

House of pain
House of pain
House of pain
Welcome to the house of pain
House of pain
House of pain
House of pain
Welcome to the house of pain
Whoa, whoa

Huh, the country bud got me chokin'
I'm on a mission to the point that motherfuckers think I'm smokin'
Yea that sick nigga Biggie wit the 8-shot fifth
Wit the extra clip for that extra shit
Don't you know that a killing is thrilling
All the blood spilling, is all a part of drug dealing
A born gangsta my daddy was a thug
Had a .38 wit the hollow point slug
So when he licked shots
Niggas dropped quicker than a bootlegger sells his liquor
A little nigga tried to squeeze .22's in my Reebok shoes
Payin' dues, while kids was on their one's and two's
Now I'm much older, colder, fuck a holster
Got the MAC-11 swingin' from my shoulder
It's a damn shame I got to put my momma through the strain
I'm livin' in a house of pain

House of pain
House of pain
House of pain
Welcome to the house of pain
House of pain
House of pain
House of pain
Welcome to the house of pain
Whoa, whoa

Yeah, yeah, check it
Niggas talking about doing this and doing that
Fucking mouth bigger than the fattest bitch's ass-crack
Add and subtract on minus faggots
Groupies bring the violence to maggots
I'll silence you bastards and then I
Embarrass and disrespect niggas, shameful
Cut the convo short and keep the beating painful
Finger hugging a trigger like a pussy I'm fingerin'
Shots to you 'till I see them teardrops tricklin'
You fuckin' with a grown man and you ain't half-grown
Or half-known, you faggot, I'll shoot you all in your calf bone
What you get in it for? I'll have you niggas sitting down
Front and walk with a bop, I'll make you niggas limp around
In case you didn't know I'm still a hungry rich nigga
Chop faggots to pieces and eat a little bitch nigga
Dog's not appropriate for women and children
I spit your pieces out and hang them on the side of a building
Yeah, tie you up and make one of my bitches doo-doo on you
With your FUBU on you like I was performing voodoo on you
Heat rock while you just watch a nigga heat drop
Streets stop while I'm talking, and push you through a sheet rock
A whole lot of iron and cocked a lot of hammers
While I give you modes and principles, teaching you niggas manners
Oh yeah, y'all niggas know what's up? You know my name?
While I initiate you motherfuckers in the house of pain

House of pain
House of pain
House of pain
Welcome to the house of pain

Turn It Up [Clean Version],UnKnown,UnKnown,"Verse 1:
We grind ya'll
Bounce back, open your mind ya'll
Grind your whole ass till you twist your waistline
Ya'll know the time
Hey yo feel the base line
Stack the overdrive
Bounce, baby feel the incline
So geniune, everytime, Busta redefine
The wicked new design
Makin ya'll press rewind
Hope you feelin fine
Watch me combine and intertwine
The bounce rock skates shit make you cross the foul line
Shine a nickel nine
On all kinds of little swine
Stick you worse than porcupine
If you tryin to take mine
Yo, pick up my nigga Splif
In the blue 5S's
Sportin out tan, interior blue head restses
Move, baby no time for second guesses
Been articulate the right bounce as the flow finesses
Yo we gettin papers spread love and happiness's
Shit blazin so hot DJ's scratch the test presses
Like make it mo hot baby *chorus comes in*
Chorus:
Turn it up, I wanna hear it real loud, just
Turn it up, so we can party in the loft, baby
Turn it up, we need to tear the roof off, so just
Turn it up, I need to make it mo hot, baby
(repeat first three lines, finish with 'Turn it up')
Verse 2:
Yo, word is bond
Baby let's get it on
I never say it wrong
Yo baby girl take off your thong
Let me put it in your spirit like the holy Quran
Got the mega song
Sweet like honey chicken dijon
Movin along
Yo, honey body look real strong
Watch your ass swing
Hangin like a medallion
Exercise baby let me see you spread on the floor
What you askin for?
Relax, I'm bout to give you some more
Where the liquor store?
Hit you with some more metaphor
The raw, hot to def shit you never seen it before
Hit the deck, on your mark, get set, we bout to jet
Spark it like ingelet, chickens breakin their neck
Yo we play to win
Such a shame, shit is a sin
So hot baby body heat bubble your skin
Everytime I flow speak
I caress the whole beach
Just like the body guard Les straight walkin the street
We get down
Chorus
Verse Three:
Yo, come on baby just feel my heat wave
A lot of hot ones ready for niggas who act brave
Chill son, you better off if you behave
Flip money while broke niggas tryin to save
Lay low, I say so, my pesos
Import my cheese stack by the castros
Make clothes
Or stay fly a chase hoes
Equatorians soft lips and straight nose
Makin dough
When we rippin the paid show
Get the money and dip, we in the Range Rove
Now we makin grands
We name brand
We make plans, change plans
Then we expand across land
Do it properly
Yo, I said open sesame
The recipe, be the hot shit, it's got to be
Yo, landscape
We arrange a whole shape
Rock the fly tape
Then I continue to skyscrape
Like aaaah!!!!!!!!!!!
So hot

What You Know About It,Catastrophic,2012.0,"Nigga, you know who the f*ck we is?

F*ck boy, I'm a money hoe
I truck a wealthy nigga 'fore you ever see my money low
Alfredo, I got fettuccini, they be rappin'
Talkin' all that money they never seen
Frontin' like you got bank roll
Nigga, you don't make dough
Birthday over, one slice left of cake, though
They be on that funny shit, we be on that money shit
Catch 'em drinkin', pull up on that bar, give you a 20 clip
Rap life, trap life, black white, stash pipes
Back streets maskin' up watchin' for the flashlights
Your girl wanna suck me off, she ain't have to ask twice
Big strong brother and I'm out like it's my last night
Cocaine cowboy, long island D-Boy
Blow is raw and that thing gleamin' like Leroy
Black and yellow Smith & Wesson that's my bumble bee toy
And they gon' reminisce over your ass, trouble T-Roy
Yeah! Yeah! When I let that thing go
The whole club sleepin' on the floor like it's hangover
Monday is Juliette's, Tuesday is Green House
Wednesday and butter, I'm a pull out all this green
And let it go!
What you know about it?
Get green, whip clean, what you know about it?
Put them, put them hands up if you know about it
Don't never see a broke motherf*cker 'round me

Get green, whip clean, what you know about it?
Put them, put them, put them hands up if you know about it
You ain't never seen a broke motherf*cker 'round me
Mad machete, Busta Rhymes, you ain't ready, boy
F*ckin' somethin' up when it's comin' to that fetti, boy
Lil' lame niggas better get your parachute and jump
Get up off my plane 'fore my niggas para-shoot-you-up
Think I'm sayin' peace when I throw them f*ckin' deuces up?
I'm only signalin' niggas to start hangin' them nooses up
Somebody gonna die, break a branch just to beat you
Go! Chop the body parts and let the pigs eat you
Holes through every part of your body we can see through
Continue blowin' the cannon, I wouldn't wanna be you
I let it go like I'm sick and hear voices
Spend money like a nigga copped a fleet of Rolls Royces
Prepared to purchase everything while exploring the choices
Then enjoy eatin' your food like I'm eatin' lobsters and oysters
Time and time again I got 'em walkin' like a fiend walk
I'm done speakin' to niggas, I'm a let the homie Doe talk
Brought twenty thou out and I'm a blow it
Your man pullin' fifteen hundred out just to show it
If shorty ain't drinkin' hard liquor we'll Moet
Then it's to the Tele suite afterward so she can hoe it
She gon' swallow all of me, I'm a blow her brains out
My kids need a place to live, her mouth like a safe house
Loud pack of kush and that Goose got me spaced out
Standin' on the sofa fadin', sweatin' all my waves out (faded)
In my new Trews, slow bucks, long sleeve
Lookin' like I need to be posin' under palm trees
And I'm quick to let my four squirt
Unemployed gangster nigga, you don't want no work
We live by the hustler testament
We cop a brick and take it to the floor like we wrestling
Throw it in the pot with the fish and we stretchin' it
Go and hug the corner like we sexin' it, f*ck boy
Eighteen-wheeler jewelry game truck, boy
She ain't drop, don't be a hater, let her cook, boy
My chrome and black nina call her lady luck
And any time you see her goin' down she gon' give it up

You try to be a tough guy, and complicate what I build
Somebody don't beat the shit out this muh'fucka (WE WILL!)

Asthmatic, dramatic, fold you like a Kraftmatic
Heavy metal press hittin your chest like a train wreck
Command respect, throw it one time for your set on deck
Niggas you never forget
I set up precedents, homey you never snitch, hide the evidence
Dummies dig ditches, they dyin for dead presidents

We still stand ( sos for haiti ),UnKnown,UnKnown,"I would like to share one of my memorable accomplishments in music with you
It's a song that i had the and honor to write ans sing on with busta rhymes and
Haitian mass for haiti
It wasn't planned for me to write on it
I just happened to have been at the right place at the right time
The message is simple
Though the land may tremble
We will stand
Busta did an incredible job sharing his thoughts on this project
I had to really ask myself is this brother haitian
When in reality... all you have to be is ... human to undersant just how catastrophic this earthquake was
I want you guys to hear it for yourself...
Heck this out...
Busta rhymes
And while my thought wander, i don't know where to start
Forgive me for what i speak, emotion leading from my heart
Before i continue, i hope my words reach you
Lighters up for haiti such a beautiful people
Such a beautiful country... do they deserve to suffer?
Such a beautiful nation, such a beautiful culture
And while my heart is racing and i address the topic . what the reason their facing
Something so catastrophic
And while i search for answers and balace my thoughts equal, all i can come up with is god is testing the people
It so incredible to witness the strength of the righteous and clear example of how we come togeter in crises
But the point i'm trying to make is that we shouldn't slack, to come together like this when it's after the fact
To see the heros that we had when it rains and it showers
See how the blessing manifest , unity is power 
Chorus
We will stand
We will stand, hand in hand
We will rise up again a stronger nation
Maybe broken, but not destroyed...
Can you hear us... can you feel us
We will stand, hand in hand
We will rise up again
A stronger nation
Busta rhymes
I undersand if what i'm saying makes you tighten up
We rep'n beautiful haiti... keep your lighters up
Don't mean to question god
Are these people forsaken
Never that
With only time we'll build a stronger nation
Stronger foundation
Now watch the world look
And come together until we write every history book
Let us light up candles
For the hundreds of thousands we lost and lead by example
Let's show each other the potential of rising above
The agony of living hell through universal love
A universal hug, holding up each other
Our fathers and our mothers
Our sisters and our brothers
Despite the shapes and colors
The object is to give
Appreciate the breath we breathe and the life we live
See all the heros that we have when it rains and showers 
And watch the blessing manifest ...
Unity is power
Chorus
We will stand
We will stand, hand in hand
We will rise up again a stronger nation
Maybe broken, but not destroyed...
Can you hear us... can you feel us
We will stand, hand in hand
We will rise up again a stronger nation
The land may tramble...
But we continue to hold on",https://genius.com/Busta-rhymes-we-still-stand-sos-for-haiti-lyrics
Suicide Bounce,UnKnown,UnKnown,"(feat. Busta Rhymes)
(Busta Rhymes)
Ay fellas
I think you might wanna s-s-sneak your ratchet in here for this one
Ay ladies
Put your petroleum jelly on your face
Yo Nas, we got a big bet in the streets
That you knock they ass out in the first 30 seconds of the first round
GET 'EM!
(Verse One: Nas)
Sittin up drunk, shufflin thoughts
Got paper but I'm lost
Losin focus what a nigga still hustlin for
My seed is straight, the fam is settled
Idle time get the man in trouble
When wifey tourin, my life get boring
Start to remember all types of torment
The devil's callin, but I don't answer
Mom passed from cancer, leavin behind
Two granddaughters, two grandsons, two 9's
Next to me in the Phantom, who lyin?
Big screen documentaries of Idi Amin
Gotta, try to stay away from creeps
With they bullshit, tryin to put me back in the streets
War stories, funerals
Where feds be layin from a dreadful slayin
Body viewing's at the wake
Nigga sit stiff in his Ferrari, no casket
With his eyelids still open, it's kinda spooky
Iceman watch on, the suit Gucci
I'm above the standard
But dude just Mar-salis than Branford
Thinkin you're too rich, they wanna gun ya
Kidnap ya cause of they hunger, but you fuckin with hunters
Camoflauged in black hoods that dump clips
Cause real niggas die over dumb shit
Camoflauged in black hoods that dump clips
Cause real niggas die over dumb shit
(Chorus 2X: Busta Rhymes)
Fight, fists, dance, suckah
Suicide, bounce, brother
Ice, whips, cash, nigga
Watch yo', big, ass, momma
(Verse Two: Nas)
To your, power structure, Nas is dangerous
Y'all the antithesis, the opposite
Twitchin shit, all up in your body language
Mean muggin your bitch, cause she leans over
To look closer told you y'all sloppy gangsters sayin
""Nas is this and Nas is that""
Your eyes go front, your eyes go back
Surprised I'm at the same place y'all be at
It's obvious you don't know how I react
Like, I don't know where the party's at
You're foamin at the mouth, losin breath
Like a cardiac arrest, but I ain't impressed
Cause the fact is, y'all don't really want it
Two to the head, fo' to the stomach
Call more security cause I come off
Anywhere you at you scary cats
If you dare squeeze back, guns shall rain
A thousand times harder than when I first came
Y'all not relentless, y'all dumb
And y'all just forgot about the consequences
Not a jail sentence, but see
The nigga you feed'll kick it to dude that kick it to me
We posess, the recipes for death, cause jealousy destroys
Feed the dog first, watch out for salmonella poisoning
I know a kid who'll throw shit in your food
And say, ""That's the way you kill a man, avoid the shooting""
Hey...
(Chorus)
(Outro)
You smile, in my face
Secretly I know, you want my place
You waitin on me to choke, don't want a nigga to breathe
You wanna come cut my throat, you wanna get rid of me
But before I let it happen them guns gon' start clappin
And y'all gon' rest in peace, cause death is the recipe
Before I let it happen them guns gon' start clappin
And y'all gon' rest in peace, cause death is the recipe

I lead inside
Why you got your ass on your shoulders

Yeah bitch put on an outfit, dazzle ya hair
Come in the club fit to take you home and frazzle the hair
Bitch understand I must have got a handle in here
Why you open up ya ass and let me travel in there
Create a scandal in there
Don't talk, let me pull it out to add another angle in there
Let me ride the back of yo ass like a camel in there
Pussy hot like she lit a fuckin' candle in there
Remember I was tryin' to get my drink in the slot
And you was same girl actin' all stinkin' the spot
It was funny how I thought I wasted breath on the broad
A friend couldn't find her cause shorty left with the God
And then I took her back to the crib, you can figure it out
I'm diggin' it out with the dick in her mouth
Get cha' homegirl to come start lickin' ya out
And swingin' about until I start kickin' em' out
Because ya...

I'm sayin' she fuck a nigga like she want the God to lay in a hearse
Makin' me curse, hope you relate to my verse
And what be makin' it worse
That they be the same bitches frontin' like they wasn't with it at first
Actin' too good for niggas with your ass on your shoulders
But now you'll be fuckin' a nigga till he fall in a coma
I remember how you acted in the front of ya friends
As I remember now you give me head in front of my Benz
So now I'm smackin' it up, while you backin' it up
With a car load of bitches now I'm packin' it up
Now ya whole crew comin' and we whackin' em' up
Let me beat the pussy till I start blackin' it up
Got bitches diggin' in my back scratchin' it up
Got em' screamin' shatterin' glass crackin' it up
Get cha' homegirl to come start lickin' ya out
Ass swingin' about till I start kickin' em' out
Because ya...

Sayin' in ya crib gettin' ya shit right sprayin' yourself
With perfume that mean the dude start playin' yourself
Ya too fly to let ya friends know ya lovin' a nigga
So instead ya front like you ain't really fuckin' a nigga
But still I really love to sit on my dough
And there's nothin' I love when ya keep ya shit on the low

Return of the kitchen kid, with the axe

Million dollar merchandise, we on, get ya groove back
A hundred yukons, we all moving crack
All my soldiers got big rank, pa, Sicily money

Yo, what's happenin'? I heard you got the streets back, captain

Take your sweatpants off, fix your mascara
Four hundred nineteen ounces, out in Long Island
Twelve strong bitches that's real, who not scared of housing
Yes, throw on them raccoon, chinchilla feathers
Let it drag on my boots, the jean burned leather
Jog through the back of the building, drop the L
Got the scope on your nosey ass mother, fuckin' up sales
Forty karat locked in, bowtie, chillin' at the Democrat party
Yo, Chef, your coat, got it poppin'
Coming soon, Purple Tape, circle up the city let 'em know I'm back
Four hundred bricks, and yup, the kids stance
Sponsored by my cousin in Stan', maintainin'
Got the call from Tony Young Montana, my son campaignin'
Yup, I'm not no fuckin' bellboy, I war anything out there
The ring is mine, you can tell Roy
That's when I was hit with the call, your whole motto is get tour
Drug rap owner, you will rip all
Live like the pope, and get a big hall
Flipped them a claren, the front, like the Jag back like the store

Ill Vibe (LP version clean),UnKnown,UnKnown,"My rhymes profess life like the birds and the bees
Make Funk-Master Flex say yo I'm feeling these
Flows make you shit in your drawers. Change your dungarees
Smoking trees, getting cottonmouth, wild munchies
Bowed down the block eating food at Luigi's
Constipated...too much extra cheese
Well anyway, while I was cooling down at Luigi's
I met some Siamese twins from overseas...Lebanese
Let's begin with the friends from New Orleans
They had a fifth friend. She was straight Black-Portuguese
Pretty palm-olive-soaped skin, Aloe Vera-lese
She looked like the type of chick you only see in fantasies
The type of chick you would kill for to get between the knees
Yo. I made time to chill with Miss Portuguese
Would you believe, the bitch tried to steal my fucking house keys
And rob me for my G's
Had to show this crazy broad, I mastered my Degrees and my Ph.D.s
Got your face on camera; motherfucker say cheese
You better get with your friends quick, before I start to squeeze
Getting caught up in that freaky gold-digger Jamborees
I caught that ill vibe, Tip (Word, Bust?) Yo, yo, word
That ill vibe, Tip (Word, Bust?) Yo, yo, word

I got weight on my shoulders in the form of this beat
Ain't nothing sweet, on the street, for good these I compete
Come off complete
And you need to get back in your stance
We enhance and we're playing the whole world circumstance
So do good in your hood even though you puff life
Positive to comply
Don't screw up facing that crowd
Progress don't fall back. We can't have that
I'll hold your hand Black
We can't wind up with scratch
I put my best foot forward, when I play in life
Cause this world as I live it, chill's like a double edged knife
In the jam we regulate, cause we organize
Logically thinking when along's enterprise
A lot of brothers from the ghetto got the gift of gab
Peace to the West Coast and the East, we's fam
Need I make mention that the crew we've got
Make things get hot, like the FoFo shot. Blauw!
No we don't promote no guns, but don't turn that cheek
In the world that we live calmness is viewed as weak
So, we got to stay awake for all these lizards and snakes
Some of them come as friends; some of them come as Jakes
We decipher all the force and build rounds with our friends
Why's that?
So we can live right until time ends
Yo why's that?
I estimate, so we can get these ends
Yo true that?
Busta and Tip, you know we make minds bend

Everyday, me and my son stay scheming
On how to maximise the level on day to day creaming
While you remain faking
Yo, i ain't tolerating, no mistaking
We on the move to study paper-making
Round up the whole squad quick
Plot the scheme with my niggas, get on some full clip bullshit
Before i solidify manslaughter, my unit form on the streetcorner
We suprise like fiends in disguise
Laying for the right shit so i can receive another grand prize
Greeting niggas like a homeless nigga
The way it happened son, you'd never figure
How the homeless nigga gun is much bigger
Now give me everything you walking with and everything your man is holding
Even the watch that got the platinum moulding
And as the situation start unfolding
You scared to death you little bitch, go ahead
Report it stolen, see what happen...
(crazy fighting going on, mad punches, smashed glass etc.)
Cocks drwan nigga, holding my dick
Wilding for the night, splurging with my click from the fit
Open like a motherfucker, itching and ready to do the next stick
Get any my nigga dit can pick
What you said i said even if it causing bloodshed
Getting paid for even if we robbing a fucking chickenhead
Word to mother son, i ain't fronting
I'm taking everything i been always wanting
So i continue to peep out, in the jam will be the most blidded
Rob 'em in the corner bounce to the bar with they money and buy drinks with
It
I stay on some real trife shit, test your life shit or even stab you on some
Knife shit
Fake it if you wanna fake it, if i see it, then i want it, then i take it
Leaving niggas ass naked
Sometime i know it seems so shocking
How you the next victim to be listening of the sounds of a trigger cocking
All in your ears, cold steel all against your face
I feel your blood chilling, your heart racing at a rapid pace
And if you thinking that's strong
I dare you even to flinch wrong, fuck around
You feel the full five long
The victim contemplating what to do
Or how the fuck top get out of the situation that he's going through
This nigga tried to grab the gat, you know i started clapping
Bet y'all niggas wanna know how the rest of the story happened...

Daddy, can I sing this song, please?
Thank you
Hush other rap for niggas, don't you cry
Flip Mode is back & you are gonna die
Now they are niggas & they make it sound good
It can be alot safer, when they move off the hood
It's too late for you to try to call a truce
You tell him & your nigga like the cipher on lose
Better watch your head
You better watch how you talk
Watch me sleep, watch me walk
Always beware of a choice you make
Every time you click every route you take

Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Jah and Busta-Bus
Jaheim and Busta baby
Jah and Busta baby, oh
Yeah, wife in law, my bitch for the triflin' whore
Type of bitch to make a nigga get the right things for
Bitch sexy, and beautiful, and gangsta, and golden
Love to fuck a nigga till the pussy dry and swollen
My lil' bitch had a figure like a wine glass
Slim bitch stackin' like a motherfucker with a fine ass
Word to mother, bitch nasty like me
Love to fuck a nigga in places where people could see
The bitch tongue send a chill like cold freezin' a nigga
The way she holdin' and bitin' and suckin' and squeezin' a nigga
Down and dirty bitch never dick teasin' a nigga
Got her own paper and focused on pleasin' a nigga
She ain't out for gettin' a nigga or fuckin' my life
She only wanna fuck a nigga while he fuckin' his wife
There was nuttin' she couldn't achieve
In the mornin' bitch was across the street waitin' for wifey to leave
Called me on the cell while the wife was runnin' a bath
She can't wait for me to fuck her, till I cum in her ass
Just a long-time chick I used to fuck from the past
She love to out-fuck a nigga, see how long I could last
It be nice the way she always let me dig in her rib
The bitch fuck a nigga like she wanna move in my crib
Bitch I always knew ya ass was a star
In the daytime, whippin' the drop top, givin' me head in my car
When a woman needs love, just like you do
Oh, don't kid yourself, into thinkin' that you don't
'Cuz she will fool around, just like you do
Oh, don't kid yourself, into thinkin' that she won't
C'mere bitch and place ya pussy right where it belong
And put me in the mood to fuck just like a Jodeci song
I love the little freaky shit you be approachin' me on
Dick all in ya mouth, you know what type of shit I be on
The way the pussy lock feel like we about to be stuck
All outside busy, givin' me the balcony fuck
Hold on get up off of me quick
Bitch grab the X.O. and suck the Hennessey up off of my dick
So quick, so fast, bitch'll come out her skirt
Fuck a nigga till it hurt, while the wifey at work
The bitch'll even call her girl so I can fuck with her friend
And fall asleep to wake up and start fuckin' again
Straight nasty little bitch no horsin' around
The bitch even want me to fuck her when she walkin' around
Hold up, it's kinda ill how we be workin' the caper
She ain't only good for pussy, she be givin' me paper
Wife in law, my bitch be always keepin' it raw
Always slidin' out before the wifey walk in the door
They way she fuck me on straight for the night
Wifey still ain't make it home, I wonder if she workin' late for tonight
Wifey actin' funny style but I ain't fuckin' with that
She ain't call the crib so I wonder where wifey was at
Hm shit kinda had me buggin' before
But now I laugh because wifey had a husband in law
When a woman needs love, just like you do
Oh, don't kid yourself, into thinkin' that you don't
'Cuz she will fool around, just like you do
Oh, don't kid yourself, into thinkin' that she won't
When a woman needs love, just like you do
Oh, don't kid yourself, into thinkin' that you don't
'Cuz she will fool around, just like you do
Oh, don't kid yourself, into thinkin' that she won't

Starving nigga, fuck that, I'm a broke nigga
And I gotta see any nigga out here holding something
Fuck that
Everyday, me and my son stay scheming
On how to maximise the level on day to day creaming
While you remain faking
Yo, I ain't tolerating, no mistaking
We on the move to study paper-making
Round up the whole squad quick
Plot the scheme with my niggas, get on some full clip bullshit
Before I solidify manslaughter, my unit form on the streetcorner
We suprise like fiends in disguise
Laying for the right shit so I can receive another grand prize
Greeting niggas like a homeless nigga
The way it happened son, you'd never figure
How the homeless nigga gun is much bigger
Now give me everything you walking with and everything your man is holding
Even the watch that got the platinum moulding
And as the situation start unfolding
You scared to death you little bitch, go ahead
Report it stolen, see what happen...
(Crazy fighting going on, mad punches, smashed glass etc.)
Cocks drwan nigga, holding my dick
Wilding for the night, splurging with my click from the fit
Open like a motherfucker, itching and ready to do the next stick
Get any my nigga Dit can pick
What you said I said even if it causing bloodshed
Getting paid for even if we robbing a fucking chickenhead
Word to mother son, I ain't fronting
I'm taking everything I been always wanting
So I continue to peep out, in the jam will be the most blidded
Rob 'em in the corner bounce to the bar with they money and buy drinks with
It
I stay on some real trife shit, test your life shit or even stab you on some
Knife shit
Fake it if you wanna fake it, if I see it, then I want it, then I take it
Leaving niggas ass naked
Sometime I know it seems so shocking
How you the next victim to be listening of the sounds of a trigger cocking
All in your ears, cold steel all against your face
I feel your blood chilling, your heart racing at a rapid pace
And if you thinking that's strong
I dare you even to flinch wrong, fuck around
You feel the full five long
The victim contemplating what to do
Or how the fuck top get out of the situation that he's going through
This nigga tried to grab the gat, you know I started clapping
Bet y'all niggas wanna know how the rest of the story happened...

Go 'head and spaz on 'em (SHAKE IT LIKE A DOG FOR 'EM)
Now put the mash on 'em (SHAKE IT LIKE A DOG FOR 'EM)
Okay; now from the root to the tree to the top of the building
See they ain't fuckin with me killa (hit 'em)
Boom bap as far as you can see, got 'em bouncin and hoppin
Nigga you can't stop me scrilla (hit 'em)
Well okay; and if you with me say it (DO-DOH-DOHHHHH, DO-DOH-DOH)
I wanna hear my muh'fuckers say it (DO-DOH-DOHHHHH, DO-DOH-DOH)
A lil' louder muh'fuckers say it (DO-DOH-DOHHHHH, DO-DOH-DOH!)
C'mon; a lil' louder nigga, say it (DO-DOH-DOHHHHH, DO-DOH-DOH!!!!)
Yeah - well okay; and while you niggas party shit I spit a jewel for the thug
Before a nigga try to front make sure your tool in the club
That ain't the basis of this shit, though it's true when it's love
They'll have you niggas whylin like a fuckin fool on the drug
Now if you with me muh'fucker (get down!)
Uh-huh; we gettin gizzle muh'fucker (get down!)
Word to God; we make it sizzle muh'fucker (get down!)
Uh-huh; I'm on my grizzle holla back (OWWW!)
Well okay; see how the God bounce back while you niggas just sound sloppy
Givin you niggas shit they'll be knowin you can't copy
The way the God be spillin all over the track
Get off my dick, tell your bitch holla back (OWWW!)
C'mon; violate with me up in the spot is a no-no
A lot of niggas shit trash, soundin all so-so
Shinin so much D's takin my photo
Lower the brim of my fitted while I try to be low-pro
We gettin mo' cheddar while you stuntin with no dough
Gotta skip the line shit movin in slow-mo
Shorty whylin out, try to hit with a low blow
With her crotch on my thigh, rubbin all on her cho-cho
SHAKE YO' SHIT 'til you fall on the flo'
Sho' we be fuckin class bitches, I ain't fuckin with no hoe
Bust two shots - let me hear it (BO! BO!)
'Til the security get para' when they callin the po'-po'
If you with me say it (DO-DOH-DOHHHHH, DO-DOH-DOH)
I wanna hear my muh'fuckers say it (DO-DOH-DOHHHHH, DO-DOH-DOH)
A lil' louder muh'fuckers say it (DO-DOH-DOHHHHH, DO-DOH-DOH!)
C'mon; a lil' louder nigga, say it (DO-DOH-DOHHHHH, DO-DOH-DOH!!!!)
