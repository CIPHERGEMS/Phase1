Sound of da Police,Return of the Boom Bap,1993.0,"Woop-woop! That's the sound of da police
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da beast
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da police
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da beast (Yes indeed)
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da police
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da beast
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da police
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da beast (Yes indeed)

Stand clear, Don man'll talk
You can't stand where I stand, you can't walk where I walk
Watch out, we run New York
Policeman come, we bust him out the park
I know this for a fact, you don't like how I act
You claim I'm sellin' crack
, 
but you be doin' that
I'd rather say see ya, ‘cause I would never be ya
Be an officer? You wicked overseer!
You hotshot, wanna get props and be a savior
First show a little respect, change your behavior
Change your attitude, change your plan
There could never really be justice on stolen land
Are you really for peace and equality?
Or when my car is hooked up, you know you wanna follow me
Your laws are minimal
‘Cause you won't even think about lookin' at the real criminal
This has got to cease
‘Cause we be getting hyped to the sound of da police

Woop-woop! That's the sound of da police
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da beast
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da police
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da beast

Now here's a likkle truth, open up your eye
While you're checkin' out the 
boom-bap
, check the exercise
Take the word 
overseer
, like a sample
Repeat it very quickly in a crew, for example
Overseer, overseer, overseer, overseer
Officer, officer, officer, officer
Yeah, 
officer
 from 
overseer
You need a little clarity? Check the similarity!
The overseer rode around the plantation
The officer is off, patrollin' all the nation
The overseer could stop you, ""What you're doing?""
The officer will pull you over just when he's pursuing
The overseer had the right to get ill
And if you fought back, the overseer had the right to kill
The officer has the right to arrest
And if you fight back they put a hole in your chest
(Woop!) They both ride horses
After 400 years, I've got no choices
The police them have a likkle gun
So when I'm on the streets, I walk around with a bigger one
(Woop-woop!) I hear it all day
Just so they can run the light and be upon their way

Yes indeed
Yes indeed
Yes indeed
Yes indeed

Woop-woop! That's the sound of da police
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da beast
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da police
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da beast

Check out the message in a rough stylee
The real criminal are the C-O-P
You check for undercover and the one P.D
But just a mere Black man, them wan' check me
Them check out me car, for it shine like the sun
But them jealous or them vexed, ‘cause them can't afford one
Black people still slaves up 'til today
But the Black police officer nyah see it that way
Him want a salary, him want it
So he put on a badge and kill people for it
My grandfather had to deal with the cops
My great-grandfather dealt with the cops
My great-grandfather had to deal with the cops
And then my great, great, great, great—when it's gonna stop?!

Woop-woop! That's the sound of da police
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da beast
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da police
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da beast
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da police
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da beast
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da police
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da beast

Yes indeed
Yes indeed
Yes indeed
Yes indeed

Woop-woop! That's the sound of da police
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da beast
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da police

Step Into a World (Rapture’s Delight),I Got Next,1997.0,"Step into a world (Klaka klaka, klaka klaka)
Where there's no one left (Buku, buku! Alla de massive)
But the very best (Klaka, bo bo, BDP crew, bo bo bo bo)
No MC can test (but one, one, one)
Step into a world, where hip-hop is me
Where MC's and DJ's
Build up their skills as they play every day for the, rapture
Yeah, what what

Yes yes y'all, ya don't stop, KRS-One, rock on
Yes yes y'all, ya don't stop, KRS-One, rock on

I'm bout to hit you with that traditional style of cold rockin'
Givin options for head knockin non-stoppin'
Tip-toppin' lyrics we droppin' but styles can be forgotten
So we bring back the raw hip-hoppin'
Just like the records and tapes you be coppin'
Cop some breakdancin', boogie poppin', and lockin'
Tic tockin', guaranteed to have you clockin'
We only get better and only better we have gotten
This type of flow don't even think about stoppin'
Beware, the length of the rhyme flow can be shockin'
All music lovers in the place right now
That never understood the way that KRS got down
Yo, I'm strictly about skills and dope lyrical coastin'
Relying on talent, not marketing and promotion
If a dope lyrical flow is a must
You gots to go with a name you can quickly trust
I'm not sayin I'm number one, uhh I'm sorry, I lied
I'm number one, two, three, four and five
Stop wastin' your money on marketing schemes
And pretty packages pushin' dreams to the fiends
A dope MC is a dope MC
With or witout a record deal, all can see
And that's who KRS be son
I'm not the run-of-the-mill, cause for the mill I don't run

Yes yes y'all, ya don't stop, KRS-One, rock on
Yes yes y'all, ya don't stop, KRS-One, rock on

No MC can test (but one, one, one)
Step into a world, where hip-hop is me
Where MC's and DJ's
Build up their skills as they play every day for the, rapture

Everybody on the mic in the party sound alike
Until I recite, in black and white what's right
Let me take flight, my style is TIGHT AN GOOD
TIGHT AN GOOD, come is it TIGHT AN GOOD
Old styles I pass dat, slow down on fast rap
All in yo' ass crack, Cocaine? Don't pass dat
Conjure to ask dat, hyper type of flashback
I publish like ASCAP lyrics for hand clap
No past rappin', youth trackin', talent lackin'
MC's more worried about their financial backin'
Steady packin a gat as if something's gonna happen
But it doesn't, they wind up shootin they cousin, they buggin'
I appear everywhere and nowhere at once
I know my style is bumpin, even though some people front
It's the God of rap, you heard of it
The one that rhymes toward the sky givin airplanes mad turbulence
In rap tournaments, I reign permanent
Don't you think by now the number one spot I'm not concerned with it
The course of rap I'm turnin' it
Back to that good old fashioned way of getting cash money by earning it
No bogus hocus pocus, I bring back to focus
Skills if you notice my position is lotus
Now quote this, MC's are just hopeless
Thinkin record sales make them the dopest

Yes yes y'all, ya don't stop, KRS-One, rock on
Yes yes y'all, ya don't stop, KRS-One, rock on

MC’s Act Like They Don’t Know,KRS-One,1995.0,"Clap your hands everybody, if you got what it takes
'Cause I'm KRS and I'm on the mic, and Premier's on The Breaks
Goin' out to the hardcore hip hop
Goin' out to the hardcore hip hop
Of course we don't flip flop

If you don't know me by now I doubt you'll ever know me
I never won a Grammy, I won't win a Tony
But I'm not the only MC keepin' it real
When I grab the mic to smash a rapper, girls go, ""Ill""
Check the time as I rhyme, it's 1995
Whenever I arrive the party gets liver
Flow with the master rhymer, as I leave behind
The video rapper, you know, the chart climber
Clapper, down goes another rapper
Onto another matter, punch up the data, Blastmaster
Knowledge Reigns Supreme Over Nearly Everybody
Call up KRS, I'm guaranteed to rip a party
Flat top, braids, bald heads or knotty dreads
There once was a story about a man named Jed
But now Jed is dead, all his kids instead
Want to kick rhymes off the top of they head
Word, what go around come around I figure
Now we got white kids callin' themselves niggas
The tables turned as the crosses burned
Remember You Must Learn
About the styles I flip and how wild I get
I go on like a space age rocket ship
You could be a mack, a pimp, hustler or player
But make sure live you is a dope rhyme sayer

MCs act like they don't know
MCs act like they don't know
MCs act like they don't know

This is what you waited all year for
The hardcore, that's what KRS is here for
Big up Grand Wizard Theodore, gettin' ill
If you see then ya saw I'm in your grill with mad skill
MC's can only battle with rhymes that got punchlines
Let's battle to see who headlines
Instead of flow for flow let's go show for show
Toe for toe, yo, you better act like you know
Too many MC's take that word 'emcee' lightly
They can't Move a Crowd, not even slightly
It might be the fact that they express wackness
Let me show ya whose ass is the blackest
I flip a script a little bit, you ride the tip and shit
Too sick to get with it, admit you bit, your style is counterfeit
Now tone it down a bit
My title you will never get, I'm too intelligent
I'll send your family my sentiments, my style is toxic
When I rock and shock and hip hop it unlock your head, I knock it
It split quick from the lyric
Direct hit, perfect fit, you can't get with it

MCs act like they don't know
MCs act like they don't know
MCs act like they don't know

Some MC's don't like the KRS but they must respect him
Cos they know this kid gets all up in they rectum
Slappin' and selectin' em, checkin' em, disrespectin' em
Just deckin' em, deckin' em, deck-in' em
Who in their right mind can mimic a style like mine
I design rhyme and get mine all the time
MC's standin' on the sidelines, always dissin'
When I roll up and rush their crew, they start bitchin'
I don't burn, I don't freeze, yet some MC's
Believe they could tango with the likes of these
Cross your t's and dot your i's whenever I arrive
Wide, magnified, live like the ocean tide
You dope, you lied, I reside like Artifacts
On the Wrong Side of Da Tracks, electrified
Comin' around the mountain, you run and hide
Hopin' your defence mechanism can divert my heat-seeking lyricism
As I spark mad izm
The 1996 lyrical style's what I give 'em

MCs act like they don't know
MCs act like they don't know
MCs act like they don't know
MCs act like they don't know
MCs act like they don't know",https://genius.com/Krs-one-mcs-act-like-they-dont-know-lyrics
Hip Hop Vs. Rap,D.I.G.I.T.A.L.,1993.0,"You you can't can't be be ripping the mic the mic like do re me me
Measles are contagious like my lyrical pages
Ripping and flipping the mic
From back in the back in the days, these days it's kinda hectic, hectic
When these suckers don't respect it, check it
Flame on, I know the light is bright but keep on watching me
I'm stolen property, kicking the flavor to society
Police be clocking me, but logically they got to be
Cause they were taught that serious poetry would come from Socrates
But that ain't it, in 94 I'll kick the hit
If I was in front of Shakespeare, I'd battle the punk and take his shit
I'm not having it
Bust the narrative I come to give, listen
Rap is something you do, Hip Hop is something you live
The difference is kids nowadays, they got the video
Rappers don't need skills to build so they don't really know
Hear me yo, I'm four times on Arsenio
Got ten videos, but does that help me flow? No
That's why when I come to the show MC's act like they don't know
Cause they were too young to rock up in the disco
Frisco Disco, the disc is like a Nabisco
Chocolate chip cookie, don't fuck with me rookie
I'm rocking beats and with death defying feats
And I'm never squeaking, I'm always freaking when I'm speaking
Inside I'm keeping a statement for police and
I'm down for peace and but not turn the other cheek and
So this DJ, he gets down
Mixing records while they go...
Round and round, round we go
Two years ago a friend of mine
And Flash is gonna rock your mind
Welcome to the terror dome
, the terror dome
I wonder if I take you home
E-F-F-E-C-T
A cool operator operating correctly
But back in the days I knew rap would never die
Too late baby bye bye in a batty boy head, head, head
Insane in the membrane
Take the train, take the train
M-E-T-H-O-D man...
...Hattan keeps on making it, Brooklyn keeps on taking it
We keep coming back with more and more hits
Party people
I came through the door, I said it before
Two years ago, super ho
If my train goes off the track
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up back, back
Back to the grill again, the grill again
Friends
How many MC's must get dissed?
Before somebody says don't fuck with Kris
Hey! Ho!
 
Keep on moving don't stop no...
...Body beats the Biz
Let's do the dance called the Pee Wee Herman
Hey, Erick Sermon, hey
You you get off my cloud
Go down baby, go down baby
The gods must be crazy
You ain't fresh, you ain't fresh, yeah",https://genius.com/Krs-one-hip-hop-vs-rap-lyrics
A Friend,I Got Next,1997.0,"The beat was supposed to drop right there
The beat was supposed to drop right there
The beat was supposed to drop right there
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh!

I send this one out to my right hand man, or mens
Or womens, the whole crew, the real fam

We can count the dough or kick a flow
Or chill out watchin' videos
Or actin' really silly, yo, but really, though
All that can end
Whether at the bar with superstars
Or cruisin' in the trooper car
I really don't care who you are
All I really need is a friend

If we can't have trust, then you can't hang with us
We respond to those who show respect with respect
We respond, we connect on the same deck
Same intellect, my man, never shifty, thinks quickly
If you can't understand, we boys, we boys
We could stand on the corner with a hat sellin' toys
It ain't about your Benz, I hope it ain't about mine
My man, I be dissin' in my freestyle rhyme
Gettin G's around the world, I can trust you with my girl, my man
We chillin' at the jam, what's the plan?
I'm not a yes man and none of my friends are yes men
Or women, I'm drivin', I see my peeps yo get in
Where you fit in? True friends are quick to sit in the beginning of all trouble
And when your bankroll doubles
Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble
Still, I got my own space like Hubble

We can count the dough or kick a flow
Or chill out watchin' videos
Or actin' really silly, yo, but really, though
All that can end
Whether at the bar with superstars
Or cruisin' in the trooper car
I really don't care who you are
All I really need is a friend

Cause don't nobody care about us, all they do is doubt us
Until we blow the spot, then they all wanna crowd us
And wanna shout us, but you my man from way back
I just gots to say that, actin' large, I don't play that
But I can't say that, where I play at isn't fast-paced
A friend can acquire the taste to become two-faced
And that's a disgrace, there ain't nothing you can say to us
When the kid you grew up with betrays your trust
When we used to ride the bus, we had trust
Now we cash checks and drive Lex, and can't show respect to one of us
Yo, the heads I hang with ain't tryin to just get what they can get
Sit quickly backstabbin' the clique
I roll thick, but only some are friends really down to the end
My right hand men and women
Mutual support, from the beginnin'
Been in, exactly what I've been in

We can count the dough or kick a flow
Or chill out watchin' videos
Or actin' really silly, yo, but really, though
All that can end
Whether at the bar with superstars
Or cruisin' in the trooper car
I really don't care who you are
All I really need is a friend

Back to back, we attack corporate America
Gettin' fees that amount to G's in every area
You my man, I ain't gotta drag you along
You pull your own weight, yeah you definitely got it goin' on
I don't see nothin' wrong with a little bumpin' car system thumpin'
Between the crew, we always got somethin'
But if we had nothin', no frontin' whatever
We'd still be crew you and me, me for you together
Word, fake people ain't worth a turd
They only want to be your friend because of what they overheard
I send this record to the well respected
Friends that I've collected
I hope I am what you expected

So check it, so check it

We can count the dough or kick a flow
Or chill out watchin' videos
Or actin' really silly, yo, but really, though
All that can end
Whether at the bar with superstars
Or cruisin' in the trooper car
I really don't care who you are
All I really need is a friend",https://genius.com/Krs-one-a-friend-lyrics
AZTECHNICAL,Just Like That,UnKnown,"If you don't like what you singing, you sing a different hook
If you don't like what you cooking, you get a different cook
If you don't like what you wearing, you get a different look
You wanna escape Armageddon, read a different book
When knowledge is right there, we don't even look
December 2012 got this whole world shook
But look, the last days for others are the first days for us
The question to ask is who can you trust
Respect to all that 2012 stuff
But when you really study it it's fear, it don't apply to us
Yo, Hollywood lies to us, all day
The question is what does your culture say
Where's your culture at? Who's your prophet?
What history guides your spiritual logic?
It starts with a story, then it's hypnotic
Then any myth that comes along, you just adopted it
Why? Because your culture, you forgot it
December 2012, let's continue this topic
Turn the page, the present world age
Began 3114 BC
According to the Mayan calendar, this age concludes December 21st 2012 AD
This 5125 years cycle of calm is one world age
Nothing changes overnight, it's all a process
A transition, it happens over many days
In the Mayan calculation a K'in, is one day
The Mayan Winal, that's 20 days
The Tun is 360 days
A K'atun is 7200 days
The B'ak'tun is 144,000 days
And they applied that to the Milky Way
In the cycles they saw the Sun
Moving across the Milky Way's equator
Lining up with other galactic neighbors
We've been shifting for 30 years it seems
From 1980 to about 2016
The shift is now, it's occurring now
But if you're learning from the movies you won't know how to survive
Or stay alive after the storm
Cause after that a New World Order is born
Oh, you don't know, man? About they programs?
You still watching Lindsay, you don't see that low hand?
Let go, man, the flood is coming
Don't be scared, get prepared, keep your motor running
Rock with me

Higher level

Yep, it's all mass control, here's the philosophy
Cortés knew about the Aztec prophecy
Before he invaded their society
He studied their cultural psychology
He knew they had armor, guns, and steeds
So he arrived in the Aztec year 1-Reed
That's the year Quetzalcoatl
Was prophecized to return from exile in fact
Cortés played out the Aztec myth
And took away those people's will to resist
Cortés played on religious beliefs
And blinded the Aztecs, cause he was a thief
Look, the Yucatan, that's a Mayan book of cycles
It lets the Mayans know when the Gods are gonna strike you
In fact, every 13 K'atuns you see
The Mayans were visited with a catastrophe
So every 200 and 56 or 7 years
The Mayan people lived with this fear
So on the island of Tayasal now Flores
The Spanish came armed with this knowledge
They knew according to the Mayan heavens
That the next cycle was 1697
So as the Mayans stood there fixed on the heavens
The Spanish showed up with all of their weapons
March 13th, 1697
The Mayan people learned a terrible lesson
Your fears and tears are used against you
Cause 80% of world control is mental
But back to the Mayans, they getting some more
257 years after Tayasal
A US-backed coup overthrows their democracy in 1954
That's exactly 257 years from when the Spaniards arrived at their shores
I'm getting to the core of the lesson
Lets see what happens in 2211
That's the next cycle, that people remember
Like 2012, the 21st of December
The consciousness may shift, you may turn the light
But you are the universe, you're gonna be alright
The pole may shift, your soul may lift
To higher consciousness but you know all this
The Edutainment style will persist
Forget the fear, it's knowledge that runs all this",https://genius.com/Krs-one-aztechnical-lyrics
Outta Here,Return of the Boom Bap,1993.0,"""Boogie Down was performing, hey they ain't no joke""
""Down with the sound called B-D-P""

Back in the days I knew rap would never die
I used to listen to Awesome-2 on WHBI
I used to hear all kind of rap groups before sampling loops
Rappers wore bell-bottom Lee suits
Me and Kenny couldn't afford that
So we would go to the park when they was jammin' to hear rap
I used to listen till the cops broke it up
I always thought to myself ""Damn, why they fucked it up?""
But nevertheless I was in love with the microphone
And it stayed that way until I left home
On the streets of New York, now I'm free
But with freedom comes big responsibility
I used to walk around driven by the force
I remember how large Super Rhymes was when he fell off
I used to wonder about crews that used to rock
They were large, but none of them could manage to stay on top

Do you ever think about when you outta here?
Record deal and video outta here?
Mercedes Benz and Range Rover outta here?
No doubt BDP is old school, but we ain't goin' out!

After livin' on the streets alone
Some years went by, I signed myself into a group home
I used to watch the show ""I Dream of Jeannie""
And dreamt about ""When will I be large like Whodini?""
But I was messin' with graffiti on the subway
And gettin' chased by the cops almost everyday
I knew it had to bea better way see
So I would go to my room, blast RUN DMC
Around 1984 I left the group home, again alone
Still dreamin' about the microphone
Gimme a chance man, I know I can rock it
But I had to worry about puttin' money in my pocket
So when I reached the shelter I met my helper DJ Scott La Rock
And we both loved hip-hop
I was takin' suckas out in the shelter system
Yeah there was rappers in the shelter but I had to diss 'em
But all along, my vision was never lost
I kept seeing all these rap groups fallin' off

Do you ever think about when you're outta here?
Fly girl and fresh gear outta here?
Five-thousand dollar love seat outta here?
No doubt BDP is old school, but we ain't goin' out!

While I'm battling these rival crews
Yes, BDP would stay in the Street News
Some said, All they wanna do is battle
They can't write a song, so their careers won't last long!
Around this time I used to hang with Ced Gee
And DJ Scott La Rock used to buy gold with Eric B
I didn't meet Rakim till later with Scott
I remember we were jammin' at the rooftop
It used to irk me when these critics had opinions
Scott would say ""Just keep rappin', I'll keep spinnin'""
We had a fucked up contract, but we signed it
And dropped the hip-hop album Criminal Minded
We told the critics your opinions are bull
Same time Eric B and Rakim dropped Paid in Full
Hip-hop pioneers we didn't ask to be
But right then hip-hop changed drastically
People didn't wanna hear the old rap sound
We started samplin' beats by James Brown
In the middle of doin' ""My Philosophy""
Scott was killed and that shit got to me
But knowin' the laws of life and death
I knew his breath, was one with my breath
I had nothin' left and it was scary
So I dropped By All Means Necessary
Another hip-hop group that was a friend of me
Was a revolution crew called Public Enemy
It Takes A Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back
These two albums set off consciousness in rap
But all along, I'm still lookin' around
And all I can see are these rap groups fallin' down

Do you ever think about when you outta here?
Condominium and beach house outta here?
Credit cards and bank accounts outta here?
No doubt BDP is old school, be we ain't goin' out!",https://genius.com/Krs-one-outta-here-lyrics
Ah-Yeah,KRS-One,1995.0,"Ah yeah, that's whatcha say when you see a devil down
Ah yeah, that's whatcha say when you take the devil's crown
Ah yeah, stay alive all things will change around
Ah yeah, what, ah yeah

So here I go kickin' science in ninety-five
I be illin', parental discretion is advised still
Don't call me nigga, this MC goes for his
Call me God, cause that's what the black man is
Roamin' through the forest as the hardest lyrical artist
Black women you are not a bitch you're a Goddess
Let it be known, you can lean on KRS-One
Like a wall cause I'm hard, I represent God
Wack MC's have one style: gun buck
But when you say, ""Let's buck for revolution""
They shut the fuck up, can't get with it
Down to start a riot in a minute
You'll hear so many Bowe-Bowe-Bowe, you think I'm Riddick
While other MC's are talkin' bout up with hope down with dope
I'll have a devil in my infrared scope, WOY
That's for calling my father a boy and, ""klak, klak, klak""
That's for putting scars on my mother's back, BO
That's for calling my sister a ho, and for you
""Buck, buck, buck"", cause I don't give a motherfuck
Remember the whip, remember the chant
Remember the rope and
You black people still thinkin' about voting
Every President we ever had lied
You know, I'm kinda glad Nixon died

Ah yeah, that's whatcha say when you see a devil down
Ah yeah, that's whatcha say when you take the devil's crown
Ah yeah, stay alive all things will change around
Ah yeah, what, ah yeah

This is not the first time I came to the planet
But every time I come, only a few could understand it
I came as Isis, my words they tried to ban it
I came as Moses, they couldn't follow my Commandments
I came as Solomon, to a people that was lost
I came as Jesus, but they nailed me to a cross
I came as Harriet Tubman, I put the truth to Sojourner
Other times, I had to come as Nat Turner
They tried to burn me, lynch me and starve me
So I had to come back as Marcus Garvey, Bob Marley
They tried to harm me, I used to be Malcolm X
Now I'm on the planet as the one called KRS
Kickin' the metaphysical, spiritual, tryin' to like
Get with you, showin' you, you are invincible
The Black Panther is the black answer for real
In my spiritual form, I turn into Bobby Seale
On the wheels of steel, my spirit flies away
And enters into Kwame Ture

Ah yeah, that's whatcha say when you see a devil down
Ah yeah, that's whatcha say when you take the devil's crown
Ah yeah, stay alive all things will change around
Ah yeah, what, ah yeah

In the streets there is no EQ, no di-do-di-do-di-do
So I grab the air and speak through the code
The devil cannot see through as I unload
Into another cerebellum
Then I can tell em, because my vibes go through denim
And leather whatever, however, I'm still rockin'
We used to pick cotton, now we pick up cotton when we shoppin'
Have you forgotten why we buildin' in a cypher
Yo hear me kid, government is building in a pyramid
The son of God is brighter than the son of man
The spirit is, check your dollar bill G, here it is
We got no time for fancy mathematics
Your mental frequency frequently pickin' up static
Makin' you a naked body, addict and it's democratic
They press auto, and you kill it with an automatic

Ah yeah, that's whatcha say when you see a devil down
Ah yeah, that's whatcha say when you take the devil's crown
Ah yeah, stay alive all things will change around
Ah yeah, what, ah yeah",https://genius.com/Krs-one-ah-yeah-lyrics

Black cop!! Black cop black cop black cop
Stop shootin black people, we all gonna drop
You don't even get, paid a whole lot
So take your M-60 and put it 'pon lock!
Take your four-five and you put it 'pon lock!
Lookin for your people when you walk down a block
Here in America you have drug spot
They get the black cop, to watch the drug spot
The black drug dealer just avoid black cop
They're killin each other on a East Coast block
Killin each other on a West Coast block
White police, don't give a care about dat
Dem want us killin each other over crack
Anyway you put it it's a black on BLACK
Black cop black cop black cop
Black cop black cop black cop
Thirty years ago, there were no black cops
You couldn't even run, drive round the block
Recently police trained black cop
To stand on the corner, and take gunshot
This type of warfare isn't new or a shock
It's black on black crime again nonstop
Black cop!! Black cop black cop
Black cop black cop black cop
""Don't be the sucker..
Don't be the sucker comin into my face..
Don't be the sucker..""
Here's what the West and the East have in common
Both have black cops in cars profilin
Hardcore kids in the West got stress
In the East we are chased by the same black beast
The black cop is the only real obstacle
Black slave turned black cop is not logical
But very psychological, haven't you heard?
It's the BLACK COP killin black kids in Johannesburg
Whassup black cop, yo, whassup?!
Your authorization says shoot your nation
You wanna uphold the law, what could you do to me?
The same law dissed the whole black community
You can't play both sides of the fence
1993 mad kids are gettin tense
Black cop!! Black cop black cop black cop
Stop shootin black people we all gonna drop
You don't even get, paid a whole lot
Take your four-five and you put it 'pon lock!
Take your M-60 and put it 'pon lock!

9 Elements,Kristyles,2003,"Well my ladies and gentlemen
This is a rapsession and my name is ""KRS-One!""
And when I talk about ""Hip-Hop Music!"", I know

One : Breaking or breakdancing
Really b-boying, freestyle, street dancin'
Two : MC'ing or rap
Divine speech what I'm doing right now, no act
Three: Grafitti art or burning, bombin'
Taggin', writin', now you're learning! uh!
Four : 
DJ'ing
, we ain't playing!
{*scratch*} You know what I'm saying!
Five : 
Beatboxing
Give me a {*beatboxin*} Yes and we rockin'!
Six : Street fashion, lookin' fly
Catchin' the eye while them cats walk on by
Seven: 
Street language, our verbal communication
Our codes throughout the nation
Eight: 
Street knowledge, common sense
The wisdom of the elders from way back whence
Nine : Street entrepreneurialism
No job, just get up call 'em and get 'em
Here's how I'm tellin' it, all 9 Elements
We stand in love, no we're never failing it
Intelligent? No doubt
Hip-Hop? We're not selling it out, we're just lettin' it out
If you're checkin' us out this hour, we teatchin' hip-hop
Holy Integrated People Having Omnipresent Power!

Rap is something you do!
3x Hip-Hop is something you live! *scratched*
Rap is something you do!
Hip-Hop is something you live! *scratched*

Skaters, BMX-bike riders rock
Don't you ever stop! You are hip-hop
You doing the same things we did on our block in the suburbs
You know you be packing that black block
Selling that crackrock and ecstasy
Gettin' pissydrunk, fallin' out next to me
But like I told those in the ghettoes
Here's the facts! 
True hip-hop is so much more than that
Some much more than rap, so much more than beats
Hip-hop is all about victory over the streets
What you see on TV is a lie
That's not something you wanna live or pattern your life by
But, huh that's too much preachin' ain't it?
You don't want the edutainment, you wanna be dead on the pavement
Well, so be it, some of ya'll ain't gonna see it
Others wanna enslave your mind! Kris wanna free it!

Rap is something you do!
5x Hip-Hop is something you live! *scratched*
""Oh yea"" *scratched* --- From ""P is dead""
""I have spent my whole life livin'"", ""hip hop to the fullest"", ""no doubt""

You know that's why these rappers can't hang
Cause the essence of hip-hop is not a material thing
They so careless, hip-hop is in awareness we give
Rap we do, hip-hop we live
How many times I gotta say it? How long the radio ain't gonna play it
And you hip-hoppers sit back and okay it
Think about it! (think about it)
The present course of action, we have got to reroute it!

I Can’t Wake Up,Return of the Boom Bap,1993.0,"What I want you to do is count to ten
Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two
On one, you will be asleep - one

I'm a blunt gettin smoked and I can't wake up
I'm a blunt gettin smoked and I can't wake up
I'm a blunt gettin smoked and I can't wake up
I'm a blunt gettin smoked and I can't wake up

I'm dreamin.. about bein a blunt
I'm runnin around and I just can't wake up, hah!
I'm dreamin.. about bein a blunt, ho!
I'm walkin around and I just can't wake up

I'm tryin to wake up, I can't wake up
So I run and jump, someone yelled, ""Get that blunt!""
Get that blunt - now I'm thinking this is major
I've got a bunch of people chasin me with a razor?!
I don't like this dream as a blunt
But I can't get out of it and I can't seem to wake up
So I'm runnin and racin, blunt smokers are chasin
This is insane, I'm caught by House of Pain
I'm picked up, they said they gonna +Put My Head Out+
They slit my back and all the tobacco fell out
Now I'm hollowed wet thin and yes ready
They poured the shumpang gently and re-wet me
I'm in the mouth yo, I can't wake up
Yo I'm a blunt gettin smoked and I can't wake up


Check it out now, in the same attire here comes the fire
OW they lit it, now I'm burnin by the minute
But check it out, more heads came to chill
Everlast took a pull
 and 
passed me to Cypress Hill
Cypress Hill took a pull, lungs are full
Who's next? I'm bein passed to Das EFX
As they took a mad pull, smoke blows in heaps
It's really smoky but I can still see Black Sheep
Whoa! Black Sheep gets me, relights me
Room is proper, now I'm passed off to Shabba
Shabba's voice gets low like a tuba
He said, ""Me no follow no rumor""
 
and passed me to Grand Puba
I wasn't burnin right so Puba got mad at me
And said, ""Who rolled this?"" and passed it to Kid Capri
Kid Capri said, ""I won't front!
Pass it to Redman, he knows how to roll a blunt""
Redman said, ""No need to re-roll""
He hit, relit it, and passed me to De La Soul
De La Soul took a hit and kept hittin
Now they're buggin cause they passed me to Bill Clinton
Bill Clinton said, ""I'll smoke but I won't inhale
I'll only hit it twice,"" he got slapped by Greg Nice
Now I fell on the floor, Greg Nice picked me up
I'm bein smoked and I can't wake up


Get me out of this, somebody wake me up
I'm still on fire and I'm still bein smoked up
Half my body is gone, now they're comin to my head
Now my head is being pinched by Teddy Ted
A crazy nightmare I got to go
I got to wake up and 
I'm passed off to Yo-Yo
Yo-Yo gets respect as a lady
She didn't smoke,
 
she passed me to Showbiz & A.G
A.G. said, ""Respect due seen""
He got one big pull and passed me to Smooth B
Smooth B
, 
although he's talking to Teddy
Took a hit and passed me to Fab 5 Freddy
Freddy said, ""Yo! There's nothing left pop""
Looked at me in my face and passed me to Chubb Rock
Chubb Rock said, ""Yo Freddy chill!
If you ever catch me smoking, just kick me in the grill""

Of course all the hardcore heads
This one goes out to you
Crank up the volume one time
Peace to all the real DJs out there
Cause I don't send my music to no garbage DJs
They get me (mad)
So in the clubs I get (mad)
On the mic I get (mad)
On the beats I get (mad)

Yo, I got the

I'm with the

I be chillin' with the

I'm rollin' with the

See, this is what I'm sayin' and I know you don't see this
Wack, underpriveledged MCs think they can see Kris
They watchin' too much television and they rocka
This ain't the TV show ""Taxi,"" and I ain't Lotka
I break an MC off proper, yo don't check me
Ask your Moms and Pops, yo they respect me
But here you stand, tryin' to get yours, but gettin' NOTHIN'
You probably can't spell ""Boogie Down"" or ""Productions""
I play for jeeps, I play for keeps, I play for streets, believe me
Put down the microphone and consider a squeegee
You're rated PG
Again I win when I begin
I'm slammin' again, no win, try to comprehend
I don't bend
I ravage and damage
I'm wild like a savage, kickin' asses
Hot flashes, your style's with trash's
Stay out of my classes, punk
Stay out of my classes, yo


Twinkle, twinkle to the little rap star
I got all type of MC tongue in a pickle jar
So here's a quick freestyle to my target:
My core audience, *fuck* the rest of the market!
Cause I spark it, styles I loanshark it
Then break your legs if you try to chart it
I got heart, it
Doesn't take a lot to rock a record, get wit it
Some MCs can't rock for five minutes
Sorry, that's not the way to approach me
Use caution
I rip up lyrical crews and MCs often
You probably don't know this:
I give birth to MCs
And I also give abortions
I'll do a number to your body structure
You look like supper
And I'm that hungry motherfucker!
You don't wanna be on the menu!
I'll end you, twist you up and bend you
Like Gestapo
Pick up the microphone and crush up MC like a taco
No, we're never sad because we nah deal with sorrow
That's why dem challenge me, jah man you know dem challenge trouble
Me are number one of me there is no double!
And you don't want no trouble
Cause Blastmaster KRS is flashin' lyrics on the double


Check
Me comin' on quick, me comin' a dance, now me a sing
KRS-One in a party, man me do me own ting
Nuff MC test, but you don't hear vowel one
All you hear is when the BDP crew slap them up
We have the champion belt and lyrical cup
Any DJ they want my title filled, no way now man step up
But when you lose, now understand you get fucked up
This ain't no game upon the mic
Me bring the noise to you like Chuck


Kid Capri got the

Gang Starr got the

Ill Will got the

Just Like That,Just Like That,UnKnown,"You know, you don't see with your eyes
You see with your brain
And the more words your brain has
The more things you can see

Yes yes y'all, it don't stop, it can't stop, it won't stop
We used to be there rapping on the block
It was like hip-hop would never stop
But then we all got older, and a little bit bolder
The streets of New York got a little bit colder
I'm a young dude, I gotta learn and get over
1980, Brooklyn is crazy in the dark
But there I am in Wingate Park
Jamming to the DJs creating this art
I'm on E, but I'm free and I wanna be part
So I gotta be smart and then it just sparked
I'mma start with my heart, achieving the mark
Of being the number one MC on the chart
So on your mark get ready go
I Rock Steadied the show with DJ Scott La Rock, you already know
Yo, these were the days when bands were elected
Based on the jams they selected so check it
This man got respected
When fans detected that the South Bronx
Was the new answer record

And just like that, just like that, just like that
I speak into the air and
Just like that, just like that, just like that
My dreams they did appear so
Just like that, just like that, just like that
You speak into the air and
Just like that, just like that, just like that
Your dreams they will appear so

Just like that I was right on top
Me and Scott La Rock but then Scott La Rock got shot
I can hear him echoing: ""hip-hop don't stop""
But we was getting robbed like a bank with no lock
By a record company that was taking a lot
People blaming us and shaming us, but then it all stopped
When By All Means Necessary dropped
It was like the whole damn hip-hop culture stopped
But that's when the vultures dropped, from the culture shock
Because we was showing people how they supposed to rock
With their hands in the air and they mouth on scream
But in '81 this was just a dream
But we kept dreaming, kept decreeing, kept seeing
Kept being hip-hop, breaking, MCing
Graffiti writing, DJing on the weekend
It's the proper use of your mind I'm teaching


Just like that, I began to see
The true force and the power of M-I-N-D
Now I am free and yes I can be
The amazing MC I saw in 81
Back then I was the crazy one
Even the lazy one, the not sure, the maybe one
Now today I'm the sure one, the on tour one
The raw one, the one you want more from
But it was all a dream
Now this brother's on the cover of Word Up magazine
Hanging fliers on my wall
Boogie Down Productions vs MC Shan and Marley Marl
You know my tape rocks, I don't say pop
If I couldn't find OE, then I got the Private Stock
Way back where them Dapper Dan jackets at
With the hat to match, all that


Just like that, now it's '91
And the West Coast Era now has just begun
And you can't run, crack cocaine affects everyone
Now we know the military, they brought in several tons
Forget them old guns they brought in better ones
The name of this new game is stack your set of ones
For me I remember 1981
When I first wanted to rap it was mainly fun
But hip-hop was made to run
So them dudes that think it's all about money their day will come
And it comes for many, and it's scary
To learn your whole career was really temporary
But on the contrary we can look at the past
And see the major recording artists that didn't last
But here comes the blast, in order to last
Be the real you, man, take off the mask",https://genius.com/Krs-one-just-like-that-lyrics
The Truth,KRS-One,1995.0,"It's not natural If it goes against God
It's not factual Her truth is not hard
It's not natural If it goes against God
It's not factual Gimme the truth!
Listen to the lyric as the negative is shrinkin
It's shrinkin out your life when you decide to change your thinkin
One of the first things we gotta switch around of course
Is Jesus Christ, and him dying on the cross
You're looking at the cross, surrounded in it's mystery
With Jesus on the cross in a, total misery
Now seperate Jesus from the cross so you can see
The truth about the cross, and the cross's history
The cross was created by the Roman government
It's only purpose and use, is cap-i-tal punishment
But Jesus Christ, was all about the revolution
While the cross was used as Jesus Christ's execution
See what if Jesus Christ, was hung upon a tree
Upon every church wall, that's exactly what you'd see
If Jesus Christ, was shot in the head with no respect
We'd all have little gold guns around our neck
If Jesus Christ was killed in electic chair, now get it
You'd be knealing to the electric chair with Jesus, still in it
You gaze upon the cross, and you see the execution
You yell stop the violence but the cross you're still using
It's not natural If it goes against God
It's not factual Her truth is not hard
It's not natural If it goes against God
It's not factual Gimme the truth!
So I say listen, listen, open up your third eye vision
God is not down with religion
Religion they be sellin it, listen up, God is intelligent
Reading of the bible is irrelevant
You gotta look within yourself, not a scripture
KRS-One comes to rearrange the God picture
If you sit and believe, you can acheive
If you sit and accept, you don't know, what's correct
Or incorrect, take for instance Adam and Eve
The first two people on the planet, or so you believe
Their first time in heaven kids they had, Cain and Abel
Huh, now let me show you why the story's unstable
According to the story, according to what you believe
There was only Cain, Abel, Adam, and Eve
On the whole planet, now use your intellect
And tell me, what did Cain and Abel do for sex?
Upon the whole planet there was not another
Could it be for sex, heh, they were looking at each other?
Hold up! I thought the church wasn't into that
But wait, still yet, there is another fact
How did the world get populated?
Now tell me if I'm wrong, but obviously Eve had it goin on
Think for a minute, I know it gets notorious
But yo G, check out the chorus
It's not natural If it goes against God
It's not factual Her truth is not hard
It's not natural If it goes against God
It's not factual Gimme the truth!

Yo yo...
Yo bring that back
I wanna say something on this BlastMaster session
Yo this is Rich Nice
You brothers gotta stop treating these hoes like nice girls
And these nice girls like hoes

True indeed, I'd like to welcome the rebirth of the Goddess
Word up it's all about knowledge of self
Yo Busta Rhymes, why don't you take the session over from here",https://genius.com/Krs-one-the-truth-lyrics

Return Of The Boom Bap means just that
It means return of the real hard beats and real rap
The ladies in the place like it just like that
I'm a around the way guy with a baseball cap

See how it sounds(bo!) a little unrational(bo!) 

People always callin me a top celebrity
Cause when I'm on the mic
I like to speak freely
You hear me chattin' lyric but Im not an MC
A one poetic member of the crew B.D.P
I looked around the nation but I simply couldn't find
Another entertainer with a rhyme like mine
I pick up the mic and I tear up the phone
At this point in the party I should be left alone
But uh-oh uh-oh I've come to show
A brand new flow, is the flow wack? NO!

You add a little street in your r-a-p

Cause smashin' up a crew, one-two is the least
When a sucka wants to battle that just gets me geesed
I never backed down from to an MC feud
Never on stage KRS got booed
Stayed hardcore never changed my attitude
I got the hip-hop juice for the hip-hop food
I eat when I drink, an I drink when I eat
When I speak, what I speak, what I speak is not weak

Everytime you hear nigga, listen up sista

I met up with this girl named Delores, a prankster

But judge not, lest ye may be judged
For the judgment ye judge ye shall surely be judged, you gets no love

Sensation gives me inspiration of revolution
That's my solution, there will be no sequels
I'm audi hundred forty four thousand with my people
From Caligula to Hitler, now it's Schwarzenegger

Who enslaved ya (it's the Devil) but the God of virtuosity
And of the world created, could it be mental sodomy

Mama said don't do crack and smoke you know
Cause it will make your nose grow like Pinocchio
Since I was only 15 I had to listen
To what was said for my parent was a christian
I went to school and saw all my friends do it
But I said no cause I don't want my nose to grow
They started tripping on me, busting and flipping on me
So I had to front and say yo, true, stick it on me
I started smoking to prove I'm an adult
Now it's a habit but is it all my fault
I wished my mother would have told me the truth
Cause now I'm all based out, ma dukes

Oh man I like the way that's going down
Now what I want you to do is kick a little Freddie Foxx

Everybody rise as I present to a jet black crowd
What it's like to be black and proud
In a world where white is right but not tonight
This is a black man's mic
I heard a sister say she don't like darker shades of black
On a man cause that's whack
But to my light skin sister can't you tell
You're just the surface of a dark deep well
And how can you prefer to be wit those
That sprayed you wit gun and hoses
And never put roses on the graves
Of the slaves that they treated like dirt
After all that hard work

Clap your hands to the beat, C'mon, just clap your hands to the beat
Freak it now

One of the biggest lies you hear from no one else
Is when a girl tries to say she don't do it to herself
Always fantasizing but steadily denying
Last night she had to stop cause her baby was crying
She do it on the phone all alone wit a smile
Run the water, grab the shower cap and 
get buckwild
Soap suds on the floor, oh Al B Sure
Give it to me, give it to me, give me a little more
I'm fiending, creaming, screaming, dreaming (what else)
The girl's possessed by the basehead demon


In Elementary, Lyte had the Jordache look
Like me and any other kid who cared about books
But then I got wise and I begin to listen
To the whack teachers and the wick-wack system
My mother put me in Weusi Shule
Which means black school in Swahili
And there is where I learned black history
And how to be the best that I can be
I went back and now the school is closed
There is nowhere for black youth to go
To be taught by brothers and sisters who knows what it means
To be a black child or a white teen
In the end the youth is being mistreated
Which means the world is being cheated

Dane was never taught her life was worth something
But when people don't try to improve it makes me want to hurt something
You want to be somebody and be a standout
But got your handout, oh you're broke, I guess it's off to your man's house
Why is sister's giving up the bod
Today it seems not to father you too hard
They call us skeezers and you prove it to the worst
Hon, you have to earn the right to say it's ladies first

Oh man this is Human Education Against Lies
You better know the flavor kid

Human Education Against Lies tries
To open the eyes of humanity before it dies
Black and white ain't the real fight
That's the only thing the media hypes
The real fight are these major corporations
Holding back on real education
Before you're a color, first you're human
Teaching humanity is what we're doing

And just when you thought you knew everything there was to know
You didn't know anything about this, tell 'em Melodie

Daddy's home everyday since he lost his job
His new line of work is now beating up mom
Mom is scared, she doesn't know what to do
Her beautiful skin is now black and blue
She used to cry, now she's Packin' A Pan
A human war between woman and man

Melodie, Kid Capri

JMJ all the way, yo
Human Education Against Lies
To all the girls and to all the guys
Get paid, get it made
Get a good grade, live to a very old age
Check it out check, no disrespect
To each and every member of the opposite sexes
Yes, listen to the messages and I send some
We never knew where the poison came from
Yo, we're rapping on H.E.A.L. so we thought we like to mention
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome
AIDS, we're here to make you get wise

Higher Level,Return of the Boom Bap,1993.0,"After seven years of rockin', how do you rate me?
Poorly or greatly? Everybody seems to be goin' for their's lately
Yo mad heads be needin' money
So listen very close as I conduct this little study
See it's, funny to me, you can watch TV
And give up your life trying to be all you can be in the Army
Not knowin' your history, you either fight and die or come back home in misery
Yo get with me, I deal with reality
Loosen your mind to the truth, and don't get mad at me
No politician can give you peace
If you trust Jesus, why do you vote for a beast?
Emancipation is long over due
So overcome procrastination
Because freedom is within you
For some reason we think we're free
So we'll never be, because we haven't recognized slavery
You're still a slave, look at how you behave
Debatin' on where and when and how and what Massa gave
You wanna know how we screwed up from the beginning?
We accepted our oppressor's religion
So in the case of slavery it ain't hard
Because it's right in the eyes of THEIR God
Where is our God: the God that represents us
The God that looks like me; the God that I can trust
A God of peace and love; not mass hysteria
I don't want a God that blesses America
I could never really vote for the devil
Let me take you to a higher level

Title, take the title from the Bible we can get there
Rip the title from off the front of the Bible, God don't live there
Too many inconsistencies, too many mysteries
Picture the Pope and the Vatican, laughing and drinking and singing and kissing me
I stand with God whether I'm paid or whether I'm cryin' broke
I like to ask these politicians would Jesus vote?
The way we view God is a freakin' shame
Church is to blame. We trust God, but bomb Hussein
We simply lovin' the scripture, same scripture that whipped 'cha
Sooner it'll hit 'cha, religion's gettin' richer
With that European version of Christ made into a picture
Our society's gettin' sicker, and sicker, and sicker...
Like liquor, we are God-Intoxicated
Not to the true God, but the one the government created
The same governments tellin' people to vote
I pray to God because the people have lost hope
You either vote for the mumps or the measles
Whether you vote for the lesser of two evils, you vote for evil
Politics and God are not equal
But the education if you don't guard, is really lethal
People have more respect for a holy book
Than they do for a cow on a meat hook
Believers of Jesus be denouncing Satan on every level
But every Halloween they're dressin' like devils
I pray to you for the light you might give them
Mother make them know that you're livin' within them
You begin them and end them in silence
Frankly, if they knew you, they would understand violence
I pray to you for the Pope and the Vatican
Have mercy Mother, cause I know that you're mad at them
The White Jesus deceived us awhile ago
And Pope Julius the Second paid Michelangelo
I know this happened in 1519 yet
This is the image we can't seem to forget
Vote for God, don't vote for the Devil
Let me take you to a higher level",https://genius.com/Krs-one-higher-level-lyrics
The MC,I Got Next,1997.0,"Okay (Teacha), I've got one question (Yeah)
One question (Yo, Cali) Who am I?

The MC, la-di da-di
I don't wear Versace, I wear DJ's out quickly at the party
Who am I? If you're like me, hip-hop is in your body
Who am I? THE MC
When the jam is slow and you need a proceeder
Who am I? THE MC
When you need a lyrical leader wit oratorical triple features
Who am I? THE MC
When you need to rock your 3000-seat arena, best believe, uh
Who am I? THE MC
When you need to get the word on the street wit' demeanor

I beg thee, let me splurt rhymes, I have plenty
Who am I? THE MC, Lord have mercy

Always New like Jersey, stay thirsty

Showin' my authority, superiority
An artistic minority, now you startin' me
'Cause party philosophy can only be carried out by

No doubt, predicting far ahead what will set the party off immensely
With plenty of who? THE MC

Control your subconscious magnet from pullin' in havoc

Non-stoppin' MC, hip-hoppin' MC
Verbal rockin', head knockin', quick droppin' MC
I laugh 'cause I mastered the craft MC
In sound clash I'm the first and last MC

I black out and wake up to catastrophe
Three MC's dead from the sound blowin' out massively, wow
Who am I? The MC
Untouchable, can't be caught off guard with fast tracks or slow tracks
Ass cracks get waxed to the max, MC's pack raps for all tracks
Indigenous cultures, Asians, Whites and Blacks
Never missed it the linguistic of
Who am I? THE MC
Meta-lyrical, poetic, mystic MC
Hearin' the voice of an ancient spirit MC
Premeditated worder
Killin' negative concepts out the mind of the observer, MC
You deserve a break from counterfeits, frauds and fakes
Claimin' to be an MC, for Heaven's sake
Well, this MC done raised the stakes
Under the stress of KRS, contracts and mental gaps are bound to break

"Can’t Stop, Won’t Stop",I Got Next,1997.0,"Open a de herb gate sellin pure ganja
Babylon come but they undercova
They never really want me stop sell ganja
(They just wanna take a cut of what you make so far!)
But I'm not havin it, I load the SLR
Pack the ganja BOOM! They break down the door
Pop-pop! T'ree shots, exchanged at close range
Out of three Babylon, me hit one in the brain
Pop-pop! Two shots hit da window pane
I exchanged four shots, I drop and feel pain
But I'm not hit, into the bathroom I crawl
I look out the window, it's a one story fall
I'm fallin, hit the ground and start crawlin
Soon I'm walkin 'round, blendin in with the crowd
Another day, I got away, I gotta fix this problem someday
But the very next day...

Can't stop, won't stop - sellin mad izm
All comeptition - I gots to get with 'em
Me nah go jail and me nah go prison
(Take it to his face kid, diss him!)

I'm in another herb gate like a superstar
Eleven A.M., things are safe so far
I used to worry 'bout the competition on the block
But now the competition on the block is the cops
And even block watch doesn't know where we lay
Well.. (""Open up! It's the D.E.A.!"")
Aww man, just when I went for more lead
The door opens up, I got a Glock to my forehead
(""Get down! Get on the floor!"") I felt the stick, I thought I was dead
But I woke up instead in a cell layin on my bed
I lay back down, then I heard the crack sound
Two D.T.'s came in and laid they Glocks down
One was whistlin a love song, as he put some gloves on
I thought to myself, damn something's wrong
Boom bap! Boom bap against my head
I fell back on the bed, down to his feet
The pain was insane but the hit was sweet
Cause these dumb-ass cops punched me right by the heat
The Glock, two shots, three shots they screamin
Then someone said... (""Hey wake up kid, you're dreamin!"")
I said, ""Yo dreamin?! That nightmare was hell""
But as I look around, I was still in my cell
Damn, I got myself caught up in a jam
The D.T. that woke me up was like, WHAT?!
I wiped the saliva, off my mouth
The D.T. said.. (""Let's make a deal"") No doubt!
No question, now we started up the session
No need for guessin, yes they want my supplier
I said, what makes you think there's anyone higher?
He said.. (""Don't be a God damned liar!"")
You killed three D.T.'s yesterday, you heard me
But still the cops you knocked off yea was dirty
Now the whole investigation is federal
We want you to point out, the rest of the cops that are criminal
He continued to say, you can't think it through
This whole drug game is BIGGER than you!
Follow our plan man and you'll be free
Let me explain one thing so you can see, we


Now I'm back in the herb gate, all wired up
Constantly thinkin about bein tied up
Snap out of it - I'm thinkin, ""Damn we like elves!
The federal and local cops got wars with themselves;
And I'm in the middle, and can't solve the riddle
My nose is runny.."" {*knock at door*} (""Let me get a 20!"")
A 20 of the green or a 20 of the brown?
(""Gimme the whole pound, clown, or duck down!"") {*gunfire*}
God damn, God damn, here we go again
But this time I'm set up by my federal friend
Suddenly I hear.. (""Yo, move from the door!"") {*two shots*}
Followed by the shot sounded like a four-four {*two shots*}
After the violence, then there was silence
Then I heard.. (""Hey yo it's us, open up the door!"")
But rule number one in this game is self-reliance
So I picked up the mini-mac in case they wanted more
The door opened up, the feds said WHATTUP?
They was stickin you up, so they had to get bucked
Suddenly a sense of trust came over me
I thought to myself, ""Well soon I'll be free!""
But as I turned around, I heard the gun go click {*clik-clak*}

The World Is MIND,The World Is MIND,2017.0,"You know
Whatever the brain doesn't have a word for it can't see
I teach you this all the time
The world is mind
M-I-N-D

There were two patients laying in the hospital
They shared the same room, both fighting health obstacles
The first patient had his bed by the window
He could see outside and feel how the wind blow
The second patient, his bed was by the wall
No window, he couldn't see nothing at all
So in summary there was no sun to see
He was laying in the dark looking for recovery
He could see the other patients looking outside
And jealousy took over his pride, he couldn't hide
He said to the patient by the window
""Hey! Tell me what you see outside there today""
The patient by the window started saying
""I see people walking, talking, I see children playing""
""Cars going by with the booming systems""
But the patient by the wall could only lay and listen
Bedridden, he couldn't see it for himself
But the descriptions he was given was improving his health
Everyday the patient by the window would say what he saw
And everyday the patient by the wall wanted more
But what he wanted even more instead
Was to be in the patient by the window's bed
He wanted the same bed that the patient had
If he could just exchange beds it would make him glad
So one day the patient by the window was gone
And the patient by the wall knew something was wrong
But he still asked the nurse if he could be first
To get the bed by the window, and what's worse
He did get the bed by the window
But the shock instead was a wall full of brick stone
No cars, no people, no scenery
No light, no flowers, no greenery at all
It was like just a brick wall facing the window
He said to the nurse ""I was tricked, yo""
The nurse said ""Tricked? You'll be fine""
But a view of a brick wall he didn't have in mind
And what really blew his mind
Is when the nurse said, ""Cheer up
The previous patient, he was blind""
He realized right at that time
You create your reality, the world is mind",https://genius.com/Krs-one-the-world-is-mind-lyrics
Hip Hop Knowledge,The Sneak Attack,2001,"You know.. life is funny..
If you don't repeat the actions of your own success
You won't be successful
You gotta know your own formula, your own ingredients
What made you, YOU..
1987 I was at the 
Latin Quarters
Listenin to Afrika Bambaata give the order
The call of the order was to avoid the slaughterA
He said, ""Record companies ain't got nuttin for ya!""
Without a lawyer, he taught The Infinity Lessons
In how hip-hop could be a, many a blessing
And that was great, so in 1988
There was no debate, we had to end the hate
The name of the game was ""Stop the Violence""
And unity, knowledge, and self-reliance
We - started talkin bout Martin and Malcolm
Had these ghetto kids goin, ""Huh, what about him?""
1989, Professor Griff speaks his mind
But his freedom of speech is declined
1990 came with the West coast
East coast, West coast, who is the best coast?
Lookin back now, of COURSE it was bogus
The whole argument was where we lost focus
We got hopeless; not with the lyrics and music
But with hip-hop, and how we used it
Or abused it, you know how the crew get
""You like it cause you choose it""
1991, we opened our eyes
With Human Education Against Lies, we tried
To talk about the state of humanity
But all these others rappers got mad at me
They called me 
""Captain Human""
, another message was sent
""Self Destruction don't pay the {fuckin} rent""
Remember that? 
Nobody wanted conscious rap
It was like - where these ballers at?
Where can they call us at? All was wack
Hip-Hop culture was fallin flat and that was that
So in 1992, I found my crew
They said, ""Yo Kris, what you wanna do?""
I said, ""Damn - why they wanna get with me?
If I bust they {shit} I'm contradictory
If I play the bitch role, they take my shoe
Tell me what the {fuck} am I supposed to do?""
So I did it, don't stop get it get it get it
All of a sudden these critics they wanna spit it
""Kay Are Ess One is con-tra-dic-to-ry""
Just cause I wouldn't let these rappers get with me
{Fuck} that, {fuck} you and {fuck} your pen
If a rapper wanna diss, yo I'd do it again
But I'm makin these ends, and I got my friends
And I really don't wanna have to sit in the pen
So I go back to the philosopher
1993 hip-hop is uhh.. wack
Go back, check the facts
1994, ""Return of the Boom Bap""
It wasn't all about the loot
It was all about Harry Allen Rhythm Cultural Institute
Blowin up, 1995
Conscious rap is still alive
But nobody wanna play it, nobody wanna say it
Nobody okayed it, they'd all rather hate it
1996 it really don't stop
We put together somethin called the Temple of Hip-Hop
Not just DJin, breakin, graf and lyrics
But how hip-hop affects the spirit
""Step Into a World,"" that's what I did
'97 I was raisin my kid
Or kids, but I, had to go
Cause New York DJ's changed the flows
To clothes and hoes, but that wasn't me
I'll be damned if I dance for the MTV
So in 1998 I began to debate
Should I go now, or should I really wait?
'99, I moved to L.A. you see
And took a gig with the WB
Started studyin philosophy full-time
To have a full heart, full body, full mind
But you know what the problem is or was?
DJ's don't raise our kids, cuz
They so caught up in the cash and jewels
How they gonna really see a hip-hop school?
How they gonna really see a hip-hop temple?
They don't even wanna play my instrumentals
, 
but
Big up Dr. Dre, Snoop, Xzibit
Especially Xzibit, he was there in a minute
Mic Conception, all of them, said
""Yo you need help? I should call them""
When I was in L.A., I held the crown
Bloods, Crips, they held me down
I could never forget 
Mad Lion
, killer pride
With the gat in the lap in the low-ride
Oh I can't forget, Icy Ice, Lucky Lou
Julio G
, that was the crew
Davey D
, Ingrid, David Connor
The list goes on and on, let me tell ya
FredWreck, and my man Protest
Much respect, no less
To my spiritual and mental defenders
Big up to L.A., temple members
But in 2000, I seen how I wanted to live
I wasn't no executive
So I picked up the mic and I quit my job
Said to Simone I gotta get with God
She said, ""Don't worry bout these dollars and quarters
Record companies ain't got nuttin for ya.""
Damn, she took me back to Bam!
Took me back to who I am!
Brought me back to the New York land!
Now I overstand!..
{interviewer}
Now KRS-One, now you've been quoted as saying that
Rap is something we do, hip-hop is something you live
{KRS} Yes!
{interviewer}
Explain that to us please
{KRS-One}
Well, well, today hip-hop, we are advocating that hip-hop is not
Just a music, it is an attitude, it is an awareness, it is a way
To view the world. So rap music, is something we do, but HIP-HOP
Is something we live.
 And we look at hip-hop, in its 9 elements;
Which is breaking, emceeing, graffiti art, deejaying, beatboxing
Street fashion, street language, street knowledge, and street
Entrepenurialism - trade and business. And uhh, that's where y'know
That's the hip-hop that that that we're about. We come from the uhh
The root of, of Kool DJ Herc, who originated hip-hop in the early 70's
And then Afrika Bambaata and Zulu Nation (mmhmm)
Who instigated something called The Infinity Lessons
And added conciousness to hip-hop, 
and then Grandmaster Flash
With the invention of the mixer
, 
on to Run-D.M.C. and then myself
And uhh, we created the ""Stop the Violence"" movement, you may recall
A song, ""Self Destruction"" and and and so on. 
All of this, goes to
Uhh uhh, the idea of LIVING this culture out and taking responsibility
For how it looks and and acts in society",https://genius.com/Krs-one-hip-hop-knowledge-lyrics

We stick 'em and jig 'em, we pick 'em and kick 'em
Flippin' them whip and
I'm wing clippin' them lip cause I'm cold sick of them
Much quicker than them lyrically trickin and
My tribe be on a quest like Tip and them
On every avenue puttin the full clip in 'em
Splittin' and strippin' 'em down while spittin' a round
Into them soundclash see winnin' them, just begginin' them
Get rid of every bit of them with them negative idioms
I don't even consider them in the new millenium we killin them
Breeze Deep, Kenny and Will and them, KRS-One we thrillin' 'em
Many battles we been in them now we rebuildin them
We blaze, fulfillin them, Keith the Clink, Jesse, Jamil and them
We originate styles, others be stealin'them

You got a good rise in your rolodex, who flow is next?
Comin out to fuck with the best, put it in your chest
Inhale it and hold that, blow it out when I say let go
Let's see if you can hold your breath by the time I flip to the next flow
This show is real, this is the deal, guns I'm running
Gotta make it out of town to flip my shit and keep it coming
Then bring it back with another stack of raps
To blow your back out
How many of y'all wanna go for yours?
I keep my dogs in the crackhouse

Let's take a walk through Crown Heights
Steppin through the city at night with a bunch of niggas and two mics
Form a little lynch mob, and stomp through the five boroughs
Head back to Brooklyn in the Expo
Back on the block, I see the cops everybody clockin
Buckshot, when you see the rocks, me I got you shocked
Why not? You see the recipe
Buckshot, I represent Brooklyn and my nigga Biggie

I'm from C-I, L-I, F-L-Y
Where the niggas and the bitches stay paid, fly and high
Where a slut'll get mad if you call her a bitch
And a rat'll get mad if you call her a snitch
Where the rich emerge, with the niggas from the ditch
And it's a myth, they get niggas from the suburbs, that's herbs
Yo, this is for my niggas on the block all day
Who don't give a fuck waiting for crime to pay
Put your money on it, yo, we never fronted
Long Island got some of the best niggas that ever done it
From Riverhead to C.I. to Brentwood to Wyndanch
Niggas coming through will not stand a chance
From Roosevelt to Freeport to Hempstead to Uniondale
Coming deep from the depths of hell
I'm dead serious, even though you see me smilin'
Rough enough to break New York from Long Island

We destroy niggas, need advice cause I heard 'em sayin Jesus Christ
You should see the sight, cookin ox-tail, peas and rice
Making about a G a night, they can't read or write
But I got every creed and type
You need a dyke, baby girl, I see the light
But sometimes y'all get crimey crimey, grimy grimy
But those with a tiny hiney they get whiny whiny
So guard your girl, Harlem World, cock the gun, pop it son
Fila fam, illa players, Killa Cam is still the man


Yo, hit you with the force of an iron horse
Tear your face off the planet, leaving one-third damaged
With your back cracked the Earth canvas, leavin mountains slanted
Rock the Earth off the axle, crabs who
Polar bears beneath the sea gravel
Thoughts be runnin wild like the Lil' Rascals
Puttin' dinosaurs inside of figure fours, rip you with nine inch claws
Chasing motherfuckers through malls and clash in halls
Beating motherfuckers through walls, stompin through floors
And jumpin' down elevator shafts
Searchin' for they ass, stayin' low in the grass
Wearing a gas mask, wrapping their hands up in plastic bags
On stage like a savage goin' mad
What? Yeah yeah, suuuuu!

Yeah, by all means you know you gotta put Queens on it
Put cream on it, Q.B. we rep often
Take over your party, slam dance with your hood
Took your ladies back to the projects with us
Then sent her ass back on the Q-train home
Satisfied, she learned the words to my thug song
See we one big borough of Dons with firearms
And we never use those, til the man act
Other than he's 'sposed to, nigga what I'm 'sposed to do?
Shots whistle, damn near missed that, stash the pistols

From the, tip of my Timbs, to my eyebrows
The hostile, eEnglish, Olde E widemouth
Get PCP fiends, jumpin off cliffs
And if you had the balls, you'd be walkin off stiff
My paragraph alone is worth five mics (uh-huh)
A twelve song LP, that's thirty-six mics (uh-huh)
And while you win Un Hype (uh-huh) I spit on your snipe
And tell you fuck you and that bitch on your bike
Brick City

Ayo, now bust it, never try me crimey, I'm grimy, so don't deny me
I be little like your Rascals and stymie to fly that hiney
Buy me keys, to my Benz and my Coupe
Like Jay and Run and D.M.C.'s, that's the name of my group
(Now speed it up) Beat to the rhythm of the rhyme
I'm givin up a dime, there go another line you figured
Never drivin by nine, never givin up a dime if you was
Never been that nigga
If you really wanna test me, brother don't stress me
Or you just be bowlin
It's Reverand like a Jesse, brother that's just me
And that's just my colon

The five boroughs of death, we rep to death
Step aside little niggas, show time, yep
It's goin down the moment we inside the spot
Let's rock'n'roll, you know the M.O., it gets real
When the five boroughs of death, we rep to death

If you want the hip hop to build
Say blowe
I'll be rocking all year round
You better cool the F out before we go up in your mouth

It's just beguuuun, to bubble
KRS-Onnnne spells trouble
On the mic soooon there is no double
I emerge from under the rumble
Count the truth poetic construction, audio abduction
Showbiz production for wack lyric reduction
And fly rhyme instruction keep the party hoppin'
Keep the DJs buggin' for the orthodox
Non Xerox hip hop chatter box
It was dope first crack out the box with Scott LaRock
How MC's are washed up like sweat socks
KRS-1 makes the heads nod

KRS-One
Yes, my son?
Tweet tweet
(x2)
You know they can't compete, ain't that right
No doubt. You better cool the F out before we go up in your mouth

When it's my turn kid, look at what you done did
Like my head is dreadable you edible
I kick incredible shit, for my poeple
I'm jackin' these like me so sue and Stretch like Bobbito overloops
While you sittin' on stoops I'm rockin' mics for U.S. troops in group
You screwed up, oops, I can read a true crook
Like I can read a good book
I'm hooked on hip hop culture
Look at the tip top lyrical structure
Floatin' like a soap bubble that you don't wann puncture
Or rupture, I write what I udder, 
mother mother mother
There's too many of us dying
 still trying and not doin'
Not suceeding still pursueing what you doing?
What you doing? What you doing?
The session is started departed on schedule
I beg you please lookover my lyrical menu
What other can't do I can do
Enhancing 7 levels of your mental
I dismantel stress, you're listening to the advanced lyrical best
Worldwide qualified to administer any MC test
Stop guessin' class is in full session
Now Showbiz show 'em how",https://genius.com/Krs-one-blowe-lyrics
Rappaz R. N. Dainja,KRS-One,1995.0,"""Rappers are in danger""

Blast-Master Kris I don't talk ish
Expand your consciousness and dismiss foolishness
No one is new to this or new to Kris
In hip-hop's atomic structure, I am the nucleus
That is the center of the group we/us
They/them/you, every squad, every massive, every crew
Dental floss is lost when a true rapper jumps off
The cash is incidental but not meant to distract you, of course
The style that I am kicking is like chicken
It will be bitten, rewritten, then performed for a $25 admission
Reviewed in The Source
You will listen then find something missing of course... it's skills
That's what you're fishing for, it's lost
I'm getting too explicit, the track jingles
I won't do a wack album then remix it for my single
Kicking rhymes 'til I wrinkle, and my brown eyes twinkle
God-core hip-hop for the nine-cinco

""Rappers are in danger""

Tasty like a souflee french croissant on Tuesday
Rappers be boo-tay
Goo-fy that's how they crew stay
Bitin' whatever you say to boost they ego
We know the steelo, your whole character is foul
Makes me want to shoot a free throw, BLAOWW!
From the git go, no, get go, my flow hits low
Wherever all the dope shit go, there's where my shit go
Bee-dee-bee-bo, skank, I think
Self with ya groups everyone else and the bank
Others like to bring the shottie to the party
I bring knowledge of self, you cure the mind, you cure the body
Some rappers like to come to the party, hopin' to leave with somebody
Check, I come with skills and I leave with your motherfuckin' respect
Ahh yeah... so check, UH!

""Rappers are in danger""

New types of verbal hip-hop I bring
When you know you can sing, BOY, you know you can sing
I do not clutter up the airwaves, with stacks of useless facts
MC's trying to be macks, but acts like ignorant blacks
Freak that, I'll snap your back as it cracks
You will experience, loss or lack of balance
Stop the violence, fry from week to week like an allowance
All of you are cowards hiding behind the mask of MC
I remember, thinkin back to '83
No video, no, you had to be a real live MC
Now you younguns grow up buggin, any new jock you're huggin
Weak production, let me tell you somethin
Any MC can battle for glory
But to kick a dope rhyme to wake up your people's another story
Act like you never saw me
'Cause when it comes to lyrics, I'm in a different category

Comin to you live and direct from the 1986 version
Comin up to 1993
Of course, Premier on the beat
Now check it out

The girlies is FREEE-EEE
'Cause the crack cost money, oh yeah!
I said the girlies is FREEE-EEE
'Cause the crack cost money, oh yeah!

Ridin one day in a '92 Beamer
After seven years I seen Denise she still a skeezer
But look what she did, she went and had a kid -- no dad
And just released her ass out the rehab
You think she'd act like she don't know
She's still a ho, but umm check my man for the show
""Hiiiii, DJ K-R-S""
She tried to shake her butt, I rolled my window up!
She got pissed and said, ""You ain't all that!""
And went and got some other girl schemin for crack
In my car, I couldn't hear what they spoke about
I hit the ac-celerator and I was out!
I never check my man but I knew the plan
Come to the jam MC's in there be thinkin they Superman
Sure enough, the place is packed with no breeze
Crazy girls -- and wall to wall MC's
I'm like a cat these MC's are Fancy Feast
I'm thinkin of rhymes but I'm interrupted by Denise
She said, ""Kris I really need a favor honey
My girlfriend here really needs some quick money!""
I looked at her girlfriend and her girlfriend was fly
But I ain't stupid, she had that LOOK in her eye
I touched her back, she said, ""Denise has he got the crack?
Is he the one? I gotta run back and feed my son""
I said, ""How old is your son?"" She said, ""Three months""
I walked away but my man cold bust her fronts
So she pulled out a gun and shot him in the party
Except for the MC's, I knew EVERYBODY
She tried to let off a shot, one more time
But got stomped so bad, she turned to wine
No one could find Denise for several weeks
You know the time, on this '93 beat

The girlies is FREEE-EEE
'Cause the crack cost money, oh yeah!
I said the girlies is FREEE-EEE
'Cause the crack cost money, oh yeah!

I knew a group that had a dope lead singer
Swinger, single guy, that knew his style was fly
After the show he was tired sweaty and kinda sloppy
But of course, a million girls are in the lobby!
He saw a group of girls hangin out and lookin good
So he took one to his room because he knew he could
Inside the room he said, ""Make love to me and never stop""
She said, ""Sure, but how's about a crack rock?""
I knew my man down the hall had it all
So he called, down the hall, but homeboy wasn't there at all
He turned to the girl and said, ""My man ain't there""
So she let down her hair, unzipped his pants down right there
Oral sex in effect, or rather deep throat
But just before he came she bit his dick and slit his throat
As he fell back dizzy, he began to choke
She took his wallet and said, ""You ain't broke!""

The girlies is FREEE-EEE
'Cause the crack cost money, oh yeah!

Ova Here,The Mix Tape,2002.0,"First of all...
I don't know WHO y'all saw on this stage before me, alright
I don't know WHO y'all are gonna see on this stage after me, true
But this is real... hip... hop!
Word up
I'm gonna find out tonight
Where the real Hip Hop

The real hip hop is (Ova here)
The real hip hop is (Ova here)
The real hip hop is (Ova here)
The real hip hop is (Ova here)

Blaow-blaow, blaow-blaow
Clear em out; clear 'em out
Word

Yo, Nelly—you ain't for real and you ain't universal
Your whole style sounds like an N'Sync commercial
Ignoramus, I'm the baddest with the mic apparatus
Challenging the God of rap is madness
I'll snatch your status with this ugly looking billboard, you could stop them
But I got enough albums to make my own top 10
You limited, like the speed of traffic
You bite my style off the radio, so when you speak it back, I hear the static
You better Chillout like Chuck, I kick like 3 Norrises
One of my 16 bar rhymes is 8 of your choruses
Of course it is ridiculous
Watch out, I be in the club inconspicuous
Gotcha on your hands and knees
Ain't it about time for some real emcees?

The real hip hop is (Ova here)
The real hip hop is (Ova here)
The real hip hop is (Ova here)
The real hip hop is (Ova here)

We on the hunt tonight
When you see me coming, I don't front I fight
People say I'm contradictory
Cause I'm all about peace to say the least with a violent history
It ain't no mystery, these rappers wanna get with me
My people don't see that all they hear is: ""Stop hittin' me!
Stop beatin' me Kris!""
You want to help my career Nelly? Well, you can help if you don't exist!
I think it's 'bout time we stop these pop rappers
Fuck these pop rappers, hip hop does matter
To me; does it matter to you, my crew?
If it does, you know what the hell to do
Throw your guns in the air, pump it like, ""Yeah""
Let these bitch ass rappers know we in here
Go to the shows huh, boo 'em off stage
Tell 'em KRS told you they're at the end of they days!
Let me tell you, let's give hip hop a lift
And don't buy Nelly's album on June 25th
That'll send a message back to all them sellouts
House nigga rapper, your bottom done fell out
You don't even know how
I told you I wasn't talking about you then, but I'm talking about you now

Build ya Skillz,KRS-One,1995.0,"Check, I control your mind with one rhyme I speak
And get you open like a prostitute's butt cheeks (yeah)
Rappers get kicked in they mouth with cleats
Cause they're speech refuses to reach beyond the beach
Have a seat quick (uh) I speak or spit flicks on your cheap hits
Time to complete shit, no weak shit, I mean freak shit properly
I can feel myself becoming a lyric monopoly
Others will copy me but repeat my shit sloppily
Shocking me with inclinations of rocking me
Insanity it got to be
My true identity is never meant to see
I simply use the gifts sent to me mentally

Yo! Word up! Get from out my face, before you get bust quickly!

That's the hip hop, the hibby
I rip it in a minute cause I'm gifted like December 25th
Now let me flip I'm all knowing, lyrically syllable growing
Even when it's snowing, I'm party going
Free flowing and stomping! Never tip-toeing
Overthrowing the comp Big up Bronx!
I got more styles than the planet got women
I got as many rhymes as is many styles of women (tell 'em)
Don't make me come out on that ass start flippin'
Your mental I'm afflictin', actin' ill and sickin'
Pickin' the victim at random, slammin' 'em
Draggin' them to the stage and dismantlin' them
As my Hydrogen turns to Helium, I shine
None of your lyrics I'm feelin' 'em, 
you rhyme
Like you should be wearin' an apron scrapin' a pot with a name like Mariam

But rappers talk too much shit
And can't back it up with lyrics
Build ya skillz

It's time for the raw shit, not that on tour shit
That outlaw shit, that real hardcore shit
KRS runs shit like diarrhea
Bitin' motherfuckers hear my name and get up outta here
I don't care this year, a lot of albums is whack this year
""Will KRS bring it?"" Ahh yeah!
Thanks for the invite, it's just about to get hype
That straight up raw street type shit is what it feels like
I will be displayin' lyrical styles I'm saying
Lyrical styles from the miracle child
Want a pile of ill styles wildin' on your stereo dial?
Smile, I been here for a while
Peep my style while I go on with the song
I rock the microphone then take it to the streets with the Krylon
Clicka clacka! clicka clacka
Take a spray can and slap a wack rapper!
Stacks of money for videos I don't have it
You're lookin' at the last MC with true talent
Get your tape recorder fast kid
Boombastic another classic
Turn up the cassette
!
All my styles are lyrically fantastic and movin'
While soothin' any urges for booing
Ungluing your mouth from my private
The more the merrier syllable superior
East coast- West Coast battles are inferior
Cause I by myself will take out the whole North America
We need to expand rap beyond this land
Set up competitions with England and Japan
World cups for rappers that really fuck shit up for fun
Yeah I know I'll get one",https://genius.com/Krs-one-build-ya-skillz-lyrics

Turn it up, stop frontin', c'mon, turn it up
Alright, check it out ninety-three lyrics, here we go

I never want a jheri curl up under my hat
The woman in my bed has got to be strictly black
I never want money if my lyrics are wack
So I must-, rock-, the mic
I play only the reggae and I play only rap
I rock the African, the European, and Jap-
Panese, I got to show you that I am all that
So I must, rock, the mic

Are you tired of lyrical liars, passing fliers
Wannabe emcees, but really good triers
Tripping over mic cords, getting you bored
A total fraud, this kind of thing I can't afford, so I
Pick up the mic and kill it ill it top bill it
The club is a skillet, where MC's get fried in it
You got beef chill it, blood I spill it
After seven long years of ripping the party and I'm still widdit
You call my name I don't think about suing ya
I come to the club with that Booyaka
Laughin' while I'm doin ya the crowd is booin' ya
Gimme one month, record for record on tape I'll ruin ya
Some likkle awl pon sound bwoy wan fi rule de city

Here comes the rootical ratical teacha
I'll eat ya defeat ya beat ya till ya stagger and ya teeth chatter
You'll be goin through convulsions as I flash data

Panese, I got to show you that I am all that
So I must, rock, the mic

Of course yeah I'm the most brilliant recording artist in your life
Never have to repeat a rhyme style twice, precise
In a lyrical drought like water to your lips oh yes my lyrics will suffice
I'm nice, like beans and rice, I am delicious
Who's the freshest lyricist on the mic, you don't want to fuck with; KRS is
Lyric for lyric, rhyme for rhyme, style for style I break you like dishes
Either you come fully correct or the lyrics you simply makin' wishes
We got no time for fake black leaders and dreamers blowin' wishes
Youse a fraud, I mean a fraud like in fraudulation
I know what it is, the crown of rhyme supremacy you're tastin'
And yes, before the flavor hits your greedy tongue
You get ripped up by KRS-One
Now, lyrics, somebody want lyrics, from the lyrical terrorist
Here's a little somethin for you all to remember KRS, and remember this
I am no pessimist, more of an optimist
Activist revolutionist, yes the hardest artist
And the smartest, Premier spark this

2nd Quarter - Free Throws,I Got Next,1997.0,"Anybody in here right now with tape decks turn em on
And put em on record, I'll give you a second
I want to add authenticity to your tape
So when it's sold out in the street
You all can know this was a real party
These are poems circulating throughout the nation
Everybody's bad and everybody's tough
But how many people are intelligent enough
To open up their eyes and see through the lies
Discipline themselves, yourself to stay alive
Not many
That's why the universe sent me today on this stage
With this to to say
The rich will get richer and the poor will get poorer
And in the final hour many heads will lose power
What does the rich versus the poor really mean?
Psychologically it means you got to pick your team
When someone says the rich gets richer
Visualize wealth and put yourselves in the picture
The rich get richer, cause they work towards rich
The poor get poorer, cause their minds can't switch from the ghetto
Let go, it's not a novelty
You could love your neighborhood without loving poverty
Follow me, every mother, father, son, daughter
There's no reason to fear the New World Order
We must order the whole new world to pay us
The New World Order and the old state chaos
The Big Brother watching over you, is a lie you see
Hip-Hop could build it's own secret society
But first you and I got to unify
Stop the negativity and control our creativity
The rich is getting richer, so why we ain't richer?
Could it be we still thinking like niggas?
Educate yourselves, make your world view bigger
Visualize wealth and put yourselves in the picture!",https://genius.com/Krs-one-2nd-quarter-free-throws-lyrics

Writing on the walls, mixing characters with letters

Today we do the same thing, with how we rap and draw
We call it hardcore, they call it breakin the law
There used to be a time when rap music was illegal
The cops would come and break up every party when they see you

Rhymes Equal Actual Life, In The Youth
""These are the streets!
Shit is real out here!
This ain't no fuckin joke!""
I lived in a spot called Millbrooke Projects
The original Criminal Minded rap topic
With twenty cents in my pocket I saw the light
If you're young, gifted, and black, you got no rights
Your only true right, is a right to a fight
And not a fair fight, I wake up wonderin who died last night
Everyone and everything is at war
Makin my poetic expression hardcore
I ain't afraid to say it, and many can't get with it
At times in my life, I was a welfare recipient
I ate the free cheese, while the church said believe
And went to school everyday, like a god damn fool
Well anyway, here I am, chillin at the party
Brothers lookin at me like they wanna kill somebody
A cypher manifested in the center of the jam
I got to show these wack rappers really who I am
It's me against them, so I clear the phlegm
And wage the war, hardcore to the end
For someone lookin inside, yeah from the out
It seems like disrespect is what rap is all about
But hip-hop as a culture, is really what we give it
But sometimes the culture contradicts how we live it
Cause every black kid lives two and three lives
The city's a jungle, only the strong will survive
Reality, ain't always the truth
Rhymes Equal Actual Life, In The Youth
Reality, ain't always the truth
Rhymes Equal Actual Life, In The Youth
Every single day I hear lie after lie
Like ""Black people don't die, we multiply""
So when I kick a rhyme I represent how I feel
The sacred street art of keepin it real
Why I gotta listen, to somebody else?
How they got wealth, let me talk about myself
But all I really got is hip-hop and a Glock
The results are obvious, if I'm confined to my block
Occasionally, in the city I'm released
To meet other beasts, lookin for the feast
We grunt and growl, on the prowl, as the air gets thinner
""Yo yo there he go, him,"" there's the dinner
White meat, carryin a bag of some sort
Life is short, white meat is quickly caught
A scuffle a muffle yet none of us hesitated
Like Mother Africa, white meat is violated
We quickly disappear, like Santa's little elves
And go into a area to fight amongst ourselves
We say, ""peace/piece"" cause that's what we really want
A piece of the pie that America flaunts
Reality, ain't always the truth
Rhymes Equal Actual Life, In The Youth
Reality, ain't always the truth
Rhymes Equal Actual Life, In The Youth
""Oh shit!""
The truth is that police must serve and protect
REALITY is black youth is shown no respect
The truth is government has a war against drugs
REALITY is government is ruled by thugs
With all this technology, above and under
Humanity still hunts down one another
Rappers display artistic cannibalism
Through lyricism, we fight each other over rhythm
Through basic animal instincts, we think
So the battle for mental territory is glory, end of story
Reality, ain't always the truth

The System Gotcha,Never Forget,2013," x2
So if you think you're too old
Your thinking that you're too cold
You gave up on your true goals
The system gotcha
I'm giving you a new soul
You're never ever too old
To manifest your true goals
Or the system gotcha

You're never too old to sell a key
So how could you be too old to emcee?
I'm from where it originated so get me
Why would I stop what I created, even at sixty?
Shout out to Herc and Cindy
Hip hop lifts me and never left me
You know where KRS be
Right there where the best be
When I spit a free I can't help it if that's how God blessed me
So I'm never empty, writer's block never tempts me
With twenty albums I mastered this evidently
So I ask you gently
You don't see how to spot me on the block with my classic medley?
I can't stop, people won't let me
I don't talk sexy, but I do come correctly and you can check me
But just don't compare me to the next G
KRS-ONE: when you get older you'll respect me


I keep it moving all over the country
Doing underground spots with the ceiling above me
I keep it dark and ugly, microphone crusty
We will be here forever; trust me
I rock the spots that be dusty and banged out
I do house parties, raves and gang hangouts
Others took the same route, we didn't take the main route
You know who they are, I ain't gotta call they name out
They superstars, but in 1986 you ain't know who we are
And notice when I said ""who we are"", as opposed to ""who we were""
Cause the past and future already occurred, but it was blurred
Time reversal symmetry just occurred
My being is timeless if the future remembers me
And there's no end to me, word!
Past and future happen at the same time, especially in the memory
We share the same mind. Images of my future telling me the same sign
In 1983 who I'd be in '09, but it's past 2011 and I flow fine
Rapping at 70? Believe that it's no crime
These youngins rent they style, I own mine
As you can see, I don't be relying on my old rhymes
I'm spitting raw rhymes, right here, right now
25 years, I never put the mic down",https://genius.com/Krs-one-the-system-gotcha-lyrics
Know Thy Self,Spiritual Minded,UnKnown,"You ready to go? I'm ready to go
What about y'all, y'all ready to go? (yeah aight yeah) I'm ready to go
Look

Know thy self, and thou shalt know
The universe and God (whoa-ohh-ohh)
God is the mother, the father, the friend
Know ye not that ye must be born again?
What does it mean to be in the world but not of it
It means you want the cars the cash the jewels the house but you don't love it
It means to taxes regulation state law you live above it
It means you a FREE hip-hopper, you ain't nobody's puppet
You don't see no money on me, you see it up in the cupboard
You see me up in Toys'R'Us, with my seeds cause they love it
You see insurance flash out, if my kids pass out
You see seven acres of land where we can all spaz out
To all my fathers that fathered, hold your head up for starters
Teach your toddlers, not to be thieves and robbers
This that other kind of rap, that leads to true hip-hop
There's other kinds of raps, but they lead you to get shot
The choice is yours, you gettin older now
You got a kid comin, how you gonna hold it down?
It's one thing to be iced out and rocked up
What's the point if you're gettin locked up?

Know thy self, and thou shalt know
The universe and God (whoa-ohh-ohh)
God is the mother, the father, the friend
Know ye not that ye must be born again?
It's really time we seperate the young men from the big men
The young girls from the women, whatever the title that fit them
My style designed to open a child's mind when I spit them
I only got a little bit of time to really rhyme and uplift them
You see them brothers talkin about that crime? Forgive them
It won't be long before they words manifest and they live them
Sometimes you gotta go back to the beginnin to learn
After fifteen years I'm just BEGINNIN to burn
To all my true hip-hoppers, that pay bills and live proper
Never allow a negative thought to stop ya
Correct ya posture, stand upright not uptight
Don't be scared of the light, just prepare for the fight
We say ""Criminal Minded"", cause our thoughts are illegal
We represent the very thinkin of, inner-city people
Real people, people that take care of theyself
They need health, love, awareness and wealth
Not to mention, knowledge of God
Not college, the job then dead - if you agree nod your head
It's one thing to be iced out and rocked up
But what's the point if you're gettin locked up?

Know thy self, and thou shalt know
The universe and God (whoa-ohh-ohh)
God is the mother, the father, the friend
Know ye not that ye must be born again?
C'mon c'mon yo, tonight is it
We gonna steal away together, through these rhymes I spit
When the student is ready, the teacher, shall appear
So I'm here, but are you really ready to face your fears?
Mo' money, mo' money, is that your credo?
You've been livin in a dream world Neo
, power to the people!
Nobody's equal, everybody's diversed and different
My lyric'll never cheat you, my verse is gifted
So manifest what you believe is God almighty
It could be Allah Jesus Krishna Buddha Aphrodite
It could be Nefretire come hear me and never fear me
It's like at some point in your life you gonna have to hear me
I represent them teachers preachers comin through your speaker
Manifestin another lesson to them true believers
Instead of pickin up our women ready to mistreat 'em
You better get yourself a wife and kid and never leave 'em
You better teach 'em you better read 'em you better feed 'em
The system will defeat 'em if you don't teach 'em the cops'll beat 'em
The style that I be kickin quick is ""Edutainment""
Hip-Hop culture needed a teacher quick so I became it
Instead of rhymin about my history and what I been through
I'd rather rhyme about awakening the God within you
Yo, it's one thing to be iced out and rocked up
But what's the point if you're gettin locked up?

Know thy self, and thou shalt know
The universe and God (whoa-ohh-ohh)
God is the mother, the father, the friend
Know ye not that ye must be born again?

Fourth Quarter - Free Throws,I Got Next,1997.0,"Yeah, listen to the lyric. Here we go!

We are the ones prophesized to return
My main concern is for all of you to learn
How to live, yes through the lyrics I give and send my friend
This age is coming to an end -
Not the world - but the age is ending. (ending)
Listen to the astrological message I'm sending (I'm sending) (Tell 'em.)
Truth is truth, whether or not you like me:
We are living now in the age of Pisces
When Pisces is over, at the year two thousand
When the Sun of God changes his house and
Enters the Age of Aquarius
The Sun of God as man is hilarious (okay)
When you think of Jesus, think of the Sun
The flaming Sun, that's where they stole this concept from
Stop believing and read your bible logically;
The New Testament is really old astrology
Jesus is the son of God - no lie -
But they might be talking about the Sun up in the sky
The Sun that hangs on the cross of the Zodiac
The Zodiac with twelve signs to be exact
Each sign is a house, and you should keep in mind
Each house equals, a period of time
The time: two thousand years and that's a fact -
It's called an age or a house in the Zodiac
The twelve disciples are twelve months of reason
The four gospels signify the four seasons
When Jesus fed the multitude with two fishes
It signified the Age of Pisces, not fish on dishes
If you read the bible astrologically it's clearer, (no doubt)
The next age will be the age of the water-bearer
It's called the Age of Aquarius, (word)
When logic and truth will take care of us
So in this age of spiritual dignity
You'll see a rise in femininity
And creativity, meshed with masculinity
You got to get with me, this is your true her-story (rrryyy!)
Do you wanna go higher...",https://genius.com/Krs-one-fourth-quarter-free-throws-lyrics

You Don’t Really Want It,Prophets vs. Profits,2002.0,"My rhymes still be ill
You don't really want it
I suggest you chill
You don't really want it
#1 I'm still
You don't really want it
The prophecy is fulfilled
You don't really want it
KRS in the streets
You don't really want it
I drop the rawest beats
You don't really want it
No ice just heat
You don't really want it
Playa face defeat

That was a nice try Nelly, I don't mean to be bold
But put that ""Hot in herre"" bullshit on hold
And let's get down to the facts of the matter
In the dictionary, under whack rap: you the rapper
It's simply cuz you're lacking the spectacular vernacular
And hip hop's character seems to be in back of ya
Either that or you're truly amateur, I'm asking ya:
How does it feel to have the whole world laughin at ya?
You just too stupid to see
I was made on the streets, you was made on MTV
How you gonna talk about my nose to attack me?
When you steady guzzling them pills for your acne?
My nose comes from a line of kings
Your acne comes from you eatin the wrong things
Your words don't make me hurt, they make you work
You'll hurt when you find it's you getting jerked
I tell ya, it don't take me to say
Don't buy your album, street cats ain't buying it anyway
You telling me make up my mind
Yet on your album, you don't know if you wanna sing, or rhyme


You trying to diss me? How?
If it wasn't for the true-school your bitch-ass wouldn't be here now
Blau blau, show me respect from the gate
Or I'mma have to drown you kids like Andrea Yates
You can't handle the break, I'm a flamethrower, you a bic lighter
You think I'm cocky cuz you a dick rider
I spit tighter, I'm not like all the rest
I'm not a playa, but I did stay at a Holiday Inn Express
So nevertheless I'mma teach ya, teach ya
But when them slugs hit you, you'll be screaming, ""Momma, EI! EI!""
You never seen me sing? You don't know what I bring?
You'll be singing the blues like B.B. King
I'm all about the unity of Miss and Mistas
You all about grabbing money and dissing our sistas
Take your ass back to TV land
And let this be a lesson, you can't see me, man!


Just when I thought I could do my gospel
And become an apostle I got a whole to get hostile
I don't mean to knock ya Nelly
But ain't you that MTV house nigga with a spine like jelly?
I'mma do this by the book, for the art
I heard what you said on BET's 106 and Park
But what you don't know, is right around the corner on 3rd
I hold a Desert Eagle, and no, it's not a bird
You sound absurd, you're gonna bring me back?
I taught all year round the spot ??? had
You copycat, with sloppy raps
You chill with N'Sync, I chill where hip-hop be at",https://genius.com/Krs-one-you-dont-really-want-it-lyrics

Its time to kick ass
Yeah
Same shit
Yeah
Same shit
Wake up

Listen
Terrorists and governments play the same game
Banks and big business take the same blame
Open your brain
The Klan and the cops are the same
Slave quarters, blocks, and prison blocks are the same
They only separated by name
Overrated by fame
What's in a name?
Our colonists is the same
People can't really see it
Because they're blocked by the name
But really Nazi Germany and your black is the same
Look
Wall Street and Main Street
Really that's the same street
Drug talk, corporate talk
Really that's the same speak
Boom bap, boom bip
Really that's the same beat
A throne or a chair in your home
Really that's the same seat
I wrote and recorded this album in the same week
California and Barcelona
Its got the same heat
I walk the same street
Put no trust in the game
Good cop, bad cop
They one and the same
Same shit

You know
Listen

Rapper and politicians they want the same thing
To kneel before their master and kiss the same ring
But Solomon and Selassi them are the same king
So from (?) I spit the same swing
Ding ding ding, there goes the bell
I'm the same as heaven, these dudes the same as hell
I'm the same as the plane at liftoff, fly
They the same as a rip-off, a lie
I remind you
Don't let the criminal mind blind you
Instead let the spiritual mind find you
See I'm you
Just twenty years ahead
Its to your advantage to hear KRS-ONE and rewind what he said
Its the same shit

Its the same shit
Look

Drug cartels is what sells the medical
Drug spots and drug stores are identical
Y'all need to wake up and join with the woke folk
Ignorance is only gonna keep you with them broke folk
KRS is on some cool shit
I ain't nothing to fool with
I teach more kids than the school gets
Game over, stupid
Its like we at the eight ball corner pocket
And I got the pool stick
You can say whatever, me I'm living better and better
Getting cheddar, out in Greece getting the feta
Up in Catalonia only eating paella
Up in Italy getting bread, call it bruscetta
I spit
They cruise cars, I cruise ships
Democrat and Republican, that's the same shit
Its the same shit",https://genius.com/Krs-one-same-shit-lyrics

I'ma grow dem and show dem what a leader is
I'ma teach dem the laws of receive and give
Knowledge Reigns Supreme, believe and live
You done heard the hype, COME to where the talent is
""I'm Still #1,"" yup you heard right
People say, ""KRS-One you shine bright!""
Others say, ""Yo - you rhyme tight""
When you find me, you find light, and that's alright
I don't know about pimpin, sellin women like retail
Or turning coke into crack for resale
But I do know if we fail
In 2020 our children by the million gonna be jailed
We got the victory over the streets
God willin we chillin, we know we gon' eat
I'm a whole different kind of MC, hoes don't like
Not tempt me but the ladies treat me oh so gently
Universities sendin me stretch Bentleys
My seminars and lectures, are rarely never empty
We teach students plenty, honorary degrees
Gold and platinum plaques I got many, ask Kenny
People get shocked when I walk into Denny's
Or the corner Kwik-Stop, they say, ""That's Hip-Hop
Right there,"" and yeah it's really quite clear
2004 might be the right year
For mental and spiritual repair
The solution is in the resolution you just declared


When I speak like this
Knowledge Reigns Supreme, hip-hop philosopher
All in the street well I'm very popular
All through the hood I make all the stops and I
Avoid the cops and them random shots well I
Love hip-hop and I, live hip-hop so I
Spit that shit to get you off your block cause I
Can't understand and I, wish I could see dem
Cats that talk bout they love the hood and they
Never bring the hood anything that's good, and they
Rap for the money tree, chasin a company
But I think you can now see, rap is fun to me
I got a ministry, a class, a staff that's under me
KRS in pop rap?  Nah, it ain't ought to be
It'll never happen like, you eatin pork with me
Amateurs hawkin me, DON'T EVEN talk to me
My house is in Atlanta but I still got New York in me
Walk with me, most rappers are short to me
I'm like Chamberlain, dominatin the sport you see
I toss MC's off of me

Uh-huh, whatchu thought?! Yeah, yeah
Yeah, whatchu thought? Uhh, uhh, uhh
Yo, yo, back again! What's that? Back again!
What's that? Word! C'mon

A North Face and skully hat don't make you a thug
A army suit, a pair of Timbs don't make you a thug
An ill mug and a gat don't make you a thug
A real thug is a thug that's Hush!

Let us begin, KRS, winnin again, KRS-One did it again
KRS bigger than them, look at them they bit it again
I think my gun just gonna start clickin again
Click-clack, I always spit back
Anybody call my name I go get that
In fact we draggin 'em out, to a deserted route
The teacher returns, you must learn, the word is out
No doubt highly respected, Front Page Records
Off the hook, yet still connected
Are you teachin yourself, teachin yourself?
I'm like history repeatin itself
""Criminal Minded"", you've been blinded again
Lookin for my style you can't find it again
You can find these others that may sound like Kris
But when it comes to the hands they don't get down like Kris!
They never ran up in the clubs with a hundred thugs
Never had the respect of Crips and Bloods
Never knew B.O., they never knew Big Pun
They never battled MC's, they never bust they gun
They don't know that, all they know is that show DAT
That's Digital Audio Tape if you don't know that
Now go back and get my name correct
'fore I snatch that platinum from 'round your neck

A doo rag a platinum chain don't make you a thug
A fat ride with chrome don't make you a thug
That tough guy talk don't make you a thug
A real thug is a thug that's Hush!

What mean the world to me? H-I-P, H-O-P
And S-I-M, O-N-E, and G-O-D, I stay low key
I go down to hell, and slap up Satan
Then return to heaven, where Scott LaRock is waitin
Resurrection, just like my brown complexion
When I speak, I don't need protection from the heat
I walk these streets and I'm quick to hit first
Throw on any beat I'll be quick to spit first
And rip town, I take one look around
And all you hear is, ""Get down, get down, get down!""
Knowledge Reigns Supreme
, I stay on blast
That's why these rappers want me to go on last
That's the truth, that's the fact, that's the deal
Forget sex appeal, my tech is real
And my rep is real, K-R-S
Woo-woop-woop! That's the sound of E-M-S
The rag on your head, it best stay white
Cause I can turn that red in a mintue a-ight?
Now go back and get my name correct
'fore I snatch them diamonds from 'round your neck
Once again, get my name correct
'fore I snatch that platinum from 'round your neck

A North Face and skully hat don't make you a thug
A army suit, a pair of Timbs don't make you a thug
An ill mug and a gat don't make you a thug
A real thug is a thug that's Hush!
A doo rag a platinum chain don't make you a thug
A fat ride with chrome don't make you a thug
That tough guy talk don't make you a thug
A real thug is a thug that's Hush!

To all my heads who wanna see an improvement
In hip-hop culture, join this movement
We need more Glocks than my man Freddie Foxxx
The knowledge I spit to the click it don't stop
That hardcore God-core, ready to start war
Rock more shock more top your pop tour
I'm sure I'll drop the grade to zero
When the teacher return, I don't chase DeNiro

"Health, Wealth, Self",KRS-One,1995.0,"Yeah.. yeah.. yup!
You know I was just downstairs
And I was on my way up here to the studio and
A guy bumped into me and
And he said.. he said, ""Yo Kris!
How is it that you stay in this music?
You know, this rap music especially for so long, so long""
I said, ""Well you know years ago I made a deal with the Goddess""
He said, ""The Goddess?""
I said, ""Well yeah, you might know her as God
But I know her as the Goddess""
The universal mother
The mother of everything you see in existance
I asked her for assistance
In lyrical persistance
And she gave it to me, under one condition
She said, ""I'll give you the gift
But use the gift to uplift""
I said, ""Okay mom!""

So I tell you the truth, really
Me nah gon' need nuttin else
But health, wealth, and knowledge of myself
Me nah gon' need nuttin else
But health, wealth, and knowledge of myself

In the beginning was the word, the word was made flesh
Knowledge K. Reigns R. Supreme S
Some of us guess while others of us are blessed
Take heed to the word, that I manifest
I manifest the future, the present, followed by the past
Everything in nature, rules by kickin ass
What they tellin me, but yo, you a friend to me
So I'mma tell you the secrets of MC longevity
Secret one: if it ain't fun, you're done
And about your career, huh, well choose another one
If you don't like what you do, you're through
Lesson two: make sure you got a dope crew
Not some crew, that's like an anchor on a shoe
A MAD CREW, that's of some benefit to you
Lesson three, might be contradictory or funny
But MC's should have OTHER WAYS of gettin money
That's to say learn other things beside music
Make money elsewhere, Hip-Hop you won't abuse it
Too many MC's, just emcee
So their longevity, is based on an Uncle Tom at the record company
Lesson four: sell your image, never sell a record, image is respected
Records come and go and get collected
Even the records of platinum artists, that used to rip shop
Can be bought, for a quarter at the thrift shop
Which brings me to lesson number five, the illusion
Has me thinkin, the minute they drop a record
They'll be cruisin, in the Acura
Slow down!  You're still a amateur
What seperates the pro from the amateur is stamina
Not how long you can rhyme, but how long you've been rhymin
Changin with the times, and findin yourself
Still climbin for wealth
Blow for blow, you're still growin, still showin
(all knowin) now that's a pro at it

Thank you Mother, I'm out",https://genius.com/Krs-one-health-wealth-self-lyrics
Wannabemceez,KRS-One,1995.0,"""One two, testing one two
Alright party people in the place to be
The party has already started
An-an-an-and it's about to il-il-il-ill *echoes*""

Let me introduce you to another type of rapper MC
Where glamour and glitter don't matter gently
I'm tired of the Chattanooga empty
Classical like a German luger
Deep like a tune for scuba diving who am I the hyper
Like I said before my radar's going BIBBIT BIBBIT
The microphone I grip-it grip-it, lyric lyric I live it
Hear it my spirit is where it should be
Don't push me if you pussy, HUH
I spot em, it seems you want to ride the dillz
I got em, KRS got skills in the place
I waste megahertz of bass bottom,
 chill
As I rock em and get ill, I build the perfect spot to kill
Verbal excitement will lead to your indictment
Whether or not you like it, 
still, number one
 I hype it
Your album, rewrite it

How many MCs, wannabemceez
Never be MCs, cause they can't MC
How many MCs, wannabemceez
Never be MCs, cause they can't MC

Triplet syllables for minimal criminals
Lyrical riddles that got hard flavors in the middle
Sit back and chittle as I stand and still rebuild on skills
The admission of serial lyrics, calculated to weaken the spirit
Will be diverted by this lyric when you hear it
Ricochet any style any day
Any which way and you'll Cherish the Day like Sade
The advanced oratorical techniques I speak
Keep the heat at full peak! My grammar
With stamina, grabs a rapper like the fresh catch of the day
And crack the back of that DJ
I'm strappin and attackin a pack
And whatever happens after that just happens, FACT
Flamboyant and flashy is one point in time when you're not ashy
Focus on the syllable formats and the cash G
G for guard your grill, I'm hard to kill
Odd but ill, a job to fill is to refill on skills
We built and killed style and skill
While poetically recriminate you like a child I will
Get ill, and switch to earn
Cause I prefer to slur but not blur
Blurring you're stirring up trouble surely you don't need it
Be seated I'm undefeated dem not see it
Observe me then beat it


Let's get back to the point quickly, get with me
The voice from New York City is too witty
I come from a era of ?OJ cars?, 
Latin Quarter
Fake Gucci and fake Fendi, you can't send me
Nowhere, that I ain't been to
You can't tell me nuttin that I ain't been through
Disrespect the teacher I gots to get you
*cause they can't MC*
But what you really sayin
You sound like a bitch-ass rapper when he's saying
""Yo Kris you hit too hard"" stop playing!
Switching and swaying
Day in and day out, your styles are played out, see you way out
Before you're laid out, your bright lights start to fade out
The last thing you heard is ""Who let the K out?""
No grey area
Everything is black and white we took the gray out its scarier
Either you're winnin or losin, spinnin the rules of conscience
But lyrically there ain't no stoppin
I'm droppin a lot in your noggin
Cause I know that you're lyrically starvin
Carbon, your name, battle battle
Everybody wants to battle but you BAB-BLE
Who knows ya, battlin me, is the only way that you can gain exposure
I feel for ya soldier
I hate to say it but I told ya so
You know that I know the ancient flow KRS-One
Is the holder of a boulder yo
, money folder yo
You want a fresh style let me show you slow
Your blow, I'm not your foe
Battling me? No no no no no no NO!


If a DJ think he man den he better prepare for war!!
BDP crew get up in that ass like a piece of toilet tissue
General Lion I chase them all and I am on fiyah
Represent the hardest crew, you know how we do

Hold,KRS-One,1995.0,"I'm thinkin' real hard about some money I can hold
But everybody I know is deep in the hole
A steady payin' job is too hard for me to hold
I call around for work but they puttin' me on hold
But in my hand a shiny .45 is what I hold
I make a mayonnaise sandwich out of some whole-
Wheat, I'm feelin' weak, I can't hold
I gotta rob somebody tonight and take the whole
Bank roll, some cash I gotta hold
At the bottom of my shoe is a little bitty hole
That's it, my mental sanity I can't hold
I'm walkin' to the store with this pistol that I hold...

Half of me is sayin' maintain and uphold
Suddenly I bump into some asshole
He's cursin' me out, but this pistol that I hold
Took control, and in his head I put a hole
Ahhh man, now I'm lookin' around the whole
Area, the gun is still hot that I hold
I'm buggin' out, and I don't know how much longer I can hold
I feel myself sinkin' deeper in the hole
So in my victim's pants I rip a little hole
And felt for the wallet, and took the whole
Bill-fold, forty bucks is what I hold
Suddenly I hear, ""Freeze! Police! Hold!""

In the penitentiary I see a whole
Bunch of blacks and Hispanics that they hold
In my cell I cry like hell, my head I hold
One day somebody ax if my shoes they could hold
I told this guy, ""Listen! My shoe's got a hole
But what's up with that shiny sharp knife that you hold?""
He lunged forth, the first thing that I thought of was to hold
The arm with the knife so that he couldn't put a hole
In me, but then I put him in a chokehold
Took the knife and in his neck I put a hole
Suddenly all the C.O's come to me and it's me they hold
Beat my ass and I spend two weeks in the hole
I'm ready to bug out, my sanity I can't hold
My needs and wants messed up my life on a whole
(Damn, just wasn't satisfied with life)

The moral to the story is...
Your addiction to your needs and your wants
Is what causes problems in your life
Make sure you got what you need
Put at a safe distance all the things that you want
It's wants that get you into trouble
This is the balance of life
The balance to life on a whole",https://genius.com/Krs-one-hold-lyrics

It means you gotta be free to be underground
Yo, you got your own key when you're underground
If you're listening to me yo you underground

It's time that I open with a thunder sound
Now look around your own town for the underground
Yo, you rhymin for the TV, or a million CD's?
You ain't a MC, you ain't underground
You could be platinum or gold, hot or cold
But it's the respect you hold that's underground
When the critics don't get, that for the streets you spit it
When your lyric they fear, that's underground


Yo, white kids, black kids, skinny kids, fat kids
Them Asian cats be underground
Chicanos, Palestinians, Milanos, fuck the Lone Ranger
Where's Tonto? That's underground
Freddie Foxxx, Blackalicious, Kweli
M.O.P., GangStarr that's underground
Mad Lion, Smif-N-Wessun, Buckshot
Armageddeon T.S. that's underground, UHH!


Yo, the t'cha returns, I told y'all I went to Cali to learn
And that shit was underground
If the cops be eyein you, cause survive is what you try to do
Yo I'm wit you, you underground
If it's justice you want, and you protest the ice they flaunt
You want skills that's UNDERGROUND
Yo it's not about a rugged rapper, or an actor
It's about your subject matter, that's underground
LOOK!


Chevonne Dean from Ruff Ryders, all the Outsidaz
Young Zee, that's underground
When all your money's spent, and you're still hangin on
To 50 Cent (get it) you underground
When you rep the collective consciousness of hip-hop
Not hip-pop
, you underground
Yo it ain't about jewels, bitches and cars
It's about Nas, that's underground, yo!


To be underground simply means that you're down
For the struggle, get 'em up, that's underground
You could be a classy lady or a whore
But if you protest the war, for sure, you UNDERGROUND
If the government can't see you, or deceive you
You love your people, believe you underground
If you refuse to play the game, you go against the grain
You ridin the train, you underground - get it!


Yo, yo, that blast from the past, like Grandmaster Caz
Bam and Flash, that's underground
Doug E. Fresh, Lord Finesse, KRS
If you listenin to this you underground
Turn it up now KRS about to show you how
They go wow, BLAOW for the underground
Mr. Walt, Evil Dee, KRS, BDP

Disaster Kit,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Whatever might go down, we gon' survive that
Food, clothes and shelter, we gon' find that
When you hear this sound, you know that I’m back
Hey, it’s where I put your mind at

When that disaster hit, don’t you get trapped in it
You must always stay prepared with your disaster kit
In the club you might be drunk and you may laugh a bit
But when you sober up you know it hits what you have to get
Stay prepared, never be fear for no evil scared
These natural disaster, cannot be compared
So rise and realize you will survive
In the mean time prepare yourself with these supplies
Get coils of rope and coils of wire, in a water proof container
Put all your fire, like matches and candles, and don’t wear sandals
Get some hard boots and work gloves to handle
The situation, cause when disaster hits the nation
You and your family gonn need your medication
Antibiotics, aspirins, don chronic
Even health foods like vitamins and garlic
Pain relievers, inhalers and breathes
And make sure you got something that can take down a fever
A spray bottle of water, with 10% bleach
So you can disinfect the objects you reach
And speaking of bleach, here’s what I teach
Don’t think that you can drink the water from the beach
You gonn have to drink that water from your hood
And purify the water to make sure it’s all good
Put things in order
Put 8 drops of pure unscented liquid bleach
Into the water, use only 8 drops for every 1 gallon you working
You’ll need about 5 gallons a person
With no water, things could get lethal
It’s dehydration, not starvation that kills people
So look for the water first, don’t be robbing and looting and stealing and killing
That will only make things worse
Be smart, plan ahead, save some cash, a radio, some gas
And some blow up beds
Keep your disaster kits high on the shelf
With your weapons, you might have to defend yourself
Get a flash light, chemical light sticks and whole that
A compass, some dry food, maybe a road map
Don’t forget things like peroxide, listerine, bandages and antihistamines like Bendadryl
So when things get ill, you will survive
Cause you really got skill
You opened your eyes
After you got through your list of supplies
Check your attitude, know that you gonna survive",https://genius.com/Krs-one-disaster-kit-lyrics

Give me relief! Squash all beef!
Don't let these arguments destroy us! I sing!
Give me relief! Squash all beef!
Don't let these arguments destroy us!
Check it
All beef can be squashed if you want it
But instead of forgiveness, ego you flaunt it
Everybody gets into two or three quarrels
Leadin to a squabble, someone will die tomorrow
Life is not a thing you can borrow
All beefs don't have to lead to sorrow
Will ya, go out tomorrow
I think, you should think about the beef you got
And confront your enemy before it gets too hot
Never feel ashamed, to say, ""Yo G I'm sorry
I apologize,"" the object is to stay alive
I never ran from the Klu Klux Klan
And I shouldn't have to run from a black man

He said she said, but she said she didn't
Face gets hit, and then, bullets start spittin
No one's admittin to their wrong doing, unfittin
Revenge we're pursuin, look at what you're doin, LISTEN
Release the karma that you're carryin'
Be a mental vegetarian indulge in no beefs, like the
Fish in the aquarium
, you'll enjoy it while you're tryin it
There is no seperation between the mind and the environment
Like a bolt of lightning
I'm givin 5000 volts of the occult while I'm writin and recitin
I've come to enlighten black and white to the meaningless fightin
Clash of the titans ain't right
And it's wrong so the song reflects
For too long we've been vexed at each other
Every sister, every brother..
You've gots ta LOVE one another
I never ran from the Klu Klux Klan
And I shouldn't have to run from a black man

I never ran from the Klu Klux Klan
And I shouldn't have to run from a black man

Don't let these arguments destroy us! Ha hah
Give me relief! (That's right)
Squash all beef!
If I ruled the schools, from pole to pole
The entire judicial system would fold
I would get rid of the books cause they bogus
And in school, Knowledge of Self would be the focus
Kids would flock to the schools like locusts
Cause school now relates to them, and you would notice
Violence in society would be a minimal
Cause the education yeah, would now be metaphysical
Not livin by laws, but livin by principal
If you disobey, the UNIVERSE gets with you
We would study giving so no one would steal
And we would read each other's magnetic fields
Petty crimes times petty crimes
Equals prison for lifetimes
The universe divided by two
Equals me and you
Me and you, go into the universe once
Or as one united front
But listen up, when I was growin up in hip-hoppin
We had a thing called Jailhouse Boxin
That's why I'm STILL here rockin
Cause my competition never pulled a Glock in, yeah
Give me relief! Squash all beef!
Don't let these arguments destroy us! I sing!
Give me relief! Squash all beef!
Don't let these arguments destroy us! Yeah!
Give me relief! Squash all beef!
Don't let these arguments destroy us! I sing!

Ill Will, slap dem up

MC's get ate, get broken like a pretzel
And get dissed if they ever try to step to
They can't take a MC with loose lips
Talk a lotta shit but sink no motherfuckin' ships
Lyrics make bigger holes than hollow tips
Watch another rapper body get stiff
Just like in church, we pass the basket
As I preach over his casket
Fuck it, kick the body right over
And say ""See ya, hmm...nice to know ya""
Got another rapper to see
Yo Kris, bust that ass 

Either shit or get off the pot
Let the original rapper rock the spot
You stand there and jock, goin' 
This is absolutely ludicrous, what can you do to KRS
Chattin' foolishness, step along quick with that stupidness
It's me reppin' this for self, where else ya lookin'?
I got more rhymes than all the Jamaicans in Brooklyn
So beat it or be seated, gee, I'm mad undefeated
Young boy, you can't see me, run along and make pee-pee
I was rockin' rhymes when ""La-Di-Da-Di"" was a demo
Admit you been on my tip for years and just can't seem to let go
Go, go call your mother, tell her you wanna battle KRS quick
I bet the minute you get home you'll get your ass whipped
Crazy ill mad styles is what I give'em
Not a run-of-the-mill'em, I drill'em, I got ridiculous rhythm
None of my styles you can get with'em
Still um, will um, your crew come get some so I can kill'em

Well I roll by myself but don't let it fool ya
If I got beef my crew'll damn step to ya
We don't play no games, I'll come straight to your rest
Lift up your shirt and blast you in your chest

A fad doesn't fill the bill, but mad skills will
Don't let me have to kill you kid, god forbid still
Greed will lead your need to succeed
But your speed, your speech
Your outreach is a breach of what I teach
For lyrical styles you're a leech
If I was Spanish I'd say, 
Wow-wow-wow-wow, wow-wow-wow, wow-wow-wow...
Wow, for a amateur you really looked hard
But you're really a bitch, when you get it together
Call me, here's my card
Check the list: you lack breath control, mental behaviour
Lyrical talent, imagination and flavour
I got no time for amateur rhyme, you could be hurt
Thinkin' you're hard because you wear a gangsta T-Shirt
I'll smash your wanna-be ass in the deep dirt
Black, you'll come up dizzy sayin' ""How da fuck he do dat?""
Cause you're yappin' like you can't be reached
If your name ain't Arrested Development, well save your speech
Time to ill, I got mad skills to fill
Not a fake, I got more styles than Drake's got tasty cakes
Gotta be the best, gee. Don't try to test me
You'll get jacked son, even if your name is not Jesse
Let's be up front when I meet ya
Peace, uh, I'm the motherfuckin' teacher

Well, now there is, word, 'cause he's up there to see
Moving around, he's chilling with Prince and James Brown
If our people are up in Heaven, their loving is raining down
The only force to save us from city was hip-hop
The only force that made us grimy and gritty was hip-hop
We all respect the world's religions and the laws they laid
But I know Scott La Rock's gonna come to my aid
See, these saints are great, but they're not where my heart be
When I call on the angels, I'm calling on Marcus Garvey
I'd rather call on Bob Marley, oh yes, sir
Kwame Ture, that's my real ancestor
Why call upon the spirits of oppressors
When you can call your own angels when you under pressure
See, when it comes to hip-hop, here's the lesson
Start praising your own people, hip-hop speaks from Heaven

Hip-hop speaks from Heaven
Tell me who you repping, yo, this another lesson, yo
Hip-hop speaks from Heaven
Tell me who you repping, yo, this another lesson, yo
Go, hip-hop speaks from Heaven

When I think of Brooklyn, New York, I'm seeing B.I.G

It's forever 2Pac, it's forever Heavy D
It's forever Big Pun, it's forever O.D.B
They was live, now deceased, from the West to the East
It's forever Phife Dawg, Big L rest in peace
What happens next, we shouting out Professor X
Shout out to Freaky Tah, shout out to Proof, big respect
We can't forget, so we bubble with joy
When we reminisce over you, Trouble T-Roy
Shout out to Keith Cowboy, Ms. Melodie all day
Shout out to J Dilla and Jam Master Jay
It's love I'm sending to you
Shout out to Guru, and Mr. Magic from the Juice Crew

Hey, hip-hop speaks from Heaven
Tell me who you repping, yo, this another lesson, yo

Forget who's the best guy
This that time to think about Pimp C, Buffy, and Lisa Left Eye
Frosty Freeze breaking in the breeze
Big Bank Hank still inspiring MC's
We'll never be free until we free up our mind
We praising our enemy's God's fallen behind
Yo, it's all in the rhyme, the past is gone
But I can still feel the spirit of Master Don
Yo, many have been lied to, so here's what the wise do
Praise your own people, the force is inside you
Like a late fog in the mist
I see MCA
 and rest in peace Nate Dogg
They names and they natures will last
Like Chris Lighty and my man Bill Blass
When it comes to hip hop, here's the lesson
Start praising your own people, hip hop speaks from Heaven

Ah hah hah, heh heh heh, EHHH

Some fear de 'matic, yes de automatic
Disrespect, from MC's, me nah go have it
De automatic, get de automatic
Tonight a rapper gwan die

Crazy MCs waste they time chasin millions
While KRS-One, holds the minds of the children
I'm buildin a followin of a hundred and forty-four thousand
Chosen few heads up in project housin
A true rapper, street rapper, rappin to the center
I enter any cipher, with tales of adventure
If rappers are ridin beats like cars, I'm bendin mad fenders
Put down your mic and surrender
You's a pretender, Blastmaster KRS rules the pavement
Kickin 
Edutainment
 while you wait for your arraignment
Save it friend before your chest I cave it in
I got my way again, 
I'm classical like a fuckin Harley Davidson
How do you think I kick a lyrical style no end, you figure?
It's simple, I'm a rap God, and youse a nigga
Don't mean I'm bigger, it simply means I'm smarter
For starters, I come at you poetically harder


Ha hah, fake ass rapper, how you think you got juice?
When you rock a pair of panties underneath your bubblegoose
(Word) KRS-One will fuck up parties dramatically
My reflex'll slap a wack rapper automatically
When you was home witcha mother, afraid of the dark
I was sleepin out in Prospect Park
Eatin one meal every 48 hours
Writin dope rhyme styles that you now devour
Don't you realize, that I'm all about survival
I got only friends cause I KILLED all my rivals
Show up at the rhyme recitals, took they titles
From 
'86 to '96 completes my first cycle


I spent 40 days, and 40 nights in the wilderness
I'm hard, from head to toe yo there ain't no killin this
I wrote over 100 rap hooks
And sociological books, while you worried about your looks
Now you wanna enter the dragon in sound
But I've got the live club show locked down
Platinum and gold don't hold in my arena
You gots to keep it real on the mic, when they see ya
I manifest, in the West, the East and overseas
Division in rap is wack, and I don't know of these
I represent New York to be specific
The South Bronx, but in Japan I'm still gifted
I grab a jet and land on your set, what the fuck?
Twenty bucks for a rap show is still, twenty bucks
I start from '86, and bring you into '96
No gimmicks, tricks or lip-sync lyrics


Yeah yeah it's the God Fat Joe
Representin the motherfuckin South Bronx
With my nigga Kris, knockin off frauds
Motherfuckers wanna do what?
Big shout out to my nigga Kenny Parker
Ill Will, BDP crew for life nigga
Naughty Gotto, the Big French productions
Of course the TAT crew, my nigga Brim

Uh Oh,Return of the Boom Bap,1993.0,"You ain't that tough ya
Choose the right friends
You ain't that tough now
Don't make your life end

You walk around the town like you a big man
But you never know now that there's always a bigger man
You sling the M-16 and flash the M-1
But you don't know what you're doing never learned to handle one
But true! All you friend thinking you a gangster
While your mother tried to warn you from certain danger
So when you in your room you playing with your Mac-10
Fully loaded automatic, just you and a friend
You posing aw dey mirror like you a gangster clown
But the Mac-10 go off and you friend go down

Uh oh! What you gonna do now?
Uh oh! They gonna blame you somehow
Uh oh! Tell me what you gonna say
Uh oh! Look, they cutting you away

Your father telling you ""Now son just go to school
Don't go acting like a fool and don't go acting too cool""
You get to the school and meet up with the right bunch
Just a group of kids with no names taking people lunch
You join the clique because you wanna meet some girls
And you want a little prestige in you little school world
One day you're walking with your crew along the road
And a member of your crew pull out a gun and unload
He shoot a parked car and all you run far
You and your friends laughing like you a superstar
And you get home and you thinking it was fresh
And a cop meet you there with a warrant for your arrest
Them ask, ""Who shot the gun? why you walking down the street?
Didn't you see the little boy there in the back seat sleep?
Now the boy dead we want to know from you
Who shot the car up, are we gonna take you?""

Uh oh! Now what you gonna do now?
Uh oh! Boy, them gonna blame you
Uh oh! Now tell me what you gonna say
Uh oh! Look, they cutting you away

You ain't that rough ya
Choose the right friends
You ain't that tough ya
Don't make your life end

White kids! You living in the whitest part of town
You are a white kid but you know you hang around
So you and your friends thinking that you are all of that
When you see a youth walk by and yes the youth is black
One kid say ""Hey, what you doing on the block
We don't want no niggers here unless he is a cop""
So the kid pull out a big baseball bat
And them him slap with the bat because the kid is black
Now then the kid fell down but still alive
So he reach in his pants and pull out a four-five
Pop! One friend drop and everyone run
Out of all the white kids now you the only one
You start cry, cause now you gonna die
And it's all because what your friends did to this guy

Uh oh! What you gonna do now?
Uh oh! He gonna blame you somehow
Uh oh! What you think you gonna say?
Uh oh! Now them cutting you away, check!

You ain't that rough ya

How then, can they talk of some border
When they are the invaders?
How then, can they reform immigration
When they invaded their neighbor?

America existed before Columbus
Thirty thousand years ago we were here in Mexico
Where's all my Motiacans at? Cock your rifle let it blow
Blow, blow, blow, blow, blow all invaders gotta go
This one for my people, my Mexicano people
The whole earth is yours and no human is illegal
Come across the border every woman and man
The US is the alien, Mexico this is your land


We see the same men living out like cavemen
Coming out the cave and them trying to enslave men
How can we obey them? It's better we betray them
Rise up like the reverend Nat Turner and slay them
Mexican people get your education
Tell your little children that this their nation
You own California, You own Arizona
You own San Diego, and Texas the Lone Star


Take a look at Mexico, then look at New Mexico
What is a New Mexico if there is a Mexico?
All of America They used to call Amexem
Immigration laws are a fraud and we reject them
We are the Olmec, Toltec, pyramid builder
Astronomer, philosopher, and healer
Mexican people rise up right now
And realize that this is your land now

Flashlights, canine dogs and crooked copper's
Automatics, tear gas, rams and helicopters
Off of marijuana, on the East Coast every year
While California selling that high grade everywhere
It's crazy how the East Coast considers herb the enemy
While every corner in LA is a dispensary
The country been split on this issue now for a century
Why would a natural harmless herb lead to a felony?
New York need to catch up
The pace need to pick it up

Into the plantation prisons they wanna dump us

Stop Frontin’,Return of the Boom Bap,1993.0,"Bo! Boom bye bye, hip-hop will never die
Despite the fact that I'm fly I'm never dry
You could beat me, cheat me, when you meet me try to defeat me
But nevertheless you'll have stress, cause I don't rest
You wanna know what my problem is, if you're curious??
I take this hip-hop shit too serious!!
I forget that other rappers ain't true to this
So when they grab the mic I get hyped like LET'S DO THIS!!
All my rhymes are fat, while rappers are skimpy, wimpy
So I simply chew they crew like a Blimpie
Skip me when you dissin, skip me when you on a ego mission..
I blow up, like nitroglycerin!
You better tune in to Teddy Ted
""
Yo stop frontin', and use your head
""

Well if you ain't called it hip-hop, there's a door, I ain't stoppin
I got more flavors than Baskin Robbins!
I flash the funky fresh flavors force-fully
Freak the phonies and flip philosophy constantly (true!)
That reminds me, rappers rock drip-drop
Not hip-hop, they wanna SING and all dem ting
Thank God KRS is still rappin; all that ""ooh I love you baby""
And ""blink blink blink"" - this ain't happenin

Yo this is curtains for these rappers that be frontin on the next man
Lookin down at brothers just because they gettin checks and
Haven't got a skill but they're LARGE on the hum-bum
You wanna step to Kid Capri, COME COME COME!!
I break em up, just for actin like a superstar
Around the way, we got a neighborhood trooper car
We ride by, and spray your crew, and your honies too
And rip you open and drink your blood like a Mountain Dew

I descend I lend a friend a helping hand
To stop a trend, again and again and again, I just can't say when
I beg to confess my sins to other men
Reverands guard lips, within there I'll begin
I'll always win, over-sakin
The party is ripped, without a hit or with a hit I'm rippin shit
You must admit, I'll never quit the lyrics I flip

New, York, City, get it right, get it tight, get it hype
New York City's in the house tonight
All day, off and on, Broadway
The world's Big Apple is what they all say
Wait, way back in the day
Dudes from the South migrated this way North
Lookin for the higher pay of course
Led by the forces they became big bosses
Like Rick Ross is, the city that never sleeps
Yup, New York is

It put the strength inside of my life
But New York City got its challenges also
Racism, sexism, crime, you all know!
Them guns that keep goin off bustin
And another one bites the dust when
Conflicts arise and dudes start bustin
And cussin, I gotta speak to this
New York is not unique in this
But if we keep sewing this we gonna keep reapin this
I'm teachin this, we gotta overcome our weaknesses
Remember man!


Big up to the firefighters, rest in peace

When I rock so eloquently
Put the beat on and let me
Kill another wack emcee
Can't trust them, never test me
I practice and study
But I'm not in it for the money
But to me they look so funny
You can't test the teacher
The teacher won't reach intact
Through the speaker you're weaker, now sit your ass in the back
My lyrical you hear it, you fear it, you can't get near it
Cause the spirit eat Eric
And Eric your rhymes is wack
Like that, that, right back
Check it out!
Check it like this

Spanish*
You know you gots to build just skills, uh come on get down
Just skills  You know we got to build just skills, come on get down
Yeah, uh come on
I got that rip track, flip that, underground rap
When I kick back
Most of what I'm hearin be weak
So I speak through beats and the streets as I teach
I impeach, through speech, each lyric leech I reach
Have a seat in the lecture
Nothin can protect you
Hard is the texture
Of the mic wreckin rock in your sector
Better than ever remember I am no beginner
I'd like to shout out Eric Skinner
Just skills, you know we gots to build just skills, come on a get down
Just skills, you know we gots to build just skills, come on a get down
Yo, we livin in a world of private jets and limousine
The fruit we eatin as we prepare tangerine to nectarine
See everybody livin in the same routine
We need the telephone, and yes, we need the fax machine
You listen to the sound, well I think you know it's me
Now, let me educate you with my concious poetry
Me want, me want, me want, me want, me want no wack rap
Me want, me want, me want, me want, me want no wack rap
Me love, me love, me love, me love, me love it when it's bad
See if you wack rap you ought be steppin out the back
See emcees on the microphone forgettin that they black
See hear them kick the lyrics that are holdin people back
But when you hear the teacher, KRS will find the track
You bound to see the light, and you don't want return back
So listen very closely to the secret scientist
I'm sending this one out to all my inner city kids
Now you supposed to be apostle what you have inside your head
Can make you more reliable, it can make you feel dead
Now listen very closely to the way I say this rhyme
It's the thing called the brain, and the thing called the mind
But I'm outta time
Chorus (scratching on the word ""can""):
Can I tell them that I really never had a gun?
No, you can't cause now you bouts to get done!
Can I tell them that I really never had a gun
Never had a gun, never had a gun?
Can I tell them that I really never had a gun?
No, you can't cause now you bouts to get done!
Can I tell them that I really never had a gun
Never had a gun, never had a gun?
On the block you just yap a whole lot
About the clothes that you got
Yo, or the gold that you got
Everybody sees all the friends in your Benz, yo, it's fat
But they ain't gettin money like that
Word to my brother Kenny, jealous one envy
The rich are few, while the poor, many
But you got gold cuffs and cars and stuff
You eatin well, but still in the ghetto you dwell
You know it's hot, so you make it known about your Glock
To any perpetrator tryin to blow up your spot
You grab the microphone and talk a good ramble
You the hardcore outlaw, criminal, vandal
Burnin emcees like a candle, but you frontin
You ain't got nothin, with your life you gamble
One day you gamble up snake eyes
Talkin all that junk about you don't take dives, you take lives
Nobody on the block tries, cause you claim you got powerful ties
So at the red light you arrive
And to your surprise you get heffed up with just two steak knives
You're terrified, they take your Benz, and what makes things worse
You ain't got guns to burst

Cercle Rouge, KRS-One
Droppin on em like this
Pick it up, pick it up
You know what time it is when KRS-One comes through
Representing all true hip hop culture
You know how we do

How can they throw you in prison now for long years
If in reality the black man doesn't belong here
Have you forgotten how we got to this place
Why then are all the jails predominantly the black race
If you dont teach me my culture I dont know who I am
I dont know the difference between my enemy and my friend
So I'm robbin and killin I got nothing to live for
You turn my father into a boy my mother into a whore
Now I'm hardcore on the Ave
Watching while people that got me to walk fast
After beatin us, rapin us and robbin us
400 years of that's what's inside of us
Take a look at me now I'm really your creation
A technological anti-human mutation
A mutation of a better way of life
You first pulled the knife but to heal it will take my whole life
I fought no force on this level
I listen to bass and treble
Thinking that the white man is the devil
Cause who could be so cruel like this
So heartless, so senseless
But I'm taught by the devil
To grow up and be a Devil
To do the same devilish things on another level
However when I act out the mission
You turn around and throw me in prison
You a sucker

If you come from France
And you like the breakdance say OHOH (OHOH)
And If you come from New York
And you like the way I talk say Yeah (Yeah)

You can kill a man by taking him out of his land
And putting him in a land he really doesnt understand
Then teach him to respect Greek mythology like
Pythagorus, Ptolomies, Socrates
These people are thieves
They stole us astronomy, mathematics, all tactics of biology
Even the concept of democracy stolen from the king Akhanoton
Put down the book, use your brain
If you dont know who you are you are clinically insane
The board of education can't see that
Well it deserves to get beaten and robbed by black
Give me my frame of mind back
Give me my culture
But you dont understand that cause you a sucker


I see Beauval in the house, Collinet in the house
Sarcelles in the house, Cercle Rouge in the house
KRS-One rocks the mike without a doubt
Turning parties out
You know what I am about
Cause we will be here forever I told you
Soldier floods your mind like Noah
As you get older you've got to pay attention
At how you livin hardcore
You ain't a kid anymore grow up, to blow up the spot you're at
Learn the skill and go to the top of that
Cercle Rouge definitely rockin in rap
KRS-One I got your back


KRS-One with the freestyle rhyme
Representing Cercle Rouge in France

Verse One:
I rock slow and easy like soul
The New York flow, is strictly for the pro
Hip-hop! Ladies and gents
So you can know, every word yo, of the sentence
Hey la, like De La
, I got 
Common Sense
Save the compliments for after I commence
To evidence of MC's, rockin under false pretense
Yes they get burned like incense
Myrrh and frankencense, you know the consequence
When you rock with KRS and don't make sense
Kris represents all MC's, that rock with ease
I'm not conceited, I got confidence in my abilities
Agility's my credibility
Oratorical artillery in all facilities
It Takes a Village like Hillary
When killin me, KRS has wide range capabilities
On the microphone, in the combat zone
MC's get eaten like the ozone layer
Hey ya, I'm not a playa I'm a teacher
But if I wanted your girl
You'd be Living Single like Latifah
Action Uptown like Monifah
I hit like a beeper, and hot like the bunny on Easter
Lyrically let me freak ya
With moves like Scoob and Scrap
Rock Stready, Stretch, Al and Kiko
I warm up any room like a heater
Bringin a New Balance to the speaker like a sneaker
Still a teacher, prove it, 
like medicine squared
This Garden of Eden, keeps the party movin

Verse Two:
I'm interested in skill and how we build as a culture
I don't eat off old material like a vulture
Repeatin myself for wealth is bad for my health
Everyday I express myself with a dope lyric
From my inner spirit, then I share it with others
As they hear me, enhancin
East and West, overseas, brothers and sisters
Sons and daughters transcended all borders
I deal with mind expansion
Anytime you aimlessly dancin, and romancin
It's your life that you be chancin
Not that I wanna sound gloomy
But I don't rhyme about Judy Judy, cutie and shake your booty
When you gonna grow up and be GOD?
Instead of making a rap a full time job
Yeah, it's a job and not an art
They only rhyme to get money;
Cause true self-expression takes heart, and guts
Rhymes, and cuts
Tight minds and not tight butts
Reach your goal, like a puck
I wish you good skill and not good luck
Cause only skills put you up out the gutter so I utter
(""Bring it back, that old New York rap
Bring it bring it back, that old New York rap"") - repeat 2X
Verse Three:
That old New York flow means wrote for fun
And if the money come, THEN THE MONEY COME
But today and everyday, KRS speaks the truth
We dealing with unemployment in the city black youth
Usin rap, to put clothes on they back
No culture, or disciplined, way to act
But soon yo, we'll take care of alla that
We're huntin fi de power help supress people tracks
That keep the culture intact, and soon you will see
In the black community, black unity
Not black nudity, after black puberty
For every crew to see, to breakin down the black community
The only one to blame is you and me
For not takin responsiblity for our artillery
Verbally, you heard of me, 
Knowledge Reigns Supreme
Over Nubians Everywhere, I kick it cause I care
The end isn't near, it's way over there
BLAOW! The only reality is now
But when I say bring back the old flava
That means bring back the ORIGINAL MC behavior

Body body rock body body rock
I'm the king of rock'n'roll, ahh yeah
Throw your guns in the air! Glocks down

For everlasting life, you must listen to this
Now you could get with this, or you can get with that
I think you'll go with this, yo Christians where you at?
Oh yes it's KRS, with Church of the Harvest
With Clarence {?}, hip-hop's winning evangelist
And then there's Hezekiah, his fire brings the fire
He's takin it higher, tell 'em {THE DEVIL IS A LIAR}
I know, you thinkin bout that Y2K
And I see, this fear that makes you lose your way
But we got, somethin that is bigger than Benz
And we stand, upon the rock that cannot break
Through millineiums, don't you think we been here before?
Through millineiums, God has always opened the door

You Ain’t Got Time,The World Is MIND,2019.0,"To have once been a criminal, there’s no disgrace
To remain a criminal, is the disgrace (That’s right)

Politics is a pile of tricks
Eight years, what do we get out of it?
More chatter, more gun splatter
More dumb rappers, and dumb athletes and actors
My name’s revolution, open your eyes
I'm not on TV, 'cause the revolution will not be televised
They telling lies, we better rise and get a plan
The US President? He’s endorsed by the Klan
Damn
You don’t understand what’s going on?
Slavery coming back and most of y’all just gonna go along
Not me, they ain’t veiling me
You can see, I ain’t vote for the president or Hillary
America tryin’ to put the fear in ya
They the reason for the fake war there in Syria
So when I grab the mic, I spit a full-clip
Wake up, you ain’t got time for this bullshit

To have once been a criminal, there’s no disgrace (That’s right)
To remain a criminal, is the disgrace (That’s right)
To have once been a criminal, there’s no disgrace (That’s right)
To remain a criminal, is the disgrace (That’s right)

This what the boom bap sound do
Since way back in the Bronx, I had a sound view
If you hearin’ this, the truth, it just found you
I’m in his town, her town, your town too
Man, I stay ahead like a crown do
Look around you
Knowledge reigns supreme, this is what it comes down to
People talkin’, but ain’t doin’ nothin’
KRS ain’t about frontin’, let me tell you somethin’
We need unity at all cost, or everything is all lost
These lessons are hard, that tweeter shit is so soft
Brothers killing brothers killing brothers with the sawed off
No remorse, brothers are hauled off up north
We off course, believe in the hype
Honesty, we ignore; but that deceiving, we like
These rappers are corny, but you like, “He aight”
You lyin’ from the pulpit
You ain’t got time for this bullshit

To have once been a criminal, there’s no disgrace (That’s right)
To remain a criminal, is the disgrace (That’s right)
To have once been a criminal, there’s no disgrace (That’s right)
To remain a criminal, is the disgrace (That’s right)

False Pride,The Sneak Attack,2001,"Okay now, listen to this..
{*sound effect: seagulls*}
A mystical teacher sat by the seaside
It was about five o'clock cause we heard the free ride
Anyway; the teacher was talking in stride
Sitting upon a rock that was wide
And warning against false pride
""Come to where I reside!"" a woman cried
And the teacher replied, ""Do you serve your fish fried?""
""Yes,"" she replied, ""with potato salad on the side.""
And the teacher replied, ""Well where do you reside?""
She said, ""Up on the hillside, it's not a far ride
If you came to have dinner, I would be so gratified.""
The teacher replied, ""It's six o'clock, seven o'clock, you decide.""
She replied, ""Seven o'clock, do you like stir-fried?""
She was mystified and felt so dignified
The teacher was coming to the house where she resides
So she purified with pesticides
{*sound effect: chemicals sprayed*}
Called her friends up nationwide
{*sound effect: phone being dialed*}
Some of her friends were tongue-tied they felt so glorified
She made steamed fish, baked fish, fish that was fried
Soup, steamed vegetables, potato salad on the side
{*sound effect: food cooking*}
You could smell the bread in the oven far and wide
Natural juices and water purified
Organic fruits brought from the countryside
With silver forks and knives placed side by side
{*sound effect: silverware clinks*}
You could not be dissatisfied;
Looking out the window staring at the mountainside
You would have died
6:59 she's swollen with pride
As the moment intensified, there's a knock from outside
{*sound effect: door knocking*}
She opens the door, for the teacher has arrived
{*sound effect: door creaks open*}
But to her surprise, it was a bum who cried
""Please, I smelt the bread from outside!
One piece,"" and then she replied
""The teacher is coming, he's soon to have arrived
You're making me look bad, come on now, step aside!""
The bum then replied
""When I say I'm hungry I haven't lied
Give me some of that chicken that you just fried.""
{*sound effect: food cooking*}
She replied, ""Chicken - fried?
No that's for the teacher, you're not purified""
Then she slammed the door and went back inside
{*sound effect: door closes*}
Sat on the couch with the TV Guide
She looked at the clock, it was 7:09, then 7:30;
He still hasn't arrived
Eight o'clock, she's on the downside
Nine o'clock, by now she's teary-eyed
She's pissed off and her anger multiplied
She cried, then fell asleep dissatisfied
Next day she woke up, and was preoccupied
With meeting the mystical teacher who lied
Where could he hide?
She ran down by the seaside
{*sound effect: seagulls*}
He was there teaching about - false pride
""You lied!"" she replied, ""You lied!
You said you'd be there at seven o'clock, you lied!""
He replied, ""No I have not lied
I came at 6:59, and you told me to move aside
I asked for bread and the chicken that was fried
{*sound effect: food cooking*}
And you said, that I wasn't purified.""
She replied, ""I wasn't notified!
I had no idea that you was the bum that cried!""
And the teacher sighed, then replied
""This concludes our lesson on false pride.""",https://genius.com/Krs-one-false-pride-lyrics
Never Give Up,Spiritual Minded,UnKnown,"Gather 'round, gather 'round, ha
Metaphysical style, spiritual style, the ORIGINAL style, ha
Yes.. let's do it

- you can never give up, you should never give up
- you can never give up, we can never give up
- you can never give up, you can never give up
- you should never give up, we can never give up, you can never give up

Yeah, yeah
Y'all don't really know about the KRS rap
Y'all don't really about why we stay trapped
Y'all don't really know hip-hop ain't rap
But let me tell you how we can get it all back
First realize givin up is wack
Say to yourself I can never be wack
Then realize that we must go back
And the reason you can't seem to get on track
Is you, keep, buying, HOES, simple and plain
You, keep, buying, HOES, all y'all know my name
And how I get down and move around
I've already been to the proving ground
In conscious rap, who rule the sound
The question is are you down?
 w/ minor variations

Look - KRS-One, I've learned already
Everything they doin is temporary
No matter how big you live
You still the creation of a music executive
And when you get old no matter what you did
They throw you away and they pimp your kid
Yeah kids, on the TV whylin
You know why we got racial profilin?
Cause you, keep, buying, HOES, simple and plain
You, keep, buying, HOES, all y'all know my name
So there in the future we'll look back
And then we will see we were under attack
But it'll be too late, the loss'll be too great
You'll see, just wait!
 w/ minor variations

C'mon, c'mon, yeah c'mon
You see how they shuttin down KRS-One
Cause I'm not sexy, thuggin or dumb
Ask yourself -
- why they only promotin criminal activity and nothin else?
On the videos and on the radio
Teachin our kids which way to go
And the way that they tell our kids to go
If you listen, heads right straight to prison
While you, keep, buying, HOES, simple and plain
You, keep, buying, HOES, y'all better peep the game
You got to release that temptation
Get a brand new affirmation
Your life is what you make 'em

Verse One: Thor-El
So you wanna be the million dollar man, kid what's your plan
Make a deal with the devil settle for a hundred grand
Not enough I call your bluff, hit you with the stuff
Deal with this and think you're tough, gimme a call when things get rough
You get no Vette and, if I could stay leaded
I'm leavin rappers one-legged from fakin like the prosthetic
You're artificial by cripple, rap is like your pistol
Grim Reaper, I got the whistle, death I pull no tissue
Hit you, like the Mac-11, MC's subtract by seven
Callin callin for the reverand, lookin at hell like heaven
I'm on the map, makin it like the crazy on the track
Oh what the hell I get my mail while I raid you til it crack
Chorus: KRS and Thor-El
H, I, P, H, O, P, we are
H, I, P, H, O, P, we are
Verse Two: KRS-One
C'mon, uhh
Dead two in the head before some A&R tell me
I must give up the streets you lift the company can sell me
What's the sense in being large if you can't take a risk?
Thinkin a risk upon a disc means you're written off the list
I'm not sayin you can't have your fame and glory just don't bore me
When I come to see you live, and I paid twenty-five
That's, crazy loot Kris is saying I don't play those games
Killing Rhyme Sessions is the meaning of my name
But don't call my name in vain, cause I will appear
And your livest MC will get slain right here
See I do the homework, and I do the extra credit
You could sell a million records, and still can't set it
Cause the Lex or Beem is probably just the matches and a Jeep so
I'm sure your rap career now if they come before your people
Ohh Lord!! You can't be thinkin about Billboard
With the mic cord, and several thousand people just bored
Being dope live is like being insured for life
You always get called back twice, you are

Verse Three: Thor-El, KRS-One
I burn like hy-dra-cho-loric and my city got itty

Woop-woop!
That's the sound of da police!
Woop-woop!
That's the sound of the beast!
Verse One:
Stand clear! Don man a-talk
You can't stand where I stand, you can't walk where I walk
Watch out! We run New York
Police man come, we bust him out the park
I know this for a fact, you don't like how I act
You claim I'm sellin' crack
But you be doin' that
I'd rather say ""see ya""
Cause I would never be ya
Be a officer? You WICKED overseer!
Ya hotshot, wanna get props and be a saviour
First show a little respect, change your behavior
Change your attitude, change your plan
There could never really be justice on stolen land
Are you really for peace and equality?
Or when my car is hooked up, you know you wanna follow me
Your laws are minimal
Cause you won't even think about lookin' at the real criminal
This has got to cease
Cause we be getting HYPED to the sound of da police!
Chorus
Verse Two:
Now here's a likkle truth
Open up your eye
While you're checking out the boom-bap, check the exercise
Take the word ""overseer,"" like a sample
Repeat it very quickly in a crew for example
Overseer
Overseer
Overseer
Overseer
Officer, Officer, Officer, Officer!
Yeah, officer from overseer
You need a little clarity?
Check the similarity!
The overseer rode around the plantation
The officer is off patroling all the nation
The overseer could stop you what you're doing
The officer will pull you over just when he's pursuing
The overseer had the right to get ill
And if you fought back, the overseer had the right to kill
The officer has the right to arrest
And if you fight back they put a hole in your chest!
(Woop!) They both ride horses
After 400 years, I've _got_ no choices!
The police them have a little gun
So when I'm on the streets, I walk around with a bigger one
(Woop-woop!) I hear it all day
Just so they can run the light and be upon their way
Chorus
Verse Three:
Check out the message in a rough stylee
The real criminals are the C-O-P
You check for undercover and the one PD
But just a mere Black man, them want check me
Them check out me car for it shine like the sun
But them jealous or them vexed cause them can't afford one
Black people still slaves up til today
But the Black police officer nah see it that way
Him want a salary
Him want it
So he put on a badge and kill people for it
My grandfather had to deal with the cops
My great-grandfather dealt with the cops
My GREAT grandfather had to deal with the cops
And then my great, great, great, great... when it's gonna stop?!

Keep Flowin’,The World Is MIND,2017.0,"I represent leadership, readership, teachership, speakership
Culture keeper cause the culture we're keeping it
Truth I'm speaking it, critics want to weaken it
Printing gossip and bullshit and the people believing it
Gather 'round now for the freshest guy
If you're new to hip-hop KRS is I
I don't tell no lie, that bullshit that they're talking online
That's the tactics of the FBI
Y'all falling for the same old disunity thing
That's why Malcolm X couldn't link with Dr. King
Why William DuBois was against Marcus Garvey
Together they could have built a strong black army
But not hardly arguments between Bobby Seel and
Huey P. Newton rocked the Black Panther party
We need to wake up these strategies are old
Unity that's the goal let's go

That real shit just keeps flowing
That real shit just keeps going
That real shit just keeps flowing
That real shit just keeps going

Line after line after line after line
Since 1989 I been way ahead of my time
But it's frustrating hearing all the hating and debating
And the faking and the waking, man we got to reawaken
The time that we be wasting, debating and fighting
We can see we unenlightened, man look what we writing
You got the most advanced technology in the palm of your hand
And all you can do is turn around and diss your man
That's like a baby with a loaded gun
Thinking its a load of fun, me, I'm a little older son
We done seen dudes dies and cry and get by
We done seen cops shoot down blacks and just lie
So when Latifah put up U-N-I-T-Y
Why didn't anyone comply, y'all living a lie
The truth is the proof and we got to get it straight

Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up!
We got a whole nation to restore

We gotta really love each other more

When you see my CD in the store
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up!

It's the teacher, class is open G
Let's get open on the concept of voting, we
Begin the discussion by viewing democracy
People power, a people ruled philosophy
Democracy is a system of government
Where the whole population is the sum of it
Where the goverment can't move without its people
Where, before the law, everybody's equal
But take a look at the police and how they treat you
Take a look at these corporations that cheat you
Democrats and Republicans are all see-through
Now we voting for the lesser of two evils
Man, don't let 'em deceive you
This is an autocracy, not a democracy
But to call this a democracy without mock interest
In the laws of society, that's called hypocrisy


Democracy only happened one time
In European history, now keep this in mind
It was practiced in Athens overseas
In 508 B.C. by Cleisthenes
Citizens would get together on a hillside
And decide how and if they was gonna ride
But in 322 B.C. here's what happened
Alexander of Macedon conquered Athens
And that was the end of democracy
Where the people had a say in their society
Today, we gotta get more knowledge
And learn about the function of the electorial college
It doesn't matter who you vote for today
The electorial college has the last say
But that's another day, here's what I came to say
Rise up


In corporate sponsored elections, who's winning?
This the wrong direction from the beginning
Every candidate got scandal, they all sinning
Tryin to convince you, tellin you what they've been in
But the real issues, they get avoided
While our children still gettin exploited
Heh, they call me Blastmaster Kris
Edutainment, that's what my tactic is!
Some criticize Kris, some laugh at Kris
But you can't say Kris is not an activist
Social justice, I got a passion for this
Cause equal rights we still asking for this?
So when I do my tours it's not just rappin for Kris
I'm givin you more than gun packing with this
I'm openin doors, you should be asking 'bout this
You listening to them whores and them capitalists
Their game is tight, got you trapped into this
It won't be long before the ring you like have to kiss
That's why I'm an activist
I help people not to get trapped in this
The temptation? You gettin wrapped in this

KRS-One, Professor Ecks, whattup Dan? Woo
Temple of Hip-Hop, let's do it
By the sound of the track, you know who is back
It's the teacher, philosopher of conscious rap
Rappers tired of me sayin where hip-hop is at
Cause they know they unoriginal, copycats
Watch me bump this gospel rap, never wack
In fact, I tell you where the tracks is at
TV is wack, they wanna show us beatin Iraq
When the question is, is where is Chandra Levy at?

Murdered God and left for dead like hip-hop
And admit to Condit like conduct, to kill Ecks the dread
And Kris crucified the false prophet
John F. Kennedy to these MC's, I draw and cock it
Cock on cocky cops for the love of the art
Punish the part, partition
Pardon the pause, poison pens penetrate the mental
I walk with Kris so my body's a temple
Body instrumentals and body your squad in the body of a God

Just think, just think, what if Malcolm X returned
Or Dr. King returned, tell me what have we learned?
As we takin our turn, tell me what have we earned
Or is the ice and the cars our only concern
Mo' money, mo' money, you be yellin it out
And on TV can't you see you be sellin us out
So in 2010, look to 2002
Who you think they gonna respect, me or you?

Behold, the God, in the form of the man
Walkin off water and (?) flesh absorbs in the sand
Moor gets the land, divorcin the clan, I'm off into sand
Off and I'm slayin delicate arms from porcelain hands
Slaughtered the lambs, charge it to the game
Cats take hip-hop's name in vain
Disrespectin the forefathers who came (uh-huh)
Goddess hurt 'em right now, like when Marvin was slain

They don't want it, nope, they don't need it, nope
Just stay weeded and hope, I don't read what you wrote
Best believe they ain't dope, they deceivin these folks
With they meaningless quotes, I got my feet on they throat
What they speak is a joke, they really weak and they broke
Have a seat and take notes, on the streets I'm the Pope
MTV is they hope, they repeat what they wrote
I'm an MC that won't, let them tempt me with coke

Nope, flesh of my flesh, blessed by KRS
Used to love her, they (?) haven't made a date with death
Follow no man, enslave the Ecks, Professin the student
I vibe with the teacher obliged to drop (?) liver than heaters
Lyrics liable to eat us like the survivors of Jesus
Now the, blind is the leaders, your styles is egregious
Gets now the brow beateth to underground emceeth
The game is overheated, overweeded, and misunderstood

Word, just a ride in they boat, with a platinum rope
No doubt, they sellin us out, what's happenin loc?
Quit this rappin I won't, cause MC'n is dope
If I can't do it for the love then do it I won't
How many times we note when these rappers is dope
Satisfied, that's why I'm renewin your hope
Broaden your scope, when cleaned out your mind
My rhyme is like a new bar of deoderant soap

In this land of men mice and mimes, I holds right for the laws
Live life like Christ, makin bread from mics and applause
The snakes fight with Tyson like jaws for what's rightfully yours
I might (?) 'em all, tell me - is it life or it's war?

You think this is easy right? (That's easy!)
You think you got what it takes? (Yeah that's easy!)
Huh, we gon' see.. we gon' see right now (Now what?)
Look

So you wanna be a conscious rapper
Can you handle the press and they negative chatter
Can you eat cold platters, and still spit data
Watchin others spit lies and they pockets get fatter
Can you climb up the ladder, and reach the top?
But it still doesn't matter, cause you ain't pop
Can you rock for the love of the art
Can you drop hit after hit after hit and still don't chart?
Can you REALLY stay loyal to God
When your life is full of strife, plus it always seems so hard
Can you handle the criticism
People holdin you up to higher standards, but they don't live 'em?
Can you hear these kiddy flows and laugh at it
But when you spit they callin you arrogant?
You better think about that before you rock to this
Sometimes it's easier to pop your Cris', let's do it!

Think you can do what I do
Think you can step in my shoes
You have no clue what I go through
You never felt my pain
When they attack my name
All because I have spoken the truth

To be a conscious rapper ain't a mystery
You gotta laugh when they call you contradictory
The whole industry,
 you gotta push and pull it
To really get with me, you gotta dodge they bullets
Blaow, blaow, blaow, every day and every way
You critics got somethin to say
At the same time, you gotta uphold Christ
Uphold life, while others flash cars and ice
It could break you down, take you down, make you frown
It could actually shake your ground
But if you love who you are, and believe in that
Best believe you will BE where the teacher's at
And where's that? In fact, in cold or heat
Yes, I declare victory over the streets
Overstand, over these beats, over the so-called elite
Over the strong, over the weak
I know how to speak, and most of all I know how to eat
I know I want humble and meek
So you better think about that before you rock to this
Sometimes it's easier to pop your Cris', uhh


Look!
So you thinkin about bein a concious MC
Well you gotta love God and you got to live free
You got to see the life that others can't see
You got to be the person that others can't be
You can't be a S-L-A, V-E
If you sayin to yourself, ""This may be me""
Then you know goin in that you work against sin
Your very skills will kill the demons within
So don't expect respect from slaves and hoes
Nor the slavemaster's video shows
Nor the rap mags, you know how it go
Nor the slavemaster's video shows
Nor the rap mags, you know how it go
Especially black mags, you know they don't know
Just go to the crowd that you know will need you
Cause NOTHING compares to the respect of the people
That's what you look for, that's what you work with
Cause anything else, is truly worthless
You better think about that before you rock to this
Sometimes it's easier to just pop your Cris'
You better think about that, 'fore you rock to this
Sometimes it's easier to just pop your Cris', uhh

You better hope these Christians are wrong cause you goin to hell
Think about that when you're spittin your raps
And you call out KRS, I'll put you flat on your back
You're not HOT, all you do is talk a lot
That's not HOT, where's your respect on the block?
That's HOT, not cause you're friends with the cops
That's not HOT, a real MC you're not
What's HOT?

If you don't move back we're gonna turn this music off
And that's my word, move back!

Say fuck yeah!          FUCK YEAH!
Word up, it's the Funk Doc Spock you don't stop
It's my man KRS you don't stop
It's the girl Angie you don't stop
With the hah haha ha haha hah!!

It's the Butter Pecan Rican speakin', deletin'
Other radio jocks that think they competin'
They pre-sweetened, like candy, I'm hot like pepper
Big up to Sandy but my name is Angie
Martinez, what a true microphone fiend is
Steppin up lovely with MY, A...DIDAS
Through your speakers, representin
Boriquas, and all hip-hop rhyme seekers
You may think I'm crazy right, but I'm crazy hype
Slay this nice y'all, everytime Angie grab the mic
I jams it right tonight, not the hardest
But peep the style of this Puerto Rican Goddess

Aiyyo yo yo yo, stop the music!
Aiyyo back up off the ropes, man, word up!
Yo get from the off the ropes
Now aiyyo yo yo, KRS-One, come again the selector!

It's been a long time but we made it, you waited
You gettin frustrated cause these MC's in trainin
Skills on the mic for a royalty save it
Pullin down rap so that others can't make it
They can't fake it in front of KRS they naked
That same old MC trend I'm here to break it
The highly conceptional multidirectional
Hot in ninety-seven so I guess I'm flexible
Rap relieve stress so yes I guess it's medical
All your wrecking and raping is still theoretical
Redman, you know you must understand (Whatup?)
Redman, you know you gots to understand (Hah! Whatup love?)
Angie, rockin with the one BDP (Ha, haha)
Representin right now at Hit Factory

One two hah, and you don't quit
It's Kris and Angie with the ultimate
One two hah, and you don't quack
It's Funk Doc smoke weed and don't smoke crack
Hahaha, hah, and you don't quit
Hoohahhahah, and you don't quit
I rock jams like, Samsonites with mics
Stage two boomin system and flood the lights
The lyrical, fo'-fo's lettin off like suppose
Reggie Reg is rockin on the ra-dioooo!
Hahh, huh, the oooh-child too chill
Caps peeled, Someone In My Bed like Dru Hill
Raise em up, cause I feel my spot can't be touched
No time for the Pauline jack, hit the clutch
Shotgun what?? It's the high exalted
Ruler of the buddha, the cash make my pockets
Stick out like a tumor, for the consumers
I get busy with La Pluma, detonate the bomb
To make you hibernate sooner, certified luna-tic
My click run deeper than Charlie Tuna
Kahunas, raw for the able key movers
All over the hood like them Crooked I coolers
Bang maneuvers, from Jerz to Vancouver
Back to the Bronx with heartbeats ample looped up
I Blastmast like Kris, funk abyss
Like a phone chauvenist with a Roley on the wrist

That's how you get fucked up!!
Gettin head in the bed with another man's wife
That's how you get fucked up!!
You better always think twice how you're livin your life
That's how you get fucked up!!

People walk around just, in a daze and oblivious
To them demons that live in us
Who can you really trust
Is it them demons that got us schemin or is it really us?
People really fuss, and them guns really bust
Brothers dyin over silly stuff
Them streets can get really tough
They ain't playin man, you better {get what I'm sayin}

When you can't forgive and all you spit is negative
That's how you get fucked up!!
When you're dissin your elders and cheatin your relatives
That's how you get fucked up!!
Messin with a man's crib, kids or wife
That's how you get fucked up!!
You better think twice how you're livin your life, cause
That's how you get fucked up!!

Got security tellin these people to move back
I got two new tracks, somethin new from DAT's
Tunnel Rats with Proper and Triune in the back
I don't move with a pack, I move membership
Hip-Hop we livin it and what I'm doin is rap
But cats wanna talk that crap
'Til they see that I'm not playin, you better {get what I'm sayin}
Everyday more betrayin, more lyin, and from friends
More crime and more revenge - HUSH
Things are really rough; cause there's really no one out there
That I doubt that you can really trust
Them guns bust - how many hustlers gotta die
Go to jail for a fiend to get a rush?
From ashes to dust, that man of lust
Is decayin, you better {get what I'm sayin}

Talkin that crap behind another man's back
That's how you get fucked up!!
Spittin gossip and scandal and don't have facts
That's how you get fucked up!!
Bein caught in the hype, flashin off your ice
That's how you get fucked up!!
You better always think twice how you're livin your life cause
That's how you get fucked up!!

I'mma close it out, cause all my foes they doubt
I'm rollin out, they know what I'm all about
I don't roam about, I appear and shout
I wear 'em out, then we clear 'em out
I steer the route to where the end be at
Where the peace, where the love, where my friends be at
Where the jealous ones envy that
And they start betrayin, that's right you better {get what I'm sayin}

If you schemin a lot on what another man's got
That's how you get fucked up!!

Criminal Minded,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Boogie Down Productions will always get paid
We'll take the wackest song and make it better
Remember to let us into your skin
'Cause then you'll begin to master
Rhymin', rhymin', rhymin'
Criminal minded, you've been blinded
Lookin', for a style like mine you can't find it
They are the audience I am the lyricist
Sometimes the suckas on the side gotta hear this
Page, a rage and I'm not in a cage
Free as a bird to fly up out on stage
Ain't here for no frontin', just to say a little somethin'
Ya suckaz don't like me 'cause you're all about nothin'
However, I'm really fascinatin' to the letter
My all around performance gets better and better
My English grammar comes down like a hammer
You need a style, I need to pull your file
I don't beg favors, you're kissin' other people's
I write and produce myself just as fast
Keep my hair like this, got no time for Jheri curls
Attractin' only women, got no time for little girls
'Cause girls look so good
But their brain is not ready, I don't know
I'd rather talk to a woman
'Cause her mind is so steady, so here we go
I'm not a musical maniac or b-boy fanatic
I simply made use of what was upstairs in the attic
I've listened to these MC's back when I was a kid
But I bust more shots than they ever did
I mean this is not the best of KRS, it's just a section
But how many times must I point you in the right direction
You need protection, when I'm on the mic
Because my mouth is like a 9 millimeter windpipe
You're a king, I'm a teacher, you're a b-boy, I'm a scholar
If this was a class well, it would go right under drama
See kings lose crowns but teachers stay intelligent
Talkin' big words on the mic but still irrelevant
Especially when you're not, college material
Wake up every mornin' to your Lucky Charms cereal
DJ Scott LaRock has a college degree
Blastmaster KRS writes poetry
I won't go deeper in the subject 'cause that gets me bored
It's a shame to know some MC's on the mic are fraud
Sayin' styles like this to create a diss
But if you listen, who you dissin'? See I am a musician
Rappin' on the mic like this to me is fine
'Cause if I really want to battle I will put out a nine
You can see that Scott LaRock and I are mentally binded
In other words we're both criminal minded
We're not promoting violence, we're just havin' some fun
He's Scott LaRock, I'm KRS-One
Never off-beat 'cause it don't make sense
Grab the microphone, relaxed and not tense
You waited, debated and now you activated
A musical genius that could not be duplicated
See I have the formula for rockin' the house
If you cannot rock a party do not open your mouth
It's that simple, no phony cosmetics to your pimple
Take another look because the gear is not wrinkled
The K, the R, the S, the O, the N, the E
Sayin' rhyme for eighty-seven not from 1983
Well versed, to rehearse and my rhymes are my curse
Originality come first but the suckers get worse
Allow me to include I have a very stable mood
Poetic education of a high altitude
I'm not an MC, so listen, call me poet or musician
A genius when it comes to makin' music with ambition
I'm cool, collected with the rhyme I directed
Don't wanna be elected as the king of a record
Just respected by others as the man with the solution
An artist of the 80's came and left his contribution
On wax, relax, there's 24 tracks
After years of rockin' parties now I picked up the knack
Because everythin' that flows from out my larynx
Takes years of experience and bottles of Beck's
I cannot seem to recollect the time I didn't have sex
Is it real or is it Memorex?
I'm livin' in a city known as New York State
Sucka MC's gotta wait while I translate
I hang with real live dreads with knowledge in their heads
People with ambition and straight up musicians
Although our lives have been so uprooted
I have it included, you all get zooted
So take each letter of the KRS-One
Means knowledge reigns supreme over nearly everyone
You look at me and laugh, but this is your class
It's an all-out discussion of the suckas I be crushin'
So now you are awakened to the music I be makin'
Never duplicated, and also highly cultivated
Don't get frustrated 'cause nothin' has been traded
Only activated, it came out very complicated
Not separated, from my DJ, you see my voice is now faded
I'll see you folks around the way, criminal minded
Criminal minded, criminal minded, criminal minded",https://genius.com/Krs-one-criminal-minded-lyrics

Watch my signal, I rock the rap game like Nintendo
Hey diddle, diddle, get played now like a fiddle
I watch you wiggle, in front of the audience that was fickle
Now you can't make a nickle, the sour pickle you are

Or at the studio, or home studyin

As he wrecks turntable sets with many subjects
Huff now that's the Blastmaster connects, the larynx
To a high-tech mic set, you get what you get
Tech and Sway, index of singles is complex
On Technics sets, he wrecks, collects a fee next
While you rejects practice, suffix and prefix

Embrace the papers, land of money makers
Brothers hate us cause the brothers ain't us
Yo yo, from coast to coast I'mma overdose you and BDP you
And Kris-Kross your mind, wouldn't wanna be you

Womenology,Prophets vs. Profits,2002,"If you want a woman to treat you right

That's right, that's right
I think y'all need to listen to this, stop what'cha doin

Women will treat you right
But you can't be one of them lookin to freak lookin to beat you type
You gotta seek the light in the dark
I used to free this mic in the park
Now I speak direct to your heart
Women want men to show respect for they art
Women don't be checkin for the chart
They go straight to sister to sister and pick it apart
Begin with the heart, our sisters is a living art
Always givin, always deliverin, always making something bigger from just a little part
Big up to the sisters that start up businesses
With nothing but muffins, still liftin kids
Strong women ,work long women
Not them dump-ass dizzy stupid thong women
King-Kong women, bring it all women, independent women with thoughts & opinions
Women like G.Simone, See, I maybe the Pharaoh
But believe she is the crown Let me leave it alone
Cause a lot of ya still wanna rome, they got houses but still want home
Sittin on chrome but forever alone
Cause intelligent courageous women they were never shown
They say they don't love them hoes
But Jesus allowed hoes to wash in all his toes
I don't mean to impose, but if you want a woman to treat you right
I don't think you need to start with the clothes
I think you need to start with what she knows


That's what you got to know from the start
Whats in the heart & the mind
Without that you startin out blind
You're going into a direction of what a trap ???? behind
Its like you sittin in a cell with the doors opened
And you decide to sit and do the time
Free your mind, don't pattern your life after some freestyle rhyme
See me, I'm...",https://genius.com/Krs-one-womenology-lyrics
The Mind,The Sneak Attack,2001,"First thing we must do is make up our - MIND
Then we must go and really clear our - MIND
Erase the doubt and the fear from our - MIND
Share our - MIND, speak our - MIND

Stand up brother, stand up sister
I told y'all before, love is gonna get'cha
Lovin that money
, 
lovin that liquor
Lovin that sex without respect you gets no bigger
I ain't got time to chill, only got time to build
You find that in those with skills
This a real MC, of the highest degree
With no video, my show they dyin to see
Not whether I'm buyin 'em three
When you watch television just keep sayin they lyin to me
Cause they are - how long you gonna stay at the bar?
I'm not desperate for money, maybe you are, but listen


Don't you think it's time we thought about the future?
Whether our children they gonna be winners or losers?
Don't you think it's time to advance the rhyme we spit?
Whether you know it or not, you deep in politics
All inside of it, in fact YOU the issue
Don't let this government diss you!
They really do not want you to vote
They really do not want you to hope
They really want you sniffin' they coke
You look around yo we missin' the boat
I could've wrote about ANYTHING to get on, but this what I wrote
And what I'm writin', is guaranteed to enlighten
Like Dr. Cornel West
, 
Michael Eric Dyson
This is how we do it today, enough of the crime talk
KRS got somethin' new to say
Rise up, and put aside childish things
This is the message we bring; listen


Last verse, KRS, blast first
Ignorance is bad, but temptation that's worse
They hide they purse, cause of the way we spit the verse
No one ever told 'em that the style's rehearsed
And even if they did, it wouldn't be new to they mind
Cause all day rappers confess to doin' these crimes
So when the cops see you, they're not thinkin' about me
They thinkin' about takin' you out of society
Keep it right, don't lie to me
You think it's too much preachin' teachin'?
Huh, well fine, we'll see
When you're locked up in J.D.C., or even prison
The truth shall set you free, just listen
You want health, and really that's about prevention
You want love, real love, and not depression
You want awareness, which come from discipline and will
You want wealth, which come from skills
When you really ready to talk, let's build
You ain't gotta be a scholar to know the next 4 years gonna be ill
I believe you already know the drill, don't lie
Don't steal, seek peace and don't kill",https://genius.com/Krs-one-the-mind-lyrics
Tears,Spiritual Minded,UnKnown,"""At midday today, some Americans attended memorial services
For victims of Tuesday's acts of terrorism. Thousands
Gathered at Chicago's Daily Plaza. Hundreds more looked
On from the windows of surrounding office buildings
Many waved flags, and traffic came to a complete standstill
On the rooftop of City Hall, which faces Daily Plaza, a
Police sharpshooter watched the crowd, even as he saluted
The flag. After a minute of silence, church bells rang.""
{Ain't no need in all the tears, oh no no, yeah yeah
Yeah cause things will be better tomorrow}

No need for tears, no need to cry
No matter what we face, we shall get by
When the problems you face are too much to bear
Know I'll be there

Hold that head up y'all, don't get fed up y'all
C'mon let's get up y'all
Make that bed up y'all, life is a set-up y'all
Sadness comes from a lack of knowin, not knowin
Where the one that you love is goin
We all gonna reap what we all are sewin
There is no death, just constant growin
We can't stay here forever
We all gotta go to a place we believe is better
So why be sad, why be mad
Now you can see it ain't about the cheddar
It's all about the time that we spend together
Not the rhyme or the crime or the Gucci sweater
The house that's built on a rock can stand the weather
Faith, can stand the weather
But is your house, upon the rock
Or is it on sand and about to drop
Here is the question that you got to ask
Do I live for today or do I live for the past?
Think fast, but do not hurry
Life is a class and we should not worry
But tell me, how long you gonna ignore
Tell me how long you gonna ignore God's law?
How long can you really endure
Livin like pimps, livin like whores
The choice is yours, or really ours
Think about this while you lay the flowers
On the grave, uh, let's talk about how you behave, uh
Do you come out the neighb' or out the cave?
Better change your ways, we comin up on some stranger days


Uhh, uhh
Don't step where the danger lays or danger lies
Open them EYES UP, better to RISE UP, WISE UP
Raise your MINDS UP
Look to the left, look to the right
Pray in the day and the night
Be prepared for the fight, not scared of the fight
He's the way, the truth AND the light
J to the E to the S to the U to the S
You can remove the stress
Yes, we do need you here
Yes, we wanna be free from fear
Yes, we wanna start seein clear
Havin you here, not over there
Lookin around sayin where, does anybody care?
Yeah, I'll be there
At the door, not at the war
At Matthew 5:44
""But I say, unto you
Love your enemies, bless them that curse you
Do good to them that hate you
And pray for them which despitefully use you
And persecute you""
This goes for them terrorists too
But them publicans, done put themSELVES up above again
Lookin for blood again, hate no love again
Got them soldiers runnin in, with a gun again
With a ton of sin, in a holy war, how we gonna win?
I think it's time for KRS-One again
 - repeat 2X

The time is now, you gotta make your choice
Which side are you on?
 Turn now to Matthew 5:46
""For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye?
Do not even the publicans the same?
And if ye salute your breddern only, what do ye more than others
Do not even the publicans so? Be ye therefore perfect;
Even as your FATHER which is in heaven, is perfect.."" {*echoes*}",https://genius.com/Krs-one-tears-lyrics
It’s All a Struggle,Kristyles,2003," + (guest)
It's all a struggle (tryin to make it day to day)
It's all a struggle (from my hood to around your way)
It's all a struggle (single parents all by theyself)
It's all a struggle (diseases decreasin your health)
It's all a struggle (fiends swearin that's they last puff)
It's all a struggle (hustler tryin to avoid handcuffs)
(No matter what you do, who you are or where you from)
(Rich poor black white, at the end of the day)

It's all a struggle - and most people's struggles are doubled
You ain't the only one with a challenge facing some trouble
Look at the woman chewed up by the dog with no muzzle
Or the workers that got trapped underground in that tunnel
Some kids are playing in pools, others in puddles
When they listen to the news the propoganda is subtle
But it's time for you to know that the cryin got to go
Release the guilt that you built and let it flow
Slow and low, that is the tempo
Move slow and on the low, this you gotta know
You don't get the muscles without the hard struggles
You ain't the only one out here tryin to get dough
From the hustler to the preacher to the government leaders
From the airline pilot to the chef to the teachers
We linked in the same huddle, in the same tussle'n'bustle
Cause at the end of the day, it's all a struggle


It's all a struggle - but don't let the challenges bug you
Or the government drug you, or the thieves in the street
Beat and mug you - build your tunnel under the rubble
Come up on the other side eye to eye with the trouble
Look at the Twin Towers crumble
Look at the religious leadership stumble, everybody struggles
But not everybody comes through nifty, it's fifty/fifty
The city itself will outrun you quickly
Whether you be healthy or sickly
Whether you be wealthy or thrifty, ugly or pretty
Everybody's tryin to get 50's and 100's
I taught this at UCLA just off Sunset
Now run get ""Ruminations""
It's a book that I published for the healing of this nation
In just a few chapters we run through, some possible solutions
Cause at the end of the day


It's all a struggle",https://genius.com/Krs-one-its-all-a-struggle-lyrics

And carry the flame, the torch, the name?
Millenium games, it's all the same
Sinners repent, many for fear
End of the year, everyone cheers
Only a few hear my voice in they ears
Everyone else well they really don't care
But what if I told you I could read the future
And in the future, they the losers
We the winners, cause they the sinners
Well it's all mathematics, can I eat my dinner
And think (think) why was I made to link
Between them and the universe; battle, who the first?
I don't really care, cause I'm really not here
I'm showin you skill, but you still sayin ""Where?""

The bass in your face, the highs in your eyes
Will make you real-IZE
If you down with the Temple of Hip-Hop, you not no average GUY, or girl
C'mon take a critical look in my world
See the metaphysical books that I twirl and twist
Forces the ventriloquist

While the hip-hop nation repeats my hooks
All I wanna see is y'all healthy and wealthy

About the pimps and the hoes, players and the clothes
You gets no money if you got no flow, no skill

I got the lingo, ling ling, the lingo
The lingo, ling ling, the lingo
I got that lingo, ling ling, the lingo
The lingo, ling ling

I got that lingo, the street lingo I bring yo
Acronology now the society to bring to
Too many people think so
I'm not just an O.G., I'm an Original Hustler, you like, ""OH!""
Follow Life's Outcome Willingly, that's FLOW
WISDOM, When I Simply Decide on Moe, or More
I'm bringin' it to raw like a razor
FAITH, Focus And Ignore These Haters
Acronology is dope
Here is another one for FAITH, write it down, ""For All It Takes, Hope""
Broaden your scope, it's Tha Teacha', you heard of me
I represent the struggle in the 'hood most certainly
But STRUGGLE's more than a word to me
Here's a Situation That Reminds Us God's Grace Lasts Eternally
LADY, Love And Develop Yourself
HLAW, Health, Love, Awareness, and Wealth
Acronology is not just BRB or Be Right Back
You gotta check the words you usin'
Like RELIGIOUS
It could mean Realizing Every Life In God's Image Offers Useful Solutions
So why you cruisin' lookin' for a snack
Think DIET, ""Did I Eat That?""
Put down the cake, Seek Help And Proper Exercise
Rewind that, that spells SHAPE
These definitions go beyond the intellect
Like MIND, ""May I Now Direct?""
A new philosophy called acronology
I say it the word, the word inside of me, oh!
The heat is on, you can't leave it alone
This whole thing's created by G. Simone
Even KRS is a acronym
It means, ""Knowledge Reigns Supreme,"" spin it back again

I got the lingo, ling ling, the lingo
The lingo, ling ling, the lingo
I got that lingo, ling ling, the lingo
The lingo, ling ling

You can have so much fun with this
You can even take offensive words and give it a twist
Like BITCH, offensive to the ear
Now switch it, ""Because I Take Charge Here!""
With acronology, you gotta win
Here's another one for BITCH, ""Because I Totally Challenged Him
Or Her,"" you can't stop the edutainment
'Cause these types of rhymes keep you out of your enslavement
It might not hit you or overstand
I'm takin' you HOME, ""Here Our Mind Expands""
So before Departin'  Earth Aimin' for the Heavens
Which spells DEATH, you need to check these life lessons
They like weapons, the foundation is under me
I open up your mind to see how others see
Like GOSSIP, Givin' Out Someone's Secret Information Publicly
Or MUSLIM, May U See Love In Me
I see the CROSS and ask my wife
She says, ""it's a Constant Reminder Of Self-Sacrifice""
This is acronology, brothers and sisters
You FAMILY, For All My Intelligence, Love Ya

Hiiiip-Hop

Yo - we went from nuttin to somethin, bein real and not frontin
No one was givin us nuttin so we resorted to gunnin
Growin up and we comin, up the ladder not bummin
Dodgin warrants and summons, from the cops we were runnin
Goin to school not for nuttin they teachin lies and assumptions
And they tell us keep comin, comin to school now for what? When
Comin back to a system that's whack and really not runnin
Oh I'm sorry it's runnin, it's not PROPERLY runnin
It's a conspiracy hear me man it's got to be somethin
I can get guns faster than I can get an english muffin
And the black church ain't sayin nuttin
We on our own cousin, I'm stickin to this


I'm livin for this hip-hop, I'm spittin for this hip-hop
I'm givin to this hip-hop, my life is hip-hop
Culture, and y'all know that
Hip-Hop in the media, y'all know it's whack
But just like them dopefiends who keep comin back
Like the mayor of D.C., buyin Joey's crack
No disrespect to either one of them but look at that
Study the metaphors in this rap
We bigger than crack, but we keep buyin it
We bigger than rap, but we keep denyin it
Justice, equality, keep cryin it
But the only way to get it is to start applyin it
Fat Joe that's my bro shows 'nuff respect
Talib, that's my bro, shows 'nuff respect
50 Cent that's my bro he shows 'nuff respect
Common! That's my bro he shows 'nuff respect
Snoop Dogg is my bro showed 'nuff respect
Dead Prez that's my peeps yo 'nuff respect
Cassidy's an MC who shows 'nuff respect
Hip-Hop is one, don't forget
I'm stickin with this


I'm livin for that hip-hop culture, shape it like a sculpture
Touch it why don'tcha, touch it why don'tcha
Hip-Hop is yours and mine and that's fine
But hip-hop's culture ain't about just crime
You caught up in the image and, don't know they rhymes
You caught up in they bodies and don't know they minds
So I'm, here to bring the truth in the place
Like don't think Common won't punch you in your face~!
And don't think Talib won't hold the heat
To stop the violence you gotta know your street
You gotta know who Tanga Reed is
Fat Joe's a leader, Busta Rhymes a preacher
KRS-One's a teacher
But through Cassidy my lessons are quicker to reach ya
We one community
I'm talkin about unity, in other words you and me
I'm with this

How many times did you pre-meditate
What you thought was your fate, cause you couldn't just wait
You had to have it the way that you thought in your mind
But in the end, everything came in time
But before the time, you was losin your mind
You was racin and rushin and fallin behind
But let me tell you bout God and the way that She works
I mean the way that He works, I mean the way that We work
You gotta trust in your Lord, everything is in accord
Don't rush or fuss, you gonna get yours
Close your eyes, your heart, your ears, your mind
To the ways and thoughts of mankind
And seek ye first the Kingdom of God
And things won't seem so hard
You gotta trust your Lord, uhh, uhh.. tell 'em bout

Trust and obey, trust when afraid
Trust when you paid, trust when betrayed
Trust when you fear, trust when you unclear
Trust when you here, trust when you near
Trust when you down, trust when you found
Trust when you clown, trust
C'mon, let's do it again, uh, uh
Let's raise it up, c'mon, look

After you live and you learn then you see
You will learn how to trust in your G-O-D
You will be so free, you won't see no me
You will only see the will of the almighty
You sick of what? Well ya will, give it up
Stop thinkin and begin to, live it up
Everytime you think it's one way it's not
Everytime you wanna start you really stop
Trust in the inner the outer is for the sinners
In fact this whole rap is for beginners
Those that have talked and walked upon the path
Know that they get what they want before they act
So why rush, if your respect is due
Whatever you DON'T have is protectin you
Here's what you DO have that be bringin the drama
Ask and it shall be given, with a comma

So when will you be it, when will you see it
That thoughts and things they manifest when you decree it
But God be lookin out for you
Puttin a stop to what you're about to do
In your life, and in your circumstances
Everytime you speak you be takin chances
Talkin bout things that you really don't have to have
So when you get 'em, your life turns sad
Your life turns bad, now why would your God be allowin that?
Trust in God, that's where the crown is at
It's not in what you get, it's what happens after that
So if you think your life is shrinkin
It may be cause you keep thinkin

You, me, or themselves you can tell, they livin in hell
But they come on the TV lookin so swell
Sellin you dreams of schemes of you gettin green and cream
But they never explain the work and all it means
You got to visualize, close the lid on your eyes
And visualize, minimize lies
See yourself bigger in size, quicker to rise up
Wise up climb up, before your time's up but

 The votes
 That's right
 The politics
 That's right
 The government you know!
 Uh-huh, people basically have the government they want
 If people felt dissed, they'd be out rebellin right now",https://genius.com/Krs-one-why-lyrics
Dream,Keep Right,2004,"The God of your understanding, has chosen you and you've agreed
To be here in this space and time to do something, that only you can do
Now I won't stand here to try and tell you what it is
But deep, inside yourself
As you take time to uncover, and ask yourself some vital questions
Like - what is it that brings me peace, what is it that brings me joy?
What do I love doing?
What am I willing to become highly skilled at doing?
What part can I play for the betterment of the society
And the world in which I want to live?
When you begin to ask yourself those real questions
And it doesn't have to be done in a formal way
It can be done just like we're speaking, right now
Ask yourself the question
Look at how you see yourself in just a year from now
And then go forward
And if you have children or even if you don't have children
Now begin to, look at your future beyond
The space and time that you are
Now visualize exactly, the way that you desire to live
Don't be afraid to, dream",https://genius.com/Krs-one-dream-lyrics

Don't stop and switch a temple, let's work and build a city

If I'm the God of rap and you battling me, you Satan
And that's why you hating, creating debates

Bright I shine, simply cuz I'm
Lyrically be kicking out the tighter rhyme, till I climb
Bring in the chime, in your mind, you fall behind
Picking up your rhyming skill, I am fulfilled, when I kill at will
Still number one for fun, kill another one
Battle your bugging son
Look I cut your tongue, KRS-One is never done
I am the proper one, this ass-whipping will make you better son
Go and tell your mum I took a bite out of your bum
Anytime you want it, doggone it, yo put me on it
Never running up on it, you never disappointed, get on it
I simply jam, not that I give a damn
Let me tell you who I am, just ask your buddy
Put your cash on Kris, I bet you double up your money
You can call me Chris Rock, ain't nothing funny
Nigga what, let me change my style up, in a rough
Nigga duck, dropped your face, pick it up, shook 'em up
Automatic fire - Brrrrrrrruh! Brrrrrrrruh!
All up in the party, clip it out, give it up
Where's the money for this single? Get it out, give it up

Perfect fit now, now clown, who the shit now?
Fo'-fo' aimed at your dome, bout to spit rounds
Me and you, getting it on? Don't even go there
Once I bring it to you, you won't be save nowhere
Oh yeah, your mom's funeral don't even show there
It'll be a double burial dukes, when the smoke clears
Love you like a brother, but I'll kill you if you rally
Stay on my good side, my bad side, I annihilate
Don't hold me back, get off me, told these cats never cross me
But they crossed the line, I gotta show 'em
My fo'-fo' snub is what I owe 'em, Kris you know him? (Nah)
Ice pick, Attica style, I'm bout to blow him
Dudes get trifle, catch the barrel of the rifle
Fuck you, until more niggas looking just like you
Dump two when you hear me squeeze off the cycles
I squeeze you load (I squeeze you reload)
I squeeze you reload till this whole shit can roll
Where I'm from, that's the code, BDP got your shit sold
Like bad heads that fold at war, anything goes

All my people in Boston make some noise
Whew! Inebriated Beats. You got to Believe

Believe it

Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Look, Look
All my rap is street related
How can you spit and not have it hit the pavement?
These beats we created be inebriated
Meaning intoxicating, believe we made it
Now we can see they faded
Them hoes done went from me so horny to me so hated
From Hip Hop, we never deviated
Come to the Temple, hear the flow and you can see me state it
That Knowledge Reign Supreme
I be on the same streets, with them same hustlers and fiends
But Hip Hop, do you know what it means?
It means victory over the streets, check the last Beat Street scene
I leak knowledge, inner-standing, wisdom
KRS the type that get you outta the prison
Elite knowledge, inner-standing, wisdom
KRS the type that get you outta the prison, Believe


Yo, Yo, Believe it
I only come to help you achieve it
You could believe what you want, you can take it or leave it
Slow it up or speed it, but never mind if you dont need it
But I still gotta teach it, I still gotta speak it
There's more to the streets than guns and stuff
To all my fathers, you know one sons enough
But if you have two or three
You know they get -gasm what they see on the t.v
You gotta believe me
We gotta rise up
All my daughters I beg, close your legs and kind of like open your minds up
Before your times up, and you find what?
You was just another stepping stone for him to climb up
I'm what? A player? No
A ho? No. An average rhyme-sayer? No
A neighbor? Yes. A friend of the Savior? Yes
I can honestly say I'm blessed


Yo, its a Hip Hop intellectual heavyweight
That leaves 'em in a truly inebriated state
If you thinking about leaving, you better wait
We only talking about freedom and showing love instead of hate
But no, you dont think it's real
Until you're shackled 'round your wrists and your ankles and your heels
You could brag if you feel
But don't forget to mention the twenty to life is part of the deal
When the DEA flash that shield
The bigger they are as stars
Huh... the harder they squeal
And usually your name comes out
Leading to that knock on the door, and you being led out
That's when my lyrics matter
All them guns and bitches and hoes, you don't wanna hear them rappers
That's when you wanna hear pastors
But if you listen now, you can like avoid them disasters
Turn your life over to God today
Not a little bit, Yo, go all the way
I said, turn your life over to God today
Not a little bit, Yo, go all the way Yo


It's live like that ya'll
It's live just like that

Confederate flag (bring it down)
Symbols of human enslavement
Confederate flag (bring it down)
But what about the red, white and the blue
American flag (bring it down)
Racists flew that flag when they captured you
American flag

I ain't here for selling shit
Me I came for telling it
I tell it like it is
So my people stay intelligent
We ending it
Racism, slavery, we ending it
This is why we bringing down the flag of the confederate
I share the same sentiment: Slavery is bad
But slavery was established by the american flag
Follow me
The american flag it flew in every colony
To break down the confederate only ia a hypocrisy
You bringing down one flag to raise up another
When both flags ensalved my sisters and my brothers
Yea man there were others
African, french, the portuguese
The english, the spanish, enslavers for all of these
So why raise any flag that killed my mom and my dad
Invaded my lands with plans to take up all that they had
I'm glad, the confederate flag is banned today
But the American flag is still flown by the KKK

Symbols of injustice and hatred
Confederate flag (you gots to bring it down)
Symbols of human enslavement
Confederate flag (you gots to bring it down)
But what about the red, white and the blue
American flag (you gots to bring it down)
Racists flew that flag when they captured you
American flag

KRS, the right teacha
In the street I might see ya
Under the American flag blacks had no rights either
Women had no rights either, natives had no rights either
White abolitionist had to fight against white preacher
Red, white and blue should mean red, white and black
Blue was our indigo color, coming from way back
But the system is racist, when the murderers are acquitted
So we ride in the streets, then you say we shouldn't have did it
""they destroying their cty"", man you don't get it
If this was my city I wouldn't be getting shot in it
Stopped in it, harressed, unemployed and always locked in it
While the guns, the polution and drugs are always trapped in it
Turn the tv off man, don't listen to all that
You a global citizen, you got to know all the facts
You a global citizen, you got to know how to act
Ask yourself, what does the American flag mean to Iraq?",https://genius.com/Krs-one-american-flag-lyrics

Any MC test BDP sound we a bun it
They just begun it, we the veteran
Better than any of them and we keep it 100
I'm the blast master but faster
I'm the same that influenced the game I'm named after

What is a real hip-hop MC?
Is it MTV?
Is it BET?
Is it five M-I-C's so the people can see?
I mean, how you think you're free when you act like property?
Tell me, how do you judge an MC when he's rockin'?
I mean, rockin' it live, not pickin his cotton?
I mean, adjusting his clothes? I mean, how do you know
Before you come to the show that you're not gettin heated?
That you're not gettin cheated?
That you ain't come to the club thinkin', 'I must've been weeded'?
(Word)
You got to be a educated consumer
Spend your money on MC's 'cause these rappers'll do ya
All they want is your cash, ass, grass, gas and a flick
When you ask for that autograph they ass-dash quick
Beware of the rapper, he talks like it don't matter
He pulls his gat while we bust off the gat-ler

This is ""The Sneak Attack""
The ""Edutainment"" style returns like that
Take it off your shelf
'Cause all we deal wit is knowledge of self, health and wealth
Not Stealth bombers, leather goose bombers
Original hip-hop armor on cd-rom - uh
You got to get with a
21st century philosopher
Representin' the religion of hip-hop sir
Those that oppose are foes and will get rocked - uh
Stop, uh
I rise like a helicopter
Like Zulu I'll Shaka, crowd
With a beat that's loud
Huh, I'm black and I'm proud, irrelevant
I'm black and intelligent
I teach my kids to watch the education they give 'em
'Cause it's really all about street wisdom

True hip-hoppers don't bleed
True hip-hoppers don't need
True hip-hoppers don't speed
No time for greed
True hip-hoppers do read and will lead
Not plead
Will sow seeds that breed
Ah-ha that's safer than weed, indeed
True hip-hoppers don't slave
True hip-hoppers don't crave
Silver and gold, we're not amazed
We live F-R-E-E
If you not into lyrics you can't really hear it nor see me
My philosophy keeps it plain and simple
Here it is: the kingdom of hip-hop is within you
Or is it the kingdom of hell that sends you?
I'm ringin a bell within you
You only seekin to sell
That's what sin do
It tells you to put your craft on a menu, a chart
So they can sell you and your art",https://genius.com/Krs-one-get-your-self-up-lyrics

Good looking, word...
DJ Revolution, word up...
Let's do this, kid...
Here we go!

A good time, a good vibe, and a house with a court
Good life, good wife, a little food for thought
I need (I need) food, clothes, and a whip with rims
I need God in my life, I need family and friends
(I need) money, power, respect, I need love
I need world peace, homeless to eat, no drugs
I need every race and creed to be one
Every nation, every face and seed to see sun

You need to listen to this, you need to listen to Kris
You need to have peace at least, you need spiritual bliss
You need a lyrical twist, do you know what a miracle is?
Before we begin, you may need a kiss
I suggest either one from J to O-one from the lips
Either way what I'm saying, yo, is bound to uplift
You need checks, you need cash, you need intellect
You need to be moving fast, you need that big respect
You need to be rolling in a car, going to a bar that's far
Makin' the deal to make you a star
You need to ask yourself, now do you know who you are?
Where you goin'? How many steps you took so far?
You need patience, you need to control your mind
If you read and don't act, then you're wasting your time
We need better leaders, we need better preachers
We need a three-thousand dollar raise to all teachers


You need some meditation, you need rejuvenation
You need assistance right now with your situation
You need some contemplation, you need a combination
–A combination of will power and concentration
You need some syncopation, with regular relaxation
But you can't, cause you runnin' and racin' and chasin'
You need to slow down, maybe you should speed up
One sayin' ""lay down,"" the other's sayin' ""leap up""
You gotta keep up, I suggest you start to speak up
A lawyer, a doctor, a rapper — you wanna be what?
Whatever it is, you gotta visualize
You need to focus for real, and stop livin' them lies
The time you givin' them guys
You could be workin' upon the goal you hold
Yo, you must realize, yo, you need to be wise
Yo, you need to be alive, there could be no revenge or deceit in your eyes
Rise!


Gimme what I need, do it with speed
Change the situation around, plant new seeds
I roll with a righteous team of adults
Forget the insults, we plan to get results
You can call us a cult, you can call us a gang
But when it comes to Hiphop, no, you cats can't hang
When the Gatts go bang
And the telephone rang
Telling you to come to identify the remains
That's when you feel the pain
And my name comes as comfort, ease and all stress and strain
You need to know the game
You need to know the meaning of your own name
Reprogram your own brain, ask questions with no shame
How you think you gonna master your craft if you don't train?
Perfecting your skill, that's the aim
Perfect your skill, and you'll always have money and fame
C'mon!

What I, uhh, what I need
(House on the hill)
That's what I need
(Cash credit on my bill)
That's what I need
(All my dreams fulfilled)
That's what I need
(New whip that I can wheel)
What I need
(With the chromed out grill)
Uh huh, that's what I need
(And the girl that can chill)
That's what I need
(And my spirit all healed)

Live at the club I spit 'em all
Rappers backstage lookin sad and piti-fal
Cause they know I'm the pinna-cle and they mini-mal
I spit the metaphysical, the spiritual
The oracle, the lyrical, the oratorical
Rookie!  I'll mop the floor witcho'
I'm the lyrical foundation to all your flows
All your clothes, all your shows and I'm not alone
You wouldn't even know how to hold the mic or the phone
You couldn't even bite on the bone
While we was rockin mics out in Rome
Now you hyped cause you grown?
You know we internationally known, the people love it
But what they learnin bout is on the whole, look above it

I think I'm gonna take the spiritual route
Then I woke up....

Then I realized I'm out of my purpose
Out of my purp', not doin my work
I went on a search, inside of myself
For true health, love awareness and wealth
I went to the Temple and opened my mental
I learned that I'm the cause of all that I been through
Your whole environment is really within you
Reach inside your heart and write a new menu
I'mma be the change that I want to see
Now I can see, that I'm really free
Everything is really always somethin else
Tell yourself a different story 'bout self
Do you have the courage to be you
All that talk, that you talk, is it really you?
Oh silly you, oh silly me
Your tongue is killin YOU, not killin me
I'm feelin free, to be, just what I wanna be
Easily, you see, cause I woke up...

When I woke up, my debt went down
My locks broke up, my rent went down
My stocks went up, my car sped up
My pockets swell up, my life I found
I'm not so fed up it's time to get up
A clear mind switched my life around
Now I can see where the help is at
The health love awareness and wealth is at
Cause I woke up...
Cause I woke up! I woke up!
When I woke up, I woke up
That's when I woke up

How Bad Do You Want It,Bootleg Volume C (Mixtape) ,UnKnown,"Yo, my man, how bad do you want it?
You know how many cats I threw the pitch, and they never caught it?
I told them to bring they lyric, but they never brought it
Scared to get ripped off, cheated, deleted, rejected and shorted?
Yo, how bad do you want it?
FearóI ain't got no time for it
If you want it, yo there's the trackóput your rhyme on it!

This hunger inside of me's unexplainable, Kris
The struggle we put in this box will be put into disc
Birth and ever, these family problems is hurtin'
Both of my sisters is pregnant, fuckin' feel like murkin'
All I have is my word and my balls
And my fam and my music speaks for them all
It's the Dominican animal ready to damage, you puttin'
Pressure to rappers that think they can challenge you, Kris (uh huh)
We been through it all, the grimiest days, this earth ain't
Ready for my brain, comin' to face (word)
Everyone plus everyone
Do you hear me, KRS-One?

Well listen
You grimy and hungry?
But how long you gonn' trust me?
You really down for this cause or just chasin' the money?
I be up in them spots to be hot, so dusty and ugly
Nothin' be funny, it's all dark, nothin' sunny
Can you walk with me? Talk with me? Pop the cork with me?
When we in other cities, will you rep New York with me? (yeah!)
I need respect and honor
Discipline and no drama
How bad you want it, poppa? (with all my…)

Loyalty is the key to it all (remember)
Get used to my face, we the winners of all
By mi gente, yo I go low to say-ah
Real like them Washington Heights
Niggas there (say yeah!)

After you rap, will you stab my back? (never)
You gimme a track, will you take that back? (never)
I give the word, yo you bustin' your Gatt? (whatever)
Respect from your crew? They livin' like that? (they better)
This is no game! Why should I make you popular?
You know I'm the philosopha
How bad do you want it?
How bad do you need it?
If you see it, you can believe it, perceive it, retrieve it and flaunt it
How bad do you want, doggone it, there's the track, if you want it
You got to put your rhyme on it!

How bad do I want it? I'm ready to die like Big
A serious man with blood in my eyes for this
Success doesn't come overnight
It's gonna be dark a while until I see light (that's right!)
What is it?

This is no game, why should I do it?
KRS-One, me and Peedo runnin' through it
I saw you down the street in FedEx
You said you had the beats was comin', like ""I Got Next""
So we went upstairs, my man Choco hooked it up
This is KRS-Oneóturn my voice up! Whaó (wha-,wha-)
How bad do you want it?
How bad do you see it?
How bad do you hear it?
How bad do you BELIEVE you can be it?
If you doubt, then you're out
If you believe, you can achieve
I got the city on lock, but I'm gonna hand you the Keys like Alicia
You know my style, you know I'm the teacha
Philosopha, minister, emcee, Hiphop's spiritual leader
With the heater
You comin' with me? You runnin' with me?
In the spirit Scott LaRock, JMJ and Pun is with me
Yo, cats be steppin' to me ALL the time
With the rawest rhyme
But two weeks later, they fall to crime
If you listenin' to this song, and you want to be put on
You must be loyal to the cats that made you strong
It could be your friend, your father, you sister, your mother, your brother
Or some other
Just remember the days when YOU was under!
Before the Hummer, before the Benz
Before the hundreds, before the fifties, the twenties and tens
When you was thirsty, remember the living water, and who poured it
Now ask yourself, how bad do you want it?",https://genius.com/Krs-one-how-bad-do-you-want-it-lyrics
Ain’t The Same,Kristyles,2003.0,"You know it's Kris!

It ain't the same now (it ain't the same)
They switched the game now (they switched up on us)
They talk 'bout chains now (bling bling)
Rims on the Range now
It's sounding plain now
Y'all rock the same style (sound of the mic)
I know the way how (I know)
Bring it back to one, it's supposed to be

This is the way it's supposed to be
It's supposed to be like you more close to me
It's supposed to be about our families
It's supposed to be about avoiding catastrophe
But it's all about salary and flattery
Distrust, lust, hate and tragedy
It's supposed to be about you and me on the same route
Were you there in eighty-six when I first came out?
And you know about how they running this game out
It's supposed to be about fun and getting' the pain out
But it's all about clout and popping them chains out
Instead of forgiveness, we popping they brains out
It's supposed to be about seeking in the seek out
You witnessing injustice, you got to speak out
If you claiming you love this, you got to release doubt
Knowledge is what I'm all about

It ain't the same now (it ain't the same)
They switched the game now (they switched up on us)
They talk 'bout chains now (bling bling)
Rims on the Range now
It's sounding plain now
Y'all rock the same style (sound of the mic)
I know the way how (I know)
Bring it back to one, it's supposed to be

Well it's supposed to be sunlight over me
Light over you, not you running over me
It's supposed to be a two dollar royalty minimum
A hip-hop guild we got to begin building 'em
It's supposed to be no police brutality
And the fact that we tolerate that crap is insanity
It's supposed to be museums and archives
Where people can see the importance of our lives
But it ain't about any of this
Cats are trying to get that diamond-studded Rolex on they wrist
You hear a voice in the wilderness you know it's Kris
Higher consciousness lyrics, they will persist
But it's supposed to be about making it better
You see, hip-hop's not a product like pants or sweater
Go ahead, be a hero, get your cheddar
Even y'all gonna see when you look back you remember that

It ain't the same now (it ain't the same)
They switched the game now (they switched up on us)
They talk 'bout chains now (bling bling)
Rims on the Range now
It's sounding plain now
Y'all rock the same style (sound of the mic)
I know the way how (I know)
Bring it back to one, it's supposed to be

You can see in your heart how it's supposed to be
You doing your part, that's how it's supposed to be
Pursuing your art, that's how it's supposed to be
Today you will start, that's how it's supposed to be
It shouldn't be about you moving slowly
Then talking junk when you don't even know me
And you cats be pussy like Josie
I Touch ""50 MC's"" like Tony
Everybody in the hood ain't your homie
I spit the truth, but I'm not the only
There's plenty, K-R-S-O-N-E

Take Your Tyme,Spiritual Minded,UnKnown,"Y'all don't know?  Y'all don't know your body is a temple?
A temple to the living God?  Don't get gassed y'all
All my sisters out there, here's the truth
You, a you've got to.. {TAKE.. YOUR.. TIME}
Look, look!
You don't want no unsteady relationships, you want it tight
You don't want no man beggin and always gonna get, am I right?
You don't want no man sleepin cheatin freakin behind his wife
There's no such thing as make love, it's really make life
I don't care what nobody say; you sleep with a man, that's your husband
So make sure, before you lay down, you love him
And learn him, yes it's still sacred to be a virgin
Relax, it's curiosity that always burns 'em in fact
Sex is like candy, be disciplined, no splurgin
You don't want your stomach hurtin
Girl, you gotta.. {TAKE.. YOUR.. TIME}
Listen!
Cash is an issue with that he can never diss you
Even if he makes you cry, you bought your own tissue
Witcha own case, witcha own hand, wipe ya own face
And throw him out, no doubt, out of your own place
If your heart is broken you can mend it
If you're independent, your womanhood, that's when you defend it
Just.. uhh, just {TAKE.. YOUR.. TIME} woo!
Look!
{TAKE.. YOUR.. TIME}
Don't come witcha hand always out
If he buys you somethin thank him, but that's not what a man is about
Real men are real friends, showin their real commitment
He tells you he really loves you, a boy can't really admit it
If a man really wants you, that man really flaunts you
In public or private a real man really supports you
'Member what Guru taught you?  Of course you ""Royalty""
You dress how you like when a QUEEN is what you ought to be
And ought to act like, and also ought to manifest
How you dress makes you constantly blessed, or constantly stressed
{TAKE.. YOUR.. TIME} Yo!
{TAKE.. YOUR.. TIME}
Yo, yo
So while you burnin off those calories, think about reality
Get a skill for the salary, a man for the family
Not a boy, that's a catastrophe, don't get mad at me
Instead of always clubbin visit museums and art galleries
Pick the single man, admirin the ancient sculpture
He's cultured, chances are he won't insult ya
Give him your number only after you know what he does
Ask him what it is, not what it was
You want the good life (GOOD LIFE)
You want the good life (GOOD LIFE)
You want the, you want the, you want the
C'mon, you gotta {TAKE.. YOUR.. TIME}",https://genius.com/Krs-one-take-your-tyme-lyrics
Come to Da Party,I Got Next,1997.0," One, two, three..

Come to da party, come to the dance
Everyone is fightin
So they fired up, up and away
Come to da party, come to the dance
To pull out the vinyl
So they fired up, up and away

Yeah, yeah
Hardcore lyric comin at ya they attackin ya
Rappers bite like Dracula the soul of hip-hop
I'm puttin back in ya, with the South Bronx vernacular
Bound to put the crack in your armor, I am much sharper
Than a lot of other mic rockers, slightly eccentric
But everything's authentic, when I said, ""I'm hip-hop,"" I meant it
Emcees wanna debate the issue, but false though
If they studied they would see that they are hip-hop also
Hip-Hop you can't do it, you gots to be it
You can't confine it, you have to free it, so you can see it
As your expression, and learn the lesson, on life in ghetto sections
And what you feel is the forward direction
For black people, not these Star Wars save that for R2-D2
I got five fingers like Bruce Lee do
And with the five fingers I grab microphones and bring the
Stinger to DJ's, rappers, singers and beer drinkers
This MC's a thinker, unlike others but I won't diss yaz
You're still my brothers and sisters, Kris is
ONE aspect of hip-hop rap
Negative rap, positive rap, forget that black it's a trap
To set us back, concentrate on various rap talents
Presently the rap radio format is unbalanced
You either got the player, or the concious rhyme sayer
All day, on your radio, not with a different flavor
Someone has to DIE before you hear a concious record
People don't like gangsta rap, but concious rap, they don't respect it
The truth is people are afraid of black youth
Our expressions, our lessons and gold teeth, so..

Come to da party, come to the dance
Everyone is shoutin
So they fired up, up and away
Come to da party, come to the dance
Everyone is singin
So they fired up, up and away",https://genius.com/Krs-one-come-to-da-party-lyrics
We Don’t Care Anymore,D.I.G.I.T.A.L.,1993,"We don't care anymore (care anymore)
We don't share anymore (share anymore)

I'll keep on bringin and singin until your ears is ringin
And stingin flingin and gleamin true MC'n with meanin
It's seemin we fiendin for all the cream and all the screamin
The demon got us believin in schemin, rhymin for no reason
Every weekend we weakened, discipline is what we needin
But we too busy freakin to understand divine speakin
Is anyone out there tryin to make it better?
Or is all of hip-hop about the cheddar? Whatever!

You don't care anymore (care anymore)
We don't share anymore (share anymore)

We don't share and care no more, we think this one's about lust
In every debate we create more hate and mistrust in us
Judge not least ye may be judged, show understandin
You don't know anyone's plan in life, it's so demandin
This one rippin off that one, that one rippin off this one
Listen, givin is livin and livin is givin, you listenin?
Our culture we pissin in, pissin on
Rappin for platinum plaques but when live, can't get it on


What a response, from the Bronx, to wreck shit, when it's hectic
Players wanna be stars, instead of being respected
That's somethin that I won't do of course, I break 'em off
Straight from the source, they think they boss, when they lost
Tryin to force it, when it don't fit, I'll bust you down and I won't quit
Mics and money you won't get, when dogs don't do that dope shit
Now turn it around and peep it, make sure to keep it a secret
I come down with that deep shit, straight out the sky I speak it


Somehowwwwww, we got lost
And now our sharing, is gone
No one cares, no one shares
We gotta make it right, so we all can unite",https://genius.com/Krs-one-we-dont-care-anymore-lyrics
I Am There,Life,UnKnown,"{*knocking*}

Come in {*door opens*} sit down
Yeah...
I have a magical mind, a magical body
Ancient metaphysician, you better AX somebody
With one handshake, I can tell if your plan's fake
I am to hip-hop, what flour is to pancakes
I write rhymes 'til my hand aches
In the mountains of Colorado, takin in the landscape
When I'm in the city I can't wait to live again
In the underground hot springs of the Hopi Indians
So you look around your heart and your mind
You will find, I am there
If you're cold and you're broke and there's fog in your scope
Have hope, I am there
Get in tune with me, move with me, boom with me, room with me
Zoom with me, I am there
I can see where you're at, feelin trapped, can't move can't act
I was there
And it's quite clear
My hardware was set ahead of most folks by ten years
The hand of God set it, so on Earth I speak prophetic
Publishin papers with no edit
I speak but most don't get it, but the few that do get it
In their minds my words stay embedded
And they blessed if they don't forget it
They'll never need a psychiatrist, a psychic or a medic
Where we headed? To the ultimate state of freedom
That's where I'll lead 'em, if you let it I'll free 'em
Let's set it, for human beings in recreation
Havin fun recreatin themselves into a nation
Hip-Hop! It's home could never be a station
Sharin a space with R&B, stop fakin
Do you know how much money they makin offa you and I
Just because hip-hop won't unify?
So look inside your heart or your mind you will find
Everytime, I am there
If you're cold and you're broke and there's fog in your scope
Have hope! I am there
Get in tune with me, move with me, boom with me, room with me
Zoom with me, I am there
I can see where you're at, feelin trapped, can't move can't act

(Money!)
Money - M-o-n-e-y
(Money!)

M-o-n-e-y, what you need to just get by
Money, honey, ain't it funny?
Money, people wanna die
It seems without money, people cry, people will lie
You cannot deny, without money you can't apply
For anything that catches your eye, I wonder why
The root of all evil, let me teach you, now who am I?
The MC, teachin' my people ""Don't live that lie""
You got to get money, but don't let money get you, guy
I can break it down like whatever you want
Whatever you spend your money on strong, yo that's what you flaunt
Spend your money on these honeys, yo if that's what you want
Spend your money on attorneys if you're goin' to court
If I look around your neck I can see what you bought
What, you think you get respect? No, you takin' a short
Yo, you need the money, of course, you need it to live
(Yo, what you put your money on, Kris?) Yo, right on my kids

M-o-n-e-y, don't ask why. It IS the root of all evil
Though very necessary to your livelihood
It's all good when you got enough
Til enough ain't enough and you hit upon rough times
You make your money and I'll make mine
(Yo, we need the...) (Money!)

Don't get me wrong, mistakin' this song
Like money is not important - yes, it is, just be strong
It's the reason for the thievin' and that war goin'on
It's the reason that you seein' all these girls in their thong
It's the reason that the radio's on
It's the reason that you believe if you gotta work from sun-up 'til dawn
It's the cravings that connect you to that money you makin'
Your desire is the fire got you feelin' you slavin'
(Free yourself!) Money doesn't make you the man
(Be yourself!) A man gets his money in credit(?)
Ok, I'ma get this money, really, all day
But not to the point where Im goin' the wrong way
I'ma put my money down on rides and all that
Hook up the house so me and my spouse can fall back
Investing my knowledge way beyond college
Write books and fly hooks in my cottage
Cheese - Kris bling-blingin'? Yo, please!
Money is an energy that gets what I need
I can understand them cats that rap flossin' and frontin'
It's all good, they from the hood, never had nothin'
They just got they money and everything's sunny
Hear what I'm saying, they preyin', boy, and lookin for bunnies

Did we floss what we bought
Forgetting that sharing is what we've been taught?
Cause this here gettin' money is an individual sport
Money can get me in to the same place where years ago
My bros and sisters with black skin
Were confined to the back door and the kitchen

Last verse, where your cash purse
Reach into your wallet, nothin' alloted, that hurts
Breath stinkin' you're thinkin', but can't afford Certs
Need the dollar and baby hollerin' - no work
I don't know how you gonna get the dough
You could become educated, you could become a ho
You could do both, that's like puttin' butter on toast
The bread is the knowledge, butter is what gets you that close

Money is funny - how a piece of paper can make or break your very existence
Quick as it come, quick as it go - you better know about the ebb and the flow
You get money in droves, trick it on cars and blow
Throw dollars at black queens cause, for the dough they'll strip their clothes
And for the right amount of money
A king will pimp his queen into being a ho on a stroll
Life will always be hard when you choose to make money your god",https://genius.com/Krs-one-money-lyrics

Bling blung rock the bells

Move along, move along, along, this is a newa song
KRS-One the supa strong
Move along before you lose your tongue
Before you lose ya lung
Be sure MCs get done
Detour or move along
We teach the young
How many young men hung so we could sing a song?
You need to move along, along, along
The string of injustice stung those that bling cause now they blung
Materialism stings and now they stung
You need to move along
Life is like ding, dong, ying, yang, bing, bang, ping, pong, or ping, pong
Any lyrical battle we won
Yes, this a master flow, this how life go on
First you got it then your gone
So don't get stung
Cause after the bling it's blung
No material thing stays with you long


Move along, along, we can't get stung
We the one, 
my melanin stuns right up in the sun
I go and I come, don't mind me son
I'm just a teacher, them cats should't try me son
I'm that lively one
I roll with them grimey ones
At the Temple (of Hip Hop) you can find me son
What I bring and sing reflects what I brung
I be rolling, aling off the tongue
You can check them other ones
Maybe them younger ones
But I be that I witness just like Connie Chung
Some burn the paper
Some burn the bong
I'm burning rappers, I think you need to move along!


Move along you little singers
Never linger round a rhyme bringer
These rap blingers
I break you off a middle finger
Bell ringa, in your mind a dong dinga
Yo, that's what's wrong with these singas
When they sing all they bring is bling
THEY DUMMIES
But after the bling aling, aling is blung
Post bling is blung
A new ting son
I'm rockin these bells like ding dong
As you can see I got no rings on
Cause it got nothing to with what springs song
So ding dong
Open the door to freedom
Any of my books you should read dum and be strong
Or else you need to move along, along, along
Your lyrics are cow dung
There use to be a TV talent show with a gong
And when the gong gonged you were gone
Yes I am the lyrical Don
Beats for art um
But I am unattched to all of thum
The message of the song is bling blung
Don't get caught up in watcha bought up

That they can meet me on the court and it’ll be uh-uh onnnn

Now Blitz ice grillin, like put em up
It ain’t take long for Kobe to shut em up

Alright Blitz, the game is to 10
LeBron, check it out and show em how we get it in

Now he all nervous, tension brewing
Vixen was trying to talk some sense into em

Look at this reindeer, he can barely dribble

C’mon Bron, show some respect
He got hooves, not hands, what the heck you expect

So through his greed he makes a faster plan
He has drugs to make the cow grow quicker
Through the stress the cow gets sicker
Twenty one different drugs are pumped
Into the cow in one big lump
So just before it dies, it cries
In the slaughterhouse full of germs and flies
Off with the head, they pack it, drain it, and cart it
And there it is, in your local supermarket
Red and bloody, a corpse, neatly packed
And you wonder about heart attacks?
Come on now man let's be for real
You are what you eat is the way I feel
But, the Food and Drug Administration
Will tell you meat is the perfect combination
See cows live under fear and stress
Trying to think what's gonna happen next
Fear and stress can become a part of you
In your cells and blood, this is true
So when the cow is killed, believe it
You preserve those cells, you freeze it
Thaw it out with the blood and season it
Then you sit down and begin eatin it
In your body, it's structure becomes your structure
All the fear and stress of another
Any drug is addictive by any name
Even drugs in meat, they are the same
The FDA has America strung out
On drugs in beef no doubt
So if you think that what I say is a bunch of crock
Tell yourself you're gonna try and stop
Eatin meat and you'll see you can't compete
It's the number one drug on the street
Not crack, cause that was made for just blacks
But brown beef, for all American teeth
Life brings life and death brings death
Keep on eatin the dead and what's left
Absolute disease and negative
Read the book 'How to Eat to Live'
By Elijah Muhammad, it's a brown paperback
For anybody, either white or black
See how many cows must be pumped up fatter
How many rats gotta fall in the batter
How many chickens that eat shit you eat
How much high blood pressure you get from pig feet
See you'll consume, the FDA could care less 
They'll sell you donkey meat and say it's

Who da Best,Back to the L.A.B. (Lyrical Ass Beating),UnKnown,"Time to clear out the bullshit!
We ain't gon' never give up this type of sound
Time to clear out the bullshit!
I know what y'all, what y'all after
We ain't never leaving this space right here!
This is what it is
When we took the vow ""I am Hip Hop""
This is what we swore to defend, this
Welcome to the Lyrical Ass Beating
I'm not in a mansion or a yacht
I'm right on your black man speaking, I keep teaching
Cats be like ""How he still eating?""
Cause I build on skills that never weaken
I ripped a club just last weekend
Y'all sitting around playing XBox and internet freaking
Then you want to get what I got? You want to get in my spot?
You want to click, click and hold on my Glock?
Nah player get your own pistol
My arms become dealers when I'm holding up that mic missile
Stay back with your rap, it might clip you
I use smart mics, my words will hit you
As you can see I'm much realer
When the mic weapon is in my arm, I become that rap arms dealer
So who da best? Who da best out here?
Who claiming the crown when KRS out here
Who da best motherfucker today? My fans are here to stay
Sixteen albums,
 
not one of my producers were fake
Who da freshest motherfucker in rap?
You better dig in your crates, who lives what they state?
Who's the most consistent to date?
If you're talking 2Pac or B.I.G. you late (KRS!!)
I ain't got a Maybach but I takes it way back
Knowledge reigns supreme, watch how you say that
I slept where the World Trade at
Right at ground zero's where my head laid at
New York is where I'm raised at
When it comes to Hip-Hop, we made that
We can never trade that,
 for any payback
Yo, JS! Where the real DJs at?",https://genius.com/Krs-one-who-da-best-lyrics
Still Spittin’,Keep Right,2004,"It don't stop, word
It don't stop, we still spittin! Word
Knowledge Reigns Supreme, Over Nearly Everyone
When you gon' get it? Aww man

Watch how I spit 'em, watch how I hit 'em
Inebriated rhythm, we get up all in 'em
KRS you gotta get him, we the best we always win 'em
Them cats won't admit I'm in the club rippin they shit
I'm raw when I'm on tour you better be sure when you get 'em
'Til you hit the floor and spin 'em, them elements do you live 'em?
Or are you just usin 'em, confusin 'em and killin them
Your touring is boring, your minimum ain't fulfillin them
So let's start drillin 'em, why we ain't feelin them
Cause we lookin and lookin and don't see that real in them
Cars we be wheelin them, minds we be healin them
With books and CD's, believe me we straight dealin them
Live in the club them thugs hit the ceiling
When they get the feeling KRS-One start delivering
So who's up? (Akbar) You live hip-hop?
Yo, get on the mic and show 'em what you got

This whole rap game is a gamble, some MC's can't handle
Financial freeze, your record company's at a standstill
While I breeze through a sample, and lead by example
Find fertile minds and drop seeds by the handful
Man you ain't gotta hit me in my head with the anvil
I grow wise, I recognize the lies and the scandal
Once you sign on that line, your career could depend on
These white collar crooks who cook the books like Enron
So I took an oath to speak no lie
While mad rappers die over beef like E. Coli
I guess you thugs won't get the picture until them slugs hit ya
I ain't a hater, but sooner or later ""Love's Gonna Get 'Cha""
And if you don't know that, then you dumb fella
And everything I said, went right over your head, like an umbrella
So who's up? (L) You live hip-hop? (Damn right)
Yo, get on the mic and show 'em what you got

Categorize me with the best clique, rhyme majestic
With it I get sick and mo' connected
So electric my energy is remembered I'm limitless
My mind screamin just against the rhythm, intense is the ism
In 'em I long salute the young and hungry to shine
Nightmares of lost time haunt taunt me to rhyme
Been isolated, waitin years to finally reappear
Cheers I made it, all praise due, Inebriated
These words are weaponry, huh, mental telepathy
Rocks for definite, reppin it, 'til the death of me
Pain left in me runs deep, and leaks through the speakers
In Jeeps and tape decks, then connects to your peeps
We keep it, thorough borough to borough, city to ghetto
Rock like, heavy mental on the, instrumental
So who's up? (Illin') You live hip-hop?
Get on the mic and give it what you got

I got five on it, you want it, flaunt it without hesi-
Dues paid check the rezzy, the black film be
That of a blunt's ashpassed via the spectacular cast
To get at the mass and choose sets, listen
I rep even when I be fingerin 'em, get it, probably not
Probably thought I meant that snitch talk
Starvin your brain, I never come with the simple and plain
To get at these thoughts, get on the train of
Come mek mi learn ya bwoy, you nah fi toy wit de sum'n
Microphone check one, no frontin
You niggas is mimin your rhymes cause y'all ain't sayin nuttin
So mi dust off mi foot bottom pon unuh mat
Cause fi mi good will stay huntin'
Fi a new day, mon, unuh fi wake up
Industry fi get shake up
Married to the ghetto you niggas fi get break up
Ahh so who live hip-hop
Upon de hip, me ride the Soul Train ock

Yo I'm not to be confused with these popular new names
I been paid my dues I'm at the top of the food chain
And I should get an award for slept on peeps
So this beat'll be perfect for my acceptance speech
Forever loved in your city, thanks to rap
My album's a continuous seller like fitted Yankee caps
I'm like a demon, crossbred with a ragin bull
I'm from the South but I relate more to ""Paid in Full""
So focused on my grind, I'm potent when I rhyme
Tell niggas close your fuckin mouth and open up your mind
It takes more than a few weeks to learn
I make sure rappers and microphones ain't on speakin terms
As far as you concerned, I'm losin my temper and patience
Nobody takes shit serious like an impotent rapist
So who's up? (An Ion) You live hip-hop? (True dat, true dat)
Yo, get on the mic and show 'em what you got

I'm aggressive, progressive, words young ticker be vital
Rip the game and the name to reclaim any taken title
Directly hand out stares to the needle as it rotates
An agent to decrepit from rigormortis in flow eighths
Not even for a minute can you rap
Let down by the sound that drowns the clowns even dare to step
Don't ride the rhythm, I order you to jock
Your claim to fame was holdin down but you can't hold cock
Damn right we can fight, I stay with grudge
With no prior budge from the previous
And when is it that fourth'll crack cranium, kids come in the picture
Knowin that asshole and Ion and you ain't the perfect mixture
Like Alice, diners become the impeccable haven
That any enter my zone must be stripped down and shaven
I stand before you as a fiendish critter
Creatin causin collision with a pen
Written that hatred of spaced-out squashed men like it was a sin
The only job payin me enough to snuff the rough

Skinny cat, young cat, with a knapsack strapped to my back
1981 before the crack attack
I used to let the Olde English 800 suds bubble
In the last car of the Franklin Avenue shuttle
Brooklyn, no doubt, Wingate Park, no doubt
Prospect Park I'm all laid out
Homeless, my gear played out and I know this
But I'm an MC I stay focused
I took the shuttle to the D and wrote my rhymes in a hour
Took the D to the E, last stop the Twin Towers
Sittin in the belly of the beast
In the World Trade organization, bein harassed by the police
I wrote my rhymes right there on the spot
New York City, 1984 corruption was hot
Cats sellin uzis out the Jacob Javits Center for a high price
Let me tell you 'bout my life

Eighty-five comes in, eighty-six comes in
The marijuana with the cocaine mix comes in
High class hustlers, I'm takin flicks with them
My first songs Red Alert, he's mixin them
This a far cry from a kid sleepin on the bench
Now I'm V.I.P. in the club, this don't make sense
But it does, as I take daps and hugs
From cats that move drugs, they say ""Kris rise above""
Everybody knew my style, Kris was no coward
I wanted to get in the game but my peeps wouldn't allow it
They'd say, ""Read them books and write them hooks
Save our children, give 'em a whole new outlook""
So I did, I lived like any street kid
But I was handed 20 books, others were handed 20 year bids
Still they wouldn't sell to your mother or your wife
There was respect man~! Let me tell you 'bout my life


1987 my career blowin up now
Me and Scott LaRock took the year growin up now
Me I'm just a private cat, whatever you perceive as live
KRS is as live as that
We the livest act, in eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-now
But them years be far behind me now
In ninety-one, no one can find me now
I chose the underground to rhyme where it's grimy, WOW
Rewind me now, 13 albums for you to see
Or catch me speakin at them universities
My mind stays keen, I'm hardly ever seen
I do a lot of work, just not in the mainstream

Philosophical,Kristyles,2003,"Yo turn me up just a bit, so I can hear it and spit
Reverse spit, and get tips, rehearse a hit and take tricks
Research the art just a bit, don't let me start I won't quit
But if I start I'mma flip, just like I'm startin the whip
Puttin the key into it, mentally seein it
G.O.D. believin in it, I get a fee when I spit
C-L-U-B's I just rip, I'm lyrically well equipped
Over the beats and the mix, I keep the streets in a fit
When it comes to lyrical spit, I'm the t'cha of it
Higher consciousness, truth, I'll be reachin for it
Metaphysics, here's an example cause I'm speakin of it
Put your hands in the air, but you must be aware
That even if your hands are down, ain't they still in the air?
I be takin you all the way down the road, takin you there
I'm livin and givin just a smidgen of what I share
The style that I'm kickin, lyric lickings from over there
We rockin forever, we get better with every year
With letters and intercessors I sever every fear
Lookin here, like UPS KRS takes it there
Let's make it clear, thought waves go through the air
You can act like you busy or you dizzy or you don't care
But listen here, everybody got a fear
An insecurity, some type of thing they gotta clear
So that's when I, reappear, from the rear
Philsopher, follow the bright light to right here
I might wear, light gear
Appear when you least expect it, tellin you now how to fight fear
With faith, you hear the bass, well clear the waste
You gotta get the negative cats out your face
Get that irrelevant crap out your space
Conceive it believe it decree it achieve it with HASTE!

Nuttin in the world is impossible
Listen to the shit that I drop on you
KRS-One, philosophical
Believe and achieve what you got to do

We rawwwwwwwwwk, we don't stop
Hip-Hooooooooop, we don't stop
Tick-tooooooock, we don't stop
We at the top we never drop cause true hip-hop is so hot
Some people thuggin, some be pimpin, I be teachin a lot
I be teachin about the meaning of a deeper hip-hop
That don't make me any better than a thief or a cop
All I know is when I flow, the people be shocked
You don't really want the teacher to come step on your block
With my whole Glock takin everything that you've got
I'm a different type of deeper intellectual rock
For when you really wanna compete and get up off your block
You are not just doin hip-hop, you ARE hip-hop
Like if you have a badge and a gun, you ARE the cop
Like if you practice medicine, you ARE the doc
You just forgot rappers rap about cars a lot
And the magazines worry about stars a lot
But I'm the sun and they avoid me BECAUSE I'm hot
The orthodox hip-hop is sure to rock
With or without a video, I'm leavin 'em all in shock, OHH!

R.I.P.
, this one for you, my G
Let's get it

Boogie Down Productions, with Premier, we gettin paid
Y'all write the wackest songs, our shit be better
Remember, you act up, you will not win
Cause then I'll begin to smash you
With rhymin', rhymin', rhymin'

Criminal minded, this the jumpoff
My first one blast like you poppin that pumpoff
Yo Premier, why these rappers so soft?
They corny ass raps be makin me doze off
You know I get the whole house open
Got the whole East, West, North, South open
I ain't jokin', you know how many times
I spit rhymes and left rappers wit they mouth open?
Y'all need to fall back
The hip-hop you got in you now, I installed that
I spit a raw rap, peace and war rap
Ten more raps, where the tours at?
Cause the world is so hood, you must always be ready
...TO LET IT BLOOOOOOOW!!! (BUCK! BUCK! BUCK! BUCK! BUCK!)
I'd rather talk about peeeeeeeace, but these rappers won't let me
SO HERE WE GOOOOOOOO!!!
I'd rather mind my business, but these rappers think
They Superbad, that's when they get smothered, chocked, and gagged
I just bought another Jag
Cause when I spit lyrics, I step-father like your other dad
(""One-two, one-two"") I stay true
I'm a Gang Starr and I'm Guru
Hah! I train like CHOO-CHOO!
Y'all rappers rap crap, BULLSHIT DOO-DOO!!
Who knew?! I don't compare to you
Look at my nose, I even take in more air than you
I'm more aware than you and I spit it
I built this hip-hop matrix then programmed you IN IT!
I would tell you what's gon' happen this summer
But I'mma general, I don't talk to runners
Y'all just rappin and rappin shitty
So when you talk about battle, I get giddy

And Premier is on the breaks""

By the ice and the way rappers shinin
K-R-S, that's how I sign it
God knows I try to live non-violent!
But rappers be too defiant, no doubt
They make me wanna try this new Magnum out
They be draggin 'em out
Cause of death: Magnum goin off in the mouth
What y'all talkin 'bout?! You better +Walk it Out+
Y'all start mumblin when that Hawk is out
New York ain't out! WHAT CHA'LL TALKIN 'BOUT?!
Y'all POP like when the cork is out!
Stoppin the violence is what I'm all about
STOPPIN THE VIOLENCE IS WHAT I'm ALL ABOUT!
But you raise ya fist to Kris, Ill maim ya wrist
And blow you out like a birthday wish!
I'm much sharper
Including New York State, the whole East Coast is Kris Parker's
But real talk, Digny
The true kings of New York left when it change hands to Disney
I got no time for the kid rap
The gun talk, drug talk, we already did that
These days I'm tryin to give back
Knowledge, wisdom, overstanding - now spit that!

Now there's ranks supreme KRS is a free man
In Hip-Hop culture, I'm like Allen Greenspan

This a movement, all over the world we reach
I can prove it, all over the world I teach
You hear that Dr.King, ""I Have A Dream"" speech a lot
But no where is it manifested but in Hip-Hop
While them other cats be lookin' for a radio song
I'm in Washington Heights, puttin' them Dominicans on
You can feel it I'm strong, I last longer lets do it

I teach y'all thugs, cause that's what I was
Yeah I say was cause today I'm above
All the guns, illegal funds, the crews and the drugs
ANY HOOD I walk in, they show me love
They say 'Knowledge Reigns Supreme, WHATTUP CUZ?'
Cops wanna get sit down and get all bud
They wanna think as they drink drink down to the suds
I respect it, but I don't get down with the fuzz
I don't drink with DT's I don't hang with the judge
But truth be truth and I got the proof
Most ministers were straight thugged out in they youth
See if you're over 25 and you never got live
When it was time to ride, you ain't got no heart
But if you're over 26 and you're still in the mix
And your life you ain't fixed, you ain't doin your part
You see them cats on TV, playin the role?
Gassin y'all, them cats be over thirty years old!
Actin all dirty and cold
NONE OF MY CLASSIC ALBUMS they was worthy to hold
I'm concerned with the soul, overstand?
When we was slappin up rappers they was doin the running man
You don't know my style, we be straight gunnin man
If you don't know you better ask your older brother man
Shit gets realer than, Real TV
From eighty-six, ain't no rapper realer than me
Or Just-Ice, I.C.U. or Steady B
What y'all waitin to see?  Somethin faker than me?
Don't let me have to pull out the Jamaican in me
I'd rather pull out the as-salamu alaykum in me
Wa-alaikum salaam, yo you wan' tess de Don?
BLAOW BLAOW BLAOW-BLOAW-BLAOW, bwoy gone!

They don't really wanna learn - well start gunnin 'em down!
Yo they really ain't concerned - well start gunnin 'em down!
They don't wanna get the book - well start gunnin 'em down!
They don't want a conscious hook - well start gunnin 'em down!
They don't wanna pay dues - well start gunnin 'em down!
They be actin brand new - well start gunnin 'em down!
They don't wanna get the light - well start gunnin 'em down!
Yo, pass me the mic - we'll start gunnin 'em down!

Watch dis!  Your crew is my crew and my crew is my crew
Your crew you lied to, my crew will find you
The light I recite will blind and outshine you
Street cats be wonderin why they even signed you
Where they find you?  
WHO is the first cat to rap
""wa-da-da-ding"" and show you what the nine do?
You ain't never seen me behave with them firearms
Maybe not, cause you just a slave to Viacom
Me, I'm a free MC hip-hopper
I teach real gangsters, hang with real Godsters
I am to hip-hop what Selassie is to rastas
Watch your mouth before someone I don't know pops ya
Lemme stop, don't-a-stop the street rhetorhic, ha
Your soul you sellin it ha, come wit some better shit, ha
In five years your whole catalogue's irrelevant ha
You spit the ignorance while I spit intelligence
You got it backwards like sayin hop-hip

Get Your Mind Right,Never Forget,2013,"What you 'bout to hear, straight craziest
Higher level, nuclear MCin, I'm not paid for this
Because I'm made for this and hip hop history
None of my 19 albums have ever been miscellaneous
And I'm spontaneous
My radius goes out, the crowd falls out
Knowledge Reigns Supreme, I pour out
To my jaws now, yep, I bring the claws out
Knocked them 26 city tours out
I'm the truth, you can believe or doubt
But for those that believe in MCs like these
Higher degrees in sacred keys, believe, we knockin' them all out
Believe in yourself, stop deceivin' yourself
You listenin' that garbage all day, depletin' your health
And I ain't talkin' 'bout them youngings on the radio today
I'm talkin' 'bout them old folks that program what they say
They hated it, debated hip hop way back in the day
Now they wanna destroy it, they ain't love it anyway
But they put it on the radio, then blast it on your TV
Tellin' you, ""It's the way to go, right here, buy our CD""
And even when you get the CD, it's always a letdown
Cause you don't know about them MCs that truly get down
 x4
Get your mind right, you don't have to deal with hindsight
If you operate in foresight

Now you throw it up
You want respect, you want that victory, cohoo
You want that cash, you wanna live it up
Now you in the street, you have the E, you have Malcolmee
You independant and you feel the heat
But you will not give up, so now your phone ring and you pick it up
And it's your boy Park about to stick it up
It's the economy, he explain as he talk 'bout robbery
Right then you ax: ""Now what's inside of me?
Am I a robba', robba'? Am I a shocka', shocka'?
Am I a robba', robba', robba', i'ma, i'ma, i'ma
Am I a robba', robba'? Am I a shocka', shocka'?
Am I a robba', robba', i'ma, i'ma, i'ma, i'ma hang the phone up
Cause you know what? I see the future
It may look good now but jail ain't what I'm used to
The soul says give not take without giving
If that's the real you, then that's how you should start living
But we frontin', frontin'
Still huntin', huntin' for somethin', somethin'
But all this huntin', stuntin' droke cluckin' is leavin' at nothing
Start dustin', reach on the shelf and dust your soul off
You put it there, gettin' your goal off

I’m On the Mic,Life,UnKnown,"(Intro)
When you least expect it
(This is just one style)
(Verse One)
We back up in this piece like yeast to bread
Underground you gotta find me like an Easter egg
No need to beg, I hit the club hard on the red
While you check for CDs I'm sellin' books instead
I travel the country by car, by foot and leg
What's worse than being behind is being ahead
Prophetic visions of President Jeb
Five storms hit Florida on his head and nobody said
""What's the meaning of this? It's like God is dead""
In the minds of the people hanging onto a thread
You gotta go where your heart is led
I spit truth but some cats, they just got the hardest head
As you can see, I'm artist-led
I take it to the black, to the green, and to the darkest red
I write, recite and of course go off the head-top
Knowledge Reigns Supreme, man -- don't forget that
(Chorus)
KRS and I'm on the mic
(Class is in session, so you can stop guessin')
KRS and I'm on the mic
This is just one style
KRS and I'm on the mic
Knowledge Reigns Supreme Over Nearly Everybody
KRS and I'm on the mic
Listen
(Verse Two)
Here's the mission, plain and straight
We gotta nurture and develop what we create
Hip-hop is our activity on the planet
Today it's just an album; tomorrow they examine it
In the future, someone's crammin' fast
Cause they want at least a B in their hip-hop class
I ain't even askin' you how
If our ancestors built nations, why you ain't buildin' one now?
Technology is not civilization
Civilization is not about the tools that you're making
You have an opportunity, at a new stop
Truly living hip-hop is a chance at a new park
You can play a new part: Develop new DVDs, new books, new art
Open new food marts with hip-hop food charts and food carts
Playing 2Pac while you shop (Do it)
What's the sense of being a recording artist
At a recording company for a year or two
If after the third or fourth year they can't even hire you?
In fact there is really nothing there for you
If your life is not a can of goo
Hip-hop is not a product; hip-hop is me and you
What I spit will see you through
I'm freein' you with knowledge of G-O-D in you
(Chorus)
(Verse Three)
Foot soldiers, let's go - we got this
The freedom to be really you that's what hip-hop is
What can we really do? Reach for the top, kid
Those that seek the bottom they shot stop and lock, kid
We the inevitable, most credible
And most are leaning back with the terrible squad
Here to beat knock hard, this is the real truth
Everything I spit be backed up with real proof
Welcome to the underground
Don't look for me in the mainstream, this is a whole 'nother sound
Sound set we rock music in the streets
In the schools and over the Internet
Feel it yet? You ain't hear me yet
You ain't really ready to get near me yet
Y'all fear and fret

You Like Me,The World Is MIND,2017.0,"As long as I'm dancin

And nothin bout thinkin
As long as I'm high
And I never ask why
You like me (x4)
But the second I start with the state of the economy
Black leadership, Black gods and Black sovereignty
That's when you can't seem to follow me, confusion
You feel like you losin, I'm no longer amusin
This song's about choosin, choosin why you cruisin
Either Black entertainment or the Black Revolution
People love to see a young Black man rap
Until he wakes up and realize he's caught in the trap

But the minute I get in it bout the way these rappers spit it
The minute I start spittin that truth here comes a critic
I freestyle off the top like removin ya yankee fitted
But they not really checkin for skills, they want the gimmick
Many of the challenges we face, we could solve em
But there's no trust, no unity, and that's the problem
Black people fightin amongst themselves that's the problem
White people fightin amongst themselves that's the problem
US foreign policy is simply just bomb em
Rebels against they own government, the US arms em
Then when things get outta hand, yeah they try to calm em
More money, more diplomacy, just charm em
If that doesn't work then they move to ""Osama""
Turn him into a terrorist, so they can disarm em
Through the corporate media, we don't stand a chance
But too many people wanna us to just stand and dance
So as long as I'm dancin
Actin or rappin
Walkin around like
I don't know what's happenin
You like me (x4)

But the more they push me down the higher I raise
When I did criminal minded they had something to say
When I said self-destruction they had something to say
When I did edutainment they had something to say
That's the devil I ain't concerned with nothing they say
They was frontin' in the 90's and they still frontin'
They know the cost of everything but the value of nothing

Keep comin strong (uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh!)
Just keep movin on..

Yo, where's my people at?
We be where the elite be at
We really never need the gat, we comin with a sneak attack
In fact, best believe we back
What we rap it heats the track
Kenny Parker sees to that, my job is to teach these cats
Present the clear speech they lack
And show 'em how to eat from rap

We keep it tight.. we keep it right.. (that's right)
We're comin strong.. (uh-huh, yeah) we're movin on.. (tell 'em again!)
(Uhh) It's time to rise.. and unify.. (yeah, yeah)
Keep comin strong (uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh!)
Just keep movin on..

You know why the devil can't get with me?
Cause he's a liar, I've got victory
You can stick with me, my click is free
Negativity, that doesn't live with me
These rappers on one, I've skipped to three
These rappers on A, I've skipped to C
My image, heads ain't quick to be
So I thank you for pickin me
I know why people got to know, these wack rappers got to go
Let a MC rock the show
I'll show 'em how it 'posed to go
We forgot simply what we supposed to know
We still must defeat the foe
So what you got the dough? Your words don't make us glow
In fact they make us slow
How long this gonna take to know you ain't gotta be a ho?

Look at the teacher, I stay attuned
People are blessed when I walk in the room
Snakes(?) don't stop me, and if they did
They'd be askin for a tag 'fore they kids
Medical students lose it when I enter any hospital
Doctors wanna talk music and whatever's topical
It's all logical, I perform the impossible
Through words I put hip-hop in you; listen
Here's what we got to do, unify
Defeat the flesh, defeat the beast in you and I
Win or lose I never shout, believe in yourself and never doubt
Discipline is simply a better route

We keep it tight - we keep it tight
We keep it right - we keep it right
We're comin strong - comin strong
We're movin on - movin on!
It's time to rise - it's time to rise
And unify - unifyyyy
Keep comin strong - comin strong
Just keep movin on - keep on movin on
We keep it tight - we keep it tight
We keep it right - we keep it right
We're comin strong - we're comin strong
We're movin on - movin on!
It's time to rise - it's time to rise
And unify - it's time to unify
Keep comin strong
Just keep movin on - keep on movin on

At twenty-one things ain't funny

When you drop to thirty-two, and it occurs to you
When you drop to thirty-three, now you can see

That I don't need you
Nina, you gotta go
I gotta leave you
I gotta free you
Common I'ma free you

Back in the days I was fallen in love with you
I used to watch you, sit in the tub with you
We you used to cruise, you was right on my hip
I was 22, you was 22, that's it!
You fit so snug in my hand
The power, parents just don't understand
Ours  was a love forever
You was always ready and steady, steady and down for whatever
But your friends were 38 and others were 45
And when they was around, I'm surprised I even survived
So don't feel bad, I'm just growing up
Career blowing up, you gotta know whats up


When M was 16 and Glock was 9
They was there with me when I stared my rhyme
But when I started the climb and get known for rap
It seems like y'all was trying to hold me back
And not only that
You was my secret weapon, concealed weapon
We lived on the 357
Right on the corner of Smith and Wesson
When them dudes rolled up, you was the perfect blessing
But I learned my lesson, no doubt
Every time you shout
Somebodys lights in a night go out
Yo I'm out
I know what this bull  is about
You want me to beef all day so I could pull you out
But


In my younger days, I used to love your figure
You used to shout every time I pulled your trigger
But you're getting bigger
And your feedback is only clack clack clack
And I don't need that
Its like a speed rap, I wanna slow it down
I want intelligent, good people to come around
And they don't get down to your kind of way
See
They settle their differences in a long minded way
So in the meantime
I'm a keep trying, I worked it out
Well you can stay with Mad lion
He might have work for you
I just don't want you to ever think that I'm deserting you

Move the crowd, that's what MC mean
How many albums I got? Mmmm...12, 13
I've told y'all before
You are not just doin' hip-hop, you are hip-hop
Them jokers need to stop, be hip-hop
I mastered this and him, her, they, them, that one
She and he did not
I speak a lot, I hit 'em in they weakest spot
Come see me rock, yo, you'll leave in shock
KRS, you ever wonder why he's so hot?
It's because he's not pop yo, he's hip-hop
West to East the sound of the police will rock
If you don't love this you won't have the heat I got
Discipline, if you're listenin, defeats the COPS
Fuck the dumb shit yo, we gotta teach the tots
They say I preach a lot
And last year the took the jeep and shot
But this year the beat will knock

I know where
We can go
To see how a real MC flow
No video
No radio
Just a live show
C'mon now you gon' go?

I'm still standing, demanding playing my lex jammin'
Cats wanna really see me start blam-blammin'
Put away the cannon for this overstandin'
I'm landin'
Let the music play like Shannon
I'm so hot, why not, I bring all the fans in
Watch me now come alive like Peter Frampton
Listen to me people, listen to me loud and clear
It's time I found out what type of people up in here
When I shout out the classic if you know it say yeah
South Bronx-Yeah!
My Philosophy-Yeah!
Black Cop-Yeah!
You Must Learn-Yeah!
Yeah we gonna do it up in here
I'm still standin'
And rappers be mad-mad
Cause they know they'll give birth like the American
Flag in Baghdad
All they do is blab-blab, that head chatter
Why the dopest MC always a dead rapper?
I'm a real live rapper, I'm out to set it
I pay dues, while your crews still on credit
You talk that shit till I come out the school
And all y'all sound like Trina sayin' ""That's Cool""
Time for the streets again
Time for them cats to pop gats into the mic you speakin' in
I'm creepin' in with a hundred soldiers
When I step on the stage it's over


They don't play me a lot
KRS you don't see a lot
On TV a lot, but I do MC a lot
I don't duck and hide when I see the cops
I'm free with the knowledge to free the block
Live on the radio I'm sendin' my rhyme, you can see
I'm behind enemy lines
You already heard about plenty of crime
Now hear about the sciences that could really open ya mind
I only got a little bit of time to rhyme before the
Producer over here says ""Ok, that's fine""
So let's get to it, I got my whole squad with me
On top'a all that I got God with me
You can go far with me
From New York, to Atlanta, to LA
You know they all with me
You might not see me on this station cause this is a
Rapcity and KRS leads a Hip-Hop nation
Even though y'all chase ends
Why can't weeeeee be friends, it all depends
Cats wanna thug it out
Isn't it true that Hip-Hop was bigger when we all loved it out?
Look at the difference in raps
See when I'm spittin' the facts
Louder than anyone could rap, the industry collapse
No one's special anymore
Variety is gone for sure",https://genius.com/Krs-one-you-gon-go-lyrics
Ain’t Ready,Spiritual Minded,UnKnown,"Uhh! They don't wanna battle
They ain't ready for the battle, uh-uh, uh-uh (Temple of Hip-Hop)
Listen, listen, listen

Your spirit AIN'T READY
Your church AIN'T READY
Your bishop AIN'T READY
Your deacons AIN'T READY
Your choir AIN'T READY
Your ushers AIN'T READY
At the Temple of Hip-Hop
WE TEACH MANY!

Look! To all my people hurtin, all my people searchin
What we know for sure, God is always workin
Workin while you flirtin, workin while you jerkin
Workin while the world is turnin and these cities burnin
God is always workin, workin while you learnin
Workin while you ignorant and when you're not concernin
Christ consciousness, get that, got that
Spit that, rock that, hip that, hop that
You sniff that? Stop that, I give back and got back
Greedy? I'm not that, 
you needy for that shock rap
Slangin on the block rap, duckin where the cops at
I don't know that, but Jesus done copped that
Not that man on the cross, it ain't like that
You must act like the son of God, that's where the lights at
Stop readin only and start bein show me
Like the resurrection I'll be back, they can't hold me


One thing's for sure and believe it hurt
It's when the pastor ain't sure, and deceives the church
They don't know God's law, and can't see God at work
So when they see hip-hop, they push it to the back of the church
Like fig trees or figures they don't bear fruit
They gospel artists, still tryin to chase that loot
Hear the truth now, I come to enhance the light
They women of God, singin while they pants is tight?
They not hot! Really they, regular
They clothes they flows, all that, secular
What's the difference I could stay in the world and wild
If these church girls wear more makeup than Destiny's Child
Keep it real Christian, some of y'all liftin ain't likin
But this is the difference between a Christian and a Christ-ian
Stop readin only and start bein show me
Like the resurrection I'll be back, they can't hold me
.. listen, listen, listen


Look! Spiritual minded, you must find it
Find your spirit and go deep inside it
This goes out to the Christians listenin
This is the flow that, gospel's missin it's
Urban inspirational rap
We got our own section in the record stores, in our own rack
We respect tradition from the start
But we now know the true word of God is written in our heart
We gotta say something to the streets kid!
All these churches surrounding the Devil still ain't defeat it?
They the type to get down, I'm the type to get up
From ""Criminal"" to ""Spiritual Minded"", now raise your head up
Let me start, these rappers ain't got God in they heart
All they want is quick money and a movie part
Let me begin, what, where, why or when
What's the use of double platinum if you're living in sin
Hear the truth, how long you think you gonna last
Rockin the mic, without having to go back to class?
Now you're forced, to listen to the teacher out rap them
Yes there's life after platinum",https://genius.com/Krs-one-aint-ready-lyrics

While KRS-One appeals more to the intelligent
On January 30th, 1906
3000 Africans were killed by some bricks, they don't quit
British troops to be excact, is called the Bambatha Massacre
This took place in South Africa
May 4th, 1978, they still kill
7000 African men, women and children
Tell the world I told ya
This particular killing took place in Cassinga, Angola
But wait there's others
White democrats murdered 60 more African brothers
This took place in Louisiana
And it's called the Coushatta massacre - know your history


I resemble the herbal when I'm in your mental
I go ungentle, never beginning or ending like a circle
Purple raised emmenagogue from my meditation state
You nift your consciousness when you lift my tape
I'm givin' you these dates tough you'd hate
But to evaluate your own mental state
You're gettin' older not younger
The system keeps you under
Concentrate on living this summer
Check it: 1963, the 15th of September
Four girls are bombed by the KKK
Remember, August 26, 1874
16 Africans are lynched in Tennessee, want some more?
May 14th, 1970
Police killed two African students at Jackson State University
And injured fourteen others
For years America been killing us - sisters, brothers


Give me lyrical skills that build or give me death
When these rappers are out of breath I have two hours worth of rhymes left
You can kill a man by taking him out his land
And putting him in the land he doesn't understand
They teach him to respect Greek mythology
Like Pythagoras, Ptolomies, Socrates
These people are thieves
They stole astronomy, mathematics, all tactics of biology
Even the concept of democracy, stolen from the king Akhenaten
Now logically look, put down the book, use your brain
If you don't know who you are, you are clinically insane
The board of education can't see that
To they deserve to get beaten and robbed by black
Give me my frame of mind back, give me my culture
But they don't understand that because they suckers",https://genius.com/Krs-one-what-i-know-lyrics

Free Mumia!
Channel Live! (KRS-One)
Hah hah hah hah hah hahaha!
Free Mumia!

Everywhere I look there's another house negro
Talkin' about they people and how they should be equal
They talkin, but the conversation ain't goin' nowhere
You can't diss hip hop, so don't you even go there
C. Delores Tucker, you wanna quote the scripture
Everytime you hear nigga, well listen up sista

I met up with this girl named Delores, a prankster
I said I MC, she said, ""You're a gangster""
But she was caught up, she hit the floor like a breakdance
Wrapped her up like the arms in a b-boy stance
You'll have money cause I hear you get stars
She said, ""Where you from?""
I said, ""I was born up in the South Bronx
But now I reside across America""
She said: ""You the one who be causing all that mass hysteria
Wisdom shall come out of the mouths of babes and sucklings
But you blinded by cultural ignorance and steady judging
But judge not, lest ye may be judged
For the judgment ye judge, ye shall surely be judged, you gets no love
She said, ""I like it, that's why I jock it""
Then I said: ""You only on my dick because I fill brotha's pockets
Cut the bullshit, take me to your pad""
She said: ""Im'a give you the ass because I like the way your pants sag""
Spread the legs with the other hand she threw the kitty
Then I sprayed jizm like graffiti on her titties
Freestyled all night, no doubt
That bitch couldn't get enough cause she was strung the fuck out
 x2
Warner, Elektra, Atlantic equals WEA
Instead of fighting them why don't you go free Mumia

Wild recital, I kicks the vital, like the Final
Call, as I watch, Babylon fall
I had to Rush Limbaugh, hit that pig with an axe
Tuffy dips to the side, buckin' cannons that phat
Because he censored the uses of the metaphor
You can get the tip of my dick Gore
Because it's you that brings the real horrorcore
Expenditures forgettin', cut from the poor
Why sure! Back before we were born, they sold us out
Yeah, J. Jackson, we know what you about
Back when you was running for the presidencey and competing
All rap was dope, you loved every beat and
But you took the beating
You was using us then, like you're using us now
In the National Urban League, I don't know how
You figure the Stop the Violence Movement gave you six hundred thousand, nigga
And now you quicker to diss, I get with miss Tucker
You better find another you sell-out motherfuckers
Hate to be so rough, it could be the White Owls
House niggas are full of shit, like my Colin Powell
Kickin vowels, is how we relieve the tension
Until we start to bounce white people like suspension
You paint the picture, it's the black man on the corner
But tell me, who blew up Oklahoma?
The City, ain't no pity, for the beast
It's Hakim, that voice from the East
 x2

Buck-buck! Buck-buck-buck!
It sound like gunshots but it could be the cluck of a chicken, definition is what you're missin' and
Listen to your children instead of dissin' em
Senator Dole doesn't understand the younger
Like they be sayin', ""Want to"", but we be sayin', ""Wanna""
They gettin' dumber every summer, as they walk the road
Mainly because they cannot understand the code
In actuality, this Norman Bates mentality
Always seems to represent, minus three-sixty percent
Or degrees full circle, dead from the purple
Rays of the sun I gots melanin so check it
Bag your nuts quick or get sick from being naked
Suspect it, was it a means for the end
For just a few to drive the Benz while you eat the pigskins
Turned you into mannequins is the trick of technology
A revelation, revalations
Sensation gives me inspiration of revolution
That's my solution, there will be no sequels
I'm Audi hundred forty four thousand with my people
From Caligula to Hitler, and now it's Schwarzenegger
A lust for the violence is the science of their behavior
Who enslaved ya (it's the Devil) but the God of virtuosity
And of the world created, could it be mental sodomy
Got my mind twisted like the blades of fonta leaf
I sit in disbelief as he crawls underneath
The rock cock back the Glock cause I don't trust
The Devil, I rebel until Babylon is dust

 South South, Bronx!
 Yo where my heart is at?
 South South, Bronx!
 C'mon let's bring it back
 South South, Bronx!

Raw rhymes for raw times
My albums are underground, but this blessing is all mine
And when it's tour time, we open more minds
You need to rethink who you think is the ""Greatest of All Time""
I got this -- I'm raw like Freddie Foxxx is
Hardcore like The LOX is, Scott LaRock is where 2Pac is
Where hip-hop is, Digital-ly Underground like Shock is
Oh yes -- I know where the top is
But I'd rather rhyme about how crooked some of these cops is
My synopsis ain't pretty
I'd stay, off them plains and, out the city if I were you
Do what you gotta do
But while you wave them flags, remember Amadou .. Diallo
Here's what we gotta do, follow
I'll put hip-hop in you if you're hollow
Those that already filled, STILL take swallows
Goin over potholes with Tahoes
You don't think +I+ know?  Huh!  I'm lookin at you right now
You ain't dancin in the club, you in your car, sittin down
You in the crib, on the low
You got them headsets on the go
You just saw me at the show - oh you don't know?
It's the Temple of Hip-Hop, comin, with a whole DIFFERENT flow
Yo where them hoes at?  I don't know
But wherever God at, I'mma go
I give 'em a hard rap AND a flow
That's why when they call back for the show, with no video
We get up and go!

 Yo where it started at?
 South South, Bronx!
 Yo where my people at?
 South South, Bronx!
 Yo where my heart is at?

Peep it out while I tell ya like this
In every single hood in the WORLD I'm called Kris
It's the, truth for ya, it's the proof for ya
My Cristal passes more bars than lawyers
The underground sound, this is not easily found
You don't need no rings to be down
This is, past the platinum and gold
We already had 'em, it's old
Here's the truth if it be told, gather 'round
Philosopher style is known to be wild
If you only holdin them guns, who's holdin your child?
You got to be thinkin you KNOW that you shrinkin
When the art of Navigation has been reduced to a Lincoln
Change the dial!  I was free then and I'm free now
You free, runnin to MTV?  I don't see how!
You know the real from the fake, you know they stealin they cake
You know it ain't about the art, it's all about what they make
You know the radio's late, you know they play what you hate
That's why you got that Kay Slay tape, tryin to escape
You know the love of the cars and the rims
Tattooed arms and Timbs, are also called sins
You know you got to pay for these spins
You know the rap magazines be wack from beginning to the end
BO!


I never was a king and I'm not the Pres
I'm a teacher like that reefer goin straight to your head
I'm a preacher tryin to bring my people back from the dead
I'm a leader tryin to keep you all away from the feds
You my sister I'll be tryin to get you OUT of the bed
I'm a philospher sayin what has GOT to be said
I don't FILL you with lead, I bring that KNOWLEDGE instead
FOLLOW this dread, I'll take you from A to Zed
Who am I?  Just a scholar called K-R-S
You can spend your money on others but THEY AIN'T BLESSED
You can spend your money drugs and STILL BE STRESSED
Look around for conscious rappers yo there AIN'T NONE LEFT
I'm holdin it down; better yet I'm holdin up
Waitin for some young buck to come and sip from the cup
And continue with the menu puttin new knowledge in you
I got a question and a lesson cause I KNOW what you been through
But..

I battle with expedience and obedience, you macking the ingredients
Hiphop youre not being it!!Youre trying it
My whole style right now youre I and it
I'll take ya dark demo and put the sky in it
You say youre dope but like an Elvis Presly CD I ain buying it

Watcha really thinking bout when you wanna think it out!?
When I'm bout to bring it out the terror that I sing a bout?
If you do the crime then you must do the time and
If you kick a rhyme and its wack thats your behind and...
Dont be blinded looking this way 'cause you'll be fine dead
My career going up-hill while yours declining
I'm the bomb on foot K-1 land mind

Its time for me to get on and represent the Bronx
So lets set this shit off like this
Uhh, now check it
Underground verbal hip hop you selected
By only a few, this type of artist is bought
So like Bartles & James thank you for your support
It's time for all this chit-chat to skit-skat
Arent you tired of hearin ple-ple-ple-ple-pla
Rase the level of your listenen pleasure a letter
And let the teacher put these new jacks under pleasure
My first name is hip hop no doubt
My last name is run with me breath for breath
Yes I'll blow your lungs out
BLOW! And cut your tongue out
And use that shit to clean my rug out
I ain't even start to bug out
Somebody requested for the teacher to get active
Cuz of all these rappers I look good to battle
Im unattractive when actively in your brain cavity
You be singin 1-2-3, and your family B-D-P
I'm Total 'Can't you see'
I took it there
You bee sayin with your swollin eye
Damn it just ain't fuckin fair
But your crew told you what was up
You just didn't give a fuck
My lyrics are intact
So my picture you can pin it up
Take me out? Give it up your late
I rocked the 9-1-7 when it was 7-1-8
I'm a juvenile deliquent group home lord of the state
The truth about the matter is that I feel great
I'm comin in the form of the mind-bender bar tender
Servin that lyrical-net serve your chest then send a
Remember battlin MC's Im not always doin
Cuz we need new rappers and careers I always ruin
What are you pursuin, who in the hell want this friction
I'll volt your scene and make you drum machine start blitchin
Switchin my diction, I'm quick you need a fixin-
Im quick to turn you off like the light in a kitchen
Chorus -sample/scratching of-
Cuz Krs One means simply one Krs
Thats it, thats all solo, single the one no less
Verse
I do my dirt and I keep it to myself
I don't speak it on record and to no one else
You think about...
When you do crimes you talk about it
HELL NO!  You keep that real shit on the low
Cuz prison ain't a place you motherfuckers wanna be at
Half of you motherfuckers would turn trick
BELIEVE THAT!
Yo I can see that, all you ask is where the weed at?
You vision is as far as whereever you throw the seed at
Look at Malcolm X and try to be that
Or get lost if you can't pick up where Malcolm X left off
Don't you know were listened to by judges and lawyers
When you go to court they play your album for ya
Then you turn into Tom Sawyer fiction
Beggin a judge to just listen sayin...
If you listen to my album twice, the positive message is....
They shut yo ass up and give you life
Had you hah a wife instead of bein a lover
The court would of seen you as a family man wit some structure
But you is a wild brother, black women you can't respect em
Now you catchin wreck in your rep
Negativity never had no pull in jail
Yeah, its positivity that they hail
But you fail, cuz red books you can't read em
Your people you mislead em
Your people you mistreat em
Mislead em for fun...my name is KRS ONE!

I'm giving careers and taking careers away, did you forget that?
Better check that, you can rock this track and the next track
But when I correct the spirit hit, you'll always be set back

I Will Make It,The Sneak Attack,2001,"Instead of reading the word of Christ, BE the word of Christ
Instead of following God's word, BE God's word

You are not just doing hip-hop, you ARE hip-hop
You are not just reading the word of God, you ARE the word of God
 I will make it
 I will make it!
 They can fake it

 Time that I state it
 I can create it
 I create it
 No one can make it

For me, what you see is what you get in these days
I'm so hungry you can throw my dinner right on the stage
You can bite down on my rage, bite down on my anticipation
With no doubt or hesitation, repeat this affirmation
(I WILL MAKE IT) Not I wanna make it
(SHOW 'EM HOW WE MAKE IT) In fact, we've made it
Every time we state and believe it we create it
The power of your very word is highly underrated
Sleepin in the dark in the park watchin others push they cart
Say this whole thing in your heart
 I will make it
 I will make it!
 They can fake it

 Time that I state it

In a positive direction my lifestyle I'm leadin
I'm readin about ways of achievin what I'm believin
Every time I'm speakin I'm seein myself leapin
Over buildings, over the one on the corner chillin
Straight into knowledge of self, countin up millions
Changin my situation, with creative visualization
Givin libation for this ancient information
 I will make it

I ain't waitin' for the system to save me
I'm standing up, using what God gave me

I Got You,Adventures in Emceein,2008,"Off beat, what you know about it?
All heat, all street, my dough I be about it
I eat all week, I don't need to shout it
I'm legendary, in many books you can read about it
Well I'm back to let you cats know that
I'm not asleep, I heard your mixtape raps
What, you think I'm weak like one of these old school cats?
You better hear me speak before you get holes in your back
Ain't nothing here sweet except your whole damn pack
Why I gotta return? Cause y'all's so damn wack wack
You never will learn. That's why the teacha's back
Now you gon' feel that real golden age rap
Unfolding the gat
This ain't no place for no amateur block rap
Rappin' about your hammer is cocked back
That means you fuckin' with a six-shooter
And we got big guns that can stop that
All you hear is klug-clack-klug, klug-clack-klug
And you and your man y'all fall backward
Y'all ain't nothin' but actors, bitin' like Dracula
Kris spit spitacular

To my block - I got you
From the bottom to the top - I got you
When you need that raw HipHop - I got you
I mean that '94 HipHop - I got you
If you ain't got nowhere to go - I got you
VIP passes to my show - I got you
Come to my crib, let's take it slow - I got you
Never forget, you gotta know that - I got you

You listenin' to the depth of the heat
I'm omni-hood, that means I rep' every street
When I come around cats get up and eat
On the mic I won't let up 'til the end of the beat
I stay tight when I recite and sendin' you heat
Let's compare, what's your agenda this week?
Me? I be chillin' out in sacred buildings with my children
Free as a fly on the ceiling

I know we ain't gettin soft, HUT HUT HUT HUT!
I know we ain't gettin soft, listen

When you advertise in New York
You best to beware, oh yes
When you advertise in New York, you best to beware
Cause the bling bling, and de sex t'ing
Dem no care, oh no, you best to beware
Oh no, yo you best to beware, oh no noooo

This is how they do it kid, I thought you knew it kid
This is how they set us up listen I can prove it kid
Many don't understand, you see it's all a plan
To keep the black man a child like he's Peter Pan
You'll never see a man, a real black man
Until you see a man with control of his hands
And to control your hands means you control your mind
And to control your mind means you ain't commitin crimes
Man you smarter than that, goin to prison is whack
Even the people in prison know I'm spittin the facts
I'm gettin open, open the class up
Don't smoke crack it'll tear yo' ass up


Listen! We got our own problems here in the States
So you know I'm not pointin the finger BUT WAIT
This is somethin y'all got to see
Even the UN knows violence begins with poverty
When you ain't got no money, it's quicker to kill
It's human nature that's way the jails are filled
And the MILITARY? From the time you sign up
To kill your neighbor man it's a SIN already
And SIN meaning Selfish Inconsiderate Needs
Gimme what I want! I don't care who bleeds
These days people ready to steal and rob
All in the name of I'm DOING MY JOB~!
But what about doing your work, what's your purpose?
No human being is worthless
Think about this before you pull the trigger
And you call your sister a bitch and your brother a - WHOA


Knowledge Reigns Supreme again, ignorance is weakenin
Truth is what I'm speakin when I'm reachin and teachin my friends
Life is more than just cars and lust
Unity is a must, we need to build trust
Open up your mind to this, raisin up your consciousness
Whether you a pessimist, strategist or optimist
My synopsis is knowledge ain't where college is
Knowledge is for leaders and wisdom is for philosophers
Now I'm hearin London gettin violence like Brooklyn was
Brothers gettin shot just for lookin cuz?
I thought we deaded that, we need to be headed back
Yo France, you need to be coverin your brother's back
Bring the lovin back, cause the government don't love you
They into murder, money, and stayin above you
They want you all in prison
So before you kill your sister or brother stop and listen",https://genius.com/Krs-one-beware-lyrics
Phucked,Keep Right,2004.0,"Yeah
Y'know when advice is in your face, you need to heed that
Word, you need to read that
Y'know, I put this lil' joint together real quick
You know what it's called?
It's called - NOW YOU'RE FUCKED!
That's right, listen

Wasn't you the type to mimic what you saw on TV?
Wasn't you the type to mimic what you heard on CD?
You never wanted to work you wanted everything easy
You heard KRS and you said, ""That's preachy!""
A wise young man says, ""Father - teach me""
A foolish young man wants to live life freaky
Oh yes, Knowledge does Reign Supremely
When I said it eighty-nine you didn't believe me
NOW YOU'RE FUCKED! .. that's right
NOW YOU'RE FUCKED! .. life is over, finished, done
NOW YOU'RE FUCKED! .. better heed that, read that
NOW YOU'RE FUCKED!

Listen - back in the days on the Boulevard of Linden
BROOKLYN!  Kris was a, metaphysician
LOOKIN!  For better ways to live without bein
TOOKEN!  We started our own management and
BOOKIN!  Makin moves with them live cats on
FULTON!  I can't even 'member all the dough that we
TOOK IN!  But you was lookin down on us
Cause platinum never astounded us, so
NOW YOU'RE FUCKED! .. word, like that
NOW YOU'RE FUCKED! .. ha, you shoulda heed that, you better
NOW YOU'RE FUCKED! .. y'all was chasin the radio, remember that?
NOW YOU'RE FUCKED! .. what they givin you back now?

Back when we was all singin ""Monie in the Middle""
You wanted to wiggle, jiggle in a tight skirt and giggle
Even when outside was brittle, you still had on little
And KRS warned that you'll get played like a fiddle
Now you havin cravings for pickles cause you pregnant
And don't know where the dad went and you poppin them drugs like Skittles
When the baby is born it's little and sick
But it's no riddle, you was movin too quick, huh
NOW YOU'RE FUCKED! .. word, look at this
NOW YOU'RE FUCKED! .. you shoulda stayed home and read a book
NOW YOU'RE FUCKED! .. literally, symbolically
NOW YOU'RE FUCKED!

When advice is in your life you need to take it
Cause frankly, everybody ain't gonna make it
Back in the days we, showed 'em the way
I put it there in the music but you weren't amazed
You would criticize, debate, and basically hate
But let it be known I wanted everyone to be great
But you would diss and not even try to do better
When we was at the U.N. you said ""whatever""
NOW YOU'RE FUCKED! .. word
NOW YOU'RE FUCKED! .. we movin ahead, you still in the same spot

Ocean Within,Slam: The Soundtrack,UnKnown,"Word..
Sonja.. you know you saw her in the movie
And my man Saul, he's like THIS!
 * singing *
There is no ocean like the one, within
Look to the moon rise with the tides, and swim
(repeat 4X)
 * speaking while Saul sings *
Uh-huh, yeah, yeah
KRS-One, coming through.. like this
Uh-huh, do it, do it like that, like that
Uh, uh-huh
 * sings first two lines *
Saul the road to Damascus, come follow me
The serpent swallow the moon
, but it won't, swallow me
(Yeah, speak the word!)
Intellect is like a major city
Laden with concrete, metal
Advanced modes of transportation
Shining buildings, and fenced in parks
Spirit is the mountain's forest wilderness
And vast countryside that surrounds it
Too many people live in the city
Struggling day to day for mere existance
Most have forgotten how to live off the land
They only experience nature on class trips
And short-term vacations
For those that live in the country
Cities are like amusement parks with high prices
And temporal satisfaction
At the end of the day, they are tired
And ready to go home, and relieve their ringing ears
 * singing *
There is no ocean like the one, within
Look to the moon rise with the tides, and swim
(repeat 2X)

Uh-huh, speak the word
Hyper-accelerated meditations talk
The reversal of this word dispersal is thought
There is no difference between thought and talk
Like the blackboard chalk and homicide chalk
They both give outlines
One is designed to outline the mind
The other outlines the body after a crime
Could it be that these two chalks are connected;
Meaning the body gets outlined when the mind is neglected --
-- or poorly directed
Like the teacher with the chalk
Or is the teacher the beginning of the homicide we talk?
Be selective in your speech
Cause the chalk of the two technical teaching has taught each
Knowledge Reigns Supreme Over Nearly Everyone
Nearly every daughter, nearly every son
Ignorance reigns supreme for some
They chase the sum, inviting the I-R-S to come
Make the connection, choose your direction
Use your protection when sexin AND hexin
Things come back cause they really never left
If the secret to meditation is found in the breath
Then speech is another form of meditativeness
Whattya say to this latest rhyme or poem?
Some have been known to quite the mind through

It’s Gettin’ Hectic,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Times are critical, although I kick the metaphysical
Sometimes my rhymes flow kind of political
All the real B-boys make noise
Here comes the bomb yo, please stay calm yo, see I'm though
Happy chappy wind up and slap me one hitter, critter
Each year, I'm bigger, thicker, lyrics moving quicker
It's true, I got more styles up there
So I'll put it together and come out with an album every single year
Listen here, something new is going on
So of course Blast Master says it faster in a song
As you noticed the Bush Administration
Dealt with foreign affairs through the United Nations
In the UN, the Europeans have seniority
Yet in the world of nations, whites are the minority
This doesn't balance out for no nation
Check it, the UN is like the world plantation
There's more dark skin force than white forces
But Europeans are raping their resources
To be more specific while I'm rhyming
Resources mean oil, gold, minerals, diamonds
Anything to make the European riches a minority
They need this but there's one glitch
They concentrated much on international
But not enough on the thinking of the national
So while the Bush administration was outside
Yes the Clinton administration will be inside
Anything that affects the way you think
In music, in television, in writing, or out of the shrink
Cause if you start bugging within the nation
That messes up with what goes on in other nations
Not only Blacks but whites are starting to see the hypocrisy
Cause they're fed up with the economy
They're not uniting Europe for Europeans
They're uniting Europe to enslave the world of human beings
So rise up, there's little time to dance
To the youth in Great Britain, U.S., and France
Never forget, you might have to set it
Yo, things are getting hectic


If I can make you think there's something's wrong in my song
Then my song is a threat to what's going on
We've had years of free debate
Now they're gonna clean out rap in every single state
You'll see less and less on your television
And you'll see more and more violence and tongue kissing
Before I leave this point, I'll give you more
Explicit lyrics stickers is supported by Tipper Gore
Al Gore's wife, a White House resident
Vice president to the president, I think you're getting it
Rap music has the most influence yet, you bet
So now, it's a military threat
Anything that changes how you feel changes how you act
That's a threat, and that's rap
Racist mothers and fathers hate Black
But their children be chilling with Black kicking that rap
More and more White kids feel what we feel
You'll see more White kids with a mic on the wheels of steel
And that ain't the global plan
I haven't even discussed Japan
Japanese youth love Black youth
In Japan, there's no racists in the DJ booth
Just truth, screaming from the microphone
So the object is to shut down the head right here at home
Never forget it, you might have to set it

We can go to the poetry rappin of of sister Son.. Sonia Sanchez
With uh The Watts Poets, or The Last Poets
We can get into the political or the message rap
Of The Honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan, Malcolm X
Or The Honorable Elijah Muhammad
We can get into the the the the party and fun raps
Of Pigby Markam{?}, Marks Baby{?}
We can go back to the ""Hi De Hi De Ho"" with Cab Calloway
We can go back to the radio disc jockey or jocko
Eddie OJ, and all the others that did things
We can go back to the LOVE RAP of Isaac Hayes, Black Moses
To the LOVE RAP of Barry White out there
This is all part of rap
And if all you country people want to get into the country & western thing
We can take it to, Tony Joe White, when he did ""Poke Salad Annie""

I can't leave my b-girls alone

C'mon y'all let's get into the zone
Vibrate or mute or cellular phone
In here they might already be on roam
Minds are blown, I'm showin
You ain't gotta go major you can do it alone
As I look back on all the years, all the tears
All my peers, in fear
I hear, insecurity, the need for clout
Low self-esteem and self doubt
KRS lays out a whole different route
And shows you what hip-hop is really all about
Then we on the route, release self doubt
And sing with the feds when the fear is out now
Clear 'em out now, from the bottom to the tip-top
Take the vow, I am hip-hop
And recreate yourself, love don't hate yourself
Do not deny or lie or fake yourself
You can make yourself, reawake yourself
You can mold remodel and reshape yourself
You gotta take yourself more seriously
Create yourself to what you really can be~!
Yo the villain is free, look at me, I do what I do
I am hip-hop and so are you
Yo we almost through, but before we go
I wanna invite y'all all, to every show
Where the b-boys and girls are kept on their toes

So now you know, if you got what it takes
No doubt, show 'em what you really all about!

Hip-Hop can be more than MC's and dancers
It's time to expand your
Awareness, consciousness, enhance your
Living, tell me, what are you playing for
What are you staying for, what are you giving?
I will demand your respect, with two MC's
Two b-boys, two DJ's on set
Two hour shows you bet!
We get authentically hip-hop as hip-hop can get
Independent, free from debt
2005 you ain't seen nuttin yet
Some like it dry, some like it wet
Some like to give, some like to get
Some like a good soundset
You a b-boy and you ain't been out to the Bronx yet?
No, yes, maybe, someday
Whatever, we bring it to you Sunday to Sunday
Workin for peace love unity and fun day

Hip Hop Is One,UnKnown,2014.0,"KRS-One interview:
{If hip-hop has the ability to corrupt young minds, it also has the ability to uplift them}
Intro:
Cause I'm seein' bright visions of how we should be livin'
Unified, strong, makin' our own decisions
Verse 1:
Hip-hop city, higher minds will listen
Some won't get it and find time for dissin'
But I always been ahead of the preservation mission
So I alway's been a head of the preservation mission
And what one sure way to preserve, what we spittin', reserve what we've written
Reserve how we wigglin', preserve how we mix it, our raw sound
It's the finally established of small hip-hop resort town
A place for artist's from all over the earth
Could come and find peace, could come and spit they verse
Could find support of all sorts for arts done for fun
To achieve this, hip-hop we must become one
Hook:
(KRS-One sample saying, ""One"", repeatedly in the background throughout)
We must become one, you know
Hip-hop is one
(KRS-One sample saying, ""One"", repeatedly in the background)
KRS Interview:
{So if we come with a balance and play everything, we will find ourselves not reflecting just product and markets, but life itself}
Verse 2:
My style of raps hard to find, I believe that every rapper has a larger mind
But they spit the sex, spit the murder, spit the crime
Cause they told if they do it they'll be livin' fine
People know it's only music, y'all don't mind
But every now-and-then I question what these rappers say and rhyme
Take yo time, I send this out to every rapper sayin rhymes, and every DJ out there playin mine
You know I don't live for the prime time
But out of all these rap names, young people should be able to find mine
Knowledge Reigning Supreme,
 I shine, shine like the sun
It's time for hip-hop to become one
Hook:
(KRS-One sample saying, ""One"", repeatedly in the background throughout)
Woooh
Yup, come on, we must become one
UNITY! That's what it's about
Hip-Hop is one
Yo, yeah, come on, we must become one
(KRS-One sample saying, ""One"", repeatedly in the background)
KRS Interview:
{Im crying out for balance along with a whole bunch of family around the world, they wanna to see balance.}
Verse 3:
So what I'm talkin' bout, I'm talkin' bout a plan fast
We're the richest hip-hopper's, we buy a land mass
Put out a call to see the skill that every man has
I put this on the love, that every fam has
Exodus, over da sea, we can pass
Into our own hip-hop city, turn over the sand glass
This sounds as if we just found our gift
A hip-hop town is bound to uplift
Our town has, no controls, the cops you gotta ring em up
Moms is safe, kid's you can bring em up
Just streets are patrolled by doctors and lawyers
Because you don't need law if you already have order
We are one
Hook:
(KRS-One sample saying, ""One"", repeatedly in the background throughout)
We must become one, you know
Hip-hop is one, woooh, hip-hop is one
Yup, come on, we must become one

Hip-hop is one
Yo, yeah, come on, we must become one

Generique Assault,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Yeah... KRS-One bout to wreck the joint
I was seen openin up at the edge of Detroit
Where the cops go beyond the laws
Where enemies work together by putting they shit on pause
So what does it mean, Assault on Precinct 13?
You are bout to see just what the dirt brings
It's working, that force, I have been searching
Like Lawrence Fishburne when it's time to hurt things
Ethan Hawke, man he face all that
I hold the mic like Ja held the baseball bat
I stay ahead, like a baseball cap
The ways of the world, Kris don't chase all that

We gettin up outta here, that's what's up. That's what's up
Watch me back up the truck
You livin wit a lot of fear. That's what's up, my gats stay up

You livin wit a lot of fear. That's what's up, my gats stay up
So crooked cops you backin me up?

Well as I walk through the street, my spirit will speak
To those I meet and great from week to week
I am not my handsome beat. I command the speak
As the observer inside the physique
Many rappers try to compete, of course
But they got smashed and trashed in the streets and tossed
Sometimes I think we all just lost
We just flashin and flossin the disasterous cause
We don't even know the one-ness of the only force
Instead of a golden calf, we got a platinum horse
But what did Moses do with the golden calf?
Threw the log at it and it ended in a blast
Master, get on them quick, get on them faster
In the background you frontin, cuz there's nothing but laughter
I tag church like the shirt king
Turn up the track for Assault on Precinct 13

Wow, what an ending. What a conclusion
They thought they was winning, but they really was losing
He though he was sinnin, but he really was proving
That leadership keeps it moving, steady cruising
Guns up, funds up, from sun up to sun up to sun up
Buck buck buck! Yo, duck duck
We run up, two down, one up
Dope MCs see me and get butterflies in they stomach
Others can't speak, they just shut up
KRS on the come up, liftin Big Pun up. Let me sum up
Dope MCs, wack MCs, thin MCs, fat MCs, commercial MCs
They can't all get done up
Raise the drum up, breath for breath, I'll rip your lung up
On my trophy wall, I'm nailing your tongue up

We gotta start trusting each other right now if we gonna make it
Through this night
From Criminal Minded to Spiritual Minded, and even beyond and behind it, never be afraid to fight
Or be the lazy type. Me, I'm the crazy type
I get them clubs so crazy hype
I throw them glasses on that them ladies like
And years later, rock what they babies like
I blaze the light, there me be 8,000,000 ways to die
But there's 16,000,000 ways to fight
So wherever you are,in the crib or your car, in your tank too
KRS-One would like to thank you, right
That's why KRS on the mic
Wishin you peace for the rest of the night

Taking you low...

This The Teacha, I do this for life
Plus I'm psychic, but I ain't gon tell you who's doing your wife
You ain't raw like the coke in your rhyme recital
You been cut so much, you starting to look suicidal
You trifle, trifling, you need to stop and listen
You need to hear 2Pac when he was locked in prison
Man, for real, I'm expanding
This ain't whiling out, you'll get nicked with two cannons
Your team's not loyal, you're not harming me son
If I said ""Who wanna go on tour?"" you'd be an army of one
What's that shit around your mouth man, cum?!
Face the fact, you lost, we got it, we won
You better off trying on some lottery run
Then to go against The Teacha, I put the Glock to you dunn
I be rockin' them drums, all you doing is shoutin'
What's your address, 69 Brokeback Mountain?!
It seems my skill you doubtin'
I spit lyrics, I flow like a fountain
Listen, you'll get crushed like a kush going into my blunt
I take it way back, all you do is front!

Yeah... haha, ha...
Yeah, yeah... KRS!

Spit-tacular, you spit at me, I spit it back at ya
I'm an emcee, not an actor
My lyrics won't trap ya, they'll free ya
But rappers still wanna test The Teacha, let 'em have it!
What you in my face for, in my space for?
This is what you rappers get smacked in your face for
Y'all talk about cutting the bass raw
But you draw the cops, this what you get chased for
I'm forever above your world in whatever you do
Rappers, I will level your crew
When I'm through, they won't even be able to TELL if it's you
I'm an emcee, this tradition goes back to Pebbly Poo
Man, I speak the truth, I'mma show you what God is
I heard your CD; from the start, it was GARBAGE!

Today is a beginning, for you to start winning
You cannot walk around town like you a idiot
Livin it with some Boyz N Tha Hood is your affiliate
That's simply ignorant, really that's the enemy
Train your brain to attain your identity
Self construction not Self Destruction
If you're tryin to be a gangster, you're buggin
If you're not movin ahead yo, you're buggin
You gotta look at yourself, and try to change somethin, huh

Instead wake up the knowledge in your own head
With new ideas you got fewer fears
And with fewer fears, you can get paid in it for years
Yo, take a look around where you at
If you think it's wack, educate yourself and change that (wack!)
I'm fallin down and I can't get up I ain't buyin it
Change the way you think, you'll change your environment
We weren't always slaves or livin in caves
This is what we learned, so this is how we now behave
You can get new ideas by lookin ALL around
Read lessons, ask questions on what is goin down (yeah)

Now it's on your mind, behind your eyes
You can't vote, you can't see it, you can't believe it

Duty,Now Hear This,2015.0,"Duty is called, I'm leaving you once more
I will be back, right back when I'm off from the tour
The tour is your
Duty is called for the raw and the raw one is me
It's me you see
All of them told me ""Kris you're to old b""
When they step to the mic
None of them could hold me

Rhymes never running out, you know what KRS about
I'm all up in the game like Jordan when his tounge is out
The streets is mine these youngins busting is buggin out
You don't see no stars when the sun is out I'm coming out
Who you think the sun round here?
All that soft thug pop shit know but don't get done round here
I'm only making my uniqueness kris-style clear
So your head, I don't have to put a missile there
I do preach peace tho, I am hip hop
But when the Glock pops your brain goes into a dropbox
I keep the crowd jumping like hopscotch in the party
I'm the dopest emcee and im dressed like anybody
I show up, wanna fight, unshaven naughty
Battle a platinum rapper and take his Bugatti
Sell it in the hood, provide for everybody
Next week another rapper giving up a Ferrari


What they call dope today is wack, I'm sorry
I'm raw, sushi style I spit the wasabi
I'm at the corner store, gas station shopping
Go ""where these other rappers really be at I don't know""
But everywhere our crews at people want the boom bap
Boom bap and we ain't taking nothing from no new cats
But KRS-One I come from where your shoes at
Where your soul at, this that real street new jack
Who's that, the masta with the blasta
I dont write song for cash, I write songs that last
They call me the teache cuz I'm from a different class
I preserve hip hop
These the the two kings, these are the greatest
These youngers claiming king and ain't even made this
When the true king touchdown you know it

Tony Touch why'all rock on
Kid Capri yeah rock on
DJ Kenny Coffin yo rock on

In 199-sess, KRS is in his peak-in
You are weak-in and collapse like Mike, collect the beacon
You talk more ish than a cellullar
You can't last, just call me Enema
'cause I give that ass-troid, heaven and mergatroid
I'm that six, umm, microphone-holdin humanoid
Pyschological like Sigmund Freud
But I get annoyed 'cause these rappers have no brain
These hardcore rappers crack me up like cocaine
They got no skill or game
They sellin that commercial let me say it
""Ask for Minoxadil with Rogaine""
True skills I will explain
The teacher breaks this whole shit down plain

West Coast beef must dead, no-ho-ho
East Coast beef must dead, no-ho-ho
Time for us to move ahead, no-ho-ho
Be -boy hip-hop is dead, no
We must move ahead (x8)

People always say when they see us, teach us
So we move by the inch, teachin only some of it, believe us
Hustlas and players and hoes will never leave us
They been around since Mary Magdalene and Jesus
Run wit it, pimps and players run the government
We been raised on a tonne of it that's why we're lovin it
Bein a player is cool when you a kid
Until you get sent up for a eight year bid
Now you use and abuse and serve like hell
Til one day you are found face down upon the ground
Two shots to the dome, we need to switch quick
Dyin over what you players, I think, call a bitch
I'm not a player hater 'cause I hate no one
But when you start destroyin hip-hop, you gots ta go, son
Government attack one who's brainwashed
Government attack two who is, yes, brain rinsed
Government attack three is for you and me
To constantly dream about the Lex with bulletproof tints
It's pointless to think I'm knockin ya
If you a pimp, be a pimp, I'll be a philosopher
So the....


Why-yes are the intelligent, we descend on every establishment
In the East or West, microphone grabbin it
Chess-to-chess, lyrical confrontation is dope
For the hip-hop nation, yet our hope, your scope
Is broader than who can kill who and who got the biggest crew?
That's why black people cannot seem to break through
It's like crabs in a pot when one crab reaches the top
Other crabs wish to pull down and blood (BLOODS)
I'm not understandin what's all the fuss
Hip-hop belongs to all of us
The East created it, the West decorated it
Learn the lesson, the unified picture is black expression
When black expression heights itself
It becomes black digression leadin to depression in health
Now question these ideas today
If hip-hop was destroyed could we blame the CIA
Or the FBI, you'd be a motherfuckin lie-
-er, li-are, pants on fire-er
Conspiracy theories are contrise or we keep them on the shelf
We got no one to blame but ourselves
So....

We must move ahead (x8)

My show medley is deadly
I'm about a hundred million mic years away
These players I don't hate, but I'm not here to play
I hit it all day, all night, all afternoon
Rock all mics from the days of sassoon
Where the hell was you? On the corner with rats
When we was at the LQ, lockin it down and that was that

KRS One

Listen to the stile awhile the KRS is giving you
I'm still repping, that's a miracle
Me, I went from criminal all the way to spiritual
Now the people say ''yo, KRS, there's no comparing you''
Original, down to my DNA, I'm lyrical
From the golden age hip hop is what I spit at you
I am the pinnacle, my level is so critical
Way before the metrics KRS was metaphysical
You gotta look at the fact that I still rap
Hip hop culture, I live that cause I built that
Others are still trapped, they're looking like field rats
Using real raps to see where their next meals at
If they would only feel rap and not deal rap
Their whole style, man, they wouldn't have to steal that
I stay fresh cause I'm hip hop, blessed cause I'm hip hop
Cops wanna stress cause I'm hip hop
Fuck a desk and a lunch break, cutting through that red tape
Temple of hip hop, that's the escape
No cure for the headaches and the failures
I'm on that rastaman vibrations like Bob and the wailers
I teach my kids to be sailors
Cause the sea levels rising, you gonna see technical failures
How many times I gotta say it?
The dream of Dr. King, uh uh, nope, I won't betray it
I'd rather make one righteous dollar on my level
Than make a million dollars spitting rhymes for the devil
We're not coming here to dance, me come to MC
Many say I'm the greatest like Muhammad Ali
Some say I'm arrogant and egotistical and cocky
Cause when I flow they know they can't stop me
So here's another classic, blast it like a shotty
My recoil kick so hard it bumps your body
Me I'm the last of the dreaddy, the knotty
KRS One, I liven up any party
Me getting booed? Chewed? Screwed? Hardly

Which means they new to the tracks
Which means they do hold us back

But only three are ever seen
What happens to the other 17?

They can't see today how they effect tomorrow
Too afraid to follow, cause they trust is hollow
Because according to the laws they'll harp some sorrow

Why you preach so much?  Why you speak and such?
Why you so bent on reachin each of us?""
I reply - because you eatin with us
In the future our children will be meetin with us
Have a seat then with us and start speakin with us
They'll be critiquin us to be sure they believe in us
We don't need a PROBLEM..
PROBLEM IN HIP-HOP TODAY!
We gotta fix it
We live non-toxic, we teach that hip-hop is
The transformation of all subjects and objects
Retrain your optics, to reinterpret the topics
We gotta stop treatin hip-hop like a product
And more of a strategy; I got graphs, charts
Sacred textbooks, these cats can't battle me
But they try, and why?  Cause that's a PROBLEM..
PROBLEM IN HIP-HOP TODAY!
We gotta fix that
These cats need history to get with me
But hip-hop's history's a mystery
So how they gonna find out, trial and error
We can make one the example for all to get better
Inform, KRS is not the norm
I go from hot to warm to cold to hot

Three single syllable words per second
Like I am God, you are God, we are God, forget it
Time to sell it in a lyrical battle, I'll never jet it
Like a shot to ya head I'm embedded in your mind
With constant conscience lyrical rhyme
At the end of time, I'll be in my prime
Re-designin', rhymin'
Like an oratorical Shaman
I look still but I'm climbin
Newsflash here's the latest findin
Ya whole environment created in ya mind and in ya heart
Hip-hop displays art
The highest level of mental expression, play your part
Hook:
I'm the intelligent wise on the mic (x3)
Everybody knows
All these motherfuckers tryin to be large
With their two car garage dressing like El DeBarge
It's played out, fadin out, over
Talk to ya broker, time to give back that Range Rover, soldier!
I told ya woe onto the hip-hop perpetrator
Posin' like a neighbour stealin all ya flavor
Danger danger ya better rearrange ya thinkin
Check what you eatin and drinkin, ya breath is stinkin
With the stench of a snitch with information, leakin
Linkin up with the enemies of Kris speakin
But I'm already in 1999
Feelin fine while most MCs will be out of sight and outta mind
Rewind cos I got a little bit of time
Negativity will be wiped out by paint after turpentine
I find my rhymes combines mobility, creativity
Positivity, productivity, sensibility
To a wide vicinity, engulfin your facility
Oh silly me, you killin me I begin to see your stupidity
I rock way hard you can't get wit me
Or go wit me or flow wit me
Frankly, this is grown people poetry
Forget your little off-the-head rhyme
It's way past your bedtime, for the tenth time
Forget tryin to get mine
I went from the park with my arc in the dark
A simple spark, the little Park sparked now I'm in ya heart
Everytime you think I'm comin one way, I come another way
If you ain't got no fly rhymes, say today
Run away, run away, run away....little boy
Like the TAT crew I terrorize all toys
Noise is what I hear
When you shout your rhyme into the atmosphere
The blast master's here!
Hook (x2)
Now which motherfucker wants their title tooken, defended
I see my schedule it's open-ended
I can move somethin around like ya booty ass sound, beginner
What happened? You couldn't be an Apollo Amateur Night winner?
Now the teacher you reach for
Don't you know I am that lyrical gate keeper
You'll get ran like sneaker
No peep tha, no peep mine, no peep this hard style
That keeps the party floatin like a fetus, meanwhile
You hold your head, you can't belive this godchild
Presented recommend ya and because you're not fertile
Or fertile {pronounced ""fertil""}
Your reflex's slow like a turtle
Yeah my picture you circle from papers and journals
Without rehearsal, I disperse til it's the worst
I verse, I burst sua
Into a million children
In Tiananmen buildings
Willing and start illing, comin thru the ceiling
Enough of this rhetoric let's start building",https://genius.com/Krs-one-high-school-rock-lyrics
Survivin’,Kristyles,2003," Yeah, all my fathers
 That survive, gotta ride to break the illusion, confusion
 Uh.. uh, word
 Keep on fightin, strivin
 Uh.. hold your head up!
 Survivin, survivin
 That survive, gotta ride to break the illusion, confusion
 Keep on fightin, strivin, survivin, survivin

Yo, time to do what we gotta do
These days, livin ain't true, but I ain't mad at you
I don't got time for the stress and the nonsense
So I try to stay blessed, but it's all tense
When I awake, feel the sun on my right side
It make me wanna grab a gun and change my lifestyle
But it only goes so far, so live it up
Or realize what you know star, and give it up
Or either switch it up, gotta keep reppin on
And lookin out for our kids, like the rest of em'
Now I know how it is, and what you're handin me
So I can calculate the right moves for my family, yo
 That survive, gotta ride to break the illusion, confusion
 Keep on!
 Keep on fightin, strivin
 C'mon, c'mon!
 Survivin, survivin
 C'mon, that's right
 That survive, gotta ride to break the illusion, confusion
 Keep on fightin, strivin
 Word up!
 Survivin, survivin

C'mon, let's do this
When it comes to the cash, we ain't equal
Rich man, poor man, poverty defeats you
Where my people? Yo, Kris see you
There's only one of you, that's why you gotta be you
Them others be see-through, flashin and flossin
Me I'm with Inebriated Beats in Boston
Strivin, survivin, we get cash often
But do you really know what daycare be costin?
All my fathers, all my mothers
All my sisters, all my brothers
Hold your head up and teach them younger cats
It ain't where you're from, it's where you're at!
 That survive, gotta ride to break the illusion, confusion
 Keep on fightin, strivin, survivin, survivin
 That survive, gotta ride to break the illusion, confusion
 Keep on fightin, strivin, survivin, survivin

Now see I'm livin just to die without most any reason
So I keep on chasin paper 'til it's time to go
But should I really go for mine and put the clip all in the 9
Or stay at the 9 to 5 a day I just don't know
But a brother got a daughter I gotta support her
Caught up in a system that's outta order, man I can't afford
A kitted Escalade, or bling bling
And so I gotta keep survivin, is the song that I keep singin
I try to keep my head off the floor, the country's goin to war
While Bush is givin dough to NASA and ain't feedin the poor
But I keep love over these beats, these beats keep me alive
Alive, I got to stay the Priest, I will survive y'all
 That survive, gotta ride to break the illusion, confusion
 Uh, word
 Keep on fightin, strivin, survivin, survivin
 C'mon, c'mon.. SURVIVIN
 That survive, gotta ride to break the illusion, confusion
 Uhh! Keep your head up, word!
 Keep on fightin, strivin, survivin, survivin
 C'mon, uhh.. SURVIVIN
 That survive, gotta ride to break the illusion, confusion
 Uh
 Keep on fightin, strivin, survivin, survivin
 Word! Uh-huh
 That survive, gotta ride to break the illusion, confusion

Who do you oppress? .. Uhh!

When every day they cuttin 'em down 'fore they even pop up
When every day you gotta duck 'fore you get shot up

Winnin in, sinnin in, let us begin again
Churches are ran like corporations makin me holla
Corporations are ran like churches praisin the dollar
There's no way out, or is it?  Release your doubt and live it
Teachin metaphysics don't listen to these critics hear it
What kinda world are we livin in?
Believe in yourself, achieve for yourself, see for yourself
Speak for yourself, never weaken yourself, by deceivin yourself
Believe in your wealth, c'mon!


Yo, yo, yeah
What kinda world are we livin out, we move about
In fear and doubt, tryin to get more clout
Just check it check it out, we took the wrong route
To a morality drought, basically I'm callin 'em out
What kinda world are we livin in, when a song
Will not get on, unless it talks 'bout thongs
Now where did we go wrong?  We don't have long
Preference all torn all worn not norm and all gone
What kinda world do we live around, when we lay around
Let me break it down, they shuttin us down
While we play around, we fallin, stallin
While God's callin, all in to fall in

Krush Them,The Sneak Attack,2001,"We crush, them, and they click
Let me tell you right now what you supposed to get
You supposed to get free and intelligent
Not a platinum plaque, that's irrelevant
We CRUSH, THEM, and they crew
Let me tell you right now what you supposed to do
While they floss with the chi-ching and all the rings
You stay focused, keep doin your thing
You cannot get the diamond ring, if you can't really sing
Or if you haven't got a skill, that you ready to fling
What you bringin to the table if you not really able
Tryin to get to the top, like the Tower of Babel
Back in the days, remember all the old gold cables
Where they at now?  Sold, when they dropped from the label
All the money they gave you made you very unstable
They really enslaved but you wasn't able with the coke in your nasal
To see, you up in the crib but they rockin your cradle
You a joke and you fatal, they made you an M.C
Meaning: Most Confused
Not E-M-C-E-E, that's what I use
Many people really wanna know from me
When I'mma drop and they can go cop, the next LP
Or CD, or T-A-P-E you see
It's about word of mouth, for me
We crush, them, and they click
Let me tell you right now what you supposed to get
You supposed to get free and intelligent
Not a platinum plaque, that's irrelevant
We CRUSH, THEM, and they rap
Yo, they don't really know where the money is at
And what's funny is that, is if you'd just stay focused
They'd be the one to be the brokest!
I'm from the inner city, that's right
Flashy asses and titties that's right
No pity mad graffiti that's right
Broken gang treaties, that's real
I speak complete broken slang freely at will
I spit what I'm about to spit, get what I'm about to get
Never no counterfeit, movin about a bit
Knowledge Reigns Supreme, only a few like the sound of it
Others can't get down with it (ONE.. TWO.. THREE.. BREAK!)
So why did I have to come off my sabbatical?
Battle you?  My metachromatical will splatter you
I got another track to do, I can't mack witchu
Your rhymes are fictional, mine are factual
I'll embarass you, I'm glad to do
I'm the teacher but in the streets it can be bad for you
I feel sad for you, cause you frontin like you gettin ahead
But you really on E instead
I've come to show these people you're not my equal
All you want is the cash and a ho in a see-through

You know how we do
We crush, them, and they click
Let me tell you right now what you supposed to get
You supposed to get free and intelligent
Not a platinum plaque, that's irrelevant
Yo we crush them, and they squad
Let me tell you right now that it's all about God
You can walk around the streets like you livin it hard
But a real teacher know when you scarred
I refuse to be bought, I refuse to snooze
I refuse to come up short, I refuse to lose
I refuse to be caught in the court
I refuse to refuse bein taught, I refuse evil thoughts
Cause they whole {shit's} wack, trap's wack
You're wack, you're pack's wack, in fact I jab-slap that
Cap at that, now, retract that crap, wherever I'm in or at
You better go back and sip that crap
Bring your gat, I'm lovin that

If you a woman, you'll get respect

This what we live for!
Let it rock, let it

We can all be hear rockin 'til the mor-ning
Boom, bap, and rap is what I bring
We love, the clubs and we rock them
Yes all over the world we shock them
Cause everybody knows this flow
It blows your mind

We used to step inna de club with these murderers
Hustlers, thugs, pimps and burglars
You ain't gettin in the spot if they ain't heard of ya
And if you sneak in the spot they might murder ya
I used to be in them spots just servin the
Raw rhymes flows and yes earnin the
The respect from the streets in a circular
Over the years, an MC I turned into


Ladies and gentlemen, the most controversial
MC in hip-hop is about to raise your adrenaline
Settle in and grab a seat, they start meddlin I'mma grab the heat
I already grabbed the streets
KRS, you don't find me on your radio station
You find me chillin on them Indian reservations
I spit like cajun spice
You don't know KRS? Your momma must notta raised you right
Man I blazed your type, done raced your type
Man sit down~! You still on a training bike
I'm the crazy type, you the lazy type

New flow, new style, comin in BOOM BAP
Who now wanna throw down, the crew's wild
One flow - you go, two flows - you outta here
We pros, three flows, buck through your outer gear
Let's raise the fahrenheit on these DJ's we don't like
You know who I'm talkin about, yo they might come on tonight
They never hype, never tight, that's not polite
Am I lyin? No you're quit right
So tonight, I be statin facts, most DJ's are whack
They be holdin back, they NBA - Never Broke a Act
Yo I'm hopin that, new DJ's open rap, bring the focus back
And take the crates from these fakes to the lake and throw 'em OVER that
We lead 'em to freedom or poetically beat 'em up
In conventions like meet 'em, see them, we plan to eat 'em up
I'm bein MC'in seein and agreein that this here cut
DEFINITELY will hit them up, so we sing


I SCREAM on these rappers like directors do actors
Hang with computer hackers on farms and ride tractors
Thug spelled backwards is GUT, drop the H
If you ain't got guts and you callin yourself a thug, you a fake!
Not just the guts to bust off 44 calibre
Cause mad thugs turn bitch when you show that ass algebra
It's like... the vexed look, the sex look
The checks look, cause brothers be, scared of that textbook!
You best look elsewhere, knowledge of self here
Never no welfare, echinicea for health care
Outrappin 'em, slappin 'em, ghetto scholar like Pun, Joey Crack and them
On spraypaint we put fat caps on 'em (WORD)
Up in the yard, we go to hittin it harder
Then return to reprieve as mild-mannered Kris Parker
The exec, signin on checks, approvin budgets
But if you want it, meet me at any club, we can THUG IT


N.O.R.E. goes ""WHAT WHAT,"" Cube goes ""YEH-YEAH!""
Jamaicans go ""BUCK BUCK,"" MC Eiht goes ""GYEAH~!""
Master P goes ""UNGHHH,"" Busta RHymes goes ""YAH YAH""
KRS-One goes ""WOOP WOOP"" like cop cars
Cause I pull over pop stars and arrest they guitars
And sentence them to the turntables, cuttin on 8 bars
Shakin 'em up, rippin 'em down, brother whattup? Gimme a pound
You diggin the sound I'm bringin around, shakin the ground, never a clown
You know that you buggin, but you also know that you love it
Somethin new and bumpin others be frontin
They can't even think about, new flows and techniques
They speak when the check speaks but KRS-One is direct heat
 with ad libs

When I say ""Stop the Violence"", what do I mean?
I mean stop with the ignorance of you dumb ass teens
My lyrics are tighter than a hipster's jeans
I got that Malcolm X flow, by any means
Rip any teen
I spit chunky bars
How you hang with me, spitting monkey bars?
When I woo my Tang, I toast the place
My method man, will ghost your face
(Get down)
I hold my space
You rappers capping blanks
That’s why you’re getting Chased like Manhattan Bank
This isn't even my peak
I'm on half a tank
For your whole rap career, for me you have to thank
I'm an old school writer, out for fame
I be in DJ's mugs, like House of Pain
Y'all rappers' is lame
You're not violent
Cuz corporate tyrants are playing you clowns like clients


I spit yesterday and I spit today
I leave rappers on the side of the road like triple A
When I triple my A's like ""Ay, Ay, Ay""
I be in more hoods than the KKK
RS-One, you can see I ain't done
I ain't in, cuz frankly, I ain't them
This word I bring, will burn your thing like Burger King
I'm not the police but you felt the sting
Yes, I helped to bring back the art
Cuz your CD and garbage, I can't tell them apart
Me, I had a hell of a start
I don't hustle my flow to my people
And start calling it art
You rappers are all in the dark
Rapping about money when the world economy is just falling apart
I never was about some chart position
And they not either
You better listen up to this teacher

For Example,D.I.G.I.T.A.L.,1993,"Here's another example of the KRS-One (BO!)
Here's another example of the KRS-One (BO!)
They wish to battle BDP but they cannot
They must be on the jock of WHO? (DJ Scott LaRock!)

Yeah, one-two, what? What?
Grab any tape that you think is hard
Put it in your tape deck and press record
Get this - what's a real hip-hop emcee?
Is it MTV? Is it BET?
Is it five M-I-C's so the people can see?
I mean, how you think you free when you act like property?
Tell me, how can you judge an MC when he's rockin
I mean, rockin it live, not pickin his cotton
I mean, adjustin his clothes I mean, how do you know
Before you come to the show, and you're not gettin cheated
That you're not gettin heated, that you ain't come to the club
Thinkin, ""Uh-uh - I must have been weeded!""
You got to be a educated consumer
Spend your money on MC's cause these rappers'll do ya
All they want is your cash, ass, glass, gas and a flick
When you ask for that autograph, they ass dash quick
Beware of the rapper, he talks like it don't matter
He pulls his gat while we BUST OFF the gatler
He's more of an actor, someone, into theater
Not an upright MC with styles who speaks clearer!


MC's have no time for the bar
Unless we politickin a tape to some drunk A&R
We grab the mic and say who we are, KRS
And start takin it to the chest of the best
This is not a test or a demo
This is when you let go of the limo, like many can't do
They may wanna amp you and chant new, record sellin
But movin the crowd is somethin that they can't do!


C'mon!
You got to be mistaken, I am not your boy
You fake what you creatin, playin wit'cha toys
G'wan with all that bullshit bout you bringin noise
Time for somethin more than PO-PO-POI-POI
All of hip-hop ain't seventeen
Some of us still go back to ""Microphone Fiend""
Back when it was just MC's and DJ's
No video that come on and just replay


Uhhh... uh-huh, uh-huh uh-huh
We can never stop, forever we rock, take a listen
The t'cha is back, cause rap's whack when I'm missin
Me, I would never want the future to believe
That when they trust to look back on us there was no dope MC's
There was, all these rappers grabbin more and more money
And now that I'm A&R they look more and more funny
They rap for platinum plaques without buildin
A cultural strategy worthy of our children!",https://genius.com/Krs-one-for-example-lyrics

Look! Look at him, look at them, look at her
What's about to occur, is what you prefer to occur
While these other rappers sloppily slur
KRS-ONE inspires you to be a street entrepreneur

Organize frequencies that advance spirits
So try not to make the mistake again
Of hanging with fakes again
Then comparing them to the ones that created them

Unless its to that little kid being held by Holy Mother Mary
I'm a whole different kind of scary
Bring your military, I'll smash you and all your subsidiaries, (forever)

I'm talkin to the little you but, there is a bigger you
The bigger you is spiritual, little you that is physical
KRS is givin you, somethin more than I get with you
I'm hittin you, splittin you, rippin you down with me
You busted that metaphysical rap, at the pinnacle I'm at
I'm down here just to deal witchu cats
I never bleep you, I just remind you that they don't need you
They gonna keep you for as long as they can eat you
But that mic you speak through goes from here to Mogadishu
And how you represent US is the issue
I'm not here to diss you, or dismiss you
But at any moment we can be hit with missiles


How many MC's must get dissed
How many young men must get frisked
How much ice can really go on one wrist
How many shots get fired at a target and just miss
We gonna live like this?
I walk the same path that Ma$e do
But he went in the church, I stayed out to face you
The difference between us is not just man to man
But in fact it's fan to fan
People that buy KRS-One goin places
People that buy your shit, they catchin cases
My people eat, your people cheat
Such is the words you speak and you reap

They fear y'all they hear y'all they hate y'all
Less than 40,000 a week, they make y'all
Cops y'all with black feet, livin from week to week
Walk crooked beats in the streets y'all
They greet y'all with the heat y'all, to defeat y'all
It's deep y'all, hear what I teach y'all, and speak y'all

Hate - don't mess with that
Trends - don't mess with that
? - don't mess with that
Revenge - don't mess with that
Truth - yeah, mess with that
Skills - yeah, mess with that
Proof - yeah, mess with that

Wars - don't mess with that
Freaking - don't mess with that
Whores - don't mess with that
Cheating - don't mess with that
G.E.D. - mess with that
Science of mind - mess with that
Family - mess with that
Hip-Hop - we lovin that

Yeah, yo.. aiyyo, yo
Who seein us, with an overdose level of free in us
They bring the heat to us
They don't really want the beat in us
Take heed to us
While they plottin and schemin to be deletin us
Best believe in us, they not defeatin us
Them Glocks wanna bust
With twenty-one shots to put the leak in us
So they can bloody the street with us
What does it mean to us
You know what they need from us
Give cream to us, hide the lies and deceit from us
That doesn't equal us
Who's ready to get in the Jeep with us
Form a fleet with us and take back the street with us
Meet with us, drop bombs in the street with us
Never saw it comin, attack on the sneak with us
Thus, they can't compete with us
We flow through your veins like DJ's
When they cut, you'll be bleedin us
I came with Kris to heat it up
Showin my body's the temple, hip-hop is the lock
Now put the key in us


Truth y'all, facts y'all, proof y'all, black y'all
Time to check this map y'all, are we goin back y'all?
Let's make a pact y'all, come together watch your back y'all
Stay in tact y'all, never whack - gimme dap y'all
Comin at y'all, headcrack y'all with the facts y'all
Police y'all, on the attack y'all if ya black y'all
So if this is fact y'all, when we rap y'all
Over the track y'all, why we rap about crack y'all?
That's whack y'all, we trapped y'all
Holdin the gat y'all just to kill another black y'all
Clak clak clak y'all, it's like that y'all

The I,Keep Right,2004,"Where shall we land, there?
Which city shall we destroy today?
This one, or that one?  This one?

Take a look a look around, we last forever
We carry books around, manuals are bound in leather
We rock the center, the only point that's in the circle
We free MC's, what we decree will not desert you
We know what we doin, we wise and we chillin
We calculate against the continued cries of our children
They may be cryin now but they won't be cryin later
We love hip-hop, because WE are it's creators
So we, build the Temple, write the books, teach the classes
Create instrumentals, write hooks and rock masses
NONE passes, without studyin this flow
It's all good as long as you know Kris know!

While I deal with I, Jah talk to I
When I dem go alike, only de one comply
Whatchu see with de I, look twice toward de I
If you don't unify your children them a gon' cry

I stand with the rejected, the unsuspected, the unconnected
The neglected the one you, never suspected
It seems you forget hip-hop plays the back
Sayin that's my sound, and that's my sound
And that's my track, and that's my rap
And that's some chorus they did way back, look honey bringin it back
I'm actually, I'm everywhere at every time
Animating every rhyme and every dare in every mind
KRS is my representative on Earth
Challenge him not, he's been hip-hop since birth
His main objective, is to put hip-hop in perspective
Show pity, and DESTROY these wack cities


Inna style dem a {?}, yo alla dem a cry
Dey worship slackness and to be under sky
We lead dem to de water but we cyan't make dem drink
Pussy to take a sip, cause it gon' make you t'ink
We don't usually {?} shit {?}, yo alla dem a sing
Wisdom wort more den any diamond and gold
People use it and find it like de Dead Sea Scrolls
 Take dem Lion, take 'em, take it over!

Cause of dem outer, dem outer, dem outer inter outer inter
Outer inter outer inter out of control
Dey neva find wisdom til dem dead ohhh
Mad Lion make de {?} roll
KRS make up a sea and bulge ya
Of the story of never been told-a
Cause we outer, outer, inter outer outer ese
Out of control, out of control
I'm so serious ay (what?)
We don have no time fi play, ay (tell 'em again)
Some people diss dem {?} hell's in this world
But dey'll come around one day

Yo, yo, only Beezlebub think my voice is aggravatin
Children of light hear my voice and start congregatin
The mind's debatin, is he a prophet or is he Satan?
But the tree is only known by it's fruit, what am I creating?
What am I stating?  Have I stood the test of time?
Or am I fading, or has God blessed my rhyme?

Let's go, let's start the show
Contracts and dough, you came to hear Kris
Let's go, let's start the show
Watch how I flow, you came to feel this
Let's go, live MC rappin
Cut mix and scratchin, you came to see me
Let's go, let's make it happen
For your satisfaction, you came to be free

From all the bull, from all the push, from all the pull
From all the critics and the cynics that there happens to be
Relax from the attacks, there's no battlin me
Write whatever you like, I will rattle you G
No hassle for me, with the freestyle skill
Believe I'm ill, chill, I be surpassin MC's
Ain't too many faster than me man
Neck movin, sweat oozin, schoolin, that's how we jam
I write with a free hand, I write with a purpose
If you bought the CD, thanks for the purchase
If you downloaded the album then COME to the concert
Don't sit in front of the computer 'til your eye hurt
Get up, get out, and join the movement
Hip-Hop culture is more than music
And I'mma prove it, whether freestyle or written
Ax yourself how KRS still spittin


Me and my niggas go to the club with hooded jeans and boots
Fuck a dress code, fuck a tie, fuck your shoes and suits
We rock doo rags to fitteds, and throwback jerseys
Front pockets with cash, paint a wall with a slash
Gettin our drink on, burnin trees, eyes lookin Japanese
Whylin out because the DJ threw on M.O.P
Peepin how the ballers with the gators is hatin
But fuck what they be talkin this is straight from the streets
They got war comin out they mouth but they don't want beef
Cause yo I snatch them outta they ride, click click, surprise
Run your jewels, your shoes, before you make tonight's news
All downs are bet, and I'm playin for keeps
Actin like you gon' scheme, then my man gon' squeeze
Word to the {?} cause I knows you don't want it
You be up in, {?} tear while I be, everywhere

Throw Down,UnKnown,UnKnown,"And the Cold Crush Brothers are here to do a sure shot throw down for their very best friends
Let's do it!

When I say ""how"" then you say ""ho""
And if somebody say ""thug"" then you say so
'Cause there's hell below and you ain't trynna go
So get ready for the throw down
Heads catch wreck and bums get done
B.D.P., Cold Crush, KRS-One
Nowhere to hide, nowhere to run
So get ready for the throw down

Throw down, low down
MCs get thrown down
I mastered the sentence, paragraph, and pronouns
I think you oughta go now
You can't stand the blow of toe to toe now
That you heard all the rap criminals
Skills minimal, despicable
Check out the rhyme originals (Cold Crush!)
Indivisible with justice for all
Before ya learn to walk, you gots to learn to crawl
Before ya learn to crawl, you gots to be born
And before you were born, your folks had to get it on
The point to the matter comin' from the blast master
Is hip-hop culture might be headed for disaster
All these wack rappers don't know the past data
They act like hip-hop history doesn't matter
So when you see KRS-One brace the stage
The difference that you see has to do with my age
Fresh in '74, fresh in '75
Fresh in '76 when MCs rocked live to cassette
Fresh in '77, don't forget
Fresh in '78 on a turntable set
Fresh in '79, fresh in '80
I was Grandmaster G with my man Double T
Fresh in '81, and fresh in '82
With DJ Mad Mike off of Church Avenue
In the BK, Brooklyn Flatbush
In the BK MCs got mushed
I was fresh in '83, '84 and '85
When I moved back to the BX and got live
Fresh in '86, fresh in '87
Fresh in '88 after Scott went to heaven
Fresh in '89, fresh in '90
I'm fresh in '91, '92 and '93
Fresh in '94 and '95, don't be forgetting
Fresh in '96 and fresher in '97
Fresh in '98 and fresh in '99
In the new millennium I'll be arousin' your mind, so

When I say ""how"" then you say ""ho""
And if somebody say ""thug"" then you say so
'Cause there's hell below and you ain't trynna go
So get ready for the throw down
Heads catch wreck and bums get done
B.D.P., Cold Crush, KRS-One
Nowhere to hide, nowhere to run
So get ready for the throw down

What does it take to be a real MC?
It means you can't write rhymes for the TV
'Cause a real MC, whether amateurs or pros
Is an MC that knows how to rock live shows
Another thing, while I sing MC talk
A real MC never diss New York
'Cause if you knew the time while your rhymin', MCin'
You'd know that New York is hip-hop's Garden of Eden
And if this ain't sacred, we never gonna make it
You're dissin' your very own hip-hop tradition
You know why when I grab the mic I'm superior?
'Cause I was at the Roxy and Danceteria
KRS, a product of respect and courtesy
While the rapper is a product of the record company
I'm not braggin' but this is what hip-hop is achievin'
It's becomin' all rap and no MCin'
Still we ain't seein', 'cause still we ain't believin'
The West and the East of hip hop can cease

Hey y'all, yes it's true
The boys in blue got a plan for you
And don't mess with the suits 'cause they do too
So whatcha gonna do (Stop bitin' on my crew)
Try to be the best
Live positive and free from stress
And don't limit yourself to East or West
Who's the very best? (KRS)

I warm up your chest while your bones untangle
The lyrics hit your head then goes down your ankle
I'm saved for rainy days like casseroles
Then rediscovered later like the Dead Sea Scrolls
You wanna get out the ghetto, the projects, and profit
Well first, negativity, you gots to stop it
You can big up the East Coast and the West Coast
But you can't big up no coast when you're ghost
I can see now how the other man stole rock and roll
And guitar rippin', 'cause we was bullshitin'
Sittin', eatin' chicken, what fixes time tickin'
We spittin' and complainin', the world is rearrangin'
Still we doin' the same and who's to blame, we don't need this
It's not black strength, it's black weakness
Now we doin' the same and who's to blame, we don't need this
It's not black strength, it's black weakness

When I say ""how"" then you say ""ho""
And if somebody say ""thug"" then you say so
'Cause there's hell below and you ain't trynna go
So get ready for the throw down
Heads catch wreck and bums get done
B.D.P., Cold Crush, KRS-One
Nowhere to hide, nowhere to run
So get ready for the throw down

Alright With Me,Kristyles,2003,"I've got the illest live show (Now what you sayin?)
I drop the illest rhyme flow (Now what you sayin?)
But you still want to act like you don't know
Well, that's alright with me
People sample me like James Brown (Now what you sayin?)
When they want to hear that (donk-a-donk) sound (Now what you sayin?)
But you still want to put me down
Well, that's alright with me

The Kristyles is officially on blast
Don't worry about what he say, cause he won't last
If you want to learn the way take a seat in this class
I write albums like singles and release them so fast
I get around the whole country on foot like Flash
I don't fly across country I be there with the mass
Drivin, drivin, pulling up to your hood spot
You sayin to your son, ""now this how radio should rock.""
I pray for these radio cats cuz they don't know
How fast I be movin when they be movin slow
This ain't no fast food rap dude, get it and go
This that home cooked type meal, lyrical flow
Spiritual grow, ya know cuz ya was there, fo sho
Like Joey Greck I'm not the average Joe
(Yo, welcome cats to the BDP show
With KRS, Kenny Parker, G Simone, and Chalk-o)


I spit when I speak, when I speak I spit
When I spit what I spat it splits ya clique
Spit, spat, speak, spoke, either way
I spat that your rap's not dope any way
When you spoke I spit that splattered your scope
I split that and spit that unanimous quote
No hope when I battle I'm staggering folk
They slip-sliding away there rappers ain't dope
Get my coat, I make sure you can see shells
For sure you gon' see them cuz all you see is sales
Forget it you ain't wit it, admit it
Every thing you did I already did it


Too many emcees not enough time
Nine out of ten niggas say they wanna rhyme
Four out of nine talk about drugs and crime
Three out of four say they wit it but they not
Two out of five spit fire plus the underground
One out of three spit righteous but they never shine
One out of two claim they ballin all the time
And only one make it to prime
Do that math, only one Biggie, one Pac, one Jay-Z
One Nas, one Fifty, one X, one Slim Shady
One KRS-One, one L, one K, one Busta, one Pun, one Love, only one me
Take that TNT, that spit is my property

Are You Looking At This,Never Forget,2013,"Run, run, run, run...
Will you stay or will you run
When you looking at this

I know you young but are you looking at this
I know you got dumb but are you looking at this
Your day is gonna come when you looking at this
Will you stay or will you run when you looking at this

You cannot see we now free, we get cassette back
So everytime I get the microphone I gotta bless that
Everytime I speak the truth they hopin' you forget that
9/11 truth got proof, you know we rep that
The war was started on a lie - did you forget that?
Politics is all about money and we accept that
Voting is like joking with rights we'll never get back
This a different type of rap of what you might've guessed eh?
Fresh rap - put it on your tongue, man, test that
People always askin' and passin' where KRS at
I be teachin', preachin' and speakin' a little less rap
Educators, straight from the pavement, me nah gon' left that
 x2

Too many rappers talkin' 'bout now they the best at
While KRS-One is at levels they'll never get at
Beat bitin', fakin' the funk - dudes respect that?
All these lies hitting your head, right where you rest at
They take your mind off the truth and put it where the sex at
Now these rappers doing R&B - forget that
In the game I'm bright, I'm skipped twice, they left that
Cash - I don't stress that, the stage is where I'm fresh at
Cats want cars but don't know where East or West at
Steering themselves right into where the stress at
Their own words got 'em sick and right there where the mess at
Talking like demons but wanting God to bless that
Take a minute, step that
Think a minute, digest that
It's not every day a teacher speaks and you get that
Down goes the devil - ra-ta-ta-ta-ta
The American presidency is for sale and you can check that
You think one man, one vote really elects that
News with views? Where's the free press at
Don't let 'em take your mind and put it where the rest at
Edutainers, straight from the pavement, me nah gon' left that",https://genius.com/Krs-one-are-you-looking-at-this-lyrics

Biterz,Now Hear This,2015.0,"We know, yeah it's all in they flow
Yeah it's all in they show
They some bite, bite, bite, bite, biterz

Everybody know KRS-One, he is a writer
Original lyrics and routines
No biting, no biter
Prime reciter
I gets the news because I'm tighter, graffiti writer
But now I'm talking about these biterz
What's a biter?
A biter's unoriginal, a biter's predictable
Skills minimal, yo these dudes are pitiful
They conserts are wack, I don't even try to go to them
They open they mouth and I hear the radio all over them
Remember in them early days when we was coming up
You had to be original, yep with dope lyric and your cut
Every day and every night you had to practice and come up
With the dopest rhymes that'll make a crowd of people say buck-buck
Everybody had they own style, ran they own lane
Everyboday had a profile, ran they own game
Every DJ had his own style, broke his own name
Now it's lame, everything rap was against it became


Listen to they lyrics and they style, you know they biterz
They listening to the radio, then they claim they write it
But it does get deeper, all the wheeling and dealing
When the society we live in, is all about stealing
And these ignorant rapper they bring creativity down
Now one is using they mind, they just scrounging around
So a biter is a unorigianl style stealer
They see you drink tequila, so they wanna drink tequila
You say mommy or poppy, they say mommy or poppy
They really have no original ideas, they just copy
And people walking around, hollow like that
If death was the new sting, they would follow the path
They not led by the inner, they led by the outer
So they led every hour by anybody with power
Be original, be authentic, be you
But every emcee test the mic with a ""one, two""",https://genius.com/Krs-one-biterz-lyrics

Yeah, YEAHHH, yeah... word
For my next number I'd like to bring up a young lady named Courtney Terry
And uh, my name is KRS-One
It's gonna go like this

When the moon is filled with those that died
And you prefer the style of KRS-One
MC's around the planet
Has loved the styles you brung - hit 'em dunn

Feel this, feel it
C'mon! Now get your hands up
Uh, uh, uh, c'mon, c'mon
Yeah, c'mon, yeah, yeah

Open up the door let me come in the place
Before you recognize the raw yo it's right in your face
Just a little taste, yo I'm kind of nuts like Planters
Behave and your save your money cause this album is bananas
I'm flashin just a little style, for a LITTLE while
Been flowin like the Nile from when you was just a child
Now it's '98, and I will NOT hesitate
You be floatin in the lake, you not no heavyweight
You're lightweight, I devestate, on a equal basis
No I'm not a racist but no race could really face this
I hate this - no I don't; you face Kris - no you won't
You know you broke, cause what you wrote, ain't really dope
Like a billygoat, I'll ram your set like BLAOW~!
Who CARES how you like me now, you underground
Boogie Down, let me make one thing clear
BX baby, this is our year
Try here and die here it's too fly here
As I drew my spear near, think what to do my dear
I'm new and clear, my clarity's amazin
Still blazin, play the low on occasion


You know the deal!!
Yeah, c'mon!
Uhh... c'mon, c'mon!

I'm small and not bigger, drink water not liquor
So I smart outquick ya lyric makin move like a ninja
I'm all up in ya like blood
My whole style is devestatin you're renovatin like HUD, what?
You'd expect when I'm on the set don't forget
I'm givin and catchin wreck, you still ain't ready yet
Better yet when I connect ALL Y'ALL HIT THE DECK
Heck, you might as well sign over that publishin check
You ain't worthy, my style is ugly and dirty
If you ain't close to 30 you really haven't heard me
But don't worry, hurry into clubs I get wit 'em
Got styles for the 80's 90's and the new millenium
Only sucker MC's be like ""KRIS DOESN'T SHIT WIT 'EM""
Cause they can't get with him, only the best sit with him
Cops don't be friskin him, gangs be enlistin him
Nations be missin him, you really think you dissin him?!

Their knives can't stick me, it's GOD~! Think quickly

You make me laugh B - battle? Don't gas me
You should ask me to make your style more crafty

Always right when I write like Betty
Boop, together with a ready loop, and many troops
Kickin better letters with extras like veggie soup
Smashin any group or solo

Halftime,I Got Next,1997.0,"Right now as we rockin' they shootin' outside
Now we have got to chill
We have got to chill
We can't have no gunfire because hip-hop can't build
Let's leave all the shootin' and the violence outside
I know there's some people in here, armed to the teeth
But understand
It is the conciousness behind the gun
That determines if the gun is positive or negative
So let's not blame it on no pistols, no guns, no gats
Let's blame it on the conciousness of the mind holding the gat",https://genius.com/Krs-one-halftime-lyrics
I’m Still 1,UnKnown,UnKnown,"D.J. Doc you know he's down with us
D-Square, he's down with us
Keyboard Money Mike, is down with us
I.C.U., you know he's down with us
D-Nice and McBoo, they're down with us
Ms. Melodie, she's down with us
Just-Ice and DMX, they're down with us
My manager Moe, he's down with us
Castle-D boy, he's down with us
D.J. Red Alert, he's down with us
Robocop boy, he's down with us
Makin' funky music is a must
I'm number one
People still takin' rappin' for a joke
A passing hope or a phase with a rope
Sometimes I choke and try to believe
When I get challenged by a million MCs
I try to tell them, ""We're all in this together!""
My album was raw because no-one would ever
Think like I think and do what I do
I stole the show, and then I leave without a clue
What do you think makes up a KRS?
Concisive teaching, or very clear speaking?
Ridiculous bass, aggravating treble
Rebel, renegade, must stay paid
Not by financial aid, but a raid of hits
Causing me to take long trips
I'm the original teacher of this type of style
Rockin' off-beat with a smile
Or smirk or chuckle, yes some are not up to
BDP Posse so I love to
Step in the jam and slam
I'm not Superman, because anybody can
Or should be able to rock off turntables
Grab the mic, plug it in and begin
But here's where the problem starts, no heart
Because of that a lot of groups fell apart
Rap is still an art, and no-one's from the Old School
'cause Rap is still a brand-new tool
I say no-one's from the Old School 'cause Rap on a whole
Isn't even twenty years old
Fifty years down the line, you can start this
'cause we'll be the Old School artists
And even in that time, I'll say a rhyme
A brand-new style, ruthless and wild
Runnin' around spendin' money, havin' fun
'cause even then, I'm still number one

Blastmaster KRS-One of course
Comes to express with style the lost
Ways of rhyming, old and new, past and present
Knock, knock, who is it?
A brand-new style, hup, time to change
People talk about me when they see me on stage
Live in action, guaranteed raw
I hang with the rich and I work for the poor
Now tomorrow you can say you saw
KRS-One stompin' once more
I play by ear, I love to steer
The Alfa Romeo from here to there
I grab the beer, but not in the ride
'cause I'm not stupid, I don't drink and drive
I'm not a beginner, amateur or local
My album is sellin' because of my vocals
You know what you need to learn?
Old School artists don't always burn
You're just another rapper who's had his turn
Now it's my turn, and I am concerned
About idiots posing as kings
What are we here to rule?
I thought we were supposed to sing
And if we oughta sing, then let us begin to teach
Many of you are educated, open your mouth and speak
KRS-One is something like a total renegade
Except I don't steal, I rhyme to get paid
Airplanes flyin', overseas people dyin'
Politicians lyin', I'm tryin'
Not to escape, but hit the problem head-on
By bringin' out the truth in a song
So BDP, short for Boogie Down Productions
Made a little noise 'cause the crew was sayin' somethin'
People have the nerve to take me for a gangster
An ignorant one, something closer to a prankster
Doin' petty crimes, goin' straight to penitentiary
But in a scale of crime that's really elementary
This beat is now compelling me to explain in silence
Why my last jam was so violent
It's simple: BDP will teach reality
No beatin' around the bush, straight up, just like The P Is Free
So now you know, a poet's job is never done
But I'm never overworked, 'cause I'm still number one
Cool Moe Dee, he's down with us
Eric B. and Rakim, they're down with us
Stetsasonic, they're down with us
Dana Dane, he's down with us
Sleeping Bag Records, they're down with us
My lawyer Jay, he's down with us
Jive/RCA is down with us
Makin' funky music is a must
I'm number one",https://genius.com/Krs-one-im-still-1-lyrics
Smilin’ Faces,D.I.G.I.T.A.L.,1993,"Yeah.. aiyyo Kris tell 'em what's up yo

Yo, yo yo, one two!
Comin at you live and direct (that's right)
Digital Underground kid, you know what's up

Aiyyo Kris is chillin, Shock G's chillin
What more can we say, about the village
The real killers, chillin in the Whi.. I mean the not RIGHT house
Want me to be they lab white mouse
The smile of seedy greedies, deprivin the needies, breakin treaties
Overseas wildin while they profilin on the TV's
Some of 'em cool though.. see I like that nigga Bill
Hittin everything in town, and he got that smile down
Now let's break down the meaning of a smile
Is it happiness and blissfulness, well let's go down the list
You got the real deal for real-real smile
You got the phony they don't know me let me hide my feel smile
The dumb embarassed smile
The ooh she look delicious, yo that girl is lavish smile (uh-huh)
Then you got the shake your head nah black, that shit was whack smile
The across the bar, yeah it's cool, we can hit the sack smile
The crack smile, the caught in the act smile
The over my shoulder caught you schemin on me delayed react smile
The smile you're really glad to see when it comes round
The spot's hot, they got you boxed in, it's bout to go down
You glance back, your man who packs that once in a while
Gives you the - oh I'm strapped, do your thing, baby I got your back smile

Smilin faces, sometimes
Pretend, to be your friend
Smilin faces, show no traces
Of the evil, that lurks within

Whaddya think I joke?  Whaddya think I sniff coke?
Me a wild t'ing like Tone Loc, you better be dope
When the soundclash erupt, rev up, step up to the cut
Whassup?  I show up to blow up and leave the spot TO' UP
You know what?  I'ma go nut, but you know what?  Yeah, so what!
It's the regular, when you checkin the, one that perfected the
Smilin faced people posin as your equal
Knowin they wanna beat you defeat you and eat you, but they greet you
With peace and love, not with the piece but the dove
Not beneath but above, now the cheek give a hug
Snug, no grudge, 'til you turn your back and learn the facts
Called learnin truth, the tree is only KNOWN by its fruits
These smilin faces, in many places, sometime they racist
Sometime they sexist, sometime they want your Lexus
Sometime they be your family members remember
Oh no not my lady, oh no not my fella, with them you thought
You'd never ever sever, but they was two-faced - it happens
With a whole 'nother agenda but clever to say whatever forever
Let me make this relationship better, if you real stay real
Be real, the truth we got to treasure, not these

 And they be lurkin
 You know what's up, ha!
 KRS-One, Shock Gigga!
 That's me baby
 HA HA.. word

Yo, just let the beat breathe
Uhh.. yeah..
Cause they be lurkin
Never trust a big butt and a smile baby
Uhh.. keep it goin, ah keep it goin
Yo Kris that's peace baby (uh-huh)
They know the deal
Smile ain't nuttin but an upside down frown (word)
Never trust a big butt and a smile",https://genius.com/Krs-one-smilin-faces-lyrics
It Appears,Never Forget,2013,"Is this thing on?
It's on?
Let me know when you want me to stop

Right foot in the left hand, gospel in the other
Sisters in the front seat, I'm back with my brothers
I can go farther if I'm guided by the mother
Whatever level rappers on, KRS is on another
This that raw Emceein' you don't want none of
Blastmaster KRS-One-uh
Original boom bap beats with just the drummer
Seems like people nowadays is getting dumber
They don't see they're getting older, not younger
So I split the Stevie and make them all wonder
I come with than Donna Donna every summer
They want the high ground, me? I want the under
Rhyme books, rap hooks, I got a ton of them
But here's just one more of them
Now you're about to hear the style of someone who has mastered this
Now it's time to show you what boom-boom-boom-boom-boom bappin' is
This that '86, but from Gecko, we coming back again
Showing you the difference between what MC'ing and rap again
Many have attempted and wrecked it, this very style I spit
Peace to them but you are now hearing the very off the tech
When it comes to music, good music, I'm all on top of it
Criminal Minded, you can find it with Scott LaRock and it
This mix drive, you have to get
You must have forgot what real Hiphop can get
I haven't stole a topic yet, or a beat
I don't get cash every week, I get cash when I speak
I throw it out anywhere, like trash in a street
I spaz on these beats, see the passionate heat
Entrepreneur, I'm not asking to eat
I'm off to Geneva, I'll be back in a week

All through the years, in the end ?

Me stopping with hip-hop
That's like MJ no longer being regarded as the king of pop
You're thinking of the commercial flop could make me stop
20 years in this game, I ain't aiming for the top
I stay up in that underground cozy spot
That in-cognito nobody knows me spot
Most MC's rhyme but don't know their plot
Maxing out their credit 'til their bank closes shut
You went from holding jewels to holding a mop
From talking about, ""Don't snitch,"" now you roll with a cop
It's like you erased your mind and forgot
What the founding fathers truly saw posses ? with Hiphop
We're screaming back to the ? knowledge, culture, and overstanding
While beats are slamming and the people are jamming
Sick of all these talentless hustlers scamming creating mental famine
Don't you think it's time we re-examine?
Let them know what the truth and the facts is
That the game nowadays is manipulated by masonist blue-collared fascists
Marketing schemes is controlling the scene
Fiends for the green, I'm just a man trapped in a machine",https://genius.com/Krs-one-it-appears-lyrics
Things is About to Change,The Mix Tape,2002,"Word.. we stand out, word
We don't wanna sound like that bullshit

Let 'em all be aware, not at all will I care
You gotta know it's about the flow when you comin in here
Not how long is your hair, but how long were you here
How many dues you paid, crews you slayed, yeah
How many clubs you done rocked, f'real
You ever rocked outside with cats poppin they steel?
You fake like Ma-Ma-Ma-Max Headroom
You go from the bedroom to the studio back to the bedroom
We be on the front line, pavin the way
For you to do what you do, get what you get, say what you say
Flip what you flip, play what you play at the Grammy's
But you don't represent our family, you a thief!

THINGS IS ABOUT TO CHANGE

Join the campaign to rearrange the rap game
Don't look at me like I'm insane, the facts remain plain
You to blame, when you take it in vain
The gains and struggles and pains of those that already came
From the beginning we tried to attain, the money and fame
That's not new to the game, it's still the same
But what seems to change is the loyalty
Rappers degrade hip-hop for a royalty
It's all about me and my click and we ballin G
But we fallin, stallin our callin to be free
You can't see, they're gonna judge our poetry
In two-thousand and twenty-three, where will your money be?
Where will your Benz be?  Your friends be?
Your beginnin be?  Your end be?  Gently
You tell me to my face my style you envy
But behind my back you condemn me, you a thief!

All out in Germany, Africa

How important it is to have a plan

All my men that be holdin they house down, true workin
All my men that be holdin they spouse down, for certain!
You spread love when you drivin around town, not jerkin
You a healer, you take away what's hurtin
Cause if a man can't do what a man plans to do, his purpose
Then a man makes plans with empty hands, he's worthless
He can't even understand the plan
What the second or the first is
Let me verse this or reverse this statistic
We gotta think futuristic
Strategic, logistical and even mystical
We need a new ritual
I'm tired of jumpin over buildings
And havin to stop to hold adult hands like children
C'mon, you can do it, c'mon
And when they get paid then they quickly run along
This ain't just another song
This is that fruit that reveals the right from the wrong
It won't be long here, before the storm's here
And real men are gonna have to be strong

4th Quarter - Free Throws,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Yeah, listen to the lyrics
We are the ones prophesized to return
My main concern is for all of you to learn
How to live, yes through the lyrics I give and send my friend
This age is coming to an end
Not the world, but the age is ending
Ending, listen to the astrological message I'm sending
I'm sending, tell em
Truth is truth, whether or not you like me
We are living now in the age of Pisces
When Pisces is over, at the year two thousand
When the Sun of God, changes his house and
Enters the Age of Aquarius
The Sun of God as man is hilarious (okay)
When you think of Jesus, think of the Sun
The flaming Sun, that's where they stole this concept from
Stop believing and read your bible logically
The new testament is really old astrology
Jesus is the son of God no lie
But they might be talking about the Sun up in the sky
The Sun, that hangs on the cross of the zodiac
The zodiac with twelve signs to be exact
Each sign is a house, and you should keep in mind
Each house equals, a period of time
The time, two thousand years and that's a fact
It's called an age or a house in the zodiac
The twelve disciples, are twelve months of reason
The four gospels signify the four seasons
When Jesus fed the multitude with two fishes
It signified the Age of Pisces, not fish or dishes
If you read the bible astrologically it's clearer (no doubt)
The next age will be the age of the water-bearer
It's called the Age of Aquarius (word)
When logic and truth will take care of us
So in this age, of spiritual dignity
You'll see a rise in femininity
And creativity, meshed with masculinity
You got to get with me, this is your true her-story (rrryyy!)

For classes, yo KRS come get up in they asses

What... I say, follow me follow me
With my syllable syllable lyrical criminal
MC threats are minimal to my phsyical they just
Whittle and whittle away, with little and little to say
As they piddle and paddle away, they say OK
But I chop that ass up anyway
What's your handle I got mad MC heads upon a mantle
I got genuine MC skin sandals
I light the mic up like a candle, watch it melt
Cause when I felt lyrics you both are screamin for help
When you hear it, you can't bear it, you can't even wear it
You oughts to just cheer it, go get it spirit!!
As I fa-la-la-la-la, I'm comin with that rara
Rockin mics when you was googoo gaga to your momma
You wanted to battle KRS when you was young you told your poppa
He slapped you in your head and said UHH-UHH
But you didn't heed the warning
Now I'm in the place, now I'm your face
Lookin at your crew but they all broke out
Because they nothin but lace

In any club in the country when you say KRS they say, ""Let him in""
V.I.P. passes for intellectuals with glasses
Ignorant asses get left outside with the masses
Next day we attend classes and gatherings
Shattering, those that be rattling about battling
Battin 'em down from the Bronx like Don Mattingly(?)
The black African snappin backs again and laughin again
You won't be askin again, my album I'm already masterin

Urban inspirational
Holy Hip-hop
You know the type, all in your city
Word up

I know that the dayz ahead are dark
But you can shine the light that's in your heart
You've got-ta see yourself in victory
The love I give to you, you give to me

Let's come together once and for all
Before our children cannot walk in the mall
Before we can not talk or walk at all
Already aviation is stalled
Now everybody wants to drive, bringing our highways to a crawl
Just about three weeks on back
I was talking to a journalist about my album, the Sneak attack
Now I know, why I felt that way
Why the cards God revealed to me was dealt that way
Be prepared for the unexpected, that was the theme
But if your booty's shaking, you can't know what that means
Look, we all, in the, same, game
It's that world bank game that got struck with two flame
But we, yes the people, are struck with true pain
Coz the world Bank'll do the same under a new name
We gotta recognize the prize, and the people at the door
No more lies, you can no longer ignore

I know that the dayz ahead are dark
But you can shine the light that's in your heart
You've got-ta see yourself in victory
The respect I give to you, you give to me
I know that the dayz ahead are dark
But you can shine the light that's in your heart
You've got-ta see yourself in victory
The respect I give to you, you give to me

I know 
I know! 
What do I show? 
Capitvating lyrical flow!

Yeah, but the spirit know
But only a few can hear it though
The metaphysical lyrical blow
The minute you're in it and hear it, yo
See the evil and clear it, yo
See that for as many that died there was twice as many miracles
Uh, So let the dead bury their dead
Life is but a dream, and in the dream we gotta get ready for bed
Better we look ahead instead, to the ones that survived
Pray for them too, coz there grace of God kept them alive
Yes we mourn for the dead and will still kill for them
But what about the injured that must still rebuild again?

I know that the dayz ahead are dark
But you can shine the light that's in your heart
You've got-ta see yourself in victory
The love I give to you, you give to me
I know that the dayz ahead are dark
But you can shine the light that's in your heart
You've got-ta see yourself in victory
The love I give to you, you give to me

To all the people, that never lost someone
Consider the cost of the loss of a lost daughter or son
These cowards slaughter and run
And to know that there's more than just one
Makes you wanna store up your gun
And withdraw all the funds, but

I know that the dayz ahead are dark
But you can shine the light that's in your heart
You've got-ta see yourself in victory
The love I give to you, you give to me
I know that the dayz ahead are dark
But you can shine the light that's in your heart
You've got-ta see yourself in victory
The respect I give to you, you give to me",https://genius.com/Krs-one-dayz-ahead-lyrics

K-R-S, O-N-E, comin back for y'all
I do a little more than videos and rap for y'all
I been in many cars, known by almost every star
New rappers, old rappers, this'll rock for any y'all
The edutainment from the pavement, Kris'll flatten y'all
I'm like a fitted to my enemies, I'm cappin y'all
What happened y'all? Them corporations backin y'all

Look at this, look at this, LOOK~!
Grown men on the TV still jiggy
Still on the television, holdin up they pinkie
Little children lookin at 'em thinkin that it's pretty
But let me introduce you to that gritty inner city
Where the cops be +Kurupt+ like my man from dogtown
If I unite with +Daz+ we could shut 'em all down
Hip-Hop, East West, North South we lovin it
It's time for new leadership, time for self-government
Put a fist up! Every real club we rip up
I spit raw conscious lyrics to lift Kris up
Never give up, see the real O.G.'s know me
But these young'uns be buggin they think they can hold me

I'm not starvin me man, I be feedin me man
You won't be seein me man, cause I be bookin me man
Them lights be hookin me man, while people look at me man
They sing the hooks with me man, yo read this book with me man
How these rappers slash actors wanna fuck with me man
When we be up inside the spot they be duckin me man
I be movin me man, showin and provin me man

I just stay extra focused on the G-O-D in me man
Not too many ahead of me man
If rappers were television channels I'd be C-SPAN, believe me man
Don't nobody sound like me man, I'm a free man
For that golden age hip-hop, you know you gotta see me man
From 1973 man, to 1993 man
If you unaware of them 20 years you won't understand me man
So here's the plan for you and me man
Hip-Hop is not a product to be bought and sold
Hip-Hop is you and me man
So in the years to come you gonna see me man
On top of a Shaquille like Leland
And you gonna be right there with me man

Freedom,Life,UnKnown,"Feel this, a new experience
And your approach to the lyrics
To the beats and the rhymes
KRS

After 19 years of rocking, how do you rank me?
Poorly or greatly? I'm no Johnny-Come-Lately
It's the people that pays me
G-O-D is what raised me
To think that you could blaze me, you must be more than crazy
Radio is Fugazi, XM satellite plays me
Criticism don't faze me, being rich don't amaze me
These princely rappers, they gettin' parked like Paisley
I'm two times the effects like Scoop and Crazy Drazy
I know that no man out there could save me
So I save myself with knowledge of self and  that God gave me
No coulda shoulda or maybe
I'm in 2024 with the adult version of your baby
The path of life is so wavy, you can not be lazy
Or mindless like a ship sailing eternal gravy
Through hip-hop we speak so plainly
So let's unite and sail through life as a navy

It's just another day for me (beats rhymes living a life)
Another day (in these times it's gotta be life)
 freedom (yeah, living)
It's just another day for me (beats rhymes living a life)
The only way (in these times it's gotta be life)
 freedom (yeah, living)

All these people looking at me
Walking with me, staring at me
This is how we work, flash film glaring at me
Little children very happy, I'm signing books CDs
Now I'm signing t-shirts, and yeah my hair stay nappy
Living giving advice on living your life
Oh no, you don't have to be stopped
I'm talking walking working
Inserting energy for certain, not an average person
Temple of hip-hop to hold the over boulder
Money folder for soldier, big up Tony Toker
I don't bridge or poker, not a sauna soaker but come on over
Let's make a plan to get free as we can
Cruisin' the span of this land  in a new range rover
Get out the city my friend, they have no pity my friend
The way we treat each other is silly, my friend
When you consider the millions of men and women and children
We gotta raise the quality of living

It's just another day for me (beats rhymes living a life)
Another day (in these times it's gotta be life)
 freedom (yeah, living)
It's just another day for me (beats rhymes living a life)
The only way (in these times it's gotta be life)
 freedom (yeah, living)

Music don't make me, I make it then make it
Make sense, don't it?
And if it don't, you should spend some more contemplation on it
Moments of time spent honing my rhymes
Sent from only the divine, my purpose is mine
And mine alone to define despite your prospective vision
Or skeptic criticism or messed-up definition
I'm a servant of God, don't ever mistake it
And your fate for all that faking, you can never escape it
I'm faceless and raceless, my message is ageless
I'm within all faces the same like with hatred
The Matrix was fake but how they make it so tight?
It's a Mahalia Jackson, imitations of life

It's just another day for me (beats rhymes living a life)
Another day (in these times it's gotta be life)
 freedom (yeah, living)
It's just another day for me (beats rhymes living a life)
The only way (in these times it's gotta be life)

Watch this (God, you alright)
I'm steppin' in this place like it's all right
I got my partners with me, yep we feelin' all right
I got my woman with me, yup she lookin' all right
When it's time to move I'm never left, I'm all right
Well, I met my man ""What up Duke?"" - ""I'm all right""
He said ""Listen to this"", I said ""All right""
He said ""This strictly confidential"", I said ""All right""

I started liftin' up, felt my spirit driftin' up
What's goin' on? The Jeep is gone and everything's all white

I'm back alive, people askin' ""Are you all right?""

So evil has hold of thy lyric
Whomsoever shall hear it shall adapt it
And walk the talk of evil just as ye rapped it

Evil is an illusion, in GOD we trust
In Satan we lust

My manager moe, he's down with us
Castle-d boy, he's down with us
D.j. red alert, he's down with us
Robocop boy, he's down with us
Makin' funky music is a must
I'm number one
People still takin' rappin' for a joke
A passing hope or a phase with a rope
Sometimes I choke and try to believe
When I get challenged by a million mcs
I try to tell them, we're all in this together
My album was raw because no-one would ever
Think like I think and do what I do
I stole the show, and then I leave without a clue
What do you think makes up a krs?
Concisive teaching, or very clear speaking?
Ridiculous bass, aggravating treble
Rebel, renegade, must stay paid
Not by financial aid, but a raid of hits
Causing me to take long trips
I'm the original teacher of this type of style
Rockin' off-beat with a smile
Or smirk or chuckle, yes some are not up to
Bdp posse so I love to
Step in the jam and slam
I'm not superman, because anybody can
Or should be able to rock off turntables
Grab the mic, plug it in and begin
But here's where the problem starts, no heart
Because of that a lot of groups fell apart
Rap is still an art, and no-one's from the old school
'Cause rap is still a brand-new tool
I say no-one's from the old school 'cause rap on a whole
Isn't even twenty years old
Fifty years down the line, you can start this
'Cause we'll be the old school artists
And even in that time, I'll say a rhyme
A brand-new style, ruthless and wild
Runnin' around spendin' money, havin' fun
'Cause even then, I'm still number one
Blastmaster krs-one of course
Comes to express with style the lost
Ways of rhyming, old and new, past and present
Knock, knock, who is it?
A brand-new style, hup, time to change
People talk about me when they see me on stage
Live in action, guaranteed raw
I hang with the rich and I work for the poor
Now tomorrow you can say you saw
Krs-one stompin' once more
I play by ear, I love to steer
The alfa romeo from here to there
I grab the beer, but not in the ride
'Cause I'm not stupid, I don't drink and drive
I'm not a beginner, amateur or local
My album is sellin' because of my vocals
You know what you need to learn?
Old school artists don't always burn
You're just another rapper who's had his turn
Now it's my turn, and I am concerned
About idiots posing as kings
What are we here to rule?
I thought we were supposed to sing
And if we oughta sing, then let us begin to teach
Many of you are educated, open your mouth and speak
Krs-one is something like a total renegade
Except I don't steal, I rhyme to get paid
Airplanes flyin', overseas people dyin'
Politicians lyin', I'm tryin'
Not to escape, but hit the problem head-on
By bringin' out the truth in a song
So bdp, short for boogie down productions
Made a little noise 'cause the crew was sayin' somethin'
People have the nerve to take me for a gangster
An ignorant one, something closer to a prankster
Doin' petty crimes, goin' straight to penitentiary
But in a scale of crime that's really elementary
This beat is now compelling me to explain in silence
Why my last jam was so violent
It's simple bdp will teach reality
No beatin' around the bush, straight up, just like the p is free
So now you know, a poet's job is never done
But I'm never overworked, 'cause I'm still number one
Kool moe dee, he's down with us
Eric b. and rakim, they're down with us
Stetsasonic, they're down with us

When you get older and you realise you need it
That's when you retrieve it, now class be seated

Wild styles I bring you, now go re-write your single
My last name should be Kringle for the gift
On the drummachine I program songs like Steve Smith

You're not listening, I self-create my position
Any room I enter I transform to a church

-Able to leave sucker MC's in a single rhyme-

Your whole crew jetting they be seriously threating
My lyric weapon be upsetting the jamsession
Gather round now for a very important lesson
KRS-One is not the one you should be testing
No guessing, we follow strict mathematics
Temple tactics and word magic
So step up if you wanna get hurt
All year around our shows be worth
The force I observe lifts up your skirt
Leave your space cabin Captain Kirk covered in dirt
Samples:
-Has more rhymes than a train has tracks-
-Able to leave sucker MC's in a single rhyme- 2x
You got the long lasting, floors matching without asking
Rhymes with a passion, KRS-One, broadcasting
Never crashing cos I'm never speeding
You should be heading, what do you trick and I be reading
Leading the new school, with new rules for new fools
Flash styles and young MC's it makes they crews drool
Some say you cruel when I bust off like a new tool
Making a man you do as I drop two jewels
Positive and negative, mutualist disadditive, but I'm not giving it
The Godess is my relative, knowledge I be living it
I creep with it, come to elect ya and you'll witness it
Lyrics I'll be flicking it
Don't step this way if you begin in it
Push your hands up if you've been in it
Let me now get into it, straight rhymes hit the innercit'
When it splatter they say ""Damn, those rappers""
Switching ya, fixing a glitch in ya
Pulling the bitch in ya out, taking a bum a ridiculour route

WOLF,Back to the L.A.B. (Lyrical Ass Beating),UnKnown,"That's right
Up and down, up and down we go
Beatminerz on the track, I'm conducting the flow
Reverse flow, you get wolf if you didn't know
Either way when I play I'm a beast at the show
Like yeast I will grow, to the East I'mma go
And increase what I know, bring relief to my bro
I keep in the dough, but my feast I don't show
I keep on the low and I reap what I sow
When it's time for the concert I creep in the show
Sometimes I walk in off the street to the show
Grab the microphone, bring the heat to the show
Hip Hop, I teach it if you're seeking to know
The introduction to the course is perceive what you know
When Hip Hop is what you perceive, leave, you can go
Others make rap but they don't need what you know
You a divine speaker, what you need is to grow
Believe me, I know, I see how it go
All the doors are shut till you reaching for dough
But if everything's for sale then he is a ho
And if everything's for sale then she is a ho
I do things freely, I don't believe in the dough

Up and down, up and down we go
Mr. Walt, Evil Dee, KRS on the flow
Any time, any place—rhymes ready to go
Edutainment from the pavement, man you already know
Never starving, we go, never crawling for dough
We that orthodox Hip Hop that all of you know
Man I lived through the ballers, they ain't balling no mo'
The arenas, the theaters ain't calling no mo'
The budgets from the labels ain't falling no mo'
Them big gold cables are pawned at the sto'
Them cats now thinkin', ""Yo, what was it all for?""
Twenty platinum plaques, you still can't tour
All over the radio, you still can't draw
Now listen back to your lyrics, what was that all for?
When you had the opportunity you could've spit it raw
But instead wanted head from the lips of all these whores
Now you fifty-four and you don't spit it no more
Your jams in the clubs, they don't rip it no more
Head in the bed, you don't get it no more
Now you starting to think, ""What I'm livin' for?""
That's when you see KRS is on tour
After a two-hour show, he's spitting one more!

Yo, let me show you what a legend is
I rhyme as KRS; Krazy Rhyme Stylist
You better keep your eye on this, ain't none higher than this
These clubs don't stop hiring Kris
Time for the light to shine
Too many rappers rapping and they even fight for the right to rhyme
I'm nice with mine, I'm precise with mine
As you can see I don't need ice to rhyme
You a biter, I don't even like your kind
The rhyme you spitting now might be mine
Yo, what they doing here if they don't like to rhyme?",https://genius.com/Krs-one-wolf-lyrics
They Are Taking Your Time,Never Forget,2013.0,"Listen to this rhyme, they taking your time
It's like you're in prison when you don't use your mind
Rise up and shine, they taking your time
It's like you're in prison when you don't use your mind
Eleven million people unemployed and I'm one of them
I grew up with the rats and roaches I had fun with them
Fly sneaks' and fine clothes, I had none of them
But when I came to MC rhymes I had a ton of them
People tell me go get a job, I would run from them
I saw the workforce and work was no fun for them
No beach, no melanin, no Sun for them
With slave robbing bosses why would I come under them?
So at 7 am you wake up from sleep
At 7 am I wake up and take a leak
At 7:05 you got slippers on your feet
At 7:07 I'm going right back to sleep
At 7:15 you thinking about today's meeting
At 7:30 am, my friend, I'm still sleeping
At 7:45, your phone start beeping
Old text messages from yesterday's meeting
8 am you leaving it's freezing
You're feeling unworthy trying to get the work before 9:30
9:45 I'm just turning over
9:45 man, you looking over your shoulder
Here comes the boss looking for that folder
And you know within your folder, you didn't meet your quota
Now 11 o'clock's to bone ya', your boss says where's the folder?
And you feel like you a goner
Well, you simply gotta make it up
But 11 o'clock ops KRS just waking up
Linger in the bed to about 11:30
Spit a morning  prayer, I hope heaven heard me
Stand up at about 12 o'clock, you on your lunch break
I'm just eating breakfast vegetarian cupcakes
1 o'clock, you back at your desk, back at the office
Back into stress, your desk is a mess
Listen to this rhyme, they taking your time
It's like you're in prison when you don't use your mind
Rise up and shine, they taking your time
It's like you're in prison when you don't use your mind
You doing your best but your best ain't enough
You wanna do less but less, makes it rough
It's 101 in the public and private sector
Either way I'm giving a conference at 4 pm a lecture
Topic, while I check my other appointments
Cause hip hop is a culture in lifetime employment
See, back in the days,  to avoid getting jerk
We was told to go to college in case rap didn't work
Now today, not to be so hurt
You better know how to rap in case your degree don't work
Man, you better get the lesson, and stop stressing
MC and a DJ and a high paying profession
So if you need to - don't let them deceive you
You ain't got to believe me, it's time you believe you!
Listen to this rhyme, they taking your time
It's like you're in prison when you don't use your mind
Rise up and shine, they taking your time
It's like you're in prison when you don't use your mind",https://genius.com/Krs-one-they-are-taking-your-time-lyrics

But we freed ourselves with the help of Kool Herc, Afrika Bambaataa, and Flash did work
This is the reason we respect these people
Cause when they was doing it, Hip-Hop was illegal
Now we all legal, and heads wanna floss
They forgot hip-hop, and all the lives that was lost

A smidgen to make life-changin decisions, listen
My mission with precision will position our children
By the millions to start buildin our culture for the billions
And trillions of people comin after us
If they doubt, they won't be as fast as us
Cause in our time we kick a new power rhyme
We keep renewin your mind, cause soon you will find
That every single breath that I breathe keeps us conscious
Enough to perceive and achieve if you believe
But oxygen comes from the trees
Without air for four minutes forget it you catchin some Z's
So which is really conscious, us or nature?
Maybe the trees wish to elevate the paper
And maybe this was just the fall
To forget that nature thinks, we doin nothin at all
And this is the way of the world

Like buffalo girls we go 'round the outside

In the forest, the mountains and the hills I reside
You gotta follow the purpose you feel inside

(Homelessness rising up on families!)
So I can try to find my way
(Word up, homelessness!)
And I work (several resumes on e-mail)
And I work (CDs I'm selling my beats)
And I work (part-time at the retail)
And I work (I'm just about to be in the street)
And I work (the cars that I'm driving around)
And I work (will I ever be on my feet again?)
Oh, what we all gon' tell them?
Oh, we telling them this now

Frankly I don't see how
You can't see how you really homeless now
When the emergency hits, who really holds you down?
With the state of the economy and the way that it is
Many men are at the door with they wife and they kids
Saying

Have mercy, Mr. Percy
(4 million people out of work right now!)
Can't find a cent to pay my rent
(Half the youth population out of work right now!)
Give me another day
(Homelessness rising up on families!)
So I can try to find my way (Oh!)
And I work (try to drive a taxi cab)
And I work (enrolled in a technical school)
And I work (my friends, my family for a loan)
And I work (dollar cabs and carpools)
And I work (just another day now)
And I work (I'm getting paid now)
Oh, what we all gon' tell them?
Oh, we telling them this now

Everywhere across the nation
More people are joining the homeless population
From the south to the north to the west to the east
People can't pay their mortgage or their lease
And last but not least, you better hear what I'm saying
So many men are at the door with they kids saying

Have mercy, Mr. Percy
Can't find a cent to pay my rent
(blow blow blow blow blow! Not getting mercy!)
Give me another day
(4 million people out of work right now! You gotta do something!)
So I can try to find my way ( watch this!)

We on the brink of revolution, you let it get too hot
So many people tryin' to hang on and just can not
They must've forgot last night's news spot
Read like a news murder plot starring who got shot
And very uplifting, just who got knocked
Very little giving, everybody's heart is locked
And they call this a civilization
Where I can't even find work with proper employment qualifications
Hip-hop is the name of my nation
Where every day is Saturday and twelve months is vacation
Peace love unity having fun
You can tell by now I'm not the average one

Get choked for the dough, get stabbed for the stash
My actions brash, I rap for grabbing the cash
They search for the blacklist faces
So no need checking your ethnicity on applications
High class for the green
How the fuck I make thirty grand a year with Dukes holding a Master's degree?
It makes no sense so I make those cents
Using my mind and using a nine, break bread
The move not orderly until those political figures meet a nigga over Martin Normandy
'Til then a nigga gon' count his stacks
Shoot craps and crack niggas for countless acts
This a war going on outside no man is safe from
I'm Triuno, some call me a great one
Until Bush knee deep in my community
I'm hustling for mine 'til I get an opportunity

Have mercy, Mr. Percy
Can't find a cent to pay my rent
Give me another day
So I can try to find my way",https://genius.com/Krs-one-mr-percy-lyrics

You don't really need-a, lyrical teacha
When I reach you through the particles and ways of the speaker
What I got to say is positive and negative
You draw whatever energy you need to live, give and take
Build and destroy, life and death
Inhale, exhale, of breath
The point is yes, everything in life is a choice
East and West, wack rapeprs or DJ KRS-One
Dunn I come like the ancients with a drum
Come along you can hum along or run along
Sing a song if you wanna sing a song
This meta-lyrical poet will surely put it on
I don't wear or count of frauds
But I can prophesize by lookin in your eyes
If you're right or wrong, it could be all
It's always the little things that control the big things
Undirected mind waves will bring a string
Of unexpected anything until you cipher
Whether niggative or negative you don't need either
You need to direct your thinkin through your speakin
Prevent the negative from leakin out into the atmosphere
Do I make myself clear? Achieve a major goal this year
But don't ever step here

I know that you don't like
Things that I like
But just because I write
The things that'll take your mind to sky-high
(I write about life, I write about death
I write about strife, I write about stress
I write about the strong and the weak
I write about the hood and the street
I rhyme about my beefs)

Okay, here I go with a flow that be thumping the show
It's the Teacha KRS-One if you didn't know
Man I speak to the streets over beats every week
Forget crime, peace of mind, that's what you seek
Man I'm back with the heat, I keep rapping
Cause when people look at hip-hop today, they be like ""What happened?""
Here's what happened, one side is chilling
The other side, they already sold out their children
They want millions, forget nation building
If this was really the mob, we would've took them out and killed them
But this the Gospel, we fulfil 'em
I'm Hip Hop, I'm good, I'm omni hood, Kris rocks every block
Rise up, the lights up when I'm up
Challengers, you know exactly where you wind up
This the hand that fed you, I don't hate y'all
Some of y'all make me sick, it's more like a ""hetchoo""
I bring life to your dead crew
My real name is love, and love's gonna get you
I got the TEC too, but it ain't about the TEC
It's about whether the owner of the TEC respects you


What you wanna hear bout central booking for?
Hip Hop, that's exactly what you looking for
If you don't represent the name, what you took it for?
I spit rhymes so raw, you need to cook it more
I'm from the Wild Style, Beat Street breaking
Nope, you're not the king, that seat's been taken
You young'ns on some crazy shit
Me, retire? Why dude, I made this shit!
So yo, get to spitting, freestyling or written
The clock is ticking, stroke your kit and you'll get broken and bitten
Ain't no coke in my kitchen
I got that fish, wheat, bread and chicken, y'all leave limping
I put out more cartoons than the Simpsons

I'm a good guy gone berserk
And nobody cares, everyone's smirking
 for me and my girlfriend
 my girlfriend
It's better this way like veterans say
The world just don't deserve him
Final curtain, yeah you heard him
Never hurt that no one will miss me
I did them  but they diss me
Respect never cut the check so I did my dirt tryin' to get filthy
For feeling guilty, choking on two feet of milky
But that's just how Cali build me
Move on with a new song tryin' to make it, will he?
The clever kid never did
I readily weathered it moving the subject and predicate willfully
Doing it skillfully, kept it real but it never made a mil for me
Paid the bills? Yeah right, man it made more
And it wasn't what I came up in the game for
Big Shame became one of my name
Whether money ever coming to me  open the door
But I'm tired of knocking, on my last option
I'm stopping, never got it popping
So it's no longer fun
I got my gun, I'm done",https://genius.com/Krs-one-gimme-da-gun-lyrics

Is Knowledge Reigns Supreme
You got no time to joke and play
Cause Knowledge Reigns Supreme
While others play that game for fame
Their concepts bring you stress and strain
But blessed are those that know my name
Is Knowledge Reigns Supreme

Why do I call myself God when I'm speaking
People always ask me this question when I'm teaching
What you gotta understand is that Kris don't exist
The only existence is God consciousness
In God consciousness is what exists is Kris
Your ego tells you that you doing all this
You a Mister, a Mister professional lyricist
I get rid of this forever, It only gets better
Kris from the universe; you can never sever
Cause there is no Kris, only the universe remember
Go a little deeper you can check me
My whole campaign is about living life correctly
But don't respect me respect the universe
Tt's her verse that I disperse


I'll bring you out the cave
And change how you behave
Everything is really particles and waves
Not to mention your visual extension is ruled by perception
Guiding your every direction
If you really want money your mentality much switch
If you really wanna be rich you gotta act like you're rich
You can't act like a bitch if you wanna be a lady
You can't get the gravy if you're sitting around lazy
You can't be in the hustle if you ain't looking for trouble
You can't be single if you know you're really double
You can do it, yeah
We can do it, yeah
You can do it, yeah
We can do it, yeah
We the best
Don't worry about the cards that they dealt ya'

Every day and night seeing myself rock the mic'
Lyrics tight, getting paid right for my mental sight
Richer not poorer, expanding my aura
To attract more'a positive energy


Uhh, one two my man Kris
Flip the style you do it like this

Hard to forget it
The culture thats inbedded check it
It's energetic
But people really want me deaded
But Kris won't let it
The same thing that you read I read it
My hair is dreaded
But hip-hop yes you must respect it
We must direct it and use it positively
So these skeptics can learn our mathetics
Like metric I said it
I'm about to shed it
Why don't you check me like your credit
You still don't get it
You twist it like ???? ????
Rappers nowadays sound so pathetic
Yo let me said it
Although my presentation is derided
And hypothetic
My genetics is highly poetic and athletic
But still some don't get it
The paparazzi life is all synthetic
The balancing of the mind is what's authentic
The total body is ultra-magnetic

There's no need to be afraid
Open your mind
Do your knowledge
Do your knowledge
Stop studying your knowledge
And do your knowledge",https://genius.com/Krs-one-knowledge-reigns-supreme-1997-lyrics

And with no sisters, a job you can't seem to get it
Now you applyin for welfare, medicare for health care

I Ain’t Leavin’,Life,UnKnown,"In the hearts of the people you could see my face
Cause at any club they know how I leave the place
(How you leavin' em?) Sweaty yet ready reaching higher for more
My purpose is to inspire the poor
So I fire it raw, the others be out for fame
Yet Knowledge Reigns Supreme, that's a household name
(They is hot!) I doubt they gain
I'm true school like Kurtis, I'll blow out they flame (and they know it!)
They may say the crown, they can hold it
But when I'm in the spot, they dare not show it
Cause they're not poets, exactly that
All they rap for is lust and them platinum plaques
KRS comes after that
This that masterful emcee, I'm from a blast masterful cat
Holding a class in the back
It's obviously I mastered rap, I'm blasting 'em back

I live for the love of the game
I spit, I reign through the struggle and pain
Nineteen years strong been touching their brains
I ain't leavin', I ain't leavin'

My whole life is different, high school I skipped it
Right around fifteen I knew that I was gifted
Self-taught home school specific
Simplistic, my characteristic holistic, a mystic
Everything to me is encrypted
Imbued with the same wind energy that be flowing from my spirit
Those that have ears to hear, hear it
There's no excuse if there's a free library and you don't go near it
Me I seek the truth, others they fear it
They living in the mansions, I'm living in the spirit
That negativity, I will clear it
That productivity, I will share it with all who will hear it
You see now that I exist and can never be told
That hip-hop was about silver and gold
With the mic I hold or held
I try to elevate beyond whatever soul or cell
Yo I sound odd but you know about that camel
That needle the rich man in the kingdom of God
Bring the real, many bring the façade
Them bells in your head, yeah I'm ringing them hard

I live for the love of the game
I spit, I reign through the struggle and pain
Nineteen years strong been touching their brains
I ain't leavin', I ain't leavin'

Operation defacement, face it
Perfect word placement chase it, wait
Catch one incident of intimate images and word
Get comfortable, a ton of bull is held at bay
Keep your ear to the street, peep footsoldier and I told you
When mixtape hit the street, it's curb and concrete
Beat beast, heat feast, don't speak, hold heat
Holy though he better let it
Better get it offer I'm taking position
Young listen
Nice as five high-speed chase to ditch cases
Cali give it three strikes, I might give you four
Bars to get it right, I check the mic in the floor
You ain't bold enough to hold enough
Flow ain't cold enough
Fool I sho nuff showed up to blow that show up
Shoulderin' a brain quicker than DSL modems
When I touch down, I raid your town

Sneak Attack,The Sneak Attack,2001,"We keep it tight.. we keep it right..
We're comin strong.. we're movin on.. (yeah)
It's time to rise.. and unify..
Keep comin strong (uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh!)
Just keep movin on..

Yo, where's my people at?
We be where the elite be at
We really never need the gat, we comin with a sneak attack
In fact, best believe we back
What we rap it heats the track
Kenny Parker sees to that, my job is to teach these cats
Present the clear speech they lack
And show 'em how to eat from rap

We keep it tight.. we keep it right.. (that's right)
We're comin strong.. (uh-huh, yeah) we're movin on.. (tell 'em again!)
(Uhh) It's time to rise.. and unify.. (yeah, yeah)
Keep comin strong (uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh!)
Just keep movin on..

You know why the devil can't get with me?
Cause he's a liar, I've got victory
You can stick with me, my click is free
Negativity, that doesn't live with me
These rappers on one, I've skipped to three
These rappers on A, I've skipped to C
My image, heads ain't quick to be
So I thank you for pickin me
I know why people got to know, these wack rappers got to go
Let a MC rock the show
I'll show 'em how it 'posed to go
We forgot simply what we supposed to know
We still must defeat the foe
So what you got the dough? Your words don't make us glow
In fact they make us slow
How long this gonna take to know you ain't gotta be a hoe?

We keep it tight.. we keep it right.. (yeah)
We're comin strong.. (yeah, yeah) we're movin on.. (uh-huh)
(Tell them again!) It's time to rise.. and unify.. (yeah)
Keep comin strong (uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh!)
Just keep movin on..

Look at the teacher, I stay attuned
People are blessed when I walk in the room
Snakes(?) don't stop me, and if they did
They'd be askin for a tag 'fore they kids
Medical students lose it when I enter any hospital
Doctors wanna talk music and whatever's topical
It's all logical, I perform the impossible
Through words I put hip-hop in you; listen
Here's what we got to do, unify
Defeat the flesh, defeat the beast in you and I
Win or lose I never shout, believe in yourself and never doubt
Discipline is simply a better route

We keep it tight - we keep it tight
We keep it right - we keep it right
We're comin strong - comin strong
We're movin on - movin on!
It's time to rise - it's time to rise
And unify - unifyyyy
Keep comin strong - comin strong
Just keep movin on - keep on movin on
We keep it tight - we keep it tight
We keep it right - we keep it right
We're comin strong - we're comin strong
We're movin on - movin on!
It's time to rise - it's time to rise
And unify - it's time to unify
Keep comin strong
Just keep movin on - keep on movin on
..
Just keep movin on - keep on movin on
Just keep movin on - we gotta keep on movin on
Just keep movin on - wake up and realize
Just keep movin on - that you just keep movin on
Just keep movin on - it's time to realize
Just keep movin on - that you gotta keep movin on
Just keep movin on - keep movin on, keep movin on

From the highest tree top you'll hang
I ride the fly cars like Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
You can't hang, with my mic con-cep-tion
Cause we're not in the same gang, my juice is instant like Tang

You attack next snap back CRACK and I'm the winner

Fairly beatin not cheatin you, heat-seekin and leakin through
All styles be creepin through, in amazement they keepin you
You be thinking, ""What were you doin?  The teacher competes with you?""
You can run like the people do or you stay and you see it through
I be lyrically eatin you anywhere I be seein you
On the hip like I'm beepin you in your mental you're peek-a-boo
No limit what we can do metaphorically teachin you
Tell me what can you show me, simply you do not know me
No I am not your homie, yo my lyrics are Epic

Sing a song if you wanna sing a song

But I can prophesize by lookin in your eyes
If you're right or wrong, it could be all
It's always the little things that control the big things
Undirected mind waves will bring a string
Of unexpected anything until you cipher
Whether niggative or negative you don't need either
You need to direct your thinkin through your speakin
Prevent the negative from leakin out into the atmosphere

We've been having these gatherings for over 12 years
Uhh, my first one, was ah at Latin Quarters in 1987
With Afrika Bambaataa - he threw the first one, that I attended
We kept the tradition going through the Stop the Violence Movement
Through Human Education Against Lies, Rhythm Cultural Institute
And now the Temple of Hip-Hop
This is Hip-Hop's spiritual base
And as a spiritual base, we look to guide the youth in that discipline
Uhh, no culture is a culture, unless it has principles
Unless it has morals, unless - we are unified
In some sort of principle, something we are not going to step beyond
Something that defines us
What I'd like to do, is just for a moment as we.. deal with this
Think about your role in Hip-Hop
Think about what you do everyday in Hip-Hop
This is not about right now
It's about twenty years from now
It's about ten years from now
The tapes are rolling, the notes are being taken
This is the type of thinking we have to get into
If this is going to survive and last
So again, Hip-Hop Appreciation Week, is a time of self-reflection
A time for Hip-Hoppers to ask

Dance Like It Don’t Matter,UnKnown,UnKnown,"CHORUS
Here and now..you've got to live your life...
Don't worry how-- just go hard tonight..
C'mon--Dance like it don't matter...
VERSE 1
Once upon a rhyme, not long ago
Flat tops were in and you cut your afros..
I went to a club on the hip-house scene..
With Doc Marten's and a pair of baggy jeans..
It might've been Queens..or the Bronx, I think..
..and it was 18 to party, 21 to drink..
I blinked in darkness, the suckers let me in..
The night of my life was about to begin..
Inside now.. NOTHING could stop me...
..Three songs later..met the first... Nice body...!
..a good lookin' girl--
From her voice, I could tell she was a Brooklyn girl..
The world stopped...It seemed to vanish..
I asked what she was...half Black, half Spanish..
Not that it mattered, just conversatin..
She went to the bar and I took her invitation...
CHORUS
Here and now..you've got to live your life...
Don't worry how-- just go hard tonight..
C'mon--Dance like it don't matter...
VERSE 2
Everybody move, nobody front...
It was February--Black history month..
I turned my beeper off so I wouldn't be on call..
There were 99 bottles of beer on the wall..
..but..none would fall...so I started to reach..
She had two orgasms and a sex on the beach..
Such each...ice cube..and still wanted more..
You know what I was thinkin'? Mmmm..Lipstick on a straw...
I said to the cutie ""This is where hello stops..""
...then I flavored her tongue with three different jello shots..
..tasted it off her, her eyes got softer..
She said ""You gonna dance now?"" -- I said ""Thanks for the offer...""
Lost all control; the strobe lights was blinding...
Krs was rhyming...this girl was grinding..
My inhibitions were totally shattered..
...and that's when she told me to ""Dance like it don't matter...""
CHORUS
Here and now..you've got to live your life...
Don't worry how-- just go hard tonight..
C'mon--Dance like it don't matter...

Pockets don't grow skinny they grow fatter..
Music pumpin' so damn hard, the glass shatters..

I'm gonna be me, I hope this cat sees me..
Party all packed and the drinks are goin' up..
While KRS raps, it's Greenie blowin' up

Hear it, the spirit--you got the whole place fiendin'..
Real emceeing, real streets you seein'..

I said ""that just can't be""
All these names on the list
You know you just came to see Mos and Q-Tip
Got you baby, don't trip
Cause I'm something like a fan too
Please except this backstage pass Imma hand you
She declined, said she didn't have the time
But Imma find her again, at Rock The Bells 09

Rock, rock, rock the bells
We gotta rock rock the bells
Rock, rock, rock the bells
We gotta rock rock the bells

Supernatural the sweetest, Nas is the realest
You gotta rise up with monsters, to be the best of the biddness
Been ban from LA, looked at as a menis
But GQ picked us up, I'll see you in a minute
Hip hop at it's rawest form, I'm all in it
The gass mask coming, invade your city limmits
Who's bringing 


This is fresh
Rock The Bells, reppin the west
Weapons correct
You losing your breath
2NA classic, the last fish
Better than the best
Verbal gymnastic, I flash with this S on my chest
A defenet threat
The last one you testin I bet
 bring the best of the best
Who has the beat next?
2NA bring the true 
My name came from the name of a Cool J song
Rock The Bells

Rock, rock, rock the bells
We gotta rock rock the bells
Rock, rock, rock the bells
We gotta rock rock the bells

See Tech once, you gotta see Tech twice
Cause on stages, he amazes, when he bless mics
Never thought a midwest gangster would be there that night
You thought there'd be a lot of BS-ing from me, not like
See you is my family, you others best step right
Cause whenever I'm in the mood, yes let's fight
Especially if you another prep that writes
You lip sinck 

Rock, rock, rock the bells
We gotta rock rock the bells

Jason,UnKnown,2016.0,"Fight back, shoot back, loot that, protest
Brick to the helmet, I ain't feeling no stress
Going up against the cops, I ain't wearin' no vest
The city where I come from makes your life 
We try to stay focused, go to school, listen
But for our school, it's just another pre-prison
The only way the people listen is when they threatened
So grab your weapon, it'll be on in a second
Class warfare, yeah, we got it all here
The poor gettin' so poor they cannot even bear
The rich gettin' so rich they cannot even share
Won't give an equal share to those that got 'em there
Label rights, pay what's right
You got the microphone today, my brother
You gotta say what's right
You know the cops work for the first class, not the rear class
So they get the protection and we get the tear gas",https://genius.com/Krs-one-jason-lyrics
Boogie Down Productions’s “You Must Learn”,Conscious Rap Teacher Mixtape Hip Hop Saved My Life,UnKnown,"Just like I told you, you must learn
It's calm yet wild the style that I speak
Just filled with facts and you will never get weak in the heart
In fact you'll start to illuminate, knowledge to others in a song
Let me demonstrate the force of knowledge
Knowledge reigned supreme
The ignorant is ripped to smithereens
What do you mean when you say I'm rebellious
Cause I don't accept everything that you're telling us
What are you selling us the creator dwellin' us
I sit in your unknown class while you're failing' us
I failed your class cause I ain't with your reasoning
You're tryin' make me you by seasoning
Up my mind with see Jane run, see John walk in a hardcore New York
Come on now, that's like a chocolate cow
It doesn't exist no way, no how
It seems to me that in a school that's ebony
African history should be pumped up steadily, but it's not
And this has got to stop, See Spot run, run get Spot
Insulting to a Black mentality, a Black way of life
Or a jet Black family, so I include with one concern, that
You must learn

I believe that if you're teaching history
Filled with straight up facts no mystery
Teach the student what needs to be taught
Cause Black and White kids both take shorts
When one doesn't know about the other ones' culture
Ignorance swoops down like a vulture
Cause you don't know that you ain't just a janitor
No one told you about Benjamin Banneker
A brilliant Black man that invented the almanac
Can't you see where KRS is coming at
With Eli Whitney, Haile Selassie
Granville Woods made the walkie-talkie
Lewis Latimer improved on Edison
Charles Drew did a lot for medicine
Garrett Morgan made the traffic lights
Harriet Tubman freed the slaves at night
Madam C.J. Walker made the straightening comb;
But you won't know this is you weren't shown
The point I'm gettin' at it it might be harsh
Cause we're just walkin' around brainwashed
So what I'm sayin' is not to diss a man
We need the 89 school system
One that caters to a Black return because
You must learn

""Alkebulan"" is the original name
Of Africa, now stripped of it's fame
It's good to know that in ancient times
Egyptians developed all sciences of the mind
To the point where they ruled the planet
But Rome, Greece, and Persia wasn't havin' it
They attacked, and won the war
But it wasn't enough, they had to get to the core
Cause in that time it was Alkebulan
That ruled religion, politics, and man
In order to destroy the Egyptian race
They had to wipe the sciences from off the face of the planet
So they proceeded to ban it
Then replace it with Christianity
And it's, been that way, all the way to today
Learn what we teach; hear what we say
But here comes the K-the-R-the-S-the-O-the-N-the-E
The BDP and we rhyme intelligently
Let me continue with Theodosyius
A Greek ruler not known to most of us
He, in the fourth century A.D.,
Calls the Egyptians fools you see
Two years later, Justinian rules
Six A.D., was it for schools
As a result, ignorance had swirled
Over Christian Europe and Greco-Roman worlds
This went on for a thousand years
Of ignorance, stupidity, and tears
Now comes the seventeenth century hardness
Europe, began to come out of it's darkness
So Johann F. Blumenbach, a German
Came out of nowhere and started confirming
White supremacy and men of colors
Before this time, all men were brothers
It was Johann, who went on to say
There are five different colors in the world today
That's caucasian, malayan, and mongolian
American-Indian, and ethiopian
Yet, the ignorance gets scarier
He believed whites were superior
According to his idiotic fountain
The purest whites were from the Caucas mountains
J. A. Blofener, and H. S. Chamberlain
Both supported this outrageous racism
This went on to what the master race should be
And why they killed the Jews in Germany
Here is the reason why I'm so concerned
Because you, must, learn!!!!",https://genius.com/Krs-one-boogie-down-productionss-you-must-learn-lyrics
