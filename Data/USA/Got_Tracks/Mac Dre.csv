Feelin Myself,Ronald Dregan: Dreganomics,2004.0,"I'm out of this world,
 
not your run of the mill'n
My name is Furl I'm the owner of the building
I'm a stoner and I'm chillin' with two bitches like Jack
I pimps and I mack drive a Benz and a 'lac
Man I've been in the back wit the groupies and the stars
I've been out front with the thugs and the guards
I've been in the yard with the Mexican mafia
And I only run with niggas that'll kill and die for ya
I'm popular, I'm a rap star
But I live like a rock star running from the cop cars
I drop bars wit slaps that knock hard and
 
I charge for this dick extra large
I'm sicker than SARS
 
higher than Mars and
 
I treat my bitch like an ATM card

I'm in the buildin and I'm
 
feelin myself
Man I'm feelin myself
I'm in the buildin and I'm
 
feelin myself
Man I'm feelin myself
I'm in the buildin and I'm

Man I'm feelin myself

She's in the buildin and she's feelin herself
She's lookin bad man I'm willing to help
Stop it baby you're killin' yourself
Come on I got your back you could chill in my Delt'
I'm feelin myself too
Man just imagine some of the things we can do
You under me
Me under you
Then we can catch the Liquor store before 2
We can hit my nigga and go get some shrooms
And if you still want to kick it we can go get a room
It won't cost you much, I'm a good buy
Dick-on-discount? Bitch good bye!
What do I look like Mr. Frank Fuck for Free
No dough ho? You can't fuck with me
Get the fuck out
Bitch you still in my Delt'
You full of shit and I'm feelin' myself

I'm in the buildin and I'm
 
feelin myself
Man I'm feelin myself
I'm in the buildin and I'm

I'm in the buildin and I'm
 
feelin myself
Man I'm feelin myself
I'm in the buildin and I'm
 
feelin myself
Man I'm feelin myself

I'm a West Coast Bad Boy
I represent it
""Dre, that's a bad toy, is it rented?""
Hardy har har very funny
You don't hear my tummy
I gets my money
My stomach ain't growlin
I'm stylin' and wildin', drinkin' vodka straight fuck a Long Island
I want my own island bet you I'm a get it
I switch hit and play with both mitts
Pack a four-fifth I'm after your bitch
He ain't doing it right she's after your scritch
And I'm after hers with these macking words,
 
nerd
I thought squares, stayed sharp
You're nothing but a mark
 
in a bucket Skylark
I'm playing my part
I'm Mr. Furley
Quit interrupting I'm talkin' to your girly

I'm in the buildin and I'm

Thizzle Dance,Thizzelle Washington,2002.0,"Hello everybody...(Hi)..
I'd like to introduce you to the Thizzle Dance...(Thizzle Dance?)
Thizzle Dance I said..
Can you do the Thizzle Dance?

First, I do like this
Put a look on my face like I smelled some piss
Bounce to the beat till it start to hurt
Then I dust all the smirk off me shirt
Dip to the ground as I catch the bass
Then I wipe all the sweat off me face
Hop back up then I start to slide
Popping my collar as I glide
Then I break the thang down and do The Bird
Dust myself off like I just stole third
Come on everybody now's the chance
Fuck the Harlem Shake, this the Thizzle Dance!

Dance, Thizz Dance
Thizz Dance, Thizz Dance
Can you do the Thizzle Dance?
Dance, Thizz Dance
Thizz Dance, Thizz Dance
Can you do the Thizzle Dance?

First of all I hope you got you a juice
A Thizzle because it's time to pop you a few
Then you gas, brake, start to dip
Bounce with the car as it start to shit
Open up the car doze the whole damn car low
Hop out and follow, while you let the car roll
Ghostride the whip while you ride the strip
Here's your chance to do your dance on the side of it
While you at it the passenger and driver switch
Then hurry up and jump back inside your shit
Hanging out the rooftop
Do not get ooh-aahed by them fool cops that tryna have you got
Other than that you and your boys 'coon big
You wanna learn 'coon stay tuned to Thizz
Hoochie-mama freaks, get yo man
And show them niggas how to do the Thizzle Dance

Thizz Dance, Thizz Dance
Can you do the Thizzle Dance?

Ahh, what, Thizz... ahh Thizz what..
Ahh, what, Thizz... ahh Thizz (what)..

When I do it they say I'm killin it
The look on my face mean I'm feelin it
Just like the niggas that I'm chillin wit it
You can't do the thizz unless your pillin it
This is the last verse then I'm sealin it
After this niggas gon be stealin it
This is hip hop with no Johnny Gill-in-it
No New Edition or Prince when I'm spillin it
I'm 12 years strong and I'm still in it
Now I'm slugged up
And diamond grillin it
I don't care who I'm in the building with
I do the dance with Nancy Von Chillinwich

Dance, Thizz Dance
Thizz Dance, Thizz Dance
Can you do the Thizzle Dance?
Dance, Thizz Dance
Thizz Dance, Thizz Dance
Can you do the Thizzle Dance?",https://genius.com/Mac-dre-thizzle-dance-lyrics
She Neva Seen,The Genie of The Lamp,2004.0,"It was a hot night in August, (a hot August night), humid
Hit the store to get some O.J. to shroom with
Ooh, shitty, I'm in the world's biggest little city
Seen a girl with some big ass titties
A top notch saditty, bitch knew she was pretty
Get goosed in the city, get your purse took
When I stepped in her life she felt the earth shook
Before I spit the first hook, let me lace ya
Fucked her, had her crying like somebody maced her
Gave her a taste of some real macaroni
She swore she would do, anything for me
That's no bologna, baby brought me bread
Freaked me on the freeway on the 80, gave me head
She neva seen, a sav in some Timbs
Push an S5 sittin' on some Davin rims

Listen, you wouldn't want to miss this
I met this bitch the night before Christmas
Baby made my hit list Christmas night
She let a nigga hit by the Christmas lights
This bitch was tight, just my type
Barely ripe, ride a dick like a bike
Hit a dick like a pipe, quick late night hype
Them the kinda thangs that makes my night
The steak ain't right without the A-1
So I stay dipped in sauce and they come
Like baby did, like that nigga old lady did
Like Karen, Kameka, and Katie did
It's crazy, kid, mami on my bozack
I'm pimpin' and she knows that
Nigga, where the hoes at?
Bet they neva seen, a sav in Timbs
Push an S5 sittin' on some Davin rims

Me and Black Jesus went to Rosaritas
Seen senoritas eating carnitas
I was rocking my Adidas sneakers
Told the waitress, ""get me fajitas""
Gold teethas, left her speechless
Gave me the number with a Fairfield prefix
Dipped to the Cougar, put up the Ruger
In the stash spot, a wise maneuver
Put up the cougar, pulled out the MB
California Hot Boy, MD
The boss, that do the firing and hiring
Sweat a broad, I keep 'em perspiring
She's admiring the way I slide
The way I ride, and how her boyfriend lied
She's neva seen a sav in Timbs
Push an S500 sittin' on some Davin rims

She only sees me, with European keys
She only sees me, with woodgrain Sprees
She only sees me, with Champelli trees
She only sees me, having hella G's",https://genius.com/Mac-dre-she-neva-seen-lyrics
Get Stupid,Ronald Dregan: Dreganomics,2004.0,"When we pull up to the light, the people all stare
Four niggas in the Benz with the dreadlock hair
Smoke everywhere, wavin at Madeline
On them woodgrain Davins with the license plate rattlin'
Doin' what we want to, hangin' out the sunroof
Mental, we ignorant, boy, we go dumb dude
Gas break dip, we call it yokin'
Do a donut in yo whip, we call it dosin'
Get stupid, is what we do good
Ghost ride the whip while we dancing on the hood
I'm amped feeling good, I'm hyphy
In a bitch face with a thizz face off a Nike
The women like me, I'm dipped in butter
I'll rob your brother pimp the blood out your mother
I'm mister stupid doo-doo dumb
Sumthin' Terrible
, tell 'em how we come

We go S - T - U - P - I - D
When we go to the club we don't need ID
Everywhere we go its a party yall
We gone get it cracking like the Mardi Gras
Get stupid, get stupid, get stupid, get stupid
Go stupid, go stupid, go stupid
Come and go stupid with me

I'm a dog, hound, 
Crestside clown
Gig so hard make my pants fall down
This beat pounds, cutty where'd you get it?
Oh you ain't know, Dr. Dre did it
I come wit it, rapping and rhyming
Dancin, pantomiming, acting like I'm driving
Then switch it up, dance like him fishing
See in the bay area we dance a lil different
The bay bounce to thizzle, the west coast wizzle
Do they get stupid, come fuck with Drizzle
Call the hospital, he's having convulsions
No he's gettin' stupid, in his load yokin'
Is the store still open?
We need heem, 
that Privilege thing
...yadadamean?
All in the throw like yee
S - T - U - P - I - D

We go S - T - U - P - I - D
When we go to the club we don't need ID
Everywhere we go its a party yall
We gone get it cracking like the Mardi Gras
Get stupid, get stupid, get stupid, get stupid
Go stupid, go stupid, go stupid
Come and go stupid with me

Alright, let me tell you why we call this thing stupid
Cause, when I dance the chicks, say: 
'you stupid'
You can do it, it ain't that hard
Baby get dumb, act like a retard
Shake your hair, make it blow in the air
You gotta get into it, growl like a bear
Now say Wha! 
'What?'
 No, Wha!
Do the damn thing girl cut that shit up
Fill your cup, don't be no punk
It don't look right if you really ain't drunk
Come on, repeat after me we go S - T - U - P - I - D

Stupid? Hahaha
We go S - T - U - P - I - D
When we go to the club we don't need ID

Not My Job,The Genie of The Lamp,2004.0,"Dre rock the jewelry with the clear stones
And get on a nigga head like some headphones
I'm finna spit it with a clear tone
Get your attention
The biggest thing since the TV invention
Dope as Zoloft, a big shot, a show off
Plus, I'm a big pimp, I get tore off
Fuck a good job, she need a good jaw
To sell BJs 'til her mouth get raw
I'm from the California coast, beaches and bridges
Hit the cock, get ghost, I don't be sleeping with bitches
I got a Cougnut, sitting on wires
On vogues, bitch, not Michelin tires
Can't control my desires
I buy from Nordstrom's, not Fred Meyer's
I do a lot of weed, love my supplier
She keep it, fuck the blood out my supplier
Man, I'm bigger than life, I do it Magnum
And 'bout these broke bitches, I'm through with having 'em
Dre bogard, he shove and he push
And start a war for nothing like G.W. Bush
We be loving the kush, but only in the Backwood
Without a Backwood, it ain't all that good
I'm from the streets, where most need heat
But I'll slice a nigga up like some roast beef meat

I can bust you a rap, but anything else, not my job
I'll peel your cap back, but anything else, not my job
I'll get you for racks, but anything else, not my job
I'll make you a slap, but anything else is not my job

Bitch gon' ask me to come with her to grocery shop
I told her straight up like this, no siree Bob
That's not my job, I don't do that
I'm a pimp slash rapper, I thought you knew that
And where your dude at? Should I serve him the news
And let him know he's finna be walking in some brand new shoes?
Ooh, you a fool, gotta watch thyself
One false move and can't stop thyself
Sometimes I'm not myself, I'm another man
I'm a rockstar, in another band
Plus, I'm the man with the plan in his hands
Soon, we all playing in sand
'Cause to my estimations and these calculations
And all the money I made off The Rompalation
I'm finna get as many digits that's on a license plate
And shit on some of these midgets, bitch, I can't wait

I can bust you a rap, but anything else, not my job
I'll peel your cap back, but anything else, not my job
I'll get you for racks, but anything else, not my job
I'll make you a slap, but anything else is not my job

When I dip, they trip off what Furl dressed in
Plus, I got a mouth full of girl's best friend
I'm a Back to the Future, new game kind of nigga
Y'all lames is plain, drinking the same kind of liquor
Wearing the same kind of clothes, fucking the same kind of hoes
And you Bedrock pimping, meaning your game's kind of old
And you don't want it with me, I'll bother ya
So get lost, pal, before I clobber ya
I got golden gloves, I'll give you a new look
With a stiff left and a sharp right hook
Niggas know snitches, they ride and they go with them
It's all gravy, as long as they don't tell on them
Me and my team, see, we a machine
You fuck with my mans, and I'ma have to intervene
I'm a sport coat and a sancho
Always looking out for Benny Blanco",https://genius.com/Mac-dre-not-my-job-lyrics
Since ’84,Ronald Dregan: Dreganomics,2004.0,"C'mon
Let's do it
What it is
Thizz is what it is
Another knocker
Kick this game around like soccer

Pull up a chair let me make you a plate
Of this game that's seasoned like a tasty steak
Since '88 I've been serving them well
I was serving yayo when L was Rocking Bells
Clocking mail, get, get, getting it
Copping it, flipping it, flip, flip, flipping it
Now I'm spitting it bar for bar
European whipping it car for car
No dough, hoe? You know I say no
I need you like Jaws need a rain coat
I fandangoes, stay high as the Star Spangled
Choke the blood out you, bitch, get strangled
Get mangled fucking with this pimpin'
Hot as Lipton, Dre Jay Simpson
You better pay attention, it's all gamed up
Peep the bio, the file, see how I came up

Since '84 I been out there gettin' my dough
In the Sco the O and Valley Jo
Getting rich in the Rich and San Jo
Grinding and rhyming and pimpin' hoes
Rolling on vogues and 2-4s
Dre Tripper gotta stay with two hoes
Stay with zippas, boy, I keep a few O's
Get bossed and say 'thar she blows!'

When I sweat her I say 'read my lips'
Bring me cheddar, bitch, bring me chips
Fingertips, ass, hips and lips
Follow my lead, don't ask questions bitch
I want fresh fits from Abercrombie & Fitch
When it's going down, the Mac comes and shits
The Mac comes to spit
Let me do it to your ear baby
I'm trying to flip, see I do it every year baby
Real off the laddish, getting my cottage
Cheese, geez, please, beez, freeze
Stop it, you're heading down the wrong path
Fuck making love, bitch, I want a tongue bath
Dumb cash, can you do it like me?
Cash a fat check at the bank with no I.D
Can you blow by me when I'm doing 100?
Smacking, slapping in my 500

Since '84 I been out there gettin' my dough
In the Sco the O and Valley Jo
Getting rich in the Rich and San Jo
Grinding and rhyming and pimpin' hoes
Rolling on vogues and 2-4s
Dre Tripper gotta stay with two hoes
Stay with zippas, boy, I keep a few O's
Get bossed and say 'thar she blows!'

I got cutthroat friends and lots of women
I ride in a Benz but I'll squat a lemon
I want a stuffed turkey with all the trimmings
To pay and play extra innings
I'm winning, fat lady start singing
I'm finna get the Cougnut and start swinging
Skeet, dance and eight
And when they run my plates, model and make
I'mma shake, like I'm riding with a cake
Pedal to the metal, rarely hit the brake
I love a high-speed getaway
They wanna get rid of Dre, put the kid away
What I'm in today, I'm in the 7 series
So quiet you can't even hear me
Engine, when I smash the gas
And would you look at all that wood on the dash

Since '84 I been out there gettin my dough
In the Sco the O and Valley Jo
Getting rich in the Rich and San Jo
Grinding and rhyming and pimpin' hoes
Rolling on vogues and 2-4s
Dre Tripper gotta stay with two hoes
Stay with zippas, boy, I keep a few O's

Something You Should Know,Al Boo Boo,2003.0,"When I got the phone call, I was rollin' on the interstate
“Dre, have you ate yet? How’s about a dinner date?”
“Hmm, I don't know, let me check my schedgy
I'm free at 8:30, pick me up when you’re readgy”
Hopped out the Chevy, so I could freshen up
Rolled a sack in the back and put my weapon up
Poured a glass of 7-Up and ate a quick snack
Salami and swiss piled on a Ritz crack
Called the punk bitch back, “What’s up, Alice?”
She got the maddest, said “My name’s not Alice”
“Alright, Alice pick me up from my palace
I stay in 
West Linn
, I know you know where that is”
“That's where my dad lives; be there in a jiffy”
Threw on some 150s and my red Ken Griffey
T-shirt crispy, I’m dipped as usual
Shave with the Andis electric reusable
Threw in my removable iced out grill
So when I spit my spill it’s chilly chill
I'm really ill, really feel, really mackish
I'm waitin’ on the bitch and I’m puffin’ on some cat piss
Damn, where you at, bitch? I started thinkin’
Baby pulled up in an Aviator Lincoln
Grabbed me thump thang ‘cause they won't catch me leakin’
‘Cause punks hang and try to bang every weekend
I started speakin’, “This a hell of a car”
I said, “Where we eating?” She said, “The Elephant Bar”
I said “The hell if we are; I'd rather Benihana's”
She said “What’s that for?” I said “For any drama”
Now look little mama, it's a quarter to ten
Can't be out all night, I gotta stop when the song end
Now at the restaurant, I’m feelin’ like the man
Spoke Japan “give me moo goo gai pan”
Ate, drank, got full and burped
I said “Alright, you beezy, it’s time to curt”
Dipped to her spot that was tucked in the cut
Put dick to the cot then I busted a nut
Then I busted a nut one mo gin
Then I busted a nut on the hoe chin
Now here we go again, another fiasco
I'm digging her out while I'm playin’ with her asshole
Fuck being bashful, baby, I'm a bash pro
She said “Dre, I’ll give you anything you ask for”
You got class, hoe
…now look
Pay close attention, I'm finna sing the hook
Before I give you some mo'
(Before I give you some mo')
There's something that you must know
(There's something you must know)
I'm a pimp and I got hoes
(I'm a pimp and I got hoes)

That's steady gettin taller

You hoe
You just don't understand
Check it out though

Sippin' Martinis eatin scampi and linguini
Makin' blunts disappear, like I'm Houdini
Laid up with Asians that know tongue fu
Gettin' blew when I got the call from Young Dru
He was speakin thizzlamic but I can understand it
He said ""Al Boo Boo, the eagle has landed""
My reply: 'Pronto, cousin
Execute stage two, put the turkey in the oven'
For those who don't know that means he got the blow
And it's time to turn the blow into more dough
Sell 'em high, buy 'em low, let 'em fly, let 'em go
Birdies of the snow straight from Valley Jo
Who got it? Nigga, Dru got it
And if you hit him on the hip, he'll make sure that you got it
Me and my team, we tryna win
And we keep it mafioso, you hear the violins

Run away, boy
Shakin' the blades and gay boys

Choppin' down kicks to picks, boy
Weighin' zips, boy
Takin' them trips for chips, boy
Coppin' whips, boy

All of my life I followed the path
A D-Boy, B-Boy, have cash, live lav'
Got game like Bob Costas

Eatin' seafood sauce put over pastas
You imposters get tried for treason
To the Nation of Thizzlam is my allegiance
Write a grievance, file a complaint
Tell 'em Dre doin' things that them other guys can't
Burnin' rubber all day, drivin' wreckless

It's not often young niggas get a chance
To enjoy riches in legitimate fashion
So many of us say fuck it get a bucket
And run up in something and keep smashing
It's all about survival
But jealous rivals make it hard for us to do this
So everybody got a gun but when we was younger
Our only weapon was our two fists
Now who missed the first lesson in life don't be no punk
If you a man have heart be a savage whether you sober or drunk
I seen niggas in the pen getting
Their ass dug out over some hop or a pack of Kamels
But thats the game home boy and every move you make is a gamble
Them squares don't under stand so it takes niggas like me to explain it
I show vengeance violence and hatred because underneath it's so much pain
I ain't no sissy or punk so don't trip when you see me crying
A nigga just hella mad his partners is dead and his folks keep on dying
My enemys feel the same way they want me dead they think I'm the nigga
That put they partner 6 feet under and left his son with no father figure
I live day by day not giving a fuck and when they ask me why
I pause for a minute then I reply because lifes a bitch and then you die

Bitch
Life's a bitch
Life's a bitch and then you die
Life's a bitch and then you die
Lifes a bitch and then you die
Lifes a bitch and then you die

Lifes a bitch then you die nigga
Don't want a whole slice just let me taste the pie
They sent me to the pen for five years
For a crime that was never committed
I ain't no bank robber but that five years
Had me thinking maybe I should have did it
Do my thoughts deceive me? What a mutherfucker supposed to think
Locked down trapped looking at four walls a toilet bowl and a sink
Ain't that a bitch I've been struggling ever since I could remember
But I stay strong year round from January all the way to December
See I am a hustler I need cash bad as a fat bitch need jogging
So I specialize in three things and thats
Pimping hogging and dogging (thats right)
Half these suckers walking around here fake as three dollar bills
If you with that bullshit don't come around me
I do this for reals not for thrills
I got to watch my back for them suckers thats out to do harm
Got a tattoo of a list full a partners
Thats dead that run all the way down my arm
So If you see me mugging tripping and bugging don't stop and ask me why
A nigga just hella mad because Lifes a bitch and then you die

Bitch
Life's a bitch
Life's a bitch and then you die
Life's a bitch and then you die
Lifes a bitch and then you die
Lifes a bitch and then you die

I got a crew full of the realest thats deep as the Pittsburgh Steelers
Retired bank robbers ex-dope dealers and adversary killers
Our mission is simple get rich and stay real nigga
So our kids can live fat better then we did when we was little niggas
Life is short you only live once and ain't no telling when your leaving
So I'm going to do it all have a ball
While I'm still living and breathing
See I am a philosopher and my philosophy is this
Don't be no punk young homey if it's worth it take that risk
Anything's possible but nothings for sure
Got to take advantage of all opportunities
And get your money you know
Love those who love you but don't never let it fuck up your vision
How much love did your loved ones
Have when you was broke or doing time in prison
Stay on your toes don't fuck with hoes before you read them
Watch your back for them rats that set niggas up to keep they freedom
It takes 365 days for the earth to spin one time
But it only takes one minute
For that guilty verdict when that snitch drops that dime
A damn shame I thought rat heads get nothing but cheddar
But I got partners doing all day with 35 next to that letter
So I'm in trouble unless I bubble So I struggle to keep my peace
Staying money motivated with thoughts of Mike Robinson and D.J. Cee

Bitch
Life's a bitch
Life's a bitch and then you die
Life's a bitch and then you die
Lifes a bitch and then you die
Lifes a bitch and then you die",https://genius.com/Mac-dre-lifes-a-bitch-lyrics
Make You Mine,The Genie of The Lamp,2004.0,"Something about what you've done to me, baby, I wanna make you mine
You really bring out the best in me, baby, can I make you mine

I went bad on a bitch, but I don't love her
She want an apology but I ain't Ruben Studdard
I'm buttered, so she jock me style
She buttered, but she not me style
She don't got it and she ain't trying to have it
Man, I'm lavish and got expensive habits
If I stab it, what can she offer?
Naw sir, Dreezy ain't gon' toss her
And she thick too, but I don't want her yokes
I want all her Federal Reserve notes
I'm better with no hoes over a broke one
I'll take the ugliest bitch in Oakland
And come through yolkin' Chucky Cheesed up
You broke bitches got me fucked up
I'm a rich nigga, I got lawyers
You broke, I can't do nothin' but ignore ya

Something about what you've done to me baby I wanna make you mine
You really bring out the best in me baby can I make you mine

This crazy motherfucker wanna be my chick
Always trying to fuck and suck my dick
It won't happen, you ain't got no mail
You ain't got a snowball's chance in hell
I'm from Vallejo where most niggas is pimps
We eat butterfly tiger prawns not scrimps
On the other side of the fence, what's crackin'?
Did you detect some slackin' in my mackin'?
You can't try it unless you buy it
Broke bitch got my dick on a diet
Can't fuck on her and no I don't want her
This is O.J. Simpson pimpin' not Homer

Something about what you've done to me, baby, I wanna make you mine
You really bring out the best in me, baby, can I make you mine

She trying to make me hers but I can't be hers
Unless I'm goosing her for chips and I'm taking hers
Trying to live so fat I gotta watch calories
It's all about a salary, and that's reality
I'm a book you shouldn't judge by its cover, hoe
I been getting dough since Young Black Brotha, hoe
I'm a brother that can make things happen
Jacking, acting, macking, rapping
Let's get it crackin', get the slacking out
Every day I blow a half an ounce
I like to smash and bounce in all new whips
What can we do if you ain't got a few chips?
Take a few sips of this game I poured
It's money in the streets and it can't be ignored
It's money in the streets and it can't be ignored

Something about what you've done to me, baby, I wanna make you mine

Do anything to win my referees cheat

Read em and weep
I'm a royal flush
Give me some shrooms
So I can get mushed
Kick dust, always in something tight
Hella loud with the whistle or the suction pipe

Yes, what would you like?
(I want uh... pack of Backwoods...pack of Backwoods
Give me a fifth of that privilege Hennessy and uh... thats it)
Thank you very very much

What you know about me? I'm Mac Dreezy
Call Hennessy heem and a blunt a bleezy
I keep a fat sack wrapped in a Backwood leaf
Smoke trees that make me look Japanese
Green seedless, mean when I'm weedless
Never in denial, I'm a fiend and I need this
Any day is a bad day for Mac Dre
When he ain't got it, they ask why he act that way
I smoke champ, kush and Naid
""Man, what's Naid?"" Bomb that's sprayed
I can't fade a beezy who don't keep a bleezy
Rolled for a neezy
I ask her, 'What the feezy?'
I gotta have weed to go get weed
You don't like it, kiss my ass 'til your lips bleed
This one's for the club so I'm kinda like keeping it clean
Sing it with me y'all...

(Bleezies n heem)
I gots to have my dope
Everywhere I go (Bleezies n heem)
When they ask me, what's my drink?
I say heem, man, what you think?

I L-O-V-E H double-E M
I drink like ten of them things that swim
""He's heeming again"" is what they say when I come around
I'll get dumb drunk and fuck up your compound
Your building, your establishment
Mobbin', saying ""Cuddie, I'm hella bent""
Oh what a feeling when you're looking at the ceiling
And it's spinning and the earl starts spilling
I drink heem when I perk, don't like Erk and Jerk
It don't work, when a nigga chillin'
Might spill it on my Abercrombie Fitch
Know I got the man at the liquor store rich
Well baby would you please run and get...
Me another Hennessy fifth?

Fire up, lets get drunk
Get your cup, fill it up, don't be no punk
A party ain't a party if every damn body
Ain't lifted and a little bit tipsy
But don't drink and drive, I remember one time
My cuddie Joogy, wrapped his fifty, rap this with me
And if you don't understand
You a inbred, your daddy and your uncle was the same man
I gotta have dope everywhere I go
When they ask me what I drink I say, ""Heem, what you think?""
I gets heem in me, only substitute is Rémy
In Sac with Jimmy, or in Portland with Kenny
I'm danked out, dranked out, can't talk, can't count
If I want some more I'm making baby pull her bank out
You cool on the bomb? What do you mean?
Sing it to him y'all...

Now before I start rapping, I must warn ya
I just washed down two mushrooms with some orange juice
I was thizzin' when I wrote this, forgive me if it goes astray
It's just one of the many dumb flows of Dre
I'm tryna see G's, play these hoes like CD's
Old school like the Bee Gee's, Billy Green and some Wheaties
You don't want to see these, I don't give no freebies
Ho, this dick cost, what you thought, I fucked with stingies??
Give me, send me, bring me what you got
Then baby maybe I'll love like my two Glocks
I'm too hot, I do not, fuck with no 
havers
I'm a Crestside cut-throat, a cold toe-tagger
A ho capturer, then keep 'em in captivity

I bring heat like one hot jalapeño

I bring heat like one hot jalapeño

Smoov with the groove, when I run right thru, and boy I just might pull it
With a all black hat, and a fat dro sack, bring heat just like a bullet
Got a all new fits and a brand new bitch
For this girl, dick's a no-no,
 
so
I picked up a bottle of Captain Morgan's, took her to the mo-mo
I had to hit the cho-cho
Boy this ain't no ho stroll
But in my town these girls get clowned like they first name was Bobo
Can't shake E, or break E,
 stay around like a 12 day hickey
Girl it's tasty, like Lacey, took it all like a 
wide-mouth Mickey

I mob like Durango, seat tilted lay-low, boy
I bring heat like one hot jalapeño
I mob like Durango, seat tilted lay-low, boy
I bring heat like one hot jalapeño

This game gets sticky, these hoes get tricky
Ya boy gets picky, see I hang with 
Nicky
And cats like Mac Dre, we dress in khaki
That backup band bass, shows how much this rap pay
We kicks with Mary, Jane and Judy
My piece like Larry cause getting ass is my duty
Don't trip or slip, just do my thang
Smoov pimped out like a pinky ring

I mob like Durango, seat tilted lay-low, boy
I bring heat like one hot jalapeño
I mob like Durango, seat tilted lay-low, boy
I bring heat like one hot jalapeño

Something's got ta happen, something's definitely got to happen
I hope she get ran the fuck over

Give her the script that I want her to play

Now she wants to pay her dues
Show her what these players do, down in Vegas

Garlic and cheese on my French bread
Swallow it please when I get head
I'm pimp fed, girls feed me well
Never would they let the world see me fail
They bring me mail, like I'm a mailbox
A pimp with no gators, Air Force and Shell Tops

Back in the day I used to need the knocks
Posted at the spot, I used to bleed the block
Servin' weed and rocks, soft and even hop
Never leavin' the spot, wouldn't even leave for cock
If I needed some cock I made hutch come through
Go deep when she bend over, hut 1-2
What you wan' do with rude boy like me
Quick to come through with crew so hyphy
If she don't like me she must be a lesbo
I get it nightly, man, that's my schedule
Dre Bledsoe, I'm the quarterback
Whatever cost the most, I'ma order that
Across the border strapped my esés come through
With fluff from Peru, I come from a crew
Of cutthoats, bank robbers, and dope dealers
It's business with us, nigga, get out yo' feelin's
Get out yo' scrill and live like a king
Take the top off the Heem, pop you a thing
I don't buss 'em in half, it leave a nasty taste
I swallow 'em hole and get the Thizz face
It's laced, with nothin' but game
I steal 'em from niggas, that be cuffin' they dame
I'm fuckin' his main, while he gettin' his grind on
Get bossed, it cost, get paid then I'm gone
My tone, is loud sometimes
I scream at a bitch like she a crowd sometimes
Tell her a thousand times, 'hoe, go make it happen'
It's consequences if she don't make it happen
I'm tryin' to find some bitches that's dope paper havin'
Only into one thing, that's more paper havin'
You no paper havin', niggas is bootsy
All at the function in that Chinamen Gucci
Tryin' to coochie, you wine and dine chicks
Goin' for it, fallin' for mind tricks
I'm tryin' to find chicks, that know the requirements
And works towards a pimp's early retirement",https://genius.com/Mac-dre-early-retirement-lyrics
Dipped When You See Me,Al Boo Boo,2003.0,"I'm dipped when they see me
They don't wanna see me
These niggas wanna be me
These niggas wanna be me
I'm dipped when they see me
They don't wanna see me
These niggas wanna be me
These niggas wanna be me

I smoke backwood blunts cuz they the most expensive
Me no work don't touch no nuts and wrenches
You always see me shopping like it's Christmas
I'm always tree shopping like it's Christmas
Miami my witness
Un-flammy relentless
Yes I pimp bitch and no I didn't rent this
I'm showing no interest in them girls thats broke
You need bank and dank for Furl to smoke
Jumbo prawns and australian lobster
I want everything life has to offer
Coppas jealous cuz me an my fellas
Eat fillets no more hot dogs and rellish
Two sets of grills, Two sets of wheels
Whatever I feel I do sex and pills
Coogi in the winter with the matchin' beanie
Eating linguini
I'm dipped when they see me

I'm dipped when they see me
They don't wanna see me
These niggas wanna be me
These niggas wanna be me
I'm dipped when they see me
They don't wanna see me
These niggas wanna be me

It's my turn to live like the Osbournes
Keep rollin baby lets smoke til our eyes burn

You been drivin in that same old Chevy for years

Boy you better hurry up flip you a model
And some of that new car smell, that come in a bottle

Too Hard for the Fuckin’ Radio,Young Black Brotha (LP),1993,"Listen up, I'm about to get dope
It ain't nothin' but some shit I wrote
About a young brotha deep in the game
They call me Mac Dre and I'm keepin' the name
I sport Nike shoes, I got a mic to use
To talk bad about suckers, I don't like the fools
Down and dirty bout spittin' my hits
And if not, I'm gettin' my grits
Playin' the game like it's supposed to be played
Makin' much more than the minimum wage
Not a pimp daddy, don't drive a Caddy
I just mack and get all that babby
Dre, you know I never slow down
Smokin' cesstee until I'm really towed down
Walk into the party, fully perked
Grab the microphone and let the mouthpiece work
I got hype and the game starts flowin'
The girls get freaky and it starts showin'
And when the party's over at the end of the night
They say: Damn, Mac Dre you ain't nothin' polite
'Cause I'm the numero uno, could never be the dos
A Mac named Dre and I'm poppin' the most
18, makin' raps 'til I'm 80 though
And too hard for the fuckin' radio

""Tell me something good""
I'm too hard for the fuckin' radio

My rhymes are dope 'cause Mac Dre made 'em
And made you geek every time you play them
On your tape deck, hooked to your ZAPCO
A little hard, but brotha I'm a mack, though
Nothin' nice, makin' raps that you wanna hear
Gettin cessted, put my hands on the beer
I can't help it, that's what I like to do
Sloppy drunk, rappin' on the mic for you
A young brotha, kinda bone-skinny
I take a girl to the Golden Penny
Get romantic, just like I planned it
Then cut turf and leave the girl stranded
Is it hard because I just beat it?
Not really, that's what the girl needed
That's game, I thought that you knew this
Mack game, and mine is the smoothest
Like lotion I'm in motion
I'm a mack, I was a big ocean
But no matter what the fuck your name is
Nothin' nice is what my game is
18, makin' raps 'til I'm 80 though
And too hard for the fuckin' radio

""Tell me something good""
I'm too hard for the fuckin' radio

Come to the Northside of the V
The C the R the E the S-T
Hit Leonard, what will be seen?
20 young niggas gettin' full of the heem
This is the Romper Room, and you know who I am
The Mac named Dre, so get with the program
Nothin' proper, freaks will clock ya
And if there's funk, then punk we'll mop ya
So beware of the four-door Delta
Get your crew if you think they can help ya
And step up but not too close
'Cause the Crestside is poppin' the most
And all you girls, don't you feel left out
And to the boys, I've worn that flesh out
And after that we can still be friends though
And if not, we'll be friends with the Indo
Romper Room kickin' on Leonard Street
Mac Dre full of the Hennessy
18, makin' raps 'til I'm 80 though
And too hard for the fuckin' radio

""Tell me something good""
I'm too hard for the fuckin' radio",https://genius.com/Mac-dre-too-hard-for-the-fuckin-radio-lyrics
Feeling Like That Nigga,The Musical Life of Mac Dre Vol 3 - The Young Black Brotha Years: 1996-1998,1996,"Chillin' at a house party, me and my 40
Chokin' off dank rolled up in a pierogi
Cot everywhere, I mean the bitches was at that
I'm peepin' the scene seeing who I'm a mac at
This bitch walked in lookin real prizznity
With no hesitation, I step to the brizznity
Said, ""How you doin', baby, can I spit at you?
Saucy young tender, can I get at you?""
She musta recognized the potent pimpin' on sight
'Cause she was jockin' MD for the rest of the night
We smoked dank, and drank Tanqueray
I said, ""Baby, are you sure you can hang with Dre?""
With the party still poppin' we shook the spot
Cut to my Brougham and I took the cot
For 25 minutes MD was shovin' it
She was screamin' my name and I could tell she was lovin' it
Cock was thrusted, nuts was busted
In this no good bitch that some nigga trusted
Pulled up my pants and she put on some lipstick
Went back in the party feelin' pimperistic
I couldn't help but notice that this nigga was starin'
I thought he was trippin' off the clothes I was wearin'
But, he stepped to MD and said, ""What's up, punk?
You been fuckin' my bitch and now I want some funk""
I said, ""I'm not with the drama so you can save the theatrical
I macked on your bitch 'cause she appeared to be mackable""
But instead of this nigga being real on a playa
He took a step back and tried to steal on a playa
I said, ""Look fool, nobody smashes Dre
I throw these thangs like young Cassius Clay""
With one blow, I sent the punk to the flo'
And said, ""Get your ass up if you want some more""
These niggas ran up, they musta been his crew
Now tell me what the fuck was I supposed to do?
Cut to the Brougham and got the M-double-8
So I can get these muthafuckas from up out of my face
Let off a rat-a-tat, hopped in my Cadillac
And burned long rubber on them suckas I gatted at
Yeah

I got my choppa on my left with my finger on the trigga
Rollin' in a glasshouse feelin' like that nigga
Suckas started static last night now I'm searchin'
Finna put some work in, 'gnac got me perkin'
Seen a sucka posted with his bitch at the liquor store
Put in the clip and go, didn't mean to hit the ho
Fully automatic Mac-11 spittin' fast
Make sure I get that ass, then I hit the gas
Punch it to the hood, switchin' up now I'm back
Rollin' in the 'Lac, still sippin 'gnac
Rollers to their right get behind me, I don't trip
They lookin' for a nigga in a Chev, I don't slip
High speed chase if they want to harass me
Put the lights on, switch lanes then pass me
Had me kinda noid but no longer am I spooked
And man, like I said, if they jacked me they was juked
Creep to the spot where the homeboys romp
Niggas on the dice gettin' paid shootin' twamps
30 minutes later pockets fat now I'm cool
Steppin' out the house, niggas scream ""Get that fool""
Suckas smash up in the deuce and a squirrel
Three bald heads and a nigga with a curl
Bullets let loose, I get it in the chest
Fools smash off screamin', ""Trick, fuck the Crest""
Waitin' for the muthafuckin' ambulance
Thinkin' to myself: I don't stand a chance
Dizzy and my breathing is impossible
Next thing I know I'm at the hospital
Wakin' up hurt, fresh out the trauma
Lookin' at my bitch, and my baby's mama
They tryna act cool, but I know they hate it
My baby's mama said, ""Damn Dre, you barely made it""
Straight tore back, sore than a muthafucka
Thinkin' to myself: Man, I gotta smoke another sucka
Chillin', illin', back on the street
Strapped with my gat layin' in the back seat
Got a white boy drivin' lookin' like a nerd
Rollin' in a fucked up Thunderbird
Got my gloves on, hoodie and my mask and
Mad than a muthafucka, finna do some blastin'
We hit this dope track like we lookin' for some rocks
And I hop out the back door and quickly get to poppin'
Suckas start droppin', and I stop cappin'
And hop back in, just like nothin' happened
I'm puttin' in work, killin' fools dissin'
A muthafuckin' savage, a nigga on a mission
Yeah",https://genius.com/Mac-dre-feeling-like-that-nigga-lyrics
Bonus Track (Song 4 U),The Genie of The Lamp,2004.0,"Acid, booze, and ass, needles, guns, and grass
Acid, booze, and ass, needles, guns, and grass, lots of
There is a song for you
There is a song for you
There is a song for you
*stutter* There is, there is

They say Benzes roll, Beamers jet, and Caddies keep on dippin'
Well, I must be trippin', I'm in a old-school pie flippin'
Sellin' them high, gyppin', tendin' to my pimpin'
Times slippin', late, I'm on my way
Not enough hours in the day to be Dre
I'm el presidente, I run tings
Tote gun things and never run from things
Braveheart but I'm not Mel Gibson
I'm dope like coke that was cooked in the kitchen
Dabbin' revolution, stab it and I'm goosin'
Mini-me laptops, many beats that knock
Lotsa hemp, lobster, not shrimp
Big prawns maybe, I pimps on baby
Always shoppin', no more hall moppin'
Hella Nikes with Gucci, hella nights with coochie

I tell baby play Casper
Be friendly ghost on 'em, after you host on 'em
She a team player, I play coach on 'em
Like a doobie in a joint, play roach on 'em
Won't smoke on 'em
If it ain't dollalala-lalala lotsa notes on 'em
C status, won't holla till it's G status
I'm cutthoat, Three-C savage
Whatever me want, me have it, see me lavish
Your trash might be cash, gimme that, bitch
Like lil mama in labor, I push puss
That's real talk, all scrill talk, cuz cuz
Rather fuck then cut
One G, ah nah, bitch, wasn't enough
And to this day, won't love, won't get paid
And for you, here a song like the bitch say

Now, I could talk a bitch brain out her noggin
And slide across thin ice like toboggans
Wizzle be a fool 'fore we get to smobbin'
Bitch, quit sobbin', get a trick dick throbbin'
Now, you could be a sidekick like Batman and Robin
On all-star, pimp shit, that beat got her bobbin'
Her head, don't stop, like she keep on noddin'
And all I do is collect and sell the product
I knock a Baywatch bitch dipped in Prada
And still check all of it, every dollar
And I don't even call but they hear me holla
And yeah that bitch trained to run game on scholars
Get it for your father or don't even bother
A bitch circuits overload, I won't stop her
Bitch nonstop, hold up, robotic
And every piece of dough that bitch touch, I got it",https://genius.com/Mac-dre-bonus-track-song-4-u-lyrics
4 Myself,Thizzelle Washington,2002.0,"I want you for myself
You can't have no one else
I want you for myself
You can't have no one else

See I'm a cold polecat
I hope she know that
Shitty off the titty and dope as Prozac
Spit the anthrax, leave a dent in your brain
Please believe ain't no cuffing me mayne, fuck a dame
Trying to put her hooks in me, I go Bo Billy
Wanna get with me, let her dough get with me
Keep the big heads crispy, ducking it up
I do the dirt then I'm fucking it up
Bitch what the fuck is you hollerin'
Bitch check your noggin
Fore' I pull out the pecker then peck at your noggin
Sug don't go for that
Check the skully with the cutty off dosha sacks
Forty racks

I'm not the average dude although I'm digging you
I can't be tied down now I deal in ho's and brew
Money is all I need, a backwood and a bag of trees
P-I-M-P is me your wildest dreams between the sheets
I got to have my dough, like you don't know what I'm here fo'
You got to break mines off, like I do you when I'm with you
On Cutty Bang and Smirnoff we'll do the thing and I'll show off
I can't be locked down now, that's not how I get down

The bitch is fatal
Plus she play all day like cable
I'm a pimp baby, I run a stable
I got H-O E-S's
High heels and cold gear is how she dresses
You too skrilla and I'm a true playa
You looking for a cuddle up, a Poo Bear
I need a bitch that's gonna move some work
Do some dirt, she can't then I ain't goosing her
I'm using her for her cards and her credit
She's breaded, super unleaded
Super saucy, super what you not
You need a man who ain't tripping off what you got
I'm too much meezy for one beezy
Plus, I like my nachos cheesy
That one on one shit, I can't go for that
I'm laid up with three bitches smoking fat

{Verse 1: Mac Dre}
I'm at the club, chipped up diamonds in my mouth
Collar flipped up on my Levi Strauss
When I leave thy house, boy I'm always dipped up
Me and Equipto at the bar gettin ripped up
Double shot Grey Goose dirty martini
I'm Al Boo Boo of the lamp, I'm the genie
Can't do the Chingy when I thizzle wiggle on 'em
Can't handle'em sick Drizzle on 'em
Man I'm too bad, going off two bags
Off Rappers Delight not the shit that you had
Don't funk push it partner I push it
I got that long on yah heads and I kush it
Push it push it real good I feel good
Kilo pass the Back so I can unpeel wood
I make hits, not pop flies
And wear more ice then boxers with black eyes
{Verse 2: Andre Nickatina}
Man I don't tell dem bitches that I'm goin to the party
Cause if I tell them bitches hoes will tell everybody
My Lexus just bought the Nakamichi
I'm in the shoe store trying gators when ya see me, you don't speak
I hit Vegas for a whole week
I'm trying to catch the tears that be comin' down my son's cheek
You praise Ron King I like Don King
I'm gettin money n' ain't even in the damn ring
I turn around like there's police sirens
I always tell broke bitches that pimps is hirin' now
So take a photograph
Or write a paragraph
The homie banging I can see cause he wear a flag
I hit the Energizer bunny with a Duracell
I hit Wilson's on time for the leather sale
I grab two blunts straight out the Swisher box
Gotta get the same rush a shooter gets from a Glock
My shoes match ma socks
I like to have a knot
My old crack neighborhood was called Bedrock
We like to fight back
You need to light that
This church preaching about the bible of a rap cat
I keep it moving like hoes that's choosing
Hittin' Privilege Hennessy wit em' all in the afternoon n'
I run through the city like it's grand larsony
Don't hit tha after party bitch whats stopping me?
I dress properly
Hoes try to copy me
I hang with pimps that say niggas neva knockin' me
I like to talk trash
Especially when I walk fast
Movin' through the airport with my blue polo bag

To this old-school sound with that K-Lou pound
It goes a 1-2-3, 3 to 2-1
Can't leave my house without packing my gun
I see
Niggas dying
Mamas crying
They sent cool back to jail
I said ""ugh, you lying""
Man, I hope they don't try to strike him out
Have him doing big time in Suzy's house
Hard times is coming to my town
Graduated from the pen, no cap and gown
Cuz back in '85, school was soup
I wanted Trues and Vogues, so I sold goop
Oops-up-side my head
Next thing I know, I'm doing time in the feds
Big spreads with macks and killas
415s and Black Gorillas
On the rilla, ugh, it's nothing pretty
Can't get caught slipping laying under the titty
Gotta be a savage, can't be no jerk
Boy, I do's dirt
And I'm a cold piece of work
You's a smirk
And you're scared to get down
You better do the hokey-pokey and turn yourself around clown
It's going down
I thought you smelled it
Niggas PH-ing and they just can't help it
I keep sucka reppellent
Cuz suckas is tellin
Hear it coming out they throat, I grab my coat and I'm bailing
Two years ago a cuddy of mine
Had to do some time 'cuz a nigga dropped a dime
I'm supa-sucka-free
And they can't fuck with me
Cuz I'm a R-O-M-P from the C-R-E-S-T
We gets dumb
You know how we come
Making up words like shitty-run-fun
Shitty-run-fun? Yeah, is you with me?
That's when your stomach is bubbling and your booty is drippy

California Livin,What’s Really Going On?,UnKnown,"Ah yeah, this is Mac Dre back in your face (California)
I got my homeboy Coolie in the place (California)
Kick back, let us tell you about..

This California lifestyle that I live
Zeus amps, Zap' board, highs and mids
Woofers in the truck straight slammin'
Striking through the neighborhood jammin'
Where you could drop the top, or blow the brains
Hit in the intersection and do some things
Passin' up folks with a gang of yolks
Smooth, thick legs, no pantyhose
Silky perms and dookie braids
Brothers with curls, some with fades
House parties rock, way past three
Players straight sip on Hennessy
High street chasers, Chevy races
Having sex in the strangest places
Nike shoes, Levi's jeans
Triple gold Daytons and straight-laced Zeens
Some on vocals, some only leads
Brothers like me rap to the beat
Dual exhaust, candy paint
Fat bank and gang a dank
Never on time, always late
On the Bay Bridge or the Golden Gate
If you wanna live on the best coast
You better try to move to the West Coast
Where 'Life is Too Short' and 'The Game is Thick'
Home of The Mac and the 'Groupie Ol' Chick'
Where brothers stay on the savage grind
Kick with a freak when they find the time
The C-A-L-I-F-O-R, N-I-A rap superstar
Dose for dose, I love to spit
And for the dank, I love to hit it
Hold it in, so it can choke me
And when I get dank, it will provoke me
To bust a rhyme, through the mike
A West Coast rap, the kind you like
From V-A-double L-E-J-O
Where makin' dope raps is all I know
Wake up in the morning, eat some grits
Hit the studio, make some hits
Now that you've been told about
What you rap fans get sold about
One million copies, or even more
I'm pumpin' dope rhymes to the record store
Yeah fool, you hear me spittin'
Tellin' you about that California livin'

(California livin')
(California livin')
Ah yeah, I got my boy Coolie in the house, he's finna bust one
Yeah, what y'all know about C-double O-L-I-O on this microphone? Goes like this...

Kickin' it tuff everyday, tryna make it through
Stackin' a bank, pullin' women and I take it you
Would wanna be down with this California lifestyle
Ruthless as a child, now I'm livin' wild
In the streets of California you better be packin'
And watch your back due to the fact there's jackin'
The wind breeze, blowin' through the trees
And I'm still gettin' tacked at a hundred degrees
Sides so hard on the avenue
From L.A. to the Bay, brothers stay comin' through
In Benzes, Porsches, Fives and things
Dropped Cougs, lit Chevs and whipped up 'stangs
Gold Daytons and Vogues, candy painting the kit
Fifth wheel, gold grill, boy, I'm talk about lit
Some of the baddest females ever seen
Straight California skanks, out for your green
In the Golden State, livin' way too real, fool
And if you soft, you best be cool
To the double R, all my time is givin'
Coolio and Mac Dre, California livin'
(California livin') (Repeat 4X)

Ah yeah, Mac Dre, we smooth California livin' on 'em (California livin')
(Mac Dre: What's up my Romp cuddies?)
(California livin')
We shooting to the T-O-P in the 9-O's
(Mac Dre: Livin' that California lifestyle, homeboy)
California livin'

California livin'
Ah yeah, that's dope
Check it out, let's put a little somethin' like this...
Somethin' like this, check it out...1-2-3-(3)

California livin' it up
Girls be givin' it up
Kickin' back on the track with a some Heem in your cup
It's a twelve-month party
So when you see me on stage with Lott and Marty
Get out your seat and feel the beat
And peel a freak and don't stop 'til Cease kills the beat
On the California coast we pop the most
And dose for dose and spit the dope
On the W-e-s-t C-o-a-s-t
It's young Mac Dre from the C-r-e-s-t
Down and dirty, doin' things that only players can do
Straight California livin' is what I'm sayin' to you
Ridin', sidin', whipin', dippin'
24/7, a brotha ain't trippin'
Mac Dre, the one you like to listen to
Nationwide and now I'm fixin' to
Put a little slang in the rap game
And come up strong for The Mac, mayne
(""Mac Dre, boy"") For The Mac, mayne

Cutthoat Soup,The Game is Thick Part 2,2004.0,"Uh
I'm always late, always on my way
Ain't enough hours in the day to be Dre
Cause in the Bay, things move fast
Stop to catch a breath, you might get passed
And that's yo ass, cause I'mma do it movin'
At 12 o' clock I'm supposed to meet Rubin
But I forgot, Rubin gotta wait
Cause I can't be late for me court date
For goodness sake I'm like ""what the fuck?""
I'm noddin' out, I'm sleep standin' up
If I don't go sit my black ass down
I'mma fuck around and, fall down
What the feezy who tryin' to call now?
Oh I forgot, I'm supposed to be at the mall now
I got in-sto', if they knew what they was in fo'
24 hours in a day I need ten mo'

Had to get clearance
Had to make sure it was cool first baby, the call from up top
??? is we cool?

I'm a federal hold nigga do shit that's unbail-able
Do it cutthoatish, unnoticed, untrailable
My bitch gon' make sure the funds are available
I'm a hot commodity, big business, I'm sellable
Infuckincredible, inedible
I'm married to the game so that makes unweddable
No wedding, no romantic setting
I mattress on the floor, no fancy bedding
Get it straight from the gate so you know where this thing is heading
Cold as the snow on the mountains of Redding
Everything she wanna do, I'm not letting
Work a race horse til her hair start shedding
I'm not regretting, the dirt I've done
A nigga wanna wet me I'mma squirt my gun
I need weed that's gon' hurt my lung
And chick with jaw that'll make me squirt my cum

I'm sorry to hear your situation has been worsening
Oh I can't complain, me myself personally
Tramp traffic is at all time high
I'm still stuntastic like I've been all my life
And how about wife, she's been hittin' me dog
I think she's considering gettin' me dog
She no longer cherish your marriage cause you financially embarrassed
Man I can take the bitch and go get mo' chips than Harrah's
No day off like Ferris, service is volunteer
By choice not force, it won't be no problems here
Man would guard your chick, she finna do somethin' slick
If she ain't ridin' mine she gon' be ridin' somebody else dick
Cause she tired of ya, done made a lie of ya
Toss her to a pimp, let me show you how I love her
I'mma get it out of her, every penny, every dolla
It's rent money, yanadadaholla

You lames missed it, got twisted like a pretzel
I'm a slick nigga cunning, gunning, running from the metro
I get so quick do it movin' bitch I'm federal
Respect it, connected get the stuff from the esé Pedro
I'm a pimp you, but you wouldn't know I dress retro
Breathe life in a ho lung, get her sprung so she can't let go
Shoulda bet mo', scary nigga I'm winner
Eat a nigga for dinner, game strong as paint thinner
If I can't send her, than pimpin', I don't need her
All I need is one mic, my money, and my heater
I steal clientele, short stop like Derek Jeter
I'm ill for my mail will pop out the two-seater
My mouth is too heated, I'm outlawed in a few states
I come through in somethin' ooh, cleaner than you with new plates
Y'all niggas is fruit cakes, same sex marriages
I'mma cutthoat with cutthettes, strapped with derringers

Yep, you right, nigga how you know
Man pimpin' had to let that bitch go
She a dime tryin' to steal my shine
Told that bitch take a number, get yo ass back in line
You wastin' my muthafuckin' time
I'm the biggest thang since Sprite put lemon with lime
Have you lost yo muthafuckin' mind
You must don't know, bitch I'm the kind

(Man it's cold)
It's cold as the Swiss Alps
The people get on me, than homie I switch routes
Mac Dre stay cussin' a bitch out
Quarterbackin', like Dan Fouts or Tim Crouch
I'm stuntin', watchin' my scritch sprout
Pourin' some Cris out, partna I'm pimped out
Colder than a blizzard in Alaska, or Mount Shasta
In a mask a blast ya, my car fasta, I strike past ya
12 Volt posi, cam and Flowmasters
Keep it to yo'self partna, who asked ya
I teach the game, a preach but no pastor
I'm cold",https://genius.com/Mac-dre-cutthoat-soup-lyrics

If it's gon' be a party, let me get the shit started, mayne (get the party started, mayne!)
Yadadameam? (yadadamean!)

Pass the boilermaker, and your toilet paper
I'm shittin' on fools, dope like a quarter caker
Or a acre, not a Celtic or a Laker
I'm a King, find me on Florin with a mouth full of bling
In something clean, doing MY thing
Nigga what you mean, I'm a legend like Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar, I screwed your broad
Snaked ya, 42 faked ya
Oops, fooled ya, boy
Who's ya boy? He's better of dead
Let that cat know he's in over his head
What? You ain't know? I'm mafia nigga
Got a nation of thugs that'll die for ya nigga
Ride for ya nigga, But, I need no mans
Wanna tango? Come on, nigga, we gon' dance
I'll do the Thizzle Wiggle, right on your face
Then throw you in the trunk with the bump and the base
(Hook 1 (by PSD))
Yadidamean, I'm Hotta Den Steam
Sharp as a crease, nigga, follow my teach
Bother me not, nigga, potna is mean

Bother me not, nigga, potna is mean

I'm prideful, pack a rifle, like Daniel Boone
Romper Room tycoon, best things since cartoons
And my platoon'll eat a nigga like shrooms
Goons, muggin' n' thuggin' from July to June
A gorilla do the baboon all in a womb
Find me flossin' on flyers that say ""Coming Soon""
I 'coon, nocturnal, love the moon
But we can meet in the middle of the street at high noon
And my beat goes boom, to concern may it whom
On this mic, I'll eat ya, no forks, knives or spoons
I sport Nike shoes, strike Gucci and Louie
From the Crest, on the best, light, sticky and gooey
Never fuck with the Chewy, but when I kick it with Dubee
We pop several Thizzes, ooh we get stuey
Shoo buh dee doo wop, doo buh dee doo
Mirror, mirror on the wall, tell me who be the fool?

Bother me not, nigga, potna is mean

Sharp as a crease, nigga, follow my teach
Bother me not, nigga, potna is mean
A prophet-like street hustla, nigga
Cutthoat heat tucka
(Verse 3)
The Feds watch me, like I'm a fuckin' Hitachi
But I got Lessons And Suggestions, like The RBL Posse
Protected by God, see, Them devils can't hurt me
And them haters get ate just like Thanksgiving Turkey
I'm a warrior, when I, come out and play
I do it like we do it, nigga, out in The Bay
Sideshow after every show, yokin' in a Chevy, ho
Seven seven Box, or a Glasshouse seven fo'
You never no, yo, I keep 'em guessin'
Strapped with a fat .40 Cal Smith & Wesson
For my protection, but nobody see it
'Til it's funk, when it's funk, punk I 3D it
Live N' Direct, I ride for respect
And I got prison tactics, catch a knife to the neck
Catch me in a 2 seater on Van Ness
Ridin' with my 2 heaters, who wan' come test?

Ah, what, ah, what
Mall Macenroe, like what!
Andre Macassi ah, ugh
Street Sampras, what it do?
What that is?
What it do?
Ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh

This ain't no love ballad, or romance song
This a dance song for you can get yo dance on
It's hard to keep my pants on when I'm giggin'
And when I'm giggin' it look like I'm diggin'
I do the pigeon, bird like a nerd
Some endlessly rappin' every line every word
I dust myself off like I stole third
Skinny nigga giggin' with no shirt
I get chauffeured so I can passenger gig
Get the chips and don't trip off her mask and her wig
So, son, I'm askin' her this: Can you do the thing?
Can you really do the dew and pursue the green?
I ask her who the king, she tell me I'm is
(Nothin' but the hook) It's almost time, kids
I'm tryna see some grindin', can you dig?
Yeah, you fine, bitch, but can you gig?

Baby, can you gig?
You so crazy when you gig
Ugh, she giggin'
Lady, can you gig?
Girl, you so crazy when you gig
Ugh, he giggin'

She was doin' the twist and pop
While I was tryna get the cork out the Cris then pop all in her hair
Her champagne shampoo was Flashdance 2
Baby want me to dance too but that I can't do
She was giggin' too hard for me
Turned around and my dick stretched a yard you see
I can't play wit you lil' mama, Thizzle got you crazy
Shocked her when I stood up and walked on her lazy
Broke it down, touched the ground; rolls wit the 80's shit
Lit that hazy, asked her ""What you know about Thizz?""
""What you know about this? Naw, bitch, Thizz""
'Cause that's what it is, DJ put us in the mix
Watch us pump up the party
'Cause we didn't come to body nobody
It's 300 Bay cats in the lobby
Swingin' dreads, movin' heads, getting' stupid
Naw, that's the old look, can gig to this new shit, watch me


I'm a fan of the Running Man, old school Cabbage Patch
Might mix The Prep wit a little Roger Rabbit
Robo-Cop, Up-rock, Pop-lock, Boogaloo
I don't know about you but where I'm from you see we act a fool
Lil' mama giggin' with me tryin' hard to keep up
But I'm bustin' moves that she never even heard of
Feelin' it, Thizz face look permanent
Advance Bird Dance now we call the shit ""The Buzzard"", bitch
Humpty Dance don't got nothin' on me
Quick to Michael Jackson spin and do the Mahoney
You squares is phony but your bitch still want me
'Cause I do the George Jefferson oh so coldly
Yeah, it's a celebration, bitch
So I'm gon' break it down to the Fred Sanford
Lil' mama movin' but you know she can't handle it
I'm in the middle of the floor with my hands on my dick",https://genius.com/Mac-dre-giggin-lyrics

You say ""hey! If I want Dre, I must first get in the Circle,""
""I heard he likes them half way dykes them Backwood blunts with purple""
First you get Rydah, said to keep this on the under
Scrolled through his fucking phone and got my beeper number
But the numbay was faultay, thats when you called up Kilo
Gave him some bombjaw, said keep this on the delow
Not knowing what was going on, Kilo called me from your phone
Now its on! Bitch you wrong, you won't leave me the hell alone

Leave me alone
Will you, bitch leave me alone
Can you, bitch leave me alone
Come on bitch, leave me alone

Thick thighs and some hips

Stupid Doo Doo Dumb,Stupid Doo Doo Dumb,1998.0,"Real big up in this bitch
Stupid doo doo dumb, gorilla milk in It
And I'm talking to you niggas that's happy
As a faggot in a tree full of dicks
It's one love, to nobody, what's really going on
One love to nobody, stupid doo doo dumb
We at the party, unnh, let's kill em off
Dre & Mall make a bitch cough

It started on a bright morning in 1997
I was in my SS Chevy y'all, I-80 doing one-eleven
Barking on my faulty phone, fresh new fit Maurice Malone
Burning tongue, feeling hella numb
Stupid doo doo dumb off 151
Honking at every ho that pass me
I'm hella nasty, boy, I need chassis
I'm the type of brother that'll fuck your mother
With a Magnum rubber and leave it on the cover
I won't love her, aw naw
All a nigga want is long jaw
It goes down where I'm from
How we come?
Stupid doo doo dumb

When your chassis getting nasty playing with her pearl tongue
Stupid doo doo dumb, stupid doo doo dumb
Four fingers in a pussy, cuddie, gone use your thumb
Stupid doo doo dumb, stupid doo doo dumb
When you're hitting it from the back and you smell sometin' sometin'
Stupid doo doo dumb, stupid doo doo dumb
Or when she's slurping on my dick and she starts to hum
Stupid doo doo dumb, stupid doo doo dumb

This is a brief description for those who don't know Dre
I'll go bad on bitches like that nigga OJ
Dick down broads and get blew at the telly
And don't see nothing wrong, like that fool R. Kelly
I serve cock like Julian St. Jox
Asshole naked getting blew in my socks
I'm the type of nigga that do thangs to thick dames
A super freak like that man Rick James
Adina Howard couldn't Freak Like Me
When I was in the pen, I used to beat my meat
But now I'm on the street hitting hella skins
Fuck a bitch so good she got to tell her friends
Tearing shit up making noise'n, with d-Con, that hoodrat poison
From city to city, town to town
Stupid doo doo dumb is how we get down

When you're in your own hood and they ask you where you're from
Stupid doo doo dumb, stupid doo doo dumb
Dick longer then my Caddy off 151
Stupid doo doo dumb, stupid doo doo dumb
Another hit of this shit and you gon' bust your lungs
Stupid doo doo dumb, stupid doo doo dumb
When the babby hella flammy, can't make a playa cum
Stupid doo doo dumb, stupid doo doo dumb

I'm hotter than fish grease, slicker than thick grease
A chump on the strap, I'll serve him a six-piece
Slick with this shit like spit on a gold tooth
Stupid Doo Doo Dumb, when I spit it's the cold truth
Crestsider, hoo rider, servin' on suckas who try to
Front with fake raps; man, I break backs
And I'll make snaps when I shake craps
Straight caps and lots of Bay game
'Cause it's a Bay thang with young Mac Dre, mayne
I say thangs that make your brain trip
Refrain from lame shit and some can't hang with
That game I bring and slang on dope tracks
I lace the lame and tame with ho slaps
I'm so fat, when I'm on the microphone
Stupid dumb making' em leave the mic at home

When you off dog food and your nose start to run
Stupid doo doo dumb, stupid doo doo dumb
Fuck your sister so good that your mammy got sprung
Stupid doo doo dumb, stupid doo doo dumb
Headers when I first met her, all teeth, no tongue
Stupid doo doo dumb, stupid doo doo dumb
Crestsiders in the house, punk bitch, we on one

Tell me you a baller but you ain't got a team
Can't break a bitch, no skill
Ho better bring me my pills
You can't play me with ya old Mercedes
Gotta give something for the grown man gravy
Hazy baby come with cabbage
Three new broads is a weekly average
A young mac know the dick to the purse
Hit it from the back
Climbing in reverse
She had high socks and skirt like a nurse
She wasn't that fine but it sure gets worse
Night start slow with a quick finish
Hash to the head with an Olde English
Wiggle what ya momma gave ya
Don't mind my behavior
Wiggle what ya poppa gave ya
Don't mind my misbehavior

Peep game, I'll start it like this
I'm nothin' fuckin' nice with the mic in my fist
Never slackin' when I'm mackin', get straight to the point
And always got my damn lighter to the mothafuckin' joint
Mac Dre, dope as you ever knew
Taxin' muthafuckas like Internal Revenue
Knockin' 'em out the box like it ain't no thang
Suckas can't hang with the way I swang
Ryhmes flow smooth like milk fom a cup
Straight cussin' when I'm bustin' don't be givin a fuck
'Cause there's no room for weak and soft ones
Square muthafuckas end up lost ones
I'm the type of brotha that you don't wanna see
Mobbin on the S T A G E
Doper then a joint of that D A N K
Got more soul then Kunta Kinte
Young playa, down for the mail
Even bustin' tapes when they put me in jail
Straight, from the C E double L
Nevertheless, funky fresh, boy I'm never stale
Pumpin' your brain up with game gettin' groovy'en
Doper then a key of that pure Peruvian
Uncut, dope as x-rated
Some hate it 'cause they can't relate
But I'm takin' out every time
'Cause sucka, slayin is a full time job
Not one to brag, but to tell you the truth mayne
I'm funkier than a locker room after a hoop game
To put it to you straight, I'm one nice dream
I'll make your brain, melt like ice cream
Given it to you just the way you like to be gave to
You never hear Dre do or say what they do
'Cause I'm no biter, I'll just write a
Rap that caps on a young sucka that might a
Step outta line, dissin' a ryhme
Becomin' Mac Dre is like committin' a crime
I'll best the rest, but test the best
But nevertheless the funky fresh, rizaps
Makin' lots of snizaps
Suckas try to hang, I'll make a tape fizat
But some take no ?, try to throw those
Slightly dope raps but I just show those
Suckas sudden death, I never slowly kill
Knockin' 'em off the box like Evander Holyfield
I can't be touched when I'm on the microphone
I'll make sucka MC's leave the mic alone
One by one, they all bow down
And get riggidy romped out to this Mac Dre sound
Sometimes I cuss but whenever I bust
I keep the fans geeked and they can't get enough
Like a dope fiend hooked on the glass pipe
Or an alchoholic hooked on the ack-right
My raps make love to your ear hole
It's the diggity dope shit you love to hear, ho
I'm in motion

Saucy, yes I got flava
When I'm fuckin' it up man nothin' can save ya
Droppin' the funky shit like a A double S hole
Romper room soldier comin' straight from the Crest ho
Hotter then hot sauce, love the cock soft
Bitches get sprung when I'm gettin' my rocks off
'Cause I'm not the type that be bustin' quick ones
I like to get the cock in all positions
From the back, or with the bitch on top
With young Mac Dre, mayne, it just don't stop
There ain't a piece of pussy that I can't get
Hoes on my dick like stank on shit
They just love they way, I T-A-L-K
Your so saucy, Is what they tell Dre
Then ten minutes later they be wantin' to G this
Jealous muthafuckas be hatin' to see this
Player haters try, to salt me up
Doin' punk shit, to fault me up
But the bullshit don't faze me
She's still sprung, and she still pays me
With the quickness, she ain't hesitant
Given up them dead presidents
That lovey dovey shit I just can't get with
I charge hoes for this black big dick
Fly young tenders with lots of green
Be kickin' me down like a slot machine
Breakin' me off somethin' more than proper
Young Mac Dre's a cold cash clocker
Not the type of brother that be tastin' hoes
I'm the type of nigga that be lacin' hoes
'Cause a bitch ain't nothin' but five letters
She don't kick down, then I sweat her
Mack the bitch, crack the bitch, break her
She won't pay then mayne I shake her
'Cause money makes the world spin
Fuck a wife and a girlfreind
It's all about S-N-A-P-S
A bitch thats broke, just ain't fresh
Some niggas think they gotta pay
Fuck that shit, not Mac Dre
I'll tell 'em like this, it costs to toss me
'Cause ain't no bitch, that damn saucy

Don’t Snitch,Ronald Dregan: Dreganomics,2004.0,"Man... I'm through fuckin' around
You niggas keep on ya gon' be duckin' some rounds
I'm rushin' the mound, bitch done hit me with a pitch
He a snitch and he walk with a switch
He in a band that sing for the cops
Him and his mans, they cleanin' up shop
Undercover concert promotor
Ricky Schroder tryin' to turn somebody over
Put that E.T. finger up, you stooley
Don't tattletale, the number one ruley
You the jumpest, the boys, them people
Slipped in the game, sellin' toys to people
I avoid them people, don't ask me shit
The only law I break is in public, grip
My mouth zipped, I plead the 5th
And niggas like you get pushed off a cliff

I’m on to you boy you used to be the man
Till I caught you in the courtroom sitting on the stand
Got the wave in your hand, & pointing your finger (who you pointing at?)
Holding the mic like some type of rap singer
I seen you, you told & now you gotta live with it
They gone gitcho & probably say that pigs did it (I ain’t did shit)
Fuck you, fuck who you been to, fuck what you going thru, & fuck where you been
Consider this a warning to you cats out rapping (all you niggas)
The streets get ugly when a drive by happens (you heard that homie?)
You rap niggas out here starving for fame (better cut that nigga loose)
Better watch who you fuck with, a scar on your name
My young nigga locked up, ball & chain
& y'all niggas acting like it’s all in the game (it don’t work like that)
I hear niggas on the street wanna blast this bitch (go & get him)
& when it happens? Don’t ask me shit

You can line 'em up and put twelve in a box
And find out your boy is workin' with the cops
Doin' flip-flops, the Rover rollin' over
The Tootsie Roller, scared to do a quarter
It's October and he can't be gone 'til November
So he's givin' up the gang, every damn member
Everything he remember - he's tellin'
He get out of jail free, ain't no bailin'
He's no felon, he's no misdemeanor
He got a target melon and a E.T. finger

Quit peepin' at my Beamer, tryin' to watch me

Get ho bucks man so much I ran game and pimped her

Davins, and choppers there's no stoppin Mister

Hard to find, you might not find one like me anywhere
You can search tall trees, the bottom of the seas
Nigga please, they don't make them like these
Huh what you say, you gone do what?
I murder, get further, in my coughnut
Geeks I chew up, in the streets I grew up
I run with niggas that'll peel a nigga for a few bucks
I'm sewing thangs up, got the game on lock
Give you an E for effort, but it ain't no knock
Man this thang don't stop, I'm all night like Denny's
I'm countin' thow-wows while you scrapin' for pennies

I'm always digging in her bra and getting hella loot
Whats happening? I'm Mac Dre the bitch wetter
And pimping is one of the many ways I get cheddar
On a bitch back like a thick sweater
You know I represent that 16th letter
The P, pimping, West Coast pimping
Pockets so fat the motherfuckas got me limping
It's in my blood, I'm a Mac from birth
A West Coast cutthroat from the turf
I'm in her purse more than she be
That's his wife but I be fucking more than he be
I go gorilla, that's on the real'a
And the Pittsburg I know don't got no Steelers
It's nothing new, we old school like retro
And this gangsta mac shit on this West Coast

 (Repeat 3X)
(Straight)
 West Coast
(Straight gangsta mac but sometimes I...)

I'm a gangsta mac, I'll break a batch
Send a hoe for the dough, Yuk make her fetch
Bring it back like we playing catch
A trick dry slurps licks, guns to your head like playing roulette
Pimps follow me copying what I do next
With the coupe on 22's and knock a new bitch
Yellow and blue wrist, yellow and blue kicks
I used to move bricks and make 'em do flips
Now, I pimp bitches that's in porno movies
While a model bitch feeding me sushi rocking Gucci
I rock the Louis, model or a groupie
You wanna fuck with Yuk, bitch socking it to me
I'm into jewelry, bitch, ice my wrist up
Put her on the internet and the strip club
And I met her in the strip club
Now she fucking with a rich thug, Yuk stay chipped up, what!


On Chevy you should see the guts in him
And he cut to fit the 26-inch rim (Dayuumm!)
3-51, you should see when it passed ya
Pushing on your gas but he's a little bit faster

Back To My Mission,The Musical Life of Mac Dre Vol 3 - The Young Black Brotha Years: 1996-1998,1996,"Yeah
I feel ya
I don't know what to say
That's how it's going down?

Woke up one mornin 'bout 6 o'clock
Dick still smellin' like spit n cock
Beeper vibratin' like a nympho sex toy
It's time to collect, them hoes got they checks boy
But on my way out the motel room the bitch said
'Dre, why must you go so soon'?
Thinkin' about the night before and how she licked me
I bounced back in so I could get me a quicky
Dick hard as ten pounds of frozen neckbones
I got my wreck on and got the heck on
Droppin' a ho off, you know I had to show off
I burnt rubber and the bitch tried to go off
But all I did was laugh, like she was a joke
Hit the gas, and left her ass in smoke
Strikin' in my Chevrolet you know I had to smash it
Dippin' and dodgin', makin' my way through traffic
Marily marily, marily marily I go
Looked in the rearview, damn
It's 5-0
Once again pullin' me over for the jack up
In my mirror I can see him callin' back up
But I ain't goin' out like no sucka
Put the pedal to the metal and smoked the mothafucka
Stopped at the store on Sacramento and Tennessee
Got a pack of zig-zags and a fifth of hennessy
Percin' off the dank and the drank connection
It's back to my mission nigga, bank collection
Back to my mission
Back to my mission
Back to my mission

Rollin' in my old school Lincoln, drinkin'
Joint between my lips and I'm dankin', sinkin'
Deep in the seat, with the beat on the down-low
But I ain't trippin' on the way it really sound though
I got down ho, ready to hit the track
And bring back fat stack of them greenbacks
Hit the stroll but before I let her go
I let her know, she's nothing but my ho
4 was the time on my wristwatch
Grabbed my phone, turned it on, cause I just got a motherfuckin
Beep from a freak on another strip
Get the hennessy and I take me another sip
Call the bitch back and she's ready, to kick down
What she made, from just gettin' dick down
Bounce to the spot where my ho does work
See her in a skirt and a see-through shirt
Pull her off the track and I don't say shit
Cause all I wanna hear is that purse unzip
Lookin' at the bitch with the pimpish grin
Feelin like the mac as my ho kicks in
Let the bitch out, start unloadin' my cut
Let the 15's slam and I'm fuckin em up
They can't understand how I bounce my head
Smokin' on a joint at a light that's red
Niggas can't be me but they wish they could
The light turned green and I hit the hood
See my homeboy Don in a '74
The rollers got him jacked but they lettin' him go
Catch up with him up at the light
Said 'what's up cuddie, where they at tonight'?
He said 'it's goin on playa at the afterdark
And there's a house party bumpin in college park'
Playa waved to my homie then I split from the scene
It's back to my mission nigga, gettin' the green
Back to my mission
Back to my mission

Late one night, I drove my Brome to the burger spot
Stepped in all I saw was a herd of cock
Went in my pocket, came out with the yack bottle
Twist the cap then I took me a fat swallow
All I could smell was cock in the air
And I can tell by they stare they was jockin' the playa
Went to the counter ordered burger and milkshake
The girl standin' behind me was thick with silk fake
Hair that looked the real but she had looks to kill
I Stepped back and gave the broad my spill
Told her my name and she couldn't believe dat
Kept spittin' game til I peelt her weave back
She recognized the playa and she knew I was major
Gave her the number to my Pactel pager
Snatched my grub, then I hopped in my town car
And let them landstars slam, and pound hard
Honked at the hutch when I cut from the scene
Then it's back to my mission nigga
Gettin' the green
Back to my mission
Back to my mission",https://genius.com/Mac-dre-back-to-my-mission-lyrics

Got one pill left and she askin' me split it
I ain’t wit it. Where I’m goin’? Bitch, why?

Bitch, why? Die, choke on sulfa
My niggas in the back tryna smoke on sulfa
Fa sho’ gon’ stuff a dub in the ‘wood
Now it’s me, M.D., PSD, and Shug
I’m feelin’ good, ugh, got a hoe on jock

Be careful when they roll through and half of ‘em total

Conversate a bitch and make her bob
Accept bread off top, touch the man and re-cop, it don’t stop
Me and my Thizz niggas, we rowdy
Bad Business is bout it

It was me, J.D. and Black Jesus
Goin’ to the store to bring back a juice
So we can get to pillin’ and feelin’ it, man
Giggin’ hella hard and start killin’ it, man
We ill in a van, Chevy, 20
Fat backwood, never skinny
Icon Nikes on my feet
And I come hyphy on my beats
She wear cleats ‘cause she’s in the game
An all-star legend in the Jaw of Fame
If it’s all the same I think I’ll pass
She got lotsa ass but, no cash
And I need cash like a car needs gas
If you don’t got it, get far, quick fast

Rollers caught me slippin', took a dive in the game
Caught five and some change, shipped to high desert
That's when I met him, this nigga Edgar
This nigga Edgar was cool, soon became my relly
We formed a tight bond, he was more than a celly
Shared with him pictures of me wife and kids
It wasn't no thang, shit, he showed me his
Didn't know he was a fake, a cheesecake
But the story unfolds on Edgar's release date
Edgar went to my house, bumped my bitch
Slept in my bed, and played with my kids
Ain't that a bitch? - I didn't trip, have fun
Just let me talk to my daughter, and my son
Edgar said, 'Dre, they don't love you no more
And I don't think you really should be callin' no more'
Oh no, I'mma have to murder
My dear wife, I'mma have to hurt her
It was a cold gloomy day when I got parole
Caught my man with the powder then I scored me some blow
Then I sat and I drank, got high as Eddie Kane
Prayed to the Lord and went and got my thang
Went to this fool house, in my pick-up
The kids get out at 2:00, someone will have to pick up
Then sure enough, up they rolled
Never in my life has my blood ran so cold
I didn't care, nor did it matter

, my posse like Nazis
I call shots like Gotti, my designated hitters catch bodies
Crestland mad man, cutthroat kamikaze
Sicko, schizo, 
sneak Tommys in the party
And when the funk pop off, squares already know who shot him
Them boys slidin’ back to the Triple C on posi
Me see Sawyer Street like Big Daddy and Collie
And quick stretch a fly bitch out like Pilates
Chassis think a Mac spittin’ drag, then bitch try me
I’ll have you in Miami gettin’ a couple grand nightly
This some of that Thizz grill, battlefield, Country Club Mac spill
Come against my side and mayne, fa sho, catch a raw deal
For trill, cutt, pass the bomb kill
And I’ma steal on any off-ramp tryna wreck what we build
Nigga, this Mac da Mos, one toke overdose
You suckas can’t come close
And if they do, caps get peeled, for real

They on it, they want it, these niggas ask for it
Shit hit like George Foreman, one dose and you’re soarin’
Cuddies buy rope by the pound, we never come down
Rip to trip or whoop a clown, never come down
They on it, they want it, these niggas ask for it
Shit hit like George Foreman, one dose and you’re soarin’
Cuddies buy rope by the pound, we never come down
Rip to trip or whoop a clown, never come down

If I ain’t drunk now, I’m finna be
I’m full of the Remy, ready to engage the enemy
Push the extremity, hear me, and don’t let up
Use his bitch to set up, and then wet up
Nigga, shut up, you ain’t got my mail yet
Get hit with the Kel-Tec, with the shell-catch
My bitch mail-fetch, sell sex, she rich
I check ill traps and will slap the bitch
So cold, my little niggas from the North Pole
Put ya in a chokehold and shoot up your Ford Probe
A fly force, we a mobile strike force
Put 365 course in a tight Porsche
When my source gives me the coordinates
I sic ‘em, get ‘em, hit ‘em with the pair of ordnance
You insubordinates get the cutthroat guillotine
Ya-da-di-mean? Nigga, this the killa team
They on it, they want it, these niggas ask for it

They on it, they want it, these niggas ask for it

It’s Rainin’ Game,The Best of Mac Dre Volume Two,1997.0,"Rain on ‘em

…Or the other side of town…
It’s rainin’ game in Northern California
I’ll see you when I get there

Hopped out the shower, turned on the beat and started jammin’
Put on my Pelle Pelle shirt made by Marc Buchanan
I’m slammin’ Sugawolf ‘cause he be a straight hog
Put on my Abercrombie coat to cope with the Bay fog
I stay sharp, my job is peelin’ them top notches
I got beyotches and Mac Driggedy stays cautious
Gotta watch they every move ‘cause dude I gots to warn ya
It’s rainin’ game up in Northern California
I’m extra flossy and saucy so I pops collars
Clocks dollars, and boy, I squats Impalas
Pullin’ up on bitches, I’m off the hinges, I likes to clown
Better get your sponge, it’s comin’ down in the town

It’s rainin’ game in Northern California
They tell me…
It’s rainin’ game in Northern California
They tell me…
It’s rainin’ game in Northern California
They tell me…
It’s rainin’ game in Northern California
Ooh ooh

We got that sauce like boss playas, we floss the cleanest
Pushin’ them Daytons, and some of us roll on Zeniths
Straight lace triple gold, it’s difficult not to jock
She’s lookin’ famous, so you know I gots to knock
Gotta peep the scene though ‘cause with these hoes you might get played
By one of them broads wearing weaves, bobs or braids
It’s rainin’ game in the North, dude, it’s so flooded
And all this game that we pour, ooh, is cold-blooded
But they love it, and always want more of it
Hear me servin’ it on tape and then they can’t wait to dub it
I shove up in your ear like a Q-Tip then you get to geekin’
For the words I’m speakin’ you tweakin’ for the game I’m leakin’, boy

It’s rainin’ game in Northern California
That’s what they tell me
It’s rainin’ game in Northern California
They tell me...
It’s rainin’ game in Northern California
They tell me...

Well, it may be cold on the East Coast or the other side of town
But this is the Bay
Ooh ooh

You might get hurt when you in that Bay, so my trigger finger stays itchy
I love to perk when I’m around the way 
and I’m a Seasoned Veteran like Richie
Rich
, of course, and I spit with force, and I’m sho’ nuff full of that game
And that North Pole, Valley Jo, Country Club Crest I claim
See, in the Bay, we like to ball, and players like me stand tall
You might catch me on I-80 in the Bay on my way to the mall
‘Cause I love to shop, chase cot, 
game more potent than a base rock
Love to side when I ride but the tires won’t slide if it ain’t hot
So I stay seated in a Chevy that’s heated and really there’s no trip needed
Although you do look good, girl I never would eat it but will beat it
Conceited, yes, and need a fresh top notch on my team
So trip, stack and then kicks back, and listen to the homeboy sing

It’s rainin’ game in Northern California
I wanna be right there with you
It’s rainin’ game in Northern California
There’s nothin’ else I’d rather do
It’s rainin’ game in Northern California

Game,16 Wit’ Dre,2006.0,"(feat. Mac Dre)

Serving fat game that you'll never imagine
Boy I can talk a cat off a fish wagon
Or sell an Eskimo ice at a high price and get him twice
Man I not that nice, and games my merchandise
I grime rhymes like bass rocks a ""89""
Lacing young playas getting ready for shady times
No shady rhymes you're garented to love it
And since I got so much of it, its gonna cost to dub it
So get ya scrilla, ya fetti, ya scarth, and yo mail
And holla at me folks, I got game for sale

Mothafuckas jock me cuz I'm dope when I be flowing
Suckas try to stop me, but im honking keep on going
Im simply not the type that likes to kick it with a square
I kick it with the bitch cuz filthy rich cuz im gone play here
Time and time again man niggas always ask me
Why do hoe's jock you when you spit raps so nasty
I look them in the eye and I reply to the question
Game is to be thought so let me teach yo ass a lesson
Bitches love niggas who can pop a lot of shit
Sprung off the tongue so they jock for the dick
I never met a broad who didn't like the way I laced her
Poured this hoe some game and served this pimpin as a chaser
Fools can't understand about the shit I teach in a verse
Rapping about that bitch and how she reached in her purse
It takes a true playa to really recognize
Its all about the money not the shit between the thighs
Suckas love pussy more than money cuz they show it
They eat it and retreat and they even pay for it
I truly don't know why those fools be salting up the game
Real niggas pimp but you don't here me man
I know this mothafucka who won't hesitate to hit a bitch
A right to the jaw is what I saw when he got with his bitch
Showing no mercy for those hoes who be flossing
Acting like they all that when they only good for tossing
I feel the same way about those bitches that be faking
Hoes ain't shit unless they bringing home the bacon
And if its like that then I act like I love the ho
But when im not with her man I dicking down another ho
Playas know that I flow is nothing but that real shit
Fuck those faking broads man get you a real bitch

I don't be bull shiting with the game that im spittin
So pay attention to this game that you getting
Its kind of foul but some say wow
But I be serving it real the only way I know how

As I put don't this demo know you when you I hear no
Sucka shit out these lips but I bet you'll hear mo
Styles and techniques shit to catch freaks
If ya lacking macking homeboy you best beat
I serve it the right way, those broads who like Dre
Im giving baby action if im thinking she might pay
I might play, with the body and soul
And have her doing every got damn thing she told
I manipulate than stipulate
The rules then I use every grip she makes
Im a playa in this game but professional
And if you ain't shit bitch im going to let you know
Then im gone let you go ho cuz I don't need ya
Take them, break them, shake them
Is a pimp's procedure
Simps they feed ya be glad they g'd ya
Im going to seet back and analyze and read ya
Peeps potentials read percentiles
Then run a player check on your freak condenses
No time to play games with broads who say thangs
Its realer and I tell the bitch the shit the Dre brings
Is realer then Swiss cheese
Im out to get geez, if you ain't with it
Punk bitch then get these nuts in your mouth
No more no less
You fucking around with that pimp playa crest


Spittin that real shit ya know

All I Want To Do,Al Boo Boo,2003.0,"I'm into parties that don't end at four
Bitches that keep lingerie in their drawer
Back in '84 I swore
To peel straight dimes, no more twos or fours
Not looking for ""My Cherie Amour""
I'm a mack, I pimp whores, got CD's in stores
I'm hardcore like the almighty Thor
Campaign with this game man, like Al Gore
Drink Mickey's not Coors, no sticky pot wars
Got wounds and sores, boy I been through wars
I want to party until I fall to the floor
Get drunk, pass out, then snore
Mrs. bartender come pour me some more
What no more? Fuck you, up yours!
I'm into whores that wear Christian Dior
No pimples or clogged up pores
I don't bark, I roar, catch me on tour
In a velour, ho's screaming for more
Fuck it, you want me to come with some more whores?
Or cutthroat up and take this shit outdoors?

All I ever want to do is party
Catch me at the club trying to holler at somebody
I'm rolling with the bumps in the trunk
Trying to have fun 'cause you only live once
All I ever want to do is party
Catch me at the club trying to holler at somebody
I'm rolling with the bumps in the trunk
Trying to have fun 'cause you only live once

See them other niggas be mean mugging
Catch me MD on the scene bugging
Hanging out the hole in my groove
Sun shining off the diamonds on my tooth
Man, I'll tell you the truth
Rapping to you is like selling you some food
I'm dope, like a pound or a key
Look what they done found in the V
MD, Ew-we, rolling like Bart or a SUV
My things got spin wheels that spin like pinwheels
Might be getting fucked with the hutch she in heels
Play infield, outfield and pitcher
I'm an all around player, nigga I'll hit ya
Get with ya? I'd rather have fun
'Cause it's no fun, being on the run
And that's what I'm finna be, get from in front of me
And quit acting like a thug you fucking wannabe
Pop a pill and wake up nigga, you'll never be like us

All I ever want to do is party
Catch me at the club trying to holler at somebody
I'm rolling with the bumps in the trunk
Trying to have fun 'cause you only live once
All I ever want to do is party
Catch me at the club trying to holler at somebody
I'm rolling with the bumps in the trunk
Trying to have fun 'cause you only live once

""Funky Cold Medina"" have you seen her?
She be with Tina, drive a green beamer
I be seeing her at every function
I'm trying to get her to uh, suck something
Put something in that jaw
I'm not interested in her friend at all
Kinda slim and tall, I need 'em short and thick
Not some dumb unfortunate
I need it big, I mean bigger
Not that big, bitch watch your figure

All I ever want to do is party
Catch me at the club trying to holler at somebody
I'm rolling with the bumps in the trunk

Back N Da Hood,Back N Da Hood (2005),UnKnown,"Another sleepless night in Fresno Jail
I got a federal hold and I can't even bail
Eyes wide open like a dope fiend geeked
I need some cock hella bad, I need to be free
Steady dreaming about wrecking guts and cock
Laying on my bunk busting nuts in socks
Celly on top bunk knock smooth out
Snoring mothafucka, I should just shout
And wake his ass up cause I can't sleep
If a nigga had a way, a nigga would creep
And make a clean break but that's just a dream fake
This can't be real, man, it all seems fake
3 am and it's time to E-A-T
Cold cream of wheat and a lunch in a B-A-G
This shit is the pits, man, how worse will it get, man
I need to be N Da Hood, straight getting a grit, man...
I'm missing the crew, the dope fiends too
I'm writing this rap, there's nothing else to do
Cause home is a place that it seem I won't go
Sleeping in a cell with some fools I don't know
Dope fiends that just don'y got no...
Sense and fince to get shipped to Wasco
I'm stuck like chuck way down south
When I need to be at home with a joint in my mouth
Smoking and choking on some hurt cha dick weed
I just can't wait to straight perk and get key'd
I need to be N Da Hood straight swinging tight ones
Burning long rubber on the black and white ones...
Back N Da Hood sound so good
They won't set bail but I wish they would
I P-R-A-Y every D-A-Y
Asking to get back to the B-A-Y
But every court date they keep detaining me
On punk ass charges they keep arraining me
At first I thought I'd have to spank you
But Detective Nichleman, I'd like to thank you
You put me on the news and tried to spread that lie
Then record sales jumped to an all time high
Why rob a bank when a nigga can spit?
I need to be N Da Hood cause I ain't did shit
Every damn day my tapes are sold
I make more money than the bank can hold
And though I might can't bail out...
This punk ass jail house
I'll just kick back and watch my mail sprout...
Plenty of time for a nigga to think
But all I can think of is dank and drank
On jail walls my name is carving
Waiting on comissary, man, I'm starving
Ten black brothas and fifty julios
I just can't wait to hit the studios
And let fools know about the set up
These punk police won't let up
They trying to keep me down and keep me in a ditch
But the only thing they doing is making me rich
They painted a picture of a ruthless villain
Told all my fans that I was stealing
Jealous mothafuckas, I never steal
I make more money than you never will
Mac Dre arrested for attempted heist
The mothafucking feds ain't nothing nice
They said I was the one doing all this shit
But banks just keep on getting hit
Feds trying to send a nigga up the creek
But Dre ain't worried cause the case is week
They say I'm the one calling all the shots
But fuck them feds and fuck them cops
And to that punk mothafucka Detective Nic Dic
Hear me loud and clear, fool: suck my big dick!",https://genius.com/Mac-dre-back-n-da-hood-lyrics

Stop—I can't take no mo'
Why is the police steady knockin' at my do'?
24-7, the devils be trippin'
They say some banks was robbed and I fit the description
But that's drama, so save it for your mama
I'm not criminal minded, punk police, I'm a
Dope rhyme dealer, not a money stealer
Was real in '91, but now I'm much realer
On the streets you roam, tryna follow me home
Steady runnin' checks, on me and my Brougham
You see my mother is worried, you got her vision all blurry
You throwin' darts at my partner's poster - and he's buried?
Restin' in peace, but you won't give him no peace
Man, you punk police, I'm not the savage beast
You labeled us a ruthless G-A-N-G
But the biggest gangsters are on the VPD
They hate to see me drivin' a car I bought
They hate how I talk, I can't spit on the sidewalk
They roughin' and cuffin' me, in jail they be duffin' me
Every damn day, mayne, they can't get enough of me
I could maybe understand if I was breakin' the law
And I'mma dedicate this to Detective McGraw
You be steady accusin', but these cases you losin'
You be steady abusin', mayne, do you find it amusin'?
Well, haha, haha, I'mma laugh in your face
While you kick on back and feel the bass
Punk police with a one-track mind
Man, you can't even find who's been robbin' you blind
It got deep, so you had to blame somebody
What's next—you gon' frame somebody?
You gon' frame somebody?

Is you gon' frame somebody?

For the dumb punk one-time I've got one rhyme
You can't stop sweatin' me, no, not even sometime
You fuss and cuss at, would love to bust at
A brother like me, always searchin' my nutsack
'Punk Police' I named this cut
And punk police, I'll tell you what
You need to stop trippin' and cold do your job
Stop tryna be ruthless and stop tryna mob
Punk police are nothin' clean
Look how they did Rodney King
In every neighborhood, state, city, and town
A crooked policeman can be found
Off-duty he never would squab hard
But give him that gat, badge and that squad car
Then it's jack time, fuck-with-a-black time
I'm talkin' real, man, listen to a Mac rhyme
Listen to a Mac rhyme

Punk police, punk police, punk police, punk police, punk police
Punk police, punk police, punk police, punk police

And it don't stop, and it don't quit
Punk police can't tell me shit
I'm just a Romp star goin' to the top far
You can't stop me strikin' in my Cadillac car
Straight doin' it, straight doin' it
Romper Room crewin' it, Romper Room crewin' it
I can't stop doin' it, can't stop doin' it

Then jump in a five-point-O leavin' the block smoky

Smokin' a bounce of that bombay every day

We can old school with a zag or blow bags in the billy
Is you silly, never throw the doobie away
Waste no dank when you're blowin' with Dre
Tryin' to cope with the stress so I blow big
How can a bulletproof vest protect my wig?
See, them cutthroat fools done changed the rules
The public got it twisted and we blame the news

And err body know I turn out the party
Catch me at Vlade's, in the Tunnel
Drinkin' like a fish, mouth like a funnel

Pocket full of money, my bitch is ready to hoe
Bring daddy dough is all they wanna do
Why fuck the bitch when you'll pay her to fuck you
Pawns slide through, I'm with a chosen few
Fifth’d up, feeling like vapors, I’m chipped up
Pull the 6 up, got ‘em lookin' like ‘whoa’
‘Is it paid for?’ It's all on a hoe


Give me a OPD with err thang on it (all of it)

Cut the crap, biatch; you can't con me
I'll slice yo' ass thin as salami
Not Ronnie, Bobby, Ricky or Mike
I go bad like OJ, sav like Ike
Gesundheit, so cold, you sneeze
Iced out grill, tattooed sleeves
Bitch please, me no comprende
All I understand is 'daddy, send me'
I drink Rémy Martin
Flows on a cougnut, barking
Old school nigga like Theodore
When I see a whore, I can't ignore
I'm all in her face like an angry coach
Servin' her potions and antidotes
Hop in the Range when it's time to go
She'll do whatever I say, she'll even be my hoe

Mackin' ain't nothin but a thing to me
'Cause I'm a double OG P-I-M-P

Yep, A-B-C-P

Pimpin's been around since the first day
And I been utilizing my mack hand, swingin' my back hand
Checkin' bitches on the daily, fuckin' with my paper route
If you's a broke bitch, best'a get the fuck out
No disrespect but I'm a mack, that's how the game go
Pimpin' these hoes from Hunters Point to Fillmore
Mac Dre and 4-Tay keep it sucka-free
360 degrees, you feel me, Suga Free?
Dirty dead presidents
Put a safety deposit box at my residence
'Cause real playas stack a grip, can't be hesitant
Maneuver on my cellular
100, 100, 100 mo' profit on the regular
Droptop double-R's, stackin' like Escobar
Gotta get that cheese, Cali niggas do it all
You need garage door opener, haters glancin'
Keepin' the feds off balance, they can't find my mansion

Mackin' ain't nothin but a thing to me

Miss You,Thizzelle Washington,2002.0,"(I’m gonna miss you in the morning)
I know, baby (I’m gonna miss you in the morning)
Baby, I know—I’ll be back
For real, I’m coming back
I’ll be back
I’ll be back

How you doin’, baby? I’m Thizzelle
Old school dope game like Troops and Gazelles
Who from Vallejo, Crestside Cali
Where niggas stack scrill, mac beals like Ally
Don’t Berry like Halle, we Barry like Bonds
We don’t make hits, we make homeruns
Out the park and, bitches on Larkin
Cougnut barkin’, swing it and I park it
Hit yo’ apartment, on the late night
Just suck me, fuck me, make sure I ate right
I guess it’s the dick, when I give you the dick
You go buck louie, get stewie stupid dick
Plumber, pipe layer, Mr. Roto-Rooter
Fuck you like a player, smoking on a hooter
Put on my clothes, be on my way
You look at Dre and say…

(I’m gonna miss you in the morning)
I know, baby; I’ll be back
(I’m gonna miss you in the morning)
I’ll be back
I’ll be back
I said I’d be back

You never met a nigga like Dre before
That been doing player shit since ‘84
Don’t believe me? Trump adds the ratio
I don’t chase the hoe, I replace the hoe
All on a bitch like Leon Phelps
I’m trying to get rich, and if she don’t help
The bitch get benched like a pitcher in a slump
You wanna chip in? Let me get you in some pumps
I do my thang, you do yo’ thang
You don’t even got to be no pimp and hoe thang
We can do the thang like Clyde and Bonnie
Let me put you in a Benz, get you out that Omni
We can get down on sandy beaches
Sippin’ on wine, eating on peaches
Lav lav lovely when you fuck with Mac Dre
And every time I leave, you have to say…

(I’m gonna miss you in the morning)
I know, I know
(I’m gonna miss you in the morning)
I’ll be back
(I’m gonna miss you in the morning)
I know, I know
(I’m gonna miss you in the morning)
I’ll be back

Yeah, bitch
I know you tryna kick it with a player, all that shit, right?
But I gotsta go

(I’m gonna miss you in the morning)
(I’m gonna miss you in the morning)
(I’m gonna miss you in the morning)
(I’m gonna miss you in the morning)
Part 2
All right…yep…mmm-hmm…I’m retchy

Back to the pimpin’ at hand
I’ll stalk a hoe, and shit on a man
I’ll make bitches climb high trees to get away from this pimpin’
I’ll make a bitch run—I’ll run slough who, annie roo
The first Kentucky Derby—
Nigga, I’ll get a bitch faster than Jesse Owens out there on the track when she see a mac comin’
Get so quick, bitch, when you see this

What’s really? My name is Furl
Back in the days, used to slang girl
Have a S-Curl, a yes curl
And at the same time, Jiggy had the Coug with the fresh pearl
I had a plain nada, seven-trey Impala
Pop rocks, the fiends, they would holla
Stack a dollar, Captain Kingstone
Hella dollars, a nigga would bring home
My kingdome, the Country Club Crest
No vest? Catch a few to the chest
It might sound silly, but nigga really
Shake the cute bitch, had to do the dumb dilly
No cheese on the chili is all she wrote
Plus I heard she on yams, you know, she smoke
I ain’t no joke; when I spit, the mic smoke
Don’t roll it if it ain’t that light dope
Nigga, let the mic go; you ain’t no rapper
You ain’t no pimp, you scared to slap her
The cold cold capper, remember?
I put a bitch on a plane to Denver
She gon’ bring me back my money
Like the Gap Band say, she keep runnin’

I’m from the days of the Gumby and donkey ropes
Boss game to my brain, wrote chunky notes
Porch smoke in the household, pops a mack
Older cousin on the track, plus my uncle crack—fuck it
I want to bubble, started joogin’ the fam
Tuck it hot as the solution, flip the cuddie with cam, damn
See, the times done changed
Went from razor-cutting my ‘caine, clutching my thang, cut in the game
Burner gloves on my knuckles for the ballers at clubs
They hatin’ the dubs, ‘cause their bitch is offering hugs
Bitter smirk plus the purp got me learning the vibes
Throw on my Thizz eyes, ryde like Klyde, we ridin’ tonight

From the slow goals, with the matching hat and logo
Before I was two guns with a matching gat or 4-4
With another under my letterman, nothing better than
A have-not coming up, now he having knot, he coming up
I didn’t have homework, I had my own work
It’s money on my pages, yours even turn, don’t perk (Nope)
I’m fresh in my donkey rope
In my D-boy stance, grippin’ my donkey, hoe
Youngest nigga in the crackhouse
Half my clientele pops had in his cathouse
They know me well, they cracked out
They laugh about how simple I am, they want credit
I dead it, and no deals on grams
Keep your eye on me, youngin’, sharp, play my part
Look at me, I’m flossin’ now
Coogi down ‘cause mall fit ain’t in my style, wow

Click click pow, what’s up now?
Listen to my 9 millimeter go blaow
Get bit by mosquito, catch West Nile
If you ain’t in the pen, don’t be late for trial
It’s the new style, boy, and I vow
To make the dogs on my Cougnut bark and growl
I’ll pimp a heifer big as a cow
Without a movie star smile, don’t touch that dial
Lost a fed trial, slick as wet towel
Rough as a fuckin’ fingernail file
On top of the pile, they jockin’ my style
They wanna pimp like me but they don’t know how

But this is Thizzelle Washington, yeah
This is the Thizzelle Washington
The Nation of Thizzlam
I have wonderful McGill Lamont
I have young Klyde the Glide Julius Rydah
Be in the mammy fucktown pimpin’
And you know what I just realized about pimpin’?
Is it ain’t hoeing if you ain’t paying pimpin’
Y’all just out there fuckin’ and you might be stealin’
Fly a kite, take a flight
Bitch, rob two dykes
Go to the church and bust a priest out, bitch
But get my money
You take the offering
Sell your blood—kill the baby and sell the blood, man
Gorilla hoe—I want a gorilla hoe for this pimpin’
Is there any gorilla hoes in the building? (Where they at, mayne?)
I done had every hoe but a gorilla hoe
I want a bitch that’s gorilla hoeing
Throwing pussy blood on the track
Throw period blood at a trick, and stay in shape, bitch
Gorilla hoe for a nigga one time (Go hard, bitch)
What else?
What else could she do to prove herself to the Nation of Thizzm?",https://genius.com/Mac-dre-miss-you-lyrics

Telling me to stick it in

Infinite hitting it

Ask could I fix it up
Away away
To the junior college
All the bitches love the Escalade
To my knowledge
Sure enough, pulling up
Bumping a little beat
Pull a clydesdale slut from the middle east
She's looking too worthy (too worthy)
Off two ecstasy pills and it's daytime
Only 2:30
Hop in, hop in
She's singing 'ayo for yayo'
But she's saying I'm not quinn (what!)

Young Mac Dre
I pops it boy
I pops it big
It all started off with the doctor tellin' my momma push
On July 5th, one-nine-seven-oh, Mac Dre hopped out that puss
I've been soakin' game since Rock 'Em Sock 'Em and Hot Wheels
Not never the chance to pass me, I keep 'em jockin', I got skills
And when I'm on the mic, styles I got so many
Drink Privilege Hennessy when I ain't fuckin' with Rémy (Rémy?)
M-A-C D-R-E, that's me
Like 'em freaky like Janet, not Jackson, but jack me, yee!
To all my niggas in the manor, to Alabama
Rodrigo blowin' only homie, don't fuck with bammer
I plan to have a ticket and kick it in The Bahamas
Watch your hutch and don't trust your baby mama (Nah!)
'cause I will get your scrill when I kill, all in them guts
Don't give a fuck, when you give a crippled crab a crutch
But they respect it, if not they get rejected
I'm M-D, the MC, that's not to be corrected

Ichi, ni, san, shi. Uno, dos, cuatro (Cuatro?)
I'm sicker than ten J-cats that be gone off that vato (Ugh!)
Most sexual intellectual, with at least six figures before the decimal (Scrilla!)
Warm, hot, and respectable, but I'm nothin' correctable
I fucks with high rollers, shake highway patrollers
Quick to pop the trunk, but will come from the shoulders (That's right!)
Got the cuddie named Dubee, he spit more raps than loogies
And when he hand it to me, I'm funky like Mtume
“Do me. Baby, do me.” is all them hutches holler
I was breakin' bitches when phantom tops was on Granadas
More game than keno, gamblin' trips to Reno
Sippin' cappuccino, eatin' Italian cioppino
C-note stacka, pack a P89 (P89)
Love group sex, take 'em three at a time
And boy I be outta line, when I'm full o' that Tanqueray
Quick to grab the choppa, cock 'er, aim, and spray
Urban guerrilla, warfare extraordinaire
You know about my mackin', but boy I'm more than a playa (That right)
Resurrected, double R elected
Haters get ejected, I'm nothin' to be corrected

Pistol packin' playa, gangsta mac for reals (For reals)
About my scrill, got to pay my bills
Boy I'm in it to win it, if you weak and timid
Better watch how you spend it, I'll take yours like gimmicks
Bustin' out like titties (titties?), in a bra that's too small (Ha-ha)
Grew up off Too $hort, stackin' scrill too tall
Mac Drizzay, all damn dizzay
I keep hoes dizzay and the one-time bizzay
Been rappin' before they called Mac Mall Grimace
Romp in peace Mike Robinson, son of Dennis (That right)
I'm in this, too deep like Tim, Jim, and Johnny
Much love for my cuddies Jay, Ray, and Ronnie
Rapin' pockets I get mine, however it come
Boy I get dumb, about my income

Real before rappin
Respect before success

I've been down
For oh so long
Starin' at these prison walls
I want you to...
Step in my 1-5-0s for a minute
Step in my shoes
Walk in my shoes
Yeah
Just want you to see things like how I see em
You know
This is for all my niggas locked up
Check it out
Bottom bunk, sleepin' in a 2 man cell
C.O. at my do', and I'm mad as hell
Punk police cowboy from Texas
Talkin some shit 'bout servin' breakfast
It's 5:15, he must be psycho
Or just plain stupid for thinkin' I might go
I cussed him out, he gave me distance
But pressed his body alarm for quick assistance
Now these muthafuckas wanna do it the rough way
Five C.O.'s is what it takes to cuff Dre
Straight to the hole, but it ain't no thang
My celly got dank so I'm Kool And The Gang
See the L.T. for the disposition
28 days commissary restriction
Two days later back on the main line
Dopefiend's owe, so I go claim mine
25 cartons, now I'm straight
Keep 17, give the homeboys 8
Cop some hop, start back boomin'
Got em sendin' money on the Western Union
2 fat grams of that china white
Gon' have these dopefiends tryin to fight
Grabbed 3 cartons to goose some dank
And 5 whole packs for some hooch to drink
Now I'm chillin' in my cell lookin out the window
Drinkin' pruno, smokin' indo
Grabbed my shank, but when I'm finsta' bounce
They lock a nigga down for Census count
Look at jack books while I'm waitin'
Might even do a little masturbatin'
Trippin' off that bitch Dominique
I bust one quick while my celly sleep
Doors rack open, now it's time for movement
Goddamn pruno got a nigga too bent
Bounce to the movies with my homies
The title sound good but the shit was phony
Damn cigarettes won't let me breathe
Niggas gettin' restless, wantin' to leave
The lights flash on, quick as fuck
Somebody in the bathroom just got stuck
If he makes it, he'll be lucky
Six-inch blade stuck straight in gutry
25 cops rush the spot
Now I got one-time on my jock
Stash my shank underneath the seat
And make sure no blood is on my feet
Punk police wanna take me down
They put me on the wall and they shake me down
Now it's back to the block strapless
But I got two mo' in my mattress
One mo' time I peep the cops
Fuckin' with them boys from Grape Street, Watts
I said, ""Punk muthafucka, won't you leave 'em the hell alone""
Down to the third tier and got on the telephone
Called my bitch, but she showed me no love
Got on the phone, shot me a cold look
She said she can't talk, she got a sore throat
But she probably gettin' fucked by a sport coat
I'm goin' through it
Yeah
Y'all real niggas know

I've been down
Oh so long
Starin' at these prison walls
It's the same ol' song
Yeah, muthafucka
I done been there and back boy
I could tell you the story from rags to riches
How I did time with fags and snitches
That's real
It's really real
It's no drama

I got my fishing pole out trying to ceezatch
A big fish, I'm hungary, need a big bitch
I'ma bump a bitch with the quickness
Boy its just pimpin in my blood
Bitches, they all give him love
The Mac name Dre bitch, take it easy
You fuckin wit a street nigga thats greasy
I'll buck yo brotha, fuck yo motha
Keep it on the DL, its all undercover
I'm a hustler bitch, I pull capers
I only fuck with thugs that get paper
Chips, chedda, scrilla, real niggas, killaz, and drug dealers
Chorus 2x
24 hours, 7 days a week
I do my thug thang, playin in them streets
But the game I play really ain't no joke
Come around my way and you might get smoked
Bullet proof vest's, Chevy SS's
Come through in a bucket
The next day in a Lexus
It's a ghetto life
I don't have no wife
Boy I'm married to the game and I handle my
Business, I'm in this for the money not the honey
Square bitches spooked, they all run from me
Dummy, bitch, if you knew better, you do better
I'ma stay on bitch back like new sweaters
Mac Dre baby
Quit talkin crazy
When you get about some money
Its all gravy
Ask my last bitch square, that's all realla
I only fuck with pimps, killaz and drug dealers

On My Toes,What’s Really Going On?,UnKnown,"Kick back, relax, let me bust one (Bust one)
And don't trip if I cuss one (Cuss one)
Or two times while I'm spittin' the shit
It's just a way a nigga straight be gettin' the grit
Microphone master Mac Dre is the name
I got donkey for a bitch and when I'm slangin' the thang
Hoes go delirious 'cause the dick is so serious
Fuckin' bitch after bitch, 'cause they all be curious
A young nigga down to break you for everything
And 'Mr. Flamboyant' is a song I'll never sing
I'm not with The Click shit, I'm straight with the sick shit
And any South sucka, I'm ready to get wit'
Romped out Crest down muthafucka
This Romp life I could never get enough of
Ridin', sidin', whippin', dippin'
24-7, a nigga ain't trippin'
Hoes steady tryna do me
Stay the fuck back, you damn tramp hoochie
M.D., the playa of the 9-0
You got 10 bitches, I got 10 fine hoes
That's how it goes, I'm a pimp and it shows
Stay on my toes, stay on my toes, stay on my toes
Stay on my toes

I'm a lyrical rap-speakin-makin-beatin combination
Straight from the Crest, unlike the rest, I'm here to rock the nation
I'm down with E and A.G. Curt, Marty and Jason
I smoke the weed, it gets me keyed, but never would I be lacin'
Nothin' clean, on the heem, you rarely see me sober
I break a bitch who's filthy rich, I'm always gettin' over
Give me ya number on the under, love to get to know ya
I'd get ya hot and hit the spot, just gimme the chance to show ya
The M the A the C the D the R the E
Suckers imitate, but it's hard to be
A young playa shootin' to the tizzop
Could never be a sucker who's sprung on some cizzot
Mac Drizzay, the one you like to listen to
I'm on the dizzank and now I'm fixin' to
Get dizzope with some shit I wrizzote
I got a Chizzev and every time I yizzoke
You see smizzoke and then you start to chizzoke
Pockets stay fizzat, could never be brizzoke
Mac Drizzay, all damn dizzay, I get bizzay and stack that pizzay
The one you like to hear recite the raps I write
I never bite, I'm not the type, don't take me light, we'll have to fight
Sick with the shit, so muthafucka, you better get it right
A money makin', hoochie sinkin', Crestside player
6-foot-1 with lots of curls in my hair
So much game I need to run for mayor
She steady pays me, but I never will pay her
Day, Ray and clique, they got my bizzack
Ronnie, D and Freak, some more in the pizzack
My manager Stan drives a Cadillizzac
And Khayree pays me real fizzat

Fizzat, fizzat, fizzat, fizzat, fizzat, fizzat
I'm just a mizzack, mizzack
Makin' lotsa money on the Sage Street trizzack
Trizzack, trizzack, trizzack, trizzack
Stay on my toes
I'm just a mi-, mi-, mi-, mi-, mi-, mi-, mizzack, mizzack, mizzack

Shady character like Don King, so you better keep your eye on me
I done bust niggas in the grill and had 'em wearin' partials
Jacked high rollers and ran from the US Marshals
It's called survival, and only the strong can survive
And went the distance with the feds while some of my partners took a dive
Strive to stay alive, can't let no nigga smother me
Got to stay F-R-double-E and keep these bitches lovin' me
Sippin' bubbly, breakin' down buds from a fat sack
Reservations at Crustaceans or Art's Crab Shack
I stacks fat 'cause a macaroni gots to have cheese
Puttin' pillows in cigarillos and Backwood leaves
And I drinks Heem by the gallon, so sometimes I might trip
Infrared beam with black talons and that extended clip
Quick to do some sprayin', so nigga, watch what you sayin'
You'll get your show cancelled like Keenen Ivory Wayans

I'm just a pimp, mayne, tryin' to stack some Funyuns
So I can have French maids pedicure my bunions

Yo hutch must be feedin' you fish head stew

Mac Dre shake broke hoes with boatloads of kids
Tell a bitch she can take a long walk off a short bridge
And hope she land in shark-infested waters
Heartless, takin' over turfs like Nino did the Carters
Kidnapped by the Feds and treated like a sucker
But now I'm free they see payback's a motherfucker
I'm stickin' my dick in all they daughters and nieces
Now CO's and PO's want me restin' in pieces
Hittin' pieces so hard that it'll make your nose bleed
And I been smokin' since niggas was on gold weed
Born to be a player, rhyme-sayer and clock grits
Strapped with two 23 spittin' chop sticks
Quick to kick a bitch to the curb
And get back with her on a 33rd
I never worry, never worry, it's all copacetic
Got mo' game than needed insulin in a diabetic

I'm just a pimp, mayne, tryin' to stack some Funyuns
So I can have French maids pedicure my bunions

Yo hutch must be feedin' you fish head stew

I be fitted, dipped in butter, hair cut like Kobe
Blindin' hoes with science like Thomas Dolby
Pullin' on black and milds, sippin' top-shelf Cuervo
Playin' with my hutch hair while she lickin' on my navel
Stable full of money-makin' stallions
Been in the feds with dreads from Jamaica and Italians
Shrimp scampi eater, Peter long as the Love Boat
Puffin purple kush at the building with my cuzzo
Strapped, armed, ready, ain't nobody goosin' me
Got Roll-Os hid in my load where the airbags used to be
Boy, you should see how I act off the privilege
Hennessy, it's like Popeye's spinach
I'm ready to take heads off, gunplay or fight
I dot eyes and have 'em wearin' they sunglasses at night
Fool, that's real, that ain't no frontin'
Them punk-ass niggas don't wanna see Dre about nothin'

Me Damac,Ronald Dregan: Dreganomics,2004.0,"Here's a little something about me damac
I like the low cut jeans where you can see the crack
Get drunk off the priv, the heem, the yak
Then drink a double shot, to bring me back
I'm from where you never see a seed in a sack
The Bay boy and Dre boy is bringing it back
I'm ""handlin suffa"", what's the meaning of that?
You'll never see a nigga that's as clean as the Mac

Call me Mr. Kleenex, I'm so cold
Icy wrists like I've been making snow cones
What's up homes? What size them rims is?
Twenty-two mother fucking inches
Seats big as benches, I never touch wrenches
The only work I do, is working these bitches
My palm itches, that means money
Have you ever seen bling, bling when it ain't sunny?
This ain't funny, they can't slow me down
Big bad wolf can't blow me down
Every bad bitch, want to blow me now
Oh you know me now? oh you my homie now?
I get dumb, stewy in your face
Hop out the Benz with the Louis briefcase
Cheapskate? Fuck the price
You ain't really cool if you ain't got ice


Dre get whip shipped fresh off the dock
A mafia type, drink scotch on the rocks
The weed man love me, I cop quarter pops
Do a donut on the cops, fuck the shocks, make the car hop
Shake me locks on the hoes jock
I make them robots, they bring me swoll' knots
I bring them show knocks, boy Dre spit heaters
Four door mob shots, don't fuck with two seaters
I fuck with two heaters, identical twins
When I ain't feelin' the Henn man I'm killin' the gin
Rhyme stealin' again, dime stealin' again
Stab the blood out a nigga like I'm still in the pen
Uhh, Elvis ex-b
Fuck her if she sexy, fuck with Num and Yuk
Fuck with Quinn and Messy
C-R-E-S-T, the Bay I'm mappin' this
Niggas start slappin' this, ASAP-alis


Man there go the police, I'm not trippin'
I'm too legit to quit and I'm squeaky clean pimpin'
If they see me when I'm dippin' I got ""El Debarges""
And a square bitch with me, to the take the charges
I'm fly as I partridge, keep a extra cartridge
Down like linoleum, rugs and carpets
When I park it, uhh, the Benz rims still spin
On Market and O'Ferrell, I still pimp
You still rent? I got 4 paid for
It's Mac Dre-goes, taking your pesos
Cause I like gravy on my potatoes
Rap and break hoes, is how my day goes
On fire like Dego, I'm out of control
And like KC cheese, I'm on a roll
I'm on a roll like the Greyhound bus
The hoes hound us and always surround us
The Adam's Mark suite, is where they found us
It's home run hits, no flies or groundas",https://genius.com/Mac-dre-me-damac-lyrics
Cuddies Say “Yee”,The Best of Mac Dre Volume Three,2005.0,"I’m a Crestland, mad man, Country Club psycho
With assault rifle and hatred for the 5-O
Early death is normal, so we smoke Perry Como
Make the minutes move slo-mo
Wil’ out for now, ‘cause when it end, we really don’t know
Youngsters have King Kong on they back before they grow old
And in my turf, the streets so cold
Put this on this choppa that I hold
Fuck with my kinfolks and we’ll be tagging your toe

Man, this a rough life, I tuck gun, tuck knife
I bust back, bust once, bust twice
This 40 thang, will tear off your bumper
It’s my only gang, I call my thumper
Nigga, I’ll jump ya, all by myself
With no help, if you die, oh well
No love felt, people, I’m a menace
It’s Macassi on the mic, we playin’ tennis

C-U-T-T-H-O-A-T
Squares disappear when cuddies holla “Yee!”
Breezies don’t scream, paramedics clean the scene
Slay the lames with SK’s and AR-15’s
C-U-T-T-H-O-A-T
Squares disappear when cuddies holla “Yee!”
Breezies don’t scream, paramedics clean the scene
Slay the lames with SK’s and AR-1-Feens

I’m in the club VIP, with me thing
Feelin’ the DJ rhythm wide swing
I’m searching, looking for a guinea pig
Splat any wig, strapped with the mini Sig
On Remy big, high-tech cyber
Dre MacGyver, getaway driver
Always tighter than the po-po or the feds
I’m ridin’ somethin’ hi-po with ported heads
Your boy with dreads and take the guys on one
Frozen goods? Boy, I’m gon’ run
Dumb outlaw, on a crooked path
Tryna look at cash, look at wood on the dash
Look at screens, listen to the satellites
Big appetite, nigga ain’t actin’ right
I’m ill, so real you smell it
MacEnroe, tell ‘em how to spell it

Squares disappear when cuddies holla “Yee!”
Breezies don’t scream, paramedics clean the scene
Slay the lames with SK’s and AR-1-Feens

Now, nigga, bounce, break out
Run a route, scatter when you see my scowl
Followed by the fully K imported from Moscow
Since a creeper crawled, we did fugazis foul
Hardest nigga test the line, he gots to blast me now
Three C beast, North Pole of V-Town
And all my niggas make these bitches run like greyhounds
We have no funk, guerilla warfare style
Move on you without a sound and all of a sudden, crack your crown
Doctors say smoke and poison make you senile
Especially in them Backwoods, but fuck it, blaze the pound
And did I mention, we do the Rodney King, Reginald Denny

First, I do like this
Put a look on my face like I smelled some piss
Bounce to the beat till it start to hurt
Then I dust all the smirk off me shirt
Dip to the ground as I catch the bass
Then I wipe all the sweat off me face
Hop back up then I start to slide
Poppin my collar as I glide
Then I break the thang down and do the bird
Dust myself off like I just stole third
Come on everybody now's the chance
Fuck the harlem shake this the Thizzelle Dance

Bounce with the car as it start to shit
Then you open up the car doors
The whole damn car low
Hopped out the Impalo
While you let the car roll
Ghostride the whip while you ride the strip
Here's your chance to do your dance on the side of it
While you at it the passenger and driver switch
Then hurry up and jump back inside your shit
Hanging out the rooftop

The adventures of Al Boo Boo,Judge Dre Mathis,2005.0,"Not long ago in a place real far
I knocked this hutch at a grill slash bar
Fucking up some prawns n chips
Cause Mac Dre don't eat omelets
Suckin' my teeth like I'm the shit
On gin but I think it's time to switch
Bar tender give me something strong
Don't want no Iced Tea Island Long
Gimmie stoli's with Roses lime
Man I get that all the time
Throwback, Steve Largent #80
I looked up and I saw this lady
On my momma, I ain't fat mouthin'
The bitch looked like she could suck a thousand
But her ass wasn't really all that giant
She must have been workin' her Fonda diet
Man you know she looked alike
That Filipino broad jay used to like
Bottom line, she was fine
You don't see this kind all the time
Man you know my name first is Mac
Walked up to her put down my act
I said 'Excuse me, lady, is somethin' wrong?
You've been staring at pimpin' way too long
Why do you keep on eyeing a nigga?'
Cuddie, the bitch started cryin a river?!
I said 'What's wrong?' like a cared...
She said she caught her pimp fucking a square
I said damn you must be devastated
She said I've been with him since I graduated...
But wait a minute... you look familiar
I said 'C'mon now, look, Cecilia
That's the oldest line in the book
That's bunk like dope I used to cook'
She said 'Uhh don't you rap?'
I said 'Yes, it is I, Andre the Mac'
She said 'Well, uh, if that's the case then wave five thou wow in my face'
She said she's been my fan since she was 12
And if she was gonna choose it might as well be me
The M to the D and that five thou wow choosing fee?
(Now this story has four possible endings
Is Mac dre a going to A) reach back like a pimp and slap the ho and tell her 'bitch beat it
I ain't no rest haven for runaway bitches'
B) Start speaking Swahili 'cause he thinks the bitch is the fuzz tryin' ta pinch pimpin
C) Or does he P.I.M.P and tell the bitch 'Put it in my pocket, you beezy'
I said 'Look, if you want Dreezy
You gonna have to put it in my pocket, you beezy'
The bitch reached in her Fendi bag and almost made pimpin' grow a shag
I said 'God damn, bitch' The bitch had 40 grand, kids
10 thousand in stacks of ten I said 'They gonna put you up under the pen'
I said 'We can't do this in no bar
Let's talk about things in my car'
Who is this bitch can I trust her?
Took her outside to my Plymouth duster
She said there's one more thing that you should know
There's one more hoe and where I go she go
I said where I come from 3 is fun, plus, 1 is too close to none

Mac Dre, I'm one nice dream
And I'll make your brain melt like ice cream

I'm Livin' It, distribute it
The streets are inhibited
By cut throat niggas just like me that's out there getting dividends

I always feel like somebody's watching me
But ain't no droppin' me or poppin' me or stoppin' me
Got animosity
For the way these notches be
Constantly, jockin' me
But fail to pay me properly
I'm stuck up in the clouds high velocity
Gone off that broccoli, and every ho that I could see
I'm steady poppin' P, Its like rockin' D
I put the whammy on it, nigga, now I'm clockin' G's
More than Monopoly, boy this a knockin' beat
More game than Socrates, the champ boy when I compete
That constant be, poppin' E, when I drop a heat
It's a knock when I drop, boy, and rock the beat

I'm Livin' It, distribute it
The streets are inhibited
By cut throat niggas just like me that's out there getting dividends

The turntables might wobble but they won't fall down
It's on, back hooked with Mac Mall now
We stack tall now, dope as raw pile
Pow, listen to that faggot scream OW
We gon' leave him leaking in the middle of the aisle
Now they're wondering how to explain it to his child
Drunk with a smile, while staggering
Poppin' at a beezy, so I can have her in
The strip club, it's uh... nathin'
Black, Caucasian, and even Asian
I'm leaving taste in her mouth, blowing ace in her house
To the face in her house, is you safe in her house?

I'm Livin' It, distribute it
The streets are inhibited
By cut throat niggas just like me that's out there getting dividends",https://genius.com/Mac-dre-livin-it-lyrics
Chevs & Fords,It’s Not What You Say...It’s How You Say It,2001.0,"Cause I'm the Chevy man
The Chevy man?
Yes, I'm the Chevy man

I'm a Ford man
Mob in my old school because I can
I'm a Ford man
Turnin figure eights with a blunt in my hand

My partner got a ElCo, my homie got a '
Maro
He Mexicano, might rock a sombrero
My cuzzo got a 
Mali' sittin on Rally's
He candy green, might've seen him in the Valley
My uncle got a imp', he a pimp
96 in the flow when he hide behind a tint
My auntie got a 'Vette so tight she might wreck
My cuddy got a candy 
Nova
, he hella wet
My granny got a 'Burban, not an Excursion
Gramps got a 
Silverado, Stepside version
My nigga Nate got a 
Z-28
And if the rollers get behind him, boy, he finna shake
My folks got a 
glasshouse
 and when he mash out
I crack the heem and pull the grass and the hash out
Catch Dre in a trey, revvin it
Please believe it, I'm always Chev'in it


I hit the California coast in a 
California Mustang
Shelby drop-top so hot on them gold thangs
I get the thumbs up, I like that old school Ford
I got the 64 Falcon, all original, restored
Sports coupe Sprint, not a ding or a dent
390 V8, you didn't know they made them
Or my XR-7 '71 convertible
429 Cobra Jet unservable
I'm a Ford man, never bored, man, I got collection
Smash on a Chevy, then I smoke the intersection
Give us a parking lot and let the sideshow commence
Young niggas lose on the impounds and dents
High speeds, I knows all about em
Old school Vettes and Lil Bruce straight clownin
I slap my shit on low and let the rollers feel my pan
They know they can't see me cause I be the Ford man



This is high speed chase play, I'm first on race day
I'm at the stoplight with my cutthroat Mac Dre

I'm at the light on slicks pushin on the throttle
SS 400 small block Monte Carlo

69 Falcon lights squarer than my first ho
427 with the four in the floor

Yeah, you lookin hella clean and kinda mobby
But my gears snatch quick with this 12 bolt posi

Yeah, I like the candy but I'ma blow ya doors
I got the 750 double pump Holly on flows

Cam, lifters, B&M shifter
Nitrous oxide make the Chevrolet swifter

Trick Flow and Hurst with nitrous burst
Make the sports coupe fly and the Chevy boys cry

I got ported aluminum heads, I'm hella fast

Hmm I wonder why?
Hey man what's this all on it? Slob?
Nigga, quit giving the blunt a blowjob
Always cutting, trying to show stop
Oh you get an extra hit just because we at your spot?
I need some more pot cause this ain't kosher
Call Rich the Factor cause I need dozier

Microphone check, let me kick to the beat
Dedicated to you bitches, let me spit to you freaks
I'm gonna serve it to you straight a little something like this
Not one of those niggas that be liking to kiss
There's no telling what your tongue licks, it might be big dicks
So you better try kissing on them other tricks
'Cause Lottie Lohawk, I like to bohawk
I know you love when I shove a thrust up in your cot
All damn day


I'm MD and mackin' is my duty
So when I step to you girl and tap you on your big booty
And start spittin' some pimpin' ass serious shit
Don't even start trippin' on how freaky you get
It's just a gift to G-A-B, to get to your P-A-D
Bash in your ass, inside of the B-E-D
Went to 415 and not the 012
Now you fiending for more, but you wait 'til I call you
See some of these niggas cold want you to jock 'em
Stupid muthafuckas, but I can't knock 'em
I just wanna bash, hoe, and only get cash, hoe
You want Dre to stay and lay, but I have to pass, hoe
'Cause I'm mackin' all damn day


'Cause that lovey dovey shit just ain't gon' get it
When I pick you up to fuck, I straight hit it and quit it
And you dont trip because the sexin' is good
I be wreckin' 'em good and they be back in the hood
Tellin' my cuddies how cool it was
Now another Romp player might give you a buzz
Young C-U-R-T, or maybe young Marty
Or my homeboy J might be your type of party
Whoever it is, they gon' get with you, bitch
And dont even think they gon' sit with you, bitch
No talkin' and walkin' 'cause that shit is funny style
You pay me and lay me and when I take your money I'll...
Spend that shit all damn day


I'm hard but saucy, bitch back on off me
Steady tryna toss me, hoe, smell the coffee
I gave you some, hoe, did not cum though
Your too damn dumb, hoe; what you actin' sprung fo'?
I'm hard to get with, pimperistic
I want your lipstick on top of my dick tip
I'm from the V-A double L E-J
O and you know, hoe, the things that we say
Are simple and plain, nothin' but game
And if you ain't up on it, Mac Dre is the name
I want a fat ass joint of that potent zesty
And a thick chocolate bitch whose name is Nestle
From the C-R-E-S-T, 'cause that's where the best be
Suckas get jealous and they try to test me
So I carry a nine all the time
Dope raps I rhyme, this is how I grind
Making stacks of cash, down to wax that ass
A nigga ready to blast a muthafucka real fast
Dickin' the hoes, never lickin' the hoes
Big black dick is what I stick in the hoes
I shake 'em, I break 'em, but never would I take 'em
To eat hamburgers let alone some steak and
Lobster, 'cause baby I'm a mobster

Baby over there let me see that booty jiggle

Whatever you're doing cutty, put it on pause
I just made some phone calls to some thong broads
Long jaws, skullery queens
That's boss if you don't know what skullery means
If you really want to get some cock, meet me at the Mission Rock
I'll be in the back with two bitches doing the twist and pop
Twist and pop, booty drop the oopty-ah
I'll be thizz dancin, shakin my dookie locks
Watchin' coochie-cock, pop, shake and wiggle
Mommy havin fun, she giggle like it tickle
Dump truck booty, rump plump cutie
Giggin' so hard, making faces like she pooting

I'm lampin', perkin' off the Remy
Dancing with baby in the dental floss bikini
Wow, she's letting it all out
Her man find out, bet ya they fall out
They hate it, I make 'em dance X-rated
Get 'em faded, thizzle, Drizzle, related
Hello, would you look at that jello
She don't need no music, she can do it acapello
DJ cut it and mellow, I got one in stilettos
I want to show her my new dance:  ""The Abbot and Costello""
I'm on another level, boy I'm passed drunk
Furley getting with girlies that backin that ass up

I want a chick that breaks off the chips
Something thick from Rick's House of Tricks
One that can get low, work that strip pole
A Mitchell Brother broad from San Francisco
A stripper from Portland, a cute soft one
One that work at The Dolphin on McLaughlin
A lady or two from The Crazy Horse II
A yo-tal that works at Coco's
I want a lady from the Mexican channel
That got more back than a motha fuckin camel
A pretty ho, from a rap video
One that can make her ass and titty go

Gift 2 Gab,Young Black Brotha (LP),1993,"Knick knack patty wack, give your ho some donkey
Listen to the bassline, don't it sound funky?
Who could it be in the place to stay?
That's right, ho, Mac muthafuckin’ Dre
One more time back in your ear
Those dope ass raps you love to hear
Cold as ice, nothin’ nice
If I thrust ya once, ho, I’ma thrust ya twice
That's right, and you know the deal
You don't want the baby, ho, take the pill
‘Cause I'ma bust fadles back to back
And when I get tired, I'ma take a nap
And when I wake up, I'ma bath some more
It's the same routine until It's time to go
You, get what’s in my drawers, and girl I get those sugar walls
Oh, you didn't know about me?
The A the N the D the R the E
Well, peep game, it goes like this
I hold my mic tight like my dick when I piss
And when it comes to cock, girl, I won't clean it
Always got my damn hat to the muthafuckin’ jimmy
Cold, bold, 19 years old
With a brain full of game to be told
I'm from the V-town, 3 C down
And a sucka don't wanna see me clown
Who (who) could it be?
That’s right, Mac Dre, baby
Funky fresh, in the flesh
It's me, Khayree and my joint of sess
Doin’ it, like a porno star
Hittin’ in your box, or in your car
Cool, like the sweat from a snowman
Kick back, relax and listen, here we go, man
To the land of the dope rhyme
And as the song flows on, I really hope I’m
Not too dirty or rap too strong
But my mouthpiece is really goin’ on
From Vallejo, California all the way to China
Hoes of the world, know I’ma
Stone cold mack with a gift to spit
Nothin’ but that dope shit
So damn fly, don't ask me why
I smoke Indo and I smoke Thai
Mac Dre, I thought you knew
Down and dirty doin’ things that only playas can do
The coldest MC on this here Earth
Had to be fresh from the Crestside turf (Crestside)
Not a Southside sucka who thinks he can rhyme
But a Crestside playa that's strapped with a 9
And it don't stop

I say microphone check 1, 2, 1, 2
It's young Mac Dre, right back at you
Wit’ another dose of that dope
You see, I’m way more potent than coke
The young fly brotha’s on the mic, y’all
I’m finna rock this muthafucka all night, y’all
And just spittin’ and dope shittin’
And to a nice, smooth beat that’s hittin’
Cold as ice, clean as soap
I keep a fresh bag of zags in my Derby coat
24 hours around the clock
7 days a week, I’m on a prowl for cock
Day in, day out, I spit and shout
A true blue mack, know what I’m talkin’ about?
It’s just game (game), straight game (game)
Kick back, let it soak in your brain (mane)
Listen to me spit that pimpin’ tip
I put the money to the wallet and the pussy to the dick
Stack a bank, slap a pack
Put my muthafuckin’ tape in ya goddamn deck
Man, take a bitch, break a bitch
And when you're all done, cuddy, man, shake the bitch
Straight high-sidin’ when you come through squat
Leave a muthafuckin’ cloud in the parking lot
Load the brains, do some thangs
Put the mounts on your fingers, man, fuck the chains
Play that ho like a game of checkers
Treat her like dirt, take her money and wreck her
‘Cause a ho, ain’t no good (no good)
Whip her punk ass? Man, I sho’ would
It’s ’90, you gotta be def
Take all the money until there ain’t none left
You see, some young brothas give her tongue
Lick between her legs and try to get her sprung
That ain’t the tip, ah, nah
You stupid muthafuckas, what’s wrong wit’ y’all?
It don’t take all that to get that ho
If you can’t her, nigga, say, ‘Trick that ho’
‘Cause when you come up, she’ll be jockin’
On your front door, man, she’ll be knockin’
When you let her in, it’s straight to the covers
That’s the way it goes, believe me, brotha
I’ve been through it all, it don’t mean nothin’
Pussy ain’t shit, make the ho pay somethin’
It’s Mac Dre, hear what I say
I spit the gift to gab, nigga, every day
Pimpin’, straight pimpin’
I don’t wanna see you simpin’
Listen to my tape, play it all the time
And when it’s over, man, press rewind
‘Cause it’s dope shit, you gotta hear it
And like coke, nigga, you gon’ clear it
And to the top I’m goin’
Bitch, I’m flowin’
And it…and it…and it don’t stop

Crest Shit,The Genie of The Lamp,2004.0,"Once upon a time, before I had a seed
I was on the block with rocks and hella bags of weed
I’ve calmed down, used to live savagely
Hurt feelings, killings, a lot of tragedy
Once upon a time, I had everybody mad at me
Haters wanted to see them winning, rather me
Gradually, I started having cabbage, see
And only my real folks was glad to see me
MD, doggin’ and doin’ it
Staying true to the game, and never ruin it
You need nothin’ else but me on the menu
It’s Crest shit, Dubee, continue

We went from cookin’ and joogin’ that crack sack
Strappin’ a backpack to blappers that rat-tat
Let your boy state the pure facts
Ever since a nitwit, me and my niggas been wit’ this
Runnin' wit' , marksmen don’t miss
And this shit, got me to the point I can’t help but do my thang
Slang mills, chops with the Furl, spinnin’ circles ‘round you lames
These cutthoat niggas came to snatch a stack of racks in flame
Snatchin’ everything in the way, a punk rock gon’ save
My work knock always, scrilla grit getta, sick nigga
Blappin’ a chop four-clip spitta, go get your clique, nigga
I’m hollerin’ ‘yo ho ho’ with this pimp-a-lish heem
J. Diggs, tell these cats what I mean (What you mean?)

If you knows not who I’m kin to
Then you knows not what I been through
You knows about the Romp? Then you knows what I be into

Chances is you ain’t knowin’ about Diggs, Dolla and Dubee
Double up like a doolie, I show you who my crew be
Run off in your neighborhood, Crestsiders make a movie
Put my gat where your ass at, face where my mask be
Gangsta ass nigga puttin’ nothin’ fuckin’ past me
Got a question? Better not ask me
Tuck you in my backseat
Leave you all muffled like a nigga ridin’ wit’ bad beat
It’s Diggs, dude, north side of the V
And brought the Unda Dogg, another nigga ridin’ wit’ me

Shit gettin’ sticky, it’s very tricky how these streets’ll lock us up in this game
For riches and fame, so bitches jock us, slangin’ that ‘caine
Bodies get slain, hoping the cops don’t pop us, breaking through chains
All in the hood, ducking helicopters, hard to maintain
We gettin’ chains, I keep them hater-stoppers, nickels and bows
For my foes, no love for baller blockers gettin’ a grip
If we slip, then that’s the end of it
Crossed by a snitch, so now the Feds got wind of it
Taking for granted nothin’ on this planet, I’m tryin’ to get paid
Lawyer fees to manage just in case the police raid

Trying to steal a rich Lucy from a Ricky Ricardo
Fuck a wife I want a ho that look like Nelly Furtado
To take me skiing in Aspen, Colorado
Cash in like the Lotto then pass me the bottle
Cause they know live life lav is my motto

Fresh clothes from the dry clean, and my bling shine like high beam
I'm a eighteen wheeler, nigga I'm realer
So I can steal her, peal her, and drill her
I'm the dope rhyme dealer
Bust like a nine milla got hoes in Chowchilla
Cutt throatettes, cause my hoes are realer
My hoes are stealer's, boosters, and pick pockets
Get profits and praise the pimp prophet
Trick stop it before I take it there
Quit while your ahead you'll never make it player

You need your mic hand amputated
I can't be faded this games been bladed, it's lame saturated
I don't know how these cats done made
They must be all related they making things complicated
You need your mic hand amputated

I can't be faded you Macs done ran out of words
I spit predicates, pronouns, and adverbs
Everybody talking about copping birds
You ever cop four pounds of white widow from a nerd
Your game is to the curb might got to conserve
No flavor you lack herbs
Your not seasoned like honky food
Your not funky dude, your beats ain't bumping dude
Its fools like you the give the game a bad name
You beach cruiser loser, stay in the bike lane
Or get ran over, found bent over
You can't be a rapper, you be to damn sober
Your yogurt passed the expiration date
Got no work no cash and you perpetrate

Ugh.. that's real..
For real that's you?
He said that's real!

Since I was a young buck
My mackin was cool
I use to tounge kiss girls
In the back of the school
And maybe sometime a nigga
Got more than a kiss
I put my finger in some puss
That smelt like piss
And as I reminisce its kinda funny
How I talked lil girls out they lunch money
They didn't run from me
They used to jock young Dre
Then I stepped up game
And got some cock one day
It was a bloody mess
And yes tight as some vice grip
But I was a lil nigga killin some tight shit
Tossed her and started fuckin her few friends
Cause she told two friends and they told two friends
And word got out that young Dre could fuck good
Then I fucked a bitch who could fuck and suck good
And after that 
cock
 was nothin to me
So I flipped the script and stopped fuckin' for free
Every bitch I dicked down
Had to kick down
Whoever I tossed up
Had to cough up
Young in the game man
But quick to learn
That money makes this world turn
So I peeped game
Popped that thang
And let fools know
How I got that name
Mac Dre, boy..

I use to creep on Crest Streets
With a tight mask on
Posted, Toasted getten my cash on
Strapped with a gat and a bottle of hendo
Orange zig-zags and big bags of that 
endo
I pushed pebbles through the mid night hour
24-7 same clothes no shower
Dope sacks smellin' like nut sacks
But fuck it
I was checkin duckets
Collectin buckets, but now
I'm fresh out the pen
With a chip on my soulder
And now that I'm older
My blood runs much colder
Somebody told a Fed I was in the mix
Hittin' licks
..
Nigga ain't that a bitch?!
I make raps, stay far from saps
Check my traps and collect my snaps
Country Club Crest
 is where I got this game
And rappin' on the mic is how I got that name..

You heard?
I done heard yo' tape, Mac; that shit is wack
Why the fuck you sellin' that?
You need to go back to sellin' crack
Take it from a nigga that done been to hell and back
Oh yeah, I forgot, you ain't sold a god damn crumb
You's a studio gangsta, chump
Where the fuck you from?
No love for the niggas that done laced your muthafuckin boots
Niggas that slaved, went to the grave for you
Niggas that ain't scared to shoot
You Gilligan ass nigga, I remember I was makin' your promos
Now you want to diss your real folks and chop it up with them homos
Like that nigga Khayree, you let that sissy cross game?
Salt me up usin' your name?
I guess it's just a ho thang
Y'all niggas killin' me, with all that gay shit
All y'all niggas came up, fuck that Mac Dre shit
Mark Mall, you need to be fucked up the bootyhole
Knowin' the first time you touched the mic was in my studio
You niggas must have forgot before I was bustin' raps and rhymes
I was on the track with a sack sippin' 'yack strapped with a gat and a nine
I've been to your house, I've seen your chrome
But you ain't gone bust a grape in Napa Valley with golf shoes on
A bitchmade nigga gets no love from a real G
Cuddies from the 3 C's,  I know you feel me
I should have known when I came home somethin' was wrong
Your own crew tried to have your dome
And just left that shit alone
Now you wanna fuck with a cutthroat nigga that been doin dirt
Since creased 5-0-1's, Chuck Taylors and them Izod shirts
Them 5-trey-5 niggas don't like you
Don't believe it, hop in your Jaguar, nigga, and slide through
You'll be lucky to leave the ghetto with just a leakin' lip
You feelin' froggish I'm feelin' hoggish, boy, we can slip
In granny backyard, then when you act hard
I'm a treat you like a Mac Bitch, Young Mac Mark
Young Black Brothas Records is a goddamn flop
Khayree needed to stop way back when his ass got dropped
From that major label, nigga had a major stable
But he shot himself in the head, boy, and the blow was fatal
God don't like ugly, boy, ask yo mama
Now everywhere you trav' you better have Usalama
Mac Mall gets no love, ask my nigga Dubee
He shook us for videos and pretty hoes and left us out his movie
That nigga left me for dead when I was doin' time in jail
Couldn't shoot a nigga nathan when he was havin' major mail
You's a back stabba or should I say a Mac stabba
Well, here's some Mac magic, nigga...abra cadabra
I just turned your ass into an official bitch
Fuck you and your cousin Gilla, dirty snitch

Smurf cut it up
Smurf cut it up
Smurf cut it up

She's broke as a joke, I don't want yo bitch
I want some rope and a gumbo mix
I Mutombo hits, slap a bitch out the air
It ain't fair I'm a California bear
Grizzly Adams, in a Benz on Davins
Thizzin', savin', gone off that log cabin
Hocus, pocus, DJ Macadoscious
Watch me turn these blunts into roaches
I come with doses, while Smurf cut it up
Let's nut it up and make punks shut it up
I rub it up, smack it up and dick down it down
Bustin' styles like clips and rounds
How you like me now? Fool, what it do?
It's Don't Hate the Player Part 2
How you like me now? Fool, what it do?
It's Don't Hate the Player Part 2

If you hate the player, you hate the game

Man, you been actin' kinda strange lately
Because your bitch licked and ate me?
If you hate me, you hate the game
It's a fuckin' shame like what's his name
It's nothin', mayne, you didn't need her
She's raw, she jawed me in her two-seater
A two-liter in her mouth I busted
Shake the broad, dog, she can't be trusted
She put mustard on my hot dog
And paid a pimp before she shook the spot, dog
I'm top dog, don't hate it
Every rims I skated was chrome plated
I made it, I'm successful
And you hate it 'cause your life is so stressful
Things get a little easier
You gotta get cheesier and more peasier",https://genius.com/Mac-dre-dont-hate-the-player-2-lyrics

 hit a nigga for glasses
Sucker comes, ass kicked, still slide in plastic
Closed caskets, niggas be blasting
When a nigga write a check then his ass can't cash it
Told you handle the ball but you want to pass it
In the  nigga, now going the other way
Man I was just visiting but now we back in the Bay
Straight black and granite I hit the ho like 
 just considered it TD'ed
Signed out of high school, skipped college for all pro
Fuck a scholarships I'm signing contracts for major dough
What you in it for? nigga that million dollar brain
With a hundred thousand karats on my bling
And I'm the whole team,  22 inch stance
I'm like  calling a sack out of sprint

I feed my bitch, with nathan but game (nathan but game)
Her last nigga tried to spit it, but it ain't the same (it's not the same)
I feed my bitch, with nathan but game (nathan but game)
Her last nigga tried to spit it, but it ain't the same (it's not the same)

Her last nigga tried to spit it, but it ain't the same (it's not the same)

I know ho's that get straight to the point
The bitch will hit the dick before she hit the joint
Lick it up, nut sucking on balls and toes
Taking numbers on these little low nasty ho's
Back it up, let me see your box of pearls
Keep dick in your mouth and you bet not hurl
Girl tell me, have you served a pimp before?
Do your boyfriend know that you a prostitute?
Working on a trick, flushing out chips in clubs
Get your punk ass back on track, suck and fuck
Bitch what? I could give a fuck about ya
B-A dot kamikaze clowned ya
Found ya, found ya, ho I'm proud ta
Be a pimp that will beat a bitch and bounce up
Now up in niggas like some wrapping dimes
While you selling cot I be popping cons

I feed my bitch, with nathan but game (nathan but game)
Her last nigga tried to spit it, but it ain't the same (it's not the same)
I feed my bitch, with nathan but game (nathan but game)

I feed my bitch, with nathan but game (nathan but game)
Her last nigga tried to spit it, but it ain't the same (it's not the same)

A nigga almost snapped, trapped behind bars
But now on the streets I pull freaks around bars
Fast cars, hash cigars, no more sneaking balloons past the guards
I flip whips like a baller flips kicks
I'm the almighty mack, Andre Hicks
Ritz, cracker, smoke  in hot sauce
 smoke and kill while I cot toss
Shots off in my twelve inch ride
You thinking about catching me slipping? Partner I wouldn't try
I got a forty and when I'm in the fifty I dump and go zero to sixty, swiftly
Skurt skeet with Bart and Keak
Getting further from the scene while I'm mobbing with my heat
I sleep with a toy 'cause I don't trust no-motherfucking-body boy, I'm a cutthroat

Fruity ass niggas sweeter than the exit
Get slapped and cussed out like a bitch get
A Cutthoat girl, just ain't simplistic
Knew about the war when I enlisted
Fought hard for the gravy that's on my biscuit
Now I eat crab and grilled beef brisket
Can't deny this salvia on my dick tip
Or the lipstick, Backwoods got me lifted
I'm gifted, every show I ripped it
Stayed on course while you others drifted
Or rims put them on a Benz and dipped it
Or the studio with Coolio Da Cryptic

Starting player while you niggas is benching

Fuck a thought if it ain't beneficiary
Experience be the teacher here
Niggas queers, bitches that's scary
I'm in a hurry trying to scrape up a treaty
Wreaking havoc on your building
I'll duct tape your girl and your children
Get the cash and a whole half a bird I'mma steal it
If lord willing  no killing
I'mma leave no feelings for these bleezy's
I ain't  shiesty and pricey
Show them, have my way
A nice little black bitch with ass and some 
I'm likely trying to toss dick and back her face
No chase, straight laced, from the gates we silent
And no haste and straight waste if it ain't paps or profit

One more time
Servin it, cuz you deservin it
Ya know I've been gone for a long time
Put it down somethin special
The game I spit is fat like Oprah
Got more soul than deep fried Oklah
Dope like China White
Not like dynamite
Blowin up the spot cuz dude, I'm kinda tight
Raps flow fat like beer from cake taps
Slap them saps and give dabs to big mac
Seasoned veteran this game I'm indulgin
Pockets bulgin from bankin trojans
Love my grip but don't trip off ghetto freaks
Kill for skrill but chill deep in them ghetto streets
Dodge and duck when police chase me
Sharp as Fuuuck, cuz OGs lately
Me and my mic is like gin and soko
Dunk and yako
Foot in sock oooh, you didn't know
Well peep this mane
And recognize Mac Dre is the name
I step to the mic with intent to lace those
Who lack the nack to mac stack and break hoes
I come raw
But keep it oh so real
I got the kind of game to make a female kill
And I go deep up in some chassey
Doggy style like that mutt called lassey
They all chase me, like cat chase mice
And I play them, like fools play dice
I'm what is known as the play B-O-Y
Some people trip cuz Dre be so fly
I stay dipped like them fools from G-Qs
Step into the party and they all say he's cool

My lyrical content is deep like a good book
I serve flavor, just like a good cook
Grab a mic and ill at a party
Rap so good I send chills through your body
Rhyme style
Tight like coochie, rolled like sushi, funky like voot said
And top notch is what they rate Dre
Cuz I got more rhymes than food at Safeway
So make waaay
For the M-A-C
As I put the Crest Side on the M-A-P
I got more game than that fool cat, say Jack
I'm a G, a player from waay back
Skill superior, far from inferior
Got the pimp shell with the gangsta interior
And with the broads I'm smooth as suave son
And when it's funk I get the job done
So don't underestimate the great Mac
Cuz I make raps, and pimp to make laps
I hate saps
Can't stand a smurf, definition of smurf
Sucka mark in a church
I purr
Off cavasi yak
Slightly heated with a gram on yeah

And a couple of boss hookers

Man, them bitches is gonna be out there hoeing
And me, I'm gonna be on this mic flowing
And the Cutts is gonna be collected from niggas that's owing
Nigga, you ain't knowing, I gets mine
I did too much time to be wasting time


You must didn't understand what I was talkin' 'bout
When I said ""get in the game, get rich, and get out""
Now you're stuck in it, don't got no luck in it
Trying to put the whip on it and extra stuff in it
Partner, I reckon if you put on some of these pimp glasses
And take a couple of these pimp classes
You're gonna realize life moves fast
And you don't get too many chances",https://genius.com/Mac-dre-out-there-lyrics

Them calories, they keep my pockets fat, I got to stack a grip
Try not to trip, and keep them gold diggers off my dick

Got to help my partner’s in the pen 'cause they living broke
This ain’t no joke, on parole and I can’t smoke
No sticky indo, roll down the window
'Cause if I breathe the tac it's back lights like Nintendo
Got to play the game like a professional
If you ain’t having money I got to let you go
I need to let you know the rules before you infiltrate
Rule number one, partner, never should you pimpatrate

Somebody better tell them punks, I ain't for it
Say the wrong thing, mayne, you're paying for it
I can't enjoy it, every time I'm out, y'all
Like three strikes, gotta put niggas out, y'all
About y'all chicks with no cash
I'd rather have one with some and no ass
I ain't on thizz tonight (I ain't on thizz tonight)
I'm on yo' bitch tonight (I'm on yo' bitch tonight)
Man, shes tryna leave with me

Rapper Gone Bad,Rapper Gone Bad,1999.0,"I'm a young gifted and black mack, rap sweet like candied yams
And I make you put your fist up to your mouth and say, ""Goddamn!""
Boy, I got heat, flame-o, pour like liquid Drano
Verbal volcano, they love me, 'cause they know
I'm cut from the cloth that real men are made of
Bitches get sprayed up with clips of this Bay love
Attackin you with vernacular, dialect and lingo
The Rapper Gone Bad, boy, peep the first single
Bounce and shake what your mammy gave you
It's the Dre-pors, can you feel it? Nothin can save you
From the dapper rapper who stay fitted like a mannequin
Hoes see me in the traffic and say, ""Girl, there go that man again""
I'm fabulicious, game nutritious
Break bitches like dishes and drink like them fishes
Boy, put some of that Yukon Jack in the bag
And come fuck with yo' partner, the rapper gone bad

(Rapper gone bad)
(Ra-ra-ra-ra-rap) 
(Rapper gone bad)
(Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad...rapper gone bad)
(Bad-meaning-bad)
(Bad, bad, bad...rapper gone bad)

I'm an old schooler like Grandmaster and the Five that was Furious
Got bitches goin delirious even though it ain't that serious
You're curious? Well, listen to these lyricals
Them suckers tryin to knock this, it's gonna take a miracle
I'm seasoned with the game that O.G.'s told me
Got laced like Luke did by Obi-Wan Kenobi
Or Yoda, hold a mic in my right hand
And when I'm sleep you know I keep a fat strap in my nightstand
That's right, man, my hypeman is L-O-double T
Might see us after the show at the hotel DoubleTree
Cool, calm and collected, but sometimes I get mean
'Cause suckers sick of the scene like they Jack and I'm the Green
Giant, defiant, bitches get dealt with quick
Can't be on this ball team unless you wanna help get grits
Let's get rich, is what I tell em, sell 'em dreams like horoscopes
They try to fight the feeling, but it's hard to ignore your folks
Mac D with the R connected to the E (me)
Might be at the bar drinkin' Hennessy
In between the sheets I'm a freak and a cold piece of work
My body over her body like Johnny, Keith and Levert


I'm a thug like 2Pac, born to mack like Too $hort
Smoke punks like Newports, get drunk off two quarts
Bendin' corners in somethin' ninety-new
Lookin' real ragooey on my way to see 
Chuy
Boy, I'm on the air gettin' heavy rotation
But I'm still a player with a Chevy on Daytons
I'm hi-po, and the five-o really can't stand me
Got posse, Flowmasters, a shift kit in the tranny
Chirpin' every time I shift gears
In that 9-5 Impala with them gold-dipped gears
Put some of that 1-5-1 in the bag
Come fuck with yo partner, the rapper gone bad",https://genius.com/Mac-dre-rapper-gone-bad-lyrics

I gives a fuck if u a dime, I still call you a bitch
You'll probably see us in the club 30 deep equipped with clips
And hella whips outside talkin' shit
We don't pay to get in nothin', rush the door so quick
21 with no sense, security guard so tense
'Cause we hyphy, ain't no tellin' what we might do
The light bright red but we still slidin' through
Hypnotiq got me cool, pills, popped about two
We done smoked about a quarter now already, what it do
I don't know about you but I'm feelin' myself
Whoa, let me calm down, i'm killin' myself
No, I get stupid so I gotta keep on
I could last about a week long 'til my battery gone
Six hours then I'm charged and I'm back in the zone
Back in the zone, get stupid, show 'em how we actin' at home

Get stupid, go dumb (Repeat 8X)
We some stunnas, y'all some runnas
Now get stupid, go dumb

Body in a dump, nigga; you don't want no funk, nigga

What We Do,The Rompalation,1996.0,"Ay, check this out, right, who we got in here, cuddie?
We got the Romper muthafuckin’ Room in this muthafucka
Crew Thang and the Five-Trey-Fizzive
Strictly SES, straight from the muthafuckin’ Crest
That’s right. Mac muthafuckin’ Dre is in this
Coolio, you know, Da’Unda’Dogg
That’s right. Mac muthafuckin’ Mall
And the Sugawolf Pizzimp
Not the pimp…what about PSD a/k/a Stevie D, bitch
Oh, y’all didn’t know?
This is what we do…

My lyrical flow got me dwellin’ up on the past
Servin’ ‘em on that ass, gettin’ my cash, comin’ up fast
And’ll blast you in a minute, drama, quick to jump up in it
So end it ‘fore you begin it ‘cause I’m down to represent it
And’ll send you higher to your Messiah once I open fire
At your own desire I’ll flat you like a tire
Wire me a kite if you full of fright, that electric sight
Ain’t no joke, niggas be comin’ up short thinkin’ they gonna fight
Talkin’ about that weed, servin ‘em sacks of indo; what you need?
All of my homies keyed, niggas free from the life of greed
Twisted up on the mixes, won’t you fix us niggas somethin’ to drank
Can’t get enough dizank up out the bizank, got put in my tank
Bitches be wantin’ my riches and they bitches, man, be jockin’ my switches
Pullin’ around my riches which is cool
Because I get ‘em, and then I hit ‘em
You see this what we do when we doin’ what we do

She wants to get married but I ain’t and I cain’t
‘Cause I’m sprung on my muthafuckin’ dank and some drank
I got a fat bank, huh, and still break hoes
And if your bitch gets to jockin’, I will break yours
The Mac named Dre from the C-R-E-S-T
Ask about a nigga and they all would say ‘Yes, he’s the shizit’
I gizit, much pussy on my dizick
Never would I lizick or pay like a trizick
I’m like that, potna, I thought you heard
Fuckin’ with your brain like some Thunderbird
I’m doper than a joint of that potent dank
And funky like the county jail holding tank
Romper, Room, crew for life
If I thrust ya once, hoe, I’mma thrust ya twice
What is I’m sayin’ on this microphone
I get Romped out when my mic is on

I make the Statue of Liberty get freaky
Scoot her panties over, play with her pussy
Make her pay me to jook me
Playa playa, oh hell yeah, motive be to skeet her
Menage a trois, you, her and I, bubble while you G her, yeah
A Crew Thang nigga keepin’ it real
Up against it with my protégés reachin’ for mills
We puts the pussy-whip in ill fashion
And bend a corner hella squatted with that skrill flashin’
(What you squattin’?) A Mitsubishi, 2-triple-zero GT
VR 4, Nike shoe to the floor
If it’s not relatable to dollars I can’t holla
Tryna prosper, turnin’ down nothin’ but collars
That’s what we wantin’, hutch, I strut with a limp
Through the party off Bacardi with the Shug’Wolf Pimp, ugh
PS to TS, Country Club Creezest
We just gon’ tear the roof off this bitch

Now it’s the hog in your dog speakin’ once more
Crestsidin’ through the door, and pimp a hoe more
Than them hoes they be frozen, jockin’ on a player
Hollerin’ ‘Pimp ‘til I die, runnin’ game like the mayor’
Extreme heavy hustler, stack a chip fiend
In the game of the big dogs, mutts and the fleas
But G’s like me, we pimp and don’t slack
Stack G’s for my neez, fetti fiend for the scratch
Bitch, I’m hustlin’ hard
So now they wanna put the Mac down and bogard
But I won’t let ‘em, known to sweat ‘em for the green when I mack
‘Cause I hound dog hoes and sho’ won’t slack
It’s SugaWolf Pimp in me
Nothin’ but the muthafuckin’ Mark Street G
Servin’ this game like a thang of the ‘caine somethin’ serious
Comin’ like dick, mayne, flowin’ like a period

1:40 in the morning, Brougham reekin’ of the rope, see
All my cuddies high and so am I so peep game I be bold
These hoes is on some muthafuckin’ alien shit
But me and Kill-a-Hoe won’t peel a hoe, push her off a cliff
Ripped off Hennessy, trick bitch, I’ll slap ya head off
And if your nigga move, Crestsiders gon’ dump that lead off
Your man is a midget, he like to floss and trick bread off
But hoe I’m from the North and fa sho’ you gotta get off
See I’m a third generation Mac
I like my hoes hella thick like the trunk on my Cadillac
But bitches on me like Prozac
Oh, you didn’t know that little hoe was sessed out like that?

Bitch, I thought you knew
Comin’ straight from the Crest, this is what we do",https://genius.com/Mac-dre-what-we-do-lyrics
FortyTwo Fake,Rapper Gone Bad,1999.0,"(chorus)
Homegirl said, Mac Dre come through
(She told a nigga to come through)
Let me whoop this puss on you
(You can't whoop that puss on me)
Ain't no ho puss worth my life
(Ain't no puss worth my life)
I ain't know this ho was shiest
(I didn't know the ho was shiest)
(verse 1)
I met her on a Thursday at the DMV
She was payin' registration, I was tryin' to get an I.D
Didn't trip 'til she talked intellectual
And the way she moved was hella sexual
I threw bait, strictly experimental
Dropped my pencil made it look accidental
She bit quick like a big mouth bass
And when she picked up my pencil all I saw was ass
I said what's your name, she said my name's LaShawn
I said excuse my ebonics, but baby you the bomb!
She smiled, told me I was far from ugly
Asked me how I was doin', I said lav lav lovely
Looked at my watch, said my schedule's tight
But if you give up the number I'll call your ass tonight
Right
She was with it and gave up the digits
And when I called later on she said come visit
(chorus)
(verse 2)
Who is it? She said when I knocked on the door
I said it's young MD, oh, you ain't knowin'
Stepped inside and I could tell from a distance
She was burning scented candles and maybe even incense
Boy, I tell ya, she was in the mood
She said, I hope you're hungry 'cause I cooked up some food
She lit the fireplace, threw on a love ballad
Before the main course we ate shrimps and salad
We talked for a while and drank Zinfandel
She had ass like ten games of big pin the tail
On the donkey
Chocolate, opposite from honky
All I can think about is hittin' that monkey
(chorus)
(verse 3)
She was diggin' your folks, boy I could tell
How she served fat steaks and big lobster tail
On the first visit, everything exquisite
The door bell rang, she didn't ask who is it
She must've knew dude, 'cause she gave him some cash
He kicked down a twomp sack and a fat gram of hash
We smashed, we turned joints to doobies
She eightysixed the music and pulled out three movies
Mahogany, The Mack, Baby Got Back
She said, I'll be right back, roll the rest of that sack
I rolled the weed up, then I kicked my feet up
Then two niggas came in with masks on, G'd up
The plot thickens, I'm slippin' like a muthafucka
Mopped and chopped and gettin' treated like a sucka
Five minutes ago, I was finna fuck great
But now I'm gagged up, wrapped in duct tape
They choked me, broke me, and dropped me off on the bridge
And all I can think about was killin' that bitch
My worst mistake, fuckin' with a snake
How a playa gonna fall for that Fortytwo Fake?
That Fortytwo Fake

Everybody ""fa sheezy"" and ""off the heezy""

But that's no justification for rhyme-stealin'
Just when I thought it was safe to come tighter
Ooh-fuckin'-wee, another biter
He steal, but still, there's no M.C. coppers
So steal, I drill, will treat niggas like caca

And I'm not diggin' this, it's gettin' outta hand
Any chance I can, I'ma shit on a man

Pull him over, make him take a rap-a-lyzer
He's bitin' my rhymes like appetizers
Put him in jail, throw away the key
He's a two-bit, no-good, sucka M.C
And he's fuckin' with me, M.D. the Great

Sweet as cake, as soft as they make

But these saps eat 'em up like Pac Man dots
Make him stop, he's killin' me
Gonna make his career disappear like Bill Bellamy's
You don't know, I'm sellin' these, niggas spittin' felonies
Fool, I'm makin' hella Gs, 'n' you bitin' these like celeries
I'm pullin' blankets off the niggas that's fakin' sauce
See you in the streets, then you beat, fool I'm takin' hearts

Polo cologning while you nigga's perfuming

Campaign with this game man, like Truman
Puffing a Cuban, fucking with Rueben
Stay in a trap bumping, just saying, where you been?
I'm grooving, moving with Gucci on my shoes
Braking then cruising, the coochie I'm abusing

I got three rules when I hustle and ain't nann one funny

Can't be no punk and damn sure can't be no ho
I'm like the Grand National, they don't make them like me no mo'

I pops extra hard 'cause I know talk is cheap
Tell a ho toss it in the air, whatever stay, she keeps

Down and dirty, low to the ground like frog nuts
Keep a ho bottom lip hanging like a turtleneck sweater
Love a freaky lizard who can give bomb headers

Waiting for a super bad to come wet my whistle

Quickly pop my collar, and tell that bitch I'll holler
It really ain't hard, it's just the pimpin' in his tongue

Fortified with this game like vitamins and minerals
Doper than a bottle of that dog food

Puttin' the crest on the map, like NWA did Compton
Got my finger on the trigger, dont make me pull it and bail
Plus I'm ski masked down, all you see is bullets and shells
From that HK, they say Dre is slightly crazy
But ain't nothin' but the way them crestside streets raised me
I'm shady, all my game make you trust me
Players love me, haters dodge and duck me
They hidin' while I'm ridin, Crestsidin' through the fog
I'm a double R hog, doin' dirt with my dogs
Crest gorilla makin' scrilla, boy I gets G's
Put more holes in a nigga than they put in Swiss cheese

Now check credential, these niggas be killa status
Pack a tech, tote a tommy, you know I brandish
Some dont understand, niggas I hog about my scrillions
Pill young knuckle heads, stoppin by my building
Built in the game, foundated since '74
Its that Mark Ave nigga... You know
Get your millimeter, these niggas round here be heated
And if you need it, eat it up when I feed it
So giddy up, get game, if you ain't knowin' that it'll happen
Thats that real shit... fuck all that rappin'
So go on and ask your folks
'Cause these crest niggas ain't no joke

Pussy ain't the prize so you can miss me with that bullshit
Young hog through the hallways, strapped down with them full clips
Catch 'em on surveilance, a murder thats how I read it
So potna if you saw it, play like you ain't seen it
I'm the cleanest in this murder shit, cuddie who you with?
Represent that Sawyer all star killa clique
Wave both hands and watch me yoked in the stands
This them creepers coward, so could you understand
Faulty information keep on gettin' sold to the FBI
So what you gon' do? big baller dont cry
Everybody in this world can't get by
We love to be high, so pop yo collar, let it go
'Cause this crest creep shit is gettin' sold like blow

Look it, at who just crept up out the bushes
Without warning, swarming in black garments
Performing like an OG, crest vet, oh yes its Naked
But I'm forced to wear clothes, because its cold on the North Pole
This 4-4 got the enemy behind the line
'Cause once they cross it, aww shit, another violent crime
Has been committed in the itty bitty city called Vallejo
All hell breaks loose when you fuck with lou
Me and my people 'cause we deep in this shit
Brought heat to this shit, just in case a hater wanna trip
Off the fact that the country club is in the building
Hit the ceiling with your 3 C's if ya feeling
Where I'm coming from, now who in the fuck you running from
Them cuddie top dogs are on there way and they coming dumb

Hoes they, hoes they love me
'Cause I'm the U-N-D-A-D-O double G
Crestsidin', hittin' switches, let me drop you a line
If you ridin' then you bitches better be on time
You fucking with my pleasures now
In L.A., fuck Da Unda Dogg won't let you down
So let me bust a nut, we creepin', so hurry up get yo ass in this telly
No time for speakin', remove your clothes and lay on your belly
I got that Watts shit, mixed with that Crestside twist
Block shit, bitches love to fuck with this

Reek Daddy the muthafuckin' instigator
Mr. get this shit started right now, fuck later
From the Crest to the muthafuckin' Midwest, Reckless
15 cuddies on a dead nigga chest
Bitch have you ever rolled with a rider?
Bouncin' in the low hollerin' out Crestsider!!
Ripped, dont even trip, its gon' be some more shit
I got the big clip, filled up with hollow tips
Cold Crest creeper and I always keep my cannon on me
Dont forget the dope 'cause I'm a lay you where you standin' homie
Hoe if you know me, you know what I'm about
Act like a snake bit my dick and suck the poison out

Cuddie I go way back, sippin' heem straight like chris mack
In the 'lac, yac up, aliens better back up
Playa like OG bust
See there ain't nothing like that ball hog soup, for country club hog nuts
Smash fools like Barlow, serve big game like tip toe
Might catch me mackin' in Chicago
Smokin' on some ????
Pimp shit, talkin' smooth, armani man, I'm out to conquer the globe
Might start off in Vegas, hookers bringin' more of those papers
Boss mackin' got me scuffin' my gators
Call me Luke Skywalker, the alien stalker
Cuddie, fuck ya friends, ya folks, even ya potna
Lil' soldier got a chopper plus he gone off one
And OG's think the penitentiary is fun
So he's bread to kill, and ain't scared to die

My Folks,Do You Remember?,UnKnown,"I run the streets with cold cats, we perks and smoke fats
We down like four flats, some call 'em my folks, black
Me and my potent crew is tighter than toes in shoes
There's only a chosen few that I might be closer to
We share clothes, hoes and never with closed doors
On folks disclose 'cause close folks'll sure roll
My potnas will lie for me, take that dive for me
My woman'll cry for me but they kill and die for me
We all from the same track, and all used to slang crack
We all got game fat and scrilla remain stacked
My folks is road dogs like Caine and O-Dog
Some others is so-called, friends but go and dog
So I shake the fake, with faith, I stay true
'Cause me and my folks that's close is way cool
My folks

It's a family a-
It's a family affair
(My folks)
It's a family a-
It's a family affair
It's a family a-
It's a family affair
It's a family a-
It's a family affair

Whenever I'm doin' bad, my folks'll gimme cash
Look out for a nigga fast, and man, when it's time to blast
There's never no compromise whenever the drama flies
We makin' some mamas cry, 'cause it's gon' be homicide
So suckas they stay back 'cause they know we stay strapped
And man we go way back like Murray's and wave caps
I've known 'em for hella years, they just like my relatives
And that's what we tell our kids so this'll forever live
My folks is dedicated, ghetto educated
Some people really hate it 'cause they know we can't be faded
We just like the Wu-Tang whenever we do thangs
It's always a crew thang 'cause that's how the crew swang
So if you ain't knowin' me, my folks is royalty
And all that they owin' me is love and loyalty
'Cause we shake the fake with faith and stay true
Me and my folks that's close is way cool
My folks

Non Discriminant,The Genie of The Lamp,2004.0,"I'm so high off the catpiss blunt
In a 745 with the catfish front
The Mac stunts, they fresh bitch
Necklace, hella' ice on my left wrist
Steak for breakfast, big as Texas
Voice-mail full, you can't leave a message
Andre Macassi I got a backhand that get a bitch right
And back on the track man
Fat man, go dumb on a crowd
Go wild showin' our style
You see the outfit, mouthfit
Polo Ralph bitch big screen fat leather couch bitch
Bachelor, ambassador
She said no but I'm still asking her
Harassing her, sweating her to get it
I'm a pimp in a netback fitted

(Blunted) Off a loose, that means money
Bitch goose it, solicit the honey
No juice with the Remy, I'm wino
Non discriminant from black to albino
Play the game from tip off to final
All on a bitch, I'm rich as Lionel
Platinum issue, my diamonds will blind ya'
In search of some raw talent, bitch lemme' sign ya'

Nigga I'm a buy it, if I want it

Hit Arizona, floss in Phoenix
Bitches all on me, a boss in the cleanest
Cough on the penis, bitch suck dick

Plus bitch I'm a hound well rounded
I ran it back while them other clowns downed it
Won't get impounded, fool I kirks out

Figure eightin', skatin', dancin'
Stay at the bar like that fool Ted Danson
Her head's dancin', bobbin' in my lap

On Monday ya might find me in the drunk tank

Shit not poop, gettin' loot like the Maloof's
It's duck duck goose with your girl or your wifey

A jazzy beat for you jazzy fish
Disco niggas
Catch ya at the club buying drinks all that shit
You know, you know the player type
You gonna love this one

Have you ever been over a bitch house to eat and the food wasn't all that good
But the bitch was hella thick
So you didn't even trip
Had your dick brick, hard as wood
Started beating 'em
Thought about eating 'em
But before you got to it started skeeting 'em
Started treating 'em, buying all kinds of shit
Catch you at the mall you start lying and shit
Well if the shoe fits, oops it's, a song about you
Ralph Ralph pimps and the things y'all do
Fool better take off them blinders
Instead of true show them old rewinders
Recognize game you dick bucket lames
Bitch fuel makes my old school swang
Yeah nigga I don't care
I'm a well done pimp, you still medium rare
Still breathing my air? I suggest you Houdini
And disappear like ""I Dream of Jeannie""

Have you ever had a enough to make you break that bread
She lying to your boys about how much you spend
Have you ever had a nigga that was pimp and slick
That broke your pockets, relinquished your whip
Have you ever?
Have you ever girlfriend that you know was  catch you cheating  you think you got
Have you ever had a nigga that was pimp and slick
That broke your pockets, relinquished your whip

They laughing at you dog, like a jokey joke
Pinocchio, that's what they call me
Keep lying to these bitches, and balling
Sometimes you can see yourself falling
No dough ho? Quit calling
They come crawling
Begging for postions
I catch 'em slipping like a fucking transmission
Fuck 'em and diss 'em
Rake 'em and shake 'em
I keep it Cutthoatish, no this ain't no faking
Nathan from Nathan, leaves nathan
Baby got steak 'em, I'm pocket rapin'
Contemplating, a new lick
Bitch got chips she get flicked like Bic
I flip tight shit, nothing but the finest

'Cause I'm the type of nigga that like to smoke perk and toss
Use them Magnum rubbers baby, 'cause they be bigger than the rest
And in case you didn't know me homie I represent the Crest (sida)
Haters be mad at me, I pull bitches with flattery
Have the funk savagely, commit assault and battery
On any man, who think he can serve me some static
Got many friends with mini vans, with fully automatics
Love Evelyn Jones and boy I'm deadly playin' bones
Federales had me gone but now a nigga back at home, it's on
Lip poppin' no stopping panties droppin' left and right
Boy they be jock in, steady shoppin' for sex at night
Old school like Atari and I'm dope on my pen
We be M-A-C-D-R-E aka Silky Slim, from the V
Never drink Haterade, Armani suits tailor made
Quick to shake a blade, and broke bitches I'll never fade
Kick off your Air Maxes relax, just while I bust
'Cause thou shall not have stress, hutch shall not be trusted
Game spicy, like mustard rushed into your cerebellum
Super saucy ex-felon but there's still no tellin'
What that H-O might D-O on the D-low
So we go super hard on broads and play their ass like cards
Can you feel it, nothing can save ya
'Cause this is the season of licks and capers
Unemployment at a record high
People coming, people going who's next to die
I, stay ready with heavy macks and choppas
Tell me can you crack tonight, 
steady tryin' mack some cock
'Cause I'm a 3C Romp there in none higher
Did a fed in the pen cause a nigga wore a wire
But now I'm back, with crates of raps
Ready to break some backs and make fools face facts
Niggas walk around town, jealous with envy
'Cause I stay fitted and getting hoes infinity
Representin' Windy, Sage and Mark

Right about now I'm about to get dumb
I'm a Young Black Brotha from the V-town city
Records from Wauzi, hot dogs from Smitty
My homeboy Cease on a cold Crest cut
To all you bitches, I'd like to say 'What's up?'
Freak females, with fat whale tails
If you wanna real man, baby, come to Vallejo
Three-C down is where I kick at
Yes, baby doll, you know I spit that
Game to your brain, Mac Dre is the name
I have ya fiendin' for my rhymes like a drummer for 'caine
Oh yeah, I'm quite addictive
It's mandatory for me to spit this
Mac Dre, that big old player
So much game I need to run for mayor
Or even President, just livin' large
Ooh, they would hate to see a brotha in charge
Drivin' 'round town with the system jammin'
They wouldn't understand to hear the President slammin'
Where the dead presidents? Oh, I'm stackin' ya
I gotta make me enough to flip a Maxima
Cellular phone, five bedroom home
And a 14-carat gold microphone
I'd like to send a Romp shot to my homeboy D
Put the R to the O to the M to the P
Just a little somethin' to make you bug
Get Romped out and wear a hole in the rug
Whether you're in a car or at a party
Don't be scared to dance like Marty
Put a double Romp boogie in your behind
Pay close attention as I spit this rhyme
I don't drive a Caddy, cause I'm not Betty
Rather side around town in a tight ass Chevy
With two-inch white walls, yea that's right, ya'll
Call me on my beeper, leave a code, I might call
And if not I'll see you in the traffic
On my way to the show to make money and stack it
It's the same everyday, every day it's the same
I'm just a young playa with so much game
Mac Dre, and don't you forget
Fonky, fonky, fonky dope rhymes is what you get from

Mac D-R-E, I'm Mac D-R-E
Mac D-R-E, I'm Mac D-R-E
Mac D-R-E, I'm Mac D-R-E
Mac D-R-E, I'm Mac D-R-E

The Mac, is what my name is
Niggas talk down cause I'm so damn famous
But I ain't trippin', I keep on mackin', I keep on pimpin', and keep on stackin'
Them green dollars that you know I do
Makin' these funky ass songs for you
I went to Claybank for a little more practice
Now that I'm back, ugh, I'm at this
Police still jack, I just laugh
They say 'Wheres the dope?', I say, huh, 'You want an autograph?'
I use a ink pen to sell my drug
I'm gonna keep on writin' for the bitches and thugs
Whether white, black, or Yugoslavian
Give me a drum beat, and we'll be partyin'
I'm just like that, I ain't quittin'
If the bitch is fine, then, huh, I'm spittin'
Cause in a party I'm a horny muthafucka
Girls in tight jeans don't press your luck, cause I'll
Step to ya like I already knew ya
Shoot you to the telly then do ya
Yeah, you know, The Mac is real retarded
About as fonky as a fat man fartin'
I don't slow down, I just speed up
Ayo Mac Dre, fire the weed up
Cause I really flow when my eyes get low
Or I'm really, really juiced at a Mac Dre show
Whatever the occasion, my eyes are red and fat
40 in hand, and best believe I said that
Been an alcoholic since the age of thirteen
Believe me my brotha, I'm a dope fiend
I need Old E, that's my pipe
My mouth is a flame, I heat up the mic
And in a battle, I'm sure to scorch it
And if you're really talkin' shit then I'll straight up torch ya
Me slow down? Huh, I'm from the V-town
I'm bout to heat up, Cease, turn the beat up
Now I'm shoutin' y'all and I'd like to thank y'all
For comin' out, so fire up the dank y'all
And blow the smoke out at the same time
So I can get a 'tact while I'm spittin' my rhyme
I'm outta here, but I'll be back
Listen to this fonky ass drum track
By The Mac, and don't you forget
Fonky, fonky, fonky dope rhymes is what you get from

Back through here, doing something vicious
Spittin' that shit that ya like
You know, this what I want y'all to do
Check this out...

Light yourself a dank joint, letcha mind go
Listen to these lyrics as I let this rhyme flow
I'm funky with this shit 'cause my style is authentic
It keeps them suckas jockin', so my windows stay tinted
I meant it when I said ""I will pimp til I die""
Makin' them bitches cry
And nigga, dont ask me why
I flow that pimp shit 'cause I know that pimp shit
I smoke that hemp shit, not with that simp shit
Stupid doo-doo dumb is the only way I come
Let the track ride, gimme the mic and I'll run
Smooth with the groove like a saxophone
My raps is on, and man, caps is blown
Straight off suckas' heads with the rhymes I shoot
Fuckin' with the bitch if she's kinda cute
I find her loot, I shake the spot
You'll never hear a bitch say I ate the cot
I mack, kick back, and stack that cash
I throw these thangs, fool, don't make me tap that ass
The Mac named Dre is the man for real
Hoes wanna ride in me Sedan DeVille
'Cause I'm a, young playa with that Crestside game
Kickin' the funky shit, making the rest sound lame

And every time I rap, I bust what cha like
'Cause I'm the coldest MC to ever touch a mic
Every time I rap, I bust what cha like
'Cause I'm the coldest MC to ever touch a mic

They trips when I spits 'cause I'm nothing respectable
But still when I spill, boy, I'm nothing correctable
I got raps that make niggas say ""Goddamn
He a fool with the mic in his hand""
I could teach a square everything he's lackin'
'Cause partna, I'm a playa with some uncut mackin'
I spit shit that makes tricks go run and hide
Down them clowns around town, they wonder why
I never give a bitch who ain't rich the time of day
They got me fucked up if they think that I'ma pay
I'ma play, until she's all played out
Have her friends sayin' ""Damn girl, you Mac Dre'd out!""

'Cause every time I rap, I bust what cha like
'Cause I'm the coldest MC to ever touch a mic
Every time I rap, I bust what cha like
'Cause I'm the coldest MC to ever touch a mic

At the drop of a dime, I can rhyme a tight rap
And make a motherfucker say ""Damn, he like that""
Gifted with the tongue that will run for many miles
Gettin' niggas sprung 'cause I come with many styles
Hoes come in rows to get chose, they gettin' wit me
Saying I'm the flyest on the side of the Mississippi
Banned in six states by the surgeon general
I'm known to be addictive, sellin' dope subliminals
And I don't stop servin' like them fools at Denny's
Like Julius Erving, Michael Jordan, and Penny
I go coast to coast with a dose of this realness
Slappin' your brain with this game, can you feel this?
I flow like river water, ain't no nigga harder
Others that was rockin' is forgotten like Jimmy Carter
But I'm gon' be around, just like hand-me-downs
An old-ass playa still pullin' them panties down

And every time I rap, I bust what cha like

With no hesitation, I step to the brizznity
Said, ""How you doin', baby, can I spit at you?
Saucy young tender, can I get at you?""
She musta recognized the potent pimpin' on sight
'Cause she was jockin' MD for the rest of the night
We smoked dank, and drank Tanqueray
I said, ""Baby, are you sure you can hang with Dre?""
With the party still poppin' we shook the spot
Cut to my Brougham and I took the cot
For 25 minutes MD was shovin' it
She was screamin' my name and I could tell she was lovin' it
Cock was thrusted, nuts was busted
In this no good bitch that some nigga trusted
Pulled up my pants and she put on some lipstick
Went back in the party feelin' pimperistic
I couldn't help but notice that this nigga was starin'
I thought he was trippin' off the clothes I was wearin'
But, he stepped to MD and said, ""What's up, punk?
You been fuckin' my bitch and now I want some funk""
I said, ""I'm not with the drama so you can save the theatrical
I macked on your bitch 'cause she appeared to be mackable""
But instead of this nigga being real on a playa
He took a step back and tried to steal on a playa
I said, ""Look fool, nobody smashes Dre
I throw these thangs like young Cassius Clay""
With one blow, I sent the punk to the flo'
And said, ""Get your ass up if you want some more""
These niggas ran up, they musta been his crew
Now tell me what the fuck was I supposed to do?
Cut to the Brougham and got the M-double-8
So I can get these muthafuckas from up out of my face
Let off a rat-a-tat, hopped in my Cadillac
And burned long rubber on them suckas I gatted at
Yeah

I got my choppa on my left with my finger on the trigga
Rollin' in a glasshouse feelin' like that nigga
Suckas started static last night now I'm searchin'
Finna put some work in, 'gnac got me perkin'
Seen a sucka posted with his bitch at the liquor store
Put in the clip and go, didn't mean to hit the ho
Fully automatic Mac-11 spittin' fast
Make sure I get that ass, then I hit the gas
Punch it to the hood, switchin' up now I'm back
Rollin' in the 'Lac, still sippin 'gnac
Rollers to their right get behind me, I don't trip
They lookin' for a nigga in a Chev, I don't slip
High speed chase if they want to harass me
Put the lights on, switch lanes then pass me
Had me kinda noid but no longer am I spooked
And man, like I said, if they jacked me they was juked
Creep to the spot where the homeboys romp
Niggas on the dice gettin' paid shootin' twamps
30 minutes later pockets fat now I'm cool
Steppin' out the house, niggas scream ""Get that fool""
Suckas smash up in the deuce and a squirrel
Three bald heads and a nigga with a curl
Bullets let loose, I get it in the chest
Fools smash off screamin', ""Trick, fuck the Crest""
Waitin' for the muthafuckin' ambulance
Thinkin' to myself: I don't stand a chance
Dizzy and my breathing is impossible
Next thing I know I'm at the hospital
Wakin' up hurt, fresh out the trauma
Lookin' at my bitch, and my baby's mama
They tryna act cool, but I know they hate it
My baby's mama said, ""Damn Dre, you barely made it""
Straight tore back, sore than a muthafucka
Thinkin' to myself: Man, I gotta smoke another sucka
Chillin', illin', back on the street
Strapped with my gat layin' in the back seat
Got a white boy drivin' lookin' like a nerd
Rollin' in a fucked up Thunderbird
Got my gloves on, hoodie and my mask and
Mad than a muthafucka, finna do some blastin'
We hit this dope track like we lookin' for some rocks
And I hop out the back door and quickly get to poppin'
Suckas start droppin', and I stop cappin'
And hop back in, just like nothin' happened
I'm puttin' in work, killin' fools dissin'
A muthafuckin' savage, a nigga on a mission

Fast Money,Rapper Gone Bad,1999.0,"Fast money, might be ya last money
Quick to blast for the cash money
Squabbin' over past money
Lookin' for spots to stash money
Fast money, might be ya last money

Every time I meet a niggaro, they ass wanna hit
And you tell them 'HELL NO!,' they ass go to talkin' shit
I never gave a flyin' fuck on how these niggas feelin'
Just because I let him eat the pussy now he think we dealin'
Slow down honey love, I think you better pump yo' brakes
If you had that feelin' that we was makin' love, that feelin's fake
My pussy's tight, that's why you niggas want to get up in it
Just to talk to me it cost a fee so nigga won't you spend it
Never trust these fools hollerin' they single
Bitches, dont be stupid, they be lyin'
You know these niggas mingle
You bitches got it bad fuckin' niggas on the first night
Then hollerin' that shit about how a man don't treat 'em right
Bitches be talkin' about fuckin' niggas, I'm buckin' niggas
To get closer to me is some lucky niggas with some scrilla
Niggas gotta break me off a lil somethin'
Playas gotta have that money pumpin'
Before we do some grindin' and bumpin'


I'm hungry for the cabbage, a swavage who need the bank
I done sold everything from weed to crank
But now I need to think, how many of my niggas got killed
Blood spilled, done dealed, cap peeled, for that fast scrill
My past will, pin a picture of criminal conduct
'Cause, nigga, when I'm stuck, my trigger comes unstuck
I don't give a fuck, nigga, life is a hustle
If you wanna come up, you got to flex that muscle
Niggas wit little hearts get little bread
Some niggas is satisfied with puss and a little head
'Til it's been said, fuck the bitch, get rich
Be about it, not without it, nigga get yo' grits
But be cautious 'cause it's crosses
Get caught up, brought up on charges and some take losses
Do your thang, sell dope, hit licks
Sometimes it's mandatory to get them quick grits


My nigga Mac Dre sent a kite to me
He was in Lompoc, I was Tehachapi
The letter read: When we hook up we gonna have the fat sacks
(We gon' sell these raps like crack)
Nigga, I make big bread from the night time 'til it's sunny
Real gangsters don't brag about money
Nigga, this game I would love tall deals
Changin' our name from the mafia to corporate
('Cause it's like four in the mornin' in the kitchen, cookin' up dope on the grill)
Nigga, I keeps it real",https://genius.com/Mac-dre-fast-money-lyrics
Shady Times,The Rompalation,1996.0,"What’s happenin’?
Some of that old gangsta, leave a nigga in a ditch type shit, you know?
Yeah
We playas but we gangstas, too, nigga
Mac Dre and Young Web finna put it down in a real way
Check it out

Have a seat, grab a blunt, relax your back
I’mma about to kick some facts to make you feel that you’ve been jacked
I attack, at any cost, without no means
Packin’ AP-9’s, AK’s with infrared beams
It seems some kids up in this game need to be taught a lesson
Nigga, one suggestion: let’s call together a funk session
‘Cause when I bust, I bring major pain
Keith Sweat would wanna cross out in my type of rain
Nigga, my lyrics is something make the others spread the reputation
I’m bustin’ with a sensation that’ll leave you in devastation
Fry like bacon
This money I’m takin’ to fill my pockets
Fools be tryin’ to stop but I be blowin’ up like rockets
Your arm sockets, legs and waist stay left
The only thing this nigga about to meet now is his death
The point I’m makin’ potna is don’t test me ‘cause I’m packin’ a .380
Muthafucka when times are shady

Yeah, Young Web, niggas ain’t knowin’
It can get real funky around here, you know?
So goddamn drastic after I hit a nigga with the plastic, right?
Nigga, I hung that fool off the Carquinez while that gun fell off me and I’m sideways
Yeah, straight gangsta shit, nigga

I’m a skrilla getta, that’ll kill a nigga about grits
And I’m quick to trip and slip on my mitts
And put hands on a snake if I peep some scandal
Beat niggas up just like Frankie Randall
If I can’t handle, that ass from the shoulders
That’s when I dash and get the pistola
You didn’t know a playa had G shit in him?
Well, send a nigga at me, I’ll put three clips in him
So goddamn fast and won’t leave one clue
And be cryin’ at the funeral just like you
I thought you knew, fool, when it comes to this
Gangsta type shit, niggas run from this
I got stripes, stars, bars and medals
For puttin’ in work doin’ dirt in the ghetto
I’m an O.G. and a H-O-G
A muthafuckin’ hog and they don’t wanna see
My vicious tactics ‘cause shit gets drastic
Leave ‘em bleedin’ and blasted, ready for a casket
I’m real with it, and love to ill with it
You trippin’ off Mac Dre? Then potna let’s deal with it
The 707 North Bay soldier
I thought you knew? I know somebody told ya

Yeah, I know somebody told yo’ punk ass
Never no Cutt will lie when the drama flies
Just gon’ be homicides ‘cause we makin’ some mamas cry, you know?
So go get your black dress, bitch, yeah
Because we flowamatic when countin’ C-notes, sucka
Gettin’ skrilla

These muthafuckas best’a recognize that I be packin’ the ammo
Like Commando, then I’ll light yo’ ass like a candle
But I’m Rambo, up on a mission up in the jungle
To knock down a couple of stables and get ‘em for they bundle
I made ‘em crumble, from the parts that I pack
Bustin’ with M-16, Calicoes and Macs
Automatic gats, that’s what I use to kill all gangs
They send in Web ‘cause he’s trained, when I’m let loose, I’m insane
There’s blood stains, ‘cause I was blowin’ up shit from the start
I takes my steps, was smellin’ death and lookin’ at body parts Does this sparks
But I’m the only nigga that lasts
Puttin’ body parts up in caskets and burn ‘em all down to ash
Stupid ass bastards
What you tried to do was unforgettable
Your gun’s quiz was death and it wasn’t even that damn difficult
Nigga, tryna send your damn lady
Web and Dre be packin’ .380s when times are shady

Yeah, when times are shady it goes down
I got my pen foul, the crowd’s runnin’ wild ‘cause the guns *pow*
It’s the AP with the 50-clip and these fools can’t get with me
Young Web causin’ fatalities, nigga, when it gets drippy
Shitty committee, sucka

My style is foul, I break laws, never legal
Glued to the track strapped with my Desert Eagle
Servin’ them suckas, a muthafucka start drama
I might let him live but bust a cap in his mama
Yeah I’m a playa, playa, but playas play with bitches
When it come to them trick snitches my trigger finger itches
Ready to peel a cap off a punk ass, drunk ass
Nigga startin’ static, take his life and his punk ass
Dre is a killa, drug dealer, ex-convict
Suckas say I’m sick, some drop dimes quick
‘Cause I’m an ill nigga and ill niggas kill niggas
Who alert the 5-0 and the money gettin’ real, nigga
Takin’ out cousins, even steppin’ to nieces
Send ‘em to the grave now they restin’ in pieces
I’m 5150, a stone cold J-cat
Jackin’ muthafuckas so my pockets they stay fat
Rappin’ ain’t shit but a slow grind, so I’m
Hittin’ licks quick gettin’ rich in no time
Ask about my work and they say ‘He gets green
Runnin’ up in shit with his AR-15’
The Mac named Dre is a big fool, sick fool
And if you ain’t down then suck my dick, fool
I don’t give a fuck about a nigga or bitch too
I run with a big crew, and yeah, they sick too

Ha ha ha ha, yeah
Y’all put that down
Let them suckas know how it go in that big Bay Area
Pimps, playas, rhyme-sayers, gangstas and big bankstas
Suckas, stay back, ‘cause you know we stay strapped
Yeah, this is Young Web comin’ at that ass for the 9-muthafuckin-6
This is for all the muthafuckin’ Crestsiders, the real riders
To my muthafuckin’ cuddie Young Nico

That’s right, that Rompalation, this D-Con, fool
And that shit is hoodrat party for your mind, nigga
Yeah, can’t fuck with this…or get enough of this
1996 punk bitch
Mac muthafuckin’ Dre is back through here, tearin’ shit up

Meanwhile my freestyles kill yo wrote raps
Fresh cat in net backs no pro backs or throwbacks
I'm slept on but no match, get stepped on like floor mats
I'll cut cut my dreads off get a high top, let 'em grow back
If I wanna I'm gonna, bitch you know that
Fans no I'm fonky they want me on they Kodak
Feds don't want me cuz they know I ain't gone go back
40 toes, four hoes, down like four flats
Bring me back some backwoods baby, four packs
She bought my Jordans in Portland and got charged no tax
I spit fully auto, full throttle with no naps

Hoes ain't dumb they gone come and ho willingly
But broke ones wit no funds is no fun, they killin me
We Heros, when we roll, we roll wit artillary

Young Black Brotha,Young Black Brotha (LP),1993,"Young black brotha can never be a lover
He keeps a joint in one hand and heem in the other
So fly you never see him bummy
He's never had a job and keeps a pocket full of money
Lit lows Daytons and Vogues
A beeper on his belt and a gang of hoes
Been in and out of jail since the day he was ten
The hall, the county, and next is the pen
See he really doesn't know what the game's about
Get in stack a bank and get the fuck out
Because a D-boy's life is cool at first
But in the end it's the pen or even worst a hearse
Young brotha, loves to get keyed
'Cause he feels so good when he's hittin' the weed
He's never been to high school let alone college
And has so much game and to much knowledge
Some call him a sad case but how do they figure
Many wanna be like that young nigga
And its not just him it's another and another
'Cause many of us live the life of a young black brotha

Hes a young black brotha

18 years on this earth and Oakland is my place of birth
And now the big CREST SIDE! is where I stay
Va-lay-ho
Cal-i-fron-ie-ay
Mob shots
Drop tops
Base cocaine and crooked cops
Niggas grindin' to stack a bank
And to flip a fresh load with the candy paint
Some fail and some succeed
Some sell coke and some sell weed
Some pimp hoes
And some straight gank
Any damn thang to stack that bank
Young black brotha he's a business man
Tryin' to make money any way he can
Clockin' hoes, rollin' Vogues
Smokin' the weed that's how it goes
Young black brotha hes doin' it man
Gettin' at a ho with a brew in his hand
He gets the number and then he burns rubber
'Cause he's livin' the life of a young black brotha

He's a  young black brotha
Khayree break it down for me one time

Hoes jock they throw the cock
At a young black brotha rosing to the top
Material stroller pushin' one dollar snakes
And Daytons and Vogues is all it takes
For a young black brotha to peel her like fruit roll
And straight thrust and find him a new ho
Be a Mac nigga a straight Mac nigga
And kick back and let the bank get bigger
Find a million dollar spot but don't get hot
'Cause you'll feel so dumb when you got popped
Peep game and let the shit soak man
Don't be another little dope man
Get in where you fit in if you don't then squeeze
Stack G's, will you please
I'm Mac Dre baby the young black brotha
The young nigga on the album cover
From the Bay boy
Mac Dre boy
The mutherfucking Mac ass play boy
Making dope rhymes another and another

Livin’ That Life,The Best of Mac Dre Volume Two,1997.0,"Up in this muthafucka trippin’, man
Thinkin’ about how it was
Back in the days, you know
Beat soundin’ kinda cool, feelin’ kinda cool
Let gon’ and do somethin’ to this though
Check it out

Once upon a time, my nine stayed in the small of my back
I sold crack and drove a Cadillac
Shot craps, made snaps on the corner by the stop sign
Strapped with my ‘gnac, dank sack and my Glock nine
Kickin’ it with the homies on the grind for cabbage
A Double-R soldier, 3C savage
Runnin’ from the ones with the nightsticks
High-speed chasin’ and racin’ in tight shit
Back in ’85 selling goop was the shit
Wasn’t a thing that them fiends wouldn’t do for a hit
Bitches suck dick, niggas rented they cars
While young players like me became street stars
Glued to the track with a sack and a handgun
Steady sweatin’ sales, stoppin’ cars at random
Runnin’ from the 50, hittin’ fences and hidin’ out
Seven cars deep is how the homies is ridin’ out
House parties pop, stayed packed with hoodrats
Niggas on the mic, drunk, bustin’ them hood raps
Hooked on the dank, Thunderbird we drank
Rollin’ in the bucket with the fucked up paint
24-7 on the hunt for coochie
Sportin’ Troop, Nikes, Fila, and Gucci
Makin’ much money on the dope track
But when the crack slacked then niggas started to jack
Every young nigga tryna stay in the mix
Was breakin’ them tricks and cold hittin’ a lick
Jackin’ became the quickest way to make some mail
But some niggas fell and spent years in jail
Droppin’ nine in the pen tryna make they chest bigger
Some niggas died gettin’ jacked by the next nigga
But that’s the way it goes, you pay the price
When you’re deep in the game, and you’re livin’ that life

Everybody wants a little something
(When you’re livin’ that life)
Cool but you got to give it all
(When you’re livin’ that life)
‘Cause everything in life has a price you’re…
(When you’re livin’ that life)
Livin’ the life, livin’ the life, livin’ the life, oh

I was against all odds, fresh out the womb
My only hope was to soak game, so I consume
While niggas chilled and parlayed, I learned the hard way
Scuffed and roughed up, the game had scarred Dre
Back in the days, all I knew was the hood and rocks
Lookin’ for funk and headed straight for a wooden box
Prone to quick cash and gettin’ the grit fast
Never really trippin’ on how long would shit last
Earnin’ my ghetto stripes from scraps and ghetto fights
Fuckin’ with hoodrats, them tramps and ghetto types
Never givin’ a fuck, nah, not even sometimes
Just havin’ a fun time, runnin’ from one-time
Trippin’, and wasn’t even peepin’ the shit
Slippin’, and steady gettin’ deep into shit
I let the game control me, shape and mold me
Then it treated me coldly, it pimped and hoed me
I was sellin’ the crack but not stackin’ a damn thang
And now that I look back, man it’s a damn shame
Couldn’t recognize there was game to peep
The dank had me gone and my brain is sleep
I finally woke up in the federal pen
Broke than a muthafucka beggin’ for ends
I was a midget, a small digit…forgotten
Game was stale, my name was rotten
Had life by the ass, my shit was twisted
I thought about the hood and how much I missed it
But the life I was livin’ wasn’t really shit
I was clockin’ them ends but wasn’t stackin’ a grip
They had the world thinkin’ I was runnin’ in vaults
I reassessed my thoughts, and proved my faults
And for the next four years, I kicked and waited
Becoming top notch while incarcerated
But that’s the way it goes, you pay the price
When you’re deep in the game, and you’re livin’ that life


Livin’ that life
Growin’ up in the hood, slangin’ that cocaine
Fuckin’ with them hoochies
Runnin’ from the rollers
Goin’ to juvenile hall, county jail, penitentiary
All that shit
But you gotta pay the price, when you’re livin’ that life
If you’re soft, homeboy, think twice
It ain’t nuthin’ nice

We just doin’ this shit",https://genius.com/Mac-dre-livin-that-life-lyrics

So-so dope

1991 can’t leave my house without packing my gun
'cus nowadays things ain't so clean
You either end up dope dealing or being a dope fiend
Too much stress on a young man’s brain
Smoking that dank to deal with the pain
Much love for the brothers in the crew
But who in the crew will be here in ’92?
Every damn day I see more
Brothers getting killed or thrown in a trunk
Dope fiend mothers sellin sex
Welfare mother’s waiting for checks
Pops in the bathroom shooting Hop
Tell me, my brothers, where does it stop?
I got to get a grip, can’t let it phase me
I’m staying strong, 'cus times are getting crazy

Times are getting crazy {crazy, crazy, crazy}
Times are getting crazy
Times are getting crazy
Times are getting crazy
Times are getting crazy {crazy, crazy}
Times are getting crazy!

Brothers search hard for that perfect life
5 bedroom home, 2 kids, and a wife
Dog in the back by the swimming pool
Everybody wants to be living cool
But, to have these things you must have hope, mayn
Can’t get wrapped up in the dope game
It ain’t cool, you better stay far
Life is much more than brains and a car
Girls having babies before it’s time
Getting pregnant and don’t have a dime
THINK, baby, don’t be a fool
You better wait until things get cool
Keep a hat on a young man’s jimmy
It’s safe sex, but you don’t hear me
Wake up, you can’t be lazy

Pick up a pen and write some music

I did the thing in the pen the whole time I was in
I stayed soaking up game and steady pushing my pen
I read about shit I never knew existed
Before I went to jail I had the whole thing twisted
But now I knows and I'm finna expose
What really goes on behind closed doors
Them devils got a plot that'll shock the nation
To control black power and population
Snake motherfuckas been running the game
That all started off with crack cocaine
They flooded neighborhoods where the black folks dwell
Got everybody using and trying to sell
When drug dealing increased then the killings increased
Then more young black brothers came up deceased
Senseless violence invaded the streets
They had us killing each other but we couldn't peep
We was pawns in the game that the fools created
And this is what they did to keep things shaded
In 1985 they launched the War on Drugs
Claiming they'd get rid of all the killers and thugs
But this was Phase 2 of a fat plan
To control the population of the black man
Even back then, it didn't seem right
When them racist police got the green light
In Chicago, Miami, Atlanta GA
Little Rock, Louisville and the OAK
New York, Minnesota, and all them places
Young brothers got stuck with dope cases
To the public they looked like heroes
While young brothers looked like zeroes
They took black men from black ladies
'Cause with less black men
There's less black babies ain't it shady?
It gets way deep
Phase 3 is the plan to keep us off the streets
They stuck us in jail and said now that we got y'all
Let us introduce you to this crack law
Now everybody knows what the crack is
In them ghetto neighborhoods where the blacks live
Crack is coke cooked in baking soda
But no matter how you cook it, it's still yola
But the courts got laws that punish folks
A 100 more times than powdered coke
You ask why? Well I'm goin' tell it
They charge more for crack
Cuz black folks sell it
Is it justice or is it just us?
And them devil motherfuckers against us
Our future lawyers and presidents
Got cold prison cells for residence
And them young black souljas with brave hearts?
Is filling up the cells and the grave yards
And the black queen? She also losing
'Cause she turn to theft and prostitution
To support a habit that's part of a plan
To regulate the status of the black man
Will it change or will we all remain
Some motherfucking pawns in this game?

Dre have you ate yet? How's bout a dinner date?
Hmmm I don't know, let me check my scheggie
I'm free at 8:30 pick me up when you reggie
Hopped out the Chevy
So I can freshen up
Rolled a sack in the back and put my weapon up
Poured a glass of 7-up
And ate a quick snack
Salami and swiss, piled on a Ritz crack
Called the puck bitch back
Wassup Alice?
She got the mad and said, My name's not Alice!
Alright Alice, pick me up at my palace
I stay in Westlin, I know you know where that is
That's where my dad lives, be there in a jiffy!
Threw on some 150's and my red Ken Griffey
Tee shirt crispy
I'm dipped as usual
Shave with the Andes
Electric, reuseable
Threw in my removeable iced out grill
So when I spit my spill it's chillie-chill
I'm really ill, really feel
Really Mac-ish
I'm waiting on a bitch
And I'm puffin on some cactus
Damn where you at bitch?
I started thinking
Baby pulled up in an Aviator Lincoln
Grab me thump tank
Cause they won't catch me leakin
Cause pucks hang and try to bang
Every weekend
I started speakin

I said, Where we eatin?

I said, To hell if we are! I'd rather Benny Honnas
She said, What's that for?

I gotta stop when the song end

Spoke Japan Give me moo-goo-guy-pan
Ate drank got full and burped
I said, Alright you beezy it's time to kirk
Dipped to her spot that was tucked in the cut
Put dick threw the cot and i busted a nut
Then I busted a nut, one mo again
Then I busted a nut, on the ho chin
Now here we go again
Another fiasco
I'm diggin her out

Fuck being bashful
Baby I'm a bash-pro

My Chevy,Young Black Brotha (LP),1993.0,"(“I be straight Chev’ strikin’”)
(“Money-makin’, hoochie-sinkin’ Crestside playa”)

I roll a ’73 Chevy Caprice
Straight stocked out hubcaps and elites
A four-door mob shot, that’s what I got
Burn a little rubber on a punk ass sahob
A fat ass fleet that’s pumpin’ the beat
A Zapco board to make things complete
I ride and side, whip and dip
Spotted in the seat with a joint on my lip
Ready to take the cops on a high-speed chase
Put up your pink slip ‘cause I’m ready to race
Man, I’m so tight, I just blow right
Past a muthafucka and yes his hoe might
Flag me down the next time she see me
But flaggin’ down Dre ain’t that easy
Steady lookin’ out for the black-and-white ones
So I can hit the gas, swing some tight ones
In my mob shot Chevrolet, I roll every day
And bullshit tapes I’ll never play
I bump $hort and Spice, and MC Pooh
That gangsta shit, I thought you knew
Man, I’m so cool, in my old school
Steady pullin’ bitches when I hit the high school
Short and tall, light and heavy
They all wanna ride in my Chevy

Fuckin’ ‘em up like that there, you know. Can’t fuck with us, man. They can’t fuck with us, man. We got too much game, mayne.)
(Alright, Khayree, bring that shit right back. Straight from the Crestside, it’s young Mac Mall.)
(“Money-makin’, hoochie-sinkin’ Crestside playa”)

Catch me in the traffic, it’s Mall comin’ through in a ‘74
I’m known to blow your doors on the sideshows
With the shift kit tranny, nigga, what you think?
Put your mail with your mouth and we can race for bank
And on a full tank, watch how hectic I get
Strikin’ with the SES when I’m tacked from the chronic
Ride slow just like the comp on the elites
And I’mma fuck ya dome when I see you in the streets
But in the driver seat, stride way too low, fool
When I strike, I watch what your hoe do
Trick I know you hate the SES crew
We straight Chev’ strikin’ on these punk ass niggas too
Fool, what you know about the Strictly SES soldier?
Fuckin’ with the doja, it might have me in a coma
Nathan nice from the north of the Valley Jo
Chronic, Old Gold, spittin’ game to pimp, playas and the hoes
Known to live illegal but Feds never find a trace
Never Captain-Save-a-Hoe, playas never wear a cape
Never rappin’ fake and we zappin’ across every state
Comin’ up is my fate, so punks love to playa hate
But see I never trip because the Chev' is lookin’ hella whipped
Every nigga and they bitch is sprung on this playa shit
So when you see me, man, punch it
Because the squad is in the town with the Zapco adjusted
Fifteens bumpin’ as I hit the highways on the turf with Smurf
Hittin’ the block sideways
And I can swing it five ways, danked, always in a daze
Rollers try to fade, but trick I’mma stay paid
Fools try to ride, they know they ain’t ready
The marks claim they mobbin’ but they ain’t strikin’ them Chevys, mayne
We strikin’

What's happening playa, just sitting here, you know
Putting together some of that ghetto gumbo, you know
Some motherfucking gumbo?
Yeah nigga, gum in the mother fuck bo
Like that there?
Yeah, I got my niggas in here, we finna put it down
You know what I'm saying, real, real special
You know? Check it out, like this here
Verse1(Mac Dre)
As I get to bustin'
This introduction
Of mind corruption
And rhyme seduction
I steal and fill brains
With game and mo' thangs
Like them dope thangs
And what that hoe brang
Creep on Crest streets
Speak on fresh beats
Hit the motel, and freak on fresh sheets
And wet sheets, is the end result
Been killing long cock since ten years old
See I blend this old-game with this new
And ain't no telling what a bitch will do
Now picture you
In my position
Steady getting sweated by the opposition
Could you handle
All this scandal
And keep on stepping like boots and sandals
My handle, is young Mac Dre
Silky slim, is my A.K.A
And you know that bay is my rompin' grounds
I mean stompin' grounds
But I like the way Rompin' sounds
So I'ma keep it
Romp related
And if it ain't down with the romp, I hate it
Verse2(JT the Bigga Figga)
Well let me jump into the pot with all the hustlers and players
Chop potatoes with Phillie faders,Knocking niggas with Tre Eights
But now I
See my niggas at the spot with the session
Illegal product
Then people plotted, rotted with no confessions
Smith and Wessons
Demonstrations with Fully Autos, actin'
Conversations at the lab to keep the trackers trackin'
Double backin' to the spot where all the money filter
Keep it on the down low
You never tell about your scrilla
On the reala
I breaks it down in all directions
It's the Fillmoe players with the O
And the Crest connection
All in the session with my folks, You know they got the Dolo
Hit the gateway tracks, like some fiends in a forward Volvo
Bought a Bolo
Seen Kelly, mashed off, and then we hollered
Trailing Coolio and Mac Dre in a green Impala
Getting cloudy
The laboratorys just like a porny
Got a patient
Cousin Quinn is making the shit get saramani
Hella fetti
We ready, steady, with all the bumbles
Keeping it real with Dangerous Dame and Mac Mall in this fucking gumbo
Straight paper
Straight fetti
Straight gumbo
Verse3(Dangerous Dame)
Niggas we pull
Niggas will say so
We hit the strip from San Jose, to Vallejo
Make more scrilla by the mouth piece
Non-talking niggas don't know shit about me
Ignore 'em like bitches
Respect
There ain't a hand out
Like a sore thumb, fake niggas always stand out
Player hater prayer
Praying that I buckle everyday
Ain't worth five cents, or my knuckles to the face
But my burners ain't feeling no flesh
If you niggas wanna test
Let it jump and we could put the shit to rest
You thinking deeply
But I be on service like a shark
Consider me that hate, but see I serve you from the heart
'cause love loves me
And hate loves me
So what the fuck you think?
You can't fuck with me
You paying dopefiends, to put 'em to work
But now your money's gettin' low
While I be getting low with this wicked flow
You got at me last night
But I wasn't asking who was bustin' the trigger
I'm blowing big bomb smoke, yelling ""Nothin' ass nigga""
My pimping ain't soft
I'm taking no losses
So why the hell do you persist to put me in crosses?
You thought it was shackles, but then they was ropes
And now they're spider webs
I broke on you hoes
I know what you're doing before you do it
Got an outside plan, but in the end you're looking stupid
Huh, yeah
'Cause Dangerous Dame got 'em riding on the freeway
Actions speak louder
I don't fuck with he say-she say
Think you got game?
Never could you have it
You niggas are crying wolf, while I'll be fucking Jessica Rabbit
Straight trading places
But fool this ain't no dream
You was happy as hell when you had me under your infra red beam
Once again, get low for the East O
Add a little recipe to the gumbo
Verse4(Da Unda Dogg)
Add me
Mix me up
Stir me in the pot with these niggas that fix me up
See, back in '91, Coolio was the shit
So now we cooking a batch of gumbo and it ain't gonna quit
My nigga the Bigga Figga, adding that spice so fool it's saucy
You bitches thinking you'll eat for free, well this shit is costly
So back up off me
And recognize the sound is poppin'
Beause we steadily droppin' dope, like the keys you coppin'
Mother fuckers, they get to actin foul
When they know they can't fuck with the style
Smile punk mother fucker, sucka, hating bustas
Ain't no friends when it comes to ends, so you can not trust us
But trust me
You can not dust me, or try and bust me, dumbo
Your ass gets heated in this pot of gumbo",https://genius.com/Mac-dre-gumbo-lyrics

I grew up in the Bay Area around a gang of robbin and shootin
Looked up to legends like Felix Mitchell, Huey P. Newton
And Todd Shaw a/k/a Too $hort
Blowin big hashish with dank that'll make you choke
Young Mac Dre, causin' major damage
Back in the days I tossed hoes in the back of my ham sandwich
Grown, gone on bomb seedless hemp
Hound for potential prostitutes who need a pimp
But now I'm bendin' corners, fresh out the rallies
Chokin' on roper in the back of Denali's
Drinkin' that snake bite, Yukon Jack
And boy, I ain't right without my strap
'Cause them cutthroat bandits will split yo' wig
In the streets of Killafornia, ya dig?
It's goin' down, dog, I'm in your town, dog
Got to let your peeps know how I clown, dog
In the end get it, comin' with that Blackhand sound
You thinkin' I can't clown? Let me put my mack hand down

 How yo hood look?
 It's full of gangsters, fool
How yo' hood look?
 It's full of gangsters, son
You can catch me on the Eastside, doin' my thing
 Or you can me in New York, boy, it's all the same

I'm from the Eastside, where the thugs, they shed blood for nothin'
After the club you get it in your mug if you frontin'
We gangbang, it's just that our slang's a little different
Aim a little different, spit game a little different
Got in with the Mexicans, pricin' them things a little different
Same kinda crooks, but we cook up bricks a little different
Them old school Chevrolets, dot-six Range a little different
Y'all gats and guns the same, but we blow brains a little different
Them drive-by's, we walk-by's, some die a little different
Lie a little different, testify a little different
Y'all trees ain't got seeds, y'all beez a little different
The D's is different, my P's a little different
Y'all sell bricks, we break it down, get cheese a little different
Y'all hate narcs, we hate cops, we eat a little different
Y'all got strips, we got spots, our blocks a little different
It get hot a little different, fools get knocked a little different
When the feds came, yo Dre, they took the whole block to prison
My man pops was snitchin', his face chopped in Clinton
If you got change and the gear hot, then switch spots, get missin'
Yo' hood ain't no different, my hood ain't no different


In my neighborhood everybody thuggin'
Hoodrats steady gettin' dug in
Fools buggin', mean-muggin'
Later on you seem 'em nuggin'
Dre, I play my hood all day
Seen a fool get killed in broad day
Thugs get money from the hallway
2 for 5, the tall way
Ghetto slang, ghetto game
We all just doin' that ghetto thang
Run around totin' them metal thangs
Really, homeboy, it's all the same
Your hood is like my hood, son
Anywhere you go thugs pullin' guns
Gangbangers, ghetto birds
Your hood is like my hood, ya heard?
Me and Killa finna let you know
How to put a lick down and get some dough
From your hood to Mexico
'Cause it's all about that paper, though
Put me up with Vallejo hoe
That puff on hay, stay on the low
Dre got work, 800 a O
Eastside thugs make money, you know?
I don't care where we at
Just as long as we keep smokin' fat
Get a fifth of Heem and hopin' that
Everybody wanna stay chokin', black
I told you, Dre, our hood ain't changed
Duckin' em well, slingin' em things
Fools rock Rolies and diamond rings
Respect the game, our hood's the same",https://genius.com/Mac-dre-how-yo-hood-lyrics

Urkel niggas soakin every line, still ain't with the verbals
Get to hoppin' hurdles like Jesse Owens in the fast
Return-type tactics so quick shakin' that past
In they entourage bitches be hazy like the samurais
Get the mullah, stay savage and suave
Now is that swavage? Well certainly
Still I keep it global
Multiple skyscraper paper, unknown totals
Who we? Who that be? Dubee, ask your peoples

Yeah that's the truth, brah
Say I'm a natural, call me 7-11
Playboy, it's factual, I stay high as the heaven
I'm like the castle
On the chess boards slide front to backwards
Up and down, side to side, boy, we at this
Me, Dre and Dubee savages in the masses
They call my type of people roguish-ass bastards
I pull a babe in and tell her flip the matress
And get the cash quick
Now player listen, this ain't no test of your broadcast system
Them niggas PSD and them be comin' with 'em
It ain't no puzzle how I feel about my scrillas
Gotta feed my chil'ens


At the building, chilling, living anxious
Waitin' for this bitch to deliver some funyuns
The same routine every day
Get dipped then I split in the Chevrolet
The four 15's shake the mirror
When the EB's quake couldn't sound no clearer
Feelin' so cool in my old school
Ain't trippin' off a bitch, I need some mo' loot
Oh, you ain't know you better check my file
I get stupid doo-doo dumb, don't sweat the style
Me and my niggas represent the real
Don't think we kill? Bet a 100 dollar bill
I'ma leave a body, no leads or clues

And get sick wit it, they can't get wit it
They need to eat my ass, and suck some dick wit it...

Maybe 'til there is no stizzar

You won't get kisses, you'll just get dick bitch
Its MD on the mic ho
And never say never cause you might blow
For some of you hoes it might take some time
But when I spit that rhyme and cold blow your mind
Fuck you for a while then take a nap

09 The Game Is Thick,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Verse 1:
Picture a girl in a courtroom holding a baby one week young
And her baby daddy in handcuffs about to get hung—
Its life up out in the pen if he don’t snitch on his crew
Now tell me in this situation, what would you do?
Would you stay true to the game and route you chose to take?
Or would you break, take a dive in the game and go out like a snake?
If you gotta think about it, boy this game ain't for you
Get out quick, retire- find something else to do
Boy Ima let it be known, this game ain't for everybody
You got too many Sammy the bulls and not enough John gottis
I don rubbed shoulders with niggas that’ll kill over canned goods
Get you in a cell, poke you, and take your manhood
I done had to put my knife in dumb niggas for testing me
And bust caps at the one time to prevent them from arresting me
Boy the game is thick- and it ain't no joke
When you starving like 10 niggas name Marvin- I mean broke
Chorus:
The game is thick, got lots of mackin involved
You got to get your grits and keep stacking them y’all
Shake them tricks with loose lips cause loose lips sink ships
——These niggas is a trip
The game is thick, got lots of mackin involved
You got to get your grits and keep stacking them y’all
Shake them tricks with loose lips cause loose lips sink ships
——These niggas is a trip
Verse 2:
The game is thick shit gets deep as hoe pussy
So im walking a tight rope and hope they don’t push me
Cause when I snap my strap sings songs of murda
Had to shake my bitch cause I’m scared I might hurt her
During times like this, I’m a cold piece of work
My chop drop niggas and leave em with wet t-shirts
It hurts- when my dough is getting low boy
I gotta get some mo’ boy- these niggas don’t know boy
Im hongry- white around the mouth like cookie
Plus I gotta buy some new clothes for janookie
Its a terrible thang- but its a terrible game
Gotta be down and diry cause only the terrible hang
Im one of them used to be broke niggas that owed niggas for ounce sacks
And went under spending chips on fits but then bounced back
Them urban guerrilla survaval tactics
Some of you blade ass niggas need to practice
Chorus:
The game is thick, got lots of mackin involved
You got to get your grits and keep stacking them y’all
Shake them tricks with loose lips cause loose lips sink ships
——These niggas is a trip
The game is thick, got lots of mackin involved
You got to get your grits and keep stacking them y’all
Shake them tricks with loose lips cause loose lips sink ships
——These niggas is a trip
Verse 3:
I was once told collect everything thats sold
If you fuck, get blowed, everything that glitter ain't gold
They told me all thats alive surely one day got to die
That was back in 85 but now them same rules apply- i-
Been there- done that- made a savage comeback
Mothafuckas shook me but now the all tryna run back
Though i hold no grudges- i forgive but not forget
That them bitches want money from me, but all they get is dick- trill
Its not about the greazin- boy its money season
And everything that happens damn sure happens for a reason
Each playa teach playa- thats how playas learn
Everybody can’t be king boy- you got to wait your turn
Not enough Indians- and way too many chiefs
Thats why we steady getting fucked in the ass with no grease- cease!
This ones for you- michael Robinson too
Mac Dre from the double R crew- I thought you knew!
Chorus:
The game is thick, got lots of mackin involved
You got to get your grits and keep stacking them y’all
Shake them tricks with loose lips cause loose lips sink ships
——These niggas is a trip
The game is thick, got lots of mackin involved
You got to get your grits and keep stacking them y’all
Shake them tricks with loose lips cause loose lips sink ships
——These niggas is a trip",https://genius.com/Mac-dre-09-the-game-is-thick-lyrics
The Pain,Al Boo Boo,2003.0,"I came to bring the pain
Pain nigga (uh)
This don't feel like pain to me (no pain, no gain)
No Pain (hit em' with the heaters)

Potna I'm vicious, you better check my statistics
Pimp the blood out of bitches, and boy I off a witness
Coughin' on the cat piss
 with some gats under the matress
Two fat double actions that chop like axes
Nigga I tear patches, bring the heat like matches
Pigs tryin' to snatch us but they can't catch us
Cause homie with chip, is too quick for Crown Vic
Plus I gotta give em' the slip cause I'm a ex-convict
One more strike I'm out, fuck what they talkin' bout
I'm hyphin' out, ain't no strikin' out
I'm a home run hitta, get a, bitch to do my dirt
Nigga the game bring pain, that's why I hurt

Feelin' the pain
Feelin' the pain
Feelin' the pain
(Once more)

I got some cuddies on Kemper, with some bad ass tempers
Just layin' dead to make a muthafucka wimper
In the winter rock some G-focs and peacoats, with the dope
Tryin' to push more flake than ski slopes
Pocket full of c-notes, tryin' to live life lav
But in this game sometimes you have to live like sav
It's a bumpy road, so I'm always in a grumpy mode
Drunk at the club, hella buzzed, nigga bumping hoes
Who knows I might bump a Bonnie like Clyde got
Run up with somethin' in the bitch, nigga, why not
I'm hot, disgusted, tired of being busted
I'm tellin' you somebody finna get hit with the musket


I'mma do what I gotta do to get it up out of you
Fuck robbin' one, fool a rob a crew
We call it eattin' when we catch a fool leakin'
Straight face take his shit, nigga no sneakin'
We can get a knot out a spot, hop coast
Murder, get further, to a spot that's not close
Get cheese like nachos, go bother some notch hoes
Always keepin' the hascos strapped like Roscoes
P. Coldtrain, we feed cocaine
To the dope fiends, who need dope mayne
Knock, knock who is it
My lil' nigga with the smidgets
Tryin' to stack some digits
Nigga can you dig it?",https://genius.com/Mac-dre-the-pain-lyrics

Ugh cutty this is the one
This is the one!
This isn't number two this is definitely THA one
Thizz is what it is!

Let me get a thizzle so I can get to smackin
And beat this track up like it's a nigga wit a snitch jacket
It's mackin in the throw back Starter
Mustard and mayo on tha yayo white nada
Eric Estrada on the bike tryna tackle me
Hit a quick right then I dip into Applebee's
I'm a thug partna
Beat the blood out ya
Nah I'm just playin' can a nigga get a dub out ya?
I'mma club hoppa catch me in the parkin' lot
Somethin new milleni or tha old school barkin' hot
I start and stop, stop and start
Push the dart, squash the lark
My name is Mac Dre and I don't give a fuck
If you really want me, baby give it up, give it up
Give a fuck, I'm a drunk and an alchy
I don't need life insurance cause she sucked the life out me

We S-T-U-P-I-D
When we go to the club we don't need I.D
Everywhere we go it's a party y'all
We gon' get it crackin' like the Mardi Gras

Man even back when I was a 20 sack buya
I was el flamo, partna I had fire
Bumpin' like a bad choir
Hutches used to admire
Tha way I rocked tha mic on that Bombay Sapphire
Down like a flat tire
Heated like a flat iron
Had a Benz and a Lexus, but not a Jaguar
Cutty I slap fire
When they talk back
Oh this watch and the chain
The hutch bought that
Mac Dre fought back
For position
In this rap game I was really on a mission
From Reno to Richmond
My teams known for pinchin'
De-Con the poison
And Kilo the henchman
We known for the tension
We tear the club up
Giggin' so hard boy we tear the rug up

First Time I Seen Her,Turf Buccaneers,2001.0,"(Mac Dre)
I was with my nigga Sporty, we was comin' outta Yam Yams
Seen a bad bitch in a six and was like God Damn
Love me long time, yellow skin chopsticks
A notch bitch who looked like she can chop dick
I said stop quick, lil' mama pull over
Oh man if I knock this bitch, oh boy it's over
She said, I'm sorry I ain't tryin' to be rude
But I'm a lesbian and I don't fuck with no dudes
I ain't mad at ya I'm tryin' to join the party
Fo' real I'm a dyke trapped in a man's body
She bit quick, hook, line and sinker
And I was all in her mentals the first time I seen her
(Dubee)
Let me get off in your mind, intertwine with yo' thoughts
I rearrange thangs, strange lessons I was taught
I mean, I shufflin', hustlin', doing my thang thizzle
I ran up on a bizzle, bossed up and checked the dizzle
She was a Mazda ho, responsible
With tactics, like them hat tricks
Makin niggas do back flips
And so being the nigga that I be, fo sheez
I had to peak and see, Oh boy what she can do for me
I reckon I bring chit-chat
And get me more than a thin crack in a nut shell
No tuck tail Ya know that
I flow this shit like niagra, mouthpiece like a ???
Choppin' this pimpin' like it's karate
(PSD)
The first time I seen her
I was just hollerin at her all the things that I could think of
She's so fine, she a dime
She my kind, gotta make that mine

Help Me,Thizzelle Washington,2002.0,"Most of my brodies is ex cons and parolees
Drink heem and OD's
Roll twomps and goldies
Get made from Goldie, 'cause Goldie the made man
Don't fuck with blade men
Go hard like cavemaen
Ay man, I don't think you understand though
I stalk the streets, with a Colt Commando
A Thug and a vandal, a walkin' scandal
Drink like ten fishes, smoke like candles
Pistol grip handle on the riot 12 gauge
Keep the rollers off me and out the jail cage
Got a twelve page letter from my folks in the rally's
He got caught up in a riot and they shipped him outta Cali
Omaha, Texas, Leavenworth, Kansas
They got us spread out, I don't know where my mans is
But it's like this, I don't complain
'Cause I knew about the game when I hopped in the thang

Lord, can you hear me?
Too many niggas dying
Living Cutthoat but they trying
Lord, you gots to help me
I know sometimes they wrong
Keep my niggas strong

Listen, I been walking the line
Piercing the wire, stepping with my chin up
Woke or sleep, my lids never shut
Protected but rapists stay PC'd up
Escorted by badges and handcuffs
Billy clubs and face shields to storm your cell
Search your locker, thirty days in lock up
From reminiscing with my celly, pretending
We daydreaming of flying, we high
Eternal freedom, but we paid the price for living this life
We cry inside, but only cold stares for the naked eye
A young boy with mafia ties, so while inside
The bricks and fences, got every tear stitched up
With coke and black pinheads twisted in zigzags
Watching time pass, 'cause I ain't got nothing but time
Writing invisible lines on lined paper
But being secluded made my rhymes greater
So I stick to my music, song after song
I might make a hit over the phone
Hello?

Lord, can you hear me?
Too many niggas dying
Living Cutthoat but they trying
Lord, you gots to help me
I know sometimes they wrong
Keep my niggas strong

'92, '93, hit a lick, split a key
Flossin' on chips and spit a clip, the game was fun to me
It didn't take me long to see it wouldn't last though
How else can my cash grow?
Without the J team and task force coming to ask for me
I'm moving too fast, homie
I wish you would've got over the gate and I escaped with the cash, homie
But I'll bust my gun to avoid the pen
We was young lights when you went it
But changed from boys to men, be home at 10
Do that, and come home, that ain't no place for a player
Can't make no money, ain't no bitches in there, but life ain't fair
But your world don't stop, you gotta keep keep on
We pueblo no matter what street we on, the streets we roam
That's why I ain't wrote you when in here
But I'll see you when I see you
If not, then when they lock the rider in
Then tough love, one thug
Issue a slug to that snitch nigga
Finish where we left off, I'mma get rich nigga

Lord, can you hear me?
Too many niggas dying
Living Cutthoat but they trying
Lord, you gots to help me
I know sometimes they wrong
Keep my niggas strong",https://genius.com/Mac-dre-help-me-lyrics
So Hard,It’s Not What You Say...It’s How You Say It,2001.0,"Times are getting so hard

I love the shine so all the time I grind and rhyme and flow hard

Now I'm riding show cars
Ho's jock when I ride the block, hop in mine and out of your car

Make a beezy blow hard
Just like my neezy Tomar
Take this pimpin' so far
Might catch me down in your car
I don't fuck with no marks
Baby sell them ho parts
Feel it when I spill it girl, let me get to your heart
You say you don't want no part
Because you done heard I blow cars
Don't listen to them bomarks
They just some hating ho sharks
I'm so scarred and came so far
Sometimes when it's sunny, girl, it rains so hard
Oh lord, don't let me kill no mo
Don't make me have to steal for a mill no mo

When you let that bitch go
I'mma make that bitch ho
And we gon' get that big dough
From Queens and Sacramento
I rap to instrumentals
While macking baby mental's
Pack a chrome 40 with a red dot on me
Weapon and utensils
My game is sweet as mentos
I'm riding baby's dentals
I've been running game on broads since fools was sliding pencils
Staying on my ten toes
Stomping like some insoles
They copy me like Kinko's
When they see me in my clean clothes
Perpetrating, duplicating, imitating, pimpatrating
All ways hating, can't relate, now you're hater congregating
Won't hate a domination, but man it's combination
Of this gangster and this pimp, man he gon' rock the nation

How I Got This Name,Young Black Brotha Entertainment presents Constant Drama,1998.0,"(Mac Dre, boy)

Since I was a young buck my mackin was cool
I used to tongue-kiss girls in the back of the school
And maybe sometime a nigga got mo' than a kiss
I put my finger in some puss that smelled like ???
And as I reminisce, huh, it's kinda funny
How I talked little girls out they lunch money
They didn't run from me, they used to jock young Dre
Then I stepped up game and got some cock one day
It was a bloody mess and yes, tight as some vice grips
But I was a little nigga killin some tight shit
Tossed, turned and started fuckin her few friends
Cause she told two friends and they told two friends
And word got out that young Dre could fuck good
Then I bumped a bitch who could fuck and suck good
And after that, cock was nothin to me
So I flipped the script and stopped fuckin' for free
Every bitch I dicked down, had to kick down
Whoever I tossed up, had to cough up
Young in the game, mayne, but quick to learn
That money makes this world turn
So I peep game, pop that thang
And let fools know how I got that name
Mac Dre, boy
(Mac Dre, boy)

I used to creep on Crest streets with a tight mask on
Posted, toasted, getting my cash on
Strapped with a gat and a bottle of Hen-do
Orange zig zags and big bags of that Endo
I pushed pebbles to the midnight hour
24-7 same clothes, no shower
Dopesacks smellin like nutsacks, but fuck it
I was checkin ducats, collectin' buckets
But now I'm fresh out the pen with a chip on my shoulder
And out of the motor my blood runs much colder
Somebody told a fed I was in the mix
Hittin licks, nigga, ain't that a bitch
I make raps, stay far from saps
Checks my traps and collect my snaps
The Country Club Crest is where I got this game
And rappin on the mic is how I got that name",https://genius.com/Mac-dre-how-i-got-this-name-lyrics

Now I'mma crack my heem, twist my blunt
But you know MD and Sugawolf ain't know punk

Crestside pound, with style, and I'm the ruler
Riggity-rough and tough, strap 4-5's and stuff
In that niggity-North Pole is where you're finding us
Do it matter? Nope, we international
And boat super spokes while we smashing ho's
From deep in the east or even New York
I bet I got that Cali indo to smoke
Creeping tailored, talking more shit than a sailor
Twisting Backwood blunts can't fuck with Vega's
Now the ho's say a Nigga ain't shit, but I'm raw
Sharpshoot a saw, and put the grip in they jaw
Now what you thought? We chasing up some
Check a trump put that dump with my dump gun
Come from the Country Club Creeznest
Killer affiliated so I  by request
A nigga show my tactics
And eat up with a little  in this here rap shit

Well here's a little something about a nigga like me
Young silky, R-O-M-P
Super fly lavish, Creesy savage
Love Kool-aid, neck bones and cabbage
Be in the cut, smoking the chronic
Nigga couldn't see me with a high bionic
Drink Micky not Miller, cold cot dealer
Got more ho's then they got in Chachilla
Super bad peela, got's to have skrilla
Bitch treat a nigga like I'm a mad killa
No man lying incarceration
Read to the general population
Silky, slim like Penny, smooth like Remy
But y'all don't hear me
Pockets so fat that I walk with a limp
And I'm doing big things with that Sugawolf Pimp

So trick don't get it twisted, I spit that potent pimp shit
Fuck with an OG pro up on the floor and get your bitch lipped
Party like I'm faded, 'cause I be captivating
Player haters who hate these players who fly without a cape
Now when a soldier skip to the rescue

 I whip then dip 'cause nigga that's what the cess do
So improve your macking skills, fuck Jack and Jill
I'm all about my skrill deal, so these real niggas feel me
OG game pumping up through my blood
So twist a twap sack and burn it down to the nub
We roll on Vogues and thang, it will be  to them 15's
Keep heat in your seat, clip in your shit, make sure your shit clean
Show no fear, call about this here
90's game so I maintain, steady Bogarding like a beer
And I swear on purple hair dosha dank that got me buzzing
Folks  so I know there ain't no love
In this environment, it's just retirement
When folks fuck with that heat and get burnt by the fire, bitch

We putting that Country Club Crestside for shows
Love to choke, 420 smoke
That's dank, you ain't knowing? Ride Regals
My compadre cuddie, my amigo
I'm 24 Karat Bay Area road
And 707 is the area code
Popping like Jiffy, butter like Skippy
Old school like Rodney Allen Ripley
Hit me with your wide receiver
Million dollar man like that fool 
Never had a dog that didn't get down
Never had a broad that didn't kick down
Dick down, top notch 
Double down heels when I tap that ass
Making my cash, selling my game
I don't think they know mayne, tell 'em how we swang

We bout our money, get our paper

Watch me glide on twenties, get money
Smokin' backwoods on pills, breakin' bitches at will

On professional women limpin' up and down the block
I'm slangin' rocks, I'm slangin' cock
Pimp or die, nigga, I'm so fly, a square is what I'm not
I'm Lil Bruce, baby, I come from the V
The home of Ike Turner, Rose Budd, and MD

You think I'm carin' about sharin' on snatch
And I'm runnin' scams to get my hands on scratch
Understand that
Woman romance without finance to me
Stands no chance with no man of my pedigree
Call my hoggish if you would
Shoulda been a part of Sick Wid It Records
Wit a pig on my necklace
Would you dig my possessions since the air is my gift
Or should it matter if it's turf shit burnt for chips
Nigga, we hurt shit, that way since birth with it
As for this gift to gab shit, mayne, we cursed with it
As far as dirt, we did it
So, nigga, name it, I done it
And love to hit it while she on her stomach
Money and hundreds

Watch us rip shit, the gangster or the pimp shit
No simp shit, bitch, my mug stay mean
Out the ricks wit' kicks and gun machines
You know the green, the thing we was dying to get
Is the reason why my niggas came so damn sick
And when I represent, bitch, I put it on dubs
Park it by the club and let the rat heads rub
I'm out to get the cheddar
If she fight, nigga, let her
It don't matter, I stay fatter

It don't matter, long as my pockets get fatter
I don't give a fuck if civilians got scatter
I'm the last batter, better hit a home run
When I stick my dick in I watch how fast she cum
Up the block sideways when I shift I chirp quick
And after that first dick, I'm all in your purse, bitch

Goin' off Hennesizay and a half a thizzle

What’s Really Going On?,What’s Really Going On?,UnKnown,"*phone ringing*
Hello, you have reached Mac Dre’s Romp Rap Line
To hear the story of Jack, Jill, and Little Jack, press 1
And for my personal favorite, Lil Bo Peep and his six freaks, press 2
Go on and make your selection now

I know this man named Jack who has a wife named Jill
Jill works two jobs to help Jack pay bills
They try so hard to make ends meet
But barely make enough for Jack and Jill to eat
And little Jack Jr., they was to check with consumer
‘Cause at the end of the month, he always eating on tuna
What’s R-E-A-double L-Y going on?
I gotta ask you before I keep flowing on

What’s really going on?

Jack drank heavily, sober he never be
A chronic alcoholic since 1970
And Jill was a big flirt, brothers would get hurt
And Jack wouldn’t know a thing ‘cause he was there with her
And Jack was the soft, and Jill be the boss type
Sprung on Jill because she knew how to talk right
But one day Jill slipped, got caught in the bed with
The guy from next door, Joe, yeah, she was straight sick with
The things she did since she was a kid, she snapped in head
And had a kid but never got rid of that freakiness
Are you peepin’ this?
Well, let me ask you a question before I deepen this

What’s really going on?

Little Jack Junior grew up to be fly
A shake ‘em, break ‘em, take ‘em player kind of a guy
When others would grind, Jack Junior would rhyme
I guess to this fact, the rollers were blind
He had dreams of rappin’, gold and platinum
But rollers would jack him, and steady attack him
One day they beat him down, hit him all in his crown
He swung and hit one, they sent him to the ground
Cuffed and stuffed him, continued to rough him
In jail they stuffed him, when Jack did nothing
Charged him with assault on a C-O-P
Tryna stop him from getting to the T-O-P
Had a max of 4, pleaded and got 2
Now he’s in jail on a deal he copped to
Thinkin’ ‘bout the day when he gets home
Huh, what’s really going on?

What’s really going on?

Jack, Jill, and Little Jack, man, can you get with that?
Well, as I spit this rap, people, don’t miss a fact
That these are problems that many must go through
Jill found sex was hard to say no to
Jack got married to a no-good wife
And the rollers messed with Little Jack all his life
What’s R-E-A-double L-Y going on?
Khayree, let the beat keep flowing on…

What’s really going on?


Yeah, though—Mac muthafuckin’ Dre in the house
With my homeboy Kilo Curt—what’s up, Kilo?
What’s up, playa?
Ah man, I’m just kickin’ it like a ninja
Hangin’ in tight like a booty bite, everything alright
That’s right
Yeah, we done served ‘em some of that commercial shit
Now it’s time to come with some of that game
Straight game
Yeah, flip this muthafucka over to the other side
And let’s go to the Crestside
Straight Crestside
So I could start spittin’ to y’all fools
Yeah, straight comin’ up in ‘92
That’s right

Romped Out
Straight dealin’ it

A queen lookin like she need to be in a magazine
Or a movie scene, movin the green
Working for a team thats working for a king
40s and 19, lean, bustin out the seams
Of tight jeans, no one night flings
I need something thats gon' bring things that bling bling to a king
Green, what do you mean?
A hutch thats breezy like afro-sheen
Get down wit another broad, if thats yo' thing
Its a natural thing, and Im smooth as cream
And I know, you can, sell a fool a dream
Top notch-er, betta watch her

Got to make a knot every time I work
When the stack gets back kick back and purp
I cold in it, hope you soak in it
What side you ride with, broke or rich?

Ass with the most cash, lives higher
It ain't a problem that I can't fix
I keep it popin and makes more chips
Make more hits and get the crew HYPHY

Shirt says champ but is she really a winner?
Or really a beginner tryn to enter
If she coo then foo ima send her
Its all about the cash put the trash in the can
If you dont understand girl im the man
Stick to my plan, we can live life lav
24/7 I get my cash
Stash dash shake the task
If a punk start funk dont wait to blast

I go for the green and the gusto
Dont trust no body like maudy (snitch)

Pimp who wear a, new pair of Gucci's, I'm doogie
Spit like loogie, strapped with 
Yes, yes, best dressed, throwback like fresh, fresh
Been in everything from G5 to SS
Bad news, girls, guns and booze
Run with fools, ho's choose, come with tools

Yoke the new school in a

Wild child, my momma made me move out
Too loud, this a new route, follow me now

She cold on the pole, ew she hit it

Said I'm like an uzi with it, when I spit it
She can't help it she got to get doogie wit it
Get doogie wit it

I'm trying to stay number one without stepping in number two
I'mma leave the house man my weapon is coming too
I'm real Cali, catch me in Mill Valley
In a  on some ill Rallys
I smell rich, look rich, look bitch
You heard the hook, a nigga trying to juk, bitch
No chump change here, keep  near
Ride Benz' and Beamers, no Mustangs here
We roll Euro, I'm so thorough
Squat to the Marriott with your girlo
Man I'm drunk I've had to many martinis
Took a wrong turn and now I'm in the boonies
But all my whips is navigated, my screens is animated
Everything is automated, them niggas got to hate it
Pablo made it, Mr. Full Blood
It made me doog up and tear the booth up

And you wouldn't believe the weed I've been copping
Straight grade, call me the grape ape
That ain't a Backwood man, wait, wait
I drive with no license, see 
Want it, buy it, no matter what the price is
Nigga with dreads from the city on the edge
Smoke nigga like Benson and Hedges
Give me a Remy with a lemon wedge
I'm trying to get my nuts sucked like Lemon Heads
I got the feeling with the biggest stunta's in the building
""Thizz what that is?"" Uh, I'm just chilling
I look in the mirror, it tell me I'm cool
What you expected? Resect it, Bay Area fool
Shut up, light the blunt and let doobie hit it
Turn up the beat and let's get doogie wit it

Freaky Shit,Stupid Doo Doo Dumb,1998.0,"It don’t matter how you do it, when you do it, who you do it wit’
Long as it’s that freaky shit

Never question profession since I was an adolescent
To females, here’s a suggestion when it comes to the dick
I make draft picks, the ones who cum too quick
And the ones that hang with it
Watchin’ hoes hate ‘cause can’t handle this
Rollin’ on a hot night and lookin’ jiggy
Checkin’ my pockets, nothin’ less than a fifty; niggas feel me
Step in the club, niggas and broads wall-to-wall
Step to the bar to get my swerve on, Henny with a straw
What I’m in the mood for when it comes to my nut, I’m hardcore
Send the Mo to the table by the dancefloor
Walk through the crowd, gettin’ jocked with my crew
Somebody’s popped the Mo ‘cause somebody’s gettin’ screwed
Let me get my stroll on, so I can see who’s bold
Because this pussy I got here, yeah, it’s platinum gold
And my lips on swole as you explode
Beggin’ for the ass once more and now you know the shit’s no joke
Give me five hund’ because baby I need some smoke
Pussy-whipped, so fake niggas, they can’t cope


69 ways turn into a 1-38
From the dining room table, I’m watchin’ you masturbate
Turn that ass over and assume the position
Either it’s a stickin’ or a hellafied freaky lickin’
Oh, you ain’t knowin’ ‘bout this mackin’ ass P
I be that Infamous sista from the S-A-C, bitch
Blaze my muthafuckin’ blunt in a set
And all you playa hatin’ hoes, you can give Mac Dre head
All you hatin’ ass niggas, keep your eyes on your bitch
One time is all it takes and she’ll be lickin’ on my clit, ha ha


You got yours first but don’t trip
Don’t stop, let’s continue
Play with my nuts while I’m diggin’ in deep up in you
You ain’t no punk, ugh, girl, you’s a freak
On your stomach while I’m divin’, you squeezin’ booty cheeks
Now switch ‘em up, hit ‘em up in the air and open wide
Let me slide and glide before you ride
This a trip, damn, baby, you hella sick
Put her mouth to the pussy to the booty back to the mouth slurpin’ hella dick
You hella wet, ugh, and gettin’ moister
You on gin, ginseng, hop, and smoked oysters
Stupid doo doo, you got voodoo, bitch, I think you cursed
The way you stripped and pulled that big dildo out your purse
Joogin’ and jabbin’, stabbin’, havin’ a ball
Jackin’ off, soundin’ hella soft
You got a husband? You married and doin’ sneaky shit?
But don’t trip, beyatch, this that freaky shit",https://genius.com/Mac-dre-freaky-shit-lyrics
Take Yo’ Panties Off,It’s Not What You Say...It’s How You Say It,2001.0,"I wanna know if you wanna get it on
Baby let me take yo' panties off
And if you feelin' mile high
And you wanna take a ride
Baby let me take yo' panties off

Hip hop, the hibbit to the hibbit
Add Mac Dre and a lil' wiggy wiggy
Can you dig it? Or is it too explicit?
When I knock at the door she don't ask, who is it?
I'm bringin' Bridget, Rolanda and them
Tryin' to get a workout like I'm in the gym
Keep cumin' again, again and again
I done spent too many years in the pen
I'm livin' again doin' what I wanna
When I'm feelin' Keith Sweat-ish, and I want her
I'm in the sauna like a family boss
Quit trippin' take them panties off

I wanna know if you wanna get it on
Baby let me take yo' panties off
And if you feelin' mile high
And you wanna take a ride
Baby let me take yo' panties off

It's a Friday night and I'm feelin' horny
Hopped out the whip with two chicks on me
All eyes on me, when I stepped on in
I saw all eyes then when I stepped on in
What's up girlfriend how bout you and friends
Meet me at the VIP in about five minutes
Freaky shit, yeah I'm with it
I gets live when I got drugs in me
Feel me, I'm like that 6-man touch
Feel me, all females get touched
Exhibit, I make women's thongs come off
I get a hard on from seein' all skin no cloth

You drunk then smoked hella blunts tonight
Cut the crap now, I ain't with this square shit
I told you way back I'm a playa, biatch
You want a man but I'm not the one though
I just wanna hit that yockamundo
Oh what you thought, this a dumb date?
Pump fake, I ain't bitin' on that bunk bait
Quit the horseplay and the monkey business
Let me call Rich so we can pop some thizz's
Lets go handle some grown folk business
Ain't nothing wrong with getting it on for a minute
Lets go home for a minute, do the woopty wop
Let a cutthroat show ya what he do to ya
I'mma say it real slow so you can hear
Get bucket naked, lose the gear

Mac Who,The Best of Mac Dre Volume Four,2004,"Ha, straight from Vallejo
But now I’m back with young Khayree
And my cuddies in YBB
And I’m serving straight game, yeah, you know
So you can go ask that Chinese hoe
‘Cause she, took a couple lines from the nigga
Young Mac Mall in a straight rhyme, Mac Who, bitch

The beat stopped, but we won’t stop
And hoes like you are straight on jock
It’s young Mac Dre in the place
Punk bitch, get out my face
If you ain’t got green, bounce from the scene
You hear what I mean?
Cuddie, it’s out from the play—coming like this

My lyrical content is deep like a good book
I serve flavor just like a good cook
Grab a mic, get ill at a party
Rap so good, I send chills through your body
Rhyme style tight like coochie
Raw like sushi, and funky like Bootsy
And top notch is what they rate Dre
‘Cause I got more rhymes than food at Safeway
So make way, for the M-A-C
As I put Crestside on the M-A-P
I got more game than that fool Pat Sajak
I’m a G, a player from way back
Skills superior, far from inferior
Got the pimp shell with the gangster interior
And with the broads, I’m smooth and suave, son
And when it’s funk, I get the job done
So don’t underestimate the great Mac
‘Cause I make raps and pimp to make snaps
I hate saps, can’t stand a smerk
Definition of smerk—sucker, mark, and a jerk
I perks, off Courvoisier
Slightly heated with the Grand Marnier
Never hesitate to put game in a tight rap
I’m serving muthafuckas…‘cause I’m like that

MAC WHO? MAC WHO?
Check it out—MAC WHO?
Ay, break it down for me—MAC WHO?
MAC WHO? MAC WHO? MAC WHO?
(Spit that shit, cuddie)

Young nigga, me, I live the life on constantly
Them suckers figure that they can take me off the charts
And try to get wit’cha
But all them jealous gettin’ mobbed off the picture
I’m smoking roper while that real shit hit ya
So where them Crestside creepers?
And if you serve me bammer, boy, you best’a call a preacher
‘Cause I’mma come see ya wit’ a vengeance
Nationwide poppin’, Crestside pimp shit
Superfly, smoking quarters a day
But not off candy annie, this that Humboldt dank
With my Strictly SES crew and we all got half
So I’m lighting up the roper, hit the strip and I blast
Ain’t worried about a sucker fucking over my high
‘Cause I’m rollin’ with some killers in the game, go or die
Fit the track on our deck in remote control
And dawg, I really ain’t worried about no punk ass hoes

(“Break the bitches filthy…”) MAC WHO?
(“Break the bitches filthy…”) MAC YOU!
(“Break the bitches filthy…”) MAC WHO?
(“Break, break the bitches filthy…”) Bitch, I thought you knew
MAC YOU! (“…I’m always getting over”)

I used to slang yayo on the streets of the Three C’s
But now I slang game on cassettes and CDs
I rips and flips caps with stacks of raw rap
Attack some saps who steady flaps and jaw jacks
I’m all that, and I got Mac Mall’s back
Fumbled in ’92 but now I got the ball back
And fully representing this Northern Cali, hoe
I’m from the Crest, northside of Valley Joe
From the O, down to San Jo, up to Sacto, up to Frisco
Everybody knows Mac Dre’s a factor
Taking this rap thang to the next chapter
I rap to, funky beats that rock ya
Made by Khayree, brother of the Rocker
I sock ya, with these blows of game
That’s potent than a joint of that doja, mayne
I know this thang and can explain it well
So what you need, boy, I got game for sale

MAC WHO? (Hoes love it ‘cause I got much of it)
MAC YOU! MAC WHO?
(“Break the bitches filthy…”) MAC YOU!
(Mac muthafuckin’ Dre, bitch)
(“Break the bitches filthy…”)
Young Mackin’ ass Mall
My name is young Mac Mall, mayne, and this is My Opinion
You need to get with me and young MD because we pimpin’
BIATCH!
I’m a monster—what you say, Dre? I’m a beast
(Muthafuckin’ beast
Them hoes don’t know this—check this out, Mall
Check this out…)

She wants to get married but I ain’t and I cain’t
‘Cause I’m sprung on my muthafuckin’ dank and some drank
I got a fat bank, and still break hoes
And if your bitch gets to jockin’, I will break yours
The Mac named Dre from the C-R-E-S-T
Ask about a nigga and they all will say “Yes, he’s the shizit”
I gizet, much pussy on my dizick
Never would I lizick or pay like a trizick
I’m like that, potna, I thought you heard
Fuckin’ with your brain like some Thunderbird
I’m doper than a joint of that potent dank
And funky like the county jail holding tank
Romper Room crew for life
Down with Spice and my homeboy Shiest
My niggas from the bammer… (Like that...)",https://genius.com/Mac-dre-mac-who-lyrics
Global,Rapper Gone Bad,1999.0,"I been tryin to flip the script and take this rap thing to the next page
But the federalies got me travellin on _Con Air_ like I'm Nicholas Cage
Did 4 years, 4 months in the feds, but couldn't get no peace
Released from the belly of the beast, but the 'ralies put a nigga on a leash
The rules and regulations they inflicted, had me restricted, paroled
Kept me from blowin bomb, knowin I'm hooked and addicted for sho'
And how am I to be an MC when I can't get my travel on?
Can't bring no babby home, 'cause every morning I'm gettin sweated by Babylon
The only way out is to max out and give these fools back they lease
Fuck parole, probation, piss test and supervised release
I'mma bring a calendar, bounce, blow up like Chernobyl
Kirk out and get mobile and do this thing global
Worldwide rompin', stompin' in other nations
Blowin' bomb with Jamaicans, and sippin' Dom with them Haitians
Kickin' major flows, have Asian hoes, playin' the Romp like it's for eternity
Kick gravel, travel, see what they know about me in Werbach, Germany

We be global
Touch land in that sand over the seas
Blew off a couple of G's, releasin' verbal telekinese, for sheez
Clickalate with players, under the stairs, to the Himalayas
Kinda thick, layer for layer

Sometimes I sit and reminisce about life in '87
When I was doin' my thug thang, brain ten miles higher than heaven
One-track minded, blinded by the game and quick change
Not knowin across the way-way niggas were doin' big thangs
And it's a shame
Cause before I hit the F-E-D's
I didn't know about them niggas in Cuba and them sisters in Belize
Now I'm curious: Is Belizan pussy the bomb?
When they blow, do they hum, and how quick do they come?
Boy, it's time to hit the friendly skies and fly like a seagull
Post up in spots where the pot's good and legal
Eat tacos in Mexico with cats named Flaco
And catch a red-eye flight the same night to Morocco
Top-nacho, chasin' superbad scrilla fiends
Then bounce to the Phillipines and get mo' head than guillotines
Boy, life ain't nothin but fat checks and head sex
So I'mma get mobile, stay global like FedEx


I was a cell dweller, eatin' Top Ramen and sardines
Now it's Taiwanese Japanese cuisine
Barefooted, fitted, sippin' on sake
Blow on big hashish while I feast on teriyaki
International is how I'm smashin', hoe
A cutthroat nigga that will blast and roll
I took a trip to Queens to see Jazz and Preme
They had a nigga blowin' brown, said it wasn't no green
But that ain't no thang, cause in Tacoma
I blew bomb 'til I was in a coma
And in Seattle my partner Chilly Chill
Got that purple leaf dank that really real
I'm global, boy, I be travellin'
Gettin' further in the air like a javelin
Chirpitch, kirkitch, finna bounce to St. Croix

Hustle,The Best of Mac Dre Volume Four,2004.0,"I’m ‘bout to get it right, bubblin’ all night
Hustlin’, man, that’s most of my life
Fuck Tuesdays and Thursdays, I’m out on the streets
Stoppin’ traffic, not worried about police
And they punk sweeps, see, I got fronted the zip
By my older cousin, and when he gave it he said this:
'Shit, go carefully, be wit’ it, slick
You don’t want a case to fight.' 'A’ight, I get it.'
To the track for scritch, now ain’t this a bitch
I damn near made it happen, but somebody was jealous
And told I was crackin’, but fuck it see
They gotta live for workin’ with police
Laughin’ at authorities, to hell with the station
Plus, a shell to whoever gave Vallejo information
Patient, who stay with his head achin’
Up all night tryna right my bacon, hustle

And while my nigga Boss on the S-T straight hustlin'
I’m networkin’, still at your B and I’m bustin’
And who I’m trustin’? Not nann nigga
Hustlin’ in a different form tryna get it bigger
Mouthpiece so hard on a broad, no labor
Hustlin’, never playin’ Captain Save-a-
Hoe, you should know B-Luv ain't playin'
Like a poodle, she obeyin' everything that I’m sayin'
Enough of that, though; a million things goin’ through my mind
But I handle it like a soldier gettin’ blapped at on the frontline
Takin’ all bullets, even shells
My life’s a big hustle and I’mma show and tell
Never been materialistic, everything’s for sale
Beatin’ ‘em to the punch like Bill Gates for the mail
Just like a crack fiend need blow, got to have it
That’s how I be, green in my face, got to grab it

Me and my amigos, we seein’ chips
Come through dipped in European whips
Beats slappin', we so mackish
Giggin’ in somethin’ so throwbackish
No practice, it’s all on auto
Old school dope game like Troops and Lottos
Don’t use the bottle but boy I’m dope
Just like a 30, eye through the scope
My niggas move more snow than ski slopes
Y’all niggas is lame, don’t know the ropes
I don’t know your folks, fuck ‘em, they weenies
My niggas jack saps, put holes in beanies
Get it, get it, get it, eat it and shit it
Every time I done it, they say he did it
Mac Dre, keep a heater on me
And touch more bread than salami

It’s the muthafuckin’ Husalah Husalah
How could you make a song about hustlin'
Without the Husalah, man, it’s nothin'
You're petty coat pushin’, I’m 26 kickin’ it
Cross country sippin’ it
Pay me 25, I only pay one-sixth of it
Dumb dewy fresh, yeah
Trill shit, I’m livin’ it, Mob ‘til my death
1, 2, 3, get your scrill right, nigga
On the darkside of life, you’ll find me, a dope dealer
Husalah Husalah, a sideways leaner
If I twist six off, I’mma bring back nina
My 4-5 spark, your lights’ll go dark
And I still got work for cheap
My hustle won’t slack off until I get my smack off
Pull my stog out on a poor bitch and jack off
I don’t need sex, I need Tecs and 4-5’s
A muthafuckin’ Husalah Husalah like WHA!",https://genius.com/Mac-dre-hustle-lyrics

Niggas wanna get blood
We all wanna get rich and have phat cars and clothes
Bitches wanna get licks
Niggas wanna get blood
We all wanna get rich and have phat cars and clothes

I play, laugh and smile but I know life ain't no joke
You could be filthy rich one day and the next morning wake up broke
I'm glad I learned my lesson, way back in '87
I was wide around the mouth, buying burritos at 7Eleven
Boy I used to think it was all about jewelry, cars and fits
'Til an OG told me, ""young nigga get yo' grits""
Now I get grits in sums that are lump
Heart like Roy Jones, mind like Donald Trump
Cash, R-U-L-E-S everything around me, it's obvious
So hustle I must D-O if he O
He gonna pay a nigga like Reno 'cause he know
You don't play with me or my skrill
Boy I'm hella cool but don't make me kill
Just soak up this pimping tip
And listen to me when I say get yo' grits

Quick getting spitting, mittens handling Hamiltions
U, G chasing, replace them H-O-E's who make no cheese
No time to be wasting my conversation making G's
Savage about it, not without it, let me hear you shout it
My cabbage sprouted, jackers scouted, boy I don't doubt it
Niggas is hungry homie, lonely without their grits
Bitches be phony homie for chips, ain't that a bitch
But I don't break and I won't fake, gotta keep it real
And they gon' hate, 'cause I'm gon' make a motherfucking meal

Bitches wanna get licks
Niggas wanna get blood
We all wanna get rich and have phat cars and clothes
Bitches wanna get licks
Niggas wanna get blood
We all wanna get rich and have phat cars and clothes

Money makes this world spin
Not your man or girlfriend
I keep my mind on that dollar, turning down nothing but my collar
Gotta take care of me and my seed
Buy what I want not what I need
A nigga want something substantial made
Don't want no damn financial aid
Getting them checks from the G-O-V
You better H-U-S-T-L-E
'Cause day in, day out, big skrill's what it's all about
Boy I love my bank roll
Don't feel cool if it ain't swole
Gotta get cabbage gotta get chips
Gotta be a savage and get my grits
Ready for funk nigga, who want drama?
Collecting mail just like 2Pac's mama
Crestsider, Romp rider, might of robbed your bitch
Gotta get my cabbage biscuits gravy and grits

Mac Dre’s The Name (1989 - EP),Young Black Brotha (EP),UnKnown,"Yeah let me put this shit out
So I can make this muthafuckin' tape
Mac Dre, Mac Dre in full effect to my Crestside peoples
And it goes a little something like this

Dre, the lyrical kingpin
I'm dealing rhymes that got you fiendin'
'Cause every time you hear the name
The rhymes have you kicking like base cocaine
Erotic, exotic, they call me narcotic
'Cause fans get hooked on my funky fresh product
The captain of rappin' and I'm just the Mac and...
??? with ??? and my dollars are stackin'
Steady coming up 'cause I'm getting elevation
Numero uno that means I'm the ace and...
The best who ever did it, I just spit it
A sucker heard me rhyme and he damn near shitted
That's the way it goes with a big ol' mack
Hanging with the boys on the ??? street track
Drinking Hennessy then kick it with a girl
I beat the babbies down and then I hurl
And every time i throw up, you know i roll up
A big fat spliff and then I'm to' up
The very next day i do it all again
But instead of Hennessy I'm sippin' on gin
Mac, Mac, Mac Dre is the name
Mac, Mac, Mac Dre is the name

You see once upon a time I was convicted
Started writing rhymes and i got addicted
Know every single time I put a pen in my hand
I write a dope rhyme now here I go, again
See I'm an M.C. and Mac Dre's my name
No i don't sport ?kinkles? and i don't wear chains
Fuck being jerked i got my fingers mounted
And the gold stands out while the money is counted
I kick with my posse and my posse is large
Clocking long dollars and the boys are hard
Being down and dirty 'cause it's so damn ruthless
Make the wrong move and you end up toothless
No I'm not joking 'cause i don't tell jokes
I kick with the boys while Ray Cat yokes
Burning long rubber all on your shoes
'Cause a posse like mine is just bad news
See I'm the kinda of brother who like his money
I call a girl bitch, won't call her honey
Just kick back while the money is made
Sippin' on Bird and grape cool-aid
I may talk a little dirty when I rap
But i rap pimp shit not this and that
I'm just a young brotha with so much game
Gettin' busy on the mic and Mac Dre is the name
Mac, Mac, Mac Dre is the name
Mac, Mac, Mac Dre is the name

Mac Dre is the name fool, so be cool
And if you want to get taught, then come to my school
And you better pay attention if you don't I'll flunk ya
Do like Michael Jordan, grab ya then dunk ya
Treat you like barbecue, pick you up start to chew
Throw you to the dogs when I'm done and through with you
'Cause I'm just a poet this lyrical vocalist
Suckers stay back, 'cause they all know I'm just a microphone soloist
An individual, steady gettin' deffer while they stay pitiful
Yeah, you guessed it I'm not the nice guy
I treat suckers bad, I'm not the nice one
I'm hard as hell can you tell my rhymes sell?
Just a mack from the town of Vallejo
To my young cuddie Mac yo wussup mayne
I'm nothing nice and Mac Dre's the name
Mac, Mac, Mac Dre is the name
Mac, Mac, Mac Dre is the name
That muthafuckin' name

Mac Dre's the name and the fan's stay quiet
Until I come through the door and they start up a riot
Pulling on my pants, shirt and drawers
And that is the moment I have to pause
I mean stop, yo wait a minute, hold up
Boys get the gats, bullets and load up
And if they keep trippin' you better start sprayin'
'Cause I'm not the one you know what I'm sayin?
Some like that shit but I'm not the type
Just give me a mic and watch me get hype
When I'm done yo i hit the back door
Hop in the limo cut to the store
Get a fifth of Hennessy. kick it tough in the V
With my partner Eric B, 'cause he's just a friend of me
And when i say Eric B i don't mean the DJ
I mean the Eric B, who keeps it dope for Mac Dre
The sucker MC killa, so watch me go thrilla
If i see your girl listen I'm just gonna have to pull her
Right off her boyfriend, treat her good till the end
Then leave her in the cold, let her chill out in the wind
Freaky girls, do you hear?
I'm sippin' gin, I don't bend
For this rhyme, it is done
Yo I'm up, out of here

Yeah Mac Dre
Mac Dre
Mac, Mac, Mac Dre
That muthafuckin' name
That name
That name
That muthafuckin' name
Yeah so damn hard
Straight out the V-Town
Going out to my Crestside peoples
Yo wassup E.V
Wassup Lady G
Kilo Curt, Freaky D
Big G
Mac Ray and Mac Dante
Yeah young Marty
And Ronnie Wags just get them zags you know
Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac Dre is the name

That muthafuckin' name

Millionaire Gangsta,Al Boo Boo,2003.0,"Once I turn millionaire gangsta
With 30 or 40 mill I'll be on ? or ? flapping my tail
Through the smallest cities Des Moines to Mississippi
All around through Dallas, 5 million dollar palace
With a maid like Alice cooking and tossing salad
Dodging the feds and the marshals in a ? porsche to Cali'
Frisco to the Valley got play me and rush pop the 99 tre and start aqua dre
Rapper gone bad plus the sky pad
19 inch rims I ain’t mad
Counting cash no money counters
We pack straps so we pay the club faster
We smoke Amsterdam every state that we hit
Fifty thousand twice a week
Full heated cause I’m in love with the streets
I know how snakes can be that jealously make niggas wanna kill cause they ain't winning’ like me

I’m from the streets of San Fransisco, born and raised
I grew up in this gat way back in the days
I was raised by ghetto billionaires but I can’t say names
Kansas city be the place where I’m shipping things
I got the coke for dirt cheap down in the back where I stay
And all you baller blocking niggas stay the fuck out the way
I’m getting cash money, yeah, that dirty fast money, that mansion and yacht
And that S class money
We organized crime bosses setting up shop
Taking over cities and building million dollar spots
Ya bitches is fascinated with my foreign lifestyle
I’m floss ballin’ at the bank yes ""iced out""
Well known for sending a bitch to the hoe track
Cause its gangster pimpin’ on mine
I’m a feel low mac In a big body sky blue supersport impala
Check my stats, I’m a major league baller
Knocking patches out you ? with my nigga Rich The Factor
And a rapper gone bat and young rush strapped up
And y’all can’t fuck with this Millionaire Gangsta
I said y’all can’t fuck with this Millionaire Gangsta

I never show no soft like a bar of chalk
Blowing doses with my coalition
Put it down since detention
Binge or brink not associating with counterfeits
25 a kick put me in the chronic shift
My mouthpiece rips like a weapon
The ? wanna metal so I’m organized
All my career circumsized rolling packs of 5s
Huddled up you lacking on your grin, while niggas cuddled up
Me and my niggas bubbled up bouncing raps and ? now
20 inches on a Saleen fast crosses hundred pound triple beam
Hustle dream packing M16’s with the ? attached
Took me a while to scratch the surface
Now I’m on purpose
Could be in service in church if you wanna purchase
Burn the competition with a proposition
And I always smoke on the barr fucking spinach

I’m tryna be a Millionaire Gangster but still bend corners in a Chevrolet
Do that gangster shit everyday you better check my resume
I come from a turf where rollers get whipped
Yola gets cooked
And if you floss nigga yo shit a sho get took
Me and my nigga S to the KY just hooked up with Rich and Rush
And we slicker than K-Y, Jelly
San quentin and is back up to telly
We really gonna go silly if the situation gets smelly
Then Makaveli they jelly they can’t fuck with no made men
They concentrated on hatin’, hating they pockets is thin
Its no win for them suckers in
I’m with 3 savage and motherfucker I stay paid
I’m E’d up, roll the weed up
My nigga Don Juan them bomb tracks to make a motherfucker heat up
Turn the beat up nigga you feeling it ain’t ya
Just some real niggas tryna be some millionaire gangstas
Some millionaire gangstas
Some millionaire gangstas",https://genius.com/Mac-dre-millionaire-gangsta-lyrics
Hoez Love It,Stupid Doo Doo Dumb,1998.0,"I don’t mess around. I had about four womens in my life. That’s right, ‘cause they drain ya. They do; they fuck all the time. That’s right; if you fuck one of ‘em good, you in trouble. ‘Cause she gon’ tell her friend, she gon’ want some. That’s right; and you fuck her, she gon’ tell somebody. And the next thing you know, you got to fuck eight or nine times

Now how much money can one black man make
When his game be great and seasoned like a tasty steak
No limit, I’m in it to hold loot
Collectin’ scrill like that Golden Gate toll booth
Old schoolin’ like La-Di-Da-Di
Stickin’ long donk in every hole in a bitch body
She lick pipe, but never would I taste walls
Catchin’ more hoes than Mike Piazza catch balls
Mac Dre, I keep hoes droolin’
Ragooey, still old schoolin’
’71 glass house with that white interior
Blowin’ big bomb, drinkin’, rhyme superior
151 ways I get dumb
For every ten times she cum I bust one
I got stamina, I fuck ‘til the rooster crow
Put them legs up and let me goose ya, hoe

Hoes…love it
Hoes…love it
Hoes…love it
Hoes…love it

Bossalini, it’s the muthafuckin’ thug in me
I got a gangsta bitch pushin’ all my drugs for me
Fuck ‘em then get in my Benz, rob their old boyfriend
Nigga gotta stay strapped with Desert Eagles, .44s, Mac-10s (Blaow!)
Show her how to pull the trigger
Talkin’ to this thick ass bitch like she my potna, my only nigga
Another way to get the lucci
Is to hide these ki’s up in your muthafuckin’ coochie
Extra Large in the heezay, with Mac Dreezay
Put the mac playa shit down up in the Teezay
Bitch come and go on this lick with me
Born Killers like Mickey and Mallory
You in love with a fugitive
Bounty hunters on my dick, no clues to give
Got a muthafucka dodgin’ the pigs but I’mma stay at your crib
So we can fuck on the table and barbecue us some ribs

Hoes…love it
Hoes…love it
Hoes…love it
Hoes…love it

You never met a nigga like me
The M to the D from the CCC, I’m a G
Colder than 40s fresh out the freezer
Doper than a muthafuckin’ quarter-piece’a
I got game that make hoes go get it
Funkier than two fat hoes that just shitted
On the same toilet, don’t spoil it, it’s all gracious
Keep hoes tied up like shoelaces
Mac Dre, boy, that playboy that hoes love
If your hutch act dumb, I’m gon’ shove
You can run up if you really wanna see Dre
But I don’t give a F-U-C-K
I take wives, lives, whenever it get funky
Ask your baby mama, nigga, I got donkey
Gon’ be in the Caddy when I’m in that babby
She askin’, “Mac Dre, would you be my daddy?”

Oh boy where ya been

I'm out the roof of a old school
Trynna campaign
Smokin' champagne
Doin' the damn thang
Now this a damn shame
How these smurf's hate
But these Gilligan's been trippin' since my first tape
Well here's another knock
Dope as a hover rock
For you to bump while you sidin' through the parkin' lot
After the club
Pull it on a dove
Hollerin' at hutches that's trynna get dug
Out, drout on niggas like me
M to the D from the R-O-M-P bo billy
Usin' gangsta scare tactics
Tennis shoe pimpin' in my Nike Air Max's
Back on the street after 5 in the slammer
I'm lookin' saucy somebody get a camera
Oh, you mad
I ain't mad at you
I thought you knew
I'm just doin' what I do

Bitch don't get mad if I'm not fuckin' with you (I ain't fuckin' with you)
Or fuckin' with you (Damn sure I ain't fuckin' with you)

Then I hopped out butter and she had to jock
I'm a ho magnet
Heat I'm gon' pack it
Doe I'm gon' stack it
Lick I'm gon' jack it

Back in the V, look at me, I'm livin' free
No parole
I can choke a ho
Get mail, post bail, and they gon' let me go
I'm here to let you know
This as real as it gets
I'm makin' hunks and chunks
Don't fuck with kibbles and bits
Big face, hundred dollar bills
Got me, straight face
Gunnin' for the skrill
I'm runnin' with the P.O
Goin' for 2
With the double R crew
Doin' what I do

I'm doin' what I do (This is what I do)

At the studie turnin' blunt into do-bells
With D-Con 'cause he keep the bomb
And the Crest Side be the turf where we from (Crest Sida)

Straight chip getta
And she gotta pay for Dre to get with her
No doe ho
Leave me alone

Fuck Off the Party,Rapper Gone Bad,1999.0,"What's up, what's up, let's ride
Jump in the passenger side on the 4th of July
Hella saucy and fly, didn't grind that day
I just wanted to play
And smoke with the bitches
Throw phrases at bitches
Get play from the bitches
Man, it was major bitches
At the 
Pleasanton
 fair
Ass was over here, over there
I had to stop and stare
Take a joint from my ear
Tell this bitch to come here
Let's breathe
And we even tricked the cops, though the smell of the weed
That's when they grabbed my sleeve
Told me it's time to leave
But what's next, ""You're under arrest""
So I grabbed the fuckin' cop and slapped him on his fuckin' bulletproof vest
In the process lost a shoe, ripped a hole in my Guess
That's what the fuck I get for smokin' Mexican stress
(B-I-E-I-itch, I will never switch)(Repeat 4X)

I'm at the bar doin' big shit, gettin' big lit
My niggas, dig this
A few cats lookin' like they wanna get with
So I give 'em a chance real quick, I'm real swift
It's the Wild Wild West, ask Will Smith who will peel the snitch
That howled the name that blew the brain
For foul-snitchin the game
I know my nigga Dre would do the same
So I ain't trippin' on a motherfuckin' thang
Sit back shinin' like a diamond ring
Niggas wanna see me hang
So I'm upside down, about to clown
Real gangsta shit lost and found
Kidnapped, blast in the back of the dome
Mash in a Brougham
Flashin on the phone, yelllin niggas be tellin
Flowin' like water from a melon
The seeds we spit, the seeds we sellin'
From a westbound felon
Fuckin' up your party not carin'
From a westbound felon
Fuckin' up your party not carin'
From a westbound felon
(B-I-E-I-itch, I will never switch)(Repeat 4X)

I'm at a concert high and perked with a bad bitch next to me
Blown back off Cognac, that bomb green and ecstacy
Bitches is buggin', niggas is muggin'
But bitches is lovin 'cause niggas is thuggin'
These niggas start nuttin' in the corner by the speaker
My beeper's goin' off like crazy
The scene is hazy, no time to be lazy
Got to stay on my toes, all of a sudden these hoes
Come out of nowhere and grab this nigga
They stab this nigga, I'm mad this nigga
Didn't have nothin' in his pockets when I ran through 'em
My plans is ruined, what is it I'm doin?
Looks on the flo'...no, it's not
Stupid motherfucker done dropped his Rolex watch
Put it in my pocket, proceeded to the exit
That's when this bitch I knew from the hood came through in this Lexus
I seen these other niggas beatin' down this one fool
I said, ""Here come the police, y'all better run, fool""
Soon as I said that the police drew down on us all
Now I'm at the county jail with just one phone call
Ain't that a bitch, weak-ass night
All fucked up behind a weak-ass fight

If It Ain’t Real,The Rompalation,1996.0,"Feds and the ATF, they try to clown
‘Cause we connected Fillmore with the 3C’s down
Nigga, I gets around
Mac Dre, you know these niggas’ll love to playa hate
But watch the Glock bounce, rock and skate
Through they cranium and travel to they mid-brain
More murder, more cocaine
That’s the theme, came thicker than Gold Medal flour
Y’all got the game mixed up, it’s the money then the power
And these good-for-nothing bitches come along with the riches
And on your safe, that hoe is plottin’ for the digits
Y’all got it twisted, like Mac Mall, get some Get Right
And dump on that hoe, 45 Calico infrared light
The game ain’t right, a Fillmore nigga stick to the script
Never trust a bitch with your sack, a cuddie around your scat
And sees this cat, from the F-I-double-L-M-O-iggidy
To the 7-0-Siggidy, Seff tha Gaffla, San Quinn and young Miggidy
You niggas ain’t feelin’ me, my nigga Coolio put me in the giggidy
From the SF-siggidy, to the V, if it ain’t real it ain’t riggidy

Well it’s the Unda’Dogg, with the shit that’ll make you wonder, dog
How in the fuck he spit like this, well make way, ‘cause here comes a hog
See ain’t no slackin’ up in my stackin’, steadily mackin’
And I’m gettin’ my propers on for makin’ you up a proper song
And nevertheless, I’m smokin’ my zest and drinkin’ up on that Tanqueray
Or separators, that Kahlua, milk and E&J
So what they say, they know who’s keepin’ it real, nigga
From the L.A. to the Bay, from the Crestside to the Fill’, nigga
Messy Marv, Seff tha Gaffla and San Quinn done did it
Hooked up with Mac Dre and Coolio, bustas can’t get with it
Come in on this mic, I spit it on this mic, I shitted on this mic
And keepin’ it tight, if it ain’t real it ain’t right

Man, I came way across the Bay to do this shit with Mac Dre
Fillmore, Califor-ni-a, the place the Gaffla stay
Many dues I had to pay, several cats I had to slay
Turned out a few shows, got sprayed with the pepper spray
Everything is OK, my lifestyle brings me riches
Me and Mess in a Lex, while the Quinn pops the bitches
My cousin Kelly on the phone with Julio
Damn, who made this beat? It’s my nigga Coolio
So do your duty, hoe; respect a nigga to the fullest
Every time we walk through, all you wanna do is pull us
So what you think? Do you bitches have some time?
Better yet, do you hoes have a dime?
Bein’ broke is a grind, that’s why we all comin’ tight
Bitches keep your shit tight; if it ain’t real it ain’t right

It’s your Crestside potna in this bitch off the heezy
Doin’ what I do, stayin’ true to the 3C’s
Which is we evaded D’s, makin’ G’s, takin’ these
Livin’ experiences, such as shakin’ ki’s
Breakin’ these bitches in a vicious fashion
The name is Naked, respect it or get a lashin’
I’m back and forth from the studio to the dope track
So when I grab the mic, why should I hold back?
I sold crack, way before they called it yay
Done been to prison, now I’m back with my boy Mac Dre
Stackin’ pay as I say my say and do my dues
An actual factual muthafucka, I thought you knew

It never stop, it never quit, so represent my residence
To the highest, we the flyest muthafuckas since United
Not divided but unified, retaliate to the murder, I
Hope they let kill it when I be feelin’ what’s inside my ass
Quick to blast, slow to speak, we can grip or chunk ‘em
Heated discussions always lead to somethin’ that might be dumpin’
Pumpin’ raw ‘caine to the veins without a flaw
I answer y’all so profane how I came to your fuckin’ jaw
Haters can’t get around me, I sport that sucka repellent
From a mile away, I spot a sucka smellin’ like he jealous
Well of us goodfellas, we only goodfellas
The hotelers will forever be drug sellers and dank smokers
Too ferocious to approach in the wrong fashion
We mashin’, assassins, a silence with violence
Is life, bitches get macked, riches get stacked
Since I’m on the track, I say the true facts
From the Bay to Montego, servin’ this game to my people
That’s lethal, you know how we do, nigga

On your marks, get set, you suckas better get ready
I’m steppin’ out your dreams like a nigga named Freddy
Krueger, the name rhymes with 9-millimeter Luger
And fuckin’ with mine, punk nigga, I’ll do ya
3C’s down is where I chill at, get my scrill at
Stay real at, and every day I get scratch
It’s like an itch, and I’m addicted
So Lord could you please help me get this
Monkey off my back before I gets my gat
Put it to your dome, and dare you to talk back
Ain’t no slackin’ on my pimpin’, bitch, don’t put up a fight
A nigga gots to come tight, if it ain’t real it ain’t right

It’s the Mac named Dre from the C-R-E-S-T
Gettin’ dough with my folks from the ‘Moe, young Messy
Marv and we starvin’ for more dollars
So we pimps a bitch and get hoe dollars
See, I love to floss but keep it real though
Droppin’ sauce with boss playas from Fillmore
Now pay close attention as I put this script down
And rap about these suckas and these bitches they kick down
I’m Mac Dre, and I’m hooked with the Romp crew
And getting’ filthy rich off a bitch is what Romp do
Playa haters hate to see a young brotha ridin’
From the other side, you hear ‘run, brotha, hide’
‘Cause I be servin’ muthafuckas with this Double-R press game
A goddamn savage comin’ straight out the Crest, mayne
3C soldier Double-R for life
And if it ain’t real, cuddie, you know it ain’t right",https://genius.com/Mac-dre-if-it-aint-real-lyrics

(At the Honeycomb Hideout, I side out
Fish, tell 'em where the hook, check it on the ride out)
Ford, Chev, whatever ya got
It don't mean shit if the shit ain't hot
(Rally stripes with them D-boy pipes
Make you think about strikin' when they flash them lights)
Lincoln, Caddy, whatever ya got
Push it, man, don't be scared to squat
(Such a fine ride with the perfect paint
At the red light and you can't wait to race)

Cam, lifters, MSD shifter
351 make the old school swifter
Rack on the trunk, slap in the trunk
Fat four-four in my lap for the funk
Talkin' to a beezy on the phone but can't hear her
Turned down the hump, so I can hear clearer
I hear sirens get nearer
Red and blue lights in my rearview mirror
Pull over, nope nope
With a car full of smoke and trunk full of dope
I hit the gasser, go faster
All you hear is dual exhaust, flowmaster
On a chase, I take 'em, then shake 'em
A real Cutthoat nigga, ain't no fakin'
I shoot, ain't scared to scoot
And shake the one time on a hot pursuit

Ford, Chev, whatever ya got
It don't mean shit if the shit ain't hot
(I roll so outta control, windows on tint so I'm not exposed)
Lincoln, Caddy, whatever ya got
Push it, man, don't be scared to squat
(At the Honeycomb Hideout, I side out
Fish, tell 'em where the hook, check it on the ride out)
Ford, Chev, whatever ya got
It don't mean shit if the shit ain't hot

Make you think about strikin' when they flash them lights)
Lincoln, Caddy, whatever ya got
Push it, man, don't be scared to squat

At the red light and you can't wait to race)

Ford, Chev, whatever ya got
It don't mean shit if the shit ain't hot
Lincoln, Caddy, whatever ya got
Push it, man, don't be scared to squat

Yeah, I wouldn't give a fuck what you're drivin', mayne
Be it Lincoln, be it Caddy, be it Ford, be it Chevy
Nigga, get further, mayne
Don't sit there and get caught by the police, mayne
I'ma tell ya, mayne, it's nothin'
Burn rubber all down the block...and don't stop

We'll roll you, we'll roll youuuu!

Pull up slappin in me Chrysler LeBaron
Twisted off that happy, Bobby Darrin
The Hutches had me, jockin, starin
Is it the Nikes I'm rockin or the ice I'm wearin?
I won't pout over it, I ain't sharin
I'm a home run hitter, Mr. Mack Hank Aaron
The Mack ain't carin {*coughin*} I'm cutthroatish
No dough bootch, you gettin my dick to notice
I'm clean like a greedy genius, stay fiendish
All up to par, star in the zenith
I'm leanin, dippin, blazin my sippin
Tapers or vapors mayne, we ain't trippin
So focused cousin, suds keep me buzzin
Ridin and sidin, you thought that I wasn't?
Stuntin, young blood push the button
We slumpin and bumpin, cutty it ain't nuttin!

Me and Mac Dre - ridin and leanin!
Hittin on 4's - runnin dippin steamin!
Comin yo' way - ridin on chrome!
Rollin down the block - bringin heat to yo' dome!
We'll roll you - right on out
We'll punk you - right on out
We'll roll you - right on out
We'll punk you - right on out

I'm leaned way back when I stack my bread
Might scare yo' momma with them nappy-ass dreads
I'm in my zone, my mind is gone
I feel so good, couldn't be no wrong
I feel savage, let me smash the beat up
Twist up the cabbage, kack my feet up
I'm V'd up, cause I need the dough
And I stay with a slumper, that's all I know
We gon' roll you
Right on out!
That's right bitch, right on out, slide on out
Hurt's out, I gets further
And when I'm on the beat, bitch, call it murder
I kill the track, make a swift feel The Mack
And make a punk rock, show me where the skrilla at
Copper quit spillin that, it's almost 2
With no mo' liquor nigga what we gon' do?

Lavish Habits,Pill Clinton,2007,"Got myself an Uzi and my brother a nine
In these streets you live one day at a time
Got myself an Uzi and my brother a nine
In these streets you watch your back I’ll watch I

Old school like Rowdy Roddy, or La Di Da Di
Only play for Cali teams like Vlade
Quick to turn out the muthafuckin’ party
Beam me up, Scotty, ‘fore I murk somebody
I know ca-razy, don’t know karate
Square nigga get smacked with the 12-gauge shotty
Black John Gotti, I do it mobby
Beat niggas for a hobby like The Beast Mugabi
About 9-1-1, my niggas, it’s urgency
Somebody getting sent to emergency
I’m in a burgundy Monarch from Mercury
I got new whips but I guess it’s the turf in me
You never heard of me? Nigga, wake up
I’m the really real, them niggas is cake up
Do it thuggish ruggish, all the time
Keep myself an Uzi and my brother a nine

Got myself an Uzi and my brother a nine
In these streets you live one day at a time
(One day, one day)
Got myself an Uzi and my brother a nine
In these streets you watch your back I’ll watch I

You watch your back, and I’ll watch I
It’s me against the wall like Biggie, Ready To Die
My Uzi weigh a ton, I still pack a gun
I’m still an outlaw, living life on the run
My life is no fun, I take it one day at a time
(Bought myself an Uzi and my brother a nine)
So I could enjoy the sunshine when I’m pushing my whip
Top down on the strip with 50 in my clip
Just in case emergency and niggas wanna trip
Runnin’ off at the lip, you niggas’ll get hit
I leave you lit like a Bic for talkin’ shit, how you hit
Cats don’t know what you dealing with, my niggas are sick
And when we ride through, we walk the walk with no talk
Beanie and boost the troops outlined in yellow chalk
Think I’m playing? Ask the dead man was I playing
When I bust two shots through his dome and left him laying on the ground

Got myself an Uzi and my brother a nine
In these streets you live one day at a time
(One day, one day)
Got myself an Uzi and my brother a nine
In these streets you watch your back I’ll watch I

Ain’t I’m clean...Ain’t I’m clean...Ain’t I’m clean
Ain’t I’m clean...

I’m a dope rhyme thinkin’, Hennessy drinkin’
Nigga that’ll do a drive-by in a Lincoln
Crazy muthafucka, straight sick in the mind
Man, fuck everybody, it’s me and my nine
Switchblade in my pocket, AK in the trunk
And when I drink fifth of Heem and get sloppy drunk
I’m ready to do something bad to a nigga
Straight itchin’ to pull that trigga
Rat-a-tat-tat with my Uzi machine
No hesitation when I’m doing my thing
‘Cause niggas nowadays have no respect (No respect)
I cut ‘em by myself, put niggas in check
Punk this, punk that, punk, here’s my gat
I ride around town with it on my lap
‘Cause ain’t no tellin’ when funk jumps off
I gotta be first to get mine off
Since age 13 I’ve been breaking laws
Running up in cars with dope in my draws
Servin’ dope fiends them boulders (boulders)
Steady soakin’ game gettin’ older (gettin’ older)
Started back when I used to smoke a little weed
I got my first cot when I played Little League
A young fool, way too cool
Hit the 7th Grade, said ‘Fuck some school’
I used to go so I could just hang out
Always hear the teachers yell my name out
Young Dre, always up to no good
Sittin’ in a class with a Walkman under my hood
Bumpin’ $hort, rappin’ to “Friends”
Sellin’ two dime and joints just to make some ends
The young proper, way too proper
Muthafuckin’ Mac, straight cherry popper
Street fiend, never at home
But when I was, I known to bone
Blowin’ little girl’s brains up is how I came up
Gettin’ ‘em hot, hittin’ the spot, makin’ ‘em all flame up
When I was young, I loved to fuck
Break dumb hoes and make some suck
I was a sex fiend, but never did I eat the cot
I got ‘em wet and like I savage I would beat the cot
In ’85, started cravin’ for mail
Then came the yayo and then I started to sell
Out on the block, I used to slang rocks
All damn day with the rollers on my jock
I shook and shake ‘em, on chases I would take ‘em
Tryna flip me a drop, a set of Vogues and some Daytons
Way too shob, hooked with the mob
Gats had my back, I didn’t have to squab
They didn’t understand my money-makin’ attitude
I kept stackin’ and my bank got fatter, dude
Slangin’ rock daily in my neighborhood
To the roamers on the corners and they pay me good
Hotter than grits, I went straight through the back door
With six, had another chance to stack mo’
Thangs was cool, no funk with the Southside
It got funky then a nigga had to hoo-ride
Eight deep in a mob shot Chevrolet
Police fuckin’ with a nigga, man, every day
In and out of the juvenile system
They try to tell me but a nigga wouldn’t listen
Got popped, dropped in the boys ranch
White judge couldn’t give a black boy a chance
It was crazy but the time didn’t faze me
I wrote raps on my bunk being lazy
Touched down cold in the studio
Makin’ demos with my homeboy Coolio
Straight spit, talkin’ down on a hoe
Then Khayree put my tape in the sto’
Mac Dre, boy
Rock the Bay, boy
So vicious, a muthafuckin’ playboy
They let it beat on the street for a little while
Then I told ‘em ‘bout the California lifestyle
That I live but the vision I keep spittin’
Buy my mixtape, muthafucka, ‘cause it’s hittin’
(‘Cause it’s hittin’)

Yeah, Mac Dre, goddamn
I’m way too … you know
I’ma just maintain my composure and do my time like a soldier
Yeah, that’s right, muthafucka
Come out just a little bit harder, blowin’ muthafuckas out the water
Yeah, you don’t hear me though

Cash Withdrawls,Starters In The Game,2008.0,"(Mac Dre):Rocc, she look kinda cool huh
I like the look but what's in the purse mayne?
The look is cool mayne, but baby what's in the purse?
The look is cool...

He don't get out it cause he think he can't afford it
I'ma play the bitch like a tape recorder, I make nacho
I get cheese and chips she don't got dough? I'ma leave the bitch
Cause a bitch with no money can't give me no money, she always laughing but ain't a damn thing funny
The joke's on you baby, you're through baby pretty face and big booty just ain't gone do baby
Where I'm from? bitch you's a loser
I'm a woozer? Nigga I'ma use her make the bitch run like she still in  and get thick faces
I'm Mac Dre this the big ole pimp
He in the Benz behind the tint
4 EV's 4 EP's playing BBD's going off three G's

I get money nigga, she get money bring it all to me
Stalking a  put miles on her feet yeah I know
I'm this, I'm that I ain't shit but I'm only out to ball leave it all on that bitch on my whips
On my fits and on my chips we got big grip, big deals and big hits plus I spit big game
Get up in your bitch brain convince her to get changed motherfucka it's a pimp thang
That's trill mayne I'm all about stacking a grill (while my hands are writing raps count cash and slapping a bitch)
I'm up in this bitch when I do this, nigga I recruit chicks like the high school in a young bitch ear like a cutip

In the skates or at the mall, I'm still collecting drawls whether darksin or red bones, fresh hair and painted toes
When I leave they're on my phone, cause I'm all in their dome
And my goal's to hook them all, to make my cash withdawls

 produced big body tours
Now I peace like a cannon it's so heated
Dime piece she understand it so I feel I beat it
Dropped her off then skeet see I'm a young Mac
Manipulating young racks to get my chips,  to my lips tricks follow her here
Get more cheese than  sit on cheese and whips  to get cheese
Call me valvida mob is dangerous like a 7o with a heater
Said her name was  you don't need her non-profit organization let the whip fill feeder
With pimp shit I greet her campaign like I'm running for office
Campaign cause you know who the boss is
It's genuine  Sidewayz spin the past winning all fast
Money off the track like their  these squares ain't eating

I've been on some whole other shit
But it's time to go I been first to get to moving on a nigga like he was a prison snitch
Scrubbing niggas off the map like some Ajax stuck a pitbull bitch watch out for this pimp attack
I got to lace this track like a taylor lace a Mac
Explaining how I make money fall out the buttcrack
Eyes glossed up from fucking with the ecstacy silly 
Best to be dude always on your P's and Q's like Brotha Lynch mayne  refuse to lose
But in this game you guaranteed to get knocked and bruised
But stay pimping dude 

Well it's official I'm a factor in these streets (streets)
We jack niggas for beats and give a fuck about making enemies off Hennessey and Remy so I'm a goddamn fool
Catch a bitch with a government check and I'ma cop that too
Take the DF tattoo but it's not for dungeon families thats for  finest tell me do you understand me?
I'm sour, never sweet like candy bitches tryna get at me cause of this pimping mentality  now they mad at me
For the shit that I did to this kid got her coming out that dig now we're doing it big
We stacking up chips to back niggas up off the dick cause they hating all on my status  to living lavish
But I still manage to remain savage avoid faggots got it snatching habits dangnabbit its cold mackin
Snatch up for this fame if you lames can't feel me and dig deep off in your brain and put this thang to make you feel me",https://genius.com/Mac-dre-cash-withdrawls-lyrics
The Coldest MC,The Best of Mac Dre Volume Two,1997.0,"Mac muthafuckin' Dre, bitch
Back through here, doing something vicious
Spittin' that shit that ya like
You know, this what I want y'all to do
Check this out...

Light yourself a dank joint, letcha mind go
Listen to these lyrics as I let this rhyme flow
I'm funky with this shit 'cause my style is authentic
It keeps them suckas jockin', so my windows stay tinted
I meant it when I said ""I will pimp til I die""
Makin' them bitches cry
And nigga, dont ask me why
I flow that pimp shit 'cause I know that pimp shit
I smoke that hemp shit, not with that simp shit
Stupid doo-doo dumb is the only way I come
Let the track ride, gimme the mic and I'll run
Smooth with the groove like a saxophone
My raps is on, and man, caps is blown
Straight off suckas' heads with the rhymes I shoot
Fuckin' with the bitch if she's kinda cute
I find her loot, I shake the spot
You'll never hear a bitch say I ate the cot
I mack, kick back, and stack that cash
I throw these thangs, fool, don't make me tap that ass
The Mac named Dre is the man for real
Hoes wanna ride in me Sedan DeVille
'Cause I'm a, young playa with that Crestside game
Kickin' the funky shit, making the rest sound lame

And every time I rap, I bust what cha like
'Cause I'm the coldest MC to ever touch a mic
Every time I rap, I bust what cha like
'Cause I'm the coldest MC to ever touch a mic

They trips when I spits 'cause I'm nothing respectable
But still when I spill, boy, I'm nothing correctable
I got raps that make niggas say ""Goddamn
He a fool with the mic in his hand""
I could teach a square everything he's lackin'
'Cause partna, I'm a playa with some uncut mackin'
I spit shit that makes tricks go run and hide
Down them clowns around town, they wonder why
I never give a bitch who ain't rich the time of day
They got me fucked up if they think that I'ma pay
I'ma play, until she's all played out
Have her friends sayin' ""Damn girl, you Mac Dre'd out!""

'Cause every time I rap, I bust what cha like
'Cause I'm the coldest MC to ever touch a mic
Every time I rap, I bust what cha like
'Cause I'm the coldest MC to ever touch a mic

At the drop of a dime, I can rhyme a tight rap
And make a motherfucker say ""Damn, he like that""
Gifted with the tongue that will run for many miles
Gettin' niggas sprung 'cause I come with many styles
Hoes come in rows to get chose, they gettin' wit me
Saying I'm the flyest on the side of the Mississippi
Banned in six states by the surgeon general
I'm known to be addictive, sellin' dope subliminals
And I don't stop servin' like them fools at Denny's
Like Julius Erving, Michael Jordan, and Penny
I go coast to coast with a dose of this realness
Slappin' your brain with this game, can you feel this?
I flow like river water, ain't no nigga harder
Others that was rockin' is forgotten like Jimmy Carter
But I'm gon' be around, just like hand-me-downs
An old-ass playa still pullin' them panties down

And every time I rap, I bust what cha like
'Cause I'm the coldest MC to ever touch a mic
Every time I rap, I bust what cha like
'Cause I'm the coldest MC to ever touch a mic",https://genius.com/Mac-dre-the-coldest-mc-lyrics
Choke’n Off Dank,Pill Clinton,2007,"Chillin' at a house party, me and my 40
Chokin' off dank rolled up in a pierogi
Cot everywhere, I mean the bitches was at that
I'm peepin' the scene seeing who I'm a mac at
This bitch walked in lookin real prizznity
With no hesitation, I step to the brizznity
Said, ""How you doin', baby, can I spit at you?
Saucy young tender, can I get at you?""
She musta recognized the potent pimpin' on sight
'Cause she was jockin' MD for the rest of the night
We smoked dank, and drank Tanqueray
I said, ""Baby, are you sure you can hang with Dre?""
With the party still poppin' we shook the spot
Cut to my Brougham and I took the cot
For 25 minutes MD was shovin' it
She was screamin' my name and I could tell she was lovin' it
Cock was thrusted, nuts was busted
In this no good bitch that some nigga trusted
Pulled up my pants and she put on some lipstick
Went back in the party feelin' pimperistic
I couldn't help but notice that this nigga was starin'
I thought he was trippin' off the clothes I was wearin'
But, he stepped to MD and said, ""What's up, punk?
You been fuckin' my bitch and now I want some funk""
I said, ""I'm not with the drama so you can save the theatrical
I macked on your bitch 'cause she appeared to be mackable""
But instead of this nigga being real on a playa
He took a step back and tried to steal on a playa
I said, ""Look fool, nobody smashes Dre
I throw these thangs like young Cassius Clay""
With one blow, I sent the punk to the flo'
And said, ""Get your ass up if you want some more""
These niggas ran up, they musta been his crew
Now tell me what the fuck was I supposed to do?
Cut to the Brougham and got the M-double-8
So I can get these muthafuckas from up out of my face
Let off a rat-a-tat, hopped in my Cadillac
And burned long rubber on them suckas I gatted at
Yeah

I got my choppa on my left with my finger on the trigga
Rollin' in a glasshouse feelin' like that nigga
Suckas started static last night now I'm searchin'
Finna put some work in, 'gnac got me perkin'
Seen a sucka posted with his bitch at the liquor store
Put in the clip and go, didn't mean to hit the ho
Fully automatic Mac-11 spittin' fast
Make sure I get that ass, then I hit the gas
Punch it to the hood, switchin' up now I'm back
Rollin' in the 'Lac, still sippin 'gnac
Rollers to their right get behind me, I don't trip
They lookin' for a nigga in a Chev, I don't slip
High speed chase if they want to harass me
Put the lights on, switch lanes then pass me
Had me kinda noid but no longer am I spooked
And man, like I said, if they jacked me they was juked
Creep to the spot where the homeboys romp
Niggas on the dice gettin' paid shootin' twamps
30 minutes later pockets fat now I'm cool
Steppin' out the house, niggas scream ""Get that fool""
Suckas smash up in the deuce and a squirrel
Three bald heads and a nigga with a curl
Bullets let loose, I get it in the chest
Fools smash off screamin', ""Trick, fuck the Crest""
Waitin' for the muthafuckin' ambulance
Thinkin' to myself: I don't stand a chance
Dizzy and my breathing is impossible
Next thing I know I'm at the hospital
Wakin' up hurt, fresh out the trauma
Lookin' at my bitch, and my baby's mama
They tryna act cool, but I know they hate it
My baby's mama said, ""Damn Dre, you barely made it""
Straight tore back, sore than a muthafucka
Thinkin' to myself: Man, I gotta smoke another sucka
Chillin', illin', back on the street
Strapped with my gat layin' in the back seat
Got a white boy drivin' lookin' like a nerd
Rollin' in a fucked up Thunderbird
Got my gloves on, hoodie and my mask and
Mad than a muthafucka, finna do some blastin'
We hit this dope track like we lookin' for some rocks
And I hop out the back door and quickly get to poppin'
Suckas start droppin', and I stop cappin'
And hop back in, just like nothin' happened
I'm puttin' in work, killin' fools dissin'
A muthafuckin' savage, a nigga on a mission

I here voices saying ""Oh gee, He rappin'?""
Its mackin' funky fresh in the flesh
You might see me in the traffic rolling SS

Or maybe Range Rovin' perkin' with some babby
It's daddy recruitin' hoes that love goosin'
Robbin' and shootin', indulge in prostitution
I'm goosin', juicin' and game inducin'
To claim restitution, I ain't got no suits and
Quit mother goosin' this ain't no story

It's me, MD, bitch follow me
And we can get paid for dick swallowing
Bada bing bada bang, it really ain't no thang
I'm deep in this game, and you a freak in this game
So we can exchange the pimpin' for the ho-in
Baby you ain't knowin' the top is where I'm goin'
There's no one that could ever do it better
I gets my cheddar, mozzarella or whatever...
Or whatever, the earth is my turf
Where I roam is my home, cutthoat rolling stone

Countin' fetti while I'm sucking on tetties

Got a dumb flow, keep more than one ho
It's Mr. Hicks in the mix nigga hear me in the gumbo
Run ho, you're square as a box
And I'm a thug, the kind of guy that'll swear to your pops

I’m at the bar, jibbin’ at hoes, poppin’ it
They eatin’ it, and spillin’ it, they moppin’ it
Lovin’ your cousin because I’m a sav
Gone off them thizzles, ‘bout one and a half
It’ s me and Cisco, we in Frisco
And I’m bustin’ at bitches like a pistol
It’s so crazy up in here
I’m tryna shake a square beezy, ‘cause she…

She ain’t nothin’ but some pimp’s hoe
Mac Dre and Cisco X game tremendo, blowin’ on indo
Break all nymphos, straight or lesbo
Lesbhonest with the ill na na wanna menage a trois
With me and the potna, freaky like Madonna
Biting on my heels like a piranha
That’s club drama, I love Henny and pina coladas
Swing a big stick, get you wide open like a piñata

It’s too many hoes up in here
For a pimp not to get chose up in here


Bounce, rock, perk wit’ me
Put the dank in the blunt, baby, work wit’ me
I’m going nutso, wit’ my cutthroat
Young Suavearachi, what’s up, loc?
We doin’ big thangs, ‘cause we big people
On damn near drugs like it’s legal
I couldn’t feel no lav-er, or feel no sav-er
She’s looking kinda famous, cuddie, go grab her

Now when I call, you respond no matter what the weather
Come through in your thong, nobody does it better
Than I do, but you already knew that, boo
Nobody gives head better than you
If the pussy’s mine, let me cool, just keep it on ice
(see, if I thrust ya once, hoe, I’mma thrust ya twice)
See I’m a hustler, so it’s a must I get paid
Customary like Hawaii, touch down and get laid/lei’d

It’s too many hoes up in here
For a pimp not to get chose up in here


I’m comin’, baby, like the big brown kahuna
Plenty of fish in the sea, plenty more hoes around the corner
If you want, I’ll beat him down, show you how to pop your collar
Every time I’m back in town I’mma give you a holler
Maybe we could hookup at the Holiday Inn
You could come through, baby, and bring your friends
See, me and Mac Dre’s in town, captain, hide your hoes
‘Cause you know what happens if I get chose

I go buck looie when I let loose
Playin’ “Hutch, Hutch, Choose” like “Duck, Duck, Goose”
Oh boy, it’s nothin’, I mack for sport
Runnin’ full press game up and down the court
Mac Drevious the craziest cutthoat, fool
Maybe it’s the gravy in my cutthoat soup
That make it so saucy, keepin’ it so flossy
Do it big, Bay style, real bossy

It’s too many hoes up in here
For a pimp not to get chose up in here

Now when we run outta looie, we put doobies in a crutch too
Hits’ll make your chest bust, sticky to the touch
If I see a hutch, with some cheeseballs in a clutch
Like a pimp, dawg, I pick it up, pick it up
Give it up, turn it loose, silly duck, it’s no use
You fuckin’ with the golden goose
Hawkeye surrounded by pigeons holding on a deuce-deuce
The reason why all the chickenheads flew the coop

They Don’t Understand,Young Black Brotha (LP),1993.0,"Feat Ray Luv

Once upon a time, before I had a 9
I didn't have to grind all the time
Thangs was cool and brothers hung out
The South with the North and the North with the South
As time went on I started cravin for mail
Then came the yayo and then I started to sell
Money, money, money was all I knew
Cause 24-7 the fiends came through
Luxurious livin in the fast lane
But little did I know it wouldn't last, mayne
From sellin the base cocaine I caught me a case
And then they put me away in a correctional place
They said I was beyond parental control
A hard-headed fool with no mental control
But for months and months I wrote and wrote
And when I got out of jail, I was funky and dope

Yeah I was straight spittin it to them fools up there, man
They didn't understand this mouthpiece I had, you know
I knew I was comin up
Yo, that's what I try to tell 'em, man
They don't realize it's a straight come up in the nineties
Aiyo, but what happened when you got back to the hood, though?

Back in the hood thangs was so different
The rollers was jackin and the brothers was trippin
Uzis and 9's was kept in the trunk
Cause the North and the South had high-powered funk
Thinkin to myself: Dre, leave it alone
Khayree hooked me up with a microphone
Deeper and deeper the funk kept on getting
But I wasn't trippin, I had to keep spittin
Now I'm cold chillin on the t-o-p
And still ain't trippin off the funk, baby
And if you don't get the point of the story I tell
Quit trippin off the funk and make some mail

I grew up on the westside of Ro'
Slangin and gangbangin, hangin and smokin do'
'Stay in the house, don't even think about goin out!'
My room was a jail cell, so young Ray sneaks out
I run with the rat pack, stack that, jack that
Need some for gold ones, then go mack that
Tender for dollars and don't take no less
Than a c-note and stack that with the rest
Thinkin and knowin it's all about the game
Dropped out of school for big fortune and much fame
Runnin around with a rag in your knapsack
Necks is cracked, Jack, now you pack, black
Why? To smoke another brother-man
Mac Dre, I don't see why don't understand

Never was much of an athlete
Always craved stages and pages of rhyme sheets and rap beats
Working inside my room through the late night
Damn near goin blind writin rhymes by a dim light
Changin up my styles, learnin to flow fast and slow
Kickin the funky tempo, bass breakin the bedroom window
But now at age 19 I'm made with a crazy fade
Pockets feelin fat because a brother's crazy paid
Back to where I used to kick it at
But since it got crazy everyone comes with a gat
Got myself a ounce and a bottle of boons
I checked my watch cause I knew I had help soon
Now I'm just sittin here thinkin 'bout days past
When the police stayed in a brother's ass
While some brothers every week were gettin bailed out
I stayed my little black behind out of the jail house",https://genius.com/Mac-dre-they-dont-understand-lyrics

All the double R

9-2 man
91 was a long one
A sad one, a bad one
Or should i say a wrong one
The mac got killed
Bitches got pilled and shit
Jacking stacking a fat
Packing a gatt
Wearing silk n' shit
Times got crazy nigga's went wild
Or recession just depressing
You thing i give a fuck child please
Am trying to get my G's
Every night on my knees
Praying before i get my Z's
Cause at ease ain't how am feeling
Am ready for the killing
So i get me an O-Z and start dope dealing
Rocks to the fiend
Then me n' the crew fell out
I got the hell out quick
Thinking my mamma did i bell out, shit
Am stuck like chuck mad as fuck
And Down on my luck
So a nigga know he gotta come up
Be strong and move along
So ding dong down
But i ain't going out
So i'm about the come around
To my senses nigga
No longer a senseless nigga
I got defences nigga
Thats get my riches
Pulling my bitches
Telling the crew i love em' fool
Living a life
And giving a try to shop?
Because they hella cool
My nigga got locked up and also got jocked
But shit these days create crazy ways
I guess it's california livin'
So to the diggity double R
Nigga all my fucking time is given

Yea coolio i know times are ruff
Steady on the grind cause theres never enough
Motherfuckers jacking and they blame it on me
Got my motherfucking peoples even thinking it me
Attorney bills take a big chunk of my bank
To get through the day i keep fucking with dank
On the crest side streets all day i strive
Often drifting of reminiscing of mic
Hoes on my dick like rats on cheese
Am steady saying no
She steady saying please
Six foot one
Slim and fly
Love slanging that j-i-m-m-y
Ya put the D to the I to the C to the K
And thats all you get from young mac ass dre
The lyrical rap speaking
Never be getting weaken
Continue to spit the pimping shit
And keep the fans peaking
The Twenty-four and then some
Cock am always in some
Love to spit a rap
Shoot some craps and try to win some
Cold cash money
Some mothafucking duckets
Sometimes I roll lit
Sometimes a ride a bucket
Got a cuddy named truck-it
I make the hoe's suck it
Don't jerk jerk jerk it, I fuck fuck fuck it
Keep my pants cuffed, my zig zags stuffed
The riggity romp life I could never get enough of
Peep game and let the shit soak man
I got the dope and I don't slang coke man
Cold kicking it loving how im living
And to the double R all my time is given",https://genius.com/Mac-dre-2-the-double-r-lyrics
Well Connected,Treal T.V. Soundtrack,UnKnown,"I'm out of this world, not your run of the mill'n
My name is fur I'm the owner of the building
I'm a stoner and I'm chillin with two bitches like Jack
I pimps and I mac drive a Benz and a 'lac
Man I've been in the back wit the groupies and the stars
I've been out front with the thugs in the cars
I've been in the yard with the Mexican mafia
And I only run with niggas that'll kill and die for ya
I'm popular, I'm a rap star
But I live like a rock star running from the cop cars
I drop bars wit slaps that knock hard
And I charge with this dick extra large
I'm sick of these whores higher than Mars
And I treat my bitch like an ATM card

I'm in the buildin and I'm feelin myself
Man I'm feelin myself
She's in the buildin and she's feelin herself
She's lookin bad man I'm willing to help
Stop it baby your killin yourself
Come on I got your back you could chill in my
I'm feelin myself too
Man imagine some of the things we can do
You under me
Me under you
Then we can catch the liquor store before 2:00
We can hit my nigga and go get some shrooms
And if you still want to kick it then we can go get a room
It won't cost you much
I'm a good guy
Dick-on-discount bitch good bye
What do I look like mr. Frank Fuck for Free
No Dope Hoe you can't fuck with me
Get the fuck out
Bitch you still on my dick
You full of shit and I'm feelin myself

I'm a Westcoast Bad Boy, I represent it
Wait that's a bad tune is it rented
Hardy har har very funny
You don't hear my tummy, I gets my money
My stomach ain't growlin, I'm stylin and whylin
Drink vodka straight fuck the Long Island
I want my own Island bet you I'm a get it
I switch hit and play with both mits
I pack a 45th Im after your bitch
He ain't doing it right shes after your scritch
And I'm after hers with these macing words nerd
I thawed squares stage shark
Your nothing but a mark in a fuckin Sky Lark

And bitches kick down, y’all niggas get down
And represent what’s been lackin’, playas
It’s the Crest, the combination of two mackin’ playas

I be that five-hundred-thirty-five percent
Niggas sessed out every time I rhyme
Backwood twister, it’s Strictly SES on mine
Takin’ my pictures with saucy Caddies in a line
Fuck the world, nigga, I’m gonna spend this good green
On some rope and fully things
Spittin’ throwaway O’s and pipe dreams
Got a crew full of playas and they all like me
So don’t speak to my 5 if a choppa in reach
I’m representin’ young titans, soldiers, playas feel shit I’m writin’
We flow straight dope and well you’re just another client
So kick in before you get your door kicked in
Crestsiders, boy, we at it again
All up in your shit, tellin’ muthafuckers ‘strip’
Cuddie, oh, they didn’t know this a muthafuckin’ lick
So you can fuck with the mob or don’t fuck around at all

And represent what’s been lackin’, playas

Hand me the rap tapes, what a Mac made for them suckas to see
That all them late ass niggas really can’t fuck with me, see
I’m M.D., the, V-Town governor
A title well-earned because I be keepin’ ‘em lovin’ a
Candy-coated thing that be sweeter than Reese’s
See, niggas like me is endangered species
How many niggas you know that can flow and keep it really real?
Be on that hoe, and when she owe, boy, I’mma spill
That uncut and untuck po pimpin’ ass game
But I won’t buck and won’t touch ‘til I’m up in a Range
See, I’m lovin’ livin’ lavish, cuddie, so when I ain’t splurgin’
I’m goosin’ up the cabbage in her mind like a brain surgeon
I ain’t hurtin’, you know I’m stackin’ them dollars
Comin’ fresh out the pen strikin’ brand new Impalas
Givin’ it up to my folks and them know, boy, the Country Club
Givin’ up the dope so they can soak off this funky dub

It’s the Crest, the combination of two mackin’ playas

See, I’m a, half hog, other half cold Crest dog
Saucy pit, super hard on a bitch
I switch hoe tricks like Nikes and Guess fits
Baby pop that lip soon to see the payment
You might catch me bent, dunkin’ broads like Kemp
We be smokin’ roper, she be suckin’ Mall’s dick
We be ridin’ Caddy, know that hoe notch quick
When we hit the Carquinez, baby, drink that shit
If I’m too hoggish for y’all, please excuse my penmanship
But I’m from that Country Club where we mob and pull licks
Muthafuckas can’t see Mall, I’m jumpin’ for that gang green, y’all
I’m a creeper, tie you up in your drawers

When I step to the mic, suckas close they eyes
‘Cause they ain’t tryna see me expose the lies
I see niggas frontin’ and I step to ‘em
‘Cause I’m true to the game, mayne, I gotta do ‘em
That fake shit that they spit is play shit and gay shit
And Dre spit is they shit, you never hear me say shit
That’s ruthless or truthless, that punk shit is useless
I spill the real with skill, niggas can’t juke this
I shoots this, and when I demonstrate
I don’t perpetrate, duplicate or imitate
Raps I originate, saps I eliminate
‘Cause all the women hate when niggas tend to fake
Man, I’m finna shake, the fakes and frauds
Stick to the script and break some broads

Oh, how these haters hate when a nigga skate
I'm up the block with mark doin' knots
As I think about the hash that I just got from Josh
Pass it to dump, said ""Let's get blunted""
He said, ""Ooh, I look like eleven five hundred""

Pops in a nigga cot, gotta fasten her
And a little game, guess it's just a little thang
That them hoes do, you know a nigga know you

So many condoms on the floor you think it’s an orgy
So many choppas in the car you think it’s an Army

Everything I ever want is all on her

Ya gotta have that donkeeeeey
Ya love that donkeeeeey (Can't live without it)
You can't live without that donkeeeeey, yeeaaaah

I remember we played hide and go get it
Back in the days, girl, you wasn't wit' it
Then you started wearing tight jeans on your hips
And cherry red lipstick on your lips
You really started lovin' to be with the guys
But you still wasn't thrustin', you was teasin' the guys
But niggas got mad and started dissin'
Which drove you to do somethin' more than kissin'
It happened one night, after the flick
Your boyfriend's dick was smooth on brick
He licked ya ear, kissed ya neck
And got ya virgin pussy smooth drippy wet
Ya said ""Stoooop! I'm not ready
Besides, we in the back of a chevy""
But he kept on, he didn't even beg
Slipped his middle finger between ya legs
When he played wit'cha cot, ya started to moan
From that point, he knew it was on
Thirty long minutes you got G'd
He destroyed some shit and smooth made ya bleed

Ya love that donkeeeeey (DONKEY)
Ya gotta have that donkeeeeey (Gotta have that donkey)
Ya love that donkeeeeey (Love that donkey)
You can't live without that donkeeeeey, yeeaaaah
You was fuckin' and fuckin', G'in and G'n
Even did the ???? ??? when ya pussy was bleedin
Then one day ya man got popped
Yer lil cak got real hot
Hotter than hot girl i mean bakin!
Then came the day ya started snakin
Found a young brotha ya thought was cute
Chased the donkey on high pursuit
Threw the cak like a ????
Like a wide receiver my man went deep
Just a little deeper than ya man did
And when he was done he left ya butt stranded

Ya love that donkeeeeey (DONKEY)
Ya gotta have that donkeeeeey
Ya love that donkeeeeey (Can't live without it)
You can't live without that donkeeeeey, yeeaaaah
You didn't trip, it was worth it
He made ya orgasm, cum so perfect
Went to the hood and told all his friends
Then the word got back to the penn
And when ya man came home he didn't greet ya
Put on some leather gloves and smooth beat ya
Ya got a black eye and a busted lip
But that nigga got two hollow tips
One to the leg and one to the chest
He mighta lived, if he wore a vest
Now because of you shit got funky
Just because your freaky ass had to have that donkey

Now ya all grown up and ya still a fein
A lady like you ain't nothin clean
Twenty-four hours on a dick prowl
The only difference is ya lick now
Ya learned to fuck, plus get paid
Donkey and money hmmmm ya got it made
Yeeah, some dick in ya cool
Pussy much deeper than the richardson pool
From city to city girl you be lookin
If you really look at it, girl ya hookin
But you ain't trippin, ya rollin the benz
Fresh wardrobe and plenty of ends
And now ya run with all the women
That just gotta have that dick in em
It used to be called the hot chick squad
But now ya called..the get dick squad!
Get dick squad...get dick squad...
Just gotta have donkey in ya cak, in ya cak
Ya gotta have that donkey in ya cak

Ya gotta have that donkey in ya cak girl
Ya don't stop girl, ya don't stop girl
Ya gotta have that donkey in ya cak girl (cak girl...cak girl)

Mike get busy for me one time:
Donkey here and donkey there
Girl ya gettin donkey every where
Fuckin it, teasin it, lickin it, squeezing it
Fuckin till ya get enough

With a big fat spliff and a gang of boolay
To get tipsy or should i say perkt

Jealous mothefuckers wanna keep me at the bottom
Cause funky fresh rhymes you know I got 'em
And jealous fools way older than twenty
Wanna sweat me cause they broke

They don't want to grow up
Shit is making me sick about to throw up

Chuy,Al Boo Boo,2003.0,"Wake the hell up, take your shower
We finna KMEL up for the next four hours
Coffee in the kitchen getting ready for work
Partner don't listen, better your smirk
Can't be yelling for shit, you don't play it you're loco
Especially from seis to ocho
I'm posted in that bumper to bumper
 why don't you play me a slumper
I'm never on time, always late
On the Bay Bridge or the Golden Gate
We're feeling great, and ew-we
Get stewie with the cutty Chuy
Look at that fool in the car with the seat jumping
He must be bumping what we bumping
If Chuy ain't playing, boy it ain't right
It's like a scrape thing without the whistle pipe
Mac Dre and Chuy don't F with them of brands
'Cause Chuy in Quentin on the yard on the Walkman
He the bossman, jerk
One hundred and six point one megahertz
At work everybody loving him
A little (scratch sound) from DJ Double M
I'm ""Stupid Doo Doo Dumb"", gon' grow dreads
And come light one with Chuy Gomez

Hey, go, go, go Chuy

Go Chuy, get stewie

Hold Off,It’s Not What You Say...It’s How You Say It,2001.0,"Now I came here for something hyphy to happen
Is this Christmas? Because everybody's rapping
There's too much yapping, running off at the jaw
When your beats ain't slapping and your rhymes ain't raw
Super bunkola like a bag of stress
You need to sell yola, give the mic a rest
Nigga you ain't fresh, you weak
You sound like a broad and you rap off beat
Nigga back off me, tryna get signed up
You silly rabbit, you need a good wind up
Line up with the rest of the chumps
Cut the crap, come back with some slumps
Ship get sunk, kerplunk
Perp start macking, stop acting drunk
Get low, punk, get on
Who told you, you can rap? Hold on

Hold off
Because you soft
My ninjas get off
Hold off
Because y'all soft
My ninjas get off (Hold on)
Hold off

The shit that you're spittin' ain't really hittin'
You could bail out, have you ever thought to quitting?
All these niggas on these compilations
Everybody rapping all across the nation
He used to be a janitor, now he flow
My nigga played pro ball, now he flow
My nigga dropped out of school, now he flow
But that bullshit he rippin' ain't banging at all
Now 415 was gangster rap
Half Thang

Seasoned Veteran

Plus 
The Game

So me and Mac Dre come to check The Bay
Punk, it ain't what you do but what you say
Sixteen bars, can you hold your weight?
I stole ""Five on It"" and only blew off eight
Nigga, what? Fuck with that

My ninjas get off (Hold on)
Hold off

Hold off

Hold off, MC Never Heard
And you rap like you on crack and a squirter
Don't deserve a, shot or a chance
When you rap, the people don't dance
You's a Gong Show king, you unknown comic
You make the mic smell like vomit
Quit it, will you? (Will ya?)
You're your only fan, they just don't feel you
Mildew, rotten, vanished, forgotten
What the fuck is going on?
Who told you you could rap? Hold on

Hold off

Testin' yea let's do this shit baby
Shit I don't know I can't hear that shit

You know my niggas they control the weight
From the Golden State
I hold your fate in the palm of my hand
Wit this here throw away
I empty out and load the K
The lil' figga wit the gun that's bigger than him
It's kinda hard to hold it straight
But still I knock Louie
Seen shit rip through him
Got stooie wit my killa click
Cop, chop shoot him
Like I'm fresh in the game
Just reppin' my name
Young and in love wit the tec when it flame
You know my name
Shit I was on the block
Wit a freshly chop though
Didn't have spinners
I'm out the bag that's my knock bro
Fresh out the box wit the Glock though
Plus my niggas ridin' tonight
Two of 'em waitin' for that fiend rental to slide through
Then my hustle gon' pause
For this tooly by the muscle in my drawls
Me no tinsel wit y'all
I touch y'all
Half way niggas rookies
And will never touch raw
Buy the crack and watch me bring the applause
Blocka, Blocka!

Mac-matic slanguistics
Break it down in fractions
Every verse a nigga spit is like a commercial for boss mackin'
When it hit the streets you should just see how they re-actin'
Animal attraction
You fiends is relaxin'
Hit it once and back spin
Mac slap the captain
Body bag the boss man
You don't want it to happen
Cutthroat approach
Leavin' t-shirts soaked
Bust shots at your throw back
Leave hoes where the team go

Mackin' to the next level
Highly professional
Street level but high post
Ghetto to ghetto
Boonies to barrios
Cess spot turf

Grimy and greezy
Don't make me leave yo moms weepin'
My nigga J. Klyde will leave 'em where you'll never peep 'em
All my peoples quick to push that line for they seaman

A few years ago when I used to grind
Police used to fuck wit me all the time
A young Codwell banker
A Gunthy Ranker
Strapped wit thump thanker
A cold drunk tanker
Stupid dumb, mentally disturbed
I used to bother people
And get on people nerves
Standin' on the curb
Trynna get it off
I sell it to 'em hard
But I buy it from 'em soft
I'm a felon and a boss
It's funk I spray dude
Dump out the prelude
On them punks and gay dudes
I pay dues
You can't fit Mac Dre shoes
I break laws
And I don't obey rules
I drive wit my L's suspended
Get apprehended
Cop gets commended

Got a fat backwood, car tacked out
Fat four four that'll blow a niggas back out
Squatted real low, dank wood killing me
AC chilling me, but yall ain't feeling me
A Cutthoat pimp, tripping and flashing
Dipping and dashing, I'm sick when I'm smashing

Pay bitch if you really want to stay bitch

I bring fire, retire (?) wannabe killas
Can't fuck with, now who you be, I be that nigga
Steady ready to snatch it ticket wicked with a fashion
Tough as Tinactin, that bend tricks with a fastness
Dipping and dashing, four door Chevy smashing
Representing that raw shit, to your jaw shit
We be flawless, putting paper over all this
But yall just, niggas up in the way up on some garbage
That jargon, that make a nigga empty every cartridge
Walking target, make you park it where you start it

Two hundred dollars worth of smell (?) they slipping him
Quarters zippers on my (?) if its twelve I'm hitting him
Long or (?) green weed stall my lids and a Cutthoat is all I'm is

Suck a dick if you can't fuck hoe, swallow the kids

Check the formats, lay suckas down like floor mats
Those who approach get pulled like stagecoaches, we floor cats
Turned up with no blood lets make it official
These squares play the front
We in the back highly sparked off scud missiles
Sip on fosters slowly, hoes drop they panties just to know me
And show me, when the five hundred post, bitches kick it like shinobi
Plenty fuck trophies; I rock a bitch like a rollie
Give her two dubs nigga tell her bring me back 40
Scum of the slum, call the bitch names
Separate the busters from the thugs, floss it in there face

Layin’ it down for the town, big parties we host
Up in the West Coast, left side of the map
That’s why them bitches be so sprung on the way that we rap
You see I tap that ass constantly
And treat her like the tramp that she wants to be
I break a hoe, shake a hoe, you ready or not? And leave a…
(Mac Dre: Muthafuckin’ cloud in the parking lot)
I got the front and back and side to side
And four fifteens in the back of the ride
I got the windows up but the brains is blown
And about this pimpin’ type shit I can’t leave it alone
I needs a microphone, some Tanqueray
And a down ass bitch who likes to do what I say
‘Cause in the Bay, that’s how we layin’ this
I’m probably gettin’ a little head while you playin’ this

And now I’m in a coke white Caddy with rims
I got tapes and CDs that wears your jewel
I’m from the 707, cover 11 my roll
Premeditated pimp in the Westside and it’s evident
The way I spit, talk shit and stack a president
Ooh, I’m out to bend a corner or two
Gotta watch my bubble flow
And tramp hoes don’t come short
So call me fiero, I’m out hustlin’ for dinero
Gotta watch my back ‘cause playa haters packin’ heavy metal
And I can't settle for less, I need is platinum, hoe

Get tremendous beat, fresh V’s and say ‘fuck it’
The B-A-Y A-R-E-A
Where niggas smoke dank and drank all day
We words like skrilla, scratch and fetti
Give hoes pimp names like Blowjob Betty
No homies and locs, just potnas and folks
No lifts and switches, just dips and yolks
We swang ‘em in ‘Stang’ems and burn rubber sideways
Gat on the lap when we hit the highways
On Fridays, we down to hurt some cot
And we don’t get drunk, mayne, we perks a lot
We call bud dank, Bombay and roper
Don’t smoke stress ‘cause stress won’t choke ya
I hope ya, never have funk with us
‘Cause niggas from the Bay love that funky stuff
Pistols, pumps, straps and choppas
And wouldn’t hesitate or wait to straight knock ya

Rule, Number 2: smoke all the weed and always fuck somethin’ new
I like my big green like Bruce Banner

Had the blunt in the rug, a hoe in the tub

Feeling Like That Ni**A,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Chillin At A House Party Me And My 40
Chokin Of Dank Rolled Up In The Paroty
Cock Everywhere I Mean The Bitches Was At That
I'm Peeping The Scene Seeing Who I'm a Mac At
This bitch walked in lookin real prizznity
With No Hesitation I Step To The Brizznity
Said How U Doin Baby Can I Spit At U?
Saucey Young Tender Can I Get At U?
She Must Of Recognize Point Pimpin On Site
Cause She Was Jocking Md For The Rest Of The Night
We Smoked Dank And Drank Tangerey I Said Baby R U Sure U Can Hang With Dre?
With The Party Still Poppin We Shook The Spot
Cut To My Room And I Took The Cock
For 25 Mins Md Was Shoving it
And She Was Screaming My Name And I Can Tell She Was Lovin It
Cock Was Thrusted
Nutz Was Busted
In This No Good Bitch That Some Nigga Trusted
Pulled Up My Pants And She Put On Some Lipstick
Went Back In The Party Feeling Pimperistic
I Could'ntHelp But Notice That This Nigga Was Stairng
I Thought He Was Trippin Off The Clothes I Was Wearing
But He Stepped To Md And Said Was Up Punk U Been Fuckin My Bitch And Now I Want Some Fun
I Said I'm Not With The Drama So U Can Save The Theatrical
I Macked On Your Bitch Cause She Appeared To Be Mackable
But Instead Of This Nigga Being Real On A Playa
He Took A Step Back And Tried To Steal On A Playa
I Said Look Fool Nobody Smashes Dre
I Though These Things Like Young Cassius Clay
With One Blow I Sent The Punk To The Floor
And Said Get Your Ass Up If U Want Some More
These Niggas Ran Up They Must Of Been His Crew
Now Tell Me What The Fuck Was I Supposed To Do
Cut To The Room And Got The M Double A
So I Can Get These Muthafuckas From Up Out Of My Face
Let Off A Ratatat
Hopped In My Cadillac And Burned Long Rubber On Them Suckaz I Got Outta That
I Got My Choppa On My Left With My Finga On The Trigga
Rollin In A Glass House Feeling Like That Nigga
Suckaz Started Static Last Night Now I'm Searchin
Finen Put Some Work In
Yak Got Me Purkin
Seen This Sucka Posted With His Bitch At The Liquor Store
Put In The Clip And Go
Didn't Mean To Hit The Ho
Fully Automatic Mac 11 Spittin Fast
Make Sure I Get That Ass Then I Hit The Gas
Punch It To The Hood Switchin Up Now I'm Back
Rollin In The Lac Still Sippin Yak
Rollers To Their Right Get Behind Me I Don't Trip
They Lookin For A Nigga In A Chev I Don't Slip
High Speed Chase If The Want To Harrass Me
Put The Lights On Switch Lanes Then Pass Me
Have Me Kinda Noid But No Longer Am I Spooked
And Man Like I Said If They Jacked Me They Was Juked
Creep To The Spot Where The Homeboys Romp
Niggas On The Dice Gettin Paid Shootin Twamps
30 Mins Later Pockets Fat Now I'm Kool
Steppin Out The House Niggas Scream Get That Fool
Suckaz Smash Up In The Duce And The Squirrel
3 Ball Heads And A Nigga With A Curl
Bullets Let Loose I Get It In The Chest
Fools Smash Off creaming Trick Fuck The Crest
Waitin For The Muthafuckin Ambulance
Thinkin To Myself I Don't Stand A Chance
Dizzy And My Breathing Is Impossible

Always Inta Somethin’,It’s Not What You Say...It’s How You Say It,2001.0,"Back in December, or was it November?
It's kind of shady, I can vaguely remember
I was at the Peppermill, popping at the bartender
She made me a drink called uh, Bodybender
That's when a smurf pulled on my shirt
Said (Hey, get off my girl, dog, before you get hurt)
I said, ""Hold on, I don't know what you think
You better back the fuck up and let me order my drink""
He backed the fuck up and did more than you think
He had a AP, not a nine, but it's sort of the same
So now it's one lonely R-o-m-p
I'm all by myself without nobody
Slightly noided, since death, cannot not be voided?
Somebody slammed the do' on the way comin from the toilet
He looked back, then I pulled out my strap
Slapped him it twice but uh, I should've blapped
Cause this other goon nigga started wildin
I pulled out my faulty phone and started dialin
Told my niggas to come on the double
They finna put a nigga on the goon show, bust his bubble
They said yeah, you know we comin
""But damn my nigga, you always into somethin""

Recently, June 4th, released from jail
About to hit the streets like a beast from hell
It's that nigga y'all done heard about, young J. Diggs
Love to play the game and I play big
I see suckers havin money and I gots to have some
You in the double R, I gots to have one
I'm all up in his backdo' like knock-knock-knock
The nigga moved too fast, so I pop-pop-popped
Should've stood still, there would be no firing
But it's a little late, all I'm hearin is sirens
So now I'm in the wind like leaves on trees
I'm in the crowd tryin to blend like d's on v's
I'm sweatin bullets, I'm an ex-con out on parole
What the fuck was I thinkin, I'm out of control
I'm at the Romp House and I'm huffin and puffin
My niggas lookin at me crazy cause I'm always into somethin

Yo, we fuck with heavy guns, fuck around and pump heavy slugs
We drinkin Rémy doin heavy drugs
Nigga, we stay explosive, it's about a quarter to six
Step out the limousine, my wallet's 'bout a quarter inch thick
Nigga, we shittin on em, I pop the three-piece, savage
So many carats up in my ice I could choke a rabbit
Bitches screamin for me but all it took was one dirty look
We hit that nigga with that murder book
Nigga tried to step fast, hit him in the face with a Moët glass
Spilled drink on his bitch, the whole club hit the do' fast
Trunks is poppin, niggas wingin in the parking lot
We keep it gangsta with them choppers out
S-l double, I smell trouble, boy, it's nothin
Keep your peace, muthafucka, I'm always into somethin

Let me tell you somethin 'bout a nigga like me
Never should've been let out the penitentiary
Cause niggas done switched up, I guess they got it mixed up
Now I'm a dust the heater off my shelf and leave em bitched up
Like this one nigga actin like a dumb nigga
S-in on his chest with no vest, yeah, he a dumb nigga
Ain't no love in this thug shit
Now he at the club tryin to hug on my thug bitch
Plus she done gave me the run-down on how this nigga run round
Town speakin on my name, tonight he get gunned down
His bitch about to set him out, open the door and let him out
Caught his ass headed out, Bronc style, dead him out
Never have beef with a nigga who bitch you wanna sleep with
Cowards get devoured on that sweet shit
Hit him with the venom, then bounce with my adrenaline pumpin
Yo nigga always up into somethin",https://genius.com/Mac-dre-always-inta-somethin-lyrics
It Ain’t Funny,The Game is Thick Part 2,2004.0,"Ha ha, it ain’t funny but the money keep us laughin’, y’all
The game is rough like blacktop basketball
Weak niggas fall, you got to keep mashin’, dog
And do it movin’ if you got the people after y’all

It’s the Rydah, the real one
Ya nig, I might steal one
Shots echo through the ghetto
Rip through your buildin’
Just missed your children
Right above the crib
Though you wasn’t so lucky
Somebody love the kid
You shoulda ran and hid, the line had been crossed
The 4-5 and the choppa after the nines had got tossed
Somebody gotta die, if I go, you gots to go
My yayo’s movin’ slow, my K need ammo
It’s the life, I live it, my right to spit it is evident
Bustin’ my gun and it wasn’t for dead presidents
I’m tryna live, fuck all forensics, no evidence
Stalk out his house, we bring the drama to your residence
Don’t be alarmed, bitch, it’s just the M-O-B
Rules to this game we play, it’s either him or me
I gotta get him, shots hit him up every direction
From the Bay to P.O., this how we represent the section

Can ya, can ya move it do it? (Move it do it)
You better (Do it movin’)
Let’s move it do it (You better)

I work hard for the money but I never had a job
I run with the mob, deal, steal and rob
Got chicks with tricks on the World Wide Web
Snow bunnies get money, white girls I said
Fight Furl, ya dead, pick, ya get whacked
My little niggas is mainey, they don’t know how to act
They up at 7 with Cobra and Elevens
In Friendship buildin’ chillin’ more than reverend
Waitin’ for the OK call from up top
Been doin’ it since niggas was doin’ the Uprock
Buckshots, itchy itchy, blah blah, heart stops
Head popped, ooh, some nigga got dropped
Got knocked, got popped, did Fed time
K.O. with one blow, lights out, it’s bedtime
Wake up, make up, with the game, it’s bread time
A killer on the news and front-page headlines",https://genius.com/Mac-dre-it-aint-funny-lyrics
King Nicky’s,Pill Clinton,2007.0,"Backwoods got me congested ain't rested in two days
I'm gettin' paid, been on niggas head like toupées
I'm a thug, cuz, rob the blood out you gays
Cutthoat nigga, bitch, I scam 'em for days
On school days, I blew bays, got ripped and fucked up
In new J's on two-ways I scritched and scratched up
I beat that batch up when I found out she lyin'
Who she think I am, ""Saving Private Ryan""?

I make ya town move just by walking on ya block
Take the keys to ya city but I still pick the lock
Buy a car and a Glock, put the cash in my socks
Put the beat in the trunk so ya hear the shit knock
To hell with the law, the freeway's mines
So is your freak, radios and Alpines
Coke with a little bit of cherry lemon lime
Ya think of me ya think of big money every time
Candy coat shine like the trigger of a nine
Orca was a whale but Pisces is the sign

I got split personalities, I'm bipolar
You might see me with my Italian stallion or my chola
Rap rock and rolla, I'm dope as yola
If you don't pimp her, I might like Dola
I'm riding in a big boat like Noah
With two women of each races, boy, I control her
A hoe, a hoe stable, I'm a mack and I'm ready
No dough, hoe? Debit—that's right I said it

I grip my dollar bills like my Caddy steering wheel
I'm not a chill pill freak, do what you will
Heart ticking like a time bomb eating spicy prawns
Man, it's the god of Khan, check it baby, right or wrong
Man, look but don't stare, it's the crime rhyme king
With braids like a juvenile Khan, nahmean?
Went Bruce Springsteen in my Anchor Blue jeans
Oh yeah, I'm in ya city, man, what's up with the weed?
Man, call all the Gs, and tell 'em all freeze
Andre Nickatina sayin' 'nigga, what you need?'
Hit the corner so narrow in a fly blue Camaro
A sparrow dodge a arrow but not a double barrel

We in a 7 Series Beamer, it's me and Nickatina
Ready to sexual harass a bitch like Martin did Gina
Committin' felonies and hella misdemeanors
A dog in the yard where the grass is hella greener
Rap singer, a pimp done slapped Tina
I mack Nina from Black to Latina
Clean as Noxzema, quick to pop the nina
Got the money from the broad as soon as I seen her
Wilhelmina, Tina and Trina, got dick by the bay on the Berkeley Marina
Don't mean to point the finger but uh
She got pancake, syrup and butter

Man, the way I smoke weed it's like death of a genius
Reappear, roll up, rise like the phoenix
This is not a remix, Nino, Felix
Put it in a capsule, seal it, deal it
How you want it, Nicky baby? Four times five
A quarter ounce of weed and some cherry pie thighs
Excuse me if I'm greedy 'cause I'm caught up in the lust
I'd lie if you want but I'm a tiger you can trust
'Cause I'm on Fillmore in a white velour suit
In a blue Kangol, in my Wu-Tang boots
With a back like a cobra, cursed by the mail
My manicured nails touch a triple-beam scale
Baby is a athlete, body like a star
Ya talking real bad, freak, meet me by the car",https://genius.com/Mac-dre-king-nickys-lyrics
Royal Flush,Pill Clinton,2007.0,"Woke up one mornin 'bout 6 o'clock
Dick still smellin' like spit and cot
Beeper vibratin' like a nympho sex toy
It's time to collect, them hoes got they checks, boy
But on my way out the motel room
The bitch said 'Dre, why must you go so soon?'
Thinkin' about the night before and how she licked me
I bounced back in so I could get me a quickie
Dick hard as ten pounds of frozen neckbones
I got my wreck on and got the heck on
Droppin' a ho off, you know I had to show off
I burnt rubber and the bitch tried to go off
But all I did was laugh, like she was a joke
Hit the gas, and left her ass in smoke
Strikin' in my Chevrolet you know I had to smash it
Dippin' and dodgin', makin' my way through traffic
Merrily merrily, merrily merrily I go
Looked in the rearview, damn, it's 5-0
Once again pullin' me over for the jack up
In my mirror I can see him callin' back up
But I ain't goin' out like no sucka
Put the pedal to the metal and smoked the muthafucka
Stopped at the store on Sacramento and Tennessee
Got a pack of zig-zags and a fifth of Hennessy
Perkin' off the dank and the drank connection
It's back to my mission, nigga, bank collection
Back to my mission
Back to my mission
Back to my mission
Back to my mission

Rollin' in my old school Lincoln, drinkin'
Joint between my lips and I'm dankin', sinkin'
Deep in the seat, with the beat on the down-low
But I ain't trippin' on the way it really sound though
I got a down ho, ready to hit the track
And bring back fat stacks of them greenbacks
Hit the stroll but before I let her go
I let her know, she's nothing but my ho
4 was the time on my wristwatch
Grabbed my phone, turned it on, 'cause I just got a motherfuckin
Beep from a freak on another strip
Get the Hennessy and I take me another sip
Call the bitch back and she's ready, to kick down
What she made, from just gettin' dick down
Bounce to the spot where my ho does work
See her in a skirt and a see-through shirt
Pull her off the track and I don't say shit
'Cause all I wanna hear is that purse unzip
Lookin' at the bitch with the pimpish grin
Feelin like The Mack as my ho kicks in
Let the bitch out, start unloadin' my cut
Let the 15's slam and I'm fuckin' em up
They can't understand how I bounce my head
Smokin' on a joint at a light that's red
Niggas can't be me but they wish they could
The light turned green and I hit the hood
See my homeboy Don in a '74
The rollers got him jacked but they lettin' him go
Catch up with him up at the light
And said 'What's up cuddie, where they at tonight'?
He said 'It's goin' on playa at the afterdark
And there's a house party bumpin in College Park'
Playa waved to my homie then I split from the scene
Then it's back to my mission, nigga, gettin' the green
Back to my mission
Back to my mission
Back to my mission

Late one night, I drove my Brougham to the burger spot
Stepped in, all I saw was a herd of cot
Went in my pocket, came out with the yack bottle
Twist the cap then I took me a fat swallow
All I could smell was cock in the air
And I can tell by they stare they was jockin' the playa
Went to the counter, ordered burger and milkshake
The girl standin' behind me was thick with silk fake
Hair that looked the real but she had looks to kill
I stepped back and gave the broad my spill
Told her my name and she couldn't believe that
Kept spittin' game 'til I peelt her weave back
She recognized the playa and she knew I was major
Gave her the number to my Pactel pager
Snatched my grub, then I hopped in my town car
And let them landstars slam, and pound hard
Honked at the hutch when I cut from the scene
Then it's back to my mission, nigga, gettin' the green
Back to my mission
Back to my mission
Back to my mission
Back to my mission",https://genius.com/Mac-dre-royal-flush-lyrics

By a tricycle!
(""That's what I pray for every night."")
And ten more bicycles!
Yeah, erry night
I don't like the bitch
I hate the bitch
Ya know, fuck the bitch

Now before I start rapping, I must warn ya
I just washed down two mushrooms with some orange juice
I was thizzin' when I wrote this, forgive me if it goes astray
It's just one of the many dumb flows of Dre
I'm tryna see G's, play these hoes like CD's
Old school like the Bee Gees
Give me green and some Wheaties
You don't want to see these, I don't give no freebies
Hoe, this dick cost, what you thought I fucked was ten ki's
Remy, it's in me, bring me what you got
Then baby maybe I'll love like my two Glocks
I'm too hot, I do not, fuck with no havers
I'm a Crestside cutthoat, cold toe-tagger
A hoe capturer, then keep 'em in captivity
You ain't know about that niggity, Driggity, M-Diggity?

I mob like Durango, seat tilted lay-low, boy
I bring heat like one hot jalapeño
I mob like Durango, seat tilted lay-low, boy
I bring heat like one hot jalapeño

Smoov with the groove, when I run right thru, and boy I just might pull it
With a all black hat, and a fat bomb sack, bring heat just like a bullet
Got an all new fit and a brand new bitch
To girl, this dick's a no-no
So I picked up a bottle of Captain Morgan's, took her to the mo-mo
I had to hit the cho-cho
Boy, this ain't no hoe stroll
But in my town these girls get clowned like they first name was Bobo
Can't shake E, or break E, stay around like a 12-day hickey
Girl, it's tasty, like Lacey, took it all like a wide-mouth Mickey

I mob like Durango, seat tilted lay-low, boy
I bring heat like one hot jalapeño
I mob like Durango, seat tilted lay-low, boy
I bring heat like one hot jalapeño

This game gets sticky, these hoes get tricky
Ya boy gets picky, ya see I hang with Nicky
And cats like Mac Dre, we dress in khaki
That backup band bass, shows how much this rap pay
We kicks with Mary, Jane and Judy
My piece like Larry 'cause getting ass is my duty
Don't trip or slip, just do my thang
Smoov pimped out like a pinky ring

I mob like Durango, seat tilted lay-low, boy
I bring heat like one hot jalapeño
I mob like Durango, seat tilted lay-low, boy
I bring heat like one hot jalapeño

Something's got ta happen, something's definitely got to happen
I hope she get ran the fuck over
I never did like the bitch, I mean I never liked-ed the bitch
Y'all were the ones hooping an' hollering about the fucked up bitch
Fuck the bitch",https://genius.com/Mac-dre-handcuff-your-bitch-lyrics

See, they got theirs, and y'all got y'alls
And now it's time to get mine and plus I got balls
Pause for a sec as a nigga run a check on this microphone
To see if it's on

Doin' the same ol' thang (Back 2 da basics)
Doin' the same ol' thang (Back, back 2 da basics)
Doin' the same ol' thang (Back, back 2 da basics)
Doin' the same ol' thang

I called a few friends
To see if they could front me some ends
They all talking about 'it depends'
What I need it for—now ain't that strange?
How money make muthafuckas change
And I 'bout had it with this job, choppin' down wood
While my homies choppin' ki's in the hood, livin' good
And I can't stand one more case
Because the judge would throw the book dead in my fuckin' face
That's why everybody's willin' to die
To get a fat piece of the pie
I'm coming up dry, my pockets on chap
I'm thinking about pimpin' the hoods up with the gat
Silly of me, how dumb could I be?
It's time to make a call to the homie MD
Can a nigga get plugged? I hear you got juice
And I got a few albums I'd like to produce
Don't sweat the style, 'cause I got flow
That why I called your ass to let you know

Doin' the same ol' thang (Back 2 da basics)
Doin' the same ol' thang (Back, back 2 da basics)
Doin' the same ol' thang (Back, back 2 da basics)
Doin' the same ol' thang

Now, everything's fine, no more grind
The feds can't stick me with no more time
I told my boss that he can kiss my black ass
'Cause being on his team no longer gon' last
I make my rounds, through the Jordan Downs
Then off to the Crest, hittin' zest by the pounds
No more set trippin' unless you wanna trip
With my cess, smoke your ass like a Vietnam vet
I bet I'll go far if I pursue to be a star
Eatin' chitlins and ham, and I could give a damn
'Bout Uncle Sam, 'cause my army's getting paid
Hittin' them with them lyrics that they know they can't fade
So I stop, scheming up a mission to plot
Avoiding three hots and a cot
I gotta give a shout to my niggas in the pen
'Cause without your help, I wouldn't have no win
Gave an end to my moms and I drop the bombs
And just like the homeboy Wams, I'm Back 2 da basics

Doin' the same ol' thang (Back 2 da basics)
Doin' the same ol' thang (Back, back 2 da basics)
Doin' the same ol' thang (Back, back 2 da basics)
Doin' the same ol' thang (Back, back 2 da basics)
Doin' the same ol' thang (Back 2 da basics)
Doin' the same ol' thang (Back, back 2 da basics)
Doin' the same ol' thang (Back 2 da basics)
Doin' the same ol' thang (Back, back 2 da basics)

Doin' the same old thing, oh

It's mackin in the throw back starter
Mustin in mayo on tha yayo white nada
Eric estrada on the bike tryna tackle me
Hit a quick right then I dip into applebees

Nah I'm just playin can a nigga get a dub out ya
I'm a club hoppa catch me in the parkin lot

If you really want me baby give it up
Give it up
Give a fuck
I'm a drunk and an alchy
I need life insurance cause she sucked the life out me

We S-T-U-P-I-D
When we goto the club we don't need id
Everywhere we go it's a party ya'll
We gon get it crackin like the mardi gras

Maan even back when I was a 20 sack buya
I was el flamo partna I had fire
Bumpin like a bad choir
Hutches used to ADmire
Tha way I rocked tha mic on that bombay saphirre
Down like a flat tire
Heated like a flat iron
Had a benz and a lexus but not a jaguar
Cutty I slap fire
When they talk back
Oh this watch and the chain
The hutch bought that
Mac dre fought back
For position
In this rap game I was really on a mission
From reno to richmond
My teams known for pimpin
Decon the poison
And kilo the henchman

Icy fools in Nike shoes

Tell me you a baller but you ain't got a team

You can't play me with ya old Mercedes
Gotta give something for the grown man gravy
Hazy baby come with cabbage
Three new broads is a weekly average
A young mac know the dick to the purse
Hit it from the back
Climbing in reverse
She had high socks and skirt like a nurse
She wasn't that fine but it sure gets worse

’93,Back N Da Hood (2005),UnKnown,"’92, nuthin’ nice, I thought you knew
Brothers gettin’ smoked, it ain’t no joke
But I got a little something for that
Check it out “That’s right”
1, 2 “Mac muthafuckin’ Dre”

Murder rate is up but still don’t give a fuck
It’s all about stacks and making a fast buck
Black man, often common reality
Cops getting away with police brutality
Everywhere I go it’s the same old thing
Brothers on the block slanging with cocaine
Can’t get a job ‘cause the boss is prejudiced
How come everybody is so damn negative?
Jail cells packed to full capacity
Punk police keep steady harassing me
Babies having babies addicted to blow
Brothers started jacking for shit, that’s low
Kids steady taking big guns to school
Thinking that shit is all fun and cool
But kids keep dying from ruthless crimes
I guess we’re just going through ruthless times
’92 really wasn’t shit to me
I wonder what happens in ‘93

“Yeah though” ’93…I wonder what happens in ‘93
“Yeah though” ’93…I wonder what happens in ‘93
“Yeah though” ’93…I wonder what happens in ‘93
“Yeah though” “Getting crazy”…I wonder what happens in ‘93

’92, year of the homicide
Fathers, daughters, sons and mamas died
9 millimeters became essential
And learning how to use them was fundamental
Brothers sold rock on the block they slayed hard
One-way ticket for a trip to the graveyard
Muthafuckas have no time to fight
Shoot ‘em up quick sideways to the next light
Brothers nowadays have so much anger
Mama’s little boy is now a stranger
Never woulda thought he’d be a ruthless villain
Killing muthafuckas, straight robbin’ and stealin’
But that’s how it goes, and all he knows
Is talk these hoes up out they clothes
It’s all about green, money reigns supreme
Young black brothas try to chase that dream
Living all in tidy bowl, no one excited though
That’s the way it is, it just ain’t right though
’92 really wasn’t shit to me
I wonder what happens in ‘93

“Yeah though” ’93…’93…I wonder what happens in ‘93
“Yeah though” ’93…’93…I wonder what happens in ‘93
“Yeah though” ’93…What’s gonna happen in ’93?
“Yeah though” “Getting crazy”…I wonder what happens in ‘93

What’s gonna happen in ’93?
Another white president lying to me
Talking some shit about a minimum wage
Fuck that shit, I’m finna get paid
Slangin’ this dope through a microphone
And never would I ever leave the mic alone
If I wasn’t rappin’, what would probably happen
I’d be cuttin’ down ounces, straight stackin’
It’s a damn shame but it’s oh so real
But instead of selling coke, dope raps I deal
But for most young brothers it ain’t that easy
Times are rough, and life is sleazy
Living on the track tryin’ to make that mail
Shooting them dice waiting for that sale
In ’93, will things get worse?
How many brothers will ride in a hearse?
’92 really wasn’t shit to me
I hope it gets better in ‘93

“Mac Dre” ’93…I hope it gets better in ‘93
“Mac Dre” ’93…’93…Will things get better in ’93?
“Mac Dre” ’93…’93…I hope it gets better in ‘93
“Mac Dre” ‘93…I hope it gets better in ‘93
“Yeah though”
Yeah, Mac Dre, locked down in ‘92
But I’ll be free in ’93, yeah
In the Fresno jail, I ain’t stressin’
Straight progressin’, you know “Yeah though”
Brothers gotta get their game tight…

Do you wanna come up in ’93?
Gotta stack a big bank ‘cause you want a big thing
Brothers ain’t  jacking every day and every night
‘Cause a muthafucka just wanna live life right
Don’t trip, mayne; young brother, don’t trip, mayne
Don’t trip, mayne; young brother, don’t trip, mayne
I wanna say one more thing before I go
“Getting crazy” “Crestside”
Yeah, much love, mayne; I send much love, mayne
“Much love” I’ll work on that; I’ll work on that
Young and black
And the beat don’t stop (Beat don’t stop)

Like 
I'm a vato
Every word I'm rhyming bitch
It's hard to swallow
I'm a model, desperado
I got bitches in Novato
All the way to Colorado
Instructions they follow
I'm ricky ricardo
When I say it Lucy do it
She bit it, and chew it
I want nothing to do with
Most bitches cause most bitches is broke bitches
I yoke bitches with no witness
My four-fifth is
My close pal I'm so wild
I show wild get smoked out
I blow clouds of dopechild
I'm mean for the ends and got ice in my my ring
I got screens in the benz before the licesnse plate came
Might with a sexy in strange motel
It's Thizzelle
And yes he in a Range rovelle
I'm like cocaine for sale, I'm cooked
Get your hook
I'm the dope 

I'm cooler than cool
I'm ice cold
Slid on my watch and it stopped
Becasue time froze
Like heron in your nose
Just wait till niggas doze off and sleep
Now the hoes tryin to creep
Throwin there cloths off in the G
I pulled off and see some hutches on the corner
But just be
Cause it's buisiness as usal
Eat, p, and d
But it's MD and me
Drinkin and drivin the G, 5 double 0
Who you know that's flyer than we?
And we ain't tryin to be
It natural like the tobacco from the backwood
I dumped out right before I rolled a sack full of that piss
So much purple, man I been missin that bitch
Wrapped her up and lit her up and we kissed
Grabed the privilage gave my cap a twist
Turned the bitch out just like turning coke to crack is just
All in the wrist and the chain

I was playin

It ain't a game",https://genius.com/Mac-dre-g500-lyrics
Back 2 my mission,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Yeah
I feel ya
I don't know what to say
That's how it's going down?
Woke up one mornin 'bout 6 o'clock
Dick still smellin' like spit n cock
Beeper vibratin' like a nympho sex toy
It's time to collect, them hoes got they checks boy
But on my way out the motel room the bitch said
'Dre, why must you go so soon'?
Thinkin' about the night before and how she licked me
I bounced back in so I could get me a quicky
Dick hard as ten pounds of frozen neckbones
I got my wreck on and got the heck on
Droppin' a hoe off, you know I had to show off
I burnt rubber and the bitch tried to go off
But all I did was laugh, like she was a joke
Hit the gas, and left her ass in smoke
Strikin' in my Chevrolet you know I had to smash it
Dippin' and dodgin', makin' my way through traffic
Marily marily, marily marily i go
Looked in the rearview, damn
It's 5-0
Once again pullin' me over for the jack up
In my mirror I can see him callin' back up
But I ain't goin' out like no sucka
Put the pedal to the metal and smoked the mothafucka
Stopped at the store on Sacramento and Tennessee
Got a pack of zig-zags and a fifth of hennessy
Percin' off the dank and the drank connection
It's back to my mission nigga, bank collection
Back to my mission
Back to my mission
Back to my mission
Rollin' in my old school Lincoln, drinkin'
Joint between my lips and dankin', sinkin'
Deep in the seat, with the beat on the down-low
But I ain't trippin' on the way it really sound though
I got down ho, ready to hit the track
And bring back fat stack of them greenbacks
Hit the stroll but before i let her go
I let her know, she's nothing but my ho
4 was the time on my wristwatch
Grabbed the phone, turned it on, cause i just got
A motherfuckin' beep from a freak on another strip
Get the hennessy and I take me another sip
Call the bitch back and she's ready, to kick down
What she made, from just gettin' dick down
Bounce to the spot where my hoe does work
See her in a skirt and a see-through shirt
Pull her off the track and I don't say shit
'Cause all I wanna hear is that purse unzip
Lookin' at the bitch with the pimpish grin
Feelin like the mac as my hoe kicks in
Let the bitch out, start unloadin' my cut
Let the 15's slam and I'm fuckin em up
They can't understand how I bounce my head
Smokin' on a joint at a light that's red
Niggas can't be me but they wish they could
The light turned green and I hit the hood
See my homeboy Don in a '74
The rollers got him jacked but they lettin' him go
Catch up with him at the light
Said 'what's up cuddie, party at tonight'?
He said 'it's goin on playa at the afterdark
And there's a house party bumpin in college park'
Playa waved to my homie then I split from the scene
It's back to my mission nigga, gettin' the green
Back to my mission
Back to my mission
Late one night, I drove my Brome to the burger spot
Stepped in all I saw was a herd of cock
Went in my pocket, came out with the yack bottle
Twist the cap then I took me a fat swallow
All I could smell was cock in the air
And I can tell by they stare they was jockin' the playa
Went to the counter ordered burger and milkshake
The girl standin' behind me was thick with silk fake
Hair that looked the real but she had looks to kill
I Stepped back and gave the broad my spill
Told her my name and she couldn't believe it
Kept spittin' game til I peelt her weave back
She recognized the playa and she knew I was major
Gave her the number to my Pactel pager
Snatched my grub, then I hopped in my town car
And let them landstars slam, and pound hard
Honked at the hutch when I cut from the scene
Then it's back to my mission nigga
Gettin' the green
Back to my mission

It Don’t Stop,The Rompalation Vol. 2 Mac Dre Serves You an Overdose ,UnKnown,"Verse One: (Free Throw)
Well let me introduce myself
A young go getter mind locked on havin' wealth
Livin' wild with this thug style, I got these hoes
Tuggin' all on my Avirex clothes
A young brown Mafioso, I put my foot through the door
Infrared light smilin' title, desert eagle 4-4
Layin' Cubans on the floor
I send my ghetto troopers to the mother load
To snatch a bottle of A-1 yo
I'm hearin' rapid fire through the house
Eternal warfare with heavy weaponry
Me and my soldiers ain't scared
You get a bullet to the head in trainin' if you don't aim for the head
So I know my young shooters left somebody dead around the corner
Plus got the yola out the trunk bendin' over
Its daytime I can't wait till it turns to night
Cause that's the time when ghetto stars come out and shine
Verse Two: (D-Milli)
Quicker than outlaws I draw on haters with Glocks and techs
Buckin' at undercover agents dippin' off quick in the lex
That's my trigger finger fuck 'em lets bring the heat to the street
Gave him one to the head and there he dead eternally asleep
Deep in this cold world where there's no love, what the fuck should I do?
People be killin' they family for yola not trustin' in you
But now I'm teachin' you some ackrite
With forty-fives and flashlights
Fuckin' around with thug niggas
And drug dealers
Manajetuahs and jaguars getting chopped in the drop
Killin' haters that act hard nigga like it or not
Cause it's a hold up, your hands go up real slow
Should've told ya that I'm a soldier who kills hoes
Pullin' no mercy on these busters ain't no callin' the cops
And my nine is comin' to fuck you nigga ballin' or not
Verse Three: (Dubee)
I'm off in this shit like Mr. Hanky, Janky, but when it gets stanky
Time to rape fiends, my niggas take G's, make G's, but it ain't free
Pimp niggas laced me when I was a baby, how to slang D
And stained me, a suck ya up nigga lip locked but I can't speak
Now it's crazy, niggas be lazy, imbecilic, milli vanillic
Can't speak on it but I feel it, I'm the villain stealin' scrillion
Convo be thrillin' your brain waves get to healin'
Just to reach out and touch you
Train of thought make a killin', Soldiers willin'
So I do it for thug niggas and drug dealers through the snow and rain
Focused on fetti fuck how it came, steady remain
Paper over hoes, and stay on my toes
And air these niggas out like sandals
Blow 'em out like candles
Handle my business and listen to my theezo
And in this thuggin' category I keep it sharp as a needle
Breathe on busters and bust the tech and make it go blah blah
Funkin' with cops and duckin' the law play boy it won't stop",https://genius.com/Mac-dre-it-dont-stop-lyrics

A little hard but a fly young brotha though
Taking you home, baking your dome
It’s like that because I gets my cock on
Spittin’ the game, livin’ up to my name
Some real dope shit but it’s not cocaine
Not the type of guy, the type of nigga
That smokes weed but would never smoke a ciga—
Rette, and I’ll bet, I’ll put a sucker in check
Pop him up then jet, ‘cause that’s what he get
Tryna fuck, with young Mac ass Dre

Nothin’ muthafuckin’ N-I-C-E
Dope rhyme maker, bitch breaker
I could toss a freak, take her money then shake her
Young playa, fly to the park
Not the big pimp, I play the player’s part
You know, maxin’ and relaxin’, catchin’ action
Make a dope rhyme, put it on wax and
Let it hit the street, so you could peep
A dope ass rhyme to a dope ass beat

Fly MC from the big Mac capital
Gettin’ the grit, spittin’ the shit
Making a hit, man, I just can’t quit
Romper Room joker, weed smoker
Don’t smoke joints, boy, I smoke choker
Rap ace, Mac in the place
Biters try to bite and can’t hang with the taste
Of these, fresh beats wit’ a Mac Dre touch
Now tell me am I dope (Pretty much)
And I’m livin’ a Mac’s life

Wanna rock a microphone so fresh
From the Crest, baby, oh yes
It’s the capital D-R-E, baby
From the nikky-nikky-Northside of the V
Down and dirty and nothin’ nice
Catchin’ more cot than a cat catch mice
Not a pimp, but it’s in my blood
I’m a muthafuckin’ Mac from the Country Club
That’s where I kick, get zested and shit
In the CCC is where I stack a grip
‘Cause money come, and money go
But a nigga like me make money grow
Cash and cot is on my mind
And if I’m not thrustin’ I’m on my grind
‘Cause I’m a Mac and that’s how I do it

Hutch’s,Pill Clinton,2002.0,"Y’all call ‘em lushes (Lushes)
We call ‘em winos (Nigga, we call ‘em winos!)
We fuck on hutches (We fuck on hutches)
Y’all suck on them fine hoes (Suckin’ on them fine hoes)

You gotta be careful in this game, nigga (Why is that?)
Cause there’s sharks and hyenas ready for attack
I’m a Mac, like my potna Dre
Been in this game since back in the day
I don’t play, I let the hot ones speak
I ain’t no geek, a drug dealing connoisseur
Came up from the sewer to a high class
Push an S-Class with TVs in the dash
Live the fast life, dodging task and the vice
Get your mind right (Chase them dollars)
Get your grind right (Homie, be a baller)
Get them big faces, do whatever it takes
And stay away from snakes that hibernate in gang
We came, we conquered, the game, we honor
Scrillionaires, not L-7 squares
We Turf Buccaneers (Turf Buccaneers)

We keep it gangsta! (What’s really?)
We keep it gangsta! (Then deal it)
We keep it gangsta! (What’s really?)
We keep it gangsta! (Gots to kill me)
We keep it gangsta! (What’s really?)
We keep it gangsta! (What’s really?)
We keep it gangsta! (Then deal it)
We keep it gangsta! (Gots to kill me)

Living off the fat of the land with my hot hand
Don’t fuck with hot boys, I fuck with firemans
Retire, man, them careers early
It’s Mac Furly, dope as a Felix birdie
I get it dirty, from Hillcrest to Hurley
Tried and tested, respected, I’m sturdy
Do or die, twisted like a ratchet
Blowing blunts down a backstreet with Hachet
See it, we snatch it, heat it, with plastic
MD it, we tragic, and leave ‘em, blasted
Serioso, bigger than oh so
I bring the flames, lame, never come so-so
Loco, nut in the Cougnut
Helping out the Roofie Boo Boo—fool, what?
Let’s get it crackin’, leave the acting for the TV
Believe me, you don’t wanna see me

We keep it gangsta! (What’s really?)
We keep it gangsta! (Then deal it)
We keep it gangsta! (What’s really?)
We keep it gangsta! (Gots to kill me)
We keep it gangsta! (What’s really?)
We keep it gangsta! (What’s really?)
We keep it gangsta! (Then deal it)
We keep it gangsta! (Gots to kill me)

You ain’t heard of C-Lim? Well, that’s ‘cause I don’t fuck with you
While we in a BMW
Fuck it, when your feet up, Cutlass movin’
Through the streets like the undercovers do
I’m out the window, C’d up on your muthafuckin’ crew
Like I give a feenuck about you muthafuckin’ fools
I might squeeze through a couple bars, get my cap on
Ride or die like the Double-R ‘cause I spit fire like Drag-On
‘Cause I’m from the O and you know I’m a crazy fool
With a 4-54 raging bull
I hit the Moe just to kick it with some niggas that’s rough
Then hit the ‘Sco just to kick it with some niggas that bust
Don’t forget the O ‘cause the chickens be hella thick at the butt
Out there, fuck the studio, I’m hittin’ the club
Out there (Just to see) what’s really
(It’s us three) So just bill me

We keep it gangsta! (What’s really?)
We keep it gangsta! (Then deal it)
We keep it gangsta! (What’s really?)
We keep it gangsta! (Gots to kill me)
We keep it gangsta! (What’s really?)
We keep it gangsta! (What’s really?)

Ology,Mac Dammit Man & Friends: City Slickers,UnKnown,"Pimpology, the teachings of a pimp
Get dosed and you'll never beat your weenie again
Stack cheesyology, Mac Dreezyology
Then there's thizzyology for the one's that swallow E
That's T-H-I double Z
I'm a pimp fuck love boy, I'd rather see
A purse full of dough, before I pull a ho
Get this game in her brain than I hit the sto' or stroll
Oh, when I hit the blade
I check a chick for some chips boy, I'm tryin' get paid
Pay Flambé, crap tables and milly made
I'm a king of diamonds boy, you're just a ten of spades
Everything is top shelf, boy I spoil myself
Dough from the ho stroll and flows that I sell
I smell some squares in the air
I'm finna tare, holla at cha
I'll see ya player

It's that turfinology, that
That gangsterology, that
That pimpinology
That's my philosophy
It's that turfinology, that
That gangsterology, that
That pimpinology
That's my philosophy

Turfinology be the teachings of a soldier
Focus so ferocious trying to bubble up like Folgers
I bring hustlinology, my thug philosophy
Be to get all on 'em and smoke 'em
Leaving niggas with knocked knees
I do it like fiber optics
Seeking a spot to lock it
Cock the metal back and pop it
Trying to fill 'em all, four pockets
I gets, all up in 'em
Tougher than denim
Skin 'em, win 'em
I be thuggin' on this mic
New millennium Dolemite
I'm on your back like a jacket
To  for nothing blacking
When choppers get to blapping
Nobody don't know what happened
I get it racking and dome cracking
My middle be dome savage
And business, I'm gon' handle it
Figures I'm gon' snatch it
The ratchet and the machine, nigga
Fuck up the team, nigga
Get tossed and fucked off, fucking with these niggas
When ya speak up on me, the way we breathe on it
You niggas can get it the way you want it

It's that turfinology, that
That gangsterology, that
That pimpinology
That's my philosophy
It's that turfinology, that

Gangsterology that's the teachings of a killer
Relation to the  so you kill them niggas
Murderology, punkinology
Now I'm in some shit, a G I got to be
Cutthoat from the V, it's the 3C down
It's the Crest side crocodile, I bet you niggas know now
Click clack and blap blap, pull it then you die
See I'm a real Crest nigga I'mma multiply
Riding is an art and I mastered it
Blasting with a cannon, slanging caskets, bitch
Jack of all trades, a hand with all aces
Sick in the brain, cash register rapist
The getaway car got the dudes in the gas mask
Blamping with the mac, killing niggas like anthrax
So ask somebody what they know about Reek

Yup
All this shit brand new
So I fuck with it then

My lips is like feet
Jump on the beat like a trampoline
I got heat, nigga, gasoline
A rap group, all in one body
Cutthoat, put a whole clip, all in somebody
I know gradibah, trust her a lil bit
Get sweated by the cops, just for some lil shit
S'finna spill this shit, get it outta me
Come straight for my pulmonary artery
Camaraderie, love for my comrades
They tote tough thangs and they ready for combat
That's right, I'm bad, I'm bad
And you mad 'cause I got the bitch that you had
That's too bad, nigga, step ya' game up
Ice ya chain up, puttin' ya thang up
Run ya gang up, lead 'em off the cliff
Smell that? Nigga, get a whiff

Ice ya chain up, gather ya gang up
She call me with no doe, I hang up
So sav, do it all when we run around
Hoes know strip down when we come around
We make chips off this gift that we cursed with
Every time we do it, we do it with a purpose
Whatchu mad at, man, I'm a class act
Count stacks while I hit baby from the back

No need to get meaner
Oscar my Weiner
Yeah, 'em was tight
But she coulda came cleaner
I don't play, nigga, I'm Mac Dre
I drop two albums on one day
I'll pop two niggas with one K
I'll knock two bitches and they won't stray
You ok? Lame, I'm the man
I know this game like the back of my hand
I call a grand an Iraqi soldier
Never sober and don't get pulled over
From October to the end of September
I touch more mail than a return to sender
Stamp, my camp is nothin' but mean men
Ballers, shotcallers and kingpins
I'm nutty, dummy, trippy and psycho
And I just saved money switching to Geico

Ice ya chain up, gather ya gang up

Count stacks while I hit baby from the back

A base with me, guaranteed three G's
You get the playa price if you fuckin' with E.B
My old school nigga, we was fuckin' with T.B
When I was just a boy in the hood like Eazy
But now I put that boy in the hood like Jeezy
I'm pimpin' ya breezy, bought me a G.T. on G.P
Still, nigga bang out them CD's
Niggas know I was real before they watch Treal T.V
Catch me over the stove
Turn a cola to O's
All day I'll make it snow like the Poconos
We can blaze up the pipe or snort it up your nose
We got it sewed, the S.O. to the Valley Jo's
Roll the six fever, o'beamer
With that four-four heater
Yuk stuntin' like coat zebras
All them stop and goes
Ready to lock and load
All my life my niggas ghost walk the load

I told 'em, yes I am
Ambit of the mothafuckin' man
I'm right there in my D-boy steed
Hip to hands, turn bricks to grams
So sav, do it all when I run around
Fuck with wizzle, BRRRAA, how the gunna sound
We gon' stunt it out
Dipped in butter now
So when I run her down, show off from the gutter pal
Nigga, now, bitch, what's what, get me
From Yuk and a bitch to bump, yup
I'm Buddy Love, ain't no Mr. Klump
Boy, I'll whip the snuff and move zips to bumps

I pops it boy, I pops it big

It all started off with the doctor telling my momma push
On that night in 1-9-7-0 mac dre hopped outhtat puss
I've been soaking game since rock 'em sock 'em and hot wheels
Not never the chance to pass me I keep 'em jocking, I got skills
And when I'm on the mic, styles I got so many
Drink privilege hennessy when I ain't fuckin' with brehmi
M-A-C-D-R-E, that's me
Like 'em freaky like Janet not Jackson but Jackme, whee
To all my niggas in Atlanta to Alabama
Rodreego blowin' only homie, don't fuck with bama
I planned to have a ticket and kick it in the bahamas
Watch your hutch and don't trust your baby momma
Cause I will get your scrill when I kill all in them guts
Don't give a fuck when you give a crippled crab a crutch
But they respect it if not they get rejected
I'm M-D the MC that's not to be corrected

???????
, uno, dos, cuatro
I'm sicker than ten j-cats that be gone off that vato
Most sexual intelectuall with at least 6 figures before the decimal
Warm, hot, and respectable
 but I'm nothing correctable

I fucks with high rollers, shake highway patrollers
Quick to pop the trunk but will come from the shoulders
Got a cuddie named Dubee, he spit more raps than loogies
And when he hand it to me I'm funky like him to me
Baby do me is all them hutches holler
I was breakin' bitches when phantom tops was on granada
More game than keno, down to trips to reno
Sippin' cappachino with Natalia Shapino
C-note stacka' pack a P-89
Love group sex take 'em three at a time
And boy I be out of line when I'm full that tangerey
Quick to grab the chopper, cock, aim and spray
Urban guerilla warfare extraordinare
You know a bout my maccing but boy I'm more than a player
Resurrected double R elected
Haters get ejected I'm nothing to be corrected


Pistol packin' player, gangsta mac for real
About my scrill got to pay my bills
Boy I'm in it to win it if you weak and timid
Better watch how you spend I take yalls like timmy
Busting out like tities in a bra that's too small
Grew up off too short stackin' scrill too tall
Max Drizzay, all damn dizzay
I keep hoes dizzay in a one time busay(busy)
Been rappin' before they called mac mall Brehmis
Rompin' peace Mike Robinson son of Dennis
I'm in this to deep like Tim, Jim, and Johnny
Much love for my cuddies Jay, Ray, and Ronny

I'm from the Cartel, the real Tony Montana's
We put drums and bananas on iz reals
Hood nut niggas thizzin' on E pills
I could see the nigga had bitch in him
So I let the 50 cal blaow get with him

I keep it real, I don't rap about fake shit
This California, mayne, we draw down and take shit

Hop out the Cougnut, change over, to the Range Rover
Mouth full of diamonds, spitting, like a flame thrower
I ain't sober, I'm ripped, tilted
Had a fifth of Remy, but nigga, I killed it
Damn near spilled it on my Enyce clothes
It's the Cutthoat Committee, punk, we play hoes
20-inch'd up, wood grain, leather
Strap, riding, with an Eagle from the Desert
It's the Mac almighty, Andre Hicks
And ain't a punk rock bitch that I can't get
And nigga, I can't trip off nathan but my scrill

Won't tell you check yourself cause I got it
A tested method to get a bitch back in pocket
See one of my my breezys start to bumpin' them gums
A mac black out, and get to goin' on one

Lets split this bitch wig because she much too dumb

Boatin' that '73 Chevrolet burnin' rubberrrr
Like my nigga, Rich the Fact
Nigga it's the Mac in the back of the 'Lac
Soakin' tact, big indo many clouds of smoke
Make old school dance when I dip and yoke
It's like M-A-C D-R-E
Way up in KC with the boy Arby
Yeah biatch, it's presidential
On the under chronic comin' through in a rental
I'm undetected, I come protected
Two 4-4 pistols, a mask and vest biatch
Down and dirty, the cuddies call me Curty
From Mark and Leonard to Howard Hurty?
From Missouri don't worry we keep it ragooey
MD and Luni, from Sac to the Boonies
We gangsta niggas ready for some tension
Fool we ain't trippin' we tryin' to keep it pimpin'
Pimpin' what does it mean?
Paper in my pocket, hoes on my team
They call me Coleone thug real McCoy
I'm a rider bout mine cause trust ya boy
Get shit crackin' like eggs in a pan on fry
This do or die lifestyle got my brain on high
I hit the city streets mean mug, chip on my shoulder
Young punks they mug back but ain't no balls in these soldiers
I'm in the Mid-West, KC, N-O-K-C
Every show, every in-store the hoe framed me
Coleone (got game?) Hell yeah by the pound
Niggas hate (On my name)
Cause they hoes crack smiles (What a shame)
Pimp nigga how ya do that there
Talk a bitch up out her check book and the weave in her hair
I bust rap cats in lips on a square ass nigga
Getting grub in an old school with a dent in the fender
Me and Mac Dre bitch stayin' on our toes
What, what, what, what they call me Coleone!
We gangsta niggas ready for some tension
Fool we ain't trippin' we tryin' to keep it pimpin'
Pimpin' what does it mean?

Don't make us get the bury body shovel
We vicious, dumpin' bodies in ditches
And runnin pimp game on these punk ass bitches
Yeah, I'm the mack of the year like placa bitch
My guys they drive by with the best of the clip
Coleone, young creeper flippin shit like chitlins

We dog niggas, straight hog niggas
Well connected and when we call niggas
It goes down, down, bodies bein' found
Gangsta mack shit that's how we clown
And we down, like 4 flex on a f*cked up hoopty
Big bread and get big head from a fine ass hoochie
They call me, nah f*ck it can't waste my time
Nuts hangin like cellulite on yo' grandma's thighs

When they run up in my house and come out empty handed
Uhh, they can’t touch Dre
‘Cause I’m a cold Crest creeper makin’ much pay

Got an extra 45 days, got caught with a half a tamp
Too Hard for the Radio poundin’ in Chevy Novas

What’s Really Goin’ On was the name of the song, hoe
The California Livin’ got me On My Toes
I’m Y-double-B out the family tree of them Crest Macs

We down like four flats, some call 'em my folks, black
Me and my potent crew is tighter than toes in shoes
There's only a chosen few that I might be closer to
We share clothes, hoes and never with closed doors
On folks disclose 'cause close folks'll sure roll
My potnas will lie for me, take that dive for me
My woman'll cry for me but they kill and die for me
We all from the same track, and all used to slang crack
We all got game fat and scrilla remain stacked
My folks is road dogs like Caine and O-Dog
Some others is so-called, friends but go and dog
So I shake the fake, with faith, I stay true
'Cause me and my folks that's close is way cool

Whenever I'm doin' bad, my folks'll gimme cash
Look out for a nigga fast, and man, when it's time to blast
There's never no compromise whenever the drama flies
We makin' some mamas cry, 'cause it's gon' be homicide
So suckas they stay back 'cause they know we stay strapped
And man we go way back like Murray's and wave caps
I've known 'em for hella years, they just like my relatives
And that's what we tell our kids so this'll forever live
My folks is dedicated, ghetto educated
Some people really hate it 'cause they know we can't be faded
We just like the Wu-Tang whenever we do thangs
It's always a crew thang 'cause that's how the crew swang
So if you ain't knowin' me, my folks is royalty
And all that they owin' me is love and loyalty

(“Money-makin’, hoochie-sinkin’ Crestside playa”)

I roll a ’73 Chevy Caprice
Straight stocked out hubcaps and elites
A four-door mob shot, that’s what I got
Burn a little rubber on a punk ass sahob
A fat ass fleet that’s pumpin’ the beat
A Zapco board to make things complete
I ride and side, whip and dip
Spotted in the seat with a joint on my lip
Ready to take the cops on a high-speed chase
Put up your pink slip ‘cause I’m ready to race
Man, I’m so tight, I just blow right
Past a muthafucka and yes his hoe might
Flag me down the next time she see me
But flaggin’ down Dre ain’t that easy
Steady lookin’ out for the black-and-white ones
So I can hit the gas, swing some tight ones
In my mob shot Chevrolet, I roll every day
And bullshit tapes I’ll never play
I bump $hort and Spice, and MC Pooh
That gangsta shit, I thought you knew
Man, I’m so cool, in my old school
Steady pullin’ bitches when I hit the high school
Short and tall, light and heavy
They all wanna ride in my Chevy

If I rock it then I juk it

He's supposed to, he's supposed to take the, the money, right, take the ho, take the ho, you know that and take the car and get the fuck outta there

Man I found this badass bitch
 she had 
Super you know what I mean?
Check it out

I met this hizzo at a shizzo
Dope from head to tizzo
 come and talk to me, said she's good to gizzo
I asked the broad her name, served her with some game
She couldn't cope with the dope, man I fucked her brain
We talked for a while and she couldn't stop smilin'
I took her to the bizzar and bought her a Long Island
The girl got to perkin', her mouthpiece started workin'
She talked about her lovelife, and how her  was hurtin'
I knew this was the cue, what else was I to do?
I paid for the drinks and cut out on my crew
Took her to my limo, fired up some indo
She told me she was hot, so I rolled down the window
She rolled it right back up, I asked her what was up
She said ""When I said hot, that meant I'm ready to fuck""
She licked my ear, started kissin' my chest
Slurpin' and slidin' some mo' crazy mess
When she got to my dick, I was ready to pop
I said ""If you don't drink 'em, girl, you better stop""
But, she kept blowin' and all she saw
Was fifty million babies swimmin' on her jaw
She was  my dick  it up
Stopped suckin', started fuckin', we was tossin' it up
Nastier than a damn pornographic
I was liftin' her up like a gymnastic
I busted one, two, three, four, five
Man, the pussy was all the way live
When I got off the cock, I fired up the doja
Said ""Damn baby, your cock is kosher""
Your cock is kosher
Yeah, I love a ho with some good ass pussy man (And the beat don't stop)
