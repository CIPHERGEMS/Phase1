Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh
Uh-uh, uh-uh, ahhh

Get the fuck up
Simon says, ""Get the fuck up""
Throw your hands in the sky (Buh-buh-buh-buh-buh!)
Queens is in the back sipping 'gnac, y'all, what's up?
Girls, rub on your titties (Yeah!)
Yeah, I said it, rub on your titties
New York City gritty committee pity the fool
That act shitty in the midst of the calm, the witty

Y'all know the name
Pharoahe fuckin' Monch, ain't a damn thing changed
You all up in ya Range and shit, inebriated
Strayed from your original plan, you deviated
I alleviated the pain with long-term goals
Took my underground loot, without the gold
You sold platinum 'round the world, I sold wood in the hood
But when I'm in the street and shit, it's all good
I'm soon to motivate a room, control the game like Tomb Raider
Rock, clock dollars, flip tips like a waiter
Block shots, style's greater, let my lyrics anoint
If you holding up the wall, then you missin' the point

Get the fuck up
Simon says, ""Get the fuck up""
Put your hands to the sky (Buh-buh-buh-buh-buh!)
Brooklyn in the back shooting craps now, what's up?
Girlies, rub on your titties (Yeah!)
Yeah, fuck it, I said rub on your titties
New York City gritty committee pity the fool
That act shitty in the midst of the calm, the witty

Yo, where you at? Uptown, let me see 'em
Notorious for the six-fives and the BMs
Heads give you beef, you put 'em in the mausoleum
And shit don't stop pumping 'til after 12pm
Uh, ignorant minds—I free 'em
If you tired of the same old everyday you will agree—
I'm the most obligated, hard and R-rated
Slated to be the best, I must confess—the star made it
Some might even say this song is sexist-es
'Cause I asked the girls to rub on their breast-eses
Whether you're riding the train or a Lexus-es
This is for either or Rollies or Timex-eses
Wicked like 
Exorcist
, this is the joint
You holding up the wall then you missing the point

Get the fuck up
Simon says, ""Get the fuck up""
Throw your hands in the sky (Buh-buh-buh-buh-buh!)
The Bronx is in the back shooting craps now, what's up?
Girls rub on your titties (Yeah!)
I said, rub on your titties
New York City gritty committee pity the fool
That act shitty in the midst of the calm, the witty

New Jeruz (Get the fuck up)
Shaolin (Get the fuck up)
Long Isle (Get the fuck up)

Rapid Eye Movement,PTSD: Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,2014.0,"It's not latin, or white, or black music
It's that cooked up coke, crack music
Black Thought and Pharoahe, the rap duet
It's that lucid rapid eye movement

My think tank's like a piranha tank think, multiple bites figure
Mega, reality, tera, giga
Grand Theft Auto, modern day Mickey and Mallory Small
But I'm sick enough to walk into an art gallery and piss on a Picasso
Crack statues, rub my balls on a Banksy shit on it and throw it at you
So when the beat intensifies
I become emotionally desensitized
Like, once I slapped a rapper with mace
Then I spit acid in his face, after he rinsed his eyes, no wait
I actually grew five times my size grabbed Ma$e by the thigh and slapped a rapper with him
Now that's practicing sacrilegious activism
Attack is for battle, and practical rap with wisdom
Actually, it's pragmatic capitalism for actors that crack under pressure and collapse when I get 'em
Monch is medicinal man made medical marijuana
With a phase plasma rifle like I'm searchin' for Sarah Conner
And shorty's got brains, shorty not playin'
From 40 blocks I'm a killa with 40 watt range
With an arrangement of bullets that I've arranged
Encrypted in scriptures specific individual names
That shall remain anonymous
Me and the ammunition's in a relationship that's monogamous
It's like I'm married to the silencer
Until I file for divorce and release my ex-calibers
Do art with your arteries, place that for my adversaries
Push your snap back cap back, cap your capillaries like

It's not latin, or white, or black music
It's that cooked up coke, crack music
Black Thought and Pharoahe, the rap duet
It's that lucid rapid eye movement

Vocally twice as magnifying as ever hearing Chewbacca scream
Through a megaphone with the significance of Dr. King
Philanthropic
Cause I'm trying to see man united without referencing UK soccer teams
My philosophy prophecy
The opposite of Mephistopheles' eye inside an isosceles
Sent to Earth to warn of environmental atrocities, and nobody can copy me
Stop, it's not possible but probable that it's only philosophical mockery, strange
Change copper to gold, switch properties, bang!
Stay on top of the globe, flip monopolies, aim
Take stock in the soul, spit properly

Take stock in the soul, spit properly
That extended clip on my hip sits awkwardly
I'm diabolical, follicle triggers that I cock and squeeze
Sending shots to ancient Greece to pop Socrates
I bear arms like button-downs without the sleeves
Manic depressive and possessive like apostrophes
My psychiatrist waive the doctor fees
When I wave the pistol and say listen, quit watchin' me so I can breathe
National Association for the Advancement
Of drugs for performance enhancement
And it's tough taking so many chances
But I've been a bad seed from the womb, they call me ovary cancer
And I got an ugly heart, although I'm totally handsome
And I take the love of your life and hold her for ransom
And my tactical cam that never stood for any national anthems
Whats hood, I am the actual answer
And I'll prove it
Black attire, rapid fire, rapid eye movement
I'm from a species that is higher, I am not human
Extraterrestrial alien, a monster killer of conscience chillin'
In a barrel of lobster
Ex-Slave, sadomasochist, that gave the massa my ass to kiss
A dyin' breed, I'm the last of this
Black is as miraculous as Jesus of Nazareth
When I vocalize the crowd rise like Lazarus
It's the Rhode Scholar, my coat collar piss off PETA
Your hoes holla, he's on top of the bars
Meet a Mr. Globe Trotter in my Adidas
Pure cheetah, hoppin' out of this exotic European 4 seater
Hollerin' cheeba cheeba like I'm Parkside
Killin' is the dark side
Villain, I'm God, I'm Godzilla
Sometimes I'm Bob Dylan put blood on these tracks, for real
So, God-willin' you'll feel what I'm spillin'
Yeah, I never quit, I'm still syndicatin' up
Me and Pharoahe Monch, did it for the benefit of us
This is straight razor behavior, I never get enough
Get the picture, my militia gettin' ignorant as fuck

Yea, it's suicide murder
Straight from the underground through the fiber optics
Pharoahe, Black Thought, complete the cypher
The movement outlandish

It's not latin, or white, or black music
It's that cooked up coke, crack music
Black Thought and Pharoahe, the rap duet
It's that lucid rapid eye movement",https://genius.com/Pharoahe-monch-rapid-eye-movement-lyrics
Assassins,W.A.R. (We Are Renegades),2011.0,"In 2013,
 the World Government placed sanctions against freethinking individuals in order to force people to adhere to one way of life. An independently funded organization called 
poh pih evas nac ew dna eerf rof cisum gnidaolnwod gnikcuf pots
 hired one hundred assassins to infiltrate the headquarters where files were kept. Of these one hundred, ninety-seven were captured, tortured, and executed. Only three remained. 
The third of which was said to own an arsenal that would rival an entire city's police force.
 The second was rumored was to be able to move throughout space and time. And the first... (One)

Fasten your seat belts for the last of the three assassins on earth
The first flashing her purse with a heat stealth
They call me Jean McCoy, beast in me employed,
 deploy deplorable
Through audible destructive actions, attractive decoy
Then pass to the Troy after I'm passing your life over
He'll deliver it through river Styx, Hades,
 I'm cold, deliberate, ladies
My foes limited, pray me some praise (Whispering)
Stay on your toes, villains, it's Grae and your day's whittling (Hey)
Blistering lines packed in six, stick to spine
Wracked with a sick mind, trapped in thick bitch frame
Drug you with strychnine in nine drinks, you drunk
And it's my kidney, you dick brain, I'm just itching to slit veins
Stitch lines,
 
Rick James, fuck yo' lives, sip brains, bitches
Niggas, kick rocks or kick rhymes,
 
it's to the pain
Liquor-riddled liver, sieve in it, sipping it like Capri Sun
Ignant as ever, she's clever, equivalent be none
A ball breaker, call fakers out with passion
You got the gall, bastard, to brawl with the broad brashest?
The ball's in your court, pass it; but warning, fall faster
Than asses with age slack on the back of a Kardashian
The walls crash in, you all on the floor, gasping
The gas pour in the corridors, racking your jaws, blacking out
Catch Grae backing out the back door, cackling
Still make it back to the bar for last call
(Two)

They ask me why I'm highly regarded, this God body, probably
Monch is a mixture of Marcus Garvey, Miles Davis and Bob Marley (Radical) Never skateboard slang like gnarly,
 
more like:
Weed in my whip on the way to get top like Charles Barkley
You are hardly prepared to spar with a marksman, spark me
I'm Gambit with the ace of spades, a master in archery
Vehicular, particularly the vernacular
Specifically the fit so when I spit it, it's spectacular and accurate
When I attack, I'm more legend than Acura
Flip Bloomberg the bird, bitch,
 
more blood than Blacula
More Crip than cryptic scriptures
Encrypted with backwards vernacular
Plus, sicker than most like Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction
I am that nigga for real, 
per capita
Smacking the next rapper that uses the term 'swag' or thereafter
These three assassins get to ass whipping
Prepare to for a professional ass that can
Shape shift, spit, hollow tip clips, mainly
Sick, ain't he? Mind control
Make you shoot your best friend in the face, Dick Cheney
My life is like a documentary film depicted in black and white
Flick's grainy
 (Geronimo)
I'm on Guantanamo Bay taking pics in a Captain Morgan pose
With my left foot on a pile of detainees, screaming
""We are renegades!""
 
Fuck you, pay me
[Skit: Jean Grae & 
Pharoahe Monch
]
Two. Where the fuck... no. Where the fuck is Three?
I know. I know. He's gonna be here. He gave me his word, trust me
Yeah, but he does this every time
He's gonna be here, trust me
He's gonna ruin this mission for us again
Look, here he comes now
(*car crash*)

I be riding 'round with a stripper-slash-burlesque model
I make it pop like my cock in a Durex condom
I'm a opposite artist, I find irony in going
From being like a stone in the grass to rocking the Garden
The same irony as going from fully automatic in the backyard
To having a whole machine behind me
I take my Australian bitches, show her some other thangs
She know my stroke is deadly so she gave me bloody brain
Don't try to get familiar if I don't feel you in person
I'll flip the script and I'll accidentally kill you on purpose
The bad is what I'm flailing, I got so many furs
PETA gon' paint splash me when they see me
No matter what I'm wearing
Your bitch about to open up, sniff some blow off of my dick
Guess you could say she on my coconuts
I'm on point like Chris Paul
You on point like an Atlantic City hooker that licks balls
I'm 'bout to flip in this bitch like Dominique Dawes
And shut shit down like a car when it stalls
I am the deadliest rapper, you claiming that you flow like water
But really, y'all niggas Evian backwards
Marshall hit the jackpot with this flow that I got
I know when I'm hot, it's my show to stop, holding my crotch
My whip cleaner than Amish men in honest ends
Two dimes with me like I'm a twin, 'cause I'm a ten

Okay... I'm in",https://genius.com/Pharoahe-monch-assassins-lyrics
The Truth,Internal Affairs,1999.0,"Yo, truth had me up against the ropes
Semi-conscious without no boxing skills
Fear of it makes hair on my neck grow like minoxodil
Watching the clock is ill when faced with the truth, parallels Observing amateur video tapes of twenty-one top-notch NYPD cops get ill
Fill their minds not to kill, still some never revealed true feelings
We're speaking on the truth right now in itself is a healing
See the creator created existence and balance
At right angles, unless it was conceived and stated
So whoever shall stray away from right lives wrong
The deliverance of the word ""false"", opposite of truth off course
Sure as my slave name sending
Troy Donald Jamerson paves the path, enabling truth
To stay stable and cling to earth
Sort of similar to the way static electricity sting see
Truth brings light, light refracts off the mirror
Visions of yourself and error could never be clearer
The truth is that you ugly, not on the outside
But in the inside, on the outside you fronting, you lovely
The discovery of these things and all are well hidden
But when you in denial of self, it is forbidden
That's the truth

In due time we will find

Let the truth be told from young souls that become old
From days spent in the jungle, where must one go to find it?
Time is real, we can't rewind it
Out of everybody I met, who told the truth? Time did
We find kids speaking 'cause it's naturally in us
But the false prophets by telling us we born sinners
Venders of hate got me battling my own mind state
At a divine rate, I ain't in this just to rhyme great
See the truth in the thighs of a stripper, the eyes of my nigga
If it's only one, then why should it differ?
So constantly I seek it
Wondering why I gotta drink a six-pack to speak it
Took a picture of the truth and tried to develop it
Had proof, it was only recognized by the intelligent
Took the negative and positive, 'cause niggas got to live
Said I got to give more than I'm given
'Cause truth'll never be heard in religion
After searching the world, on the inside, what was hidden?
It was the truth

Truth, truth, truth, truth, truth, truth
In due time, we will find

Check it, on my neck I still got marks from the nooses
The truth it produces, fear that got niggas on the run like Carl Lewis
The truth is my crew is the smoothest spitters of saliva juices
Like The Roots is, more organic than acoustics
Heavenly, what will set you free and kill you in the same breath
That shit you gotta get off your chest before your death
Unless the way you speak is lighter than a pamphlet
'Cause the truth give the words the weight of a planet, god damn it
I ran with what God planted in my heart and I understand it
To be to bring some light to the dark, breathe some life in this art
This must be the truth (Why?)
'Cause we keep marching on (True)
The truth lay the foundation of what we rocking on (True)
You can't see it if you blind, but we will always prevail (True)
Life is like the open sea, the truth is the wind in our sail
And in the end, our names is on the lips of dying men
If ever crushed to the earth, we always rise again
When the words of lying men sound lush like the sound of a violin
The truth is there, it's just the heart you gotta find it in

You will find, you will find, you will find
You will find, you will find, you will find
You will find",https://genius.com/Pharoahe-monch-the-truth-lyrics
Bad MF,PTSD: Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,2014.0,"Totally intoxicated when he drove across the state line
Rapper gone insane, story on Dateline
Lost his wits, didn't take his meds
When they pulled him over, this is what he said
I'm a Bad MotherFucker man (shut your mouth)
Well we talking about Pharoahe
Mashing in that Aston Martin on the Verrazano Narrows
Greatest of all time in the latest apparel
80's baby, ladies crave me on some Mercedes shit
Go tell your favorite rapper eat a bag of baby dicks
They keep singing the same ol' song
I'm a bring 'em the pain for saying the name wrong
Got me going insane I'ma ask you again

Who put these pussies on top
Putting out that pussy music, call it pussy pop
Playing them pussy games, sucker shit
Fucking around but they don't know just who they fucking wit

I'm a Bad Motherfucker man
Universal, worldwide, you know my circle
Renegade, on the mic I might just murk you
Putting in that work, cause I do work, every verse is a virtue

The best liar told a lie inside a room full of liars
The lie was so exciting that all of the liars admired
When the truth walked in the building every liar retired
Deception was defeated and deceit became deleted
Uh, they mad cause they can't stop me
Cause I said fuck swag I got moxie
Lyrically ecstasy I got that oxy-contin poppin
They can't carbon copy or mock me

Broken Again,PTSD: Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,2014.0,"Gotta move on
Gotta let go
Would've opened my eyes, if I would've known
After all of this time
Took my heart to mend
That I'd turn around, and be broken again
(2x)

They told me to see the glass half full cause some see it as half empty
I chose to see the glass twice the size it needed to be
Smashed it against the wall in the kitchen
On the floor going through withdrawals I was itchin'
She rescued me, my heroine to the end
But then she morphed into heroin in a syringe
Around my bicep, I would tie a shoestring
Tap! five times to find a vein in there
Squeeze 7cc's so I could see the seven seas
And CC all my friends so they could see what I was seeing
But what they saw was a despicable human being
So, I guess they just wasn't seeing what I was seeing
Convert two into one, an indivisible plan
To discover what dreams may come for this invisible man
Sentimental education, beautiful weather
Dam was constantly catching fire
Richard Pryor
Her skin deteriorated
Family infuriated by the myriad of tracks but my train never came
So humiliated, started begging for change
Failed rehabilitation so the scars still remain
Nice clothes became frayed
So isolated and afraid
I smell like an animal my teeth enamel decayed and
I'm relocated in Alabama now
That Maalox and Mylanta now
And it won't stop the burn
Constantly searching for the answers how
I could kiss the sky without enhancing
But, it's so hard to learn",https://genius.com/Pharoahe-monch-broken-again-lyrics
Damage,PTSD: Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,2012.0,"Ooh, listen to the way I slay your crew
Damage, damage, damage, damage

They cock them hammers, wave them llamas

So when the cameras are attached to dollys, I call them dali lama's
Mold me, loathe, 
hold me in the palm of your hand
, 
load me
You know exactly what I am, murderer
When I'm inserted on to the top of fifteen family members
It's the curse of the proverbial anarchy starter, the martyr
This is what I have been converted to do what I do is insanity
Pro-fo-fo-fanity when they manually hammer me annually
You dont figitty faze me yo
I won't tigitty tase you bro
Figgity fucking cut you in half like it's nothing minus the laser scope
Then I will ring your bell like Avon
Before displaying some of my various tattoos (Trayvon)
The (Oscar) award winning (Aiyana Jones) hey (Sean)
Sworn to be cannon fodder for your father slaughter daughters
Armor piercing tumblers more deadlier than napalm
Fuck a stray bullet, I take aim when the gun draws
For ever-lasting fame I will maim those who change the gun laws
Cause post traumatic stress disorder,
 
ask any vet I've worked with
My purpose catching bodies like safety nets at the circus

Ooh, listen to the way I slay your crew
Damage, damage, damage, damage

Nigga I will twist your liver like Oliver (TWIST)
Scratch your name off my calendar

What you just heard was a .44 caliber
Now you can fill in the blanks
I will pillage your town
Killing them with Dillinger rounds
Nigga fill in the clip cause I'm willing to flip
See I'm sort of certified,
 
I'm fortified live
You would be mortified if I would put on screen what I've seen
Horrified holy Bibles, rivals, vital organs
Little bitty baby bodies, bridal gowns coffins
Morphine, gang bang, gangrene
, 
slauson, swap meet
Meet greet, pop I don't sleep, I don't stop
I love hate, hate cops
That's why I laugh when you pull it
I'm motivated and crass
I'm so elated when I see them on the news (you fuckin' pigs!)
They flying the flag half mass
See there's no need for conversation
When we're discussing the bullet's point of view

just getting home from last night's performance
When I'm dead tired from touring I hit the coffin
I'm like a vampire required to stay dormant
Out of the range, the sunlight with a doubt it'd remain
I used to smoke so much weed that it clouded my brain
I took a break, had to find life's meaning again
Without the smoke in my lungs I started dreaming again
I dreamed of candy-coated cars and panties that go with bra's
Hurricanes named Sandy, I'm floating on Noah's ark, what?
Police'll bleed blue cause he staying true to the uniform
Dennis Rodman in North Korea looking for unicorns (that's ridiculous)
The truth is I'm one of the best
And when you snooze that's when you meet the cousin of death
So when I say I never visited the cousin, I don't sleep

Clap (One Day),W.A.R. (We Are Renegades),2011.0,"You should never in your wildest dreams shit on a nigga
Police eat a dick, straight up, you know why?

Clap — clap on, clap off
Clap at them and I do not mean applause (Nah)
Rap nicer than Santa with no Claus
Track twice as bananas with no chorus
Uh, yeah, it's suicide murder
In the hood like catalytic converters
On the block like Lego,
 
in the streets like street light
Three Little Pigs is what I be on these beats like
In other words, the police, say it; say it like Pac: ""the po-lice""
Fuck' em, and that's straight from the underground
Where little kids got it bad 'cause we brown
Now, who am I? P-Monch from Do or Die
Nah, South Suicide, Queens, where I get down
I peep surveillance in the street every summer
You may not play lotto, but you know these numbers
The 105th, the 103rd
My peoples in Queens doing 13 if we get the urge
To get on some Todd Scott shit, my brain's a Glock clip
My lames be on some 1-800-COPSHOT shit

Say we were gonna, say we were gonna get it together
Yeah, yeah, yeah
One day, one day, one day, one day, one day
I said the people gon' clap
Watch me clap to this

We went from niggas to porch monkeys, to negroes, to blacks
Back to niggas again,
 
yet niggas is still hungry
""Abolish the N-word"",
, 
the plan's so corny
While Homeland Security cams are all on me
They watch through the fiber optics; it dawned on me
That cops can just run in your spot quick without warning
They educate the masses to follow, it's so boring
I sat in the back of the class, asleep, snoring
And they ask me why I'm vocal and adamant
'Cause I lost my focus like Governor Patterson
And the ghetto is impossible to escape
And the first obstacle is this tapeworm in my abdomen
Spear-chucker, fuck that, I toss javelins
And five-thousand dollar bills in the face of James Madison
This is an American post-mortem
To focus on you bogus 
Novus Ordo Seclorum, clap

Say we were gonna, say we were gonna get it together
Yeah, yeah, yeah
One day, one day, one day, one day, one day
I said the people gon' clap
Watch me clap to this

Now everybody watch me clap

No respect, no manners, it's Mad Max with 
multiple macs
Mad banana clips
 and a black hammer
That hits the back of a black talon
A slew of hollow tips through the wall of your blue silence
And selective theatrics, collective dramatics
I'm systematically pissed, clap automatics for 
Mumia Abu Jamal
Maybe I’m Crispus Attucks
P’s a fanatic for peace, but you angered a pacifist
The Gospel, I spit it like Jesus of Nazareth then emphatically clap
At any obstacle, an impossible feat, the fathom is not logical
But chronicle the thought of the people
'Cause one day we gon' clap",https://genius.com/Pharoahe-monch-clap-one-day-lyrics
Still Standing,W.A.R. (We Are Renegades),2011.0,"Yeah, uh, c'mon

They said, please do not run too fast, stay off of the leaves
Do not play in the grass or climb the trees
You can't breathe, let alone you get stung by bees
Lord Jesus, your chest just might freeze up
Thirteen months old with a lung disease
That almost took my life twice, brought me to my knees
A system not designed for you to achieve
Police squeeze, library lies, a teacher deceives
But I rose to the top of my class like cream
Or the Lakers in the 80s, so worthy, I'm Kareem
Not MTV, but my Sweet 16s
Married the mic, a love supreme
I'm clear it was a miracle the way I whetted the rhythm
Spiritual looking back at it, a lyrical exorcism
A half of the Afro-American dream
To rap or quarterback for a professional team
I'm still standing, yeah, I'm still here, I'm still standing

Still standing, I'm still here
(Still standing, yeah, still standing)
Still standing, I'm still here
(Still standing, yeah, still standing)
Still standing

Uh, I have no dead bodies to claim, never been a trigger man
Crack, never pedalled that, opposite of Jigga, man
Doubled my expectancy, can you believe it?
Look, no bullet wounds, not paraplegic
Still standing like the pledge of allegiance
Moves made both emotional and strategic
My heart disintegrated in a million pieces
Listen, that's life, deal with it
Press reset, download pain, write a thesis
Performed for millions, Brazilian visas
(I got) Transcontinental indigenous divas
That speak multiple languages for unspeakable reasons
And still, there are places that I never been
Like the Statue of Liberty, my knees will never bend
Except for when I'm speaking to God, it feels like halftime
I'ma reach for the stars, I'm still standing

Still standing, I'm still here
(Still standing, yeah, still standing)
Still standing, I'm still here
(Still standing, yeah, still standing)
Still standing

Now I, I've seen some heartbreak in my life
And some burdens almost broke me down once or twice
But I held on, on to my faith
And I would never change a thing that brought me here today
'Cause it helped me grow and it helped me know
Which way to go, and which way to not go
And I'm so grateful, yeah, I'm so grateful
'Cause I'm still, I'm still

Still standing, I'm still here
(Still standing, yeah, still standing)
Still standing, I'm still here

Try to resist I'll dimiss you
Fuck you (Fuck you)

Basically I'm the worst nightmare you ever had
Figure a trigger happy nigga with a badge
Parading around Los Angeles
High off coke with a banana clip
Feasting off the weak street evangelists
With a manuscript in professional ass-whipping
Task force, brass knuckles, a master in ass-kicking
If you ask for it, I blast for it, you're back flipping
No one saw it, I won't stop, the clock's ticking
Got a rookie for a partner that's ready to fight niggas
The world's a merry-go-round, I stereotype niggas
He's a spit in the face for pitbull or bite niggas
Matter of fact, kinda like this cat for a white nigga

Get your hands

I'm not fucking around with you
Try to resist I'll dimiss you

I got the projects on lock, they trust my logic
Cause the star cops got it from guns to narcotics
My object is to deprogram, blind your optics
You cannot stop this mission, this topic
Cause you could write tickets my nigga or get paid
Learn this game in the streets or get slayed
Collect this cheese at the end of this maze
Or hit the desk and fill out forms for days
Need I remind you, how easy it would be
To take the city by storm, with a whole force behind you
Shottie in the trunk and on my ankle there's a nine too
Cause psychologically the guns you use will define you

Get your hands

I'm not fucking around with you
Try to resist I'll dimiss you

These evil streets don't sleep, be careful with whom you mingle
In a city where it pays to be bilingual
Yo soy grifo, no me importa tu culo, si, via a diablo
I'm five-oh, leaving enemies dead on arrival
For a couple of mil', and you're fucking the deal up
Try to play hero cop and you still suck
Put you to bed, one in your head, you won't feel much

Evolve,W.A.R. (We Are Renegades),2011.0,"Desperate wait for those in a desperate situation
Homeless and hungry
Having stands displaced, reliant on aid
 disaster may be unfolding right now
It has been hit by a  earthquake

Yes, how many gorillas who actually killers really rhyming?
Artists that actually signed still killing?
And when it comes to killing the mic, they're not willing
And I'm supposed to be shook? That's the shit that kill me
Take the bullet for Barack on the balcony, then vanish
Extinguish the sun when I drool, play pool with the planets
We are renegades, the movement outlandish
My shit straight from the soul, goddammit
It's the one time only, vernacular original
Miraculous spectacular flow, computer digital
I piss upon the pitiful, ridicule the minuscule
Pharoahe Monch need to park that ass like municipal
And listen to an enigma
The anomaly, your momma nominated me phenomenal
I dominated without a six-pack abdominal
You could get 19 put through that, like Amadou
So what I'ma do is separate the false from the truest
You've amassed nothing trying to ball like U-Mass
So phenomenal with mics, I don't like myself
Sadomasochist MC, I bite myself
But not cameo though, there's no Grammy to show
For the love that people hand me on the street, now overstand
Grade school mathematics, examining thugs
They discuss Bloods, Crips, techs, jammin' and drugs
I speak of world peace, war, famine, and flood
Watching Pan's Labrynth while I'm unraveling bud
Gambling on the next rapper to die in the hood
If God shall choose that artist to be me
Let one verse of a song be a reflection of a pedigree
Better than your back catalog recipe
The legacy by which the entire world remembers me
Quote, do not edit me; let it be said
I'm top five all time (Alive or...)
We know that's misstated and so overused
So here's an overview of why I'm six feet over you
And a million fans think this statement is so overdue
And pardon if it sounds a little wheezy
Not Wayne, motherfuckers, I got asthma; it's not easy
Shotgun lyrical; cock back, squeeze me
Women case my anatomy; touch me, tease me
Please seize the moment in the struggle against Lucifer
Renegade 13, the Executioner
Spit with a crucifix

Get used to it, get used to wisdom
Get used to usage of a backward euphemism",https://genius.com/Pharoahe-monch-evolve-lyrics
Rape,Internal Affairs,1999.0,"I'm obsessed with multiple nude photographs
Of the beat in my room on the wall
Pondering the verses, fondling my balls
Witness a nigga who will take rap and chase it
Through unoccupied dimly lit staircases and rape it
Grab the drums by the waistline
I snatch the kick, kick the snares and sodomize the bassline
Never waste time, I give the verse rabies
Cum on the chorus, tell the hook 
to swallow my babies
Maybe I might switch, let the witch live
The original plan was to kill the bitch on the bridge
Ditch the body parts off somewhere near the 
crescendo
When my innuendos elapse, my mental window attacks
The instrumental elapses
Perhaps that's the only reason that I spared her life
You could solo my fucking vocals and I still get trife
Slice the rhythm, disfigure the face of the groove
For any fader that flies or knobs or button that moves

Consider this, the loops are similar to clitorises exposed
On your miss is a hole, a vicious cycle of sin
That doesn't end 'til I stop fuckin'
A million emcees and they ain't saying nothing

Ain't fucking it right, they ain't fucking it right
They ain't fucking it right, they ain't fucking it right
They ain't fucking it like me

She had the nerve to take the case to court
Knowing I rape for sport
Took the stand crying, denying her whole involvement, lying
Why would an ex-cop lie in a sex shop fly?
Linen down grinning with my coat over my shoulder sitting
Browsing pornography (uh!)
The stenographer smiling the whole time
While jotting verbal photography
Her eyes mahogany, I flashed to a photo
In my mind of a body bludgeoned with slashed arteries
Pardon me, back to the case, slap in the face
Examining the jury similar to cracking a safe
What happens to bass? It was an instinct
I would inhale eighths
Sniff that, sat her ass all over my face to taste it
To hell with 1980 remixes, fuck disco
Turned on the 3000, stuck my dick where the disc go
Yokonaz, ripped the sexy MPC 60
Buying a ticket to hell, verbally dicking the 12 down
Sound shitty, I knew she used to be gritty
Too many impotent emcees in this God-forsaken city

Ain't fucking it right, ain't fucking it right
They ain't fucking it like me

Consider this, loops are similar to clitorises exposed
On your miss is a hole, a vicious cycle of sin
That doesn't end 'til I stop fuckin'
A million emcees and they ain't saying nothing

Losing My Mind,PTSD: Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,2014.0,"A clock without a minute hand
An hourglass without sand
Suspended within space and time
I walk a thin line
Amongst the masses all alone
A furnished house with no one home
I see through walls that’s hard to climb
I’m losing my mind

No medicaid, no medication
Thinking you're better off dead
Instead should have been dedicated to education
I spin, the cylinder on my revolver
I spin, the cylinder
Would someone explain who’d leave a dick in charge of a bush
Of a colon I’m screwed
, 
saw more war than Warsaw Poland, viewed
An infant’s insides, outside of his body
Inside of a place of worship, ungodly
Out cries tears “Dear God, where are we?”
That’s what I scream towards the skyline but probably
No one can hear a word of what I was saying
Insurgents surged in the temple where I was praying
Now flashbacks wake me abruptly when police pass by
Lights flash, if i could only put the past on a flashdrive I’d
For peace of mind, install an external drive
So I’d be more driven internally to survive
I’m...

A clock without a minute hand
An hourglass without sand
(So I spin, the cylinder on my revolver
I spin, the cylinder on my revolver)
Amongst the masses all alone
A furnished house with no one home
(So I spin, the cylinder on my revolver
I spin, the cylinder on my revolver)

My family customs were not accustomed to dealing with mental health
It was more or less an issue for white families with wealth
Void, I defected, employed self annoyed
Went independent, enjoyed stealth
Now doctors prescribed sedatives and Prozac
The rent’s cheaper in the ghetto but you can’t go back
So I, spin the cylinder on my revolver
Then, maybe let it draw blood like Chupacabra
And dissolve into the abyss, without evolving
Instead of revolving around the habitual problem solver
Research like, George Washington Carver
But no answer so my mantra is to deal with it in and chart then
Part, instead of being incredibly defiant
Peddle through revenue issues I’ll do it for medical science
It’s better to be level-headed than to regret it and pious
Settling for life without sun-shine, never vibrant, I’m...

A clock without a minute hand

So let me explain the game
Break it down a couple levels like Tetris
These young'uns kill they own blood for a necklace (Gimme that)
Leave slumped over the wheel of your Lexus
Smoke kush, wake up and eat breakfast
What the fuck he expect?
A generation overly obsessed with mobsters
Our revolutionaries won Grammys and Oscars
Impostors, fake auras or weak chakras
Makin' a mockery of the music to be pop stars
And they say I'm insane
Because I see the remains of the whips and the chains
In my hood where it ain't all good
Peep the pain of a single mother, she struggling
Young child slain, give me five on the black hand side
Let’s maintain like it’s Soul Train
And keep it movin' together, I’m saying

The machine is corrupted down to the core
Rebel army, motherfucker, this means war

I got a middle finger for mass media, mute the news
'Cause 'When The Gun Draws' received a million views
Which gives me the right to break the rules
Say, fuck radio if the people can't pick and choose
While BET gets screwed by Viacom
The new revolutionary is shyaman
It's not brush fire rap, it's five alarm
Motivational music after I am gone
My inner visions, mysticism, call me Mr. Wisdom
They wanna turn the globe into a prison
And being sick is better than being dead
'Cause when you sick and in bed, you're indebted to meds
Cloned chickens walking around without heads
The food is contaminated, the water got lead in it

My stimuli's supplied by my endorphins
The mind's eye greater than pi and broadband
I break on through to the other side without doormen
It's not The Doors, man

With more keys to open more doors than four foremen
To executive's rooms where they walking on all fours, man

The Jungle,PTSD: Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,2014.0,"Southside, you know we living in the jungle
Brook'nam
, you know we living in the jungle

See them gorillas over there in the park, them my niggas
After dark we get sparked up and pull triggers
You gotta speak orangutan slang or pull capers
The cops are the cheetahs and the trees are the skyscrapers
See 
in the jungle we often rumble
 for loot
Some of us just stumble around high off the booze, shoot
You get shot, shit
Play humble like last year when the cheetahs tried to catch my uncle
When you come through, you could get bumped too
If you don't got at least 4 to 5 gorillas amongst you
The bigger tree hit 'em shocked and amazed
41 shots hot, take you out in the blaze
And if not, they ship your ass to the Bronx in a cage
Into the island where you spend your time counting the days
But still agriculturally, it's kind of ill, we blow mills
They make a killing and build new lands in the jungle

Shaolin
, you know we living in the jungle
Chi-town
, you know we living in the jungle
Westside, you know we living in the jungle

I tell these chimpanzees who be carrying tools
You don't wanna invest your life in a cesspool
Pharmaceutical distributin', breaking the rules
You need to take your monkey ass off to school
And learn about Botswana, Sudan and Ghana
Mozambique and speak of pride and honor
I understand sometimes we all feel fenced in
But utilize your mind to define dimensions
Just then I lost the little monkey's attention
As he stared into the distance focusing and squinting at a
Beautiful gazelle that was grazing in the grass with
Muscular legs and a rhinoceros ass
But in the least case scenario I did try to tell him
Hit him with some signs that was a little compelling
Little gibbon on a mission, not unlike Magellan
What you caught was some felons, crimes and drug selling in the jungle

Yo, 
Ghana
, you know we living in the jungle
Cape Town
, you know we living in the jungle
Jo-burg
, you know we living in the jungle

I'm talking epileptic episodes off that Epinephrine
That Albuterol and them other prescribed medicines
A zombie in insomnia frecking the Amphetamines
My moms had me smoking weed from the Netherlands at age 13
Broke apart the scene, a lot of moist weed that was sticky and green
See in the 80's it was wine-coolers and woolies
The Facts of Life, crack, David Dinkins and toolies
Mike Jack said ""kick me, kike me, Jew me""
Now all the white chicks in the world got booties
He rap by popular demand
And a nigga nosey on some Toucan Sam shit
You not Florida A&M, you not fam, dawg
That would be (Marco), that's my man
For biceps I isolate with one hand
For triceps I do reps with dip sets, but not Cam
Scandal, governors busted, got damn
Power to the people unite with one plan
I used to write about green eggs and ham
'Til I found out the Food and Drug Administration was a scam
Now we steam vegetables, brown, forget the white rice
My life is all I have

studying zeitgeist
Lyrics bang now and again, sing like the Chi-Lites
It's my right to use my power to shine my light
To function, you know the function
Yo, Pharoahe Monch, what's your motherfucking function?
I go to Queens for queens, I eat organic in Brooklyn
Swing on a vine over the swine and keep 'em shook
And take the anaconda through the tunnels
Through the Mecca where the piranha try to ball and style on the persona
You know I keep it on the low like an iguana
When the monikers never leave the crib without the llama in the..",https://genius.com/Pharoahe-monch-the-jungle-lyrics
The Light,Internal Affairs,1999.0,"It was like the earth twisted around her
She shifted the ground, I was like, ""Ohhhhh... shit!""
She's off the hook, I would dress her decently
But look, her body is immaculate
I'm attacking it from all positions of thinking inside my mind
Hopefully it won't be too inappropriate if I walk over there
And say, ""Excuse me, can I have your number please?
I'll get on my knees if I have to""
She'll laugh through the whole episode
Just then I knew I had her locked down
No cock-blocking please, this one's mine
Dimepiece and shit, son, shorty was fine
Every line of mine was like a rhyme, I wouldn't lie, I swear
Sparkling the whole time as I whispered in her ear

And I know you will see the light, baby
Once you understand
What you mean to me, darling
And I know you will see the light, baby
Once you understand
What you mean to me, darling

Now some say I'm a little bit of thug slash b-boy gentleman
But let me introduce myself
Also begin, so that you can further understand what I say
I took this last swallow of the Grand Marnier
And slid her to the dancefloor, now she like, ""Wow!
Oh, damn, money got style""
Funny how things change when you got a little liquor in you
You're quicker with the tongue, giving me rhythm now, huh
Block the music and the people out to admire the love
The nerve of us, impervious to the entire club
And like marijuana shotguns, let's blow this joint
It's pointless to stay here, so let me anoint

And I know you will see the light, baby
Once you understand
What you mean to me, darling
And I know you will see the light, baby
Once you understand
What you mean to me, darling

We kissing and we wrestling, sexual confessions
I never lack to pack prophylact', I learned my lesson
First impression, to be discrete, use discretion
Back of the cab, undressin', uh-huh
I'm here with you, sort of like a bond, spiritual
All night, all I could do is stare at you
Cracked the window and the Alizé on the Palisades
Right before she told me her name was Valerie
Her crib was just a mile away, nothing to my salary
She could serve me pain all night and I could tolerate
I'm her horizon, right, but in the night though
Night glow type shit

And I know you will see the light, baby
Once you understand
What you mean to me, darling
And I know you will see the light, baby
Once you understand
What you mean to me, darling

And I know can see the light, baby
Once you understand
What, what you mean to me, girl
What you do, no doubt, check it out now
Now I know you can see the light, baby
Once you understand",https://genius.com/Pharoahe-monch-the-light-lyrics

What is a scorpion? An animal that stings
I'm like a bat with blood coming out the wings
You should never in your wildest dreams
Shit on a nigga who resides in the borough of Queens
Strong wicked, in the Lex on the celly
Now you getting fucked without the K-Y Jelly
How I made it, you salivated over my calibrated raps
That validated my ghetto credibility
Still, I be packing agilities unseen
For real-a my killing abilities, unclean facilities
For more inter-military tactics obscene, extreme confidential
My exterior serene with the potential of a killing machine
Ex-Marine, you drag queen, we tag-team
Queens' finest, the alliance defiant, we bag fiends

You don't have to do the math
In Southside...
Queens, Queens

I knew this nigga named Donovan
Astonishing, the way he used to handle the pill, God (Word)
Let me speak about the way he used to dribble off his knees
And in the middle, at the same time, guzzling a beer
Like a puzzle or a riddle, discovering his path to the hoop
Scoop, shot, tipped up the backboard, oops
Son got hops, never knew he would've grew it
Cool nigga, when it came to school, he blew it
A scholar in acute nigga-risms and metropolitans
Kids hollering, ""Yo, Donovan, hey, come around the block""
Youngest of three sons, fucking with coupons and refunds
Food stamps; still, he was a champ
Time to get loot for boots and kicks now
Fuck hoops, gotta impress the chicks now
His mama said, ""Donovan, why are you
On the corner of Linden and Guy R. Brewer?""
He said, ""Mama, listen close, I'mma tell you one time
You're killing my high, plus, I got a nine"" (What?)
""All I be doing is putting in work
So you can get a brand new dress for church
I know the Devil lurks outside, man, it's cold
But I don't wanna get paid slow and grow old like Papa
Plus I'm on parole, I got-ta
Get paid off the streets to make ends meet""
With the back of her hand, she smacked him in the face
Walked out of the crib-piece, pissed with no chase
That night, rocking Nikes, eating Mike and Ikes
Slapboxing with a dyke on a bike too small
Thinking, ""This time, next year, Mama be able to—Ohh, shit!""
From across the streets, niggas approach (Slow)
Well, get the metal out, too late, the guns flash
In the melee, they wet him like Reggae Sunsplash
Son dashed with the quickness, back into the ride
With a smile on his face, the picture of pride
Blood coming from his mouth; now, I'm at his side
Kneeling over Donovan's body before he died
Eyes fluttering up and down in his head
And with his last breath, this is what he said
He said, ""Why?
Why?""
Then I closed his eyes

There's a place I know where the people go
Where you could catch dough and chill on the low
In Southside... Haha
Queens, Queens
Where if you say, ""The Ave""
People automatically know the path
You don't have to do the math

Like Todd Scott, when the block be hot
In—In—In— (What we talking 'bout?)

Trilogy,Desire,2007.0,"I now pronounce you husband and wife
You may now kiss the bride
Act I:

Cops comin', shots fired
Babies cry, I cry
Wishin' I could change what
This is just my life
Cops comin', shots fired
Babies cry, I cry
Wishin' I could change what
This is just my life

God, why is my wife bleeding?
Sheet covers her face, paramedics are leaving
Behind her clothes, it's apparent she's not breathing
I'm a little confused about what it is I'm seeing
Plus, there's a naked man on my lawn
Police in the living room with all of their guns drawn
Out, and the last thing I remember is
Uh, last thing I remember is
I received a text page from Julio
Who expressed that I left my cellphone in the studio
Right underneath the disc with the 
Pro Tools
Next to a six-pack of O'Doul's and some soul food
Yeah, and I was on my way home
Exit the expressway to use the payphone
But fuck it, 'cause my wife isn't back from her trip
I sneak the  into the house and she'll never expect it
Except that though

Cops comin', shots fired
Babies cry, I cry
Wishin' I could change what
This is just my life
Cops comin', shots fired
Babies cry, I cry
Wishin' I could change what
This is just my life
Act II:

He put the gun in my hand
Told me, go take my revenge
Killing him won't make it go away
It's only gon' bring more pain

I tied his hands behind his back to the night-stand, fast
Ropes made bruises on his light-skinned ass
""See, I can play games too""
Yeah, that's what I told him when he came to
Now look, see what the game and the fame do?
Made a deranged mind out of someone in your same crew
Fuck, man, we grew up together
Run-DMC, tougher than leather
With the same outfits,
 forty-deuce
Takin' flicks like, ""What?"" ""Shit!""
Why did you fuck my wife, man?
You should've took my life, man
I switched the gun into my right hand
The sweat accumulated on his forehead, 
I saw red, he said
*muffled talking*
Now was it worth it, man?
Was it everything you imagined, was it perfect?

He put the gun in my hand
Told me, go take my revenge
Killing him won't make it go away
It's only gon' bring more pain


He put the gun in my hand
And told, told me to go take my revenge (Take my revenge)
Killing him won't make it go away, no
It's only gon' bring more pain
Act III:

Took you to be my lawfully wedded wife
To have, to hold, to love, to cherish, but
Death did us part, what a coincidence
Now perhaps the police will be convinced that it was an accident
If I'm accurate and careful with the evidence
This motherfucker says, passing up my residence
And to believe those files set a precedence
From the start, it should've been obvious it never did
Prevalent, the wicked debauchery and decadence
Was carried out with such masterful excellence
And this is the stick where you rip my heart
It was natural to transform murder into art
And the weight of my conscience would knowingly carry
Three-sixty-five days to the date that we was married
Thoughts of how I would achieve the murder would vary
We're closer than ever, together we'll be buried 'cause

Evil eyes that bide, how they go you so much
Why do we, what did they see?
I just lost control, had to let you go
I cry 'cause slowly you try, so slowly you die

Buried alive in the grave, too exhausted to climb out
Before dirt was tossed on me, come to find out
No friend of mine, she sleeping with committed the crime
In the past three years, switched identities six times
And all the while I'm devoted to love and loyalty
They plotted on my publishing checks and royalties
She thinking it's true love, he's scamming her for the guap
Got alone to devise my own intuitive plot
Put the prose on him, launched the probe on him
And I haunt him, pen him, get him exactly where I wanted him
Cornered him, now his mission is aborted
You are about to be professionally extorted
Guess we all 'bout to murder tonight
Miss Pretty Brown Eyes while she sleeps under the moonlight
Do it and bounce, the keys to the crib
You'll find under the mat in the front of the house
Just do it, word out

Evil eyes that bide, how they go you so much
Why do we, what did they see?
I just lost control, had to let you go
I cry 'cause slowly you try, so slowly you die",https://genius.com/Pharoahe-monch-trilogy-lyrics

The Apocalypse, back by popular demand
Innocuous, but still leave a stage
With blood in my hand for the populous
Put a fist in the sky

King Jaffe in the lobby with the fur made of a lion
The eye of Horus, Mount Zion vibrant
Prominent constellations of Orion (Whoa!)
The reason why my stars are in alignment
The renegade, an Allahu Akbar rock star
Tossing homemade grenade CDs at NYPD cop cars
Just to get the revolution to pop off
Fraudulent stock, funded with Louis Vuitton knock-offs
Hijacking helicopters, detonate your metropolis
While I'm in the cockpit, politicking like Stephanopoulos
And my esophagus is quite atomic when I vomit
This is bio-engineered ergonomics
The formula, truth divided by innovative ebonics
Times Goose, lime, crushed ice and a splash of tonic
Nigga, my past lives are astronomic
Smoking hash in a cathedral with Nostradamus
At mass, discussing Martin Luther's 'Free at Last' speech
Step on my British Walkers, get your ass beat

When I drink away the pain I guzzle
My life is like a complicated mathematical puzzle, for real
Seen death twice, it's ugly motherfucker man
But you conversate with him when you suffering

Your choice, slug to the brain or 20 Vicodin""
I kinda likened it to Ortho Tri-Cyclen
Disturbing the natural cycles of life and it's trifling
Fuck what you heard, less money more problems
4 years removed from the game with no album
I put the gun to my brain, but first I wrote a note to explain
Put the Luger in my head, and these are the words that I said

Sure as kingdoms rise the same kingdoms will surely fall
And wash away like memories, as if they weren't there at all
Like broken limbs of trees that's lost its leaves to Winter's wind
Spring will come again..
Live...
Live...
Live...
Live

When your cerebral ceases to administer solace
And the only Faith you have left is a CD
From a singer who had a son with Christopher Wallace
Tomorrow is never
Hope is abolished
Mind and soul have little to no unity
Life threw a brick through my window of opportunity
My immune system lacked diplomatic immunity
When asthma attacks the black community
Where do you go from there?
Long walk, short pier
Thought I knew all it was just to know of the ledge
Till I glanced down at all ten toes on the ledge
Before I heard what sounded to me like a pledge
Emerged from the darkness, and this is what it said
""Do not despair, breathe, fight
For there is more life to live, believe
More insight to share, retrieve
Must dare to be illustrious
Exhale, hold, inhale, receive and live...

When the Gun Draws,The Awakening,2007.0,"Something is wrong in this nation
When a child can grab a guns—grab a gun so easily
And shoot a bullet
Into the middle of a child's face, as my daughter experienced
Something is wrong

First the gun draws and you know that something's happening
Then darkness falls and, oh, your heart beats rapidly
Be prepared because war is coming
You can't be scared now, when the streets is calling you

Good evening, my name's Mr. Bullet
I respond to the index when you pull it
The trigger, 
so make a note, take a vote
Quick man, nickname's 'Quaker Oats' 'cause
Whether domestic violence or coke deals
See, I lust to change brain matter to oatmeal
And when I kill kids, they say shame on me
Who the fuck told you to put they names on me?
White man made me venom to eliminate
Especially when I'm in the hood, I never discriminate
Just get in 'em, then I renovate
Flesh, bone, ain't nothin' for me to penetrate
And it can happen so swiftly
One false move just might shift me
If I'm enlodged and your soul's not claimed
I will remind that ass when it's about to rain, like

First the gun draws and you know that something's happening
Then darkness falls and, oh, your heart beats rapidly
Be prepared because war is coming
You can't be scared now, when the streets is calling you

Would the new method of murder be arson or firebombs
If the cost of a single bullet was more than the firearm?
Strange, that is, when all exits are final
Point blank; range, that is
My attitude is cold and callous
Killed kings in Tennessee,
 
presidents in Dallas
And if the past be known, at last we know
What happened that afternoon on the Grassy Knoll
It's what made a widow of Jackie O
The government hired Lee Harvey to blast me, though
Fatality shot entered from the right temple
Was not fired from a six-story window
Can it be that it was all so simple
But yet remains so painful to rekindle?
I come through your city, I'm hot
Whether you're jiggy or not, whether you're Biggie or Pac
When the gun draws

First the gun draws and you know that something's happening
Then darkness falls and, oh, your heart beats rapidly

We will no longer communicate with vocal inflections
It will be necessary to communicate through telekinesis

Beat three cases, see three POs
Before Morpheus and Neo was killing 'em

Flies all in my teeth, stomach sticking out
Niggas want dibs on the weed but ain't kicking out

This is me trying to eat, human survival
Spit at your favorite rapper, take his title
Stick needles in his eyeballs 'til his signs are no longer vital
This ain't that, I'm not them
These ain't those rhymes, I'm not him

No, more like sunshine
And one line of mine'll remind you of when you were nine
Before you were busting cherries, it wasn't necessary to grind then
Now we all on our grizzly
And you got the nerve to press Frisbees

Practicing my aim, catch you in your brain
Shame, they thought I was backpack
Slept, didn't know that he kept inside the knapsack
Today's niggas do skate-by hits
Run in your crib on some Queer Eye For The Straight Guy shit
But not homosexuals, they mastering gunplay
Rearrange your furniture, fix your feng shui
They be swearing it's cute
But I be up in the club, box-cutter in the boot
With the sex appeal and no ice either
The right to bear arms, I'm not talking wife-beaters either
When they see me they say, ""That's that nigga""
My last name should be 'That's That Nigga'
Sounds kinda nice, 'Pharoahe That's That...'
Never catch me with them plastic half-ass niggas
With the flow that's so influential
Niggas fucked up they get no instrumentals now
Next time you spitting on mine
Bet your bottom dollar you be spitting over rhymes

What it is, what it is, what it is, what it is

Yeah, somebody say let my people go
Hey, somebody say let my people go

Spit miraculously, sip Dracula's blood exist for centuries
The body chemistry mends wounds, heals injuries
My ministry leaves the industry in a tail spin
Ha, I push the envelope like US mailmen
Ha, we need a leader who is not mischievous
Devious, from Satan’s grip to lead us
Won't retract the facts then act facetious
In fact, the raps are packed with facts that teach us
Reach us, easily leave MCs speechless
Read from the palm of the non-believers
Sell 'em, they wondering how they become underachievers
One of the best of the perennial keynote speaker
My guidance, you want it, come get it, so I’ll flaunt it
And I will show you a way to let my people go today

I'm too high to get over, too low to get under

They’re trying to sell lies to the people, huh?
Knowing it's hard times for the people, huh?
I'll knock your ass unconscious
Put it up on YouTube, then film the sequel
So it's free for the people, huh
Go on ahead and download it, I'ma teach you how
P is a prophet, a pastor, a preacher
With undisputable logic for blasting through your speaker now
I'm trying to learn your monkey ass, I'm trying to reach you now
But still, you're like, ""Who's this dude?""
Return to fix, shape the game like Rubik's Cube
Chicks see he's brolic, now ruthless too
Spit the gospel on wax, what he chooses to do, damn
Open your eyes, man, you've been bamboozled
By the usual plans, 
hit up the middle like Stan Musial
If y'all are telling me today's music is suitable and appealing
Then I'm telling you the feelings are not mutual

I'm too high to get over, too low to get under

Young children, pull your pants on up
Who wants to see the crack of your ass and see your butt?
You need to let all the people go
Pass the collection plates and give me all of my dough
And if you’re wondering what’s under my robe
An old rusty-ass .38 snub nose
And just because you’re thinking that my shit don't work
That's a 
*gunshot*
Go on and try robbing my church

I'm too high to get over, too low to get under

Book of Judges,Desire,2007.0,"America the ugly raped my mother
Deceived my sister, separated my brother
Murdered my children, hung my father
Now they want me to rock the vote, the fucks, why bother?
Seen the commercials for they army or whatever
Picture me giving a damn? I said, ""Never""
My mind's too sharp, my brain's too clever
My spine is too strong, every line pulls your lever
Limitless rhymes for the indigenous, the remedy
Plot — gettin' my money like the Kennedys
Flip it — put em' in stocks, collect indemnities
Rock — roll, behold my epiphanies, and
Read 'em and weep, heat 'em, I beat 'em to sleep
Mislead 'em til we even Steven, defeat 'em with freedom of speech
And let 'em know that I'm the motherfuckin' fire-starter
Piss on the Constitution, then burn the Magna Carta

All I know is what I feel
Deceive my eyes and distort what's real
Only truth will set you free
I'd rather die on my feet than to live on my knees

We dying over black gold, they harvesting the sand
Presidents living marvelous, they starving in Sudan
It's obvious you walk a blind path to oblivion
The book of judges read the scriptures unlike Gideon
Light my fire, start my engine
When Pharoahe becomes Moses, it's medicine for who listens
A veteran with a mic bringing prophecies to fruition
Motivational verses under adverse conditions
You're caught in the mainframe, I've seen the maze, man
They watch you from the street lights, you and your main man
The bar code around your neck same as your name brand
You're lost in a strange land, no thoughts of a game plan

All I know is what I feel
Deceive my eyes and distort what's real
Only truth will set you free
I'd rather die on my feet than to live on my knees

Welcome to the Terrordome,Desire,2007.0,"(*voice being scratched*)
In a time when we're spending billions of dollars
In a war to control oil in Iraq
Three-thousand soldiers have come home in coffins
Hundreds of thousands of Iraq civilians have lost their lives
Our brothers and sisters in New Orleans
Are left homeless and hungry
They murdered Sean Bell
They murdered Amadou Diallo
They murdered Timothy Stansbury
And it's time to say no more!
No more! No more! No more! No more!

I got so much trouble on my mind, refuse to lose
Here's your ticket, uh, hear the drummer get wicked
The crew to you to push the back to black attack
So I sat and japped, then slapped the Mac
Now I'm ready to mic it, huh
Hear my favoritism roll, oh, never be a brother like me go solo
Lazer, Anastasia, maze ya, ways to blaze your brain and train ya
The way I'm livin', forgiven, what I'm givin' up
X on the flex (Hear me now)
I don't know about later
As for now, I know how to avoid the paranoid
Man, I've had it up to here, gear I wear got 'em goin in fear
Rhetoric said, it read just a bit ago
Not quittin', it signed the hard rhymer
Work to keep from gettin' jerked
Changin' some ways to way back in the better days
Raw, metaphysically bold, never follow the code
Still dropped a load
Never question what I am, God knows
'Cause it's comin' from the heart
What I got, better get some (Mm-hmm), hustler of culture
Snake bitten, been spit in the face
But the rhymes keep fittin', respects been givin', how's ya livin'?
Now I can't protect a pad off the defect
Check the record of reckon
An international wreck played off as some intellect
Made the call, took the fall, broke the laws
Not my fault that they're fallin' off
Known as fair square throughout my years
So I growl at the livin' foul
Black to the bone, my home is your home
So welcome to the terrordome

Come on down (Get down)
You can get it, get it, get it, get it
Come on down
You can get it, get it, get it, get it
Get down
You can get it, get it, get it, get it

There's a hole in an apple, an apple has been rotten
Scheme like the Klan, I plan like Bin Laden
Supreme screen writer, slick street editor
Drop the LP and he hit like Hezbollah
Seven years later, it's the year of the Gods
United States government is just a facade
The Catholic Church got ties with the mob
I see it all like The Wizard of Oz
Now there's a yellow brick road, the fame, riches and cars
If you only had a brain, you would know who you are
Poison your ventilation, cut your education
Secret information, world domination
Take over reservations, trigger the energies
In the oceans for tsunamis to control the population
Eyes in the sky, hidden observation
If you're over 65, they'll take away your medication
Like, ""Give me that"" (Give me that), ""Fall in line"" (Fall in line)
""Go to war"" (Go to war), press rewind
'Cause when I get mad, I put it down on the pad
Give you somethin' that you never had
Controllin', fear of high rollin'
God bless your soul and keep livin'
Black to the bone, my home is your home
Well, welcome to the terrordome

Quirk-ass MCs be as queer as folk
Talkin' about, ""Nigga can rap!"" No shit, Sherlock

On the cellular, my genitalia pitched the pelvis
Uh-huh, when her hips gyrate like Elvis
She tried to scurry hurry to finish very alone
Tell my doggs what's necessary 'bout how I bury the bone
She said, ""When you ready to blast, don't ask, say when""
Had her screaming like lighting a nuke when I was halfway in
In the past I used to send 'em back, give 'em the minimum
Now I leave 'em with venom on their chin when I'm bending 'em
Y'all know the name, get it engraved, sex slave
Stadium style, from the back, ass doing the wave (Hey!)
Yelling to me is a felony
Hell'll be froze over when I celebrate celibacy, case closed
My dick rules everything around me, D.R.E.A.M
Get the ass without spending the cash, now look at 'em
Standing tall with the veins all in it
Nuts ripped up with the brain all in it
My man Mike to see more dick than Dastardly and Van Dyke together
Help me make it through the pain, struggle and the bad weather

Five Fingers of Death

Tonight's entree is cherries Bombay and Thai-Thai's flavored café latte
Broke-ass bumbaclaat, let's rock, can't play with mines
Need nine inches dangling, pinching my spine
Hanging ten with the best of wenches that never flinches
Bench your game, poor form won't score
Gotta hit the backboard, like it raw backdoor
Want to pause hardcore porn style, baby
Who do it better? Say my name backwards and spell each letter
Be having grams of spasm, leaving on a stretcher
And gets you wetter and incredible, suction
Punk-ass you're whack pumping, ready to rupture
Busting wildly like NYPD
So typically we wasn't ready for the fantasy freak
Don't sleep, privately I peep with devices
Energizers keep me vibrating in a crisis
Representing my bitches, throwing clitorises

As you grow strong, things'll change
No pain (No more pain), no gain (No more pain)

Please be willin' to fight for your will
Despite writings from William Lynch
Millions tried to rise like helium
But died in the fields and the trenches
Cries from the killing is senseless
Eyes to the ceiling, it quenches
A thirst and a feeling that's endless
The prize like a rain that wrenches the soul
And cleanses your mind from white picketed fences
Heads up your ass, splinters in face, mentally ridin' benches
The masters, pastors, disastrous but fascist bastards
They crafted this hazardous plan
That still has us broken and battered
We shoulder the struggle with the weight of a boulder
That muffles the sound of provocative thinking
The pieces of puzzles incompleted, only deleted
To be pushed to the back of your mind
Like a hairline that has receded
Now we repeated the process, but never weeded the problem out
Heeded the warnings, but never proceeded to solve it
No forward progress, it's obvious the soul is gone
I meditate and pray that these words will somehow allow you to

Hold on, I'm sure
There's so much more to live for
If you hold on, things'll change
So come on, be strong
And hold on, I'm sure
There's so much more to live for
As you grow strong, things'll change
No pain (No more pain), no gain (No more pain)

See, now Diamond is priceless
Timeless, how she maneuvers like Heimlich
In this new world, it reminds me of Isis
She knows now that her complexion is a holy device
A protection from UV rays in this negative time of crisis
Like a knife through butter slices
Easily to anger, she reacts pious
Like a cell protecting itself from a virus
Twice is strong is her demeanor, now she is righteous
God is what you see now when you peer inside her eyelids

Hold on, I'm sure
There's so much more to live for
If you hold on, things'll change
So come on, be strong
And hold on, I'm sure
There's so much more to live for
As you grow strong, things'll change
No pain (No more pain), no gain (No more pain)

You're so beautiful
You can change this world
If you want to girl

Now come on, hold on
Grow strong",https://genius.com/Pharoahe-monch-hold-on-lyrics

Still pass a polygraph
Nina in my right hand, her cousins on the night stand

Slick sentences, diatribes defenseless
When soliloquies set in, it's like cyanide

I'm glad we could make it out
You're so cool

Poppa was a rolling stone, the streets is all he left me

But now the cops know that I bop with a ca ca cane

The police booked me for Booksmarts
But who the promoters book now?
Raised the bar so high that the bar's afraid to look down
Spent nights in a casket, at dawn, I'm a king
Play pawn to a queen, put her throat in the tabernacle

Of my likeness in the center of your city

Sometimes I think I need to - scream
This war with self is so extreme
Sometimes I think I need to
Scream, scream, scream

Press your luck, fuck a press kit, press can't harm me
But chest presses a deadlift, bench press zombies
Hysteria rap burn the flag, fuck America
Start the revolution, poison the water with malaria
Fuck it, I came back from the war of scorn
Like Uncle Ruckus throwing bananas on the White House lawn
Cryptic anarchists spit that apocalyptic dark shit
Communists, radicals, racism, Marxist
You couldn't possibly wanna lock horns
Spit holy water on your throne wearing a crown made of thorns
*Ouy Kcuf!* - just thought I should say that
Every rhyme is like a time bomb strapped beneath your Maybach
Cop the range, stop the strange, lock the game, rock the chain
Stop the train, smoke a fag, pop your brain
Unless you can inject me in your arm like a narcotic and squeeze
Please never say my name in vain, let's go",https://genius.com/Pharoahe-monch-scream-lyrics
God Send,Internal Affairs,1999.0,"My mom is in the bedroom, crying again
Sister's on the street corner, lying again
Just heard about another one of my niggas dying again
I'm trying again to make moves
I'll be damned if we go hungry
Ever since my pops passed, the responsibilities belonged to me
This song you see is like an ode to God
That he blessed my last breath to be Allahu Akbar
And this city is hard, tenement buildings are barred
Incarcerated and scarred, no sentiment for when it becomes time for war
I'm trying to score like Bernard King
My vocal box sling verbal cocaine like the government
I told you I'd hurt the music
Travelling back, busting shots at (*gunshots*) before Christ was persecuted
Mathematically, we live at right angles
Fuck the Star Spangled, the mayor's the fallen angel
Dangling from moon crescents, I persevere, breathe the air
Inhale the effervescence of life
This street game is stifling I'm trifling, upholding a rifle
Peering from behind the eyes of God, we at odds with ourselves
What is it worth when this barren metropolis prevail?
Scale the walls of hell, trail of a octopus

I've seen it all through the eyes of a needle
Depletion of the planet, brainwash of the people
Niggas'll never learn (Shit) we just concerned about
Who's fucking who, when time is of significance
Ghost, we disregard the most magnificent
Eat of the fruit that is poisonous and lethal
Stuck in the crux of the spell with the evil
Credits about to roll and hell is the sequel

Incarcerated Scarfaces in all places
Crack sales rise, failed lives, cops and robber car chases
Y2K fuck up, you're left faceless
Hustlers bury money in Garcia Vega cigar cases
Give the drummer some pianos, guitar basses
Trumpet in tune, Pharoahe and Prince legitimate reasons for why they thumping
Hi, I'm the most endangered species
By all means, survival is what I teach these
First time offenders catching seven to fifteen
Now my vision of life is hell and heaven on split screen
Bust your shit like Mitch Greene (Snitch), I switch scenes
Bring drama to that ass, that's how we on it in Queens (What?)
Stray bullets continue shattering dreams, battering spleens
I'm gathering schemes, had only cream just as bad as a fiend
Take food from a table and get drunk to your death
Now feel it in your heart from the love in my breath

I've seen it all through the eyes of a needle
Depletion of the planet, brainwash of the people
Niggas'll never learn (Shit) we just concerned about

Yeah, uh

Call me the hitman, it's kind of hard, ain't it?

So I painted a masterpiece of an industry tainted
It's not a lithograph, so it's graphic, frame it
The hitman (Say it again)
The hitman
The hitman (Uh, say it again, say, say)
The hitman

Some people say I'm extreme
Broadcast a beam live through a meme
Screaming as Jimmy Iovine, as corrupt as Don King
Boxed into the ghetto to be champions of bling
Industry's the arena, the internet is the ring
You train audible queens to sling music to fiends?
Then Def Jam, supreme team, the same thing
Except more critical now, it's digital cocaine
The goal to control every individual's brain, like
Cadillacs for contracts in the 60's
Now it's rap 'til you 60 for contract 360s
The trick, switch the degrees with the three sixes
Artists are left with zero, you know who receives the riches
Which is the reason why there's only a few moguls
Globally, the pioneers are left in a chokehold
Enough to make an individual go postal
Watching these old folks get fucked for their vocals

Call me the hitman, it's kind of hard, ain't it?
What most feared we'd become in the game, we became it
So I painted a masterpiece of an industry tainted
It's not a lithograph, so it's graphic, frame it

If you are not performing fellatio for radio rotation
What's the ratio for radio play at your station?
If you're not paying to play, the record is dead
Puts a whole new spin on Radiohead
They got a thousand plays a week and we selling the same units
Put their best rep up, they couldn't stand next to it
People wanna relate, they wanna connect to it
Here's a lyrical check, is this enough for you to flex to it?
Huh? Or do you need more clues?
Should I be more black, would that change your view?
Should I dye my hair blond, should my eyes be blue?
Just a couple of questions I mustered up for you
But these eleven-and-a-half shoes, you can't fill those
I make headlines like corduroy pillows
And probably get banned from television and marketing
Targeting music industry politics, provocative

The hitman, it's kind of hard, ain't it?
What most feared we'd become in the game, we became it
So I painted a masterpiece of an industry tainted

The hitman (Say it again, say it, uh)

It's kind of hard
Let's release sex tapes so we can become stars
Nude photographs of titties and asses
Increase our buzz, impress the masses
I thought she was supposed to be so passive
Now you just another ass in the end with an asterisk
Cellphone songs, you will never be classic
You sold your soul, they call that remastering
See, why does it have to be so drastic?
Chemical skin peel makes the song more plastic
Follow the program, man, stick to the tactics
Twelve to eighteen, you know the demographics
These kids want popcorn, they want slapstick
Probably the chorus goes 'tisket, tasket'
But I'm not willing to risk it and mask it
This might take a couple of listens for you to grasp it

They take the strongest of slaves to compete in a track meet
For the king of the city sang songs of back streets
Choruses of cocaine tales and black heat
Only to trade niggas like professional athletes
Don't take that merchandising, snatch that publishing
Package that black ass, ship you to London

I'll peep the future in my sleep, to be honest, man

Bring it on if you think you can hang
Represent one time, time, time

May I have your attention, please?
What you are about to hear is undoubtedly
The most incredible MC of the year
No-no-no-no, no wait, no please, no wait, no listen, um
All that I wish to do is to display
A brand new rendition of style that I have
It'll only take a moment of your time, four minutes!
Then it will be beneficial when it is replenished
But then again, you might never return
To the shit you're hearing on the radio get burned
I have a dream, one day we will get to the promised land
Then the president will be me
The government will be Shabaam, Mos and Kweli, that's it
All wackness is now banned, obtain access through retina scans
Voice verification enhancement, the man who moves his hand
And will motion light detect you
For genetic confirmation, DNA verification
Access: Pharaoahe; Codename: 13
Residence: Southside, Queens; Armed and dangerous and 

Smack the nigga in the mouth, stabbed his mother in the eyeball
I brawl like Mike Tys' in his prime
My advice, you think twice before you grime
'Cause I'll wink once (one time), your bitch is mine
'Cause she's feeling the flow, best believe I'm drilling the hole
Heads high, kill 'em with the low
Revealing, chilling, filling up position to be killing the show
Stopping 'em on top feeling, plus I'm grilling the dough
For a couple of million or so, I'll be willing to blow
Pharoahe's a chameleon
A million niggas are feeling 'em on the low
Every syllable of mine is an umbilical cord through time
For the sick typical niggas who choose to pick pitiful rhymes
Spit, shit, it's more dimes to get
More higher levels of spirituality to reach
And I'm trying to win

Smash any splitter or fastball, that'll be it

Triggering a rigorous amount of energy
That'll be definitely needed, defeat a foe who retreated back
See no need to repeat it, permission to shine
Stop this and rewind that back

You run up on him without a gun, I run up on 'em

Kill like the one syllable word
The criminal of the lyrical killing you pitiful
Niggas leaving you in a critical, destroying your mineral
Back when I was scrambling in front of the deli
Live on a celly, which was in a street whipping on shiny Pirelli
Now every millisecond I try to reckon with niggas for jacking
Like they really thugging, I ain't even checking
How niggas could try to act like they really them foul niggas
Fucking with now niggas, better bow, niggas
For moderation niggas going to hibernation
While I legally chase the situation of hyper nation
Now that we credible, I require a busy schedule
Collecting federals, being put on a pedestal
While we clean and we keep on your feeding, you know the meaning
Start to holler and screaming until your stomach start bleeding

The next millennium rap now everybody listen
Condition yourself to be knocked out of commission
Watch out, 'cause this is a new world transmission

Her apartment was wallpapered in 2Pac posters
She used playing cards as coasters
Rusted pipe cockroaches
Voted most likely to succeed
They was right all she do now is suck-seeds
Clutch-clit, suck-dick while she puff weed
In the bathroom, bandaids for her scuffed knees
With her hand chop a mountain down, you know where her nose at
Running where them hookers and them hoes at
Before the Paxil and the Prozac
She used to beg a nigga for the bozac
Now all I ever hear is where the doughs at?
The prada bags, Clothes at
Took my heart, froze that
Promised that if I opened it up it would never close back
It was a love so solid
Plans to deliver the ring like Frodo the Hobbit
But you cut me off like Lorena Bobbit
On some bullshit, when we was just getting started
And I can see it inside your face I'm in your space
Right people just need to move at they're on pace
But my advantage is, Seven spiritual laws and anger management
Seven spiritual laws and anger management
Seven spiritual laws and

Pundit she was fear to control emotions so I'm done with
I reveal a force field for nonsense in my circumference
While we waste resources in abundance
Seventeen-thousand times a day the human eye blinks
Making us even more subjectable to the hijinks
Home alone in my iPad, iPhone, iThink
One world currency, doesn't matter where I bank
There is no pot of gold at the end of a mythical rainbow
We're uneducated contestants, life is the game show
The president is the host, the results are painful
The judges weave a web in which we all get tangled
Their only contribution to the world is a delusion
Which has no physical power, I offer you a solution
Pharoahe Monch, the antonym for translucent
Lyrical revolution, I'll expose the movement

Look man, do not get my block pissed, we'll blast your brain
Two-hundred-thousand dollar 
whips and chains
Crooked cops, Crips, crack cocaine
2Pac, Chris, I'm still feelin' the pain
Seven-year-old girl, shot and slain? What does it all mean?
We go insane
 in the struggle
The stress make him add panic
We're I'm from, we do not eat organic (Talk about it)
You see, my mama can not afford Whole Foods
She break fast for the bread, call it soul food
Where I come from — let it breathe
Where I come from, no one runs when funds run low in lump sums
We chose to dump dumb dumb bullets (Dun, dun)
We livin' hum-drum in the slums where scum conceal stun guns
The word's mum for fun, son, conundrums ain't pretty
In this cesspool called New York Shitty
I call it that 'cause it smell like shit
Walk around hunchbacked or you might get hit (Talk about it)
I knew a nigga sold crack to his moms
That same motherfucker sold crack to his kid
Lookin' like three-hundred comin' back from his bid
Like, ""Pharoahe, let's get this money for real""

He said, ""Pharoahe, let's get this money up""
What the fuck? What, you need me to holla at Steve Rifkin?
Hit him, escape from New York like Snake Plissken
I told you from the gate that you needed more marketing
And these major labels are not listenin'
Stood in a b-boy stance, teeth glistenin'
From the gold in his mouth, the summer breeze was whistlin'
I contemplated my retort, eyes fixed in
On a crucifix around his neck, I guess he was Christian
Just then, the police siren had pitched in
To the soundtrack of the hood, so I spoke with conviction
Spoke as if I was 6'10"" with thick skin
Put a little bass in my voice like pitch bend
'Cause where I come from
Where I come from, we all come from
Sky, moon, the stars, the earth and sun
Multiple skin tones, your blood is one
The pen is the ammo to my automatic gun
Bring to fruition what I write to get me out of the slums
And I'ma shine, sh-sh-shine, shine, shine
Shine like the sun, the world is mine
Each line of speech designed to transcend time
And reach the unborn to transform your mind
And I'ma shine, shine

 Jesus Christ, who is it?!?!
 Officer Fleming!
 Come in! Hey, good morning, how ya doin?
 Good morning Your Honor
 Want a donut?
 Uhh, no thank you
 What are you doin with that shotgun * last two words slow down *
* a burst of gunshots *

And so it was that I had shot him, several times in the head
Mount Sinai, 6:15, pronounced dead
The news reporter said the assailaints fled the city
Meanwhile I'm shacked across the street, in some
Shitty-ass hotel, waitin til things get a little quiet
Dunn I could try to bounce, but now why should I even try it?
The riot that ensued, I viewed bird's-eye
Fifteen floors up behind the curtains in the nude
Took three-hundred and sixty-five to get close to him
Boast to him, roast, when I put the toast to him
Dangerous, the most heinous crimes have been committed
Through painless means, more famous lives have been acquitted
To hell he went, bent, sent, government issues
With my initial in print, ah, we'll never miss you
In the streets, understanding that you made it hard to eat
Complete the cypher, or, make ends meet
Twenty-five years my father spent hard labor you suspended him
From the force, placed his head beneath the pendulum
Periphreal vision now, doorknob shiftin
Optical illusion or the coke that I'm sniffin
Think, primal instinct, maybe it's me
Hit the lights must hit the floor simul-taneously
Seems as though this is manifested through some amazin dream
Dazed cops entered the room with guns and lazer beams
For days it seems we blast at, one another
Bullets hit the chest of this, black undercover
My last minutes on earth, drop say a prayer
Fuck it if I'm gonna die at least I shot the Mayor!
I feel, pain and sorrow
My heart's, hard and hollow
I can't go on, to see tomorrow (2X)

Walked out the room staggerin, dagger in my back
Dazed wagglin my leg, imagin I'm not afraid
Grazed and bruised, amazed at who's surroundin
Cop guns, cocked back, SWAT teams, astoundin
From rooftops, troops Glock to smack my melon
Felon, Seargenat yellin for me to come out like Ellen
Propellin walked through the lobby and the front door
Packin hand grenades and strapped with C-4
The more swine, the merrier, Harrier jets overhead
Ready to riddle my body with bullets of lead
A dead man walking, destination devil's lair
Fuck it if I'm gonna die at least I shot the Mayor!
I feel, pain and sorrow
My heart's, hard and hollow
I can't go on, to see tomorrow
Ooh, I've, gone too far
Can, turn, back no more
Hell.. open your door!!!!!!",https://genius.com/Pharoahe-monch-mayor-lyrics

I want my goddamn money
In 24 hours you better have my money
I got bills and shit, I need medicine
Roof over my head, Con Edison
I need it

In '99 I caught a case for a rhyme, rape charge
Cut a Klansman's face, slashed his throat with the race card
Lyrically intergalactic
When I arrange to properly wait between my words, spacebars
Don't make me show you pictures of your daughter's grade school location
Your teenager goes to Queens Vocational
You? Wall Street occupation
Me? I'll occupy Wall Street like the protest just to discuss interest rates and inflation
Not stocks and bonds, but
Contusions and knots, fractions and blood coagulation
My medication is next to go
But I'ma get it out of Canada or Mexico
I need cash in hand with extra dough
For my albuterol and my Lexapro
Give me my money

Give me my motherfucking money
I want my goddamn money
In 24 hours you better have my money
I got bills and shit, I need medicine
Roof over my head, Con Edison

Scratch a match, burn that bitch for clownin' with Jamal
Taxiderm that bitch and mount him on the wall (Okay)

All you gon' hear is that nine clickin'
I'm tryna get rich or die tryin'
Got my niggas speakin' to my son like
Don't worry, Claude, you gon' get them Sneakers

That's what a nigga get for fuckin' with them leeches (Oh)
Could've furnished your crib with all the deluxe features (Oh)
Captain underground, you are just a lieutenant (Nigga)
I'm a Brownsvillain with a chest full of ribbons (Nigga)
It was 23 hours and a couple minutes
I threw that bird into a safe, she had my money plus interest

Give me my motherfuckin' money
I want my goddamn money

Extended 'em out, defendin' em with linear raps when enbalmin' em
Bendin em back, blendin' em with miraculous type

Uhh, don't even bother gotta lotta cats who swallow
For dollar raps scholar holla back like a Rockwilder
Me get ya hit ya split ya open, sit you down
Get you in the ring, sling slang boxing rounds with ya
Snap your bone gristle, Crystal motel
Queens missle pistol-whip you army issue shouldn't fuck with you
Or get niggas like Yusef, you're useless
Attack back, smack your whole team toothless
Now welcome to the New York Knicks
Where Averex are the jerseys and the boots are the kicks
Y'all on the dick the way we pose for the flicks
Queens style, Redhook now all in the mix


P, pass the baton, we mashin' whatever crew want Sahdeeq
Black on tracks like Dutch flashbacks
Settle the score, make y'all know for sure
That what we, bring to the table your mental'll digest
Put away your forks, can't eat these MC's
Just as, hungry as you, hungry as you
Snatch it our your hand before you bite or chew, we're inviting you
To spar, with the likes of this two, got you spillin' your brew
Intercept your soundwave, bitch!
Hijack your frequency quick, and bang our shit
Motivated to make it but foes try to block flows
Knock those, crush 'em like a bag of nachos
Keep em on they toe, word up, like ballet
You sweet sap suckers get served like cafes
You candy cats melt in my pockets like Milky Ways
Southside, BK hurtin' niggas for days


 Blow it up with incredible landmine rhymes
 Federal crime for sure, THIRD WORLD WAR
 Weight on my back like Atlas, our tactics
To hem 'em like denim and pin their back to the canvas

Blow up they barracks with a C-4 brick

'Cause you sound like you wasn't born inside the Empire State""

But you're popular, so I'm not secure""

Battin' her eyelashes, finaglin' her baby arm
And all up in my space, next day, I'm on her MySpace top eight
We contemplating a hot date
Got poolside flicks for the cool fly blogs
With the rules I kicked about the yuletide logs
And she like low-cut jeans with the real high clogs
And dig music so much, she got two iPods
I'm tryna make it to third base like A-Rod
Threw a couple of Guinness stout back just to stay

I'm tryna get horizontal like yesterday, she say

Dust crush competition, lights out like the Clapper
The mic ripper, whip a nigga like a slave
Separate him from him from his fam, he don't know how to behave
Now, drag his ass, bag dun for his loot
Figure me to give a nigga-y twenty-one gun salute
That's seven shots for 2Pac
Seven for Biggie Smalls
Seven for Freaky Tah up in your neighborhood malls
How's that, fat action packed rap remain tame

Or find your picture of your autoposy up on the web site
Yo if you ever violate my space
Fuck a fat lip, I'll leave you wit a fuckin fat face
Nigga, Busta Rhymes the handsome, I'll hold you for ransom ansom
Like the ghost in a haunted house, I'll forever live in a mansion
Bitches, snitches comin out and you know who's showin it
Like when British civil servants pass secrets to the Soviets

Live on about ? ? on a bunch of seamless ends

Respondin, to a domestic dispute, the culprit
A younger monkey who went ape-shit and decided to shoot
His older brother in the brain
His baby's mother couldn't refrain
Keepin sex out the family name
And that keeps me smiling like racial profiling
Forever nigga pilin inside Rikers Island
New York's most violent, black wall of silence
React with black talons when wolfpacks are wyling
For a white cat, gotta admit I can rap-ta-tat-tat
My nightstick, on the top of your cap
My blackjack you'll be swallowing for protestin and hollering
The policy is quality of life and zero tolerance

What is the law? Know you heard this before
We find contraband in your car, we breakin your jaw
What is the law? Nigga, mathematics for sure
If they walkin in packs of four, they tryin to score
For any - drug bust or cocaine that's raw
Better believe we takin our twenty percent at the door
What is the law? Wolfpacks, movin on all fours
I'm flawless with weaponry, mentally ready for war

Any formalities in the case of police brutality
I've escaped on finer details and minor technicalities
Here's a verbal medley of deadly force used
Readily abused in that old Ku Kluk pedigree
You better be heavily armed, forever we ready your song
Steadily ready to move and bomb
I'm like - Hercules, when I work my knees
It's a - search and seize that'll hurt indeed
God bless when the bullets hit the chest you'll backflip
SWAT - Special Weapons And Tactics; theatrics hot
On your block we lock down all shenanigans
When we roll you stand stiff like mannequins
Take the position for broomstick penetration (uh)

Madden 2002 Theme,UnKnown,2001.0,"* theme for Madden 2002 on Playstation 2

Unravel the world of John Madden 2002
Y'all playas need to switch up ya offensive patterns
Before they break from the huddle, I read their thoughts
Pharoahe Monch, hail mary, EA Sports
The defense impregnable, plays all legible
The tolerance to withstand pain is un-measurable
Heat, rain, snow, sleet, hail
You leave it all on the field and you're bound to prevail
The All-Madden free safety tracking ya pass
We hate artificial surface, love natural grass
Don't let my squad get to whippin' on ya natural ass
The agony of defeat it's all factual
Frustration (Come on), aggrevation
On the sideline when I'm pumpin' my fist in celebration
I thirst for first downs, I burst through the middle
Jiggle a bit, give em' some speed before they hit you
Who's standing still at the end of two-minute drill
Who has the heart to win it all, who has the will
John Madden 2002
Pharoahe Monch about to bring it to you, I'm saying
John Madden, EA Sports
Y'all better play hard don't take no shorts
Say, John Madden, EA Sports
Y'all better play hard don't take no shorts

You are now rocking with the phenom phenomenal

So hiyya hiyya heyy
We gon' rock it all night and all day and get crazy

Yea

This is not a popular pop hit for the populous
This is Doctor Octopus mixed with the innocuous
Six pictures that depict the apocalypse
Pictures of a mosh pit in a fallen metropolis
The karma of a kamikaze pilot without binoculars
Probably like an oxy to paparazzi photographers
You are a carbon copy, a mockery of this rock shit
I should probably just pop you in the back of the head and watch you

Thirteen! You know the X is for anonymous
Feels like I'm in the prime of my life but not Rodimus

'Cause radio can suck my dick
And Wall Street can lick my balls

Slap him in a contraption and smack him 'til he's collapsing
Specially these backward rappers from New York who be acting like they're immaculate with the raps but don't really be living the trapping life
Remove his organs then utilize as a sacrifice
Now ya favorite rapper's a mutilated hermaphrodite
Saved him like a pastor then booted him to the afterlife
Executed, electrocuted him with a catheter
Attach it to back of a battery then blasted via satellite
And let the whole wide world witness
The gradual decapitation of a rapper with an exact-o knife
The massive massacre of actors that aren't acting right

'Cause radio can suck my dick
And Wall Street can lick my balls
'Cause it's all about the 1%, let it burn

Please ease my soul
Or I'm gon' get me a gun

They're burning crucifixes on my lawn again (Lawn again)
They wanna hang a nigga like an ornament
It's tormenting, mourning over yesterday, still yawning
Inside of a tournament I can't win (Good Morning!)
Shotgun blast passed by my head
""I'm a man, I tell you, I'm a man"", I said (I'm a man, I'm a man)
Push my daughter and my wife in the closet and slid my son up under the bed
Filled the Smith & Wesson with lead
Looked in the mirror, said ""Breathe"" (""Now, c'mon""), ""Breathe""
I'm bout to bring six Klansmen to their knees
A cold story that my old man told me
If you're wondering why I have so much pent up hostility
Inside of my soul and the memory still molds me (Still molds me)
Just take a glimpse into the mind of a O.G. (Where?)
Underneath the oak tree in the shade where I hang at (Why?)
That's the same spot my great gran used to hang at

Long line of alcoholics in the fam (Long line)
My man gave me work and I sat up on the strip and got knocked
A long line of homies in the can (Long line)
Jail is the shit that don't sail that hold the slaves
And the judge have you askin' for bail like it's the waves (Like that's the waves)
Meanin' the slave even pays to be caged in (Damn), which is motherfuckin' insane (Now that's insane)
It's like we pickin' cotton again
Forty-fives and Klansmen, shit is rotten again (It's rotten)
They gave us AIDS, gave us crack, now they plottin' again (Look at 'em)
That boy ran, so they shot him, then they shot him again (That's sad)
The same shit, make the tissue new (Make it)
Four hundred years, let's make the issues new (Come on, y'all)

I'm about to grab my gun, shit is critical (I'ma grab my gun)

Lyrical phenom, an enigma
Light years and eons; beyond
What you comprehend through modern day radio and television
Servers, I pee on, like R-Kelly women
In the limelight I’m primetime like Deion
Through the fog I shine like X-5 Xenon
Pharoahe Monch as a Sphinx
Probably thinking more along the lines of Spinks like Leon
I’m on some queen shit, (c’mon) I’m on some queen shit, (c’mon)
You fuck around and get your faggot-ass spleen split
When on the mic, I’m not the type to intervene wit’
Jamaican house pays the  I mean shit
I slash half assed rappers in the face,] and leave deep gashes
I’m Hot!
Give me room to rock, I give heat rash
This the beat bastards?
The master flow Jurassic
Walking over water and drinking forties on acid
The masses know the name alone agreed to blast it in the brains
Disastrous, leave them battered and flabbergasted
Multiple clashes with a hazardous man
Whose hand crafted rap thrashes theirs
Your honor, I’ve seen past it
My aura's like a vorous
Rappers need a thesaurus
Pharoahe put fire to that ass like menorahs
And your chorus is bound to pull us
Need to learn, it's my turn

Jungle Freestyle (Tim Westwood),UnKnown,2001.0," What up Pharoahe?
 -What up Talib? What's the deal, what we doin'? UK style-
 I heard you got some rhymes...
 -Yeah yeah, check me out now, Pharoahe Monch, Queens representin' one time, Brooklyn in da house
 That's how we do it, how we do it, how we do it... (like music~)

You see them gorillas over there in the park? -They my niggas, after dark we spark up and pull triggers
You gotta talk Urang Utan slang and pull capers, the cops are the cheetahz in the trees or the sky scrapers
Speakin' of jungle we often rumble for loot, some of us just stumble around, Hi to boo - Pfsshoo
You'll get shot, shit, play humble like last year when a white man tried to capture my uncle
When you come through you can get bumped too if you don't got at least four-five gorillas amongst you
The bigotry here will shock and amaze, .41 shot is hot, about and ablaze
If not, they ship your ass to the Bronx in a cage, and to the Island when you spend your time countin' the days
But still acting vulture-ly, this kinda ill, we blow mills, they make a killin' and build new landz in the jungle

Yo, one time in tha place to be, the illest niggas you'll hear on the BBC
A lot of cats like to get on the microphone and front, steady rollin' the paper like they ran outta blunts
Tell you how much they sound scared of the month
The man tells you to jump, you threw it - we'll never let the man take advantage of us
You get props off the diamonds you rented, I get my props for the rhymes I invented, cause I spoke my mind and I meant it
Like Tae Bo with a bowtie, kick yo' ass with class, and I still take it to Brooklyn when I'm ready to splash
Me and Hi-Tek got shit ready to blast, I'm never ready to last, I stay hungry like I'm ready to fast
Married to the movement like a Betty (Shabazz?)
A rhyme veteran, you actin' a real bitch right now, like a... lesbian thesbian
So let me in the pack, I've been dropping jewels, plugged in like pasta noodles, and stayin' fresh and clean like hospitals
In the world of Chris Poppins, big wallet to wrist watchin'
You ever think your wrist watch is watching you? -That's why the cops is stoppin' you?
Nigga please, they can track you anywhere, through cell phones transmitting radiation through your ear
A two way is way too new and obsolete next year, navigational system shows you how to get there
If you ain't thinkin' 'bout how you got here then do you know where you are?
What happened today, well back in the day they used to follow the stars
I distilled it so much you need to catch it in bottles and jars and make emcees eat their words and swollow their bars
Oh my god...

Yeah yeah y'all, Last Emp y'all, check it out y'all, bust it-
Yo, Last Emp is in da house, now don't y'all go trippin'
I break rappers up like Tom Cruise - Nicole Kidman, hijack a Concorde jet full of gold shipments
Animalistic rapper that is known for throat rippin'
A lot of people know me as the Great Pretender, a college graduate and a gang member
But ever since then I been tryin' to convince y'all that I'm just a robot that was built by Prince Paul
You know you heard the voice before somewhere, and when I said I was the Emp, you said ""Oh, yeah!""
""That brother who dissed the CIA with Kris, so he's nice!""
Ow yeah, y'all know what time it is
What it is? I got a style that's mentally powerdriven, a symbol of these interesting times that we live in
Now listen close, as the best explanation is given, while parents enjoyin' them lyrics I be kickin' to the children:
I'm raw hardcore but easy on the violence, the perfect combination of sorcery and science
Uh, you know another rapper, tell him not to try it, and look at me as this 21st century tyrant
Who controls the mic like helicopter pilot, a man on small knees with the power to drop a giant
With fans of all ages; ""Children, run out to buy it! Batteries not included, some assembly required""
Like that y'all, it's like that y'all
Ayo, Westwood drop it, and keep it animated just like Wallace and Grommit
Like that y'all, it's like that y'all, it's like that-at-at-that, ayo we can't fall, Rawkus y'all


(Last Emp and Pharoahe can't stop laughing)
 Okay, here we go, I need the headphones man...
What up Pharoahe?
 -You got it Talib, do your thing
 Alright... Yo-yo-yo-yo-yo, I needa come up wit' some new rhymes, aight let's do this one... (laughs)

I don't know what to say so I'mma freestyle, I let my cats get busy in the meanwhile
I got my man Chaps, he represent the Shark Body, we come to Jam In The Park and we rock the whole party
I got my girl singing background
Yo, if you got my album you gotta put it back down on the turntable
Ayo, I burn... stable nigga, ayo I come through, you just like fable niggas
(Aesop?), Ayo peep the way that I rock, I come through like Long Island on a (???)
Ayo I come though like Long Island with the (???), ayo you know how I do it when I drop
Like a bomb, like Flexican Westwood, y' know it's all good, we all from the hood
Like we do it, yo I ain't... checkin' for you nerds, yo I'm dark like cigar reserve
Yo the way I drop my bars, all the cars don't swerve
Goin' the wrong way, I go... long way... from the express way... My way...
I'm just buggin', y'all like my cousin or my fam
Give me a slap on the black hand side, come through yo, hop back in the ride
Take it back to Brooklyn, the Melting Pot was cookin', you could tell it was hot when they overcrowded Central Booking
Everytime you lookin', cats took it for they jewelery, African-Asian-Jewish communities
Yo, lyrics so deep that it reads like a eulogy, yo you die - don't ever get confusing me
Ayo, this is how we do it, ancient like (Truarts?) when we flowin' like fluid
Yo, we rockin' over the beat as Erick's on the music
Yo, we come through, it's the truest, yo we on...
Yo... I'm just buggin', yo I said that three times but I got three rhymes, it's like I got three minds the way I come with ill lines
Ayo, my man Pharoahe is one of a kind
Last Emp, he from Philly in the 2-1-5
I'm from the 7-18, and I keeps it live
On radio 1, I only just begun like Jimmy Castor, catch me in The Village chillin' on Astor, yo, it goes like Casper, after the rhyme...",https://genius.com/Pharoahe-monch-jungle-freestyle-tim-westwood-lyrics

So much pain, it's never the pain of a migraine
But the pain of a million slaves slain
And they speak to me, God talks through me
If I'm offending your religion or race, now sue me
Are these the profound words of a prophet for sure?
Does Christopher Wallace play chess with 2Pac Shakur?
We're on the other side of lost souls cryin'
My third eye relies on faith, I keep fire lights
Spirit slash math, on a path to Mount Zion
Hexcel, blow the bell-horse to keep ridin'
My thoughts psychotic at times, who will support it?
Will I ever discuss life with my seed that was aborted?
Does my spirit gets absorbed in a tape when they record it
That's the reason why emcees' lives get shorted
Salvation's worth more than platinum and gold, can you afford it?
It's morbid but I manifest pain and put it in orbit

I said it's morbid
It's like the other day
I just took the gun from underneath the bed
And... put the barrel to my head
I was just too afraid to pull the trigger, I...
You know it...
 
You know it's pain
When you can't see the sun from the rain
You know it's pain
When there's fire in your eyes and you can't see

Respect, even if you were ashes you couldn't earn
I embody antibiotics, you are infected with germs
Rap's fatally ill, please stick to the serum
Players, pick turns to play, get burned

Just get in 'em, then I renovate

One false move might just shift me
If I'm in-lodged and your soul's not claimed
I'll remind that ass when it's about to rain like


Would the new method of murder be arson or firebombs?
If the cost of a single bullet was more than the firearm
Strange that is, when all exists are final
Point blank range that is
My attitude is cold and callus
Killed Kings in Tennessee
Presidents in Dallas
And if the past be known, at last we know
What happened that afternoon on the Grassy Knoll
It's what made a widow of Jackie O
The government hired Lee Harvey to blast me though
Fatality shot entered from the right temple
Was not fired from a six-story window
Can it be that it was all so simple
But yet remains so painful to rekindle
I come through your city I'm hot
Whether you're jiggy or not
Whether your Biggie or 'Pac

Never Walk Alone,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Scene one, The opening shot
We pan across prostitution and crime
This view through the eyes of a child that seen 365 eight times
Pops is scared, the proverbial definition of this __ kid
His mom works _______ things to the bone
48 __ us some she never at home
But she light that ass up, catch that ass lying
Honey with the ____ real cheese with the iron
Screams with the sirens, the murder scenes
It seems his life ____ to one block __ and the gun shots
Plays in the shadows, no need for sun block
Take the heat to Queens last stop, you can come watch
He's intelligent, clever, however
Foot at the bed ______ hands together
He prays, ""Father, if you're truly the father
____ wishfull Father""

Same Shit Different Toilet,UnKnown,2020.0,"Peace! (Peace y'all!)
I can't call it, same shit, different toilet
When will the struggle end?
Square one, we're back again
I'm about to lose control (What up)
Please ease my soul
Or I'm gon' kick me a drum

The burning crucifix is on my lawn again
They wanna hang a nigga like an ornament, it's tormenting
Mourning over yesterday, still yawning
Inside of a tournament, I can't win (Good morning!)
Shotgun blast, passed by my head
I'm a man, I tell you, I'm a man, I said
Push my daughter and my wife in the closet
And slid my son under the bed
Fill the Smith & Wesson with lead
Looked in the mirror and said ""Breath!"" (Now come on!)
Breath! I'm about to bring six klansmen to their knees
A cold story that my Oldman told me
If you're wondering why I have so much pimped up hostility
Inside of my soul and my memory still molds me 
Just take a glimpse into the mind of an OG (Where?)
Underneath the oak tree in the shade, where I hang at (Why?)
That's the same spot my great grand used to hang at

Peace! (Peace y'all!)
I can't call it, same shit, different toilet
When will the struggle end?
Square one, we're back again
I'm about to lose control (What up)
Please ease my soul
Or I'm gon' kick me a drum

Agent Orange (clean),UnKnown,UnKnown,"(Hook 1)
Please lord forgive me for my sins
My life is all I have to give
Please lord forgive me for my sins
My life is all I have to give
Damn you that lost the will to live
(Verse 1)
Pissed on the motherf**king White House lawn
I threw a rock (Iraq), then I ran (Iran)
Cause I couldn't stand anymore within the grips of the man
Y'all wanna ask me who's sane (Hussein)
These biological gasses are eating my brain
Its a political grab bag to rape mother earth
Thirty seconds after they bagged dad (Baghdad) for what he's worth
Thousands will die now so millions can smile later
This ain't the +Rockford Files+ nigga
They stockpile data for satellites
Where you discuss who's style is greater
In this killing pool you playing it cool like Cal Tjader
When ya'll ready to rock like Led Zep and Al Qaeda
With weapons of mass destruction an hour later
What's your identidy today?
You on some John F. Kennedy or Timothy McVeigh?
This Henessy done left me with a remedy to spray
For my identity your life is the penalty to pay
Motherf**ker

Damn you that lost the will to live
Trapped in the game
Just tryin to win (3x)
(Verse 2)
Its not a Vietnam song
I know women from desert storm who came back deformed
Missin limbs and diseases in they legs and arms
Chemicals twice as strong as agent orange
Its messages in the bass drum
War goin off in your mind
No man is safe from
Its not a Game Boy, Xbox, the PlayStation
Its +Resident Evil+ when every President's a mason
Robbin (Robin) y'all fools like Dick Grayson
And y'all inherited roots and don't know how to retrace them
Place them back
Face them facts
Disgraceful, faceless, tasteless acts
Pharoahe takes teh authorities to court
Peep crime before it happens like +Minority Report+
And I will never be mentally defenseless
Cats be on the block, in the hood in the trenches sayin

Freestyle About Addiction at the Bars Lab,UnKnown,2016.0,"They told me to see the glass half full
'Cause some see it as half empty
I chose to see the glass as twice the size it needed to be
Smashed it against the wall i the kitchen
On the floor, going through withdrawals, I was itchin'
But she rescued mme, my heroine to the end
Then she morphed into heroin in a syringe
Around my bicep, I would tie a shoestring—tap!
Five times to find a vein in there
Squeeze seven CCs, so I could see the seven seas
And CC all my friends, so they could see what I was seeing
But what they saw was a despicable human being
So, I guess they just wasn't seeing what I was seeing
Convert two into one, and an invisible plan
To discover what dreams may come for this invisible man
Sentimental education
Beautiful, but the damned was constantly catching fire
Richard Pryor!
My skin deteriorated
Family infuriated by the myriad of tracks
But my train never came
So humiliated, started begging for change
Failed rehabilitation, so the scars still remain
Nice clothes became frayed
So isolated and afraid
Smelled like an animal, my teeth enamel decayed
And I'm relocated in Alabama, now
I'm on that Maalox and Mylanta, now
But it won't stop the burn
Constantly searching for the answers
How I could kiss the sky without enhancing
But it's just so hard to learn",https://genius.com/Pharoahe-monch-freestyle-about-addiction-at-the-bars-lab-lyrics
