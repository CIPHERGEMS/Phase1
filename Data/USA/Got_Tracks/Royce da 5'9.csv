Caterpillar,Book of Ryan,2018.0,"You will not be able to stay home, brotha
You will not be able to plug in, turn on and cop out
You will not be able to lose yourself on skag and skip out for beer during commercials
Because the revolution will not be televised

This right here for the number one
Number ones here with your number one
You ain't number one, just another one
Now everybody sayin' that they number one

Ring the alarm, the caterpillar keeps firing
Ohh, we in the war, where butterflies keep dyin' (ahh)

I'm a product of Parker Lewis and Kubiak
If I didn't do this, where in the fuck would you be at?
See there's a difference between us, what I spit hit arenas
You a drip from my penis, I eat lions and sip hyenas
You number one when it come to slaughtering mics
I'm tryna be number one in my son and daughter life
Uhh, all you niggas my little rapper babies
Y'all my children, y'all bit my shit and contracted rabies
Don't you grade me next to these rappers, baby, that's degrading
My style got so many different facets
I switch into so many different passions
I'm skippin' class to be fascinatin'
My pen is like Big Ben, this shit's just a classic waiting
Your favorite rapper come at me, I just decapitate him
I hate congratulating these has-beens who had their highs
These rappers only won their matches because they strategize
I bring Attica to these patterns, and here's my battle cry

Ring the alarm, the caterpillar is firing
Ohh, we in the war, where butterflies keep dyin' (ahh)

This right here for the number one
Number ones here with your number one
You ain't number one, just another one
Now everybody sayin' that they number one
Kid think your number won't quit
Number one song, get your number one chick
Number one fly with your number one kick
When it's all done then your number gon' switch

Hold up, wait a minute
Guess what I'ma never do? Show so much respect to you
That I feel like we're friends, so now we no longer competitors
That could be the death of you
Never let someone who's not as smart as you
Gas you up and tell you somethin' you never knew
Always stay professional, you always gon' make revenue
Don't let people next to you that don't want the best for you
It's completely normal to hold on to a regret or two
I do what I wanna do, they do what I let them do
Everything these niggas be sayin' is a fuckin' lie
It's nothing I can say to you that is realer
Remember when you praisin' the butterfly
Don't you ever disrespect the fuckin' caterpillar

This right here for the number one
Number ones here with your number one
You ain't number one, just another one
Now everybody sayin' that they number one
Kid think your number won't quit
Number one song, get your number one chick
Number one fly with your number one kick
When it's all done then your number gon' switch

You're looking at Attila, the psychopathic killer, the caterpillar
Don't tell me when I'm supposed to rap until
Especially when your favorite rapper ain't even half as ill
A savage still, the track's a banana peel, attack of the silverback gorilla
You're havin' a little trouble fathomin' this is actually happenin'
Like Anderson Silva back when he snapped his shin in half
And then had the shit hangin' by a flap of skin
After he tried to plant the shit back on the mat again
Pad to pen I’m batty like eyelids when they're blinkin' a lot
You copy me, but you're not
You can't be butterflies, my offsprings are just moths
I see that thing I'ma squash it and rip the wings of it off
So ring the alarm, pull the extinguishers off of the wall
Set the sprinklers off like Jada Pinkett and Queen Latifah
'Till the shingles come off the roof we'll shout at the ceiling
Slaughterhouse in the building, middle fingers aloft
Say what I think when I rhyme, in ink-pen I talk
And the language I speak is my mind
Kingpin and Penguin combined
Spit like it's King of the Dot
A singular thought I think of will help you distinguish apart
The frauds from the cream of the crop
(Wait a minute) Hold up like a flashcard
Damn dawg, is that copyin' or payin' homage?
It's sad because dad taught you to rap as a damn toddler
My dad is your grandfather, I'll have to re-hatch on you
Come back as a black wasp, half yellow jacket, you can't swat a
Sasquatch dancing on top of an ant trample it and stomp it
Smash it and stand on it, dammit, I can't stop it
The rap is a vag' and I'm goin' in like a tampon in this bitch
It's a manslaughter
Stampin' out grasshoppers, you can't be no Rap Gods
In fact you're exact opposites, you make a wack song
And can't hold a candle but even Daniel-san whacks off
You jack-offs need to come to grips like a hand job
The boom bap is coming back with an axe to mumble rap
Lumberjack with a hacksaw
Number one, but my pencils are number twos
'Cause that's all I dos with 'em, poop is my pseudonym
On the john like a prostitute when I'm droppin' a deuce
And when I'm producing them lyrical bowel movements
These beats are like my saloons
'Cause these bars always got my stools in 'em
And I don't need Metamucil to loosen 'em
Bitch, shit is real like I pooped Jerusalem
I'm 'bout to go spin another cocoon
Then I'm cuttin' you from your mother's womb
Then I'm flushin' you!",https://genius.com/Royce-da-59-caterpillar-lyrics
Boblo Boat,Book of Ryan,2018.0,"[Intro: 
Sample
 + 
Cedric The Entertainer
]
""Cruising down the river; dancing till your feet got numb; cool summer breezes blowing through your hair as you stood gazing down the river in anticipation of the thrill of the dizzying rides at the amusement park—ah, memories of Boblo Island.""
All is your world ain’t nothing but a squirrel tryna get a nut
. Just jealous of everybody that’s headed out on that Boblo boat. 
It is the perfect weather and the perfect time to enjoy a few snacks. Aw, man, I wish I was joining you—a little cheese and crackers, 
a little Cana wine, a little Riunite on ice, some Harvey’s Bristol Cream
—but let’s do this, only on Smooth FM.
 

Nothing compared to our family trips
My uncle shook hands with a manly grip
All this hand-me-down-shit; I had had an uncanny fit
All the gangstas I had in my family had me anti-bitch
My granddaddy mistress caught the business from my granny fist
That was back ‘fore I was born
Pop told stories ’bout it that would last for hours-long
And as a family, we was just so happy
When him and mama got along on the Boblo boat
Uh, on our way to that black amusement park
Wood rollercoasters, crack sold on plastic scooter cars
Uh, smoking grass at the vintage food court
Broken glass, waiting on you on the swimming pool floor
I came across my identity on the Boblo boat
That’s where I lost my virginity, no condom, though
That’s when paranoia hit me like when superstition does
Left my inhibitions I guess where my supervision was
Parties on the way to the island would be the livest, though
First time big bro hit the bottle was on the Boblo boat
But neither one of us knew that we would both
Grow up and turn to alcoholics, though, Boblo boat

Hey, hey, hey, lil’ Craig, come here. Aye, hit this, nigga. Nigga, don’t worry ’bout what the fuck it is, just drink!

Yeah yeah, yeah
Some of my better times, I shared with you
I shared with you, yeah
Shit, all of my better days, I shared with you
I shared with you, shit
And now I gotta wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Shit, stuck inside a rat race (fuck)
Rat race (fuck, fuck)
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up again
Stuck inside this rat race (fuck)

Yeah, look
Twist the cap, lift the bottle back, swig it
Dig it, ten-inch rims on my mama’s Civic
Ten-inch woofers in the trunk, to be specific
They bump, rattle the license plate, plus the windows tinted
Don’t even give a fuck that it’s dented, bitch, I’m the man now
I’m rolling, driving it slow as if it’s stolen
Piling up bros like we was clothing on a dresser
Calling up hoes like we was Jodeci, let’s check her
Double D’s like double-deckers, I wanna sex her
But these keys don’t come with game on how to finesse her
Five semesters left until college, I’m under pressure
I’m not a real nigga ’til I undress her, I gotta ‘press her
This was my main concern back when concerns were lesser
Nowadays, I often yearn to press the
Backspace button or hit return but life is not no word processor
Most folks would burn the sess to burn the stress of
My real-life trauma plus fickle niggas thinking they done heard the best of
Jermaine Lamarr but that’s insane, it couldn’t be further left of
The truth is that my new shit slap, you never heard it better
Give me a sec, I murder sectors, prefer to let ya
See it rather than say it, but it spill out, I gotta chill out
Say “Fuck the world” and never pull out
We had no Boblo boat but I could note
Those times is like a Bible quote
BC, before cell phones, the first time I would smoke
I was six years old,
 
but that’s for another chapter
That’s for another story, to God be the glory
I made it out unscathed and now I sunbathe
With my son in Tanzanian sunrays thinking ’bout dumb days
Thinking ’bout dumb days

This is; 808-Ray
Nigga don't worry about what the fuck it is, just drink",https://genius.com/Royce-da-59-boblo-boat-lyrics
Writer’s Block,Success Is Certain,2011.0,"Yeah! I don’t know what else to say
I can’t, I can’t think of nothin'
I’m stumped, here we go!
On your feet! Stand up! Everybody hands up!
Uh, man, I don't know man
Every time I go to think of something played out to say
You already said it

I ain't callin' names 'cause all of y'all the same
Plus I'm the king, all my past pain all done changed up
All these plains, all these lames, since the Slaughter's came up
'Cause they know their hands tied, feet ball and chained up
Niggas be quick to call me the new 50 Cent
Because of my relationship with Marshall
Used to make me a little partial, 
but here's the brain fuck
We the same, 'cause
I'm probably 'bout to fall out with a young buck
While I attempt to fuck the fuckin' game up
Bitch, splat! Only thing I fear in here is chit-chat
You are hearin' bars like your ear against a Kit Kat
Shady guys like the Navy, try us, wavey bye-bye
Maybe my Glock can turn your top to Baby's Maybach
My shit is parvo, literally sick
Trust me, nigga, it's ugly to kill; the thing is, the bigger I get
The more disgustin' and fuckin' disfigured it gets
Niggas expect me to go pop, oh, stop
Y'all about the Champagne, I'm about the toast, I
Only fuck with mailmen with heroin from Boca
Niggas that'll smoke you while you starin' in your postbox
Only incense he enlightens when he's thinkin'
While that sinks in, I got a Brinks ink pen
I'm back! Motherfucker, notice the flyness on the cover
Of the XXL, 
I'm back from the dead
Like Tobey Maguire from the Brothers
How y'all realer? If I said it, I did it
If I didn't, I seen it first-hand like a card dealer
Give up the throne: your lease up; 
I am the Mona Lisa
That decoded Da Vinci Code,
 you throwin' your piece up
Is a waste of fake like a phony B-cup
Makin' the mistake was like my only teacher
Wait 'til they get a load of me, 'cause—

I've got Guccis on my feet,
 
diamonds on my neck
Diamonds on my wrist, bitches on my dick
But y'all already said that
Choppers in the trunk,
 models in the front
Bottles in the club, but I don't give a fuck
But y'all already said that

'Cause sometimes I feel like it's so hard for me
To come up with shit to say, ayy
I'm at a loss for words, 'cause y'all already said it all
I think I'm runnin' outta clichés
I'm gettin' writers block, psyche!

When I stand up in this booth, niggas notice it
Sittin' on the same boat that Noah built
Floatin' on the same water Moses split
Poetry in motion, but we sittin' on your grave site: overkill
Aren't you tired? Why are you so loud? Quiet
Real dudes move in silence, like a mute drivin' a new hybrid
You dudes is too excited
You a dude that'd try to sue a dude that's suicidal
You will just be another victim
I'm like a nickel of weed rolled in a doobie: I'm a little twisted
I roll like the end credits in movies, y'all just got scripted
Got y'all niggas' bitches bobbin' to this one when she wit' ya
When she with me, she bobbin', not vibin'
Tryna put her mind into the inside of my zipper
I'm a serpent with a purpose
Havin' problems? Not a problem
I've encountered, I have found elephants, lions, clowns
Will jump through hoops like they workin' for the circus
If the fire 'round the circle's right in front of them, fire rounds
Pun intended,
 gun extended, what are you marks askin'?
Car's Aston, started as a hard-top and I saw past it
Since I decided to start class, this all black, all glass
Panoramic roof been gettin' marked absent
I authorize my own all-access
Your bitch a whore, I'm a catch, she ball-catchin'
Her jaw's been broadcasted
All across the globe from the store to Japan
Her pussy need to be blocked and reported as spam
Interscope, I been this dope
Now sell it, my voicemail is full
Got bitches screamin' inside of envelopes
And they tryna mail ‘em to me
Tryna reach my phone, I don't know which one is harder:
Tryin' not to take your bitch or tryna get rid of my own

I've got Guccis on my feet,
 
diamonds on my neck
Diamonds on my wrist, bitches on my dick
But y'all already said that
Choppers in the trunk,
 models in the front
Bottles in the club, but 
I don't give a fuck
But y'all already said that

'Cause sometimes I feel like it's so hard for me
To come up with shit to say, ayy
I'm at a loss for words, 'cause y'all already said it all
I think I'm runnin' outta clichés
I'm gettin' writers block, psyche!

Man, get the bozac!
We need to start bringin' that shit back (Mad flava!)
Man, fuck it, I'm 'bout to catch some wreck
(We in effect, money!)
Mad props to Royce for keepin' it real
On the strength, 
no diggity
I'm 'bout to go pull some hoes, get my mack on
Haters get the gas face!",https://genius.com/Royce-da-59-writers-block-lyrics
Boom,The Rock City Mixtape,1999.0,"I'm the verbal-spit Smith Wesson, I unload with sick spit
The quick wit could split a split-second
Bomb with a lit wick expression
You hear a tick tick then you testin'
My saliva and spit could split thread into fiber and bits
So trust me, I'm as live as it gets
Everybody claim they the best and they head the throne
Since B.I.G is gone, if you ask me, they ""Dead Wrong""
My flow is hotter than the flash from the click
When the hammer slaps the bullet on the ass from the clip
You wind up in a room full of my dogs
I'll have you feeling like a fire hydrant in a room full of dogs
So come, come now
, 
get pissed on, shitted on
Tough talk turns to, ""Can't we all just get along""
You get blazed when the mic's off, shot when it's on
You probably ducked when they laid the gun shot in your song
My gun st-stutters when it speaks to you
Utter shit to repeat to you
Enough in the clip, to give a speech to you
Me and Premier, we kind of the same in ways
We both speak with our hands in dangerous ways
Rap now is a circus of clowns
A whole lot of lip from cliques I'd probably rap circles around
I'm the next best to reach a peak formerly known
As the best kept secret, I guess that I just leaked it

""Tragic like the havoc of a nuclear bomb""
""Boom, boom, bam, God-damn""
""Royce 5'9""""
""Tragic like the havoc of a nuclear bomb""
""Boom, boom, bam, God-damn""
""Royce 5'9""""

I'm a motherfuckin' star, I don't battle no mo'
I provide the gun clapping round of applause after your show
And we could go toe-to-toe 'cause they calling you hot
Stepping around all your punches like, ""That's all you got?""
Everyday I'm meeting somebody and all of they peeps
Quick to shake a nigga's hand and show me all of they teeth
And these bitches, I be patting they asses
They be all dumb and googly-eyed looking at me, batting they lashes
Rappers think Detroit niggas not as down as them
Or since that I'm down with Slim that I sound like him
Quick to judge me and tell me that my hook might sell
And say faggot shit to me like I look like L
My advice: quit talking, it's over, I was knockin' niggas out
When you was knocking sticks off of their shoulders
I got dirt done in my past, I know y'all sweat
I got regrets older than some of you so called vets
Niggas say I found God with the flow
Bring the police to the studio
And bring the bomb squad to the show
Ain't a nigga touching mines
; when you listen to my shit
You don't chew, you don't breathe, you don't miss a fucking line
Every time I spit, I tick to show you it's hot
Leave me in the deck too long, I blow up your box: boom

""Tragic like the havoc of a nuclear bomb""
""Boom, boom, bam, God-damn""
""Royce 5'9""""
""Tragic like the havoc of a nuclear bomb""

Do you give back to the hood you from?
Or run, go to the jeweler?
When you got beef, do you stand or run?
Or talk from your computer?
Do you boss up? Put your people on?

You think you the people's champ 'cause people playin' your single
But I don't think that you should keep playin' with me though
'Cause every time I squeeze a damn 3-4, that's the Reaper playin' bingo

Black women wanna be built like cartoon characters, Eric Cartman
That bears a strikin' resemblance to Sara Baartman

Now Google that when you get a chance
You gon' find out America's heartless

'Cause niggas out now grindin', tryna earn what I got, uh
Stick to the script, my advantage was hustle
So I'm sayin' off the muscle, I'm here, and careers I could cancel a couple

Papa came home from another day of hard
Work and handed me his key, told me ""Go look in the car""
So I went out there to look for what he asked me to get
I was checkin' all the seats but the only thing I saw
Was a bag of cocaine (Say what?)
Uh, Papa was too solid, he ain't never tell a lie
I went in to tell him 'bout it, he said ""Oh, that must be Guy""
He worked with me at the job"", I said ""Oh"" and walked away
He said ""Oh, before you go, make sure you don't tell your ma'
'Bout the cocaine"" (Say what?)
Uh, me and little homie, we was walkin' to the store
It was right there on the corner and we seen a guy that's homeless
He was wrapped up in a blanket, he was lookin' really cold
Then he asked us for some change and he asked us if we know
Who had the cocaine (Say what?)
Cocaine

I'm losin' my mind, trying to figure out
How did I inherit so much pain
I drink a lot of alcohol, problems with the law
Would I have done better or the same
If Daddy never tried cocaine? Uh
If Daddy never tried cocaine
Cocaine, uh (Say what?)

So my father's only next logical step was to go to rehab
Can't let go
And that's exactly what he did
Of my high hopes
He went to rehab and got completely clean
Hasn't done a drug
My high hopes
In over 20 years
He did that for himself but
My high hopes
He did that because he didn't want to lose us
Whew, strong man

Uh, now let's talk about how much I respect my pop
He's been through so much in life, we ain't never had a lot
We just had each other's back, that was really all we need
Pop', I love you unconditional and thanks for loving me
More than cocaine

I'm an artist, drug dealer, foreign car keys
Drop jewels so these falcons like the Maltese
Birds in the trunk so these keys, now they homin'
Letters and numbers on the Coupe like it's Roman
Woo, all black like the omen
Kim said it, yup, BIG wrote it
So I'm feeling like a Greek God when I quote it
Lightyears ahead, but I was caught up in the moment
Moment of clarity, moment of silence
Burner on my waist, yet I'm saying stop the violence
Sitting on that white horse, look at prince valiant
Dad shakes his head cause the worst waste his talents
I philosophize for them Pitchfork scholars
Devil on my shoulder and the pitchfork follows
Poking at my problems, I know how to solve 'em
With a ski mask, automatic or revolver

A slave is one whose power and authority is ruled over by another and whose sphere of freedom is limited according to the wishes of a master. Your power and authority is ruled over by another and your sphere of freedom of activity is governed by the wishes of somebody else

Them niggas wanna see me runnin', they know I won't
They say misery loves company, no, I don't
Ain't got no time for you to try on no Manolo Blahniks
All I got time to do is go back in time
And pose with the Unabomber
Just so I can go back in time a second time to photobomb it
I live by a code of demonic, Illuminati, Obama, Hovanomics
Hold up, hurdles in life, I hop in a Turbo and roll around 'em
I'm Doug E. Fresh in the flesh, I beat box
I boo-boo-du-du between the sheets to seek the G-Spot
I'm in bed with three naked ladies holding hands
I'm in bed with three major labels
And I ain't talkin' 'bout wearing clothing brands
Underground locomotive man
Putting on a global show that no promoter can
I philosophize with wise words from learned lessons
In my world mistakes turns to blessings
The hate turned to destiny
I'm saying ""Lord Jesus"" while the Lord's most gorgeous creatures take turns blessing me
I got your baby momma down on all fours
When drama comin', I'm all for it
If it ain't about the money please let this be your last question
You players can jump if you want
But you half-stepping like Paul George
I make the yay invisible in like a day or two
That's how the players do, my nigga, there's layers to it

First in science, first in technology, wealthiest country on Earth, most powerful country on Earth is twenty sixth in education.
 So you have all been taken and you don't even realize that you have been dumbed to the point where you are like sheep

Paranoid of poverty, hustle was the philosophy
I seen a kilo, I swear it became a part of me
Lie, cheat and steal, I had it mastered by my teens
Started hands on, a nigga still pulling strings
Hotel suites, straight selling nigga's dreams
Motel 6 as I let the beeper ring
Was a water boy, but balling always in my genes
Season ticket holder, nigga sitting with the team
Feds on the roof of the spreads in the juice
So suspicious of the cars, tuitions for the schools
Labeled a mastermind, I positioned every move
Shots fired, now the deposition from the crew
Smooth operation, but the money came in knots
Forty million there, I dare you tell me what I'm not
I own fifty homes and wanna get fifty more
Counting this fast money and fucking my bitches slow

Tabernacle,Tabernacle: Trust the Shooter,2016.0,"Yeah
I wanna share some shit with y'all
All truth, all truth

Uh, like I'm standing inside a Tabernacle
I promised not to lie in not one of these verses
I started out as a battle rapper
All I knew was Maxells, ADATs, DATs and gats
Uh, my name is Ryan Daniel Montgomery
Recovering alcoholic, I grew up on 9 Mile
Uh, I'm not a gangster, drug dealer or thug nigga
Just an MC who made a name with his rhyme style
Now, sometime around '95 I found my calling
And that all coincides with the time that I found my darling
Now later on in the story, I tell you her significance
But now let's talk about me, specifically, three brothers and one sister see
My daddy taught me consistency with his fucking patterns
Hallelujah I'm the son of a addict
My addiction was music, all I would do is go to the studio and The Shelter
And listen to Redman and Heltah Skeltah

Aye y'all remember that one joint from the Heltah Skeltah album called?
Sean Price be like, ""I'm not sure any—"" yeah, that was my shit
I used to bump that shit all, day!
By this time I knew I wanted to be an artist
I didn't want to be anything else
You know, but my mom had plans for me
She wanted me to go to school, so you know

Uh, to make mom's happy, I took some general courses in college
Took the bus until I got hella bored with that
Because the bus stop I had to walk to
Was right across from the first studio I ever recorded at
Now I would have to assume that it was either meant for me to be rapping
Or meant for me to be laughing at God's geographical humor
As soon as I stepped foot in the open-mic, it was like a reunion
I was a shoe-in
I met Kino there too and he asked me to manage me
And that was back in like, let me see
'97, my girl was pregnant, hurdles was prevalent
And it was therapeutic just for me to breathe into my mic
Started learning why the Lord put certain people in my life
And the way he started blessing me, uh
I guess before my inner demons got the best of me like sneezing was my vice
Needless to say that December 29th was the day I became a believer in fate

Okay now it's December 28th, my day has gone great
Kino booked me a show under contract to do that night
I got a call from my girl's people saying she's in labor
In the hospital right now, 9th floor
I get on the elevator, elevator stops on the 5th floor
Elevator opens up, my uncle's standing there crying
Now I'm caught off guard, I'm like, ""What the fuck?""

My uncle standing there like, ""Ryan, they that way""
I walk out, I see my momma and that entire side of my family
Looking like there's some kind of drama happenin'
I said ""What happened?"" They like ""Granny's been in a bad accident
And it ain't looking good"", I'm like ""Man, what?""
I'm having a baby four floors up before I froze up
I'm trying to figure out why the Lord chose us
Or maybe chose me, to ride in this emotional rollercoaster
My momma said ""The baby here yet?"" I said ""Maybe""
She said, ""Maybe? Baby, go see""
I walk away feeling like a good father, the same time as a terrible son
Get to my girl she 5 centimeters dilated so I waited
She got to get to 'bout nine 'til it's that time
And meanwhile I'm more popular in this hospital than the doctors
Nurses watching, whispering like ""That's the one right there
Who got a lady in labor on 9 and another lady dying on 5""

By this time I don't even fuckin' remember that I got a show
Somebody had to remind me, the doors was already open at the venue
I got emotions runnin' every which way
All the nurses and stuff is like, ""We'll keep you posted about the baby
We'll keep you posted about your granny.""
I didn't like seeing my mama like that, so I had to get out of there

Yeah, I hit the stage at 11:50, killed it
I got off at about midnight with about six types
Of different emotions floatin' around inside me
Hopeless, tryna find me, hopin' in time God'll guide me
In the future, just as I was about to leave out
I saw Kino talkin' to Marshall and then he introduced us
We talked about collaboratin' and how chasin' this rap thing is aggravatin'
But I'll get back, I got the family waitin'
I get to skatin'
As soon as I get to the hospital, they tell me that my granny didn't make it
She just died, I'm feelin' helpless, it hurt me
On the flip side, my little boy is healthy in the nursery
I picked him up, looked in his eyes for the first time and just cried
Ain't no denyin' this is the power of God
I said, ""I love you, Granny"" and looked to the sky
Like even though he just got here, goodbye

This is how the story goes
Powerful day (now you know) powerful day (now you know)
Most significant day in my life
I mean aside from meetin' my man Marshall
My son bein' born and my granny dying on the same day
My grandma didn't live anywhere near that hospital
I learned a lot this day
I learned that the universe has this way of balancing itself out
For me to lose such a beautiful soul in my granny
And gain such a beautiful soul with my first born son, little Royce
It showed me that God is real, God is real
And you know what they say: God giveth, God taketh away",https://genius.com/Royce-da-59-tabernacle-lyrics
Black Savage,The Allegory,2019.0,"I don't know what this world is coming to

Yeah, I ain't ya average rapper residing in Calabasas
Mashin' the Aston through Malagasy in Madagascar
I don't believe in your white Jesus and Last Suppers
I place value on brothers who never had justice
I am the black savage
Ali and Foreman in Zaire fightin' for black magic
Rifles and flak jackets, mama was suicidal, papa had bad habits
Product of true survival, rocker like Black Sabbath
Hoppin' up out the Chevy, Pac, Biggie, Machiavelli
OG like Nas or Reggie, culture like Ox in ""Belly""
Vulgar like Akinyele, focus like Dr. Sebi
We did it your way, but now the culture is boppin' to our Sinatra medley
I'm limitless energy, they gimmicks and imagery
Kendrick, Cole, and the Kennedys, lyrical Holy Trinity
General of the city, they into promoting silly beef
Keepin' it Willy D, Weezy on the ""A Milli"" beat
Dream Chaser facin' the enemy like my nigga Meek
Tyler Perry writing my winning speech like it's Emmy week
Heart of gold, never sold my soul, Glock weighs a ton
Hov tellin' Lori Harvey, ""No"" at Roc Nation brunch

One life to live, just don't settle (Buck, buck)
One life, I'ma live forever
Stand for something, fall for nothing, no
Rest in peace the dead, that's on my soul
You only die once and then you gone
Who thought we'd be fighting all alone?
Who don't know the rights from the wrong?
Truth comes to the light behind it all

How much more do you want?
You wanna send us back to where we came from
'Cause we just savages
Well here’s my ass to kiss, yeah, yeah
I'm made of gold, my nigga
I go back home, I'm a goldmine, nigga
We taking all the land back they stole, my nigga
'Cause what you reap now is what you sow, my nigga
Where your soul, my nigga? Goddamn

One life to live, just don't settle (Buck, buck)
One life, I'ma live forever
Stand for something, fall for nothing, no
Rest in peace the dead, that's on my soul
You only die once and then you gone
Who thought we'd be fighting all alone?
Who don't know the rights from the wrong?
Truth comes to the light behind it all

If I ruled the world
I would go return all of the gold that was stole
Reupholster the nose on the Sphinx, it's a world war
Huh, they tryna take the soul out of soul
Niggas say I sold out, I never sold out a show
Even though people drove out in droves
Plus a whole lotta hoes, I suppose
""On the road to success, you gotta pay the toll,"" I was told
I don't hang with pawns, I'm Genghis Khan
Slang with a gang of cons that came with guns
Who speak the language from the ancient ones
Dangerous, huh? We shinin', nigga, shame the sun
Do I move D or stay in Saint Laurent?
'Cause y'all fashion week and this ain't Milan
Calusa to your Juan Ponce De Léon
Make sure it's peppercorn sauce on my filet mignon, my nigga

One life to live, just don't settle (Buck, buck)
One life, I'ma live forever
Stand for something, fall for nothing, no
Rest in peace the dead, that's on my soul
You only die once and then you gone
Who thought we'd be fighting all alone?
Who don't know the rights from the wrong?
Truth comes to the light behind it all

My first reaction, raise my hands up along with my antenna
Sinner 'cause we born sinners, killers 'cause we want dinner
Try to warn niggas, better keep on growin'
Try to stay away from foreign, nigga
Better recognize when the Devil show his horns
He enjoying his whores like Donald Goines
There's a difference 'tween yours and Tomeka and Lauren
Young Warren Buffet in his prime, you ain't even know it
How she supposed to get thick? You just be feedin' her corn
With your corny ass get robbed while she fuckin' on your horny ass
Go to jail, tell it all before you ask for your attorney ass
Nigga, look, you could never be me
Knew who I was 'fore I got out the trap to sell a CD
I been shoulder-shoulder with gangstas facin' LAPD
Felony after felony, still they be yelling me free
Now my philosophy is, ""No possession, no apostrophe""
'Cause ain't no use in being in prison, you ain't gotta be
Ironically, we dodging crazy crackers with hammers
Just how they used to dodge nigga with braids and bandanas
Man, it been more mass killin' than it's days in the year
Wonder if fighting for it worth as much as leaving it here
I'm sayin'

One life to live, just don't settle (Buck, buck)
One life, I'ma live forever
Stand for something, fall for nothing, no
Rest in peace the dead, that's on my soul
You only die once and then you gone

I'm no longer a prospect
I'm what you call a veteran, a legend man, I'm a prophet (Huh)
You ain't no artist, you're what I would call a concept
Made to inspire gossip like Shade Room or like Bossip
Welcome to the Grammy's where your likeness is used
For promos, hypeness and views, okay, I hope that you knowin'
That if you voted, you might as well've not voted for no one
They knew when they made that category where that trophy was goin’
All this industry shit is (Dumb) there ain’t no middle class
Raise yo glass, here's to classism
Either you a rich ass nigga or you’s a bum, there ain’t no in between
Sinners sell they souls, angels sell they halos and they wings
I had dreams of fuckin’ a R&B chick
Then I found out that R&B chick already had a dick
Already slept with your favorite rapper, aren't we sick?
You start as a artist and turn to alcoholicking quick
This shit is (Dumb)
Man I wish I would let a nerd who work at Interscope
In a coat by Kenneth Cole, consult me about my image, bro

Silly, you could drown without a membership
Watch who you swimmin' wit (Dumb), it's ten of us ridin' up on the city bus
Sittin' here tryin' hit for the scripture like it's Leviticus
Tacklin' reality, prayin' that it don't injure us, uh

Niggas quick to talk, all hood 'til I pop up
Plus, you just act tough cause Suge got locked up
I am above y'all, when you droppin your raps to diss me
I only recognize the top of your hats
And I don't like Proof punk-ass, he think he tough
He keep thirty niggas with him, cause he weak as fuck!
I ever catch you by yourself, I'mma fuck you up
Snatch your little cheap-ass chain and piece you up
You better hope you and the white boy keep in touch
And be a good little hype man, or your lease is up
Since Slim signed 50, I don't see your teeth as much
That's good, cause you got a grill like a fuckin truck!
DAMN HOMIE, it's history, over, hang it up
Go somewhere and hang up some 50 posters, PUNK
You speak too late, y'all prolly gon' go up to them awards
And get yo' ass whooped by B2K
I just wish Eminem would stop tellin' everybody he ain't speakin' to me
Like I'm one of his hoes or somethin'
How 'bout this, I ain't speakin to you, chump
And I'mma keep pickin on your weak ass crew
(You bitch!) Bizarre you a fat stutterin fuck
You a joke, I choke whoever buttered you up
I've been ridin by your house, you don't come out too much
You hidin, when I find you I'mma snatch you out of that truck
And tie your fat stankin ass to your couch and just
FEED YOU, you already look like you about to bust
Nigga you can run or hide; I'll be on your porch
With a cheeseburger tryin to lure you outside!
Cause he's in it, Bizarre say G-g-g-g-g-g-unit
I bet you throw some extra ""g's"" in it
Just like a stutterin' fool can't reach intelligence
He sweats when he raps, cuz he got a speach impediment
(You bitch!) Porky's pig and Porky's tomb
About to dig his own grave with a fork and spoon
(You bitch!) Denaun and Swifty please
Give it a year, both y'all be rakin' 50's leaves
What do I know, that other nigga y'all got in your group
I don't even know his name, but he can shovel my snow
(You bitch!) Let's face it I gave it to y'all
My lil' sister got six puppies that's braver than y'all (barking sounds)
Niggas is startin' the beef I'm 'bout to end with the quickness
I'm 'bout to end this quicker than Bizarre can finish a biscuit
Quicker than quick shit, y'all ain't felt the half
Quicker than Eminem can pinch Elton's ass
Don't call me, I ain't ready to squash it yet
Kiss my ass! I don't wanna talk to Hex!
I am so sick I should be compared to cancer

Y'all lil' niggas crack ya heads then rhyme, go play;
You lil punk ass niggas, y'all can scream and yell all you want
I feel like I'm battlin' Keenan & Kel

Matter o' fact, I might even do a song with Ray
Sign with Murder Inc. and hit you with a song a day

FUCK you and your commercial appeal
I turn yo' head into blue 'n yellow +Purple Hills+
I bet you whatever that nobody beats my family
Eminem, Nelly said that he'll eat you like candy
What did you do, got on the phone and called him up
You don't wanna talk to Royce, but you talk to us
(You bitch!) Yo' crew some local hoes
I hit you harder than that white girl that broke your nose
You and Royce can squash this with one talk
Step around from your security and talk to that man
I understand you backin' yo' crew, but this my brother
Anythin' that happen to him, somethin' gonna happen to you
And I don't give a fuck for that, nigga, I'll do life
I advise you to stop; yo' money don't buy you stripes
Only thing that money brings is fake niggas and problems
Followed by niggas who hate fake niggas and rob 'em
But you niggas is WACK; Denaun I'mma stab you
So many times, I'mma feel bad when you collapse!
You niggas is so BITCH you make me sick to my stomach
Every beat that you ever made sound like it was missin' somethin'

Fuck y'all hoes, I told Royce I ain't like that motherfucka
Faggots, I smack the shit outta any one o' y'all niggas
Sell my bill one nigga
What the fuck y'all thought nigga y'all'll get bought bitch
Street orientated; y'all motherfuckers hate it
Learn how to flow stop bein' mad y'all bitches
Trick Trick, when I catch yo' bitch ass, yea dude

Legendary (Success Is Certain),Success Is Certain,2011.0,"I'm legendary, legen-legendary, I'm le-le-legendary

The theme song to my supplier, plays in the key of a ki,
 
I'm like a messiah
Crossed with The Wire,
 rapping around the Boardwalk Empire
Who brought their Bibles? This the Christ chapter
I'm sick enough to take my life then take your life after
Don't take me light or play me light: we two of the same
God melted the Rubik's cube into fluid and threw it into my intuitive brain
I'm eating food for moving music in the gratuitous lane
Been through twice, now I'm running through until I'm through with the game!
You can find me under a black cloud: I'm a dark star
Only thing I hate worse than a mark, is a marked car
I climb mountains like Marvin Gaye, Tammy Terrell
You could put a face on my style; it'd be Sammy Cassell's
I switch the fire up like I am a tranny from Hell
What I got in my hand right now should remind you of Stanley Burrell
Cause it's the hammer, the cannon, you can dance with the shells
My pet peeves are granny panties and planning to fail
I'm a heavyweight; I'm catastrophic
When I set it like Farenheit 9/11, meditate 'til the levees break
I tar and feather featherweights until my 'fetti straight
The MAC-11'll clap your melon and give your ass spaghetti face
You ever looked inside some dying eyes?
You'll see surprise and realize there's no denying God
When was the last time that you heard that the ""I"" in ""try""?
Ryan vibes like cyanide; I am proud
To say that I've evolved, there's only one ""I"" in defying odds
Small-time arrogance perishes every time to giant pride
Who y'all respect is probably cross-dressing
Your favorite MC can probably find himself, vibing to my 
Lost Sessions
I'm legendary

Now everybody wanna believe me
But they don't really know what's in my heart
This time around it's startin' to feel easy
My enemies starting to fall down
(I'm legendary, legen-legendary, le-le-legendary)
My enemies starting to fall down
(I'm legendary, leg-legendary)
Fall down (le-le-legendary, legendary, legendary)
I'm legendary

I got my noodles intact
You want support of Detroit rap, niggas can Google this gat
'Cause we the reason why you eating, we put the food on the map
Right where the mitten is and you ain't do jack
Just who we kidding here? This here's a different year
So you shouldn't assume that I'm tryna measure up to you
When I tell you the ruler is back, in fact
As far as you new kids, what have you did?
I know that I've burnt some bridges in the past, but I'm happy to say that I built a new bridge
As far as killing I'm forever willing and ready
I will make my children's peanut butter and jelly sandwich with a machete
You marry the streets then we will kill at your wedding
Tell every guest at your reception they gon' get more than just hit with confetti
Now your bitch a believer
You know what you get when you mix a bumblebee with a lamb?
You get the 'Ghini I'm sitting in
Riding through Pittsburgh 
while I'm listening to Wiz Khalifa
Black and Yellow,
 the blunted joint: here's the reefer
One minute you tough, one minute you shook
I know, I learned a while ago, to hide power from you, I should just put it in a book
You illiterate parasites: I kill you every time
Throw a nigga' body around the room, have a nigga looking like Jamiroquai
And yes I, am a firm believer that the naked truth
Looks a hundred times better than the best-dressed lie
And why you niggas is hating?
I wonder is God really an atheist? He made me the same temperature as his nemesis Satan
Y'all need to repent cause y'all been imitating
A statue of me, to you is a statute of limitations
You backwards as me and a feminist dating
Let's tally the sales like Gladys and Patti LaBelle: I'm a big wig
My straw's in the hole of a volcano: I'm having a big swig

Now everybody wanna believe me
But they don't really know what's in my heart
This time around it's startin' to feel easy
My enemies starting to fall down
(I'm legendary, legen-legendary, le-le-legendary)
My enemies starting to fall down
(I'm legendary, leg-legendary)
Fall down (le-le-legendary, legendary, legendary)
I'm legendary",https://genius.com/Royce-da-59-legendary-success-is-certain-lyrics

You need to check up on your strong friend
Nobody ever checks up on the strong friend
Uh, strong friend

I remember 2003, out hear screaming, ""We next""
I was grippin' that 300, Rock & Rye Lexus GS
I put rhinestones in my durag, I put on leather pants
I went to parties just for Bacardi, I tricked, I never danced
All my friends expect to be treated just as my next of kin
Eyebrows lift up if I'm out with them and let them spend
The question is, ""How is y'all problems becoming my problems?
I'm already hiding all of my problems behind my pop' problems""
When I was nine, seen my father beat the shit out of my momma
I'm smilin' right now, I'm trying not to cry about her
Alcoholic, I just spent five thousand tryna buy bottles of Patron again
Now sing along with your strongest friend

Suicide, it's a suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide

You need to check up on your strong friend
The one with strength that's never gon' end
The one with sense, take care of several grown men
Pay they rent and then they trade on him, the Devil play to win
I remember I had Maia Campbell in my Mercedes Benz
You probably thought she gave in to the plot of Satan's sin
She got demons greater than, you and I
And this message is to Denaun and to Shady, you say we friends?
Well take care of Lyric, 80 and baby Quinn like they Hailie then
Well shit, it's my funeral, y'all should play all of my songs too
Hope my body look beautiful, while I lay in my strong suit
Rumors spread about me that ain't true, that's how the fake do
If I'm the strong friend, then what the fuck do that make you?!

Check up on your strong friend, uh

Mr. Grace (Intro),The Allegory,2020.0,"[Intro: Derrick Grace II & 
Daughter
]
What is America built off of? 
Violence and entrepreneurship
So if you had to tell another six year old like yourself what to look out for, what would you tell 'em? 
They would kill you for the right price
Are you a buyer or a seller? 
A seller
If I gave you a million dollars right now, would you buy candy or a candy store? 
A candy store
What is the goal to be? 
Independent
If you lost everything tonight, what you got tomorrow? 
Intellectual property
And what is intellectual property? 
They can take your possessions, but they can't take your mind
How do you say group economics in Spanish? 
Economía de grupo
How do you say barter system? 
Sistema de cambio
If I gave you something for 500, and you flip it to the next man for 2000, what is that called? 
Upselling
Alright now, me, as your leader, as your father, the person that's supposed to have your best interest
If I celebrate holidays and Christmas your entire life and you gotta go beg somebody for a job at 18, what did I do?
You failed me financially
And I want you to tell me, how fast can somebody be a victim of gun violence in America?
This fast
 (*Gunshot*)

Was told to hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil
In a place that hears no evil, sees no evil
Where the oppressor sees no color
The investor sees no others
The erection seems so seasonal, plus illegal
Man, that's just the mode, that's just the evil
We just adjust to that, that's just machismo
I was destined to be mo' than a apple laying next to a tree, bro
Clandestine, colorful G stuck in a G code thrust into street mode
Searchin' for soul with a stolen identity
Surface low, economically
In need of capital, in search of a loan and 
it's a few bankin' institutions who got the remedy
But this is America, where 
credit is for the privileged and profit is not my amenity
I'm just here to get popped by the cops, get popular so I can get discredited in a documentary by the enemy
While in a homicidal, fratricidal cycle of wild, constant hostile energy
Lookin' down the barrel of a rifle while tryna find some inner peace
As God as my witness, through teary-eyed tyranny
Knowledge itself is the caveat and the dollar itself is the demigod
Listen, nigga, this is 
The Iliad
Flip the dollars for wealth until our figures resemble the myriad
We are the inventors, we are the lenders, we are the matriarchs
Only thing we didn't make was slavery laws
And on this specific day, it's the end of the prison sentence, this is the period
A rich man wrote this with a poor man's focus
A sick man quotes this, but the dope man sold this
Lookin' for a soulmate and the bitch playin' Go Fish
Provin' you got heart doin' dirt for The Tin Man in a quicksand culture
Standin' on anything I said like the kickstand open
Feelin' like Rembrandt sculpted some shit that just van Gogh get
I am the descendant of the original, physical melanin skin man
The highly-intelligent pride of the ghetto, the Zinjanthropus
The Phantom's so clean you can't see the lord sit, damn, she is gorgeous
All you see is a steerin' wheel floatin', led by a herd of stampedin' horses
Checks and balances by the curb
Steps to amateurs flyin' birds
Connected annual to a buyin' surge
Expectin' the amateurs to try and merge
To try and lessen the blesses, but you can never lessen the connection of the indefinite 
pentameter
 Ryan serves tryin' words
This is Category A
Definition, battered slave of yesterday
Recognition by cattle
Present picture, a guy battles sexuality in tight apparel, eyeshadow
That's not deep, I'm shallow
As time travels, rapper-boys get to doin' acid on stage
Wearin' satchels, catchin' cases like statutory rape
Online actin' like natural-born slaves, really
I guess it's from the back of the back 
to back to sittin' with my back to the shadows
With actors standin' behind me with puppets controlling nothing but shapes
But that shapes our fate
This is the 
Allegory of the cave

The first forty-eight, ""Death Of the Dope Man""",https://genius.com/Royce-da-59-mr-grace-intro-lyrics
I Got the Keys (Freestyle),The Bar Exam 4,2017.0,"Yeah, I'm starting to have fun now, so you know
I got the keys, keys, keys
I got the keys, keys, keys
Y'all are the kings, kings, kings
I roll up to squeeze
Y'all are the kings, kings, kings
Well, I'm about to see, I'm about to see

I talk scrilla like a art dealer
I'm large money that's been augmented for the small printer
Homocide business got me side flipping like I'm cartwheeling
I'm Godzilla wearing Margiela in the mall inside of the Guitar Center
Got the boss mental
Got me off a little barking at the dog kennel
Keys open doors, I said keys open doors, squeeze open fours
Leave your boys leaking, leave your overlord lookin' like some old weave on the floor
Please don't ignore me, I'm going to war
Blowing weed in a foreign toy
My shooters killing anything I'm pointing towards
Anything I'm pointing towards
I would swing this mic when I'm rhyming, thought I better bring it
I’m what you’d get if Fetty Wap were to rob a marksman
With Robert Markman, a dead eye Genius
A Jedi demon, 
he sip promethazine, I bet I lean him
I made a million, I ain't sell out, I just got the hell out Neiman's
Nigga, my chips up, ask me ""am I in my P-R-I"", I stop you just so I could spell out Pringles
I'm in the strip club, I shell out singles
I'm the flowing boss sweeping semis, pick one
Head or tails, either way, you are about to let Akeem in
I came in here to grow the crime rate
Bodies on top of bodies on me
I got skeletons in my closet that could do the ""Famous"" video with Kanye
My status loony, nigga, I love my chrome
IMac and Uzi more than Donald Glover love that song ""Bad and Boujee""
""Bad and Boujee,"" I'm a black addict mooly
With an attitude in a padded room full of savage ghoulies
Eratic goonies
I don't battle, I look at battle dudes like ""Battle? Who, me?""
Fuck you niggas, I'm steady waiting, I fed him bake
You know that devil's food, them Betty Cakes
And I got something for them crooked cops too, let him pray
Turn his wedding day Freddie Gray
Let that machete behead him, set him straight
Let it devastate, let his soul levitate, let the levies break
I'm murderous, 
I got Reaganomics in my verbiage
I'm a wavy rhymer, a Mercedes rider
I'm a 89'er Cartier with diamonds
At the furrier, Saint Laurent sipping Merlot
You would never catch me boxing with the burner
Hundred in your mouth like Ted DiBiase did to Virgil
Rolling over these hurdles playing C Murder then I'm playing G Herbo
Gang of cash on me, keep the thumper with me since I became a sinner
Black youngster, I don't know if I'mma tip the waitress tonight
Or make it rain for dinner
I don't know if I'mma sign a deal or stay independent, it's not just a simple thing
Aston Martin topless while I'm weighing my options on the triple beams
Learning that life ain't about the expensive shit, it's about the simple things
Like a sexy side bitch with zipper lip, clit nipple rings
You can not stop what is already going
African bitch got her face on my lap
The blacker she is, the badder she is
I was called tarbaby growing and I'm feeling up to par
Whenever I see the police
I address them as top of the morning 'cause I feel above the law
Riding, do I look like I am supplying the drugs? Fuck raw
I am the plug, fuck raw
You niggas is about as much action as a buttoned-up bra
I'm taking everybody instrumental, going Ted Bundy on it
Out here cooking so much the original sound like it's Peg Bundy on it
I'm Christmas gifting, y'all wrapping shit
I fit the description of accidents in the axel of the bent
I have an immaculate acumen
You a splitting image of accidental flatulence
All it takes to be a gang banger on wax these days
Is the engineer that come in and patch you in
Yes, sir, I'm too charming to stress ya
I'm cool, calm, and collective
I'm electric, you Carmen Electra
If I catch ya you gone on the stretcher
Now question
How much protection does a vest and armor get ya?
Especially when you armed with weapons stepping in the wrong direction of armageddon
Uh, keys, keys, y'all got the keys, keys
Ride up and squeeze, squeeze

"Royce da 5'9"" Freestyles on Flex | Freestyle #090",Funk Flex Freestyles,2018.0,"I'm ridin' with the K solo, I'm spellbound
Used to ride with Delilah and Nicole in the Fairmount
I'm who incite the riot, you the guy at the staredown
I worked at Taco Bell, now I just fire the shell rounds
Now somewhere in the air lies the truth like a thunderstorm
I terrorize the youth as if I'm gunnin' for 'em
I could've jogged here, I marathon the booth and let it run its course
The R's here I'm paralyzin' you like the underscore
Your riders couldn't impress my chauffeurs
Your favorite artist couldn't benchpress my notebook
I transcend like Wu-Tang to all eras, cash rules
Now I'm just dead nice, the pallbearer of bad news
Shouts to all my niggas out there in the locks of crime
Remember they can lock your body but can't lock your mind
You lack triumph when you stop the grind
You rappers Blac Chyna, went and got your bread and went and got behind
Gun professor, I'll punch whoever
Come here lookin' like Conor McGregor
Leave this bitch lookin' like Uncle Fester
Question, are we bitter rivals?
'Cause we can shoot the Ks or the fade
'Til both of our arms get vitiligo
I stay in my prime, y'all niggas just sippin' on scotch
I stayed with my nine, y'all niggas just live with your pops
I sit in the original lyrical pivotal spot
Even though I changed with the time like digital clocks
Either goin' straight for the kill
Gun-slingin' or I'm goin' straight up Jada and Will, I come swingin'
I write for B.I.G. and 2Pac
I'm rollin' like the prices on the coupe dropped
I'm dolo like a sniper's on the rooftop
I'm sicker though, I'm feelin' like the flu shot
I shit on every artist on the charts and leave a diaper on the jukebox
My mind's like the Japan bullet train, it floats in cycles
Rhyme full of pain, spoken right out the smokin' rifle
They wanna see me tweetin', ""Yo man, who need a feature?""
I'd rather squeeze until the Colt jam like Lisa Lisa
I'm 5'9"" givin' niggas them 6'9"" fears
We can battle like them Grind Time kids
How about this, how about I take your wifey on tour with me
And never give her back, same way my nigga Big Sean did
I go hard 'til 2088, my father was crazy like Hailie Jade
Still I was born a Saint like Baby Ye
I prayed hard and only God I fear
You just plain playin' God, lookin' like James Harden without his beard
These niggas hoes, man it's sickening
They only goals is get some golds and bitches and
Get on the 'Gram wearin' a Roc Nation hat
But anybody who's anybody knows
The closest they ever came to seeing HOV was....
But anybody who's anybody knows
The closest they ever came to seeing HOV was bein' witnesses
So run along with your little microwave hits
All you niggas is my light work like the day shift

Yeah, right now I'm finally respected
Until the day that I'm finally neglected
And I'm fallin', I'm callin' all kinds of pyrotechnical fires in the sky over Heaven
During my final eclectic spiral I die, right on the steps
As if I don't accept it
If it ain't green, I don't see it, I'm color-blind
With my eye on the exit, with my other eye on the double line
On the essence and any other kind of successes of the grind
Dominoes with destiny I'll forever be fuckin' fly
I'm fired with flows, top five and you know
I'm happy at platinum but I was happier
Back when 500 thousand was sold
My proudest accomplishment now
Was when I got quiet to get sober
And silence is gold
I let my whole story fly at no cost to the people
While I'm talkin' to Joe, no Budden
I'm talkin' Joe Walsh from the Eagles
No stuntin', we just wrote somethin'
My demise was s'posed to be weeks ago, keep your smoke comin'
I'm over here with 500 styles like a savant
You wanna see me washed, 500 pounds like I'm Avant
Hair dyed and all fried up like Yung Joc or Jaheim
Only way I'm goin' out is gunshots or sirens
We make paper, you party, we play Vegas
Nothin' but sirens surroundin' me when we play wagers
I'm fuckin' the bitch of my dreams and we they favorite
My BMWi green like DeRay Davis
I be givin' bitches orders like they mothafuckin' grandpa
Trappin' is for rappers, I be grindin' like the dancehall
I don't know astrology, I just know I'm a Cancer male
Eatin' south of France, he who doubts the man can't prevail
Back when Guru used to manifest the rhyme
I was known for nothin' less than just a candidate for crime
In and out of Ibiza, spendin' power, a Visa
Standin' the test of time like the Leaning Tower of Pisa
In my D-zone so the bitches gon' sweat it
Got the same piece of chrome Sweets loaned Bishop on credit
Got the Glock Craig used to help out Smokey and Day-Day with
The 38 Mad Dog used to pop JJ with

Everybody comin' with their hit record, big record
This gon' play in the clubs, radio, chick record
Either that or they come with a diss record
I come from where you don't disrespect none of your successors
I don't fuck hoes that I can't leave in less than six seconds
""Who the best?"" is a horrible rhetorical sick question
You guessed it, I'm throwin' bullets at you, but you ain't about to go for long
I'll pull the .44 and let it bang like Post Malone
Might as well get ready for your tomb, you play me
Tell your wife she gon' be solo soon like Swae Lee
Quarter pills, recoupin' the deal worth a quarter mil'
All I'm tryna do is stay Black and get out like Jordan Peele
Everybody do it for the accolades, I'm tired of them
I ain't cared about Grammys since Jay boycotted them
Spent my first advance at Manny's followin' Pharrell and them
Used to ask bitches for ass, now I'm just tellin' them
If I get anymore fly, I'ma need my own space suit
Got these hoes gettin' naked like they high off K2
All I need is five minutes, every style get augmented
Well-endowed, in God's image, 
never smiled, Kawhi Leonard
These pellets of pedophiles comin' out this arm, bro
They touchy, trust me, Dudley, Arnold
My show start at 12 and it sold out by 11
Rappers blow up, then they debut their whole album on Ellen

Ain't nobody fresher than him, that dealt with more pressure than him
Never dealt with niggas whose image is skinny stretchy denim
Just remember everyone who with me winners
Everyone who with you dinner
Bitches switchin' quick as Bruce and Krissy Jenner
Chrome rims on the whip, just to shine on niggas
Black tires, the lip white, Tyrone Biggums
We givin' out turkeys on Thanksgiving like Nino with us
We even passin' out TVs like Wendy Williams
All I know is that I'm the wild child
Y'all don't want no smoke with these bars
All y'all niggas know is y'all SoundCloud
Let's hypothetically say I'm pissed
I would definitely AR grip, I would definitely spray off quick
Y'all expectin' me to hesitate to shoot this bitch
Then y'all are definitely in the playoffs with JR Smith
I'll definitely put my hand in your pockets but not the way you want
I'll put your whole family in boxes like y'all the Brady Bunch
I go bananas, too miraculous to react to mortal mammals
Cookin' crack in my new velour pajamas
Gettin' back to my roots rap where I store them hammers
Lore the grammar, my IQs my actual quarter-panel
My IP address is my dresser drawer
I ain't stressin' unless it's war, I ain't said shit, less is more
I bet you you'll die less of my iron's legend for regrettin' gore
Ghost whiter than the driven snow and it's headed north
Lookin' like it's four of the seven dwarfs, flows and metaphors
Bury skulls all over the globe like a Stegosaurus
Why these niggas gettin' their hair dyed and their nails polished?
I'm like Biggie and Pac trapped inside of Big L's body
I don't relate to common folk, they focus on the comments
So I'ma go roll a Testarossa down the coast of Monaco
Lo and behold your honorable, niggas is sheep
Niggas asleep, 'bout as woke as a dinosaur
My connect'll give you a whole kilo of coke
So he can go Geronimo
He should receive a trophy for bein' the Holy
Jesus of flows, he the GOAT
Baaaaaah, that should be my tag
I'm from the streets where the odds are not even
Robbery themin', ball, it's debauchery schemin'
Allah and Jesus, it's hard to believe
I'm a product of Eve in the Garden of Eden
Thinkin' how targeted we've been
Rihanna's stalker, I'm parked in her DMs
Shark in the deep end
Put these paws on you, I'll soften your defense
Hit your pause button, halt your critiquin'
Talk is cheap, the more I hear you talkin', it cheapens
And all I see is prey 'round the streets today
I'm 'bout a freak away from havin' Issa Rae eatin' out Lisa Raye
Any artist out that you see is great
Tell him I said bring his ass, better bring his A
Let his single play
We don't care what you sing
Hit you in your face with the butt of the gun
You leak and give your street credit a few streams
Pop go to weasel nigga fever nigga I'm the illest
You got pop culture fever, nigga
All I know is B.I.G. and Pac quotes
Pop toaster, squeeze the triggers, season tickets
Now I pull the cops over, give them niggas season tickets
Wifey used to shoot me down vicious, now she the missus
She turned me to a family guy quicker than Peter Griffin
I told myself when I was 14 that she the one
Now a nigga prolly got more seeds than Peter Gunz
Now a nigga grow up, my groceries in two-seaters
Used to roll the old-school, four speakers and two tweeters
Ridin' with nothin' but raw, quarter packs in duffles
Ryan writes heaters
Y'all niggas is cut like one of them 
Get Rich or Die Trying
 wife beaters
Me, I'm just all shoulder straps and muscle
If you're a hater, let's do it
I'll whip you now then I'll whip on your boy later
Them whippings'll go around like a tornado
I get rid of more yayo
I don't do Rodeo or ayos, I do the Floyd May-o
So many men shoppin' in women's section it ain't no ladies left
You niggas crazy, yes
You playin' crazy like the Chappelle sketch, Wayne Brady ep
I'm what you get when Freeway Rick and Cocaine '80s met
I'm bringin' bars back to the street like Jay and Nas beef

Power,Book of Ryan,2018.0,"You want what for Christmas? Hell no
What you mean, ""Is this is all we got""?
That's it

It's Christmas time in the Montgomery home
Daddy's actin' all crazy again
Mama got herself a bloody nose
Daddy slapped her in the face again

Why they always gotta fight so much? Damn
Mama face swole, me and my bros in a panic state
If that's the case yo, I can't just stay around this
Everything was fine, we just had dinner, we got all the He-Mans
Battle Cat, Adam and Cringer, even Castle Greyskull and Snake Mountain
Now we sit and listen to y'all argue about how y'all planned this day
And y'all just admitted to us Santa fake so Kid Vishis just ran away poutin'
Now I gotta go and console him
He wasn't nothin' but a spoiled little boy then
Little naive with an innocent cry, all he ever wanted to do was fit in with us
And y'all bought him a pair of fake Timberlands and put 'em in a real Timberland box
I never forget them boots, they was called ""Rugged Outbacks""
Mama went and found them at Payless and made us promise not to say nothin'
Then Pop came in like he ain't know nothin' about it
Like, ""Judy you gon' send that boy out in public like that?""
""He'll be just fine, these kids ain't 'bout to be
Lookin' down at his feet for no tree,"" and she really meant that
Meanwhile, this little arrogant nigga caught himself stuntin' on me and Greg with 'em talkin' about, 'Where y'all Timbs at?""
But he was too young to detect sarcasm so we was like, ""Nigga, where yo' Timbs at?"" Pf-haha

It's Thanksgiving in the Montgomery home
Greg just came in here drunk again
Now mama tryna cover for him
She afraid my daddy gon' punch him again

Why you gotta get drunk so much? Damn
I wish you would just stay where you was at
Instead of comin' home all rude and disrespectin' all our father rules and shit, man
The mood done switched me and Vishis playin' Connect Four
Our favorite movie just came on the tube and it's ironic it's ""Bloodsport""
And I'm lookin' at Frank Dux and shit, thinkin' you should split
Before Daddy come down these stairs of this basement and see you wasted
But he just cut me off like, ""That nigga ain't gon' do shit""
But the truth is this, he couldn't whoop my dad even if he was sober
I know 'cause he tried once
Ended up unconscious, a broke arm and a tooth was chipped
My big bro got a lot of emotional problems, he feel that we was all abused as kids
He saw mama get dragged down all kinds of stairs like a ragdoll when he was two
And this is back when Daddy used to sniff cocaine, poor thang
He had to be subjected to this when he gets drunk, he gets to losin' it
He gets the illusion that he gon' protect us all from the Big Bad Wolf
Stand up to him and prove some shit
But all he really doing is stressin' mom out
Got her goin', ""Boy, you know your daddy up there asleep
The food is ready, why don't you stop
Making all this noise and just let him stay 'sleep?""

The turkey's done in the Montgomery home
Dad has just been awakened again (Uh oh)
Greg is making all kinds of noise
Dad is on his way angry again

""Who is that making all that God damn noise?"" (Not me)
""Greggy (Huh?), get up here! You been out there drinking again?
What the fuck I tell you about coming in my house with this disrespectful shit?
Nigga, where the fuck you done been?""
I'm thinking to myself ""Greg, please don't say nothin' stupid, man""
Every time my daddy in his drawers and he's standing in the hallway
Mad at somebody, I swear to God he got the same strength as Superman (*Sniff*)
My brother turned around and just walks in the kitchen
Without even givin' an answer with his back to him like, ""I ain't gotta talk to you, nigga""
""Nigga, you don't hear me talkin' to you?""
Next thing my brother did is something that when it comes to my father is something you just don't do
He looked him right in his eyes and he asked him
""What the fuck is you gon' do?"" (Mm, mm, mm)
My father hit him so hard his body hit the stove
The oven door hit the fucking floor
The turkey fell out the oven hole and landed near the stairs
Now Daddy standin' over Greg talkin' 'bout ""Nigga, you ain't hurt! Get up, get up!""
And here come Vish' talkin' 'bout, ""Dad, I don't think he gon' get up""
Then mama went damn near hysterical (
Ahh!
)
She called the police, the police came
Neighbors is all in the street
Watching the cops takin' my father out in handcuffs
Damn, man that shit was real embarrassin'
To all my friends I grew up wit', who grew up fatherless
I know through me you live vicariously
I want you to know that we ain't no better than you and yours
We all needed therapy
We care about each other more
Than we care about if anybody understands us
What I'm tryin' say is: Fuck you and Happy Holidays from the Montgomery family

Every man reaches that point in life
Where he don't want to make excuses no more, more
Life took me on a roller-coaster ride
I've been up, I've been down, all the ribbons and my daddy game
Took me on highs
Turned around and then took me on lows (This is how the story goes)
Ohh, then I think about it
I use that shit as fuel
Then I changed it into

(Power), now can't you feel it? (Can't you feel it? Can't you feel it?)
Can't you feel it? (Can't you feel it?)
That I'm a grown man with (Power), yeah (Yeah)
Let me hear you say ""yeah"" (Yeah)
If you was raised in a strict home like me, felt alone like me
And it gave you (Power), ooh
You can do it too, just look at me
See I'm a grown man with (Power), yeah (Yeah, yeah!), everybody say ""yeah""
If you don't know the meaning of abusive
You've been through so much ain't nothin' nobody can do to you
Now can't you feel it? (Can't you feel it?) I'm a runaway
This is how I became, a grown man with (Power)
Ooohh, you can do it too, if I can do it
Use this (Power), I was a runaway, I was a runaway
There ain't nothin' none of you can do to me, do to me

When you were a child growing up with Grandad and Granny
Did you really feel like Grandad was a good father to you?
Absolutely, absolutely
All my friend's daddies was walking out on them left and right
You know he never left us, he was always there for us
You know there were a lot of things that happened that I didn't understand
Maybe I might not have answered the question the same way when I was a teenager
But I understand and appreciate him so much more now as a man
You know 'cause he taught me respect and discipline
And consequences for your acts, so yeah, of course
Do you think his approach as a father
Really shaped the type of father that you are today
Or do you in some ways think it had negatives to it?
And if so, what kind of negative traits
Do you try to avoid having as a father right now, to me?

Uh, this is just how I zone when Porter spaz
I was born at a quarter past
I was the color purple, Mom and Pop took me home in a Crown Royale bag
Now I'm the hottest nigga that you know with the coldest intentions
Uh, all I know is this flow and this pencil
The Lord is my shepherd, the Devil's my Doberman Pinscher
The industry said I had to be an alcoholic
Who be havin' threesomes, be doin' acid and havin' seizures
Wish I could go back to my old school and slap the teachers
All I had to do to blow up was an album packed with features?
I don't relate to common folk, they focus on the comments so
I'ma go roll a Testarossa down the coast of Monaco
Lo and behold, your honorable
Niggas is sheep, niggas is sleep, 'bout as woke as a dinosaur
My connect'll give you a whole kilo of coke so he can go Geronimo
He should receive a trophy for bein' the holy Jesus of flows
He the G.O.A.T., baaah
That should be my, taaaag
I'm from the streets where the odds are not even
Robbery, thievin', ballers, debauchery, schemin'
Allah and Jesus, it's hard to believe I'm a product of Eve
In the garden of Eden, speakin', how targeted we been?
Rihanna stalker, I'm parked in her DMs
Shark in the deep end, put the paws on you, I soften your defense
Hit your pause button, halt your critiquin'
Talk is cheap, the more you niggas talk it, it cheapens
And all I see is prey 'round the streets today
I'm about a freak away from havin' Issa Rae eatin' out LisaRaye
Any artist out that you see is great, tell 'em I said bring his ass
Better bring his A, let his single play
We don't care what you sing, hit you in the face with the butt of the gun
You leak and get your street cred and a few streams
Pop go the weasel, nigga
Fiva Nina, I'm the illest, you got pop culture fever, nigga
All I know is Big and Pac quotes, pop toast and squeezin' triggers, speedin' tickets
Now I'm pullin' cops over, give them niggas season tickets
Teesha used to shoot me down vicious, now she the missus
She turned me to a family guy quicker than Peter Griffin
I told myself when I was 14 that she the one
Now a nigga probably got more seeds than Peter Gunz
Now I go out to get my groceries in two-seaters
Used to roll the old school, four speakers and two tweeters
Ridin' with nothing but raw quarterpacks and duffels
Ryan writes heaters
Y'all niggas is cut like one of them ""Get Rich or Die Tryin'"" wife-beaters
Me? I'm just all shoulder straps and muscle
If you a hater, let's do it, I whip you now then whip on your boy later
Them whippins'll go around like a tornado
I get rid of more yayo
I don't do Rodeo or ales, I do the Floyd May-o's
So many men shopping the women's section, it ain't no ladies left
These niggas crazy? Yes
They playin' crazy like the Chappelle sketch, Wayne Brady ep
I'm what you get when Freeway Rick and Cocaine 80's met
Bringin' bars back to the streets like Jay and Nas beef

This that ""your career's over"" flow, for real
This ain't four-wheelin', roll with coke, heroin, 'caine
Bone chilling, cold with no feelings
Bangin dope-dealin-Hov and No-Ceilings Wayne
Started out like Nas, shoot gun
Heavy is the head with the crown
Slaughterhouse, my mind's two tons
Hardest out like John Q's son
And everything you say greasy
And made up like a piece of cheesesteak
And everything I say come natural
In this thing of beauty, like Alicia Keys face
How can I be hated in the streets
When I'm on even on my off day
I'm creative when it's beef, while you throw salt
I'm your baby mama and them new salt bae
I'll assault they, a la carte tray
Molotov through your restaurant window
Mr. Hyde, Dr. Jekyll, Nickel Nine, Ricky Grimes
I'm Sylvester Mindbender
I spark fours, that'll arch floors
That'll have whoever acting hardcore
Doing parkour, I'ma dog Porter
Brought the dog for, recording harsh thoughts for the art form
Taking me to your elite is like
Showing Chuck Norris where a glass door is
While I'm just tryna stay outta jail
Last war I stay strapped for it
Y'all can run while the gats blowing
And if I miss your ass, then I guess
You saved by the bell, like Zack Morris
I'm on bando time when I ride through cities
Before my time R.I.P. Bobby Krissy
Or Bobby, Whitney, flow K-Ci, JoJo
Let the Tech N9ne go KC, MO., bro
I don't stand my ground, I just demolish niggas
Simple you against me you ain't ridin' with me
Bitch not only do I kiss and tell
I'm Orlando Brown when I describe them titties
I'm the rubberband man, but I do more than count bands
Fuck sipping 40 ounces, I'm sober out here
Fucking hoes like 40-ounce Van
Nigga I'm Pusha T doing quiet numbers
Getting silent money, I'll retire from it
I don't dress loud, I throw the flyness on it
Let the labels talk and Desiigner mumble like Donald Trump
Throwing money hitting everybody and they auntie up
Trying to find someone to come perform for me 'fore I fuck the whole entire country up
I'm the first one gunnin', last one runnin'
Too enlightened for a check
Any rapper that want it, I'm Wack 100
Invite 'em to a scrap
I narrow down shit the Farrakhan way
You can find me anywhere the crime wave
I'm Schwarzenegger, you Sarah Conner
And your favorite rapper act like Eric Andre
Ryan's still alive, played nice 'cause the drama still flies
Even when you shoot your little Uzi vertical in broad day
Like you still tryna kill God
I'm French kissing with a ""bitch you"" mentality
Voodoo and como talle vous
While I'm hula hoopin' dollars for that snarly tooth
My future look like juju in a body suit
When you niggas gon' admit it?
That I'm better than the youngins
That I'm better than the legends
Never did I dumb it down or did I settle
I'm Rick the Ruler in every different measure
I ain't just the R, I'm every different letter
I can give your chick eleven inches if she let me get the leverage
I can be president if hip-hop would just let me switch endeavors
And I'm just having an open workout in Heaven
Tryna get me a good sweat
I'm Jae Millz looking up at the sky like, ""Ayo B.I.G, am I good yet?""


When you a fiend for the rhythm and the beats just keep callin' ya
They keep callin' ya
They keep callin' ya

When it's hard to understand me 'cause my jaws keeps lockin'
My parents keep callin', the Lord keeps watchin'
I'm standing on the corner with my boys, beat boxin'
And anywhere I go, all of these whores be jockin'

The dogs keep barkin' at the top dog
They already lost it, nigga, it's a lost cause
I remember when I had to pawn all my jewelry
Was so embarrassed by the help that no one offered to me
Zoning off the bottle, we only taught to fight back
We only talk survival, walking home, we just might scrap
All we did was write raps, tryna get so drunk
Had to get my sight back, product of the old gun
Made some bad decisions so early on in the process
I had people out to get me, my album wasn't even out yet
I'm talking 'bout the self-proclaimed ""King of Detroit""
I seen some people reaching they dreams, some people destroyed
I seen people die at the hands of the violence of man
Seen people shot out the sky, being fly as they can
Seen 'em split the pie up and Pam sniff her entire two grams
Slipping, now we in your crib to tie up your fam
'Cause it's hard to really focus when you're tryna stack for ya
Lawyers, with those in power tryna blackball ya
It's hard to find employers like accountants that's loyal
With those who told ya they adore tryna back-door ya
You ain't on-point though, one minute, you popping trunks
Next minute, you happy man, next minute, you sloppy drunk
Every January 1st, the ball keeps droppin'
And I'm just celebrating it at the mall, we shoppin'
Celebrating friendships, ""bro"" this, ""cuz"" that
""Fam"" this, ""borrow"" that, ""loyal"" this, ""trust"" that
Comas after comas that were alcohol induced
If I ain't wake up from 'em, I won't ask what y'all would do

When it's hard to understand me 'cause my jaws keeps lockin'
My parents keep callin', the Lord keeps watchin'
I'm standing on the corner with my boys, beat boxin'
And anywhere I go, all of these whores be jockin'

I had to bite down, bite down
A nigga had to bite down, bite down
All I could do was bite down, bite down, down
Bite down, bite down, I had to

Hundred yard dash through the hood, talking money runs
Using that money counter, getting rid of them funny ones
You know the ones, too wrinkled to go in them slot machines
Throw 'em on the titty bar floor to lower a thot esteem
You could be the hottest thing and still have the wrong team
Sometimes to see the bigger picture, you need a wider screen
I got the arm out the black beatle, beating the drum
Mannequin challenging whole families, viva la drunk
It's Nickel Season, the fever's begun
I'm savage, even though my tat issa knife, I'm keeping a gun
Loaded cartridges, stolen cars with the Lowenharts
Rip the game apart and you are not worthy like Wayne & Garth
By now, my life's so righteous, I don't even sleep with groupies
I move like that nigga Spike Lee when he was Mookie
Back in high school, I really clowned
I said I'd do the right thing if Rosie let me ice cube them titties now
But this is realer than movie depictions
What you niggas know 'bout making a move in a beef and truly committin'?
It ain't no squashing it after you push a certain button
Make sure everything under your lip cut and your shirt is tucked in
Burning your beard away with Magic Shave
COs frisking your pregnant bitch, turning your kids away, thataway
That'll in a shallow grave, casualty of a cabaret
Daughter calling some wack nigga ""daddy"" at movie matinees
Even when we deal with Saturdays, my children still know that
I don't want another man's cheap-ass ways on my doormat
And anything I do from legal to illegal
I do this shit the ski mask way, like I'm Lil Kodak",https://genius.com/Royce-da-59-beats-keep-callin-freestyle-lyrics

Closest I'ma probably get, to window shoppin'

I've been a real nigga since the beginning
I did it without the ridiculous gimmicks or pretentious pretending
I was taught the sky is the limit by way of Fenkell and Plymouth
But my only limit is sticking my dick in a chick with a blemish
I speak from a frequency that was meant to uplift the antennas
I sing with the intention to riff with 
The Tenors
, my gift is tremendous
I didn't get rich and forget the incentive
I'm never buying into religion or soliciting sinners, my nigga
We attribute the original wave we articulate
Through bricks of yay, zipped up on 18-wheelers on interstates
We distribute weight then matriculate into real estate
Then we assimilate, powder dealing they probably still 'a hate
Me and Em came through, did the original Renegade
Gave that shit to Jay
, 
then spit a gem off stage at Dilla-Day
Used to rock the byzantine 
mix Cîroc with the grenadine
Euthanize the blocks with a sinner they tend to intervene
Snitchin' is a sin, as mixing your linen and denim jeans
Growing up, blowing up was a long shot, like drone shots or limousines
In between Greyhounds and Jim McLean
Dome shot a cop with a stray round like Slim and Queen
It's 'bout time we invest in our mental status
I write rhymes for Anunnaki slave ancestors on emerald tablets
Today we raging on Vegas stages with bass guitars
Yesterday was agents chasing us, aprons and mason jars
Planets align in orbit
My mind absorbs it, the finest orifice
Therefore my soul can glow in divine proportions
You niggas snitchin', you need to stop your beefin'
Cops crooked, wearing swastikas attending Nazi meetings
Liberace Nickel rock gems, Timbs and Huarache sneakers
The 'caine
 made me able to 
drop the deacon
 and go off the deep end
Y'all so weak, I forgot the weekend
Philosophical syllables seamstress speaking in a biblical Fibonacci sequence

I suppose I compose art like a 
Bartók

Especially now that I'm steppin' outta that economic apartheid
They left us out of the archive
I'm definitely probably a marked guy
My weapon's out and I'm wetting y'all like I'm 
webbing
 outta a shark's eye
Stepping out of a hard top on the 7 Mile and Oak Park, I
Where several bodies get hog-tied, and left inside of the chalk lines
10 toes standing on granite floors, 
a Mosano porch

That's for Meek
Drop a Lonzo Ball corpse off on Nas porch dog, that's for the blasphemy
No apathy, 
inside the mind of white supremist with cognitive dissonance most compromised position for blacks to be
They cast stones and sticks at the rap throne of drip and the coin flips and
Well, all you gon' get back is a splash from me

trapped in me
 
'fore there was ever a Yela' rapper beef
Throwing choppers in

Unloading them outta Hyundais
Loaded shopping in Mumbai
That's my modus-operandi
My portfolio expands
Income from the slick sayings
While the FBI tryna give the M1 to the stick-man
Spit them braggin' bars, grab your balls, that's the speech from all
They told us money talks, ain't tell us wealth don't speak at all
You a fan of ours or you not a fan of art
I'm a dog baller for Los Angeles broads my cannon bark, jam and spark
And it talk, brrrrrrt, skip, brrrrrt, hold up, skip
Man this bitch sounding like Shannon Sharpe
Don't get your soul thrown to the deacon by way of this weekend's news
For violating a dude like me for publicity and views
Shorty don't get this .40 and this Colt .45 misconstrued
'Cause you new school dudes got Billy Dee confused
I rather watch Floyd May' flash in a Gucci store a day
Than work for a asshole who get mad at me askin' for a raise
Cop a new cotton-picking Aston in gray just for the slaves
You niggas current, Nickel was born and raised to destroy a wave
Rather give these young 'uns directions, 'stead of ignore they ways
Plant trees so all my advancees can enjoy the shade
60-40 ventures while tryna make 60 40 ways
Paid 40K just for the J's before the Ye's
Glass door attached to a castle, exquisite foyer
Side door trapped through the silver screen, Sidney Poitier
Flash gold on stage stone-face just for The Spades
Paid 50K for the stone flakes that's 40

Dead President Heads,Tabernacle: Trust the Shooter,2016.0,"Trust the fucking shooter

Uh
We in here counting dead president heads
Up in the years, it’s been up in the mills of dead president heads and counting
They put pictures of dead president heads on green, long papers
Then went and put dead president heads on mountains
How we ain’t gon’ make it?
You know what

I went from women asking “what’s the scent of your fragrance?” to center of attention
To dinners in Vegas, then all the way to Japan racking up yen
Now I’m all the way back
And I’m acting like Dennis in Vegas, stacking up wins
I’m a young black boy, armed, dangerous
To those who want to come and try harm or change him
While they’re living in anguish, while I’m living in real nigga harmony
Energy around me blend together like falsettos, tenors, and bass
All intelligence is on God level
All memories formed in melodies from the 70s
And all hail to all dinners and plates
And all hail to the cartels, and we out on a yacht
And you know how we know that we are and you not?
Because y’all are looking at our sales
I’m a motherfucking one-man army
I’m more R than our, I put the 'R' in ourselves
Uh, I’m the one they can’t generalize
Every time I come through straight, their wave minimize
Why? It’s probably ‘cause I gun through they gay enterprise
Niggas get crowned quick these days
Street this, best this, king that, we ain’t seen that
All we see around your clique is squad cars
Niggas need to get crown vicked these days
Stop kicking it, you couldn’t fit in my old socks
Let alone my shoes
I’m not a street nigga, I’m just a chip off the old block
I ain’t rocked with an entourage since ‘07
Niggas dissed Marshall after they copy his whole reference
Like we won’t send an actual firing squad to their studio
That will Basquiat their whole session
A lot of niggas dope, but none concern me though
I got that Pac, Big L, Pun eternity flow
I got that blowing that weed, taking that last drag in
And tossed in the infirmary glow
I’ll hit your broad in the gall bladder with this bald dagger
Have her hollering “not the knife” ‘til she having an orgasm
And all of her juices is haul-assing down the thighs
God dropped me off in the drop with the crossroads with crossed toes and dotted eyes
I’m not alive, I wasn’t born, I got a ride
Uh, get your popcorn, idolize ‘cause I’ve arrived
This is Cam Newton throwing bullets with the band shooting
This is beat submission from Bas Rutten
This the  edition of  it's proven
Nigga, pay your dues, you’re past due here
This cash rules, you’re looking at the wrong paper, this bad news
Relax junior, you still think you’re in high school
But you not, but you will be looking at your last new year
Ha, boo-ya, bombs over Baghdad
Compliments since 7 Mile, Fenkell Ave, Cash and Poo Bear
With directions to just go blasting through there
I ain’t stressing ‘bout none of you poindexter responses
I ain’t tongue wrestling with no artist unless it’s Ashanti
Nigga this, God, Gandhi, Kevlar labcoat
Mixed together with leather bathrobes like Plies and Fonzi
Cool science, I’m around lions and giants
You there, Ryan’s here
No one can hear you crying where I’m at, the highest tier
One diss track could tear your whole act up like the Flatbush Zombies
Gripping the Mac truck with Travis Scott, hitting your Macbook
I’m not a pioneer, I’m the last of a dying prayer
Living in forever, ever, ever, ever, ever in laughter
And ever since that heffer put me on MediaTakeOut
I ain’t fucked a basic bitch since
I got sophisticated bitches coming to my place asking “is it safe to sit?”
I said, “only if you have to take a shit”
Country chick named Delores, I let her sit on this Mason dick
Rappers blew up and get to shouting out designers
I like to thank my notebook, it got me out of the binders
Blacks never had each other’s backs
Rappers saying “All Lives Matter”? Okay, now we’re actually spineless
I’m into psychology nowadays, she say she bad
I’ll probably brainwash her like Hollywood did Stacey Dash
A lot of guys out slanging for a belt buckle like Pootie Tang
Wada-Tah!
5’9” the illest MC of all time right now and all the time
Kneel right in front of me like feel sobriety, young'n, or fall in line
Uh, right now, I’m piranha dipping in waters of Flint with the Slaughters and Em
Come on in, dummy, the water’s fine
Sniff around, I smell just like money, I ain’t hard to find
I’m doing big things
This bitch asked me do I got at least 50 shades
Just the other day
I said, “come here, let me kick game
I got more than 50 shades and just grey is the colorway”
I gave my momma a pic of myself in a big frame
And a card that says “bitch, I’m Rick James” for Mother’s Day
Uh, I just thank the Lord and pray for more
I just lifted the skirt of the devil
I don’t really care how you're dress her
Nigga, I'm just out here to take your drawers
Make the winner fall on the track
Let nature take it's course
I'm a product of the old Death Row camp
I ain't a fan of his, he might want to be standin' clear
I come with the cannon, not the cameras
I ain't Shannon Briggs, but let's go champ
Let's slow dance
Kill you with the first and give you seven more, necromance
Best flow versus yo petrol rants, you gassin'
This that new black Bent, blue Aston
This that who dat against who askin, who ya again
'99 the Outsidaz told me I wouldn't last
I'm too arrogant
But here I am, two boys two girls two era's in
And they over there on pills and heroin
Forks in they careers so that's real embarrassin'
If I could just get you clean through my charities
I might just let you breathe through me vicariously
But then again, I might not cuz I don't write sparingly
I'm torn between get along, fight, and why can't we
Fuck the Stitches approach
If I have to show up, I'm slashin' your throat
Your arms are too O.G. Maco to box with O.G. Wacko the G.O.A.T
I'm not a factor, I'm the whole problem
Down to subtract for a fraction of folks
Your favorite artist a diva
I put leaves around the heads of non-believers like drawings of Ceasar
Wake me when the sleepers are done ignoring me, bruh
I'll be flying with a full tank of gas on ether
If you from the block, watch y'all sons
Watch y'all daughters, 'cause I saw murder
Slaughter much as I saw hot sauce and hot dog water
I came a long way from wishin' under the stars
But I ain't come all of this way just to say I've come this far
Coppin' paintbrushes with black cards
There's no limit when it comes to this art
No need for twitter followers, I dodged prison
I'm the non-equivocal black and at large
Listenin' to a Timbaland track in a villa in Calabasas
I'm that same little Cringer and Battle Cat kid
Addict specialty pen and pad scenematics spazzin'
Fuckin' wit' a bitch about as bad as my spendin' habits
I got nowhere askin' can I have it
All the valuables I have in this world, I had to take it
Had to open King Tut's tomb up in my imagination
Had to separate fear from respect and admiration
Get rid of your fears
Time to remove doubts and
Think about it, there's two sculptors named Gutzon and Lincoln
Who carved dead president heads
Who got paid dead president heads by the president
To move a mountain
Uh, contemporary art deco
We keep the shit rockin' like the dails of Art Basel
Stompin' through this hip-hop shit like it's our step show
We survive
We should have bar mitzvahs for these bars
We the gods
We should shoot bar missiles with these bars
Beat the odds, look at the car see the rides

That's that yo ass is bleeding, that's that Kotex
I massacre your whole rap allegiance, oh yes
This one's for little bro who big bro ain't come back from the store yet
Hotep, I'm here for blessings sent my direction, no less
This one's for those who don't know they pops not invincible yet
Trick bitches hoes that don't know just how nasty they are
They out here wearin' the same tongue ring they ain't change from ten dicks ago yet
Hopefully that scope on that AR don't take my focus
To places where I put fakers in comas longer than daytime soapas
Any calendar day I'll hollow him like late October
I'll bury these niggas up under the Devil's playground, playtime's over
Your bitch fine, dawg, I can't deny it
She tryna be my wife on the side, I ain't invite it
I just, step over the ring and hit the bitch like Andre the Giant
Papa used to beat on me often for not being perfect
Thots used to call me tar baby, cops taught me that I'd be worthless
Mama gave birth to only one dark child like Rodney Jerkins

These niggas broke, on their pickpocket, watching us
They see the watch and this jewelry we rocking
Get sick to they stomach, now they tryna plot on us
They know this extendo we got on us
Can't name a time when it's not on us
Hope they try robbing us
So they can go back and tell niggas about all these bullets they got from us
I let that blocker unload, I put that pot on the stove, yeah
Now these CDs only product that's sold
Fans in Berlin going out of control, yeah
I fuck a lot of new hoes
Penthouse on top of the Lowes, Versace my robe
What's in my pocket? A knot I can't fold
Make sure my gelato is rolled
Uh, I am on a whole 'nother level than you, uh
My grandma used to say, ""Boy, you got the devil in you""
Fuck around, get some metal in you
My name ring bells, I could sell out whatever venue

For us, by us
For us, by us
For us, by us
For us, by us
(For you) By us
(For you) By us
(For you) By us

I'm tired of hearing 'bout what all these rappers'll do
First of all, none of y'all could last in the booth
I don't know what's faster, your wounds turning black or to blue
The media, to slap or to sue
Step to a nigga just to step on a nigga
Sounds easier to me than counting backwards from two
Bring the hood piece, you expect to buy the Benzes
Shell catch an iron, you ain't pressured by forensics
Half these niggas rhyming transgendered
You said it, gotta question how you meant it
I transcend, forever monumented
Not even Netflix could document it
My son got autism from injection by syringes
These nerds ain't warriors, we heard the same story and
You niggas blowing whistles at Hurricane Dorian
Blowing missiles back to the word of vainglorious
You sissy
Nigga, this is for us, by us
Why you put yours up? I'll put up my cup
Survivors of systems meant to divide us
You only can afford what you could buy five of
You a fool in a war with the faint of hearts
I'll let the tool encore, take your brain apart
I'm at the Louvre on the floor by the hanging art
I'm putting numbers on the board like a game of darts
Product of every single blood freckled Timberland
Buy up every building in the projects to contemporary art deco every tenement
My consigliere's Marc Ecko every sentiment
Cop a hundred rides, park 'em all in one garage
Money on my mind like Rocky thunder thighs
Everybody, everybody friends like they from Milan
'Til they in a hole in a lawn like the number nine
Long hours of perfecting this, 9-7 shit
Spitting seeds left the shells of pistachios on the keys of the Casios as the evidence
Bearing my soul, DiCaprio from The Revenant
Phantom looking haunted like a hayride
Camera on the trunk like the one from my prayers
Amethyst a gun, cummerbund child, they lied
Glamour chick in front, one of one I say I
And you know how I do
Put the beef behind me then put your soul behind you like De La
Twin white Maybachs
Steering wheel wood when I'm floating through the hood like sailors
Couldn't be cut like me if you had ten tailors
Put the wifey in a black Bent' Bentayga
Judge can't exonerate, violate
Got a mansion by the lake, got a maid, Consuela
I was fly even when I was a damn lie
I was flying standby 'cause of how I expand mics
Triple threat, bitch, I make the track and write
The judge can't give me life, bitch, I am life
You a algorithm
You niggas everything the culture isn't
I don't coach or visit
I don't get into the social digits
I just smoke distribute
Microorganism living my colloquialism",https://genius.com/Royce-da-59-fubu-lyrics

What's in my mind
What's in my mind
Riding on the wind
What's in my mind
Riding on the wind

I'm like royalty around y'all
Down to fall with niggas I feel are as loyal as me
Which is probably why loyalty is my downfall
Nobody's perfect, I'm first to admit
I know I'm flawed
Especially with the chicks I used to be with, that I don't call
I got an on-off switch that drives them up a wall
Wasn't my intention just my attention
Span for they kind, sometime it's high, sometime it's low
I switch into a magician when it's her time to go
Mekka-lekka-ha mekka-hani-ho, keep drama low
I ain't Clyde, she ain't Bonnie, no
She rode a rollercoaster ride with a junkie
Cheating on his wife
Stuck in the moment, now it his time to grow
I used to wear rhinestones, sometimes I vibe wrong
I'm just being honest
I'm the kind that can probably get addicted to anything
If I'm constantly around it
But I believe in Karma, so when bad things happen to me
In my career it was easy for me to stomach
Especially in a industry where they teach you to dumb it
Down for the public
I just keep it 100

What's in my mind
Riding on the wind
What's in my mind
Riding on the wind

Uh, which makes me royalty around gods
The more you grow into you, the more you mature
And you know your crew is gon' downsize
That's when it's beautiful
What I'm riding with 50 shooters for, I got to pray
Marshall made a nigga nigga-rich
That's rich enough to go muscle up and not rich enough to get out the way
Most dangerous position I could be in
Richer than niggas thinking, but not as rich as them niggas think
Shady got these industry niggas on some fiend shit
They use me to try to get to him, like a seamstress
I tell a nigga quick to e-mail Paul
And quit acting like a female dog
Other than that, shoutout my nigga Khaled
You the homie my nigga
If it was up to me, you know bro would be on it my nigga
You turned that Ross verse around for me in like a day
While I'm blowing Big Sean phone up for a verse
Feeling like, instead of this busy body shit with my family
I might as well try for Ye
Don't mind me, I'm just keeping it 100

You're choosing rappers you're friends with
Who be rapping what their friends did
Toolie ratchets and extensions
Wait, wait, wait a minute
We done already heard their best shit
We already got the message
They on a lean, molly, Percocet trip
Think I found what real success is
Running around here since ""The Message""
Forty pounder full of death wish
Money counter full of blessings
I sent a cannonball right out the cannon barrel
Through your wall, closet, through your damn apparel
Through your grandma chair, through your granite countertop
And I ain't tryna stop it 'til you standing on the doorstep
Of the man upstairs, nigga, you're next
Wait a minute, nigga
I've been going crazy on these records way before Flex
This the bad half Shady vortex, armed in navy warfare
Y'all them Barnum Bailey boys
Best to back the fuck up or get smacked the fuck up eighty million different ways
If I say it's fuck the world then the world's getting fucked
Eighty million different ways, when I'm finished with it
Then the world's gon get the AIDS like some

This the traumatize your favorite rapper year
This the homicide related racketeer

It's all downhill from here like Jack and Jill, wait

Wait a motherfucking minute
I'm giving all my hoes an ultimatum, she my mascot
I'm just tryna motivate her, I'm just popping
She's just getting ass shot like a Soulja Boy home invader
I get a whole clip to all my haters
Just so I could go and get ex-o-nerated
Wait, wait, wait a minute
Wait a motherfucking minute
I watch you niggas go tool up
I'm Compton menace on school bus
It's documented, boy, prove what?
Been dropping gems since I grew up
I got to fill this void move, bruh
The target's been destroyed, boo ya
These nerds rapping for attention
For a word from Vlad or Akademik
Prefer to slap you over engine
I'm Murs rapping for the Guinness
Wait, wait, wait a minute
I know you heard I'm back in business
I'm going harder than Tha Carter X
I'm birds flapping independent
I'm tycooning through the pressure
I'm typhooning through this weather
I might do a nigga beat for 'em
Give it back to him a little PHresher
Got the cash holding on line two, Brink's truck noise on one
Casanova with the rifle, fuckboy, don't run
I'm live from it with the streams
Buying guns and getting beams
You guys coming with your teams
It's feeling like iFunny with the memes
I flip the blade like ""say something""
Around dough like Rajon
Let you rip the stage then I come and rip the stage
Down more like Trey Songz
Category slaughter gang shit
Feel me, nigga, this is God hustle
Phantom or the 'Vette
Tomi Lahren, Charlamagne shit, the odd couple
Wait, wait, wait a minute
I’m primal if I’m fuckin' mating with her
I bend her over, stick her on the expensive car
Tyler fucking Creator with it
You a lame, you from Twitter fame
You had a chain, that's your nigga chain
Face down on your computer key sleep
Closest you gon' be to laying in your name
Body bag after body bag
Leave a trail laying in your lane
I'm Cold Chillin' on the record business
But I ain't saying I distribute Kane
Wait a motherfucking minute
You popping molly with the actors
I fucked the baddest of the white bitches

Dark secrets, closet probably look like Halloween
Y'all come out the closet just to market y'all new garbage
I'm inside your bitch apartment, dick is parked about nine inches in the carcass

Too narcissistic to be licking carpet
Too artistic to nut, this a catharsis
Fuck all that shit you talking
Y'all won't stand, y'all won't kneel, all y'all with is marching
Hard labor for your racist Caucasian bosses
Talkin' straight into a wire while it's taped across you
I'm still learning, wheels turning, tryin' to get the fortune
My side chick is still burning out, my dick is scorching
Talkin' 'bout, ""I think I'm pregnant, I'm not with abortion""
Any child that slides out you is an instant orphan

That's why it's nothing left to be, for these hoes, but a bitch

You been mixing up your passion with your goals for that fix
For that rose, for that risk, for that blow, for that sniff

Going massive for a cracker wearing a robe
And I just did a deal for my masters and my soul
For that whip, whole clan is in the Phantom
Damn, the roles have been switched
Look, I'm tryna just survive until my payday
Dodging these piranhas tryna rob me, thots around me hollering, ""Date rape""
This bitch that's with me now, all she like to do is kiss and sixty-nine
All she gets is time, shit, I ain't signed to TreyWay
Now, I'm falling in a downward spiral

I'm startin' to sound dated

I remember sprayin' Cris', hanging, playin' Hurricane Chris, ""Ayy, Bay, Bay""
Now I'm syrup sipping, can't sniff, playin' ""Dre Day""

Wishin' that I had one wish, playin' Ray J

N My Zone : Mask Off,The Bar Exam 4,2017.0,"The separation of talent and skill is one of the greatest misunderstood concepts for people who are trying to excel, who have dreams, that want to do things. Talent you have naturally. Skill is only developed by hours and hours and hours of beating on your craft


I've been killing microphones, killing microphones
I've been killing microphones, killing microphones
Nigga, I've been killing microphones, killing microphones
Killing microphones, killing microphones

I been like the zone
When you talk to me minimize your tone
Take some of that bass out your voice
Don't go and put your Energizer on
With this beef I'm going all the way
I don't mean to the end of night, come on
I mean I'mma take it to the grave, until end your life it's on
I'm talking about cracker-jacking these niggas
'Til their whole enterprise is gone
I'm talking about clapping at these niggas
With some shit that's gonna feminize you strong
I'm talking about tenderize the bone
I ain't talking about weird science though
When I say that my ceiling is probably gone
I'm talking about villainizing your home
Nigga, I been in like the zone
I'm looking like Rambo in this bitch
But nigga, I ain't feeling like Stallone
Feel more like I'm in a heist alone
Look, I don't like to aim my shit at any artist
When I'm writing I'm just generalizing
How am I gon' take a shot at something
I can't even fucking identify with?
I'm feeling like the long days away from feeling my Patrón
Used to have the coldest bitches waiting for me
Chilling by the phone
Used to do donuts on the grass
Now I'm just feeling like a drone
'Cause even though I'm sitting high somewhere
I'm still spinning by your home, bitch


I've been killing microphones, bitch, killing microphones, bitch
I've been killing microphones, killing microphones
Nigga, I've been killing microphones, killing microphones
Killing microphones, killing microphones

This a new life, who this? This a new phone, who this?
I'm in a new zone, who this? This ain't no Redbone and who this
I'm sorry, my top is unavailable right now
My roof gone, who this?
Nigga, my taste amazin, my chick look like the waitress from Hooters
And she about to fix me dinner
She independent, but she into niggas that's big spenders
And I'm into fitting this dick in her
And she into fitness like Brittany Renner
I used to chase the liquor with the Guinness
Move-making, nigga, with the business
With the winners in the bed with two majors
I still wake up feeling independent
I'm a savage, on top of that I'm a reckless product of D&D
Stop critiquing me, my detractors
Just couldn't sell a record to the DMV
I'm somebody, ain't nobody better than
My precise knowledge and intelligence
Well advanced, I swipe a knife across your white collar like a cheddar scam
I put your lights out like Edison
Ain't nobody out there ready for him
My blood type B positive, your type O like the credits wrong
I'm immune to all medic-on, blue Ferrari head is gone
Went from palladiums to colosseum stadiums
You perform in the Reddit forum
I spot a bitch nigga like Cyclops on Santa Monica
Got a model blowing my mind
My new Monica is blowing my harmonica
The car odometer is on the bottom
Of all the numbers like you dial star pound
Or put the car around white walls
Call 'em fire marshalls to come and shut the party down
I'm the leader of CMB, doing 52 over speed bumps
In front of your table with TMZ doin interviews while you eat lunch
I deal with mics real Kendrick-like, I'll kill a mic
Cash rules everything around me until I die
Looking right into the vanilla sky
I'm funny acting ""who this?""
You owe me money, run me that or do this
Get a running start, jump into a hole, take a 
hole in that beluga
I act like them older cats with moola
Dragging motorcycles past the light
With Kodiak on that Patrón, I'm hot and on cognac, I'm cooler
And I'mma show no reaction to your rollie flashing like my zodiac a jeweler
Ain't nothing but a dead something, 
I be headhunting, yeah, I'm going for that medulla
Boo-yah, don't be acting foolish
Baby, this a new phone, you yapping ""who this?""
Maybe everything I'm gon' say from here on then is gon' be on the behalf of ""who this?""
(Hello) This a new life, who this?
I'm on a roll like two dice moving
I'm on a boat in Dubai fooling
On the moped flute-by shooting
I'm an unapologetic work in progress
Product of a hard-working dedicated father with shortcomings
Praying all his sons make it farther
People say that it make you softer to raise a daughter, but it made me harder
Smarter with the way I make dollars just to make sure she stay a baby baller
The way I zone is like the AC on
I play like KC and KG, you can't even cage me
I be using Windows like I'm on a HP
Just look around, I don't own a thing that ain't in HD
I ain't interested in the crown that don't belong to Wayne, Shady or Jay Z
That's a opposite
You don't like your life, how about death?
You don't like to fight, how about sex?
You don't like the kind of car you drive, okay, how about Bow Wow's jet?
I got the kind of flow that destroy the place though
How about you take your shot at Rihanna like I did when I said ""hi""?
Or how about with Soulja Draco?
How about I come through and paint the floor with your whole crew?
How about the coroner come through and tell you go get Maaco
How about I don't give a fuck about burning bridges?
How about I walk through the fire 'cause I'm hot and I got the golden gate flow?
How about I box?
How about like Argyle
I sock niggas and give 'em disease like a irock
How about I hop out the Maybach and challenge every living emcee?",https://genius.com/Royce-da-59-n-my-zone-mask-off-lyrics

Field Negro,UnKnown,2019.0,"You ain't been gettin’ this money all your life
Oh you forgot about the roaches and all the mice
Out here livin' an alcoholic rapper artist life
What happened to art is life?
All of you kids is in charter school
And you startin' to do everything in private
Maybe that’s from all of the charter flights
Make sure whatever you're doing is not in the dark
You know this shit is bound to come out eventually
Underneath all the lights
Rob a man, kidnap him, take him for all his rights
Degrade him all his life, rape his daughter, his wife
Nine months later, use the baby as piranha bait
We wasn't even allowed to pray, let alone read or write
People like Cube opened them doors
And politically correct negroes like you
Close 'em to keep your ice
Clap for 'em, they make you feel like they love you there
Your whole platform could swim with the fishes
Like Huggy Bear

Your Maybach and your house is like that important that you won't move at all. It's distractions, that you won't say anything at all in risk of losing something. Right. You won’t say anything on anyone’s behalf at this point?

You ain't been gettin’ riches ya whole life
Oh, you done forgot? The oven door open
On the stove in the kitchen to heat up the house
'Cause they done cut the heat off on ya home, right?
Okay, now you thinkin' you livin' so far away
Just ’cause you neighbors with Britney and K-Fed
Every artist in the game are phony
Fuckin' all the same thotties in the game since way back
And all the same thots in the game been givin' the same top
To the same guys in the game like one of Sway hats
The plight of the miserable wasted talent
Only guys with the hits are the Tygas, Drakes and Khaleds, shit
This is what happens when your favorite artist never get challenged
Your favorite fella from the NFL has been silenced
My dad said, ""Under no circumstance should a man
Considered a legend have nothing left on his deathbed
And any black man not willin' to stand up for his own rights
Should lose the use of his right and left leg""
They say I couldn't do it, so I went out and did it
They said they gave it to me, so I ain't ask for more
I stayed active every time a door slammed in my face
Stayed at the door, I stayed knocking, I stayed rockin'
I did it my way without all the complainin'
And all the whinin' all day like Kanye or Wale
For the validation of all the bloggers
And all the same gay ass awards
Fuck y'all and all them gay ass awards
We are livin' inside the same hell
And we all willin' to die to go the same heaven
But we are lyrically not on the same level
I'm scribblin' my killings down and sendin' them out like chain letters
I'm not here for the crown nor Tory Lanez cheddar
I'm here for respect or else I'm willin' to take off the belt
And whoop a young nigga's ass with it like James Evans

A house negro look at you and say
""Man you crazy, what you mean separate?
Where is there a better house than this? Where can I wear better clothes than this?""
It was that house negro
In those days he was called a house nigga
And that's what we call him today, 'cause we still got some house niggers running around here

You only been livin' a small part of your life all the way up
Oh you forgot about your home that you grew up in
When you were starvin' with nothing, when it was stripes on all The canned goods in your closets and cupboards
You grew stripes and you developed the heart of a hustler
My grind Shawn Carter as fuck
I go back in time, sell George Washington Carver a nut
Plus, none of these artist can beat me
I'm Truman and Christ on the Noah's Ark on the waters of Fiji
I'm truly the type that'd push your wig farther than BC
Leave your brains all over the street
My heart's on my sleeve, put my seed in the Garden of Eden
And start a new species, please, you know my steez
How you got a team and you ain't got loyalty?
How is y'all the kings and you ain't got royalties?
I been around homicides since Marky D
Kool Rock Ski, you disorderlies, you know my steez

Children is dyin', women is cryin', we under attack, fool
What a better time to be famous, black and impactful
Name somethin' better to come together as one to react to
Shit we still comin' back from a checkered past like lumber jack suits
You play for the NFL, I just wanna ask you
If you don't kneel with Kaep, it's simple math
They cannot run it past you
Niggas innovate, people penetrate, exclamate
Off our inner hate
We oblige, so they make the riches, we don't rise
They just keep us high
Product of slave privilege, cop Ferraris to race a nigga
I do any job you can pay, if I can make a livin'
Vodka straight, a whole lotta pacin'
Just so I can make a decision
Keep a honorable spirit
With not a whole lot of faith to distribute
They took the scriptures away and replaced it
After makin' they own racist revisions
They crazy, basically they create shit just to play shit
To take away shit to rig it
I'm pretty sure they Maker is livid, they racist, they bigots
What's Christian about that?
The fakeness is vivid, the paper is printed
They should wake up every day
And pray to the nature of business
Fuck a Laker, I could never play for the Pistons
At the expense of creatin' division
The Wraith is exquisite, I'm 'bout that paper
But it's gon' prob'ly take me a minute
I much rather be a atheist chasin' my faith through a prism
Assumin' the information is real
Then play for a racist with a racist agenda
I hate you niggas, bow figures
The misappropriation of wisdom got you
Slaves to your own alienism, to pay a few bills, house nigga
I rather get hit with a Patriot missile
Than to be out here with ya exhibiting patriotism
They say a broke' clock is right two times
But it's never accurate
Truth time, okay
If some of us don't have time, some of us have time
Some of us perform in the halftime
Some of us boycottin' halftime
Some of us standin' up, some of us sittin' down
Reparations will never get back to us
They'll forever just laugh at us
I think I found a way for you niggas to face your truth
Go ahead and try to trace your roots
That shit is rather miraculous
Them niggas took away the message
And mess with the message in it
Embellish it just to spin it, just to sell that shit back to us",https://genius.com/Royce-da-59-field-negro-lyrics
I Don’t Age,The Allegory,2020.0,"Product of the dope game
Mama wanted no pain, Papa wanted cocaine
Papa smokin' pot over the pot, over the stove flame

Dollar short from acquirin' no change
Started out with no shame, to ridin' 'round in Mulsanne
Tolerance high, feel no pain
Cotton mouth with thots who got the code names
I remember nodding' out, too high, just watchin' 
Soul Train
Now I'm yachtin' out the boat brain
Hunnid thousand dollar gold chain
Wife done got too pricey for a Cadillac
Too icy to be fightin', too godly for a battle rap
Too nice to be in cyphers, too deep for moderation
Too free for exoneration and seekin' validation
Young, black, receivin' salutations

Product of the dope game
Mama wanted no pain, Papa wanted cocaine
Papa smokin' pot over the pot, over the stove flame

Flyer than the sky, I am the pilot of the soul plane
Writer of the 'pyro, I was a writer way before fame
All y'all dudes is cyber, 
I come from the bottom right by the soil where the rose came
I'm too private to try to expose lames
And I'm too violent to be ridin' with those thangs
I'm too shady to be neutral, these artists try to divide us
If I go Kendrick Lamar, the world gon' watch the ""Control"" change
I'm way too vicious to ask for my respect
I'm way too Michelin for the dissin', man, listen
Even mindin' my business I deal with entire sets
Always on time to collect, like the IRS

Product of the dope game
Nostril full of cocaine
Violence over dyin' over war games

Die here and get choked, lames
Die here in the choke chains
Advise you in the full, mane, Siamese, your whole frame
How can I be washed? I'm havin' shooter, rifle thoughts
Suicidal thoughts, I should be writin' these rhymes in the diary of Cobain
Beat him 'til his Bible lost
Beat him 'til he dies and then beat his body 'til we revive 'em and then his pulse came
Where I come from, I tell the jokes and you the joke
Where I come from, I sell the dope, you do the dope
My brethren, I'm not a legend, I'm not a vet
Do not address me as second, I'm the best
You niggas always sleepin', I'd rather stay woke
They say you are what you eat, but I never ate goat
I went from straight poor to shoppin' malls
And Wraiths blowin' gray smoke
Dialed in like conference calls
Strapped up like Waco
Playin' Hov, Friend or Foe
Lost friends like Ross and Rachel
In the road, big bro was a criminal
Give you L's, gimme O's
The only thing that look good on paper to me is Benji's, ho
My sobriety's been more faithful to me than these hoes
Never compromisin' my intellect for the Internet
Dissin' these goals in the Rolls
How the fuck is Nickel Nine a yes-man?

Look, I'm in a zone for reala
In a freezer with Medusa, I'm fucking a stone-cold killer
Your bitch vibing, I'm inside her and I tell your kids this:
Daddy's been doing more dick riding than Kari Wigton
I'm very venomous, 
you very innocent and
I will send a monster to your house, call him Harry Henderson
Oh my God, I was just in jail,
 then the
Devil caught pneumonia, and it made me sick as hell
You niggas counting me out can get the riches still
You're all in the Matrix, shoulda picked a different pill
You about to see how far that Paul Rosenberg will go
The height of my game is like DeMar DeRozan vertical
No one understands me, only one sicker than me is Em
I'm the new 'D' MC, it runs in the family

""Man why that nigga gotta bring Em name up all the time?
Man that nigga wouldn't even be rich without that nigga""
Shut up faggot!

I'm the magnificent with the sensational style
My wedding with the streets got the cake but no vows
I'm arrogant as fuck, who cares? You suck
Rappers talking about ""We the best"" have been to Paris too much
Who hot? Who sick? Shit, I'm like a Theraflu slush
Y'all ain't fly, y'all fallin' slow with the parachute up-up
I'm a face-slapper, niggas sleeping on an outfit
Call us Taylor Gang 'cept we Wake and Bake rappers
Slaughter/Yelawolf responsible for haters' actions
Y'all on Gilligan's Island, find a greater Captain
Ha-ha, victory laugh
Even my photographer's happy, picture me mad

I bust fly plus I'm about to put some wings on a Greyhound
My theory of you is: you lie and you drink beer
And I ain't hearing ya so you must be from Liberia
I wave bye like Hitler,
 100-round Thumper
Bulletproof what? You gon' need an underground bunker
I aim where you should go
I put my whole life on the net, even my weapons
I am Bazooka Joe, ugh
We the shit, nigga eat a dick
We'll make him eat his words, we the stones, he the sticks
I'm going yelling Shady everywhere
Smacking niggas' bitches with they lipstick and they baby with they teddy bear
To you and your man: ain't gon' be no Talladega Night

Stay Woke,Book of Ryan,2018.0,"Yeah, now you see what the Lord doin'
Rippin' pages out the book, I had to make the story fluent
Thanks to Marshall, I'm sober doin' what I enjoy doin'
I'm puttin Chavis Chandler on, had to at least pay it forward to him
Yeah, every other day another star is born
And that's to freshen the decayin' of the art form
Fuck with my commas, shit will be quick
Got what's in my pocket out of the dirt, filthy rich
I stuck to my promise to momma, stay focused
Double entendre, I'm tryna vocally smoke you, you will be missed
The hocus, the pocus, magician doing tricks in this miserable business
Who spit, loyalty, forgiveness through biblical scripts
Of morals and wisdom, paintin' pictures of this
Historical war of attrition who's just, the dopest, the wokest
I'm five years sober
Trauma from my childhood constantly haunts me 'til I finally cry tears over
Sharp as a gauntlet, with thoughts of my side chick in high heels
'Cause I didn't want her, I needed her, though I didn't want her
I'm hot as July, no lie, I wouldn't lie in a sauna
Invest in the truth, don't expect me to buy into moments
They done took the charts over so now y'all scared of them shook niggas?
Jamal Crawford couldn't crossover and sell me them Wolf tickets

Uhh, ""Best Rapper Alive"" broadcasts in five
Four, three, two, one

I’m fly as a dive in the sky in a harness
Anyone alive sleepin' on me can die in pajamas
Police call me a threat to society, though I am a promise
I am a one-of-one like I’d say a Isaiah Thomas
You can’t fathom thinking deep enough to sink the abyss
You think you Pac, I’m thinkin' of sinkin' your Demetrius Shipp
Only thing that I can’t fathom is why the preacher is rich
How to think in the moderation and turn a drink to a sip
I'm private when I fly, I ball out like 'Bron do
You in the game but you sit and coach like Tyronn Lue
Me and my soldiers, we just out here mobbin' like old Italians
Snatching your homie's necklace to rock it with your medallion
Over these groceries, I’m toe-to-toe with your whole battalion
I hit you with four from this .44 like Hova album
I take lives like banned contracepts
All the contraband I collect is Iran contra-esque
Respect the mantra or die at the hands of consciousness
Run up and get left ran down to death on your damn conscious steps
The booze already made me lose, I can't go out like I’m Amy Winehouse
The Lord graciously still kept me here in a place to be
On the corner like baby Blue standin' in timeout
Looking real spiritually aware, pair of Pumas on
Looking like I’m aboard a Lear, headed to uniform
I’m so lyrically rare, I spearheaded the unicorn

I was born a bold one, sugar-coated
All the way I'm livin' put me in a great position now
Every time they hear me, they say, ""Ain't nobody did this, nah""
And if they don't, they shit been off, just listen to the diction in this lyricism
I won't break a fool, they don't want me to blow
But every single show, they hand out like I owe 'em
Already paid my dues and wordings, uh
But if I said it then they still won't know, so I won't waste my time on you
And speakin' on the level that ya never on, the way they hatin' so incredible
My writings on the wall, to you, it's so illegible

I've been had the moves (been had the moves)
I got the moves since I got my studio (I got my studio)
I got confused (Hella confused)
I can't figure out for the life of me how I can lose
(how can I lose?)
How I can lose? (how can I lose?)
But I've been had moves (I got the moves)

I got I Decided on pre order, my lil homie just went gold
I hock a loogie on a reporter, Detroit is on Pete Rose
That's Armstrong on steroids, gated up no wing toes
My phones blowing up so much a nigga may end up like Cee-Lo
I bounce back like the fattest ass you can have attached to the fattest hips and anything after this shall be considered cataclysmic
Countin' packs like a statisician
Emphatic charisma
Savage enigma
I have a religion to handle your rhythm like cannibalism
The camera rollin' and it's time to flow
I don't know
I just go carnival
I'm from Motown you know
I can just line up the hollow tips inside the clip
And I can just go down the road
And knock 'em down like some dominoes
After you already out then I'm dropping some more like you 2Pac and the commandos
Watching my comments like papparazi watching Sasha Obama grow
I got Elijah Mohammed glow
I got the dough these rappers claim they got at the house in my drawer in the envelope
My focus phenomenal
My temperature so hot and cold I broke the thermometer
Guarantee I will kill the flow
This remind me of LaLa Anthony ass in that New Edition movie
Niggas tryin' to cover it up and make her look old
Guarantee I'mma still steal the show
I been had the moves
I remember these bitches was just a dream
Actresses and models I used to only see on television
Now they be climbin' out of my television lookin' at me to get the ring
I remember all I used to be around is dudes that used to try to just kill by me
Choppin' and conceal bodies
Used to clean up the bloody mess up in front of me
I had to holla at a tube
I had to still deal with that field sobriety
Had to do a double take at the dirty mop when he was finished
Looked like Lil Yachty
Nigga, I went to jail for the whole year
I got out and I did the same thing you wack ass rappers do when y'all got your little show here
I came right out to booze/boo's
Straight right out the news
Right off the cover of a magazine
Had the magazine with me at the club showing people like ""Look at this and please try not to drool""
I fuck a Stacy thick ass for all the days she used to make me work
And Tracy slick ass but not before I fuck April first
Translation I'm bout to fool
Y'all countin' me out well I got you
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, here I count for you
Biiitch

Last time took an 'L', now it's time to bounce back
(I been had the moves)
I was broke as hell, now it's time to bounce back
(I got the moves)
Every time I fail I got up and bounced back
(I been had the moves)
And nothing y'all can tell me about that bounce back


I’m doing this cause this what God want me to do
These lyrics is ordained by the Lord
You gon' get these bars
For free

It’s bad half and finally famous
The weapon’s Iranian
Y’all niggas is Pomeranian
My damie y’all Pootie Tang
Nigga I’m Damien
Shots drop from out of my cranium
My mind is Lebron drainin’ em
Five finger ring titanium
Already in your top 5
Now my dingaling now dangling
I’m flyer than Tom Chambers on the first NBA Live
Double pumping from the three point NBA line
On that war page with that 24 gauge
But when I double pump it I’m prime Chamberlain
Every track on the record got a background message
“We don’t back down ever!”
I’m putting the autobiographical book out with the Book of Ryan
I just let my bitch in LA read, now that sounds epic
My mind carries words
You couldn’t walk a mile in my patent leather Larry Bird black con weapons
I hope you know theres more fish that’s in the sea
I stole ya ho, we been kissing like we been sitting in a tree
And these ho’s in Detroit be trickin’ sooo much
They can completely gooo up a magician’s sleeve
You’re totally awesome
While I pour 40’s on corners for those we lost
My soul suffers from holy exhaustion
Trippin’ on opium just to cope with openin’ coffins
The devil sittin’ close enough to me to quote me an offer
Keep the union in unison like the Soviet’s marching
We goin’ iron for iron like a trophy in golfing
My nigga, better yet, I feel like the only man who can understand me is Sloth from The Goonies
Cause he retarded as fuck, on a boat with a treasure chest
That makes perfectly good sense
That’s exactly how my career went
Like a fuckin’ experiment
I got a lot on my mind that I gotta deal with
First of all, my favorite uncle died and favorite auntie died
I missed both of they funerals fuckin’ around with rappers
So every day and every night my conscience cries
I’m stressed out because my moms be tired, pops be workin’
And Lord knows I done threw enough dollars on the floor in the past for moms to retire
That’s why I be in the lab and my mind be wired
Trying to figure it out fast before my time expires
Man, but it’s this one thing that always on my fucking mind and it haunts me constantly guys
And that’s why in the fuck have I not at least tried to get in between Ashanti’s thighs
I’m feeling like a straight sucker I faced the vibration
My sober, righteous life only got a place for my lady
But maybe I can ask my lady for permission
She can give me a hall pass like Jason Sudeikis
This audio porn I’m giving with a bit of sense
A mind fuck if you will
I’m from Detroit but if I send you to the store with a large bill for some little shit
Bitch, I was born by a river in a little tent
Now I just ride with six vehicles with an ill tint
I’m cut from the kind of cloth that’ll never go outta style
With or without the internet my shit’ll still trend
That’s why I’m still standing with everything I came with
Cool as a Jacuzzi everything in me is built in
Nah, I don’t borrow I’d rather discuss loaning
I’m ready to go to war with whoever the fuck want it
Y’all weigh your respect against your release date
I’m just an artist dog I don’t know how to be fake
I don’t want no problems dog
I don’t wanna be apart of nothing with lies involved
I don’t want no phone that receives a thousand calls
I don’t need to be around a thousand smiling broads
With they hands out
Probably couldn’t survive without 'em all
But they can’t vouch for who the next sucker",https://genius.com/Royce-da-59-lets-take-them-to-war-freestyle-lyrics

You won't feel the clap, you'll only hear the noise
Ya'll got these hoes pegged so wrong while you hotel checkin'
I gotta pay these hoes just to keep their clothes on like I'm Odell Beckham
I'm flyer than a hat on Elroy
I just took it back to the Jetsons
I with the static like I got a Crooked I
Near an open exit with a bad connection
Cause no matter where you go
You're fucked if this rubber grip roll back in your direction
What you lookin' at? That's for your protection
This that rap on steroids, nigga, that rap on steroids
I just spit more clairvoyant raps
Than it take to make you half paranoid
Clap a gun at any day or night
Stand over his body then pray to Christ
Like ""you gave me life so I'm gon' throw you back one, dear lord""
I'mma throw back one like Fab on the 'Gram
Garage look like it's sponsored by Hasbro
Got the whole ave going HAM
Y'all don't know with what y'all are dealing

Being feared goes farther than any part of me having respect does
So I play to the tune of my own eardrum
While I'm out on my quest, love
I don't speak on behalf of myself, but my impeccable rep does
Christmas morning I remember waking up
Wishin' I could just go to sleep
Cause we only got like two toys a piece
I ask my pops did he do more for me?
He said ""yes, I got you clothes and heat
And let you keep a whole two rows of teeth""
Ha, I'm royalty
I took whoopings, I took losses, but no defeats
Been dropped, and been shelved with no release
Been in jail, no commissary or relief
But God looks over me like a cross and rosary
Rifle in hand, I let niggas have it, I won't hesitate
Stripes on the cans in the cabinet ""section eight""
My son got on them three-fifty boots Kanye West is dressed in Bape
Askin' me questions 'bout gettin' to second base
Uhh, wifey textin' SMH, house phone ringin' off the hook
Conference calls from record labels, guess I'm late
But, my other son's autistic, he wants my attention
This just might be my defining moment, let them wait

It's my time now, nigga; let them wait
Pick up the phone, tell 'em hold; let them wait
Old friends comin' to they senses tryna' reconcile
After I fell out with them, well fuck them niggas; let them wait

Wait, I'm here for that green, for that mula
You scheme, I see right through ya
I'm regal like Akeem, father King of Zamunda
One thing's for sure I think they do know
That me, and Porter, and Jake Uno
We don't play no games, no, we play sumo
We attempt to flatten into action
With all these average, flaccid defenseless rappers
I have no problem killing like sent assassins
They temper's bad when my temper's graphic
They hide or they fly while I'm high and flyer
I'm intergalactic, I've been spectacular
Flippin' like I invented spatulas, my lyrics is futuristic
I'm in here with my vintage ratchet with prints and scratches
My mental actually incapacitates fast as my passion
And pen surpasses my Aston
And leave a skid road in the street like I'm into smackin'
I fill my engine with acid
With my finger wrapped around a hair-trigger
That resembles lashes
I get into bitches quick and then I get distracted
I'm like the stock market, just like that, my interest crashes
Like a cymbal, my symbol should be expensive glasses
She with me, she an afro-centric nympho chick with her ass did
She callin' me back-to-back for a second date
While my ex is callin' for make-up dick, let them wait
Money all over the ground like Scotty from New Jack City
I weapon wave, everybody, step away
They said that we should go our separate ways in high school
Now they wanna jump the line in my shows, let them wait
My whole life they pressured me, let them wait
You rushin' me you rushin' excellence, let them wait
Police in my rear-view mirror with they sirens on
But I'ma call my lawyer first 'fore I pull over, let them wait

It's my time now, nigga, let them wait
Pick up the phone, tell them hold, let them wait
Old friends comin' to they senses tryna' reconcile
After I fell out with them, well fuck them niggas; let them wait",https://genius.com/Royce-da-59-wait-lyrics

Closest I'ma probably get to window shoppin'

Alright, we're gonna try a new sound

Uh, yeah, yeah (
Alright, we're gonna try a new sound

Say goodbye to the good guy
I hotboxed on your block and I got the whole hood high
You know who all the dead niggas is, they tryna look live
Instagram post bank accounts, it wouldn't look right
Your favorite rapper's sweet, you look up to geeks
I wanna flip the world upside down and make all you niggas look up to the streets
I don't believe none of you frail niggas
A man should never be described as petite
I don't wait when it's war, I'm on some now shit
Leave your mama prayin' over beef, I halal shit
All these foul styles goin' 'round and y'all allow it
No skill required, the game's overcrowded
So when a rapper say he can spit now, I doubt it
You could listen to Future but just know who the now is
I get to share a stage with Nickel Nine, that's crazy
We on tour with Eminem, baby, that's Shady
Room full of naked chicks, surrounded by pussy
'Cause I rap amazin', you at the crib hatin'
With your kittens, lookin' like the weird cat lady
Trippin' watchin Xvids while I'm with your ex-bitch, 'til I'm restless
Don't want me to send goons to investigate, they fold niggas
And believe me, it's hard to find a coffin that's pretzel-shaped
When goin' to the special place
Say an extra grace, black men in America ain't just slaves
Long as the queen don't need nothin' for  a seven
While I'm still buildin' credit outta debt
I know where I'm headed, I don't need the reverend

Hard,Layers,2016.0,"Everything is hard, hard, hard
I mean life is hard, bills is hard
Shit, it’s all hard (hard, hard, hard)
Got to get that out your mind
I want to think that hard, be real with yourself. College ain’t for you
In fact, I want you to take up a trade
You know, become a carpenter
Did you know Jesus was a carpenter?
She don’t want you. Getting in that girl’s drawers is hard
Remember that, boy, hard
Good luck, baby

Teacher, Teacher I don’t understand what you even wanna talk for
Unless an interpreter’s gon' come up there and talk for me
Because we don’t speak the same language, you say shit like “take up a trade and your thoughts bore me”
You don’t teach me nothing, you just talk towards me
I’m gon' need your assessment and fast
Look around you, do I look anything like the rest of your class?
Can’t you see that I’m special?
I don’t act like these fucking crumb snatchers
I don’t even breathe like ‘em
I was born with my lungs collapsing
I walked right up to the drug dealer in my class and asked him
“How did you get such a bad bitch?”
He said “it was hard and the best ones are the hardest to get”
And I went on to see the world, and he went on and started the trick
And now when I see his girl, she be on my dick

I guess fucking the baddest bitches around wasn’t hard as I thought
Man, what the fuck was I thinking? (Get Money)
Jewelry and cars (cars, cars, cars)
Achieving the highest level of success ain’t as hard as I thought (top the world)
What the fuck was I thinking? (I was drunk)
I was drunk or I was lost (You was lost) (Yeah)
My people said it would be hard (Hard, Hard)
My teacher said it would be hard (Hard, Hard) (It’s gon’ be hard)
What the fuck was she thinking?
Why did I listen to y'all?
What the fuck was I thinking?

My finest hour is here, this is what I see in my prayers
This is me, though I’m facing all of my fears
Making all my enemies look in the mirror
And see the meme of the Jordan face with all of the tears
What most of you analysts ignore, it’s my explosive animal allure
I went away to get in the way of my wife planning a divorce
Handled it and came back more talented than all these rappers
Though I’m DiCaprio, all they have on me is the awards
I’m a Steinway grand piano, they’re Casios
, I will kindly pass them the torch
The day that one of them are able to hold a candle to my corpse
I’ll put a hand on your whore, even if she ain’t my type
And this song is inspired by 
Broadway play called Hamilton
 I saw that changed my life
Right away, so my next move is to either screenwrite a movie or write a play

I said fucking the baddest bitches around wasn’t hard as I thought
Man, what the fuck was I thinking? (Get Money)
Jewelry and cars (cars, cars, cars)
Achieving the highest level of success ain’t as hard as I thought (top the world)
What the fuck was I thinking? (I was drunk)
I was drunk or I was lost (You was lost) (Yeah)
My people said it would be hard (Hard, Hard)
My teacher said it would be hard (Hard, Hard) (It’s gon’ be hard)
What the fuck was she thinking?
Why did I listen to y'all?

I’m looking like the black Bond in Africa
Hotel room look like a beautiful crime scene, in fact it’s a
Spectacular Halle Berry, Vivica
 
massacre
Left behind by a serial bachelor
Fall back, y’all, I really don’t fall back enough
You’re not gon’ not sound soft to us
The shotgun will throw a box of black balls at ya like Count Chocula
That last line, I was just on my Pharoahe Monch
Rappers, kneel before me like I’m trying to prepare a punt
I’ll cut your body up and put it in two different cars
Put it in the river, have you swimming in a pair of trunks
Momma asking when I’m coming to the church
My little brother asking for the Aston
I threw the keys to him like I’m fronting up some work (Ha, good looking, Nickle)
I used to not be a trendy guy
Now I probably got more pairs of Balmain jeans than Wale and Envy got
Ah, somebody pinch me
Pardon me

Teacher, teacher, I’m so sorry I’m late
I’m Lyric Montgomery’s father, I’m here for Career Day
(Hi, Mr. Montgomery)
Can I talk to the kids?
Hello, children, how was your day?
I’m Royce Da 5’9”, and over the years
I’ve been blackballed
I’ve been in jail
I’ve seen lives turned
But guess what I’ve learned?

I learned that fucking the baddest bitches around wasn’t hard as I thought
Man, what the fuck was I thinking? (Get Money)
Jewelry and cars (cars, cars, cars)
Achieving the highest level of success ain’t as hard as I thought (top the world)
What the fuck was I thinking? (I was drunk)
I was drunk and I was lost

And you know what else
Everybody asking me just because I'm a lyricist in this business
How come I haven't gone broke yet?
I tell 'em it's cause I'm the flyest backpacker ever
I'm flyer than Mos Def in a Trump tower surrounded by four chefs
Fixing him some salmon croquettes with 
Kendrick, Cole and Kweli
In their Jidenna clothes, try me, you and your crew will bleed
Y'all bums ain't shot for the stars since New Years Eve
Nothing was given to me
I had to go upside heads just to get upside hills
Never over the hill though, so I don't strike when the iron is hot
I strike whenever the fuck I feel
I eat what the fuck I kill
I got this way from not being allowed to eat dinner
If you knew how much I've lost, you'd have no problem with me winning
How many times could I be reinvented?
Money is the deadlier of the five venoms
, in my denim
Definitively got a wad in 'em, garages with cars in 'em
Hanging out in bars to have menages with bartenders
God was an artist and Jesus was a carpenter
They put me together like an easel in the darkness of hell
And lost it and left me some loose screws, but
These are the nails to your coffin
These are the folk tales of a starving artist
Battling demons through his notepad like Adam and Eve eating kale in the garden
Flying private away from all charges",https://genius.com/Royce-da-59-hard-lyrics

Presenting to you, the President of the United States
The bullet being lodged an inch away from his heart, Reagan is launched into the operating room, and tells his doctors, ‘I hope you’re all Republicans.’

Cash rules everything around me
I ain’t claiming I’m street
I’m just saying everything that surrounds me is concrete
In the bubble-eyed ride all because I bubble like Don P
Right beside me’s a dime piece, college girl looking ‘bout as good as I sleep
That’s cause I keep it low, the opposite of high key
Y’all niggas got the wrong idea ‘bout what’s really going on, out here
Y’all weird, I see, they told you, ‘Keep your ears to the streets’
Y’all niggas laying down and y’all ears out here in these streets
I guess you took it literal
Guess the only code you live by’s forget-it-code
Uh, if I should get my own guilty verdict
May the next man learn from it, then flourish
You could put it on the news, you could put my face on the front of a shirt in the latest video, then blur it
Y’all niggas fucking with the next nigga, bitch
Mostly attracted to her cause she the next nigga bitch
One of my niggas made a name for killing niggas
Now he on the slayin' spree for Dilla niggas, I call it the nigga nitch
Life is set up for you to dig a ditch
God is looking down on all, being carried by the crisp pallbearers
Like, just ball, player
You ain’t even gotta pull a trigger, you can still assist
Imma keep it real as this

When being silent exposes, and when it’s golden
Got to know all the got to knows
Got to know all the got to knows

God made us niggas, then made us all breakable
Then gave us all decision making that’ll make or break a nigga
People tryna blaze with you, just so they can lace a nigga
All because of public sensationalism
With brothers with faces that people see and can relate to
When the place where the foundation of eating’s
Higher population is based on popularity
Gotta be careful where you place your wisdom
All it takes is just one conversation where you unbeknownst to the fact you’re talking to an abomination
At the wrong place, at the wrong time, with the wrong crime taking place
That’ll put you away for a long grind, where it’s locked
Where it’s not safe unless you know them combinations
Yeah, it’s just a way a man to be taken by the same thing that took his brother
We don’t learn from each other, we learn to look the other
Way when one of us in trouble
That karma looking to catch you, it’s patient
It’ll wait till you think you would love to come get you
Cause  it know that women been the downfall of men ever since pussy was discovered
Dearly beloved, you soul searching for nothing
Just follow the instincts the lord versed you with, historically
That feeling that you get in your gut been getting ignored more than that poor person
Who’s living under the gun in this cold, cold world that we live in
That’s under the imminent control of the consumer and indigenous war merchants
More religion and more churches, doctors, more nurses
Cause it’s the American way to make anything that’ll finish you or drop you, for purchase
Who said I couldn’t buy my way into heaven?
All I need is a bottle, a couple dollars, a couple people that’ll keep me company
And who love misery as much as me
You got to know your pedigree, got to be yourself at all times
Your true self at all times ain’t gon hesitate to let you know when you should let it be
A lot of these brothers done died tryna follow their pride
Gotta know the alert signs, them butterflies as reliable as your first mind, genetically

Merry Go Round,Success Is Certain,2011.0,"I have tried in vain, never had success
So it seems my life is nothing but a mess
I have lost, my only friends
Now it seems I have to start again, merry go around

My life's been going around 'n' round since '95
Went from going somewhere to about to die
Went from calling my chick a chicken
Cause she look like she got poultry around her thighs
To calling your piece a chicken cause she got no teeth
And she got crow feet, around her eyes
How hard are y'all? I got a heart the size of Arkansas
Count to five, these birds gon' hit the ground and they ain't from out the sky
Went from having an outta-this-world-flow, to doing a video doing the coon dance
To watching' my good friend Eminem winning' a moonman
I remember cause I was in New York with all of my boys to start shit
Letting 'em stay with me, long story short, they tore up my corporate apartment
Went from being a kid addicted to basketball
To being an ignorant nigga addicted to alcohol
Round and round we go is how this movie would end
Self-proclaimed King of my city, not really just truly the King of losing a friend
Who woulda thought this dude in the park who's true to his art would lose
Or win just by giving his thoughts and views

I have tried in vain, never had success
So it seems my life is nothing but a mess
I have lost, my only friends
Now it seems I have to start again, merry go around

You would hear that Ryan's skilled might even hear Ryan kills
You will never hear Ryan Stills, here to put the ""i"" in ill
My mind is still like a merry-go-round spill
Like leaving only guns to my kids when I'm killed, I got an iron will
Intellect of Zion, 
I done went too high on pills
To triumph, to hiding from bills, to buying buildings
Then I went from writing for Dre to wondering if my head was on straight
On the sidelines feeling forgot about listening to ""Forgot About Dre""
From there I went to about a bottle a day
Telling who we know ""Get outta my face!"" 
okay I know what Kino said about Dre
I look at Kino to this day like that was a stupid mistake
But if it wasn't for him doing that, what would I be doing today?
If it wasn't for Cashis saying that he gonna beat my ass
Then me and Em probably wouldn't be laughing 'bout us getting past it
If it wasn't for me being outcasted I woulda never been on the underground rapping with SLAUGHTERHOUSE!

Legendary,Book of Ryan,2018.0,"A woman's loyalty is tested
When her man has nothing

This shit here gon' make me legendary
Make me legendary
This shit here gon' make me legendary

Pardon, nigga, I'm the hardest nigga out
The farthest nigga out the party nigga, I'm the artist
I put all these niggas in the garbage
All these niggas in the toilet
While I sit in orbit, I'm not getting better
I'm just getting started, started I'm just getting
I just flipped it like I do all my competition
Let me slow this shit down
I just need me a bad one
Come over here and wear my flag hon'
I give y'all the bottom line, I don't do a lot of talkin'
Cause a lot of talkin' take up a lot of time
And I don't got a lot of time
Since a kid sittin' in the wicker chair
With the sweater with the collar out of mine
I swore a lot and swear to promise to cut the line
Swear not to get out of line
I can't have 'Pac in my closet, I don't got time to idolize
I just cop it and toss it
I don't got time to itemize, my flight is high
Probably the only thing around me tonight that's high
Besides my I-D-E-O-logy
Pockets chubby, I should say tubby
'Cause I'm ballin' like Dr. J
Wonderin', ""How could they sub me?""

I ain't tryna fuck every bitch that's tryna fuck me
That shit right there just ain't necessary
All I'm tryna be is legendary
That right there won't make you legendary
I remember I was just a pimp
Save all that extra shit
You bitches' neck'll twist quick as The Exorcist
Just tryna catch a glimpse, bitch I look excellent
Soon as I exit, I peel out advantage
She try to look hard 'cause her ride lookin' small
We will suit up and boot up and get out like Mexicans
All you niggas do is party all the time
Party all the time, party, party, party
Once you my target, I'll stop you while you're startin'
Started, why you stoppin'? My niggas clock around the party
Around the clock, wearing choppers 'round the .40
And rocket launcher down the block
Mwah! And they ain't got no lawyers
That gon make 'em fuckin' legendary
That's gon make you fucking legendary
Beautiful women asking ""When we gon' get together?""
I told all 'em bitches ""Nevuary""
Now all them baddest bitches know to never come to me with nonsense
'Cause they know that I will fuck 'em once
Like a record company then drop 'em
Hold up, that's that shit gon make you legendary
That shit gon make me so, so, so legendary
'Specially if she acting suspect
And the pussy just end up being so, so
I'm just a superhuman being with the quickest slow flow

Cold as ice, I’m a living refrigerator

I don’t mean that I’m dating the tennis player
I’m on Saturn where you don’t matter
Alone, I’m past the zone where your phone scatters
Hello? Can you hear me now?
You don’t got a fucking choice
I elbowed my way into everybody’s conversations
With rhyming, timing and patience, now I’m in space, bitch
I used to have to be on some ""watch what I say"" shit

Say what you wanna say but stick to the facts, it’s all good

They say a closed mouth don’t get fed
I say a closed mouth don’t give head
On the flip side, know a closed fist don’t get bread
And if you swing it then you gon’ get lead
Boy I put ‘em in a panic, got ‘em all frantic
Overlook my antics, you’ll see that I’m a throwback
Hip hop Stan Smith, but it lessen my love
'Cause the so-called rulers ain't quite measuring up
Now let me give the chicks a message
Bitter exes'll tell you that the dick is precious
Three words, get over it
And if you speak mine, mention I could trip over it
Low key like my name too big for the bill
Betty White style, get it in, still
Plus I’m on the high you can’t fit in the pill
But I try anyway, we gon’ die anyway, ya heard

I’m on my own planet, I’ll do my own thing

Drop tough like a built Tonka
Still conquer, but they still ain't contra
Still pop you through your shield, holla (Boo)
I wasn't in the room, but on the mini scooter
Or lickin' hooters with a spliff for Buddha
I was in the inner city sewer, underground dirty-dirty, in the manure
Clip in the Ruger 'cause I was raised different than you were
Nigga, I'm awesome, get off 'em, you all dumb
You all wonder where I get all of my ambience from
You all wonder how I come from the swamp and the pond scum
Peon, comparin' me to y'all is beyond dumb, biatch
Me, I'm from where it's dark as Hell
'Round the corner from death, right across from Hell
I am Austin Wells tossed in a garbage pail
I'm from the bottom not from Harvard or Yale, darlin'

Uh, prolly took a shot, even shot a few too
Now my future bright, lookin' out is futile
My mom was frugal, my pop was brutal
School of hard knocks, all I did 'round the clock was doo-doo
On the block all day and night like a prostitute do
Every artist out there y'all like on the charts are doo-doo
I'm from where thots'll convolute you, the cops are cuckoo
Charge you, try you and prosecute you, if not, just shoot you
Knock off your whole tribe with the chopper like Shaka Zulu
Chef the impossible, opposite pyrex pots are voodoo
Block magician, I chop a brick to a pasta noodle
Fuck the charts, I roll out, I swapped the old out and copped the new-new
This is my possible moment of truth, shouts to Guru
Cocked the Glock, let it do the do like cock-a-doo-doo
Hospital, nah, growin' up only doctor you knew
Was Dr. Dre, Dr. Jay, and maybe that Dr. Drew dude
I was raised by Gregory and James Evans, dawg
I catch you without that weapon, that's Frank Drebin, dawg
That's naked, dawg, that's sacred, dawg
I spray your dawg, that's aerosol, let's face it, dawg
I Che Guevara, dawg
Y'all make mistakes, not me, I create eras, dawg
I play forever, dawg, ever-ever, dawg?
Ever-ever, dawg, ever-ever, dawg?
I play forever, dawg, never lost
Record of wins and lessons, y'all
Too effortless with the rhetoric to be a legend dog
As far as the bars and measures
I'm prolly highly regarded as God up in Heaven, dawg
I play forever, dawg
I play forever, dawg
Far as the art, I'm what else but Magellan, dawg
Hella bars, Nelson Mandela, dawg
Draped in Maison Margiela, dawg, they jealous, dawg
These niggas fake, I'm the eight kissin' the figure eight
Playin' Drake at a weddin', dawg
Put that together, dawg, I'm clever, dawg
I play forever, dawg, ever-ever, dawg?
Ever-ever, dawg
These sessions are blessings, dawg
Clever thoughts comin' out the barrel of G Dep Smith & Wessons, dawg
These thoughts are the confessions, dawg
Ever, dawg, I play forever, dawg

No lie, no, no lie

Pray,Layers,2016.0,"(Let us pray)
Dear Heavenly Father, thank You for watching over us today. I pray for the sick and  and for those who have lost loved ones. Lord, I pray for the homeless. Lord, I pray for our soldiers and their families. I pray for everyone here today...

God taketh away, and God giveth
The clock's tickin' away as the plot thickens today
Cause I'm sippin' hard liquor
We couldn't suffer the same amount of losses
Cause my supply's bigger
Don't associate me with nothin' but that dopest child star shit
That Lindsey Lo', that Todd Bridges
Hit your block with a tickin' bomb that'll
Leave the competition in the hospital
I'm the product of foolish pride
I'm a speeding bullet who responds to the pull of God's trigger
Jumpin' out the barrel, like ""Excuse me, Nas. Move aside, Jigga""
I'm hard as proving ground bricks
Groundbreaking each time I spit words and they hit the street
You don't like the game, you can google my dick, bitch

And that goes to everybody
I pray for foes, I pray for hoes
I pray for everybody
But you can pray for them
If you gon' pray for somebody, pray for them

Don't pray for me, pray for Paris
Pray for Nigeria, pray for peace
Pray for your marriage
Pray your horse don't sway far away from your carriage
Why you put all of your eggs in one basket?
Blowin' dumb cash on Wraiths and karats
Your daughter ain't an heiress, I hope she's taken care of
More importantly, I hope this gun in your face don't end up in your mouth
I'll make you taste the terror of the kickback of this gat that could break the barrel
More court cases, hate betrayal
If I approach thee, boy, please take me serious
Cause if I say that I shall, then I shall proceed
I don't cry wolf cause I don't enjoy wasting tears any more than I enjoy wasting shells
I looked at the state of my health and asked the reverend 'bout it
I didn't just pray for myself, I prayed for everybody

But you can pray for them
They need you more than me, pray for them
Pray for everybody

Look around, look around, look around, look around
Pray for everybody, tell me exactly what you're seeing
I'm seeing children being murdered by police and then acquitted on all charges
It's like they're all targets, pray for them
Pray for everybody

Live from the gutter, my father's a drugger
The block is my mother, 2Pac got it on lock in my suburb
I got dope double-wrapped up in bubble wrap on top of my cupboard
Old ladies watching from shutters
Tellin' all the children keep watching out for us
Bad influences, we the gumbo that you see inside the pot
Swimming 'round in all the saddest, truest shit
Addict in the coolest whip
Riding 'round my city lookin' for the baddest newest bitch
Hammer in my stash, feeling too legit
90 on the dash, slammin' on the gas
Passenger mad, saying that the break pedal do exist
I'm saying ""I'm late man, I got school to skip""
Introduce me to your chick, I turn this shit to a Skip to My Lou assist
I don't talk too much shit, I discuss shit by throwing hands
I'm a sucker for hoes in yoga pants
Tell my queen I'm in this shit, like kissing and holding hands
I keep my flings on the other end of a string with swollen glands
I'm a player, I've been to every hotel and every lobby
Every time I pray, I send up a prayer for everybody

Don't pray for me, nigga
Pray for them
You gon' pray for somebody?
Pray for them

Don't pray for me, pray for respect
Pray to get something different from rich and away from your debt
Nigga, I'm straight to cassette
Y'all digital, y'all about as physical as finger under some balls, coughin' while taking a test
Too many artists get mistaken with best
Cause they on the charts, you sleepin' on me, I'll come and wake you to death
While I pray against all the violence and shootin'
ISIS got Obama sittin' down with Vladimir Putin
I saw a child online ask his father ""Why did they do this?""
His father then replied to him, ""We gotta fight 'em with flowers growing out the ground""
I look at violence the same way I look at slavery
It's never ending in light of abolishment
These are my finest hours, then
I pray for everybody

Look around, look around, look around, look around
Pray for everybody, tell me exactly what you're seeing
I'm seeing children being murdered by police and then acquitted on all charges
It's like they're all targets, pray for them

C. Delores,The Bar Exam 4,2017.0,"""It is obscene, it is obscene, it is obscene.""
""In 1992 the Canadian Supreme Court ruled that it was more important to ban speech that is dehumanizing to women than to protect free speech.""
""Now we see the direct and indirect effects. We see the rise in murder, in abuse, in battles, teen prostitution, and teen suicide. We hear the wailing mothers, the grieving sisters, the tormented brothers and fathers, and children planning their own funeral with pink dresses and pink caskets.""
""If the filth that is portrayed in these gangsta rap videos and art is not obscene then I submit that nothing is obscene.""

We started off as targets
We had the Congress mad at the whole genre
Tryna get rid of us
Now it's like we not even trying to be good
It's like we just sitting ducks in the eyes of evil
I open windows with hopes that the wind blows you ten mo' blessings
Set my Timbo's next to my dresser with the  Nintendo, and yes
The extendo's on the AK 47 and it's wrapped in the dresses of En-Vogue
It's time, it's time to move something
I guess we missed our window to try to prove something
Spot a whack producer from across the room
Walk up to him, smack his hookah across the moon
Break a platinum plaque over a rapper back
Go and toss that bitch into a dark lagoon
Go into the heart of the art form with a harpoon
They ain't skilled enough to stand the field with us
You gon' have to retire me
It's only like four or five of you rappers who can actually inspire me
I be out here telling the truth
I should sign my autograph with a polygraph
I move in silence tryna get to you 'fore you could brace yourself
Cause I'm tryna put yo' ass in a body cast
Y'all niggas lollygag, not me
This evening I'm with the biggest spenders having the most prestigious dinner
You eating Church's Chicken with suspicious fictitious sinners
I'm a living legend, you a fidget spinner
I'm getting cheddar, they tryna catch up to my past M's
And I'm getting better quicker, tryna catch up and pass Em'
I be blacking out, you could ask them
Everything I spit be sick, gag phlegm
Everything I wear be tailor-made to fit, Giraffe trim
Huh, it seem like everybody out here right now wanna be 'Pac
While I'm zoning, stirring the pot
I'm 'bout to go so motherfucking Lamont Coleman
This 'bout to be disturbing to watch
While I'm out here swerving the drop
Your favorite rapper 'bout to get cleaned up, served in a box
Like laundry detergent, pushing 'round these birds with a mop
Tryna stay in a genius, creative state of mind
Tryna stay sharper than straight sharks in a 'gator pond
Grate her down, all for the greater good and the greater grind
While they denying now, all these heathens be crying 'bout
Taking care of two, three dudes but these people be lying
We keeping it G, we keeping the iron out
They feed negativity, we eating vagina while
Keeping it Zion, we turning the streets of Detroit to a D zoo
Eating while we feed people to lions
The dude that I brought with me psycho and schizo
He think that he Luke, he like to lift you and make you skywalk
You don't wanna play with none of his make-believe truth
They'll make the iron speak too
He'll do the R2D2 to your heart
Until it's parts of a easel
Threw a piece of your heart in a jar for the people
To dissect at Juilliard
I'm the best at who we are, that's fucking food for thought
Nobody else been thinking like me thus far though
Subpar cerebrals

""For 400 years, profit came before principle.""
""We marched for our rights to Selma, I was there with Dr. King.""
""—music that glorifies and promotes violence with guns, knives, or drugs—""
""—and that includes all this gangsta rap—""
""—that's it—""
""—we march again and we're gonna keep on marching and demonstrating till it...""

I make your mouthpiece obese like Della Reese
While I'm flipping pies like Patti LaBelle, Sara Lee
Eating all the bark with Gargamel off of the cherry tree
King of the dark art, all is pale compared to me
Let the hail from the evil word flip hath fury
While hip-hop stay colorful fruity like RiFF RaFF jewelry
I enter into a different intuitiveness on instruments
I just whiplash new beats
You just the next wave to catch a crazy catchphrase
I'm just a neck brace to the next crazy contestant who should step to me, neck pain
Tell paparazzi I'm charging sales tax to media
In order to picture these digits, press will have to capture Loch Ness
On the back of a hellcat or capture a meteor
Me, I left from the frying pan like the Devil's last ingredient
While Jesus wept I made boss music flunkies relate to
Better each time I came through like I held back the previous
Look, I'm the real thing
These niggas just here to provide dangerous detail
If any of y'all MCM's is any flyer than me there
These niggas listen to sign language, probably speak braille
Me, I'm just about to stick my dick in the dirt
Either that or a model, these Ether raps are the Bible
I'm gon' relapse for a bottle or be in the absence of Godot
Relax for a throttle
One of the last living rap forefathers who wouldn't ask for a dollar
My style lethal ferocious
Streaming out your club when your single drop
Like a single drop of blood off the beak of a vulture
Uh, I broke my key off in the car door
Just as I was on my way to score a quarter key off Artmore
I'm an angel at squalor
My threshold for pain goes farther than a marine who's been ordered to war
So at 3:45, which, by the way, is a quarter to four
Somebody ask me for change for a dollar
While I spray your ass with four different fours
More layers than 44 sorting couture
Vocabulary lords sicker than Herbie's recording thesaurus
The Virgin Mary took a morning-after pill the morning before fornicating the Lord
They gave birth to me 44 days later drinking a 40 at the corner store
Therefore, this is more than just my dormitory
This is the safe place I come to look Benjamin in the face
So when you gon' end up getting ate like four and four
Icicles is made of blood-boiling water alluring gore
I'm here to combine all three Bar Exams for a fourth
While I shoot the shit as deep as foul goes though, so it's four to four
While driving a Ford wondering why guys look at me foreign for

Can I talk my shit? Y'all niggas confidence dropping

Somebody told me I'm prolly dying, but I ain't listen
By the time it could harm me, I'll prolly die by a trigger
So I'm only going cold turkey right after Thanksgiving
I paint pictures between blank scriptures
Now, just how contradictory is it that I pray?
The name's Royce and I be poppin' so much pussy
Dwight Howard look at me sideways
And while the bitches try to grab all on my dick
I can't even get my own nigga to rap on my shit
You form a clique, it should be sacred, I shouldn't say shit

Tryna get a payday like a nut bar
Tryna get my own island, fuck cars
I'm without a bus card, living in demise
The record label pimpin' him, cause the raps he be givin' 'em
He can actually deliver them and make a
Motherfuckin' ribbon in the sky
I guess I'm just a specimen with the literacy, special ability
I'm characteristically raised, for everything still paid for
Embarrassed niggas like Kimbo with the steel cage flow
No time to take it in, yet, I'm still thankful
I don't discriminate, I take it in pesos
Tryna to close my curtain, I was in Capers
Now I'm insured by the street, now my stint paid for
Stickin with the papers
Sticking to any shit that I say, bro
This is the Vince Staples
I clearly only target the bosses
Whenever we arrive at your office
I definitely body your authors
I'm Martin Shkreli, everybody audit the auction
About it and cautious, a product of losses
Living modest, dealing with problems
That the cars in his closet is costing
Niggas hearts turn into jelly the second that they have to part with their celly
Live life behind real bars
They don't know what it feels like to have a real fight
At night in the dark with your celly
Never take advice from the jealous
Watch your man, even if you got to watch him take an L'ie
You still gotta stand by him like you Omelly
The white girl got you bugging out like Liza Minnelli
My car's on fire, the tires Pirelli
I'm Martin and Eddie
Searching for Taral Hicks
Not to give her a baby, but to put a life in her belly
I'm barbaric with the nine and all
Am I in everybody's top 5? Not at all
You could find a nigga name in the ladies room
On a lot of walls, topic of vagina monologues
I write a lot of bars, that's why I'm poppin' like an adderall
I'm duplicated, more than Audemars
If you could take the beef home with you
You could make a goat out of ours
If you can take the bars and the rhymes home you can make a soap out of ours
These are breaks you had to be casted
Fatality to flattery flaccid
You bleed blood, I leak battery acid
There's no wrath that you can accurately battle me after
I'm that great
After Adam and Eve ate the apple
I evaporated, came back a cadaver
You can't assassinate me
Name: abracadabra
Guns is named Latimer
Got the little kids doing dirty things in the hood for me
I ain't talking about the same as the Vatican
If it ain't immaculate it ain't adequate
I heard your dog switching genders, ain't that a bitch
Banana clip on an automatic, take that and split
This that lyrical, acrobatic, straight savage shit

Straight savage
Straight savage
Ant Man what's up
Let's go get these niggas

The whole hip hop game need a rap lift
Surgery to the trolls and the catfish
Say my name five times, I'm showing up to your home
To your computer room and your blow up little mattress
In the big black whip
Let your bitch lick my dick sack five times and take her to Saks Fifth
Everything that I say is like an eighth in a trap sittin'
Just waitin' and wrapped in plastic for a rapper to come and take it and spaz ‘til he pass away
She fucking with you
She definitely could fake an orgasm
She fucking with me
She definitely could take a giraffe dick
And I'm just hustling like I'm at a cabaret
Straight savage
Anywhere I'm goin' land is the exit
If it ain't lavish
I'm my own man like Stedman
I took my life into my own hands same way I take matters
Listening to Coltrane on average
With a no name bad bitch
Took her to my home, laid it down on the table
In powder same way cocaine gathers
Oops, I mean pounded her
You can either get down with us
Or let the ground come up and get you like Hank Gathers
Niggas think they've seen the things that I've seen
Just cause we on Instagram in the same glasses
Just cause we in the YSL same jacket
Don't mean that we're cut from the same fabric
What the fuck, is you high as hell?
You know nothing about the iron in the tire well
All you know about is the obvious shit
Like Kanye riffing or what? He'll probably yell
And I bet you probably one of the old creeps helping Kylie Jenner little body sell
Mermaids, water, good diver skills
Sandwiches in the Desert with a side of mayo
Transcriptions in the present got a lot of mail
Still getting money off the books like Galileo
I'm in the Panamera listening to Pantera
The bitch with me, sipping on caberna and 
I keep a narcotic in the car by the teaspoon
I give her a G-Unit, I hear she a fan of Yayo
I got to roll with a gat in the back
I get pulled over and they ask who I am
Oh, because the Aston is black?
I tell them I'mma poet cause it's a dead giveaway
That I'm much more than just a Cat in the Hat
I be laughing at your guys while laughing at you
If you ask who I am nigga, I'm laughing at that
I'm a bullseye for time to laugh and attack
Kiss my ass and after that I put your ass in the crack
Speaking of crack rock, my pocket line with that
You could step on my pocket and break your momma back
Every weapon of pound I got is Floyd Mayweather
Doing a movie definitely ready to counter act
Got your bitch jumping 'round on the boat
Looking like when flounder flap
And it ain't because she found a map
We savages
If your bitch with us and you call her and she tell you that she tied up
She might be literally bound and gagged
I'm sick, I'm sick and permanent
Like the doctor opened me up and found a mask
Close me up, left inside of me an ounce of hash
I exercise for dumbbells hanging onto the gun rail
While I'm pressing up piles of cash",https://genius.com/Royce-da-59-savages-lyrics
Vagina,The Bar Exam 3: The Most Interesting Man,2010.0,"We holla at 'em like

These niggas talkin' bout they walk, talk, and think bossy
I'm in the Trump Tower shower washin' ink off me
Two ugly bitches in my bed, moochin' drinks off me
My mini bar's empty, but that's just how I'm livin'
I'm in the presidential suite with two freaks
I call 'em my Kennedy Fried Chickens
(""Aww, yeah, I'm back, bitches"")
But this is, kinda like my wilder style, vicious
Say when I'm sippin', I turn into Shallow Hal
I must have been high or somethin' cause I could of swore
That one of these bitches told me to buy her somethin'
I told her 
(""I got a present for you right here"")
 (What?)
(""Actually it's not a present, it's my penis"")
I'm feelin' plastered, so what they fat women
I feel like I have to bite the Apple like the Mac emblem
One of the bitches like, ""Oh, I love you so much
I love Slaughterhouse, I love Joey, Joell, Crooked, all you guys""
Shut up! ""I don't like it when you talk"" (What?)
""Cause that just means you're not suckin' my cock""
Bitch I'm on everything
, I don't know what you just had
I'm 'bout to slip and fall and head butt your ass like Superbad
One of 'em started suckin' me super fast, 
the other one
I gave Arabian Goggles,
 they flier than alien model, for now
These bitches givin' me brains until I'm out of mines
That's when I had an epiphany like (Stop!) Vagina time

""Vagina"" (What?) ""Vagina"" (What?)
""I wanna have sex with your vagina""
""Vagina"" (What?) ""Vagina"" (What?)
""E=MC Vagina"" (Come on)

(We holla at 'em like) I swear these little punks be wildin'
Claimin' they only fuck bad bitches, chopper stylin'
I be swimmin' in trash bitches goin' dumpster divin'
I met a bitch on the street, she said she want a nigga that's deep
I'm deep, I said ""I'm the Indian Jones of explorin' crotch
I'm the Shakespeare of enormous cock""
I told her I got an 'oh so flow mean', rope-a-dope? Nope
I got a Poconos swing, little bitch riddle me this (Come on)
""What's the difference between a girl's mouth and a girl's vagina?""
(What?) ""There is none, I want my penis to inside both of those things""
I know you gazin' at the words I text
I ain't a virgin, your wife ain't the first bird I pecked
She ain't per-fect, she per-plexed, she can't quite think
Your baby girl ain't right like birth defects
My religion is God body gynecology
I work with sex, feelin' no pain like Percocets
Sellin' syrup and wet in church and sweat
You herb niggas got me twisted like cursive text
Nigga I cling to her, I'll give her hella smoke
I'll sing to her, I'll tell her hella jokes like
""Why did my penis cross the road?""
(What?) ""To get to the other vagina""

""Vagina"" (What?) ""Vagina"" (What?)
""I wanna have sex with your vagina""
""Vagina"" (What?) ""Vagina"" (What?)
""2 + 2 = Vagina"" (Come on)

""My dick is like an airplane, it gives girls orgasms
I'm the Wayne Gretzky of sexual stuff
I'm the, Hulk Hogan of slammin' muff
Love is for girls and gays (What?)
If you wanna be with me it goes one of two ways
Either you have sex with me, or you have sex with me
Girls love my sex, I'm a good sex man
Cause my sex is the best, I'm like Jean Claude Van Damme
But instead of fight people, I have sex with them""",https://genius.com/Royce-da-59-vagina-lyrics

I hate that your Commander In Chief is more demander and thief

But even a jewel from a fool is still a gem
A dude'll put more energy in killing you than healing him

Martin and Malcolm died for your blackness, pursue your masters

Y'all can play the game one time
Lemme go get change for a dollar real quick
Hey my man, what's up, you got change for a dollar?
What's up, man? You don't remember me, do you?

(Ryan!) I remember you, I remember you definitely
I remember you took my basketball and wouldn't give it back
'Cause I dribbled it inside your store but I was just messing with you
Plus that was my lucky ball
My Dad got it signed by Isaiah Thomas so I kept it with me
Everywhere I went I used to bounce that ball
Everywhere I used to go I used to bounce that, bounce that ball
I'm little Ryan from 16650, Baylis
Remember me? I used to buy all the mystery mix Now and Laters
I used to wait for God to come down and answer all my prayers

Never asked for much when I sat down and say my prayers
All I ever, ever wanted was to be amazing (Ryan!)

Same little boy used to walk to the corner store
Who used to get the Funyun chips
Who ended up, dumb, young and rich
I had young parents but they both were strict
I had a superstitious granddad, wait, scratch that, crazy granddad
I seen him turn his hat around three times
Drive his car around the corner three times in reverse
Just 'cause he crossed paths with a black cat
Man, you remember Hank? He used to be a Jitney at the market
My mom used to do his laundry
He used to have me and my brothers dyin' laughin' at him
Talkin' 'bout, ""You know you can't leave them clothes
In the washing machine too long when they get done washed
And still put 'em in the dryer, doing that makes the clothes stink""
Damn, being back here bring back so many memories
You sure you don't remember me? You remember the ball? (Ryan!)
Everywhere I went I used to bounce that ball
Everywhere I used to go I used to bounce that, bounce that ball
Nigga, everybody know little Ryan from 17150, Northlawn
I used to come and cop pork rinds
I used to watch drug dealers come through in cars
Like, ""If I get one of those, it's showtime""

Never asked for much when I sat down and say my prayers
All I ever, ever wanted was to be amazing (Ryan!)

Is that Ryan? It's always good to see him in the neighborhood
Hey, baby! How your momma?
Look at that car, he done done it
I told y'all he was gonna do somethin' (Ryan!)
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Hell yeah, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Hell yeah, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey (Ryan!)

Wow, this is overwhelmin'
It feels like it was just yesteday I was watchin' ""Good Times""
Wishin' I could get ahold of Thelma
Fighting with my brother over channels
I like watchin' movies
He likes stupid shit like Robin Williams, goin', ""Nanu nanu""
Or whatever that stupid-ass show called
I ain't around here being no attention whore
I need niggas to look at these whips
For every time we got those extension cords
God, I miss my big brother so much, he went to prison so much
That I don't think I'd recognize him these days much
But I'ma always know what to get him from the ice cream truck
He used to get the Push-Up Pops, I used to get the snow cone
I used to wanna be just like Turbo, he used to want to be Ozone
I got all the kids wavin' at me, all the elderly off they high horse
They wouldn't even let a nigga play twenty-one in the driveway
Nowadays, the ball is in my court (Ryan!)
Everywhere I went I used to bounce that ball
Everywhere I used to go I used to bounce that ball
Everybody going, ""Ain't that lil Ryan from over there on Marlowe?
I ain't seen him since he was a baby""
Well I'm back in town to let the people know
That you don't need no lucky ball, you already amazing
And I'm still your neighbor, little ol' Ryan (Ryan!)

And God bless the child no matter
How long it seems, somehow he'll find his way home
It's so important baby
Between the memories and family
I don't know which one is more amazing

Never asked for much when I sat down and say my prayers
All I ever, ever wanted was to be amazing",https://genius.com/Royce-da-59-amazing-lyrics
Startercoat,Layers,2016.0,"(Mr. Porter)
Ryan Daniel Montgomery
5'9""
July 5, 1977
Detroit, Michigan
Porter, you a real nigga, man

It all started with a Starter coat
The starter pistol got us out the momma jokes
The house party finally started, now it's time to go
Get some pussy sponsored by the barber and a bar of soap
I'm stealing cars, it wasn't logical
But on the bright side, they taught us how to drive 'em doe
We used to tilt them bitches with screw drivers
So I'm kinda used to being at the bottom of your columns, ho
But the Billboard list was kinda comical
How the fuck was it designed and chronicled
I can see it now for sho'
Bunch of blasés from a buncha artists with a timeless flow
Gettin' trampled over on a 20 year old blogger flow
If 'Pac ain't on your list then you ain't fuckin' logical
I'm talkin' up the shit, not no fuckin' 5 or 4
What you gon' tell me when I tell you
'Pac introduced me to the fuckin' UNLV Starter coat
It all started with a Starter coat
Wonderin' why Brenda threw that baby in the garbage fo'
On my way to cop my navy blue Starter coat
It all started with a Starter coat
The starter pistol kept niggas out here from startin' smoke
Without it I'd be dead or be an artichoke
The 9 iron armor in the heart of gold (it's that fo')
Nobody witchu nigga that's the Art of War (let's go to war)
But do not forget you fuckin' start it doe (that's my mama)
(Woah, what kinda coat is that?) Starter coat

I grew up with three brothers
As soon as I was born my lungs collapsed
And I had to be hooked up to a ventilator

Now a nigga shining though
Growing up I gave a lotta niggas shiners though
I gave a lot of people my respect
Daddy taught me that one growing up
He threw me through a shower door
I used to wonder why my uncle looking startled fo'
Crawlin' around all on the ground like his heart is broke
I found out he got a crack problem
And he thought he dropped a couple particles
Well I'm a fucking alcoholic so, who am I to judge?
I'm just honorable, I be temporarily in love when I'm inside a ho
I'm a pure artist, I don't need to see the charts
To know the art is under our control
Highs, lows, problems, pain, drama that's what's optimal
I guess I'm just the best at thanking God
And feeling awesome though
Cause I survived the era of the Starter coat
It all started with the Starter coat
I lost my virginity aboard the fucking Boblo boat
I ain't graduate on time, I ain't go to college so
A couple friends of mine did, other friends of mine dead
I'm fuckin reminded, just because I made the most money
That don't mean I went the farthest though
I hope my college friends reminded
You got degrees that don't mean you the smartest though
Mo' money, mo' problems
I lost plenty mo' marbles on my marble floor
Then I left in my Starter coat
What they taught us that was all a joke
You may not got a lotta dollars at least you got a post
I'm arguing with Satan screaming ""I don't barter souls!""
Please don't take my memories of me and my Starter coat

Flesh,Layers,2016.0,"Baby! Baby!
Damn, slow down a little bit
I just wanna get to know you baby
You know what I'm saying?
I don't wanna bite you, it's all chicken except for the bone
Shit, I'm just
Hey, I'm getting a little money out here
I just wanna spread the wealth
You know what I'm saying?
I got, I got money, I got credit cards, I got PayPal cards
What ever you want to do, we could do EBT
You need groceries?
Shit baby, what you looking at?
What the fuck you see over there?
A Unicorn?

Niggas sweat bitches
While bitches sweat the chill nigga in the sweats
If you don't get no respect
It really don't matter, you could be Louis Vuitton'd up
You might as well have on Von Dutch and Tommy Hilfiger with a debt
I don't do dirt, I don't call scenes
I send niggas through to leave a mess

I'm a real nigga in the flesh
I will find a bitch in distress
I will make her feel so alive
Then beat her with the dick to death
Real nigga in the flesh
If shit ain't right between us
We will leave a nigga left
Real nigga in the flesh

I despise rapping niggas
Y'all niggas fly private, I come sky jack you niggas
You disrespect me, I'll get on board with three Ks out
And go to your PJ's pilot
Tell him I need those jet's keys like I'm DJ Khaled
Seems like every artist out there snorting coke and smoking base
I just opened up the briefcase and dumped out the contents
To close up an open case
If my soul shall rise then I'ma lift the hood up like Tray Martin
I'm a clapper, they targets
They trappers, I'm a convict slash escape artist

Real nigga in the flesh
Finding bitches in distress
Make 'em feel so alive
Then beat 'em with the dick to death, yes
Real nigga in the flesh
If shit ain't right between us
We will leave a nigga left
Real nigga in the flesh

I'm p-o-p, you d-u-d
You bark up this tree, I'll make you turn over three new leafs
You live right by the code or get left like three two three
I'm A Tribe Called Quest, I'm the new G
Out here going dumber than Tweedledee
All these youngins wanna redo me, like these movies
'Cause I'm so Pablo Escobar-esque
Elephant in the room, never out my element
Oh, always on my P's and Q's like RSTUV, ah!
Never tell your intel to a gent who's intelligent
'Cause he'll tell a friend who then shall attempt
To turn bullets into shells and spin, and turn humans into skeletons, grrah

I'm a real nigga in the flesh
Finding bitches in distress
Make 'em feel so alive
Then beat 'em with the dick to death, yes
Real nigga in the flesh
If shit ain't right between us
We will leave a nigga left
Real nigga in the flesh, yes

I'm breaking now 'cause I'm dating goddesses
The haters tried but couldn't feed me salt
'Cause I seasoned all them, now I'm raking dollars in
Say goodbye, I'm finna take you outta here
You can't deny it, I'm the H.N.I in here
The four door Porsche or whatever vehicle
A nigga like Lincoln couldn't survive without made it out and over four scores and seven years ago
I know time flies by, yours tick-tick-tick
Mines went-went-went-went like eleven layers ago
My flow so heaven sent
When I go to heaven, I'ma go ""Heaven here you go""
I'ma go tell God, ""I know I promised that I'd never steal your flow,"" I lied
Ain't nothing like side pussy on my dick
Word to the motherfucking DJ Quik
Bunch of girls wanna have a bunch of relations
Even when a nigga wanna be they friend
I learned that faithful women need they men
They don't really wanna leave they men
They just don't wanna get a phone call
From another chick saying where he done been
If your bitch 'bout to leave better ask yourself questions
Like ""fight for her? Why?""
You better step up and fight for her like you're fighting for Hawaii
Or you motherfucking B.J Penn
I'm a real nigga in the flesh
My wife almost left me but she ain't do it
I don't like the way ""ex-wife"" sound, that don't got a ring to it",https://genius.com/Royce-da-59-flesh-lyrics

Said it's the first of the month, got bitches callin' my phone
Just paid a couple of bills, just got some shit cut back on
I gave my momma some money so she can go out and gamble
God only put on me, what he know that I can handle
But it's the first of the month, I'm puttin' some rims on my car
My lady said it's a waste, bullshit I'm a star
Leave me alone
She jealous anytime I'm gon' shine
She said, ""If you so talented why, nobody ain't ever heard of ya?""
She dumps me on the 20th, takes me back by the 30th
She's wrong

Life Is Fair,Book of Ryan,2018.0,"Greg, Ryan, take the damn garbage outside
808 Mafia

Summertime were the funnest times
Momma used to had to say come inside like a hunnid times
Flat booty, big titty bitches just on they grind
My nigga Moody used to say they was built like the number nine
Hah, wish I could be childish for old times
Either y'all were Tranzor Z or y'all were Voltron
Stole bikes with Ike until the time that he stole mine
Told mom, she told me, ""What comes 'round goes 'round""

Stop, right (Right there)
I never said that life, was fair (Fair)

Look, we had our best times when momma and papa went out
And someone like my auntie would watch us
She just smoked weed and want not to be bothered
We go and leave the house to not be by her
She was our favorite, she never would holler
She get high and give out several dollars
Every time she get the camera, she'd tell me to smile
Knowin' damn well I was never no smiler

Stop, right (Right there)
I never said that life, was fair (Fair)

""Hey girl, how you doing?
Yeah, Greg's in there getting dressed, how are the children?
I see you got you a new car
You know I'm just gettin' along, gettin' along
Ryan is doin' well, uh, girl I gotta go Greg is callin' me
It was good talkin' to you baby
I can't stand that bitch, ugh""

I said stop, right (Right there)
I never said that life, was fair (Fair)

Look, same girl that Momma just was talkin' all fake to
Used to borrow our papers, and all of our things
She was always ungrateful, always had bad news
Always into the latest gossip
Always was tryna show our father her nudes, that shit not cool
One day we went out in town and they broke the door down
On our house and stole all of our food
Stole from us, we ain't have much more than you

Stop, uh
Stop right there
You know when karma catch you
Everything in your life goin' fail
You gon' be a failure
You gon' be a failure
Said you gon' be a failure

Nobody Fucking With Us,The Bar Exam 3: The Most Interesting Man,2010.0,"Let's get it started like transmission and alternators
Got the keys in the cage ready for who you call the greatest
Takin' 'em down from the biggest bitches to smallest haters
I'm 'bout to serve these niggas, call 'em waiters
Got my mind right, money right, ready for war
And I got the C4, under my competitor's car
These niggas runnin' 'round talkin' 'bout they better than moi
When I'm done all that's gon' be left bitch is ya head and ya bra
Bitch I'm the head of the pack, and I'm ahead of the game
And I put yo' head on a platter you put some shit on my name
Bitch I'm the shit, see the stains that I done left on the track?
And I ain't sayin' no names but I left the best on they back
And they ain't sayin' no names so I gotta say it myself
I'm finger fuckin' this game so you gotta play with yourself
Don't pull a K off the shelf, or pull a strap out the stash
I ain't gotta draw the pistol, I'll be clap at yo' ass
I just let the hands of God toe-tap on you fast
Leave you mashed like potatoes on the top of the grass
Call the coppers to catch me and they'll just tell you to drop it
I'll find you sooner or later and they can't do shit to stop it
Got that thang and I'mma pop it like a bubble on the double
I am trouble in the flesh, you can't see me with the Hubble
We ain't wishin' these niggas good luck, go get a clover
This Bun B, it's ""B.E. 3,"" this shit is over

SLAUGHTERHOUUUUUSE! (Whoo, Kiiiiiiiid!)

Look at ya man look back at me, yeah I know, sickenin' huh?
If you got a Porsche with only two doors, need to upgrade cause you missin' some
We just got two different bills, different styles, different sums
Started as a drive-by, ended as a hit-and-run
Stop me in the streets, let it be properly when you greet
Fuck lookin' for me, I'm on your property if it's beef
Not for robbery of ya piece, it's lobotomy with my peeps
That comraderie is usually sodomy for the beat
'Less my critics put a lens on them, so I could look through it
Shut the fuck up, probably mean that you too shook to do it
We'd see two pennies to your name, yet you so saucy
When I fix this game you can Thank Me Later for it, no Aubrey
Switch my demeanor up I'm, off my 380 shit
My, future's bright, stars is by my head, Baby shit
Make me sick, what you eat don't make me shit
Found out the reason they hate me is my God-like presence, must be atheist
While all of the frauds in rap is talkin' swag put a fork in that
Slaughter's back, listen nigga I got houses all across the map
Even got a Boston pad, got this bitch from Boston bad
Well put her in a wrestlin' move, but I heard she got that Boston Crab
Batteries in your back, go by what he say
Just need you to know that it's no lee-way, and the tables are turned, go DJ
So you know what that blindfold's for
That bloodshed's a secret, let's keep it behind closed doors

Who you said was dope again?
Ay, it ain't nobody fuckin' with us, nobody fuckin' with us
Who you said was hot again?
Ay ay, it ain't nobody fuckin with us, nobody fuckin' with us
Who you say could spit again?
Ay, it ain't nobody fuckin' with us, nobody fuckin' with us
Who you say was dope again?
Ay ay, it ain't nobody fuckin' with us, nobody fuckin' with us

I'm the present and the future
Like Christmas in 2012 I'm the present in the future, an executive producer
You will never get to choose ya destiny cause you a pessimistic loser
Mess with me and I'll definitely shoot ya
I'mma do's ya like I'm reppin the Yakuza
Die hard like I'm sexing with Medusa, do something nigga
Born thuggin', I don't fuck with the cops
Nuts hang down my pant leg, balls tucked in my socks
I ain't gotta act tough to get a couple of props
Little nigga raised hisself, I don't know what's up with my pops
Do I think I'm the dopest in America? I do
Make you switch your whole style like you're datin' Erykah Badu
Pair of Ferragamo shoes, I will stomp you
I'm fucked up, like the relationship between Farrakhan and Jews
I'm spankin' this instrumental, like a wrinkly old bitch
I'm whippin' the kick and snare, make 'em pick they own switch
I'm smarter than computers that know how to fix they own glitch
I'll leave you face down, like chicks who lick they own tits
And from this day forward, Crooked is aging backwards
Gettin' younger and fresher, puttin' bums under some pressure
Yes sir! Watch the next Slaughterhouse album
Every line is white powder, I ain't talkin' 'bout talcum
I am tighter than ""The Biggest Losers"" cruisin' in a Smart car
Distinguished alkie, the flask on the armoire
I'm from the home of the most popular bomb weed
Most proper, hoes rock with my partners who top seed
Po' vodka, we gon' bottle pop in the calm breeze
No copper can stop a COB star - I'm a giant
Dumpin' my cigar ashes out on top of the palm trees
Chrome chopper, if I squeeze you drop on the concrete
You wanna' talk about the paper? Oh let's do it
Batter pocket syndrome, the money we gon' abuse it
Still gettin' out-of-town paper so don't confuse it
Tell the hip-hop cops nah, it's only music
And haters steady eavesdroppin' on ""The Bar Exam""
Probably in your trunk now dependin' on what car I ram


Flow tight I should probably ghostwrite for your idol
My pen game is God-like, I could write for the Bible
I'm so good, that after I rock it tonight
I'mma go Sexual Chocolate a drop the mic
Don't even attempt to stop me, mention me, top me
My pencil is nice, should only mentally be dropping the dice
I'm a speech beast, you best to not approach me
Matter a fact I think I second that emotion like a re-tweet
My stock goin' up like a Lamborghini door
I feel like Chuck Woolery in the damn Bellini store
You playing yourself you remind me of the lotto'
You was good and then you turned hood, you remind me of Moscato
I don't aim, I'm like Dick Cheney
The 4 spray and light your head up like Lo Pan when he gets angry
This ain't Simon Says, bitch, this what Ryan says
I hit the track and it's a wrap like Aunt Jemima head
I'm beyond out of my mind, if you can imagine
Usin' Magic's johnson without a condom, I'm bonkers
Yeah, got the streets goin' ""dude is tremendous""
If I come for your blood I ain't gonna be usin' syringes
I am raw, there is a difference between I and y'all
You opposed, you throwin' fire balls at an iron wall
The sound of Alan Grunblatt signin' his name on the dotted line
On that paper is your favorite rapper signin' off",https://genius.com/Royce-da-59-nobody-fucking-with-us-lyrics

I guess I'm not hip as you which is cool
I guess I'm not into the shit you're into which is cool
Nigga you's a bitch and your bitch a dude which is cool

I look around and all I see is fools
Some of y'all got street cred, some of y'all got pre-approved
Some of y'all got red carpet rolled out for y'all quick as you
Drop, went right from a Honda to a box 62
They dance and they ballin' and they zonin' like they
 Victor Cruz
Labels only care about hits and views which is cool
Not only am I the alchemist, I'm the evidence
The wicked witch is cool, the cause of her demise
Reminds me of this jet I'm in, a flyin' residence
If you don't write your own rhymes get offended this is to you and you
Listen fool no more bars for you
You can't raise the bar, you ain't in the buildin'
Matter of fact you can't even lift the stools, fool
That liquor disappear from my system like skippin' school
Me and these niggas live by the same don'ts but different do's
To get they name out they willin' to get the lube
That Balmain fit me like my religion true
Call my assistant tell him I'm slippin', I'm spittin' jewels
Somebody come out and get them like them Memphis dudes
We independent, while y'all flash bitches
We in the trenches, ball sack lickin' addiction, y'all need interventions
The gas pedal mashin' the carpet in them SL Benzes
The dash retarded like the special olympics
The needle leanin' past the finish line like Lance Armstrong
I'm exotic smellin' like your baby momma vagina, bonfire island
A Creed Avensis
I'm not a killer I'm just stricken with a sickness called homicidalitis
Flat screens surrounds me and my dubs seat up in my whip
So she can read her twitter mentions in three dimensions
It's no such thing as flossin' if you ain't never seen a dentist
But some of y'all need to take them gold slugs out of your face
Load 'em in the pistol and shoot 'em the fuck into outer space
Maybe I ain't rich as you which is cool
Maybe I ain't weird as you which is cool
Maybe it ain't a style to be lyrical


I don't give a motherfuck, I just get your mother touched
I pick my own date, pay my way, call that double dutch
I grip the ass, I dump the tip, call that shit the double clutch
Wax on, wax off, clean that ugly stubble up
Bonsai, truth is gonna un-lie at sunrise
Your makeup's running, Uber's gonna catch you when it comes by
You boys are entertainment, I understand you like the bitch
But you are pretty famous, sweater like the one Cosby
Wore at his arraignment, uh, I stay patient
Pray gracious, made milli's, while billi' racin'
Now they wanna trade places, as my ceiling raises
My prime lays dormant, they computerized, not I
See, I'm straight torrent, I clock in, write it with my pen, out my acorn
And then I clock out, and leave a black cloud on all eight corners
Started with us to hear the pop loud - 
Robin Harris' House Party
I bet y'all acquit it, like a child killing cop trial
All you see on the ground is an empty rock vials
Like Tommy Lee and Pam Anderson, 
I'm  in the Trump Tower
With this here piece
 manners here, Magnum condom fit, like Juelz Santana
Bandana gear, I used to need antifreeze
She about to need antifrizz, antifrizz
I'm Pac and I'm Nas when I famed danced to anti big
I'm not a star, ho, I'm on Uranus on a pantie binge
Far as are as y'all aside, from flaming all of y'all
I feel like I fathered all of your bars, like I came up in your granny's crib
The most interesting man, on the god damn planet
Beef is having a nigga's bitch, fix me some god damn salmon
Beef is trying a nigga's clothes on, when he ain't home
Beef is your wife, when kids at school, texting me ""They're gone""

Has showed me we don’t fear death, we fear fear itself
Ever since '98 in hip hop my presence been felt
Couple dollars, couple models, couple of bitch niggas under my belt
Thorough nigga, I'mma hold you to it
If we hand shake my plan B is to complete plan A
Grindin been my strategy like this is my anatomy
I should get a tat on me that say why, why, why
Would you let some dollar dictate your army
I brush my shoulders up, polish off
Haters if you play me I’ll spray your potato layed up with fakers
I put them in the news in a major paper
My roller coaster of a career, hope it’s been real for you
Because it’s been weird for me, I feel like

They can take away the cars, they can take away the cash
But I bet you they can’t take the realness that's in me
I’ve been up, I’ve been down, I don’t give a fuck, yeah
I’ve been up, I’ve been down, I don’t give a fuck, yeah
I’ve been up, I’ve been down, I don’t give a fuck
They can take away the cars, they can take away the cash
But I bet you they can’t take the realness that's in me

I just want mama to be happy
Is that too mothafucking much to ask?
Damn it I’m about to cry in this bitch, king of the jungle
I hate liars but I fuck with a lioness bitch
If you don’t straighten your ass out right now
I will find you and iron you bitch
Grindin been my strategy like this is my anatomy
I should get a tat on me that say why, why, why
Would you let losses make you act like a faggot?
I’m a fly and you act like a maggot
Money comes money goes, I used to wear funny clothes
Hammer pants, my mama used to wipe my runny nose
My real family all I care about is her, I’m feelin' like

They can take away the cars, they can take away the cash
But I bet you they can’t take the realness that's in me
I’ve been up, I’ve been down, I don’t give a fuck, yeah
I’ve been up, I’ve been down, I don’t give a fuck, yeah
I’ve been up, I’ve been down, I don’t give a fuck
They can take away the cars, they can take away the cash
But I bet you they can’t take the realness that's in me

Then I watch my daddy hit my mama, listen to my mama
Tryna calm us, y'all don’t understand the problem that we have
Who gives a shit about dollars when you gotta go visit your father in rehab
You said Rick Ryan Marcus as long as I’m getting high your mama will be sad
And only I can fix this so I'mma turn this all around I promise
As we sat he said i’m down in life right now you know I'mma be back
And when he got back home it’s like it was heaven sent
Cause I was only 11 at the time and he's been clean and sober ever since
He gave me this advice, you at a huge advantage
Long as you know what’s rules in life and a view for the planet
Rather you the man than you the mechanic people treat money like oxygen
When they got it they take it for granted but then lose it and panic
So spoken G, I look at him like Superman
And y'all little niggas ain’t even close to me so if he can fall, so can we

They can take away the cars, they can take away the cash
But I bet you they can’t take the realness that's in me
I’ve been up, I’ve been down, I don’t give a fuck, yeah
I’ve been up, I’ve been down, I don’t give a fuck, yeah

Dope!,Layers,2016.0,"Hello
Hey Lincoln
Hey Porsche what's up
Hey baby what's up
Nah nothing much, what's up with you?
Nah nothing, got this broke ass nigga outside
Oh y'all about to go out? Hang?
I ain't going out for long
Probably cause he don't be blowing no good
Naw baby he ain't like you, he don't be blowing no good
Haha well shit I got hotpockets in the oven, what you need?
I wanna see you later
Well my son do got a basketball game later on, but that lil nigga ain't even starting so
You so crazy
Yeah I'm...I can save that gas, I'll be through there

I been waiting in this bitch driveway for an hour my nigga, hell no
There's only one way I can fix this problem my nigga, that's sell dope
I ain't come in this bitch to politic or rub elbows
Even my own bitch know I'm mentally unavailable, I'm busy, I sell dope
I'm focused, I'm focused, I'm focused on three things
That's go and buy three chains, that's fuck your bitch at my earliest convenience and sell dope
When I'm with her she creeping on you, when I hit it I hit it with my phone on speaker phone
While she's moaning I'm still tryna, tryna sell dope
My teacher asked me what I wanna do when I grow up, I told her ""Bitch, sell dope""
She told me go to the principal's office, I went to go sell dope
I don't care about y'all, what y'all wear, where y'all been
All I know is I'm fresh as fuck from head to toe
If you don't like it you can get the fuck out my car
Go over there somewhere and ride Pierre Cardin (You rude)
And when you see that bum make sure you tell him I said that I sell dope
For all the times I was dead broke
Speaking of dead, when I die, I swear I'mma try, I'mma still try to sell dope, sell dope

There's no other life out here I know
So I guess I should...
Sell dope
This is the only life for me
So I...
Sell dope
The nights are long and cold
Long and cold
But out here on these streets you'd swear I had pure gold
Pure gold
In my hands I hold your hope
Nigga cause I...
Sell dope

This bitch told me I can't get them digits my nigga, my nigga, aw hell no
It's only one way I'mma fix this my nigga, that's sell dope
A fan asked me for a picture, I squatted down for a jail pose
Then I dashed before the flash could finish, I forgot I had to go sell dope
What news you got, if it ain't about selling dope, I can't take it
The doctor gave me five months to live, I told her ""Nigga, I can't make it""
Tell whoever set my expiring date I had a prior engagement to sell dope
That's why I'm in every discussion, I could sell a whale a bucket
Of well water, I could sell Harriot Tubman a mothafuckin' railroad
I'm the flower with the thorn rising out the concrete, y'all just born on Melrose
I stay strapped, I stay strapped like velcro
When I meet new people I introduce myself as ""I sell dope""
I just had a job interview, they asked if I ever been to jail before
I said ""Yes"" then I got up and left, like fuck this shit I'mma sell dope
Cause right now I'm dead broke
Speaking of dead, when I die, I swear I'mma try, I'mma still try to sell dope, I'mma try to sell dope

There's no other life out here I know
So I should...
Sell dope
This is the only life I know
The nights are long and cold
Long and cold
But out here on these streets you'd swear I had pure gold
Pure gold
In my hands I hold your hope
Nigga cause I...

Combat,The Bar Exam 4,2017.0,"Then I keep my .40 Glock on me. This has no safety on it, it's fully loaded, there's one in the chamber at all times, so that means if I need to, I just aim and squeeze

Everywhere I go, them niggas know I'm ready for combat
All you ever gonna find in my DNA is combat
Everywhere I go, these niggas know I'm ready for combat
Nothing but violence and rage in my DNA - it's combat

I don't got comrades
I just ride with the gun, cash, and a good girl that's gone bad
I don't have to have a hit, shit could be a bunt
I'm ready for combat
This ain't really what you want
And I ain't really fascinated with your 'Benz price
Fall back and get your car jacked while the engine masturbate the twin pipe
I beat you down
Only time you heard about me backing up is the armoured truck beeping sound
Instead of battle rapping with you, I'd rather speak in rounds
True veteran, sickening flow you couldn't do better than
Show up to your crib, dig a six foot hole, introduce you to your new residence
Y'all what all the flash and all the autographs about
Y'all niggas actin' like broads, it's all your fault that Remy Ma the hardest rapper out
Y'all only do music with people 'cos they hot, so your point is stupid
I just wanna stay the fuck away from you and do a joint or two with Joyner Lucas
Shut the game down
Show you you ain't shit when I come through
Don't even flinch at me - I'm James Brown
You ain't built to fit in that jump suit
I'm super strapped with a rocket launcher - Google that
Lay a hand on me
I'll spray you and your homie
Have you land on him like Scoob and Scrap
I'm in the streets where the movers at
Y'all industry, y'all industries where the Ubers at
I'm ruthless black like Dr Dre crew
Rae Carruth in a topless grey coupe
Got the K cocked, stay true
The roof is back, get in the car
Never been a star, but I'm blessed
I found a girl who love me almost as much as Peter Rosenberg loves Kendrick Lamar
I'm just tryna be the one who finally make Rihanna faithful
Was I the only one heartbroken when I found out French Montana fucked Sanaa Lathan?
And I promise y'all I'm not a hater; I'm just aggravated
I just want all my hoes who don't know that they my hoes yet to act their ages
I just want to drive all my hoes crazy like the one that played That's So Raven
Back to back with me blasting iron, ratchet waving
Caps flying like we had a graduation

Everywhere I go, them niggas know I'm ready for combat
All you ever gonna find in my DNA is combat
Everywhere I go, these niggas know I'm ready for combat

I got real nigga in my DNA
I be killing at will
I'm the illest that live
Fuck a deal, fuck a VMA
I beef, y'all mediate
Y'all PDA, I'm TNA
Soon as one of y'all step by the bar I alleviate
Niggas must want death by tomorrow, if you trying war with me today

Unleash wit' about 30 punches before the first lands and hits you

You gotta rise above that shit

I don't wanna go nowhere with you
I don't wanna drink no fuckin' lean neither, I'm a grown-ass man, dawg

Gun Harmonizing,Street Hop,2009.0,"Somebody lift me up, yeah
And give me a hand
Give me a ride, I'm sliding off the highway
There's a curve in the road
I don't know when I'm going, crazy


Verbalizing my theme murder
Communicating while you debating using machine squirters
Br-r-rat, that trigger's my tongue, I l-l-lick a nigga
That fo'-fifth'll,lift a nigga whole clique up
The Lord call for your soul, it's time to go, pick up
Answer the horn, it's blowing at you, you cold, stiff up
My heat, heating my whole hip up, all we do is court strippers
Your metal freezing like it's a morgue zipper
I, ride around with Preem
Not the Preem from Queens
, 
but the Preem from ""DWYCK""
'Bout to change the game, 
'bout to fly the desert
Eagle for y'all people, like the wing's the clip
And the barrel's the beak,
 my apparel is fleece
I'm adorned in diamonds, I'm a pharaoh deceased
Like if Spawn was rhymin
, 
and I would advise you
Not to tempt her, New Temptations, the gun harmonizing


Every bullet's a note, I write with a firing pen
Every time that trigger pull, it's a quote
Inside a booth fulla smoke, 
sniffin lines of that gunpowder
I'm hotter than a pair of boots and a coat
And a turtleneck, 
the best rapper alive
Could be the best rapper that died, I'm murderous
If you ain't get it by now, I'm suicidal, I'm wild
A nigga better than me, is who I ain't heard of yet
So I ain't murdered yet, he ain't even been born
His momma's a virgin, she ain't even fertile yet
Prepare to get back, next time you take a shit, stand and turn around and look in the toilet, then compare me to THAT!
Don't compare me to none of these muhfuckin' wannabe hustlers
Tough until they standing in front of me duckin'
It's off with yo' head nigga, 'less you one of them Dodgers
We sound off as one, we gun harmonize!


This shit is musical, my spit is beautiful
And if the best rapper died we'd be sitting at Nickel's funeral
But we ain't dying cause our trigger finger nail you
As quick as you clip a cuticle, hollows'll hit your follicles
I split your wig from far away like a long arm barber
Then lift your weight like a strong arm robber
Put that on Moses, I rely on my rod
As sure as Satan's tongue lying to God, everybody dying
It's like you standing in a circular firing squad
Singers for hire, I find him a job
You see the gauge baritone, the revolver's a tenor
Way the shots spin your body, I'ma call 'em ""The Spinners""
Call 'em ""Earth, Wind and Fire"", put you beneath the earth, wind and fire
Feel the fire that burnt Richard Pryor
I'm keeping two guns, I named 'em Romeo and Juliet
Make you take five like you and your homies on the movie set

Hero,The Allegory,2020.0,"(Ooh-ooh)
Uh
Crown Royal bag open, watching boxing
Arguing with dad, who gon' knock who out, shit
He probably gon' be mad if my fighter drop his
And that's exactly what happened, now he got me moppin'
Damn it

Okay, Papa was my hero, without him, I'd be zero
Probably six feet below, probably sniffin' kilos
Probably homicide or robbery for all that we know
Stayed on top of me, made sure that I achieved
Even more than I believed that I can be though

Okay, Lysol, toothbrush, scrubbin' on the toilet bowl
Soon as they cut the street lights off, you rush home, nigga
You must be on time at all times
You gon' get the stool 'cause you won't miss your school bus
Papa was psychotic, Mama was a goddess
Big bro had a dome missin' screws 'cause I grew up a screw-up
Cop the 
Book of Ryan
, nigga, go and listen to us
Even though sometimes a nigga home would get abusive
But Papa showed us tough love, don't misconstrue us
I talked about his past, I thought I did it with respect
But I'm just dragging all these bags, and all these feelings is suppressed
I'm just a artist, and anytime I write, I put the art first
In retrospect, I feel like you're right, we should've talked first
I apologize

To my hero, without him, I'd be zero
Or probably six feet below, or probably sniffin' kilos
Robberies at college, how do we know?
Gettin' into drama's easy, findin' peace is hard as 
Finding Nemo
This goes out to y'all if y'all grew up without a hero

Uh, 17, you told me go to the Army or get out
I had to walk, and as I'm walking out
I started having thoughts of all that's happened over the years
And been swept under the rug and never talked about
Wasn't 'til I let go of the grudge
Let all of these feelings on my heart get out
I got all the blessings the reverend talks about
I agree, a lot of things between he and I should be TMI
Y'all can call me anything but me a liar
I just write the truth for free, my mind for the BMI
Uh, not only did I finally realize there is a God
I realized a nigga highly favored
One thing that's phenomenal was the day I decided
To hold myself accountable for my behavior
My bank account would grow
All of the things that Papa instilled inside me
Was like the common denominator
I flew out to NY, I said, ""I'm living here 'til I get a deal""
Came back a year later signed to a major
Pop, I just want you to keep my mama happy
She stayed right there beside you through all this time
She went above and beyond faithful
And you inspired me to get dollars, but my way, like Carlito
I'll retire you as soon as I'm able

Look what you've done (Nah, nah) (

Never make me six to one, it’ll just make me angry
Never ever make me no underdog
And never talk about who’s gonna stop me!
Ain’t nobody gonna stop me!
Ain’t a heavyweight in the world fast enough to stop me

Yeah, I survived a lot of savage shit
I’ve been vibing like it’s Attica
Bulletproof glass is on my ride, ride around here like the Vatican
I’m an addict, I personify arrogance
I believe you can speak some shit into existence, deleted my 9 to 5 narrative
Now I got a bitch so fine half the time I fuck her, rest the time I just stare at her
Letting the non-believers know I don’t need to go diamond Ryan, it’s forever bruh
I’m a level up from buying stilettos to impress em
Got em blindfolded, tying em up in leather like I’m Edward Scissorhands in some boxing gloves
Hitting it just as if the chick was with the S&M S&M, I ain’t never stressin em y'all are the nervous wrecks
With ya ho fucking me, both hands stroking the pole looking like she tryna roll up a sleeve, I call it the turtleneck
Next, I blow out her back while she sitting vertical on top of dick in a convertible
Call the shit murder the vertebrae then drop her off at the crib with vertigo
I done seen it all, been through it all so you know I know what is what
The smallest part of beef is gon always be all the things you utter bruh
My sense is keen and I got that ivory weighing on the triple beam while I dish a queen
The bitch got the Arsenio Hall from “In Living Color” butt
I got your baby mama hyperactive, piping her while she asking the lord in Michael Blackson accent “Lord, what in the mother fuck?”
My mind is so much more enlightening, who be tryna throw shade? I’m over here just destroying y'all sun
And this is what you call in y’all bag, then I’m in a Goyard trunk
Baby I’m getting cash money, getting the last laugh, the last word too
I’ma need my headstone to say “y'all finished or y'all done?”
Bar Exam 4 y'all, the there is no competition edition
No features, nobody scratching on it, this the I just been itchin’ edition
Ballin’ like I’m in the A-Town with Terio in the bleachers
Y'all are karaoking with Dirty Harry, tearing your stereo into pieces
Y'all need to take a soul searching class
The Slaughterhouse album I’d like to drop it, the New Edition biopic came out and now Joe wanna be Bobby so fucking bad
I’m just joking with my good friend, I’m just so in my happy place
I just know from my head to my toe I’m the greatest, y'all can keep ya ho and ya accolades
Dr. Dre taught me to not oversaturate before he offered me a deal
Right before I got another offer for a dollar amount you know that I had to take
And now that all of that shit is clearly behind us, y'all really expect me to regret being 19 and going and getting a million dollars?
Nigga fuck you, that’s a million dollars, still a million dollars
Nigga that’s 20 million nickels, that equals 20 bitches and an island
Now you’re talking unlimited dimes, and a hundred million pennies
Now do I wanna pitch it down? Hell yeah nigga that’s a million dollars
Now can you get the fuck over it? Please, consider respecting me, I’m willing to fucking pistol bust over it
As a kid I used to just be looking pitiful
A lot of my courses were difficult, so of course the teacher would tell me I ain’t bout to be too much more than just a custodian
And that gave me a complex I’m still stricken with I call the shit the Napoleon
When I walk in the kitchen now I want the ho to kiss the toe and lick the linoleum
All my old bitches before you slit your wrists if you can’t stomach it get some Imodium
Gassin’ bitches and spittin’ petroleum

Haters workin' overtime, 8 or 9 jobs worth
All these wanted ski masks niggas
Old basketball shorts under jean ass niggas
Need to know, I'm a product of a dead poet rhyming at his low
Equals Maya Angelou, my emphatic flow can rise the status quo
Lying on the padded floor, addict at it's best
Eradicated from the fabricated
Afraid of the thought of releasing music that's indicative
Of where I'm at in life, will they like? Will they hate?
The better question is if they hate it, is you down to pay the price?
I'll look you right in your eyes and say, ""You motherfuckin' right""
Don't bother me with adversity
I conquered more ground than King Kong could
All I think about these days is mom good
'Cause she diabetic, my daddy just had a cancer scare
And do he still work at the post office? The answer's yeah
I'm introverted, knowing that it's not about Oz
Bigger problems outside

There's a war going on outside
That no man is safe from
You see you can smile
But that won't change the color of your skin
But I'm the sinner (I'm the sinner)
Yet you kick me, punch me, say don't trust me
Shoot me down like I'm up to something
Fuck with me and say I've deceived you
But how's that legal?
Am I that evil? Why do you hate me?

I'm afraid of you going to college and not acknowledgin'
I'm your father 'cause you not proud enough
But I fought hard to make sure you never see certain things that I'm a product of
It's easy to confuse being a father
With being a provider but all we got is us and I'm afraid to lose you
You the coolest kid I ever saw, she did a good job with you
Sometimes I hesitate to take credit for raisin' you too 'cause all I did was discipline
I never taught you to ride a bike but we still a lot alike
And you makin' music now? I wonder what made you wanna give this a spin
You know what I'm about to say next, right? I'm afraid of you drinkin'
Though I never taught you to swim, I'm afraid of you sinkin'
I know I taught you to fight, you ain't in condition to win this
You wired different
You just ain't the nigga you friends is, it's scientific
Not my opinion so you know you genetically predisposed
To more than just eating soul food, so I'm afraid of you to try to risk it
You in a gene pool with a lot of sick fish
And I'm the sickest of them all, alcoholics die when they stop from the symptoms of withdrawal
Look out the window, tell me what you see
Police shootin' brothers the color of you and me
And they actin' like they hate us so you may just wanna love yourself enough to compensate it
If I can say this, say this one thing, this one thing non-related

You were never, ever, ever, better than me in basketball
Pffft, hahaha! Yeah right, sure",https://genius.com/Royce-da-59-outside-lyrics
I’m Me Freestyle,The Bar Exam 2,2008.0,"Yeah, I got money on my mind, that's why I'm twice on my grind
I'm nice cause I rhyme like it's my life's on that line
The second that I'm provoked, I snap into a point
That ain't controllable, then it's either war, or another quotable
Don't let me get a hold of you dudes, I'll murder you on camera
Get Kelly's lawyer and get a mole removed
I probably shouldn't have said that, fuck y'all
On the record, off the record
If I'm on the record, I'ma off the record
I need a push when I'm tired of rhyming
Go 'head, diss me
'Cause me and George Bush got a lot in common
We both got no sense, we love to go to war
And we stay looking for weapons of mass destruction
This industry is Hilary Clinton literally, listen
You ain't got no choice now, roll with a nigga
If you twisted enough to picture a devil mixed with a angel
That's sick, drunk inside a Range Rov, that's this
Wish I could stick every rapper in this bitch in a building
Let 'em cypher while I fly a plane through that bitch
Cause I hate y'all, I'm tri-polar with the 8 ball
If I want you on my album, I pull out the K and make y'all
In case y'all wanna share my light, I'm gonna tell it like it is
Fuck it, it's my Jeremiah Wright
I'm a motherfucking problem, I don't care if y'all don't like
Times three, nigga, I'm me, nigga

The Evil Genius!
Green Lantern!
I'm me, nigga

Big dick, bitch, big balls
We the kind that supply the rock like Chris Paul
The same kind that aim 9s, insane conscience
And then we get rid of the rock like Dwayne Johnson
Ladykiller, the fly version of Orenthal
You ain't got no DUIs then you probably a cornball
Wittiest, if you call a laptop a labtop
You sound like a scientist, but you probably a idiot
Your stories ain't holding up, y'all niggas lying
Got me thinking y'all either too young or y'all ain't old enough
Niggas saying, ""When Royce gonna stop beefing with rappers?""
Bitch, when hell freeze over and Wayne sober up
By the way, fuck all DJs! I'm just kidding
I just threw that in there to get y'all attention
No intention of ever dying, nigga, life too sweet
Two words for who don't like me, ""fight"" and ""me""
I take care of my family
They say, ""Do the kid rock like Pam Lee?""
The answer is yes! (Yes!)
And I invest, it takes money to make money
So I make green off Green like Stan Lee
Smart shit, I ain't got beef with no Joe Budden
Y'all gon' get one of these niggas killed tryna start shit
Niggas hired muscle 'cause living is a privilege
The only rapper I admire for his strength is Xzibit

It's an invasion!
I'm me, nigga
Green Lantern, drop that shit!

I killed it, right away
Soon as you cross, go 'head, you got the right-a-way
Give a nigga iron like vitamin, play
I will ride up in broad day and night a nigga day (Brrrrat!)
Drunk! I'm a recovering outpatient
You at the top, you shot, your spot is now taken
Psychotic is the ploy, how the fuck you rapping and you gay?
And you've been spotted with a boy like a Dalmatian?
If I switch up, I'd probably be instantly selling
Got a clip full of pellets known as MC repellent
While you talkin' 'bout your money and I can't have none of it
I'll hit a nigga low, just for the Zab fun of it
I will never lose, never lost, I'ma prove it
Except for my virginity, but I was tryna lose it
I be on some Tom Cruise shit
Standing on the couch in the club
Laughing bout my dime new chick (Oh!)
She the shit, but if you ask her she useless
I'm in her pocket
'Cause I got a rocket down under like Houston
So I'm gonna keep being me and you should keep being you
If being you offends me, indeed, it's gonna be me and you
But understand that if it's that, it's either gonna be me or you
So pump your brakes before I do you like a got a key to you
Shut your power off, I'm G-A-N-G
S-T-ARR, yes, we are, bitch, I'm *gunshot*",https://genius.com/Royce-da-59-im-me-freestyle-lyrics

New God flow, no I'll go
Diablo, why, ho?
Why, bitch, do time tick?
Think about it, you die slow
If not you die quick
I’m sicker than Theraflu
Wickeder than a kick over headstone
Sippin' on redrum
After I'm finished just swimmin' inside of the dead pool
After I'm finished just inflictin' on the guy a despicable head wound
Nothin' is important, but to import tons
On my fourth run while I'm eatin' lunch with my forked tongue
I swing this motherfuckin' barrel loose
I don't fuck with knives, nigga, I'm Sardo Numsie
Y'all need to call the police on my people regardless
Rock a bye with my piece then call it Keisha in Harlem
I'm the highest of all beings, my eye is the all-seeing
Dribblin' fireballs with lion paws for my audience

What if the Devil played the banjo?
What if he invited you out on the dance floor?
There's one of six million different ways this can go

Ayo, your fishscale Fisher-Price
First shot killed a nigga, but I hit him twice
My trigger finger itchin' like it was lice
Sent the white in a pot with the ice, whipped it nice
Hurricane whipped the whole slag
Fiend hit the glass, hit his ass, you know the math
I toe tag me a nigga, you know I spaz
I throw a bag to my young nigga, he'll get it over fast
G-wag, 24 karat
Silencer on the Mac 12, you ain't even hear it
Lightning strikin' on the Neil Barrett
Fuck nigga don't get embarrassed
Fuck your two Sarah's out in Paris
Bitch nigga, your life, you better cherish
Ten shooters show up to your show just to air it
Griselda, the dinner place swingin'
Body in the Bentley truck, shit reakin'

What if the Devil played the banjo?
What if he invited you out on the dance floor?
There's one of six million different ways this can go
(So go fast)

Eyes are the windows to the soul, what your secret is?
Once had to battle the reaper, and I ethered him
No tellin' what I'll sing on the mic, he got reefer in 'em
Ghost guts, I can see a ghost, and speak to 'em
Buildin' with the dead like every other night
And I never write a rhyme, I recite my other life
You thinkin' this a verse, but it's more of a testimonial
So flow, up in the zone, only the lonely know
Thinkin' I'm geekin', but I'm reachin' my dead homies, though
Told 5'9 if I have a nine to five
I'll line rappers with the nine and rob em five times
Every day, seven days a week, call it crime time or
Thirty-five licks, nigga, that's a prime rhyme
Fightin' Bruce Lee's demon, but I'm agin' like fine wine
You don't understand me
Cause you don't stand under the code that mean family
Ghost is uncanny

Cyhi know he the best?

Bar Exam, where is the competition?

I like guns more, you the type to knife
I'm more the candy paint type, you more the Mike and Ike
I'm from the 'Mo, I'm more the type to drive the Ghost tonight like I'm the Poltergeist
Embracin' crime like I'm supposed to die
The face of crime, like I'm the closing eye's poster guy
I'm more the type to hold the door, I'm nice
Call me ""so polite"", dawg you Molson Ice
Prototype of pulverizing mics, avoid life's
Rollercoaster ride through polarizing alcoholic lows and highs
I'm more the type to go incite the riot
Throw hollows and watch them go in your body as though they got invited
Not of this Earth trying to be godly of death cause I was Gotti at birth
Might as well write a lot of these verses while I'm inside of a hearse
Take your broad, show her more than just a front door and call that shit Lurch
Prolly gonna be the first artist to add a body to his body of work
My discography just like a map to rapper body bags

We can agree to disagree, we can leave it at that, or we can bet
Even if smack ain't got the fee correct
Any supposedly ill rapper can get it for free
Feared, revered rappers, Lupe Fiasco, tweet or text
Hand on the Desert Eagle squeezing the reapers neck
We can go for broke til things get repossessed
We can flow for keeps, go til either one of us slumped over the speaker dead
You takin a decease in that,  I'm hoping to be the next
Greatest of all time, while these hard lines shake up the web
You facin' an ethernet
And no this ain't no Kendrick Control move
This just a flow that never gets old, Malinda Williams in Soul Food
How could you Violate somebody who got Chris Lighty wisdom, who never bluff
Them twin rifles is coming out looking like Blue Ivy siblings, better trust
Everything on your mind that be on your lap like private dancers trappin
I'll put three in your cap, it's not a good time to try and chance the rapper
Nah, I'm old school, still trying to dance with Patra
Hoes finding Vanity from The Last Dragon tryin' to romance the master
You need to hire a yes man to talk you off your competitve edge
My foot on the ledge tripping on all these woulda been, coulda been, shoulda been 
terrace(?)
Nobody round this bitch is better than me
You the competition? Only props I'll give is you bout good as dead
I don't do memes and bickering, I see you out swing for the fences
I don't like coonin' unless you Mary Blige singing for chicken
Y'all hopeless, every time y'all spit it I just envision lies
The gods focus, I ball doper than Lamar Odom already wishin' a nigga would
Like Charles Oakley, in the Wizard of Oz
My niggas got they rags and sticks in the sky, like they hitchin' a ride
Uh, I'm sitting here counting this grip cuz I be standing for change

Wake Up,The Bar Exam 4,2017.0,"Hello, Hip Hop, what are you doing?
'Cause nowadays you just all seem ruined
Will you wake up? What are you doing?
Using way too much autotune
Hello, Hip Hop, what are you doing?
What's some of that corny shit that you been on?
(Wake up)
(Can you wake up?)
Respect the art
I got one question for y'all
(Can you wake up?)

Competitive rap is back in effect
You niggas out here playing bitchball flapping your neck
What in the fuck is wrong with y'all? Get back to respect
Put on a shirt, get back to the six-pack on the steps
And everybody can't be motherfucking sexy
I just wish niggas would understand that
Man, Instagram just need a dunce button
Now all the rappers got their hands wrapped in a boxing gym
You throw your punches like you ain't ever punch nothing ever
And on the behalf of all men you making us look bad
I'm sure if we took you to the gun range you couldn't spray the target, fam
You couldn't fight your way out a paper bag with Shenaynay from Martin hands
You couldn't beat my daughter in a game of basketball in a garbage can in the streets
If y'all scared, nigga, call the police
I wonder if they know how soft they all look today
Fuck a drive-by, I just hop out the car and mush a face
They all crooks and snakes, all serpents
All part of the large circus mixed with Cirque du Soleil
They all purpose, clique jumpers, they all ball-jerkers
Ex-mall workers who text wrong
Shit like the K without the O in front
Get off the phone, chump
Your career is like a microwave without the door in front
Liked today, but you ain't holding none
Your raps are like just okay, but problem is you're just okay with that
Where the fuck did rap get dislocated at?
I'm just gonna keep spitting 'till this shit's in place
'till I feel 2008 is back
Fans being way too nice, where all my haters at?
I spit hiatus raps, I'm just that good
I never ride the wave 'cause I'm the water, I'm like the rap Suge
Minus the fade by the barber, and all our thoughts cold
And all y'all thoughts blow, ours is Pearl Harbor
And all my thoughts go in line, they can go inside of a barcode
I got the violent history of Gotti's polaroid flow, there's only one way to picture me
Instantly a body
My twin barrells I call Tiara and Tia Mowry
Being shot at is about as likely as seeing y'all on lean and Molly
My mind shuffles thoughts
'Till hard lines touch the bars
And then I spit it like I'm trying to fill up a couple vaults
People find love and realize that love is love
And they should be the fucking law 'cause love is love even when love is lost
You niggas need to be aggressive again
You niggas at them labels need to come from the back of them desks and find the next nigga with talent
And quit being so skewed by views and streams
Or I'll come through and pee in your vegan salad",https://genius.com/Royce-da-59-wake-up-lyrics

Don't even let it be your goal
Just let it come and keep on working
And shine your light on them hoes
Cause I'm the hardest nigga out here
I'd rather die than live a life of fear
I know I got to be down here
To shine my light on them hoes
Hardest nigga out here
I'd rather starve than live a life of fear
I feel like God sent me down here
To shine my light on them hoes

Lost in the world when me and my girlfriend meet, bless you
You know they say ""if you fucked her and she didn't cum
And you came, then she fucked you""
We squeeze first, nigga these ain't rebuttals
These street sweepers, we dump til he jump brooms
Like these nuptials, in the D where dreams come true
This is the the story of a man who's trying to break his doubts
Down like his cases count
Obsessive compulsive counting dough
Making sure all the numbers on the inside
And all the faces out
Lawyers on retainers like they braces out
Say my name wrong, I make you taste your mouth
Money come, money go
Get it but don't splurge it
Your boy's greed and war's needs
Got their own purpose
There's more than four speeds on that Porsche Turbo
It's sitting on four G's like my phone service
I'm out here trapping, but this here's sincere rapping
Dear assassin, you can't kill a signed and sealed classic
Gazelles and Bill Blasses, snake skin troops
Reptile enemies X'd out is what make men true
I'm blacking just like Jamaicans do
I'm running long side your coupe
Tapping guns upon your Wrathe window
Like Ox in Belly, got more Glocks and cellies
Than New Yorks got blocks and delis
Cops and boxes of pirellis, their doors' ajar
Exposing  my Maserati's guts
And that's what got you jelly
The car I'm driving got a pot belly

I'm out here trapping
With this here sincere rapping
I've been shooting straight
Since two inch tape
This is for real classic
And getting money was never part of my goals
It just came along with me shining my light on them hoes
I've been out here trapping
With this here sincere rap
For fifteen years, I ain't leaving here without a classic
I get money, get money money dough
All I came to do is shine my light on them hoes

Hip-hop is my house; watch these philosophies win
Around artists I stand out like I locked my keys in
I forgot my goal at twenty-three was make a classic
Walk away like Tiger with my nine iron then take the master's
They say that you get what you ask for
Well, I asked to be left alone with my pen, pad and passport
This ain't no rags to rich brag shit
In fact, it's more close to being a rich to rags story
The fabric I'm cut from's the most genuine article mankind offers
I'm like an underground landmine talking
For Storch, Hammer & Antoine Walker
And your boy's a tampon
In every store I'm anti-corporate
Highest exalted, call me commercial? I'm highly insulted
This is Royce da 5'9"", mind body and soul shit
All I have on this fucking globe is my shotty and flow
I'd rather let the coroner outline my body in chalk
Than let the fans order me 'round the clock and buy me in bulk

I'm out here trapping
With this here sincere rapping
I've been shooting straight
Since two inch tape
This is for real classic
And getting money was never part of my goals
It just came along with me shining my light on them hoes
I've been out here trapping
With this here sincere rap
For fifteen years, I ain't leaving here without a classic
I get money, get money money dough
All I came to do is shine my light on them hoes

We move in silence, y'all ain't hearing us coming
I was sent by God to provide that imperial sonnage
Ya'll assembly line of rhymers really don't want it
I'll eat you for breakfast, one by one I got ya'll serial numbers
I'm about to send a tweet out to my nigga Styles
Tell him he got the juice now
Call my OG Scarface, talk some boxing with him
Perhaps these new clowns, politic perhaps
About a new him and Royce track
I'm feeling like D to the O to the C
When he got his voice back
Ha, I'm feeling like Cube in a fresh El Camino
Rolling key low g rolling through Detroit's back
Streets waving to all my people
I'm feeling more at home than Reese Taylor
This are what memories are made of
I remember each grudge, each favor
Each lie, each judge, each bailiff
Each job, cheap labor
Each neighbor, each caper
Each Mosque, each Church
Each pastor, pew, and casket
Each future bastard double dutching  through the madness, singing:

Just shine your light on the world
So shine your light on the world
No matter anywhere you go, kid
Shining your light on the world
Don't let the money make you thirsty
Don't even let it be your goal

Ya Talkin’,On the House,2012.0,"Slaughterhouse
Drama
It's ""On the House""
Some niggas talk that real shit
Others exude it
Some niggas get real braggadocious with it
Others just go where they go
Where they go, it go, y'knaw'mean?
You only acknowledge that shit if its dead, nigga
I ain't got enough to say about it
But Royce does

These niggas acting like I reached my prime
They keep yapping, let me speak my mind
While y'all keep talking, I try to stay calm
Thinking how can you let a few negative comments make you perspire by your armpits
When you got your idol right by your arm, shit
And you're only surrounded by monsters
Getting haunted just for celebrating what I've accomplished
And ya chick still
Got my dick in the back of her mind right around by her tonsils
For those who try to rush greatness, today is your bedtime
Before I spew wack hooks and dead lines, I will do fed time
And give me time to rap over your deadline
If it doesn't happen, it doesn't happen
Fuck it, I've been bubbling from thugging and rapping
Capturing, publishing, traveling through the underground quietly under their noses like Tubman and Chaplin
You new school shooters, you're nothing, I'm from the old school like Mullin and Paxson
You bugged out 'til you're bugging assassin
I'm dead accurate, run into me, I'm a lead accident
Pardon my Bergdorf threads if I don’t appear passionate
They hear that last shit and think that I’m here for fashion
Just to take off my glasses and hat, and that shirt
Screaming ""Fuck the whole goddamn Earth""
I'm bear backing it
I'd rather listen to the sound of spitting 13 shells
Than to hear clowns talking first week sales
They don’t know what they’re talking 'bout
Riders inside the slaughterhouse, the liars decided to walk it out
'Long as we're real, we know that the fake won't employ us
We believe in fate, though the fake won’t destroy us
And Muddy Waters, as long as Satan’s tongue is avoided
We don’t give a fuck if Pitchfork don’t support us
They say that Paul and Marshall finally restored order
Why they're rolling over a dollar looking for change
, now I'm here, and I'm providing their four quarters
Courtesy of my boy, Porter
As I’m submerged in this coy sporter
Probably riding around with a bird in boy shorts swerving in a Panamera four door Porsche
Pressing the pedal to the metal to let it breathe
I fuck her and tell her we can never be and she should let it be
Drop her off wherever and drive home to the nagging-est
Bitch ever, tell her she’s the queen and I will never leave
And that's my life, hate it or love it, I'm like
When reality and likeness strikes at the same damn time
Cause I came from above it, meaning this game
If you’re discussing meaningless change
Then fuck you, this discussion just ain’t in the budget
Me and insane completely the same
My brain just retains genius thangs
Even thought my memory sucks, all I remember to do is get fucked
Get sucked and just bang my enemies up
Something like that; I can't remember, dang
I came from pennies to up
From Denny’s to dinner with Puff
Like fuck Denny’s, I’m famous, I’m paying my dues
By paying for shoes and trucks for my cuz, that’s what I do
I'd rather count cash than to do math
All I need to know is if you're losing you're on the negative, and winning's a plus
I’m the general of the tick tick team
Which means your 15 minutes is up, I’m sprinting
And yeah, that dust you’re chasing, that’s mines and you’re in it
And I ain't gotta say who win it
The only time I slow down is when and where
I turn around and said, ""Eat my dust,"" after I finish my cup
You rap new jacks who rap
You can do like Pookie from New Jack
And go to the other side after you finish my dust
Get burnt up by the other side like Pookie
You’ll end up another actor that died because he lied
And now he resides inside of an urn from trying to earn trust
I earn cause I don’t trust nothing but my gun
And my gut, this is how I’m cut
Rich enough to cut one of you little bitty biting ass niggas
Then you’ll be rich from just getting a little bitty bit of my cut
My bitch fly, bruh
I’m hovering over you while I’m fucking over you
I’m holding her thighs up
Tell your homies and friends that I’m fucking the friendly skies up
Don’t think since kid Vish driving while I’m nodding out ignorant
That I ain’t riding around and I’m getting it
Like 2 Chainz, in order for one of you lames to hit me
You gotta find me and bomb me like I’m Saddam Hussein
I can just keep doing it",https://genius.com/Royce-da-59-ya-talkin-lyrics

I know I ain't get back to you
You dissed me a while ago, I just caught it
I couldn't understand what yo' fat-ass was sayin!
It's all good though (I will shit on you)
I'm home, it's time for us to talk to each other
Nigga.. (fuck, you)

Yo yo, I heard you on DJ Butter, you ain't slick
Somewhere in between a st-st-stutter and punch diss
I was like, ""Huh, what the fuck is this?
Why the fuck this lame nigga tryna fuck with this?""
You was talkin real reckless, you dissed the king
Get your eyes off my necklace, kiss the ring
Crawl 'fore you walk, don't get caught without your gat
Somebody shoulda taught you how to talk before you rap
I know about how you gotta get walked though your verse
Niggas tryna teach you how you talk all through your verse
The streets, magazines still knockin your verse
On your verse, niggas just look at they watch and converse
I'm about realism - as far as a fat nigga
That raps and rapes kids, I don't see the vision
You do front, me you admire
You told the truth once like, ""I'm a compulsive liar!""
Insecure niggas take offense to the line
All in my my shit when I'm mentionin mines
Yo it's on, better tell Von stick to the rhymes
You better run and get Swift when I get to the nine
It should be: Wall Street, y'all and Slum V
But no, (nope) you wanna rhyme like Young Zee
Heh, you was a clown in school
Only nigga on stage in a costume, now the world is clownin YOU
The sheriff of the rap - arrestin the big fat bear
That gotta jump into character to rap
Uhh, nigga GIMME this mic, you ain't doin it right
You call yourself a idiot, I'm just provin you right
This is strong over the weak, long career over deceased
And me doin you wrong over your beat
You speak when you see me but you talk the flow
Fuckin clown, smile nigga, honk your nose (honk honk!)
You probably look at it like I'm makin a big deal
But nigga that's what I do, I make big deals
Take a chunk of the budget, and keep they proud raise
And watch the little people split the pie five ways
Nigga go play, matter fact, catch up
I am six figures bigger and my books kept up
Y'all a rap boy band, and you testin me now?
Y'all a group with one star like Destiny's Child
FUCK THAT! No nigga, how can I relate
To a group with four dudes that's easily replaced?
I erase niggas when they talk backwards (what?)
I call Paul and have him write you off on his taxes
I'm a solo artist, you just one of the crew
Fans comin up to y'all like, ""Which one is you?""
You the fat one! Tell 'em that's your name
You will tell a joke whenever too, that's your game
Yeah, who cares if you've been on tour, you don't come off
Nigga all you do is run on stage and run off
Yeah, one loose cannon - that's strange
Cause the only cannon in the crew is planted wherever Proof's standin
I speak to Em and Proof, I'm speakin with love
Them my niggas, y'all sissy niggas keepin a grudge
I don't give a FUCK nigga, you get beat up with gloves
And if you want beef, fuck it, you can meet up with Bugz
I'll shit on you!
You fat motherfucker
Aiyyo cut that shit! Fuck that nigga
You diss me you gon' get dissed back, nigga
Yo' mama, muh'fucker

Separated from they kids, the system's sick
We guilty before we can prove our innocence
Because it's lucrative
The more bodies in cells, the more they can make sales
To get more sales, it makes no sense
And recklin' the major detention center
Won't give their inmates no heat or medical attention
They lie to the masses and downplay their livin' conditions
But steady, they buildin' more prison cells
And increasin' college tuition, closin' down neighborhood schools
They strip away tools, we're still gon' go teachin' them shit they can use
When it's all said and done

Ring, di-ding, ding-ding, dong
The bell is ringin', the clock is tickin'

I had a nightmare the other night
That all of my prayers were denied
When you look toward a savage nation for humanity

Let my people free

Yeah, let my people free
I rap for the night Big L and Big and Pac got killed, uh
I know some street niggas that's real
I know some regular niggas who just as real
Some legends who never popped that steel
Street niggas who rap as ill, real life, they not that ill
Niggas with record deals, real life, they contract kill
Niggas who kill to survive, niggas who kill just to kill
A lot of niggas probably want you to die just 'cause you're dressed to kill (Survive that shit)
Your final day might be the day that you finally made it
Only Gucci we acknowledge around this way is Radric Davis
Only thing fly around this way, hollow tips, I dodge that shit
Gave my nigga three to five for marijuana and legalized that shit

Power (The Bar Exam 4),The Bar Exam 4,2017.0,"That fo'-fo' goes
Anywhere with me I solo stroll
That power
You know when I solo stroll
You know that fo'-fo' goes
That power

Nothing come to sleep as the dreams and regret
Come to a swing of something less than a queen with a catch
Guns and funds and the cleaners hoping my 
cocaina
 will stretch
I'm blood to the Mexican bilingual who go by ""The Gringo""
Who will  out the whole scene if you owe and he come to collect
I'm what you call a triple threat
I'm the one writing a rhyme, I'm the one riding
The one rising, I'm the one writing the check
The one with enough respect to make niggas untie ya
Who's living up under the gun
Who will punch your teeth in the street for bumping yo' gums
When I'm finished all they can say is I even the odds
So many lows, some of my highs were even goodbyes
Got so much dough I don't pull out, I just leave it inside
My hat be leaned to the side like Adebisi from 
Oz
If perhaps there were beef between you and I
You niggas would actually have to sleep in disguise
Fucking with power

Anywhere with me I solo stroll
That power
You know when I solo stroll
You know that fo'-fo' goes

Pardon me for being too cool for this foolish industry
The cruel, demented things that I've seen through imagery
Due to the ghoulish chemistry that the Devil has with the smell of cash
I'm a hustler, I hop in the ocean and sell a whale a splash
I'm so hot I can inhale the hash
I can blow the grass until I'm actually impaling hell with ash
Unhappy people focus on all the shit that's missing
Happy people just focus on what the hell they have
Uh, Max Julien coats and ran beepers
Zangief in my hand just as the man reaches
The transcending of grand legions
I (w)rap till I ran Venus or land in arenas, Saran linguist
White hood on the Phantom looking like it's a Klan meeting
And all that hating'll age a nigga like that Japan region
My fam told me my flow remind 'em of 'Pac or BIG
I told 'em ""I'm just sick, you can't just go to the doc for this""
Why you out here gossipping? Labels tryna sign me
Despite the fact that I'm strapped like I'm in a zombie apocalypse
Uh, nigga, they can score how they wanna score
I don't always be on the charts but I stay on the boards
I don't do beef, I just make you wear the shit out of this two-piece
Whenever I see yo' ass like Paloma Ford
I don't care if they find you at the game and you on the floor
You gon' get this fucking E. Honda, not on your own Accord
Uh, now let's put this all in perspective here
Me, I'm on the legend tier
You, you on the second tier, you definitely scared
You move like you borrowed the first letter from the word ""faggot""
You put effort to put the ""F"" in ""fear""

I'm the splitting image of Dempsey

Everything about you new niggas is Mickey D's

No Radio,The Bar Exam 4,2017.0,"I'm more or less professional
I'm perfection like Rolex
Perpetual but I bet you don't got this necklace though
This cross is so large it look like a set of referee hands calling a technical
Shit --- 
This cross is so foul think I'mma call it Solar
As a token to coming and taken over my self-control
While I’m trying to overtake your estate
While I’m flying on --- karma's involved there’s no escape
My brother never beat a case
He used to hit me from prison asking me to come perform there
I told him I couldn't, that’d be a waste
I'm not trying to berate the guards
I might rhyme and really raise the bars
There’s enough truth in me to set this whole penitentiary free anyway
Now I’m about to spit at you a couple of completely rational things
I’m just a kid with a passion in the back yard flipping on a mattress splashing in the rain
Who happened to make it international
Who made made a few enemies on his way to rap supremacy
After he done captured your brain
Somebody who’s sincerely driven by the spirit of lyricism
Instead of gimmicks designed to get into some kind of capital gain
I ain't never asked for fame
I know niggas who rap who ain't rapping cause they chasing stats
Well they bout that green like Franklin and Jackson
Well I’m bout that green like St. Patrick’s
And only stats I’m on is knowing I'll whoop all their asses
In any and all weight classes
I know fasho in my heart I already coordinate classics
I just need y'all to correlate that wit
Y'all settling for these throwaway corny swore away rappers
Is like putting cat shit between two gourmet crackers, and the actual performers are onstage throwing spoiled eggs at ya
Please, you deserve homemade mac and cheese, and that’s just the start
I'd sell my album for 5 to a guy with only 10 dollars to his name before I will to a rich guy for 10,000
'Cause a guy who’s got less to spend now got to go into his heart just to make his investment into the art
And that reminded me of myself at 19 in Harlem:
I told wifey I would not be back unsigned and came back signed with a million dollars
You looking in the eyes of an MC who clearly sees the climate shifting and the odds against me
There’s no secret
There’s no reason for me to go get more features
I don’t need you to promote or support me
I don’t need your beat
I don’t need to force things
We don’t need to speak more
I don’t need to be out in the street more
I don’t think I need to tweet more
All I really need is these flows
What do we know?
All you really need to know about me is the quality dope
Just because I’m kind of popular what ya tryin to bother me for?
I ain't never came out and bothered none of y'all when ya’ll was partying with the Migos
I ain’t gotta politic bitch - I’m a black star Ali Kweli Mos
I’m a King Tech and Sway alumni nigga, Stretch and Bobbito
Shout to Peter Rosenberg, shout my nigga Ebro
Shout my nigga C tha God, shout to Yee tho
Radio not for me, I see, it’s not about L-Y-R-I-C no more
No more interviews I’m Ceeyo
I ain't interested
Nah, I'd rather kick it with and sit around and listen to that kid Stitches spit while I sniff an entire ki of coke
Nah, I’d rather let Slim Jesus baptize my kids in a synagogue while I’m swinging in my vehicle
Look my pedigree has officially been elevated to best flow-er
That the mean I gotta step down in order to give a mortal direct orders
I speak to the culture like Hova does
Y'all beef and squash beef and then address make up
Y'all speak to the culture like Boy George and Culture Club
But y'all keeping me focused on dodging these vultures
And you know what? I might even be the greatest artist in history
Think about it - all these schemes
These are not just fresh rhymes, sir
These don't get thought of, these get conjured
Then these are compounded in the Exxon and stockpiled until it's time to hop out of my complex mind and possibly create it or repeat it in concert
These are my greater beliefs, too deep for you to rate or critique
As far as the haters, it’s too late you done already made me a monster
PRhyme is something you can thank me and Heron for
Bad Meets Evil is something you can thank me, P and Denaun for

Anything, everything
White people decide between anything and everything
My people divide between anything and everything
(Dang, dang)

Grew up in the hood between anything and everything
White people enslaved us, made us just do everything
Now they just encage us, divide us up and everything
We snitchin' on each other tellin' everything
Buy from other colors, sellin' everything
That vodka was my crush but now I'm just on everything
The landlord just kicked my mother out and everything
But why the fuck my people always rentin' everything? (Tell me why)

'Cause we don't own anything
We don't stand for anything
And so we fall for anything
We wasn't born with anything
We don't control anything
And we don't own anything
And we don't learn anything
So we don't earn anything
We sell our soul for anything
We sell our soul for everything

Mom and papa used to fall out over everything
I'm at the mall, I'm spendin' all I got on everything
Money and the power, bitches over everything
It don't make sense if I ain't livin' for everything

'Cept we don't live for anything
Niggas kill for anything
We dyin' over everything
We killin' over anything
Killin' over anything

Off,Layers,2016.0,"I'm signing off on this
On the same ones the treasury prints
With every intent to see niggas dying off of it
I signed at Sony
A couple of years after the NBA signed Kobe
And he about to retire
So if anybody see Don Lenner
Make sure you tell him I ain't lost it yet
Somebody tell Tom Silverman ""Hi"" for me
Look in the sky there's a fly sorcerer
Eye-balling me from of a flying saucer
And my mind is like a full clip
And my competitions' magazines are running low
Like the Source and Vibe offices
Since '99, Hip-Hop been like my orphanage
Got dropped a lot
But every time I signed I got a million
A&Rs and exec's were telling me I'm not appealing
Trying to turn me into Nas, I'm not him but I forgive you
This is a Bob Marley
Bob Dylan spiritual vibe that I'm feeling
These scars are time healing
Clearly you lost
You tried to put me in a box--how dare you
Try to minimize a lyrical god?
I'll godzilla these walls
My prime's no time near
I'll improvise till my ceilings
Get wizard of Oz
I'm the illest alive
I'm the rose that rose
From the concrete with the thorn
And when I'm gone I shall live in a vase
Me and Porter just handling business
Boy we came a long way from blasting cannons
And having to throw 'em in trash cans
Dismantling shipments
I had the manager shift at my day job too
I laid down rules
No gas station past 8 mile
Past eight or late drive-throughs
Maxell tape, you play the whole B side
You flip it over and hear the whole A side too
Now we got iCloud and FaceTime basically
To knock down the grape vine
Make way as the chaos ensues
Niggas saving ratchets calling themselves bosses
But they not
They David Hasselhoff
And they bay watch
But I'm cool
Nowadays my life be lavish
Who I'm out with tonight
It might be a model or
Might be an actress
She might be a ballerina
She might do plays
She might just like theatrics
She might be famous
I must just pipe her for bragging rights
She might get mad at the paparazzi
For flashing cameras at her ass
As she covers her face with her arm
As if she's dabbing
She might be dragging
Me at some uptight fashion show somewhere
Where people like Madonna and Bono go
I might take one look up and down  at the clothes
And say, ""Hell no, It's time to go.""
Come on it's time to go
I might fuck her on the kitchen table
At her crib in the Hamptons
I might lay her down gently
I might slam her
I might even fuck around and yell domino
My soul just sound off like ""you got a pair.""
I'm a real nigga
I done lost a lot of friends over the years
I've been losing a lot of hair
Been told that I'm out my mind
But if you only knew what was inside it
You too would choose to stay out of there
I take my hats off to the addicts
Going through something tragic in their lives
Shit even I backed off the madness
I had to take some time off the rap and realize
Now how do I stop being underrated?
How do I get props like, let's say, a Drake?
But I rap with the skill set of let's say
A Black Thought or an Elhzi
If Jay Elec can bag a Rothschild without an album then I can come back to rap after doing some jail time
No one cares about sales now
They care about Facebook status
It's all about gadgets and getting fatter than hell
And consuming shit like them Patti LaBelle pies
Like lunatics, speaking of, I knew this chick
Who used to just be happy to make it out the hood to see me
Then she got on some fucking Truman shit
She's starting asking me to do some shit....

Wisdom,The Bar Exam 4,2017.0,"Can't be out here just giving all this wisdom
If niggas don't seem to believe my mission
Can't see myself sitting inside no prison
No need for money I got tunnel vision
All I see is me keep on getting richer
That's when I got that 20/20 vision
If niggas don't seem to believe my mission
Can't be out here giving 'em all my wisdom

Young niggas better stay the fuck from out of my way
Both of us could draw the first shot, it be like the tiebreak
Ask my BMW dealer, we like them high rate
I like straight skeezers who like Dave East, PNB Rock, and Wale
Though this ain't no movie I got Jason V
I got Michael Myers right on my waist
But that won't stop her from doming tonight's Mayor on Elm Street
At my house and my new V right out in my driveway, huh
Remember I'm the best big vocabulary in the stretch six
I don't stress, I'm rich, I'm Ashy Larry in the flesh, bitch
You haters busters, you Dave & Buster's, I'm David Justice
Translation: I'm making Halle Berry my next pitch
I ain't one of them you just could mess with, the Devil naked
Up under that blue dress, that's like my death wish
Rape her, contract an infection, if you scary
Take you back to the essence, obituaries are actual confessions
Today's lesson: we live in a great rap depression
To make a record takes more than just to stay black and reckless
Do you have anything to say that's impressive?
Do I listen to you at dinner and playback at breakfast?
Hmm, do you know what a classic is?
Do you know the name of the place where your pastor is?
Don't you know the rap game is based on sacrilege?
Man, I'm being petty
Don't you know that war's an ancient acronym that stands for ""We Ain't Ready""?
And while I'm combing the town I could travel blocks
First place that it all went down was Fraggle Rock, now it's the gavel drop
Before I had them hammer handles I had them handles
Coulda been in the NBA 'stead of rapping had I had them hops
9-8, I got stung by a dragonfly, draggin' a mop
So nowadays, I stay sharp as daggers while I'm stabbing the drop
I keep a Mini Cooper that always follows behind me
I call it Tavis Smiley, that's 'cause it's black and small
I hate your cigarettes, I hate the smell of Black and Milds
You hate me that's crazy I hate to tell you we at the top
I ain't heard a decent bar in months, bruh
I'm tired of hearing 'bout your stinking cars and all your dumb trucks
How you be with stars and how your gun bust
I'm here to rain on all you deer, young bucks, high and drunk fucks
Won't feel a thing we gon' make this shit quick and painless
Lifestyle of the rich and gainless
Right now you stayin' in the same place every day with a different payment
Existing in rented space
If niggas ain't gonna innovate then the game gon' renovate
Okay, you got it, great go for a K
Them thangs on the interstate
That's cool, but I choose to not leave the booth till I see pain on the interface
When we pass, our possessions ain't gon' reach the masses
So fuck yo' Audemar, your Patek Philippe, and your glasses
Bitch

Can't be out here just giving all this wisdom

Slaughterhouse, still standing
There was a murder last night
And the shit didn't really sit right with me
So I had to tell a story, ohh, baby!
Blood on the walls, street life

America's worst nightmare, ahead by light years
Hip hop's only shining star in the night's air
Right here, don't fight fair, what I write, yeah
Might there, throw 'em off like they Bobby Knight's chair
I been where you tryna be, I'm already hot
All about cake, Betty Crock' and spit ready rock
They know my bar came venom in a bezzie rock
Kicks from Fight Club, outfit from Eddie Brock
I'm going for the kill, focused on a steady plot
John Wilkes the Booth like when he dead aimed his nezzie shot
You listening to hip hop's finest
You rewind this, Slaughterhouse behind this

I like rap, this shit is cool, I'm better than mad niggas
But I'm just as good a crack pitcher as a pad ripper
I say that to say this, don't let mad liquor
Turn me to a bodybag zipper and not a ad-libber
Couple joints ago I was right on that ave with ya
Mad bigger than the catch David Tyree had last winter
I'm not a made-up character, that's a Puerto Rican Brooklynite
With two kids y'all see in them mag pictures
And however I gotta feed 'em I will
All they ever gon' need in life is just, me and my will
Interfere with that it's gon' be more than a beat that I kill
Disrespect with an indirect and you will see if I'm real

Fuck you blood-sucking parasites
I'm bringing the terror right in front of your parents' sight
You parents' eyes and yeah, I wear a pair of pipes
I wear 'em like cellulite on a pair of thighs
I'm Eric Wright, I'm Ruthless, I terrorize
You'll either perish or be paralyzed, I'm a thousand degrees Fahrenheit
I'm even keeping them heaters when we perform
On stage rocking like we from Korn, the people roar
What they don't know it's a secret war
Inside of a rider I'm seeking revenge on the world for bein born!
And the desert eagle is mi amor, she'll fuck you to death
Blow your brains, either or cause she a whore

Allow me to reassure your stripe's worthless
Like a pair of Diadora's when it leaves the Adidas store
Don't be comparing us to rappers
Compare us to the Arabs, this a terrorist attack, uh, boom!
Lord have mercy, we here to destroy everything
You niggas is butter in front a fucking machete swing
Mothafucka I'm fly, I ain't no scary goon
Try me and I guarantee you I'mma see you very soon
Leave a nigga ass out like Prince, take his bitch
Put my Graffiti Bridge right Under Her Cherry Moon
We notorious, pushing them Porsches
Y'all niggas the orphans – us? We the warriors

Ohh, wait a minute boppers
Royce, slow it down baby

This rap shit is a workout on my legs
A nigga going hard on his bike but too many dudes is jumping on the pegs
They know when that raw shit get recorded
Either let your speakers enforce it or lay down in a moshpit
Of course it's the bosses, acting like officers
Running in these corporate offices
Hungry looking for a four-course dish no matter what the cost is
Like the world's lawless so we don't know what remorse is
Cause the V need like a thousand horses
Slaughterhouse hoodie on, that's my new couture shit
It's Jumpoff! He be the best
Computers rank me number one, blame the BCS, it's they fault

Ask about your boy, I'm nice with my hands
Maybe that's why, every last thing I write is a jam
Minus the fans, the flights to Japan, I am the man
Anyone who feel they could see me is in dire need of a eye exam
My mind expands wider than the fanbase of a fire band
And what I release from my diaphragm, sticks to you
Like the wrists of Spiderman, fool a average listeners
What you liars can do but you will die a scam
When I die they will retire my entire hand
For years of scripted whoop-ass, making intruders try a can
I guess the moral of the story is Joell's victorious
And everything's all gravy like Notorious

I left a nigga dead cause he said he was ready for I
Let the Beretta give him wings since he said he was fly
I'm in my Chevy riding to ""Bar Exam"" and ""Mood Muzik""
They the closest to ""Reasonable Doubt"" and ""Ready to Die""
Crooked I, watch for snitches and wire devices
My 45th, fire in crisis, lift you higher than prices
All my ice, and on the mic, I am the nicest
Me and my bitch ride for life like Osirus and Isis
Yeah, word to Run-D.M.C. I'm Tougher Than Leather-face
Never threw a gun in the trash but they call me Weapon Waist
It's like you moving from the projects to the Hamptons
The way my hammers be sending bastards to a better place

Let me set it straight, they fans been led astray
Niggas keep gassing with guns with unleaded spray
They don't know they one flow, one medic away
From being taken away from here in the leaded state
I handle all of my serious issues with metal
I stick you so deep in the earth your zipper can tickle the devil
I'm skipping the pick and the shovel, I'm picking you up
And I'm shoving your head in the mud 'til your kickings is level
Pardon I live for the moment, you rhymin I give the atonement
Like the Indians, I scalp and I wig the opponent
But I'm a chief, matter fact I'm a beast

Conceived immaculately was me, my mom's gift
Unwrapped right there in a room like Christmas

Run whole laps around y'all with my thoughts
You ain't hold back on yours, nah that's my fault
Now picture me falling
All the way to the bottom and I'm laying there calling
""Somebody come help me,"" find my strength
To stop drinking this poison, 'fore I drown my gift
And yeah it's prolly unhealthy, 'cause I went so hard
And woke up sober, I lost my good friend & broke up soldiers

Two words she slurred and they sounded like this
""One year,"" traveled through the room
Like moonlight, through the darkness
Ooh, it's heartless, how could I beat two felonies
Then turn around and lose, and lose like this?
My lawyer’s saying stay calm, people saying, ""Pray for him""
They locking my black ass up like Akon
My wife at the crib going crazy
Pregnant, yelling, ""I ain’t having no more babies!""
People saying Preem ain’t fucking with me no more
Niggas in the pen looking homo, no, no!

The king of my city, swinging my dick as I’m walking
Up to the 750, I open the door
My cuz and like several bitches make up the décor
I look in he got a cup and he pours
I tell him, ""Nah, I’m good,"" I would’ve chugged it before
I’m a new man but I could fuck with a whore
Nigga, my dick so hard it’s prolly touching the floor
Riding 'round in the back of a black luxury toy
Getting sucked, like niggas cannot fuck with me, boy
When I look in the mirror, all I see is the real
Your nigga shouldn’t be here, R.I.P. if you will
I’m the moment of truth, I’m the only significant thing
Roaming the scene, soon as I go in the booth
I'ma do it this time, I'm feeling really defined
Unsigned to signed, nigga the city is mine

I gotta shake this, shake this, na-na-na
I gotta shake this jail shit off me
""He ain't gonna never sell, he gonna fail"" shit off me
I gotta shake this weak shit off me and keep shit off me
And leave it in the streets like, ""Bitch, get off me!""
I gotta shake this jail shit off me
""He ain't gonna never sell, he gonna fail"" shit off me
I gotta shake this weak shit off me and keep shit off me
And leave it in the streets like, ""Bitch, get off me!""

Bitch, get off me!
Get off me!
Bitch get off me!
Now do that make me a liar?
Get off me!
Get off me!
Get off me!",https://genius.com/Royce-da-59-shake-this-lyrics

Taxi Driver,The Bar Exam 3: The Most Interesting Man,2010.0,"I'm the taxi driver
Ridin around with me and my thoughts
In the back seat behind me speakin
To me while I'm drivin, I'm hearin 'em talk
To me sayin' where they wanna go
Soon as they get in and they close the door
And then I cruise to wherever we ridin'
Wherever you can imagine from coast to coast

I got a foot on the gas, I got my eye on the road
With an open mind as I roll, hopin to spy on my soul
I lose control, pull up to a liquor store then get blowed
Ridin down skid row, feelin kind of miserable
I been the same since my enemies came
You play the game, you get a foul, the penalty's pain
Though I got a pen full of poison, the venom is fame
The light changes, I take a right on Memory Lane
And see, a couple niggas on the corner chillin
Lookin more and more familiar closer to 'em I get
I pull up, hit the locks, they open the door
And hop in and say they names is Hip and Hop
So I grin, pretend I don't know 'em for shit
I ask ""Ay, homie, why they call you Hip?""
He says ""I'm hip-notic, hip-ocritical
I could say Dear Mama and wonder why they call you bitch
I seen drama, I step to the odds lookin at death in the eyes
They probably murder me, check my disguise
You see it's money over bitches, bitches bring lies
Money bring trouble and trouble wanna follow me
Drop me on the corner of Flamingo and Koval
And remember all eyes on you
Then I come to a stop, he exits the car
So I leave and I hear shots

I'm the taxi driver
Ridin around with me and my thoughts
In the back seat behind me speakin
To me while I'm drivin, I'm hearin 'em talk
To me sayin' where they wanna go
Soon as they get in and they close the door
And then I cruise to wherever we ridin'
Wherever you can imagine from coast to coast

I'm the taxi driver, ridin with one passenger left
About to catch a left after I catch my breath
Peelin' past them times where niggas blast them nines
Paranoid, done already lost half my mind
I'm high thinkin' like what if the feds try to out me?
I pull up to a stop on a red light at South Street
I catch a parade goin by, full of rappers and snappers
A Cadillac float full of trapsters
Carryin a sign sayin ""It's Our Time""
I wave sayin I would never diss y'all grind
So I'm waitin at the stoplight, South Street is jumpin
I look back at Hop like, people call you Hop, right? (Yes!)
After that, he's like ""It's a green light
You can weave right through, if you got keen sight
To make you a right then, head for the valley
I'm Going Going to Cali Cali, uhh
Trust me, Mo Money Mo Problems
Especially when you built for the stars
You rather be, drivin your taxi than killed for the car
So drop me on the corner of Wilshire Boulevard""
I take him to the place he requested
I tell him thanks for the message, the cab shakes when he exits
I pull off Hypnotized then hear shots
And then my engine die soon as they kill Hop

What's on your mind? Who's in your back seat?
Do you go off your own thoughts? Are you even drivin your own car?
I know what you thinkin, ""This nigga sayin Hip Hop is dead""
Don't take song like I'm sayin we lost Hip Hop, take it like I lost my mind

I'm the taxi driver
Ridin around with me and my thoughts
In the back seat behind me speakin
To me while I'm drivin, I'm hearin 'em talk
To me sayin' where they wanna go
Soon as they get in and they close the door
And then I cruise to wherever we ridin'

It’s Over (Freestyle),The Bar Exam 3: The Most Interesting Man,2010.0,"They say I'm the best in here
Picture your wife fuckin your twin, I'm like him
May the best man win, so later for you bums
A ways back I made a pact
To stay sharp enough to sharpen a razor on my tongue
I'm sick with this, you sick like a panty sniffer
And you just wanna see her pee, like a dick blister
Y'all remind me of Fantasia brother, y'all be wilding
On TV every day, I turn on y'all and y'all be cryin
I'm surgical with this motherfuckin pen
The sickest nigga spittin 'til the end

I don't really have to go against actors
I'm the last lyrical WTF-OMG factor
So back off 'fore I blow your kneecap off
I'ma eat this beat like a beet-eating vegan
Industry's where the beef is
In the car goin beep-beep while I roll over the drums
And just straight peel through the pieces
'Bout to build me a time machine and
Get in it and go back, I'm done
Find Frank Nitti and Al Capone like
""Can y'all autograph my gun?""
Haha, I ain't tryin that hard right now, I'm just havin fun
Tell the whole world I just had a son
First name Earth, last name None
You live on that and your cash ain't come
And you don't spit that shit, ass ain't gone
Raised by a gangsta, come in the house with your ass whipped
And you get an ass-whooping
What a nigga know about the water in the shower getting cold
'Cause the bathroom faucet is on
The reason why I grabbed you, stabbed you, out-rap you
When I ain't feeling like talking with chrome
Heat a nigga house with the oven, like I like thugging
What I probably just spit, on my mother
Had to heat up the house with the oven
Had to spend the night with my cousin
Yes, I be popping lots of shit, you can't do nothin 'bout it, bitch
So get the heads up or be my Rock'em-Sock'em opposite
I'm like a stock or bond, that could drop a bomb
Riding slow with the slidin door on the side
Open on that minivan, intended for no soccer mom
Lighters up high (High), I'm your fire supply
Writer with mad skills, I'm ill, so hire your guy
Nobody's harder, he don't give a fuck what he slaughters
He will drag your slutty daughter through the muddy waters
This beat is bait, get it out of me, I can shit it out me—it's ate
I think I owe Drake an apology

Still Waiting,The Bar Exam 4,2017.0,"I'm still waiting on you
Yes, I'm
I'm still waiting on you
Yes, I'm
I'm still waiting on you
Yes, I'm
I'm still waiting on you, you, you
Taking it back just like that

I'm still waiting on you niggas to inspire me
Lately, I've been feeling like retiring, you B.S.'ing
I take a pull from the Romeo y Julieta
Like if niggas ain't leveling, hiring, UPS is
I'm challenging y'all niggas to move the needle
If not, fuck it, I made enough, it's cool with me though
The quickest way to have your pimping in doubt
Is to let the hibachi chef throw a shrimp in yo' mouth
That's a flag like it's crips in the house, fag like a dick in the spout
Past life itchin' just to come out
All of y'all just be telling them lies
Most exciting thing y'all can do is jump out the closet yelling ""Surprise!""
I'm a product of Funkadelic and Parliament
I blow the roof off and make all you chicks suck my doggy dick
I give you niggas a Mardi Gras full of martyrs to party with
It's apparent, I slaughter you and your guardian
So tell your muscle I make a doctor open him up
And button him looking like a skeleton wearing a Cardigan
Now, who the fuck want it? Now of you who got the back of
Who the fuck want it, bro? I got the scolio
Y'all niggas be wanting too much dough, slow your roll
I don't know how much I'll loan ya, I'm not OVO
Woah, for those who try to live the rough life
Pistol through your clothes, slugs ripping through your cashmere
Give a nigga a buck 50 like I'm the cashier
Leave us left for the beef, resting in peace, you tough, right?
I'll punch a nigga to Timbuktu
I got a drum, I'll front a nigga ten bucks too
The outcome of playing big bank to little bank with me
Will prolly be a hundred thousand in ten bucks too
Uh, y'all lonely savage on the mollies acting like your life is violent
I'm catapulting bodies, catching 'em like a virus
Try to violate me, my ETA is a major scene
And it will be the day, it will be the GTA ""wasted"" screen

I'm still waiting on you
Yes, I'm
I'm still waiting on you
Yes, I'm
I'm still waiting on you
Yes, I'm
I'm still waiting on you, you, you
Taking it back just like that

I could tell by your dress code you extra hoe
I guess the rap game's 'bout who flex the most
All these funny niggas with cloudy jewelry at these award shows
Was never rich, but dropping gems to poor souls
Tap a super model, she bound to need Morse code
Screaming with my head in her box, it ain't a Vogue pose
God's favorite, a public enemy, love my women in all flavors
If I made it, we all made it
'Pac reincarnated, spitting on cam, fuck 'em
But I'm just me, I never claim to be the toughest
Ain't gotta tell fake dope stories for you to love 'em
Blood rushing like when a Russian, is hugging a Kalashnikov
Busting, cousin used to tease me, call me crack baby
Tell 'em nothing changed, still dope, baby
Lately, I ain't for the monkey shit
Shooters with banana clips, dumping 'em
Catching 'em slipping and peel 'em up at the family function and
Tell me who I'm up against, I run this shit
Nigga, the only thing could kill a legend is a double dish
Ride on 'em, me and Nickel Nine on-a ya
You know I snuck the thing in this bitch just like a foreigner
Pay no mind, it's no biggy, but shit I'm warning ya
The way I ball gon' make a nigga cornier
Tell the coroners ""come"", baby, there's been a murder
Never was underrated, nigga, I'm unheard of
You outta line like you ain't got a lotta drive
Fuck around and clash with some niggas you idolized
Bottom line, I'm a man with a lot of pride
Got my mama's eyes
From the ghetto, I'm traumatized, where I lie confined
As I watch my demons ménage screaming ""I'm alive""
Life is a freak, I put faith is this lady marmalade
I just sign on the dotted line
It's for rappers who look like they get sodomized, you outta time

Just like that, that, that, that
That

I'm poisonous pesticide, extra wide nostrils
Hostile infects aside, it's the chainsaw massacre
Texas side in a Lexus fried doing donuts
As if I grabbed the coffee with it for breakfast
This shit I write it make you ball up your fist to fight and
Take off on a nigga, make him think he missed a flight
So you shouldn't ignore me then, I can trade lines with Scorpion
Or pretend I'm not Kevorkian, just his dorky twin
And I ain't got a lock when I'm sticking the door key in
Cause I got this in the bag like apartment 4B when
Jigga was a hustler who later wrote about it on the intro
To In My Lifetime, and you's a customer
Not accustomed to how I'm on the cusp of greatness
And at the top of the food chain, I could hump the waitress and
How you do these dishes? I'm truly vicious
I know you wish my life sucked and Death blew me kisses
But I'm extra closer to the Testarossa
The best, supposed to make you sick to your stomach till you possess an ulcer
You know my reputation, who in yo' camp wanna step to Jason?
A sick disease that cut into you like six degrees of separation
You'll find it's more lines in this rhyme than a brick of ki's
That any crime unit would be quick to seize
From some high rollers who are thick as thieves
Who love the top dog and how he flick his fleas
And I could give you food for thought before fricassee's
Or I can just rub you out like two crickets' knees
They rather see me chatching murder charges
'stead of Jamaica at the SPA on my third massage
Living the life that's in need of a narration
Give me the spotlight, you can keep the interrogation
At the sheriff station
And I swear if you tryna play the don
Think before you dive in murky waters with a megalodon",https://genius.com/Royce-da-59-still-waiting-lyrics
Life,Rock City,2002.0,"Come here, Royce
[Chorus: Amerie & 
Royce Da 5'9""

Life is a moment in space (
come over here
)
When the dream is gone (
sit down, let me talk to you
)
It's a lonelier place (
right here, over here
)
Uh, this is life
Life is a moment in space (
sit on daddy's lap
)
When the dream is gone (
I want to tell you something
)
It's a lonelier place

Listen, yo
Little Royce Nickel Nine, eyes wide with sight
With a future as bright as the light in the eyes of Christ
Ready to take on the world and whatever is in it
Proofread, sign, and seal whatever you finish
I can only lead you while you're on your quest for knowledge
I'ma teach you to have sense and to respect the dollar
Hope for the best, and you'll see, your world will be solid
I'ma teach you the truth, even behind worldly logic
This is life, cut and dry, days is bright, nights is dark
Fights get sparked, it's almost like to get ahead
You got to be twice as smart, the realities of life is harsh
Just know that God's keeping you level
He'll even speak through the ghetto to reach you
Just to teach you that the streets is the devil
Everybody's design is different
Which means that we're dying by livin'
Oblivious to the time that we're given
So you don't prepare for the death, you live for the life
And live right like, do right by your kids and your wife
Have fun as a child, yo them years is precious
The future brings fear and stress as the year progresses
You gon turn a lot of them down, you gon feel rejection
You gon tell a lot of lies and you gon hear confessions
It's a two way street when you deal in his presence
Only your life can show that everything is real in this message
This is life

Life is a moment in space
When the dream is gone
It's a lonelier place
Uh, this is life
Life is a moment in space
When the dream is gone
It's a lonelier place

Yo, the whole world is upon you, the pressure is on
And you can probably sum your life up the best when you gone
Upon the creation of all men, destiny's born
For us to reproduce, so you can keep the legacy goin'
I know you think I'm Superman, but I got weaknesses too
I keep a firm leash on things by believing in you
And after I'm gone I live on breathing through you
And anything I had in this life, I leave it to you
Aim for the sky and fly till you come back down
I hand you the baton and you run, till you come back 'round
Let your heart tell your temper, ""Put that gun back down!""
Dry your tears up and turn that frown upside down
It'd be plenty to cry for, think life, not death
You got much more to live for than to die for
But you got to stay humble
'Cause just as hard as your work to get it
There's people working harder to take it from you
'Cause life, something that people take for granted
As time passes, you gon' want something back
But you won't get it 'cause history's made every second
So you crave every lesson and save every blessin'
No matter how you view the world, yo, you never will get it
The world'll be the world through the eyes of whoever is in it
But things ain't gon' always go right
Look at it like, yo, this ain't your day, but this your life, and live
Life

Life is a moment in space
When the dream is gone
It's a lonelier place
Uh, this is life
Life is a moment in space
When the dream is gone
It's a lonelier place
[Outro: Amerie & 
Royce da 5'9""

Yo
There will be trials and tribulations
But don't let them, don't let them, don't let them bring you down
I said you better keep going to your destination
After your darkest hour the sun will come around, oh-oh-oh-ohhh
Yeah
Oh no, no, don't look away-y-y-y-y-y
Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no
This is life
Ayy, ayy, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Yo I don't care, I don't care if this song don't sell one copy
That's not even what it's for

Part of Me,Street Hop,2009.0,"You took a part of me with you

Last night we had a one night stand
But when I woke up in the morning I missed you
You see, all I'm saying is ""Can I see you again?""
'Cause when you left you took a part of me with you

It's like it's an urban legend, his mistake
Her confession, how 'bout it for a first impression
How 'bout it, with the Birkin looking perfectly measured
Looking certain as ever like she got her purpose together, whatever
Him? He was like a typical thug
Hat and glasses, he had to bag the baddest bitch at the club
He had a way with his words, a certain – how should I put it?
""Je ne sais quoi"" is how the French bitches would mention him
Never known for loving 'em all, having 'em driving his cars
Having 'em in the mall on his budget balling
Him tryna call her is the part of the issue
He said that when she left she took a part of him with her
He ain't a stranger to the one night stand
If you loving 'em, you's a sucker, that's the one night saying
But why give him the wrong number and fuck him later on girls
That's all I'm saying, let me tell you how they met
He approached her with the usual swagger
""How you doing? Blahzay-blee-blah-blah-blah"" - the usual blabber
Now that the ice is broken it's time to get linked
He asked her if he could buy her a drink, she nodded to him and said
""I don't really drink but thank you for the offer
Let me buy you one and we can finish talking
How 'bout some Patron, and have him fill the cup up
And when you finish up we can get into something""
He like it's easy as pie, you see it in his eyes
He tryna turn her out tonight and leave her where she lies
Tell his friend he hung her out to dry
Another bitch taps him on the shoulder and he turns around surprised
She said, ""How you doing? I think I know you from somewhere
Yes, I do, don't you drive that Mercedes out there
You was driving by me one day I was walking
You pulled over to me and we started talking""
While they talking shorty one grabbed something out her Birkin
Tossed it in his drink and watched it sink to the surface
Shorty number two kept talking like she was tryna stall him
Long enough for that thing to dissolve in
One gives the signal, two says ""Who's this?""
He's like, ""Sorry, I'm rude"" then introduces
One to two – they start hitting it off
Just like he wants 'em to, it's wonderful
He thinking, she's a skeezer, she's just easy
They both probably bi, so this should lead to a threesome
They both probably high 'cause neither one of 'em drinking
They both keep giggling so you know what he thinking
He swallows his Patron shot, sets the cup on top
The bar like we gon' fucking party, don't stop
One cues two then, says, ""Where your ride at?""
He says, ""Hey, I let valet decide that""
They laugh, they leave, he says, ""Mami, drive that
I'm tired or I'm high, I just wanna lie back""
They get to the hotel, they get on the elevator
He ain't feeling so well like ""Fuck it, I'll get better later""
They get in the room and start taking off they clothes
Dude stepping out his shoes while he checking out the hoes
He's sick so he sits, one says ""Lay down""
Two says, ""I'll take off his clothes, okay now?""
He loses consciousness, he dreams of number two riding him
Sliding up and down with no condom
Number one sucking on his dick using both hands
Both hoes dressed like nurses, I guess they role playing
He comes to as the room circles and comes to a stop
He's not certain or not is he still dreaming
He feels numb so he looks down and sees
That he's laying in a tub, full of ice from his knees
To his waist, in a bathroom with grief on his face
He feeling like he too weak to move so he waits
He feels around and notices a piece of paper sticking to the tub
From his bitches and it's written in his blood (What the fuck is this?)
He panics, he screams, ""Oh God, what's happening?""
More reading, less praying, no time for rationing
The letter reads, ""Never ask for shit
'Cause you can get more than you ask for, we have your dick""
The letter reads, ""Never ask for shit
'Cause you can get more than you ask for, we have your dick""

Last night we had a one night stand
But when I woke up in the morning I missed you
You see, all I'm saying is ""Can I see you again?""

When you dressed in your sweater vest and you best leather
I pull buttons and press levers, I'm backwards
As a dyslexic letter,
 jet setter, et cetera
Catch you boy on planet COB
Go fuck yourself give your hand a job!
Like Nickel 9's brother, the kid's Vishis
I own half a beauty salon
So you know I'm with splitting the wig business.
 (Whoo!)

I got a big dick, bitch! (What?)
That ain't no punchline, I just a got big dick, bitch!
'Bout big business, Slaughterhouse!
You and your clique gettin' with this
Y'all at the movies wearing blindfolds, get it?
That means you ain't seeing the big picture
I find irony in being the headed rapper decapitating
I'll get Rihanna on a track and won't even rap on it
Just let her moan to the song while I'm masturbating
You the best rapper? Homie congratulations!
I'd rather be known for felonious ratchet waving
You deep, we deeper, but we married to these streets but
We don't jump brooms, we just carry streetsweepers
Hell yeah! Detroit baby? I'm felt there
Leave a brain elsewhere, it's the name on the card
To my health care, I'm hard, you facades, piss me off
I put your thoughts on your broad
You fucking screamer, later with your tough demeanor
Ya fruit, I V8 juice your fucking team up!
Give me 50 feet! (come on!)
Why you acting all brand new? 50's teeth
Got the bullets looping, I pull it, the clip repeats, without the DJ
I got more gunshots in the Glock - than Whoo Kid got in that instant replay
Ooh, you thought that was a diss to Fif'?
Then you stupider than Muslims looking for gifts on Christmas
Clip-out, 'bout to stick my dick in the hole in the handle
How you gon' walk a mile in my shoes?
I'm walking on water in Moses and Hova sandals
Giving boxers, the opposite of going commando!
That's right, I put a bunch of boxers on your ass, boy
I'm fly, Boeing is my handle
I'm from the metropolitan rock bottom, if I spot 'em, I got 'em
She wanted to swallow when I shot it, but that's not my problem
She's your wife she just my concubine and
She like to holla Ryan while I'm behind it like she my momma mind it
Willing to get more physical than the lacrosse team
Blunt so big look like we just rolled up the Swamp Thing
I'm high feeling like I should be higher
I ride like Michael Myers, wire ride like a bike with no tires!
No case to fight with no priors

I look at my phone like wow
I think about all the Patron I downed
Maybe that's your business, no judgement here

I came back from tour, she done got skinny with acne
She got her hair dyed blond and it's up in a bun
Her ass is flat and it's gone
I asked what the fuck was happening
She reached up and tried to slap me
(No, ahhh!)
I slipped and she missed it
And then ran in the bathroom and slammed the door
I was like, hell you alright?
All I heard through the screaming
Was something about me following chicks on Snapchat
And her having pics of me and her in the sack last
And she 'bout to go sell it to a site
She even told me she already sent an email to my wife
Damn, my lil misses blackmailing me and shit
I guess she fell for the hype

My lil misses on my mind, misses on my mind
You completely switched into another bitch
So now I got a psycho mistress on my line

For some reason i believed the bitch
Best thing I could do is
Tell my wife before my wifey see the shit
Maybe I can loosen her up
By taking her on a vacation or skiing trip
Maybe I can lean in for a kiss and plead the fifth
Damn, shit was all good just a week ago
Until we hit a fever  pitch
Now I gotta go on my phone and delete the bitch
Then I get a text saying ""I'm pregnant and I'm keeping it
I'mma get my child support
And I plan on paying my lease with it
You ain't never gotta worry about hearing from me again""

Aye what up this is Royce I'm away from my phone for at least two weeks, I'm on a family trip with my wife and kids. Please leave a message
You didn't tell me about no family trip. Fuck that bitch, fuck your family, Ryan I need you to call me

Live from the dungeon, we coming
Y'all best be running, we coming
Y'all don't want none of this gun and
I don't know why y'all keep frontin'

I'mma scare the socks off you for sure the shock stops all you
Knock ya lox off and chop your watch off you
Lurking in the back like a crook in the black of the bushes
With the rats, with a axe, and the stacks of wood is
By the garage, the Mirage tracks the shadow
My weapon is large with bodies, I'm strapped for battle
My soul is in the crossroads, it hides the feeling
Somewhere deep inside the spirit to rise the killer
I'm too distant to talk
, my vicious assault
Is inflicted in parts to slit you and stick in your heart
I got nothing to lose and nothing to gain
Only way I'm dying is up in flames, I'm stuck in the game
Look at you busting ya thang
Shots only get stuck in my frame, I got you not trusting ya aim
I never speak but you can hear me breathe at night
With a hunger and greed for life 'til this eve was right
I'm a true killer, a troop risen to do business
Live on a booth on a river drooped with news clippings
I only come out when it's time to run out and find
An innocent victim inside one house with blinds
I'm Freddie Kruger, Jason and Scream chasing a dream
Looking for a scene to take to the extreme for the mean
You better carry your Uzi's is rare to do me
Everybody's scared to view me, I'm Scary Movies

All this room in this big house you chose the attic
You running slower and slower so you froze in panic
I'm wearing a white mask, black cloak and dagger
You scatter hoping for life, grabbing ropes and ladders
Under this robe, I'm tatted up, automatic'd up
I'm mad as fuck, I'mma kill no matter what
You - live in the wrong house, at the wrong time
You've answered the wrong call, so you all mine's
You can't put fear in the heart of the heartless
Got a list of names just don't know which one to start with
At your house, staking it out, posing as carpenters
Looking for closets and house guns with cartridges
I'm low down and stressed, I go around the rest
Of the house looking for Granny to throw down the steps
And when it's your turn - oh you know it's tragic
And the music in the background is so dramatic
I'm tryna lift you off your feet - hope you know gymnastics
Try to - soak the mattress with rope molasses
You try to - cover your head like a prophylactic
Next time somebody calling your phone, don't answer it

Layers (The Bar Exam 4),The Bar Exam 4,2017.0,"Sometimes I be wanting to say ""fuck the world""
I don't give a fuck
Shoot it out with all you bitches
Bitches don't love me
Young black nigga, nigga fighting a war nigga
Everywhere you go bitches throwing rocks nigga
Man a nigga in a Lamborghini

When I pick up a mic I feel like Lorenzo and Ice
Eazy-E, Dre, and Yella guess I'll be a nigga for life
2Pac's soul hovers right over my board while I record
Patron enters my blood then it comes right out my pores
Some of these rappers spazz, some of them choose to serenade
Some of them need their swag
Some gon' breathe their last air today
Some believe that hip-hop police is working with these
Various media outlets even pay Vlad to interrogate
I remember back when I was blacking out without beats
Hoping for better days to focus how I'm gon' meditate
Seem like everywhere I go, somebody approaches me going
""Cole is platinum without features!"" Well, so is Kevin Gates
Acting like you can't be a fan of both, your standards low
My flow luxurious like chinchilla mats on the Phantom floor
I vow to kill the style that you love and write it to keep me poise
Come at me fly, turn your album cover to the Beastie Boys

I was telling my brother how you rappers are the new leaders. You're the real leaders of the people. The rapper doesn't think he's a leader, but he's got followers all over the world. The biggest preachers don't have as many followers as one rapper

I represent war, pain, destroyed fame, contort cane
Chess playing rather than board games
Savages saddling up, grabbing the horse range
Dragging emcees traveling eating like Bourdain
The congregation asking me how I be preaching so accurately
I answer it's actually easy, I'm ordained
The name is Luther Campbell, you can call me Luke though
Standing for what I'm saying like Farrakhan on Donahue's show
Now they trying to find a loop hole
The silence my words, the knowledge I speak
Is a reflection of the violence I see
Now the perception's your daughters and nephews idolize me
Now the objective is call me highly aggressive instead of just successful
Cause my rhetoric highly suggestive
Probably connecting cause it's honest, refreshing
Only way I'm trying express it
Down to die tonight
Grabbing his gun and shit like a young Malcolm
That'll get me capital punishment like the Pun album

So is the question now how can we get you to rap where intelligence is coming through the lyrics with a beat that begins to open the minds of people. Our people want better. And they'll do better if they're shown better",https://genius.com/Royce-da-59-layers-the-bar-exam-4-lyrics
Horseshoe,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Let's get this lyrical murdering under way
Put these niggas way under, no delay andale
Make these niggas lay under
Dirt, the undertaker's taking over
No wonder they getting ate by the eighth wonder
What you saying sorry like apologies
My poisonous bars got toxicologists
Analyzing my anthologies
Can't harm me, why pop at me
It's like﻿ I got hereditary sensory autonomic neuropathy
Why box with me, harder to hit than a lottery
Why bother me, kill cats like curiosity
We enter the place and niggas shake like they naked strippers
They hate these niggas because we make figures like a pottery
Y'all upset me like a nun who's bad
I'm deadly with my one-two jab
I can punch through, gun proof glass
Kill shit when I wreck, Conrad Murry
I'm responsible for this mics death

Allow me to put this in perspective, check it
That was Bar Exam One
, allow me to quote from the second
Nigga there gotta know, nobody as hot as me
Got a dragon's heart, boy I'm so Sean Connery
The four-five pop'll give your whole squad lobotomy
My snub nose in the air and the chrome shotty gotta be conceited
Bring life to rhymes I'm creating
Bust hard on a track before it stop ovulating
You say you sick come see me, the rhyme doctor's waiting
My occupation is to off my patients
It's not augmentations when I put something in your chest
And yep, tools fucking you up like a botched operation
I let them slugs go free, my Glocks not enslaving
My bullets nigga, pull the trigga from my tool and thin ya
Niggas hear my Glocks proclamation, bullet emancipation
Every hot shot's a statement

Shoe-gang
, 
they loot for they loot
Quick gunners you ain't got a shot when they shoot
To the grave I'm a walk around with the trey deuce
Die with my arms out like I'm trying to be Jesus
I'm gigantic and quite manic and accurate when ever I blam it
That's the reason these niggas panic
Get it right, I'm disgusting around mics
Like Yahtzee this game is nothing without Dice
No matter how many thoughts I leak on cheap(?) tapes
I can never fully drain my massive think tank
Play me the best, I bet I'll eat what he can't
Even he'll have to mark my pictures my speech paint
We mobsters, rocking rocks and goat
Nine tick toking, watches, cocking rides and fighting(?)
Popping optics, squashing squash with problem
Y'all can't stop these cobsters, that's preposterous

I'm a spot light villain
Diamond heist I'm shine stealing
I must be Christ-like cause your wife she like kneeling
If looks could kill I got you in my sniper sight
I'm ice thrilling like my ice grills in
Erase you like ancient Mayans
Escape from an insane asylum
I'll make any atheist and satanist praise a tyrant
I'm scraping the sky be height a giant that's named Goliath
When I stomp the continent brakes creating islands
In honor of Obama's inauguration I'm enslaving Republicans
I stuff em in concentration
Camps I'm Osama and I'm a racist
I hate the human race so I'm wasting the population
I'm an ape and I'm crazy as dominatrix and Dahmer raping his momma to spawn an abomination
Wait, give me the﻿ safe's combination
I'm Tyra Banks brother Bobby
I rob banks with the face of Ronald Reagan

Y'all bitches should call Nickel the Don Bishop
The poet, a mixture of Don Go and some 
John Grisham
The flow will have you rewinding four-five times
That landmine rhyme written with porcupine lines
Step up here with the horseshoe
COB gang we them folks who will
Bend your gun barrel to a horseshoe
Only fuck with monsters, we the true monsters
I pop up on you like you said Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice
I can't even see the both
I can fit in Stevie's shoe
I'm sick, I've got that Desert Eagle flu
I'm rich, little nigga we don't need the set, Teflon
The doctor tried to take blood the needle bent, ask mom
Fifty percent of you niggas is punk bitches
I fuck with real niggas
Real niggas that want weight but don't want fitness
Vision a horseshoe is all I could see, shit
Me and Crooked I done let the dogs off their leashes

Just let it ride
Just let that shit set in
Let it resonate in your brain, fruit",https://genius.com/Royce-da-59-horseshoe-lyrics

Police cars with they sirens come by when I'm rhyming
Saying they got a call that somebody 'round here done fired shots
MAC-11's in order, the flow is like water
Each quote's a quarter of blow, the chorus is followed by the dot
Goons, goblins and creatures and monsters'll bounce ya
And beat ya and stomp ya and eat ya
Don't get swallowed by the block

""Lay here and speak to me"" just to say how psychotic I am not
I'm too fly with the viral and physical copies
Niggas sloppy, look up what you under, I'm what you tryna top
I'm scared and compared to no man
I'm like the big hand on Big Ben
I get in and I'm hitting my numbers 'round the clock
I'm 'bout to give it back to my nigga Bus-a-Bus
And have a seat, it's convenient I'm already copping a squat

Nowadays when niggas walk around
They start to look like hamburgers and frankfurters
Ayo, Royce Da 5'9"", feed on these mothafuckas, homie, come on

Take him, gut him and take out his organs and smorgasbord him
The more important he is I'm toe-tagging his beat
Turn him to chicken chowder, dip him in some sniffing powder
Season him with gasoline and throw his ass in the grease
Mention my name in a record, I'ma come get you lyrically
Individually, I'ma take it back to the streets
Cannibalistic mentality, rappers hating
Decapitate him, rap 'bout what I naturally happen to be
Flow is superb and you heard us forget it, two verses
Two murders acquitted, personally it's a wrap, capiche?
Fingers snapping and tapping they feet
Clapping what happened the street
'Bout to happily bring it back to the D
Niggas claiming harder that all of this time
Niggas believe him until I see him and then slap him and see
I ain't having it, havoc is average to me
War's normal, only thing I'm having is having a feast

Royce Da 5'9"", you my dog and I'm your dog
Being that I already sicced you on these mothafuckas
It's your turn to sic me on they ass, let's go

Every time that I marry the rhyme and the beat
I go hairy and grind in the street, then I'm fucking up everybody
Pulverizing shit like we gorillas and peeling your skin
Like we banana peelers, it's hazardous if you copy
Don't you know that I'm one of the coldest, courageous
The boldest contagious, ain't no one can phase this thing that I do
Well, you know since I report the latest
That niggas can't fuck with me
'Cause I'm the greatest, my shit is sick like the flu
You see I'm animalistic, the cataclysmic events
That'll happen whenever I grab the mic and talk
Indeed I'm back and specifically
That I'm hickory-dickory-dock of this rizzy
The diddy bop in my walk
Now I'm the messenger to set the temperature, nigga
Whenever the heat will be needed to hot the block up, I'm saying
I got the Dillinger, Harry Kissinger with the ratchet
The fact is, I'm back with the clack and the click, see I ain't playing

Why, oh why, oh why? Royce Da 5'9"", please tell me why
Why the fuck these niggas gon' let us get together and do this shit to 'em?

If I could just be honest, my wifey fuckin' gorgeous
And if I ain't fuckin' Rihanna, then what the fuck I'm cheatin' for?
If this movie I'm living's for your viewin' pleasure
Then I can't really be no whore
Cause they don't make 'em like me no more

They don't make 'em like me no more
Yeah, that's opportunity knockin'
I'm standin' where it might be your door
To say to you that they don't make 'em like me no more

May God bless anyone against this conquest
Y'all hire muscle like I'm pressed
Like I ain't out here walkin' 'round like I'm a one-man arm press
I'm just in the zone
I said, ""Less talk"", not ""Let's talk"", let's just get it on
Who the best out right now? Just get 'em on the phone
Tell him I don't want much
I just want to tell him that I plan to come and kill him
I'm a probably talk to him soft like Liam Neeson
Like I'm bein' decent
I'm PRhyme, I'm Slaughterhouse, I'm BME
I'm sort of like 'Pac in the vest, I got no fear in me
Cause I done been to hell and back so many times
That I think I'd seen the smile on the face of the reaper
So don't waste your time prayin' to your creator
Too late, he can't make ya like me, bruh

Nah, they don't make 'em like this no more
That's opportunity knockin'
I'm standin' there like this your door
To say to them that they don't make 'em like this no more

This ain't the standard ops you niggas done ran across
I'll send my little man across the street
He'll stop squeezin' 'til somethin' pops into your head
Like a random thought,
 I don't care for drama
I'd rather terrorize you, chase you 'round your city
Like you Sarah Connor and I'm the Terminator
I'm wearin' Ferragamo the same time that the devil's wearin' Prada
Why would you and I compare albums?
I got your life in the palm of my hands
Layin' it down is all I'm thinkin' 'bout
And newsflash, niggas is frauds, it's all an act
When he tough wit' the talk
He don't go out in traffic, he know I'll slap him
He know I'll snatch him out of that box he lives in he calls Abby
You know I'll stuff him back in that box
That I put niggas in called casket
It ain't nothin' to squash, don't call my line wit' that wack shit
You want to get to the bottom of that? Call catfish
Now let me get back to what I was doin'
This hundred-round drum turns around time in mixed months
Same Valentine's day massacre, March Madness
Wrapped in a big blunt, let's smoke the niggas who really live it
Who know what beef really is and don't speak if it really isn't
Got niggas doin' life in the prison on the iPhone and the corrlinks
And I live in the no-fly zone
And more digits is all that I got my eyes on
I see you clowns through the eyes of the Lord
I'm lookin' down knowin' I'll be around for your rise and your fall
You rhyme, what's more mind-blowin' than a 9 to your jaw?
Even a weak flow could be nice
I'm takin' penitentiary chances
We roll the dice like the Migos in Vice
You want these hoes and likes
Me? I'm the one there'll be no one like",https://genius.com/Royce-da-59-tdmtlta-lyrics

Inside a little white bunny, you can call me Energizer
The most interesting man in the world, I know papi
Sippin' root beer floats Saki mixed with 
Dos Equis
I'm a Slaughterhouse rock star, 
I pick up the biggest pig

Dissin' me can be pretty fatal 'cause bitch, I got Money In The Bank from puttin' that shit into Yayo like 50's label
Fuckin' freak, ya mommy and daddy, daddy and daughter

The next MC that rhyme 'official' with 'ref with a whistle'
That ain't Young Money, I'mma definitely diss you

His charm is so contagious
Vaccines have been created for it
Years ago, he built a city out of blocks
Today, over six-hundred-thousand people live and work there
He is the only man to ever ace a Rorschach test
Every time he goes for a swim, dolphins appear
Alien abductors have asked him to probe them! 
If he were to give you directions, you'd never get lost!
And you'd arrive at least 5 minutes early
His legend precedes him the way lightning precedes thunder

I'm in the twilight zone
I'll murder every MC on your list
You can count on me to do it
Until I'm there and I'm the only one
I'm in the twilight zone to some
I'm in the twilight zone

And I'm your host for this evening, Rod Serling
I was supposed to defeat these odds early
I hope you don't think that my focus shifted with my sober shit
I'm still the coldest with the flow, I still be holding loaded clips
I just be wearing clothes that fit, financially I'm comfortable
But to the young and broke I appear old and rich
My advice is hang around me, then you might be learning some
Only problem is you niggas clowns and when I'm 'round you I stick out like Sherman Klump
Hitchhike and wearing Pee Wee Herman thumb
I'm just a bird who gets the worm and when it comes to flipping words
I'm sicker with the terms than a determined Trump
I'm here for earning till the sermon's done
Get out my ear with shit that's not my biz, chump
You will get off 'cause we don't offer tea
You will get turned to Kermit lunch
And you ain't worth the money my attorney wants

We ride on our enemy, but naw, I ain't shot you
I just looked you in your eyes, with the nine in your mouth
Cause niggas been murdered over hip hop, B.I.G., 'Pac
You a artist them niggas died for you so now you ain't got too
Uh, for yo' ho shit, these boys bled
They opened doors for you to hide behind decoys, feds
Hip hop, they got they own police behind these stories, yeah
You might be killed because you wearing blue and he wore red
I'd prolly be dead if I never elevated my skill
I invaded they projects in the elevator with steel
Cause they just imitations, shit, this how the truth sound
When them credits roll, your label gon' tell me you got the juice now

Until I'm there and I'm the only one

Your wifey sleeping on me? Cool, I seen that she needs a beauty rest
I give my man that look, that's it, he gon' see to it that you be dead
You give your man that look, that's it, y'all newlywed

Give Up Your Guns,The Album,2008,"When I woke up this morning
I found myself alone
I turned to touch her hair
And she was gone, she was gone
And there beside my pillow
Were her tears from the night before
She said give up your guns and face the law
I robbed a bank in Tampa
And I thought I had it made
But the hounds picked up my trail within the glades
So I ran
And I stumbled on this cabin
And she came to me to me once more
She said give up your guns
She said give up your guns
She said give up your guns
And face the law

This is a stick up, stick up
Pistols will lift up, lift up
If you don't get up, get up
Your hands
Kwe tell 'em

Succumb to the violence
And we get numb and get silent
Get my gun into firing
I'm never runnin' or hidin'


About a hundred any minute bullets runnin' from the guns
In front of any one of y'all youngins
We ain't trippin in the winter
Still killin' spring chickens
We ain't slippin, we ain't sittin'
You ain't listen this is me
Bitch this Is Nickel bitch
I'm G
With my nigga Kweli
Get back gettin' stacks since 03'
No strings yo swing wack
Spittin' crack makin' tracks
Like a dope fiend oh
Me and my team hot
Dream team I done seen
Obscene fiends seein'
Nigga whole backdrop
Like a green screen stuck before its cream
So they stuck him up in Sing Sing
I know what you mean dog
I been caught between walls
I don't kill (I'm the boss)
I just make Scream calls
I don't aim I don't give a speech in the streets
Like I'm livin' in the movie
I just let the thing off
Hittin' up my funds while I'm rippin up the slums
With the only pistol left
Cause they givin up they
Guns
Chorus:
And now I'm in this cabin where my own true love should be
Instead there lies a note she wrote to me
And it said: though you can't live by the bullet
But you sure as dead can die
My love give up your guns or say goodbye
Goodbye
And the sheriff now is calling with a shotgun at my door
Son
Give up your guns
And face the law


Hell naw my niggas don't make speeches
Cause we ain't no fake preachers
Or follow fake teachers
Soon as the state releases
You from the bank
You not a citizen
You quickly learn the difference
Between rights and privileges
Nothin' like Deliverence
Remember when Sai got shot?
Yo it was winter he layed on the ice shiverin'
Comfortably numb
He was killed for being hungry and young
Violently is how the company run
They dump in the slum
See the flashing lights and the gun
At the end of the tunnel no rebuttal to run
The blood is the sum of the equation
When you add up the factors
The splatters attractive
Life don't matter to rappers
So we glorify and glamorize
Talk about our plans to die
And learn to always stay inside the motherfuckin' camera's eye
Get my good side, murder is so sexy
But the hood cried every time one of us would die

Give up my guns never you crazy?
I'm all blazey
All 80 fly out
Put you right out lets try it out
Save the babies
Bressed to impress
Blow a hole in your vest
With suitcase money I roll up the stretch
High powered 9's Mausbergs
Squeeze faster than new V's
Fresh new bags of bullets or bean
Got my paper poppin' and plottin'
I blow a hole right through your stocking
Come out your back and scratch up your lockin'
We real killas and don dons
Pop through the vagabond tons
Boulevards where niggas will pull a card
Wrong songs don't play me lady killas
Baby guerrillas with hate feelings
That'll spray up the ceilings
The best ninjas in the business
Mind your business
Staten judicious
Malicious team we live in the kitchens
And dis niggas go the fuck home
Bring better biscuits
Come to the rally and flash if you with this

I'm not playin'. We shoot niggas. All day. Keep them hollows nigga. They got
New little guns. New little joints with long baby missiles in it. Them the
Joints we play with nigga. The Einsteins is on nigga. Hard bottoms in
The hoodie. Ice Water nigga. Word up. General Shala Raekwon. All day
E'day. A professional. Yeah. Get that money niggas. Don't never give up

Down These Roads,The Bar Exam 4,2017.0,"Green Lantern
Everybody wanna be a beast
Until it's time to do what beasts do

They can put the trashman on the stand when I'm fighting the charges
I don't care, I'll still put your life in the garbage
And I'ma still be righteous regardless
That door that you opening up to friends and fans is likely revolving
They don't always like to see you evolving
Let's go

Come on down these roads
Where shit can get real thick real quick
I chose this path so I suppose I have to deal with it
And no, this isn't an encore
It's more like a presentation by a boy fly as a Concorde with reservations levitatin'
Demonstratin' longevity, as he's never left the sky because he's never been let down by his own revelation
I left Patrón alone with strong meditation but I'm convinced it's in my chromosome 'cause my heart's forever racing
I zone every day but I'm never dated
Even rechrome on every Saturday tints
I'm a culmination of all the reverend hates and the omen, but never Satan
I'm knowin' heaven's waitin'
If you come on down these roads
Down these roads where there's not a free soul
Quick highs, complete lows
Everything in here is expensive, even cheap clothes
He's hot, he's cold
Here we go

'Round and 'round we go
First they love you
Go
Then they hate you
Go
Then they love you again, and it's
'Round and 'round we go
Then they hate you
Go
Then they love you
Go
Then they hate you again

Come on down these roads
Where people get real slick real quick
Makin' millions ain't even the guarantee
But you will eat so in a sense, this is your meal ticket
Niggas will sit and eat with ya
Leechers and ass and feet-kissers
Trash bitches and sit and wait for you to finish that cheap liquor so she can sleep with ya
But naw, this ain't back in the day
These bitches these days like to take sneak pictures without asking you straight
Shit, she might even end up leakin' 'em to the internet
Five minutes before your bride-to-be can pass the bouquet
For that infamous five minutes of fame
It's crucial timin' but you decided to
Come on down these roads
But you done signed it
The contract is in black and white
And you might as well try to just make a movie out it
You livin' inside the house fans built
They might decide to move you out and

'Round and 'round we go
First they love you
Go
Then they hate you
Go
Then they love you again, and it's
'Round and 'round we go
Then they hate you
Go
Then they love you
Go
Then they hate you again

Come on down these roads
Where shit can get real lit
Niggas can fly quick as they wheels lift
Over that SoundScan, that Nielsen
Over that crowd chant, they will sin
Over that ball life, life flashes right before our eyes
Like that check engine, that aura light
You might go fuck a whore and roar, you know I'm right
Your wifey tryna claw and fight for ya
Blowin' up your phone at 4 at night
She might go fuck your boss in spite
That's if you not the loyal type
That's if you got the kind of boys who mad 'cause you don't throw 'em cash
Each time they owe and ask you to go and stashes
If the answer's no, then you so irrational
You the one who ruined 'em, you shouldn't have spoiled his ass then
But you don't wanna hear that one
Come on down these roads
Where by the time that you've developed a buzz
You realize that Coke ain't even a helluva drug
Rick James lied to you 'cause everybody and their mom do it
You might've even been high and seen God do it

'Round and 'round we go
First they love you
Go
Then they hate you
Go
Then they love you again, and it's
'Round and 'round we go
Then they hate you
Go
Then they love you
Go
Then they hate you again",https://genius.com/Royce-da-59-down-these-roads-lyrics
No Coming Back From That,UnKnown,2009.0,":
Nigga I will rap a circle 'round, a circle 'round you
I navigate with wizardry throughout the Earth around you
Shout-out to Drake, no bitch could be the ""Best I Ever Had""
My candy cane dick and mint balls
But she ain't suckin' if her breath is bad!
Sufferin' Succotash right now I'm bubbling, fuck a past
Google me, hoochie groupie, watch what I come up as
I'm the man in this bitch, so by demand in this bitch
Now, bitches want my attention like the Canibus diss
You ain't got no mechanical mandible quit handling dick
We liked you before the army, now we ain't a fan of your shit
You know my MAC pop, Detroit is my backdrop
Now, shut your ass up and go have some sex with your laptop
Ha, you too nerdy I'm too scurvy, one gun pointed at your head
My silhouette lookin' like two-thirty
The only thing in this life I can't fight is violence
Bar Exam 3 dropping same night the fight is
You sleeping, I'll take a knife and aim right for your eyelids
(SLAUGHTERHOUSE!) Right, I got an insane cypher
And if you step in my lane, claiming you way nicer
I'ma be wiping your brains off of my Range wipers
I will handle you, the .357 gon' handled, dude
The barrel stick out longer than the handle do
I'll shoot you, your crew, and the cops riding with you
I got issues, they call me ""Shots Fired"" Nickel
Equivalent to the psychical lock by a pitbull
To whip me is impossible
Rock a pinnacle, drinking the opposite of subliminal thinking
Compared to y'all, I'm a don, a criminal kingpin
I see why these niggas wanna run
When I invite them to the loneliest place in the world one-on-one
And tell your mama I'm a baller
Matter fact, tell your mama I'ma call her
Hurricane flowing like water, I'm grounded like Katrina
I sound like I fell in all New Orleans
Allow me to go Dionne Warwick (Warwick!)
And make a prediction for the future drama, I'm for it
You just melodic artists
I bring all of my private parts to your private party
And stick 'em inside your daughter
Psychotic aura, the hat on my head is not a fedora
The reason why your wifey's bottom is sorer
Benzino the hardest nigga? You know don't know him for hammers
You know him for talking shit with Norey behind the cameras
I blam at you I damage you
Wait—did I just say ""blam at you and damage you?""
Fuck it! These niggas amateurs
I handle toasters, I'm feeling like my Grammy closer
And your bitch can feel a ""ping"" like Emani Poster
Walkin' around with handheld ovens that ring
Or change your color like Sammy Sosa
I'm sicker, man, who grosser?
I spit it from the stomach with a ulcer
And if you want it, you can come in closer
And experience the taste of a knuckle sandwich
Waste your father, waste your mother, fuck your parents
Play with me, you know you playing on All-Madden
You all that until your potato get au gratin
You all phony, Tony Montana
'Til I stick you in the dirt and call you Earth-tone like fall fashion

Play My Music,The Bar Exam 4,2017.0,"I gotta move accordingly to how the music move
It's gon' predict my whole day

I said, I got that CeeLo plan, got that Migos plan
Got that mass appeal, that's that Primo plan
That Panamera tighty-white, that's that Speedo plan
Hope it ain't your time to die tonight, that's that sweet old man
Prayin' for my downfall, that's that evil plan
That's that Michael Jackson plan, that's that ""Beat It"" fam
Since he's never one to pull up on me, that's that traffic jam
Red dot on a nigga head, that's that Pakistan
Tell your bitch to shut up bitch, she do it, that's that slapper plan
Bought that Paul McCartney and Ferrari's plan
While I'm saying sorry and tryna get her back
I had gorillas see you with bananas, that Safari plan
Y'all just popped a molly, prolly popped a Xan'
I just popped a band-aid off the bands, that's that doctor plan
The static from that vinyl, that's that needle plan
That's my video on Vevo, that's that kilogram
My bitch be actin' like she tryna kill a nigga
In the sack like Dominic Leru my nigga, that's that Creole fam
That's that C.O. man, that's my P.O., damn
Shit just might get greasy for them Jacksons, that's that Tito, blam
4-4 pop right out of the compartment
Like I'm Robocop, I blow the locks right off your apartment door
It's your total shop, unloadin' loaded Glocks, patrollers rollin' by
You throw the dice, you rollin' though
You hot, or broke and old, you not
That's that Jay-Z plan, let H.O.V. play
Classics don't retire, let that Kobe play
Any man who disrespect me any kind of way
Gon' catch it every kind of way, that's that OBJ
Now I'm definitely buying recklessly
In front the FED's and IRS's nigga, that h-o-t way
That's that Stevie playing, that's that Beatles playing
That's my children saying, ""that's my hero man""
Other children saying, ""that's my car that he roll in""
That's that UFO, that's that take me to your leader man
Everyday I'm makin' change at the park when I go meet my man for that ticket, that's that meter man
Imposter snakes on hand, watch who shake your hand
While I got that draco pram, got that dako pram?
That shit there don't even match, that's that faithful fan
I ain't play that big today, 'cause that faith was playin'
That's that prisoner's plan, that's that princester's plan
That shit Detroit radio be playin', that's that insta-jam
Flossin' ain't the same, that's that dental plan
Classic gypsy band, that's that Hendrix plan
Couple people had to keep the mad at this is man 'cause he keeps begging me to drink again, that drag you with me plan
Baddest night is playin', I'm glad this night is playin'
Somebody got to die tonight, I'm sippin' tonics, fam
Manicure my hands, that's that polish man
Had to throw my hands, that's that wylin' man
Dirt all on my hands, blood all on my hands
Murder, it never show my hands, that's psychotic man
That's that Ricky Rose plan, that's them OJ's plan
While I fuck my bitch in Calabasas, that's that 4 AM
She was just a virgin when we met, so I murdered that shit
And it fit me like a fucking glove, that's that OJ fam

Made a couple dollars, might've copped a jewel or two

Who Got Bodied?! (Mistah F.A.B. Diss),The Bar Exam 2.5 ,2007.0,"Now I done told this nigga to shut his mouth
I guess he wasn't hearin' me
I'm beyond this peon, he's scared of me
Apparently he don't see that he don't compare to me
Cause he ain't remain silent like T.I.'s security
It's clear to me he'll fuck up his own cash
Now take your little freestyle and shove it up your ass
Followed by the ""oohs"" and ""aahs""
Your foolish pride done fucked around
And put you on the losing side, who got bodied?
Nigga, you sick? Then I'm a hot toddy
Coke flow, I spit so much Whitney I got Bobby
I'm a sound off, this nigga's a clown y'all
Fifty niggas with him wearin' jheri curls, hoppin' out of clown cars
Shows over Bozo, no mo', I'm back
Time to face the music, I'mma just straight up abuse him
He choose to diss, but he don't know what he gettin'
While he's spittin' funny shit, I'm gettin' money bitch
C'mon I'm a product of my environment
He ain't gotta try to bring Malcolm out of retirement
He go at me I hit him ASAP, take that
Get shot up like a cap gun at a race track
He's probably from the part of the Bay where the gay's at
Where the fags migrate and give each other AIDS at
They told me that you ain't the pistol type
So yo, you know to me that means you a Frisco dyke
Get you a whoopin' like Whoopie
You steppin' in another circle
I wear Purple Label you just wear The Color Purple
Everything about your lame flow represents everything ho
And every color in the rainbow
Sayin' Proof's name will get you strangled
Let my nigga rest or I bet you gon' be sleepin' with the angels
I'm fly, you a fly, since you lie, you die, goodbye

Zip 'em up
Zip 'em up
Zip 'em up
Zip 'em up

C'mon, you showed you ain't got respect soon
As you diss me so sudden
So when you bow it better look like you toe touchin'
I'm so fuckin' ridiculous with the flow cousin
I pack heat and I will give you the whole oven
Coke, heroin, flower, fuck it the whole cupboard
No publishin' for this fuck it, I'm so stubborn
I threw the bait, you took it, I'm on the boat buzzin'
Reelin' you in, tryin' to eat you before Joe Budden

Budden said the battle was embarrassin'
Comparison, this shit here more embarrassin'
So I'mma use his beat to murk you
And maybe he'll see that I'll murk him too
I'm just playin' my nigga Buddens, you cool
I'm just fuckin' with you cause I got ""Nothin To Do""
This Mistah Fag, he's a waste of my time
And my time is money so I'm wastin' money just makin' this rhyme
It ain't beef but I would like to shoot your jeweler
Your charm look like some kind of retarded school bus
All you missin' is the ""duh"" and the drool
The wheelchair, the helmet and the confused look
Niggas get shook when Malcolm speaks
There ain't no way I can hear you on an Alchemist beat
Y'all two doin' an album together, ooh shit
Okay, I got a sample for you, loop this:

Step right up! Step right up
Let me guess your weight
I just flew in from San Francisco and boy are my arms tired!
Step right up and watch me shoot through birds out of my sleeve
I'm so fuckin' funny
Let's take it to the Bay baby

Mistah F.A.B. I'm funny
I'm a clown, with no money
Every Monday, I get a haircut
To wear a t-shirt and jeans with airbrush
I'm corny, I'm corny
There goes the real Fab, he came before me
It's not corny, he's still here too
But I don't care cause, I'm so funny

The streets will teach you
I love for The Bay nigga, Skee my people
The problem is, you think you lyrically my equal
But that don't balance out I gotta Keak the Sneak you
You be the bitch, nigga we be the shit
You never slang like 40, you tryin' to be B-Legit
I will eat your soul
My piece's cold cause they freeze
But these hoes is Keyshia Cole, I'll put you in the hospital
You ain't the only one that got riddles, I got two
Check it, one: Flabby, Fabby, fuck you
Fucked yo mammy, we family cause I'm yo daddy, son
Two: Yeah, pussy thought you took me
Want a cookie? Cause nobody seems to care
So what's the fuss 'bout
Turn your girl's mouth to a Yukmouth
Nut, turn her out to a slut house, who got bodied?

""Trick hates your guts and Proof ain't never like you""
""I fuck with real Detroit niggas like Trick Trick and Chedda Boys""
Ask about me

I got A.K.s, A.R.s, aye y'all
This nigga been dead since the 8th bar
But I'm tryin' to overkill him
Standin' over the silly nigga holdin' a shotty
With the spirit shootin' at him 'til his body disappears
Lookey here, I will put your crew in boxes
I done put whole crew in boxes
And it best he stops cause I will Freddie Foxxx him
Put him out with the tools or boxing
So think about your next move, I will let you choose your option
Top ten, dead or alive, and I got soldiers
You cast your little punk ass stones at me, I throw back boulders!
Oh yeah, it's over, hold that
Nigga this is G's up, I speed up right where you slow at
Lyrically you Borat, boring, do anything for a laugh
You know that's... annoying
It's sounds that perhaps you doubt me
Well if you ever ever make it to my city, ask about me
Your luck's over 'cause all you tried to do is be famous
So now you famous nationwide for gettin' fucked over
Boy pay up, I ball, this a fo' sho' lay up
I'm playin' Chess with a Connect Four player!

It's obvious I hear you talkin' loud
I'm clappin' all day like I'm cheerin' in the crowd
I'm bout to catch a body, I'ma bust a mag boy
I'm bout to catch a body, I'ma bust a mag boy
I'll kill ya'! If you ain't never ran from a nigga
Then you damn sure should probably pick a day to start runnin'
Get runnin'! If you ain't never ran from a nigga
Then you damn sure should probably pick a day to start runnin'

Fuck that beef shit, that shit is played out
Why is it harder for peace over violence?

It always got to be that one nigga that's the loudest
That ain't gon' do no poppin' when it's time to be about it
Rah-rah-rah-rah, fuck outta here with that shit
You puttin' way too much passion into that wack shit
Put your dukes down nigga, we come in peace
With them AK-47's, we from the streets
Calm down, shhhh, you so emotional
I know where you're at in your career is such a low for you
I understand it, but understand this, my daddy taught me manners
So it's foreign to fly off the handle and talk to cameras
That shit is lame, lames we don't respect
We wonderin' why the fuck you so upset
We know the streets'll swallow you, look what that powder do
Look at you try to embody what's not really inside of you
I promise you, that if you chill now, in 5 years
I will not ride through the McDonald's drive thru and bother you
I'm here for fries, that's it, chicken nuggets
Give me some sweet and sour sauce too and quit your buggin'
I'm just above it, I'm too mature for this
It ain't smart to go to war for this

Y'all know the rest, get your dough, biters
Y'all goin' left, get your M.O. in check
Later with them vendettas, handle your liquor better
Let's play some tennis, go back and forth, who winnin'?
You will give into a Koch deal away from *finished*
Fuck outta here with that, step your bars up
Your shit is garbage, what, you tryin' to kick knowledge? Be honest
Step your cars up, that little Benz you know is lame
I'd rather ride in a remote control Soulja Boy chain
I'm so insane, I flow with open flame
Note to self: leave him floatin' if he spoke your name
That's why I don't bother nobody
I catch a body all alone cause I don't ride with nobody

Raw, imperial cats is wieldin instrumental war
Rap tactical macks perform unspeakable acts
And hope on vengeance, exposin your pretenders
To the laws and battle nature performance under the gun
And we move, with maximum efficiency to your redundant
And shake, we dominate 'em on old fashion, break 'em with a power
Like glass jaws, fresh we outta grammar inflict force
We grapple your mental with word tentacles sick
Manipulate your heart rate through brain chemicles slick
I slide through like lubrication on a Latex
Fuckin your thought process hard like date-rape sex
Smokin cigarettes slow and once your cherry glow red
Cause I'mma see the satisfaction in the end
My caliber big time designed to be fatal
And crush a nigga windpipes slow with my cables
They feel this soloist soon, this cat controllin the womb
I'm movin cracks like they body consume
Certified but my ability's skill, license to kill
And carry the heavy weaponry, ill like pentetiaries

Yo.. it's several different levels to pickin up shovels
And dumpin you in ditches under sea level, frontin you can witness
Let me refreshin you niggas tell you my position in this
Beef! Leavin you under Venice, opposition finished!
Here it is, we invaded created a Pyramid
Of a Haven of names, so blame Dre and that ear of his
So {*heavy breathing*} breathe, I'd rather REACH for your neck
And I never HEAT you for respect, unless you GREET me wit less
I got a skunk, in my trunk
I'm lyin, I got a pump in my trunk
You dyin, how many lumps niggas want?
Who's ready for y'all? We ready for y'all
We too incredibly raw, for any artist that said he would draw
I stand firm, and it hurts to live it
You open up that can of worms, I hope you ready for the dirt that's wit it

Price to sell tour, rap sell out stores
Somethin to live for, double my street value
Clear-cut your colony, and balance the economy

I'm not a jolly good fellow
But still can't deny me

And jog about seven miles before class start
Had dreams of being the next superstar
Like that boy Usain Bolt
Kenny’s ambition was crazy
In his heart he was determined to get it
So he stuck to it
Six days out the week kenny hit the track
With his goals set high, he ain’t turning back
Lost one too many of his friends over guns and crack
Kenny put it in his mind there’s something better then that
His daddy called him flypaper the way he stuck to the track
His momma said “it’s your time baby you can’t turn back.""
And through all the blood, sweat, and the tears
Kenny promised the fan for 40 years
To come, got to get it
He shall prosper
Jumping hurdles in life ‘til the next one pop up

I’ve been trying so hard
To erase the scars
Of living this life
On the boulevard
Ohh, on the boulevard
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Every morning Kenny wake up at 9 AM
Hit the traphouse and stay there til its 5 AM
I call that trappin' pages
He always holdin his dick, always busting off
But I dont call that masterbation
He all about heart
And you will never hear “Oh my god they killed Kenny”
Bitch this ain’t South Park
This the dirty mittens scurvy conditions
Workers is stealin, stealers is workin
You only as real as the nigga you murdered
Bullets fly to your chest leak
Treat you like you a crownless chess piece
Middle finger never up, thats a substituted waste
Why would he do that when can just tell you niggas “Fuck You” to your face?
He could fill up y'all with philly’s boulevard bully
To pull your card with no regards for the laws, wearing a hoodie
Police on his trail, he toss the bird
Roll his window down like “Can I help you office-errrrr?”

I’ve been hustlin' for so long
The streets just won’t leave me alone
It’s a battle that I’ve gotta win
I can’t give in

I’ve been trying so hard
To erase the scars
Of living this life
On the boulevard
Ohh, on the boulevard
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Bound for destiny, for greatness
Yet they both struggled with the 9-7
As evidence they were meant to be more
Yet they can’t seem to finally find the score
Cuz the game they played was rigged from the beginning
And in the end I sit on the sidelines and cry
Both Kennys stuck in a parallel universe will lose their lives",https://genius.com/Royce-da-59-on-the-boulevard-lyrics
Where My Money,Success Is Certain,2011.0,"I've been fucking with this game for a long time and I'm impatient
I'mma kill somebody if somebody don't make me real rich this year

For starters, I'm all about the bread
I ain't no artist, I'm a target, I'm like the landlord
Hip hop's currently fallen down the stairs
Your rents due, muthafucka!
Now who gives a fuck about who bar is the hardest?
When the DJs think they're bigger stars than the artists
Riding around in Ferraris doing more A&Ring than the A&Rs
And half them niggas don't even scratch
That's like the blind leading the blind leader
Hip-hop is like the FBI in the trap readin' The Don Diva
It makes no sense, it's ironic how I can straighten you
Even though I stay so bent
I'm about getting ins, everytime my money's on hip hop
That's every time the house nigga wins
Flooding the drought, loving the club, Crip/Blood gun talk
Ladies and gentlemen: hip hop in one bar

I've been fucking with this game for a long time and I'm impatient
I'mma kill somebody if somebody don't make me real rich this year
Where my money at?

I put a cease and desist on this industry shit
Me making a friend means I just make an enemy quit
When niggas think they finna be big, their images switch
They go from getting beat by a nigga to sweet to a cinnamon whip
They acting like they got the Vanna White in Wheel of Fortune
But actually they spilling the script
I tell her DJ to play mines, or we gon' spray ya
And that's on every MC's mind, they just don't say it
I flame spots, my brain lies and the top is on fire
How you gonna say Nickle Nine ain't rising
Rappers no longer have to be on the block lying
You get your ass whooped on the net, you a pop icon
I spazz like I got the right rhyme
I flash like a shot Nikon
I call my motherfuckin' man my money, so money stands out
While I got my motherfuckin' hand out

I've been fucking with this game for a long time and I'm impatient
I'mma kill somebody if somebody don't make me real rich this year

Niggas is fucking lameos, I wanna see you dead
Fuck you mean, you ain't gay?
You get more anal than a sneaker head
It's Thanksgiving, it's turkey time, pick up an Indian midget
Flip him and dip his turban in turpentine
I'm fly, my mic is like a star
Lady Liberty herself can light my cigar
I can't lose, come through with them bruisers
We all got furs on like we at the fight with Frank Lucas
My clip'll buck at you, I'll fuck a bitch, let her suck my dick
You? You sweat her, Cliff Huxtable
Y'all niggas tense in this bitch, you carry guns for self defense
I play off-fence with this bitch
I don't stop beefing until I hear sirens
I'll eat you before I get a meal, like five wings

And she drink sizzurp, I call her Eileen

It doesn't mean that I'm putting my middle finger up

I'm 'bout to life the shotty, bullets hit your body
It's gon' be a long Talladega Night, Ricky Bobby
I spit 100% pure, Whitney, Bobby
Fuck bitches, all I do is fuck bitches
She in my hotel room at 1, 1:10, she in the lobby
The pump's the shotty
So tell your momma find me in your city high
And I'm prolly gon' be drunker than Robby
I got a new college bitch, she be like:
""Yeah, we should get together sometime
Maybe go to a party and dance.""
I said: ""Yeah, that'd be a no, cause I'm not a partying man
But I'll definitely still put you on the list for the party in my pants.""
I got a hustler flow
For fifty mil, I will drink Manny Pacquiao's blood

I Hate Your Pants,The Bar Exam 3: The Most Interesting Man,2010.0,"Come away with me
Let's journey to a land where men, are men
And I wish, that this all was a dream
Those skinny jeans, how do you get yo' balls in them things?
And the day that my son should want a pair
That's gon' be the same day that I put a gun to my head
And why would you want your booty to stick out?
Just be glad you're not in jail

You are gay to me, and that's okay to me
But I still hate your pants
You're a fag to me, long as you're happy, be
But that don't mean I have to like your pants

Where did you buy those things? Are those designer jeans?
Cause I haven't seen 'em at Saks
And I wish, that this all was a dream
You got a crotch like a Ken doll in them jeans
And there's no way I should be able to see the imprint of your knees
And them jeans, make you look like you got big feet
And I wish that y'all would quit it with that dance
And I hope y'all go to hell

You are gay to me, and that's okay to me
But I still hate your pants
You're a fag to me, long as you're happy, be
But that don't mean I have to like your pants

Skinny jeans really, gross me out
It's just the whole concept, you know?
Pullin them over your hairy man ass
And then, havin' to peel them off your hairy legs
It's disgusting,  
Mickey Factz was
In the same room with Joey, when he got punched in the eye

I blame it on the skinny jeans cause he couldn't react fast enough

I bang my weapon, I think grotesque shit before I bless this
Ink on my paper, I R-A-K-I-M with my efforts
I K-R-S it, AK's my preference, how dare y'all mess with me
Lyrically, I bury y'all best shit, I'm here to carry out y'all death wish

Like injecting bloggers with infections
They can't digest it
They rate my albums, they taint my message
They can't digest it
Call this Inception, Shawshank Redemption
This is my movie, pardon my special effects
I'm sittin' in my jacuzzi
Blessings on blessings, one of us eating
One can't digest shit
I let you pull my chain, I might as well let you come take my necklace
Used to pay out without gettin' back shit
Now I'm collecting, plugging, connected
But know that definitely ain't my confession
Block got turned up like Tetris
Got problems I need correcting
I'm out here bird watching, plus I got a Popeye's obsession
Hot thighs and breasts has guys out right now tryna impress them
Feels like I'm at a drive thru makin' a final selection
This chick tryna find out who I slept with
I'm 'bout to let it happen cause who I smashed was her best friend, that's misdirection
Dealing with women with friends
One thing I learned is my lesson
This like Bob Evans, they share sausage but can't digest it

But then God created the woman
And the woman needed to led by something other than man
So he created the queen
Tiara, get 'em

They can't digest this
Food for thought cause this flow don't sit well in your small intestines
You know I grace these tracks
Yo eyes closed, amen, yes I blessed it
They can't contest it
No competitions, oh no contestants
I'm giving lessons
Eyes on my pupils, yes, class in session
I do this with no effort, no stressing, so no compression
They fuel off my aggression, I kill shit, that's my profession
You try to come bum my spot, better think twice
Yes, use your discretion
I eat, sleep, breathe my passion for music, this my obsession
Look, hop in the booth and take off
Yep, rocket ship, I'm rockin' shit
Making this hard to digest
I pass right by you chicks, I buy you chicks
Like I'm Warren Sapp, I fly right by you chicks
You say yo cap is fire, whoo
Well, I'm gon' light this fire, bitch
Step if you wanna, I'm wreckin' you up
Talking lots of shit but I'm backin' you up
Get that ass hit like you backin' it up
And I'm killin' the game like the casket is shut
Digest it, they can't digest it
Caitlyn's a man but she's wearin' dresses
They can't digest it
Police killing people where there ain't no justice
They can't digest it
Paris invaded by all the terrorists
We can't digest it
Cure for diseases but never get 'em
How they 'sposed to make money if they ain't got no one infected?
The world gon' end real soon, especially if Trump gets elected

Fuck is wrong with you? 
Go and inform your crew
That I can end your career in less than a song or two
I'm a tyrant, I'm like an irate Somalian pirate
You're as threatenin' as Miley Cyrus with the heine virus
Dead a verse, 
I got more bars than Leavenworth
The present president backwards, call me ""Tnediserp""
I shoot niggas with knives, stab niggas with guns
Kiss hands and shake babies
, I make the medic hurt
Fuck a producer too, them faggots is fuckboys
I should rap over the Brinks truck backin' up noise
The city's in an uproar over the hustl-or
I got it on lock like up north but much more
These rap niggas sayin' they rollin' on them wheels
But the only rollin' they doin' is rollin' on the pill
They high, speakin' of rollin', we a roll
You will see us get paper before you see us fold
Hip hop nigga, the opposite of neo-soul
The only thing sing is the pistol when I'm takin' Ne-Yo's soul
You aspire to get a chain that's glistenin'
I aspire to get a chain of businesses
I retire niggas, gettin' at me ain't what the business is
I kill the kitten if he witnesses
I make it look easy, before I self destruct
I'ma get some hoes pregnant like 50 and Lil Weezy
I don't give a fuck about shit
Got nothin' to say to y'all but ""suck dick"", I fuck yo' bitch
And send her back to you, pussy like she been in labor dawg
And when I'm done with her she gon' need a cable all
My dream mistress is a bitch like Nicki Minaj
And if the ass ain't real then I'm with the façade
The pistol, the pen, drinkin' with me, pick your demise
The silencers screwed on now the clips in disguise
Now who the fuck goin' harder than Nickel
I take a shit on any nigga, no regard for tissue
I go hard; so much harder than everybody
I John Doe tag the toe of every body

We go hard

make him swallow shells
That'll clog his windpipe

make the doctor do the Heimlich
Fightin' for the loot like a riot; this is Pay-Per-View
Rap niggas don't get it unless they buyin' this
Blame it on the drugs like Steve-O, 
you still a Jackass
I spit dope, my fans got a crack habit
If you can beat me on beats congrats
The sore loser when I snatch him out the booth then I beat his ass
What you call rappin', I call trash
Every punch you call strong, I call jabs, so listen
I'm sicker than a stripper, if you tip her, give her fifties and twenties
Hit the lights she realize it's counterfeit money
My niggas get large cash
Push the rock good as Bobby Hurley 'fore the car crash
I get star cash, tour cash, more cash
Don't wanna pay me, I'mma take it out of your ass
Do what you want fam, I say fam cause I fry a man
Feelin' angry man, I'll flight 'em in
Honestly godly, what fool wanna battle me?
I use the Earth as a cue and shoot pool with the galaxy
Few could challenge me, who do catastrophe
Three cash, guns point the guard, I'm Steve Nash
You a rap group, I'll slap through
The only time you see a gun is when mine is pointin' at you
Skip the church and the reverend 
I'mma put 'em on a 747
And the destination's Heaven
For example, break into my notebook
And find more shit than the cops friskin' Rambo
Make 'em fade to black, fit 'em for a blindfold

I'm back ready to rap took a little nap ready to go off
Stick to my pen, never again will I ever dose off
No more bozo rap it hurt me
The new dojo in beast mode, I'm John Cleese, no mercy!
My saliva and spit could fly through a brick
Put your ass by a light and spit gas at the fire flick
Gave up homie huh? I was worse than the racists and rapists
Now I', feeling like Kobe 'fore he scored 81
Really feeling new! missed me with the skinny jeans and uggs
Fuck outta here, I ain't feeling you!
Fucking incredible! I can dig a hole to hell
Just to beat the devil over the head with a fucking shovel!

When I stepped on the pedal the pipes turned to Bubba Sparxxx
Called Delano up, turned the rally stripes to fucking art
Then introduced my son to Teyana Taylor at Rucker Park
Look, fag, this BE4, I don't have no E-G-O
You don't want no static eh, y'all should have your TV low
Y'all the fakes, these are the breaks, y'all the cast of CB4
Am I an underground artist? No, I'm completely low
I'm so low I could sell this booth as my new cellar
I could sell a Jewish fella suit to a shrewd tailor
Who better? I can sell a shovel to the Devil
Then turn around and I can sell the scoop to a newsletter
Feeling like God only kicked Moses on the snare
Allah on the flyer and this bitch emoting on a prayer
Fuck these labels, fuck you label hoes focused on despair
Fuck radio, I'm already floating on the air
I ain't here to be famous in debt, do my thing to me dead
These fans are programmed to change and forget
In this white man's world I'm just a black who ain't in the red
Who hasn't had a hat he can hang on regret
Rappers kind of rapping too tame to collect
Who has a rather insane intellect
I would rather ride a train to success
That's plain than ride a dragonfly through a flame to impress
Maybe I'm Red, maybe I'm Meth, maybe I'm less
Maybe I'm crazy like Macy Gray, baby, I'm blessed
The hoes praising me like maybe I'm next

I'm so amazing, I'm Jay Z, I'm Treach
I'm feeling like KRS in the flesh
In the 80s, but more 94' Shady I guess
We taking the feeling back from the wealthy, rich and shining
Uncla Murda this and Suge is more healthy for the genre
Porsche pushing, motor whoofing
Under the hood it sound like horses hoofing
I never ran from a soul, but I got promoters booking
I keep a hand full of something to fold
I'm just here to tell you the facts
The mayor slipped and fell through the cracks
Like the quarter's is under your sofa cushion

Bitch I'm illy, hotter than the Denaun milly
You probably happy tonight, but after I strike
You gon' need to fit your bitch with a tracking device
A Ho-Jack, your ho vulnerable like no strap
You on a Mountain rocking a Brokeback
Haha, you faggoty acting
While me and your bitch is engaging in tragedy passion
Pass me your ex
I'm tryna hit Kim Kardashian now, and then Cassie is next
Diddy you wrong, I feel bad for Ryan Leslie, I woulda at least said

I got a thing for your girlfriend
She got a face of a goddess, ooh-wee, you already know
Don't, d-d-don't blame me
Don't, d-d-don't blame me
Excuse me miss, I'm just passing
Hope you don't mind me asking
Are you lookin for some action?
Cause I wouldn't mind waxing that ass",https://genius.com/Royce-da-59-thing-for-your-girlfriend-lyrics

See that's just, the universe working boy
It's natural
See that's just, the universe working

I seen it all
Done it all
I guarantee y'all there'll be some soul searching involved
If we done lost one of ours
We was taught be a boss
Money, cars, beating off
And something with the engine in the trunk dawg
With three exhausts
Decision making, free it cost
Discount me, then we'll talk
Cause talk is cheap
Momma 'cross the street tryin' see us off
To college
We out here against all the non-belief
My Walkman is playing Malik, Jamal and Bahamadia
Still haven't figured out yet what I want my sound to be
Still rough around the edges
Fighting and waiving around the piece
In response to that 9/11
That night I got that beep
Or that shit got tied to me
I just wanted to rhyme
And everything that flashed in front of my eyes felt like some trick photography
I had to go to open mics to show a different side of me
There's more to me than hoppin' over fences bro
It's gotta be
My calling, I gotta put my all in, the entire me
I'm starving
Momma pressin' five, collect callin'
Nine times in like two days
Now it's time to find new ways
To put that 5 and that 9 to use, eyy
There's significance in numbers as a youngin'
I thought of my first corny punchline from a chick who sucked my dick the longest
I was like ""If I stick my dick in her ear I wonder if the bitch can hear me cumming""
Niggas from around the way I grew up with is in the kitchen peelin' onions
While they momma's drop the tears that's from it
AKs that gunnin' to this day I still hear the drummin
I'm A1, I figured I'd end up with straight A's in something
Them growing pains were like Novacane
Boy they made us numbin'
I followed my gut like I ate a compass
I put all of my trust in my native stomach
My uncle Ozee got rich before me
Told me to save my money
And showed me dough he gave me none of
And he ain't even my shady or my crazy uncle
That's just on my momma's side
We ain't gon' talk about my fathers side
Ain't nothing over there but a bunch of drug use and homicide
I been through some things that should've left me traumatized
But didn't
See, these were just experiences
I was 10, my father tried to spank me with his hand
Not knowing I'm holdin' a pen
Before he knew it the pen went straight through his hand
Imagine me, him and my mom at the Hospital tryin' to explain this one y'all
Doctor like ""wow, you were trying that hit that kid pretty hard""
I Had to talk to the cops like look ""this is just who we really are!""
Montgomery's my nigga
Montgomery's my nigga
When my uncle was living he couldn't babysit me for long
Cause he might pop and turn somebody high-top to a Gumby right in front of me
And I'mma need to get blood wiped out my onesie my nigga
Montgomery's my nigga
Montgomery's my nigga
Sometimes I want to just want to die
Sometimes I just want to cry rivers
But I got to stay alive for my mother, my son and my sister
My daughter, my wisdom
All that I have is all that I give them

I fuck with you, respect you
You fuck with me, respect me
You come for me, expect me

Heartbeat,Build and Destroy,2003,"I know that you know I can rip it, I hope that you listen
Blood burgundy soul, heart cold, surgery flowed
They operate like an emergency (Listen to my heartbeat)
Harder, I know that you know I can rip it, I hope that you listen

Listen, I know my position, I'm young, your profection is distant
I run to it, it feels like it comes closer but misses
I been exposed to the most vicious, meanin' I know the difference
Between those that are dope or those that are Pulp Fiction
My words are weapons, they serve and protect
Behind verbs and a lesson I teach for the nerve that your testin'
I'll reach you from like thirty directions
Heat you like, the early detections like he questions the reaper to strike
Your number it came and crumbled your fame, into a ball
A umbrella dissolved into flames, you under my brain
You fell in my shower, lyrics my power
Your time is now, this is your hour to listen and it's windin' down
Your mission to make your way if your smart
He play his part, you can never take away his heart, listen

They operate like an emergency (Listen to my heartbeat)
Harder, I know that you know I can rip it, I hope that you listen

My spit is like a fix or the rinse cycle that gets
Under the dirt, that gets, under the skirt of your bitch
Under your nose, so get onto your toes
This is the reason you ballers is leavin' me all in control, my brother
You should play the back if you loud, I make you fade the black
If you wild so you should stay in back and be proud
I never take for granted my style cause him who handed it down
To me, Slim who demanded, take advantages now
I'm breezin' away from competitive ways
Every day I'm leavin' a race, I'm leadin' every step of the way
That I'm breathin' and the reason that the hunger's increased
I'm under my peeps speed and I'm underneath the numbers I seek
I speak if you never show me respect
No longer lookin' up to rappers, in fact I’m after the ones that I’ve met

Royce Is Like,The Bar Exam,2007.0,"Well, nothin left to do but rhyme circles around niggas
Huh, Preem? (Huh?)

Allow me to put it in perspective, check this
Bullets in the Tec shit, spinning and the bullet in your chest is
Best shit, meddling, what else niggas peddling?
'Cause you selling records around here is irrelevant (Statik!)
Allow me to tell you to bow whenever you around me
I'm proud 'cause God endowed me, intelligent
Look up in the sky and crown me, the now-regal
She go down, her knees are now eagle
Either my gun gon' bang or I'ma come harder
I run water on y'all lames, I unthaw you
Y'all wanna be the kings of rap, my son's smarter
I'd rather run some game on one of Run's daughters
The Mike Vick or the Kobe Bryant with this one
I'm past the pass and homie, Ryan, I just run
The Last Action Hero that the public awaits
Took it past rapping so perhaps I can govern your state
I'm Akinyele, I act Belly, so put it in your mouth
While I talk on the celly, pushing a black L-E-
I'm Makaveli, my body's in the back of a deli
Holding a cordless, frozen, with the volts in swordfish
Lying with a couple of corpses
Biggie and Gandhi, my city's behind me, others enforce it
In the Philippines, blacking out on mics, yeah
Like I'm living in a dream, acting out a nightmare
Whatever I'm saying's real
Shovel the bullshit y'all throw on the game
Is how I level the playing field (Woo!)
Y'all got to feel me, momma had to make me
God got to kill me, y'all would have to basically
Put me up on a cross, split my flows up
Call on the Bible and let 'em lift my soul up (Yeah!)
Oh my, true, amen and such
The liaison between the most high and you (Yes!)
Uncle Paul, the bearer of bad news
The era of unified armor, beware of the suicide bomber
The way he shoots the cannon
He competing with the reaper, he will take you, then vanish
Make you understand it
Shots be popping off bilingual, papi, call me Jesús in Spanish
I keep calm, I keep my piece on
I'm like Ice-T, I keep a bleach blonde
I'm like Spike Lee, I keep the floor seats so it's sweet
Y'all might not like me but no need for response
My recon's ghostly, we prime
Real estate of the minds 'cause we signed and re-signed
They say I'm at the end of my time like Esham
My emergency brakes recalled like Nissan
Peace, y'all, I'm out, niggas; I'm 'bout figures
But before I leave, I hope you don't doubt there's a...

Deep karma that's surrounding me
Like I'm a drug dealer plugged into the weed farmer
Rap NATO, plus, blasting, that's fatal
You do the math and you'll have mashed your last 'tato (Shh!)
The big empire, go within fire
The boss is so high on top, it's a kickstand by him
I am: Ryan, the giant; spit, inspire
I kill the supplier; then, I'm peeling the hitman hirer
I flow like none, you blow like guns
You hoes is polite as the soul of a Moabite nun
I'm like a Glock beam, I'm usually unseen
'Til I wanna be seen, that means one thing
So I know I be having fun being a showout
I keep my guns clean with sunscreen, I'm so hot
Petrified, ain't ya? Shook to death, ain't ya?
Bitch niggas know you; told you, I'm a stranger
I ain't seen fear, don't even know what it feel like (Uh-huh!)
I'm out of Vice City, the nigga hood in real life (Uh-huh!)
Caddy-ass niggas'll get it
I pay the cost to put you away while I'm golfing
Look, now, I'm flossing
I drive the ball then yell, ""War!""
I mean, yell, ""Fore!"" right before I unveil the pale horse
Cock on sight, orgy or the duel
We doing like hoes or fours, who will we ruin?
Asking each other to answer answered questions
Then forgets them, I'll do 'em again, I guess
But you ain't gotta be dumb to go it (Uh-uh)
I'm too old to show it
I'm too blowed, but too young to blow it
Any time it comes to showing, I runs the show
When it comes to flowing, I go and becomes the poet
You know I capitalize by blacking out on a rhythm
I visualize the action and actualize the vision (Yeah, yeah)
I don't have to rely on ambition to get my eye on them digits
I see how I see, then get right on my business
Let me see, I'm finna choose between losing
And being the pinnacle between eaten and eating dinner food
To being interviewed, and squeeze into a closet
With a couple of tennis shoes, I call it being defeated
Minuscule amounts of dough in a dual account
So your ho can go on with you on an ounce
Sold, rounds of bottles around her mouth
That's bound to swallow, counting all of them founding fathers
You choose: getting brains or sniffing for the coochie scent
50 Gs in the chain'll glisten with the Gucci print
Basically, how I move, New York'll seem slow
You hood-rich? How I'm living? You're pork-and-bean poor

I can't complain, nigga, I pimp the game
You went to jail, nigga, I went to change
Wipe off the smirk, nigga, we ain't the same
You came to do dirt, I came to clean
You drown from hunger, I sank from fame
You shot through windows, I paints the pane
I can't explain, nigga, you ain't been trained
The same way that I have, so you ain't to blame
If you ain't ashamed, you came to swing, nigga
I came extreme, this is my claim to fame (Yeah!)
You claim the fame; I cop the jewel
Right 'fore you cop the jewel after I change the chains (Chains!)
You seem deranged, I got a thing for brains (Brains!)
You flee from rain, nigga, I reign supreme
You hang your keys up, I hang with Preem
You claiming, ""Gs up,"" I'm claiming King
I came to slang, nigga, you came to fiend
When I'm playing arenas, you came to scream
You came to bling, nigga, I came to shine (Shine)
You came to sing, nigga, I came to grind (One more time)
You came to bling, nigga, I came to shine (Shine)
You came to sing, nigga, I came to grind",https://genius.com/Royce-da-59-royce-is-like-lyrics

Hooooh-ooooh-ooooh
No, no, no

I done been in this game for years, it made me an animal
I learned that nobody else can be held accountable
But you for your career, not your manager, face it
Even he can fuck up a relationship
I learned it don't matter who's spittin better
While these rappers kill each other, them Jews they stick together
Like glue; and generate more money than FUBU
For somethin made 'for you by you'
Every hip-hop nigga listen and wishin' he had your style'll
Go against you if you rip him or pass him by (yeah)
A mastermind is somebody who's actually kind
To everybody, and try to see every autograph is signed
The humblest way to look at your career
Is every nigga in here is one hit away (yeah)
Whatever goes around in rap
Happens to not come back to me, and I ask you

If I was to die today
Would you pick me up because I'm down and out?
Na, na, na

""T"" represents the time when my hope fades
""O"" is just a sign on my mind on my broke days
""D"" is for the dangerous way that the flow stray
""A"" represents the answer to the question I'm askin'
""Y"" is it today I should (die)

Damn, right after one quick summer
Am I a Young MC or a one-hit wonder?
Is it a following that supports me
BET, MTV, or ""E! True Hollywood Story""?
Can I hold my own and rap
Without havin' to go back to Pharrell or Poke & Tone?
Can a married man still appeal to broads
Knowin everything he's spittin from here on in gon' be raw?
Can a nigga simply spit that real shit
Just for niggas that feel me or will the system kill me? (uhh)
If I drop this album and it sells
And the next one don't top it, will it be considered a failure?
If I had to drop outta the limelight for a while
Would you still mob me? Hell naw!
You would not give a fuck about me
If I worked a regular job, I don't even gotta ask y'all

If I was to die today
Would you pick me up because I'm down and out?
Na, na, na

""O"" is just a sign on my mind on my broke days

We just wanna see you survive
Anytime you wanna talk, maybe either one of y'all
Wanna give a holla this way (yeah)
Every lady involved is rootin for the underdog
You don't let him die today, no!
Oh no - we ain't tryin' to see
You go - I want you here beside me
I don't want it to change - don't die!

Now as far as my weaknesses
I have a hard time competin' or charting on SoundScan
And Mediabase, I respect Dre for teachin' me that
Money is easy to make, but hard to keep
As far as my nigga 'Los, I love him
He showed me you can do a dope album with no budget (yeah)
With lethal rhymes - they get that
He brought you into the game, he can take you out outta people's minds (yeah)
(Die) Those who feel my career will die
Those who choose to leave me behind
Are confused cause they don't hear me cry; rather ya ears
Is ready or not, I know you can hear me now like Mary J. Blige
I will take the shit
I will burn yo' bridges and I ain't talkin 'bout our relationship
What goes around comes around with every person
Rather it's life or rap whatever, ""Death Is Certain""

Bank full of what’s stitched on the left side of my Nikes
Blank man fill me in but you will never sum me up, there will never be another question mark like me
I don’t gang bang shit I’m just mad blazing
I got them dimes like a bad Asian
I got them nicks like some bad shaving
A lot em with the gang bang
She say she wit it a matador like I’m red flag waving
I go with cigs when you come with kids
So I hope you run youngest son under dick
So long live crime, long kiss bye
I’m a Rottweiler I am truly hot lava
Have your pops hollering the wrong kid died turn him into Dewey Cox father, I age better than suede leather
The winner and the fall Dopeman fuck the talk lets agree that I ain’t the Pacman and Mayweather
Got bitches chasing dick I feel like hanging out, shit take 'em wit snap my fingers make them sit
You? you roll around with a pack of niggas, you got the click Mel Gibson wish for rapist bitch
He got the cops around him, I’m rocking like a crack head momma, chicken in the crib, baby in the oven
That basically means she laying in some hot surroundings
Crazy is the governing Shady is the covenant
Come with Immaculate concepts like nobody birthed me
I treat the game like Rick James did Charlie Murphy

Son Of Greg,UnKnown,2014.0,"Son of Greg, child of God
Eyes closed off cause I'm trying to decide
How to coincide with father time
Then my eyes go wide
Cause I'm trying to tightrope walk on my bottom line
Same time I'm trying to fight those thoughts
This is how a psycho talks
I'm cut like that, so why throw salt
I'll beat your ass then step on your glasses, mazel tov
It's not a threat
No it's a promise and you hoes know it's death before dishonor
Oh they sleeping on me now?
Their narcoleptic soul, this tech will blow, they whole set can go pajamas
My think tank is infested with piranhas
Everybody else's dress code is Giuseppe I guess I'll go with Yves-Saint Lauren
I'm the reason why your lady's been displaying odd behavior
She said call her later, why?
Cause I'm inside the broad head like Charles Xavier
Thoroughbred millionaire with a billionaire mind state
Flyin' down to MIA
We at KOD
, 
you throwing singles I'm throwing Stephenson's, Lances
I call them that cause I blow em' in Bron's face
Then leave them on the dancers
Wait til' the lights come on, wave to a light come on
Then leave and go to mansions
But I'ma leave the rich nigga talk to those who put faith in the dollar and hold little grudges
And I'ma move on and blow bigger budgets
Talking in cold while thinking I'm cold, hoes really love it
My old soul trying not to be the sober nigga judging
In retrospect I was a different beast
I switched the wine a few different times trying to slow down like ""Let me sip and see""
Thats not sobriety, thats a called a problem
Thats like being inside a car that caught on fire and all you do is switch your seat
And this is me, take me as I am
Or leave me as you saw me where you liked me last
Believe me that i'm sorry that your sorry ass can't comprehend these bars
Through all these new cars and this viking mask
This is the memory of the 20 year old version of me like my wifey's past
The big fish in the small pond forever trying to calm down my big brothers pisces ass
Telling me about these niggas talking about me and how come I bite my tongue
I said ""Bro these niggas is weak to me""
I rather let them do all their wrong in the dark then have to right my sun
Write my son, that shit is deep to me
Often with writing I be in awe when my thoughts are composed while laying song
If I never would of took that first drink I probably would be playing the Game of Thrones
With Marshall and Hov
 but this ain't no HBO season this is take your ho season
In order to cheat death you gotta either respect me, friend me, or pray for your beating if theres tension between us
And I sense that I'm swinging, I don't wait for no reason, I was raised by Cool J, Cube and Jesus
You was raised by new shades, Fuse, and a pair of shoes made by yeezus
Now beat it before I serve you immorally
I'll show you that theres no correlation between murder and maturity

You life gambling I'm Patrón sippin', signed to Black Label
Champagne wishes become realities
Bad bitches fly minus the travel needs
My dick is the biggest thing on my anatomy
I diss niggas for nothing like why you mad at me?
Nickel is definitely still reckless
The last nigga got killed and made me feel threatened
Who really cares what a rapper talkin'?
The only feeling that ain't familiar is after losses
I shoot Edo G in the head and go back to Boston
With a trunk full of white, we call it Asher Rothin'
Feel honored if I talk about your ass often
You should wanna sleep in the bed I was jacking off in
It's a reason these muthafuckas is backin' off him
He Floyd Mayweather, Paul Williams, and Chad Dawson
All rolled up in one his money trash talkin'
Amongst bosses chillin' out in the cash office
Nigga, you testin' the one, nickel second to none
I'm hotter than Texas at three, I'm affecting the sun
I don't just sound raw
I'll disconnect your shit have you walking around with Bobby Brown jaw
And then Whitney say crack is wack
And it offended me like, Fluzey why you dissin my music?
And you can ask Proof, we come from Chopper City
Minus the wack suit, and the beef with Ness
Forever in hell and the smell of that sweet success
That calico talkin', sayin, ""We the best!""
I'm a fair teaser
This bitch said, ""Who the fuck died and made you God?""
I said ""Jesus.""
I'm in the zone I feel like a star
And nigga you know what to do if you feel like a fraud
Go on jump in that traffic, you playin' Frogger
I ain't no blogger, I'm Mister Rearrange Your Aura
Niggas thinking all I got is internet soldiers
'09 is the fear year, respect's over
The OG's taught me how to do it one way
So I ain't down for no games unless its gun play
Niggas'll murder judges, over murder grudges
I don't put money on heads I just refer to cousins
I drop dope records that's hot like a furnace
The needle on that record player is hypodermic
Receive food from a intravenous tube
Kill your ass in private between me and you
I'm sick enough to go up in your house
Sickening rhymes, I spit 'em and throw up in my mouth
You fuckin' round with the Slaughter House conglomerate
Like catching your parents fucking, I'll leave you traumatized
A beef live till the drama dies
My daughter could get struck by lightning if I ain't down for homicide
You don't believe in me you a atheist thug
My bitch pussy delicious as the Flavor of Love
Fuck what they say
I'll tattoo your face, Danger but it ain't for the love of Ray-J
I got her card hard, I call my penis ""Dicky""
Before I let you bullshit me, I let Serena kick me
And she got thunder thighs
I could just be so heartless and give you the business but I ain't from the Chi
A product of the Borris where Barry Gordy records
I'm talking A.1 Yola, that's totally pure
I flow bodies of water, dead fishermen haunt me
I got the temper of a trigger, the dick of a donkey
I'm a Soulja Boy, yeah I'm the last breathing
No need to turn on my swag, come on, I'm swag sleeping
Ya'll niggas flows is old ya'll sound like last weekend

Rap Genius Intro,The Bar Exam 4,2017.0,"This poetry is thought-provoking and there's thought behind it
And there's great writing in rap as well **Static**
You know you never hear **Static**
Rappers being compared for like the greatest writers of all time
You know you hear Bob Dylan it was, so was Biggie Smalls
You know some of the things that Biggie Wrote

Excuse me, flows just grow through me
Like trees to branches, cliffs to avalanches
It's the praying mantis
Deep like the mind of Farrakhan

Rakim, I mean listen to some of the things he wrote

Classical too intelligent to be radical
Masterful, never irrelevant: mathematical

I mean you take those lyrics and you pull 'em away from the music
And you put 'em up on the wall somewhere
And someone had to look at 'em
They would say ""this is genius!"" Static

Leave the side of your car door with more
Smokin' more holes than the Swiss cheese
Bitch please, I'm postponin' yo' homies
Older moments like I stole his future
Hoes know me, I'm no phony
Females'll tell you, ""Yeah he cute, but he sure'll shoot ya""
My heart bleeds the blood of felonies
The blood of Superman, the blood that I've never seen
You seem like the shook type
You ain't a thug so I wanna see what your brains and your blood look like
Fuck is you sick? 'Pac should be pissed
'Cause fifty percent of them niggas suckin' his dick his bitch
I'm against all this name-callin' shit

What's beef? Beef is when these rappers be believin' they rhymes

Gangsta, ain't this?
Starvin' artist that comes with the guns he paint with
All you sorry street rejects

Houses come down, drastic murders is happenin'
Make a nigga momma mouth come down
The precinct's heated, the cops is mad
Because they know who shot yo' ass
And they know who can beat it
Above the law, run up on y'all
So quickly and show you what only you and a slug saw
The silence is screwed in front of the .9 Ruger
Quietly shootin' what'll hush y'all
I will leave you lying down in a street
Everything around you will be dyin' down but the beef
Please believe - my guns'll take you punks
To your maker from my freezin' sleeve

King of Kings,"Royce da 5'9"" Demo Tape",2002.0,"Lemme school you..

I wake up and I don't know where I am
I wake up and I don't know where I am
I wake up and I

Yo, to all my hungry disciples
Listen, let's talk, sit still, sit still
Sit still, blackout, listen, the hungriest
Kings, kings, kings, sit still
Listen, lemme school you for a minute
Blackout, blackout

An angel from the lost, spike headband, marked dead man
Innermost thoughts locked, dangling from a cross
The hotter the heart, the harder - whether
Crucified with my chest up, felt forsaken by the Father
Wounded rebel in Jerusalem
Gettin picked on, and whipped by the goons of the Devil
Black man, five foot nine, see the dawn when he stares out
With wool hair and feet of bronze
Birdstick, a black staff with brown handle
Backtrack; my first kicks, brown sandals
In the breeze of the surgeon, surrounded by merchants
Immaculate birth, conceived by a virgin
Do a lot in the lyric, due to the true and not living
Pure as the white driven human inside of a spirit
Or the Cathedral, that's only a quarter illegal
Slaughter the people, all for the forces of evil
Exterior armor, transparent, non-vivid
The last grand wizard slash serial bomber
Here it is; I'm Heaven sent, livin in Hell
All-seeing eye, in hand of the pyramids and keep watchin
Out for the death while the beats knockin
Plot by the Devil in a blue dress and cheap stockings
Spiritual last, equipped with physical mass
Able to think quick and bring miracles to pass
The lost wonder of dark days to breathe light in
Christ titan, cough thunder and sneeze lightning
Control the thoughts, po' corps, feed the gators
Sole mediator of code in the Holy War, in front of the mosque
And a storm comin in March
Locked in the physical form of the son of the God

I wake up and I don't know where I am
I wake up and I don't know where I am
I wake up and I

The true and living son of the son, thorough
Tongue sword of war, speak and slash son of a gun
When the rumors started I departed - I don't know
Some old shit about me being placed in a tomb in the Garden
Listen here you lost, I was tortured and died for the cause
And got caught, disappeared from the cross
First into a lesson and learned of my return to the Earth
In the form of a perfect human specimen
The written jeweler, driven from the face of a leader
Slave of the people, in the form of a hidden ruler
Satan's descendents, put a break in what they intended
The hatred is ended - sway the other way of the sentence
Bells'll go and tell, defendants'll go to jail
Hot coal on ya trail, sinners'll go to Hell
I got a soul for sale, well;
Let's start the bidding at a tragic death
Who knows what's finna happen next
Cousin of death, with predictions that I can promise
Gave it to Nostradamus and now he touchin the rest
The heart caller, balancing birds on my finger
Nerves of a cheetah, birthed with the urge to walk water
Foul searchin, bi-weekly, all-purpose
Talk verses in dashikis and fly turbans
Enter the scheme of things, all love
All thugs get judged by me, the king of the kings

I wake up and I don't know where I am
I wake up and I don't know where I am
I wake up and I",https://genius.com/Royce-da-59-king-of-kings-lyrics

Been through the downs
Sharpened the flow
Ginsu'd the sound
I was tossed in the game
Then thrown out
You know you in
When your friends want out
Fans get cocky tryna visualise my pockets
Really y'all should stop it
Quit criticising my topics
They say he rap about dick so much you could predict his lines
But the hits they listening to is all about bricks and shine
And this is fine
Wait, let me pick your mind
Everybody's a rapper now into it to get em signed
Y'all with em fakin' rap
What's the use in speaking how you truly feel
If you gon have to turn around and take it back
Joey taught me don't make your life an open book to them trust me
Cause it will fuck your shit up plus them niggas is touchy
But the race I'm running is against rappers touchier than Rihanna and Kanye in London
Ok I'm done and
I'm guilty for rappin about thuggin' and not about lovin
I'm deeper and darker

I'm a beast when I'm deep in thought
Diss me you reachin, I ether the author
Fly as a bitch leavin the park

Hop up on the spaceship and leave Earth muthafucker

I Ain’t Coming Down,Success Is Certain,2011.0,"I'm floating away without leaving the ground, ground
They asking me what's it like up there? I tell 'em I ain't coming down
I'm tryna stay up and I don't wanna touch down, down
They asking me what's it like up there? I tell 'em I ain't coming down
No no, I ain't coming down, no no, I ain't coming down
No no, I ain't coming down, I ain't coming down

Now that my vision's more clearer
This is for the hate on Royce in Detroit era
I know y'all had a good time but that was your time
But that was your error, now look at you and look at me
Compare us, you can do it easily
This ain't when Royce was looking stupid on that beef DVD? Uh-huh
Shout out my niggas D-Twizzy, I'll admit when I was wrong
I remember thinking and I should probably hit my nigga Von
You talking shit about me at your barbershop? You obviously politicing wrong
Niggas need to stop PMSing
I hope y'all barbers give your ass the same hairline as me and DMX’s
I went from wishing Trick-Trick was gone
For picking which bitch that wishing I could TwitPic my home
And as far my nigga Trick before we was brothers
I think we really just need to get to know each other, I'm off

I'm floating away without leaving the ground, ground
They asking me what's it like up there? I tell 'em I ain't coming down
I'm tryna stay up and I don't wanna touch down, down
They asking me what's it like up there? I tell 'em I ain't coming down
No no, I ain't coming down, no no, I ain't coming down
No no, I ain't coming down, I ain't coming down

I gotta say this shit one time
When have you ever known me to get in the way of one's grind?
Cause even when that dark cloud hovered above me
I went from signed to unsigned, then I found my own sunshine
Now let me say this shit one more time
When have you ever known me to get in the way of your grind?
Can you find one hip hop listener around the globe
Who don't know that Nickel Nine is from Motown?
These cats say, ""He's whack
He ain't even from the D so why he got that D tat?""
Then their friends run to me like my friends
""Saw you cyphering on BET but he ain't like it cause you ain't have no D hat""
Make up your mind you whining niggas
Ryan in business schools to talk, bought shoes for shawties
Bought coats for the kids while you niggas choose to floss
And y'all wanna nail who to the cross? Y'all niggas soft, I'm up

I'm floating away without leaving the ground, ground
They asking me what's it like up there? I tell 'em I ain't coming down

Whoo Kid!

Yeah, I call my cannon ""poppa""
I'm the shit, smell me? You can't mask it
This not the phantom of the opera
The cannibal of rap, knock you out on camera
Turn around and play it back on When Animals Attack
I'm a psycho like no other I am out my shit
The bitch picked up my shot and drank it so I fuckin' shot the bitch
I'm controllin' lots of shit
I can go from rock 'n' roll to opposite
Hip-hop and shit, never miss like Stojaković
Pop up on you, pop you quick, run your pockets, pocket it
Killin' what I'm not feelin', trigger's strung like a violin
Consignment, tell the buyer, ""welcome to my environment""
I'm violent, my rhyme's on fire like dyin' firemen
Thirty-two year-old pioneer
Who'll leave you lyin' if you usin' iron
Where you niggas pink, I am rare
Where they're servin' up the drinks, I am there
Take the cops to water, S.W.A.T. the shore up
Like somebody saw a fly in it
Any thing movin', I want in
Unless it's the skinny-jean movement, I want out
I don't need nobody else to ride for me, I roll out
Before I shoot you say ""'member me?"" You wasn't forgot about
I got a pocket full of stones
My niggas'll be on your head
For some money to stay in the prostitutin' zone
I will let the bully off
Beef with me is like a lock connected to a bra
You be naked, can't pull it off
Imagine murderin' your record company for merging with
Who gave you a deal cause you ain't deserve it
I'm not a rapist, bitch, I'm just a pervert
Crazy dude with a dick full of baby food, now switch to Gerber
Lyrics is murder. Get it and put your gun away
I whip a ""Pacquiao"" when it's Spring, sell it through the Summer
You can call me Money May, your money funny, run away
Take the K off a fake, leave a nigga Dunaway
Get it? I go ballistic on your spirit
That chopper look like somebody put some scissors to your fitted
I've been wit' this from the beginnin'
If you visual picture me killin' witnesses
If I'm the defendent, I was offended
I rap a lot but I'm not independent
Drink alcohol a lot, knowin' my only real problem is spendin'
The metaphors and them similes is career endin'
Your melon's soar to infinite's what I intended
Don't get in trouble, you get me pissed and my fist'll hit ya
You hearin' birds and seein' doubles like picture picture
You hearin' doubles you heard me say I was sicker sicker
I'm gonna go get the papers, get the papers
Your bitch sucked my johnny two times
Polished me like a hella shoe-shine
Get your shine box, Ryan got a goodfella coupon
I fit the description of a killer wit' a ridiculous dick
Why is your bitch so mentally into me? Shit!
But she can miss me with the sensitive, intimate shit
All I do is poke holes like I be fencin' with chicks
Picture black attitude
Before I meet you I'm naturally mad at you
You have to be that into gratitude
If you like livin' life then kiss my ass and you cool
I'm hot like your gun'll be after you pass me the tool
Don't have to be rappin' at your talent show at your school
To have the full capacity of my faculty clappin' at you

Good lord I'm the shit, you niggas know I'm lethal
I'm just wonderin' why you won't admit that I'm nice
What the fuck you niggas tryna do tonight?
Motherfucker I'm nice

I don't need no ovation, MC with no patience
Diddy called me to write it when he needed rotation
Went to his location, wrote it for no pay then
Gave him my CD, while the streets was pulsatin'
I guess my luck passed, yup, cause Puff passed
Puff passed on me like the weed rotatin'
No hatin', 
he must be eatin' way too much cheesecake
If he think he can see an MC from his team take me
That ain't a diss though, it's just so frustratin'
Makes you wanna go and shoot up stations
Smack a DJ I don't like for nothin' basically
If I should die tonight I done been to enough places

Quit ridin' dick, worryin' about Plies and Trick

Violate on Sunday get annihilated Monday (I'm nice)

I leave you bleedin', lyin' on the cuttin' room floor then

But he ain't never fell on, I'm just gonna ignore him
Make a nigga extra famous after I warn him

Or you can have your family do the morning
Nothing can stop us, fly when nothin' can top us

I know I sound high, but I will break you
Do you like a cup at the opera, no thank you

Word! The Bar Exam, I told you how it's goin downDJ Premier ya host, Statik Selektah on the wheels of steel
Royce 5'9"", the artist
Teaching you motherfuckers how to rhyme

I like to say I specialize in rhyming
You recognized in time
I train till I'm in pain
I exercise my mind
I effortlessly write
My weapons with me tonight
So, please be aware of 'em
Walk up in the fight club with eight ounce white gloves and leave with red ones
Mood swing on the beat, soon as Preem prepares one
Pick and choose my punches
Walk away with minimal lumps
Pivoting around the vocal booth in trunks
Back you off me like a boxer
Nigga I overuse the drum
They call me Travis Barker with a chopper
Knock away your tooth
Do the rock-away or I will raise your roof
Rest in peace to Proof
He prolly rolling over in his grave, niggas poisoning his name
The misfortunes of the fortune and the fame
I'm too cocky to hit
5'9"" and Preem, the new Rocky and Mick
The dollar signs go ding
Preem, cut me

Cut!
This is where your heart at bitch
Something you don't wanna battle with
As if you don't notice
Damn I'm great
I don't like no fake niggas
This is where your heart at bitch
Something you don't wanna battle with
Damn I'm great

They say this is a wise old profession
So my flow is my whole confession
I rhyme like applying cold compression
You go away like swelling
When pellets from the throw away is yelling
At you near the doorway to hell or heaven
Set me up, I know you've thought about it
That means I gotta wet you up
And I ain't talking with no water bottle
Sit outside your house creeping
Come out and (ugh)
Spit out your mouth piece
And I'll skid out to South Beach
Fuck yo' talent, I'm never going down
I'm a stand-up guy, yes I'm up for the challenge
Up cause of balance
From tying my shoe strings together when I was young and busting the cannon
Your life is spun, the fight is done
You've been iced out by the nicest one
And I ain't talking about Jacob and Johnny the jeweler
I'm talking bout letting the fakest hear the sound of the Ruger
What you know about that?
I know all about that
Me and Tip feel the same
Seeing tips feel the brain
Is like watching a movie but I ain't make those
I just make the credits roll after I'm Oliver Stone
I'm the pedestal you stand on me I'mma flip you
Pitbull, put your hands on me I'mma sic you
It's true you not so hard, I'm sensing you puss
As soon as you drop your guard, in comes the hook
Preem, cut me

Cut!
This is where your heart at bitch
Something you don't wanna battle with
As if you don't notice
Damn I'm great
I don't like no fake niggas

And my kitchen is huge, we do dishes with dudes
Coldest flow of the summer, I see 'em come and they go
See 'em fumble the flow, it's more goers then comers
Put the piece to ya dome, then you at piece with the chrome
Peel your cap and eat you, and pick my teeth with ya bones
I'm from the city of Gators, haters I dealt with them dudes
If you don't like me then likely I'll make a belt with ya shoes
Put a hole in ya soul, it trickles badder than good

Your blood might give me love, and likely highten my buzz
Your type is simply a bitch, and fightin' with me's a risk
I might empty my clip, if the hype will get me my niche
I'm out in front of ya, guns out
'Bout to knock ya fronts out, boxin' about to drop without Columbia
I spit this venom myself, my independence is felt
Finished with Slim and his help, long as he winnin' I'm good
Long as I'm known as one of the most vicious
MCs spittin' from the ""D"", low and behold the mitten

Never been deep in the streets, I can't be somethin' I'm not

If I was a civilian for a day
I'd take a glance at my daddy ‒ another me

I Promise,Death is Certain,2004.0,"Yeah, yeah yeah
There's a void that needs to be filled inside of this marketplace
You could die in my parkin' space
My mom want me to blow up and house them
My father want me to bring product out without Slim
And prove them wrong, to pay my bills
I'm right on your heels, I'm for real, my shoes is long
To feed my son - I will leave you leakin' in the street
I will heat you to kingdom come, ugh
The king will come
Wait 'til you gone in place of an angel appear to take you home
The beard on the face is gone
These bullets is straight razors, blazin' you, case in point
Amaze the rap game, make 'em point
Walk inside of the house of the illest and case the joint
And take whatever I want out of it
Now that I'm wise, my future rides on it, it's time for triumph

I promise - if you just let me in the game (Pray)
If you should bless me enough to let me reign I will contain you (Pray)
I promise - I will support my family slash crew (Pray)
I promise - I will pray every day, I will ask you
I promise - if you just let me in the game (Pray)
If you should bless me enough to let me reign I will contain you (Pray)
I promise - I will stop the killin', I will change (Pray)
I promise - I will put in this flow what you put in my soul

The whole misconception with me
The only thing people think that I'm arrogant when they don't know me
That's what it was
If I wasn't a real nigga the shit would not bother me but it does
The shit is not fair
Just picture yourself lookin' in the mirror tryna change what is not there
When niggas stop speakin'
Them phone calls get slow, I'm feelin' like Nas before he dropped ""Ether""
I appear to be sober
I'mma really be runnin' over whoever said that my career was over
Whoever gave me the cold shoulder
And turn they backs on me, I'll be blazin' you from both coasts
Believe me, I got Lil' Homie and July 6
So you funny actin' ass producers, I don't need you
You can keep yo' beats, rap for money
Fuck you and everybody else who acted funny

I promise - I will put in this flow what you put in my soul

Uhh, I'm callin' every nigga out in the game
That tried to go against the fire and douse the flame
I could shout yo' name
But nobody stands out more than anybody else, you doubt the same
For every nigga that say I'm hidin'
Just because I ain't hangin' out at the same places I once vibed in
Everybody at my father's job askin' him rumors, shit
Stop 'cause my dad soon gon' quit
If I can, maybe thank him for raising me
To think like a baby gangsta, crazy temper
I paid my sentence - totalled out the prison
The game sent me, fame owes my name plus interest
But once you strapped in to the penmanship
And the track rumbles, you trapped in this rap jungle
When you can't come through, sales or numbers
The one who prevails'll be the one who remains humble

I promise - if you just let me in the game (Pray)
If you should bless me enough to let me reign I will contain you (Pray)
I promise - I will support my family slash crew (Pray)
I promise - I will pray every day, I will ask you

Let’s Grow,Build and Destroy,2000.0,"Real niggas only
First of all, what's my name
Five-Nine
Yeah, I got something for you
I got something for you, yeah

They call me Royce 5-9 or Mr. Always Ice Cold Wristed
Or Mr. None Of Your Business
Mr. Consistant In Conflict, for so dope lyrics
The hardest hitting nigga in show business
Came in this game with a pissy-ass attitude
Arrogant like, shut up
Laughing that you a trick
I wasn't happy before but I'm happy today
I'm rapping today, looking to get a plaque in my day
So I met this White boy one night
Who turned out to be the illest human being I ever heard in my life
He took me under his wing and showed me some things
And molded me into a pro until the flow was mean
Taught me not to do it like this, but to do it like that
Threw me all types of love and I threw it right back
Though we don't talk as much, we never let the game consume us
Cause we too real, my nigga Slim, let's grow

Let us grow up, now we got here
We can't stop here, we too far
All my niggas, y'all my niggas
And you all know who you are

Royce 5-9 or, twelve men in one
About as explosive as them shells in your gun
Mr. Quick To Pull A Thing On You just for your loot
Mr. Mr. Mr. Quick To Swing On You before he shoot
I'm the finest tuned rapping machine rapping a scene
Since, way back when there was only rapping in Queens
Suck my balls if you competing with me homeboy
I don't dream, I'm the type to just be homeboy
Sucka free is like a religion I honor and serve
And more common in words, a song with you, what's in it
Y'all niggas is all punks and your jewels is rented
And your diamonds is all dark, like they blue but tinted
I would never kill none of y'all, I ain't that fool
But I will stomp the shit out you, I ain't that cool
You ain't even gotta greet me when you see, matter of fact
You better give me five feet when you see me, where you at
Let's grow

Let us grow up, now we got here
We can't stop here, we too far
All my niggas, y'all my niggas
And you all know who you are

Royce 5-9 or, one sick nigga
Bitches know that with me that the cum gets quicker
Mr. Always Got Some Cris' Or A Pistol
Rather diss you than chill wit you and will hit you
The insanest monster that came and conquered
A game that remains to be full of trained imposters
I will not let you niggas talk to me, no way
This is not what I'm here for, give me my money
Faggots only attract faggots, and that's that
You rap rat, you fuckin roaches and black maggots
Feelin my heat, I talk shit from the moment I wake up
Turn right around and talk shit in my sleep - let's grow

Let us grow up, now we got here
We can't stop here, we too far

All we know is the beginnin', nobody controls the way that it ends
I got the weight of the world on my shoulders
And one phone call can change it, make it fall 'til I'm all caved in
My homie got shot and it's not looking good for him
No, this is not happening, 
knock on wood for him
Speeding to the hospital crying, asking God, ""Why?""
Imagine, my car moving as fast as my mind
This is not happenin' to me
My homie will not, and I repeat will not flatline on me
How can I explain this vividly to your moms
That this is behind entertainment? She won't get it
All she understands is the boy that she raised just might
Die in a hospital bed fightin' for his life
I'm prayin', standin' over you
Lookin' at you hooked up to a machine, holdin' your hand, sayin'

Don't you go nowhere
Stay here with me
'Cause if you leave me
It hurts so bad

Death is certainly gon' catch you
Whoever special to you will be left hurt
This is the cold, harshness of life
Just when it unfolds, you lucky to grow old, life

They can take me
I'll take your place
'Cause it hurts so bad

You tearin' our team apart
Though time heals all of our wounds, it's still leavin' a mark
I took it too far; the feelin' that's hidden deep in my heart
Comes out when I look at the scar
And I can't kill nobody to get you back
Nigga that's somethin' that time can't heal
While I'm sayin' my grace, I'll be lookin' up at the sky
And tellin' God that he's makin' a mistake
You can't take away one brother and leave the rest of the clique
Lord please, double check your list
And if you get to his name and it's a check beside it
Death comes in threes, take me next
But don't make me sweat, please, I won't make it
I get restless speculatin'
Sons should bury mothers
Every mother don't wanna bury her son, they sayin'

Don't you go nowhere
Stay here with me
'Cause if you leave me
It hurts so bad

Death is certainly gon' catch you
Whoever special to you will be left hurt
This is the cold, harshness of life
Just when it unfolds, you lucky to grow old, life

Just when it unfolds, you lucky to grow old, life

They can take me
I'll take your place
'Cause it hurts so bad

Death is not no option
I'm pullin' money outta my pocket, tryna con the doctor
Please, treat this thug the way you would treat your baby
The way that you would treat yo' blood, I'll pay!
As heavyweight as we are, I know how you medics are
'Cause I be checkin' ER everyday
I know we are a hairful, but doc
This ain't one of them that came through shot
That shoulda been careful
'Cause no dude could bleed; the way his heart pumps
More than any patient that rode through that you seen
The reason that he's my man
'Cause I tell him if he can hear me to squeeze my hand
And he squeezes, so I tell him some things
Don't let them machines help you breathe
Don't leave from receivin'
'Round quarter to eight, his moms is sleepin'
His grip weakens, 
his squiggly lines go straight
Call the doctor, 
""Give him all you got! Shock him!""
He gon' tell you it's too late
Call the doctor, ""Give him all you got! Shock him!""
It's too late

Don't you go nowhere
Stay here with me

It hurts so bad

Royce and Reef, double R, beef is close, but trouble's far
Nickel Nine is what the rhyme is, I put my time in nigga
Nickel Nine is.. me not them, this is.. him not they

He is the reason why the funds is dizzy
Money continuously spinning, round and around like a frisbee
My lungs is sticky from, the second hand smoke
From out of the guns; he shoots a lot, they busy.. come get me
He is, quick on the draw, same nine that I used
When you thought I copped it and popped it at the same time, shit
Carry tools, you gotta, the streets is overpopulated
With niggas who cheat, like Andrew Guilota
Royce and Reef, double R, when the gutterest beats
Meet with the troubled bars, nothin but heat
Niggas I'm in and outta this booth, like Clark Kent for the youth
Flying with the NARC-proof tent for the truth
Niggas be tripping a lot, so I keep the longest clip in the lot
Hit you while you loading the clip in the Glock like bloaw!
No life, no rep, the only games I play is Umi Says like Mos Def


He is over-protected, keep the coldest connections
When it goes in effect the only thing froze is the necklace
That's it, keep the gat by me, I'm not rowdy
So none of you's can see me like Jack Ponti
None of you niggas bad as me
I got a Mobb and we Deep like Hav' and P, so get a job
My shoes is 9 and a half sizes too big
For every thug nigga listening and nodding his head
You better know that he is, a motherfuckin' throwback
Rap shit nowadays is so wack, I wish I could go back
Shit is undone, so I spent money like
It's more from where it came, even more where dick come from
The time it took to write this, I could be selling twice this
And wipe shit, like my vemonmous drive is priceless
My goons they'll put you away
And if it's heat, then it's no beef, homie I'll cook you today


I got niggas like ""That's Eminem's man, ain't it?""
Like that's my name, like I changed it when my man became famous
By the way, you ain't beefin with Slim, you beefin with us
So stay out the magazines, keep it shh hush, okay?
This mothafuckin' rapper is hilarious, dog
Never to big for that box, cause the area's small
And you'll fit, six feet deep is where you'll sit
Bring it true, I'll turn sixteen deep into a trip to the sky

Yeah, you don't wanna hover, ya mommy wouldn't like it

I got a lot of friends, none as loyal as him
I give a lot of love, none as spoiled as him
The one friend you always wanna be nice to
Besides, you kept me out of trouble in high school
Close and distant and hard in most positions
He knows, and listens and needs no description
Hangin' with two nuts that can always depend
On each other when one them's feelin' used up
Born at the same time in the same place
Twins wit the same mom, but not the
Same face
Fatigues from the same game, we gotta equally maintain
We feed from the same brain
We grew together and I considered you all mine

A family jewel, too priceless to count him out
The power to keep you grinnin', a thug mentality like me
'Cept he only beats wit women
I need him for the health, I guess I'm a bit abusive
I choke him up and beat him when he's thinkin' for himself
Somethin' I really don' love doin, cuz I feel guilty and try to make it up to him
My (Friend!), down for him, he's down for me
And even when he's runnin' his mouth, you hear sounds from me
I speak for the two of us everyday
What's mines is his, we share everyday
And if you wearin' lipstick, wear the same stick
You look like a rainbow whenever you change it
The power to beg and always were a hat
And a raincoat when it's damp and shower's ahead
He adores me, that's all it was
That's why he do things without me, like fall in love
The Game is ready to test the sharks
But he's too vicious, that's why he never left my heart
It's too late he grown now
The two of them probably wouldn't even get along now
Cuz of the time, ladies wanna get it on now, cuz of the rhyme
And we can take 'em, one at a time, in front of the line
I can rub it in his face, he'll never rub it in mines

Stick up! I got the gats out grindin'
Give me any kinda Preem track, I rap out rhymin'
And brrrrp! Switch up, turn 'round and rap 'bout diamonds
Tell the underground, I'm shinin', I'll be back, I promise
What you lookin' at, dog? Your boy is fire
The more time goes by, his nose gets higher
Plus, he been pushin' that raw, he knows what he wants
To fuck a Pussycat Doll before he retires
It's all about black and white, it's like a piano
The white and black cards you dealt, life is a gamble
You might rap hard today, like you a animal
Then suddenly, tomorrow, you gay, like The Sopranos
I done seen it all, lyrical niggas who dumb it...
Down, for y'all niggas to sing along and still do nothin'
You simple like the ABC's, is y'all countin'?
You like the caption at the bottom with the ball bouncin'

Five-nine, crystal clear, pistol in here
You disappear as soon as I shoot it, if you appear
You see it clear if I appear to be clutchin' a shottie
The butt on the gun is bigger than Buffy the Body's
I go upside your head with it and fuck up the party
Oooh, I make your ass lose those couple Bacardis
The forty-long came along with a couple of bodies
I know a couple Corleones, a couple of Gottis
My story long, nigga, I stay deep in the drama
I get my Maury on, nigga, and sleep with ya mama
I done did wifes, did dimes, did niggas in when they tripped
'Cause they found out the kids mines
Blew the Tech off, drew the column up on who the best
Put himself, Nas, Jay on it and moved the rest off
I'm a gangsta, as well as a star
Put 'em together and you catch me pickin' up where Guru left off

Five-nine, stand back, he about to blow

Can’t Tell Me Nothing Freestyle,UnKnown,UnKnown,"I had a dream I could buy my way to heaven
Roll dice and put that on a seven
I told god I'll be back in a second
Man it's so hard not to act reckless
Hip hop's alive I ain't feelin' it
Look me in my eyes and tell me I ain't killin' it
Man how could I be the villain
When I turn right around and revive what I'm killin'
So when I rhyme niggas feel it
No more beef I had to throw mine in the skillet
Just ask Nas who he feelin'
Macgyver's mind I got supplies on the ceiling
That's when I heard a friend say, life is but a hyphen
Bottled up inbetween that begin and end date
Scribbled on that tombstone, nigga you'll be soon gone
Nigga's will just move on, I see behind your days
I thought all I had to do was pull the pen out and blow the fuck up
Didn't know they were squeezing my grenade
The politics is out of it Nickle out of jail
Now nigga's start apologin', acknowledgin' 
Solomon
Jesus, hotter than a fever
Nigga shot at me guarantee I got even as a season
Nigga this is D's up, with the red and green cuffs
Gucci on the boy, boy nigga you ain't seen plush
We did the suicide doors
You're trying to do the villa with the suicide floors
It's like I'm who decides war
A coward dies a thousand times you should die more
Six million ways you can get it when you diss me in them lyrics
Nigga you decide yours
I'm in the house by the beaches
I never look inside a mans mouth while he eatin'
I know the south's trying to keep it
The game is to be sold without tryna lease it
Without sounding preachish
Y'all doing y'all dirt and y'all trying to sweep it
Under your monies a tall sign of weakness
Y'all signing don't make your hard body y'all hymen
Labia made glittery glittery shells
Jewel's are the forbidden fruit when the bitter rebels
I never seen a dead hand inside a purse
I never seen an armored car that follows a hearse
Imagine if the game died and we got it a shirt
Good more is good more and russle the side of it's worse for
Unto whom, so ever much is given of him shall be much required 'til his luck expires
Nah I ain't a prophet but I'm happy you asked me
From shackled to my past to freedom, make way the profits
That's why you find me in the latest outfit
While it's childish, grown ups try to find a way to stop it
Cause once the Cournel get it on and poppin'
I spit coke the eight ball's in the corner pocket
I'm a monster like Swizz is, y'all full of shit like my clip is
Round up to slap or shock a nigga like T.I.P did
But no apologies for shit did cause y'all too wound up
I'll go against a nigga cause the wind blow
Keep that hole between your ears and your chin closed
Po boy bow to a dope boy, Five-Nine bottom line y'all are not a inch mo'
Groupie couldn't walk a mile in these Gucci's
Couldn't sniff the in sole stick to king Cole
Your very being is a journal
Your that flow in this rap show of the eternal

La, la, la la
Niggas can't take our money home
La, la, la la
So we spend it's like nothing, right

Gettin’ Money Freestyle,The Bar Exam 2,2008.0,"Intro:
Please be clear. This is a fuckin' invasion. Royce Da 5'9""
Verse One:
I'm gettin' money like a motherfucka
I do the dollar like the Yao stretch
Casino chips that Denale bet
Ain't spazzin' at the house party
Mink draggin'/dragon like Bilal breath
Dead prez ran a train on the green lady
That green lady turned around and had a dream baby
That dream baby was I
That green lady was ma
Follow me honey, it sound funny
I'm money
Get it?
Niggas is idiots so probably not
I Murder Inc., let Ashanti & Irv Gotti watch
A walkin' mollie wop
Tell your whole fellat to cock off
Drop the jeans
And pull out a foot like when you take a sock off
I ain't attached to no tooley
I'm quite screwy
I just take the Lock off
Pop it and Drop It like Huey
Weed avenue, bread rollin' on Phillie Street
Triggers get used more than Wayne +A Milli+ beat
So don't make me laugh
You think with your class
I think with my math
Not with my dick, I speak on his behalf
Anyone of you motherfuckin' NASCAR tunnel crews
I call you that, cause you fixin' to crash
The word in the hood is I got the bag in the streets
Pull the rig up
Take a load off, like I'm havin' a seat
This black coup is V-12 as far as year
I'm been rappin', reppin' the D-12, ask Proof
As far as tears
My face ain't big enough to relate
How many bodies gone in the form of a tattoo
Alcoholic, my kidney color is black blue
Forever fuck with that Remy, love it like Papoose
Wearin' that XXL mag or in The Source
Being the King of the magazines and in a Porsche
My release date is more important to the country than
Tunin' into your news stations November 4th (Obama!)
I turn niggas into veggies and get my lettuce straight
It's like you niggas addicted to bitch shit, you fetish fake
Dahlmer
Pop you, then eat you on the anniversary of your death
Like the top of a wedding cake
Two timer
Yeah, I keep a bitch on the side
I'm Mr. Warn-a-guy
You Mr. Wanna Die
The Bar Exam 2 comma
More polished than
Ray Robinson in his prime
The shoe shiner
He kill 'em with his persistence
Sendin' niggas to hit 'em is a silly mission
Like he's one of Diddy's assistants
Look in my trunk and find a pair of legs inside of some gym shoes
Hangin' out a trash bag and in fumes
I spit whole winters and then June
Show up to your video while you performin'
And shoot you like Ben Boom
You might have dealt with the tools
But you ain't swam with them sharks
Nickel Mike Phelps in the pool
You might pull triggers but you don't pull them like me
Bullets runnin' through shit like the bullets got feet
I'm gonna keep goin' and goin' like a Energizer
Inside a flyin' bullet until the day a bullet stops me
Fuck a bitch, I'm it nigga, I'm a don
I'm a reaper, I'm Cancer, like I'm a sign
Immaculately conceived
Product of dollar signs
The only father of mines
Is Father Time
Chorus:
I'm gettin' money like a motherfucker
You ain't got nothin' on me
I'm gettin' money like a motherfucker
Fuck this auto tune shit
That shit sound weak as a bitch

I exist in you, I'm with you give your senses a call
I have no sense of humor, I vent, you must
Stay the fuck out of my way, I'm too much
I'm the first to let you know if something is real
I come right before the humph or the squeal, I'm something you feel
Go ahead, try to fight with me nigga, do the best that you do
I could be hard, I could be soft, I'll even let you choose
I exist upon the impact of a flying fist
Always show up unannounced on you nigga, I'm kinda sick
What that nigga shoot that gun at me for?
You still alive, I'm a riot not numb anymore nigga now die
I command fear, so be afraid, be very afraid
If you get carried away, then I'mma see you
Nigga you better keep the heater with you, I'm waiting for you, dog
Cause there's somebody that wanna see me with you
Keep an attitude, I'm evil,
 spiteful
Stay mad at you mothafuckin' practical people
Trust the one you love and I'mma make you cry
You even try to fight drugs and I'mma take it's side
The only thing that stronger than me is time
And yours is limited,
 and I'm involved in it 'til you all finished
I despise you, that's why I surprise you
Even if your mother dies I'mma fucking remind you
I want you walking in front of a truck or a car
Cause I hangs out at these hospitals like a club or a bar
If you afraid, be, cause I'm so hard
Only one who can stop me is your God that made me
So, he is your witness, I am your sickness
I got every human being alive on my hit list
I'm still in your way, I'm still under your skin
You don't want me but you would give me away? Fuck you!
Niggas better know that I'm something they'll never know
All you'll ever know is that hurt in his name

Nigga I'm pain, (I'm comin' for you)
You know that I will hurt you
You know I'll rise to hurt you, and you know I'll be back soon
Nigga I'm pain, yeah, I hope you like the name (I'm comin' for you)
No need to fight the pain, cause he will strike again
Nigga I'm pain, (I'm comin' for you)
You know that I will hurt you
You know I'll rise to hurt you, and you know I'll be back soon

Murder,Street Hop,2009.0,"I got a phone call
Six in the morning, anonymous, that said
""Yeah nigga, we got him"" and then they hung up
Then I looked down at my iPhone
At the private number saying ""Who the fuck is this"" to the dial tone
I said fuck it, the next second my phone buzzes
My nigga's wife said nigga's just ran up on cousin
What niggas? She said it was some rappers from Ohio
That been out here known for banana bone thugging
Ran up on him and did what then?
She said they stomped him at the club then pandemonium erupted
(Murder)

Going through my mind, is she telling me shots was fired
Them Ohio nigga's is rock supplying
Heated, stop answering, start spending them niggas calls
Every time he went to see him he went in them rented cars
So it was even harder to find him so they figured
They'd go to the D tomorrow and surprise him
Did they kill him? ""Nah, they only shot a couple times
Heard they was hitting walls."" The nerve of these niggas' balls
Who was he with? ""He was with Tre""
He in the hospital too? ""Nah."" Needless to say, call you back
I called up Tre, Tre answered, I said
Hey man, keep it real fam, why the fuck you still standing?
He said, ""Nickel I'm a killer, not a fighter
So I got up out the way because my weight's a lot lighter
Them niggas was big so I slid but I promise on my kids
We can get them, I know where them niggas is""
Where them niggas at then? I heard what their crew do
Real niggas, if y'all was in my shoes what would you do?

You going murder

Jumped up, pumped up, feeling like Manson Malvo Groucho
My bitch staring out me, I'm out though
I ain't visting cuz in the hospital
Till I got at least one of them nigga's chain in my hand like Alpo
Car headed to where Tre at
Eject the BI to put in T.I., skip to (ASAP)
He off of the freeway in the projects
I hit the exit without blinking to thinking in the process
Tre come running out with a fully on some hot shit
I'm like weapons ain't a thing, killing is the object
What was you doing when they was kicking all on my fam?
He said, ""Nickel, we about to get them niggas, goddamn
Why you got to be so obnoxious?""
What? Just tell me where them niggas at before I take your ass hostage
He said ""Alright. Around six around five
Of them niggas was riding around here in a maroon Crown Vic""
I said alright, pulled out of the lot and made right
You in the car that fit the description, say goodnight
You got to pay the price
Tre said, ""There they go in the alley
Sitting in the car they probably blazing right
And they can't see us cause we behind them""
This ain't the time
""But what if this our only opportunity to find them""
I said you right, pulled into the alley and seen two people in front of them niggas' car taking out garbage
I said wait till these people finish, they innocent
Soon as they go back in their cribs we going to finish it
No sooner than a second after
Tre jumps out of the passenger side blasting
Past them niggas we here to kill, hitting them innocent bystanders
Tearing their trash up
Our enemies jumped out of their car waving badges
They all shooting at me, nobody blazing at him
This ain't adding up
Car in reverse, now I'm mashing, leaving Tre behind
Even though it's some questions that I got to ask him

Murder

Burning rubber away from there in a bullet riddled car
Trying to piece this shit together, hitting the boulevard
If them niggas is the police, what the fuck is Tre?
He ain't dead or in jail by now then he the other way
Snitch or pig, I got to talk to my cousin
That nigga setting me up then I'm a lift his lid
That nigga know how hostile my reactions
I call and try to find out what hospital he at then
Every nigga pickup just laugh when I ask
Have you heard about cuz getting smashed maybe I'm the ass then
Head hurting like a motherfucker, looking for a gas station
Now a nigga need a fucking aspirin
I hear a familiar ringtone from my phone
It's my bitch texting me telling me don't come home
I'm thinking damn should I text back, why me
My phone starts ringing it's Tre on the ID
He said, ""Them niggas tried to get me but I slid""
He want to tell me in person, meet me at my crib
I said nigga please
I threw the phone out the window rolled over it crushed it into a million pieces
I hit the blinker quick then hit the highway
If I'm a be a target y'all know I'm a do it my way
After I rolled for a few hours I'd say
I was tired after I got out of the tri-state
Can't help but feel like another lame exposed

This be the realest shit I ever wrote
Yeah, up in the studio gettin blowed
Truest shit I ever spoke

How can I go from rockin with Dre to fallin out
With Shady to poppin' my Glock on the block to droppin on Koch!
Mistakes that I've made, I've learned to regret
Impatiently we blazin them AK's, to earn the respect
I done been in the trenches for years, in this rap shit
Where my name is mentioned is fear, compared to that shit
I done paid my dues, I done learned more from my mistakes
Then I done learned in any grade in my school
I could have made you today, I could raise ya brow
On a label that's foul or on a Major with radio play
I can guide myself, through the game myself
Give you the chills, kill hip hop and save myself
I learned to behave myself, people choose sides when
They figure you die, I learned they take away my wealth
All these niggas that used to page me, everyday that I dealt
But they all gone, y'all wrong, I page myself, because

I do this music for me, I take time and put pride in it
This music is me, it's no ruinin' me
I'm the truest MC, as hot as you need me to be, as cool as can be
If you was true as me, then this for you, but I do it for I
I do this music for me, I take time and put pride in it
This music is me, it's no ruinin me
I'm the truest MC, as hot as you need me to be, as cool as can be
If you was true as me, then this for you, but I do it for me

Every breath that I breathe, every second I have
To be in the lab, with young man, makin' a track at least
In the basement, rappin in peace, patiently waiting
To blow up and grow up, back and away from this rappin beef shit
All of that should cease, cause I feel like quittin
Back to the factory, rap for ME, when I feel like spittin
Go out and kill a clown a day, don't call me Royce no more
It's Ryan, I just threw Detroit's crown away!
It's only so many times, I could let my temper get tested
I can't handle it, I'll eventually get arrested
I'm on the verge of doin some things, that won't help - shit!
Take myself away from my family, is so selfish
I can't help shit, lately I been ignorin rules
You takin care of too many people, to go and lose
(I) do my music and speak truly, without the influence of movies
Or these fools in the streets that wanna do me, nigga

I do this music for me, I take time and put pride in it
This music is me, it's no ruinin' me
I'm the truest MC, as hot as you need me to be, as cool as can be
If you was true as me, then this for you, but I do it for I
I do this music for me, I take time and put pride in it
This music is me, it's no ruinin me
I'm the truest MC, as hot as you need me to be, as cool as can be
If you was true as me, then this for you, but I do it for me

As you wanna, professional as you wanna
It's gonna still get gangsta cause you fresh out
Go ask, I take your baby mama shopping
No she ain't worth 50 cents just to get at your ass
I'm so petty, any beef I'm so ready
Now you trying kick it like you trying to go steady
Trying to build a motherfucking relationship
Niggas dissing and kissing and making up, I hate that shit


Oh, Royce, you know what's fucked up?
Now we gotta make offers that these bitch ass niggas can't refuse
See, these niggas think they can buy respect
They never even earned respect
They never learned respect
So from here on out, Detroit is officially a no fly zone
You heard it, all these bitch ass niggas
Don't come to this motherfucker without permission
Please don't make me have to demonstrate

""He murdered sometimes months apart, years apart
He used different methods
He would go so far as to plan in his crime the actual deceit of law enforcement
He would murder someone
Cut their body, wrap them in layer after layer of plastic bags and material
Then deposit the body many, many miles from the murder scene.""
I'm a lyrical hitman
I'm a lyrical hitman

This the homicide, sodomy of course
Mobb Deep, like I got Havoc and Prodigy support
Ima' be dope until they find me as a corpse
You can roll your weed up in my Toxicology Report
You can call me Kuklinsky, Iceman for short
And I got dead rapper's pens in my Icebox
After they act hard I lyrically kill 'em then I bury their notebooks in my backyard
Check it out, the lead gonna hit 'em
I'm so far from positive
Nigga I'm the opposite of Rev Run on Twitter
I'm a dead wrong, headstrong spitter
Compared to me you a faggot gettin' fed bone nigga
I'm pitch black!
You a red bone nigga, I'm a trip
You're headphone on, I'm sick
You a snitch, that like to sing the Fed's songs, nigga?

Put the needle in his big ego, watch his head pop
You little niggas done fizzled out

Ima' show them what this about
I am doing work, you can't travel here, pick a different route
Gimme twenty beats and I pick 'em off as you pick 'em out
My shit is the screen, I'm clicking this heat
I hit up your peeps, whip up ya' beef

You show off
Verse one

I've been a monster bitch
My shit been bonkers
The flow been conquered
Hoes I been pompous (Smash Squad)
I've been conceited but I don't run with 5-0
I haven't been shot up either and I ain't from Chicago
When I enter the center stage the show's over
Minutes later the floor is frozen, a Rolls, rolls up
I'm demonstratin' a coke flow but I'm so sober
The original +Renegade+ before Hova
They like, ""Damn, why ain't Dre ever get him?
He seem like so much anger and pain represent him.""
Eminem himself will tell you I'm the only nigga livin'
That done ever spanked him on the same record with him
Your man's gettin' jealous
Cause what I'm spittin' is sicker than his single
He got to think of a dance just to sell it
This is street hop to the fullest
To them real niggas out there on the corner beat boxin' with bullets
Niggas that be trigger packin'
Pop lockin' with Glocks
Could aim well enough to shoot the zippers off your Thriller jacket
Me, I'm the illest rapper
Since every rapper killin'
From here on out, you can call me Shottie The Killer Capper
These record labels just manufacture shit
Like the pimp game homie, I'm here to snatch yo bitch
Got a fist game on me that ain't an afro pick
Try that ying yang on me, I'll handy cap you quick

Verse two

Usually I play the two or three I been ballin'
Bitch, losin' me is like the Piston's losin' Ben Wallace
I'm to Detroit like what Souljah Slim is to Chopper City
So losin' me is like musically losin' Pac or Biggie
I'll be your ass, leave you with your mouth piece wired
Losin' pounds in the hospital, be quiet
Til you finally come up out that coma, boney
Lookin' like somebody put you on the South Beach Diet
If you hearin' me spit it, it's soundin' like the king died
Trippin' when I kick it, it's soundin' like my strings tied
I put the clip in and pull it
And woof
Woof
Listen, the pistol is soundin' like Hakeem's bride
And you don't wanna beef nigga cause my arm's be
All through Cali and Miami like a palm tree
My crew be
In New York or New Jerz usually
With tools to recognize you as who is you?
Excuse me
You don't wanna fool with the etiquette or the Uzi
I'll put you in the credits that's at the end of the movie
I pity your mother
She never seen you in a magazine
For the obituary I give you the cover
(Smash squad)
So when I'm rhymin' with ya
I'm Ving Rhames of the pimp game
I play the same role as Tiny Lister
Again and again
The Debo of the type cast
When I TiVo the mag they be showin' the white flag
So sit at the table and get it like it's digital cable
I torture you into talkin' to me till it get's fatal
Fuck with you till I put you out of your misery
With a silence or I'mma just muffle it up with a potato

Wait, your tummy hurts (Oh), you feelin' better
You can blow, like the Neptunes, after the Jigga record
Me and my nigga Tre can tag team you
Grab our two-ways and both beam you
We can take you out, but your friends talkin' for ya
Oh, I'm sorry, you hungry, we got some sausage for ya

What I Know,Death is Certain,2004.0,"Unlock ya locks, and keep ya keys
The Pac in me got me thinkin' deeply
I got to shock MCs wit 
my philosophies
'Cause I think very deeply
Where I come from where you sweat ya pen up
Young gun rep-resenter from the Ep-icenter
The microphone fienin' for a microphone
Before he knew what a microphone mean
With them four pounds, and they soundin' in off
And them slugs, get them thugs, and the ground, get the chalk
Niggas hearts is dissolvin', involved in
What Farakhan and Jim Brown couldn't solve

I'mma tell you what I know, what I know

'Cause the boys in the hood is always hard
You come talkin' that trash they'll pull ya card
Who would have known that the boy growin' up playin' them cards
Will soon know the music he wrote, it was so true
Who could raise me after I been amazed by Dre
And N.W.A., and you couldn't pay me
To back the staff for free, I will believe
It ain't nothing Shady in the Aftermath
Perhaps when you unwrappin' the plastic
You respect whatever you hear, and the styles is growin'
Them guys is clonin' them pioneers
Rappers wanna be classic like they Clef, Pras, and Lauryn

I'mma tell you what I know, what I know

Elvis was a hero to most
But he never meant shit to me,
 
it's statements
Like that made me gauge, White, Black, hate to make
Me say - I like when they fight back,
 they
Meaning rap, I vent myself
Leanin' back, not knowin' that I meant myself
A lesson comin' fast, you dudes better catch it
Whenever the future answers your questions from the past
And hold that, I'm spillin' these cold raps
'Cause I am a throwback you feeling a soldier
And keep tryin' to keep up with the kind of guy
That'll play you until they fatally say that the game's over

I'mma tell you what I know, what I know

Oh my God, I destroy cities like the Blob
Goin' from city to city, seein' who I could rob
Goin' from makin' them poems up in my garage
Then goin' on major tours with me and my squad
Goin' from listenin' to Reggie to meeting him
With my palms sweaty 
to him, telling me I'm deadly
Goin' from likin' to spray the club after a night
That didn't go my way to plug to writin' for Dre
You damn right I was raised the amazin'
Hand-writin' on the same page that you can't type on
So I black out the usual same way
The old fashion rap 'til it's no lights on

Detroit D tattooed on they hand, that's how we do, niggas'll die for this shit. Time to play, check it out

Ayo, sit back, smoke, the joke is over, you woke
This is pure provoked ""Murder"", it's over ""She Wrote""
I don't know how niggas manage to sleep
Wake up! The clock radio done panicked the streets
Say somethin! I been waiting now hand me these beats
I'm simply a branch of the Slim Shady family tree
That'll snap, D12 first in line of the wrath, I came last
Bout to put my size nine and a half, in the game's ass
Once I hit the booth I swooped on niggas like ""Whoosh""
Two-bit niggas, coupes, and figures we rule
I been vicious, just listen from one track to the next
I was gangsta when rap was nothin but the hats with the X
I sat and watched album for album, niggas flop
Niggas went from pro-black to Italian, I was hot
I worked my fucking ass off, hopin to blast off
Now I'mma let y'all see me, like when Ghost took his mask off
Give you more run for ya ones, packin a full clip
Rapper niggas come witcha guns, don't bullshit
I'mma only give you wild shit, rap with a mild pitch
Only clever with that occasional style switch
Y'all niggas play around on the mic, that's why I'm 'bout to lay it down
Savor they way that you sounding tonight
Because, I listen to y'all niggas records on Fool's Day
Now crack open and bump my shit, it's Tuesday!

Royal Flush Freestyle,The Bar Exam 2,2008.0,"[Intro: Canibus & 
Royce Da 5'9""
]
Yeah
Bar Exam 2, nigga
It's a motherfuckin' holiday, bitches
Bar Exam 2

I landslide you to the lava below, gotta stance nigga flow
How many bars? How far can you go?
Only as far as the mind, Canibus and Royce 5'9""
Bar Exam 2, spit a rhyme
A miniature version of me told me he wanted to MC
I told him, ""Be careful who you be.""
He said, ""I'ma just be me."" I said, ""Yeah, I see
But you don't understand what I really mean""
Look at the manifest list, it got my name down
A bald head for the cool crown, how you like me now?
I terrorize rap music
What manner of creature could do this? Canibus, stupid
Retarded, autistic artists, one click, perfects target
Staff Sergeant Canibus talkin', I would not let off the gas
Traverse it through San Stone's past
The Ripper spills whiskey from a flask

Yeah, I toke green, blowin' out smoke screens
Poke queens, leave them with soaked jeans
You're the definition of what ""joke"" mean
I'm star status, like glowin' lights throughout the far strato-
Sphere, it's clear who repertoire that is
Pursue whites and fuck a shoe price, my cheese outgrew mice
I'm too nice, cut through slice, I'm seein' you twice
The lead pacer, been makin' moves like Speed Racer
Indeed tracin' a line that fucks with your mind like a weed lacer
Try and boast, ain't lyin' close, so what I diagnose
I could fry and roast any guy till they applyin' ghost
Pee on peons beyond eons
Till there's neon Klingons, close encounter of the three kinds
You may fall, I'm AWOL, my heaters will spray y'all
And put you in a hole like Robert Peter to pay Paul
I could give a fuck, got a flow to leave a river stuck
You hear deeper lines, keep a nine near the liver tucked

Yeah, Osama McCain, you climb in this ring
Rhyming with Obama the king
End up on the bottom of the things
Living inside of ominous springs, I'm in a dream
I spit the only kind of sickness that vomiting brings
That means I'm ill/sick, and plus I'm real, bitch
I should've played Hancock instead of Will Smith
'Cause I'm drunk, the flyer, I'm the super hero
Minus all the chump attire, and I bleed hardly
Tell your idol his times up and he's barbe-
Cue, every rhyme lined up like Steve Harvey's do
From the pies to the brick man
Niggas couldn't follow in my steps 'less I died in some quicksand
So come and see a nigga burn a show and give me a hand
Before I give you the fist like a germaphobe
And you probably too scary to scuffle
If you ain't hit a nigga until you buried your knuckles
I got a hundred round drum, I shoot the first thirty
To kill everybody that trash your hook up
Category blast the butcher, empty the clip
Just to make that 70 show like Ashton Lutcher
Nigga you at war with sharks, the government team
Will leave you airless like Jordan Sparks or a motherless queen
We put it on y'all, tape a nigga phone call
Sell it to the net for a phone card
Then use it to phone y'all mommas, I throw you niggas a bone
And then I bury the drama in a bone yard
The flow's in prime, I got more plastic on me
Than all of Hugh Hefner's hoes combined
My niggas got GTs and shit, yeah, I know mini Coopers
While you niggas rolling around in them Mini Coopers
I'm the shit, for real, y'all niggas mini-poopers
Drunk, wildin, commiting vodka and Henny bloopers
Who could give a nigga the Snoop foot?
Stretch him out on the floor like the Manut look
You shook, nigga, I'm like the crew cook
I put a price on the whip, and I'm like the blue book
With an appetite for destruction with the greed stigma
Explains my past and adds to my enigma

Gone (Return of Malcolm),The Bar Exam,2007.0,"This shit right here is called The Return Of Malcolm
Don't take it too personal. Listen close

I feel like I'm at the height of my jump while y'all pivotin'
While y'all visitin' I'm livin' here, ball in a year
The hundreds and fifties in cheeseburgers
The twenties is balled up
You lookin' for singles they all in the air
The hundreds of bitches that we murdered
We ain't literally speakin'
We just team up and we squirt all up in they hair
Give us some coke and a promise
Give us some nut in the throat
She suck till she spittin' up coconut vomit
Get it?
Pardon me miss
I'm just fed up with the way the system is set up
The shit that they had me livin' in prison was better
Rhymin' perfection
Is it a set up?
To give me a year in the county around the time of election?
Or should I just shut up?
Zip it or kick it?
Try to get you to picture the vision
Lyrically, this is my petition to picket
Free me or, eventually see me
The heat in my belt hangs an inch from my pee pee like a key to my cell
To censor me is to censor my CD which inspires me
To spit what will eventually be the key to myself
Times is changin'
Everybody's Gods the same
But they minds ain't
So I talk about they kind is dangerous
Blacks against Affirmative Action sounds as insane
As the war in Iraq while Saddam is hangin'
A dead man's a dead man
Ain't two of a kind
You can't break me
I'm head standin' doin' my time
It's nothin'
My crew bakin' my bread while I'm jail
Had niggas buffin' my boots and makin' my bed
Time will tell who down to bail
If you gettin' down and how wild your arms will flail
When I bomb I unwind like I'm a spawn from hell
The only shots you takin' are those that evolve from shells
(The following name has been edited to keep the peace)
Something is on your mind then nigga say it
You scared?
If I was tryin' to X you out then you know you'd be dead
You need beef with me like you need a hole in your head
You little Stone Throwers
You signed-to-a-label-ass-niggas ain't sayin' shit till you own yours
Whenever them triggers is buckin'
I got to write a label to Trojan requestin' them niggas to up it
Cause my dick get bigger
My balls get larger
To a size that my drawers can't swallow
For y'all it suicide
The verbal amphetamine
The quotes is cold places, inserted with Ketamine
Spoken, they pulsate
Earthquake
Houston we got a problem
I'm settin' your turf straight
Your troops I private piles 'em up
The holocaust (cost) you pay is Hitler's
Way
You dis me, and get merked for Christmas
But the curse if gift less
I'm the first to spit shit
From a podium
Go to your local church to get this
Y'all sell chickens I only serve the biscuit
Leave your blood on the street
You get curbed with blisters
Chicken noodle soup your brains, let it rain
And I clear it out
All the vets say I'm official
And you can ask Diddy
But now that I'm doing time like Shyne
Nigga I'll probably +Press Play+ on a pistol
Political prisoner
Got ammo around my torso like Rambo
Banana around my waist like I'mma gorilla
It's time to apply my pace now on the fo' rilla
Bandanna around my face like dead prez

Statik Selektah

Take a breather
You are now ridin' with a flow the fliest
Selassie inside
Who Jesus chose
Who Hov inspires
Extreme formula in this chess game
Accept change
You the king
We the queen corner a
Best thing spittin' since a geyser
The methane rhythm, it's supplier
Written with the fire
Doused by the best team
With him when he ridin'
Out
Cause the check flame when it get divided
Bout
Niggas livin' through decisions
Learnin' ain't givin' you the business
Quittin' is a privilege
Suited at a funeral, killin' any witness
Over dead prez's
I'm here to view the digits
Clearin' out the air space
Pointin' out who ain't dead
Gods gift to this world
I'm going out with reindeer
Comin' back and bang ya
Leap Year is a thang of the past
When I return and spring from my ashes
Like a deranged angel
Who came cause you asked
But I ain't here to save you, I came for your ass
It's sorta like the reaper
Blowin' at your concert
We write through the speakers
Knowin' that it's God's work
Rap is a prison that'll trap you in freedom
The contradiction of your past
The after you see Him
I don't have to proceed with no master's degree
To change the art
I came and waxed the museum
I saw, I conquered
I paused my disc to do a bid
So y'all can spit bout how you do it big
Nigga is you grown or you a kid?
You trash
And don't make me blast
And turn your dome into a lid
Open your mind
Put led in your brain
You dope for your time
I'm ahead of your game
The door's open
And I'm in it
I'm so focused
You still focusin'
And when I'm finished you gonna be hopin' it still opens
Maybe I lucked up?
Either I'm straight crazy or slavery got a nigga fucked up
Eminem and Kramer
The minimum will blame 'em
The average nigga got the word spinnin' in they chambers
The average nigga raised by the average nigga, aye
It's the average nigga way
To say ""nigga"" with an ""a""
Riddle 'em and hit 'em with the K
Let it speak when he fiddle with the trigger
Let 'em kill 'em with the say
Sodom or Gomorrah
Which one are you the more of?
Chevy's sittin' on 30's and 20's on the Saurus
Fiendin' for that spot
The money bout to burn a hole in my pocket
So I got to extinguish that with a ""Blao""
Put it out with a Phantom
Bring it out on the block
With no driver
Hoes, y'all wanna drive or not!
I gotta peel the peddle
A lot of troops done died
Why deal with the devil, knowin' I got a truce with God?
Gotta peel the peddle
A lot of troops done died
Why deal with the devil, knowin' I got a truce with God?
I gotta peel the peddle
A lot of troops done died
Why deal with the devil, knowin' that I got a truce with God?

Flow like dis, never broke but flow for the dough like this
Never been a nigga that you know like dis
Cold like dis, but ah, it's just me and D-Mo like dis
Respect is a must, got every nigga in every hood checkin for us
Never catch us catchin the bus

Niggas got troops, got guns, got clips (what)

Iced out to go with the rest it seems
More or less the more of the best you seen
Big buzz, only rollin' with big thugs
We get in clubs you know you gettin' ya shit bust
Not too many ducks is goin' against us
If ya don't know now, you'll know when ya lift up

 Cuz you don't want nathan from a nigga that'll open you up
 You gotta send it back up when we holla

One of a hundred niggas'll hate my shit
Eighty-nine'll bite, the other ten'll think of comin alike
Cuz my shit when it come to the mic, 99 outta 100'll like
Never disrespect a nigga grippin the tec, it's my shit
Put the flow in affect with my clique
Go to the death, flow the best, my spit - I'm sick, it's my shit
Try to get slick and niggas is gettin hit
You don't want that do you? It comes back to you
And I ain't even tryna rap to you, so suck my dick, it's my shit
Too many willin to pin ya in rap
Put a endin to that, do the math with me
Straight to the lab, we're sendin you back
Keep going, you know that no one can last wit me
Stay armed with the biggest of arms, got bitch-niggas hittin alarms
Every rhyme is strictly writtin to harm

Put a bullet in yo' gut, bat em down and leave the sto' cut
Cuz homie you ain't got no choice ta
Dat why you runnin to a real rida like Twista, or Roysta
Let the thirty caliber anoint ya
Whodie won't even know he hit till he feel his shirt suckin the moisture
Voice ya opinion if ya want to
Kick-ass winner, kick up dust in the middle of the arena
Subpeona motherfuckaz like the courts do
We'll blast shortly ya nuts bust and it won't be a misdemeanor
We them niggas that'll come approach ya
Shockin ya body our Bacardi keeps all ya nerves from bleedin
Until we heard no breathin - two undercovers
We comin we get the dirty even; they know it's servin season
Shit is good as gone, cuz I gotta bring the goodies home
The petty packin penny brushin with the pretty pearl handle
Pistol, Pelle Pelle pants and the hoodie on
And you comin with the Midwest shit?
Remember how we took you, you trippin off how we did that shit
Somebody tell me where the weed at
Some niggas knew I was about to snap so he hid that shit
I was gon' get buck - come hard - get crunk
Go into a thing and let the rhyme ride
And hit them niggas from the blindside
And take the whole opposition down with my dog 5'9
Ceremony for the killaz, bustin em off
And comin off so you can bust yo' nut
Though I'm bout to bust yo' guts
But if yo' operation is hatin, who the fuck want what?

I like my hoes fast
I like my cars fast
Fuck it I should just go out and date Danica Patrick
I manufacture maniac rap if you askin'
Put life back in hip hop and put it back in it's casket
Fuck peace
You should try to dap and bury the hatchet
Then I'mma clap you and find somewhere to bury the ratchet

And yeah, ain't nobody true as us
You ain't gotta like me
I like me enough for the two of us
Don't compare me to the best rapper alive
I contemplate suicide to be compared to the best rapper that died
I'm killin' with them Boyz N The Hood like Cuba Gooding
I go to the place in the hood that the shooter shouldn't
We do the casing, you do the bookin'
Like the police
Speaking of them
We the reason they do the lookin'
I'm the label
I do the songs, I do the pushin'
So I'm sittin' on top of the world while you the cushion
I clean pussies up
Yeah, I do the douching
I'm Bill Cosby's teaspoon
And you the pudding
My cousin Eye is crazy
All I gotta do is wave and yeah, it's bye bye baby
I'm higher than Wayne and I rhyme like crazy
I shoot a nigga's ass with the nine like Gravy
I should like Shady
I keep a dime like Haley in a dark brown creme gut Klondike Sadie
It's like my kidney's compensate for what my liver couldn't
I'm a wolf, to kill me you're gonna need a silver bullet
Any one of you niggas fuck with me then it'll heat up
Y'all do nigga's beats
I make niggas give the beat up
Any nigga step up
I'mma make him step back
With either that Tec blaaat blaaat
Or 
that fifty caliber gold plated Desert Eazy
That's for who ever rebellious
The cartridge to it lookin' like The Legend Of Zelda
Born winner
Rhymin' like there's two horns in him
After I win the battle rap
I'mma blow your motherfuckin' head off
So you can call me a sore winner
I fuck with The Game
The rest of y'all give a fuck about too much shit
Me, I don't give a fuck about nothin'
I don't give a fuck about shit, but the outfit
My name fall out your mouth
I'm at your house quick
You don't want them boys at your crib
About six
Ready to let out a clip
Like ""Rap about this""
My crew is like your audience
We clap about shit
We sick
We don't be fightin' nobody
We probably fight each other whenever we drunk
That's about it
Approach the enemy with caution
Born leader
My identity is ?
Awe, ain't he awesome?
I've been known to stick a nigga
No homo
My dick get hard when I feel on the trigger nigga
Murder every verse
My rhyme is like a heavy hearse
Each word is deeper than cemetery dirt
That fully automatic
I pull it and let him work
Do him a favor and spray his head
I ain't gonna let him hurt
You better watch your mouth
Cause I can knock you out
But I'd rather give the Glock somethin' to talk about
I'm in your bushes with the ump, thumpin'
Y'all about to dance with the one night stand
Soon as you +Walk It Out+
Give you the afterlife
You got a smart mouth
You a dick and a pussy like you a hermaphrodite
Assassinate you this evenin'
It's assassin-night
Have you weezin'
You and Eddie Murphy can laugh alike
The Revival
You can call it the Preme project
But it's violent
You should call it the pork and bean project

I wanna introduce to y'all my lil' homie Tyga
My homie Kuniva
And my girl Diamond
It's going down!

Ugh, you could try to hit me with the napalm
I'm already Smokey and you're more Faizon
Big Worm, bet five she put her lips on
On my wood, 'cause I'm three-ball
None of y'all hook, ugh, Nate Dogg (
Woo!
)
Silencers, gold, gold chains and Goyard
So you tatted up—now you me? Ha, great job
Y'all buffoonery, clowns with they face drawn
I got the recipe, now, I cook the Raekwon
Ugh, too much makeup, that's a muddy face
I don't chase bitches, ugh, I chase cake
I don't eat beef, but I heart steak
All my prey in the air, now, I say my grace
Sheesh! They don't want 
Wanna get away? Don't run from me
I'm getting money, y'all rollerblading on the beach
It's Young Money, Cash Money, free Weezy

Yo, it's D12, I will backslap her and you
The toolie tucked with the gators and the foreign suit
I'll take your moms out to dinner, and I'm scoring, too
We the pack of niggas Mel Gibson was referring to
I gotta shine like the jewelry on Mr. T
I'm drunk holding up the line at Mickey D's
The dice game, I hit the point, then, I get the cheese
My style's furious like the father of 
My cannons go, when they blow, open sesame
These small battle-rap clowns never step to me
You want views; I want mils, no Stephanie
And I'ma get it—take that to the bank, bow! Steady P (
Woo!
)
Since Proof left, that part of my mind's gone
You talking slick like an oiled-up iPhone
With eight million sold, yeah, I'm in rhyme mode
I'm the only one that's fly from the No Fly Zone (
Woo!
)

Yeah, fresh off maternity leave with no stitches
Nine months off to birth you broke bitches
Whip game sick, my flow is so vicious
Pit off the leash my bite is so vicious
Y'all fictitious, name just irrelevant
I’m the real deal, y'all just surrogates (
Mmm
)
And they wonder why I'm so arrogant
'Cause I'm a mouse in the room full of elephants
32 flavors, pussy so tasteful
Pussy so good, make a nigga be faithful
Y'all should just thank me, all y'all mimic me
I raised you bitches, all y'all Mini-Mes
Marc Jacobs, Mac makeup
I cut checks while these chicks get checks cut
Gonorrhea flow, so the shit can burn
Show my ass off, Montana Fishburne

The day I stop droppin' the hotness
Will be the day I'm driving in a Datsun
With 50 Tyson and Antoine Dodson
My Wikipedia: First rapper to make MediaTakeOut
For taking out someone from the media
I'm somethin' they wanna censor, something that comes from inward
Makes me wanna call Dr. Laura, Mel Gibson and Doggy The Bounty Hunter ""a bunch of N-Words""
I gotta admit it, I'm kinda corrupt
He's a machine till I wire him up
I make his whole damn team transform like Shia Labouf
Rappers can be talkin' about who's hotter
Tryin' to get Montana Fishburne fame I make him Cube's father
Watch me, I'm comin'
I got a baby Cannon on me that's bigger than the one that Mariah got in her stomach
After me, there will be no more
The black Phantom got the all-black Fantasia Barrino doors

Maybe you should or maybe you just shouldn't
Cause baby this gun'll take you so far away, ay

Maybe you should or maybe you shouldn't
Cause me and my goons'll take you so far away, ay

It's definitely a burner
It's on cause that beef be the recipe to murder
Whoever's in my session's an accessory to murder
My words put niggas to bed, my records be the Serta
Ay, the raw grind is comin up like wall climbers
Big shit poppin, them pricks is small timers
And y'all musta forgot like Juelz Santana perform
At Hip Hop Honors with the Alzheimer's
I hear you woofin, come on, come to the dog diner
We all eat dogs, we raw, we bark buyers
You can't walk by us and talk fly or we'll hogtie ya
Nickel done fucked around and caught fire
I carry the torch and split a nigga up-up
Somebody gon' die, die like a scary divorce
Of course my goons is astoundin
Nigga I use the Auto-Tune because I'm clownin

Maybe you should or maybe you just shouldn't
Cause baby this gun'll take you so far away, ay

Maybe you should or maybe you shouldn't
Cause me and my goons'll take you so far away, ay

Nigga you don't want a problem
I'm photogenic, my image belong on a dollar, authentic
My tennis shoes should have ""I'm killin you"" written on the side of
The willingness to go in, like whatever's inside of a diver
Get in his ass like a sodomizer
Fix him by any means like the plot of MacGyver
Nickel runnin for shit, you need to vote for him
They unloadin his flow off of the boat for him
Pardon me Miss Sniffle Nose, the coke charm
I spit shit crazy, with the toast arms
My kicks is crazy, like Zohan
I'm the nucleus of this like a proton
Gat supplier, red nose
Carving your staff or shire, rap for hire
Niggas is corny by nature, on top of that
Niggas arms is shorter than my nigga Vinny from Naughty by Nature

Maybe you should or maybe you just shouldn't
Cause baby this gun'll take you so far away, ay

Until my belly stick out as far as the Octo-mom's
I'm an abomination
I'm an anomaly in conversation, I'm honoring confrontation
With a dime doing dominatrix on her
Disrespect me – I'll wet you like condensation, water
I'm a mixture between Chris Brown
And Chris Jericho, where's your daughter?
I'm more than y'all can handle
At the Grammy's I'll send an Indian girl to the podium
To say ""No, thank you""
Like Marlon Brando for Oscars, ""the Godfather""
Our father, you should praise me
I got some syphilis nunchucks wearing a AIDS gi
That mean I'm sick when I kick shit
Come to my concert get some sars on the tip of your ticket
I'm super cold
I don't spit, I shit, on your whole team

Fuck radio, fuck video

Cause I'm a diamond, I'm llama rhyming, you Ramadan-in'
Simon says that in my prime I'm here
Everywhere I go it's a crime there
While you on-looking at me in the lawn chair
Cocaine, propane
I'm a living degenerate of the dope game

The Way I Be Pimpin’ (Xxplosive Part 2),Build and Destroy,2003,"* hidden bonus track; written by Royce for Dr. Dre

I might make it look easy, that's just the way I be pimpin'
Makin my money, that's just the way I be pimpin'
They wouldn't leave me, that's just the way I be pimpin'
You might not believe me, that's just the way I be pimpin'

I'm livin a motion picture, me and my niggas
In sixteen bars we'll make the big screen ours
What is this? Everybody's jiggy now, is the hustle that good
In everybody's city now, or do they act good?
I pimp on the street, I pimp in my sleep
And when I snore it sounds like I'm sayin, ""Where's my money?""
I ain't playin, I'm out there like, ""Where's my honeys?""
You gotta be a pimp to understand just how I'm layin
Fuck a Lex Bubble; I'm rich, and after this
I'mma be rich all over again, except double
See you ain't so hard; if you ain't burnin rubber
In somethin with numbers after the dot, you ain't no star
Me and my whole crew, done either shot a nigga or been shot
And if you check us out, ain't no scars
Hint - steppin to me is suicide
And that basically means that you could die, true superfly


My life's in the fast lane
, that's when I knew I had game
Class came, I had hoes but didn't know they last name
In school, when you niggas was tradin clothes
Me and my niggas was tradin hoes like what they fadin fo'
Carry my books you ho, I had 'em slavin yo
I get skulled then I played the ho like, ""Way to go""
Patrollin the halls holdin a black mac-11
Under the black leather, platforms, a hat with a feather
I was so naughty, drivin a gold Audi
All we did was throw parties and show up, with Gold Gotti
Handsome, and some, I'm the one you ran from
Cause you could only be the man in the shit that I was banned from
Make this shit seem easy, fiends need me
Make the most conceited chick in this bitch seem sleazy
Pleased at what I'm doin
And to all y'all pimp niggas, pimp on, and 
I'll see y'all at the reunion",https://genius.com/Royce-da-59-the-way-i-be-pimpin-xxplosive-part-2-lyrics

You in the club minding ya own business and out of nowhere you here this
How you supposed to act, 
Neptunes, Royce 5'9"", it's my year baby

Twelfth grade rode around, started out small
My father told me, before you walk, you gotta crawl
We was all outlaws wit our fists balled
We couldn't even count bars, we was just raw
MCer's battlin' at the club, for the plug
Rappin' for the other rappers, strictly for the love
That was cool 'til my life turned, and got tough
I got a girl, got serious, got her knocked up
Uh oh, reality check, hold up
I gotta figure out a way, to get this dough up
I don't want my son to hate me, when he grow up
So I gotta blow up, and leave it to' up (Five-Nine, baby)
I listened to my pops, whenever it got hard
He said look if you gon' be a star, be a star
I got hot, got a deal took rap
Took the whole city wi me, and never looked back, baby

We can do it now, nigga I'm off parole

It's all simple, make a million off the intro
Y'all don't want it, cause you still say ya fin' to
I'm finna blow, like this shit is so mental
That's your life, your problem, and your pencil
Cut the jokes, everybody wanna be rich
You a fool if you don't, you see this
Look at this chain, this bracelet, you hear me
I don't won't respect, I want you to fear me
Now look at me, this shit is getting real now
I want your money, I'mma spit what you can feel now
I tell the truth, so I guess I keep it real now
You thought I was ill befo', now I'm ill now
Come on wit it, I can afford to kill now
Look at my son, ask him how he feel now
It's real now, daddy's got a pill now
Wave bye-bye we out of the hood, what the deal now

30 years where it became a big lot
600s on chrome, you don't stop
Detroit we just hot
Young niggas stay fly at all times
Hoes 21 and under with gangsta rides
Keep our guns by our sides at all times
Detroit we just fly

You would love for me and you to switch places won't ya
You love hatin' don't cha, hate just to hate, don't ya
In the clubs yelling loud, like you wanna fight
But I just whisper, you ain't trying to die tonight
I'm the king, yo I'm like the son of Jesus
We got guns, and we'll use 'em, so please believe it
Last had to try me, yeah I looked passed him
But notice he's nowhere around, for you to ask him
Long as I gotta crew, and two in the safe baby
You could scream 'til you BLUE in the face baby
We getting ours, we don't care who in the way baby
Lock and key, ain't nothin' you could save baby

They didn't get a chance to blow but they could flow so well

He musta been moving with B.G

On the street credibility, he's a ""Soldier""

I don't know, I never met him
I just know that I ain't trying to forget him
As soon as he went home, the place he got the most love
Niggas popped up and shot him in cold blood
At the worst time and they crept up behind him
And uh, just rewinded em

Story Two
I said boyyyyy, would you boss up and get this money
For my niggas who ain't here
Bring the treeeees, and blow a huge cloud in the air
For niggas who move without fear
Gotta pour more than a beer, nigga pour out a fifth
Fuck it we rich nigga, pour out some Cris
A young nigga got shot up once, put in a wheelchair
Still liked to light up blunts like ""look, I'm still here""
It's so true
He came out of the hospital with way more money, way more jewels
Roll through, any hood that you want in the City of Detroit
They playing one of his tunes
He prolly shoulda been with a goon
He stopped at a car wash
I guess the dude he was with ain't know what to do
They crept up on the side of 'em and
Put the nine to 'em and, just rewinded em

Story Three
We bout to take the NYC
They know about him in the NYC
But they don't know him in the D
As far as emceeing, this nigga was crazy
Muthafuckas used to say he was better than Jay-Z
The first time time I heard him was '95 ""Ebonics""
I played it and all my niggas was high tryin to rewind it
Them niggas was like, ""Daaaammnn""
This nigga said that a snot box was a nose
Without stopping the flow and I was like, ""maannnnn""
I swear to God that this nigga's a problem
I think he better than Nas (damn)
He's so ahead of his time, you play his music in 0-6
This nigga sound regular now
I heard that he was thugging, had a brother who was thugging
He was sitting on a stoop and he didn't see it comin'
They crept up in front of em and
Put the gun to em and, just rewinded em

Yeah, the street's gotta code
Cause being loud is old
Silent is gold, smile and unload
No police gotta know
Cause when ya problem is told
Ya problem isn't getting told, that's a no
I just told a couple stories about the notorious route
That niggas take when they thirst

Yeah, still you lame, high as it be
If I'm ya highness in ya streets, I can honestly compete
Wit any nigga, feel the pain, my odyssey just creeps
Peep a nigga silver chain, no diamonds in the peice
I been chillin on dog for years... now you hard?
I got scars bigger in ya individual career
Who the fuck is Denaun, he don't even write rhymes
Actin like he rap harder then who - the Kon Artis is you
Now you get spoken up on how the heats on you
Nigga you must be smokin and jokin
Slim got 50, and now it's time for change
Shady records lookin like a broke down dollar, you gotta be ashamed
And you can't even stop it
Em got 50 Cent, the rest of you niggas change in his pocket
Don't you niggas see he let you come and get twisted
And you dissin me, but you niggas is unfinished business
SMUCK you niggas tryna be
On every other niggas nuts, in the industry you findin me
From Busta Rhymes to Jay-Z to Nas to ME!
Didn't see me, yet them niggas won't you to rhyme wit peeks
Niggas is HIDIN in the streets, lyin on me
It's funny, cause they paint a picture like I be in TONS of beef
Be out every night fightin, provin shit
Jealous ass niggas, I ain't gotta prove shit!
That means you could die from the felt response
Fear my next move like, Eminem huggin on Elton John
Except Y'ALL playin career Russian Roulette
There will never be another D-12 album nigga, what you bet
Who ain't eatin, I'mma star, nigga, on my 4th deal
I'm so full, 
I'm feelin fatter then Bizarre
MINUS the shower cap
, and them dirty-ass Nike's
Minus the stutter, minus the ugly-ass wife
Y'all don't know what it takes to win, nigga
I'll spar up wit ya boss, we made each other show up late to the gym
So I said it - you niggas is whack
That nigga ask me my opinion, is it true, don't fall for that
Nigga step unto the turf, everybody think y'all WHACK
What you gon' write a diss record to the earth?
You niggas is Shady statistics, the whole world know
Who the broke-ass crew, wit the radio hits is
Warren's niggas is takin ya pictures, you just dummy's
You less money then Slim spends on Hailie for Christmas
I know Slim see the mistakes that he made
Treatin y'all like Dre treated Hittman, and Lady of Rage
Even them niggas is smarter then y'all niggas, the cloth
That I whip my fuckin gun down, is harder then y'all
Ya hustle is over, the rhyme bout is through
I got ya coach on the sideline, touchin his shoulder

My niggas that ain't with all the drinkin', they want herb
So even though the car plush
The ashtray full of dark butts
Like we rollin' up lookin' for Yung Berg
Top off, bitch in the front, domin' me up 'til my rock soft
Either that or she gon' get lockjaw
Stop? Naw! If she come up for air, I cut her of
Like Jesse Jackson with a hand on Barack's balls

It ain't nothing like love from the hood
Ain't no feeling like rolling through knowing you good
Cause you been keeping it real
When niggas see you, they salute you

Love from the hood
Ain't no feeling like rolling through knowing you good
Cause you been keeping it true
When niggas see you, they salute

Royce da 5'9"" give ya ill verses
Ryan Montgomery is the real person
No makeup, that's why you couldn't touch me up
I remember being locked up
This nigga walked up, tryna battle, I went ahead and let 'em finish
Then I told 'em, ""Do that again, I'mma fuck you up""
Now take a journey through a nigga's psyche
The only snitch in my life is the chick tryna split up me and wifey
You think you like me, I'm aight with that
I don't even call my nigga Budden ""Mouse"", it sound too much like a rat
So may your steps be just like your stacks
High, afraid of death, having a life attack
It's I, got the soldiers for the coca price
Your poker face on, I'm a turn your channel to the Poltergeist
My outta town niggas know the business
When you land, I'll come get you, we gon' get it


It ain't nothing like love from the hood
Ain't no feeling like rolling through and knowing you good
Cause you been keeping it trill
When niggas see you, they salute you

It ain't nothing like walking your block
One deep on your city streets nigga, no hawk or no Glock
No blades in your mouth or box cutters in socks
Cause real niggas show love and bad bitches on your jock
Every corner got a homie you know well
Even if somebody see a deal, then they won't tell
Your man say he got the goods, so you trying him out
The ice cream truck roll through, you buying 'em out
The youngstas helping out the old folks, with something hard to do
The kids is playing, nobody beefing and it's a barbeque
And every backyard with the old school jams on
Sweet potato pie courtesy of your grandma
Already, everybody's home, nobody on the yard
We drinking and smoking the night away with no regard
Nobody arguing and everything's good
Man it ain't nothing like love from the hood, that's understood


Come on, it ain't nothing like love from the hood
Ain't no feeling like coming through knowing you good
Cause you be keeping it G
When they see you, they salute you

Word, it ain't nothing like, what I do every other night
Pick up the liquor, send the fiends to go get the cups and ice
Sit on that project bench and have some of the funnest nice
We spend that wrong doing making money the summer right
The smell of somebody barbeque got my stomach hype
'tata salad, rice and some chicken, a little something light
A beast with the cards, they always ask me to shuffle twice
Swear that I be cheating, I'm just fucking nice, cut that
Rug rat, niggas that robbed, never tried your boy
Only just me, no security that I employ
I never need to wear iron toy, I ain't naive
I just hang with some killers and I'm their pride and joy
But nah, ain't about that right now
It's about the jokes, weed smoke and the cat fights, meow
It's about them New Year's on the roof, with your gat like bloaw
Outside the booth I'm the truth, give me dap like ""Yaowa""",https://genius.com/Royce-da-59-hood-love-lyrics

Niggas quick to talk all hood 'til I pop up
Plus, you just act tough cause Suge got locked up
I am above y'all, when you droppin your raps to diss me
I only recognize the top of your hats
And I don't like Proof punk-ass, he think he tough
He keep thirty niggas with him, cause he weak as fuck!
I ever catch you by yourself, I'ma fuck you up
Snatch your little cheap-ass chain and piece you up
You better hope you and the white boy keep in touch
And be a good little hype man, or your lease is up
Since Slim signed 50, I don't see your teeth as much
That's good, cause you got a grill like a fuckin truck!
DAMN HOMIE, it's history, over, hang it up
Go somewhere and hang up some 50 posters, PUNK
You speak you late, y'all prolly gon' go up to them awards
And get yo' ass whooped by B2K
I just wish Eminem would stop tellin' everybody he ain't speakin' to me
Like I'm one of his hoes or somethin'
How 'bout this, I ain't speakin to you, chump
And I'ma keep pickin on your weak ass crew
You, BITCH, Bizarre you a fat stutterin fuck
You a joke, I choke whoever buttered you up

Nigga you can run or hide; I'll be on your porch
With a cheeseburger tryin to lure you outside!
Cause he's in it, Bizarre say G-g-g-g-g-g-unit
I bet you throw some extra ""g's"" in it
Just like a stutterin' fool can't reach intelligence
He sweats when he raps, cause he got a speach impediment
You, BITCH, Porky's pig and Porky's tomb
About to dig his own grave with a fork and spoon
You, BITCH, Denaun and Swifty please

You don't wanna talk to Royce, but you talk to Puff
You, BITCH, yo' crew some local hoes

Show me who's talkin' and I'll off 'em
From Austin to Boston, make 'em floss in coffins
Shit, if I ain't the man, I'm standin' next to him
Starvin'
Somebody bring me a Dexatrim
To suppress my appetite
I feast on niggas who ain't rappin' right
Learn in the after life
If I ain't the best baller, I'm right after Mike
Cockier than the nigga that made Flashing Lights
I'm the king of the jungle
I'll stop all the scoring on your block without bringin' Mutumbo
100 round drums is what I bring to the rumble
Brash
I ain't get a thing when I was humble
And why should I be?
Niggas ain't good as me
The best black champ we had in a while like Booker T
One of the best, but overlooked like I'm Pusha T
You little pussies get fucked
Here go the douche for free
It ain't too much that Marv can't do
Make way for royalty

Bubble lights do a double life crime what else then?

Hood rats on me cause I'm in a trap
I'm gonna give her cheese then
She with me, she never dick teasin'
The wrist freezin'
She's tellin' me I'm just seizin'
She do whatever I tell her long as it's with reason
So I'm gonna tell her to blow me until she quits breathin'
She play her position, but it's me receivin'
The cum come through them gums looks like the bitch teethin'
Diss me, get treated like you was just leavin'
After I quit squeezin'
I'm the shit fool
Every year in my past, my shit list grew
Niggas switched up and got ripped up like Rick Rude
Yeah, I don't fuck around with that mic
You try to fuck with me you probably fuck around with that white
What you a cluck?

Nigga get in ya car, if he pissin' you off
Get him, I don't wanna picture you pausin', cuz
Been with you from the pedal to the floor
From the shovel to the fo' fo'
The devil only showed up for show
Turn this up, turn off your phone
And leave the ""You wanna talk peace?"" at home
Faces corpse or face 'em in court
If you don't face 'em you gon' pay, yo safety is short
I got a babe to work for the courts
I'mma license plate number away from the front of your porch
Or from the side of your house, the product of a ride or die is about
I'm the opposite of a lot of mouth
It's strange y'all repent after saying my name I'm 'bout to change it like Prince call me: *gunshot*
The ski mask, the beef with the street trash
The leaves, the trees, the grass at ya pad, he's mastered
Squeeze faster, instead of beatin his ass
Just let 'em have it and you can be the last one standing

At night or in broad day
Drive by or sitting in the bushes all day
However you hunt (go get 'em!)
The K, the AR, the pump, the handgun
Get it done however you want (go get 'em!)
Park in the front, get out, walk and then dump
Pull off slow, leaving no tire marks in the front, go!
The gorilla, know he gon' leave footprints
So he get his shoes a size or so bigger
I learned niggas'll turn on you young
Just as the gun misses it hits shit, hence the term killa
Stop lights are not at night
It's where you get chopped up if you stop, nigga
Maybe the cops might
So roll through and fast forward his life
Blow noodles on his dash board, nigga no excuses
I seen plenty survive, weighing 185
In a land where skinny niggas die
You gotta

One for the Money,UnKnown,2012.0,"It goes one for the money, two for that paper
Three for that drive to get it
You gotta dive in it
I guess that’s just in my spirit
Nigga, I will walk, fly, try to get it

I’m a representation of triumph
I don’t lose, therefore I guess it’s a waste of trying
I'm the check man
I do this shit strictly for the money every day
The love went away with X-Clan
The love kept me on the underground
Each verse went deeper and deeper so I had to resurface
Get the cake and keep working
Demonstrate a lesson to them every album
I can teach perfect
I ain’t a cheap person
But if you wound up underground and you ain’t hungry then you at least thirsty
The streets where it’s at my nigga
Blacking out ‘til the streets get cracked my nigga

It goes one for the money, two for that paper
Three for that drive to get it
Four’s for the raw metaphors and the way I spit it
Nigga I will walk, fly, try to get it
It goes one for the money, two for that paper
Three for that drive to get it
Four’s for the raw metaphors and the way I spit it
And y’all will not eat until we get finished

Yo the kid got game, the kid get props
The kid spitting the flames, the kid don’t stop
The kid been grinding now he’s getting that guap
I was visiting the bottom now I’m getting to the top
Doing what we do, that’s what we get the props for
This is for my dudes living like rock stars
One two three, three two one
Yeah the haters over there, but I keep ignoring them
I’m in the pit any day, just like a stockbroker
Nah, I ain’t flossing, I’m just living how I’m supposed to
Y’all get straight flushed like poker
Never thought it’d be Skillz on your baby mama’s poster
Told ya, doubters get knocked off
You ain’t believe me, but nines bout to pop off
That’s how we do it and we stack the stacks
It’s your boy Skillz homey, million dollar backpack

Too many clowns sweet and hard, nut and honey
Chasing fast cars and dreams, nuttin honeys
You know it life ain’t nothing funny
I went from bluffing dummies to world tours man, it’s nothing money
I’m surrounded by investors with Winchesters
Super X black shadow chin testers
I don’t run with jesters
So if I give you a pass know it was just a slim gesture
Too many niggas swallowing
Too many niggas running around with no business, that be frolicking
You in a bad space wallowing
I’m in the GL five-and-a-half with the bright halogen
Gucci moccasins, Benetton sweater
J.O.K. there’s never been a don better
Southern Bluefin prawns, ameretta
I fuck life with a vendetta

We Detroit niggas
The illest breed of niggas to breathe
Detroit niggas Kill on the street
Kill an MC
Kill on the beat
Kill on the creep
Kill in my sleep
Kill with my peeps
Kill a nigga
Ha! kill with my heat
Got them not moving their lips like ventriloquists
Issue the hit empty the clip until his ten becomes six
Trampoline you off your feet in the form of flips
Fill him with lead got him writing his name with his dick
I got niggas like it's a walk to school worth my goods
I got niggas pumping for blood in the heart of your hood
The fact remains you're better off praising our name
Beef with us that'd cost about your life in change
Fuck that all y'all strange niggas to me
Fuck that my niggas'll hang niggas for me
You living or dying? nigga you know I'm gripping the iron
For the drama your man is a bitch and I'm itching to try him
 (2X)

I promise to live on the side of the tracks
Where witnesses is frequently trading shoes for ? tags
We want war so we coming to get it in blood
And we ain't leaving without something to put in the mud
Pleading for your life with more one-liners than rhyme fights
Backfire on niggas who don't handle their mind right
Shine bright and we straight thug niggas with problems
Just making it known long as we got them then y'all got them
Got it listen that's your brain talking to you
You did what i said you'd do look what I led you to
I'm above your hood so i can dead you too
You living in the belly of the beast that I fed you to
I know it's cold go to the light they calling for you
Be a man set an example what a baller would do
Him and all his crew can fall in to
The wrath of the 17 shot exposure I told you!
 (2X)

Size you up six feet couple inches
Sneak attack a cat who naps with slow senses
Red dot gun cocked picture me missing
Aim precise steady hand and start spitting
I'm hard hitting and ready to disregard living
I call life hell I call bars prison
You all off rhythm trying to ball wit' him
Worse off, trying to brawl wit' him all fall victim
Slow down guy before your brakes fall off
And you crash into something that ain't that soft
You ain't that raw gun in your face what's up now?
Pleading to make it right you need to say goodnight

ROYCE: Aight, have a good night

Looking out my window, from my ninth floor hotel room
I remember that cold, cold, rainy night
Looking out my window

Feeling all alone on the run, I'm still holding onto my gun
Body on it from the previous evening, I found out I'm wanted
Niggas snitching is what the media screaming
I turn the channel on the TV, The First 48 on
Man, it ain't a loyal nigga on this TV nowhere
I cut the power off, disgusted
I'm contemplatin takin a shower to take all the gunpowder off
But what if they bust in, busting?
The nigga at the front desk act like he don't recognize me
But shiiiit, there's a reward for me, that nigga there hustling
I can't trust him, I gotta keep my eye on that window
Thinking about my kinfolk, wife and babies
I can't talk to them, life is crazy
Whoever thought it would come to this over rap nonsense?
Wrapped in the comfort of being attacked by my conscience

Looking out my window, from my ninth floor hotel room
I remember, that cold-cold rainy night
Looking out my window

I think I'ma write a letter to my children

In case, I don't make it
I'm up against time, but I won't face it
I'm thinking about my life, what it is now
And how one slug can change what it once was
I'm accepting the fact that I did that
I just want my wife back, I just want my kids back
I just want my niggas that don't snitch back
Cause real niggas know real niggas ain't with that
But what's the use of me being real? I'm fucked now
I'm seeing sirens out the window thinking ""What now?""
Damn, am I to do?
Cause now that shit hit the fan, I suddenly ran out of crew
But fuck it, I'm in the shit, I'ma end the shit
No way for me to benefit though I'm innocent
I hear a knock on the door like, ""Let's finish this!""

This is the Detroit police! We got the building surrounded. We know you're in there, asshole. Come out! We're gonna give you to the count of three. One, two,... three! Get the fucking gun! Drop it! Officer down! Officer down! Hold your fire! Hold your fire! Suspect down! I repeat: suspect down!

This is for my nigga Keno. (Shout to Keno)

There's got to be
Nobody hot as me
Flow outta this world like Odyssey
That's why your girl ridin' me

For the summer, she like me
Cause I operate with numbers like the lottery
Dick in the dook chute
What you know about sodomy
I do what I want with her body
I'm a commodity
Last Real Nigga Alive
2Pac's prodigy
Take it even past conceited
I mock modesty
I'm major
Bitch it ain't trickin' if you gettin' it
That's why niggas don't be trippin' when I pays her
My whole clique just like me
We roll in circles in packs
They call us the Life Savers
She behave, I put her beside nice neighbors
Let her ride to the top of that high rise
And that dark fader
I call it that
Cause the second you steppin' with the weapon
It's gonna light up like it's light saber
The car creeps invisible through the dark streets
With the lights off because it's dark with dark feet
I call a cab at any Miami heart beat
My bitch drawin' my bath like she a art-ist
I'm a kingpin, son
I don't bark at puppies I ain't Queen Pen's son
The second one of y'all rap niggas start talkin' bout y'all boxin' me
Bet it's gonna be ding then done
Swingin'
Only my ink pen runs
Never been chased
Been A-1 from day one (yes)
I don't know who the fuck you is
But I'll show you what the fuck this is
I fuck with the same type of niggas that fucked with Big
Niggas that'll throw them over the bridge
Right after they fuck your kids
Niggas get all surprised when 5'9"" responds to 'em
I'm like naw, I ain't gonna do the Saigon to 'em
I leave the slappin' to him
I do 'em more like Ben Wallace
Alonzo Mourning and put the arm to 'em
Forget the arguin'
Cause once the contract is intact
It's a wrap
Now the Mobb is signed to 'em
But fuck beef nigga
Life is short
It don't stop till they take you off that life support
Basically
Beefin' with me, your life is shorter
The definition of a Christ supporter
I come down like the wrath of the hand that made you
In the flesh of his flesh
And the blood of his blood, I bathe you
The flows amazin'
I closed the deal for show
My respect for your soul I'll trade you
But you probably already don' gave it to Satan
Cause how the fuck you doin' sold out stadiums?
To God, you as big as a baby bug
Doin' all them crazy drugs
You gon be hotter on the day you judged
Y'all niggas peakin' out your careers like EQs
Deep down in your ears you're hearin' he's true
But you won't let it out, you weak
You refuse
So I'm gonna stay deep in the field like cleat shoes
If I done reached out to a dude to do a song
And it ain't happen
I give him dap and I move on
It ain't nothin' personal nigga
This is a business
This is the shit that we do to put our kids in cribs with
Nigga I'm a 80's baby
Fiend, foamin' at the mouth like rabies baby
Why you knockin' a G?
The only threesome you seen's on your TV
Somebody with a release right outside the top of the key
I'm right back in 'em
The truth's in these eyes
So you can believe I
Like that denim
I still say Shady's the greatest
But some people believe
I'm the only one around who can put the light back in him
But I don't like that

No

Lot of speculation on the moneys I made, honeys I've slaved
How is he for real? Is that nigga really paid?
Hustlaz that I've met, or dealed with direct
Is it true he never sold dope, but he still get respect? (Yes!)
What he doin' in AC with Miko, that boy a pimp
How he make his money? Is he really worth 40 Ms?
Yes, to the questions, now give me a minute to rest
While you lookin' at the ice cold, spinnin' on my chest
Ugh, nice chain, does he really have a Range?
That's MBs, but in the D, he's the hottest thing
You never seen me drive, cause a couple of DUIs
But I got a driver, holla at me if you need a ride
 (Holla at me!)
When I'm in the D, I'm in the B-M
Leanin' to the anthem, on my way to Phoenix to the Phantom
I been spittin' shits since '89
What's up with 50? Is he interested in him? Would Shady mind?
I saw him walkin' up in Daddy's house, what's up with that?
If that nigga writin' for Diddy, Puff is back (a million)
Questions niggas ask after I made (a million)
Tommy Boy, Sony Records, gave me (a million)
That's why every time you see me I'm lookin' like (a million)
Bucks no matter what, no matter the L's, wins, sales, spins
I'mma hustle on like a sales, man
As long as I'm hotter than hell, then
I'mma stay afloat like a whale's, fin
What's up with him and Premier? Do they really got a group?
Are they tryin' to replace Gang Starr? What are they tryin' to prove?
I seen him on Beef 2, was he really tellin' the truth?
Did he really set up a truce to that thing he developed with Proof?
I heard he was ballin' out, I heard he just bought a house
And this one is much bigger, cause this one is farther out
What's up with him and Kelis? Is he still cool with her best friend?
""That nigga Nas really tryna sign him?"" Is the question
Ugh, he fire, you really can't deny him
The only nigga rhymin' harder than Holmes retired
Put him up against any nigga that's out today (What about 'em?)
Don't say they names. I already know who you about to say
(A million)
 
Niggas you think you fuck wit' me 'til
(A million) Dollars on the line, and then you hear

Tack on who didn't wanna act as gentlemen (whoa)
Act on adrenelin, the cap gon' peel 'em

Because you keep the nine witchu - you gettin your mind lifted
Quicker than knockin 'em men, I'm too blowed to rhyme witchu (whoa)

Doin drive-bys on lowrider bicycles (bloaw bloaw!)

The murder case you beat to yourselves and throw up the peace sign (peace!)

Say that I AM the way that I AM

It's unsafe to try to see if I would spray the way that I AM
If you was trying to see if I'm what I say that I AM

The miscommunication is in the MIND-FRAME
It's basically a CON game
Just play your cards right cause you don't know who's BLUFFING

I, wannnnt you, sweat my weave ouuuut (yeah!)

No mistake, June the great
Fucked the most hoes at Michigan State
Technique should be in the textbook
Love to have the ones that like to look
At their reflection, while we're sexin
Wanna smoke while we fuck? No question
Bitch yeah, is it cool for three?
Cause two girls just don't do it for me, I'm a beast
Hit it from the back, let me grab her ankles
Thumb's in the asshole, take the pain slow
Jump back on that cock, keep rockin
Hundred milligram pill, bitch no stoppin
Keep poppin, energy droppin
Neighbors complain, say we too loud often
Another world - you love it
Don't you? My favorite nasty girl


Yeahhh bitch, yeah take this sugar dick bitch
Take it, yeah, take this jackhammer
You ain't know I had that jackhammer, did you?
Yeah say M.I.C. bitch, say Vishis
Call me Vishis bitch, yeah (Vishis! M.I.C.!)

It goes up, down, once again
I fuck and make hoes confess they sins
Gotta make sure what's ya age again
Wish she had me on tape to show your friends
Have a king size bed when I fuck hoes over three times after sex
I don't even wanna smell your breath
My roommate peeps in
And uh (what's happenin) we both hit that again

Get 'em in a rental, get 'em in a Range
Give a nigga brain; let my nigga watch, keep him entertained
It's a wonderful thing
Don't you go gettin all sentimental with game, let a nigga bang
Ride the Titanic
Most niggas go from small to large, I go from wide to gigantic
Let a nigga call in
As soon as I'm caught in, I'mma try to make a nigga fall in
Dig a deeper hole in it when I hit it
Put her on feet patrol, send her to the sto'
Never let her tell a nigga ""no""

I'm like the fear that Biggie and Pac is comin'

We fought, but you kept it a secret
Talking about what you gonna do when find me and keep seeing me
Liein' like you diein' to catch me and put three in me
Told him cut the jokes, but I guess that he wasn't hearin' me
Convince himself that he wasn't fearin' me

Ride with me whether they know the destination or not, that's me
The baddest rap you heard in a while
Ride with the gat in the lap, convertible style, that's me

Decaid funk from a punk comin' out of my truck
Everybody wanna thug with them triggers they pullin'
Be shooting pip-pip guns that ain't as big as my bullets
Live from Detroit coming to a block near you
Real soon so somebody might get popped near you
All you wanna do is rap, I be listenin' right
Have to flip a big difference between a clip and a mic
I'm a soldier, cool as I want to be, gun totin'
Talking to hoes, rude as I want to be, who wants some of me?
This is no problem that I can't fix, I got a crew that I brung with me
Hardcore niggas you're nothin'
Ben Franklin run this motherfucker and in God I trust 'em
If you ever see my guns out, they probably bustin'
While you niggas is ridin' or diein', I'll be truckin'

You should bust yo' gat with care

I'm laughin' that's why this album is so morbidly put

You can go in that booth and call me all kinds of names
But motherfucker you gotta come out
So whoever hatin' my team
Remember who the gun totin', who provoked the fat lady to sing
It's one rule everybody should know
Everybody should calm down and just live 'cause

I can open your mind quicker than that marijuan' that you smokin'

Real Hip Hop,The Bar Exam 3: The Most Interesting Man,2010.0,"Mr. Porter has asked me to warn you that this next joint may harm your speakers

If this ain't real hip hop nigga tell me what it is then
Walking sci-fi cyborg, my image is
Napalm, translation, you tampon bleed
Like the opposite of mankind
Tryna put your hands on my damn rod
You might as well handstand on a land mine
If I ain't bout that, let adversity hurt me
Like if I ain't bounce back, all I do is count stacks
You can't put me and flames in the same quote
Beast on the track, me and Usain Bolt in the same boat
Mention me and lightning in the same volt
Crqckers amphibian, I'm a handful
Guns give you suntans like a Pakistan Indian, pop shit
Quick enough to snatch a fly out the air with some fuckin' chopsticks
Uh-uh-uh, nigga, who hotter than me?
I'm on a million dollar-AK-hollering spree (Nickel!)

If this ain't raw shit, then nigga, I'm lost in the game
And that means everyone remains comin' with that soft shit
This is that dark flow, caught up in the alley walking
Like Losing Out Pt. 2 without Alan Parsons
Take precaution, the percussion is danger
These niggas feelin' anger, like ever since we came up
My circle always come prepared
While other cats is like a plaid shirt, all I see is a bunch of squares
Have a bunch of Leers out in London on stage
Watching hands to the ceiling while rocking in front of fans
Yeah we so in here, so advanced, so far into the future
Copping grands these nigga won't comprehend
This game looks wide open in my eyes
So of course I took it and ran with it like a baton
And passed it to my fam, the legacy lives on
Fuck bein a hundred deep, we're trying to be a mil strong

If this ain't hip hop, like Dickies and flip-flops
Or Phillies and Timbos, the Willies with trimmed fros
Ya'll silly as bimbos and hillbillies, still illy with them flows
My skill really shine like gem stones
In Beverly Hills, feel me?
New sheriff in town, the flair with the sounds
Since rap was lost in the mainstream
But who care if it drowns
My brain scheme is complex like the magazine
Swagger's mean like gang related rags and jeans
Tag a scene, smack machines, make the maggots lean
I drag machines like blunts from outta bags of green
On Dud's stash! So playa I pull the stud's math
Those in power get golden showers and bloodbaths
In shitstorms, I spit thorns and pierce through
The nearest crew, who never knew I was fierce, but
Fear is true with the clearest view
They grim and hate, and imitate what they hear us doin'
Immolate, I'll demonstrate how their spear flew
To higher ground and came down like a parachute
For fucking with me, Royce, Black, and June
We'll lay you on your back in black lagoon

If this ain't real hip hop
What the fuck is it then?",https://genius.com/Royce-da-59-real-hip-hop-lyrics

No goin back with him; cause holmes actin like
He got Capone backin him (why?) He's gone platinum
WOW, I'm hurt, cause now his words
Cause now he famous 'bout as down to earth as it rains the worst
My value will grow with my next release
CUT THE CHECK, I suggest you invest in extra ink
My next album should raise the brow of every man, woman and child
And today, I gotta get paid
You got a sign on your door that says ""Keep Out""
I can't fire no more, I can't reach out

My last favor to ask you was when, ""Don't do me no more favors""

Can’t Nobody Stop Me,UnKnown,2003.0,"From as far back as I can remember
Me and my man vicious
We was always taught to shoot for the stars
The game is ours!
Now y'all see it...

Can't nobody stop me (Uh-Uh)
No way to stop me (Uh-Uh)
Can't nobody stop me (Uh-Uh)
Ain't no way to stop me (Uh-Uh)

As long as the checks stay ill
And the records stay real
I will definitely never see how 2nd place feels
I'm a striver
I learned from my father
To burn like lava
I am a survivor
The problem is that
Even as a kid
I would lean to the beat of
Air to the chair of the kings
And I vow to myself that
I wouldn't help
I will rise to the top but empower myself
Can't nobody stop my wealth
My dreams are ?? without my help
For sure it's better than chains on
Or pure competitive nature, waitin'
For the day, we make plans
To compete, win or lose shake hands
These are the views of the dudes
Of tomorrow who will win
Cause they shoot for the stars
And REFUSE to LOSE


As long as the checks stay ill
And the records stay real
Imma definitely never see how 2nd place feels
Got the mind of a rhymer
Conquer your roster
Squad full of monsters as hungry as a hostage
Yeah, I will never fear cause I need to succeed
You can tell in my stare that I care
If I lose I'm a winner
So I move from the vision
Never fool with the ??
Rather learn from my missions (COME ON!)
Can't stop my mission
Two vicious for you
Who step into the trenches
Raw talent never back down
Bring the challenge, imma leave standin'
Laughin' at y'all faces
Cause y'all mad
But dirty looks, will never shake this man
Forced through my head for the cake for the bread 'til I'm fed
Go hard at 'em all
And REFUSE to LOSE


As long as the checks stay ill 
And the records stay real 
I will definitely never see  how 2nd place feels 
To lead  the team 
Fatigue  Breathe 
We'll lead you to song (COME ON!)
For sure it's better than chains on 
Or pure competitive nature 
You can lose your shoes 
In the cruise to bruise 
Go hard at 'em all and refuse to lose

Jockin’ My Fresh,The Bar Exam 2,2008.0,"Quit jockin' my fresh
Chorus:
Easily I approach
The microphone because I ain't no joke
Tell ya momma to get off of my nuts
She need to quit
""Jockin' my fresh"" - Jay-Z
Easily I could smoke
Your hypertone, nigga you ain't no loc
Tell your girlfriend to get off of my dick
She need to quit
""Jockin' my fresh"" - Jay-Z
Verse One:
I'm on fire survival, admire you liar
Who higher, new tires, flew by you
Dubai ya, Brunei ya, the new sire
Each line, I think it's lightning
What you think is writin'
Is my ink ignitin'
I stole that from L
But I don't think it's bitin'
Beef is heightened on side of the stage
Speakin' of fightin'
I write like I pull my pen out the side of a grenade
Imperial, serial killers in front of a mural of 
Dilla, Proof, Blade
A burial crusade
Venereal, flu, A.I.D.S
I'm sick
I'm too paid
I'm rich
I will flower a chicken like a bouquet
I'm sentimental
End up with your dental
Loose cave
Bitch we ain't Friends;
I ain't Phoebe Buffay!
I'm a motherfuckin' 
Superstar like Lupe
Get a lot of vagina
Stylin' like I'm a designer
Whoever hotter than me
I probably find him and sign him
He Connected, I probably supply him, it's eeeeeasy
Chorus
Verse Two:
The product is like Prada
A lotta shottas'll stretch you
Until you tired of violence I'm the rider bitch y'all the liars
Y'all retired your guns just cause you signed a deal
I'm the Youth Fountain on Truth Mountain on Honest Hill
Who's countin'?
I'm tryin' to build beyond a mill
Don't call me seven nine's cause I'm tryin' to find a bill(ion)
True is, who is down to kill
Old school like a Buick Bonneville
Suicide, do a lot of pills
Who you gotta to kill
Beef is easy to me bitch
Guns, grams, get 'em, got 'em all, strict G shit
Honestly, round 'em up, found 'em slumped
Down a buck, llama tucked
Grind till you tired of us
I'm on your head like a Yarmulke
Chorus
Outro:

Quit jockin' my motherfuckin' fresh. Number two

You Don’t Know Me,Build and Destroy,2003,"Money.. and murder..
This is life, understand me
You don't know me
Nah.. nah.. nah

Niggas got the wrong views on this long uz'
I'm nothin to prove, while you bluffin I use, I'm gon' shoot
As far as life, I've been lied to, looked down upon
I had fights, too many to count 'em all, I'll round them off
I been shot at, went back and got the drop on hoods
Never been robbed, knock on wood, I don't buy that
Yo the streets is in you, we make Scary Movies
No beefs to be continued, only Sequel is lonely and peaceful
It's funny to see, niggas wanna be like me
Who like me? Who represent the D like me?
Fuck the scribbles, I get right to the drawin
My head's on straight, I know right where I'm from, and right where I'm goin
Gimme one hit, per summer money come get - take it, it's yours
Who's the king? Mummy un-stitched, the ruler
The one and only, fuck the pesos, now that we work
That's only a tenth of the dollar I'm worth - you don't know me

You don't know me, you just know what you hear
This is nothin you heard, it's just somethin you know when you hear
Just makin you know when you hear, it's over this year
I could even be phony, you don't know me (naw)

I'm hot though, disagree? You do not know
About the streets, or the rap, you just macho
I won't stop - every broke nigga got a opinion
For every dollar he don't got; fuck them
Some of these niggas hatin me in my own city, but fuck them too
I'm only here because of y'all niggas, so what sent you?
I'm only wishin niggas'll stop dissin
And pay attention to that little dot on the mitten I live in
I don't compete, I teach
First lesson - I'mma show the competition how to get beat
It's easy, you don't know me (no)
You act raw, but is it really you?
Look, just gimme my money, that's all I ask for, I'm chillin
I got lessons to tell, I rhyme like I'm desperate as hell
He who prevails will always keep records for sale
No matter what the case is
I blew the fuck up, and now I'm back to rub it in the faces of haters
You don't know me


You might not like, you gon' respect it
Cause I flows 'til I'm restless, I keep stressin who the best is
You don't know me homie; you'll never hear
A real nigga's name in my mouth, I talk about the phony only
Y'all missin the fact, that figures I'm paid
And I'm still itchin to scratch a wack nigga, now that's dedication
As long as rap's as segregation, I can only speak for myself
And all I can tell you is you don't know me (naw)

Fly like the ghost of who died cause the coke done it
Clean like that Maz' that I got in my garage
When that 'rati rides up (Ahhhh), you gon' know it's not a Mazda
I zone better than you cause I exercise with my hoes
But my trigger finger got it's own regimen
I'm so sick like Ne-Yo I got my own medicine, I do my own edits
C'mon, you know if your crib ain't got no echo, let go you ain't a star
I let go and send bullets like petrol into your car
Put your stunner shades on fix your eyes to look at me
I'm standin but still but yeah my chain is doing the Watusi
Why the fuck they spend so much on those - why wouldn't we?
Plus I'm tired of niggas talking bout what I shouldn't be (yeah)
Put the tools to 'em put the magnum in gear
Then, sing the blues to 'em let them things cruise through 'em (blao)
Believe you me I be squeezing that E-Uey, niggas will bleed
Better breathe, you might re su me
That's the resume nigga, don't it seem roomy?
Don't it read long? Don't my name got a ring to it?
Like a ringtone patterned after King Kong
Adam Eve, battle rappin, tabernacle theme song
That's cause I'm a natural, striking like I'm lightin matches
I could west, south, Midwest or bite the Apple
Psychopathic, when he on the track it's like it's magic
The city on his back just like his jacket (Woooo!)
The gats that we pack got extensions attachments
Put away your pencils and pens if you rappin
You ain't gotta write rhymes you could have 'em all in your head
I'll read 'em off the floor when you dead (yeah)
Most lyrical I am in a category with none
Compare me to who? If it ain't the Notorious One I'm buryin' you
Cause squeezing ain't shit, my guns be speakin to players like Stephan A. Smith
And believe me they spit, however you want it
I put up them numbers every season that's the reason they sick (keep goin)
I don't pop a lot of bologna, the parkin lot I shot up your homie
I rocked a lot of Prada, lot of Brioni
We only rock shoes once and give 'em to my niggas (uh huh)
While you still cleanin yours and stickin your socks in 'em (yeah)
Im just a hot nigga, them Glock triggers givin you riga'
Broadway and I'm all day like a city slicker
You bigger than me I still get you, I'm so shiest'
I ghost write if I wanted I could let Diddy dis you (keep goin)
Come through your city like the six is a tanker van
Have them killers show up to the scene like the anchorman
And they'll give you the news without the down payment
Up comin rapper was slain but he is now famous (uh huh)
Etch out you, blow your chest out you
Next album no need to know the rest bout you
While you in the air killed just hoverin there chillin (What you doin?)
In the Hilton in Paris fuckin with Paris Hilton (Damn!)
Your little bro at the podium reading goodbyes
I'm getting blowed by a ho in a V Dubai
To prove my worth I did my dirt, the most you can do to the ghost is kill my curse
The most you can do to me now is steal my work
You still can't touch it I'm dope, just feel my verse (keep goin)
My artistic thought process is all twisted
The raw shit I thought of came from awe disses (yeah)
The object of narcissism the sharp weapon
I start guessin 'em all guess that I'm autistic
Preach! Nigga my speech is reachless, untouchable by any livin creature
Any way I'll meet you (yeah), anywhere I'll beet you (yeah)
Bed time to headline or anywhere I feature (uh huh)
Niggas ain't tryin to hit nickel up to do songs (Naw)

You wet you ain't the sprayer
Fuck what ya TV say
Them ain't no real D niggas snitchin on DEA
The topic of your discussion is my release date
Bottle after bottle I drink till I can't see straight
Niggas quit askin me questions about Ca$his
As long as he's still signed with my nigga Shady, he's straight
I ain't got no problem wit him, but I will promise this
Next nigga throwing my name around I'mma kill him
I got a lot to spend, spent so much time putting cheese on my enemies
I forgot to watch my friends
Thought I was already covered until I found out
My nigga Tre Little was loyal as R. Kelly's brother
They say you talk about rappers whatever you do
I like to talk about pussy like Devin The Dude
Getting this shit is fun
Me you don't expect to run
Ain't gotta respect me, just don't disrespect my gun
I came in and dude fled from the boxing match
He ran like a huge head in a stocking cap
You little niggas keep cool
Cause I eat dudes
When I see you shrimp niggas all I do is seafood/see food
Lord, fuck a boss I'mma God
Parked outside a muthafucka's house ain't a homicide
Them niggas you got in your car say they down to ride
His tongue cool, but evidently his Llama tired
BOP
Y'all can doubt me
This long legged clip walking out be the only thing POP about me
Who could stop me?
I hit him like I'm Luca Brasi
So many bitches on my dick nigga Luke would jock me
Who the sickest shit to spit?
Is it me or is it triggers?
Cause you ain't comparing me to any nigga
Any Wayne, any Jigga we can bang
Any figure we can bet
I will slang any nigga you can check
Who the best?
Now until any volunteer DJ wanna give me play
Meantime you can sweat
I come to your set
Nigga I don't give a fuck
You Raisin Bran ass niggas sound shriveled up

Balls of the outlaw, hanging out the draws
Of the dark blue house, y'all
Standing and rambling with all of that mouth y'all
Got hit, shot with the cannon when I'm standing up and going all out for
Phantom of the opera, sitting in the Phantom
In the parking lot, examining how I keep my name out y'all mouth
I drop names like Game,
 but I don't mean say 'em
I mean spray 'em, they drop, brrt, ha
I have a nigga blistering quicker then chicken pox
In a box in a river sitting stiffer than six o'clock
Knock, you can't see me, labels you can't sign me
You can either Jay-Z me or JV me, get it?

Yeah, Nickle ain't going nowhere, yeah
I ask who want it, nobody, say yeah

Rinky dink labels still tryna make me offers
You don't wanna tear me off, you will only scare me off

Each and every artist y'all got, I want 'em
So run 'em, they don't wanna fuck with me then I'll gun 'em
So don't get me started
'Cause lately I been on my Black Eyed Peas and Q's and it's gon' get retarded
Fees for shoes, Evisu jeans breezing through
Leaving your team green and blue

Beef without blasting, P without Havoc

Sitting on enough classic tracks that could fill up a 40 gig Apple

Plus I'm a teacher, niggas play hard
But I'm way harder 'cause I can keep it up like Levitra
Big dick, I could fit you up my urethra
Sick spit like I must've been touched by Jesus
Like I must've been groped by a diva
Or fucked by a model
Nope, you ain't been approached by either
You standing where ya mans is at
I'm on stage getting paid controlling where y'all hands is at, get it?
Got it

Roll all the way over, respectfully hate me, you best to behave
I'm seven dollars a record makin' heftier pay
Can you realize platinum artist buck by buck, is that what you say?
200 thousand sold compared to the average platinum rapper
Couldn't afford, what I blow on all my taxes
'Cause I own my own masters, own my own catalogue
Ain't tryna be old talkin' 'bout ""Oh, I had it all""
So it's mo' money, mo' albums, add 'em all
The scanner that seal is the reason I feel like a man of steel
Still standin' 'cause I'm still scannin'

We rollin? Aight..
I mean, I been through a lot man
Tommy Boy thing, the bootleggers
You know, life goes on, so what?
You gotta reach deep down in your heart, and pull out as much as you can
To get through what you goin through
I'm living proof

Way down DEEP in the heart of a man who was DEEP
In the palm of the hands of the truer streets
Lives a - nigga who gives a, lyrical nigga the shivers
Step up and get hit cause him or his fifth'll deliver
His mouth is a gun, the cannibal speaks
You need to do more than floss to handle the teeth
And shame on it - only thing that pops out
Whenever your Glock's out is a stick, and a flag with ""Bang!"" on it
His flow's out-grown his dreams
Out of a count that he beams out-of-towners and hold down home
You niggas showin up, with a lot of the same soldiers
I'm rollin up, pushin her outta your Range Rover
You decided to be a rider but why, would you do it
When you know you could light up my saliva like lighter fluid
Soak with writin; cause 5-9 is back
And he's about to spit thunder and shit lightning!

Uh-huh, you thought I was done didn't ya?

My crew never call me for beef - NO! It never happens to me
That's like callin a SWAT team when it's a cat in a tree
It's too many reasons, to tell you NIGGA please
You can do nothin with me, like weed with too many seeds in it
I'm more - vicious, it gets - more pathetic
You testin somethin more than a medic nigga or mortician
I'm more than rap, I will RUSH you
For the sacks like Warren Sapp, like nigga FUCK you
I'll STUFF you in a Atlanta mansion
Paint the wall with you on ""Candid Camera,"" like I'm a phantom answered
Demand a ransom; cause a fire at your momma's house
And take all of the tires off of the ambulances
Of course the track, fits Mr. King

Hope my team win eventually cause I'm the last cowboy

And only yourself when ya being childish

This my nigga Blade right here (you could call me Icewood)

Icewood? (Icewood) I could
Go home witchu baby if the pipe good

We get a whole lot of scrilla, fo'-fives is wit us
Whole flight can fill us, Globetrotter nigga
When you see a plus sign in front of like twelve numbers
On your cell that's me calling to tell you
That I ain't at home (yeah)
I'm witnessing the midnight sun in Finland with the big robe on
With six different funds
Kronas, Pesos, Euros, the list goes on
We send henchmen to wet ya
In between trips to the Philippines with strippers wit us
Bet chips on Pistons, gassed off Sheed (yeah)
Yelling pass the ball to Rip and Billups, mami

If you got love for me, then do your little dance for me
Turn that ass around, (turn around) and keep doing what you dooooo
If you got a thang for me, then do your thang for me
Turn that ass around, (turn around) cause you've got it coming

Turn that ass 'round, ma you know I'm a clown
Throw a little money 'round, do my dance to the sounds

It's Mr. Blade Icewood the new king of rap
I got these shots for you haters (c'mon)
Tell the waiters bring the shots, use the liquor to motivate her
To hop up in the whip, before she leave the lot
Got my dick between her lips; hand between her hips
On some freaky shit, yeah ain't know I did it like that
She thought it was all rap 'til she screaming on her back
Playa, we send henchmen to wet ya
In between trips to the Philippines with strippers wit us
Bet chips on Pistons, gassed off Sheed
Yelling pass the ball to Rip and Billups, mami


Yeah, we hit makers with acres
We hit Vegas with chips major, we can't just
Ball like the usual team, we stay whyling
Up the challenge, fuck it, tear up the palace
Fuck with, nothing but them trucks with, halogen lights
Did bad in his life, them cuts and calluses
In the G-4, in a suit, eating soufflc
In the seat big get your coupe, nigga go play

Hey come over here!
Well you can have it your way, blow cabbage all day
Ice, everywhere, bought it from all yay
This ain't no spaceship, gave the Rover a facelift
Lift the fifth to my lips while she moving her hips

What up, Miko
Yeah, yeah

I'm feeling it, fill the glass to the top with Moet
Feeling it, feel the Lex' pushing up on the set
I'm feeling it, feel the high that you get from the la
Feeling it, if you feel it raise your L in the sky

Nigga, the Benz is tinted, I'm watching Menace in it
It's so fucking roomy, you can play tennis in it
Ten times out of ten times a ten is in it
Riding with me, if y'all start it up, then I'm finishing it
I stay focused, keep that paper in motion
I keep a long-legged ho on a stroll on 8th and Ocean
Me and her got secrets between us no one knows
It will start snowing in Miami if she blow her nose
I got the hoes, my nigga, they call me Sloppy Joe
Foursomes, fivesomes, y'all party, we rock n' roll
Nigga, your fate will hit you when you aware and you
In the presidential suite that looks like a tornado went through
Two bitches laying with ya, bitches on top of bitches
On the floor, looking like they're sleeping after playing Twister
I'm pissing on the condom floating on the toilet water
Thinking to myself, ""damn, do I really want a daughter?""

I'm feeling it, fill the glass to the top with Moet

I'm feeling it, feel the high that you get from the la
Feeling it, if you feel it raise your L in the sky

Yeah, my nigga
My nigga, Kino, you said you wanted bossy
So here you have it, bossy
Whoo Kid, you got to go ""pow"" to this one

Louie slippers, Prada shoes, the new edition
For my new mistress, the Gucci with the groovy zippers
The Lord is truly with us
I got the Caviar shits, the Fila farts, I got the Louie hiccups
I'm a sprayaholic, what ever way to call it
Pistol of the singles, strippers treat me like I'm made of wallet
But I don't be trickin with them, you can find me sittin with them
Sippin with them, shortly after that, you see me dippin with them
(I'm feeling it) Be the answer
I be on the road looking just like Usher, it just be me and dancers
Til the wheels are rolling, nigga we riding
You ain't gon' see them hoes on stage but they still performing
How you feel in the morning, before these hoes brush their teeth
They like to suck dick without giving a warning
They just met but they don't mind each other
Both of these hoes' breath gotta smell like pussy and condom rubbers (Don't kiss em!)

I'm feeling it, fill the glass to the top with Moet
Feeling it, feel the Lex' pushing up on the set
I'm feeling it, feel the high that you get from the la
Feeling it, if you feel it raise your L in the sky
I'm feeling it, fill the glass to the top with Moet

It's a new era for me, a lot of this shit is new for me
You know what I'm saying, but this is the reason why I feel like I'm the best rapper in the world
Cause I can do what every other nigga can do
Can't none of y'all motherfuckers do what I can do

With the buckshots shells'll turn a nigga into Chinese Checkers

Every time I throw this right hand I knock somethin loose

Call the wife and tell her you're not comin home and to take it easy

At them sissy-ass niggas type to accidentally shoot they foot
Desert Eagle too big for you bitch-ass niggas
Soft-ass palms, can't take the kickback niggas
And you wonder why they suckin my dick
Or why I keep a suitcase with a hundred grand handcuffed to my wrist
Or why the watch could possibly make you lose your sight blinkin
On the wrist, lookin like halogen hazard lights blinkin
Royce 5-9 in this bitch
About to sprinkle gunfire on any snitch

Why you lookin' at me? Hear a nigga
I ain't ya bitch
You don't want a street nigga that have to get wit this shit
Cuz I ain't gon' quit
Til 'em choppa bullet flippin
They spleens, layin' all lower then yo chest or ya chin
Man I'm in it to win
I give a fuck bout a friend
I care more bout the dough, and even more bout the Benz
Niggas look at my chain, then they clutchin' they burners
They think they got us, we ??? finna get ugly this summer
Yeah I roll with a stunna, I got a lot on the line
But still its kill or be killed before a nigga take mine
I give a pass to niggas, when they look at my bitch
Just they admire her walk, or just impress that she thick
I'm reppin' Southside North Memphis nigga, nigga Yo Gotti!
Bricks in the dashboard Benz big body
Royce 5'9"" and them hustles out of Detroit
Get it how we get it cuz they importin' Ex boy


Why you so hard nigga? Pause
I done tried so many times
To get my violent temper to comply with my mature side
But the other side is where the 45 is, hidin'
And I'm fa' sho childish, hi, I'm countin'
1, 2, seeking you niggas with the peace, with the peek-a-boo trigger
When I come, through, with the honorable spirit
Eyes lighting up with shine like the ""Chronicles of Riddick""
Nigga forget it
Nine times outta ten, times' on my side
If your nines in the car, cuz mines on my side
Why you lookin' like dat?
Nigga ain't no hoes here
I'm about to ask the waitress what she put in yo' beer
We can get it on, we can do whatever boy (whatever boy)
Don't you ever push your pedal, pump your brake
Better untwist your face
Spoken word, mixed with school, mixed with crunk
This should hit you, get you pump, if it get you drunk
It can get you jump!


Bitches trip, niggas quick
To pull out they chains on sight
Niggas flip, soon as they announce my name on the mic
So I, gotta kinda watch them niggas
You know them niggas roll up beside you
You don't know if they like your car, they don't like you
By the way they lookin', you can't tell if they grimmin' you or admiring you
Whether envy you when they see your tires spinnin'
So you greet 'em as polite-
Ly as possible, that nine sit on yo lap, be disrespectful then you leave 'em at the light
Hit that window and squeeze that toaster
Pull off fast and I promise
That I just put his Regal in 3-wheel motion without havin' hydraulics
I call it like I see it
Walk it like I did it
Nigga coughin' up yo kidney
Cough, talkin' bout the kid
My people, I came expectin' the same kinda respect that you want
Some of you steppin' in something by coming and testing it once
They won't let you do nothin' unless you cutting a check
Let me ask you a couple a questions, nigga

You punks got a 50/50 chance of livin, you playin Rock Paper Scissors
Why the FUCK would I knuckle up witcha?
I got twin Glocks from Scotland, I'd rather Double Dutch witcha

Same nigga that be changin quick when they see brains
We ride in streets with Mafia ties
We pop up by surprise like we playin +Hide-And-Go-Seek+

God is it, possible the same niggas
That's winnin in Dodgeball will grow up and dodge bullets?
The funky little, two squares
In this concrete jungle was shootin the Monkeys In The Middle
If you compare me to anyone in this game
If it ain't Shyne or Beans then it's Truth Or Dare
I been this hollow inside for years
Leave peers beside beers that'll Spin The Bottle
Don't think that e'ry night seem right
Nigga just look beside you, I'm at every Red Light, Green Light
Ready to stop you, fatally
I'll leave bullets inside your truck the size of Hot Potatoes
A comparison's vital - you ain't nobody
Royce 5'9"" is Simon, the Americal Idol


Yeah, yeah, now he's had the luck as
The same dumb fuck that took toes to the morgue for Freeze Tag
Miss the clock is tickin away
At the pick of the day the hot shot, let's play Hop Scotch
Let's teach all of these punks
That we as venomous as snakes, you can be them Leap Frogs and jump
I'mma make 'em all drop and say ""Ahh""
I'm the king of the playground, I make 'em say Father May I
You should say Grace - cause even if you
Bring your own pencil to the game nigga we don't play Breaks
Now you gon' find your fitted
In the Lost & Found cause you crossed your bound nigga Hide and go get it

King of Detroit,Build and Destroy,2003,"Shoot wit us...
(x2)
You gon' need a lot more guns to shoot wit us
A lot more jewels to floss wit us
It's gon' take a lot more power to fuck wit us
And a lot more niggas to buck wit us
You gon' need a lot more guns to shoot wit us
A lot more jewels to floss wit us
It's gon' take a lot more power to fuck wit us
And a lot more niggas to buck wit us

I'm the King of Detroit, I'm the King of the Kings
The King of the ring, cause y'all niggas be swingin the sting
I'm doin my thing, you only worth TWO of my rings
It's you and my team, at war for tryin to ruin my reign
Imagine a thought of that
It's Motown, it's where this black music shit started at
All I did was brought it back
Get it right, I'm over your block and I must succeed
I don't know how much you need, but it's more than you got
These niggas rippin and robbin with the fifth in the closet
Cause y'all niggas ignorant logic got you slippin and dodgin
We bring to a violent halt whatever beef we have
I hate losing, so you'll probably never see me mad
Just here to rewind it back to where time had begun
It's the size of the gun, the trigger and the nigga behind it
I'm the King of the throne, I stood up to sing you a song
To get the platinum plaques back to the city, bring it home

You gon' need a lot more guns to shoot wit us
A lot more jewels to floss wit us
It's gon' take a lot more power to fuck wit us
And a lot more niggas to buck wit us

You welcome to floss and receive a consecutive loss
All I need's a second to talk to get my message across
Out-of-towners come to Detroit with all they mens
And that's a gamble, you know the house always wins
I'm the savior of rap, y'all wanna be like the third verse missed
Street this, thug that - rhymin my life in first-person
You could never rise, no matter how high it seems
I'm the man with a eye, in the land of the blind of Kings
Trust this, no one could touch this - the difference is
The average nigga brings it to jail, that's why I bring it to justice
My shit be well-thought out, y'all niggas just writin a rhyme
That's why most of the time you bitin a rhyme
I'm simple and plain, quick to speak a nigga in vain
Cause niggas done changed, it's very few niggas with brain
Speak from your heart, and I aim for your chest, I'm done wit it
Y'all rap niggas want your respect? Then come get it

You gon' need a lot more guns to shoot wit us
A lot more jewels to floss wit us
It's gon' take a lot more power to fuck wit us
And a lot more niggas to buck wit us

Yo, yo, yo.. we must, represent for us
Cause where we from, we eat, sleep and shit Detroit and that's us
Y'all slide by, side by the real niggas
Ain't nothin but stand by to get killed niggas - what!
Tryna make the most of this time, we ain't inside forever
This is life, nobody makes it out alive - NEVER
I'm the King of the throne, I stood up to sing you a song
To get the platinum plaques back to Detroit, bring it home

You gon' need a lot more guns to shoot wit us
A lot more jewels to floss wit us
It's gon' take a lot more power to fuck wit us
And a lot more niggas to buck wit us
You gon' need a lot more guns to shoot wit us
A lot more jewels to floss wit us
It's gon' take a lot more power to fuck wit us

The ice watch on the sleeve of the white collar
Leanin' like the Pisa tower, he's in power
Standing on top of the black bottom
You should pack up now that the dirty glove is with me
Take your hat off inside of the mitten when you spittin'
Cause you could get it for sure
Your whole rap clapped up out you
If I don't get you back up
Got you in a morgue sittin' stiff in a drawer
Niggas I can't be caught, I can't be bought
They call me the anti-corp, anti-talk
Antsy, when it comes to gettin' the kind of hugs
That come from a fake thug
That show me a sign of love
Who am I to judge but you would not out of love
Walk up if I was washed up like the tsunami floods
I ain't tryna' to bug

While he drinkin', spark him 'til he leakin', coughin' Remy Martin

Royce five nine is a prophet, in every sense of the word
Superb finisher, administer words like ministers
The tall tales of the low sales of a poet
Centuries rolled up in the pen that he holds up
He holds it the holy grail, when he sold his soul
He was since told his flow's, the Da Vinci code decoded
Since chosen, he prays harder
But every time he spot a rival revolvers inside
His bible like, Gregory Hines with the rage of Harlem
Po-po's call the, team Freon, we so cold
Red like beam be on sight, we got weed neon green
We got A1 yay, Celine Dion white, breathe
Your last breath, you about Five Heartbeats away from death
Cause you the Leon type, so muahh

I did Green last night with my comraderies
I spit a verse that you heard, this my apology
At the exact same time this is a fuck you
Suck my nuts you ungrateful fuck you
Haha
Alchemist in the building
Throwback, feel like I'm rappin' it for the pilgrims
Uh, I'm an animal with the talkin'
A grammar gargantuan with Satanic arson
Words that'll exhume Dilla
Bring his body back to life, toss Charles Hamilton in his coffin
Your man is a liar, he dead wrong
Write ""pyromania"" on his headstone, he playin' with fire
The shark flow sink ships and eat the survivors
The Takeover mentality, Ether saliva
You dead, you only trying to do this to a degree
I am the AIDS, nobody wants to do it with me
This is my job as king of my city
The Hex Murda, Tricky/?? committee
I don't know a girl that say ""stop""
I drink till I got the kind of buzz that Drake got
Holdin' the torch, show no remorse
My group murder beats and I creep back and I flow over the corpse
This a big ass gang
The only thing me and T-Pain got in common is a Big Ass Chain

Nigga, your brains will be on your lap
Throw a stone I'mma throw a meteor back
Don't let media soup you
Niggas will shoot you
My gun makin' my waist look as big as a tutu
Niggas want it, the less thug
The beta drum sound like I'm runnin' with ?uestlove
Ask niggas do they got any requests?
Before I let 'em know they ain't got any respect
Uh, why call Joey a trouble maker?
If you ain't callin' me his trouble ender
Do you know how big my dick is?
My bitch say I should start me another gender
I got muscle, I'm rollin' around muscular
I'm so cut throat I could grow me another jugular
Niggas shit face
Cause in my time
I touch more classics than my nigga Joell did on his mixtape
Uh
Niggas is weak anyway
Tell Amber Rose she can cheat on me any day
Uh
3-2-3-6-4-0-2-0-2-1 baby call me
You be fuckin' with wack niggas
A whole crew full of earthy ass rap niggas
Uh, I got a squad full of rap killers
I'm the living proof that God is a crack dealer

I've been morbid, I'm important
I talk fly than enforce it while in orbit
I'm pretty but I've been gorgeous
Been on my Ben Gordon
(Y'all catch that?...never mind)
The whole Slaughterhouse will step to you
We ain't no motherfuckin' group we a wrecking crew
Don't worry about it hip hop, we here to rescue you
We feel like we the best, fuck all the rest of you
And we'll come and get you, go 'head, spit a bar
You got heart until your heart is in a pickle jar
The untouchable squad that dares nothing but ??
You are fuckin' with gods, don't look fuckin' surprised
I fuck bitches with jobs, addicted to dick
And cleaning and eating more pussy than Missy Misdemeanor
I see why your whole hood embarrassed
You keep playing the same god damn character, Wood Harris
My daughter is an heiress, my son is an heir
I pray lookin' down, shootin' guns in the air
Uh, put some fuckin' money on it then
Cause he gon' kick it till he got your blood on his shins

Unless I'm in Hollywood, gold spoken
My shit kicks the loudest, my chick's kicks is Prada
The big body Benz is sick, kicks is Bravis
Switch out and tell the Impala, to sit high as a big dick toddler
Bitch, get dollars, I don't kick knowledge, I quit college for hip hop
If I get violent, you probably should kick rocks
Verbally vivid, lyrically clear
Snitches shouldn't be murdered
They should just be livin' in fear
They should just be raped, no homo

But nowadays wildin' Roman roamin' should do as I do

I'm the nice right hand Ruger specialist
Turn 'em into twins and I'll appear ambidextrous
Simultaneous, back and forth trigger movements
He bleeding profusely
I've executed my execution
I got knowledge but I like violence and loot
Type to go to college
Not to learn, just to shoot a student
Kid Vishis
Nothin' fictitious
Talked your bitch into believing my seed is nutritious
(Delicious ha ha ha)
Yep, then you went and kissed her like it don't matter
She went and swallowed my baby batter
You sick!
I know you been a bitch
I hate you worse than fans hate Joe D. for pickin' Darko Milicic
I got a killer spit
River current flow
I'm as vicious as a pit
You a reappearing ho
Sho' nuff I gotta go
Bruce Leroy to these decoys
Deep speech, each beat I seek and destroy
D-Boy
The city's prince, I'm really convinced
I'm up
To being as sick as Two Girls In A Cup (yuck!)
I leave these wack MCs alone
They won't be in it long
They only got so much time like a minute phone
Bring your lyrics home
Find you with your spirit gone
Outlined and scribbled
My nine spiral period
Idiot
I'm on some Frank Nitty, big willie shit
Bout his bread
Bout he get you dead and I'm serious!

Delirious
Beats be the eeriest
Hand on my balls
The Boyz N The Hood know my style like Furious
I fight dirty
I'm Ike scurvy
I'll slap a bitch
It's obviously like blood on a white jersey
Don't go and have an accident
Christ Passion-ate
You little boys invite me to spaz
I'm right on your ass
I Mike-Jackson-it
My bitch Nina Ross constantly looking for pussy
You don't push me that pistol is dyke accurate
The lights flashin' in the night from the chain
Like it's lightening
Bitches suckin' up to me
My life is a Dyson
The chicken with me is a knockout like she a Tyson
But like she enticing
Bright like the ice in a Breitling
The Feds buggin' like I'm lice
Whenever we chop it up
Like I'm dicin
And I gas like I'm nitrous
I'm on top like I'm icing
What you not nice is
The block price is higher than the rock pipe is
George Bush that button like the Iraq crisis
I'm Ted Dibiase
I cop it
It's not priceless
Insane in the membrane
I'm sittin' on top of Sugar Hill like AZ but I'm not Cypress
You got a light for the blunt?
Fire up
Call me Poppa Big Willie/pop a big wheelie like the bike front tire up
Me and Vish nigga
We in tip top shape
Myspace
I stay in a bitch top eight
The only question I ask you bitch niggas is, ""Why hate?""
The handle on the pistol is pearly like God's gate
Y'all niggas sound fishy but you're really squad bait

If I ain't never been robbed by niggas, I won't be
If I ain't keepin it real wit niggas, I won't win

Defeat glory, rather it's deep stories or helluva quotes
Never below, better than dope, off to the side
Watchin' you play games like the veteran coach
If what you spit off the top's never been wrote
Then why you all punchlines, you tellin' a joke?
I'm never right, you'll forever be the best
I'll never be less than the best
Physically Christ, you guessed cuz never it's like
Equivalent to forever twice
The exception to the word perfection
I'll never be broke, if I ain't sellin' you rap, I'm sellin' you coke
Just when you thought I couldn't get better, I spoke
And sendin you back to the lab
What would you equal after the math, I'm tellin' results

If I ain't never been dissed by niggas, I won't be
If I ain't never been robbed by niggas, I won't be
If I ain't keepin' it real wit' niggas, I won't make it

I'll be hated, takin' rap to where it's never been taken
Say ""never say never"" but never's forever mistaken
I'm hopin to change my name, get spoken in vain
Niggas is broke in the game, still hopin' for change
You ain't feelin' me, you feelin' energy
Instantly sent
Lettin' you know I'm the epitome of what the shit'll be
Hater-proof resistant, say the truth
Ain't nobody like mines, you try to bite mines and break a tooth
We stay on the outside the chalk lines
Leavin you inside outlined, try to doubt mines and you can die
Just think if the game had no Royce
It be niggas wit fame and fans that should hate him but have no choice
I'm blowin' so much I'm glowin'
All throughout my camp is showin'
They all my niggas that I trust cuz' I know em
We movin' toward the cheddar, the more the better
So when you say ""never"" make sure it's forever, (what)

The Throne is Mine,Build and Destroy,2003,"* hidden bonus track; written by Royce for Dr. Dre

I can't cater to y'all cause I'm greater than y'all
Baby, I'm like an alien invadin to y'all
Crews, I done proved to all of you's I'm thorough now
(What?) I used to want an island (what?) I want the world now
Dre runnin for king, street politician
Beats one of the things I peeped y'all to listen
Peep how I did it, I took the rap game
Fans came and I established the campaign
Damn shame how all you haters can mud sling
Debatin with the press on the slate that I rubbed clean
Most of y'all wanna be loc, that bugs me
Claimin you thugged out and don't know what a thug means
I'mma shine so long as the sun should burn (what?)
I was meant for the throne from the sperm to the urn (what?)
I don't care what y'all gotta say behind us
Just remember me, Dr. Dre your highness - sing

It's my kingdom, the throne is mine
I'm back to reclaim what I own this time
Let it be known, engrave it in stone this time
I'm here to rule alone this time - what?

Yo, emperor dressed in a robe, iced down
Emeralds and rubies up in the ice crown
It's like a dream full of upcomin events
My wife is a queen, my son is a prince
Tryna breathe life in the heart of this dead market
Walkin on top of y'all, on top of the red carpet
Paid dues, give the world somethin to bump
Make rules with my shoes curled up in the front
Any bad feelings for me toward you sounds fatal
Discussin your death with knights of the Round Table
Passed y'all kids, did what y'all did
Switch the Masion into a castle and drawbridge
A servant for any purpose, Scottish ones
If she see me dressin myself, she probably run
All you hoes callin want us to rap more
Act-ors can fall under the trapdoor
I don't care what y'all gotta say behind us
Just remember me, Dr. Dre your highness - sing


Y'all niggas wanna see me fail, don't y'all?
Naw it's aight, tell the truth - y'all wanna see me fail, don't y'all?
I keep heat, yo that's just me bein me
And why you wanna see me and peeps, it beats me
I thought I represented better than ever before
It must be cause I used the tec instead of the sword
I'm the type of cat that'll slice a cat
But, you can only do so much in the knife attack
I'm badder than savages and the rest of the vultures
Mad rappers is like court jesters and jokers
I'm the king now and while the rest of you's loc'n
At ""The Chronic"" tour with tapes beggin to open
Remember this - all you niggas in jeans and hoodies
Either run with me and the team or runnin to me
I don't care what y'all gotta say behind us
Just remember me, Dr. Dre your highness - sing


It's my kingdom, the throne is mine
Back to reclaim what I own this time
Y'all know - I'mma engrave it in stone this time
I'm here to rule alone this time - what?
It's my kingdom, the throne is mine
Back to reclaim what I own this time
I told y'all - I'mma engrave it in stone this time
I'm here to rule alone this time - what, what, what?

Comin' up next is the incredible!
We takin' it back to the beats and the rhymes!

5'9"" is back, about to make a nigga spin on his back
Not on a cardboard, on the ground with people surroundin'
Lookin' down at him; lookin' astounded
Ready to draw 'round him an outline of his body in chalk form
This nigga here let the trigger talk for him
His niggas'll bark for him, for real, his heart's warm
So you've been warned
I don't even need to be drunk forever, the liquor is rootin' me on (go, go, go, go, go!)
I turn tables fast as Jam Master Jay do
I'm N.W.A., I choke hoes like Dre
Poke holes in the pavement, throw foes in the grave
If you could choose between a broke nose or 
the AK
I make movies like Cube 'cept I use hammers
Yep! I shoot but I don't do it with cameras
(Nope!) So you can call me Malcolm
You can all witness what I be doin' to all of these rappers (yes!)
With y'all sloppy tactics; don't try to copycat me
If you ain't tryna box me back
And watch your back, don't take another look into the eyes
Of a nigga that's willin' to ride 'til he blind

Fuck a hook... fuck a hook... fuck a hook...

I will rhyme all day, yes!

I'll show you the back of your brain
Slap you with the back of the gun
Clap you when the rappin' is done
I aim to hit, I pack MACs, accurate ones
Change the clip, I send rappers back where they from
Changin' fast, the game I ask is not a sport
I'm tired of bein' a fuckin' day late and a dollar short
And I'm back! All of you rap niggas hide your mics
I'm ridin', dyin', and I ain't flyin' by on them bikes
I'm walkin', talkin', you eye me you dyin' tonight
This iron is showin' you the shine designed by Christ
And I am the head reaper about the sick shit
You about to see dead people without the ""Sixth Sense""
And yeah, takin' food off my mother's table'll
Get you killed regardless like my brother's label
My heart and arteries a part of me that'll test the truest
We can do it, put your vest into it, yeah

Fuck a hook... fuck a hook... fuck a hook...

Chka-chka-chk
(""You don't wanna play with him today"")
Yeah, No!
Yeah, hardcore! Rhymes galore!
(Oh!) Givin' you what you need!
Like I told you before!

Yeah, the rap game is dead, I'm 'bout to breathe life in it
Bring it back to when niggas was cypherin'
Yeah, back in the day, when nobody needed radio play
I was straight long as my radio played tapes
And this went on before all of them pay dates
We was backflippin' and windmillin' to save face
These days, we'll give you the MAC so stay in your place
I hope before you lay on your back, you sayin' your grace (pray!)
These new cats that rap to me, they groupies
You never see 'em in Max Julius or them Guccis
Or they woulda got robbed for them Diadores
Or the Gazelles, we the store, we take, we sell your
Items we took, have you goin' to tell
(We crooks) we either goin' pro or goin' to jail
I know I'mma spare (many) lives
This rap shit is comin' with me, 'cause don't nobody know how to share

Sway In the Morning Freestyle (PRhyme),UnKnown,2014.0,"Lord have mercy, my goal is only ever been to become a better lyricist
Not to become a veteran, not to become a legend
Just to get better with, time
I used to cut niggas, now all I sever is, ties
I'm not a mogul, I'm more like Moses my flow is apart
From anybody you see, your flow is a farce
The Lord is holding the chalice of blood over my empty vessel
That's under my chest so the whole world can notice a poet at heart
And I reach over to this side, pop a collar for Proof
And I squat down and shoot a shot in the air for Big L
And anybody else who was shot down on a stoop
You lame if all you know is swagger and your flow is average
I'm cut from the same cloth as the cloak that go with daggers
Biggest boss, there ain't no room for me in heaven
I ordered my own morgue with no drawers and no cadavers
About paper without the tree talk, but I embark though
Down the road clairvoyant spitting out my soul until I hear air horns
Until my DJ plays me a Don DeMarco
Shady handed me the baton to run, I took it and slowed down
I took some time to ponder like what am I doin'
Besides undoing what I've done
Or have I become this, another nigga to drop like John's Q son
Or if I become this wild dude who die with nobody's surprise
Like one of Saddam's two sons
Heavy is the head with no crown
Just a mind that can move two tons, times two
They signed you, not me
You got a deal, I got an AK still
So I'd rather Dilla drum like Ma Dukes son
Speaking of moms, my mama told me you one of a kind
Be careful who you're kind to son
They hot for now, but I'm Tucson
Name hold weight, alias built for lasting
The sound of Elliot Wilson laughing is at me
And haunting my rapper conscience
Fear of a fan listening and skipping and going back to nonsense
There goes the genre, it's over
Paul Rosenberg is no longer focused on you
Crooked I been out-thinking me and he still drinking
Marshall telling me don't worry, but he been sober longer
My wrist watch tells a chilling story of frozen karma
It feels like people from my past came together to pray I don't do good

If you love my niggas
I'm saying but, if you only love my niggas
We can make this run, for my niggas
And if you die, hope you'll fly high
(Don't worry baby, I'll make this money for you)

Make me an offer I can't refuse, pistol is wild
Pretty face, no mask, undeniably fit for the job
Bitch wit a heart, ready to thump, money is king
Wit my lap on the throne strokin' a cat, runnin' a scheme

My niggas get high off the reefer, and quick to heat ya
If ya feel ya cold-blooded, I got something to heat ya
It's called a hollow tip, dum, dum, follow clip and numb some
If you don't know the language, then don't speak the gun dun

Eyes like black chips of glass, little wit an unholy light
Ya chances of survival, like a roll of these dice
Execution style, ski-mask, no smile
Throw the ace, in the hidden safe, up under the towel
 + (La Femme Nakita)
We definitely blow, stick wit me, know ya limitations
Speak when spoke up, stay away from the rest of these hoes
You ready to kill (No doubt) these niggas is jerks
Broke niggas wit cheap guns, and triggers that work

If ya pops share my, cli-ker, carry street sweepers
And hit ya more times than the worthless bitch, on ya beeper
Revenge is that bitch, and she won't come lesser than
So if ya hit me, God'll get me and give me breath again, bitch, get it right
 w/ (Pharrel ad-libs)

Niggas wanna see me lying hurt, wanna stain my Hawaiian shirt
Cause I put it out, they supplying dirt
Two German Black bitches, begging y'all to try and flirt
Rude and twins, and all they rock is iron skirts

My bitches got mo's of alley cats, armed wit steel bats
And mo's is stealing stacks, double back, and tally that
When shit go down, don't expect me to run
Never forget dun, two guns, is better than one

This money is golden, low and behold, blowing holes
Through what I'm standing in front of you holding, niggas know
Trench coats in Detroit summers, you gotta mean nigga
Wit long guns, you gon' run nigga, run

If I die nigga, slit my back so my wings can come out
And fly nigga, sky high nigga, age is my gun
If I keep fuckin' her, I might die wit her
If you shoot me and my wings come out, then that's a fly stitcher

Stay on ya toes, I got diamonds to watch, frukit niggas
I took it ol' school, got the 5-9 in the box
Dog, let me catch a nigga eyeing my watch
What I'm firing's hot, just aim, and rely on the dot


Fifty karat link-link, mad cause ya lead kink
Me and my bitch is frozen, regardless to her pink mink
Freeze ya eyeballs, you don't want a part of that
Cardiovascular, VVS heart attack

Would you blast for me, put up the cash for me
Out in the world dodging bullets, become a casualty
For ten bricks shit, twenty-four furs, and ten whips
I flip and sends shit, through bitches appen-dix

For my beach fifty grand, I'm laughing at that advance
I spent that at Dolce, on shirts, shades, and leather pants
Million dollar deals, Lord I'm scared my life's changing
Cupid's cousin, money keeping shooting, wit nice aimin'

It's no sane, this drug game, flourished, niggas transform
And hide into courage, but they blows be malnourished
Let's see who get the furbus, bag annoys ass nigga
Extra, like you surplus

Of life then became the price that we pay

Of the plain old mics and stage before it changed

Enter the new wave of the MC
Who traded his dookie chain in for the latest invention
Like the pager that since then became the two-way
That hangs from the pants of the man of the new day (yeah)
Due to the pop radio play on the norm is debatable
To any song that he do, probably gon' do somethin
On a stage with a goon walkin up on him (yeah)
He came a long way from the boombox on the corner (yeah!)
Plus he quick to mention the Midwest
Little bit of Twist', little bit of West
Mixed with a little East coast mixed with a switch of that FLOW!
From stuffin them tapes with the paper to record
To discussin how major the paper cause the way he records
From the kick in the trunk, to wishin
He can put out a hit, to puttin out hits on punk niggas

The future depends on you if you sterile
What you sold is your soul - to get back in mind
As you watch the climate of rap that's supposed to be cold, get hot

Though common I watched it go from gold to platinum to diamond
I watched watches go from silver to gold
To the back road of behind the platinum and diamonds
Flow thrown like quarterbacks to bomb me
Go like a motor, crawl and I'm goin like BRRRAT when I'm rhymin
And I ain't tryin to look back at my prime when I shine
To say I was one of the best, after retirin
My mind is amazin, findin my way
Around problems, I'm kinda shy in a way
It's a whole lot I ain't say, like I honestly think
I'm in the game that any of these days I'mma be king (yeah)
Most likely the flow like he LeBron James (yeah)
Some time and a condom away, from yo' wifey (yeah)
Those waitin they time with me who don't like me
I pay you no mind like there ain't no line behind me

Doesn't it feel good, to see us make money
Feel good, like everything sunny
Feel good, to see us taking off
Doesn't it feel good to see us war
If they can take it from us at all
And if you breathing (we transform?)

Slow down y'all relax, enjoy this life
Paper stacks, where they at, come on, enjoy this life
I know it's hard when you ballin' from, obstacles
Police, women, haters, it's like impossible
I came along way dog, this shit is hard to ball
Gettin' here for my life, this for all of y'all
Back to the block, and everything good in the hood
Drop ya top, I'm saying, this one's for the hood
Put yo guns in yo stash, you don't need 'em today
Put the ice grills up, you don't need 'em today
All you need is icey rims, the games we play
Attract women, it feels good, just the games we play
They love it dog, thugs still havin' fun y'all
Too hot, summertime, why you tryna brawl
Feels good dog, roll 'til the wheels fall off
Hot Detroit, I'm pretty sure it's hot by y'all

We gon' do it everyday, 'til the summer is over
Yeah not my type, winter or fall

It ain't rocket science, I know you ain't cock no iron
I know who you run behind if them shots is flyin'
I know who the crime, the crook, the lolly gag sets
The rhymes, the book, the hookers who probably have sex
The kinds, the shook ones, the pawns the rook
And how the lines would look, if I'm hooked to a polygraph test
Call me papi, the best, the answer to the solution
To the problem in hip hop, you copy the test
I'm the cockiest catch, you a throw
You the treat at the end of my hook, you the eaten
You a ho, you seem to be 'bout losing
There seem to be parts of my style, lingerin' in your bowel movement
I took the courage and built my own company
I own somethin' that's why I purchased the silk tie
This is words to live by, watch your words
Cause words trigger the trigger herbs get killed by
Shut up it's two shooters, bet I can give you a tip
Get a new whip and set up a new jeweler
Get wet up this .2 2 will, light up your head
And exit your lip and swell up your soup coolers
All your teams involved in things
That enter in your body and end all your dreams
Enter in your shoulder, exit out your ass
Hittin' every organ like a pinball machine

Pompous
Roll with Monsters

On spec I spit thunder and you ain't even seen the storm yet
Lightning in the clouds start a fight in the crowd
Hyper and loud get this mic in devoured spittin my style
Attack all of y'all react on the thought of y'all
Slaughter y'all im calling y'all in fact im black ballin' y'all

Burying the lenient under the gravel salt
The pump handle and barrel for carrying convenience
My odyssey carries the most compare me to Phoenix
Silent heart and light up a star I gotta Venus
Puddle and bomb back
Take cover and all that
And try to not die you not rugged enough
You just shook as soon I step foot in this rap shit
Im a bubble of contact like peroxide touching the cut
Stuck in my raps
Stupid Dominus
Niggas sucking my ass boosting my confidence a buck and a half
I know the game im a train trapped inside a name
And the niggas who taught me yo we ride the same
I shoot crews with the truth and chew lies of change
Speeding on a dragon in an attempt to collide with fame

Im mad so imagine my staff covered in mags and a mask
I give any nigga a half-page raft
Poisonous gas
Cutting your air off in a flash
You want to be dirty MCs and get above dat
If you ain't never heard of Ex Government ask what
Who tough you ain't bad enough to battle with us
You be crushed in the Earth dust
My verse just cuts and cause motha fuckas to spit up shit in the guts
You might wave to cats
I make a nigga bite back since you are world of rap stabber shooter
Perhaps black you smack with tracks that hurt
Act bazurk and get attacked by God Experts

Its because the real niggas getting hot and shit

Im hotter than Lava E Molten
Niggas that sleep gotta be violently woken
And who ever wants to get shitted on
Let do a song
I slip in the zone and rip anything with instruments on
Gonna go throw and bake what ever is out
I can do a song with bone and still have to take letters out
Grown man keep the chrome on hand
Won't stand for no shit quick to take matters into my own hands
You stop violence or violence will stop you
Got crews iller than anybody on your block do
I roll with a white boy that pop truths
Listening to rock tunes to jump in a costume and rob you
The heavy metal assassin that ignites in a full metal jacket
With sliders over the action
Heads is plammy
Facing no lyricism
With creative criticism like Headziz Pammy
If I do an album for you than you gonna die naked
You gonna be in my debt cuz you don't buy records
If your not in the dune then you need not enter
Im eating innocent crews just to feed my temper
So fuck mics
I say sick shit gets crushed on
Get a life or get the one you got tempered

Stabbin your spleen, precise like a javelin team

Lockin it down, and rockin like I'm trapped in the clink
Slappin a freak, trappin every rat or a fink
Fast with the ink, blast you out your hat or your link
Shatter your teeth, every time you chatter or breathe
Unravel your cream, Detroit it's ether that or the bing

Wrap my fingers around your neck and let the chokin start

A flow is a flow, so - lo and behold the art
I listen to you and go, ""ehh,"" on your dopest part
I don't do these open mics, I tear shows apart
Whodie I'm a +Hot Boy+, you get roasted dark
First nigga to hit the flow is smart
Last nigga that hit the flow you 'bout to see him and his folks depart
Bling bling - chain glow in the dark
More flooded with mo' ice, cold-blooded with a frozen heart

I write shit the pen guides it, spittin' harder then ten hydrants
Firing on who tryna take mine, this nigga here
Send you around, let it spin you around on the ground waist high
I'm too authentic, I'll end it soon as you walk in it
Who wanna holla, you get swallowed in a New York minute
And if ya record is Gold, then stay on ya goals
If ya Platinum listenin to me, stay on ya toes
Yo they done it now, I'm over the edge, these niggas wanna stay underground
(Why) that's why the money's over their heads
Undoubtedly rowdy, I'm possibly the hottest since the Rakim odessey
Got niggas saying ""How does he do it""
Ayo I gotta be, cause ain't a nigga hotter than me
Go head lie to me, say you know somebody, and I demolish him
Dead up, I got rhymes to make you shut up
Havin you doubting yourself, as to why you even have your head up
I shit on, every contender I pick on
Cause whenever it's on, I'm comin' wit different levels to flip on
Dope - whether you like it or not
Give off smoke in a cypherin' spot, cause I'm liquid nitrogen hot
You ain't did nothin' I ain't done, if you ever said something dope
I ain't said yet, it's prolly on the tip of my tongue
I've had it wit y'all, tryna bring static and brawl
Either I'ma kill you, or you ain't make me mad at all
Phony-fuck cliques could suck dick, you know only Royce 5'9""
Spit only rough shit, when it comes to the Tony Touch shit
It's over consider this laced, I'll probably be the first nigga
To get a hip-hop quotable on a mixtape

Coke rises, so high with no pride
Wow, we all coppin', that's Blow time
0-5 was so live, but oh my
God, we lost Cochran
That's mo' time
At no time from 0-5 and back
Was I happy we lost tears
Cause we lost B.I.G
And we lost Pac
And we not supposed to be rap beefin' but we all did
Yeah, why do all have to be such a disaster?
For the city, us and D-Twizzy hustlin' backwards
I'd like
To ask Eminem when the time's right
Why did you shut down The Source before I got me my five mics?
At least I got the Quotable
I was just on the road with Proof
At least I got some shows to do
What you supposed to do is
Snatch up who's close to you and
Someone who know what they doin'
Pack up that car with that heat gone and keep on

""Pushin'""
Doin' what you was doin' before
""Keep on pushin'""
If you know what you doin' it for
""Keep on pushin'""
If you at peace or you in a war
""Keep on pushin'""
Just make it through and the world is yours
""Keep on pushin'
Just make it through and the world is yours

Shit gets sprayed; but you can't change that
I was doin that in sixth grade
You can take it to the streets with us
All out war, fuck it, everybody heat could bust


Yo, yo, my attitude done changed since I became a king
I'm a stranger being, rearrangin things
Now that I can afford a Range and rings
I sit and think, I remember when it became a dream
Now I'm livin in it, takin the game
To where it's never even been visited, what's my name?
Royce 5'9"" (who?) hottest nigga in rap
How I'm figurin that? I'm iller than y'all
Plus all my niggas be more realer than y'all
More crooks and way more killers than y'all

Then I appear behind you to remind you with the coupon and two nines
The coupon's the real ya
In for the sales of the product is narcotics
The two nines to kill ya
The two mills represents the two deals
You don't get it then you will
It's over, you niggas over the Dru Hill
We in the mili- terra
Nickel, I'm still the sheriff
I John Doe the flow, I'm from the Dilla era
And I'm guilty of pushing the pen and pencil
What I'm writing, I should be put in the penitentiary
In a sense we push raw, me make blow
It's give or take, you give us cake, we take dough
And our battling ain't in a nigga make-up
It's five G's on your chest like an A-cup
A hundred thousand dollar chain like my face up
Tell Mistah F.A.B. get his cash when he wakes up
Ya niggas sleeping, it's a dead issue
If our issue is bread, you got a dead issue
And I ain't taking about it cause that's a fed issue
Like a vest, write the check or let the lead hit you
Ya ain't getting it, I'm going over their heads
But I ain't dumbing it down cause I'm getting it
Yes, getting it, who you should try to kick it with
You ain't inside of my circle, you probably wishing it
Niggas is eating inside it, it's like Christ-i-mas
It ain't no eating outside it, it's not a pic-i-nic
On top of cream, my whole team be popping things
You niggas got a square circle like the boxing ring
And now you ask who the best rapper
That's a silly question, you should use the X factor
That's like asking Slim Shady who the best cracker
The tec clapping out the hollow tip chest crackers
Straighten your face up, that ain't a diss
I got solaces to feds, that ain't a tip
DA wanna indict me
Because I came in Gucci mane so icy
I got a bitch who will marry who ain't the wifey
I'm the franchise boy, I don't own a white tee
Purp Label, Prada
Hurt me, slay me, nada
Multiple threats on my life, I'm still living it
I'm still hanging in places you ain't visited
I got a bitch I be fucking that's a contortionist
I give her beef, compete, and stick a fork in it
Please, I cum on her spine and watch her lick it up
Spit it out on the table and then sniff it up
Nasty, because she had no daddy
Ya niggas put-putting around with no caddie
Right now, I'm dead wrong
This nine will put your memory on the ground like a headstone
Living legend, physical specimen

My cheese, I'm eatin' like I'm obese but only fatter

I'm Underground like the Railroad, I'm prepared to get ugly
My narrative thug day, can only compare me to drugs
I take a nigga way from him like Jared from Subway
You, could, never ever be on my level
You don't know what you're in
But you're in/urine guns like I took a pee on my metal
Just me and my shuttle
We fly
We go together like my feet and my petal
We ride
How could I not be greatest?
When I got Muhammad Ali boxin' inside me in Vegas
Aye
Haters
I just wanna say this
I know I'm underrated
But I ain't under paid when it comes to makin'

That's right a black man plotting on a black man, see them kind of niggas everyday
Give his whole life to that white girl, I know a nigga right around the way
Come home and give his wife a backhand, I know that it's a motherfucking shame
The truth shouldn't hurt but the truth is abuse, 
The white man's fault, that's our new excuse
Talking 'bout the same white man who didn't want to drink
After you nigga draw eye contact  right out in public
With a bill from looking at a girl that ain't even his girlfriend
Don't be looking at her, she white and you black
Eat a whole meal and give you scraps, and he finna put you in the back

My niggas' killer bees. Y'all nigga smelling like bee pollen
Honey. Don't do it to yourself, dunny
Guess it's my nigga Crooked cause we can hit niggas on Ryker's Island
You can either die or dodge a bullet
Nobody riding but the shotty and me and my hooded. What else is you good at?
Your rhymes is dying
I'm flawless. Call me VVS diamond Ryan
It's how we got the lames
Knock a nigga teeth out of his mouth, have him feeling that Tallahassee pain
Fuck the motherfucking bucket; he can kick the bucket
Booyaka! Booyaka! Finger touching. End of discussion


Sick rap, verbal AR
Pain kickback at the end of every bar
How are you a star when local is all you are
You a starving artist that can't walk through the mall
Cook crack, I don't even cook food
I have my bitch do that, I'm that dude
The '09 ravishing Rick Rude
Let you marry her so I can take her on a honeymoon
And you two goon blog boss
Get you all off, no cost, your loss. We want war
J Hood, you lunch, boy

Ha! Laugh at you. Ain't got the heart to pull the piece and blast, you smaller than my niece
Slaughterhouse affiliate, I'm a beast
I don't write raps, I drop turds on beats
Any random nigga better than Ransom
Blog is bad for your health, you indoubted yourself
You a killer? Nigga, kill. Pussy be a pussy, smells fishy. Make them take the bait
For heaven's sake
I rhyme like i can write rhymes for Weezy like Drake
For the cake I'll battle a savage
Fuck the cops. Show me the green, I'll bring malice
He trying to drop Hip-Hop, I'm trying to grab it
From your ringtone rappers, fake Gs and faggots
I know I ain't the baddest, true. My brother Smack Man'll have you bagged in the trash
Trying to burn me and get your ass whooped
Fast as DJ VLAD calling Ross a turn piece
Call the ambulance, he couldn't stand a chance
357 in hand doing a hammer dance
Take a nigga back like the Hammer pants, watch ya life get took from you like Hammmer's mansion
Rip up Bum C fright
Cold enough to swallow the sun and bring night
Sneeze light, fight through the cypher just to steal your pen, pad and your mic
Not a killer but bullets change ya life like Erykah Badu, pussy",https://genius.com/Royce-da-59-hottest-in-the-hood-lyrics

Come too close, I'm closing the curtain
Tomorrow, pick the album up, Death Is Certain
Yes indeed, you know how we be
Holding it down, off the top, Basement booth on BET
I used to be out rapping on JLB
With my whole fam in the D repping the 313
Okay, this is never written down
Today, tomorrow, it's all never spitting now, hey

This tool that I use on all of your peeps
I call it my heat cause I use it when I lose my cool
It's too risky to collide
With who's sitting on the side of your new whip with a huge pistol
The huge clip, thinking out of the bottom
The size of out of a bottom's clip
Every goon you got will be hit
Reduce the size of your clique
Like poof, like I am a magician
I'm a giant to you, trick, I'm bigger than you
Feel like a pool stick in a room full of toothpicks
Don't compare none of these rap wannabe cats to me
The best fear me, the rest is dead money
Now that I'm back on the scene
It's back to your baby mommas chasing me, I'm back on TV, yeah buddy
Come get me cause we ain't scared
Catch a buck fifty the size of Freeway's beard, yeah
Ain't no need to  the vest protecting the K
From ripping through bricks and hitting the rest of your henchmen
Never been in the penitentiary, never get tense
When it's war, I never worry about catching a sentence
I don't care if you're strong especially since my weapon is long enough to bury you with whatever you're benching
I ain't friendly, I don't talk for nobody
Who ain't cutting a check unless you're a dentist
You can never attempt to diss me
If you do, I will censor the lead of your pencil
You punks better be distant
One punch will leave you lumped and
Dumber than Jessica Simpson

Meeting of the Bosses,Independent’s Day,2005.0,"Huh, soldiers, henchmen, fightin' for the dough

Walkin' through the steps of the rise and the fall of an empire
Crumble to the floor
Through the wire like Avon and Stringer
They gon' sting ya when it comes to that call
Soldiers, hoes and vultures lurkin'
Lookin' for that work and
Hopin' they could make a couple dollars
Off another mothafuckin' bloody murder
It's the problem but no-oh, it's the quality of knowin'
That the part of gettin' dough is you can't be out of control
If you gets in the way of my paper, by my skyscraper
We can chunk it, long as you ain't crossed that line
You can put me on the phone with your boss, we could squash it

It's the meeting of the bosses, meeting of the bosses
Why don't you tell 'em lil' niggas ""Beat it, we talkin'""

Some of these wars at the point of no returnin'
Some of these boys at the point of no concernin'
Some of these courts at the point of no adjournin'
How? How many cars can you run up on before
Somebody wanna war, but nobody wanna talk
Hit you in the die hard
Niggas momma's calling involvin' the law
Cross taped up to the chest
And your enemies fuckin' with them boys for protection

The pastor of the church nigga, that's when it's on
The path that you own nigga, that's where you goin'
Clap if you want holmes 'til your ass gone
Now you finally gotta kill
But the snowball is rollin' down that hill accumulatin' size
By the time it arrives at the bottom of the hill
It'll be countless homicides
And avalanches for the ambiance outside you
Countless mommas cryin', sisters goin' boo hoo
Niggas killin' 'cause of what they true to
Who's the villain here nigga, tell me what would you do

They do the type of shit you ain't heard of
Divide a nigga clique with the burner
It's all about ahhhhhh-ah-ah-ah-ah-ahhhhhh-ah-ah-ah-ah

I'm like Socrates
So to assume is to make an ass out of you fast after you drop to me
Look at the word, that's a suit, that's what you would do
Choo-choo train handguns, do your crew
I squeeze while I'm lookin at you
Cause you made a mistake like my nigga Crooked I's tattoo
I'm the answer - you niggas is candy
Ya heart pump blood yet smell like a Jolly Rancher
While I'm lampin in my mansion with my private dancer
My man's outside of your house, my hired campers
I ain't the hardest nigga in the world
All I know is if you love me and know me you know I


Yup, you know I fucks with them niggas that murder
They trigger finger's itchy when they grippin them burners
I am not a 9-to-5'er, I don't sit with them workers
Nigga I was flippin work while you was flippin them burgers
But I used to work in offices, now I'm the president
I'm where the Oval Office is but I don't roll with officers
I roll with loaded cartidges, don't know what law enforcement is
I know, I was marvelous, the road is like an orphanage
I blow and explode because I'm the arsonist, unloadin where the target is
I throw, gang signs when I pose for photographers

Yeah

I show up looking like money, that diamond chain on
Bitches is dick swinging, getting their hang on
Expensive frames on, touch me, your ass is grass
Speaking of grass, this stripper's tryna get rained on
I'm rich, but I ain't no drug dealer, I hang with them
I can talk business and talk shit on the same phone
My kidney floating, I'm drinking like I'm supposed to
They call me Frank The Tank in the hood, I'm old school
I keep a different bitch in the car when I roll though
Nigga, I be bringing out more hoes than the shows do
You got a girl, nigga, I got girls, nigga
The difference between us is my penis is plural, nigga
I'm nicknaming my car, call it ""Ass In The Martin""
You niggas living like rats in a shackled apartment
Take that back, that's wack, it's the fact that you bought it
I act retarded, my mind's on the back of a carton
I never thought that I'd see the day that rappers was blogging
They sound hungry but them niggas is actually starving
Perhaps it's the chardonnay I'm at the crib sipping
You niggas working, but dig this here what  different
You're working out in the gym, how 'bout we kill niggas
We exercise by gun running and wig lifting
Sig spitting, the pimps see us, we're big pimping
I don't be sniffing no cane but that shit is tempting

Weatherman with that change, I make it rain on them
Weatherman with that thing, I go insane on them
Let a ho give me brain, the numbers change on them
When the cheddar go on their heads, bullets got names on them

Weatherman in my hood, I make it snow there
Posted on blocks, getting higher than a goat there
If you're liking the flow, then nigga, you're a cokehead
Oh yeah, this thing on my waist got a kick like a steel toe
Earring wearing cutie, ring wearing elbow
M.I.C. chain saying hello
I'm looking cool in the whip, you niggas looking jello
Plus you got the pie face
I got more goons than Tom got friends on MySpace
Never hungry, no thanks
I ate, look mama, my plate's scrapped
They say the burbs don't make killers
We got them bodybags in, we're making a killing
You niggas snitching, we got the paperwork
Without no wheels, I still have a way to work
Welcome to the barbershop
Where we all keep cutters, not a knife
But a chopper motherfucker, real street smart, I can teach heart
My crew rock solid, y'all just trying to be hard
We love our kids, we're always overseas
But we hardly ever see ours
You can't rewind that time like a DVR
Y'all not, we are
We ball, stay fresh to death, we gon' see y'all


I write raps with crack rocks on black paper
Rhyme savior, new grind, time to cake up
You're getting money, nigga pay up
You said you're balling, so thou give me two like a lay up
Real lyricist, been R.A.W
You ain't never been shit, that's why I don't fuck with you
Untouchable me, look and find V
In the Murcielago with a Birkin model
I'm known wherever I go, Chicago to Oslo
You ain't been across the water since they shut down Boblo
Streetwise volatile, but as far as music
You can call me Pablo, the rest of y'all the Cubans
Prime contender
Plus I roll with the king like I set a screen on one of LeBron's defenders
And the hoes want me like the clothes that say Doce
No bae, that's Do-che, you need an upgrade
You boys are funny, I rap for money, silly
And I been to more countries than you monkeys been to cities
Man, I grind everyday
The only thing you know 'bout hustling is the dance at a cabaret
And we cop that, mac 11's cock that
That beretta cock back, what you spit is not rap
I'm a pimp, what you want, Black, White, or Asian
Cars reserved, only bring them out on occasion
When I do, soon as I meet her, I hit the diva bust
And she leave it on her face like it's Noxzema
She was scream like she was possessed by a demon
Working on that cock and I pay her with my semen
You insecurely hate 'cause you see Royce
And Mike B the only ones left in the D with jewelry
But hate on, hater, the AR spray y'all

When I spit words into my mic, my words are weapons

I seek and find the most blistering cold flows from history
Bitten from over centuries ago
You've arisen the old beats, the liquid mystique
Written robe, village cheap
Illest lyric-beat mixture, relief picture
Lead statistics show souls encrypted with soldier's scriptures in cryptic codes
I am, back from the dead
To show you the words flip-flop from the source
With a hip-hop quotable 
I show you my worth, all the way 'round when I play up
I'll see you niggas on your way down, when I'm on my way up
It's only one way to survive, and I chose to do it
Six million ways to die and I chose the music
Shut it down myself, I should've backed when
Should've, could've, 'till I was out, then they pulled me back in
You can never count me out, clear the sorrow
The artist is here today, here tomorrow, long as everybody

My past haunts the present and future
I don't even know if I know what I'm doing
I made some mistakes and lost
Only favor I take are never call, even if we never talk nigga

Back In the days when I was young
Im not a kid anymore but somedays
I Sit and wish I was A Kid Again
Back In the days.....
Royce Da 5 9
(Verse I)
Back in the days when I was just a little niggero
I looked up to my bigger bro begged if I could kick it
So when he when out with girls I could go taggin along naggin
If she had a sis I could mack a baby hoodrat
Yall remember way back then when it was 1985 all the way live
I think I was about ten
One of those happy little niggas singin the blues
That be always tryna bag with the shag and karate shoes
Sayin yo momma black his momma this his momma that
Then he'd get mad and wanna scrap we'd stay mad about
10 minutes then its like back on the bike to play Hide and Go Get It
With the younger hoes by the bungalos then switch to playin ding dong ditch
When that gets old and too cold to hack it
Throw on a bomber jacket
You could tell the ballas 'cause they bailed wearin Gazelles
If they really had money raised we sportin new K's
And all the girls had they turkish link
If it broke then they made earrings too
Like they meant to do it
But sometimes I still sit and reminiese and
Think about the years I was raised back in the days

When my crew and I were in Jr. High in 7th grade I hated school
(Wished it had blown up)
No doubt I couldn't wait to get out
(And be a grown up)
But let me finish this reminiscin and tellin
Bout when girls was bailin tight courderoys like
For the boys basket weaves, Nike, Cortez, and Footsie Socks
And eatin pickles with Toosie Pops and it dont stop
Im glad 'cause when J.J. fad that Supersonic
It was kinda like a sport, to wear biker shorts
Or, to wear jeans and it seemed like the masses
Of hoochies had Poison airbrushed on they asses
Dudes had on Nike suits and the Pumas with the fat laces
'cause it was either that or K-Swiss
I miss those days and so I pout like a grown jerk
Wishin all I had to do now was finish homework
Its true you dont real-a-lize really what you got til its gone
And Im not gonna sing anotha sad song
But sometimes I do sit and reminisce then
Think about the years I was raised
Back In The Day

(The variations w/ royce and others)(2x)
(Verse III)
Well, its the niggero I figga that now Im all grown up
Be'cause Im 18 years old and guess you could say Im holdin down
A steady job, true steady mobbin, you steady bobbin your head
And Im paid so I got it made but
Didn't always have clout useta live in South
Central L.A. thats where I stayed and figured a way out
I gave it all I had so for what its worth
I went from rags to riches which is a drag but now Im first
So (??? is on our way up)
Yup, we said that we was gonna make it since a kid
And we finally did but
Sometimes I still sit and reminisce then
Think about the years I was raised

I've got caveman tendencies, Niggas club, I club niggas
I get clumsy when I slip into a zone, I'm a blood spiller
I grew up to grub on, the grub of other niggas
My demeanor's hyena hiding in this dog eat dog world
Waiting for the day you murder prey
I'll come through in a convertible
To murder the murderers with gloves on
And treat it like it's a big feast and pick my teeth with a vertebrae
Even though I planned to be back, I don't plan to leave behind a bone
I rhyme with no apathy My mind's stuck on
Beef and bon apetit I don't have to get deep I ride alone
Survival of the fittest in this new era Contra war zone
I’m in a fitted with my blueberry Encore 4s on
I’m trying to stomp a fucking thug long
Enough to make my shoes ugly
Enough for me to walk out of there
Lookin like I got a pair of smudged orange Lugz on
Married to the streets but the love gone
Up north in a car clean
Sitting somewhere with a Harley
Looking like a art scene
How I'm cut as my gut feeling tells me you cut wrong
If you got heartstrings
I got a bow and arrow going through mine
Like the one that Chuck Norris tugs on
He feelin froggy, either he can leap or sip some tea
I'm gripping heat that's how it's gonna get handled
Even if you mugged wrong don't underestimate the range of my greatness
Blazing all night Play your cards right
Might want to bring all your aces
I got an angel on my shoulder who's telling me
What the hell are you doing
While the devil's going to fuck what he saying into Jason
Because of Jay Z, I got pistols with beans
I call them bleekays with lazers
You try to faze me Your face will be looking like Enrique Iglesias
If yesterday i borrowed from him, Tomorrow I'll repay him with patience
And my apartment might remind you of Martin
All you see is the Tommy, Bruhh man, Me, Pam, and cases
I'm trapped with my feet lounged up, Beside a feline
It sucks that y'all cats is just
Fucked beyond being a peon
It's probably because he riding in the neon
And I'm in the SL, I'm SLP, and he von dutch
My wood fragrances giving these bitches pussy favors
With the electricity of ions inspired by Elon Musk
He told me he's afraid to talk, When I said ""speak what you feel""
And that's exactly how I keep it, Eat what you kill

Eat, What You, Kill
Eat what you kill
And that's the truth until the cemetery

Rap with wolf spirit, All the crooks feel it
Heart of lion though, I ain’t lying ho, Violent rhino
Angry hippopotamus, Crocodile smile, swim in lakes that are bottomless
Swam cruddy waters,  jam muddy waters
Reefer and champagne, Played at the end game
End of my campaign, I'm a champion
See the belt, ho, Know I was felt ho
We the Pistons in the 8, 9, and 9-0
Bad boy, bad boy, Like Shyne Po
Its 85 and I'm the Benz in the Chicago

Then start dickin, gangsta from start to the finish
Whassup - never socialable, nigga we too disposable
If I get close to you it's probably to dispose of you quicker
Go 'head, try somethin - live or die by these numbers
I'd rather live paralyzed than to die runnin, you feel it
Stay out his path, he's chaotic and mad
Pull a K out and blast, and treat every day like his last
I'm just a street nigga rhymin some words
Dabble in the finest of furs, cowboy minus the spurs and saddle
Prefer for battle; most deserved
In highest level in cowboy status is not from herdin cattle

Lawyer drunk off Henny, parole violators with me
And still I walk cause it's real
Take they ass to trial then they lose a quarter mil', now that's a deal
Filthy rich at his best
Love hell I write, with a 7 on my chest
I come, real street knowledge, boulevard trade school
Paid dues, cause niggas know I honor the rules
Left no clues, X found, case is closed
While you go against the grain, with a plane of fo's
Take that slang to go, with the rubber handle steel
Spit dum-dums at labels, with a 50-50 deal
Explode to your guts, that part left hollow
Show the world your nuts, I'm the hoodlum role model
To all the competition that'll follow
Just remember damage to the 99th power
No one knows the hour, that the Bow will strike
Took the sword from Hitler, that they stuck in Christ
Now who's nice? .. Now who's nice?


Yo, you see the press is too hot (uh-huh) when you rush my flows
I got, three for twenty-five, rhymes flip like blows
What you never heard this voice, it's big Cee from the state
(where you from nigga?) Where we pimp hustle hard, bang it out for the weight
Eyes wide, cause me and my niggas organize crime
You either get it in the streets, or runnin from the jail lines
My game's at command, I show the world my status
It's filthy to the death blastin black automatics
You niggas talk pain, he will catch these shells
Twenty-three hours on lockdown, one out your cell
I know it sounds sick, when you deal in this form
My city, the home where the killers is born
Close capture, East and West, now that you have to
Leave a little room for this Midwest rapture
And there's no endin, to the words I spit
I sacrifice my soul for this filthy rich shit (gangsta shit)

Blasphemous mind ill steal rhyme skill
Nas couldn't rhyme for this, Nickel-Nine will
I go through, cool out, blow a whole crew
Cool out bro, out-glow a whole jewel
We bout to blow up, got your nose up
You could catch a blocka-blocka try to stop or hold us
And your block a whole bust, live news
Ride through with one girl and five dudes
Best crew in the D, niggas best move
All you niggas gun sleep and your vest used
Niggas bluffin, bore me, nothin for me
The only overlord me, only glory, you reach!
Wake up and smell the aroma nigga you sleep
The contract is out on The King, nigga you breach

Respect dawgs, expect your neck cut rope
The barrel of the Swiss, whole tec up close

Paranoia,Independent’s Day,2005.0,"Call it Paranoia. Yea
Every day is war. Every day, niggas is gon' hate
Gotta move

I'm a walking target
I'm so far from soft, I'm probably close to the hardest
Nigga you ever saw, been never thug, never had a problem
And the shit he never starts, sickest artist there ever was
Nigga found dead in his house, don't know who did it
Yea, you bet it was me, niggas die at the pavement
I'm wavin a nine out of the window and blazin
Is your house shakin
Who's inside nigga, it's funeral time nigga
They die from stray hits, pride wasted
Cry your face, I ain't your suit and your tie
Now look what you made us
Look at the witnesses, all of them look shakin
And alls they seen was the back of a green car with the plate flipped
Look at the news, I did it without puttin a hit out own
You homies in chrome, watch that nigga

I got my back, because it's my gat
And my mouth that *Started the War*
Lookin around me, got a gun on my lap
While I'm drivin, taking the back routs *Home*
If your headlights is in my rearview
For longer than three lights, and I don't know you
I'mma pull over, And I might shoot you
You should go around me, and don't look at me
'Till after you pass me, cuz I might blast you nigga *I'm at war*
I'm Paranoid, always on point
Always holding nigga, always sober. Call it paranoia

In your bushes, on the side of your house
Waitin to smoke you when come in from hangin out
Friday night, perfect, I timed it just right
I know you at the club cuz your car is nowhere in sight
I'm like the DC sniper, Mr. Malvo
Strategically precise when I squeeze the cali-co
You look like a asshole, full of shit
Niggas sure to get hit, when my fo-fo spit
Black shirt, black jeans, black boots, black whip
Black mask, paif of black leather gloves for my grip
I don't need no print, a killer with a plan
Makin sure I dont get, gunpowder on my hands
All drama I'mma end it, murder game splended
Leavin all crews for the fucker in forensics
I got, two dependants, I gotta make it home
Clean get-away, two bullets through your dome
Is locked nigga
 - La the Darkman

And that's just how the story goes y'all
Any nigga where I'm from already knows
Funny, my homie cuz said niggas gon' bring you a bowl of soup when you sick
But if you die, then gonna love you later
Think you a fuckin statue or some shit
God bless these streets, God bless these streets right now
I'mma just be doing my thing so maybe, you know, I could show you how
Don't come lookin for trouble, cuz you just might find it
Don't stand too close to me, I'm always on point, never blinded",https://genius.com/Royce-da-59-paranoia-lyrics

I blow a nigga top off him if he acts ruthless
Go ahead, act stupid

Stretch a nigga out like the asshole of Raz B
Blu, you my boy, you my boy, Blu
I'm a fucking alcoholic nigga, I'll destroy you
I'm the shit fool
I'm a part of the I'm-The-Shit crew
I don't give a fuck if you got your momma with you
I'll split you, gun long as my homie's, talk
But when I see you, you better skate like Tony Hawk
Your dogs only bark, run up on me, mark
I paint the wall with your ass, it's only art
Felonious homies is with me, nigga, don't excite us
Fuck around and get stole on like Winona Ryder
Bitch, shut your motherfucking piehole
Before I put you in the paper in black and white like a Mulatto
Drunker than fuck, like, where the bottle?
Having a threesome with a pair of models

'Til the .9's is out flyin out with the split bones
I learned you just talkin, it's just a song
Your words will not turn to sticks and stone
Don't worry about murder my mob won't do it
Only worries is worryin how I'm gon' do it
That mouth you got, it'll create yo' hype
And you might wanna watch it cause it could save yo' life

I don't mess with what I can't leave in less than thirty seconds
You will rest in a box in back of a hearse if I feel threatened
You got your vest on but I don't know why cause my AK say it's just a shirt
You be bench-pressin the earth and not blastin or askin questions, first

Yeah.. c'mon, yeah.. M.I.C...
Of all I'm a gangsta, the album is scary
I'm Malcolm, I'll get down if necessary (necessary)
By any means - in which
You breathe in the mic is the reason you left with a skinny team
This .9 rings, settin 'em straight
The rest, I'll show 'em what the five fingers said to the face
If, act hard and you will head for the Gates
And I don't mean the one in your backyard; I'm talkin Pearly
Christians call it sinnin (yeah) Muslims call it winnin
And witnesses call me worldly (worldly)
This life is full of the type of nigga that'll pull out a gun or a knife
Do it and run off in the night

Asbestos flames come out of his mouth, he a rider
The next best thing to the Mafia and my motto is


Yeah.. Rock Bottom nigga, yeah
T-Dot nigga, yeah, the M.I.C

Spittin real life from this shit
AK rifle with clips is chrome with the knife on the tip
Or two .9's sit right on my hip, that'll light up your strip
And if you drivin let 'em die in your whip
Moms cryin and shit, fuck talk, better duck the lead
Cause them bullets poppin out the toaster like Wonder bread
Rhyme with your Lex out, chief in ex' house beaten
When I whip tecs out you stressed out bleedin
Wife and kids get X'ed out even
Kill stress out, catch 'em leavin while I'm in the next house squeezin
Stop breathin when barettas be spittin, I never be missin
We actin like the gun law never resistant (whoa)
See I laugh when niggas be stuntin
Cause one flick of a button'll pop the stash and the triggers be thumpin
Dumpin niggas ain't killin right, dealers ain't dealin right
Fuck the mic, real life, this is what I'm feelin like (like)

Make you run like a cheetah,

Your neck a lil' froze, then let me turn the heat up

Yeah, real niggas on the prowl, HOO!

You's in the presence of wolves, let go your goods
I smell your blood in my neck of the woods
Fuck around with us and get found on your neck in the woods
Give him respect in his hood, don't mess with his crew
Niggas be, salty as pretzels when I'm in the Lex' and it's movin
Invadin and steppin in my shoes is a definite intrusion
I'm exceptionally cool, never expect to be under pressure
Or rescued, definitely only sweat in the booth
I'm officially fuckin you up with, nuttin but wit
A blizzard is frozen, hidden under the clothin
Listen, you lyrical nothin you, you touchin who?
When it was wrote, you spit it, you thought you ripped it you loved it
It's like, the sun is above us when the wrist is uncovered
Like, all you gon' spit is blood or kick is the bucket
Like, ninety-nine percent of you niggas that rhyme SUCK!
This is, the point of no return, I'm stuck

Yo, yo you fuck-head niggas ain't makin gangsta music
I make music for gangstas, it's therapeudic
You wild out to it, let the guns go too
Spittin out, skeet out, smoke a blunt to it (ERRR!)
Fake niggas don't dare, it's too real
Have you doin drive-bys on my command, NOW KILL! (UHH!)
Go on, sniff the chi-chi, rock along with me
It goes - guns, murder murder live in Rock City
You knowwww - don't let you get beside yourself
It's just a, terrible thing to just lose your health
Look wrong, don't speak, just lose your wealth
That's the truth baby boy - shhh, quiet as kept
They games we play, official titty bars and rims
Blowin money on pussy, you can probably steal
Drink so much alcohol, shit, liver like steel
That's they way that I am; light, slim but still

I feel the heat around the corner but I can't see smoke
Feel it comin in the night, no lights no coats
They say it's cold out here, I know how that feel
No help when you down, well reality ill
See the life and the lights on connected with crime
Wanna bang out these rhymes but can't say street times
What you about the struggle of what Cut go through?
When niggas tryin to grind, what won't they do?
It's do or die baby, y'all all alone
No hoes, just your soul, and a heart this cold
Gotta, stay away; don't let your, spirit break
More, moves to make might not, be your fate
Get Cut Throat on these pussies, that's the ride I took
Last gangsta left standin in a room full of crooks
If it's poppin come the fuck on, let's handle this now
My soliders stratigize, that's how we get down

Look at my life, I'm dead, gunshots over my head
I - sleep on the streets, gunshots over my bed
Carryin unnecessary weight, envy and hate
X-Government Agent, enemy of the state
Death, covers the pavement, tecs under your waist
Limited aim, unlimited range, niggas erase
Slow down, you gettin on now, your name is mentioned
In and outta the game, fame done stained your vision
As light shines you niggas just write rhymes
Confined in light time combined with mental dead bitches
The black man just tryin to get ahead witchu
Open your eyes 'fore some dumb nigga with lead hits you (uhh)
I speak peace cause peace is relevant
Continuous struggle for betterment, war with inner self
Fightin with the inner beast, wantin whores and cuties
That shows around the globe during my time of duty
Devils can't kill me, niggas can't stop me
Listen and learn, witness the return of the mock D
Death is a funny thing - you can die, bein broke
Or you can die from the drama that gettin money bring

Knife up close, I poke and throat slashing

Tonight is guaranteed, yesterday was not

I came in this game like it's more than rap
Dog, I'm tryin' to destroy the salary cap
The Source is happy we came six covers its covered
That'll last about May, June well into the summer
Why talk about different colors for various coupes
Shit green fart Blue, oooh clever you
Help me ma' I'll take a shot at any one of y'all
Got mami droppin' draws before the first phone call
We some gangstas study the ten crack commandments
Stay big worship Hail Mary that's how we live
Lay low good guys catch you with a hook I, know why you lie

You cannot lie or deny these niggas ain't rah rah
Put the barrel on the bridge of your nose and turn you cock-eyed
Steppin to us not wise, told you how to get live
Go in depth best with the finger next to the index
Such threats expect five guys, five techs
Make they gats all sing in unison like a quintet
They don't say whodi, son, dun, or youngn
You can owe em and say hi and they greet you like ""Hey Guy""
What up though Nickel, Jah, Tre', X, and Cut Throat
My brethrens all veterans all throwin up sevens
When we rock hits to the sky throw em up to the heavens
Us and crews clash no more we built it from poor
Me and Royce hit and restore what we were buildin before
So add a million sold or more when I get at you whores
State ya name gangsta!

Cut Throat the living threat street shit to blueprint
The guideline rappers sideline until they bow down
Them little guns y'all blow I stay on the low
Rap like this and work the scale like ""So""
Take it to the gutter we could duke or shoot it out
Switchblades pump gauge, whatever you about
Burn you to ya hood we could bang for the work
For the building or the blocks do the thang to the dirt
I'ma F**K-in fool crews DUCK and move
Stay in a F**KED up mood one F**KED up dude
When its hot I, breathe in the heat don't even sleep
I be knee deep in the beats that made me
Certified gangsta specialize in Duct Tape
Let you know how many fo' five slugs ya gut take
Show ya favorite thug how to be a thug, top that (NIGGA!)
Turn ya favorite drug into another drug, cop that (NIGGA!)

Jah da 5'9 speak and shake rhyme great history made
The street gangsta city flow race against time
Never sign for cash my hustles the shit
You feel the breeze push past you get a grip
Millennium game, earth tone keep it in range
Close to the grey I rock fake niggas shouldn't doubt us
Surrounded by crooks, full clips and fine weed
Choice clothes my mind blocked seein fine foes
Long nights bust those in small Christ
Niggas playin themselves just thinkin we rhyme alike
How would you fight me I'm like ten families strong
Manipulation by song relate to it niggas
Henny on the rocks toast to the real in God we trust
Calm gladiator song navigator

All of a sudden seasons change, your welcome

You smoke that what you wrote while broke, yellin rich
Didn't know you shoulda spoke while broke sayin poor

On the Road,M.I.C. (Make it Count),2004.0,"(Alright, what would you say is the best part about your career?)
The best part about my career is probably being able to
Do what I love doin all the time, which is, make music
The negative side of it
Is probably just being away from my family so much
Cause I find it, like an MC like myself
One of the many ways I can make money, is to pack up
And just, take my show on the road, you know what I'm saying?

Tired of the same old hustle
Same old niggas sayin they is gon' touch you
Foes wanna act up when they with back up
So I pack up and go - yeah, yeah
Niggas snitchin, niggas hittin nigga's bitches
This shit here is gettin ridiculous
Me and Vishis in here flickin pictures
Niggas gettin rich and sittin with them trick bitches
Now picture me locked up for life for
The nigga who controllin the drop in the price or
Niggas askin what I'm in they light for
Like I ain't got an army behind me to fight for me
Niggas money gettin glowed, niggas gonna get 'bows
And they gonna get sold, on the road
Cause at home they denyin to feel me
Labels wishin that they signed with the real me
Cause now that I rhyme with the feeling
That I am on, is dyin to kill me
But I am a soldier, as I'm gettin older
I'm takin my show on the road

You can find me, up in a quiet, town
Like Ohio, tyin it down (on the road)
It's nothin, the pump on the block where you come from
Cop and re-up and whyle (on the road)
Like a show you, go and come back with, dough
That's how shit goes (on the road)
And it's nothin to cop or re-up where you come from
It's how shit goes (on the road)

Yeah, yeah
I'mma give it to you 'til you leakin
The problem with me is that I speak with the nine-millimeter
The problem with me is that I ain't equal
Prove it to you, pull you a line out of people
That movie you starrin in is rated R
Because I am the sequel
But I'mma be triumphant at least speakin
Ridin through the Chi or the D or the D.C
Movin fifty pounds weekly
Lookin at the south region, thinkin about, am I greedy? (nah)
If I ain't, I don't eat inspired by Hennessy
Ridin in Tennessee (yeah)
Fuck around and meet me
Shuttin down everything from Uptown to up and down Beat Street
But I am a soldier, you know what I'm about
In the drop, I don't slow, when I go, on the road


Y'knowmsayin?
Like I, I see hip-hop goin forward
Y'know you got, people buyin into, basketball teams
And, all types of crazy shit, y'knowmsayin?
So, I see a lot of people
Being able to provide for they families
A lot of, Black people who would otherwise be out of work, havin jobs

One hand in the sky, other hand over my heart
Vouchin to be the last woman of my breed
Right alongside some niggas who seem to feel the same way
After all, one who stands for nothin falls for anything
So um, Tre Little why don't you stand up first?
Tell 'em your story

Yeah, I made my own bed, yeah that's what the judge said
Called me a young punk like he hold grudges
Held up the same knife that I lunge with
The one his lungs hit, I left him breathless
Haha.. ""Death is Certain""
But for you to gimme that sentence the system's not workin
Your Honor, understand my pain
It's like I got nothin to lose, and shit to gain
Please, hear me out
Dude doused gasoline my house to get me out
And all I could think about is how we was raised
And - he like the gauge, and - I prefer the nine man
Crime partners, robbin sprees
Ten years plus Your Honor, just him and me
And really - to make a long story short
This nigga tried to eat from my fork
Can't have that

(Stand up) Put your hand on your chest
The other hand in the air, and say that you solemnly swear
When you (stand up) basically
Reach out to the hatin streets, tell 'em to take a seat
After you (stand up) put your hand on your chest
The other hand in the air, and say that you solemnly swear
When you (stand up) they listen now
To a man who's standin demandin respect cause they sittin down

I was born in this world the most, innocent child
With no worries, expectations, look how I smile
Everybody proud, my household loud
Look what he can do now, gangstas is all around
Couldn't fathom bein touched, by the life they led
Would've rather been in church and touched by Christ instead
I done seen everything from teens turn crack mothers
Robberies led by teens are undercover
And the law, is the same way my homeboy's do
Took the work behind the kitchen sink, hustle was smooth
And the risk never mattered, cause there's strength in fear
Not thinkin beyond the next day I'm gettin this here
And the world don't give a fuck, that's my thinkin
Cause the world don't give a fuck, heavily drinkin
Hit the, block at night when the bars let out
Raw heads'll still hit me 'til they veins dead out
I'm trapped


I saw four corners, crackheads on two of 'em
Whores on opposite sides; I was 'bout nine or ten
Wonderin why my sisters was lookin like they was homeless (damn)
Cars'll roll up, and they hop in them for a moment
Wasn't later I realized they need a supply
To get it, would take a few minutes, they blow him in his ride
It seems the scenes I've seen with fiends in abundance was
Part on some scheme to intervene in the number of
People who make it up out of this life, conspiracy theory
Nah, not quite; but government gotta know somethin
Tell a child we were once unified, he might doubt it
Went from, yellin ""Black power"" to sniffin white powder
Could it be we wasn't brought here to be free, just subserviant
To those in authority, slowly I'm learnin this
Evolution of the mind defines us as men
My resolution, it's time for revolution to begin


Feel me? Nobody respects you for sittin down
Respect is to be earned, it's yours for the takin
Closed mouths don't get fed
Gotta get the wet behind your back
Attack the storm, when it rains it pours

That'll shine whenever I die
We never lie, you'll never get by
U just got love, I used to roll wit big shot thugs to hip hop clubs
To act up, the fifth got hugged and blasted
Pits got dugged and filled back up wit stiffs wrapped up in plastic

Tell you how we tell lies, tell what he wear his hair like
You can't amaze the amazing, change your ways
We plant bodies, throw stones wit the names engraved
The games you play, make me point this thang your way
My niggas rob for consistency, a chain a day
I'm about as humble as I can pretend to be
A real nigga's best friend, a bitch nigga's worst enemy
It don't hurt, it offends me
The chrome bursts in a frenzy
It's gon' work till it's empty
Just makin' sure that my gun shoots faster than yours
And I'm chasin' you, and my bullets is chasin' yours

Bomb with a lit wick expression

My saliva and spit could split thread into fiber and bits
So trust me, I'm as live as it gets
Everybody claim they the best and they head the throne
Since B.I.G is gone, if you ask me, they ""Dead Wrong""
My flow is hotter than the flash from the click
When the hammer slaps the bullet on the ass from the clip
You wind up in a room full of my dogs
I'll have you feeling like a fire hydrant in a room full of dogs
So come, come now, get pissed on, shitted on
Tough talk turns to, ""Can't we all just get along""
You get blazed when the mic's off, shot when it's on
You probably ducked when they laid the gun shot in your song
My gun st-stutters when it speaks to you
Utter shit to repeat to you
Enough in the clip, to give a speech to you
Me and Premier, we kind of the same in ways
We both speak with our hands in dangerous ways
Rap now is a circus of clowns
A whole lot of lip from cliques I'd probably rap circles around

Everyday I'm meeting somebody and all of they peeps
Quick to shake a nigga's hand and show me all of they teeth
And these bitches, I be patting they asses
They be all dumb and googly-eyed looking at me, batting they lashes
Rappers think Detroit niggas not as down as them
Or since that I'm down with Slim that I sound like him
Quick to judge me and tell me that my hook might sell
And say faggot shit to me like I look like L
My advice: quit talking, it's over, I was knockin' niggas out
When you was knocking sticks off of they shoulders
I got dirt done in my past, I know y'all sweat
I got regrets older than some of you so-called vets

To the studio and bring the bomb squad to the show

Ridin' the dick of the one
Who rides sick wit' a young
Fly chick and a gun
Inside the whip when he come
Shine lyrically dope

A fly mix with a toast

From my side to run in with my enemies (punks!)

Go and mention me homie, you gon' eventually jump
You gon' switch when it comes to that chrome click

Til I spit and you jump back on the dick of the one

Minus a fifth of that rum
Divide it with the hunger
Times it with the times you fronted on my shit, on my dick

Jeah. I'mma tell y'all motherfuckers one thing right now. I just spilt my motherfuckin' liquor in this booth and I'm UPSET. Slaughterhouse is in the building. 8/11 album in stores. Nickle nine is in the building. You want a problem? It's yours
:
I am God's concoction of Molotov breathin'
Put inside an out and lost region
I am law, king and
I eat body, buy 'em all blingin'
Powder or weed, know I got it all seasoned
And you should just agree that you could be a G
And you can do the Shady thang, you can flip the E
Like the fifth letter in my nigga Shady's name
You fuckin' with the head conductor of the gravy train
I gotta thank the shooters
Cause they the reason niggas go missin' flyin' over that Triangle that ain't Bermuda
So what you speakin' 'bout?
It's ironic that I'm stayin' at The Palms and that's what your bitch eatin' out
I ain't that worried 'bout what you want to do to me
What the world would like to do to Dr. Conrad Murray
I'll be flow, switchin' so much it's almost a given
:
Who they gon' compare us to?
This is not a contest
Slaughterhouse is a bionic bomb threat
This is God's doin' not a concept
This is not a contract
We are not The Four Horsemen, we are beyond that
Respect to Wu cause that respect was due
But we will step to any of the rest of you
If you ain't the Random Axe I don't see how you can relax
Let me repeat
If you ain't the Random Axe I don't see how you can relax
This is open season on any group, hammer back
You can jump in front of that barrel if you wanna
You on that marijuana, I'm high I'm feelin' like a pharaoh hailing from Ghana
Shark in that water though I am a whale of a problem
Back up the Bird like I'm Kevin McHale, I got 'em
He a beast, you need to stay on your tippy toes to see his feets
I let the re-up speak
I'll let you owe me, playin' PSP, while I let the homies play that GPS
So street thugs I recruit, I salute
That way I ain't gotta spill your cheap blood on my suit
What it cost me to tailor this, them niggas would kill for
They don't ask if it's rap beef or if it's real war
I'm the best nigga out, cut and dry done
No matter what you up to/two, I won/one
The combination of lion hearts and fine art
We like a modern day tribe you couldn't pry apart
If we ain't competing with the Juice Crewers
Busta Rhymes sittin' us down to Leaders Of The New Schoolers
DJ Premier is sayin' ""Wow!""
Bun B, M.O.P., askin' niggas how
This is done in a way where it works for the betterment of everyone involved
It's intelligent, it's awesome
Before we had the block sayin', ""Yeah, we fuck with y'all.""
But now we got the Lox sayin', ""Yeah, we fuck with y'all.""
This is legendary, death to new groups
We cuttin' niggas short like the end of February
This is straight up pioneer driven
I ain't stoppin' till I am is where Em is
I'm the template for the I Am There premise
Like a butt naked snitch, bare witness
This is the undertaking
I am the dead business

Nobody f***ing with us (feat. bun b & slaughterhouse),UnKnown,UnKnown,"Let's get it started like transmission and alternators
Got the keys in the cage ready for who you call the greatest
Takin 'em down from the biggest bitches to smallest haters
I'm 'bout to serve these niggas, call 'em waiters
Got my mind right, money right, ready for war
And I got the C4, under my competitor's car
These niggas runnin 'round talkin 'bout they better than moi
When I'm done all that's gon' be left bitch is ya head and ya bra
Bitch I'm ahead of the pack, and I'm ahead of the game
And I put yo' head on a platter you put some shit on my name
Bitch I'm the shit, see the stains that I done left on the track?
And I ain't sayin no names but I left the best on they back
And they ain't sayin no names so I gotta say it myself
I'm finger fuckin this game so you gotta play with yourself
Don't pull a K off the shelf, or pull a strap out the stash
I ain't gotta draw the pistol, I will chop at yo' ass
I just let the hands of God toe-tap on you fast
Leave you mashed like potatoes on the top of the grass
Call the coppers to catch me and they'll just tell you to drop it
I'll find you sooner or later, and they can't do shit to stop it
Got that thang and I'ma pop it like a bubble on the double
I am trouble in the flesh, you can't see me with the Hubble
We ain't wishin these niggas good luck, go get a clover
This Bun B, it's ""B.E. 3,"" this shit is over
SLAUGHTERHOUUUUUSE! (Whoo, Kiiiiiiiid!)
Look at ya man look back at me, yeah I know, sickenin huh?
Few got a Porsche with only two doors, need to upgrade cause you missin some
We just got two different bills, different styles, different sums
Started as a drive-by, ended as a hit-and-run
Stop me in the streets, let it be properly when you greet
Fuck lookin for me, I'm on your property if it's beef
Not for robbery of ya piece, it's lobomomy with my peeps
That comraderie is usually sodomy for the beat
'Less my critics put a lens on them, so I could look through it
Shut the fuck up, probably mean that you too shook to do it
We'd see two pennies to your name, yet you so saucy
When I fix this game you can (Thank Me Later) for it, no Aubrey
Switch my demeanor up I'm, off my 380 shit
My, future's bright, stars is by my head, baby shit
Make me sick, what you eat don't make me shit
Found out the reason they hate me is my God-like presence, must be athiest
While all of the frauds in rap is talkin swag put a fork in that
Slaughter's back, listen nigga I got houses all across the map
Even got a Boston pad, got this bitch from Boston bad
Well put her in a wrestlin move, but I heard she got that (Boston Crab)
Batteries in your back, go by what he say
Just need you to know that it's no lee-way, and the tables are turned, go DJ
So you know what that blindfold's for
That bloodshed's a secret, let's keep it behind closed doors

Who you said was dope again?
Ay, it ain't nobody fuckin with us, nobody fuckin with us
Who you said was hot again?
Ay ay, it ain't nobody fuckin with us, nobody fuckin with us
Who you say could spit again?
Ay, it ain't nobody fuckin with us, nobody fuckin with us
Who you say was dope again?
Ay ay, it ain't nobody fuckin with us, nobody fuckin with us
I'm the present and the future
Like Christmas in 2012 I'm the present in the future, an executive producer
You will never get to choose ya destiny cause you a pessimistic loser
Mess with me and I'll definitely shoot ya
I'ma do's ya like I'm reppin the Yakuza
Die hard like I'm sexin with Medusa, do somethin nigga
Born thuggin, I don't fuck with the cock
Nuts hang down my pant leg, balls tucked in my socks
I ain't gotta act tough to get a couple of props
Little nigga raised hisself, I don't know what's up with my pops
Do I think I'm the dopest, in America? I do
Make you switch your whole style like you're datin Erykah Badu
Pair of Ferragamo shoes, I will stomp you
I'm fucked up, like the relationship between Farrakhan and Jews
I'm spankin this instrumental, like a wrinkly old bitch
I'm whippin the kick and snare, make 'em pick they own switch
I'm smarter than computers that know how to fix they own glitch
I'll leave you face down, like chicks who lick they own tits
And from this day forward, Crooked is aging backwards
Gettin younger and fresher, puttin bums under some pressure
Yes sir! Watch the next Slaughterhouse album
Every line is white powder, I ain't talkin 'bout talcum
I am tighter than ""The Biggest Losers"" cruisin in a Smart car
Distinguished alkie, the flask on the armoire
I'm from the home of the most popular bomb weed
Most proper, hoes rock with my partners who top seed
Po' vodka, we gon' bottle pop in the calm breeze
No copper can stop a COB star - I'm a giant
Dumpin my cigar ashes out on top of the palm trees
Chrome chopper, if I squeeze you drop on the concrete
You wanna talk about the paper? Oh let's do it
Batter pocket syndrome, the money we gon' abuse it
Still gettin out-of-town paper so don't confuse it
Tell the hip-hop cops nah, it's only music
And haters steady eavesdroppin on ""The Bar Exam""

What the fuck goin' on? If they right were they wrong?
They got your boy feeling weak still I gotta be strong
Gotta keep vision clear and learn to play my position
 think what you don't know, that's the bitchin' tuition
I'm screaming 'fuck the world,' it's not a game
And they got me going crazy but still I'm sane
 runnin', got me thinkin' 'bout jumpin'
I mean like right over a bridge, don't give a fuck about nothin'
So tired of the bullshit, the critics, the fakes
About to give 'em a full clip, or whatever it takes

Nickel's the name, grippin' the pistol became
My way of life when I came outside of my mommas insane asylum vagina
I paid dues, the game gave me back my change in diamonds
It's ironic I came inside of your dame inside of the Cayman Islands
I'm one of the greats fool, the only thing
That me and Michael Jordan don't got in common is I don't fake moves

Alright, let’s get the dust off
Let’s get back to work

Yeah – I said victory, defeat – parallel feelings
Getting rich, friends trip, farewell bid ‘em
You go against me you won’t fare well
I’ll leave your ass bleeding in the stairwell
Turn you to the “the” between the “where Hell”
Is he, like the cologne that I spray on him?
Emerald, my stones so clean they looking sterile
I’m so major, that when I pass, treat these last flows like the last scroll
Auction off these last known pages
Stuck in my own ways, making asshole wages
Username is Passcode Vegas
It’s Nickel, nigga, you can keep your little two cents
No longer the Patron enthusiast, on to a new blueprint
I feel like zoning, find the headphones and spew it for my own amusement
Until it’s tool time, I ain’t use it for home improvement
And I don’t have to know magic, bruh
I’m waving this ratchet like abracadabra
That’s a cadaverer, and only God to witness our resemblance
My guys relentless, riding like Mogwais inside the Gremlin
Designer rifles out the window, you ain’t seen this heat
Banana clips see-through, looking like ballerina feet
Got your entire age-range on my dick
It’s nothing to put your little stage name on my list
I took a little break to make some plans in my life
I never thought I’d see the day that I’d put hands on my wife, but
That’s another story, perhaps another chapter
In the book written autobiographic by a warrior
Another story of a good guy whose eyelids are drunken shut
Getting fucked up so much, you don’t know what the fuck is up
Watching World Star, clutching a cup
Right after giving a side chick a bus driver uppercut
But that’s another story

Doing this rap shit until UPS calls

I ain't never gon' stop hitting your heart

Put your Glocks in the air and squeeze

That'll last about May, June, well into the summer
Why talk about different colors for various Coupes
Shit green, fart blue, ooh clever you
Help me ma, I'll take a shot at any one of y'alls
Got mami droppin drawers before the first phone call
We some gangstas, study the ""Ten Crack Commandments""

Lay low good guys, catch you with a hook I
Know why you lie, ya crew ain't quite like mine
Spit it like ooh my, these labels like ooh my

Go in depth best with the finger next to the index

You feel the breeze push past, you get a grip
Millennium game, earth tone keep it in range
Close to the grave I rock, fake niggas shouldn't doubt us
Surrounded by crooks, full clips and fine weed
Choice clothes, on my Bossi, and fine hoes
Long nights, bust those in small cris'
Niggas playin themselves for thinkin we rhyme alike
How would you fight me, I'm like ten families strong
Manipulation by song, relate to it niggas
Henny on the rocks toast to the real, in God we trust
Calm gladiator, song navigator
Them whole blocks got a story to tell
All of a sudden seasons change, you're welcome
(State your naaaame, gangsta!)

Billy Nix, black man is here, listen close
Spittin, just to niggas, X address the niggas
Most niggas don't see right, see light like it's darkness
No guns in sight, no might for the heartless
We run ya mics, you write like you're retarded
No offense but your flow's slow and dense
I know my niggas hearin the D, ya smellin this
You spoke that which you wrote while broke yellin rich
Didn't know, you shoulda spoke while broke sayin poor
Then Biggie up, ""Kick in the Door,"" play it some more
This is the evolution of emceein, who dissin us?
Gettin Rah, stick up nigga, hand me ya listeners
Get a job we here, D-Elite, touch it
Matter fact, niggas is wack, Wall Street fuck it
X government agent remember yo' name, remember yo' game
You niggas won't be spittin the same, motherfucker

I Goes In,Lost Files,2015.0,"Intro: 
Here they come yo
Here they come

Yeah Yeah
I ex-spits your bole
The tire you kicks is toyal
Black diamonds lookin' like tires dipped in oil
You niggas is about as fly as the wings on a parrot
If you a king I turn you into a king on a terrace
I'm sick with the fuck-a-nigga flu
Defiant as ?
The Imus
These nappy headed hoes is like a science
When I got the permit to tell that bitch ""perm it""
These niggas ain't got
Nothin' up their sleeves like a tank top
Stay in the streets with you like some rain drops
Nickel can't stop
Stick the game up
Leave them hands up
And then I flee away with Lil' Wayne's spot
Here they come yo
Bitches in the front row
Titties out they blouses
Screamin' out that they want mo
This is that
Lights out
Bring them bikes out
White boys bring them spikes out
I goes in

Where the G's at?
Throw your hands up
Stand up
Give me feed back
Where the G's at?
Where them true MC's at?
Guess who stepped through?
Royce
(He's back)

I'm a problem to these little niggas ain't I ma?
I'm prettier than you are honey, how vein am I?
Which lane am I?
I can do whatever style
I'm a mixture between Old Jeezy & 7 Mile
Let them bow to the devil's son, heaven's child
I'm the present, now and naw, I ain't tryin' to reconcile (nope)
All I'm tryin' to say is, what you been eatin'
I'm takin' til you lookin' like the '07 Kevin Liles
This a new day
But I ain't here to shoot you up
I'm sayin', not the new Dre and I'm the new Kurupt
Machine gun flow
Run and put the two two up
Tell the label to throw the tutu on you when they suit you up
Here they come yo
Soundin' like the booth blew up
Every time I rhyme you have to come and wipe the poo poo up
This is that
Light out
Bring them bikes out
White boys bring them spikes out

Where the G's at?
Throw your hands up, stand up
Give me feedback
Where the G's at?
Where the true MC's at?
Guess who stepped through
Royce
(He's back)

A lot of speculation on a nigga's reputation
I better state that I don't hesitate to set it straight
D Twizzy, them my niggas I don't ever hate
We can do a song for the cheddar date, set a date
And I ain't never fake
Always real always feel
Sicker than whoever you feel is always ill
But I ain't sorry, chill
I ain't come from Sorryville
I'm from the land of banana clips and Ferrari peels
Off leavin' a cloud of smoke the child is dope
The man is crack and I'm demandin' my advantage back (yes)
And it's that simple
Your man is back sinful
My bitch icey, nicety as Janet Jack Central
Here they come yo
Drum roll
Only one flow
Son know
And it's the reason you don't want ""Whoa""

Bring them bikes out

The hoe with me got her own bread with long legs
I got a squady like Gotti, I am Capone bred
Ridin' in a spaceship with a clip full of Coneheads
Nigga please they tryin' to cook me a manish raw
It's like tryin' to give a centipede a manicure
Word
You know that you ain't even in my classa
Herb
Cremate you and sprinkle you in my pasta
I'm fed off my publishin'
I call my bitch a Klingon cause she cling on my nuts and her head on some other shit
Face it you can't say shit
I bring a problem to you, turn you into Kim Kardashian, you can't shake it
Somebody tell these little boys I'm manic with the bars
Invitin' me to dance and end up Dancing With The Stars
Don't diss me cause I'm the reason why you livin'
This ain't Mysonne and Ness nigga, this is Tyson and Robin Givens

I still got my guard up so you ain't safe yet
I still make it your time like Flava Flav's neck
I bury a nigga pen right where the slain's flow be
With one hit, one buzzer beater like Shane Mosley
I'm from the murder capitol packed with them plain clothes
Insane O.G.'s with a name for slain soldiers
You can't lift him up
You can't stick him up
He in his own lane, he move like McCain's shoulders
The game over
Fuck chest, I bang heads
You either finna be duck lucky or brain dead
I'm twice as intelligent
I'm like Norman Bates takin' advice from one of my dead relatives
Like I can smell drama
My dead grandma
Told me to Knock You Out like she LL Mama

Worldstar you sleepin'

Internet you sleepin'

You can't ruin it, we're streakin'!
The flows like Frank naked in the street, ain't nobody else doin' it
I'm the shit fool
I take dudes to I'm The Shit School
Teach 'em, you can either sleep on me or get cool
I'm crack, in fact, I got a trapper flow
I got harder for those packs than Shaq will go
The average rapper's a nerd, they throw the peace sign
The roll up with they Geek Squad to the Apple Sto'
Y'all forgot he an Eminem product
He spot a snake in the grass that's cause there's venom inside him
And y'all hoes
Y'all should sell my CD at the pharmacy
And yours should be in the isle with feminine products
Gentlemen nada

I'm hard to swallow
Y'all get model's I get they throat workin'
Cut off his toes like Chicago bloggers
If he, act like a little baby, I'mma let the fo' burp him
When I walk in the booth, you can hear tires squeal
Then you hear sirens near the engineer's in riot gear
The FEDS prepare to raid him, come through and barricade him
I threaten good and I execute for who there to trade him
I am Premier's assailant, flossy, I'm frost bit
I'm surrounded by mo' ice than Sarah Palin
I photo bomb Biden even though Obama bitin'
I'm a nigga with power, dig it, like I'm Osiris

That's when you want to come in deep, but y'all sinking
And it ain't nothing over here sweet, so start thinking
We Motown, it's right here were the dough found
Spit the most rounds, we all ball inside a ghost town
Wall Street, we be the first to call beef
Walking up to me, it's gonna cost you all of your teeth
Made men that will do you in for a fee
Doing drive-bys inside a 6 or a B
Ask women who's the hottest and they say me
Ask niggas who's the hardest, they say me
Ask your mom who's the smartest, she says me
And as far as whose songs hitting the hardest, they play me
Im'ma show the ladies what I'm made of from NY to LA

How many niggas is you killing with?
How many millions and women with whips is you dealing with?
Tell me how you ball, buy out the mall
Or maybe go on tour and fly out tomorrow
Yo, where's your funds at and all that ice and shit?
Or where's your guns at and all of the knives and shit?
Seeing women with class in a street full of tricks
Leaving the shoe store with a jeep full of kicks
A yo, I'm frostbit, ice on my chest, I lost it
I walk in, stripes on my vest then talk shit
Diamonds is like shining bright lights
With more karats than average, sweating and blinding your eyesight
We make cream, legal, my chain is too sturdy
Who got game? We don't play clean, we too dirty
Black Jesus, the women in track pleaser
Keep a stack under my cap and max Visas
Showing love up in the club
Hot, showing up with thugs, stop going up for drugs
Subdue you, come on your set and get respect
Just listen to Clue, Funk Flex, and Sway & Tech
When you hear me, you can't front so don't start
I roll with lone sharks with guns and phone cards
Come through with the crushed linen
Benzes with the plushed finish, glass tint, and it's all for the women

United we stand, divided we ball
We fight and we brawl, inside of a bar
United we stand, divided we ball
Inside of a bar, we fight and we brawl
United we stand, divided we ball
We fight and we brawl, inside of a bar
United we stand, divided we ball
Inside of a bar, we fight and we brawl

We lighten you up, got you niggas tightening up
Knives or spikes on fight night, slicing you up
One of each, Lex rented with sex in it
Bottom line, come in peace or rest in it
These money niggas ain't playing with y'all this year
We tripling yours and y'all worked hard this year
Then we laid back then became stars this year
We're hard to meet, y'all niggas is hard to hear
We're trying to make a million, fuck all of these other rap niggas
Think they hold weight in the street cause they act bigger
That's how you turn whacked on your back on the river
Or get slapped or snatched out of your AC figure
I'm nice and you can't deny me for shit, nigga
Shot and split up, gotten rid of for six figures
Real niggas, that's why I'm in the clique
I done scratched the serial more times than you itch
Icy and flossy, yeah it's nice but it costs me
Like twice what you offered, pricey and glossy
Roll out the red carpet, they're bringing in Royce
The last man standing on Earth, the king of Detroit

I apologize to you

Anything I've ever done in the past to hurt you
I apologize to you
I apologize
{Repeat}
(Verse 1)
She cooks and Cleans
Irons my clothes like a Queen is supposed to
She hates when I drink
My miserable company don't know her
Won't bring us closer
This is an incredible woman I'm speaking on, now
Its not about looks or comparing her to Beyonce Knowles
Her roles more of a Rosa Parks
She knows her part, she's so smart
By the way she's fucking gorgeous she glows in the dark
I doubt if she lies
I will bet the farm she's been 100% faithful I cry when she cries
It's Ill, something that took a year to get
Extended to 6 years to the date
And end from a 10 minute mistake
That's not the way, she's got a good advantage
That's 50% of me gone, that's not a good balance
Second to my mother, a commodity
She's special, damn near close to her quality
Follow me

You Can Make It,UnKnown,2018.0,"Verse 1:
I feel like I can lift the world and put the planet on my shoulders
But I seen those artists fall
And let the weight just hold them down, but
I can't stop now, I'm in it too deep
I put too much time and money for abilities to peak, see
I've seen my capabilities, overcome the probabilities
That society instilled in me, but still I see
Other artists fall, that were just as good as me cause
Even with that mind of making it, it gets harder to breathe
But when I catch that glimpse of fresh air
It is right there, that I see my dreams ascend, yeah
Then I put that mic in my hand, it's very clear
This is my time dude
Flow's a perfect ten so we gonna Nickle and dime you
My rhymes grew, my minds screwed, that rent's due
But I'll die trying rather than have these dreams not come true
This is a struggle, how much more can I try?
I don't wanna work this 9 to 5, I'd rather work with 5'9""
Hook:
Love or career, no limits, no fear cause
You can make it, you can make it
See success in the mirror, it's closer than it appears, know that
You can make it, you can make it
On that path you steer, straight and narrow, don't veer cause
You can make it, you can make it
In my voice you can hear, all my pain and my tears, know that
You can make it, you can make it. (yeah, Nickle. Yeah.)
Verse 2:
All my life, I lived a life of beats, rhymes and street shit
Had my ups and downs, hustling around but in these times, I
Throw up the peace sign, who I eat with, its feast time
Now rewind, I used to listen to Esham in a Nissan
Now I'm ridin' round' the D in Porsche's
And I don't need media sources, to enforce that we important
Just for the moment, don't let it get to your head, don't
Allow your mind to be weak and you gotta be headstrong
I made it here, embodying all of my latest fears
Drunk as at the party, still my cadence clear
My equilibrium on the same zone my swag on
Car riding good, she in a good mood, her ride gone
Just like my bitch
Just my mistress, she likes my bitch but can't have her
Before I snitch, I think I'd rather; drop dead
Before I drop a dime like Hank Gathers, that's devastation
I take my life myself, to help my self-preservation

My Beretta returns your phone calls
I'd rather chrome you all, you know
Gotta invoke like it's data and blow your soul
To Saturn, it doesn't matter how you roll, I'd rather you go
To the cemetery or morgue with 10 or 12 of your boys over hoes, money, or irrelevant wars
Whoever ain't nice to the gun or the knife that'll number your nights
It's once in his life then he's done it before
Now he's a glitch in history so we would mention the mystery
A leader or henchmen we done heard it before
He never spoils like he's suppose to feel the 'dro and kill you before he feels you close
Now that's the price you pay when the fightin' is done
You hesitated on life and died with a gun
Millions of suckahs a freeze when the real approach, if you bluffing then you go
The steel is cold
Thought you was good in the hood if you pull and he pull, he'll run from you, nope
That thing you got in your pants can stop any man but it's not in your hand, so...
And let us pray that the nigga you face's steel is as cold as yours, I hope

Go downs..
Stumbled off grounds
Fire off many a rounds, I heard return fire 3% of the time
Your dogs was wives, actin like girls, get feminine when handlin guns
You could run or take the window, son
Or feel this hot one, we rip all strifes dun dun
Without a fight son, we keep the house dope like Pavenni's
We twist and pop Henny, gettin wet on the daily, and
Peers get chilly, turnin macks fully
Now they bandin', caught red handed and got remanded, for it
A one to three degree from V-O-P and N-C-C-V
And send me up a hub tours of state facilities
What could I do but sneak, burn a tree, or tobacco leaf
Or wait until my time served and get released
Cool, back on the streets I seen some old drama
I still hold heat to send your ass straight to trauma
These kids started to drilling like they ready and willing
I gave em exactly no time to switch feelings
Pulled out, to my man, look out
Commence the warfare, and rock these to sleep like this here
Seventy-two like as if I was back on the top
Hours of thinkin about how I'mma tip they ass up out the basket
Beligerant glass heads, I'm bashing
No knowledge of the man or his action
Class now is session, soldier boys, today's aim is
Never show your heat And don't flame it
You playin life, wit a man who lives by the sword
And dies naturally against all common laws

The Best Thing Yet,UnKnown,UnKnown,"One, two..
One, two...
This one's for you..
Yeah
I love him more than I love me, trust me
Love at first sight, is there a such thing? There must be
This is how it goes huh? My lil' man growin up
Faster than I'm blowin up, don't wanna hit the road now
Can't even tell him no now
Every line from here on in is for him, put somethin on the flo' now
Rapping ain't accept me 'til the night I met Slim
He was born the same night, tell me that he ain't special
My grandmama died the same night
Same hospital that he was conceived in, God has His reasons
You can probably imagine mournin a death
And rejoicin a life at the same time - but you prol'ly haven't!
Fate has a way that it turns
Had a death, in the family, had a baby, couldn't turn, that away
He knows that his daddy sellin (sellin), records
When he grew, old enough to understand me
You KNOW I had to tell him
 (Royce)
You're the best thing yet (This is for you!)
To ever come in to my liiiiiii-iiiiife, oooh...
You're the best thing yet
To ever come in to my liiiiiii-iiiiife, oooh...
You're the..

For him, I could get so selfish
It's strange how love can make you contradict yo'self
How could I tell him not to steal and, I would steal for him
Tell him killin is wrong and I would kill for him
I told him I would never take myself away from him
I would fight for him, at the same time, I'd do life for him
Jump in front of a slug for him, this is unconditional love
And I wouldn't wish none of the above on him (above on him)
..I best be, on my best behavior
Mistakes made by me don't only affect me
Affects him too, check what I been through

And you givin your fans, verbally what you would get for a crack pipe

Imported from orbit my origins 
Tryin' to  every orifice distorting my oral 
Control me with foreign trends and 
These bars like something out of a brawl fight
For your death we gonna breathe on the mic and evolve life
 in every song that I write
No stars and stripes 'cause my only salute is to Sean Price
I do my thing in this music
The way I'm movin' like K.A. produced it
Drums are abusive 
There's nothing to it for dudes just embrace the movement
Get brutally executed refusing music I pay my dues with
Fucking spazz on these haters
Something I had was patience
Alienated like I came from a damn spaceship
Basically landed on this planet and plantation to fix what you damaged because you rappers just can't save it

This ain't a pop song, this here is the basics
I'm taking these fools back to when dudes was breaking
But don't get it confused, what was in the movie Breakin'
Them niggas was confused and that movie looking 
Fuck you gon' dance for?
I could just  leave him layin' on the dancefloor
This is where I came from, stone washed jeans, shell toes, big 
Same place I got the  from
Bangin' Daddy Kane, DMC just to name some
Thinkin' bout Slick Rick when I get my chains done
All around the world it's the same song
Euros for your vinyl,  some dollars for your ringtone

Hit you while you loadin the clip in the Glock

The only games I play is ""Umi Says"" like Mos Def (nigga)

Over-protected, heed the poet's connections

Put him in his car, drive him to his house, take him out

Did a song where it end at them, that's why they call it a hit
It comes along with the impact
I'm nicer than most, and I ain't from the east or the west
But if I do a show and they give me love, them I'm hyping the coast
Detroit what, that's where I spill heat from
And wherever you at, that's where you feel me from
I got it on lock, the rap game is like a pistol
'Cause you can get in a jam when you should've shot it on 
Do I make you hyped, clap to this
I better live it and dial 3-1-3 and seven digits
I make songs for women, songs for ballers
Songs for niggas in impalas toting revolvers
Songs for stuck up girls, gangbangers who rob and touch up curls
Before they get drunk and hurl
Songs for every borough, songs for rich misses who touch up pearls
And these fucked up girls
Songs for you, songs for him
Songs for niggas who hate boots, and songs for niggas who love timbs",https://genius.com/Royce-da-59-clap-to-this-lyrics

Your breath smell like peaches
What kind of bubble gum you chewing?
How many sit ups a day do you do if you do 'em?
That stomach is looking right
Call your man up and tell him to take a hike

Hello? Hello?
Are you there?


Take you where you never been
You with him you never win
You with me you never lose
Now get rid of them tennis shoes
I'll teach you what you never knew
I'll put you up on a pedestal
Don't think just listen if and when I come and take you there
I don't care if your so young
You was twelve in '01
Your momma will probably kill me
But your father got to feel me

You from the era when the only killing you seen
Was a little nigga named Terry, dancing goofy shit
From your stereo blaster, wifing up groupies
Claiming a gang, when you ain't banging a thang
Giving a thought at STD is the only time you clapping a ratchet
I roll a blunt, and get the masses to match it
Imagine that, use the world as an ashtray, I'm ashin' that, after I rap

I'm tryin' live a life of happiness, fuck all this trashy shit
Give me some flashy shit, 'fore I get scrappy
Slap happy, rap nasty

Act like I ain't even worth a feature?

1977, July 5th
Conceived immaculately was me, my mom's gift
Unwrapped right there in the room like Christmas
My mind has been designed to do light distance
Run whole laps around y'all with my thoughts
You ain't hold back on yours, naw that's my fault
Now picture me fallin, all the way to the bottom
And I'm layin and callin, somebody come help me
Find my strength to stop drinkin this poison
'fore I drown my gift, and yeah it's probably unhealthy
Cause I went so hard and woke up sober
I lost my good friend and broke up soldiers
Loco, goin hard as a locomotive
Self-loathin like I ain't chosen
Chose to bless souls, get exposed
Just know that I ain't foldin, huh
I gotta shake this


September 18th, 2-oh-oh-6
I roll up in the court thinkin ""This should go quick""
On some couple thousand dollar suit type shit
From behind thousand dollar Cartier scripts
I witness my world tumble down like bricks
Two words she slurred, and it sounded like this (this)
One year (one year) travel through the room like moonlight
Through the darkness, ooh it's heartless
How could, I beat two felonies then
Turn around and lose like (lose like) like this!
My lawyer sayin stay calm, people sayin pray for him
They lockin my black ass up, like Akon
My wife at the crib goin crazy
Pregnant, yellin ""I ain't havin no more babies!""
People sayin Preem ain't fuckin with me no mo'
Niggas in the pen' lookin homo, NO!
I gotta shake this


(Yes!) Fresh outta jail feelin like Christopher Walken
The king of my city, swingin my dick as I'm walkin
Up to the 7-50, I open the door
My cuz and like several bitches make up the decor
I look in, he got a company porns
I tell him ""Nah I'm good, I woulda chubbed her before""
I'm a new man but I could fuck with a whore
Nigga my dick's so hard it's probably touchin the floor
Ridin round in the back of a black luxury toy
Gettin sucked, like niggas cannot FUCK with me boy!
When I look in the mirror, all I see is the real
You niggas shouldn't be here, R.I.P. if you will
I'm the moment of truth (truth)
I'm the only significant thing roamin the scene soon as I go in the booth
I'ma do it this time, I'm feelin really defined
Unsigned to signed, nigga the city is mines


Bitch get off me!
Yeah, get off me!

Back when Jigga was twisting, when 50 was fat

I was packing the gorilla lifting them gats

Where that smoke that he blows effective

With extra truth, each song's a whole infection
He knows that each one of your soldiers testing
Didn't see the sign that reads the smoke you section
On my back, right behind the sign on my front
That reads your momma conceives the pumpkin seed

Who want your seed to do anything to get to it

On The Low,The Album,2008.0,"This nigga, Lo, from Illinois was serving him
Had an M.O. for being cold-blooded, but his soul was murderous
He had a thing for doing business with niggas
And flipping the script on ‘em
Soon as they feel he good, he emptying clips on ‘em
If you was rich, homie, it’s iffy
He’ll switch on a nigga so quickly on the low
Shh, ask around about you
Get cool with who you eat with so he could out you
Peep this
Now he posted in Detroit, copped a little hideaway
On the west, the Chi is like a 4-hour drive away
By the way, 8 Mile’s a mile away
That’s where the bar is where the hood stars party like a holiday
Made it there, like I would say, 11 on a Saturday
You slipping, he ain’t here to hear what you got to say
And now he on the low
Walk through, spot a hot nigga
Spot a drunk nigga on his jock with him he can talk to

That your man? Hmm. He’s with you? Hmm
He a troop? Hmm
What he push? Damn. He the shit? Hmm
What he do? Hmm
He got the hoes? Hmm. What’s his name? Nah
Introduce. Oh. Who want to know? Me
I’m low
“I’m the boss, promise you won’t rob him
I promise, but of course you know I have my fingers crossed”

Now he talking to the right hand man of the boss man
Oh boy, they’re slipping, they must be some off-brands
Niggas is telling him everything, he actually thinking
He finna take everything they have and kill ‘em
And then here comes a stripper asking if he want to tip for dancing
He thinking “I could use her to get at this nigga
But on the low”
“Dance for him, I’m paying for him
I’ll give you 50 G’s if you get in his pants, I got plans for him”
That’s all she had to hear, she barely see that a year
She tricking for way less, she gripping the cavalier
She walks up to him like “this dance is on him
Right there in the blue and white, I’m trying to be with you tonight
“Right there in the blue and white, he spending the money, huh
These niggas is too alike, “sit down, let’s kick it on the low
Here’s a grand, the nigga that sent the dance too extra
Let me ask you a couple of questions”

That your man? Hmm. He’s with you? Hmm
He a troop? Hmm
What he push? Damn. He the shit? Hmm
What he do? Hmm
He got the hoes? Hmm. What’s his name? Nah
Introduce. Oh. Who want to know? Me
I’m low:
“I’m the boss, promise you won’t rob him
I promise, but of course you know I have my fingers crossed”

Now the stripper with the boss man, boss man talking ‘bout
Lo trying to get too close, he ‘bout to spark him out
Take whatever money he got after he wet him up
She said “, we could just set him up
How you want to do it? Should I take him to the telly, what?”
“Yes, when you get in there, hit me on the celly on the low”
So she go to Lo, tell him it’s a go
She gon’ get the boss to the telly, come and bring the dough
Here we go, the stripper calls to both of these niggas
To meet her up at the same time and place
They feel as though it’s no time to waste so they hurry up, get there
Don’t look like it shit there, still they’re both prepared
When they see each other they flinch and pull the toast
And the stripper appears with a nigga and tell them both, “get low”
While they’re on the ground getting robbed, ‘bout to be stinking
They see her kiss this nigga, they got to be thinking

That your man? Hmm. He’s with you? Hmm
He a troop? Hmm
What he push? Damn. He the shit? Hmm
What he do? Hmm
He got the hoes? Hmm. What’s his name? Nah
Introduce. Oh. Who want to know? Me
I’m low
(“I’m the boss, promise you won’t rob him
I promise, but of course you know I have my fingers crossed”)

Pushin' the Benz in Germany with the funny numbers (Yes)
We fly in the streets like it's the Autobahn
Y'all niggas watch me cop jewelry, then y'all go pawn
Tipsy in Sicily with the Gucci goggles on
Determined to see the bottle gone, lookin' like I belong
If you ain't afraid, it's time to get your startle on
I'll let ya'll wear the wire, I just get my Marlo on
