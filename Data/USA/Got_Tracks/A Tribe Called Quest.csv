Description of a Fool (Talkie),Revised Quest For The Seasoned Traveller,1989,"""Fool"" - defined in Webster's
Open up the book, read it, read it
Turn the page, see what it says
Read it to me will you, please
(One who acts dope doltishly
So what? What does it mean to me?)
That's you (How's that?) ‘Cause of the way you act (Huh?!)
Standing on the corner sellin’ jumbos (What you talkin bout?)
Scaring your friends and also your foes
What's the matter wit'cha boy? (Ain't nuttin wrong with me, mother...)
You big galoot (Huh?), you nincompoop (What?)
What's wrong wit you? You can't compute (Yes, sure I can compute)
Don't fix your lips to tell me you can
Standing on the boulie playin pusherman
What you got to do with yourself? (Oh what?)
Can't you be somebody else? (Sure)
Look at you, described to a tee (Huh)
You're a fool of many in society (Crazy)
I know some more, I shall go on
And continue in the song, fooled the fool
""Fool"" - scratched by Ali Shaheed Muhammad
(Man I don't know what you're talkin bout callin me a fool
I've been out here for twenty-some-odd years
Doin’ my thing, I ain't no fool, man
You crazy or something?
I'm gonna stick this, right up your...)

The girl I talked to she's sort of neurotic (Yeah)
Her crazy ex-boyfriend is really psychotic (Uh-huh)
Scares the girl by threatening her life (word)
Says ""Girl, you're dead if you're not my wife"" (Oh man)
Beats in her public, beats her in private (Yeah)
Tried it 'round me, almost a riot (What you gonna do?)
Said ""Forget him, don't you know he's a loser
Who would love a woman turn around and abuse her?”
Only a fool as described by the Tribe
Here's another one who's on the fool vibe (Okay)
Gonna make it short, gonna make it quick (Why?)
For this situation makes me sick (Oh)
See your brother man, with the female (Yeah)
He's crazy ego tried to show he'll prevail (Uh-huh)
In any situation, lady luck's on his side (Word)
Emotions run free, nothing he will hide
Why I remember one sunny day (Yeah)
Took my cousin to the park so we can play (Yeah)
On the way, a couple resembled
The one I just described, everything assembled
Another young man walked in their direction (Yeah)
Bumped him a bit, excused his imperfection (Mmm-hmm)
But the man with the lady grabbed the other by the neck (Mmm-hmm)
Demanded an apology and also respect (Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm)
The young man aggravated grabbed him back and smacked him
The girl just laughed and laughed and laughed at him (Oh, man!)
He felt ashamed for what he had done
It looked like a fool to everyone (OH!)
These are three stories from the naked city (Yeah)
Reality, is sometimes saditty (Yeah, uh-huh)
Like Rod Serling from The Twilight Zone
Earth to your brain - is anyone home? (What you talkin bout?)
I see ya there, tryin to make amends
Try to make some friends, but now my story ends (Oh, man!)
On the note, that I just wrote
Stay afloat on the reality boat (Oh)
Slow down and think and take it cool
And try to avoid the description of a fool

Man, Tip, you think you all that now that you on wax
Or something that you can tell a brotha what to do?
You know I’m older than you? I’m your senior, brotha
Man, you better go someplace with that old fool nonsense
I’m gon’ keep doin’ what I gotta do
And survive the way I gotta survive, know’m’sayin’?
You can’t do nuthin’, can’t do nuthin’, man
Know’m’sayin’? I’ve been out here too long doin’ my thing…",https://genius.com/A-tribe-called-quest-description-of-a-fool-talkie-lyrics
If The Papes Come,Can I Kick It? (Single),1990,"The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away
But not Hip-Hop yo
And let it be known that we are on some umm
Ehh ahh, uhh, a-chicka-uhh
Ehh ahh, uhh, a-chicka-uhh
And this ain't on the pop tip yo
Are y'all kids tucked in?
(Yeah!)
Here we go..

People in the audience they cry out ""ho""
People with a gun, yo they'll cry out ""bo!""
I don't like a cop, I don't sell a rock
But still the kanga's clock me after a show
Standing on the stage dripping, pouring with sweat
To people in the crowd I give what they get
Papers make paid, babies make laid
I don't really worry nor do I fret
Waiting for the gimme and boy I got some
Sweet like a peach and tart like a plum
I thought what I think, I rock a bead link
Legally I sip when I turn twenty-one
A letter to the homeboy that freaked the head dome
The army wants me to drop my microphone
Gotta be brief, no orders from a chief
Hot butter on what, say what, the popcorn
On the tour bus we hit the truck stop
A dollar for some chips, a quarter for some pop
We laugh and giggle some, Phife gets the honeybuns
Ali Shaheed Muhammad keeps talking that shop
The brothers cruise on as we quest for the check
Calling up Famous to see if it's there yet
Not a bourgeoise, hate the seminar
Ignorant flip, hey miss you must jet
Flex for the funkiest, butts start to bounce
Measure Hip Hop for weight, by the ounce
Bush on the tush, you're pulling while I push
Play me for the punk then puss, feel the pounce

It's like that y'all (keep on)
Freak freak y'all (keep on)
(Repeat x4)

A young baby brother growing up in the world
Used to be a bottle now a 40 and a girl
Standing on the corner cold chilling, talking shit
Wake up in the morning fix a plate of hominy grits
Change my diaper, clean my pacifier
Smoke to get higher if I would like to jump
Muhammad drum machining, dust it off clean and
Make a funky beat to keep the street steaming
Look from the heart and cold living lum
Good from the start like a newborn nun
Eat to get fatter, but that don't matter
Born out in Brooklyn and that's where I'm from
May 22nd out on Ocean Ave
From around the way so I be knowing the half
Peace to Sweet Daddy and on to Mike G
The harder they come is as hard as we be


If the papes come yo yo I won't riff
I'll just sit down and get me a spliff
With mines I was born, a child of the corn
Molecules of the land they uplift
Levels is straight, in fact they're rectified
Adrenaline now is crazy multiplied
Four and four is eight, if fat shit makes the plate
I make sure the Tribe is in
With the quickness you bear the witness
Flexing and pumping with the fitness
Moving it - uh, doing it - uh
Those who oppose must hit the s-list
Doing it, doing it with the whole frame
Look what's in the mind and not in the brain
On this you can quote, we on a diffy note
Quest for the future, 'stead of the fame
One ninety-one brothers grabbing they thingies
Forgot the name, oh, equivalent to Jimmy
Hiddle-iddle-it, you think I have to quit
Ali Shaheed Muhammad, with the singy-singy
Slamming with a slammy you front, on the case
Right or left nut Ali plays the ace
Do what you do, flam for a crew
Bonita Applebum blows smoke in Sha's face
Slang for the kang, you must if you have
Dribble hops out giggle yo proper term is laugh
Brothers who are snakes, I label them as fakes
Instincts to travel up the hood path, c'mon


Thank you

Well, I'm gone (Go on then!)

Can I kick it? To all the people who can Quest like A Tribe does
Before this, did you really know what live was?
Comprehend to the track, for it's why cuz
Gettin measures on the tip of the vibers
Rock and roll to the beat of the funk fuzz
Wipe your feet really good on the rhythm rug
If you feel the urge to freak, do the jitterbug
Come and spread your arms if you really need a hug
Afrocentric living is a big shrug
A life filled with fun that's what I love
A lower plateau is what we're above
If you diss us, we won't even think of
Will Nipper the doggy give a big shove?
This rhythm really fits like a snug glove
Like a box of positives it's a plus, love
As the Tribe flies high like a dove

Can I kick it? To my Tribe that flows in layers
Right now, Phife is a poem sayer
At times, I'm a studio conveyor
Mr. Dinkins, would you please be my mayor?
You'll be doing us a really big favor
Boy this track really has a lot of flavor
When it comes to rhythms, Quest is your savior
Follow us for the funky behavior
Make a note on the rhythm we gave ya
Feel free, drop your pants, check your ha-ir
Do you like the garments that we wear?
I instruct you to be the obeyer
A rhythm recipe that you'll savor

I Left My Wallet in El Segundo,People’s Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm,1990,"Toqué ese guitarra!

I left my wallet in El Segundo
I left my wallet in El Segundo
I left my wallet in El Segundo
I got to get it, I got, got to get it
I left my wallet in El Segundo
I left my wallet in El Segundo
I left my wallet in El Segundo
I got to get it, I got, got to get it

My mother went away for a month-long trip
Her and some friends on an ocean liner ship
She made a big mistake by leaving me home
I had to roam so I picked up the phone
Dialed Ali up to see what was going down
Told him I pick him up so we could drive around
Took the Dodge Dart, a '74
My mother left a yard but I needed one more
Shaheed had me covered with a hundred greenbacks
So we left Brooklyn and we made big tracks
Drove down the Belt, got on the Conduit
Came to a toll, and paid and went through it
Had no destination, we was on a quest
Ali laid in the back so he can get rest
Drove down the road for two-days-and-a-half
The sun had just risen on a dusty path
Just then a figure had caught my eye
A man with a sombrero who was 4 feet high
I pulled over to ask where we was at
His index finger he tipped up his hat
El segundo, he said, my name is Pedro
If you need directions, I'll tell you pronto
Need a civilization, some sort of reservation
He said a mile south there's a fast food station
Thanks, señor, as I started the motor
Ali said ""Damn, Tip, what did you drive so far for?""

Well, describe to me what the wallet looks like

Anyway a gas station we passed
We got gas and went on to get grub
It was a nice little pub in the middle of nowhere
Anywhere would have been better
I ordered enchiladas and I ate 'em
Ali had the fruit punch
When we finished we thought for ways to get back
I had a hunch
Ali said: pay for lunch, so I did it
Pulled out the wallet and I saw this wicked beautiful lady
She was a waitress there
Put the wallet down and stared and stared
To put me back into reality, here's Shaheed
""Yo Tip man, you got what you need?""
I checked for keys and started to step
And what do you know, my wallet I forget

It was a brown wallet, it had props numbers
It had my jimmy hats, I gotta get it man

Lord, have mercy
The heat got hotter, Ali starts to curse me
I feel bad but he makes me feel badder
Chit-chit-chatter, car starts to scatter
Breaking on out, we was northeast bound
Jetting on down at the speed of sound
Three days coming and three more going
We get back and there was no slack
490 Madison, we're here, Sha
He said, ""all right, Tip, see you tomorrow
Thinking about the past week, the last week
Hands go in my pocket, I can't speak
Hopped in the car and torped' to the shack
Of Shaheed, we gotta go back
When he said ""Why?,"" I said ""We gotta go
'Cause I left my wallet in El Segundo""

I left my wallet in El Segundo
I left my wallet in El Segundo
I left my wallet in El Segundo
I got to get it, I got, got to get it
I left my wallet in El Segundo
I left my wallet in El Segundo
I left my wallet in El Segundo
Come on, let's go

Come on, let's go
Come on, let's go

Luck of Lucien,People’s Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm,1990,"Brother, brother, brother, Lucien, you're like no other
Listen very close 'cause I don't like to boast
Instead, I'll tell the tale of a French who prevailed
Through the Mr. Crazy Rabbits who were always on his tail
We ain't on sale, your rumor starts to wail
Get caught with stolen goods and you will go to jail
If you go to jail, then who will pay the bail?
Deport you back to France on a ship with a sail
Escargot, Lucien, you eat snails
(Hey yo Tip, what's wrong with snails?)
From the Zulu nation, from a town called Paris
Came to America to find liberty
Instead of finding pleasure, all you found was misery
But listen, Lucien, you have a friend in me
Oh, luck-luck will drive your butt batty
Next time you get some wheels, make it a Caddy
In terms of doing good, I know you wish you really could
But listen, brother man, I really think you can
Succeed with the breed of the brothers on your back
It's the creme de la creme, and you can vouch for that
It'll take a minute, rice, so take my advice
Trust in us, and thus you trust in your life
Lucien, Lucien, Lucien, Lucien
You should know!

- What? Oh Tip, man, why you do that to me, man?
I though he was a friend, bruh
Oh man, can't believe that
Oh, why you do that to me?
I wouldn't do it like this
I couldn't do it by myself
Yo, it's  it to my 

Are you ready, Lu? This one is for you
Comin' from a true-blue, fits like a shoe
""¿Cómo está usted?"" or ""Comment allez-vous""
Lucien, I'll leave it up to you
Voulez-vous? (vous)
Rendez-vous (vous)
Coucou (cou)
Les poupous (pou)
Watch that lass, gonna backlash fast
Can you get a grip on the crackhead dip?
Sold you a paper bag, guess he saw you comin'
VCR from a neck-bone bummin'
$10 brother, he was hummin' and strummin'
Only had 20, he was livin' like ya slummin'
Gave him the money, well, I thought that was somethin'
Lookin' like a kid who was lost in crumbin'
Don't worry about a thing, I won't get specific
This is a song that is long and prolific
Think of the stuff that I said if you can
Figure it out, compute, understand
No problemo, I'll help you with your demo
If you go to the store for me
Lucien, I'm just kiddin'
You should know!

- Hey, yo, wassup' man? What's your name?
- What kind of accent is that?
- It's a french accent, you know, I'm french, I'm from Paris, don't you think it's sexy?
- No, it's not a sexy accent
- Oh, man ! Give me a try ! You try to kiss me enough? Hun? Oh please what! Love me french, french me love, everybody love my accent! Why nobody like it? Q-Tip  city of Paris. Why is that? Oh! I'm sexy, and I'm french, everybody love my accent, I'm the best, yes, yeah! Je t'aime! I love you! I love you oui, je t'aime! I'll teach you french, I'll make your french good!

You gotta get a grip on the missions you'll be takin'
Not so much the mission, but you got crazy ignition
Sure, the sugar-babies wanna give you a chance
With the French ""savoir faire"" and the sexy glance
But is she really fly, or is she a guy?
I won't ask why, 'cause I know that you try
You try too hard, is that the answer to the riddle?
Instead of doin' so much, why don't you do just a little?
Boy, what a cad, I guess we shouldn't treat him bad
In fact, it would be nice if we understood him like
A case of positionin' the feet in the shoes
Sympathetic reason in the case of the blues
Lucien is blue, even though he's really brown
I had to make the sound, his life is too profound
On the up-and-up, he's somethin' like a little pup
Young and naive, it's hard to believe
As long as you're strong, you can quest with the Questers
Jolly like a jumping bean or a jester
Lucien, Lucien, Lucien, Lucien
You should know!

Oh Tip, everything, you gonna be alright, man
Thank you , man
I think I'll going home, man
Bye-bye, I'll see you tonight
Oh Tip, , I'm not here",https://genius.com/A-tribe-called-quest-luck-of-lucien-lyrics
Push It Along,People’s Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm,1990,"Q-Tip is my title, I don't think that it's vital
For me to be your idol, but dig this recital
If you can't envision a brother who ain't dissing
Slinging this and that, 'cause this and that was missing
Instead, it's been injected, the Tribe has been perfected
Oh yes, it's been selected, the art makes it protected
Afrocentric living, Africans be givin'
A lot to the cause, 'cause the cause has been risen
Some brothers, they be flamming, thinking we ain't slammin'
Coming off like the days when we used to wear the tans and
A blue-collar talker, hemisphere stalker
A glass of OJ and a ten mile walk-a
If you're in a Jeep and you dig what you're hearing
Can I get a beep and a side order of cheering?
I am what I am, that's a tribal man
We all know the colors, we all must stand
As we start our travels, things they will unravel
""Que sera sera"", for this unit is like gravel
Won't be gone for long, listen to the song
If you can't pull it, all ya gotta do is—

Push it along, push it along
Push it along, yeah, push it along
Push it along, push it along
Push it along, yeah, push it along
Push it along, push it along
Push it along, yeah, push it along
Push it along, push it along
Push it along, yeah, push it along

Put one up for the Phifer, it's time to decipher
The ills of the world make the situation lighter
The clock is always ticking, the systems should be kickin'
Like Tip said in ""Ham and Eggs"", I eat chicken, chicken, chicken
Should I release the lever, the lever of the clever
Embellish on the funk as we start to endeavor?
The roots of the rap filling up the gap
With the smash of a hand and a little toe tap

The boom, the bip—the boom-bip
Indicates to the brothers that we be on the flip tip
Phonies start to crumble, funky rhythm rumbles
Through the dance-hall, but my anthem is humble
It's the nitty-gritty, my time is itty-bitty
So I kick the slash for the gipper and the witty
This ain't trial and error, more like tribin' era
Constantly rude as some sort of tribal terror
The street can't depart from the bloody heart
Repair the wear and tear, don't stop 'fore it starts
Won't be gone for long, listen to the song
If you can't pull it, all ya gotta do is—

Push it along, push it along
Push it along, yeah, push it along
Push it along, push it along
Push it along, yeah, push it along
Push it along, push it along
Push it along, yeah, push it along
Push it along, push it along
Push it along, yeah, push it along

Marching off the project, we hope that you will subject
It's good to be an object and never, ever reject
The tribe who meanders with drunken propaganda
Keep it in boom and never will we slander
Redeems should be handed, don't let me demand it
Money gives a nudge to the poet star bandit
Control it, then recluse it, follow, you won't lose it
Mysterious is the tribe for we choose it
Although she's flipping crazy, give my love to Gracie
God, could you help 'cause this Quest is crazy spacey?
The pigs are wearing blue, 
and in a year or two
We'll be going up the creek in a great big canoe
What we gonna do, save me and my brothers?
Hop inside the bed and pull over the covers
Never will we do that and we ain't trying to rule that
We just want a slab of the ham, don't you know, black?
This society of fake reality
Are nothing but a peg of informality
While I sing my song, sing it all day long
If you can't pull it, all ya gotta do is—

Push it along, push it along
Push it along, yeah, push it along
Push it along, push it along
Push it along, yeah, push it along
Push it along, push it along
Push it along, yeah, push it along
Push it along, push it along
Push it along, yeah, push it along",https://genius.com/A-tribe-called-quest-push-it-along-lyrics
Ham ‘N’ Eggs,People’s Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm,1990,"I don't eat no ham n' eggs, cuz they're high in cholesterol
Ay yo, Phife do you eat em? (No, Tip do you eat em?)
Uh uh, not at all (Again)
I don't eat no ham n' eggs, cuz they're high in cholesterol
Jarobi, do you eat em? (Nope, Shah, do you eat em?) Nope
Not at all

A tisket, a tasket, what's in mama's basket?
Some veggie links and some fish that stinks
Why, just the other day, I went to Grandma's house
Smelled like she conjured up a mouse
Eggs was fryin', ham was smellin'
In ten minutes, she started yellin' (Come and get it!)
And the gettin's were good
I said, ""I shouldn't eat it"", she said, ""I think you should""
But I can't, I'm plagued by vegetarians
No cats and dogs, I'm not a veterinarian
Strictly collard greens and the occasional steak
Goes on my plate
Asparagus tips look yummy, yummy, yummy
Candied yams inside my tummy
A collage of good eats, some snacks or nice treats
Apple sauce and some nice red beets
This is what we snack on when we're questin'
(No second guessin')

I don't eat no ham n' eggs, cuz they're high in cholesterol
Ay yo, Phife do you eat em? (No, Tip do you eat em?)
Uh uh, not at all (Again)
I don't eat no ham n' eggs, cuz they're high in cholesterol
Jarobi, do you eat em? (Nope, Shah, do you eat em?) Nope
Not at all

Bridge!

Now drop the beat, so I can talk about my favorite tastings
The food that is the everlasting
See I'm not fasting
I'm gobbling, like a dog on turkey
Beef jerky, Slim Jims, I eat sometimes
I like lemons and limes
""And if not that, I get the Roti and the Soursop""
Sit back, relax, listen to some hip-hop

Gum drops and gummy bears tease my eyes
A sight for sore ones and some bore pies
And other goodies that are filled with goop
With fried apple roots
Delectable delights, control my appetites
Mines is for me, right, but I know what I like
Chicken for lunch, chicken for my dinner
Chicken, chicken, chicken, I'm a finger lickin' winner
When breakfast time comes, I don't recognize
Pig in the pan or a pair of bogey chides
Mixed with stewed tomatoes, home fried potatoes
Or anything with flair, cook it, I'm in there
Pay attention to the Tribe as we impose
This is how it goes

I don't eat no ham n' eggs, cuz they're high in cholesterol
A yo, Phife do you eat em? (Nah, Tip do you eat em?)
Uh uh, not at all (Come again, y'all)
I don't eat no ham n' eggs, cuz they're high in cholesterol
Jarobi, do you eat em? (Nope, Shah, do you eat em?)
Nope, not at all
I don't eat no ham n' eggs, cuz they're high in cholesterol
Afrika do you eat em? (No, Pos, do you eat em?)
Hell yeah, all the time
I don't eat no ham n' eggs, cuz they're high in cholesterol
Phife, do you eat em? (Nah, Tip, do you eat em?)
Uh uh, not at all
I don't eat no ham n' eggs, cuz they're high in cholesterol
Jarobi, do you eat em? (Nope, Shah, do you eat em?)
Nope, not at all
I don't eat no ham n' eggs, cuz they're high in cholesterol

After Hours,People’s Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm,1990,"After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool

Ten after one I think I'll hop the horse
Downtown '83 of course
Just came from fishing, couldn't get a catch
Downtown they'll probably have a batch
A whiting sandwich and a Guinness Stout
But with the beer though I had a bout
So I exchanged it for some apple juice
I had the blues but I shook them loose
A jeep is blasting from the urban streets
Loops of funk over hardcore beats
The moon dabbles in the morning sky
As the minutes just creep on by
I get a thought and here comes my Tribe
Ritual shakes and in good vibes
Like always the Quest begins
In the mist though but the rhythms moving
We find a spot and we sit and chat
Speaking on the status quo of rap
A derelict makes a real long speech
We pay attention to the words he read
When he was done we rattled on
There was no rush because it wasn't dawn
We pointed things out about these times
The worlds famines and the crazy crimes
Inflation of the nation, it bothers me
I better go gold, to pay the taxes
Gotta be swift 'n society
The man whose made is the man who maxes
The grounds for living are being discussed
As we go, it gets close to dusk
Gather thoughts and savor breath
'Cause there's only a few hours left

After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool

Me oh my, hey-hey, hey-hey
The human hours are here to stay
This is how it seems as Phife's my witness
Bug out all night, ask Phife, he's with this
Girls be screaming on this conversation
I have my two cents for a revelation
And my watch continuously tick-tocks
Shaheed will bring up the beats that rocks
I hear the frogs and the smashing of bottles
A car revs up and I hear it throttle
It probably moves with the morning wind
Oh my God, here's Phife again
Hear him talking about last night's game
Trying to remember someone's name
So hear the frogs dancing in the streets
Once again Ali will bring up the beat
Like this

*
sounds of frogs

The beat is over and so is the night
The sun is risen and the shine is bright
We all say peace and go our separate ways
Youth is fading as we gain our days
Expedition for the song is simp'
The hours creep, excuse me, I mean limp
As we go you hear a gasp of laugh
As we start up our rhythmic path
Like this

After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool",https://genius.com/A-tribe-called-quest-after-hours-lyrics
Footprints,People’s Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm,1990,"As we start trudging
Me and my brothers we be looking and be bugging
Vehicles of life they be rolling and be nudging
Searching for the virgins of life
That be shoving out the door that's crack
The valleys of time, are always on my feet
As least the beat will combine
The calluses and corns with the funky bassline
You don't need Underdog for a nickel shoeshine or the shoes that's phat
But can I get a level on the bass and on the treble?
Footing up and down like a UNLV Rebel
The answer be amongst us 'cause we really dig acoustics
Can't be too much flacking, not too much packing
You must container that at least to dip your hand in rap
Your feet will be infectious so at least realize the fact
The rhythms are inserted and the nurse can be converted
This ain't rock 'n' roll 'cause the rap is in control
If you're a megastar, words will buy you a car
I'd rather go barefooting, for prints I will be putting
All over the earth if we can get there first
Now that we are in it, footprints are being printed
So if you recognize 'em, you can try to size 'em
They'll probably be the ones with the size nine flying
All over the field, you won't have to yield
If you want protection you can hide behind the shield

And the musician often tries to capture the new thing so that we might have melody and have rhythm as we do our thing
It's rough and tough in this ghetto, a lot of funny stuff going down but you got to walk tall. Walk tall!

You can game on the gallons if you really need to rock
But we walk while we talk as we stomping through the block
Hand in hand 'cross the land as Muhammad cross the fade
It's a Tribe who meanders, precious like a jade
It's a art, Theo arch rhymes the ground placed upon
The mind will unwind, it will soft to beyond
Catch the track, track by track, get a map to track a trail
You will find yourself behind for a map does not prevail
See the levels peaking as the rhythms keep-a screeching
A Quest, oh yes a Quest, inside the jam I will keep preaching
The point, oh yes the point, because it's close but yet so far
The liveliness is mean as we scoot across the star
We are bulging, I'm indulging in a rat-a-tat-tat
Explanation for the line is that the rhythm is phat
Keep it wild, wide and deep, you could dig it in a Jeep
But dig it in the ground because the footprint now

Walk tall!

If there's a storm that's brewing, it won't keep us from doing
Our thing as we start swinging, travelling is bringing
Joy inside the domes as we hit the road to Rome
A chair is not a chair, a house is not a home
Because my skin is brown, yo I'm gonna do the town
Rub it in the face and rub my feet all through the place
When you get your finger on the music it'll linger
Sing a song o' sixpence, sing it like a singer
A Nubian, a Nubian, a proud one at that
Remember me, the brother who said ""Black is black""
You can come while we Quest, I don't play, I don't jest
Get emotions off your chest, we are Black, we been blessed
Making moves, making motions, flowing like an ocean
The walking will continue, we know that we will bring you
The times that you have waited, more anticipated
Be gone but not for long because the feet will stay strong",https://genius.com/A-tribe-called-quest-footprints-lyrics
Pubic Enemy,People’s Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm,1990,"Check this out, Kool DJ Red Alert
With my man, Q-Tip

In the morning, woke up from sexual pleasures
Looked at her sexual partner
Who acquainted her acquaintance
Five hours ago at a disco
She went lower than low, into limbo
A thought crossed the mind, her, a bimbo
She answered no, so she had to go—on with the program
Credence, it seems that I've forgotten your name
But it seems that she's done the same
And now something has happened
Suddenly, she's been distracted
By something that has been attracted
She poked and poked and smacked at it
Then she broke down and she scratched it
Now, I think you understand
Clinic, saw the doctor flex his biceps
Then he picked up a pair of forceps
Her pretty face showed fright
Right then and there, she fainted
A really grim picture is painted
The brotha who she acquainted
Was the enemy, scary ain't it?
The Pubic Enemy

YEAH!
Let me tell you more about pubic enemy
Ay, Q-Tip...

Old King Cole was a merry old soul
Had a lady queen, married since 18
He protested, that he was infested
Get lots of love and he couldn't digest it
All propaganda, one big fat lie
Cuz I see the king with my very own eye
Schemed and schemed like a crack fiend king
And poppin up on the teammates scene
And poppin and pimpin on hunnies with moneys
Whole situation to me, was kinda funny
He hold the crown but not the jimmy hat
Now he wears a frown and the jimmy hates that
So the fair maiden in the royal bedroom
Caught the king scratchin, so she had to assume
That he got vicked by the enemy's trick
The thought of cheatin made the maiden so sick
That she screamed and screamed, went on and kept screamin'
Threw a pot and his dome was beamin'
You could hear him yellin in the motherland
""Baby, baby please. Baby, understand.""
She ignored and walked through the gate
The king is in the kingdom to await his fate...of the enemy
The Pubic Enemy

Propmaster—yeah?
Please listen to me—what?
Something lurkin by the Jimbrowski
Who? Jenny?
No, not propulated
A horrible creature that must be penetrated
He gets all into ya, then he tries to do ya
You better run fast, he's gonna pursue the...
What? Yo listen here. Propmaster whiz, no one fears...
Okay, bro, just thought I'd let ya know
How he lives and how he go
Watch yourself when you're out on the run
The enemy is missed, we'll have too much fun
There's four friends of mine that thought they were bad
And laid up this girl, so now, they're sad
They scratched and scratched like it was Saturday and...

Listen here, this is Cool DJ Red Alert
Known as the true, the only, the very one, the Propmaster
There's only one thing I gotta tell ya
There's a whole lotta propmasters out there
You know what I mean?
Shaheed a propmaster, Q-Tip a propmaster
The Jungle Brothers a propmaster
BDP a propmaster
45 King a propmaster
I won't tell you nuthin' bout the ladies
They ain't no propmaster
But you know who's the main propmaster—ME!",https://genius.com/A-tribe-called-quest-pubic-enemy-lyrics

Mom's got no back, says I'm frontin
Call me Smiley, cuz I'm wiley
Living life like the life of Riley
Smokin' blunts with a boy named Bud
We cough up your lungs, cough up your cud
Put out fires, with a 40, ounce of water
You know you oughta
Dance to this, the girl you kiss
I like fried foods, especially fish
Afrocentric, I'm electric
Socialistic and eccentric
Body's healthy, mind is wealthy
Thoughts, they flow, that will propel me
To be a Native, get creative
Original and designative
Listen to the line that's playin'
Listen hard to what Q's sayin'
Politicians are magicians
Make your vote, they hope your wishin'
Ambiguous words, senseless verbs
They all amount to crap that's heard
Violent hip hop, money flip flops
Promoters won't book, but it still rocks
I'm a Zulu, yes, a true blue
Red Alert is with the poo-poo
Ozone layer, loses flava
Here's the edge that you will savor

The economy... Politics... Police... Everything
Except for the youth
But the youth about to come back

Alright, here they come
Uh oh, uh oh, uh!

With expressions and I'm guessin
19 years is a youthful lesson
Fallin skies babe, open eyes babe
Can't you see what lays inside babe

Rhythmic lovin, my profession
Hips, they gyrate, scripts I narrate
No banana, I ain't a primate
Ain't no Soul Glo, just an afro

Quest together, to lands of never
Sleet and snow and storms can't sever
Tribe is growin, never know when
For this time, six necks may show in
Dialogues have been accepted
Negatives have been rejected
That's the music, negro music
Is here for all, so you must choose it
Phonies fondle, watch it throttle
3-6-5 straight out the bottle
Bustin caps, finger snaps
I prefer the second for ghetto tracks
Phife, Jarobi, Ali told me
Get the force like Wan Kenobi
Force his teachin, beats are screechin
Poly plateaus, we aim for reachin
Tribalization, freaks the nation
A mass of peers in celebration
Hopes been real high, since the knee high
Days of youth, feelin good and real spry
Avid combos, hear those bongos
Boom cacka boom, that's how they go
We ain't nomads, but we real glad
Hip hop slams through the nineties, no fad
As a rhythm, have been given
Hurry up, become, we breakin out, out

With a rhythmic instinction to be able to travel
Beyond existing forces of life

Rhythm (Devoted to the Art of Moving Butts),People’s Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm,1990,"It's a new decade
The Native Tongues are about to proceed with the usual lingo
The usual rhythm

Devoted to, the art of moving butts
The rhythm's happening, and it's moving up
The Tribe has been on hold for much too long
Don't fear the rhythm because it's strong
On the corners, brothers bop their heads
From the high-tops to the natty dreads
I'm a nubian y'all, look what we did
Took the crust away from the third eyelid
Now it's kinda open, longs to see the sight
Rhythms of the Tribe which is passed outright
Night after night, day after day
Questing for the rhythms of the Native Tongue way
Rhythm is the key as we open up the door
Things a B-boy has never seen before
Poly-rhythm addict with a big fat boom
You have an eargasm as you start to consume
The ghetto beat with a ghetto poem
Yeah, it's from the heart, 'cause it's from the home
Jarobi, Phife, Ali Shaheed
Call me Koala, got what you need
You're a disc jock, then jock this
Rhythms can't lose, rhythms can't miss
If you feel uptight and you need to freak
It'll be alright once we drop this beat

I got the rhythm, you got the rhythm

I got the rhythm, you got the rhythm

Ma Massa-ya, Ma Makossa
Gets hectic, freak a bourgeois
We quest around for the musical heart
On avenues, streets and boulevards
Not selling out, that's a negative
Loving Hip Hop, loving heritage
Got the instinct to travel miles and miles
Gotta whole lot of rhythm, piles and piles
Now you're kinda with it, wanna get the funk
From the Zulu Nation, topping all the junk
Standing on the top like the Temptations said
Rhythms are obese, yeah, you gotta keep 'em fed
Read what I read, can't be better said
Tribe'll lick motions dabble in the head
Sweetback's bad, not as bad as a beat
It's a (stone groove baby)
Continue, on the windy road
But, I'm lugging, a crazy big load
Will we be on point for the ninety dec
Is it muscle bound and will it flex?
But trudging, we are used to
You don't Quest alone, Quest with a crew
We're four, once more, must make the tracks
You see four fronts, but now you see four backs

I got the rhythm, you got the rhythm
I got the rhythm, you got the rhythm
I got the rhythm, you got the rhythm

Don't you worry

All I wanna do is get down y'all
Have a ball y'all and freak freak y'all
Lifeless ventures ain't new boo
So don't boo hoo, yeah, you too
Gotta get a grip like culture
Swoop down, swoop down like a vulture
The rhythms will lurk into people
All funk ain't created equal
Lookin for the beat to rupture
Like the rapture, gotta capture
Don't let the storm of life scare ya
Get funky, let me prepare ya
For the days of grimness and oppression
Aiyo bro, here's your lesson
Even though the rain starts pourin
Start reachin, start soarin
Don't stop, if you do, you're stallin
Rhythm savior, hear ya callin
Instrumental to be freaky
Go ahead in the rain and you'll see

Can't we make you see
I mean, the fact that is the key, I mean
Devoted to the arts of movin' butts, so get on up and...
Think about what's yours
I mean your culture and your laws
I mean, I label you a sucka
If you're dumber, just stay dumber
But stay in line and keep groovin'
If it's movin, if it's soothin
Don't let a little thing like rain keep you under
Or the thunder, look at wonder
Stomp til your soul is lifted
Get with it, rhythm's with it
Get inside the groove and get nasty
Funky nasty, crazy classy
Money is a first on the list here
It's the good time, it's the good cheer
If you got the ride then ride it
Don't hide it, provide it
Drop, drop, drop down the pants, shake your fanny
Cuz it's handy, not an Annie
Rock to the roll with the hair down
Get the lowdown, rhythm showdown
The simple explanation is nada
Make it hotter, 
thanks, de nada

Tough like a nugget
Listen to The Abstract Poetic, don't snub it
The midnight marauder is the hype beat arranger
Don't front on my lyrics or the tool 'cause it's danger
Hook you like a junkie, you'll flip like a monkey
To the openness of the rhythm, so proceed because I'm funky
I get down, down like a fly hooker's panties
Make you catch a spirit and motivate a fanny
I be the fly poet, rappers, they get jelly
Upset when I rock, 'cause yo, they rhymes is smelly
See, I got it going on like a Forbes tax return
Listening to these lyrics when it's hot will make it burn
Baby burn, baby burn, up into the heavens
The skies up above, the one you think of
Is the highly regarded, hell of the people
Your mic and my mic? Come on, yo, no equal (Word!)
So if ya wanna do it to yourself
That is to mess around with the jazz, then just blame yourself
'Cause you made your bed, so now you lay in it
That's your shit on the floor, then go and play in it
I refuse to catch a 'L' in a battle

I'm still vexed, fuming, gots to come raw
The first punk that tries to flex, I'll be cracking your jaw
I'll mold you, fold you, roll you up like a spliff
Don't ever try for test or else that ass will get whipped
I'm forever poppin' junk, it's like a fat invite
To any MC who wants to flex, yo, we can do this tonight
Gel up my posse up on Linden and 1-9-2
Pull up my brothas from Sayers Ave., the Brooklyn Zoo
All my crew up in Strong Island, so yo, don't sleep
'Cause it only takes a beat to watch that ass get beat
Brothas wanna play rough, but they can all get some
Wanna be hero, but you're a zero, that means you gets none
Don't ever try to step to a kid you can't get with
Why mess with a brotha that your girl once slept with?
I'm a negro, he's a negro, wanna be a negro too?

I'm just a fly MC who's five foot three and very brave
On top remaining, no home training 'cause I misbehave

And before I get the butt, the jim must be erect

With speed, I'm agile plus I'm worth your while
One hundred percent intelligent black child
My optic presentation sizzles the retina
How far must you go to gain respect? Umm...
Well, it's kind of simple, just remain your own
Or you'll be crazy, sad and alone
Industry rule number four-thousand-and-eighty;
Record company people are shady
So kids watch your back 'cause I think they smoke crack
I don't doubt it, look at how they act
Well off to better things like a hip-hop forum
Pass me the rock and I'll score 'em with decorum
And proper—what you say Hammer? Proper
Rap is not pop, if you call it that then stop

NC, y'all check the rhyme y'all
SC, y'all check it out y'all
Virginia, check the rhyme y'all

Buggin’ Out,The Low End Theory,1991,"Yo, microphone check one, two, what is this?
The five foot assassin with the roughneck business
I float like gravity
, never had a cavity
Got more rhymes than the Winans got family
No need to sweat Arsenio to gain some type of fame
No shame in my game cause I'll always be the same
Styles upon styles upon styles is what I have
You wanna diss the Phifer but you still don't know the half
I sport New Balance sneakers to avoid a narrow path
Mess around with this you catch a size eight up your ass
I never half step cause I'm not a half stepper
Drink a lot of soda so they call me Dr. Pepper
Refuse to compete with BS competition
Your name ain't Special Ed
So won't you seckle with the mission
I never walk the street thinking it's all about me
Even though deep in my heart, it really could be
I just try my best to like go all out
Some might even say yo shorty black you're buggin' out

Zulu Nation, brothers last creation
Minds get flooded, ejaculation
Right on the two inch tape
The Abstract poet incognito, runs the cape
Not the best not the worst and occasionally I curse
To get my point across, so bust, the floss
As I go in between, the grit and the dirt
Listen to the mission listen Miss as I do work, umm
As I crack the, monotone
Children of the jazz so, get your own
Smokin R&B cause they try to do me
Or the best of the pack but they can't do rap
For it's Abstract, original
You can't get your own and that's, pitiful
I know I'd be the man if I cold yanked the plug
On R&B, but I can't and that's bugged

Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out

Yo when you bug out
You usually have a reason for the action
Sometimes you do it just for mere satisfaction
People be hounding, always surrounding
Pulsing, just like a migraine pounding
You don't really fret, you stay in your sense
Camouflage your feeling, of absolute tense
You soar off to another world, deep in your mind
But people seem to take that, as being unkind
""Oh yo he's acting stank,"" really on a regal?
A man of the fame not a man of the people
Believe that if you wanna but I tell you this much
Riding on the train with no dough, sucks
Once again a case of your feet in my Nike's
If a crowd is in my realm I'm saying -- mic please
Hip-hop is living, can't yank the plug
If you do the result, will end up kind of bugged

Yo, I am not an invalid although
I used to smoke the weed out
Ali Shaheed Muhammad used to say I had to be out
Scheming on the cookies with the crazy booming back buns
Pushing on them real hard just so we can have the big fun
When I left for road, see, I was Boulevard status
Battling a MC was when Tip was at his maddest
It was one MC after one MC
What the world could they be wanting see from little old me
Do I have the formula to save the world?
Or was it just because I used to
Swipe the women and all the girls
I'm the type of brother with the crazy extended hand, kid
Dissed by all my brothers I was all up what my man did
Supposed to be my man
But now I wonder cause you're feeble
I go out with the strongies and I separate the evils
It's your brain against my mind, for those about to boot out
All you nasty critters even though you see I bug out

Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out

Jazz (We’ve Got),The Low End Theory,1991,"We got the jazz, we got the jazz
We got the jazz, we got the jazz
We got the jazz, we got the jazz
We got the jazz, we got the jazz

Stern firm and young with a laid-back tongue
The aim is to succeed and achieve at 21
Just like Ringling Brothers, I'll daze and astound
Captivate the mass, cause the prose was profound
Do it for the strong, we do it for the meek
Boom it in your boom it in your boom it in your Jeep
Or your Honda, or your Bimmer, or your Legend, or your Benz
The rave of the town to your foes and your friends
So push it, along, trails, we blaze
Don't deserve the gong, don't deserve the praise
The tranquility will make you unball your fist
For we put Hip Hop on a brand new twist
A brand new twist with a whole heap of mystic
So low-key that you probably missed it
And yet it's so loud that it stands in the crowd
When the guy takes the beat, they bowed
So raise up squire, adjust your attire
We have no time to wallow in the mire
If you're on a foreign path, then let me do the lead
Join in the essence of the cool-out breed
Then cool out to the music cause it makes you feel serene
With the birds and the bees and all those groovy things
Like getting stomach aches when you gotta go to work
Or staring into space when you're feeling berserk
I don't really mind if it's over your head
Cause the job of resurrectors is to wake up the dead
So pay attention, it's not hard to decipher
And after the horns, you can check out the Phifer

We got the jazz, we got the jazz
We got the jazz, we got the jazz
We got the jazz, we got the jazz
We got the jazz, we got the jazz

Competition dem try fe come side way
But competition they must come straight way
Competition dem try fe come side way
But competition they must come straight way
How's about that, it seems like it's my turn again
All through the years my mic has been my best friend
I know some brothers wonder, can Phife really kick it?
Some even wanna diss me, but why sweat it?
I'm all into my music cos it's how I make papes
Try to make hits, like Kid Capri makes tapes
Me sweat another? I do my own thing
Strictly hardcore tracks, not a new jack swing
I grew up as a Christian so to Jah I give thanks
Collect my banks, listen to Shabba Ranks
I sing, and chat, I do all of that
It's 1991 and I refuse to come wack
I take off my hat to other crews that tend to rock
But the Low End Theory's here, it's time to wreck shop
I got Tip and Shah, so whom shall I fear
Stop look and listen, but please don't stare
So jet to the store, and buy the LP
On Jive/RCA, cassettes and CD's
Produced and arranged by the four-man crew
And oh shit, Skeff Anselm, he gets props too
Make sure you have a system with some fat house speakers
So the new shit can rock, from Bronx to Massapequa
Cause where I come from quality is job one
And everybody up on Linden know we get the job done
So peace to that crew, and peace to this crew
Bring on the tour, we'll see you at a theatre nearest you

Hey yo but wait, back it up, hup, easy back it up
Please let the Abstract embellish on the cut
Back and forth just like a Cameo song
If you dig this joint then please come dance along
To the music cause it's done just for the rhyme
Now I gotta scat and get mine, underline
The jazz, the what? The jazz can move that ass
Cause the Tribe originates that feeling of pizazz
It's the universal sound, bless the brothers on the ground
And the ones six below, you didn't have to go
Some say that I'm eccentric cause I once had an orgy
And sometimes for breakfast I eat grits and porgies
If this is a stinker, then call me a skunk, I ask
(""What's, wrong?"") Now check it out

All my peoples in Queens ya don't stop
Now all my peoples in Brooklyn ya don't stop
And all my peoples uptown ya don't stop
That includes the Bronx and Harlem ya don't stop
Now to that girl Ramelle ya don't stop
I said because Ladies First ya don't stop
And to the JB's, ya don't stop
And De La Soul, ya don't stop
To my Brand Nubians ya don't stop
And to my Leaders of the New ya don't stop
To my man Large Professor ya don't stop
Pete Rock for the beat ya don't stop
Everybody in the place ya don't stop
You keep it on, to the rhythm, ya don't stop

Excursions,The Low End Theory,1991,"Back in the days when I was a teenager
Before I had status and before I had a pager
You could find the Abstract listenin' to hip-hop
My pops used to say, it reminded him of Bebop
I said, ""Well, Daddy, don't you know that things go in cycles?
Way that Bobby Brown is just amping like Michael""
It's all expected, things are for the lookin'
If you got the money, Quest is for the bookin'
Come on everybody, let's get with the fly mode
Still got room on the truckload of black boom
Listen to the rhymes, then get a mental picture
Of this black man, and black woman fixture
Why do I say that? 'Cause I gotta speak the truth, man
Doin' what we feel for the music is the proof, and
Planted on the ground, the act is so together
Bona fide strong, you need leverage to sever
The unit, yes, the unit, yes, the unit called the jazz is
Delivering each year an LP filled with street goods
You can find it on your rack in your record store
If you get the record, say your thoughts are adored
And appreciated, 'cause we're ever so glad we made it
We work hard, so we gotta thank God
Dishin' out the plastic, do the dance till you're spastic
If you diss—it gets drastic
Listen to the rhyme, 'cause it's time to make gravy
If it moves your booty, then shake, shake it, baby
All the way to Africa, A.K.A. the Motherland
Stick out the left, then I'll ask for the other hand
That's the right hand, Black man
Only if you are noted as my man
If I get the credit, then I think I deserve it
If you fake moves, don't fix your mouth to word it
Get in the zone of positivity, not negativity
'Cause we gotta strive for longevity
If you botch up, what's in that 
(What?) A pair of Nikes, size ten-and-a-half

We gotta make moves (words)
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)
We gotta make moves (words)
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)

""Time, time is a ship on a merciless sea
Drifting toward an abyss of nothingness
Until it can be recharted for its own destiny
Time is an inanimate object paying and paying and paying for no justification for belief
Time is dancing, boogalooing-away all memories of past—""

We gotta be a winner all the time
Can't fall prey to a hip-hop crime
With the dope raps and dope tracks we move blocks
From the fly girlies to the hardest of the rocks
Musically the Quest, is on the rise
We on these excursions so you must realize
That continually, I pop my Zulu 
If you don't like it, get off the Zulu tip
So what can you do in the times which exist
You can't fake moves on your brother or your sis
But if your sis is a , brother is a jerk
Leave 'em both alone and continue with your work
Whatever it may be in today's society
Everything is fair, least that's how it seems to me
You must be honest and true to the next
Don't be phony and expect one not to flex
Especially if you rhyme, you have to live by the pen
Your man is your man, then treat him like your friend
All it is, is the code of the streets
So listen to the knowledge being dropped over beats
Beats that are hard, beats that are funky
They could get you hooked like a crackhead junkie
What you gotta do is know the Tribe is in the sphere
The Abstract Poet, prominent like Shakespeare
(Or Edgar Allan Poe, or Langston Hughes, or...)

We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)

""—time is running out on black power advocates in the day and white thighed supporters at night
Every time you see them, they're chasin' some white woman with their tongue hangin' out

Excursions",https://genius.com/A-tribe-called-quest-excursions-lyrics
Butter,The Low End Theory,1991,"1988 senior year at Garvey High
Where all the guys were corny but the girls were mad fly
Lounging with the Tipster, cooling with Sha
Scoping out the honeys—they know who they are
I was the b-ball playing, fly rhyme saying
Fly girl getting but never was I sweating
'Cause when it came to honeys I would go on a stroll
Until I met my match—her name was Flo
Yeah, I messed around with the one called Flo
All the troopers 'round the way used to call her a ho
But deep down in my heart I knew that Flo was good to go
'Cause I thought it was me like Bell Biv Devoe
But little did I know that she was playing with my mind
The only thing I learned is good girls are hard to find
I feel like Heavy D, I need somebody for me
Not someone whose mind is blank and tryna juice me for my banks
Swinging with my main man Lucky behind my back
What type of crap is that—yo, how's about a smack?
Word life, I can't front, thought I was all that
But now it seems, I've met my match
I was a stone cold lover, you couldn't tell me jack
Settling down with one girl, wasn't trying to hear that
I had Tonya, Tamika, Sharon, Karen
Tina, Stacy, Julie, Tracy
Used to love 'em, leave 'em, skeeze 'em, tease 'em
Find 'em, lose 'em - also abuse 'em
My whole attitude was new day, next hon
And believe it or not, they all got done
Well here comes Flo with the crazy whip appeal
And I'm all true man like Alexander O'Neal
Is this really love, then again how would I know
After all this time trying to be a super ho
She finally played me, but yo I'd find another
'Cause I got the crazy game and yo, I'm smooth like butter

Ayo, it's like butter, it's like butter baby
It's like butter, it's like butter baby
It's like butter, it's like butter baby
It's like butter, it's like butter baby
It's like butter, it's like butter baby
It's like butter, it's like the butter baby
Not no Parkay, not no margarine
Strictly butter, strictly butter, baby

I remember when girls were goodie two shoes but now they turning freaks
All of a sudden (we love you Phife!) ease off ho, my name's Malik
Phife this, Phife that, where you going, where you at
These girls don't know me from jack, yet I feel like the Mack
You didn't want me then, so yo hon, don't want me now
Here, Here - take the towel, wipe off your brow
And take the contact out your eye, you're far from looking fly
You get an E for effort, and T for nice try
Now tell me what's the reason, for dying your hair
Slum village gold still dangling in your ear
You barely have a neck but still sporting a rope
Four-finger ring just so Phifer can scope
You looked in the mirror, didn't know what to do
Yesterday your eyes were brown but today they are blue
Your whole appearance is a lie and it could never be true
And if you really liked yourself then you would try and be you
If your hair and eyes were real, I wouldn't have dissed ya
But since it was bought, I had to dismiss ya
But if you can't achieve it, then why not try and weave it
If you can't extend it then you might as well suspend it
If you can't braid it, best thing to do is fade it
I asked who did your hair and you tell me, ""Diane made it""
If you were you and just you, talk to you, maybe
But I can't stand, no bionic lady
Trying hard to look fly, but yo, you're looking dumber
If I wanted someone like you I would've swung with Jaime Sommers
You wanna be treated right, see Father MC
Or check Ralph Tresvant, for sensitivity
'Cause I am not the one, I got more game than Parker Brothers
Phife Dawg is on the mic and I'm smooth like butter",https://genius.com/A-tribe-called-quest-butter-lyrics
Verses from the Abstract,The Low End Theory,1991,"I had a dream about my man last night
And my man came by the studio
And his name is...

Busta Rhymes in effect
Shaheed is in effect
Phife Did-awg is in effect
Check it out and give me my 'spect

I'm moving, yes I'm grooving cause my mouth is on the motor
Use the Coast in the morning to avoid the funky odor
Can't help being funky, I'm the funky Abstract brother
Funky in a sense, but I play the undercover
Once had a fetish, fetish for some booty
Now I'm getting funky in my rap and that's my duty
Brothers tend to jock on the style in particular
If you got the ego like some brothers then I'll get with ya
But if I don't pursue, then I just don't give a (fuck)
My motto in the 90's is be happy making bucks
Girls love the jim, cos it causes crazy friction
When it goes up in and fluctuates the diction
I still understand the oomph cause that's what I met her for
I'm hooked on the swing, so just call me the music whore
Women love the voice, brothers dig the lyrics
Quest the people's choice, we driving for the spirit
If you can't hear it, then get the wax utensil
Write my rhymes straight up, don't give it no fancy stencil
The rhymes be getting sweet, we stay away from tart
A perfectionist at work, perking up the art
If you want to battle, I suggest you check your clock
Your demise is coming up and I want your man to watch
Be the prime example, or deeper still the sample
Insignificance, here I'll place you on the mantle
Born up in Harlem, reside down in Jamaica
The girl I used to rock, her moms was a Quaker
Now what does that make her? The evil money taker?
The crazy move faker, I use that to break her

Phife is in the house (ooohh, you know you got going on)
Uncle Mike is in the house (this ain't a R&B song)
Bob Power is in the house (you got it going on)
Tim Latham is in the house (and on and on and on)
Wise Men is in the house
The Brand Nubes is in the house
The J Beez, they in the house
And De La, they in the house

I must regroup my thoughts and kick the next ones for my people
Please don't be deceived by the ugly slice of evil
The world is kinda cold and the rhythm is my blanket
Wrap yourself up in it, if you love it, then you'll thank it
Don't move to rebuttal, wave your hand for action
Some women in the 90's want more than satisfaction
They want keys and Gs, and all those illy things
If you want to, I'll show you, just what the Ab can bring
I keep a tight net with my brothers Ken and Kenny
If the question is of rhymes, then I'll tell ya, I got plenty
The thing that men and women need to do is stick together
Progressions can't be made if we're separate forever
I hooked this funky beat with the loop and the feature
This the funky singing by Miss Vinia Mojica
So listen because the Quest is led through the underground
My people have been oppressed too long, no more will we be down
People tend to riff cause they don't know the mental
People tend to bug cause the beats are hard but gentle
Africano lurks through the body of this youngun'
Play like Bobby Byrd on your back and you're coming to
The house of the jazz, of the funk, of the rhythm
All the goods are welcome, but if you're a villain
I'll just wait and debate, contemplate your arrival
If flexing is your motive, then you don't like survival
The Abstract is speaking, the hard beats is reaching
To Black and Puerto Ricans cause they're butt naked streaking
Through the ever murky streets of the urbanized areas
Blasting out the speakers is the hip hop hysteria

Craig is in the house (ooohh, you know you got going on)
Pete Rock is in the house (this ain't a R&B song)
CL is in the house (you got it going on)
Ultramag is in the house (and on and on and on)
Nice and Smooth is in the house
Big Daddy Kane is in the house
Beatnuts is in the house
Special Ed is in the house

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
And this one goes out to my man
Thanks a lot Ron Carter on the bass
Yes my man Ron Carter is on the bass
And check it out, going into the '91 decade
Up in until the 2000 decade
You gotta say the Quest is on
And goddamn it, yes the Quest is on
And we out!",https://genius.com/A-tribe-called-quest-verses-from-the-abstract-lyrics

Classic example of a (a date rape)
Classic example of a (a date rape)
Classic example of a (a date rape)

Listen to the rhyme, it's a black-ink fact
Percentile rate of date rape is fat
This is all due to the reason of the skeezin
You got the right pickin but you're in the wrong season
If you're in the wrong season, that means you gotta break
Especially if a squaw tries to cry out rape
You be all vexed 'cause she got it goin' on
You don't wanna fight 'cause you know that you're wrong
So instead you rest your head on the arm of the couch
Envision in your head of a great sex bout
Worthy opponent, all you wanna do is bone it
You ask can you kick it, she says you can't stick it
This is the case, the situation is sticky
Should you try to kiss or hint towards a hickey?
Not even, you can ask Steven
If the vibe ain't right, huh, ya leavin
Hit the road Jack and all of that
But if she offers her abode, you'll drop ya load
Right smack dab in the middle
Get the kitten, I got crazy tender vittles

Uh-huh, you know the science; you get buckwild
Runnin' mad games as if your name was Scott Skiles
Or better yet Magic or even Karl Malone
Regardless who it is, your aim is to bone
If she tries to front, that's when you start to diss her
If she's with the program, that's when you start to kiss her
Might as well get to the point, no time to waste
Might as well break the ice, then set the pace
You start to talk nasty, now she's ready to bone
Step out of the shower, throw on cologne
All of a sudden, her sugarwalls tumble down like Jericho
She's hotter than Meshach, Shadrach and Abendego
You listen to After 7, break fool after 10
Do your thing at 12 o'clock and when you go again
There goes round 1, ding, there goes round two
Now tell me what the (fuck) are you supposed to do? Huh
What do you know, when the meow is completed
Girly girl cried rape, yo, I didn't really need it

Sweetheart, we ain't goin' out like that
Sweetheart, we ain't goin' out like that
Sweetheart, we ain't goin' out like that (zulu)
We ain't goin' out like that (zulu)
We ain't goin' out like that

Now baby bust it, if you wanna groove
Me and you can do it, it will be the move
I won't cry over spilled milk
If you won't let me take you to the Hilt
I don't wanna bone you that much
That I would go for the unforbidden touch
I'm not the type that would go for that
I'll have to fetch a brand new cat
Baby, baby, baby I don't wanna be rude
But I know because of your bloody attitude
I know why you act that way
It usually happens on the 28th day
I respect that crazily
When you're done with the pads can you come check me?
This ain't a joint to disrespect you
Because one head ain't better than two

If you take a shit they want to know
And if you're gonna fall, they won't be around, y'all
So you still wanna do the show business?
And you think that you got what it takes?
I mean you really gotta rap, and be all that
And prepare yourself for the breaks
Check it out!

Do you wanna be in the business? (The business)
The ups and downs with the hoes (The business)
Always getting fronted on at shows (The business)
People gotta stick their nose (In the business)

Yo, I gotta speak on the cesspool
It's the rap industry and it ain't that cool
Only if you're on stage or if you're speaking to your people
Ain't no-one your equal
Especially on the industry side
Don't let the gains just glide
Right through your fingers, you gotta know the deal
So Lord Jamar speak, because you're real

They're giving you the business and putting on a show
You're a million dollar man that ain't got no dough
But you got a ho tickets backstage to a show
Sedated and at that fact they elated
Time pass and your ass say ""Where's my loot?""
The reply is a kick in the ass from a leg and a boot
All you wanna do is taste the fruit
But in the back they're making fruit juice
You ask for slack and wanna get cut loose from the label
Not able cause you signed at the table
For a pretty cash advance, now they got a song and dance
That you didn't recoup, ""More soup with your meal?""
Cause this is the real when you get a record deal
And I say...

Aw shucks, look what the cat hauled in
It's Phife Dawg from A Tribe Called Quest, let me begin
Like Chuck D, I got so much trouble on my mind
'Bout these no-talent artists getting signed, they can't rhyme
And if that ain't bad, you got bootleggers
Going out like suckers, motherfuckers
Feel it's time that I let loose the lion
And if not that then I'll commence to head flying
Seems in '91 everybody want a rhyme
And then you go and sell my tape for only $5.99?
Please nigga, I've worked too hard for this
No more will I take the booty end of the stick
Bogus brothers making albums when they know they can't hack it
Cause they lyrics is played like
 
8-Ball jackets
Now tell me I can't tear it up
Go get yourself some toilet paper cause your lyrics is butt

Do you wanna be in the business? (The Business)
People can't walk a straight line in (The Business)
Some of these brothers can't rhyme in (The Business)
A-yo, I'm tryna get mine (The Business)

The party scene is cool, but then again it's all the same
You see the same faces, but at different places
When you're up and riding high everything is palsy-palsy
Get a million pounds and all the skins give you hugs
Well that's cool, I can dig it, it really ain't my bag
Prefer to max on the side and let my pants sag
""Oh, he's a cutie"", yeah, real cute
But I wasn't that cute when I didn't have no loot
Although I hit a pound of herbs, I'm still nice with the verbs
So fuck what you heard
The Born Cipher Cipher Master makes me think much faster
But critics still continue to plaster
My name and discredit my fame
All that shit is game and I don't really give a damn
Eat from the tree of life and throw away the verbal ham

Well, excuse me, I gotta add my two cents in
Don't be alarmed, the rhyme was condensed in
A matter of minutes so it must be told
All that glitters not gold
Everybody wants a deal, help me make a demo
See my name in bright lights, ride around in a limo
My moms keeps beefing (""Boy, get a job"")
But I wanna make jams, damn, I know I'll slam
Huh, well it's not that easy
You gotta get a label that's willing and able
To market and promote, and you better hope
(For what?) That the product is dope
Take it from Diamond, it's like mountain climbing
When it comes to rhyming you gotta put your time in
Get a good lawyer so problems won't pile
You don't wanna make a pitch that's wild",https://genius.com/A-tribe-called-quest-show-business-lyrics
Vibes and Stuff,The Low End Theory,1991,"Let me flaunt the style, I think that the time's near
That we drop Scuds, there won't be no duds here
Rappers play the dumb, kinda on the space tip
But when they hear the jams, they be on the dilsnick
Now I'm not for the rock, I know the territory
Go ahead and try, that's a different story
Similar to Grimm, I could tell a better one
All about a kid, who couldn't rap and didn't run
Stands on the side when the mic is getting dumb
Resorts to bagging Billy, asking could he have some
No never ever, go back and try again man
If you come back, I'll be the first to shake your hand
Competition's good, it brings out the vital parts
The Abstract Poetic, majors in recital arts
Do it for the kids, the elders and the rap peers
We know the job is done when we hear a lot of cheers
Gotta feel the vibes, real from my creation
If the hands clap I'm filled with elation
Here I am ghetto, full with a lot of steam
Think I gotta, I think I gotta, I think I gotta scream
Cause that's how good it feels child
Let your hair down, so we can get buckwild
Do your ill dance, don't think about the next man
We must have unity and think of the bigger plan
Division we will fall, we must stick together, see
I'd like to take this time to say what's up to Kool G
The name is Q-Tip, the Midnight Marauder
Giving nuff respects to Afrika Bambaataa
As a man in the world, I must do my job
Take care of Mama Duke, I won't resort to rob
Bob you'll get your dough, Mase is my witness
Obsessed with the rap, for it's the mental fitness
Like shooting Cee-lo, and always hitting head cracks
The industry is luck, winning with the fake raps
Peace to the crews who pump the real hip hop
Not selling out, from hardrock to disc jock

I don't know what to say, but here I go freak it
If the papes come, then you know I'll seek it
I'm just a short brother, dark skin face
Weigh a buck-fifty, 36 waist
Hair is crazy curly, flip like Mr. Furley
To this day I still believe that no MC can serve me
Brothers try to front, but everybody know
I get more props than the Arsenio Hall Show
Party animal I was, but now I chill at home
All I do is write rhymes, eat, drink, shit, and bone
Found my thrill in Amityville, I'm always in the Island
Fudge and Lucky know the time, they know who keeps 'em smiling
Go out on my own, something that I gotta do
Do what the hell I want and have no one to listen to
I'm prompt with my business and I do things on the double
Yo, I'm out like Buster Douglas, I say peace to MC Trouble
Rest in peace

Word Up, rest in Peace, and you know what else?
We got, we got, we got the vibes
All the people in Long Island, we got the vibes
Brooklyn and Queens, we got the vibes
Uptown and Now Rule, we got the vibes
People Upstate, we got the vibes
If you're in DC, you got the vibes
Maryland, Virginia, Carolina vibes
Out West, we got the vibes
In the Bahamas, we got the vibes
Over in Europe, you know what, we got the vibes
And we gotta keep it alive, it goes um...

Of rap I'm a fan, I've seen a whole lot of slums
Good with the girls, I get a whole lot of 'em
From fat to skinny, Freda to Winnie
Emma to Cindy, Constance to Wendy
Cause I be real friendly, never on the snotty side
I don't brag to brothers about the little papes I got
My vocal styles can vary, the sight is never scary
It's only legendary, my father well prepared me
My job ain't temporary, I'm here for the long shot
Better yet the long term, I don't have a perm
In a way I do, call 'em the perma-naps
I'm crazy slap-happy and I'm scrappy and I'm nappy
When I get the mic in my hand with the crowd in the stands
It's as good as grand like that

Yo, I wanna say peace and dedicate this joint to MC Trouble
And to uh... Trouble T Roy
And to um... Scott La Rock
And to um... Cowboy, you know what I'm sayin?
This is for the slain rappers and the fallen rappers, you know what I'm saying?
This is a special, special, special, special, special dedication
And also to my Pops and also to Vinia's Moms, you know what I'm saying?
You just gotta keep it happy and keep the vibes going

Rap Promoter,The Low End Theory,1991,"It's a fly love song

To the effect of nothing, effective fronting
Is what I don't allow so let me tell you something
I am a bonafide
Not too modest and not a lot of pride
Soon to have a ride and a home to reside
If my mama is sick I'm by her bedside
Used to watch the show on Channel 4 called Riptide
Wash my wears in Tide cause it's too damn cold out-tide
That's how the runnings go
If there ain't no dough then there ain't no show
So take your roly poly fat promoter (ass)
To the Chemical Bank, and get my cash
If you wanna see the people scream and laugh
You best Quest, you ask the Quest, you ask real fast
Cause I don't wanna see 'em, start bucking
Throwing chairs in the air while you be ducking
What what? Don't step to me with that
If you promoting a show make sure it ain't wack
Or else I'm leaving (""Let me tell you"")
I'm leaving (""Let me tell you"")
I'm leaving (""Let me tell you"")
Your wack show

Yo man what's up with that?
Yo don't sweat me
C'mon, five hundred, that was the deal
C'mon man, don't try to play me out
We don't need you, sorry!
And the Abstract rapper says

I want chicken and orange juice, that's what's on my rider
And my occasional potato by Ore-Ida
Don't forget my pastry make sure they're tasty
I'm not the type to be pushy or hasty
See I'm the type of bro that's reared in the ghetto
Took a few shorts before
Now the only ones I take are the ones that I wear
Ain't taking no shorts no more, now
Please act proper 'fore I call the CrimeStoppers
Don't dip on the dough, cause that's a no-no
Make sure you count your money real slow
Be alert, look alive, and act like you know
It's, the 90s, time to make moves
Not, the 80s, do away witcha womb
So what? You got a crew
I got one too, they're called the Brooklyn Zu
Don't break fool, let's be reserved and cool
We don't have to act like we in grade school
Just make sure that we're taken care of
And we'll do a fly show for ya bub, check it out

Look at Miss Elaine who runs the fast lane
Barely knows her name, struck by fame
She just got a Benz, she rides with her friends
Gotta keep her beeper in her purse to make ends
Rollin' down the block, checkin' out the spots
She winks at the cops, always give her props
She knows she's the woman, can't nobody touch her
Hangs with the elite, makes her papes from the gutter
Tried to make my moves on Miss Elaine, she called me young boy
Told her not to diss me I just wants to be your love toy
You young boy? My love toy? I doubt that very highly
Just because you rhyme don't mean I'll let you try me
Business oriented, egos never dented
Always sweet scented, if it's business, she meant it
Distractions never hurt, always did the work
Always was alert, she never got jerked
Queen of the feats, thrive to compete
Love the funky beats while she drove down the street
She was justified, couldn't get a job
Had to feed her family, so she had to play the mob
Pullin' out the oowop, listenin' to doo-wop
(You don't have to say a word)
(*gunshots*) That's all ya heard

Everything is fair when you're livin' in the city
Everything is fair when you're livin' in the city
Everything is fair when you're livin' in the city
Everything is fair when you're livin' in the city

She's not a big kahuna, wish I met her sooner
Instead, I met her later, my love is much greater
Put me on her roster to rid her of imposters
And to sell the buddah for the sexy drug ruler
Love is my motive, now I'm drug promotive
Plus I needed ducats to fill up my buckets
Supplied me with the squeezy to make my life easy
Now I'm missing action for this fatal attraction
But don't you let me catch you with your joint up in these bitches
And don't you even dare to plan a plot upon my riches
'Cause if you play me out, I think I'll let ya be
I'll be damned if I let a brotha try to gas me
I played my cards well, try to live swell
For the G, I would sell, 'cause I was deep in hell
But then I really wasn't, she had a fly cousin
Who would give me booty on the side of my cutie
Elaine, she kinda knew, that I would do the do
But she didn't tear, I did my work with care
That's all that really mattered, her money never splattered
As long as she was paid, she was in the shade
You can't really blame her for holdin' on a flamer
Society taught her, but they didn't tame her
A ten clip salute, hunny here's a troop
She will never stop until she reach the top

Uh, uh, uh, uh

Got our skypagers on all the time
Hurry up and get yours cause I got mine
Especially if you do shows, they come in fine
If you're with a G and you're sipping wine
Eating cacciatore with a twist of lime
Gotta meet your lover at a quarter to 9
Joint by base, then you get your high

If you get your high, then mines is next
The 'S' in skypage really stands for sex
Beeper's going off like Don Trump gets checks
Keep my bases loaded like the New York Mets
At times I miss the pager so you don't get vex
Having bad days like a voodoo hex
Conceptually, a pager is so complex
That I be standing by the phone, ready to flex

Welcome, wel-wel-welcome to the new skypager
Wel-welcome to the new skypager
Welcome to the new skypager, new skypager
Enter telephone number or other numeric message

Uh, so funky
Uh, so funky
Uh, so funky
Uh, so funky

The batteries I use are called Duracell
They last for three weeks so they do me well
Don't be going through no phases, my joint stays on
24-7, from dusk til dawn
If you're in Costa Rica on a sunlit beach
Your greed for the Phifer, I can be reached
A number of importance, I just put it on lock
You leave code '69"", that means you want some (cock)

People tend to think that a pager's foul
Well it kinda is cause it makes me scowl
But it really hurts when you're on the prowl
Brothas know it hurts when you're on the prowl
Grabbin' on my joint cause I'm an eager owl
Get paged by a G or a business pal
My shit is overflowin', they won't allow
Another page, so I'll just end this now

Ayo, put one up for the Phifer, long time no hear from
Suckers walkin' around talking about they could get some
But that vibe is non cypher, no can do
And if you take I fi' joke, then ask the other two
And I proceed to let you know, exactly how to flow
I'm not Lawn Doctor so just seckle with the hoe
Oops...my mistake, I didn't know you went with her
Should I run down the line of all the kids that done hit her?
Don't be bitter, I hear that honey resembles a critter
Heard she likes the two-on-one like my man John Ritter
But back to the subject, you can't catch wreck
You must get respect, to earn respect
Suckers think they could hurt me, 'cause now I wear specs
You're full of jokes, but yo, your name ain't Flex
I got the riches, the bitches, I'm large like a Huxtable
You think you're all that, but your girl's quite doable!
Yeah, I'm tellin' you G, to back up off me
I’m not a man called Hawk, but I ain’t Mr. Softee

Save all the sad songs and the tearjerkers
Niggas step back, it's the lyrical worker
The poems that I create ain't in paperback books
The poems that I create are for hookers and the crooks
My mental is excelling 'cause I dabble in the books
I'm not the one to front on, so suboops-suboops
Yo, I gets the pickin's, I'm such a damn Dickens
If you step to this then the plot just thickens
I'll run you around the track like a bunny and a dog
To me, your just another MC on the log
A link in the chain, fluid on the brain
I boast of hype lyrics, and yours are mundane
See, I can't maintain, especially if you come back
I'm the lyrical master blaster, yeah, I could do that
I could also do your girl, so leave the hoe at home
'Cause when I get done, I'll have her strung on bones
It's the no-joke pressure, that elevates my mind
Make me pick up and go when it's time to drop my rhymes
My title is rock, the 
Abstract Poetic
I'm in the idle mode but my energy's kinetic
So smooth and debonair, special for the ear
Gotta keep my thing in gear
'Cause it's evident and clear that I will rock, rock, rock...

So what, so what, so what's the scenario?
Here we go, yo, here we go, yo
So what, so what, so what's the scenario?

Ayo, Bo knows this (What?) And Bo knows that (What?)
But Bo don't know jack, 'cause Bo can't rap
Well, what do you know? The Di-Dawg is first up to bat
No batteries included and no strings attached
No holds barred, no time for move-fakin'
Gots to get the loot so I can bring home the bacon
Brothers front, they say the Tribe can't flow
But we've been known to do the impossible like Broadway Joe, so
Sleep if you want, Nytol will help you get your Zs, troop
But here's the real scoop
I'm all that and then some, short, dark, and handsome
Bust a nut inside your eye to show you where I come from
I'm vexed, fuming, I've had it up to here
My days of paying dues are over, acknowledge me as in there
(Yeah!)
 Head for the border, go get a taco
Watch me wreck it from the jump street, meaning from the get-go
Sit back, relax, and let yourself go
Don't sweat what you heard, but act like you know

Yes, yes, y'all, (Yes, y'all!)
Who got the vibe? It's the Tribe, y'all (Tribe, y'all!)
Real live, y'all (Live, y'all!)
Inside, outside, come around
(Who's that?) Brown!
So, may I say, call me Charlie
The word is the herb and I'm deep like Bob Marley
Lay back on the payback, evolve, 
rotate the gates (Contact!)
Can I get a hit? (Hit!) Boom, bip
With a brother named Tip, and we're ready to flip
East coast stomping, ripping, and romping
New York, North Cak-a-laka, and Compton
Checka-checka-check it out
The loops for the troops, more bounce to the ounce
And wow-how-now-wow, how now, Brown cow?
We're ill 'til the skill gets down
For the flex, next, it's the textbook, old to the new
But the rest are doo-doo
From radio, to the video, to Arsenio
Tell me, yo; what's the scenario?

(True blue!) Scooby Doo, whoopie doo
Scenarios, radios, rates more than four
Scores for the s'mores that smother dance floors
Now I go for mine, shades of sea shore
Ship-shape, crushed grapes, apes that play tapes
Papes make drakes baked for the wakes
Of an (L-ah-!), an (-eader!), simply just a leader
Base in the space means peace, see ya later
Later (Later!) later, alligator
Pop blows the weasel and the urge to inflate her
So, yo, the D, what! The O
Incorporated I-N-C into a flow
Funk flipped, flat back, first this, foul, fight, fight, fight
Laugh, yo, how'd that sound? (Ooh!)

It's a Leader-Quest mission and we got the goods here (Here!)
Never on the left 'cause my right's my good ear (Ear!)
I could give a damn about a ill subliminal
Stay away from crime so I ain't no 
(criminal!)
I love my young nation, groovy sensation
No time for hibernation, only elation
Don't ever try to test the water, little kid
Yo, Mr. Busta Rhymes, tell him what I did—

—I heard you rushed and rushed (and attacked!)
Then they rebuked and you (had to smack!)
Causing rambunction throughout the sphere
Raise the levels of the boom inside the ear—

—
You know I did it
So don't violate or you'll get violated
The hip-hop sound is well agitated
Won't ever waste no time on a played out ego
So here's Busta Rhymes with the scenario:

Watch; as I combine all the juice from the mind
Heel up, wheel up, bring it back, come, rewind
Powerful impact (Boom!) from the cannon!
Not bragging, tryna read my mind, just imagine
Vo-cab-u-lary's necessary
When diggin' into my library
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!
Eating Ital Stew like the one Peter Tosh
Unh! Unh! Unh! All over the track, man
Unh, pardon me, unh! As I come back!
As I did it, yo, I had to beg your pardon
When I travel through the town I roll with the squadron
Rawr! Rawr! Like a dungeon dragon
Change your little drawers 'cause your pants were saggin'
Try to step to this, I will twist you in a turban
And have you smelling rank like some old, stale urine
Chickity Choco, the chocolate chicken
The rear cock diesel, buttcheeks, they were kicking
Yo, bust it out before the Busta bust another rhyme
The rhythm is in sync (Uh!) the rhymes are on time (Time!)
Rippin' up the sound just like Horatio
Observe the vibe and check out the scenario
Yeah, my man, mothafucka!

With your black hair and your fat-ass thighs
Street poetry is my everyday
But yo, I gotta stop when you trot my way
If I was working at the club, you would not pay
Ayo, my man Phife Diggy, he got something to say

I like 'em brown, yellow, Puerto Rican or Haitian
Name is Phife Dawg from the Zulu Nation
Told you in the jam that we can get down
Now, let's knock the boots like the group H-Town
You got BBD all on your bedroom wall
But I'm above the rim and this is how I ball
A gritty little something on the New York street
This is how I represent over this here beat
Talking 'bout you

Yo, I took you out
But sex was on my mind for the whole damn route
My mind was in a frenzy and a horny state
But I couldn't drop dimes 'cause you couldn't relate

You can be my mama and I'll be your boy

Original rude boy, never am I coy
You can be a shorty in my ill convoy
Not to come across as a thug or a hood
But hon, you got the goods, like Madelyne Woods
By the way, my name's Malik, the Five-Foot Freak
Let's say we get together by the end of the week
She simply said, ""No"", labelled me a ho
I said, ""How you figure?"" ""My friends told me so""
I hate when silly groupies wanna run they yap
Word to God, hon, I don't get down like that

I'll have you weak in the knees that you could hardly speak
Or we could do like Uncle L and swing an ep in my Jeep
Keep it on the down, yo, we keep it discreet
See, I'm not the type of kid to have my biz in the streets

If my mom don't approve, then I'll just elope
Let me save the little man from inside the boat
Let me hit it from the back, girl, I won't catch a hernia
Bust off on your couch, now you got Seaman's Furniture

Shaheed, Phife and the Extra P
Stacy Beadle, PJ and my man LG
They know the Abstract is really soul on ice
The character is of men, never ever of mice
Shorty, let me tell you 'bout my only vice
It has to do with lots of loving and it ain't nothing nice

You can be a black man and lose all your soul
You can be white and groove but don't crap the roll
See my shit is universal if you got knowledge of dolo
Or delf or self, see there's no one else
Who can drop it on the angle, acute at that
So, do that, do that, do that, that, that (come on)
Do that, do that, do that, that, that (OK)
Do that, do that, do that, that, that
I'm bugging out but let me get back cause I'm wetting niggas
So run and tell the others 'cause we are the brothers
I learned how to build mics in my workshop class
So give me this award, and let's not make it the last

We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
Chinatown, Spokane, London, Tokyo
We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
Houston, Delaware, DC, Dallas

Back in '89 I simply slid into place
Buddy, buddy, buddy all up in your face
A lot of kids was busting rhymes but they had no taste
Some said Quest was wack, but now is that the case?
I have a quest to have a mic in my hand
Without that, it's like Kryptonite and Superman
So Shaheed come in with the sugar cuts
Phife Dawg's my name, but on stage, call me Dynomutt
When was the last time you heard the Phife sloppy
Lyrics anonymous, you'll never hear me copy
Top notch baby, never coming less
Sky's the limit, you gots to believe up in Quest
Sit back, relax, get up out the path
If not that, here's a dancefloor, come move that ass
Non-believers, you can check the stats
I roll with Shaheed and the brother Abstract
Niggas know the time when Quest is in the jam
I never let a statue tell me how nice I am
Coming with more hits than the Braves and the Yankees
Living mad phat like an oversized mampi
The wackest crews try to diss, it makes me laugh
When my track record's longer than a DC-20 aircraft
So, next time that you think you want somethin' here
Make something def or take that garbage to St. Elsewhere

We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
SC, Maryland, New Orleans, Motown
We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
Chinatown, Spokane, London, Tokyo
We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
Houston, Delaware, DC, Dallas
We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand

Seven times out of ten we listen to our music at night, thus spawned the title of this program
The word maraud means to loot
In this case, we maraud for ears",https://genius.com/A-tribe-called-quest-award-tour-lyrics
Oh My God,Midnight Marauders,1993,"Listen up everybody, the bottom line
I'm a black intellect, but unrefined
With precision like a bullet, target bound
Just living like a hooker, the harlot sounds
Now when I say the harlot, you know I mean the hot
Heat of the equator, the broth that's in the pot
Jalick, Jalick ya wind up ya hip
Drafting of the poets, I'm the #7 pick
Licks licks licks boy 'pon your backside
Licks licks licks boy 'pon your backside
Listen to the fader, Shaheed lets it glide
Tip the earthly body, heaven's on my side
Even in Santo Domingo when I got a Gringo
We got mics, when do we go?
Know a little nigga who can rhyme when you ask me
Short, dark, and plus his voice is raspy

1 for the treble, 2 for the bass
You know the style Tip, it's time to flip this
I like my beats hard like two day old shit
Steady eating booty MCs like cheese grits
My man Al B. Sure, he's in effect mode
Used to have a crush on Dawn from En Vogue
It's not like honey dip would wanna get with me
But just in case I own more condoms than T.L.C
Now the formula is this: me, Tip, and Ali
For those who can't count it goes 1-2-3
The anti batty boy, big up is who I be
Brothers find this hard to do but never me
Some brothers try to diss but Malik, you see 'em bitching
Me no care about them dibby MC, my shit is hitting
Trini gladiator, anti-hesitater
Shaheed push the fader from here to Grenada
Mr Energetic, who me sound pathetic?
When's the last time you heard a funky diabetic?
(I don't know man, I don't know man, I don't know man)
(I don't know, I don't know)

Oh my God, yes, oh my God
Oh my God, yes, oh my God
Oh my God, yes, oh my God
Oh my God, yes, oh my God

Complementary are we, the three for poetry
I got a humdinger coming hook line and sinker
The Timbo hoofs with the prints on the ground
Timbos on the toes, I like the way it's going down
Down like a lady of the evening
When it goes in Toots just believe it's in
Cause Queens is the county, Jamaica is the place
Take off your cleats cause you can't run the race

Oh my God, yes, oh my God
Oh my God, yes, oh my God
Oh my God, yes, oh my God
Oh my God, yes, oh my God
Oh my God, yes, oh my God

I be hating sucka MCs, and the sucka niggas
Posing like they hard when we know they damn card
What you figure, rhyme-wise I do the figure eight so concisely
Musically we are the herb so sit back and light me
Inhale...
My style is kinda fat reminiscent of a whale
Young girls desires older female dreams
I be the 
Abstract Poetic representing from Queens
Socially I'm not inane, black and white got game
If you came to the jam, well I'm glad you came
See, nigga first was used back in the Deep South
Falling out between the dome of the white man's mouth
It means that we will never grow, you know the word dummy
Upper niggas in the community think it's crummy
But I don't, neither does the youth cause we em-
Brace adversity it goes right with the race
And being that we use it as a term of endearment
Niggas start to bug, to the dome is where the fear went
Now the little shorties say it all of the time
And a whole bunch of niggas throw the word in they rhyme
Yo I start to flinch, as I try not to say it
But my lips is like the oowop as I start to spray it
My lips is like a oowop as I start to spray it
My lips is like a oowop as I start to spray the

I throw the sucka in the front for the ones that front
Sucka nigga, nigga nigga

I be hatin' sucka MC's, and the sucka niggas
Posin' like they hard when we know they damn card
What you figure, rhyme-wise, I do the figure eight
So concisely, musically we are the herb so sit back
And light me *inhalation noise* inhale *echoes*
My style is kinda fat reminescent of a whale
Young girls' desires for the females' dreams

Honey tell your man to chill, or else you'll be a widow
Did not you know that my styles are top-dollar?
The Five-Foot Assassin knocking fleas off his collar

We work for the paper so there'll never be a freebie
Lyrics are abundant cause we got it by the mass
Egos are all idle cause the music is the task

The Dawg is scientific with the styles I invent
A Tribe Called Quest represent, represent-sent
MCs like to meddle, but here's my proposition
I let my lyrics flow, and juxt your whole position
I'm radical with this like the man this song is after
Yo Tip settle down, what's the reason for the laughter?
I really can't say, I guess I laugh to keep from crying
So much going on, people killing, people dying
But I won't dwell on that, I think I'll elevate my mental
Thanks for these bars on the Biko instrumental
Yo I'll take it back, I'm the Indian giver
MCs take notes as I stand and deliver
Percussion isn't less, Ds wear the vest
Why they dodging bullets, you should be dodging Quest
Don't get me wrong, violence is not our forte
I just like to rhyme, kick the lyric skills like Pelé
Tip educate 'em, my rhymes are strictly taboo
Fill 'em with some fantasies and I'll look out like Tattoo

Ok, I am recognizing that the voice inside my head
Is urging me to be myself but never follow someone else
Because opinions are like voices, we all have a different kind
So just clean out all of your ears,
 these are my views and you will find
That we revolutionize over the kick and the snare
The ghetto vocalist is on a state-wide tear
Soon to be the continent and then the freaking globe
There's room for it all as we mingle at the mall
We welcome competition cause it doesn't make one lazy or worn
We gotta work hard, you know the damn card
Try to be the phattest is the level that we strive
Try to be the phattest also to stay alive",https://genius.com/A-tribe-called-quest-steve-biko-stir-it-up-lyrics
8 Million Stories,Midnight Marauders,1993,"Went to Carvel to get a milkshake
This honey ripped me off for all my loot cakes
The car oh yeah there's money in my jacket
Somebody broke into my ride and cold macked it
Yo Tip I tell you man the devil's tryin' it
But I'm goin' to stay strong cause I ain't buyin' it
Tonight I'm taking Sherry out, I don't have jack to wear
You know I gots to look dipped in the fresh new gear
Cool I found something so I ironed it
I then got caught up on the phone, oh shit, I'm frying it
Will someone tell me what did I do to deserve this?
I think I'll, pull out my suit for Sunday service
My little brother wants Barney, cool, I'm gettin' it
Took him down to Kay-Bee, they ain't sellin' it
Here we go with the crying, yo he's throwing fits
My blood pressure's blowing up, I can't take the shit
Finally got what he wanted, now he's good to go
Again the ride was smashed, where's my radio?
One time, the car was in the shop I had to borrow see...
They had no mercy on the car, Lyor will kill me
Where the hell can Nicki be? I'm gonna smack her up
I got the tickets for the Knicks and she cold stood me up
I need to hit a honey off, Jarobi pass the phone
Pulled out my book of hoes, oh yo, Sheila's home
Steady smiling like a mother yo I'm read' to bone
Went down on hon, she's in the red zone
Stressed out more than anyone could ever be
Forever tryin' to clear the samples for my new LP
Everybody knows I go to Georgia often
Got on the flight and I ended up in Boston
With all these trials and tribulations, yo, I've been affected
And to top it off, Starks got ejected

Problems, problems, problems
Woe is me I'm having problems, problems, problems

Just last week my girl was stressin' me
Now her best friend be undressing me
Well I was loving her by the moon ray
Now I'm tricking on her like Kinte' (c'mon)
Bought a bag of izm from the smoke shop
Walking towards the car, here come the damn cops
Now I'm station bound for the Thai sticks
I bought it for my man, I don't believe this shit
Coach sat me down from the ball team
Cause I was breaking niggas on the inseams
Some niggas 'cross town was trying to stick me
All I had was shorts, a dollar fifty
Picked up this girl in the hooptie
Just because I rhyme she tried to soup me
Pay for this, pay for that, loot for nails and hair
Who the hell you think I am, Mr. Belvedere?
Go and get a bloody job, then can we locute
Even if you give me boots, you'll never see my loot
She wasn't even all of that, just another hooker
So I turned that ass away, quick like Chuckii Booker
Sometimes you gotta put the hoes in their friggin' place
Just move from in front me with your batty face!

Problems, problems, problems
Lord knows I'm havin' problems, problems, problems
Jesus Christ I'm havin' problems, problems, problems
Pray for me I'm havin' problems, problems, problems
Yeah
Yeah
Just lay down your burdens by the riverside
Hah, and you'll be alright, know what I'm sayin'?

Midnight,Midnight Marauders,1993,"The night is on my mind
The sun'll still shine
But the night is on my mind
So parlay while I drop this rhyme

See, Jake be gettin illy when the sun get dark
He be coming out for heads but shit don't let me start
There's activities a-plenty in the nighttime
For the ghetto child it seem to be the right time
See, kids be getting stuck with jewels and fly gimmicks
Shorty see the action and then start to mimic
Running to the corner, the dice game is blazing
Looking at the loot, it seems so amazing
Puts the short down, to be exact one pound
He shakes the stones in his hand, then he lets it down
Scared money don't make none
He threw a trip on the ace now he's out son
Hits the local bodega to wolf down a hero
Son is on a midnight run like De Niro
Spots a shorty rock standing on his block
The fiends be hounding him to pump, so he adds to his knot
Conversation that he kicked to the shorty was a sly one
Increased intensity, cause damn she was a fly one
Took her to the crib there she ran her jibs
About mind upliftment and being positive
He yawned and he sighed til 1:05
Then he finally realized that honey wasn't live
At least he didn't plan on building for the evening
Threw the Fila on the dome and said 'Come on yo, we leaving'
Came out on the scene as he told her to beep him
Saw his man Stan with the blunt in his hand
(Ah sh...) You know the transaction
Brothers gettin lost in the weed satisfaction
Coming down the block man loud as (fuck)
You would swear Redman was inside the truck
As the night seemed darker, cops is on a hunt
They interrupt your cipher, and crush your blunt
See you left your work at home so they pat you down for nothing
Why in the hell does 10-4 keep fronting
You push to the park even though it's still dark
The kid is nice on the hoop, he said 'I'll spot you troop'

The night is on my mind
The sun’ll still shine
But now the night is on the mind
The night is on the mind
The night is on yo mind
Ayo, the sun’ll still shine
But now the night is on the mind

As for me I'm a nocturnal animal, God concentrates
On a young black man who makes the niggas speakers shake
The nighttime is busy, it's word to Aunt Kizzy
It's the time we get down, yo son, you know the sound
The flavas on the top with the rugged beat to back it
The night makes the aura and the Jake can't hack it
The way the moon dangles in the midnight sky
And the stars dance around, a-yo I think it's fly
Intensity, most rappers don't see it
Spirit wise, musically, you gotta be it
Serenity and silence of the sounds and emotions
In the concrete jungle when the sun don't bungle
I think it's hard to find the words on how I feel
I paid about a deuce twenty for the Ampex steel
But let me slow down, I think I ran my jibs enough
Peace out to the Nation, stay rugged and rough

The night is on my mind
The sun’ll still shine
The night is on my mind
The night is on my mind
The night is on my mind
Yeah, the sun’ll still shine
But now the night is on my mind
Uh-huh, the night is on my mind
The night is on yo mind
You know the sun’ll still shine
But now the night is on the mind
Yeah, the night is on the mind
The night is on the mind
Ayo, the sun’ll still shine
But now the night is on the mind
Yeah, the night is on the mind
The night is on the mind
Ayo, the sun’ll still shine

I'm not your average MC with the Joe Schmoe flow
If you don't know me by now, you'll never know
Stepping on my critics, beating on my foes
The plan is to stay focused, only then I can grow
Straight from the heart, I represent hip hop
I be three albums deep, but I don't wanna go pop
Too many candy rappers seem to be at the top
Too much candy is no good, so now I'm closing the shop
Crushing competition like Italians on grapes
My rhymes styles be blending like a Ron G tape
My man where ya going, you can't escape
When the Tribe is in the house that means nobody is safe
How can a reverend preach, when a rev can't define
The music of our youth from 1979
We rap by what we see, meaning reality
From people busting caps and like Mandela being free
Not every MC be with the negativity
We have a slew of rappers pushing positivity
Hip hop will never die yo, it's all about the rap
So Mayor Barry smoking crack, let's preach about that
The trash you talk won't matter, that old bogus chatter
The more that you condemn us, it only makes us phatter
When I talk, I know I'm talking for Hip Hoppers all around
You know you love the sound, we gets down

Styles that we present are just a few
To do away with you and your hum drum crew
This is '93 and the shit is real
Black people unite and put down your steel
Ladies make a forum on your sexual drive
Devote it to your lover and make it thrive
The rhythm's in F, I'm a hip hop body
Release my energy with the force of a shotty
Standing on the wall with my Polo on
Talking to the girl with the Liz Claiborne
Keep the poetry in my black knapsack
Got my Timbo hooves and my Doublemint pack
Hit the city streets to enhance my soul
I can kick a rhyme over ill drum rolls
With a kick, snare, kicks and high hat
Skilled in the trade of that old boom bap
I can do a trick with the opposite breed
I used to down 40s and smoke grade weed
Now, I'm doing shows with half loot down
Now it's time for me to take ya uptown

Keep It Rollin’,Midnight Marauders,1993,"A-yo swing swing swing, to chop chop chop
Yo that's the sound when MC's get mopped
Don't come around town without the hip in your hop
Cause when the shit hits the fan, that ass'll get dropped
MC's wanna attack me but them punks can't cope
I'll have you left without a job, like Isaac from The Love Boat
So money watch your mouth, or I'mma have to bust ya
Battling MC's, from JFK to Russia
Back down to London, Sweden and Brazil
Do a U.S. tour for three months and then I chill
Styles be fat like Jackie Gleason, the rest be Art Carney
People love the Dawg like the kids love Barney
""I love you, you love me""
The shorty Phife Dawg is your favorite MC
So move back yaself dread, you know the element
The Tribe is good for your health like a can of Nutrament
MC's don't have no wins, MC's don't have no (bitches)
I flip shit crazier than a busload full of Jerry's Kids
Your crew don't want it and your crew don't want it
But if you feel you can swing it, then money please bring it
Large Professor in the house, you know how we do
I skate on your crew, like Mario Lemieux
Peace to Ike Love and the rest of the crew
I'll meet you guys in front the cleaners, bring the blunts and the brew so...

Whassup kids? The Ab is speaking from the moon
Thanks for your support, a-yo I'll be home soon
But the only thing I ask when I return from my task
Is a whole bunch of beats and a flask full of ass
My fist stands firm because I'm, black and solid
I open up your pores like a plate full of collards
C'mon take it easy wouldya, easy easy
I'm up in the gulley, that's when I am her Buddy
She told me pull her hair, I did, it drove her nutty
Filled up the hole like spackle or I mean putty
When we over joints like this we never cruddy
Extra P hooked the beat, and kid that feels luh-ove-ly
Check it out, cause my conception is immaculate
A bachelor, looking for a bachlelorette
Back to you MC's, this is what you're gonna get
A first degree burn from my man Ken's cigarette
I hope you like Malboro
Paul,
 you know we thorough like Denver
The beat feels like a never-ender
But all things good must, so I won't sweat it
Drop the seeds for the youthful crew, I hope you get it
As I stand, grip this mic inside my hand
Boy I smack you up, like I was your old grand
So respect yourself Son, and come and gimme love
Once again the Ab is who you think of
So chill with the beef money, we gotta dead it

It's Extra P and yo Tip I'm bout to set it
On the country once again here to win
I'm Uptown chilling, 
taking in this Grandmaster Vic blend
From the projects, the PJ's, 
fuck them two DJs
Self mission
, I had her in the ill position saying
""Large you's the soul brother that I'd like to eff with for the rest of my life""
Yeah yeah now check the method
As I, proceed with what you need like Akinyele
A whip looks complete when the tires say Pirelli
Funk monkey, one rapper fell off, now he's a junkie
There's 8 million stories in the city it's a pity
Don't fuck with the skins if she's trying to act shitty
Big shout to the Guru, Primo
 
and Zulu
Nation,
 was on a vacation, in the ghetto
Yo Ras slow your roll I'm bout to bag this schmeydl
Rapper Nas on top it seems we gonna rock it
Queens represent,
 
buy the album when I drop it",https://genius.com/A-tribe-called-quest-keep-it-rollin-lyrics
Clap Your Hands,Midnight Marauders,1993,"(*scratching* - ""Clap your hands now"")

Brothers know the flavs when the Quest gets loose
Slamming sucker fuckers like the wrestler Zeus
Crazier than 2Pac in the flick called Juice
Cock is longer than the hat worn by Dr. Seuss
Love a girl in Daisy Dukes like them kids called Duice
Gets paid to sex the hoochie like my main man Luke
Control the mic like Denzel on the girls
Wack MCs be on the nuts like
 
Rocket J. Squirrel
The worst thing in the world is a 
sucker MC
Favorite rap group in the world is EPMD
Can't forget the 
De La
, 
due to originality
And if I ever went solo my favorite MC would be me
Phife Dawg up in the house, I give a shout out to Snoopy
Peace to all the Questers, to hell with the groupies
Like um, 
Ralph Malph to Potsie
, 
Brooklyn to Dodger
Laverne to Shirley
, 
Rerun to Roger
Ren to the Stimpy
, 
Laurel to Hardy
Q-Tip and Phife
, they mash up the party
Kick the rhymes and more rhymes
Kick the beats and more beats
We'll have you scratching in your head like Shaheed on Technics
For those who wanna oppose then take a stand
But for now, just shut your shit and clap your hands


You just wanna dance man, then clap your hands
If you venture up the wrong road, then the circumstance
Will be crucial
, I got hundreds of rhymes that'll suit you
So listen
The Abstract
 
intuition is very very worthy
I can feel ya out from Russia to Jersey
Can't understand the underground, it gets deep
The Lo, the Nikes, the links, the jeeps
The women, the lingo, and all the other goods
Peace to the hoods, keep my shit on play
Please don't do the mute when you hear me on the juke
Brothers know the angle, it's the Star-Spangled black banner
Hook up the beats at the funk manor
If you want a roll, then the dough I be raking
The scope is on the world 'cause it's mine for the taking
You know I'm gonna do it
My shit is rock solid, but it flows like fluid
Chemists get confused of my ill composition
This is the third of the new Tribe addition
MCs be swinging, but a lot of them be missing
So shut your bloodclot and listen
Cuz I'm bringin you the ill rendition
I'd like to send this out to the 
L.E.S
Gotta a lot of rhythm and style and finesse
Come here love, hot sex on a plat
And when you're done with that then clap
 - repeat until end

Keep bouncing",https://genius.com/A-tribe-called-quest-clap-your-hands-lyrics
Lyrics to Go,Midnight Marauders,1993,"Lyrics to go (lyrics to go) uhh
Lyrics to go (lyrics to go) ahh yeah, c'mon
Lyrics to go (lyrics to go)
Lyrics to go (lyrics to go) yeah yeah
Lyrics to go (lyrics to go)

Goin on and on to the rhythmic variation
Wakin in the morning I still represent the nation
When I speak of nation please don't make the deviation
Rebels of the party who create the drum sensation
Mind is a pit of different information
Microphone is on so of course communication
Bogle at the party then you got the bogle-ation
Decaptatin' foes, yo, as if my name was Jason (c'mon)
Makin all the fellas at the party lose composure
Hook up the beat with the mic and it's over (original, uh!)
A Tribe Called Quest we on the run for whatever
Trials and tribulations that we have to endeavor
Brothers know my steelo it's a letter to the better
If you see a shorty that you like, then you sweat her
Silly with the microphone, in other words I'm loco
Six foot zero with my height, complexion cocoa
Representin on the mic it seems to be my daily
I can do a split and turn around like Alvin Ailey
But when it comes to days like this I got lyrics to go

(I got lyrics to go) It's like that y'all, c'mon y'all
Lyrics to go It's like that y'all, c'mon y'all
(Lyrics to go) It's like that

I know it's been two years but see the Tribe was never fallin
Would have tried for singin but that stuff was not my callin
The mic is in effect so you know I'm never stallin
Walkin through the door and all them suckers started haulin
Talk a lot of trash but no one can seem to beat it
Pull out your microphone and watch the Phifer make you eat it
The MC's they get jealy when the girly's on my belly
Kick a slow dance like my brother R. Kelly (bust a rhyme)
Today's a hip-hop draft will I be top-seeded? (uhh)
Worked too frickin hard while all the rest were gettin weeded
Steady kickin styles so I can reach that other level (uh)
Don't worry about gettin gassed I push the pedal to the metal
Always wanted this cause it surely beats a scramble (right)
I'm Jordan with the mic, huh, wanna gamble? (mmm)
This I dedicate to all the honeys that be bogle-in
Cause at the end of the night y'know Malik will have his Trojans
But when it comes to nights like this I got lyrics to go
Check it out y'all
(Lyrics to go) It's like that y'all
Lyrics to go Check it out y'all

Check it out y'all
It's like that y'all
Check it out y'all
It's like that y'all
Check it out here we go!

Please proceed with caution cause the lyricist is fatal
I can kick your little monkey ass like Kato (yes dread, uhh)
Formulate your rhymes like a child forms Play-Doh (right)
Calm and serene like the study was Tao
Poetry machine with correct mechanisms
Immune to disease I defeat organisms
That are waitin in my path, I overstep the critters
Give your ass the willies and your moms'll get the jitters
Quitters turn to losers, losers are forgotten
Tangling my cord with hopes that I’ll stop rockin
Never will that happen only if it is permitted (uhh)
Wait... I think somebody shitted (c'mon)
I guess that will be me cause I'm the only one MCin
I go for what I know doin a show for human beings
Always try to lead yo never will I follow
Blowin up the spot like Fred did to Rollo
And when it comes to days like this, I got lyrics to go
Check it out y'all
(Lyrics to go) It's like that y'all
I got lyrics to go Everybody
(I got lyrics to go) Ah c'mon now
I got lyrics to go Ah check it out y'all

One Two Shit,The Love Movement,1994,"One two, one two
One-wa-wa-one, one two one two (Repeat x3)
Yo it's the Q-Tip, you know I get down
Yes I rock to the rhythm of a funky sound, it go
One-wa-wa-one, one two one two (Repeat x2)

And it's the, Phife Dawg, and I do the same
And when it comes to ripping mics a-yo it ain't no games
One-wa-wa-one, one two one two (Repeat x2)

A-yo you know it's Busta Rhymes, every time
Oh yes, I'm coming wicked with a new design, I'm saying
One-wa-wa-one, one two one two (Repeat x2)

Emcees ain't coming equipped with the rhymes
Don't do the crime if you can't do the time
The time is eternal when you play with the miser
Soul is in my body and the health make me wiser
The tantalizing wordplay, yeah that's the joint
Sometimes I have to cuss just to prove my damn point
Brothers need to come with better compositions
I write and recite to make good position
In this rap game here we engineer
Stabbing up the jam, yeah son, shit's clear
And I be kicking rhymes in my own damn way
Beating niggas to the punch like Sugar Ray
Got the cool-ass style that's cooler than the cool
My lyrics is the bullet and the mic is the tool
Peace to C-73 and C-74
Do a little something when I'm out on tour
Coming through like narcotics for the antibiotics
Flap a shorty's pockets to the 
space like Sprockets
What you really need to do is just boogie your ass
It's not gas, we got to make the good times last
Let the good times roll cause we in control
Take you out on your hide less you paying a toll
Let the good times roll, let the good times roll
Take you out on your hide less you paying the toll

Question, why is that emcees be wack
And major labels wanna sign all that crap, a-yo funk that!
Word to life I'm coming rugged
Cause once you add the hip to the hop kid, it equals out to love
If the beat's fat I use it, some wack shit, I lose it
Refuse it, how could you chose it, it stinks remove it
Put down the mic kid, cause you gets no dap
How long did it take for you to see you can't rap
The name is Phife Dawg and I got nuff styles
It doesn't take long for me to get buckwild
So bust what I'm swinging what I'm swinging when I swing
I rap when I rap cause I never wanna sing
Go ask the last emcee what happened when he said battle
I bust his ass in Cleveland now he's 
sleepless in Seattle
Rude bwoy official coming with the ill grammar
Coming back on kids like Joey Montana
We be the three emcees that make your mind go batty
Mad play on WKRP in Cincinatti
So lord send a hand and if you can't send a hand, send a man
And if you can't send a man, come yourself
Cause all these biting emcees, lord them something else
See I kick the styles that'll make your ass melt
Money on my mind so never mind a trick
New York is the town and the team is the Knicks
World's greatest five footer ripping parties apart
Here comes Shaheed with the big green shark
Never had to rhyme about filling one with lead
Never mind that, man, here come the dread!

We coming far far far
Busta Rhymes is coming far far far, you know you hear me, star
Bet your bottom dollar
Right after this jam about one million one two niggas gon' follow
Whether it be today or tomorrow
Niggas become aggravating, sickening, you beat them like they father
Oh shit check out what I'm saying
A-ha a-ha oh a-ha a-ha you know my niggas don't be playing
Once upon a motherfucking time
I received the opportunities to represent my first rhymes
To define, lyrical sensations
Black masons blowing up the spot just to represent the Nations
Three dimensions, tryclops, Mr. Busta Rhymes three eyes
Fat like a burger and fries
Mama-so mama-sa mama makossa
Go back to the country to go check my grandmama
Eeeyah! Bring it to the table at the meetings
Gathering large receivings, delivering intellectual ass beatings
As I carry on with my proceedings
Greetings! Watch a nigga debut on premier movie screenings
But before I be face to face with my eternal resting place
I hope you find civilized every soul and every race
Sit dog sit! Busta Rhymes forever on that ultrasonic shit",https://genius.com/A-tribe-called-quest-one-two-shit-lyrics

To the North to the South to the East to the West
I don't discriminate boy I bring it to your chest
If you oppose, then your soul will decompose
Strive to get money and I'm not no hoe
Fresher than the air that you're breathing through your nose
Iller than the kicks that you're puttin on your toes
You can ask Bo but yo that nigga don't know
About the dominant factor, the accurate rapper
Here's the next chapter, page ninety-five
Niggas so hard it's a wonder they alive
But yo we still survive through the danger that lurks
My eyes remain wide while you ass like Urk
And yo my Family Matters
, so all you mad hatters
Put your thinking caps on and motherfuckin brainstorm
'Cause I got the plan that wins and can't lose
Your man knows who's nice, say Tip, he'll say ""True""
A lot of these jokers out here is blasé
I'll be rockin mikes until a horse says 'hey'
Some are preoccupied with glamour and glitz
Actin all bougie and making big movies
But I'll be in the cut, call me Incognito
Busy making joints that will bump for my people
You're listening to a man who was something from nothing
Stay in me forever head, never be frontin'

Once in a while we have fun in the mix
Into good living but some be into glitz
Everybody knew, all the fellas and the chicks
We gotta wear a shoe that fits

Peace to my girl named Dawn Paris
Peace to the Organized Kon-fus-ion
Peace to all my shorties who be dying too young
Peace to both coasts and the land in between
Peace to your man if you're doing your thing
Peace to my peoples who is incarcerated
Asalaam alaikum means peace, don't debate it
Devouring, and towering over fools
Your mic is broke and my shit's cool
The black man with the understanding of
The three wise men and the theories of Zen
Yo, I get inside the crevice like a dentist
Disrupt, the block, like Dennis, the Menace
Shaheed is on the needle, the shit it won't weeble
Or wobble, your rhymes is mixed up like Boggle
Bingo! That was the damn dog's name
But yo I know another one with much more fame
The Phife Dawg, and that's my word to the cipher
About to bring it to your chest and 'cause strife, check it out
You're doubling back to your rhyming pad
What I represent is MC's gone mad
In a perfect world there's imperfect acts
We've come like a guide to redirect alla that
So people with a gift can just flaunt and get money
So much, we in the bank that the shit ain't funny
Money is invested in real estate and stocks
But not inside the glamour 'cause all of that stops

Yo, this the Cons to the Quence
Up in ya like a stiff one, nah'mean?
It's nine-five, you got to live it or rip it

Ohhhh, you did it to me once again my friend
I swear you do it to me everytime
Cause you stay crazy on my mind
Yo you got it goin on (say word), on and on and on
On and on and on

This is the year that I come in and just devastate
My style is great ask your peoples can I dominate?
My rhymes are harder than last night's erection
Don't play me close, I'll have this mic up in your mid-section
My shit is lovely simply meaning that my joint is tight
Amping up the mic making sure production's tight
Sometimes I might catch a severe case of writer's block
But by the end of the day you'll be on my jock
My name's Malik my hobby's putting MC's to the test
And if you front I'll put my foot up in your freaking chest
Freestyle fanatic, and never will it ever stop
You crew is loose, you might just want to call the cops

Aye, yo I gotta put some action on paper
Make sure my verse jump up and spread out like the raper
The only tip I got for a waiter
Is watch the doorknob hit me where the dirty dog shoulda' bit me
That was my train of thought, but for so long I fought
Now I'm at a level supreme to the devil
So turn up the bass and lay low on the treble
We be the real MC's and you dead, bring a shovel
Revitalize, the vital Tribe nigga, WHAT?
The ladies sweat the style like the squirrel sweat the nuts
You know a fellas good for the moola
Don't smoke no woolas, read the name call me Slick Tip the Ruler

Ohhhh, you did it to me once again my friend
I swear you do it to me everytime
Cause you stay crazy on my mind
Yo you got it goin on (say word), on and on and on
On and on and on

Yo I've been treading on this globe man for twenty-five joints
Sometimes Shaitan got me by the pressure points
But I can break a fella down like sex
You eat Wheat Chex but still light in the ass and can't flex
If one nigga front I'mma make more pay
Cause tonight, we gettin off like O.J
And yo I got a Dawg that bites, fuck the barking
Yo I got a crew with the beats and the smarts and

I fought my shit up on Linden in the one-nine-two
Forever writing never biting ain't shit else to do
Hoping to battle, but most MC's ain't ready yet
But if they utter one word then it's as good as set
You have MC's dropping bombs that's incredible
Some of the brothers, their styles are just despicable
As for me see I just do how I love to do
Try to deny me of my props then I'll be seeing you
Most of you suckers wanna be down for the tag along
The freaking fame, someone tell em that this shit ain't games
You gots to do this from your heart meaning your inner soul
And if it's real only then will you be on a roll
I try to stay on top my game there ain't no time to lose
Four albums deep as a Quester but still we payin' dues
So hear me out one time, you got to be yourself
Cause if you ain't yourself you end up by your freaking self
I'm coming rugged with the Linden Boule type of slang
And yo, we'll see who can hang yo

When you're face to face with your adversity
I really know how it feels to be, stressed out, stressed out
We're gonna make this thing work out eventually

Yo I ain't one to complain but there's things in the game
(What's your name?)
Consequence, I'm tight, burnt like flames
(And why's that?)
American dreams, they got this ghetto kid in a fiend
(Don't stress that cause it's not in your bloodstream)
(Your whole being, comes from greatness, d'you remember)
(Shaytan got you caught in the storms of December)
(And brothers on the block packing nines like September)
(Crazy situations keeps pockets on slender)
Yo I be on the avenue where they be actin brand new
I'm splurging on these Reebok joints for shorty boo
All of a sudden, I saw these two kids frontin'
Talking out they joints but they wasn't saying nuttin'
My hand was on my toolie they was actin unruly
(Say word) Yo word up, yo I was tight caught up
But I swallowed my pride and let that nonsense ride
Because I'm positive it seems that negative dies
Yo we was at the dice game making these cats look silly
Flamming, steady running off at the Willie
I had my cash mixed, my rent due, with my play-dough
I gotta see some loot so on my girls I blow
Shook them shits in my palm let em hit the flo'
Kept my eyeballs scoping for them pigs po-po
I got to go on the ave see my parole by fo'
But I gotta steady freak these boys like JoJo
And I was doing it, 'til I met Ike, Spike, and Mike
One roll, they had my pockets thirstier than Sprite
Yo I know the feeling, when you feeling like a villain
You be having good thoughts but the evils be revealin'
And the stresses of life can take you off the right path (no doubt)
Jealousy and envy tends to infiltrate your staff
We gotta hold it down so we can move on past
All adversities, so we can get through fast, like that

I really know how it feels to be, stressed out, stressed out
When you're face to face with your adversity
I really know how it feels to be, stressed out, stressed out
We're gonna make this thing work out eventually

You got the N.W.O. (low cash flow)
Your baby's on the way (and you don't know who)
And crosstown niggas trying to (bust at you)
Aiyyo they got me stressed out (and you don't know what to do)
So frame this Kodak black, and vision to my contact
With a poultry scrap, workers get pistol smacked
The switch-hitting Queens, niggas liquid sword spittin
With raw poppy, and now your first love is krill
Your vision of the mil got crept like Hey Lover
Tried to rise to the top, you just couldn't recover
And all I want is my laceration of the pie
To get this whipped cream before the water runs dry
Niggas flash dancing, yo, I don't know why
You're sick of snitching, she got you cruising to the pokey
Like Smokey, the stress be trying to squeeze out a homey
While I'll be trying to get star status like Shinobi
So we can build a dynasty, just like the Toby's
And all I want is the world to know my steez
These money hungry niggas is seven thirty
And got me stressed out like these frog emcees

I really know how it feels to be, stressed out, stressed out
When you're face to face with your adversity
I really know how it feels to be, stressed out, stressed out

I'm sure it will, especially if it's God's will
MC's be ready to die cause I'ma kill
All your negative feelings standing on two feet
While I make the hotties move to the hip-hop beat
You know it's realer killer, realer than you can imagine
Using every source of pain in my range to make it happen
If I make it happen, that means I'm making motion
And I'm doing my thing causing an ill commotion
Everybody do the hop, make it smooth like lotion
I lay up in the piece on a incognotion

You gotta do the hop, you move to the beat, you don't stop
Now everybody here, you do the hop
You going up to cop, Uptown for a brick, don't stop
You gotta come back and do the hop
Yo, fuck the cops, you gotta come back and do the hop
Move till your body won't stop
You gotta do the hop, non-stop motion, non-stop
You gotta come back and do the, do the...

You see you, your career is done like Johnny Carson's
Get me vexed, I do like Left Eye, start an arson
Now that I got that out my system
Watch me stab up the track as if my name was OJ Simpson
I packs it in like Van Halen
I work for mine, you, you're freeloading like Kato Kaelin
I'm representing with my crew
Mess around, bite my rhymes, I'll beat that ass with my shoe
C'mon, you know I'm crazy nice
Brothers can't deal with the shorty named Phife
You must be mad in the head
I bust his ass and leave 'im blood clot for dead
Niggas sound like Das EFX
If it ain't Das EFX then they sounding like Meth
You might as well do Megadeth
Y'all punk MCs better save your freaking breath
You's a corny motherfucker
You must be high smoking dust with Chris Tucker
Y'all faggot asses don't want this
I pull more peeps than the peeps at the premier of Pocohantas
Word is bond I am the baddest
And all you honeys out there, word is bond, you know my status
So come and pull your panties down
This ain't the Barnum Bailey show, I don't get down with the clowns
So why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends
But don't bring your ass by and you ain't got no ends
Word is bond it don't stop
Just ease your mind, come along and do the hop

You gotta do the hop, you move to the beat, you don't stop
Come on everybody, do the hop
Even if you cop, you gotta come back and do the hop
You move to the beat, you don't stop
You smoking jump rocks, you gotta just stop and do the hop
Then you come back and do the hop
You know we don't stop, we on the ghetto prize on the top
You know we come back and do the hop
Shorties in the place, all the shorty rocks, do the hop
You gotta come back and do the hop
We never go on pop, you know we come back, we do the hop
This is how it is, we do the hop
You move to the beat, then come on everybody, don't...",https://genius.com/A-tribe-called-quest-the-hop-lyrics

Phony rappers who do not excite
Phony rappers, check it out, aight

Yo, I was riding the train
And this Puerto Rican kid said simple and plain: ""Let's battle""
It kinda took me by surprise 'cause the brother was moving
Wit' his eyes on the prize, I said 'Screw it'
I ain't got nuttin to lose, but um
But I got to do this shit real quick, so um
Hurry up kid, bust your joints and then I'll bust mine
And I'll be out 'cause I got to see this hottie,' he said 'OK'
'Now check it, check it out, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah'
That's what he said
Then I came back and just fucked up his head
'Cause yo, he thought an MC who was seen on TV
Couldn't hold the shit down in New York City
Ayo, I showed his ass, then I went off on my task
To bless her ass Uptown, real MC's will hold it down
Yeah, yeah, sonny, to the beat like that
You wanna bring it to me, where you at?

Yes, dread, I had a similar situation
When this kid tried to tell me I didn't deserve my occupation
He said I wasn't shit that I was soon to fall
I looked him up and down, grab my crotch and said balls
Of course he tried to bring it on the battling tip
And you know me, you know I had to come out my shit
Trying to lounge at the mall, me, Skeff and Mr. Walt
And finally I banged his ass wit the verbal assault
He said a rhyme about his .45 and his nickel bags of weed
That's when I proceeded to give him what he needed
Talking 'bout I need a Phillie right before I get loose
Poor excuse, money please, I get loose off of orange juice
Preferably Minute Maid 'cause that's exactly what it takes to write a rhyme, huh
So screw your nickels and your dimes
Because an MC like me be on TV
Don't mean I can't hold my shit down in NYC
Phony rappers who do not write
Phony rappers who do not excite
Phony rappers, you know they type
Phony rappers, check it

It seems there's a sanitation, y'all full of trash talker
Sounding good, but money, can you be the dog walker?
Talking 'bout your mic days and your breakdancing
Not enhancing, you sound tired...
Oh, shit, I didn't know you like to play yourself in front'cha friends
Sitting there, lying to no end
MC's for me make things happening
Talk about a world but in a form of rapping
Who will be the captain of this ship
If it goes down, don't you know you have to go wit it
Just because you rhyme for a couple of weeks
Doesn't mean that you've reach the MC's peak
Let me stop sounding all bitter
Ghetto child, never be a quitter
But don't be a phony in the litter
Take it as a letter from the better
Take it from a man who used to rhyme in busted ass Jettas

Yo, Phife, you need a condom
Word to God
Mess around, I catch AIDS from MC's being on my nuts too hard
'Cause on my boulevard, you better bring your bodyguard
And what's your boulevard?
L.B., I represent naturally
So don't step on the boulie if you know that you're phony
Or else I'll bend that ass like elbow macaroni
'Cause I gotta keep it real (gotta keep it real) Yep!
A Tribe Called Quest, you see we never half step
(So on your mark) Get ready, MC's be jetty
Me and Phife be hangin' like Veronica and Betty
Archie, Jughead, snuffing MC's
From Brainslane down to Hempstead
Yes 'Quence, see over
His rhyme style is older that a Chrysler Cordoba
I'm wilder then the cats from Arizona
Villanova, or, or, Kentucky
Who's the next MC stepping up to try and bust me
Bring him here and boy, will I ever let him have it
And when it comes to the microphone, don't even try to grab it
What?!?!

“This feeling of embarrassment
This shyness, this bashfulness…
If you take that out of the people then these people will do whatever they want to do

As I send the mic out the park like Reggie Jackson
You be the minor leaguer who sees no action
The coming attraction, what, the main feature
And I'mma greet ya, like a rhyming ass creature
Lurking all up in the dark, unknown parts
The brother well prepared is the brother who will start
And that's me Akh
I, as long as the ladies move they bodies
We'll have a forum to stand
Cause that happens to be the nature of man

Ain't no ifs, no buts, no ands, or maybes

I said, respect me for that and let me do my thing

Over the illest drum rolls

Yo, how you doing? Let me give you an intro
My name's the Abstract, now let me give you some info
Got the diamond in the back and the sunroof shit
That makes the hardcore MC's resort to being bitch
And I don't give a shit about being wild rich
Just make me comfortable and I'll deal with it
Your lust for the riches make a nigga feel sick
Down to his zealots, upchuck and then spit
Denouncing my beliefs, well then your wig get split
Lay your egos on the ground so that you'll benefit
You can take these words and relay it to your clique
Take some time for your mind and get off them head trips
Don't try to play me, see my name's not Dick
The Tribe is the crew that makes the mics get lit
Like the Fourth of July on some firework shit
My record company be on some true jerk shit
But that's aight, now, I'm on some true work shit
And I'mma make it happen for my whole outfit

You know we got to get control
Over the illest drum rolls

A-yo, we just getting started, got to redirect this vision
Got the beauty of a flower plus dimensions like a prism
Your minds are locked down like prison
Y'all really need to go lay down cause positivity has risen
We hitting, yo bust how we too strong to be broken
Occasional malfunction pressure time, we ain't joking
For security, yo we on this run like Logan
Kamaal's doing the hustle and you backstage vogueing
We all got faults, don't ever try to think that you perfect
We all are human beings, there's bullshit at the surface
Sometimes, I mean we rhyme, damn, we ain't prophets
And if you think so, you need to stop it
So jump back inside your shell
Let your million dollar thoughts propel but next man don't get jel
Playa hate that all carries weight that we don't need
We slim with disabilities and thick with possibilities
Cause then you can't move with agility
Navigating with good visibility
We put these tunes out in record shop facilities
And strive to get this constant money activity
We try to stay on the scene like Fidel
So if you get enraged with these names it still ring bells
There ain't no plan B's, yo watch, we moving through with plan A
Money market doing things the right way

It was Friday afternoon in the middle of June
Heineken bottle caps and the aroma of boom
Around the time everybody just got home from class
Shooting dice, talkin shit, hoping the cash would last
Yo, this was around the time when I didn't know no better
Juney moved around in a tinted out Jetta
Then he introduced me to that hydro smoke
And I took one toke, yo, I almost choked
See I never smoked before so my nerves got shot
Then he told me about the party at the spot Jamroc
It was guaranteed on but I said ""Son, chill""
There's a joint around the way that's supposed to be real
Word
He said we got all day, so we gonna do it right
Hit your man's joint first and Jamrock in one night
Then I said ""Aight"", then I hopped inside the jetty
Let me take a shower, I'm sweaty, and then I'll be ready
Tonight is the night I get my groove on steady
And get my drink on with that Ford named Betty
I went upstairs to get fly, smoke my Thai
Drunk some liquor, to meet my high quicker
Now, I'm type stimo, the party is the M.O
Me and my crew, we get it started like a demo
Eleven in the evening, I'm feelin like a heathen
This thing is going down and I highly doubt I'm leaving
Booty cheeks are in motion and the kids was drinking potion
Word is bond, 
that Black Moon joint got me open

Yo, the DJ flipped the script
Threw on the good shit that made the kid lose his grip
Blendin Risin to the Top and got these shorties hoppin

That's the sound of the man getting yanked off the stage
Trying to front like he mad paid
Sucking so bad, we threw his mama off the train (insane)
MCs are just givin' it all away (OK)
Who said him know about the Quest-like sound?
Mess around and get your ass knocked down (clown)
I dedicate this to the posers that play hard
You wanna hear some rhymes, well then bring your bodyguard
So he can peep the worldwide Willie that we display
Leaving all MCs in complete disarray
I beez a veteran MC, crushing crews for years
You frontin' hard when you softer than the Berenstain Bears
Yeah, chumps be like ""Phife, that ain't fair""
'Fuck outta here, do I look like I care?
Come off my stage before I grab ya neck and handle ya
Wet ya like punani, then dry you like Canada
Shaheed Muhammad's on the Gemini mixer
Peace to Derrick Coleman, Mad Max and the Sixers
I'm cappin' hard cuz I got this rap shit sold
From Linden Boulevard down to Cascade Road
You know my steez, I treat hip-hop like a sport
Holdin' down fort up on Martinique Court like...

(Where ya at?) We seein' life for what it is
(Where ya at?) We get this money for these kids
(Where ya at?) We bout to build the foundation
(Where ya at?) We gonna start the Zulu Nation
(Where ya at?) Come on, come on
(Where ya at?) We gonna put it all together
(Where ya at?) No matter what the hell the weather
(Where ya at?)

Uh, uh, mind power
Uh, uh, mind power

Maybe that'll ease ya
Master of this microphone mackin', master as in great
I'll have your brain goin' in circles as my style tends to ovulate
I'm makin' moves, never movies, that's why y'all MCs lose me
Retrace, won't, so you're stubborn like groupies
Kid, you know my flava, tear this whole jam apart
Fuck around and have your heart, like Jordan had Starks'
While you playin' hokey pokey, there's no time to be dokey
'Cause I come out to play every night like Charles Oakley
Dissin' around with wack rhymin'
You lose your grip from chalk climbin'
Let me take this time to say R.I.P. to Phyllis Hyman
Who never got the props that she damn well deserved
But see me, you don't wanna see me, 'cause all MCs are gettin' served
The nerve, for you to even step to the Phifer
I'll bumrush your set and crush your whole cipher
Reserve, a spot for me in hip hop's hall of fame
'Cause rappin' ain't no game, big up your head and maintain
Yeah, Queens forever in this piece crushin' any beef
Ain't nothin' sweet, the bakery's across the fuckin' street
Phife Dawg, swingin' it back and forth just like Aaliyah
Makin' moves on your heart like that trick Tamia
No doubt about it, I love hip hop to death
But yo Tip, bring in the chorus 'cause I'm losin' my breath

Ay yo, you know the deal when the diggy Dawg is on the scene
We got the fiend bumpin' straight from the borough Queens
You know the deal when the diggy Dawg is on the scene
We got the fiend bumpin' straight from the borough Queens
You know the deal when the diggy Dawg is on the scene
You know the deal, ha, you know the deal

Big up pop Duke, that's where I caught my athleticism
My mama, no doubt, that's where I got my lyricism
My nana, that's where I got my spiritualism
As for Tip and Shah, they made me stop from smokin' izm
Now, when I'm with some cheese, I'll be lettin' off gism
Writin' rhymes since Daddy Kane and Biz Mark was on Prism
I got a brave heart like the one named Shirley Chisholm
As for my late twin, boy, I wish I was with him
Got the Lightro in the back talkin' bout (come on, get him)
And when it comes to rhymes, no doubt, I flip em
Sucka MC in my path, hey man, I say we ship him
Money please, your rhymes are wack, say word, this geek is trippin'
Just because my name is Phife, my man, I'm never slippin'
I got the type of flave to have your ass straight bitchin'
For those who act cute, see I got them on mute
Have you walkin' through your projects in your birthday suit
'Cause your style is off loot, so I played him like a flute
If you a sucka MC, then it's you I rebuke
My style is, every day all day, similar to water
Crushin' MCs as if my name was Sargent Slaughter
Keep shit hotter...than a sauna
Or better yet, the hormones on your Christian daughter
Hey, I tried to warn her
My sounds the type to kill, like the grill on Lauryn Hill
So all ya sucka MCs, y'all best go chill
Bout to go to Union Square so I can see my care bear
Singin' good stuff in my ear, runnin' fingers through my hair
Represent the Zulu Nation with illy rap creations
Just keep shit hotter than Death Row-Bad Boy confrontations
Chillin' with Fudge Love because he represents the Haitians
Ya new mean

Word up
I just wanna big up everybody for supportin' A Tribe Called Quest

This be the fourth LP, you know what I'm sayin'?
Tip, Shaheed and Phife, Beats, Rhymes and Life

A Tribe Called Quest came to drop jewels wit' ease
Plus make you party, we do this music thing for everybody
Black, White, Latino and Asian, we cold raisin'
The stakes of hip-hop to a new plateau
To bridge gaps in generations for future plantations
A god-fearin' folk cos we all from the yolk
Of one breed, one seed, to good goals we proceed
Nowadays I strive to be a very good influence
Even though not too long ago I was a truant
Now I'm droppin' it on this and many broad topics
From man's obsession with money to holy prophets
Like Mohammed, yo, you know the scene is so freaky
Enemies they denounce me and my own try to sweep me
Now I got hip-hop acts posin' like fat cats
Lex and a Rolex, Moet and a top hat
But what about your contract, slick? Is you proper?
It's time we turned the tables of this hip-hop fable
I be strivin yo', tryna bang these joints out my skillet
And fulfil it, think about these kids, we can't kill it

Now every dog has his day, but eff that, it's my year
All you gat pullin' MC's could never come near
All that bogus type chatter, please put it to rest
It's the Phifer from Quest leavin' venues a mess

Wit' your simpleton (Lyrics), your light-hearted (Act)
Step back, me no have no time for dat
I'm blowin' up the spot for all you ras clot idi-ots
In a world where you have like a zillion MC's
Ninety percent of all you suckers have filthy LPs
Bitch this, trick that, come on, act like you know
I be that up north MC who never chose to play the down-low
(His name is Phife Dawg) I label myself as The Boss (True dat)
Same height as Little Vicious, yet I'm shorter than Kriss Kross
Queens representation, son, you know how we do
While Light' and Sha, they represent BK to the fullest
I be the sidekick to The Abstract, so get ready for combat
Yo, what about about them biters? Errr! Me not like that
My motto is to wreck shop, I do it on the non-stop
Come on party people, you must give me my props
Cos y'all know good and damn well that the style has been mastered
So head for the border you peasy-haired bastards
Before I start to put it on ya, come on now, must I warn ya?
Queens is in the house so all MC's go hold their corner

Get on some grown man shit and let's knock on wood
But now seeing you baby in this stall out position
Wondering who's the dime piece that you're kissing
You might as well take the jigger and take my life
Cuz the dime piece you happen to be kissing is my wife
Shit, I should have know not to let these crab asses
Get within the circle of my girl and make passes
Now you disrespected me and everything I stand for

Never ran my gibs in nuthin less than a dime

Strivin miss sunrise sometimes is known as crime
The three twenty-five got that Windex shine
And when I shot skelly, I had my boxes in lines
All I wanna do is live life and be fair
I used to stress girls with long legs and long hair
Now, I want a woman with a spiritual flair
God will never make it too hard for me to bare
I'm hungry like a derelict whose stays in the diluse
Some can count me out, but yo, I doubt that I lose

If you take all this away
And look at us at the end of the day
We stand great among creation
So baby take these words as a little inspiration
While I kick this shit get your ass motivation
MCs, you're walking a thin line
Get in your ranks and tighten up as we walk through mines
And plus vipers, phony rhymers, and biters

Who be fakin', fraudulatin', waitin' for your bacon
They'll be takin' and skatin' while you sit contemplatin'

Well let me tell you somethin' now paw
We're livin' a world that's R-A-double-raw
It's crazy but it's true, go for delly is the law
And if you cross the path then you dangerin' your jaw
And if you Glass Joe, don't go toe-for-toe
Yo all we wanna do is our thing and lay low
So brothers hold your heads high when you get down
Don't violate these women cuz we need them around
It's all of us together, not the one without the other

Got to move on through, not separate, together
Got to do our due, not separate, together
Got to move on through, not separate, together

We're gonna make this thing work out eventually

Yo, I ain't one to complain, but there's things in the game
And what's your name?
Consequence, I'm type burnt like flames
And why's that?
American dreams, they got the ghetto kid in a fiend
Don't stress that 'cause it's not in your bloodstream
Your whole being, comes from greatness, do remember
Shatan got you caught in the storms of December
And brothers on the block packing nines like September
Crazy situations keeps pockets on slender
Yo, I be on the avenue where they be actin brand new
I'm splurging on these Reebok joints for shorty boo
All of a sudden, I saw these two kids frontin'
Talking out they joints but they wasn't saying nuttin'
My hand was on my toolie, they was actin unruly
(Yo, say word) Yo, word up, yo, I was type caught up
But I swallowed my pride and let that nonsense ride
Because the positive it sees that negative die
Yo, we was at the dice game making these cats look silly
Flamming, steady running off at my Willie
I had my cash mixed, my rent due, with my play-dough
I gotta see some loot so on my girls I blow
Shook them shits in my palm, let em hit the flo'
Kept my eyeballs scoping for them pigs po-po
I got to go on the ave see my parole by fo'
But I gotta steady freak these boys like JoJo
And I was doing it, til I met Ike, Spike, and Mike
One roll, they had my pockets thirstier than Sprite
Yo, I know the feeling, when you feeling like a villain
You be having good thoughts but the evils be revealin'
And the stresses of life can take you off the right path (no doubt)
Jealousy and envy tends to infiltrate your staff
We gotta hold it down so we can move on past
All adversities, so we can get through fast, like that


You got the N.W.O. (with low cash flow)
Your baby's on the way (and you don't know who)
And crosstown niggas trying to (bust at you)
Aiiyo they got me stressed out (and you don't know what to do)

Dunn-da-lie, dunn-da-lo, dunn-da-lie, dunn-da-lee
Me no look for trouble but trouble done follow me
All I wanted to be was a illa MC
Ever since me was small as a youth out in Queens
What did you mash on de dancehall (all a me)
Until my best friend caught two in him head (Right, scene)
And ever since that day (ya not hear me?) things been a mess
R.I.P Ghosta Rock, true ting, God bless
So nowadays I go see wifey just to cure me from stress
Lay my head on her breast
Sugar dumpling knows best
Explaining all my problems to her getting things off my chest
A little hook up, squeeze up, and no more am I vexxed
Aiiyo son, without my peeps I'd be truly assed out
Make sure I have my medication so I wouldn't pass out
Native Tongues for believing in me, when everyone was fessing
Most of all Jah Mighty for the guidance and the blessings

"Peace, Prosperity & Paper","Hits, Rarities & Remixes",1996,"All we want in this life
Is peace, prosperity and a little paper
Objects, they seem greater
But I'm sure we overcome when we illin' on a drum

We in a world that places heavy emphasis on money synthesis
Y'all can be my witnesses
That a fella fascination with money has grown
To the point that he will shit on his own
We got to have it y'all, its not a Spike Lee cinematic
A piece of paper making niggas get dramatic
But the money doesn't come automatic
Gotta motivate ourselves to go and grab it
We got to get it y'all, in an orderly fashion
Some cats go about it with too much passion
We got to mediate our greedy levels
'Cause the lust of currency can have us sleepin with the devil
Gotta recognize it, realize the power
That this little ma-huckin piece of paper will devour
Man can be greater than the thing he creates
See, I'mma do my thing and see how much I can scrape
Yo, I'd rather have respect than money, no doubt
But listen to me y'all, I want the mass amount
That the Sesame Street Dracula can't Count
So that I can give my people when that thing surmounts
To higher levels.. of being.. so when I'm MC-ing
I hope to see you there steady G-ing (say word)
But the only way we can truly reach that goal
Is finding true inner peace and prospering souls
It's like that


Here comes your royal highness, one of Queens finest
Believe me, honest, you know you can't stop it
Come on son, never leave your mic 'round me
True MC for real, ask my man Shaheed
Strictly focused on what I'm in this rap game for
Not for fame and screwing every whore after whore
With all that AIDS stuff going round
Tell me how that sound
Rather hit the studio and hear some beats that pound
Now, don't get me wrong, I love honeys galore
But see hip-hop's my bread and butter
'Cause that's what I get paid for
See this is what I wanted, Allah helped me to get it
And if the beat is wicked, you know Malik will rip it
From the bottom of my heart, that's where the love starts
The love for breakdancing, my love for the art
And with this love I do hip-hop from the soul
A real MC, who never sweats how many copies are sold
Yeah, I want to go gold, platinum, uh-huh, etcetera
But why put out some wackness when no one will respect ya?
I'm staying true, nuff respect to those that paved the way
From Bambaataa down to Shah; that be my DJ
Without my peeps I don't know how the hell I'd make it, word
Sometimes I feel that my career is headed for the curb
One love for lending hand and giving all your help
Believing in me when I didn't believe in my own self
The Abstract with whom I'm always making rugged tunes
Kid Hood resting in heaven, I hope to see you soon
I keep things hot and this year they're even hotter

The Remedy,The Lost Tribes,1996,"Yo, we all got different things that we got to deal with, you nam'sayin? Sometimes, I think people always want to put the blame on something else rather than sometimes looking at ourselves. Recognizing that a lot of the stuff that happens... sometimes has to do with other things. But if we look within ourselves, we could prevent a lot of this nonsense sometimes, you know? It's about relating back to the essence, you nam'sayin', where it all stems from
. 
So I'mma do my thing over the drum like a Native Tongue, you know?
 Yeah, buss it

Do what you will, if you feel that your steeze is real
Complicated with the skills over reel to reels
Brown skin is what I feel, my mind and body's appeal
Is to the no-frill mills, who hear the beats to chill
Constantly, I'm hearing Black Americans just sneering
Looking for a leader who can fill us up with ether
Heating us up with great emotional chat
About the fact that the black's constantly held back
Like 50 tracks back in a relay race
And the white team's ahead, so let's keep up the pace
And I be needing something that could feed my logical taste
At the end of the race is there a paradise place?
Yo, we can't get involved in what the next man is doing
Material gains we put too much in pursuing
(""Yo duke, I need this dough so we can step to this party, man, word"")
But we can all Mardi Gras-di minus that shit in our body
(""Yo, what that got to do with that?"")
'Cause, kid, that's the essence
Your physical presence embodies every lesson
You can't run the Rolls Royce if the engine is busted
Can't even life the knife to cut the mustard
What we need to do first
Now listen to this verse
Let's concentrate on our spiritual plate
Recognize your existence in this vast blue space
From a tiny cloud of blood to the human beings with taste Sight, touch, smell and sound, let's deem it profound
And prioritize this 'cause it was Allah's wish
(""Allah? Yo, I'm God"")
(""I don't believe that. That's a mystery"")
(""If God is so good, yo, why this shit be happening to me?"")
There's divinity within because we come from the divine
A force that's not seen but, yo, we feel it every time
When the wind blows, and the Earth turns
And the rain drops, and the babies cry
And the birds fly, and the grounds quake
And the stars gleam
Yo, so many things are evidence of His existence
What we need to do is link it with persistence
Hear me out
Yo, once we recognize then we can move ahead
Native Tongues, Common Sense, yo, he's Hip-Hop bred...

From the spiritual world my film of life has developed
First person I lost close to me was Stella
Some of my mellows lost their mothers and their brothers
For them I feel empathy
But I ain't pouring out no fuckin' Hennessy
I pour my heart out
 when I see Dot out on the deck
Knowing two weeks ago he slap-boxed with death
I hear of niggas dying in the wind and on the news
But when it's somebody you know it hits you
And emotions get bruised
I ain't been in your shoes
I won't judge or knock you
The spirit of the ghetto say you got to
That scratch you gettin' from rock flippin'
Give back into the neighborhood, you better start kickin'
Stickin' stores on the strip
I'm tired of Arabs giving me my change back
Devil bomb my yesterday, my tomorrow he never gave back
I lay back, looking at the ceiling, wondering what could I do
So my homies won't have to be dealing
Not cause you serving and I'm rapping I'm better
Just different pieces to the puzzle of black life
That we have to put together, better ourselves
'Cause families we gotta raise
No matter how long the money, shorter become the days
Men become like wind, ain't no difference in the season
If you got popped five times, you breathing for a reason
Let's put this five-, ten-year come-up plan in progression
Before we count our papers, count our blessings

And there you have it
You know you got to grab it
It's all good, naw'mean?
Let's make it clear: the Native Tongues is in here
The JBs, De La Soul, A Tribe Called Quest, Common Sense
Busta Rhymes, Flipmode, naw'mean?
You got The Ummah, Beatnuts, Rah Digga
Consequence, Mos Def, naw'mean?
Black Sheep, Beatnuts, Queen La, Mo Love, naw'mean?

Mardi Gras at Midnight,The Lost Tribes,1996,"African-American with the power, just tapped in to the cultural gin
That be swallowin our minds, whole, but yo bust it
Empty ass rappers get me fueled and disgusted
Can't even kick a rhyme about yourself properly
Listen man I'll show you why you ain't toppin me
Epitomy of levelheadedness
Whose concern is how ill I come off and how that ill that I dress
I don't, hit you with a whole bunch of bullshit
On the microphone I keep my prose fluid
Speakin to them people in a Tongue that's Native
Not with an ego that's anti-creative
Conscious to the fact that I'm a talented lad
Make your move at a jam and feel better when sad
Hey, ""Assalamu Alaikum"" to them firm true believers
Hope yall pretty good as the message reciever
Cause yo we got to take things in-to our own hands
And be aware of these dangerous, plentiful lands
That we exist within and combat and shake on
But do it over Tribe because Tribe is the bomb
We get through, especially if you got my back
The Abstract use machete cuttin down on slab
And we do it like this, rarely do we miss
Catch you in the chest with an eagle claw fist
And back you, get it two by four and she'll lack you
Tip you only find a nigga now that out raps you
Or gets at you, and insists that you do it
Cause you make it smooth and you make it like fluid
​​
Sometimes I just be wonderin
How these cats be com-in IN
..........
I think we need to rectify this Rah
(And show these muthafuckas how we Mardi Gras)

The name's Digga and I'm on, a mission to be larger
Than them crackers that be running Time Warner 
I take it further, even runnin' shit in Persia
With acquisitions and merges
""You takin' me?"" I might have you stressin
""Your rap styles clear,"" but I'm the only danger pressin
Rah lyrics with ""UMMAH"" productions
Be phatter than a chick that had liposuction
They wasn't ready, for that which came
T'was a slim little hunny after the fat bitch sang
I break it down like quadratic equations
You luke warm, my shit hotter than Cajuns
Stop, you ain't even worth my while
Mama boy tryin to play it like he motherless child
The whole rap industry's in upheaval
They play enough times then I just might believe you
Heads was still rhymin Glock with clock
I was puttin shit together phatter than 10 Shirley Murdock's
Ain't nuthin but a buncha, thorns in my side like you was acupuncture
Bust it, playin post with me? that's unruly
No matter how bougie you'll still be a moolie
It's Rah Digga from the O-U-T's
Having bullshit rappers going ""Woe is me""

We demonstrate MCing and music
Laced with the raw P-funk you must choose it
We Buck Rogers, aiyyo we sun you like Twiggie
Girls be like (he's jiggy), and they friends be like (who is he?)
Mastering the mic like Jordan with the pill
Showing a nigga love cause a nigga got skills
A little sumthin sumthin, corny cats must flee
Rah Digga forms the lines with the Ab' MC

Ahhhhh....
Peace Tip, the love flows abundant
To Pacewon, the underdopeless and youngin
Rappers be off on a tangent
I could flow longer than the Van Wyck
Backwards Stan Smith
When I go bring the noise
I sweep rappers by the ""Bunch"" like they Brady's boys
So change your sound 'fore I claim that crown
That's for all ya'll home girls on dangerous grounds

Sometimes I just be wonderin
How these cats be com-in IN

Spontaneous, director of your own flick
Box office hit, strictly those cutting those trips
Theresa Randle type chicks, I call her ‘Girl 6’
Caramel complexion, Gucci Rush scent
Sexually intense, abstinence nonsense
Lights, camera, I’ll direct the action
Foreplay setting off

Complete satisfaction, all around attraction
Go ahead and tell, ma, now don’t it feel relaxing? Woo
Now let me be the man in the canoe

From the left, dead all the jokes and the riddles

That's on the radio it made me feel so low
It seems we gotta, brighten, the damp prison
I'm Nintendo 64 and you Mattel Intellivision
Bustin' from no mo' trey-eights, now papi weight
This joint is like a ruger, watch it roar like a cougar
And we gotta, move on the dancefloor
And work it out all night that's what you came here for
Just chem', I fills it to the rim, your shine is lookin dim
Daddy shine the light on him, ahem it's me
Leader of the starfleet force
Guaranteed to knock your joint off course, we took the loss?
Damn right, sure as tina made ike
We gonna put it in your noggin all night, and all day
The trilateral commision we dissin'
Tellin citizens be straight, but like snakes they hissin'
I'll be damned if I let his song fall to the side
Goin' piggybackin shit, let's ride, c'mon

I put it down, now what you gonna do (8x)
Hey, now, what you gonna do, with yourself, hah? (4x)

When you hear this, recognize you hear love
MC nigga illin' over b-boy dubs
Riding through the shit like tron
Doesn't matter if you onboard, do you wanna get on?
Cause if you do, watch all the moves that we make
Gotta do the things right, ain't no time for mistake
It's the hip-hop cat that can't, fuck with Jake
Just because he wear a badge doesn't, mean he straight so
What you wanna swallow it down or let's take it
Disregard those who fake it, yo it doesn't matter
About the realm, hip-hop is to the helm
It's divine to hit the mind like slippery elms

NFL GameDay, you know how we stay, word up

Joe Theismann, Sterling Sharpe, you know’m’sayin’
Brothers from ESPN
I wanna give a shout to Howie Long, Terry Bradshaw, Ronnie Lott
And the rest of the boys up at FOX, John Madden
You know’m’sayin’, this is how we do it
Mike Ditka and the crew up at NBC, Bob Costas
Whatever’s clever—take a loss never
Yo, check it, yo…

Too many crews front like they’re outta order
But probably could not manage if their name was Tom LaSorda
Rod Hampton been my man since his school days in Georgia
And then Garrison Hearst, but Herschel was first
When Malik is in the house, I want silence, no violence
Speedy Rodney Hampton and Phife, true New York Giants
Forever pushing wigs back—yo, we like it like that
I’m from the Rotten Apple—getting played, I just can’t see that
Yo, which MC’s should I start to exploit?
Got that Lion Jay Dee, roaring straight from Detroit
With mad tracks up his sleeves, you wouldn’t believe
The Ummah got more wins than that man Dan Reeves
Overachieve, ‘cause of the blessings from Jehovah
Some call Him Jah, and Muslims say Allah
But back to the matter at hand, Rodney, my man
Yo, get on the mic and do the best you can
‘Cause there’s a lot of MC’s that come with songs that ain’t strong
NFL for dat ass will stand for “Not For Long”
There’s a lot of MC’s that come with songs that ain’t strong
NFL for they ass will stand for “Not For Long”

My name is Hampton, they call me “Hot Rod”
Before stepping to me, you better pray to your God
Even folks on the West knows who’s in charge
Top 10 running backs, I never try to play large
Never step in the way of my jersey 2-7
You’re better off reading the Bible (Ask your reverend)
Always on point with that cat named Phife
When I run the ball, it’s like running for my life

(How long?) Not long (Not For Long)

Never weak, yeah, I get strong like a lion

Yeah, Malik Izaak will hit ya with that run dat sh…
Pass me the mic and watch us get intimate
Not only does it walk with me, it talks to me
Taps me on the back and says, “Son, that was a job well done”
“Why, thank you. I’m glad I could be of great service”
‘Cause it’s mad MC’s out here nowadays that sound nervous
Life is too short to still be sounding like a novice
You can’t MC, then get your ass up out my office
Brothas is like, “Oh, my head, it can’t be him again”
Bite my style like a Wolverine from Michigan
When they see my faith, them boys get stiffer than a mannequin
Been writing joints since the tender age of nine or ten
I know this year mad silly heads will be vexed with me
Especially if they know they have no strategy
Don’t step to me, I’m the one that you don’t wanna see
You know my stee, you must be drinking too much Hennessy
Phife Diggy Dawg, my title be “Mr. Melody”
You tryna play me as if my name is Stanley
Knowing damn well my style is legend like Lombardi
But in this case, it’s just for mashin’ up the party
So when you see me and my clique, keep your ass still
Or take mad L’s, exactly four like the Buffalo Bills
Me and my crew, we got more wins than George Halas
Or better yet, Tom Landry in his years out in Dallas
You try to test the Kennel Club, two to your jaw
Keeping it new and improved like the Ravens from Baltimore

What? What what? (Ha ha)
What what? (Ha ha) What what? (Ha ha)
It’s like that, son (Yeah); it’s like that, son (Yeah)
Phife Diggy Dawg, you best believe I’m the one
Not the two, not the three, not the four

Keep it live, represent the Tribe
Not the one, not the two, not the three, not the four

It seems cats nowadays be gettin' introduced to courage
Don't get discouraged 'cause my words are fluid like flourish
We got the bounty, we from the Queens county
Overlookin' things like a Rushmore Mounty
And got no other choice except to get a little love
We rise above, the beat be fittin' like a glove
The pain in my heart is getting dosed by joy
We have no other ploy but to bring the B-boy
There's nothing on this Earth that can instill fear
The locomotive, puttin' my thing in gear
I only have the fear of God and that's taqwa
You need Binaca; your trap is blazing like Blanka
I got the lethal, you couldn't put a match to it
Let me know, yo, where we could do it like Stuart
Mind over matter, action is needed
When the big one not to be superseded
Responsibility is somethin' I can't deny
The illegalties is the nonsense reply
Most cats who scramble do so because they want to
But known to kick rhymes in the past on impromptu
My willy's hot like two links in the skillet
A room filled with speakers, one stage, watch me kill it
Knowledge should be sought from the cradle to the grave
Rhyming opposition get it twist like Super Dave
You be looking bug just like Uncle Jesse
Don't make the scene messy
'Cause it'll jump, that's word to Aunt Bessie
Profound sentences of pure lyric gems
Some of my friends be liking people with stems
Folks be on the chase for this cheddar
Thinkin' it makes your life better
But it can make you ass out
And when I'm at a show chicks never pass out
We got the joints to make the whole Mash Out out
A Tribe Called Quest make the party go down
Plus we bring positive vibes to fill up all your crowns
Lyrics comes to cats like a hot and cold flash
Some can come with ease, therefore, it's in a smash
Held the fort down like the Justice League hall of Super Friends
But in the world turmoil spins
Brothers walk the street with the ill pace face
City life breeds contempt for each race
All praises due to Allah and I should say it
It's The Abstract motivator making things clear
Puttin' things in perspective to rock and roll
'Cause you know this kid has got wild soul
Americana makes drama like starved-out piranha
Cold like ice, jet hot like a sauna
It's the haves verse the have-not
And guess who's arrived in the hood
Exposing all wrongs, it's all good
Ayo, word up, hip-hop is live like a wire
Let's get a little bit before the whole joint expire
I got to stress it again, this here is for my kin
And all my babies, children of the world, no maybe's
So, yo, we gotta move through and push through
Because we gotta make it happen, keep it true blue
It's like that
So much confusion goin' on
So much confusion goin' on
Inside all mine
Inside all mine
So much confusion goin' on
Uh, uh, uh, uh
But everything will be fine
So much confusion goin' on
So much confusion goin' on

Gotta make it alright

Because we prone to make the party go bump bump bump bump bump bump bump where you is
If you the baby daddy then uplift the kids
Get back and plan, don't be on front flossin'
Incognito, you heard the name quite often
You dressed in black and been issued a coffin
I thrive on this plane, you off to the lost one
Like cayenne pepper, it gets hot, nothin' better
From each little dash it get the whole smash
It's tasty too, so satisfy your whole palate
Fake ID's are revoked and invalid
Infractin' bodies out on the dance floor
Is what I wanna see, not less but much more
The lyrics just spewed, he got good reviews
The kid made the news, how he left no clues
On how he just murdalized the whole damn jam
He just got results that's smiles and waved hands
The mission could never be accomplished, however
Until we bounce to an island with hot weather
And still we'll be able to rock and rip crowds
While other emcees say nuthin' and talk loud
While other emcees say nuthin' and talk loud

Shake your money maker

Teasing me, just like Tisha did Martin

Schoolboy's crush and it ain't on the hush
The whole world sees it but you can't (uh)
My peoples they complain, sit and rave and rant (come on)
Your name is out my mouth like an ancient chant (say what?)
Got me like a dog as I pause and pant
*heavy breathing*

Speaking of which
Got a leash and I wish just to rock you miss (C'mon)
Make a militant move, peep my strategy (What?)
End of the day you're not mad at me (Ugh)
Not dealing with nobody, now that's what you told me (What?)
I said, ""Hey yo, it's cool, we can just be friendly"" (C'mon)
'Cause yo, picture me messing it up
Her mind not corrupt, with the ill C-cups
Shit, I'm on my J.O. (C'mon)
Bullshitting, hoping that the day goes slow (what?)

Is kisses when we breeze, tell me what's the deal, yo?

Should I just sit out or come harder? (huh?)
Help me find my way

Now why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Making things for me towards you harder
Killing me, just when I think we're there
You douse the whole vibe and the flows in the air
Telling me 'bout next man
But next man ain't the nigga with the plan
Who got your heart in mind?
It's about time that you just unwind (C'mon)

And let it just happen, make it front-free (uh)
Just sweat me like Moneypenny (uh)
Digging you, getting inside of your stee (what?)
It's the Quest cat keeping you company (ha)
Forever, or however you want it

Word, word
Now wait a minute, ma, before you jet into the curb (Yeah, yeah)
Start to make affections, which is goo,d not the herb
But it, it ain't me, and I, I ain't blurred (Ugh)
I'ma still just chill with you
Maybe things could change if you change your view (C'mon)
If not, then, I guess it is cool (Yeah)
Just to keep to yourself and abide by the rules, right

Like that y'all
Check it out now...
Check it out now...
Like that now...
Check it out now...
Wha wha now...
Check it out now...
Yeah yeah now...
Check it out now...
Check it out now...
It's like that now...
Check it out now...
Yeah yeah now...
Check it out now... (Ahem)
What you say, what? what?

Now you caught my heart for the evening (Talk it out now)
Kissed my cheek, moved in, you confuse things
Should I just sit out or come harder?
Help me find my way (Now sing it)
Now you caught my heart for the evening (Sing it out)
Kissed my cheek, moved in, you confuse things (Take your time)
Should I just sit out or come harder?
Help me find my way (Now talk it out)
Now you caught my heart for the evening (Talk it out now)
Kissed my cheek, moved in, you confuse things
Should I just sit out or come harder?

Like It Like That,The Love Movement,1998,"We was in the back of the joint cooling out
And I saw this girl, asked her if she like it like that (Ugh)
Nod her head yes, therefore I didn't stress
Let my beat keep knocking cause we rock it like that
Bust your ass slow, as if you didn't know
Put my mic inside your brain zone, don't dis, hold this
It's the rhyme, it's the beat that vibe all together
That makes the competitors sound like this
Rarely do I care yo, I let down my hair
When the music's up loud, man, I jones real bad
Lyric overload, in club, in the boat
In Jeep in America, Tribe goin' mad
Females ride when my niggas just ride
With the songs we creating and musically relating
Sex niggas talk, black bodies in chalk
Meanwhile they boot shaking on some punk shit, faking
Wait, I can't front, stick men
Who really gon' do what they say they come to do
What they say gonna do
Back at the ranch, there's no Carte Blanche
Everybody gonna move when we say move

Do you like it?
Say yeah if you like it like that (YEAH)
Do you like it?
Hell yeah if you like it like that (HELL YEAH)
Do you like it?
Tell me if you like it like that (YEAH)
Do you like it?
Verse two if you like it like that (COME ON)

Who could be the one, rhyming ill, having fun
Blowing up, making musical memories and things
Elevate your thoughts on the vibe that we brought
While we climbing, we shine like a Super Bowl ring
You could do it too, I mean hop like we do
Interlock like we do and make your own mark
It's deeper than the song, hope you live your life long
When you win, how you start, kid you gotta have heart
Niggas in my shit, move! Give a nigga room
Back it up, it's a grown man making on time (Making on time)
Plus you damn similar to Newport's
Smoking ain't a new sport
Smoke you since the invent of rhyme
Gotta spread love, no matter where you are
Where you at, where you went, 'cause nobody want beef
Fountain is good, just flows like a river
Just go with a nigga, kid, my stay ain't brief
Put your heart in the day, in the night, family
Enemies but yo I, really don't wet that
We was in the back of the joint cooling out
And I saw this girl asked if her if she like it like that, yo

You like it that, you like it that
You like it that, you like it that
You like it that, you like it that

When we move, yes (Mhm!)
Sometimes we lay low (Mhm!), aiyyo (Yo)
Big up my little nigga Pedro
Make you after the L like turkey, cheese and to-ma-to ('-to)
Fuck is that? Especially for niggas that will pay no
Attention to instructions, like they still wan' disobey y'all
Wonder Twin powers activate real quick
So that I could grow about five feet more with an extra dick
One dick to hold in my hand when I'm rockin the mic
The extra dick to blow up the pussy for the rest of the night
Then I return with more lyrics like a bunch of rough niggas
They tough niggas that snuff niggas (Hah)
I know the club got enough niggas (Huh!)
To slap your face, expert
Who the next jerk to make me exert heat?
Fuck it, let me network!

Hence the reason why your bitch ass would love to follow (What?)
Two different toasters in your chest will make your shit hollow
How's about them apples, oh is it too hard to swallow?
Push your wig back, word to Big Moot and Bolo
Billy Razor, Fudge Lover, on down to Sha and Litro (Love Movement)

Five-foot invasion son, you can't run from it

Yo Reggie Noble! (Blaoowww)
(Yo, Phife Diggy!) What up?
Yo, yo, Kamaal it's your time to step up!

Check it out, the original, shit, we makin it
Takin it, to the extremes, we breakin it
When we get, inside a zone then you feel that it's good
All you jelly cats stop marinatin my wood
Niggas, grab the mic with loads of malarky
I bring the knowledge and wield the anarchy
Put it on pooh-butts who's unsettled with ignorance
Give the last sentence with poignance and diligence
Eighteen wheelin through niggas like truckers
Breakin ankles, put it on like we at the ruckus
Guaranteein that shorty can move it around
In the place that gets you hot but leaves you here on the ground
Contenders don't you even think to challenge the crown
Of these brothers who so elequently hold the beat down
Fuck the rigamarole, we vyin for the control
We the musical equation of the whole entire nation

Yo Phife Dawg! (Yes Kamaal)

Yo, yo! I'm just a ill nigga who don't got it all upstairs
Riding dick, get the balls til they come in pairs
Oh yeah, throw the goggles on these engineers
Cause it might, get kinda wet when I spit this here
Yo, I'm six-foot-one with a big ass gun
To carry it you'd need a waistline the size of Big Pun
But I move crowds without a gun
Like if... (The New York State Lottery is ninety-nine million!!)
Hah-hah, yo, when it's time to flow, I suprise and blow
Five hundred thousand units off a dime a trow
Forty below, I'm thorough when it's time to throw

Put your money on Queens, yo these cats is pissed
Meanin hot green and stinky, see shorty there winkin?
Hit her off so hard, that her eyes start blinkin
Then massage her down, with the word serene
It's the Dawg For Pres, new star on the scene

And some pirates and thieves try to take?

I give my promise to all y'all to keep my shit hittin'
Half of y'all claim dog but meow like kitten
Flippin' on brothers just like Mary Lou Retton
Get off that ass and see what I'm settin'
Born with this inside, you just can't get it
This is the lethal pop and you have no weapon
Who is the native brother who keep asses steppin'
Make deep impressions and constantly be reppin'

When I was young I'd stretch gaucho
Now I'm on Letterman, on the couch, yo
The black thing with knives is called the back do'
Can't we be cool instead of being foul though
Ghetto child dreams of fast cars and fast dollars
Impressions of live sometimes makes ya holler
Scream all that devil shit and talk like a scholar
You dumb as a doorknob, and why do you bother

Phife Dawg puttin' the bite back in yours
Top dog, puttin' it up, flick his balls
MC from now til I get a frown
Shake that ass girl because you world renowned
Wake up, look at the sun, see the sights
Bull duke, you've got to die for your rights
MC's, y'all got to work for the mic
Zombies, do it from dusk to the night

Rock to the beat, yo it's never the same
Good girls usually got good game
Hot cats tearin' that ass out the frills
Block ass, you had no skills, that's the reals
Make this money without the friction
Take this honey, there goes your diction
Rappers better retreat, fix your joints
My whole crew got bumps on they points

Rumors being spread 'bout me and my click
We can't rock shows and our rhymes ain't shhh
Might not've heard it, or maybe you have
Between me and you, they can kiss my ass
Used to get angry, used to get quite vexed
But say what you may, just cash my check
Cause all I'm ever guilty of is going on tour
Doing shows galore, and bringin' it raw

So many people, right now
Motivated to do some bullshit over some bullshit ass reasons
But we 'bout to put it inside of a love perspective like
Love movement

We do it all for the love y'all
Yeah, we do it all for the love y'all
Whether white, black, Spanish, ain't a thug y'all
We do it, we give it all for the love y'all
We just givin' it all for the love y'all
We do it, we do it all for the love y'all
We in the party, put your hands up
Yeah y'all, we do it all for the love y'all

Love getting down and I love a cool breeze
Love seein' checks from record companies
Love lovin' love cause I love what I do
And we do our thing for the one nine two
And the rest of the country cause we from there too
Makin' sure love is givin' when I get it from you
Everybody, we regulate the party and shit
Love it when I get a little rugged wit' it
Love the circumstance to make my dough flow right
Love rockin' mics plus the ill style nights
She does it real good but love'll make it mo' better
Got me kind of open in the DK sweater
Love when my peoples come home from jail bids
Really love women and I really love kids
Love tight clubs where the music just bang
Camp-ass with gas women or shorty got bangs
Lovin' it
Yo yo, I'm lovin' it
Love a woman when she got a tight outfit
Outfit meaning outlook and disposition
You love it when a nigga does a love composition
Love peanut butter and jelly on wheat
Wylin' out, makin' hot shit to hot beats
From Ohio to Poughkeepsie
From Phoenix to NC
From Cali to DC
Love it when the pressure falls right on me
Love it when God keeps on overlookin'
Do a tight show so promoters keep bookin'

We do it all for the love y'all
Yeah, we do it all for the love y'all
We get the paper but it's still for the love y'all
From the heart inside of the heart y'all
We do it, we do it all for the love y'all
For real, for the love, for the love y'all
All my peoples in the ghettos, for the love y'all
All my peoples all around, for the love y'all
For the love love

For my crews bomb, where my peoples still at
If they call me and I don't call back
Four weeks at a time, love is still intact
Let's be big about it, and realize the fact
Love it, when the underdog comes through
Ghetto rebel rise to overthrow these rules
Love it, when I get spared another day
Used to drink zay while my niggas weighed yay
Love it, when I gain control over this
Life is really bigger than the Roley on my wrist
Got a twist to this shit and the answer's inside
Sho as the world's small and the Mississippi's wide
Had to rock a vest over unchoosed stress
Now I see people rockin' theirs in jest
Love it when my loved one really hold me down
Brand new flight and I'm takin' off ground

We do it all for the love y'all
Check it out, we do it all for the love y'all
For the love y'all, for the love y'all
For the love, for the love y'all
We get the paper but it's still for the love y'all
Yo, we do it all for the love y'all
For everybody, for the love for the love y'all
Whether white, black, Spanish, ain't a thug y'all
Yeah, we givin' y'all this shit, the love y'all
Just the love inside of the heart y'all

We got the good shit not the bullshit, You know what I mean? Ha hah
We bout to count it down, we bout to count it off
It goes a-one, two, three, and...

Malik we gettin back into that shit again
And when we rhyme, brothers need to break they pens, uh-oh
It's The Love Movement never ends
The rap game'll never be the same again
(Phife Dawg where you at baby?) We came again

Here I come again, you feelin fine?
The Dawg is like a overflowin rhyme from mind
Usually mess with shorties whose a 8 or 9
Shorty bump around to the bass-line

F keeps a burner on the waist-line
Y'all cat's trick it off, I ain't wastin mine
You feel the uniqueness, you seekin this?
And when we do it, we be freakin this

Don't even front, you know you feelin this
My shade is borderin around licorice (licorice)
Enjoyin this tune, glad you playin it

One love, one life, and one destiny
It seems that the devil keeps testin me
Got the illest part of the recipe
Yo tell your homegirl to stop stressin me (stop it)
Undressin me is the part you really like
Brothers hold the cracks now they holdin mics
The cusses you get, they feelin steady rights
Marauders, we did that shit at Mid-night, a-ah-aight-aight

I love it when my honeydip be slobbin me
Don't take it personal, it's just comedy
My comedy completely turned to tragedy
I sense some of these rappers still be mad at me
Sweatin her because of her anatomy
When I bang you it'll be assault and battery
Don't make me discombobulate your microphone
Talkin trash will only get you freakin head, flown

Uhh, buy em out the box, never batty ones
Get in that ass like karate son
My outlook on life, sometimes it's lookin grim
We manage a smile, sometimes we slip it in

My Tribe be worldwide like the Nike swoosh
Emcees be soundin moist like vagina juice
The top of the world, we pursuin it
Don't worry about a thing, cause we doin it
DOIN IT, DOIN IT
Chorus 2X

That's the way we do.. c'mon, that's the way we do

Hot 4 U,The Love Movement,1998,"Knew a girl named Shelley, six-pack belly
When we made love she made it shake like jelly
Put her own video star on my tele
Lived in the Bronx on the block named Fteley
Had to be jetty cause this other ho Netty
Kept blowing me up, her jonesing was steady
Told my man Louie that I really wasn't ready
Louie when we did it, man, we both got sweaty

This girl from my past had ridiculous ass
She attended UMASS and she passed every class
Walked down the hall with her stuck up sass
Talked to basketball players
She liked how they passed
But when I use to hit it, the bullcat she quit it
She wouldn't admit it but shorty was addicted
(Say Word) Word, nigga you heard
Like a fiend with a queen when he catches the bird

Knowing how we living I'mma talk about Mayo
Sagittarian mami, her love was a KO
We was on the under, had to stay on the lay low
Used to go so deep that she used to say A-yo
Rocked with her friend but her friend drove both way
Asked her about it and she used to say no way
Just let it go yo, I used to say OK
Just another day but Phife, anyway

I put it down man, what you gon' do

Well, I put it down son, what you gon' do

We put it down for the area crew
All the shortys that's smoking y'all whoo
Looking good if you sipping on your brew
Come here ma, we make it hot for you
( the truth) Come here ma, we make it hot for you
(Ali Shaheed) Come here ma, we make it hot for you
Come on Phife

Met a shorty named Kenny from East Saint Louie
Body good and plenty, the finest in Missouri
If you had no money, you better hit the highway
Even in her own right, she had to do it her way

It was an ill situation when I met Dantanya
Worked in Saint Louis in her mother's hair parlor
Use to hit her man for cake to come see me
Her and her man from home, they sold heemey
We had it hemmed, locked, sold and shit
When I dug her yo she said I was the ultimate
Broke her up kid, driving the drill like Truck Turner
All other things they did not concern her
People that we love yo, we love with a passion
I'm the type of cat that brings forth the action
You feeling me yo, I hope you hearing me yo
One more thing before you start cheering me yo

I put it down man, what you gon' do

Well, I put it down son, what you gon' do

We put it down for the area crew
All the shortys that's smoking y'all whoo
Looking good if you sipping on your brew
Come here ma, we make it hot for you
Come here ma, we make it hot for you
Come here ma, we make it hot for you

And you don't stop, and you don't quit
Unless you're in the studio doin wack shit
Yo check it

Boom batta, watch your teeth shatter
All that shit you pop in your jams, it won't matter
Bust your whole grill, now watch that joint shatter
I'm the Captain of the ship, FUCK a William Shatner
Emcees be poppin shit when they sweeter than cake batter
Claimin they style be fat, but guess whose style is fatter?
The ill beat jacker, emcee attacker
Fuckin with the Diggy it don't, get no blacker
Malik Izaak Taylor, ey the stress reliever
Brown eyed shorty, chocolate like Godiva
Fuck what you heard I'll make YOU a believer
Me gettin burnt, that's like a white girl named Shareema
You never see her, cause she's the black like Sarafina
Set shit off like Latifah, single like Khadijah
So girls with fat asses and tits, nice to meet ya
Do five plus five equals ten? Ask your teacher
For God so loved the world he said Phife, ask your preacher
Love to toot my own Horne, similar to Lena
Before I take stage, I take sips of Aquafina
Fucked Judy Jetson, now they call me Jet Screamer
Love my coffee dark so you can keep your dairy creamer
Tribe fallin off, well youse a got damn dreamer

Hah, yaknahmean?
A word up a word up a word up a word up yo
Have you ever wondered what make a crowd rock?
Tribe Called Quest we haffa do it non-stop
Listen to the radio we're never goin pop cause

Rock Rock Y’all,The Love Movement,1998," Yo! We about to rock this joint, from the family. And
We want ya'll all to know, that it's time...
CHORUS (all):
To rock rock ya'll
Freak freak ya'll
To the beat ya'll
It's unique ya'll (2x)

A-yo praise the master, make plans wit' your pastor
My rap'll blast ya, send you to the hereafter
I push a tractor, for horses grazin' in the pasture
Ya heard I was trickin', the whole room filled with laughter
In ciphers, I'm the one you don't rhyme after
You only know half of the math, it don't add up
The lead batter, my hits make ya frame shatter
Watch me now! Just begun like Jimmy Castor
I'm bad luck just like walkin' under ladders
Mad rappers, book of life, last chapter
Me and my squad build just like contractors
I break shit, you only give hairline fractures
Women flash us, don't know ya better ask us
A bastard, wit' more contacts than Lens Crafters
Tear down the rafters, 
venereals couldn't clap us
You need practice, hit chicks then I'm Casper

The church of scientology, feminine biology
Manic depressive psychologically, A.D.D. alive and we
Polluted by technology, the fumes and its ecology
While your thought you was out of copy I get nastier than sodomy
Probably an oddesey, started back on robbery
Was the degree of the economy that do the sovereignty
Regarded as a prodigy, leery in sociology
Let the wallabees always conceal my gynecology
Rhymin' pathologically, that's how it gotta be!
Never makin' no apology, worshippin' my anthropology
Fuck modesty, studyin' microbiology
Causin' verbal lobotomy, it's in my geneology
Six months of sobriety, movin' very methodically
Like a unicorn, more ways than oceanography
Guard technology, rip shows antibiotically
True thugs bionically, give birth to criminology

Yo as a youngin', I swear to God you couldn't tell me nothin'
I swore I was gettin' somethin', clothes-on humpin'
For girls with the church, slacks with some shirts tucked in
I set it up for money, my mom worked when I was cuttin'
Unsigned strugglin', for the heat I lit the oven
One would by the CD, the other would do the dubbin'
Before I met Rob, I was in the clubs frontin'
Oh yeah I know the Tip, when I see him I be duckin'
But now when I'm clubbin', those that used to dis were buggin'
Overweight chicks, spandex, they stomachs sucked in
Stay interruptin', dance and try to cut in
Told people you got in free when you really snuck in

We never get concerned about who's in the league
We just stay workin' so no one will need
An unconcerned outsider givin' niggas feed
My niggas puff weed but negotiate the seed
The family is granite and you can't intercede
I try to switch lanes at this operatin' speed
Cats in the game be gamblin' with greed
We the house, you the player and we gonna catch these
Who's the Sam Sneed makin' microphones bleed
Poker face creed while my mind just read
Shorty got rhythm but her freak got freed
That's insignificant but this take heed

They say I'm pretty like Clay is, bright like the day is
Beats from my fleet be sweet like Sugar Ray is
I'm swingin' this from Bay Ridge to where the Oakland Bay is
My game is tough to play, I'm tough to weigh like your safe is
The aim is, to make you recognize what the name is
Mos Def gon' set it straight from where the 718 is
The place with the greats who originate the flavors
An all-star block with some all-star neighbors
(Turn the music down!) This is probably some haters
Achin' cuz they hear us rotatin' on the playlist
From B-boy laces to Detroit gators
Yo Tip I got to bail, where the scale? Help me weigh this...
Yo! We wan't ya'll to know...that this is the family, right?
And what we want everybody out there to do...on the dance floor...
Is get ready...because noooowwwwww we gonna...

Welcome to the movement, the fifth wit' improvement

I make it easy for ya'll to boogie down to
Hard to the ground, ooh the Tribe with the sound boo
Touch me, tease me, feed me, squeezy
Take it easy, never sleazy
Promise that I will not answer
The phone when it rings love, while we do out thing love
Never fakin', enslave spirits
Through the music is our mission
Money's cool, but not cooler than a ghetto rebel risin'
To overthrow a ruler
Dearly beloved, dearly departed
There's a reason why we did it
Cuz it's inside the body and the hearts
So here we are fam let's start, c'mon...

Can you feel it when we do it
Truth, power, taste, devour
Niggas in the street here comes the illest beat now
Move oceans wit' your mental
Think it, do it, be it, embellish
Here's another point for everyone to relish
When Ski busts his tools all ya'll foes will embellish
For somethin' wicked at ya'll faces
What I see is longin', needin'
Hey I got you with that goooooood stuff
And ya probably won't get enough
Ay-yo, lyrics I got it, lyrics, cadence
Do it with fun and patience
Funky, rhythmic, characteristic
Ebonically lingustic wit' the ghetto futuristic
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay....

Beat me in the head, don't beat me in the head
Don't beat me in the head, don't beat me in the head

Common Ground (Get It Goin’ On),The Love Movement,1998,"Q-Tip:
Who that at the door? (Yo, Tip, it's her)
What you doin here, in front of my face? (repeat 3X)
You didn't want my...you didn't want it
So go somewhere where you are wanted
But if you want to, then you can come here
Come here, yo
Q-Tip:
Have you ever met a woman that just took your breath? (yeah uh huh uh uhuh, yeah uh huh)
So deep inside her life, she contemplated death (damn she deep, give a fella the creeps)
Can't help but get attached to a woman like that (true that)(repeat 4X)
The contact was quite immediate, I had to attack
(Because you the man, yo, you know you the man)
We related and debated over food and tunes
Started out in September, now we enterin June (say word)(repeat 4X)
Simple night in the crib, no, it just won't do
(no it just won't do, no it just won't do)
Because she liable to start shit too wild for you
(wild for you, wild for...)
She wanna push my whip, buy diamond chips
And take on trips, conversin my flip
Gotta do her hair, take her out to the fair
Win a teddy bear, make sure you don't stare
At another one comin, don't be startin nuthin
Be a slave to her, don't be brave to her
Make sure that she's right, make sure that you're wrong
When she wants it, do it, make sure that it's long
If anyone wanna make it work it's me (Phife Dawg help me out)(repeat 2X)
But we gotta come to a common ground baby
Any man, he can claim to be the one for you
But put it straight to yourself and realize what's true
Chorus:
And if it's me then let's get it going on (repeat 4X)
Get it going on, let's get it going on
And if it's me then let's get it going on (repeat 2X)
Q-Tip:
Phife Dawg in the break, is she more than you can take?
Phife:
See, I'm not the one to be taken advantage of
And if you really think about it, I got nuthin but love
Now if your heart isn't in it, please let me know
There's no need to waste time, if it's no, then I'll go
Chorus:
And if it's me then let's get it going on (repeat 4X)
Get it going on, let's get it going on
And if it's me then let's get it going on (repeat 2X)

Give me, to everyone in the world

Yo in Iraq, all my niggas love Abstract

Every time a nigga rhyme it's like we get our bus' on
I used to ride a dollar van and really get my bus on
Yo, from South Don to El Segundo
All my niggas getting high yo, and still living on the run though
Get a lot of dough so now we have a lot of fun though
Q-U, two E's, N-S
All we really care about is money, cheeba and sex
What what what

Niggas get faded, never outdated
Give it to the world cause for long they waited
Shorties online to cop the new CD
So Hip Hop I bust nut in graffiti
We could two-piece it or we could just cease it
Shorty on my shit cause my style wild decent
What's it gonna be, the party or the precinct?
Queens cats rock, keep it rugged and recent
My nigga Nore thug it out (thug it out, no doubt)
Phife Dawg bugging out (bugging out, no doubt)
The Love Movement no doubt (Love Movement, no doubt)
Ali Shaheed get a shout (shout it out, no doubt)

Yo perate, hold on, take a time out
Huddle up, yo, Queens niggas won't fuck it up
Keep my Southside niggas just playing the cut
While my Queensbridge people stay roughing you up
East Elmhurst, Corona, Ayatollah
Keep the caller ID on the Motorola
Gotta keep the po-po on the payola
Queens niggas shut it down, now it's all over

192, the Bouley Fran Lew
Merrick, Van Wyck, Hollis Ave, Guy Brew
Head up Jamaica Ave cop a tape by DJ Clue
Move to the Acres, sipping on a guinney brew

Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Mr. Incognito is back again
Now all I want is peace and papes, and a physical friend
Jottin down my list of positives in life
I want a ride, crib, mutt, wife
The look on my grill is filled with conviction
Gonna get what I need, delete restriction
Babble on the boulevard to brother hood buddies
Pokin in my pocket it's the E for the moneys
Jay and all the jokes that jet in the Jettas
While I'm 
at the boob tube watchin Baretta
Swig up on a forty cause I'm feelin thirsty
Mama says she taught me, better say she cursed me
Throwin on my hoodie, low-profilin
Wassup with the Tipster? Brotherman be wylin
But I be on mission that's beyond eye level
Questin out the devil and his pals that are several
Quest with the Questers or Quest on a solo
Boomin in a Benzo, Beamer or a Bronco
Boom caca a boom boom, boom caca a boom
If my sight isn't seen, silly saps will assume
That we fallin off the Earth with the Nina and the Pinta
The Five Foot Assassin with the shade of magenta

Magenta is the shade for the mystic parade
Physical Trini born, lyrically, I am swayed
Livin off Linden, 1-92nd
Chillin at the rest, other brothers wreck it
Easy like a morning, Commodore Sunday
Waited for a Tuesday, for 
manic Monday
When I woke Wednesday, persons was poundin
Don't know the whereabouts, can't be foundin
Feelin' for the feelin' for the one they call the Phifer
Still on the smooth but a tidbit hyper
Get with the get on as I hit the D-L
It's my thing what I bring, I try to do it well
You can bet your bottom dollar that the Tribe will not be slippin
Makin hit after hit as we commence to start rippin
People think I'm buggin
 or I have the heebiejeebies
The reason they can't find me is because they can't see me


It's like the war's going on in the middle of your mind
But your mind can't contain Incognito's on the brain
So you chill by yourself
Don't really sweat nobody
Speak to all the brothers and say peace to every hottie
But lurking in the ghetto is a germ that insists
Should you back the germ away? Or utilize your fists
Neither of the two, just continue with your thoughts
And 
wash away your pain with the power of the quart
Ain't got no time for girls, 'cause girls be on some bull
Checkin for a nigga who got crazy pull
On some deep-rooted sexual, highly intellectual
Not checking for the fame although it's perpetual
I entered the world the same way I'll exit
If you really dig the groove, then hey, glad you checked it
'Cause Incognito's strong, not irking like a blister
Before you speak about me, make sure you call me Mister",https://genius.com/A-tribe-called-quest-mr-incognito-lyrics

For all of y'all
We like to play
We like to ball
This is a story
For all of you
When we do our thing
We got to do it true

Sittin in my canvas in the corner of my room
12:45 as the radio booms
Paging you six times
Call you on your cell but it's just a bad line
It's a full moon so I'm bout to howl
Thinkin for a slight, ""Is my girl on the prowl?""
Naw, I guess she wouldn't violate us
Plus hittin' gets for real and she doesn't like to fuss
Callin up the shorty that I met four weeks
On the street, lookin sweet, and I was about to eat
Conscious of my lady but we was on the outs
Had mad love but I had mad doubts
On the phone talkin, gettin on my swerve
But thinkin bout my lady, guess I had some nerve
We was still dreamin and I had a little shot
Cause I didn't even hear it when the door unlocked
""Damn, where the hell was you at?
Damn, why you comin in late?
Damn, where the hell was you at?
Damn, where the hell was you at?
Damn, why you comin in late?
Damn, where the hell was you at?
Damn, why you comin in late?""
Now she standin over me, I said ""I gotta go""
Turned around quick but I hung it up slow
""What's the deal, love, what's goin on?
I see it in ya face, just tell me what's wrong""
""Mm, nothin, I think we need to speak""
""Mm, okay, well, just have a seat""
She wears a frown, she lookin 'round
Sweat comin down and she doesn't make a sound
Tappin on the table growin impatient
I'm gettin up and now I start pacing
She says ""Alright!"" as she starts to conversate
""I'ma do what you do"" then I say ""Elaborate""
""Well you got that girl on the side
What if I had a guy then, too?
Would your heart be broken, boy?
I'd wonder what you do""
""Are you tellin me you got a dude
Who's lovin you better than me?""
""No, but I caught ya ass
So I guess I'm settin you free""
""Yeah, whatever"" as a standin pride
""Me and her is only friends though, we never end, yo
We're gonna still tie intimate ends, yo
I think so, my shit is on lock, ho""
""Word? That's how it's goin?
Well I guess it was really good knowin""
""I'ma still just keep in contact""

The irony is that this bad bitch in my lap
She don't love me, she make money, she don't study that
She gon' give it to me, ain't gon' tell me run it back
She gon' take the brain to wetter plains, she spit on that

VH1 has a show that you can waste your time with
Guilty pleasures take the edge off reality
And for a salary I'd probably do that shit sporadically
The OG Gucci boots are smitten with iguanas
The IRS piranha see a nigga gettin' commas
Niggas in the hood living in a fishbowl

False narratives of Gods that came up against the odds

It's kismet that we're cosmic with the stars

You bastards overlooking street art
Better yet, street smarts but you keep us off the charts
So motherfuck your numbers and your statisticians
Fuck y'all know about true competition?
That's like a AL pitcher on deck talking about he hittin'
The only one who's hitting are the ones that's currently spittin'
We got your missy smitten rubbing on her little kitten
Dreaming of a world that's equal for women with no division
Boy, I tell you that's vision
Like Tony Romo when he hitting Witten
The Tribe be the best in they division
Shaheed Muhammad cut it with precision
Who can come back years later, still hit the shot?
Still them tryna move we off the fucking block

Hardest spit in the city y’all niggas spitting kitten soft
Confused and amazed, shook up with your brain missing lost
They planning for our future, people
None of our people involved
Pouring Henny and Smirnoff to get it cracking off
Cracking off a Smirnoff to quickly turn to Molotov
Molotov the spaceship doors before that bitch is taking off
It always seems the poorest persons
Are people forsaken, dawg
No Washingtons, Jeffersons, Jacksons
On the captain's log
They’d rather lead us to the grayest water poison deadly smog
Mass un-blackening, it’s happening, you feel it y’all?
Rather see we in a three-by-three structure with many bars
Leave us where we are so they can play among the stars
They taking off to Mars, got the space vessels overflowing
What, you think they want us there? All us niggas not going
Reputation ain’t glowing, reparations ain’t flowing
If you find yourself stuck in a creek, you better start rowing
Used to see the TV screen as the place to land my dream in
And the car stereo where they would promote the show
Optimistic little brother with a hope you know

(Move on to the stars)
There ain’t a space program for niggas
Yeah, you stuck here, nigga

There ain’t a space program for niggas

Sit and wonder sometimes, I read the paper every day
All these happenings is cycular, just happen different ways
And the president's refined, in her wing she's confined
With about thirty Percocets and five bottles of wine
Carolina nothing finer than a Black woman who climbs
To the top of the State building claiming that that flag is mine
Now, people on top of people, feels like we can’t breathe
Put so much in this muthafucka, feel like we shouldn't leave
Put it on TV, put it in movies, put it in our face
These notions and ideas and citizens live in space
I chuckle just like all of y'all, absurdity, after all
Takes money to get it running and money for trees to fall
Imagine for one second all the people are colored, please
Imagine for one second all the people in poverty
No matter the skin tone, culture or time zone
Think the ones who got it
Would even think to throw you a bone?
Moved you out your neighbourhood, did they find you a home?
Nah cypher, probably no place to
Imagine if this shit was really talkin’ about space, dude
Imagine if this shit was really talkin’ about space, dude
Imagine if this shit was really talkin’ about space, dude

We a show me generation, show us what you gon' show us
So listen, mami, see we could collude with a boing
Mouthpiece like Goines, with a jubilant noise
Dudes rude and 
as useless as coins
, shoot 'em boys
Versed in, rehearsed in the soothing of loins
Talk to Joey, Earl, Kendrick, and Cole, gatekeepers of flow
They are extensions of instinctual soul
It's the highest in commodity grade
And you could get it today

One hitting reading pages of Poe
Telly is low, cuddle bunny ready to go
Day of the dead
Bury all the zombies instead
And it's just your aftermath, Busta cuttin' your dreads
Bruce Leein' niggas, while you niggas UFC
Smoke tree on niggas, sizzle out your USB
(Surge pricing on these Ubers, I'mma get me a cab)
Yo, where Jarobi at?
Imbibing on impeccable grass
I be in NYC waiting for that law to pass
(Pass shit, been waiting for a Jet's title since last
Richard Todd, Todd Bowles, gang green on that ass)
Magic Mike on the mic, David Blaine, Douglass Henning
In the church of Busta Rhymes, it's my sermon you're getting
Horizontal spittin', I'm the exorcist of your writtens
Don't interrupt me, nigga, sorry, that's a sin unforgiven
Like how we be skipping on beats like cooking crack in the kitchen
B-b-b-b-b-b-but wait
Just spit the package, dry it, bag up the wet
This mad city's not a game, easy, quiet on set, Phife
(Student of the past trailblazing a daze
Not acknowledging a trend or swept up in a phase
We still the highest of commodity grade
And you could get it, get it, get it, get it today)

Rather watch the Nixon shit than politicians politic
CNN and all this shit

gwaan yo, move with the fuckery
Trump and the SNL hilarity
Troublesome times kid, no times for comedy
Blood clot, you doing, bullshit you spewing
As if this country ain't already ruined

Swearing they're the greatest
Online they debate us, if we different, then we're haters
We ended our hiatus, the dogs looking for food
The nucleus is here now (ooo)

Toleration for devastation, got a hunger for sin
Every nation Obama nation, let the coroner in
Crooked faces, red and blue laces for the color of men
Just embrace it and die alone, song of Revelation
Reverends and cattles racing
Devils and demons and Deuteronomy

He could catch you on his plane or the one you on today
Visit niggas in their dreams
And make them scream of bloody murder
He's a Trini gladiator, ain't no need to take it further
If you wanna take it further your Huckleberry is here

Just forgot to call you back, simple as that
I ain't no almanac, so lick my dictionary
I might just call a cab 'cause I dig canary
Yellow accents on a dark bitch
I met her back when she kept all her carpet
I'm well aware all that shit is fantasy
I double dare y'all to fuck your plan B
That's demeanor, momma's mannerisms
That mean, don't mean to get vulgar, but it's some
Hoes in this bitch like a box of donuts

If life's a obstacle then I'mma bike through it
I see it like a kiddie on the carousel
If I 'url while I go around, what the hell
And that went well, so I'm compelled
To have visions of getting chicken while my friends get jel
My young nigga motto was, ""Fuck it, I'm already grown""
And I dream of when I'm sixteen, I'm out my home
That petty though, 'cause my mama boyfriend dough

The spicy Popeye's and Red Lobster biscuits
And girls scout thin mints
Pardon my penmanship, but oh shit
Feel like I'm hungry now again
And I can't do nothing about it
 
because my teeth are all rotted
And my mom and my pop, they just grin
And empathize with me
 'cause they were little like Pygmies
But too bad they can't get back they 'member whens
Them grown-up stories don't work
In the court of the kiddies', the judgement is in
And while y'all doing all y'all your bids, y'all reminisce as kids
Fuck it, kids, the grown-ups won't own up
They stood on the corner
Like you once upon a, time
And probably felt like a loner
And smelled like a stoner, and snuck to Daytona
So when they questioning you 'bout who or who you ain't boning
Complaining that you always moaning
Never saying good morning
Storming out my house
And slamming doors like you paying bills
They been through it too, though
They were kids like you, though
But what if they knew though
And hit you with the cheat code
To a game you just start playing, no extra man
Leave you reckless on the court
With no high percentage shot
Just a bunch of, ""You got 'em, nigga, just give it what you got""
Yeah, it look a little different on a yacht
But ain't gon' lie, I miss kayaking
I love the young niggas, and they do too, they just be acting
Like a bunch of retired tired thespians, a bit too salty
Shit, their blood pressure high, why?
They don't play no more, probably

Whateva Will Be,We got it from Here... Thank You 4 Your service,2016,"Girl, this motherfucker's got rhythm

Say am I 'posed to be dead or doin' life in prison?
Just another dummy caught up in the system
Unruly hooligan who belongs in Spofford
Verse getting that degree at Stanford or Harvard
Threatened by my work ethic, the way I speak, yo
Should I be mentally weak, verse being Malik? Yo
Should I be trapped in the trap? Would you prefer that?
Fourth grade reading level but he knows how to rap
Are you amused by our struggles? The English that's broken?
The weed that I'm smokin'? The guns that I'm totin'?
The drugs that I'm sellin'? No need for improvement
Fuck you and who you think I should be, forward movement

Melanated shrouded in complexity
Brain charge shocking like 'lectricity
Mouth translate happens organically
The media relates it what it thinks it sees
Judging steps in shoes of a path they never walked
Shot down in a blaze of a phrases is how they talk
Dark skinned, walk with a bot portrayed villain
I'm chillin', felon down to the DNA crime willin'
Subliminate their youth, hyper-sexualize their women
They ain't got the strong enough hold, so they built the prisons
Pumping false religions to all of these niggas' systems
Every voice devoid of the truth
Come on, listen

Man look at this, man look at this
Whatever will be will be
Like a billionaire investin' in a nigga's dreams
Certainly a head scratcher, like Pac and Big's killers' capture
Or a women with the wisdom who's leadin' the way
The rarity is in the rear, but never today
Man, picture a PD lettin' good records play
On the strength of what it is, not the finesse of your biz
And your lady calls you dirty, her dirts under rugs
You'll find out only if she tells you, take her kiss and hug, cuz
In the answer for cancer in a prodigious kid's mind
Yes, the government will fund, learning is free for everyone
And from that lie, young leaders will rise
In the eyes of despair and adversity
In some universe, this verse will be true

Everybody runnin' when they see the storm's comin'
But whatever's gonna be will be
Everybody runnin' when they see the storm's comin'
But whatever's gonna be will be
Some will dash to the mountain, some will crawl
And the weakest amongst them, they will fall
But the strongest in faith, they will stand tall
Everybody runnin' when they see the storm's comin'
But whatever's gonna be will be

I just wanna feel as liberated as lions in Liberia
'Cause recently my heart turned cold as Siberia
'Cause everywhere I go, bein' cold is the criteria
Let's see how well you know all your Tribe trivia
Green and the white, we servin' that Nigeria
North side of Queens, one-nine-two is the area

'Cause L7 squares always making my shit list
Spring is in the air and all the flowers are blooming
The powers that be wanna devour the movement
Tears disappear when they fall on the summer rain
Bleedin' through this mic, but they call it entertainment
Running across stages is a drug
Is like a blunt that we crumble in raw papers
Call it the lord’s name 'cause we taking it in our veins
Like the feeding us intravenous
It’s war and we fighting for inches and millimeters
They try to stall the progress by killing off all the leaders
If we don’t give them martyrs no more, they can’t defeat us
This lack of justice got us disgusted, look at our faces
All these soldiers hate but I saw military training
The false flags fly at a half mast this morning
Take a bow, this might be your last performance

They sold ya, sold ya, sold ya
They sold ya, sold ya, sold ya

The old lady saw us on the lawn with the Henny
Turn the pool party into the one from McKinney
Might've been racist like the waitresses up in Denny’s
Swore we had twelve gauges, automatics, and semis
Now they wanna condemn me for my freedom of speech
'Cause I see things in black and white like Lisa and Screech
Presidents get impeached and others fill in the throne
But veterans don’t get the benefit of feelin' at home
So maybe those projections out at Silicon
Are what drove her to get injections made of silicone
I swear it’s the killing season
'Cause killin' is still in season, yeah

Louder than a three pound, voices screaming mad to boot
It must be killing season, on the menu strangefruit
Whose juices fill the progress of this here very nation
Whose states has grown bitter through justice expiration
These fruitful trees are rooted in bloody soil and torment
Things haven’t really changed
Or they're dormant for the moment
Marks and scars, we own it, only makes for tougher skin
Helps us actualize the actual greatness held within
Been on the wrong team so much, can’t recognize a win
Seems like my only crime is having melanin
Connection to the sun so strong the relationship is lusted for
Causes men to suffocate, I can’t breathe no more
Settle the score sadly, need an abacus to tally
Through all the peaks and valleys, yo, I recognize it sadly
Black soul bold enough, inner city cold enough
Watch me get all my goons, watch us get soldiered up

They sold ya, sold ya, sold ya
They sold ya, sold ya, sold ya
They sold ya, sold ya, sold ya
They sold ya, sold ya, sold ya

And niggas talking through speakers
Fattest laces through my sneakers

Thought I had it so I tried it, for so long I would just hide it
Then I made the crowds say ""Hoo!""
And saw them all get excited
I was hooked, I couldn't shake it
The more I got, I would take it
Couldn't sleep andcouldn't eat
But this life, I would not forsake it

And every brother ain't a brother now (they don't know)

I guess I should take one, just one
So many thoughts in my mind making it very hard to unwind
I guess I should take one, just one
So many thoughts in my mind making it very hard to unwind
I guess I should take one, just one
So many thoughts in my mind making it very hard to unwind

This one I'm taking when I feel sad (just one, yeah)
This one I'm taking to make me strong (just one)
This one I'm taking so that I'll live long (just one, yeah)
This one I'm taking to make me smile (just one)

I'm moving backwards, never that was never the plan
Pushing shit along, render stillness in the quick sand
Asphalt jumpin', junkie lyrical, concrete
My Jedi mind be moving me
Throughout the many dark streets
Backwoods, boondocks, whatever terrain
Auf Wiedersehen, Aloha, man our feet ain't the same
I won't abuse these shoes, these shoes ain't made for reversing
Then trudging through these motherfuckers' first album Footprinting, never ever ghostwritten, yo' shit free, bitten
Grab my shit with both hands, iron grip, steel mitten
Bloviated, Jarobi ate it and now it's gone
Closed mouths don't get fed or move ahead
To my hustlers with customers, scam my chicks just being petty
Trap lords with the fetty, don't be no backwards, no
No backward ass nigga, don't be no backwards, no
No backward ass nigga, don't be no backwards, no
No backward ass nigga, don't be no backwards, no
Don't do it, nigga

I spun around without a care
When I stopped, I felt lost
I'm two heels from the top tier
Really want to be boss
I figured it out, figured it out somewhere
Maybe the answer's not out there
Maybe it's on the ground somewhere
When I stopped, I felt lost
Do you ever feel lost?

They wanna see my downfall
Turn a good day into a downpour
Thorns in the crown hit the cross I bear
Why they wanna see me hangin' like a towel somewhere
One eye, two bills, three tears, a heart still
How I'm feelin' in my mind right here
Think I'm moving, I ain't going nowhere, nowhere
Maybe why I feel lost, yeah
How I'm 'posed to know how home feels?
I ain’t even on my home field
And again I feel lost
Was not a cruise that brought us here, again I feel lost
And I refuse to be stuck right here, yeah
I don't want to move backwards, no
Somebody just give me
Somebody just give me
Somebody just give me direction?
I don't want to move backwards, no
Somebody just give me
Somebody just give me
Somebody just give me directions?
I don't want to move backwards, no

Moving backwards never, that was never the plan
Can I vent? I was content being my own man
Up until that night ill-fated, walking home I was faded
Po puts braces on my wrist like he was clapping his hands
How demeaning, y'all? Who could be blind to racism?
Bring bro bro to me for the brotherly baptism
Instead of slaps, give him the dose of Ab wisdom
He'll make it out of the jungle some way
Hey, it's figurative, not a real place you stay
Ay, it's mind state filled with muck and malaise
Uh, I got direction without using Waze
Submitting myself to praying these days
Yeah, moonwalking backwards, it's only for stage

Feds lining up, in riot gear
And everybody's hands in the air
Four-five so get your ass found somewhere
Caught between hope and despair
Say it loud, what it take to make my niggas listen
Somebody just give me
Somebody just give me
Somebody just give me
Cool out, chill out nigga, I'm cool
Cool out nigga, nah, nigga I'm through
Head down, ain't no tellin' what you gon' do

Somebody just give me—
Somebody just give me direction

Might even take your broad too

Tell mama I'mma slide through)

Enough!!,We got it from Here... Thank You 4 Your service,2016,"Is this enough?
Is this enough?
Is this enough?
Is this enough?
Enough, enough, enough

Yo, I'm savant with the game
Gon' tell Robi yo' name
Provide words that's heard, setting your body aflame
Ooh, you off the chain, I'm handling your terrain
Your valley h-has me standing down to the follicle
'Bout half of this bottle full of reasons for us to ball
Palming violations and travel vacation, ma
Lace your fancy bra, gon' take them vestments off
Skin and my lips involved, I'm licking a place that's soft
Jedi

Is this enough?
Is this enough love that I give to you?
Is this enough?
Is this enough time that I give to you?
Is this enough?
Tell me that you feel the same way I do
Is this enough?
Enough, enough, enough

Is it an issue if I make you nut?
But there's no quality time 'cause I forever grind
This is not an excuse, I just wanna get loose
That's old nigga jargon, girl, you're making me hardened
To a stone or granite statue, I'm prone to get at you
It's hard to break your defense, I guess I have to leap fence
Or scale wall, and break fall on a tree right by your window
Reward me for my efforts by rolling this indo
As I nibble your neck naughtily, sex is a big part of me
Agencies want to audit me, searching, snooping for sodomy
My thrust bust artery, I know you're on to me
Just wanna have shenanigan
Don't wanna make you mad again
So focus on the flattery you feel when I fling it
Acknowledge that I got it and you love it when I bring it
Dirty talk loud but they saying, ""Fuck the shit out of me""
At the Queen's request, if it's gotta be, it's gotta be

Is this enough?
Is this enough love that I give to you?
Is this enough?
Is this enough time that I give to you?
Is this enough?
Tell me that you feel the same way I do

Is this enough love that I give to you?

Mobius,We got it from Here... Thank You 4 Your service,2016,"I break bread, ribs, hundred dollar bills
Dream about Bugattis and other four-wheels
They say Illuminati and other ordeals
Is how my lawyer got me to avoid a raw deal
And now it's more real than it is for any other star
And that's enough to have you tearing up the mini-bar
I should probably get awards where the Emmys are
For how I deal with the pap like Remy Ma
I get in the car like a sniper's on the roof now
But don't confuse how you see me have to move now
I got bars like a cypher's in the booth now
Ooh, child, things are gonna get easier
'Long as they get my page right on Wikipedia
'Long as they say my name right in the media
If you don't, that's a sin like Cincinnati
'Cause ever since I had the polo suit at the Grammys
I been spittin' at the camera like Trick Daddy
So swaggy, he could've broke up with IG
I ain't surprised that they broke up on IG
I got the game on IV, might as well have a live feed
Keep a fresh cut from IB
So I always match the picture in my ID
They packin' Dub C had ran with Mack 10
I was still a baby Similac then
And what the crack era did to black men
It had to be an error if you had a Cadillac then

How I rock mine, I throw it up
Makin' sure that you niggas all are on the same page
Powerful force, you better look both ways
Fuck that, I'm chokin' niggas, it's goin' down
I'm from a different cloth, we the oracles of the sounds
Skip town, hit 'em with impeccable pound
Lost, found, the way I flood it, niggas gon' drown
Rip shit—
ayo, wait, wait, wait, wait—
I gotta do it again, I gotta do it again
You already know the script, roundhouse kick
She lookin' at me, lickin' her lip
Put my arm around her like a bowl of chip with a dip
With yo' bitch, what the fuck, niggas erupt
I got the half moon clip, that's banana
A good planner, 
a new anger like a larger Bruce Banner
Out the house, nigga, if you open your mouth
Man, nigga, if you open your mouth
Fuck the press, 
I'm leavin' every room in a mess
Like herds of bulls
 with they aprons on and bakin' soda
Keep it movin', keep the convo short
And bring a case of Henney (case of Henney)
House of pain, I control many (control many)
House of lies, you niggas go run, hide
Peep the way this vibe conflict with they real lives
(Nigga) Fanatic shit, we go bizarre (we go bizarre)
Bad news for niggas as I go emphatical, radical
National animal rulin' like a czar
Every time I black for the record, the shit splatter
The whole batter, no bullshit, the boom bapper
I pull the gat up, whip the shit, cook the batter
When I pull up on niggas, even your momma gon' scatter

And don’t be taking slack from these non-rapping niggas, man
That intellectual shit you spit, you better change your plan
Especially when you see 'em at the lobby of a label
And they don’t seem able to outstretch they hands
And admit they fans
You better flame 'em in the J's that they standing in
Ostracize they memory for not remembering
The articles reduce their body parts to particles
And dust the Dead Sea with their cremated molecules
I’m leaving, but nigga you still got the work to do
I expect the best from you, I’m watching from my heaven view
Don’t disappoint me, make sure that they anoint me
As the blue ribbon pedigree, the best of show, five-foot-three
Speak of the legacy for short people around the world
Napoleonic, bionic people who cause the world to twirl
Rip every stage with grace, look right dead in they face
Live the Tribe principle of havin' impeccable taste
Enjoy that breath like that one was your last one left
If you don’t believe me, Tip, there’s truly life after death
So refer to the Biggie covers and shoutout my Trini brothers
And please check in on my mother...

Lost Somebody,We got it from Here... Thank You 4 Your service,2016,"Yeah, Phife—for your life

Now, in the time when niggas wasn’t supposed to be born
Best of us are left for dead in cities that looks war-torn
Vietnam going wrong, heroin going strong
Neighbors would whoop that bad ass
Just for running through their lawn
Walt met Cheryl, Cheryl met Walt
Trinidadian love sprouting through the asphalt
Love was consummated and the angels registrated
Two were to be born but only one of 'em made it
Inside a cloud of sorrow, a silver lining and joy
It’s a bouncing baby boy, a king’s name they would employ
And before he even squeaks, it’s decided it’s Malik
Now give him hope, give him care
Raise him while his grandma there
Watch out momma, if you stare
Light brown eyes'll keep you there
Let’s progress the story just a little bit
Malik, I would treat you like little brother that would give you fits
Sometimes overbearing
 
though I thought it was for your benefit
Despite all the spats and shits cinematically documented
The one thing I appreciate, you and I, we never pretended
Rhymes we would write it out, hard times fight it out
Gave grace face to face, made it right
And now you riding out, out, out, out, damn

Have you ever loved somebody?
(Phife dawg, man)
Way before you got to dream?
(Bow wow, woof woof)
No more crying, he’s in sunshine

Never thought that I would be ever writing this song
Hold friends tight, never know when those people are gone
So, so beautiful, opined indisputable
Heart of a largest lion trapped inside the little dude
Took me quick to granny house, now we eat the curry food
Talking hopes, dreams, plans, leak ice, never scared
Brand new pair of Nike Airs, avenue of sairs
Mailbox mayors, all our rhymes was written there
A nigga wanna battle, you know Phifey didn’t care
Jarobi with the beat, into new ass we tear
I’mma flash forward well, 
took a trip to ATL
Cooking in the kitchen making sure my nigga eating well
Wedding in Tobago, you know exactly where I’m at
Standing on the side of black Malik Izaak

Have you ever loved somebody?
Way before you got to dream?
No more crying, he’s in sunshine
He’s alright now, see his wings
Have you ever loved somebody?
Way before you got to dream?
No more crying, he’s in sunshine
He’s alright now, see his wings

Ego,We got it from Here... Thank You 4 Your service,2016,"Ego, ego skippin', trippin' in my mind
Ego, ego skippin', trippin' in my mind
Ego, ego trippin', trippin', trippin', trippin', trippin'
Ego, ego
I got one, you got one, and now we equal
Sometimes it makes you trip out on your people
Sometimes it has connotations of evil
Sometimes niggas call on it when they need to
It's called the ego

Ay, it's hard to really make the subject positively stated
Some may hate it and some may overrate it
It's a top story and you rarely see a trend
So all you psychoanalysts, pull out your pad and pen
It's called the ego
Come up with an idea, and no one seems to get it
Then every time you mention it
They stare like you're two-headed
But one day, in your cubicle, your idea really comes to view
Your boss is walking by, he sees it too and he takes it from you
She put you on the aces of all the stripper places
And has the kinda clientele where niggas trick off very well
You beg her and you plead her and you tuck away your ego
She knows you need the chicken
And you know that she's your people
They call you fat and lazy, your commentary crazy
They photoshop your face on a box of McCormick gravy
And now that inner voice, that ego, making you get wavy
Change your diet, hit the gym
And say, ""What were you saying to me?""
The ego makes you do it, it makes you face the music
Or run away from life so fast that you'll outsprint Carl Lewis
It has you think your deceptive ways of being are the truest
Had the prettiest brown eyes but you change them shits to the bluest
It's the ego

Ooo, Jack White
Ooo, Jack White

A celebrated genius, my dick game is the meanest
I'll take the girl that's augmented, new me is invented
I'll take the biggest house in Calabassas
Anyone for Michael Phelps swimming classes?
You need it when you're balling, equally when you're falling
Or when those kids in school on your locker
They get to scrawling
Epithets that's racist is stupid and mean in nature
Something that can make you feel stronger when people hate ya
Ego make you violent or govern like a tyrant
Or switch a dictionary's word from vibrant to vivrant
Fool the thirsty people, selling tap water in bottles
Fooled a girl with NYU scholarship and now she models
Ego has no ending, has people pretending
Religious zealots get jealous 'cause guys want their defending
This is the last Tribe and our ego hopes that you felt us
And closing for our ego, we know only God can help us

Ego, ego skippin', trippin' in my mind
Ego, ego skippin', trippin' in my mind
Ego, ego trippin', trippin', trippin', trippin', trippin'
Ego, ego skippin', trippin' in my mind

Q-Tip’s Announcement Letter,UnKnown,2016,"10•27‌•2016
TO ALL THE GOOD PEOPLE WORLDWIDE!
We hope this letter finds you & yours safe and without a scratch!
Last year this time myself, Jarobi, Ali and PHIFE had the extreme pleasure of performing on the Tonight Show©. It was our 1st T.V. performance in 18 yrs
The energy for us that night was one that we hadn't experienced on stage together in some time!
It was also the night of the
PARIS BOMBING....
November 13th...Friday...
A unseasonably warm night in NYC...
As we left 30 ROCK I felt the need, we all did, to get back to the Studio and start that Cookup!!
SO WE GOT TO IT
It was coming together nicely and as you may know we lost our BROTHER may GOD REST HIS SOUL on March 22nd
But he left us with the BluePrint of what we had to do
So collected ourselves and along tribesman, BUSTA and CONS...we completed what will be, obviously the final
A TRIBE CALLED QUEST ALBUM!
No this isn't filled with old Phife Bars.. This is that Pure, unstepped on Pure!!
And on November 11th, 2016
We will complete our Paths of Rhythm.. Join Us!!
PEACE!! Q-Tip

Somebody just give me
Somebody just give me direction?
I don't want to move backwards, no

A-fixed to the Earth like my feet, they got cleats on
I'm moving backwards, never that was never the plan
Pushing shit along, render stillness in the quick sand)

Somebody just give me
Somebody just give me
Somebody just give me direction?

When I stopped, I felt lost
I'm two heels from the top tier
Really want to be boss
I figured it out, figured it out somewhere
Maybe the answer's not out there
Maybe it's on the ground somewhere, yeah yeah
I don't want to move backwards, no
I can't go back in

Somebody just give me
Somebody just give me direction)
Can't listen in, hey
I don't want to move backwards, no

Hey yo Consequence

I just want to thank President Agent Orange
(What up Cheeto?)
For perpetuating all of the evil that you've been perpetuating throughout the United States
(Wall)
I want to thank President Agent Orange for his successful attempt at the Muslim ban
When we come together
We the people
(Let's go)

We don't believe you 'cause we the people
Are still here in the rear, ayo, we don't need you
You in the killing-off-good-young-brother mood
When we get hungry we eat the same  food
The ramen noodle
Your simple voodoo is so maniacal, we're liable to pull a juju
The irony is that this bad bitch in my lap
She don't love me, she make money, she don't study that
She gon' give it to me, ain't gon' tell me run it back
She gon' take the brain to wetter plains, she spit on that
The doors have signs with, don't try to rhyme with
VH1 has a show that you can waste your time with
Guilty pleasures take the edge off reality
And for a salary I'd probably do that shit sporadically
The OG Gucci boots are smitten with iguanas
The IRS piranha see a brother gettin' commas
Brothers in my hood living in a fishbowl
Gentrify here, so it's not no hole
Trendsetter, ayo, I know it's cold
Top 5 yo if I could be so bold
But now you

All of the bad folks, you must go
(Dark-skinned, hi hello, you've gots to go)
All of my poor folks, you must go
And all of them Mexicans, you must go
(Don't forget about the Chinese and Filipinos)
Muslims and gays
(You've gots to go)
Boy, we hate your ways
(Just go away)
All of our rap folk you must go

Phife Dawg!

The fog and the smog of news media that logs
False narratives of Gods that came up against the odds
We're not just nigga rappers with the bars
It's kismet that we're cosmic with the stars
You bastards overlooking street art
Better yet, street smarts but you keep us off the charts
Who can come back years later, still hit the shot?
Still them tryna move we off the - block

Babylon, bloodclaat
Two pon yuh headtop

All of my black folks, you must go
(Dark-skinned, hi hello, you've gots to go)
All of my poor folks, you must go
(Still hustling every day and )
And all of ya Mexicans, you must go

The smell would just linger, I suppose
You assume that my words are faulty
Doubting with the stance that I take
It's not my fault that most of the dudes
That you used to mess with turned away
Shorty, you can't be all of that
If you could just let me be the one
There is no other dog like the Phife Dawg
At least not on this side of sun
If you don't want to, please let me know
And I'll kindly proceed to bounce but
Maybe if I can say so myself
I know that you've been checking me out

Watching me and you walk, baby grins
'You know them cats?' ""Nah. Who they is?""
Ebonically, you runnin' off at the jibbs
Got to my house, checked the messages
Some cat talkin' 'bout (ya didn't know)
Now is this what is meant to be
When we try to live more comfortably?
 (come on)
Making these advances all in vain
It seems that you don't recognize the name
All I really wanted was making you mine
Addition to my world so we could shine
Why didn't you tell me you had some plans?
Why didn't you tell me you had a man?
Why didn't you tell me you had a man?
Why didn't you tell me you had a man?
Had a man, had some plans
Had a man, had some plans...",https://genius.com/A-tribe-called-quest-waiting-on-you-lyrics

Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, just get on the dance floor and be alright

ATM plans and a cell phone jack
When y'all jokers snap, my mic got LoJack
'Cause I've been getting chips since John and Ponch-o
Keep your mouth closed and come on up out yours
I shot the sheriff, that makes me outlaw
Give me everything, withdraw up out yours
'Cause I got fam to feed, chicks that need weaves
Tore up in the hood tryna P.I.M.P
When you in the midst of a robbery
What's the procedure? Here's the procedure
I'm soon to be one up in a million like Aaliyah

You're like the Outlaw Josey Wales with steel in your ribs
I advise you do what we say and that's it
Like Butch Cassidy, I make all the sons dance
And on the stagecoach, I keep the dimes in trance
I'm riding off in the sun with pockets lumped out
Leave the town verbin' with jewels and love about
Who be the black cat cat with the intelligence
Make it a civilized poke, regain sense
It's me, Jimmy Cliff, harder they come, they fall out
The stressed out stranger rearrange your ball out
I'm getting target practice with the sure shot aims
Run you on the dance floor with my Jesse James
So click clack, it's like that
Click clack, The Abstract
Click clack, the Consequence
We coming through, and we making you tense

Making lakes in your jersey, like Jerome Kersey
Jealous and you're thirsty, cut open a cactus
You scared to soar to new heights like B.A. Baracus
I'm wild for the night, you's a daytime actress
192, we been rebels, hold you captive
Regis and Kathy never seen this live host
Upholding space jams, hitting hang 'em high notes
Catch me pushing more Cherokees than Walter Oates
Folks on the check in
Bills get passed and Billy Razor gets elected
Now who defected?
Broke camp and switched stations, Queens the foundation...",https://genius.com/A-tribe-called-quest-get-it-up-lyrics
Georgie Porgie,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Listen up money or should I say honey
Listen up money or should I say honey

In the beginning there was Adam and Eve
But some try to make it look like Adam and Steve
Like Georgie, why can't money find a honey
I couldn't believe when I found out he was funny
You know fierce with just his right ear pierced
I couldn't hack it, I knew this brother for years
Walking in the ville with them long dreadlocks
But on the DL, getting done up the butt box
Oh my God how gross can one be
Well anyway, better him than me
Used to be down with the crew and had the girls that were def
Instead of staying to the right, he fell off to the left
So Lord J being that you go next
Pull the rest of his card cause I'm vexed

My man George got a germ that's ill
Suffering from terminal scag
But never ever getting caught walking like a fag
That's not his bag cause the plague was afraid to parade in drag
So instead he played the DL
, brothers get jel
Cause honey's on his dick but money won't swell
He'd rather call Manuel for a little duel
Have a swordfight with tools
He's wounded and I can't understand
Why a man would want to be a weak cipher man
I thought the plan was to be hard as a rock
Not riding a jock, sucking on a cock


My man George I thought he was on base
Find out later that he was a closet case
Woah woah he's a sweet thing
George was down with the titty titty bang bang
Now George swung with gays, just the way he sways
Even fooled around with his mom's lingerie
Come get it girl, something fierce was his line
Even wore a dress and on his face he had swine
He cipher monkey cipher
, you fucking faggot
Couldn't wait for gay parade so you can drag it
George used to flip, went from hitting skins to sucking nigga's dick
George better get a grip

Now Georgie used to run with the ill brothers
Kids who liked to rob mothers, and do a bunch of crazy things
He had the ladies, a baby, a shiny black .380
That he always kept tucked and filled with the slugs
Now watch how money bugs
Weight fell it's hard to tell but believe me George has slid
Coming out the closet was the dress that he hid
From the boys when we was over there I seen it out the corner of my eye
I said damn Georgie George signify
The whole crew seen it now the whole block knows
That George gets his kicks from wearing Wisdom's clothes

Now Georgie Porgie pudding pie
What made you choose the path of the gays, oh why
Ain't got no reason, to hell with alibis
Won't play basketball cause your nails ain't dry
Call me homophobic but I know it and you know it
You're filthy and funny to the utmost exponent
Never will I do that, disrespect my mommy
So run and hide your salami
Used to, didn't you, used to be my man
Instead of shaking, you're dragging your hand
Yes it's the Abstract the info provider
Here's your new name - the rump rider",https://genius.com/A-tribe-called-quest-georgie-porgie-lyrics
Scenario (Demo 2),UnKnown,UnKnown,"Good mornin', good mornin'
It's about 10 o'clock and I'm just yawnin'
I throw on my gear and the cologne called Stetson
Grab my dough and I'm out like George Jetson
It's a lovely day and I'm geared to go
We have work to do. so I head to the studio
Everything is fine, and everything is cool
We're doing a jam with the Leaders of the New School
Thinking to myself 'this is gonna be rough'
There's about 8 of us, and 8 is enough
Milo, Busta Rhymes, Dinco D, Charlie B
Q-Tip, Jarobi and my man Ali
Writin' rhyme after rhyme and then start to flow
But yo, Charlie B (AAH), what's the scenario?

I know the scenario
Chap, I rap, superierio
How now brown cow with A Tribe Called Quest
The Leaders of the New School, the LONS, the LONS
Kick the beat, like Peter Pumpernickel
After the lab, I'll go fix me a pickle
Watch the boob tube, and gimme some space
The girlfriend shares and the girlies' underwears
Make me think of all the zones, AAAH, 
From radio to the video to Arsenio, tell me, yo
Yo, what's the scenario

Two to the three to the four to the skip
Jarobi, Jarobi on the LONS tip
Don't like the pig and I don't like hog
After the show get a squalid dog
Don't grovel like a groupie, by the ill hooptie
Bang it, bang it, that's what suits me
We roll blunts and so, so what? I don't want no flabby butt
FEMININE FATT, FEMININE FATT
Yeah, yeah G, all that
Smoke the hootie mack like a goddamn pro
Yo, yo, G, what's the scenario?

Here we go yo, here we go yo
So what's, so what's, so what's the scenario?
Here we go yo, here we go yo
So what's, so what's, so what's the scenario?

Oh oh
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, hey yo, hey yo
Feel the tricks and the mystic of the flow
Thick like the pie of an onion yuppie
Jarobi got a dog but I got a squalid puppy
The Rumple Busta Rhymes, no need to be braggin'
Loud like a roar from a dungeon dragon
If your tush is small, miss, you're zero
And if your butt cheeks are thick, show me your hero
Who are we? Leaders Leaders of the New School
With an alliance with the Tribe so clean up the jewel
So go suck a lemon, set off the inferno
You're left in suspense, so what's next on the scenario?

What's the scenario as the wind (BLOWS)?
Yo, attention span short so don't (IGNORE)
Hey yo, hey yo
As the door opens, the plot just thickens
Speed agility, that shit quickens
Tip is sticking, sticks to stones
Stones to bones, I got a Jones
As microphones are in my dreams
It swallows me and then I scream
Ooh! Hot damn, I'm swift
Yo and see the top man to get the top spliff
Sit down, ignite with Miss Mary 
Yo Mary, yo what's up for tonight?

Hey yo, scenario, what does it mean?
Ding dong, the beat has Kong so we must be Kings
Not because we're dirty, not because we clean
But we kiss girls with the big butt jeans
(Meaty bone, meaty bone) One for all
(Meaty bone, meaty bone) Can ya hear the call?
'Cause rings around the rosie with a big fat if
The Tribe brought a vibe then we spark some spit
The spit started sparkin', sound sounded super
Should such a scenario be reserved for the future?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
That's the idea, now what do you hear?


The second go round it's the Phife from Quest
The one who like the brown skinned girlies with the nice round breasts
You know the rest, oh yes? (Oh yes)
Oh yes, I won't dare stop until my better is best
I'm known for maxin' or relaxin', or just chillin' hard
Find me on Sayers Ave. or Linden Boulevard
Wake up in the morning and I eat the wheat Chex
 sex, that's when I get 
vexed
Step inside the crib with a 6 pack of Beck's
Or just pass the EZ Wider before I break your neck

Checka one, checka two, checka three, CHECKA FOUR
Mr. Muhammad, give it up some more
AYE AYE AYE, that's how it flows
Soon to boom is Pinocchio
A Future Without A Past
Strong Island is where I took class
A high pitch for the skins one to ten
Charles in Charge, here we go again
Seminars are whack, look at the panel
Same brown time, same brown channel
 is phenomenal, yo, AH, AH, AH, what's the scenario?

Heyo, pimpin' pumps is real easy
Specially when the ho is real greasy
Don't riff with the raff but the real thing
Don't stutter step but I will sing
Step to ya like a poker poker chip
Now you're off on the mystic MYSTIC
Come on, cutie pie, gimme a sugar hit
Now you wanna be my honey dip
Step to the mic with an ill grin
Countin' six hairs on my chinny chin chin
Mystic man with the ill flow - Busta, bust a scenario

Scenario (Demo 1),UnKnown,UnKnown,"Yo
Good mornin', good mornin'
Hey yo Bo knows this, and Bo knows that
But Bo don't know jack 'cause Bo can't rap
I use nouns, adjectives, pronouns, verbs
Smoke ya like herb if your style is to the curb
Making more hits than Sonny and Cher
Stop, look, and listen but please don't stare
Slammin' emcees as if my name was Ric Flair
But since I'm dark, call me Koko B. Ware

Yo, I know the scenario
Chaps, I rap, superierieo
How now brown cow with A Tribe Called Quest
The Leaders of the New School, the LONS, the LONS
Kick the beat, like Peter Pumpernickel

Make me sick of all the , AAAH, 
From radio to the video to Arsenio, tell me, yo
What's the scenario

Ichabod cat got nothin' on a ?
I got headphones to match 
Stop kick more when I tour as is
Plugs is connect as oral sex come correct
I got checks bigger than bigger than Busta's blunt
I don't go on the frees but I just tease on the ease of a tick tick tack tock
I got lickety  but I won't smear
So someone Plug One on my vibe
As I muscle much dollars, gripping much cheese
Keep it undercover like a yellow submarine

Yo
You got the B.I., then you add the zero
Chop the track, yo, scenari-ario
Funk the flow, ho, you never know
Will I got off the 'locks or will I let them grow?
Show to show, ho to ho
Booties is bangin' 'cause I'm the pro
Mash up the track then I start to flow
Pass it on 'cause here I go

The Black Sheep has arisen, oh dear
The cat's out the bag and that's the end of your career
Don't spit it out, take it to the rear
I like to see my dick snot disappear
Some say they get live but the Sugar Dick is liver
In and out of any situation like MacGyver
If it's not Bo Peep, then it's Lady Godiva's
When it comes to getting ass, I'm a striver
Give me ten hoes to bone and there won't be no survivor
Peace from the nine point fiver

Hey yo, oh my gosh, oh my gosh
Eating Ital stew like the one Peter Tosh
Uh, uh uh, all over the track
Uh, pardon me, uh, as I come back
As I did it, yo, I had to beg your pardon
When I travel through the town I roll with the squadron
Raow, raow, like a dungeon dragon
Change your little drawers 'cause your pants are saggin'
Try to step to this, I will twist you in a turban
And have you smelling rank like some old, stale urine
Chickity Choco, the chocolate chicken
The rear cock diesel, butt cheeks they were kicking
Yo, bust it out before the Busta bust another rhyme
Rhythm in sync, the rhymes are on time
Yo ripping up the sound like Horatio
Observe the vibe and check out the scenario

True blue, Scooby Doo, whoopie doo
Scenarios, radios, rates more than two
Scores for the smores that smother dance floors
Now I go for mine, shades of sea shore
Ship-shape crushed grapes apes that play tapes
Papes make drakes baked for the wakes
Of an L-ah-, an -eader, simply just a leader
Base in the space means peace, see ya later

Here we go, yo; here we go, yo
So what's, so what's, so what's the scenario?

1996 Rap City Freestyle,UnKnown,UnKnown,"...-Like that, It's like this
When you hear the nigga yo he be in a bliss
'Cause I make the rhymes and it's just a easy gist
With a twist, of my nouns and my verbs
Consummated, into a sentence, ease of words
That I'm at (hmm), so amazin', when I'm blazin'
Just like a trip to Portland, Trail Blazer
But yo listen, yo I gotta say it like this
I got the Phife Dawg and he wants to assist
To persist (yeah) with the rhythm (yeah)
Give 'em (yeah) what you got (yeah)
Phife Dawg hop (check it out) off the mic (check it out) and make the joint hot

Malik Izaak Taylor is the illest rhyme creator
Let me be the first to say; that I be's a player hater
'Cause I hate when emcees play on this device known as a mic
Then have the nerve to even think that their rhymes and they're tight
So I laugh, quietly watching how the industry's bust
All these video sluts, and guys who front like they're tough
All these million-selling rappers with the bogus-like husks
Withew brothers screaming ""Brooklyn!"", when they're probably from Lynbrook
And oh, I see hood raps putting 40's to their lips and head
Go out buy a chalice, and they wanna be a dread, oh my head
Someone pass the buffering, I'm sufferin'
Too many heads out here, word is born, they just frontin'!
I'm stayin' true, making sure my game's legit, no time for ass and getting caught up in that glitzy
Without my peeps I don't know how the hell I'd make it
But just by having them around lets me know I won't fake it
So big up big up!
Because you emcees ain't ready
Peace to Allen Iverson, my man Stephon Marbury up in, the NBA
And I'm gonna be writin' for the magazine soon
Check me out, boom!
I'm out!
