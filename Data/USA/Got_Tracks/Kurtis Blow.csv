Basketball,Ego Trip,1984.0,"They're playing basketball
We love that basketball
They're playing basketball
We love that basketball

(Now rapping basketball -- Number 1, Kurtis Blow)
Basketball is my favorite sport
I like the way they dribble up and down the court
Just like I'm the king on the microphone
So is Dr. J and Moses Malone
I like slam dunks, take me to the hoop
My favorite play is the alley-oop
I like the pick-and-roll, I like the give-and-go
'Cause it's basketball, uh, Mister Kurtis Blow

They're playing basketball
We love that basketball
They're playing basketball
We love that basketball

I used to go to dinner, then take the girl
To see Tiny play against Earl The Pearl
And Wilt, Big O, and Jerry West
Play basketball at it's very best
Basketball has always been my thing
I like Magic
, 
Bird
, and 
Bernard King
And number 33, my man Kareem
Is the center on my starting team
(To the hoop, y'all, watch out, watch out
In yo' face, now here comes the rest)

Clyde
, Rick Barry, 
and Pistol Pete
Now these players could never be beat
Isiah
, and 
Iceman
 too
Just give 'em the ball, and then you chalk up two
Dantley and Wilkins are on the scene
And Ralph Sampson is really mean
Bill Russell didn't take no junk
And Darryl Dawkins got a monster dunk

Tell me, were you in the joint
The night Wilt scored 100 points?
Or when Celtics won titles back-to-back
And didn't give nobody no kind of slack?
Or when Dr. J shook the whole damn team
With moves that came right out of a dream?
Or when Willis Reed stood so tall
Playing D with desire? It's basketball!

They're playing basketball
We love that basketball
They're playing basketball
We love that basketball

I get the ball and then I go and play
Like a superstar in the NBA
The forwards, the centers, and all the guards
The ones you see on the bubblegum cards
Me and homeboy would go one-on-one
'Cause playing the game is a lot of fun
Sit by the TV and watch 'em all
'Cause Kurtis Blow is rapping basketball",https://genius.com/Kurtis-blow-basketball-lyrics
The Breaks,Kurtis Blow,1980,"Clap your hands everybody
If you got what it takes
'Cause I'm Kurtis Blow and I want you to know
That these are the breaks

Brakes on a bus, brakes on a car
Breaks to make you a superstar
Breaks to win and breaks to lose
But these here breaks will rock your shoes
And these are the breaks
Break it up, break it up, break it up!

If your woman steps out with another man
(That's the breaks, that's the breaks!)
And she runs off with him to Japan
(That's the breaks, that's the breaks!)
And the IRS says they want to chat
(That's the breaks, that's the breaks!)
And you can't explain why you claimed your cat
(That's the breaks, that's the breaks!)
And Ma Bell sends you a whopping bill
(That's the breaks, that's the breaks!)
With 18 phone calls to Brazil
(That's the breaks, that's the breaks!)
And you borrowed money from the mob
(That's the breaks, that's the breaks!)
And yesterday you lost your job
(That's the breaks, that's the breaks!)
Well, these are the breaks
Break it up, break it up, break it up

Throw your hands up in the sky
And wave 'em round from side to side
And if you deserve a break tonight
Somebody say alright!
 (All right)
Say ho-oo! (Ho-oo!)
You don't stop
Keep on, somebody scream! (Owwwww!)
Break down!

Breaks on a stage,
 
breaks on a screen
Breaks to make your wallet lean
Breaks run cold and breaks run hot
Some folks got 'em and some have not
But these are the breaks
Break it up, break it up, break it up
Break down!

To the girl in brown, stop messing around
(Break it up, break it up!)
To the guy in blue, whatcha gonna do?
(Break it up, break it up!)
And to the girl in green, don't be so mean
(Break it up, break it up!)
And the guy in red, say what I said
(Break it up, break it up!)
Break down!

Brakes on a plane,
 brakes on a train
Breaks to make you go insane
Breaks in love, breaks in war
But we got the breaks to get you on the floor
And these are the breaks
Break it up, break it up, break it up
Break down! Yo!

Just do it, just do it, just do it, do it, do it!
Just do it, just do it, just do it, do it, do it!
Just do it, just do it, just do it, do it, do it!
Just do it, just do it, just do it, do it, do it!

You say last week you met the perfect guy
(That's the breaks, that's the breaks!)
And he promised you the stars in the sky
(That's the breaks, that's the breaks!)
He said his Cadillac was gold
(That's the breaks, that's the breaks!)
But he didn't say it was 10 years old
(That's the breaks, that's the breaks!)
He took you out to the Red Coach grill
(That's the breaks, that's the breaks!)
But he forgot the cash and you paid the bill
(That's the breaks, that's the breaks!)
And he told you the story of his life
(That's the breaks, that's the breaks!)
But he forgot the part about...his wife! Huh! Huh!
(That's the breaks, that's the breaks!)
Well, these are the breaks!
Break it up, break it up, break it up!
Break down!",https://genius.com/Kurtis-blow-the-breaks-lyrics
Christmas Rappin’,The Best of Kurtis Blow,1979.0,"'Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the house
Hold it now! Wait, hold it. That's played out. Hit it!

Don't you give me all that jive about things you wrote before I's alive
'Cause this ain't 1823 -- ain't even 1970
Now I'm the guy named Kurtis Blow and Christmas is one thing I know
So every year just about this time, I celebrate it with a rhyme
Gonna shake it, gonna bake it, gonna make it good
Gonna rock shock clock it through your neighbourhood
Gonna read, gonna sing it till it's understood
My rappin' bout to happen like a knee you've been slapping
Or a toe you've been tapping on a hunk of wood
Bout a red-suited dude with a friendly attitude
And a sleigh full of goodies for for the people on the block
Got a long white beard, maybe looks kind a weird
And if you ever see him, he could give you quite a shock
Now people let me tell ya bout last year
When the dude came flying over here
Well, the hog was out, snow's on the ground
Folks stayed in to party down
The beat was thumping on the box, and I was dancing in my socks
And the drummer played at a solid pace
And a taste of the bass was in my face
And the guitar player layed down a heavy layer
Of the funky junky rhythm of the disco beat
And the guy with the 88's started to participate
And I could sure appreciate a sound so sweet
We were all in the mood so we had a little food
And a joke, and a smoke, and a little bit of wine
When I thought I heard a hoof on the top of the roof
Could it be or was it me? I was feeling super fine
So I went to the attic where I thought heard the static
On the chance that the prance was somebody breaking in
But the noise on the top was a reindeer clop
Just a trick St. Nick, and I let the sucker in
He was rolly, he was poly, and I said, ""Holy moly!
You got a lot of whiskers on your chinny chin chin""
He allowed he was proud of the hairy little crowd
On the point of his jaw where the skin should've been
Gets cool for a fool going out every Yule
For a day on a sleigh when the cold went low
So the beard may be weird but I'll never have it sheared
Cause it's warm in the storm when it's ten below
I said, ""You're right, it's cold tonight
But can you stop for a drop before you go?""
He said, ""Why not if the music's hot?
And I'll chance a dance beneath the mistletoe""
So he went downstairs and forgot his cares
And he rocked the spot and danced like a pro
And every young girl tried to rock his world
But he boogie oogie oogied til he had to go
And before he went, this fine old gent
Brought a gift with a sift through his big red bags
In the top or the bottom, he reached in and got 'em
Toys for the boys, for the girls glad rags
And the grownups got some presents too
A new TV and a stereo
A new Seville 'bout as blue as the sky
The best that money couldn't buy
'Cause money could never ever buy the feeling
The one that comes from not concealing
The way you you feel about your friends
And this is how the story ends
The dude in red's back at the Pole
Up north where everything is cold
But if he were right here tonight
He'd say, Merry Christmas and to all a good night",https://genius.com/Kurtis-blow-christmas-rappin-lyrics
If I Ruled The World,America,1985.0,"If I ruled the world
I'd love all the girls
Wear diamonds and pearls
If I ruled the world

If I ruled the world, was king on the throne
I'd make peace in every culture, build the homeless a home
I'm not running for Congress or the President
I'm just here, to tell the world, how my story went
You see - first it was a dream, I was living in Rome
And then I moved to London, bought a brand new home
And everywhere I went, I drew lots of attention
Like a stretch limousine, one of those new inventions
It took a few years 'fore the day had come
But I was ruler of the world ranked #1
So I headed towards Washington to claim the crown
Let the whole world know that the King was in town
As I arrived the crowd started to cheer
And then someone yelled out, ""The King is here!""
So I headed toward stage to make a speech
About the new style of living I was gonna teach, uh-huh

If I ruled the world (huh huh, huh huh huh)
I'd love all the girls  (I'd love em love em baby!)
Wear diamonds and pearls
If I ruled the world

People started flowing as they reached for my hand
I said, ""Thank you for bringing me to the Promised Land
But now I must go, so goodbye to everybody
Tonight I'll see you all at my Super Dinner Party""
And late that night, at my Super Dinner Party
I was dancing to the beat and entertaining: ""La-Di-Da-Di""
The music started ending, it was time for a speech
The crowd started sitting as I rose from my feet
And this was once a dream; I explained to the crowd
But now, I rule the world, and I feel, so very proud
Excuse me please for stopping this show
I just had to thank you all, huh, and me so
My first day in office, the King on the throne
I spent my first three hours on the telephone
You know with newsmen reporters, and voters too
I had so many calls, I didn't know what to do
You know hours passed I continued to work
I signed so many papers, my fingers started to hurt
Then I shook off the pain, say this ain't no thing
'Cause there's nothing in the world like being #1 king!

If I ruled the world (huh huh, huh huh huh)
I'd love all the girls  (I'd love em love em baby!)
Wear diamonds and pearls (oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
If I ruled the world (whoa whoa yeahhhhh)
{AJ Scratch cuts up the track for a bit}

Now I rule the world and now, I'm on top
And I'm rolling with folks that could never be stopped
And I'm here to let you know this is where I belong
And to you sucker MC's that sing my song
And it's a song that's strong about right and wrong
And I'ma rock it to you baby baby all night long
And it's a song about love and happiness
In a world of peace and you know that's fresh
Now I'm the king and I want you to know
That I'm the Master Blaster Rapper who's running the show
And to all of you rappers in every country
You better stop what you're doing and listen to me
'Cause we gotta stop war and use unity
To fight crime and hunger and poverty
'Cause the African baby is dying overseas
While you sucker mission politicians busting out Z's
Huh, 20 million people all unemployed
While the rich man try to play Pretty Boy Floyd
While the working class just struggles hard
Try to make ends meet against all odds
While the poor man can't even deal with life
You know he tried to escape, and smoked the coke on the pipe
And it's time for a CHANGE, to a better way
'Cause the sun has GOTTA shine through the cloudy day
So LISTEN UP world while I teach this class
And take heed to the message or we ain't gonna last
'Cause I know, the solution, is the contribution
Of woman and man to just join the revolution
That'll take your brain to a higher plane
And help you deal in a world that's gone insane
With the problems that I know we can stop
From the ruler of the world and the man on top
But the years went by, and time was up
And then the ruler of the world had ran out of luck
And all the people at the time who said they were my friends
Didn't know me when my job had come to an end
The King who took my place was happy as can be
He was running his mouth like, Muhammad Ali
So I shook his hand calmly as I headed to the door
On my way to the ghetto to treat once more

If I ruled the world (huh huh, huh huh huh)
I'd love all the girls  (I'd love em love em baby!)
Wear diamonds and pearls (oh yeah yeah)
If I ruled the world (yeahhhhh)

If I ruled the world (if I ruled the world)
I'd love all the girls  (I'd love em love em baby!)
Wear diamonds and pearls (oh yeah yeah oh yeah yeah)
If I ruled the world (whoa whoa yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)",https://genius.com/Kurtis-blow-if-i-ruled-the-world-lyrics
I Can’t Take it No More,Ego Trip,1984,"I'm about to squeeze off on everyone that I know
'Cause every time they see me they ask for dough
They think I'm rich 'cause my name is Kurtis Blow
I can't stand it, I can't take it no more
(I can't stand it, I can't take it no more) (x4)
I can't take it no more (x4)
Lookin' out my window five stories up
I see a wino with a bottle he don't need a cup
And there's a hooker in the alley way
Takin' a chance, tryin' to make a day's pay
But the rats in the alley are takin' a stand
Chewin' on somethin' that used to be a man
I can't stand it, I can't take it no more (x2)
I can't take it no more (x4)
Gun shots just up the block
By a kid whose head is hard as a rock
A lady with a baby who was crossing the street
Gets hit by a bullet and falls off her feet
The people gather round,the baby is crying
The ambulance is late and the lady is dying
The trigger happy did not step off that day
But the lady with the baby was a D-O-A
I can't stand it, I can't take it no more (x2)
I can't take it no more (x8)",https://genius.com/Kurtis-blow-i-cant-take-it-no-more-lyrics

8 Million Stories,Ego Trip,1984.0,"There are 8 million stories in the naked city
8 million stories
8 million stories (Cold-hearted city)
8 million stories (Watch your back)
8 million stories

There are 8 million stories in the naked city
Some ice cold and told without pity
About the mean streets and the ghetto culture
The pimps, the pushers, the sharks and vultures
Things that happen when it reaches dark
And all the things you hear about Central Park
You got to be down, you got to have strength
If you're gonna survive past 110th
Well it ain't no thing when blood is spilled
The emergency ward is capacity filled
And nothing ever comes as a big surprise
And the naked city never closes its eyes
A new story every day
Told a thousand different ways
That's how it is and that's how it goes
The city with the 8 and six big O's
New York is a crazy city man
Word, skyscrapers, everything
And you just never know who you might be meting in this town
Yo, my home boys Run DMC

A young girl seemed to be gaining weight
Her parents all thought it was the food she ate
Their attitudes were all ""La Di Da Di""
But little did they know there's a baby in the body
She tried to hide it, but they'll soon know
Because sooner or later that baby's got to show
Can her daddy just accept it as a fact
That it wasn't the meals and it wasn't the snack
Then there's another girl, her name is Vicki
The girl is fine, but sho'nuff tricky
Vicki's fine, but then she's not very kind
She'll lay you down and then she'll rob you blind
You wake up in the morning and you're feeling blue
Because Vicki is gone and your money is too
She's more sinister than Peter Lorre
And this is just two of 8 million stories
8 million stories
8 million stories
8 million stories (You hear what i'm saying)
8 million stories (Homeboys and girlies)
8 million stories
8 million stories
8 million stories
8 million stories
8 million stories (Sing)
8 million stories (Sing the song)
8 million stories
8 million stories

Fresh kid and the stories complete
Born on a dim lit ghetto street
Father unknown, mother astray
He learned about life the real hard way
Wearing pretty things for all the ladies to see
Funky fresh diamonds and gold jewelry
Spent all his time just counting his bank
Because he's a fly muh-ha-ha, now fill in the blank
Because he's a fresh kid and his money's long
Been the subject of a ghetto song
Poor kids admire, ladies desire
They say water can't put out this fire
Because he's a fresh kid, yeah he's alright
Grew up with the pushers and the pimps of the night
And you could measure or even treasure
The thought that cocaine became his pleasure
Peruvian rock never cut with speed
And he gets skied until his nose would bleed
And that was just one weakness, must admit
That when he took a hit he could never quit
Because he's one slick pusher living day by day
When the crazy thing happened along the way
You know he started to base at a hell a pace
And now it's a disgrace, he's got the pipe in his face
For twenty-four seven a terrible Jones
Didn't take care of business, didn't answer the phone
He stayed home alone all in the twilight zone
Just biting on a pipe like a dog on a bone
Turning blue in the face, by just holding his breath
With the white cloud bullshit stuck in his chest
But then he tried to stop, but it never worked
And then the ladies started calling him a freebase jerk
Just to break it all down, you know he's not so slick
Because he spent all his money and he spent it real quick
He lost his car, his house, his friends, his wife
And basing cocaine made him lose his life
Because he bought some on credit and couldn't pay
And then the pusher looked for him and blew him away
In a blaze of glory in his own territory
8 million sad but all real stories
8 million stories
8 million stories
8 million stories (You hear what i'm saying)
8 million stories (Homeboys and girlies)

"Rappin’ Blow, Pt. 2",Kurtis Blow,1980.0,"What did you say your name was?

I see, that it's not clear
For you, good buddy, so clean out your ears
Listen very closely while I pop more game
'Cause my name's in the Hall of Fame
The K-U-R, the T-I-S
The first is the best, I must confess
The B-L-O and the W
I make you wanna catch the boogaloo flu

Get up off your fanny
If your name is Clyde
Get off your backside
If your name is Pete
You don't need a seat
'Cause I'm Kurtis Blow and I'm on the go
I'm rocking to the rhythms in stere-ere-o

Now, just throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
If you're ready, like Freddy, to rock real steady
Somebody say, oh yeah! (Oh yeah!)
Young ladies, all the ladies in the house, say, oww! (Oww!)
And you don't stop
Come on, come on, come on, let me see you rock
A get down! Stop messing around
When Kurtis Blow is in your town
I'm Kurtis Blow on the microphone
A place called Harlem was my home
I was rocking one day, it started to shake
It sounded to me a-like a earthquake
I packed my bags, I said goodbye
I kissed my woman, and I started to fly
I came to Earth by a meteorite
To rock you all on the mic
So just kick off your shoes, let your fingers pop
'Cause Kurtis Blow's just about ready to rock

Now the people in the back, if you're not the wack, say
(Don't stop the body rock!)
The people in the front, if you want to bump, say
(Don't stop the body rock!)
The people in the middle, if you want to wiggle, say
(Don't stop the body rock!)
And the people on the side, if you want to slide, say
(Don't stop the body rock!)

Not a preacher, or a teacher, or an e-lec-tri-cian
A fighter, or a writer, or a po-li-ti-cian
The man with the key to your ignition
Kurtis Blow is competition
Young ladies, shock the house, jazzy
Yes, young ladies, shock the house
Now, just throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
If y'all really ready to rock the house this morning
Somebody say, oh yeah! (Oh, yeah!)
Somebody scream!

Young ladies, Mercedes
All the ladies in the house, say, oww! (Oww!)
Say, ho! (Ho!)
Ho! (Ho!)
Ho oh! (Ho oh!)


A yes, yes, y'all, keep on
Chick-a-rock-rock-rock, the rock-rock-rock
And don't stop the body rock
And everybody say, ho! (Ho!)
Ho! (Ho!)
And all the brothers, fly guys, get high
Say, macho! (Macho!)
Macho! (Macho!)
Mucho macho! (Mucho macho!)
Ooh, ahh, ooh-ooh ahh! (Ooh, ahh, ooh-ooh ahh!)

Keep on, rocking on
Keep, keep on, rock the hip, the hop on
Like a little boy blue blowing on a horn
The needle on the record, tryna play a song
It's been that way since the day I was born
I like a 25 cent bag of popcorn
Dip-dip-dab, so-socialize
Clean out your ears and open up your eyes
So you goin' here can realize
That I'm here to tranquilize
Got the knack of Kojak, better than Baretta
Casanova Brown, because I'm down
Get down, stop messing around
When Kurtis Blow is in your town
I'm a one of a kind, I'll wreck your mind
Put a wiggle-double-wiggle in your behind
Twice as nice, I'm skatin' on ice
When my mama gave birth, she named me the baddest
MC on Earth, y'all

Yo, my brother, i ain't really got it like that
What we got here is hard times
I hear you, brother, but what's up with that?

Hard times spreading just like the flu
You know I caught it just like you
The prices going up, the dollars down
You got me fallin' to the ground
Turn around, get ready, check out the time
Get ready all people for the future shock
Hard times (Hard times)
Hard times (Hard times)
To the bridge


Hard times people of the planet
Times are tough, tough is granted
Hard times coming to your town
Get ready cause you know, we're gonna throw down
I'm gonna go out there and get the skills
My life's been down and I need a thrill
Hard times (Hard times)
Hard times (Hard times)
To the bridge


Hard times's got my pockets all in change
I tell ya what, it don't have my brains
Will I ever-ever-ever reach my peak
We need that dollar every day of the week
Hard times you know, it's a natural trip
I'm gonna keep about it, so we'll not slip
Hard times (Hard times)
Hard times (Hard times)
To the bridge


Hard times is nothing new or mean
I'm gonna use my strong mentality
Like the cream of the crop and the crop of the cream
Beating hard times, that is my dream
Hard times in life, hard times in death

Your ups and downs
Your highs and your lows
I'm the man with the mic who rocks the house
The man called Kurtis Blow
So get out your seat and grab a girl
'casue I'm about ready to rock the world
And listen to my story because it got to be told
Like an Oscar winning actor when he is playing a role
When I wasn't the best, there was something in my head
To be a rapper was my dream
Like in the morning with the bacon, and the eggs, and the coffee, and the cream
So I made up my mind that I would always try to be the best that I can be
Now here I am, rapping at the jam
With the all the fly guys and the young ladies
Just take your time, you don't have to hurry
Hang tough, you don't have to worry
In society, the strong survive
So rap a single or get a nine to five
With a little hard work and dedication we'll pull together and rock the nation
So if you do the do and think you are great, come on everybody, participate
Say ""ho""
You gotta to say ""ho"" if you are ready to go
Say ""ow""
You gotta to say ""ow"" if you are ready right now
Say pride
Cause pride is what we got inside
To the top!
We are going to the top, we ain't going to stop!
Get down!
When it started out, the way wasn't clear
There was much confusion and a lot of fear
Walking in the shadow, searching for the light
Be the reason i could be that to make me right
Cause it ain't all champaign and cavier
Riding 'round the town in the finest car
Living in the star life of luxury
And being seen 'round the world at the place to be
Let down, no jobs ... checks hang up... back sets ...
A thousand things can hold you back and try to run you off the track
So you got to believe you can be the best
You got to work real hard to achieve success
So listen close, cause I insist
I got some advice, it goes just like this:
Take your time, you don't have to hurry
Hang tough, you don't have to worry
In society, the strong survive
So rap a single or get a nine to five
With a little hard work and dedication we'll pull together and rock the nation
So if you do the do and think you are great, come on everybody and participate
Say ""Ho""!
You gotta to say ""ho"" if you're ready to go
Say ""ow""!
You gotta to say ""ow"" if you're ready right now
Say ""pride""!
Cause pride is what we got inside
Say top!
We're goin' to the top, we ain't gonna stop
Get down!
There is a man up there who's calling the shots
He says what is going to happen and what's not
There is only one way to stake a claim
You got to be a man
You gotta to play the game
Some people you may be around have negative vibes and try to get you down
But you mighty sound and you're really strong
You got to ... riding along
Winter, summer, fall, spring
Give it your all and everything
Step by step, day by day
Watch out for obstacles in your way
Don't be no other, be yourself
You can do that better than anyone else
Now, I can't tell you what to do, but the things I say still come true
Take your time, you don't have to hurry
Hang tough, you don't have to worry
In society, the strong survive
So rap a single or get a nine to five
With a little hard work and dedication we'll pull together and rock the nation
So if you do the do and think you are great, come on everybody, participate!

Tough,"Kurtis Blow, The Best Rapper On The Scene",1983,"I don't want a lot, I want just enough
So why has it got to be so damn tough
Livin' on the uptown side of jive
Hustlin' a buck to stay alive
Lookin' for a ten and they give your five
Well it's tough
You talk to the boss, the boss is gruff
You ask for a raise and they call your bluff
You may get some, but it's never enough
Because it's tough
STRONG: Like a magnum force
ROUGH: Like a new divorce
MEAN: Like a three-time loser
BAD: Like an L.A. cruiser
DOWN: Like a limousine
BLIND: Like a submarine
HARD: Like cold concrete
TOUGH: That's the rhythm of the beat
You hit the street and you look for work
You don't want to be some welfare jerk
But I wonder how you get to be Captain Kirk
It's tough
Now Kirk has a ship called the Enterprise
He cuts the aliens down to size
But I wonder what he'd do with the uptown guys
They're tough
TOUGH:
Try to get some cash
When you're looking for a raise and they give you trash
ROUGH:
When you got it like that
And your woman's running 'round with a baseball bat
HARD:
Try to play it cool
When the girls all know you're an out of work fool
TOUGH:
How it seems to be
Wish I had somebody lookin' out for me
Try to find a lover if you dare
Even if you do she just won't care
Well no one ever said that that life is fair
Because it's tough
Saw a fine young lady the other day
I started my rap, I had a lot to say
But she said 
she was goin' with a C.P.A
Now it's tough
STRONG: Like a superhero
ROUGH:Like a bank book zero
MEAN: Like the Oakland Raiders
BAD: Like the Caped Crusaders
DOWN: Like a homerun ball
BLIND: Like an umpire's call
HARD: Like a cruel deceit
TOUGH: That's the rhythm of the beat
You worked all year to buy a brand new car
A Coupe de Ville or a Jaguar
But you didn't make enough for a good cigar
Because it's tough
So you went to the bank to try to get a loan
But the guy behind the desk had a heart of stone
He said ""You don't need a car, use the telephone!""
It's tough
TOUGH:
It's a way of life, lost your job
Your money, but not your wife
ROUGH:
Gettin' in the black, Uncle Sam's in your pocket
And your woman's on your back
HARD:
That's the deal, had to get a loan just to buy a meal
TOUGH:
That's how it goes, when it's gettin' better, nobody knows
STRONG: Like Chocolate Thunder
ROUGH: Like Stevie Wonder
MEAN: Like 
Brucie The Shark
BAD: Like the 
Raider's Ark
DOWN: Like Sugar's Glove
BLIND: Like a man in love
HARD: Like a big defeat
TOUGH: That's the rhythm of the beat
TOUGH:That's the word, unemployment is all I heard
ROUGH:When you start your day, watch the finance man tow your car away
HARD:To hold a job when you've been replaced by a little blue knob
TOUGH:Like a dollar steak, ain't someone ever gonna give me a break?

I’m Chillin’,Kingdom Blow,1986.0,"Chill out! Transformers, don't come in disguise

T-Bone!, nasty, say what?
Say Go, go, Kurtis Blow y'all
Gimme the bomb!
I'm chillin' haha
Go through it!
Dance!

Now the next little item that I wanna discuss
Is about the sucker rappers who must be smokin' dust
When you make the kinda records that diss females
Frontin' on a story when it's just a tall tale
To diss a female is a lowdown shame
But you suckers make the records 'cause you wanna get fame
All you radio cats, don't play that crap
Can't you see they're messin' up in all the name of the rap?
Now all these years rappers worked so hard
To give rapping a name and all you rappers a job
But now you peasy-head B-boys got me upset
When you diss around and cut and then you just defect
Don't forget LaToya and the real Roxanne
Can't you think of something else, you know what I'm sayin'?
But all you MCs just keep on illin'
That's okay, cause I'm chillin'

Transformers – Dance! -- don't come in disguise
Transformers – Dance! -- don't come in disguise
I'm chillin'
Gimme the bomb!

Now wherever you go, I just want you to know
That I'm running the show, at twenty below
So let me tell you what it takes since the others are fake
It must've been a mistake but those are the breaks
I'm a Leo the Lion, the lion with desire
When I'm rappin' on the mic I set the world on fire
Devastatin', motivatin', complicatin', perpatratin' rappers who want to be, on top
Stop! Can't you see me and Trouble Funk is rockin' the spot, yeah!
And don't you ever forget it trooper! Workin' all day, it's time for
Superman just to give you a break
Along with a go-go band, yes yes y'all
Can't you understand? What's the name of this jam?
I'm chillin'!
Transformers
Get funky
Transformers

To the bridge!
Get ready for it y'all. Get ready baby

Daydreamin’,The Best of Kurtis Blow,1982.0,"Looking back through time in the corners of my mind
I see you standing here
Oh baby how I miss you
And how much I need to kiss you
Run my fingers through your hair
But then again, it's just my imagination
Being close to you was such a sweet sensation
But then we had to have that terrible confrontation
Now all I can do to help this situation
Daydreamin' takes me where I want to be
Daydreamin' lets me have you here with me
Oh, girl if you knew all that I've been going through
You'd have a change of heart
But come rain or shine you're forever on my mind
Of my life you're the part
But then again, it's just my imagination
Being close to you was such a sweet sensation
But then we had to have that terrible confrontation
Now all I can do to help this situation
Daydreamin' takes me where I want to be
Daydreamin' lets me have you here with me
Daydreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you
You stole my heart and I belong to you
Daydreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you
You are the one and I will be true

Way Out West,Kurtis Blow,1980.0,"Way out west from way back east
Coming from a place you'd expect the least
There came a stranger, dressed in black
From a Harlem Town, a long way back
Had a Stetson hat with a band of gold
Eyes like steel, make your blood run cold
Had a microphone hanging by his side
Just ready to be amplified
Rode into town on a big black steed
Lookin' for a man named Ganamede
I hear the dude just won't get down
If I rock this world I can rock this town!
And when they asked him for his name
He said ""Kurtis Blow, I play the rappin' game
I can do the do, I can do the deed
And tonight I'm gonna rock Ganamede!""
Now Ganamede thought he was cool
Wore Gucci shoes, had a fancy school
A fancy job in a big corporation
Fancy girls all across the nation
Fancy car, fancy clothes
Fancy friends and fancy dough
Only one thing he wouldn't do
Is let himself get down with you
The stranger went to the old saloon
Grabbed his mike and spun a tune
And everyone in the whole darn place
Said ""Do the rap and set that pace!""
He rapped 'em down and he rapped 'em out
He made 'em dance and he made 'em shout
He said ""If you like Kurtis Blow
Then let me hear you all say...
A say ho-oo! Ho-oo!
Hi-yo! Hi-yo!
Say Kurtis! Kurtis!
Say Kurtis Blow! Kurtis Blow!
At midnight Ganamede came in
To watch the dancers move and spin
He took a seat over by the bar
And started smokin' a big cigar
""I admit the stranger is not bad
But tonight I'm gonna make him sad
'Cause I don't care about the groove
There ain't no dude gonna make me move!""
The joint was jumpin' hard at one
But Ganamede was havin' none
Things were really fly at two
The stranger rapped and the tension grew
But Ganamede maintained his cool
""I'll make the stranger play the fool
'Cause I don't care about the groove
There ain't no dude gonna make me move!""
The showdown came at three o'clock
The stranger said, ""I'm gonna make you rock
I'm gonna make you move, I'm gonna make you dance
They're gonna take you out in an ambulance
Now everybody lend a hand
I'm gonna make you be the band
There ain't no jive, no superstition
We're gonna have a little demolition
Get down!
Now stomp your feet
To the funky beat
Just clap your hands
And let the beat expand
Let me here the bass
Put it in my face
Let the guitar play
Just put it away
And now I think we've got the groove
So Ganamede, get up and move!""
Now everyone looked at the bar
At the lonely man with the big cigar
He began to move, he began to shake
He'd had as much as he could take
He took his body to the floor
And then the crowd began to roar
The stranger just had done the deed
And rocked the house with Ganamede
From three to four he couldn't stop
From four to five he just had to rock
From five to six he let it loose
At seven he still had the juice
At eight o'clock he was goin' strong
Gettin' down with every song
At nine o'clock he couldn't dance
And someone called an ambulance
As they put him in the back
Of that big white shiny Cadillac
He said ""Please get me Kurtis Blow
There's something that he ought to know""
He said ""I thought I'd make my name
By beatin' you at the rappin' game
But you beat me fair and square
And anyway, I just don't care.""
The stranger asked him what he meant
Said Ganamede, ""I am content
I never used to catch a groove
I never used to dance or move
But it's more fun to play the fool
Than tryin' hard to be real cool
So anytime you're back in town
I'm gonna get up and I'm gonna get down!""
The stranger watched him drive away
Knowing what he'd done that day
And then he went right back inside
To make the dancers slip and slide
To rock 'em out, to rock 'em in
To make 'em rock it down again
And he said ""If you like my sound
Let me hear you all say...
Throw down! Throw down!
At the showdown! At the showdown!
Throw down! Throw down!
At the showdown! At the showdown!
Now stomp your feet
To the funky beat
Just clap your hands
And let the beat expand
Let me here the bass
Put it in my face
Let the guitar play
Just put it away
A-rock on!",https://genius.com/Kurtis-blow-way-out-west-lyrics
Takin’ Care Of Business,Kurtis Blow,1980.0,"They get up every morning
From the alarm clock's warning
Take the 8 15 into the city
There's a whistle up above
And people push and people shove
And all the girls
Who try to look pretty
And if your train's on time
You can get to work by 9
And start your slaving job
To get your pay
If you ever get annoyed
Look at me, I'm self-employed
I love to work at nothing all day
And I've been
Takin' care of business

Takin' care of business

I've been takin' care of business

You could be a musician
If you could make sounds
Loud or mellow
Get a second hand guitar
Chances are you'll go far
If you get in with
The right bunch of fellows
People see you having fun
Just a-lying in the sun
And tell them that
You like it this way

And we're all self employed

Fallin',fallin',back in love
I'm back in love again

I say I'm back,right back in love again
Suddenly it's happening again
I'm walking along the seashore
Building castles in the sand
And suddenly all my dreams have come true
And if at all love is the question
Then girl the answer's you
I feel I'm fallin'.....

Back in love,I'm back in love again
I tried to fight as best I can
It seems to happen every now and then
I'm falling back in love,I'm back in love again
So many times love's broke my heart
But it seems to me it's time to start again

Shadows dancing all across my wall
I called your name but it was all in vain
Because it wasn't you at all
So, I had to find you
Some way my love some how
And now my dear since you are here
Tell me how do you like me now
That I'm fallin'.......

Like the sun will shine in the summertime
I don't do no crimes 'cause I just rhyme
I drive a Benz and I got a lot of friends

Or Jerome Avenue or Gun Hill Road

Called the Bronx

I have the Power
Coitainly!

Chilling at the club 371
Blacks, Puerto Ricans, Italians and Jews
Bronx River Casanovas and the Ninth Crew. (called)

I'll be a Bronx boy 'til the day I die
It's called the Bronx

If you got what it takes
'Cause I'm Kurtis Blow and I want you to know

Brakes on a bus, brakes on a car
Breaks to make you a superstar
Breaks to win and breaks to lose
But these here breaks will rock your shoes
And these are the breaks
Break it up, break it up, break it up!
If your woman steps out with another man
(That's the breaks, that's the breaks)
And she runs off with him to Japan
(That's the breaks, that's the breaks)
And the IRS says they want to chat
(That's the breaks, that's the breaks)
And you can't explain why you claimed your cat
(That's the breaks, that's the breaks)
And Ma Bell sends you a whopping bill
(That's the breaks, that's the breaks)
With eighteen phone calls to Brazil
(That's the breaks, that's the breaks)
And you borrowed money from the mob
(That's the breaks, that's the breaks)
And yesterday you lost your job
(That's the breaks, that's the breaks)
Well, these are the breaks
Break it up, break it up, break it up!
Throw your hands up in the sky
And wave 'em 'round from side to side
And if you deserve a break tonight
Somebody say all right!
(All right)
Say ho!
(Ho!)
You don't stop
Keep on, somebody scream!

Breaks to make your wallet lean
Breaks run cold and breaks run hot
Some folks got 'em and some have not

To the guy in blue, whatcha gonna do?

You say last week you met the perfect guy
(That's the breaks, that's the breaks)
And he promised you the stars in the sky
(That's the breaks, that's the breaks)
He said his Cadillac was gold
(That's the breaks, that's the breaks)
But he didn't say it was ten years old
(That's the breaks, that's the breaks)
He took you out to the Red Coach grill
(That's the breaks, that's the breaks)
But he forgot the cash and you paid the bill
(That's the breaks, that's the breaks)
And he told you the story of his life
(That's the breaks, that's the breaks)
But he forgot the part about--his wife! Huh! Huh!
(That's the breaks, that's the breaks)
Well, these are the breaks!
Break it up, break it up, break it up
Break down! Ya!",https://genius.com/Kurtis-blow-the-breaks-part-1-lyrics
Juice,"Kurtis Blow, The Best Rapper On The Scene",1983,"I was walkin' down the avenue the other day
When I heard this crazy sound
It was nothing but a  guy with a set of drums
But he was really gettin' down
He said my name is Jack and I'm a rhythm attack
When I got a pair of sticks in hand
I got savoir-faire on the bass and snare
And I'm here to take my stand
I got juice
The next to show was a guy named Joe
Came in from Kalamazoo
Had a Kangol cap with a real smooth rap
And he knew just what to do
He was an outta work bricklayer, part-time conga player
Brought along a set of LP's
Don't do a lot of talkin', let my fingers do the walkin'
And I play just as pretty as you please
I got juice
There was a guy with a bass,had a handsome face
And designer clothes all around
He said I'm into threads, don't wear Pro Keds
But I can make that funky sound
I play Fender Jazz, I got razz-ma-tazz
I got style from head to toe
It's a funky sound that I learned uptown
And I'm here to let you know
I got juice
About a minute went by when another guy
Showed up with an old guitar
Well it had to be from World War III
Or run over by a car
It don't look like much, but it's sweet to touch
They don't make 'em like this today
It's been around, but check the sound
Then see what you say
I got juice
There was a dude with a bongo, came from the Congo
Had a rough beat of his own
He dressed real strange,wore beads and chains
But he could rock you all alone
He said call me Chief and I've got relief
For those weary dancin' blues
I got jungle heat from a primitive beat
And I know I'll move your shoes,HUH-HUH
I got juice
The next to show was Kurtis Blow
With timbales in his hands
Well I'm known for rap and I play with snap
And I think you'll understand
Now I was taught to play in a different way
By a dude known as Delgado
He said listen to me and you soon will be
A timbale desperado
I got juice
What do you say when you're bustin' loose?
(Juice!, Juice!)
It's good for the gander and chilly for the goose
(Juice!, Juice!)
Breakin' out from that weekday noose
(Juice!, Juice!)
Gettin' down on the one and up on the deuce
(Juice!, Juice!)",https://genius.com/Kurtis-blow-juice-lyrics
"Baby, You’ve Got to Go","Kurtis Blow, The Best Rapper On The Scene",1983,"I know your last man did you wrong

And I know that your intentions are basically good
But there's one more thing that I definitely know
It's baby, you've got to go
And I'm sure you'd cook if you knew how to use a pot
And I'm sure you'd clean if the soaps weren't so hot
And I'm sure you'd mop the floors if you weren't afraid of hot water
And I'm sure you do the laundry if you only had a quarter
And I'm sure that I wish that it just wasn't so
But baby, you've got to go
And I know that you want a career in high fashion
'Cause when you buy your clothes you do it with passion
Well that's chilly by me,you do what you will
But when you're finished,don't send me the bill
'Cause Halston and Jordache got enough of my dough
So baby, you've got to go
I'm sure you've got problems I can't understand
And I'm sure it's because I'm only a man
And I'm sure if I had an astounding I.Q
I could solve all the problems that happen to you
But I ain't no genius,I just take it slow
So baby, you've got to go
Now I know you're worried about what Erica will do tomorrow
But that won't help pay back the money you borrow
And I know that each person must be someplace my dear
But I really don't know why you must be here
So this is the day for your last tale of woe

When you drop out of sight

On Monday morning, he checks the news
He's number one in rhythm and blues
From record to record he tops the sheet
And the other stars cannot compete
He hits the notes that are so high
The men just stare and the women cry
They come to see him from near and far
The man they made a superstar
The genuine owner of twenty cars
Spends all his days among the stars
And when he's got to cool out and chill
Got a brand new house at the top of the hill
One of a kind, not even two
Push button down with an open view
And every room's got a new TV
And every dog's got a pedigree
Livin' every day in the life of a star
Star life!
Livin' every day in the life of a star
Star life!
Huh!
He's got a mansion up in Beverly Hills
With a great big swimming pool
Got a townhouse back in old New York
Where he used to go to school
And some folks say
He's got his own chalet
If he wants to go and ski
And a house in France
For a little romance
Outside of gay Pari!

Desire
Under fire
(VERSE ONE)
Hello party people, I'm Kurtis Blow
King of the rap and a 10 years pro
The ladies heart stopper, the fly guys best
A sureshot rocker and I'm always fresh
But when I try make it, they try to take it
And it ain't in my nature just to fake it
So bust my moves, you'll never stop me
I'm the best MC, I could never be
(CHORUS)
(VERSE TWO)
Here I am rappin', they call me the king
But there's more to me than just doing my thing
Wanna move ahead, got to make a choice
Got to make this planet hear my voice
Lebanon, Russia, Iraq and Iran
Too many people dyin' playing Superman
Be cool, don't be no fool
Please Mr. Reagan don't put me
(CHORUS)
(VERSE THREE)
I'm Kurtis Blow and I want you to see
To make it today we need unity
Do not fear reality
Cause they can't stop what was meant to be (Even under fire)
Trying hard to make through the easy way of life
Thinking you can fake it with a pistol or a knife
You live it, you give it, you do it, you blew it
And then you want to tell everybody you knew it
It's easy to point your fingers
And say you and you and you're wrong
But when it's time to be about unity
Huh-huh-huh you sing another song
Oh baby
Oh baby
Oh baby
Oh baby, baby
Well I am the member of a new breed
And the solution is a revolution
So I hope you all see the light
Hear my name....Unite!To the next phase

The Boogie Blues,"Kurtis Blow, The Best Rapper On The Scene",1983,"Now's the time when things are hot
To show the world just what you've got
Just grab a partner,hit the floor
'Cause this is what you're waiting for
It's time for us to take a chance
So get on up,got out and dance
Just shout it out and spread the news
About those low-down Boogie blues
Now The Boogie Blues is nothin' new
It started back in '22
Some guys and girls were sittin' 'round
In a little club outside of town
In walked a dude from parts unknown
Without a friend,he was all alone
Dressed up in tails and button shoes
He taught them all The Boogie Blues
I've got a dance you ought to know
It's no too fast and not too slow
It's not to hard and not too easy
Not too straight and not too sleazy
Something different,something new
Something special just for you
Something just to rock your shoes
Something called The Boogie Blues
The Boogie Blues has got the beat
The Boogie Blues will move your feet
Feel the beat and spread the news
About those low-down Boogie Blues
The dude got up to whirl and dance
Just like a dervish in a trance
Spinning,twirling,up and down
Round and round and round and round
Just like  Bojangles or Astaire
A dapper dude without a care
With flying feet,top hat and cane
You knew he only drank champagne
Just watching him would keep you busy
Make you feel a little dizzy
Such a sight for all to see
The Boogie Blues done to a ""T""
Leaping high and doing splits
The crowd was simply having fits
They cheered until their throats were dry
But soon he had to say goodbay
I've had a ball the stranger said
But I should quit while I'm ahead
Those splits and leaps are hard to do
They really take it out of you
But in a minute when I am gone
The night is young,it's far from dawn
You've seen the dance,you've heard the news
It's time to do The Boogie Blues
The Boogie Blues has got the beat
The Boogie Blues will move your feet
Feel the beat and spread the news
About those low-down Boogie Blues",https://genius.com/Kurtis-blow-the-boogie-blues-lyrics

Where the scene is tough and the folks are hip
I can't tell a lie cause it ain't no myth
I'm talking about a Hundred Twenty Fifth
Foxy ladies everywhere
Skin tight jeans and jazzy hair
Clothes for the body, shoes for the feet
And lots of tasty things to eat
A Hundred and Twenty Fifth Street
The people and the concrete
The hottest spot to work and play
Main Street, Harlem, USA!
Original paintings on the walls
Music stores and bingo halls
Apollo's gone, but that's OK
There's lots of music anyway
The Baby Grand is still going strong
Celebrity Club rocks all night long
Sikulu Records is on the case
And Bobby's chillin' out in the same old place
Lots of folks have passed this way
Malcolm X and Billie Holiday
Fidel Castro, The Commodores
Heads of State and troubadours
The Count, The Duke, The Pres, The Bird
Have bought music and that's my word
Dionne Warwick, Stevie Wonder
Have all come for Harlem's thunder
Marcus Garvey and JFK
Meadowlark Lemon and Doctor J
And Doctor Martin Luther King
All came to Harlem to do their thing
Louis, Jack Johnson and Ali
The heavyweight to name but three
Bill Bojangles and James Brown
Spent their time in Harlem Town
Con-men, poets, saints and sinners
Three time losers and all time winners
Politicians, fools and sages
Enough to fill a million pages
So take the trip and come alive

Where I was born one August day

Nervous,Party Time?,UnKnown,"You talkin' to me? You make me nervous

Now my generation
Has got this inclination
To think this ain't the land of milk and honey
Missiles every place
Can destroy the human race
And everyone is cryin' for more money
There's an actor and a spy
Who can't see eye to eye
Well who gives them the right to run the place?
There are brothers who are sisters
And misses who are misters
And things keep fallin' down from outer space

And everybody says they want to serve us
But the only thing they do is make me nervous
Really makes me nervous

Corporate leaders smokin' joints
Big time athletes shavin' points
And all the time they do it with a smile (Smile)
Middle class communters
Stealin' millions with computers
And they might just get probation for a while
But for ordinary folk
The legal's system's just a joke
They're laughin' from New York to the coast
They bargain on the plea
And the lawyer gets his fee
And everybody's happy
Well, almost

And everybody says they want to serve us
But the only thing they do is make me nervous
Really makes me nervous

If you're not a lazy slob
You go lookin' for a job
But I hope that you ain't lookin' in Detroit
Where they used to make cars
All they do is hit the bars
'Cause the Japanese have markets to exploit
The rich keep getting richer
Drink Martinis by the pitcher
While the rest of us are lookin' for a break
We play lotto and the number
While the politicians slumber
'Cause the politicians know it's all fake

And everybody says they want to serve us
But the only thing they do is make me nervous
Really makes me nervous
Really makes me nervous

The meaning is right here
Mr. Nixon made it clear
Make sure you hit record when you roll the tape
The stuff that gets leftover
Might just keep you out the clover
And you'll never, ever make your great escape
So I hope you've learned the lesson
It's the message of the session
You can take it, but you got to take it slow
Keep it cool and keep it clean
Do it all behind the scene
And if they ask you, just tell 'em you don't know

And everybody says they want to serve us
But the only thing they do is make me nervous
Really makes me nervous (Wo!)

About the day you had
You've got to find a way to make it right
And if your body's got the juice
And you're feelin' kinda loose
You're stepping out and throwing down tonight
There's a million different ways
To make it through the days
To get yourself a shot-of exercise
But the only way I know
To let my body go
Is dancin' 'til the sun begins to rise
I got to dance

You can go to the gym
Work it out, take a swim
Or play a little ball with the guys
You can try a machine
To keep your body mean
But that's the kind of work that I despise
You can run in the sun
But it's never, ever fun
'Cause people are tired of routine
So the only way for me
To set my body free
Is dancin' with the ladies on the scene
I got to dance

You can go to the Fifty-Four
If they let you in the door
But it really doesn't matter anyway
All you do is hit the spot
Where the beat is runnin' hot
And let the music take you far away
The DJ is the dude
To keep you in the mood
To keep you dancin' 'til you have to drop
You got to feel the beat
To generate the heat
To make you say you never wanna stop
You got to dance

You can sit at home and chill
Gettin' fat until you're ill
And what you do is really up to you
But if you like to party
And I mean party hardy
Then maybe I can tell you what to do
Now I know a lot of ways
To get me through the days
But nighttime is the time I come alive
I like to kick it all around
Kick it up and kick it down

The Deuce,Deuce,1981.0,"42nd Street, last stop
Watch your step, heading off

You got freaks and losers, cops and boozers, pushers on the run
Pimps and junkies, kids with monkeys and lots of dirty fun
Drugs and hookers, squares and lookers moving to the beat
Porno stores and troubadours on 42nd Street
Days are hazy, nights are crazy, hustles never end
There's lots of folks, with lots of jokes, but try to find a friend
If you want advice about paradise then let me introduce
The cast and crew that's waiting for you on the street they call the Deuce, check it out!

In this world I know a girl who looks as sweet as spice
And when it's late you can have a date, but you have to pay the price
I know a big time gambler, heavy scammer, never bets less than a G
He's gotta lot of bread but here's what I said, it all came from you and me
There's a kid crusader playing Space Invader down in the old arcade
Don't go to school, he's much too cool, though he's kind of underpaid
The guys are soused and the girls are boozed, gotta lot of lies to tell
They don't fear the Lord, they get no reward and they're spending time in Hell, check it out!


Every day the politicians say they're gonna tear the whole thing down
But wait a couple years, check you eyes and ears, the Deuce will still be around
Drugs and ,  or  are easy things to find
They tip the scales with fairy tales and slowly blow your mind
If you desire to feel the fire that's burning on the block
Then take a trip down to the strip, but be prepared for a shock
'Cause if you're shaky or even flaky, hear me when I say
When you're on the Deuce you got to be loose or you might get blown away!",https://genius.com/Kurtis-blow-the-deuce-lyrics
Rockin’,Deuce,1981,"I walked in this spot, it was about a quarter to three
To check out the music and the young ladies
I saw a pretty girl and said ""Hey I feel like romancin'""
She said ""Get away boy, can't you see I'm dancin'""

She was rockin'
She was rockin'
And she was rockin'
And she was rockin'

Now, when she stopped dancin' it was a quarter to four
She took a seat at the bar beside the door
I said to the lady, ""Hey girl, can I, can I dance with you next?""
She said ""Okay boy, get off your ""

We were rockin'
We were rockin'
And we were rockin'
And we were rockin'

Now when we stopped dancin' it was about a quarter to six
The DJ was about to spin his very last mix
Then a pretty little lady she said "" stop""
I said ""Oh no, not until you drop""

'Cause I was rockin'
I was rockin'
Yes I was rockin'
Oh I was rockin'",https://genius.com/Kurtis-blow-rockin-lyrics
Sunshine,Kingdom Blow,1986,"You are my sunshine
My only sunshine
You make me happy
When skies are grey
You'll never know, dear
How much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away
The other night, dear
As I lay sleeping
I dreamt I held you in my arms
When I awoke, dear
I was mistaken
So I hung my head and cried
You are my sunshine
My only sunshine
You make me happy
When skies are grey
You'll never know, dear
How much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away
Please don't take my sunshine away",https://genius.com/Kurtis-blow-sunshine-lyrics
Big Time Hood,"Kurtis Blow, The Best Rapper On The Scene",1983,"You're all broke down, you're all depressed
You got no money to pay your debts
The biggest debt that you got
Is you gotta pay the boys from down the block
And they don't care about the worries you have
They only care about their own behalf
You never know where they may show
But one thing I do know, the boys are cold

Big time hood, you know you could
Scare everybody in the neighborhood
You're not afraid to take what you got
'Cause your friends are the boys from down the block
So you walk around, smoke big cigars
Wear diamond rings, drive fancy cars
You think you're cool, you think you're good
You're gonna pay one day, you big time hood

You won't walk the street
The cops won't walk their beat
'Cause you know better than I
They don't want to die
Now that it's understood
Pray to god and knock on wood
This world's ruled for good
This world's gone for good
By the big, the big, the big, the big time
The big, the big, the big, the big time hood
Big , the big, the big, the big time
You're gonna get it good, uh-uh
You big time hood

So you'll jump in the car, you leave this place
You end up in another state
When you get out the car, you turn around
You're about to faint and hit the ground
'Cause a mirage it is not
It's one of the boys from down the block
With an open hand he say ""Gimme the keys!""
He smacks your face when you said please
You're lucky that he let's you go
'Cause one thing I do know
The boys are cold",https://genius.com/Kurtis-blow-big-time-hood-lyrics

Summertime in the city

It's the season that I like best
When the guys get fly and the girls look fresh
The time of year when the atmosphere
Sets the trend with the warmth of air
The skies are bright, the temperature's right
I play basketball and I watch the fights
I step out my house, take a breath and stare
Can't you feel it baby-doll, summertime is in the air!

Turn on your stereo, turn up your beat-box
 the parks, the beach, city streets
Everywhere you go you can hear the beat
Of me Kurtis Blow in the summer's glow
Now I'm fully equipped with my MC show
So if you get bored, don't know what to do
Turn your radio on and I'll tell you
To get into the groove no time to waste
'Cause out of a year there's only a taste
You see, life in the city can even be pretty
But for those who sleep, well ain't that a pity
You gotta wake up 'cause you're missing the fun
And if you know what I know you got to have some
Get it while it's hot, get it while it's here

Get funky!

Night by night and day by day
Summertime in the city seems to fade away
I look into the sky, when Mother Nature called
She said dress a little warmer 'cause here comes the fall
One day you'll wake up when it comes to an end
Summertime in the city, goodbye my friends
But don't be sad and don't have no fear
'Cause summertime will be back next year!

When the great Kool Herc had the  pack

And the Lovebug Starski was trying to score
You know Grandmaster Flash will tell you no lie

AJ Meets Davy DMX,America,1985,"Let me tell you about a brother who's got my back
Cold chilling at a party when the party is packed
'Cause the party is packed and he gets fresher
He cuts the best when he's under pressure
I'm talkin' about the brother called AJ Scratch
There's not a beat that he can't catch!
He's so def he doesn't rehearse
And if you wanna see me, then he comes first
There's another DJ from Hollis, Queens
He's a disco dream on the mean machine
And I knew him ever since '78
And to the sucker DJs, I wanna set you straight
And now we're chill and we're ready to rock
Now from the bottom to the top, we'll rock non-stop
So, bust a move in rap history
When AJ Scratch meets Davy D!
Hit it!

(Davy!)
Hypnotizing, memorizing, all the times, a private scratcher!
(Davy!)
You know, I know, you know there's no one faster!
(Davy!)
Cuts the beat 'cause he got my back
(Davy D)
'Cause he could never be wack!

Two DJs are better than one
Now who's the crew that gets the job done?
One's from Hollis and one's from the Bronx
Freaky fresh to give you what you want
Faster than fast, fresher than fresher
One, two, three, could never be a lesser
On the top of the charts, is where we belong
So bring me your crew, 'cause your rim moves strong
Two DJs and one MC
And he's AJ Scratch and he's Davy D
Causing much damage and causing much pain
Tell a sucker DJ that we'll rock your brain
Destined to rock the quick mix
And to show you all it's not a bag of tricks
The hand, is quicker than the eye
So c'mon Davy D and give the quick mix a try!
Hit it!

(Davy!)
Hypnotizing, memorizing, all the times, a private scratcher!
(Davy!)
You know, I know, you know there's no one faster!
(Davy!)
Cuts the beat 'cause he got my back
(Davy D)
He could never be wack!

Going hard in the place to be
It's the number one choice for a fresh MC
And I'll rock the house without a doubt
That's all I'll be about
And when they open door, and then you come inside
You can bust my rap on my T-O-5
'Cause I'm a high-powered rapper, and sportin' Lees
To the sucker MC, I'll do the big cheese
Now all you DJs across the land
If you think you're bad, you better go join a band
'Cause ain't nobody faster than the man their hands
The handsome Davy D, from here to Japan
So if you ever want to battle sucker, step right up
'Cause Davy D is funky fresh with a cut
I know he's faster than any Grandmaster
A battle with us is like a battle with disaster!",https://genius.com/Kurtis-blow-aj-meets-davy-dmx-lyrics

One and two and welcome to the night
Gonna try to get it started, gonna try to give a life
To the party, everybody, come on dance
If you want the funk, come on, everybody take a chance
You can do it to it, nothing to it, just do it to dancefloor
Kicking it on the dancefloor
With the F-U-N-K funk! Otherwise known as the bomb

The party is kicking, quick and a flicking like a picking
It's fried yeah like chicken, huh it's finger lickin, good
In the party can never go down
You rock jam after jam and you see this record going round
No doubt we got the clout with the bomb
Straight off the farm, don't believe me ask your mom
Look the fly style is my style, now style, wildstyle
Mele make the party go rrah

We funk (we funk), therefore we are (therefore we are)
If you wanna get down tonight
The crew will set you right

On and on and on and on
And the funk won't stop til you all go home
So just do it, find a little cutie and move it
Here's your chance to dance, to find romance
And shake your pants and put you in a trance

The microphone maniacs and we don't need gats

Flex your minds over to the funk shelter
Catch wreck the techs of the hip-hop dwellers
We kick the wit to hit, flip, and rip your shit
If you're liquid, you'll get lit with
Funk for your trunk we reveal
Chumping those scrubs like a bear and they can't appeal kid
I see a lot from the funk in hip-hop
The rest get dropped like cops on a hot block

I changed the fame to claim my reign to claim the dames
Stop fronting fool, you know my name
M-E-L-E, I'm on the tele, you're jealy
Don't call me Mel, just call me Mele
A mister, teacher, preacher, tutor, pastor, call me bastion
The emcee ryhme line mine blast the butcher
Would you let the beat funk
You know I am who I am, it's cos I got that funk

Sit back and watch cable, put my feet in the table
Collecting royalty checks from my record label
So you see I've been around and I'm still down
And I'll always hold the crown, I'm the king on the scene

I've been on the scene since rap began
As a participant and not a fan

You think I am but they know because they had
Me in New York twenty six years ago
And my mom said when I was an embryo
She heard peculiar sounds and I was moving around
And when I made my way out, I was about seven pounds
Learned to use my lungs when I was young
Then I  on the lip from the tip of my tongue
And what's hard, I make sound easy because I'm too 
With the rhyme I'll make you have a good time
And I will fullfil your need, be it mental or erotic
When splurging like the Virgin Isles, I'm exotic
I'm professional and my profession pays
I'm Kurtis Blow and I'll always be the king on the scene",https://genius.com/Kurtis-blow-still-on-the-scene-1988-lyrics
