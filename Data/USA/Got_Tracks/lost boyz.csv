Renee,Legal Drug Money,1996.0,"Here's a tune about this honey named Renee that I met one day
On my way back from John Jay
I'm peeping shorty as she's walking to the train
I tap her on her shoulders
""Excuse me miss, but can I get your name?""
She said, my name is Renee
I said I got a whole lot to say, so may I walk you to your subway?
She said if you want, so yo, we started talking
I bought two franks and two drinks and we began walking
I had to see where that head was at cause her gear was mad fat
So we must chat about this and that
She told me what she was in school for
She wants to be a lawyer, in other words, shorty studies law
I'm telling shorty I'm a writer
And as she's looking for the token, she drops a package of the EZ Wider
Covers her mouth with her name ring
I said, yo don't sweat the technique, shorty rocks, I do the same thing
But yet I use Philly blunts
She said, ""I never dealt with Philly blunts
Because I heard that's for silly stunts""
I said nah they burn slower
Right now I really don't know ya
But maybe later on, I can get to show you

A ghetto love is the law that we live by
Day by day I wonder why my shorty had to die
I reminisce over my ghetto princess everyday
Give it up for my shorty
A ghetto love is the law that we live by
Day by day I wonder why my shorty had to die
I reminisce over my ghetto princess everyday
Give it up for my shorty

So now we sitting on the train
Besides her fingernails, now shorty got the hairdo of pain
Now understand she got flava
A tough leather jacket with some jeans and a chain that her moms gave her
Got off the train about 6:34
She wasn't sure she had grub for the dog, so we hit the store
Went to the crib and turned the lights on
A mad magazine stand
From Essence to Right On
A leather couch, stereo system with crazy CDs
Understand, kid, she got G's
She said Cheeks, do what you want
She said I'm gonna feed the dog
I said, alright well I'ma roll this blunt
She came back with stretch pants and a ponytail, a t-shirt
A yo, fam I got a tender-roni girl
We're sitting on the couch chatting
We're smoking blunts off the balcony
We're staring at Manhattan now
She started feeling on my chest
I started feeling on the breasts
And there's no need for me to stress the rest
A yo, I got myself a winner
We sparked a blunt before we ate and a blunt after we ate dinner
She had a tattoo she only wanted go to see
But first dim the lights and turn up the Jodeci
I'm like whatever, shorty rock, we can swing it like that
'Cause on the real this is where it's at

A ghetto love is the law that we live by
Day by day I wonder why my shorty had to die
I reminisce over my ghetto princess everyday
Give it up for my shorty
A ghetto love is the law that we live by
Day by day I wonder why my shorty had to die
I reminisce over my ghetto princess everyday
Give it up for my shorty

I woke up the next day on the waterbed
A letter's on the pillow and this what the letter said
It said, ""Cheeks, I'll be home around two
You was deep in your sleep so I didn't want to bother you""
I left my number for shorty to call me later
Got dressed, smoked a blunt, and then I bounced towards the elevator
I got a beep around three
I'm asking shorty what's up with you, she's asking what's up with me
And now we been together for weeks
Candlelight dinner with my shorty, crack a forty with my naughty freaks
Hey man, I never been in love
But every time I'm burstin' in and outta state, it's Shorty that I'm thinking of
I'm hanging out with my crew
I get a beep from Renee 
because Renee uses Code Two
But yet I'm chattin' with her mom dukes
She says ""Renee has been shot, so Cheeks, meet me up at St. Luke's""
I jumps on the Van Wyck, I gotta make it there quick
Ay yo , this shit is gettin' mad thick
Not even thinking about the po-nine
I'm doing a buck, who gives a fuck,
 
I'm smokin' boom and the whole nine
I gotta see what's going on
But by the time I reach the hospital, they tell me ""Mr. Cheeks, Renee is gone""
I'm pouring beer out for my Shorty who ain't here
I'm from the ghetto, so listen, this is how I shed my tears

A ghetto love is the law that we live by
Day by day I wonder why my shorty had to die
I reminisce over my ghetto princess everyday
Give it up for my shorty
A ghetto love is the law that we live by
Day by day I wonder why my shorty had to die
I reminisce over my ghetto princess everyday
Give it up for my shorty
A ghetto love is the law that we live by
Day by day I wonder why my shorty had to die
I reminisce over my ghetto princess everyday
Give it up for my shorty
A ghetto love is the law that we live by
Day by day I wonder why my shorty had to die
I reminisce over my ghetto princess everyday
Give it up for my shorty",https://genius.com/Lost-boyz-renee-lyrics

Mr. Cheeks
]
""The forecast: showers heavy at times with occasional thunderstorms today and a high of 89 degrees""
The cops said to me, ""yo kid""
""Partial clearing and a low of 74""
Damn! Kghhh!

Basically, kid
Word, Ren zone, wanna hit?
Queens!
This microphone I got some of this
You know how many member L.B. Tran, get motherfuckin' biz
Along your child, we got the funk Doctor Spot
Canibus and A+ from far-sized block
Yo, yo, yo, yo, Big Dog locks it down

Yo, we come through like bulls, see, ’cause niggas takin' two pulls and pass
Nigga, watch your back once you talk out your ass
I pack a .380 in my stash for protection
Family to raise, the world is acting crazed
I never thought I'd make it, it was hectic when I scrambled
On point like a knife, I'm takin' life as a gamble
Livin' in the rotten apple, yo where every core is rotten
All my niggas, rest in peace, ya see you gone but not forgotten
Now my main wifey, deaded shady chicks
Official Lost Boyz since the year of '86
And fuck these crooked niggas I could kill em with the passion
At times I feel like blastin' in Jamaican Queens fashion
You think you can fuck around, but kid you're just thinking
It's over when I'm sober, imagine when I'm drinking
Without blinking man, I'll tear your crew like pages
I’ll rip you from the backyards, parks and on stages

Yo, A+ the lyrically superb one, spittin' rhymes
Off the top of the tongue to burn ya ear drums
Rockin' shit, make the opposite team call a time out
Knocking niggas three times my size out
The crowd loves me, so when I ain't around they ask for me
I buckle up and catch wreck like a crash dummy
For the fast money, I get up in that ass money
The fact you tryna test me kinda bugs me
I leave crews fed up, like handicap niggas tryna get up
Emcees get wet up with lyrical gun pellets
I blow up the spot when it's time to rock
I speak out my voice box and peak out at a hundred watts
Who wanna cipher? I get dumb
Word to my mother, the father, the holy ghost, and Rev Run
When it's all said and done, I end the service
Concoctin' the type of verses average MC's seem to worship
[Interlude: Redman, 
Canibus
]
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, Big Dog! Turn the track off!
Fuck how you feel
Yo fake MC's, step to the rear!
Fuck how the lyrical skills get
Yo real MC's, bring this shit up north!

My style is Milk of Magnesia, clutch the five speed and bust
The more the merrier, secure the area
My La Familia is ultimate superior
We don't jack cars, we jack for aircraft carriers
I bounce like trampolines when I be blowing the fiends to pieces
Hem 'em like sewing machines and Jesus
When the shadows of the barrel pointing out my boy Camaro
I get punished like Pharaoh for splittin'
You're better off singin' Christmas carols for Christmas
Because I'm on point like bow and arrow equipment
The president of chicken head conventions
I give you a deluxe Ku Klux lynchin'
I got a headache from the stress, success, not wearing a vest
5-11 for being dirty and court's at 9:30
Yo, Mr.Cheeks, I made this bitch call police
She tried swallowing a nine piece, forgot the warranty on false teeth
I return like Makaveli on 18 inch Pirelli's
Assault and battery like my palms is Eveready
Sharp as machete's, matter of fact I slap for cognac, can the beef heavy

Canibus brings the sickest drama, fierce enough to pierce the thickest armor
I smack bitches who try to suck dick through a condom
Playing with the mic is something I won't do
My only concern when I approach you is to roast you
I smoke you and whoever you standing close to
And make every man in your crew deny that he knows you
Defeating niggas like Seagal Steven
Putting MCs in positions to prevent 'em from breathing
I'll make you question any and everything you've ever believed in
By peeping your deepest secrets like psychic readers
What's the matter with y'all?
I splatter y'all against the motherfucking wall with these raw lyrics I catapult
None of y'all got the balls big enough to battle
I go ""On and On"" like Erykah Badu
A hundred times nicer than the best is
Twice as arrogant as KRS is,
 who wanna test this?
Fuck y'all, you don't impress me and no one can test me
An MC so ill, I got AIDS scared to catch me
All that shit you popping will stop when I put you in a headlock
And apply pressure until I crush your motherfucking noggin
I grab mics and push niggas to the left
So fast their hearts end up on the right side of their chests
My hypothesis is that nobody can see this
Lyrical genius, I got it sown like a seamstress
But if you want to battle, I'm down
If you got nine lives, I'll take eight of them off your hands right now
Step up and get your neck cut from ear to ear
If you survive, then you can cover your scar with a beard
I'm the illest from Queens to the new Jerusalem briddicks
Anyone who ain't feeling my shidick can suck my didick
You need to quit it, if you ain't spittin'
More than fifty bars per minute 'cause you ain't in lyrical fitness
Kicking boring raps with metaphors that's wack
All of y'all motherfuckers need NordicTrack
To get ya weight up, fuckin' with Canibus you get ate up
Get beat down and sprayed up, just for bringing my name up
Been rocking longer than niggas twice my age
Back in the days before Bob Marley was rockin' a fade
Before Honest Abe signed the paper that freed slaves
Before Neanderthals was drawing on walls in caves
I existed, in the garden of Eden gettin' lifted
Sticking dick to Eve before she was Adam's mistress
Before Christ created Christmas, I been in lyrical fitness
The Canibus is spitting till he's spitless
Fifty bars of total sickness, you won't forget this
I'm putting every wack Emcee alive on my shit list
Verbally vicious, telekinetically gifted
Took you a minute to exhibit that I'm sick wit it
Now you tell me who you think is damaging shit
Going once, going twice, sold to that nigga named Canibus
Me and Mr. Cheeks, A+, and Funk Doctor
Hopping out the Huey copter to suey chop ya

Me and My Crazy World,"Love, Peace & Nappiness",1997,"Now I'm in love with these two chicks
I don't know which one to pick
My feelings for them both are getting thick
Now am I wrong cause I don't want to lose none of them
Am I confused cause I don't want to chose one of them
It's no doubt I think about my honeys everyday
It's no question I show my honeys love in every way
Possible I once took my shorty to the hospital
She cut that hand on glass plus I love that ass
Short and sexy lips always wet see
I go downtown cause it's fresh plus she lets me
Rub it the right way like Johnny Gill would say
I'm glad you feel that way sometimes we just chill and lay
In the sack I rub her back when we're resting
It was love at first sight my confession
She know who she is can't say her name
Cause if I do I won't be true to my game
Word up

I can't escape this life that I'm living
I'm in the mix I'm in love with two women
That's word to Moms
I got two honeys on my arms and I don't want to let none of them go
Yo I can't escape this life that I'm living
I'm in the mix I'm in love with two women
That's word to Moms
I got two honeys on my arms and I don't want to let none of them go

Now, my next one she lives out of state
I mean the sex and conversation situation is great
Everytime I hit town we make a date
And when it's time to chill my shorty can't wait
Now I can still remember when we first met eachother
Exchanged numbers promised we won't forget eachother
Goes to work and school
That's cool
No doubt that's why a nigga went that route
No form foot locker
Shorty lookin proper
She's out to get me can't stop her
Know I had a lover
Yo still went for her
Even copped a bed and kicks on the strength of her
Yo chatted talkin bout see you later
From that moment on I knew that I had to date her
Couldn't conversate long
Shorty had to go back to work
Something inside said that will work


I thought I couldn't live with chicks cause they be too demanding
Especially the ones that's never understanding, like
Who was that? Where you goin? Who you out with?
Them same niggas I make moves and I shout with
Don't let these niggas in the street gash your head up
Like they can do better than me
Plus I'm fed up
I had to tell my main chick that one time
Thinking to me short
She thought that I'm
Some clown nigga she can scream on and talk to
I had to run her down the line this ain't no walk through
Now who the fuck you think you talking to chick
Your complaining's making me sick
Understand man I tried to do my thing
Yo understand I played the puppet on the string
Like I say everyday be careful my friend
Good things always come to an end
So yo


See the moral of this is that I really do care
But I'm not afraid to go there
Very unselfish and yes I do share
You could have your bitch but you gets nowhere
Word, she began by saying try after try
It's a done deal
Now I'm singing bye bye
All I tried to do was keep you satisfied
Never dealing with no others I try
Too many threats kid, gotta let her go
Always in your corner
Got to let her know
As I grab my coat and painfully walked out
Hands about to give, we talked out
I'm feeling pain as it came to an end
I said to shorty I will always be your friend
Now if you ever need me I will be right there
I ain't going nowhere, for real",https://genius.com/Lost-boyz-me-and-my-crazy-world-lyrics

She's got problems, got problems
Three thousand problems, got problems)
It's a cool summer night
My .44's on my waist gotta half a stick of dynamite
Got some beef wit some niggas across town
Keep my man to the ground
I gotta shut it down, they pull up on my block
I'm in my little brown hooptie
So they guess I want the white rock
They walk close towards my ride
Surprise motherfucker it's a hit from the South side

I put two to his head
I jumped on the southern state then I'm rushin out to Hempstead
One down and one to go
I heard the next nigga's on and he's gotten a ball of dough
I kick in the nigga's door
I slap the nigga in the jaw wit my nickel played .44
And word up ya'll shoulda saw
The way this nigga hit the floor when the Freaky got raw
Some bitch tried to burst but I shot her in the back
BAH! Aiyyo Money where your stash at?
He took me back inside to this room
Beside the safe full a G's he had mad bags of boom
1.. 2.. 3.. thousand problems

He said, ""Taliq, whats up my man?""
I got this nigga locked down wit my joint to his gut
And word up he got an mail press
Aiyyo Money what's this address?
1245 Boulevard Queens, and and tell my man they try to caravan
Understand I'm on a mission

And get some Phillies from the store

They arrived here on the double
Money beggin on repeat yo he don't want trouble, I told Lou to move the chairs
Aiyyo Cheeks, help me take this dead bitch down the stairs
I come back up for the session
Money still tied the fuck up confessin
I blow some smoke into his eyes, here nigga
Take two more puffs before you die
Yo, I stood up, about-faced him
And yo Lost Boyz waste him (BAH BAH)
And yo Queens waste him (BAH BAH), and yo Southside waste him (BAH BAH)
1..2..3.. thousand problems
(Who got problems
Pretty Lou and the whole motherfuckin world
I got problems)
It's 3 o'clock in the mornin
Shit is on motherfucker shit is on
Yeah yeah, I gotta get this nigga Shawn
I'm drivin in a stolen car wit no motherfuckin lights on
I heard Shawn got crazy ends
But before I do this thing I go and pick up my best friends
A forty ounce and lead feels right
I got this hit up on Hillside (Hillside)
Understand now he's a gonner
I roll all my windows down pull my shit on the corner
But I still bein' sneaky
(What's your name?) Cause I'm freaky Taliq, I'm freaky Taliq
But right now I got beef wit this nigga named Shawn
Shit is on word is bond money is gone
He's wit his bitch in bed (ah ah)
I pulled out my .44, but I don't put it to his head
Cause this shit is too easy (even though)
Even though he can go in one squeeze G, it's it's it's crazy

Shorty c'mere baby girl! (I like what I see)

And we call this one for all y'all, who be going to buy...

The cheebas, them liquors
The condoms, hit the ass
It's the cheebas, the liquors
The condoms, that ass

Now now now
Met this girl, just the other day
When I was up, on Rockaway
She was in Kennedy Fried (word em up)
A little kill's breast, and I said, ""Excuse me Miss...
Maybe we can go and jus chat."" ""About what?""
""About, about this about that.""
I bet I put somethin in yo mind
To make you heel it up bring it back come rewind
Now I'm, just a rap artist
Not sayin that I'm the best not the smartest but
But I come up wit things ya never seen
Things you never heard of like money and the murder like
Next thing you know we in the rest
Drinkin liqour, puffin on the buddha sess
I threw on me a Rough Rider
I slid inside her

Wit my cheebas, my liquors
My condoms, hit the ass
I had the cheebas, them liquors
The condoms, hit the ass
We had the cheebas, the liquors
The condoms, hit the ass
We had the cheeba, the liquor
The condom, the ass!!
[Verse 2: Freaky Tah
Don't be fuckin wit my shorty, sippin on her forty
Or puffin on her blunt, cuz she's no fuckin stunt
True to the game, goes to school for her edu-ma-cation
While I bounce around the nation
From nation and back to New York
I twist the cap, pop the cork
And take a long walk to the court
Buddha, I spark chill wit my crew
Who it be Mr. Cheeks when I sip my nigga brew
And get in, you gets the fan understand
Bouncin, we gets to buzzin forty ouncin
Hit Virginia, I get the shorty-shorty
Sippin on the forty on the corner wanna bone
In home or out on my own
I get whatever hit her, and then get rid of her
After I'm done with it, my man, he wanna get with it
Then he hit it from da back, now my crew wanna hit it
But me Freaky Tah, trip off and I creep
Niggas they be buggin, but don't ever peep my style
My crew is buckwild
We been in this game for awhile

Smokin cheebas, the liquors
The condoms, the ass
It's the cheebas, them liquors
The condoms, the ass (repeat 3X)
[Verse 3: Mr. Cheeks
Now before you run up in that
Wear your mutha poke-pro-fa-lac
Tick, before you run up in skinz
Before you bone, run your mouth to yo mens
Make sure that you protect yourself
That shows that you respect yourself
Now don't violate your skin and your balls
You'll be making, the phone call
See Dr. Abraham or them condoms now
You know that you best to be aware
Don't go bustin up and nuttin in
Let a nigga from the Lost Boyz tell ya somethin
No man know he play he the fuckin game
But AIDS ain't got no fuckin name
All you chancy niggas that's playin cute
Don't jump, without a parachute

Yeah here we go as I shoot from the top of the key
The Lost Boyz in the house with the Capital P
Grab a chair relax and pass the Alize
I'mma tell you a little somethin about this chick around my way
She was a dime with a brown skin complexion
She looked so good you'd think you wouldn't need protection
Girlfriend was top choice selection...
...around in every section
They got twisted, she said no condom so he risked it
Caught in the mix and now you sick kid
Word is bond, I thought by now you learned your lesson
Fucking around with no protection
So emphasize this, stressin the point, and analyze this
Don't get caught, with the virus

Channel Zero,Legal Drug Money,1996,"Intro:
Ayo, yeah niggas
I'm talking to all y'all hard rock niggas
Let y'all niggas know that I understand
What niggas is really going through, ya understand?
Motherfucking down to they last cent
Smoking looseys
Thinking up shit to do, doing stick ups and shit
Busting at niggas, murdering niggas
Getting bullshit ass money
What if that was your peoples you murdering clown?
It's wild
Shout out to grandpa, you know what I'm saying?
Shout out to grandpa kelly
My man Ralou's brother little Devin
Ya know I'm saying, Freaky Taliq's moms, rest in peace
Know I'm saying?
Everybody wanna live the ill life, know I'm saying?
But yo we trying to live it like love, peace and nappiness
You know I'm saying? word up
Verse 1
I'm growing up in the ghetto
And there was nobody happy
And my head is mad nappy and
I'm thinking up a way that I can get some dough
Man I'm trying to blow
But yet this record shit is so slow
I got the whole family on my back
All I do is eat and sleep
Run the street with that ill pack
You know them Lost Boyz guys
With Timbs and jeans
Field jackets, and hats covering the eyes
But listen, that's how it is
If you don't dig how I live
Motherfuckas mind ya biz!
Cause everyday on the street
The black man is getting beat
Police line us up on the concrete
Now people look at me
And always see wrong
A new problem everyday
I'm trying to be strong
Now how strong can a nigga be
When the blacks is locked down
And the Wghite man's got the key
It's getting harder day after day
Somebody gots to pay
And in my closet lays an AK
A newborn is found dead
Plus money killed the girl
And put the gun to his own head
You never hear this on the 6:00 news
When my niggas get killed in the street over tennis shoes
It's hard as hell for us Blacks to earn cash man
The homeless keep warm by setting fire to a trash can
Now everyday I need ends
Newports, my nigga weed
St. Ides is my best friend
Pop's is broke
No calls coming in on my phone
And money I'm down to my last stone
My mom dukes is always banging on my door
My music's too loud
I got clothes on the floor (pick 'em up)
She doesn't understand
I'm cruising in the fast lane
I'm fresh out of nerves, Ma
You're working on my last vein
Now how can I explain
That I don't wanna take her out
But that's stuck in my brain
We're having fight after fight
Because I leave when it's bright
And come skunked up the next night
But that's the life that I live, understand me
It's bad enough that Po-Nine tried to can me
Ayo my lifestyle's rough
I got three sisters, four brothers
Man, 8 is enough
But yet I gots no hero
But I got the 4-1-1 on the ghetto

I live in Queens, New York (and what you do?)
I twist a cap with my niggas
Smoke a blunt let's start to talk
About this ill situation
That us blacks is in
It's time we build a better nation
Motherfuck them police
Some whites talk about peace
Others treat us like beasts
But they ain't ready for the planet
Marky Mark be talking that slang
But he don't even understand it
Yea I said Marky Mark
Fronting like the buddah is sparked
I never seen you in the park
You gets awards for your bullshit skills, G
A White boy acting black, that shit kills me
Pants sagging, talking slang kid and all that
I never seen you in the project's hall, black
Ayo, I wants no Grammy
Ya whiteys gave Elvis a stamp
And what ya plan to give my man Sammy?
The Klu can get a Klan but the Blacks gets one month
And every year, what the fuck is that there?
Now you're best to disappear
The Black Planet is near
Four cops dismissed down in L.A.?
Now what the fuck are y'all telling me?
There's no justice, understand man, there's just us
The only time we stick together is when the Whites rushed us
Yeah, I'm beefing with you Blacks
Cause only on racial attacks is when we walk in packs
We need to stick together daily, understand?
Cause I got more reasons than Philip Bailey, man
Ayo, us Blacks need to get the facts right
Cause hey it's only right when the Whites see us Blacks fight
And in the street, niggas fight over concrete

Tec to the sky see how mom's is always bitchin'
I'm done buffin' got my cheese my pen & paper

It's my nigga Spigg Nice he tellin' me he in the zone
Yo I got the liquor the grain fool let's make a tape
I'm caught up in my own zone can't really escape
I ran it down the line as Easy Mo played the song
He checked my five he said to me yo later on
About an hour passes
About my loosey deuce deuce & my tinted glasses
I got the bike that I copped from my younger cousin
Cause that cat is up in class like a nickel & he wasn't
I'm concentratin' on these moves that I'mma soon be makin'
And once I break then I'mma show my peeps that I'm not fakin'
See my man Pop or Die from the block
Niggas wearin' ? reverse as we handle barred it to the block
See certain situations happen
When you caught up in the 'hood in the game of rappin'
You see scrappin' now leads to cappin'

Walked to the back now let me get a four
Exit from the spot everybody know what's hot

Which one of y'all think you ill enough to bust with Plus?
Get crushed by the stampede of the elephant tusks
We LB families, niggas don't understand us;
Lyrical scanner, diagnosin' niggas with cancer
You got a problem, I got the answer:
Twin Glocks goin' bananas, buckin' innocent bystanders, son
The total sum is a mathematical function;
I used to get suspended for keepin' the class jumpin'
At the blackboard with the chalk in my hand;
Mr. Cheeks snatchin' leaves off the Canibus plant
Watch the crowd get amped while they scream and chant;
It's ill how they can't keep still like a fire drill
We desire mills from 9-7 until
Firin' high-caliber steel on this battlefield, son ...

Parkside is my Crew
Lost Boyz is my Crew
Group Home is my Crew
Everyone is my Crew
Reebok's my Crew

Strictly out for the fortune and fame, I entertain for my personal gain;
Rockin' gold chains big enough to cause neck pains
Canibus is my name, I be the last one to set it;
You could find my name in the Lost Boyz album credits
If you open up and look at the cover
You'll see cop-killin' Queens in this motherfucker
And we all represent the Group Home click:
L-O-S-T B-O-Y-Z for the 9-6
And as the clock ticks, record sales climb;
I remember when them niggas first got signed
Fuckin' with Uptown, bustin' they ass e'ryday;
From ""Lifestyles"" to ""Jeeps"" to ""Renee.""
Now they gettin' mad airplay all over New York

But hard work produces results
And I'mma keep rockin' 'til the day somebody stops my pulse

Shit is getting ill, cuz we the microphone wrath

Now for years, I've been trying to show the skills (show ya skills, nigga!)
So I can do my thing with wifey and start knocking on some bills and then
My peoples in the headlight yo (blaow!) so innocent
Mr. Cheeks, yeah (a real nigga reprsenting now)
I lived out in Queens, man, for years (hah!)
I'm seeing ya brothers killing brothers, man, that means (more tears)
Every day I'm trying and I'm seeing my niggas dying
And I'm asking mom dukes (why you crying)
I got a little man, my little man is getting older
I wipe my wifeys eyes, every time she cries, as I hold her
It's tough coming up as a young black man
Understand, see the world is ran by the Klan
Just like Tom and Jerry with cheese
And they seem to lock us down when they bring in the keys
Well I guess that's the way that is (what?)
It's time for Mr. Cheeks and Lost Boyz to get biz
And get this Legal Drug Money


I seen this nigga went crazy on the train
At first I thought he was nuts but at the same time I feel the pain
Cuz another niggas dead on the street over dope shit
Like nigga where you run shit?
It bothers me on the norm, I stand tall
With my back against the wall, and my hand on my four-four
(Mr. Cheeks: Aiyo, what about the world, Tah?)
The world seems to bug me
Don't know who wants to kill me
Don't know who wants to love me
Man, listen, I be keeping peace in my heart
But if shit hit the fan, I rip shit apart
I'm not with the beef and emotion, I'd rather smoke chom
And dump a fat bong around the ocean
I maintain keep my self up to par
Got no appetite for it, cuz every critic like a falling star
And on the real, kid, it ain't nothing funny
Freaky Tah, LB Fam, '94, Legal Drug Money


You say it's 94, I warm it up and give it to ya raw
You say you wanna battle well prepare for the war
I shuffle up and break them down cuz we catch 'em with the quickness
My name is Mr. Cheeks and Mr Cheeks is next to sickness
In the dictionary, I will bury any MC
With violence, my crew or even try to go against me
For real, I'd rather push an Ac' with some rims
And bounce around Queens with some baggy jeans and Timbs
And chill, puff on a Phil' at will
I got a baby boy to skill, it's so much to keep it real
Relax, I got a style smoother than a Saxon
I looked into the mirror, say it clear than the Jackson
Guy did, who shot the sheriff? Nigga, I did
Where you from, Mr. Cheeks? Southside, kid
Yo, on the real, man, it ain't nothing funny
'94, '95, '96, Legal Drug Money, chill


Give it up, come out ya fucking pockets
Put ya face to the ground, how do that sound?
Go pound for pound, letting off a shot

Straight from Da Ghetto,Legal Drug Money,1996,"The rap skills they flow just like water from a faucet
I been here from Queens, thought I lost it
Well I've been waiting, hibernating
It's mad peoples eyeing on the streets, so with the streets I'm debating, see
The government is one some ill skit
That's why my peoples sling rocks, they bust shots, either kill, kid
So yo, we need to face the fact, black
Once a fellow blows from the ghetto, see there's no turning back
My mom dukes needs she need some loot, I can't seed it
That's why I do my thing here, so I can be there
I'm on this lane, and I'm talking from the slum
Cuz the Cheeks is from the slum and from the slum is here I come
Aiyo, I thought I'd give it to ya
Peoples try to hold the fam back because they felt we couldn't do it
Aiyo, I live out in the gutter
Now you see how long it takes for Cheeks to make butter
Coming straight from the ghetto

Aiyo, I come from the ghetto, I live for the ghetto
I even cry for the ghetto
Aiyo, I might have a verse for the ghetto
That means I might have to die for the ghetto

The rough times will remain in my brain
I make it hard to maintain, tearing clowns out the frame
I been away for mad peoples thought I fell
But I just came back from my visit in hell
I seen the demon and we chatted, about this and that
And other foul things that never mattered
He said it's time to get ya props
But still watch ya back from jealous fellas and them crooked type cops
So yo I did what he got it, police never reported
The day they found my little man Shawn snorted
Some kids slit his throat for a little coke
But we caught the suspect, 911 is a joke
But listen that's how it goes on the street, man
You can't be beat, us real fellas gotta eat
With selling drugs, busting shots, how local thugs
Money we divided, now they works under works from the ghetto


I represent for the borough of Queens
Getting out of state money, hang on Uptown scenes
I hit the Bronx just to boogie with my aunts
Then I burst out to Brooklyn, haven't been there in months
I see the crews, smoking blunts, drinking bew
It'll be for my cousin Lou, I'm out about two
Right now I push a napsack, with some Timbs
But I'm soon to push a black Ac' with deep dish rims
Yo, Big Dex hits me off with the fat beats
Rest in Peace to Tyrone from the back streets
Our God, won't press in fiend time
My nigga named Chris and big Craig why they die?
Aiyo, I can't forget the shorty, her name was Ebony
She got smoked in 40 and it made mad noise

At times it makes me wanna holla, when I'm down to my last dollar bill
We keepin' it real, see, that's the only way to keep it
See I'm a legal drug thug getting Legal Drug Money so peep it
Back in the days when we used to hear about the square
I heard alotta bodies used to get caught up by shotties there
And out in 40 where Ebonishah got killed
And I be like playing cuz it feel
So much envy, got to kill a man if he comes
Fear my path... shout outs to the J wrath
And the whole LB staff

It's all right

Ass in the pool and the fools gettin sparked
I feel higher, level, nigga, they roll with the devils

Chilling with my niggas, I'm quick to pull triggers

When it's on, so welcome into my zone
It's Dex coming into your home
And then I, blends in with tones
That makes ya knees buckle and numbs ya back bone

That means I just flew in from Queens
To earn my presidents by any means
Cuz my third eye and me and my society is firing me
You see beef, you can't defy the G in it's entirety

So earning bread, my eyes of though with red'll bop ya heads up

You know the lifestyle, plain and simple, out to get it
It's ghetto game us niggas play no doubt we stay commited
And capable to bring the hot shit, no matter what
And where we aim, we do our thing to bring the fatter cut
See my succession based on strugglin and hard times
And boulevard dimes been with boulevard crimes
It kept me on my feet, and cuz these playa haters hate us
Off and on and on the court, because we make threes and twos
You bound to dues, once she fuck around with raw shit
No bullshittin still hittin you with more shit
My yellowness don't mean a nigga when I broadcast
Yo you don't want my skills to get in your ass
I've seen alot come and go but I'mma stay here
I get my heat up in the street cuz they don't play fair
I'm tryin to keep it level headed but it's really hard
When niggas tryin to take what I be gettin, feel me god?

LB Fam bring the shit that's hot
Besides that we risin to the top
There's no way to stoppin us

Time to make cakes, no time for the bullshit

From underneath the spleef, black bandana, Yankee fitted
For those that wanna nigga, come and get it
A rap skills official, bring my ghetto mix to any session
Straight finessin tracks, no question
Gotta feel good, risin to the top, started from the bottom
Like revenge, gettin niggas when you spot em
Got my shit ready, niggas gettin gased like Getty

Increase my pay from the way that I flow

Late night creepin plus we keepin eyes low
Aiyo again, it's in between the lap, I kick the rap
On the highway, bouncin if it's Friday
My g sleen back, represent the backstreets
Besides that, we got the tight rap and phat beats
Aiyo my man Sexxx, plug me in it's on again
Head south, reach Cali right it's on again
It's LB Fam, understand, right or wrong my friend?
We gotta keep it strong, don't know when it's all or end

Keep it Real,Legal Drug Money,1996.0,"Yo believe I paid the dues man I started in the game
With my mans on linden and the van we drinking ghetto champagne
Slinging rocks and packing Glocks on the blocks
It's early in the morning I'm selling tumbs from my reeboks
Tres nicks and dimes I write rhymes
But the ghetto times they got the Cheeks doing crimes
The street life yeah that's the only life I know
Where niggas sling rocks bust shots and push yayo
Sit on crates keep their backs against gates
Every man is insane he's got a brain like Norman Bates
Timberland boots ski hats we pack gats
Carry across town because we tapping niggas hoodrats
But they don't want the fam' listen
See a south side Jamaica Queen fellas get down man
Listen so what your crew is x-rated
Peoples if you violate you getting violated

Come on and keep it real; this is saying
That the Lost Boyz and Group Home fam' want it all what would you do?
And if you feel that you'se a real soldier from the street
Throw your hand in the air we salute you
Bouncin' Uptown bounce it down south
Bouncin' bouncin' Uptown bounce it down south

I had a messed up childhood the head is mad nappy
I need money in a snap gee kid I'm trying to blow like papi
Fat cat the street life is where it's at
Peeling caps so yo we got to stay strapped
Terrified cause the crew from the south side is bustin
No question
I keep my hear in braids Taliq got dreads
Hangin out in the reds wearing Levis and Pro-keds
Pouring beer on the curb for the dead
I had to bring drama to some niggas out in Hempstead
(Freaky TAH)
Hey yo cut the music down
Yo half the world thought the album failed in this 94 and its on..

I'm smoking weed in 96' with my peeps
Jetting from the police cause police they'se a bunch of creeps
Testing off the new burners in the park
We sleep during the day and creep when it's dark
I once had to cry when I seen Tyrone die
This black on black crime I cram to understand why
Baby girls having kids in their teens
Young fellas baggy jeans slinging crack to the crack fiends
That's the type of lifestyle that I lead
With my fams on the corner drinking beers and smoking weed
Yo believe I been through all the struggles and the pain
I'm ripping out my hairs and I can't get to my brain
I want the gold teeth and chains
I hustle with Timberland boots and rainsuits when it rains
Fools makin' moves pay dues
Give up your cheese you loose my baby boy need shoes
Stepping to the Cheeks you made an error
You been to the ""house of pain"" now welcome to my yard of terror
What you think I'm some sucka
Word to him I stomp you out with my Timb chukkas
Who who you stepping to the Lost Boyz crew
Boy get stomped that ass is through


See we live the street life
Smoking blunts with the wife stay on point like a ....fuckin knife
Every day on rockaway is getting hotta
I can't do what a wanna I do what I gotta
Survive I might not be around in '95
See I was taught young to be strong and just strive
So nowadays we packing guns
We actin' grimy hills for funds and I stash all my sons mons
A little man to look after
Taking rap as a joke but I see no laughter
To man Charles Suitte and Big Tig in Atlanta and Va.....",https://genius.com/Lost-boyz-keep-it-real-lyrics

You wanna run around ho'in witcha friends
Hay that nigga Cheeks ain't got no ends

A nigga from the southside
A shorty from the Springfield High ]from the Springfield
Shorty lookin fly right Tah? (woo)

Cuz see my bobo's mad strong
I never thought twice
That my wife would do wrong
I see her all the time
She's always home when I call her
I feel like a million bucks
Takin flicks at the mall

Cuz it only took a minute
For another to run in it
Had the..birds and the bees
Lemonade and iced tea
Man I went all out with ease
She was my main squeeze
Tell me....
Chorus
Verse 3

Now shorty rock, she had a nigga on lock
Used to bring her friends through
To meet my mans on the block
And everything seemed love love yo
Shorty was the one I was thinkin of so
Whenever I used to listen to rumors
I would hit em till my man pulled me near
Put a bug in my ear
Listen shorty over there
Wit the smile it be foul
Just in a little while
Seen her on the Isle
Wit another kid, who just came home from a bid
He grabbed on that ass
All hugged up in front the crib.....
See what Im sayin
Bitches dont' appreciate nuthin man
2 dollar bitches wit 3 dollar haircuts yo know...
Chorus
Outro: Mr. Cheeks
Have you ever me a girlie

We Got That Hot Shit,LB IV Life,1999,"Hey yo
Let's see these niggas gummin'
Since '86 we had the streets hummin
I bet these niggas never seen it coming
Every days a crisis
Seems like paying dues, is paying prices
It's time to show these niggas who's  the nicest with
These rap devices
We keeps nothin but the chicks up in the cypher
For ya suckers catchin this is the cypa
Rumor sneakin, rise and shine
Plus niggas count cheddar
We see y'all niggas bouncin kid, but yet we bounce better
On the stoop, we drinking Guiness, rollin' up the bat
Freestyle the tracks, hit the parties up and back
Money comes in stacks, I guess we movin on up now
So what's up now?
Ghetto superstars, rhymes of the foreign year
Should we be spittin and be hittin niggas far and near
Basically my skills is vicious
I push a '99 Savan, while you stand around and look suspicious
Chorus 2X:
We got that hot shit
Straight from/of the block shit
And when we rock kid
We blow your spot kid

Yo I was born to be a trouble maker
That's what they said, I be in jail for gettin all this paper
Or probaly dead niggas a hate ya, even chips will snake ya
A little bread will make a motherfucka turn you in
Right to the feds
Try me and watch, get knocked, I'm lyin to cops
Advance, born to bridick kept supplyin the spots
All my niggas in the streets know
I'm not the one, I pack a gun and let the heat blow
It's deep though
I want my whole team to see dough
And even though we got to live with steel we heat po
We gotta get it, I do this for fun
I do this for my ones, I do this with guns
So be neutral and run
And in the process if I get knocked, fuck my pops
Give my mom and seed all I got
My loyalty is all I got from my family

It's be them real life ghetto shit
Be couple grounds, listen close while niggas run it down
Games not to be played, '99 straight chips, hot chicks
We got no time for these dicks

Burn trees, drink hennecy
When I die you'll remember me
So when I'll die you'll remember me
This be some real life ghetto shit

Niggas thinkin shit is sweet
But I ain't with too much talkin, I'mma let my heat speak
And don't get caught asleep with some with a freak
Cuz the chicks I deal with give me everything cheap, chief

I hear them talkin, we push the whips and still walkin
Yo this nigga done, cousin stick a fork in him
Try to warn him, my little brother and they team they
Had to run up on him
A new asshole, they chon him

These chicks opened up they cheeks, deep note they meat
Whatever, they play for keeps just to keep some fresh feet
The streets, we from the streets, we gotta hold heat
No matter where we go, never know if we got beef

Aiyo, niggas on the streets, nobody speaks
But when it's showtime, they on line, che che che che
Listen, nigga play your position
You was glisten, when a nigga like me had no pot to piss in

Yo I feel you god, this rap life shit is really hard
I spent my money at the bar, but I still be large
Charge cards, your garage for my truck
My cellys off the nuts, yo Cheeks wake the fuck up!

Yo fuck the dumb shit, we spit official slum shit
Yo what the fuck, is that the best a nigga come with
I love the night life, a gift to soak my right rhymes
I got a pint of henny backwards and a light dime

And I know that it hurts Cheeks, I love my niggas
So my niggas come first Cheeks, you feel me son?
Fuck the trips, fuck the whips and exotic women
Let's stack the dough so we can see ya niggas out of prison
We miss 'em
Chorus

Aiyo these niggas wanna outline us
What's the deal god, they hard to find us
Be prepared to feel my nine bust
Took my brother from me, aiyo you know how deep the slum be
But youse afraid to even come see

Ghetto and grimy, with chicks with Timbs
The streets are dims, the heats on hits
The freak are pimps, the hood livin
Where bummy niggas gotta lie to dough
I'm not a pimp, but I still gotta buy them hoes

Take a cold heart jeans, surrounded by the crack heads and dope fiends
The type of no hope seems, life stays in the mix
Rather be judged by twelve, then carried by six
I need the fix

Chicks so intimited, cause I'm not innovative
Hey yo, they mad cuz I made it, I'm glad that they hate it
Blow them away, coin toss, throw her away
Put your clothes on trick, nobody told you to stay, bitch!
Chorus

My hot outta stay drips
Lead the hot outta stay chicks
The shorty named toots push the six
Love to shake her shimmy, seen her one night, me and Bimmy
Aiyo some more she wanna give me?

And you can catch me in the city spinnin
5 A.M., window crack with my teeth grinnin
With the sight, straight livin
While I'm lookin at these pretty women
Crossin the light, they lookin at me
Like this niggas winnin, I know they hate me

Once again it's on, official burn out
Don't look, puzzled ???? faces how it turn out
Once in a while I take the train just to clear the brain
People ask me 'what's the deal kid, it's just the same'
You know the night-runners, nothin major
Don't let me and my bullshit invade ya
I know you probably, got problems of ya own
No need for you to zone
Understand, I love this game, it mean a great deal to me
It's my life, can you image how it feel to be?
(Hook)
I remember when there was no pots to piss in
It don't even to start me to reminiscin
About the past when we wasn't gettin no cash
Had the skills, but like a hot chick wit no ass
It meant nada, I gotta get my gid on
I need some chedda in my pocket, hot shit on
The lifestyle'll be butter like the wife's smile
Make a habit, don't break, it may take a while
I'm a hustla, I'mma hustle til the end, too
Starin at that, evil that us men do
Basically it's LB fam all night
And ain't nothin wrong doin it all night

From My Family To Yours (Dedication),"Love, Peace & Nappiness",1997,"VERSE 1 - Mr. Cheeks
This be a message to the ghetto when will this shit stop
We lost 2 ill niggas B.I.G and 2pac
This goes to all of us so peep the session from your nigga
You can be loved by millions but one clown can pull the trigga
See you aim to get bigger they break for your downfall
Your life is how you living kid just give it your all
We strive to be the best that's what they taught us in the rhyme
Smoking weed and getting bent we've all been through hard times
Much respect to your hood love is love that's all good
The plan's to make you niggas understand, understood
Yo here's the deal for real you can't get killed from entertaining
But that's all we know cause from the street we got the training
CHORUS
This be a ghetto dedication from my family to yours
How hard is this to explain when it rains kid it pours
Instead of bringing ?crime ills? and senseless wars
You niggas need to expand, buy land, open stores
You talk of revolution but you're very much afraid
Take that chip off your shoulder let's all get paid
Direct it to the world because we all need peace
We all livin in the belly of the beast
VERSE 2 - Mr. Cheeks
Yo, now many lives are lost still to this day we ask the reason
All the suffering we've been through niggas still is into squeezing
Mom dukes on welfare ghetto love no more we share
You rising to the top but then get hit from the rear
One night up in the hood I found my own self thumpin
Cause niggas out there they felt that I owed them something
Talk behind my back they don't attack that don't offend me
A 13-year old could just up, and end me
If he wanted to, blunted with the brew in his hand
Now does that make shorty rock the man?
Not only in your hood but in my hood we lost 2 good fellaz
It's more than what they motherfuckers tell us
Now if a cop got shot someone's caught the same night
That's the bullshit you motherfuckin right
So take heed to what I say, LB Fam pray in they own way
To the motherfuckin day
CHORUS
VERSE 3 - Queens Most Wanted
2 of the illest rap artists underground bodies slain
They both did they thing went platinum in the game
At home where I zone there's a TV I watch
BET, MTV, video, music box
It bugs me out for real I'm in the zone kid that's ill
It only goes to show up in the rap game it's real
It's just a little something on my mind how I feel
Now niggas kick raps, and caps get peeled
Kid I thought we was rhymin man fuck that actin tough
Enough is enough let's dead that East and West stuff
I'm callin niggas bluff yo my rap game be tuff
Let's take it to the stage and let the lyric game buss
I'm tryin to live a hundred plus in this crazy world
To hold down my fam, Queens, and my baby girl
Look here we tryin to make it but they tryin to hold us back
That's why I'm speakin my opinion on this track
The media they tryin to throw dirt in the game
But me and my fam we found ways to explain
Throughout the pain I try to gain and keep the shit the same
It's quite strange how these cats keep playin games

Da Game,Legal Drug Money,1996.0,"I needs dough, you needs dough
We needs dough, so yo

Put on my thinking cap and wrote a rap
About the niggas getting out of state trap, living that, yo what's up black?
Well it's my third day home and not a cent to my name
No jobs to claim, I'm back in the drug game
I need some money in a hurry, I'm saying
My baby boy Troy he'll be two next February
I'm in the crib with my man, my nigga Van Dam
And we thinking of an out of state plan, peep it
My man Roller Dough, fired up on Friday
Cuz buying an Ac' and bounce on the on the highway
Now Friday comes moms is beefing cuz I'm cursing
She smells cheeb' on me, I'm a whole different person
Well I kiss her on the cheek, she understood the chat
'Now call me when you get there, and tell me where you at'
Well all right, ma, checked out on my niggas, then we jetted
With fifty balls a piece, war and peace for unleaded
Smoke blunts, forty ounce and G and me bouncing
This is how we do, we the Lost Boyz, we in the game

The bitches, the money, the cars, we in the game

Jeans in a hurry, gonna blow
For 46 balls a piece, and each gotta owe
In the trunk, punk, we bouncing to Jamaica, Queens, funk
And inside the blunt, want 21 skunk
We headed for the belly and we entering the mouth
My niggas in the half, black, and yo, we headed south
Now that don't look right, but listen, black, we ight
We blasting coppers in the face in case the coppers crashing light
And smoking blunts by the boxes, ghetto champagne is chilled
Stopped at the first Big Boys for gas and the mill
Now everybody's looking at them niggas from New York
With Phil' jackets on and they peep as we talk
I say to Pretty Lou, look where Roller Dough's at
I want one of them shits by the time we gets back
We got the gas, saved a mil on the road, once again
Tahleek's on the blunt, G&B's on the blend, we in the game


Now we reached the destination, one o'clock on the dot
Went to check out the spot, it's right next to a lot
We jumped out the car, we got the whole town staring at the
New York City plates, and the dumb shit we wearing
I guess it all seems that the game could cause racket
How niggas in the Ac' and each got a Phil' jacket
A weed town out loud, we got, shit on the board
Every single day we get fresh at the in the mall
Trooping, plus we got the garage moving
We getting our connects from a dooba named Ruben
Hanging, out of state, our nine is a visit
Living in the park, but in ya park it ain't your present in the game",https://genius.com/Lost-boyz-da-game-lyrics

And through the storm and the rain
We still together, a few things changed
Through the stress and the strife
It's LB Fam 4 Life

Since '86, man we had the streets hummin
Makin power moves and still slummin
For real, they better let us come in
LB NYG, in front of green
Niggas started jackin from the Knicks to the Lakers
Us young niggas on mountain bikes, bouncin wall downs
Burn the weed in the basement of your parents
Hookie parties was the best
They tought us niggas how to finesse the fat fatty and the chest
Now we into nickel bags, dreams about Cadillacs and Jags
We ask the S girls, the sags
Play cards for the mingles
Hit the avenue for the singles, by the new artist
Yo we never knew who God is
Yo we ran with the hardest
Tell your crew, there's no stoppin them
We risin from the bottom to the top again
The hot shit, we droppin em
Chorus

Let's take it back to '94, Lifestyles of the rich we were doin it
Made it to '97, on singles still persuadin
The flows got harder, hit you with ""Love, Peace & Nappiness""
Now I can finally say my family is feeling the happiness
Even though we lost our brother through the storm and rain
Keepin it real to my hood, but now my hood is to blame
Still striving is the struggle, trying to hustle New York
I'm from Queens South Jamaica, any street that I walk
LB Fam, JnJ and Queens Most son
NY City slum, got me real close to my gun
Protectin my chest, relievin all the stress that's left
Told you in the chorus, it's LB Fam to the death
Why not, J-Drama, J-U-G-G now, Mike D now, year 2G you gonna see now
2 to 3 now, at the key now, placin D now
And at the top of the charts, is where we gonna be now

To all my go hearts, livin in mellow and live in the ghetto
From Lindon to Bellow, and rebuildin in Trestle
Hearin this fellow, affelious mellow to ignorant echo
With gun shots, plenty of fenny, each year spillin more henny and mary
Shout out 5 shuckin in the rock, back to one twenty
Yea the whole south city
I got the ghetto in me
Livin this movie script life style I ain't winnin
Hear me, ain't no way outta hood, but can't shoot like Penny
Block party, park jam and when the rain and lights go out
We got the generators
Go home on the three illa, mikey whippin cuz he illa
Move the bike, kill ya butt, baisley palm is familiar
Now you don't wanna go to South zone after 11
You might see the mack and feel the 11
Now you wanna catch the soprano, now the foes the bitch

Now it seems like a set-up
And niggas try to wet me from the door
Half a second of gun blaze then I'm in my detour
Shot through the glass hit the balcony
How could she set me up like that?
I caught my balance, shot back
I'm jettin down the fire escape I started sprayin
I'm takin five steps at a time enemy is gaining
On me, my niggas tried to warn me when my steppin
It's good though cause on a low a nigga had his weapon
I'm jettin down this dead end thrill
I hit the street I got no jacket on my back
But I got my Tim's on my feet
When my life broke across me back against the wall
I'm lookin for my enemies I'm searchin for them all
No bullets being fired so now a nigga's jettin to the corner
That's where most of the people settin

And ACaf from the 134 crew
My niggas Jug and Drama
Aiyo why I love my mama
Why I love buddha?
Aiyo why that broad I shoot her?
Because she had my money
Laughin thinkin it's funny
Took my daughter and all of my money from
My safe and yo I have none 'in'
Im broke and I'm fucked up, see?
Aiyo that boy, he tried to stink me?
I'm sneaky Freaky Tah

On this track I get spelming
Shorties don't wanna mess around me
Aiyo get and shake that doodoo brown man
Aiyo Tah, I like the way you sound man
You just represent your area
Aiyo I hope I ain't scarin ya

On the courts we get down and
Niggas don't wanna mess around me

Can’t Hold Us Down,LB IV Life,1999,"You know the life situations, hard times of deep conversations
Beef in the streets, eliminations
Shit gets iller, it's mad bullshit us niggas go through
They hate us, being broke and gettin dough too
Well let me show you, niggas how I feel when I'm singin
Ya niggas be constantly O.D.'ing
You can't show them crackers love, yo they love to take advantage
Keep actin like ya black watch where ya land bitch
A word from the wise, you know us
The late street slummers
We creep on you with rentals, no hummers
We celebrate the summers, burn trees sit up on the bench
Against the fench, watchin tournaments
These niggas know the scene, niggas roll dice for the green
Bitches the more ice the mean
Keep the cars shining, these love the creep thru the actional
And that the hood the fuckin main attraction
The hot bitches and niggas ayo we all make it happen
Sword sellin drugs are workin hard, we all rappin
Hope you recognize the realism, that I'm spittin
Not the hardest rap artist, but I'm hittin
Put the Gennus to my lip take a sip of it
Light my L, write my rhyme watch how I flip the shit
Ayo ya niggas ya be counterfeit, so tone it down a bit
A move along with you bullshit
Chorus: Lost Boyz & Mel
You can't hold us down, You can't hold us down
You can't hold us down, You can't fuck around

I creep the streets with my sounds blastin from the get up
Lay back confortable, why the fuck sit up
Rims shining, ordinary guy, makin cheddar
Life for me and wifey and for the kid it's more better
Better school and yo niggas makin better more
Like some old addition listen kid, cheddar roots
Kid you feelin me, these rap niggas killin me
Shit my team thru police they be drillin me
Niggas thrillin me, I shine like the diamond
For real a fuckin wit you money kid I'm only rhymin
But if you wanna get it on, yo we can do it
Any business that's mine yo I'm steppin to it
Livin life with no fear
My teams got my back and my rear
Niggas if you want me, I'm right here
Talkin out ya mouth, runnin out with gems and can't win
These DJ's makin tapes and can't spin
These rap niggas, makin money but they really trash
Niggas frontin like they want Parelli ass
Aiyo I pass, I'd rather listen to some R&B
Some hot shit maybe starrin me
Chorus 2X

It seems that my minds playin games on me
Police stay harass try to throw the chains on me
And try to warn me once I got up inside the game
Niggas told me that shit would never be the same
Niggas chains what money comes around the set
Niggas told me though so a nigga won't forget
Where I came from, you know the fuckin scoop
Police hate to see us cats when we on the stoop
Know the best, are whips caught sword in the chest
Knowin that we enter murder, money and the sex
Drugs, fuck with honeys who be hustlin for cheddar
They only out to make it better
Startin where it comes from
We used to sell those drums too
We represent the slums boo
How we do basically no doubt, LB Fam IV Life, yo we out

Stay getting money from the way we spit flow
Ain't nothing new man we did this from the get go
Them L.B. joints from the past still the shit yo!

What's the verdict cousin people asking
When y'all coming with the flavor that be lasting
And if the y needed it believe they need it now
Love us ghetto classy niggas and our weeded style
Do your thing don't let them steal another word from y'all
Since the passing of (Freaky) Tah we haven't heard from y'all
We've been in the lab making sure it goes
Real proper while we're working on these store- in shows
Ain't nothing changed it's still the same shit
I kept the South Jamaica flavor that I came with
Entered the game with my timbs and (Car)harrts on
I signed a record deal I sung the boulevard song
I'm still writing, I know we're trendsetters
But it still feels like these motherfuckers is still biting
It's not exciting this the way we go
Keep it ghetto nigga that's just the way we flow


What's up my name is Spigg I live the ghetto life
Got me in the club spitting with my ghetto wife
How you want to do it slow or fast flow
Bet won't think that my semi-auto mac blow
Yo bring me back home the tracks and the cash flow
Told them cats got something for that ass yo
We always knew we had it you fuckers be's not
It's a habit got feathers like a peacock
Y'all think y'all phat y'all not you know the story and the bass line
Don't let me take mine flirting with the waist line
And if it takes nine damn it I'm gonna take mine
You know the game ain't the same until you face crime
Yeah you heard we in the lab again while most of y'all babbling
Talk about you're traveling you need a good paddling
Quit the chattering pointing fingers at him and
Back streets! L.B. Fam in the house and yeah we back again!


Making hot shit we prepare it all
Corny fuckers talking yeah we hear it all
It's L.B. nigga and yo we back at it
Now if these tracks was a drug well I'm a crack addict
Man I gots to have it, it makes me feel better
We big boys sitting been getting real cheddar
Recognize the real when it comes through
We get our scoop from the streets we from the slums too
To all my ghetto rich niggas if you play here
Keep your guns up on the side they don't play fair
I read my daily scripture it makes my soul richer

Don't you want to
Give me some affection

Don't you get tired
Same smilin' faces
Don't you get a little bit lonely
Hiding in crowded places
Don't trust the stranger
You should know better
But this heart of darkness
Can be your shelter
I ain't rich enough I really don't belong here

And I'm gettin smoked out
Scate through the streets in whips crossin five digits
Takin shorts from no midgets
My style is top notch, y'all niggas can't fuck with the status
I'm climbin up the ladders, droppin shit the phattest
Yo, toss ya niggas like a salad
See ya style is softer than a love balad, don't let us get violent
Keep in silent when we run through, you know how niggas come through
Represent the slum too
Wearin black hoodies, keep a spare segreen inside of my Timbs
Jewelry shine like rims, hear ya niggas yellin
Make a little bread ya head is swellin from the bullshit you sellin
Who you tellin?

It's a New York City War Call for you all

I'm in the dark with shorty gettin tipsy
Shorty got my back, when niggas acting shifty
Spazzin when she's with me
Loves to hit them niggas tryin to get me
Shows and proves and she moves swiftly
Yo, take Atlantic City trips
While niggas backin no hood round they lips

We push the hot whips, keep they kids fed
Tight a part mister rest ahead
That jealously shit is dead, fuck it live it up
We comin through and takin shit if they don't give it up
These tattoos on my body, it's no gimmick
I'm takin shit to the essence, no limits

Let's get this cash flowin, and start ballin we all a play
To the day I'm up and gone, I'm gonna get it on
Aiyo, let's all sing along

I love this New York City life, we give and take some
You got a chance to get this cheddar nigga, make some
The only muthafucka way to go, is gettin dough
You get yours, how you gettin yours? I get my spit and flow
These niggas know about my rap capabilities
I hold the streets down for my cats and the facilities
And drink my henny when the whites, and keep the L's lit
Love to talk shit, I'm on that Queens, New York shit
That's where I'm from yo, the slum sound nation
My hot skills, help me build my foundation
Livin life up on the edge, LB Fam I pledge
To my niggas Skate Scrape, Born King and Sledge

Sit back and watch them fall, let the weed hit them off
In cause, you haven't noticed, my team is off the meters
In ceelo, not craps, and we on the rap repeaters
And if you feel you can defeate us, meet us in the center
Somebody's gettin slayed, don't be afraid to enter
Bring it to the worst, I bring it to the best
But that be dead, frontin here's something for ya chest
Chorus 2X:
It's LB Fam, right or wrong
We bring the thunder and the storm
You really thought that we were gone?
Aiyo it's time to get it on

I bring my skills to any session
Aiyo who feels that they the best?
Somethin we don't claim, but yet this game we rule finesse
Once I spit that ill shit, that leaks from the brain
You will understand why the fam cause me rain
Always hit you with that hot shit
Right where you want it
You know me and my team, up in the block we gettin blunted
Countin cheddar up, always smoke that weed
Got my chick ready to roll up, cuz the streets is full of greed

Yo cats they zonin out, one time they ask
Yo Tah what happened?
Now you in the back, my man, you step in the front
You should be rappin
Yeah you know me, be in the cut, be steady sparkin
What the fuck, niggas think they spittin shit
When I come through start barkin
All ya cats that think ya rollin to the LB Fam to death
What the fuck I do, this shit to do, is fuckin nuthin left
Cuz it take two to make a whole, what somethin you don't know
We LB Fam to the day we die, until we fuckin go
Chorus 2X

I'm talkin official Queens, we out to get the cheddar
Me and Tah together, kid that's like a butter letter
On ya back, only if you stay blunted
The timbs stay covered, believe me chicks love it
Colessuem shoppin, inside the whips hoppin
Peoples stop us in the street
""When ya shit droppin?""
Man we hibernatin, inside the car waitin
For the time for us to shine, and start regulatin
I roll with D2, them niggas they see through
Like glass, we quick to get up in ya ass
I'm a big nigga, you see I play for keeps
My games so tight I had a chick that let me stay for weeks

Colabo,LB IV Life,1999,"Let me tell you somethin, about to wild on this track
Who wanna react, nigga ain't no holdin me back
Sparkin the dutches every day, Colabo with Queens Most
Up in the party, drinkin Bacardi, yo how we go
Rockin non stop to the top
And I won't drop, till my vocal cords feel like they gon pop
Who wanna get it on, niggas try to peep my scheme
Know my team, standin right in front of the screen
I blaze it up, like flames, ain't no time for the games
Out the same Queens crew, but two different names
JnJ and QMW, here to bring the trouble too
I wild on any track like that son I be runnin you
Leavin you on the floor bleedin, eatin mess is what you needin
Cardiac arrest with poor breathin
I be leavin you in the dust, you can't front on us
We lust for the cream, and ya gun don't bust
Nigga what

My team reform like a mason meeting
I put the heat to your face, official Queens greeting
Niggas like you get slapped kid, just for speakin
While my niggas wild out, off the shit I'm drinkin
That ain't ya proof, I let loose on your whole group
While ya recruit, my fans splittin up ya fuckin loot
That's how we do, jump out like you owe somethin
You Q roll somethin, stompin like you stoled somethin
You think I'm frontin?, yo my Queens livin, money gettin
Whether its rap or coke flippin
Ya niggas need to avoid collision
Cuz your chance is tryin to advance to all my fam
When it's gun to grams, wrong plan you and your man
Quick to get rejected, I rock a 50 inch necklace
My team break records, we make ya life hectic
The Queens Most Wanted, yo my man made you run it
But shit you did, we done it, y'all niggas don't want it
Chorus 2X: Leek
Ain't no tellin what I thought of them
Me and my hooligans a ruin em
Send hot ones at his crew and him
Fluin him, M.L. style, spinned around blaze the pound
Now lay ya ass down

We be the wild type shifty livin cats from Queens
98 hold it down, basically for my team
Mega drama in the hood, y'all got to stay on point
Cuz nothin to lose, wanna be thug cats
Push ya shit back, but fuck that
We play the game too, only if it's necessary
We never start shit, we finish shit
And holdin it down, when it's time to go hard
In this rap shit too, if you wanna get technical
It's quite a few to hold it down like we do
And lay ya verse on a track that be confortable
It ain't a team out here fuckin with my crew
South Jamaica Queens, Queens Most comin through
Rob U, Wow Woo O, and my nigga Leek, and Bandit kid
Forever in my memory

Now let me get on the mic, and get the penis
What's the count em in this?
Third and one, man in motion, I'm about the blitz ya scrimmage
I see everything in my perimeter, I deliver the blows
Sendin you to the ground, you can't get up, lay down, stay down
Sendin game to O Team, wild walk, QB and O Beem
Came on the field with O E, and nobody can hold me
The acrobatic track assassinator me and Drama
Stand back to back like 25 on a calculator
Now make a move, I shake em like an earthquake
I'm a take em and tie em into a human pretzle
What's left to do then break em
I disappear like a genie, reappear on ya tv with and LP and CD
Strictly GB now we be, gutter butter family strong
Smurfin my bong, blaze trauma to bomb
On our flight to our show in Hong Kong
Now hold on tight, it's the rap reckin ball
Knockin ya out of position we don't saw
JnJ, Queens Most, colaboratin evacuate
A whole platoon of niggas, we should of did it sooner niggas

Ordinary Guy,Caught Up (Music From the Motion Picture),UnKnown,"{*Lost Boyz ad lib for the first 20 seconds*}

I think it was the month of June, when I bumped, heads with this chick
Me and my click, we was on the Van Wyck
A whip rolls up on the strip, full of freaks
The music lowers down and this passenger speaks
It's a, flame of mine from back in the day
John Adams High down on Rockaway
Like to blow around the smoke in the air from the trees
From the way it's lookin, word they still gettin G's
Scoped out the whip, I'm checkin out each honey
They must be gettin money, I didn't see code 20(?)
The L's was burnin, Alize is what they drinkin
If she said she's on the way and yo it really had me thinkin
Of back in the day when we both used to swerve
At parties we would bounce, smoke a whole ounce of herb
Word my man I never hit it raw
On the strength to-fuckin-day we still get it on, listen
Chorus: Mr. Cheeks
I'm, just your, ordinary guy
Love bitches and money and love bein high
Run with Pretty Lou, Spig Nice and Freaky Tah
How that sound? Ahhhhh-ahhhhhh
Here's a little somethin from Linden and the (?)
We used to get down and hustle my man
But nothing comes easy in this world full of shit
Nigga take this job and shove it out quick what

One day I'm workin up on the block
Slingin my motherfuckin rock
Now police they tried to run up on us
My niggas tried to warn us (where at) on all the corners
And now I'm I'm I'm I'm jettin
You see I'm almost, I'm almost, Moet-ed
Hopped over the gate, landed in my man's backyard
I knocked on the door, yo whassup bruh?
Yo let a nigga like, me in
Police they tryin to pull a nigga in
They lookin for the kid that's sellin that crack note
Lookin for the suspect in the black coat
Yo, I'm not, I'm I'm not the baddest
But these motherfuckers know my status
Now peep it I be comin with the motherfuckin
Thunder and the rain, I will remain, cause
Chorus

This job, shove it out quick
Nuttin come easy in this world full of shit
Used to put me down, to hustle with my man
Little somethin, from livin in the 'Ville
Huh, huh, huh, hustle my man
Huh, huh..

Now, now, now, now this one day I'm workin at JFK
It's the 4th of July, nigga HEY!
Something's wrong man, I don't like this day
It's going too long man, I'm gettin strong man
From pickin up these motherfuckin banners
See I want that shit to make my eyes sad
So I jumped off early, got on the back of the 10
I'm all in and in the van with my man
Now I'm up on the block, puffin lye
And I'm with Lou, Spig, and Tah
Now peoples lookin at us, lookin at us
Police they wanna come through and rush
But we ain't got no crack, we got weed
That's all we need, yes indeed
And I'll, always
Smoke weed in the hallways, cause

Take this job and shove it out quick
Nothin comes easy in this world full of shit

Heat up in the winter in the summer take the tops off
I'm from up north a New York City nigga
About 6 feet I weigh a buck 50 nigga
Not a pretty nigga smooth criminal type
Freestyle or write I could do this all night
I'm still that nigga with them (Car)hartts and them Timbs on
Rims on the whip shorty come along
It ain't hard to tell a yo I'm back now
Look at the game yo E(Dub) lay the track down
Ok now how do that sound it sound official to me
Let them know we in the place to be
And I got this chick thinking the taste's with me
And she's leaving the place with me well let's go!

Now what you hear is not a test
It's the dice game runner he's one of the best
Yo peep me at a game I came down with finesse
Yo that's my word you heard the rest well let's go get it (2x)

A yo my tux ain't rented it's been a minute I'm back in it
Pulled up in the STS this shit's tinted
Jumped out like the mack with the black apple jack on

I hit the spot and rock I gets the green
Yo listen money this is all I do
Bag chicks stack chips road trips with the crew
We world wide man we got a lot of fam
From the Boo-Yaa Tribe to {?} man
That Queens nigga get his dough in every way
No bullshit he's in the lab like every day
I throw my L's up for those that rep the team
The middle finger goes up for those that left the scene
Well how you see it well there's more green to burn than earn
You know the saying man yo you live to learn


I like to be up on the low spit my flow and get dough
Earn my keep in the game like I aim to get more
We did it in the past we still doing it now
It's the L.B.F. fuck who ruin it how
I'm far from a scrub chicks love the style
That's why they behave badly and act all wild
I love it when I bring a cutie back to the cut
I'm blowing smoke on her bootie she shaking her butt
I throw a little bit more joy juice in her cup
She lights another L up yo that's what's up
She's good to go so I throw on some songs
She peels of her jeans off and shows the thong

Bitch, this Is your warning
This Is your time, ain't no compromise
I just keep it low, I just keep it shadow, I just keep on growing
Feeding off the life of the living
All these dead Rappers, they can't hear me
I am just a lifted King living
Trying not to die, I'm livid
These kids silly, they just tripping, gone off the lean and the Henny
New fine bitch named Jenny, tryna work It out, It ain't working
Shut the fuck up, don't you get tired of talking
You look like a birdy, just talking
Tryna find a bitch, why you stalking?
Yuh, bitch, this Is your warning, this Is your time
Take off disguise, look in the sky
Look at my eyes, bitch I'm trying not to die
Bet you talking shit, boy you better not lie
Trying my crew telling lies, you had a good one, nice try

Cause we're racking up the bands, and It's weighing down my pants
Look into my eyes and I put you in a fucking trance
(Trance!)
Shut the fuck up, when you're begging on your knees
Talking bout ""Propaganda, don't shoot me!""
Better mind your own business, don't try me
1,2,3, took a knife to the gut
Propaganda, when you left that stuff?
Designer on my back, ""You don't need that much!""
Got stabbed in the back, can't trust no one
Got a strict bitch, yeah, I can't have no fun
(Nah, Fuck that!)
Got it all back, gotta hide my fucking stash
Got it all with me, and my homies have my back
Got my homies with me, and they keep that fucking strap
We don't know no one like you, and that's a fucking fact
I don't sleep at night, and my best friend Is my strap
Keep that In mind, keep that In mind
Aye, bitch, keep that In mind, aye
