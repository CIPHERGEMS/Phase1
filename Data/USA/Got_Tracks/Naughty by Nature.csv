O.P.P.,Naughty By Nature,1991.0,"Arm me with harmony
Dave, drop a load on 'em!

O.P.P., how can I explain it? I'll take it, frame by frame it
To have y'all all jumping, shouting, saying it
O is for ""other,"" P is for ""peoples',"" scratch your temple
The last P, well, that's not that simple
It's sort of like, well another way to call a cat a kitten
It's five little letters that are missing here
You get on occasion if the other party isn't gaming(Uh)
It seems I gotta start the explaining, bust it
You ever had a girl and met her on a nice hello
You get her name and number and then left feeling real mellow
You get home, wait a day she's what you wanna know about
Then you call up and it’s her girlfriend’s or her cousin’s house?!
It’s not a front, a F to the R to the O to the N to the T;
It's just her boyfriend's at her house (Oh, that’s why she’s scary)
It's O.P.P., time other people's what you get it
There's no room for relationship, there's just room to hit it
How many brothers out there know just what I'm getting a
Who think it's wrong 'cause I was splitting and co-hitting that
Well, if you do, that's O.P.P. and you're not down with it
But if you don't, here's your membership

You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
Who’s down with O.P.P.? (Every last homie!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
Who’s down with O.P.P.? (All the homies!)

Well, for the ladies O.P.P. means something gifted
The first two letters' the same but the last is something different
It's the longest, loveliest, lean, I call it the leanest
It's another five-letter word rhyming with ""cleanness"" or ""meanness""
I won't get into that, I'll do it ah sort of properly
I'll say the last P, hmmm, stands for ""property""
Now lady, here comes a kiss
Blow a kiss back to me, now tell me exactly
Have you ever known a brother who had another like a girl or wife
And you just had to stop a toast 'cause he looked just that nice?
You looked at him, he looked at you and you knew right away
He had someone but he was gonna be yours anyway!
You couldn't be seen with him at all and still you didn't care
'Cause in a room behind a door no one but y'all are there
When y'all are finished, y'all can leave and only y'all would know
And then y'all could throw that skeleton bone right in the closet do'
Now don't be shy
'Cause if you're down I want your hands up high
Say O.P.P. (O.P.P.!) I like to say with pride
Now when you do it, do it well and make sure that it counts
You're now down with a discount

You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
Who’s down with O.P.P.? (Every last lady!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
Who’s down with O.P.P.? (All the ladies!)

A scab tried to O.P.P. me, I had a girl and she knew that
Matter of fact, her and my girl was partners that
Had a fall-out, disagreement, yeah an argument
She tried to do me, so we did it in my apartment, bust it!
That wasn't the thing it must've been the way she hit the ceiling
'cause after that she kept on coming back and catching feelings
I said, ""Let's go, my girl is coming. so you gotta leave.""
She said: ""Oh no, I love you, Treach!"" I said: ""Now child, please!
You got to leave, come grab your coat, right now you gotta go!""
I said, ""Now look you choose the stairs or choose the stair window
This was a fling, a little thing you shouldn't have brought your heart
'Cause you know I was OPP, hell, from the very start!""
Come on, come on, now let me tell you what it's all about
When you get down, you can't go 'round runnin' off at the mouth
That's rule number one in this O.P.P. establishment
You keep your mouth shut and it won't get back to her or him!
Exciting, isn't it? A special kinda business
Many of you will catch the same sorta O.P.P. messing with
Him or her, for sure ain't going to admit it
When O.P.P. comes, damn skippy, I'm with it

You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
Who’s down with O.P.P.? (This whole party!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
Who’s down with O.P.P.? (This whole party!)

Hip Hop Hooray,19 Naughty III,1992.0,"Give it up for Naughty By Nature!
Hip Hop Hooray
Ho, hey, ho, hey, ho, hey, ho

You drew a picture of my mornin'
But you couldn't make my day (Hey!)
I'm rockin' and you're yawnin'
But you never look my way (Hey!)
I'm lickin' down your darlin'
In every single way (Hey!)
Your funny flow is foreign
And a green card's on the way

This ain't got shit to do with shampoo
But watch your head and shoulder
Brother older, bold enough to fold ya, yo I told ya
A raid afraid of what I made and played it, plus a funky fit
So save yo' flips and tricks for that music and the monkey bit

Triggers from the Grilltown Illtown
Some ask how it feels now
The deal is that we're real, so we're still 'round
Don't lamp with a freestyle phantom
Ain't tryin' to be handsome
Shrinkin' what you're thinkin', 'cause I'm vampin'

I live and die for Hip Hop, this is Hip Hop for today
I give props to hip-hop, so Hip Hop hooray

Ho, hey, ho
Hey, ho, hey, ho
Hip Hop Hooray
Ho, hey, ho
Hey, ho, hey, ho

You heard a lot about a brother gainin' mo' ground
Bein' low down, I do the showdown with any little ho round
No! I wanna know who you believe in
Through your funny reasons
Even when I'm sleepin' you think I'm cheatin'
You said: ""I know you, Mr. O.P.P. man
Yo, PP man, won't only see me man""
You should've known when I ain't hit it and step
That I was wit' it a bit, not to consider the rep, heck!
I did your partner 'cause she's hot as a baker
'Cause I'm Naughty by Nature, not 'cause I hate ya
You put your heart in a part of a part that spreads apart
And forgot that I forgave when you had a spark
You try to act like somethin' really big is missin'
Even though my name's graffiti-written on your kitten
I love black women always and disrespect ain't the way
Let's start a family today; Hip Hop Hooray

Ho, hey, ho
Hey, ho, hey, ho
Hip Hop Hooray
Ho, hey, ho
Hey, ho, hey, ho

Hip Hop, Hip Hip Hop, Hip Hip Hop, Hooray!
There's many hungry hip-hoppers
One reason Hip Hop's tip-top today
Swerve what you heard 'cause I ain't bailin' no hay
Ain't choppin' no crops, but still growin' every day

Here's a thunder sound from the wonders found
From the underground town down the hill
Feel how Illtown drown smiles to frowns
Snatchin' crowns from clowns, beatdowns are found
Don't know me? Don't come around!

Tippy tippy (pause) tippy tippy (pause)
Sometimes creepin' up I eat em up
Your styles are older than Lou Rawls
Peace to this one and that one and them
That way I shout-out and I didn't miss one friend
Fools get foolish, neither them or 
Parker Lewis knew us
You could have crews with shoes and can't step to us
Some kitties purr, now call me sir too
Lookin' for her crew; any trick that diss gets a curfew
I put on projects for boots
Step through troops and leave proof
My problem solver's name is 
Mook
I hittin' woodies in a hoodie
Peace to Josette, Jobete, Jo-Jo, Genae, and every hood G
That's right, my fight is ill
Peace goes to L.O.N.S.
 
and Quest
Nice & Smooth and Cypress Hill
I live and die for Hip Hop, this is Hip Hop of today
I give props to Hip Hop, so Hip Hop Hooray

Ho, hey, ho
Hey, ho, hey, ho
Hip Hop Hooray

Yoke The Joker,Naughty By Nature,1991.0,"I'm telling you, I want this done quick, in and out
I want all that black market shit, everything
Grab all the tapes, all the cassettes
Who is it?
Where the shit? Everybody on the floor, nobody move
Face down, don't nobody look at me
Where the shit?
Yo Treach, Yoke the Joker
(New style, new style)
(My name is Treach and I'm a triple-star MC)
There are too many overnight MC's but one
And too many wacked who haven't paid dues
You have now entered the path of the Flavor Unit
And we are Naughty By Nature, and will get our just due, by terminating you

I can snap, rap, pack, click-clack, patter-pat-pat
Take that ass to the point you have to ask for your ass back
A fuckin joker smoker, taunted by no one
If I was born in Chung Li's temple I would've turned out a shogun
Smack the any-and-all talk, jokers I can't hawk
And all that shit I hear about me losin' is small talk
I ain't a punk or slouch and furthermore I don't scare chief
The reason I called you pussy cause you are what you eat, each
Lick it a little closer to the center of a Blow Pop
Don't speak when I am talkin, this is my fuckin sho-op
How dare you even try me? Don't you know you be funky, while
You're smilin backstage doin' your mother, ugh, doggystyle
I'm wild, raw, a whore and still suave
Check out this style that I've
Soul-simulated, sounds from a stocky
Semi-social, never seem sloppy
See silly slappin suckers, sorry saps and slouchers
Straps slammin stouch, smackin this mass is savvy
We see so-so-songs and some shots, so
Snatch seven samples, start slowly, go solo
Set the cassette stereo, sounds diffin'
Stood the Sagittarian, some marriage is a system
Smoke the joker, three times over
And owe her, go with the flow
Or I'm about to yoke a joker

All that straight-faced shit like your heart had been through
Smile and give your face somethin the fuck to do
You're ugly, smugly, squiggly, dilly-wrinkled faced bastard
Someone needs to hit and run ya to run ya ass over backwards
Let's giddy up, yep yep, another fuck up
Grab your microphone, battle time, sho' nuff
Any freestyle I see while I prowl
I dial a new style, tell me about ooh child!
Another victory, it's mystery
I smoke your skull, your brain'll come blistery
All fuzzy, dirty, dizzy, does he
Get the things he needs? Remember how blistery?
You ain't ready for the Freddy of rap
You can't kill me, I step into your dreams, you feel me
Slicing your life away, just like my mic today
I eat you the psycho way, I'm rippin' shit right away...
I treat ya like a bitch in a ditch off of angel dust
Take you to a roof, sure you can fly, just jump slut
You think you might say a rhyme, then someone might order like
You couldn't wet shit up in a motherfuckin water fight
All lockjaw, look at the props y'all
So proud I'm sure, suck my encore's
Swingin a bolo, your flow goes solo
I'mma smoke ya
It's time to yoke the joker

The only way you wouldn't be gettin' dissed, jumped like a girlie
Is if your father would've bothered to pull it out early
You ain't got a single drip drop, you're stripped of hip-hop
If I see ya disagree, you'll be gettin your shit dropped
It's the extended version, the side you can't fuck with
You'll get the jimmy MC, you're swift to kick the bucket
I'm tired of Mr. Nice Guy, place your price high
Bet on a battle rhymer, tell my chances are sky high
Never would you ever get the thrill to say ""Yo, sweat
Y'know that kid Treach, I took him out, he was no threat""
Because you know I'm better than that on my worst day
Takin' competition's what I do in the worst way
Quick to do a hit, for you most likely I spoiled ya
I bored and ignored ya, then boringly floored ya
The proof is in the puddin', my collar ain't wooden
It takes more than an axe to tax, bless the children
Physically, facially, racially made to be
Crazily paid; a G. What a fuckin way to be!
Hot damn, I'm a man with a hand plan
Pimp smack that then attract the new game plan
Eat your big beef, digest the rest, test
Shit, I was slept yet, then go to the next step
That's what I do, that's what I say, that's what I live
That's what I prove, that's what I move, that's what I give
Makin' other brothers wanna go home and write shit
Bite what I might get, then up and say ""I quit""
Me getting got? Oh, what a beautiful thought from you
Ain't it amazing what some paper plus a pen and tongue can do?

Feel Me Flow,Poverty’s Paradise,1995.0,"You 'bout to feel the chronicles of a bionical lyric
Lyrically splittin', dismissin'
I'm on a mission of just hittin'
Now it's written and 
kitten hittin' with mittens
I'm missin', wishin', man, listen
I glisten like sun and water while fishin'
Bust the move and then swerve
Serve words with nerve embedded, I said it, word
Damn, you nerd, man, you heard
Comin' from the town of Illy and alleys
Are full of 
Phillies
 and Rallys
Suckers get silly as Sally
Then found in alleys, I'm rowdy really

So here we go
Now holla if ya hear me though
Come and feel me..... flow

Never mixin' with trickin' brothers bitchin'
Over vixens that ain't fittin' to be hittin'
For nothin', splittin' things that's bitten and gettin' written off
You're like a fatter half bladder, boy, you pissin' me off
Before you even started, so what, so long, see you fly by, my try
How else could I say it when you play it try boom bye bye
Bye bye!

Here we go
Now holla if ya hear me though
Come and feel me flow
Here we go
Now holla if ya hear me though
Come and feel me flow

The flow pro poetical with skills only a vet'll know
Better know, where's the wetter flow that's on point like decimals
Manhandlin' new crews
Partyin' with the Zoo Crew
Lookin' for the pink in boo boo's, I thought you knew too
Stone style's of stamina
Jammin' to while we plannin' to jam
We bust, plus we're the party
Amateur damagers managin'
Damagin' mics, men and even mannequins
You're a fan again
Now I wanna know, who's the man again?
Naughty's back like vertebraes
Word to hey-a-ho, the way I show, you pray I flow
Steady breakin' to the boogie so bang time
To slang, bang and watch all the poo tang tangs hang

Here we go
Now holla if ya hear me though
Come and feel me flow
Here we go
Now holla if ya hear me though
Come and feel me flow

Play and Kay'll break the body of a beat
Then beat the break into boogie
Firm and fully, chase bass lines like bullies
All we wanna know is if your body wanna party
It's nuff poo tang tang for everybody
So hip up and split up
Get up, get up your with up
Souped up, put your dukes up, no guts set up for sit-ups
Flip up, watch us rip up
Shake shows until they fizz up
Rizz up like you're with us
If not zip up your lip up, whip up
Hits with ransoms, 
foul styles get and ones
We came back 'cause we heard hip-hop needed another anthem
Black like Noah, in fact and fo' ya
If we was back in the days with the Drifters
We would've been known as the Flow-ers
Repin' these since the seventies, find me
So we went crazy in the eighties
So we won't kiss heinies in the nineties
Oops, the Naughty's troop in sections of forties
So clap your hands and 
hold your shorty, I'm Naughty

Here we go
Now holla if ya hear me though
Come and feel me flow
Here we go
Now holla if ya hear me though
Come and feel me flow
Here we go
Now holla if ya hear me though
Come and feel me flow

Everything’s Gonna Be Alright (Ghetto Bastard),Naughty By Nature,1991.0,"Doctor: Nurse Johnson, is the mother still in the recovery room?
Nurse: Yes, Dr. Blair
Doctor: OK, I'll go to the waiting room and inform the father it's a boy
Nurse: I'm afraid there is no father, sir
Doctor: Another ghetto bastard, huh?
Nurse: I'm afraid so
Doctor: Well, put him with the rest of the born losers
Nurse: All right doctor, a shame isn't it?
Doctor: Not a shame, a problem

Smooth it out
This is a story about the drifter
Who waited for the worst, cause the best lived 'cross town
Who never planned on having so didn't
Why me, huh

Everything's gonna be alright (alright)
Everything's gonna be alright (alright)
Everything's gonna be alright now (alright)
Everything's gonna be alright (alright)

Some get a little and some get none
Some catch a bad one and some leave the job half done
I was one who never had and always mad
Never knew my dad, motherfuck the fag
Well anyway, I did pick ups, 
lift and click-ups
Too many stick-ups, cause niggas had the trigger hiccups
I couldn't get a job, nappy hair was not allowed
My mother couldn't afford us all, she had to throw me out
I walked the strip with just a clip, who wanna hit
They got 'em quick, I had to eat, this money's good as spent
A 'do in braids, I wasn't paid enough
I kept 'em long cause I couldn't afford a haircut
I got laughed at, I got chumped, I got dissed
I got upset, I got a Tec and a banana clip
Was down to throw the lead to any telling crackhead
I'd still'a been broke, so a lot of good it woulda did
Or done, if not for bad luck, I would have none
Why did I have to live a life of such a bad one
Why when I was a kid and played I was a sad one
And always wanted to live like this or that one


A ghetto bastard, born next to the projects
Living in the slums with bums, I said, ""now why, Treach""
""Do it have to be like this""
Momma said I'm priceless
So I am all worthless, starved, and it's just what being nice gets
Sometimes I wish I could afford a pistol then, though
To stop the hell, I would've ended things a while ago
I ain't have jack but a black hat and knapsack
War scars, stolen cars, and a blackjack
Drop that, and now you want me to rap and give?
Say something positive?
Well positive ain't where I live
I live right around the corner from West Hell
Two blocks from South Shit and once in a jail cell
The sun never shone on my side of the street, see
And only once or twice a week I would speak
I walked alone, my state of mind was home sweet home
I couldn't keep a girl, they wanted kids with cars and chrome
Some life, if you ain't wear gold your style was old
And you got more juice and dough for every bottle sold
Hell no, I say there's gotta be a better way
But hey, never gamble in a game that you can't play
I'm slowin' and flowin' and going in on and knowing not now
How will I do it, how will I make it
I won't, that's how
Why me, huh


My third year into adulthood, and still a knucklehead
I'm better off dead huh, that's what my neighbor said
I don't do jack but fighting, lightin' up the streets at night
Playing hide-and-seek with a machete sexing Freddy's wife
Some say I'm rolling on, nothing but a dog now
I answer that with a ""fuck you"" and a bow-wow
Cause I done been through more shit within the last week
Than a fly flowing in doo-doo on the concrete
I been a deadbeat, dead to the world and dead wrong
Since I was born that's my life, oh you don't know this song
So don't say jack, and please don't say you understand
All that man-to-man talk can walk, damn
If you ain't live it, you couldn't feel it, so kill it skillet
And all that talk about it won't help it out, now will it?
In Illtown, pure luck got stuck-up, props got shot
Don't worry got hit by a flurry, and his punk-ass dropped
But I'm the one who has been labeled as an outcast
They teach in schools, I'm the misfit y'all will outlast
But that's cool with the fool, smack 'em backwards
That's what you get for fucking with a ghetto bastard

If you ain't ever been to the ghetto
Don't ever come to the ghetto
Cause you wouldn't understand the ghetto
And stay the fuck out of the ghetto
Why me (alright)",https://genius.com/Naughty-by-nature-everythings-gonna-be-alright-ghetto-bastard-lyrics
Here Comes the Money [Shane McMahon],WWE Anthology: Disc Three - Now!,UnKnown,"Here comes the money
 (here we go, money talk)
Here comes the money
Money, money, money, money
Money, money, money, money, money

Ching ching, bling bling, cut the chatter
You ain't talking money, then your talking don't matter
Ching ching, bling bling, pattin' pockets
You make the dolla dolla, can't a damn soul stop it
Shock it (uhhh)

Here comes the new kid on the block
Hold all your bets here's where the buck stops
See first of all I am steppin' out on my own
Bout time I elevated to claim my own thrown
Success in my blood, Call it home grown
Pores reekin' testosterone
Power and money got me crazy, cocky
No longer need you papi
I know your mad because you can't stop me
And if you wonder how this playa done scooped your honey
I think she smelled my cologne, It's called brand new money
Making major moves ain't a damn thing funny
Pimpin' hood rats and playboy bunnies
They see the...

They say it's, they say it's
Money, money, money, money
Money, money, money, money, money
Say what, say what, say what? Money

I'm global dolla dolla and roll with bout 50
Like to go out smelling fresh and lookin' spiffy
Don't like clean money, I want my riches to be filthy
And a retirement fund I can't touch til I'm 60
So what am I supposed to do? Roll in two
Stand there pattin the pockets, 'till I'm stackin' only two
Ching ching, bling bling, got the cash in lumps
It's a four wheel here to jack and I'm selling them out my trunk
Whenever, whatever it takes to shake down a dolla
I roll in that direction, wait a minute (holla holla)
All I wants to know, where they go, where they went
And I'm makin' monster money, smellin' just like a mint

Money, money, money, money
Money, money, money, money, money (Uh, money)
Money, money, money, money

See, we never give them pebbles they get the rocks first
Bank vaults on lock'n
Ching! Ching!

I’m rockin
My family’s Christmas stockins are shockin
Fine women, any weather
Naughty denim and leather
Call a chicken, whatever son they get better
I'm one smart cookie
The vet that smacks rookies
My stocks on top
Your checks bounce while mine boogie
Wrists, I must rock it
Chicks stop and I knock it

But there's still no mountain high enough, or wide enough to touch
The naughty nappy nasty nigga the nasty trashy ho happy pappy
That's happy to be nappy
Me and Vin rock when spots hit flocks
And groups and troops with Timbo boots and jail suits
That's how I'm rollin' my hair-do don't
Win I will I got wantin' competition ain't dope
Beat ya break ya broke ya smoke ya take ya
Send you to your little group on mute, sooner or later
He wanna flip, tell 'em full semi half with a dip
And all that other Ringling Brothers shit
Sporty naughty hi bye greater than nature while I
Shin slam the flim flam and then jam
You can run but you can't hide, you can't go far
No matter where you go, there you are

We gonna break, we gonna bash
We gonna roll, we gonna smash

Here we go yo
Hit a nigga, kill a nigga, we'll come back
See a sucker, stretch a sucker, guard your naps
Cussin' wasn't nothin' till a black man rapped
See a forty, suck a forty, guess who's back
You're chillin' with a titty feelin' villian
Steppin' to the puny puddy punks catchin' fillings
I hit so many guts, call me gutter, I'm the bread and butter
Punk motherfuckers I'll cut up, workin' from the gut up
Brand new steady, heavy as a Chevy
Ready for the piddy peddy, I'm Friddie Freddie
Place your bet on a vet, the three man threat
What you see is what you get


Comin' round the corner with my uptown bunch
I bet your bottom dollar that you're bottom buck chumps
Give it up, it's a juice thing, I'm steppin' for the rep and
Wreckin' all the rest and, weapon testin' on who's steppin'
Ain't no bluff for the niggy nuff, for the rugged ruff stuff
Nigga if you're tough, knuckle up
I'll cut your ass like class, then blast you by the trash
After I laugh then I'll dash
You can't handle the scandal of an uptown vandal
Shootin' up your toes, makin' sandals
Somebody told me that you owe me, but can't nobody hold me
I do my dirt all by my lonely",https://genius.com/Naughty-by-nature-uptown-anthem-lyrics
Mourn You Til I Join You,Nature’s Finest: Naughty by Nature’s Greatest Hits,1997.0,"It's gonna be alright, you gotta believe dat

Dear God times are changing and the weather got hot
Over the past year a lot of niggas went pop drop
So I thank you for my life and all that I got
I wanna praise you and drop off a message to Pac
I was sittin' here lookin' at your picture my nigga
Puttin' hash with the weed wit a mixture of liqour
We can't kick it you ain't wit us is the shit I can't figure
Nigga I miss ya this thug gonna miss ya till I'm wit cha'
It was 90 on the P.E. tour when we mashed down
Don't even seem like 7 years passed
Both rodies now homies out the hood on the scene
You did the humpty
 with 
D.U.
 I did the walk with the 
queen
Was a dream smokin' and drinkin' through our per diem
Stealin' backstage passes to hit ho's and coliseums
Found hoes to flip up make them lift they shit up
Get it then get up looking to chicks up and switch up
Think of all the times that I rolled wit mine
Male groupies got dissed and got the hell out of dodge
They was blinded when the good shined through they were on you
Just know I'm gon' mourn you till I join you

Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
I hope you here me now in god we trust
Even all the prayers can't bring you back to us
I'll mourn you till I join you cause I'll keep in touch

We was two lil niggas both skinny and broke
Happy if we scrap pennies for smokes
Tours over we were out yeah and you called with the news
You was over in New York to film this movie called Juice
Called you back up you told me pack up
Me and you and Stretch could shack up
The thug luv back up the act up
Shock
, Hakeem and  ain't true would call and fuss cause they know we all kicked up dust
You remember when the cabby said daddy wouldn't pick up our RACE
You beat his ass then you spit in his face
I remember on the set from the trailer fiends stole your jewels
And Big Stretch punched him out his shoes
Back then I was taking stashes quick who holdin'
That's when every piece of bud I was rolling was stolen
We would laugh at the jacks over six-packs and yacks
Spit the emos over demos thinkin' ladies and limos
Youse a wild motherfucker who could never sit still
Said you wouldn't rest until you saw a mill
Nigga I felt you
We was back an' forth borough to projects for forts
Damn I wish they knew how much you loved new york
Shit and can't nobody dis my nigga
Motha fuck that I miss my nigga
I'm a mourn you till I join you

You ain't got to worry about how long I'm gonna mourn ya
I'm gonna keep your name on the streets

Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
I hope you here me now in god we trust
Even all the prayers can't bring you back to us
I'll mourn you till I join you cause I'll keep in touch
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
I hope you here me now in god we trust
Even all the prayers can't bring you back to us
I'll mourn you till I join you cause I'll keep in touch

I'm ya true motherfucker thug nation alert
Keep his name on the street til ya lay in the dirt
This shit hurt cause we went from poor to rich
You're supposed to see a lot more than this
They brought you up locked you up when you did 
above the rim
They let you out you called us up we came as thugs again
We would hear ""ah-ha rapist"" they shout
Ya'll was talking shit that ya'll didn't know a damn thang bout
You was going through your stress while your enemies laughed
Ain't never take no shit and 2Pac never took no ass
Fuck the press fuck the world life goes on when you die
Fuck the court fuck the judge and every bitch that lied
A little time ticked by, my ho and I got rocked
My lady waking me up yelling Treach, Pac got shot
Soon as I get there I find 
Afeni
 urging' me
Saying convince my baby, don't leave after surgery
So I'm looking in her eyes while they walking me through
Thinking Pac hard head what the hell I'ma do
So we kicked it as they stayed and I asked what you need
You say a pound for comin nigga and a hit of some weed
So I asked you not to go over and over god knows
You just smiled and said nigga help me get on my clothes
So we got over that, you healed up got locked
I dropped case about lights, they had you caged when I stopped
Yeah the chain remains plus you a part of my link
They fucked up by givin' you too much time to think
I remember your release and we met up in LA
At the billiard getting blazed Henny'd out with the hay
After that you blew up a made nigga platinum plus
Addicted to drama a soldier with a nation of thugs
Now we in these savage ages
Even you yourself predicted that last night in vegas
I heard gats were brandished, my nigga once again damaged
And a part of this heart right here in Venice
At the same time, you was both loved and feared
M.O.B. the fuckin' thug of the year
I'm a mourn you til I join you

Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
I hope you here me now in god we trust
Even all the prayers can't bring you back to us
I'll mourn you till I join you cause I'll keep in touch
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
I hope you here me now in god we trust
Even all the prayers can't bring you back to us
I'll mourn you till I join you cause I'll keep in touch

We'll mourn - that's what we'll do
We'll mourn - till we're with you",https://genius.com/Naughty-by-nature-mourn-you-til-i-join-you-lyrics
Pin The Tail on the Donkey,Naughty By Nature,1991.0,"Oh finally, finally (here we are)
And for good, are the three, follow me (It ain't far
Even though if it was, you could make it to the start
The enemies, do you know who they are? (There they are)
A devil with the dorags be walkin, now I had it up to there
Oh yeah, that's the last straw (The Nature's back for......)
(*Brothers and sisters!*) (R-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-ound*) (Ugh, ugh, ugh)
Pin the tail on the junkie, find a false flavor
It's a new day to play with a neighbour
Freeze the MC's that wanna see thee
By now Naugh-ty By Nature by me
They want me to come and come up faster, that could be arranged
Dump the last of the matinee, cos they couldn't stand the damn rain
The pain's the same, the game remains mine
I got more hooks than a fish line
Bite the head off a snake
Chew up from the first to last break and shoot em in the face
Make way, (move), who are you to test me? (Huh, huh, huh......)
I seen your last porno flick, it ain't impress me
Wassup? Cuddle sport, here's a thought
(The only records that they got, are the records their crew bought)
Damn real, V-Rock, their fien'in' is funky
Pin the tail on the donkey
(*Bring that beat back*)
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go

I do more poppin than a blackhead, wreck the waxheads
I'm fed, (Go ahead, you retired tackhead)
Back to the fact of the track witta new thought
You couldn't smoke butts witta match and a Newport
Here we go, we go, we go again, witta flow we know, we know it's in
(Def play like Poppa Simpson)
KayGee's on the slice, can he co-clean?
Doin more scratchin than a funk and a dope fiend
Cold knockin' blocks off, gettin' rocks off
I don't cock off , cop out, and now cop's off
Another renegade of rap won't stop that
I'm more feared than a Sugar Hill contract
I'm known for Lettin The Hoes Go, my demo's all flow
When cursin was a no-no, you dodo
Give it up cos I'm hot wit' a warm hate
I won't stop, pop, til that head is screwed on straight
I take shorts, and no sorts, so take that clone
The only thing I take is the 8 to the path home
And I take you all the way to the north stop
Your style's more foul than a pork chop
I rock the hip-hop, non-stop tick-tock
Around the big clock, witta spot, tick-tock
Pin the tail on the jackass, it don't mean jack (chill.....)
To a brother from down the hill
Back track with a rap that remains funky
(Hmmm, and it's ugh)
Back in the day, y'all, I played with Play Doh
The dough is real now, and dildo's feel how
A starvin hungry MC gets when
MC Filet Mignon is the fixin'
I'm starvin up, it's time ta, carve them up, yup
Get em and cut em up, stuff em and cook the duck
Tough luck, tell em to shut up and jet
And feel the threat of a real life roughneck
Pin the tail on the donkey
(*Can I get a witness?*)

(Check check, where you, where you at, at??)
That another best will need a hard vest for this head check)
(What? There's another, Treach?) That's what I heard, yep
Three steps from a pit, boom, in his chest
I never knew a nigga really wanted to die
Instead he bit, instead of lookin me eye-to-eye, then I
Knew he was truly thru, dumb plus the one
To meet the mighty one, call a bad one
I rhyme about what I want to, microphone 1-2
You're doin like *?Lasuran?* then a bomb do
T-H-E M-C O-F R-A-P T-O L-double O-K
A-T﻿ I-N T-H-E N-I-N-E-T-I-E, apostrophe S, see
And I might top to step to a sexy
Fancy, prancy and dancy
No cosmo stomp, her's the true form
Style's so fat, it gets fitted with a shoe horn
Here's a clearer mirror, dear ya
Lookin in nearer, cos I don't fear ya
Some get too souped to the point
Where it's still too thick but still lick thru and thru
Always wanted a guy to come and try
To get sly and try ta, get by my
Hideous, treacherous style that's wreckin it.......

Craziest,Poverty’s Paradise,1995.0,"Today people we will be exploring the mind
Back in 1995 lots of treasures of lost scrolls were left here
We will be walking through many corridors that no one has ever seen
Or has ever returned from
Why are you so hostile?
What’s behind this anger?
Why are you so rebellious?
What are you thinking?

My thoughts are thundering, tumbling
Sons of bitches, switches, from yelling to mumbling
You ain't a pal of me, my family ties but not with Mallory
My analogy ain't for salary as I roll reality through galaxies
Four centuries, it's sent to me with the scent of weed
With a chain representing penitentiaries
From warring towns to Bordentown
From Newark to Illtown
And all you know from
Lifers, Rikers to Folsom
Wasn't driving to fast, I was flying to low
You think I'm rocking too quick, I think you're listening too slow
I'm abrupting construction a pumping assumption
You diss while your family say I'm the best shit since fucking
Struckin behind an obstruction or turning something of nothing from
Poor shit to more shit as I rip in every function
Funking it up, pumping it up, chumping the ducks
Looking to hump Ms. Junk in the Trunk, pump pump me up

Jersey niggas are the craziest
New York niggas are the craziest
DC niggas are the craziest
Philly niggas are the craziest
LA niggas are the craziest
Chi town niggas are the craziest
Texas niggas are the craziest
Utah niggas are the craziest

My lyrics be laced with 40 ounces of funk and stuff
You get rushed, you get bust, you call yourself callin' my bluff Enough's enough, I'm puttin' it down on the real end
This one goes out to all the people who be questioning my skills
Niggas I been rockin' since Lee twills
And we feel that we build careers of steel
So all the rest come up and test but only stress is what you'll find thinking
Vinnie don't write and Vinnie can't rhyme Shrinkin
The sleepin' MC I eat like Good 'n' Plenty
Lyrically spankin' ya that's why they call me Uncle Vinnie
And oh yes, I just appeal to the masses
Young to old folks, the upper, lower, middle classes
They don't begin wit no lying professor
They begin when Vin pick up the pen and pad up off the dresser
Lest a man should ever challenge the clan
With thirteen years experience of rippin' mics put in our hands

Detroit niggas are the craziest
Miami niggas are the craziest
Little Rock niggas are the craziest
Oak Town niggas are the craziest
Verse 3: Treach
I got barbarians to bogard me in
At a club that barred me when
A broad got thrown like barbarnigan born again, thrown aboard
A brim is broke to the back I brawl and band from brains ta balls
Da boots word ta-burr-bam-boo break the loot
Blowing up brain cells BOOM like Beirut
Assume the same suit, fuck that fly shit wit the flavor ca shi
Gives last name ain't Suzuki but still my sidekick
Whip that hide quick if ya slide quick, blood clot ya Blood clique
You ain't rolling if our tape ain't what ya ride wit
Niggas snipe shit so I'm on a knife tip
Like the Youngsters 'bout ta take you on some hip-hop ride shit
If you ain't jumpin then don't pump it
I'm hittin Jermaine in Atlanta cos he owe me loot for that jump shit
Fuck astronauts I rock it
And from now on if you bite my style when I see you, I'm in your pockets

Cleveland niggas are the craziest
Virginia niggas are the craziest
Kentucky niggas are the craziest
St. Louis niggas are the craziest
Atlanta niggas are the craziest
Maryland niggas are the craziest
San Diego niggas are the craziest
Seattle niggas are the craziest
Boston niggas are the craziest

This is for my peeps here I stand for you cause you stand for me

C'mon I know I jam, I know I jam jam, while oh damn
I know I jam, I know I jam jam boree
I know I jam, I know I jam jam while oh damn why don't you Jamboree for me?
Yes, Indeed

Kaboom kaboom the platoon came on in eight limbs and timbs
Broke rims smoked sims whoop dogs with bent rims
For the real and the raw from whoo'd up with the law
I never kill for the thrill but I cut for the cause
Smokin' budda with a hoota' get better prices from looters
Shake my shell with the shooters leed a luga with duga
Some say modeling and acting mean Treach is selling
(man he's Sellin')
While I'm yelling first a felon with my gat at ya melon
 (
BOOYAH
)
Hella heated, I'm too ill for them to beat it
We the most cheated most weeded most needed
You best believe it
Lets take the tapes jam for me, stand for me
Your'e damned to be without the jamboree


We've put it down since the days of high school
And everywhere we Mark we rule
Naughty's about to raise our stock
And we didn't come to brag about what we got nigga
We came to rock
We blew the spot taking the streets to pac
You'd be thug-style for a while then cold rolled our jock
Using the last few years as our evidence
Niggas been tryin' to duplicate the mixture ever since
You live in value reprimanding
If you challenge me I guarantee
When we finish I'll be the last man standing
Fuck what you heard naughty is forever in demand
When Kay drop tracks all the party people jammin'

I wanna see y'all who wanna plan with me
Wave your hands across the land if we family
Say hot-damn hot-damn we wanna jamboree
This is for my peeps here I stand for you cause you stand for me


I ask the thugs who have mercy in these days is dirty
I'm still sturdy and flirty till my derby for jersey
The funk is pass-booted lights-camera-shoot it
I just did it to do it that's why I suit it and boot it
Here's the graphic niggas is just tattered and added
Orgy's are automatic from back-traffic to addicts
Crush the cabbage straight from the savage to lavish
We rip those who rat it thats why your click had it
(?dog?) cats to cuchies for me its lootchie then hootchies
Cause we'll drop a cuzzie that leaves your whole label woozy
And shitty and dizzy because your whole city miss me
And whip out they titties
And from they kiddies throw me 50's in bundles of 100's
And make every hater want it
Drunk and blunt it knock onto the hottest nigga comin'
Kay scratch and cut ya no matta what you make or
Wanna come and touch her the punani rusher like Usher

You miss me?

See Pun gon' sing, then he gon' rhyme
Let me lick you girl where the sun don't shine
I'm gon' sing, Treach gon' rhyme
Let me lick you girl where the sun don't shine

We can do it in the middle of the (night girl)
We can do it on the beach in the (sunlight)
We can do it anywhere that you (like girl
Long as you do it, and do it, all night)
We can do it in the middle of the (night girl)
We can do it on the beach in the (sunlight)
We can do it anywhere that you (like girl
Long as you do it, and do it, all night)

So how you like it mama?  In the morning coming out the sho-wah?
How 'bout the middle of the night, late after hours?
My powers be have her coming hard to God, say good Muslim
From the way I crush the sun, the moon, and then the stars
Punisher's large like the planets
But if you make my dick hard like Janet
Then you can ride the Squad transit
Trizz Nathaniel to you, can you handle my crew?
Bend over by the fridge and hand me your brew
This is how we do, that's just how you do
Throw a hand in the air, and scream Trizz Power rules
(Trizz Power rules) Again (Trizz Power rules!)
That means you run train, with your whole damn crew (Yeah!)
C'mon


Dirty Jerz, wettin' the set, with no sweat and Moet
If you want the Treach, there's no dick with no lickin'
For you home or hubby, how come in courts make it sunny
You took off the rag, so don't get mad that it's runny
I fuck with the rubby, and long stroke don't poke
Put the hooter in your cooler 'til your booty gets soaked
I knock it from the front, and make you look at your foot
Hit it solo from the back I might forget how you look
An old crook crashin' knowin' who wanna screw
I've been fuckin' ever since you called it doin' the do
Now who you doin' it to?
The fuckin' screw of the crew?
Hittin' something and drunk drivin' past the boys in the blue
Talkin' to you


Poo-tang..tang.. no scallywagging!  Now
Hit it from the Illtown ground to Cali alley, now
Bang it in a Boogie Down building, with no windows (BX!)
With your partner riding Big Pun, passin' indo
If Pun smack her ass, tell her grab his gut
Cause when I pop the cock, watch the nuts erupt
Been platinum, no more sleepin' on Latin rapping (Boricua!)
So get your mackin' crackin' and Pun pass the Magnum
*It's me Big P the bachelor
Your Secret Garden need a weeder whacker
All I need is my gat and my black Cleopatra
She the master of seduction with a classy introduction
Must be after something way she make that ass function
Pass the Dutch and take off your boots
I'ma call my troops, and just work that caboose
Terror Squad the truth, we the proof for the kids
In the Coupe with the Trizz* *(WHOOT! There it is)*
*C'mon*

Take off your clothes, meet me in the bathtub
I wanna get it on, scrub a dub rub
Last night baby, told me that you'd stay
And when I awake it seems like you're gone for days

We can do it in the middle of the (night girl)
We can do it on the beach in the (sunlight)
We can do it anywhere that you (like girl
Long as you do it, and do it, all night)

We can do it in the middle of Little Italy
Don't worry about your man, he can't do diddily
Ohhhh... I can do it better!

Either we all gon' clap, or somebody gon' get clapped
And I'm not down with that, sure as my name's Vin Rock
In '99 I will officially re-open up the block
And dedicate my life to preservation of hip-hop
I'm tired of seein the people of my culture gettin shot
And now I must step up because I know that's all we got
I must do it, pursue it, before all the maggots make it rot
Hip-Hop, it ain't gon' die, it's gon' diversify
And as long as I'm alive, 
I'm gon' promote the I
And no matter how many people try to use or difuse it
It ain't nuttin like hip-hop music!!

Silly weak rappers are full of this
Since I'm a Don I'm puttin' out a hit
Cause I'm fired up, I'm tired of all the bullshit
Flavor Unit, it's time to attack a prey
So make way for hip-hop's green beret
Bring on the refills, you see we feel
The name of the brain game is kill or be killed
I'm an expert, who will be the next jerk to try?
Let me explain you got 8 million ways to die
We torch and scorch you, make you feel real sore
Have that ass looking just like the spook who sat by the door
Known to kill ducks, skills erupt
You ask why? My reply is 'I don't give a fuck!'
I'm a Panther, I love fresh meat
After I kill you, I'm a leave your body across 110th Street
My tactics are drastic and real fast
I tie a rope to a truck and cold drag your ass
I'm more than a threat, I'm a problem
To hell with cotton, watch out when I come to Harlem
So don't whisper or make a sound or croak
Shit you pop, go straight back down ya throat
Everyday all day this be the hard way
Putting rappers out of commission even on an off day
Flavor Unit rules G, we're taking rappers out

Here comes trouble and it's all that, in fact, contact
Your next of kin, friend, follow the flow format
While you slept, I crept, so expect to get bruised
Ask me if I give a fuck cos I ain't got shit to lose
Fuck around, lay around and get stuck up
You beat me? Wait a minute, hold the fuck up!
If I was deaf, dumb, blind, stupid, lame
Handicapped, crippled and ""pussy"" was my middle name
You couldn't beat me slick, snap that neck like a Chick-O-Stick
I know who'll getcha quick. (Who?) My dick!
Tell me, is this some type of tournament?
I cut ya fuckin' head off and use it as a Christmas tree ornament
Come and give me a test whoever claims to be the best
Leaves with a 40-below footprint on his chest
Fucked up, got stuck, go press your luck
Both of his legs were found in back of a garbage truck
Head found in the bar of a limousine
The rest of his body at a dump-site in Queens
Damn man, Mr. Handman, you like braggin
Ya fucked up, made a wrong turn and entered the dragon
I told you I'm out to stalk
Last nigga tried me, died G, felt my tomahawk
Apache, that's me, I'm get in rappers' ass

You coulda been my main shit stain but you scrap and will wack, black
The only thing I smoke witta pipe is an ass crack
You challenge Treach, I'll seal you quick, you can't touch that

Down the hill how ya feel, *?hey Ben Hef?*
Give me a hearin aid or two then I'm thru cos I'm that def
That's how we all be, tighter than small Lees
Club, rap and R&B, I'm wreckin on all 3
This drill means chill, Guard Ya Grill, trouble
Is that your head or is your neck blowin a fuckin bubble?
A-B-C, skip to the S-T
U-V-W-X, fuck the Y-Z
Brand new, Brand Nubian, Grand Puba-in
Tape damn soothes me then, if I'm wrong, sue me then
Wait let me hear another tune, tune me in
So I'm straight, if I hear ""drop the bomb"" I have to go
Break a snake' for anytime or any day, as many rhymes for many ways
Erase, forgive me not cos shit I'm hot, if I can get then you'll get got
Au contraire, mon frere, this is all my hair
I wouldn't cut it for the biggest butt-ocks out there
But on a tip or hittin hips, I'm more than quick
I Grease my Lightnin', it's frightening how I get, a slick

Oh, where's my kitty kat, where's my kitty cat at, strokin' me? (Hopin' she's open, G)
Oh, where's my kitty kat, where's my kitty cat at, strokin' me?

On and on, I coulda sworn I saw puddy cat
City titty cat, witty, pretty cat
OH, WHERE THE HELL IS MY KITTY KAT?!
Pretty patter craps, then I lick her paw, looks like a thicker broad
Thick as a brick, time to pick her draws
Now every time her waterfall flows
I'm at the tip of her toes, goin' '""Yo, GERONIMO!""
Got my name written in missiles
Capitals, lower-case, show your face, cursive and big initials
I mow the lawn every season, call me Mr. Green Thumb
'Cause I'm pushin' bushes, givin' mean ones
Cook up the stew and keep steppin'
I started another life with your wife after we met at y'all reception
I saw your thing down in the ditches
Now she does kev, does head, the dirty laundry plus the dishes
Before the hittin', throw on your mitten
And don't stop stickin' until it's written on her kitten

Oh, where's my kitty kat, where's my kitty cat at, strokin' me? (Hopin' she's open, G)
Oh, where's my kitty kat, where's my kitty cat at, strokin' me?

Halleujah! Hip Hop Hooray!
I'm up six hours early, it's a kitten hittin' day
The dog catcher doesn't speak, his moves switches
'Cause I catch the pussycat and he catches all the bitches
I go for cats, plus I ball hard
'Cause you can never get the purr or the fur from a bulldog
So I'm back for the cat, give up the nappy, skat
So I can take a cat nap
Oh yeah, I like my pussycat deep
So if she's tired or sleep, I have some place to soak my feet
I see some lookin' for a bigger knot, what a nigga got
Just make sure there's satin sheets in your litter box
That's when they hit us with our props
Make sure the room is hot and locked
With ""Gangsta Bitch"" in the boombox
I hit it chill and leave happily
And if somebody knocks it after me, there'll be a catastrophe
You don't ever let me get a little bit
For the kibbles 'n bits, I hit for nipples and tits! (Nipples and tits!)
Always do the hittin' with a lubricated mitten
Some do lickin', stickin' just to get it written on a kitten

Oh, where's my kitty kat, where's my kitty cat at, strokin' me? (Hopin' she's open, G)
Oh, where's my kitty kat, where's my kitty cat at, strokin' me?",https://genius.com/Naughty-by-nature-written-on-ya-kitten-lyrics
Let the Ho’s Go,Naughty By Nature,1991.0,"Bass me, face me, task the tip of a tasty
Bitches are sweet as a pastry
You don't know me homey, from a peach or a pony
I'm the Only, now your lyrics look lonely
Lyrically fortified, born, I'm immortalized
Lightin shit up from Wranglers to raw hides
Packed with black positivity and wizardry
I'm my own body and it built for partyin'
I rip hearts apart as if it's my last rap
The Lord's abroad and I'm respected as that
Shows seniority lays the foundation
Bo knows, and dough knows how I built the Nation
Keep the faith tastin', keep the touch clutched
Keep your face way away from the rough stuff
If it ain't rough it ain't rugged
Either you are born with none or you're stacked or star-studded
From the intro to end I will flow
And also, yo come let the ho's go

Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho (Let the ho's go)
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho

Meet my friend MAC-10, sittin backpacked and mackin'
Thirsty for action, workin' and smackin'
The last of the allies, smoke em up shall I
Or should I? I'm sure to give it a good try
No need for a survival kit, there's none left to fix
They've all been blown into dust bits
Floatin in space, spinnin' in infinity
Part of the start is the end of any identity
Lost in the source, no cause, so the boss gettin off
East, the West, the South, break North
You're about as much use as a guard dog in a graveyard
Actin is for actors so you rap but don't you play hard
I got the Mac to wax and I ain't tryin to fall back
I rap like I'm the tops, stay real cos I'm all that
It's my way on a highway, forget your friends
'Cause I'll stick that ass like I was stickin a contact lens
Let the ho's go


You say you're hittin' hard, huh, I say you're hardly hittin'
I grip ya quick like a pussy in a kitten mitten
I'm gettin grand and greater, sucker catch ya later
He gettin' paid with the fade of a Space Invader
You lookin' Moonstruck, fear, start to talkin tough
Then sayin ""sorry"" like I really give a motherfuck
You're little late, don't you think that was the wrong approach-a?
A sqwuab by the name of Treach is sure to up and smoke ya
At anytime, anywhere, for any wanted cause
I got a double-barrelled pump that's sayin ""Give me yours""
Then I'ma dash in a flash, duck and go for cover
'Cause I have warrants for this robbery and many others
Another gangster, no I'm like an angry ecker
Droppin' you and gettin mad if you don't say ""Thankyer""
The clip clockin' killers, and plus my county crew
I gotta contract for your life, now they're after you
So don't try ta hide or apologize
Apologies and go meet a French eyes is wise
So if you know what I mean and have a hot block
And never ever seen a day when the money stops
You gotta put a fist up just to let me know
Ain't I gotta pump it hard to let the ho's go
Let the ho's go


Competition on canvas, never have I heard a tongue
Throwing words to me without it being fucking hung
Give it a noose-job, neck him up and keep him learning
Should've had projects in the days of Mississippi Burning
I'd love to see the white sheet hit the concrete
And see that head go off and down from a thousand feet
Cos the brother's around me don't even play all that
They see a sheet and a cross, they say ""Don't gimme that!""
Halloween in Illtown, now don't you be a ghost
Cos you get yoked, broke, or, even worse, smoked
Now this rhyme has been called lyrically loco
But it had to have the flow to let the ho's go
Let the ho's go

Everyday All Day,Naughty By Nature,1991.0,"This is somethin that I call a flow
Not many if any, except for Vinnie, can say they know
In fact, the track is that is something that I rarely show
Because my tongue is actually fast but then again it's slow
See yo (Throw it bro)
You say ""Jiggaboo"", a name pertained for niggas who WHO
Who hear that name and place a trigger to the figure who
It blew through and if ya try ta rip, I throw a bigger blue shoe to you
And if you take the shoe, a nigga dagger will do, ooh
Treach is the best of the rest but if they try to diss it
We'll just say, ""Nigga, take a whiff, we'll see who want to be Naughty or nicest""
Like Isis, I'm priceless, plug the mic to it
Come with the D with the I with the S to the S's, see who's hypest
Test the test the Treach to Treach address the address:
How I'll bless and blow any conflicts
While they try to clone my style, it's just nonsense
""M-my ni-ni-nigga m-m-mackin"" is all you get out of it
Any and all should fall, many is small should call
Naughty By Nature the greater of all y'all
Show hope, show no hope and can't cope, so no way
This is how we play everyday all day

Havin a rather cadaver gather matters is drastically
Never say never whenever whether we come on after thee
Kay and the Gee the producer, me is loose off the claps ya see
That keeps you boogie'n happily
Voice ya opinion, it's the rhythm I'm lendin
The message I'm sendin from London to Linden
Girls are given a chance to get ya all pampered
Leaving more cramps in your pants then a bellydancer
God is good and if ya would, you should just
Play to the way I see em, play all day is what He'll bless
I'm leavin em evil and seein em bein a torture with dull props
I won't give up til you had 'nough of these skull shots
Now let the hard floor break your fall, darlin'
Cos on the strength, the Naughty Nature ain't waltzin
When we dance we come full-thrust, the bum rush
Knockin and poppin em up inside, they rockin dawn til dusk
I ain't the type to get sooped or psyched
I feel I'm better than ever before but as a rapper I'm just alright
Showin time is for clocks not hip-hoppers
Pop pop ya try to shine I make your heart work proper
And that's comin from the drifter and if ya
R-U-N ya L-I-P, you will B-E G-O-N-E
So let the just gettin' by songs, be by-gones
Nevertheless it's definitely hits and hits are what we strive on
We feel this way every single day all day
So make way

Wuz up to all you MC cub scouts
Grub scouts gettin rubbed out
I'll bet'cha kept ya album froze til this came out
Gettin' ideas to use, a half of snare or two
Snatchin and maxin a rap that I'm castin, how dare you!
How the hell can you yell what someone else said?
I must got, ""I wanna loan what I own"" on my forehead! Huh
But I doubt that, and now ya wanna back out
Your career had more ins and outs than a crack house
I'm mackin 'n rackin 'n cappin the acts and I wax em wit-wit a smack
Ya scare me as much as Mcgruff with a whiffle bat
And that's simply elementary, Watson.
So pack ya track and do 5-flat in your Datsun.
Now let my canine backtrack the copy-cat
Your night life is up. So, what you happy you got a soundtrack?
Well, so will seven thousand other rappers, groovy
The cuts ya made for that movie ain't soothe me
Who said that Treach can't work when he don't curse?
I'm nasty, ask me, naughty and nappy but happy
I'm all that and never go out the small way
You need a lift? We go this way everyday all day

Your little tape got more blank spots than a tank-top, think, stop
You oughta store it all, fast-forward 'fore I ring props
You sorry sideshow, immature rhyme ho
Come rock a lil somethin, no we're all outta time so
From Chilltown JC to Brooklyn with A-D
I'm rippin things daily, no if, ands, or maybes
The F-L and the A-V the O-R B-A-by,
Chris, the Jungle Brothers, Tribe Called Quest, yeah they be
Down with Sha-K-I-M, him, a man that's swifter than
Then the ruler, Lord Ramsey, comes handy on the road again
Mark the 45, kizz-nils, fills the reels
With the real chill, not the run-of-the-mill deals
Get poopoo dooie, producer Louie Louie
Throw a dance track to me to me
So that sometimes they do me
I can't forget the De La the Soul and Native Tongue, patrol
A strong ""What up?"" to the brothers from the Nature, yo!
We got the catchy Apache, the rocking Lakim
The never sloppy Latee, don't even try to outrhyme them
The stable not cocky, Lord Alibaski and Chill Rob G
There's trouble day with Double J, there's no probs, see
We also got the speaker Latifah, the Queen of the Flavor
And nuthin weaker behind is Swatch & Kika
The Digital Under-the-Underground, rocks with Shock and 2Pac
With Money B, Humpty and Jimmy, the master of the chops
And on the tip with several brothers, we must gets
It's Tahid, Akeem, Cracker C and Cee Justice
Plus it's the voice behind the Flavor Unit, on time or early
It's our girlie, head of the headquarters, Shirley
And we'll put last but not least, Camille
I feel you learned the way we come this deep everyday all day

Y'know what I'm sayin?
We got the newest member of the Flavor Unit, Def Jef, in effect
We got the producer of this track, Kay-Gee
We got my girl Nikki D in the house
My man, engineer all star Dave
My man on the sax, Andy
We got another engineer, Angie, and assistant Todd
We got Anj-Du, G-Quick
We got the whole entire 18th Street Posse: Rasheem, Mook Daddy
Skee Steve Hammer, Howie Cru-Ru, M-Dee, Tak Diesel, Na-Na
We got my girl Aphrodite and her posse in the house: Cherokee, Topin, and

Guard Your Grill,Naughty By Nature,1991.0,"*phone dialling*
(Hello?)
Hello, it's '91. Buckle up, guard your grill! Hee hee
(Har what the fuck?)
Has this ever happened to you?
Can you name this tune?
If these victims knew how to guard they grill, this would've never happened!

I put two and two together and I came up with four
You are forever, for god forbid, and shouldn't have to say much more
I been thru more crews than a flu, yeah I'll show ya
You're so damned scrap I betcha Bo don't know ya
You tried to get cool and say peace, save that peace for a jigsaw
Stay back and watch a real MC get raw
I never know, never know when another will come to diss this
But if and whenever they come I'm running this merry fist-mas
I shooker the crook and shaker the fake to get like a quick stick
It's just another one dud and is dismissed
Kitty guard your grill, well be for real, you ain't built
I'm silly-ho smackin MC's on a ninety degree tilt
The reason that it's tilted cos you're guilty, too hard to guard
It's not you're tryin too gay, you're tryin too hard
How hard can your guard be, I say wuz up?
Guard your grill, knuckle up, put em up, yup!

Guard your grill, knuckle up
I ain't the type to give up
Guard your grill, knuckle up
I smoke first, so what's up
Guard your grill, knuckle up
Put em up, you ain't tough
Guard your grill, knuckle up!

I give em much business, an Aspirin
Damn, I love a glass chin
What are ya askin for mercy, I'm laughin
Huh, you know the game, you know the name and you know the rep
You know the Kay, you know the Vin and you know the Treach
There's no sleeping, no nodding, no rest and hey
No snoozing, no dozing, no f'in way
Heaping things up like a Coke cup
Wind me up but y'all I gets the low wits tha rough stuff
And after enough to cut ya off a piece, still have nuff
To go around to them and him because ??? ???
I I got posse full a fighters all fly like a chopper
Youse two couldn't take em out cos they was rowdy hip-hoppers
There's so much gold for roast, the bamboo don't knock us
My nuts are my only homies that can hang proper
At school I had a locker filled with VCRs and vodka
I had two girls, one a runner, one a trotter
Back then I wore briefs till I started gettin harder
Then I grew yea long so I had to switch to boxers
How hard can your guard be, I say what's up?
Guard your grill, knuckle up, put em up, duck


I don't lay, I lie, who knows like Pinnochio
Never been to Tokyo on keyboards Dave Bellochio
Guard your grill, here's a feel, I rush hard
I got the fliest ride out here: a '91 bus card
So callin me for a ride ain't the answer;
Huh, you want a lift ya better pick up a transfer
Sayin we were good for one cut, now we're dead
Oh yeah? That's bout as funny as Barbara Bush in a bobsled
Now how wrong can you be to think we play?
Even a broken clock is right at least twice a day
So now ya feelin real low, ya no-flow  crow
You slow hobo, stiffer than Robo
Oh, here's another side of bein real quick
You might speak it fulla cracks, but you still ain't shhh...
So don't try at those same style battle cry
I rock the U-train, the routes that I battle by
I listen to censorship, entered it quite slow
Come out of that white room, shoot a pharoah with a psycho
Put down ya handgun, up which'cha hands son
Look how I stand calm, I ain't the damned one
I was only three steps from a peace prize
Pieces laid, piece of his eye and his left thigh
Knuckle up, put em up, yeah guard your grill
And that's comin from Illtown, down the hill


 This goes out to the 118th Street Posse
My man J Scratch in the house, y'knowhutI'msayin?
And oh yaeh, pss pss pss pss
 Don't forget, guard your grill, knuckle up!
 A strong what up to my man Kid Capri
 This goes out to my man Jack Don
I gotta say what's up to my man Pop Dezzy Dezza
 What's up to Clark Kent and my man Face!
 This goes out to my man Fitz and the whole Down The Hill
Cos they know how to definitely guard they grill
 I gotta say what's up to my man Dre and Easy in the house
 This goes out to my man Tamere
He's definitely in here
What's up to my homey Kool G Rap and my Brand Nubian brothers
Special shoutout to my man Grand Puba, one of the fiercest MC's out
There
Peace goes out!
 Peace to my man Frank Ben, we outta here

It’s On,19 Naughty III,1993.0,"Once again it's on...

Put me on the planet, dammit, where all the slamsters look like Janet
Slick consider this how I lick it and then fan it
Pick, rub and ran it how I run it yeah I ran it
And it ran frantic rub put new poonanie panic
Plan it, as a package, pick it and then pack it
Trick it and attract it, throw a crack then catch it
Quick as Ricochet Rabbit, quick cause it's a habit
To rap it as fast as another brother running rapid

Never call you Sir, who gives a damn if you Mix-a-lot?
East Coast gets the props, producers rock your knot
Baby ain't got back, baby got black
That's why you see the black baby and you respect that

Checka check it out, on and on and on, rock on
To the breaka breaka dawn it's on
""On and on and on, on and on and on
Checka checka it out, to the breaka breaka dawn"" -- Charlie B

Make room for one rude boy, bad mood boy, new and old school boy
Now watch a true man take out all the school boys
And don't get out of touch cause you just get a slut
With a ""Closed For Repair"" sign on your nuts

Yeah we're the thing slangers, body boom bangers
Breaking in your shit with a hanger
Damn real I'm gonna live it up
Never forgive your cut on my back watching your girl's gap give it up

I touch you where it hurts first, brutalize you with a verse
Criticize, my lyrics work
Think about a lost block, black stop
I'd rap and make a wack drop then slap you with my back drop

The boom-bang slap papper's fat fat
Step in my path and get that ass cr-crack cracked
Checka check it out, on and on and on
Rock on, to the breaka breaka dawn it's on
""On and on and on, on and on and on
Checka checka it out, to the breaka breaka dawn"" (Repeat 2x)

Singing like a buddha bang, hang out with a true crew down with the coochie
Bang
Brothers come to do the same
But monkey see, monkey do
Get your monkey ass brained!

Individuals get original cause a this a be critical
And pickable and pitiful
I ain't with the big con heart
Ripping other rhymes apart, here to spark me some iron parts

I stick to a city with some rippple, hit a bitty from the middle
Hang on kitties like a cripple nipple
Checka check it out, on and on and on
Rock on, to the breaka breaka dawn it's on
""On and on and on, on and on and on
Checka checka it out, to the breaka breaka dawn"" (Repeat 2x)",https://genius.com/Naughty-by-nature-its-on-lyrics

Yo, Treach, it was some bitch in a seminar
Talkin bout you had to get up early to wax this

Them other motherfuckers said you couldn't even wax that dirty bitch
So wassup y'all?
(Strike a nerve)

I get my daily dose of cha-cha-cha and ""Shut the fuck up, ho""
Shit, shaved, and bathed e'ryday then I must go
Ugh, this is Everyday All Day, let's all say
Pluckin enough and roughin em up and fuckin em up always
Bet, let's talk about a back flash, ya jackass
That fast you flash witta match, your fast rap
And even though you didn't know me before the flow solo
It's no slow way to go, bolos I throw or sold
Let's pick a bitch to pick with, peekaboo
I see you thru your crew, now whatchu wanna do?
After that, caps off to the black frost
My pants always sag cos I rap my ass off (Oooooh)
You wanna talk about a badboy *?sanchoi?*
I'm bad as they come, chum, straight up ricochet rap style
To Vin Rock and KayGee, I'm the baby
Droppin the ladies, cravin ya maybe, I have the right to be lazy
Got more stretch to my swing and the stretch of a chicken wing
The flavor is bacon and its cravin is icecream
I'm too trucked to be fucked and too live, otherwise
Ya drive by's smuffler, word to the mother, my brother eyed
Runnin and comin, drama starin wit a stellar
I need so many lumps, I'll use your head as a braille book
Many friends ships ink, quick, fast
It'll take a dollar worth of gas to outlast your little tired ass
You tried to swing this way, you little swifty
(Ha ha ha, slum bitches still miss me)
I do the dumpin, humpin, clappin like thunder
And that's comin from a land down under

Yo, I'm sick of dis shit, man
Niggas tryin to cut V-Rock's nuts! (Strike a nerve)
Yo, they tryin to make us drop Vin Rock, sayin he don't rock enough
Yo kick that shit

Prepare for the worst, cos I ain't livin loss
I wouldn't just give a fuck, cos givin is free and my fuck's cost
I never get lost in The Source, cos I know my way
I been there before, maybe 5-6 times a day
Sometimes I put my hands on my head when I'm done, from
And wondered to myself where did dat def shit come from?
And then I think about the Naughty and the Nature in it
And then the Flavor then the figures while I'm flowin wit it
So I won't give up, stop, stall, quit, ya kitten
You can't touch this, fuck what them throats written
I got tracks, better known as snaps, far forbidden
And the warm do, I know, I know how to make ya feel it
I'll take a head, I'll make ya spread and now lay back
I tell you once, I tell you twice, Vinnie don't play that (You don't?)
So don't start, there will be none is the lesson, folks
I hate cigarettes but my Smith & Wessun smokes
]From anywhere, from any corner, anytime that's right
Who you bashin? I go blast in broad daylight
You stand hard, you look hard, yeah, your figure's soft
I got nuff props from buckshots that niggas caught
Ya say you can't go to the takin me out close
Huh, in that case, you shoulda named your album ""Almost""
I wouldn't rely on the try if I was you, yo
Cos I'm turnin tries into ""oh oh's"" and ""hell no's""
I wouldn't be caught dead witchu up in tryin it
And if I was goin, I get my stiff ass up and rip shit
I can't go out like a wooden sock with padlocks
I'll leave tacks tiny and slimy like snot spots
I write a day, to me, it's a common caper
Say so much shit, huh, I write my rhymes on toilet paper

Yeah, Vin Rock, backbone of Naughty By Nature, y'knowI'msayin?
(Strike a nerve)
That's right, so everybody sleepin on the up, stay off of my dick
(Strike a nerve)
We're gonna stomp this time around, word up
(Strike a nerve)

Look who's mother's in the studio, thirty sons and daughters
Mrs. Happy Thing is in the back catchin quarters
Come and try to run wit it, never in a lifetime
Thirty ????? could act at Caesar's, still I bet I get mine
I heard your girl's havin a baby, now will what she have?
A bag of dope, a bottle, or crack, or a sess bag
There ain't a part of me with 'sorry' written on it, slick
You couldn't rock a crooked cradle, you fuckin prick
The way I rock could shit, you just often like it
My style's so fat I had to throw it on a water diet
Bullshit ya not, I ain't the type to be fuckin with
Wreckin with, and if I mic attest it, I'll be neckin it
Onslaught at an encore, you stinkin rat
You're so dumb you tried to buy a fuckin thinkin cap
Now that tells us in a sec right where your head is at
In between some bitch's legs, lookin ass and lap
My name is Treach, remember this and don't you ever 'fess
That's a shame, I get two minutes just to say ""Next!""
Fuck who follows you, you and them could help each other
I treat you both like any other motherfuckin runner
This is the Flavor, tasty although sugar-free
So have a Coke, have a smile and have a booger, G
(Why?) Cos you don't mean shit to me
I'mma take you ????? where good shit's meant to be
I rock a rhyme that'll be a straight up def track
Droppin more shit than White Castles and Ex-Lax
A studio to me is just a chance to rock, G
I rock and rock, god damn, call me VinRocky (ha ha)
It's just what the fuck I'm talkin bout
I say one thing and your whole crew's walkin out
So do the lyric here, this is one lyric less
If I were you, I'd take and throw em on his fuckin neck
Something that flow should come straight from the horse's mouth
Mr. Ed's dead so his ass is the best way out
Shit man for hire, this hitman is the law
I run more tracks than a San Francisco trolley car
Prepare for the win-te, oh yeah
I could write your fuckin album and you'll soon be the last one there
I start to heat up and rip shit in one, see
You couldn't get it hard if the eyes were on Broad Street
So don't you ever never tell me I'm not good enough
I got more stuff than a teddy bear, from ass to gut
This is a solid you could never outlast
If bullshit was worth a dime, you'd have a job in a cow's ass",https://genius.com/Naughty-by-nature-strike-a-nerve-lyrics
Hot Potato,19 Naughty III,1993.0,"Mic check 1-2, strap it up, load the beat, cock the mic
And your rhyme better be fat, or you might have to fight
Yeah, there's no escape from the terrordome
You know I'm nice when I'm bustin fat rhymes on the metronome
MC's never pass the mic to the Foxxx, cause
Once I bust a fat rhyme, you be a has-was
I beat you down on stage and when the battle's over
You'll be leaving your show in a hearse Nova
I'm flippin the x's three times and I'm back again
See, on my way down stage they had me strapped in
But once I hit New York and they losened the chains
I went and bought me a Tec, now I'm wild, insane
I'm on a hunt for a rapper who wanna turn singer
I got my beat-em-down bat and a itchy finger
So if you're nice with the mic and you wanna flip
I'm the rap bounty hunter and it's time to get yo ass whipped
Yeah, I'm comin from the streets, pop
And please fight back, so you can get dropped
It's time to see who's nice and who can really rap
I smack the taste out your mouth, you wanna be a mack
I'm not tryin to shake the water and wake the gator
But I'mma pass the mic like a hot potato
1 potato, 2 potato, 3 potato, 4
(1 - 2 - 3- 4)

You fly high...
I heard your tape, then flipped the next side lookin for the def side
You couldn't be alright if I erased your left side
Who's wet dried when Treach tried, next died
I'm gonna slide your wet wide, so step side
Any dull raps get the skull caps pulled back full breeze
Blastin your ass back at full speed
Hoes in flow, you know, bimbo
And won't stop prayin and playin until I'm layin up in fo'
Nowhere to run, nowhere to go
I got a solid hip below the belt to make your nuts not grow
Here's to all crews that been wack
I got a thinkin cap with raps I attached with a chin strap
Flash past your girl who's def in the flesh
Yes, you can't believe that she said ""Treach""
The wicked-a-wicked-a-wully-bully
Bad and fully and surely bad
Ready and willy gettin ???? glad
Dissed in hell and fell in fire
I attack your back, force you to retire with a wet wire
Give you the whip appeal like Toby
Listen, oldie but goldie
Take the dough from all who owe me
1 potato, 2 potato, 3 potato, 4
(1 - 2 - 3- 4)

If a rapper disrespect me I smack him in his mouth
I tow him in a yoke, grab him by his throat - boom! then I knock him out
I keep heat and keep the clips in my sock
When my Glock get hot you punk niggas better leave the block
Yeah, Freddie Foxxx on a rampage
Every time I touch the mic the police is standin front stage
Cause I been labelled as a troublemaker
I send my baddest girl to your house to play the heart breaker
She'll lay you down and put hickeys on your chest
Then turn around and blast you with a .33 shot Tec
You couldn't rap, you was wack from the get-go
So you got bumped off by my hit ho
Called by the Militant Mack, my mentality is jail
Long as I'm strapped I can't fail
Check this, I take the bass and I bust you in the eye with it
A piece of steel with a screen on top, I'm gettin fly with it
I'm bringin suckers to the street again
Cause them same broke-ass niggas ridin on my meat again
Mr. Microphone flipped the beat again
Suckers got caught with the rhyme, felt the heat again
I'm breakin it down, lettin you know I'm never lettin go
I beat your brother down, punk, just to let you know
This is hip-hop, gee, not 'hit pop'
You mess around with the beats, get your boots knocked
I'mma slide, I'm in the wind, I'll see you suckers later
As I pass the mic like a hot potato
1 potato, 2 potato, 3 potato, 4
(1 - 2 - 3- 4)

Shrimps attempt to get pimped when playin pimp, why
Sleepin with a limp eye
Pass the hot potato, Treach done ???? chop to french fries
Mad as a murder vet, man, it'll hurt a set
Well, to hell with you and your fat-o with the gurtle neck
So ol' golddigger, dig some dirt, there you have it
Want ring or a marriage, go get the carrot from a rabbit
Before I stab him for his lucky foot
Hit him with a puffy hook, hit the hare, now look how lucky looks
I'm not a chip on your shoulder, I'm a boulder on a path
Left a gash, you catch a headache in your ass
Class I'm disrespectin, I won't see you trippin, clown
Shh - when I do, you be trippin, slippin and fallin down
All's left to call cops
When I smack you with a leather wig and make you suckers suede bald spots
Chip-chop, flip the hip-hop, I chuckle
You couldn't knock boots with a muthafuckin knuckle
It's on, what's more, talk and get a boo-boo from your jaw
It's easy as 1-2-3-4
1 potato, 2 potato, 3 potato, 4
(1 - 2 - 3- 4)

That's what I'm talkin 'bout
Word up
4 potatos
4 verses
Some hard rough stuff for all those hungry MC's out there, youknowmsayin?

I went pop but I still kept my ghetto pass
And anyone who laughs kick is my yellow ass
I'm the okey dokey man the hockey pockey man
The bigger nigga with the trigger leave you smokey man
Quick to flip a trick or flatten a floppy lip
The kid never sleeps because I'm wicked off the hip

And never loose cool points I'm hard as cement slick like ointment
For those of you who don't know the big big man
You better slow down you diggity dig dig man

So niggas wan' take it there, huh?
Heh..
See y'all don't know what the fuck goin' on
I know what time it is though

It's time to erase a face in force in fact an inferno
Rise in my eyes, 
these twin 9s 'll make 'em learn though
You poppin, plottin, plannin, half-steppin', threatenin'
The streets clap loud like like thunderclouds with the weapon
I'm steppin', to clarify, lookin' with the hawk
In the arrow eye, turn the biggest part of your ass
Into the narrow side, I'm that case you place, nigga
Tie yo' bitch to the shitter, nigga, throw yo' stinkin' ass
By the liver nigga, need beef, I rag fags
Scream peace, get dragged dad
Gettin' busy like Rasheed street in Baghdad
Havin' your kids askin' ""Why did they have to drag dad?""
Past cause you'll be the last ass to blast fast
Way above the rim, word to Birdie
I'm from Jersey leavin' niggas actin nerdy
Back sturdy, my dirt, by my lonely, fuck with this
Doin' hits with more clutch, than the stick, so come on

I do my dirt all by my lonely ""Hey!"" Find the phony
Pass the mask, one deep, yeah the only
Do or die, with slugs for the Ruger
Rollin', patrollin' in a stolen black Cougar

Do or die, with slugs for the Ruger
Rollin', patrollin' in a stolen black Cougar

See I'm a one man dynasty; motherfucker
Every artist on your label don't equal half of me
Rippin' lyrics like they supposed to be
Most'll be plottin' dreamin' and schemin' to get close to me
Cause I spit shit, rip shit quick, and I'm sick with
Lyrics to mash that ass is what I'm equipped with
So fine-tune that bullshit, bring your best competitor
I'll be on that ass as if I was a fuckin' creditor
Niggas wanna battle at a show, yeah I'll set it up
I go toe-to-toe, blow-for-blow and leave it wetted up
My time to hypnotize you, OK?
Never disrespectin' the laws of Nature -- Obey Yo' Thirst
Vin Rock'll serve as the quenchin'
Here's the last thing I'd like to mention
That when it's time to set it off, trust me son
I ain't the motherfuckin click, I'm the motherfuckin one
I do my dirt all by my lonely

I roll with hundreds, sometime thousands, maybe a little more
But don't need nar' a motherfucker when it's time for the war
Some of these niggas on the streets be actin' so sweet
Talkin' 'bout stalkin' black like it ain't gon' get back to me (What?)
What about them MCs after me (hahahaha)
Come see the first rappers laid flat on Banned From TV
Part 3 in 3-D, shot right in Jersey
On the corner with the goners lookin' straight up at me (whoo!)
So fuck prolongin', I'm way past the strongarmin'

Lift a bitch out his shoes, watch the news

Fallin' through the Earth with a burst first for ya!
Clappin' ya hands now we must say errah!
For sure, but I am still thirsty, oh mercy!
It's worse, see, come first, see, oh, curse me! It's Jersey!
Slappin' through the skins, now a trends backin' in
Broader than Broad Street backed by Mac 10's
No lights, skip the cameras, we haul, actionin'
It's Naughty plannin' an orgy, already back again
Kay's trackin' this so clicks clap to this as we rap to this
Hoochies pop their coochies then slap their hips
Even when in Texas with no gear troopin'
That's when I find the baddest broads in Houston boostin'
Breakdown, feel the party
Put your hands together everybody
All the ladies in the house, I call the honies first
'Cause it's pure and ya sure ta get your money's worth
So just...

Clap Your Hands This Evening, Come On Y'all, Say It's Alright

Naughty By Nature fall? Nigga, please!
We just took the time to form three companies
Now the whole industry awaits the new recital
I'll take your favorite idol, I'll crumple up their title in their face
'Cause I'm fed up with that same ol' crap
Lack of developing your crew, that's why your stage show's wack!
So let the sleepin' and assumin' and the B.S. stop
Because, Naughty is to live and die for hip-hop and I'm VinRock!
I'm holdin' down the fort around my block
I reign in this game, jackin' other people's props
Many crews only stress me
Petty fools try to test me
Very few impress me, bless me
I sneeze upon the wack
No one but us could do it like that
To me, the rest's considered scrap
Fact: Naughty niggas will never be defeated
Come and try, word to God, word to life, I put that on the double I

Clap Your Hands This Evening, Come On Y'all, Say It's Alright

Hey! Kay makes tracks all funky like raw chitlins
Styles are splittin', think I'm kiddin'? Well, nigga, listen
Clap long and steady 'til your palm's sore or sweaty
Start cutting more than petty confetti
Right after I said bye bye to Ali Ba Ba, the punany papa's machete
Hope ya ready, but if you're not, guard ya knot
Grill, nose opposed to blows, that's all the same spot
Still chill, I rock real and raw like a brawl's a small fight
Shorty taking tall mics, so practice saying alright (Aight!!)
The party tight, pass the ball
All in the back, head towards the front 'cause the wall won't fall
I might make moves in motion, start a crammed commotion
Make kitties and titties in the city flow like lotion
Remember, freestyles were freebies
Systems still sound like CB's, l eat tracks, leave 'em wheatie
I'm greedy, can't see me wit' bi-foc's
I fry them fly folks with high hopes
Watch my smoke, now I choke
Sly stroke get by? Nope
Now negro, you were, dead-ass wrong
Head too strong, now here's your zero
We can get deep like way down
Hi lobsters, seaweed, sand, sunk ships and missing mobsters
Hip-hoppers know hard, guess who's back again
That Naughty click clan to make you clap your hands!

Verse 1: Treach
I got more damn time than I got money, honey
So if you're a gold digger, nigga please, that joke was funny
And for that diss comin from you in particular, shoot
You better kill it for a scab that isn't no ways near as cute
You say I dissed you hard after I did you fine
It ain't my fault, it's just your face that's mighty different in the daytime
See I'm the type to meet a girl and call her bluff
And say, ""I'll keep you if you're sweeter than my other stuff.""
Now like a pimp or like a pope, cuz I know hoes too well
They watch the clock, then rock and do your crew while you're in jail
Well I'm a little bit or should I say a lot past that
So take your sad Kibbles 'n Bits rap to some other cat
Gimme this and gimme that, I give that ass a smack
You wanna get a richer life, you better get a mack
So he can work ya like the trick you really are, ya stunt
I'm hittin the backdoor when I come cos you're a fuckin front
You disappointed me, I had many plans in store
I didn't know that I was in for, a project whore or
A money-grabbin dragon wit no future plans
To get a newer coat or car, you need a newer man
Cos I ain't livin to be givin out what I done saved
You wanna live in a condo? Better find a cave!
If we went half on the rent or if ya had a job
Then I could think about it before I say ""Oh naw""
""Hell no!"" is all I think about when I see you
""Damn real!"" is how I feel when I be comin thru
""Wit what?"" is what you ask, I come thru in the end
""How's that?"", cos when I drop one, I call her friends
Bravo, damn real, her Yes is what comes next
You gotta get up mighty early to twirl a Treach
I diss you, you'll be strugglin, and you say ""I want you, sir""
If ya front, if ya stunt, huh, I might want her
 (Damn, he just rip that shit)
Verse 2: Treach
(Oooooh, can I get?) Hold your breath
(Will you buy?) Not the Treach!
(I want those!) Never that!
(Gimme this!) Put it back!
(But you smooth) Very nice
(Ain't it dap?) Not the price
(Check these shoes) So, there's two
(They're on sale!) So are you!
Yes indeedy, I get greedy when it comes to dough
Cos then I'm needy with the heebie-jeebies when I'm broke
And I don't so don't wanna roll a brother any long'
So I just try a nine-to-nine over time alone
Yeah, I spend in two's infuse, baby, you won't last
You'll be runnin so fast, your feet'll be kickin your own ass
Your every ride is somethin makes you just say ""Hmmmm""
Cos she drivin his car more than he does any room
Ya call me ""Jew"" like it is true, I say ""Now hey hey there""
Call us some black shit, pop a click, I say you're halfway there
If ya wanna movie or dinner, I say ""Oh, here.""
You wanna trip or a cruise, ""Yeah, bitch."" I mean, ""No, dear.""
You'll be alright though, you'll find the right bro
He'll have the right ho, then y'all a go broke
But anyway, for any day, I'm dissin any trick
That's tryin to flick my Bic, cause I ain't havin it!

And for those who has to swear we stay here
We don’t relief to the streets nobody in there helped us outta here
Pile up the switch up
Switch up the style up
Say something fouled up
You come to step to us
I say you’re towered
Go and get your neck knocked off
Get a wreck off
So step off
Before you wipe the floor like a step cloth
They like to do all
Jumpin' hoes on low

Leaves your brain feeling light
Like to heav- you know
You know I ought flows ago
Cause my version go

You ain't hard enough to hit wind
Knock down breath fight through rain
Here's the perfect record
Starring rappers where's my name?
And if you can’t say hello at the same show
Then don't sit your R&B ass in the same row
Cause I might have a fit y'all
I might try to twist your wig off
And tell you when the hits off
Prissy ass of the week
Has a dissy ass of the month
Papa just says he rappin' to a sissy slum
End all for your whole body snotty oh no
I got more talent in my shrinkin' stinkin' pinky toe
I didn't know how many rhymes that flow
I sprouted talent
Started music in my notebooks all that counts
So it's time to make em shout
The way we feel we might drop another album two days after this one comes out
Word to rap
I won't let
For no one to know
Ho
So here we go
Come on
Oh here we go

They get so fat they get had by the mad circle
And what you gonna feel
How you gonna feel when I flow oh

Yeah I'm that fear
And I'm the same trigga nigga from last year

So don't put out an A.P.B
Put out an O.P.P
Done by you know me he he
Hanging like a tassle
Honey wanna wrassle
I tear you a new hiney like the rotten rascals
Past hoes have no place to roam
They're alone
So find them on thier asses
Send the hoes home
And best not have an attitude
If you every ho with an attitude
If I stomp you that should flatter you
Never dis the flavor unit cause well do a battle
You punch it out of you
They might want to battle you
We got tricky hes for the tricky shes
We got La, Salt N Pepa, Yo-Yo, Lyte and Nikki D
And they come figure in the higgy G
And how your lost ass was found is still a fuckin' mystery
And you can bring any one friend

Verse 1: Treach
Too many of my people got time, it shows as crime unfolds
Many snap in a trap now new minds explode
Learn the ability to find their goals
Locked in a facility where time is froze
God knows the heart hurts to see no sky, just dirt
They give a man a cell quick before they give a man work
So we get into this black, this black cat syndrome
Grow older like there's no heart and no soul ingrown
Bars and cement instead of help for our people
Jails ain't nothin but the slave day sequel
Tryin to flee the trap of this nation
Seein penitentiary's the plan ta plant the new plantation
They say we'll take the animals from cottons and crops
Straight to forgotten wit locks plottin to rottin our stocks
They draw a crooked line and wait for your foot ta fall under
Serving most of my brothers another football number
Judges look at our seeds, these brothers, like enemies
Saying ""We don't need G's"", giving out years like free cheese
Free please, nigga, ain't no freedom

Verse 2: Treach
Nowadays still we're captured, still hear wicked laughter while shackled
We're beaten and battered then cuffed after we're tackled
We're tugged while increasing the mugged and indecent
Hit one more time wit a black jack then dragged in the precinct
Still don't know what the back and forth, looking meaner, meant stripped
Made into a convict, booked then fingerprinted
How many more times of this humiliation?
How many more bouts do we have to lose while we fight for our rights in
This nation
That we supposed ta have since birth
But the breaks on the bricks get worse, so it's jail first
And that's all they offer us
Ain't that right Mr Officer?
Chorus (x10)
(This is Leron 15-431-0-5-0 up in Tennesee outta Fort Dix representin Cleveland and Illtown)
Verse 3: Treach
Some rob blocks, does it matter or should it?
While ghettos dodge, cops duck bullets and pull it
I ""Hang Out and Hustle wit my friends"" til the end, til the day we burn pens
Ain't no mystery we need victory, the system conspired
The days of the riots ain't retired
But brothers staying calm cos they soldiers
Til when the only solutions revolution, no we told ya
The chain remains til we uprise
Stuck in a land where we ain't meant to survive
And I hope this don't suit ya, some work
Like a slave ta get a hit but won't work to save for a future
And that's when the cost is the man within
And we're just as lost as the land we in
Some balst, some based and some dropped down
And most who sold it right now are lock down and rocked round
And it's been happenin so much
That they make it so that it ain't even no shock now
Chorus (x5)
(This is 
Lil' Steve 1-6-0-0-6-0-5-0

Get out in '96)
The chain remains (Peace then!)

I'm up in Fort Dix, aah, Jersey. My outdate is 12/25/2003. Way I'm thinkin

Who is locked dizzown. Cos they locked down and I don't care if we
Definitely lock down the heat. Do something, do somethin bad. Peace out!)
Outro:
Yo what's up, this Terreet Pett, formerly known as 1-11-7-19

Flags,Anthem Inc.,2011.0,"Mama don't cry for me, Papa don't feel bad
Cold on the streets, gotta keep my bang to the bang back
So I rep my hood, my city, my borough, thorougly
That's all we have

Father if you still listening, we hope our prayers make it up to heaven
If we fall then we're not forgotten don't let our lil' brothers end up like we did
Let them grow up and get a job
Don't let them grow up behind bars, trying to be hard
Oh, Father can you swiffen my feet
Repping the wrong colour on the wrong street with no heat
Rocking hickies and truckers, bandannas my brothers
My haters or lovers we still got each other
We twist our hands up and pull our pants up
Walk this way throw your flag and your setup

Mama don't cry for me, Papa don't feel bad
Cold on the streets, they bang so we got to bang back
So I rep my hood, my city, my borough, my family thorougly
That's all we have
You gotta cook the beef or you don’t eat
That’s why we fly our flags

I heard you mob and you're moody, you jacking for jewellery
You banging and beasting with your tats and your toolies
Banging for bounty you're too young for the nineties
Are you dumping with the G-Reps or jumping in the county
Shooting by the roof and scraping is what's happening
Niggas real and 'bout it so  and they cracking
If you going out tonight get your pistol and your rifle
Pray to the father and sell your soul to the cycle
You coming nigga, listen no bouncing and no bitching
Cooking by the kitchen, flags and finger flipping
Living without growing, killing without blowing
This gang is a gun it's either given or chosen
Trying to get the trigger strapped, trying to get these niggas back
Worst part of the deal it won't help bring our nigga back
Tell your babies that you love her, kiss your mama before you leave her
Hug her like you need her, cause it might be the last time you might see her


The streets are so slick, they’re greasy, as the needy feed the needy
Easy to murder if you’re hungry or greedy, gang sets in grafitti
I mean, we mean like Eeedie, I mean, I mean I finna' a track a treaty
Take my warrants to Tahiti
Throw up your flags like soccer, nothing but war on TV
R.I.P Appache up in heaven in a platinum TP
Aggressive is the message, No lessons without the effort
Bang bang live by the gun, dye by the gun, it's a flag thing",https://genius.com/Naughty-by-nature-flags-lyrics
The Hood Comes First,19 Naughty III,1993.0,"The hood no matter bad or worse comes first
The hood no matter bad or worse comes first
The hood no matter bad or worse comes first
The hood no matter bad or worse comes first

If you ain't knew me, you don't know me
You could be a sign I couldn't show me
Your girl thinks I'm a nose so she blows me
Praise the pattern please pardon all that's hard
Overnight we about to get blown like farting
There's lots of thick blonde broads, big strong cores
Tricks on board and lots of quick-tongued frauds
A lot are sitting on my tip like foreskin
Rappin' quicker more often, and bringing 'em more friends or orphans
To a style they of they own, flow they could own, so they creep the clone and get the bone
Since I'm the leader of the jump
They should've called me Captain Kangaroo
If I anger you, here's a finger to
Put it somewhere warm and tight
Leave it in all night, now you don't rhyme or walk right
I hate the way that some bring things
So when I see 'em, I'm 'a up and kick 'em in the ding-ding

The hood no matter bad or worse comes first
The hood no matter bad or worse comes first
The hood no matter bad or worse comes first
The hood no matter bad or worse comes first

I'm 'a put 'em in the bomb, just to show 'em they can blow up
Hope the fools show up, I'm 'a brag when I grow up
There's no luck and a quick fast buck when I'm rollin' up with the shim-sham strut
This is the way we roll, we stole
I heard the running man ran now you running out of fans
I jam jam with Mike the Man
To watch your mouth sell hand with heavy ready the expand
We never sell out, the only way we sold out
We sell out, the shows and we yell out ""Hooooo""
And if you ain't know
We shaking ankles, elbows, and any dancers on the floor

Hearing there's a horny girl back
Getting back at rap, screaming she's momma the mack licking cracks for tracks
There's only one Queen Latifah, that's that
Ya days when I was bitching and the other twenty on your back
Now ya wonder why ya got jacked
Cause if ya diss one member of the Flavor, the whole Unit's coming back
Remember that, or get trapped
By the pack in black, so hide ya gat

The hood no matter bad or worse comes first
The hood no matter bad or worse comes first

KayGee's cutting spots, headbutt crooked cops
The hood's hot, bustin'props
Couldn't pop the cop with a slingshot
You played post and boast we came to roast
Are we even? If you're still breathing, we ain't even close
I.O.U. Drop the 'O', drop your whole sugar-free flow
You wanna write a diss, you should'a made it so we never know
Now we do, now you're through, the Flavor crew is after you
To Iron Mike and Slick Rick, slip the Naughty names on the list
And leave room for a ninety-man clique
We saw the Rodney King thing and snapped
We should'a left our homes alone and went to paint the White House black

Daddy Was A Street Corner,19 Naughty III,1993.0,"As far as days it's a sunny one
Hear the money comes up there's a fiend I've never seen
And they bound to catch a funny one
Hear the kitty come come wouldn't need a run run
Since I think he's 5-0 why so ima  dum-dum
I know are days somehow I gotta stop at some point
But I'd rather cluck and rob ya as a gun point
I run the streets like peep on the concrete we roll deep
So don't sleep on my peeps
You would think that's the only thing to stop me
But this Glock is crazy cocky plus I'm dead already papi
This is what niggas in the hood see
The way the badder could be bad is getting based so bad they would be
Oh oh oh oh here comes the news flash from LA
But crooked cops has walked away so there's been rioting all day
The only thing that made my day a little better
I saw red and blue uniting forever
Crips and bloods fighting together
Back on the block it's the same damn strip
The same damn clip the same damn shit
You really can't expect a lot when the kid's
Juvenile and stay lock and his pops is the block!
""Niggas in the hood ain't changed""
Aw shit! Goddamn!
""Only the streets tells stories""
My daddy was a street corner a goner
Before I popped out my momma is sore
He was long gone for the border
So I grew up doing more dirt did dust
Hittin skirts getting stuff
Just to knuckle motherfuckers up
Fuck around on a bad day
? ? watch out that make the
Street niggas are coming through the alley way
And when we come we come correct and it's done
It ain't where you from is how hard your squad come
This nigga's scared nigga stop he's a rookie cop
Who couldn't bust a glass rock fools watch your stash spot
And everything'll be alright
I guess unless  in the project
It's my honey's night get my money right
Or your funny face will be beating out my fist fuck a funny fight
Whose to blame when he's plain for a name
Or a spot to go home to see pops is the fucking block
""Niggas in the hood ain't changed""
Aw shit! Goddamn!
""Only the streets telsl stories""
Some get stuck home saw cartoons saw cable
Saw new clothes with labels
I came home to corners did homework wasn't able
I clocked it we rocked it dipped it then flipped it
We upped it and cut it held in hold it then sold it, I'm wit it!
Getting hit the house all I was fiendin
When it comes to dough niggas are in it to spend it
Save it protect get a shave and a tec don't be brave get a vest
It might save you your chest
And if cops ever come to wail me down
All I say is feet don't fail me now
My town didn't have a wreck yup I was a little wreck
Didn't have a place to play
So like most kids a nigga's woulda astray
A daddy never got to meet mom
So on father's day I take a rag and I shined up the street sign
Got me on the spot spot me when I stop
Anytime or day if you'd ask me have to tell you poppa was the block
Money's coming rolling hard cluck and rolling hard
Breaking dawn on the law  do the stolen car
Every job I get dropped or I hit the lotto so I get stopped

Are those bullets in ya bra or are your nipples glad to see me
Been wishin since I'm three now I'm finally seeing a genie
Open that kitty, pretty, let me write it in graffitti
Ya name sunshine, baby, been known by the glow in your panties, sweetie
Your poonany is screaming 'Feed me' so please me, uh
Free me, don't tease me, touch your toes and kiss your knees, ease
Up in it, not minutes try sections of half 'n' hours
We'll be on every end of your house like it was ours
And you ain't gotta suggest respect sunshine, can't get less
I'll affect every part that your man neglects
I've been observing how your curving
Campaigning for a serving now see, I got that pretty kitty purring

Honey, um, yes, um
Take me to the crib and get naughty, um

One time with the sunshine
Sunshine, one time with the sun
One time with the sunshine
Sunshine, one time in the city

Are you in the easy cat or kitty category? What's the story?
You got two pairs of lips which shall I pick to make you wiggle for me?
Adore me, don't let that cat catch your tongue
One time wit sunshine and that snatch could catch you strung
Don't wanna wish to hear you sing, wanna know I heard ya sung
Here's one free vote for C notes and loose tongues
I'm here, you knock em off but you start with your boots on
A party wit the body, lordy, where only two comes
And the truth is smoked boots is the proof
Once tight socks stretched loose and condoms on the roof
Hittin steep and ain't complete til the kitten sleeps
Between the sheets, now our Naughty emblem is written deep

One time with the sunshine
Sunshine, one time with the sun
One time with the sunshine
Sunshine, one time in the city

Honey, um, yes, um
Take me to the crib and get naughty, um
One time with the sunshine

Lady, I crazy and underrated, can't be test of faded
Blowing up the spot like that ass just detonated
Spouting out sperm, not spaded out, wit my worm I waited
The hotty hair was knotty, a perm and she mighta made it
Plus she had a shitty attitude so no alarm
On a scale o' one ta damn she was a yawn
Darn, wit most it ain't no speaking after freaking
A number one, more weekend in between meetings
But sunshine was pretty as Puerto Ricans, so that thought went down wit the
Sunset
Now you wanna know how naughty can one get
Get strapped up like the Mad Hatter, lips between hips like Mick Jagger's
Do some cabin stabbin like a dagger
Just cool, let's wet up the pool and rub-a-dub
Trade your dud for a stud, bustin more than suds in a tub
So I love it when ya let it get it
Get thirsty like a dry reservoir, never sore when I wet it
Say pathetic but I say sunshine is super, put that poonany on the roof
And that shine might wake the roosters, so I'm thru til I scoop her

Fracture critic chatter, nigga catcher as I blast the cop matter
Capsule shatter, scatter men like disasters
Clips I rather gather to flip for what I'm after
Now and forever, money makes things better at a regular
Gets me jewelry, bitches, bank cards, cars, and competitors
Proposed threats wreck necks and puff ya puzzled
See trouble muzzles when I hang and hustle

Like I fucked your bitches, silly grudge
Yeah protect and serve that ass, with a billy club
Go the right way, to get rid of ya, political riddle ya
Fuck with me I'll turn you to a traffic ticketer
To put it plain I'm SICK of ya, cherry tops are pitiful
Break bones and ligments, can't fix it, so dig shit
To keep niggas ig'nant, and in crap, like pig shit
That's just a fragment, of what they invent, to bend shit
Years were handed, for Joe, left by Judy with the booty crew
But they blame the game Suzy with the snooty two (who?)
The Blockout Thugs plus the hoochie crew, shit I keep my uzi too
Who the fuck are you to tell a fool rules?
I got somethin for those droppin a loss
And somethin else for all you FAGGOTS pullin me out of my car
Let's have some fun, one on one, bite the badge, drop the gun
You did the same, thing we done, I got my niggas on the run
I ain't the one!  Fuck that!  Get up, ah get up, no get down!
We'll just be niggas on the run
I ain't the one!  Fuck that!  Get up, ah get up, no get down!
We'll just be niggas on the run

Rhyme’ll Shine On,Naughty By Nature,1991.0,"I'ma shine on, time to climb on
Stun me with an R&B harmony
So far, first to the O-R
Hand the bill until paid is a coastguard
The sonar, sounds that will throw your
Feet, to no more, no tour, show more
Versatility, deeper agility
No harassment, pass the humility
A new style blessed with a few styles
Rhyme'll shine on, I'm on a new prowl
Clap your hands in the evening
Come on y'all, say ""It's alright"" before leavin
I like a party, overpumped and lovely
All who flow, show, you think you love me
Bow in the balcony, say ""Owwwwww"" for me (Owwwww)
Now dance, so shall we?
All night long to a long, good, strong song
Hug, the rhyme'll shine on much stronger
A tougher chart buster winter to
Summer, been back thru another
Autumn, I'm callin ya all in
And fallin off like a soft man stallin
A party's live and it dies it when I'm gone
I'm born to see that the rhyme'll shine on

Clap your hands this evening
Come on ya'll, uhh, say it's alright
Clap your hands this evening
Come on y'all, say it's alright

From the tongue of a great one, I'm prepared for basin
Many are waitin, ain't in to tastin
A song which is on and long but still cock-strong
Wit an R&B cross on
A switch tip, diff'rent from the last hit
Uniquely Yorky, groovy and graphic
A new rap? This is more than just that
When I'm back, you know I'm strapped wit hot tracks
And in fact, it takes the break to shake that
Hottie of a body, waitin to get snatched
Put a dip to the hip then come back wit
Some ol' new improved holy...
Lyrics loaded, love now, let a man live
Dave, put the keys to the crib........
Aphrodite join the party!

Driftin on the memories
Nature's in the place to be wit R&B
Heh heh hehhhhhh
Wait and see, oh well
And I'm rockin, the rhyme'll shine on thru
Just for you

Straight from the soulful, smoother ruler
Doin my thing, many and whatever I choose ta
Involve the self in, many are meltin
Stop before you start, your little heart ain't helpin
The situation, knockin the nation
Hip-hop will pop pop pop the population
Praise is profits, systems knock it
Who? But this ain't as smooth as I get
A 90-man clan, a slam jam, bam stand
And I can can, play and cram fans
In any form or fashion, time for the cashin
Throw em rhythm and rappin
Half of half of even their half, then half of that half
I smash when I rap
Or quick, I stick to a hit like an iron-on

Jersey bring the bitch out the bastards
Whoa, yeah
We get cash in wit bass D.O.A
You'll find that higher Brick City D.O.A

It just ain't your time yet, and you still claiming rhyme vet
Criticize us when your bitch ass ain't even signed yet
Instincts is mental, some bitch stinking gentle
Go re-shine your cymbal and rethink your demo
If fifth was a fifth we'd both be drunk
And if it hurt my shit, he'd be dead in the trunk
Fuck the funk, pass the punk
And parade on Upper Lassgate
The charge in the city and still perform for Pataki
In that case it must be Naughty for life
Shout out to all my niggas doing 20 to life
I trust fools about as far as I see you tricks
So fuck you  I don't need you jinx (Ha!)


Spark the mic, electric kiss of death
Smoking MCs before they have a chance to take one breath
I got the shit to blow right through your vest
Any nigga thinking they wanna step to this, jump and test
Naughty's been known for bringing major niggas max of stress
Never want us in your party cause we crack your set
Little juvenile delinquent gets a classic vet
Somebody come and grab your child before I snap his neck
Uuh! Yeah! You motherfuckers disgrace me
I make money, but the money don't make me
Niggas like you be always acting so flaky
Chess while you running round your hood, don't shake ya
Crowd puts it down on the level above
It's international called Illtown love
Witness this motherfucker, just turn the mic on
I spit this shit from my bitches who get they dyke on, rap pawns


Cherry tops, some more cops, ooh where you goin'?
Creeping in somebody's house, six in the mornin'
Whoo, and they rolling deep with they gats in they hands
With they warrants, canine, and they battering rams
Somebody done got them mad
Pigs rolling through my front, feds strolling through my back
If Vin move the llello
, continue to lay low
You try to fuck me, now you bend over, pendejo
Could've been on the payroll, but you wanna play bro
So motherfuck you, and tell the captain I say so
I'll show you the master, you dick riding bastard

World Go Round,Poverty’s Paradise,1995.0,"Check it out
I heard this track right here and I kind of felt a lil' somethin'
You know, it took my mind some place it ain't been
Search deep into another world
So I'm trying to figure out what make this world go 'round, for real
People are stressed

Oh how, oh how come every time we have problems they nix none
Sending people to other planets when they still ain't fixed this one?
Victims from a distance, predictions of affliction
Some factions cause frictions so fractions need fixing
Mixing, making music, man, to make it work
Some sticking, shakin' bruisin' damn just ta brake a purse
It's worse, misguided some guttered
Locked on the block 'cause the cops can't be trusted
Busted, flustered, frustrated, frustrations of no more patience
Insides are cold and vacant, check how we lay it
Why when we speak, they try to stifle our breath?
Cock a rifle to chest, then ya have the party of ya life at ya death
Ohhhh, I wanna know, I wanna know
Oh why, oh why is it always the good that have to go?
And they tell us that's just how this life goes
So I look at the kids and wonder where their life might go
Get high to tell ya low that's how its done on the bricks
We all mad at the world when the world ain't done shit
Just the people in it and the scavengers who function
Who destroy the earth then blame the earth for its malfunctions
And that's getting maybe a tad bit too deep to follow
But the black form is strong and far from being hollow
Why do we get so much into this Freeing Willy
When Willy is free
He and them ain't doing shit to free my city
And it's a pity for those who can't get the nitty gritty
That's when the gritty gets grimy and the wicked gets witty
So much pain on the brain can't restrain
Place the comma, too much drama
But I'll bleed to please my momma
So I'ma strive to perfection, leave pride in slum sections
Keep wit' my crew and make all due corrections

But that's what makes the world go 'round
The ups and downs, a carousel

Oh how the ways?
Nowadays, baby's coming from spitting out momma's nipple
From the cradle to the killa, leaving corpse and cripples
A Brooklyn boy dies shot by a cop for a play gun
Our kids' days are up, even if they ain't stray ones
You lay one, or two, or the more now the merrier
The day's done when crews war and now streets get scarier
Cops hit blocks, saying we'll beat 'em into freedom
Then we feel robbed like there's no God when we need Him
So we act accordingly 'cause we don't see enjoyment
The only line of business I'm offered is unemployment
So we gots to get ours and I's got to get it
And it is what it be, so see that I'm with this
Media has us believin' the hype
Don't pull out ya new shoes
'Cause only the bad news is good news
Farrakhan wants us to take the streets back, time to take it
Before our whole race is stripped naked",https://genius.com/Naughty-by-nature-world-go-round-lyrics

The streets are boilin brewin hot since 1-2 to Watts
But later we go and party with more mami's than when Menudo dropped
Take a ride through the buddha block, 360 through the block
Lock it up, then stop, cause there's two of the cop
Find a crew to knock I'm in the mood to rock, fuelin hot
Actin like you knew the block when you the cops, two to drop

Ya bitch ya, I'll fix ya, raise a rapture ripped ya scripture
I'll mac a meal in fact until I stack the bills ta rack the skills
Ta get a track ta kill them rap at will, the I is capital
Double L, lower case t-o-w-n
No trouble, I'll bust your bubble then leave you for ruin
Such come a dime a dozen, fuck some
You lost the race by a dick slut's cum 'cause nuts won
What fun freaking it frequently, freak wit' me, slick ta freak quick
Your girl's poonany's packed like tha freaknic
We get redicu-down-diculous and devious, believe me bitch
Now your fucking soul ain't so mischievous
Diss who? We're the hip-hop rap pounder founder
Ricocheting PM to AM, frying freestyle flounders
Big as bouncers
Ounce ta ounces
Don't make us check you
Yes you, just know respect due!

I'm hearin' niggas in the game yappin' this yappin' that
Talkin' Vinnie don't write and Vinnie can't rap
But I bet if you put a pen and pad in my hand
I could write it in your face my friend, put it on tape and then
Give it to my nigga Kay Gee, he produces me
Pump it through the Flavor Unit, spread it through the industry
The next three weeks my single done peaked on the rap sheets
Sound's knockin' from malls to swapmeets
And then there's oh mad tours and oh mad whores
We sign autographs by the G's in the in-stores
And then there's oh mad sex and ASCAP checks
So when I, um, plex it, it's me I'm in the beamer or Lexus
Guess which nigga is next to flex this
Style that I be rippin's authentic so don't test this

You can fool some of the people some of the time
But not all of the people all of the time
Some of the rhymes some of the times 'cause some of the 9's some of 'em mine
And 'bout a brown as Bobby wit' a trolley
To bury Halle, it's chocolate so pardon Dolly as a hobby
When it comes to harm me ya don't alarm me
'Cause I roll wit' Double I and Ron G's army
So that's 235 on a slang bang
And see Ron wit' a nigga for fucking A-Train
And that's deep like the minds of Minolta
Deep ditch like the Swedish knits on John Travolta
If you don't look good we don't look good
These nuts that soon clear the room
So boom to the break and break, ah, to the snap
And snap ta the beat, I'll freak them, bring it back

Wind up and see you with all the garbage stuck
Now you in the depths of Hell, feel like damn it ain't my lucky day
Never shoulda looked my way, motherfucker
Don't trust your bitch ass fool as far as I can thrust ya
Don't make no sudden moves fool and I won't have to bust ya
Trigga Treach he got his pistol do
We puttin in work from here to Russia fool
So what the fuck y'all here to do
""Work""
Huh, and it's on like that
Motherfucker and it's on like that
""I puts in work""
And it's on like that
Yo dog I hope you cleaned your strap
""Uh huh, cuz I puts in work""

Fatal how the hood'll hate you, caught up in drama
Colors and ganja like black autototes for armor
Millies and macks never the same pocket
Kept his phillies and crack how the streets rock it
Switch em, b cases like he fathered the system
Organized block cinemas away from the prison
With souls, lost rows and so on
Fall victim to the streets and so much can go wrong
Rebels meet crumble and majesties for salaries
Out of towners and goose downers introduce pounders
A lay loot for power evil roots shoot through cowards
Lettin other niggas just regulate they hours
Coke or chronic, philly roll millie by his scrotum
Barrel x to g packs
Never got along with cops, like it was Brett Favre and D backs
It's how rap cats believe that
""Just puttin in work""
And it's on like that
Castro, you know it's on like that
""Huh huh huh huuuh work""
And it's on like that
Yeah y'all we gettin it on like that
""Puttin it in y'all, puttin it in y'all""

Check it, I get deep voice like Barry
All you keep, naw you keep
Forgot I got permit to carry
All you sleep
Look at me, his face I'll bury
I look at you and say that's what happens when cousins marry
""Work""
Hate that funk shit, don't show up
Tore up from the floor up
My gat's so fat it needs to loose weight like hold up
On the run huh, it might be bailin in a Bronco
I be layin low from Rocko
In a condo outside of Toronto
How I feel about y'all poppin shit
Like a constipated port a lot of noise but you ain't droppin shit
This is me here, it ain't no other man
Always into somebody's business like you was (?)
""Work""
Nigga I puts in like ten men
Kick up more dust than dirt
Drinkin more gin than Vin
Well see no El Nino or ghetto tsunami
Couldn't drop up on me so we got to fuck over Tommy
""I puts in work""
I puts in work, and it's on like that
Motherfucker with them snakes and rats
I puts in work
""Work""
And it's on like that
Hope you motherfuckers watch your back
Cuz I puts in work
""Work""
""New Jerus y'all Dirty Jerz y'all""

From stank booties wit cooties
The finest head is hoochie's
Bunta, change your name from Kunta
Still wouldn't do that shit that you say, who play
With that hoopla hooray, who say? What? Who try?
You lie where you try you want ta see your whole damn crew fry
The moral of the story, niggas handling it
Crooked cops wanna run us out but we ain't abandoning shit
Cos we from 1-1-8 wit a slum of crazy
Niggas wit sawn offs, tre-8's, plus nine millimetres WAIT!
You don't wanna start a riot
Cos they won't jack shit, get quiet til half the fucking force is fired
Done em boys now dem unemployed
See them on Orange Street looking ta get broke fiending in dope, looking to
Get corduroy

What's left of your respect? A bag of shit, did you see yet?
I'll G it like Viet-nam bomb, so be it
Even freak it from the deepest ta weakest, even beat walkers beat it
Body breaker from the bricks bank and booty bumper who knew boo
Hoo, scary like voodoo, strictly Illtown and Zoo crew
The party can't quit it's been plan, bought cop's hunt and man's sport
They scam sports while Illtown and Newark stand fort
We don't wrestle and fools don't disrespect us
They don't want ta get pulled inside-out from their assholes and lassoed
We just break down and boogie oogie oogie
A shoutout ta Ski, Steve Pedro, Gutta and Mookie
We're on a mission to keep pou people hoppin and hippin instead of trippin
Even if the city won't give us permission
Listen now, party's mo' butter now, better not fuck around and try ta shut

Around a pound of pound of some shit quick ta break it down

As we zoom pass one tellin me chillin's a felony
Jokers play like poker, now out comes the jealousy
Apparently I am politically overpowered, they can't touch this
We'll party no quest', protest show just the slums corruptest
So pump this, bump this, pump this if you want this

Oh, this sound real summer-like here
Hahaha! New Jeru comin through, OOH!
N-N-Naughty..

Ever since the day I got the chance to make a change
I've been in this game, it's a new day
And I'm makin it known 'cause, I just want the world to know
Y'all fill in these shoes, and I got the utmost, I just wanna let you know
I'm payin homage 'cause, you've rep this game for meeeeee

Time to get your ride on, (fireworks!) Yeah 4th of July on
From your Naughty neighbors, or your Uncle IIcons
Only hip-hop could breed superstars from criminals
And new generation of generals
All the children rap, plus they feelin that
Runnin for the summer, we finally got that feelin back (Ohh yeah!)
You see the party, see the pain from T-Pain
Thanks to Lil Wayne, Shawn record sales regain (yeah!)
Lil Weezy and Jeezy, come and feed me, I'm needy
And hip-hop get that O.G. greedy
Clap to that, rap to this, rapper chicks slap or hiss
Put some Lil' Mama on, bump up some Fabolous
Check Jimmy and Juelz, wit them ByrdGang rules
And we love to hear 'em turn slang - true!
VROOM VROOM in the Beamer, ladies got the money lookin greener
Rah Digga, Shawnna, and Trina - c'mon


Yo, we got the world unified like La Costra Nostra
Protect hip-hop from these culture vultures
Huh, it gets worse before it gets better
You don't believe, ick up a book and read the Willie Lynch letter
Ha ha! - Hung to build to big-up the next man
And when it comes to hip-hop, I'ma ALWAYS be a fan
Peace to Papoose, Saigon, Kanye
Rich Boy, Akon, Red Cafe (waddup Luda?)
The public's out to be debated on
These new artists should be praised instead of hated on
So before we start another senseless war in rap
Naughty By Nature came to bridge the gap
Yo, all that beef is wack! We gotta show some love to one another
'Cause, bottom line, we all brothers from another mother
Before, I bounce, I gotta mention was nobody iller
R.I.P. Static/Major and the homey J Dilla (J Dilla)


A new era, new tale
New style and jew-els, damn y'all fit them shoes well
Soulja Boy, thanks to you
You keep a jam through them schools that ALL my kids dancin to
Miami dawgs keep the sticky drawers
We need a ""Boss"" like Ross, so never pick a pause, Ricky Ross
Let's lasso the past flow
Grab for the cash flow, and hooray with Lupe Fiasco
Kickin rhymes with Plies, gettin juicy from groupies
Rubbin thighs, gettin woozy with Boosie (Ho ho!)
We had to hit you with them bigger raps
'Specially after Ray J and Yung Berg bought the bad bitches back
Thanks to Game for the concept
And thank God for helping, T.I. get his time clear
New money, new office, new bosses
Time for y'all to hear it, call Jimmy to clear it


That's right..
Over here gettin more higher wit Flo Rida
Haha! Wassup Lil' Scrappy?
You over there scrappin in that rappin
Yo, love to hear it baby..
This ain't no Cha-Milli Vanilli
We Cha-millionaires, over here
Throw it in the air baby!

Would’ve Done The Same For Me,Nineteen Naughty Nine: Nature’s Fury,1999.0,"We're in the time where many doors are too hard to enter in
And many people really ain't worth the mentionin'
Thugs me hugs and plus a little gentle friend
Or the mentals if I wile I get attention then
Do my drama from court to case
While others turn they back I turn my hate to faith
That's why I'm here, boo boo's, any place or date
If there's tear in my eyes you come to dry my face
Now thats deep, y'all turned from my fans to my friends
After the past, I didn't think I could stand it again
On the streets, me and Miny wonderin' shall I kill
I do for all, when will someone ask me how I feel?
Ladies, if you're down and my pics on you're wall
Just pop in this song and I won't let you fall
To all my ladies, got your letters and I love you to death
Now I appreciate the breath that the dear Lord left

Why do I stand for my fame and put it down for my peeps?
(Ooh, I like it)
Because they would've done the same for me
Why do I see my women fallin' down and put 'em back on they feet?
Because they would've done the same for me
Why do I put it down for the streets and my R.I.P's?
(Ooh, and I like it)
Because they woulda done the same for me
Why do I embrace the face that sets the mob free?
Because they would've done the same for me

With the kindness of people and most don't even know
Cause this wilderness wasn't designed to see us grow
My thugs through the years who've always been true
Just know I take the bullet for you
Life ain't livin' without givin', worth fryin' for lyin'
Ain't jack for free, but I'm supplyin' if you're tryin'
Have friends before the Benz, respect before a Lexus
Mamas gave us life, but brothas have to protect us
Some wonder why I still got love
Why I still live in the hood and why I still share grub?
Why I play with the kids, lose money on clubs?
To keep my people off the streets and away from the slugs
Sometimes rats run traps while our sista's get named
Sometimes bitches do thangs and our queens get blamed
But I'm puttin' things on blast for my women and G's
Cause you would've done the same for me


Where's my ladies who support and who understand when
Yeah I'm tired but I still gotta visit the pen
I appreciate you love the love I show them
Woulda want the same thing if I had to go in
Lost the love of my life over stress and strife
If I couldn't care for me, I couldn't care for a wife
So I looked at the Lord and what He said was right
""There's obstacles but everything's gonna be alright""
If you feelin' what I'm feelin, lay back and give me love
So when you see me on the streets or clubs give me hug
To understand unity you have to understand we
You and I, you and them, them and me, see
Y'all did for me, now I'll bow for the royalty
Just to know y'all is the love the loyalty
Behind every strong man there's a strong lady with 'em
Behind me I seem to have a whole nation of women

Why do I shout out all my women and adore my queens?
(Ooh, I like it)
Because they would've done the same for me
Why do I destroy anything that stops my team's dreams?
'Because they would've done the same for me
Why do I see my people is and tell 'em what I see to be?
(Ooh, and I like it)
Because they would've done the same for me
Why do I embrace the face that sets the mob free?
Because they would've done the same for me

Well one tease is a few, save your balls from the blues

You're givin me the blues (the blues, the blues)
Girl I got the blues (it's all because of you)
It's all because of you (I've got em, I've got em)
And those freaky things you do (let me tell you a story)
As we leave the club, you know what's up
Thinkin I'm gettin some, damn was I so dumb
Take her to the crib.. thinkin I'm gon' live
But you got, all these excuses
How you've heard about me.. and you're not ready sexually
After you done teasin me, you want to leave
Say it isn't true, I'm so excited by you
Don't know what to do, you've given me the blues
I've got em

One of the best hoes, and SO's, at my crib spot
Got the vessels in my testicles stopped on gridlock
Now why you wanna touch under drawers and tease Treach
If I bust you better duck or get your whole weave wet
Wanna shoot loose the juices, the best of hooches
Blue balls is the sewage, from shit excuses
Now from the first face, on the first date, WHAT?
Five dates, then we do it, still'll be the first fuck
You wanna come and touch, run and duck, you're tricky
Take a hickie come for Moby Dick, and slip a mickie
You came foul and phony, you left me lonely
So when I'm stiff and boney, I go and think about Naomi
With my hand as my homey, uhh!

You!!!!  You've given me the blues
Girl I've got the blues (look what you did!)
It's all because of you
And those freaky things you do (ohhh yeahh)

Hahaha, yeah
You wore panties all fancy with that sheet shit over it
Nuts tend to lock after an hour and you NOTICE
Female cause charlie horse in my shorts
Nuts beggin me to leave you in the worst part of Newark
Then I thought of a plan and you called me a pervert
Shit, hurtin and you beefin cause I want you to jerk it?
I wish I knew your booty call was a coochie brawl
I woulda had a better ball at the booty bar
Balls swole like a bowl with my dick in the dirt
Shoulda wait til you got up and went and jumped in your purse
See you felt below the belt, while I kiss it you hug it
Ain't come to suck or fuck it, shit you ain't have to TOUCH IT
My thang was cool, takin a nap on my lap
Then you rub it til my balls catch a cramp from the back
Smoke the tight sack, sport the nightcap, you spoke it right back
Balls black and blue, nuts stingin like a spiked bat
You ain't right rat!  DAMN!  DAMN!

You're givin me the blues
Girl I've got the blues (said I've got the blues)
	 wit yo' TEASIN ass
It's all because of you
	 You know what?  You ain't leavin
And those freaky things you do
	 Get your hat, get your coat
	 your purse, and GET OUT!!
You're givin me the blues

When the beat pulses the system
Who knows what comes next?

Dropping new components as we be rocking through the industry
Sufficient dynamics real satisfactory
Systematically alive pushing through the boundaries
Now all we want to do is feel the vibe to take us higher
Here comes another one unlike them other ones
Melodic and hypnotic psychotically patriotic
Let your body flow let your body flow
Fire it up fire it up

Automatic system and vinyl cipher kinetics
Microphone intimidation impenetrable phonetics
Lyrical mentality a syndication of style
Prepare to battle on the mic

Handing it to you"", fine and witty, oh, so pretty
Drop the Gucci, prop that coochie, oops
I lost my train of thought watching her walk
You know, Im looking at that ass, it ain't my fault
Get drinks, get laugh, get talk, get long
Got Pink, got hash, got smoke, got blunts
Rhinestones spiffy, shes more than pretty
Lovin' my thuggin', rubbin' my fifty nine fifty
Bullets in your bra or your nipples, hey
We laughed, talked shit, then next she said

I like the way you rock, I hope you never stop
I like the way you sound, the way you put it down
No way that I can fight it, I got my eye on you
You got me so excited, so, baby, what you gonna do?

Check it, first met her at the Fox Hill mall, getting out of her car
She had a homie with her stood about six feet tall
Both swing couldn't help but think manajatwa
So where you from we represent Crenshaw
Where they bang by law, slip your jack in your car
Oh, and Im Kelly and her name is Sherry
And she likes to sip yeagermister from her belly
Well show you if you wanna we can go hit the deli
Man, I dont think youre ready for this jelly
All pre-trick, a major erection before we go pull over at a 7-11
Protection is a must to survive and in ghetto heaven
You gotta wrap it up before you go and put your head in
We pulled up and jumped right in bed
While caressing my head, they looked up and said

I like the way you rock, I hope you never stop
I like the way you sound, the way you put it down
No way that I can fight it, I got my eye on you
You got me so excited, so what you gonna do?
Thats the way, kay, kay
Naughty likes it, kay, kay

What I wanna do you had to pick that question
Kiss it, lick it, extra friction, flex it
Love the kitty, tongue and tittie, till you sweat it
Toss you 'round my room like boom' Ill press it
I like, I like, back forth, heave ho
Round and round, baby, round we go
And I ain't here to taste the poom poom for hours
Im here to make your poom poom hours
In the shower, in the sauna, in the deli
Boom Machiavelli, KY jelly, ass to belly
Get peace with it, slap it, slap it
Treat the mattress like a human magnet, grab it
I like the way you slide it, ride it
Dont hide it, divide it, Im two steps behind it

I like the way you rock, I hope you never stop
I like the way you sound, the way you put it down
No way that I can fight it, I got my eye on you
You got me so excited, so what you gonna do?
Tell me, baby, oh, yeah
I like the way you rock, I hope you never stop
I like the way you sound, the way you put it down
No way that I can fight it, I got my eye on you
You got me so excited, so what you gonna do?
So what you gonna do? Yeah, yeah
I can't fight it, babe, you know I gotta get it, babe
You gotta give it to me, babe, oh, what you gonna do?",https://genius.com/Naughty-by-nature-what-u-wanna-do-lyrics

I glisten like sun and water while fishing
Bust the move and then swerve
Serve words with nerve embedded I said it word
Damn, you nerd man, you heard
Coming from the town of Illy and alleys are
Full of Phillies and Rallys suckers get
Silly as Sally then found in alleys, I'm rowdy really
1-So here we go now
Holla if ya hear me though, come and feel me flow
Never mixing with tricking brothers bitching
Over fixins that ain't fittin to be hittin
On nothin splittin things that's bitten
And gettin written off

Before you even started so what
So long see you fly by my try how else
Could I say it when you play it try boom bye bye

Decimals manhandlin new crews
Partying with the Zoo Crew

Hip hop needed another anthem

If we was back in the days with the Drifters
We would've been known as the Flowers
Bevin these since the seventies

Family Tree,IIcons,2002.0,"Sometimes because of jealousy and the intent to demise
Certain factions have to be forbidden or destroyed
Fire has to be sent to the poisoned forest
With the root of fresh trees planted elsewhere
Only then will you obtain a wilderness
That cannot be penetrated, petrified - family tree

See what started as a family forest got cut
To a family tree with the limbs and the leaves
Looking' at the world for answers; the world points to the sun
And the sun says the answers in me
So I search through the darkness, can't find the key
So we locked in the land of the lost; Lord, please
Tomorrow ain't promised to you nor me
So now we choose the roots, so we can plant new trees

Many minds always meet with pens and sheets
Close my eyes, think what next on my rhymes, see this face in ink
I'm havin' visions of wisdom, dreamin' 'bout my own ending
Am I seein' death as freedom and livin' as prison
My son didn't have a daddy to shape him
So God bless him with a daddy to save him, Yeah, I raise him
And pay some attention, he talked and he listened
To reach him and teach him fefore I'm gone from existence
Teach him 'bout the foes, the ho's and all opponents
Those that always talk 'bout love but never showed it
Those who had the chances to stand and always blowed it
Those that set you up by the hour to steal your moment
Pac the word is you ain't there so fuck the rumor
I'll get a pound of that shit from Bermuda and meet you in Cuba
Fucked up on Larusa no doubt, I know the locale
If they gotta born you, 
I'm gonna mourn you 'til I join you


Uhh, and now I know I got some family
Who missed me from the heart, forever we're apart
Just because I'm nothin' and you abuse me and use me
Now you wanna try to go bruise me
And even though maybe we'll end up farther than it once was
I know family don't always mean that they blood, cause
Some people just don't give a nigga what
Some people tried to use my name so all the fat we had to cut
And I'm still walking with my six amp strut
Urban eyes see through camouflage and now I know who's butt
So when I sent you tried to play me, all of a sudden now I'm shady
Maybe deep down in my heart, never trust you from the start
Never hoped you'd be my homie, don't come 'round my way
And if we never speak again, it's got to be that way
This millennium, we'll be spankin' your heiny
Remind thee Naughty invented family of the 90's


Life doesn't end when the sweat dries
A time when a nickle cost a dollar, when you rise, your chest dies
My dynasty many fear it 'cos I'm near it
Ancient Egyptian scriptures fitted in through hyroglyphics
Motherfuckers try to touch my mental state
Niggas smile up in your face and then they infiltrate
So it seems nowadays that the only plan
To get my people help my people get a load of land
And I'ma see it if I have to kill some shit
To make my family tree a motherfucking wilderness
See a black man standin' on the promised land
Since they broke every promise, I devised a plan
This black this and black that crap is gettin' touchy
Any black hat that cross my path, I call him lucky
Those who turn they back with they fears and try to D us
Before they can see us they gonna need a sweet Jesus

My gangsta thugs on this club on the motherfuckin realin
See, some motherfuckers got loot to get
It's just some motherfuckers can't shoot for shit
So my hustlers call my thugs for the slugs for the hit
And yeah my thugs roll and shoot in the hoop like a six
Came from east to the west playin steelo with Beelow
Niggas fought drinkin corpse, too much cut on the kilos
So we took every jewel that he just bought from Tito
Then Beelow rolled him through the desert
Left him bleedin in Reno, without a C-note
A section or a solid to sell it
Ain't married fuck a ring, save the carats for rabbits
Cuz a pimp and a thug and a hustler know
You trick your grip, the bitch got rich and you's the hoe, woah


You see them packin niggas goin in the club, token, smokin bud
Ain't no security at the door so they ain't even get touched
Now they better tear this motherfucker up
If you one of them niggas, us
Straight to the parkin, lift them nigga what
We all thugged out, got on khakis, fatigues and boots
Just watchin all the loud talkers floss they cheese and jewels
Clean diamond rings and suits, we ain't hatin nigga we hungry
And we'll rob your ass with the quickness if you show me the money
Call it whatever my nigga but I call it being a thug and a hustler
And you gotta have the nuts to be both
And I gotta roll with the raws
And get with the steady regardless
Fuck, how much your bitch and how many niggas you with
See we the ones that like to crash the party
Drink all the forties up and disrespect every nigga in there
Cuz we don't give a fuck (we don't)
Just cuz I be rappin and all my records went platinum
Don't exactly mean I had to get rid of my Thug Mentality
But I know some niggas be fakin themselves
That's cuz they hoes
And when they get caught up in confrontations they be scared as hell
Ain't nothin wrong with bein a thug, but y'all got to keep it real
So don't you get your ass on wax tellin lies about how you live
Now I dedicate this to my real strugglers

I'm even gon' be rich or poor, dead or handcuffed
Niggas bust (BACK) but miss, and now the war is on
And we gon' celebrate when you get murdered, deceased and gone
Retaliation is a must when you fuck with us
Tell me what was on your mind when you loaded your pistol up?
Was it some gangsta shit, that couldn't been it (nah, that ain't it)
Cause you bust four shots and still missed, now dig this
Don't know your name, but know your face
You made a mistake now you must be erased

Drop rights, to start more fights than Mills Lane

Break bones as rug-be-snug, slugs being sold and printless
Stay spittin' at your divisions, hit your visions
Chain but automatic interest got taste for higher proof liquors
If it gets adventures, affective niggas, arrest resistance
Timper screamin' that deaf vast words splintered without the whispers
Connects got prices for product, but Tune fathers vanish
Rock the cuts now I control sonic voices like ???

For pain is absolute vodka, tre, confrontation watch man
For the progress of nation, yo I'm eatin' through your concentrations...

Competition is a combination of combustion
Too valuable for commandin' nothin'
I continue cuttin' destruction's smokin' or choke eruptions
From California to Connecticut, I can hear the functions
Continue the Lexus, (Spanish) tell them (Spanish)
Category code of the street let's see the next day

Cause it's beef on the streets then kick, kick the cow
Catapult and critters kick 'em, quickers clap

And shootin' range as deep as Danny maintain gets forfeited

This ain't got shit to do with shampoo
But watch your Head 'n Shoulders

Yo, I told ya

And played em plus a funky fit
So save ya flips and tricks
Put that music in the monkey bit

Some ask how it feels now
The deal is that we're real so we're still 'round
Don't lamp with a freestyle phantom
Ain't tryin' to be handsome
Shrinkin' what ya thinkin' cause I'm vampin'

You should've know that I ain't hitting the step
That I was with it a bit
Not to consider the rep (Heck!)
I did your partner cause she's hot as a baker
Cause I'm Naughty By Nature
Not cause I hate ya
You put your heart in a part of a part that spreads apart
And forgot that I forgave when you had a spark
You try to act like something really big is missing

Ain't chopping no crop

Here's a thunder sound from the wonders found
From the underground town down the hill
Feel how Ill town
Drown smiles to frowns
Snatchin' crowns from clowns
Beat downs are found

Fools get foolish neither them or Parker Lewis knew us
You could have crews with shoes and can't step to us
Some kitty's purr
Now call me sir too
Lookin' for her crew

I put on projects for boots
Step through troops and leave proof

The naughty nappy nasty nigga the nasty trashy hoe happy pappy
That's Happi to be Nappi
Me and Vin rock when spots hit flocks
And groups and troops with Timbo boots and jail suits
That's how I'm rollin my hair-do don't
Win I will I got wantin competition ain't dope
Beat ya break ya broke ya smoke ya take ya
Send you to your little group on mute, sooner or later
When wanna flip, tell em full semi half with a dip
And all that other Ringling Brothers shit
Sporty naughty hi bye greater than nature while I
Shin slam the flim flim and then jam
You can run but you can't hide, you can't go far
No matter where you go, there you are
Chorus: repeat 2X
We gonna BREAK, we gonna BASH
We gonna ROLL, we gonna SMASH
Verse Two: Treach, Vinnie
Here we go yo
Hit a nigga kill a nigga will come back
See a sucker stretch a sucker guard your naps
Cussin wasn't nothin til a black man rapped
See a forty suck a forty guess who's back
You're chillin with a Teddy fillin villian
Steppin to the puny puddy punks catchin fillings
I hit so many guts, call me gutter, I'm the bread and butter
Punk motherfucker I'll cut up, workin from the gut up
Brand new steady, heavy as a Chevy
Ready for the piddy peddy, I'm Friddie Freddie
Place your bet on a vet, the three man threat
What you see is what you get
Chorus
Verse Three: Treach
Comin round your corner with my uptown bunch
I bet your bottom dollar that you're bottom buck chumps
Give it up, it's a juice thing I'm steppin for the rep and
Wreckin all the rest and, weapon testin on who's steppin
Ain't no bluff for the niggy nuff, for the rugged ruff stuff
Nigga if you're tough knuckle up
I'll cut your ass like class, then blast you by the trash
After I laugh then I'll dash
You can't handle the scandal of an uptown vandal
Shootin up your toes makin sandals
Somebody told me that you owe me, but can't nobody hold me
I do my dirt all by my lonely

We hope our friends make it up to heaven

O.P.P. (20th Anniversary version),Anthem Inc.,2011.0,"Arm me with harmony
Dave drop a load on 'em
Verse 1:
Hmm...OPP, how can I explain it
I'll take you frame by frame it
To have y'all all jumpin' shall we singin' it
O is for Other, P is for People...scratch yo temple
The last P Well...that's not that simple
It's sorta like a, well, another way to call a cat a kitten
It's five little letters that I'm missin' here
You get it on occassion if the other party
Isn't game'n it seems I gotta start the explainin'
Bust it
You ever had a girl and met her on a nice hello
You get her name and number then left feelin' real mellow
You get home, wait a day, she's what you wanna know about
Then you call up and it's her girlfriend's or her cousin's house
It's not a front, an F to the R to the O to the N to the T
It's just her boyfriend's at her house (Boy, that's what is scary)
It's OPP, some other people's pu... You get it?
There's no room for relationships there's just room to hit it
How many brothers out there know just what I'm gettin' at?
Who thinks it's wrong 'cos I was splittin' and co-hittin' dat?
Well if you do, that's OPP and you're not down with it
But if you don't, here's your membership
Chorus:
You down with OPP (Yeah you know me) 3X
Who's down with OPP (Every last homie)
You down with OPP (Yeah you know me) 3X
Who's down with OPP (All the homies)
Abs thta was fresh x7
Yeah u know me,yeah u know me yeah u know me all da homies!
Verse 2:
As for the ladies, OPP means something gifted
The first two letters are the same but the last is something
Different
It's the longest, loveliest, lean-- I call it the leanest
It's another five letter word rhymin' with cleanness and meanness
I won't get into that, I'll do it...uh...sorta properly
I'll say the last P...hmm...stands for property
Now lady here comes a kiss, blow a kiss back to me, now tell me
Exactly
Have you ever known a brother who had another like a girl or wife
And you just had to stop and just 'cos he look just as nice
You looked at him, he looked at you and you knew right away
He had someone but he was gonna be yours anyway
You couldn't be seen with him and honestly you didn't care
'Cos in a room behind a door no one but y'all are there
When y'all are finish, y'all can leave and only y'all would know
And y'all could throw that skeleton bone right in the closet do'
Now don't be shocked 'cos if you're down I want your hands up high
Say OPP (OPP) I like to say with pride
Now when you do it, do it well and make sure that it counts
You're now down with it, discount
Chorus:
You down with OPP (Yeah you know me) 3X
Who's down with OPP (Every last lady)
You down with OPP (Yeah you know me) 3X
Who's down with OPP (All the ladies)
This gal tried to OPP me
I had a girl and she knew that, matter-of-fact, hell, my girl was partners
That
Had a fall out, disagreement, yeah an argument
She tried to do me, so we did it in my apartment, bust it
That wasn't the thing, it must have been the way she hit the ceiling
'Cos after that she kept on coming back and catchin' feelings
I said, ""Let's go my girl is coming so you gotta leave""
She said, ""Oh no, I love you Treach"" I said, ""Now child please""
You gots to leave, come grab your coat, right now you gotta go
I said I'll look you to the stairs and to the stair window
This was a thing, a little thing, you shouldn't have brought your heart
'Cos you knew I was OPP, hell from the very start
Come on, come on, now let me tell you what it's all about
When you get down, you can't go 'round runnin' off at the mouth
That's rule number one in this OPP establishment
You keep your mouth shut and it won't get back to her or him
Exciting isn't it, a special kinda business
Many of you will catch the same sorta OPP visit with him or her
For sure, I'm going to admit it: When OPP comes
Damn skippy, I'm wit' it
Chorus:
You down with OPP (Yeah you know me) 3X
Who's down with OPP (This whole party)
You down with OPP (Yeah you know me) 3X
Who's down with OPP (This whole party)

Pitchforks and fivestars, street soldiers for sure
Got love for Latin kings, and love for Mexico!
S.A.'s and L.K.'s joint, coast to coast
Love the everyday hustlin, bustlin, musclin but what
When we war, we stay strugglin
I got a plan, a pound, a payment; let's roll
I'm seein red, the blue, the brown, black, and gold
Time to stand as one and snatch back the soul
Gangsters, we all can jack back control
Got the bitches comin with the booty and bubbly
Time to discuss streets cuz shit got ugly
I thought they all facin enemy to enemy
Cuz ain't a motherfuckin thang here industry
Who in here bangin over money, or a bitch that you ain't sure to get
Or soon as you get it, split it
Over a block that's hot, or a chain that he got
The nigga he popped, or over the dimes that he dropped
Either way we got a bil' a day
Cuz nowadays it's kids that spray, they feel that way
And if we chill and wait, and don't deliberate
You see they feel that way, and then they kill that way
I got love for my Bloods, got love for my Crips
Got love for my thugs, and we don't trip - we get rich
Love for my disciples, love for my lords
Pitchforks and fivestars, street soldiers for sure

I think it's my motherfuckin destiny
My homies bringin out the best in me
Shout to my people out on the streets who don't be stessin me
See what you fake niggas can't feel
Is that the real recognize real
Niggas who rob and steal
Could give a fuck about image and sex appeal
So when they see you on the streets (Nigga you know the deal)
Aiyyo these so-called gangsters, as so-called hard
I seen 'em rollin with a million man entourage
But then they still get touched on by the law
That makes me wonder, what the fuck they even hired 'em for
You see we all in the same gang
Because we've all hit the same thang
But now it's time niggas game changed
And while he's sleepin callin us ""lost souls""
We send a million O.G.'s straight to the pole
I got love for my Bloods, got love for my Crips
Got love for my thugs, and we don't trip - we get rich
Love for my disciples, love for my lords
Pitchforks and fivestars, street soldiers for sure

You got yo' strap, I got my strap
We got it, and you know it
We got it, and you know it
You got my back, I got yo' back
You got yo' strap, I got my strap

They get us, cuz the feds is the nigga you do the dirt with
Sick of pleading ""Your Honor"" fuck you, contempt on gettin calmer
Sick of these warrants, and drinkin and drivin drama
Time to, get connected, and stop makin them records
Bout slangin and bangin, but they can't hold it when it get hectic
Alotta niggas live soft and act hard
Alotta rappers be claimin they be gangsters but trackstars
Alotta cops kick ass, for quick cash, and fast cars
The bottom of the beaten niggas with the last scars
I'mma do Diallo, I feel dawg he was hollow
If we don't fight today, it's nothin to fight for tomorrow

Got love for my thugs, and we don't trip - we get rich
