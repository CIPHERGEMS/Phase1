100,The Documentary 2,2015.0,"Real nigga shit
Other night at your crib, it was like me, Black, 40, OB
We just sittin' there talkin' 'bout life
Played some beats, but I forgot to tell you one thing

Niggas called me to set you up
Want me to come and wet you up
'Cause you a out of town nigga like Biggie
Heard about the shit with Diddy
So I came through to vest you up
And I got a vest for 40, a vest for Hush
A vest for every nigga with an owl on his chest and what
I got L.A. unified
You better off committin' suicide, teachers ain't testin' us
See, I know how it feel to be platinum-plus
Niggas is jealous of you, so they try to wrap you up
Tax you up, but it's OVO/Blood Money
Nigga catch these bullets like he catch the bus
Dawg, fame is a motherfucker
Do a nigga four favors, when you can't do the fifth
How soon they forget?
Run up on you at your granny house, give you nine like Fif'
How are niggas s'posed to love you niggas?
Heart beatin' fast when I dap and when I hug you niggas
Drake told me not to trust you niggas
Your energy off, you're finicky, I rush you niggas
Just walkin' 'round the crib like, ""Why a nigga can't live?
Get this money, fuck these bitches though?""
Thinkin' 'bout the beef like:
""We can pass these mothafuckin' straps like a physical""
This my city, nigga, everybody know it
Ridin' 'round town, just me and my four-pound
Tucked in my Tom Fords, hopin' I ain't gotta show it
L.A. niggas be the craziest, these niggas do some shady shit
Niggas'll run up on your car, catch you off guard
Like the Lil Wayne and Baby shit, 40, I'm fucked up

Y'all better not come to my studio with that fake shit
Y'all better not come to my funeral with that fake shit
Y'all better off realizin' there's nothin' that y'all could do wit' me
All I ever asked is keep it eight more than 92 with me, one hunnid
L.A. niggas be the craziest, yeah, one hunnid
L.A., all I ever asked is one hunnid
L.A., L.A. niggas be the craziest, one hunnid
All I ever asked is one

Thank me later, thanks for nothin', thanks for bluffin'
Thank you so, so much for wearin' your true colors
To every single fuckin' function
Had niggas tell me to my face how we were family
And how they love me while they were skimmin' off the budget
Now, when I see 'em, they're the ones that's actin' funny
People been reachin' out to me
And I'm on some straight unresponsive shit
I would have so many friends
If I didn't have money, respect and accomplishments
I would have so many friends
If I held back the truth and I just gave out compliments
I would have all of your fans
If I didn't go pop and I stayed on some conscious shit
I would have so many more friends
If I lost my success and my confidence
I'm in the club every time that they play the competition
If they even play the competition and I seen the response they get
Yeah, nobody's even hearin' it, on top of the pyramid
Might go to Jamaica, disappear again
My circle got so small that it's a period, sayin' to myself

Y'all better not come to my studio with that fake shit
Y'all better not come to my funeral with that fake shit
Y'all better off realizin' there's nothin' that y'all could do wit' me
All I ever asked is keep it eight more than 92 with me, one hunnid
L.A. niggas be the craziest, yeah, one hunnid
L.A., all I ever asked is one hunnid
L.A., L.A. niggas be the craziest, one hunnid
All I ever asked is one

Miss 4 Cent, that was my real nigga
Held a nigga down since he was a lil' nigga
If he was still alive, he would kill niggas
He was Lil' Snupe, I was Meek Mill
Niggas know how it feel when you missin' your nigga though
Can't think, so you roll up that indigo
Stressin' while drivin' down Figuero'
Blowin' kush clouds until his ghost is in my Ghost, damn
Make a real nigga wanna give his life to God like, ""Here it go""
Screamin' Frog name at the clouds, they don't hear me though
Guess they too busy with 2Pac and Biggie though
You niggas don't feel me though
That was on Suge's watch, I'll take Suge's watch
You dissin' Drizzy, that's cool, but don't come to my city though
Not even to H-Town
So underground that I gotta be a trill nigga
Strapped up from the waist down
That's word to Pimp C, J Prince is my real nigga
Shit was so simple when Henchman was out
He had a young nigga right there with Meech
So happy when Bleu Davinci got out
We came up on these California streets
L.A. niggas be the craziest, these niggas do some shady shit
Niggas'll run up on your car, catch you off guard
Like the Lil Wayne and Baby shit
Got a nigga confused, but why a nigga gotta choose?
Don't even matter, dawg, cause I'ma always be a real nigga
Always be a real nigga
I never learned how to be nothin' but a real nigga

Y'all better not come to my studio with that fake shit
Y'all better not come to my funeral with that fake shit
Y'all better off realizin' there's nothin' that y'all could do wit' me
All I ever asked is keep it eight more than 92 with me, one hunnid

Ali Bomaye,Jesus Piece,2012.0,"Get my people out them chains, nigga
I mean handcuffs, time to man up
Put my hands up? Fuck you sayin', bruh?
'Cause I'm a black man in a Phantom
Or is it 'cause my windows tinted?
Car cost 300 thou' and I blow Indo in it
You mad 'cause your daughter fuck with me on spring break
Well, I'ma fuck her till the springs break

Yeah, roll another one 'cause I'm winnin'
In my four-door, lookin' real photogenic
Gentleman attire, in threads that won't expire
I'm in a class of my own, my teacher got fired
Money gettin' long, pussy rate keep risin'
Versace outfit cost me 3,000
From the P houses, did it from the wee hours
Sellin' that chicken; no lemon pepper, no sweet and sour
First you get the power, then you get respect
I'm gettin' so much money I can buy your bitch
Take it how you wanna, if you wanna take it
I like clubs where all the women workin' naked
Fell in love with a waitress—what the fuck I'm thinkin'?
Bought that ho a ring, it was for her pinky
Uhn, that's pimpin', that's slick
Got a bottle of cologne that cost more than your rent

Fuck y'all mad at me for? Got a black card and a black Phantom
With a white bitch in Idaho, I do the same thing in (Montana)
Got a thick bitch in Atlanta, got a redbone in the Chi
Got two chains, they two-tone, two hundred racks, no lie

Ali Bomaye! Ali Bomaye!
I'm 'bout to rumble in the jungle in these new Kanye's
Ali Bomaye! Ali Bomaye!
My lawyer threw them gloves on and beat another case

Fuck y'all mad at me for, 'cause my belt got two G's on it?
Her bag got two C's on it? My daughter's stroller got D's on it?
Free Big Meech, free Boosie and C-Murder
Like New Orleans, like Baltimore, come to Compton you'll see murders
And my AR see murders, that's beef, nigga; no burgers
I'm insane and you Usain, nigga better turn on them burners
Got coke swimmin' in that glass jar, bitch, go turn on them burners!
Got dope to sell in this hotel, no half price, no retail
You a bitch nigga; no female, I smack niggas; Sprewell
I'm on the block like D12, I got the white; no D-12
Like a little nigga in Africa, I was born totin' that K
And that's real shit, no Will Smith and no Nona Gaye
But they yellin'…

Ali Bomaye! Ali Bomaye!
Thank God that a nigga seen another day
Ali Bomaye! Ali Bomaye!
Got a chopper and a bottle—fuck it, let 'em spray!

I take my case to trial, hire the Dream Team
Robbie Kardashian, Johnnie Cochran; I seen things
I dream big, I think sharp
Inhale smoke, Hawaiian tree bark
Humble yourself, you not a G, keep it one with yourself
Run to niggas for help, favors I keep one on the shelf
I got rifles with lasers, swing it just like the majors
Hit you right above navel
Now you swimmin' in pavement
Gold medals on my neck, I call it Michael Phelps
Hoes settlin' for less, I call 'em bottom shelf
Niggas tough on them blogs and never did nothin' at all
On the road to the riches, bitches not taggin' along

Unless it's ass in a thong, hit that ass and I'm gone
Disrespect my nigga Boss and I'm flashin' the chrome
I'm wavin' the TEC, Tity sprayin' the MAC
Extendos in the back, gonna lap
I got a bitch that look like Laila Ali sittin' in my lap
Got a call from Skateboard, pick 'em up at LAX
Speakin' skateboards, where Tune at? Fuck with him
I'll break a skateboard on a nigga back, 2 Chainz!

Skateboard on a nigga track
No lie, ""No Lie"" already got a plaque
Mama got a house, daughter got accounts
Just to think a nigga like me started with a ounce
Bad bitches and D-boys, we bring 'em out
If them niggas pussy, we douche 'em, we clean 'em out
This the voice of ghetto intelligence. If you got work
Go to work, don't work at your residence

…For presidents
Word to Muhammad, that triple beam is heaven-sent
Ridin' through the jungles in that mothafuckin' elephant
That's a gray Ghost, with the ears on it
Swimmin' through the hood like it got fins on it (Tell 'em!)
You know I got that work on the foreman grill
Weigh the mothafuckas in, made another mil
Got a nigga feelin' like Cassius Clay
Thrilla in Manilla, nigga want it, whip his ass today

Ali Bomaye! Ali Bomaye!
Thank God that a nigga seen another day
Ali Bomaye! Ali Bomaye!
Got a chopper and a bottle—fuck it, let 'em spray!

Ay, nigga guess what I just picked up?
Nigga, talk to yo nigga
Ay, my fuckin' Jesus piece! (Woo)
Ay, ay, ay nigga, nigga look at ya boy! Look at ya boy!
Ay nigga look, look real quick, real quick, look at Jesus eyes doe

Martians vs. Goblins,The R.E.D. Album,2011.0,"1500
Mars..
(Bitch I'm a motherfuckin' martian)

Blood gang kill 'em all, Odd Future Wolf Gang
Kidnap a vampire, drain all his fuckin veins
Wolf Grey Jordans, use his intestines for the strings
Snatch up Rihanna and throw her in front of a fuckin' train
Sniff a fucking unemployment line of cocaine
Tie Lil B up to a full tank of propane
Swag, now watch him cook...and just stand there and look
Have a bonfire with old Harry Potter books
Martians vs. Goblins, goons vs. the crooks
And since me and Tune had Viacom shook
I shoulda got a real-ass pirate to do the hook
Maybe Jack Sparrow maybe Peter Pan's nemesis
My power's limitless like Blanka on Sega Genesis
Superhero, mad that Marvel overlooked me
Cause Spiderman and Hulk straight pussy

Bitch I'm a muthafuckin Martian (I'm a goddamn Goblin)
Bitch I'm a muthafuckin Martian (I'm a goddamn Goblin)
Bitch I'm a muthafuckin Martian (I'm a goddamn Goblin)
We are not the same, I am a Martian

A year ago, I was poor, somewhat
Now my future's brighter than Christopher's new haircut
Bruno Mars is still sucking dick and fucking male butts
In the same closet that Tyler Perry gets clothes from
I suck? Where the fuckin Ring Pops?
You got a better chance of getting a copy of Detox
Wolf Gang, we rock, crack rock and that shit was expected
Like Jayceon whenever he name-drop (Fuck you, Tyler)
Jesus, motherfucking Theresa
This nigga Game got Wolf Haley for this feature
My team is running shit like we have full-cleat Adidas
Getting chased by the polices on a full bred Cheetah
Bishop Eddie caught me tryna escape
Bag full of drag and a Nicki Minaj mixtape
Dragging all you fags to the back of the log cabin
Fall back like Lebron's hairline against the Mavericks, he lost

Bitch I'm a muthafuckin Martian (I'm a goddamn Goblin)
Bitch I'm a muthafuckin Martian (I'm a goddamn Goblin)
Bitch I'm a muthafuckin Martian (I'm a goddamn Goblin)
We are not the same, I am a Martian

(Chuck, fuck wit' me) I do
Cause Lil Tunechi always bless me (achoo)
He killed me on my own track, so what? Not you
Fuck you, I spit like I had kids with Erykah Badu
I fucked her on the day of that naked video shoot
I was sucking that pussy like it was wonton soup
Then I hit Lebron's mom in bron-bron's coupe
With Delonte West taping, we had bon-bons too
With Cleveland cheerleaders, they had pom-poms too
So I smacked them bitches wearing Bishop Don Juan's suit
(Where was Snoop?) I don't know, probably doing what the Crips do
But when I'm with my uncle, fuck it! Then I'm a Crip too
And I will Crip Weezy, Crip Jones, and Crip you
Now I'm the Doggfather, walking with a Shih Tzu
Mad that DC comics overlooked me
Cause Captain America's straight pussy

Bitch I'm a muthafuckin Martian (I'm a goddamn Goblin)
Bitch I'm a muthafuckin Martian (I'm a goddamn Goblin)
Bitch I'm a muthafuckin Martian (I'm a goddamn Goblin)
We are not the same, I am a Martian",https://genius.com/The-game-martians-vs-goblins-lyrics
Hate It or Love It,The Documentary,2005.0,"Yeah, let's take 'em back
Uh-huh

Coming up I was confused, my mommy kissing a girl
Confusion occurs coming up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around, probably out committing felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing, ""Check, check out my melody""
I wanna live good so, shit, I sell dope
For a four finger ring, one of them gold ropes
Nana told me if I passed I'd get a sheepskin coat
If I can move a few packs I'd get the hat, now that'd be dope
Tossed and turned in my sleep that night
Woke up the next morning, niggas had stole my bike
Different day, same shit, ain't nothing good in the hood
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could
[Chorus: 50 Cent & 
The Game
]
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me

(G-G-G-G-G-Unit!) On the grill of my lowrider
Guns on both sides, right above the gold wires
I'll fo'-five 'em, kill a nigga on my song
And really do it, that's the true meaning of a ghostwriter
10 G's will take your daughter out her Air Forces
Believe in me, homie, I know all about losses
I'm from Compton, wear the wrong colors, be cautious
One phone call'll have your body dumped in Marcy
I stay strapped like car seats
Been bangin' since my lil' nigga Rob got killed for his Barkleys
That's 10 years, I told Pooh in '95
I'll kill you if you try me for my Air Max 95's
Told Banks when I met him I'ma ride
And if I gotta die, I'd rather homicide
I ain't have 50 cent when my grandmama died
Now I'm going back to Cali
With my Jacob on, see how time fly?
[Chorus: 50 Cent & 
The Game
]
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me

From the beginning to the end
Losers lose, winners win
This is real, we ain't got to pretend
The cold world that we in is full of pressure and pain
Enough of me, nigga, now listen to Game

Used to see Five-O, throw the crack by the bench
Now I'm fuckin' with 5-0, it's all starting to make sense
My mom's happy, she ain't gotta pay the rent
And she got a red bow on that brand new Benz
Waiting on Sha Money to land, sitting in the Range
Thinking how they spent 30 million dollars on airplanes
When there's kids starvin'
Pac is gone and Brenda still throwing babies in the garbage
I wanna know what's going on like I hear Marvin
No schoolbooks, they used that wood to build coffins
Whenever I'm in the booth and I get exhausted
I think, ""What if Marie Baker got that abortion?"" 
I love you, ma
[Chorus: 50 Cent & 
The Game
]
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop

See any angels in the city
See any angels in the city

Tell them mothafuckas I'm forever paid
California king, wrestle gators in the Everglades
Drive up out that mothafuckin' swamp in the Escalade
So before you put that red rag in your pocket
I wanna see your fuckin' résumé
Started off on Ground Zero, then I start to levitate
Rip rappers a new asshole – I never hesitate
Dre Beats on, smokin' that chronic just to meditate
I'ma give 'em hurricanes until another levee break
You niggas is featherweights, I'm Aftermath's heavyweight
Now Dre's weapon of mass destruction is 'bout to detonate
When a nigga Wack found me, shit, I was sellin' weight
Now a nigga's sellin' millions, now it's time to celebrate
Performin' in front of millions, nigga, every race
64 in the '64, now watch the Chevy scrape
Fourth album, no five mics? Then let 'em hate!
But I'm not stoppin' till I'm the fuckin' king in every state

Recognize my life, ridicule my fight
Give me fuel for the fire burnin' when I yearn these lights
In the midst of the hieroglyphs my fingertips start to write
Get familiar with Cartwright, ‘cause I want that shot
I'm a raging bull when the needle drops
For the record, I'ma wreck it, even if my record don't pop
I'ma tie a knot on a downtown buildin'
Let it tow behind me, tell 'em they can find me
In the dark with the ghetto children
Look at my heart, nigga, fuck your feelings, this is me

I'm sick of mothafuckas talkin' about ""the West died""
Can't you hear my heart beatin'? That's the motherfuckin' Westside
You test me, you test God, I'm His son
It say in Psalms, you come at me
Then I can split you with this Tommy gun
You won't have no time to run
I'm from the Compton slums, and that's how the West ride
I'm from the city where two of the best died
Rest in peace to both of 'em, spit like I'm the ghost of 'em
Damn, I said I spit like I'm the ghost of 'em
Name your top 10, I'm harder than the most of 'em
Matter of fact, shorten your list, nigga, top 5
Game, Biggie, Hov… probably Pac, Nas
No particular order, bet a mill' that I slaughter
Serve niggas, give a fuck what you ordered
How dare you niggas pop fly, when I'm the nigga?
Sold 5 mill' out the gate, and numbers do not lie

Recognize my life, ridicule my fight
Give me fuel for the fire burnin' when I yearn these lights
In the midst of the hieroglyphs my fingertips start to write
Get familiar with Cartwright, ‘cause I want that shot
I'm a raging bull when the needle drops
For the record, I'ma wreck it, even if my record don't pop
I'ma tie a knot on a downtown buildin'
Let it tow behind me, tell 'em they can find me
In the dark with the ghetto children
Look at my heart, nigga, fuck your feelings, this is me

I gave you The Documentary, shit was a classic
Gave you Doctor's Advocate, you ripped it out the package
Came with LAX, since critics said it was average
I was stressed the fuck out, torn between Aftermath and
Geffen, Interscope, now I got you in the scope
Spill the red ink on the paper, it's like my pen is broke
And this is what you all been waitin' for
I'm the lost angel knockin' on Satan's door
What the fuck y'all take me for?
I love you ‘cause you hate me more
I'm Kobe on the Lakers floor, except I give you 84
Shake you like Haiti's floor
Walk up on you, like, ""What's goin' on, baby boy?""
Shots in that Mercedes door
Either I'm crazy or the black Slim Shady or
Could that be the reason that Baby said he would pay me more?
But I still owe Jimmy one more album
The best the West has ever seen, no disrespect to Calvin

Recognize my life, ridicule my fight
Give me fuel for the fire burnin' when I yearn these lights
In the midst of the hieroglyphs my fingertips start to write
Get familiar with Cartwright, ‘cause I want that shot
I'm a raging bull when the needle drops
For the record, I'ma wreck it, even if my record don't pop
I'ma tie a knot on a downtown buildin'
Let it tow behind me, tell 'em they can find me
In the dark with the ghetto children
Look at my heart, nigga, fuck your feelings, this is me

Kendrick, and I wear pendant on my shoulder
Soldier, like a lieutenant
And the coupe tinted, got pulled over
Johnny always lock a nigga down, knowin' damn well
We don't wanna see the box like Manny Pacquiao
Little nigga Mayweather size
Ride like Pac in his prime; Thug Life is now on radar
'Til the federal come through and raid ours
Reminiscin' when the L.A. Raiders
Was in my home, snapback fitted on my uncle's dome
And I don't condone dickridin'
I'm addicted to Westsidin'
Livin' in a city where the skinny niggas die
And the semi bullets fly, but it turned me to a lion
Tryin'… and I mean that shit
Game came through, put the city on his back
I was in the city where a nigga hadn't seen that shit
""Compton!"" – a nigga gotta scream that shit
Never went commercial, never TV-screened that shit
Can't block or screen that shit
Now everybody sing that shit!

Red is a very emotionally and intense color. It enhances human metabolism, increases respiration rate, and raises blood pressure. It has a very high visibility, which is why stop signs, stop lights, and fire equipments are usually painted red. It also represents one third of California's gang population. Needless to say, please dress accordingly while visiting the Los Angeles area. Also, tuck your jewellry, and keep your hands inside your vehicle. Thank you!

My Life,LAX,2008.0,"Punk-ass motherfucker, checkin' shit
What you was gonna do?
Kill me in my sleep, you bitch-ass nigga?
2Pac, Biggie – shut the fuck up!
Fuckin' dogs, barkin' and shit
(Don't shoot, don't shoot!)
Fuck you, nigga!

And I'm grindin' till I'm tired
‘Cause they said: ""You ain't grindin' till you tired.""
So I'm grindin' with my eyes wide
Lookin' to find a way through the day, a light for the night
Dear Lord, you done took so many of my people
I'm just wonderin' why you haven't taken my life
Like what the hell am I doin' right? My life

Take me away from the hood, like a state penitentiary
Take me away from the hood, in a casket or a Bentley
Take me away, like I overdosed on cocaine
Or take me away like a bullet from Kurt Cobain, suicide
I'm from a windy city like Do or Die
From a block close to where Biggie was crucified
That was Brooklyn's Jesus, shot for no fuckin' reason
And you wonder why Kanye wears Jesus pieces?
‘Cause that's Jesus, people – and Game, he's the equal
Hated on so much, Passion of Christ need a sequel
Yeah, like Roc-a-Fella needed Siegel
Like I needed my father, but he needed a needle
I need some meditation so I can lead my people
They askin', ""Why, why did John Lennon leave The Beatles?""
And why every hood nigga feed off evil?
Answer my question 'fore this bullet leave this Desert Eagle

And I'm grindin' till I'm tired
‘Cause they said: ""You ain't grindin' till you tired.""
So I'm grindin' with my eyes wide
Lookin' to find a way through the day, a light for the night
Dear Lord, you done took so many of my people
I'm just wonderin' why you haven't taken my life
Like what the hell am I doin' right? My life

We are not the same, I am a Martian
So approach my Phantom doors with caution
You see them 24s spinnin'? I earned 'em
And I ain't no preacher, but here's my Erick Sermon
So eat this black music and tell me how it taste now
And fuck Jesse Jackson, ‘cause it ain't about race now
Sometimes I think about my life, with my face down
Then I see my sons and put on that Kanye smile
Damn, I know his mama proud; and since you helped me sell my dream, we can share my mama now
And like M.J.B. no more drama now
Livin' the good life, me and Common on common ground
I spit crack, and niggas could drive it out of town
Got a Chris Paul mindstate, I'm never out of bounds
My life used to be empty like a Glock without a round
Now my life full like a chopper with a thousand rounds

And I'm grindin' till I'm tired
‘Cause they said: ""You ain't grindin' till you tired.""
So I'm grindin' with my eyes wide
Lookin' to find a way through the day, a light for the night
Dear Lord, you done took so many of my people
I'm just wonderin' why you haven't taken my life
Like what the hell am I doin' right? My life

Walk through the gates of hell, see my Impala parked in front
With the high beams on, me and the devil sharin' chronic blunts
Listenin' to the Chronic album, playin' backwards
Shootin' at pictures of Don Imus for target practice
My mind fucked up, so I cover it with a Raider hood
I'm from the city that made you motherfuckers afraid of Suge (Compton, Compton)
Made my grandmother pray for good
It never made her happy, but I bet that new Mercedes could
Ain't no bars, but niggas can't escape the hood
And it took so many of my niggas that I should hate the hood
But it's real niggas like me that make the hood
Ridin' slow in that Phantom just the way I should
With the top back, in my Sox hat
I'm paid in full, the nigga Alpo couldn't stop that
Even if they brought the nigga Pac back
I'd still keep this motherfucker cocked back

And I'm grindin' till I'm tired
‘Cause they said: ""You ain't grindin' till you tired.""
So I'm grindin' with my eyes wide
Lookin' to find a way through the day, a light for the night

This, is, how, we, do
We make a move and act a fool while we up in the club
This, is, how, we, do
Nobody do it like we do it so show us some love

Fresh like, uhh, Impala, uhh
Chrome hydraulics, 808, drums
You don't want, none, nigga better, run
When beef is on, I'll pop that, trunk
Come get, some, pistol grip, pump
If a nigga step on my white Air, Ones
It's red-rum, ready, here it come
Compton, uhh, Dre found me in the slums
Sellin' that skunk, one hand on my gun
I was sellin' rocks when Master P was sayin' ""Uhhhh!""
Buck pass the blunt
These G-Unit girls just wanna have, fun
Coke and rum, got weed on the ton
I'm bangin' with my hand up her dress like, uhh
I'll make her cum, purple haze in my lungs
Whole gang in the front in case a nigga wanna stunt

I put Lamborghini doors on that Escalade
Low pro, so low look like I'm ridin' on blades
In one year mayne, a nigga so paid
I have a straight bitch in the telly goin' both ways (ahh!)
Touch me, tease me, kiss me, please me
I give it to you just how you like it, girl
You're now rockin' with the best
Tre pound on my hip, Teflon on my chest
They say I'm no good, cause I'm so hood
Rich folks do not want me around
'Cause shit might pop off, and if shit pop off
Somebody gon' get laid the fuck out
They call me new money, say I have no class
I'm from the bottom, I came up too fast
The hell if I care, I'm just here to get my cash
Bougie-ass bitches, you can kiss my ass

This, is, how, we do
We make a move and act a fool while we up in the club

Nobody do it like we do it so show us some love

I put gold Daytonas on that cherry six-fo'
White walls so clean, look like I'm ridin' on Vogues
Hit one switch mayne, that ass so low
Cali got niggas in New York ridin' on hundred spokes
Touch me, tease me, kiss me, please me
I give it to you just how you like it, girl
You're now rockin' with the best
Four pound on my hip, gold chain on my chest (ahh!)
50, uhh, Bentley, uhh
Em came and got a nigga fresh out the slum
Automatic, gun, fuck 'em one-on-one
We wrap up your punk ass, stunt and you done
Homie, it's Game time! You ready? Here it come
Call Lloyd Banks and get this motherfucker, crunk
It took two, months, but 50 got it done
Signed with G-Unit, had niggas like, ""Huh?""
Don't try to front, I'll leave your ass, slumped
Thinkin' I'm a punk get your fuckin' head, lumped
50 got a, gun! Ready? Here it come
Got a sick ven-detta to get this, cheddar

She a rockstar, bring the heavy metal in
Girl shaped like a coke bottle, Medellín
In love with her 'til she went and let the devil in
She pop pills like medicine
She probably gon' die, it's startin' to be evident
I told her, ""Slow down, girl you're heaven-sent""
I'm a thug but I got a heart like Kev and them
And I can't let this girl throw her life away
Kick her dorm room in and told her put the knife away
Took her to the hospital like right away
She a angel with demons, the girl like night and day
Stressed out, parents getting divorced
Girl love 'em both, she ain't tryin' to sit in court
She a square so it's hard to see the angle
And that's why God gave her an guardian angel
It's me, and I'm here for her, swear to God that I'm here for her
Last nigga got her caught up in the airport
She ain't had no pride, so she went and did a year for him
She a ride-or-die, like Eve and them
Make home-cooked meals every evening
Start stripping on the side, now I'm tipping on the side
Love life like Joselin and Stevie and them
Am I wrong for being the best that I can to her?
Takin' her son and tryin' to be a man to him
She don't wanna pray, but I told her put her hands to it
I done came a long way from that tan Buick
Yeah, grandmother would be proud of me
Almost got the devil all the way the fuck out of me
Remember momma knockin' on the door hounding me
Bought her a car and a crib even though she doubted me

I'm the only one who cut and still came back to stitch you up
So we fuck, say what? You ain't been home lately

He beat her ass in the crib then he went and did a bid

Can you tame me?

And um, you got a body, you remind of my Jeep
And um, I must look amazing with you

You wear that body suit, I know you tryna tease me
I put on that Tiller, she'd rather fuck me to Weezy
I remember when your money was young

Three years later the album is done
Aftermath presents: 
Nigga Witta Attitude, Volume One
Rap critics politickin', wanna know the outcome
Ready to Die
, 
Reasonable Doubt
, and 
Doggystyle
 in one
I feel like 'Pac after the Snoop Dogg trial was done
Dre behind that G series and All Eyez on Me
I watched the death of a dynasty, so I told Vibe Magazine
Workin' with Dr. Dre was a

""Dream""

I had visions of makin a classic, then my world turned black
Like I was starin' out of Stevie Wonder's glasses
It's kinda hard to imagine, like Kanye West
Coming back from his fatal accident to beatmakin' and rappin'
But, we the future, Whitney Houston told me that
It's gon' take more than a bullet in the heart to hold me back

I had dreams of fuckin' a R&B bitch like Mya
When I saw that ass on the front of that King
Read the article in the magazine, she loved gangsters, loved nasty things
So I'm in the glass house having nasty dreams
Good girls never give it up
But anything is possible, if 50 fucked Vivica
Hurdled life's obstacles, found my way through the maze
Then joy turned to pain like Frankie Beverly and Maze
Used to dream of being Unsigned Hype
'Til I was crushed by Dave Mays, almost let my pen fall asleep on the page
Daydreamin' yesterday, dozin' off backstage
I thought I saw Eazy talking to Jam Master Jay
So I walked over, heard Jam Master say
""It's a hard knock life, then you pass away""
They say sleep is the cousin of death, so my eyes wide open

Who walked through the White House without a business suit
Compton hat, jheri curl drippin' on Ronald Reagan's shoes
Gave Mike Lem my demo, came here to pay my dues
Started off with Whoo Kid, then I start blazin' Clue
It was all a dream like Big said it'd be
Don't sleep on me homey, I bring nightmares to reality
Rap phenomenon, defyin' the rules of gravity
Studied all the classics, start revisin' my strategy
'Cause Marshall Mathers made it, Curtis Jackson made it
Head in the clouds, wonderin' where the hell Marvin Gaye went
How do I say this? I'm livin' for my son
But I can't figure out, why I'm at my temple with this gun
Wake up to a Jesus piece, like a catholic nun
The war to be a rap legend has just begun

The Documentary,The Documentary,2005.0,"Bitch, I want my mother fuckin' money back
You only gave me five dollars!
I gave you twenty mother fuckin' dollars!
No, you didn't! You only gave me five dollars!
No, I gave you twenty and I ain't gon' sit here and argue with your flat-ass face, home girl
This is America!
You know, that's the thing about you mother fuckers
Go home!
I ain't goin' no where 'til I get my mother fuckin' change
I will blow this mother fucker up if I don't get my mother fuckin' change
*Speaking Japanese*
*Mocking Japanese*
I want my mother fuckin' change!

What happened in hip-hop that got Pac and Big shot?
The thicks blocks, now every rapper claim he let his clip pop
But even myself tote a gun, and know to run than get shot
I've been there before now I'm fuckin' with Doc
(Dr. Dre: Gotta do them Calvin Broadus numbers)
If not, I pitch rocks, anticipatin' my incarceration
Media think I'm fakin' like Mason, but when it comes to mace
Fuck R. Kelly, I don't take it in the face
I find out who sprayed it, and I'm puttin' you under the pavement
No Buddhist priest, Catholic, or Baptist pastor can save him
I'm far from religious, but I got beliefs
So I put canary yellow diamonds in my Jesus piece
I came back from the dead without a part of my chest
Laid in a hospital bed on cardiac arrest
I waited for 3 years while everybody else dropped
Now I understand why Nas did a song with his pops

I'm Ready To Die without a Reasonable Doubt
Smoke Chronic and hit it Doggystyle before I go out
Until they sign my Death Certificate, All Eyez On Me
I'm still at it, Illmatic, and that's The Documentary
Ready To Die without a Reasonable Doubt
Smoke Chronic and hit it Doggystyle before I go out
Until they sign my Death Certificate, All Eyez On Me
I'm still at it, Illmatic, and that's The Documentary

If I die my niggas
Fuck it, I did a song with Mary Blige, my niggas
Got a hook from Faith, no verse from Jay
I guess on Westside Story he thought I spit in his face
Told Ed Lover & Moni Love I was talkin' to Ja
With that Maybach line, it was payback time
Keep fuckin' with me nigga, I'll put you under me
Take your car and trade it in for eight 3 hundred C's
If you cross my T, I'll dot your eyes
You'll do life in a cemetery, I'll do mine with Shyne
Come home sit in the throne with my legs crossed
And my Air Forces, middle finger up, fuck the world
'Cause I'm feelin' like Puff when Life After Death hit
Mo' money, mo' problems and I lost my best friend
I'm the second dopest nigga from Compton you'll ever hear
The first nigga only put out albums every 7 years

(You know what speaking of Jay
That just makes me roll down
Now your song Westside Story)
Uh Oh
(You got a line that says
""I don't do button up shirts
Or drive Maybachs""
Is that a shot at Jay?)
Nah, I was talkin' about Ja Rule
Yeah, so, I mean, I just-I-I got a lot of respect for Jay
You know what I'm sayin'?
I never take shots at legends
I just-that's just somethin' I don't do

Let me tell you why I do this shit
I'm a son of a gun 'cause moms was a Hoover Crip
First day I got signed, I had to prove I spit
Freestyle with Busta Rhymes (Busta: son, duke is sick)
The protégé of Doc Dre, I could finally put the shoes on
Now that the rumors of Rakim and Cube gone
They say truth hurts, sunk like quicksand
Don't stop me in traffic and ask about Hittman
I gotta restore the feelin' that crawled from under the rock
After Tha Dogg Pound crushed the buildings
I got a family to feed, I'm the middle of 9 children
We can talk about a loan after I sell 5 million
If I tell you I ain't Game and I don't know Dre
You goin' do me like Xzibit and cut half my face?
I take all the credit for puttin' the West back on the map
If you ain't feelin' that, guess I'm Guerrilla Black

I'm Ready To Die without a Reasonable Doubt
Smoke Chronic and hit it Doggystyle before I go out
Until they sign my Death Certificate, All Eyez On Me
I'm still at it, Illmatic, and that's The Documentary
Ready To Die without a Reasonable Doubt

All That (Lady),Jesus Piece,2012.0,"You know I love you like cooked food, I'm a good dude
Let's hit the Roscoe's on Pico, I'm in a hood mood
I'm sittin' here thinkin' 'bout all the things I could do
So what you should do is play your position for Birkin bags
We poppin' tags, her shoe game sick
We drinkin' Ace out of red bottles, true gang shit
Fuck with me and you're famous
Kanye'd my bitch, now she’s away from the nameless
Camera flashes from strangers, turn a Range to a manger
Jesus piece on the plates, yeah my baby an angel
Fell straight up out of Heaven into what we into
Who knew we'd grew into, whatever we into
That's too much for your mental, so we snapback that
Game on point like the stripes on my Gucc backpack
My ladybug, yea she cool like that
In them Trues, why you move like that

You know my lady always on
She know I need it so
She know she can get
All that, all that, all that, all that, all that
My lady got me going
I'm where she already knows
She know she can get
All that, all that, all that

Uh, you my lady
And that pussy feel like a haven
We can make babies, let's be creative
She say leave them tricks alone but I’m a skater
I love her like her daddy told her no man would
I got a lot of bad bitches, she the only one good
I get her flowers for nothing, she smiling and blushing
If I don't answer my phone, then we probably fucking, and yeah
She love my tattoos
Ain't got no room for her name but I'ma make room
She let her hair down, we have a stare down
She said ""I'm glad you ate it,"" where my cap & gown?
Told her, ""I can be your chauffeur"", dick like a limo
Multiple orgasms, that’s my M.O., haha
Redbone pretty
I kiss her from her titty to her clitty, Tunechi

You know my lady always on
She know I need it so
She know she can get
All that, all that, all that, all that, all that
My lady got me going
I'm where she already knows
She know she can get
All that, all that, all that

Sean Don, whoa
Look, my girl's sweet like my hotel floor
From where they ran through more keys than a hotel door
Indeed, give her the D now the whole hotel know
Feel like I'm looking down from Heaven
Screaming, ""Oh, Hell no!""
When you hop on top, girl, that's what it feel like
She always had a player back like them field lights
And every time I left it ain't feel right
Cheated on her and she stayed, that's just real life (shit)
Cause it's hard when you ain't on the same coast
Burning bread in the club so all these girls want toast
Hoes try and wade but we ain't on the same boat
They trying to sink everything that we made float
She told me 'bout her ex man, her old boy stories
And how she had a dildo, you know, toy stories
Don't fuck her on her period, ain't into horror stories
I take her to my favorite restaurant, she order for me
'Cause she know me

You know my lady always on
She know I need it so
She know she can get
All that, all that, all that, all that, all that
My lady got me going
I'm where she already knows
She know she can get
All that, all that, all that

It make sense right, yeah
Girl look, I'm feeling your style
I'm loving your swag
I like how your jeans fit

See No Evil,Jesus Piece,2012.0,"I don't read the XXL
Tote a .45 at the church, think I'm destined for hell, oh well
Blood tears off the face of my Jesus Piece
It's bloodshed, feel the cracks in my city streets
I'm from the crack of them city streets
Used to sell crack in them city streets, born in Blood, nigga
In a coma five days, life of a thug nigga
Momma ain't show, grandma almost pulled the plug nigga
Used to pull the gun out, just because of cuz niggas
Five shots to the head 'cause I'm a Blood nigga
Nuttin' brewing but suwoo'ing where the fuck I'm from
You lucky if you make it out of Compton, ask Andre Young
Smell the scent of dead bodies ridin' down Green Leaf
No peace so don't get caught up with no piece
Fuck Fatburger, we cooking that real beef
Mommas mourning they sons, I'm talking real grief
Real funerals of them lost Juveniles
Trying to be generals, be missing your dinner now, huh
Say its a blessing when you die in ya sleep
'Cause the coroner don't need no sheets, capisce?
I'm sayin', stop playing, wrap him up in what he lay in
Fold a nigga arms, now a casket what he pray in
Compton streets raised me
Can't tell my grandma nothing 'bout her baby, you crazy

I said she see no evil, she don't hear nothing at all
You want to see tomorrow, you promise not to talk
Say we on our way now, I'ma see you again
And when they ask you questions, you just answer
What happened then? What happened then?

I live this life at a pace that anyone can go
Know your place and dedicate your role, to the faith that you'll die alone
Trace your steps when I do step in a fire of broken bones
And I require my heart's desire and when I reap what I sew
I bought my momma a Benz, my boobie a Jag
A car for my dogs, with a roof full of glass
But still I be feeling like none of my light never casts
Out of that black cloud that's been watered down since my first chopper blast
But fuck that, I'm not worried, even when it's scary
Skrrt off makin' them hurt off I should have hurt them in a hurry
Dirt off all under my fingers, dirt all of 'em gon is gone is burried
Shirt off when precedure, resuscitation came early
I need you to keep quiet as a mouse
Which is ironic 'cause rats is what I'm talking about
I'm hearin the sonics of gun fire
The whispers, the silent cries
Even though I know it's an eye for an eye

I said she see no evil, she don't hear nothing at all
You want to see tomorrow, you promise not to talk
Say we on our way now, I'mma see you again
And when they ask you questions, you just answer
What happened then? What happened then?

I was born a soldier, ride or die for mine
Tattooed tears and a lawyer, tried to give me life
Heaven can you hear me? 'Cause I know that hell can
So heaven can you heal me? I'm only just a man, oh

You want to go to Compton? Nigga I'll take you there
Hub City bodies get burnt butt-naked here
Respect the code, a nigga's calling from the pen
Colombian neck-ties on the outside from within
And then, your momma never see you again
Casket to never wake up plastered in MAC make-up, huh
Niggas can’t hear you talking from the sky
And only five year olds see your ghost when you die, no lie
Karma catches up to all you head honchos
2 dome shots in that head, Griselda Blanco
Shit get real though inside the Foxhills though
Nigga living that fast life and get killed slow
Ask Wack and Draws if a nigga run the streets
My grandmother’s prayers saved you niggas I never wanted peace
Los Angeles, I’m the motherfucking King here
No first 48 'cause muh'fuckers don’t sing here, huh

I said she see no evil, she don't hear nothing at all
You want to see tomorrow, you promise not to talk
Say we on our way now, I'ma see you again

92 Bars,1992,2016.0,"This that sick rap, kick back, come to where I pitch at
Where bitches love The Game like Tyson Beckford six pack
Presidential Rollie, nigga, where your wrist at?
I can kill you in four bars, that's a Kit Kat
Did the Lambo my way with a sick wrap
Smooth as Frank Sinatra with a motherfucking slick back
No rats in my pack, ain't no wrinkles in my slacks
Counting singles in my Shaqs, stacking Pringles from the crack
Nigga I was on the bus with it
Had 12 stuck to my chest in the field with the colt
Andrew Luck with it
We had the rock, hit the block like what's up with it
Jay was in the Z, my young gunnas in the truck with it
Sigel would've loved it, Philly would've fucked with it
California state property you niggas stuck with it
Brrrring, sold Peedi Crakk
Game was on the block in his beanie with a Mac
I'm what you rap niggas 'fraid of
A Compton nigga that could go bar for bar with Jada
Let me tell you who suck, like banana Now or Laters
Blac Chyna head the bomb, al-Qaeda
Listen, you want beef I'll cater
Game snap on everything he like a fucking wild gator
Silver and black Ghost, nigga that's Al Davis
Give me Left Eye back, take Fetty Wap and the Raiders
The Rams is back, them bullets getting tossed
16 on your back like you fucking Jeff Goff
Your man acting girly too put 30 on his chest
Kanye shrug bitch, welcome to the west
YG, Nipsey, and Kendrick yea check
Shout 'em out I just do it like a fucking Nike rep
Bentley truck Chuck, with the Henny cupped up
Don't get me fucked up, you see the semi tucked, duck
Pass the Goose, where them duck ducks?
These hoes foaming at the mouth, they got Penny fucked up
I'm 'bout to poke 'em like a cactus
Told that bitch to roll the Philly for the game, and she talking about practice
The Maybach is A.I
Artificial intelligence motherfucker that's Junior Seau
All my doors suicide, I'm in Vegas shoot the five
Tell the dealer pay me don't be shy he ain't from Do or Die
Now do you wanna ride, back seat of my Caddy?
Used to flip them pies ain't no relation to Patti
And I move Ps, ain't no relation to Swaggy
Before that it was missing teeth and nickel sack baggies
That's caine, no daddy cause I ain't really have one
And you can't call yourself dope if you ain't never bag none
I'm the old DMX you niggas Drag-On
Game raw as fuck like poking holes in the Magnum
Used to ether the niggas in all of my 16s
Now I scare 'em once a year like I'm fucking Halloween
This ain't a dream, nigga hurricane a nightmare
Stab you in your sleep and smack your baby out his highchair
Your daddy was a bitch, I had to do it
I ain't need no ski mask to do it
Murder is Rihanna and I'm attracted to it
Name a state, I'll send a package through it
If the fed hack into it, they get bossed on like I'm Massachusetts
 
Huh!
Sitting in this Maybach with music
Your head is like Mustard beat and I'll put the ratchet to it
PARTY sent my jackas to it
Drama bring the Mac into it
And this scope will get your mouth washed when I attach it to it
Gold on my neck, I make your bitch put her back into it
Usain Bolt if you bring a real track into it
Another classic moving the way to Aftermath to do it
Dre had the Chronic all I did was put the matches to it
Traffic moving backwards through it
Ever since I had the Buick
Known for putting cheese on niggas heads the way the Packers do it
And I had the yay, yea I brought crack to music
Every situation in rap, I've been a savage through it
And all these hoes getting mad cause I'm smashing through 'em
They can get a ring one day, if the Cavs can do it
Be LeBron bitch, I'm Jayceon bitch
Who else you seen parked at the swap meet in James Bond shit?
Another foreign car driven by a convict
Aventador matte black Akon lips
Nas ether niggas, Game napalm shit
Niggas say my name I pop up like the State Farm bitch
No nigga can see me, on or off TV
Gum bottom Yeezys,
 
I'm the 6' 5"" Eazy
Lightskin bitches be mad and talking greasy
I'ma start fucking them Dej Loafs and Dreezy's
I'ma start beefing with Cole, Drizzy and Cornrow Kenny
Or you could pick your favorite rapper, and he gon' be pouring out Henny
I got a bitch from Minne-Apolis pack a semi
Bang the ratchet at Denny's and fly herself back to Philly
She got a couple mill and she don't even know Meek
And ever since that nigga snitched on me we just don't speak
See that shit you got with Drake is like a slow leak
Blood'll be dripping like Niagara if I poke Meek
Nicki won't get no sleep, I'm coming through at 4 a.m
Four deep, to leave his dead body on the soaked sheets
It could happen lowkey
You better have Ross call me or you gon' be eye level with a roach feet
This ain't a diss, nigga
This is all lives matter except this nigga's

This 1992 shit ain't no new shit
We in that all black you won't know who Blood and who Crip
With guns big enough to sink a fucking cruise ship
Fuck around and be a news clip with them loose lips
My nigga Drizzy packed you out and you ain't do shit
This the Golden State and my shooters ain't on no hoop shit
Nigga, you know that I'll snap you like a toothpick
And snitching on niggas ain't never been no cool shit
And I've been wanting to give Nicki this pool stick
So tell your lil' vivrant thing come fuck with Q-Tip
We know where you live, nigga, you better move quick
And start thinking twice about who you hop in the coupe with",https://genius.com/The-game-92-bars-lyrics

In New York, Quad Studios, gettin' high though
Off that sour diesel and that hydro
This nigga take an L every time he go viral
Welcome to the West, and this ain't The Life of Pablo
Stay on that bullshit it's gon' start to feel like Chicago
Keep it one hunnid, you Nicki Minaj sideshow
Still chasin' dreams, I made ""Dreams"" in '05 though
Ridin' around, 10 Cam Newtons in the Tahoe
And when we touch down everybody catchin' spirals
Dressed in all black like the Panthers
We seen your Sway freestyle, Omelly ain't the answer

You ain't got the answers, man! You ain't got the answers! (Kanye…) You ain't got the answers! You ain't got the answers, Sway! I've been doin' this more than you!
Niggas ain't got the answers for me
You shoulda went and got A.I., left Beans in rehab

Yeah, take Beans back to rehab
On Instagram lookin' like a mothafuckin' bean bag
Flyin' through Philly on them Wocky sticks
Punk-ass nigga, I'll beat you with a hockey stick
The nigga Hov gave you the game, you ain't soak it
You was s'posed to throw up the Roc, not smoke it
Talkin' you gon' be in L.A. in three hours
It's a 5-hour flight, put this bum in the shower
Pussy, I'm not a rookie, akhi, don't push me
Strapped, Ninja Turtles, nigga's runnin' with a rat
Now Tak tell 'em how you coppin' pleas on the jack
Fuck runnin' in the game, you gon' be runnin' into Wack
You jumped Quentin Miller and now you don't scrap
It was time to go at Drizzy and now you don't rap
Ask your bitch, she know I beez in the trap
You gotta move out of L.A., I'll put them Bs on your back
And Barbie keep her thumb in your butt
That Ken doll love gettin' fucked
Hide behind your niggas, you ain't got the guts
Ridin' dirt bikes with your ass on some nuts
Now you can pop a wheelie to that!
I went from B-more to New York to Philly and back
It's a lot of cheese at stake, this nigga really a rat
I fuck with Philly, but this nigga make y'all city look wack
And that's on Piru, yeah, I put the P on that hat
You get hit with the Eagle, roll a Philly to that
Now tell the world how you got your bitch
You FaceTimed Nicki while Safaree was fuckin' a chick
You ain't shit but a rat to me, a snake that don't rattle me
Lil' homie won't scrap with me, time to body his faculty
I'm in traffic, B, bumpin' this old Cassidy
Meesha's another casualty, fuckin' with me's a tragedy
The louder your scream, the wacker the verse
I put that dick chaser logo on the back of your hearse
They say the meek shall inherit the Earth
So I went and dug your ass up, 'cause Drizzy buried you first
And why you tryna pick on Wale?
You told me that you don't fuck with Rozay
And YG can't give you a pass
I add 20 to your 40s, put the 60s on your ass
And don't try to whine to the Grapes
You not the Rams, don't come back to L.A
I fuck around and catch an Uber to Slay
I'm a drama king, and a street sweeper with a K
Nigga, this is 2Pac mixed with the old Guwop
15 years, 30 mil', nigga, who flopped?
One good song, but you ain't got a classic yet
Bought your first album, ain't took it out the plastic yet
Move from Philly to L.A. and think he Fresh Prince
Sean Kingston got robbed and now you niggas best friends
Fat sloppy Twinkie eatin' ass nigga
You ain't got no pass, nigga, I'ma beat your ass, nigga
Jelly bean smugglin' fuck-ass nigga
I'll get some clippers and cut your mama's mustache, nigga
Fuck your sister while you watch 'cause she's kinda thick
And make that bitch take a knee, like Colin Kaepernick
Now back to Squeak Milly, Meeky Mouse
You gon' fuck around, get tied up inside Nicki house
I got esés on Beaumont, posted like Cousins
Waiting for the word to pump it up, like Joe Buddens
Thou shall not fuck with Chuck, pawns are stuck
Fold you up in boxes; Armani tux
Louie sweats, armor tucked
Night night, use that pillow like a silencer, from dawn to dusk
Get at me, you niggas gon' see me in gloves
Or see me in clubs with ""Summer Sixteen"" in the snub
Lying on the Internet like you ain't talking to twelve
Got the cops at my door, like they dropping off mail
I seen that fake paperwork on XXL
Rat niggas chew through walls and leave you in cells
Before you see me in jail, you will see me in hell
You went and got the whole Philly, it's just me by myself
I could have went and got Kendrick, went and got Snoop
Went and got Nipsey, Jay Rock, ScHoolboy Q
Could have went and got E-40, brought Ice Cube back
And have Dr. Dre screaming ""Meek Mill is a rat""
It's a wrap, red khakis, red Cincinnati
I'ma see you in the streets, don't at me
You like a boat with a hole you can't sail
Meek Mill, me and Drake gave you them two Ls

When these rats start snitching, break 'em off!

Pieces on gold leashes
Cruisers, around greases make them cohesive
I'm the sun shining with God features
Draw closer to a true blood bleeder, soul of a southern preacher
Went from dinner with bottom feeders to world leaders
We throw the peace up, knowing that the world need us
Eagerness to live life and see the bright lights
To sacrifices we made it's sorta Christ-like
At the after party thinking what the afterlife's like
He paid for our sins, is it really priced right?
Fuck it, I see the light, broads, they see the light
Can't deny my Jesus piece that’s so Peter-like
Chicks crow for dough, get low for mo'
A convo piece, she end up at the condo
Another Jane Doe or a golden angel
Pendant on an angle, watch the chain glow

On and On
On and On
On and On

Back when Dot was hangin' out at Top's in the Benzo
Freestylin' to them 
Chronic
 instrumentals, no pens and pencils
I was out there Bloodin' like a menstrual
With a Backwood clinched between my dentals, way back when
When we was outside with the indo
Hotboxin' rentals in front of Centennial, remedial thoughts
Never thought that I would amount to shit
Smoke chronic, fuck bitches, ride around bouncin' shit
From Impalas to that Harley truck, to dishraggin' bitches
That was hard to fuck, I came up, it was hardly luck
Just left Compton, and I ain't have to use my AK
What a day, what a day

Back when my driver's license, was baby faced and triflin'
I made my way through crisis, I made my tape
And recorded portraits in front of sirens,
 
I made you hate the vibrant
You can't escape the tyrant, you can't relate where I've been
In '98 my problem, actin' too grown and shit
Cappin' at bitches, yeah my religion through songs and shit
On me, that's on me
Raise up, nigga, you are not the homie
Bitch I’m well-connected from my section down to Long Beach
Fumblin' with Tetris if your block neglectin' your ki
Everyday I wake up with my face up to my father
Makin' sure my heart is pure enough to grow my seed and harvest
All my king is stuffin', double up my plantation with dollar
Every dream is such reality, my déjà vu done caught up
Bitch I'm brought up with the homies, that's on me
24/7, Kendrick revvin' these cold streets
Don't we live by it, die by it, then reincarnate
And if Game told me, ""Drive by it,"" I raise AK
Ain't no shame on it, cry about it, fuck that, I'll play
Like no name on it, blindsided, ain't no one safe
Documentary
 had identities of where I'm from
Therefore my energy had to make sure the better me won
It ain't no better one, son, it ain't no tellin' me nothin'
Nigga that's Chuck, Doc Dre and K, the legacy's done, BLAOW!

Oh man, you thought these niggas with attitude would show gratitude
Fooled you
From 2015 to infinity it's still bomb weed and Hennessy
I can pimp a butterfly for the energy
Game I need acapella

There I go, give me a minute, nigga
'Bout to hit a home run, K. Dot, grab the pennant, nigga
Pin it on my Pendleton,
 
trap late night, Jay Leno them
Got my mom a tennis bracelet, Wimbledon of Wilmington
Now can I rap for a minute? Black on the track for a minute
Look in my rhyme book, see murder like when I was a fan of No Limit
Ain't no gimmicks 'round here, this Compton, me, Doc and Kendrick
Chronic
, 
good kid
, my first year, 3 documentaries
Now I'm blockin' sentries,
 
16 Impalas
They bounce like they Iguodala
That's on my mama, niggas up and did me a solid
I put that on me, that's on me
You get a bullet fuckin' with the lil' homie
Thinkin' back then like fuck your rules, nigga this is Piru
Slide through with the Erykah Badu
West side Compton, nigga don't mind if I do
From Piru Street to my old street
Nigga this Compton, grew up on a dead end
Got an armful of dead friends
Round here Crips be sweatin' us niggas like a headband
Like what's up cuz
(Yo dawg where you from?)
No time to stop and think
Pull your strap before they do or you get shot before you blink
Straight outta Compton, 3 times I told you
The third time I said it with TDE mothafucka
I'll make you eat every letter
Spoonfeed you niggas like toddlers,
 
from the city of Impalas
When shot callers take their pitbulls and feed them niggas rottweilers
My clip full, I quick pull, no more slangin' 8 balls on the corner
And all them niggas I used to freestyle with, I ate y'all on the corner
Call the coroner, niggas dead out here
Hangin' onto life by a thread out here
Them niggas wearin' all that red out here
P snapbacks on niggas heads out here
So don't you come fuckin' with the little homie
So OG they call me Tony
Montana, no French, my red bandana legit
My uncle told me before he died, ""Just keep your hand on the brick""
So I did
Sell every chicken that a nigga had in stock, yes I did
Walked to Compton, hot pocket full of rocks, yes I did
Skipped class, yes I did, whooped niggas ass, yes I did
Fucked a bitch behind the bleachers while on the rag, that's on Bloods
Westside, that's on Bloods, this TEC fly, that's on Bloods
You fuck with Dot, I'll let you choke on your blood
I put that...

On me, that's on me
On me, that's on me
On me, that's on me
Raise up, nigga you are not the homie
On me, that's on me
On me, that's on me
On me, that's on me
Raise up, nigga you are not the homie",https://genius.com/The-game-on-me-lyrics

I, walk on the moon,
 flow hotter than June
Any nigga want drama I kick up a sand dune
Peace to my man Tune for giving his man room
Now we hittin’ switches 'til the Spring Break, Cancun
Get it? Nah forget it, Soo Woo I live it
Made the letter B more famous than a Red Sox fitted
But that was suicide, I don’t live in Judas’ eyes
Half of these rappers weren’t trappin’ when I was choppin’ the do or die
Suge had me in,
 
I went Puffy like Zab Judah eye
Dre called, told my baby momma “won’t you decide”
She chose Doc, first day I pulled dude a side
Like it's Aftermath for life and all I do is ride
Before I turn on ‘em I kill Satan
And stick my red flag in the ground it’s Red Nation

Now Blood the fuck up
Every day’s a gamble muthafucka tough luck
And we gon' fuck the world 'til that bitch bust nuts
I can’t tell you what's good, but I can tell you what's what
And that’s, B’s up, hoes down
Lookin’ in the mirror, I’m nowhere to be found
Blood, I’m a dog, call me a blood hound
Throwin’ blood in the air, leave blood on the ground

Live and die for this shit, word to 2Pac Shakur’s halo
One blood,
 
plural, nigga I’m spending Euros
Ferrari got an ice cream paint job, Dorrough
I’m up out the hood, where they pull guns on you like
Come up out ya hood, it ain't never all good
We roll up in backwoods, 
nigga get to actin’ stupid
Get thrown in the backwoods, Los Angeles
Home of the scandalous,
 pimp, hoes and gamblers
98 degrees on Christmas,
 
nigga we rollin’ cannabis
Swisha sweet ain't it, 
I told her I’m Charles Louboutin
The bitch fainted, pulled her panties down, stain it
That’s my Chi-lingo, yeah I’m bi-lingual
Ball by myself, nigga, Ochocinco
Dancing with the stars,
 
bullets and fast cars
And everybody bleed out here, word to God

Last train to Paris, round the world in these red Nikes
Che Guevara

Louisville slugger, Yogi Berra in my new era
Got that natty on, tighter than a magnum
Walk in the club saggin’ with a .38 Magnum
Red Ralph Laurens, 
the double R sittin’
On a hill like Lauren
 her and the car foreign
Got my red Dre Beats on, tryna put my peeps on
And I keep it hood like this Phantom is a Nissan
Where my nigga Jim Jones at?
 Roll up the weed son
So many bloods in Compton had to get a NYC song
And while I’m out here, I might as well go shopping
And put this new bad bitch I got in some red bottoms
And all these hatin’ ass niggas want me dead
Cause I’m Malcolm X before he turned Muslim, Red

Now Blood the fuck up

Just Another Day,Compton,2015.0,"It's motherfuckin' Game time!

Six pounds of chronic on my grandma coffee table
That's how you remember it? That's how I remember it
Yeah, dip into the liquor store, nine in my khakis
Crips tryna get at me, my red Impala bumping like acne
My city a trap me; been shot, robbed, stabbed, chased home, socked out
Jabbed by esse's, cops, degenerate niggas with rags
Disintegrate niggas when enemy, dome shots like Kennedy
Slugs drippin' with Hennessey, got murderous tendencies
And if you don't know where the fuck they got me from
Martin Scorsese when I pull out my gun
Scarface, car chase, tell me how your blood taste
Ask your baby mama, she'll tell you how a Blood taste
Basket case, still I'm back with Dre, wait I never left
Run up in Beats, ""Bitch pass the safe! Compton""
Produced by a billion in this motherfucker
Still smokin', Dre we need a ceilin' in this motherfucker
Compton! They killin' in this motherfucker
They grillin' in this motherfucker
Lock the door, they stealin' in this motherfucker
No chains, no rings, this my home
Nigga, this Hub City, no-fly zone
Niggas pull out burners
Start breakin' like Turbo on Ozone
Crack fiends on the back streets
Where the tracks lean, where the needles lay
And switchblades, if you bitch made
Put chili all on your Frito Lay's
Where we dream of Montego Bay
But all we got is the swap meet
Where the cops meet, go bang bang
Leaves blood stains on that concrete
And I'm the only nigga bumpin' Mobb Deep
'Cause I mob deep down that side street
'Cause I'm a West side rider, live with gats on collars
Don't hate me, better get your dollars
I be on Rosecrans with a Glock in both hands
Leanin' on that Brougham
Flamed up like a Coke can with my name on it

Another day in Compton, the thrill is high
Know somebody's watchin', but I don't know why
Feel the fire burnin', it touches the sky
Feel 'em coming at you, I won't die tonight
So I get by, I get by
I get by, I get, I get by

Good Girls Go Bad,The R.E.D. Album,2011.0,"Since Big ain't here, I'm about to do it for T'yanna
And put roses on the grave of Kanye's mama
This for all the lost girls locked up in the pen
All the girls that hold it down, getting beat on by they man
Respect women, I don't care if they a 2 or a 10
We don't beat on Kat Stacks, we just bring it to an end
And we don't wanna see Nicki fighting Lil Kim
There’s missing women out there, let’s just focus on them
This song is dedicated to Natalee Holloway
I feel for her daddy so I wrote this on father's day
I know she gone, but she ain't far away
I just had a daughter
, pass me that cigar 'Ye
I'm 'bout to tell a story, everybody parlay
Sit back listen while I kick it, the Compton Boulevard way
My daddy used to beat up on my mama all day
So I took my Chronic album and slept in the hallway
I learned this the hard way, when police came our way
My daddy had his act on like it never happened (Broadway)
Plus I was kinda scared to keep it real with you
Now my mama good, nigga she ain't gotta deal with ya
You want some money nigga? I ain't get a deal with ya
You ain't saying nothing, you like a still picture
You better thank God you still breathing air
Cause you coulda went out like your boy Steve McNair

Don't make the good girls go bad, no
Don't make the good girls go bad, no (I won't)
If you don't, you gon’ really love us  (I said I won't)
Please don’t use us, dooon’t

Good evening, I'm in Chicago at the Elysian
With some girls that say they models but umm, I don't believe 'em
Who's still getting tested?
Where's all the women that still remember who they slept with?
Where's all the girls too busy studying to make the guest list
But when you do go out, you still working what you was blessed with?
Do it girl, I'll be the king to your Queen Latifah
I love your ass like Milhouse loved Lisa
I love your ass like the Ninja Turtles love pizza
Ironically enough, you something I want a piece of, you got it girl
This song remind me of Cat from Philly, a girl I used to love
Until she started acting silly, her heart's a little chilly
She a little too carefree in 10 years
Who's paying for all that therapy? Umm, nigga not me, yeah
I'm probably not the man you take me for
But I bet I could be if you make me yours
Most of the shit I say is true
When I’m done with bad bitches, know I’m coming straight to you good girl

Don't make the good girls go bad, no
Don't make the good girls go bad, no
If you don't, you gon’ really love us
Please don’t use us, noo

Drizzy, I'm sitting here watching 
Basketball Wives
Like, ""uhh, them is basketball wives?""
Only cute one, Gloria, that's my nigga Matt Barnes' chick
Can't swim in that poon fool, that's a crucial conflict
Never sleep with the wife of niggas you eat with
And never buy a chick a bag on the first date
I pop a bottle with her on her birthday and tell her ass ""get on!""
Disrespect my chick, that type of shit'll get you spit on
I don't hit on girls, I just hit on girls
Like ""hey lil mama, come in Game and Drizzy's world""
Get busy girl, drink that rosé 'til you're dizzy girl
She walking around the club all lost, like where is he girl?
He on the top of the charts, next to Beyonce
Right under Kanye, so let the Don spray
That’s your girl? Nigga go on and make her cry
Soon as you do, I'm pulling up in that Porsche like ""
let's ride
""

Don't make the good girls go bad, no
Don't make the good girls go bad, no
If you don't make the good girls go bad, no
Don’t make the good girls go bad, no
If you don't, you gon’ really love us
Please don’t use us, nooo

Word on the news stand, Alicia got herself a man
And thats my nigga Swizzy,

Picture that, like Meagan Good and Jamie Foxx
Hype said it's a wrap, she still on the set
Puttin' oil on her legs like she Gloria Velez
She was Eye Candy in the XXL
Hopped off the page and on a skateboard with Pharrell
I knew she wouldn't get far cause five hundred dollars
Can't get you that far, how you get that far
And all these new video bitches tryin to be Melyssa Ford

She do whatever it take to get to the Grammy Awards, ha ha

Maybe get chose by a nigga from my team

Would you be with Jay-Z if he wasn't C-E-O
Would you be with F-A-B-O if he drove a Neo
Would you ride with Ne-Yo,

In Miami Beach when Lil' Kim was fuckin with Scott
I got the scoop on Hoops, whatever the case
She'll let you spray in her face long as she Bathing Apes

On that superhero shit
Fly as Gabrielle Union
 
in the back of my six, fo'

Aftermath been here, the beats been knocking
Nate Dogg doing his thing, DPG still popping

Got shot, came back, jumped on Dre's back

And I don't do button-up shirts or drive Maybachs

Rap critics wanna converse about this and that
'Cause red strings in his Converse, and this a Dre track
Keep jibbing and jabbing, I pull the .38 Magnum
Magnum and get to clickin' and clacking
Your homies wanna know what happened
Come to Compton, see Thriller like Mike Jackson
I might be Spike Lee of this gun clappin'
Prior to rapping, I was drug trafficking
In the dope spot, playing John Madden

You wanna die? Run up on that black 7-45

Got me fucking with G-Unit, you know the drama that bring
I got niggas in Westside Compton and Southside Queens

So I ain't gotta tuck in my chain like DJ Pooh
I'm gangsta—more like Deebo when he was Zeus
Play Bishop, I paint that picture, now, who got the juice?
You niggas is Nutso, I'll take off your roof
Leave your ass stretched out like a Cadillac coupe
God gotta let me in Heaven, all the shit I've been through
I was a O.G. in the hood before I turned twenty-two
Homie, I let the .38 special rip through that vest
And I don't contemplate whether not he left his shit on the dresser
Got Compton on my back, I'm starting to feel the pressure
I'm lyrically Kool G. Rap on these Dre records

Wit ya, noooo, I ain't mad at ya
Get out of line, probably throw a couple jabs at em

Hit Rodeo, probably throw a couple bags at ya
In my 2Pac voice - I ain't mad at ya
Take the wheel, see if you can drive while I eat it
My fitted flew off, but I don't need it, tell me what I need

You need a bitch that's gonna blast, spend cash with ya
Same time fuck good, drop ass for you
Yeah, I ride it like rah-rah-rah-rah
Eat the pussy like la-la-laaaa

Why you gotta tell a nigga bid'ness?
Fine nigga Friday, you know a nigga live this
Hit you with the helicopter tongue
Then fuck you til the helicopter come

My ambitionz of a rida-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
My ambitionz of a rida-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
My ambitionz of a rida

One look and I got her
Hittin' corners in my Impala

Slidin down that pole for a dollar, nada
Tell that girl holla (my ambitionz of a rida)
I done brought the thug life out her
Got her stuffin bricks in that Prada (my ambitionz of a rida)
And she love when I'm inside her
And can't nobody divide us

Bought a Audemar, we don't google, we buy the stock, nigga
Same old boppers, leader of the new school
Spraying on them lockers, no rain gon' stop us
Put the swang on yoppers, flush on the bottom
Gold fangs on the top ones, Lucc game with the chopper
And I'm known for cutting these hoes like I'm the bachelor
They stuck in the hood, I'm the spatula
Told these bitches, expose these bitches for who they are
You a thot, yeah I really know these bitches

The piggidy-piggidy face of a riggidy clown
Black out, back out like a flimsy blouse
Fuck a track out, like racing outside, pussies chalked outline
Niggas can't be outshined, out rhymed or out dimes
I'm like Magic in his prime without HIV
(Come on) It's stunting season
It's fuck niggas like gays but for the other reason
Me and Lucky getting cuddy in them other reasons
Period, the bitch bleed then I fucking bleed 'em
(What?) You fucking with a thot, nigga!
My Compton niggas come with K's like dot, nigga
Real when I talk, you can tell by my tone
A few instagram likes, the bitch swear that she on!

She like the way I dress with them 501s on the chill
On our first two visits, nasty when I fuck her
Told her keep me out the clinic, on mamas I'm 'bout that business
Blowing money fast but I'm standing out them fences
Super pervert, I'm G. Levert to these bitches
Feeling like that nigga, back when I was skinny
Before I was filling out them pictures and fucking with your sister
Mr grab diamond ware share of hoes
And if my bitch didn't have a kid, I'd have a layer for hoes
Hella sick with this pimping, my mama taught me how to tell a chick from a chicken
Don't be fucking with a Christian
Diamond Lane banging, ain't hear it then get the trippin'

300 Bars & Runnin’,"You Know What It Is, Vol. 3",2005.0,"My mom took me to Sam Goody
I wanted to buy a 50 Cent CD
I took that shit home
That shit was wack like a motherfucker
I fuck with Game

I like 50 Cent
He reminds me SpongeBob
And Tony Yayo is Blue's Clues
And Lloyd Banks is Dora the Explorer
They're my friends
Psyche

I went down one of them bodega shits right there in Harlem
Got me a bootleg Lloyd Banks and Young Buck CD
Took that shit home, put it in my boombox
Thought I was 'bout to be on some Radio Raheem shit
Man that shit sound like some Vanessa Williams in '88
I mean Olivia cute but they say that bitch a man
So this Black Wall Street for life now
G-G-G-Unot!

300 Bars and Runnin'
Just loan me your ears for fifteen minutes
Walk with me
Here the breakdown
Pass the doja, .45 in the holster
Hollow tips'll fold 'em, them niggas, they toy soldiers
Oh, that boy colder than Hova unless he sober
Like I'm the president, but this ain't the Takeover
Now, there's the speaker, bring your ears a little closer
Before you call this a diss, and you make Hova pissed
Why would I wanna do that? When I'm just the new cat
That was taught if a nigga take shots to shoot back
Defending his yard, yeah, standing his ground
I'm saying if you gonna retire, then hand me the crown
Nah, let Bleek do it, then throw him a concert in Madison Square
Watch everybody sleep through it
We can go bar for bar, I'll let the lines speak to 'em
What they say? Bleek is over, let Chris and Neef do it
They say the wrong thing, I'ma smack 'em silly
What you thought? Them was the only niggas rapped in Philly?
See them niggas with the sunnis leave you wrapped in Philly
Then dash in groups like Beanie Mac in Philly
Cosmic Kev called, said Curtis Jack in Philly
Make a U-turn, I gotta go back to Philly
I forgot my cheesesteak, that's what I told the cops
So they wouldn't get the dogs start searching for the Glock
And I can't forget, B.I.G. got murdered by the cops
Even I was ready to die, when I heard that he was shot
What's beef? Beef is when I murk you on the spot
Labels signing anything, still searching for they Pac
I put purple on the block, so I don't feel threatened
When Ludacris say he coming for the number one spot
Ask 50, it get lonely on top, you can hate me
Or love me, but now the cops the only homies he got
When it's beef we eat, when we hear bologna, we pop
You sell records but a G-G-G-U-not
Acting big on the radio, to me you not
You can ask Mister Cee who hot
Tony Yayo, I bet 10 G's you flop
Run up on that new 300C you got
Stop hoping I fall, hope the bleeding stop
And I hope you blackout before you see the cops
I ain't High Top from Colors, I'm from Cedar Block
But what I got in my high tops'll make your breathing stop
I'm a gangsta slash rapper, check your CD shop
I'm like Elvis in there, they can't believe he dropped
Now I'm moving on up to George and Weezy's spot
I picked up where my homeboy Eazy stopped
I saw the west coast, put the shit on my back
Sprayed Aftermath on it, then loosened the straps
It get hot in here, let Lucifer rap
Bring hell to niggas when Dre producing a track
Take it to the streets, put the duece-duece to your hat
Then call the pigs, tell them the rooster is back
Call Jadakiss, tell him that duke is back
I'm still by your side, no matter who comes strapped
Fuck Lloyd Banks, it ain't about who could rap
It's about when the Ruger clap, is rufus back?
I see what you thinkin', you want me to die, is that so?
Now you left leaning back thanks to Fat Joe
We got reservations in heaven, you ready? Let's go
Drop them off, then pop Cristal with Esco
I'ma say he hit me first if me and Dre talk
All Nas said back was he had a braveheart
Now that's the eulogy, beefing is kinda foolish
See niggas running their mouth about what the fuck they gon' do to me
But quit the yapping before I proceed to clapping
And you gon' see the captain with plans of getting me captured
Even behind bars, I'm still gon' shine
I'm ten years younger than Yayo, I get out, I'm fine
Then I go right back, nigga, I pop minds
How you gon' drop Olivia? You only drop dimes
I knew you changed when you started sleeping in that vest, dawg
I don't need 50 Cent, my niggas make collect calls
1-800-split a faggot nigga wig
He got G-Unit wings, throw 'em off the Queens Bridge
Now your career is over-career is over
We in Q.B., banging C.N.N. in the rover
T-O-N-Y, that's Capone n' NORE
You ain't the talk of New York, your sixteens is boring
Take that shit off nigga, go back to PC
And tell 50 Cent to send you a copy of Beef 3
I'm airing their ass out on D-V-D
You wanna rhyme like Lloyd Banks, repeat after me
""I'm a G-Unit toy soldier on Sesame Street
Doing voice overs,"" bitch ass nigga
Need a rhyme dictionary to rehearse his lines
Sound like Oscar the Grouch with them nursery rhymes
We was in the studio when I first got signed
He got stuck, he called 50, tried to borrow some lines
That's the wrong nigga, when you need help with your rhyme
All he gon' tell you is say G-Unit one more time
Got mad 'cause I ain't wanna make your beef mine
You got lucky with Ja, why you ain't go at Shyne?
He freestyled from the pen, that's just the fact
Said he'd put you with your mom and you ain't fucked with that
Then you lied about your pops, he never bust no cap
Like father, like son, go ask Busta that
I knew from the beginning not to trust those cats
I'd kill 'em all if I could bring Justo back
The underground is mine, I treat it like home
It's the reason niggas saying my name like Mike Jones
The underground is mine, I treat it like home
It's the reason niggas saying my name like Mike Jones
The underground is mine, I treat it like home
It's the reason niggas saying my name like Mike Jones
I said
The underground is mine, I treat it like home
It's the reason niggas saying my name like Mike Jones
And I'm far from Houston but you can chop it and screw it
Do whatever to it, put it in the store, the shit moving
Gave 'em a hundred bars, they ain't think I could do it
Came with two hundred, nigga this is more than music
Even Dre knew it, that boy hot like summer
Both feet in the dirt, 300 Bars and Runnin'
I beef with any nigga, say my name, motherfucka, I'm gunnin'
You can put it on Skee if you want it
I'll air you out on Drama King, Mike, or Clue
And watch them shits sell out like a Air Jordan shoe
I told Funk Flex when I catch the nigga Whoo Kid
We gon' see if he know how to DJ with bruised ribs
Don't hit me on the Sidekick asking what you did
Get a gun or ask 50's police to use his
'Cause Bloods gonna get ya
Blood-Blood-Bloods gonna get ya for that Shadyville chain
That 380 spill brains, when I pop shots
Outside N.Y., in front of hip-hop cops
Or broad day in L.A., I'ma tell Em and Dre
This nigga bootlegging my music, ain't nothing for him to say
Took me off my own songs, then put it on his tapes
So I'ma take him out his house, put the beam on his face
Drop him off at Terror Squad, let him scream for the jakes
'Cause when you fucking with Jayceon, you can bleed in the lake
For caking off niggas on them CD's and tapes
Ask him to scratch a record, you will see that he is fake
If 50 was Puffy, you'd run and go get him a cheesecake
Take the DJ off your name, Mr. Instant Replay
Now the instant replay, I mean the machine
That G-Unit use every time 50 on stage singing like
""Bitches only feel your shit just a lil' bit
Niggas only feel your shit just a lil' bit""
On my album, 50 helped me just a lil' bit
Only on two songs, now back to some killer shit
My clips bananas, I kill a gorilla quick
Beating on your chest, I see to your death, yep
Tell Ecko to make him a suit
Tell Reebok to make him some boots, get him a head band
To cover the holes in his head, he a dead man
For thinking he can walk through muddy waters like Redman
Banks blacked out and let the gun blam
Without a M-E-T-H-O-D Man
So the lieutenant gotta ask for his strings
Take my advice, never wear Air Max to the bing
Unless you one of the Bloods or a Latin King
'Cause if you left with the Aryans your ass'll sting
And your cellmate is a 25 to lifer
They'll stab you in Folsom, then fuck you on Rikers
And life goes on
Now back to the coward of the hour, who lied and said he write my songs
He told Vibe Dre was gonna leave me on the shelf
So he gave me all his hits, you should've kept them for yourself
Nigga stop acting tough before I stand over you
Show you how The Documentary live on top of The Massacre
Make a move, I'm blasting, add those to the last ones
Ten shots from the MAC, empty the rest in the passenger
Fase yelling that's enough, let the coroner bag him up
Throw in Makaveli and lift the doors on the Maganum
Gun smoking, Fase think I'm locin' backing up
Reverse the '05 hearse on 41st and traffic, what
Hip-hop cops on my left, but I pass 'em up
The Dodge got a Hemi in it, Game got Remy in 'em
In and out of lanes like a New York cab
I miss the old king that New York had
Who's this fake nigga on pictures with the Jake nigga?
Got his crew starving 'cause he ate the whole cake, nigga
He ain't Nas, ain't B.I.G., ain't Jigga
If he ain't Cube or Pac then who you got?
We getting tired of you talkin about who you shot
I'll use another six bars to tell you who you not
You ain't 50 Cent, he went out like a gangsta
You went out with Vivica, three months after Wanksta
Get Rich or Die Tryin, we thought you was hot
Now the same nigga wanna take us to the Candy Shop
C'mon man, what happened to the thug?
Now you could find in the club, him and Lloyd Banks hugging
Nigga got mad when The Game start buzzing
So fuck making friends now I'm into throwing slugs
Olivia talking about we a family, Game had to go
Nigga, I'll smack that hoe like I'm Jackie-O
'Cause I don't wanna be cool, I don't wanna be you
I don't wanna shake hands or wear your G-Unit shoes
Don't want you on my hooks, don't wanna be in your group
Just wanna sit here and wait (for the summer)
To be gone, so I can head back to the block
Fresh white Nike Airs and the matching Sox fitted
Pull the brim low, if they don't get it
Bentley Coup on gold Daytons, I was the first one with it
Four times platinum, I done been there and did it
Came in the game and shitted, then wiped my ass with it
They say the Lord giveth, Lord take it away
So I build a house on top of Hip-Hop, I'll wait for the day
Niggas hating on me, they don't want Jayceon to play
And the D.A. waiting on Jayceon to make a mistake
So they can put me in the squad car and lock me away
Give me a odd job in the pen for minimal pay
Let me out so I can drive down criminal way
Pushing the rock, nah, this ain't no subliminal, Jay
The summer too hot and I just want the winter to stay
'Cause I'm a cold nigga when I put the pen to the page
Similar to them shells going into my gauge
I hand 'em off to Dre, he turned them into grenades
And Just Blaze, 'cause the boy got game
Like I close my eyes, and woke up in a Roc chain
Now back to reality, my gun and my vest
And if diamonds are forever, then I'm Kanye West
Take a look at my chest, a hundred thou wet Jacob
Whole crew got chains, a hundred thou can't break 'em
And the flow is hot like thou with Satan
And the only thing I got spinning is Daytons
The hotter I get, the more willing to snake 'em
So soon as the beat drop, watch where I take 'em
Compton swap meet to get me some All-Stars
When Game in the house, they callin' all cars
'Cause they heard about what went on in D.C
Heard about Hot 97, my beef with 50
Now tell me do he got a conscience?
I think not, 'cause if he did I wouldn't be involved in his nonsense
Wouldn't be in Harlem, wouldn't be at this conference
I'd rather be pushing rock like Samantha Ronson
50 whispered in my ear, like we still bonding
We ain't friends, I'm just acting like Charles Bronson
Middle finger in the air, one hand on my Johnson
Hip-Hop police on me like I'm the convict
What happened to the old school? I thought it was rhyming
Doug E. Fresh and Dana Dane on the corner like Common
Now that ain't common, it's more like Top Ramen
The flow is noodles, I throw it up like vomit
And I still shine like diamonds, they kicked me out of
G-Unit and I rebounded like Rodman
It's still Aftermath, two feet in the paint
Should I be mad? I ain't
I'm supposed to stop, I can't
Because I'm in the hood politicking, Impala liftin'
And I keep a black four-five on the side of my Prada denim
Chip on my shoulder like I'm fresh outta prison
Dollar vision, blow a hundred thou like my wallet missing
Then re-up like Kim before the d-cup
Continuously getting money with my feet up
Chasing the throne, here my black Air Force
I said fuck Benzino and got the cover of The Source
Feel me? If not then I guess you gotta kill me
But you ain't gon' do that, so, motherfucker, move back
While I do B.I.G. and Pac impersonations on two tracks
When I wake the dead, everybody remove hats
We miss y'all, can I get a hand clap?
Now back to rap and why I gotta stay strapped?
On that murder T-I-P, kill you ASAP
They don't know which hole to patch up when the K clap
I tried to spare you Young Buck, now it's time for payback
It go, how you from Cashville but you ain't got no cash, nigga?
Say my name, now that's your fucking ass, nigga
Kept your mouth shut and I gave you a pass, nigga
Now I gotta lay you down like the last nigga
Buck, buck, buck from my AK-47
This nigga playing with his life, I might have to put him in Heaven
Tryna play the game, talking shit up on the stereo
Prepare for burials when I'm reincarnating Harry-O
And you don't want that David 'cause you love your life
Get my Vibe? When it's war, he pull out butter knifes
Muthafucker, I'ma show you who the gangsta
All you do is Murder Inc., now who the wanksta?
When Suge had you, you were stranded on the row
Juve left you for dead and went back to the N.O
50 heard you on the tour bus and felt your little flow
Then he made you temporary replacement for Yayo
You a bitch and that's hard to swallow
And you got robbed for your spinning G-Unit chain in Chicago
I call my nigga Jojo to get it back
He had the shit in his hands and you ain't had the ten stacks
Picture that, I thought we was G-Unit
Then you ran and told 50 that I did the shit
Ask C-Murder, the boy ain't hard to find
I told Monica when I catch him, the boy is mine
Take one shot of Brandy and pop
Watch his panties drop when I run inside the Candy Shop
Fuck you, 50, Banks, Yayo, and the cops
And Olivia, I mean for a man, she hot
Now I'm running out of breath, like I just beatboxed
Got twenty bars to go, lay it down like sheet rock
Don't worry about the flow, the boy know he hot
Hurricanes in store November, nigga, fuck Reeboks
I'm fly like a hummingbird on a tree top
The new Hov, the new B.I.G., the new Pac, I need three spots
280 in, ain't no getting me back
I'm yelling, ""Fuck the world,"" on my victory lap
Remember first it was Buddens, then it was Bleek
Now it's whoever, motherfucker, yeah, who want beef?
Now whenever, motherfucker, who wanna see me?
In the coffin, body exhausted, resting in peace
You don't want war, nigga, you want peace
So give 'em the piece, capisce, let 'em rest in peace
From West to East, the flow is outdatable, irreplaceable
Lyrical homicide, hell is hot, I'm boxing with Satan
And I slipped 'em the ace, so you cannot replace 'em
If Eazy ever decide to return, I remain Jayceon
A king in the making and the throne is for the taking
So I climb the mountain top and put my stake in
Got the weight of the world on my shoulder
Not a nigga, nor a hoodrat bitch can stop me from taking it over
This is crack music, go get the baking soda
300 Bars and Runnin', nigga, the wait is over
I'm gone",https://genius.com/The-game-300-bars-and-runnin-lyrics
Start From Scratch,The Documentary,2005.0,"Aight, the fuck are you lookin at, self?
You wanna piece of me?
Ohh man, shit
The story of my life

If I could start from scratch, I wouldn't change shit
Same red bandana, same four-fifth
Same G-wagon, same hoodrat bitch
Workers in the kitchen cookin' up my shit
Same telephone booth, same connect
That mean the same hollow tips breakin' up in my chest
Same bloody t-shirt, same address
Same Dogg Food album banging in my tape deck
Homie, if I can make '94 today
I'd tell Eazy and Dre to bring back N.W.A
I would've told 'Pac not to stomp out Orlando
Told Puffy and Big about the Rampart scandal
I got too many dead homies, fuck a rap career
I'd give anything in the world to bring back my nigga Tear
Seem like we was just in Magic City yesterday
If I could bring back my homeboy Charles, he would say

If I could start my life from scratch
If I could take away the pain of the past
If I had another chance, I would do just that
I'd give anything just to go right back

Homey if I could rewind the hands of time
I would've cut off the PS2 at 12:49
Nigga I'm a gangster, I stay on my grind
Who knew 11 minutes later I'd get shot with my own 9
I was two beeps away from a flatline
When you a Bad Boy niggas don't wanna see you Shyne
Dre said it's my turn, he call it Game time
23 inch Lexani's, bitches call 'em LeBrons
I'd give my own life if I could change God's mind
Bring Baby Loony back at the drop of a dime
He let off a whole 'K, got shot one time
That was a cool nigga, I wish he had nine lives
My brother Jevon died cause he chased the cat
It's a dog eat dog world, Jesus please holler back
I got a confession to make, it's called payback
If you don't wanna listen, show me where Pastor Ma$e at

If I could start my life from scratch
If I could take away the pain of the past
If I had another chance, I would do just that
I'd give anything just to go right back

I would've told Big Will they raid every Tuesday and Thursday
When pigeons in your coupe, you gotta watch where your birds lay
Would've told V to stay sober
When niggas beg for mercy, that mean the beef is over
Told Meeks take the Porsche back, drive the Rover
Told Slim hit reverse on that hardtop Nova
I would've changed a couple of lines when I wrote ""Soldier""
So I wouldn't have to live lookin' over my shoulder
My life is like a Impala, ridin' three-wheel motion
I been front to back, side to side
Level my six-four frame out, keep on rollin'
Keep your family far away and your enemies closer
Picture this, The Source sucking Benzino's dick
Tryin' to be the big fish in the pond, you know how them piranhas get
You dead when that green line go flat
If you could start your life from scratch, you couldn't change that

If I could start my life from scratch
If I could take away the pain of the past
If I had another chance, I would do just that
I'd give anything just to go right back",https://genius.com/The-game-start-from-scratch-lyrics
Don’t Shoot,UnKnown,2014.0,"Our Lord, grant us good in this world
And good in the life, to come keep us safe from the torment of the fire
As we keep our hands up high and scream for justice
Ferguson, rest in peace Mike Brown
And all the young soldiers out there
God help us

Time to take a stand and save our future
Like we all got shot, we all got shot
Throwing up our hands don't let them shoot us
'Cause we all we got, we all we got
God ain't put us on the Earth to get murdered, it's murder
God ain't put us on the Earth to get murdered, it's murder
Don't point your weapons at me

Seen the pictures, feel the pain, scandalous how they murder son
Tired of them killing us, I'm on my way to Ferguson
Talked to TIP, I talked to Diddy, them my brothers walking with me
Mothers crying ""Stop the riots"", we ain't got to chalk the city
I seen Cole out there, felt I should go out there
They left that boy for hours in the cold out there
They killin' teens, they killin' dreams (
It's murder
)

Yo, come on we gotta stick together, we all we got
Police taking shots and I ain't talkin' 'bout Ciroc
I'm talking 'bout Emmett Till
, 
I'm talking 'bout Ezell Ford
I'm talking 'bout Sean Bell, they never go to jail for
Trayvon over Skittles, Mike Brown Cigarillos
History keeps repeating itself, like a Biggie instrumental
America's a glass house and my revenge is mental
Rather use my brain than throw a cocktail through a window

I got the keys to the city still we left in the cold
Hands in the sky, still was left in the road
Ribbon in the sky, Michael Brown, another soul
Stole by the system, black men we pay the toll
The price is your life, Uncle Sam want a slice
Black dress code now we looting in the night
Now we throwing Molotovs in this holocaust
And I know they hate to hear me screaming, ""I'm a Boss!""

Time to take a stand and save our future (

Like we all got shot, we all got shot
Throwing up our hands don't let them shoot us
'Cause we all we got, we all we got
God ain't put us on the Earth to get murdered, it's murder
God ain't put us on the Earth to get murdered, it's murder
Don't point your weapons at me

Tired of the okie-dokie, lying you Pinocchio
Driving while black, tell me, where am I supposed to go?
Gun shots hit the car, now I got the holy ghost
If excessive force was a drug, then they overdosed
Got us tryna protest, it's a slow process
Heard it's a lotta rotten eggs in the crow's nest
People praying on they feet, police holding on they heat
Turned on the news and seen a tank rolling down the street

Yeah, I seen a lot of ice water tossed and I know it's for a cause
My only question is, what we doing for the loss
Of Mike Brown?
'Cause right now, I challenge you to use your talents to
Speak up, and don't you ever let 'em silence you
'Cause action speaks louder than words, that's what I heard
Shot down with his hands up, that's what occurred
Man that sound absurd
Matter fact to me that sound like murder
We want justice

Ayy yo Game, I had a crib out there
I used to live out there
So I know how niggas feel out there
People stressing, protesting, unity is a blessing
So it's time we come together
Use our voice as a weapon
I am Michael Brown, 'cause I stand for what he stand for
News say we're looting
Paint pictures like we some animals
On my NWA CMG
Hollerin' ""Rest in peace Eazy and fuck the police""

Heard another brother slain up in St. Louis
Sure the mother feel the pain, but what you famous doing
I’m sure the general population trying to be more active
But when the light finally catches you, you're ice challenged
Okay, and I support the ALS just like the rest of them
But you have yet to pay your debt
So you just flexing then
'Cause everybody care for a minute, then stop
People only there for a minute, then stop
And what's the point of giving if you ain't giving your all
We never getting ahead, might as well give up your heart
[Bridge: TGT & 
Swizz Beatz
]
Where does it end?
I got my hands up, what else am I supposed to do?
Rest in peace to Mike Brown
Where does it end?
And all the other fallen soldiers
Tell me, where's the love for everything we're going through?
That will not be on the news or televised, ah
Mercy, mercy, mercy, mercy me
Hope that God can save us
Mercy, mercy, mercy, mercy me
As we lead in peace

Martin Luther King had a dream
But they ain't respecting Jesse up out here
And they don't really respect Obama out here
Lights out, go dark - it's like a nightmare
How the fuck you play the game, but they ain't playing fair
It's going down, Armageddon right here
Right now, not on TV but right here
Put your flags in the air if you don't really care (Wave it)
We need justice yeah, we need justice here

I heard he surrendered but we all saw how they did him
Television broadcasts, a confused country
I'm a resident of a nation that don't want me
What's done is done
 
the town erupts in fury
And I'm already hearing 'bout this lopsided jury
Three faces like his, the rest another story
A lot of motherfuckers need to act more worried

The revolution has been televised
If I sit here and do don't do nothing, homie, that's genocide
Fuck that, we have arrived
And who cares who ain't on our side 'cause we on our own
How do you preach peace to a family that just lost they own?
My brodie Game just banged my line like ""We gotta do something""
All that marching and that peace ain't gonna fucking do nothing
Fuck it, my moms, sorry I'm ready to rage
The police done let the animals out of the cage
Oh lord it's

Time to take a stand and save our future
Like we all got shot, we all got shot
Throwing up our hands don't let them shoot us
'Cause we all we got, we all we got
God ain't put us on the Earth to get murdered, it's murder
God ain't put us on the Earth to get murdered, it's murder
Don't point your weapons at me

Young General these niggas gotta spray for
You fuck around and catch 20 out this Range Ro'
Mane that beef shit is what a nigga made for
I open fire on her open mouth, case closed
Came in this bitch with Chuck Taylor's screaming fuck haters
Bad bitch I'ma fuck later, tryna touch paper
In a 6 tre rag going brazy up the ave
What I'm drinking got me thinking, nigga maybe I should iron out my -

To my dope then kicked in locked up in a strange land
So when they be like, ""Slick, why we ain't see you on TV or nothin'?""
Shit, I'm still tryin' get off the gang injunction
Cause when it come to this been, I'm a monster to your leaf
You can do a whole damu documentary on just me

Big homie gave me a gun and said ""It better be empty""
I was 11 years old with a motha'fuckin' 50
I got love for certain niggas, I've been doing this since knee high
And you ain't a real blood if you didn't bang at the beehive

Westside A-Hat, back in a straight jacket
Mister LA back, free my A track
Middle of July, I'm just tryin' bring a Maybach
Whole city riding, I ain't even did a Dre track
Nigga this Athens, Miller gang mad
So east coast niggas be like ""Cuh, you crackin'.""
Niggas ain't goin' hard, as you should stop rappin'

Dre, I see dead people
Modern vampires of the city
Hunting blood

Yo, Dre
Thought I was dead
West Coast
(One blood, one blood, one blood, one blood)

I'm the Doctor's Advocate, nigga, Dre shot ya
Brought me back from the dead
That's why they call him the doctor
The 'Math gon' drop him
And 50 ain't rocking with him no more
It's okay! I get it popping
Whole club rocking, like a six-four Impala
Drink Cris', throw it up, call the shit hydraulics
Then piss in the cup, call the shit Hpnotiq (
Brrrrat!
)
I bleed Compton, spit crack and shit chronic
And you new niggas ain't shit but new niggas
Bathing Ape-shoe niggas, I'm talking to you, niggas
Bouncing in the '64, throwing up West side, man
Sell another 5 million albums? Yes, I am
Fresh like ""Damn, this nigga did it again
A hundred thousand on his neck, L.A. above the brim""
Inside the Lambo shotgun with Snoop
What would the muthafuckin' West Coast be
Without one crip and

One blood

One blood
One blood
Blood, blood, blood, blood-blood-blood
Blood, blood, blood, blood-blood-blood
Blood, blood, blood, blood-blood-blood
One blood, one blood, one blood, one blood

I'm from the Westside of the six-four Impala
Where niggas say ""Where you from?""
We don't never say ""Harlem""
Bandanna on the right side, gun on the left side
Niggas in New York know how to throw up the Westside
Word to Eazy, I'm so ill, believe me
I made room for Jeezy
But the rest of you niggas better be glad you breathing
All I need is one reason
I'm the king, and Dre said it: the West Coast need me
I don't know why you niggas keep trying me
Everybody know that I'm the heir to the Aftermath dynasty
And I ain't gotta make shit for the club
What DJ gon' turn down the thirty-eight snub?
You 38 and you still rapping? Ughhh
I'm 26, nigga, so is the dubs
On the '07 Hummer, hop out, no bodyguards
When the chronic smoke clear all you gon' see is

One blood
One blood
One blood
One blood
Blood, blood, blood, blood-blood-blood
Blood, blood, blood, blood-blood-blood
Blood, blood, blood, blood-blood-blood
One blood, one blood, one blood, one blood

I ain't got beef with 50, no beef with Jay
What's beef when you getting head in the six-trey?
And the double Game chain, I keep 'em on display
Black T-shirt, so all you see is the A
Turn on the TV, and all you see is the A
You niggas better make up a dance and try to get radio play
Keep on snapping your fingers, I ain't going away
I don't regret what I spit, 'cause I know what I say
And niggas talking about me, they don't know when to stop
I got the Louis Vuitton belt buckle holding the Glock
No beam, no silencer; I know when to pop
Wait 'til Lil Jon come on and let off a shot
I had the number one billboard spot
Niggas stepped on my fingers, and I climb right back to the top
I'm B.I.G., I'm Cube, I'm Nas, I'm Pac
This ain't shit but a warning 'til my album drop

Chased that nigga down, put him on WorldStar
Bitch nigga got away in his girl car
Put that pussy on the net like a porn star
Another weenie with bread, he a corn dog
Put three holes in his head like a bowlin' ball
I'm out the gutta switchin' lanes in a stolen car
Fuck the feds 'cause a nigga got a murder charge
Fuck it though, got the cover of the Murder Dog
I dress up like the pizza man, load the Desert Eagle and

Drop this joint album and we'll kill niggas""

You gotta be there for me through the casualties
You see my trials and my tribulations
You can tell them demons tryna capture me

You was bool with it, wasn't you?
Talkin' 'bout when a nigga gonna leave the block alone
But you never say this shit when I'm fucking you

How you make a nigga spend a million dollars on purses?
Then have an attitude
Like you in the studio helping a nigga write verses
Had a nigga focused on the future, now a nigga feeling like Future

And we ain't kill 'em yet, nigga, I salute you
And I still bang like I used to, red Impala, gold things like I used to
Pick up my kids, they don't see none of that
But when I'm back in the hood I'm yelling soo woo!
And it was all good just a week ago
Shit, we was Nicki and Meek a week ago
Gave you everything, the watch, the house, the cards
Tatted your passport, and now you wanna see me low
Wanna take my pussy, give it to the next nigga free

You pulling out heat, I draw the heat too

Aftermath in that ass, bitch
Game, let's go

Me and Marshall ain't start shit, they listen to our shit
They talk shit about us but that shit is foul when
I'm tryna feed my son and drop multi-platinum albums
Make my mother proud that her son made it out
But it's hard when they hate us, and think Em a racist
They say shit but fuck them, Shady one of the greatest
Like Biggie and 'Pac was, we saw the throne was empty
And decided to chase it, me, him and 50 racin'
This rap shit is basic, I followed that Jay shit
Think of what I wanna say, step in the booth and one-take it
How could I not sell a million when I'm rappin' on Dre hits
Then spit that classical L.A. N.W.A shit
The media is bullshit, now we can't even say bitch
They accusin' Michael of touchin' kids in the wrong places
At first they embraced him, had a couple of facelifts
Now people wanna place him with murderers and rapists
They comin', I can taste this, swear to God I ain't racin'
Put the clip in and waste 'em before I go out on that fake shit

Way do you wanna face when your brains hit pavement?
Think of what you'll say to Pastor Mase and save it
For the day that they got them affidavits waving
In my face, looking for answers, rap sensation
Eminem battles to ward off accusations
That he had somebody blasted, 
the mask of Jason
Was found at the scene of the task with masking tape
And the victim's penis up his ass, a basket case

Turn down my Jimi Hendrix, I'll throw your demo out the window
For telling me it's hot, when it's not and you got
What you got from them rocks, on the block, you just stopped

Sometimes I gotta step in the church, cause I ain't tryin' to go to hell
As the blood spills from my pen
It's time to confess my sins, cause I ain't tryin' to go to hell
I smoke weed, pop pills, but I'm thinkin' it's time for me to chill
Cause I ain't tryin' to go to hell
I'm tryin' to get some head tonight, have a stripper in my bed tonight
But I ain't tryin' to go to hell

Father forgive me, cause I ain't perfect
No, no no no
Why is everything wrong?
Oh I can't get it right, I always try to get it right

Dre promised me records, I never got 'em
That's why I had nightmares that a nigga shot him
For all my albums missed records
Felt he shitted on me for Kendrick, recorded diss records
And Kendrick, my nigga, put him on his first mixtape
I pop champagne when I heard he was with Dre
And I'm tellin' y'all this true story cause I'm real
Dre, first time, hearing 'bout it, wonder how he feel
Cause I feel like shit severin' the relationship
The only doctor I knew to make all of his patients rich
Snoop, Pac, Em, 50, me, K. Dot, watch us do a 360
Plus 
The Documentary
 saved me from penitentiaries
I ain't trippin', niggas been disloyal for centuries
Finally got the crown, this motherfucker meant for me
Funny how you do your top 5's and don't mention me
Fuck 'em all

Father forgive me, cause I ain't perfect
No, no no no
Why is everything wrong?
Oh I can't get it right, I always try to get it right

See I been spendin' these late nights
On girls I never see again
Constantly intoxicated
Only God could save me, yeah
With 'em by the sunrise
One day everyone dies
That's the way the story goes
But now, I can't feel my heart
But I just keep ridin', ridin'
Feel so numb, numb, oh yeah

Father forgive me, cause I ain't perfect
No, no no no
Why is everything wrong?
Oh I can't get it right, I always try to get it right",https://genius.com/The-game-cant-get-right-lyrics
Name Me King,Jesus Piece,2012.0,"Open the pearly gates, 
bright white lights Madonna
Angels lined up in my honor,
 your honor
Name Me King
Name Me King
I took the crown, infiltrated their fortress
Kidnap the queen, rode away on white horses
Name Me King
Name Me King

Brick by brick I built my fortress
My queen beautiful, Lamborghini is gorgeous
Phantom in the courtyard, 400 horses
Growl made the towers fall, 911 Porsches
Number 9 Jordans pause the Air Forces
Kush clouds, blunts lit by Olympic torches
Gold bars melted and what returned Rolexes
Niggas got Breitlings to burn
Loyalty to earn
Royalty to who it may concern this is Los Angeles King Snapback
Sipping 'tron out the Stanley cup, I don't give a fuck
Drown them in the moat and let the bridge up
My son, my heir in Nike Airs,
 named my little nigga King
Meaning you should bow at his feet before God intervene
Even when I was in front of triple beams
Stack paper to the ceiling,
 
to the fiends I was king

Open the pearly gates, 
bright white lights Madonna
Angels lined up in my honor,
 your honor
Name Me King
Name Me King
I took the crown, infiltrated their fortress
Kidnap the queen, rode away on white horses
Name Me King
Name Me King

Raise your glass for the last of the kingpins
The crown in the Maserati grill is mingling
Rollies cross oceans like Frank out in England
The Gay Pride bezel rainbow like it's spring again
Haah crack rock, crack rock nigga
My SC430 was a drop nigga
Go figure, this nigga play Go Fish
My only pet was fish scale not a goldfish
My young baby sitter now my old bitch
Blowjobs cause what I sold made her nose itch
(EUGHK!) It's the king being crowned
Watch my predecessor fall like the sun going down (God!)
It's sunset, this is Sun Tzu (War!)
He paved the way I brought a ton through (Whooo!)
Been on his heels like a gum shoe
 (EUGHK!)
He took the throne so I could run through

Open the pearly gates, 
bright white lights Madonna
Angels lined up in my honor,
 your honor
Name Me King
Name Me King
I took the crown, infiltrated their fortress
Kidnap the queen, rode away on white horses
Name Me King
Name Me King

Rose petals at my feet when I'm stepping out the Rolls
The royal penis is clean, Versace belt gold
Sweatin' like a slave where them pies get sold
Accompanied by fourteen karats stold
Adjust the temperature let the heat rise up
Like Jesus Shuttlesworth
 in that glass jar
Blue flame glowing like a Avatar
Five more minutes says the silent gold hand going 'round on my Audemar
Angels in the wing, ass naked do your thing
Show me what that baking soda bring, do it for your king
Every time I look up, they cook up
I be the master of them P's I got the hook up
From New Orleans to Virginia
I told her stuff them pies in her Virginia
Never been caught, can't be bought, she's a winner
Fly 'em south for the winter make it back home for dinner

Open the pearly gates, 
bright white lights Madonna
Angels lined up in my honor,

From Adam,The Documentary 2.5,2015.0,"Here we go again
Ten years later
You know what man? Uhm
(""I wanna know!"")
Fuck it
Ayo C
Give me that Jameson and that pickle juice
Thank you
I got some shit on my mind
(""I wanna know!"")

My little nigga Frogg dead, dog
They shot my little nigga in his head, dog
You heard what the fuck I just said, dog?
Walk inside my closet like fuck everything red, dog
If you seen your best friend stiff, you would cry too
Sometimes I don't even wanna be a Piru
Then I think about it like, fuck everything blue
Who killed my motherfuckin' brother?
(""I wanna know!"")
Who killed G man too? The shit I seen men do
If I told you, I'd have me floating in some cement shoes
See Compton ain't shit really
And I’ve been at the bottom of the pits, feel me?
I done had some real niggas try to kill me
Fake niggas in my crew
Crip niggas more loyal than a few of my Piru
I done been shot, had a surgery or two
Above the rim like Pac, I’m like birdie at the troops
I can’t lie, every time I see Suge my heart beat
Cause I don’t know if I should dap him or let the hawk speak
Wilmington and Brazil, nigga them my cross streets
And who gon’ take it from me?

They think they know me
But they do not know me
Cause I do not know me
Who killed my homie?
I wanna know names
Click-clack explain
I can kill you but ain’t nothing gon' change
But I might do it anyway
You gonna die any way
I’m gonna die any way
We can go any day
It can be any day
But for you
Today is the day
Today is the day

I was playing Madden then I heard a knock
Everybody know I got shot but this for niggas that forgot
Sometimes I thank God that I got set up
When you shot twice in the chest, it's kinda hard to keep your head up
Suspect one: the homies never came to see me
Suspect two: Red hid my gun behind the TV
Suspect three: I was beefing with this Crip in my apartment
Shit started cause we fought and he couldn't see me
There's usually ten niggas in our dope spot
Cold ass night, I'm like a janitor at Wing Stop
I usually play Xbox with the gun cocked
I'm cool with taking mine, but I took other niggas' gunshots
Chest wide open, I'm tryna fight, but my lungs not
Hole in my chest bout the size of a kumquat
I know who shot me 'cause I shot them
But who set me up? I ain't tripping but—
(""I wanna know!"")

They think they know me
But they do not know me
Cause I do not know me
Who killed my homie?
I wanna know names
Click-clack explain
I can kill you but ain’t nothing gonna change
But I might do it anyway
You gonna die any way
I’m gonna die any way
We can go any day
It can be any day
But for you
Today is the day
Today is the day

Let me tell you how I met my nigga Wack
Shit, he ain't always have a nigga back
When I met him, he was standing behind Suge
And everything is all good when you banging for your hood
Compton
That nigga Wack got my number and came through
Now let me tell you the type of shit the Game do
He walked in the booth where I was spitting
Gave him ten thousand, couldn't even finish his fuckin' sentence
I ain't owe him shit, but real recognize real
Now we like two red-nosed Pits
Cross him, you gotta cross me
And don't forget about where my nigga AR be
He be in the cut, that niggas nuts, don't give a fuck
Love his nigga Game to death, and he mean it from the guts
Blood, what's up? Which one of you dumb mothafuckas wanna try us?

I didn't mean to walk away

I guess my mind just drew a blank, like la-la-la
Now I'm sittin' in this god damned cage
Rreminiscin' about my day with your blood all over my slate
As the devil sings la-la-la

Dre, I ain't mean to turn my back on you
But I'm a man, and sometimes a man, do what he gotta do
Remember, I'm from Compton too
I saw you and Eazy in 'em, so I started wearin' Khaki suits
I was 12 smokin' chronic, in '92
I had a choice, be like Mike, or be like you
I made a choice, now its be Crip or be Piru
Whatever I was, I was bangin' Gin & Juice
Never knew back then, I'd be friends with Snoop
Now I gotta keep it gangsta, 'cause its in my roots
So I owe you my life, when I betrayed you
I tried to think of what the fuck, Eminem might do
If every nigga hated him, for the Black Bitch track
And niggas stopped bumpin' Dre after Dee Barnes got slapped
When Doc say its a wrap, its a wrap
Its still Aftermath, and ain't nothing after that

I didn't mean to walk away
But I hear every word they say
I guess my mind just drew a blank, like la-la-la
Now I'm sittin' in this god damned cage
Rreminiscin' about my day with your blood all over my slate
As the devil sings la-la-la

I never said Thank You, and I took for granted
You let me in your house, and made me a part of your family
Now I'm eatin' with you, Eve, and Busta Rhymes
I wasn't starstruck, I was just glad to be signed
And even though sometimes I run loose
You still my homeboy Doc, I'd take a bullet for you
I'm not askin' you to take my side in the beef
But you told me it was okay to say Fuck The Police
Now its my turn to carry the torch
And I still got the chain that you wore on the cover of The Source
Remember when we got drunk, to do Start From Scratch?
I told you, you was like a father to me I meant that
Sittin' here lookin' at my platinum plaques
Thinkin' what the fuck am I without a Doctor Dre track
When Doc say its a wrap, its a wrap
Its still Aftermath, and ain't nothin' after that

I didn't mean to walk away
But I hear every word they say
I guess my mind just drew a blank, like la-la-la
Now I'm sittin' in this god damned cage
Rreminiscin' about my day with your blood all over my slate
As the devil sings la-la-la

See when the world is on your shoulder and the stress grows bigger
The fire in 'em, made it difficult to talk to the nigga
Most of the time I let 'em know, I don't agree with what he do
But he a hardhead Dre, that's why I'm talkin' to you
See, when I first met my nigga, son was layin' in the cut
Type reserved, homie was quite and kept his mouth shut
Until you told him to spit for me, he flippin' from the gut
I dug his spirit, and I thought the dude was talented as fuck
As time went on, now he was workin' with the finest
I saw the pressure started to build, so I gave additional guidance
You gave him something that can make or break a nigga, you should face it
So big, I don't even think he was ready to embrace it
With the potential to be a strong nigga with conviction
The only problem was our little nigga wouldn't listen
But when Doc say its a wrap, it's a wrap
Its still Aftermath and ain't nothing after that

I didn't mean to walk away
But I hear every word they say
I guess my mind just drew a blank, like la-la-la
Now I'm sittin' in this god damned cage

Wanna talk money? Yeah, count it, ten milli
Free my nigga Meek Milly, bad bitch out of Philly
Sold that white girl so I guess I sold Iggy
Who you think I give a fuck about, an enemy?
Think I give a fuck about the industry?
Pussy ass nigga better Google me

Boy I had a white car back in '04
Back in running wood days and ridin' low
When bein' a street nigga really meant something
Now niggas sell his soul for a follow
If you wanna talk streets, what it mean to you niggas?
Take pictures with guns so that make you a killer?
Nah, L.A. Reid gave me that check today
Took that shit to the 'jects, empowered the hittas
I'm Crenshaw at Fatburger, fuckin' with Nipsey
And I bet you I'm rockin' my chains
Or I'm in the Watts with Jay Rock
Or slidin' through Compton with Game
Cause real niggas livin' the same

My partner did a decade so what the fuck you really mean?

Skrt, skrt, skrt, skrt, dinner fork

I told that bitch there to get out when she finished
Need me a bitch that's gon' suck me and fuck me
And freak me and pass me to all of her friends, that's what it is

Big Meech mixed with Yeezy

Got a fresh hairline from Peter
Got me a hockey mask, choppers start talking fast
Give it to 'em direct just like Jeter, uhh
Niggas ain't killing shit

I'm not finna  play with you, homie get laid with you
Cement your feet, then it's off in the lake with you
Underestimate you, that mistake I couldn't make with you
I hit you with the K myself and show you what the paper do
And can't nobody handle you the way I do
I'll give a boy a K or two, kill you in a day or two

Fuck around, stomp you out in these Durant's or somethin'
I bear arms like Durantula
This rocket launcher'll blow your whole fuckin' mansion up
And everybody gotta die, put them candles up
How you get caught up in the web with tarantulas?
And for you fuckin' dumb niggas, let me slow it down
I can screw you like Pimp and Big Moe around
And when a nigga say ""Timber"", you don't need Ricky Rubio
To let a nigga know it's goin' down, fuck you clowns
Yeah, I put the word on you niggas
Go A$AP Ferg on you niggas
Been all through New York with Diddy
My verse'll Schmurda you niggas
And that's not a shot at TIP or a shot at Gotti
Take shots of Ciroc in a black Bugatti
Got a shotty in a backpack, napsack
Shawty got a black MAC 11, I will catch that body
Like Nasir and Hov when I'm 40 years old
I will still be the pilot that light up the stove
And be cookin' that crack 'til the Doctor come back
And tell niggas that ""Detox"" come out this October
Like Ol' Dirty Bastard, I'm finally sober
And verses like this'll get me a new Rover
Get you a new home and a casket, you bastard
Your funeral boring, I'm glad that it's over

Kill a nigga in his Monte Carlo like Alonzo
Sold records, sold crack, nigga, recognize
For the record, I've been wreckin' shit since '05
No lie, J's on
Take these motherfuckas off and throw the Ye's on
Rewind, J's on
Take these motherfuckas off and throw the Ye's on
Yeezy, tell these niggas that they is slaves
Master want you on red carpet like yesterday
You a house nigga, I'ma get away though
Come back kill master ass like Django
Most you niggas just rapping for the fame though
I start rapping to get the fuck out this durango
What goes around comes around, how that saying go?

Feelin' lonely
Let me know if you're feelin' crazy
I guess all that stuff they told me
In my life was extra shady
I should've kept 'em waitin'
Say hello to the mula
I'm on top, no lie
Say hello to the mula
I'm on top, good night
[Verse 2: The Game & 
Kanye West

Back like I never left, nigga I'm on my second breath
And I got another track from Yeezy
How'd you do that? Like Eric Wright said Eazy
Pull up in my cool whip, I don't give a fuck about it
Leave it at the valet, I ain't fucked up about it
I'll call an Uber, nigga, I'll fuckin' shoot a nigga
I got a white bitch that blow like a tuba, nigga
I just got a new crib, I just got a new Wraith
I just got cooler than LL Cool J
I just got a new gun, squeeze it like some toothpaste
I, I, (aghhhhk)
Spit in the face of a coward
Shit on anybody ever try to take ours
Ye why that nigga's face so sour?
Cause that slick mouth got him wet up like a shower
Now what you know about power?
What you know about dreams?
What you know about freestylin' versus each other
Shelter outside of Nike Town without a dollar in your jeans

"Like Father, Like Son",The Documentary,2005.0,"June 30th, 11:07 I got that call
She eight centimeters, my lil' man 'bout to fall
Scuffin my Air Forces, runnin through the hospital hall
Deja vu, like I been here before
I'm feelin reborn, like a Bed-Stuy breddern
My first born, Dre I'm bout to have a Bad Boy
Family in the lobby, see my nigga Church, whatup
Shit, I left the camcorder in the truck
Runnin through the maternity ward, out of breath, sweatin
I swear to God every minute's startin to feel like a second
I see hell starin down the barrel of a Smith and Wesson
My son's ultrasound the closest I ever been to heaven
Lord forgive me for my sins, I know it's last minute
Put the chronic in the air, a lil' hash in it
Spread my wings, if only I could fly
Why fight to live homie if we livin to die?

I hope you grow up to become that everything you can be
That's all I wanted for you young'n, like father, like son
But in the end I hope you'll only turn out better than me
I hope you know I love you young'n, like father, like son
My little man your day is coming
Coming, your day is coming
I tell ya, and when it comes just keep it running
Running, just keep it running, I tell you

They say every time somebody die, a child is born
So I thank the nigga who gave his life for the birth of my son
11:32, she screamin at the top of her lungs
I'm panicking, nurse yellin for the doctor to come
All I can remember was Lemaze class, breathe baby
One (one) two (two) three (three) four (four)
I see the head, Doc bustin through the door
He between the legs, he see the head, it's my baby boy!
11:46 the head out, she screamin makin crazy noise
Pain is love, my stomach foldin like a La-Z-Boy
I'm feelin like Mariah Carey, all these butterflies
Voices singin to me sound like Teena Marie
I'm callin niggas on tour
Jayo tell Spinz I just cut the umbilical cord
11:57, a soldier is born
And he's flesh of my flesh, young Harlem Caron

I hope you grow up to become that everything you can be
That's all I wanted for you young'n, like father, like son
But in the end I hope you'll only turn out better than me
I hope you know I love you young'n, like father, like son
My little man your day is coming
Coming, your day is coming
I tell ya, and when it comes just keep it running
Running, just keep it running, I tell you

I wanna thank Dr. Aswork and Nurse Teresa
For bringin my baby boy to life, you birthed a Caesar
And my baby momma Alyska, for pushin out a ten pound
Four ounce Mini-Me, I still can't believe it
Nose ears eyes chin, just like your daddy
I'd die before you grow up and be just like your daddy
Or your grandfather; call Uncle Zeb
Tell him I got a son and I ain't even in Harlem
I'm poppin Crist' wit'cha godfathers
Baron Davis and D. Mac, Darrius Rogers
Drop the top on the '71
With my face in the clouds, Lord spare my son
And watch over Eric Wright, T'yanna, and Lil' Pun

If I bust five times, and they never see the sun

Holy Water,Jesus Piece,2012.0,"My Phantom so mean
Like I washed that motherfucker every Sunday in holy water
My Jesus piece clean
Even my shoes are Christians, I'm walking on holy water
She came out them True Religion jeans
And fell straight to her knees like she was dipped in holy water
Holy water
Holy water

Back when Michael Jordan was raw
'92
 
was the year my city was city of God
Coke on the boulevard, crack fiends skiing the slaloms
Is exactly how drug lords found their way from the bottom
Them Yeezy's drop got 'em, couldn't afford 'em you shot 'em
Cause they the same price as fucking red bottoms
We don't pop tags, leave that motherfucker on it
Return it back to the store when you no longer want it
Sleep outside for days for a pair of J's
Then you sleep outside forever cause you got sprayed
If you gon' die for em, they better be some number 4's
Or some shit made in Japan you can never find in the stores
Rolex watches, Gucci belts, and Louis luggage
Definitely set us apart from niggas when we in public
Jeffery Campbell and Michael Kors got you looking rugged
Gave her a Louis bag, now she love me
Take a look at her posin' on my car cause

My Phantom so mean
Like I washed that motherfucker every Sunday in holy water
My Jesus piece clean
Even my shoes are Christians, I'm walking on holy water
She came out them True Religion jeans
And fell straight to her knees like she was dipped in holy water
Holy water
Holy water

Met a girl named Christian in some Christian, she a Christian
Suck a dick like sucking dick is her life's mission
Trynna' save her ass like trynna' save a stripper
She fine as fuck, you trynna' fuck, that's the reason you tip her
And all I'm sayin' is a watch and a gold chain
Can't make Bobby Valentino, Johnny Coltrane
And she knows this, that's why her mouth wide
Openin' up her legs straight up like they suicide
I cross my heart and hope to die
If something happens to my voice and can no longer provide
Should I run and hide? No. hustle and survive
Workin' 9 to 5 until sweat drips into my eyes
And if it burns like the kush, then I go back to sellin' pies
Switchin' lanes in that Cutlass,
 rubbin' her thighs while I drive
Reminiscin' on the days I was rollin' broke
Jesus piece on the rearview, holy ghost
Amen!

Nigga don't trip

Don't trip, Blood
I make it rain in Compton like it's a strip club
I grew up on Santana block, that's where the Crips was
My mama house was in the middle of the street
How was a nigga supposed to get to school?
I hopped every backyard on my block
Till I got to  Elm Street, took the rag out my sock
And I could have been a Crip but I ain't like blue that much
All Crip school, I ain't really go to school that much
I was selling crack on Elm, bagging up sacks on Elm
With the ratchet in my Bulls jacket, giving you the facts on Elm
King Frog and Big Face had my back on Elm
We was fighting over territory with the T-Flats on Elm
I had to scrap on Elm, that's how I got my stripes
Air Max 95s, not a scratch on my Nikes
2016 motherfucker, don't you pull it
'Cause I made it out of Compton with a stab wound and five bullets

'Cause I'm bool like that, I'm bool like that
I'm bool like that, yeah I'm bool like that
They say ""Game, why you always act a fool like that?""
'Cause I went to Compton High Crip School like that
I was Blood and I ain't really like blue like that
They was Crippin they ain't give a fuck who like that
Them niggas jumped me, why they have to do a 'Ru like that?
Nigga went and got the homies and we flew right back
They C like that, we B like that
We trip like that cause LA sick like that
We Blood like that, we Crip like that
The blunt lit like that, we out

When you ready, lemme know
When you want it, lemme know, I got it
When you see me, congratulate a nigga, don't hate
Niggas will always be niggas, yep, true
That's why I don't trip on these niggas, would you?
Niggas is wild like gorillas that's stuck in that zoo, yep

Daytona 500 (500 Bars),UnKnown,2011.0,"Hov invented swag, I'll give him that
But who invented slime about the niggas in the fitted caps?
Reppin Cincinnati, they ain't ever been there
I'm working the track out, no Under Armour gym wear
Fuck bad bitches, check my list, see Kim there
Stacey Dash, I'll smash and pass
And nut on they face like it's skin care
Can't get rid of me, the Game gon' be here
Like teachers with they tenure
No pen here, straight off the dome
I throw a shot, blacka, knock him straight off his throne
That goes for every nigga, the nigga with the lockjaw
And that heavy nigga, I ain't talking about Ross
He the mother fucking boss, 
I'm the CEO
Niggas using they Skymiles just to see me flow
I've got the Illmatic CD flow
Fake diamonds, fake kaballah beads, nigga CB4
I'm gettin' tired of these niggas, feds puttin' wires on these niggas
I got some Richard Pryors for these niggas
Couple court cases, couple shell cases
Trickling off the ground right next to where the Ace is
I can't take this shit that I'm seeing in the industry
I'd rather be everybody's enemy in the back of the strip club
Guzzling some Hennessy; 
I really made it rain with Meech
I got memories
Fuck with em here, blow out your memory
Take the roof off of the Chevy, we ride Kennedy
Like a bottle of Patron, one nigga can't finish me
Whoop a nigga's ass, he'll tell the cops there was 10 of me
Ice on my neck, I ain't ever had an injury
Ice on my wrists, I ain't ever had an injury

Platinum plates on the

Welcome to mi casa

Big bowl of OG kush, 
watching Shottas
Nigga take a hit of that, it's California kush, five
You ain't gotta send it back
Quarterback, nigga I got the center back
Get Charlie Sheen on the phone, tell him to win it back
The summer over nigga, tell them that the winter back
Take that boy crown, bitch nigga, come get it back
Snapback? Fuck that, authentic fitted cap
Nigga talk shit, then it's off with his fitted cap
Off with his fitted cap
Let these niggas know that the boss of the city back
I need a 7 5/8 Philly hat
Rozay, where that nigga Meek Milly at?
Where Beans, where Chris, where Gillie at?
Can't stop bloodin', I'm a fucking hemophiliac
1st nigga on the set with a red rag
Then the industry took my whole swag
Pound sign, dag, and all of you niggas is fucking fags
I dare you come play up on the boy curb
20 niggas with me, can't one of them spell ""hors d'oeuvres""
Pearl handle, 
but I don't eat oysters
Catch 'em in the hood, 24's on that Porsche
Annulment, had to divorce her
She ain't wanna get in the truck, I had to force her
Heard she wasn't giving it up, you had to force her
Buy homegirl some bottles to intercourse her
Where they do that at? Where my bloods at?
Where my soo woo rag?
 Where my lil nigga
From where they do voodoo at?
Four albums all number ones, go and Google that
So I'm banned like the number ones
How you try to make it rain with 100 ones
Nigga, I'm married to the game, no cummerbund
Everyday I'm in the Range with another gun
I snipe ya... no Wesley
I'm the king, motherfuck Elvis Presley
I'm the king and I be smoking, dare a nigga come and test me
Put two 9's on your back, Wayne Gretzky
Yo, I'm ahead, they can't catch me
5 to 10 and over, nigga, arrest me
I be out tomorrow, my lawyer'd beat that
Now nigga, go and tweet that
I just did, nigga, re-tweet that
And tell Floyd I've been workin' on the speed bag
He don't fight Pacquiao, then I'm up next
Cut his eyes like Jimmy Iovine cut checks
I'm a millionaire, nigga, fuck stress
Put me on Basketball Wives, it'd be a fuckfest
Shout out to Funk Flex,
 
Shout out to DJ Clue
Shout out to DJ Skee
, 
Shout out to DJ Pooh
He gon' cry when he get in the car
Like I cried blood tears when I was gettin' the star
Like I told Vida Guerra she wasn't gettin' that far
Got some head, then I kicked that bitch up out of the car
But look at the bright side, it was a SLR
And you've been kicked out worse, don't act like I was the first
Then came Amber, alert
You ain't 'posed to talk about a nigga wife, but she squirt
Like a soda can, I can murder this beat if Yeezy and Hova can
So here we go again
Pounds of the kush, and couple of my oldest friends
Last week, I was in my Uncle Otis' Benz
Back it up into the throne, it's totaled then
Only had it for a week, it ain't broken in
I'll prolly never be king, it's kinda soakin' in
Heard I'd never go big, from Napoleon
He had a complex, all I got is concepts
Classics, legendary straight up out the projects
San Diego Aztec, number one prospect
Aston Martin, that's a foreign object
Phantoms, 'rraris, wasn't 25 yet
Lambos,
 
Mazzis
, 
wasn't sayin' 5 yet
17 million, my son wasn't 5 yet
Disrespect the whole rap game and ain't die yet
Hov, lets make a side bet
I'm a J. Cole fan, can a nigga drop next?
(Damn, I mean he got a good thing)
Yeah, call Pay Per View: can me and 50 box yet?
Dr. Dre, can I hear Detox yet?
Yeah, I got some singles on that bitch
Where that ho Maliah at, got some singles for that bitch
Turn on the radio, got some singles on that bitch
Pot of Gold, Me and Kris Kringle on that bitch
Goin' HAM in the club, you should see me in this bitch
Spades bottle tall as Bobby Valentino in this bitch
How it turn into Casino in this bitch
Tell 'em it's Gee Money, I'm with Nino in this bitch
On my toes like a ballerina in this bitch
No Prodigy at Summer Jam screamin' in this bitch
Child prodigy, Bobby Fischer leanin' in this bitch
Alpo ass niggas ain't want to see me gettin' rich
Too late for that though, I got cash flow
Young Fidel Castro, actin' like a asshole
And I don't know better
I ain't know if this a Louis Vuitton or Polo sweater
To me the YSL logo better
Watch a knock-off cause these hoes know better
I made The Documentary, 
I'll be rich forever
Like my nickname Dick, I'll be rich forever
Pause...
 now applaud, and let these real Hip-Hop fans count my bars
Let these real Hip-Hop haters count my cars
Back to Swishers, fuck a Cuban cigar
Unless it's handed to me by a Cuban
All these haters on my Dirk so I might as well smoke it with Mark Cuban
Old nigga New York knees, Ewing
Kyrie Irving give a fuck about a 2 inch
Got these bitches giving me brains, so stupid
Finally got the Otis instrumental, had to loop it
New school rapper shot by Cupid, stupid
Everybody sayin' they sick, I got lupus
And I'm still on the block, like the New Kids
I got a few kids, I got a few cribs
I got a new kid so I bought a new crib
2.5 stupid, not a new crib
50 helped a nigga out, but the truth is
All of this shit from one freestyle on Whoo Kid
If I ain't the king, then nigga tell me who is
If I ain't won the west the last 9 years
, who did?
I'll wait, while I'm starin' at my Hublot
In my Blackberry looking for bitches that do blow
Used to push weight, like a sumo
Give it to my bitch, let her stuff it in the culot
Take it to the visitor room, give it to Bruno
He nickel bag and slide it in the new box of Uno
But that's too much inf, for the you know
Where I'm from a rat'll never give orders to Bluto
I heard your lil' album, kudos
They say the shit a classic, nigga, I got a few of those
A few hoes, new clothes, like I'm Jason Derulo
So nigga step to the side like a Euro
And a nigga get too close
Louisville slugga to the dome, Pujols
Niggas don't like Game, they a bunch of puntos
I'm sippin' mojitos with Ms. Puerto Rico
Drew League floor seats, Durant shootin' free throws
Back to the spot, left eye in the peep hole
A1 Perico, stay up out my stash
I'm just a middle man, niggas fuckin' up my cash
Police pull me over, now they fuckin' with my dash
2 blocks to go, toss that shit up in the trash
2 Glocks'll blow, put a bullet in your ass
Like Plaxico, got you jettin' up the Ave
I swear to god man, these niggas make me laugh
'Pposed to be my future, you ain't fuckin' with my past
I shoot first, ask questions last
Kobe mind state, why the fuck would I pass?
Boost crime rate, then make Twitter crash
All in one day with my controversial ass
My grandmama SMH my mama like damn
The hoes LOLing and my niggas goin' HAM
Run your lips like Gina, shit get thick like Pam
This a bloodsport, Jean Claude Van Damme
180 bars, man damn
Love Farrakhan but I'm 'bout to go HAM
You hear what I just said? Nigga damn
I love the beef, but I'm 'bout to go HAM

Open my garage, see cars like a motherfucker
Walk up in the club, see broads like a motherfucker
Bitches pulling titties out of bras like a motherfucker
Ace of spades, black card like a motherfucker
You niggas broke, RushCard like a motherfucker
Outside the club plush cars like a motherfucker
And we ain't rent shit, these ours like a mother ucker
But fuck with my niggas, see stars like a motherfucker
Snoop, Busta and Nas they my motherfuckers
2V2's and AR like a motherfucker
Kid Red, Wackstar like a motherfucker
Slept on it but this Otis beat, hard as a motherfucker
Drums weak as fuck, need Mars like a motherfucker
Give a drummer some
Bitch get on your knees and give a plumber some
I'm leakin', 
sound like Just Blaze in this bitch
Its black wall kiss my black balls, the K's in this bitch
N dot W dot A in this bitch
Game ball hard need a agent and shit
Any one of you niggas can get blazed in this bitch
And we could fight to the death put a cage in this bitch
200 for the Yacht, where the spades in this bitch?
I got them white bitches plankin' like slaves on the ship
Import, export, feds on the landing strip, meet me at the next port
And abort the operation if I text y'all
Nevermind that, my connect be the escort
Let's rewind that, back to my mama Escort
Keys overseas way before I had a passport
Keys in the trunk '95 Honda Passport
I got whatever you need, ain't gotta ask for it
Its a Dillinger in the V stuffed in the dash board
Nigga been fucking with rock, no Damon Dash boy
And it's a damn shame what happened to Dame
He ain't even get to keep his Roc-A-Fella chain
Or the Rocawear chain, or the Armadale liquor
You was already down, nigga ain't have to kick ya
With ya own Pro Keds, in yo forehead
Nigga treats his own friends like the dope heads
Guess he Scarface and you Frank Lopez
This here holy water, put that on the Pope head
Something like a Priest nigga nothing like a pastor
When that 
R.E.D.
 drop just prepare for the rapture
Lock me out of Canada, balling like the Raptors
Shit don't even matter, name floating in the rafters
Got the 44 on me call me Tom Raper
Roll it up in the Phantom and blow it up out the Aston
All they see is 
R.E.D.
 I'm holding up all this traffic
They tellin' me I'm sick, but I'm sittin' fat like Magic
Bars, Tragic, niggas know im a savage
Won't appreciate it til years after I perish
Be a old nigga ballin' yeah Robert Parish
With a white bitch, cornrows, looking like Bo Derek
Got my white bitch in the hood, I call her Kreayshawn
She better stay between the lines like a crayon
Cause the block is something I spent all day on
Posted up with something long as the nigga Tayshaun
And I'm off probation, so I'm back in the kitchen, Raekwon
This is just a intermission, stay calm
262 Bars, Naplam
Thats 238 to go, this for my unsigned niggas just waiting to blow
I know its niggas 'round your hood just hatin' ya flow
Baby mama in ya pockets steady taking your dough
It's gon' be goons in the crowd, niggas hating your show
Couple niggas hidin' that love, they just hatin' to show
But what don't kill you, only make you stronger
Twenty minute sets, stay on ten minutes longer
I was just like you, still got the hunger
Couldn't see in the dark, feelin' like Stevie Wonder
Waitin' on my turn when Dre pulled my number
I was Spongebob for the next three summers
Then I did numbers, mama I made it
Took the Unit under, still got haters
Die hard fans from Compton to Decatur
Ten million sold, still carry the lasers
Said I still carry the lasers, Lupe what up!
Still got D, G Wall for the blazers
Still pack Heat don't make a nigga D-Wade ya
Don't make me get on my phone and call my pager
Translation them my shooters, Pacers
Niggas say they really got heart, but them is pacers
New West niggas is spitters, razors
Tyler the Creator, K Dot, Jay Rock
Glasses, Crooked, your boy got the bay locked
But me an Tyga got the hoes, 
Baywatch
Meaning we put on a show, while they watch
Watch us hustle like Nipsey
30 bottles of spades, nigga we ain't even tipsy
So with that rap shit, miss me
All these niggas pussy won't nobody diss me
Nigga I don't blame ya, better do ya history
Every nigga that tried, died a motherfuckin' mystery
Fuckin' with the misfit
You got company I'll kill that motherfucker
See what I did to Fifth shit
That's why I'm always popping big shit
I love New York that's why I'm always bumping B.I.G.'s shit
Kick in the door waving the four four
All you heard was the four four
Niggas jumping out the window on the fourth floor
But the bitch was scared to jump so I put her on all fours
Four albums, four plaques
, phantom, four doors
I'm the only five, you niggas is all fours
That ain't a classic album, nigga you off course
You need to call Blaze, Swizz Beatz or Scott Storch
Bon'jour wake up in Paris
Sippin on Conjure mix it with cranberry
Baby what kinds yours?
We up on the top floor niggas
On the bottom we can see a lot more
Baby I'm a problem
If I see a spade and he sippin' on Spades, I'mma call him
Word to my son Harlem
Ya boy used to ski in coke, I'm talking slaloms
Courtside next to Snoop sitting with starlets
I got a thing for red bones and Louis wallets
See the watch making them drool, 'cause its retarded
See the cops pointing at dude 'cause he a target
The world is a shooting range, so I'm aiming at the Shy
And I'mma hit that mother fucker in the newest Range
Hit the south side, doing two and change
Watching Otis so I pulled over and blew the brains
Man its cold out this motherfucker Gucci Mane
Brr, chinchilla fur
Ain't have to move to Texas but I'm in that flying spur
Don't work with Petco but I could flip the bird
Who got snaps on the petro? Word
I'm trying not to hit my 6's on the curb
Nothing like Sonny but I'm driving in reverse
In love with the money, I shall never deter
Probably with the honeys on 54th and 1st
My pimp hand strong from Cali to dirty Jers
Church, tabernacle
Look at ya bird, she laughing at you
Shit is absurd, what happen after you niggas walk out the club?
Them goons start clappin' at you
Sometime short days can turn into long nights
Steve Urkel niggas trying to life Capone life
You seen Menace, don't get caught up at the wrong light
Shooting K's and handguns got a long flight
Yeah, got the lights on backyard looking like Vegas
When the fights on
Hood morning, Hood evening, Hood afternoon for no reason
Buck 50 to the face now you bleeding
Think he Leonidas, 300 while he cheesing
Hop in that 300, tell my niggas we leaving
Tell that nigga laying the ground, we even
No need for oxygen masks, he ain't breathing
Did it with the lights on, Compton raised a heathen
Ain't no fucking witnesses, but everybody seen it
They know what the business is, I'm ripping up subpoenas
Got no love for bitches, all I'm giving them is penis
Got to watch these bitches, they'll take you to the cleaners
They'll starch that ass, they'll press ya
Trying to be Kobe wife, bitch you ain't Vanessa
Bitch you ain't Monica, so what's with all the pressure?
I'm rolling my chronic up, 
bling on the dresser
Out in Santa Monica banging her on the dresser
I don't do the cuffs, but she wan't me to arrest her
Take another pump then switch the direction
Walk around dolo, I don't need protection
Unless I'm with a groupie, now I need protection
Four condoms came for the thing, I'm on that next shit
Two word minimum, I ain't trying to text shit
Two drinks at Mr. Chow's, now we on some sex shit
Can't get through the door with this whore
She trying to success, she trying to succeed
She trying to blow me, no strings attached she like a Wii
But when the houselights come on she like a 3
Put her face in a bag, from behind she like Free
And I ain't have to buy the bitch a bag it was free
But that's just for me, give it to her like ""Unnhhh"" Master P
Ain't no limit, I go hard as motherfucker
Me and Pacquiao seeing stars like a motherfucker
384 Bars like a motherfucker
All out of breath I should pause like a motherfucker
Nah, I gotta go hard as a motherfucker
Drop top Gotti, foreign cars as a motherfucker
Started off small, living large as a motherfucker
In my rearview I came far as a motherfucker
Rip the head off Medusa and all the blood suckers
Peace to Baby and Slim, them my blood brothers
Shout out to Waka and Jones, them my blood brothers
Shout out to Styles and Kiss, them my other brothers
Shout out to Tune and Ross, them my other other brothers
Sitting here watching the throne, bored as motherfucker
(Lets go)
Time to break the beat down for these clowns
Tell my Uncle Otis he can RIP now
Go to sleep now, my flow senile
And I ain't trying to get locked up, in the penal
System
I can't feel my face, I'm trying to feel the bass
But I got all this Ace in my system
Run circles around you rap niggas
Like I'm doing drills for the Pistons
Sleep comfy but I can still, hear the whispers
Draw steel, 'cause niggas still don't get the picture
Gotta paint it red just so they can see it
If you can't understand colors, nigga Ice-T it
Now bring the bass back, turn up the sneer
Tell the bitches with lace fronts start fixing they hair
And Mars give a nigga a drumroll right here
And right there, yeah...
Back, back, back up on that rap shit
Keep that Louie napsack and that backpack shit
GTFOH, with that snapback shit
Fucking three bitches a night, call it a hat trick
Los Angeles, Kings meaning its more than one
Me and Snoop be doing our thing
And I kinda did away with the bling
Use to walk around every fucking day with the bling
In and out the fucking safe with the bling
Niggas come around they ain't safe with the bling
My shine is mine, catch a case for the bling
Out comes the 9 out the waist for the bling
Put this mother fucker in your face for the bling
Burn your tongue now you ain't got a taste for the bling
80 bars left, whole club sold out
And I'ma get this flow out until their ain't no fucking car left
Until there ain't a Cuban cigar left
See my nigga Dre in here, Yeah he on the far left
Long way from car theft, around the corner from homicide
If you seen the shit that I seen
You probably be traumatized
Remember when my brother died
Thats what made my mama cry
Spent four years alone then my grandmama died
Damn, I ain't never been the same
Pay homage to the woman that gave the world to Game
So the drama it will never die
That's on my mama five
Fuck with my kids or my wifey, that's when the llama fly
Can't afford to lose them
If I had to pick between hip hop or my family
Motherfucker, I'd choose them
As far as rap niggas, I break legs and bruise limbs
Stomp a nigga face in, in some huge Timbs
Niggas don't invite me to shit, I had to move in
Annihilated Bleek, had to tie a couple loose ends
Couple crashed cars, had to lose a few friends
Wifey want an Escalade, I just copped a new Benz
Fuck stock, hood niggas ride new rims
Dubs too small fuck it go on 22 then
22 shrinking now we on 24's
Won't be long til 6's sittin' on that Porsche
Niggas chopping Maybachs, clever, raw
But I'ma chop a Chevy, Mad Max the '64
Bitches love it, niggas like that
Hip Hop was high school punch, I had to spike that
Tell 'Bron and Wade the nigga Mike back
If Uncle Otis rubbed you wrong, go get the ice pack
Undisputed beef king, who the fuck could fight that?
You wanna hit the surplus store, then bring a knife back
Niggas goin' gold, ""shit them is nice plaques""
Finally, get your ass in the ring
Won't fucking fight back
Everybody wants you to swing, go ahead and strike back
Me I'm spitting nothing but flames
I'm like a strike match
Empire Strikes Back, Jedi Mind Tricks
This is how the stars war, why you acting hard for?
Me, I'm hardcore, middle of Darfur
You don't wanna see what the fuck is inside the car door
I got something big under the T-shirt
On the front it say ""Tha Carter IV""
I'm about to order more
Nigga they ain't told you?
It's like the Gulf War
Put a hole in one of you niggas, no par 4
'Rari on the green, got a V12 Ferrari on the green
I be twisting Bob Marley on the green
I took 100 thou just to add another Mazerati to the team
Should of saw me as a teen, facin' the magazine
Any drama, I'm loading up a case of the magazines
Not the Source or the XXL know what I mean?
Rolling Stone, ain't getting my Vibe
So I remain King
At least til T.I. home
As far as the East, ain't no King nigga B.I. gone
Far as bars that four ocho cinco
So the next line is for Ocho Cinco
Easy on the Clicqot, homie don't drink so
I'ma guzzle the bottle and find me a fucking sink yo
Where Otis? Somewhere playing Bingo
Star on my face,
 
I'm a star like Ringo
Ten bars left, su woo is the lingo
All red everything, no visine though
Just left Boston, no Benzino
Hit something out in New York, Bambino
And I coach my team like Pitino
He know, we hit King of Diamonds
Everybody throwing c-notes
On my way to Sin City, pit stopped in Reno
Feeling like Carlito before they casted Pacino
Matter fact fuck him, De Niro in Casino

Freedom,Jesus Piece,2012.0,"Holdin' my daughter in the booth
Her momma out there somewhere in that Bentley trynna find a roof
Poof, I wave my wand and here comes Kendrick
Niggas say the west ain't winnin', I'm just tryin' to find the proof
Speakin' of Proof, I'm 'bout to roll one with Snoop
Blow the smoke out to your memory and toast to Eminem
Cause he, gave me the shit that I needed on Documentary
Keep it real with myself, I got murdered like John Kennedy
But that was cool cause I was just there for the energy
Watchin' Bizarre pop pills while 2Pac in my hennessy
First time in Detroit, had to rock the Grant Hills
Cause I threw up my dukes when California was at a stand still
But hope ain't lost cause Dr. Dre the man still
Had faith in me, knew I had heat like an anvil
Ran through entire crews, put their remains in a landfill
And I ain't lost the hunger, I'm eatin' out the can still
Yeah, wherever Hov and Nas at in the world right now
I know they listenin' like
This young nigga be killin' this shit
Hip-hop is life's Cîroc I'm 'bout to drop a pill in this shit
Let's go, esco bars nigga, like Nas nigga
The flow is Rakim with the Birdman cars nigga
Hold on I gotta take Birdman's call nigga

Stunna, whattup blood?
""Whattup blood? What's poppin' my nigga?

New coupe, remove roof
I'm from where niggas'll do your bitch and bitch niggas'll do you
Inevitably we take celebrity bitches and run a chu-chu
We puttin' on magnums, taggin' that wagon, some of these birds kookoo
And murder is what I do to
These Just Blazes, Kanyes, shit on Swizz, I handle my biz
The whole world know what I do to Dre's shit
Niggas know I'm classic, I ain't even gotta say shit
Frank Ocean more of a man than you niggas, get up off that gay shit
Fuck copyin' styles, niggas be tracin'
Whether it's me, the movie, or Jadakiss, niggas just can't fuck with Jayceon
Let's go

Laa, da da da dup da ah
Thought you love me before
I'm glad to kill it some more
Every hood needs an anthem
Laa, da da da dup da ah
Winning comes with a price
No matter how hard you try
Can't buy freedom
We're far from being free
Yea we're far from being free
We're far from free

Wanna welcome everybody to Jesus Piece
After my album fades, my competition will lyrically be deceased
Niggas saying I'm underrated
Like a younger Jay with heat, but not the ones the Thunder play with
So Los Angeles King is sort of an understatement
Let me find a gun to play with, I leave you niggas under pavement
Tell 'em they rent's due, pay up or get cement shoes
All this dope be around, you act like I ain't lean on that fence too
But now you up here and bitches and cars is what I'm into
You wanna send me to God, I wear 45 in that French shoe
I fuck with Wale, Ross, and my nigga French too
And me and Face just slashed the last beat up like a ginsu
My album like a 'Rari, a lot of dope features
Glad you bought it, now sit back and just blow reefer
I know the concept behind it is gon' reach ya
Now turn this motherfucker up and blow speakers
Ladies and gentleman
I would like to introduce to you
An incredible gentleman
He goes by the name Elijah Blake
Let's go

Laa, da da da dup da ah
Thought you love me before
I'm glad to kill it some more
Every hood needs an anthem
Laa, da da da dup da ah
Winning comes with a price
No matter how hard you try
Can't buy freedom
We're far from being free
Yea we're far from being free
We're far from free

And last but definitely not least
I wanna send a special shout out, to my nigga James Harden
Another Los Angeles nigga carrying rockets
Ballin' on you bitches

Ay man, look
You done rocked with my nigga Game
First of all Game, shouts out to you
You put your foot in this album's ass
Here's the thing man
This is your public service announcement for free
This is from me, to you, and everybody who listens to this album
At the end of the day, man, you can't be judged
If you a man to God, then be a man to God
If you a nigga from the streets, god damnit, be a nigga from the fucking streets
At the end of the day, you are who you are
God made you for a reason, man
Now I'm not saying go kill nobody
I ain't saying go smack ya lady in the face
What I'm saying is, be who you think you are, man
Don't mix that shit up
At the end of the day, look
Am I perfect? No
Do I want to be perfect? No
Does God know I'm not perfect?
Well that's a fucking question mark, cause here's the thing man
Cuz I'm praying at the wrong times of the day
That's weird, and I'll talk to you about that later
But man bottom line what I'm saying is this dude
Be you do you, can't nobody judge you but you
And at the end of the day if you doing hat you supposed to
Then fuck it man!
You got one life! Live it!

Searchin' for a pot of gold like a leprechaun

And I just lost a best friend for the second time
Now I'm on a quest to find peace
Still gotta carry my piece and, ""Soo Woo!"" when it's reppin' time

And everybody doin' time, stay headstrong
You still got a chance to live even though you dead wrong

Gang Bang Anyway,The Documentary 2.5,2015.0,"Um, yeah
Palms sweatin' guess it's time for the murder
My nigga my nerve, I swerve left you dead on the curb
Tell his family get them black clothes
Any witness gets a 9 cold, could do this with a blindfold
I'm that player on the corner lookin' dry when it rains
Pimp a dollar out a pussy, I ain't tryin' to change
Far from average
, 
I'm smokin' this cabbage
Bottled teeth, joint Karats, say cheese, make the cops freeze
Big cribs, for bars, livin' by the dreams
You only gangsta through your bop screen
My set the reason for the Crime scene, fill up the city with madness
We the reason the hearses left your hood and holdin' up traffic
Let the riddles do the scrappin', keep the gun in my fabric
Better pistol than them badges, you get dealt with the maggots
Heard drive-bys everyday, seen homies die early age
Though we still gang bang anyway
Uh, yeah, Figg side

Though we still gang bang anyway, uh
Though we still gang bang anyway, uh
Though we still gang bang anyway, uh
Though we still gang bang anyway

B's and them H's

tats on faces
Glocks with extendos, chuckin' up the hood
Then throw like 80 out that window 
the chopper make you limbo
Gotta keep them antennas up, moving down Central
Young niggas with skinnies, moving with them semis
Catch your ass leavin' the club, murk you at Denny's
Squeeze till it's empty, it seems so unreal
'Till the Gunfire got you using tables as a shield
East side, west side, niggas getting chastised
Droppin' like fruit flies, we all know who died
We all go on Insta and get the whole rundown
A 15 second clip until he put the gun down
Know OGs who took more shots like diabetics
Had that MAC paint on your face like cosmetics
Chucking up big ass Bs is my fetish
Type of shit that make you go brazy if I let it
Niggas got zippers, wheelchairs and prosthetics

Hundred days, hundred nights, nigga
Let the K scream till we see the red and blue lights, nigga
From the Hoovers to the Hundreds, nigga
From Kelly Park to Bounty Hunters, nigga (Watch out for the shooters)
Same age as the kids in Iraq now
LA Chiraq now, funerals is packed now
Preachers at the pulpit, Jesus is the background
Grandmother get shot walking out the church, how that sound?
Niggas don't really like it but we grew up in it
City of angels, belly of the beast get chewed up in it
Started as Black Panthers, everything power, everything pro black
Started off unified, the FBI know that
A little coke sprinkled on tables but wasn't no crack
False imprisonment, Huey P, Geronimo Pratt
Now close your eyes, listen to me, your mind'll go back
Picture us chained together under the boat, that's a Kodak
And since today is Thursday, let me hit you with a throwback
Stolen identities, God left us here without LoJack
Forced to find ourselves, forced to break up outta chains
Got tired of getting hanged so we started our own gangs
Tookie Williams (Crip), Sylvester Scott(Blood)
Seventy two Lil' Country caught a slug
And that was the first time a crip ever killed a blood
Now the shit is worldwide cause it is what it was
We know the history and we know the shit could end any day

Though we still gang bang anyway, uh
Crips, primarily African American gang
Though we still gang bang anyway, uh
Founded in Los Angeles, California 1969
By Raymond Washington and Stanley Williams
Though we still gang bang anyway
Today there's over a million Crip members worldwide
Associated with the blue bandana
Bloods, also primarily African American
Street gang founded in Los Angeles county city known as Compton
By Sylvester Scott and Benson Owens
A mission he formed to provide members protection from the Crips
Today there's over 5 million Bloods worldwide
The government still can't contain us
And our fate was sealed forever
When 17 year old LA brim Frederick ""Lil Country"" Garrett
Was murdered by west side Crips on June 5th, 1972

Crip 1: Hey man ain't that Lil Country over there cuz?
Crip 2: If it is, his ass gon' be laying in a blood river
Crip 1: Hey man, make a u-turn and pull up on him real slow
Crip 2: Alright cuz
Crip 1: What's happening Fred?
Shotgun pump and gunshot
Woman: Frederick, oh my god, oh my god Frederick no, no
Gasping for air

But if you put that pussy right up in my face, I remember
Drop that pussy down on the floor, I remember
The way she comin' down on the pole, I remember)

Pop the pussy, don’t play with it
I don’t care if Kanye hit it, I don’t care if Jay hit it
I’mma eat it up and I’mma lay with it
We shot a chopper at the gun range
Got stupid cars, got dumb change
Red bottoms, let the tongue hang
Got an off-white Porsche, cum stain
I’m whippin’ work (I remember)
Roll up that purp (I remember)
Pour up that syrup (I don’t remember)
(How Tunechi had that purple Slushy comin’ out that blender)
Got a Keisha, got a Rhonda
Got a Nisha, got a Tanya
Got a Tishaun and a Honda
And I eat her anaconda
Got condoms in that condo
Got kush greener than Rondo
Still hit me up for that blow

Drop top ‘Rari shit, I drove it like I stole it
The Lambo' in the shop, told my bitch to Range Rove
Microwave broke, so a nigga had to stove it
Dropped it off to my Auntie, told her hold it
I’m posted right now, posted in this Gucci link
87 did 30 mil', wonder what Coogi think
Quarters, 9 1/2 sold  (I remember)
Yeah, it’s the middle of June, and it’s snowing like December
If you get into the ‘sac in your hood, I could mend ya’
Ya’ nigga talking reckless on your song, I’ll revenge ya’
Pull up to the club in a Phantom, I had a vision
Break ‘em all down, Arm and Hammer in the vision

It’s been a long damn time since a nigga sold dope
But if you put a brick right in front of me, I remember
Bakin’ soda and the triple beam, I remember

The way she comin' down on the pole, I remember)

Pop that pussy up in that hydraulics (what’s that)
Six fo', throw that brick inside a pot and cook it, whip it good though
Baking soda inside of her bowl, hey yo, watch me blow
Promethazine mixed with a Sprite, pour a fo'
Been sipping syrup all night, and I get higher than a plane 
(Pluto)
Yeah, I remember your pussy, girl, but I don’t know your name
I got diamonds hanging off if they could talk it'd be insane
Ever since I gave her that molly, man that girl ain’t been the same
Better pop the pussy for a real nigga
That’s on the way, I’mma deal with ya
I’m a real boss, that real sauce
Don’t try me bitch, I will floss
That’s real talk, my top off, I’m throwed off
I'm on that green, don't play golf (chronic)
I hustle take no days off

Why your girl pullin' on my hookah
Money stretch like Kama Sutra
Started with the roosters
Then I start spittin' clean the money like a loofah
6'5, tall like a hooper, ball like a hooper on the floor like a hooper
So I must be Clay with the .38, Thompson with the Thompson
Everything about me Compton—I mean—everything about me Bompton
I ain't never had shit, I grew up like Magic Johnson

I taught myself how to spit from listening to 
It Was Written
My first bars wasn't dope but I had that in the kitchen
Suge wouldn't listen, Irv wouldn't listen
So I ran around with Diddy, Aftermath in the Mission
I would never ask another man for permission I do me
Fuck the Illuminati, I'd rather ride around in hoopties
But now it's the Ghost, my gold Ds is two threes
Still hop in the freestyle,
 
kick it like two Bruce Lee's
Cut open the noose leaves
Foreign on the hill like it's Lauryn
Smoking la la like the Fugees
Thinking to myself, is it God or Lucy?
Prada or Gucci, popping Cris', Rihanna, Karrueche
Homie I ain't gotta gas I'm so ahead of you fags
The shit I spit off Premo tracks burn confederate flags
Take the roof off roof

gimme Proof back and 2Pac
Westside, but you already knew that

I've been rapping for 12 years, 6 months, 16 days
Now I'm a veteran, spit a 16 sixteen ways
Sixteen in a clip, spit it 16 ways
I know six teens, pull up to a sweet sixteen and spray
I'm like sixteen Jay's but the beat I can manage
So every sweet 16 is like Duke and Kansas
You bout to lose advantage, I will come through crews and bandits
Bruise and damage, fuck you rules and manners
I kick back, click clack, bump the Wu in Phantoms
Fuck rap, I only respect Ja Rule and Hammer
Maybe the old Em, I'm Slim and I'm shady
Maybe the old him or Rakim
You niggas keep bullshittin' like Joakim
You so him, I'm so not, you so bitch, I sold rock
My four-four cocked, 
I been a Top Dawg, I know Dot
Back in '06 I pulled up in that gold drop
Five million sold livin' in the dope spot

Check it out, man, I go by the world-famous DJ Clue, desert storm, shoutout to my nigga, Game. When I first came to the West Coast, and me and Game hit the studio up, and he rapped for me, I knew he had all the key ingredients to become a legendary rapper
Here's DJ Envy from that Breakfast Club—I remember the first time hearing The Game, I just knew he was gonna be one of them niggas, one of them legendary niggas. That boy Game, he's a problem, I got my money on it
Funk Flex, baby! I dropped the bomb on every one of them joints off

The Purge,Blood Moon: Year of the Wolf,2014.0,"We are dying, we are dying
Are we gonna die? Are we gonna die?
We are dying

Light a blunt, throw on Nas, collect my thoughts
Blow the candles out as I contemplate in the dark
Dumpin' ashes on the fuckin' Time magazine
Tryna burn a hole between Israel and Palestine
All this world news, all these dead bodies
All these kids dying, the talk of illuminati
As I'm murderin' ink, I get a call from Irv Gotti
Say ""Keep spittin' cause when you do it's like a 12-gauge shotty""
Got machetes and them cannons loaded up
Got them Xany's and that lean in my cup
These politician's can come up missin', I'm on a mission
You hear them gun shots, now mother fuckers listenin'
Feel that you can take their life cause they ain't got a pot to piss in
Raise the Christian, kill you for these kids as victims
Fuck the system
You give a kid 30 cent and think you sponsor somethin'?
I feed a village by myself nigga Compton comin'
Purge

We are dying, we are dying
(Sometimes I wanna purge)
We are dying
(Sometimes I wanna purge)
We are dying, some times I gotta purge
(Sometimes I wanna)
We're living on a purge
(Sometimes I wanna)

What if we ran through Beverley Hills, got 70 kills
Ridin' down Rodeo in the Chevy with pills
And pop one, load 12 slugs in the eagle
And shot one, Donald Sterling hopped in his Benz
I got one, beam on the back of his dome
Palm sweaty on the back of the chrome
That's my adrenaline
So we purge Sandusky, purge Zimmerman
Purge every mother fucker rapin' women in
Purge niggas killin' kids, back to back in two vans
Me and my mercenaries, middle of South Sudan
Carryin' babies bodies, long as I got two hands
Long as I got two feet, millions and my crew deep
We purge for the families, they deaths ain't in vein now
Crash my ass, niggas know who shot that plane down
Two hundred and ninety eight innocent lives severed
Flyin' on Aaliyah's wings all the way to heaven
And so we Purge

We are dying, we are dying
(Sometimes I wanna purge)
(Sometimes I wanna purge)
We are dying, some times
(Sometimes I wanna)
We are dying
(Sometimes I wanna purge)

Imagine going to the stores without cops harrasing
Imagine Mike Brown walkin', them same cops just passed 'em
I'm smokin' hash, and let me ash it before I talk in past tense
I hope his mama tears is like acid to your fuckin badges
2 shots in his brain, 4 in his fashion
Thinkin' 'bout his casket in this Phantom, swear I almost crashed it
That's why I'm headed to Ferguson with this German ruger
Cause I'm probably more like Nelson Mandela than Martin Luther
More like Ice T than Ice Cube, I'm a cop killer
Murder all the cops, then the cops will probably stop killin'
On my knees prayin', wish my nigga Pac was livin'
But he fell victim to the Rampart Division, purge
Cops killed Biggie, cops beat up Rodney King
We tore up the city nigga, purge
Or just stand there like J. Cole
And shoot at cops in the same spot till the case closed, purge

We are dying, we are dying
(Sometimes I wanna purge)
(Sometimes I wanna purge)
We are dying, some times
(Sometimes I wanna)
We are dying
(purge)

This song is dedicated
To my engineer Jus' wife
Carey Jean who passed away June 28th at 1.45 pm
To stomach cancer
2 days before my son Harlem's 11th birthday
Crazy how he mournin' his wife's death and I'm celebrating my son's life
I'll never understand death, shit
Sometimes it's a struggle to understand life, shit crazy
I'll never understand
Can't stop fightin' to survive though, but what we fightin' for when we eventually all die though, purge
Eventually we all victims of the purge
Us killers, what's keepin' us alive
It's a question nobody got the answer to
So PURGE!",https://genius.com/The-game-the-purge-lyrics

Who the fuck y'all thought was comin' after Young Buck?
Hip-Hop's worst nightmare
Mr. Gangsta Rap is back in black Nike Airs
You want war, we can settle it right here
I got a squad, E-V-E and Busta Rhymes yeah
Or you could give me ya bitch, her with the light hair
Sit her next to these yellow bottles, yeah right there
Matter fact I'll take you in the back
You in the hat, and you in the blue and the black
Let's have a gangsta party
Somebody lean over and tell Banks to order another case of 40's
Yo Doc give 'em a Coke with that
Wake up the West coast is back

Show you how that low rider bounce off the flo' - You ain't know?

Make the club R.O.C. without Timberland boots
First nigga to put 'draulics on a Bentley Coupe
You wanna pimp? I'll perm my shit up like Snoop (Ah, Westside)
""Chronic 2005"" muh'fucker
Put the purple in the dutch ""Let it Burn"" like Usher - girl
Drop down, do the eagle, fuck that
Real niggas just pull up they pants and lean back - girl

Drop me in the 4th quarter I'm fuckin up they money
I don't need SoundScan I'm doin my own numbers
When that Impala bounce you can see the chrome under
I got 'em in every color, yeah I'm a known stunner
When I hit a switch I get higher than long jumpers
Lowridin with a hood rat or a grown woman
I'll do anything - but I won't fuck Mariah
Even if she had Ashanti butt naked in bed
Cause she got a fo'head just like Tyra
I can say what the fuck I want
You thought Dre retired, left me a six-fo' and his Dayton wires?

Game’s Pain,LAX,2008.0,"Aye, yeah
Yeah
Hey, yeah

See ever since the day I've got the chance to make a change
I've been in this game, it's a new day
And I'm makin it known cause, I just want the world to know
I'm payin my dues, and I got the utmost, I just wanna let you know
I'm payin homage cause, you've paved the way for me, ye-yeah

I swear to God, it feel like every day is my birthday
Let the top down, California's my birthplace
So I'mma take you there like B.I.G took niggas to New York
""Juicy"" had us feelin like we was from New York
And that's real shit, blazed the Philly
It's ""Summertime"", shout out to Will Smith
Cause who didn't wanna be the Fresh Prince?
Flat top, gold chain and some fresh kicks
My nigga Nas told me ""Money Make the World go Round""
And Uncle Luke showed me how to make my girl go down
I've been around Hip Hop since '85
She had her ups and downs but she stayed alive
I used to think LL stood for ""Love LA""
He from Queens, how the fuck he put that with Cool J?
Red Kangol hat, red sweatsuit to match
Red Adidas, nigga, Game is back

See ever since the day I've got the chance to make a change
I've been in this game, it's a new day
And I'm makin it known cause, I just want the world to know
I'm payin my dues, and I got the utmost, I just wanna let you know
I'm payin homage cause, you've paved the way for me, ye-yeah

Public Enemy and N.W.A
Is all my boombox had to say
""Today was a Good Day"" had the hood buzzin
Ice Cube my favorite rapper, y'all niggas can't tell me nothing
Everybody first bootleg was ""Boyz N the Hood""
Whoever thought gangsta rap would make noise in the hood?
When the cars ride by with the ""Boomin' System""
Two door Mustang, and the roof was missin'
Every girl at your school had the new extensions
Even gangstas was dancin' like New Edition
Cause the house parties stayed rockin all night
Niggas came through and shot it up but it was alright (alright)
Cause after the cops left, it was a party then
You down with O.P.P.? Then bring Naughty in
They say ""It Never Rain in Southern California"", Tony! Toni! lied
Sit back, watch Game throw his money in the sky

See ever since the day I've got the chance to make a change
I've been in this game, it's a new day
And I'm makin it known cause, I just want the world to know
I'm payin my dues, and I got the utmost, I just wanna let you know
I'm payin homage cause, you've paved the way for me, ye-yeah

Cash Rules Everything Around Me, C.R.E.A.M get the money
In the back, I relax with all the hunnies
DJ bring it back, let it go
Mix it in with Black Rob, make 'em say ""WHOA!""
Everything full circle, Game livin' major
Girls on my hip like a Skytel pager
Now I'm on the top, let the champagne pop
Throw ya hands in the sky cause The Game don't stop
Just a little more change, gotta Benz and the Range
Every rap metaphor always ends in my name
The Kool Hercs, DJ Red Alerts
Before I was born they was talkin 'bout The Game
Ask a Jay-Z fan 'bout Big Daddy Kane
Don't know him, Game gonna show 'em
Just like they showed me, my lyrics is O.G
When it's all said and done, you niggas gon' quote me

See ever since the day I've got the chance to make a change
I've been in this game, it's a new day

Blood Diamonds,Jesus Piece,2012.0,"Jacob sold me my first couple pieces
I was killing niggas who misunderstood what diseased is
Spent half a mill on a Ferrari, I coulda leased it
Driving Scott Storch's Bugatti 'fore they released it
Drop The Documentary, rockin' khakis with creases
Dope and hip-hop, it resurfaced with some leeches
Ten times platinum, now I'm chillin', where the beach is?
Time to show the world, what a motherfuckin' beast is
Blanca, bulletproof cars in Sri Lanka
Twelve years old, on his shoulder, a rocket launcher
Ten thousand miles away, there's an owner of a corner store
A white man walks in, spit shinin' his Audemars
While somewhere in Africa, Jo-Burg and Congo is goin' to war
Rebels enslavin' they own people, diggin' water or
Get murdered 'cause that choppa is a carnivore
He found one and stole it, now the village tryna find that boy

Blood diamonds
Look at blood diamonds
Blood diamonds
Now take a look at blood diamonds
Blood diamonds
Look at blood diamonds
Blood diamonds
Now take a look at blood diamonds

How you sellin' the shit our people is diggin' for?
Diamonds, cotton, that belong to niggas though
LeBron and Durantula gave America a look at gold
And what you give us back, is another fucking liquor store
And we need blunts, so we walk in that motherfucker
Money in the safe, so we in that motherfucker
But you can't forget the tape, tryna pin a motherfucker
DA ain't got a case, I'ma win that mothercuker
And it ain’t about the Chinese, dude, I eat Chinese food
Where you think Michael Jordan find these shoes
We robbin’ each other for 'em, think I should hide these jewels
Run up on you in broad day with them Siamese tools
But nah, Mandela did twenty-eight straight
Without a fucking complaint, put an afro on a Saint
Put a wig on a judge, put a nigga in some chains
Over change, kill him, lethal injection inside his veins

Blood diamonds
Look at blood diamonds
Blood diamonds
Now take a look at blood diamonds

Brutus killed Ceasar and Judas killed Jesus
John Wilkes Boothe killed Lincoln and you thought he freed slaves
What the fuck was you thinkin'? Nigga fuck Lincoln
I’m rolling up kush in my Lincoln, now let it sink in
Rolled against Obama now you divin' in the deep end
I’d rather take my chances at this water fountain drinkin'
Where the fuck is the loyalty, knock these niggas fuckin’ teeth in?
In the hood singin' like they Aubrey or The Weeknd
Pull that towel from under that door, and let it seep in
There's a lot of shit I don’t like, so bring Chief Keef in
I don’t like these phony ass jewelers with that fake shit
Overcharging niggas an arm and leg, just to make shit
And you wonder why we take shit, y'all put us on slave ships
That’s the reason we hate shit, rob our own niggas for them

I ain't gon' jump though, I'mma keep it raw gutter
Yo Prodigy, you know I need you on this one nigga

I got shit on my chest, I must confess
Last night I was the nigga that shot up your projects
Now I'm back in the hood, with rocks in the Pyrex
Tan khakis and them Nike Airs with the dyed checks
I was forced to live this life, forced to bust my chrome
My pops left me in a foster home
I felt abandoned like Quik now that Mausberg gone
So I don't hop in the SS without the Mossberg homes
I've been rappin' for a year and a half, my life is real
Put the gun in his mouth, he gon' bite the steel
Come to Compton, I got stripes for real
Before Dre, before the ice, before the deal - I was almost killed
Like 'Pac before the Death Row deal
I got shot over two pounds of weed, still ain't found them niggas
But karma come quicker for a nigga on the other side of the gun
That's somethin I gotta teach my son

I don't need your love, no no no no
I don't need your love
Need it, I don't want it, I don't need it
I don't need your love, no I don't need your love
I don't need your love
Cause, the, game, don't, change

I heard they got Bloods in New York now
Red rags in Uptown Harlem now, I need that love
Front court at the Knicks game, new chick, French name
New car, new house, and sometimes friends change
And you don't need that love, when you G's like us
And your Jesus piece is sim-u-lar to Biggie's
And your life story is sim-u-lar to 50's
First they hate you, then they love you, then they hate you again
What the fuck do it take for a gangsta to win?
No mics, no Unsigned Hype, nigga fuck 
The Source
Plus them awards I don't need
And them niggas breathing the same air as me, acting like they don't bleed
We don't drive the same speed, this a Continental T
That's a case of Armadale, this a continental suite
So I'mma drown in my own sorrows
Live life, fuck tomorrow, nigga 'cause reality is

I was gassed up, 
Murder Inc.
, Roc-A-Fella passed up
Sat in Daddy's House with Black Rob and Lou and asked Puff
Now The Game's set in stone, the Franck Muller's set in stones
Dre cut me a check, I'm gone
Tryin' to be the king of the streets, niggas'll wet your throne
But I got nieces to feed, two coasts to please
So I roam through the city like the ghost of E
Gotta put Compton back where it's 'sposed to be
Nuthin' between all my niggas that's close to me
In the streets with two fellas packin' toast for me
I'm 'posed to be, got all the critics watchin' my pivot
On my block in the Coupe readin' kites from prison
I got niggas doing life in prison
All my fallen soldiers is one of the reasons we pour out liquor
So this song is for Ms. Wallace, Afeni Shakur

Til' one weekend my uncle got stabbed to death
He got murdered by a fiend, my pops ain't like that
He was from Nutty Blocc, they used to call him Maniac
Crazy ass nigga, with a Black Panther tat'
Kill a nigga, cross him out on his Compton hat

It's blood in, blood out, and ain't no turnin' back

I was the first nigga with a Starter jacket on the block
Used to build model cars and make them motherfuckers hop
Moms banged Hoover Crip, she was known for sellin' rocks
Let me collect the 40 ounce bottles in the dope spot
Bought my first Converse, thought I couldn't be stopped
When I creased up my khakis and threw on my Ronnie Lott
Used to think that I was hard, so I stole my brother's Glock
And that's the day my life changed, 'cause that night he got shot
Killed by another Crip over his Rolex watch
I got high for three years off that ""Chronic"" from the Doc
I was drinkin' 40 ounces a lot
And every liquor store in Compton sold out the day Eazy dropped
I start bangin' red laces in my A-di-das
Drinkin' out a brown paper bag on my first drive-by
I was a menace to society

I got a lot of dead homies, some Blood some Crip
This is life, stop watchin' that ""Boyz N The Hood"" shit
You see this red rag hangin' outta my jeans
I went to 20 funerals by the age of 19
Then I went to college, basketball was my dream
Quit the team, 'cause I'd rather shoot rock with the fiends
Wanted to be Freeway Rick
He showed me how to turn a stolen 5.0 into a brick
Bought a Cadillac, thought I was rich, bangin' DJ Quik
On Crenshaw got jacked for my shit
Took a long chronic hit, and thought about the time
When I was 12 years old and I emptied my first clip
Hit my first switch, same night fucked my first bitch
Thought I was dreamin 'til I pinched her tits
She caught a stray bullet ridin' shotgun in my shit

Better Days,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Been holding this pain inside for so long
Though the rain never goes away
They say I should leave these streets behind me
But it's so hard to escape
Oh Lord please send me an angel
To lead me out of this place
Take me away, away
Far away, to better days

First thing I wanna do is say ""What up"" to T.I
King of the south, now everybody see why
I'm just driving and thinking how I survived here
And I ain't seen Dre and Eminem in five years
That sound Shady right, I live a crazy life
So many black thoughts I had to paint the Mercedes white
I could tell you 'bout the rims, but I ain't here for that
Going out like Big and Pac, I fear for that
Take this Lambo, and put six holes in it
Shut up the glass and leave my body exposed in it
Lift the doors up and let all of my demons out
And I can see my brother now cause that's what I've been dreamin 'bout
I ain't thinkin 'bout bitches or pulling Beamers out
I'm thinkin 'bout my sons' safety everytime they leave the house
I know how to make it out the hood, I seen the route
And here's the proof, me, Venus and Serena out


I'm sittin on these stairs at this church, 'bout to start a verse
And somewhere in the world, somebody 'bout to start a hearse
Tell me who inside it, Who's son is that
And how he get there, now tell me who gun was that
I ain't saying confess, definitely ain't saying snitch
But if you killed the nigga, help his mama dig his ditch
I'm from a hood where niggas gotta keep they gun cocked
And kids wear Dre Beats to stop the sound of gun shots
But at least they got the Dre Beats
Cause kids in Africa ain't even got shoes on they feet
And I seen it with my own eyes
At the same time I'm picking flies off my own eyes
Can you feel that, If you can hear 'em buzzin
You can feel the pain of Mike Tyson and his baby mother
They lost they baby daughter, and she was only three
She never got a chance to blossom on the family tree

Verse 3: The Game]
We got a new president and I love that he black
But I'mma ask him like Bush ""Where the soldiers at?""
Now move the camera to New Orleans ""Where the soldiers at?""
The water dried up, well nigga do the Nolia clap
We all juveniles, we all been through some trials
And some tribulations, I'm in this booth pacin'
What do I say next, should I talk about some cars?
Or the next chapter of my life and show you all my scars
All my bullet wounds and my stab wounds
I can't show you, I covered 'em up with tattoos
I can't do nothing but spit the truth
On probation, smoke and drink Patron before I hit the booth
You makin' songs for the club, when niggas drinking
I make 'em for the ride home, when niggas thinking
One minute you here, next minute shit is tragic
And this a Jim Jonsin track, now feel the static",https://genius.com/The-game-better-days-lyrics

'Til the motherfucker bounce and break
And knock both of the screws out the licence plate
Let the games begin
These other rap niggas so far behind me could taste my rims
Shit, let the chronic burn as the Daytons spin
It ain’t been this much drama since I first heard Eminem
In the club, poppin' X pills like M&Ms
Call it Dre day, we celebratin', bitch bring a friend
Bottles on me, tell the waiter to order another round
And put that cheap-ass Hypnotic down (Put your ‘cris up!)
If you feel the same way
Who got 'em hittin' switches NY to LA

Hop in the low-rider, long as you got bitches in the back

Call it a lap-dance, when the six-fo' bounce that ass

Take a picture with him, then you gotta fuck me
And you gotta fuck Busta, can’t touch Eve
Got somethin' in my waist that you can’t touch either
That’s, my gangsta bitch, and like Crips and Bloods
I’m in the club on some gangsta shit (So nigga twist up)
Light another dub
Bitches get scared when niggas start fightin' in the club
Ain’t nothin' but a g-thing, baby it’s a g-thing
Bounce like you got hydraulics in your g-string

Help me! Help me! Somebody, help me!

Blood of a slave, heart of a giant
Had to leave Aftermath, Dre said I was too defiant
That was five years ago, look how fast it go
Destroyin' Interscope, shot myself like Plaxico
But fuck that, blaze one, where the matches, yo?
Hit the freeway and see how fast the Aston go
Roll the window down, clip off the ashes so
You can see all my diamonds and how much cash I blow
How many bitches I fuck, how many cars I drive
How many goons I got, count 'em and they all outside
Niggas try to shut me up like Malcom
But standin' in the window K smokin' was the outcome
Sometimes I get a little stressed and pop a Valium
Hit Hollywood late night and knock down a stallion
So niggas think twice 'bout my medallion or
You'll hear Cuba Gooding yelling ""Ricky!""
My nostalgia is a hunnid percent Compton, zero percent snitch
Park a Bentley and the Phantom on blocks where I used to pitch
Made the Cincinnati fitted more famous than Griffey did
And just to think, several years ago they tried to split his wig
Two to the chest, struck his heart, one hit his rib
Then I blacked out, like a movie, all I could hear

Come on, let's get 'em, let's get em
Get 'em, man, get 'em
Cut him off, pull right here, cut him off
Go, man, go

Feelin' all fucked up, woke up to a doctor
All I could think about was if the cops took my weed and my choppers
They want me to sing like Sinatra,
I told the detective get this clear like Belvedere vodka
Them five that shots then created a monster
Hell's Kitchen comin' straight out of Compton
I seen Boyz n the Hood, Morris Chestnut was a actor
2Pac was the real life ""Ricky!""
Then they shot down the nigga that shot him, swear to God
If I'm lying then Compton is New York and I'm Rakim
I'm from where niggas get murdered over stock rims
And punched in the jaw just for a cocked brim
Nobody mama let the cops in, we ain't got no options
Wanted to be a boxer, but I was boxed in
Then my grandmother house went up for auction
And that's what what killed her, I'm goin' back to buy the block then
Too many niggas locked in, dig up Cochran
And defend all my niggas ith they face under stockings
Rather face God than 25 with no options
If Compton ain't the murder capital, we in the top ten
Drive by with our face painted, like a clown
With a tre-pound, forty shells bouncin' off the ground

Last Time You Seen,The Documentary 2.5,2015.0,"When the last time you seen 2Pac?
When the last time you seen 2Pac?
When the last time you seen 2Pac?
When the last time you seen 2Pac?

I know who killed Pac, nigga
The police know who killed Pac, nigga
Suge Knight know who killed Pac, nigga
He died at the car wash, the world heard the shots, nigga
Then they killed Biggie, he just came through to visit
Rampart division, Pirus ain't had nothing to do with it
So many niggas in caskets, then turned ashes
Some get shot, some Hussein Fatal in car crashes
I think it's a conspiracy theory, Illuminati
How Pac died and two months later they killed Kadafi
Then they killed Buntry Al and Heron, they getting sloppy
LAPD, these niggas worse than the Nazis
And Pac was only 25, thuggin' as a youngin'
Sitting shotgun, I wonder if he seen them shots coming
Guess it don't matter, all the niggas buried, though
Wouldn't have never happened if Suge kept it real with Harry-O

""The way I look at it is like this, even me man, coming up in that game, right. I came up in that game, man, and I was blind to a lot of things. And even though I came to jail for some bullshit, I believe that the karma had a lot to do with that. See that's what happened with fat boy when he disrespected me in the game. But I was a good dude in a lot of ways to a lot of people and so a lot of people that crossed me in different ways think they gon' have karma. So karma swings for me both ways, what you put out you get back. You put out good shit, you gon' get good shit; it may not always look like it because sometimes there be obstacles in the between. But I done learned 'cause when I was on the street I used to go hard in the paint about different shit. What I learned over the years though is, man, sometimes you ain't gotta be the judge, the jury or the situation 'cause karma gonna handle it’s business 'cause it’s ""

Late night down Sunset, liking the scene
On a tour bus in St. Paul, riding to win
Don't know how it begin, every day was a new
When he was young, living life fast and rhyming his truth
And if crack had took a part of the homies family tree
The lil' nigga he was talking 'bout was probably me
And him to know my life story and we not even meet
When we did, it was like we'd known each other for dealing
When the last time I seen him? He was playing his tape
That he would later title Makaveli the Great
Smile for me, yeah, it's strictly for my niggas
Try to touch money, high on weed and liquor
Hoping God'll forgive us, we been stuck here in the Matrix
Dead before you dishonor a nigga when he face him
Whatever shit you dealing with, you get you two Glocks
I guarantee that pussy shit'll stop
When the last time you seen 2Pac?

When the last time you seen 2Pac?
When the last time you seen 2Pac?
When the last time you seen 2Pac?
When the last time you seen 2Pac?

Last time I seen him was in the mirror this morning

One Night,Doctor’s Advocate,2006.0,"I only fuck with you, on two occasions
When I'm drunk, when I'm high
I would be broke, if I would be with you
That is why it's fo' one night

I'm a motherfucking gangbanging nightmare, wake up motherfuckers
I traded in my white Nike Airs
For a red pair of Converse,
 back to the hood
My own niggas acting like I turned my back on the hood
I used my rap money to put crack in the hood
Even brought the nigga Dr. Dre back to the hood
I showed niggas the Bentley then let you drive it
Gone for two days and I ain't even check the mileage
When we was fighting with Crips it wasn't about no dollars
It was about selling dope to put our kids through college
I'm sitting on the block, reminiscing for hours
Wiping my tears cause now half of my niggas is cowards
And I was still fuckin with niggas
After I got shot and didn't get one hospital visit
My homey Snoop told me it'd be days like this
It hurt my heart, to say this shit


Red bandana in my back pocket, I'm for real
This ain't a pastel color khaki suit, and I ain't Pharrell
I don't front about shit I pull my gun up out shit
And let everything fly to keep my son up outta this
I thought you loved me nigga, talk is cheap
Remember, the bulletholes in my son's car seat
My baby momma found four shells
I ain't get one ""keep your head up,"" all I got was ""keep it real""
'Keep it real' my niggas?
Last year alone I spent one point five mill' on my niggas
After the bullshit, I stayed right there
Took you to award shows, there go Jay right there, where? Right there!
I had all you niggas in suits, cleaner than a pair of fresh Nike Airs
I'm supposed to enjoy this shit but it's quite clear
The last twelve months been a fucking nightmare


This shit worse than arguing with my bitch
I done been through mo' ups and downs, than the Impala switch
Get yo hand out my pocket nigga, go fish
I was born by myself so I don't owe y'all shit
Nigga you tell me, what you want me to do
Drop my son off at home and come bang wit'chu?
Oh now it's fuck Game, nah nigga fuck you
I put that on my life, matter fact, that's on Piru
And the reality is, I could die too
And end up in the cemetery, right beside you, we can both rot
Angels flying over my headstone, but the devils inside yo' box
You wanted my shine so I gave you ice
Then I gave you a second chance and you played me twice
Couldn't be a real homeboy to save yo' life
I shoulda took Dr. Dre's advice

Only fuck with you on two occasions
When I'm out of my mind, or when I'm high
I only, fuck with you...",https://genius.com/The-game-one-night-lyrics

Told your partner the same thing, man
How long a nigga gotta stay here? Raggedy-ass precinct

It was money on the table with the bricks
I was in the livin' room fillin' on this bitch
Heard my car alarm going off on my 6
So my dogs start barkin'
 and some niggas hit the fence
So I take my dick out this bitch mouth and walked to the window
Pulled the blinds down and took one hit of the Indo'
Them niggas ain't doing shit, but stealin' my neighbors rims so
Walked back to the couch and told the bitch to bend over
That's what I'm rollin' with...
Nah, I ain't seen shit and I ain't snitchin' on nobody
Yeah, that's my four-five, but it ain't got no bodies
Them two dead niggas? Them is nobody
They should have torched 'em, then you wouldn't had no bodies
I mean look at these pictures, shit is so sloppy
Couldn't have been me, I do my shit like John Gotti
Feed a nigga to the sharks after dark

Man, fuck this shit, I thought I told y'all
It was money on the table by the bricks
I was at the kitchen table choppin' up some shit
Listenin' to Jeezy and I heard a little (*bullet sound*)
So I turned the radio down and cocked my four-fif'
Oh shit... Am I hit? Nah, just a hole in my Jordan fit
So I turn down all the lights and cocked my four-fifth
Seen some niggas jump in they Escalade and that was it
How much longer I gotta stay in this mothafucka?
Let me get a cigarette, I don't even smoke
But shit, y'all got a nigga stressed
I gotta stay in this mothafucka 'til I confess?
Shit, y'all bitches better get some rest
'Cause it'll be a cold day in Miami
'Fore I snitch on myself or the 'hood, you understand me?
Yeah, I fuck with the Bulls but I ain't Sammy
Niggas runnin' 'round the 'hood singin' they should get a Grammy
And you two motherfuckas should get an Oscar
With this good-cop-bad-cop shit, take me to process
'Cause I don't eat breakfast with no pigs
I watched First 48 so fuck your 25 years
No evidence, no bid, I don't know who split them niggas' wigs

Already told y'all, it was money on the table with the bricks
I was walkin' to the bathroom to take a shit
Then I heard my dogs barkin', and some noise by the fence
So I ran to my room and reached for the four-fifth
Then I seen three niggas by my back door
Looked out the bathroom window and seen two more
So I reached for my chopper and some clips out the drawer
Guess I had to welcome niggas to the gun store",https://genius.com/The-game-the-good-the-bad-the-ugly-lyrics

See I stayed the same, ain't go weird like Lupe
Squeeze on this trigger like ain't no more toothpaste

Pardon my mannerisms

How the hell I did it? I let God ad lib it
I put that on Leetwood, I ain’t lying one sentence
Bitch, I started with a dollar and a dream
We went from helping old ladies with their groceries at Alpha Beta
For a  couple quarters to a baby hustling
Something major, we had to grow up sooner or later, but
I’m so Del Amo, my mama still stay off Anna Lee
Carson across my belly, I prove you lost already
Roccett my big brother, Bishop left the door crack
Game took me on my first tour, now look where we at
In the studio getting paid to reflect on that
Documenting true facts
Not to mention this the Documentary 2, too
You do the addition in ballerina shoes
Enough with the clever raps, it’s more important than that
I put my city on the map, nigga
Yeah, I really put my city on the map
I mean, when the last time you heard Carson on the track, nigga?
Let alone when they calling out stomping grounds on the West
I’ll wait...
Yeah, that’s what I thought, I’m the best, nigga
This the new West, nigga, respect that
It’s Top Dawg, all I’m missing is the red hat
But don’t question what pocket I had left, my handkerchief
I’m guilty by affiliation, in many ways gangsta
But let me explain something, a paradox if you may
I threw on my fresh Supreme Chuck Taylors today
And then I got a call from Chuck Taylor, I’m saying
The game ain’t changed, we still changing the game

My first album was a set up. I was the little nigga
Pac was talking to when he said ""keep your head up""
'Cause he knew what I would be facing after his demise
Jayceon had to pitch them pies, better life than flipping fries
I'm the one the Crips despise, move the Yay or kiss the sky
For having dreams that 50 died, Eulogy by Mary Blige
Hopped up in that enterprise, had to stop a genocide
Went from underdog to watching Top Dawg and Kendrick rise
Now tell me can I testify, pull over trying to rest for 5
On a block, no tint on the Wraith left these kids mesmerized
They ask me how I did it, how I got it, say I'm king you looking brolic
I put them weights down start practicing lyrical exercise
Tell me who the next to die, probably who the next in line
They got me battling ghost 'cause I'm the illest one alive
That's word to Pac, Pun, Biggie, why I stand as my city
If we was 'bout to run a train, you couldn't fuck with me
Ever since I saved my coast, it's been born again
If I ain't shit then who the king of California then?
Who could out-rap me?
Now think about if the same nigga you bout to say can run up and out-strap me
Yeah, out-trap me, yeah, out-gat me
I mean think about it, exactly
Speaking matter-of-factly I'm down playing that actually
Call me Game I ain't one still I get paid like an athlete
Do the math after the math, Doc two in the bag
Lived up to expectations, Dre took me first in the draft
Now who the fuck want what
Nobody survives so look alive when them Impalas in the cut

And for those hoes who go' make me cum
But them fuck niggas we don’t fuck with them
And fuck niggas gon' lose a lung
Knock knock nigga, come feel the drum

Hide the contraband in-between my gum

Well rocked up to a 8 year old
When it popped up, call it pot luck

Condos where it’s sun and trees

Nigga done been everywhere
Left trails in my city everywhere
But nowhere like home, C-O-M-P-T-O-N on
Bitch come and dust my throne
Stand from my grandmother’s porch to my executive Porsche
Now I’m driving through London and Rome
With a Parisian bitch, rockin corn rows
Backseat of my Panamera watchin' pornos
Where we goin? What we doin?
Fly to Johannesburg, leave the city in ruins
Then fly to Dubai on my poolside, coolin'
My Audemar ain't waterproof, fuck it, go and get a new one
I done been everywhere around the world and that’s cool
But can't no hotel fuckin' reserve us parked through
My hood, gorillas move whenever sharks move
Move back to Compton, shit, we ought to
Condos on Wilshire, shit I bought two
Livin' down the street where BIG got shot, I haunt you
And the very next day where Pac met his fate
It’s how we live our life, surrounded by tape

Where the angels fly, City of Angels
I, will, never let you down
Kill, anything approaching my crown
Still, undefeated
That’s why I got my kids building sand castles on the beaches
But don’t get it confused, city still got rules
Wear the wrong colors, nigga end up on the news
Lights out, like Durant in The Drew
Then I’m right back down Compton Avenue in a Buick
If you had a heart, niggas put a bullet through it
And it took a coma for you to be king, would you do it?
Would you do it?
If I dropped you off at Watts, would you walk through it?
Would you be from Grape Street or would you Piru it?

Nah, I ain’t Bloodin' nigga
Pass blunts to my cousins nigga
Turn hell into gold, I can pon the river
HiiiPower, you a Amish liver
Cali dro in my lungs and such
Twisting blunts from dawn to dusk
My shoebox should’ve been a armored truck
Everything good, feeling marvelous
Key to the city, they should honor us
You don’t talk me and Game, no game homie
Get greedy with the clip, no aim on it
Uh, and this the 3rd degree
Burn like the bridge and yo business, uh
Started at the floor, at the beginning, uh
Now I rep the floor until the ending, uh
Smoking on L's cause I’m winnin', uh
Wax getting blowed just to kindle it, uh
Yeah, now back to the groove, back to the Hooves
Rat-a-tat-tat in the 'Lac with a tool
No county jail, still wearin' all blue
Orange on the trim, straight lookin like Q

Got a bitch, say she wanna fuck in Beverly Hills
And I swear I’ma bring her to the set if she will
And if I do, the pussy better be killed
It's just the way I make her feel, no Stephanie Mills
A nigga heavily trill, these haters never be real
I came up in the 'Wood where it’s kill or be killed
I swear that every bitch I used to fuck fuckin' me still
Just give her dick, never covered a bill, this shit is real
This Westside INGLCL
Bands on them bitches, getting ends on them bitches
Gold framed Cartier lives on the bitches
Last long like I’m using extends on them bitches
I’m a (what?) native, I got real niggas with me
Golden State, gold grills, I put on for the Betty White
(Woop!) Middle fingers for the pigs
Tell them bitch niggas suck a dick, man come and get me aight

Workin' in secret Sunday, don't even wipe that pole
Dirty bitch, you done had a dick in every one of your holes
You a trick, you ain't shit and everybody knows

Let a nigga smash and you don't even wash your ass
Fuck you mean? You 'bout to go home and take a shower
That mean that pussy 'bout to be funky for a whole 'nother hour
Every night you let a new nigga nut in your shit
How you suck a nigga's dick with that cut on your lip?
You freak bitch, your baby daddy in the county doin' burpies
And you gave that nigga herpes

Bitch what? You fuckin' niggas when you got cramps
Talkin' bout eat these groceries, bitch you on food stamps
You gotta watch these hoes, they get your ass splattered homie
Never trust a bitch if she got the hood tattered on her
Brother, he a gunner, got an uncle from the hunnaz
Two baby daddies, one from the 60s and one from the Jungles
Make it even worse, her whole family's full of killers
After the funeral she right back to the followers and filters
She got a Range and a Benz
Doin' credit card schemes with her ratchet ass friends
Bitch just stole a TV from Target
Yellin' at her kids while Joseline and Stevie be arguin'
She blocked from Drizzy's page now she all on my dick

Heaven’s prays, all I’m wanna do, praise him, my lord

Nigga I ain’t pastor Mason yo
Nigga Pat and Ron, peach Ciroc, Ace and y’all
And since I got good taste and all
This for all the bad bitches couldn’t wait to get they braces off
I know we in church, and the way that I’m thinking wrong
But inside the bible is the perfect way to sneak my phone
But I don’t wanna do that, I came to take the service in
And stare at all the women who brought they Louis purses in
Bad bitches in here, forgive me for my sins
I ain’t meant to walk inside the church cursing again
I wanna live righteous and you know I love Jesus
But you can’t catch the holy ghost in the Prius


Lookin' 'round the church like what that nigga doing here
He prolly told on somebody, posed to be doing years
But who am I to judge a nigga
A.R. don’t wanna go to church, I can’t budge the nigga
But I love the nigga, so I’mma go for both us
And put these G Star slacks with these Louie loafers
He rather sit outside and listen to Hova
But the service jumping, the pastor serving my mimosas
And all this ass in here, how do I focus
Collection plate buldging, damn pastor you the coldest
My envelope stay swollen
So I’mma count my blessings now, somebody hold this

Staring in the row behind me, man these fat hoes is too cheap
Ain’t paying they tithes, taking up 2 seats
And look at God’s house, pack full of sinners
With the sun ride service, now they back for the dinners
Yeah I know the chicken good but your soul ain’t
And your outfit clean but your nose ain’t
And I suppose ain’t nobody a liar in here
If that was true, the whole chruch would be on fire in here
I’m sure glad we have a choir in here
To wake me up everytime I get tired in here
And one thing’s for sure, gotta praise the Lord

Been on songs with S-N-double-O-P
Inside a Ferrari with the D-R-E
Run up I let it sing like Nate D-O-double-G
Walk through 8 Mile, G-Unit's on my feet
Got a cherry lowrider in the N-Y-C
Eve took me to Philly, never been to the pen
Been to Uptown with 50, seen niggas in Timbs
I done seen Young Buck scuff Air Force Ones
In Cashville, but Compton is {where I'm from}
Where it's just me, my son, and my bitch
She graduated when Notorious BIG dropped ""Me & My Bitch""
She get them birds past, I put her in first class
And tell her to carry on that Dooney & Burke bag
She from Grape Street, she know how to work the mag
And only buy white tees, tell 'em to keep the purple tags
Cause the laces in my Chucks keep the beef crackin
I lay niggas out like creased khakis
In that G-wagon, lean like the 23's draggin
I got the whole N-Y-C saggin

What you thought cause I'm from Compton I couldn't do numbers like Usher?
Platinum certified, nigga that's a mill' plus
Play both sides of the fence cause the Crips feel cuz
See me ridin with Nate, nigga it's still Blood
You can C-walk to this, homey it's still love
Nigga I've been bangin since Mary J did ""Real Love""
(If you don't know) I painted the Rover black
The West coast is back, I can smoke to that
Moms got the CL-6, that's a fact
I bought the house, I'm just waitin on the platinum plaques

(No sleeping) 'til I cross the line, I'm running

With 99 miles left, on the Avis rental car
Blowing horns like Miles Davis
At the pearly gates, God let me in
Give me a room by Aaliyah's with ESPN
I know I got more sins than two lesbians
Been back and forth across the border like Mexicans
But (I'm running) like New York pedestrians
Trying not to scuff my Nike Air checks again
It's funny how niggas be the best of friends
And fall out over pussy and wanna dead they man
One of my niggas in the grave the other one in the pen
She fucking my enemies inside my homeboy's Benz
Now she begging God's mercy 'cause she ain't listen to Nas
And never heard about Ike with the Iverson jersey
He got a cousin named Jason that rock the Gary Payton
Now the same trifling bitch is a HIV patient, true story

If I catch a murder one, nigga, I'm running
Homicide come around and they keep on coming
That's why I'm out of state and I keep on running
I ain't Nelly, but my Desert Eagle's on, girl
Just dropped bail, traveling the world
When I sign my deal I said fuck jail
I went on tour to Barcelona and Brazil
This shit real, fuck an appeal
D's want my head like that bitch in 
Kill Bill
Sling dope sling crack and them E pills
That's why I'm on the low like a damn navy seal, I'm running

And Dre told me ain't no coming back from gold
So I gotta get my album in place
My G-Unit features, my Eminem sixteen, my Dr. Dre beats
And it was two years from today when I started rhyming
And took my demo to Suge and he ain't sign me
Niggas threatening my life 
like it's hard to find me
See me shining in the hood like twenty inch Lexanis
My mom said I'm hard head, I don't follow the rules
Why should I when Reebok giving niggas they own shoes
And I'm dealing with the same problems 50 Cent got
Yayo in jail and they think I'm trying to take his spot
I'm in the studio laughing at Chris Rock
Then I turn on MTV and see Soulja Slim shot
And niggas trying to gun me down in the rim shop
'Cause I just want the same recognition that the Crips got
They say I'm the next in line and if I get shot
Then I go out as the Bobby Fischer of hip hop
Make your chest move
Sylvia Rhone and Kevin Lyle slept cool
Jimmy Iovine was the best move

Fighting over two colors in the crayon box
It's no love, It's no love
40 ounces in my cup, I'm po'd up
We out here killin' each other, but so what?
Keep it up and there's gon' be no Crips and no Bloods
Nigga take a look around, the crack game has slowed up
The government versus the people, now tell me
Who rules the world with only one desire?
I don't believe there's anything higher
Rather get it now than to read about the outcome
I'd rather have the crown, than a ribbon or medallion
And oh my days, I guess it's okay
If I lay up in the shade when my rent is in the mattress
But be at the course if I have to use patience
I'm shootin' a premature dream in the napkin
Battlin' the evils in the flesh that I'm wrapped in
Waiting for my eagle, but the seagulls are distractin'

What's happenin', niggas?
What's happenin'?
What's happenin'?
What's happenin'?
What's happenin'? Yeah

What's happenin'? My nigga just died from AIDS
What's happenin'? ISIS throwin' grenades
What's happenin'? White boys shootin' up a church
What's happenin'? My nigga 2-2 just got some work
What's happenin'? You can get it if you got it, nigga
But I ain't got it, nigga, I'm just a solid nigga
Who run Compton, fuck bitches and flick Impala switches
Even if I was born blind, you niggas couldn't stop my vision
Right on time with mine thanks to them old Doc prescriptions
West side flourishin' again, this what 2Pac envisioned
Obama freeing lifers, that was locked in prison
El Chapo said he ran the world, and they forgot to listen
Not me, nigga, one split second, I say ""Fuck rap""
And if I ran into El Chapo, he had work as one his captains
And gave me 100 bricks and said ""'Migo, get it bracking""
I walk into a Mexican Mafia meeting like

What's happenin'? Pac's gone, Brenda's still got a baby
What's happenin'? Lost ones in the land of the crazy
What's happenin'? You can have a bad bitch in a Mercedes
But that don't make your basic ass Beyoncé or Jay-Z
What's happenin'? Obama 'bout to move out the White House
What's happenin'? Couple 'hood niggas 'bout to roll them dice out
What's happenin'? Is you gon' let me use your EBT card? (yeah)
I wonder if I could slide it for commissary, yah

Ain't it a shame?
Another lost one runnin' again
(You know I bust my thang for you)
You do the same old thing that your brothers did before you
Plannin' your whole life under concrete in the soil
Just a continuation, I wonder where you get your game from
If I know anythin' it's that my old head taught me all alone
And it's a cold game, better get your coat, get your snow chains, man
It's a chess game full of kings and pawns
Black and white squares, just depends what side you on
(What side is you on? What you want?
What you want? What you want?)
I want a red '64 Impala with them things on it

It's a black out inside an abandoned crack house
Only thing from last night was dead bodies and glass pipes
That was the age 4, and by the age 10
They opened up the caged doors and let the fuckin' beasts out
Fuck my auntie couch, I'm 'bout to take the street route
And get my shit the gangsta way, cause I can't be no Steve Stoute
I'm too Nas for these niggas, I got a surprise for these niggas
Potato cookin' on the barrel, I bring the fries to these niggas
Funeral hall, casket fit to the size of you niggas
Chrome 45, no lie, come say goodbye to you niggas
Sway got all the answers, Kanye lied to you niggas
I don't even wanna be in no top 5 with you niggas
I break ties with you niggas, then pay tithes for you niggas
Los Angeles king, I will no fly zone you niggas
Take a caravan and Impalas and drive to you niggas
Close one and aim, Fetty Wap's eye to you niggas

My money or my Glock, who do I trust more?
I don't know, it's probably the one that I touch more

And my Rolex racist cause it hate niggas

Have Asians in the kitchen cookin' in Louis V. aprons

Gotta hustle hard Ace, Tunechi and Ricky
Waves Frank Ocean? You could see my odd future
You gonna need more than Novacane after I shoot you
Yesterday I went to Coachella, not to see Jigga
I went to see Wiz, but there's Amber: perfect
I took a seat on the red futon
Hit it with that Wiz shit on - whatever
So put that pussy on my face
And let me taste a little taste
I'mma eat it up like it's my last

Where guns spark quicker, on fraud niggas
Them niggas better walk with you, take the long way home
My finger itchin' and this barrel so loooong
Like Pinocchio's nose my list of foes grows
Casket closed, air tight like Mystikal's cornrows
Expose rap niggas, take hoes from rap niggas
Never said shit when they seen me, get your toe tag nigga
The Compton lyricist, you niggas can't get with this
Used to tap Dre on the shoulder like, ""Nigga come hear this shit""
He thinkin' he slick and shit, nigga sweeter than licorice
Los Angeles god,
 
we mob like Infamous
Ain't from Queensbridge or Brooklyn but we done shook ones
Bullets, I done took some, crack, I done cook some
Don't you stand there and look dumb
Ain't no honor amongst thieves, especially when the hook come lives, I done took some

When I look around I hear something tell me
That I’m the type of nigga you could be down for
And I be hearing niggas say they gon’ kill me
And be the type of niggas I think I should make a move on
But I came to let you know I keep that heat for real

I kicks in doors when your rap bars is Iggy
I pull up floors and take them charges with me
Aventador as I explore the city
Phillipe's with my henchmen, nigga, word to Jimmy
You could be swimmin’ in the Hudson, it’s nothin’
Think I’m bluffin’? Guns cocked, say somethin’
Ain’t too many real niggas in this here rap shit
The industry soft when Plies getting slammed and shit
I feel like Mayweather in May weather
Whoop the white nigga ass, it might pay better
Got my Timbs on the gas in this grey sweater
Tag Coogi, I bet you’d be more cautious if you knew me
Your girl tryna do me, hoochie, groupie
She tryna catch up on a Gucci, baby, no, I’m out like Karrueche
Gave me that BJ so I slid in that Pizookie
And that’s why I’m the dookie
You fuck me, I’m fucking your bitch, stupid

When I look around I hear something tell me
That I’m the type of nigga you could be down for

But you know you still the one

And nothing can compare to the temper that you hear
When you get caught in a stare at the next derriere
Now she's explaining to you
That she's the baddest bitch that ever graced a pair of shoes
And if you wanna gamble to find better, you lose
And all this loud chirping that you consider rude

We may be arguing like we Cain and we Abel
Then we have some makeup love and we get back stable
Have a little girl, I cut the cord from her navel

Angel,LAX,2008.0,"Angel, angel
Angel, angel

I spent my day so, first I pray yo
Then I lay low, looking for the halo
Or more yayo, my little angel
Reminded me to stay playful
Faithful walks I take in the woods, thinking what's good
Things that I can change I should
Things I can't, need to be understood
Th-this is the bliss, I used to drift from the hood
For a second at least, I'm resurrecting the peace
Pipes that Indians used to light, we called it Chief, right?
Stepping on the leafs right to reach heights
Th-th-th-that I never seen, it's so so evergreen
Some use it for medicine, or to write better things
I was in Amsterdam man, bike pedalling
To the nature spot to taste the flavors they got
My eyes drop, I like it a lot
Yeah, my angel

I wanna turn up the sound and spread my wings
Because I'm riding with my (angel)
Going through the city of the Chi
Makes me feel like I'm in the city of (angels)
Ohh, I wanna fly, fly away with my (angel)
She takes me high, she will always be my (angel)

Th-th-the way that I rhyme blow nigga's mind
Like the first time you heard Mary J. and you were standing in line
To purchase tickets to see her blow like Chicago wind
And I'm ridin with Common looking for Chicago Zen
And like Chicago winds, I was once a Street Disciple
Rockin every Jordan shoe, Nike put out by Michael
That made me feel like I could fly, sometimes I wanted to die
Prolly cause the angel dust was fuckin with my third eye
So I started hip-hop and I understand why Common used to love her
She got me open so I even had to fuck her
But I used the rubber, cause she was married to Rakim
So I bought me a gold chain, pretendin' that I was him
So I can get close to the girl I loved the most
But she left Cali and went on tour with Ne-Yo and Ghost
Big gave her one more chance and she took Big down
I should've knew when Shock G and Pac told me she get around
An angel

I wanna turn up the sound and spread my wings
Because I'm riding with my (angel)
Going through the city of the Chi
Makes me feel like I'm in the city of (angels)
Ohh, I wanna fly, fly away with my (angel)
She takes me high, she will always be my (angel)

Fly away, fly away
My love for her is not about jewelry and cars
I love her cause she love me, just for who I are
Who I is, who I am, resembles the rims on the Lam'
I shine like Shyne when Barrington Levy was sayin
""Didilly whoooa!"", I got love for the streets
Peace to New York and every hood in the East
Before I was duckin' cops, gunshots
I used to be an L.A. Dodger, now I'm a (angel)
From the city of lost souls, Impalas and polished gold
Between the car and the rims, we got a lot of chrome
Your hood not alone, they knockin, we not at home
And when they bust in, we not Caesar, but gotta roam
Cause they try to wire phones, I'm talking Verizon phones
The ones they put wires on, they got us on tap
But I put wires on, my Bentley in fact
I spit it through the wires on a Kanye track

I wanna turn up the sound and spread my wings
Because I'm riding with my (angel)
Going through the city of the Chi
Makes me feel like I'm in the city of (angels)
Ohh, I wanna fly, fly away with my (angel)
She takes me high, she will always be my (angel)

Yeah, it's The Game and Common
Spread your wings, follow your dreams
Things will be so serene
L.A. and the Chi is a team

Looking out of my window I see forty cops

Used to be Christian, now that nigga Jew
Can't step foot in America so what he gon' do
P.Diddy's stuntman, Jackie Chan your ass through
Hood pass revoked, get your fucking brains blew
Blood on that yarmulke, now you really Piru
Soon as they killed Biggie that man became you
But you couldn't become him cause you were shooting at the roof

I said I always wondered why Puff wasn't in that truck

Doctor's Advocate, classic
Everything in between that shit and Jesus piece, classic

Chop it up, rock it up

And zone out, to this Frankie Beverly and Maze
As I daze about the past, and them days in the past
He set my mind free, so my mind free at last
So much that I don't even drink from a fuckin' glass
I'd rather find the first fountain I can and do it fast
Didn't understand the dream of a King, I do the math
Coincidentally on your birthdays, I ditched the class
Cause the younger me, dumber me was chasin' the cash
Chasin' the ass, lowlife with his face in the grass
Ridin' home from school, in front of the bus
Not even thinkin' 'bout how Rosa Parks done it for us
How she stayed behind bars and she done it for us
And she stayed behind bars 'til she won it for us
Sometimes I wanna give up or at least take a break
That's when I close my eyes and see Coretta Scott's face

Ohhhh

A whole new world outside this bubble
Way up high, I will fly
I will hover the world
Saw it all

Uhh, word up, Game
Standin' at the pew, panaramic view of the seatin' and greetin'
I've been meanin' to do me some letter readin'
To the King, he forever breathin', your message is never leavin'
Some of your homies phonies, I should've said it when I see them
Them sleazy bastards, some greedy pastors, jerks
Should never be allowed at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta
So people be patient, I know this ghetto grammar
But I'm a street dude, normally I just speak rude
Martin Luther, the martyr, the trooper, hate killed him
Nobel Peace Prize winner, they duplicate your feelin'
As a kid I ain't relate really
I would say your dream speech jokingly, 'til your words awoke in me
First I thought you were passive, soft one who ass kissed
I was young but honest, I was feelin' Muhammad
I ain't even know the strength you had to have to march
You was more than just talk, you the first real Braveheart
We miss you
Feel like King be in me sometimes

Way up high, saw it all
A whole new world outside this bubble
A whole new world outside this bubble
Way up high, I will fly
I will hover the world
Saw it all

The word ""
nigga
"" is nothin' like ""nigga""
Don't sound shit alike, like Game, like Jigga
One came before the other, like aim and pull the trigga
One is slang for my brother, one is hang and take a picture
The rope ain't tight enough, he still alive, go fix it
Pour some gasoline on him, call his daughters black bitches
Make 'em pick cotton, while they mama cleanin' up the kitchen
Same cotton in white T's, that's the cotton they was pickin'
If Dr. King marched today, would Bill Gates march?
I know Obama would but would Hilary take part?
Great minds think great thoughts
The pictures I paint, make the Mona Lisa look like fake art
I feel the pain of Nelson Mandela
Cause when it rains it pours, I need Rihanna's umbrella
For Coretta Scott's tear drops, when she got the phone call
That the future just took a fuckin' head shot
I wonder why Jesse Jackson ain't catch him before his body dropped
Would he give me the answer? Probably not

Way up high, saw it all
A whole new world outside this bubble
A whole new world outside this bubble
Way up high, I will fly
I will hover the world

I will hover the world

Gang banging had us addicted like it was Newports
Whoever thought that it would spread like petroleum
Now BP connect got us praying to them holy men
Just had a daughter, almost named her Katrina
If I raise her right, then maybe she can take over FEMA
Spike Lee in New Orleans shooting documentaries
And Game's still in Cali, eatin' off The Documentary
Take em to the symmetry I mean the cemetery
Where everybody boxed in: Refrigerator Perry

And every little fuck up, they blame it on Barack
Cause he's just like Gucci: Born in the Trap

Cause I'm just like Outkast, born in the Trap

So what's going on with you faggots?
And what you gonna do when your swagger no longer matters?
And your bitch ain't the baddest cause she in her mid-40s
And your Phantom played out so you hating on the shorties

Fucking bitches raw cause now the world ain't got no AIDS

Golddiggers sucked you dry left hickeys on you niggas
I used to run around like you, run the town like you
Walk my red nose and clown like you
But it got old like Betty White
This rap shit real deep like Barry White
Reminiscing on the days I used to carry white
Walking though them Crip hoods in the Cherry Nikes
Now I live a married life, walking in the house, to them home-cooked meals
Joint American Express accounts and less dollar bills

Just like Goodie Mob, I was born in the Trap
Niggas still got their hands out, begging for a stack
But just like Luda, I was born in the Trap
Leechers still got their hands out, begging for a stack
But like Soulja Boy, I was born in the Trap
Broke ass niggas still begging for a stack
Take 'em to Shawty Lo, nigga, learn how to Trap

Shit deeper than The Roots band
15s drumming, Questlove in the coupe fam
Ridin' through Pittsburgh, Wiz got the Steelers
Born by the jungle so I came with gorillas
Since niggas dropping more dimes than we fuckin'
We out the hood, tryna get money like P touching
Splitting backwoods just to get our weed stuffed in
The crack we cookin, we don't need ovens
We need something to put in the mouth of our kids
Instead of copping chains, lets fly to Chile and dig
Go to Haiti and feed, to the Bahamas and breathe
On the way back, scoop my nigga Shyne from Belize, you know
Sometimes I feel like this rap shit is heaven sent
Then I get a high, feel like it's irrelevant
So I'm about to pop the trunk like an elephant
And campaign with Wyclef while he run for president

'Cause doin' 25 to life is a roadblock
Welcome to my last album, Nip, time to close shop

Twenty million dollars actin' broke, nigga (Broke, nigga)
All you niggas sleep, stay woke, nigga (Work, nigga)
All my niggas came up sellin' dope, nigga (Dope, nigga)
Why the fuck you think they call us dope niggas?
Broken home, broken dreams, no hope, nigga (No hope, nigga)
Why the fuck you think we sellin' dope, niggas? (Dope, niggas)
This for all my dawgs and my locs', nigga (Locs', nigga)
Gotta get our neck up out these ropes, nigga (Ropes, nigga)

Fire to the spoon put you on the moon
Make America Great Again? You a fuckin' coon
And you niggas wonder why I'm unenthused?
'Cause hard bottoms trump runnin' shoes
And the less you know, the longer you live
And the more you know, they tappin' your crib
My niggas that say they got shot and actually did
Who never thought what happened to Pac would happen to B.I.G?
What happened to L, what happened to Proof, and Jam Jay though?
Hip-hop'll lean on you, R.I.P. to Fredo
Young niggas stay woke, old niggas stay woke
It's rainin' hollow tips, I'm drippin' in this Gucci raincoat
Security won't pat me, niggas won't at me
Same nigga that saved the West with a bald head and some khakis
Watchin' Kendrick show while Top Dawg dap me
This my last album, muhfucker, I hope you happy

Twenty million dollars actin' broke, nigga (Broke, nigga)
All you niggas sleep, stay woke, nigga (Work, nigga)
All my niggas came up sellin' dope, nigga (Dope, nigga)
Why the fuck you think they call us dope niggas?
Broken home, broken dreams, no hope, nigga (No hope, nigga)
Why the fuck you think we sellin' dope, niggas? (Dope, niggas)
This for all my dawgs and my locs', nigga (Locs', nigga)
Gotta get our neck up out these ropes, nigga (Ropes, nigga)

This shit's over
Say this your last shit, I don't believe you, Chuck
I remember L.A.X., nigga
Bring that beat back for me though, I gotta say somethin'
Yeah, Chuck, what up?

I was like, 'Fuck rap music', I'm gon' rob me a bank
Starvin' artists ain't my style, that shit'll drive me insane
Gave my mind to these millions and my heart to the game
Probably die up in these streets but I survive through my name
Every nigga 'round me killers and I doubt it'd change
If the police get behind us, we go out with a bang
Early 2000s, Murder Inc. was a shame
We was sayin' bullets got no names
Nigga we was charismatic on these corners like 2Pac on stage
But, fuck a dream if it's not gon' pay
You feel me?
White Sox hat with my Glock on waist
Couldn't tell me I was not O'Shea
Posted at the Quick 'N Split, don't get caught on tape
'Cause they put them cameras up since they shot Quinn Shay
Chuck, I remember your white Range
Slauson Ave., ran up on you, gave you my mixtape
Now

Twenty million dollars actin' broke, nigga
All you niggas sleep, stay woke, nigga
All my niggas came up sellin' dope, nigga
Why the fuck you think they call us dope nigga?
Broken home, broken dreams, no hope, nigga
Why the fuck you think we sellin' dope, nigga?
This for all my dawgs and my locs', nigga
Gotta get our neck up out these ropes, nigga",https://genius.com/The-game-welcome-home-lyrics
Black on Black,Blood Moon: Year of the Wolf,2014.0,"'Sup, nigga, huh?
You know what this shit is?
Stay down and come up (Damn right)
Street niggas is street niggas alike
It ain't even one way, nigga (Two of America's most)
Stay down till you come up, nigga, uh
Four songs, nigga (Blood Money, let's go!)

Everythin' wrong, this can't be right
Winning so much, this can't be life (Yeah)
Shit get real, man, you can't hold back
(Stay on back, nigga, you gotta do what you gotta do)
If he left and came back in that black on black
I still do it for them niggas with them bricks on bricks
I still do it for them niggas with them nicks on nicks
Let me tell you how a real nigga supposed to bounce back
See I left and came back in that black on black

Nigga come through for a nine and a half
I'm a tell him ain't nothin' left
Nigga need an eight, tell him everythin' straight
All they gotta do is wait, tell a nigga I'm a chef
How you think a nigga went and got that Wraith?
Could've went to jail but I bought that case
Lawyer came through, told him it's about time
Jim Carrey to the Rollie, I just switch that switch
Put ten karats on my daughter ear, fuck it
She deserved every rock I done sold out in public
Do anythin' for my Destiny's Child
She a Beyoncé, never be LeToya Luckett
Black on black, checkerboard Louis luggage
On a PJ feelin' like Warren Buffett
With the Minnesota Twins, ain't no Kirby Puckett
Lift the shade, see the clouds, tell Aaliyah that I love her
Back and forth in a Lear
My grandmother say I never see her
She want me come home on Thanksgivin'
Put on some black on black like here
Black on black to my dear
Black on black in my ear
Black Maserati that I gave to my mama
Right hand to the father, she can't even find the gears

Everythin' wrong, this can't be right
Winning so much, this can't be life (Yeah)
Shit get real, man, you can't hold back
(Stay on back, nigga, you gotta do what you gotta do)
If he left and came back in that black on black
I still do it for them niggas with them bricks on bricks
I still do it for them niggas with them nicks on nicks
Let me tell you how a real nigga supposed to bounce back
See I never came back in that black on black

Hold up, hold up, hold up
Shit get real, we don't fold up
This is what I told myself in my grandma's kitchen
At the table, nigga, choppin' my blow up
Said she want to sell more like my father
Same time, had me for a couple dollars
Yeah, I'm 'bout to pull an all nighter
I'm 'bout to kill these niggas so you might not see me 'til tomorrow
Just like that, then my palms start itchin'
Suede hit the block, then my bong gone missin'
See, I'm 'bout to take me a trip to the other side of town
And I'm goin' there to find me a chicken
Yeah, I got a nigga in the spot with a nine right now
So, I'm goin' there to sell him a pigeon
My pastor told me that the money is the root of all evil
I said if it is, then I losin' my religion

If I had to be precise, tell you two things about life
Niggas win everyday, niggas fail every night
I say, ""Now Oprah got a billion dollars and you're nowhere near her""
Type of shit I tell myself while starin' in the mirror

Everythin' wrong, this can't be right
Winning so much, this can't be life (Yeah)
Shit get real, man, you can't hold back
(Stay on back, nigga, you gotta do what you gotta do)
If he left and came back in that black on black
I still do it for them niggas with them bricks on bricks
I still do it for them niggas with them nicks on nicks
Let me tell you how a real nigga supposed to bounce back
See I never came back in that black on black

Mayonnaise jar, straight drop, no whippin'
Electric's off, everything's spoilin' in the fridge
I ain't bathed in a week, house smellin' like pickles
Street showin' no pity, still gettin' to the business
Safety pin the zip break it down sell nickels
Had to ball him out of jail, blew the money on the bail
Went flat, bounced back from a 30-cent flipper
I don't even know a nigga livin' how I'm livin'
I don't even know how many times I've been to prison
Shit get gangsta, we call Hot Beezle
Bought two things at the third, I wanna appease you
Two-fifty-two on the scale, that's a nina
Eighteen zaps, five hundred-four grams
Add an extra gram when you weigh it with the bag
Real trap talk, keep it real, don't believe you
When you get out of line, swear to God, I'm a leave you
Dicks cut the water 'fore they kick a nigga door
Tried to flush it down the toilet but the dope just float
(Wooh!) Tear gas from the cannon
Everybody scramblin', but I ain't never panic
Double homicide, broad day, that's my jacket
Try to bird feed, cut throat, I'mma jack you
And I take change, I'm a serve when they askin'
Come from out of town, I'mma tax, no relaxin'

Everythin' wrong, this can't be right
Winning so much, this can't be life (Yeah)
Shit get real, man, you can't hold back

Oh, the whole world is a ghetto

The ghetto, the ghetto, the ghetto
The, the, the, the

It be jam-packed in front of the stoops in Siberia
Same way they are in the middle of Nigeria
Every part of the whole world, there's an area
That, if you're poor, another day alive is a miracle
The blocks in Watts got crooked cops that frame the innocent
No different from Flint, Michigan
Living in the D, checking in with the pimps and them
It's similar to O-Town, in the Southern Peninsula
Pretty city, skyscrapers will fool you, look through to
Inner cities the rich won't move to
The nice parts, they well-protected by a vanguard
The opposite of how these concentration camps are
Low-income housing, it dwells murderers
But children don’t qualify for health services
The bourgeois act like they don’t see starvations
Like they spraying Estée Lauder on sanitation

It seems like everywhere I go, everybody’s in a struggle
Oh, the whole world is a ghetto
Oh, the whole world is a ghetto
The ghetto, the ghetto, the ghetto
The, the, the, the

Streetlights come on, cop cars' lights flicker
They smoke us like cigarettes, need a light, nigga?
Used to chastise or string us up to spite niggas
War to fight for the culture, instead we eaten by vultures
They mix us like mimosas, hang us on wanted posters
Ask for license and registration with they gun out the holster
Some of us guilty, some of us not, some of us filthy rich
Others just watch us niggas drive up the block
We think we keeping it one hundred coming back to the hood
They think we flossin' money, so they pull a ratchet: what's good?
It happens in Compton, happens in Queens, happened to Big L
Happened to Chinx and 2Pac in that passenger's seat
Sometimes it's internal, happens to you before you happen to blink
What's beef? Cops killing niggas dead in the streets
So before we look outside, we gotta look within
Cause, now, we the dinosaurs, I think the world 'bout to end

I'm from the project buildings, high stories
My stories from violence to glory
Dog-eat-dog world, gory
In the gutter, brother despise brother
Throwing threats at each other
Broken bottles and bar fights with box cutters
Alcoholics, narcotics, organized
Families sleep from a gas stove, burned alive
They bagging up drugs with plastic gloves
On his way to the top with his cash, he shrugs
Kidnappers, degenerate thieves and gamblers
Stealing, panhandlers, wrapping grams up
Rubber bands on they Grams, what?
Playing cards and they bored
Members of gangs, living by and dying by the sword
Block parties, fools stamp debit cards
Your hood ain't no different from ours
We share the same dreams, same money
Same clothes and cars, instead we get the same jail bars

The world's a ghetto, the world's a ghetto
The world's a ghetto (Ghetto)
The world's a ghetto

Me and God's son, jumping out of project buildings in black parachutes
Both classic, both ride through the hood in a pair of coupes
Flow sick, mix the Henny with the Theraflu
He told me I was ill at that Houston's, nigga, where was you?
Hip-hop critics, sit the fuck down, get a chair or two
I ain't tryna kick knowledge, just a pair of graphic parables
Grew up, spent the whole middle school in the same pair of shoes
Me and my brother sharing shoes, my childhood was terrible
That's why I spend nights on the rooftop, smoking medical
You got a minute, my nigga? Let me break down the variables
Adapted to my surroundings, flow better than I used to
Momma, this for us buyers, for the days I wore FUBU
Having beaucoup dreams, deuce-deuce in jeans, my nigga
Now, I'ma end your career in two sixteens, my niggas

Eating chickens with these chickens, politicin'
We gon' get a new team or not?
They up and down like Impala switches
All these girls got extensions, even with the long hair
Everybody tripping, we mix Cîroc with Patrón here
Don't walk around alone here, everybody from a gang
Niggas ask you where you from
That mean you gotta run that chain
Smoking on that purple rain
We only smoke a certain strain
Soon as you call twice nigga

 mixed with embalming fluid
Bring your chin here blood, so I can put this llama to it
Disrespectful nigga, see this window? I send your mama through it
Do it for the coast, so we can toast to it
Who showed you all the Pirus, the SA's and how the Los do it?
Similar to how the vice lords and folks do it

I got a chrome four-four in my jeans
You got Gucci frames coverin the mark on your face
Cause he don't want you to leave, and I don't want you to stay
Sometimes I wanna snatch that nigga out his CLK

Remember me? Like father, like son
Had a million dollars 'fore I was 1
Cause my daddy hustle
We good now
Cause my daddy hustle
We out the hood now
Cause my daddy hustle

Winning like Steph Curry in the chip though
Used to be the only one, now I'm the big bro (I'm big too)
Know my daddy schizo, don't mess with his kids yo
Me and my brother tight (yeah), we like the Klitschkos
I love you daddy

Ten years later, I love you too sons
I do life in the box if they ever fuck with my two sons
You're my lil' man, I remember the first day you came out
Your lil' face, your big nose, your lil' feet, your lil' hands
You turned one, come in the room wobbly, lil' stance
And every time I walked in the house he used to do this lil' dance
On the cover of the album with them Chucks on
You cried for 6 hours, your mama in here going nuts on me
She said you had enough, I said we having fun
All babies cry when they're one, my career had just begun
And so did being a daddy
Car seat in my Escalade, you want me in the Caddy
Playing Like Father, Like Son, looking in the back seat
He don't look nothing like his mama if you ask me
On the first album Busta Rhymes did the hook
Now he can do it for himself, watch him and his uncle cook
Buss

I'm glad you grew up to becoming everything you could be
That's all I wanted for you young'n, like father, like son
And in the end I'm glad you only turned out better than me
I hope you know I love you young'n, like father, like son
Your daddy told you it was coming
Coming, your day was coming, I told you
Now daddy's here just keep on running
Running, just keep on running, I tell you

I wanna thank my baby mamas Tiff and Eliska for everything
Y'all deserve the world, I wasn't worthy of no wedding ring
It ain't be one day since I met you I wasn't there for you
Wasn't husband material, but you know I really cared for you
And I know you remember that time when he was 5
All these tours taking the toll, I can see it in his eyes
So I stopped tours, stopped rapping, didn't give a fuck about
Nothing that happened after recording The Doctor's Advocate
Catching up with my son, cause ain't nothing more important
Than walking inside the Footlocker, copping them matching Jordans
Helping him with his jumper, the day he turned 9
I asked him what he want for his birthday, he said to spend some time
So we kick it, that's my best friend, I don't have to get married
He still my best man, and that's forever
Anybody can be a daddy, just bust a nut and leave
But I'm a father, and I'ma be everything he need and more

I'm glad you grew up to becoming everything you could be
That's all I wanted for you young'n, like father, like son
And in the end I'm glad you only turned out better than me
I hope you know I love you young'n, like father, like son
Your daddy told you it was coming
Coming, your day was coming, I told you
Now daddy's here just keep on running
Running, just keep on running, I tell you

Every time I get in this booth
I'm reminded ten years ago I did it for you
Had this vision for you, and I know your daddy get in trouble sometimes
But I'ma stay up out this prison for you, I mean
You all my seed, lil' brother and both of your sisters
You all I need like Method and MJB
And I know I be wildin' sometimes, you told me (""Breathe daddy"") (1,1, 2,2, 3,3, 4,4)
Furthermore, I'm try'na stay outta trouble just for my sons
Even though it feel weird leaving my house without a gun
I just gotta do it, cause they might grow up and do this shit
Just cause they father do it, fuck with my kids and six Bloods
Jumping out a Buick, understand Puff choking that man for Jus
I'ma do my stuff even if I land in fucking cuffs
For every nigga out here without a kid
Have one and that's gon be the best shit you ever did
One

I'm Harlem, The Game's oldest son
I make straight A's and I'm a good kid
But more importantly, I'm safe
Because my daddy hustled his way out of Compton
So I could have a better life
That's my daddy
And I wish all kids had one like mine
The world would be a better place
One

This ain't nothing, nigga. All this gang banging shit - It ain't nothing, homie.  It ain't nothing. I'd give it up homie.  I'm in this shit for a purpose, man.  I got a reason, dude, to get up out of this shit, nigga. All that shit ain't nothing, homie. Ask yourself; what color is the flag? (Red, white, and blue). Yup, red, white, and blue. Now, what two colors are, did we pick? I'm talking about we as black people.  What two colors? Think about it.  We picked red and blue.  What's left? White. (Damn right, nigga.  We killing each other, homie.)

I am a nightmare walkin', psychopath talkin'
King of my jungle, just a gangster stalkin'
Livin' life like a firecracker, quick is my fuse
Then dead as a deathpack the colors I choose
Red or blue, cuz or blood, it just don't matter

My daddy was from Nutty Blocc, my uncle was from Nutty Blocc
My mama was from Hoover, how she end up here cuttin' rock?
Four year old on her lap, that was my older sister
Photos of Tookie and my father, now you get the picture
Cutlass outside on D's, you think it wasn't
15 inches, had Computer Love, subbin'
My parents 'bout to see Rocky at the Compton Drive-In
Halfway through the movie, her stomach start throbbin'
My pops start panickin', moms in the passenger seat
Scared of contractions so she's stiff as a mannequin
Pops put the car in reverse and then skrt'd out
""Drive motherfucker"" them the words my mom blurted out
80 down Wilmington, pull up at Killer King
Rush my mama to her room and let the doctor do his thing
Was a whole lotta blood, yeah I was born in it
Gang bangin' my family got torn in it, all over

Colors, colors, colors, colors, colors
My colors, colors, colors, colors, colors (yeah boy!)
Colors, colors, colors, colors, colors
My colors, colors, colors, colors, colors (yeah boy!)

Jordan got drafted to the Bulls, '85 here
My Uncle Greg sniffin' cocaine off my high chair
Mama in the kitchen cookin', pops on the couch baggin'
Cousin's loadin' Louis Vuitton duffles in the Station Wagon
Fiends walkin' in and out my house in old Nikes
Pops used to tell me: ""Son, don't you ever be like me
The Bloods want to kill me, the cops'll never catch me
And when you gang bangin', life's shorter than Joe Pesci""'
Then one night my pops came home off heroin
Shit changed, I'm glad my mama didn't marry him
Molested my sister that night 'cause she was scared
I was too young to help her and my brothers wasn't there
It was late night, 2AM, my mother at work
My sister came back up the stairs and it was blood on her shirt
Blood on her face, blood on her hands, blood on her legs
Turned on the light and everything was red
I'm surrounded by

Colors, colors, colors, colors, colors
My colors, colors, colors, colors, colors (yeah boy!)
Colors, colors, colors, colors, colors
My colors, colors, colors, colors, colors (yeah boy!)

Seven years passed, now a lil nigga seein' things
Playin' with them birds like Magic, we was the dream team
Posted up on the block, I had that Hakeem lean
Watchin' '64s hop my nigga, no green screen
Walkin' from the Tanas to the Cedars with my eyes closed
Red bandana in my pocket, how you hide those?
Larry Nickel's crack spot, my brother got me servin'
Couldn't cook, burnin' holes in my Dennis Rodman jersey
Then a nigga turned Pippen on these niggas, 40 sippin' on these niggas
If you Crippin', we was trippin' on you nigga
But the Crips would never lay down, they thought that it was they town
We thought it was ours so we would empty out the trey pounds
Ditched school especially since it was an all Crip school
I'm lucky I'm alive, but would you be if bullets hit you?
26 dead homies and 2 dead brothers
Compton is a cold motherfucker, niggas dyin' over

Colors, colors, colors, colors, colors
My colors, colors, colors, colors, colors (yeah boy!)
Colors, colors, colors, colors, colors
My colors, colors, colors (yeah boy!)

These rappers gimmicks, fuck an image
Straight out of Baldwin Village
If it's any real activity I'm in it, in the midst of the fiction
Still had a vision, look I never gave up
Game put me on this song and I fucked around and came up
I'm Jungles, most my niggas gone so I'ma do it for them
Antman, Nightmare, B.S.I.P., Tiny M
It's a struggle first, blessin' last
Like I've been hittin' licks all my life and I passed
Kept it active for my son, he know his daddy ain't a bitch
Been bangin' all my life, now I'm just tryna get rich
This shit is drastic, my flow bashin' on rappers I'm flowin' after
The cabbage is all that matters, I'm laughin', these niggas cowards
It's Osbe, gang bangin' is my hobby
Except my model cars it's a fuckin' dead body
I'm from The Jungles, all the homies call me Barzan

My Bitch,Doctor’s Advocate Unreleased Bonus Tracks,UnKnown,"Let me tell you a story 'bout this bitch I know
Grew up on the Southside, sucking dicks for dough
Give her a half a dollar, she'll put on a show
Do anything to be in a Dr. Dre video
The bitch went Hollywood, one trip to the West Coast
She got fucked by this white bitch, had her legs wide open
As long as my pockets were fat
I didn't give a fuck where the bitch was at
My pretty young thang, she keep my nuts drained
All the time she was plotting on my Aftermath chain
Bitch couldn't stay in here lane
Started running with this ho from the South, gold grill in her mouth
She put her on the track, gave her, her first thong
Introduced her to her two girlfriends from back home
Fucked the industry, tryna take the fast route
Ran into a gangsta and he turned they ass out

You gon' always be my bitch, my bitch, my bitch
And I'mma always love my bitch, my bitch, my bitch
I be always fuck my bitch, my bitch, my bitch
She gon' always be my bitch, my bitch, my bitch

From the projects hustled all day
Niggas called her Sophie from around the way
Used to play hard to get, so they thought she was gay
Booshie bitch who ever thought she was raised in BK
Moved out the hood, changed her name to Jay
Told everybody she'll be working with a mill one day
I was introduced to her back in '96
She had a wavy haircut and some big-ass lips
At first, she was hard to hit
Come to find out the last ten years she been sucking Big dick
Got a family now, a house made of bricks
Four grown-ass kids and ain't none of them shit
She still my bitch so I stayed around
But she always tryna Dash when other Dame's around
She tryna play the Game, but I got the bitch number
She said she won't, but she'll be back next summer


Last but not least, my gangsta bitch
From Compton always in and out of jail and shit
Bitch tried to burn Snoop, stole Chronic from Doc
Blew the whole West Coast, 
even tried to fuck Pac
Type of bitch to stand on Beverley Hills
Word on the streets, she got a few real niggas killed
I look up now she on my dick
Telling me how she always gonna be my bitch
Pop up at award shows always following me
Bitch doing dumb shit, got a college degree
No pre-nupt, one nigga got stick with her
I was smart, knew always not to fuck with her
What goes around comes around, scandalous shit
Somebody tried to kill that bitch
Burnt the bridges and ain't had one friend left
Niggas that know her called her the devil in that red dress",https://genius.com/The-game-my-bitch-lyrics
Murder,Sunday Service,2012.0,"Starin’ at Marilyn Monroe’s silhouette
While smokin’ my first cigarette
Listenin’ to Marvin ask his father about his death
How you shoot a nigga out, then shoot a nigga out?
Dead bodies in my dreams, Bob Marley on my couch
Pass me the blunt, he was smokin’ when he died
You really think Elvis Presley committed suicide?
I don’t, it’s either kill or you be killed
Ten pints of blood per human, ain’t no refills
One thing about us humans, nigga, we kill
Turkeys, chickens, pigs, each other, fuck us, we will
Take a life, lethal injection or free will
Tookie got murdered by the pigs, fuck did he kill?
That ain’t none of my business, though
But I’m the type of motherfucker make it his business, so
Open the book and turn that page
It reads Arthur Ashe died from AIDS, no
That’s murder, nigga

Murder
Gunfire, death is so quiet, ask why, tell ‘em it’s
Murder
The sun rise then hide by grey skies, that cry sounds like
Murder
Murder, murder, murder, murder
Murder, murder, murder, murder

Malcolm X standing on that stage
It was staged for him to see that gauge
Murder, nigga
Doctor King outside that room
Who knew that he would die that soon?
That’s murder, nigga
JFK sittin’ in that drop
He waved goodbye, then they blew off his top
It’s murder, nigga
Diddy seen Big, and Suge watched Pac
They both was ridin’ passenger when they got shot, it’s murder
Who the fuck killed Michael Jackson, his physician?
He died slow in his music, you ain’t really listen
Now his daughter gettin’ slapped by his sister
And that’s probably gon’ kill they mama
So I’m sorry Ms. Jackson, I’m sorry Ms. Houston, sissy
Might shed a tear but ain’t no sissy
‘Cause Whitney’s sill with me
And her death kinda hurt a nigga
So let’s get back to talkin’ ‘bout murder, nigga
John Lennon got shot in the back
And Paul McCartney couldn’t do shit ‘bout that
‘Cause it was murder, nigga
Listen, this ain’t about you and me
It’s about Trayvon Martin and Huey P
And how they shot down Sam Cooke
Twelve years of school and it ain’t in one damn book
Lee Harvey Oswald ‘bout to serve a sentence
From the crowd comes a revolver
That’s murder, nigga


Gaspin’ for air, niggas cling on
Tryin’ to fight the inevitable, sing on
You hear that fat lady warmin’ up?
The end came without a warning, huh?
Them niggas real with them rags on
Niggas get killed ‘bout them flags, homes
The Game told you what the play was
So it don’t matter what you say, cuz
Say Blood, these niggas livin’ what they die by
You out here playin’ while these niggas doin’ drive-bys
If murder was the case that they gave Snoop
Then how the fuck you thinking they gon’ save you?
Them niggas played you, you doin’ stand up
You a comedian there, boy, put your hands up
Don’t turn this to a 1-8-7
I have you leanin’ on the stairway to Heaven
Spittin’ blood, these are tales from the hood
Suicide sound quicker, but a murder sounds good
Wish a motherfucker would try to play me like a toy
You get a bullet in your motherfuckin’ head, homeboy
The people sayin’ that a drug overdose killed Hendrix
They bullshitted, it was murder
Or a plane crash killed Otis Redding
That’s how they said it, but it was murder
The cops kill us at alarming rates
They point they guns at the ones they hate (niggas)
If Bin Laden brought the World Trade down
Then how the fuck did he die just now?
Murder, murder (Murder, murder, kill, kill)
(They killin’ motherfuckers still)
(And I’m just tellin’ y’all the real)

Up On the Wall,The Documentary 2.5,2015.0,"Old pussy ass mark, bitch ass buster
Think you from LA cause you listen to some Mustard
This is Battlecat, my nigga Kurupt had the battle raps
We go back like four flats on the Cadillac
Nigga you ain't never been to a hood day
You don't know Ice Cube, today was a good day
You ain't never been dropped off in the jungles
Teared Khakis, red bandana wrapped around your knuckles
Me and my brother used to dip down in 'Shaw
Stopped at the Wiener Schnitzel, got socked in the jaw
By some sixties, I bombed back, the nigga pulled out
A strap, said it's 6-0, I ducked then he missed me
Now I'm back to Bompton
Before I hit the hood, a nigga gotta stop in the Swans
And pick up a sack, had fifty for an eighth
And I only had fifty, made it last all day
Smoking with the homies, my nigga G Weed from Nellaz
My nigga Hooter from Athens Park stay brackin'
Fo' line, deuce line, Bray still active
And the Cedars ain't giving no passes, why we asking?

How you gon bang if you really ain't from LA
We spray your gang up on the wall
Tell me
And how you gon' fade if you really don't know the dance
I see you really don't bang at all
Mark-ass

Murder was the case that they gave Game
Cops on the cutlass cause they know a nigga gang bang
Red bandana round the rear-view
""Where you say you from, Blood?"" Niggas can't hear you
Flag on the left side claiming you a Blood
Blue rag on the right side calling niggas cuz
Bout to get your mark ass chalked out on the West
This for all my niggas in the pen beating on they chest like

I said I need some pussy on my motherfucking wall
And I ain't got my commissary yet
I said the next motherfucker try to steal a cigarette
He gon' get a fucking pencil to the neck

That's on the set
Ooh, I'm a Tree Top rep, all the
Homies know is shoot choppers, handguns and Tecs
Not unless my niggas really get it popping
Tree Top niggas like the Hoovers in Bompton
Big Budda, Syke o, Slim 4, Lil Wack
Q-Ball, Lil' Wolf, TK, big back
YZ four, three, two strap
Quisha and Miss Lisa, house, where we at
It's the gang bang capital, 2 T's capitals
Enemies know the business, this shit is factual
Bompton's most hated, fuck it, shoot out and fade it
So my mama stay awake cause her son be gang banging
You don't know about the put ons and DPs
Hanging out on the block (coming through to squeeze)
Some outta town niggas disrespecting
I see why Suge Knight and Big U was arrested
(Can't forget about the Mexicans)
And I fuck with the villains and the swans on God

On God
I got niggas from Denver Lane that'll ride
I got esés that'll kill you at your job
I got some lueders by the Wiener Schnitzel
Hanging out with the pistols, making sure shit official
Big Who's and Day both got stripes
Both locked up for life, so if I ever hit the pen
I got a squad, hell yeah I'm on that gangsta shit
Nigga run up, knockout, he gon' think he's slick
Hub in the dub, nigga don't even trip
I get you chased by the grapes, nigga 300 crips
My nigga Magic from Avalon, Draws from neighbourhood
Get your ass dope fiends slipping in Hollywood
Hop from 6-0, Girch from Santana
Roc from Nutty Blocc, we tied our bandanas
And for my little nigga Frogg I gotta stay active
Blood in, Blood out, what's brackin'?

Go at us, have your shirt wet as Lake Havasu
Pop pop diggity drop drop, hopped in a hotbox
Smashed off, stashed the Glock, drop it off at the chop shop

You ain't gotta say byebye, baby this is hello
Put your hands in the sky, that's where we gon go
I like you so I gotta put a ring on that
You the one that I wanna put everything on that
Let's go, baby this is hello

She used to wake up to The View
Now she wake up with a view
Used to wake up to a kiss
Now she wake up to a shoe
Used to dream about millions
Now she workin with a few
Used to know one Porsche, now she know two
Chanel handbags stuck to her like glue
Minks and chinchillas, whole closet like a zoo
Agent Provocateur, Louis and lots of Dior
All her friends wearing Gucci so she don't rock it no more
Everytime we in Jimmy Choo, they gotta lock up the store
Walk out with boxes galore
Next week she cop her some more
Alexander McQueen cause she my queen
Spent an Aston Martin on the ring..


Soon as them butterfly doors go up on the Ferrari
She step outside the car on there, stumble into Bulgari
Fall in that YSL, try it on, you fly as hell
Don't really like it, but I'm buying it: might as well
Have her own reality show: no drama
Grab your girl, we're shooting real housewives in the Bahamas
2-piece Hermes, Bottega Veneta flats
Heard Diddy out here so you know where the party at
We on.. and I ain't even gotta ask twice
Cause when we hit the room she up and down like the gas price - damn!
Got chills thinking of last night
I swear you was a goddess in your past life


Girl I know you wanna get away
This hotel room, that's where it goes down
And I know we never get away
Just give me a couple minutes and I'm in it
We all over the table, ain't no problem with you sweating on me
And I ain't pulling out, I'm tryna have fun
I know you tryna have fun..
You ain't gotta say bye bye, baby this is hello
And you ain't gotta front for your friends, you know I had you at hello
And Louboutins that I got you on your birthday, that was hello
And all them bottles that we popped on the first date, that was hello",https://genius.com/The-game-hello-lyrics

Dear God, I now know what I've done
Through my thoughts and my actions
And the things that I've said
Sometimes by mistake and sometimes on purpose
Amen

Got my mind on this murder, and Problem so gassed up
Got a black Mac 11 and it hit like a Mac truck
Product of bad luck, played out on that movie screen
Had to scope with some killers, almost died from moving green
My mama a felon, my daddy so long gone
My grandmama died at 18, left me all alone
All I got is my guns, bandanas, some weed
Leave me with 2 dead brothers, my enemies gon' bleed
I'm masked up, suicidal, rest in peace to Hayes
Wasn't no killers, swear my niggas seen some better days

Laid out in the street, let his mama cry
White chalk, black streets
Red rack, coke killer, watch 'em leak
Black on black crimes, killing our own brothers
But what the fuck can you do when you got on the wrong colors?
Take a breath, inhale, let it go, lights off
Have a problem, hit the switch, lay it low
Soon as you walk out the crib, we gon' blast
Hit the 110 and now the one time on your ass
In 4 minutes, you thought that you got away with it
Thought that shit was a dream, let us pray cause

Fast forward, countin' this money on Aftermath for it
Bought a new Ferrari, gave my bitch ten stacks
Told her don't come back here 'til she got an ass for it
Told her run through mackin' in Louis to get a bag for it

You ain't Blood, you a bitch, you a big red stud (Oh)

All these guns in the car, I gotta wear a seatbelt

Too Much,Doctor’s Advocate,2006.0,"I'm from the old hood, somethin' like yo' hood
Where niggas don't know good, or know Suge, but the blow good
So we rock it like Tracy McGrady
Send it to Houston in a gray Mercedes
I'm a product of my environment, grew up in the 80's
So that mean, me Kanyeezy and Young Jeezy all crack babies
And it's evident my flow is heaven-sent
First LP, on the same shelf as the veterans
Nigga I can't be fucked, like a lesbian
I'm to hip-hop what Cartoon is to Mexicans
I'm an artist, never claimed to be the hardest
Just number one since B.I.G. and Pac departed
Nate ridin' with me, Snoop ridin' with me
All you other niggas used to be good like Ken Griffey
I'm on fire like the tip of a blunt
On fire like a nigga that let it drip for a month
I'm a Blood, you can Crip if you want, just let it bump
Like you got Scott Storch tied up in the trunk
I'm the ice cream truck man, guns in the trunk man
Drugs in the trunk man, call me the front man

Too much Cris' in the club not to get drunk
Too many bitches in the world not to fuck
Too much chronic in the studio not to roll it up
And too much bass in the trunk, so let it bump
You look like you mad as fuck, but who cares?
Grabbin' her by the arm, cause she stared
Don't know how much attention you pay
You better be ready to die, in this game

I thought I told y'all
I'm done with the beef, clown, my son three now
And I've been watchin' Dre so long I'm makin' beats now
Game on the rebound like Ben Wallace in the D-Town
I mean Chi-Town,
 fuck it, it can go down
Nigga I spit the whole round, fo' plus fo' pounds
Nigga this the wild wild West, call it a showdown
And I'm Billy the Kid 'til they split my wig
I come back from the dead, tell 'em kill me again
Put my head on a barrel, dare a nigga to shoot me
I'm gangsta, took more shots than Tookie
I'm alive, so I'mma take a Patron shot for Tookie
Roll a California blunt and keep watchin' a movie
Inspired by this gangbangin' shit since I was two
I brought the West coast back
, what the fuck you do?
I'm the ice cream truck man, guns in the trunk man
Drugs in the trunk man, call me the front man

Too much Cris' in the club not to get drunk
Too many bitches in the world not to fuck
Too much chronic in the studio not to roll it up
And too much bass in the trunk, so let it bump
You look like you mad as fuck, but who cares?
Grabbin' her by the arm, cause she stared
Don't know how much attention you pay
You better be ready to die, in this game

Drive fast, both hands on the dash
Close both of your eyes and hope that you don't crash
It's lyrical homicide, both airbags out
Roll the fuckin' windows down, let the bass out
Niggas, drop the top on whatever you in
Bitches, let your ponytail blow in the wind
Inhale the chronic, blow out dollar signs
Nigga you can drive a Bentley if only in your mind
Four doors, leather and wood
Ride like I got a horse stable under my hood
And I keep a chrome fo'five under my hood
So if I die, nigga bury me under my hood
Who had the hottest bitch in the game, wearin' they chain
Mr. H to the Izzo, Nas and Hurricane
Long as my family straight, read this at my wake
I gave 'em The Documentary and they scraped the plate
Twenty magazine covers, nigga look at his face
I can not, will not ever be replaced
Cause I'm the ice cream truck man, guns in the trunk man
Drugs in the trunk man, call me the front man

Too much Cris' in the club not to get drunk
Too many bitches in the world not to fuck
Too much chronic in the studio not to roll it up
And too much bass in the trunk, so let it bump
You look like you mad as fuck, but who cares?
Grabbin' her by the arm, cause she stared
Don't know how much attention you pay
You better be ready to die, in this game

Never

Whether we dribble out this motherfucker
Wrap rock or riddle out this motherfucker
We gon' get up out this motherfucker
Same way that Venus did, Serena did, we them kids
Whitney was talking 'bout, that's how it was
Before my brother caught them slugs and I watched coroners chalk him out
That ain't my brother in that box, what niggas talking 'bout?
Couldn't Paul Bearer 'cause I was too weak to walk him out
And that's real shit, I'm dedicated
Like Pac was to Jada before Jada met Will Smith
I'm already turnt up, chronic still burnt up
Fuck outta here, with all that lean and popping pills shit
Jump in my Impala get it hopping with a kill switch
I done been around the world, my life is like a field trip
I done been to Africa, seen niggas in Attica
Cops killing our youth, these numbers ain't adding up
Like that white boy sitting in a prison cell
Killed 9 people in a church, how he living still?
I couldn't understand, I spent hours
With Farrakhan, just begging him to let me be the millionth man
But some of these niggas just make you wanna kill a man
And let the .38 spin like a ceiling fan
Separate your body from soul, soul from Earth
Roll a blunt with your remains and then ash it in the dirt
Listen, you ain't a Christian 'cause you go to church
Listen, you ain't a gangster 'cause you got the work
A real gangster's one who take care of his whole family
Like me, even though my baby mama can't stand me
Her name tattooed on my neck, nigga it's branded
And my fucking kids tighter than Ray J and Brandy
Yeah, I give it to you so you understand
Fucking bitches took my family

Bye baby, rock-a-bye baby
No tears or sobs, baby, been listening to Nas lately
And I can't lie, baby, been missing them thighs, baby
But it's more to life than Gucci and Louis Vuitton, baby
It's more to life than tripping on lies, baby
Put feelings aside, baby, you Nicki Minaj, baby
One day we all die, baby
So I'd rather go hard, keep Cali alive, baby
Yeah, keep Cali alive, baby
Double entendre, nigga, that's my baby
And don't nobody father kids like me
Word to Kevin Hart, take care of they rib like me
I made fucked up decisions but don't let 'em crucify me
I'm still the same nigga on my California ID
Yeah, Compton nigga
Blame Dre, it's his fault that I'm a monster, nigga
I was selling crack in west side Bompton, nigga
Yeah I can rap, but I ain't ask for no sponsors, nigga
I was light skin and young, Klay Thompson, nigga
15, had guns like Contra, nigga

Yeah I still remain
So tell me why you hate the game
So tell me why you hate the game
This time I do it better just because

Y'all know what it is
The streets named me Illmatic but yet I'm still at it
Can't hate us

Felon, Vice behind me on the intersection
Sex and drugs my anthology on perfection
Dress superb, admired by conspirists
Who wanna try me but ain't high enough to 4-5 me up
Child of the 80s, y'all niggas is lazy
Complainin' 'bout labor pains nigga show me the baby
And my nigga Game light another L, pass the bottle
Pro-black I don't pick cotton out a aspirin bottle
Yeah I learned my lessons and heard y'all snitchin'
Witnessin' you rockin wit' narcs confirmed my suspicion
Green fatigues on, my niggas I'll bleed for 'em
I can show 'em the water but can't make 'em drink it
And I can show them my fortunes but can't force 'em think rich
And still I don't abort 'em when and if they sink quick
Ignore the ignorance I rep the brilliance of Queensbridge
And pray the feds let Murder Inc. live

'Pac is watchin' B.I.G. is listenin'
While Pun talkin' to us Jam Jay still spinnin'
To every nigga listenin', I was supposed to be amongst kings
My mom shouted out at my christenin'
And while you still listenin', 
Shyne locked in a manhole
And Cam got shot inside his Lambo, it's ample
Life is a gamble, 15 years old, red rag around my head
My sisters used to laugh and call me Rambo
Seen Eazy's legacy melt away like a candle
I rekindled the flame, Dre created The Game
Nigga Wit a Attitude, from the cloth I came
Young homie ate his way up from the bottom of the food chain
Keep the crown, clown. I rock a L.A. Dodger fitted
Showed my ass at Summer Jam but New York was down wit' it
Now the ball's in my court never dribble out of bounds wit' it
Behind the back to Nas he alley oop to Jigga, nigga

I even pass the dutchie to them niggas that don't love me
I'm talkin' niggas that never wanted to see me on top
Same niggas that never wanted to see The Doctor's Advocate drop
Flop, I think not, I fuck you rap niggas like virgins
Dre took my trainin' wheels off it's curtains
I don't need no encore no claps no cheers
The Game ain't over this the beginning of my career
The endin' of yours the endin' of his
Like Flavor Flav's clock, I'm back to handle my biz
Nigga it's Game time that was Dre's favorite line
Back when Proof was in the booth and I recited his lines
And I still think about my nigga from time to time
Make me wanna call 50 and let him know what's on my mind
But I just hold back cause we ain't beefin' like that
He ain't B.I.G. and I ain't 'Pac we just eatin' off rap

Usually we do this at the beginning

I need 1500 or Nothin' wit' me

Clap along, stomp along, catch a lil' Holy Ghost
And if you ain't feelin' good God willin'
By the end of this record, we gon' change all that

Alright everybody please join in, ya life ain't good

All I see is dead people
Used to hustle with my momma tryna make a couple dollars
Any nigga with a problem, they be dyin' over dead people
Muthafuckin' dead people

This shit gets deep, don't fuck with me
You end up six feet deep, listen to how I did it
I crept up slow on Willow
Thinkin' 'bout climbin' through the fuckin' window
In the backseat, potato burners
Ski mask, body bag, duct tape, and a pillow
In the front solo, sittin' low with the lights out
Feelin' like Manson on some Son of Sam shit
With a murder on my mind that my mind on the homicide
And my watch said they outta time, somebody gotta die, bottom line
Front page, column nine, headline: Another Columbine
I planned and plotted and strategized, and thought about it
Loaded up everything in the closet
My objective is to get bloody, they can beg and plead, yell and scream
Try to leave, get in cheese, pray to God on they knees
But I'm still gettin' fucking ugly, I fuckin' love it
Took this nigga by his throat and fuckin' cut it and thought nothin' of it
It's simple insanity, just a murderous fantasy
It's simple insanity, just a murderous fantasy of mine
(Man, I feel like killin' me a muafucka)

Last night, I must've had a blast choppin' up bodies
Woke up bloody as fuck in the hospital lobby
Body filled with adrenaline
Not rememberin' what I did to get all this blood on my fuckin' Timberlands
Cop's sayin' I did what to him?
Showin' me pictures of cut-up bitches
Disfigured members with body parts missin'
Listen, I ain't do shit, I don't know shit
Man, I don't give a fuck about that bitch
Fuck whatever she said, fuck whatever she saw -it wasn't me
Oh no no, not me, listen to the alibi
I was at the movies -that Avatar shit, with them 3-D glasses on
And that shit longer than muafucka
Look at my pocket, get the ticket stub
That's my alibi, bitch, now what up?
Fresh out the cuffs, now I'm back on the outside
And headed west where Homicide reside, that's my nigga
He live on 1st and 48th right next to the white chalk
In between the yellow tape, behind the black gate
Rottwielders and pitbulls, surrounded by snakes, AK's and AR's
Some niggas hard to play, some niggas play hard
But that house right there, don't go in they yard
It's simple insanity, just a murderous fantasy
It's simple insanity, just a murderous fantasy of mine
(Man, I feel like killin' me a muafucka.)

Beware of dark shit, shot 'em through the fence
Tough offensive line men couldn't stop the blitz
Them niggas inside, a couple kittens
And this right here: good riddance
Nigga fuck around, its suicide for instance
Picture the mind of a bullet
Here I come, I can smell the flesh aimin' for your head or neck
Nigga, pray to God I won't hit your chest
Now here I come straight outta drum, headed for your lungs
You in my sight
The last one didn't do it right
And I'm waitin'
Just lookin' at you
Thinkin' 'bout it and gettin' tired of lookin' at you
Hi, daddy, remember me?
Goodbye, daddy, this is what it gotta be
You brought me in this world, now I'm takin' you out
Now you open up your muthafuckin' mouth

So you know what we gon' do?
We gon' live it up to the fullest
Ayo, Game—talk that talk

In '05 Nas said I was the truth
Niggas thought I was from New York, niggas thought I was off the stoop
Till I pulled up with Snoop like Dre did in ""G Thang""
Wasn't no limit after that so I did my Master P thing
Middle fingers to my enemies
Working on The Documentary with Nate Dogg, sippin' my Hennessy
First thing I recorded was me and 50
""Hate It or Love It"", I had more Cincinnati hats than Ken Griffey
Whole hood had them Black Wall tats
Me, Fase, G-Rod, where Buddha Ru and Frogg at?
I put my hood on like it was cold as fuck
West side Cedar Block and niggas know what's up
I'm with the shit though, my album drop, I ball like a disco
15's in the Bentley, bass hit hard like the Klitschko's
Wrist glow, my bitch know I'm bipolar
Half Gandhi, half schitzo but my 16's US missiles

Put some sauce on it

I think I put too much sauce on it

Max B is the Wave God, I'm with the sauce though
Never had 5 mics in my life so fuck The Source ho
As far as awards go, they gave away my Grammy
Gave it to Missy, I was too gangster and they ain't understand me
I had too much sauce
Before my time I was too much boss
In a Maybach with a mil, too much Ross
My freshman class'll whoop your freshman class ass
It was me, Ye, Snowman, Banks, Buck, and Fab
Everybody wore platinum cause everybody went platinum
And you woulda thought The Unit was coached by Phil Jackson
The N was raw, it's Tim McGraw
Them Henny caps was spinnin' off
You had beef and niggas saw you?
They smacked you like a tennis ball
We hit 'em off, invented ball
Had bitches wet in Senegal
Showed niggas Lamborghini doors
Before they had Aventadors
I get it off, I've been a boss
Gettin' bricks off in them rental cars
I did it all but I'm spillin' sauce
Can't stop blood like menopause

The sauce is hot, the sauce is hot, hah
The sauce is hot, the sauce is hot, hah
The sauce is hot, the sauce is hot, hah
The sauce is hot, the sauce is hot, hah
Put some sauce on it

Tossed the bitch salad last night with no ranch
I like it sweet and sour cause I grew up off of Rosecrans
Showed Kendrick his first Benz
Showed Problem if niggas had a problem I jumped in
I was a YG when YG was just a little nigga
Had white bitches swallowin' sauce up out of my Hilfiger's
He's so Compton, niggas hate him, bitches love 'em
Bought my first Bentley and let Kim and Paris picked the colors
Then we gassed off like NASCAR
I done drove everything except Madagascar's
My flow sick-ill, I'm off them bath salts
I used to fuck bitches that Usher Raymond passed off
Then I fucked three Kardashians, hold that thought
I'm that raw, not that raw, Trojans on deck
Like USC synchronized swimmers, I keep them hoes wet
And if you havin' girl problems I feel bad for you son
I got 99 problems but the sauce ain't one, hit me

Swerve, I'm still dope, that's my word
All I did was switch the kitchens and subtract all the birds
Irv... Gotti know I'm a murderer
Half these niggas beefin' with me, I never heard of them
If I was the old me, I would murder them
Matter fact, if I was the old me? I would CURTIS them
Courtesy of my Smith & Wesson
I kill tracks like AIDS nigga, get infected!

The whole world been waitin' on him
Here I come, droptop Phantom I'm skatin' on 'em
Look around, all the bitch niggas hatin' on him
Mad cause I'm Chronic 2008'n on 'em
Big cars, big wheels, big chains (Yeahh)
Big pimping, big money, big dreams
Dreams (Dreams) big dreams
Dreams (Dreams) big dreams, dreams

I ""Get Money"" like Junior M.A.F.I.A. used to
On my way to school, ten thousand in my FUBU
Lunchtime I was sellin'
Behind the bungalows, baggin' up rocks the size of melons
That's when the fiends start tellin'
You can catch 'em on the couch, everyday at 4 o'clock like Ellen
Primetime nigga, is my time nigga
Jacob ain't got shit to do with my shine nigga
Cause when the sun come up
From behind the sea, niggas see me behind the B
ENT, don't stand for entertainment
It stand for zero to 60, anybody see where Game went?
To the hood, parked crooked behind that chain fence
And I'm goin' down behind my dogs but I ain't Vick
Tell me one album I put out that ain't sick?
No I'm not the Doctor, but I produce the same shit!


Big cars, big wheels, big chains (Yeahh)
Big pimping, big money, big dreams
Dreams (Dreams) big dreams

The Chronic, Makaveli to Doggystyle
Bad influences, so my momma told me to turn 'em down
She went to sleep so my father said I could turn it up
What did he care, he in the bathroom sherm'n up
So I let that Dogg Pound rock
Let that Ice Cube knock, 'til my sister pressed stop
Soon as she left out, like Diddy, I Pressed Play
That's when that Hard Knock Life, introduced me to Just Blaze
I would sit in my room, and just blaze
Before chronic had all these funny names, it was just haze
No hash, cause it was just haze
And I would get so high, nigga that I would just gaze
I mean I was so amazed somethin' so fuckin green
Could turn this little-ass house into a maze
Chronic 2001, got me through my hardest days
And just think, my momma said marijuana was a phase

Yo Jay, what it do, nigga?
I done rocked enough fellas to be you, nigga
I got my 40-40, they my two Jiggas
They’ll make you ‘Holla Holla’, I Ja Rule niggas
The lions in the room, what up Fat Joe?
I’m Curtis' Kryptonite, and the nigga Joey Crack know
Whoever said “The Game over” must’ve had a hangover
Get money, my driveways sponsored by Range Rover
I got Blood Diamonds, straight outta Angola
The way my red rag in the air signal Lil Wayne over
Yeah, that’s when the Cris start poppin'
The pills start droppin' and the haters start watchin'
The DJ starts spinnin', the panties get to droppin'
For album number 3, and going Platinums not an option
I’m back with Cool & Dre, AKA ‘The Monsters'
And I got one word for you motherfuckers..
COMPTON!


You was wrong momma
Shit I love you but I'm still smokin
I love you momma!
Chronic 2001 to infinity MOTHERFUCKER, haha
Dr. Dre started it
I just finished it! I mean, a-hem
Picked up where the big homey left off, FEEL ME?

 Aftermath, Compton to Jersey
What y'all fools know about perculatin' on lo-los?
Mics and six-fo's, nigga
Ha ha, no more hand claps, please, nigga
Here we go - Just Blaze!

To all my niggas on the porch gettin' they hair braided
Cornrowed by a L.A. bitch
And I can't forget, my niggas ridin' the train, 
Yankee fitted
Snub nose under that Pelle shit
I love New York, but gangbangin' that's L.A. shit
And I'm proud of it, spit it through the wire so the crowd love it
Haters you know who you are, you could turn it down, fuck it
I could shoot a video to it and spend half the budget
I'm gangsta, let the 40 cal' blow in public
More hatred inside my soul than 'Pac had for Delores Tucker
Every time one of my niggas get shot, the more I suffer
'Cause we trapped inside a world where you forced to die for your colors
I seen it all through the Range tints
Got niggas doin life in the state pen
So I dread like Jamaicans
If I die for one of my statements
Then break up the streets of Compton
Spread my blood in the pavement

Believe me, niggas keep sayin' they gon' heat me up
Talkin' that shit like they gon' lay me down
But when I come through strapped to see what's up
Niggas really don't want no parts of me pal
Niggas keep sayin' they gon' heat me up
Talkin' that shit like they gon' lay me down
But when I come through strapped to see what's up
Niggas really don't want no parts of me pal

Who I gotta talk to, who I gotta write
Get my Reebok deal done or I'm stayin' in Air Nikes, aight?
I handle bars, you ain't gotta ride a bike
To beat Game in his skills, here go some trainin' wheels
Let's roll, through the City of God, where niggas trained to kill
We'll chop you up a hundred times worse than the Haitians will
For real, nah, Pharrell, I need a track, homie
Dre we too close, ain't no turnin' back, homie
Deal with it, I'ma be here for ten years
Spittin' like the ghost of Eric Wright and Big, yeah
Let me paint this picture while you sit here
Thinkin' in the back of your mind, 'this is the shit,' yeah
I spit for niggas doin' 25 on their fifth year
Ready to throw a nigga off the fifth tier
Them white boys in the Abercrombie & Fitch gear
And every nigga who ever helped me to get here

Believe me, niggas keep sayin' they gon' heat me up
Talkin' that shit like they gon' lay me down
But when I come through strapped to see what's up
Niggas really don't want no parts of me pal
Niggas keep sayin' they gon' heat me up
Talkin' that shit like they gon' lay me down
But when I come through strapped to see what's up
Niggas really don't want no parts of me pal

It go one brick, two brick, the boy movin' weight
Now three bricks, four bricks, I'm drivin' upstate
Five bricks, six bricks, the nigga got cake
Not rap money, but money been wrapped since eighty-eight
Look at the world we live in, niggas steady hate
'til the Heckler and Koch, leave 'em chopped up like Freddy's face
Niggas catchin' feelings 'cause I'm about millions
And out of all the newcomers out, my flow the illest
You a close second nigga, banana to a gorilla
Put us in the same cage, and I'ma have to peel 'em
The best of both worlds, rappin and drug dealin'
Run and tell Lateef I came to burn down the village
The head honcho, starin' out the third story window
Of my Beverly Hills condo
Two long-ass Heats, I call 'em Shaq and Alonzo
You niggas want me out of L.A., geah, I know

Believe me, niggas keep sayin' they gon' heat me up
Talkin' that shit like they gon' lay me down
But when I come through strapped to see what's up
Niggas really don't want no parts of me pal
Niggas keep sayin' they gon' heat me up

Never Can Say Goodbye,LAX,2008.0,"93.5 K-DAY, givin' you the taste of good life, your girl Yo-Yo
Should I say is it still all good?
Today at 12:45 outside the Petersen Museum here in Los Angeles
Notorious B.I.G. was gunned down and pronouced dead at 1:15 this morning
As a result of the ongoing feud between East and West coast
The tragic death of 2Pac Shakur who was gunned down in Las Vegas
Just six months earlier, our prayers go out to the families

A sad day today for the West coast, we lost an icon y'all
Eric 'Eazy-E' Wright, passed away today at 6:45 PM
Cedars Sinai Hospital, due to complications from AIDS
A definite West coast legend, brought you N.W.A.,
Brought you Michel'le, brought you D.O.C., and the list goes on
We definitely gon' miss you Eazy

Picture me rollin in that black B-M-dub, headed to the club
Fresh out the Tyson fight, Beamer all rimmed up
Shinin' with the big homie, five-car caravan
Ridin' shotgun, put that chronic smoke in the air
Me Against the World is what I told my foes
So it's me against the world, 'til they poke them hoes
Leanin' out the window, flickin' ashes off the indo
Throwin' up Westside, I see, some of my kinfolk
Pull that blunt closer to my mouth 'cause only she know
I'm feelin' bad about that nigga we stomped out in that casino
But fuck it it's Death Row, the big homie never told me
That my next blow could be my fuckin' death blow
Tell Kidada I'm not ready, I ain't even let my momma know
I ain't got no kids, I'm only twenty-fo'
Before I can let the smoke out, niggas let twenty go
The thirteen that hit the car was through the passenger do'
Now come wit it

Never can say goodbye, never can say goodbye (to my friends)
Never can say goodbye, never can say goodbye (to my friends)
Never can say goodbye, never can say goodbye (to my friends)
Never can say goodbye, never can say goodbye (I will always keep you near)

I love it when they call me Big Popp-a
I only smoke blunts if they roll prop-er
Look I gots ta, catch the first thing smokin' in Cali
And hit one of my bitches in the valley
Gotta call my nigga Sean, tell him reserve the Dom
Tell him to get the chron' and the teflon
I think they trippin' off the homie gettin' shot
But God bless his soul, Lord know it wasn't Pop
Or the M.A.F.I.A., Kim tell Cease get the fuckin' truck
We 'bout to hit the Wilshire district, get fucked up
Pop mad bottles son, twist up the Phillies
I'm thinkin' 'bout T'yanna, these niggas is lookin' silly
If this was Blooklyn I would up the 9-milli
But fuck it we to the truck, roll the dutch, we out of Phillies
Hop in the front seat, of that dark green Suburban
Heard another car swervin', gunshots close the curtains
Biggie!

Never can say goodbye, never can say goodbye (to my friends)
Never can say goodbye, never can say goodbye (to my friends)
Never can say goodbye, never can say goodbye (to my friends)
Never can say goodbye, never can say goodbye (I will always keep you near)

Layin' in this hospital bed with bronchitis, I can't talk
Walked myself in and all of a sudden I can't walk
IVs in my arm, my wife Tomica at my legs
Ruthless, I mean Records, we got married on my deathbed
I could hear Jerry Heller in the hall
But I couldn't hear Cube and Dr. Dre no more at all
Through all the bullshit them niggas was my dawgs
Niggas With Attitudes spray painted on the walls
I'm flatlinin', it's bad timin'
Straight Outta Compton, the king of gangsta rap's dyin
Cause of death, the AIDS virus
Conspiracy, I guess the government just hate violence
They thought my group influenced the L.A. riots
Woulda been here to see my kids grow, if I stayed quiet
Took 12 years for a real nigga to break silence
Eazy I had to let 'em know
You could catch me, cruisin' down the street in my six-fo'

Never can say goodbye, never can say goodbye (to my friends)
Never can say goodbye, never can say goodbye (to my friends)
Never can say goodbye, never can say goodbye (to my friends)
Never can say goodbye, never can say goodbye (I will always keep you near)",https://genius.com/The-game-never-can-say-goodbye-lyrics

Shoot the courts out when Killer Wayne brought that Porsche out

Patrick Ewings on, I kept the fresh kicks
Take a nigga out his Jordan's if the motherfuckers fit (they fit)
They fit so I'm back up the block
Fuckin' with the homies tryin' to teach them how to slap box
In front of the crack spot fiends fightin' over crack rock
Dimes the size of golf balls, yeah, them shits was that hot
He had them black Locs on like MC Ren
And Deebo came through in the hood in that coke-white Benz
Before 106 & Park and 24 inch rims
Before these corny niggas kept the stickers under they brims

Got my ass whooped for takin' the Duck Hunt gun outside
In my window watchin' all the kids have fun outside
Ice cream truck makin' noise, I want to run outside
But I'ma get my ass whooped again if I run outside
Swear I was on punishment until my tenth grade year
This new girl move on the block, light skin with wavy hair
I asked her did she want to hump me, she was like, ""I don't care""
So I took off her training bra, that's when she got scared
She wanted me to be her boyfriend, so I was like, ""Yeah""
I'm tryin' to think of LL lines in the back of my head
""When I'm alone in my room"" I can't remember what he said

Pull up in that Enzo then I do donuts
I’m that cool, cashews, make 'em all go nuts
(Baby got ass, I need me a shot of that
Lil mama get gangsta for me, stuff it in your Prada bag)
That's right, she's got something that I wanna see
That's right, so if she leave, she fucking with me
That's life, twerk something, work something, hurt something
She wanna check, check this shit out like a verse coming
They rip their neck and run their mouth when they heard something
Dre dropped another one and fucked around and murdered something
Club filled with dead bodies
If not then you a zombie, I'm not gonna feel sorry
You pass out from it, get drunk, get blunted
Do what you wanna do, drug test on you

Lotta money when I talk
Big mills, big deals ‘bout a hundred in a vault
Sit still, that real, lotta haters throw salt
They lost big Game give a fuck how you feel
I fear she just might just pop that pill
And feel on me all night till the tip spill
Tip scales with her waistline, sex with the bassline
She gon' fuck a snare drum one drink at a time

Blow right, hoes fight over my name
I got my dough right, hustle running all in my veins
It’s forty days, forty nights if I’m making it rain
I reign supreme, a bottle and some bomb-ass weed then we good

If you got drugs in this motherfucker
Let me see your hands in the air
Narcotics in the club and the ladies love us
So let's get high off something
High off something, high off something
'til your mothafucking brain don’t function
High off something, high off something
What I supply taking you high?

Fireworks when I spark, yellow tape
Lotta chalk thought you said you a boss
Big deal, bitch chill, pulling out that black card
Showin’ off big spendin’, letting alcohol spill
I feel she might just get too faded
X-rated that's what I like glad that you made
To this ceremony at hand, take a sip lets plan
For the future, introduce you to Snoop get you right and

May I, kick a little something for the G's and
Make a few ends as I breeze through?
The shit on my hip is a fucking preview
And guess what it lead to

If you got drugs in this motherfucker
Let me see your hands in the air

And we ain't 'bout all that talkin', you a dead man walking
Stomp a nigga ass out, in these number 4 Jordans
Got a scope on the barrel that's a hammer with a camera
Hollow tips nigga, tip a nigga like a dancer
I don't know nothing but bitches and gettin' money
Blood gang, kill a nigga in public
Young Tunechi
Shoot a nigga ass up then it's Deuces
Headshots that fucking vest is so useless
Yeah, yo chuck, fuck these niggas
You know who, P-I-RU, killer bees nigga

"My Bitch (50 Cent, Jay-Z and Suge Knight Diss)",The Street King,UnKnown,"Let me tell you a story about this bitch I know
Grew up on the south side sucking dicks for dough
Give her a half a dollar, she'll put on a show
Do anything to be in a Dr. Dre video
The bitch went Hollywood
One trip to the West Coast
She got fucked by this white bitch had her legs wide open
As long as my pockets were fat
I didn't give a fuck where the bitch was at
My pretty young thing keep my nuts drained
But all the time she was plotting on my Aftermath chain
Bitch couldn't stay in her lane
Started running with this ho from the south
Gold grill in her mouth
She put her on the track
Gave her her first thong
Introduced her to her two girlfriends from back home
Fucked the industry, tryna take the fast route
Ran into a gangster and he turned they ass out


From the projects hustled all day
Niggas called her Sophie from around the way
Used to play hard to get so they thought she was gay
Bougie bitch who ever thought she was raised in B.K
Moved out the hood
Changed her name to Jay
Told everybody she'll be working with a mill one day
I was introduced to her back in 96
She had a wavey haircut and some big ass lips
At first she was hard to hit
Come to find out the last ten years she been sucking Big dick
Got a family now
A house made of bricks
Four grown ass kids and ain't none of them shit
She still my bitch so I stayed around
But she always tryna dash when other dame's around
She tryna play The Game but I got the bitch number
She said she won't but she'll be back next summer


Last but not least my gangsta bitch
From Compton always in and out of jail and shit
Bitch tried to burn Snoop
Stole Chronic from Doc
Blew the whole West Coast, even tried to fuck Pac
Type of bitch to stand on Beverley Hills
Word on the street she got a few real niggas killed
I look up now she on my dick
Telling me how she always gonna be my bitch
Pop up at award shows always following me
Bitch doing dumb shit, got a college degree
No pre-nupt, one nigga got stick with her
I was smart knew always not to fuck with her
What goes around comes around, scandolous shit
Somebody tried to kill that bitch
Burned the bridges and ain't had one friend left
Niggas that know her called her the devil in that red dress",https://genius.com/The-game-my-bitch-50-cent-jay-z-and-suge-knight-diss-lyrics
California Dream,The R.E.D. Album,2011.0,"I'm at the house 'bout to roll this kush up
I can get a call at any minute, so I'm just doing push-ups
Waiting on what seems to be forever
I burned a hole in my Polo sweater cause I was nervous
But that's how crazy birth is, loading up this Beretta
Cause this time I'm having a baby girl
So it's whatever, whenever.. whatever
You my willow and it's my will to make this last forever
First thing I'mma tell her, daddy's your umbrella
Get with a glass slipper Cali, you my Cinderella
Gotta be a dream, hold up, that's your middle name
Both your brothers big now, so baby you my little Game
Who gon be the Godfather? Swizz? Lil Wayne?
AR smoke too much but got Cali tatted on his veins
And I just got a text from your mama
Saying the water burst, I guess it's time for my karma

Walk through the door, she on the ground crying
She don't wanna get up, you had a baby right here
I ain't cleaning that shit up!
I finally got her out the house, now we on the elevator
She screaming, I left the car seat
But I'mma tell her later
Aww forget the car seat, man I'm hella-faded
She like ""I know you ain't high"" shit, I celebrated
Now we in the car, she won't put on her seatbelt
Screaming at the top of her lungs, ""God, I need help""!
Weaving through traffic, minutes between contractions
Close your eyes right now, and you can see it happening
Imagine, she pulling on me ""stop I'm about to crash, shit!""
Butterflies in my stomach, heart beating fast as shit
Every time I have a kid, it's like the first time
Kids the best, but they be coming at the worst times
Now we here, 
Tiff
 get in the wheelchair
Them butterflies still here. Am I happy? Hell yeah!

I parked the car, now I'm running through the halls lost
Trying to figure out which one of these rooms is ours
Think, think damn, one of the nurses stuck they head out
They gave her an epideral so I pulled the couch bed out
Took a nap, woke up, they almost got the head out
She grabbing on the rails, looking like she 'bout to pass out
Told her to breathe, grab my phone and hit record
""Breathe! 1, 2, 3, 4 - one more - 2, 3, 4""
Push! C'mon Tig, push! God damn it, just push!""
Nurse Linda coaching her, doctor arm a pulling on shoulders
Giving me the notion to cut the umbilical cord
She out, 8 pounds 4 ounces, sayin' stop the beat
Hold up, I'm about to make a announcement
See, every time a child is born somebody leave the world
So I thank the woman that gave her life for my baby girl",https://genius.com/The-game-california-dream-lyrics

Lamborghini merci beaucoup, mwah!
Couldn't do it without Jesus
Got a passport fuck I need with a visa?
Got a black card fuck I need with a Visa?
I don’t fuck with 'Bron but got on them south beaches


Pull up, holy ghost, they have seizures
Hop out, gun smoke, the gat sneezes
Niggas see me in real life say ""oh Jesus!""
Might just save your life and not squeeze it
Heathen ain't supposed to be breathing
The hood crucify me came back as black Jesus
Audemar shitting on niggas, that's feces
Brown Mase tangerine guts, that's Reese's
Tune on the album ain't have to pay for the feature

Like 3 o'clock in the morning, stop my car, let the top down
Don't nobody know I'm there, just reminiscing 'bout the days when we used to be in Larry Nickel's crack spot, with my brother Fase
King Frog, Squid, Big Dan, D-Bo, B-Los
Back when Lil' Frogg and Badass they was lil niggas
Lil wild niggas running round the hood
My nigga Slim 'Ru is in the joint doing ten
That's my solid nigga, on Bloods, my nigga Peanut, he in jail now
My lil' cousin Damo and my homeboy Buddha-Ru, this Cedar block

I remember days like this, my nigga
We was tripping 'cause we hated Crips, my nigga
Shooting out of six trays and shit, my nigga
He was slipping so we sprayed his six, my nigga
I done seen some brazy shit, my nigga
A kid shot cause he raised his fist, my nigga
Fiends stealing 'cause they can't get a fix, my nigga
Sharing needles, passing AIDS and shit, my nigga
It's fucked up but I was raised in this, my nigga
Been smoking purple haze since six, my nigga
And my moms wasn't no lazy bitch, my nigga
I seen her hustle that's what made me rich, my nigga
But all this shit is overrated that's why I don't give a fuck no more
I don't want this Benz or this truck no more
I started off doing this shit 'cause I love this shit, Blood
Seeing the homie slap box, I love this shit, Blood
Sitting in my Impala like I love this shit, Blood
Weren't never 'bout a dollar, I just love this shit, Blood
Scrapping after school, Compton High wasn't bool
Could have went to Centennial but I love this shit, Blood
Used to bang Quik, yeah I love this shit, Blood
Mausberg was sick and I love this shit, Blood
Then I gave Wacko my demo outside of Food 4 Less
He came back in ten minutes like ""I love this shit, Blood""
West side Piru, I love this shit Blood
Elm street to the Fruits yeah I love this shit, Blood
Crip neighborhoods too, even though they blue
Compton is where we grew and I love this shit, Blood

I done seen some brazy shit, my nigga
I done seen some brazy shit, my nigga
I done seen some brazy shit, my nigga
I done took some fades with Crips, my nigga
My own homies did some shady shit, my nigga
But that's the shit that made me this, my nigga

All my life's been so complicated
But I will never turn my back on Compton
Our shit is so overrated
But I will never change who I am
So I'm riding for Compton
I ride, I ride, I ride, I ride for Compton

Every bi-week, shit, I'm bound to buy a car
Murder-cedes Benz or that bubble double R
Headlights flicking, looking like a falling star

I'm 'bout to tear this fucking track out
Pretend that it's Keri Hilson and blow her fucking back out
22nd mixtape, half of 'em diss tapes
But fuck who I was dissing cause I never made a mistake
Bleek got what he deserved, Jay, I might have been tripping
I was falling, I was slipping, he was Jordan, I thought I was Pippen
He was winning, I was losing, he threw a jab, I start bruising
So I threw in the towel just to separate all confusion
Ivy Blue is beautiful, me saying that's unusual
That's just the father in me, don't think I'm trying to be cool with you
Thug life, Rihanna knuckles, Gucci shirt, designer buckles
Louis Vuitton billboard, the niggas that's just trying to hustle
Poster boy for them drug dealers, I just want y'all to love me
But I ain't the Feds, so I ain't really trying to bug niggas
Y'all the Verizon man, I'm just gon' stand behind y'all
But every now and then, I gotta remind y'all


It's that red bottom boss, nigga
Burgundy Bentley truck, who give a fuck what it cost nigga
That V12 start up like Ross nigga
That's why them hoes call me the boss nigga
Catch me in the Maybach where them seats recline way back
Remember, I had a Rocky for ya, I ain't talking ASAP
Know I got that K strap, chopper with the base hat
If you see tip drilling, King of Diamonds, tell I got like eight stacks
Ace of Spades by the crates, biatch
Never lose, like Alexander the Great, biatch
I only win like Baylor, I run the city like mayors
Don't make me go dig up them old Chuck Taylor's
Back when me and Snoop was the only ones throwing up gang signs
Y'all niggas wasn't bloods until I came and cosigned y'all
But y'all the Verizon man, I'm just gon' stand behind y'all
And sometimes I gotta remind y'all

Taylor Gang nigga, I ain't Wiz doe
But I got that yellow brick road inside my ear lobes
Playing ice hockey, feeling like Gretzky
Los Angeles King, and I'm who my city gon' cheer for
Niggas throwing subliminals, act like I don't hear those
I could give you 600 bars, but y'all know that y'all fear those
And plus I'm too attached to my lifestyle
Fuck them Air 1's, I'm too attached to these spikes now
Louboutins, hard as croutons
They comfortable like futons, they suede, grey poupon
They yellow like Luke on the Lakers, he was traded
But they should have moved that nigga marrying Gloria Govan
Damn, was that too strong, these niggas getting pooped on

I got my Aftermath Chain, I iced out the A
I stayed on some gangsta shit but still bump that De La
Dippin' down Green Leaf, Cherry Six Tre
I felt like I ain't need your love, wrote the song ""Hittin' Switches"", then I recorded the shit with Faith
I did the BET Awards with Mary J
I stayed on top of California like the bay niggas

Had a dream that I did some more G Shit with Nate Dogg

Feelin' like the old Suge, me and my city both good
I understand I've been misunderstood
Niggas hate me cause they wishin' they could

Keepin' they bitches in missionary positions now look

Niggas feel my pain, I make it rain without the strippers
Go against the grain, and push your shit back like some clippers

Don't turn me down, turn me up every time them cops pass
Mashed on the gas, am I getting high, don't even ask
Cause I got another ounce up in the stash
Them boys want they music on blast
Don't turn me down, turn me up every time them cops pass
Mashed on the gas, am I getting high, don't even ask
Cause I take 2 hits, and then I pass

I see the cops in the rearview, why can't a motherfucker chill in the car
Feelin' like Missy, why you all up in my grill

Camouflage by the Armor All while it's sparkling off my wheels
And I fuck hoes that prey on Dwight Howard and Shaquille

And you say to yourself ""He's broke""
Well how the hell am I ballin', like Spalding
I did a couple of movies, now agents calling and calling
Can't get to the phone right now cause balls is all in this bitch mouth
When did we start taking these tricks out?
Now she gon' run her big mouth and tell her girlfriend
You had her all up in the wind
Blowing yo cheese on Louboutins, and now that bitch is in the wind
And after the next draft, she gon' start that cycle again
How you claimin' that bitch when she with him?

You can embrace it or come face to face with total devastation
My mojo is never fadin', I'm in my Optimus Prime transform
Switch it up, heat it up, speed it up, that means I'm gone
Light years, ahead of your Buzz, Toy Story and club songs
Boy, gone, the A-T-L-iens are phoning home
But I feel like a librarian, cause style's are being' loaned out like books
A castle full of crooks, rape and pillage
They'll do anything for money, I bet misleading the village


Not from New England, but I pack a patriot
Not from Atlanta, but I got the cater
Not from Chicago, but I'm a bear
I'm a bay area nigga, 49er, Raider
I'm about my bread man, I ain't no sucker
Now these bitch ass niggas soft as table butter
I'm about my riches, magazines, street hustler
You can ask your uncles, daddies, mothers, and your older brothers
But I used to flea flick that yola white
Sellin' that shit below the retail price
I'm a rare breed like the bike club, get it right
Desperado like Toriono, shout out to Dynamite

Stripper,Sunday Service,2012.0,"She got two jobs, work late, college courses on her plate
Never give head on the first date, always fighting in the workplace
She a stripper (stripper), she a stripper (stripper)
Them high heels, that black lace, that long weave and that fuck face
That pink thong and that slim waist, that fat pussy with that fruit taste
She a stripper (stripper), she a stripper (stripper)
I knew Maliah before Maliah went to H-Town and that’s straight up
And that’s straight down like that front do’
Ain’t see that ass in a month though, Drake talking ‘bout her
Make a nigga mad, you heard that song? Yeah, best that he ever had
She got hips like the kit on that Challenger, she got horsepower
Need stamina, Nicole Michael ain’t no amateur, I tell you boy
She standing up, two legs and a pole, tri-pod, no hands, my god
She pop that pussy, UGK on that I-Pod, she got a dragon over that left cheek
She know Drake, she know me, had Sean Kingston in that trick bag
Had the little nigga down on one knee, need a real nigga
She don’t fuck free, I’m Jesus Piece, she’ll fuck me
Her co-workers discuss me but they all wanna fuck, trust me

She a stripper (stripper), she a stripper (stripper)
She a stripper (stripper), she a stripper (stripper)

My niggas in the pen got posters on the wall
Close your eyes tight enough, you see tip drill fall
Two ass cheeks like bowling balls
Tell her bounce that pussy up off the wall
Picture me taking them panties off
She got an ass like a rhino and it's soft
She like a real hood nigga but her man is soft
Money take away the pain like Anbesol
When she on the strip pole, it’s like Mardi Gras
That girl built like she from Arkansas, that pussy fat like a monkey jaw
Only bitches like me that I already saw
She started off in Miami, moved up to that A-Town
Make it rain like Skittles in that candy shop
It’s her birthday, she getting cake now
Take it back down on to M.I.A, my little redbone
She the Queen of Diamonds, pop that pussy
Tryna get that pay, bitch almost died from that pole climbing
I admire the way she take care of son
So tell the waitress to take care of ones
Send flowers to the hospital in February
She been my favorite dancer since day one


She the reason we all here, she the reason they all stare
People ask her government, her phone number or if it’s all real
I ain’t concerned with that now, I got a jar of that loud
I got a thing for that body baby and these dollars cover your ground
Realest niggas in town, Chuck scoop, we all LAX
I’m in the Lambo, sipping on brown, that’s the highness way be on Crown
And I got the stadium clout where it gets Palladium wild
Pimp mack be crazy if I get the lady, know I tap, see the lady be on styles
That liquor talking and that zip is talking, bands a make her dance
What she gonna do if I Woodstock it?
My favorite stripper although I got some options
My niggas caught me in the club, they telling me I got a problem

On the first day, he said let there be light
The second day, he made you baby, you baby
Oooh and I just can’t contain myself
The way you move so fucking edible, mmm incredible baby
And I can’t stop catching the Holy Ghost from watching you baby
Oooh baby, the way you make me feel is so incredible
The therapy is what I need, incredible, the therapy is sweet to me
And I can’t stop dropping my check off in this club for you baby, oooh oooh baby",https://genius.com/The-game-stripper-lyrics
Don’t Worry,The Documentary,2005.0,"Can't wait 'til we make real love
Because these conjugal visits just ain't enough
I'm really looking forward to a future for us
Baby don't worry 'bout it
I'mma beeee right here, waitin on you
Even took a second job
So they won't take the clause and put a lean on the
House
I know it's gonna be a while before you get out, ooh
Baby don't worry 'bout it (don't worry)
I'mma beeee right here, waitin on you
And them dudes you ran with are foul
They been tryna get at me, ever since you been down
Even my girls are tellin me, I should end it all now
Baby don't worry about it
I'mma be {*cell door slams*}

All I can think about is that honey complexion
And the way your skin glow when you slippin on them Dior dresses
I know you wonderin why I got you a Smith 'n Wesson
Cause them niggas in the hood is the reason we stressin
I miss that gangsta love and that lil' affection
Them butter soft lips when you kissin my chest and
Mary I put nuttin above you
And behind that vest I got a heart ma gangstas need love too

Some think the worst of you
They portray you as a man, it's not that far from the truth
You were caught up in the game and now it's, caught up to you
Baby don't worry about it
I'mma be right here, waitin' on you

It used to be caramel skin tones, Sprewell rims on
Glass house, ass out, Jacob watch, gemstones
Bandanna, Nike Airs, tennis bracelet, wife hair
Black rag, do or die, .45 right here
Every time I was down, you was always right there
Whenever visitin hours came, I know my wife there
So pink diamonds right here, chain hang, ice there
The reason for my tattooed tear - I need you to hold me down

I'll be waiting on you (I'lllllll)
I'll be waiting on you (I'ma be right here whenever you call me babe)
I'll be waiting on you (ooooh-ohh)
Baby don't worry about it
I'mma be right here, waitin on you

I'm locked up countin the days down
Tryna hold my head cause the penitentiary ain't no playground
I'm dyin in here and I don't know how you stay down
In the shootin range twice a week bustin that trey-pound
I would never ask you to wait around
But how do a white sandy beach in St. Tropez sound?
And no more outta town trips on that Greyhound
Just me hittin like a beat from Dr. Dre, out

I'll be waiting on you (I'll be waiting)
I'll be waiting on you (I'ma be right here, for you baby)
I'll be waiting on you (I'll)
Baby don't worry about it (don't worry babe)

I'll be waiting on you (I'ma be right here waitin for you baby)
I'll be waiting on you (you know I-hiiiiiii will)
I'll be waiting on you (whenever you need me baby)
Baby don't worry about it (I'll be right here, I'll be right here)
I'mma beeee right here, waitin on you (don't you worry)
I'm lookin for a future with you baby
Wanna see you real soon, real soon, real soon

Niggas is crazy, dog
I run this underground rap shit, and the mainstream, nigga!
I'ma do like Boo-Boo: diss niggas right when they fuckin' album come out... and kill 'em!

Hear the breakdown, time to separate the men from the boys
Take it straight to the bank; call it Christopher Lloyd
Call it momma's little boy, or 50's little bitch
The Rotten Apple or the protégé of a snitch
The protégé of a bitch, nigga softer than a Tae Bo Kick
You Billy Blanks on them porno flicks
With no porno chicks, only porno dicks
You Ty Lattimore whore with them g-string drawers
And so therefore, I declare war
Outside violator, meet me at four
Young Buck, stay back; Banks, put this autograph
A Jorge Posada glove on, and let's play catch!

(Gunshot) That's for your one platinum plaque
(Gunshot) That's for the niggas ridin' in the back
(Gunshot) Tryna reach for that shit on your lap
(Gunshot) That's for your boss sayin' he write my raps (Gunshot) I'm a killa, Blackwall Gorilla
That pine-box sealer, G-Unit cap peeler
I'm realer, 40 oz. spiller
40 Glock killer, 40 Glocc killer!

Ask Spider, I be creepin’ and crawlin’
Spinnin' webs around you niggas
Stackin' bread around you niggas
Every time you roll up, the feds around you niggas
I used to watch everything I said around you niggas
Twenty niggas on the squad, twenty niggas in the can
That's twenty witnesses, twenty niggas on the stand
Goddamn, can someone tell them the street code?!
The Game is to be sold, and not to be told
This ain't Dre and Suge or Beans and Hov
This is one bullet, one head, and one lost soul
Wipe my fingerprints off
And the gun is tossed in with the fishes
Like Q in Juice, I'm comin' for Bishop
I'm gunnin' for Bishop, I'm the king of this L.A. shit
Tell me, homie, is you Blood or Crip?
Is you thug or bitch? ‘Cause the ese's say
They don't never see holmes runnin' around L.A
Fake-ass ghostwriter, get your lil' flow tighter
'Fore I put you in the trunk of this fuckin' low-rider
Nigga, you ain't nothin' but Hittman in quicksand
Got a deal, ‘cause you sucked a couple dicks, and
Turned your back on Delany and Jimmy Henchman
Just take this as a warning; don't flinch, man!
Where your rag? You from 1-9-0? No!
You know Pap, do you bang East Coast? No!
Have you ever hopped 1-6-4? No!
Do the hood feel your wack-ass flow? No!
So sit your lil' ass down somewhere
'Fore I have them niggas sit yo' ass down somewhere
In the ground somewhere, outta town somewhere
Breaking news: body has been found somewhere
Now back to the video, look at these silly muh'fuckers
Y'all some silly muh'fuckers
""I say, hands up, shorty wanna kick it with me.""
Get that wack shit of BET
Turn the channel, all Black Lambo, red and black flannel
Speakers in the trunk, with more humps than a camel
Man, I'm sayin', I ain't playin', I'm sprayin'
Any nigga in your clique that ever yelled that shit

(Gunshot) Muh'fucker, that's for Yayo and Buck
(Gunshot) That's for Hot Rod promotional truck
(Gunshot) That's for Kanye, and beefin' with Puff
(Gunshot) Tell the nigga that's behind you to duck!

Any clip filler, Mobb Deep cap peeler
I'm realer, the hollow-tip driller
The rap Godzilla, the Lloyd Banks killer! (Gunshot)

In the diablo, under the tent
Nigga, I'm about a dollar, what the fuck is 50 Cent?
When Jay said it, I didn't know what it meant
Now I understand, it's startin' to make sense
Now the whole world know why I took the I out of G-Unit
And replaced it with a mothafuckin' O
Remember when you told me meet you on the top, nigga?
Check the soundscan, guess who on top, nigga!
Fake-ass king of New York, you need to stop, nigga
‘Cause you not Big, not Nas, not Jigga
Take your steroids, show me what you got, nigga!
You ain't had a bitch since Vivica Fox, nigga
Last I heard, you sucking on cocks, nigga
Nobody know, ‘cause they don't see you on the blocks, nigga
‘Cause you be in the precinct with the cops, nigga
Your whole staff, with a badge and a Glock nigga
Mid-town Manhattan, tryna stop niggas
On the subway, chasing down shop-lifters
All in the streets, talking 'bout you shot niggas
Then you in The New York Times, takin' cop pictures
I exposed you niggas and put out ""Stop Snitchin'""
When the last time you seen him with some hot bitches?
See what he say when you ask him, ""Where the hot bitches?""
Check the adam's apple, nigga, them is not bitches
You're reign on the top was shorter than the legs on a leprechaun; just bow down, nigga, accept the Don
Nobody wanna be a hero when the TEC is drawn
They're transformers, folding up, like decepticons
Niggas bust like pipes when the pressure on
See that light flash when the Desert Eagle at your dome
Every rapper know, from now I'ma set the tone
Niggas real hard body 'til they head is gone
Here come them demons
‘Cause they know that you dead and gone
Some niggas just don't get it 'til you at the throne

Niggas can't fuck with me nigga! 100 Bars, nigga!
I do 100 bars every mothafuckin' day of the week, nigga!
That's 700 bars a week, nigga!
On this fuckin' underground rap shit, nigga!
I can't be fuckin' stopped—period, nigga!
The Game, nigga! West Coast Don, Black Wallstreet, nigga!
I'm ready to get down when you ready to get down
Mothafuckas! I'm talkin' to all you niggas!
I can't be faded, nigga! Niggas don't want it with me, nigga!
It's just me, mothafuckas! And I'm pissed off
Got me all on the front of the motherfuckin' mixtape
In a fuckin' stripper outfit, nigga, with some G-string's on
That ain't me, mothafuckas! This is me, mothafuckas!
Yeah! Doctor's Advocate, in stores November 7th
Cop it when I drop it, nigga!

I empty the clip and lay you in a pool of

Blood, bandana that’s how we be movin’
Blood, swooping from Compton to Brooklyn

It's a trap, it's a trap
Why they ain't tell us red and blue don't matter when you black?
Matter of fact we in blindfolds, bunch of lost souls
Kids shot dead in the streets, now they eyes closed
How you call the angels when it's kings getting beat up?
And Gil Garcetti in his office with his feet up
No way to dodge police brutality
Sellin' crack cocaine, makin' a teacher's salary
Mexicans hoppin' the borders in the thousands
Become cholos, one button Pendletons, they stylin'
Crips on the corner in Dodger blue with they gold chains
Bloods sportin' corn rows and Chucks with the red strings
Sun goin' down so them Chevys 'bout to roll out
Fiends scratchin' themselves, stumblin' out the dope house
Niggas tyin' bandanas, 'bout to put the drum on
Kids tryna make it home 'fore street lights come on

The way we live is savage
The way we live is savage
The way we live is savage
The way we live is savage

So grab that gun, load that clip
Grab that torch, light that shit, grab that stick
Grab that brick, throw it. it's time to riot
If you don't see black owned in the window, it's on fire
Start here, end up over there
The smell of gun powder in the air
And just so we clear, this is pain and despair
We burn our own shit and we aware and don't care
Tell the national guards to disappear
We got guns too and we ain't scared
So fuck the man, fuck the President Bush and his legislation
Shit gotta change, we ain't waitin', fuck patience
'Cause the government corrupt, I can prove it
Martin, Malcolm, Huey P. Newton
And that's why the whole city out here lootin'
How can we stand here and not do shit?
All this smoke over the hood lookin' like low clouds
Cars with no miles on fire, they broke down
White people wishin' that they was at home
Asians frontin' like they business is Black-owned
Far from stupid, we comin' in the stores trippin'
Runnin' in swap meets for they Jordans and they Pippins
Crowbars, bats, anythin' that break glass
They fucked Rodney King up and now it's they ass
So it's bottle rockets through the window
Kids that was never smokin' endo
Fiends kickin' in doors, stealin' Nintendos
Niggas robbin' liquor stores with taped up ""Duck Hunt"" guns
City burnin' but it's fucked up fun
National Guard's on the corner
They don't know the hood, they foreigners
We was bustin' at the cops before Chris Dorner
Ghetto birds flyin' over the hood, they see us
Showin' the fuck out, cleanin' the trucks out
Niggas mobbin' down the streets pushin' big screens and baskets
Starin' straight into the cameras, no ski mask
Just pandemonium, niggas lootin' what they homies in
Runnin' around with Scarface guns like they was Tony and them
Who, what, where, when, how the fuck they gon' stop us?
When the last 50 years we accustomed to window shoppin'
So we takin' lighters to the tip of magazines
Dip 'em in gasoline and set this motherfucker on (fire)

When my mother told me sit in the van, nah fuck that
Foot Locker chained up, wire cutters cut that
Niggas Crip walkin' where Reginald Denny's truck at
Police cars, drivin' by niggas in slow mo
If you white don't stop at the light, 'cause that's a no-no
Runnin' through the malls, give us everything Polo
The first time niggas ain't have beef with the cholos
'92, fire lit the skyline, and why we loot?
To capture that forbidden truth 'cause Adam never ate the fruit
Fuck your blue suits, your badge, and them high beams
We out here sellin' chronic, we ain't have no Jimmy Iovines
Shit burnin', you gon' need more than Visine
We makin' a movie better than any one that I've seen
Should be on Showtime, HBO, Cinemax
Get a match, we gon' make sure that y'all remember that (Fire)

Not to down Eminem, I fuck black bitches
Fuck white bitches, nigga, I like bitches
Them half-and-half Alicia {Keys} dyke bitches
If the head right I might Air Nike bitches
Or put 'em on the track like Just Blaze
I look down on hoes and look up to Dre
'Cause ain't

No more fun and games!
Gangsta, gangsta!
That's what they're yellin'
It's not about a salary, it's all about reality
I ain't gotta tell you this but one mo' time
Leroy!
Now pay attention

I'm like Dre, Eazy, Cube, King Tee and Ren rolled in one
Used to move birdies 'til I put a hole in one
Nigga that thought I wasn't holdin a gun
And tried to ride up on me like Afeni Shakur's only son
Dre told me he ain't doin' Detox, this his only run
Ma$e comin back, and Hov, he done
I'm surrounded by legends, sittin' at the round table
I am The Game, and still niggas tryna play dude
I'm ruthless, I ain't talkin' 'bout the label
I'll hook niggas up, and I don't mean free cable
I mean I'll hook niggas up to them IV's
The same way Dre hooked me up to Iovine
I'm from the gutter, grew up in public housing
On the same block with a shack like Yao Ming
So if a nigga ever try to Jerry Heller me
Tell Dre put up a mill, cause that's what my bail'll be

No more fun and games!
Gangsta, gangsta!
That's what they're yellin'
It's not about a salary, it's all about reality
Nigga, I just came out the hole, I done did my time
Nigga, what you know about time?

I've been rappin' for one year, one month, 17 days
13 hours, 28 minutes, then I met Dre
30 minutes after I bought the new Em
That was November 18th, 3:09 PM
Around the same time, ""Wanksta"" got it's first spin
That was 32 weeks before they signed Rakim
Eight months, 13 days before I knew a Mike Len
And three years after Mason Betha turned his mic in
I started writin' 22 months and 20 weeks prior
To LeBron shakin' Adidas for Nikes
I'm right here, six years after Randy Moss
Caught his first touchdown for the Vikings
Just one day, seven hours, 14 minutes
21 seconds before SoundScan got printed
Two platinum records 'fore I'm classified with Biggie
And two seconds before the song finish, yeah",https://genius.com/The-game-no-more-fun-and-games-lyrics
Young Niggas,1992,2016.0,"Ray Ray: So what's up Lil J?
Lil J: We down Ray Ray
Ray Ray: So what set you claiming?
Lil J: Claiming Hoover and South Shores
We down with 32's in most quads, straight like that
Ray Ray: Straight like that huh?

We grew up as friends, we was 10, lil' niggas on the block
He ain't have his own basketball, so we shared my rock
His mama was a fiend, he ain't heard from his pops
He used to share my clothes with him all the way down to his socks
He would spend the night, that one night would turn into a week
At least until his mama got back on her feet and she never did
So he moved in with me, my mama, and my sisters
Couldn't let him go to foster care 'cause she ain't trust the system
So she took care of him like he was me
Gave us everythin' she could back when shit was all good

Just some young niggas
We was just some young niggas
We was just some young niggas

Niggas turned 12 in '92, we was headed to the 7th grade
Runnin' 'round, stealin' cars, dreamin' about the better days
Duckin' strays, catchin' fades, tryna make it through this maze
Teachers out here smokin' J's and wonder why we misbehave
Same book, different page, another year, different age
Cross colors, colors cross, bows turnin' into fades
He started Crippin', I started Bloodin'
Now we walkin' through the halls of school like we don't even know each other
Young niggas

Young niggas, out in these streets
We was just some young niggas
All in these streets to feed
Young niggas
Lord knows I don't want no enemies, yeah
Young niggas in these, ohh

Started off as brothers but sometimes shit fall apart
How can I hate this nigga with all this love up in my heart
With this nigga mean muggin' every time we in the class
Nigga tuck that blue rag or I'ma beat your fuckin' ass
Guess my mind gone
Caught him after school, he ain't had no ride home
Still got that rag hangin', that's what got him fired on
He pulled the strap, so I pistol whipped him with the chrome
Wasn't tryna kill him, coulda pulled the trigger, I was just a
Young nigga

I was just a young nigga

Whopped my nigga ass, he ain't take it on the chin
Rumor startin' to spread, I guess it's on when I see him
Two weeks pass and graduation came around
I was walkin' through the choir, .45 under my gown
Had to take a leak, so I headed to the bathroom
Corner of my eye, seen him comin' out of the class room
We exchange words, so I cocked the 45th
He shot, I shot back, thank God I ain't get hit
But damn I miss my young nigga

From a ese, nigga I could write an essay
About all the gangsta niggas that I seen lowridin
In they Chevys with a bitch riding shotgun reppin L.A
Crips, Bloods, homes going loco

Sitting in a low-low, on chrome spinners
Nobody drop nothing this winter, nigga I'm from


Nigga I smoke chronic, ain't shit changed
Since Young MC and Eazy-E was rapping ""We All in the Same Gang""
Some niggas chain hang, other niggas gangbang
I do both cause I'm the king of the motherfucking West coast
Kick the door open, Will let's go
Flow like Esco', New York niggas say I'm the best yo
Hard like Timbos, blowing on indo
Niggas try to play me, get stretched out like a limo
I was chopping crack when Dre was banging my demo
And all you old niggas is washed up like N.O
Don't take it the wrong way, I got love for my kinfolk
Can I get a moment of silence
 Will bang the instrumental
I spit for my niggas in the line-up
That'll never see the sun again, so I close my blinds up

I'm sick, you can't get rid of me, I'm HIV
Nigga get another job, hip-hop is not hiring
I'm the reason Dre feel comfortable retiring
I just might put out ""Detox"" myself
Smoke so much, I check in detox myself
One man army, took out Reeboks myself
45. in my khakis gotta watch my health

Only Kanye and Cameron knows
And who this Tammy ho? Telling her me and Tre are shooting a video
In a month and she can get a cameo
SMH. TTM. Five star
We be em. LOL, hi my BBM ain't got my BBM
Louis Vuiton he be in, 'tron got him queasy
And my money ain’t young, ask my nigga Little Weezy and 'em
I keep one rolled like Wiz Khalifa and 'em
Got some college hoes that wanna smoke a Swisher Sweet with him
They ain't no Lauren Londons but they got that Meagan Goode
They use that Photoshop to get their ass up out the hood
And it’s all good when us niggas mayne
I said it’s all good cause I am with Trigga, man
Yeah, she said she wanna have Jayceon kid
I told that bitch you better off with Jason Kidd

I do it cause they love it
If you hate it bitch who give a fuck, I made it
Plus I do it for the ladies
Somebody say they wanna have my baby
She said she wanna have my baby
Who tryna have my baby?
She said she wanna have my baby
Tryna have my baby
How many bitches in the club just trying to fuck a platinum rapper
Poking microscopic holes into the magnum wrappers
Hopping on the dick but I ain't throwing carrots at ya
You ain't gonna Worldstar me, I ain’t your average rapper
You drinking all the Goose & bitch I ain’t fittna pay
You don't look like your Twitter avatar any way
Bitch you look like an Avatar anyway
And that’s the same bitch that was stalking Fab, ain’t it Tre?
And this is how I know you giving free head
If you was getting paid the bottom of your shoe would be red
But it ain’t, she claiming she a saint
But as soon as she sees Dwight she going hard in the paint
Girlfriend-type you wanna take home
Throw a little Drake on, it really shouldn't take long
Then she told me she want me & Tre Songz
I told that bitch ""strip, and start singing all Tre's songs""

I do it cause they love it
If you hated bitch fuck cause I made it
I do it for the ladies
Somebody say they wanna have my baby
She said she wanna have my baby
I am trying to have my baby
She said she wanna have my baby
I am trying to have my baby

You look much better than your friend
Just for the night let me be your boyfriend
With that baby, let's go
Ain't no sense in waiting on me
Nobody that I know, they don't be debating on it
They gon' say we did it, even though we didn't
I'mma play cool, interviews, say I didn’t

Looking for a night out and they both came back to me

I heard a couple lil' niggas got life today
Is it Farrakhan, Buddha, or Christ today?
She on her knees so she know what it's like to pray
She got religious so she doin' it twice a day
I strap up, no I ain't throwin' dice today
When you got money on yo' head it's a price to pay
And it get cold in the hood, put your ice away
They locked Rick Ross up and they ain't give him no bail
But a cracker shoot a whole church up and it's ""Oh well""
Oh well, oh well
Hang him with a confederate flag in his cell
Let him sit there and rot 'til his body turns to bones
Just remember who casted the first stone

Say hi to the Chi, celebrate with the Bay
No hesitation like Steph, shoot it right in your face
'Cause I'm a Golden State warrior strapped with a K
How's it land of the free, when we're trapped in a cage?
Some shit just never make sense like Magic and AIDS
Some shit just never make sense like bashin' the gays
Obama must be in the city, it's traffic today
Niggas trappin' today just like back in the day
We like Roc-A-Fella Records, we packagin' yay
And that Dirty Sprite 2 shit slappin' today
We got these niggas boxed in like Cassius Clay
And my Ferragamo belt where that ratchet stay

Who gon' blast today? Who gon' have to pray?""

You would understand why I wanted inside that hole too
You ain't even give me a hug or a pound yet
Askin' for money, daddy ain't even in the ground yet
That ain't what bros do
How you spend your whole life with a stranger you call your brother that don't know you?
2006 Bentley coupe parked at Nobu
I was your bulletproof vest when them Crips tried to smoke you
Shit be hurtin' my heart so I approached you
We on the same team but you think I'm tryna coach you
I was in first class, I looked back
You was mad so I gave up my seat and sat in coach too
Here's somethin' to toast to
I bought the weed, the blunts, you smoked that and the roach too

When the fuck you get soft
And start talkin' behind my back like baby mamas when they pissed off?
I couldn't fuck with your energy when the shits off
Hate it or love it video inside that '64
Me and 50 was the twin towers
You hit us from the inside and watch both them shits fall

You ain't patch the bullet holes in my Mercedes Benz

Sub woofers in the trunk kickin' that

A hood nigga lost with no direction
So he bought a black Smith & Wesson
Strapped on his vest and that's his protection
At the intersection waitin' on the rival
Cause in the city of Angels, it's all about survival

Jumped in my Impala, took a trip to the swap meet
To scoop up ""Ego Trippin"" and some white T's

And life ain't nothin but TEC-9's and dirt
Dippin through the the jungles
, my escalade hit a dip
Fuck! Here come the gorillas in the mist
And they dressed like Ice Cube was in 96
Stone cold jheri curls and not one drip

Niggas tried to straight up jack me, now they both dead
Third little nigga got away on his moped
Caught him 'round the corner, put the beam on his forehead
Jumped in the Impala then smashed through the light
Without a one time in sight
So I bust a right on Century, headed to the L.A.X
Where there ain't nothin but fly bitches and jets
In and out of lanes and I almost wrecked
Off brand nigga in the 600 throwin up his set
He must don't know I got the 40 on deck
And the TEC tryna be Shabba Ranks, time to flex

The most recent was 50 in Angola, that's what's up
Any rapper can get touched, any bitch can get fucked
Under the California sun, Impalas and big trucks
They say Suge got knocked out, but don't play that nigga cheap
Cause your body might wash up by the courts of Venice Beach
Ain't shit sweet but my swisher, ain't shit buzzin but my liquor
Cali chickens go to the A to strip and come back a little thicker
With more ass than Deelishis, that's my Flavor of Love
We make it rain like Rain Man when he played with The Glove
I'm the King to you pawn niggas, Punisher, Spawn niggas
Playing in green, Paul Pierce to you LeBron niggas
We done barbeque, front and back lawn niggas
Summer Jam, throw your ass off stage, Akon niggas
We drink Kool-Aid with the ice on your arm nigga
Take that Champion hoodie off in the California Sunshine

I'm in my drop top Phantom, down Wilshire Boulevard
We can't find Biggie's killers so we gave Puffy a star
And I'm by far, Hollywood Boulevard
But I'm from a boulevard that taught y'all how to shoot out of moving cars
Remember ""New Jersey Drive"" was like an east coast Menace
And ""Belly"" was like the sequel without O-Dog in it
Give me a New York minute
To show you Cali got more dead bodies than the Yankees got New York pennants
Cause we Dodgers in Impalas with the windows tinted
I duck shots where Venus and Serena used to play tennis
And they never came back like throwing a boomerang flat
See me I'm posted like a Cincinnati pitcher in the same hat
It's like a scene from a movie, when the screen fade black
Niggas roll up on you, now you stuck in that Harold and Caine trap
If you slipping in Hollywood and you get your chain snatched
I know some niggas that owe some niggas, I'll get your chain back

California sunshine, in the summer time
California sunshine, in the summer time
California sunshine, in the summer time
California sunshine, in the summer time

Niggas already know who had the marijuana first
We birthed Haze and Sour Diesel, I was there when the water burst
Hell naw we don't surf, we halfway go to church
Tell you the truth, shit, right now I'm in a fucking hearse
And it ain't my night to get buried in the dirt
But it is your day to get buried by a verse
It'll be another 10 years 'fore you see a MC Ren here
Where he been I've been there, that Lambo I'm in there
Hotter than the beginning of my career with 50, Dre and Em there
Top off the Murcielago like Victoria's Secret swimwear
So listen I'm so sincere, 'bout to work out like gym wear
Murder MTV's Top 10 and tat my face with ten tears
That's ten funerals, ten caskets
Ten three-piece Ralph Lauren suits, ten motorbikes stopping traffic
And ten reasons why I got California hotter than acid
Don't you ever ever leave me out the Top 10, you fucking bastards

Here the breakdown
No 400 bars yet, I don't need that
I'm gas, your whole click is ass, I mean that
G-Unot cocksucker, better believe that
I say it one time, watch the whole world scream back
G-U-N-O-T, 
now that's for Billboard, rest in peace
And since my nigga died, I been stressed, no sleep
Contemplating suicide in my Lexus jeep
I tried twice but I couldn't make my death complete
I guess you could say Mýa got the best of me
Came back from the dead to address the beef
Kiss my Converse, bitch, and accept defeat
Cause I hate it when bullies try to test the weak
That's when I go Bishop in 
Juice
 and start flexin' heat
You could get it in the stomach just like Raheem
Cause runnin' with a snitch is not quite my thing
I tried to take Buck with me, but he stayed on the scene
Guess all I can do now is 
pray for Supreme
While I finish my next album, five million and countin'
Anticipating, tellin' the world I did it without him
If Aftermath was a family that didn't have a mother
I'd be Dre's newborn, you'd be the jealous older brother
Yea, daddy love us but in the meanwhile
You talkin' behind his back and in his face you smile
You moved out the house, you a failure now
And lil' Game grew up to be a problem child
I whip ya head boy, that's for Kanye West
I whip ya head boy, with the back of my tech
Yep, your fuckin' group fell flat without me
You mad, what you gonna do, rap about me?
Your bars is park garbage, hooks is mediocre
And your new shoes look like Reebok pennyloafers
Try to walk in my shoes a block
Hurricanes in stores the day after Christmas, nigga; fuck Reeboks
You a steroid addict, you need detox
Hopefully you make it out in time to be on 
Detox
Cause Black Wall Street expandin', yeah I bought three blocks
My CL so smooth, it should've came with Pete Rock
And let's not forget who made me hot
It was Dr. Dre that took me out the weed spot
You want credit, forget it, I did it on my own
Gave you 300 bars, then said I'm gone
But I'm back, this is rap and a fact is a fact
They say once you turn snitch, you never go back
Here's a picture of Ja Rule, motherfucker hold that
What goes around comes around
, get used to the gold plaques
Homie got cheese, but he don't feed no rats
I show the world my dick if 
Lloyd Banks go plat
I'm lyrically insane, Lloyd Banks know that
He told me I was like a Big Daddy Kane throwback
Started with one brick, built my own company
And don't spread news about it unless it come from me
Guess who's the boss, nigga my squad deep
But Glasses Malone is not signed to Black Wall Street
Nigga 
don't, don't, don't, don't, don't believe the hype
Hear that Mike?
And don't be alarmed, this is not a diss
But missusing my logo kinda got me pissed
And I got enough beef, 
now Lil' Eazy dissin
He don't write his own raps, so I gotta forgive him
I got love for ya pops and I always will
So on behalf of Eric Wright, my nigga you gotta chill
I'm the reason you new westcoast niggas got a deal
While I was doin mixtapes, they was watching College Hill
For real, you mothafuckas ain't got half my skill
I run this shit like OJ in pads for the bills
Trying so hard to be a gangsta, nigga you seethrough
Posing like 50 on the cover of the GQ
Button up shirt with the cut off sleeves
I got twin Desert Eagles, nigga suck on these
I got that CEO flow, yea my bars are sweet
Like Hova in Takeover, chewin' out Mobb Deep
Like Pac on Hit Em Up, chewin' out Mobb Deep
Don't one of you niggas got sickle? Fuck it, talk is cheap
When I see you, and I'm gonna see you
I'mma strip you down asshole naked and that's how I'mma leave you
Then I'mma find Havoc, make him walk through Queens nude
With Black Wall Street tattooed on his back
Nigga signed to G-unit, now they bustin' guns
But last week it was: ""My nigga Game! What up, dun?""
See that's what the fuck I mean, you can't trust these rap niggas
And you wonder why I always say fuck these rap niggas
So I'mma break it down for MC's and friends
If you don't hear your name, let the beef begin
Ain't got shit against Hov, I like the nigga's style
Nas is my nigga, I been bangin' him for a while
I fuck with Fat Joe, he got the streets locked
And thats the same reason I fuck with Kiss and D-Block
Place Eminem in the number three spot
And Snoop is like my big brother, we both raised by the Doc
Young Jeezy you hot, we both new to this
While I'm in the ATL, shout out to Ludacris
Cause your uncle Scarface show me that crime pays
Just like Paul Wall got me sittin' sideways
And I can't forget about the homie Mike Jones
Who? Mike Jones, Skeet screw the fuckin' song
I fuck with Slim Thug and my nigga Bun B
Can't do that without saying free Pimp C
And thats the reason why 50 try to pimp me
So I went window shoppin' and bought two Bentleys
I'm in the drivers seat, motherfucker don't tempt me
Turnin' Spider Loc against me, cause your scared to come get me
Cuz know whats up, Bloods still got love for 'em
Come to the block, I'll shake off the rug for 'em
As for G-unit, motherfucker it's a wrap
Ma$e made it out alive, thank God for that
If Dipset don't get you, Jesse Jackson will
And if all else fails, I'll see you in hell
Wear that G-unit spinner when you come to L.A
I have a nigga parkin' cars, dressed up like valet
He gonna turn back pastor when the gun in his face
The real chain still in Chicago but I'm takin the fake
You can call who you want, I ain't givin back shit
Unless Olivia show the whole world she got a dick
Can't sing to save her life, but she talk a lot of shit
And I want my ten G's cause Yayo caught a brick
I guess my G-Unot tattoo was a smart move
Cause in the end 
you lost a hundred mill to a cartoon
Three years after you got tatted by Cartoon
The beef is over, G-Unit gonna fall apart, soon
Hahahahaha
Faggot ass niggas
I guess I win nigga
Life is a game of chess nigga
Some king, some queens
Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo, Young Buck, Pastor fuckin' Ma$e
You niggas is pawns
50, or Boo Boo, or Curtis, or Chicken Little, hahaha
Stop Snitchin–Stop Lyin in stores December 6th
The DVD, it's a tell all motherfuckers
Yeah, my documentaries be better than your movies nigga, hahaha
I drove by your house nigga
Go buy the DVD, $16.99 nigga
At your local record store, Blockbuster, Sam Goody, Warehouse
Shout out to the moms and pops, for helping me slay them faggots
G-gu-g-g-gu, G-gu-g-g-gu, G-gu-g-g-gu, G-Unot! Hahahaha
Pop off nigga, hahahaha, pop off nigga, pop off

Teflon Don, SK's

Nigga talking like a G, but walking like a broad
I pull up at the light, pineapple in your car
Nigga I shatter lives, 
my music camouflage
My court killers at the center of my synagogue
Torture and extortion 'til I'm Fortune 500
From the porches to the Porsches with the wides on it
'fore you snitches bitch, you better put your lives on it
Get your twisted body found with them wires on it
I get my money, smoke extensive like it's Friday
I'm sitting sideways like I'm in my driveway
My shit pancakes, my shit 3 wheels
You niggas six feet, we getting 3 meals

They got jumped
45s, machine guns, and heavy artillery
They got jumped
45s, machine guns, and heavy artillery

Yeah I got 2 gun charges, 2 felonies, just got off probation

Today motherfucker, won't budge for no judge
Real nigga, I hold no grudge with no thugs
Come through spraying, bullets out the McLaren
They ain't meant for you, move bitch, you hard of hearing?
I speed off doing 90 with Tha Carter blaring
Bust shots in the Cavalier like I ball with Baron
Yeah I Blake Griff niggas, make stiff niggas
Eminem wasn't Dr. Dre's only sick nigga
Insane in the membrane like Soul Assassins
12 gauge stop a nigga heart like a bowl of Aspirin
I hold automatics, let your man hold the casket
Murder game cold as Aspen
, body found in the trash bin
First 48, they don't find me, case closed
Like a rehabilitation spot in Bobby Brown nose
Take 'em back to Boyz in da Hood when I pull the pump out
Something like C-Murder on Worldstar when I dump out, what!

They got jumped
45s, machine guns, and heavy artillery
They got jumped
45s, machine guns, and heavy artillery

Uh, ain't nothing changed but them bullets in my clip
I still'll pull it, still'll bully niggas on the strip (still)
Beef, I cook it fully with the fifth
And I ain't got no pets, I put a bullet in your bitch (ill)
Nigga with a gun in his hand, and won't bust it
Is like a, bitch with a dick in her hand, and won't suck it
This is the art of war, you niggas just drawing
Anything I target on is dearly departed, gone (gone)
Drive by or walk up on -- (walk up on)
I just stop, breathe, aim, cock, squeeze (squeeze)
Silencer on the Glock, infrared beam
Put your block up on machines while the pussies run and scream

45s, machine guns, and heavy artillery
They got jumped

Yeah nigga, the real one in the building
Broad Street Bully, certified G for real
Lil' rap niggas fucks me up

Game recognize game for real, what up Blood?
These niggas fucks me up niggas
My gangsta ain't never on trial
Niggas talk that shit, nigga what's your PP number nigga?

Mr. West / Money The Power,Hoodmorning (No Typo): Candy Coronas,2011.0,"Today Jimmy Hendrix is my motivation
I guess it's time for me to put them 808's in
Middle finger to them faggot niggas hating
And sake pase to all my fucking Haitians
Give me a pimp cup to pour my Rose in
I'm in the same car that Ricky Rozay in
Tell Satan that it's a celebration
So get your hands up, nigga get your hands up
Now, which one of us is really Mr. West?
Probably the one of us that really needs to wear his vest
And I'm just shooting my niggas some subliminals
Cause he got all the bitches and I be with the criminals
Beat sound like some crazy shit that Tim would do
Now when you see me, I'm the brown Eminem to you
Show you what I'm finna do, but you don't know it's me though
Magic when I shoot, get to bustin' like Hedo
Turkoglu, niggas,
 get to murking you niggas
Hit your block in the Caprice and just circle you niggas
Know what I mean? Think you fiends, how I'm serving you niggas
Know what I mean? Think I'm beans how I'm serving you niggas
And it ain't rice and beans when I'm serving you niggas
Punk you in front of your crew, Steve Urkel you niggas
Putting bull shit out, I hope it works for you niggas
And when it don't, come and see me, I got that work for you niggas

Like uh (Mr. West, Mr. West!)
Uh (Mr. West, Mr. West!)
Uh (Mr. West, Mr. West!)
Now, which one of us is really Mr. West?

He had a rose, I had a rose too
Eat your money up, you know how them hoes do
Burn rubber, swear to God they gon' love ya
Like rookie cops, can't wait to be undercovers
I'm six-five, nigga basketball size
You act like I can't fuck one of them basketball wives
I be a basketball Game, 
with my basketball dame
Feeling like, Hov,
 
call back, I'm watching basketball dang
D-mn, but I ain't talking 'bout dames
I ain't talking bout Hov, I'm just talking bout Game
Ask Ray Allen, they boy got game
Or Jesus Shuttlesworth the boy got range-
s
In the parking lot, 
niggas talk a lot
They way they gossiping hip-hop should be a barber shop
Getting cash money baby, why you trying to baller block?
Mad chick, her's, man somebody gotta call the shots


I guess it's me y'all, the highest on the see saw
Get so much money, why the fuck would I wann be y'all?
Shit, I be everywhere, but I don't ever see y'all
So for the next 12 songs, I'mma fucking R.I.P. y'all

Sometimes I hear anger talking, asking how I'm feeling
I'm just happy to be alive, Lord willing
Four albums later, two more children
Feeling like 'Ye, ""Mr. West is in the building""
What happened to the competition? Nigga I killed 'em
Can't drink Cristal, the nigga ho chilled 'em
I'm on this patent rhyme like I know them niggas
Them haters say I fell off? I'm 'bout to show them niggas
Drake and J. Cole them niggas
I sold nine mill, made nine mill, and kept it hood nigga
Just like Dre told a nigga
I made it rain in hundreds like I was Big Meech
I made it rain in hundreds when I was with Meech
Went from a Cutlass with the old front end
To a, um, Benz, stop light jumping
Now I'mma take you back to where I got jumped in
West side Compton, just east of the one ten

I just roll weed on your last album
And after that I'm 'bout to fuck your girl for 'bout an hour
Look around the club, uh, all I see is cowards
Mad 'cuz I got respect, the money, and the power
I just roll weed on your last album
And after that I'm 'bout to fuck your girl for 'bout an hour
Look around the club and all I see is cowards
Mad 'cuz I got respect, the money, and all the power

""No one man should have.."" 'Ye said that
""Can't knock the..."" Naw, Jay said that
""You can thank me..."" Naw, Drake said that
""Mind playing tricks on me"" Scarface said that
But I'm about to roll this paper plane
Hit the barber shop, get cut before this Laker game
Niggas hate The Game, sometimes I hate the fame
They hate my bitch, they hate my chain
I'm so hood, I might fly to New York and just take the train
On some John Travolta shit, just take the train
If you in New York at two o'clock, don't take the train
I make niggas dissapear, no David Blaine
I split your whole team up, no Jay and Dame
Fresher than Will Smith was before Jada came
Four albums, twelve cars, but the flow stay the same
Every nigga I dap turn blood, it's like I'm made of flame
Dipping this red flag, like the one I gave to Wayne


Go Dwight Howard, now watch them hoes run
Soon as the Game over, they back stripping for ones
Had your bitch all in my crib, stripping for fun
Getting head, thinking 'bout cars when I strip 'em for fun
Walk in my closet, throw on my J's, pick up my gun
Spin the block with some some shit that spit quicker than puns
I respect two East Coast niggas, Biggie was one
If he was living, he'd say that no one is sicker then son, uh
Young gun, bar none, the tightest where I'm from
Roll some much kush, got the leaves sticking to my thumb
As I break it down , bring that six tray around
Banging Nas album, yeah, you can hate me now
Treat beef like haircuts, I gotta fade it down
Ran out bars, guess I name-drop Slim and Baby now

You know I'll be digging, I'll be eating out that kitten
I'll be piggin' out
Never take her out to crustaceans, it be In-N-Out
Just like that Chocolate shake, nigga goin' in her mouth
She do everything except smoke, that mean let a nigga poke
That mean she be off the coke like Paris and her folks
Swear to God she a poke man

God screaming up out them speakers
So loud that a nigga can't hear you
Wake up to a diamond cross, I'm a Christian
Got a nigga feeling like Obama 'nem
Niggas shot out my windows, they jealous and envy
They spit on my 'Rari, they keyed up my Bentley
They went at my top dog like Ab-Soul and Kendrick
I said I'm a killa', god damn it I meant it
I said I sold crack, nigga bubbling skillets
At my grandma's house, I was selling work in it
And god bless her soul, she died
Back out the four, load up the five
Pop up the trunk, load up them pies
Aye 'Ye, ain't this how them niggas do it in the Chi?
Vice Lords, GD's
Crips, Bloods and Impala's on gold D's

Now he begging for his life on both knees

Got a problem blood, then come show me
I'm on Rosecrans ing them Kobe's
Got diamonds off in my Rollie
Granddaddy stuffed in my stogie
Motherfuck them Axel Foleys

I'm like Papa Smurf in that blue truck
Red hat, red pants
Walking inside dreams with the kush in my hand - I'm

Rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' them drugs up

Young nigga 15, broke, livin’ the scene
Sawed off in my pants, ‘bout to go make the lean
Finna' rob me a nigga who’s money wasn’t the same
Somebody gon' give it to me, or get one up in the brain
Mama used to stroke it just to feed me scraps
Every Saturday, it was YO! MTV raps
Got sick of looking at other niggas that ain't deserve it
So I followed my older brother to beat these traps
I ain't worried about the love, I've seen everything
The hood hot, like the devil had it off in his hands
Send a strap your way, I seen a couple of fans
Last pack, I took that and a couple of bands
If I ain't hustle to eat, I was doing that sippin' Screw
But they would give it to me, everyday I was paying dues
I was a young wild nigga missing a couple screws
In the hood, when I'm scared, only thing I'mma use, when I'm...


Mane, hold up
Young and I leans with a cup full of lean, and a 4-0 tucked
No more sleep, gotta get more bucks, OG rolled up
Stakes are high, so I pray to God the folks don't roll up
Big sister told me I need to grow up
But I need that money, better not crumb me
Pockets fat as my codeine tummy
Trying to get blow like my nose was runny
I work for mine, you can't take that from me
Wrap it up, like Egyptian mummy
And have it ready when I roll on up
Stacking dough on up, from the floor on up
And I'm all through the hood like ice cream trucks, just rollin'


Keep kush rolled, that dream I'm holding
In the candy Caddy' with with ninety molding
Bought a drop, put it in the shop
But everything I got, on that bitch stolen
Had a grill but couldn't afford the wheels
Had paint, but it wasn't candy
Kick endo to try and get that dough
Whole family know, so they couldn't stand me
Run and tell your mama, come get your son
Mama like damn, what the hell he done
Brother had bricks, but didn't give me shit
So when he went to the pen, I ain't send him shit
Mama at work, so I ran the house
Ray on lock, 
so now I'm the boss
Turn that face up like the Mary Jane
I was slanging 'caine, got us all kicked out


From Compton, all the way to Chi-Town
Back on down to Houston, Texas baby
Trae The Truth, Z-Ro, Slim Thugga
Paul Wall, Common, Kanye West, and The Game

Shed tears or is that to hard for you
I’m just a man, reflection of my family
Meaning you ain’t gotta have one to understand me
I got kids, I got friends
Only difference between me and you is I don’t care bout this benz
I care about Will he was dying and he needed me
I care about the Grammy they gave Missy they cheated me
But they cheated Drake, they cheated Justin Bieber
Guess America don’t like Canada we some fuckin heathens
Game can’t watch his mouth thats why his daddy beat him
Same mouth made him millions and now his daddy need him
Finally got a black president look at how they treat him
Kids starvin in Africa why only Oprah feed them?
What happened to the music that I know
I miss it, you too, I guess we feel like Bono

Is it my fault, cause I tried?
Gave it my all. Hip Hop died
Where do we go now, when it's over?
I'm lookin' all around
Can this be, the aftermath?

The living, the dead
These Dre beats, my head
My life, featuring Wayne
That was Jayceon, this is Game
Adjacent to the fame ain't chasing a damn thing
So tonight let all of your pain be champagne
I can't tame my killers but I can tell them chill
I might give you a pass depending how I feel
The bi polar bear
They said the end of the world is coming, I know it’s here
Cuz California cold this year
Detox, R.E.D
MC’s dead
Kill them softly like Lauren Hill
Skin heads goin K-K-Krazy cuz a nigga in a foreign wheel
We all born to die, some of us born to kill
If that don’t wake you up I hope tomorrow morning will


Never I thought I’d see the day when I, would roll up in the parking lot
And have people coming up to me for a photograph of the shit I talk about
Yela can I get an autograph Alabama so proud that we just can’t wait
Congrats on the Shady deal, any news on the release date?
I told them what I can, shake another hand sign another autograph it’s cool
Got fans gettin inked up, dedicated to me I love you too
Got 3000 sold, the spirit of rock and roll
Long barrel .38 loaded I’m John Wayne in Geronimo
So I dont really know whats got some these pussies panties in a ball
Cuz I never done shit but get better and believing in God
And leaving my mom at 15 with a dream and a cross
A cross that I didn’t see until I was nailed to it for believing at all
That I could ever be accepted the way that I saw it
I mean I knew it would be hard, but really come on y'all
Oh I’m a redneck? FUCK YOU tatted on my neck
I’ll sip high life in a can at the Grammys now add that to my rep

In my Gucci flip-flops, tan khakis, niggas sagging
Niggas pulled up on me, matte black G wagon
I'm like shit, the fo' fif's still in the house
And usually niggas shoot from where you from, come out they mouth
Got a nigga heart beating like a cutlass truck
But my mama raised a G and she don't fuck with punks
Niggas rolled down the window, couldn't tell who it was
Waving off the chronic smoke, is they Blood or Cuz?
Haha, it's my little cousin Jordan and he's solid
We went up last night, nigga said he forgot his wallet
We was bumping E-40, yeah, that Hurricane
Went through ten or twelve bottles of that Sluricane
We had six white bitches and a gang of weed

Pull up on Cedar, then I put it in park

And if you looking for the hoes fuck with me I'ma tell you when they come outside
When they come outside
And all the homies on the block all day so yeah a nigga gotta come outside
Gotta come outside

Ooh ooh ooh, nigga hopped out that rag and smelled the oohwee
My little nigga Marcus just pulled up from the I-E
Cup full of Henny, niggas gone off that YG
Told 'em take a fade little nigga saying Why Me?
If he jump up I'm with it, anybody can get it
Mayweather with the right, bop-bop, head splitted
'Cause nigga I'm from the Murda and I don't even bang
You got your ass knocked out, which one of you niggas is Game?
'Cause you fuckin' my cousin, she don't like it, I don't either
Take all that bass out your voice, homeboy this is Cedar
My bad Chuck, let a nigga hit the weed
Nah, take this quarter piece and drop it off in the trees
Watch the Fruits though, tell that nigga Soo Woo though
You can take the rag, don't get a scratch on my coupe though
And watch the Palmers they ain't tryin' to hear no truce though
Non-affiliated, still a shooter like Kukoc

Okay now why I'm always running from the police when I come outside
When I come outside
I be lowkey I be hoping they won't notice when I come outside
When I come outside
And if you looking for the hoes fuck with me I'ma tell you when they come outside
When they come outside
And all the homies on the block all day so yeah a nigga gotta come outside
Gotta come outside

Yo this your man, DJ EZ-Dicc, I'm about to be out of here
Up next you got my man Z-Boy Fro and he's gonna hit ya'll off with this Battlecat joint

You got the juice now, baby, you got the- you got the juice
You got the juice now, baby

It been ten years since you heard from niggas from the West side
Now we on the cover of the Vibe
A nigga shot me five times, I'm happy to be alive
And my mama told me, ""You got the juice now, baby""
My first album went five times plat'
Lookin' for California, it was on my back
I was 23 when I had my first kid
And his mama told him when he came out
""You got the juice"" Like father, like son, uh
Top down, Mercedes throttle
Wrist lookin' like a nigga just played the lotto
I am to Compton what Ye is to Pablo
Run up on the car, just spray with hollows
I grew up in the six-trey Impala
Ain't make the league but I made the dollars
Recordin' my demo, knew Dre will follow
Remember, Eve told me

""You got the juice now, baby, you got the juice
You got the juice now, baby, you got the- you got the juice
You got the juice now, baby""

Left the Unit and the world went cray
I blame it on the California mindstate
Too much weed, weather, women, chronic seeds, ass, titties
Can a nigga pour his Henny?
Without niggas actin' fake in his motherfuckin' face one time
'Fore I pull the .40 up out the waist line
I'm the first Compton nigga Dr. Dre signed
And Mary J. told me at Baseline: ""You got the juice now, baby""
Then my second album went plat' too
And it was thug life with this Eazy tattoo
But I never forgot where I came from
Or where I got my name from, my grandma told me
""You got the juice now, baby,"" and here's something I can't forget
My mama brought a nigga up on that L.A. gangster shit
Your boy ain't never gonna change, mama
Here's some change, mama, and a Range, mama
She looked back and said

""You got the juice now, baby, you got the juice
You got the juice now, baby, you got the juice
You got the juice now, baby, you got the- you got the juice
You got the juice now, baby""

So much pressure applied, all this pressure applied
Pray this pressure applied to our lives
Feels like we gon' bust, feels like we gon' bust
Over gestures you die, ain't no question that I'm
Tryna make it out alive but sometimes
Feels like I'm gon' bust, feels like I'm gon' bust
Feels like I'm gon' bust, yeah

So get her a trash bag so she can pick up a one
She bend down, I see her tracks
I make it rain, she throw it back
And all this money keep me in pussy, no cat
Stacks
, but I got racks on racks on racks
Pool side at the W, take a puff and relax
This that millionaire lifestyle, 
audemar iced out
Order more spades then, hit her with that lifestyle
But these fake hoes won't leave me alone
Fake bag, fake ass, and she beggin' for patron
My credit Meagan Good, my money Nia Long
And them heels you got on, pound sign

Basic bitch
I gotta bitch with me, she gotta bitch with her
And I ain't talkin' bout no basic bitch
Beyoncé, laced front on
Who you trying to front on, and stunt on?
Basic bitch, she gotta fake Louie
Fake loobies, fake booty
So she a basic bitch
At the club all weekend, she trying to get rich
But all I got is this dick for a basic bitch

So knock it off with your knock-off
You give head to any nigga riding with his top off
You the type I'd knock off, forget I ever met you
Block you on Twitter, never BBM or text you
Lookin' for the next you, I just wanted to sex you
Hit you on the D-Low, 
I'm Cee Lo, F You
Cause everytime I'm up in the club looking for hoes
Everything look good off a couple bottles of rose
Downloading your swag, Starting off with your toes
And paintin' a mental picture of you without all your clothes
Have you ever fucked a millionaire in the back of a Rolls rose?
With Amber Rose? I ain't talking 'bout no


I can tell by your avatar, you never had caviar
Your friends can't go, you can't go, you don't have a car
But that weave hanging down to your ass
Bitch ain't from Dallas, but she routing for the Mav's
You a bandwagon ho fo sho'
You up in every video takin' off your clothes
I thought I told you that you wouldn't get far
Melyssa Ford tears, seen her, her child's mad, that Honda Accord is

Sitting alone each night
Are you expecting to find the love (Love-love-love-love)

Used to sell it all night
Virgil owe me a percentage of that Off-White
Take a nigga bitch out of spite
I’m every bitch type
I'm on the block, Rolls truck sittin' nice
Niggas still can’t see me, I'm hidin' in plain sight
Last 15 years of my life, I cut any hip-hop nigga fuckin' throat with this mic
I hit the dealership and get them niggas right
Before you cop it, you gotta ask, ""What's the price?""
You in the club makin' toast to your life
I'm in this Ghost gettin' throat at this light
We ain’t the same, nigga, your ticket’s by the lights
I'm wipin’ sweat off my Fendi at this Pacquiao fight
Niggas that I thought was, wasn't that nice

My diamonds offset
Yeah, my Audemar wet
It look like me, Nicki, and Cardi B havin' phone sex
Who gon' flex? Who want next?
How many niggas I done bodied and me and Hov ain't done a song yet
And all you niggas cappin', actin' like you own jets
Land it at Teterboro and bring that ass to Funk Flex
Bring them Dracos, you been shootin' at niggas on texts
All these threats, ain't even comfortable inside your own flesh
Jimmy Iovine should have kept his advice
Instead of tellin' niggas they could ever step in this light

Tell Future, ""Step in this light"" (Light, light)
Tell Chance, ""Step in this light"" (Light, light)
Tell Sean, ""Step to this light"" (Light, light)

Tech 9, 45, just in case ya like numbers

Two step all in ya face, we might Unk ya haha
Bandanna on the right side, east side until I die

We wear them chains like its Mardi Gras
And we pull guns like Quick Draw McGraw
See I’m from New Orleans, Louisiana
And he’s from Compton, raise ya bandanna
We carry them caskets, we tote them hammers
Soo to the woo, yeah that’s our grammar
Lemme hear ya say: “soo woo, soo woo, soo woo”

And that’s perfect cause perfect is to me
What’s perfect as Halle, or a jab from Ali
So capitalize the P cause perfect is Godly
Black Wall Street the perfect family, The Cosby

I passed the baton on Solange, I’m sure like Al B
But a Boujy B would never give me the perfect P-I-R-U

I’ll show you how bangers bang
Four five cocked back, move the crowd like Dana Dane
Switch plates, paint the Range
Leave so much blood on the wall look like the fucking painters came
Dead wrong ain’t it man, I told niggas I ain’t a game
All black gold chain, looking like the Saints is playin’
He sold a milli, I’m vanilli
So it ain’t a thing to make it rain in hundred dollar bills
We throwing paper planes, riding through the N.O
Red Marc Jacob frames, we disappear like David Blaine
And pop up at the Lakers game
They playing the C’s with Paul Pierce throwing the B’s
That make the ref affiliated, every time he hit a three
Ken Griffey lost all his fans taking off his red top
Bloods in New York like Manhattan took a head shot
I’m one blood, he the Carter with the dread locks

If I ever catch her slidin' or ridin' through the (Streets of Compton)

So stop that bickering,""
 I got a bitch from the Nickersons
That got a fucking bounty on my head, uh oh

Something more comfortable for you to just bang your shit to
So lady, go on and work those hips
Like them inmates work those divs

Pull up to her crib and hit that pussy like a crack pipe
I listen to Dipset, want Cam and Jim to squash it
But how can I say that when I ain't made up with Fif yet?
I be watching 
Power
 while I benchpress
Four plates on each side, maxed out, 6 reps
On my Drizzy Drake, yeah 6 rep
Rollie with the grizzly face, Mike Conley, is he straight?
Damn right he is
I go platinum and I violate niggas like Chris Lighty did
I make music for all my niggas locked up state
With Blac Chyna on they walls—and I done seen her fuck-face
Quarter million on the dresser—nigga, what safe?
Trigger my alarm and you gon' run into some duct tape

I'm still here—they said I wasn't welcome
Came in the game and then everybody felt him
What your life like? Mine's 'bout gettin' money and bitches
64s and switches, poppin' guns with my niggas
What your life like? Mine's 'bout listenin' to 
Illmatic
In my grandmother's attic tryna spit above average
What your life like? Mine's 'bout sheddin' tears when Pac died
Swimming in money like the Rothschilds
Nigga, what your life like?
Nigga, what your life like?
Tell me; what your life like?

I done have conversations with Timbo
Passed on a couple Pharrell and Swizz instrumentals
I done wore a two piece tux on Jimmy Kimmel
Then came to the hood and whopped your ass like I was Kimbo
I done lost 20 millions on lawyer fees
But I'mma get it back when I sue Jimmy for my royalties
I done had Scott Storch recordin' me
Drove through Compton with the doors up—ain't no ignornin' me
I done took shots at Jay
, 
I done took shots of 'Gnac
I done took shots for Cedar—five couldn't drop me flat
R.I.P. to Frog, R.I.P. to Will
He was just as ill as Will, so I know how Nas feel
Nigga, I'm the greatest
""300 Bars"" was like 15 minutes long—tell me, how many times you played it?
How many times you had your 
Documentary
 stolen and replaced it?
That's that five-million-out-the-gate shit

I'm still here—they said I wasn't welcome
Came in the game and then everybody felt him
What your life like? Mine's 'bout gettin' money and bitches
64s and switches, poppin' guns with my niggas
What your life like? Mine's 'bout listenin' to 
Illmatic
In my grandmother's attic tryna spit above average
What your life like? Mine's 'bout sheddin' tears when Pac died

Bompton,1992,2016.0,"JP Did This

Six in the mornin', police at my door
Woulda seen them niggas comin' but the cameras is broke
My nigga Ant in the kitchen, cookin' up for a week
And my lil homie Pooh on my mama couch sleep
We cookin' base, we cookin' base
We cookin' base, we cookin' base
50 grams on the table, a key in the couch tucked
And it's time to break it down 'cause everythin' gettin' flushed
Lookin' out the window tryna find a way out
Seen the SWAT team creepin' on the side of the house
They threw a canister through the window, it shattered the glass
So I went into the closet and pulled out my gas mask

It's gettin' funky, it's gettin' funky
It's gettin' funky, it's gettin' funky
It's gettin' funky, it's gettin' funky
(And I die before I go back to jail, tell them niggas this is)
Bompton, Bompton
Bompton, Bompton
Bompton, Bompton
Bompton, Bompton
It's gettin' funky, it's gettin' funky
It's gettin' funky, it's gettin' funky
It's gettin' funky, it's gettin' funky

Nigga fuck the cops
They're supposed to have my house surrounded but it's not
So I'm hoppin' over the back gate with my Glock
Crossin' Wilmington with 1500 in my sock
Look across the street, they runnin' in and out my spot
Ant on the curb in cuffs
And Pooh don't know what's goin' on 'cause he just woke up
'Til my Cincinnati fitted walked in and out the store
Ain't find no drugs or guns so they let my niggas go
We supreme, we mix that Sprite with that promethazine
Hop in that Cutlass, hit the switch and flee the scene
Euro comin' up the block lookin' like a monster
Chucking up P's when we ridin' through

Bompton, Bompton
Bompton, Bompton
Bompton, Bompton
Bompton, Bompton

Ridin' down Alameda, everythin' was straight
Until we stopped at a light, and ran into the Grapes
My heart beatin' like a 15 inch with bass
'Cause I reached for my strap and it wasn't on my waist
I'm a fool, what kind of nigga go to work without his tools?
And you often watch wearin' red like it's bool
It's usually on sight with the Crips
My guns stuck between the seats and them niggas ain't trip
Bust a left on Imperial, slidin' on gold rims
Empty the guts out the swisher then hop on the 110
Look around, I don't see one black and white
So we rolled the windows up and hotboxed at the light, yeah

It's gettin' funky, it's gettin' funky
It's gettin' funky, it's gettin' funky
It's gettin' funky, it's gettin' funky
(Watched Kobe score 60 on the Jazz now we heading back to)

All up in the club, niggas tryna fuck
Holdin' bottles up, get you caught up in that whirlwind
I text her like ""King what you doing?""

I Grew Up on Wu-Tang,1992,2016.0,"I grew up on the crime side, the New York Times side
Staying alive was no jive
Had secondhands, Mom's bounced on old man
So then we moved to Shaolin land
A young youth, yo, rocking the gold tooth, 'Lo goose
Only way I be gettin' the G off was drug loot
And let's start it like this son
Rolling with this one and that one
(Bongo by the way)

(Red Wallabies) Buzzin' with my Killa Beez
Chronic had my eyes chinky like Compton was the Philippines
Junior prom, red suit, Tasha in that limousine
Tryna suck the head off my dick like a guillotine
Came in her mouth, then gave her some Listerine
Put a condom on and let her grind it like a centipede
(Cash rules everything around me)
Before Dre found me, before my city crowned me
Bummy lil nigga, pussy niggas used to clown me
Had to wear my brother's clothes, them shits used to drown me
6 years passed, now I'm banging in the county
Niggas that used to talk shit, won't even come around me
Reciting Method Man while my celly just sit there
Niggas know I been on the Wu before Ric Flair
Came home through the hood, GX shinin'
Now these bitches think I'm Lex Diamonds

Nigga I grew up on Wu-Tang

I grew up on Wu-Tang, dope had my shoe game Liu Kang
Jordan 12's sick as hell, Michael Jordan flu game
Glass jar, Pyrex, obsessed with the blue flame
Lexus coupe, rubbin' on them titties boy, 2 Chainz
Top of the food chain, niggas wanna kill me
'Cause I turned into the plug, I'm where the chronic and the pills be
RZA with the rings, Ol' Dirty with the stainless
Five .38 revolvers, thirty-six chambers
Killah like Ghostface, as the Rollie rotate
Daytons on the S-Class equipped with the floor safe
And we had the stash spots with them red and blue tops
Chronic in the GLAAD lock, the dope spot padlocked
In the living room baggin' shit up, watchin' Matlock
Black Glock, crack rock bundled in my black socks
And my mama workin' late, skinny nigga servin' weight
Let the chronic circulate the Purple Tape

Roadside,Born 2 Rap,2019.0,"My lawyer's son died in his sleep last night
Got me thinkin’ 'bout who I was in my past life
To be surrounded by so much pain
I understand my karma, but why is their's the same?
Two good people, two amazin’ sons
Just yesterday, they had both, now they raisin' one
I look at the clouds and just think
I could lose mine, or they could lose me in one blink
When I think one day it all ends, I start to drink
And fathom suicide, 'cause I was almost on the brink
And it feel like my family been jinxed
Ever since I found my grandmother stiff
Leanin' over the kitchen sink
I could cry enough tears to float Noah's Ark
Perfect health, but she died of a broken heart
And after that, it was a domino effect
First my uncle, then my daddy, I guess I'm in line next

I got lost on the roadside
Yeah, I lost my way
I give thanks to the Most High
'Cause he kept me safe
Hope to God that I don't die
So I pray
If I go, mama, don’t cry
I was on the roadside
I was on the roadside

How come you can’t learn a lesson until you go through it?
How come you can think about the past, but can't go to it?
If I could, I would float through it
Walk up to Triple X’s BMW window and stick a note to it
Tell him to drive off, the Devil comin'
Ever since he fell from Heaven, he been tryin' to settle somethin'
I keep the faith and try not to question God
But I got a problem when I see innocent people die
I sympathize with Jews, I sympathize with blacks
Sympathize with Natives, America’s yours if you want it back
Where the hunger at?
Probably under a tree in Mississippi by the river where they hung us at
If Jesus walked, why we all runnin' laps?
Feel like endin' racism further than where the sun is at
A wall to keep people from people, how dumb is that?
I guess we shouldn't put our thoughts on the front of hats

I got lost on the roadside
Yeah, I lost my way
I give thanks to the Most High
'Cause he kept me safe
Hope to God that I don't die
So I pray
If I go, mama, don't cry
I was on the roadside
I was on the roadside

For sure that my soul will fly
Cold, drippin' on the other side
I know it happened to me every time
Caught out on the roadside
Thumb high in the wind, itch
I tell my mama I'ma be alright now
I'll be home in a few weeks
Soon, 'til then I'll sing this song to you

I got lost on the roadside
Yeah, I lost my way
I give thanks to the Most High
'Cause he kept me safe
Hope to God that I don't die
So I pray
If I go, mama, don't cry
I was on the roadside
I got lost on the roadside
Yeah, I lost my way
I give thanks to the Most High
'Cause he kept me safe
Hope to God that I don't die
So I pray
If I go, mama, don't cry

Lookin at You,Doctor’s Advocate,2006.0,"Walking down the street, in my All Stars
In my khaki suit, doin' what I do
Walking down the street, smoking chronic
In my black locs lookin', at you

Guess who's back on the West coast tracks
It's the motherfucking Messiah of gangsta rap
Still dip in the six-fo', still puffin' on the same chronic
Haters mad 'cause I still got it
I'll never fall off, even without the Doc
You niggas sellin' your soul trying to stay on top
Bitch nigga check your Kotex
You niggas ain't moving shit like the hand on a fake-ass Rolex
I'm five million sold
The cover of my last album the only time you see me sittin' on gold
I'm the most anticipated, most celebrated
Most loved and the motherfuckin' most hated
Keep rolling like gold Daytons
Niggas got the game fucked up like Hennessy with a Coke chaser
You gotta deal with me, I'm the West Coast savior
Niggas think of me every time they six-fo' scrapin'

What do you call a nigga who's overbearing
Belligerent, foul, defiant and very disrespectful?
You call that nigga the Doctor's Advocate
He's a reflection of Dr. Dre in his heyday in the worst way
The five star surgeon general
Took Jayceon to the Aftermath research department
And gave him a blood test
It came back G-A-M-E positive
The nigga's infected with the Game virus
His oratorical skills are so impeccable
That niggas in the streets call him Cyrus
The young damu's down with violence
'Cause in his heart he's a tyrant
It's not a game, it's just called The Game
There'll be no referees, no halftime reports
When the game is over, The Game is over
You can't put a quarter in the machine and get three mo' men
That's the end

Walking down the street, in my All Stars
In my khaki suit, doin' what I do
Walking down the street, smokin' chronic
In my black locs lookin', at you

I done been to hell and back
Left for dead, you know who to thank for that
Finished my second LP without a Dr. Dre track
You can take my soul but can't take my plaques
I'm the motherfuckin' snare when it touch the beat
I'm the 808 drum that got you movin' your feet
I'm the heir to the throne after the D-R-E
Product of my environment, you old-ass niggas
Get ready for your early retirement
Before I let hip-hop burn down I run in the building like a fireman
Who can outspit me when I'm high off sticky
Throwin' back Patron shots in some creased up dickies
I'm D.O.C. certified, Ice Cube lynch'd me
Snoop stamped me and the good Doc handpicked me
You still with me?
Me and my mic can't be separated like Interscope and-hahaha

Oh shit

These crips, these bloods, these esés, they playin' cut throat
You a fish out of water, every MC gets slaughtered
If you ain't Nas, Eminem or fuckin' S dot Carter
I tie up your wife, pull out my dick jack it off, kiss the knife

She wear a scarf, Louis V to be exact
It's a wrap, messing up her wrap, blowing out her back
Never let another rap nigga hit it from back or the front
On my mama nigga, I be gone for months
I come back
(And it's still tight, I like when it's real tight)
I'mma lick in circles now..

Feels like when you try them red bottoms on
It feels like the song cause we all the way gone..
Between me and you, do anything for old girl
Like hit it in the morning, yeah, Cole World

Baby you're the one
You ain't gotta hit the club no more
Cause we done did that
Tryna find the one
But you been looking for love in all the wrong places
Every day's a movie, girl, you make the scene
They gon keep on watching, give em something to see
We gonna be all the way gone
We gonna be all the way gone

She call me all the time, I ain't no regular Joe
I be staying at the Roosevelt more than Marilyn's ghost
I met some bitches with Chuck, but I was wearing some Foams
Shorty been fly forever, these bitches' parachutes broke
TC's is on her person I'm aware that you know
And you know the flow, they jack it, I'm apparently cold, you know
Life's lemons is bitter, I need another fruit
She know we can't elope, look at what honey do
Straight G thing, double M G thing
Weed they can't fuck with, I'm puffin A.C. Green
When I peep in the public, bet I'm leaving with something
And I'm so fly I make some homebodies ?? leave the luggage
Shout out Donny Sublime
Shout out Bobby on Hundreds
Not too many is touching, double M G this summer
The RED album, lil red shortie, you can't touch her
I know Mario's on the hook, but I was playing Duck Hunt


Yeah, he blowing up your cell phone
Send him the voicemail cause we all the way gone
And you ain't doing nothing wrong
But killing the competition in that Cosabella thong
Turn to the side, let me see them thighs
Profile, damn I'm digging your style, we can start slow now
Then speed it up, this playing in the background
While I beat it up - I beat it up
(Baby soon as we get home, it won't take us too long)
(We gon make it to the bedroom, I like the guest room)
(You can pick the next room)
(Put the camera on the tripod, got me playing on your iPod)

Life Is But A Dream,OKE: Operation Kill Everything ,2013.0,"I am happy to join with you today
And what will go down in history
As the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation

So it seems I’m lost
In between exotic cars and fiends
Palms hella itchy, baby mama bitchy
Dish washer broke cuz them pots too sticky
Snap back to the back cause I got that crack
And I’m from that city
Where even the girls is packing they strap Beats on
They don't hear that rap, shit
Unless it’s Y.G or Problem
Then them bitches turn up ASAP like they went to school in Harlem
But they know they from Compton
Yea they know they from Compton
Where we put bass with the head before Dre was with Monster
We pulled guns on niggas 'fore we ever play Contra
Turned contra into bands and that make them hoes dance so
Let that bitch breathe before she take yo kids
And you be forced to watch that bitch leave
And that’s every nigga’s situation
In a town where them gang signs go up
And them bitches going down

Life is a but a dream
I’m searching for a dream
Life is a but a dream
Life is a but a dream
Life is a but a dream
Life is a but a dream
Life is a but a dream
Life is a but a dream
Life is everything but a dream

A great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. But one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free

Niggas robbed 2 Chainz on World Star, I seen these niggas runnin
Them ain’t yo niggas no more ‘cause I got mine's comin
You take a nigga jewels and act like you done did something
We take a nigga life and act like we ain’t did nothing
And all of this is at the push of a button
I got niggas bustin' simply because they ribs touchin'
No we ain’t tryna work at Mickey D's
Niggas is tryin to put that six on Ds
And flip one of them Bentley keys
Hood niggas that only wanna be hood rich
Stack a hundred thousand in the safe and wife a good bitch
Cop a Gucci belt, maybe Louis too
Line a Challenger with that Camaro and see what it do
Hit toxic ‘cause we got a fit and can't wasted it
It’s hot as fuck but at least we can see these hoes’ faces
Ask Drama what that shit do
Every time he hit the city give him a couple hoes and a pistol
‘Cause I, I hold my niggas down
I said I, I hold my niggas down
Yea I hold my niggas down
And the day I go out this is Kendrick’s crown

No, we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until “justice rolls down like waters, and righteousness like a mighty stream.”

Yeah, see, it's that real nigga shit they been waitin' on, nigga
You know? That West coast shit, that down South shit

I said one nigga down, two niggas run it
Game and the snowman, a hunnid miles and gunnin', ayy
Here come the paramedics!

It goes one for the money, two for the dough
On the count of three, niggas kickin' down your door, haha

It goes one foot down, two niggas run it
Game and the snowman, a hunnid miles and gunnin', ayy
Here come the paramedics! (Haha)

Here come the pain! I've got a name
Ever since an adolescent I've been deep in the game
All I need is morphine, a lil somethin' for the pain
Everything is all good like a hook from T-Pain
 (Haha)
They say you're nobody 'til somebody kills you
I say, ""Go be somebody, even if it kills you""
They say, ""Death smell like some bad ass weed""
'Nother watch, 'nother chain the last thing a nigga need
I swear to God, chopper right by the night stand
Clip a half a hunnid pillowcase another hundred grand
Now get some rest when your conscious keep wakin' ya
The evil kicks in and them demons start shakin' ya
Havin' nightmares, I wake up in a cold sweat
Get dressed and hit the club in a Corvette
God damn cuh, you souls say some cold shit
Probably why they still ridin' to your old shit
It's probably why them beats all still ridin' wit'cha
It's probably why the rip riders still sidin' wit'cha
It's probably why them real niggas still hustlin' to ya
I know you hear it everyday, it ain't nothin' to ya
They say pictures worth about a thousand words
These niggas talkin' like they really worth a thousand birds
Here come the paramedics, bitch, I done told you
When them niggas callin' beef, it's really tofu

It goes one for the money, two for the dough
On the count of three, niggas kickin' down your door, haha
Here come the paramedics!

It goes one foot down, two niggas run it
Game and the snowman, a hunnid miles and gunnin', ayy

See us ridin' like some mobsters with the trunk full of choppers
Give a nigga a couple shots and I ain't talking about vodka
Hangin' out the sunroof, Snowman drivin'
Nigga live through these shots: Put his ass on Survivor!
Fresh up out the trap, I ain't never been a rat
Get cheese like a mouse, so I'm honest throwin' stacks
Let you suckers make it rain, I'll make it Katrina
And pile all them hoes in the back of my Beamer
Hit the freeway, bumpin' Geto Boys with the V12 steamin'
Top down, in the rain, California dreamin'
I'd be lying if I said I still flip birds, well, nigga, I still flip birds!
Word to the doors on this Gina I'm sitting on
Ain't a rapper alive me and Jeezy ain't shittin' on
Who else you know shit out Benjamins, and piss Patrón?
Put Michael Buffer between us, and let's get it on!

The Game

Hey, Snowman, these niggas hustlin' backwards
Here come the paramedics! (Haha)
I'ma pull the K out and turn 'em around, look
Here come the paramedics!

If I give you half a chicken, can you break that bitch down?
Tell the truth, it's me nigga, ain't nobody else around
Jeezy said it's a recession, so we hustling that May weather
My birds the best pound for pound, like Mayweather
Undisputed: I never lost a brick
UPS, FedEx and duct taped to a bitch
Put her ass on the Greyhound
Tell that hoe to stay down
Sleep the first forty-eight and wake up in the A-Town
Give a fuck about a bitch
Die for the paper, hustle relentless
Nigga, I take the sky from a scraper
The Gerber out a baby mouth, the fire out of Satan's house
These rappers turned saints when we pull them fuckin' gauges out
Black Tims kickin' in the door at your lady house
He at the strip club, well, fuck it, we gon' wait it out
She tipped him off, so now all the K's is out
Relocated, shot him down from the neighbor's house

You better not step to me wrong

Will they mourn me when I'm gone?

39 and I'm still bangin'
I can't get out if I wanted to
All I did was document my life
I ain't put that red rag in front of you
My first album had the world lit
Hit the hood and brought that Hummer through
I finally got the Impala candy-painted
Show you outta-towners what that summer do
Started off with sixty niggas with me everywhere I went
Hundred-twenty cups inside a Summer Jam tent
I went from broke, fantasizin' 'bout Christina Aguilera
To puttin' TVs in the dash of my mama's Xterra
This is real shit
I'm spittin' bars from the gun niggas get killed with
I had to cover my son and let that steel spit
I talked about it in songs, niggas got real sick
Dre thought that I was just rappin'
I told 'em I had bodies, no cappin'
Nigga, this the new Compton
2005, my whole life got live
Picture a gang member on the cover of the Vibe
Tell 'em why it's West Side

'Cause L.A. niggas with the bullshit

This my life
It's more than music
A lot of niggas rap but I was born to do it
Took my mama two days to give birth
And how I repay her? Goin' through her motherfuckin' purse
It's crazy how she loved me after all my dirt
Nigga disrespect her, he gon' touch the earth
If it's me or my niggas, then I'ma die first
Go on my 'Gram, put that pic of me and DOM on some shirts
It's all fun and games 'til that Super Soaker squirt
You lost somebody you love, I know it hurt
I got two dead brothers, one dead father
A mama with a pacemaker, two sons, and a daughter
I got a lot to live for but I ain't scared to die
I got this Hennessy and my nigga DOM KENNEDY, West Side

No body, no casket, just blood spillin’
I ain't a dead President but I love millions
They like “Game, where ya been?”
Yeh Blood chillin’
But not on no islands or no villa’s
I’ve been lost in Compton with some drug dealers
I bought the Relapse loved it, hit the block hugged it
Em still spit crack the Aftermath oven is a muthaf-cker
But I ain't seen it in years
Still survive like niggas threw me off the first tier
Still the most gutta, spit the most butta
My album’s got more game than niggas at the Rucker
Who said I’ll never go Platinum, never drop a Phantom
I park my shit at every strip club in Atlanta
Peace to my nigga T.I. for keeping a level head
Niggas I know flip after doing bids in the feds
So peace to C-Murder, come to my hood see murder
Ain't a street in my city that you ain't heard of
Bought up on the block, no love, black Glocks, chrome slugs
And we all fit OJ’s glove
And I’ma keep name droppin’ long as my name poppin’
I mean long as the ‘cane poppin’
All white nikes, white Range, white pipes, crack in the concrete
Living the coca-leaf life
I switch cars like superhead switch stars
You know why, cause I’m a crook bitch
Fuck ya book bitch
I live life like ain't no money on my books bitch
I write the 16, you sing on the hook bitch
Dickin’ em out, foreign cars I’m whippin’ em out
Been gang bangin’ since the first Pippen’s was out

Me and my infra-red-red
Yeah thats right, my infra-red-red
All I need is my inferared-red
So fuck the gun as long as its infrared-red

Same colour as the big apple
Its for my New York niggas thats in the hood clappin’
I done been through Brooklyn, Queens, BX and Harlem
Only chase money, never chase the stardom
Back to the law, thats how I became a target
Respected in every hood, bullet proof regardless
My Glock got no feelings, hollows leave you heartless
Retaliation like tryna swim in the shark pit
Will I ever go at Nas, hell no
Will I ever go at Jay, I don’t know
Stay hittin em with pot shots
Ridin’ round tryna figure out who got Pac shot
Cause that got BIG shot
, nigga’s try to take out LA like big shot
Thats Chauncey Billups, for you niggas who don’t understand it
You rap niggas like bitches, pitching underhanded
It’s like throwin soft balls at Derek Jeter
I keep it hood, never put money in parking meters
Like the fuck the US government
I be on some other shit
28 inch rims rubber shit
Roll down the window fuck with this
Roll up the endo, fuck with this
Get it backward, yeah my shit that good
No more medical weed, back to chronic
No more Belvedere, Grey Goose and tonic
Keep a nigga f-cked up with a mind state like
Dont get ya nigga f-cked up, you know the crime rate up


And I can pop a nigga from a rooftop
Or hit ‘em up close, let ‘em know that I’m a fucking killer
Like Ghost-face, no trace for the jakes
When it come to the base in the kitchen I’m a chef like Rae
Nas was like U-God, I’m like “nah you God”
Right next to RZA as I’m lighting up the swisha
Pourin’ out this liquor for my niggas
That was bigger than the ditches that they living
That was put in by the triggers
They some niggas with some cold hearts
And you wonder why I walk around
Like my soul lost, black hoody on
Writing music like Mozart
Denzel, John Travolta, I play both parts
Drive this raggedy ass Bentely like its a go-kart
Ain't been crazy since I learned how to throw dart
Run up on his muthaf-cking car, you a dead man
Nah, don’t sweat it like LeBron James headband
Empty out the clip on anybody but Redman
I Blackout and you can Blackout 2
But I got night vision on this muthaf-ckin infra-red-red

Right stroke, left stroke, dick swole in it

Walk in the liquor store like where the patrón, I need a whole case

And you know what I mean if you ever sold yay
We can take it from the top like San Jose
Or the bottom of the yacht in St. Tropez
So, pop the rosé, ok, ok
She got a white bronco, call her OJ
She like slow man, she my snow flake
Don't smoke chronic, but she can sniff the whole eighth
Her Columbian. Like Scarface
And we ain't gotta fuck. She all face
She from the valley, somewhere in Cali
My homie Snoop used to fuck with her sister Sally
I pulled over in the alley
She shift my gears and whispered in my ear

I wanna do it to you. (We ain't gotta fuck)
I'm talkin' white soft porn
So let me blow your mind. (We ain't gotta fuck)
I'm talkin' white soft porn

Yea, Ay, Uh
Don't be intimidated
When I put it on you, baby, you be liberated
Ay, We gettin' innovative
This new position that I'm thinkin', let me demonstrate it
Ay, Ain't gotta fornicate
And your performance is important when you use your face
Ay, She never used to be this way
She was a les 'til I went ahead and screwed her straight
Ay, undo your bra with one hand
If anything is gonna care it on and cum can
Cum again, invite 'em if you have any fun friends
I love it when it's girl upon girl with one man
Ay, put your butt on my mustache, fuck that
Won't eat unless your shavin' the muff back, puff pass
Rub 'em from the front to the butt crack
She love it when I play with my tongue, I'm just sayin'


Now, now, let's get acquainted
Shots of Cîroc how you let up like Vegas
SL painted
Top back drop take a photo half-naked
Don't be lazy
We on that, everyday a wet dream, baby
Sex on the beach by the leather on the seats
Lookin' for some head, I don't really gotta think
She said you know where I be, Roosevelt suite
Haha. Sunset women like the best
Walkin' at the light like I can change your life
Yea, yea, I rarely see the same girl twice
Let me get her number then I'm fuckin' tonight
Tell her call her friend then we fuckin' tonight

He from Cali, he can't rap
He ain't better than this nigga
That's my favorite artist
Fuck y'all, hear the breakdown

No detox, I'm comfortable dog
Like the solo Reeboks right up under me dog
And it feel like I done it before
Sit in the throne pollutin the airwaves like a Hummer exhaust
Don't let Makaveli fool you homie, thugging it costs
Pour out a little liquor for the loved ones that we lost
You ain't gotta wait for the album I don't fuck with The Source
But I turn up my Eazy-E and let it bump in the Porsche
I mean turn up my B.I.G. and let it bump in the Porsche
Tell 'em to roll red carpet when he come in New York
Hip-hop police on me think they runnin New York
Till I lace my Air1 show 'em how to run in New York
They tryin to take me downtown put me under the court
Cause Joe Buddens told 'em I carry a gun in New York
And homey that's strictly fact, he got ripped on wax
So he snitched just to get me back
No matter what you say dog, your shit be whack
You better watch what you say, it might get you clapped
Here's a little advice, homie: switch your raps
Cause that shit on your last album ain't get you plat
What nigga you need a gun? I'll get you that
P-89 nigga let Dre stitch you back
It ain't an industry, niggas I admit to that
But I don't even want your chain, I'll let the Crips do that
12 bars for that bitch, he won't live through that
Even a nigga with a ten year bid knew that
Put a gun in his mouth yeah, yeah do that
He a pussy (sniff, sniff) his own kid knew that
I'm Ready To Die, B.I.G. knew that
He ain't eatin, look at his white tee you could see his ribs through that
You cocksucker, let your ears do that
Or ride later do me ooh wee now back to rap
2 Lincoln Continentals sittin back to back
Leavin' Jersey City naw nigga, Hackensack
Where's that? Somewhere where the crackers at
Real far from where the roaches and rats is at
Come to Compton I'll show you where the racquet's at
Down the street from the Staples Center where they Hack-a-Shaq
Give the advance money back, I ain't have to rap
Break Harry-O out tell him crack is back
That's nine five a bird take half of that
Import it, export it in cracker jacks
When you get to the projects, ask for Black
You know what you started with? Give him half of that
He gon give you 50 G's in a plastic sack
And I'mma give you 3,500 cash for that
Gotta keep your mouth closed or I'mma blast the mac
They won't believe you the whole world know that bastard rap
Once you're out of the throne, you can't have it back
Retirement home and ain't nothing after that
Except you layin' in a casket, black suit on
You can't go to heaven with Timberland boots on
No subliminals, I ain't talkin to you Shawn
I'm talkin to that heartless mouse with no jewels on
Who the fuck put you on
Faggot ass nigga let men toss his salad like croutons
I fuck with Fab, get my DJ Clue on
Sit inside Hot 97 with no tools on
And it don't matter if it's Sway or Kay Slay
Angie Martinez I'll take 'em back to KDAY
They act like they forgot about Dre-day
I don't rap for Free that's why they fired AJ
It's me leaking through your stereo
Envy me as an MC, prepare for your burial
I kill niggas without lettin' the Desert blow
Razor tongue and I'm far from Haitian son
All black like the Range Rover wheels
Niggas whisper around The Game like The Game won't kill
Let me show you the scars, take you back to the car
Rewind time, March 3, 1994
I was only in my teens, deuce-deuce in my Levi's
When Nas hit the scene I was still rockin' knee-highs
Runnin' with my brother Fase, he was 17
Two guns in the upper waist, so we hit the block
Saw niggas from a rival gang bumpin Dre
Ran up on the '64 and that's all she wrote
We runnin through the alley like Bishop chasin' Radames
First murder and I did that without a mask
Fast-forward, see Game gettin out a Jag
Two piece suit on, he still got his rag
Gangbangin' forever, he still got his swag
Let me catch you in Los Angeles without a pass
Everybody in New York know that you a fag
Come out the closet, show the world how to use a pad
Speakin' death on my red bandana
Naw, he couldn't have said that, so I raised my antennas
Look at my Nextel, got a call from Santana
That nigga a pussy, we just saw him in Atlanta
So I hopped on the first thing smokin' to Atlanta
Pulled up at 112 ran up on that black Phantom
Security hopped out, no Joe in here
Just Outkast gettin' ready for a show in here
So I uncocked the .44
Hopped in the cherry low-low
Chrome grill with the G-Unit logo
We watched Hov go, now the world waitin for my solo
I'm the man, Stat Quo know
I ain't gotta explain, even Bo know
Half of these rap niggas is faker than rolls gold
Get hit in the face with the back of the .44
And pissed on tryin to play The Game with a broke nose
My bitch harder than you, yeah Vida loco
I ain't sold one record got rap in a chokehold
I'm Dre certified like the leader of the band
Run up, you sure to die, I'll leave you where you stand
Smurf-ette runnin around New York like he the man
But he peed in his pants when he saw us at Summer Jam
Lucky I wasn't there, I had to bury my man
Or I would've terrorized New York like the Son Of Sam
""What you mean terrorize New York?""
I mean expose these pussy ass niggas like I'm Too $hort
Somebody tell Domination I'll leave him in parts
Leg in Jersey, arm in Brooklyn, head buried in Central Park
He can't walk through New York no more like John Stark
Got a call cause I'm a break his ankles like Hot-Sauce
Ask niggas from your hood I'm thorough in 5 boroughs
Sit on any stoop, Pelli Tims in the thermal
Wait till Alpo come home
Like Azie from Harlem, Dre gon' pay me regardless
Cause he know Jay-Z departed
And these other rap labels know don't feed they artists
Talkin blueprint shit you got three garages
Gettin money off Roc like little E and Carter
Showin off your little chain like these is flawless
Send him 50 cent a day I can see he starvin'
I got R&B bitches givin' me ménages
Deep massages, I could hear Eazy talkin
Tellin me to have a seat in Tomica's office
Buy Ruthless and get Lil' E involved in
Promote without that magazine in Boston
Take a couple mil, make Beans a offer
Give him money we don't see that often
But it was all a dream, like I seen Memph Bleek in Marcy
I ain't say you won't see Bleek in Marcy
I said my man told me he don't see Bleek in Marcy
I'm from Compton where niggas used to bleed for Barkley's
Drive lo-lo's and we ain't need keys to start 'em
Just a little information for your summer vacation
Bring your chain cause every nigga in L.A. waitin'
Mad cause Detroit beat the shit out the Lakers
And they'll kill you cause they can't find Gary Payton
Meanwhile the throne vacant and Da Band ain't makin' it
Shyne got a new deal, Def Jam gotta pay us
Playboy Jones got knocked out shortly after they weighed him in
Niggas got beef with G-Unit but ain't sayin' shit
Quiet as a church on Tuesdays
Niggas say they hate my music, but my alert's on they 2-ways
Nigga I'm a hazard like Michael Jackson in khakis
Touch kids but I do that with a semi-automatic
With or without traffic I pull my shit out and blast it
I'm blind to the masses like Stevie Wonder without glasses
I'm a savage spit murder like a .38 Magnum
16 bars'll baggum let the hook toe tag 'em
Murder any MC throw 'em in that white wagon
Let him die and come back look at 'em, he white flaggin'
Spreadin' rumors like, ""When I see Game I might jack him""
I'm tellin' the world: he reach for my chain, I might clap him
Cause niggas shot me in 2001
Took one in the heart cause I was too proud to run
The clip was empty when the police found my gun
So I don't bring that gangbangin' shit around my son
Nigga 50 took 9 he know how it feel
And I found out Buck got shot up in Cashville
And Sha Money told me Lloyd Banks got hit
And Yayo just came home (G-G-G-Unit)
Backstage at a D-12 concert
A fan asked me how it feel to be walkin in Snoop's Converse
Niggas show me love when they see me in the streets
But they frown when I don't want to hear none of they beats
Nigga, this shit crazy
Em said some shit when was 16, now they tryin to ruin Slim Shady
I forgive him, I got problems of my own
How you think the streets gon' act now that Suge got home
These niggas is birds, I can see the feathers on 'em
If Doc give me the word, I put this Berretta on 'em
When the beef is on, my piece is on
White sheets is on 'em, Doc breathin on 'em
And I got an extra clip in my Reeboks
Cause I'm in and out my socks every time I see cops
Game got the streets locked
Call 911, get the whole fuckin LAPD shot
Niggas snitchin' to the street cops
Get your nephews and your niece shot
When my heat cocked, then the beat stop
Nigga with a attitude like I heard Dr. Dre doin' ""Detox""
Niggas fightin' for the throne that ain't shit
Tryin to measure the fallin' legends but the shoe won't fit
Niggas might think I'm ridin' dick
Cause I'm at the cemetery puttin creases in my G-Unit's
Tryin to talk to Jesus Christ into lettin' me dig 'em up
So they could stand side by side again and live it up
This might be the last time you hear me biggin 'em up
With ""Suicidal Thoughts"" bangin' me and my bitch in the truck
My conscience tellin' me if I put the clip in the buck
It might be loud enough to wake B.I.G and them up
What if that was P. Diddy sittin' in the truck
And 2Pac was in jail the day he recorded ""Hit 'em Up""?
I wouldn't be outside 40/40 bumpin' Jigga What
Wouldn't be signed to Dr. Dre, I wonder is it luck
They got me on MTV with Banks, Fifth, and Buck
I ain't tryin' to be L.A.'s king, he carry a pimp cup

Snoop Dogg got the crown, nigga
What the fuck y'all mad at me for?
I ain't sold one fuckin' record
I'm just tryin' to use these 200 bars to feed my family, nigga
I ain't no threat
I can't rap, I'm from Compton remember?
You gotta be out your motherfuckin' mind
Ask Kay Slay, ask Clue, ask Whoo Kid, ask Funk Flex
I'll murder anyone of you motherfuckers

Nigga, this that 90 miles per hour on the freeway, nigga
This that motherfucking black hoodie shit, my nigga

Now we been baptized in a gunfire
These cops round here too motherfucking one sided
They fucking liars
Every time I hear these motherfucker's sirens blaring
I wanna put something through that badge
Hollow tips in your power steering
We say fuck cops and then them gun shots
All night we ducking them buck shots
We hear pop-pop! Nigga hop-pop!
You ain’t strapped then homie why the fuck not?
Hearing guns cock, we hear one shot
It's a moment of silence for the whole block
Cause when one of us gone, it's like we all gone
Fuck that, yo I'm ready to fight!

Cause I'm so tired of this same old shit
Feeling like I ain't got not rights
Every time I turn around them red and blue lights
Always fucking up my night
And me wanna load up and put all you pretty motherfuckers up in my sight
All up in my sight

You done fucked up now
You done crossed that line
Wait till I come back

Y'all thought that shit was fine
Till that shit go (braow!)

All this blood on the streets man, fuck the police

And unite like ""Fuck the police!""
(better hug yo wife
Man fuck yo life!
Payback, payback)

I done lost my fucking son because of this bullshit
Now I'm at the pulpit because of what I did with that full clip
And the judge and the jury, so fucking full of shit
Do you know how many times
These mutherfuckers try to pull this shit?

And it's fucking murder
Hide behind your badge and get away with it
Thought it was protect and serve
But half the time that's really not the way it is
But you niggas got it coming
And you so outnumbered
It's bout to be a cold ass summer

Born 2 Rap,Born 2 Rap,2019.0,"I remember I was rappin' for a year and a half
Couple tears in the glass
Some gunshots then I appeared on the map, bust it
In the studio, way in the back with Busta
Next mornin' back to weighin' the crack, fuck it
What if Dre don't make an album out my demo?
At least me, Snoop, and Nate Dogg smoked some indo
Mel-Man told me, ""Be patient,"" thanks for the info
Next thing I know, I'm in Hits Factory with Timbo
Came back and threw the Range on Lorenzos
I'm reminiscin', lookin' out this Lamborghini window
My Granny told me I'd be bigger than Nintendo, Game
Let the top down so she could scream her grandson name
We on our way back to the nursin' home listenin' to Just Blaze beats to put these verses on
My life almost got cut short on the 'Math, 'til Jigga told Dre ""Hate it or Love it"" was a smash

I sit alone in my room in the zone writin' classics

I sit alone in my room in the zone writin' classics
Who rap better than me?
I sit alone in the room in my zone writin' classics
Who do it better than me?
Who rap better than me?

Shit sound like I found the Fountain of Youth
It's like the bald-head Game steppin' back in the booth, true
I'm the only nigga rap like I do, proof
Who survived after 300 Bars, who?
Nobody, I'm still countin' these bodies
Still countin' these millions
Still make everybody quiet when I walk in the lobby of that Interscope buildin'
I still drop one line and have 'em all in they feelings
I know you miss me but I just been in Calabasas
Bought the crib far just to stop from whoopin' nigga's asses
I'm the definition of classic
I'm the feelin' fans used to get when they rip the shit up out the plastic
How many legendary studios got my plaques in it?
New Lambo truck, let's see if I can start from scratch in it
And I started from the bottom of the block
Hate it or love it the underdog still on top, nigga

Game was always open arms
You know what I mean?
And, you know, he was the only one for a while
Yeah
From the-from the generation after the Snoop, Dre, Pac
So Game was-he held the position of-everybody looked to Game
For-for, you know, ""Hey, listen to my tape, woo""
And I actually met Game in my hood on Crenshaw and Slauson
And I was outside on the block with like twenty of my homies
And, um, I see the Range Rover, I'm like, ""That's Game right there""
And we all walked up to his car and I handed him my CD
And on my daughter, he had a Glock on his, on his hip
I mean on his lap
And that's what made me like, I ain't gon' say made me respect Game
I respect Game off all the things he done
But when we met, you know what I'm sayin'?
It was um, I was in the middle of my hood, you know, with all my homies before rap
And Game was drivin' through solo with a, with a Glock in his lap

Breakfast with Al Pacino,OKE: Operation Kill Everything ,2013,"The other day I had breakfast with Al Pacino

Told him I wish he was in Casino

Fresh out the kitchen with waffles and cappuccino (Hood nigga)
Eating breakfast with Al Pacino (Wass good, nigga?)
Please

My life a movie directed by Tarantino, my Lambo loungin' the kimo
I’m at that fork in the road like a torturous Hov
I ain’t wanna sell blow, I was forced to that stow
See, I was forced to be hard without multiple goals
So I multiplied and magnified that coke 'til I was satisfied
Took oath in my last supply, I kept my tenants classified
My mama ain’t know, nah
My daddy and my uncles gave me bundles
Put it on bees, I made it bumble
Bred 11’s
, thou should not stumble
In bed by eleven, that’s where she thought but I’m in a jungle
Sayin' no, this ain’t no trainin' day
I’m on that track, but I put them trains away
And my enemies on this train today
My dreams is where them bangers lay
The sky is where my fingers stay
Unless I bring the K and choppers makin' rainy day
Niggas praying to Yeezus
Remember before we was famous, Ye?

And if you must know, nobody’s perfect
We screw up, we make mistakes
Have heart breaks, go through hard times
But you need to know that’s life
The world ain’t full of assholes
But they strategically placed
So that you could come across one every day
You know what I’m sayin'?
Sometimes things that happen in life are not part of a plan
But when that happens, don’t give up on your dreams
Just find another way to reach 'em
Just givin' you food for thought, ladies and gentleman
Worryin' won’t stop the bad from happenin'
But it will stop the good from being enjoyed

Niggas want me to D-I-E-, been there, done that
Woke up from a coma on 3 I.Vs
Eyes on the throne, somebody in my seat
Fiddlin' with rap like Miri Ben-Ari
I scoop up Swizz, drive thru' the Bronx
And get Jada on the phone My next stop is Yonkers
After that its Harlem, (Why?) 'Cause im a certified gangsta
And Jim Jones' throwin a blood party
Red bandanas from 93rd to 115th and Lennox

I bet I love you more than he can

Wake up, break up, make up, play fuck
Lay up, no sleep, no sex, say less
Get dressed, then trade up
Two cribs, revolvin' doors, A.M., P.M
I'm in, I'm out, she stressed, she saw a DM
And I'm still not a player, but you still a hater
Elevator to the top, hah, see you later, I'm gone
New A.P., pimped out piece
In-house cheeks, Z-4 pimped out seats
Penthouse suite, lease with an option to buy
Coppin' the five-oh Benz, for when I'm not in the sky
Puffin' a lot, sippin' on that Clicquot
Up in the Benz, Heathrow with this freak ho
Drippin' like I'm G Perico
I ain't a player but I crush a lot
When I'm inside a designer, eyeliner turn to tears when I touch the spot
Throw up the Duss', I'm about gettin' loot
And I knock them boots on that Roosevelt roof
I don't wanna be a player no more
I'm not a player, I just crush a lot
Game and Til are lit and still got what you lookin' for
Stay down, stay down, stay down

'Til the mornin', 'til the evenin' (Evenin')
I give you real love, when you need it (When you need it)
If he was decent, wait 'til you see this (Yeah)
I bet I love you more than he can (More than he can)
'Til the mornin', 'til the evenin'
I give you real love, when you need it
If he was decent, wait 'til you see this
I bet I love you more than he can

I don't wanna be a player no more
Game and Til are lit and still got what you lookin' for
Stay down, stay down, stay down
I don't wanna be a player no more
Game and Til are lit and still got what you lookin' for
Stay down, stay down, stay down
Stay down, stay down, stay down
Stay down, stay down, stay down
Stay down, stay down, stay down",https://genius.com/The-game-stay-down-lyrics
The Soundtrack (1992),1992,2016.0,"Cars drive by in the night

Maybe I should move a little, smoke a little
Fuck around, get high a little
Start reminiscin' about the old times
12 years old, cars drivin' by with gangsters in it
You ain't stand too long
'Cause you already knew that it was gangsters in it, nigga
Yeah when everythin' was copacetic
'Til niggas got off them 40 ounces
That's when even the Pope can get it
Chronic smoke all in the air, ain't nobody playin' fair
And Snoop Dogg had all these niggas
Around here tryna braid they hair
Red and blue, khaki suits
Us lil niggas got active too
From Lincoln Park, back to the Fruits
Us lil niggas had ratchets too
So what you sayin' nigga? We ain't playin' nigga
We kill your daddy and let your mama do all that prayin' nigga
Lose your fuckin' life when them

My mama was a gangster nigga
My daddy was just a gangster nigga
Wasn't for them, I wouldn't be from Compton
I should probably thank them niggas
Taught me how to shoot, rob, kill
How to shank a nigga
Maybe I should blame them for all these cases
When I done banked a nigga
AKs out of M3's, prostitutes on bent knees
Gun shots on Greenleaf, all these 64s, no Bentleys nigga
Euros on Cutlasses, you can't rent these niggas
'Bout to do a drive-by tonight, that's why we tint these nigga
Heard shots rang out, just ridin' on my 10 speed
Seen the windows down and the bitch squeezed
Nigga almost died tryna get some weed
So don't be fooled by the palm trees
This Compton nigga
, 
that 310
That 213, we on Death Row
Ain't no one escape unless you D-R-E
And that's how I felt when them

Dr. Dre 2,The R.E.D. Album,2011.0,"In Compton, you either a blood or a crip
Nigga ain't no one in between
Shit was a hard decision for him to make, cause both his parents was crips
His Uncle Greg was a crip, he died when he was 5
His brother Jevon was a Crip, he got murdered when he was just 13
After that he decided that being a crip just wasn't for him
So he ran across the tracks until everything turned red
And never looked back",https://genius.com/The-game-dr-dre-2-lyrics
Camera Phone,LAX,2008.0,"Picture me and my gangsta girl, riding with the top back
Bangin Ne-Yo, my neck freeyo, my sox hat
Tilted to the side like you know I get my grind on
Get my shine on
Jewelry Black in all rhinestones
Rims spinning like a globe, on these low pros
Do it big cause im supposed to floss
And thats the reason she break me off
Cause I'm gangsta
And I'm ridin wit..

Ne-Yo, its a thug and a gentleman
Rollin like a boss through
No matter the cost too
Not tryin' to brag but money's not an issue
Don't let your girl see us
That might make her diss you
Cause if she roll wit us
She won't even miss you

Pop rubber bands when I throw a stack
Before it hit the ground she throw it back
When I make it rain thats chump change
That pay for the 26 on my range range range drive drive
Take the wheel while I roll and slide
Climb over to the passenger side and freeze

And once again its on
You should take a picture with your camera phone
Playa she not comin home
And if im on her screen saver, that, that mean later we gone
If I let her take a picture

All of them want, my girl

Homie don;t mess with mine
Do a song wit suicide

She call me Jay, I call her B
We gettin married, to the streets
I'm chasin money, she chasin me
I'm right where I wanna be
With the B on my Bentley
The horse on my Lambo
Crown on my Cadillac
Checks on my Air Max
Haters, better fall back
Before I put somin in your ball cap
Thats my chick, I got her back like a bra strap
Cause she fine and she cute
She think she all that, and she all that
Thats my girl thats my world

Bloody Moon,Blood Moon: Year of the Wolf,2014.0,"Never been so hurt
There was no one to care
Since my very first breath on Earth
There was no one ever there

My father left me when I was seven, at a home
Left me but took his chrome, I looked up and blood was gone
Man, fuck it, guess in the world I'm all alone
My mother was too naïve so when he left she followed along
And while you're listenin' to this song, askin' yourself why
It's really none of your business but I was there, I bear witness
To a grown fuckin' man with a beard
Unzipped his pants and I can't tell you what appeared
Me and my sister had different fathers, but I cared, and I loved her
And I'd be lyin' if I told you I wasn't scared, when he rubbed her
Tip of his penis on her, she was only 11
How could you ever get a boner?
Even thinkin' about it make me hot as a sauna
Make me wanna pop him like the top on Coronas
But I was scared, ran back to my room, prayed to God
That I was dreamin', can't believe I'm this nigga's semen
Livin' with demons and it'd been that way

Never been so hurt
There was no one to care
(Don't give a fuck about me)
Since my very first breath on Earth
There was no one ever there
(Don't give a fuck about me)

These niggas can't fuck with this shit
I'll make you slit your wrist
This, sort of like the exodus
It's, you see it
The moon bleedin', it's a bloody moon
You see it
It's a bloody moon
You see it
It's a bloody moon
The moon bleedin', it's a bloody moon

Never been so hurt

Better on the Other Side,UnKnown,2009.0,"I remember the first time I seen you moonwalk (Oh woah)
I believed I could do anything (Oh, ooh)
You made the world dance
You made the music come to life (Woah, oh woah)

This the type of song that make the angels cry (Mike Jack)
I look up in the sky and I wonder why? (Why?)
Why you had to go, go, I know it's better on the other side (You were the greatest)
You were chosen from the start (Chosen, oh), never gon' let you go (Oh, oh, oh, God chose you, will never forget you)
It's from my heart, woah-oh (The King, we miss you)

Who's Michael Jackson? You're Michael Jackson
I'm Michael Jackson, we all Michael Jackson
I guess what I'm askin' is, everybody bow their head for a legend, don't breathe for a second
Now let the air out, grab the hand of somebody you care about
So you can hear my message, my confession, somebody tell Usher
I seen the moonwalk, I guess the young thriller touched him
Like he touched me, like he touched you
So carryin' his legacy, somethin' I must do
And I trust you lightin' candles, concrete visuals
Me and my brothers listen to Jackson 5 in the livin' room
First thing I did when I heard, was call Puff
'Cause him and Mike tried to stop the beef between us
Who was us? Me and 50, that beef is dead
Him and Mike Jackson gonna take us to the ledge

This the type of song that make the angels cry
I look up in the sky and I wonder why?
Why you had to go, go, I know it's better on the other side (Ooh yeah)
You were chosen from the start, never gon' let you go
It's from my heart, woah-oh (Oh, oh)

As I'm pourin' out this liquor, candles start to flicker
When list my Air Ones, MJ was my nigga
Not the one that play ball, the one with the Hollywood star
And since I'm a Hollywood star, I'ma tell you my story
Never had a family that close
Never see Berry Gordy walkin' through Interscope
But just like me, they always had Mike in a scope
No matter what you say, I'ma love him and he's still dope
Let me take you back to '85 when I was in a zone
Dancin' for my mama, 'Thriller' jacket with all the zippers on
Now i'm doin' 90, 'bout to crash in this Aston
Listenin' to Outkast, I'm sorry Ms. Jackson
Anythin' I can ever do to better you
Your son was our king so we won't Corretta you
I'm writin' this letter to all the Jackson kids
We all Jackson kids, time to let us through

This the type of song that make the angels cry (Oh woah)
I look up in the sky and I wonder why?
Why you had to go, go, I know it's better on the other side (Ooh yeah)
You were chosen from the start, never gon' let you go  (Oh, oh)
It's from my heart, woah-oh

People could say what they wanna say about you (Oh)
We gon' remember the miracles that you showed us (Oh)
Through your music, through your dance (Oh woah)
Through your philanthropy
You were the one that made us all realize that we are the world
You were the one to show us we can moonwalk (Yeah)
You gave us the beat (Hey)
Gave us the rhythm (Hey-ey)
Gave us the soul (Oh)
Through us, your legacy lives on (Anything)
You can't stop now, we won't stop now (Anything, oh)
Mike Jackson

This the type of song that make the angels cry (Oh woah)
I look up in the sky and I wonder why? (Why)
Why you had to go, go, I know it's better on the other side (Ooh yeah)
(Why'd you have to go, Mike? Okay)
You were chosen from the start, never gon' let you go  (Oh, oh)
(Wassup Chris?)
It's from my heart, woah-oh

This the kinda song that make the angels cry

Hard Liquor,Dretox,UnKnown,"Dre you must've been of the Hennessy when you did this my nigga

Hard liquor
Hard liquor
Hard liquor
Is there anymore hard liquor
Make sure that it's mixed
And twisted with a little bit of lemon juice
On ice, on ice, on ice, Yeah

You know me I turn them 40 bottles upside down
Like niggas with dead homies till it's empty like my four pound
Niggas thinkin' I'm drunk, reach for my N.W.A chain
And get your ass beat with the pump
Tell security it's Game plus 50
Any problem he get fucked up every night like Bobby do Whitney
Fuck poppin' Cristal I got a bottle of Henny
Me and my nine stay together like Hardaway and Lil Penny
I ain't here so you can ask about Em or Dre
I came to see some bitches shake their ass like Beyoncé
So let me be Hov' for a minute, get up in your ho for a minute
And you could be my ho for a minute
Like I'm Diddy, be J-Lo for a minute
From the windows to the wall gettin' low while I'm in it
All I gotta do is hit em with a JAY-Z line
Like you deserve to be my sunshine

See her on the Floor, she's sexy
Tell her where the after party is
But make sure that you see her friends before her
Before her, before her, hmm

I'll spend a hundred dollars take a bitch to the hyatt
Then treat her like Busta like her ass on fire
I'm a gangsta ma' I wanna see you wiggle your butt cheeks
Both hands round your ankles ma'
All I wanna see is ass and tits
Shake it like they do in magic city with T.I. in that mothafucka
I'm like 50, be high in this mothafucka
You see them gold Ds on that Porsche Truck
I show you how gangstas fuck
My .45 to the back of your weave, both of your arms in handcuffs
Take a bottle of Cisco to the head, see how you like getting fucked with a pistol to your head
Tell ya' girls how I fucked your brains out we can do a manage-a-trois, pull the whips and chains out
I tear that frame out I ain't no stunt man
I pull that range out, bitch

See her on the Floor, she's sexy
Tell her where the after party is
But make sure that you see her friends before her
Before her, before her, hmm

I got 40's like the liquor store
Pour it on your weave like that bitch in the G-Thang video
You look wet, let me help you out your Von Dutch's
I know you used to niggas spendin' but tonight I'm fuckin'
The truck stop, the rims spin, I know they hate me fuck 'em
It's killa-Cali nigga, haters come a dime a dozen
Load them shells then I get drunk pissy
This bottle of Hennessy got me wantin' to fuck Missy
I'm a gangsta I can turn that bitch out
Play with her pussy then drop ecstasy in her Cristal
60 seconds later I'm kickin' that bitch out
Then ride down the show with the .45th out
Stop at the store that bitch emptied my Cris out
Give me 50 feet or I'll empty this clip out
Niggas wanna know what this L.A. shit 'bout
Just visit when the Bloods and Crips' up

Is there anymore hard liquor
Make sure that it's mixed
And twisted with a little bit of lemon juice

Yo killa B, drop it right here, c'mon

Operation kill everything, kill everything
Married to myself, fuck a wedding ring
Tried that shit twice, gave that girl everything
She a good woman, she got good goals
Love her to death but can't be in that fishbowl
Niggas gotta live and what the fuck does it matter if I take care of my kids
I got three of them little niggas
And every time they smile I see me in them little niggas
I get my heart I get my soul and nobody fucking with me till Harlem 20 years old
And that day I'm gon' retire, look back at my career
Like I started from the bottom, Now I'm mofuckin' here
Look back at my career like I started-
Started to do something, shit I've been working out for two summers
In the gym Ipod on Cruel Summer
When everybody dope in your clique you do numbers
But I ain't got no clique
Still got the same cars, and broads sucking my dick
Still fuck the same stars that (uh) up in my six
Still finding old panties and bras up in my whip
This bitch got my dick hard as Roc Nation
That's like Cole and Hov at a show keeping fans waiting
And you know they ain't go do that
Girl go and do that
Guess it's time to turn up
I got a whole lot of marijuana to burn up
And I ain't mean to make you stop

I'm just gettin' back from Vegas
Yeah man, party was off the chain
Well, I'm back in sunny California
And it never rains in southern California
Yeah yeah yeah all that man
So I decided to throw this white party man
So I'm up at the mansion right now
I just emptied out the pool, filled it up with Aquahydrate
So you know when the chicks is in the pool, they correctly balanced
And also, we got the Ciroc fountains overflowin'
Blue dot, red dot, white dot
Man I want you to come and bring the whole crew
Bring that west coast love, the all white party man
And we goin' to leave colors at home, I know you wanna wear all red man
But you gotta wear all white to this one man
And tell Snoop that too, he gotta wear all white to this one man
I see ya'll at the white party at the mansion man
Hey yo, let's get it
Love
Hey yo, Chuck for real, wear all white
Lucky this Ash, I got this fire ass kush from my cousin
I'mma come over and smoke it later, aight? Aight
Hey Lucky, this Andrea
Just comin' from this bitch Ashley house
I'm bout to suck the skin off yo dick, and she ain't e'en know it
Fuck she just say?!
Hey Lucky, this Andrea
Just comin' from this bitch Ashley house
I'm bout to suck the skin off yo dick, and she ain't e'en know it

I guess we going to Diddy's
It ain't a party without the king of the fucking city
Handsome ass nigga these bitches is fucking with me
Woke up in that new Bugatti these pigs ain't fuckin' with me
I'm like Dr. J with his fro
Something like Boston George with the blow
Pumping white how I got it just so you know
Slummer light how I'm zipping up all this dough
Summer nights we at Toxic with all these hoes
Then we back at the mansion take off them clothes
I let my niggas hit it first I'm in and out
Just as quick as niggas spit a verse then they out
Then I'm back to the booth
Rollin' up sipping some 80 proof
And I dont chase the liquor or these hoes
Heard Jordan got some new shit out, Boog order those
Just bought me a Ghost like where the Rolls
Perrier Jouët, supperclub with all my bros
Can't get none of my bitches to wear they clothes
Plus I sit back and still get paid like Derrick Rose

Shit was all good just a week ago
About to start snitchin', ain't you?
Ready to start bitchin', ain't you?
I forgive you, I forgive you
Hustlin' just ain't you

If you listenin' to this now that mean Swizzy got it cleared for me
2018, what a fucked up year for me
Take it back to January, nigga lost his father
Only way I got through it was bumpin' Wayne's first Carter
With the speakers blarin', windows down on my McLaren
See the wheels and it's apparent, this why these fuck niggas starin'
Had a premonition, parked and got out, Calabasas far
Triple X, Biggie, Pac, niggas kill rappers in cars
That was back in June
I missed out on a couple million, gotta get back in tune
I wake up, work out, hit the studio right after noon
Still gotta pack a tool to pick my kids up after school
Don't put me in no situation where one of us niggas have to lose
'Cause you'll be in a casket soon
Closed tighter than Mac and Tune
Another classic with no Jigga verse, it'll happen soon
Go bar-for-bar with Jigga
Last wish of a young spitter even if the verse is killer

That is not how I die, I seen my death
Seen all you niggas' demise, folded hands on your chest
Always put my niggas first, they pray for my last breath
Thought I did niggas right, 'til niggas start goin' left
Gucci flip flops, ten toes down where I stood
Gucci flip flops, nigga, I done got it from the mud
Gucci flip flops, hoppin' over fences 'cause I could
In Gucci flip flops, never switchin' sides on the hood
Gucci flip flops

Still listenin'? I want y'all to picture this
Me and you tradin' lives, now tell me what the difference is?
More money, more problems
And more niggas who wanna kill you
More empty Patrón bottles
And I don't condone violence but niggas on phones wildin'
Niggas on apps cappin', them choppers at full volume
I put money on niggas' books, got houses out foreclosure
One call'll open fire on niggas and force closure
I'm too O.G. for this shit
Built my career off the rock, Memph' Bleek in this bitch
Comin' of Age, even squashed my beef with Meek for this shit
Get off the phone, stop speakin' and shit
Soon as 12 close the door on you niggas, mouth leakin' and shit
Go to jail, cut a deal, can't do a week in that bitch
That's why I stay away, somewhere on a beach with a bitch
Watchin' Narcos, listenin' to The Weeknd and shit

And this is not how I die, I seen my death
Seen all you niggas' demise, folded hands on your chest
Always put my niggas first, they pray for my last breath
Thought I did niggas right, 'til niggas start goin' left

Crouch down low, with a pocket full of money
Shooting dice in my white 1's
Roll another seven of the nike on my white 1's
I had a jumper, plus I was pumpin'
Moms and pops was both gangsters any drama I will slump 'em
How the fuck you think I got the name Game
Same way them Lakers got all of them fucking rings, hustlin'

Hustlin' drop top, chain swing

They was like, that's our little brother don't fuck with him
They shot 'em both so, I was like fuck it then
Called up the homies ""I'm ready, nigga jump me in
Hopped in the G-ride, same one the pump be in

Fav bar? Reasonable Doubt over
Before that day, we ain't know shit about hova
He was talking Cristal, and 4.6 Rovers
But all we knew were 5.0s and Toyotas
So, we took y'all swag y'all took our rags
The way I see it, it's a fair exchange, why you mad?
Son, Yeah Jay was one of my teachers
Bumpin' Roc-A-Fella but, couldn't get a feature
Was like, being underage and couldn't get a beeper
Missing sales cause the onions still stuck in my sneaker
Tucking the street sweeper, dodgin' the grim reaper
Hit my block after 8 o'clock, I'll make you a believer
We was movin' white kid, the Justin Beiber
Us and homeless shelters no different, we both feed 'em
Playing John Madden, smoking all my nigga weed up
Relaxin' with my feet up, waiting for the re-up

Keep on trying

If I go to jail you nigga ain't gone throw a dolla at me
Like my nigga Frogg, threw his Impala at me
Like when I was in the bay and 40 popped his colla at me
That's why when I come through, she look like Halle Berry
I'm in this Game by myself, solitary
Every now and then, you my see me with a couple friends
Same ones that was right there, when I had a couple ends
No fuckin' Benz, no fuckin' house
Just a fuckin' couch, so shut your fuckin' mouth
Before I zip it up, say fuck rap
Fuck Interscope, take my contract and rip it up
Aftermath's bad boy, like Big and Puff
The giant can't sleep 'cause niggas steady tryin' to dig him up
And while you motherfuckers waitin' on Toronto
I'm in the 'hood with Pancho, stackin' Rajon Rondo

Hustlin' championship rings
Hustlin' metaphor street king
Hustlin'

And while you motherfuckers waitin' on Toronto
I'm in the 'hood with Poncho, stackin' Rajon Rondo
Keep on trying
You can never hold me down
You can never hold me down (you can't hold me)
You can never hold me down (you can't hold me)

Swish, twenty-four, that's Black Mamba
Snoop Dogg, he’s a dope rhymer
Collaborate with the Golden State
In a yellow six deuce with the purple plates
I dip and dodge
I hit three and roll
Fish and chips
Bounce pass down to Pau Gasol
We don't give a damn about the big three
LA Lake show we bout to three-peat
And you can bet, that's on the set
Ron Artest about to get wet
I'm on the flo’ and thats a fact
Sittin’ next to uncle Jack blazin’ up the purple sack


Louboutin don
Purple twenty-fours, yellow Lambo I'm ridin’
Top blew the guts doors goin’ suicide
Stuff in the wood, niggas know we gon kill that
Blow it in the air boy, know they gon feel that
Purp and yellow, purp and yellow
Watch me ball like you sittin’ where Phil at
Ten car caravan Aston Martin’s and all them hood whips
Them Cutlass’s them Cadillacs’s that leather be grippin’ them wood tips
I was born up in The Wood
Claim Compton bet you ain't know that
Pops taught me how to get low in the floor clap
Went from a boy to a king
Any block I five five four that
Nigga better know that
Boy they playin’
Sawed off shotty
What they sayin’
Nothin' to a boss
I put two holes in that LaCoste
I come through fuckin' niggas off
Hop in that truck and get lost
You playin' with a king not Gretzky
Even if you let me
Keep your girl wetter than Game on a jet ski
Ooo cool, who say he smoother than a baby’s ass
Pops was a dope boy we still spendin' 80′s cash
Look on that Mercedes dash, boy you know what it is
Blowin' on a scarecrow on my way to see the Wiz


Ridin’ down Rosecrans, Compton, California
Turn on the wrong street they might bang on ya
Home of the Lakers baby, yea you know its purp and yellow
Take a hit of what I got
I bet it have you seein' doubles
But I’m an angel though
And your girl's a pigeon
It's money over everything
Girl you know the vision
Never been a mark if you with it we can cut your fade
Brought out fifty
Blew up the city, young Saddam Hussein
Pusha Ink the label baby
Everything else is fuckin' boring
I’m at Roscoes eatin with some chick's who foreign

No Smoke,Born 2 Rap,2019.0,"Guess who back in the buildin', stackin' them millions
Y'all wanted me to rap, I'm bringin' back that feelin'
Bridge the gap between mumble rap and these killers
Bridge the gap between smokers and lean sippers
These niggas make records to please niggas
I make records every second to shelter and feed niggas
What is hip-hop these days, jealousy and greed, nigga?
Champagne bottles and IG models that tease niggas?
I smoke weed to keep my mind at ease, nigga
Dr. Dre planted this Chronic seed, nigga
Y'all don't want no smoke with me, nigga
L.A. is a hot box, it's hard to breathe in it
Got hives all over my city with bees in it
No traffic, they'll swarm to the club in three minutes
And if they late, I bob and weave niggas
Always whippin' niggas ass, feelin' like I'm in a Creed, nigga

They don't want no Chronic smoke with me
They don't want no Chronic smoke with me
Puff, puff, pass
They don't want no Chronic smoke with me
They don't want no Chronic smoke with me

They don't want no Chronic smoke with me

My Documentary Grammy went to Missy
I learned my lesson then
Hip-hop'll take your heart no matter the type of vest you in
But I was vested in my legacy
And at the end, I could get shot like 'Pac and I felt like I was his next of kin
Had to kick the door down since niggas ain't wanna let me in
Tell 'em its Game but these hoes call me ESPN
Took Nipsey and Kendrick on tour, I had to set the trend
Before that, do you remember what condition the West was in?
Sittin' there, record playin', Swizz Beatz lecturin'
Pharrell told me, ""You gotta chill, God gave you a second chance""
Even though I respect my fam', don't move without the TEC in hand
And none of y'all nigga don't really want no smoke, not even second-hand
I'm from L.A. where even bitches pack an extra friend
And we make lil' niggas like Soulja Boy sneak our weapons in
F and Ns that drop one of your F'in friends
This kind of smoke'll make Red not wanna stand next to Method Man

They don't want no Chronic smoke with me
They don't want no Chronic smoke with me

They don't want no Chronic smoke with me

Running away from what was worse
Your love is burning me down

My mama in a coma, I don't know how to fucking feel
But what I do know is today my life fucking real
Holding my tears inside trying not to fucking squeal
Where is Jesus when I need him to grab the fucking wheel?
They say if it's fate it's fate, no ain't nothing seal
Staying strong when I really want to pop a fucking pill
Looking at my mama just laying here
Fuck hospitals blood I ain't staying here
Choked up, my mama all doped up
Make me wanna have all of my enemies scoped up
But my son just walked in, wanna see his grandma
But I can't let him see you like this, damn ma
What the fuck we doing? What the fuck we doing?
Something happen to you, my whole fucking life is ruined
Let the Lord take me from my fucking mama , I'mma kill myself
Break in heaven then it's goin' be drama


I don't never wanna know how Kanye feel
But right now I wouldn't mind seeing how a K feel
Fuck being Game, fuck being rich
Anybody that ever owe me money I feel like Money Making Mitch
I can't make dinner but I can make a fucking ditch
My pops ain't even checked on her , you a fucking bitch
Headed to Compton right now I'mma see you there
Matter fact it's better off, I just leave you there
And let you rot nigga, till you in a box nigga
From now on it's thug life I'm positive I'm Pac, nigga
Reakin' havoc on the world for what could be
I'm out here, dare any nigga try to Suge me
Who grew up in Compton? Who was born in Inglewood? Me
Two days left on Death-row is where I should be
But I'm right here waiting for her to wake up

You scrap niggas too animated like The Incredibles
Let this beef go around like the 26's
It's young Game of flame, welcome to the House of Pain
Nigga what about The Game?
Keep on playin boy, I'll hop out this fuckin Range
Look I ain't even ask for his fuckin chain
But he took it off like Vanessa-Del-Rio
Now I'm on my way to Rio

I see the coroner puttin' chalk around the snitch
We be shootin like free throws, flying them desert Eagles
Sell dope to the Po' while we eat chili Fritos
From a gang banger to a CEO
Everything I do is big like the nigga Ceaser-Leo
Won't stop till I'm dead
Ain't gotta watch for the Feds
They ain't watchin me so here's a dome shot to the head
As I take a Patron shot to the head
And reminise about the shit the D.O.C. said
""Get money, get cars, get mine, get yours
And keep your head up, like the Lambo doors""

I'm gone just like my Aftermath Chain
Don't make me take you back to '96
Leanin' on that Datsun on the corner eating catfish
The Game, da-da-da Game spit 'dat shit
I'm controversial like the Afro pic with the black fist
Just ask the rapper that had to catch my last diss
I'm reckless and I ain't never crash whips
My pops wasn't around so this bastard
Bleed California from the cradle to the casket
And I won't stop ridin' for my coast

Spider Loc is a joke
Nigga sound like chunk off the goonies
Ya life is a movie
You ain't a factor you a actor fifty gave you a script
Went from runnin with the bloods to a g-unit crip
What's a g-unit crip? not a gang in LA
Bang on records but nigga won't bang in LA
Why the fuck you wake me up. .. nigga I'm tired
You a busta, so I'mma light your ass on Fire
Nigga want my spot so he runnin with buck
Keep tryna play The Game, and u 'gon get fucked
I heard diss after diss, lil nigga you suck
Like yo baby mama, in the third row of my truck
Naw-vail ill whoop your ass in your own hood
You so hard why didn't u put out that song about Suge
Trapped in the closet, R. Kelly ass nigga
Get swiss cheesed up, ol' deli ass nigga
T.boz in belly ass nigga
Better ask around, I been the truth since Makaveli passed nigga
And I ain't wanna have to do this shit
I'd rather be at home listening to the Cam'ron diss
Dr. Dre said it best 'a bitch is a bitch'
You a myspace gangsta nigga suck my dick
Your flow is budweiser, mines is crystale
Put the faggot on ice he gon be there for a while
Now watch me put my chest out like 10 og's
I wore this G-unot shirt to show m.o.p
I'm gutter mutha fucka
Tell you fuck you to Fifty face, and won't st-st-stutter muthafucka
And now that I put the kids to bed
I tell you a story about a spider caught in his web
Marvel williams, a well known crip
Not cause he put in work, but cause his brother a snitch
He belong in g-unit, I'mma tell you the truth
Fifty, this nigga brother tell more than you
So I'mma break it down like an ounce of glue
I met this nigga spider at Alliyah video shoot
True, true, he had on no blue
Dmx start laughin he said 'this nigga think he better than you'
So I kicked a freestyle, and in the meanwhile
This nigga soakin up game tryna copy my style
Gave him a hundred bars, all he did was smile
And DMX named me the fuckin problem child
Now back to the future, you got a problem now
Snoopin around my hood, get fucked doggy style
I pull ya faggot ass out them g-unit sneakers
And let ya soul burn in hell on the anniversery to 'ether'
You g-unit crip, used to be a piru
Your name marvel, all you need now is a spiderman suit
Black wallstreet bitch you can't fuck wit my crew
My flow blind baby, I'mma make you do what it do
Lets take a ride Nigga I'mma make room in the coupe
Put the shovel in the truck, throw you in there too
Bitch in the passenger side, say she hear somebody screamin
Turn the music up.. baby that's comin from the speakers
She said I ain't trippin I hear somebody screamin
I had to throw her off so I start singin
I know you don't love me
You ain't the same when 50 Cent's in town
I know you don't love me
You always talkin' bout how Ma$e get down
I know you don't love me
You scream and holla when Spider Loc's around
Got me fucked up wit them g-unit crips
Tryna run game on me you punk bitch
Get yo ass in the trunk
Prodigy know that I ain't a punk
Keep these rap niggas in check like a pair of ducks
Who can flip like I do?
Spit like NaS too?
Rock a yankee fitted, still throw up piru?
Rock a dodger fitted in the middle of the bronx
I shine in any hood like paul wall fronts
Nigga my flow foolish sit back while I do this
Watch me manuever threw cedar block, and end up in hoover
I spit like a Ruger
You spit crap like a rookie dice shooter
Snake eyes to the loser
Nigga I'm grand pooba
Gave em somethin' grand nubian
Created g-unot, fifty tried to sue me and
Say he kick me out the group nigga I left
Spider, you want my spot nigga? clean up my mess
Dirty ass nigga, fifty give him a check
And if you sign, nigga put ya contract on the internet
I been bangin for 10 years, muhthafucka I been a vet
For 500 dollas he'll claim any set
Give him a 1000 dollars hell tat it on his hand... damn
That's worse than me lyin sayin olivia was a man
Ya XXL cover look like makin of the band
You mad, cause I got my own shoe
And my nigga take shots for the game like MJ do
Some say its bullshit till I pull quick
Till I empty a full clip
Get on the horn, meet me in the bullpit
Tony yayo you old ass coward
You 36 and 
u spit your hottest verse on my album
Now.. I ain't sayin that you dope nigga..
But you better than spider loc Nigga...
Fifty saw the opportunity and thought he could use him
I know he don't be listenin' to that wack-ass music
You got the west on your back? you a lyin bastard
You the reason niggas push mute when they play madden
What the hell made you think you could fuck wit the game
When yo claim to fame was Yukmouth's chain
Take my advice and lay low
Heard you and your uncle Yayo
Got ran the fuck outta san diego
I'll give you 5 shots when the 38 blow
Leave a hole in your chest.. the size of a bagel
We can do it when you say so
Wait till the Lakers on the road, shoot it out at the 
staples
Open your chest, show the world what you made of
My dick hard I can't wait till the day come

But my grandmother told me that she would pray for them niggas
They just young, black and ignorant, lusting over models and them Benjamins
Got the game twisted like (Like what?) Licorice
When I was rocking lottos, moving packs up out McDonalds
She was looking for me, pulled up in that old El Dorado
I was running around with chicks, chasing new black wheels
Why would I do that still? That's what got 2Pac killed
But I use that steel, cause I will do that deal
Screw the muzzle in potatoes of that new Mac Mill
What did I learn? Nothing, my pops smoking sherm, bluffin'
Beating on my moms like her head was a percussion
Tap tap, my .45 knocking on your window
She said it would be days like this, Pharrell, drop the instrumental

And I don't know my way

Swisher, crack a fifth up, Hennessy pouring like Niagara Falls
Used to watch Magic, he showed me how to ball
Moms working late night, to get our plate right
Had some older brothers, all we did was smoke and play fight
Wish I could go back to them days cause streets don't play right
Some niggas hard, other niggas was the Kid N Play type
But that ain't stop me pretending I was Apollo from Rocky
Working on my dip-game, now nobody wanna box me
Pick and choose, stick and move
So many dudes ended up with sleeping bags on late-night news
But not my mama's son, known around the hood for serving customers
She yapping in my ear, but it's louder than the muffler
But I didn't listen to, wish I would've trusted her
Wish I had a shovel, be digging both of my brothers up
Like, ""Here hug em, ma, one last time""
Put a chain on both of them niggas, they get one last shine

I know I must go
And I don't know my way
Still somehow I know I'll end up
Where we all came from (From my mama's womb)
I know I must go
And I don't know my way
Still somehow I know I'll end up
Where we all came from (From my mama's womb)

Put your Glock down, recognize a king cause it's my town
Word to my mother, you can throw up your rock now
Got off the beef shit cause I ain't tryna see my mama in all-black
Right there, crying over hard facts
Now she gotta turn in all her cars and get her house back, never!
She carried me for 9 months, so she can have whatever
Clever, she taught me how to shoot Berettas
Told me that I'd be a king, so R.I.P. to Coretta
If you don't understand that, then refer to my letter
While I sprinkle niggas with platinum from my last album
Got the check, so I signed on the X like Malcolm
Riding through the hood, you hating niggas like ""How come
That niggas Game got it? Heard he selling talcum""
Either way, playboy, check it, this is the outcome
You might not like it, but my mama psychic
Why you niggas twisted like the top of a Sidekick? (Played out)

I know I must go
And I don't know my way
Still somehow I know I'll end up
Where we all came from (From my mama's womb)
I know I must go
And I don't know my way
Still somehow I know I'll end up
Where we all came from (From my mama's womb)

One Life,Born 2 Rap,2019.0,"One life, nigga, one love
Reach them heights and keep goin' up
Hundred miles and runnin', we ain't slowin' up
15 Bentleys back to back, yeah, they know it's us
They know it's us
Hit them lights and come glow with us
Yeah, throw them dice and keep rollin' up
Had to earn them stripes when we was growin' up
Niggas see you make it out, they hate to show you love

I'm honestly a better man
An odyssey, a river ends
I gotta speak it from within
A lot of tree, a lot of gems

Bottle all that hate and bring it over here
Don't be scared, accept your fate, mind over fear
How many funerals I done been to after all these years?
Got it tatted on my face so I don't shed a tear
Just so we clear, niggas been hatin' on me my whole career
Catchin' fades while the little homies hold my beer
Had to move out of Compton, too much tension here
Glock on my lap, I'm in this Lamborghini switchin' gears
I been rappin' at this level for like 15 years
My nigga Pup had been in solitary my whole career
I know my purpose, kill any nigga that wanna interfere
Shoot that nigga, pick up the shell, keep it for a souvenir, yeah
It's hard to smile when you losin' peers
Paint on that Grand National lookin' like some new veneers
All black tint, they lookin' at it like, ""Who in there?""
This L.A., think twice before movin' here
You only got

One life, nigga, one love

I'm honestly a better man
An odyssey, a river ends
I gotta speak it from within
A lot of tree, a lot of gems

Yeah, sellin' my own taste to put food on the dinner plate
I used to curb syrup but it was better on that interstate
You could tell what's on my belt to know I'm heavyweight
My .45 compliment the Louis, I'm forever straight
I was grindin' on the steps just to make a profit
I was tryna get a check, I'm just bein' honest
We was taught to stay solid and remain loyal
My reputation good and my game royal
We was cookin' crack, makin' cocaine boil
Invade your block with my troopers like we came for oil
We gave up our childhood just to go on Slauson
When you see that yellow tape, nigga, you know it's caution
Nigga, you ain't been against all odds
Nigga, you ain't been to Crenshaw High, no, no
Nigga, you ain't never did drive-bys
Nigga, you ain't never seen shots fired, nope, quiet

The Cincinnati fitted made me a marked man
By the Parma blocks and 12 sittin' inside that parked van
Pacin' to the store, pocket full of hard tin
Let me get a Old English, yeah, the tall can
It really ain't no options when you born in Compton
Shoot at your opps and keep them cops out 'til they bring the SWAT in
They told Dre not to sign that nigga, ""He a hot head""
The Documentary went diamond, that's what brought Dot in
I'm a gangbanger, fuck your top 10
Tell your engineer make space and get your ass boxed in
I never fold
Under pressure, I ain't gon' never break
I never told
I never snitch, I never hesitate to pull my .9
Empty the clip, if I get caught, then I'ma do my time
I took the risk, count up my losses, I'ma die for mine
My kids first, my mama second
On my daddy grave, you don't wanna test it, nigga

One life, nigga, one love

Yeah, throw them dice and keep rollin' up
Had to earn them stripes when we was growin' up
Niggas see you make it out, they hate to show you love

My job is to, somehow, make them curious enough
Or persuade them, by hook or crook, to get more aware of themselves and where they came from
And what they are into and what is already there
Just to bring it out
This is what compels me to compel them
And I will do it by whatever means necessary",https://genius.com/The-game-one-life-lyrics

Real nigga, no Tony Parker
Your main bitch is my side-ho
Blowin' purp I'm high fi, redrum in that Mai Tai
Rubbing on the bitch tattas she scared of dick, Sci Fi
Hooked her up to that Wi Fi
Wiped my dick and said bye bye
Dropped the ho off at Pop Eyes and continued eating my hot fries
My old partner, AR said you a cold nigga
I simply said my day job my day job, ain't lovin' hoes nigga
Ask Juicy J about me

Every three hours need a re up from the weed man
Afghan purp strand super man head band
Eyes so tight got me looking like Jackie Chan
Me and the Game like Red and the Method Man
Smoking on the roach, you ain't really feeling that dope that you smoked
Try to mix lean with the blunt let it soak
All you gon' do is choke
Niggas can't handle weed from the west coast
Smoke so much till a nigga overdose
I stay high when I'm in and out the booth
Gotta thank Mary for this verse that I wrote
Big buzz in every club don't need a plug I am the plug
Taylor Gang, I'm on the plane
I'm leanin' man, I'm on them thangs
Only strong up in the bong, I've been high for way too long
Codeine I sip, hotbox the whip
I stay throwed, Cheech and Chong


Roll kush, fuck hoes, start fights, shoot niggas
How many niggas hurricane done killed, shit quite a few niggas
I'm like two Nas', two Jiggas, two Pacs, two Biggies
Cop the Rari for 250, then made the Rari do 250
Crash the Rari got two Bentleys
Blowing dank like two hippes
Give a nigga bout eight months in the gym
I'm gonna come through looking like two fifties
Half a mill on that xbox
John Madden probably owin' me
Ask Bow Wow, ask Fat Joe, ask Ocho they know me
On that 2k, I od

Fuck nigga put your money down
Start worrying bout when the fuck we gon' play
Put six bad hoes in one big room
Stuff six grams in one big blunt
Load six shells in one big pump
Stuff six chickens in one big trunk
Right next to a body, black John Gotti
Like a nigga shotty, hit em with the shotty
Fuck her good once then send her to the lobby
Fuck her so good momma looking for the body

While Jay kiss that ass goodbye, *mwuah*, locks
First shot, leave the niggas in shock
That second shot, that's when that body drop (Ya heard me?)
And niggas still askin' 'bout Detox
I'll tell you if you tell me who killed Pac
Aight then, I'm at this Pacquiao fight then, with Tyson
The way he's stickin', and movin' the knife, Floyd might win


Testarossa, keep an extra toaster
It's Hub city's finest, they respect the mostes

Heard about the new cat, I whipped the Range through that

Sittin' courtside with Drake, Hector and Rondo

My dick's too big, like my lifestyle, you fuck with that?
Poppin' champagne, we do the damn thing
Standin' on the couch, it's money Game, that's the campaign
Big in my pocket, Obama on my wrist
At the Ronald Reagan airport, yeah, I'm on my shit

C'mon! ... ARRRRRRRRGH!

Homey it's hard not to kill niggas; it's like a full time job
Not to pull out the steel and shove it in your grill
Young California got that mass appeal
I summons the hood, they get up in yo' ass for real
Knockout flow, Winky Wright jab for real
And all you niggas pussy, need Massengil
See I'm the gun-cocker, one-shotter, lift 'em off the ground
Chop 'em down, like a cantaloupe, My flow the antidote
Sick flow, it's so, motherfuckin six-fo'
Your bitch know, hop in the back when you see Swizz ho
Diss that, all you niggas get up off my dick so
I can cook crack on the track and watch it mix slow
Cocaine, my flow fire, call it propane
Every nigga know Game, five shots no pain
And that's the reason why I'm shittin on you niggas
Shut me in the looney bin, I'm sicker than you niggas

(ARRRRRRRRGH!)
This is that disrespectful, motherfuckin West coast
Hip-hop death blow, Swizz Beatz, let's go!

Where I'm from, I seen the most stand up niggas lay down
Where skinny niggas make buff niggas victims of that trey-pound
And gangbangers is the sharpshooters, we don't need no rooftops
Just knock his ass down and take the money out his tube socks
West Coast niggas is back on the map
If only for now until the next time I body a track
From the first clap I hurt rap, now watch the earth crack
Bring the hearse back, and take a lyrical dirt nap
I roll with the hardest niggas, make money with the smartest niggas
I ain't got time for you fuckin artist niggas
Better shut your trap before you become a target nigga
Y'all army brats I'm the motherfuckin sargeant nigga
Beauty pageant-ass niggas on the runway
+Boyz N The Hood+ 'til they see the nigga in that red Hyundai
Blow his fuckin back out, cause I'm the rap Stackhouse
Black Wall Street bitch, the hip-hop crackhouse, what?


My flow opposite of handsome, it's ugly
Hip hop tantrum, sick, call the shit cancer
One man show cause I fucked all the dancers
Let the critics ask questions, my album be the answer
These niggas let the rumors sit in they head like tumors
So I had to take 'em back, to toothbrush on the Pumas
Clean... mean... rappin machine
Red rag hangin low in the back of my jeans
I black out like February, back out what's necessary
Oh-seven Bugatti with Jimmy Iovine's secretary
I'm runnin the buildin, don't make me run in the buildin
No this ain't the first time I had my gun in the buildin
Walkin past offices I see my son in the buildin
Last album on the wall I'm number one in the buildin
They should build me an office up under the buildin
My elevator goin down, I am done in the buildin nigga


We in the motherfuckin buildin man
You ain't got your motherfuckin mind right?
You gon' get your mind blown out your motherfuckin mind right nigga
It is what the fuck it is man

Then you can see more bling
I ain't into the hype
But the story of my life is directed by hype
Half a mil' on the Lambo, had to roll the dice
If she married to the game, tell that bitch throw the rice
Slip and fall in pussy, that's just the life
Ten thousand a month on child support, that should suffice
Chump change to a nigga who got it
Jump lanes witcha boo in Bugattis
And your boo in Bugattis
I'm from a era where, you ain't have it
You cocked your pistol and ran up on a nigga who got it
You don't want to see 10 Impalas pull up on Broadway
Chrome to your chin like you doin' pull ups on Broadway
Hurricane, Meek, Puff, Game through the hallway
30 million dollar crib, mile long hallways
All the way up, no all the way down

""He signed with Dre, he gon' sell
Will he do a mill plus or will he end up in jail?""
Get real close to the speaker, I got a story to tell
He went from the front porch to the cover of double X-L
I took one in the heart, I'm ready to die
And all this hennesey will make a nigga crash the G5
Catch me at a stop sign nigga I ain't drunk
I'm gangsta I pop mine and leave you eyeing the pump
Tie your faggot ass up let you die in the trunk
I'm from Westside Compton nigga I ain't a punk
Streets is talkin', Is he from Cali? is he from Queens?
Do he ghost for P. Diddy, can he write me a sixteen?
Did he take 5 shots? is he a blood or a crip?
Ridin' through the CPT my hood painted on the bricks
And I'mma die with a empty clip, 'cause I'm a ghetto boy

Ate Doggystyle for breakfast, lunch was Reasonable Doubt
I ain't know how to count bars, I was writin' on napkins
High as fuck I wrote my first sixteen to Illmatic
I was in the hood fightin' with niggas, over who the best MC
Ice-Cube, Snoop Dogg or Xzibit (Pac, and Pac)
And how the East been makin' a killin'
Since them Long Beach niggas walked in New York and crushed the buildings
Then this Marcy Project nigga came and stole the crown
Right after the king of N.Y. had got shot down
Ten years later I'm in Harlem killin' them mixtapes
They like me, I want 'em to love me like they love Ma$e
But holla in L.A them niggas'll tell ya they hate me
And the plan is to catch me with my gun on safety
Nigga I'm still breathin', I ain't dead
Next time you try to kill me put one in my head

I don't give a fuck where you niggas from
East to West coast I'mma bang my gun

Before Jimmy Iovine the kid was in IVs
These bitch niggas tried to take my life for five Gs
I was in the projects, two o'clock in the mornin'
Playin' Madden, niggas kicked in the door and start blastin'
Nigga I'm a gangsta, I don't need no pity
I just sit inside the Ferarri and roll up a philly
And I been compared to Shyne like Shyne was compared to Biggie
I'm from Compton he from New York City
Come on really you gotta be kiddin'
Ain't nobody Biggie but Biggie
But I'm a six figi niggie, and I know Fifty
But that don't mean I can get you backstage at awards
Or cause you went to highschool I'mma take you on tour
'Cause he got two bodyguards he can't get hit with the four
And 'cause he wear a vest don't make him 2Pac Shakur
When you see me in the streets, ain't no security guards
No L.A.P.D, no bullet proof cars, I'm a gangsta!

But you're gone and it just isn't fair right now, right now (One time for our nig', we got the world lit)
On God, the work is never done (We love you, Nip)
The good they die young, used to be my son
Even when it waivers, the pain I feel is numb
Know that you were loved, yeah
I didn't wanna write this song

Didn't wanna write it, so it's from the heart
Even brought your homie from Leimert Park
Smokin' papers on Vernon for the hurt
Reminiscin', you and Blacc Sam built it from the dirt
Los Angeles, the gift and a curse
Focused on your neighborhood but you shifted the earth
You had the Staples Center packed like a church
Whole South Central put they hands on your hearse
I wonder if Heaven got a Slauson
You with Biggie and Pac, look at you, big as the bosses
Headed to a marathon, look at your nigga, he flossin'

On the days that I'm feelin' exhausted, think about uncle Snoop at the funeral talkin'
This type of shit you don't see that often
Stevie Wonder singin', he can't even see your coffin

I wonder if you're free right now, yeah
I wonder if you're happy, are you livin' out your dreams right now?
I hope the angels are givin' you your wings right now
The hardest thing that I had to sing right now
Right now, right now, oh, God
The best was yet to come (Sometime)
The good, they die young
Used to the be sun even when it rains, yeah
Pain I feel is numb
You'll always be loved
I didn't wanna write this song

Ayy, shit sound like it look
All the history you made, nigga, I could write a book
You had the Eight Treys walkin' with the 60s
I witnessed it all, you was right there with me
From Eritrea to South Central
From South Central to Brooklyn, look at what you been through
Mind over matter, yeah, it's all mental
But I still don't trust 12 when I see 'em in my rearview
Six years ago, I could of been you
Me and some of my old homies had the same issues
If I come, tell God to let me in
Give 'em the room next to Aaliyah with ESPN
You got tears fallin' down the cheeks of Mexicans
You got a number in my phone I can't text again
And if they killed you, they could kill Game
But I don't mind dyin' if it's gon' bring real change

Say hi to the sky, now it's your turn to fly
Still we cry (Still we cry)
I wish I could have protected you there
Just say hi to the sky, now it's your turn to fly

Niggas got swag, I got the Tek-9
Niggas got cash better run it
Only dubs and hundreds, I don’t do fifties, nigga
And I don’t do 50-year-old Jiggas
Off that boss black Lamborghini, interior soft crack
Louis V golf hat, feelin’ like a Tiger
I made something out of nothin’ like MacGyver
Started from an eighth, flipped it to a key
I got ‘em like ay, trappin’ like Gucci
Plus I get more green than bleu cheese
And I keep a red bandana in my blue jeans
So, nigga calm your nerves, with all that absurd
Far from the curb bullshit slash spoken word
You nerd I’m from the same city as Venus and Serena
So don’t get served I’m so wavy, I don't need no yacht
Ain’t no Big Pimpin' on my block
But I’m an underground king, peace to Pimp C, yeah
Catch me ridin’ through the hood, 20-10 Bentley
You got cheese and I kill rats
Translation: I still trap now do something with that
Or respond to this and with them big-ass lips
You got my name in your mouth I hope it tastes like this—Ahh
No homo, one more time—Ahh that’s your promo
And I been hard to the core since I went solo
Only man on my horse like my all-black Polo
And where I’m ’bout to go is usually a no-no
But I’m loco, got the camel in a chokehold
Tryna son me, I’m not from NYC
You can’t even have a child by your Destiny
And I ain’t mean to take a shot at B
I blacked out like you did Free
‘Cause I’m so wavy
Too hardcore to be a Jay-Z
Rock more red than Weezy Baby
Please say the Baby
Been around for years, so bitch, don’t Drake me
And this is not a diss
‘Cause I was just out in LA with Drake, bitch
And no disrespect to G and Hip-Hop
But nigga I’m a G and I’m doing this for hip-hop
And that’s ‘Ye’s brother, and ‘Ye my nigga so
I’mma give him some advice: Get rid of Amber Rose!
I’mma tell you how she get down
I was at Dig’s afterparty, sippin’ Cris
She was whisperin’ to Chris Brown
I seen Chris turn his head like “No!”
Then Gold Digger came on, I pointed like, “Hoe!”
But this ain’t ’bout her, this about Hov
I’mma chop down the Roc and take it to the stove
I apologize to B, ’cause this about Hov
I’ma chop down the Roc and take it to the stove
“D.O.A.?” No! T-Pain stays, old nigga goes
I’m so wavy too hardcore to be a Jay-Z
All up in your ear like Drake beats
So the nigga that cut ‘Ye couldn’t fade me
You took a shot and the shit grazed me
I wet up your block just like the Navy
Put a label on the shit and write “Play Me”
DJs go in, DJs go in
Cause I'm so..
Funk Flex, you my nigga. Clue, what up? DJ Enuff. I know y’all can’t play this shit. It’s too wavy. And Jay your boy, it’s all good though, y’all still my niggas. DJ Drama, Kay Slay, lock in.

The Kill,Purp & Patron,2011.0,"I'm goin' in for the kill
I'm doin' it for a thrill
Oh, I'm hopin' you'll understand
And not let go of my hand
I'm goin' in for the kill
I'm doin' it for a thrill
Oh, I'm hopin' you'll understand
And not let go of my hand

Let me crack this Patrón and talk to you for a minute
Won't you put that blunt down before you put the chronic in it
Before you do that drive-by, listen for a second
Why you need a .45 when your mind is a weapon?
If you use it like you 'posed to then you could be Malcolm X
Instead of countin' body bags, my nigga should be countin' checks
Don't be a follower, nigga, be a leader
And if that means I'll lose you on Twitter, then so be it
Had a daughter yesterday, see my baby momma bleedin'
Remind me of Keyshia gettin' shot down while she was feedin'
Her baby in the projects, I'm 'posed to be proud of Compton?
I'm just glad me, DeMar, and Brandon made it outta Compton
I put on for my city like Jeezy say
Iron out my red rag just for Free Weezy Day
And since they did Oscar Grant like Emmett Till
Crack the Patron seal

I'm goin' in for the kill
I'm doin' it for a thrill
Oh, I'm hopin' you'll understand
And not let go of my hand
I'm goin' in for the kill
I'm doin' it for a thrill
Oh, I'm hopin' you'll understand
And not let go of my hand

I can take you back to '03 when ain't nobody know me
My game was regional like the Lower Merion, Kobe
Teach me how to Dougie, come here, little man, show me
Clutchin' on his mama leg, remind me of the old me
Ain't trippin' off no old beefs, ain't grindin' on my old streets
I'm in the hills smokin' on cigars like a O.G
Cooley High, Cochise, Levi's, no fleece
Space Jam Jordan's killin' 'em without the cold sheets
Rappers say they trappers and these trappers think they rappers
Go listen to Blueprint, you're all hustlin' backwards
Shout out to my real niggas, Birdman, Styles P
Kiss my nigga Sigel, know them Philly niggas wild, B
Snoop, you insane cuz, Bun you a trill one
Nas, we forever since you helped me get a deal, son
And my nigga Fab, write his verses like a will
He walked out the booth, it's my turn

I'm goin' in for the kill
I'm doin' it for a thrill
Oh, I'm hopin' you'll understand
And not let go of my hand
I'm goin' in for the kill
I'm doin' it for a thrill
Oh, I'm hopin' you'll understand
And not let go of my hand

If I ain't never told you nothin', I think you might wanna listen
Leavin' Aftermath and G-Unit was never my decision
But I'm back now, when we recorded Back Down
Once friends, now foes, both our phones tapped now
50 was my nigga, but life is funny like that
Eminem played the bandage and Dre was the ice-pack
So I unwrapped the gauze, but my scars never healed
Sometimes stars align and some stars never will
Like Ross and Jeezy, both y'all my niggas, y'all should chill
Instead of beefin', lets remember how Baby Blue got killed
How Wolf got shot down, how Meech got locked up
When niggas start beefin', you should give them some Cîroc, Puff
And pour me a shot, my own brother want me dead
Worse than that, my nigga Young Buck got raided by the Feds
So Timbaland, Cool n Dre, Just Blaze, and Pharrell
Next track I get, nigga

I'm goin' in for the kill
I'm doin' it for a thrill
Oh, I'm hopin' you'll understand
And not let go of my hand
I'm goin' in for the kill
I'm doin' it for a thrill
Oh, I'm hopin' you'll understand
And not let go of my hand",https://genius.com/The-game-the-kill-lyrics

Death Row Chain,Streets of Compton,2016.0,"I was just a young nigga on the block
Just a young nigga on the block
Said I was just a young nigga on the block
Just another young nigga on the block
Suge signed Pac, it was on, cause I fuck with Dre
Straight Outta Compton was a product of N.W.A
But shit everything changed when Ice Cube went solo
Riding shotgun in my brother Fase Lolo
On my way to school, having shoot outs with the cholos
If it wasn't them, we getting jacked by the popo
In the tenth grade smoking weed on the low though
My momma ain't know though back of the class
With a Source magazine just flipping through the photos
Fuck with Reasonable Doubt but not when Pac was on the road though
In 1995 I started to bang
And I would do anything for one of them Death Row chains

A nigga would do anything for one of them Death Row chains
A nigga would do anything for one of them Death Row chains
A nigga would do anything for one of them Death Row chains

Even though he was born on the East, Pac was accepted here
Especially rocking that chain with that electric chair
I set back and watched him, threw up the West side
As Suge, Pac, Snoop and Dre hit the cover of the Vibe
'96, it was on
I took a Death Row sticker then slapped it on the chrome
Riding down Rosecrans with my hand on the toast
Stuck at a light, bumping ""2 of Amerikaz Most""
I used to spray it on a locker, a nigga run up
I yell, ""Death Row!"" and sock him and I kept a gun tucked
Selling weed with my nigga Sonic
All we used to listen to was Doggystyle, All Eyez on Me and The Chronic
Then a couple Long Beach niggas changed the game
Daz and Kurupt, nigga, fuck O-Dog and Caine
But when Dr. Dre left, shit wasn't the same
And I would've did anything for that nigga Death Row chain

A nigga would do anything for one of them Death Row chains
A nigga would do anything for one of them Death Row chains
A nigga would do anything for one of them Death Row chains

Dre started Aftermath and found Em
Eazy-E died from AIDS but why him?
Snoop signed to P, Suge signed Left Eye
Death Row fell apart, what happened to the West side?
I used to smoke and just sit in the truck
I was forced to bang Biggie and Puff
I was mad at niggas, felt Death Row ain't give us enough
And for that we ain't giving a fuck
The whole coast split it up, now Dre in New York working with Nas
And Pac stomping niggas out inside the mirage
I saw it on the news and I knew it was on
They say the look on Pac face, nigga knew he was wrong
Knew he was gone, stomp the nigga two minutes long
Know I'm repping West side, putting you in the song, damn
2Pac got smoked by Baby Lane
And both of them niggas dead over a fucking Death Row chain

A nigga would do anything for one of them Death Row chains
A nigga would do anything for one of them Death Row chains
A nigga would do anything for one of them Death Row chains",https://genius.com/The-game-death-row-chain-lyrics

And just to think, I made all this off one key

Two feet in Compton, one deep
Can't ride with me, 'less I'm Pimp C and you Bun B
My flag ain't got no stars on it, fuck my country
Get your toupée knocked off tryin' Donald Trump me
I'm the OG to the YG's
You ain't seen what I seen
My cousin Tasha shot in the stomach, pregnant at 19
She died, but the baby kept stompin'
That how hard us little niggas come up
Born and raised in Compton
We earned this shit, we learnt this shit
City used to be all white
Look how we turnt this shit
2Pac turning in his grave from all this nonsense
A little soldier ain't from Bompton
I put that on the homies

God said in the last days there would be times of difficulty. For people would become lovers of self, lovers of money, proud, too arrogant, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, heartless, unappeasable, slanderous without self-control. Lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God. This calls for wisdom. Let the one who has understanding calculate the number of the beast. fuck Donald Trump, homie

I father kids and I father niggas
I done been on Lil’ Yachty
Shot Crips with Lil’ Uzi
Got bricks from the Migos
And my bitch is bad and boujee
Every time I turn around
Somebody trying to sue me
And old friends turn colors, like Notorious B.I.G. Coogi
I promise this ain’t a movie, my nigga
This ain’t on Netflix
This is every time you in the club, we gonna set trip
Another dead body on the dance floor
That’s what them hood niggas do, when them bands low

How many people endure that judgment?
The steeple is meant to usher the presence of higher power
But the reverend desires showers with seven virgins
And hours of heaven, lustful pleasures
A couple C cups and the essence enough to keep blood rushin', I fuck with her heavy
I might jump in her belly
I might summon her friends just so we all function like Eddie
I treat it like an animal plus the camera's on steady
Do my damage and then go scramble leaf panties like levies
They gon' judge me no matter what I do, uh
So I keep my halo with a peace sign, give a fuck 'bout you
When I recline, I'ma need a fee, so I never get enough, I knew
I barely even touched my food, we skipped the appetizers
I slid inside her, when I'm done, I'm like, ""What the fuck I do?""
Now her head's on my sleeve and my hand's on her weave
She wanna stay and parlay and conversate over trees
But now I'm ready to leave
And I'm just wonderin' where my keys is at

They put a cross on Jesus' back
They made him crawl 'til his knees was black
They put a cross on Jesus' back
They made him crawl 'til his knees was black

One time 'bout to pull up
One time 'bout to pull up
Tell them niggas stop doin' pull-ups on the stop sign
Assembly line with this Glock 9
We don't toss that, tell her put in her purse
We live this real-life shit then put it in a verse
But this freak only askin' me, ""Do them bullets really hurt?""
Can't answer no questions unless you really from the turf
But I can put you on
See your curves from them curves that I swerved up on
Legs so smooth, the type of thighs you sniff a bird up on
Fuck to Summer Walker, no matter how many times we done heard that song
Daycare on your back, scoop them kids up with the shirt that's on
Back to the block where niggas stay active, no drama teachers
Pour O.E. out for our lost ones and stay elevated like Balenciaga sneakers
Inglewood to Compton, Space Jam's on, shot it out with monsters
13 to your back, Tristan Thompson
K.G., I'm like the chopper had a conscience
Every nigga gotta watch how he movin'
Every picture got a nigga next to Judas
Every nigga got his own cross to bear
And that's the reason that...

Trying make this money flip like it's a trampoline
I was hard headed, grandfather diabetic
I was trying do it big, like I was Faith Evans
Praying to the heavens, I can see my daughter smile
Know she watching now that daddy rip this record down
Know I love you baby, tell my god I said whatup'
And know I seen em' just meeting ends, so my family up
I should pray harder, instead I tote a pistol

Cuz' ain't nobody never rob me, I ain't never squeal
And ain't nobody never try, my niggas love to kill
Ridin' round wit' chuck, but it ain't a game though
My black wall niggas told me you a lame though
The Glock got a beam on it, like Kano
Banana clips and lemon squeeze's, just to split your mango

In front of club Liv
 stuntin' in that Masi coupe
Then we're gonna check Chyna see what King of Diamonds do
Pass the kush to A.R. when I recline the roof
That nigga get down for me like I'm 'bout to shoot
Tell em' its Money Gang my nigga Sonic real
And Kid Red be running trains like a monorail
Introduce you to my team niggas you need to know
We popping spades the bottles look like C3PO
Blowing that loud security telling us to keep it low
But when you pay me for a walk through
This is what you need to know
We smoking all night Kev got a handle for me
And tell the owner that 12 bottles is mandatory
And we gon' need a few Cirocs and them Gooses too
Same go for Greenhouse and Dreams down in Houston too
Watching Malaya eating shrimp while I throw these ones
Jas drunk as fuck' cause every time I look he show his gun
Every time we at the strip club he got the coldest one
Surrounded by killers 'cause J-Prince know his son
And I'm aight with that 'cause Rap-A-Lot my fam
And every time J ask me can I dot dot? Yeah I can
'Cause he been looking out for me before the Drake co-sign
And I was there when him and Tune heard that Drake was gon' sign
But look at Drake now every time that I need something
He do it and say ""Game holla if you need something""
And that's loyalty in an industry that's full of snakes
When niggas send a bottle to your table just to show they face
And bitches standing looking pretty just to get a glass of Ace
Most of these hoes dumb and ain't nothing but an ass and face
But if you are the ones thats lucky enough to stand up on this couch
Make sure as soon as we hop in that Phantom you got them titties out
I hate you fake hoes I swear I hate you fake hoes
Your fake ass, your fake nose, you never gon' be J-Lo
Nicki put you on that Mike Kors got you thinking
That you on the right course to fuck the nigga in that white Porsche
But I got news for you, got a wifey and three kids at home
And I can't even start to count how many times we've been to Rome
My oldest kid is 10 and some my youngest got his tennis on
And you ain't never seen a 4 year old swaggin in his Foams
Now they wanna be him 'cause he rocking colosseums
Used to rock it for the fiends now he rock with Europeans
All out in Dublin with them green bottles bubbling
Twins I call doublemint, they calling me by my government
I swear to god that I'm loving it
I'm on the beach with Miss Dominican Republic
Even she surprised that she sucking it
But don't be surprised that I'm fucking
Never cuffing, always puffin', these bitches know who they fucking with
I'm the fucking shit, handsome ass nigga
Fuck with me I'll fuck with her you gon' need ransom cash nigga
Now cancel that nigga like my BlackBerry service
Don't believe none of you niggas till them plaques start servicing
Niggas get nervous when we hop out them Suburbans
Get to tying red rags around our head like they turbans
After niggas murk 'em, I'm behind the Phantoms curtains
Headed to Greystone, my alibi is this Persian
Her alibi is this Asian, I call that a persuasion
From Hollywood lock up to yelling out bring the spades in
Dumb bitch right here wanna know why the bottle green
I'm something like them golf niggas, I done seen a lot of green
640 mil 'bout to play the lottery
A rich nigga can't win twice? Don't lie to me
'Cause I'm Donald Trumpin,' Feds trying to eye on me
Ain't no limit in spending this money I'm bout it bout it P
I'm who these new rappers trying to be
Every new nigga that say 'five' becomes a prodigy
And you should honor me, hang my jersey up? Sure!
We got a situation, nigga Jersey shore
Know I'm 'bout my occupation, know I'm 'bout fucking these hoes
Know I rock them Louboutins and smoke til its stuck on my clothes
And I got your girl in her comfortable clothes
I'm 'bout to tickle her with what's right up under my nose
Its money gang bitch, now watch my company blow
And go from a hot logo to something you know
I'm in the Maserati, Jordans punching the floor
And you can act like you don't nigga, but...

Either I'm going too fast or doing too much
Shut it down all the time when I'm in the club
Ooohhhh, ooohhhh
Yeah I'm always in the zone chilling with a bad bitch
And she got nothing on, yeah I'm gonna do it, shut it down
Yeah I'm going too fast, so fast....",https://genius.com/The-game-god-speed-lyrics
Never Be Friends,"You Know What It Is, Vol. 3",2005.0,"[Intro: Billboard & 
 Game
]
This is my nigga since we was kids like..  You know I'm sayin', we was like the uh.. You could say like a gangbang dynasty or something'. His older brother and my cousin ran together so that hooked us up together since we was kids you know I'm sayin'?
We both used to spit but like he took it more serious than me
You know what I'm sayin'? I was fuckin' up in and out of jail
But Game came back and got me like he said he would so you know what I'm sayin' it's Black Wall Street. Me and The Game
Never be friends, nah
Never be friends

Yeah
Though I walk through the valley of death
Vest on teflon now I approached in my Hurricane sweats
Black crow on my shoulder, Big Will 'till it's over
He never got to see me put black chrome on the rover
Readin' your obituary, wishin' we never met
So I wouldn't have to shed tears or wake up in cold sweats
Lookin' at this bottle of Hennessy wishin' you never left
Wishin' I chased your Monte Carlo down and gave you my vest
Or better yet, I wish they never let you out
And I never got that phone call tellin' me that you out
Wish you never signed the release form
I wouldn't have to clear this sample
Or use this track to say rest in peace for him
You wanted to know if Dre and Em felt you
They did, and before I could tell you somebody killed you
I feel pain for everybody that ever knew the real you
Call Nas let him know I got a Ill Will too

My nigga, If you look In the mirror, would you see things clearer
My nigga who I live, who I live for (Haha, my nigga)
And you know where you headed, do you know who you are
And why you do the things you do (My nigga)
My nigga, If you look In the mirror, would you see things clearer
My nigga who I live, who I live for (My nigga)
And you know where you headed, do you know who you are
And why you do the things you do (My nigga)

Niggas politicin' wanna know why I'm rhymin' different
My best friend got murdered nigga my mind is different
If you ain't never spend no time in prison
You can't understand these bars or the lines I'm spittin'
Niggas rilin' me up, let's go find the victim
I can't do it homie, that's the reason Shyne in prison
And through divine intervention 10 plus years doing crime in the trenches
Multiplied by the time that we spent in the kitchen
Is a life worth of hard livin Cuban cigar tippin'
12th grade ditchin', purple served by the jar sippin'
If you lost a homie, you know friendship is God given
I done seen the church so much, you'd think I was born Christian
I done seen more dead bodies than a mortitian
Seen niggas in and out of county blues like they was born crippin'
So I'mma keep on livin 'cause when I'm gone
Niggas ain't gon do shit but fuck my bitch and pour liqour

My nigga, If you look In the mirror, would you see things clearer
My nigga who I live, who I live for (Haha, my nigga)
And you know where you headed, do you know who you are
And why you do the things you do (My nigga)
My nigga, If you look In the mirror, would you see things clearer
My nigga who I live, who I live for (My nigga)
And you know where you headed, do you know who you are
And why you do the things you do (My nigga)

What If you was me and you had to sit through an entire funeral
While the pastor readin' your homeboy's eulogy
I'm already dead, what the fuck you gon' do to me
Keep talkin' shit I'll empty my clip in that G-Unit tee
Gimme a minute to say my grace with God
I see your face in the mirror I came a long way to talk and tell you
Your moms is missin' you, your pops is missin' you
Just saw your baby pictures in your grandmother's living room
Fase is missin' you
, homie Wink is missin' you
Thank God you left us memories and songs to listen to
Velle is missin' you, the 'hood is missin' you
Let my son graduate high school, and I'mma come visit you
The world is missin' you, Eminem was feelin' you
Dre said he felt your vibe the little time he spent with you
Pour the Henny out cause he ain't here in the physical
They say real men don't cry but nigga I'm missin' you

My nigga, If you look In the mirror, would you see things clearer
My nigga who I live, who I live for (Haha, my nigga)
And you know where you headed, do you know who you are
And why you do the things you do (My nigga)
My nigga, If you look In the mirror, would you see things clearer
My nigga who I live, who I live for (My nigga)
And you know where you headed, do you know who you are

The first day, the first day I got out of jail you know what I'm sayin'
Nigga phillin', you know what I'm sayin', everything still fresh to a nigga man, I'm doing videos with Cam'Ron and Dipset and Game
You know what I'm sayin', like fuckin' bitches in the studio
You know what I'm sayin' it was kinda crazy when I first came home but I adapted to it and now I love it
You know what I'm sayin'? I done been to fuckin' uh..
I'm straight out of Compton my nigga
I done been to uh New York, Harlem, all through that motherfucka'
Miami, Atlanta, Detroit. I'm fuckin' with Eminem, Dre, 50

Blood Thicker Than Water,Born 2 Rap,2019.0,"Ooh, no, no, no
Yeah, bloodstains dripping from my eyes
Pain got me lookin' to the sky
Ayy, Streetrunner, you know the history
Blood's thicker than water

The best rapper alive, ain't up for debate
'Cause every time you challenge the throne, niggas hate
Just like your neighborhood, niggas smile when they in your face
Conspire behind your back and then show up to your wake
That shit fake, whatever it takes, you gotta defeat those odds
And don't trust nobody on this Earth except your mama and God
Niggas show they true colors, you don't even ask why
'Cause niggas always watch you cook, they want a slice of your pie
Leave 'em surprised, keep your eye on the prize and aim for the sky
You was born by yourself and that's the way you gon' die
Get the fuck up off your ass and stop wastin' your time
Don't get discouraged by no mountain, that shit easy to climb
You gotta do it at your own pace just like I tell my son
I can't do this shit for you, bro, you gotta win your own race
Stop walkin' around this mansion with the long face
Look at everything your daddy accomplished when you low on faith
And remember, the real see through the fake
You gotta grind through this shit, you do whatever it takes
You gotta take care of who you love, give your mama continuous hugs
Stop havin' all these expectations from people who ain't your blood

Yeah, bloodstains drippin' from my eyes (My eyes)
Pain got me lookin' to the sky
Lord, why? Oh why, oh why?
Oh why, oh, why?
Oh why? Oh (Yeah)
Blood's thicker than water
Yeah, spend my whole life tryin' not to die (My whole life)
Only time that I feel alive
When I look in your eyes

I know life ain't easy, I know death is hard
I know pain, I been to funerals, seen families scarred
Look at my skin, all these tattoos, bullet wounds, and scars
Can't nobody tell me shit, I used to sleep in my car
I know that life ain't easy, I know death is hard
I know tears can sometimes drown a broken heart
I know it's hard to make it up when you was down from the start
I know I ain't goin' back, already came too far
Life ain't easy, it ain't supposed to be
Ain't none of you niggas gon' fuck over me
I walk with God and I'ma stay clutchin' these rosaries
You ain't gotta be on my side, I keep a Glock 9 close to me
Bulletproof Rolls the color of a coca leaf
AK-47 under my chauffeur seat
They killin' niggas in Compton, some of y'all hope it's me
That thought alone make niggas paranoid, so watch how you approachin' me

Yeah, bloodstains drippin' from my eyes (My eyes)
Pain got me lookin' to the sky

Oh why, oh, why?
Oh why? Oh (Yeah)

'Cause they'll lay you flat down
And they'll do it right now

Club-hop, car shows, picnics
Big cars, big jewels, big dicks
Rush doors, or gotta hop the fence
Clothing stores, gotta blow my rent
Gotta show my ass, then go repent
Gotta call in sick, and tell 'em where I went

Don't want no problems, y'all
Fuck around, I'll pull out the problem solved
And watch egos dissolve
Nine times out of ten, you hoes involved

You gotta problem nigga run up

Representing the city from which I came

It's too much gangsta shit goin' on in the fuckin' world
For niggas to be actin' like girls

12-gauge shotty to your body, a fuckin' criminal
A animal, West Coast beat cannibal

Not Blood or Crip, I'm a Anybody Killa
For realer, half Blood half motherfuckin' gorilla
Suicidal, my flow is a automatic rifle
My rag is a flag, I should hang it from the fuckin' Eiffel Tower

Goin' goin' back back to the bank
Rest in peace to my safe

I'll have to leave her if she did me like Coco
The devil talkin' to me, but I dont hear him
Act like I'm deaf like So-So
Fuck you, fuck him, fuck them
Fuck my ex and her cohorts
Hundred bottles in the club, for no reason
Niggas start trippin', boom bow dope fiend
Fendi on my shoes, Fendi on my belt

Black Wall Mafia, new millenium Genovese
Got a million dollars say LeBron don't win a ring (word?)

Keep it movin' homeboy, the mac's always actin
Spit in your face, go 'head lil' baby rappers
Can't fuck with us convicts, Stat-land

Slammers is extra chunky, yeah, me and my red monkeys
Silverback sales are few donkeys, all of us live comfy
Blow your head off like lunch meat

Come through your hood in a Chevy Malibu, on stocks
We had a meeting before we got here, so shit gon' pop
Heads gon' roll, Patron gon' spill
Fitted caps getting peeled like the chrome on the wheels

Tied in a knot, as I creep through the chronic smoke
They say it ain't good weed if you don't choke

Your life savings I spent that
Niggas spamming my Instagram, begging me for they bitch back
Sending threats to my DM, tryna hack my email
Niggas whispering to they self all huddled up like females
Yo bitch bout to get detailed (WOAH)

Keep all of that Jeremy Lin shit in pocket

Gettin mine plus interest, you niggas still ain't winning yet

Bout to switch it up for the summer
Thinkin bout that electric Hummer
Strapped up got extra armor
In case a hatin nigga wanna play
Everything I rap a hunned
You can check my resume

They dont make em this G no mo

Skate On,California Republic,2012.0,"Lupe and me, red Ferrari
2010 infinity

Where the Almighty know, well alrighty then
I'm all mighty ho call me mighty Joe Quinn
With Josephine Baker in the Benz
On them shiny toes, glass slipper niggas with your Cinderalla chins
I'm a shark in the water, you see my flippers and my fins
The pool is my palace, go and send them niggas in
Rockstar, lets take the Bentley for a swim
I run the world take your hood to the gym
Stretch it all out, get it all thin
Back on my fat shit get it all again
Rap on my back bitch, hip hop on my brim
You think you're high now
Well thy style's no higher than my eyebrows, this should be a sin
Cleanse, flow clear kinda like how air look
Or like a Cinderella pair look
Or like Cinderella barefoot
No matter how many ankles of crews
The moral of the story, you can't fill my shoes
Lu!

(Mass murderer!)
And in the last verse from Lupe, touché
Ferrari drop top, but it came with a toupee
Niggas say they got cars like us, but do they?
Rap Phantoms, pack tannoms and strippers from Atlanta
Ménage à trois let 'em fuck, I watch
Stay on my J-O, Rolie when I'm punching the clock
Up on the block, everything mine, I stay on my grind
Chasing dollar signs, bumping Nas, it's halftime
And I'm the G-A, money signs, easy nigga
Don't want shit for free but weezy nigga
Load the Glock up, cops pop up
You can go to Iraq, take all the straps, come back and couldn't stop us
Aston with the top kush, paint job rock dust
Hand what I got in the trunk and get us all locked up
So fuck niggas and I'm talking from behind the trigger
Now come get a nigga, cause I'm sick of niggas

Hatin' on me, you wastin' your time
Nigga wanna kill me? Then go and stand in that line
Kill that shit, I ain't tryna hear that shit
I know you hear that shit, so nigga
Skate on, skate on (with your bullshit)
Skate on, skate on (Lupe tell em nigga)
S-S-Skate on, skate on
Me and my niggas tryna stay on, skate on

Usually wake up early like them Philly niggas
In the weed spot rolling kush A-R go get a Philly nigga
First smoke a not, we swimming it hard rock
We push it out all spots 'till they get us up off blocks
Straight for the bout pots, then bag it in in Banglocks
Watch for the top cops cus we nourish our own crops
Smoke it like blood clops, inside of the drug spot
Will take em to Van Gundy, big man on the block
Don't worry bout my residentials or my credentials
My flow a cocktail through a Def Jam window
That's for Shekyan, I'm the rapper niggas fear
No need for Craig Mack to kick the flava in ya ear
Keep the Lambo in fifth gear, catch me on a sunny day
Paint drippin' like Lil Weezy in Baby tears
King of LA I think I made it clear
Ain't nobody outselling 5 except Eminem and Dre this year


Now I've been rappin' for 9 years, 4 months
45, 46, 47 seconds, I was Doctor Dre's weapon
Had the option to stay and kept swerving
Made some rookie mistakes but so did Kyrie Irving
If Fifty was Lebron on a bad night
Or Floyd Mayweather when Manny Pacquiao did his jab right
I fucked a bad bitch but that was last night
And I ain't gon' say no names but she be singing, and her ass tight
This year I'm gettin' my cash right, 30 years old
Let Drake or Soulja Boy live fast life
Who ever said The Game wack, change that 'fore the thing clap
Niggas fucked up rap, I bought the flame back
Couple albums later, still the same cat
And my P-O, only motherfucker thinkin' that I ain't strapped
Next time you doubt me, I'mma have my accountant down south me
You can do this rap shit without me

And that money go fast, I hope you paying your taxes
All the questions they asking, all the cameras thats flashing

If you ain't breaking the bank, so we go hard everyday
In the sacrificial lamb, it's just the part that you play
And you the first one in your fam' to have the heart to get paid
Had the smarts to switch lanes, had the guts to be brave

And never will it be the same, this shit is expensive
The price that we pay, that's why I

Head game sick, she bi and switch often
It's kush bitch, quit coughing
My six, got streets talking
Timbo' this shit scorching, got bloods and crips walking
It's Nip', so get up off him
We like Biggie and Jigga mane'
The Nickerson's is Marcy, Bed-Stuy and Slauson
My flow something like Nasir, I should put a pause here
Run and tell niggas the gods here

On the cover of The Source with my chain hangin'
That was '05, still Fuck Benzino
Ridin' through the city with them twin Benzitos
Steppin' on C-notes, rollin' red dice like casinos
Throwing 'tron shots like free-throws
Tell Judas I'm alive and well
Will I be crucified? Only time will tell, until then I'm thuggin'
Spend my money on whatever
Runnin' through this cheddar as long as my crew together
Pop Ace, pop tags, pop hammers
Thug Life, I put that on Pac's bandana
Los Angeles king, tell my niggas in the bing
I blacked out the car and minimized the bling
Updated the Ghost, went Nas on the wave cap
And made wifey ring rocky, A$AP, yeah
Uh huh, let's go

This right here reminds me of when
The playas had the dope so the girls brought their friends
And every single night we did it again
We had a good time, we had a good time
In the city

I was forced to be a force
Diamonds in my cross, the cost for me to floss
Got me exhausted
Exhaust that's on the Porsche, got me wide awake
Just make sure that my wallets caked while I wait
The coupe drop well
Got banana clips in the Big Apple, homie, fruit cocktail
Eh Game what it look like
I got the shorty and I'm playing with her chest in the corner
Look like a rook, right? Hahaha
The city that never sleeps
We ain't talking 'bout money, we prolly will never speak
Lobby within a week, we generated revenue
Old heads put me on the things that I never knew
I'm big in New York, word to my moms baby
And it's hard to be the Giant, just ask Tom Brady
That's why they pay me
When you ask who the best right now, that's why they say me
Fred and The Game, peace, T.B.M., peace

Remember 9-5 like our love felt right girl
Maybe it just wasn't the right time
Maybe in the next lifetime
(Game-Verse 1)
I'm sitting in my Ghost
 , I don't know what to do
What I know is I'm at my best when I fuck with you
I always thought we'd kinda just end up like the Huxtables
Thought our love was like Swizz and Alicia, untouchable
Thought we always had that Jay and Bey potential
And ever since we've been apart everything is an instrumental
And I can't even hear the words to my favorite song I'm so numb inside
Miss you telling me boy I'm ovulating so just cum inside
I'm kinda torn between what I want and What I know
That's why sometimes after the kids fall asleep I get up and go
Used to chase me down the hallway acting like you on Broadway
Hop in your Benz , tailing my Range trying to jump out where that broad stay
And that was crazy but at least I know you care
That was then this is now how the fuck we end up here
Now we care about our instagram posts more than each other
Post some subliminal shit like we ain't never met each other , thats crazy
(Chorus)
Oh I can only try so hard girl
Remember 9-5 like our love felt right girl
Maybe it just wasn't the right time
Maybe in the next lifetime
(Game- Verse 2 )
We spent the last 24 months arguing over these broads
That we forgot about the show and then Cali became the star
And maybe that was a blessing
Cause she could grow up to be Raven-Symone
In our discretion , I'd be right there for protection
These days my kids the only place to get affection
Could be wrong , you the school teacher maybe I just need correction
You Used to be the one to point a nigga in the right direction
Now we both inside Greystone sitting in different sections
Pretending we had no fun
All I really wanna do is get you to that SLS and fuck you til you see the sun
Maybe I wouldn't feel so bad every time I see my son
He ask am I coming home
And I tell him to go ask his mom
And Shit get real hard cause I can't live without my daughter
Why can't you just be Beyonce and try to ride for Sean Carter
You know I love my Kids and can't no nigga replace their father
This could be a love story , you the author , Write

Oh I can only try so hard girl

My Love For You,The Face of L.A.,2006,"My love for you...
Is like a angel flying through the sky
Like a bird in the winter and...
Your love for me...
Is so deep, and sorta like a black rose cracking the cement
My love for you...
Lives on like the memory of Aaliyah singing a last song
Your love for me...
I'll never die like a black child struggling the ghetto to survive

My heart goes out to the beautiful woman that raised me
20 years after the wats riot early 80's
Pops on drugs, moms couldn't take me in
Had a daughter already said she was to young to feed another baby
And shit got crazy, then 2 years came and went
Baby's just growin' away, we can't even pay the rent
No hot water, I reminisce tears running down my face as I hold my daughter
You spent years by the fire place, I was in the garden every Sunday at the church
Bible study at the cartends, I was hardhead
Back then I was selling crack
When your hard earned money paid for basketball practice
Always at the game on time, yellin' at the coaches
Wondering why your babyboy's sittin' on the pine
Even though life gets hard sometimes, I keep my head up
And I can make the sunshine in just one rhyme
Walk with me


In and outta lanes in that 57 Lincon continental, peddle to the floor
Lookin' for the highway to Heaven, remember when your babyboy was 7
We had good times like I was Jay Jay and you was Fleur the Evans
I should have listen to the Reverend, now I drain my pain in this 40 ounce
And these born ass records, disrespectin' your house
Livin' reckless, look at me, inside your jewelery box
About to pawn your necklace, every night you were in the window, lookin'
But what you do when your grandson's crooked, and he too old for whoopin'
Used to tell me I was smarter than that, took me down to the Compton, swapt me
Bought my first starter hat, pulled over raider jacket to match
A pair of Levis, a number 8 Jordan's with the all black straps
When you died my soul cracked, can I get a soul clap
I'm walking without a heart, can somebody hold that?


I got a lot of things I wanna ask the Lord
Like why I can't see my grandmother face no more
And why I can't seem to live without her
And if I pray could He send her back to me one day
Cause Heaven too crowded, everytime I think about it
I'm missin' your smile, can barely cope
My angel is gone, I'm heartbroke, drownin' in my own tears
Somebody throw me a rope or spread my wings so I can fly
I'm ready to die
Might cry but I'm still a man, might be a man but I still cry
Big mama, my angel in the sky
If you wanna feel my pain, then close your eyes, hold your breath
Now that's too close to death, open your eyes
See the light now and if you love your grandmother like I love mine
Go, tell her right now, I know how this might sound
But my plan is to show you that I understand, you are appreciated!",https://genius.com/The-game-my-love-for-you-lyrics

But I peep you niggas out my left window
So I blast and I blast 'til I blast no mo

To have a hundred thou cash brought down to tha precinct

And I got property, that's get out of jail money

Shoot-outs, gang-banging, and robberies
Car-jacking, snatching Mata's impalas

Hop out the ride and empty the 45 into his body

Ridin' down Compton Boulevard with a full clip
Ain't stoppin' at no red lights, niggas gettin' smoked, where I come from
And to the T Flats, it's fuck niggas, they be on one
But you gotta worry about your own
Niggas'll fuck your bitch behind your back and leave a knife in that motherfucker
Infiltrate your home, same niggas you let kick it
Can't see 'em but you hear 'em like a cricket
And just yesterday ya'll was smokin' til he asked for a handout
Since you the good nigga always passin' the bands out
Gave him a stack, shit ain't never enough
It's a cold world, who can you trust?

When your baby momma trippin' and your niggas on some bullshit
Gotta watch who you fuck with and who you fool with
Fuck around, get murdered by a nigga you was cool with
And set up by the same bitch you used to go to school with
Sometimes you gotta ride solo, (sometimes)
Sometimes you gotta ride solo
Loyalty ain't the same
You ain't alive if you never felt pain

One of my niggas stole some money from a nigga, he was trippin'
That's why you never bring your homeboys where you livin'
Chose the wrong path, thought a nigga wouldn't find out
Laid up in LA, using the bitch as a hideout
Couldn't tell em shit and every time I cried out
He left me in the middle of the street like a wideout
Told 'em don't go, but he ain't listen, now he gone
Spent the rest of the night chirpin' the nigga phone
Next mornin' came, see my brother outside
Tears runnin' down his face, knew my homeboy died
And I'd be lyin' if I say I didn't cry
It been 10 years, still askin' God ""why?""

You ain't alive if you never felt pain

Comin' home from the studio, nigga on your couch
Talkin' to your baby mama, fuck is that about
Raise a eyebrow, but you let the shit go
She a cold ass bitch, nigga, everybody know
But not at in the beginnin', she was fine as hell
So you went in her, fucked up, thought you had you a winner
And little did you know, she had niggas on the side
Tryna be a family man, had to let the shit ride
Whole damn time, bitch thinkin' she was slick
On top of you but mind on another nigga dick
Only think she ain't do was bring a nigga round your kids
Bitches ain't shit but that's just how it is

When your baby momma trippin' and your niggas on some bullshit
Gotta watch who you fuck with and who you fool with
Fuck around, get murdered by a nigga you was cool with

Our only, only choice is to stand in here with them and to say you're right, you can hope for a better life, you can do it differently
Miss Shakur did not go on a rampage about the people who shot her son

I'm feeling like a muthafuckin' boss bangin' 2Pac
High as a muthafuckin' Queensbridge rooftop
Blowing on this purple haze, feelin' invincible
Sellin' dope, never snitch, hood nigga principles
Abide by it, live by it, die by it, nigga
Even when I'm finga fuckin' hoes, finga on tha trigga
Diamonds in my crucifix, feelin' like a priest
Open the doors of my garage, see that '92 Caprice
Soldier for the cause, don't leave home without the strap
Know the map like the back of my hand, therefore I trap
See them cars and them street bikes, shining under street lights
Blowing on this peace pipe, welcome to the street life

Can't sleep through the night
Man, you better believe that I'm a street rider
Can't sleep through the night
I keep it tucked in my sleeves cause I'm a street rider (Uh-huh)
I'm a hustla, ghetto entrepreneur (Uh-huh)
And addicted to money, cars and hoes (Uh-huh)
Got my toolie tucked and ready to draw (Uh-huh)
With a middle finger up, screamin', 'fuck that law!' (Uh-huh)

The Phantom can't hold me, so I went and bought a Spider
Nigga, I Swizz Beatz like a fucking Ruff Ryder
Can-am engine, suicide rims
Niggas can't live wit' it: commit suicide then
Wish cancer on a hater, wish AIDs on a slut
Take the ride kill me 'cause ain't a bitch that I trust
I'm just rollin' up this kush, 'bout to crash my girl truck
Her friend texted me tryna to kick it like the world cup
She just tryna get some ace of spades, tryna hit the blunt
She a cunt, hit her once and call her ass next month
See these bitches tryna stunt and these niggas stay hatin'
See my watch a cold bitch, call that hoe Sarah Palin
All my albums went platinum, nigga, thanks to the block
Voice raspy as ever, nigga, thanks to them shots
Back reppin' Aftermath, nigga, thanks to the Doc
And these hoes in my Panamera thanks to Ciroc

Can't sleep through the night
To all of my gangstas, street rider
Can't sleep through the night
Goin' out to mu hustlas, street rider (Uh-huh)
I'm a hustla, ghetto entrepreneur (Uh-huh)
And addicted to money, cars and hoes (Uh-huh)
Got my toolie tucked and ready to draw (Uh-huh)
With a middle finger up, screamin', 'fuck that law!' (Uh-huh)

I switch from chillin'
Cause rappers harassin' me, illin'
They rich, infatuated by just casually livin'
The bitch could have a threesome with 'em, so now they pimpin'
Lil' monkey, that's how a king is 'pose to be
How you open, when she willin'
Let me take you to '87
14 years old, I was a ladies legend
38, a bird in the safe, '98 Oldsmobile
I ain't frontin', I don't know Pharrell
He wear pastel colors
I wear the pain of the Soledad brothers
And them chrome gat busters
An R&B wife on the arm, I close shop
I showed niggas they first Bentley, fuck I window shop
Show niggas they first ice, now they like, 'I love you'
Remember when they hustle, was tryna sue Russell
For what other nigga did to him, sounds sickenin'
That's why I cut him off, word to God, he was snitchin' then

Can't sleep through the night
Goin' out to my gangstas, street rider (Out to my gangstas, yeah)
Can't sleep through the night
Goin' out to my hustlas, street rider (Goin' out to my hustlas, uh-huh)
I'm a hustla, ghetto entrepreneur (Uh-huh)
And addicted to money, cars and hoes (Uh-huh)
Got my toolie tucked and ready to draw (Uh-huh)
With a middle finger up, screamin', 'fuck that law!' (Uh-huh)

When I can't sleep through the night
Keep my eyes wide open, street rider (My eyes wide open, yeah)
Can't sleep through the night
When have you known me for jokin'? (When have you known me for jokin'?)
Street rider (uh-huh)
I'm a hustla, ghetto entrepreneur (Uh-huh)
And addicted to money, cars and hoes (Uh-huh)
Got my toolie tucked and ready to draw (Uh-huh)
With a middle finger up, screamin', 'fuck that law!' (Uh-huh)",https://genius.com/The-game-street-riders-lyrics
Rest In Purple,UnKnown,2016.0,"Why everybody got to to die so damn soon?
All these legends dyin', God got to be runnin' out of room
How he die? Don't nobody even know yet
All I know is I ain't ready to go yet
So I jump in that purple Lambo
Throw in that Bryson Tiller, ""Rambo""
After that its ""Purple Rain,"" its ""Purple Rain""
Man its Purple Rain on repeat
First Michael Jackson, then Whitney Houston
Now Prince, its a 3 peat
And if you see me in traffic its three beeps
And you know what's crazy? He was 57 with no kids
So I'mma hug mine ‘cause a nigga probably only got 21 more years to live
21 more years to breathe
21 more years to feel the sun rays
To fill collection pots up on Sundays
And 21 more years to wake my kids up on Monday
We all die one day
Everybody gotta go someday
Natural causes or the gun play
Since we was born we all been had it one way
Ain't no time to be askin' God why
And ain't no tears man I'ma let the doves cry

Everything is purple, I see purple in the sky
I got purple in my cup and I smoke purple to get high
I say live the way you want you never know when you gon' die
Maybe, maybe I'm just like
Everything is purple, I see purple in the sky
I got purple in my cup and I smoke purple to get high
I say live the way you want you never know when you gon' die
Maybe, maybe I'm just like
Maybe I'm just like
Maybe I'm just like
I see purple in the sky

Feelin' purple, might pour some lean today
When God take a star, he make a star, yeah go on, dream today
In the red Corvette gettin' cream with the top down
Diamonds and pearls all around your neck and that rain purple when it drop down
Yeah darling Nikki, I think its our time
I want to be your lover, then we gon' party like it's 1999
Get used to the pop life, we gon' live it
Celebrate it like Pac's life, yeah who else wit' it?
I remember watching 
Purple Rain
 when I was 5
My mom and dad fought the same way as yours, I ain't understand why
Ain't nobody perfect, ain't none of us the same
We all wanna leave the past behind us, sometimes we change our names
Well we can't change who we are, can't take the pain away
So live your life and love your family, don't take the world in vain
I'ma light one in your memory, ‘cause the time has come
The world lost a legend, but he up there with his son
So I'ma pour up in your memory, ‘cause the time has come
The world lost a legend, but he up there with his son

Up there with his son
‘Cause you're up there with your son

Everything is purple, I see purple in the sky
I got purple in my cup and I smoke purple to get high
I say live the way you want you never know when you gon' die
Maybe, maybe I'm just like
Everything is purple, I see purple in the sky
I got purple in my cup and I smoke purple to get high
I say live the way you want you never know when you gon' die

I see purple in the sky

Purple in the sky
Makes me wanna, cry
Purple rain in your eyes
I see you up there, shine
You shine
With the sun you shine

Soon as Dre say what Dre say, we on a yacht
Mediterranean Sea bangin' Dre Day, nigga
Gold chain like it's my payday, nigga
Two days away from land, yeah, mayday, nigga
Come on (Come on)
Dolphins hoppin' out the water like a '64 Impala, come on
You in the club tossin' dollars for bitches that suck and swallow
I rub the wood on a model like openin' night at Apollo
I give her the Cactus Jack, she gon' feel like she in Astroworld tomorrow
T-shirts gettin' borrowed, sunsets in Monte Carlo

Can you fill that glass for me?
Half Henny, half lemonade
Goin' up to renegade 'cause it's still 
Aftermath with me
Is it blasphemy if I take shots of holy water and ask the nun 
will she blast for me?
If I baptize a stripper, if she want me to tip her 
shake them titties and that ass for me
I told her I can't stay but here's where I stay
When you get there just ask for me

I got verses from Nas, beats from Swizz
Hooks from Blige, all that shit feedin' my kids
Took three to my side, two in my ribs
Bullet stuck in my leg, still, nigga, I'm here
I got samples from Blaze, killed shit from Premier
If niggas call my shit classic, it is what it is
Poured lean with Wayne, ain't sipped it in years
After what happened to triple X, my vision is clear
I be like Cyclops, see niggas from five blocks
Ask your man, my superpower these five Glocks
Yachts with stash spots, my niggas is black ops
We fuckin' these white hoes and flickin' off black cops
I know I'm an asshole, I grew up a have-not
Now we dockin' in Cayman islands and then make a cash drop
Ferrari in backwoods, chronic the mascot
So high I forgot this bitch name

Ayy
Can you fill that glass for me?
Half Henny, half lemonade
Goin' up to renegade 'cause it's still 
Aftermath with me
Is it blasphemy if I take shots of holy water and ask the nun

Rewind II,Born 2 Rap,2019.0,"The bullet comes out of his head back in the Draco
I moonwalk back to the car, gun on my waist
Take the ski mask off of my face, blunt flies back in the trunk
Between my index and my middle finger, it's stuck
Inhale the smoke, take a puff
Drivin' in reverse, proceed to light it up
'Matic still Nas to listenin'
It's me and the opp, gets further in distance, hand on my watch
Movin' backwards, the Chronic jumps out the back wood
As the leaf waits for the guts and rolls itself back up
Text from a bitch sayin', ""Eat to going still""
Put my phone back in my pocket, took my knee off the wheel
Hand on my wheel, my car in drive, foot on the gas
Up the freeway ramp, adjust the rearview and look at my past
Speed goin' back up on the dash as I listen to Hill, Lauryn, and uncrumble all of this hash
Back in the carpool, flippin' off 12
The window rolls down and in comes pistachio shells
Cutie smilin' at me, I unthrew up the deuce
Triple one-two, three-one-three, three-one-two
On the side of a purple Maserati, wonder if she got a body up
Or should I think I? It's a hottie
Goin' down on the up ramp, creep slow, back to the light
I'ma kill 'em 'fore the end of the night
Talkin' on my burner cell like, ""At he where?""
Back into a parkin' spot, handicap in the mirror
Car door opens, my nigga out yells, ""Woo-Su""
Windows roll up, I'm thinkin' to myself, ""Who these niggas in this coupe?""
Back in the store, woods back in my hand
Sit 'em on the counter as he hands me back my Benz
And says, ""Nigga my, you thank,"" I pass him a coke can
10,000 goes back in my pocket in rubber bands
Back to the whip in rewind, back to the spot
Walkin' up the stairs backwards, the clip comes outta the Glock
The key goes back in the lock
I walk in facin' out, take my shoes off and fall on the couch
This bitch takes my dick out of her mouth
Stands back up and tells me what her day was about
We hug as her clothes fly up to her hands, lip singin' B Cardi while she dance
Tapes Bundy Ted, credits roll down, chill and Netflix
As I unfasten the latch on my cuban link necklace
She gave me a second hug for the first time
Walks outta the door back in the Uber as I'm cleanin' my .9
I sit it down right next to my phone
Go back to sleep and undream about Rihanna runnin' 'round in a thong
Woke up tired and went back to the booth
Sample God's Sons, rewind it and wrote it backwards to a loop

Listen up gangsters and honeys with your hair done
Pull up a chair, hon', and put it in the air, son
Dawg, whatever they call you, God, just listen
I spit a story backwards, it starts at the endin'",https://genius.com/The-game-rewind-ii-lyrics

Fuck this old nigga whistling for, outside my door?
Apartment 5B, where I learn to cook my first ounce of raw
Use to whistle while I work, she whistle while she twerk
Bitch bounce that ass while you roll that blunt, it can't hurt
While you wet and come up out that skirt, bend over, make it squirt
You can be my Superhead, maybe we should try that first
Let me whistle while you jerk, run my hand up ya shirt
If you with it, say you with it, let me hear my birdies chirp (we like it!)
""Estupido, porque tu miras a mis amigas asi?
Puto maricon, tu vas a ver Game, tu vas a ver""
Back shots make a bitch go berserk

(A Million) Motherfukka's wanna see me in the fed's
(A Million) Bitches wanna give me head
(A Million) Dollars in my bank account
(A Million) 
Soundscan the first week out
(A Million) Motherfukka's on my dick
(A Million) Motherfukka's talking shyt

Hit a break down...
I'm the king, and you better respect it
All I need is Beyonce, and a Roc-a-fella necklace
Nigga you can ""check up on it"", I'm a Slim Thug
Cincinnati fitted, wit the red and black brim blood
Gave nigga's 300 bars, two mixtapes, and a DVD
I did it for the C.P.T
Did it for New York, did it for Chi-town
Ran through hip-hop, and made these nigga's lie down
I'm going away for awhile, call it a California vacation
I call it a Bentley with a smile
GOD bless the child, wit incredible style
Nigga sicker than West Nile
, who king of the West now
I'm putting my vest down, nigga's ain't going to kill shit
Shut the fuck up, nigga you ain't going to kill shit
Rappers don't kill rappers, guns kill rappers
And I be wit real crips, real bloods, real clappers
Fuck rappin, these nigga's will push ya grill backwards
Faster than Iraqis when Bush attacking
My flow semi-automatic, blhow
Touching pussies is my job, you a bitch, this is sexual harrassment
Nigga get a lawyer, when 'The Game' coming for ya
My jab, like Zab on the chin of De La Hoya
I'm the golden boy, and I'm making Hova noise
Got the whole world clapping, just like the Nolia Boys
Since a juvenile, I had to prove my style
Went from Kayslay to DJ Clue, and blhow
20 Magazine covers, nigga look at me now
You need a hot 16?.. I need 100 thou
Cause half of these rap nigga's just be running they mouth
The other half, in the ATL runnin' the south
10 Mill in the bank, 7 bedroom house
I'm rich, so on my 30th birthday I'm out
Nigga, I'm so ahead of time, and I spit better lines
Better rhymes every-time, nigga's hate on me so much, I feel like I'm Kevin Federline
Fuck it im rich, for nothing, tell the media to get off of my dick
You wit me, my next album going to sell like Britney
I beat on these rap nigga's like Bobby do Whitney
No more drama, no more beef wit 50
And if you just tuning in, welcome to the 360 (welcome to the 360, welcome to the 360)
Right back where I started, in Compton, taking out the garbage
Where Crips and Bloods shoot it out like Pearl Harbor
That was '95, when Cube was in his prime
You brought yo Lethal Injection, and I brought mine
Rewind to '89, got my first mixtape
My brother brought it for me, they use to call him Big Fase
But now, we ain't brothers, nigga we ain't shit
And you living in my shadow like Marcus Vick
And I heard about yo lil rappers talking shit
Stay out my family business, or you get a coffin quick
I ain't change, same nigga that got off them bricks
Got signed to Dr.Dre cause his bars is sick
Getting head on the road, cause his cars is sick
And he whop so good, I had to pause this shit
I told 'em bomp, slow down baby
Got to get this shit firm like Foxy, NaS and AZ
She said 'fuck you,pay me
So I left her in AZ
That's what I get for letting her listen to my Jay-Z
Fuck a bitch, give me a 40, I'll take that
Dress up for the grammy's, but I still don't drive Maybachs
Nigga I'm gangster, and homey don't play dat
Stand way back, or get ya ass clapped ASAP
Nigga this the payback, you want beef.. say that
I'll have a hundred hurricane hoodies where you lay at
Get yo whole clique wet, making up crip sets
Nigga got ran outta New York by Dipset
Then he got ran out of Compton by my set
Banned from Watts, can't even walk through his projects
Nigga so lame, talking he gang-bang
Won't bust a shot, and the nigga know where I hang
I'm Big Daddy Kane, and the platinum chain
The fact remains, the game don't rap for fame
Game rap for fun, Game blast his gun
The game gotta rap in tongue, so that bastards done
Be easy, I might give you a pass this once
I'm ready to die, but I don't want a bastard son
Nigga, I rap too good, and I'm back in the hood
On the same couch, I put my demo in a package for Suge
After one meeting, I was right back in the hood
Red bandana hanging, selling crack in the hood
Now it's, Aftermath for good...
Any nigga mention Dre, get a Desert Eagle shoved in his fucking face
How that taste?
Blow yo shit out fa'real, Nigga im for real
Call Nelly or Paul Wall, tell 'em make you a grill
I cook beef, like a steak on a grill
Got the clips on hold, but I ain't Pharrell
Nigga I'm fa'real.. my flow ill, like smoke in ya lungs
I Spit sharp like a razorblade under my tongue
Nigga, I'm number one, motherfucka bar none
Who else kick knowledge outside of Hova and the God Son
We can go bar for bar, cocksucker drop some
Watch me take flight like Tom Cruise in The Top Gun
You might win some, but you just lost one
I beat on these lil nigga's like Dr. Dre drums
Look at these motherfucka's trying to prove theyselves
Thinking beefing wit hurricane going to boost they sales
Never that, motherfucka, I'm a clever cat
Kanye West in slacks, nigga, I'm as fresh as that
Ask Dre, ask Snoop, I'm nice
I'm Cube, I'm Jacob, I put rappers on ""Ice""

A skee , let me ask you a question
If you take the 120 bars, put it with the 240 bars
Then add the 360 bars, wit one Kevin Federline, what you get?

The Panamera shittin' on the 9-11
I call my homies, not 9-11
I'm the nigga with the juice
But I'll never do my nigga like Pac did Q

Bitch, who do you love?

I got a shorty name Texas and
She got a buddy name young JB and now you know the deal
We turnt up in the studio late night
That's why the songs that you hear are comin' real tight
OVO crew, nigga, thought I told you
If you a player in the game, this should hold you
And man shout my nigga Game he just rolled through
Eatin' crab out in Malibu at Nobu
A lot of fools puttin' salt in the game
Until these women get the notion that they runnin' the game
They got money that they jumpin' on the pole to make
Did the model, took a flight to the golden state
I'm the general, just makin' sure my soldiers straight
Had to leave my nigga, homie got an open case
But I'm big on the west like I'm big in the south
So we gon' pay some people off, we gon' figure it out
And my name too big, and my gang too big
Young money shit, me and Lil Wayne too big
Imma crush that ass even if it ain't too big
I would pinky swear but my pinky ring too big
Wassup


Blood Money, Cash Money and that's all
I'm the nigga with the crown on his head
Cross me and my city, I put the town on your head
Put that click-clack sound on your head
Me and YG Tha Dogg Pound wearing red
Me and my nigga Drizzy running through Miami like LeBron
Shout to Nicki, shout to Tune, shout to Ricky
Rack to the town roll a pound, shout out to Nipsey
1000 dollar blunts, blow it down if you with me
Get lost in the cloud, shout to Pac, shout to Whitney
Rollin’ down Wilshire in the Wraith, shout to Biggie
Got my 2 Chainz on Feelin’ like Tity
Ciroc in my glass, no Diddy, just affili
No pity and the bitches give me kitty like ""Meow""
35 million, how to make it? come and see how
Ballin' in the club, money tall as Boris Diaw
Me and YG out, now tell me!",https://genius.com/The-game-who-do-you-love-freestyle-lyrics

Inside the great California Republic

And before we do that, we still got a couple treats for y'all
We need to bring it back to the West Coast

Uncle Snoop, what up?
Anyways, 'til we meet again
See y'all on Skee TV

My bills are paid
And everything's okay
It's like every day
Summertime in L.A

Yeah, I'm from Compton, home of the fiends
Home of the monsters, home of triple beams
Home of the shattered fuckin' dreams
Where most niggas I grew up with ain't make it to see they teens
Ain't no Freddy, ain't no Jason, but niggas too scared to dream
And they rippin' pages out of them books 'bout Dr. King
You don't wanna know half the shit I seen
Where readin' a magazine get you hit with a magazine
Niggas ain't scared to murder 'cause the jails too packed
Kill a nigga, he be out before the R.I.P. tat
I seen Raider snapbacks by Starter
Then I seen Dre make that Sox hat harder
Then I seen Makaveli go at Shawn Carter
Then I seen that block where B.I.G. got slaughtered
Then I knew it was my callin'
G the fuck up or die ballin'
Lace them red Chucks up, but die fallin'

My bills are paid
And everything's okay
It's like every day
Summertime in L.A

Yuh, let's go
I'm risin' in this game and it feels great
Still tryna keep it real, niggas still fake
I'm so impatient, but I still wait
Dropped The Marathon in November, niggas still late
Still show love when I feel hate
On a scale of one to ten, need a high heel eight
Or better, blowin' this cheddar like I'm Bill Gates
Whatever, I'm in to win 'til this movie ends
Smokin' California, eatin' Peruvian
Out on Miami Beach, my niggas, a few of them
Dressed like Beverly Hills, the benches we usually wear
From wishin' on a star, nigga took it far
And if I lost it all to war, I wouldn't trip at all
Look, It sound crazy when I say it
But the fear of fallin' off is the only thing that could take it
I'm straight

And everything's okay
It's like every day

I got my hoodie on, it's a Starter
I'ma rock this motherfucker for Trayvon Martin
I'ma rock this motherfucker for Trayvon's daughter
That he coulda had, where's his killer at? The whole hood is mad
That ain't the first time, won't be the last
See reflections of my past while I guzzle through this glass
Make me want to run up on you with the muzzle, ""Where the cash?""
Retaliation is none, niggas can't afford the gas
Got a mansion in the Hills, Rottweilers by the gates
Red Ghost's in the driveway and ducks by the lake
Spendin' time with my daughter so them ducks gotta wait
Let a nigga call her a duck, he gon' eat a thirty-eight
I'm supposed to be this fuckin' rich
I'm supposed to be this fuckin' great

Muthafucka, what's up?

Naw, this ain't no fucking Dre beat, I got this from Irv Gotti
Game back on the shit I'm enemies with e'rybody
Game cook crack, transform to yayo
The new Suge Knight, nigga, minus the K.O
I keep it candy like Mariah, I'm so fire
When step it in the club, get low like Flo Rida
Cus I'm a pimp, you can tell by the limp
When I st-st-st-step aside the 26 inch
You see my rims? They bigger than Bow Wow
Get money, fuck bitches, that's what I'm about now
The Phantom, ugly, the Bentley, retarded
The kicks still Chuck Taylors
, the jacket is a Starter
I beg your pardon, nigga, we can get it started
If you ain't Nas or that nigga on third Carter
My happy face is Kenneth Supreme mug shot
When it go down, who goin' stop the blood clot?

Throw yo hands up it's that gangsta shit
All the homies go brazy when they bump my shit
Go ahead and hate on my click
Got a couple words for you nigga, suck my dick
You strapped? (That's right)
Gang bangin? (for life)
A little drama (that's life)
Hit 'em up (Nice)

All the homies go  brazy when they bump my shit

Nigga I'm a throw back, you already know that
Got swag and I'm street, picture the nigga Hov' strapped
And it's the rock right in my fuckin sock
Die for my chain, why?
So I can go fuck with Pac
Before I go, I shoot it out with the cops
Hit one for Sean Bell then bleed on the block, yeah
Like Big did, I play with toys like a big kid
Got a snub nose, call it Big Tig
You art not fuck with Game, he crazy
And the bars comin' straight outta Compton, baby
My 16's mean, you know what I mean
Headed to the airport, my flow flying in from Queens
Accompanied by my bitch, flying in with them things
My shorty is a 10, that's that singing nigga, Dream
The life of gangsta in Cali is too short
So I might as well find me a borough in New York

Throw yo hands up it's that gangsta shit
All the homies go brazy when they bump my shit
Go ahead and hate on my click
Got a couple words for you nigga, suck my dick
You strapped? (That's right)

Hit 'em up (Nice)
It's that gangsta shit
All the homies go brazy when they bump my shit

Man you know, I don't give a fuck and I don't give a shit
Any drama, I'm locked on like a red-nose pit
Keep shooting them cap guns with the red nose tips
Have some Cali niggas come out and dead those strips
Give a fuck if you tough nigga, or you buff nigga
My 4-5 weigh 3 pounds and it'll snuff niggas
Hop out the truck with the gun so long
Let the bullets jump out and ask, ""What's going on?""
What the fuck can I say? I grew up a bastard
Got sick of the Impala so I threw up a Aston
I pop big shit, and I keep my wrist lit
My entourage shine like the Diamond District
I got a Rolex, a real big Rolex
With so many rocks, the Africans is trying to protest
Bully of the block, why? Cus they got me top 5
There's four niggas better than me? Nigga, stop lyin!

Throw yo hands up it's that gangsta shit

Go ahead and hate on my click

Ten bands in every pocket got me feelin' overweight
My ex bitch came back around like a rollerskate
I told her ass, ""If you can't roll a blunt, you can't roll the Wraith""

Right now (Right now), let your hair hang down in the summertime
And the gangstas make the girls go wild
Baby, know we up (Up, ooh)
And nothin' but a G thang (G thang, oh-whoa)
Always strapped up, no problem, oh (No problem)
Put your cup in the air
It's a gangsta party, blow it in the air, baby (Ooh)
I want all the smoke, woo (Smoke, ooh)
Bring it over here, baby (Ooh)
Got you on call, bang on this, babe (Oh, bang it, baby)

I Just Wanna Be,Blood Moon: Year of the Wolf,2014.0,"So, close
But so, far away

I just wanna be a dreamer
I just wanna be a king
I just wanna get lost
I just wanna be me, I just wanna be free
I just wanna be
I just wanna be
I just wanna be

Put on my Dre Beats when I don't wanna hear the world talkin'
The walls closin' in, the studio feel like a coffin
But I resurrect myself every time like I'm Jesus
Rather walk on water, in the streets niggas dying for Yeezy's
Niggas sleepin' outside for them J's
Know how it feel to be homeless
 even if its just for a day
Some of us bow our heads down when we pray
Some of us bow our heads down so you can miss us with a stray
I grew up with DeSean let that young nigga play
Turn to run a slant let the bullet fly Zimmerman's way
I did it Eminem's way, when I was sitting with Dre
It was Aftermath or die then, Busta told me ride in
Snoop told me if you a dragon go spit that fire then
Game of thrones, I made my home inside that lion's den
And all my enemies I don't know where to find them
But me I got like nine in

I just wanna be a dreamer
I just wanna be a king
I just wanna get lost
I just wanna be me, I just wanna be free
I just wanna be
I just wanna be
I just wanna be

The son of Maya Angelou and Martin Luther
But my daddy was a crackhead, my mom was a booster
Born in the belly of Medusa with the killers and the three time losers
These cops pursue us, thug gangs recruit us
To carry on some torch, they were taught, would improve us
As the system maneuvers, they just feed us manure
They livin' in paradise, we shoot it out in the sewer
I call myself Stat to remind myself not to be a statistic
As the kush get twisted my consciousness get lifted
We party with devils, diggin' graves with dull shovels
Diamonds on my bezel, my grind on some other level
I'm subtle but won't settle, all black clothes
They say Stat you too ghetto, 
my pen wrapped in turbans
My bombs, bass and treble
, fell asleep in hell
I woke up livin' my dreams, I'm a rebel

I just wanna be a dreamer
I just wanna be a king
I just wanna get lost
I just wanna be me, I just wanna be free
I just wanna be
I just wanna be
I just wanna be

I just wanna be a dreamer, I see all these things with my eyes closed
Woke up to reality, actually in fly clothes
Life is such a gamble, I'm proof that the odds roll
So anythin' we plannin' we do it colossal
Hurt people that I know was dreamers, which means that just makes my grind that meaner
Let me turn my rhymes into a time machine and remind the people
How dope these lines can be when you're tryna reach the higher league
You seem to bleed through the soul to the choir speakers
I am preachin' to the youngin nigga I used to be
And usually it's just inspiration that you could use to be
Bigger than the world in a world where you are used for free
But still you live off of so much more than what you used to see
But who the fuck am I kiddin'? This shit is even new to me (Word)
I got with Game, I got in the game, and I could chew a piece
Of this fresh cooked filet, I could eat it every day
But I swear this the beginnin', I be dreamin' every day

I just wanna be a dreamer
I just wanna be a king
I just wanna get lost
I just wanna be me, I just wanna be free
I just wanna be
I just wanna be

My moms ain't scream or nothing
And I ain't never cried nigga

Motherfucker I'm from Compton, the hub city
I brought some thugs with me
That'll set up shop and get rid of drugs quickly
Drive Cutlass Supremes, on gold D's, puff sticky
Love 2Pac to death and still bump Biggie
Welcome to the west side
Where them Tec's fly
Dope boys drive them S5's
Come smoke and get the best high
Who the fuck said the west died
You dead, this the left side
I will Heckler & Koch, pop shots, for my 
Deal niggas, then smoking aces fucking with my 
Leave them with poker faces

07 Charger, K&M Filter
High speed burning it up for my 
My life real like it was directed by Hype Williams
I started off with visions of stacking Benjamins to the ceiling
The more gang banging, the more killing
The more drug dealing
The more cap peeling
We all 

Ay, From Frisco
Never rode a 6-4
They might ghost ride, ghost ride
But Ya Boy is low pro
Stay on the low though
Black Tims, Lacross polo
Black peekhole
Long nose 4-4
Ya never got your hands dirty
I'm outside with the grams early
Puffing life by the gram heard me
High as a bird
Grinding the curb
And if I get caught put me in a cell with my 
On the block, busting shots with my Cali Niggas
Fucking with them boys up in Watts, we all 
We run deep, hit Compton and rally niggas
Hurricane Game, line them up, let me tally niggas
Trouble makers
Call them big guns, rumble makers
Let the thunderquake 'em introduce them to the undertaker
Palm trees
Big sun with the calm breeze
You can call me one of the re, realest 

Yes, Southern Cali
Home of the Chuck Taylors, not Bally's
Far from Vegas, but Sin City
Ab-Soul, put me on it, chronic in the air
Catch the vapors
House parties, hungover through morning, see thats a 
You see I'm from the murderous blocks
Compton, California where you'd rather get caught with your gun on you
See it's as hot as a sauna
And in the winter time, niggas don't walk out without kissing they momma
Life of a 
Hip-hop trying to take the life of us 
Don't call them rappers, address them as Bill O'Reilly niggas
But we gon get them and we kill em, address them as some Hally niggas
Never the more they say they ain't feeling these 
When ya'll was ditching class over these hoes man
I was at Centennial catching fades over dice games
That's one years ago, 350 days
350 ways, I switch the flow, a hot 
I am a good dude to work with
Destroy your life or destroy these rap verses
Life's a bitch
So I buy whatever she wants, and hope heaven can be my reimbursement
Milk the game until I see her on the couch roaming this earth surface
At first I was parched, but now I'm the thirstiest
Dehydrated
Hungry, frustrated
One of the greatest 

Hey, Hey
Hey, Hey
I'm on the Wall Street like a stock broker
Then I'm back to the hood where they pop toasters
Every nigga screaming war, they is not soldiers
Selling crack in the hood with my

This on my chain ain't a label it's a movement
Fuck with caps, it's a nail in the coffin
Look, I shoot arms like heroin addicts
Look, a hater shit get drastic
You my son, they kill me, you end up a bastard. ha
I got the internet going nuts
Bitches hitting me on myspace say they want to suck him up
You want beef? What the fuck is up?
If so when we meet, I got heat for these 
When I spit, the realest will feel something
That's why I stay on the block, I'm still hustling
When you shit on the drop my shit pumping
A spot like a mailbox, it's where the bills come in
Me and Hurricane riding in an S5
Snatch a nigga up, take him for a test drive
Tie the nigga up, show him how the west ride
South Central LA, I'm a 
Where the best was born
Make sure your vest is worn
Cause nigga's will split ya chest when the Tec is drawn
Nigga's will split ya deck, then pull your card
Just try to act hard on the boulevard
You know it's me in the coupe when I'm speeding through
The fiend's say I whip colt like a vehicle
It's three birds, a bitch, brick, and four fifth
With them three, I take over the whole strip
No shit
The skinny nigga is no bitch
Know this, I'm so loyal to my 

Crusing through my hood to see whats good
My block considered Death Row but we ain't never signed to Suge
California, I got my heart in it
Disrespect, get ya shot, like I'm bartending
Me and Game we blood brothers with different pops
He the seed of Compton, I'm from Harlem, Watts
Hubbing a dub
Slugging a snub
Busting at any motherfucker who be fucking with us
This is Watts, California, gutterville, U.S.A.,
Gangbang capital, crackhouses, yellow tape
Riding through the city streets
Cannon right under my seat
Chopper in the back of the trunk, who want it with beef?
Seperate your soul from your flesh if you ever hate
Keep your comments to yourself, watch your soul levitate
South Central LA
Nigga it's the place to be
In my house, counting big money is the place for me
Blow good dro, and ride G rides
Gangbanging and cane slanging, the whole nine
Chuck Taylors, red strings, and khaki suits
Black & Milds, Chronic blunts, and Absolut
Killa Kali, fuck scrapping we clap you fool
Fuck the talk, bring your gat, we're blasting two's
From the block to the booth I'm the realest
Jay-Rock nigga and I do it for my 

Who the fuck want to snatch you from me?
And I don't chase bitches nigga I chase after money
Cannibal hungry
Trying to eat till my belly bust
I'm Cali raised, ghetto slang, you smelling us?
It's boss' life nigga
I put it down like I'm dropping the habit
Smoke an ounce and get up with more bounce than a rabbit
Got to have it like a crack fiend
Counting big face hundreds till my thumbs green
Interested in major money and power moves
Interfere and get em wet up like a shower do
That's how we do
Street sweep you when we ride up on ya
I represent that West Covina, California
Sixty-six hit more licks than a tootsie roll
Give me a mic, a bad bitch, and I'm good to go
Slow flow
Game cold like a eskimo
T.K.O. dawg
I think they better let it go
Lyrical arsenal
I heat it up, I like to flame a mic, {Topic loosen up}
I can't Game, my game to tight
I'm out of sight like Haley's Comet
Throw up my set, boss' life, like I'm sick and vomit
Bow down to the realest, nigga pay your homage
In the city of 600's and mostly Chronic, haha, West
And I'ma stay clutching, busting the trigger
Talk that shit, fuck around and get ride by us 

Ay, whose back in the 'Lac on white walls
Big body, the same color as Lysol
Hit the block up, if an enemy turn the lights off
And pull up on the fake ass nigga to turn his life off
Block out!, Block out!
Busting, watch the bike fall
I told em about them self-self made niggas, we ain't like y'all
We on some other ish
My goons will smother shit
From my Piru niggas down to them Eastside Crips
I thug like everyday's my last, ask Jesus
He never missed the beat of my heart, and won't neither
A true leader
In the Ferrari two-seater
Slide off to the spot, get bread, and kick my feet up
I'm knocking doors down
When I come around
Better have a nigga cheesey, everybody face down

Tam's Burger on the corner, slip up and get your issue
Drum fully loaded, probably catch 'em walking
Die for your name, get a blue or a cherry coffin
Pray for the homie moms, why she had to lose her son
We gon' make 'em pay the price for what they done
Organized crime, go on a mission weekly
187, man-down completely
Grew up off food stamps and swam through blood baths
Sheriffs hop out, point guns, searching your nutsacks
Support Compton, support Compton, support Compton
That's what Crips call it, but 'round here this Bompton
I ain't politicking, I ain't sneaking dissing
I'm really for my section, creeping up Wilmington
With my locs concealing weapons
Fucked with K. Dot back when he had the waves
And been supporting Game since the Aftermath chain

Baby let me know if you'll let me
You'll let me know, you'll let me know
You'll let me know, you'll let me know

Where the body cams at when they killed Sandra Bland though?
Where the justice system at when the cops go Rambo?
Black lives matter when we talkin' about Philando
But all lives matter when we talkin' bout Orlando
49 dead bodies, 83 in France though
They say Alton had a gun, we ain't see it in his hands though
We screamin' fuck the police but what about Dallas?
All these murders on the news
Every week it's another one, DJ Khaled
How we gon' respect the badge if you don't protect and serve?
They say life ain't a movie but it's feelin' like The Purge
And this rag in my pocket match the blood in the curb
Hear the shots in the hood but can they feel it in the 'burbs?
Turn on the news, get seduced by the words
And the noose on the black man's neck sounds absurd
Summer 16 look like more than a Drake song
And that's just this year, you forgot about Trayvon?

Baby you'll let me know, you'll let me know
You'll let me know, you'll let me know
You'll let me know, you'll let me know

Why it take 3 days for Obama to respond?
Cause Minnesota 3 days from the White House lawn
Trump and Hillary both cons
Backstab us like the bullets on in back of LaQuan
This ain't The Game, I come to you as Jayceon
With both of my hands up, don't shoot on my palms
Tamir Rice was just a kid and unarmed
Them cops was Cleveland fans, you just killed the next Lebron
We just need a resolution
When did being detained become a fuckin' execution?
Turn on the news, my stomach turnin' to knots
As the world keep turnin', 
I'm about to turn into Pac
I'm so determined, I promise to sing a sermon
Every night a mother dreads like Busta in Higher Learnin'
Candles burnin' so we marchin' up the blocks
Moment of silence every time a body drops
When the killin' gon' stop?
If they stop killin' us will we stop killin' cops?

Baby, you'll let me know, you'll let me know
You'll let me know, you'll let me know
You'll let me know, you'll let me know

Knowin' everybody can't stand us?
Don't they know that hate is a cancer?
Ask around, nobody got the answers
Now tell me, can you stand up?
Knowin' everybody can't stand us?
Didn't know we was livin' in Orlando
People dyin' with their hands up

Means more marijuana and less baby momma
You know I love you like I love my shoes

What's wrong? She my bitch and you my boo
She got a Range Rover Sport, you got a Bentley coupe
She take my clothes to the cleaners, you take Harlem to school
I gave you the Birkin bags so I made a mistake
And Oprah don't fuck with them no more anyway
I'm sorry for the bullshit I put you through
But I ain't goin' nowhere, I got a kid wit'chu
Why we always gotta argue about Superhead's book
She sucked my dick with a condom on, after that I shook
And when she start talking about buying a ring

Monsters In My Head,Hoodmorning (No Typo): Candy Coronas,2011.0,"And Jabez called on the God of Israel, saying
Oh that thou wouldest bless me indeed
And enlarge my coast, and that thine hand might be with me
And that thou wouldest keep me from evil, that it may not grieve me!
And God granted him that which he requested

I'm sittin' here watchin' my daughter being born
Feel like I should thank God that nothin' went wrong
Back in my days I was headed straight for the graveyard
Runnin' from school cause enemies never stay far
Wear my colors watchin' Colors
Chasin' after my older brothers
Cause they was always into shit
Good thing we had different mothers
Playin' football in the streets with the homies
And local drug dealers kickin' back makin' money
Cause the crack fiend was always there
So I start sellin' that cane cause nobody never cared
Mama at the post office workin' that late night shift
Takin' care of my sisters cause my daddy wasn't shit
Sweatin' over the stove and on a school clothes
Open the refrigerator like where did the food go
Tryin' to do whatever I can to be a man, hope you understand
Even when shit goes wrong it's part of God's plan, Amen

Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray to Lord my soul to keep
Wake me up before I'm dead
Don't bury me with monsters in my head (Yeah)
Monsters in my head, with monsters in my head
Underneath the bed, underneath the bed

Layin' here staring at this Doggystyle poster on my wall
Bangin' Snoop Dogg spinnin' this basketball
What the fuck is going on
In a nigga head
All of my homies gone to jail or they end up dead
Got my first tattoo tear when I was nineteen
Chasin' a pipe dream
Crenshaw boulevard chillin', that was the night scene
And like the movies, niggas act a fool
When you pushin' a Beamer, who gives a fuck about a school
Mom's set a curfew, but I was breakin' all the rules
Kicked a nigga out the house so I started forming my crew
Gettin' a little bigger on my own
In the twelfth grade Crips schemin' on me
Cause they know my trap self made, tryin' to get by or getting high
That's how I survived, be a leader not a follower
That's how them coward's die
Pay 'em no mind but keep my chrome to the end of time
Feeling like no nigga can see me I think they're going blind


Seemed like just yesterday a nigga was only 21
Showing the little homies how to use a fucking gun
Now look what I become, nigga was on the run
From the Compton slums, they right, like father like son
But I'm missing them days when I couldn't roll up a blunt
Bust the windows out of cars just to only drive it once
Yeah them was the days but now a nigga getting paid
Pouring down rose for my niggas in the grave
My nigga Big Will and my homie P D
Feel like yesterday we was just running in the streets
And I swear to God funny how the time fly
And the only thing certain is that we all die
So let your soul fly",https://genius.com/The-game-monsters-in-my-head-lyrics
Block Wars,Block Wars Original Soundtrack,2016.0,"You know what the fuck be pissing me off?
The other motherfuckers think they running my block
Jump off that fucking stoop, hit the fucking gate, nigga
Grab your burners it's time to go to war
I give the niggas the whole fucking clip
Every motherfucking round in this motherfucker you can get
Tell 'em it's a block war
Murder murder, murder murder
(Bongo 808)

Niggas run up on this red '64
You get a white tag on your big toe
These ain't punch lines, niggas kick doors
Leave your baby mama with her lip swole
All handguns, niggas pack light
Nigga's mouth loose but my strap tight
Niggas slide through and they bust first
We killin' everybody that night
Block wars, we bout that life
Scuffed J's and them fist fights
Dead bodies on dead bodies
Savage, that's what I live like
Go and chop a nigga head off
Fuck around, let the rounds hit you
Blood splattered on them niggas with you
All I had to do was give a signal
Magazines if you got an issue
Hit one nigga with the Source
Hit two niggas with the Vibe
Bitch I kill your vibe
It's a reason niggas can't fuck with Chuck
I'm a Compton nigga and I don't give a fuck
Nigga walk around with that pistol tucked
I do the drive-bys out a Bentley truck

(Murder murder) Whoo! Yeah
Have you ever seen a murder huh?
(Murder murder) Boom-boom-boom-boom, look

Have you ever seen a murder?
Have you ever seen a dead body?
Got a chopper with some rounds on it

No, nigga this ain't what you want, whoo, yeah
(Murder murder) Boop boom boom boom
(Murder murder) Whoo

Pull up on your block, take that shit over
Stolen choppers out of stolen Rovers
Supernova bullets rippin' through Corollas
Pure shooter like DeMar DeRozan
Hot slugs but the jewelry frozen
12 gauges on the trap sofas
Naked bitches in the kitchen whippin' yola
Pockets fat like the young Oprah
Told the nigga he ain't want the clip
I'm filthy rich and still with the shit
His mama cryin' but his son a bitch
I had her view the body like she from the 6
Bullets ricochetin' all through the block
Nigga run his mouth like he knew the cops
I do the shootin' while the shooters watch
Then cook crack in a noodle pot
Move me? Gotta move the block
That means take shots like it's Blue Dot
Niggas talkin' bout the game like it's ESPN
I'll put your ass with Stuart Scott
No conscious mind, the chronic got my mind blown
I can't stop with the murder shit
Burn rubber, burn a clip
A lot of niggas died on how they wear the shit

Shut the fuck up
Or get murdered murdered murdered
Have you ever seen a dead
Murder murder murder murder
Have you ever seen a dead body?
Have you ever seen a dead body? (whoo)

Everybody lay the fuck down, you know who it is nigga
Ay, what the fuck you doing? Nigga come here nigga
Gun in your motherfucking mouth

Nigga hatin on me cause I'm doin my own thang

I was in the fast lane before the G-Unit chain
You was hatin on Ja cause him and Irv went pop
Now yo' ass run around singin the ""Candy Shop""
After ""Westside Story,"" I took your fans
I seen it for myself, that bitch Olivia's a man
I got word from the wise, nigga you dead wrong
Stole the real 50's name and wouldn't pay for his headstone
Nigga got mad when ""How We Do"" start climbin
Actin like a bitch cause he ""Got Rich and Stopped Tryin'""
Got niggas locked up, you a snitch in Queens
Told 'em Touch shot 'Pac then rated out Supreme
But on the rizzeal, I'm talkin about you and me
Toe to toe, five-oh-C-E-N-T, faggot

Banks is a bitch, 50 is a bitch
Yayo is a bitch, Buck is a bitch

Yayo the only real motherfucker from the street
You swingin on me like you want five heartbeats
Okay 1, 2, 3 4 flatline
If you say you wrote my shit one mo' time
You ain't a hood nigga you ""Got Rich and Stopped Tryin'""
Jimmy scared Chris Lighty and Jay stop lyin
You a snitch, what'chu know about movin in silence
Even N.Y.P.D. can't deny it
The life of your story is fuckin Vivica
But your baby momma left you cause you couldn't get it up, bitch

Yayo went to jail, Banks sold a mill'
Then Buck sold a mill' then 50 gave a deal
To a bitch named Olivia who titties ain't real
Now they all hidin behind the police shield

So he was left alone by himself a lot
So shit, he did whatever the fuck he wanted to do
When Boyz n the Hood came out, this little nigga rolled himself a joint
And watched the whole motherfucker by itself
His pops didn't give a fuck, but his mom found out?
Shit, she'd kill him and his dad
She didn't want him seeing, being or getting caught up in no gangsta shit
So she never knew, until now",https://genius.com/The-game-dr-dre-1-lyrics
Hustler’s Dream,The Face of L.A,2009,"(Intro: Game)
Dre and Vidal
Niggas play everything live, nigga
Like Kool & the Gang back in the day
Nigga play it live, nigga
Fuck you niggas know about making beats?
You don't know shit
Pussies (Ha ha)
Fuck you ever seen a nigga in his 20's with a guitar, bitch?
(Verse 1: Game)
Mother's only son, so I
Had to knock a nigga the fuck out on the block if he
Made my sisters cry
I was O-Dog in Larenz Tate's dreams
Red everything niggas know what I mean
Red rag top and I made the dash pop
Before niggas came with stash spots, man
I was a dope man, dope man
I tried to tell em' I could never be a felon
I was too good at sellin' crack, X, speed and heroin
Fiends call me Monroe, cause I used to kill em' down in Marilyn
Puttin' niggas underground give me a shovel
He still alive fuck him, I was on that level
Back then I ain't believe in God
If they heal like they say on TV, why bullets leave a scar?
Revenge is a feelin, but on my son's life
When I catch the two niggas that shot me I'mma, kill em'
(Hook: Anthony Hamilton)
Desperate moments I've been waiting all my life (All my life)
No mistakes I promise this will be my time (My time)
I know hustlin' leads us to an early grave
But it's the only way, how come niggas dying every day?
(Verse 2: Game)
I watched the coke price double up
I was too young to be a cook, so I had to sit back and watch it bubble up
Sittin' in the window seein' gang bangers knuckle up
Watchin' the wind blow girls' skirts while they double dutch
I had straight D's I wasn't in much trouble much
Either you do my homework for me or I'mma fuck you up
Moms lied for me told her friends I was a nice student
Would a' had all A's if algebra was Ice Cube
There it is, I studied a veteran
Hoping that one day I could be a fucking hip hop legend
I listened to Nas, Big, Dre, Snoop
And even though Pac hated him, I bumped Jay too
Bought Reasonable Doubt and let it play straight through
Used to throw my head back, like Kanye do
Niggas never thought that I would break through
Irv Gotti, and P Diddy passed but Jimmy and Dre knew
(Hook: Anthony Hamilton)
Desperate moments I've been waiting all my life
No mistakes I promise this will be my time
I know hustlin' leads us to an early grave
But it's the only way, how come niggas dying every day?
(Bridge: Game and Anthony Hamilton)
A.H take em' to church
Our father who art in Heaven
Hallowed be thy
Name
Thy kingdom come thy founding father
Protect the Game (Yes sir)
Please show the way (Yes)
Open up the gate
(Yes)
Free us from pain (Yes sir)
But it's the only way, how come niggas dying every day?
(Verse 3: Game)
I'm talking to my niggas, All Stars and Timberlands
(North face is a pin and it's a million thugs marching)
For the dearly departed I elevated my knowledge
They say that I was name droppin', I was just paying homage
For Lil' E and Tiana, I'm sayin' that dear mama help me read between the lines pass periods and
Commas
The million dollar baby young homie tryna' prosper
Act like you don't see me, you might win a Oscar
Act like you don't see me, I might just pop ya
Niggas singing like Sinatra I box like Bernard Hopkins
Left jab like Oscar, I'm the golden boy
You niggas seen what happened to Roy
Yeah, you niggas seen what happened to
Roy
On my block niggas box we the knockout boys
Sitting in the throne with the doja sparkin', it's my seat and I ain't moving like Rosa Parks
Ima be here

Taylor Made,Purp & Patron,2013.0,"Let me introduce you to the Taylor Gang
That's my nigga Wiz and 
I’m Chuck Taylor mane
We both known in our hoods like Chuck Taylors mane
We get high, fuck hoes, and roll paper planes...
Cause we Taylor made, we the Taylor gang
Blowing smoke into the face of those haters mane
We all stars in the hood like Chuck Taylors mane
So throw it up and keep repping the Taylor gang, if you Taylor made...

I wake up in the morning to Red Converse
Dre Beats
 on, listening to 
Bomb first
You got a hangover nigga, mine’s worse...
Haze got me 
kicking knowledge like a Nas verse
Shit be complicated like out of towners trying to understand why we say: ""Whaddup Blood"" but we not related
That's how Compton made it
So don’t run around yelling Soo Woo without a Chuck Taylor confirmation
On that documentary shit I shocked the nation
Muhammad Ali shit like I boxed in Vegas
When it come to beef shit, nigga I’m the greatest
I knew I was next the night they shot 'Pac in Vegas
I ain't a killer but don’t push me
I see a bitch looking, I’mma end up in her pussy
See ya later, fuck haters, cause bitch we Taylors
Bitch we major...


Probably heard I’m the tightest
And I heard that you never smoked so I rolled it, you light it
And I heard that you liked it
And I welcome you to my world you’ve been cordially invited
Now I got the whole world excited
Know every word when they heard that I write it
Know I can fuck every girl cause my jewelry the brightest
And my herb is the lightest
Some niggas mad I made it, blame it all on perfect timing
I say I made it big cause I stuck to the cursive writing
These niggas rather be a has-been
Then not be famous at all
I learned you ain’t really gotta be famous to ball
I’m hustling hard, and turning bitches to customers
Soon as they get in front of us
Bad hoes after the shows rushing up
Baby them niggas clowns talk down but they look up to us
May look the same but I’m nothing like them suckas
 so fuck what them niggas sayin’ and keep reppin’ the Gang...",https://genius.com/The-game-taylor-made-lyrics

And hold this shit round
Hold this shit down
Come move them things for me
Across town, town
And make sure they touchdown
Just makin' it in town
And make sure they touchdown, touchdown

Uhuh, I need a gangster bitch
Nigga I ain't lyin', Im talkin' when I fuck
She scream you hear sirens
No domestic violence
Just domestic diamonds
So let me ice you out
So when you slidin' down the pole
Doin' your Magic City thing
Your neck and wrist glow
Im dreamin', she ain't a stripper, she a classy girl
Goin' off that Patron, she my nasty girl
First name, Rachael, last name Jones
You related to Nas, girl, Queens my second home
You know, Prince Akeem coming with a Semmi and we can tear it up
Weekend in Cannes, then we coming to America
She wears those Jimmy Choos but she love that Gucci, never been to ATL
But she love that Gucci, Brrr
She taught me how to cook Cajun
And I taught her how to cook crack
And I chopped it on her back
Now tell me where they do that


I put her on a Greyhound
She know she better stay down
Ride or die like my Bentley
Man this bitch will never break down
She my bustin' baby, you should see her bust a tre pound
Love Roc-A-Fella so much, she won't even call me Jay now
She roll my weed man, like she my weed man
Then we get high, play Tiger Woods on that Wii, damn
Love is for a season, haters 365
And the game Cats and Dogs, keep your bitch by your side
Got a hardtop Lambo, when the rain start to pour
Not the rain outside, talkin the rain indoors
Her girlfriend told her, that I was creepin with a stripper
Told her I was courtside, watchin' the wack ass Clippers
Bitch please, I'm a Laker fan and Kobe that's my nigga
Keep my grass cut so I can see when the snake slith her
Shit, came out of no where like Khloe and Lamar
Kind of got a nigga thinkin' maybe I'm


I let her drive the Range on our first date
She the first one to put me on that Drake mixtape
I just wanna be successful baby
Take you out them Hudson jeans and re-dress you baby
We can walk down Rodeo, turn around, you on Melrose
Fly to New York in the winter and try on some Timbos
Or we can hit South Beach, fuck with Ross and Timbo
The world is cherry pie, and we can slice it up like Kimbo
You cook the rock, I break it down
I wrap it up, you weigh them pounds
I make the call, you start the car
We can drive it out of town
Im your nigga right? And you my bitch (Yeah)
Even if they lock me up, she gon' get them bricks there
When we get tired, we hit the truck stop and sit there
Unzip my 501's and she gon' put her lips there

Soon as the water dry im going straight at that Porsche
Turn a Maybach into a corpse, me and my Maserati got a divorce
Yeah


I've been on Fab since we were both catching cabs
And he was getting off bags on nostra ave
My New York hood pass cause we was running through Brooklyn
He got on first, the next year they let the crook in

Quick to grab my Smith & Wesson like my dick was missing
To protect my position, my corner, my lair
While we out here, say the Hustlers Prayer
If the game shakes me or breaks me
I hope it makes me a better man
Take a better stand

Get my daughter this college grant so she don't need no man

Only make moves when your heart's in it
And live the phrase sky's the limit

Four Bent supposed to be here, I should dig him up

15 years of greatness
15 years of hatin'
15 years of patience, that's what I had to practice
So I ain't end up back on that county jail mattress
Fuck all this rap shit
In Compton we in the dirt, sticks on us like a cactus
Cincinnati on, closin' on the third strap
Gave two away to some fans, this my third hat
Runnin' this marathon, I'm on my third lap
Where my key to the city, don't y'all think I deserve that?
L.A. sheriffs left Ryan on the curb, flat
37 shots, so I'm on 133rd strapped

40oz love, white Air Force Ones in the mud
Euro front end on the Cutlass like, ""What's up?""
See my dead homie mama, hop out and give her a hug
40oz love, niggas gon' ask, so choose one, Crip or Blood
Money fallin' out your pocket while you're sellin' drugs
And we drinkin' Old English, grab a cup, I'll fill it up for you

You outta gas? I'll fill it up for you
You surrounded in the club? We pullin' up for you
You went to jail? I took that money, put it up for you
You still got your hand out like I ain't did enough for you
You put on that snitch jacket and it stuck to you
On my life, I love you but I can't fuck with you
I gotta stick to the code
Never slip, never fold, and stay rich 'til I'm old
Love my kids on my soul
Both my baby mamas know if I go, open the safe and give 'em all the gold
And my cousin, Magic Cold, he in the pen on his toes
How you talk them people into transferrin' you to a level 4?
He got 20 months left, that shit movin' hella slow
20 blunts, half a pound a day until they let him go
I give him 30 racks every time he touch the surface
I'm startin' to think this nigga goin' to jail on purpose

Either way, I gotta keep givin' you 40oz love

Can’t do it, money we runnin through us
So competition throw the towel in
We over here, with fireworks up in the air
Bitches with good hair, cause you know we about to spark
Bobby Ray just walked in, Wiz about to park
The party bout to start, jewellery glowing in the dark
We got all these bitches wet, Skylar Diggins from the arc
And you know your boy is sharp, cause she in my bed
I tell her take her clothes off, and open her legs
And keep them Louboutins on when she giving head
Cus you already know my favorite colour RED!
Im gettin bread while im

Standing on the corner
Washing my lolo
I got my dime in the crib, ironin' my Polo
Soon as your boy hit the streets, you know that I’m clean
So fresh and so clean, Outkast know what I mean
I throw that Andre 3000, one in the changer
And I dont ride through the hood, with out one in the chamber
You know I used to broke but, now nigga I'm getting it

As I roll up up, I sit back and laugh in amazement
As how this all started in the bottom of a basement
Back when I got started, nigga say “your shit is basic”
Now when you mention me, you must say Grammy nominated
All these haters drunk of hate, they basically wasted
Call a cab for these niggas, cause they ain't gon make it
Can somebody please tell me just where Bobby Ray is
Well he’s prolly faded, prolly in a spaceship
Prolly outside of his mind, cus you know he crazy
But I kind of dig his style, its pretty contagious
Man them groupies prolly doing him all kind of favors
I mean, it’s gotta be absolutely outrageous
Well, I couldn’t tell you what it is
More people tell me that they down, the bigger that I get
But I just keep doing my thang, cruise control in my own lane
And let these suckas complain

I'm standing on the corner, watching the world go
I got my dime in the crib, rollin' up that dojo
Soon as your boy hit the stage you know the screaming
Its that pandemonium, if you know what I mean
I throw that Eastside up, welcome to Decatur
And on the Westside, I hit the homie Game up

I used to be unknown
Now the niggas listening
Big money talk, big joint to spark
These Jordans on my feet, that’s how big money walk
Shorty give me head, like she don’t need body parts
Running my city like the King of New York
Popping champagne, hit him with the cork
Eating so good, nigga need a fork
And I ball hard, nigga need a court
The way lil mama give me brain
I swear she must have been a dork
Duh! You know me I keep one rolled up
Smoking with my bitch from overseas, where my Porsche from
And these hating niggas get no love
I be rolling weed, getting rich, fucking they bitch
Letting you spend all of your M, you send her on trips
I meet her there, you know, cuase you smell the weed in her hair
You worried bout me cause we keeping it player, instead you failed
Treated her fair, don’t need to look, she in the air

Standing on the corner, talking that shit
You ain’t really saying nothing, just hating on pimpin'
Every time i’m in my car i’m smoking that green
Even though this real life, its like a movie scene
I ain’t in the club, if I don't blaze up
It don’t matter where I go, I’m throwing my gang up
Nobody used to know me but but
Now a nigga famous, now a nigga famous",https://genius.com/The-game-standing-on-a-corner-lyrics
Children’s Story,Purp & Patron,2011.0,"Uncle Chucky, Will you read us a bedtime story please huh please?
Alright... You kids get to bed I'll get the story book...
Here we go...

Slam the impala door hopped out what do you see
Some niggas hangin' on the fence lookin' at me
I had phat red laces in my Adidas
Big chain around my neck like mardi grass
So I stepped up to them is there a problem here?
One nigga lifts his shirt then he yells out ""yeah""
So I turned around quickly and jumped in my car
I was about to hit the switch then I thought like ""nahh""
So I reached under my seat, and I grabbed my shit
It was a chrome four five with the kung fu grip
Stuffed it inside my dickies as I jumped out the car
Kept my hand on the trigger as I walked to the store
One nigga walks in, then here comes two
""what did you do?""
I shot!
Are you crazy fool?
One nigga hit the ground then the other two scrammed
Now the cops are outside
Well i'll be damned
It was 7:15 on my rolex watch
And I can't do the time that my rolex got
And like the hands on the clock, I went this way, thatta way
Ran around the corner, and that's when I threw my gat away
And impala passes, its my homeboy clyde
He gave me the hand signal, so I jumped in his ride
It was a clean six fo, original inside
With no key in the ignition
Where'd you get this clyde?
Nevermind, I'm out, its a stolen whip
And I'm already runnin' from the cops and shit
So I hopped out the car like the Dukes of Hazzard
Then clyde yells out ""you stupid bastard""
Start runnin though traffic and I almost get hit
I lost one of my shoes, its my airforce, shit
I'm haulin down the street with one shoe on
Walked straight into some niggas with all blue on
I only ran 30 blocks, how I end up in long beach
Cause in california the gangs in arms reach
He seen my red strings so he punched and caught me
So I knocked his ass out and took his boy out his barklys
I ain't seen these since 92'
I'm feelin like a bad boy without the shiny suit
Here the cops come, shit, so I dash behind a honda
And look who's here my baby momma's friend Rhonda
In the car kissin on this dope dealer, Chris
Little did he know he was suckin my dick
I start bangin' on the window, I don't mean to disturb
But Chris can you drop me off downtown, on third
He said why sure, waddup game hop in
He was bangin slick rick then I got an idea
Before we get to third drop me off right here
So I can walk inside the mall and cop some new gear
As I walked in the store they could see I was in a rush
So they bought me some jeans, a t-shirt and fresh chucks
Walked out the store, looked left, oh no
Ran back in the store, here comes the 5-0
So I ran real quick, made a move to the back
And knocked a cute bitch into a polo rack
Said sorry, jumped over her and fled to the back door
Then I kicked the shit open, you won't believe who I saw
Its the nigga chris in handcuffs, pointin at me
And the cops made him chase me before they let Chris free
One cop tried to grab me, and the other one missed
I got away with more time, and they both got pissed
Ran straight out the mall, spotted this blue coupe
'dogg pound' on the plates, that's gotta be Snoop
So I ran up the car and said yo snoop
The cops got me on the run need a ride nephew
Hell yeah bigg snoop, little homie hop in
He dropped me off in compton, that's when my story ends
Now this ain't funny so don't you dare laugh
Just another story about the wrong path
I had a big day, so I reclined my seat
It was a 20 minute ride to the C.P.T
Walked straight up to the house, pulled out my key
Opened my door it's my girl playin...",https://genius.com/The-game-childrens-story-lyrics

Lamborghini top unless I call it Lil' Kim

Iceberg on my chest no man on my ring

Leave that nigga at the bar
Got some tint on my Ferrari, This movie is rated R
Ya girlfriends is extra’s, Baby you a star
And its time to burn rubber no stuntman involved
Doing a 100 on the highway, pulling on my gear shift
Your girl got her hand on my cock but I ain’t Will Smith

Used to be my Ace, now you wastin' my Hennessy
The remedy for haters is crap tables in Vegas
That crack ain't gettin' it lately
I'm stackin' that paper, baby
Maybe I should get a maybe, or maybe I should call Baby
My cash money is crazy, I crashed up my Mercedes
Bought me a Ferrari, the license plates say ""Sorry""
The insides safari, the paint job Amar'e
When the sun hit that bitch, man
Bounce off them 24's and land on my wrist band
You better keep your arm on yo' bitch, man
Or you gon' be Jamal Crawford - sixth man
Comin' off that bench man, and it's a shame man
Yo' bitch gon' make it rain up in here


I brush them haters off, like ""fuck outta here""
Open up my garage, pull that Porsche truck outta there
Like ""fuck outta here, I'm up outta here""
Jump on my hog, throw on that Rough Ryder gear
I'm a rider, yeah, I'm a roller bitch
I might be through with Benz', like here, hold this 6
I get money with the players, they duckin', dodgin' Feds
For my bread, bring the lead, cause I'm sittin' on the edge
Actin' like I don't get it, actin' like I don't hustle
Actin' like I don't Diddy, actin' like I don't Russell
Then you wonder why I be, actin' like I don't trust you
If you ain't with me, then fuck you, next time I see you, I cut you
How mad was you? Cause last time I felt the negative energy
Nigga, I could have snuffed you
Bye hater, cause I'm feelin' like Jada

This is not livin’
Livin’ is when you working a 9-5
Liftin’ heavy ass boxes just to stay a-fucking-live
Nigga ain't got a car but he got drive
So he appreciate the rims sittin on his ride
The world going crazy, niggas going crazy
They say the Illuminati affiliated Jay-Z
I’m in this Mercedes seeing how L.A be
My life should be a movie shot by Martin Scorsese
Gun’s off safety niggas is Polamalu
The cops killed BIG and drove off in the Impala
And Pac did his just to get a couple dollars
Fuck rap, I shoulda took my black ass to college

I’m just tryna be real
I’m just keepin’ it real
I’m just tryna be real
I’m just keepin’ it real
I’m just keepin’ it real

I’m tryna see my kids through college before I gotta die
Still sayin’ R.I.P Aaliyah ‘fore I gotta fly
Niggas running out of time
So they doing homocide
Gotta take the stand tell the judge and jury their alibi
And they all racist so they giving boys 25
Stand up be a man, and stare straight into his momma eyes
And she still traumatised, her baby boy shot up
Kissed him on the forehead right before he got up
You shot him in the forehead twice before he got up
All over a bitch, nigga the devil wears Prada
Amber Rose wears nada
And thats how she should keep it
’cause you can go Tyra from wearing Victoria’s Secrets
They say there’s a secret society
To get notoriety from selling your soul to ‘em
Nigga you ain't buying me
Only thing for sale is this Phantom
It’s Aftermath, thats why I rep the A like Atlanta


They say I look like Kanye or Wale in this Louis napsack
Rather be them than them dumb niggas fucking with Kat Stacks
I smoke kush to get my mind right
I used to listen to Nas to get my rhymes tight
I used to sell them dimes and keep my 9 tight
But now I’m fucking them dimes, but in hindsight
Almost turned on my family for the limelight
And I’mma go see God when the times right
They say the pearly gates white but my President black
My money green, the sky blue and that's where heaven is at
I don’t carry a gat, but my niggas do
It’s like my jumper is off, I let my niggas shoot
And don’t none of my niggas do
Take the time to listen
I’ll tell you what my niggas do

It got me feelin like a slave so I gave it to his pops in his memory
Loadin up the Glock, takin shots of that Hennessey
Layin on this table, getting tatted
And don’t worry about who get it ‘cause we at em
That’s on the block
I know you standin next to Pac
Throwin up the west side, polo down to the socks
And I’m selfish cuz I want you here
But you gone so it’s chronic smoke in the air
And you know bad ass got a hot head
So it’s on til a motherfucker drop dead
And even though it won’t bring you back
I’m sittin on Rose clan, just me and my strap
Watching as the cars pass

While I’m swerving on this highway
Reminiscing bout the time I joked about your cap
And how you wore that polo hat
Hangin off yo head, point it to the back
Same smile since you was 10
And King Frog had you on his shoulders
Yelling Cedar burnin through the trap
Time flies, now we chasin all these hood rats
West side, you a diamond rollin through the hood, up and down the block
Pocket full of cash, fresh J’s on the gas
Hop in the 1-10, meet the homies in the lot
Following this upper club and bout all the Ciroc
And remember when I bought your first bottle of sprays
Always down for yo niggas so you gave it to D Shade
So I brought a couple mo bottles, gold bottles
How a young seater becomes another’s role model
Til we meet again

I was holdin on
Your funeral is jumped up
Cemetery flamed out, all the homies burnt up
Tryin not to shed a tear but I couldn’t hold it
Your daddy took it like a G and everybody know it
I told yo mama yesterday I got er and I do
As long as they printin money and I’m bangin pyroo
If one of the kids needs something, niggas comin through
They don’t just go for his, all the homie’s kids too
And look how them niggas did you
Homie stretched out, retaliation is sketched out
And we at it to the day’s end
Bustin on my enemies til it cave in
And to my brother face and my homie slim roo
You know I got this
And these going up, you got a hood full of riders
Laugh now, cry later, the sucker niggas that shut up
We part 'em, red seas in these impalas

Kush, piff in it, every white string infinite
You different, last night, niggas picturin'
Seven times, had a black chick tryin' white shit
Federline, I’m the future, real beef, I’ll shoot you
Walk-walk, no talk-talk, no sub and no woofers
It's on, tell by my tone
Real nigga call, better answer your phone


So viele Nieten im Biz machen auf Gees in dem Biz
Es ist wie ihr Rückgrat - viel Wirbel um Nichts
Und viele deutsche Rapper glauben, dass sie flowen
Wo sind alle hin, tz, ich glaube, dass sie flohen
Ich komm mit Haufen von Kanonen und tausenden Patronen
Plus paar skrupelloser Gangster aus der Kaukasus-Region
Bedroh' dich mit Winchesters
Mein Waffenfetisch ist nicht mehr in den
Griff zu kriegen wie ein verbogenes Springmesser
Ich baller' Rapper ab, knall' dann deren Sluts
Naja, was man halt alles als Gewaltverbrecher macht
Doch hab' ich den Alltagsstress mal satt
Besuch' ich dich auf Intensivstation und schalte etwas ab
Du hast Liebeskummer, Kid, ich schiebe Nummern mit
Deinem Girl, geb' ihr den Cock, wo sie nie genug von kriegt
Roll' im Beamer rum und blick' beim Online-Banking nie
Welche Zahl da Kontostand und welche IBAN-Nummer ist


Don't fight it baby
Don't fight the feelin'
You know a nigga tryna fuck
I like that bitch, teah, baby
Your pussy wet? Take them panties off
Don't fight it, let a nigga hit that shit
You like to fuck, all these bitches love fuckin'",https://genius.com/The-game-or-nah-german-version-lyrics

Three-wheelin the 64 (my lowrider) hop in the low low (My my lowrider)
Chrome hydraulics, all black impala (My my lowrider, My my lowrider)

I see 'em tryin shine like Tech
Cause I shine like I be grinding on the set, 
d-d-diamonds on my neck
Most talked about when I hit that strip, watch it bounce when I hit that dip
Come too close might get that clip, click BANG
Don't trip, Tech don't slip, laces up the roll go get my bitch
Get my grip, talk my shit, hit my switch and dip
Switchin lanes on them Dana Danes, same color as that candy paint
Tangerine with (I can't tell the rest cause of E-40)

I tried to never sober, chalupa, longer then a roller coster
Out hear a head a hub a head and do ya for quarter ounce of yollup
Venomos snakes, like some cobras, up top is where I'm from
We be lettin our nuts hang over our shoulders, figure 8 and go and duck
Droppin with all 4 doors open, gassin and brakin and yolkin
We hyphy, we stupid valeho, Richmond, Frisco, Oakland
We 9ers, we raiders, we some hustlers and some players
We've got 64s and low lows, but most of us rider scrapas

Lord forgive me it in me to sent me to tote semi's
Gulp Henny and Remy my pockets was so skinny
Now I blow pennies on 4 hemi's
Run the whole city/hoes, I put dough before any
My 6th sense helped me view better cheddar kid
I fucks mo hoes then Hugh Heffner ever did
That new leather shit the coup hell sick
Dude move ahead of who ever cause dude never quit

Cranberry impala, that's my lowrider
Slide by your north sider rider with a ho driver
G'd up from the feet up plus the heat tough
Toe game crack the grey goose and spark the weed up
When I'm in LA I go in Crenshaw and floss a little
Slot a lot thang in that Black Wall Street
Double U and P and CPT we keeping it G
In our low riders riders riders

We put them cracks up on the wall, cucarachas crawl
I keep my head up and it won't fall, no not at all
I'll break ya jaw like a break the law, leave you all in all
The lowrider so low, you won't know what you saw
I sit low with a tall can, in a brown bag
With a brown rag, bouncing a brown rag
With the Mexican flag and the American flag
Hitting the fronts and the backs, watching out for the bash

Home boy, Big T, better know as Tyrone
Is the first person I ever seen with a chevy on chrome
My parter bought it got the slab, wine berry over gold
With screen in the head rest just to let you know we holding
I fell in love with it, and I dropped him some cash
Now that's me you see flippin slab, riding on glass
How much it cost, don't ask, baby just know this
I could bought a Benz instead with the money I spent

Three-wheelin the 64 (my lowrider) hop in the low low (My my lowrider)
Chrome hydraulics, all black impala (My my lowrider, My my lowrider)

My 64 sittin on that chrome, chrome Glock sitting on my lap
2 hoes ridin in the back, candy paint, nigga fuck with that
3-wheel motion, I'm sitting high, daytonas, that's all we ride
Hit that switch its do or die, ride on me that's suicide
I be in the hood smoking that green, Dr.Dre know what I mean
Swisha sweet and them purple leaves, California, we got that weed
Black diamonds off in my chain/ ask around nigga know my name
Compton own, the rap Lebron James, ridin low, I'm switchin lanes

Make that brain splat 30 thang thang clap
Know for the game rap with the chrome frame wrap
From Harley Davidsons to low lows, we do tip 'em
13 hundred spokes with that blue nibble get the picture
Disrespect and I'm draw slugs
But ain't no set trippin cause nigga its all love
Dub C drop the real on 'em, chevy chrome grill on 'em
Posing in the intersection, 3-wheelin on 'em nigga

Rasberry 64 bring your cherry
And we could make a Sunday, come home Monday
I'm sittin on the one-way, up on the Boulevard
Act hard, put ya thoughts on the dashboard
Cause if I come through the hood with the little homie
Nobody better fuck with the little homie
I hope Compton unite, South Central unit
I hope my chrome, and dance with the moon light

Grown full, I never move how a coward move
Never heard of defeat bitch, I don't know how to lose
Thought it would end, but it seems we ain't done

California king, I put that on my kids, I am
Tell Kendrick I passed the torch and I meant it, every sentence
Spoke to the crowd 'til the crown got passed down, I'm bitchin’
On the stage with Snoop and the Pound, that was so vintage
Long way from the crowd, I'm poppin'  benches
Like a hurdler, any lyricist murderer
Unless 3 Stacks or Blueprint, Jigga is on the verse with 'em
Your top 10 no match for my top 5
All you niggas is lucky, Will Smith after Pac died
Thug Life, west side, let one of you pop fly
I hold the Glock sideways like Ashanti's cocked eye
I look in my opp's eyes tellin' me not God
Make his body do the block boy and leave him lopside
I am dope at the border in the narco cop eye
I am chicken in the grill of a Cutlass like Popeye's
I am Jay, Dames, and Biggs while watchin’ the Roc rise
Nigga, you could shake the jar, just don’t let the pot slide
I am both of the clips in Drake's beat
Take advantage, fuck all of these bitches while Drake sleep
I’ma start with Keke and K.B., go up in 'em, 8 feet
Make her clit tick like an 8-peat

Roll them maple leaves, Degrassi inside this wheelchair
Smokin' on this real, yeah, Draco, let it kill air
Weave on the track and make 'em think that it's my real hair

Left my dick inside her long as I waited for Carter 5
I am the Lakers' starter 5
I am Eazy-E immortalized

Tellin' bitches if they ain't shooters, they better call a ride
Put a chopper on the seat and let it sing like L.M.I
Get it poppin' with this heat like it's a McDonald fry

Talk to Prodigy the night before he died
Said he happy to be alive, where you at? We should ride
Woke up to the news that my nigga died
So I borrowed the tear ducts from Havoc eyes and I cried
So I'm mobbin' deep for the rest of my life
Can't call my peace out the world without my knife
I don't fuck with Grammys ever since they fuckin' dissed me
Took my lil' horn and gave that motherfucker to Missy
Guess I'm too much, Thug Life, notorious, they don't get me
Fuck it, I'm in this Bentley
I'm too much real nigga for real nigga and Trump

25 To Life,Hoodmorning (No Typo): Candy Coronas,2011.0,"I was sentenced to a 5 album deal in '02
Spent the next couple years trying to figure out who was who
Met this New York nigga they called him Boo Boo
So we chopped it on the yard and he put me down with his crew
We was the hardest niggas in the penitentiary
Got a little bigger since Jimmy Iovine sentenced me
Sat back in my cell and wrote The Documentary
I ain't make no friends in jail, just enemies
A lot of bad memories, fucked up tendencies
Even bumped heads with this Young Buck from Tennessee
Say he got connects in Nashville got them 10 a key
Shit, we finna see, nigga knew I been a G
Never needed The Unit, thats how them niggas remembered me
Yo C.O. coming I'mma holla in a minute B
Niggas on the yard tripping, I ain't got the energy
Had a couple jail fights them niggas couldn't finish me

25 to life
No fucking Parole
Just animals in this bitch and I ain't trusting a soul
So while im up in here I might as well make the best of it
And pray to the lord he take care of the rest of it
25 to life
Got me feeling like im stuck
Only reason I survived because I dont give a fuck
Nothing but bad luck
And I ain't never cried a tear
Never going home, nigga fuck around and die here

Im getting sick and tired of these newcomers
Ive been locked up for more than a few summers
Still gotta do numbers, still gotta do numbers
Looking at pictures of Keri Hilson on the wall, dick hard as a cucumber
Relax my mind, hit the yard and shoot a few jumpers
Really wanna shoot something, who the fuck wanna do something
This lifer named esco
Told me I was the hardest nigga to ever hit the yard since Pac was on Death Row
Im about to go fuck with my niggas on D block
Cause he know what to do when these niggas be taking cheap shots
Ask a nigga how long he got, he said about 9
Then we start having conversations about Shyne
Homie just got out, shit its about time
We click cause he about his and nigga im about mine
So not near a nigga here can talk about Shyne and Lil Wayne neither
Get your pussy ass outlined


Niggas ain't stopping me
Especially with me and my nigga 
Beans from
 state property
I could feel it in the air
Niggas up in here is scared
Niggas up in here is queers
Niggas up in here is dead
I think you a c.o
I think you a fed
Snitches get stitches thats the type of shit we do in here
Who the fuck is you in here
You fucking with a killer
Better have a lion heart fucking with a dealer
Reputations get ruined here play the game to win
Guns, I pack 10, the UCLA Bruin here
None of you fresh fish niggas couldn't do a year
Let alone a life sentence
I know R&B niggas harder than yall
Nigga Lyfe Jennings
Lloyd tried to rob my bank and got his fucking life ended
Now that I think about it dog, im starting to like prison
Next niggas get out of line I stick my knife in them",https://genius.com/The-game-25-to-life-lyrics

So who it may concern, you'll get your whole mouth wide
Fuckin with them gang bangers in the SOUTHSIDE

Nas just walked by, nigga this is ether
I'm going down classic like that nigga B.I.G serves
My niggas pushing them key's til' they see dirt
The spot is the pharmacy and the block is where we work
Niggas standing on the corner, look at these jerks
The heat starts flashing, make 'em run til' they feet hurt

Bricks make me numb, from the tip of my tounge

I am the truth, brand new coupe
Run the place, 
take you straight back
To Martin Luther roots
Pistol never fail me, official Alex Haley

Hailed as a boss, nailed to the cross
Rose from the dead, that Rolls Royce cost

I can be in all peach and wet me a Curtis Jack
I can smell the rat, still count my cheese
Count my money,

Niggas got a V12 engine mouth 'till I bust that chrome
They screamin' like a bitch
When them hollow tips crush them bones
When I call 50, Banks and Young Buck is on
They bring heavy artillery when I chirp that phone
Grew up with the holy ghost went to church from home
Bad Boy since birth like Justin Combs
Been to the county jail once, it ain't feel like home
Promised to never go back if niggas left me alone
But the 'hood is the 'hood, niggas hate to see me get money
So I cut the grass so I can see the snake niggas comin'
They don't want me to be the best so I prepared for the worst
You got a Teflon vest? Let me see if it works

Niggas spend the rest of they life try to put me under
But until the day I die, G-Unit gone ride
Niggas spend the rest of they life try to put me under
Hate all you want from your living room but don't come outside
Niggas spend the rest of they life try to put me under
If u wanna witness the album, come see if I'm 'bout it
Niggas spend the rest of they life try to put me under
Try and I'll make you my bitch, nigga suck my dick

Seem like every other city I go niggas is fake
Down bottom L.A. to uptown New York state
No disrespect to my fans, I mean a nigga that'll shake your hand
Kiss your daughter on the cheek, snitch on you then take the stand
Nigga that live by the motto money make the man
He ain't gotta walk home, the sergeant let him take the van
And Quik said dollaz' make sense So I'mma interior decorate his Impala, give 'em red tints
They ain't got those in 3-1-0
Or West Coast Customs fuck 'em and any who love 'em
I spend a million on bail thats nothin', show me his 'hood
I'll crush him G-Unit get money and niggas gotta suffer

Niggas spend the rest of they life try to put me under
But until the day I die, G-Unit gone ride

So when the thangs come out you better run
Home I'm scared, for the sake of my new born kid
'Cause I might have to do life in the pen
Homie I'm scared, to kneel down and wash away my sins
Try me and I'll do it again
Homie I'm scared I've been behind the trigger more than once
What's gone happen to me when God comes

I'm focused like a Kodak lens
Park my Aston Martin by the garden, tell 'em to hold that thing
I'm back in Cali, twistin' up the Cali
Palm trees and the breeze make it feel like Maui
Guess this how a nigga 'posed to feel
When you 29 sittin' on 29 mil
I don't make up with bitches, I get me a new Cover Girl
One I can trust, no holes inside the rubber girl
I fuck all girls, tall ones, thick bitches
Drove my car down Broadway, hit switches
Been through Queens with 50 and Lamborghins
Drove through Texas in a brand new Lexus
GS shit, the best shit, I mess wit'
The further I go down south, better the sex get
But that's me, sippin' on Dom P
Blowin' Cali's finest, I don't mean palm trees

Valet cars and come dance with a star

Strapped with assault rifles pointed at my rivals
My elevator goin' straight to the top, nigga I won't stop

Sean Jean 2-piece smellin' better than Branson
New York Nicks court-side, nigga, AND1
I can stop making the bands, 'cause I am one
New York need me, Cali gave me a star
If you don't believe me; Hollywood boulevard
You can go there
If you ever need the D-I-double D-Y  B-A-D  B-O-Y
Good in any hood, no vest, no .45
Got my man lookin' down on me from Bed-Stuy
Angels all around me flyin' over my lambo
And I never stop burnin' wax like a candle

With a red bone, head redder than Sinbad's

That’s why the R.E.D. album got a Michael Jackson buzz
I mean I should get a red Michael Jackson glove
And grab my dick (HOOOOOOOO!), what’s happening blood?

Well you kinda heard me speaking
""You ain't a crip like Snoop, you ain't a blood like Game""
And I was speaking on Game without knowing him
But now, you know alot of these dudes jump in the game
And they rap artists, and that's exactly what they is
But they not what they say they are when they rap it

Everybody wanna be the king of the south when
They ain't runnin the damn thing with they mouth
No doubt, it's all good, y'all just stay in y'all opinions
But in the South and in the hood it's understood without saying
It's a given, and it ain't cause what I'm doin for a livin'
It's more because of what I'm doin how I'm livin
Not to mention when I'm rappin, I'm just hurtin niggas feelings
And still chillin on somethin that's into healing
Man, permissions from the Click to continue to keep it pimpin'
But while the crack was in the house, the record sale went thru the ceiling
So say what you want, and do what you please
But for fun I shoot 22's from your shoes to your knees
I run a record label and a crew of G's
So niggas'll come and look for you if you sneeze
Or even breathe the wrong way
You better do what the song say and be easy, else it'll be a long day

I'm a king - bank rolls in the pockets of my jeans
I'm a king - you pussy niggas couldn't see me in your dreams
I'm a king - top topic of all of your magazines
I'm a king - head of the body, leader of the team
I'm a king - remember I can get your block knocked off
I'm a king - a Bentley coupé with the top chopped off
I'm a king - I'm connectin nationwide but in the South
I'm a king - just respect it and keep my name out'cha mouth
I'M A KING

Everybody wanna be the King of the West
But, they ain't runnin the damn thing in the West
That's to bad, it's all good, they just speakin they minds
Stand on top of the Hollywood sign, you can see that it's mine
I'd rather die, motherfucker, than give up my throne
My crown is a Dodger fitted, California's my home
And it's known when the drama pop off, I bring the chrome
So nigga leave me alone, 'fore I start living my songs
I made a killin drug dealin, some people say I'm a villain
Went from choppin' in the house, to the top of rap gettin millions
So watch your mouth, unless you ready to bleed
Cause to me, murderin wack mc's is somethin like a disease
Top down in the Impala, so I can ride in the breeze
And where I'm from, niggas throwin up B's and C's
So make a turn the wrong way, think about what the song say
And be easy, else it'll be a long day

I'm a king - bank rolls in the pockets of my jeans
I'm a king - you pussy niggas couldn't see me in your dreams
I'm a king - top topic of all of your magazines
I'm a king - head of the body, leader of the team
I'm a king - remember I can get your block knocked off
I'm a king - impala with the top knocked off
I'm a king - I'm connectin nationwide but in the West
I'm a king - disrespect it I hit your brains with the tech
I'M A KING

I'm a king - you pussy niggas couldn't see me in your dreams
I'm a king - top topic of all of your magazines
I'm a king - head of the body, leader of the team
I'm a king - remember I can get your block knocked off
I'm a king - a Bentley coupe with the top chopped off
I'm a king - I'm connectin nationwide but in the West
I'm a king - just respect it and keep my name out'cha mouth

Here We Go Again,Ghost Unit,UnKnown,"Guess who's bizack
Wit an ounce of crizack
Or a black mizak fitted to the bizak
L.A. Dodgers kid's at
That's where my shit's at
Niggas want my life homey come get that
I'm tired of the rif-rat
Niggas better sit back
Cause when the guns come out they break like kit-kats
But if its beef break me of a piece
I eat that beat that I'm back on the streets
I got a whole lot of bitches to see
And I don't fuck any dub niggas bitches to me
And a bitch is a bitch thats just a simple fact
Next time I'm in town you gonna get me jacked
Send the baby daddy see how the kids react
When the daddy comes home and his ribs is cracked
And he files a lawsuit for a million flat
Fuck it I gotta deal wit that
That's just how it is

Dre ridin' again
Westside again
Go get your ties again

Half the world wanna see me flow
The other half wanna see me go
It won't happen muthafuckas
Dre still rappin muthafuckas
The streets still love him
Paid in full since ""Deep Cover""
All three speakers still drumming
Beats still coming
Comptons version of ""Feel Drumming""
Same Dre different strokes
Same six-tre different spokes
Same chronic just different smoke

It's been six months too long
Aftermath gotta move on
Now the beef wit me and 50 Cent gone
I told y'all not to fuck wit me
Ghost writer my pens got that murda inc
I feel kinda bad about murdaring Ja
What goes around comes around look at 50's shot (a'ight a'ight)
But fuck that nevermind that shit you did
You tryin' to sell albums I'm just tryin' to feed my kid
Game you gonna respond to mister potatohead
I told I'm just tryin' to feed my kid
Why scoop to a level that requires a shovel
That's like throwing ice cubes at the muthafuckin' devil
I left the group cause the group's too crowded
Now watch game finish his second album without him

Fire In Ya Eyes,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Love is as well gone
As sunny sunny days

Yeah I'm addicted to slugs
I can tell by your pearl handle you know how to treat a thug
I see the fire in ya eyes every time we hug
And I know sometimes you just wanna be rubbed, I'm in..


Yeah!
I know you don't like the word mami
But you my bitch. That's how it is..
Hey
I see the fire in ya eyes half evil half sexy I
Love to take it down every night if ya let me I admit
Baby girl I have my eyes on you
Hopin that one day I can flip the pies on you
Since you down south show you what that rock could do
Come back rich, yeah nigga that's my proof
I, hold the gauge you can hold the twenty-two
Nigga run up on Ya Boy baby you be shootin' too
Fuck Bonnie and Clyde mama, we much deeper
Ya Boy love dough and you the toppings on my pizza
The heater to my ether, my beautiful senorita
And I knew you was my bitch from the first, moment I seized ya
And just like, every blunt needs some green
Every gun needs a beam, every thug needs a queen
She suckin me up, I be sippin the bub
Had to pinch myself, nigga, I think I'm in.. I'm in..


Shit.. Fuck.. That's how it go..
Lemme show ya man.. ?? .. That's my bitch man
First time I held her, the first time I banged her
First time I made her bust, first time I aimed her
Me and her the oh six (06) Bonnie and Clyde
And I call her Nino Wesson when there's drama she ride (ah ha)
And it's gutter hell, it's just me and my bitch
Like Ready to Die, track number twelve
Yea that's wifey: sexy, chrome and black complexion
Got me gettin erection
She chill on my hip, when I play the strip wit her
Show her how much I love her when I stick my clip in her
I get chips and dip with her
Then the shit'll get ugly if I'm doin ? wit her
Menage a toi, double the action
Real street niggas know I be double the slappin
And to my main squeeze, believe me
The Fire in ya eyes, will have me squeeze on a man easy


Night after night..
Lookin through that glass window wishin you was mine
Wishin I could hold you..
Just wanna squeeze the life outta you..
I remember in '96 when we met, you got the best of me
I had an appetite for destruction, you had the recipe
Told me the last motherfucker chose his destiny
One in the head, execution style, so I'm guessin
He ain't know you was special, misused you and abused you
Put his hand around your neck, squeezed harder when you refused
To open your mouth, give him everything you got
I see the fire in ya eyes and in a nigga the shot
I guess what I'm tryin to say is that I like you a lot
You let me hold you like he hold you we take over the block
Go from the dope spot to the CL drop
You like it I love it, now me and you callin the shots
Remember yesterday when we robbed the Candy Shop?
You told me you wished you could've been there when Pac got knocked
Tonight we goin to the range, that'll get you hot
Wear your pretty dress, the one with the infrared dots
I'm in..",https://genius.com/The-game-fire-in-ya-eyes-lyrics
Lost,Purp & Patron: The Hangover,2011.0,"Sometimes I have fucked up dreams
Wake up in cold sweats, can’t sleep
Hit the kitchen for some Moet
I get drunk, but I ain’t never smoke no wet
Been on tour 3 months and I ain't had no sex
Been meditating, exercising my mental bowflex
Michael Jackson dead, which one of us ’bout to go next
Me, Mary J, Robin Thicke or Britney Spears
Nigga I ain’t afraid to die, tell the devil I’m right here
Ho, I can take the strings out of these Nike airs
Tie it round the ceiling fan and end it right here
Kick the ladder cause I climbed that twice
Hate it or love it, I’m one blood nigga, it’s my life
And I can die if I want to, and mama you can cry if you want to
Just tell my sons the truth and as the maggots eat away at my flesh
Let this iced out cross, walk through the bones in my chest

I can try my way (I’m lost)
I can’t find my way (lost)
I can’t find my way (I’m lost)
I can’t find my way (lost)
I can’t find way…

If I tell you a story you gotta keep it between us
Only other niggas that know are Spliff Star and Buss
I call Buss when I need a shoulder
And I don’t always listen so he call me back and say “I told you”
But anyway, my pops is a 
Pedophile, how you stick your 28 year old dick in your child
And now how it feel to be 52 and have a son that’s a millionaire, and he don’t fuck with you, daddy!
She was only in the sixth grade, the day I heard her scream, I should have hit you with the switch blade
Then she ran but I ain’t know which way, she ended up in Vegas doing everything her pimp say
I’ve seen her one Christmas with a black eye, I took her to the store and bought her shades with my last five
My little sister is a prostitute, and I’ma tell you what I’m about to do
Go get her cause she… (lost)


That's all I’m thinking on this Greyhound
Usually I’ll be in this seat with bricks and a tre pound
But this time I'm riding for family
Like Khaled did for Ross, they hold it down in Miami
On my way to Michigan, not to see D12
I’m knocking on every door, “have you seen this female?”
Here’s a picture of my pretty baby sister
Here go one when she was ten and this one our last Christmas
Low light skinned girl, long curly black hair, sorry for wasting time, I know you probably don’t care
Feel like I walked longer than just 8 miles
Ran into a boarded up BMF safe house
Made me think about all the time I spent with Meech makin’ it rain in
 Magic City
When life was a Georgia peach
Now life is a rotten apple
Run faster than New York
You see my sister call me ‘cause life is too short to get (lost)",https://genius.com/The-game-lost-lyrics

16 in the Glock extendos for the tussle

When the last time you’ve been to church (nigga we don’t trust you)
Like the bands front line (nigga we'll rush you)
Laughing over your body, we the one you look up to

Worldstar knock-out king (time to knuckle up)
We ride from California, nigga so buckle up

Dead bodies everywhere (corners bring the shuttle bus)
Niggas gotta fuck with us (if not we fuck you up)
Bitches can get it too, bus driver with the upper cut

Drama with the four of us (I'll make you niggas organed up)

And now that I got everbodys fucking attention
Let's address this bitch ass nigga going at Kendrick
Say the album is trash, nigga you full of gas
Poke holes in you, let you fill up a New York cab
Nigga in belize, cause he all in to his feelings
Cause he did 10 years for shooting at the ceiling
Diddy gave you a mill, lil nigga shoulda chill
Cute curly sideburns, talking 'bout he's real
Check my resume, any nigga that want it I bury them
But fuck this nigga he can't get in to America
I'm 'bout to hit Brooklyn, fuck this bitch Erykah
Bust a nut, call a cab and cut
After I tear it up, and we just met today
Gave her the pole, the day after electionday
Bitch was on Section 8, tryna get a Section 8
Already came, it's a wrap like electric tape
And Hurricane said he got this bitch, light out
She fell a sleep then her girl got piped out
And theese the type hoes NBA niggas wife out
And theese my side bitches nigga what's your life 'bout?
Mine's about guns in the stash, the chrys piped out
That's a 300c and chrys iced out
3 kids, all 3 closets niked out
And I'm bipolar, see 40 Glocc, lights out!

I'm goin', goin'

We stack Bentleys, drive fast cars
And fuck with multiple minages

How could you blame us?

They mad cause I'm more famous than Amos, right?
Taking cookies from these rookies could be dangerous, right?
Salute your motherfucking city of them Angels, right!
That entertain the life, that ain't the life that we livin'
Most of my niggas is better off in prison
Wishin', missing
They fuckin' kids, man, they fuckin' wife, man
The double meaning only caught up with that white man
Turn off the lights, man, put up the lights, man

The paper real basic, like the birds that get flown in
California hotties, like furniture in my lobby
Where I'm from, don't you know? Nigga, drinkin' ain't a hobby
I'm bi-coastal, nigga don't make me go postal
You know I keep the Glock 9 comfy in my holster
I'm supposed to ride roasters
Sip bottles on Louis coasters
Feed bitch niggas to the vultures
What, you mad cause I'm back with the doc?
Money, alongside the yacht
Diamonds inside of my watch, ballin'
We all live playin' poker with this rap shit
Game time chips on the table, you know how I get
Hundred thousand Benz
Million dollar checks

Whenever you touchdown in Cali, be prepared

Put your life on the line
Put your life on the line
Put your life on the line

You know where to find me

Don't get it twisted

2Pac wouldn't been shit without his mama
Obama wouldn't be shit without his mama, and his baby mama
See my mama set me down when I was 12
She told me I was heaven while I always gave her hell
No role models, daddy in and out of jail
Caught up in the system where they trap us black males
Sippin' Henny as the world turn, close my eyes, see my mama face and
Know she always kept me straight just like them braces
And even still, you gon' always will my black queen mama
Cause you never been no crack fiend mama
And even though you only son grew up to be a thug
You ain't never stopped showin' me love

When we was little ass kids, fall in the dirt
You call your mama now you grown 'bout to get murked
Screamin' for your mama when it's on, funeral home
There go your mama wish you brought your ass home and left the drama alone
I had my mama waitin' by that window
Comin' home 3 in the morning, smellin' like indo
And even though we had some long nights we was friends though
Got my name from yo mama playin' Nintendo, you kicked me out
But you gon' always be my black queen mama
I bought your house servin' crack fiends mama
And even though you only son grew up to be a thug
You ain't never stopped showin' me love

And even if that man leave, that mama stayin' strong
You know mama's baby, daddy's maybe, streets raise me
Granny save me, sweet Satan, what a lady
She carry you for 9 months
She got a baby in her stomach, she ain't cry once
You gon' always need your mama never loud front
When she get older, turn that favor when that time comes
And always remember she was there so we never needed health care
Too much pride so we ain't never been on welfare
And mama, before we leave this earth
My only wish is that I beat you to the dirt cause I know

Cincinnati Red fitted snug on my motherfucking forehead. Nike backpack on, you know like Durant be wearing. Nike straps tighter than a virgin pussy Illmatic in the Walkman, what?
Sitting on the subway they looking like ""who is that?""
The boy gutter all hood New York sewer rat
You can never mace me, where Cuda at?
They love me out in Harlem like a ten dollar buddha sack
I spit that Ill Street Blues, yeah Kool G Rap
But my style is big, where the Coogis at?
I said my style is Big now light a L
As I skip to the next track on Supreme Clientele
Ghost to Manhattan, seat reclined in the Aston
Tom Ford glasses cause NY is into fashion
Madison. Square. Garden. Feeling like Spike Lee's squares, Jordans
You squares ain't important
Fresh to death my gear's in a coffin

Blowing that sour diesel I ain't be here that often
Riding on the A train, listening to Ghostface
I'm just ridin on the A train, listenin to Ghostface
Riding on the A train, listening to Ghostface
I'm just riding on the A train, listening to Ghostface
Pull up in that Derrick Rose hop out number nines or elevens
You niggas is copycats, my style is patent leather
South side of the Chi nigga I ain't packing never
I ain't shy of the Chi, Jay Cutler in cold weather
And all I do is win, 72 and 10
Ball like Mike, Scottie, Dennis Rodman and them
7-4 Chevelle, niggas riding in them
Killers from Cabrini-Green, I was riding with them
Pelle jackets niggas out here robbing in them
And even getting coat-jacked ain't Common to him
Keep thinking you Larry Hoover that line'll have you shook
That's that Crack Music nigga forgot I was on the hook
G.D.s, Vice Lords, Four Corner Hustlers
Latin Kings, MCs, all em will fuck with us
Blowing trees like the windy city
Nigga I blow trees in the Windy City
Riding on the L train, listening to Kanye
I'm just riding on the L train, listening to Kanye
I'm just riding in on the L train, listening to Kanye
Said I'm riding on the L train, listening to Kanye
I be in Lil Haiti
First forty eighty
Ain't nothing bout to go down nigga my fam's Zoe Pound
And ever since they locked my nigga Zo down
Everything slow down, but my nigga Ross is on
The homie Khaled put the Boss's on
We blowing orange like the Dolphins home
And we don't floss the chrome
We turn that Wildcat offense on
That New Era fly off ya dome
I'm about to take my talents to South Beach
I don't even go to the games, but got Heat
Ain't no Trickin Daddy, I take a bitch to get some Cuban food
Have a couple mojitos then fuck her like a Cuban do
Riding down Collins in the newest coup
Flo-Rida on the place, they think I'm Uncle Luke
Nigga Tony Montana, who the fuck is you?
I'm the all-red side of the Rubik's Cube

Perignon in my glasses, toast to competition

See the lambos out front, that tells you we fuckin' models

My niggas pop up outta nowhere, State Farm
But I'm cool, and Orator play them Drake songs
And bring it back to the west side, play them Nate songs
Cause little mama know, we’re only in here for one night
A week though,
 and watch out for them wolves
Dressed up in them sheep clothes
And she don’t really club, but I bet that ass a freak though

We’re only in here for one night (a week though)
We’re only in here for one night (I said a week though)
One shot of Goose, one shot of 'tron
One shot of Goose, one shot of 'tron

Round of applause, baby make that ass clap
You know your man he a fraud, I gotta have that
She want a bodyguard, I'll be her New Edition
She pray for Louboutins, must be her True Religion
Now I'm lookin' for Taraji and somebody with a body like Chyna
Chyna? The one from King of Diamonds who designed her
I call her Barbie, pink Ferraris on her birthday
And I'mma make sure every day is like the first day
She want another round, fuck her to another round
I don't just beat the pussy, I runs it to the ground
Every day another girl and another town
I don't just beat the pussy, I runs it to the ground

We’re only in here for one night (a week though)
We’re only in here for one night (I said a week though)
One shot of Goose, one shot of 'tron
One shot of Goose, one shot of 'tron

Sunday night, Grey Stone, neck full of gray stones
Staring at the crowd, trying to see who I’ma take home
Game said ""straight 'tron,"" I be on that champagne
Bitches all around us, trying to watch us do the damn thang
Shouts out to Joey Crack, chicks like, ""oh he back""
Welcome to my house party, OG, roll it back
Blow it if he showin' that, keep a few loaded gats
Bitch niggas showin' out, real niggas notice that
California lifestyle, fuckin' with my nigga Chuck
?, Young Chris, nigga what, all we know is get to it
Stack high live it up, fuckin' with that Grey Stone
Everybody get 'em up, yeah

We’re only in here for one night (a week though)

Your first topic is
""The black mamba Kobe Bryant""
Kobe Bryant
When I be rockin' my Kobe's I'll be in, um

I'll be in a red Rolls, white ceilin'
No body, no casket, just blood spillin'
I ain't a new President but I love killin'
They like, “Game, where ya been?”
Blood chillin'
But not on no islands and villa
I’ve been lost in Compton with some drug dealers, uh
I bought the Relapse, loved it, hit the block, hugged it
Kobe still makin' crack, the new Kobe shoes-ism
But I ain't seen 'em in years
Still survive like niggas threw me off the first tier
Still the most gutta, spit the most butta
Them shoes got more game than niggas at the Rucker
There he is
Second topic

About my life inside the strip club

Waitin' for the girl to come out who look clearer then water
That's somebody's daughter, don't know how I feel about it, uh

All Doggs Go to Heaven,UnKnown,2011.0,"Rolling up a Swisher banging Nate Dogg
Pulling on this 8-ball contemplating suicide
Hold up
Tears in my eyes, sipping on this Goose getting loose
I don’t know what else to do so I’m sitting here
Rolling up a Swisher banging Nate Dogg
Pulling on this 8-ball contemplating suicide
Hold up
Tryna smoke the pain away
Hand on the desert
All dogs go to heaven
Til then smoke weed everyday

Aftermath studio, 2005
It was live, it was Snoop, it was Nate, it was I
It was Dre, it was Daz and Kurupt we was high
One of my favorite memories
Them niggas like kin to me
When they move, I move we like a centipede
Back when Dre was in his drop like Kennedy
I was banging Regulate round the hood regulating
In and out of county jail when crips and bloods were segregating
And just like y’all, I used to love Tha Dogg Pound
Ten years later we here laying Nate Dogg down
Damn he was only forty one so I’mma get high and just drink til this forty done
But I really wanna cry
Shit I really wonder why good niggas gotta die
If we living under God
Maybe he living in the sky and I couldn’t bring him back if I tried
So we just


All-Star Weekend
I seen Warren G with no Nate Dogg
That's like MJG with no 8-Ball
I don’t wanna see that R.I.P tatt
LBCPT that, we that Coast where the DPG at
Eazy-E that, tell me where the weed at
You see that all red P hat
Where Pac used to eat at
Hoes in different area codes better believe that
Can you believe this where they killed BIG at
Now he at where N-A-T-E D O double G at
Cause that’s where all dogs go because of you we all blow
Now when I need a hook
Who I’m gonna call for
I sample your old shit
I don’t know these new niggas
Bout to roll an ounce of this kush
I need a few swishas
And the game will never be the same without him
I’m just mad he ain't here to hop on the R.E.D album


I’m in the crib, Dre beats on banging Lay Low
Kush to the dome, stacking kills on his halo
Tryna get my mind what it is but it is what it is
Everybody raise your lighters when I say so
Shed tears, that's for Nate, bro
Cali will never be the same, Cube and Dre know
I hold the West Coast down, thats why he signed me
And Nate came with hooks better than Kareem and Ali
I’m blowing smoke up in the wind
Kinda hard to concentrate when you sitting here focused on the end
Today a child is born, tomorrow he’s a man
Next day he gone
Life cycle repeats itself again and again
Uncles, cousins and friends
No-one escapes death or drives to heaven in a Benz
But one things for sure, everybody gotta go
When it’s my turn I hope I never know",https://genius.com/The-game-all-doggs-go-to-heaven-lyrics

I thought all that beefin was over man
Squashed it man, been there done that
Somebody had to gon' on and fuck it up

No more Bleek and Buddens I was hopin' for silence
Till the little sleeping beauty, went and woke the giant
This little bitch from The Luniz wants beef, he's lying
So I called E-40, and tried to seize the violence
I got niggas on the island, for puttin' in stainless work
With vaseline on they palms, gettin' ready to Bang Em Smurf (you little bitch)
I here him screamin' in Compton, sound like my bitch cummin'
You wasn't never fuckin' with G-Unit, quit frontin'
For Domination be Lisa Leslie, a big woman
With a nine on the back, I'm gonna catch that bitch runnin'
Shove a .40 in his throat, now nigga spit somethin'
And get lost boy, go visit your big cousin
I got fish to fry, throw a line in the pacific
With cocaine on the hook, for this Luniz ass nigga
You a bitch, how you call your self the Ice Cream Man
When Master P took your name and your ice cream van
Made 500 million, that's your homey though
Took your man hood, gave your shit to Lil'Romeo
This nigga, 5 foot 2, talkin' that big shit
You Got 5 On It? that money went to Chris Hicks
Tryin' to diss Too $hort for doin' his pimp shit
Nigga you been gitten fucked, swallowin' big dicks
Pac knew he was a pussy, that's why he ran south
Signed to Rap-A-Lot, they never put his ass out
Hid behind Lil' J, all the sudden you thugged out
Ran back to the Bay, sleepin' on wannabe cuz couch
How you drop 5 albums, don't own one house
Or get the boss to call me, Banks, and Buck out
It's G-Unit bitch, let me show you what blood bout
When my blood pressure rise, I bring the bloods out
Put the barrell on his neck, blow his guts out (*gunshot)
Now that's whats you call a Yukmouth

Yeah, you little faggot ass bitch
Yeah nigga, on the motherfuckin' internet with that faggot ass footage nigga
You little bitch ass nigga, Domination, nigga

Nigga you ain't say shit nigga
""That ain't me man, that was C-Bo, man, this Regime, this Regime, man, Bay area, Bay area""

And when I catch you nigga, you gonna need Dr. Dre to get my motherfuckin' G-6 out you ass

Spark one for the homies, they dead and gone, but I

Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no
They dead and gone, but I

Lil Frogg, nigga, I miss you
Your momma still wish she could kiss you
I talked to all the homies, yeah, all the homies
Swear that day we wish that we was with you
I remember when I first rolled up
Seen you laid out there on Rosecrans
It was Cedar Block and if you read about us
We was throwing that shit up with both hands
Make me wanna hop back in that old van
Take an Olde E and sip the whole can
But I'm out here, with your brother and your pops
All night, my nigga, I ain't got no plans
Your mom's out here having a fit
Big Frogg and the truck niggas sick
All the homies on the block getting lit
Putting everything they can into a clip
Yeah, to the street, it wasn't even Crips
Some of the homies trying to blame a bitch
Cause he was riding on sky today, he died
Wrong place, wrong time, nigga fucked up shit
But your funeral ain't nothing but love
Look around, it ain't nothing but Bloods
And let me tell you what a bitch nigga did
Took a good daddy away from seven kids

Still riding around through the city looking for an enemy
Still riding around through the city thinkin' 'bout all the memories
Thinking back like God damn
All them niggas really really livin me
Wishing I knew what I knew now
Half them niggas wouldn't have been next to me
Nowadays, ain't too many niggas next to me
None of these bitches getting next me
I seen what it did to a good friend
That was God trying to lecture me
That was God trying open me
That's when God got close to me
I went through the fire, went through the pain
Now it's all hope for me
Now it's designer, in the ghost that they chauffeur me
My haters is mad, oh you know, they didn't go for me
They wish I was gone, they wish in the song somebody wrote for me
But I got the GOAT in me, I got the truth in me

Said I wake up in the morning
Spark one for the homies, they dead and gone, but I
But I'm never ever lonely

You show me love wherever I go
One thing I know is
I'm getting dough, I'm on
Got them hoes coming, let's go
Shawty say I'm a pimp well I guess so
One thing I know is
I'm getting dough, I'm on

You niggas know who I is, what kind of car I drive
Killa California, the door's commiting suicide
Bitches ain't fucking with you unless you in the newest ride
You know me, 5 star nigga, do or die
I'm from the home of the scandalists
East west north south, niggas get lost in Los Angeles
We got the baddest bitches on the north campus
Nigga hopping off the transit, straight up inside a phantom
Stop at the liquor store, get a swisher hit the door
Then hit the hood, ay blood what they hitting for
Whole hood tatted up, bandana right side jeans coming out
Busters leave when it's nighttime
15s in the trunk hit me 'fore they see me come
Red 24s no need to ask where I'm from
Westside home of the purp even 12 year olds put in work
West coast got 'em bangin'


31 still banged out shots let 'em rank out
Walk through any crip or blood hood with his chain out
Grandmomma stay on the shore in the same house
Be on the porch, Dre Beats on with my thang out
That ain't a threat but little do you forget
I was 20 years old rolling up on nigga's sets
Coming straight up out the jets, impala sitting wet
Try me in 'em high lows coming up out the tech
Now I'm getting money big Snoop on the texts
Andre Young on the bottom of my check
Fresh from the fade to the bottom of my checks
Matter of fact Chucks, Red cadillac trucks
Panamera red 4's peanut butter guts
On my Pau Gasol shit hit the block and post up
Then gather the crew hit childs and toast up
Hoes breaking their neck tryna see me close up


10 million albums sold, I ain't gotta brag
Disrespect my girl or my kids and get a bodybag
Ak47 with the sawdy rag, niggas better duck cause it ain't a paparazzi flash
2011 game banging, y'all copycats
How you throwing a stocking cap and they ain't never cocked it back
Nigga copy that, capiche nigga
Extended clip got 1 bullet for each nigga
Ask nice and I might let you eat nigga
Let you smoke, I keep kush in the pete swisher
Keep the blunts rolled up, phantom 24'ed up
Hop out knockout whole chest froze up
I be in the back of the club looking like so what
20 bottles 40 grand pro'ly why she chose us
Now she in the Beverly Center with her nose up

Blades spinning like a nigga head when I took my first hit-hit-hit
Banging that Above the Rim soundtrack, wishing Pac was here can't go back

Keep a nigga fucking bad hoes in the bathroom at the club off that

Cooling in my cup mixed with Codeine
And I ball like I'm on a pro team
And her pussy give me protein
Next time you knockin on the window
And I'm blazing my endo
And you try to give me your demo
I swear God I'll listen if you tell a nigga

Just trying to get me a knot
Different way till you get paid mane'
Keep ho's running up the spot
On my way I seen me a chick
God damn she look so hot
So I hop out the whip
Had ta-had ta give her what I got
I said ""Excuse me miss tell me your name
Maybe later we hang and then you give me brain""
I explained don't complain, I'm no lame, I'm with Game
Don't back off this ""Blackwall"" can't you read on my... chain?
Got a got a couple spots we can hang on the low
I didn't even know the chick stripped
Watch her get down to the floor
Came over right around 3, and she left right around 4
That's enough about my bitches...
All I really wanna know...

I stay shining like Christmas lights
Shirt off blowing krpytonite
Which ones want to spend the night?
Red room tour G4 flights
Sitting in my maro, watching Roberto De Niro
When he seen a freak, I'm a deep straight hard as an arrow
Dark tint cruising through the city
Bitch walking sitting on 20's
Searching for my hush, seat empty
If it's money I got plenty
Famous Fresh I run my city
Bitches say I run my city
I don't know Diddy, I smoke Phillys
Run base like a nigga from the Phillies
What nigga pussy taste like?
Probably grape like my swisher
But I can't hit a couple girls
Might cut us both up like scissors
Tell a nigga stunt act silly
Hit em with the black Mac milly
But before I smoke you just answer one thing...

What your baby momma pussy taste like?
Just like cherry kool-aid
What your baby momma pussy taste like?
Just like cherry kool-aid

Niggas keep saying that they run this town
They don't run this town, nigga I run this town
Niggas keep playing when we come around
Yeah I run 'em down, they wanted now
Niggas keep saying that they run this town
They don't run this town, nigga I run this town
Niggas keep playing, I hunt 'em down
Gun 'em down, get a hundred rounds from me

Niggas better break bread and niggas better play dead
I step in front of the beam and take it off of Dre head
Everything's straight red: my bitch, my car, the tip of my cigar
My Philly hat, my scarf
Y'all niggas pushing light weight
Bryon Russell ass niggas falling down, tryna put a hand up in Mike face
The fucking booth is in danger, ain't a mic safe
Mike Bibby, Mike Vick, nigga, Mike Jake
4th album, cause I do my shit the right way
And like Dre the fans gon wait, so have a nice day
I'mma have a nice bitch sitting in the white 6
Coldest rapper alive: I write with a ice pick
And I write sick, meaning that my bars ill
Fuck the world up, nigga, I'm a oil spill
In the 4-wheel, paint job orange peel
Not like Picasso bitch, but I draw steel

Niggas keep saying that they run this town
They don't run this town, nigga I run this town
Niggas keep playing when we come around
Yeah I run 'em down, they wanted now
Niggas keep saying that they run this town
They don't run this town, nigga I run this town
Niggas keep playing, I hunt 'em down
Gun 'em down, get a hundred rounds from me

I ain't never gave no fuck, why would I start now?
Everytime I get on the track, it's black hawk down
I declare war, pullin' niggas' cards now
And I ain't gotta fuck Sarah Palin to lay the law down
Birds: knock em all down, you could push record now
Used to ball like Chris Paul, I'm John Wall now
Still bang Dogg Pound, I don't like how y'all sound
Gun-butt a nigga in the grill, try to floss now
I set the bridge on fire, try to cross now
Still fuck Benzino, I don't care who run The Source now
I got magazines inside of magazines
Walk up, laid everybody on the porch down
Kill the drums cuz the track is a corpse now
Spread my fingers when I shoot, Kyle Watson, Georgetown
Think it's a movie then its A.I, Georgetown
But if it ain't a court 'round, I'm bustin' with the 4 pound

Niggas keep saying that they run this town
They don't run this town, nigga I run this town
Niggas keep playing when we come around
Yeah I run 'em down, they wanted now
Niggas keep saying that they run this town
They don't run this town, nigga I run this town
Niggas keep playing, I hunt 'em down

Through My Eyes,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Life ain't fair and sometimes it get black
Like the Nike Airs
 
and that's when I go back
Back where? to the block
 where the dreams never stop
'Cause its hard to dream when your dream was being on top
And you already there..
so you look down into the City and see
Life ain't what it used to be
Kids fantasize about how a Phantom rides
If you attract a star then welcome to the enterprise
Hop in a spaceship and fly..fly away
Pass the clouds where Marvin Gaye and 2Pac stay
And never wanna come back like Jam Master Jay
Matter fact, close your eyes and just pass away

If you could see straight through my eyes
If I left this world tomorrow and say goodbye
If you could take one thing with you what would it be
Oh, If you, could be, with me

You wouldn't be hearin' this if it wasn't for Lupe
He inspired what I wrote bought his album today
Then I threw it in my car and let the CD play
You are a Superstar is what the CD say
And on the eve of this morning I'm like Stevie J
Making love to the music like when Stevie play
When I rap the 'hood listen, ghetto T.D. Jakes
And the Devil tried hard just to see me break
That's when I switch switch cars and I cross my heart
Knowing that I'm God's Son like the belly of Nas
I used to dream hard about being in Belly with Nas
Even the ghetto Mozart couldn't play that part
Like the Eli Manning's when they play that hard
Everybody ain't a Giant but they play that card
And that card is dealt and then blows are felt
:ike a Mayweather jab that lands below the belt
Yeah

If you could see straight through my eyes
If I left this world tomorrow and say goodbye
If you could take one thing with you what would it be
Oh, If you, could be, with me

Light a candle in the dark and lead yourself to the light
And when you there blow it out so you can sleep through the night
The Sun rise in the morning and your future get bright
Bright as the ice in my ear it's like a movie premiere
And you can be Denzel here's your Oscar tip
If you can memorize your lines without reading the script
Then you can walk through the forest while you standin' still
You might get lucky like Forrest 20 million a film
And with that, you can buy yourself a football field
Build a field of dreams for kids who got that skill
Marry a legend like Jada did if you got that Will
But laugh now cry later if you pop that pill
Seemed fun for a moment but it's not that real
'Cause your life is ice cold and you got that chill
So tomorrow when wake and you spin that wheel
Just remember what I told you from on top that hill
Its real

If you could see straight through my eyes
If I left this world tomorrow and say goodbye
If you could take one thing with you what would it be
Oh, If you, could be, with me",https://genius.com/The-game-through-my-eyes-lyrics

These niggas had a chance, now their shit is over

Don't be mad at me cause I kept it rollin'
It's my turn, my turn, my turn, my turn. (HAHA!)
24 low on hearts on that '06 rose
It's my turn, my turn, my turn, my turn. (The Doctor's Advocate)
Let the sun roof back and I keep on coastin’
It's my turn, my turn, my turn, my turn
I can hear niggas talking, whispering in the dark they're like dogs with no bark
When I pull over and park then guns starts to spark and the bullets find the mark
Niggas outlined in the chalk and I speak from the heart
When I say I killed you, it's simple and plain
Don't say shit about Dre and don't mention The Game
This industry is fake and I can't understand how a grown ass man
Sent a bitch to the pen, how you snitched on stan; he's a bitch like his man
He'd of did you for a grand
. Eminem called him stan
I'm going to say it again
If I had one more chance I would've break all of his ribs with my bare fuckin' hands
I'm a gangsta on fire
You ain't, you a liar
You ain't got no pride, 
there's a snitch in the wire
Your fan base knows that you're gangsta is dying
I won't stop until that wanksta retires
I'm gone

It's my turn, my turn, my turn, my turn
These rap niggas hate and they smile in my face
You rabbit niggas mad, cause the turtle won the race
And, the radio debate what the fuck they going to play
All the hot shit is my shit; they take what I say
Play Scrabble with my words and put it on the front page
They go find a picture of 50 and Game
Say it's East vs. West; New York and L.A
Since I dont' button up, now I'm beefin' with Jay
Apologize in seconds
You niggas is reckless, you're not going to pay me to beef with a legend
My pride I'd protecting, the streets I'm respecting
I'm not trying to replace Pac so accept
After 5 million records; the Dr.Dre lectures; and 3 world tours
West Coast Resurrected
My form to the group of help was rejected
I felt abandoned so I threw away my necklace
These niggas had a chance, now their shit is over
It's my turn, my turn, my turn, my turn
Don't be mad at me cause I kept it rollin'
It's my turn, my turn, my turn, my turn
24 low on hearts on that '06 rose
It's my turn, my turn, my turn, my turn
Let the sun roof back and I keep on coastin'
It's my turn, my turn, my turn, my turn
After 20 magazines and a couple of awards
I can close my first chapter; put my plaques on the wall
To the top of the billboard
Who ever knew that I would sell more than Destiny Child and U2?
Or do a song with Busta,
 go neck and neck with Usher?
Went gold in a week, I'm a bad mutherfucka
This Gangsta Disciple and Vice Lord shit
Brown pride, Latin King
This is Blood, this is Crip
Hit the Impala switch
I keep a clip for any nigga that said I fuck his bitch
Or changed cause I'm rich, saying Game used to strip
Niggas weren't saying shit until I came with a hit
Now you want to see me dead, blood stains in his whip
Take a father from his son, put my name in cement
After I'm gone they're sample my songs
You can bury my bones but my music lives on
These niggas had a chance, now their shit is over
It's my turn, my turn, my turn, my turn
Don't be mad at me cause I kept it rollin'
It's my turn, my turn, my turn, my turn

It's my turn, my turn, my turn, my turn
Aye yo, man, I don't really give a fuck about all that shit ya'll doing, that shit ain't making no noise. I'm saying that shit is bullshit. Man, why you niggas trying fucking kill my mutherfucka career? Man, Shit! It ain't going to happen, nigga. Not as long as my mutherfucka Bentley got 22 inch low in hearts on it, nigga. Shit!

Get down or lay down, like Bennie Mack told niggas

Black Wall Street behind us - I'm a menace to society

Ride or die til they kill me and put me in thugs mansion

They want me burried so I don't leave with out the Desert Eagle
Shoot first, ask questions on way to country jail
Kill a nigga over my chain, cause I know I'mma make bail

If I die tonight - bury me a G amongst rap legends
'Cause I spit bullets and rhymes, sixteens and nines
I keep a vest and a weapon, my baby momma got me stressin'
Prayin' on my knees every night, askin' God is there a heaven
So here is my confession to my unborn child
If five shots couldn't drop me but I ain't take 'em and smile
I lost a lot of my niggas to gangbangin' and ditches
One finger on the trigger, dog, I live the life of a sinner
These motherfucker wanna see me doing life in the pen
I'm an Outlaw and the West coast is ridin' again
My competition is none
, I'm on the mission with guns
Starring death in the eyes, 20 niggas deep, when we ride
My enemies is bitches - they plottin on my riches
Can't walk in the street with out paparazzi taking pictures
Label me a made nigga, all the way from Compton to Boston
These niggas keep talkin, I leave 'em dead in the coffin
I'm troublesome

Money over bitches is my motto, in the street I'm known for catchin' hollows
Packin' pistols and drinking Belvy and Grabbles out the bottle
No role models, only killas and fiends
Withness my niggas strapped with gats, and army fatigues
If it's murder, he wrote it, if I'm lying
Let the devil excel quoted and know that I'm strictly a rap poet
Babtized in my own tears, chastised by my own peers
I'm a product of my childhood years
My mother told me I'm hopeless, my pops wasn't around
One of the reasons why I'm clutchin' a pound
California dreaming, chronic smoke out the Beamer
One hand on the nina, got these hoochie bitches screamin'
They know that I'm a celebrity, keep the cop-killers in the clip
And watch my back is what my niggas keep telling me

Yeah, yeah, better heard me in the club
Niggas think that I lost it
Ballin hard on these records, my triangle office
You can ask Battlecat
Who the youngin that be coming to the ref school?
Pharmacy, one of the best spittin on the hood
You can ask Pooh
Just left loose compound
Cuz I'm hanging on the Westside, don't get knocked down
It's cool, I don't do it for the props now
Need help, I just call up the Doc now

I let the impala ass scrape, one blunt in my ashtray
And you can go ask Dre, see what he got to say
About the Chronic, the Chronic
We get money the fast way, give bitches the gassed face
Don't wait 'til the last day, to see who got the deals

Fuck around and jack some, five- no Michael
Hello, a hundred thousand in the mattresses
Im Hollywood, yeah, I only fuck actresses

Im in the Amber Rose rolls with Amber Rose hoes
Sorry Wiz

You can take it as a shot or free promo
But everybody in this motherfucker know I'm loco
Aaron Rogers aim, knock the man off your polo
Used to scare the shit out you niggas with my old flow
Post-documentary, Comptons most wanted
Finish you off like this Corona while I'm yawning
Finish you off like this Corona while I'm yawning
And roll up that OG kush, like motherfucker


Me and Skee been doing this
Y'all had Snoop
I'll put the Piru in this
Look at all these fake ass bloods trying to ruin it
Everything red down to the 'Ye Louis kicks
And who is this?
With the all red crucifix
Navy blue Cardinals fitted, I'm a lunatic
Flow like the uzi spit
Hoppin' out the newest shit
Windows down, disturbin' the peace!
Bitch, I'm Ludacris
Used to be on the block moving rocks from 2 to 6
Jimmy Iovine money

I ain't talkin' Tiffany cause I ain't talkin' industry
I'm talkin' in the streets, twin Bentleys
I'm tryna be with you mentally before physically
Or physically before mentally, just remember me
For you I'd let that thing like a symphony
Sid and Nancy or Mickey and Mallory we meant to be
Never been a trick, I do the shopping for both us
Send shots at these vultures in these Mark Jacob loafers
I'm sayin', you gon' let me see somethin'? Stop playin'
I didn't know it was like that goddamn
You bring the LL out a nigga
The Louis V, the Berkin and Chanel out a nigga
J12 out a nigga, so you know what time it is
I'm 'bout to call the realtor, yo ma, where you tryna live

Pushin' it, your lips
Cause my drug is your kiss
I'm pushin' it, your body
You're beautiful, vaginal
I'm pushin' it, back door
I wanna elevate ya to the top floor
I'm pushin' it, need a rush
The way I'm out on your body, the way your body touch

What's happenin' mommy? What you doin'? You supposed to be
Livin' in the life of luxury so you should go with me
I’m overly excited, spend the night, I bet you like it
Do with it whatever you like , it don't matter, just don't bite it
You see that feeling you had when you met me, we you shouldn't fight it
They said you and I or more than worth a try, so don't deny it
See, I'm King like Leonidas, dress your hands with the brightest
Stones known to man when your man's pockets on a diet
Brought you in this presidential, out that double in the Hyatt
Big money talkin', all broke niggas be quiet
It don't matter how he feels, all that matters how he live
Don't listen to his opinion till he stack a couple mill
But until then feel free to come chill
In my crib in the hills sit back kick off your heels
Said you never seen a pad with a view so ill
Or receive so much pleasure that you couldn't hold still
Well until

Pushin' it, your lips
Cause my drug is your kiss
I'm pushin' it, your body
You're beautiful, vaginal
I'm pushin' it, back door
I wanna elevate ya to the top floor
I'm pushin' it, need a rush
The way I'm out on your body, the way your body touch

Straight to the penthouse, elevate
Let me put my hands on your w-w-wait
Let me take a second, let me take it in
You can run that game all night, but you know I'll w-w-win
I'm superman, I'm super cool
I'm breathin' air all over you
I'm superman, I'm super cool
I'm breathin' air all over you

I let your friends talk bad about you, I didn't kn-izzo
Behind your back callin' you a H to the izzo
I apologize, lay your head on my pillow
Mr. and Mrs. Smith and we can have a little Willow
She can shave the sides, put a couple lines in it
And we can have spritzers put a couple limes in it
Throw a Bar Mitzvah put a couple dimes in it
She go see a Drake show but never out of line with it
So every chance I get, nigga I'm in it
Deep sea divin' tryna see what I can find in it
So it's mine in'it, and that's a Porsche ain't it
So picture that and have Andy Warhol paint it
I'm a rude boy so I'ma go and get it up
Rihanna post Chris, Matt, Kim, baby this is us
So talk to me, have you ever been to Cannes
Yeah, south of France, next stop Japan
Let's go

Pushin' it, your lips
Cause my drug is your kiss
I'm pushin' it, your body

You sell 5 million records, some shit gon' change.""

No ice to black diamonds in my Aftermath chain
You know I'm gonna ride and ain't shit changed
But the right to claim both sides

Ask these, niggas know me down in Bed Stuy
Blowing sticky with them Crooklyn kids

Had my baby mama bust the windows out of my Benz
Hip hop police on me every city I'm in
Well, hell, me and Dre, we dipping again
3 wheel motion, chrome spokes on the rims
Run up on us watch that 38 revolver spin
I'm rich Game bitch, I made a few mill'
Now the '64 Impala got a Paul Wall grill
They say I moved out the hood
I ain't keeping it real
So I took the projects
Put 'em on top of the hill
I'm hungry, still rap like I ain't got no deal
You can pop that Cristal, but nigga I pop steel
I'm going diamond, I put that on my first born child
I'm almost there, I ran 99 miles
Bitches, they used to diss me, they feeling me now
They say I rap like the ol' Snoop
On Doggystyle. Ha ha!


This could be the day you get rich or
This could be the day you try
This could be the day you walk away or
This could be the day you die
Yeah motherfucker, you hear my shit in the club
When you do, 9 out of 10 times, I'm in the club
Stop fucking with Cristal, I can't pay that price
I take twenty 40 ounces and a bucket of ice
Pour it on my niggas, now they flooded with ice
Niggas hate me to my death, cause I'm loving my life
I can walk through any hood, I paid that cost
I ain't felt this good since I got shot in the heart

You can't ball? Then it's probably the haters
Can't breathe then it's probably the Desert, if you a gangsta or not

Murda,Doctor’s Advocate Unreleased Bonus Tracks,UnKnown,"Dre, I see dead people
Murda Murda, leave mine alone
Betta mind your own,(or its)
Murda murda, When the heat is on
Betta ride with chrome(or its)
Murda Murda, If that beam is on
Your life is gone in it
Murda
Let's take a ride in my 64' impala
I'm your California tour guide
Show where the police let BIG die
They call it Los Angeles, I call it suicide!
I took a bullet in the heart and survived
So hit the switch, lean back, and enjoy the ride
Make a right on Green Leaf, but don't look to the side
Them is Kelly Park Crips, they still mad Eazy Died
That Seattle mirror in the hat, Homie that's South Side
Where Serinas sister caught a strait bullet outside
Where they spray paint, baby layin in the street
You know Orlando Anderson from that death row beef
If you ever need some chronic take a trip to long beach
But there ain't no Bloods out there so take out your red strings
Insane and Rollin 20's Crips equal white sheets
Snoop will tell you, when it gets dark in the LBC its
Murda Murda, leave mine alone
Betta mind your own,(or its)
Murda murda, When the heat is on
Betta ride with chrome(or its)
Murda Murda, If that beam is on
Your life is gone in it
Murda
Murda in the CPT
Ask Dre his brother Tyeree got murdered in the street
I lost my brother too back in 93'
Pull over at the next light, let me grab us an O.E
This is Suge knight's hood that's the Compton Swap meet
Them the homies had 2Pac dealin MOB
So we can walk across the street, eat
But I ain't tryin die for no hamburger
And Lueders Park got beef
Out here Bloods kill Bloods, and Crips kill Crips
So Esses sit kick back cuz they ain't got to do shit
When I was young they used to beef with Santana Blocc Crips
They'ed take black and brown pride and put it in a full clip
I know Compton ain't shit, but its home to me
I'm still a B-L-double O-D
When we get to my hood, ill show you how to throw up a P
But put your fucken hands down homie or its gonna be another
Murda Murda, leave mine alone
Betta mind your own,(or its)
Murda murda, When the heat is on
Betta ride with chrome(or its)
Murda Murda, If that beam is on
Your life is gone in it
Murda
We ain't even been threw Watts yet
The LAPD can't even walk threw the projects
Nigga's plant their seeds and bury a coffin
And flowers never grow when the Nickerson Gardens
Today there been 10 murders in South Central alone!
The boys in the hood said Cube been gone to long
So take my advice, im talking to all rappers
When you eat a Roscoe's watch out for the chain snatchers
Take it off slow, or you might get killed
If the Grape Streets don't catch you, the 60's will
Police don't give a fuck cuz they all renpark
And what happens in Crenshaw stays in Crenshaw
It's a jungle out there, but i take you to any hood. My brother is Mafia, yea I got family in inglewood
Welcome to Killafornia, its where I live
The zip code is 187 and the city is
Murda Murda, leave mine alone
Betta mind your own,(the reds)
Murda murda, When the heat is on
Betta ride with chrome(or its)
Murda Murda, If that beam is on
Your life is gone in it

100 Bars and Runnin,"You Know What It Is, Vol. 1 ",2002.0,"Who be, standing on Compton Blvd. in them Gucci's
Drinking a 40, it's me, the nigga with the uzi
Standing by the new 6 with creamy white rocks
White Tee, Dickies and a black fitted White Sox
This ain't Chi-Town but we got a windy city
Cause every bitch and fiend in Compton blow
Dr Dre signed the kid, watch Compton blow
We got a Cali gangbanger with a Yonkers flow
Now the streets is talking, wanna know where Dre found him
In that Impala, the same Impala I keep my pound in
Ain't no telling what the Game will do, muthafucka
I'll blow the guts out the dutch and do the same to you
And just to get shit cracking, I'll drop the toaster
Grab the Louie go Sammy Sosa
And you ain't gotta know me to know that
I hop out a new pink Rolls, with the '52 Pete Rose throwback
Haze in my eyes, listening to Bobby Womack
On the same corner where Eazy E sold coke at
I'm the nigga that'll smoke the purple
Get high as a kite, down half the Grey Goose
And choke one of your workers
Don't make me put two in your shirt
Dog, I'm putting in work
Then move bags like Dooney and Bourke
Then stuff work in the GMC
Cause on my block, I'm the king of rock like Run DMC
And I'll come through in the tan prowler
With guns in the stash
That'll turn your man face into clam chowder
Hold that damn powder, my niggas will squeeze
And bust all night like it's New Year's Eve
So lace your Timbs and polish your Gators
We like odds in Vegas
You can't ball then it's probably the haters
You can't breathe, then it's probably the desert
If you a gangsta or not
I give a fuck dog, bullets is hot
And you can find me in the hood with rocks in the Pyrex
Tan khakis and them Nike Airs with the dyed checks
So you know my CK's in your mommy's hamper
Cause I got a six tre that changes colors like Jolly Ranchers
And Busta Rhymes told me how to make money
If it ain't rap, it's the mac
Run up on you and take money
Now I signed with the 'math, I got out-of-state money
White boy from Yale, Cancun spring break money
Canary yellow diamonds in my chain, take honey
To the Four Seasons, before 4 I'm skeetin'
Before 5 she leaving
I know her man and I know what a four-five will leave him
On Rosecrans bleeding
The old man seen em', and he won't tell
He on a seafood diet and he don't eat shells
Ghost town back on the map, we gon' eat well
Nieces and nephews, Barbie cars with Sprewells
Ask around, they'll tell you I'm good with the raw cane
And skipped college then handle the rock like LeBron James
And I ain't mean to take shots at The Roc, or call names
Tell Jay when he visits LA to call Game
Let him know I squashed that beef, I'm bigger than that
In 5 years, I'm trying to be where Jigga is at
The CPT, that's where me and my niggas is at
Standing by that new Ferrari, liquorish black
And I got a story to tell, my yay talks to me
But, nobody believes that my yay talks to me
Late night in the coupe, Marvin Gaye talks to me
When I'm gangsta leaning, twisting purple haze off Remy
And the rims ain't cost me a penny
Came in the dice game
Z with the white frame and go with the Pumas
Think about it, you can die sooner
Got my 40 from Cincinnati and it throws bullets like boomer
Fuck a rumor, I copped a Lamborghini
Ride with the AC on
Red rag over my face and an Angels beanie
When you see me in the streets, it's real
It ain't no bangin on wax nigga, Compton is back
These rap niggas is hoes, need to holler at Don Juan
Faggot niggas with g strings under their Sean Jean
I'll let em' have it on a Compton strip, clip for clip
Or walk block for block through Harlem with Von Zip
Black Chuck Taylors, canaries shining on my wrist
With a desert and a line and grindin' like The Clipse
And they don't know if I'm a Blood or a Crip
When they see me rock the cherry khaki suit
Inside a smerf blue 6
And the fifth get em' downtown faster than 5 tokens
And put niggas in the ICU like bifocals
And I kill bi-coastal
I'll smash your Jersey
J. Kidd or the yellow and purple
The harder the nigga, the harder the work is
So I get high and listen to Pac's first shit before I write verses
I'm the Shaq on the block, Kobe with the rock
West with the shot, so nickname my johnson ""Earvin""
Don't get murdered
I got a Glock in the holster
That'll blow your fucking brains off the top of your shoulders
Dog, I keep it gangsta like I'm supposed to
With a 12 guage shotty and that Testarossa
NWA soldier, I'm no good, I'm so hood
Holla if you wanna die that bad, I bust guns that fast
And I rock my rag, like it's 88 and niggas still rockin' Shaft
So put the hundreds in the bag
Or I'ma put the eagle to your helmet
And the 5th to your chest like Donovan McNabb
I keep 16 in the clip, and I'll let em' all go
Like The Lakers did Elton, Eddie and Nick
We got bricks for 11.5, So many fiends
It's like a nigga been on the same corner since '75
NWA will never die
And I'm Compton's most wanted
100 bars and runnin!

Look what the fuck the wind blew in
Yo Clue, you better let em' know, nigga
This is Aftermath's young gun
Oh, you thought it was hard to get a deal on the west before?
Welcome to them fucking record labels now
If you ain't spitting like The Game
And 10 bars or less, your shit is a frisbee, nigga
So you better be concerned
This is Chuck Taylor, muthafucka
And I'll bring the west coast back by myself if I got to
You don't believe me?
Ask the nigga standing next to you
See what the fuck he got to say
Holla",https://genius.com/The-game-100-bars-and-runnin-lyrics
Fucked Up,Hoodmorning (No Typo): Candy Coronas,2011.0,"These niggas got me fucked up (x5)
These niggas got me, I think
These niggas got me fucked up

I be on the block with that chrome boy, Postin' up with my home boy
Leanin' on the 2 tone boy, What you want for them zones boy
10-5? 10-4, put it on the scale, add a little more
Take a shot of that 'tron boy, bag it up and then gone boy
They givin' quarters out, watch yourself on that phone boy
They gave me seventeen, his mama singing that song boy
We gettin' money baby, we gettin' cash money
Stuntin' like the Birdman, sittin' on my dash
120 on the dash, 4 Giottos on the wheeeeeels (on the wheels)
Paper stacking's too long boy, blowing Cheech and that Chong boy
Better watch that tone boy, headshots to that dome boy

These niggas got me fucked up (x5)
They got me, I think
These niggas got me fucked up
Hold up, these bitches got me fucked up (x3)
I think these bitches got me fucked up

Think a nigga trip the way I walk around
Gotta keep that pistol on my hip to lay them haters down
Gotta keep them bitches on my dick then I bring Game around
Paper stash gon' break em down, fuck 'em hard don't make a sound
I'm all up in your trap boy, ride around with that pistol
Gotta keep the bitch in my lap boy, hater niggas, come get ya
Made my niggas rab, my niggas clean, we do it, dare try to intervene
Thats suicide fuckin' with my team, I'm blowing clouds and I'm 'bout the cream
Yeah, and I'm bout that shit, we for of chips, and I'm flossin' hoes
Y'all full of shit, not suckin' the O's, I'm too legit and I'm tippin' 4's
You niggas really want it, bitches lookin' silly for it
Really kin the whip is foreign, niggas lookin' real important


Say boy, ever had a bitch all up in your crib
Stickin' that dick all up in the ribs
Then she tell fuck niggas where you live
And now they all up in your shit
Flippin' matresses over, turnin' couches sideways
They thinkin' crime pays
Got a choppa
For the niggas that don't understand how the fuck we ope-
-rate and anyway get back on top of my paper chase
Kush burnin', slow dragon, 29's, been had 'em
Niggas take shots, then runnin' high
We'll find their ass, Bin Ladin
Me and Mike in the Benz wagon, better watch your block boy
Purple clouds of that Pepé Le Pew, I'm gone of that Ciroc boy
Clipped up to that pop boy, holdin' on to that knot boy
Palms grippin' that Glock boy, we comin' back for them yachts boy",https://genius.com/The-game-fucked-up-lyrics
Now That I’m Paid,California Republic,2012.0,"Now that I'm paid....
Whoooo

Ridin' in a cab, but I'm dreaming on a slab
15 ounces at a time, pussy nigga, do the math
10 ice chains, prince like James
The day I made a stack in the trap, my life changed
Y'all rides swingers, we ride daytons
It don't matter where you from, haters stay hatin'
Keep the windows tinted, artillery when I'm in it
Whip it in the kitchen before Hillary became a Clinton
Assholes by nature, cash flows is major
In the old school, or M codes for kreggers (?)
Started with a crumb, and turned it to a brick
They were calling me a bum, my turn, I'm the shit
Razor flip things, age of 15 (hello!)
Parked the Chevy in that thing, glaze like Kris Kreme
Rolls on the wrist when the shows ain't exist
Now my money long enough to put my foes on a 6 (Bawse!)

I pull up front to the club with my doors to the sky
(Now that I'm paid)
I shut down the malls like a boss, 'cuz I gotta be fly
(Now that I'm paid)
I've got all the bottles I want, bottles I want to hit
I'mma do it 'cuz I've got all this money
Nobody gon' stop it (now that I'm paid)

Duffles full of Franklins, carpooling with Bawse
Army medal on the burgundy Ghost, fuck what it cost
Umbrellas in the doors, Audemars in the dash
Wale in that Ferrari, but that Phantom on his ass
We gon' spend this money, it's whatever, let them things pop
Kids gon' be alright 'cuz Daddy invested in wingstop
Money and residuals comin' like it's a ritual
Drinking this liquid money, them bottles gon' be invisible
Fuck the rest of you petty cash niggas, I'm invincible
Glocks identical, remove niggas from the physical
Smokin' that dual exhaust, flossin', fuckin' them haters
And finger fucking the waitress while sipping this Ace Of Spades
I'm throwin' money for nothin', Hawaiian kush I be puffin'
Sharin' hoes with my crew while these other niggas be cuffin'
Know she love that money game, stay fuckin' with double M
Think a nigga about to put her in that bubble Benz
Don't let the devil in!


Fuck these niggas, we got all these hoes

All this money, let me put you on

A New Day,UnKnown,UnKnown,"It's a new day my turn to ball
The streets is mine gotta hold it down at all cost
Gotta hustle till the sun go down
And I'm livin' for tomorrow just me and my 4-pound
Get money is all we know
Success breeds envy, then I love the dough
It's a new day my turn to shine
I'm startin' a new chapter on enemy lines

As a youth I was the truth
On sunday, without a suit
Gunplay, come out the roof
Drivebys and shootin' hoops
All I had in this cold world, was old girl
Need I explain the definition of a duece-duece
I was fathered by the OG's and coke heads
The days of suede pumas, tube-socks, and pro-keds
In California trap
This is a ballad of a soulja a new era before they stitched into fitted caps
You gotta feel em' black
These are the given facts
Vote the Doc' as President, Bush wanna diminish rap
What about the sports and entertainment
Never mind we more focused on Michael Jacksons arraignment
And everybody wanna be famous
Soon enough, The youth will be looking up to a million Lebron James's
Open your eyes or forever be lost
Somewhere in between west Los Angeles and east New York


We gotta get up out this mothafucka'
Wether we riddle, lacrosse, or dribble out this mothafucka'
Get my mind right, it's something I had to do
They tryna run me off the road on basketball avenue
I been through it all, thats why I pursue to ball
I was taught put it on the line win, lose, or draw
I been patiently waiting'
Fore' the day to meet satan
So he can see my Jordans planted on the pavement
Jesus Walks, to who made that immaculate statement
Deserves triumph for reaching out to black, mexican, white, and asian
He destined for greatness
Your body is a temple, temple is sacred
Once the words of a newborn Pastor Mason
What's the world coming to? How will it ever end
When men killin men over women in 600 benzes
Pray for the haters near me
Until I'm laid and buried
These are hoop dreams and the court is my sanctuary",https://genius.com/The-game-a-new-day-lyrics
Let Me Be The One,UnKnown,UnKnown,"You see I woke up in the morning, grab my blunt
And put my dick up out this bitch mouth (da, da, da)
I’m feeling like making this bitch iron my clothes or something
Multitasking, cooking breakfast, making a niggas wanna smack that ass
See I met this bitch on Crenshaw, she told me give her a ride
I said “If I do that, you gotta give me head while Ray Charles drive”
Cause I ain’t for the tricking, no I ain’t, I’m with my main bitch
And my side bitch, I’m feeling like Saddam, they have the bomb
And if her baby daddy tripping, fuck that nigga, I’ll push that nigga Hairline back like he LeBron
Make a nigga body disappear like J-Kwon, body found my the swamps, missing both of his arms
I ain’t playing, I’m with the rat-a-tat-tat, shoot a nigga, if he do or don’t die, he never coming back
Now it’s one, two, buckle my shoe, padded leather Guiseppe’s, nigga watch what the fuck I do
This the P-I-R to the U and I put that on my momma, I’mma ride for you baby boo
Yeah, yeah, I said I put that on my momma, I’mma ride for you baby boo

I hope you’re giving head today
I just want to put this dick all in you (So I can bust a nut)
Feel me we gon’ celebrate (celebrations)
You bring all your girls and I’mma bring my crew
(Let me be the one) you  take home at the end of the night babe
(Let me be the one) Only want you to myself babe
(Let me be the one) You know I’m open to suggestions
(Let me be the one) Down for you, should never be a question baby
(Look in my eyes) Help my mind, oh
Help my mind

Yeah, Quik is the name, with the Game it’s a goddamn shame
Niggas can’t see that we to blame for putting compton in flames
Ignite it up, haters get knotted up when you trill
Put canker sores in your whip, that’s what I do
To protect my party, my goons snatch you out by your Ed Hardy
Then we start the show, all the ladies drink free
All the players grad a tab, that’s how that’s supposed to be
Drinking  fucking faster than grand national regals
I’m in it with the pussy doing kegels (what?)
I’m so Fred Segal right now, she’s so spread eagle right now
Ain’t nothing but the clothes going down
I’m in the game and the fire’s the same
The music is imminent like even before my fame
I wrote about a thousand 16 bar verses
And I’m still coming off like this my first real hit

I hope you’re giving head today
I just want to put this dick all in you (So I can bust a nut)
Feel me we gon’ celebrate (celebrations)
You bring all your girls and I’mma bring my crew

(Let me be the one) Down for you, should never be a question baby
(Look in my eyes) Help my mind, oh
Help my mind

But DJ Quik got a bitch from the bay
Said she wanna fuck his little homie got her sipping on that Alizay
You ever had that fix up to Mausberg before
And had a Mausberg leaning on the front though?
Treat my dick like a newborn, hold the head
I told her, “bitch, pimpin’ ain’t dead, hoes are scared”
So stop that bickering, I got a bitch from the Nickersons
They got a fuckin’ bounty on my head
(I’m running with Chuck Taylors too
He doing something new
Something more comfortable for you to just bang your shit to
So lady go and work those hips like an inmate work those dips
Baby work those lips, if it don’t make dollars don’t holler
(It’s DJ Quik, in any year Impala
And if it don’t make sense, it don’t flinch
What do you get from a bull that don’t chew grass
No shit)

I hope you’re giving head today
I just want to put this dick all in you (So I can bust a nut)
Feel me we gon’ celebrate (celebrations)
You bring all your girls and I’mma bring my crew

When I see Lloyd Banks it's goin', (down, down)

Automatic rifle
And I'm blastin' on sight so
Ski mask, I'm psycho
My gun got night scope
Two in the leg knocked em, (down, down)
From Thirty feet away he fell, (down, and out)
Touch kids like Michael
One roll of the dice, oh!
You wanna gamble wit' your life
Nigga die slow
Now your casket goin', (down, down)
Tony Yayo
 tried to run
I chased him, (down, and out)
Cause' I hate the Jakes
Pat him down take his cake
He wanna be a clown nigga
Might as well paint his face
And that's how I get, (down, down)
Fuck G-Unit nigga I'm not (down, and out)
Used to ride wit' em'
Slice up the pie wit' em'
Got kicked out the group
Cuz I wasn't gon' die wit' em'
And that's how it went, (down, down)
At Hot 97 we came, (down, and out)
Had Thirty niggas wit' me
Niggas that sport the Dickies
Hoppin' out of cabs
We just want to talk to 50
We wanna know what's goin' (down, down)
Security pulled heat it went, (down, and out)
Had to shake the block
I ain't tryna' face the cops
Heard a couple shots
Then I seen shell cases drop
Told P-nut to get, (down, down)
I looked back and saw my nigga goin', (down, and out)
I said,""homie we can't leave em'""
What if my nigga dyin'
Soon as we hit Houston then
We heard police sirens
Oh shit!, it's goin', (down, down)
Guns out, they tellin' him to get, (down, and out)
He on both knees
Blood squirtin' out his jeans
Catch 22 should I go to jail or flee the scene
Either way it's goin', (down, down)
So I hopped in the truck and went, (down, and out)
Broadway in a black suburban
One thing on my mind
Go hard til' them fags get murdered
Cuz he tried to get my nigga shot, (down, down)
But he survived and now he goin' (down, and out)
To the station
Police at the Double-U waitin'
On me to arrive and now I gotta shake em'
They wanna take a nigga, (down, down)
We on the same elevator goin', (down, and out)
Dodger fitted
Got the Hova lean
So they ain't notice me
Now they mad as fuck
And gotta watch my Range Rover leave
Hit the 95 and head, (down, down)
It's to Philly so I can lay it, (down, and out)
Catch the first thing smoking back the L-A-X
Kicked up my Air Nikes
Then I slept the whole flight
Had a dream about it goin', (down, down)
Woke up and saw my plane comin', (down, and out)
Missed the palm trees
Sunshine everyday
New York's my second home
But from in L.A
And I hold shit, (down, down)
The throne was empty so I sat, (down, and out)
And just handled my biz
Theres two sides to every westside story
And I just tell it like it is
And that's how it went, (down, down)
On my son that's all that went, (down, and out)
So stop tellin' them lies to all them motherfuckin' magazines
And radio stations nigga you know what happened
Me and Lloyd Banks ain't, (down, down)
Keep talkin' shit, i'll lay you, (down, and out)
You niggas ran out the backdoor nigga
All I wanted to do was holla man
To see what was what
Y'all was too fuckin' scared to come, (down, down)

Same color as the lips
And the paint got a gloss

And the chapstick sticky just like the mary jane
Its the last one to Paris
Puff we can run a train
Cuz I wake up with sex on a plane
Sippin’ sex on a beach, havin’ sex on a plane
Game, she callin’ my name
But I dont know her
Nigga I dont know 1st

Have you ever rolled down in freeways? no chauffeur
Just Libras, Capricorns and Leos

Champagne bottles in both hands
Rose dont spill the whole thang
Girls swallow, blow like Chicago
Nigga get mad, uh, gun, throat, hollow
Dummy, ain't nothin’ young but the money
Got plenty girls you could take some from me
Ice in the bucket, keep the drinks comin’

I'm air tight, fresh in them Air Nikes
If the Navi outside, I might be there
Black hoodie, black 9, black wifey airs
Rock guns like Caddy trunks, keep a spare
You see the lump under the Iceberg fleece and gear
And when the beef cook, I'ma put the piece to your head
And if you see a white truck that mean yo' sheets is dead
Then I'm goin goin, back back
To the block to dump the bucket and jump in the drop
Niggas know I'm good with the Glock, they call me Chick Hearns
Cause if the game on knot, I'm callin the shots
I'll wear a shiny suit for a minute like I'm The LOX
Then get gangster with a swap meet bag and a Jordan box
And when I die, bury me with the Glock, and a bucket of shells
In case niggas want drama in hell

Yeah, so when Compton niggas and Fillmoe niggas get together
Shit happens mayne; real talk from ya nigga Fig'
Doin it big and don't wanna split yo' wig

I'll give you anything you ask fo' - money over bitches
Tell me what'chu blast fo' - fuck around with snitches
What you had to smash fo' - niggas tried to play me man
(1) Anything you ask fo' - all about this Bay game
(2) Anything you ask fo' - representin Bay game

I be the boy with the most cabbage, pluck strings like I'm Lenny Kravitz
I'm in the streets where they goin savage
One, two, we dance on the rooftop
Let the Coupe ghostride then we come to two stops
Figga eight'n by the corner sto'
Niggarali from killer Cali you gotta let 'em know
Yeahh, ya hit me on my Sidekick
Inventory pilin up, niggas tryin to buy shit
They got me diggin in my files
Pro Tools, ADAT tapes and big sounds
Jumpin on a plane, jumpin out a taxi cab
Stackin up this fettucini now these niggas hella mad
""Fuck that nigga!  He got another album on the board?""
Damn right, another album on the board
Fuck the bullshit, the Figgarali don't play
I represent the whole Bay every motherfuckin day


Count rubber band grands
I'm out big on the under, with my fam bam
And I, hover the lands
To expand, I'm from the gutter grime and the sand
No jams the flam's all busted
The dames want the bucks when, they see you stuffed in
Your pockets, 'til they get them some
But testin my pocket, only gets you none
Cause I, got a pimp mentality
The scrubs wanna eat shrimp, and get my salary
They ain't knowin I'm tight laced in my shoestrings
Hate the way I'm flowin on the mic, cause I do gleam
All types of baguettes and bezels

Y'all forgot who helped 50 Cent pop
I ain't spent my own money since Eminem dropped
In eighty-fo' I had the streets locked
I am to gangsta rap what Biz Markie is to beatbox
Niggas think cause I stopped on that ""Detox""
I traded in my All Stars for some Freeboks

Compton's version of Phil Drummond

Same ""Chronic"" just different smoke

You can C-Walk to this homey it's still love

Well look at me in the kitchen with the stove top
Ziplock bag, distribution to the whole block
Shit the whole city
We got the Paris Hilton, make your nose pretty
Make them fat hoes skinny
You got the smoke, we supply the chimney
Then we on the porch sippin' Mickeys like I know Minnie
Bitch lookin' for mollies? Tell her I got plenty
I'm in that cherry red Chevy right outside Denny's
You know me, lowkey

Keep it gutter

Even if they was I'm at the Staples, Louis Vuitton frames
Feet on the wood, nigga I could trip Lebron James
I keep it hood
Bandana with that bang bang
Red rag .45, that's the same thing
I take the same route home in the same lane
Same car, same nigga, just the fame changed
I walk around like I never heard the same Game
Watch Menace 2 Society became Caine
Then I became king leader of the chain gang
Still park my Rolls Royce and hop back on the same train
Then hop out on the same street
Where the dealers and the fiends eat
Where the killers and the everything in-between meet
Get your face covered with that white sheet

Having fear of Hard times
Theres no love to be found

I’m feeling like a black democrat
Barack Obama, the only nigga that can catch Osama
Spray lamas, get good head and fuck fly bitches with no covenant
Only the kitchen oven in and rules to the government
Ask the republicans how crack cocaine get smuggled in?
Watch them throw they hands up and say it wasn’t them
As for rap, this is my lyrical asthma attack
It’s all I know, the guns, the cash, the dro
Fidel Castro on my own right, Capone like
Mafioso, Ben Franky on the low pro
Drop top Bentley, chromed out semi
Two grand in popular demand like the first pennies
My Audemars Piguet wrist say it's time to dethrone Jay quick
Tell 'em other niggas to take six
Coupe a buck fifty, what’s coming out the speakers?
Got every video bitch scared to fuck with me

Having hard times
There’s no love to be found
Having hard times
There no love to be found

Shit gangster to the core
Ain’t no rap flame paint your kitchen floor
What you, you can’t ignore
Things you endure went up against the board
All I heard was easy don’t fill me no more
I hear your bullshit, I play matador
I’m outta category I ain’t there with you
I got a positive vibe, but I ain’t scared of ya'll
Hit the kid nigga dip, never that at all
Then red attack the wall, that black-ack-ack-ack-ack
I got a girl so fine her name Perignon
She know how to get them things in her carry on
I blow outta town Grants when I'm outta town
Uptown in the building how that sounds
Cause killas don’t get heard about
They get whispered about and you get murdered out, boy


You got it on your mind look daddy say something
All that play buckin' get your face buttoned up
And now when you smirk you look like Jay Z’s shirt
Steppin' on the turf

Give 'em hard dick and tampons
A shot of Patron and Don
The ones trained get ran on, my crew hard
Louis V sweaters on the boulevard
Pull niggas cars throw up signs and bang Nas

They call me J.R. I tell 'em come holla
I tell my poppa put away your dollars, your son got choppers
And if you got enemy’s, your son got enemies, that uptown energy

Only time for action, no time for tears
All these years been preparin' for right now
When they see the AK barrel, they pipe down
White sheets and nightgowns, sniffin' that blood hounds
Soldier, swallowed my own sweat and won't drown
My squad is thorough, my infiltry fifth ward
Scars on faces, long way from a ghetto boy
I'm built for this, I killed for this
Put everythin' on the line, blood spilled for this
They consider it madness, grew up an ignorant bastard
If it wasn't 'bout guns, I was skippin' them classes
Thickest assassin, pull it the fastest
Cock it and blast it, runnin' my racket
Put 'em all in the casket
Strikin' them matches, wrap you in plastic
Turn you to ashes
Call me for duty and I'll murder the masses

Can I live? Can I breathe? Or will I die with this flag on my sleeve?
What else, what else
Is it war? Is it pain? Will I survive 'til the end of the game? What else, what else

I'm on a suicide mission with pistols, I won't miss you
You with me, I'm with you, if not, the slug gon' hit you
Rip through your tissue, I don't think the world gon' miss you
Full magazine, 15 covers, the next issue
Ghost, not the luxury car, I'm talkin' hollows
Sub-missiles flyin' through the sky
You can find me in the shark tank, topped off, loadin' the scars
Tramplin' dead bodies in the field, full of blood
No remorse, of course we gon' be lit
We soldiers, trained to murder and won't miss
No time to piss, the realest in the midst
Lost in foreign land and we eat where we shit
Long machete arms, get chopped up in the jungle
Today could be your last, to hard to remain humble
Die by yourself 'cause you was born on your own
Some of the greatest kings got murdered on they thrones

Wake up in the morning, oh shit!
Had to cock the 9, niggas tryin' to steal my pits
Went out the back door, see them niggas hit the fence
I’m telling you, life in Compton is a bitch
Let off a couple shots, God damn, I missed
Say fuck it anyway, and let off the whole clip
I’m not to be fucked with, when I’m off liquor
Old English in my system, ‘bout to kill me a nigga
See, I remember back in the days, loadin’ my AK
Ridin’ ‘round in my Impala with my lungs full of haze
That's when I didn’t give a fuck, now I got my son
Shoot a nigga, he die, public enemy number one
But, this ain’t no action flick, no Johnny Depp shit
When the Tec spit hollow tips in your Lexus
So. Don’t fuck with a Compton nigga when he packin’ the gat
Yeah, nigga, I stay strapped

Somethin’ hot in here
Nigga, it must be me!
Somethin’ hot in here
Nigga, it must be me!
Is it the shades? Is it the J‘s?
Is it the Bentley with the full color ways?
Or the old-school sittin’ on blades
What could be?

It’s 2-o’-clock in the afternoon, I’m ‘bout to roll a Swisher
‘Cause that's what real niggas do when they at home
Watchin’ ESPN on the 70-inch flat screen
K-Gs and Wade jerseys, blowin’ chronic, that green
Gave up the hoop dreams, bubble with the crack dreams
Turn hood zombies into a Olympic track team
‘Till I got shot, and infiltrated the rap scene
Had to clean my life up, Doc gave me the vaccine
Don’t get it twisted, I still click-clack things
Red beam attached to each and every strap
That I keep locked up in my basement
If I shoot a nigga, will the Lord forgive Jayceon?
I don’t know, still got a sick fetish for shoot-outs and car chases
Fuck Pacino, ‘cause we know niggas with scarfaces
And we go back, like D-Boys and small faces
And we crashin’ new Ferraris while ya'll hatin'
Pharrell I think it’s

Somethin’ hot in here
Nigga, it must be me!
Somethin’ hot in here

Niggas cain’t fuck with me, real spit
I guess I am a motherfucking legend, Will Smith
All I’m missin’ is a bitch like Jada, Bonnie & Clyde shit
Hit the fence like later, sayonara, arrivederci
Black rose Phantom, interior hearse shit
And I got some kisses from a couple Brooklyn bitches
Them hoes’ll never testify, peace to Common
But Game keep it hood like weaves and Top Ramen
Never stop coming for the top
If the bass a flesh wound and Pharrell a head shot
Motherfucker, and when he take aim
Bullets enter your frame, my bars simi-lar
To a dragon swalloin’ flames
Cain’t walk through the club and take a piss
Without these new school rap niggas on my dick
While you fuck around with your jewelry and all your whips
I pull up with your bitch pumpin’ gangsta shit

When my nigga come home
We gon' pop champagne 'til it's gone
I tell you, when my nigga come home
We gon' celebrate!
Lobster, shrimp, Roscoes and steak
When my nigga come home
He can have any damn thing that he want

I got a nigga locked up for about a knot of money
He did nine years, be home before I finish this blunt
I just bought a ounce of skunk
Me and my nigga bout to go hard, like when LeBron dunk
We ridin' high, like southern niggas in the dump
Errybody and they mama know UGK in the trunk
(What's in the backseat?) North Kakalak freaks
And the shit we be smokin' could melt the Mac off they cheeks
Then we headed to that magic city, he ain't seen no ass and titties
In about a decade, these hoes about to get paid
They took him to the back, I ain't seen his ass in two hours
Two time felon taken a shower in the motherfuckin' strip club

Inhale, inhale
Blow it out, blow it out
Inhale, inhale
Blow it out, blow it out

When my nigga come home, that's on everything I got him
You know why? Cause we was like that, and we came from the bottom
You know how many bitches I was mad that I took
Cause I couldn't throw up the hood, the police had me shook
And all he wanted was a super head's book
So I sent it cause I meant it, now the clothes is for crooks (?)
And ya girl? She fine as a motherfucker
Told you she cheated on you? She was lyin' like a motherfucker
When you went in, we was dreamin' about the tre
Now it's four door flyin' spur, with Killafornia plates
Remember when we was in the spot, writin' to them Dre beats?
Now I'm fuckin' with some nerds, chattin' with Skateboard P
Remember when we was hard
Sayin' to each other nothin' ripppin' us apart
Now a nigga ballin' and you sittin' in the yard
But you comin' home to the Ferrari and a card, max that motherfucker out

Inhale, inhale
Blow it out, blow it out
Inhale, inhale
Blow it out, blow it out

One thing you can count on when you touch down
You gon' have it all, laid out, everything is paid out
Comin' home eventually, in the penitentiary
The homies like to mention me, cause I looks out essentially
Big Reese Cup, J Dog and Trey-D
Young Joe Dog, Scotty Boy, NYC

Blue put me on the set, nigga, it's twenty Crips
My cousin' Flip been locked up for twenty five

And I just voted for Obama, nigga

Funny how that chandelier used to be a ceiling fan
Funny how that Buick Regal, turned into a Lam
Funny how Lilly's grandson turned into a man

It's a dirty game, nigga, when you got cash
Bitches don't holla when a nigga on his ass

I'm the new era's logo, I'm the boss, I'm the shit
New Bentley truck,

Getting' lost in the wind, Chevy traffic on the rims
Got my bitch in that Benz, doin' 90 on the 10
I got 99 problems, not a motherfuckin' friend
See my niggas be my niggas, we gon ride it to the end
In the club, blowin' them racks cause that space never cheap
We got three bottles a piece 
and we all got pizzas
When it come to all this money we divide it like pizza
When it comes to fuckin' hoes we gon slide 'em like Visas
Bitch I'm 'bout my paper check and heat blows in Geneva
Puerto Rican in Geneva and she got Ferrari features
Shittin' on you peons, these Dom bottles neon
Use to run the rock and bass like Deion

I'm in the Cincinnati gettin' money like vodo
Across the world, gettin' all this money
I can't get enough (Money Gang be the logo)
Ladies see it when that Phantom pullin' up woah oh
I'm in the Cincinnati gettin' money like vodo
Across the world, gettin' all this money

Ladies see it when that Phantom pullin' up woah oh

What you don't know is I be in that 4-door
And what you do know is I be in that hew blow
But what you should know is I be fuckin' Suge hoes
And that could go anyway on any day
Twenty bottles of that Ace, twenty models in my face
Flew to Chicago for these J's

I'll sleep outside for the rest of my life if the rap shit don't work out al'ight?
No ice on the nigga
Your wife on a nigga
You don't like no nigga?
Let me put the red light on a nigga
Bad bitch from France, she gon put them spikes on a nigga
Then we in New York sittin' next to Spike on the niggas
But I'm rootin' for the Clippers
Getting sued tryna move for them strippers
Keep the tool and nigga ain't gon slip up
Jack the Ripper, nigga ain't gonna slip up
Slow down, taking your hoes down
Nigga we in your town, spilling in some more now
Money Gang got tracks and spas
Guess you could say we the new Mo Towns

I'm lookin' for a bad bitch and she know what I want
Red vone and you better bring a friend
Why fight it in the front and you know I gotta stunt
Fuck the line, girl you know we gettin' in
I shut it down in my side of town
Fuck your girl when you're not around
She in love with my bank roll
She like the way I make her go (uuu)
Move around the city with a chick like J Lo
Fuckin' with a boss, baby everything paid fo'

Money Gang, MG be the logo
It's Atlas, B dub S if you don't know, dog
You only live once, yo lo
So I'm at the bar, taking shots to the head, Miguel Cotto
Wrist froze like a person's pose for a photo
Big dog yard, you ain't allowed in here, Toto
We don't lose, only move for that money
If it ain't about that money I don't move rocks
Phantom on cruise, engine on the hood
Heavenly white paint job
Hater face look like he smelled a stink bomb
(Look at it) Got me feelin' like a ball player
I don't play ball but I ball like a star player
I'm a star hater, you know how I do
Swag super stupid, got a low IQ
Bottles in the air like we don't got a care
If you do it like we do it, baby hawl it if you hear

I'm in the Cincinnati gettin' money like vodo
Across the world, gettin' all this money
I can't get enough (Money Gang be the logo)

Laugh,UnKnown,UnKnown,"It all started back in '02
I never thought Compton and Marcy would ever feud
I ain't talkin' bout the big dude, big brotha to Kanye
Or da homeboy to the big dude
The fiance to Beyonce, had a protege
But wadn't no protege
That was as cold as Dre's
Fuckin with me, mc's seen their coldest days
He from Compton, rap like he from New York in the golden age
First nigga since Ice Cube from California to make Funk Flex blow grenades
I'm on the stage
I hear the crowd callin' my name
They goin' (Game, Game)
But I'm not one so don't try to play me
This goes for every nigga from Gucci Mane to Jay-Z
It's not a diss nigga don't catch feelins
I'll pull out the pen D.O.C. gave me a kill it

If I could show you all the faces of the MC's that I ripped....ah you would laugh, you would laugh, you would laugh

As the clock strikes twelve on my rolly
And this bitch from da Big Pimpin' video starts to blow me (blow me)
In the phantom, I start to fantasize
This shit get thicker than bitches in Atlanta thighs
It's suicide...if you think you could fuck with the seven time platinum driver of that land rover truck
And my ego bigger then the 26's, what if my pen had low pros
I could ride them beats, like I ride backstreets
After Snoop & Nas hang it up, its a track meat
Nigga this race is fixed
Game recognize Game, I ain't never second place n' shit
My first 2 albums real basic shit
Spend half the time in the studio erasing shit
A Queens nigga made me mad, So I made some hits
And learned one thing, hip hop can take some dick (aaaah)

If I could show you all the faces of the MC's that I ripped....ah you would laugh, you would laugh, you would laugh

Half these rap niggas wiping they tears
The other half wonderin' how the fuck Game got here
I took some weed up to Frisco, came back with a demo
Drove to Dre's studio came back in a limo
It was that simple
The cristal bottles and the bitches came later
And so did the haters
As the doc turns the nob on fader
And I turned the TV cause I'm tired of watchin' the raiders
Fast forward then Shaq gettin' traded
Then fast forward again then Shaq gettin' traded
And fuck all the time that was wasted
Beefin' with these wack niggas had me lost in the matrix
If I wanted the throne I would just take it
Put this .38 to yo dome bitch and just take it
I'm the music and it's time to face it
You niggas so fuckin' pussy I can taste it

If I could show you all the faces of the MC's that I ripped....ah you would laugh, you would laugh, you would laugh
If I could tell you all the things that I would do to kill yo favorite MC you would cry, you would cry, you would cry",https://genius.com/The-game-laugh-lyrics

I ain't talking 'bout bagging up work when I put Yayo in the bag
Fuck is you rhyming about?
You 30, just getting in the game, you should be trying to get out
You it's drama when the llama get out
Pull and spit the lead
Bullets hit your head
Then your mind'll sit out
By the time they find this shit out
I'm in a different state
In a different zip, different whip, different plates
Wait! I put the heater to your head
You G Unit Ninja Turtles cause your leader is rat
Scrat!
It's simple as 1,2,3

Wanna get at Game
You gotta come through me

All I need is a couple dumbells and a sandwich
Fuck holding a conference
I'll run to Violator, hold Chris Lighty for hostage
Cause Banks doing gay porn, come out the closet!
Either that or I'mma knock Chris Lighty unconsciencious
Cut all the non-sense
You was PC'd up
Hit the bricks, rapping 'bout the corner like you Common
Talk of New York? You Jorge Pasada
I throw 'em, you catch 'em, that's not a threat, that's a promise
You did 6 months, now you a convict?
I accepted your phones calls now you got me on some wild shit
Judge said, ""Time spent""
Now you can get it from the same gun homicide dropped five dimes with
And next time you try to kiss me on the cheek
You won't be alive long enough to put out my heat

Welcome to the west, let me show you what hood like
My niggas down to sit on death row and ain't fucking with Suge Knight
Tag your left toes, wish you niggas a good night
Rock-a-by baby

Screaming, ""Ready to die""
Them niggas ain't crazy
On the black wall on the mini street that they can't be
A pine box plenty of leg room

And drive foreign cars, nigga we stars
Fuck bitches at our leisure
Stuff dick inside they throat 'til they have seizures
Hoes down, B's up
Roll the trees up, Smokey Robinson
Get high, start trippin', I like his jewelry, then I'm robbin' son
Fuck a platinum plaque, nigga hood with it
Bouncin' that Impala down the shore like, ""What's good with it?""
I'm a made man, I wear J's and
I been around more rocks than a fuckin' caveman
I done sold it and bagged it
I done drove it and crashed it
Fucked my credit up smashin' the Aston
F.Y.I., nigga, I got a magnum
Only time I been punked was by Ashton Kutcher
I'm a motherfuckin' butcher
Leave me around anything white and I'ma cook it
I be all up in the kitchen, no need for an apron, playboy
I'm a professional, I'm cakin', playboy

Your chest'll be full and my clip'll be empty
I'm simply one of the most raw niggas in this shit
Why you think that I got in this shit?
Paid for my momma house, 'bout 700k
Can't stop smokin' but I'm down to a blunt a day
Yay, I mean yayo
On the block, sun up, sun down, like where the day go?
We come through chargin', nigga, like San Diego
Seventeen chargers, couple of 'em same color but the shit is ok though
'Cause all my niggas on the payroll get caught slippin' and get a halo
And I ain't talking 'bout the Xbox
Niggas let the tech knock
Welcome to the real-life Black Ops
Where it's still fuck the police, white or black cop
And we ain't killin Jonny Law, nigga, give 'em an ass shot
Put him on injured reserve
Tie my number twelves up and then I give him the bird, word
That's how I get down, all you rap niggas floppin'
Who talkin' shit now? Only Drake and Yay worth coppin'
I take a hiatus, spend a little time gamblin' in Vegas
Come back to back runnin' faster than five Lakers
So motherfuck a hater and his family
About to finish the R.E.D. album up in Miami
Lebron can't stand me, 'cause I got this Purp in my cup
24s on the truck, Laker Game, nigga, what?
Ballin, Jim Jones voice, problem with the Byrd Gang?
See the chrome, boy, and my mother fuckin homeboys?
But I'm from Cali not to be confused with Khaled
He say that we the best but I'm the best, that's valid
And before you try to say that that's a diss
I was at Khaled's house two days ago,  bitch
Sippin' Long Island Iced Teas with a white bitch
That was just as bad as Ice-T's, but she's not the wifey

Nigga hella-flamed up, flagging and all that
Nigga told me he come through Cedar Block
Out there in Compton and shit
I said if this was one of my niggas from New York this nigga be my nigga
Even though he from the West Coast, he still my fuckin' nigga
Crazy shit though is even though it seem like the homie be strugglin' between good and bad
At the end of the day, it always come from a genuine place
Love that nigga

I wake up in the morning to Ciroc and some pancakes
Give a fuck about a bar, bitch, this a mixtape!
Give a fuck about a car, bitch, this a Rover!
You drivin' a mistake like me dissin' Hova
But I don’t give a fuck, nigga, do it all again
Rule number one, never make a rap nigga friend
But I run up on a muthafuckin' rap nigga Benz
In Miami feeling like Khaled, “All I do is win""
Eighty thousand on the bracelet, watch got a face lift
Drivin' through the hood in this muthafuckin' spaceship
Feelin' like the first man on the moon
Draped in all black, whole club full of goons
Pumpin' bottles 'til them pretty hoes move
Tonight I’m fuckin' with bitches with scars and bullet wounds
Live in that Ferrari, sleep in it like a tomb
Soo Woo straight up out my mama womb, nigga

I'm in all red like my brake lights
In the kitchen on the stove
Tryna get my cake right
I work late nights, graveyard shift
Nigga gotta keep it trill
I’m blessed like the angel on Rolls Phantom grill
Don’t make me hit my brake lights

Gotta get it baked right
Eyes in the rear view
So I can see clear through the haters

From the cradle to the grave nigga, do it hard body
But I never fuck with a bitch with a hard body
Soft as a peach, life is a beach
And I’m in Venice laid on the beach, white sheets
With a dime-piece starin' at my timepiece, what it say?
By six o'clock we be chillin' at the Mandalay, nice
Chandon on the ice
Swimmin' in this fuckin' money, buy a hatin' nigga life
Ask about mine, nigga, I reply twice
Bitches run around my house, three blind mice
Get lost in this muthafucka
But I never get crossed in this muthafucka
Rottweilers at the door!
Dobermans by the pool, Dimes by the furnace
Live life like Capone cause a muthafucka earned it
Paper planes with them hunnid dolla bills
Spent a couple mill but still, nigga

I'm in all red like my brake lights
In the kitchen on the stove
Tryna get my cake right

One love to my niggas, two claps for my hoes
Buy a dime piece some clothes, well nigga, I suppose
I can get her Jimmy Choos, don’t mean that I'ma do it
Went light skinned 'cause my first baby mama blew it
Now I’m stuntin’ on dem hoes, what happened to the Buick?
Nigga turned rap star, God bless music
Now a nigga gettin’ head whenever I choose it
Blues Brother’s jewels covered in that new Goose n’
Grew up on that Snoop shit, Gin got me woozy
Got me feelin' sorry for my nigga Lil' Boosie
Turn up the fuckin’ radio, bang a lil' Gucci
Get high as a hummingbird, and touch a little coochie
Yeah, I’m a made man, bitch what you thought?
If I want an Aston, that fuckin’ bitch bought
Tell my nigga AR, 'Go open up the vault'
And fuck what it costs, money talk, nigga

If you want it, you can come and get some
If you got it, you can pay the ransom
Where the party at?

Riding with a G bitch, smoking on a G stick
In a G wagon, I'm always on some G shit
Used to be in G rides, bumping Warren G shit
Used to be in G5s, now I'm in the G6
Used to be in GRs, now I'm with some G-Stars
Couple G's in every pocket, sitting where the G's are
Used to be in UG Village with my G ma
Hand on the Jesus, RIP to my G-Pa
See life is up and down like a seesaw
And everybody working tryna get they RiRi off
You got pregnant teens and absent fathers
Outta town niggas they clapped regardless
It's a trap for the young
If you ever answer wrong when they ask where you from
And niggas gotta watch them colors
They say banging played 'til they get they bodies verified by their mothers

Somebody running outside, yelling 187
Aye, where the party at?
When the drug dealers and the fiends outside all day
Where the party at?
Uzis and grenades, we flocking handguns
If you want it, you can come and get some
If you got it, you can pay the ransom
Where the party at?",https://genius.com/The-game-uzis-and-grenades-lyrics

Yeah muthaf**kers
It's the muthaf**kin Game
Gu, gu,...gu,gu,gu,gu, G-Unit
I got a hundred guns and a hundred clips
Nigga I'm in New York (New York)
Wit a hundred Bloods and a hundred Crips
Whenever I'm in New York (New York)
I got a hundred guns and a hundred clips Nigga, I'm in New York (New York)
Ride wit a hundred Bloods and a hundred Crips
Whenever I'm in New York (New York)
Everybody wanna know why he got beat
'Cause in my dreams I talked to 'Pac and B.I.G
Got on the plane hopin that the NYC
It's me behind these bars like Chi-Ali
Niggas want me to D-i-e
Been there done that
Woke up from a coma on 3 IV's
Eyes on the thrown, somebody in my seat
Fiddlin with rap like Miri Ben-ari
I scoop up squares, drive thru the Bronx and get Jada on the phone
My next stop is Yonkers
After that its Harlem, why?
'Cause im a certified gangsta
And Jim Jones' throwin a Blood party
Red bandanas from 93rd to 115th and Lennex
It's the sequel to Menace
Oh Lord he then went ""Oh dog""
Made 50's beef his and knocked 'em both off
(Chorus)
New aftermath chain on, master bling
Stones yellow and black he a Latin King
Mela mak king ton efala se mon
Translation: I get money off ringtones
King Blood, even though I used to sling drugs when i see snoop he tell me ""Keep doin your thing 'cause""
I do it because I love it
Do it for the niggas that don't know the difference between 'Chuck Taylors' and chuckers
I'm a gangsta tell Remi Martin I wanna f**k her
Thats what I call a championship game out in ruckers
Ja rule want beef, change the subject
You ain't got no stars like the flag of the Dominican Republic
After Angie's show I was fiendin to get a bus
And catch a cab to Housten and ask any nigga hustlin
I ain't got to live in New York all my life to know the A and D train go to Washington Heights
(Chorus)
Left the VMA awards, went back to the hood
Streets is talkin, Game got slapped by suge
False, I was face to face wit him
Media wanna criticize the game
Like he had Ma$e wit him
He a hood nigga that ain't ever try to snake niggas
Walk thru the 5 boroughs never had jake with him
Bake it any way you want, ain't no cupcake in him
Even Diddy know, I make the city glow
Never had an album, never had his own video
I was sellin crack while Ja was watchin 50 blow
White tee shirt, converse and my dickies on
Signed wit Dre recorded 150 songs
Now the f**kin hip hop police hatin
Tryin to run me outta New York like Anthony Mason
Nigga I'll come and erase you
Only nigga from california
That'll come from the tongue wit a race

Tell the devil throw me a shovel and let's get it in

Pull my khaki suit back out the closet and burn this Louie
Tell Young Thug come out the closet, the fuck you foolin'?
Where my Crips, my Bloods, my eses? Let's make some music
That the gangsters can dance to
Throw up your hands too
The indians is back, we want our motherfuckin' land too
The black Slim Shady is back with some M80s
In the back of the Mercedes
About to blow this motherfucker like a meth lab
Smokin' on that same bomb chronic Dre and Meth had
You know I got the best bag
Now watch me teach the world how to roll a blunt for the last time
Welcome to Cali where smoking's our favorite past time
And if a nigga need a gun he can have mine
And everything inside

Cause when the lights go out
Cause when the lights go out
Cause when the lights go out
Cause when the lights go out

You see bitches on all fours
Switches on all cars
Got used to drivin' them Bentley's
I guess I got off course
Got used to fuckin' them bitches
Used to 'em rollin' my blunts
In the studio with Doc, ain't see them hoes in months
I've been shacked up on LSU
Goin' crazy on LSD in a straight jacket, don't mess with me
'Til I finish this album
Now I step inside the party with Hennessy and Bacardi
Pour a ziplock of mollies out (and a bowl of percs)
I'm a lunatic
Disturb the peace like Ludacris
Me and Dre bump heads cause he give me advice
I never listen to that shit
He said don't put out mixtapes and I did that
He said leave his car parked right there
I stripped that, drove that
In the Lambo, blunts rolled fat
Pull up to the club like where the hoes at
Take a ho and fuck her, then ask a bitch where your clothes at
The door right there
I don't need you bitche, you see the iPhone?
There's some more right there
Here's a glass for your tears, let 'em all right there
Compton, I was born right there
Park the red Lambo right there
Signed to the 'Math right there
25 mil, more nightmares
Now I'm fuckin' everybody bitch

So close your eyes just one last time as I put you sleep

Don't make me pull the piece on em, throw up the peace on you
Rest in peace, you don't want no beef
Don't make me pull the piece on em, throw up the peace on you

As I hit corners in that Lamborghini swervin'
Them doors fly up, look like I'm riding in a bird
So sick, put the 22's a inch from the curb
Watch the niggas fade away like the smoke from the herb
So I hop out, in my true religion denim
Cause guns my true religion
And my Desert Eagle's in 'em
Then I pull out;
Like I should have did when I was twelve, she had a miscarriage anyway
Oh well, back to my story
I start shootin' up the block
They shootin' up block, ""Oh shit! It's the cops!""
No is not, (woohoohoohoo)
It's just the ambulance, put another clip in and let the hammer dance


I swear to God, these niggas runnin' so fuckin' fast that
One nigga tripped so I shot him in the ass
""Why you make me do that?""
I'm usually a cool cat, like Kool Herc, Kool G, or any other cool nigga that rap
But I ain't come to talk, I came for revenge; to avenge the death for my hip-hop friends
I know, I know you never meant to get 'em killed, never meant to drive the car
They never handed you the steel
Apologize now. I know when you see him you will
But I got one question:
""Nigga how does it feel that they're going now, and you're going now?""
Put it to his dome, (BLAAAOW!) He is going home now, bye


My Air Force Ones are comfortable, but they not built to last
Especially when you chasin' motherfuckers up and down the ave
Niggas hit a couple fences, ran through some backyards
And I am not Reggie Bush, I'm heading back to my car
As I walked around the corner, I was like
""Damn! Los Angeles PD's behind my Lam - Bo.""
Runnin' my plates, before I can hit the gate
I can hear the cops yelling out, ""Wait!""
So I turn around, approach my shit
He said: ""Aren't you the guy that used to sing with 50 Cent?""
""Why, yes I am.""
That was my reply
""My daughter loves your songs, good day.""

I'm sittin’ here thinkin’ ‘bout all the things I could do
So what you should do is
Play your position for Berkin bags, we poppin’ tags
Her shoe game sick, we drinkin’ Ace out of Red Bottles
True gang shit, fuck with me and you’re famous
Kanye'd my bitch, now she’s away from the nameless
Camera flashes from strangers, turn a Range to a manger
Jesus piece on the plate, yea my baby an angel
Fell straight up out of Heaven into what we into
Who knew we’d grew into, whatever we into
That’s too much for your mental so we snapback that
Game on point like the stripes on my Gucc backpack
My ladybug, yea she cool like that
In them Trues, why you move like that

You know my lady always on
She know I need it so
She know she can get
All that, all that, all that, all that, all that
My lady got me going
I’m where she already knows
She knows she can get
All that, all that, all that

Uh, you my lady
And that pussy feel like a haven
We can make babies, let’s be creative
She say leave them tricks alone but I’m a skater
I love her like her daddy, told her no man would
I got a lot of bad bitches, she the only one good
I got her flowers for nothing, she smiling and blushing
If I don’t answer my phone, then we probably fucking, ya
She love my tattoos
Ain’t got no room for her name but I’mma make room
She let her hair down, we have a stare down
She said “I’m glad you ate it, "" where my cap & gown?
Told her “I can be your chauffeur,” dick like a limo
Multiple orgasms, that’s my M. O
Redbone pretty
I kiss her from her titty to her clitty

My lady got me going
I’m where she already knows

All that, all that, all that

Look, my girl’s sweet like my hotel floor
From where they ran through more keys than a hotel door
Indeed, give her the D now the whole hotel know
Feel like I’m looking down from Heaven screaming “Oh, Hell no!”
When you hop on top, girl, that’s what it feel like
She always had a player back like them field lights
And every time I left it ain’t feel right
Cheated on her and she stayed, that’s just real life
Cause it’s hard when you ain’t on the same coast
Burning bread in the club so all these girls want toast
Hoes try and wave but we ain’t on the same boat
They trying to sink everything that we made float
She told me ‘bout her ex man, her old boy stories
And how she had a dildo, you know, toy stories
Don’t fuck her on her period, ain’t into horror stories
I take her to my favorite restaurant, she order for me
Cause she know me

You know my lady always on
She know I need it so
She know she can get
All that, all that, all that, all that, all that
My lady got me going
I’m where she already knows
She knows she can get
All that, all that, all that

I’m loving your swag
I like how your jeans fit
You’re killing that bag
You working them heels
Your diamonds are real

Putting five to them planes, that La Bamba shit

Had them rocks and them bands like Green Day
I used to listen to, Project Pat tote straps and sell crack
Used to smoke that Bobby Brown
, fuck rats and sit back
On my forte, was more yay, my enemies got gift-wrapped
The two nicks in two days, got new fits and new Js
Thankful for my two Ks, 
my vision clear as Blu-ray
Kill your ass today, knock the glue off your toupée
My guns like ""hi"", leave that shy shit to Lupe

Hit a few corners in the Chevy then I'm droppin' it
Yeah, I'm block dimin' it, my bird's real confident
Never flip 'em where you lay your head, now that's common sense

Never stress about the downfalls just 'bout the getback

And I ain't sayin sex is wrong, just make sure he strap a condom on
And never, ever do it in your mother's home

Yeah, never call a girl a bitch, show respect, son pop ya collar
Ain't nothin free, scrape and lock every dollar

But I gotta keep this product on the street
Tryna take over my turf
Stretch me out in a hearse cause that is what it's worth
Baby momma keeps sweatin' it nigga, cause the rent's due

And do whatever it takes to keep my family straight
Livin' in Compton, some say it's suicide
Crossin' the street and catch a bullet from a drive by
My homie Dan's got it sippin' on a séance
So many dead homies
When I hear about it I can't cry
I lost my grandmother, that's when I flipped
Only decision to make now, blood or a crip

Cut through the projects and that's when I threw the Glock

Runnin' with the wrong niggas, that will take you under
That's what happened to my nigga Big Wheel
Trusted the wrong bitch, that's what got his ass killed

How do you survive when everybody's your enemy?
Before you brush your teeth grab your strap
Cause niggas will pull the jack and bitches will peel you cap

I gots to get it, I got, gots to get it

Ain't nothin' better than a down ass bitch
When you're locked up in the pen and she sellin' you neck and flicks
On the tear, reminiscin' like a mother
Two strikes on the case file, locked up state
Now tell me how the fuck I'm supposed to be a father to my kids?
Son gang bangin' cause his daddy doin' nine years
And that happens in every hood in America
Shoot your own brother up and wonder why they scared of ya
And your momma at home without a back bone
Your girl gettin' tired of waitin' so she get her back blown
By your homie, that used to be your man
And you can't do shit cause you're sittin' in the can
And when you get out, you'll probly go and kill this nig
On the third strike, man the jury 'bout to kill this nigga
That's why I don't trust a nigga or a bitch
Cause either way a nigga always ends up caught up in some shit

Nigga I tell the bitch quit
Sit down, shut up and floss my shit
My music gone, all that talkin' ain't it
So sit down, shut up and roll my shit
Now smoke with me, hook up my folk with me
Now take this money and hold this up for me
Now let it soak for me
Now bitch is you ready?
I gots to get it, I got, gots to get it

Yea
Game recognize game, nephew
See, when a bitch with me she know if to talk
She gon sit down, shut the fuck up and roll motherfuckin' weed
Talkin' is not an issue, you understand me?
Bitch, you do as I say
When I tell you to talk, you talk and I ain't told you to talk so shut the fuck up
You hear me?
Real pimp shit nigga
West Coast
We stay keepin' our hoes in check
Hey, that's your own problem man
Bitches takin' your all equip, runnin' you niggas crazy
Got niggas wanna kill like yourself
Man, fuck a bitch man
I grab a bitch, same dizzle and wizzle
You understand me?
I keep bitches like I keep weed
I got blueberry, AK-47, trainwreck
Whatever you need, ya dig?

In that all black phantom hug a block like a bear
Yeah That V12 is roaring
Flying through the city with the pedal to the floor and
I'm putting 26 inches on the curve
Tell the hood I'm back
Give me the Quarter and let me serve
Swab, I'm still dope that's my word
All I did was wished the kitches and some track all on a bird
Eerb, Goddy u know I'm a murderer
Half these niggas beefing with me
I never heard of them
If I was the old me I would murdered them
In matter of face if I was the old me I would hurt him still

Gave Mike all my demo came here to pay my deuce
Started off with who can
Then I start blazing blue
It was all a dream like Big said it be
Don't sleep on me homie I bring nightmares to reality
Rap phenomenon define the rules of gravity
Studied off classic start revising my strategy
Cause Marshal Matthers made it
Curtis Jackson made the hell
And the clouds wonderin' where the hell Marvin Gabe went
How do I say this I'm living for my son
But I can't figure out why I'm at my temple with this gun
Wake up to a Jesus piece like a Catholic nun
To war to be a rap legend has just begun (begun)

Silence the lambs with a .45 in my hand

Knock a muthafuckin' cop toothless
Payback's a bitch 4 that Rodney King shit
16 years later a muthafuckin' madman
Louder than the drums in the California bandstand
Head nigga in charge hnic
That's me
Born in raise in the Cpt
I get funkier than the funky drummer in the Roots band
Stomp harder than muthafuckin' Jodeci boots and
I get psycho
Shoot like Michael
When I say fuck the pigs I ain't talkin' 'bout white folk
So don't get offended
Or apprehended my ak-47 back with a vengence
So shine them fuckin' lights in the back of my car
I might kill yo ass in 2000 raw

Kick shit like I was born with a muthafuckin' soccer field on my lawn
Stay with the 8ball
Like MJG
I hate the muthafuckin' pigs cause them pigs hate me
And I should kill 51 cops
For the 
51 shots
That they gave that fuckin' kid in New York
I'm mad
That the KKK traded the sheets and the robes for a gun and a muthafuckin badge
And I ain't never shot a cop but if they do me like Huey P Newton
I'm pullin' Glocks
I refuse to let a pig run away from a farm
And put them muthafuckin' handcuffs on my arm
I bet the government got Obama in the scope

Full of niggas that don't give a fuck about a bad cop
That Denzel in Training Day shit'll get yo ass shot
Cause in 2000 raw we ain't playing that
You scared of us we scared of ya'll so we staying strapped
Before I let a muthafucka kill me in the streets
It'll be a gold plated badge under them sheets
Cause you muthafuckas corrupted
Can't be trusted
Bullet-proof vest wearing always on that tough shit
Punk ass police pull me outta my seat
What make a muthafucka wanna plant drugs on me
Is it cause I'm black and I rap got tats
On my face and my back and was born in the trap
Screw face when they roll up
It's cool nigga hold up
So my son don't grow up
To be a muthafuckin'

Ridin with a 12 gauge, nigga fuck haters
I got a debt to pay, this for Eazy
And I'll blast any punk mothafucka' don't believe me
I spit 16's
Fuck rap, I got a Mac that'll turn your white T into a Ms. King
I got a attitude, so fuck it
And I'm in the field with them birds like TJ Duckett
LA to NY, the public love him
He the next Ice Cube, so what he thuggin'
And he signed to Aftermath, so what he Bloodin'
You heard that Whoo Kid, I'm in New York buzzin'
Get a XXL and read about me
Page 86, the West can't breathe without me
Kevin Liles, how the fuck could you even doubt me?
I smile, now I got the A-Team around me
In Compton, that's where Dr. Dre found me
Gangbangin', chain hangin', cane slangin' but we turn it to rock
Dope spot so hot the shit burn in the pot
The O.G.'s kept the fiends in line straight
When I was a juvenile, gettin' cash money in '98
That's gangsta, and I'm 21 now
I ain't pick up the mic and put the guns down
It's survival of the fittest
So let's see if he can survive with ten bullets flying through his fitted
These niggas is bitches
And I gotta let the world know that I'm a mothafuckin' straight up menace
I got a semi so don't fuck with me
Or the Compton PD gon' have to come get me
Off your ass and I don't really give a fuck
I let the Eagle blow, nigga what
I got work, so listen to the words, man
We fuck with the rock but don't call us the Byrd Gang
Nigga we criminals
You got beef? Say my name on wax, nigga fuck the subliminals
And it don't matter if you Blood or you Crip
That bulletproof vest don't stop them blue tips
You see me in the streets, you got a Glock then use it
We mob deep, but this ain't Murda Muzik
Keep poppin' that shit, then the tools'll spray
Cause I'm a natural born killer like Cube and Dre
And I'm down with the capital CPT

Face of L.A.,The Face of L.A.,2006.0,"Exclusive

I thought I leave you niggas wit a little something to play with
While I finish my fuckin' album
Everybody wanna know when the fuck my album comin' out
Whenever the fuck I drop it
Wait...

Here the breakdown
Before I tell y'all who I be
I gotta say 
Proof R.I.P
That's for Em
The 40 ounce spillin' that's for him
I got the system in the Bentley on blast for him
I go bananas like classic Timbs
And my lyrics go over a niggas head like a new era brim
And I bang like a new era brim
Translation: A brim is a blood; like me and Mac 10
Any nigga want the drama I reach for the Mac 10
Make the fitted cap spin, 'till it peel back skin
Eazy baby you don't want it, believe me baby
Yeeeeaahh, like Jeezy baby
L.A. on my face, the logo from the Dodger brim
I'm the face of L.A., you gon' see a lot 'o him
The niggas behind me, you gon' see a lot them
Enough niggas to fill up every room in the Ramada Inn
A&R's at the label like ""not again, every time we put a nigga out Game slaughter them""
Catch 'im the alley, what you gon' do without your man?
Feel like I'm Bishop standing over Radames
You niggas bitches, throwin' rocks, then hide ya hands
'Till I chew yo ass up like Flintstone vitamins
I smell pussy, somebody let the cats loose
I'm the Drama King, you'd think I found Papoose
Who's next to put on the rat suit?
I fuck 'em Doggy Style, you can go ask Snoop
While I bump this Mobb Deep in the Cadillac coupe (haha)
Nah, I really like track number 2
So I put a 100 bars on it, you couldn't make my freestyle whack if you went and put Chico DeBarge on it
I'm so hard homie, I swear to god homie
50 Cent'll still bet his fuckin' black card on me
Be cool, cause when the heats drew
Them hollow tips'll fuck up ya stomach, like seafood
My niggas hungry, when they look at you they see food
Give it up or I see you in the ICU with a bed and some IV's too
Nurse re-teachin' yo ass how to chew
Fuck this rap shit, nigga I got a shoe
Next color on the shelf is North Carolina blue
I'm gettin' married, she from North Carolina too
But you won't catch me in the North Carolina blue
If you see me in Raleigh, just slidin' through
Throw your rags in the air like North Carolinians do
Before you run up, think about what you're tryin' to do
'Cause the 12 gauge eat niggas like piranha food
On my son I push ya head backwards
'Cause I'll never ever ever be the next dead rapper
I'd rather be alive pushin' some 2008 shit
'Cause you gotta be dead in a box to be somebody's favorite
I ain't sayin' I'm about to go where Ma$e went
But you won't find me upside down on the pavement
I'm behind the desk on some Jay shit
Some niggas don't want me to shine, can you say snitch?
Black Wall Street niggas hop out and spray shit
A.K. spit, give that Maybach a face lift
Now back to the basics
My flow so amazin' 
if this was 88 and I could rap, I'd wear you out like Asics
Wear you out like them ugly ass Bape shits
Funny ass jackets got the hood on some gay shit
Them look like Nike's with stars on 'em, face it
The whole world blind, everybody on that Ray shit
Roll a blunt and get higher then a spaceship
Touch The Sky, nigga I'm on that Kanye shit
Back in the day I used to bump Jaz-O
Run up on you, take ya money and ya skateboard, I was a asshole
Now I blast fo', leave 'em on this grass swole
Kickin and Pushin' like Lupe Fiasco
I got a jab like Floyd, even Zab know
Try to Play The Game, get punched out like Glass Joe
Hip-hop cops on my dick, hit the Ave slow
Mad cause I get love in New York, like DiMaggio
Brooklyn niggas say my flow nuts like pistachios
See me in the '64 and wonder why the ass is low
I got them bricks in it, that real yayo
That Tony Montana, drop the shit off the Pedro
I buy guns but the tons, bullets by the case load
We can find Osama when I say so
I got niggas flyin' in from San Diego
That'll smoke your town turn it into Waco
Come through give ya whole hood a makeover
Sit on yo block in the bullet proof Range Rover
Make you fade to black and I ain't Hova
Think about that the next time you say The Game over

You know I usually talk a lot of shit at the end of my mother fuckin' freestyles
But it ain't nobody else left to beef with....

Where you get them Js? Jordan sent those
Got my Glock cocked ‘case a nigga think he fit those
Get his shit blowed, like it’s endo, over them custom kicks though
Heart been cold, hot chain been froze, but it’s plated in gold
Ride around in those
Red Octobers in July, you got 'em, you lie, in red puddles
Peyton Manning with the cannon, nigga no huddle
No rebuttal, when you the king of the square, it’s no trouble
When the city love you
But them haters nigga

My neck's so iced out, my wrists so shined up
I make hoes line up, see a pole, climb up
Brown sugar or light skin, black or white skin
If she could drop it low then she could be my night friend
Or my one night stand, if she got a nice tan
Before I leave I cut the light off of your nightstand
Back to the house, my girl wanna have real sex
Nah, I keep my kids like Britney Spears' ex
Take her back to the future, I ain't even here yet

Stop playin' girl, stop playin'!
Stop playin' girl, stop playin'

California,Purp & Patron: The Hangover,2011.0,"People tryin'
To do what?
To find a way out
Oh yeah, that was me in 2004
Love ain't around
Ain't never been around
Look at California
Yeah, that's right (That's right)
Every time you look at me (Look at me-look at me)
Look at California
You look at California
I am the West side (West side-West side)
Look at Cali-look at Cali-California
Look

Palm tress, beautiful women
Drop-top Phantom, now this is livin'
Started off choppin' crack in my Grandma kitchen
But y'all know that, so let's get down to business
Out of towners beware of what you wear
""Yo, son I'm from New York,"" but we don't care
The Crips, the Bloods, the Eses
The Daytons, the Dubs, the Chefes
What you know about Cali, everything irate
I make the dinner, you be sure to scrape the plate
From Compton's Most to N.W.A
From Snoop Dogg to Dr. Dre, niggas love us
What about the bitches?
You mean these bitches bouncin' in my backseat when my Impala hit switches?
They ridin' with a king, a California king
If it ain't about that, it ain't 'bout a mothafuckin' thing
I'm livin' the American dream, sittin' fat but I don't sing
I don't fuck with rats if you know what I mean
You thinkin' 50 but I'm talkin' Christina Milian
Sucked a million dicks but still ain't sold a million
Bitch tryna get a rock like a milli on
I know you like, ""what this gotta do with L.A.?""
Bitch tried to fuck me and she almost fucked Dre, so

Yeah, slow this shit down, man
I'ma let California fuck you now, yeah
That's right, yeah, how it feel?
Know California niggas got big dicks, big trucks, big mouths, big guns
We'll fuck you all night
Straight R&B, Black Wall Street Records we don't play no games
I mean, after four albums, what the fuck you want from a nigga?
I got the houses here, Miami, condo in New York, condo in Wilshire
I done lived in Beverley Hills
Look down the street at Range Rovers, Bentleys and Phantoms passin' by
As the wind blows through my fuckin' fade
Niggas know what it is with me, nigga
California King and that's for life
Don't give a fuck what a nigga say

Let me introduce ya to somethin' you're not used to
I'm California's future, sit back, watch what I do to
These Dre beats, these Timbaland tracks
I Just Blaze 'em, I spit crack
I Scott Storch 'em, you can't afford 'em
Every hot producer seen Game record
My flow out of this world like Neptune
California was dyin', I came to the rescue
First time Snoop Dogg ever heard me spit
His reply was like, ""Damn, nephew""
That was '05
Now it's '011, four albums, six years, I'm ahead of my time
I let you niggas be LeBron
Even he can't see Kobe in his prime
Picture Kobe and LeBrons, that's too much game, I'm outta my mind
That's a hot line, I think niggas wanna hear me say that one more time
Picture Kobe and LeBrons, that's too much game I'm outta my mind
Outta my soul
Been havin' out of body experiences since I was seven years old
Look at California, he ain't scared
Shot a deuce-five 'fore he had Nike Airs
My pops like, ""There goes the block"", I'm like, ""Where?""
Brass knuckles in my Levi's
, never fight fair
Twenty years later, I'm right here
Red rag wipin' off all white Airs
Let a nigga step on 'em, I'ma go Wyclef on 'em
Could go Raekwon the Chef on 'em
Throwin' up a dub, bangin' Wu-Tang
Ridin' wit' a chopper like a young Hussein
In a new range
Fuck with the Crips but
 
I'm from the P-I-R-U gang
Momma, I did it, you told me to so I spit it
I don't just talk Cali, I lived it
From Aftermath to Sick Wit It
I'm sick wit' it, so, nigga, admit it
You will never be Game, never be Pac, never be Doggy Dogg
I don't know why you spit 'cause, nigga, you ain't shit
You writin' for Detox? Nigga, suck my dick
Me and Hittman did that before
First Mel-Man left and then I seen the trapdoor
Came in through the back, nobody can stop him
Not E-V-E, Busta Rhymes or Rakim
And Bus my nigga, so I would never diss 'em
Fuck over any other rapper with Henny in my system
Who want it? Not Jigga
I'm treacherous like Trigga
I'm Naughty By Nature, nigga
With more priors than Richard
And I can say whatever 'cause I made Jimmy Iovine richer
And he get richer every time I call you a bitch ass nigga
Let Chris Bosch run up on Kobe again
I'ma catch him in the club and open his chin
'Cause I ride or die for this Cali shit
Break a nigga off proper like a Valley bitch
I chop a nigga down like a brick of raw
I'm Notorious like Biggie Smalls
I know he from New York, but he like me
Last thing I wanna do 'fore I D-I-E is
Look at-look at-look at California
Look at-look at-look at California
Look at-look at-look at California
Look at-look at-look at California

I know New York the mecca of hip hop
A-Town stay doin' they thing
Chi-Town breed Kanye and muh' fuckin' Common
Sometimes y'all gotta look at California
Ayo, Jimmy Iovine, tell Dre these headphones the shit",https://genius.com/The-game-california-lyrics
Graveyard,Hoodmorning (No Typo): Candy Coronas,2011.0,"Welcome to the graveyard
Where everybody likes to pray:
Allahu Akbar, you scared to say ""God""?
They call me Game 'cause I play hard
So get your helmets and your face guards
I spit holy water, 
lets have a face off: Nicholas Cage
They say the boy is off the chain like two pits in a cage
Your girl say my flow the bomb like I swallow grenades
Respect the rules up in this shit so you gotta get paid
Or you gotta get sprayed
Like Windex with them twin Tecs, or Raid on top of insects
Niggas die fuckin they family over, where I'm from they call that incest
Open the Bible, the good book serve its purpose for shook crooks
Heavenly Father, I think me in Heaven'll be a good look
Give all these niggas a good Hook

In this heartless world that I live in
I have learned that I can't depend on love
It hasn't made me a cent
So I'ma take it all with me to the graveyard
(With Game) Bury it in the graveyard

The cemetery ain't as new or the saint that it look
They bury ministers there right next to straight crooks
And Nas told niggas they was shootin' and they'd look
Niggas lyin' 'bout bangin', getting whooped on Facebook, aw
Now put that on your wall, I put that on the Wall
I shot-call and ball quicker than John Wall, aw
I'm killin' you niggas
Bought everything last year and wasn't feelin' you niggas
Mean, I was numb last year, wasn't feelin' you niggas
Came back to sell a few more mil on you niggas
Toast! I'm in the Phantom, nah nigga I ain't scared of no ghost
'Cause all the dead rapper's albums are sellin' the most

In this heartless world that I live in
I have learned that I can't depend on love
It hasn't made me a cent
So I'ma take it all with me to the graveyard
(With Game) Bury it in the graveyard

Some say the third verse puts niggas in the hearse
Since I was born Jay, guess I'm The Gift & The Curse
Lot of Bloods out here, but nigga I did it first
Spill blood out here that's why I'm up in the church
Still repenting for my sins, but not all the way
Cause I just rode up in the Benz and handed homie the K
What he 'gon do with it? Prolly 'gon run up on your crew with it
That's what I call rap beef, lucky I'm through with it
Now I just lean back, '72 with it
Sell it to a nigga down south, he act a fool with it
Back to them haters and them stool pigeons
You too busy tryna judge us stars, but how are you livin'?

In this heartless world that I live in
I have learned that I can't depend on love
It hasn't made me a cent
So I'ma take it all with me to the graveyard

That's why when I drop shit
They jump on it
Like dicks they love it
Homo niggas
Choke when the game on the line
Dallas Cowboy Romo niggas
I got more bitches, more digits
07 I'm hitting more switches
Hip-hop broke, I'm gon fix it
I been away for a minute
I was in Europe on tour
Now I'm back, bonjour
The flow is so pure
I was baptized by the Doug E Fresh's
Lost my way and got reckless
Too much beefin' Had me screwed up like Texas
So I had to take em back to the '98 Lexus
Take the grill out for dinner
Chop the crack for breakfast
It's a million niggas like me
Red strings in they Nike's
Some official, some softer than Scott's tissue
That's life B
Deal with it
Carry the steel with it
If you hard peel with it
One dome shot if you real with it
I'm from Compton son
Aim at a target and I will hit it
Cocaine Game
Put red sauce on ya Bills fitted
See me in the streets
I'm probably holdin' some
Beverly Hills
Spending money like I'm Oprah's son
That's why the bitches feel me
And they baby daddy's wanna kill me
Run up on the Range
Fucking with Game
He gon bang
Picture ya bleedin'
All stretched out
Barely breathin'
Huffin' and wheezin'
As the Range Rover tires screechin'
I've been
Coached by the OGs
Chased by the police
You ain't never seen a nigga
Hit a fence like me
Catch me If you can
Leonardo DiCaprio
They say I'm not a real blood
The hood is backin' me though
Niggas like Deebo, White Boy, Fog and Knot
Ask Big Dan if young Game
Jogged the block
Hog the rock
Sell it if it's hard or not
Before they call the cops
I rip apart the block
I'm in the bathroom flushing
Out the window, Hit the back gate
Tomorrow guess what?
I'm at the same corner hustlin
I done sold weed, sold X, sold crack
Never been snitched on
Cause I ain't ever ran with no rats
Never left ma grandma house
Without loading both straps
Never fumbled runnin' like Barry Sanders
Know that
I vow to hustle til there's no more crack
Indirectly, got a young nigga to fold those packs
The black Jim Hoffa
Lemme introduce you to the show stopper
Mr. Lamborghini driver, low-Pro copper
He is I and I am he
We are one like the moon and the sun
OG
I been around
Kid hustlin
With grown men around
Seen homies get shot
And watch bodies spin around
Ain't hardly from Marcy
But I gotta respect it
Got niggas there
Chi town
And Mo-Town
I'm well-connected
Get your body dropped off
Any town I please
Let the trap snap on the rat
You'll die eating cheese
Get on your knees
Pray for Harry-O, Kenneth Supreme
I pledge allegiance to the hustlers
Keep livin' ya dream
What?
Ayo Skee man, shit is too easy
Ya know what I'm sayin?

Not when you want it, when the fuck we feel like it

: Aw, pimpin' that's the Young Gunz, I love the Young Gunz
: Shit, me too nigga
: Wait a minute
: The fuck
: Pimpin', what did that nigga just say?
: I don't know, playa
: Play that again
: Alright

So have that money right, and we don't mess with the funny type
Fake ass pimps like Money Mike
: What the fuck, nigga, punk ass bitch
: Let me check my palm pilot, give me that fool, it's a full time pimp mode

Chris and Neefy, I'm warnin' you sweetie
Y'all can't beat me, you'll see when you meet me
I'ma say it real clear so you niggas understand
Fuck the Young Gunz and both of your fans
Somebody in your camp should've told you to stop it
Now you two rappers gettin' fucked by a comic
I done been to New York, you niggas ain't a factor
How does it feel to get dissed by an actor
And y'all can't really diss a nigga at all
I made one fuckin' movie, I'm more famous than y'all
And it'll take more than some Young Gunz to hurt me
I put your momma on the stroller, bitch ain't but 30
Y'all just got moustaches, how you gon' burn me
Two young gay versions of Bert and Ernie
You don't concern me cause y'all ain't hot
Y'all the only girl group Roc-A-Fella got
Matter fact just don't say my name no more
And try to keep your CD out the 99 cent store

Cause you can't stop won't stop, two weak mothafuckas
Who just need to sit down 'fore you get the fuck clowned
And if I see you around, I'ma pimp slap you down
And then leave in my Gators without makin' a sound

Y'all really helped me out, but y'all ain't knowin'
Hey, Chris tell Neefy his thong is showin'
You need to be signin' to Nickelodeon, you the Children's Choice
Next time you say my name put some bass in your voice
Mr. Carter is a pimp that's why he's got the Roc
And got you two young bitches sellin' cock on the block
You can't stop cause you never started
And both of y'all niggas sound plain retarded
Why did y'all get pimpin' started
Two young girls that still get carded
One of y'all sucks and the others garbage
It ain't no secret it's common knowledge
I could've let you slide but I'm too cold-hearted
And I hope you mad enough to realize this
You just got slapped by a fake ass pimp

: Shh... I just put the kids to sleep, shh...
: Time to wake they punk ass up

Can't stop, won't stop, Game sittin' outside
In the stock Range, loadin' a clip while Pac playin'
Since he wanna drop names, I'ma tie him up
Leave him ass naked in the 'hood with his Roc chain
When I pull the death card, your whole crew'll fold
The bullets I throw'll have my Eagles in the Superbowl
You don't want me put the fifth to your chest
Watchin' lil Neefy scramble like ""Vic get the tech""
From 40 yards away, oh shit he can catch
Slugs like bikini wax the way they stick to his chest
Yup, I make the savage come out
And ain't no tellin' what the yappin' about before the plastic come out
Blood comin' out the back of your mouth
Unless you take Money Mike' name and put it back in your mouth
Only thing left of you is the ash in your house
You lookin' for a young gun bring Cassidy out
Bitch
: Yo, Mike kick 'em, man. Still asleep
: I-I can't even do it, nigga, I
: Naw, nigga you gotta kick 'em, man, I'm tellin' you I do this shit all the time, man, we put niggas to sleep, we kick 'em, that wake 'em up, man
: I know, but I just wanna see 'em resting there for a second
: Naw man, go find a mo' fuckin' ouija board or somethin', nigga and we gon', we gon' put the little thing on it, on the C and on the N and we gon' see if Chris and Neef wake they faggot ass up, kick 'em, man
: I'm just sayin' out of all the niggas for me to get dissed by it would have to be the two weakest rappers in the history of all rap
: I'm sayin', nigga, you can kick 'em while I'm right here, nigga, it ain't gon' be nothin', nigga
: Okay, I'ma kick 'em one time
: Kick 'em
: This a hard-toe Gator too
: Come on, kick 'em man, right in the ass
: Oh, that felt nice
: Damn

: Go get a pap smear

Fresh like, unhh; Impala, unnh
Crome hyrdolics, 808 drums
You don't want, none

Pistol grip, pump
If a nigga step on my white air 1s
Since red, rum
Ready here I, come

Whole gang in the front in case a nigga wanna, stunt

Rich folks do not want me around

Somebody gon' get laid the fu** out
They call me new money, say I have no class
I'm from no bottom, I came up too fast
The hell if I care, I'm just here to get my cash
Bougie ass bitch, you can kiss my ass
(Hook)
(Verse III - Game)
I put gold Daytonas on that Cherry Six-Four
White walls so clean it's like I'm ridin on bulbs
Hit one switch mang, that a** so low

Back to the studio, turn it up, back to makin' them hits
I got two sons, two guns, used to beef with these two bums
Thought about lettin' off two shots to watch his crew run
Contimplated puttin' money on they head but it's just rap
Hit Nas, he told me ""don't get down like that""
It's time to strategize, fuck bitches have 'em feed me grapes
But all I could do is think about this 40 eatin' your face
You mothafuckas just don't know how the beef was erased
I ain't call him, he called Jeezy, Jeezy called so we straight
For now, but I still got one brow to the ceilin'
And a loaded Glock .45 that's ready for peelin'
I make a call, more killin', you make it out, Lord willin'
See life is a card game and I'm the mothafuckin' dealer
I see you, where the killas? See your chain, where the millions
Walk with me, I'll show you where Benjamin Franklin is livin'

Cough up a lung, where I'm from
Compton son, ain't nothin' nice

I fuck with the Kayslays the Clues, Drama the DJ Poohs
Whether or not they fuck with me, I'm like Jay I will not lose
Been winnin' since the beginning, before Dre, before my records was spinnin'
I was down in that chowls fuckin' the finest women
Ask your favorite R&B bitches, pick one
Any one, I dicked 'em, never licked 'em, she looked good till she spit cum
Used to bang her like a kick drum, she'd be screamin' and shit
Yellin' my name, just think ten years back I was dreamin' this shit
Thinkin' 'bout whippin' a sports car, you know the Beamer is sick
Blowin' out the sunroof, gangsta leanin' and shit
Maybe I'm trippin' cause gangbangin' was all I knew
Grew up in a Crip neighborhood used to wanna be Snoop
After my brother died I could've swore I would end up in blue
Whoever knew young Jay would turn out to be a Piru
Stole a red rag from the liquor store and started a crew
Where gangbangin' is just somethin' to do
Mothafuckas


I'm from where the old people say ""put your gat away"" and they bang Donny Hathaway
And the O.G.'s is trippin' cause lil niggas ain't wear they rag today
Same 'hood where Game good
See yellow tape and white chalk where the lames stood, all the news reporters blame Suge
Some niggas ain't from here and need a ghetto pass to come here
Where Old English is more than just a dumb beer
Grew up across the tracks but I been on this side for some years
Witnessed too much pain to tattoo it all in one tear
Some niggas move away and never ever come back
They say Compton died with Eazy, guess who bringin' it back
No disrespect to other rappers I just made it here first
Inverse my verse you silly mothafuckas makin' it worse",https://genius.com/The-game-where-im-from-compton-lyrics
Dead,Purp & Patron,2011.0,"This for my nigga C-Murder, locked away
This for the nigga conscious that took Pac away
This for the niggas scheming on me but not today
This for the niggas thinking' I was all Dr. Dre
This for the magazine writers with a lot say
Come to my hood it ain't no good we cock and spray
Keep it gully like we out at fall Rockaway
Treat gangsta rap like it's a hood spot for yay
Come through the hood with a model chick that I got from 'Ye
And rose Phantom limitage just a block away
So let the beat knock while you bob your head
I switch cars jump in the C.L., smoother than Pete Rock
Air Max 95, flow classic like Reebok
Remember O1, try lay me down like shirak
R.I.P to all them niggas and all my niggas

Don't Don't End Up dead
Nigga Don't Don't up Dead

One thing about me
Always keep it real with myself
Like Nas, I'm Ill Will with myself
And I can feel the pain of Ms. Wallace
I wish Chris was here
, 
so he could see C.J. blow
Like the paint on this Impala
Tell Afeni to holla if she need another son that rap
Pac's revenge
 and I got a gun that clap, like Dr. Dre snares
Blow chronic like Dr. Dre cares
I been there, done that
Dr. Dre shares all his bitches and his liquor
He ain't call me for Detox, but that's my nigga
Remember who brought 'em back to Compton
The 23 year old me was a fuckin' monsters
Still niggas say I ain't hood what fuck they talk' about
Like I won't kiss my sons on the heads and chuck em out
What up 50? let's talk it out
But until we talk it out


I remember when my older brother wanted to be Rakim
Now I'm livin' his dream, cause somebody shot him
And left me like Eric B. without Rakim
Still payed them for like B.B.S. stock rims
Now I got California locked in
Dip in this Beamer, same model, different year they shot Pac in
So whats the ""Top 10"" if you dead
Who drop this Lamborghini if I'm in the feds
To times feeling spelling my nights up in the bed
But I'm from Compton so when I'm out its Infrared
Get my son ready for school and I kiss his head
So when you see my face in the mirror
If I end up dead bed
Never wore bullet proof vest and no got bullet proof Car

Yo I'm nothing like something nice, fuck a fight

Duck and dodge under cars so cops don't see my stupid ass
Jibber this, jabber that, I'm clickin' this, clackin' that
Hittin' this, jackin' that, gettin' this, stackin' that
I make movies, killer shit, action packed
Realer shit, gat for gat, thriller shit, Jackson pack
You play if you dare, this 80 gon' flare
Rock and recline you like a Lazy Boy chair
Ligaments damaged and need to get repaired again
Good thing my bullets come with free shipment and handlin'
Money back guaranteed if he don't die at the scene
Hundred cash guaranteed if he don't drop at the scene
I'm natural born, from the gravel up on
I get gate, these stakes keep rattlin' on
I'm a don, plus I know how to calm sluts
A lil cock and a snap on fat from Von Dutch
I'm the cappuccino and I ain't talkin' Starbucks
No hot coffee, drop off me

Red rag in my back pocket
'63 Continental, suicide doors, black mask, black topic
Santana in the cockpit, rearview mirror, bandana tied in a knot and
Coke in the grill, hundred spokes in the wheels, nigga I'm stuntin'
White Air 1's and I'm still a hundred miles and runnin'
They gunnin' for nothin', they missin' so I'm still livin'
Dope game too hot, MTV can't come to my kitchen
I'm still pitchin', Dre don't know that I'm on the block hustlin'
Engineers find work in the studio, shhh... they don't say nothin'
I'm sprayin', you bluffin', I'm laughin', you sufferin'
Your man at the precinct talkin' on tape like Teddy Ruxpin
We do heavy shufflin', leave you in black tuxes
Jim Jones and Cam'ron, Harlem and Compton, we like Blood cousins
On 24's, rubbin', so what the whores love it
Eagle on your chest like the Byrd Gang, nigga fuck it
Wall Street and Dipset, I plead the fifth

You know some tried to kill me, they better run, how silly
Cause I come with the goons, you can call me One-Eye Willy
It's gonna take some endurance, I had cases in courts
And I was facin' some warrants, almost got lost in the wave of the current
And my killers is heartless, so quick to fill up a cartridge
And my gorillas will get you, I give a fuck if you send Mandela to squash it
Manhandlin' Porsches, and we set up with thugs
We flip up in clubs, all you see is bandanas and gang members in porches
Car jackin', the weed is raw, big ass when we leave on tour
So pull gas we don't believe the law, the first rise on the Reigal law
We got government issues, they got us in ghettos, we thuggin' with pistols
We pourin' out liquor to thugs, we miss you
We sendin' our love on a dub, hope it reach you
The snub or the Eagle, hit the block and grudge like I'm evil
Westside where them techs fly, Cedar Block, showin' love to my people
Chuck Taylor's and khakis, Chuck Taylor, he's bracky
Three of the ghetto's most wanted, hustle like sailors on Trackspeed
Fuck about jails and patackies, you uppin' our sales in the crack feed

If I can't get you I'm fucking Lloyd Banks up
You know nigga look at my face
I told you not to mess with my gangsta
I swear to God I told him Mase
Prayin on my downfall since I came up
Young Buck, Olivia ain't safe
You told us that Ja Rule was a wanksta
Yayo, I'm Outside your place
Now the whole G-Unit camp is in danger
It's The Game, nigga look at my face

First things first motherfucker, stop tellin them lies
It's easy to stretch the truth now that Hommo died
In front of your grandma's house, right outside
Nigga ran up on yo' shit and let off nine
And Fifty knows homicide let off nine
You ain't die cuz you only got shot 3 times
1 in the jaw, two in's and out's
He was screaming that's why they knocked his teeth out
I've seen your medical reports you phony homie
Look me in the eye's I tried to warn you homie
A coward dies a thousand deaths in his vest
I'll give you six more slugs, you can add to the rest
Till' everybody from NY wanna be from the west
Kiss my converse bitch and take your last breath
Cuz that G-Unit shit ain't gonna last
You could sign Jesus Christ, he couldn't save your ass


I took a trip to Connecticut, I was lurking with the Glock
Mad cuz Sha Money had me working with the cops
You 5-0 nigga, that your name
Where I come from 5-0, that's some change
When your first album came out you left out some things
You get low like Bleek
 when them ratchets bang
Mase step inside the confessional booth
You turned your back on God, the devil got you spooked
You ain't Murder shit, you don't even got your own block
Takin orders from a snitch, who sleep with cops
And Little Curtis always lookin for a scam to pull
You ain't the real 50 Cent, you ""Sammy The Bull""
You got shot in the mouth once you still talkin' shit

Play tough but they whole fuckin' life made up
I'm start wit 50 'cause I used to roll wit him
He never smoked weed so how could I blow wit him
Should knew he was a fag by the way his clothes fit him
Tight G-Unit jeans brought out the ho in him
Had one lil girlfriend and that was fixed
Somebody must told Vivica her boyfriend like dick
Lloyd Banks knew, he told me that shit
I told Buck and Buck told me he's ridin' wit his clique
So I start ridin' wit Fat Joe and Kiss
Made a good choice 'cause after that Yayo bricked
So I gave away my chain and decided to keep movin'

Chicken Little killed you niggas you'll never bounce back
I paid 19 dollars to see that shit
My bitch said you was naked I ain't see that shit
You and Olivia in the shower, my bad that was Terrence Howard
A lil Hustle & Flow and a damn coward
I had to sit there for 80 minutes
The best actor in the movie was the baby in it
This ain't New Jack City and it can't be Menace
The worst actor in the world, you made the Guinness
I made G-Unot and that made you finished

Young nigga up outta Compton mayne, y'knahmsayin?
This 2002, we gon' see what it do mayne
Y'knahmean? Yarra

Now everybody wanna know the truth about a nigga named Game
I come from the hub and every ghetto ain't the same
A lot of people already know exactly where it's at
Cause it's the home of the jackers and the crack
(Compton!) Yeah that's the name of my hometown
I'm goin down, in the town, where my name is all around
A nigga just be hatin and shit, that's a pity
But I ain't doin nuttin but claimin my city

Where they actin a fool, and they carry the tool
Them sick dudes in the streets of Compton
Where I found The Game, he was stackin his change
To maintain in the streets of Compton
Took a trip to the Sco, got low for the dough
In Fillmoe from the streets of Compton
Now we stackin the bread, never run from the feds
They shed treads in the streets of Compton

See my lyrics are double or nothin provin to suckers I can throw 'em
Pass the natural 10 to 4 and six-eight before I go
Not really into freestylin, or tryin to promote violence
But they gotta know about the five-five-fo', so
That's how I'm livin, I do as I please B
A young gangsta put in work on these Cali streets
And everybody know, that you gotta be stompin
If you're born and raised in Compton


Nowww Compton is a place, where all my niggas chill dog
'til I found out, the streets get real dog
'Bout a year ago, somebody musta wanted me to die
Cause they kicked in the door, and gave the young kid five
They musta thought that I was gon' play the bitch role
Cause I lived through fo' five six holes
But I ain't goin out like no faggot-ass clown
They found, they couldn't keep a gangsta nigga down
So here's the burner in your face motherfucker silly sucker
Ass clucker now you're duckin cause you can't stop a Y.G
Gangsta, cause I'm true to my game
You're lame, and thangs ain't gon' never be the same
Cause a nigga like the Game is takin over
I really don't think I should have to explain
Oh yeah I'm a dog but my name ain't Rover
And I'm the kinda nigga that's feelin no pain
Sometimes I have to wear a bulletproof vest
Because I got the C-P-T style written across my chest
A gangsta motherfucker never ceasin to impress
My name is young Game so you can fuck, the rest
I'm comin like this and I'm comin directly
Cause niggas gettin all stirred up, I'm doin damage quite effectively

For one reason, we ain't living to kill niggas, just dieing to sleep
I'm in the hood and I ain't wear a vest
Push a stock GTO, with a pump in the seat and a desert eagle in the head rest

Im from the CPT, where niggas dieing to eat
Them niggas with scars under they left eye and they cheek
Park a 745 on your street
Like mother fucker if you don't ride with me, you can die with the enemy
Or die like the Kennedy's nigga
I empty desert clips out like a bottle of Hennessy nigga

I got niggas that'll beef for the game
Run up on your man, splat his brain then bring you his chain
So if you owe my hood, you better pay up
I roll with killas, that'll put you in a hole like a lay up
Ain't no sleep on the block, my niggas stay up
Cause they ain't trying to miss sales
They trying to tip over fish scales
Be in the XXL, and its only 6 street rappers if you wanna be real
That go for the whole industry you bitch ass niggas
Say my name in a verse if you ready to die
I call up my Harlem niggas on the i95
10 minutes later you dead on the I95
Aftermath mother fucker, we ain't playing this shit
50, work ride, Joe, Cube, the Game and Em
Its our house and we in the front yard
So fuck with the Dr. and get picked apart like junk yards",https://genius.com/The-game-ride-or-die-lyrics
Troublesome,West Coast Resurrection,2005,"I'm too gangsta for the streets, watch me when I creep
I put five in your Jeep, leave a nigga sleep
Now you six feet deep over bullshit
Got a mac-10 mouth, ain't never pull shit
The ghetto don't make G's, it mold niggas, get down or lay down
Like Beanie Mac told niggas or meet the fo'-fo' nigga
I let them guns blow, nigga I'm a rider
Thug Life 'til I die, Black Wall Street behind us
I'm a Menace to Society, fuck Caine and O Dog
I got the 'caine and the O's, dawg
I'm gangsta like Hennessy and Alize, Thug Passion
Ride or die 'til they kill me or put me in ""Thugz Mansion""
Gangbangin, this California lifestyle got me heated
They want me buried, so I don't leave without the Desert Eagle
Shoot first, ask questions on my way to county jail
Kill a nigga over my chain cause I know I'mma make bail
I'm troublesome

If I die tonight, bury me a G amongst rap legends
Cause I spit bullets in rhymes, 16's and 9's
I keep a vest and a weapon, my baby momma got me stressin
Prayin on my knees every night askin God is there a heaven?
So here is my confession to my unborn child
Them five shots couldn't drop me, but I ain't take 'em and smile
I lost a lot of my niggas to gangbangin and digits
One figure on the trigger dawg I live the life of a sinner
These motherfuckers wanna see me doin life in the pen
I'm a Outlaw, and the West coast is ridin again
My competition is none, I'm on a mission with guns
Starin death in the eyes, 20 niggas deep when we ride
My enemies is bitches, they plottin on my riches
Can't walk in the streets without the paparazzi takin pictures
Label me a made nigga, all the way from Compton to Boston
These niggas keep talkin I leave 'em dead in a coffin
I'm troublesome

Money over bitches is my motto in the streets I'm known for catchin hollows
Packin pistols and drinkin Belve and Grey Goose out the bottle
No role models, only killers and fiends
Witness my nigga strapped with gats and army fatigues
If it's murder he wrote it, if I'm lyin let the XXL quote it
And know that I'm strictly a rap poet
Baptized in my own tears, chastized by my own peers
I'm a product of my childhood years
My mother told me I'm HOPELESS, my pops wasn't around
One of the reasons why I'm clutchin the pound
California dreamin, chronic smoke out the beamer
One hand on the nina schemin got these hooptie bitches screamin
They know that I'm celebrity, keep them cop killers in the clip
And watch my back is what my niggas keep tellin me
21 years old, no felonies, so I ride with the Desert
And pay homage to the hardest rap legend
I'm troublesome",https://genius.com/The-game-troublesome-lyrics

I'mma flip white on the block till I get life in the box
Or till I get ice from a shot
But till then, it's chill gems, ice in the watch
And yes nigga, we the best nigga, like it or not
Cause ya'll be writin' dead weight like you got a red cape
When the 8 blast, ya fake ass be scared straight
I'll rush on ya set, then cut you to death
Get it right, knife stuck in ya neck
Man you got two options cut me a check
Or stuck on the vest before you get bucked in the chest
I squeeze till nothin' is left
You'll get banged in the head with revolvers like russian roulette
Ya'll doin' a lot of talkin', I'm tired of talkin'
Ya bout to hear tires screeching and iron sparkin
When the heater pop, look who totin' a sig
And it'll open ya lid like a sneaker box
If I creep you ock, I'mma spray ya way
In all black, like agent jay look this pay me day
I need that, get ya spleen clapped
I'll make you bleed where you breathe at


My name is V-I to the R-U-S
In a new S, Glock and a new vest
And a tre pound bout to lay down
A new set, cooperate
Or I'm poppn 8 leave his crew wet
Shit I'mma true vet, you don't want trouble see
Cuz ma name got buzz like a bumble bee
I hustle see, pounds of the white lady
Institution flow, everything I write crazy
I like gravy nigga, so I'm seein checks
My dough mean, I grow green like chia pets
See the rest say my name out they fuckin' lips
Like I ain't word in the streets, like I ain't fuckn cyss
These fuckin' pricks gonna learn to respect me
Or the burner leave em burned where your chest be
Burned in a nestlee, green herbal, nigga my green purple
When I zone, that chrome with the beam murk you
You need a O, see me, I get em cheap
My fiends be missin' teeth like ODB
But see this ain't bite, this a O-Z from C-Y
Smoke it and C-Y you might O-D, you see
I'm survivin' in the jungle, spittin shottas
So a nigga gettin' bodied ain't suprisin' in the jungle
But, I'mma dam rida, I'm bout a dam dolla
You need somethin' to smoke, give me a dam holla
That tan product got it poppin' for the ?
Smoke so good have the fiends knockin at the door
Cockin' back the 4, pop out noise
I play the block but watch out for the hop out boys
Shit, 5-0 drive by slow, the sig pomet
Can't fuck wit pigs, somethin' like islamics
All I know is schemin' for cash, heaters and mags
All dat shit I learned, they ain't teach in a class
It started from wit an ounce in a house
I was runnin shop, make sure they had it in
And make sure they come an' cop
I'm wanted ock, fight guys wild
When I'm the one with the gun with the cyclops eye
Bet somethin' ock, if you bet nothin' pop
Beef like sex, be strapped and catch somethin' hot
I'm that wise, that's why I wear the mag
F-Y-I, I'm too deep to get compared to Cass


If you owe me, don't come wit half my cheese
Cuz this 3-5-7 be the mag I squeeze
For the chips I got chicks to come bag ma weed
No joke I smoke till I look half Chinese, nigga
And ma eyes is about to shut, bent off a dub of haze
And a choclate dutch
I'll pop ya guts, leave ya bent ova bleedin'
I'mma boss, the dogs that I sent over squeezin'
I can get ya house clapped up, get ya spouse snatched up
So pop, fly and get ya, mouth smacked up
Act tuff in my pants where I'm tuckin the torches
Still big, kill kids like fuckin' abortions
Ock, I'm on the block servin' that wet fever
O you smoke? One toke, we makin' 'em catch seizures

Why you niggas tryna be like everybody else?
And who the fuck I’m supposed to call when I need some help?
Nobody, I just play the cards that I was dealt
Say you niggas don’t feel my pain
Frustrated with the shit that come with money, causin’ fame
Baby momma on the phone, lil brother on the otha' line
I ain’t seen him in a minute, I just need a lil time
I been out here on this grind, tryna make if for my fam
And at the same time, show my mother I’m a man
I been on my shit goin’ hard in the studio
I know they say it’s takin’ long, at least this shit is movin’ though
Pray for me, I’mma make it the right way
I'm way different than these niggas, talkin’ night and day
I was taught to have patience
Now let you let you know what’s ready for you, it’s waitin'

Real niggas be theyself, they neva switch the roads
Fake niggas keep fakin’ till they get exposed
Uh, it’s like we all work the same dreams
But we different, so we don’t deserve the same things
I’m just tryna turn a verse into a million
Without a beach, ya know, just say some shit these niggas feelin’

Niggas know pops and if they don’t check the screen near
Niggas don’t trip on my niggas bout that bid'ness
Bitch tested and proved it, grabbed a choppa and use it
Pop the violence and use it, to make us wild out and lose it
As if you dooders recruited, yeah, we was raised up to do it
Tryna survive through the struggles
Some people didn’t make it through it
I guess that’s why I smoke so much, it keep me goin’

He was right I traded the coupe and got me a range, no ice to black diamonds in my black wall chain
You know I'm gonna ride and ain't shit change
But the right to claim both sides (east side west side!)

It's only been 12 months I lost a few friends
Had my baby mama bust the windows out of my bens
Hip hop police on me every city I'm in, well hell, me and low dipping again
3 wheel motion chrome spokes on the rims
Run up on us watch that.38 revolver spin
I'm rich game bitch I made a few mill now the 64 impala got a Paul Wall grill
They say I moved out the hood I ain't keeping it real so I took the projects back and put it on top of the hill
I'm hungry, still rap like I ain't got no deal, you can pop that cristal but nigga I pop steel
I'm going diamond I put that on my unborn child
I'm almost dead I ran 99 miles
Bitches they used to diss me they feeling me now they say I rap like I'm from New York and they like my style

This can be the day you get richer or this can be the day you try
This can be the day you walk away or this can be the day you die

Yeah motherfucker you hear my shit in the club when you do know 9 out of 10 times I'm in the club
Stop fucking with cristal I can't pay that price
I take a 20.40 ounces and a bucket of ice
Pour it on my niggas now they flooded with ice
Niggas hate me to mu death cuz I'm loving my life
I can walk through any hood I payed that cost
I ait'n felt disco since I got shot in the hearth
27 years old put the tell on the porsche 27 covers from double xl to the source
Dr. dre choose me to cary the torch
I spit cuz the D.O.C lost his voice

Plus I'm your motherfucking faggot father
Plus I'm a fucking faggot that fucks you and laughs it off till I'm fucking your asthma problem
And that's some drastic motherfucker karma so pop an acid tab
Cause that's exactly what's up with you fucking faggots, you punk
To your fucking statements covered by these fucking magazines
All perked in our basements, til cunts just think that nothing matters
And you're wasted and smack the fuck out Rihanna
Guess that's what you get for your slut persona
That's what the world wants, a girl cunt that talks about how much she wants to 
I'm about to blow my motherfucking brains out
Because it's cool, cause it's true, plus I want someone to fucking listen
And this is pretty much the only way you'll pay attention
Which is retarded if you think about it. But why think about it?
Why just knock it off your rocker, fuckin' drink and shout at
What's wrong with the world so you can learn some shit you think is outlet
Slit your wrist to it, listen to Chris' music
Keep pumpin' your fuckin' fist to this bullshit
Piss on the flag that has nurtured you
Offend your rights, persecute, do some dumb shit
Loose on the run from the fuckin' law that shoot your guns at
Cause you're the fuckin' gangster you claim to be aren't you?
Too fuckin' dangerous and harmful for just one statement or lawsuit
This money and label's painted across you

No more sunshine cause the rain is back
Flow Shady, niggas like I can't be black
I'm the cocaine of rap, the dope game is back
My lyrics dress like Mos Def, I bring the 80's back

Young Buck, when your album comin' out?
Naw, for real, go ask 50 when your album comin' out
You niggas fightin' over airtime
It's my fault that he pushed your album back farther than Clyde Drexler hairline
Creep up on your tour bus, pull out the pump
Word from Cashville, you ain't been down south in months
You got money in the bank? I'll tell you what I think - you're broke
What you gon' do when 50 stop payin' your car notes?
And the nigga Paul Wall take his grill back
Gotta go back to Nashville, you gon' feel that
David, this ain't' no butterknife Dre shit
This is one shot, kill, ask him where his face went
Now back to the basics, you niggas stuck in the Matrix
Before the nigga finished the G-Unit logo I erased it
So face it Freddy, you'll never see Jayceon
A year and a half later, still looking for my replacement

When Game in this bitch
It's goin' down man
Try to play me out, but you out of bounds, man
Where your goons at, when I come around man?
Banks, Yayo, and Buck is runnin' from the Sound Scan

She Want To Have My Baby,California Republic,2012.0,"Everybody fucking Amber Rose

SMH. TTM. Five star
We be em. LOL, hi my BBM ain't got my BBM

Got some college hoes that wanna smoke a Swisher Sweet with him
They ain't no Lauren Londons but they got that Meagan Goode
They use that photo shot to get their ass above the hood
And its all good when us niggas mayne
I said its all good cause I am a triggerman
Yeah, she said she wanna have Jayceon kid
I told that bitch you better off with Jason Kidd

I do it cause they love it
If you hate it bitch who give a fuck, I made it
Plus I do it for the ladies
Somebody say they wanna have my baby
She said she wanna have my baby
Who tryna have my baby?
She said she wanna have my baby
Tryna have my baby
How many bitches in the club just trying to fuck a platinum rapper
Poking microscopic holes into the magnum wrappers
Hopping on the dick but I ain't throwing carrots at ya
You ain't gonna Worldstar me, I ain't your average rapper
You drinking all the Goose & bitch I ain't fittna pay
You don't look like your Twitter avatar any way
Bitch you look like an Avatar anyway
And thats the same bitch that was stalking Fab, ain't it Tre?
And this is how I know you giving free head
If you was getting paid the bottom of your shoe would be red
But it ain't, she claiming she a saint
But as soon as she sees Dwight she going hard in the paint
Girlfriend-type you wanna take home
Throw a little Drake on, it really shouldn't take long
Then she told me she want me & Tre Songz
I told that bitch ""strip, and start singing all Tre's songs""

I do it cause they love it
If you hated bitch fuck cause I made it
I do it for the ladies
Somebody say they wanna have my baby
She said she wanna have my baby
I am trying to have my baby
She said she wanna have my baby
I am trying to have my baby

You look much better than your friend
Just for the night let me be your boyfriend
With that baby, let's go
Ain't no sense in waiting on me
Nobody that I know, they don't be debating on it
They gon' say we did it, even though we didn't
I'mma play cool, interviews, say I didn't
Mr steal your girl!
Looking for your girl?
Looking for a night out and they both came back to me

Live my life so illegal
We go right at your people
See no evil, I
We do or die

When will you niggas ever learn
That time is money, and money get your ass burned
Learn from the niggas that did it before I had a chance
You know the ones with the Chucks and the khaki pants
Used to tell me all the time ""Bang, lil man""
Took your advice, now my life is a pair of dice
Havin' it, ghetto fabulous
Established since 1992


Straight out the mothafuckin' county jail with my blues on
G-Unit shoes on, baby momma on the way
Jump in the Regal, throw Snoop on
Back to the 'hood to get my mothafuckin' gin and my juice on
It ain't been too long cause Dub still got spinners on the 'Lac
And half on the dub sack
If you smokin' the Henny then pass it to the left
If you ain't got nothin' on it homie you smokin' stress
Niggas see me and wanna bang they 'hood
I don't know why when half you niggas is scared of Suge
Nigga I put it down for my mothafuckin' 'hood
With my niggas WC and Snoop Eastwood
I'm surrounded by legends, Westcoast rap veterans
And we bangin' Tha Pound and Westside Connection
'64 Chevy when I wheelie off the block
It's still 187 on a mothafuckin' cop


Yeah, follow me, it's time, let the hog's eat
WC-izzle, Dogg Pound and Black Wall Street
Three niggas ready to ride, get bandanas in pocket
And we keep the party jumpin' like 'draulics
Gangsta shit, I was raised off that, off 'Gnac
And go back like suade golf hats
I don't spit fire, I spit terror
From the Loco Jams army of this sport, so we the gangbang era
Ain't no other identical, I'm one of the most original
With this gun and pencil when I bang South Central
I represent Swang, I don't rep no coast
Cause niggas ain't willin' to die like I'll die for most
I'm ten years plus in the game and ain't fallen off my hustle
And I keep a fresh pair of busta knuckles
WC bitch, I been rich and still ride in the Regal
And I'm fly as a mothafuckin' eagle
Niiiia

Dogg Pound!

So High,The West Coast Blokk Monster,2008.0,"Man I get so high
Can you imagine how fast the weed go
Take two puffs then pass
Pull out another sack so we can roll that

It ain't nothin' like that purple haze or that chocolate Thai
Switchin lanes with my knee cause I roll it while I drive
And I be blowin that sticky green out the S5
That California kush increase these bitches sex drive
I know that, so I be rollin' up the best lye
Open my sack niggas can smell it down in Bed-Stuy
In LA, niggas they say my shit is that good
In New York, niggas be rollin' up them backwoods
Niggas crowd around me for miles to see me roll up chronic
I take the 'belve with the goose and mix it up with the tonic
I can't see her through the smoke but I can tell that she want it
Take two puffs and pass wake me up in the mornin'
Cause' there ain't nothin' like smokin' while you gettin' some head
Break it down on the chronic album call it breakfast in bed
So mary jane let me know if you wit' it
They say weed is like pussy, you never know how good it is 'till you hit it

Man I get so high
Can you imagine how fast the weed go
Take two puffs then pass
Pull out another sack so we can roll that
Man I get so high
Can you imagine how fast the weed go
Take two puffs then pass
Pull out another sack so we can roll that

I like my weed purple, fluffy just like a pillow
You smoke a little I love to fill up the cigarillo
Outta' control mane a different mode mane
Outta' my body I feel like I'm on soul plane
Don't ask me how high baby I'm on cloud nine
And I'mma be smokin and burnin untill I damn die
Passin it with my people smokin it like its legal
Me and AR higher than two bald eagles
I got some blue weed straight from Africa
Too high to drive so I gotta play the passenger
That shit'' damage you, mark it on your calendar
Everyday is 420 baby I need the cannabis
I smoke a 8th a day, I smoke the pain away
I smoke on sunny days and I smoke on rainy days
I'm in love with it, I'm in the club wit it
Don't pollute the air just put a dub in it

Man I get so high
Can you imagine how fast the weed go
Take two puffs then pass
Pull out another sack so we can roll that
Man I get so high
Can you imagine how fast the weed go
Take two puffs then pass
Pull out another sack so we can roll that

Man I be smokin' on that Bobby Brown and I go pound for pound
Roll it up in a swisher cause' that's how I get down
And I'm blowin' garcia Vegas when I'm out of town
And I don't smoke that much because I'm out of town
And know that because I'm rollin with that 4-5
Them hollow tips make sure that a nigga don't die
In AZ they say that nigga Juice is on fire
In Miami they say that nigga juice is loc'd out
So I peel it back and get so high oh my
Mary tellin' a nigga don't drive no lie
Every nigga I know be smokin' that weed
I'm high all the time and my favorite color is green
When you smoke I smoke, when you choke I choke
But don't hit it too fast motherfucker I'm broke
Just puff and pass when you smokin' on kush
And my weed got America fucked like George Bush

Man I get so high
Can you imagine how fast the weed go
Take two puffs then pass
Pull out another sack so we can roll that
Man I get so high

Take two puffs then pass

All he gon' do is hide behind M.O.P
And I can respect that, they just gettin' they cheese
They thugs, but what about M-A-dollar sign-E

This ain't Star Trak, this is the last call

Bottles on me, tell the waiter to order another round
And put that cheap-ass Hypnotiq down
Put your Cris' up if you feel the same way
Who got a mill switches? Everybody, let's ride
If I could fit the whole hood in the club
Hop in the lowrider, long as it got bitches in the back
I turn into a strip club
Call it a lap dance, when the 6 4 bounce that ass
If I could fit the whole world in the club
Tell the DJ to bang my shit, the West Coast in this bitch
Pop bottles and twist up
Roll up chronic and hash in a blunt, call it Aftermath
Somebody tell me where the drinks at, where the bitches at?
You fuckin' on the first night? Meet me in the back
I got a pound of chronic and a gang of freaks
Move bitch, who the fuck you think they came to see?
The protÃ©gÃ© of the D R E
Take a picture with him and you gotta fuck me
And you gotta fuck Busta, can't touch Eve
Got somethin' on my waist, say 'You can't touch Eve'
That's my gangsta bitch and like Crips and Bloods
I'm in the club on some gangsta shit
So nigga, twist up, light another dub
Bitches get scared when niggas start fightin' in the club
'Ain't Nuthin' But A G Thang', baby, it's a G thang
Bounce like you got hydraulics in your G-string
I fuck a different bitch seven days a week
Hit the switch, watch it bounce like a Scott Storch beat
If I could fit the whole hood in the club
Hop in the lowrider, long as it got bitches in the back
I turn into a strip club
Call it a lap dance, when the 6 4 bounce that ass
If I could fit the whole world in the club
Tell the DJ to bang my shit, the West Coast in this bitch
Pop bottles and twist up
Roll up chronic and hash in a blunt, call it Aftermath
Niggas thought I wasn't comin' back, look at me now
Hoppin' out the same cherry 6 4 with the motherfuckin' top down
I'm The Game, nigga, call your bitch
She ain't home, she with Game, nigga
Remember that, Dre? You passed me the torch
I lit the chronic with it, now the world is my ashtray
Ridin' three-wheel motion 'til the ass scrapes
Turn Sunset into a motherfuckin' drag race
Now watch it bounce, hit the switch
Let it bounce 'til the police shut the shit down
When you hit the club, tell 'em you came with me
We gon' twist up in the V.I.P
It's a new day and if you ever knew Dre
Motherfucker, you would say I was the new Dre
Same Impala, different spokes
Same chronic, just a different smoke
If I could fit the whole hood in the club
Hop in the lowrider, long as it got bitches in the back
I turn into a strip club
Call it a lap dance, when the 6 4 bounce that ass
If I could fit the whole world in the club
Tell the DJ to bang my shit, the West Coast in this bitch
Pop bottles and twist up
Roll up chronic and hash in a blunt, call it Aftermath",https://genius.com/The-game-lets-ride-explicit-lyrics
Jackin’ for Beats,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Straight outta Compton, Chuck Taylor in Brooklyn 8 deep
And the Desert Storm blew in Ghetto F-A-B
The only difference between us
Is the coast and the length of the ninas
And the rainbow paint on the beamers
Out here they call me ""All Star Game""
And every nigga with a gun is waiting on the '04 All Star Game
So while you in the Staples parking lot
I'm watchin the corners, with the safety on like Ronnie Lott

Straight outta Brooklyn it's the same youngan
Slangin that same onion
Smokin that Cali bud that my nigga Game brung in
I keep a dame tongue on my dick
The chain huggin my dick
The cane brung by the brick, it's ghetto!
The fiends sprung on me quick
But I still got 20s of dope that'll have yo brain strung on a fix
These haters can't stop the rock I pushes
Cause a nigga move around with more arms than them octipusses, nigga

I got a winchester that will turn your vest into confeddi
I'm Chuck Taylor, the same nigga that put the 6-4 in Chevy
It's the same nigga that keep the .44 in the Chevy
With no stash spot, when you in Compton ask coppers
If that Aston Martin's the same color as grass hoppers
I'm runnin the rock, not J, Dame Dash of Hoffa
So when you in Compton, you know who to ask for
That 21 year old young gun with bricks in the Jaguar, nigga

The kid push Bentley exaust thru
And if you see my guns you would think Bush sent me to war too
Even with chicks beggin me for dick regularly
A nigga known for gettin rid of weight like Dick Gregory
I'm New York City's fly guy, you bums don't impress me
I already got the lead waitin for someone to test me
You don't wanna be in the news
Cause when I'm lookin for you
Not even Bin Laden wanna be in your shoes, nigga

Every ghetto in America, I know that niggas lettin clips fly
So I keep that in mind when I'm out in the N-Y
Niggas see the Aftermath chain they like F 50
Cause we flyin; through Queens in that Ferarri F-50
Bitches see me in the video, wanna have sex with me
So keep a box of Magnums and a bag of X with me
Keep a .38 Magnum stashed in the vette with me
And it's 'fuck yo life' if you ain't signin check with me

Nigga I'm eatin, and you be snackin like you on a diet
That's why you window shoppin actin like you wanna buy it
Actin like you gonna roit, like you gonna shoot
When in fact you gone be quiet, like you on mute
That's proof, you a punk, and you lucky
There ain't enough room to fit a nigga in my roof or the trunk
I got a box to quickly hide the gun
You shouldn't move if you seen Boyz N The Hood
And when Ricky tried to run

Niggas know when them hollows airin'
I'll turn your Antoine Walker into a throwback Robert Parish
With 2 holes under the Celtic
And you will think your 'Boston Warm-Up' jacket hot
Till the desert eagle melt it
I'm a gangsta, and the birds, they love it
20 with a baby face, and sit on base like Kirby Puckett
If you can't afford the new Bentley, fuck it
Cop yay from Jay, the bricks come with Louis Vuitton luggage

In my hood the slower you move, the quicker they get you
Sometimes it's somebody in your click that be with you
That's why my vest is thicker to get thru
And I keep 2 nines on my shirt like Dickersons shit do
Why waste my breath when I'm bickering with you
I'd rather waste my techs till they flicker and hit you
You sick cause my shit blew
And you ain't goin' nowhere for a while
A commercial where Snickers will fit you, fucka!

Ain't nothin but a gangsta party when I'm spittin to Pac
The paint fall off your Miskeen when I'm spittin the Glock
Before I was 16, I was liftin the drop
Spittin on cops, pitchin the rock
Like Charlie Ward before the New York Knicks
Now you can catch me in Brooklyn with Fab
On a New York bench, while you old niggas in rehab
And if I can't be a hip-hop legend, I'll just die in a ski-mask

When a gangsta like me ride
It be suede in it, be shades in it
Tires that got the rims that Spree made in it
1 of the prettiest hoes be laid in it
Blowin the kid faster than pre-paid minutes
And I'm guessin these haters
Don't know I keep Wesson & 8ters
Fully loaded with the vest penetrators
But if they want it, ya'll can get it
Ya'll love the way the coast to coast G's did it, nigga!",https://genius.com/The-game-jackin-for-beats-lyrics

Heard you had trouble with them curve, I'll teach ya
Teach you how to ride it like the Raingler
Didn't your momma tell you not to fuck with strangers
The clit strangler, too late, you're in danger
The rain maker, you climax when I switch fingers
Ain't no body fuckin' wit' you, huh?
Wait 'til I slide in, put the whole nine in
Ain't no body fuckin' wit' you (ahh)

Jermaine Dupri-ass-niggas always rappin so-so
Always on my dick, jockin' my car, jockin' my bitch
Westside, I'm on that gangsta shit
After Snoop there will be no more, except for me
I snuck in Dr. Dre's kitchen and stole the recipe
Cook crack on these dope ass beats
I got heat like Pacino, lyrical assassin, there will be no
More beefin' with these corny ass rap niggas
Kill a nigga on your song never bust a gat, nigga
Yelling out CeeLo never shot a crack, nigga

Call Nas tell him hip hop is super dead
I had to fall back, try to desolve rap
Mix a classic with bakin' soda what you call that?
Niggas cut my legs off and watch me crawl back
Hip-hop king with a LA Dodgers ball cap
Who can fuck with me, go buck for buck with me?
Listenin' to my rhymes waitin on me to say fuck , haha
It ain't gon happen nigga, Hip hop done went soft
A million dollars every time I slap a nigga
You niggas know me, to take it from a OG
No more fuck you, back to sayin' fuck tha police
I stay on that motherfuckin' Straight Outta Compton
NWA shit, Hip-Hop need a facelift
Face it, take em' back to the basics

Car gettin' hyphy, stunner shades on the '64

Fluorescent lights, fluorescent ice
It's like Independence Day when I ride at night
It's like N.W.A when I ride in the day
My chest is cool and I'm cool as Dre
Nigga, I - make - hits
But we don't wear that Bape shit
My bandana red, it's Louis Vuitton
From out there, niggas can't tell it's Louis Vuitton
Come in here muhfucka where the weapons is drawn
The Cristal on ice and all the Henny is gone
And I still got five dimes on my arm
If that makes sense you gettin' warm, nigga you gettin' warned

Turn the lights off, turn the music up
I'll be there in the dark holdin' the speakers up
I will not stop, I can't be stopped
It ain't gon' stop till the music stops

Fifteen with a ounce, holdin' a deuce-deuce
Burnin' green on a suit, just fiendin' for new shoes
Leaning on grey juice, it's better than Grey Goose
Beverly came through, I got head in the grey coupe
Grey rims hit the corner, I'm burning the California
A young Suge Knight but I'm stranded down in Florida
House on the water, pool on the roof
Got work in the crib, worth a million a two
My cars on the grass, banks for the cash
Hit Chi-town, the wild honeys see the tags
I will not stop pullin' out knots
20's at the bottom, keep the 100's on the top
For, five, six hey Crack, let's get it
Forty-five bricks, beat the case, we did it

Turn the lights off, turn the music up
I'll be there in the dark holdin' the speakers up
I will not stop, I can't be stopped
It ain't gon' stop till the music stops

I'm in the 'hood with the speakers on blast like
When the Lambo pass
I came, I saw, I drove it away
Drove it through L.A. till niggas thought it was Dre
Bangin' Murcielago with the butterfly dohs
L.A. on my face like where the butterfly go
It disappeared cos I'm David Blaine
Niggas close they eyes and I change my chains
I walked into Jacob with a hundred thou
Next day, took the shit off and threw it in the crowd
So if you at a concert screamin' my name
Throw up a dub and you just might catch my chain

Turn the lights off, turn the music up

Compton Story,UnKnown,UnKnown,"""Uncle Chucky would you read us a bedtime story please, huh please?""
""Alright you kids get to bed, I'll get the story book
Y'all tucked in?""
""Yes""
""Heeeere we go...""
Slammed the Impala door hopped out ""What do you see?""
Some niggas hanging on the fence looking at me
I had fat red laces in my Adidas
Big chain around my neck like mardi gras
So I stepped up to 'em, ""Is there a problem here?""
One nigga lifts his shirt then he yells out ""Yeah""
So I turned around quickly and I jumped in my car
I was about to hit the switch then I thought like, ""nah""
So I reached under my seat and I grabbed my shit
It was the chrome .45 with the kung-fu grip
Stuffed it inside my dickies as I jumped out the car
Kept my hand on the trigger as I walked in the store
One nigga walks in then here comes two
""What did you do?"", I shot, ""Are you crazy fool?""
One nigga hit the ground and the other two scrammed
Now the cops are outside, well I'll be damned
It was 7:15, on my Rolex watch
And i can't do the time that my Rolex got
And like the hands on the clock, I went this way that a-way
Ran around the corner and that's when I threw my gat away
An Impala passed, its my home boy Clyde
He gave me the hand signal so I jumped in his ride
It was a clean '64 original inside
With no key in the ignition, ""Where'd you get this Clyde?""
Nevermind I'm out, its a stolen whip
And I'm already runnin' from the cops and shit
So I hopped out the car like the dukes of hazard
Then Clyde yells out, ""You stupid bastard!""
Start runnin' through traffic and I almost got hit
I lost one of my shoes, its my air force shit!
I'm hobblin' down the street with one shoe on
Walked straight into some niggas with all blue on
I only ran 30 blocks, how I end up in Long Beach?
Cause in California, the gangs in arm reach
He saw my red strings so he punched and caught me
Then I knocked his ass out and took his boy out his Barkley's
I ain't seen these since 92
I'm feelin' like a bad boy without the shiny suit
Here the cops come, shit! So I dashed behind the Honda
And look who's here, my baby momma's friend Rhonda
In the car kissin' on this dope dealer Chris, but
Little did he know he was suckin' my dick
I start bangin' on the window ""I don't mean to disturb""
""But Chris can you drop me off downtown on 3rd?""
He said ""why sure, what up, Game, hope in""
He was bangin Slick Rick then I got an idea
Before we get to 3rd drop me off right here
So I can walk inside the mall and cop some new gear
As I walked in the store they could see I was in a rush
So they bout me some jeans, a t-shirt and some fresh chucks
Walked out the store looked left, ""oh no!""
Ran back in the store, here comes the 5-0
So I ran real quick, made a move to the back
Cold knocked this cute bitch into a polo rack
""Sorry"", jumped over her and fled to the back door
Then I kicked the shit open, you won't believe who I saw
Its the nigga Chris in hand cuffs pointin' at me
And the cops made chase before they let Chris free
One cop tried to grab me and the other one missed
I got away one more time and they both got pissed
Full speed out the mall, spotted this blue coupe
Dogg Pound on the plates, that gotta be Snoop
So I ran up to the car and I said, ""Yo Snoop
The cops got me on the run"" ""Need a ride nephew?""
""Hell yeah big Snoop"" ""Lil homie hop in""
""Drop me off in Compton"" and that's where my story ends
Now this ain't funny so don't ya dare laugh
Just another story about the wrong path
Had a long day so I reclined my seat
It was a 20 min ride to the CPT
Walked straight into the house, pulled out my key
Opened up the door, it's my girl playing Biz Markie
Oh you, you got what I neeeeeeeeeed",https://genius.com/The-game-compton-story-lyrics

I’m tryna go hard in the phantom
Hit Sunset Boulevard in the phantom

I got a bottle of Cristal in the phantom
Im waving my black card in the phantom

Plus im 6’5 sittin tall in the phantom
Dre lookin for me tell him call in the phantom
Im a boss in the phantom

You would think my nigga just blaze in the phantom
So I blaze in the phantom

You should’ve seen my nigga Dr Dre in the phantom (chop chop)
Nigga had his chef and maid in the phantom
He lemme spent a couple days in the phantom
Me and the chaffeur got laid in the phantom
Now paid in the phantom
Close shades in the phantom
Only thing a nigga can't do is bath in a phantom
And he tryna D Wade in the phantom
Bulletproof doors, can't get sprayed in the phantom

Short skirts in the phantom
Rosé in the phantom
Girl you out the front door and chanelle in the phantom
Six inch red button louis vitton in the phantom
Drop you out first class g5 in the phantom
Pick you up, take you home, my mansion in the phantom
Cars so fly take off from Atlanta
Brought Game in the phantom
Brought weight in the phantom
My sex and the cities, mr Bigg in the phantom
You can spend cake and eat it too in the phantom

You Are The Blood,Brake Lights,2010.0,"You are the blood flowing through my fingers
All through the soil and up in those trees

One-nine seven-nine, that was the year California would go blind
My momma had a son, a fully automatic gun
Eleven pounds, seven ounces, Compton, here we come
My first night in my crib, I hear somebody screaming
A couple gunshots, then some tires screeching
My father reaching, what is he grabbing
He rolled me over in my crib just to get his Magnum
Is he a policeman, that's what I'm thinking
He can't be that because he do heroin and he be drinking
Chopping baby powder up on my momma's mirror
Mexican chicks in my kitchen cooking, looking just like Shakira
I'm in my high chair, they naked, this is rated R
Think I ain't paying attention cause you slide me a Gerber jar
Then my momma walked in with an orange box
I couldn't read what it said cause she leaned over and said

You are the blood flowing through my fingers
And I can feel it in my heart
My mom said it from the start
That I would always be the reason blood's flowing
All through the soil and up in those trees

(This is a DJ Skee exclusive)

First day of kindergarten, shoestrings for a belt
Mom's worked the graveyard, too tired so I dress myself
Who go to school in a Freddy Krueger flannel
Black Chuck Taylors and I never liked sandals
A lot of birthdays but we ain't never light candles
Gang of Christmas gifts but I ain't never seen Santa
So I waited up one year, guess who came to my garage
My daddy with a Toys 'R' Us bag, hit the lights, aha!
Uh-uh, I ain't going for that
I've got presents, I can see 'em 'cause they ain't wrapped
From a race track to a Dre track
Don't wear overalls no more, but a nigga stay strapped
The rumor round my middle school was that I can't rack
It wasn't a locker in that motherfucker that I ain't paint black
And now I'm doing donuts in this Maybach
Reminiscing 'bout detention, teachers used to say that

You are the blood flowing through my fingers
And I can feel it in my heart
My mom said it from the start
That I would always be the reason blood's flowing
All through the soil and up in those trees",https://genius.com/The-game-you-are-the-blood-lyrics
Truth Rap,Untold Story: Volume II,2005.0,"Yeah, big spit, it's that Bay Area game, Sean T beats
We feedin the underground with this Yay Area tycoon shit
For my nigga JT Fig', y'all know where it come from
Never forget it, that Bay Area shit mayne
Y'knahmtalkinbout? Yeah!
Game, spit that shit

Hey yo the kid still at it, woke up from that coma
Seen hell came back and here comes my first classic
Still chop it up at the table, still put dope in the bag
And still got dope, under the mattress
It was hustle before rappin, nuttin before that and
12 years old, a lost soul, bumpin ""Illmatic""
Gunshots tried and almost took the young kid's live
Can't do it I been through it the young kid survived
Got the ghetto on my shoulder homie, it's gon' be a long ride
Bear with me, I'mma take you there with me
Show you how the sun shine in one rhyme, no more stormy weather
Streets is mine, we gon' live forever
Get it together 'Pac is watchin, Big is listenin
Eazy is talkin to us, Big Pun is witnessin
While they souls still glistenin in ghettos from Compton to Brooklyn
The shells cry, every hood's anthem
Where everybody goes to church and prayers are never answered
And they throwin' us curveballs but we Hank Aarons
A picture with no canvas, streets are so skanless
Young'uns jump rope, play ball with fiends and dope handlers
Teenage mothers, deadbeat fathers, no families
Lost and often runaway or live with grandparents
Life stories with no authors, see it through, {?} Robinson's cubicles
When time life is so beautiful
Walk with me we can make it if we try, lost soldiers sometimes
We gotta die but it's okay to cry
Mothers strugglin tryin to survive, reach out grab my hand
I got'cha, won't let you go for nuttin, I promise
Praises due to Elijah Muhammad, peace be unto Farad Muhammad
Words of Minister Farrakhan
Been true, be loyal, know your roots, water your soil
Stop fightin amongst ourself from birth we royal
Who's king we fightin over a crown, while lifeguards
Watch the hopes and dreams of kids and young teens drown
More infants bein born with AIDS, more parents mournin graves
The plot thickens, somebody show us the way
Tears crackin the pavement, streets breakin up
The thrill is gone and it's a long walk home
So we might as well start runnin, if it's there gotta take it
'Member Jada said ""We Gon' Make It""
And it shouldn't take 9/11 to bring our minds together
Shit rough we'll grind together
Light a candle we can shine forever or I can pass
So I won't miss Aaliyah's concert in heaven
Live life while we listen to my old heads
So I glow like the memory of Lisa 'Left Eye' Lopez
Through a six-seven Brougham, ride with me through the hood mayne
Where street lights flicker and Chuck Taylors hang
And nobody know they neighbor's name 'less they sell weed or cocaine
A lot of black clouds on a block but no rain
And Game got a lot to say, so they wanna take me down
In my own front yard like Marvin Gaye
Can't do it by myself, people need help
Keep on tryin to live healthy 'til the end of my days
And when I die won't lead my daughter astray, lookin from heaven
Watch my people drive my coffin through the Compton parade

I'm in the city where it's strange where killers follow direction
And trail witness protection to get a shot at they brain
Where the babies carry semis and swallow pills for power
Count paper for polly'n, penny-pinch for hours
Take sacks from cowards when the streets is watchin
Tuck guns in trunks cause real G's is boxin
Ain't no other options if you stand on your own two
And if you came to battle you can stand in the phone booth
Cause we don't wear capes in this part of the land
Cause every youngster from my block has been a part of the plan
I've been trainin since eighty-seven and famous since eighty-nine
Teaching came from the Nation, my spirit is from divine
When I, pass the word through these raps on beats
It's fo'sho' that the Lord gon' make the whole track speak
To the streets, when I pass these beats
It's fo'sho' that the Lord gon' make the whole track speak
To the streets, y'knahmtalkinbout people?
Make the track speak, ""Truth Rap,"" get it right
""Truth Rap"" mayne, for the people, get it right, ""Truth Rap""",https://genius.com/The-game-truth-rap-lyrics

Exterminate your rap for ya
Send a bitch to bust a gat for ya

Yeah, do for Shyne what he did for Puff
Sit in jail for ten years, who fuckin' with us?

We are hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop
Tell my mother that I can't stop makin' it
Tell her that my rags still hangin'
Tell her that my names still ringin'

Back 4 to 4 times, nigga here we go

If it's Lakers vs. Celtics, I'm the departed

Gave Jim Jones my rag, let him rock it
Gave Young Money my flag, right pocket

And make sure you wipe it off it you gon' shoot it

And now I'm poppin' Chris, cause I know Luda

Get a vest, and start workin'n on your motherfuckin' (?) game
Fuck money nigga, I got enough fame
And you could trust Game

Sittin' on the top of the world with his hands up
If you into gettin' money, this the anthem
Somebody tell my grandmama that her grandson
Got the hood on his shoulders and he can't run
He got to stay and fight

For my soldiers, the goons and the goblins
These rap niggas characters, Batman and Robin
Me? I had the Louie ville bad, and I was robbin'
Red shit on my head, I was Rodman
And I rebounded after G-Unit
I sell records, Jimmy ain't gotta sneak units
Used to walk to the door, my spotted peak through it
Sit, stare at my 'Pac poster and speak to it
Crack hip-hop, and let The Chronic seek through it
Niggas feedin' off me, cause I eat music

Cats tellin jokes at them car games

Any nigga with a chip on his shoulder, whattup nigga?
You want beef with me?  Now I let the heat speak for me
No more talkin, just outline chalkin
Nigga Witta Attitude from birth, ""100 Miles and Running""
Gunnin bustin shots like fuck the cops
Notorious for burnin blocks, weavin in and out of traffic and chop

Steal from the rich, give to the poor, coward niggas rock
Second comin of this black Alfred Hitchcock
Kick in the door, wavin the four-four
Ten shots to your spleen, let them violins sing

Yo, I'm just a ghetto nigga stuck in this game, young'uns runnin with 'caine
Rain hits so we floodin the game
When you come to Compton respect the grounds, leave you shook man

Hey yo I don't give a fuck who you are, fuck ya ice
Fuck the block that you claim, fuck your Bentley Azure

Fast cars, money and muscle, the hustle I was brought up in the 80's

Them hustlin guns like Knicks players, we got mouths to feed
'Til they put flowers on me, moms kiss my cold cheek
In that pine box, I'm buyin rocks, eyein cops
Fuck a cell block, the young kid makin it happen
Who you think got them fiends runnin back like Bo Jackson?
I'm a gangsta, what else could I say?
I'm ahead of myself like it's Y4K
2Pac, Scarface, N.W.A
Taught me how to dodge them bullets, keep my wig in play
Keep fo' snug in the waist or pay a thousand to have 'em
Niggas in the street move faster than, Michael Jackson's album
But the shit don't really matter to me, we get better G
Bet the four slow 'em down like PCP


Real gangsters never talk shit, handle they business
Fuck the dry snitchin and bitchin, niggas die when them bullets fly
Who fuckin with him, ha?  Not a nigga alive
End up dead in that 5
He got no sympathy for them dead guys, friend or foe
Watch that chest cave in, what that vest savin?
Make it sloppy for the autopsy, leave my enemies in a frenzy
On the frontlines holdin a 9
Everyday a new chapter, my own niggas plottin on me
Tryin to hit me but they won't get me, feel the semi first
Fuckin with my dough, is the worst way to go
Y'all know, niggas cry when them bullets burn slow dummy
In and out of spots watchin my money
If one dollar come up missin bodies start to come up missin
No one too heavy for the Expedition, piss on your corpse
Watch your soul shiver, throw him in the river, bitch nigga",https://genius.com/The-game-im-looking-lyrics
Don’t Kill My Vibe,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Bitch, don’t kill my vibe – nigga, don’t blow my high

I’m king of the motherfuckin’ Westside
Two dubs up when the teks fly
“Bla! Bla! Bla! Bla! Bla! Bla! Bla! Bla!”
Turn a 600 to an S5
Compton made me direct this ending
Like my little nigga Kendrick, props to Jay-Z
Got a Rocky pendant and a drop Mercedes
I’ll been gone ’til November but I’m not from Haiti
I’m a C-O-M-P-T-O-N, N-I
Double G A like a young D-Wade
Brought my city a championship by myself
And niggas think I’m doin’ this shit for my health
I am, don’t make me go ham, 4-5
Go blam, I was just protecting my wealth
Matte black Bentley, all-black pennies
Black Tom Ford shades, I’m ’bout to go stealth
All black everything…
Trap Wesley Snipes inside Tiffany’s wedding ring
Nigga, never get out…
I’m constipated, just tryna get my shit out
False alarm, I can’t do #2
Pee on you peons for eons and eons
Used to intercept niggas, rock like Deion
Sellin’ white packs out my grandmama’s Neon
Ask my nigga Breon…
I played ‘Pac’s brother in this classic movie
No relationship to Leon…
When I spit for Dre I had a nigga forehead like a nigga was a klingon
No album out, I’m on 106 like a nigga put Free on
Any beat that I breathe on or be on, I be gone
I brawl like I’m out in Maryland, Georgetown, Michigan
Florida, watch a nigga get his unc on
Baby Jordans for my baby daughter
No Harold Miner, can I get my usc on?
Eight cars in my driveway, sideways
Horsepower make the Lamborghini fly away
I am the shit when I step out the Six
And I step at your bitch in my brand new kicks
…you bitch… don’t act brand new
‘Cause you suck on my dick when you walk in my crib
Airplane mode, won’t be no duck lips next to Van Gogh
Dance with the devil, I learned to tango
“S” on the metal, I wrapped the Range Rove
Ride to my limits inside the Infinite
God is my witness, I’ve got the roof in it
Designed to go win it
Mismatched rims on the motherfuckin’ Phantom
Nigga, nigga on God, I’mma spend it
Compton… Westside, and I’m riding with Kendrick

I am a sinner who’s probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me
Things I don’t understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don’t kill my vibe, bitch don’t kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it but today I’m yelling
Bitch don’t kill my vibe, bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe, bitch don’t kill my vibe

All the money in the world couldn't change me
No diamond rings or them fancy cars
'Cause my niggas in the hood woulda let me
Holler this because
(I'm from the ghetto)
I'm from the ghetto
(I'm from the projects)
I'm from the projects
All over the world and every hood they know
I'm from the ghetto and that's fo sho'

All over the world and every hood they know

Aha, yeah, ugh, they know
Yeah, ugh, ain't no help there just food stamps
Weight checks and welfare
Every man gone for self there
Still might need to borrow your medicade card for health care
Yeah, if you never got knocked then you made it
Everybody know each other if not they related
You can get shot or get bladed
There's dudes that got jobs now that had blocks in the eighties
Six months five years for you just to cop out
Ninth or tenth grade is usually when niggas drop out
Fights break out when you wired and start joking
A lot of OG's retired and started smokin'
House party games of spade sweet kool aid
Loud music all night till the boys in blue raid
So therefore I could never be too paid
I know where I'm going and where I'm from will get you laid
All the money in the world couldn't change me
No diamond rings or them fancy cars

I'm from the ghetto and that's fo sho'
Ha, ha, tell me this how come
Black folks get a little doe
And forget where they come from
Man we used to have good times
But since you moved on up you ain't cool with us
We still support you tho we don't see you much
You ain't the first fool its cool with us
But why you living out your idols dreams
Remember how for you came and help you keep those thangs
Now its cool that your address changed
But I'm tryna holla at my dog and the number ain't the same
I guess new homies came with his fame
But see true homies will stay the same
Through all the up's and down's in your career
A couple wives few kids scattered here
And when you dead or broke without a deal
All the groupies cleared, the ghetto will still be here
All the money in the world couldn't change me
No diamond rings or them fancy cars
'Cause my niggas in the hood woulda let me

Gangstas Ride,UnKnown,UnKnown,"The motherfucking Originator (haha)
Gangstas ride on
Gangstas ride on

Worldwide Originator and I'm packin' a 4
Motherfucker going home no more
Not a thug but I put you in the rug with a couple of slugs
Try the canvas, hoes blow where the white chalk closed door
Friends turn enemies stolen identity, can't get rid of me
I watched the cocaine bubble up and kilo price double up
You got a problem with a Marcy nigga like I would'a knuckle her up
But you know about 1976 a young nigga gettin' money
Playin' tripple up I'm the prototype, first one, king of the tricklet
When I first did it Twista wasn't even in the business
Knew B.I.G. when he wasn't even in the business
Put the lil' nigga Jay-Z in the business
Got a motherfucker three-way 'till he shitless
My style's hostile, Jay's not the style

Now when the niggas gone tough slick when the guns come out
Niggas see me in OG rollin' on goldies
Runnin' the house Paul Wall did ya grill open up let me see catch wildin 'em out
Niggas snitch
Six in ya fit it forget it talk shit you better live on my nigga
I'm on the block 'till I get here, ball like the business
I'm raining dollar swap pop big shit
10 months while platinum black subtract, take half of that
Bring it back now, like an ounce of crack
Then put it in a plastic back and call it Aftermath
I walk like a gangsta, talk like a gangsta
Impala with the Cherry-red paint

And them gangstas ride on
(East side, west side c'mon)
And them gangstas ride on
(North side, south side c'mon)

Like tellin' nigga couldn't spill half a gallon
Who the fuck said a man couldn't be anillin'
Back pockets to the concrete for the wrong heat
Three bodies at, where the body bags that's a wrap don't want them Aftermath don't wanna make'em mawee
'Cause I'm so street
Been a mack since Hawaiian Sophie
Got ya ice grills with 40 fills, still
Act like you know me homie
God will make your... holy
Watch me closely
Triple 
That's level baby I'm a  weather baby

And them gangstas ride on
(East side, west side c'mon)
And them gangstas ride on
(North side, south side c'mon)

Niggas don't want it with the bee gees
Niggas don't wanna see me 'cause I'm an a-hole
Especially when I ride with Jaz-O in a continental T with the ass low
What you got your foot on the gas for
We get dat doe
Climb through the window
And run through the back door
Black out with the mack out
Blast four blast four more
Originator give em what they ask for

Enemies I murder 'em
I hurry like I bury 'em
Walk through your hood with my two blocks on
I'm in my new shoes with my new socks on
Shine like a diamond get your blue blocks on
Jaz-O, stupid motherfucker, not Shawn
Never been blast on a 2Pac song
The originator, double time creator
Too fast

And them gangstas ride on

Had them hoes bouncin' on my dick like a Chevrolet
Put on for my city, nigga city on my face
And I'm 'bout to throw a party, tell Diddy send a case
Fuck a square nigga, I'll say it to his face
Rap niggas quick to tell like it's a snitch nigga race
My nigga Frank told me, ""take your time bakin' cakes""
Gotta get to the money at a Indiana pace

Stay strapped up like I'm 5150
Mo' K's than the mothafuckin' pitcher
Get your ass smoked like a Swisher

Fuck the paper, nigga shoot the whole fuckin' gun range
Yellin' at the cop car ""soo-woo"", here I come Wayne
Bail only a hundred thousand, nigga that's chump change
Back on deuces, front's on dubs
Bet a Bentley and a Phantom that this bitch don't run
When you worth twenty mill, you can shine when it's sunny
Just turned thirty, so I can't be from Young Money

Niggas from the crew then there's nigga with young money
Hatin' on a real nigga cause he on and you not
Cut your head, got some tats, now he think he 2Pac

Boy done grew a beard now he think he Rick Ross
Say he sellin' birds can't tell you what it costs
How the fuck you gon' get a chicken off

Coconut Ciroc by the case, give me groupie love
Grammy nominated, ain't forgot about the stove
Paint the Phantom all red, call that bitch Derrick Rose
In and out of lanes, 24's insane
To think I got this far from sellin' cocaine

Take your ass to Staples, get your rubber bands up nigga
Made all this fuckin' money what the fuck I'm gon' cop now

Fuckin' the finest divas, if I have it  I'd like to meet 'cha
Show you how I light the streets up, kill niggas that never speak up
You my fans, sit in the stands and watch me rip these beats up
Like a legend, feel my presence like the dead ones
If I die, my only wish is my face on some Air-1s (Okay, okay, okay)
My soul's curled, my baby mommas they drive 6s
As for my bitches there's other rappers out there that's trickin'
My only mission was to sell a couple records
Buy a Bentley and drive reckless, a big medallion on my necklace
I 'seen Kane and Rakim do it, so much respect here
Hip Hop is dead because you new niggas dont get the message
I used to call names out, you niggas dont deserve it
So lame out, die from these bullets 'outta Game's mouth (ooh)

Yeah I've been here flexin' my shit nigga I told you
Yeah I see your shit's on fire, nigga I know you got some more shit I can listen to
Shit, hell yeah check it

My flow polished, I studied the legends
Hip-Hop scholar kick knowledge get dollaz'
You got some work then holla
I'm on the block pitchin', most of us got riches
Not trippin' work hydraulics and fuck the hot bitches
Youngins dont stop wishin', if you got a block then flip it
Just because I'm a blood don't mean my niggas should stop crippin'
We from the ghetto, we came up without a pot to piss in
We gettin' money stayin' blunted cause' the clock is tickin'
You got a rock then pitch it, you got a Glock then lift it
Them G-Unot t-shirts make them niggas stop snitchin'
Forever ballin' I'm Jim Jones with rims
On that blue Aston Martin interior like my skin tone
Most of these rappers want me dead, shit I been gone
Too classic, move rapid, my jewels the blackest
The first 8 letters and everything that I stand for
Colder than a New York block, shut the damn door
[Interlude: Game & 
Young Rob

Changed up your style up this shit, ooh-ee
Had to give the East coast niggas somethin' man
You know I be on my motherfuckin' gangsta shit
Sometimes I just gotta' spaz out
Man, damn I can't wait 'till you're home, boy
You know man, it's like, it's just another year and half
I'll be good man. Need some pussy though, that's the main shit

Where gangbangers throw hot rocks the boys coming So what

And say we got rocks High-school drop outs
They're there to air the block out, stack paper like the OGs told us

See, she was eighteen, wanted to fuck with that nigga
Pops sold heroin so he was that nigga
Carried a .45 and he bust that trigger
Ain't nobody in Compton touch that nigga
But that was back then, so fuck that nigga
My childhood wasn't shit, so fuck that nigga
I been shot, been to jail, rode around Compton on Spreewells
Moved to the hills still poke your ass out like Sprewell
Still crack distribute, what you want nigga? Post sale retail

Yeah nigga she fine, but not like she was in Boomerang
Now she okay like OJ and Gucci Mane
Like them I was rappin' and trappin'
Kept half a brick in the back of my momma's Acura
Give me a test
Hit the question, how many O's in a brick, I'll ace that shit
Brick come through the door, taste that shit
Chop it, bag it, let 'em freebase that shit
She ain't tryna fuck I'll mace that bitch
Take her Cosmo and lace that shit
Get pussy for free, I ain't take that shit, I don't know if I raked that bitch

I sat on and took the plastic off of ""Life After Death""
Bangin', bonin' Biggie-Biggie I did a 360
The Aftermath for that is the nigga 50 ain’t wit me
No hard feelings, we both made millions
You can hate me or love me but nigga I spit real shit
Like I'm comatose, tell the Doc I'm sick
Before Detox, let me take my last Chronic hit
Now I am gangsta rap
Inhale the weed smoke and coughed up five platinum plaques
So I’m a let the nigga Dr. Dre hit

I don't make love, I make hits

Leave all semi I tote, clips empty
Foes tempt me, I'm seein no penitentiary
Crime scene clean, shells, no prints
Flee the shootout, X-5, no {?}

Meant for you not to be livin, food for the pigeons
It's rules I'm givin, new lessons for the street

(Rippin up tracks and, doin the thang)

I'm off the rack like slabs of ribs, I want it big
I ain't fuckin with kids, I'm after six digit things
Fuck the rings and the tribulations, constant playa hatin
This crimin-al lifestyle, keeps me animatin
Let's turf talk before you niggas thuggin it up
It don't matter if you Crip'n, or Blood'n it up
Dallas Squad blooded it up, smashin on sight
But he hoppin on haters like BMX bikes
Fuck around with the Squad see unbearable sights
We takin gangster shit to the maximum height
But I'm mainly into bubblin, fat grip doublin
Big heads I'm lovin 'em, you feelin me y'all
Leavin the envious in awe cause I tremendously ball
I'm supported by the Game so you know I won't fall
I'ma execute my options, keep wettin my paws
And come out unscathed with no scratches or flaws

Introduce the new fiends to smack

So I don't listen to pops nigga I listen to Kool G. Rap
Went from hustlin sacks to heavy weight, shufflin crack
Kids and preachers know me, young Game the O.G
Ask the reverand kept the church from fallin, young'uns from starvin
I'm the project like Marcy or the Nickerson Gardens
Comfortable dawg, Compton to Harlem, any city ghetto or hood
Kick back, blowin, listen to Marvin

AK in the sofa, I'm the illest, who come closer
To the late ones or great ones fightin over a crown
Get shot off that throne, who the illest now, huh?


Some say the gangster mentality is dead, imagine that
When fools pullin straps out with infrared
We're livin in a time of plagues and corrupt life
When homies in the circle end up all trife
Tryin to shine bright, but lookin all dim
Meanwhile I stay sharp like a ballpoint pen
I see the smirks and grins but I just laugh
Cause I'm gettin lucrative loot, endless math
If you only knew the half of it, you wouldn't hate
But niggas just pig and talk shit behind Jake
Man you cain't knock the hustle, I ain't fin' to be greedy
I want an exit out the game kinda like Paul Vitti

Dirty white T cause I just came from the block
Dirt under my nails and I think he could tell

I was somethin' that he never seen, saggin' in some Polo jeans

He was makin' beats so I did my little head thing

Or you can ask Dre, he put me (in the hall of fame)
So if Busta Rhymes is Magic I'm (Big Game James)


Ever since I was a just a little youngin
I was always gratefull that you gave me somethin'
I don't think you realize how it was so major
For me to receive your blessing, let me return the favor
I know that we been through a couple of things
To me it don't really matter I wanna see you win
That's why I always rep for you, trust me it's a honor
Cause you're the male figure that birthed as my father

What happened to E-V-E, what happened to Rakim
I'm still here, cause I'm not them
They went back to the East like 2Pac Tims
And if you can't understand that you a stocked rim
And I'm a 28, you can't stop them
There ain't a pothole in Brooklyn that can stop him
You feel you Dwight Howard, nigga take your shots then
Bring that shit to the home of tumble gon' block them

I would take the cake but I've been paid
I'm a real nigga, you's arcade
Had a switch blade in the 5th grade
Smoked plenty weed on my mama's couch
Now I'm going big, I can buy the house
You sell water down, I sell low for ounce
See this for adults who say where you from
If those hoes who gonna make me cum
With them fuck niggas we don't fuck around
And fuck niggas gonna lose a lot
Knock knock nigga, come feel the drama
If the bed low I'mma stack the crown
Up the contraband in-between my gun
Before smoking dope I was selling coke
Well rocked up to a 8 year old
When it popped up, call it pot luck
500 G's, nigga pretty please
Condos, where it's sun and trees
10 keys with my 8 G's
Hoover hats like the star of David
Pull on shots unless kidney faded
Rent a pony, might go with Emmett
Move out the set but the set I'm banging
(Chorus)
Too high, can't come down
Losing my head, spinning round and round
Too high, can't come down
Losing my head, spinning round and round

Look, a young nigga really tryna stunt, fuck it
West side neighbors and I ain't budging
Independent niggas with no budget
If it ain't about a dollar gotta change subjects
Rap ass niggas ain't seen nothing
This flow here, niggas can't touch it
Motherfuck friends, tinted windows on the Benz
Doing doughnuts in the bitch got me trippin like a bucket
Shots going off in the streets
10 hut, big squads are with me
See niggas 12 ballin like they been in the gym
But you lookin like a novice to me, now quit talkin to me
Can I vet? All you niggas sound retarded to me
Killin these niggas, I'm a general nigga
Turn yo head to target for free
Now I'm on, look at me
Started, started with them pesos and palm trees
Now when niggas come through the wood niggas gotta know that that's all me
See the set catch rap
When I slide through throwin up a bill
And niggas wanna act like they thuggin like, we said boy please
This S to the K to the E to the E nigga
New Rolls go vroom nigga
Got a 5 cocked back like boom nigga
Got enough room to fill up a room nigga
And I'm all in these, had 100 a go
Gave her that dick now she beggin for more
Pay me a millie, yo bitch load is illie
But I ain't got, still got 100 to go
And I do it, I does it
I swear that you love it
I just left from Newark, got bands in my luggage
Play with you rappers, my nigga
This black mack
Take out my dick, take a piss on the public like fuck it
(Chorus)
Too high, can't come down
Losing my head, spinning round and round
Too high, can't come down
Losing my head, spinning round and round
Round and round
Round and round
Too high, can't come down
Too high, can't come down
Too high, can't come down

Nigga done run everywhere
Left trails in my city everywhere
But nowhere like home
See I won't killed when on
Bitch come and dust my throne
Stand from grandmother's porch to my executive Porsche
Now I'm driving through London alone
With a Parisian bitch
Rockin corn rolls, backseat of my Panamera watchin pornos
Where we goin?
What we doin?
Fly to Johannesburg
Nigga city in ruins then fly to Dubai
On my poolside, coolin my Audemar
You waterproof fuckin gone, let em know that I admit
Everywhere around the world and that's cool
But can a hotel fuckin reserve us parked through
My hood gorillas move whenever sharks move
Move to back to Compton shit, we are too
Condos and wheels to shit, I bought two
Livin down the street where BIG got shot, I hunt you
And the very next day where Pac met his fate
It's how we live our life, surrounded by Che, pause
(Verse)
Where the angels fly, city of angels, I will never let you down
Kill anything approaching my crown
Still undefeated
That's why I got my kids building sand castles on the beaches
But don't get it confused, said he still got moves
Where the wrong colors niggas end up on the news like Sal
Like Durant in a dream then I'm right back down Compton avenue in a Buick
If you had the hot niggas put a bullet through it
And it took a coma for you to be king would you do it?
Would you do it?
If I dropped you off at Watts would you walk through it?
Would you be from great street or would you Piru it?
Here's my red raggers that's ain't nothing to it
There go the 60's, motherfucker good luck
(Welcome to California bitch)
They were the 60's, motherfucker good luck
(Verse)
From the corner where that ho said that hit kat
Short dress, head and that bizac
You know me with my thumb in my index
Nah, I ain't bloodin nigga
Pass blunts to my cousins nigga
Turn hale into gold, I can pon the river
High power, you a amish liver
Cali dro in my lungs and such
Twisted blunts from dawn to dusk
My shoe box should've been a armored truck
Everything good, feeling marvelous
Came to the city, that you honored us
You don't talk me a game, no game homie
Get greedy with the clip, no aim on it
Uh, Mr. 3rd degree
Burn like the bridge and yo business uh
Started at the floor, at the beginning uh
Now I rep the floor until the ending uh
Smoking on ills cuz I'm winnin
Wax getting blowed, just the pin lit
Uh, yea now back to the booth, back to the hoes
Ra ta ta in the lap with the 2
No Cali J, I still ran all blow
All in the trim, straight lookin like you
Free tattoo
(Verse)
I'm in the gangsta shit, gangsta clothes and gangsta crib
Need a gangsta bitch to take the dope and hop the fence
Might die on the freeway
Hey, much love to the he way, aye
Watch you know about LA?

Stay low from the comas
Make a right fore they dome us

Stay low from the comas

Got a bitch, say she wanna fuck in Beverly Hills
And I swear I'mma bring her to the set if she will
And if I do the pussy better killin
Just the way I make her feel, no step in they mills
These niggas hella be trip, these niggas never be real
I came up in a world where it's kill or be killed
I swear that every bitch I used to fuck fuck me still
Just give a dick, never covered a bill
This shit is real, this west side INGFCF
Bands on them bitches, getting M's on them bitches
Going for the Cartier, hands on the bitches
Last long like I'm using extends on them bitches
I'm a native, I got real niggas with me
Gold state, gold grills, I put on for the Betty White
Middle fingers for the peace
Tell them bitch niggas suck a dick
Man come and get me out

Promised Land,West Coast Resurrection,2005.0,"Sometimes I wonder
Man, how long is it gon' be for my people to come out?
Man we strugglin, it's hard sometimes, but
Tomorrow's better than yesterday, uhh

I was born in the slums, struggled from day one
Ray Charles vision, blinded by the light from the sun
No navigation, no sense of direction, darker complexion
Made it hard to live; dad, how you fathered your kids?
Stranded on the highway of life, left us out to die, left us out to dry
Shhhh, I'm still hearin' my mother's cries nigga
No father figures make harder niggas
Through the years I went to war with niggas from what I saw in the pictures
Now your son is bigger, thirteen, but just like you
Moms said I would grow up and be just like you
From what you did to my sister she disliked you
Sixteen, eleventh grade, look at me just like you
Gunnin' for riches, runnin' hoppin' project fences
Street corners to Arizona, how I earn my digits
And I'm far from finished, gamin' 'til my coffin diminish
Why pray for the afterlife when mine's just beginnin', huh

...Promised Land...
...Promised Land...

Only son by a mother, no brothers, only sisters by this one
Every time I kiss one I miss one, let me explain
Eight years before The Game, everything came with pain
Watch the fate of my family slain, would never see good times a-gayn
Cursed with pain by a nigga with no shame
My father bear the same name as his father, my grandfather
Wouldn't believe, he pulled up our family tree
I can see him rolling over in his coffin
I'm left with often, thoughts of how could you molest your daughter?
They say that's ten times worse than manslaughter
Man you oughta, be dead in a grave
But it wasn't my call, so instead you sat in a cage
High-powered, two-hundred and fifty pound, six-five coward
Woulda been dead in an hour
Heard you was scared to take a shower, scared of the yard
Your end is near, you shoulda been scared of God, motherfucker


(All my niggas listen, huh)
I stay a step ahead of the rest of y'all
Why I gotta keep a vest for y'all
Though I made it dog, I still stress for y'all
Funny how my folks think rap money stretch so far
Pray to God my niggas see through all the checks and the cars
I'm tryin to invest in what's ours, gimme a couple of years dog
I'll turn your tears, stress, and your scars
Into lawn chairs and green grass in your yard
I'm tryin' to watch my kids wrestlin' y'alls
Not have to get 'em ready for school and strap a vest on 'em all
I know sometimes it get hard
Keep your head up mami, reach for the stars
Having a child is like a blessing from God
You just gotta work hard, can't let your youngest star strip in that bar
I feel your pain, this shit is ripping my heart
But where and when do we start, listen to the voice in back of my mind
Can't reach all my women so I attack it in rhyme
I know what you're feelin', I'm wiping your tears ma, it could happen in time
For now I take your tear, strife, suffering, imagine it mine, huh",https://genius.com/The-game-promised-land-lyrics

Untold Story,West Coast Resurrection,2005.0,"Niggas don't really want it, just talkin out the side of they neck
How many gangsters you know, ain't scared of death
That's why I, ride with tecs, soon as I pull 'em out
Breathe easy nigga they tryin to get them bullets out
It was all good a week ago, you was callin shots in the hood
Bitch now you sold rock in the hood
Used to be a gang leader, now your gang need ya
But no more rocks or dope spots in the hood
Ghost town, niggas won't even walk in your hood
I want respect like when niggas is talkin to Suge
You cats gon' get with that, or get with the +Mac+
And I ain't talkin 'bout Beans, talkin 'bout this gat
The kid still a hundred miles and runnin
Niggas smoke 10 boxes of Newports, when they know I'm comin
And fuck MTV, I live in The Real World
Call my guns R. Kelly, they'll touch your lil' girl, cause
(x2)
Layin with dogs, you gon' wake up with fleas
Fuckin with rats, you'll never get yo' cheese
You know J cats, like to sell you dreams
And a snake gon' scheme (and a killa will do anything)

It's a done deal, Seth's back, makin it hot
No questions, I'm takin my spot
Project walls, hoods and blocks, Get Low, we hard to stop
JT, and the Game is hot
It's so necessary, these dudes are so scary
When I cruise through Bentley Coupe that's cherry
Tailored suits and gators, man, laughin at these haters
Man, show me the money then, pay me man
It's a new day, same team, I'm still the ghost
Big crib, jet skis and boats, listen close take notes
Mink coats and diamond clusters
West coast we nothin but hustlers
We grimy and gritty, cool like dat, old school fools
Willy Ness throwbacks, we send tricks to the nearest track

Baggage Claim,UnKnown,2011.0,"I be down in lil Haiti, bagin a lil weezy and a lil baby
In a drop top Mercedes, I'm not what your used to
I'm a lil koo-koo, I'll put this 9 on your head like a fucking bluetooth
And let the smoke from the Benz exhaust blend with
The smoke from the cough cuz that marijuana I'm smoking
Mary J what's the 411, call guidos people I need 4 more guns
And shoutout to LL for no fucking reason
Cuz he the reason Def Jam was ever breathing
Number one, you niggas can't fuck with son
Number two, new DJs don't have a clue
Number three, to ever to be a real MC
You have to go back to '88 and battle Kool G
Then battle Cool Jay with Cool Herp judging
I'm the opposite of the levy in New Orleans, I'm not budging
Niggas talking bout they cars, nigga I got a dozen
You couldn't see Game if you were Chris Paul cousin
While we talking 'bout cousin, if you was cousin
Then I'll be blooding, so you still ain't saying nothing
I'm coming outta customs, on the phone with Busta
Lil duffle bag boys, I'm swimming in trust funds
So trust that its fun, let ms. white scholar (?)
And this white collar touch my ones
Jay got married, whatup b
I wish I could of threw the rice, just like salt to me
And I'm right where I ought to be
Across from Jack Nickolson nigga playoff seats
Whatup Bynum, how's that playoff ...(?)
Next time-out tell Kobe run the play-off me
Cuz I dribbled in hallways all day, did drive-bys in broad day
And I lost a homie in a car chase
Think I'm bullshitting, call Face, call Mase
I'm a ghetto boy nigga i grew up on Scarface
Call Nas, how that Cuban cigar taste
Ask about the homie Suge, I'll blow the smoke in your face
Now wouldn't it be gangsta if i knocked out the nigga that hit him
At the club throw up a motherfucking dub
Im an animal around these parts, I'm a cannibal around your heart
Hannibal chewing through cantaloupe
Couldn't find a doctor I had to make my own antidote
Never detox and I blow it like Barry Manelope
Cali Cronic Purple Haze, twisting up a back wood
Thinking bout when I was running through 50s back woods
In Connecticut my etiquette was gangsta
Damn, I was right there when he dropped ""Wanksta""
The good old days, smoking the good old jays
Rocking good old Jays, the nigga proof or the number fours
I like the number nines, them shits were hot in the summertime
Keep playing I'll put your ass up under mine

Yea, yea, yea…2010 windows on this red Ferrari

Hand on my nuts nigga (ohhh shit)
Solo cause my niggas all locked up in the pen
Here we go again, 2010, 28” rims
Slammed them hardcore like Lil’ Kim
Get money, then me and my entourage is in
So tell ya friend to tell her girlfriend I’m in the Benz
This is a Dope Boyz car, bought it with coke cash
& prior this gat, it came with 4 stashes
Get money, fuck bitches, this is my life
She blowin’ today, in 5 years this is your wife
& you can’t handle that, gimme that ace of spades nigga
This is a bottle Jack, bring it back to VIP & swallow that
Holler back, used to sell crack where the college at
When I got low, I re-up where they shoot them hollows at
Same hood, same guns, same tee, same one’s
Who said ‘cause I’m saggin’ in these jeans that I can’t run?

Standin’ on the corner straight slangin’ rocks
Here comes the crooked ass cops, crooked, crooked ass cops
Aww, straight slangin’ rocks
Aww, here comes the crooked ass cops
Standin’ on the corner straight slangin’ rocks
Here comes the crooked ass cops, crooked, crooked ass cops

Getting me some, D.R.E. some, Skateboard B some
Starmap nigga, I’m back with a vengeance
Call that happy feet but I don’t fuck with the penguins

Got a warrant out but that’s just R.E.D. Album promo
Tell ‘em like Will, tell ‘em nigga come & get meee
Blowin sticky green & I can feel it in my kidney
Chillin in the wind & ain't got no common sense
The way that I’m jumpin & swervin inside this Bentley
I am simply a natural born killer
Nigga tempt me, leave this fuckin’ choppa all empty
Yea I did it, that’s purple haze lemme hit it
Hide the smoke under my BBC fitted & I’m


I be chillin’ by the (?) now, right by the mill shop
They want Game locked up ‘cause that’ll make the jail hot
Call my nigga Pharrell cause that’ll make my bail pop
California love, I hold it down well Pac
Much love to Brooklyn, got these haters shell-shocked
Roll my L’s in Harlem, cause that was Big L’s spot

H3, Dre beats beatin like the drummer line
Rollin’ with my niggas, peace to my bitches
Lets have a pool party & go swimmin’ in my riches

Walk Wit Me,G.A.M.E,2006.0,"Hey yo the kid still at it, woke up from that coma
Seen hell came back and here comes my first classic
Still chop it up at the table, still put dope in the bag
And still got dope, under the mattress
It was hustle before rappin, nuttin before that and
12 years old, a lost soul, bumpin ""Illmatic""
Gunshots tried and almost took the young kid's live
Can't do it I been through it the young kid survived
Got the ghetto on my shoulder homey, it's gon' be a long ride
Bear with me, I'mma take you there with me
Show you how the sun shine in one rhyme, no more stormy weather
Streets is mine, we gon' live forever
Get it together 'Pac is watchin, Big is listenin
Eazy is talkin to us, Big Pun is witnessin
While they souls still glistenin in ghettos from Compton to Brooklyn
The shells cry, every hood's anthem
Where everybody goes to church and prayers are never answered
And they throwin us curveballs but we Hank Aarons
A picture with no canvas, streets are so skanless
Young'uns jump rope, play ball with fiends and dope handlers
Teenage mothers, deadbeat fathers, no families
Lost and often runaway or live with grandparents
Life stories with no authors, see it through, {?} Robinson's cubicles
When time life is so beautiful
Walk with me we can make it if we try, lost soldiers sometimes
We gotta die but it's okay to cry
Mothers strugglin tryin to survive, reach out grab my hand
I got'cha, won't let you go for nuttin, I promise
Praises due to Elijah Muhammad, peace be unto Farad Muhammad
Words of Minister Farrakhan
Been true, be loyal, know your roots, water your soil
Stop fightin amongst ourself from birth we royal
Who's king we fightin over a crown, while lifeguards
Watch the hopes and dreams of kids and young teens drown
More infants bein born with AIDS, more parents mournin graves
The plot thickens, somebody show us the way
Tears crackin the pavement, streets breakin up
The thrill is gone and it's a long walk home
So we might as well start runnin, if it's there gotta take it
'Member Jada said ""We Gon' Make It""
And it shouldn't take 9/11 to bring our minds together
Shit rough we'll grind together
Light a candle we can shine forever or I can pass
So I won't miss Aaliyah's concert in heaven
Live life while we listen to my old heads
So I glow like the memory of Lisa 'Left Eye' Lopez
Through a six-seven Brougham, ride with me through the hood mayne
Where street lights flicker and Chuck Taylors hang
And nobody know they neighbor's name 'less they sell weed or cocaine
A lot of black clouds on a block but no rain
And Game got a lot to say, so they wanna take me down
In my own front yard like Marvin Gaye
Can't do it by myself, people need help
Keep on tryin to live healthy 'til the end of my days
And when I die won't lead my daughter astray, lookin from heaven
Watch my people drive my coffin through the Compton parade",https://genius.com/The-game-walk-wit-me-lyrics

Rob and steal, my niggas will peel at will
For real they real, niggas gon' feel this steel

Walk with me through the ghetto where the packs get sold
And them niggas sellin the work ain't half as old

Other hand grip the semi, c'mon walk with me

I'm from Compton, Compton, a block from hell
And you can come get a bird for eleven
And we ain't got a penny for the reverand, a dime for a witness

You fuckin with the Hub City Hustler
The vans on the block won't touch us, the streets my home
So I move weight on the block like I'm Moses Malone
Bring the guns anywhere I roam, go with the chrome
And I hit all my shots, like I'm in the A.I. zone
And mob like Al Capone through N.W.A.'s home
Homes like Ed Jones will cripple your team up
In the home of Dr. Dre, Venus and Serena
Where 14-year-olds pack ninas and drive Beamers
We ball up subpeonas, take niggas to the cleaners
And you know what I'm talkin about if y'all seen where..


We drug dealin, but niggas is squealin (fuck you rats)
What more can I say, just kill 'em
Fuck 'em, the gun bust 'em, we just knock on wood
Now is this under-stooooooood?
I mostly George when I whip, my supply is good
The man behind the bricks, I'm supplyin the hood
Catch bodies like Pistol Pete passes on the wood
Benz parked by the fence, brick stashed in the hood
Top work by the inch, I bag it, it's gone
Ask Quik, we rock more than microphones
Some niggas ball, some niggas do what we do
And other niggas sing for Cash Money like TQ
The block will heat and sink you (hey dude)
Cali ain't all palm trees, purple haze and sea dude
Lose your life tryin to get these jewels

I grew up on Santana block, that's where the Crips was
My mama house was in the middle of the street
How was a nigga supposed to get to school
I hopped every backyard on my block
Till I got to Elm Street, took the rag out my sock
And I could have been a Crip but I ain't like blue that much
All Crip school, I ain't really go to school that much
I was selling crack on Elm, bagging up sacks on Elm
With the ratchet in my boogie jacket giving you the facts on
We was fighting over territory with the T Flats on Elm
I had to scrap on Elm, that's how I got my stripes
Air Max 95s not a scratch on my Nikes
2016 motherfucker don't you pull it
Cause I made it out of Compton with a stab wound and five bullets

Don't trip on me, don't trip on me

Cause I went to Compton High Crip School like that
I was Blood and I ain't really like blue like that
They was Crippin they ain't give a fuck who like that
Them niggas jumped me why they have to do a ru like that

Blacksox, oh boy!  Hooked up with Get Low Records
Puttin this shit together, my nigga

It ain't a nigga in the game that could hold me down
I've been independent forever so they know me now
And I'm the cat they gotta find when they wanna get signed
You wanna get your paper right you gotta study my grind
I'm like Rush in ""Krush Groove,"" a nigga that bust moves
Right out, and tuck tools, bullets that bust dudes
Ain't no beef in the briefcase, just beef for Pete's sake
We round up cats, to beat 'em in a street race
We count paper up, to make a nigga change his plans
They under weight so they ain't gettin off they gram
You mad at my boys, cause we choppin 'em in
They make twenty then the Fig want 10

The block boys stay high, California stock with K-5

Them block boys stay high, the California K-5

Huh, it's the Blacksox doin a joint together
The whole world stoppin to listen, ol' breakers poplockin to this
And white boys headboppin in 6's, niggas boxin in prison

Shorty sucked me out of my Timbs

Anyway, I heard you workin for vice
You ain't real man you hide behind ice
Youse a impostor, snatch him off the roster
Always live by the rule, get dough, or die trying
Hardcoded into shinin

Listen rookie, don't make me mad boy

And when the beef cook, I'ma put the piece to your head
And if you see a white truck that mean yo' sheets is dead

Ask the republicans how crack cocaine get smuggled in

Pull niggas cars throw up signs and bang Nas

While we fuck their hoes and stay out the windows of propellors

Still holla at Nas on the daily, only thing missin'

You do the math, ten shots, ten dead bodies
Fuck bein sorry, it ain't nuttin but a gangsta party
And I'll make sure ain't a nigga survivin
Shoot up the ambulance, make sure it ain't a nigga there to revive him
And the Game ain't tryin to win, fuck the awards
So keep that little-ass horn, and that Neil Armstrong nigga


Trust me dog, ain't shit you can put in your rap
That'll make you a gangsta, you a bitch and that's that
Niggas thinkin I retired my Chuck, put the gun back in the holsters
Cause I weave through traffic in a roaster
But that don't stop the heater from bangin, or me comin through
Droppin all y'all niggas with three in the chamber
Keep two mac-10's when I'm rollin, one in the changer
One when I push the button's right next to the cupholder
Dog we can get this shit over, I got ten on the Game
Let's say that Lee Harvey crack ya brain
Ain't gotta look over my shoulder, I'm good with the aim
Good with the handle and the bullet's good with the bloodstains
And the coroner's real good with that pickup
A1 good with the carpet cleaning, they can get the rest of that shit up
Cause I kill like the hiccups, two at a time
Put you niggas next to each other how I do 'em in line


Come through in a big boy, leave the bullshit at home
If beef cook then I'm bringin the chrome
If I die then I'm leavin a clone; but if I live
Through the drama one mo' time then them boys gotta dig
When I think about who shot me, I listen to Big
When I'm rhymin on the road, I listen to Jig
Bump Nas off that purple, sittin on the block
And when I'm loadin up them clips, I listen to 'Pac
A semi with me like Eddie Murphy, got mo' guns
Than F-A, B-O, L-O, U-S got jerseys
And you might get 'em all in the face when shit get thick
Make the back of your head look like Jerome Kearsey
And ain't nuttin to do a driveby in the hood
We ain't even got survival, but I'mma still take that ride
Bet my drink on it, bet my main squeeze mink on it

BK to CPT,UnKnown,2002.0,"Straight outta Compton, Chuck Taylor in Brooklyn, 8 deep
And the Desert Storm blew in Ghetto F-A-B
The only difference between us is the coast and the lift of the ninas
And the rainbow paint on the Beamer
Out here they call me All Star Game
And every nigga with a gun waitin for the oak floor all star game
So while you in the Staples parking lot
I'm watchin' the corner with the safety on like Ronnie Lott

Straight outta Brooklyn, it's the same youngin, slingin' the same onions
Smokin' that Cali bud that my nigga Game brung in
I keep a dame tongin' my dick, a chain hung to my dick
The Caine run by the brick, it's ghetto
The fame sprung on me quick
But I still got 20s of dope that'll have your brain strung on a fix
These haters can't stop the rock I pushes
Cause a nigga move around with more arms than an octopus's
Nigga

I got a Winchester that'll turn your vest into confetti
I'm Chuck Taylor the same nigga that put the '64 in Chevy
It's the same nigga to keep the .44 in the Chevy
With no stash spot, when you in Compton ask coppers
If that Aston Martin the same color as grasshoppers
I'm runnin' the rock, not Jay, Dame Dash or Hoffa
So when you in Compton you know who to ask for
That twenty-year-old young gun with bricks in the Jaguar
Nigga

Jay push Bentley ISR's through
And if you seen my guns you'd think Bush sent me to war too
Even with chicks beggin' me for dick regularly
A nigga known for gettin' rid of weight like Dick Gregory
I'm New York City's fly guy, you bums don't impress me
I already got the lead, waitin' for someone to test me
And you don't wanna be in the news
Cause when we lookin' for you, not even Bin Laden would wanna be in your shoes, nigga

Every ghetto in America I know that niggas lettin' clips fly
So I keep that in mind when I'm out in the NY
Niggas see the Aftermath chain they like ""F 50""
Cause we flyin' through Queens in that Ferarri F-50
Bitches see me in the video, wanna have sex with me
So I keep a box of Magnums and a bag of X with me
Keep a .38 Magnum stashed in the Vette with me
And it's ""fuck your life!"" if you ain't signin' checks with me

Nigga I'm eatin' and you be snackin' like you on a diet
That's why you window shoppin' actin' like you wanna buy it
Actin' like you want a riot, like you gon' shoot
When I'm back you gon' be quiet
Like you on mute
That's proof you a punk
And you're lucky there ain't enough room to fit a nigga in my roof and the trunk
They got a box to quickly hide the gun
You shouldn't move, if you seen Boyz N the Hood and knew Ricky tried to run

Niggas know when them hollows airin'
I'll turn your Antoine Walker to a throwback Robert Parish
With two holes under the Celtic
And you would think your Boston warm up jacket hot till the Desert Eagle melt it
I'm a gangsta and the birds they love it
Twenty with a baby face and sit on base like Kirby Puckett
You can't afford the new Bentley? Fuck it
Cop yay from Jay, the bricks come with Louis Vuitton luggage

In my 'hood the slower you move the quicker they get you
Sometimes it's somebody in the click that be with you
That's why my vest is thicker to get through
And I keep two nine's on my shirt like Dickerson's shit do
I waste my breath when I'm bickering with you
I'd rather waste my techs till they flicker and hit you
You sick as my shit blue
And you ain't goin' nowhere for a while, a commercial where Snickers'll fit you, fucker

Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party when I'm spittin' to Pac
The paint fall off your Miss King when I'm spittin' the Glock
Before I was sixteen I was liftin' a drop
Spittin' on cops, pitchin' the rock
Like Charlie Ward before the New York Knicks
Now you can catch me in Brooklyn with Fab on a New York bitch
While you old niggas in rehab
And if I can't be a hip hop legend I'll just die in a ski mask

When a gangsta like me ride it be suede in it, be shade tinted
Tires got the rims that Spree made in it
One of the prettiest hoes be laid in it
Blowin' the kid faster than prepaid minutes
I'm guessin' these haters don't know I keep the Wes in the ators
Fully loaded with the vest penetrators
But if they want it, y'all can get it
You love the way the coaster coast chiefs did it",https://genius.com/The-game-bk-to-cpt-lyrics

Yo whats up yall' this is Doug E. Fresh, and I got my boy Big Daddy Kane, and KRS-One is in here
And Game , matter fact Game you know what 

Razor sharp
My flow is like a crip and blood fightin' in the park
, come to Compton swim with the sharks
I know the real kings of New York
That make me five borough
Thorough pass me the torch
A young Kane
I'm insane my membrane has the capacity to jack rappers and take chains
A lot of fake KRS' a lot of fake Game's
I'ma cash in on you n****s and make change
Little ass dogs I'm a Great Dane
Product of hip hop like spray paint on a freight train
And while you n****s tried to make Kane
I made Kane
While Kane playin' on that little tape thang
I got my first boom box in 85'
Carrying that heavy mothe f****r I was maybe 5
Or maybe 6
So what I'm tryin' to tell you
Is I've been fucking with hip-hop since the 80's bitch

KRS-One spits like...
Doug Fresh beat box like rhaaa
And you know that kane spit like...
And that's the reason game spit like...

Rappers don't like when KRS on tour
Cause when I rhyme they wrist don't glist no more
All you see is that dark ___?
And these rappers promoting all this rape and war
I'm ignorant when I'm on tour
They say I'm down to irk? cause I put rappers brains on the floor
You heard that song chicken noodle soup
Thats what you head gon' look like in the back of your coupe
Like some one threw up in your rear view
After you battle KRS-One no ones ever gonna wanna hear you
Notice the style of music you loose it
I'll scald your face like them cats in Houston
You know it's funny how you love to talk
But still stuck in the hood I rose above New York
I be in the Bronx eating pounds of kush?
You're like a fag in front of the pussy - beating around the bush


Hey yo
You ain't got no other choice but to like it or love it
When you see me with the game it's nothing like Michael Douglass
The black costa knowsta?
He who got the mosta
The toxic flows and yall' lames is not supposed ta
I spit it clearly
My styles the shitterary?
When I write about cats it's called obituaries
I never fuck with lame so don't bring that n***a near me
I'm universal
Your deafest jam is a subsidiary
One question playa who want see
There really somethin' real spit it two blunt leaf
I locked down the East and opened new country
And ran through the West when it was mostly 2-1-3 (chhhhh)
Look om? I took one to Brook non?
I look calm but I gotta enough hoods to start a crook farm?
The guard? is in the buildin and yes problems
When yall find chicks all I do is test drive em'


Uh, now let em tell yall' something
See this whole thing came together in a special way, ya know what I mean
A very very special way
You just got the legends man, together
And you just created...a whole nother' level
Because on the real...game straight up talk...from an MC perspective B
You are definitely...official, a legend and respected because you come from the heart
And that's what a real MC do
No matter what
And this was all just one night in the studio man jus hanging out
That's what we did
Thats what happened
And you know
(beat boxing)
This is real man
(beat boxing)
This is all day
(beat boxing)
This is hip hop
(beat boxing)
Til the very last drop uh
And let me tell ya' the last thing, imma' tell ya'
It's about original creation, from the heart
See an MC
Knows without
Ever
Tryin' to be somebody else
Just do you thing
And it will always work out

When Shit Get Thick,Untold Story,UnKnown,"Who really the best rapper since 'Pac got killed
I done answered that question when I copped my deal
Ask yourself when the Game is comin, after next summer
I predict my shit'll drop before the next Howard homecoming
Now who in the runnin, no one, ask the niggas who want it
I got a four-fifth and it just like me, it stay gunnin
Me and my niggas stay blunted fogged up in the 600
Guilty as charged, blunts in the air, guns in the doors
It's written, Compton niggas never run from the law
Plus we get Monopoly money with hotels and a board
So I'll never see a jail, and I'm allergic to bars
Can't sit behind 'em or drink at 'em, so we travel with ours
Poppin Crist' in the 6, like we drivin through Mardi Gras
Thinkin 'bout beads and titties as I roll through the city
And I keep 16 in the clip, and I let 'em all go
Like the Lakers did Ellie, Atty and Nick, huh

When shit get thick, niggas start dyin
Bodies pop up in dumpsters, mothers start cryin
Payback come through violent, nigga
We hit blocks, bust shots, leave ya whole block silent, cause
When shit get thick, niggas start dyin
Bodies pop up in dumpsters, mothers start cryin
Payback come through violent, nigga
We hit blocks, bust shots, leave ya whole block silent

No garbage, we smoke molta, move big cocoa
We off the train tracks like the great space coaster
We hit real big and consistant like Sam Sosa
Prepare for war, like United States soldiers
Lock tight and rock right like grey eight oz's
I'll be hittin up spots, in them flip Range Rovers
Before you even try to play, foolish all over
Empty out yo' pockets, turn everything over
We ball out cursin yeah we keep it the sickest
When we roll by the quads in them Z-66's
Big spittin, grip kitten, that big face greed
Always dirty never clean but we live like kings
Legendary like Sting, it's a history to follow
But not known for stingin known for gettin off hollows
Shoot me a glass of Remy, nah fuck it the whole bottle
And watch me act bad and take off, full throttle


I'm from a batch where it ain't no cut, we all in
36 on a triple beam scale for meal
Duffle bag on my shoulder my route, through the back of the jet
To bag up baguettes and everybody know it
I'm the iceholder makin the cut, never breakin 'em up
My favorite color is rainbowed up
Ain't a coke dealer, but I got bricks for cheap
Hit the lab for a fo' day block, we got heat
You niggas can't compete when I walk in the streets
We Get Low, and there's no idea with the info
It's a rule of thumb, let them dudes a come
I'm cruisin some, 20 inch shoes and some
I'm in the widebody XM-5, all my snakes is live
We check your five, the spot where the tec dies
And everybody gotta holla the name

And these ain't diesel, all fucking Evisu
These is Levi's, equipped with the desert eagle
Run, tell your people, that nigga get evil
Throw em off the bridge like Knievel
You niggas see-through
Like lingerie pussies I get funky like D.O.C. do
One classic, now homie, OG too
I toast a chronic blunt everytime I see Snoop
Aston Martin Driver, gave away the B(entley) Coupe
Cried for three days, after that I had to re-group
Bullet-proof suburban, nigga fuck with that
Shoot the tires out, drive 60 miles on a flat
Flip the motherfucker over watch it slide on its back
Let the windows up as bullets fly out the Mac
No gunpowder on me, I'm as fly as the Mac

I kill at will

But am back on those gold wires burning rubber off the same tires
My flow is so reckless
I stay around legends LLs old neckless
Eat rock him take for breakfast?
What a spit out makes djs blow the dust off the old records
Time to dust off the old lexus
I'm just trying to ball and rap like r tess is (am all texas)?
Am screwed up
It's hard to make moves when your stuck on the block like tetris
I'm so caught up in who the best is
I got drunk in the studio and caught maself trying to text B I G
Cause MC in is dead throw up your lights
Hip hop style? for the ghost rider
I've been writing on my own
Since I was just a kid (THE BLACK FRANK SINATRA)
I've been writing on my own
Since I was just a kid I swear to you
I will never do what these rappers do
How many of u bust a** rappers know what a MC is
What MCS do what MCS did
U should shake the hand of a real MCS kid
And kiss the mother f***er ground where us MCS live
I've been writing my s*** slice and s*** dice and s***
Rachael ray with a knife and s***
Niggers still bite my s***e
I'm a professor with words all the law studants like my s***
Confess what a heard na am gonna bite ma lip
And turn my ghost riding check into ice on my wrist
I'm hardcore hardcore like throwing dice on the bricks
Hardcore like a knife with that junior mafia b****
She had a ghost rider but shes a b****
Nigga u got a ghost rider cause u a b****
I should jab this mother f***ing pencil in your throat

My Confessions,Westside Story,2004,"This is my confession, you can take time to listen
Or turn your back on me, but this is my confession
The life of a troubled child Who grew up to be a gangsta
Look at me now

How the fuck would you feel? If you had to share every meal
Every night, with your foster brothers and sisters
I think about my mom and I missed her
Nights after watching the A-Team, when I kissed her
I use to want to be Mr. T, or Murdock
Which one was it? uhh... then I heard shots
It must be coming from 133rd block
Where them West side Piru niggas birds pop
And the Crips ain't far away
You got Nutty Blocc, Grape Street, and the PJs
Where niggas 15 years old with beers like Freeway
And you can die over he say and she say
Like ""your cousin told my brothers baby momma""
That Game done started that drama
In the projects, yeah the same ones that they said Carmelo got robbed at
But I talked to him, he said it didn't happen
Nigga you play ball, I'll be the rapper

(..give a fuck about these NBA ass niggas anyway
I ain't make it, I play ball, nigga I'm jealous nigga
You don't play for the Lakers anyway punk)

This is my confession, you can take time to listen
Or turn your back on me, but this is my confession
The life of a troubled child Who grew up to be a gangsta
Look at me now
(Verse 2: Lil Eazy-E)
Everybody wanna know about Eazy son
'Til I raise my white T and they seen the gun
Yeah, the second comin' of a nigga with an attitude
Out of compton 100 miles, wild and running
Kelly Park to the Rucker, they dont like me to fuck em
This shit in my blood, so I'ma die a hustla
Its nothing When we ride through your 'hood busting
That '64 impala the same color as mustard
Eric Wright Jr. nigga the shoe fit
Never thought I'd be in New York fucking with Whoo Kidd
You niggas is stupid, homie I'm the blueprint
Blue chucks on Greenleaf walkin' a blue pit
745 same blue tint
The diary of a mad man, here's my 2 cents
I stare at my pop's eyes when he was in his last days
How he go in for bronchitis, and die from AIDS?
Fuck that!",https://genius.com/The-game-my-confessions-lyrics
Run Up ft. Ice Cube & YG,UnKnown,UnKnown,"West Coast, it's all about survival nigga
West Coast, California's own
Black Wall Street, D.P.G.C
You niggas know what it is
Compton and Long Beach back together again

Security pat downs
I'm a star, motherfucker, I been put the gat down
I been put' the MAC down
But check the people that I'm with
'Cause they'll lay you flat down
And they'll do it right now
Yeah, you scared of the phone numbers that a nigga might dial
Club-hop, car shows, picnics
Big cars, big jewels, big dicks
Rush doors, or gotta hop the fence
, gotta blow my rent
Gotta show my ass, then go repent
Gotta call in sick, and tell 'em where I went
(buck em, buck 'em, buck 'em)
Don't want no problems, ya'll
Fuck around, I'll pull out the problem solved
And watch egos dissolve
Nine times out of ten, you hoes involved

You gotta problem nigga run up
They get  go be 
 give a fuck, I'ma do my thang
Representing the city from which I came

It's too much gangsta shit goin' on in the fuckin' world
For niggas to be actin' like girls
I'm the Gangbang General, never rhyme a subliminal
12-gauge shotty to your body, a fuckin' criminal
A animal, West Coast beat cannibal
Who got the antidote? I'm sick on this gangsta shit
Not Blood or Crip, I'm a Anybody Killa
For realer, half Blood half motherfuckin' gorilla
Suicidal, my flow is a automatic rifle
My rag is a flag, I should hang it from the fuckin' Eiffel, Tower
MC's I devour, a lyrical time bomb
I explode to the next episode
Cutlass ridin', butler drivin'
Head low cause it's all about motherfuckin' survivin'
In the city I claim, Westside we bang
The Game, and the D.P.G.C. gang

Goin' goin' back back to the bank
Rest in peace to my safe
I'ma fly nigga nigga I take your ho
I'll have to leave her if she did me like Coco
The devil talkin' to me, but I dont hear him
Act like I'm deaf like So-So
Fuck you, fuck him, fuck them
Fuck my ex and her cohorts
Hundred bottles in the club, for no reason
Niggas start trippin', boom bow dope fiend
Fendi on my shoes, Fendi on my belt
I'm in the Fendi store, I dont need help
All gold everything like Trinidad
I went to high school, with you bitch you been a rat
I don't got money problems, I got trust issues
Two things I gotta stayin' with, two pistols",https://genius.com/The-game-run-up-ft-ice-cube-and-yg-lyrics
"Welcome to california (feat. skeme, stacy barthe, schoolboy q, too $hort)",UnKnown,UnKnown,"(Chorus)
Too high, can't come down
Losing my head, spinning round and round
Round and round
Round and round

Back to the hoes
Ridin' down 7-4th and Hoover with my nigga ScHoolboy
Cadillac and a coupe
See them niggas hatin from afar, can't catch em know
But they getting smacked when we do
Ra ta ta like we snoop
Crown on the vic
Crown on my wrist, crown on my bitch
And a couple crowns on my crew
Keeping pounds of the blue
Ivory in it, tsunami in it when I be in it
Got the lobby in it, Tommy in it
The trunk got a body in it
Niggas be like he bodying it
Ziplock full of J's, closet full of J's walking on
My crib and he's Scotty in it
Bath tub big enough to fit a Audi in it
8 gold chains like it's already in it
Murder with the ink, I'm Gotti in it
Don't get too popped if yo ass 2 Pac
Cargos with the 12 gauge shotty in it
Plus I still got a crib on Brazil
I ain't never holly that but I got a Maserati in it
That's my new addition, nobody in it
Chop shops in the hood, no karate in it
So much money, got a money tree
Whoop so many niggas' ass, shit we money team
Same fuck niggas with they hand out
Same stacks on, bring the bands out
Nigga should be workin on they money skeme
Back to the convers, kill em with one verse
Converse with the worst til one of our gun burst
Callin Archurelli, tell him niggas in one hearse
'Cus Compton ain't like the city of commerce
No back talk, back wall, end up in asphalt
Niggas love them choppas like we flyin in black cars
But you with the roost, thinkin a nigga was black though
Now hold that thought
Motherfuckers wanna act loco
Hit em with numerous shots from the 4-4
Motherfuckers wanna act loco
Hit em with numerous shots from the 4-4
(Chorus)
Too high, can't come down
Losing my head, spinning round and round
Too high, can't come down
Losing my head, spinning round and round

Pray for me, I'll make 30
Desert, even my nails dirty
I'mma think on life and I'd die for it
Made a mill, you ain't even know it
Tell Iluminati I'm down for it
Call Jigga, I'm next nigga
Some niggas my new litter
Fuck the world on earth day
Her booty clap on my birthday
I would take the cake but I've been paid
I'm a real nigga, you's arcade
Had a switch blade in the 5th grade
Smoked plenty weed on my mama's couch
Now I'm going big, I can buy the house
You sell water down, I sell low for ounce
See this for adults who say where you from
If those hoes who gonna make me cum
With them fuck niggas we don't fuck around
And fuck niggas gonna lose a lot
Knock knock nigga, come feel the drama
If the bed low I'mma stack the crown
Up the contraband in-between my gun
Before smoking dope I was selling coke
Well rocked up to a 8 year old
When it popped up, call it pot luck
500 G's, nigga pretty please
Condos, where it's sun and trees
10 keys with my 8 G's
Hoover hats like the star of David
Pull on shots unless kidney faded
Rent a pony, might go with Emmett
Move out the set but the set I'm banging
(Chorus)
Too high, can't come down
Losing my head, spinning round and round
Too high, can't come down
Losing my head, spinning round and round

Look, a young nigga really tryna stunt, fuck it
West side neighbors and I ain't budging
Independent niggas with no budget
If it ain't about a dollar gotta change subjects
Rap ass niggas ain't seen nothing
This flow here, niggas can't touch it
Motherfuck friends, tinted windows on the Benz
Doing doughnuts in the bitch got me trippin like a bucket
Shots going off in the streets
10 hut, big squads are with me
See niggas 12 ballin like they been in the gym
But you lookin like a novice to me, now quit talkin to me
Can I vet? All you niggas sound retarded to me
Killin these niggas, I'm a general nigga
Turn yo head to target for free
Now I'm on, look at me
Started, started with them pesos and palm trees
Now when niggas come through the wood niggas gotta know that that's all me
See the set catch rap
When I slide through throwin up a bill
And niggas wanna act like they thuggin like, we said boy please
This S to the K to the E to the E nigga
New Rolls go vroom nigga
Got a 5 cocked back like boom nigga
Got enough room to fill up a room nigga
And I'm all in these, had 100 a go
Gave her that dick now she beggin for more
Pay me a millie, yo bitch load is illie
But I ain't got, still got 100 to go
And I do it, I does it
I swear that you love it
I just left from Newark, got bands in my luggage
Play with you rappers, my nigga
This black mack
Take out my dick, take a piss on the public like fuck it

Too high, can't come down
Losing my head, spinning round and round
Too high, can't come down

Nigga done run everywhere
Left trails in my city everywhere
But nowhere like home
See I won't killed when on
Bitch come and dust my throne
Stand from grandmother's porch to my executive Porsche
Now I'm driving through London alone
With a Parisian bitch
Rockin corn rolls, backseat of my Panamera watchin pornos
Where we goin?
What we doin?
Fly to Johannesburg
Nigga city in ruins then fly to Dubai
On my poolside, coolin my Audemar
You waterproof fuckin gone, let em know that I admit
Everywhere around the world and that's cool
But can a hotel fuckin reserve us parked through
My hood gorillas move whenever sharks move
Move to back to Compton shit, we are too
Condos and wheels to shit, I bought two
Livin down the street where BIG got shot, I hunt you
And the very next day where Pac met his fate
It's how we live our life, surrounded by Che, pause
(Verse)
Where the angels fly, city of angels, I will never let you down
Kill anything approaching my crown
Still undefeated
That's why I got my kids building sand castles on the beaches
But don't get it confused, said he still got moves
Where the wrong colors niggas end up on the news like Sal
Like Durant in a dream then I'm right back down Compton avenue in a Buick
If you had the hot niggas put a bullet through it
And it took a coma for you to be king would you do it?
Would you do it?
If I dropped you off at Watts would you walk through it?
Would you be from great street or would you Piru it?
Here's my red raggers that's ain't nothing to it
There go the 60's, motherfucker good luck
(Welcome to California bitch)
They were the 60's, motherfucker good luck

From the corner where that ho said that hit kat
Short dress, head and that bizac
You know me with my thumb in my index
Nah, I ain't bloodin nigga
Pass blunts to my cousins nigga
Turn hale into gold, I can pon the river
High power, you a amish liver
Cali dro in my lungs and such
Twisted blunts from dawn to dusk
My shoe box should've been a armored truck
Everything good, feeling marvelous
Came to the city, that you honored us
You don't talk me a game, no game homie
Get greedy with the clip, no aim on it
Uh, Mr. 3rd degree
Burn like the bridge and yo business uh
Started at the floor, at the beginning uh
Now I rep the floor until the ending uh
Smoking on ills cuz I'm winnin
Wax getting blowed, just the pin lit
Uh, yea now back to the booth, back to the hoes
Ra ta ta in the lap with the 2
No Cali J, I still ran all blow
All in the trim, straight lookin like you
Free tattoo

I'm in the gangsta shit, gangsta clothes and gangsta crib
Need a gangsta bitch to take the dope and hop the fence
Might die on the freeway
Hey, much love to the he way, aye
Watch you know about LA?

Stay low from the comas
Make a right fore they dome us

Stay low from the comas

And I swear I'mma bring her to the set if she will
And if I do the pussy better killin
Just the way I make her feel, no step in they mills

I came up in a world where it's kill or be killed
I swear that every bitch I used to fuck fuck me still
Just give a dick, never covered a bill
This shit is real, this west side INGFCF
Bands on them bitches, getting M's on them bitches
Going for the Cartier, hands on the bitches
Last long like I'm using extends on them bitches
I'm a native, I got real niggas with me
Gold state, gold grills, I put on for the Betty White
Middle fingers for the peace
Tell them bitch niggas suck a dick

Put it in the Air,West Coast Resurrection,2005.0,"Who's hot, who's not; I been the hottest thing
On the West, ever since the death of 2Pac
Kept my crack in clear capsules with blue tops
And it's still nothin for me to get you shot
You see him? Yup, the same ol' pimp
Sky baller, and ain't nuttin changed but my limp
Natural born player, mine not a lame or a simp
The world is mine, you see my name on a blimp
Stay Dolce Gabbana'd down, play the Bahamas now
Youse a donkey, I'mma piranha clown
I keep thick bread, in the pockets of my sweats
While I'm drivin I get head in the cockpit of my 'Vette
And my game is sharp as a mosquito's needle
As far as the charts, Young S be's the Beatles
Purple haze smoke in the urr, blow in the wind
The rims right there when I stop they still go and they spin
I can teach you how to stunt boy, and pop that trunk boy
Them city slickers ain't never been punks boy
So fix your ice grill, and your mean mug
Unless you wanna feel a few M-16 slugs
(x2)
Nigga you got a blunt then put it in the air
Nigga you got a gun then put it in the air
Nigga you from a gang then put in in the air
Play with Killa Cali if you want, muh'fuckers

I ain't got no time for fake ones, so don't think for a second
I won't pull this forty-five and put your stomach where your neck is
If I tell you kiss the sky better respect it
Or get yo' ass hog-tied, butt-ass naked
I'm doin this for Eazy, like it or not
I wouldn't even be rappin if Eric Wright wouldn'ta dropped
I love this shit, I work and I'm good
I ain't on corner fuckers but I'm still in the hood
I'm poised to go platinum, that's what the magazines sayin
Fuck The Source, I got my own magazines man
I call her Shirley, she got a 32 round clip
And she love hangin out wit'chu girlies
I'm like them Philly nigs that come through ""Early""
Through your front door without knockin like Mr. Furley
It's just me, you and the semi - ""Three's Company""
You want the crown, you be U.G.K. like Bun B


I rock jewels, cop tools, I will not lose
A million miles a minute is how my block moves
I stay in the fast lane, never fakin, cheddar chasin
I'm in the game for the cash mayne
And bitches play this in they Benzes, Jeeps and G.O.'s
They say I'm arrogant and got a big ego
But they still love to swallow me up
And every hotel suite, they wanna follow me up
But I ain't gon' put my dick in for free, nah ma
You want the kid then you gotta pay this pimpin a fee
And ain't no champagne left, so let's toast 'gnac
Sky baller and Game 'bout to bring the West coast back
I'm on that get dough shit, that Frank War{?} pimpin that ho shit

What Type of Nigga,UnKnown,UnKnown," x2
Real gangstaz stand up, hold they dick
Bitch niggas sit down to piss, what type of nigga is you?
I'm the type to pack a gat or few
Pull out and pop, simply cause I'm mad at you

Y'all niggas see me when I'm come through; and ain't no denyin
That them big motherfuckers is twenty-five
Swayin in and out of white line, six double-oh
Deuce zeroes, I'm feelin like the streets is mine
Mines hustle, mucho dinero, heat's confined
See more fall guys than Foreman/Ali combined
If there's beef, I'm releasin mine
And I won't stop bustin 'til them Escalade seats recline
The kid roll with a greasy nine, come through and blast
I return shots like Arthur Ashe
You do the math, ten shots, ten dead bodies
Fuck bein sorry, it ain't nuttin but a gangsta party
And I'll make sure ain't a nigga survivin
Shoot up the ambulance, make sure it ain't a nigga there to revive him
And the Game ain't tryin to win, fuck the awards
So keep that little-ass horn, and that Neil Armstrong nigga


Trust me dog, ain't shit you can put in your rap
That'll make you a gangsta, you a bitch and that's that
Niggas thinkin I retired my Chuck, put the gun back in the holsters
Cause I weave through traffic in a roaster
But that don't stop the heater from bangin, or me comin through
Droppin all y'all niggas with three in the chamber
Keep two mac-10's when I'm rollin, one in the changer
One when I push the button's right next to the cupholder
Dog we can get this shit over, I got ten on the Game
Let's say that Lee Harvey crack ya brain
Ain't gotta look over my shoulder, I'm good with the aim
Good with the handle and the bullet's good with the bloodstains
And the coroner's real good with that pickup
A1 good with the carpet cleaning, they can get the rest of that shit up
Cause I kill like the hiccups, two at a time
Put you niggas next to each other how I do 'em in line


Come through in a big boy, leave the bullshit at home
If beef cook then I'm bringin the chrome
If I die then I'm leavin a clone; but if I live
Through the drama one mo' time then them boys gotta dig
When I think about who shot me, I listen to Big
When I'm rhymin on the road, I listen to Jig
Bump Nas off that purple, sittin on the block
And when I'm loadin up them clips, I listen to 'Pac
A semi with me like Eddie Murphy, got mo' guns
Than F-A, B-O, L-O, U-S got jerseys
And you might get 'em all in the face when shit get thick
Make the back of your head look like Jerome Kearsey
And ain't nuttin to do a driveby in the hood
We ain't even got survival, but I'mma still take that ride
Bet my drink on it, bet my main squeeze mink on it
Think this shit a joke? Bet the S-5 pink on it",https://genius.com/The-game-what-type-of-nigga-lyrics

And knock both of the screws out the license plate
So let the games begin
These other rappers so far behind me, they could taste my rims
Let the whole turn as the Dayton spin

Hop in the lowrider, long as it got speakers in the back

Call it a lap dance, when the 6 4 bounce that ***

She ain't home, she with Game, homie
Remember that, Dre? You passed me the torch
I lit the *** with it, now the world is my ashtray
Ridin' three-wheel motion 'til the *** scrapes
Turn Sunset into a Daytona drag race
Now watch it bounce, hit the switch
Let it bounce 'til the police shut the strip down
When you hit the club, tell 'em you came with me
We gon' twist up in the V.I.P
It's a new day and if you ever knew Dre
Then homie, you would say I was the new Dre
Same Impala, different strokes
Same ***, just a different smoke

See that's where I come in, the West Coast don
It don't stop niggas
Long as Scott Storch on the motherfuckin' beat
And I put the pen to the pad, I'll tell you what I do
I put the motherfuckin' pen on the pad
I let the motherfuckin' pen go and it start writing itself
That's how motherfuckin' classic my shit be
Everytime around this motherfucka', the Documentary?!
Fuck that album nigga, that wasn't shit
I probably won't even reach my full potential
'Till the next album, but for now?! This what I got

I'm the rawest, most gutter
In the street with the fiends and the coke cutters
Disrespect yo' whole click and I don't stutter
Westside til' I die Compton motherfucka', break it
I be the rawest, most gutter
In the street with the fiends and the coke cutters
Disrespect yo' whole click and I don't stutter
Fuck the world Straight Outta Compton motherfucka'",https://genius.com/The-game-gutter-lyrics
Justo Tribute,"You Know What It Is, Vol. 3",2005.0,"What up? I be the one they call Justo if you didn't know
Trying to check my man DJ Skee with his new mix-tape
Pick it up you square, you heard what I'm said?

It's another sad day in Hip-Hop
We lost another one of our brothers, Justo Faison
We love you, and we'll always miss you
Mix-Tape King, forever

We'll always love you Justo
We'll always love you Justo
We'll always love you Justo
We'll always love you Justo

I picked up my pen four years from the date
Never thought I'd be rapping, and be signed to Dre
Never been to New York, I had to find a way
So I dropped 40 bars on the Clue mix-tape
On the Birdman beat, then my name started buzzing
Aftermath's young gun, and now everybody love him
I hooked up with Gavin, Foxy's little brother
He took me to Kay Slay, and Slay put me on the cover
Drama King, I should of known, cause all of the sudden
MC's calling my name and I'm beefing with Joe Budden
That beef came and went, I got at him over Colors
Then caught him at Def Jam and found out, it was nothing
Looked back at my career, staring out at the City
Thinking about the biddin' war between Dre and Diddy
If I was signed to Bad Boy, would 50 be on the Math?
Probably not but maybe Justo wouldn't have crashed


I remember when Funk Flex first heard me flow
And sway let me freestyle on the wakeup show
Spit over 100 bars then Miss Jones started to host
That's when they start showing me love on the east coast
Then more people found out I was with Dre
And at bodegas I'm on 9 outta 10 of the mix-tapes
I'm workin' on my album and the world can't wait
Cover of the Vibe, and I ain't even have a release date
Then I met Justo he told me if I stay hungry
I'd go platinum and nobody can take that from me
He joked about my rap beefs, I thought it was funny
Gave him a pound then slid him 200 Bars and Runnin'
Went upstairs to change, got dinner at five
Went to Houston's and that's the first time I met Nas
Had Billboard with me and two months later he died
So this is what it sounds like when thugs cry


Markin' off days on the calendar I can't even sleep
Like a convict, waitin' on January 18th
When the Documentary dropped, it flooded the streets
My mix-tape buzz made me gold the first week
Double platinum in two months
Record labels getting' scared
Cause the kid from Compton selling like Sunny and Cher
Mix-Tape awards came around, glad I was there
To get my award, Mix-Tape Artist of the Year
Stepped on stage, and Justo let 'em know
You might as well crown him the new kind of the West Coast
A couple of months passed we ain't speak
My Sidekick went off ""Justo Rest in Peace""
I let everybody from Snoop to Busta know
A car crash just claimed the life of Justo
They say the good die young, if you know like I know
Live your life to the fullest one day we all gotta go

Give a moment of silence
If you're wearing a Fitted Cap take it off
If you driving, pull over to the side of the road
We lost an underground legend
Justo Faison
Mix-tape King
Rest in Peace",https://genius.com/The-game-justo-tribute-lyrics
Our Turn,The Street King,UnKnown,"The Game - My Turn
Aye yo, home, I'm number one mutherfucka (Fuck you.)
The Doctors Advocate, nigga. (Fuck you again.)
Just get used to me, man. You can't get rid of me, bitch
(Dj Skee WORLD PREMIER)
These niggas had a chance, now their shit is over
It's my turn, my turn, my turn, my turn
Don't be mad at me cause I kept it rollin'
It's my turn, my turn, my turn, my turn. (HAHA!)
24 loren hearts on that '06 Rover
It's my turn, my turn, my turn, my turn. (The Doctor's
Advocate)
Let the sun roof back and I keep on coastin?
It's my turn, my turn, my turn, my turn
I can hear niggas talking, whispering in the dark they're
Like dogs with no bark
When I pull over and park then guns starts to spark and the
Bullets find the mark
Niggas outlined in the chalk and I speak from the heart
When I say that I kill you, it's simple and plain
Don't say shit about Dre and don't mention The Game
This industry is fake and I can't understand how a grown ass
Man
Sent a bitch to the pen, how you snitched on stan; he's a
Bitch like his man
He'd of did you for a grand. Eminem called him stan
I'm going to say it again
If I had one more chance I would've break all of his ribs
With my bare fuckin' hands
I'm a gangsta with fire
You ain't, you a liar
You ain't got no pride, there's a snitch in the wire
Your fan base knows that you're gangsta is dying
I won't stop until that wanksta retires
I'm gone
These niggas had a chance, now their shit is over
It's my turn, my turn, my turn, my turn
Don't be mad at me cause I kept it rollin'
It's my turn, my turn, my turn, my turn
24 loren hearts on that '06 Rover
It's my turn, my turn, my turn, my turn
Let the sun roof back and I keep on coastin?
It's my turn, my turn, my turn, my turn
These rap niggas hate and they smile in my face
You rabbit niggas, man. The turtle ain't one to waste
And, the radio debate what the fuck they going to play
All the hot shit is my shit; they take what I say
Play scrabble with my words and put it on the front page
They go find a picture of 50 and Game
Say it's East vs. West; New York and L.A
Since I dont' button up, now I'm beefin' with Jay
Apologize in seconds
You niggas is reckless, you're not going to pay me to beef
With a legend
My pride I'd protect it, the streets I respect it
I'm not trying to replace Pac so accept
After 5 million records; the Dr.Dre lectures; and 3 world
Tours
West Coast Resurrected
My form to the group of help was rejected
I felt abandoned so I threw away my necklace
These niggas had a chance, now their shit is over
It's my turn, my turn, my turn, my turn
Don't be mad at me cause I kept it rollin'
It's my turn, my turn, my turn, my turn
24 lowen hearts on that '06 rover
It's my turn, my turn, my turn, my turn
Let the sun roof back and I keep on coastin'
It's my turn, my turn, my turn, my turn
After 20 magazines and a couple of awards
I can close the first chapter; put my plaques on the wall
To the top of the billboard
Who ever knew that I would sell more than Destiny Child and
U2?
Or do a song with Busta, go neck and neck with Usher?
Went gold in a week, I'm a bad mutherfucka
This Gangsta Disciple and vice lord shit
Brown pride, latin king
This is blood, this is crip
Hit the Impala Switch
I keep a clip for any nigga that said I fuck his bitch
Or changed cause I'm rich, saying Game used to strip
Niggas weren't saying shit until I came with a hit
Now you want to see me dead, blood stains in his whip
Take a father from his son, put my name in cement
After I'm gone they gonna sample my songs
You can bury my bones but my music lives on
These niggas had a chance, now their shit is over
It's my turn, my turn, my turn, my turn
Don't be mad at me cause I kept it rollin'
It's my turn, my turn, my turn, my turn
24 loren hearts on the '06 Rover
It's my turn, my turn, my turn, my turn
Let the sun roof back and I keep on coastin'
It's my turn, my turn, my turn, my turn
Aye yo, man, I don't really give a fuck about all that shit
Ya'll doing, that shit ain't making no noise. I'm saying
That shit is bullshit. Man, why you niggas trying fucking
Kill my mutherfucka career? Man, Shit! It ain't going to
Happen, nigga. Not as long as my mutherfuckin Bentley got 22
Inch lowen hearts on it, nigga. Shit! I'd be damn, nigga

Thank you Kiss, wow that's some gangsta shit
I'm going hard for New York until they clank my wrists, again
And since Wayne caught his locked up inside my pen
I've been watching from the side, I've been taking it in
Now I'm playing to win, I ain't playin' nigga
Play me I aim at your chin, then I'm straight to the pen
Do my time, come home and I'ma make it again
Glad to see Kim and Jim finally making amends
Niggas makin em ends, instead of hatin' on friends
We can all be Dame Dash and Jay on the bench
Throw my Yankee on, then I straighten the brim

Everybody mama in the hood talking My Son
Nope it's Mysonne, the hood's rap icon
New York's been dark and I'm back to turn the lights on
Back to when Tyson had us like 'Yo the fight's on'
The fresh champion hoodie with my spikes on
With my christ on, gettin' my dice on
Nigga it's the Bronx, you know I got my knife on
I rep the sewers and subways till I'm under that
Drop the beat, yo Flex let's bring the tunnel back
My city's shitty, sometimes my city's Diddy
Sometimes we cock hammers and get to the nitty gritty

Knockin' on your door with the goons and the fully
On some Larry Davis shit, shooting through the door
What you expect, it's the apple we rotten to the core

Somebody tell Joe that Mys ain't with the BS
We both from the BX, so it's still TS

Dear. Mr President,"Stop Snitchin, Stop Lyin",2005.0,"Aye yo Clue you got a pen?
Naw let me, let me use it holmes
I might make a mistake
Just gonna write me a letter to the President
Remember how Ice Cube did?
With the Death Certificate

Dear Mr. President
I wrote you a letter
Everybody askin' about Hot 97
If I squash the beef
Thats my business man
My nigga got shot
And he didn't take the wittness stand
I got kicked out of G-Unit
No hard feelin's
And the Aftermath
Is me and Dre still chillin'
Had a press conference
No more killin'
Guilty conscience
Donated a half a million
And Al Sharpton said hip-hop was over
The bigger the stunt
The more albums get sold
But 3 hollow tip's left my nigga in the cold
In front of the radio station
Bleedin' in the cold
Meanwhile the gun man
Runnin' for the backdoor
I ain't see his face
Ask Sha-Money he know
I ain't got beef with Banks, Buck, and Tony Yayo
But they still airing you out on mixtapes
So?

I got love for them
But I got hate for them
Should I let it slide?
Or sit outside and wait for them?
If I use the Glock 9 OR .38 for them
You gonna need a black suit and a wake for them
I got love for them
But I got hate for them
I don't know if I should lay 'em down
Or pray for 'em
Tell them nigga's if they ain't got cake for 'em
Then stop callin' Aftermath and Dre for 'em

Nigga's sayin' Game you don't need no clique
You got the hood ridin' with you
Man fuck 50 cent
Soon as I turn my back they talkin' shit about me
Who wanna see 2 more rappers deceased?
Okay 50 got a gun
Game got a gun
He shoot me
I shoot him
And the media have fun
My music's still alive
Yeah I'm fresh like ""uh""
New York and California carry our caskets through the slums
And any real nigga know if you gotta son
Shots pop off and you ain't got one you run
Homey thats real shit
Somethin' to deal with
I spent a 140 thousand and bulletproofed my wip
Cause nigga's hate to see you do some positive shit
First me and 50
T.I. and Lil' Flip
*Clue edited this part*
...Documentary dropped
And I can't take a piss without the hiphop cops

I got love for them
But I got hate for them
Should I let it slide?
Or sit outside and wait for them?
If I use the Glock 9 OR .38 for them
You gonna need a black suit and a wake for them
I got love for them
But I got hate for them
I don't know if I should lay 'em down
Or pray for 'em
Tell them nigga's if they ain't got cake for 'em
Then stop callin' Aftermath and Dre for 'em

This is just a letter to keep the piece
Just to inform you on what happened in D.C
Me and Zooloo was cool
We was just chillin
How I get sued for 285 million?
I was upstairs doing a show for him
He went to the bathroom and somebody broke his ribs
I swear before God
I don't know who did it
So they can take they lawsuit and wipe they ass with it
Thats just the facts
I ain't touched that cat
I'm a good nigga
You can ask dre and busta that
Niggas will do anything just for the cake
Like Bobby Brown got me watchin' every step I take
Give a hug to tight that bitch gonna yell rape
Thats why I ain't had no pussy since my change of heart date
Dear Mr. President when do this shit stop?
P.S. I ain't ready to die for hip hop

I got love for them
But I got hate for them
Should I let it slide?
Or sit outside and wait for them?
If I use the Glock 9 OR .38 for them
You gonna need a black suit and a wake for them
I got love for them
But I got hate for them
I don't know if I should lay 'em down
Or pray for 'em
Tell them nigga's if they ain't got cake for 'em

Yeah that's the name of my hometown
I'm goin down, in the town, where my name is all around
And niggas just be hatin and shit, that's a pity
But I ain't doin nuttin but claimin my city
See my lyrics are double or nothin provin to suckers I can throw 'em
Pass the natural 10 to 4 and six-eight before I go
Not really into freestylin, or tryin to promote violence
But they gotta know about the five-five-fo', so
And that's how I'm livin, I do as I please B

And everybody knows that you gotta be stompin

'til I found out, the streets get real dog

They musta thought that I was gon' play the bitch role
Cause I lived through fo' five six holes
But I ain't goin out like no faggot-ass clown
They found, they couldn't keep a gangsta nigga down
So here's the burner in your face motherfucker silly sucker
Ass clucker now you're duckin cause you can't stop a Y.G
Gangsta, cause I'm true to my game
You're lame, and thangs ain't gon' never be the same
Cause a nigga like the Game is takin over
I really don't think I should have to explain
Oh yeah I'm a dog but my name ain't Rover
And I'm the kinda nigga that's feelin no pain
Sometimes I have to wear a bulletproof vest
Because I got the C-P-T style written across my chest
A gangsta motherfucker never ceasin to impress
My name is young Game so you can fuck, the rest
I'm comin like this and I'm comin directly

So I called E-40, and tried to seize the violence
I got niggas on the island, for puttin' in stainless work
With vaseline on they palms, gettin' ready to ""
Bang Em Smurf

I here him screamin' in Compton, sound like my bitch cummin'
You wasn't never f*ckin' with G-Unit, quit frontin'

Lisa Leslie, a big woman
With a nine on the back, I'm gonna catch that bitch runnin'
Shove a .40 in his throat, now nigga spit somethin'
And get lost boy, go visit your big cousin
I got fish to fry, throw a line in the pacific
With cocaine on the hook, for this ""Luniz"" ass nigga
You a bitch, how you call your self the Ice Cream Man
When Master P took your name and your ice cream van
Made 500 million, that's your homey though
Took your man hood, gave your shit to Lil'Romeo
This nigga, 5 foot 2, talkin' that big shit
You got ""5 On It""? that money went to Chris Hicks
Tryin' to diss Too $hort for doin' his pimp shit
Nigga you been gitten f*cked, swallowin' big dicks
Pac knew he was a pussy, that's why he ran south
Signed to Rap-A-Lot, they never put his ass out
Hid behind Lil' J, all the sudden you thugged out
Ran back to the Bay, sleepin' on wannabe cuz couch
How you drop 5 albums, don't own one house
Or get the balls to call me, Banks, and Buck out
It's G-Unit bitch, let me show you what blood bout
When my blood pressure rise, I bring the bloods out
Put the barrell on his neck, blow his guts out
Now that's whats you call a ""Yukmouth""

I’m Home,Purp & Patron: The Hangover,2011.0,"Nigga, I'm from Compton
I don't need no mothafuckin' pass, no stamp, no nothin'
I don't need a passport to come through the mothafuckin' 'hood, nigga
I got a gun and a Bentley, what

Yeah, throw on my Levi's, throw on my hoodie
Tie up my Jordan's I'm ready for whatever
Hit the block like Bush, but I ain't no Saint
I'm just a 'hood nigga who taught himself how to paint
Pictures mothafucka
I'll show you how I went from rags to riches mothafucka
Welcome to the block life, niggas on the block like
The boy Hov can't tell me shit about the Roc life
I started with powder, turned into hard rock
Call it a cafe when the fiends here all block
We was just hustlin', listenin' to Scarface
Throwin' back tall cans, lookin' out for marked vans
I used to do it for my mother
Change the diapers on my sisters, clean the Pumas for my brothers, mothafucka
If that's not 'hood, send a shot to my dome
Wipe the wheels on the Bentley, nigga and tell the 'hood I'm comin' home

I'm home, you know what it is
Ready for the biz and I gotta do it big
I'm home, how many times are you alive if you ran these streets
So many times the streets kept calling me

I used to hit the block like a bat out of hell
With a blunt in my mouth and a pocket full of shells
Somebody shot my older brother, give a fuck about a jail
Give a fuck who outside, I don't care who tell
It was like that when we was just boys in the 'hood
Nigga, fuck what you saw on Boyz N the Hood
This is real, feel my pain, feel my gun, grab it
And when we pull up on this corner, let 'em have it
You wanna know how it feel to kill
Then grab my steal and peel at will
Put the ski mask on, hop in the backseat
Show 'em how to turn the block into a trackmeet
Your honor I'm guilty, I'm a felon and I pack heat
Fiends know my name cause Game let the crack speak
If that's not 'hood send a shot to my dome
Wipe the Lamborghini down, nigga and tell the 'hood I'm coming home


What you think mo' fucka?
I'll let seventeen go before you blink mo' fucka
I'm a poetry racist
You know it's me instantly just off a couple of phrases
I'm seventeen years and pussy just stopped a bullet
Pull these out of the wooly mammoth hoodie
I'm headed to the house, the land of ram
Runnin' in niggas spots, drop your hands and the grams
Drop everything you got from your pockets to your hands
When I was young we hit licks out of Astro vans
When I was young the Fox Hillmar was alit
Lick with Aquafina flow, Euprovina for pits
Pup, a child to a hog, a cat to a dog
I'm a lion to these frogs, who's supplyin' raw
I'm feeling like Martin Luther King, it seems
And everything I visualized was just a dream
I'm headed home nigga",https://genius.com/The-game-im-home-lyrics

On the fo'-wheel, pushin quarters like niggas doin dope deals
Fo' cut 50 like a verse and a half
I cut the brick and now we countin the math, we 'bout that birdplay
My crew's committed, you dudes gon' get it
Have a seat you through when I'm finished, my troopers is fitted
Got 'em posted out in Brooklyn, Hollis Queens to the Bridge
We in the studio the Figgaro done did it again
We got factors out in the ditch where they smackin a bitch
I got homies out in the Bronx where they bustin at cops
It ain't no game with the underground, came from the underground
Pushin a hundred thousand, we out the trunk, never browsin

And rest in peace to my boy Mac Dre, what'chu say nigga?
JT, another boss from the Bay
And rest in peace to my boy Mac Dre, motherfucker

Hey yo it seem to me like e'rybody got they own truth
Believe me I'm in them sheets like phonebooths
I play the game I was born to score
But I'm a lil' too cute for them corner stores
A little too, known, to stand on the block
And a lil' too eager to sit in the spot
Mami, I'm from the Eastside, yup yes that side
Heads fly if I open ya chest that wide
Gimme a bad vibe end up on ya backside
Or you can get your back and side splatted in back of ya ride
And I can make it happen, if I don't make it rappin
This lump of Satan I'm packin thrash 'em with a major passion
I slash ya face and fracture you flashin in the latest fashion
And have you dashin from Manhattan all the way to Aspen
Your shit is whack, heard your tape and had to take an aspirin
Step ya game up

Listen, before I get up in the mornin I ask the Lord for strength
Tryin to get my niggas out the hood, you know how the forces get
It's like the devil got a hold of my neck
And I'm gettin this change runnin 'round reppin my set
Momma used to look at me funny; she could tell her baby boy changed
Must be out there gettin some money
But it's a price for everything, you know how the game go
For them birds niggas'll cock back the calico
Now you introduced to the beef, what'chu gon' do now?
Bitch up, skid in your crib, or pull them tools out?
A lot of niggas is real, a lot of niggas is fake
A lot of niggas shake your hand and shake hands with Jake

Fuck what'chu heard, I startled your brain
I hit the spot like a {?} in ballers and jeans
On some eighty-eight shit, more ""Raw"" than Kane
It's not my fault she looked at me - you better talk to your dame
That's just, part of the game and you got served
Who got nerve cause Lethal hard like 2Pac words
And, why y'all Chucks always actin like tough guys
You must be trippin or you slippin on mudslides
And in the hood you see it's different from one time
What's your bloodline, play the strip to the sunshine
And I don't even know why I'm wastin my breath
I oughta be like Makaveli and be fakin my death
I keep that good shit it's tastin so fresh
And all y'all sloppy Joe niggas yo y'all makin a mess

When we ride
Three killas on the rise
Come through screamin' homicide when we ride
Nigga, Westside

Yo, I caught him at the corner liquor store, ran him for his jewels
Told him ""give me everything you got, hat to the shoes""
You done show me what it is, now show me what it do
I done jacked a gang of bitch ass niggas like you
My profile suspect I'm wanted for murder
Investigated by the feds on old shit I ain't heard of
In '94 they say ya boy was involved in a car jack
That's when my phone start trippin', I'm knowin' my shit tapped
Tryna tell me how I'm livin' like they BET
Sometimes I feel like there's a camera in my TV screen
I am the best, ever since my moms left
I ain't holdin' my breath, I'm prosecuted to death
It's Eastwood, I'm as deadly as turpentine
Spittin' venomous rhymes with more heart then Valentine's
When we ride


Life is what you make it sometimes I see blatant
Visions of Satan, I been smokin' hell of them marijuana vapors
With dreams of gettin' paper on felonious capers
Run a car for neighbors, bangin' The Best of Anita Baker
Now is that sacred? When niggas spend money on Jacob's
And it's that same shit that get blood spilled on the pavement
I'm patiently waitin', for God to open heaven' gates and
I'll take a knife in my heart before I murder my neighbor
And for that I'm hated, 'cause most of they rhymin' is basic
Dropped one album and left the whole world stuck in amazement
Started with Rakim, found him in my mom's basement
One demo tape and I'm on Em and Dr. Dre shit


The 'hood got me feelin' like my back against the wall but I been here before
Let me fly or give me death, while I'm in here for dough
My pops used to hustle the corner in Lotto kicks
Attempt to try 'em on, didn't like that fit
Went after a record deal, shit I got that spit
Besides niggas ain't flyer than Tech at this shit
I'm a natural nigga, so it's only right to boss up
After these figures, so classical nigga
Had to document the avenue, study the set
Back to the OG's, create a new avenue nigga
So we could ride, rims spinnin' off the chrome
Check the rearview, Wave spittin' off the dome

El Presidente,Untold Story,UnKnown,"Death before dishonor, ride with weap' up
Cause niggas tryin' to dent my armor
Cold streets, Telly Mac keep the guns on 'em
They wanna know how that nigga from California
Could run up on ya on any corner
Put somethin' on ya
How I stuff bricks in the 6, with no crack aroma
Dawg, I'm just livin' for the moment
I'm from Compton homey, but I'm like a center for Milwaukee
Cause I plays for the bucks and I keep the 40 on me
Gotta keep the chrome-y, gotta keep my back to the wall
Wait for Q to rock me up, like cavi dawg
Speakin' of lle', I put 8 in, 10 jump back hard
And watch my money come back like Jordan in charge
I'm like the black Yankees, they don't want me around no more
Cause I hold the record for the most fiends roamin' the boulevard
And when I'm on the boulevard, catch me behind the wheel
Of that new Escalade with the Foreman grill

Steppin' out of Chevies with heat that's heavy, that's president
Bullets flyin' for them dead guys, that's president
Lead meltin' inside your wig, that's president
20's 50's and 100's burnin', it's all president
Steppin' out of Chevies with heat that's heavy, that's president
Bullets flyin' for them dead guys, that's president
Lead meltin' inside your wig, that's president
20's 50's and 100's burnin', it's all president

Aiyyo, I do this shit from Compton to the Mac block
High-tech collaborations with the Gamblaz and Black Sox
Drillin' 'em, killin 'em, if we ain't feelin' 'em nigga
If sticky Fingaz need some music, straight stealin' it nigga
Shinin' in big trucks, big will in it nigga
We climbin' to the top and we sealin' it nigga
So back the f*** up, my niggas act the f*** up
So keep yourself in line or you could get smacked the f*** up
Jacked the f*** up, beat up bad and clapped the f*** up
Wrapped up in white sheets and threw in a white truck
Over presidents, now you willin' to give your life up?
Put your kids on the line and give your wife up?
Over presidents, they got you soulless
So take this bomb and hold this, while we control this
For the streets, we comin' with heat that's stolen
And we hustle universal, for that paper that we foldin'
Roll in 600's, Beamers and 'llacs
We a team of cats with the Benz and gats
That fiend for jacks but only when the green's attached
We fiend for jacks but only when the green's attached


It's Telly and young game the hustler, ho juggler, coke smuggler
No matter what the hustle, dough doublin'
Ya or the rock, give me a day and a spot
And I bet I'll come back with 10K in the drop
I'll stay in the spot, wearin' a crop and coppin' ounces
Telly Mac and Game the hustler, we rock the house
And plus we the reason that the blocks is out
So my words to the wise is just watch your mouth
And you don't want it when the stainless out
What the game about, the bullets is in, your brains is out
All over Frisco and Compton dawg, we ruthless
And the truth is y'all niggas can't stop us dawg
So why the f*** you wanna knock us off?
Like we some high-powered cowards
And y'all really the niggas that's soft
Still across the train tracks, we turn 'caine crack

Straight out the brick house to a brick house
Money flowin' like it's Cristal
Shine on it swiss styles, I'm hood as Kid Styles
My Clair Bomber jacket perfect for the pit stop, it is now
You boys don't want none, release on the blood Glock
They here by, they go numb
Goin' plan no. 1 with the gang no. 2
Start track no. 3 back to ypee MV

Ten gangstas outside, meeting gangstas in the building
One nigga can't stop this motherfuckin' killin'
Hell on earth the repercussion, if blood is spilt on my children
Cowboys and Indians, motherfuck the pilgrims
Infiltrate my squad near every cat buildin'

Don't make a nigga pull Glocks and bust shots
Spin that black ghost around the block

Give a bitch chills and thrills for days

With the finger tag backs, you ain't jackin' that
Yo Game, I'm laughin' at these coppers turned shoters, imagine that
You're mad a fuckin' life happen at
You's the only one there, I swear
Stuck the blood clut cryin'
I'm in Belize with Game when these shots fired in this silence
Y'all motherfuckaz singin'
I've see the paperwork, you a fuckin' pigeon, no kidding

Nigga blood got Ferrari's and Lambo's parked outside the drug spot
Survived five shots, you know that
When bitch niggas died, they cried
Cause they had to pay for that
Payers took it, where the blow at?
I just won a hundred racks on blackjack and you know I'm 'bout to blow that
They don't make real niggas where you from
Sick 45, I'm 'bout to finger fuck the trigga till them hollows come
Talk shit? Swallow one
You fuckin' move me
I disrespect niggas like in old Italian movies
I'm sayin', I live, you ready
I come in the restaurant with my shirt off and spit in your fuckin' spaghetti sauce
Boss, my pocket's fatter than my nigga Ross
Wipe this spilled Patron off my mouth with my Louis glove

Bust your cerebellum, skateboard go and tell 'em

Do you see what I see, can you hear what I hear
All these stu-di-o gangsters, year after year
With these gimiicks I can't take it they ain't real so they fakin it
How did they make it in this game for so long
I know what's right from what's wrong, I know what's soft from what's hard
I know a federal case, from a publicity charge
Man I FOUGHT tooth and NAIL to keep them PUNKS out of JAIL
But hoes wanna go to COURT 'til I pay them for they NAILS
Who you tryin to be? Man it couldn't be me
My man spent guap and bought me my Continental T
You spent your advance on your Continental T
I know you sick when you clean your RIMS you still see a Bee
And we see you a LIAR, tryin to DENY HER
Jackie O. proved you FAR from a FIGHTER

The hot iron's what them gangsters put into you
'Til you laid up and your gangster's on critical
SHOTS get into you bleedin like my men-e-straul
And if I don't like you then I will pretend to
It's the ones that befriend you that TURN up against you
In the court of law and drop a DIME like Sprint do
Supposed to be tough huh? 'Til them boys touch ya
Chump muh'fuckers start confessin like Usher
I cut you off cause I knew I couldn't trust ya
Lame ass bustas, backwards-ass hustlers
You fake phony, you always was lil' homey
Big lil' son bab' boy like Jody
I put you under my wing, bought you your first Roley
Nigga I helped raised you, why would I play you?

How they knife game ILL and they gun go CLAP
Them niggas rats, they run and they trap
'Til they run in a trap, and there's no comin back
It be the SAME ones talkin 'bout the guns they sparkin
The dogs never bite but do a whole lotta barkin
A whole lotta growlin 'til the wolves start howlin
They pitbull shit, man them niggas straight cowards
Got 'em scared to death, pissin in they trousers
Always was a bitch that's why I sent his ass flowers
Thanks to the Queen he can share 'em with his team
You can run top speed BUT YOU CAN'T DODGE THE BEAM
Got a CLEAN 16 and my spit game mean
Don't be fooled and deceived, everything ain't what it seems

Balls faster than roger Clemens nigga you're too big for your britches
Two gold albums and I'll make you a hitter
Might make you a little richer but don't forget the big picture
All of those make you a fag but money like Little Richard
Take your faggot ass picture put it next to Gulliany
Run you for your roc-a-wear fit and beat you with the Tommy
Drag your ass down to Alby Square
Call Beans, Jay, Freeway, Biggs, Dame I'll be there
Compton behind me ask Nas queens is with me
You ain't never sold crack in your life I'm takin your fiends with me
My guns smoke like Robert Downey
Two shots and a pound he got a room in Kings County
And you might live or sit in a box
Depending on how long it NYPD to respond to the shot

See what the problem is too much east coast dick lickin
And everybody tryin to do their best 2pac rendition
Listen they wonder how I live with 5 shots
Niggas is hard to kill on my block
When you was in the streets comin of age
I was in the streets pumpin the gauge
While you was rappin I was makin it happen
On the block with a k
While you was with the roc on the stage
I had rocks on the stage
On headliner for the front page we know that you front
You be on sunset doin what? Gettin your punk ass stunt
You gon respect us or that fo' rippin through the vests
And you know who you are deaf nigga'll get the message

Fuck around and be a B-I-T-C-H sleek
Cuz all that yappin dude will get guns clappin dude
And stop Memphis from rappin dude, huh

It took me a little while but I am now understandin
Jay fucked up in the first round when he picked olo with candy
Did olo in the second, nigga take it from me
The Roc get knocked off the bounce till you picked up beans
Add freeway to the team but move the ugly bitch
Trade the Marcy reject for Cam'ron and Lil' Chris
Now the squad 5 is live 6 man is Neef
Fans in the stand yellin out fuck Memphis Bleek
You want beef I have your body parts all over New York
Leg in jersey arm in Brooklyn head buried in central park
You can't even borrow from New York no more like john Storch
And I ain't talkin to him I'm talkin to Malik
And I got a pine box for a nigga like you
Streets is talkin how many real niggas like you

Hit you with mixtapes 'til your fuckin' chest cave in

And Rihanna gon' be hoppin' out of birthday cakes
I'm a trendin' topic, tell these lil' niggas stop it
Nigga, I'm clockin', let your G Shock clock it
Just got a Mazi, took it to the shop, dropped it
Slide through the 'hood, 3 ball, side pocket
With my side chick and the hair flip
Like the old Sidekick, the world bumpin' my shit

Oh, didn't think I would make it up here, right

Watch how I do it to ya
I'm the king, started my own gang, shit. I'm like Larry Hoover to ya

Hottest mixtape since Wayne dropped No Ceilings

Big blunt smokin', flossin' in my interviews
Two bad bitches naked in my livin' room
Big black Benz's, both of 'em 62's
Bottles on ice, livin' life like s'posed to do
Nigga, stop hatin', start congratulatin'
We throwin' paper in the air like we graduated
They say money talk, well check a nigga conversation
Talk so much, Game made a nigga occupation

Charlie O, drop that hot shit

Motherfucker it's the Game, mister tint the windows wit'cha brain
Since a young'n up and comin, all I did was cop 'caine
They try and change the Game, nigga I still cop 'caine
I ain't moved out the hood, still stay where the cops came
Bitches tryin to throw salt in my name, barbers tryin to part my game
Niggas tryin to chalk my frame
But I walk on a thin line without scuffin my Chucks
Bad Boyyyyy, and I fuck with Puff
So bring the guns if you want nigga; I'm real good with the Glock
When I fuck Lil' Kim guess I'm feelin like 'Pac
Niggas wanna wrestle The Game, guess they feel like The Rock
""It doesn't matter,"" 745 up and down your block
Hop out with a Nextel, niggas feel like they shot
It's different in my hood, only time we take shots
Is when the Dodgers did good, my niggas live on the block

This is for the gangster, in me
This is for the gangster, in you - all my gangsters pour the brew
This is for the gangster, in me
This is for the gangster, in you - all my gangsters red and blue

I'm worldwide with this gangsta lean, my life's no dream
I got a crew in Jamaica, Queens
Lake Charles up to New Orleans in D.C. I sip
My thugs get crunk off Lil' Flip
State to state many shows I rip, I'm the boss of the Bay
Like Clint Eastwood, make my day
Fine bitches look like Lisa Raye, plot on gettin paid
In the end, all they get is played
Maybe a nut, no Ice Capade
Real dudes is shiesty, I only give jewels to wifey
And I don't give a fuck if you really don't like me
It's in my blood to thug, get ill and hyphy
One of the best I might be, it really don't matter
When I bust, sucker MC's scatter, gettin out of my way
I bust bad bitches night and day
I make classics like Dr. Dre, closed casket from rhymes I say


... Gon' move in on your rock, say fuck the crisis
And ride with the West we got lower coat prices
You know me the king of L.A., New York
Drivin through Brooklyn in a fo', same color as water
You want X? I can cover the order
Ninety-fo' been hustlin now watch the shit elevate like Vince Carter
Not the rap martyr, or the second rap Carter
Compton's own, I'm home, not the best I just rap harder
Heir to the throne, nobody rep Compton like me
Street spinning like waves on that Continental T
My grandmoms woulda been proud of me, look at your grandson now
Until my demise, Black Mafia ties
So it's hard to let the larcent die, my {?} treys
A killer changin the game like them Marcy guys
And I been compared to Shyne like Shyne was compared to Biggie

Cold streets, Telly Mac keep the guns on 'em
They wanna know how that nigga from California
Could run up on ya on any corner
Put somethin' on ya
How I stuff bricks in the 6 with no crack aroma
Dawg, I'm just livin' for the moment
I'm from Compton homey, but I'm like a center for Milwaukee
'Cause I play for the Bucks and I keep the 40 on me
Gotta keep the chrome-y, gotta keep my back to the wall
Wait for Q to rock me up, like cavi dawg
Speakin of lle', I put 8 in, 10 jump back hard
And watch my money come back like Jordan in charge
I'm like the black Yankees, they don't want me around no more
'Cause I hold the record for the most fiends roamin' the boulevard
And when I'm on the boulevard, catch me behind the wheel
Of that new Escalade with the Foreman grill
Steppin' out of Chevies with heat that's heavy, that's president
Bullets flyin' for them dead guys, that's president
Lead meltin' inside your wig, that's president
20's 50's and 100's burnin', it's all president

No matter what the hustle, dough doublin'
Yale or the rock, give me a day and a spot
And I bet, I'll come back with 10K in the drop
I'll stay in the spot, wearin' a crop and coppin' ounces
Telly Mac and Game the hustler, we rock the house
And plus we the reason that the blocks is out
So my words to the wise is just watch your mouth
And you don't want it when the stainless out
What the game about, the bullets is in, your brains is out
All over Frisco and Compton dawg, we ruthless
And the truth is y'all niggas can't stop us dawg
So why the fuck you wanna knock us off
Like we some high-powered cowards
And y'all really the niggas that's soft
Still across the train tracks, we turn 'caine crack
It's Telly Mac and Game the hustler, you can't change that

Bullets flyin' for them dead guys, that's president

Sheek'll throw the fiend on a nigga guarantee he won't walk up out it

But the muzzle that I use'll make this motherfucker updated
Puh, nigga please; if a nigga had your son
And had him lookin down the gun you wouldn't need to squeeze
Uh uh I don't know, don't wanna hear
About the money that you had, or what you did a long time ago
Yo yo the hood is mine; I don't gotta sell a lot
I just live off more points than the porcupines
Fuh-fuh feel me cousin?
Sheek been a problem before this D-Block shit started buzzin
Some'll say no he wasn't, he turned sick

If I don't catch you, I'mma catch James Cruz or Chris Lighty

Now I'm on Aftermath we supply them hits
Now everybody love Dre
And they riding dick
Cause Eminem getting money
Fifty getting money
Streets is talking watch the Game after this summer
I ain't talking 'bout the NFL
I'm talking 'bout me and Big Fase 100 in them twin SL's
Cause I'm a gangbanger nigga
So try your luck
And have desert eagle slugs whizzin by your truck
Kanye don't lie
I'm high as fuck
That's the purple haze
Family Matters but I been smoking since the Eurkel days
I can't rember if I was five or ten
When my Uncle Greg got locked
Did a five to ten
Got out and got stabbed to death
I though I never understand how a nigga could just kill a man
Now you see me walking out the cemetery like thriller man
And I ain't MJ
But when the game on the line
Gotta take them shots like MJ
And that ain't no bullshit when the Mac-10 spray
Give 'em fifty in the garden
Kill you by myself and I don't need no Pippen when I'm ballin'
Got niggas in the Nickerson Gardens
That will fill you up with holes like G-Unit and Fifty in the Garden

Here is something they can't understand
They wanna know where Dre found him man
Somewhere running 'round Cali with the pound in hand
And I can't for my shit to hit the fan
Here is something they don't understand

Now he got a deal nobody can stop him man
And it's gonna take more than five shots to drop him damn

Don't leave the house with out the steel in hand

Hogtie ya bitch
By them fake Manolo's
Fuck her brains out if you run to the jakes or popo's
Black Wallstreet nigga
I came for dolo
Remember when my brother used to bang K-Solo
I was twelve years old with cocaine in polos
And niggas knew who I was
Furthered mixtapes with whoo kid
All of a sudden dude got buzz
Is he from Compton?
Is he from Queens?
Is he from Yonkers?
Is he on Aftermath?
Can he write me a 16?
Is that Eazy E's son?
Is he a blood or a crip
My air force ones the same color as bricks
Last week I bought my mother a gift
That 2004 McClaren the same color as piss
Got a nine the same color as this
I'm a ghetto boy
I just rap a lot like J. Prince


Now that's what I'm talkin' 'bout
This goes out to all my gangsta niggas across the muthafuckin' globe
Holla at ya boy Chuck Taylor
I got to let em know
That's wassup
And you know I got to holla at my nigga K-Dog

Drive in '95 tryna run away from Satan
Used to dribble rock as a kid like Jason
When my mother was at church every Sunday like Mason
Prayin' for her baby boy, sittin' in a Lazy Boy
Like ""I'ma beat the shit out this crazy boy""
That was '97, I was in high school
Nobody told me my grandmother would die soon
I mean, Jesus Christ knew
Why he ain't pull me on my pants, let me tell me big momma was fightin' cancer
Four months passed, Jesus never answered
So I looked at gangbangin' like ""uh, I'ma chance it""
Red rag in my pocket, Cedar Block on my neck
For the last seven years I've been a prophet of death
And even though I got shot in the chest
I persevered, now Jimmy Iovine' name on the bottom of my checks
So it's G-Unit West

I'll never forget when my brother died, forget when my cousin died
Forget 9/11 when all of them mothers died
So fuck Sadam, Bin Laden and them other guys
Told my baby sister ""pray when your brother fly""
And any other nigga tryna make my mother cry
You will get a grave for that shit Joe Budden tried
You seen High Top in Colors, right?
We nothing alike, 'cause me, I take motherfuckas lives

In my Honda Accord-a, ridin' with sinora
Boy fuck interns, boy let the chronic burn
That's they car but I come through in the Cutlass with AR
And I might come through with Bango
He said, ""Baby girl, you're so damn fine though.""
Don't even mind though
I just got five bricks from my homie Mando

Frasco, best dressed though
I got a Polo on my vest doe
You know I represent the West doe
You know I'm turnt
Ask my mama, she gon' say, ""That boy burnt!""
Yeah, ask my grand mama, she gon' say, ""God bless his soul in his pajamas.""
But my pajamas is Polo, catch me on the South Beach, or down in SoHo
I told y'all about 60 minutes ago boy still do the trickin'
I'll be all down in Beverly Hills and then when I'm hungry
I go to Roscoe's, Finga Licking
Chicken, KFC, C-P-T, N-A-T-E D-O double G, then Snoop in the Coupe
Y'all wanna fuck with me
'Cause I come through with the homie Kendrick, YG
Can't forget Nipsey, can't forget Glasses, can't forget Steam
Everybody on they asses
Nobody even want it 'cause the West Coast aftermath
That stands for acid
Jay just stopped to Compton, YG said it's Bompton
I think I'm kinda confused, no matter how you do it, dawg, everybody lose
Power 106 doe, you know I'm goin' rich road

Take the Patron and mix it with Juice
I'm all in my zone I'm feeling real loose
The bigger the Belvy the bigger the Goose
I snatch up a broad and hop in the coupe
In Compton where I'm found at
That's where I stunt and clown at
That's where I where I wear my crown at
Tie my red rag around that
I'm riding in Ferraris
I'm draped up in Bulgari
Used to run around the A with Puff how that nigga used to stunt just scarred me
Now you can just black card me
Down Crenshaw Boulevard me
Think a nigga went soft cause I stopped moving raw
Somebody better get a fucking


That's my Patron that's my bitch
See I be on some fly shit
Now I can fit my projects inside my fucking closet
Daffy Duck and uncle Screw
That's what we stuffing in them boots
Put them bitches on the track, sell them hoes to Interscope
Sell them hoes to Def Jam, I'm known for moving work
Ask around, I've been selling birds since Gucci said ""BURR""
I'm a cold mutha Flocka
Red Diamonds in my watch huh
That nigga got a hot one
Take a trip to the A and cop one
That Lambo came with shotguns
You prob'ly never shot one
That Bent come with Alicia
You prob'ly never chopped none
Them bullets I done caught some
Them bottles I done popped some
So order that Cîroc son
Can't wait 'til twelve'o'clock come


If you ain't tryna leave the club leaking on crutches
Than when you see a real nigga don't say nothing
Bust em (x9)
This for all the niggas in the trap playing round the oven
If you can't get em off let a real nigga touch em

I’m a Mobsta,Untold Story: Volume II,2005," + (The Game)
Yeah! What is it? It's Young Menace, and the Game
(Hahaha, yeah) Stackin chips, G-Unit (Chuck Taylor)
Doublin down on who? (Compton's young guns)
Sacramenton's finest (Who fuckin with me?)
From Sac-Town to Compton, you dig?

Yo, yo, now ain't no tellin what the Game'll do, listen dawg
I blow the guts out the dutch and do the same to you
And just to get shit crackin, I drop the toaster
Grab the Louis go Sammy Sosa
And you ain't gotta know me to know that, I hop out a new pink Rolls
With the fifty-two Pete Rose throwback
Haze in my eyes, listen to Bobby Womack
On the same corner where Eazy-E sold coke at
And dawg I'mma test your education
What do I mean when I say I move more birds than migration?
I'm the nigga that'll smoke the purple, get high as a kite
Down half the Goose then choke your workers
Don't make me put two in your shirt, dawg I put in the work
Then move bags like Doony & Bert
And stuff work in the GMC, cause on my block
I'm the King of Rock like Run-D.M.C., nigga

I'm a mobster, with a mac-11 chopper
That'll pop ya and put one through ya motherfuckin collar
I'm a mobster, Robin Hood's like Kevin Costner
If ya fuck with my dollars I'll make you swallow my daughters
I'm a mobster, I keep a bitch by my waist
Just in case I gotta draw down to get this big face
I'm a mobster, uh-huh, yeh-yeah
I'm a mobster, uh-huh, yeh-yeah

Shhhhh.. I got a lot to say
Dawg I gotta get paid that's why I rock the lle'
And chop the lle' to push bricks through your block a day
I'll bring terror to your squad and make you rock away
Don't depend on tomorrow you can get shot today
I'll spit acid on your turf and watch your block decay
Dawg I spit on your grave and fertilize you too
I hit 'em hard with 16 bars, flames and fumes
Somebody needs to push your infant rap back in the womb
Go 'head and keep talkin that shit and get your life consumed
I put a hole in your chest dawg the size of the moon
Yeah you musta been talkin, how'd you get out that soon?
(You fuckin snitch!) I got a chop that'll touch yo' head like Vidal Sassoon
You don't wanna see my platoon, I got gorillas and baboons
That won't hesitate, they gon' do what they have to
When there's beef on the streets it's on for life like tattoos


It don't matter what season, it don't matter not a day
I move traffic through the city, plus I keep the right of way
I'm on point like Bibby, I'm the leader of the team mayne
Got the whole city amped just like a Lakers versus Kings game
Everybody's fired up, I drop major packages
I'm never doin bids because my game is so immaculate
A bitch try to snitch, ""I Can't Deny It"" like Fabolous
Before the evidence gatherin, someone's in an ambulance
Now that'll learn you to keep your big mouth shut
Those with big mouths I got the perfect size nuts
Yeah I do my dirt, but I wash my hands thoroughly
Handle my business first so I can celebrate early
It's business before pleasure my business brings me pleasure
It feels good to be able to shine, in any type of weather
That's why I do what I gotta do so my money's lookin tight

Ya Newport dipped

Walk with me through the ghost town
Compton, Cali-forn-ia
Where it goes down
A bunch of Pookies
A bunch of Richard Pryor's
Game give em' the holy ghost
Without no choir
He don't serve em' less he pat em' for wires
He knows to many niggas with priors
Get em' wet like 2 fingers

If it dry up
Back to the Maytag with fire
If he dyin'

He get rock from David

So open your ghetto bible
Fiends in the cemetery lookin for thriller
Just call me the ghetto Micheal
I got gallons
But we don't discuss prices
Red top
Blue top
Pink ones for different clients
You ever seen heron fiends
In the field chargin the Game
Like Naytron Means
On the hood of a cop car
Quick to say I'm clean
Freaks come out at night
But ain't shit on daytime fiends
Know mean
I stretch on the block like Yao Ming
Doc, I got a problem
I can't turn down fiends


I'm a drug dealer
What the fuck could I say
I can't stop selling PCP
Out the CLK
If it's a drought
I be okay
Run the rock in Buffalo
I be OJ
It ain't no limit
Thats why the fiends on me mane
One hit'll make you feel like you could lift an army tank
You know me
The kid who sold yayo by the bank
Now I'm getting off 50's like Yayo and Banks
And it's back to the hood again
Red riding hood again
Hopping over project fences with the goods again
Running through alleys
Scuffing my Air Forces
Choppin karats
While sending my demo in to The Source
Standin at news stands
Drug dealing
Reading XXL
Desert Eagle under the XXL
But now it's back to the drive-bys
And air in the rifle
Cause niggas singing in the hood like American Idol",https://genius.com/The-game-sherm-stick-magic-stick-2-lyrics

Lovebirds,Purp & Patron: The Hangover,2011.0,"I am one with the moon, the 54th platoon
Red beam coming soon, straight outta the blue lagoon
Only seat that blows in the winter, the placenta
The ganja, the marijuana, gives me lifted like the steam, the steaming saunas
So I ponder, mickie dees or benihanas
The other day I've seen my mama, dipping in mi ganja
I said what are you doing?, She blamed Obama
Presidential Rolexes, presidential sweets all night swisher
It's kinda like a picture with no paint, blank
Like the mind of a dead man
And bitches are sweating me like Allen Iverson's headband
Drip after drip, I dropped the phantoms hot, not Mariah
But I carry fire, my cannon is hot
As a California summer on no ac on a Hummer
This is game, spitting flames with Andre 3000 numbers

Love birds, love birds me and my rose phantom are
Love birds, love birds, me and my marijuana are
Love birds, love birds, me and the palm trees are love birds
Love birds, love birds, me and the Cadillac are
Love birds, love birds, me and the ATL are
Love birds, love birds, me and my microphone are love birds

I introduce the AT alien to your smelling it
Chronic bushes that are larger than African elephants
Relevant is my kush yours is not
So stop pretending it's from a Californian spot
I am so high, it would take Dwight Howard to snatch me out of the sky
I am flying and your career dying
I should get my best khaki suit out of the closet and put the iron to it
Reminiscing back when I didn't have no khaki suit to cruise on Levi's and Patrick Ewing's
Kept it moving, now I ball like Patrick Ewing
Junior, ask Dre before he met me I was sicker than a tumor
And I had a Glock that threw Bullets like boomer
Had niggas running faster they're running backs
On an Oklahoma Sooners, no sooner I said it
I was sweated by my baby mama, the first one, drama

Love birds, love birds, me and my marijuana are

Love birds, love birds, me and the Cadillac are

Skip through The Blueprint one bang this what's mentioned
Bleek you're one hit away but he didn't know The Game was pitchin
Balls faster than Roger Clemens nigga you're too big for your bitches
Two gold albums and I'll make you a hitter
Might make you a little richer but don't forget the big picture
All of those make you a fag but money like Little Richard
Take your faggot ass picture put it next to Giuliani
Run you for your roc-a-wear fit and beat you with the Tommy
Drag your ass down to Alby Square
Call Beans, Jay, Freeway, Biggs, Dame I'll be there
Compton behind me ask Nas queens is with me
You ain't never sold crack in your life I'm takin your fiends with me
My guns smoke like Robert Downey
Two shots and a pound he got a room in Kings County
And you might live or sit in a box
Depending on how long it NYPD to respond to the shot

Memph Bleek...Memph Bleek...Memph Bleek

See what the problem is too much east coast dick lickin'
And everybody tryin to do their best 2Pac rendition
Listen they wonder how I live with five shots
Niggas is hard to kill on my block
When you was in the streets comin of age
I was in the streets pumpin the gauge
While you was rappin I was makin it happen
On the block with a k
While you was with the Roc on the stage
I had rocks on the stage
On headliner for the front page we know that you front
You be on sunset doin what? Gettin your punk ass stunt
You gon respect us or that fo' rippin through the vests
And you know who you are deaf nigga'll get the message
Malik or M-E-M-P-H Bleek
Fuck around and be a B-I-T-C-H sleek

Did olo in the second, nigga take it from me
The Roc get knocked off the bounce till you picked up beans
Add freeway to the team but move the ugly bitch
Trade the Marcy reject for Cam'ron and Lil' Chris
Now the squad 5 is live 6 man is Neef
Fans in the stand yellin out fuck Memphis Bleek
You want beef I have your body parts all over New York
Leg in jersey arm in Brooklyn head buried in central park
You can't even ball for New York no more like John Starks
And I ain't talkin to him I'm talkin to Malik

Parked on the block with the nose up, get ready for the face off
Nicholas Cage ain't got shit on a nigga with a fuckin' grenade
One man army, only two things in the world can call me
West pussy and that bomb ass chronic
I never back down, never back down
Never back down, now let the bone thugs back


Now we them niggas in them black dickies and steel toe boots
Stomp on that nigga that got a pistol but he still gon' shoot
Cause he a hoe, like half to these niggas is rappin'
I'm a let you know, these niggas is actin' and puttin' on a fancy show
We done checked these niggas, met these niggas man I don't respect these niggas
I'm a real mother fucking T-H-U-G, original hate to be a critic
But yo shit I ain't feeling, no, you niggas is elementary
I got history, lyrically you can't see me, physically ill bring your misery, seriously
You niggas ain't been hearing me, but listen to these other niggas hits
You hear my twist they blew my shit, but its all good, cos we keep it all hood
And when we see niggas get rolled dog like a hog should
Just lemme put the mother fuckin' money on the wood
Bitch niggas would be gone if they could, but I'm a shut em down
I'm a shut 'em down, I'm a shut em down, bone niggas known not to fuck around!

If you lookin'!

I got my hand on my balls, grippin in the raws
Hood star, shit could be my boulevard, you know I'm in the streets
I ain't hard to reach, on some cool shit and some beef shit nigga I'm in the
Streets, this ain't my only occupation hittin' avenues, chasin' paper always
And I know how to get It, and pissy hallways, in the raw way
You can get it how you live, nigga step the wrong way
I let it bang b-bang bang, I'm the street for real
And I love it but you know how the game play got me ready to kill
Somebody, but its all good, wit' these shows at my streets nigga all good
Gotta be stacking my paper like that's all I know, these niggas is playin'
I gotta get it like lock and load, winter through summer, summer back through to winter

Cellphone ft. Dubb,UnKnown,UnKnown,"I remember days on Crenshaw, take a nigga Beamer
Hit the hood, take his rims off
Then hit that block, let him hear that Pac
That shit don't stop
Soo woo, new coupe, through the west side
New Benz, top down, new rims, new bitch throwin' up P's, whoo whoop

Compton niggas ain't never gon' be the same
It's in my blood, you see my veins
You see my tats, you feel my pain
You in my hood? You from a gang
You got 2 seconds to answer where you from, or you gon' see your brains
Now that you slumped I see your change

Nigga we got canals, shelves, niggas that tried, niggas that died
Niggas that fell well, off in their jail cell
Shit, we got niggas with full clips
That dip through you set and disappear like ""Hell, Well""
No bail like the peace price
Get caught up in the middle of the street at the light, you fuckin' bean pie
Middle of your forehead nigga, that's where your beam lie
(You be ok) Cause I ain't seen God

Niggas sellin' crack, Dre sellin' headphones
2Pac in heaven, bumpin' Biggie ""Dead Wrong""
Cherry red Impala, Bible had rebon
I just killed a nigga on my cellphone
Puff sellin' vodka, weed got my head gone
G-Man in heaven, name on that headstone
LJ in prison, and my nigga Legs gone
I just killed a nigga on my cellphone
Stop that

Playin' chronic, blazin' chronic with the windows tinted
Cause hoes that don't cut the checks, the ones in yo' business
Rappers sendin' death threats but still ain't sent no killers
You take a stretch  squeeze myself, can't depend on niggas
Shit on niggas check the urinal and you'll see
That I be droppin' jewels and you should take 'em like a jewel thief
Wolves teeth is what I use to eat my fuckin' pray up with
Used to make the yayo flip now Game told me to lay your hits
Teamed up, toured the US just to let the name ring
Goin' home to fuck shit up, I did the King James thing
Steak and lobster with the gentleman, sit with a gangster posture
Blowin' all these bands fans, screamin' like it's Frank Sinatra
Made it out the South Bay village homies hate I prosper
But I don't owe you niggas shit, I'm supposed to thank my mama
Only chase for commas, got 'em in now raise the Llama
Hotter than a blazin' comet, fuckin' south central moth


The fuck?
Oh shit
Chuck!... Chuck!
What!?
This motherfucker's recording down she's sucking the wrong dick nigga
You bullshit
Nigga bring your mother fuckin phone, I gotta get this shit on the grim nigga, gotta get my followers up, I'm gonna blow the internet up with this mother fucker
That bitch on WorldStar nigga
Damn
Push the door open nigga, watch out
Oh the nigga bustin' on Waaaaaa!
Nasty bitch
Bitch get the fuck out of my house bitch
Nasty bitch
The dead nigga, the mother fucker wolf game head, bitch I dodn't even know Wolves could cum my nigga

I will always love you
I need you to know that
Im gonna hold you down
Till it kills me
Im here for you
I hate to say I told you
That niggas hate
No matter what they say
Im gonna hold you down
Till it kills me
Im here for you
(The Game)
(Verse 1)
You know what they
More money,more problems,more drama
Means more marijuana and less baby momma
You know I love you like I love my shoes
But even all Nike air forces come in two
I like her and I like you 2
Whats wrong
She ma bitch and you ma boo
She gotta CLS and you gotta a Bentley Coup
She take all my clothes to the cleaners
And you take them to school
I gave you a Berkley bag
I made a mistake
And Oprah dont fuck wit them no more anyway
I know you get sick and tired of me cheating
But you forgave me
After i fucked mya
Sorry for the bullshit I put you through
I ain't gonna no where I got a kid wit you
She always say jay got beyonce and wayne
I just turn the volume up and let Keyshia Cole sing
(Chrous)
(Verse 2)
Dre told me ""Its the power of the P.U.S.S.Y""
That have a nigga daydreaming in the S.K.Y
I can't replace you ur man and put you in the S5
But I can make sure when i hit
They can hear you in bedstuy
That's B
You kno how I do
How your girlfriends get to hate Wen I ride through
Like he fucked her at wats her name
Record release party
I rather fuck with rihanna and I dont even know shawty
My alibe is I had to lie
I kiss and dont tell and hit and oh well
I make the boat sail
And ditched the hotel
If a man got a problem
Get hit with doch shells
Then after the hotel
Its the after party
With IV's in his wrist
While I'll leave with his Bitch
Blow the roof
Let her feel the breeze in the 6
They said R&b dead
But keyshia that bitch
(Chrous)
(Verse 3)
Its money that makes 7 days change
From puerto rico to watch a lakers game
I give my heart and my house and chain
Just to she your face when the roses came
You wanted me to meet your family Im on the next plane to eat dinner With your mom and P.F change
She said she will die for you and I told her I'll do the same
And i feel it in her eyes
She can see my pain
I told you I had a son
You wanted to kno his name
Harlem
But my fans call him baby game
Before his birth I was against all odds in the streets
Me and, micheal,face dodging police
My baby momma play games with me
So me and her
Like ciara and bow wow
We like Nas and Kelis
In London i told you I would give you the world
I was your LL
And you were my around the way girl

Drama is Real,Untold Story,UnKnown,"Drama is real, like not wakin up
I'm breakin up grounds when this patriot thrust
Your mouth is on shut, your emotions are hidden
For you to handle your business, you are more than driven
If you kill it no more standin on that corner like a stop sign
Everytime you spotted they call it shot time
Not at the gym but in the grim reaper's hands
You important if a bullet hits, injure your plans
This is not an adventure, but a full-time duty
If you seen how niggas hit the club, they pullin out uzis
Sometimes bruisin and grazin, mostly takin
No more sleep for the shooter, no more of that hangin
No mo' trustin hoes you ain't know fo' ten plus
No mo' smokin with the homies, no mo' late night clubs
Cause the victim, is ready to stick him like a mousetrap
I'm 'bout to rap, you better be 'bout peepin out cash

If there's blood on my Nikes I done murdered a nigga
If the stash spot smokin I done murdered a nigga
San Quinn got a hurt for the nigga, it get worser for niggas
We take this beef shit further than niggas
Streets are shady, the Game got curtains for niggas
All-of-a-sudden-ass killers never heard of these niggas
Have your whole family cryin a river, we'll murder you niggas
We take this beef shit personal nigga

I ain't met a nigga yet could fuck with this rap vet
I'm the realest since I came in the game on Kam back
Rest in peace to Mausberg, gotta live with that
Keep the M2 on my hip, I live with that
Eat with that, sleep with that, come get me
Four-fifty put somethin through your son Easter basket
Six in your truck, get you each a casket
Put termites in your box let 'em eat your cabbage
A wife right here, see if she can weave through traffic
Everybody gotta die, when the beef is active
If you know Game, you know I'll never give free passes
But I give choices, how you want it, metal or plastic
Life is real, pedal to traffic, no spots on my tail
Cops on the payroll so me and Quinn live well
And I can still get a nigga the hill, your bitch as well
Shotgun got mo' punks than shells


See the Escalade got 'em runnin downhill, snowball niggas
We throw vapors out of truck windows, blow our figures
Suede corners out the sunroof, the fifth or the Ruger
Broad daylight, blow the windows out of your Cougar
Move in the S5, plus my, leather dust fly
Spark up a dutch, Game put niggas in a coffin too much
Turn niggas kids into orphans too much, In God We Trust - nah
Keep the fifth close like Starsky & Hutch
Your daughter cryin it's just {?} tuck, but so what
Blow the dutch, southpaw bust out your whole fronts
Have you eatin soup for months, broken jaw, lick your shit out of straws
I guess I got that same ol' harm
I ain't for play, the Game is raw
Specialize in death jackets, here try these bullets on
And next time have all my cheese cause if you owe me
Guns O-U-T, we all gon' squeeze",https://genius.com/The-game-drama-is-real-lyrics
Duck Down,Game Time,UnKnown,"Yo big Chuck this one of them bangers man

Fresh out the drop Chuck Taylors hit the street crackin' the ground
There he go with the crack and the pound
I'm right here ain't no backin me down
Hands on the hot hood, Compton sheriffs pack me down
They wanna know about the tattoo tear
If I know 50, and why them guns blow like Lionel Richie
If my nine get itchy, somebody gotta pass away
Like that bitch nigga that killed Jam Master Jay
You don't like it, you can come get my ass today
I'll be waitin with a vest, ski mask and K
Niggas left me for dead back In the day
I found out It was a hard knock life without askin' Jay
It's a hard knock life then you pass away
Rest in peace to Mausberg, pour out a glass of 'Zay
This for all my niggas in Compton killin'
Give me 5 years nigga I'm bringin' Compton millions

Well I come from Murderville
Where them gangsta's and hustlers live
Little kids out on the block
Hollow points and Harlem rocks
Don't seem like it's gonna change
Look In my eyes you can feel my pain
It's a war out on them blocks
Duck down when you hear them shots

Back in the building, back to the war
By that Jackie Robinson mural I used to sell crack by that wall
Hoppin' fences with the crack in my drawers
I got bitches that'll hit the penitentiary
Stuff the crack in they walls, pause
Take off the jewels and the bandanas
Let me holler at my nigga Jim Jones and Santana
Thanks for representin', but when tecs is spittin'
One shot, spin around the block I think we left a witness
I'm from the coast where props are never given
Fuck rap, I start makin' wooden boxes for a living, nigga
They call me Sergeant Slaughter 'cause the sergeants on them
S. Carters, Von Dutch's and a quarter water
I know Jesus but he don't walk accross no water
I call him Je-sus he get that chalk accross the border
Off that Grey Goose I put that chalk around your daughter
But I got patients and I'm just what the doctor ordered

Well I come from Murderville
Where them gangsta's and hustlers live
Little kids out on the block
Hollow points and Harlem rocks
Don't seem like it's gonna change

This Way,Purp & Patron: The Hangover,2011.0,"I been looking this way, ever since I remember
And it ain't gone change
So I don't care what them people say ay-ay-ay-ay-ay
I will forever be this way ay ay ay ay ay ay
I will forever be this way

Hey yo, hey yo
Keep the game in HD on ESPN while I fuck these lesbians rubbing on they breast and then
And then light up a swisher let it fill my lungs
Reflecting on the days when I was banging in the slums
From that to number 1, at the grammy's with my gun
Thought I was winning album of the year but then Missy won
Maybe next year, they say I'm underrated I'm underappreciated and it's Mr. West here


Always stay the same
Even though I can't write it to change the game
You can never change the game, I'm just trying to make a change
Stay positive but the negative shit make it easier to make some change
So? I used to take a chain
So? I used to rob a store
So? I used to load a clip and tell my niggas time to go
Empty the clip and tell 'em hallow tip vamonos
I know it's uncommon to see a gangsta' with a common flow


Now as the time flies a rapper's albums is getting weak as fuck
I feel like I don't need this bitch feel like I don't need this truck
Keep your rabbits foot nigga I don't need the luck
All I need is my niggas a half of Oz of weed to puff
Kickin' it with this rat I'm about to beat it up
Thinkin' about droppin' this tape how ya'll gone eat it up
Take my time on you niggas ain't no need to rush
You think you seen it all, nigga you ain't seen enough


Now as we prepare for dinner
Chop the table in half this side is for the sinners
But I'm forever in limbo parked in this Lambo
Bangin' this instrumental that I got from Timbo
Wishin' I would've just burned my demo
Wishin' I would've never hopped inside the Doc's limo
But I did look at what I did
I'd give everything back except my kids (yeee)",https://genius.com/The-game-this-way-lyrics

Nigga i lock the whole block up, see the block what
You can't stop us or drop us, long nose, sluggin the drop what
We real niggas, Compton blood runnaz and gunnaz
The red raiders been on hiatus, made it back for the summer
F**k rap, it ain't about that
Hip hop is dead
You whack rappers broke one in the head
Nas said it he ain't regret it
I talk to him
Any nigga disagree
Run up on the passenger side
And put a spark to him
Phony ass rap niggas
Swear they gon clap some
Talkin out the side of they mouth
With no gat frontin
Long as i'm alive, this shit don't stop
We know who killed BIG and Pac
He gon' drop
(Talking)
You niggas think you scare me?
Nigga you don't scare me B
I'm from Compton mothaf**ka
Real life, real gangs, real shootouts mothaf**ka I took them shots
I see you standin there
So what bitch? Move!
(Verse 2)
I'm the west Don
The next one to kick his f**kin feet up
Puffin on cheeba
Niggas give me the chills
I pick the heat up
Im scared of who, you? F**k naw
I let the shit blow, circle the block, before I duck off
I stay blunted, stay around pussy
Stay liquored up wit the finest bitches
You niggas trickin
I'm wit the bucks like Milwaukee
I shoot em dead
Left hand like Michael Redd
Recycle the flow, come back
I'm dead prez
Too political
Guerilla on mass beats
Leave your career in critical condition
Destroy niggas, my mission is to disposition
All you faggots
I ain't beefin with one nigga
Theres room for all you niggas in this casket
Get in
(Talking)
All homo ass niggas, B
Niggas straight f**kin homos nigga
When you see me in the streets nigga
You dont say shit
Niggas dont be doin shit
Whole bunch of niggas man
Loud noise makers, f**k yall

I stand ova niggas wit a gun, let it hum
Your crew run, run, run, your crew run, run
I stand ova niggas wit a gun, let it hum
Your crew run, run, run, your crew run, run
I f**k ova niggas
Only give props
To them olda niggas
Snoop, Cube, Rakim, KRS
The coldest niggas
Can't forget nasty Nas
And that Hova nigga
Disrespectful tongue ? yet it still i owe them niggas
Pay homage, spray llamas
Drive Bentleys, roll through any hood
You don't believe me
Then ride wit me
Pray on the soul
On any nigga that collide wit me
He bust first, I shot back
The moral is you die wit me
(Talking)
See nigga I don't really give a f**k
About all this G-unit talk and all these punk ass records nigga
First of all you don't sell records nigga
Second of all nigga you ain't as handsome as me
Third of all you ain't f**kin as many bitches as I'm f**kin
Fourth of all you ain't got enough OG mothaf**kin homies backin you nigga

Dead Bodies,UnKnown,2004.0,"We out in this...P and Game, we'll blow that bitch up
From the world's most infamous, 1st Infantry
(Alchemist, this shit raw like fresh beef playa
We boyz in da hood...wanna see a dead body)
Sittin' in a lowrider, murda on my mind
'Cause I had too many dead homies in my lifetime
That's why I ride wit a nine and dem hollow tips
Lift niggas like a chrome hydraulic switch
Wit a hood rat in the car that swallow dicks
So good that I got P on that six-four Impala shit
She from Compton just like me
Caramel wit extensions just like Eve
She want to go to a Knicks game, sit next to Spike Lee
Well do the right thing, blow a nigga out his Nikes
She married to The Game, that's wifey
Ask Gotti get them blood stains out your white tee
P in the backseat finger fuckin' her girlfriend
That'll put a golf ball hole in your right cheek
Start trippin' over colors like Ice-T
And you can watch your life slip away through an I.V
We out in Cali, P and Game straight blow that bitch up
We out in New York, P and Game we blow that bitch up
You can't stop us, we gettin' this money its not bangin'
You can't pull that shit this way, we head bangin'
Wit dem Glocks and dem oo-ops
Me and my fools shoot, wutchu tryin' do that
I suggest you do not
My chain is hot, what's more hot than that
That's how I murda music, that's why your broads on my back
Got two birds on my shoulders, they all over me
And ready to fuck Game and whoever else roll wit me
My presence is strong, I have a bitch seein' dollar
Signs spots stare at me too long
Have you seein' that white light you come at me wrong
Or any one of my dawgs, I'll be settin' it off
You was raised on beef and live real drama
Don't let the coupes twist you, we lettin' o's off
We out in this...P and Game, we'll blow that bitch up
(P and Game rollin' the Dutch)
P and Game, we'll blow that bitch up, mixed with the A L see
NYC to LA we do our sweep
We out in Compton, P and Game lacin' Chucks
We out in QB, P and Game rollin' a Dutch
Dumpin' ashes out the windshield
Haze got my head spinnin like dem 24 inch wheels
Ridin' to Suga Hill bangin' shook ones
On the westside highway, hand on the steel
If I like your chain then blood spill
'Cause I ain't getta million dollars when I signed my deal
Nigga I'll tie your wife to a chair and blow that bitch up
You better fire proof your crib, I'll blow that shit up
I'm all about this crime shit for real, this rap shit is luck
Try to score points on me, I'll fasten you up
In that smelly proof bag, real real fast
Shoot the deuce under my arm, I'm real real slick
Can't put a tail on me, I drive too fast
Can't put tag on me, I smoke people ass
If you from the westside, nigga throw that shit up
If you bang to eastside, nigga throw that shit up
I ain't tryna be in The Source or Double X L
I'm just tryna fuck Trina 'cause Dre said sex sells
And it was either this or jail
Imagine tryna fit birds in a Honda Accel
And they caught up on the Fed Ex mail
So we stopped doin' business and chirpin' on Nextels
We gangstas
I fold people in half, I tore people ass
But they still want to ride out as long as we see death
I get money, and I don't need your help or friendship
But love, I'ma survive just how I been
I'ma stay alive till the day I die
But right now I'm healthy, niggas betta get up off my
A bitch is nuttin' we easily fuck it

Niggaz Bleed,"Stop Snitchin, Stop Lyin",2005.0,"Your boy ain't got shit, I got 10KI-s by my 26th birthday
5 bricks a Bentley Coupe, a bulletproof Suburban

I'm fresh on the bricks been out for twelve days
Lookin' for my thug bitch, nigga need some twelve play
A gangsta bitch put her lips around my 12' gauge
Who freak on foul miles, throw the pussy like Elway
Ridin' through L.A., shotgun in a Coupe
I'm ballin' in my Converse like L.J
I put nine holes in your Pelle
Fuckin' with me? I'll have white chalk where them shells lay
I'm a Goodfella, there goes the neighborhood fellas
Far from a Roc-A-Fella? I'll let the doctor tell 'em
That his heart don't work, he need a new one
That's hard to combine like seein' me in some blue ones
Air Forces with the cocaine strings
Cargo full of hunters what the dopehead brings
I'm the livin' most drug dealer, I expose niggas
Take the thug in 'em, leave 'em layin' in a blood river
You know Game count 'em, I got 'em as lottos
My quarter piece is like skiing through a cocaine mountain
For the love of a dollar, puttin' niggas in a column
Then get lost somewhere in the Caymen islands, holler

(Niggas bleed like us) Picture me bein' scared
Of a nigga that breathe the same air as me
(Niggas bleed just like us) Picture me not ridin'
My life in that man's hands while he just decidin'
(Niggas bleed like us) Picture me bein' scared
Of a nigga that breathe the same air as me
(Niggas bleed just like us) I'd rather go toe-to-toe
With all of y'all, runnin' ain't in my protocol

Niggas fakin' my city? I mistake 'em for Diddy
Claimin' he a Bad Boy, nigga simply an ac-tor
From Compton to the Boogie Down Bronx I put it down
With Dre behind me platinum plaques'll find me
Somewhere in the Cayman islands, diamonds on the Rolex
Bezels shinin' and I am, the king of rhymin', perfect timin'
Now that Roc-A-Fella belong to Def Jam
My mic is my best friend from Rikers to San Quentin
Make a move in them eight by tens
Sharin' light to my niggas in solitary, missin' their commissary
And my niggas traumatised from hearin' their momma cry
My goons supply balloons for your baby momma ties
And my verses baptise every one of you rap guys
And my eyes the first family, more like the Fab Five
So step aside, let a real nigga take flight
I ain't hype, I'm the reincarnation of Eric Wright

(Niggas bleed like us) Picture me bein' scared
Of a nigga that breathe the same air as me
(Niggas bleed just like us) Picture me not ridin'
My life in that man's hands while he just decidin'
(Niggas bleed like us) Picture me bein' scared
Of a nigga that breathe the same air as me
(Niggas bleed just like us) I'd rather go toe-to-toe
With all of y'all, runnin' ain't in my protocol

Yet still, gotta keep the K cutter close (Why)
Little niggas ain't go to 
'Til they all fryin' from the iron or they flyin' with the ghosts
With lyin' on the siren while they dyin' from the throat
When I withdraw my hands from the line of the coke
Nigga choke, then I retire in to smoke
To my natural habitat gold wires on the spokes
With the locs, like I'm supplyin' 'em with dope
A-16 bar like they firin' up an O
Designer the flow, grindin' on the low
Keep a bad little bitch with a diamond on her toe
Blindin' when I glow, stop cryin' I'm a pro
Techniec the streets 'til it's time for him to go
Or 'til they put some hot through us
I'm a fighter and the truest since Joseph Louis

So the recipe is, we bake 'em soon as Dre bake 'em
Aftermath hit makers from Compton and Jamaica
Now, where else do we gotta take 'em? New York to see Jacob
I'm L.A.'s king, ski mask like Jason
Pendleton like Freddy, red and black plague
Gangbangin' for ever, got 'em wavin' white flags
Cocaine Range, all white mags
Tell the white liar, leave you in a white bag",https://genius.com/The-game-niggaz-bleed-lyrics
Gettin’ American Money Easy,G.A.M.E,2006.0,"(The Game)
Live now, die later, flood or clock the shit out of haters
Got niggas tryin to ""Kiss the Game Goodbye"" like Jada
Get your shit pushed back like Jada's CD
I'll put your brains on that Kenwood TV
So you can see hell in 3D, it's right there dog
And the Game behind the Desert is a nightmare dog
If it's pussy, I might share it dog, beef I'm right here dog
I'm on the block, white Nike Airs on
Gucci check, Coogi sweat, they wanna know
If 22's on the truck, give me coochie yet
But I come through in the new GS with two, three tecs
Got niggas Harlem Shakin like the new G. Dep
Tryin to read my whole script, but ain't seen the movie yet
Better have that Glock stuffed tonight
I'm comin through with Young Noble, and we, gon', make, it
A block bust tonight
(Chorus 2X: The Game)
Getting American Money Easy, all I know
The Gangsta All Motherfuckers Envy, all my dough
It's a West coast knot, watch, let it bang out
Shots range out, for all the gangsta hangouts
(The Game)
Lace your tips, polish your gators, we like odds in Vegas
You can't ball? Then it's probably the haters
Can't breathe then it's probably the Desert, if you a gangsta or not
I give a fuck dog, bullets is hot
And every nigga gon' cry when he hit, the more pain
The more blood drain, he ain't survivin shit
And your niggas ain't gon' ride for shit, they know
If they came through everybody in the X-5 is hit
Red rag or blue rag, niggas die for this
The Game the reason all these niggas on that ""Cali Love"" shit
Compton niggas get grimy too, pull you out of that 6
Fuck you up like one time'll do
And I dare y'all to stop on the 'Shaw, and King Boulevard
Comin hard, Doogie Howser pullin bullets out your jaw
Turn your round trip into a one-way ticket
You can visit, but you can not lie and kick it
(Chorus)
(Young Noble)
Aiyyo, we left a stain on your block, you came with a cop
Pointin fingers at them niggas, that kept shit hot
Next to 'Pac, I'm the hottest thang out, homey we can bang out
Outlaw air it out, box 'em in, square it out
Learn about your whereabouts and we right there
Me and Game have you left right there
N-O-B-L-E, O-U-T-L-A-W-Z
We bubble with ease, and I double my cheese
I got niggas out in Compton that'll find yo' ass
I got niggas out in Jersey, that'll hide yo' ass
For a long time if you ever fuckin with mine
It's a thin line dog between the real and the fraud
We killin your squad, my homeboy still in the yard
You the type of motherfcuker standin next to the God
The Game is deep, you motherfuckers ain't the streets
Young Noble and the homey Game flamin heat, c'mon

Walk Thru the Sky,Untold Story: Volume II,2005,"Open your eyes, we in a new era
Less drama more unity, everything's lookin a lil' clearer
Like a face in the mirror karma
It was right before our eyes, facin the future I cried
No more Martin Luther shots, from off the words from Malcolm
Tunes from Jimi, it's sad but you gotta hear me
All praises due to the mighty Allah, God forgive me
I've been through it, but it's not all bad in me
A young kid tryin to change his ways
Every day a lil' closer, show him the light let him pave the way
Gotta see my grave someday, no more cheddar, some pictures
Grandma I'm comin to spend forever wit'cha, I miss ya
No more Sunday dinners, wish you could see your grandson now
Got bigger, all grown now
Got a daughter think she grown now, just started walkin
Just started talkin, she can potty on her own now
Life is good, memories are better
We all gotta go, I know it's cold grab a sweater
We can take that ride together, cry whatever, die whatever

Somebody tell em 2Pac never die
Somebody tell em the Biggie is in my ride

And try to make that type of love that never in
Do whatever I can to stay irrelevant
Be the elephant in a world full of vouchers
When nobody can social, that’s my culture
Well I’m cool in, I’d rather be on little acting of fulling
Best in my Louie Vuitton bet with the tool in
Just cool in, made a mistake I got an old job roof in
Say she met working, who stop who is this rolling the money

Got a question for the haters can you swim
I am thinking so, so ain’t nothing to prove in

Everybody hands up in the air
I’m just trying spread love everywhere
Everywhere, everywhere
Everybody hands up in the air
I’m a kid full of projects, but drivin some
You think isn’t for an object

And all my haters like damn he ain’t dodgin
Go bum under the vibe we couldn’t kill big
Unless this, last to the.. conquer
Can’t thrill me in New York sign the middle
Couldn’t chill me a mother fuckin more

Tell my Houston partner I’m trill b

Why You Hate,UnKnown,UnKnown,"(Chorus Marsha Of FLoetry)
To everybody who knows my story
To all those who came before me
My time is now, i'm gonna do it all over again
Ain't nothin' new, but the changed
I'm still gonna do it my way
I still remain, so tell me why you hate the game?
Oh no oh no
So tell me why you hate the game?
Oh no no no
This time ill do it better just because
(Nas)
Y'all know who it is...
The streets named me Illmatic, for that I'm still at it..
Can't hate us....
Felling...
(Verse 1)
Vice behind me on the intersection
Sex and drugs, my anthology on perfection
Dress superb, admired by conspirers
Who wanna try me, but ain't high enough to four-five me up
Child of the eighties, y'all niggas is lazy
Complain about labour pains, n***a show me the baby
And my nigga Game, light another L, pass the bottle
Pro-black, I don't take cotton out of aspirin bottles
Yeah, I learnt my lessons, and heard y'all snitchin'
Witnessin' you rockin' with NaS, confirmed my suspicion
Green fatigues on, My niggas I bleed for 'em
I can show 'em the water, but can't make 'em drink it
And I can show 'em my fortunes but can't force 'em to think rich
And still at on bottom wondering if they sink quick
Ignore the ignorance, I rep the brilliance of Queensbridge
And pray to feds, let Murder Inc. live...
(Chorus Marsha Of FLoetry)
To everybody who knows my story
To all those who came before me
My time is now, i'm gonna do it all over again (some how)
Ain't nothin' new but the changed
I'm still gonna do it my way
I still remain, so tell me why you hate the game?
(The Game)
I don't talk about my guns, nigga I just blaze....
(Verse 2)
'Pac is watchin', Big is listenin'
While Pun talkin' to us, Jam Jay still spinnin'
To every nigga listenin'
I was supposed to be amongst kings, my Mom shouted out at my Christening
And while you still listenin', Shyne locked in a man hole
Cam got shot inside his lambo', example, life is a gamble
15 years old red rag around my hand, My sisters used to laugh and call me 'Rambo'
Seen Eazy's legacy melt away like a candle
I rekindled the flame
Dre created The Game
Nigga with attitude from the cloth I came
Young homie ate his way up from the bottom of the food chain
Keep the crown, clown, I rock an LA Dodger Fitted, showed my ass at Summer Jam but New York was down with it
Now the ball's in my court, never dribble out of bounds with it
Behind the back to Nas, he alley oop to Jigga, Nigga
(Chorus Marsha Of FLoetry)
To everybody who knows my story
To all who those came before me
My time is now, i'm gonna do it all over again (some how)
Ain't nothin' new but the change changed
I'm still gonna do it my way
I still remain, so tell me why you hate the game?
(The Game Verse 3)
Check it, Me and nasty puffin', this a classic, trust me
I even pas the dutchie to them niggas that don't love me
I'm talkin' niggas that never wanted to see me on top
Same niggas that never wanted to see the Doctor's Advocate drop, flop, I think not
I'll f**k you rap niggas like virgins
Dre took my training wheels off his curtains
I don't need no encore, no claps, no cheers
The Game ain't over, this the beginning of my career
The ending of yours, the endin of his
Like Flavor Flav's clock, I'm back to handle my biz
Nigga, it's Game Time, that was Dre's favorite line
Back when proof was in the booth and I recited his lines
And I still think about my nigga from time to time
Make me wanna call 50, and let him know what's on my mind
But I just hold back 'cause we ain't beefin' like that
He ain't Big, and I ain't Pac, and we just eatin off rap
One love.(echoe)
(Chorus Marsha Of FLoetry)
To everybody who knows my story
To all those who came before me
My time is now, i'm gonna do it all over again (some how)
Ain't nothin' new but the changed
I'm still gonna do it my way
I still remain, so tell me why you hate the game?

Just Beginning (Where I’m From),Untold Story: Volume II,2005,"Sometimes I wonder
Man, how long is it gon' be for my people to come out
Man we strugglin, it's hard sometimes, but
Tomorrow's better than yesterday, uhh

I was, born in the slums, struggled from day one
Ray Charles vision, blinded by the light from the sun
No navigation, no sense of direction, darker complexion
Made it hard to live; dad, how you fathered your kids?
Stranded on the highway of life, left us out to die, left us out to dry
Shhhh, I'm still here, my mother's cries
Nigga no father figures make harder niggas
Through the years, went to war with niggas from what I saw in the picture
Now your son is bigger, 13, but just like you
Moms said I would grow up and be just like you
From what you did to my sister she disliked you
Sixteen, eleventh grade, look at me just like you
Gunnin for riches, runnin hoppin project fences
Street corners to Arizona, how I earn my digits
And I'm far from finished, gamin 'til my coffee diminish
Why pray for the afterlife when mines just beginnin, huh

Only son by our mother, no brothers, only sisters by this one
Every time I kissed one I missed one, let me explain
Eight years before the game, everything came with pain
Watch the fate of my family slain would never see good times a-gayn
Cursed with pain by a nigga with no shame
My father, that have the same name as his father
My grandfather wouldn't believe, he pulled up our family tree
I can see him rollin over in his coffin
I'm left with often, thoughts of how could you molest your daughter
They say that's ten times worse than manslaughter
Man you oughta, be dead in a grave
But it wasn't my call, so instead you sat in a cage
High-powered, two-hundred and fifty pound, six-five coward
Woulda been dead in an hour
Heard you was scared to take a shower, scared of the yard
Your end is near, you shoulda been scared of God, motherfucker",https://genius.com/The-game-just-beginning-where-im-from-lyrics
RED CITY,UnKnown,UnKnown,"""Leave the angels in the city""

Tell them muthafuckas I'm forever paid
California king, wrestle gators in the Everglades
Drive up out that muthafuckin swamp in the Escalade
So before you put that Red rag in your pocket
I wanna see your fuckin resume
Started off on Ground Zero, then I start to levitate
Rip rappers a new asshole: I never hesitate
Dre beats on, smoking that chronic just to meditate
I'm a give em hurricanes until another Levee break
You niggas is featherweights, I'm Aftermath's heavyweight
Now Dre's weapon of mass destruction is 'bout to detonate
When a nigga whack, found me shit, I was selling weight
Now a nigga's selling millions, now it's time to celebrate
Performing in front of millions, nigga, every race
6-4 in the '64, now watch the Chevy scrape
4th album, no 5 mics? Then let em hate
But I'm not stopping til I'm the king in every state

Recognize my life, ridicule my fight
Give me fuel for the fire burning when I yearn these lights
In the midst of the hieroglyphs my fingertips start to write
Familiar with cartwright, cause I wrote that shot, I'm a raging bull
When the needle drops. For the record, I'm a wreck it, even if my record don't pop
I'm a tie a knot on a Downtown building
Let it toll behind me tell em they can find me
In the dark with the ghetto children
Look at my heart, nigga fuck your feelings
This is me!

I'm sick of motherfuckers talking about ""the West died""
Can't you hear my heart beating?
That's the motherfuckin West side, you test me, you test God
I'm his son, it says in Psalms, you come at me
Then I can split you with this Tommy gun
You won't have time to run, I'm from the Compton slums
And that's how the West ride
I'm from the city where 2 of the best died
Rest in peace to both of em, spit like I'm the ghost of em
Damn, I said I spit like I'm the ghost of em
Name your top 10, I'm harder than the most of em
Matter of fact, shorten your list nigga, top 5
Game, Biggie, Hov, prolly Pac, Nas
No particular order, bet a mil that I slaughter
Serve niggas, give a fuck what you ordered
How dare you niggas pop fly when I'm the nigga
Sold 5 mil out the gate and numbers do not lie

Recognize my life, ridicule my fight
Give me fuel for the fire burning when I yearn these lights
In the midst of the hieroglyphs my fingertips start to write
Familiar with cartwright, cause I wrote that shot, I'm a raging bull
When the needle drops. For the record, I'm a wreck it, even if my record don't pop
I'm a tie a knot on a Downtown building
Let it toll behind me tell em they can find me
In the dark with the ghetto children
Look at my heart, nigga fuck your feelings
This is me!

I gave you the Documentary, shit was a classic
Gave you Doctor's Advocate, you ripped it out the package
Came with LAX, since critics said it was average
I was stressed the fuck out, torn between Aftermath and
Geffen, Interscope, now I got you in the scope
Spill the red ink on the paper, it's like my pen is broke
And this is what you all been waiting for
I'm the lost angel knocking on Satan's door
What the fuck y'all take me for?
I love you cause you hate me more
I'm Kobe on the Lakers floor, except I give you 84
Shake you like Haiti's floor
Walk up on you like ""what's going on baby boy? ""
Shots in that Mercedes door
Either I'm crazy, or the black Slim Shady, or
That be the reason that Baby said he would pay me more
But I still owe Jimmy one more album
The best the West has ever seen - no disrespect to Calvin

Recognize my life, ridicule my fight
Give me fuel for the fire burning when I yearn these lights
In the midst of the hieroglyphs my fingertips start to write
Familiar with cartwright, cause I wrote that shot, I'm a raging bull
When the needle drops. For the record, I'm a wreck it, even if my record don't pop
I'm a tie a knot on a Downtown building
Let it toll behind me tell em they can find me
In the dark with the ghetto children
Look at my heart, nigga fuck your feelings
This is me!

And I wear a pendant on my shoulder
Soldier, like a lieutenant, and the coupe tinted
Got pulled over, Johnny always lock a nigga down
Knowing damn well we don't wanna see the box like Manny Pacquiao
Little nigga Mayweather size, ride like Pac in his prime
Thug life is now on radar
Til the federal come through and raid ours
Reminiscing on the LA Raiders
Was in my home, snapback fitted on my uncle's dome
And I don't condone dickriding, I'm addicted to
Westsiding, living in a city where the skinny niggas die
And the semi bullets fly, but it turn me to a lion
Trying, and I mean that shit
Game came through, put the city on his back
I was in the city,where a nigga had seen that shit

They can't cop what the bricks'll cost
But we stay in the lane to maintain in the 6 to floss
Leather gloves with the tips to toss
But the money was made from conversation had to clip the boss
Smash down at the V.I.P
Street smarts is crucial for young niggas in the CX-3
Drop Jag with the price to pay
Cause the bags was heavy my chain swangin like a ice capade
Got the feds lookin twice this way
Cause we shuffle the P's in different places that the {?} name
Compton to Fillmoe man the game is real
When you turn 15 get your stainless steel
Whole squad been trained to kill, we official
And switch to get rich now we after the meals
Hard times got cakes for 3
When it's havin a bundle we break bread for the safe and flee nigga


I got guns, guns, guns, guns
Guns all over the club
We in V.I.P. strapped, security know that
25 deep, guns up under the throwback
That new R. Kelly shit sound like Bobby Womack
Black Wall Street in HURR, nigga where the hoes at
We got sour diesel, three cases of Hypnotiq
And more guns than the Nickerson Projects
Niggas don't want beef with me
Cause they know they gotta pay for talkin shit but the sheets is free
And ain't nuttin to shoot the club up
You don't want drama in this motherfucker throw them dubs up
Jacob got the wrists on chill
And N.W.A. chain glow like the memory of Ill Will
Relax your mind and let your drawers feel free
You're now rollin to the sound of the Game and JT


But you can't come with the rest of her friends
Cause you know I'm a boss and won't play cause she short on my ends
Make rounds from the back of the Benz
With the {?} that kid with frog eyes with the corners to bend
The things we go through I'm beatin ya brains
Got some homies next do' and I picked up the Game
While they knockin on the do' I get deep in ya dame
Gotta charge you a G just for speakin my name

I'm not eatin your chocha or payin for the coach ma
I'm a pimp like 50, the nigga to leave you broke ma
6 in the mornin, you stretchin on the sofa
Singin ""Ain't No Nigga"" like Foxy Brown and Hova
I fuck 'em dogstyle with Billys and Novas
With or without chaffeurs, I make 'em fuck the both of us
You know what it is, the gangster's back
And I keep my banger at where my chain hang at

So pull it, cock it and tell Dre I'm on one

And get a call from the big homie nigga you dead
I'll put a 50 cent sized hole in back of your head
Let the nina full of hollow tips put you to bed

Run up on him for the bread, the ski mask way
Started listening to LAX flyin away
Guess it's all entertainment at the end of the day
Cause on some real shit, they don't really wanna die today
I'll do my homework, find out your hide-away
Then cross a nigga over like Tim Hardaway
Boyz in tha Hood, he'll get shot with the A.K
Make em fill like they're in Iraq right now today
Sweat bleeding under the sun, bitch I ain't the one

I'm from B town, niggas get money where I'm from
Gang bangin heavy dawg, stay strapped where I'm from

Go and hurt somebody if I don't hit that

And if you don't care so much about my fame
Then why you keep starin' at my chain

Shorty keep it comin' boy, I'm grown

Gutta Boyz,West Coast Resurrection,2005.0,"(We gangsta daddy!)

(Yuh!)
I'm sippin on that 'notiq the color of Hulk man
And the blueberry smoke got a nigga twerkin
You niggas is perkin - so you doin it big?
You roll deep but when I see you it's just you and your kids
I roll sick, my rims feel like helicopter propellers
And my pockets run deep like a Mercer teller
Haters trip when they see the whip dippin by
The paint on it change like the I-95
I'm just Clyde, without the Bonnie, I got the hollowpoint
Heat for you niggas and the po' for the mamis
Sean Gotti, I'm puttin an end to camraderie
I'm lettin off heat, 'til them eyes get watery
Some gon' ricochet, some gon' hit, y'all gon' get 'em
Fluids gon' disperse out like refreshin club serum
I'm deadly as bite venom but I'm far from a snake
I'll hit you up on your birthday while you cuttin your cake

We gangsters nigga; you see the cars, the whips
The chains, the fuckin broads we with
We gangsters nigga; we'll come through your hood
A hundred deep and empty the whole clip
We gangsters nigga; we got guns for the beef
And my niggas'll put you under the street
We gangsters nigga; so you better watch what you say
'Fore I empty the whole Glock in your face

Streets is tough, but ain't no hopscotch lines on the ground
Just burner shells, and police siren sounds
Niggas know who I am in the town; it ain't a circus
But it might as well be, cause you know I'mma clown
I'm a terrain boss, I know most niggas envious dawg
And if a nigga owe me change you better give me it dawg
If you feelin like you wanna leap, make like a frog
You niggas lame, transparent like Wonder Woman's plane
I'm a stunna in this game, a federal figure
Blowin doj' in the hummer, 50 K on my fingers
I'm like a NASCAR winner poppin Mo' and Bill{?}
D-Squad don't give a fuck about nobody else
I pull a {?} to contain your whole, clique for hours
The end result will probably be, pinewood and flowers
So I'll advise you deduct your QP's and powder
We gangsters and we jacking cowards (yup!)


S.T. nigga D-Squad, G.G.D
Don't get it twisted motherfucker yeah we do creep
We ride out thug, shit we don't die
We lay low like mechanics tryin to fix up rides
A lot of cats say I'm sick in the head, when I anger it's on
Poodles gon' be up missin or dead
I chop haters up, like an old-ass sample
Or creep through your village, like Stallone in ""Rambo""
I'm like piranhas on red meat, I'm on you niggas
You afros? Then I guess I got to comb you niggas
So break bread, when you see me dawg hit the flo'
I'm like a nigga off the X, unpredicta-ble
Imitators always hollerin how gangsta they is
But got about as much courage as the Lion in ""The Wiz""
Shit I'm into pullin shanks on you fake Jake cats
Me and my burner hold it down man we go way back",https://genius.com/The-game-gutta-boyz-lyrics

My seeds grow and his seeds marry his seeds
That's how we keep Wu-Tang forever, baby

It's good to see the Wu-Tang family under one roof
We celebrate, toastin' shots, Ciroc 40 proof
Burgers on the grill and fried fish
The wiz made potato salad, greens for a side dish
Cold water, mill and reminisce with cousins and sisters
Children on the grass playin' ball and Twister
Fresh lemonade is made, we playin' spades
My nephews turn the livin' room into an arcade
Aunt's cherry baked pie, surprise, Johnny showed up
You can tell from the smell in the air, somethin' rolled up
It's love, peace and happiness, with the joy and laughter
Camera phones flashes, the moment is captured

It's so nice to see all the folks you love together
Sittin' and talkin' 'bout all the things that's been goin' down

It's goin' down
We rock all in together now, Wu-Tang forever now
Twenty years later we still bang whatever now
Turn change to cheddar
If I could take a quote from Obama, change is better
I vow to never let you down
Remember Meth Tical?
In my circle haters was never 'round
I'm a boss, hold that together loud
Reunited, the whole world excited
Wu-Tang is for the kids and people and girls invited

Family reunion
Got to have a family reunion
Family reunion
It's so nice to come together
To get together
I wish grandma could see
The whole family
I sure miss her face
And her warm and tender embrace

I miss my grandmother, my auntie and Unique Ason
I knew Dirt was high when he had that face on
Fangs hangin' out his mouth, his fronts was golden
Wildin', record execs can't control him
He said ish like me and Mariah
Hit me, woah-woah-woah, that's fire
Still no matter what we gon' rep the name
Look at your family, we got twenty years in the game

A family reunion
Gonna have a family reunion ooh, ooh
Family reunion
It's so nice to come together
To get together

Aye yo
I'd like to make a toast to my Wu-Tang family

My B*tch,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Let me tell you a story about this bitch I know
Grew up on the south side sucking dicks for dough
Give her a half a dollar, she'll put on a show
Do anything to be in a Dr. Dre video
The bitch went Hollywood, one trip to the west coast
She got fucked by this white bitch, had her legs wide open
As long as my pockets were fat
I didn't give a fuck where the bitch was at
My pretty young bitch keep my nuts drained
But all the time she was plotting on my aftermath chain
Bitch couldn't stay in here lane
Started running with this hoe from the south
Gold grill in her mouth, she put her on the track
Gave her, her first thong introduced her
To her two girlfriends from back home
Fucked the industry, tryna take the fast route
Ran into a gangster and he turned they ass out
You gon' always be my bitch, my bitch, my bitch
And I'm a always love my bitch, my bitch, my bitch, my bitch
I can always fuck my bitch, my bitch, my bitch
And she gon' always be my bitch, my bitch, my bitch, my bitch
From the projects hustled all day
Niggas called her Sophie from around the way
Used to play hard to get, so they thought she was gay
Booshie bitch who ever thought she was raised in BK
Moved out the hood, changed her name to Jay
Told everybody she'll be working with a mill one day
I was introduced to her back in '96
She had a wavy haircut and some big ass lips
At first she was hard to hit, come to find out
The last 10 years she been sucking Big dick
Got a family now, a house made of bricks
Four grown ass kids and ain't none of them shit
She still my bitch so I stayed around
But she always tryna dash when other dame's around
She tryna play The Game, but I got the bitch number
She said she won't, but she'll be back next summer
You gon' always be my bitch, my bitch, my bitch
And I'm a always love my bitch, my bitch, my bitch, my bitch
I can always fuck my bitch, my bitch, my bitch
And she gon' always be my bitch, my bitch, my bitch, my bitch
Last but not least my gangsta bitch
From Compton always in and out of jail and shit
Bitch tried to burn Snoop, stole chronic from doc
Blew the whole west coast, even tried to fuck Pac
Type of bitch to stand on Beverley Hills
Word on the street's she got a few real niggas killed
I look up now she on my dick
Telling me how she always gonna be my bitch
Pop up at award shows always following me
Bitch doing dumb shit, got a college degree
No pre-nupt, one nigga got stick with her
I was smart knew always not to fuck with her
What goes around comes around
Scandalous shit, somebody tried to kill that bitch
Burnt the bridges and ain't had one friend left
Niggas that know her called her the devil in that red dress
You gon' always be my bitch, my bitch, my bitch
And I'm a always love my bitch, my bitch, my bitch, my bitch
I can always fuck my bitch, my bitch, my bitch

What Happened To That Boy (Freestyle),UnKnown,2003.0,"(Intro)
Somebody better tell these niggas N.W.A is back..
Yo, Whoo Kid let 'em know!
Eazy has just left the building..
(Verse)
What happened to that boy?
He ran with the wrong gang
Fucked up in the hood, brought fiends the wrong cane
N.W.A nigga..yeah Compton still crooked
Make niggas fly off them ropes like Jimmy Fly Snuka
Your Neighborhood pusher..and I got them clips
Streets is talking, ''Game got shot by crips!''
It's okay, the kid catch bullets like Tim Brown
And your right back in the field with the rock like Jim Brown
The young gun..Not Memphis Bleek
The protege of Doc Dre with them bricks for cheap
I hustle in the C.P.T. where they play for keeps
No money in the dice game nigga, we play for pinks
And the kid got a 6-8 game like T-Mack
With N.W.A on his neck like Eazy-E back
And the desert eagle bang like a D-R-E track
So try to ball and get left with Pat Ewing kneecaps
I'm gangsta like tan khakis and air max
Chuck Taylors and Evisu jeans
The kid gotta raw flow..Niggas think he from Queens
I love rap..but Dre I gotta please the fiends!
Plus my daughter need some things, So I got Roc in Philly like Freeway, Chris, Neef and Beans
I got birds in Boston, but I ain't on no dream team
I'm on the block in a McLaren that's chronic leaf green
And I run with the A-Team, do my doc dre thing
I retire you in that 6th like Docter J's team
And I'm still gangbanging..
Tan khaki suit, red rag in my back pocket, N.W.A chain hanging
Leave your brains hanging for less than a dollar
So if you ain't got a vest better holla
We got those impalas, new handguns and yay for sale
Give you a dope track so you ain't gotta pay Pharrell
And I ain't never spent a day in jail
But I move weight like whales
On Rosecrans with a 8th on the scale
So you ain't gotta ask Dre..if I bang in Compton
Just know, when I'm cuffed I'm going straight to the gang module
In a county blue C-B-P on my neck
And walk the mainline with AT&T on my chest
The kid hit the streets, he in the vest with a hood rat from Compton with a tattoo of Eazy-E on her breasts
She gone ride, it don't matter homies or cold D's
Heads up, That revolver spin like gold D's
And you ain't got to know The Game to know he from Compton
And the motto is ''Fuck the police!''
Holla!
(Outro)
Yeah..Aftermath nigga..'03 and after that!
We running this rap shit..
Be concerned..
It's The Game aka Chuck Taylor..
I'm coming nigga..a hundred miles and running..
You know I got to holla at my nigga D-Mack, the black George Clooney
It's our turn nigga..
Whoo Kid..I told you they wern't ready dawg..

Got the crooked cops, a lots of little birdies, in the hood
You'll get buried, in the hood
Bright and early, in the hood
Thugs will put a 30-30 slug firmly, in ya hood, what's good?
We could hood it down, and make it happen
Before I made it rappin', I was more dedicated to aggravated scrappin'
The chin tappin', that crackin' your jaw pimp slappin'
I been baggin' the bad broads, I been mackin'
I been packin' the mack 10s, I been clappin'
Before the twins crashed in Manhattan, I bin laden
So quit the actin' before I capture ya life
You'll catch a lashin', through your ass like the Passion of Christ, nigga

Lama on ya, so I'm down to ride (to ride)
I ain't the type to let the drama slide (drama slide)
Bring your armor when you come outside (come outside)

Pop the lama, leave you dramatized (dramatized)
Y'all don't wanna see ya mama cry (mama cry), (Cuban Link)
Cause I won't show no mercy (no mercy)

Nigga I'm made
Call the Brooklyn zoo, let 'em know the gorillas out his cage
One hand on the holy Koran, one hand on the gage
Call fifty, tell 'em send the brigade
Whenever my pin out, homie I'm a grenade
I'm from Compton, where niggas don't die of old age
When you see son out, better put on shades
Cause I shine like Easy and Pun in they last days
See the problem is- niggas gettin' old
I'm startin' a new chapter, and we ain't on the same page
I stole the crown, I'm a damn good crook
You ain't gotta go to Ryker's to get ya manhood took
They don't like me- fuck 'em
You don't want me to be the reason niggas climbin' 'em fences at the rutger
Don't get it twisted- I love NY

Yo, when I'm out in Oakland, catch me in the silver and black Coupe
With two Desert Eagles and an ounce of glue
When I'm out in San Fran, the P.D. real nervous
Cause they know I'm packin heat under the Willie Mays jersey
Nigga, it ain't nuttin for me to empty a clip
Or wave my guns in the air and just enter ya strip
I know about gangs, had shootouts with plenty of Crips
I sold crack and been out of town with plenty of bricks
So ain't nuttin you can tell me, about the game
Come with beef and leave here without your brains
And I'ma drive upstate and try to bounce this 'caine
In that Shelby the same color as moutanin rain
And you know I got the South clickin
Cause ain't nuttin like niggas with gold teeth and them down South chickens
So fuck with my D and get found wit'cha mouth missin
This ain't about you and me it's about business nigga
(Chorus: repeat 2X)
It's business never personal, real live on blocks
If we ain't movin the rocks, then we movin the stocks
Cross a hustler motherfucker you'll arrive in a box
It's the true to life struggle 'til we arrive on top
(JT)
They don't understand me, like the Birdman I got candy
Put the herb in, I got family
I'm doin 85, in the 50-mile-an-hour lane
Tryin to handle my business, the Figgaro stack change
Independent tycoons (tycoons) - yeah
My niggas puff trees, snort coke and chew shrooms
Bad to the bone (to the bone)
And cain't trust a nigga for shit cause Feds on the phone
My whole crew dirty, fuckin with amphetamines
Catch you slippin blow your whole crew to smitharines
Now the streets knowin (knowin)
And I'ma run this shit back with my foot broke like Terrell Owens
Still blowin

We take trips out to Houston and D.C

All the money in the world couldn't change me
No diamond rings or them fancy cars
Cause my niggas in the hood woulda let me
Holler this because
(I'm from the ghetto) I'm from the ghetto
(I'm from the projects) I'm from the projects
All over the world and every hood they know
I'm from the ghetto and that's fo' sho'

All over the world and every hood they know

Ayo Cali
Walk with me
Yeah that's what got me here
The chucks the khaki suits
All the swap meet years
The six dollar socks the five dollar rocks
Uncle Greg rest in peace he taught me how to chop
That's why I love the hood and everything we got
From the ice cream trucks to the forty ounce tops
All white Air Force Ones to fake Jacob watch
A few reasons why I drive the Bentley hard top
Use it in my songs cause I live it on the block
Tattoo it on my face let the whole world watch
I'm that type of nigga y'all made my city bigger dog
Turn the TV off got tired of watchin' Jigga boss
So we told our mom's we was lookin' for jobs
When we was really in the record store lookin' for Nas
Project of the ghetto, Ghetto and the project
From Compton to being Dre's number one prospect so
All the money in the world couldn't change me
No diamond rings or them fancy cars
Cause my niggas in the hood woulda let me
Holler this because

Yeah ugh
They know
Yeah ugh
Ain't no help there just food stamps
Weight checks and welfare
Every man gone for self there
Still might need to borrow your medicade card for health care
Yeah if you never got knocked then you made it
Everybody know each other if not they related
You can get shot or get bladed
There's dudes that got jobs now that had blocks in the eighties
Six months five years for you just to cop out
Ninth or tenth grade is usually when niggas drop out
Fights break out when you wired and start joking
A lot of OG's retired and started smokin'
House party games of spade sweet kool-aid
Loud music all night till the boys in blue raid
So therefore I could never be too paid
I know where I'm going and where I'm from will get you laid
All the money in the world couldn't change me
No diamond rings or them fancy cars
Cause my niggas in the hood woulda let me

I'm from the ghetto and that's fo sho'
Haha
Tell me this how come
Black folks get a little doe
And forget where they come from
Man we used to have good times
But since you moved on up you ain't cool with us
We still support you tho we don't see you much
You ain't the first fool its cool with us
But why you living out your idols dreams
Remember how for you came and help you keep those thangs
Now its cool that your address changed
But I'm tryna holla at my dog and the number ain't the same
I guess new homies came with his fame
But see true homies will stay the same
Through all the up's and down's in your career
A couple wives few kids scattered here
And when you dead or broke without a deal
All the groupies cleared
The ghetto will still be here
All the money in the world couldn't change me
No diamond rings or them fancy cars
Cause my niggas in the hood woulda let me

On Doggystyle. Ha ha!

This could be the day you try
This could be the day you walk away or
This could be the day you die
Yeah motherfucker, you hear my shit in the club
When you do, 9 out of 10 times, I'm in the club
Stop fucking with Cristal, I can't pay that price
I take twenty 40 ounces and a bucket of ice
Pour it on my niggas, now they flooded with ice
Niggas hate me to my death, cause I'm loving my life

Throwing shit on the wall, not at the food slot
Got connects with pops, we boofin' the weed planes
Hit my khaki's, watched them pressed for food stamps
Respectin' the jail or checkin' the mail
I stay on the phone, I don't put collect on the bill
You let them DC niggas have sex in your cell
You live with a gun, you like getting' hit from the front
Stand some shit, like two dicks with no bitch
Rumor has it, you like your chicks with no tits

Give you a reason to do that dumb shit with your hands
Piss in your mouth and burn your promotional van
Come to your wake and slap all 3 of your fans
Get your mind right
Or get your mind put right next to them all white Air Nikes
Nails in your coffin leave them locked air tight
Let him scream G-unit with dust in his wind pipes

Screw some broads and I'm still cool with Nas
Ya real suttle still, so fuckin' ill
How you can turn an idea into a couple mill
But everybody got they hand in the pot
So either you cut them off or hand them a knot
And I ain't neva planning to stop, I'm planning to rock
Till the rims matchin' the top and the fantom is drop
They'll neva get away with the shit I pull off god
Knifes on the clutch even though I pull off hard
And you know the old kiss, you don't know the grown kiss
Got 'bout 5 in me until I get homesick
Still got access to the 2 tone bricks
Terry cloth sweats and Wally's that pretty tone shit

Talkin 'bout what your gameplan used to be
They got us choppin up game through the fog and smoke
We came a long way but still we got so far to go

Yeah I know I got 4 to go, so with these bars I flow
At a pace for the papes I thank y'all should know
I lace it properly for property, it really ain't no stoppin me
And plus I'm tryin to get my money on like Monopoly
Politickin economy, if I could be a made nigga
Smokin on e'ry nigga, balled out paid nigga
Keepin it real, I'm still deep in the field
Deep with the skills for the bills
I got the million dollar mouthpiece with no gold grill
I bring the thrill like Will Clark
I will bust I will spark and flame in the booth
You blind you shoulda saw it when I came in the booth
I serve the thunder, that shit that'll brang in the roof

My niggas, stack riches, mack bitches
Blow fast Swishers with my folks, act vicious with my folks
Sav livin with my vo-cals, Outlaw like my nigga No-ble
Fuckin bad bitches at the hotel
There's nothin to a boss, man we live it up
Smash for the cash and respect so when we mash niggas give it up
I got no time for that fake shit
Jersey to the Bay niggas thuggin even bitches thinkin they sick
So nigga basically the world is a ghetto
Play a nigga out his scratch, he gon' be twirled in a meadow
I keep it real with niggas that be true to me
There's nothin you can do to me
My crew is deep and real niggas rule the streets


Lace your Timbs, polish your gators, we like odds in Vegas
You can't ball then it's probably the haters
Can't breathe then it's probably the desert, if you a gangster or not
I give a fuck dawg, bullets is hot
And every nigga gon' cry when he hit
The more pain the more blood drain, he ain't survivin shit
And your niggas ain't gon' ride for shit, they know
If they came through everybody in the X-5 is hit
Red rag or blue rag, niggas die for this
The Game the reason all these niggas on that ""Cali Love"" shit
Compton niggas get grimy too, pull you out of that 6
Fuck you up like one time'll do
And I dare y'all to stop on the 'Shaw, and King Boulevard
Pull it hard, Doogie Howser pullin bullets out your jaw
Turn your round trip into a one-way ticket
You can visit, but you can not lie and kick it

It's time for me to shine, life on the grind, life on the line
Feelin like I'm runnin out of time
It's now or never, chasin this cheddar 'til things get better
These streets got me hungry as ever
Can't stop can't change, young Sav stuck in the game
Everyday we gotta hustle and slang, struggle and strain
To bubble, weed plus the 'caine to juggle
Organize the brains and muscle


You {?} like Sammy did Gotti, told 'em we kamikaze
Like those whiteboys ain't heedin the robbery
Told 'em we ride around in them cars on them big wheels
In the killing field makin 100 bills on the P-700 Pirelli wheels
Marshall Faulk in to ball again in this day to day scrimmage
'Bout the spinach this game is relentless where we livin
Niggas'll 32 round ya, kick you on the ground
After they down ya, sneak ya and plot ya, Heckler & Koch ya
Got ya body bein scrutinized by a flock of doctors
Still an unsolved mystery, statistically, history

City of Angels, the flow, God, is heaven sent
Straight out the hood, I’m the nigga to chase
And it been that way since the beef with Jigga and Ma$e
Gangstas move in silence, bark like Rocweilers
These niggas ain’t bad boys they are simply Dylan
Talkin’ ‘bout them wildin’, run with MC violence
Pussy ass niggas, them snitchin’ at the trial and
Get a nigga 25 to life on Rikers Island
Smilin’, ‘til I run in his house and start firin’
Dead on a nigga, who pour blood in the river
Me not use for swimming, just to wash my Benji’s
Uh, Teflon Don, ain’t far from Jamaica
Just one of the greatest at this trade round makin’
Homie I spit fire, yeah cruise by Satan
In a ‘05 Aston Martin on gold Daytons
They say I ain’t hard as 50, I ain’t gon’ sell
If I don’t move a million units, I’mma end up in jail
Get real close to the speakers, I got a story to tell
I went from the front porch to the cover of XXL
I took one in the heart, I’m ready to die
And all this Hennesy’ll make a nigga crash the G5
Catch me at a stop sign, nigga I ain’t drunk
I’m gangsta, I pop mine, leave you eyein’ the pump
Tie your faggot ass up, let you die in the trunk

Do he ghost for P. Diddy? Can he write me a 16?
My mom’s told me 50 got problems out there
But I’m a son of a bitch, why the fuck should I care?
And anyhow, I got problems of my own
Like which D. Eagle to carry homie, gold or chrome?
Fuck it, stuff ‘em both in my dickies
Then game like Sebastian Telfare

We Will Survive,UnKnown,UnKnown,"We will survive, we've been through this too many times
My people are getting stronger they know that we on the rise
We will not live and let die
My niggas on the front line and we all here
Hold your head high
So many years, too many tears living this life
This a battle we gotta fight so put your war paint on
A lot of black men died over slavery, civil rights and apartheid
These are the hard times but we will survive
It all started 400 years ago, my people in chains
400 years later same bullshit y'all ain't changed
You got a jump shot or you rap or play ball
Then you can eat in Beverly hills and shop in they mall
Who really making calls like my people ain't determined enough
And in the hood they trying to terminate us
And turn us against each other
Got us fighting over colours, brothers
I thought the object was to love one another
We can't see past the 20 inch rims, bitches and hoes
40 bottles and frequent trips to the liquor store
So how do we raise our children
There's a new born soul every hour in America
This is not only there's but our America
The white man made it this way, we never asked for the slavery days
But we still paying for cotton t-shirts our ancestors picked that we hurt
But this is the rebirth
They say the black man will struggle as long as he continues to hustle
And pitch crack from a bucket, these motherf*ckers have no idea
They lock us in prison for years
And send us county checks to compensate us for our mothers tears
Too many taxes, every 12 checks another w2
President Bush's way to say f*ck you
Our day is coming we taking over
How you give us guns when 70% of all Kuwaiti soldiers
You gotta be stupid
Don't ever forget we were African rulers before NBA players and furniture movers
You burnt this I prove it
We don't want 40 acres no more, college funds and real estate
Keep the Grammy awards, your H2's, new watches we don't hate you watch us
Me and Marshall's like Hank Aaron and Babe Ruth
Opposite races still chasing the same dream
But when it boils down to everyday life who do I trust? ME!
I will not surrender this is not the ending
Turn my back in the dirt this is uncle Sam's curse
You got a hot verse you on MTV
You can dunk in the 8th grade you on NBC
Kids struggling to make grades in school
You run the rock like Barry Sanders in the tenth grade you getting paid at school
And all the old heads that paid their dues we don't respect that
Too worried about where the next Nike air checks at
News rims put on your lexus
He ain't registered to vote Al Gore loses the next election
One strike, two strikes, three strikes your gone
25 to life but still life moves on

Till We Meet Again,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Rest in peace to my motherf-ckin nephew Frogg
Niggas this fat rap nigga
Love nephew, see you when I get there
Meet me at the front door
R.I.P. Frogg

Livin on a day
Even though that I can’t touch you
It will never be the same
I will always love you
Only you’re so far away
Only you’re so far away
Only you’re so far away
I will always love you
Only you’re so far away

It’s a problem they don’t see the block
Block block soo woop til them heaters pop
Damn, my nigga dead in his grave and I can’t wear this chain no mo
It got me feelin like a slave so I gave it to his pops in his memory
Loadin up the Glock, takin shots of that Hennessey
Layin on this table, getting tatted
And don’t worry about who get it ‘cause we at em
That’s on the block
I know you standin next to Pac
Throwin up the west side, polo down to the socks
And I’m selfish cuz I want you here
But you gone so it’s chronic smoke in the air
And you know bad ass got a hot head
So it’s on til a motherfucker drop dead
And even though it won’t bring you back
I’m sippin on Rose clan, just me and my strap
Watching as the cars pass

Livin on a day
(Watching as the cars pass)
Even though that I can’t touch you
(Just watching as the cars pass)
It will never be the same
I will always love you
Only you’re so far away
Only you’re so far away
Only you’re so far away
I will always love you
Only you’re so far away

Swear to God I ain’t slept in 5 days thinkin bout the 7 kids that you left behind
While I’m swerving on this highway
Reminiscing bout the time I joked about your cap
And how you wore that polo hat
Handin off yo head, point it to the back
Same smile since you was 10
And King Frog had you on his shoulders
Yelling see the burnin through the trap
Time flies, now we chasin all these hood rats
West side, you a diamond rollin through the hood, up and down the block
Pocket full of cash, fresh J’s on the gas
Hop in the 1-10, meet the homies in the lot
Following this upper club and bout all the Ciroc
And remember when I bought your first bottle of sprays
Always down for yo niggas so you gave it to D Shade
So I brought a couple mo bottles, gold bottles
How a young seater becomes another’s role model
Til we meet again

Livin on a day
(Til we meet again)
Even though that I can’t touch you
(Til we meet again)
It will never be the same
I will always love you
Only you’re so far away
Only you’re so far away
Only you’re so far away
I will always love you
Only you’re so far away

I was holdin on
Your funeral is jumped up
Cemetery flamed out, all the homies burnt up
Tryin not to she'd a tear but I couldn’t hold it
Your daddy took it like a G and everybody know it
I told yo mama yesterday I got er and I do
As long as they printin money and I’m bangin pyroo
If one of the kids needs something, niggas comin through
They don’t just go for his, all the homie’s kids too
And look how them niggas did you
Homie stretched out, retaliation is sketched out
And we at it to the day’s end
Bustin on my enemies til it cave in
And to my brother face and my homie slim roo
You know I got this
And these going up, you got a hood full of riders
Laugh now, cry later, the sucker niggas that shut up
We part em, red see em using products
And then it’s on

Livin on a day
(And then it’s on)
Even though that I can’t touch you
(Til we meet again)
It will never be the same
I will always love you
Only you’re so far away
Only you’re so far away
Only you’re so far away
I will always love you
Only you’re so far away

Livin on a day
(And then it’s on)
Even though that I can’t touch you
(Til we meet again)
It will never be the same
I will always love you
Only you’re so far away
Only you’re so far away
Only you’re so far away
I will always love you

Died Too Soon,UnKnown,2004.0,"I don't do much, sit on the block in that lavendar Range
Waitin' for fiends, pass 'em the caine, y'all niggas is lame
Y'all don't really want beef with the Game
Give 'em a hundred thou, ease his pain
You don't ride through the 'hood, motherfucker that ain't your Navy 6
All you do is drive Jay-Z's shit
Nigga you ain't hardcore, nigga you ain't never won no awards
Only stood behind Dame when he was thankin' the lord
You a fag, nigga you know your rhymes ain't ill
And state property' the closest you ever been to a mill
You ain't hot with that wack ass album you dropped
The whole Roc know Beans came and took your spot
You a joke, tax write off for Russell and Hov
Why you think they keep you around when you only went gold
Whoo Kidd let him know who put the B-I in bitch, faggot
Couldn't sell a record with T.I. and Trick Daddy
Nigga talkin' that shit, I crush him
And this ain't got nothin' to do with Quik and Busta",https://genius.com/The-game-died-too-soon-lyrics
Business Never Personal,Untold Story: Volume II,2005.0,"Yo, when I'm out in Oakland, catch me in the silver and black Coupe
With two Desert Eagles and an ounce of glue
When I'm out in San Fran, the P.D. real nervous
Cause they know I'm packin heat under the Willie Mays jersey
Nigga, it ain't nuttin for me to empty a clip
Or wave my guns in the air and just enter ya strip
I know about gangs, had shootouts with plenty of Crips
I sold crack and been out of town with plenty of bricks
So ain't nuttin you can tell me, about the game
Come with beef and leave here without your brains
And I'ma drive upstate and try to bounce this 'caine
In that Shelby the same color as moutanin rain
And you know I got the South clickin
Cause ain't nuttin like niggas with gold teeth and them down South chickens
So fuck with my D and get found wit'cha mouth missin
This ain't about you and me it's about business nigga

It's business never personal, real live on blocks
If we ain't movin the rocks, then we movin the stocks
Cross a hustler motherfucker you'll arrive in a box
It's the true to life struggle 'til we arrive on top

They don't understand me, like the Birdman I got candy
Put the herb in, I got family
I'm doin 85, in the 50-mile-an-hour lane
Tryin to handle my business, the Figgaro stack change
Independent tycoons (tycoons) - yeah
My niggas puff trees, snort coke and chew shrooms
Bad to the bone (to the bone)
And cain't trust a nigga for shit cause Feds on the phone
My whole crew dirty, fuckin with amphetamines
Catch you slippin blow your whole crew to smitharines
Now the streets knowin (knowin)
And I'ma run this shit back with my foot broke like Terrell Owens
Still blowin
Like Mike Jones of the Swishahouse, gold knock them bitches outs
We take trips out to Houston and D.C
For the West coast, nigga can you feel me?",https://genius.com/The-game-business-never-personal-lyrics
Hate (feat. young buck & dj haze),UnKnown,UnKnown,"Ya, let's take em back, uh huh
Comin' up I was confused, my mommy kissin' a girl
Confusion occurs comin' up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around, probably out committin' felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing, 'Check, Check Out My Melody'
I wanna live good so, shit, I sell dope
Fo' a four finger ring, one of them gold ropes
Nana told me if I pass could get a sheep skin coat
If I can move a few packs and get the hat, now that'd be dope
Tossed and turned in my sleep that night
Woke up the next morning, niggas had stole my bike
Different day, same shit, ain't nothin' good in the hood
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gonna shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go ahead envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' nowhere so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gonna shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go ahead envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' nowhere so you can get to know me
On the grill of my lowrider
Guns on both sides right above the gold wires
I'll fo-five 'em, kill a nigga on my song, and really do it
That's the true meanin' of a ghost rider
Ten G's will take ya daughter out of Air Forces
Believe you me, homie, I know all 'bout losses
I'm from Compton, wear the wrong colors, be cautious
One phone call'll have ya body dumped in marshes
I stay strapped like car seats
Been bangin' since my lil' nigga Rob got killed for his Barkleys
That's ten years I told Pooh in ninety-five
I'll kill you if you try me for my Air Max 95s
Told Banks when I met him I'ma ride
And if I gotta die, I'd rather a homicide
I ain't have fifty cent when my Grandmomma died
Now I'm goin' back to Cali with my Jacob boy, see how time fly?
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gonna shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go ahead envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' nowhere so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gonna shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go ahead envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' nowhere so you can get to know me
From the beginnin' to the end, losers lose, winners win
This is real we ain't got to pretend
The cold world that we in is full of pressure and pain
Enough of me, nigga, now listen to Game
Used to see five-oh throw the crack by the bench
Now I'm fuckin' with five-oh, it's all startin' to make sense
My ma's happy, she ain't gotta pay the rent
And she got a red bow on that brand new Benz
Waitin' on shop money to lamp, sittin' in the Range
Thinkin' how they spent 30 million dollars on airplanes
When there's kids starvin'
'Pac is gone and Brenda still throwin' babies in the garbage
I wanna know 'What's Goin' On' like I hear Marvin
No schoolbooks, they used that wood to build coffins
Whenever I'm in the booth and I get exhausted
I think what if Marie Bank had got that abortion? I love you, ma
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gonna shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go ahead envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' nowhere so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gonna shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go ahead envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' nowhere so you can get to know me",https://genius.com/The-game-hate-feat-young-buck-and-dj-haze-lyrics

When them hollow tips crush them bones
When i call 50, BANKS && YOUNG BUCK is on
They bringing heavy artillery
When I chirp that phone
Grew up with the holy ghost
Went to church from home
Badboy since birth like justin combs
Been to the county jail once, it ain't feel like home
Promised to never go back if n****s left me alone
But the hood is the hood, n****s hate to see me get money

Nuthin’ But a Game Thang,Westside Story,2004.0,"Haha, the drama king motherfuckas'
Addicted to beef pt. 2, The Game is in New York in Converse, Ha

Come to Cali get jumped in the gang
If you ain't a crip like Snoop or a blood like Game
Niggas'll run upon you and snatch your chain
Leave you on the ground leakin' that purple rain
'Cause you fuckin' with the Compton hoodrats
If you blowin' out her back and back in she unloadin' a clip out your ratchet, that's how it happen tell Carmelo
For the right price I'll get his drink embezzled
And send her back to Denver, all I want in return
Is to autograph Andre Miller, that's gangster 45 stainless
Me?! I ain't ever gotta' tuck my chain in
You want beef I'll show you what pain is
You ain't gotta ask Marshall Mathers what my name is
Come to Compton I'll show you where the 'caine is
Got up to 9-5 since Buck came in
Cops come I'mma dash like Damon
'Till these S dots start makin' my feet hurt
Then put a million in the Nikes that LeBron wear
And they need work should've came with a T-shirt
G-Unit hogtied, niggas feed first
While your bitch suckin' Tony Yayo 'till her knees hurt
You better suck him like he just came home
Then he went back in, then he just came home
And the beef won't be a day long
'Cause I'll put 5 niggas in place like an NBA zone
And you can shoot your way out or pull a K out
But when the smoke clear everybody laid out
At the scene, then slide of in a six-trey Impala dragon green
If I crash that I'mma' paint the wagon cream
So I can put that in Lowrider Magazine
If I don't win I'm takin' jewelry, pattin' jeans
I don't care if you 7 foot with packing Gs
I got a full black jacket thing and a black magazine
So don't make my ratchet sing
Unless you feel like doin' your casket thing
In the church where it might hear around a Jackson theme
In Compton it got average fiends, we got the ones
That run in your house and kill you for a plasma screen
They'll do anything to put the rock in the antenna
Have you spittin' to O-Boy like Juelz Santana
I dipped in your set, red bandana
With a bitch from Harlem that only speak spanish
But she know what the plan is
 and back to her man crib
She got ass like she from Atlanta
Fuck her brains out then slide on my G6 canvas
Like I play softball, pitch rock underhanded
Dre made it happen now I'm G-Unit branded, bitch

Yeah motherfucka'
First nigga on the West Coast that holds two mixtapes
On the East Coast back to back motherfuckas', suck my dick
Ain't nothin of y'all can do to stop (the City of Compton), hahaha
Yeah motherfuckas', I'm in New York like a Yankee fitter
Somebody call the N.Y.P.D
Send that boy back to Cali 'fore I fuck somebody up

Like, how many niggas can write without writing?
Shit, I got to be in the top five already
Game
Game
I'm not new to this shit, homie I been in it
Six years dying to be heard by the masters
I'm not too hot to drop in ten minutes
Pac' was the shit, but I'm fine being classic
Need more time to dispense my thoughts out
Intense as it sounds, rap relieves stress
So every bar delivered was a mental thought
Amazing, shit like a burden off my chest
B16 is a
,
Doc' is a beat playing through the g-force
Understand the volume of the studio sessions
Walking, talking, block of C4
Might explode on the next nigga pressing my buttons
Keep pressing ya luck, go on, try it again
Have you wake up in the ER, counting your blessings
Confessions of a desperate man, dying to win
Trying to walk the right way, gotta steal the past
So hard to be righteous when I feel them laugh
Cause when the bomb blow you gonna fell the blast
Confessions of a desperate man, dying to pass
Niggas sleep in the hood, sleep with medals
Sleep with heat or with a shank
But the truth, protect me over they drama
I keep it hood, keep it ghetto, keep it street, keep it gangster
And the youth, respect me more than they momma
Cause I'm soldier for the cause in the army of the Christ
I'm here to let ya'll know man he not some nice fag
I know I got flaws, but whatever my vice
Still my motto is ""I ain't got no price tag""
All I thought was the worst, burnt out from oppression
From seeing my people being killed by America
But what I thought was a curse, turned out to be a blessing
Cause all ya'll Europeans did was build my character
I'm trying to purify it in the furnace of affliction
Tired of hearing my peoples cries from your lashes
So I ride with a heart burning with conviction
It's the fire you're fearing, it's the phoenix rising from the ashes
Trying to walk the right way, gotta steal the past
So hard to be righteous when I feel them laugh
Cause when the bomb blow you gonna fell the blast
Confessions of a desperate man, dying to pass
Hurricane
Niggas politicking, wanna know why I'm rhyming different
My best friend got murdered, homie, my mind is different
If you ain't never spent no time in prison, you can't understand these bars of the lines I'm spitting
Niggas riling me up, let's go, find a victor
I can't do it homie that's the reason Shyne in prison
Through divine intervention, ten plus years doing crime in the trenches
Multiplied by the time we spent in the kitchen
That's a life worth of hard living, Cuban cigar tipping
Twelfth grade bitching, purple swerve by the jar sipping
If you lost a homie you know friendship is god given
I done seen the church so much you'd think I was born Christian
I done seen more dead bodies than a mortician
Seen niggas in and out of county blues like they was born crippin
So I'm a keep on living cause when you gone niggas ain't gonna do shit but f*ck your bitch and pour liquor, this ones for my niggas
All my homeboys who died in the struggle
And all my niggas still alive
Be what you are, and say what you feel, cause those who matter, don't mind, and those who mind, don't matter

Yeah yeah, you keep a nigga flodded man just wait 'till I touch down, I'm gonna be on some shit
You been writin' in there?
Little bit, know what I'm sayin' -- on the walls and shit
Couple bars here couple bars there, been fightin' and shit
You got something I could listen to real quick?
Shit, g-yeah. Check it

Most of these rap niggas be fakin', I'm talkin' the throne chases
I diss 'em on any basis, throw Patrón shots to my face and
Stay blunted like jamaicans, the Marleys puffin'  the finest cheefa
Fuckin' the finest divas, if I have it  I'd like to meet 'cha
Show you how I light the streets up, kill niggas that never speak up
You my fans, sit in the stands and watch me rip these beats up
Like a legend, feel my presence like the dead ones
If I die, my only wish is my face on some Air-1s (Okay, okay, okay)
My soul's curled, my baby mommas they drive 6s
As for my bitches there's other rappers out there that's trickin'
My only mission was to sell a couple records
Buy a Bentley and drive reckless, a big medallion on my necklace
I 'seen Kane and Rakim do it, so much respect here
Hip Hop is dead because you new niggas dont get the message
I used to call names out, you niggas dont deserve it
So lame out, die from these bullets 'outta Game's mouth (ooh)
[Interlude: Game & 
Young Rob
]
Yeah I've been here flexin' my shit nigga I told you
Yeah I see your shit's on fire, nigga I know you got some more shit I can listen to
Shit, hell yeah check it

My flow polished, I studied the legends
Hip-Hop scholar kick knowledge get dollaz'
You got some work then holla
I'm on the block pitchin', most of us got riches
Not trippin' work hydraulics and fuck the hot bitches
Youngins dont stop wishin', if you got a block then flip it
Just because I'm a blood don't mean my niggas should stop crippin'
We from the ghetto, we came up without a pot to piss in
We gettin' money stayin' blunted cause' the clock is tickin'
You got a rock then pitch it, you got a Glock then lift it
Them G-Unot t-shirts make them niggas stop snitchin'
Forever ballin' I'm Jim Jones with rims
On that blue Aston Martin interior like my skin tone
Most of these rappers want me dead, shit I been gone
Too classic, move rapid, my jewels the blackest
The first 8 letters and everything that I stand for
Colder than a New York block, shut the damn door
[Interlude: Game & 
Young Rob
]
Changed up your style up this shit, ooh-ee
Had to give the East coast niggas somethin' man
You know I be on my motherfuckin' gangsta shit
Sometimes I just gotta' spaz out
Man, damn I can't wait 'till you're home, boy
You know man, it's like, it's just another year and half
I'll be good man. Need some pussy though, that's the main shit
Pussy and Patron

Niggas calling me back for an Encore like I'm Eminem
I disappear niggas like spinnin' rims who the fuck wanna war
Meet us at in the corner store, call it the hot spot
Where gangbangers throw hot rocks the boys coming So what
They pop cops, push them hot drops Hop out with them shirts on
And say we got rocks High-school drop outs
They're there to air the block out, stack paper like the OGs told us
(Ey come on my nigga I gotta go, gotta go)
We only chirp on Nextels don't talk on them Motorolas
Gotta' feel that 
(I gotta go pick up Brandy man, Chuck)
So kick back and listen to what I'm saying, picture me parleying

All I Know (Q.B. 2 Compton),UnKnown,UnKnown,"Live now, die later, flood or clock the shit out of haters
Got niggas tryin to ""Kiss the Game Goodbye"" like Jada
Get your shit pushed back like Jada's CD
I'll put your brains on that Kenwood TV
So you can see hell in 3D, it's right there dog
And the Game behind the Desert is a nightmare dog
If it's pussy, I might share it dog, beef I'm right here dog
I'm on the block, white Nike Airs on
Gucci check, Coogi sweat, they wanna know
If 22's on the truck, give me coochie yet
But I come through in the new GS with two, three tecs
Got niggas Harlem Shakin like the new G. Dep
Tryin to read my whole script, but ain't seen the movie yet
Better have that Glock stuffed tonight
I'm comin through with Young Noble, and we, gon', make, it
A block bust tonight

Getting American Money Easy, all I know
The Gangsta All Motherfuckers Envy, all my dough
It's a West coast knot, watch, let it bang out
Shots range out, for all the gangsta hangouts

Lace your tips, polish your gators, we like odds in Vegas
You can't ball? Then it's probably the haters
Can't breathe then it's probably the Desert, if you a gangsta or not
I give a fuck dog, bullets is hot
And every nigga gon' cry when he hit, the more pain
The more blood drain, he ain't survivin shit
And your niggas ain't gon' ride for shit, they know
If they came through everybody in the X-5 is hit
Red rag or blue rag, niggas die for this
The Game the reason all these niggas on that ""Cali Love"" shit
Compton niggas get grimy too, pull you out of that 6
Fuck you up like one time'll do
And I dare y'all to stop on the 'Shaw, and King Boulevard
Comin hard, Doogie Howser pullin bullets out your jaw
Turn your round trip into a one-way ticket
You can visit, but you can not lie and kick it


Aiyyo, we left a stain on your block, you came with a cop
Pointin fingers at them niggas, that kept shit hot
Next to 'Pac, I'm the hottest thang out, homey we can bang out
Outlaw air it out, box 'em in, square it out
Learn about your whereabouts and we right there
Me and Game have you left right there
N-O-B-L-E, O-U-T-L-A-W-Z
We bubble with ease, and I double my cheese
I got niggas out in Compton that'll find yo' ass
I got niggas out in Jersey, that'll hide yo' ass
For a long time if you ever fuckin with mine
It's a thin line dog between the real and the fraud
We killin your squad, my homeboy still in the yard
You the type of motherfucker standin next to the God
The Game is deep, you motherfuckers ain't the streets

Brushed off my G6s hopped in the G-Wagon
Roll through the city of Gs

On the east side niggas bangin' Cs
And holla' Black Wall Street 'till Shyne is free
The ‘hood ain’t the same now, bitches wanna holla’
Trae riding shotgun in a cherry Impala
Chrome hydraulics the beats is knockin'
West coast we keep it rockin' if there's drama we poppin'
It’s 1-8-7 when I bang that Manurhin
Spin yo' ass around like that chain Ma$e be wearin'

Give me a pen a couple stacks and Imma bless you my nigga

I've been wicked since '97 the G without the pay
I've been street before niggas started, my brother what's the play
In the rental with CDs and a torpedo full of K gauge off
What it is me and Paul got the rest stressed

Underdog up in the game with a G-mindframe
I had ambition of a dope fiend searchin' for a fix
I was in the streets grindin' tryin' to get in the mix
All odds have been against me ever since day one
But still I worked overtime 'til the job was done
A couple of my partners died some of 'em got tried
Now they doin' fed time, a 20 year ride
Write a letter here near, shootin' kites to the yard
'Til my rounds I'm countin' on that he'll go in hard
Most of my partners turned against me when the road got rough
I used to paint with deep prayers, pints of purple stuff
Then reattend you feel me, but the fake still hate
I'm just tryin' to feed my family put food on the plate
So I patiently wait, bringin' pain and stackin' paper
Mind focused on my hustle, fuck a hater bitch I'm Paul Wall

Yo, yo
I'm tucked on the border line
Where I'm picturing stones
I hit the switch, and watch them bitches be gone
Get it right figga, I'm in my rear view
Cause the streets can hear you
Bright moon to steer you, it's gotta be wild
Get in position cause the streets you'll find
Matter of fact I'm on a detail grind
Without no female lies, me and my team move
Ice like snow storms, the price gets
Tighter than vise grips, cause game is priceless
Jammed up with ice picks no way you can write this
Seven on the dices, the way that I like shit
Catch me in the background holding the mac now
You never back down bitch you better back down

Look in my eyes nigga tell me what you see
This right here, it's for the books like Frasier and Ali
Strap in your belt cause we're taking the ride
Through this concrete jungle where you scratch to survive
Ya gotta, play by the rules cause the wolves is lurkin
Night time the streets is quiet, but them wolves is workin
You can slip if you want, that's when ya know it's real
Back against the wall, that's when ya blow the steel

Hey yo I spit that crack, hit you with a freebie
After that, bet you keep coming back to see me
See me, now picture that
When I'm better than any other chick that rap
Ya'll acting like I ain't never picked up the bat
Or picked up a mac, and make a bitch shit in her slacks
So try chill and relax, till I little spaz
I done filpped chicks for just trying to give me a dap
But since boy I take ya jewels, I ain't givin 'em back
And they can investigate me I ain't givin 'em jack
It's neither big I bang (?) for the streets strictly
That's why everywhere I go I got beef in the east with me
Give me ya leaf and the piece is sticky, don't try nothing tricky
I punch you in ya neck go tell ya moms to hit me
Custom made khaki's, no Im not sticky
Who told ya'll chicks you was fucking with me


Too many hutlers, and not enough customers
Shit on the hood, nobody gonna have no love for ya
Losing ya street cred on the real you can eat lead
And you don't want no problems, praying that the beef dead
Yo they brought me back to strangle the mood
The little and Slick Rick neck dangling gold
I ain't home but few times a day I be changing my clothes
I want this next generation to know
When rap suck, you brought it back to the essence
So sit back and really think before you ask any questions
Got this game in the cobra clutch cowards ya'll know what's up
And ya shook what's on this earth I seen so much stuff
I used to roll with Russ, the doors opened up
Doing big big things like making clothes and stuff
Street master mind, ya'll talking asinine
And I ain't have no choice my nigga I had to grind
I'm known for making moves, labels be baking fools
Everything is fixed, it's like people get paid to lose
A few occasions my neighbourhood do it major news
Ya boy got more flavor than Jamican food


Let's slow the process elimination
My niggas out for that mighty Dollar, What you chasing?
I done been where you trying to go and back again
I done seen niggas bang they own niggas
And believe me not an accident, so you think I give a fuck
What you say, how you feel
My niggas never tell shit, but a coward will
I used to yap about the Maybach
A real nigga in this industry is like a needle in the hay stack
Fresh deodors, what we got before us
Suckers think they flow sick mind is rigor mortis
I don't know who the fuck ya playing with
Price on ya head could be that bitch ya laying with

Handle my jewels with the cuff in my shoes
Avi jacket on my elbow, fifty coast the jewels

So cover my face, and run up in the place

Eighty karats on my pinky and rang
Crews buzz when you speaking my name, cause I'm deep in the game
With top cool thangs and million dollar planes

Now we soaring through the spacious skies
Strap yo' body with them K's and ride, the handle is up

K.G.'s away Jersey blowin' chronic that green
Gave up the hoop dreams, bubble with the crack dreams
Turn hood zombies into an Olympic track team
Till I got got shot and infiltrated the rap scene
Had to clear my life up, Doc. gave me the vaccine
Don't get it twisted, I still click clack things
Red beam attached to each and every strap
That I keep locked up in my basement
If I shoot a nigga will I be known
For gettin' Jason, I don't know
Still got a sick phase for shoot outs and car chases

And I got some kisses from a couple Brooklyn bitches

Ain't nothing my nigga, tryna get paid in full man

No question I'm rep'n Vatican, we gone do this big nigga style
Let's take em there for real, let's go
[Verse: Raekwon)
Before flusty days living in Killa Hills
I was young'd out with rusty waves
Cut'n hair chill'n, going down town blaze'n
Lay'n up in Albee Square, When I bought my first fronts there
Everybody young as fuck, in the pizza shop, what up
Brooklyn niggas rap with a cuffle
Call the highlights the gangsta dialect
Before I let any nigga take mine I'm die'n, Moet
What's the jump off, the new shit
Then he said hold up a sec
Get this crack money, niggas except
Wick checks, food stamps and amps
Blue Wallabee's, aviaries' on in the back on the ramp
You know we pop off for hours, cowards beware
Word to mother, you will respect my power
Respect the dollar, no quizzy, Get busy
It was like adolescents at war, we clapped them thizzies
On the duece suited Voltron, The ratchet heavy
In the crib cool'n blunted, watch'n Tom & Jerry
Bag'n up, laugh'n, bling'n, rhyme'n and sing'n
When it come to getting currency, call me a swinger
We rock Maybach's, Benz's is little
Icicles on, cover the ground with a massive dribble
Call us ballers, brawlers, them whores want all us
Suede down, cool'n, play'n spades with quarters
And then left it for the rap game
All my niggas grab champagne
Bust of them seals it's mad flames, yall lames
Stay in your lane, we move'n like big money
Bet a nigga die for them chains
You know the slang baby, watch me lay her
Half goon, half mayor, the other half call me a hater
But later, I'ma polly for Rae-ah, and a hundred wolves
Pull next time, respect the playa, What
(Chorus x2: Raekwon)
Flashbacks, memories, two shots of Hennessy
Street life etiquette, real niggas blend with me
Talking bout ten a key, Baltimore, Tennessee
I ain't got to tell you, how long I been a G

I'm sick and that drop Aston is the medicine
Ride'n with the moon in the rear view, it's only evident
I'm fly as the wings on a seven forty-seven jet
Game code his rhymes, ain't even been recorded yet
On the fence where my father used to sport a Vet
And my Uncle Red ran the rock like door set
Rewind time ten years before I had the Lex
Mail man scared to drop the bills on my door step
Little nigga street dream'n bout a fast car
My Father had dope tracks like his arm was Nascar
In eighty-seven, shit I was maybe seven
Watch'n my big brother throw'n ten, come back with eleven
Only knew what it was cause I overheard
My pops on the phone talking bout selling all my birds
I cried over the next eight years over them pigeons
To only find out not one was missing, Word

Flashbacks, memories, two shots of Hennessy
Street life etiquette, real niggas blend with me
Talking bout ten a key, Baltimore, Tennessee
I ain't got to tell you, how long I been a G

Yeah, that's how we do what we do, you know what I'm sayin?
For real, the only thing we do baby

Born And Raised In Compton (Raised As A G),UnKnown,UnKnown,"Aight
Now everybody wanna know the truth about a nigga named Game
I come from the hub and every ghetto ain't the same
A lot of people already know exactly where it's at
Cause it's the home of the jackers and the crack {*whispered* - Compton}
Yeah that's the name of my hometown
I'm goin down, in the town, where my name is all around
And niggas just be hatin and shit, that's a pity
But I ain't doin nuttin but claimin my city
See my lyrics are double or nothin provin to suckers I can throw 'em
Pass the natural 10 to 4 and six-eight before I go
Not really into freestylin, or tryin to promote violence
But they gotta know about the five-five-fo', so
And that's how I'm livin, I do as I please B
A young gangsta put in work on these Cali streets
And everybody knows that you gotta be stompin
If you're born and raised in Compton

{*quiet scratching: ""Born and raised in Compton""*}

Nowww Compton is a place, where all my niggas chill dog
'til I found out, the streets get real dog
'Bout a year ago, somebody musta wanted me to die
Cause they kicked in the door, and gave the young kid five
They musta thought that I was gon' play the bitch role
Cause I lived through fo' five six holes
But I ain't goin out like no faggot-ass clown
They found, they couldn't keep a gangsta nigga down
So here's the burner in your face motherfucker silly sucker
Ass clucker now you're duckin cause you can't stop a Y.G
Gangsta, cause I'm true to my game
You're lame, and thangs ain't gon' never be the same
Cause a nigga like the Game is takin over
I really don't think I should have to explain
Oh yeah I'm a dog but my name ain't Rover
And I'm the kinda nigga that's feelin no pain
Sometimes I have to wear a bulletproof vest
Because I got the C-P-T style written across my chest
A gangsta motherfucker never ceasin to impress
My name is young Game so you can fuck, the rest
I'm comin like this and I'm comin directly
Cause niggas gettin all stirred up, I'm doin damage quite effectively
Rhymin is a battlezone and niggas can't win
Cause I'm a gangsta from the C-O-M-P-T-O-N",https://genius.com/The-game-born-and-raised-in-compton-raised-as-a-g-lyrics

Raised in the green light I'm a go getter
Wrote letter to the money till it came back
And I saw working out no jumping chats
A lot of shit upon my mind that's why I need the flush
I love life but they'll say she got a crush
I never sleep stay awake won't miss a thang
Dream with my eyes open I can see the change
Looking for a speed ahead you can never stop me

Lookin At You [Explicit],UnKnown,UnKnown,"Walkin' down the street in my All Stars
In my khaki suit, doin' what I do
Walkin' down the street, smokin' chronic
In my black locs, lookin' at you
Guess who's back on the West Coast tracks?
It's the motherfuckin' messiah of gangsta rap
Still dip in the six fo', still puffin' on the same chronic
Haters mad 'cause I still got it
I never fall off, even without the Doc
You niggas sellin' your soul tryin' to stay on top
Bitch nigga, check your Kotex
You niggas ain't movin' shit like the hand on a fake-ass Rolex
I'm five million sold, the cover of my last album
The only time you see me sittin' on gold
I'm the most anticipated, most celebrated
Most loved and the motherfuckin' most hated
Keep rollin' like gold Daytons
Niggas got the game fucked up like Hennessey with a Coke chaser
You gotta deal with me, I'm the West Coast savior
Niggas think of me every time they six fo' scraper
What do you call a nigga who's overbearin'
Belligerent, foul, defiant and very disrespectful?
You call that nigga the Doctor's Advocate
He's a reflection of Dr. Dre in his hay day in the worst way
The five star surgeon general
Took Jayceon to the Aftermath Research Department
And gave him a blood test
It came back 'G A M E Positive'
The nigga's infected with the game virus
His oratorical skills are so impeccable
That niggas in the streets call him Cyrus
The young don who is down with violence
'Cause in his heart, he's a tyrant
It's not a game, it's just called The Game
There'll be no referees, no half time reports
When the game is over, The Game is over
You can't put a quarter in the machine
And get three mo' min', that's the end
I'll walkin' down the street in my All Stars
In my khaki suit, doin' what I do
Walkin' down the street, smokin' chronic
In my black locs, lookin' at you
I done been to Hell and back
Left for dead, you know who to thank for that
Finished my second LP without a Dr. Dre track
You can take my soul but can't take my plaques
I'm the motherfuckin' snare when it touch the beat
I'm the 808 drum that got you movin' your feet
I'm the heir to the throne after the D R E
Product of my environment
You old-ass niggas get ready for your early retirement
Before I let hip hop burn down
I run in the building like a fireman
Who can out spit me when I'm high off sticky?
Throwin' back Patron shots in some creased up Dickies
I'm D.O.C. certified, Ice Cube 'Lynch'd' me
Snoop stamped me and the good Doc handpicked me
You still with me? Me and my mic
Can't be separated like Interscope and hahahaha

Fuck bitches at our leisure
Stuff dick inside they throat til they have seizures
Hoes down, B's up
Roll the trees up, Smokey Robinson
Start trippin, I like his jewelry, then I'm robbin son
Fuck a platinum plaque nigga hood with it
Bouncin that impala down the shore like what's good with it?
I'm a made man, I wear J's and
I been around more rocks than a fuckin cave man
I done sold it and bagged it
I done drove it and crashed it
Fucked my credit up smashin the Aston
FYI nigga I got a magnum
Only time I been punked was by Ashton Kutcher
I'm a motherfuckin butcher
Leave me around anything white and I'm a cook it
I be all up in the kitchin
No need for an apron, playboy
I'm a professional, I'm cakin playboy

Dismantle any MC for free, you been warned god

Impala sittin clean like it took 5 showers

Can't stop smokin but I'm down to a blunt a day
Yay, I mean yayo

We come through chargin nigga like San Diego
Seventeen chargers, couple of em same color but the shit is ok though
Cause all my niggas on the payroll get caught slippin, get a halo
And I ain't talking bout the x-box
Niggas let the tech knock
Welcome to the real life Black Ops
Where it's still fuck the police, white and black cop
And we ain't killin Jonny, no
Nigga give em an ass shot
Put him on injured reserve
Tie my number twelves up and then I give him the bird, word
That's how I get down, all you rap niggas floppin
Who talkin shit now? only Drake and Ye worth coppin
I take a hiatus, spend a little time gamblin in Vegas
Come back to back runnin faster than five Lakers
So mother fuck a hater and his family
About to finish the R.E.D. album up in Miami
Lebron can't stand me, cause I got this purp in my cup
24s on the truck, Laker game nigga what?
Ballin, Jim Jones voice probably with the Byrd Gang
See the chrome boy, them my mother fuckin home boys
But I'm from Cali not to be confused with Khaled
He say that we the best but I'm the best that's valid
And before you try to say that that's a diss
I was at Khaled's house two days ago bitch
Sippin on a Long Island ice tea with a white bitch
That was just as bad as Ice-T's, but she's not the wifey
The wife be at home with the kid's
Look at them and see how a motherfucker live

Changed the game, three shots parade ya Range
Hit the passenger, driver, old man on a cane
I'm a shell in the chamber, waitin to pop
Like Stoudamire on the court I'm used to movin the rock
Cruise in the drop, 740, snub in the box
My attitude shifty, never callin the cops
A Green Bay jersey, out on Bennett puffin hershey
D's on the route tryin to catch a nigga dirty
Respect the flow, better yet respect the dough
He get respect like rich and po'
Fuck a 9 to 5, I'd rather wake up and spit bars
And your wife, known to make my dick hard
Cartier lenses, 22's on my Benz's
When shit break out, y'all hit the fences

We stay bent, laid back behind tint, puffin sticks, spliff up
We are the hustlers everyone's talkin about
Big belt, flossy shades, paint on glaze, nigga
We are the hustlers everyone's talkin about
Unidentifiable straps makin heat clap sicker
We are the hustlers everyone's talkin about
We about reliable scratch and gettin this math quicker
We are the hustlers everyone's talkin about

Shit I might as well be duels, cause they call me the Flowmaster
I keep ridin tracks like a natural disaster
You know I'm 'bout macra{?} I'll clap ya, a pirate like {?}
Far from a Hollywood actor
A factor, focused on paper and cars
I move like crowds, stay minglin with the stars
I'm in the 6500 Benz truck with some broads
Dimes in every state I strike through be on me so hard
You know them Bentley bound, {?} down, wild Hummer chicks
That wanna take the car, cover up your tight summer shit
The game's heavy, man that's way off the charts
Heavier than killer whales at animal theme parks
You niggas is SweeTarts, my family is street sharks
We keep the ER busy tryin to revive the treat marks
Shit, we merk niggas like Eddie, get ready
We got heat that set car alarms off like M-80's


The Game on some regular rhymin, fuck all this new shit
When they gon' let real niggas get on that cruise ship
Black Sox and Dallas Squad got, chains and cars
Get, brains from stars after those awards
Miyagi's or doubles, don't think I won't buy out the bar
That's little shit, Mercedes dealership, buy out the cars
Sticker in the window, let 'em know that it's ours
Sittin on shit you ain't never seen like we got it from Mars
Game like Laker Will, snatch a bitch off your arm
She see Game covered in ice like I lived through a snowstorm
Plus I blow digits like my first name was {?}
Pay off security at clubs, get our guns admitted
Outside the club in the parkin lot, four dot six

Dawg, I'm just livin for the moment
I'm from Compton homey, but I'm like a center for Milwaukee
Cause I play for the Bucks, and I keep the 40 on me
Gotta keep the chrome-y, gotta keep my back to the wall
Wait for Q to rock me up, like cavi dawg
Speakin of lle', I put 8 in, 10 jump back hard
And watch my money come back, like Jordan in charge
I'm like the black Yankees, they don't want me around no more
Cause I hold the record for the most fiends roamin the boulevard
And when I'm on the boulevard, catch me behind the wheel
Of that new Escalade with the Foreman grill

Steppin out of Chevies with heat that's heavy - that's president
Bullets flyin for them dead guys - that's president
Led meltin inside your wig - that's president
20's 50's and 100's burnin - it's all president

Aiyyo I do this shit from Compton to the Mac block

So keep yourself in line or you could get smacked the fuck up
Jacked the fuck up, beat up bad and clapped the fuck up
Wrapped up in white sheets and threw in a white truck
Over presidents, now you willin to give your life up?
Put your kids on the line, and give your wife up?
Over presidents, they got you soulless
So take this bomb and hold this, while we control this
For the streets, we comin with heat that's stolen
And we hustle universal, for that paper that we foldin
Roll in 600's, Beemers and 'llacs
We a team of cats, with the pens and gats
That fiend for jacks, but only when the green's attached
We fiend for jacks, but only when the green's attached


It's Telly and young Game the hustler, ho juggler, coke smuggler
No matter what the hustle, dough doublin
Lle or the rock, give me a day and a spot
And I bet I'll come back with 10K in the drop

I'll stay in the spot, wearin a crop and coppin ounces
Telly Mac and Game the hustler, we rock the house
And plus we the reason that the blocks is out
So my words to the wise is just watch your mouth

And you don't want it when the stainless out, what the game about
The bullets is in, your brains is out
All over Frisco and Compton dawg, we ruthless
And the truth is y'all niggas can't stop us dawg

So why the fuck you wanna knock us off
Like we some high-powered cowards and y'all really the niggas that's soft
Still across the train tracks, we turn 'caine crack

Bet you pimpin in the block bringin me gifts furs and rocks

Show me the bud

Steady drinkin off
Takin her out
Pickin her up
Come up off in the club offerin love
And softenin up
Where you get that game from huh bruh?
You comin weak and can't be pimpin her on the daily and leavin the dubs
Baby know you a scrub
You gotta be more like the pimps in the industry
Much love to Eightball and MJG, Too-Short and Ice-T

Cause you a lame used to have game but xxxx done changed
Couldn't take the reign caught up by these busy dames
And I heard you let em' the 6 and the Range
If you can't mack don't attempt to
Cause all women ain't lame
Matter fact the hoes pimp too
Ms. Kane will xxxx around and pimp you
Coulda had control of her but they way you trick her she meant to
You the type of pimp that's strange yo'
Have your girl flip the script on you or beat you out yo' change dough

Blow your lil head off while you're tying your shoe
But back in the kitchen Pyrex's
Occupied by the twins bank robbers with large records hard vests
86 got guards on Benetton rugbies and frames that fake guns when they rob ????
To them that's natural actual play the ???? we gettin at you
And we don't want to rap to you
It's not Kosher
It's not a code of La Costra Nostra to roast ya I get a little closer
Rock you to sleep like I got these little bitches come over
Hoping you falll for the bait thinking you safe
Had that ass sweating like T.D. Jakes
I want the ones nigga you non believers you can ask your momma
Now thats drama
(Joell Ortiz)
Dollar icy from papi with the scraper Glock with the laser
Trying my best not to pop yet but the trop is major
Shot my lil cuz I do my aunt the favor watch this
I never been this itchy hope these cops just
Get a doughnut urge and just splurge you bot he nerve to play third
In a softball tournament round my way say that's your word you bird
I'll put your beak on a curb but anyway
Looks like a good game the pigs ain't leaving so I'm a lay
Nice play just too bad it's your last
Couple bundles of D and 200 cash to sack you in the grass
So watch the teams line up shake hands guess the games over
Faggot nigga hopped in a Liberty fake Range Rover
I'm on his tail like Sonic little shorty palming on a 40
Broad day I'm trying to dodge a cover story
Look like he stopping for gass I'm a pluck him yay
This had to be his most unlucky lucky day
2 brothers come out of 7 Eleven in army wear and stand there
Acting like my tires need air
He closed the gas cap too many things going his way
So I just stashed that you probably think I'm bugging but hey
I know them games in Lindsay Park is every Sunday he ain't going nowhere
I went home switched gear went out and grabbed me a beer
10 drinks later I'm at Burger King window for a Whopper
Look left and see partner I hit the stash blokka
(Game)
Who the fuck you think you is Ron O'Neal?
Tat tat what the fuck when that 9 milli peel
Is it real realer than Pitssburgh steel
Yo Ghost pass the toast these niggas is daffodils
Got buck naked bitches counting half a mil gloves on
Fully dressed bitches watching them with they snubs on
While I'm in the kitchen pretending to be Raekwon
Watching Rachel Ray all day I get my cake on
Fiends love me like a Drake song
Rep that Louboutin bottom in my back pocket all day long
Black Wall Mafias Wu-Tang Sopranos
Niggas steady pushing keys but we don't see pianos
Niggas steady pushing Phantoms we don't see the opera
Niggas steady rocking dreads you ain't even Rasta
Take your New Era off and reveal
The faggot nigga you are or your cap getting peeled
Then we out to Brazil I know niggas in Negril
That'd chop your fucking head off and throw it on a grill
Take the gold out your mouth and throw it in they grill
Send a finger to your moms and let her know that it's real
Nigga we in the field like Chris Johnson
It's 2010 how the fuck we get 6 Thompsons
Top 10 how the fuck you gonna forget Compton
Every rapper on your list'll get their shit stomped in
I started soowoo I'm the reasaon for that 5 shit
Came in the game on that fucking Ready to Die shit
Sold 9 mil ended up with some fly shit
Naked pictures R&B bitches all in my Sidekick
How I be killin the pussy should be a hate crime
Got a BlackBerry was getting too much FaceTime
Back to fucking project bitches now I hate dimes
All they want is money my nigga I can't waste mine

Let address this bitch ass nigga going on the Kendrick'
Said that album trash, nigga you full of gas
Poke holes in you, let you fill up the New-York cab'
Nigga in believes, all into his feeling
Cause he did 10 years for shootin at the ceiling
Diddi gave you a mill, lil nigga should’ve chilled
Cute curly side-burns talkin bout it real
Check my resume, any nigga want it - I bury him
But fuck this nigga, he can't get into America
I’m ‘bout to hit Brooklyn, fuck on his bitch Erica
Bust a nut, call a cabbie cut
After I tear it up and we just meditate
Gave it a pole, the day after election date
Bitches was on section 8, tryina get a section 8
Already came, this a rap like a ..
Hurricane Sandy got this bitch lights out
She fell asleep then a girl got piped out
It means the type hoes, NBA niggas wife out
And these my side bitches, nigga what your life 'bout
Mine's bout, gunz in the stash, the Chrys' piped out
That's 300C and Christ iced out
3 kids, all 3 closets Nike'd out
And I'm biopolar, see 40 block lights out
Word on the street – bitch niggas suing me
Sent the cops to my door nigga' how you a G?

Had to cock the 9, niggas tryin' to steal my bitch
Run out the back door, see them niggas hit the fence
I'm tellin' you, life ain't Compton, it's a bitch
Let off a couple shots, goddamn, I missed
Sayin' fuck it anyway, let off the whole clip
I'm not to be fucked with when I'm off liquor
Old English in my system 'bout to kill me a nigga
See, I remember back in the days, loadin' my A.K
Ridin' 'round in my Impala with my lungs full of haze
That's when I didn't give a fuck, now I got my sons
Shoot a nigga, he die, public enemy number one
But this ain't no action flick, no Johny Depp shit
When the TEC spit hollow tips in your Lexus
So, don't fuck with a Compton nigga
When he packin' a gat, yeah nigga, I stay strapped
Somethin' hot in here, nigga, it must be me
Somethin' hot in here, nigga, it must be me
Is it the shades? Is it the J's?
Is it the Bentley with the four colorways?
Or the old school sittin' on glaze?
What could it be?
It's 2 o'clock in the afternoon, I'm 'bout to roll a swisher
'Cause that's what real niggas do when they at home
Watchin' E.S.P.N. on a 70 inch flatscreen
K.G.'s away Jersey blowin' chronic that green
Gave up the hoop dreams, bubble with the crack dreams
Turn hood zombies into an Olympic track team
Till I got got shot and infiltrated the rap scene
Had to clear my life up, Doc. gave me the vaccine
Don't get it twisted, I still click clack things
Red beam attached to each and every strap
That I keep locked up in my basement
If I shoot a nigga will I be known
For gettin' Jason, I don't know
Still got a sick phase for shoot outs and car chases
Fuck Paccino 'cause we know niggas with scarred faces
And we go back like D-boys with small faces
And we crashin' them Ferraris like y'all hate me
Pharrell I think it's
Somethin' hot in here, nigga, it must be me

Niggas can't fuck with me, will stit
I guess I am a motha fuckin' legend, Will Smith
All I'm missin' is a bitch like Jaya, Bonnie and Clyde shit
Hit the fence like later, Syonara or we the dirt shit
Black rose phantom interior hurt shit
And I got some kisses from a couple Brooklyn bitches
Them hoes, they never testify, Beefs to Common
But Game keep it hood like Weez and top Rommy
Never stop comin' for the top
If it bakes a flesh wound if Feralla headshot
Motha fucka and when he take aim, bullets into your frame
My boss and allowed to when trigga swallow your vein
Can't walk through the club and take a piss
Without these new school rap niggas on my dick
Why you fuck around with you jewelry and all your wrist?
I pull up with your bitch pumpin' gangsta shit, now you know
Somethin' hot in here, nigga, it must be me
Somethin' hot in here, nigga, it must be me
Is it the shades? Is it the J's?
Is it the Bentley with the four colorways?

Justo Faison Tribute,UnKnown,UnKnown,"(Justo)
Word up, I be the one they call Justo if ya didn't know
Tryin' to check my man DJ Skee
With his new mix tape
Pick it up ya square
Ya heard what I'm sayin?
(Game)
It's another sad day in hip-hop
We lost another one of my brothers
Justo Faison
We love you
And we'll always miss you
Mix tape king
Forever...
We'll always love you Justo x4
(Verse 1)
I picked up my pen four years from the day
Never thought I'd be rappin, or even signed to Dre
I never been to New York, I had to find a way
So I dropped 40 bars on a clue mix tape
On a Birdman beat, then my name started buzzin
Aftermaths young gun and now everybody love him
I hooked up with Gavin, Foxy's lil brother
He took me to K Slay and Slay put me on the cover
Drama King I shoulda known, cause all of a sudden
Emcees callin' my name and I'm beefin' wit Joe Budden
That beef came and went, I got at him over Colours
Then caught him at Def Jam, found out it wasn't nothin
Look back at my career starin' out at the city
Thinkin' about the biddin' war between Dre and Diddy
If I was signed to bad boy, would 50 be on the math?
Probably not but maybe Justo wouldn't have crashed
(Hook)
We'll always love you Justo x4
(Verse 2)
I remember when Funk Flex first heard me flow
And Sway let me freestyle on the wakeup show
Spit over a 100 bars then Miss Jones started to host
That's when they started showing me love on the east coast
Then more people found out, I was with Dre
And at Bodega's I'm on 9 outta 10 of the mix tapes
I'm workin' on my album and the world can't wait
Cover of the vibe, and I ain't even have a release date
Then I met Justo he told me if I stay hungry
I'd go platinum and nobody can take that from me
He joked about my rap beefs, I thought it was funny
Gave him a pound then slid him 200 Bars and Runnin'
Went upstairs to change, got dinner at five
Went to Houstons and that's the first time I met Nas
Had billboard wit me and two months later he died
So this is what it sounds like when thugs cry
(Hook)
We'll always love you Justo x4
(Verse 3)
Markin' off days on the calendar I can't even sleep
Like a convict, waitin' on January 18th
When the documentary dropped, it flooded the streets
My mix tape buzz made me gold the first week
Double platinum in two months
Record labels gettin' scared
Cause the kid from Compton sellin like Sunny and Cher
Mix tape awards came around, glad I was there
To get my award, mix tape artist of the year
Stepped on stage, and Justo let 'em know
You might as well crown him the new king of the west coast
A couple of months passed and we ain't speak
My sidekick went off (Justo Rest In Peace)
I let everybody from Snoop to Busta know
A car crash just claimed the life of Justo
They say the good die young, if ya know like I know
Live ya life to the fullest one day we all gotta go
(Game)
Give a moment of silence
If you're wearing a Fiddy cap take it off
If you driving, pull over to the side of the road
We lost an underground legend

Mix tape king
Rest In Peace",https://genius.com/The-game-justo-faison-tribute-lyrics
Yesterday,UnKnown,2011.0,"In a world so cold, all we got is each other, so let's go
Thinking maybe you should stay a while, for the night
Girl, maybe you should stay a while, spend your life
'Cause I don't want to be alone
For all the women holding down they man
Let me see your hands if you understand

Every beginning has its end
And every rappers baby mamma has a Benz
So I say it's okay to have friends
Thank the haters 'cause without 'em you ain't shit
Take away the groupies, look at all the haters on my dick
When I sold five mil, all of a sudden I'm not real?
Hit a nigga with the steal now, I'm jeopardizing my deal
Can't please these haters, so I tease these haters
Keep 'em right where I can see 'em 'cause I need these haters
To hate on my wrist, to hate on my bitch
Said I wasn't hood five, so I gave 'em that six
Then I wrote that seven and I already ate
Ain't hungry no more, I got the nine, I'm straight

I never thought I'd be in this mansion
Or even getting out the ghetto
Growing up in Carson, California
A lot of homies ain't my friends no more
Now I been around the world
And I've been with a lot of girls
And, yeah, I drink 'til a nigga hurl 
(Hold on, my nigga)
Saturday wake up with a hang over
Two girls in my bed I don't know
Me and my guy, Brother Tyrant Davis
And  who ain't here no more
Rest in peace to all my dawgs
This one here's for all of y'all
I keep your picture on my wall
And memories of it all

In the club popping bottles with my homies, now they gone
Man, it feels like yesterday
Waking up two girls up in my bed
Saying let's do it again like yesterday
On the freeway swerving in my drop-top
Haters staring at it but you can't have it
Tonight we going in, the same thing tomorrow
And we gon' leave 'em talking 'bout yesterday

Every Sunday I'm at church with my daddy
Every Saturday I'm out drinking booze
Every Sunday I'm at work in Miami
On the yacht with a bottle of Cîroc
New York to L.A
Give a fuck what a hater say
I do it big, that's the only way
(Ay, ay ay, I just won't two-hundred thousand in Vegas)
When I turned sixteen, I got a drop-top Beamer
And a 4.6 Range Rove
At twenty-one, I had a all white Bentley
Twenty-five, I bought a black Lambo

Going eighty on the freeway (Eighty on the freeway)
Hundred on a bad day (Hundred on a bad day)
Cruising on a good day
I could say I did it all my way
[Chorus: Ray J & 
The Game
]
In the club popping bottles with my homies, now they gone
Man, it feels like yesterday
Waking up two girls up in my bed
Saying let's do it again like yesterday
On the freeway swerving in my drop-top
Haters staring at it but you can't have it
Tonight we going in, the same thing tomorrow
And we gon' leave 'em talking 'bout yesterday
Charles Louboutin, uh

Summer time, winter time, breakfast, dinner time
So far ahead of haters, meet me at the finish line
M.I.A., Chi-town, A.T.L, my town
Follow me on twitter but I can't be tied down
Far from a tug boat, I can't be pulled left, pulled right
Brown-skinned, yellow-bone, all types
Black Wall bandanna, black car, black Phantom
Say she used to fuck with Dre, I call her StatLanta
Compton, Hollywood, intrigued by the fast life
Good girl gone bad, Amber Rose last night
Sun come out, we dumb out, fuck them niggas talking 'bout?
Swagga on a hundred without pulling guns out
Without pulling cars out, bitches pulling they bras out
Without pulling cars out, niggas buying the malls out
Make them haters go blind, don't be Ray
No Jamie Foxx here but you can blame it on the spades

Mmm, yesterday
Yeah

That them big motherfuckers is twenty five

Deuce zeroes, I'm feelin' like the streets is mine
Mines hustle, mucho dinero, heat's confined
See more fall guys than Foreman-Ali combined
Any beef, I'm releasin' mine
And I won't stop bustin' 'til them Escalade seats recline
The kid roll with a greasy nine, come through and blast
I return shots like Arthur Ashe
You do the math, ten shots, ten dead bodies
Fuck bein' sorry, it ain't nuttin' but a gangsta party
And I'll make sure ain't a nigga survivin'
Shoot up the ambulance, make sure it ain't a nigga there to revive him

'Cause I weave through traffic in a roaster
But that don't stop the heater from bangin' or me comin' through
Droppin' all y'all niggas with three in the chamber
Keep two mac-10's when I'm rollin', one in the changer
One when I push the button's right next to the cupholder
Dog, we can get this shit over, I got ten on the Game
Let's say that Lee Harvey crack ya brain
Ain't gotta look over my shoulder, I'm good with the aim
Good with the handle and the bullet's good with the bloodstains
And the coroner's real good with the pickup
A1 good with the carpet cleanin', they can get the rest of that shit up
'Cause I kill like the hiccups, two at a time
Put you niggas next to each other how I do 'em in line
Real niggas stand up, hold they dick

I'm the type to pack a gat or few
Pull out and pop, simply 'cause I'm mad at you
Come through in a big boy, leave the bullshit at home
If beef cook, then I'm bringin' the chrome
If I die, then I'm leavin' a clone, but if I live
Through the drama one mo' time then them boys gotta dig
When I think about who shot me, I listen to Big
When I'm rhymin' on the road, I listen to Jig
Bump Nas off that purple, sittin' on the block
And when I'm loadin' up them clips, I listen to 'Pac
A semi with me like Eddie Murphy, got mo' guns
Than F A B O L O U S got jerseys
And you might get 'em all in the face when shit get thick
Make the back of your head look like Jerome Kearsey
And ain't nuttin' to do a drive-by in the hood
We ain't even got survival, but I'ma still take that ride
Bet my drink on it, bet my main squeeze mink on it
Think this shit a joke? Bet the S-5 pink on it

Confessions,Who Got Game?,2005.0,"Turn me up in the headphones a little
I want everybody to hear that shit

This is my confession, you can take time to listen
Or turn your back on me, but this is my confession
The life of a troubled child who grew up to be a gangsta
Look at me now

How the fuck would you feel? If you had to share every meal
Every night, with your foster brothers and sisters
I think about my mom and I missed her
Nights after watching the A-Team, when I kissed her
I use to want to be Mr. T, or Murdock
Which one was it? Uhh. then I heard shots
It must be coming from 133rd block
Where them West Side Piru niggas birds pop
And the Crips ain't far away
You got Nutty Blocc, Grape Street, and the PJs
Where niggas 15 years old with beers like Freeway
And you can die over he say and she say
Like ""your cousin told my brother's baby momma""
That Game done started that drama
In the projects, yeah the same ones that they said Carmelo got robbed at
But I talked to him, he said it didn't happen
Nigga you play ball, I'll be the rapper

(..give a fuck about these NBA ass niggas anyway
I ain't make it, I play ball, nigga I'm jealous nigga
You don't play for the Lakers anyway punk)

This is my confession, you can take time to listen
Or turn your back on me, but this is my confession
The life of a troubled child who grew up to be a gangsta
Look at me now

Sittin' inside 40/40 talkin' to JAY
Two and a half hours watchin' the Lakers and the Nicks play
He told me the same thing I heard Fif' say
Spit your heart out long as the shit pay
I was bangin' where the Bloods and the Crips stay
Dre found me and let me eat off his plate
I got full then I came back to feed my niggas
You no longer gotta bleed my niggas
Kill each other over jealousy and greed my niggas
God made it rain now water your seed my niggas
It's Black Wall Street you and me my niggas
Long as it's tatted on your skin you gon' be my niggas
Any drama you'll see my niggas b-l-double-o-d c-r-i-p my niggas
In the cemetery twice a week to see my niggas
Wishin' I could trade places and be my niggas

This is my confession, you can take time to listen
Or turn your back on me, but this is my confession
The life of a troubled child who grew up to be a gangsta
Look at me now

Wanted to fuck Brandy just as I start fuckin' with Q. Richardson
Word to my jumpshot I was sportin' that new Clippers shit
Picture this, I was a gangbanger
Now I'm rappin' with Lloyd Banks, Young Buck and 50 Cent
Think about it, would these hatin' ass niggas
Be bitchin' if they knew how to load a Glock and hit a fence
Fuck no I'm from Cedar Block, nigga fuck y'all
That Michael red Milwaukee Buck dog
Y'all never wanted to be an all star
Hatin' on him cause of the red lace and All Star's
That shit foul when I'm far from Ray Allen
Stay wildin', the only young gun with jake talents
I swear to god I can't wait for September
To dismember these niggas was hittin' at Jigga's
Fuck you scared of, of 'cause you hear buzz
Or 'cause he's from Compton the reason you feel blood
I've been cryin' so long when I'm sad my tears blood
Blood tears 'cause we lost the last 10 years
I came to get it back, load the clip with Dre tracks
The only thing that could stop me is if you bring JAY back

This is my confession, you can take time to listen
Or turn your back on me, but this is my confession
The life of a troubled child Who grew up to be a gangsta
Look at me now",https://genius.com/The-game-confessions-lyrics

Make The World Go Round,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Lace in Macy's don't have it
A hatred addict
I need faces mad with frowns
When I'm around
Or I'm wasting the fabric
I don't feel greater
To my plush pieces
'Cause you to suck your teeth
So mean-mugging on my clean-thugging
Mean nothing
Women dream I'm your husband
I'm Alex Pushkin
The black poetry-writing Russian
Ice disgusting
I started bling
How could you question my direction
Or my time for collection
Gangstas two-steppin'
You hate me
Should thank me
But lately
I burned so much trees
I keep environmentalists angry
I'm a rare dude, I'm a wonder
Your best success is my worst blunder
Y'all living trendy on pennies
I cop plenty Fendi
Vivienne Westwood, I'm good
Get the whole Trump Tower top floor for the hood
Dre & Cool, we riding heavy
And why to Miami? 'Cause . . 

(We make the world go round)
Now let's toast to the hustlers
(We make the world go round)
Tell the hustlers, toast to the gangstas
(We make the world go round)
Tell the gangstas, toast to the ballers
(We make the world go round)
And tell the ballers pour glass for all us
(We make the world go round)
I see you haters on the floor jockin' my swag
I'm popping Ralph Lauren tags
I'm pouring champagne inside a polo glass
Model bitches rollin' grass
Escabon folding cash
Toasting wit my entourage
Went for Robin Armitage
To all my stars
Red carpet to the Larmitage
We throwin' red dice
At the Mirage
I pull that red Lamborghini
Or twenties out my garage
Instead of shopping South Beach like and Terror Squad
We the Best! big pippin
Top down chrome spinnin
Top Gun Tom Cruise
Tucked inside my Gucci linen
Nope
Jess Romo you tryin' a shine
Up on with the nine
On your jersey for promo
Jessica Simpson that's so-so
Nick warner's (baby back)
Wit that lo so
Devil white
5-0 they catch me at the pro bowl on the field diamonds
Choking the jockey on my polo
CB let em know though

We make the world go round From my town to your town
We on top no stopping us now
We got patron to ballers two steppin
Ladies on the float and all in two steppin
From Malay to Harlem two stepping (echo)
So I' stop cause we made it where the ladies are
We start with Bellini's and end with Patron shots
H. Lorenzo belt buckle from Chrome Heart
A-life tag popper
It'd be sad not to walk out the store with bags
Worth a 100 cash, shopping
Balance only would have to
Have to swell you up
Before a pea snaps as you wet a vanilla dutch
Mets cap, that's Queens, I'm a vet
Bet that, 300 carats the average up on the neck, black
Paid the cost, be the boss, Black Caesar floss
Weekends at the Venetian, pull up in that black Porsche
Top down, new fashion
Seeing me is like seeing through the lens of Helmut Newton's camera
Light flashing
And I'm laughin'
My plaque's from album sales
Y'all is ringtone platinum
But .99 cents adds up
I don't hate 'em, I congratulate 'em

Diddy ain't tell ya'll I run the city now?
Play wack rappers like a stewardess, I sit 'em down
Take flight like Holyfield and Mike, number one or two
Lend me a ear I will chew you niggas like tobacco
Major League shit, get hotter than Tabasco
Make you eat shit
'Cause niggas can't see me, even with no tint
On the Bentley, I'm simply
A motherfuckin' magician when it come to dissapearin' rappers
Shit happens
Drama lead to bullshit, bullshit to foul play, foul play to gun play
Then you see the Tahoe swervin' down the one-way
Bangin' Big Poppa 'till the red dots spot ya
Pop ya, drop ya, like the Rasta-
Farian marijuana I blow like Sinatra
Better call a docta', I gotcha nigga

I'm number one (x4)

Who got you niggas gassed up?
Treat em' like a bitch, fuck 'em,  leave em' wit they ass up
Screamin' like K-Ci & JoJo's last cut
'If ya think ya lonely"", wait until tonight's up
Black tape around ya wife and your daughter
My lyrical slaughter's on time for your departure
Look what all that slick shit bought ya, this rap torture
Brought to you by your's finest, your highness
Drop to your knees, say your fuckin' prayers
Thou shalt not fuck with he who is greater
The emcee slayer, put niggas to sleep, have em' counting sheep
Get up in that ass real deep
Like a dildo, for real do', I let the steel blow
Get real low, I show you motherfuckers how it feel, so
You can watch me, kick shit like a steel toe
While you fall off the charts real slow

Put whoever at number two, fuck number three
Time to show 'em what them numbers do
Fist album five mil, second; four and a half
Subtract two quarters After the Math (I'm number one)
Like that Lil' Penny nigga
Play yo position, that go for any nigga
Big or tall, Bruce Bruce or a skinny nigga
Die fast, my nine milli is surgical
Give niggas gastric bypass when I murder yo
I WILL creep, dim the lights on the fuckin' Jeep
Gotta aim for his head cuz them bullets ain't cheap
If I load the Glock nine, count the bodys on the street
I was born hardcore: A Menace II Society
Caine and O-Dog in one, nigga I just begun
To break niggas o' they disrespectful habits

Walk In The Streets,BWS Radio 2,2007.0,"This is a DJ Haze Street Grind world premiere

I have come to the fork in the road
Many have tried to proceed from here, but they body go cold
Seeing souls flyin high from out the window in the Rove
It's a desert out here, California is a stove
360 degrees as the story is told
Pull the truck over to the side of the road, pull the brake up
Blow the horn before I get out, you niggas wake up
Hip-Hop been soft since the Roc-A-Fella break up
And I don't do subliminals, I just pick Jay up
And all you other niggas stay up (haha)
I got a lot to live for, fuck you think I had a kid for?
You gotta crawl before you walk
That's when you runnin' with the big dogs
Better slow down homie
Cuz when it go down homie
I ain't neva seen a one man army
But I done seen a lot of niggas bite when them hollows take flight
You wanna see a dead body, c'mon

Walk with me
Take one look inside my soul
And all that you will see is the ghetto
Ghetto (walk with me)
Walk, walk with me  (walk with me)
Through the ghetto, through the ghetto, through the ghetto

Take me up to the ?740? leave me understood
Oh yeah nigga I'm back in the hood
40 ounce spillin' on the sidewalk, eatin' away at the white chalk
Close to the project fence, far away from niggas that might talk
Every city I roam is home, I make the right call
10 minutes later, Latin Kings, Disciples, Vice Lords
Cuz niggas got me screwed up, like dippin' through the ninth ward
I might as well get a Cutlass on 28s and clean the whitewalls
That's too much drivin', let me get out and walk a little
Soak up game, listen to these Houston niggas talk a little
Must I remind you of that Ghetto Boy track
Your Mind is Playin Tricks on You, you'll neva go plat
Unless you can recite a whole Snoop Dogg track
I mean Gin And Juice, Deep Cover, or somethin' like that
Just cuz I'm from Compton don't mean I don't know Kool G Rap
I'm on a Road to Riches mothafucka

Walk with me
Take one look inside my soul
And all that you will see is the ghetto
Ghetto (walk with me)
Walk, walk with me
Through the ghetto, through the ghetto, through the ghetto

For me the first verse was just me talkin' out loud
Chronic and Louis the XIIIth, let me talk to my crowd
I'm cognac West, let me see what's behind that vest
Niggas is sleepin' on The Game, I put they mind at rest
I be talkin' to niggas dirty, every line's a mess
Cuz im from killa Cali, home o' gang signs and techs
I seen a lot of niggas get shot makin' that Compton pit stop
Niggas like me put it in a song and call it Hip-Hop
Don't repeat what I say, just peep what I say
Apply it to your life let me be the reason you pray
I got that Farrakhan flow, yeah I'm speakin' to millions
Slice right through the bean pod when I'm teachin' you children
Niggas get to flushin' they drugs when I creep through the buildin'
I will rain on you niggas till it leak through through your ceilin'
Imma hold it down, lord willin'
Remember the first time you heard Cube spit?
I'm bringin' back that feelin'

Walk with me
Take one look inside my soul
And all that you will see is the ghetto
Ghetto (walk with me)
Walk, walk with me
Through the ghetto, through the ghetto, through the ghetto

That's what the world wants, a girl cunt that talks about how much she wants to

Because it's cool, cause it's true, plus I want someone to fucking listen
And this is pretty much the only way you'll pay attention
Which is retarded if you think about it. But why think about it?
Why just knock it off your rock and fuckin' drink and shout out
What's wrong with the world so you can learn some shit you think is outlet
Slit your wrist to it, listen to Chris' music
Keep pumpin' your fuckin' fist to this bullshit
Piss on the flag that has nurtured you
Offend your rights, persecute, do some dumb shit
Loose on the run from the fuckin' law that shoot your guns at

Louis Vuiton house shoes somewhere on the road

Grave Yard,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Welcome to the graveyard
Where everybody like to pray: Allahu Akbar
You scared to say ""God?"" They call me Game because I play hard
So get your helmets and your face guards
I spit holy water, lets have a Face Off: Nicholas Cage
They say the boy is off the chain like two Pits in a cage
Your girl say my flow the bomb like I swallow grenades
Respect the rules up in this shit so you gotta get paid
Or you gotta get spayed like Windex with them twin Techs
I'll Raid on top of insects. Niggas die fuckin they family
Oh, where I'm from they call that ""incest""
Open the Bible, good book serves its purpose for shook crooks
Heavenly Father, I think we in Heaven, be a good look
Sing the hook:

In this heartless world that I live in
I have learned that I can't depend on love
It hasn't made me a Saint
So I'mma take it all with me to the graveyard

The cemetery ain't as new as the saint it look
They bury ministers there right next to straight crooks
And Nas told niggas they was shooting and they'd look
Niggas rhyme about banging, getting whooped on Facebook
Now put that on your wall, I put that on the wall
I shot-call and brawl quicker than Jon Wall
I'm killing these niggas, bought everything last year
And wasn't feeling these niggas. I mean I was numb last year
Wasn't feeling you niggas. Came back
To sell a few more mil on you niggas
Toast! I'm in the Phantom, nah nigga I ain't scared of no ghost
Cause all the dead rapper's albums are selling the most


Some say the 3rd verse puts niggas in a hearse
Since I was born Jay, guess I'm the Gift & The Curse
Lot of Bloods out here, but nigga I did it first
Still blood out here that's why I'm up in the church
Still repenting for my sins, but not all the way
Cause I just rode up in the Benz and handed homie the K
What he gon do with it? Probably run up on your crew with it
That's what I call rap beef, luckily I'm through with it
Now I just lean back, '72 with it
Sell it to a nigga down South, he act a fool with it

What do you call a *** who's overbearin'
Belligerent, foul, defiant and very disrespectful?
You call that *** the Doctor's Advocate
He's a reflection of Dr. Dre in his hay day in the worst way
The five star surgeon general
Took Jayceon to the Aftermath Research Department
And gave him a blood test
It came back 'G A M E Positive'
The n*** infected with the game virus
His oratorical skills are so impeccable
That *** in the streets call him Cyrus
The young don who is down with violence
'Cause in his heart, he's a tyrant
It's not a game, it's just called The Game
There'll be no referees, no halftime reports
When the game is over, The Game is over
You can't put a quarter in the machine

In my black locs, lookin' at you

Left for dead, you know who to thank for that
Finished my second LP without a Dr. Dre track
You can take my soul but can't take my plaques

Peelin slugs at your mug
Dealin drugs in front of the projects
My projects, more scatter, more street
Makin room for more drama, more hustle, more heat
I can show you how to get, American money easy
It's the gangster, all motherf**kers envy
Leave all semi I tote, clips empty
Foes tempt me, I'm seein no penitentiary
Crime scene clean, shells, no prints
Flee the shootout, X-5, no {?}
It's meant for me to survive this gangster shit
Meant for you not to be livin', food for the pigeons
It's rules I'm givin, new lessons for the street
This jungle I'm from B don't breed no weak
Lames that don't know the game please don't speak
You get killed, want me peeled, I'm showin no {?} nigga
Every nigga out there claimin to be the illest
I don't know if y'all know let a nigga know I'm lost in the stipulations
Niggas hatin', everybody waitin for the outcome
Whatever happened to just to rappin?
(Mic graspin, freestyle flow flashin)
(Rippin up tracks and, doin the thang)
(What'chu niggas know about Sean T and the Game?)
(Who's the illest?)
(Sean T)
I'm off the rack like slabs of ribs, I want it big
I ain't f**kin with kids, I'm after six digit things
F**k the rings and the tribulations, constant playa hatin
This crimin-al lifestyle, keeps me animatin
Let's turf talk before you niggas thuggin it up
It don't matter if you Crip'n, or Blood'n it up
Dallas Squad blooded it up, smashin on sight
But he hoppin on haters like BMX bikes
F**k around with the Squad see unbearable sights
We takin gangster shit to the maximum height
But I'm mainly into bubblin, fat grip doublin
Big heads I'm lovin 'em, you feelin me y'all
Leavin the envious in awe cause I tremendously ball
I'm supported by the Game so you know I won't fall
I'ma execute my options, keep wettin my paws
And come out unscathed with no scratches or flaws
Who's the illest
(Chorus)
(The Game)
They say ""Game, you rappin like you from the East coast,"" meet toast
Gun jammed in your throat, forgot that you spoke
Game got the streets woke young'n, same nigga got the coke runnin
Introduce the new fiends to smack
Pops told me when I was younger, you can't live like that
So I don't listen to pops nigga I listen to Kool G. Rap
Went from hustlin sacks to heavy weight, shufflin crack
Kids and preachers know me, young Game the O.G
Ask the reverand kept the church from fallin, young'uns from starvin
I'm the project like Marcy or the Nickerson Gardens
Comfortable dawg, Compton to Harlem, any city ghetto or hood
Kick back, blowin, listen to Marvin
Get head, count dough and just sit in the apartment
AK in the sofa, I'm the illest, who come closer
To the late ones or great ones fightin over a crown
Get shot off that throne, who the illest now, huh?
(Chorus)
(Sean T)
Some say the gangster mentality is dead, imagine that
When fools pullin straps out with infrared
We're livin in a time of plagues and corrupt life
When homies in the circle end up all trife
Tryin to shine bright, but lookin all dim
Meanwhile I stay sharp like a ballpoint pen
I see the smirks and grins but I just laugh
Cause I'm gettin lucrative loot, endless math
If you only knew the half of it, you wouldn't hate
But niggas just pig and talk shit behind Jake
Man you cain't knock the hustle, I ain't fin' to be greedy
I want an exit out the game kinda like Paul Vitti
I'm tryin to slang CD's in cruise control
Instead of sellin illegal pharmaceuticals

I won't feel pain when you tell me I'm the only one for you
And you for me. Now it's after dark, down with Val and Steve

Who really the best rapper since 'Pac got killed
I done answered that question when I copped my deal
Ask yourself when the Game is comin, after next summer
I predict my shit'll drop before the next Howard homecoming
Now who in the runnin, no one, ask the niggas who want it
I got a four-fifth and it just like me, it stay gunnin
Me and my niggas stay blunted fogged up in the 600
Guilty as charged, blunts in the air, guns in the doors
It's written, Compton niggas never run from the law
Plus we get Monopoly money with hotels and a board
So I'll never see a jail, and I'm allergic to bars
Can't sit behind 'em or drink at 'em, so we travel with ours
Poppin Crist' in the 6, like we drivin through Mardi Gras
Thinkin 'bout beads and titties as I roll through the city
And I keep 16 in the clip, and I let 'em all go
Like the Lakers did Ellie, Atty and Nick, huh

Bodies pop up in dumpsters, mothers start cryin
Payback come through violent, nigga

Before you even try to play, foolish all over
Empty out yo' pockets, turn everything over
We ball out cursin yeah we keep it the sickest
When we roll by the quads in them Z-66's
Big spittin, grip kitten, that big face greed
Always dirty never clean but we live like kings

Shoot me a glass of Remy, nah fuck it the whole bottle
And watch me act bad and take off, full throttle

Reflections in the Mirror,UnKnown,UnKnown,"I see Donnie from the block try’na stay afloat
He in the middle of a lake with no paddle boat
With no safety, they try’na take D
To a place where suicide is healthy
Stuck in a one-man box filled with anger
Luger to his temple with a bullet in the chamber
Suicide note to his mom and his brother
Text to his dad and another to his lover
Life gettin’ heavy on Donnie, he couldn't take it
Mind started eroding, body couldn't take it
Gone off them Ecstasy tabs and evеn Heroin
Everyday drug - treat it likе it's medicine
Gone off the deep end, six-feet sleepin’
Death around the corner, Rigor Mortis crept in
Body turn cold, heart stop racin’
Sow no more - life's been taken


It's like Sherry from the Hills had a good escape
Until she ran into the pain of bein’ raped
She never told a soul, kept her mouth closed
Too afraid of her secret bein’ exposed
Her father took advantage at an early age
Momma never knew but if she did she'd turn in her grave
Nowhere to run to, feelin’ like god's mistake
She sold herself to the streets as life's escape
No trust for men, that was broken
Stay soft spoken goin’ thru the motions
Body turn cold, heart stop racin’
Sow no more - life's been taken


Some men don't and some men got it
Find yourself and start cleanin’ out your closets
You see the devil in the mirror
You're lookin’ at yourself and your vision’s gettin’ clearer
Seen it from a mile away you can't tell me
Kill yourself like the 'Marshall Mathers LP'
Go ahead and do it, it's goin’ down
Grab the TEC, spin the barrel, cock it back
You know what's next
Let me guide you, an angel is beside you
Follow me, don't do it I'll revive you
I'll bring hope in your life - you're needed!
You're necessary to this world - believe it!
He try’na steal your joy, he try’na take you
I follow your path to try to save you
Stay true, stay wise, stay you - stay loyal
