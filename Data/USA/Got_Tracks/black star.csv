Respiration,Mos Def & Talib Kweli Are Black Star,1998.0,"""What'd you do last night?""
""We did, umm, two whole cars
It was me, Dez, and Mean Three, right?
And on the first car in small letters it said
'All you see is…' and then, you know
Big, big, you know, some block silver letters
That said 'crime in the city', right?""
""It just took up the whole car?""
""Yeah, yeah, it was a whole car and shit...""
Escúchela, la ciudad respirando
Escúchela, la ciudad respirando
Escúchela, la ciudad respirando
Escúchela...

The new moon rode high in the crown of the metropolis
Shinin', like ""Who on top of this?""
People was tusslin', arguin' and bustlin'
Gangstas of Gotham hardcore hustlin'
I'm wrestlin' with words and ideas
My ears is pricked, seekin' what will transmit
The scribes can apply to transcript
Yo, this ain't no time where the usual is suitable
Tonight alive, let's describe the inscrutable, the indisputable (What?)
We New York, the narcotics
Draped in metal and fiber optics
Where mercenaries is paid to trade hot stock tips for profits
Thirsty criminals pick pockets
Hard knuckles on the second hands of working-class watches
Skyscrapers is colossus, the cost of living is preposterous
Stay alive, you pay or die, no options
No Batman and Robin
Can't tell between the cops and the robbers
They both partners, they all heartless, with no conscience
Back streets stay darkened where unbeliever hearts stay hardened
My eagle talons stay sharpened, like city lights stay throbbin'
You either make your way or stay sobbin'
The shiny Apple is bruised, but sweet
And if you choose to eat, you could lose your teeth
Many crews retreat
Nightly news repeat who got shot down and locked down
Spotlight the savages, NASDAQ averages
My narrative grows to explain this existence
Amidst the harbor lights which remain in the distance

So much on my mind that I can't recline
Blastin' holes in the night 'til she bled sunshine
Breathe in, inhale vapors from bright stars that shine
Breathe out, weed smoke retrace the skyline
Heard the bass ride out like an ancient mating call
I can't take it, y'all, I can feel the city breathin'
Chest heavin', against the flesh of the evenin'
Sigh before we die like the last train leavin'

Breathin' in deep city breaths, sittin' on shitty steps
We stoop to new lows, Hell froze the night the city slept
The Beast crept through concrete jungles
Communicatin' with one another
And ghetto birds where waters fall
From the hydrants to the gutters
The Beast walk the beats, but the beats we be makin'
You on the wrong side of the track, lookin' visibly shaken
Takin' them plungers
Plungin' to death that's painted by the numbers
With Krylon applied pressure; cats is playin' God
But havin' children by a lesser baby mother, but fuck it
We played against each other like puppets, swearin' you got pull
When the only pull you got is the wool over your eyes
Gettin' knowledge in jail like a blessin' in disguise
Look in the skies for God, what you see besides the smog
Is broken dreams flyin' away on the wings of the obscene
Thoughts that people put in the air
Places where you could get murdered over a glare
But everything is fair
It's a paradox we call reality
So keepin' it real will make you casualty of abnormal normality
Killers Born Naturally, like Mickey and Mallory
Not knowin' the ways'll get you capped like an NBA salary
Some cats be emceein' to illustrate what we be seein'
Hard to be a spiritual being
When shit is shakin' what you believe in
For trees to grow in Brooklyn, seeds need to be planted
I'm askin' if y'all feel me and the crowd left me stranded
My blood pressure boiled and rose
'Cause New York niggas actin' spoiled at shows
To the winners, the spoils go
I take the L, transfer to the 2, head to the gates
New York life type trife, the Roman Empire state

So much on my mind, I just can't recline
Blastin' holes in the night till she bled sunshine
Breathe in, inhale vapors from bright stars that shine
Breathe out, weed smoke retrace the skyline
Yo, don't the bass ride out like an ancient mating call? 
I can't take it, y'all, I can feel the city breathing
Chest heaving, against the flesh of the evening
Sigh before we die like the last train leaving

¡Escuchela... Respirando como yo… Ojos sinceros, escondiendo pena y temor… El silencio de mentira, tocando al hogar escapando sentimientos entre ella y yo…

Yo, on The Amen
Corner I stood lookin' at my former hood
Felt the spirit in the wind, knew my friend was gone for good
Threw dirt on the casket, the hurt, I couldn't mask it
Mixin' down emotions, struggle I hadn't mastered
I choreograph seven steps to Heaven
In Hell, waiting to exhale and make the bread leaven
Veteran of a cold war; it's Chica-I-go for
What I know or what's known
So some days I take the bus home, just to touch home
From the crib I spend months gone, sat by the window
With a clutched dome listening to shorties cuss long
Young girls with weak minds, but they butt strong
Tried to call, or at least beep the Lord but didn't have a touch-tone
It's a dog-eat-dog world, you gotta mush on
Some of this land I must own, outta the city, they want us gone
Tearing down the 'jects creating plush homes
My circumstance is between Cabrini and Love Jones
Surrounded by hate, yet I love home
Ask my guy how he thought travelling the world sound
Found it hard to imagine he hadn't been past downtown
It's deep, I heard the city breathe in its sleep
Of reality I touch, but for me it's hard to keep
Deep, I heard my man breathe in his sleep
Of reality I touch, but for me it's hard to keep

So much on my mind, I just can't recline
Blastin' holes in the night till she bled sunshine
Breathe in, inhale vapors from bright stars that shine
Breathe out, weed smoke retrace the skyline
Yo, how the bass ride out like an ancient mating call? 
I can't take it, y'all, I can feel the city breathing
Chest heaving, against the flesh of the evening
Kiss the odds goodbye, I'm on the last train leaving",https://genius.com/Black-star-respiration-lyrics
Thieves in the Night,Mos Def & Talib Kweli Are Black Star,1998.0,"Yo D, what? Come on (Yeah)
What? What? Come on (Yeah)

""Give me the fortune, keep the fame"" said my man Louis
I agreed, know what he mean because we live the truest lie
I asked him why we follow the law of the bluest eye
He looked at me, he thought about it, was like, ""I'm clueless, why?""
The question was rhetorical, the answer is horrible
Our morals are out of place and got our lives full of sorrow
And so tomorrow coming later than usual
Waiting on someone to pity us
While we find the beauty in the hideous
They say money's the root of all evil, but I can't tell
You know what I mean, pesos, francs, yens, cowrie shells
Dollar bills, or is it the mindstate that's ill?
Creating crime rates to fill the new prisons they build
Over money and religion, there's more blood to spill
The wounds of slaves in cotton fields that never heal
What's the deal?
A lot of cats who buy records are straight broke
But my language universal, they be reciting my quotes
While R&B singers hit bad notes, we rock the boat of thought
That my man Louis' statements just provoked
Caught up, in conversations of our personal worth
Brought up, through endangered species status on the planet Earth
Survival tactics means, busting gats to prove you hard
Your firearms are too short to box with God
Without faith, all of that is illusionary
Raise my son, no vindication of manhood necessary

Not strong (Only aggressive)
, not free (We only licensed)
Not compassionate, only polite
 
(Now who the nicest?)
Not good, but well behaved
(Chasing after death so we can call ourselves brave?)
Still living like mental slaves
Hiding like thieves in the night from life
Illusions of oasis making you look twice
Hiding like thieves in the night from life
Illusions of oasis making you look twice

Yo, I'm sure that everybody out listening agree
That everything you see ain't really how it be
A lot of jokers out running in place, chasing the style
Be a lot going on beneath the empty smile
Most cats in my area be loving the hysteria
Synthesized surface conceals the interior
America, land of opportunity
Mirages and camouflages,
 more than usually
Speaking loudly, saying nothing, you confusing me, you losing me
Your game is twisted, want me enlisted in your usury
Foolishly, most men join the ranks cluelessly
Buffoonishly accept the deception, believe the perception
Reflection rarely seen across the surface of the looking glass
Walking the street, wondering who they be looking past
Looking gassed with them imported designer shades on
Stars shine bright, but the light rarely stays on
Same song, just remixed, different arrangement
Put you on a yacht, but they won't call it a slave ship
Strangeness, you don't control this, you barely hold this
Screaming ""brand new"", when they just sanitized the old shit
Suppose it's, just another clever Jedi mind trick
That they been running across stars through all the time with
I find it's distressing, there's never no in-between
(We either niggas or Kings, we either bitches or Queens)
The deadly ritual seems immersed in the perverse
Full of short attention spans, short tempers, and (short skirts)
Long barrel automatics released in (short bursts)
The length of black life is treated with (short worth)
Get yours first, them other niggas secondary
That type of illing that be filling up the cemetery
This life is temporary, but the (soul is eternal)
Separate the real from the lie, let me learn you
(Not strong), only aggressive 'cause the power ain't directed
That's why we are subjected to the will of the oppressive
(Not free), we only licensed,
 
not live, we just exciting
'Cause (the captors) own (the masters to what we writing)
Not compassionate, only polite, (we well trained)
Our sincerity's rehearsed in stage, (it's just a game)
Not good, but well behaved, 'cause the cameras survey
(Most of the things that we think, do or say)
We chasing after death just to call ourselves brave
But everyday, (next man meet with the grave)
I give a damn if any fan (recall my legacy)
(I'm trying to live life in the sight of God's memory)
(Like that) y'all

A lot of people don't understand the true criteria of things
Can't just accept the appearance, have to get the true essence
(They ain't looking around)

Not strong (Only aggressive)
, not free (We only licensed)
Not compassionate, only polite
 
(Now who the nicest?)
Not good, but well behaved
(Chasing after death so we can call ourselves brave?)
Still living like mental slaves
Hiding like thieves in the night from life
Illusions of oasis making you look twice
Hiding like thieves in the night from life
Illusions of oasis making you look twice
Hiding like thieves in the night from life
Illusions of oasis making you look twice
Hiding like thieves in the night from life
Illusions of oasis making you look twice

Stop hiding, stop hiding
Stop hiding yo' face (yes, c'mon)
Stop hiding, stop hiding (celebrating death)
'Cause ain't no hiding place
Stop hiding, stop hiding
Stop hiding yo' face
Stop hiding, stop hiding
'Cause ain't no hiding place

Sample

Hello, everybody. Recording live from somewhere
Looooord... Lord have mercy
Black Star
All nice and decent crew
This is timeless! C'mon!
Follow me now, we say
Say, Hi-Tek, yes, you're ruling hip-hop
Put your hands up! C'mon, c'mon!
Say, J. Rawls, yes, you're ruling hip-hop
Put your hands up, everybody
Redefinition, say, you're ruling hip-hop
Put your hands up, c'mon
Say, Black Star, come to rock it non—

Yo, from the first to the last of it, delivery is passionate
The whole and not the half of it, forecast and aftermath of it
Projectile that them blasted with, accurate assassin shit
Me and Kweli close like Bethlehem and Nazareth
After this, you be pressing rewind on top your master disk
Shining like an asterisk for all those that be gathering
Connecting like a roundhouse
 from the townhouse to the tenements
'Cause all my Brooklyn residents, known as heavy regiments
Don't believe, here the evidence—where Brooklyn? (WHOA!)
See that? Bound to take it all, kid, believe that
From where they sell they tree at, to where the police be at
Talib Kweli, e-Kweli-ty, yo, tell 'em where we be at;

Brooklyn, New York City, where they paint murals of Biggie
In cash we trust, 'cause it's ghetto fabulous, life look pretty
What a pity—
blunts is still fifty cents, it's intense
Tree scents is dominant, can't be covered with incense
My presence felt; my name is Kweli 
from the Eternal Reflection
People thinking MC is shorthand for misconception
Let me meditate, set it straight
, 
came to the conclusion
That most of these cats is featherweight
, let me demonstrate
Walking the streets is like battling; be careful with your body
You must know karate and think your soul is bulletproof like Sade
Stop actin' like a bitch already, be a visionary
And maybe you can see your name in the column of obituaries
Third grade teacher reading and talking about, ""I knew he'd amount to nothing.""
Neighbors like, ""He was the quiet type, who'd have thought they was fronting?""
Talking loud like you on RCA, get carted away with
Body parts and trays, what a way to start your day, yo, it's like—

One, two, three (C'mon!)
Mos Def and Talib Kweli
We came to rock it on to the tip-top (C'mon!)
Best alliance in hip-hop, Y-O
I said, one, two, three
It's kind of dangerous to be a MC (C'mon!)
They shot 2Pac and Biggie
Too much violence in hip-hop, Y-O

I said Manhattan keep on making it, Brooklyn keep on taking it
So, relax, we're taking it back
, Red Hook where we're living at
Plenty cats be struggling not hustling and bubbling
It ain't about production, then —what is we discussing?
When the cock crows, my crop grows,
 enable me to rock flows
Striving for perfection ever since I was a snot-nose
Colossal! True, original b-boy apostle
Standing on the rooftop with the Zulu Gestapo

You think you the shit? Somebody in the wings'll force you to quit
It could be your crew or clique or some random kid you smoked buddha with
Consider me the entity within the industry without a history
Of spitting the epitome of stupidity
Living my life, expressing my liberty, it gotta be
Done properly, 
my name is in the middle of equality
People follow me, and other cats they hear 'em flow
And assume I'm the real one with the lyrics like I'm Cyrano

Still sipping wishing well water imported from Pluto
Three hundred and sixty milliliters for all the believers
In miles or kilometers, most cats, cannot precede us
In the jungle with the leaders, we them lions, you the cheetahs
Our cypher will complete us as we come through 
your receivers
You can play us and repeat us and then take us home and read us
(Line for line) Good Jesus! 
Mos Def and Kweli just
Make a pussy freeze up; think it over, ease up

One, two, three
Mos Def and Talib Kweli
We came to rock it on to the tip-top

Redefinition, turning your play into a tragedy
Exhibit level degree on the mic, passionately
Niggas is sweet so I bet if I bit I'd get a cavity
Living to get high, you ain't flyer than gravity
We die hard like the battery thrown in the back of me by the mad MC
Who think imitation is the highest form of flattery, actually
Don't be mad at me, I had to be the one to break it to you
You get kicked into obscurity like judo—no, Menudo
Cause you pseudo, trying to compete with reality like Xerox
Towards destruction you spiraling like helix, wipe them teardrops
Chasing stars in your eyes, playing games with your lives
Now the wives is widows soaking up pillows, weeping like willows
Still more blacks is dying, cause they live and they trying
""How to Make a Slave"" by Willie Lynch is still applying
Regardless, the Mos is one of my closest partners
Rocking ever since before Prince was called The Artist
Rocking before Funkmaster Flex was rocking Starter
When 'Pac and Biggie was still cool, before they was martyrs
Life or death, if I'm choosing with every breath I'm enhancing
Stop, there comes a time when you can't run

What, lyrically handsome, call collect a king's ransom
Jams I write soon become the ghetto anthem
Way out like Bruce Wayne's mansion, move like a
Phantom
You'll talk about me to your grandsons
Cats who claiming they hard be mad fags
So I run through 'em like flood water through sandbags
Competition is mad, what I got, they can't have
Sinking they ship, like Moby Dick to Ahab
Son I'm way past the minimum, entering millennium
My raps will hold a gat to your back like Palestinians
Ancient Abyssinia, sure to hold the Gideon
Official b-boy gentlemen, long term, never the interim
Born inside the winter, when?
Day after December 10
These simpletons they mentionin' the synonym for feminine
Sweeter than some cinnamon, the Danish rings by Entenmann's
Rush up on adrenaline, they get they asses sent to them
(Gentlemen) you got a tenement, well then assemble it!
Leave your unit trembling like herds of moving elephant
Intelligent embellishment, follow for your element
From Flatbush settlement, skin possesses melanin
Hotter than tales of crack peddling, making 'em
WOOP like blue gelatin, swing like Duke Ellington
Broader than Barrington Levi, believe me
The hot Apache red who burn down your chief teepee
You see me?

One two three, Mos Def and Talib Kweli
We came to rock it on to the tip-top
Best alliance in hip-hop, wayohh
I said, one two three, Black Star shine eternally
We came to rock it on to the tip-top

Against the canvas of the night appears a curious celestial phenomenon, called Black Star, but what is it?
Black people unite and let's all get down
We got to have what? We got to have that love

What is the Black Star?
Is it the cat with the black shades, the black car?
Is it shinin' from very far, to 
where you are?
It is commonplace and different
Intimate and distant, fresher than an infant
Black, my family thick
 like that-strap molasses
Star
 on the rise, in the eyes of the masses
Black is the color of my true love's hair
Stars
 
are bright, shining, hot balls of air
Black like my baby girl's stare
Black like the veil that the Muslimina wear
Black like the planet that they fear, why they scared?
Black like the slave ship belly that brought us here
Black like the cheeks that are roadways for tears (
Mm
)
That leave black faces well traveled with years
Black like assassin crosshairs
Blacker than my granddaddy armchair
He never really got no time to chill there
'Cause this life is warfare, warfare
Deep on the front lines, the Blacks is all there
Black like the perception of who on welfare
Black like faces at the bottom of the well
I've been there before
To bring the light and heat it up like
 
la cocina
Make without imagine happen but maybe I'm just a dreamer
I love rocking tracks like John Coltrane love Naima
Like the student love the teacher
Like the prophet love Khadija
Like I love my baby' features
Like the Creator love all creatures
Who are knowledge, truth, and peace seekers
We on point like heatseekers
Targetting the black marketing strategists
Run up on em with the 
heaters
Everybody followin' with no leaders
Feelin like we killin' ourselves because I know they can't defeat us
It don't stop 'til we complete this, keep this fly
There's so much to life when you just stay Black and die
Blacker than the nighttime sky of Bed-Stuy in July
Blacker than the seed in the blackberry pie
Blacker than the middle of my eye
Black like Fela man cry
Some man wan' ask, ""Who am I?""
I simply reply, ""The U.N.I.-V.E.R.S.A.L. 
Magnetic
""
Work to respect the angelic (
Ugh!
)
Climb the mountain top and tell it
 'til the valley's enveloped
You're full of big chat 
but you nah know me
I'm dark like the side of the moon you don't see
When the moon shine newly
You know who else is a Black Star? (
Who?

Be shinin' and shinin', when we rhymin' and rhymin'
We be shinin' and shinin', when we rhymin' and rhymin'

two

You know the light
 come from the dark
The other way is ass-backwards
It's absurd, 
make you wanna crow like a blackbird
That's right, 
you livin' from your first day to your last night
Sometimes you show your ass like
 lint on your clothes
When you froze in the
 
black light
, dead that
Before you get your head wrapped
 like Badu
We see through your voodoo
Just like Eve's Bayou, you dealin' with that black magic
Try to civilize you, 
not walk on by you
Like Sybil 
lies do
, get you blacklisted
, it'll
Be unlucky for you like a black cat,

Twice Inna Lifetime,Mos Def & Talib Kweli Are Black Star,1998.0,"Yo, we been through this before right? (Word, word)
So we figured, if we gon' do it, we gotta freak it
You know what I'm sayin? (True, true, true)
Cause, everything gotta go up from here, right?
So Hi-Tek, turn it up a notch

Hail Mary, matter fact, hail Jane
Niggas take my name in vain like I was cocaine
My affirmations kill emcees like assassination
Bringin' you pain until you wish you had a vaccination
Or vaccine, I shine like Vaseline
Gas plays like petroleum, walk over them like linoleum
My vocab expand like a rubber band
Walkin' naked through the motherland, give the finger to my brotherman
You niggas just don't understand my reasons
I transcend like season, 
and scar these rappers like Legion
It's treason, my suspension attract attention
I'm ventin', givin' these chickenheads detention
Did I mention my name? Yo, go by the Jane Doe
Drenched in Polo, chill downtown in Soho
You don't know, this is just half my potential
Check my credentials, come harder than sequential
It's essential, you listen, I drive, you a pedestrian
They bless me on the track cause I attack wit' the estrogen
Rhyme against the best of men, Jane burn it up
When you hear it in the whip, tell your man to turn it up!

Yo, get it, yo
Yo, we fortified live, supportin' allies
The wack is tryna shorten our lives, it sorta waters my eyes
But here somethin' the cryin' talk about, the verse on that cassette
You and your cousin fought about
, 
that led to God and Satan's fallin' out
Encourage the liquor for those who ain't here that you pourin' out
On three-way, your parents, preacher and spouse called my house
Revive or ruin, my theories of mics
Sony or Aiwa, black or white, I fit in all stereotypes
Search for a cast to plot, I make you a laughin' stock
So shook, I could walk a half a block and feel the aftershocks
Rain of acid drops, seek some help, now don't rewind
Get it the first time, shouldn't have to repeat myself
Eternally verbally, I have numbers succumb to time outs
In rhyme bouts, you'll dial 9, just to get a line out
Known fact or factors and non-rappers fractured
Results more cast appearances than a hundred actors
Emcees I'm testin' like diseases injected in gerbils
Wordsworth, Kweli, Hi-Tek, Reflection Eternal, what?

My style highlights like fonts when I 
burn heads like a conk
Cause niggas front, when their chances get slim like Pharoahe Monch
Thinkin' they shits is heavy when they light like illumination
Intellectual masturbation with premature ejaculation
I'm comin' cleaner than vaccinations, my fascination with character
Assassination, got these niggas burnin' like sensation
We keep it hot like matches, and on lock like latches
Wack emcees get they microphones snatched like Lee patches
So you go, to every wack muthafucka that you know (Scram...)
My lyrics they get up in your jeans like Parasucos
So there's no mystery about the father, niggas is hot and bothered
Like the bitches that they are, takin' pictures with stars
And got 'em open, but after they little hopes and dreams get broken
Me and Hi-Tek, we live long and prosper like Vulcans
Think I'm jokin'? We both got sons, we make cream and break dreams
See through the fake schemes, wipin' your slate clean
Like a squeegee, 
we be lightin' shit up like phosphorus
Turnin' flamboyant niggas anonymous, depressin' to optimist
You stoppin' us is preposterous like an androgynous misogynist
You pickin' the wrong time, steppin' to me when I'm in my prime like Optimus
Transformin',
 from rookie of the year to veteran
Hip-hop is big business like Con Edison or medicine
But fuck it, they gonna let us in, or else we rush the door
I got too many reasons, save your 'whys' and 'what fors'
[Chorus: Talib Kweli & 
Mos Def
]
This is twice in a lifetime so I'm lettin' you know (let 'em know yo)
Black Star, Wordsorth, Punchline and Jane Doe (yo!)
Lyrical compete and we emcee
We got the fortified five, exhibit level degree

Check it
I keep dough in my pocket while you follow the false prophet
Get deep like Islamics wrapped in a white garment
I touch topics that try to open up your optics
Vacate in the tropics, you dodgin' bullets in the projects
Cut the nonsense, I'm hotter than a lot of men
Start honorin', got more wifeys than Solomon
Fuck the squad you in, ayo, we be the bid-domb
Regardless what I spit on, you worse with the tracks I shit on
Once you get on, it's fair you can't trust (Yes!)
Words & Punch, make rappers march like the third month
I build with friends, lyrically spit gems
Call me Diamond, cause I'm your girl's best friend
Emcees are born losers, alcoholic abusers
I'll go on the radio and start a gay rumor
And then I'll talk about how the crowd tried to boo ya
Label shoot ya, stressed out with brain tumors
My gat claps, 50% of the wack
Take it back to real rap, Krylons wit' 
the fat cap
Get robbed for your ASCAP
, leave you inside
Fortified live, reppin' NY 'til I die

Black body radiation situation that we workin' wit'
My verb exists enlisted by the bogeys campin' services
The purpose is, make you go and purchase this, no nervousness
We are, hot like black tar, Black Star with emergerence
Superlative, you fabricated like the word ""absurditive""
I'm rockin' this from here to where the Persians live
From Brooklyn where the merchants live next door to the murderers
And bourbon is a elder man's medicinal alternative
My memory is furnished with back streets to back seats to fat Jeeps
Legendary athletes who played by the trash heap
My crew wasn't that deep, but beef we didn't act sweet
Treadin' on these stompin' grounds, you better catch some black feet
Flashy, it was between DeKalb and Pulasky
Off the meter like an out of borough taxi
They run your pockets fastly, black and nasty, nappy and crafty
That's why they're either sittin' in Clinton or Coxsackie
Mayor Rudolph 
can screw off, you too soft to stop us
You and your coppers should see some foot doctors
Got your bird chest popped up, but keep your guns cocked up
Cause all them cats that you knocked up ain't always gon' be locked up
Hot stuff like Donna Summer, another number one-r
Comin' from the underground, this is how it's comin' down
Baby let me run it down: Mos Def, Talib
Kweli, Jane Doe, Punch, Word (ahem) E!
Excuse me, just ate another emcee
Sometimes that's just how it be
Partner wash you down with green tea and some lime
We like the five on the fist, fortified organized like this!",https://genius.com/Black-star-twice-inna-lifetime-lyrics
Hater Players,Mos Def & Talib Kweli Are Black Star,1998.0,"Yes
Every day somebody ask me where all the real MC's is at?
They underground
There's mad talented cats underground with that raw shit
Yaknowwhat'msayin? Bringin them raw skills
YaknowwhatI'm sayin?
Really, to me

It's a Small Wonder, like Vicki, why I'm picky
These niggas suck like hickies
And still get to slip they shit in like Mickies
I'm sick of the hater-players, bring on the regulators
With the flavors like a farm team fucking with the majors
Like a river how I run through it, I do it so cold
Freezin up your bodily fluids, your style is old
You runnin your mouth, but don't really know what you be talkin about
You should retire, get that complimentary watch, be out!
Yo, with the quickness, so swift you miss this lyrical fitness
Now get this, these emcees wanna test me like litmus, bear witness
I'm like shot clocks, interstate cops, and blood clots
My point is, your flow gets stopped!
By all means, you need more practice, take that ass home
Everybody lookin at you, fish tank syndrome
In full effect, I stay catchin lyrical rep
And keep it blacker than the back of your neck
What you expect, emcees hollerin
Cause we developin the followin
Gettin played like stone love tapes and dollar vans
Order reverse your universe so your demise is first
Before your rise it gets worse
You need a night nurse like Gregory
Beggin me - stop it hurts! - is what you say to me
Like that's supposed to mean somethin?
You the one I seen frontin in the club
Your act I don't buy it, I got the dub
Come on everybody, come on just show your love
Come on everybody, come on just show your love
Come on everybody, come on just show your love
Come on everybody, come on just show your love
Come on everybody, come on just show your love

Visions occupy my synaptic space
Command and shape, to illustrate my mind's landscape
The tall grass, the low plains, the mountanous ridges
Thickets among the forests, rivers beneath the bridges
Presence of hilltops, lit up with tree tops
Eavesdrop; and hear the incline of sunshine, nine
Stones in orbit, refuse to forfeit
They all form a cipher, and they came to absorb it
I follow suit, and face it, embrace it
Shinin bright, but still I'm careful not to waste it
Destined to rise, because I'm basement adjacent
Spirit is still so just chill and be patient
Some heads approach like I'm the one to base with
Clowns about to scream and shout but don't say shh...
I ain't your student so I ain't to be tested
I'm majestic, I represent my strength without effort
My, method is unorthodox, but of course it rocks
My serious synopsis will drop kick, my topics
Run the gauntlets and galvanize the audience
I must represent, I don't come off with no corniness
It's all luminary, despite commentary
Some people say, Mos how you get so?
My sign will make you jump around like calypso
And, murmur to yourself like a schizo
There ain't no bottom on the ???

Come on
Here we go, Blackstar, hop on the Blackstar line
We bout to take y'all home
YaknowwhatImean? Here we go

We got all markets on lock
From meat to stock
Black Star, what? Throwin like Kid Rock in bars
Men flock to where we are, cause its the place to be
I grab my paint, jump on stage and deface emcees
We sell our souls like Spawn and come for the throne I sit upon
Freestyle or written songs, shit we can get it on!
Going back and forth, forth and back, all across the track
Passin the mic's like quarterbacks
Of course its phat, get off of that!
Reverse psychology got em scared to say when shit is whack
Out of fear of being called a hater, imagine that!
We ain't havin that reachin past the star status that you grabbin at
My battle raps blast your ass back to your natural habitat
So floss, cause what it costs ain't worth it to me
Cause I'm the one these Spice Girl emcees Wannabe
But they can't, ain't no points for effort, so why bother?
Cause your girl calls my name out like Clarence Carter
Clarence Carter, Clarence Carter!
(I be strokin, that's what I be doin)
Aiyyo, as we rock harder
And always drop the bona-fide head nodders
Aiyyo, later for the hater-players
Yo-yo, yo-yo, later for these hater-players

What’s Beef?,UnKnown,2003.0,"Yo I was sold to a sick European by a rich African battlin'
Middle Passages, I can't go back again
Battlin' years of denyin' history, lies and mysteries
Wives with misty eyes watchin' their niggas be beaten viciously
Battle in the wilderness of North America
Ran by the river, only stoppin' to pray
Chased by predators
Terrorists with etiquette who vote and kill their president
Their capacity for evil so evident and prevalent
Ain't no hesitation involved, a nation dissolved
While we sit back waitin' to evolve
Those who would trade in their freedom
For their protection deserve neither
Fuck a name, fuck tradition
Religion - you learn Jesus
Turn the other cheek
Inherit the Earth, just stay meek
Fuck the way you speak
Try to walk, we chop off your feet
Fast forward to 2003, 
niggas beef
The psychology of children are slaves to run deep

Hell yeah, hell yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yo
What's beef? hell yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yo
That's beef, hell yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yo
It's always your own peoples
Sometimes it's your own peoples yo
Yeah yeah, hell yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yo
What's beef? hell yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yo
That's beef, hell yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yo
It's always your own peoples
Sometimes it's your own peoples yo

Beef is not what Jay said to Nas
Beef is when workin' niggas can't find jobs
So they tryna find niggas to rob
Tryna find bigger guns so they can finish the job
Beef is when the crack kids can't find moms
Cause they end up inna PINE box or locked behind bars
Beef ain't the Summer Jam for Hot 97
Beef is the cocaine and AIDS epidemic
Beef don't come with a radio edit
Beef is when the judge is callin' you ""defendant""
Beef, it comes with a long jail sentence
Handed down to you in a few short minutes
Beef is when your girl come through for a visit
Talkin' bout ""I'm pregnant by some other nigga""
Beef is high blood pressure and bad credit
Need a loan for your home and you're too broke to get it
And all your little kids is doin is gettin' bigger
You tryin not to raise 'em around these wild niggas
Beef is when a gold digger got your seed in her
A manicured hand out like ""pay me nigga""
Or I'm tellin' your wife
Or startin' up some foul rumor that'll ruin your life
Beef is when a gangster ain't doin it right
Another gangster then decided what to do with his life
Beef is not what these famous niggas do on the mic
Beef is what George Bush would do in a fight
Yeah, beef is not what Ja said to 50
Beef is Weldon Irv not bein here with me
When a soldier ends his life with his own gun
Beef is tryin' to figure out what to tell his son
Beef is oil prices and geopolitics
Beef is Iraq, the West Bank, and Gaza Strip
Some beef is big and some beef is small
But what y'all call beef is not beef at all
Beef is real life happenin' everyday
And it's realer than them songs that you get at Kay Slay

Nice, nice levels
Thank you Mr. Taxton
Fix up, look sharp, yo

I resolve, me and mine involved
A lot of cats talk live, they ain’t live at all
Sideline check, hush when it’s time to ball
Said you was charged an' all, I’m surprised at y'all
You could have a thousand rhymes, a thousand dimes
The house to shine, coupes on the routes recline
Be on Greenwich Mean, Beech Street, or Mountain time
But weigh it up, duke – your pound ain’t a ounce of mine
You’re down for mine, ashy and ground for mine
Yasiin so clear, true, pronounce divine
Pull down the blinds, shade them out or shine
Everything from Bangkok to Bucktown is mine
Say Black Star, great things sprout the mind
Full moons and starry nights, new life and true light
Desert flames and ancient names, cinematic classic frames
Beautiful and fantastic things
Like peace, equality; Allah see everything
Don’t call it a comeback, I was home anyway
Ain’t mister measure for all any time we been away
Travelling man I carry home with me every day
Bey, slim body push heavy weight
Fix up look sharp, 
elevate
And I don’t mean Copperfield or David Blaine
We on solid ground and far above the clouds,
 Black Star

The wait is over, or is it overweight
The game is bloated, there’s no escape
They sub-standard, we substantial
We got the great names, they got the love handles
We slimming down, trim the fat
Sit it down with all that chitter-chat
You talking this and that—
simmer down
Got my name in your mouth, spit it out, son
The music so powerful, use it to see the parallels
I could make it rain but I make it plainer than Malcolm does
Black Star, baby powder fresher than the talcum, yup
People charged up, yup, we good with or without the plug
You doubted us, but you’re still hating – wow, I’m proud of ya!
Committed to your cause and it’s caused you to be a sourpuss
Ain’t a number that could measure your level of cowardice
You Power Puff, 
you pale in comparison, don’t get out enough
Turn up the motherfuckers, the speakers ain't nearly loud enough
Black Star rocking it, Chaka would be proud of us
You had enough, callous as shallow and narrow-mindedness
Preparing for the battle, the shadows is where you finding us
You tryna bust – you dead, 
you synthetic as a designer drug
The populace is ignorant, thank you for reminding us
Separate myself from these rappers who hustle backwards
Yup, they got zero property, like the laws of algebra

Fix up look sharp
Black Star, good God
And when the sky look dark
Shine a light, look ahead, look up

Malcolm X and Marley Marl, the word of God,
 the works of art

Shut down Babylon
 
(Smash all automaton)
Feel the beat (Got 'em feeling geeked like it's Comic-Con)
Far from the hardy-har

Rocket launch,
 
Ali right cross knock they choppers off

Looking very sharp today (Thank you brother, Danke Schoen)
Craft working more than German engineering
(And all the frequency that don't adhere to interference)
Flashes of the spirit (Seekers of the clearing)
They say that the tongue is the mirror of the heart
 so mirror mirror
(Look, in that window is a freedom fighter’s grandson)
Fixed up looking sharp, automatic handgun
Look, parade, caravan (Diplomat, degenerate)
Messiah (Pariah) The leader of the syndicate
(Peace treaty written in) loophole penmanship
(Same rows, two sides) Palaces and tenements
Dispossessed native tongue noble open the lonely heart

Mojo vibrated and high Johns screamed through the bloods 'til 
Nomo hears the blood sounds
Nomo spoke intercourses and all the niggas listening acted missionaries too
Dig my people, they acted
The rhythms pulling their minds was one and move move moved
Universe-Earth spirits firing the soils to destroy the evil un-image
Cleanse the waste from the cold lands
Until the cosmos was whole again
And the world had become nude

You Already Knew,Black Star Aretha,2011.0,"Fight for the whole purse
Cause life is a cold verse

Mathematics is steel in the hour of
Chaos and God power love
Topple the Tower of Babylon
Break the great steel gate and elevate
Above all hate and all things
Grace, enthusiasm, sincerity, passion
Known through the classes and masses,
 massive
Trans-Atlantic mavericks, you are living Asiatic
The organic masters, the cream of the planet
The Panthers, sovereigns with answers
Medicine for madness, divine guideline for balance
Beyond sensational rapture
How clever to capture phony ceremony theatrics
So real it's surreal,
 look at my face
You could feel it before I had anything to say
Yasiin, Dante, Black Star, ever see all day
Fantastic, great, rise, elevate

How you doing, how you feel?

How you doing, how you feel?
And let the world spin round and round
No matter how it spin, it won't break me down

Consumer evil easing on down
Black and I'm proud, say

Way more than just a stereo filler -- rising way above it
People love it, our material realer
We spit heavy, Rick Perry is a serial killer
Forget Carrie at the prom with a bucket of blood
It gets scary
Get buried just for speaking your mind
Stopped so often driving on the Turnpike
It's like driving in a coffin
I'm asking who riding, but riding is quite exhausting
Calling cats forfeit who get with the game often
Looking for fame and fortune, they try to remain important
Consorting with them whores and releasing the same endorphins
A pimp is still pimping regardless of what you call him
Mahi-mahi ain't just a fancy name for dolphin
Never get caught up in a name -- ask Yasiin
The realest she ever seen, Talib Kweli Greene
Funny people used to give my mom a hard time
Now my President is black and his name is hard as mine
Imagine if the Tea Party was black as the Caucus
They would be at the rally telling cops back up off 'em
Do it for the glory, the ghetto, the war stories
Soldiers on shore leave who occupy Wall Street
For good chicks who give it up to God on Sundays
Pretty chicks walking on the project runways
Rocking black on black like the project gunplay
Your sun'll come back out one day, trust me

Before I made the news
You already know
And it's the truth
I said, before I make the news
You already know
And that's the truth
I said, before it made the news
You already knew
And that's the truth
And it never made the news
It don't need to make the news to be true
Black Star, black black too
What's up with you?
How you doing, how you feel?
How you doing, how you feel?

And let the world spin round and round
No matter how it spin, it won't break me down
I'm on solid ground, but far above the clouds

The sin of evil isn't going down
Black and I'm proud, say it now
I make them set their hands down, say

Little Brother,The Hurricane Soundtrack,2000.0,"'Now listen'

..doin this song for you
All my little brothers.. out in the street
Strugglin to survive.. keep your eyes on the prize, you know

Yeah, 
the revolution will not be televised
Or broadcast live on the net
My man Mos said it's personal.. knamsayin?
It's gotta start from right up in here, you know

You can't stop, you know 
You can't stop when we rep

We rep the ain't-gots
Ain't nobody can't start no party like us, we crush the faint hearts
From Hallsey to St. Mark's, walk in the main blocks
Painted with blood that's still hot, so deep it stain socks
The pain spark frustration, situations lead to hatin
Some deal with drug distribution, others walk the plantation
Some know the code a' the streets, some got a college education
Come down on the weekend, and peep the conversation

Yo
On the corner, units stormed out
Ghetto lookin bombed out
Police waited to roll, for those who walk the wrong route
Shorties goin all out, they got they swords drawn out
Ready to brawl out, gettin fought til they fall out
Black like Morehouse
, 40 o'z is tossed out
For brothers that they mourn bout, get wrecked til it's dawn out
Whether they broke or flossed out, honeys pass they draws out
Lookin for a ticket out the poor-house
A jungle out here
Lions keep they claws out, fangs and jaws out
Weak just get forced out
Names is called out, ghetto-fame is sought out
You wanna be the man that they talk bout
I walked out
I had some things on my mind to sort out
I thought bout the wild circumstance we born out
Remember myself at your age, when I was just like you
If that was now, I don't know what I would do
My ears is closest to me
So what I say to you is goin for me
Son we both still growin indeed
But where you at, I was, and where you been, I left
Utilize my experience to guide your step
Some people get love but don't command respect
It's somethin that you can't ride with a check
Or a rolly or lex or icy links that hang from your neck
If it's real, who need to deal with the special effects?

Come here, come here, yo
Lemme drop this on ya, look they gotchu cornered
The corner of the block is hot, I ain't got to warn ya
Cause I see you every day, trapped in every way
'Shit, I'm a thug, and that's all that I can say'
Who are you anyway?
Mary J.? I spend, many nights awake, watchin you while you sleep
Tryin to figure out how to be the example, cause talk is cheap
As you walk the streets, study cats on the real
In a convo, just make your point to relax and chill
 wanna destroy each other in a cypher instead a' build
Be a- man of will, don't be- standin still
If you- don't plan ahead, then you- plan to fail
Dudes be in a daze when the ways reveal
Like they funny style but I'm not laughin
Serious  makin money while the police is passin
Can't wait for opportunity to knock, you gotta make it happen
It ain't about no spectacular ways a' rappin
Just immaculate ways a' action.. dig?

Little Brother
I know that times is hard
Keep your mind on god
Stay clear of danger and harm n'
You'll get along
I sing my song
For little brothers
Out there in the street
Strugglin to make ends meet
Gotta hold the heat
Strugglin so hard to compete
Stay clear of danger and harm
Do it for y'all
Try to stay strong
Keep movin on ",https://genius.com/Black-star-little-brother-lyrics
Make it All Better,Mos Definite,UnKnown,"Yo why we typecast into all of this madness?
Humanity, ain't you tired?
Ghetto child, ain't you tired?
Universe, ain't you tired?
Let's speak, let's speak on it
Yo, why we typecast into all this madness?
Humanity, ain't you tired?

Yo, I keep a smile on my face, even when it's looking very grim
I think about them babies innocent like cherubim
I'm livin' in an era when
There is more black people owning things than it's ever been
In America. From small banks to big labels
Properties, and businesses even stations on cable
Still we're not able
To control the money
(There's) Swine still on the table
And ghettos across the country
Our babies stay hungry, but we got black senators in congress
That's the illusion of pro-gress
Getting hyped when you see blacks on TV is plain dumb
When them cats do not understand where they came from
Let's get everybody's head nodding to the same drum
Then have conversations that cross generations
It's then and only then you will see
That these kids imitate images from the seventies
That's the decade we were born into
Conforming to
The code of the pimp and the playa, what you wanna do?
Call that man ""Ghouli-ani""
Said, ""We've got no clue"", pro'bly
Forget about the Q-Tip's, Mos Def's, Talib Kweli's
The mindstate of those before us seems pathetic
Got the nerve to say my generation apathetic
But I don't sweat it
I just choose to assist
Boo-hoo all you want, just continue to exist

Refuse any fact that's not actual
Resist anything that's not natural
Refuse to let the current situation worsen
Resist anybody that's disrespecting your person
Refuse to be afraid, it's only God you should fear
Resist the temptation to act like you don't care
It's a struggle out there
And we all feel the pressure
You say it's all good, I wanna make it all better

They say that illegal business control America
The law man long arm is just a long barrell
There ain't a black butterfly
Black birds and sparrows, anything trying to fly
Their response to more black is more blue and more ammo
Check the local news channel
The commissioner, defendant is kin
Another long-winded lie again
Black folks gonna die again
When they say ""we"" they really mean us and them
The politics of division
Creating fresh revenue for prison
It's money, it's religion
They been running the same type of game
Since the slave holders settled the plane
It's very little remains
The capital gains
Control the domain
Closing the vein
So life can't circulate
Perpetrate the murder rate
Para military
Killin' Mary
That's the seed they sow
They gotta bleed to grow
But what they need to know
That what you reap
Is what you keep
Payback is better fruit to eat
It uproot the teeth
Enough to make the laughing tyrants stop smiling
They took him to the grave, but Lazarus was unsilent (3x)

Yo, yo, it's the doughnuts and coffee
That makes you too bossy
I really don't think you need to be walking the beat
And targeting civilians cause we're walking in the streets
Refrain from prejudice and refrain from eating sweets
Constitution's not made
For multi-raced slaves
There's more than Amadu who found a way to early grave
Gonna keep on happenin' and
Police is packin' and
Giuliani's yappin' and
You know the process
Cops is drinkin' beer on the streets, relieve stress
Looking for the lucky Latino with blackface
Keeping us inside a place
But it's not about race
Let 'em tell it. And a lot of y'all police is punks
Smackin' hustlers up and confiscating all their junk
Sellin' it back, scaring the cats into submission
Bustin' at the brothas cause we fit the description
Of the young and intelligent
Often wild talented
Ghetto child. Our dreams are snatched up with violence, kid
Gonna make you feel the pain if I can
It's the ordinary thing just a day for the man (3x)

Refuse any fact that's not actual
Resist anything that's not natural
Refuse to let the current situation worsen
Resist anybody that's disrespecting your person
Refuse to be afraid, it's only God you should fear
Resist the temptation to act like you don't care
It's a struggle out there
And we all feel the pressure

Small brats get they ass kicked, me and Mos smash it
Top gun like what comes after the, fist rockin' knife
Check the keys that get played on the roads of life
Yo the rhyme is so heavy like a load off my chest
Drop em' on these mc's, leave 'em broken like house pets
Priceless like the streets I'm on, my word is bond
You like Paula Abdul-skat-kat compared to Sarah Vaughan
Sayin, what did I do to be so black and blue
Got Mc's sayin ""damn, I gotta go on after you?""
Grab a microphone and do just what I have to do
Aiyyo, I'd like to stop and chat but I'm just passing through
You know I'd like to stop and chat but I'm just passing through

I'm on my way back to Louis Avenue
Inside Brooklyn the b-boy capital, lot of cat chat be too black and radical
Say, my response is emphatically yes
We emphatically fresh, you dramatically stressed
These mc's proceed to seize the presidential palace
And burn Babylon like a chalice
Strive to maintain balance
With the God given talent
Articulate the article, eliminate the farcical
Black Star Line shine remarkable, their style ain't even comparable
These so called criminals is fictional they make the party turn miserable

Ain't gonna give you no fame by callin out your name

Stay away from repetition don't wanna sound like no sample
You can't handle this Messiah
My shit is classical, We get buck like Umfufu, ""You treat me like animal!""
Just 'cus you got money, don't mean you made it
Just 'cus you make it don't give you the right to be on that fake shit
Matter fact stay out my face
I can't take it like them stupid big horse pills
Your defense is nil, my chatter, shatter your forcefield
Kweli and Mos Definition with more lines then a petition
Yo my mission is to break shit in half, like intermission
Then get missing with Hi-Tech in the wind like that
Costin' one million pounds 'cus it sound so fat
Lay you flat like the carpet
Take the tobacco out my spliff before you spark it
The only tye I rock is chocolate
Makin profits like Spacely Sprockets, you can't stop it
To top it, we always gonna be black like markets
From the underground, look around and tell me what you see

Who take the proper measurement to represent
The sort of home whose cornerstone is built on
Way more than Benjamin
Master MC carpentry
Talib puts the Kweli in quality
Put the groundation down properly
You can't trespass the property
Ain't takin'-or-breakin' robbery
Got the whole owner blast-back policy

What It Is,The Beautiful Mixtape Vol. 2: The Struggle Continues,UnKnown,"The way I feel
Sometime it's just hard to sit still
Life is too passionate, life is too real
Sometime I gotta chill, mellow back, blow a smoke
Smile on my face but it's really no joke
You feel it in the street the people breathe without hope
They going through the motion
They dimming down the focus
The focus get clear then the light turn sharp
And the eyes get teary
The mind grow weary
I speak it so clearly sometime ya'll don't hear me
I'll push it through a bass note maybe ya'll will feel me
I feel it in my bones and I'm so wide awake
I'm hardly ever sleep, my flow forever deep
When there's volumes of scriptures for volumes of beats
My presence speaks volumes before I say a word
I'm everywhere: penthouse, pavement or curb
Cradle to the grave tall cathedral or a shelf
Universal ghetto life holler black and know it well
Quiet storm, vital form
Pen push the right across
Line is a vital force
High, low or right across
Sure as a lion's roar
Voice is a siren
Then swing 'round, ring out, bring down a tyrant
Chop a small axe and knock a giant lopsided
The world is so DANGEROUS there's no need for frightin'
Niggas try to hide like the struggle won't find them
And the sun bust through the cloud to clearly to remind them
It's everywhere: penthouse, pavement to curb
Cradle to the grave tall cathedral or a shelf
Universal ghetto life holler black and know it well
What it is? You know, New York
What it is? Chi-Town, get down
What it is? Dirty south, work it out
The west you are now rockin' with the best
(What it is?) Mos Def, and Kweli - Black Star
(What it is?) Keep shinin', perfect diamond, under pressure
(What it is?) True and livin', got to give 'em, rythmn, blackness

It's the accurate assassin shit
The tool that you get blasted with
It's blacker than when the lights go off after disaster hits
Drop in with it faster but I've mastered it
You crash your whip
Pass it in my lane cause my materials are hazardous (Whoa)
These ain't just punchlines: I'll slap the shit out you
You try to disrespect the style my people blacking out to
This the, manual how to allow true
Skill to flow out you
So you the one that everybody bow to
Money get off your knees, that ain't what I mean
Cutting clean when I murder emcees the blood run inbetween
The gutters so what I utter obscene like Butterbean
Mean like Cinda Williams tight like the Flatbush Brothers in another scene
I'm mo' betta, the flow wetter than an orgasm
The word seize ya 'til ya rollin' on the floor with all sorts of spams
I'm off the chain, off the hook, fuck it, off the wagon
Get emcees mad like Jewish people when they saw The Passion
This that Black Star shit, the Pharaoh with the Cuban cigar
My people locked behind them so I spit bars
Black music, you could ease back relax to it
Pull out gats to it and clap to it
Blow out a back to it
Roll a bag or two or three to it
Blow a tree to it
It's that crack but we added a little poetry to it
Lean back like a smack user, the rap Zab Judah
Get you high without the side effects of your average juicer
What it is? 
Kweli, like ODB I'm for the kids
You know Black Star, Black Star (What it is?!)
Shining like eight lights we bright
This the cut give you a slice of life, think twice
What it is? Mos Def, and Kweli
The honorable and introduced properly
(What it is?!) Black Star never burn out
When we crash the party the whole ghetto turn out

... alright here I go
Yeah, Brooklyn's finest the God's favorite DJ
BK DJ Clark Kent, ya heard me?
And I'm shouting out to my man, my man, my man
One of the nicest ever, one of the nicest to do it
BK emcee Talib Kweli man
With that new shit, man, I'm with you let's ride...
You my nig-Yo Talib, for real, man, I really real-
Your album dude? (Alright) Whoa

Aiyyo Kweli I heard there's a function goin on at the D&D
Some things that I gotta see, heard that the Rawkus click
Was doin some ill shit wit my man Evil, and the rest of my people
Is you wit it?

I'm always wit it, always forget it
If you a MC, you couldn't get wit it, you too dim-witted
MC's come to and try to diss this
Chicks want Kweli for Christmas, on they wish list
Here we come through, kick the lyrical swiftness
You missed this, again it's over your head
Now I send it, over to my friend Mos Def
MC's got no fuckin rhymes left

*phone rings*
Hello, yes I got the call, don't need no answering machine at all
I got a, Caller ID to screen my calls
So I can see who's tryin to speak to me cuz frequently
A lot of cats try to get in touch but I don't want to be in they clutch
I got my man Kweli who I love very much, and such and such
My man, Rawkus click, we on some ill shit

I call 7-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Don't want to say his number, MC's is in slumber
Yo they wakin up they takin up too much time
Mos Def, I got to get in touch wit and get a Dutch
And then head over to his crib and say
""Yo look what these kids did, and I had my kids at my crib""
And I can't believe they tried to roll up on my like that
MC's come through because they always lookin wack

They always lookin wack cuz look at the way they dress
Thinkin you a Mister you must be a Miss
I'm watchin the slip underneath your skirt
Steppin to me like that kid you only get hurt
Son I stand five-ten wit the open palms, I'm droppin bombs
Wit the, urban songs and I never stay calm when I kick it
A matter of fact I get type wicked and very specific

And exquisite wit the beat, MC's is incomplete
They ain't like whole wheat, I need to eat
More of that for my nutrition, MC's catchin coniptions
They readin the writin on the wall like an Egyptian
Comin through is my verbal mission, to try to track you down
It's the MC formerly known as Genesis
You will remember this, it's your verbal nemesis
Yo, Mos Def is

Yo my style is original like fingerprints
I been down ever since, make you Reminisce like Pete Rock
When the beat drop, kids stop to listen
Because they hear the verbs glisten
I'll play your opposition like a fullback, I got the full pack
Just like a convict on lock, the beat never stop
And we come on time like a clock, this is the real hip-hop

The real hip-hop, try to test me, you get stomped
Why try, you get caught up in the paparazzi like Princess Di
Yo, come through we always lookin fly
MC's try to come up to me, they singin lullabyes
They on a plantation, I'll free you like Emancipation
From that thought you have is makin your mind needin some sanatation
I'm fillin the schools up like asbestos
It's best that you leave my premesis

And what's better, is to make cheddar
And try to get yo shit together
I freak it wherever and whenever just like Maxwell
The style that I got will tax well
Yo that just bomb, but I don't spend my time
Focusin on mistakes, I feed breaks

Pain so hard they you gon' be askin' for asprin
Sick to everlastin'
No way to make it happen, Jack
On the quest to manifest the unimagine, black
What they dealin' with is weak derivatives
You fiend over Benjamins, we seek deliverance

Smog and carcinogens, global imprisonment

Take aim, fire, empty, reload, and they spit again

Well make some noise if you with it then
Show the inner city kid there's no givin' in
No givin' up

Soul stirrin'
From the old school to the most current
It's on point and on mission and on purpose
Boots on, fiends don't hurt it
The long verse is a strong surgeon's
Straight off the turban
Some Sahara to the suburban
It's emergin', with each version
So each person
Within earshot, get a clear shot
Of red rock
They'll not, see the tear drops

You tryin to get a little rep off me or something, money?
Let me tell you something money, you don't know me like that
NawI'msayin, you don't know none of my crew like that
NawI'msayin, and if you really wanna make some little insinuation
About me nawI'msayin, don't talk about it, be about it money
If you wanna do something, we can do it right now

I levitate through meditation
Sitting my legs crossed, source to build force field
To shield my immediate surroundings
Avoiding falling sheet rock, rubble and granite
Expand, white man, got plans to feed the planet
Excessive hate, repercussions of manic-depressive state
Panic, God forbid we all take it for granted
Delivering lyrical thoughts for spiritual dividends
Half the concentrate, like Hampstead we'll be livin in
Magnetic boring them, it's a must I score again
And pollute em, shoot em like white students in Oregon
Cuz when I was broke, I always found figures to fuck bitches
Wit full-force like them muscle-bound niggas

Well it's the R-A-H, big up to Brick City
When I'm not rippin niggas I be ?feelin wit commitee?
Got two rap clicks, so bring all the kingred
Buggin off of rappers sayin shit that I been said
Askin me how your mob sound, bringin my high down
Flipmode put shit together quicker than a seamstress
Thinkin I talk white cuz I speak proper English
All up in your air like I was celly interference
Rip shows and make little cameo appearance
White label to death if I can't get no clearance

Wonderin who we talkin about, yo is my name in his mouth, well then
I'm talkin to you
No mystery, you ain't got to scratch your head
Like ""Is he dissin me?"", we talkin to you

Aiyyo we severed the lever that I pull
It's never the bull, shit instead of the full clip, click
You get hit in the head wit dialect
When I pre-fect my new script
Check the architecht then select the newest blueprint
When I pro-ject the move-ment of the mic, it might strike
And brand new life trife that handle
?Flyin off?, literature that's pure
Yo we miniature before, you finished yours, I get mine
Musically inclined, like the sign of a clef
To my death, I rhyme and yes I left you, sense-less in the mind
Plus I'm, going to show no re-pentance
My flow's relentless, you know the sentence

You will respect it when we set it
Fake MC's get tossed
For leavin the microphone covered wit the gloss
Don't get lost, bitch-asses who switch fastest
When my hits smashes, impacts like whip crashes
Fuckin up your face like thick glasses
You still can't see shit
I'll snatch your faith, your imagination won't believe it
It's ill, you can't conceive it
Any nigga can make a baby, it takes a man to be a father
Why bother, you'll be run over in the street like Frogger
Comatose like Central Park joggers when my crew goes wildin
Lyricist who will never Lounge till all wack shit is silenced
I'm not violent, niggas come aggressive wit that nonsense
Yo, it's time for us to get aggressive wit our conscience

Alot of cats think I'm chattin about

A very interesting young man who's traveled from very far away
To be with us tonight)
(Mos Def)
(yes, yes) yo yo yo yo (yes) yo yo
Aiyyo Kweli I heard there's a function goin on at the D&D
Some things that I gotta see, heard that the Rawkus click
Was doin some ill shit wit my man Evil, and the rest of my people
Is you wit it?
(Kweli)
I'm always wit it, always forget it
If you a MC, you couldn't get wit it, you too dim-witted
MC's come to and try to diss this
Chicks want Kweli for Christmas, on they wish list
Here we come through, kick the lyrical swiftness
You missed this, again it's over your head
Now I send it, over to my friend Mos Def
MC's got no fuckin rhymes left
(Mos Def)
(phone rings)
Hello, yes I got the call, don't need no answering machine at all
I got a, Caller ID to screen my calls
So I can see who's tryin to speak to me cuz frequently
A lot of cats try to get in touch but I don't want to be in they clutch
I got my man Kweli who I love very much, and such and such
My man, Rawkus click, we on some ill shit
(Kweli)
I call 7-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Don't want to say his number, MC's is in slumber
Yo they wakin up they takin up too much time
Mos Def, I got to get in touch wit and get a Dutch
And then head over to his crib and say
""Yo look what these kids did, and I had my kids at my crib""
And I can't believe they tried to roll up on my like that
MC's come through because they always lookin wack
(Mos Def)
They always lookin wack cuz look at the way they dress
Thinkin you a Mister you must be a Miss
I'm watchin the slip underneath your skirt
Steppin to me like that kid you only get hurt
Son I stand five-ten wit the open palms, I'm droppin bombs
Wit the, urban songs and I never stay calm when I kick it
A matter of fact I get type wicked and very specific
(Kweli)
And exquisite wit the beat, MC's is incomplete
They ain't like whole wheat, I need to eat
More of that for my nutrition, MC's catchin coniptions
They readin the writin on the wall like an Egyptian
Comin through is my verbal mission, to try to track you down
It's the MC formerly known as Genesis
You will remember this, it's your verbal nemesis
Yo, Mos Def is
(Mos Def)
Yo my style is original like fingerprints
I been down ever since, make you Reminisce like Pete Rock
When the beat drop, kids stop to listen
Because they hear the verbs glisten
I'll play your opposition like a fullback, I got the full pack
Just like a convict on lock, the beat never stop
And we come on time like a clock, this is the real hip-hop
(Kweli)
The real hip-hop, try to test me, you get stomped
Why try, you get caught up in the paparazzi like Princess Di
Yo, come through we always lookin fly
MC's try to come up to me, they singin lullabyes
They on a plantation, I'll free you like Emancipation
From that thought you have is makin your mind needin some sanatation
I'm fillin the schools up like asbestos
It's best that you leave my premesis
(Mos Def)
And what's better, is to make cheddar
And try to get yo shit together
I freak it wherever and whenever just like Maxwell
The style that I got will tax well
Yo that just bomb, but I don't spend my time
Focusin on mistakes, I feed breaks
This is the way that we make, and sound hype
When we stand on the mic
(Kweli)
We focus on true, we never dwell and hate
(DJ Evil Dee)

Respiration - (best of decade i version),UnKnown,UnKnown,"""What'd you do last night?""
""We did umm, two whole cars
It was me, Dez, and Main Three right?
And on the first car in small letters it said
'All you see is.' and then you know
Big, big, you know some block silver letters
That said '.crime in the city' right?""
""It just took up the whole car?""
""Yeah yeah, it was a whole car and shit...""
Escuchela. la ciudad respirando
(translation of spanish: Listen to it. the city breathing)
Escuchela
The new moon rode high in the crown of the metropolis
Shinin, like who on top of this?
People was tusslin, arguin and bustlin
Gangstaz of Gotham hardcore hustlin
I'm wrestlin with words and ideas
My ears is picky, seekin what will transmit
This ain't no time where the usual is suitable
Tonight alive, let's describe the inscrutable
The indisputable, we New York the narcotic
Strength in metal and fiber optics
Where mercenaries is paid to trade hot stock tips
For profits, thirsty criminals take pockets
Hard knuckles on the second hands of workin class watches
Skyscrapers is collosus, the cost of living
Is preposterous, stay alive, you play or die, no options
No Batman and Robin, can't tell between
The cops and the robbers, they both partners, they all heartless
With no conscience, back streets stay darkened
Where unbeliever hearts stay hardened
My eagle talons STAY sharpened, like city lights stay throbbin
You either make a way or stay sobbin, the Shiny Apple
Is bruised but sweet and if you choose to eat
You could lose your teeth, many crews retreat
Nightly news repeat, who got shot down and locked down
Spotlight to savages, NASDAQ averages
My narrative, rose to explain this existance
Amidst the harbor lights which remain in the distance
So much on my mind that I can't recline
Blastin holes in the night til she bled sunshine
Breathe in, inhale vapors from bright stars that shine
Breathe out, weed smoke retrace the skyline
Heard the bass ride out like an ancient mating call
I can't take it y'all, I can feel the city breathin
Chest heavin, against the flesh of the evening
Sigh before we die like the last train leaving
Breathin in deep city breaths, sittin on shitty steps
We stoop to new lows, hell froze the night the city slept
The beast crept through concrete jungles
Communicatin with one another
And ghetto birds where waters fall
From the hydrants to the gutters
The beast walk the beats, but the beats we be makin
You on the wrong side of the track, lookin visibly shaken
Taken them plungers, plungin to death that's painted by the numbers
With crime unapplied pressure, cats is playin God
But havin children by a lesser baby mother but fuck it
We played against each other like puppets, swearin you got pull
When the only pull you got is the wool over your eyes
Gettin knowledge in jail like a blessing in disguise
Look in the skies for God, what you see besides the smog
Is broken dreams flying away on the wings of the obscene
Thoughts that people put in the air
Places where you could get murdered over a glare
But everything is fair
It's a paradox we call reality
So keepin it real will make you casualty of abnormal normality
Killers Born Naturally like, Mickey and Mallory
Not knowing the ways'll get you capped like an NBA salary
Some cats be emceeing to illustrate what we be seeing
Hard to be a spiritual being when shit is shakin what you believe in
For trees to grow in Brooklyn, seeds need to be planted
I'm asking if y'all feel me AND THE CROWD LEFT ME STRANDED
My blood pressure boiled and rose, cause New York niggas
Actin spoiled at shows, to the winners the spoils go
I take the L, transfer to the 2, head to the gates
New York life type trife the Roman Empire state
So much on my mind I just can't recline
Blastin holes in the night til she bled sunshine
Breathe in, inhale vapors from bright stars that shine
Breathe out, weed smoke retrace the skyline
Yo don't the bass ride out like an ancient mating call
I can't take it y'all, I can feel the city breathin
Chest heavin, against the flesh of the evening
Sigh before we die like the last train leaving
Escuchela. respirando??
Yo... on The Amen, Corner I stood lookin at my former hood
Felt the spirit in the wind, knew my friend was gone for good
Threw dirt on the casket, the hurt, I couldn't mask it
Mixin down emotions, struggle I hadn't mastered
I coreograph seven steps to heaven
And hell, waiting to exhale and make the bread leavened
Veteran of a cold war It's Chica-I-go for
What I know or, what's known
So some days I take the bus home, just to touch home
From the crib I spend months gone
Sat by the window with a clutched dome listenin to shorties cuss long
Young girls with weak minds, but they butt strong
Tried to call, or at least beep the Lord, but didn't have a touch-tone
It's a dog-eat-dog world, you gotta mush on
Some of this land I must own
Outta the city, they want us gone
Tearin down the 'jects creatin plush homes
My circumstance is between Cabrini and Love Jones
Surrounded by hate, yet I love home
Ask my God how he thought travellin the world sound
Found it hard to imagine he hadn't been past downtown
It's deep, I heard the city breathe in its sleep
Of reality I touch, but for me it's hard to keep
Deep, I heard my man breathe in his sleep
Of reality I touch, but for me it's hard to keep
So much on my mind I just can't recline
Blastin holes in the night til she bled sunshine
Breathe in, inhale vapors from bright stars that shine
Breathe out, weed smoke retrace the skyline
Yo how the bass ride out like an ancient mating call
I can't take it y'all, I can feel the city breathing
Chest heavin, against the flesh of the evening
Kiss the Ide's goodbye, I'm on the last train leaving",https://genius.com/Black-star-respiration-best-of-decade-i-version-lyrics
Better The Devil,UnKnown,UnKnown,"(Blackstar;Walker)
I have made my bed and now it is time to lie down
Dark clown eternal with a permanent wry frown
Still holding out with pessimistic hope
Better the devil you know than the one that you do not
Better the devil you know than the one that you do not
I should have known
I should have known
Better the devil you know than the one that you do not
I know I know
I should have known
I should have known
Better the devil you know than the one that you do not
Hold your loved ones close and your enemies closer
I guess they never ever come any colder
Lash it out give them enough rope
Better the devil you know than the one that you do not",https://genius.com/Black-star-better-the-devil-lyrics
Black Star’s “K.O.S. (Determination)”,UnKnown,UnKnown,"So many emcees focusin on black people extermination
We keep it balanced with that knowledge of self, determination
It's hot, we be blowin the spots, with conversations
C'mon let's smooth it out like Soul Sensation
We in the house like Japanese in Japan, or Koreans in Korea
Head to Philly and free Mumia with the Kujichagulia TRUE
Singin is swingin and writin is fightin, but what
They writin got us clashin like titans it's not excitin
No question, bein a black man is demandin
The fire's in my eyes and the flames need fannin (3X)
With that what? (Knowledge Of Self) Determination
*repeat 4X*

Things I say and do, may not come quite through
My words may not convey just what I'm feelin

Yes yes come on, yes yes
Knowledge Of Self is like life after death
With that you never worry about your last breath
Death comes, that's how I'm livin, it's the next days
The flesh goes underground, the book of life, flip the page
Yo they askin me how old, we livin the same age
I feel the rage of a million niggas locked inside a cage
At exactly which point do you start to realize
That life without knowledge is, death in disguise?
That's why, Knowledge Of Self is like life after death
Apply it, to your life, let destiny manifest
Different day, same confusion, we're gonna take this
Hip-hop shit and keep it movin, shed a little light
Now y'all bloomin like a flower with the power of the evident
Voices and drums original instruments
In the flesh presently presentin my representation
With that what? (Knowledge Of Self) Determination
*repeat 6X*
- - - - these two parts overlap - - - -
Things I say and do, may not come quite through
My words may not convey just what I'm feelin
*repeat 2X*

The most important time in history is, NOW, the present
So count your blessings cause time can't define the essence
But you stressin over time and you follow the Roman calendar
These people into cloning like Gattaca, you can bet
They tryin to lock you down like Attica, the African diaspora
Represents strength in numbers, a giant can't slumber forever
I know you gotta get that cheddar whatever
Aiyyo I heard you twice the first time money, get it together
You must be History, you repeatin yourself out of the pages
You keepin yourself depleatin your spiritual wealth
That quick cash'll get your ass quick fast in houses of detention
Inner-city concentration camps where no one pays attention
Or mentions the ascension of death, til nothing's left
The young, gifted and Black are sprung addicted to crack
All my people where y'all at cause, y'all ain't here
And your hero's using your mind as a canvas to paint fear
With, broad brush strokes and tales of incarceration
You get out of jail with that Knowledge of Self determination
Stand in ovation, cause you put the Hue in Human
Cause and effect, effect everything you do
And that's why I got love in the face of hate
Hands steady so the lines in the mental illustration is straight
The thought you had don't even contemplate
Infinite like figure eight there's no escape..
From that what? (Knowledge Of Self) Determination
*repeat 4X*

Things I say and do, may not come quite through
My words may not convey just what I'm feelin
*repeat 2X*

This the funky singing by Miss Vinia Mojica
This the funky singing by Miss Vinia Mojica

Things I say and do, may not come quite through
My words may not convey just what I'm feelin
*repeat 2X*
What I'm feelin, what I'm feelin, ooooh, what I'm feelin...",https://genius.com/Black-star-black-stars-kos-determination-lyrics
Waste Of Space,UnKnown,UnKnown,"You would like to think you know it all
You would like to think you have got it sussed
Well you are a real hopeless fool
Too much in love with lady luck
Well take a look at yourself
When are you going to realise
Well get out of my sight
Because it is you i despise
Well that is right
Yeah so long
You are going to have to face it
That you are nothing but a waste of
That is right
Yeah so long
You are going to have to face it
That you are nothing but a waste of space
You are such a waste
Nothing more than a waste of space
You are always out to lunch
Always too blind to see
You are just a tourist in another persons reality
Well take a look at yourself
Tell me can you see the signs
A real fool with no hope
I think you know",https://genius.com/Black-star-waste-of-space-lyrics
